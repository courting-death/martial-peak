## Chapter 1560 — Extinguishing the Fire

"This is outrageous!" Meng Wuya ground his teeth, inwardly full of hatred, and angrily slapped the armrest of his chair.

He had assumed Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang were lost in lovers' tenderness, wrapped in each other and forgetting the passage of time.

It had been over a month, and the two still had not appeared, leaving the human, yao, and demon experts here to wait in boredom; Meng Wuya felt ashamed before these guests.

He had guarded Xia Ningshang for so many years and carefully instructed her—he was Xia Ningshang's only kin.

Yet now, the moment Yang Kai returned, he had snatched his precious disciple away from Meng Wuya's side!

Meng Wuya knew this time she had been truly taken; in Xia Ningshang's heart he, as her master, would likely be pushed to the sidelines, and that thought left him a little sour.

Sourness mixed with sweetness—after all, the disciple had waited alone in hardship for thirty years and it had not been in vain; that bastard Yang Kai had finally come back.

It felt rather strange; Meng Wuya shook his head and his heart churned with a mixture of feelings that were hard to describe.

Below, several Great Yao Lords and the Demon Generals faced each other across the air. The powerhouses of the two races sat on opposite sides, their gazes clashing midair. The atmosphere was subtle—yet faintly tense, as if a spark could ignite it at any moment.

Although the three races had once allied thirty years ago, over the years there had been many frictions over cultivation resources, the conflict between the yao and the demons being the most severe.

Fortunately the Great Yao Lords and the Demon Generals restrained themselves and did not personally intervene; otherwise the conflict would surely have escalated.

It was only the underlings having petty scuffles—no great harm done.

Normally, it wouldn’t matter since they rarely met, but now that they had all come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land together—and after idling here for over a month—their tempers were wearing thin. Feeling the growing tension, Meng Wuya sensed he could barely keep these two races’ powerhouses from turning on each other.

Were it not for the three human top experts in the Saint Realm—himself, Ling Taixu, and Chu Lingxiao—stationed here, those fierce fellows would likely have come to blows.

What a headache! That bastard had fallen into the land of tenderness and cared nothing for the old men's suffering.

At this moment Meng Wuya cursed Yang Kai in his heart until there was nothing left intact.

Just as he feared, trouble came. No one knew whether it was a Great Yao Lord or a Demon General who first lost their temper, but an argument suddenly broke out below. At first, only two were quarreling face to face—but the situation quickly escalated, with the other Great Yao Lords and Demon Generals all joining in to back their own side.

The situation became somewhat chaotic.

In the end even Great Lord Lei Long and Demon Lord Changyuan waded into the muddy waters.

"Lei Long, in recent years I have secluded myself and gained some insight, but found no chance to test it—why not use this precious land today? Shall we spar?" Changyuan said with a smile as he looked at Great Lord Lei Long, his gaze filled with a pressing combative intent.

“Excellent. I’ve had some gains over the years myself and was just worrying I had no opponent to test them on. I’ve long heard that Brother Changyuan’s Heaven Profound Sealing Art is unrivaled in its subtlety—even Elder Meng once suffered under it. I’d very much like to experience it firsthand.” Lei Long smiled slightly, calm and unafraid.

"Don't drag me into this!" Meng Wuya immediately protested.

Being struck by Changyuan's Tianxuan Sealing Art and having most of his cultivation sealed, forcing him to flee to Zhongdu to avoid calamity, was a lifelong shame to him.

Although Changyuan had used arrays to aid his victory then, Meng Wuya least liked to hear the matter mentioned.

Down below, Lei Long and Changyuan had already engaged; the two made no great movements, merely releasing their Divine Sense to collide silently.

But such a contest was far more perilous than a conventional fight—one slip could mean mutual destruction, even soul-scattering.

Everyone in the great hall wore grave expressions; the earlier noise gradually subsided and no one dared speak, all tensely watching the experts of their own races for fear of accidents.

The Divine Sense of those at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm swept across the entire hall; any expert who felt that collision showed terror in their eyes.

The battle quickly reached a white-hot stage; Lei Long and Changyuan both gave their all, yet remained evenly matched.

Both fighters' complexions slowly paled and fine sweat beaded on their brows; their Divine Senses tangled and collided with extreme danger.

Meng Wuya and the others' faces tightened, looking ill at ease.

They could no longer intervene; they could only silently await the outcome of Lei Long and Changyuan's duel, and judging by the present situation the best that could happen was mutual destruction.

If that were to occur, the conflict would surely escalate—something the human experts did not wish to see.

"Where has Yang Kai gone?" Ling Taixu asked anxiously.

Meng Wuya shook his head, indicating he had no idea; a few days earlier he had gone to the secret chamber where Xia Ningshang had been in seclusion but found no trace of Yang Kai or his disciple—no one knew where the two had gone.

"This is not good." Chu Lingxiao, Sect Master of the Tianxiao Sect, frowned—events had developed beyond his expectations.

At that moment a hearty laugh suddenly came from outside the door.

"What a lively scene—already fighting?"

As the voice fell, a shadow flashed outside the door and Yang Kai appeared, accompanied by Xia Ningshang with her face veiled in black gauze.

The sound drew everyone's attention; they looked up and were instantly alert.

Many had heard of Yang Kai's return but had not fully believed it until this moment when they saw him with their own eyes.

Meng Wuya eyed Xia Ningshang suspiciously; after more than a month apart he suddenly felt his disciple had changed, becoming someone he could only look up to in awe...

"Junior Nephew!" a coquettish cry rang out as a pretty figure dashed from the hall and sprang before Yang Kai, inspecting him up and down with a teasing cluck; after a while she lightly nodded, "Hm, decades apart and you've become even more manly—enough to stir the old Senior Aunt's heart."

Yang Kai’s face darkened; he instinctively glanced at Xia Ningshang and said awkwardly, “Senior Aunt, could you at least try to act your age and be a bit more dignified?”

Fei Yu, that Senior Aunt, immediately shot Yang Kai a look, fully the picture of intoxicating charm.

She had come with Chu Lingxiao; upon receiving word from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land that Yang Kai had returned, Chu Lingxiao had brought the Four Elders of the sect.

Upon meeting again, Senior Aunt Fei Yu's behavior was hardly proper.

Yang Kai felt a warmth in his chest; when he had lived on Qixiu Peak of the Tianxiao Sect with Senior Aunt Fei Yu, she had always been this sort—often drunkenly sprawled on the ground, clothing disordered and exposing herself, without the slightest shame before Yang Kai.

After dozens of years, feeling that peculiar ardor from his Senior Aunt once more, Yang Kai suddenly felt as though an entire lifetime had passed.

“Act my age? I’m still in my prime,” Fei Yu snorted softly, then flashed a playful smile. “Cang Yan, Li Wan, and Fei Jian all came too—and even Grandmaster is here!”

Saying this, she glanced toward the great hall.

Yang Kai lightly inclined his head and stepped forward, speaking a few words with Cang Yan and the other Senior Uncles, then with a solemn expression approached Chu Lingxiao and said in a low voice, "Disciple Yang Kai pays respects to Grandmaster; sorry to have kept you waiting."

"Very well, there's no need for such formality." Chu Lingxiao nodded with pleasure, releasing his Divine Sense to sweep Yang Kai; he found, just as Ling Taixu and the others had said, that Yang Kai's realm and cultivation were now unfathomable and beyond his probing.

Realizing this, Chu Lingxiao's smile grew even gentler: "You are excellent, truly excellent. You have indeed forged your own path; I am proud of you. It seems the task of revitalizing the Sect may have to be entrusted to you in the future!"

"You flatter me, Grandmaster. I still have many shortcomings and need guidance from you and Master."

"Good child." Chu Lingxiao laughed with delight and exchanged a glance with Ling Taixu, their hearts at ease.

"Grandmaster, wait a moment—these two are hot-tempered; let me put out their fire first." Yang Kai grinned and turned to the combatants, Lei Long and Changyuan.

"Be careful; do not injure them," Ling Taixu warned hastily.

"Don't worry, Grandmaster, they won't be harmed." Yang Kai's face brimmed with pride as his Divine Sense erupted and poured into the void.

For the others the clash of two Third Stage of the Saint Realm Divine Senses was terrifying and none dared intervene; to Yang Kai, however, such a contest seemed like child's play.

A hissing seemed to pass through the void; Lei Long and Changyuan both trembled as they felt their entangled Divine Senses being forcibly separated by an invisible pair of hands.

The force made them feel utterly powerless—completely unable to resist!

Boom...

A ring of light exploded outward in all directions; Lei Long and Changyuan each staggered back several paces, drawing a deep breath and staring at Yang Kai in stunned amazement.

He had effortlessly torn them apart.

"Sirs, I apologize for keeping you waiting. Indeed I ran into some unexpected events that caused the delay, but there's no need to be so hostile the moment we meet." Yang Kai smiled pleasantly at them.

Lei Long drew a long breath, still calming his emotions, and after a moment cupped his fist and said, "My apologies."

Changyuan was not a petty man; seeing Lei Long speak thus he gave a chuckle and said, "Thanks to Saint Lord Yang. If I have offended, please forgive me."

"That's better—living under the same sky, why meet only to fight and kill?" Yang Kai nodded lightly, pleased with their attitude; seeing many still staring at him with strange looks, he gestured and said, "Sit, don't be formal. I called you here today to discuss a matter."

"Heh, upon learning Saint Lord Yang had returned I sped from the Demon Capital to the Sacred Land day and night; but what business does Saint Lord Yang summon us for? With human, yao, and demon experts all assembled, it must be something of great consequence." Changyuan asked casually, though deep wariness flickered in his eyes.

Just now Yang Kai had separated him and Lei Long; although he had not sensed the full extent, Changyuan knew Yang Kai was no longer someone he could match.
