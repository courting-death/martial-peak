## Chapter 893 — One Wave After Another

Hearing his daughter say that, the middle-aged man could only force an awkward smile.

The Duao Alliance isn't a particularly strong force; as its leader, he himself had only reached the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

On this continent, any faction without a Saint Realm figure guarding it is habitually looked down upon by others.

So his whole life he had striven to reach the Saint Realm; recently he had finally seen a glimmer of hope, but his talents proved insufficient to grasp the secret of sainthood. He then thought to find someone to refine a Heavenly Secret Pill and see if he could rely on the pill's power to ascend into the Saint Realm.

He spent vast sums and manpower to gather the ingredients, yet he could not find a suitable alchemist to perform the refinement.

The famed pill-masters across the continent were arrogant, unlikely to receive outsiders, and their schedules were booked a year or two ahead. The middle-aged man met setback after setback and could not visit any of them.

It was at that moment the renown of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s pill-refining reached him, jolting his spirits—he secretly felt this might be his chance.

Because his daughter had some acquaintance with the Saint Lord there, he even suspected the two might share a more complex relationship.

But no matter how he probed, his daughter adamantly denied it.

With no choice, he had to come here first and plan from there.

The long line outside the Nine Peaks startled the middle-aged man; he hadn't expected so many people would already be waiting when he arrived.

Failing to dissuade his daughter, he could only comfort himself and wait.

It would only be about a month, after all.

He said no more.

Just then another two people arrived from behind: a young woman accompanied by a Third Stage Transcendent expert who seemed to be acting as her guard.

The young woman was startled when she came upon the scene; she gazed into the distance, covered her mouth, and exclaimed, “So many people—are all these here to request pills?”

The Third Stage Transcendent cultivator at her side also scanned the scene and nodded: “Miss, I heard on the way here that the pill-master within is unparalleled. Since he began refining pills he has never failed, and the pills he produces are extraordinarily fine; naturally many have come seeking him.”

“Impressive—where did that bastard hire such a pill-master?” The young woman pursed her lips and laughed, fixing her gaze on the Nine Peaks with a casual air.

“Miss, shall we queue up and wait?” the cultivator asked softly.

“Hmph, we’ll just go straight in to find him—he wouldn’t dare pretend not to know me.” She snorted, her nose high and proud, and strode forward without a hint of joining the line.

After a few steps she paused with a soft, surprised sound, turned toward someone near the end of the queue, and when she recognized the face she brightened and hurried over, calling out, “Yun Xuan, what are you doing here?”

Yun Xuan looked weighed down with worry and hadn't noticed the newcomer. At the call she suddenly looked up, just in time to see the young woman approaching.

“Shui Ling?” Yun Xuan said under her breath, a smile blooming on her pretty face. “What are you doing here?”

“To see that bastard! I heard he’s already become the master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—gone off to the heights in a few years without telling me a thing. I’ve been worried sick; I came here to give him a piece of my mind.”

Shui Ling chattered away; hearing her, Yun Xuan couldn't help but smile slightly, her mood clearly lifted.

“Are you here to have the master refine your pills?” Shui Ling's eyes flicked, already guessing Yun Xuan’s purpose.

“Yes.”

“If you’re here anyway, why stand in line? Just go straight in.” Shui Ling looked puzzled.

“That wouldn’t be proper—everyone’s waiting in line…” Yun Xuan looked embarrassed.

“What’s there to fear? Others waiting is their business… you’re not a stranger to him.”

“No, we’ll wait here.” Yun Xuan waved her hand repeatedly.

Seeing her aloof manner, Shui Ling’s brows drew together and she suddenly reacted, “Could it be he’s turned his back on you? Even if he’s the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, he shouldn’t be that shameless!”

“Don’t say it so loudly!” Yun Xuan blushed and hurried to hush her.

A few disciples of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land nearby turned to look with dark expressions. Shui Ling stuck out her tongue and dared not be impudent any further.

Before Yang Kai she could be completely freewheeling, but in front of these Sacred Land disciples, speaking ill of the Saint Lord might provoke their hostility.

“Xuan’er, this young lady is—” the middle-aged man who had been standing behind Yun Xuan stepped forward and asked.

“Oh, this is the young princess of the Water Divine Hall, Shui Ling; I told you about her before, Father.”

“Princess Shui Ling!” The middle-aged man’s expression changed and he bowed respectfully, “I am Yun Cheng, leader of the Duao Alliance.”

“Uncle Yun!” Shui Ling smiled sweetly and addressed him crisply.

“The Water Divine Hall’s young princess is worthy of her title—so young and already at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm. Her future will surely be boundless.” Yun Cheng’s divine sense skimmed over Shui Ling and revealed her true cultivation; he was impressed by the Water Divine Hall’s foundation.

Yun Xuan was older than Shui Ling, but lagged behind in realm; this was simply a reflection of the differing strengths and resources of their respective factions—without good resources, young people grow slower.

“Uncle Yun flatters me; I only just broke through recently and my realm is not yet stable.” Shui Ling answered obediently; her water-blue eyes were very pretty, drawing many glances.

“Her name is Ruan Xinyu; she’s my friend,” Yun Xuan introduced the other woman at her side.

Shui Ling nodded slightly in greeting.

“Just now Shui Ling said she planned to go straight to the Nine Peaks to seek out the Saint Lord?” Yun Cheng lowered his voice to ask.

“Yes, he and I are old acquaintances—haven’t seen him in years. I didn’t expect he’d gone to be the Saint Lord here. I’m also here to ask him to refine some pills… Uncle Yun, do you want to come? Yun Xuan is also acquainted with him.”

“Wouldn't that be improper?” Yun Cheng hesitated.

“It’s fine—I mainly came to see him; it’s not the same as others,” Shui Ling giggled.

“Then I won’t be modest; I’ll take advantage of Shui Ling’s favor this time!” Yun Cheng laughed and no longer restrained himself.

“Uncle Yun, you flatter me.”

With that Shui Ling headed toward the stone pavilion; Yun Cheng hurried after her.

Yun Xuan hesitated for a moment, and at Ruan Xinyu’s urging, had to fall in with the others.

People in the queue kept glancing over, eyes wary and hostile.

Those waiting here for pills naturally disliked anyone breaking the rules. Not knowing Shui Ling and the others’ intentions, they kept quiet for now and watched to see what would happen.

At the stone pavilion Shui Ling entered and told elders Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong her purpose; the two elders frowned as they examined the group.

Since Yang Kai had taken control of the Nine Peaks and become the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, nobody had come to visit him; the elders knew nothing about his acquaintances.

Still, since a rare visitor had come, Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong were not overly impatient; they said, “We must first inform the Saint Lord—please wait here a moment.”

“Very well.” Shui Ling bowed slightly, quietly resolving that when she saw Yang Kai she would give him a piece of her mind—she had come tens of thousands of li to check on him, and to be forced to wait for orders was too insulting.

It was simply too much.

A Sacred Land disciple was dispatched into the Nine Peaks.

Before long, while those within the peaks had yet to report back, another group arrived from outside. Like Shui Ling’s party, they had not queued but went straight to the stone pavilion.

This group was peculiar: each elder had white hair and looked very aged. Their fine garments marked them as no ordinary folk.

Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong exchanged glances, suspicious about who they might be.

These elders’ cultivation was not high—only Second or Third Stage; not one of them reached the Saint Realm—yet their manner and bearing were arrogant, as if they held the queue in contempt.

They strode to the stone pavilion, and one smiling elder stepped up to Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong, asking, “Ladies, may I ask if this is the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?”

The two elders’ brows knit.

Though they appeared young, both were Saint Realm experts.

No one weaker than them had ever dared to address them as “ladies,” which made the elders suspect these visitors of affectation.

Yet the question came naturally from the elder’s lips, without a hint of pretense.

Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong did not presume to be rude; they rose and the former nodded: “Yes.”

“Is the master here called Yang Kai?”

“That is correct.”

“Then we’re at the right place. Ah—these old bones, trekking over mountains and rivers, I’m exhausted!” The elder sighed heavily and called back to his companions, “We’ve arrived; we can rest soon!”

The elders behind him visibly relaxed, wearing relieved expressions.

“May I ask your names and what relation you have with our Saint Lord?” Yu Ying asked softly.

“Heh, just tell your Saint Lord that a few like-minded old friends have come to visit,” the elder said without revealing his name, sounding enigmatic.

Yu Ying frowned slightly and, after exchanging a look with Cheng Yuetong, did not press further; she ordered disciples to send word into the peaks.

They found it curious: Yang Kai had been master of the Nine Peaks for some time without visitors, yet today guests arrived in waves.

They hoped it wasn't all people trying to curry favor for pill-refinement, the two elders thought as they watched the successive waves of visitors claiming to be Yang Kai’s friends.
