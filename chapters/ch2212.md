## Chapter 2212 — Heavenly Yao Mountain Range

The object Yang Kai referred to was a saber—a saber he had yet to fully refine and had barely ever used.

Unexpectedly, it too had passed through the Divine Roaming Mirror, arriving here with his Spirit Body!

This discovery left Yang Kai both shocked and pleasantly surprised. He had obtained this saber many years ago, but this was the first time he realized it was actually a Divine Soul Secret Treasure. Now that he had it at his side, perhaps it could prove invaluable in a moment of crisis.

While his thoughts shifted, Yang Kai’s expression remained unchanged.

Gao Xueting glanced at him, checked the defensive strength of his Ziyang Profound Light Barrier, and nodded slightly.

After all, she had only recently given this Secret Treasure to Yang Kai. For him to refine it to the point of complete control in such a short time was truly impressive.

After a while, seeing that everyone had finished their checks, Gao Xueting finally spoke: “Next, I will take you to a place. It is where disciples of the Shrine come to temper themselves each time they enter. You are to train there diligently—absolutely no wandering off!”

“Yes!” everyone responded in unison.

However, Xia Sheng keenly sensed something and looked at Gao Xueting suspiciously. “Elder Gao, you’re not coming with us?”

From her words, it seemed Gao Xueting would only escort them there and would not stay.

Gao Xueting shook her head. “I have other important matters to attend to. But don’t worry, that training ground isn’t too dangerous. As long as you behave, there shouldn’t be any major problems.”

“I understand,” Xia Sheng replied solemnly with a nod. “Elder Gao, please rest assured. As long as I am here, I will ensure everyone’s safety.”

Gao Xueting gave him an approving look, waved her fair hand, and said, “Let’s go!”

As she spoke, she sped off in a certain direction.

The group hurried to follow.

Along the way, they would occasionally encounter Demonic Beasts blocking their path. Whenever this happened, Gao Xueting would have one of Yang Kai’s group step forward to fight, allowing them to get a feel for their own condition and to better understand the nature of the local creatures.

All the Dao Origin Realm cultivators were elites among elites. Naturally, their adaptability was beyond reproach, so after a day, everyone had basically overcome their initial discomfort and could fight with ease.

Overall, fighting with a Spirit Body meant one’s strength was much lower than when using a physical body, and the means available in battle were also far fewer.

This was only natural. Without a physical body, ordinary Secret Treasures, or the ability to use most secret techniques, everyone could only rely on Divine Soul Secret Treasures or pure soul energy attacks in battle.

So, battles in the Divine Roaming Mirror were mostly simple and direct, without any flashy posturing or dazzling techniques.

Yang Kai’s uniqueness was on full display here.

Outside, others only paid attention to his cultivation. The First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was nothing in the eyes of true experts.

But in this world dominated by Spirit Bodies, Yang Kai stood out.

The strength of his Spirit Body even slightly surpassed Xia Sheng’s, not to mention Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao.

He had the lowest cultivation among everyone, but after entering the Divine Roaming Mirror, he suddenly became the strongest. Such brilliance could not be hidden.

This stark contrast naturally left Xia Sheng and the others amazed. Each was curious how he had cultivated his soul to that level.

But since they weren’t from the same sect, it wasn’t appropriate to ask about such personal secrets.

After a day’s journey, a vast mountain range appeared before everyone’s eyes, its peaks rising and falling in endless succession, stretching out for who knew how many li.

Gao Xueting led the group to a stop at the foot of the mountain.

“This is the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range within the Divine Roaming Mirror world. Inside, Demonic Beasts are countless. Once you enter, you may hunt freely to obtain Divine Soul Origins and strengthen your Divine Sense. But let me remind you: there are some Demonic Beasts in the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range that even I cannot provoke. So do not go too deep—if you stay within the outer twenty thousand li, there shouldn’t be much danger.”

Hearing this, everyone’s expression grew serious, and they nodded in understanding.

“The Heavenly Yao Mountain Range doesn’t just have Demonic Beasts. There are also martial artists from within the Divine Roaming Mirror who travel here. If you encounter them, try not to interact. Even if you do, do not reveal any information about the outside world—this is very important! Of course, besides that, there are also things like Soul Jade and Soul Crystals that I mentioned before. My own Middle-Level Soul Jade was obtained here.”

Upon hearing this, everyone’s eyes lit up, and they couldn’t help but rub their hands in anticipation.

“Also, your Spirit Bodies cannot be separated from your physical bodies for too long, or unpredictable consequences may occur. So, your training time here is limited to one month! After one month, a restriction on the tokens in the stone chamber will activate and forcibly pull your Spirit Bodies back. Make good use of this time.”

“Elder…” Murong Xiaoxiao suddenly asked, “If we encounter danger we can’t handle… what should we do?”

“Run!” Gao Xueting replied concisely. “If you can’t escape, stall for time—hold out until the month is up.” As she spoke, her beautiful eyes swept over everyone. “This is your trial. If you can’t endure…”

She frowned slightly and didn’t finish, but everyone understood her meaning.

The growth of a martial artist is always accompanied by danger, so everyone was already used to the situation and had no complaints.

“Alright, I’ve brought you this far. From here on, it’s up to you. Go on in.” After speaking, Gao Xueting waved her hand at the group.

Xia Sheng and the others exchanged glances, then nodded and headed toward the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range.

Gao Xueting stood quietly in place, waiting until everyone’s figures disappeared from view. Only then did she flicker and shoot off in another direction.

This time, Gao Xueting entered the Divine Roaming Mirror for two reasons: to guide Xia Sheng and the others and explain the local customs, and also to refine a Divine Soul Secret Treasure of her own in a special place here.

That Divine Soul Secret Treasure had followed her for many years, infused with her Emperor Intent and nourished by her own Emperor Yuan. It was already close to advancing to the level of an Imperial Treasure.

A Divine Soul Secret Treasure at the Imperial Treasure level was extremely rare. Looking across the entire Star Realm, there were very few.

Ordinary Emperor Realm cultivators might have one or two painstakingly refined Imperial Treasures, but as for Divine Soul Imperial Treasures… ninety-nine percent of Emperor Realm cultivators had never possessed one.

If this operation succeeded, Gao Xueting would have one herself. Then, when facing enemies, she could attack with her full mind, no longer needing to defend against gaps in her Divine Sense.

This would be a huge, invisible advantage.

The last time she entered the Divine Roaming Mirror world, she had saved the life of a martial artist here. That martial artist was also at the Emperor Realm, but had been gravely injured while being chased by a fierce Demonic Beast.

Seeing this, Gao Xueting didn’t hesitate to help. Together, they managed to kill the Demonic Beast.

Grateful for her help, the martial artist invited Gao Xueting to visit his Sect.

Gao Xueting also wanted to learn more about the Divine Roaming Mirror world, so she naturally accepted.

After arriving at the so-called Soul Seizing Sect, Gao Xueting learned that the person she had saved was actually the Sect Master.

The Soul Seizing Sect’s Sect Master was not particularly sinister. Grateful for Gao Xueting’s life-saving grace, he treated her as an honored guest. Elder Gao was strong and beautiful—aside from her cold demeanor, she was nearly perfect.

So, the Sect Master was especially courteous to Gao Xueting, frequently trying to win her favor.

It was during a casual conversation last time that Gao Xueting learned there was a special place in the Soul Seizing Sect called Divine Condensation Lake, which could help her Divine Soul Secret Treasure advance.

This time, Gao Xueting planned to visit the Soul Seizing Sect and ask the Sect Master to let her use the Divine Condensation Lake.

In her view, with her life-saving favor, there shouldn’t be any problem.

……

Elsewhere in the Divine Roaming Mirror world, there was a massive city spanning tens of thousands of li, vast beyond measure. The city walls were over a dozen zhang high, enclosing the city like an iron barrel.

From afar, a grand, majestic aura swept forth.

Inside the city, crowds surged, shoulder to shoulder, bustling with activity.

Although this city was within the Divine Roaming Mirror, at first glance it was almost indistinguishable from cities in the outside world. Vendors and shops lined the streets, wide avenues crisscrossed, and pavilions and towers were scattered everywhere.

This was the capital of the Divine Roaming Nation—Divine Roaming City!

Unlike the outside world, where Sects and countless families each controlled their own territory and ruled as they pleased—

In the Divine Roaming Mirror world, it was the Divine Roaming Nation that ruled all!

All Sects and families were under the jurisdiction of the Divine Roaming Nation, which held the highest status and authority, leading everything here!

It was said that long ago, there was no Divine Roaming Nation here. The world’s structure was the same as outside, with families and Sects each occupying their own land and ruling as they wished.

But ever since the current monarch of the Divine Roaming Nation appeared, he swept through the land like a gale, unifying the entire nation. Under his command, none dared disobey.

The current monarch possessed world-shaking talent and the power to create worlds! He gathered a great number of experts to serve him. His grand and imposing image was known to all, and his unparalleled achievements were widely praised.

Under his rule, the Divine Roaming Nation flourished, with a bright future ahead!

Although this world was almost entirely under his control, the rise of the Divine Roaming Nation did indeed prevent much unnecessary slaughter and conflict—this was a supreme merit.
