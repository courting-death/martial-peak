## Chapter 1063 — A Bet

Which herb could possibly grow for such an age? Over ten thousand years, calamities, oceans turning to mulberry fields and back, any sudden event could wipe a herb from the world—such a plant is practically impossible to find.

Other precious herbs, however, though tremendously valuable, are not difficult to hunt down. The Hengluo Commerce Guild focuses on trade; once the matter is entrusted to people like Halika, Yang Kai believed the other ingredients would soon be gathered.

A single Resurrection Soul-Gathering Flower with ten thousand years of medicinal age rendered Yang Kai utterly helpless in an instant!

“Women are a dime a dozen under heaven. You’re young, boy; you still have plenty of time to live—surely you’ll meet outstanding women. Sometimes you must let go when it’s time… hm, letting go is a kind of happiness too.” Zong Ao murmured, touched, his voice heavy with feeling.

“I must save her!” Yang Kai shook his head, eyes resolute. “Senior, is there truly no other way to resolve her peril?”

Zong Ao looked at him long and hard, his expression growing grave. After a while he said, “There is also a pill that might work, and its materials aren’t hard to find; the pill itself isn’t of very high rank.”

Yang Kai brightened at once and breathed in a hopeful low voice: “Please, Senior, point me the way!”

“Very well. Since you’re so lovesick, I’ll give you one more hint.” Zong Ao sighed and said leisurely, “But I still advise you not to hold too high hopes.”

“Please speak, Senior.”

“Leaving Flame Pill!” Zong Ao spat out a few words.

“Leaving Flame Pill?” Yang Kai frowned and thought quickly. After a moment his eyes widened in surprise: “A Saint King-Grade Lower-Level Leaving Flame Pill?”

“Correct. The Leaving Flame Pill is indeed a Saint King-Grade Lower-Level pill!” Zong Ao nodded lightly.

Yang Kai’s face showed puzzlement. “Senior, I don’t quite understand. The Leaving Flame Pill isn’t a high-rank pill—how can it dispel the danger on my Lady?”

He truly didn’t understand. Zong Ao’s first solution had been to refine a Void King-Grade pill; the second was a Saint King-Grade pill. The gulf between them was like heaven and earth.

Zong Ao gave a sly chuckle and grinned: “You think it’s an ordinary Leaving Flame Pill? I mean a Leaving Flame Pill that grows Pill Patterns and a Pill Cloud!”

Yang Kai was struck fiercely; enlightenment dawned in his heart.

“Since you’re also a pill refiner, you should know that once a pill develops Pill Patterns and then a Pill Cloud, its medicinal effect increases geometrically. That’s why pills with Pill Patterns and Pill Clouds are worth so much more. A Saint King-Grade Lower-Level Leaving Flame Pill that sprouts Pill Patterns can have an effect roughly equal to a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level; if it forms a Pill Cloud, even if it’s not quite on par with a Void King-Grade pill, the gap is slight.”

“I understand.” Yang Kai’s eyes shone with spirit; he regained his composure in an instant.

Zong Ao watched his expression and sneered coldly: “But a Leaving Flame Pill that forms a Pill Cloud isn’t so easily refined. That may be harder than finding a ten-thousand-year Resurrection Soul-Gathering Flower. I still say, boy, give it up early—don’t waste your efforts.”

He wasn’t trying to crush Yang Kai’s morale; he was simply stating the facts.

Even the top refineries in the Hengluo Star Domain might not be able to produce a Pill Cloud.

Yang Kai grinned: “How can you know until you try?”

Zong Ao hurried to make a stance: “Don’t get any ideas about me helping you refine it; I won’t. I don’t owe you anything. Besides, I don’t have the power to guarantee producing a Saint King-Grade pill with a Pill Cloud.”

“I didn’t mean to ask you to refine it.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“Oh? You already have someone in mind?” Zong Ao was a little surprised. “Tell me—who will you seek? I can advise and see if that person has the ability.”

He didn’t think anyone on Rainfall Star surpassed him in pill-crafting. In his view, he was the best.

“I’ll refine it myself!”

“You yourself?” Zong Ao’s eyes nearly popped out.

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Zong Ao seemed to reassess him, appraising him head to toe. After a long while his expression turned odd: “If you insist on making a fool of yourself, I won’t stop you. Hm—if you can truly refine a Leaving Flame Pill that forms a Pill Cloud, I’ll call you ‘grandfather’!”

He simply didn’t believe Yang Kai had the ability.

Yang Kai was only a warrior at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; even if he had talent in pill-crafting and some aptitude, at best he’d spent twenty years in the craft.

Saint-Grade Upper-Level pills were his limit, Zong Ao concluded.

If he couldn’t even refine a Saint King-Grade pill, how could he produce the supreme Pill Cloud?

Zong Ao took his words for teenage hotheadedness.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he smiled strangely: “Senior, I can’t accept that title… Since you distrust me so, shall we make a bet?”

“A bet?” Zong Ao’s gaze narrowed. He snorted: “What bet? Propose your terms and I’ll accept.”

“If I can refine a Leaving Flame Pill that forms a Pill Cloud, I won’t ask for much—just half of that Profound Yin Moon Water.” Yang Kai’s burning gaze fixed on Zong Ao.

Zong Ao’s face twitched. He snorted: “Boy, you look so meek normally, turns out you’ve been hiding tricks—trying to take my treasures, huh? Aren’t you afraid of losing a tooth?”

“If I lose a tooth, it’ll be my own doing.” Yang Kai shook his head slowly. “Senior, are you afraid you’ll lose?”

Zong Ao snarled: “Don’t try to rile me. I’m done with such clumsy tricks.”

Though he said that, Zong Ao added: “Very well. If you truly produce a Leaving Flame Pill with a Pill Cloud, I’ll give you half the Profound Yin Moon Water. I’ve studied Pill Patterns for centuries and never found the key—if you surpass me I’ll accept it. But what if you can’t?”

He stared at Yang Kai coldly, his expression hostile.

Yang Kai’s proposed wager angered him. He felt slighted, as if Yang Kai belittled the art and discounted his years of research; a murderous glint stirred in his heart.

“As Senior wishes!” Yang Kai replied straightforwardly. In any case, if the Pill could not be refined, Xue Yue would undoubtedly die — and once she died, he would be in trouble as well.

“Good. I need a lackey; if you fail, you’ll be my laborer for life!” Zong Ao cackled. “But the bet needs a deadline; otherwise I’ll wait forever.”

“Naturally.” Yang Kai seemed to have expected this. “The deadline is when my Lady dies—how about that?”

“That’s within a year or two. You’re arrogant, boy. I’ll watch closely to see how you refine a Leaving Flame Pill with a Pill Cloud!” Zong Ao laughed heartily.

“Senior, wait and see.” Yang Kai grinned widely, utterly unflustered and full of confidence.

Zong Ao imprinted that visage on his mind, wondering whether the boy was bluffing or truly confident.

He asked anxiously: “With your current skill, what’s the highest rank pill you can refine?”

“Saint King-Grade Lower-Level!” Yang Kai replied offhand.

“Impossible!” Zong Ao was stunned. “You claim you can refine a Saint King-Grade pill?”

He simply didn’t believe it and thought Yang Kai was exaggerating.

Yang Kai shrugged: “I have indeed refined one.”

“How old are you?” Zong Ao asked suspiciously.

“Under thirty—twenty-seven or twenty-eight, perhaps?” Yang Kai wasn’t certain. Long years traveling and seclusion had blurred his sense of time and age.

That someone so young could craft a Saint King-Grade pill shocked Zong Ao to silence.

A sudden uneasy feeling came over him—half his Profound Yin Moon Water seemed likely to change hands.

After shaking his head, Zong Ao said: “In a year or two the matter will become clear. I won’t pry now. But mark this: even if you produce a Leaving Flame Pill with a Pill Cloud, it can only purge the Profound Yin Moon Water’s poison so she won’t die suddenly; the trouble of her scattered Spirit Body you’ll still have to resolve yourself.”

Yang Kai frowned and cupped his fists: “I understand.”

“Leave.” Zong Ao waved his hand.

Yang Kai withdrew and looked at sleeping Xue Yue once more before departing for a branch of the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

Half a day later, Yang Kai met Halika and the others in the great hall among the mountains.

Halika, Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman gathered around a table where an instrument crafted from Five-Colored Meteor Essence held ten drops of Profound Yin Moon Water, each like a pearl—crystal and translucent.

Three pairs of eyes clung to the Profound Yin Moon Water like leeches, unable to look away, each wearing a grin.

Five-Colored Meteor Essence wasn’t hard to find at the Hengluo Commerce Guild. After Zong Ao left, they had quickly retrieved the treasure and were now discussing how to divide it and whether to report it to the main star.

The three were excited yet at a loss.

Seeing Yang Kai arrive, they made no attempt to hide it and left the Profound Yin Moon Water out. Halika rose and asked, “Young brother, how is Lady Xue?”

“So-so—still unconscious.” Yang Kai answered casually.

Their faces darkened.

“But Senior Zong Ao promised to diagnose her and has found a cure.” Yang Kai added offhand.

“Truly?” Halika brightened, Lin Mufeng visibly relaxed, and the middle-aged woman clapped her full bosom, her face improving greatly.

“Young brother, if the Commerce Guild can help with anything, speak up. Lady Xue’s accident happened on Rainfall Star; we owe assistance.” Halika said earnestly.

“I came to ask for your help.” Yang Kai smiled slightly.
