## Chapter 2500 — Advancement to the Emperor Realm

This power that emerged from the Xuan Realm Pearl was extremely similar to the Great Might of Heaven and Earth; the two could almost be said to share the same origin.

“Another strand of heaven and earth might?” Wu Kuang cried out in shock.

“How can this brat control the Great Might of Heaven and Earth? Where did he get it from?” Duan Hongchen was also astonished.

Not to mention Yang Kai, who hadn’t even advanced to the Emperor Realm yet—even those who had cultivated as Emperors for many years could not wield such power. Only a Great Emperor could comprehend the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, and only a Great Emperor was qualified to command even a sliver of it.

The Third Stage of the Emperor Realm was already the pinnacle of the Martial Dao. Even the cultivation of the Great Emperors did not surpass this boundary, but the difference between them and ordinary Third Stage Emperors lay in their understanding of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth.

To comprehend the Great Might of Heaven and Earth was to be qualified to become a Great Emperor, to stand above ordinary Third Stage Emperors.

Yet now, Yang Kai had actually wielded a strand of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth. Although this power was somewhat inferior to the one formed by the world itself—like the difference between father and son—it was undoubtedly the true Great Might of Heaven and Earth.

Both Great Emperors were deeply shocked, even more so than when they saw the Golden Sacred Dragon’s Origin Power and the Mountain and River Bell.

“Is it because of that pearl?”

Wu Kuang stared intently at the Xuan Realm Pearl, looking thoughtful. If not for concerns about the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, he would have unleashed his Divine Sense to investigate it thoroughly. But precisely because of those concerns, he had no idea what kind of Secret Treasure the Xuan Realm Pearl truly was.

If Wu Kuang could notice this problem, so could Duan Hongchen. He frowned deeply at the Xuan Realm Pearl, comparing it to the many famous Secret Treasures in his memory, but found that none matched.

It seemed he had never seen this Secret Treasure before.

This was truly strange. Duan Hongchen had lived for who knows how many tens of thousands of years. For there to be a famous Secret Treasure in the Star Realm that he didn’t know about was basically impossible.

Yet now, one had appeared right before his eyes.

But regardless of what this pearl was, Yang Kai’s ability to wield the Great Might of Heaven and Earth was definitely related to it!

Could it be another Primordial Era artifact? The thought startled Duan Hongchen, but he quickly dismissed it. Primordial Era artifacts were easy to recognize—the aura from the ancient times was impossible to hide. The Mountain and River Bell was just such an example.

The Xuan Realm Pearl contained a world of its own. Since it was a small world, it naturally possessed its own Great Might of Heaven and Earth. As the master of the Xuan Realm Pearl, Yang Kai was connected to it in mind and spirit, so he could draw out its might to resist this overwhelming tribulation.

However, the Xuan Realm Pearl was merely a small world unto itself, and naturally, it could not compare to the true world outside.

The difference in strength between the two strands of heaven and earth might was obvious at a glance.

Rumble...

The Great Might of Heaven and Earth from the Xuan Realm Pearl surged forward, rising to meet the true Great Might of Heaven and Earth, and soon the two collided.

Yang Kai watched nervously. If even this couldn’t withstand the assault, he would have no choice but to use his final trump card—unsealing his Demonic Qi and using the body of an Ancient Great Demon to face this tribulation.

But if he did that, Yang Kai wasn’t sure if he could reseal the Demonic Qi afterward. It had been several years since he last unsealed it. The Firmament Tree planted in the Small Xuan Realm had accumulated quite a bit of sealing power. In theory, it should be enough—after all, a year of growth in the medicine garden equaled a hundred years outside.

Hundreds of years’ worth of sealing power—could it really not suppress the rampaging Demonic Qi?

But there was a drawback: every time the seal was broken, it took even more sealing power to suppress the Demonic Qi again. Yang Kai had discovered this last time, so unless it was absolutely necessary, he would not use this trump card.

Who knew if one day the Firmament Tree’s sealing power would be insufficient, and he would fail to reseal the ancient Demonic Qi, falling into demonization and losing his own consciousness? Yang Kai had never underestimated the pure Demonic Qi of the Ancient Great Demon.

Heaven and earth trembled, the universe shattered.

Even this bizarre space seemed on the verge of collapse.

Wu Kuang and Duan Hongchen’s expressions changed dramatically.

The collision of the two strands of heaven and earth might sent out shockwaves beyond imagination, as if two worlds had crashed together, with seas turning to mulberry fields in an instant.

Visibly, the Great Might of Heaven and Earth born from the Small Xuan Realm gradually dissipated, clearly no match for the true power of the world.

Yet as it faded, Yang Kai distinctly felt the pressure on him lessen, and this discovery made him break into a smile.

When the Great Might of Heaven and Earth from the Xuan Realm Pearl finally vanished, Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn. He rapidly formed hand seals, desperately stirring his own Origin Qi, opening his Sea of Consciousness wide, and letting his Divine Soul power surge outward like a tide.

The Mountain and River Bell shone brilliantly, its aura of suppressing heaven and earth growing even stronger.

The remaining Great Might of Heaven and Earth seemed to struggle, but under Yang Kai’s desperate efforts, it was directly suppressed by the Mountain and River Bell.

With a thunderous boom, the Mountain and River Bell landed not far in front of Yang Kai, its light gradually fading as the remaining Great Might of Heaven and Earth was sealed within, unable to move.

The aftershocks gradually faded, and everything returned to calm.

At the same time, the weakened Yang Kai felt a strange sensation. With a wave of his hand, he scattered countless Source Crystals, which exploded into dust and transformed into pure Spiritual Qi.

Yang Kai’s body suddenly became like a bottomless pit, madly devouring the surrounding Spiritual Qi.

His weak aura climbed rapidly, soon reaching the peak of the Dao Origin Realm, but it didn’t stop there and continued to rise.

At a certain moment, Yang Kai suddenly heard a cracking sound from within his body. Instantly, he felt light all over, as if he had been thoroughly cleansed. His Origin Qi underwent a wondrous transformation, and even his overdrawn Sea of Consciousness was instantly replenished.

The entire world seemed completely different from before.

Yang Kai felt as if he had been reborn. Every inch of his flesh pulsed with terrifying power.

Emperor Intent spread out, clear and tangible, thick as substance.

Emperor Realm!

From the time he began cultivating at thirteen to becoming an Emperor today, decades had passed. He had survived countless life-and-death tribulations. Though the true peak was still far away, today Yang Kai finally possessed the qualifications to strive for it.

Overcome with emotion, he let out a long howl, soaring straight into the sky.

“He actually... succeeded!” Wu Kuang exclaimed in shock.

“Count yourself lucky you had foresight, or you’d have to slit your own throat in front of me right now.” Duan Hongchen couldn’t help but purse his lips, his face full of regret. Although he had proposed a wager earlier, Wu Kuang had been too cautious to accept. If he had, there would have been quite a show.

“How could this possibly have succeeded!” Wu Kuang’s face was ashen, disbelief written all over it.

As the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, the number one person in the Star Realm throughout history, he believed no one could surpass him in any aspect!

Yet today, someone had done it.

Even if it was just the commotion of advancing to the Emperor Realm.

When he himself became an Emperor, it had been difficult, but nothing compared to the terror of what he saw today.

This brat had faced such tribulation in his advancement. One could imagine how bright his future would be. Duan Hongchen had said before that his achievements would surpass his own—he had thought it was just a joke, but now it seemed it might really come true.

With so many rare treasures and such outstanding talent and strength, how could someone like him not achieve greatness in the future?

Wu Kuang couldn’t help but lose focus. For the first time in his life, he felt inferior to someone else.

Suddenly, his expression changed drastically. He turned to Duan Hongchen and shouted, “You old bastard, you dare play dirty! Shameless!”

Who knew what Duan Hongchen had secretly done to him, but Wu Kuang instantly flew into a rage.

Duan Hongchen burst into hearty laughter. “It seems you're truly worried about that boy! You didn’t even notice the trick I played on you. But now that you’ve realized, it’s already too late.”

As he spoke, Duan Hongchen urged his Emperor Yuan, and the Divine Tree Baiyi’s Origin that had always enveloped him suddenly turned blood-red.

The origin power of the Divine Tree Baiyi was of the wood element and had always been a lush green, but now, for some reason, it had become blood-red, exuding a strange aura.

“You dare to devour the Qi and blood I painstakingly gathered!” Wu Kuang shouted. He looked at Duan Hongchen in disbelief. “If you forcefully use the Baiyi Origin like this, you’ll destroy it. How will you explain it to Iron Blood then?”

Duan Hongchen replied solemnly, “Iron Blood knows I won’t be returning. He left this Divine Wood Origin to me to dispose of as I wish. Without all this Qi and blood, let’s see how you’ll rebuild your body. With just your ancient bones that have slept for tens of thousands of years, don’t even think about making any waves!”

“Insolence! You all want this Lord dead, but this Lord will live just to spite you!” Wu Kuang howled hysterically.

Duan Hongchen sneered, “You’re powerless to change anything. Just accept your death. I’ll accompany you on the Yellow Springs Road, so you won’t be lonely!”

As he finished speaking, Duan Hongchen moved, charging straight at Wu Kuang. In midair, his Emperor Yuan surged violently, radiating an extremely unsettling aura.

“Self-Destruction?” Wu Kuang’s eyes bulged, and for the first time in his life, he felt true fear. Even when he was besieged by the other Emperors back then, he had never been so terrified. But seeing Duan Hongchen charge at him with such resolve, he couldn’t help but panic.

Although Duan Hongchen was now only at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, he still possessed the foundation of a Great Emperor. If he truly self-destructed, Wu Kuang knew he would never survive it—when that moment came, he would be dragged down to the Yellow Springs together with him.

“You dare force this Lord to such lengths! Duan Hongchen, don’t think you’ll have it easy either!” Wu Kuang shouted, suddenly forming hand seals. The Primordial Gale between them instantly became violent and dangerous.

Duan Hongchen’s face darkened. He understood that Wu Kuang had been driven to desperation and was about to detonate the Primordial Gale.

The Primordial Gale was a wind-element Origin. If it exploded, its power would be unimaginable.

What a pity. Who knows if that boy Yang Kai will survive the aftermath, but now that the arrow was nocked, there was no turning back. Duan Hongchen could only hope that fate would favor Yang Kai, and that fortune would protect him.
