## Chapter 56 — The Probe

Upon witnessing this scene, the bound Hu Mei’er immediately cried out, “Sister, you’re being unfair!”

But her shouts could not carry beyond the room. Frustrated and drenched in fragrant sweat, she was utterly helpless. Such deceit! With her sister’s strength, toying with a mere Body Tempering Realm martial artist was as effortless as breathing.

If this were a normal exchange, Hu Mei’er believed Yang Kai would not reveal any embarrassing flaws. Yet if her sister had secretly employed some trick, then all bets were off.

Inside the room, Hu Jiao’er suddenly rose again, stepping slowly toward the fragrant bed. She glanced back with a smile and said, “Wait a moment, I’ll fetch something for you.”

“All right.” Yang Kai’s brow furrowed slightly. He sensed something amiss but could not pinpoint what it was.

Approaching the bed, Hu Jiao’er bent down and half-kneeling, began searching. Her thin garment did nothing to conceal her myriad charms. The fabric clung tightly to her round, firm hips, displaying an unparalleled allure.

Yang Kai’s heartbeat quickened considerably, and a fire seemed to ignite in his throat.

For quite some time, Hu Jiao’er maintained this enticing posture. Suddenly, a soft cry escaped her lips.

“What is it?” Yang Kai’s expression shifted as he hurried forward.

At that moment, Hu Jiao’er stepped back from the bed, stumbled, and fell directly into Yang Kai’s arms, clutching him tightly.

Their feet bumped awkwardly, and somehow, without realizing it, they both tumbled onto the bed.

Hu Jiao’er was on top, Yang Kai beneath. The warmth of her delicate body pressed close, and his throat grew even drier. Gazing at her beautiful face and lips, so near and so inviting, Yang Kai forced down the rising desire and asked, “What’s wrong?”

“There’s a bug!” Hu Jiao’er played her part fully, her acting quite convincing. Her small hands gripped Yang Kai’s clothes tightly, her expression that of a startled bird.

Yang Kai chuckled softly, “Where is it?”

“There...” Following her pointed finger, Yang Kai spotted a small insect crawling slowly. He thought to himself how amusing women could be. Even as martial artists, such a tiny bug could frighten them so. He reached out, crushed it with a pinch, then patted her delicate shoulder. “It’s gone now. I’ve killed it.”

“There must be more...” Hu Jiao’er pressed her advantage, turning her head to look around. Strands of her silky hair brushed against Yang Kai’s cheek and lips, stirring his recently calmed heart once more.

“There aren’t any more.” Yang Kai felt this was becoming a problem. If someone were to walk in now and see them like this, no amount of water from the Three Rivers and Five Lakes could wash away the scandal.

“Really none?” Hu Jiao’er’s eyes flickered with surprise. She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to remain so composed, resisting the temptation to take advantage of her.

Had he truly made a move, he would surely have ended up maimed.

Though inwardly unsettled, Hu Jiao’er ceased her insistence and obediently climbed off Yang Kai.

Yang Kai also sat up, somewhat embarrassed, and looked toward Hu Mei’er, who was also flushed and limping as she settled beside him.

“What happened to your foot?” Yang Kai asked.

“I think I sprained it when I fell just now.” Hu Jiao’er tried another tactic, thinking to sacrifice herself today to pry out his heart and see whether it was black or red.

Yang Kai crouched down and examined her foot. Her ankle was indeed swollen and red — clearly a genuine injury.

But it was not truly an accident. To test Yang Kai, Hu Jiao’er had paid a heavy price this time.

Yang Kai did not shy away. After all, Hu Mei’er was not one to fuss over formalities. She had just tempted him so openly; now he held her foot—what harm was there?

“Don’t move!” Yang Kai warned, then reached into his bosom and produced a small bottle.

It was a jar of Lingxiao Pavilion’s Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment. He paused for a moment, as if pondering something. After a while, he opened the bottle, poured some ointment into his palm, and carefully applied it to the swollen area on Hu Jiao’er’s ankle.

A faint flow of True Yang Yuan Qi circulated, aiding the medicine’s effect.

Hu Jiao’er shivered involuntarily, thinking she had truly lost out this time! For so many years, her pure and unblemished body had never been touched by anyone. Today, just to wager with her little sister, she had been held and touched. Yet she could neither protest nor demand recompense.

Though feeling wronged in her heart, her body responded differently.

The large hand gently massaged her ankle with care and seriousness. The rough calluses rubbed against her tender skin, sending waves of tingling sensation.

His earnest demeanor seemed far beyond his years, exuding a calm maturity.

As Yang Kai’s hands moved, Hu Jiao’er’s wandering thoughts were gradually interrupted. Strange sensations surged through her body, unsettling her mind. Her heart pounded wildly, and a heat blossomed in her lower abdomen, darting like lightning. She instinctively clamped her legs tightly, fearing the heat would escape otherwise.

“Yang Kai...” A strange tone escaped Hu Jiao’er’s lips. At that moment, she was so embarrassed she wished the earth would swallow her whole, never imagining she would one day utter such a sound.

“Hm?” Yang Kai looked up, meeting Hu Jiao’er’s watery eyes fixed on him. Her face had lost all color except for a deep flush.

“Do you want to... do something else?” Hu Jiao’er bit her ruby lips, making one last attempt.

If Yang Kai agreed, she could abandon all these feelings and withdraw completely, leaving him no peace.

Would he agree? Hu Jiao’er was torn, hoping for release yet also wanting him to refuse, proving that neither she nor her little sister had been mistaken. This tension left her heart in turmoil.

Hu Mei’er, still bound, was equally anxious. She ceased her futile cries and stared intently at Yang Kai, uncertain what answer he would give.

Yang Kai looked steadily at Hu Jiao’er, as if about to move. Her heart leapt to her throat, fearing he would utter a word of consent.

Suddenly, Yang Kai smiled faintly, deliberately putting away the ointment with utmost solemnity, tucking it back into his bosom.

“Miss,” Yang Kai murmured thoughtfully.

“Hm?” Hu Jiao’er was so nervous she barely noticed the change in his form of address.

“The Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment I used to heal your injury just now is one of my most treasured possessions. Though not valuable in price, it is a testament to the warmth of human kindness I have felt over these years.”

“What do you mean?” Hu Jiao’er was stunned. She had just asked if he wanted to do something else, and now he spoke of this? Was there some hidden meaning?

Yang Kai straightened, looking down at Hu Jiao’er from above. “I mean to tell you that since I used this precious ointment to heal you, I hope you will not mind my earlier indiscretion. Let this farce end here.”
