## Chapter 1265 — Daiyuan Comes to Visit

Hearing Yang Kai ask like that, Wu Yi pursed her lips into a smile and looked at him with an ambiguous gleam. "I don't know,"
she said, "since she arrived she hasn't mixed much with others — she doesn't seem to like talking. I visited her a few times, but she never said much; though she does always inquire after you, teehee..."

She had formed the same misunderstanding as Wei Guchang.

Yang Kai was too lazy to explain. Wearing a troubled expression, he thought for a moment and said, "Fine, I'll go see her. If it's nothing important, she wouldn't have come all the way here for no reason."

Saying that, he strode straight out.

He had wanted to pry a bit of information from Wu Yi and Yang Yan first so he'd be prepared, but he hadn't expected that although she'd been here a month, she still hadn't revealed her purpose in coming.

Yang Kai felt a headache coming on. Daiyuan didn't seem like someone who came merely to take a look. Since she had come, she must have a request. If it were truly a casual meeting, he could have refused outright, but this woman had close ties with Wei Guchang and Xuan'er, and she had shared time with him in the Flowing Flame Sandland. Refusing too curtly would be awkward for appearances.

He could only find out exactly what she wanted before deciding what to do.

After a short while, Yang Kai arrived at another exquisite pavilion some a hundred zhang away. He had already probed with his Divine Sense and knew Daiyuan lived inside; at the moment her aura was steady, as if she were sitting in cultivation.

Yang Kai could only call out loudly, "Miss Daiyuan, Yang Kai has arrived."

The steady aura wavered for a moment, and then Daiyuan's surprised voice came from within the pavilion: "Junior Brother Yang, please enter. Daiyuan is in the middle of circulating her arts and cannot greet you at once, please forgive me — wait a moment; I'll come down as soon as I finish."

Yang Kai gave a slight nod and strode in.

The pavilions here were built in two stories. When Wu Yi and the others constructed them they had considered that residents might need to receive guests; thus the first floor was generally for entertaining others, while the second floor was where the pavilion's owner cultivated.

Yang Kai entered the first floor, found a chair, and sat down without ceremony—after all, this was his turf. Strictly speaking, Daiyuan was the guest; he needn't make a fuss.

After waiting quietly for a while, footsteps sounded on the stairs. Daiyuan descended from above in a pale-blue court dress, a faint smile on her face.

The gown outlined her flawless figure without mercy — ample in front, shapely behind. Her waist was slim and lithe. Yang Kai looked at her with a flash of barely concealed regret in his eyes. Were it not for that innate defect, she would have been a true beauty; that shortcoming, however, greatly diminished her charm.

The oddness in Yang Kai's gaze was fleeting, but Daiyuan caught it. This woman was gentle and perceptive; she knew what he was lamenting. Her heart was as clear as a mirror, but her face remained composed. She offered a curt apology and sat on the chair right beside Yang Kai. With a graceful sweep of her dainty jade hand, a ring on her finger flashed with brilliance, and a plate of exquisite spirit fruit appeared on the table.

"These are Purple Mist Fruits I picked from Purple Mist Mountain of Liuli Gate. Apart from our Liuli Gate, nowhere else on Dark Star bears such spirit fruit. They can't compare to the Spiritual Fruits and Medicines in the Flowing Flame Sandland, but they help greatly in refining Saint Yuan. Junior Brother Yang, if you don't mind, have a taste," Daiyuan chirped with expectation.

Yang Kai grinned broadly. "Miss Daiyuan is too kind; I won't be polite."

Though inwardly he grumbled, knowing she had definitely come with a purpose, he picked up a small purple fruit and eyed it briefly.

He had never heard of the Purple Mist Fruit before, but its purple aura flowed and its scent was intoxicating; within Liuli Gate it was clearly not something ordinary people could eat. Since Daiyuan had specially brought them, he naturally sampled one.

Tossing the small purple fruit into his mouth and chewing a little, a sweetness immediately filled his mouth, lifting his brows in surprise.

The taste was unexpectedly superb; that sweetness seemed to rush straight into the mind, leaving one utterly refreshed.

After swallowing the Purple Mist Fruit, Yang Kai felt a warm current spread from his abdomen through his limbs and bones, purifying his Saint Yuan. The effect was slight but genuine.

Yang Kai said nothing, but took another Purple Mist Fruit and ate it; after three in succession he finally praised them.

Daiyuan was greatly pleased to see his expression.

The two then chatted about what had happened since they parted in the Flowing Flame Sandland, and for a time the conversation proved most agreeable.

What vexed Yang Kai was that Daiyuan seemed to have come only to chat, never mentioning the purpose of her visit. Whatever he said, she had something to reply; the scene grew warm and harmonious, like two old friends catching up after years apart, her occasional clear laughter making the time fly.

Two hours later Yang Kai could no longer restrain himself. He cleared his throat and said, "Miss Daiyuan, you came to Dragon Lair Mountain — is there some important matter? If you want me to help, please be frank. Within my power, I will not refuse."

He did not promise too much: if it wasn't serious he wouldn't waste time and would help where he could, but if she asked him to undertake something dangerous, he would refuse.

He had no wish to make too many enemies on Dark Star; even Lu Ye from Liu Yun Valley alone was trouble enough.

He had no idea why that Lu Ye kept targeting him, leaving Yang Kai puzzled. They had once fought in the Third Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland; although Yang Kai had severed one of his arms with the Space Blade, someone like that not dying made sleep difficult.

On Yang Kai's question, Daiyuan fell silent, biting her red lips and appearing hesitant, as if about to say something then stopping.

Yang Kai did not press her, merely sat quietly while remaining on high alert. Her hesitation suggested the matter she wanted his help with was no small thing.

He was already thinking of what excuse to use to refuse her.

At that moment Daiyuan suddenly lifted her head, her delicate brow arched, her star-bright eyes fixed on Yang Kai as she spoke a line that struck him like thunder: "Junior Brother Yang, you're an Origin-Grade alchemist, aren't you?"

Yang Kai's eyelids narrowed; a sliver of light flashed in his eyes, and then he laughed. "Miss Daiyuan, why would you say that?"

He believed no one on Dark Star knew he was an Origin-Grade alchemist. Even Yang Yan and Wu Yi were unaware; when he'd mentioned it to them before they had thought he was joking.

How did this Daiyuan know?

An Origin-Grade artificer here would already be enough to arouse envy. If news of an Origin-Grade alchemist leaked out, who knew what uproar it might cause, especially given the layered formations and Qian Tong's protection that kept Dragon Lair Mountain safe until now.

"You needn't deny it. If I say so, I have my reasons," Daiyuan smiled faintly, tucked a stray lock behind her ear, and met his gaze without flinching. "But rest assured, other than me no one knows. If you are worried, you can kill me to silence me. I didn't tell anyone at Liuli Gate that I would come here, and I concealed my movements all the way. Even if I died here, except for a few people nearby no one would know. You needn't fear Liuli Gate seeking revenge."

Killing her to silence her—Yang Kai knew he couldn't bring himself to do that. If she were an enemy he wouldn't hesitate, but he had no enmity with her. He shouldn't murder someone simply because she suspected he was an Origin-Grade alchemist.

Moreover, she had spoken to such lengths, even proposing being killed to silence her — a sign of sincerity.

Yang Kai's expression grew impassive. After pondering a long while, he frowned and asked, "How did you find out?"

"Are you truly so?" For a moment a flash of delight burst in Daiyuan's usually calm eyes; she stared at Yang Kai with an urgency that refused to be hidden.

Yang Kai was taken aback, then let out a wry laugh and secretly ground his teeth before clasping his fists. “Miss, you’re truly devious — I, Yang Kai, have learned my lesson!”

By now he could see through it: Daiyuan's earlier certainty had been a ploy to test him. He had assumed she truly knew, but she might only have suspected.

He guessed if he had denied it firmly, the matter would have dropped.

Daiyuan gave an embarrassed smile, rose, and offered a graceful bow to Yang Kai. "Junior Brother Yang, forgive me. I had to resort to this trick because I couldn't be certain. If you're angry, feel free to scold me."

"There's no need for that," Yang Kai shook his head. He knew she meant to ease her embarrassment. Besides, it had been his own momentary carelessness that led him into her trap — how could he scold her?

"Thank you, Junior Brother Yang, for your magnanimity," Daiyuan said, and sat down again with composed grace.

"But how did you know I was an Origin-Grade alchemist?" Yang Kai asked, curious.

"I only knew you were an alchemist; I couldn't tell the exact rank," Daiyuan said with a downcast smile, seeming in good spirits.

"That's still strange enough," Yang Kai said, watching her, hoping she would explain.

"It's simple. Due to certain peculiar reasons I'm very sensitive to medicinal aromas and pills. A variety of pill fragrances always linger about you, so I knew you were an alchemist. Even now there's a pill scent on you. If I'm not mistaken, you must have refined Origin Condensing Pills and Blood Lily Pills, and that was at least half a year ago."

Yang Kai was dumbfounded in an instant!
