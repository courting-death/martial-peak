## Chapter 2429 — Shattered Star Sea Opens

In the arena, Yang Kai was like a fierce tiger, his aura soaring like a rainbow. With just two punches, he had already destroyed Feng Xi's defensive Secret Treasure. In contrast, Feng Xi staggered, blood spurting from his mouth, looking utterly miserable.

As Feng Xi had yet to steady himself, Yang Kai rushed forward and brought down a third punch.

Feng Xi's eyes widened in shock, a wave of deathly fear washing over him. His face turned deathly pale.

He realized he had underestimated Yang Kai's strength. The moment Yang Kai made his move, his attacks were relentless, leaving Feng Xi with no chance to defend. If he had known, he would have used his trump card from the start. He had thought there was no real gap in strength between them, and even if there was, he believed he would be the one suppressing Yang Kai. Yang Kai couldn't possibly be his match. But now, he saw how naive he had been.

Watching that fist come down, Feng Xi even held his breath, his pupils shrinking to the size of a needlepoint.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s expression changed, as if he had been ambushed. The fist he was about to throw abruptly halted, and in the next instant, his figure flickered back, retreating gracefully. With a grave look, he lowered his gaze to the back of his own hand.

The suffocating aura of death suddenly receded, but Feng Xi let out a startled cry and instinctively glanced at his own arm. In the next instant, realization dawned on him, and his face lit up with wild joy.

On the other side, Yang Kai's eyes widened, his gaze fixed on the back of his hand.

Just as he was about to kill Feng Xi, a burning sensation suddenly came from the back of his hand. He thought he had been ambushed, so he immediately retreated, prioritizing his own safety.

For someone to ambush him without him noticing, it had to be an Emperor Realm expert.

What puzzled him was that even Bing Yun seemed not to have noticed anything.

But after retreating and checking, Yang Kai realized things weren't as he thought. The back of his hand was still burning hot, but there were no signs of an attack, and the heat only intensified, as if he had plunged his hand into molten lava.

While he was still suspicious and confused, not knowing what was happening, Feng Xi suddenly cried out in pain from across the arena.

Yang Kai looked up and saw Feng Xi clutching a spot on his arm, gritting his teeth and growling.

Not only him; cries of surprise also rang out from the surrounding spectator stands.

What's going on? Yang Kai's expression was grave and confused. He glanced toward the Ice Heart Valley crowd and saw Zi Yu also clutching her arm, sweat pouring down her forehead.

But Yang Kai keenly noticed that only a dozen or so young people were affected, both men and women, all Dao Origin Realm cultivators.

The sudden changes on both the arena and the stands shocked the Emperor Realm experts, who had no idea what was happening to these rising stars. Bing Yun stopped her entanglement with Feng Xuan and looked at Yang Kai with concern.

An Ruoyun, Sun Yunxiu, and the others gathered around Zi Yu, asking what was wrong.

Before they could get an answer, specks of starlight began to drift from the backs of the affected young people's hands and arms, like countless fireflies gathering and slowly rising into the air, creating a beautiful spectacle.

"This is..." Bing Yun's beautiful eyes narrowed, as if she suddenly understood something.

The experts from the major sects of the Northern Territory trembled with excitement, pointing at the starlight, their lips quivering.

Suddenly, the burning sensation on the back of Yang Kai's hand vanished. When he looked again, he found a pentagonal mark had appeared there.

A flash of insight struck him, and he called out, "Star Seal!"

This five-pointed star mark was clearly a Star Seal from the Shattered Star Sea, a trophy he had obtained in the Four Seasons Land.

Back then, he had taken a spot from Qingyang Shrine to enter the Four Seasons Land and obtained a total of seven Star Seals, handing six to Qingyang Shrine and keeping one five-pointed Star Seal for himself.

So much time had passed, and the Star Seal had remained dormant. Yang Kai had almost forgotten about it.

He never expected a strange phenomenon to occur at the critical moment of his life-and-death battle with Feng Xi.

The Star Seal was the key to entering the Shattered Star Sea. Only those who possessed a Star Seal were qualified to enter. The Shattered Star Sea was said to be the place where the greatest expert of the Star Realm, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, had fallen. Some even said his legacy was hidden there, drawing countless experts to pursue it.

Unfortunately, every time the Shattered Star Sea opened, Emperor Realm experts could not enter. Only cultivators below the Emperor Realm could go in.

The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had been dead for tens of thousands of years. Over these millennia, the four territories of the Star Realm and countless sects had sent their best disciples into the Shattered Star Sea, hoping to find his legacy and uncover the secret of his unrivaled power, but none had succeeded.

The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor's secrets seemed to have been buried in the Shattered Star Sea with his death.

If it were only this temptation, perhaps not so many cultivators would be interested. After all, there was only one Heaven Devouring Great Emperor and only one legacy. How easy could it be to find?

The key was that the Shattered Star Sea contained countless remnants of Stellar Origins. Any cultivator who obtained one could better comprehend the laws of heaven and earth and advance to the Emperor Realm more quickly.

It was said that out of every ten Emperor Realm experts in the Star Realm, seven had entered the Shattered Star Sea. This showed just how much this secret realm could boost a cultivator's strength.

For Dao Origin Realm cultivators, entering the Shattered Star Sea was like having one foot in the door to the Emperor Realm. This temptation was irresistible to any cultivator.

Many Emperor Realm experts had long sought the entrance to the Shattered Star Sea, hoping to enter and see it for themselves.

But when the Emperors besieged the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, the battle shattered the world, shaking the universe and turning everything upside down. The resulting Shattered Star Sea was hidden in a spatial crevice, making it impossible for experts to find the entrance.

In that battle, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor fell, but before dying, he took several Great Emperors with him.

In other words, the Shattered Star Sea might not only contain the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor's legacy, but also those of other Great Emperors! Even if one couldn't find their legacies, finding Secret Treasures or Spatial Rings discarded during their battles would be enough to ensure a cultivator never had to worry about cultivation resources again.

For all these reasons, the Shattered Star Sea attracted far more attention in the Star Realm than any other secret realm. It was a grand event for elite cultivators from all four territories.

Compared to it, the Four Seasons Land was utterly insignificant.

At this moment, the Star Seal suddenly emitted specks of starlight, and Yang Kai immediately understood what was happening.

"The Shattered Star Sea has opened!" A sudden cry rang out from the stands, and all the Emperor Realm experts stood up, their faces filled with excitement.

Yang Kai glared at Feng Xi, who stood not far away, and sneered, "Consider yourself lucky!"

If the Star Seal hadn't suddenly reacted, Feng Xi would have been seriously injured by now. Who knew if this guy was just lucky or had some great fortune, but he had escaped at the last moment.

Now that the Star Seal had responded, Yang Kai didn't dare act rashly, lest he make a mistake and lose his chance to enter the Shattered Star Sea.

Feng Xi also had a Star Seal, so he would clearly be entering the Shattered Star Sea as well.

On this arena, Yang Kai could only cripple Feng Xi, not kill him, to avoid sparking a war between Ice Heart Valley and Wenqing Sect. But once inside the Shattered Star Sea, he could eliminate future threats, so for now, he had no intention of troubling Feng Xi and simply stood quietly in place.

Feng Xi opened his mouth to retort, but when he met Yang Kai's icy gaze, he shrank back and swallowed his words.

After being utterly suppressed by Yang Kai in just a few short breaths, Feng Xi’s heart was already shadowed with fear. At this point, how could he dare provoke him any further?

On the arena, Yang Kai looked around and saw more than a dozen people on the stands, like him, with starlight shining from their arms. Most of them had an Emperor Realm expert by their side, giving them earnest advice.

They were undoubtedly the rising stars from the major sects of the Northern Territory, here to celebrate with their Emperor Realm elders.

Zi Yu was among them, with An Ruoyun, Sun Yunxiu, and others gathered around her. Sun Yunxiu was speaking rapidly, giving her instructions, while Zi Yu kept nodding and occasionally glanced at Yang Kai.

As their eyes met, Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

Zi Yu also possessed a Star Seal, so she would naturally enter the Shattered Star Sea as well. If they met inside, they could cooperate.

Yang Kai actually didn't know much about the Shattered Star Sea. Although he was a registered disciple of Qingyang Shrine and even had the highest-level Qingyang Gold Token, he hadn't received much guidance from the Emperor Realm experts of Qingyang Shrine, nor had he asked Wen Zishan or Gao Xueting about the Shattered Star Sea. In this regard, he was not as well-informed as disciples from major sects.

Once inside the Shattered Star Sea, if he met acquaintances, he could ask for information or explore on his own.

He actually knew quite a few people. He was familiar with most of the elite disciples of Qingyang Shrine, and many of the rising stars from the Southern Territory, having interacted with them in the Four Seasons Land. They would surely enter the Shattered Star Sea as well.

As Yang Kai pondered, Bing Yun's voice suddenly sounded in his ear, "The Shattered Star Sea is a great opportunity. Staying alive is what matters—return alive, and that's victory!"

Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

Bing Yun clearly wanted to say more, but there was no time. In the next moment, the starlight drifting from everyone's hands suddenly intensified, gathering above their heads. In the blink of an eye, the starlight formed a gate of light.
