## Chapter 2515 — I Have No Secret Treasure

The contest between martial artists of the same level was decided within three moves; it could only be described as a complete crushing.

“From that day on, this girl would come to the Rising Dragon Platform to fight every day. None of her opponents could last even the time it takes to burn a stick of incense against her. Her aura is fierce, her attacks ruthless, so everyone started calling her the Fiend Lady.”

“So this girl is that formidable?” The listener’s eyes lit up, exclaiming in surprise, and looked toward the stage with great interest.

“The Fiend Lady is indeed impressive, but Gu Shan isn’t weak either. I still think Gu Shan will win.” The one who spoke earlier looked unconvinced.

A third person gave a faint, cold laugh: “Gu Shan’s strength is solid, his foundation steady, and his Origin Qi is powerful, but he’s definitely not a match for the Fiend Lady.”

“What makes you say that?”

“Yeah, friend, aren’t you being a bit too arbitrary? Look at the fight on the stage—clearly, the Fiend Lady is being suppressed by Gu Shan. His ferocity is no less than hers.”

The third person glanced at the stage and said calmly, “Since I said so, I naturally have my reasons.”

“What insight do you have, friend? Let’s hear it.”

“Gu Shan’s growth has already reached its limit. Unless he breaks through to the Emperor Realm, he’ll never improve again in this life. But the Fiend Lady is different. She rarely fought before, possessing great strength but never using it. Every battle on the Rising Dragon Platform, she’s been growing. The girl today is far stronger than she was twenty days ago. Didn’t you notice? At first, she was completely at a disadvantage against Gu Shan, but now, she’s already able to find chances to counterattack while defending. If I’m not mistaken, she’s rapidly improving even in this fight. It won’t be long before she completely surpasses Gu Shan and knocks him off the platform.”

Hearing this, the other two thought carefully and realized it was true. They couldn’t help but admire him and said in unison, “You make sense, friend. In that case, maybe Gu Shan really isn’t her match.”

“But where did this girl come from? She looks just over twenty. Did she cultivate some kind of youth-preserving secret art?”

“Hmph, this girl’s aura is fierce, but she’s still immature. Clearly, she’s not that old.”

“Friend, you seem to know a lot about the Fiend Lady. Have you studied her?”

The man’s mouth twitched, and he said slowly, “Studied her? Yes, because... I was her first opponent!”

“Ah?” The other two stared at him in shock, not expecting he was the one who got beaten unconscious and coughing blood by the Fiend Lady in three moves. For a moment, it was quite awkward.

All around the stands, many people were discussing the Fiend Lady, wanting to know which Sect she came from. But her techniques were so wild and unpredictable that no one could guess.

What’s more, she hadn’t shown any sign of using a Secret Treasure, so it was impossible to deduce her origins from that either.

This subtle air of mystery only made people more interested in her.

Yang Kai looked at the stage with an indifferent expression, feeling a bit strange inside.

He hadn’t expected Zhang Ruoxi would come to fight on the stage, and in just twenty days, she’d made such a name for herself that all the martial artists in Ziyue City were wary of her.

The Zhang Ruoxi in his memory was nothing like this. She and the little girl on the stage seemed like two different people.

Suddenly, he felt as if he’d spent years raising a dormant beast. When it was in the cage, it was obedient, but once released, it could stir up a bloody storm.

The battle on the stage was raging fiercely.

The martial artist who was beaten unconscious by Zhang Ruoxi in three moves during her first fight might not have had high cultivation, but his eyesight was sharp.

Maybe he’d spent these twenty days enduring humiliation and studying Zhang Ruoxi, so he could clearly see her terrifying growth.

The fight between Gu Shan and her had gone from him having the upper hand, to being evenly matched, to now falling behind. The shift in offense and defense was obvious.

Neither of them had used a Secret Treasure. Zhang Ruoxi didn’t have one of her own—she only had the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress she wore close to her body, but she hadn’t activated its Imperial Treasure defensive power. As for Gu Shan, he was a famous figure in Ziyue City. Since the little girl wasn’t using a Secret Treasure, he’d be embarrassed to bring his out.

All kinds of secret arts clashed on the stage, energy surging, and the light barrier rippled with wave after wave.

Compared to Gu Shan’s steady and methodical style, Zhang Ruoxi’s moves were agile and unique. She seemed to have an extremely sharp combat instinct, displaying secret arts Yang Kai had never seen or even heard of. He didn’t know when or where she’d learned them.

The blood-red light around Gu Shan flickered and gradually dimmed, and even his aura became unstable.

A formidable foe! Gu Shan was secretly alarmed. He’d heard that this little girl had made life miserable for the martial artists of Ziyue City over the past twenty days, but only now, facing her himself, did he realize he’d underestimated her.

Especially her growth during battle—it was utterly terrifying.

In such a short time, she’d gone from being completely suppressed to controlling the fight. If this went on, she’d probably win soon.

Seeing the blood light on his body about to shatter, Gu Shan gritted his teeth, stepped back, flipped his palm, and a tiger-headed war hammer suddenly appeared in his hand. He shouted, “Girl, bring out your Secret Treasure! If you don’t, you won’t get another chance!”

He looked utterly determined, clearly ready to fight to the death.

Although he had no grudge against Zhang Ruoxi, he’d fought around Ziyue City for years and was known as the number one under the Emperor Realm. If he lost to a young girl today, how could he show his face here again?

He could only use his strongest trump card, his one and only killer move.

Still, he kindly told Zhang Ruoxi to bring out her Secret Treasure too, so he wouldn’t take unfair advantage in the fight.

Unexpectedly, Zhang Ruoxi just slowly shook her head and said calmly, “I don't have any Secret Treasure!”

“What?” Gu Shan’s eyes bulged, then he erupted in anger. “You should at least have some respect!”

He thought Zhang Ruoxi was mocking him. After all, what martial artist didn’t have a Secret Treasure? Especially someone at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—how could she not have one?

He didn’t know that Zhang Ruoxi was telling the truth.

The girl from the Zhang Family had improved so quickly that, although Yang Kai wanted to help her find a Secret Treasure, anything too low-grade couldn’t keep up with her cultivation, and anything too high-grade, she couldn’t refine.

Besides, Zhang Ruoxi had always cultivated peacefully in the Small Xuan Realm and never needed to use a Secret Treasure.

So from head to toe, she only had the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress.

But in Gu Shan’s eyes, this was an insult—she clearly wanted to fight him bare-handed.

Furious, Gu Shan shouted, “Don’t say I didn’t give you a chance! Since you’re so arrogant, don’t blame me for being ruthless!”

Zhang Ruoxi pressed her red lips together, saying nothing and not bothering to explain. She just looked solemn, ready to go all out at any moment.

With a roar, Gu Shan’s body suddenly swelled, turning into a round, fat giant. Then, all his Origin Qi surged wildly as he poured it into the tiger-headed war hammer.

The roar of a tiger shook the whole arena, as if the king of the jungle had leapt out of the forest, determined to defend its territory to the death.

“Still not bringing out your Secret Treasure?” Gu Shan shouted again, unleashing the power of his Secret Treasure.

Zhang Ruoxi slowly shook her head.

“You asked for this!” Gu Shan roared in fury, exhaled sharply, and his fat body suddenly shrank as all his strength poured into the war hammer. The sky above the stage churned with wind and clouds, and the arena blazed with light. A lifelike giant tiger suddenly leapt out, carrying a world-destroying force as it pounced straight at Zhang Ruoxi.

Zhang Ruoxi seemed to sense the ferocity of this move. Her expression turned grave, and her ten fingers flicked out, forming sword-like strikes that whistled through the air as she met the overwhelming force head-on.

Boom, boom, boom…

Explosions rang out on the stage, dazzling light bursting forth so that no one could see what was happening. All they knew was that the fight had reached a life-and-death climax.

The massive energy shockwaves twisted and deformed the stage’s protective barrier. In the stands, the crowd gasped in shock at Gu Shan’s devastating attack, while secretly wondering how the Fiend Lady would counter it—or if she’d be obliterated by it.

Countless eyes stared wide at the stage.

After a long time, the terrifying energy finally dissipated, the light faded, and the scene on the stage came into view.

“Huh… why is only Gu Shan there?”

“Where’s the Fiend Lady? Where did she go?”

“Maybe she’s hiding somewhere, waiting to ambush Gu Shan!”

“The stage is so small—how could she hide?”

“Look, there are pieces of clothing on the ground. That’s what the Fiend Lady was wearing before.”

“Hiss… did the Fiend Lady die? Was she blasted to pieces?”

“Gu Shan won!”

In the stands, the noise surged like waves. Exclamations rang out—some excited, some regretful, some sympathetic, and some cursing…

The Fiend Lady, a comet-like expert who rose in Ziyue City, had shone for only twenty days before being blasted to pieces by Gu Shan. Many martial artists who secretly supported her cursed Gu Shan, saying he was too ruthless, that it was shameful to use such a Secret Treasure against a young girl.

Gu Shan stood on the stage, utterly exhausted. After unleashing that move, he had no strength left to fight.

He stood there with a strange expression, staring blankly at the pieces of clothing on the ground, feeling no joy at his victory.
