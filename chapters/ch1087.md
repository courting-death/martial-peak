## Chapter 1087 — Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion

Although Yang Kai was not old, he was no novice in affairs of courtesans; from a woman’s bearing, temperament, and words he could deduce what sort of person she was—whether coquettish, wanton, cool and refined, or hot-blooded.

The first time he saw this young married woman he assumed she was licentious; women with peach-blossom eyes were often unwilling to be lonely, and that kind of spring longing and seductive charm seemed the truest portrayal of their nature.

So for a long while at the beginning he avoided approaching her, afraid she would come to tease him.

But as he grew familiar with her, Yang Kai discovered that the woman called Luo Yao’s character was not what he had imagined; she was not like Bi Ya from the Purple Star, and beneath her alluring appearance there sat a hidden dignity and a steadier temperament.

This contrast between outward show and inner substance was extremely attractive; Yang Kai noticed many times a lanky man trailing behind Luo Yao, staring unblinking at her millstone-sized rear and willow-like waist.

Even Guiche, when dividing spoils, would deliberately allocate a bit more to her.

Ganji, a desperate soul who looked like he lived by fighting and vying for glory, often watched over her during battle.

It could be said that Luo Yao lived the most comfortably among that group.

"Young man, is there something you want to ask? If you want to ask, speak up — why be coy?" Luo Yao cleaned her face and smiled at Yang Kai, a sly glint hiding in that smile; she had obviously seen through his intention to get close to her.

"I just want to know what you all came here to find, and how you discovered that Space Array," Yang Kai said; seeing her take the initiative, he no longer held back.

The two of them were not far from the other three; if Guiche and the others truly wished to conceal anything, they would have spoken up to stop them.

Now the three were still sitting in meditation to recover, which meant they did not care. That emboldened Yang Kai considerably.

The days of hiding his strength and feigning weakness had finally paid off; this group no longer guarded themselves against him.

"To find a place to temper the body," Luo Yao answered frankly, a dreamy light appearing in her beautiful eyes. "As long as we can find it, our bodies will grow stronger. You’re an alchemist, but you’re also a warrior — you should know the benefits of a powerful body, right?"

Yang Kai nodded; of course he knew the advantages of a strengthened body. One could say he had more say in matters here than any of the four.

Without a powerful physique Yang Kai could not have stored so much Saint Yuan, nor could he have fought above his Stage; a firm body is a warrior’s foundation. No matter how profound a martial skill or how strange Saint Yuan might be, without a sturdy body to support it one remains a trivial actor.

"Where is such a place to temper the body?" Yang Kai asked with curiosity.

"Not sure," Luo Yao shook her head. "This is our first time here. You should have heard Guiche that day — no one’s entered this place for many years. We found our way in only by relying on ancestral texts and a map left by Ji Ping’s forebears."

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow at the mention of ancient texts.

"My ancestor came here before," the lanky man called Ji Ping, now fully recovered, walked to the lakeside and interjected. "He gained many benefits and left some clues. It was by following those clues that I found the Space Array hidden on that stretch of Meteorite Sea!"

Luo Yao chuckled lightly and looked at Yang Kai. "Young man, don’t think that Space Array is easy to locate — you came in through it yourself. That array was placed on a meteorite that drifts with the Meteorite Sea; its position constantly shifts, and if you miss the right period it’s very difficult to find again. Fortunately Ji Ping’s ancestor calculated some numbers and determined that the Meteorite Sea would pass through a certain range at certain times. Even so, we searched that huge area for nearly a year before pinpointing the target. Damn it, Diji and his group somehow got wind of it and chased us here, causing the deaths of many of our people."

"This grudge will be repaid!" Ji Ping snorted coldly, his gaunt face full of rancor as he glared at Yang Kai. "I’m telling you this because you’ve been honest lately. Cooperate and when we find that place there will be benefits for you too — you can temper your body and make it tougher."

"I understand; I’ll behave myself," Yang Kai replied solemnly.

Half an hour later everyone had fully recovered. Ji Ping studied the animal-skin map in his hands and guided the group onward; along the way they encountered no serious dangers.

That day Guiche, who led the front, suddenly stopped and gazed ahead with a grave expression.

Dozens of li away a yellow sandstorm billowed like a gigantic yellow dragon, reaching from earth to sky and covering a vast area; beyond it the land looked barren and lifeless.

A strange aura of danger radiated from that place. Guiche and the others spread their Divine Sense to probe it but found nothing; their Divine Sense could not penetrate the sand, as if something there blocked its intrusion.

Guiche turned his gaze to Yang Kai and signaled for him to go take a look.

Yang Kai said nothing, simply nodded, and advanced cautiously toward the region shrouded by the yellow sand.

Before long he reached the edge of the sandstorm, activated his power to guard his body, and stepped into the area.

The whirling sand struck like blades, mercilessly battering Yang Kai; even with Saint Yuan shielding him his whole body ached. He forced his eyes open to scan around but could only see within a foot of himself.

If Guiche and the others sensed the danger here, how could Yang Kai not? He had felt it immediately.

Releasing a Divine Sense imbued with spatial mysteries to break through the blockade, Yang Kai quickly scouted the area. The sand-covered region stretched for roughly thirty li in radius, within which strong currents of wind and earth energy surged.

Those two energies intertwined to weave an impenetrable net, which was why Guiche and the others could not pierce it with Divine Sense.

Yang Kai had thought this was a natural wonder, but when a murderous aura suddenly approached from a direction he realized otherwise.

That aura hid an evil life fluctuation — there were living creatures within the whirling sand.

He stood stock-still, eyes wide, staring toward the aura’s origin to see what was approaching.

The ground began to tremble and the murderous aura drew nearer; Yang Kai even smelled a nauseatingly foul stench that made one dizzy.

Nothing could be seen; the earth kept collapsing, sending more sand aloft before the gale, further blurring his sight.

Dimly he made out two immense pincers looming toward him. The pincers opened and closed as if they could shear space itself. Danger descended and Yang Kai hastily backed away; the instant he stepped out of the sandstorm he saw two crimson eyes staring at him through the dust.

An invisible pressure radiated from the sand; Yang Kai nearly found it hard to breathe.

The Wind-and-Thunder Wings unfurled behind him, and Yang Kai’s speed instantly surged to its maximum, spanning more than ten li in a flash. A purple pincer pierced through the sand and clamped down on the spot where he had been, severing the afterimage he had left behind.

Sweat poured from Yang Kai’s brow; without looking back he hurried toward Guiche and the others.

Soon he reached Guiche’s side, his face pale.

"What did you find?" Guiche demanded anxiously; Ganji, Luo Yao, and Ji Ping all stared intently at Yang Kai.

"A kind of fierce beast!" Yang Kai frowned. "It can manipulate wind and earth, has two large pincers, red eyes, and seems to have a high, erect tail. Its body was completely hidden in the sandstorm; even standing beside it you couldn’t see it — a very dangerous creature."

"Was its body surface purple?" Guiche’s expression changed as he urgently asked.

Yang Kai thought for a moment and nodded. "Yes — when I left its pincers shot out; they were purple. Do you know what it is?"

The other three looked expectantly at Guiche.

Guiche suddenly grinned and, with a touch of boasting, addressed the three: "Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion — anyone heard of it?"

Hearing that, the three brightened and showed signs of excitement.

Ganji exclaimed, "No way? Really the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion?"

"From what Yang Kai saw and my own judgment, it should be the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion for sure. We’ve hit the jackpot; haha — even if we can’t find that body-tempering place, one Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion makes this trip worthwhile," Guiche laughed heartily.

"But the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion is a Ninth-Tier demonic beast, equivalent to an expert of the Origin Returning Realm — can a few of us kill it?" Worry appeared in Luo Yao’s peach-blossom eyes.

"Shouldn’t be a problem," Ganji considered. "A demonic beast is still just a demonic beast. It has lived here for years and hasn’t seen much combat; if it only fights by instinct against us, it has no path but death."

"Indeed," Ji Ping agreed with a face full of eagerness.

"Is its body truly that valuable?" Yang Kai asked dubiously.

Guiche grinned. "Better than a Tenth-Tier beast. Other demonic beasts might only have an Inner Core worth anything; claws, teeth, and hide are of little use. But this Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion is different — its carapace, tail, and pincers can all be used to forge Secret Treasures of Origin-Grade quality. Its blood and venom are useful for refining pills, and its Inner Core can enhance a warrior’s power. In short, its whole body is treasure! The most precious is its Inner Core — because it’s a dual-attribute beast, having perfectly fused wind and earth. If a cultivator of wind or earth were to absorb it, they might glimpse the mysteries of another domain. How good is that?"

Yang Kai was moved as well.
