## Chapter 585 — We Are Three Sisters

"Why have all the heads of the Yang Family always been beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?" Yang Yinghao smiled enigmatically. "Because the master of the Yang Family enjoys special privileges—privileges only the Yang Family head can possess. Once you accept the position of family head, you will understand this secret."

Hearing this, Yang Kai showed no immediate reaction, but the other seven were breathing heavily, clearly having heard rumors of this secret but knowing nothing concrete.

"Uncle, is this simply an inducement by interest?" Yang Kai laughed.

"Even if it is," Yang Yinghao did not deny it. Yang Kai was not one to suffer losses. Simply put, he was a man motivated entirely by gains and would not act without seeing the benefits. He would not believe the secret the Yang Family holds could fail to move him.

"Can you reveal a little more?" Yang Kai's interest was piqued.

Yang Yinghao smiled slightly and parted his lips.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted; involuntarily, a hint of excitement flashed across his face.

The heads of the Seven Great Families scratched their heads awkwardly, eyes fixed on the silent exchange between Yang Kai and Yang Yinghao, yet none could discern what was said. Their impatience was palpable.

"Although I am tempted by this secret, Uncle, I truly do not wish to become a family head," Yang Kai frowned slightly and spoke seriously.

"The future of the Yang Family rests on you," Yang Yinghao’s expression was equally grave. "The Eight Great Families of Zhongdu have fought hard for generations, but to this day have only reached their current level. When the Cangyun Evil Land invaded, even the combined forces of the Eight Great Families could not repel them, and half of Zhongdu fell. This is a disgrace to us. But you, having returned to the Yang Family for just two years, have already created a situation more prosperous than any of the Eight Great Families. Your residence is an undisputed overlord in this world! I must say, you are more fit than anyone to lead the Yang Family. Otherwise, do you think those old gentlemen would entrust the family head position to immature youngsters? They are not trusting their own children—they are trusting you."

The seven all nodded gravely, looking at Yang Kai with expectancy, their previous disdain vanished.

Yang Kai smiled bitterly. When he opposed the Eight Great Families, he did not care about their desires or fate; now that they sought peace and had taken concrete steps, he felt somewhat guilty targeting them.

No one punches a smiling person; the Eight Great Families had indeed put great effort into resisting the Cangyun Evil Land.

"Uncle, I must disappoint your expectations," Yang Kai said sincerely. "But given the current situation, I will serve as the Yang Family head for a period. After these matters settle, the eldest or second brother can take over. My future is not with the Yang Family, nor Zhongdu; this is just a phase in my life, not the end."

Hope and yearning glimmered in Yang Kai's eyes. "You may not believe it, but I always feel that somewhere in this world, there exist stronger warriors, mightier sects, and grander families... Compared to them, the Eight Great Families might be nothing."

At the very least, Yang Kai knew of a Water Divine Hall that had trained an expert like Shui Ling.

The eight exchanged stunned looks, seemingly not quite grasping the implications in Yang Kai’s words.

What force in the world could be stronger than the Eight Great Families? Though the Cangyun Evil Land was formidable, it was formed by the convergence of six major fields.

"That is acceptable," Yang Yinghao mused softly and nodded. "You have greater ambitions, and of course, I will not hinder you. For now, you shall temporarily take the position of Yang Family head."

Yang Kai slightly bowed his head. "Temporarily is fine, but I will not attend the formal succession ceremony."

Yang Yinghao sighed and ceased to press the matter, conceding.

The simultaneous leadership changes in the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu shocked the world, especially those remaining in Zhongdu—almost everyone was stunned by the news.

The Seven Great Families held true succession ceremonies, formally passing on the family head titles. As for the Yang Family, they only issued a statement that in this critical moment of life and death, Yang Kai would temporarily act as family head.

Such a monumental event should have been the greatest celebration for each family, but with the many formidable warriors of Cangyun Evil Land lurking nearby, the Seven Great Families decided to hold the succession ceremonies for their younger generation concurrently. This was also to guard against any sudden moves by the Cangyun Evil Land.

Fortunately, the warriors of Cangyun Evil Land had remained relatively restrained during this period. Each family scrambled to arrange their grand ceremonies, busy to no end.

During this time, the defense tasks were entrusted to the many experts in Yang Kai’s residence.

Thanks to the protection by the forces in Yang Kai’s estate, all affairs proceeded smoothly.

Time passed, and three days later, Yang Yingfeng and his wife arrived at Yang Kai’s residence together.

Upon receiving the news, Yang Kai hurried out to greet them and paid respects to his elders.

Su Yan shyly followed alongside Yang Kai, blushing deeply as she greeted her uncle and aunt. Yang Yingfeng and Dong Suzhu, both seasoned individuals, immediately understood the relationship between her and Yang Kai from her bashful demeanor.

Dong Suzhu immediately started chatting familiarly with Su Yan, quite pleased with this ice-pure, beautiful future daughter-in-law who resembled an ice doll.

Fourth Master Yang silently gave Yang Kai an approving thumbs-up, full of envy.

"Aunt, actually he has another one," Su Yan suddenly whispered to Dong Suzhu.

"Another?" Dong Suzhu’s face brightened briefly before stiffening, saying to Su Yan, "Don’t worry, I will teach that rascal a lesson. That brat’s wings are growing, and now he’s playing the game of courting two at once."

She thought Su Yan was jealous and tattling.

"No, no," Su Yan quickly waved her hands. "It’s just that junior sister is rather shy and embarrassed to come out, and junior brother has never made their relationship clear. Letting her wait confusedly for life is improper... so..."

Dong Suzhu looked at Su Yan with some puzzlement, "Girl, you mean..."

"I want her to meet uncle and aunt too," Su Yan said earnestly.

Dong Suzhu was stunned to realize Su Yan’s generosity. After a moment, she said, "As long as you don’t mind, I am naturally happy to meet her and give her some clarity."

"Then I’ll bring her here," Su Yan smiled, then instantly vanished.

"Mother, where did Su Yan go?" Yang Kai, speaking with his father, noticed Su Yan had disappeared and asked.

"Hmph!" Dong Suzhu snorted mockingly. Yang Kai scratched his head, confused.

Soon Su Yan indeed brought Xia Ningshang along. The elder junior sister blushed, bowed politely to Fourth Master Yang and his wife, then obediently sat quietly aside, speaking only briefly when Dong Suzhu addressed her.

Dong Suzhu was especially pleased.

One was pure and beautiful, the other gentle and charming. What a blessing his son had earned in this life.

Fourth Master Yang was envious to death but scolded sternly, "Kai’er, you must treat these two girls well. Set a date soon and get this done."

Yang Kai chuckled, "No rush. We’re still young."

"You are young, but your parents are old," Fourth Master Yang said gruffly.

"Old what? Look at mother sitting there with Su Yan and junior sister—they look just like three sisters," Yang Kai said with a warm smile.

"Is that so?" Dong Suzhu loved hearing this.

"Of course," Yang Kai nodded seriously.

"Then from now on, we’re three sisters," Dong Suzhu said excitedly, pulling Su Yan and Xia Ningshang close.

Su Yan and the elder junior sister’s faces paled, staring shocked at Dong Suzhu.

Fourth Master Yang and Yang Kai’s faces darkened.

"Your aunt often loses her temper; you don’t need to mind her," Fourth Master Yang hurried to explain.

"Father, what brings you here today?" Yang Kai changed the subject to prevent Su Yan and junior sister from overthinking.

Yang Yingfeng said, "Your uncle wants you to return."

"Return to the Yang Family?"

"Yes."

Yang Kai frowned. "When?"

"As soon as possible."

"I see," Yang Kai nodded slightly. "Did uncle mention what for?"

"He didn’t say, only that it is an important matter requiring your personal return."

"Then... I’ll leave immediately." After a moment, Yang Kai said, "Father, mother, please wait a bit. I need to make arrangements first."

Entering his inner residence, he informed everyone about returning to the Yang Family. Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen were both away at their respective families preparing for their succession. Yang Kai could only entrust Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya to watch over the estate.

"Young Master, don’t blame this old servant for being blunt, but the Yang Family’s urgency might hide a conspiracy," Earth Demon suddenly warned.

"Unlikely," Yang Kai shook his head. "Since I have agreed to cooperate with them, they have no reason to go against me."

"That’s not so certain," Earth Demon smiled sinisterly. "The Eight Great Families are so used to dominance that being subordinated might breed resentment. Should anything happen to you, the power within the estate will collapse, and then the Eight Great Families stand to gain everything."

"We must be cautious," Meng Wuya solemnly reminded.

"If they truly intend that, they are shortsighted indeed, and I would have nothing to say," Yang Kai sneered.

The threat from the Cangyun Evil Land was not yet over, yet these families considered internal strife and carving up benefits at the expense of struggle. If that happened, the Eight Great Families would be better off not existing at all.

"Regardless, this old servant will accompany you," Earth Demon said gravely.

Yang Kai glanced at him and casually replied, "Fine."

He felt the Eight Great Families would not be so foolish. Choosing younger successors was serious, and before this calamity struck, at least they had done something right.

That gave Yang Kai hope there was still a chance to save them.

His participation in the coming battle was simply to absorb the divine sense of those Divine Roaming Realm experts who had perished. Now, the battle had yet to begin, and he needed to create the opportunity to merge the Eight Great Families with his estate. This was the best chance.
