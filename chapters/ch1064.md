## Chapter 1064 — Completely Satisfied

"I need your help gathering some medicinal herbs!" Yang Kai got straight to the point, not bothering with pleasantries.

"What kind of herbs do you need?" Halika smiled. "Medicinal herbs may be scarce elsewhere, but our Commerce Guild is never short on them."

Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman both nodded, indicating they would do their utmost to meet Yang Kai's request.

Yang Kai immediately listed the ingredients needed to refine the Leaving Fire Pill. Halika took the list, glanced over it, and said nonchalantly, "The herbs on this list aren't hard to find. Our branch has plenty in storage. Only the Dragon Turtle Spirit Fruit is a bit rare, but the rest are no problem. As for the fruit, you’ll just need to wait three to five months—we can transfer it from other medicine stars. It’s just a matter of time..."

"Three to five months is fine. Even longer is no issue, as long as it doesn’t drag on for a year or more," Yang Kai shook his head.

"Within four months, I guarantee I’ll have the Dragon Turtle Spirit Fruit," Halika promised, patting his chest.

Some herbs require specific environments to grow. Rainfall Star may be a cultivation star, but it doesn’t have the right conditions for the Dragon Turtle Spirit Fruit. However, a nearby Hengluo Commerce Guild medicine star produces plenty of them.

"How much do you need?" Lin Mufeng asked from the side.

"As much as you have, I want it all!" Yang Kai replied in a deep voice.

"All of it?" The three were startled, staring at Yang Kai in shock.

They had assumed Yang Kai only needed a few sets of pill ingredients, but he was asking for everything, with no bottom line.

Yang Kai explained, "Senior Zong Ao’s method for saving her is to refine a pill that produces a Pill Cloud. You know how difficult it is to create a Pill Cloud—it’s not something you succeed at in one or two tries. It takes countless attempts."

Hearing this, Halika and the others immediately understood why Yang Kai needed so many herbs, and couldn’t help but feel some respect. Halika nodded, "So that’s it. Master Zong Ao truly deserves his reputation as a great alchemy master, daring to attempt a pill with a Pill Cloud. We all admire him."

“In any case, this will be a losing deal for your branch,” Yang Kai reminded. “All the pills to be refined will be of the same kind, and even if you receive them all afterward, selling them will still be a problem — you should be prepared for that.”

"As long as we can wake Lady Xue, the losses don’t matter," Halika declared. He was truly afraid—if Lady Xue really died, Young Master Xue Yue would never let him off. Even if he had to exhaust his entire fortune, he would gather the needed herbs.

"That’s best!" Yang Kai was very satisfied with their cooperation. There was no need to say more; these people understood the situation and were easy to deal with.

"Brother..." Halika hesitated, glancing at Lin Mufeng, as if there was something he wanted to say but couldn’t bring himself to.

Yang Kai read their expressions and immediately understood. He said seriously, "For me, saving Lady Xue is the most important thing. I won’t interfere with anything else."

At these words, the three were overjoyed, looking at Yang Kai with even more kindness.

Although the three had obtained Profound Yin Moon Water and were excited, the incident on Rainfall Star was so serious that they didn’t know whether to report it to the main star. Normally, they could suppress news of Xue Yue’s injury, but now, with Yang Kai as Xue Yue’s guard—even if his cultivation was low—if he reported it first, they’d be in trouble.

If that happened, the three would face even harsher punishment!

With Yang Kai’s assurance, their hearts were finally at ease.

Yang Kai chuckled, "I don’t want to be punished by people from the main star either, so let’s keep Lady Xue’s injury quiet for now. When she recovers, she’ll decide what to do."

"Thank you, brother!" Halika said sincerely, cupping his fists.

"But as for the Profound Yin Moon Water... you’d best not touch it for now. Wait for Lady Xue to decide," Yang Kai added.

"Of course. Even if we had the guts, we wouldn’t dare use such a precious cultivation treasure without Lady Xue’s permission," Halika and the others nodded repeatedly, grateful that Yang Kai had shown them the right path.

In fact, they’d never planned to use the Profound Yin Moon Water. Though refining a drop would greatly boost their strength, none of them knew how to do it. Halika had personally tested its power—he lost an arm in the process. One misstep, and you could end up like Lady Xue.

Not daring to use it didn’t mean it wasn’t an achievement, so before Yang Kai arrived, the three had been happily admiring the container.

"Well, asking for your help before was for business. Now I have a personal favor to ask!" Yang Kai felt the time was right and the atmosphere was friendly, so he decided to see what else he could get from them.

"Please, brother!"

"Do you have any ways to quickly increase strength?" Yang Kai looked at the three expectantly.

"Increase strength?" Halika was surprised, looked him up and down, then laughed, "You want to boost your own power?"

"Exactly! This time, I couldn’t go into the ancient ruins because my strength was too low, so Lady Xue didn’t take me. If I were stronger, maybe I could have saved her at the critical moment and spared her from the Profound Yin Moon Water. If I could trade my life for Lady Xue’s safety, I wouldn’t mind dying, and you three wouldn’t be in such danger now!" Yang Kai looked anguished, as if tormented by guilt.

Halika and the others were all seasoned veterans—they could tell he was putting on an act.

Still, this little guard was clearly valued by Lady Xue. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have brought only him to Rainfall Star, nor cared so much for his safety.

Once Lady Xue woke up, they might need him to say a few good words to calm her anger.

Besides, he was helping them hide the truth from the main star, which was a huge favor.

Whether to curry favor or repay him, the three felt they should grant Yang Kai’s reasonable request. For a Second Stage Saint Realm cultivator to want to improve his strength, that was easy enough.

Exchanging glances, the three quickly made up their minds. Halika said, "If you want to quickly increase your strength, you’ll have to train hard. There’s no shortcut—everyone gains power bit by bit. But..."

He changed tone, grinning, "I do have a way to improve your cultivation efficiency."

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, "What way?"

Halika’s spatial ring flashed, and a brilliantly colored, orchid-like plant appeared in his hand. Its petals were strange—when they opened, they looked like a baby’s head, with clear features and a slightly eerie air.

"Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid?" Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman exclaimed, clearly shocked that Halika would bring out such a treasure. Their looks at Yang Kai were full of envy, as if he’d struck gold.

"What does it do?" Yang Kai asked.

Halika replied proudly, "It aids cultivation. If you take it directly, you’ll experience its wonders."

Lin Mufeng added, "This is rare stuff. Old Ha fought bloody battles for it back in the day. I remember it well—he’s kept it for nearly a century without using it. I thought he’d used it long ago."

Halika grinned, "I never found the right person. What’s the point of using it myself? I’m already Third Stage Origin Returning Realm—this wouldn’t help me much. I thought I’d give it to a promising junior, but on this vast Rainfall Star, not one caught my eye!"

Yang Kai moved fast—before Halika finished, he snatched the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid and stashed it in his own spatial ring.

From their conversation, he understood the orchid’s value, so he didn’t hesitate.

Then he looked expectantly at Lin Mufeng.

Lin Mufeng was still marveling at Halika’s generosity. When he met Yang Kai’s gaze, he winced, then quickly understood, slapped his forehead, and said, "I just remembered—I have something that might help you too."

Yang Kai’s meaning was clear—he was taking the chance to rob them blind, and Lin Mufeng couldn’t play dumb.

Suppressing his pain, Lin Mufeng put on a calm face, his spatial ring flashed, and he produced a bottle. Before he could speak, Yang Kai snatched it away.

Lin Mufeng smiled bitterly, "This is Snow Pool Crystal Essence, a product of the Snow Pool Forbidden Land on Ice Snow Star. Every thousand years, only a small amount condenses. I have just this little bit."

"What’s it for?" Yang Kai asked, inspecting the jade bottle. A chill emanated from it, and through the wall he could see a small piece of pure white substance, about the size of a fingernail.

"Snow Pool Crystal Essence is best for stabilizing the mind. One drop brings endless benefit. Since you want to quickly improve your cultivation, this is essential," Lin Mufeng explained.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he grinned widely.

What Lin Mufeng gave him complemented Halika’s Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid perfectly—one boosts cultivation efficiency, the other stabilizes the mind, preventing the drawbacks of rapid advancement. Their value was equal.

Yang Kai, completely satisfied, stored it in his spatial ring.
