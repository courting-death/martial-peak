## Chapter 1401 — Fierce Battle

Hearing Yang Kai's arrogant words, Elder Du laughed heartily: "Kid, you don't know how high the sky is and how deep the earth is. When I strode across the world, you were probably still nursing — and yet you dare to speak so shamelessly. Fine, let me teach you properly how to address your elders!"

No sooner had the words fallen than a scarlet radiance shot out from the front. Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, instinctively sensing danger, but he clearly saw no sign that Elder Du had made a move and had no idea where the attack had come from.

Suspicion rose in his heart, but there was no time to investigate; in a hurry he produced the Purple Shield and held it before his chest.

Boom... a tremendous crash rang out as a great force struck. Yang Kai was forced to take several stumbling steps back, his chest's Qi and blood surging. Though uninjured, he was greatly wary of the strange attack, for the power contained within that blow was immense. If it had hit someone with even slightly poorer fleshly constitution, even with the Purple Shield as protection they would have taken a heavy hit.

When Elder Du saw the Purple Shield, his eyes flashed with a fervent light and he cried in surprise: "An Origin-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure?"

He had a keen eye and immediately perceived the Purple Shield's exceptional nature. When the purple shield was first forged it had been only Origin-Grade Lower-Level, but after several refinements and repairs by Yang Yan, it had become Origin-Grade Upper-Level.

A Secret Treasure of that caliber was rare on Dark Star. Elder Du held a high position on Myriad Beasts Mountain and his cultivation reached the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, but the best Secret Treasure he possessed was only Origin-Grade Middle-Level, and that had been obtained by chance from an ancient ruin.

That a mere Saint King Realm like Yang Kai would produce an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure, and a defensive one at that, filled Elder Du with jealousy and greed.

If he could kill this brat now, that Secret Treasure would become his! Elder Jin Shi wanted only the Xuan Gold, he had not demanded the youth's possessions. And since the other had shown such a high-grade treasure at the outset, who knew what else he might have?

With that thought, fire lit in Elder Du's heart. Killing intent flickered in his eyes as his Divine Sense moved; another scarlet radiance slammed toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai again did not dodge, not out of arrogance but because he wanted to discover where the attack originated. He pushed his Divine Sense to the limit and stared unblinking.

After a moment, astonishment spread across his face.

He discovered that the scarlet, light-shaped attack was not a technique of the Myriad Beasts Mountain elder at all, but the tongue that had shot out from the Green-Eyed Blood Toad beneath his seat!

No wonder it had such force. The Green-Eyed Blood Toad was a Ninth-Tier demonic beast, and its tongue was one of the most elastic parts of its body — it was understandable that it could bounce someone backward.

The instant Yang Kai saw through it, the scarlet tongue slammed against the Purple Shield again. This time Yang Kai was prepared; his body only swayed slightly and he neutralized most of the force. As he prepared to counterattack, Elder Du wore a look of smug delight, patted the Green-Eyed Blood Toad, poured Saint Yuan into it continuously and barked: "Come to me!"

At the same time, Yang Kai felt a tremendous suction from the shield in his hand, pulling him forward.

Looking closely, Yang Kai's eyelids twitched: the scarlet long tongue of the Green-Eyed Blood Toad had sprouted countless tiny suckers. Using these suction cups, the tongue could adhere to the Purple Shield and drag it back.

The old man intended to steal his Secret Treasure? Yang Kai immediately saw through his intent. He sneered coldly and called forth a lump of black Demonic Flame in his hand, the blaze radiating a ferocious heat as he lunged to seize the scarlet tongue.

"You brat are courting death!" Seeing this, Elder Du was not angry but delighted. His captive Green-Eyed Blood Toad was thick-skinned and extraordinarily durable, and its whole body was laced with potent poison.

Not to mention that tongue—just a mere Saint King Realm cultivator, daring to grab the poisonous tongue of a Green-Eyed Blood Toad with his bare hands? That was like an old man hanging himself—courting death because he’d lived too long.

Sizzle...

A strange sound rang out and a scorched smell wafted. Yang Kai gripped the Green-Eyed Blood Toad's poisonous tongue and the Demonic Flame rolled, wrapping half the tongue in black fire.

Human-like pain flickered within the Green-Eyed Blood Toad’s two beastly eyes. Its cheeks bulged as it let out a series of low, croaking sounds.

"Impossible!" Elder Du's face went pale with shock. He had never imagined his demonic beast would suffer such a loss while the other party remained unbothered. Seeing the black flames crawl down the tongue like a wildfire toward him, Elder Du realized something was amiss: this black fire seemed exceptional — not only did it not fear poison, it was extremely troublesome.

He immediately ordered his demonic beast to release the Purple Shield, and the Green-Eyed Blood Toad drew its scarlet tongue back.

In the blink of an eye the long poisonous tongue vanished. The Green-Eyed Blood Toad bulged its cheeks a few times, then opened its huge mouth and spat out a mouthful of black blood.

"You dare harm my demonic beast!" Elder Du spat through clenched teeth. He had thought this would be an easy chance to kill and seize treasure, but instead he had failed, and after the black fire entered its belly his companion beast was evidently injured.

In a fury he pointed, and the pustules covering the Green-Eyed Blood Toad burst open, unleashing spurts of iridescent, foul-smelling venom. Those liquids twisted midair and formed into small arrow-like darts that shot toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face grew grave. Even without touching them he knew these venoms were not to be trifled with. His expression hardened and he casually tossed out a compact refining furnace.

A Void King-Grade refining furnace!

The moment the refining furnace appeared it radiated torrid heat. Spinning rapidly, it unfurled and in a flash formed a furnace several zhang tall. With a bird's cry, the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit emerged gracefully, spewing a sheet of crimson radiance toward the myriad venomous darts.

Fire and venom met with snapping crackles, and for a time the confrontation looked evenly matched.

Elder Du's face shifted as he stared at the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit with both greed and apprehension, unsure what to make of it.

Yang Kai, however, was calm and composed, a faint smile touching his lips. The Artifact Spirit was far stronger than before; dealing with a Ninth-Tier demonic beast should pose no problem.

Suddenly a murderous attack slashed from the front — Elder Du, seeing his demonic beast entangled and unable to break free, had decided to strike at Yang Kai. The single-handed axe in his hand brimmed with killing intent, and a black gleam cut out with a single swing.

Facing the might of the Secret Treasure, Yang Kai did not act rashly. Though his Saint Yuan flow would be suppressed in this place, the opponent was still a practitioner of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and Yang Kai had never met such an enemy face-to-face before.

With a flick of his ten fingers, clusters of Demonic Flame rose and, under Yang Kai's Divine Sense, those flames swayed and suddenly took the shapes of flying birds, coming one after another to meet the killing gleam.

“Yuan Control Art?” Elder Du’s eyelids twitched violently. To think he would witness such a refined display of Yuan Control Art from a mere Third Stage Saint King Realm cultivator! Even he himself could not command detached Saint Yuan to such perfection—let alone someone of the Saint King Realm.

But the reality before him left no room for doubt.

The flame-birds formed from Demonic Flame collided with the killing gleam and, after a thunderous boom, both vanished without a trace.

"What good is mastering Yuan Control when, before me, you are nothing but prey to be slaughtered!" Elder Du's face turned grim. With a roar, an invisible force radiated outward from him, enveloping Yang Kai.

A stifling heaviness spread, making even the twitch of a finger extremely difficult.

Shi! And the Shi of a cultivator at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, indeed far stronger than of the First Stage.

Elder Du was not satisfied with mere pressure; after pinning Yang Kai with his Shi, he tossed his single-handed axe forward, pouring Saint Yuan into it as he bellowed: "Go!"

The axe absorbed the elder's Saint Yuan and suddenly spat out more killing intent. In its gyration the axe transformed into a black python over ten zhang long.

The giant python lashed and lunged with terrifying ferocity, gaping its maw as it flew toward where Yang Kai stood, as if to swallow him whole.

Elder Du's face twisted into a savage grin. As a practitioner of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, taking such pains against a Third Stage Saint King enraged him, but in comparison to the youth's possessions this strike was worthwhile.

He looked confident and ready to witness Yang Kai be smashed to pieces.

Suddenly streaks of golden light flashed. Gold filled the sky and, under the slicing brilliance, Elder Du felt his gathered force scatter like calm water struck by countless pebbles, quickly thrown into chaos and no longer able to suppress his opponent even a bit.

This brat... could even dispel the Shi of the Origin Returning Realm?

And that golden light seemed vaguely familiar, but Elder Du could not recall where he had seen it.

It was no wonder he couldn't remember — Yang Kai's Golden Blood Threads differed greatly from the Demon Blood Threads of the Demon Blood Sect. Though from the same source, the Demon Blood Sect members did not possess Yang Kai's innate edge. They refined Demon Blood Threads using tricks to bolster their Qi and blood or by absorbing the blood essence of foes.

Thus, while they could strengthen their Demon Blood Threads, the results were somewhat mixed and impure, and gave off a sinister, uncanny air.

Yang Kai's Golden Blood Threads, however, were formed from his own Golden Blood, supremely pure and far more authentic than Demon Blood Threads. A middle-aged man from the Demon Blood Sect might be able to perceive the difference, but Elder Du did not possess such discrimination.
