## Chapter 744 — Ancient Ruins

Though Yang Kai had been on the Tongxuan Continent for three or four years, he still only had a half-understanding of the affairs here.

Only after listening to the inn’s server did he realize that the Saintess’s patrol of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was in fact an event grand enough to shake the entire world.

And it was only at that moment he understood the Nine Heavens Sacred Land did not have only the one Saintess he had seen before.

There were four in total, each heading in a different direction; the Saintesses' routes practically covered all territories where humans lived.

These Saintesses had been raised within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land since childhood, cultivated for ten or twenty years and selected through repeated trials; each was young and beautiful and had mastered the Sacred Land's special secret methods.

Their primary purpose in touring was to seek the next Sacred Lord for the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

The current Sacred Lord was advanced in years and likely not to live much longer, hence the four Saintesses set out ostentatiously on their journeys.

As for the method by which they chose the Sacred Lord, the world knew nothing; only that every Sacred Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had been found by a Saintess.

Historical records show that the nine predecessors, before being discovered by a Saintess, were engaged in all manner of occupations.

Some were young talents already famous across the land, some were ordinary porters and merchants, and some were mediocre and unremarkable—but once found by a Saintess and brought into the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, that person would burst forth with astonishing brilliance and undergo a life-shattering transformation.

The ages of those nine when found ranged anywhere from their teens to sixty years old.

The Saintesses seemed to possess a vision unlike that of ordinary people.

Therefore, wherever a Saintess arrived, those who harbored fantasies would carefully put on a show; if one were truly chosen by a Saintess, it would be the sort of good fortune said to make one’s ancestors bless them from the grave.

That was why the island was full of those affected and deliberately performing for attention.

They did not know by what means the Saintess selected a Sacred Lord, nor whether the powerful experts accompanying her were already watching the whole island; all they could do was strive to be perfect and avoid any mistake.

Yang Kai listened in astonishment; never before had he imagined that such bizarre occurrences existed in the world.

"Server, you seem to know quite a lot," Yang Kai said admiringly.

The inn's server chuckled: "It's common knowledge; it seems you're the only one on the whole island who doesn't know."

Yang Kai looked at him meaningfully and said, "Don't you have any thoughts? By your account, the Sacred Lord before being found could very well be a commoner—there might be a chance for you."

"I do, how could I not?" the server nodded heavily. "But someone like a Saintess is far beyond me; if she were to favor me it would be my good fortune, if not then it's only natural. I'll live as I always have; I won't put on a play."

Yang Kai was impressed by the server's calm attitude; clasping his fist, he said, "Very well, server, I wish you good fortune."

"Thank you for the kind words!" the server replied with a beaming face and returned to his work.

After dining and drinking at the inn and gathering the information he wanted, Yang Kai departed.

He had nothing urgent to attend to, so he was in no hurry to leave; he was curious about the Saintesses' search for the Sacred Lord and wanted to see what kind of person might be found.

Naturally he intended to stay and watch the commotion.

The more than twenty nearby isles were unusually lively; since the Saintess's arrival the young men seemed electrified and were at the height of their excitement.

Yang Kai stayed about ten days, ran across the larger and smaller isles, experienced the local customs, and bought many medicinal herbs; unfortunately, the matter he was watching produced no movement.

After the Saintess arrived she seemed to disappear without a trace, she seemed to vanish without a trace — let alone seek out that mysterious Sacred Lord.

While Yang Kai roamed the isles, on one island inside a palace, the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm cultivator Qian Shu respectfully approached the Saintess and anxiously asked, "Miss, still no response?"

The Saintess slowly shook her head.

Qian Shu's expression dimmed and he sighed, "This is already the eighth place we've come to; it seems the Sacred Lord is not here. In a few days we'll leave and go to the next place."

The Saintess nodded without protest; she had known since childhood the weight of the responsibility she bore and had long aimed for this goal—she and her three sisters would see that at least one of them found the next Sacred Lord amid this vast sea of people.

"Qian Shu, we've been here so many days without going out. Today I'd like to go out with Bei'er to see the scenery, is that all right?" the Saintess suddenly asked.

Qian Shu considered briefly and nodded, "Very well. But Miss, you should dress up a little before going out."

“Don’t worry, I know my own limits!” After receiving Qian Shu’s permission, the Sacred Maiden’s mood brightened considerably.

After a bit of dressing, the two women went out in high spirits, quietly trailed by two experts of the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm in case of emergency.

...

On the island, while Yang Kai was searching a shop for rare medicinal herbs, a shocking fluctuation of energy swept over from not far away; accompanied by a tremendous bang, the entire isle seemed to tremble.

Everyone on the isle changed expression, uncertain of what had happened. Yang Kai's face sharpened; he hurried from the herb shop, leapt into the air, and looked toward the source of the sound.

Out on the sea a pillar of water soared into the sky and was now slowly descending, as if something extraordinary had occurred in the ocean's depths.

Some people were hurrying back from the sea, and many warriors unaware of the situation were making their way toward the spot.

At the same time Yang Kai sensed a most pleasant aura.

It was the scent of Yang-attribute energy—clearly released from the ocean's depths by the recent disturbance.

Startled, he sped toward it as well.

The sea’s Water Spiritual Qi is extremely dense, so under normal circumstances Yang-attribute things cannot form; if one does, it means the object is by no means ordinary.

Yang Kai was eager to know what kind of thing could be emitting such energy.

But before he could get close he was stopped by several people—apparently warriors from the local Seven Families Alliance who had formed a defensive line along the coast and forbade anyone from approaching.

Although many outsiders had gathered, everyone adhered to the principle of not courting trouble; none forced their way in. They stood at a distance, looking toward the sea and whispering among themselves.

Yang Kai listened for a while but could not pick up any useful information, only that the disturbance had occurred with extreme suddenness.

Soon many powerful experts arrived on the isle.

These were the same people Yang Kai had seen earlier when the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's great ship had landed to welcome the Saintess—the stronger figures of the Seven Families Alliance.

They gathered together, speaking in low voices with grave expressions, glancing from time to time toward the crowds of outsiders.

Yang Kai kept watching; the Yang-attribute energy emanating from the sea seemed to grow thicker and more abundant, and his curiosity deepened.

After waiting a full half day, just as Yang Kai was considering whether to sneak into the ocean's depths under cover of night to investigate, the Seven Families Alliance apparently reached a decision.

A yellow-faced elder of the Transcendent Realm strolled toward the crowd and, stopping a short distance away, cleared his throat: "Everyone, you have surely heard of the earlier disturbance, and some have even witnessed it. Our Seven Families Alliance will not conceal the matter—out of courtesy to guests and a desire to share good fortune, we announce that beneath some part of the sea under this isle there appears to be an Ancient Ruin."

A burst of exclamations rose up.

Yang Kai's expression shifted noticeably.

The words "Ancient Ruin" fell like thunder in the ears of the crowd, stunning everyone.

The yellow-faced elder swept a glance over the people, pleased with their reaction, and smiled: "Do not doubt it; that is undeniably an Ancient Ruin. Our Seven Families Alliance had suspected its presence earlier and sent people down to investigate. It was only because one of the ruin's seals was triggered that such an uproar occurred. Those who returned have confirmed this."

"Old man, what are you planning? Are you trying to get us to go down and scout so your Seven Families Alliance can take advantage?" someone shouted.

At that remark everyone could not help but become wary and turned their eyes to the yellow-faced elder.

Such a windfall would not reasonably be told to outsiders for no reason—obviously they wanted to tempt others to go down and investigate so the Seven Families Alliance could pick up the spoils. That meant the place below must be fraught with danger, otherwise the Alliance would already have gone in.

The yellow-faced elder chuckled and unexpectedly admitted, "We did have that thought, but it is not entirely like that. The Seven Families Alliance knows its own limits—if any of you insist on forcing your way down to take a share, we cannot prevent you."

Someone laughed aloud.

Because the Saintess's arrival had drawn so many outsiders, and although most of their cultivations were not impressive, it would be impossible to block them all.

One group might go down first and another would follow in their wake.

The elder's frank words were spoken plainly and won him much favor.

"Therefore, after our discussion, the Seven Families Alliance has a proposal; please hear it," he continued.

"Old man, speak quickly!" someone called.

"Let the Seven Families Alliance take the lead and go down to investigate what exactly is hidden in that Ancient Ruin. Those who wish to follow are to register at that table and be recorded; if rewards are obtained, the Seven Families Alliance will share with you. This way everyone benefits and unpleasant incidents can be avoided. However, I must warn you—what lies within that Ancient Ruin we truly do not know. Where there is profit there is risk; if you choose to act with us, be prepared—if lives are lost, we will not be responsible!"
