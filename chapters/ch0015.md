## Chapter 15 — Entering the Mountain to Seek Herbs

After finishing his cultivation, Yang Kai spent over an hour completing his tasks for the day before heading toward the Contribution Hall.

Though he had decided to enter the mountain to search for herbs, Yang Kai knew little about herbal medicine. He had only heard the names of the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower and the Desolate Deadwood Herb but had never seen them in person. If he were to encounter them now, he might not even recognize them.

Thus, thorough preparation was essential to avoid a fruitless trip. Yang Kai’s purpose in visiting the Contribution Hall was to first familiarize himself with the appearance of these two herbs.

He had initially hoped that Shopkeeper Meng would open a convenient door and personally teach him to identify the herbs, but to his surprise, Meng simply tossed him a small booklet.

Taking it in hand, Yang Kai found it to be a detailed herbal guide. It not only described the medicinal effects and properties of the herbs but also their natural habitats. Each page was illustrated, providing comprehensive information. The only slight disappointment was that the booklet covered only Common Grade herbs; there was nothing beyond that.

In the world of cultivation, humans are divided into levels and realms, and so too are herbs, weapons, and pills. From lowest to highest, the grades are Common, Earth, Heaven, Mystery, Spirit, and Saint, each subdivided into upper, middle, and lower levels.

The Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower and Desolate Deadwood Herb that Yang Kai sought were both low-tier Common Grade herbs, with modest medicinal effects and correspondingly low value.

Leaving the Contribution Hall, Yang Kai went to the Miscellaneous Affairs Office to request leave. After all, he was still a sweeper at Lingxiao Pavilion, and once he entered Black Wind Mountain, he certainly would not return that day. It was only proper to inform them.

The steward at the office did not make things difficult and readily granted him three days off. With that settled, Yang Kai set out.

The foot of Black Wind Mountain was only twenty li from Lingxiao Pavilion—not too far, yet not close either. Yang Kai was quite familiar with the area, having often ventured there for hunting.

However, this was his first time entering the mountain specifically to gather herbs. He had prepared well, bringing some clean water, a few rice balls, a small shovel, and a cloth bag.

After a hurried hour, Yang Kai arrived at the base of Black Wind Mountain. Looking out, the dark mountain forest stretched like a primordial beast lying across the land, its end lost to the horizon. The woods were lush and green, interspersed with jagged rocks, presenting a unique and striking landscape. The gentle breeze that blew toward him felt refreshingly cool.

Black Wind Mountain was home to many fierce beasts and predatory birds, many of which even skilled cultivators found difficult to contend with. Therefore, those who entered the mountain without sufficient strength dared not venture too deep. The outer thirty li were relatively safe, but beyond that lay increasing danger.

Yang Kai only sought low-value herbs and thus had no intention of going too far inside, ensuring his safety.

During the hour’s journey, Yang Kai did not idle. He continuously tried to recall the herbs he had encountered during previous trips into Black Wind Mountain. At that time, unfamiliar with them, he had not collected any. Now, well-prepared, he could not afford to miss any opportunity.

His recollections proved fruitful, bringing to mind several locations. He even remembered a spot where one of the herbs he needed grew.

Filled with renewed vigor, Yang Kai followed the familiar path into the mountain.

Half an hour later, he successfully gathered a Toothgrass hidden among the thorns, a promising start. His scattered memories became clearer, and he proceeded by following the clues, collecting herbs along the way. By evening, he had gathered four different herbs.

Being on the mountain’s outskirts, where people often passed, herbs rarely grew long before being picked. So although he had only collected four plants, Yang Kai was quite satisfied.

None of these four herbs were the ones he needed, and all were low-tier Common Grade, but they could still be exchanged for some Contribution Points.

As the sun neared the horizon, Yang Kai quickened his pace, finally arriving at the last remembered location of herbs before nightfall.

This was a peculiar place. The surrounding vegetation was lush, yet this patch, about three zhang across, was a barren wasteland. There were no trees, not even weeds.

In the center of this dead zone stood three small grasses arranged in a triangular formation. Their color was a withered yellow, appearing as if they were dying, but this was their natural hue.

Seeing the herbs still there, Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief. Smiling broadly, he hurried over and began digging vigorously with his shovel.

Before long, all three plants were safely collected.

Still somewhat uneasy, Yang Kai compared them carefully with the illustrations in Shopkeeper Meng’s booklet. Only then did he relax, confirming these were indeed Desolate Deadwood Herbs. The specimens matched perfectly, and the growth environment was exactly as described.

The Desolate Deadwood Herb grew in places where all other vegetation had withered and died, making them relatively easy to locate. Whenever a patch of dead land appeared in the forest, it was almost certainly due to the presence of this herb.

Carefully placing the three herbs into his cloth bag, Yang Kai then took out some water and rice balls and ate on the spot.

The main purpose of this trip was to find the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower and the Desolate Deadwood Herb. So far, he had only found one type, and in small quantity at that. He would have to redouble his efforts.

However, as night was falling, it was no longer convenient to continue. Yang Kai decided to rest here overnight and resume his search at dawn.

Previously, when hunting in the mountain, he had always returned the same day and never spent a night inside. But as the saying goes, if you haven’t eaten pork, you’ve at least seen pigs run. Yang Kai knew what to be cautious about when staying overnight in the mountains.

He found a large tree nearby, climbed up, and settled into a comfortable spot to rest with his eyes closed.

Unable to fall asleep immediately, Yang Kai summoned the Wordless Black Book and flipped to the third page. With a thought, the incense burner materialized from within.

This was a secret Yang Kai had discovered by chance: items summoned from the Black Book could also be returned to it. After all, the Black Book was made from a Soul-Calming Stone, which inherently possessed spatial and storage functions. It was not surprising that the incense burner could be stored inside.

What puzzled Yang Kai was that, apart from the incense burner, no other items could be accepted by the Black Book. This left him wondering if the Soul-Calming Stone-made Wordless Black Book had selective storage capabilities.

After playing with the Black Book for a while, Yang Kai grew tired. Having traveled extensively through the mountains today, he soon fell into a deep sleep.

The night passed uneventfully. Early the next morning, Yang Kai practiced the Body Tempering Chapter for half an hour as usual, achieving good results. Not only did he land more punches than in the previous two days, but the qi sense within his body grew increasingly solid. He felt as if he was on the verge of breaking through a barrier; the qi in his meridians seemed to have reached its limit, needing only one final push to ascend to the next level.
