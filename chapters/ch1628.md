## Chapter 1628 — Do You Know Him?

“Why is this place expanding? Could something have gone wrong?” Chu Lingxiao said, his concern faintly showing.

“It should be related to the Sect Master; everyone need not worry.” A voice suddenly came from behind. The experts of the human, yao, and demon races turned to look and saw Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi, Mo Yu and Lin Yurao — four Origin Returning Realm peak experts — arriving together.

The three races dared not be negligent and all cupped their hands in salute.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others quickly returned the courtesy.

Clearly everyone recognized one another and knew each other’s status.

Although Yang Xiuzhu and the others were far stronger in cultivation than the experts of the three races, Ling Taixu and the others were, after all, extremely close to Yang Kai, so they did not act arrogantly and treated them as peers.

“Related to Yang Kai?” Ling Taixu grew interested. “Brother Yang, could you explain in detail?”

The others turned their gazes to Yang Xiuzhu with curious looks.

Yang Xiuzhu pondered for a moment and said, “The higher the Sect Master’s cultivation, and the deeper his comprehension of Spatial Force, the broader this patch of heaven and earth becomes.”

He did not know much about the Xuan Realm Pearl; as a former elder of Star Emperor Mountain he only knew it was a spatial Secret Treasure of Imperial Treasure caliber, and beyond that he could only offer a general explanation.

Hearing this, the others all nodded.

“So this is Yang Kai’s doing? Has he come here?” Changyuan bore a suspicious look, releasing his Divine Sense to probe. After a moment his expression changed: “He really has arrived; it seems he is in seclusion with that girl Xia. The fluctuations of this power are very strange. Could it truly be Spatial Force?”

“It should be!”

As they spoke, the expansion of the Small Xuan Realm still had not ceased.

It expanded from a hundred li across to a distance of ten thousand li before gradually calming.

At the edge of the little world, some obscure force seemed to be blocking, concealing Yang Kai’s Spatial Force fluctuations and keeping much of the heaven and earth sealed, preventing anyone from seeing the whole picture.

“Huh, over there there’s actually a cluster of buildings!” Lei Long, sharp-eyed, immediately spotted a newly appeared group of structures in the far distance. They were not densely built — appearing scattered yet strewn across the land like the stars, as if hiding some secret.

“Shall we go take a look?” The crowd showed curiosity; some wished to go and investigate.

“Ha ha. I’ll go scout ahead!” A loud laugh rang out. Di Mo transformed into a streak of light and rushed over without fear.

The others shook their heads slowly but all followed closely.

Yang Xiuzhu and the other four exchanged glances and, wryly smiling, followed as well.

Shortly, everyone arrived at the site of the buildings, and the moment they stepped foot there, their spirits were stirred.

The Spiritual Qi of this place was at least two to three times richer than where they had been before, which meant that if one cultivated here, efficiency would be at least double what it had been.

“This place is good; my yao clan will take a portion!” Lei Long strode forward without hesitation and carved out a large area for himself.

“Then the demon clan will take this section,” Changyuan quickly declared.

Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya exchanged a look; the former appeared calm and leisurely, saying without haste, “Then the remainder can belong to the humans.”

In a few words, the three-race experts divided the newly arisen cluster of buildings and each occupied substantial territory.

“It seems the newly appeared heaven and earth has much richer Spiritual Qi; if Yang Kai later opens more of the world, they should be even better than this, right?” Chu Lingxiao mused.

“That is likely the case.”

“Who knows how large this place truly is; if it’s big enough, I would be willing to never leave it my whole life,” Changyuan laughed heartily.

He suddenly realized that the decision he once made to follow Yang Kai out of Tongxuan Continent with the demon clan’s elite had been the right one.

Had he stayed on Tongxuan Continent, how could he have had the chance to rise to the Saint King Realm or to glimpse higher Martial Dao?

Perhaps he would have died an old man without ever surpassing what the Great Demon God achieved in his day.

Yet now the legend of the Great Demon God had been shattered by countless people.

Changyuan felt this way, and Lei Long felt much the same.

In their hearts they were filled with gratitude toward Yang Kai.

Over the next few days, the human, yao, and demon races collectively relocated, abandoning their previous pavilion dwellings and flooding into the newly appeared cluster of buildings.

Time passed in a blink — another three months went by.

Yang Kai emerged from seclusion.

Xia Ningshang still stood guard in front of the pavilion. Yang Kai called her in and inquired about the Small Xuan Realm, and upon learning of the great changes here he was greatly surprised.

The expansion of the Small Xuan Realm was natural; as his cultivation and understanding of Spatial Force deepened, this patch of heaven and earth would inevitably slowly reveal itself and gradually show its true form.

Yang Kai was also curious about how large the place truly was.

Yet the sudden emergence of a cluster of buildings was somewhat unexpected.

It was not a bad thing; after emerging from seclusion Yang Kai took Xia Ningshang to survey the area, confirmed there was no danger, and found the cultivation environment was two to three times better than before, so he was reassured.

After that, he went to see Qian Tong.

Qian Tong was largely unhurt; although he had taken some minor wounds under Luo Hai’s pressure on the outskirts of Cuiwei Star, he had advanced to the Void King Realm and recovered quickly, now working hard to consolidate his realm.

Everything prospered, and Yang Kai was completely at ease; he personally found Xia Ningshang a very suitable residence and remained in the Small Xuan Realm.

Yang Kai wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to diligently cultivate the Yao Transformation Technique and develop the Golden Sacred Dragon’s Origin Force within his body.

And being together with Little Senior Sister naturally meant romance and affectionate moments.

Those days were the most comfortable Yang Kai had experienced in decades.

On Icebound Island, in Ran Yunting’s ice chamber.

Su Yan was like a pristine flower blooming in a world of ice and snow, cool in aura, dressed in white surpassing the snow, her long hair falling over her shoulders.

“You want to go out to undergo trials?” Ran Yunting knit her brows.

Su Yan had come to see her today and unexpectedly put forward such a request, greatly surprising Ran Yunting.

“Yes!” Su Yan nodded.

“Why suddenly desire to go out and undergo trials?” Ran Yunting smiled. “You are at a crucial moment in breaking through to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Going out now is not a good idea. Moreover, Chi Lan Star is rife with treachery. Although you have lived on the inner island for a long time, you may have heard some news. If you go out and encounter people from Fire Radiance Sect it will be troublesome. You know that that scoundrel Wei Feng still pines for you, and the Fire Radiance Sect is using that as an excuse to target Ice Heart Valley, insisting we hand you over.”

“I understand,” Su Yan spoke softly. “It is precisely because of that that I wish to go out and train; perhaps after spending some time outside my cultivation will advance.”

“Hmm, it’s not impossible.” Ran Yunting was somewhat distressed. If this had been another time, she would not have stopped Su Yan from going to train. Although her disciple was only of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, her actual combat strength was in no way inferior to someone of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

She was the sort who could fight above her ranks — an elite among elites.

With the special Ice-Crystal Yu Body constitution and Ice Heart Valley’s secret Ice Jade Skill, there were few opponents below the Void King Realm who could contend with her.

A warrior’s cultivation is not achieved by closed-door practice alone; going out to undergo trials has always been the surest path to growth.

But now, with the sudden changes on Chi Lan Star, Ran Yunting could not bear to let Su Yan go out.

While pondering what excuse to use to dissuade Su Yan and keep her obediently on Icebound Island, Ran Yunting suddenly seemed to discover something; she fixed her gaze on Su Yan, her brows knitting tighter.

Immediately she released her Divine Sense and swept Su Yan from head to toe.

“Have you encountered a problem in your cultivation? What has muddied your jade-pure heart? Why has your cultivation dropped?” Ran Yunting’s complexion changed.

She unexpectedly sensed that Su Yan’s cultivation had decreased rather than increased compared to some days earlier.

Although the drop was small, Ran Yunting, as her master, could naturally detect it.

This revelation made Ran Yunting’s eyes show alarm.

Su Yan’s innate talent, though not the absolute highest, combined with her special constitution and Icebound Island’s secret skill could make up for any slight deficiency in aptitude.

Moreover, her talent truly was outstanding; perhaps few in the entire Star Domain could rival her.

Her cultivation had always risen; such a strange occurrence had never before happened.

Ran Yunting’s expression shifted repeatedly. “Impossible — you are suffering backlash from your art; you’ve been moved by emotion. Who is this man that could move you?”

At that moment her face nearly grew savage; the Saint Yuan inside her body roared madly.

Practicing Ice Jade Skill granted Su Yan a jade-pure heart; as long as that heart remained pure she could advance by leaps and bounds each day.

Conversely, she would suffer backlash from the art, and the more impure the jade-pure heart became, the greater the price she would pay.

The chief enemy of a jade-pure heart’s purity was emotion itself.

This was something every generation of practitioners of Ice Jade Skill had to avoid at all costs.

A jade-pure heart is immaculate, and when emotion stirs it is like black ink, quickly polluting it.

Ran Yunting almost immediately saw through the truth of the matter.

“No — you have lived on the inner island for years and had no chance to come into contact with men!” Ran Yunting quickly shook her head, then suddenly remembered something and ground her teeth: “Su Yan, tell your master — is this related to that portrait you saw the other day? Do you know that man?”

Ran Yunting was quick-minded; in a very short time she thought of countless possibilities, and this was the most likely.

That moment when Su Yan saw the portrait, and the odd change in her expression, further strengthened Ran Yunting’s suspicion.

Faced with her master’s questioning, Su Yan bit her red lip and a trace of guilt flickered across her face, but it soon vanished and she spoke softly, “I know him.”

Ran Yunting’s face paled and her voice trembled as she asked, “What sort of relationship do you have with him?”

“He is my Junior Brother, and he is also my man!”

As she spoke those words, a faint smile curved Su Yan’s lips, appearing utterly sweet.
