## Chapter 785 — Death Struggle

With a cold sneer, Yang Kai reached out and tore off his ragged long robe, exposing a lean, powerful torso; flesh swollen and trembling, strength interwoven, his breath deep, refined, and formidable.

Standing at the very heart of the Wind Blade's rampage, he let the blades sweep over him yet remained as immovable as a mountain, taking the Wind Blade's shredding blows squarely without showing the slightest sign of collapse.

“Friend, your strength just doesn’t cut it!”

A ripple of astonished voices erupted.

The demonfolk in the stands were filled with surprise, their faces showing shock.

They had expected Di Xiao to handle Yang Kai personally and defeat—or even kill—him in short order, but the scene unfolding before them was unexpectedly different.

Within the Wind Blade’s sheath, Yang Kai bore only countless tiny cuts; there was no great injury. His bodily toughness seemed to have reached some extreme, allowing him to withstand such attacks outright.

Everyone clicked their tongues in amazement.

Yang Kai’s taunt turned Di Xiao’s face ugly; he smiled darkly and said, "Ignorant of your place—I’ll see how long you can hold out!"

As he spoke, both hands suddenly moved. With his motion, the cyclones sweeping the Death Arena seemed to come alive, converging toward Yang Kai’s position from all sides, leaving no corner untouched.

Those tornadoes fused and swelled as they closed in, until they became a single massive, pitch-black whirlwind full of murderous intent.

Like a monstrous dragon, it reared and lashed its tail, bearing down to collide with Yang Kai.

"True Yuan manifestation! I have that too!" Yang Kai grinned, and with a clarion cry a huge dragon head materialized behind him.

Its golden hue dazzled the eyes, its momentum ferocious to the extreme.

The dragon head writhed monstrously, and soon a longer, more powerful golden jiao dragon surged forth to clash with the jet-black whirlwind. They tore into one another.

In an instant, the sky above the Death Arena was shrouded in gold and black, light and shadow interplaying.

Yang Kai’s jiao dragon sprang from the golden dragon pattern on his back; originally it could only be unleashed while in a demonic state, but since his soul-bond with Su Yan at the Ice Sect, he could now release it at will. The golden dragon contained fragments of Yang Kai’s divine awareness, making it more spirited and deadly than Di Xiao’s purely martial techniques.

The two dragons clashed in a brutal, explosive duel.

Nearly everyone was seized by that magnificent spectacle, staring unblinkingly at the heavens above the Death Arena to see which dragon would prevail.

Boom! Boom! Boom...

Amid deafening detonations, beams of light braided together like a volcanic eruption; the pitch-black whirlwind was forced back by the golden dragon, its color dimming as it retreated.

True Yang Yuan Qi is forever the bane of demonic energy; the aura radiating from the golden dragon made every demon present uneasy.

Suddenly a bestial roar sounded; two figures in the Death Arena collided and separated in an instant, and blood stained the ground.

While everyone’s attention had been seized by the two dragons above, Yang Kai and Di Xiao had already slammed into one another and were now exchanging full-force blows.

Terrifying blasts of energy radiated across every corner of the Death Arena. When they broke apart, Yang Kai hunched over, clutching his belly; blood gushed from between his fingers.

The pain was excruciating; in a single moment of contact he felt as if his body had been pierced by a thousand strikes—ridges and gaping wounds tore across his bare torso, deep down to the bone.

Di Xiao, as befits a chief general under Gou Qiong, was truly formidable: peak Third Stage Transcendent cultivation, superior combat sense and abundant battlefield experience—he’d seized the initiative.

Although Yang Kai was in a rough state, Di Xiao was also suffering.

Flesh and muscle along his arm and neck inexplicably vanished in chunks, blood dripping steadily, his aura raging in chaos and his face contorted.

They stared at one another, gasping; their eyes reddened simultaneously. In that moment a bloodthirsty thought surged up, swallowing their minds—each of them had only one intent: to kill the other!

Seeing the blood flow from Yang Kai’s abdomen, Xueli in the stands abruptly rose to her feet, her beautiful eyes trembling as she fixed him with an unbelieving stare, as if she had discovered something astonishing.

"My lady!" Yu Mo cried out immediately on seeing the scene.

Xueli’s brows knit tightly; she drew in a deep breath, shock written on her face, and only after a long moment did she slowly sit down.

Yu Mo looked puzzled, unsure why Xueli had reacted so strongly. Although Yang Kai’s performance exceeded everyone’s expectations, it hardly seemed a reason for such a display.

What had the Lady noticed? Yu Mo pondered briefly and slowly shook his head, then turned his attention back to the battle below.

The murderous intent rolled like a tide; even from the stands it could be felt clearly. Powerful as Yu Mo was, his pores involuntarily shut, afraid his will might be affected by the killing aura.

Di Xiao was indeed excellent, and Yang Kai was no slouch—the outcome of this fight could not be predicted until the very end.

Thick, oppressive Demon Yuan radiated from Di Xiao’s body, making his surroundings pitch dark; corrupt energies permeated and quietly spread outward.

Yang Kai, however, radiated like a burning sun; True Yang Yuan Qi surrounded him, warding off the assault of Di Xiao’s Demon Yuan. The two antagonistic energies collided, crackling audibly.

Both had pushed their power to the utmost—equally matched, neither dared be careless, and neither would show mercy.

A long, ear-splitting howl rose.

A world-shaking murderous qi surged forth. Yang Kai, heart consumed by killing intent, roared to the sky, abandoning everything; his mind held only the will to annihilate his foe.

True Yang Yuan Qi expanded frantically, instantly suppressing the opponent’s Demon Yuan.

Di Xiao’s face changed; he did not dare slacken. His body shifted and he appeared before Yang Kai, his palm filled with the aura of death as it bore down upon Yang Kai’s head.

The ground turned to powder in an instant. Yang Kai narrowly evaded, his hands drawing on True Yuan as well; streams of pure True Yuan suddenly assaulted Di Xiao.

There was no flashy flourish—both combatants laid bare their full repertoire; like water and fire, they clashed irreconcilably.

Di Xiao’s realm of cultivation exceeded Yang Kai by two minor stages, yet his Demon Yuan was countered by Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi. Even when exerting his full ten parts of strength, he could only achieve eight in effect, which enraged him.

Their fighting grew ever fiercer; the unleashed energies became chaotic, masking both their forms and their auras.

The onlookers in the stands could only make out blurred silhouettes and could not discern the true state of the conflict.

A fight to the death!

Blood spat continuously across the field, interspersed with explosions and muffled groans. Both Yang Kai and Di Xiao had gone utterly mad—this brutal form of combat left every spectator chilled and secretly anguished.

All manner of exquisite demonic martial techniques flowed from Di Xiao’s hands, each strike causing Yang Kai grievous pain. Yang Kai’s own methods were likewise formidable—the Yang Liquid changed endlessly, and Di Xiao could not guard against it.

The two figures tangled, bombarding each other relentessly with no mercy; light flashed like mountains collapsing, like meteors falling—ferocious momentum that made people dizzy.

Unnoticed, half the Death Arena had been nearly destroyed.

Never had a single battle produced such devastation; every demon watching felt their blood boil, itching to leap down from the stands to join such a fight to the death without regret.

The more Di Xiao fought, the more he trembled—he had never expected this human youth, far below him in realm, to be so formidable; he had never seen a Transcendent who could contend with him.

His killing blows often wounded Yang Kai but could not deliver the finishing strike; Yang Kai’s body was as hard as a rock—beyond what a human should possess.

Even more shocking to Di Xiao was Yang Kai’s recovery and endurance.

They had been fighting for so long, every move and strike given in full. Di Xiao was exhausted—his True Yuan drained, his momentum and strength weaker than at his peak.

But this human never weakened; from beginning to end he maintained peak condition, growing stronger as he was struck.

It was as if his body held inexhaustible, ever‑renewing True Yuan!

The wounds inflicted only made him more savage.

And during the fight Di Xiao discovered something that filled him with dread.

Yang Kai’s wounds were healing visibly to the naked eye; the dense cuts earlier made by the Wind Blade had now all vanished.

Healing in the middle of battle—what did that mean?

Di Xiao had never seen Yang Kai take any pills, and there simply was no time for him to have done so.

For the first time he realized an oddity: a person who could not only contend with a prodigy like himself but exceed him.

The discovery struck Di Xiao hard; his mood turned complicated in an instant.

He was elite among the demonkind: in only eighty years he’d reached the peak of Third Stage Transcendent, with prospects to reach the Saint Realm before a hundred years old.

Reaching the Saint Realm by a hundred years was exceedingly rare across the continent.

Some powerful factions trained elites who became Transcendent at a young age, but after that realm most people advanced slowly, seldom breaking to the Saint Realm before a hundred.

But Di Xiao had that potential; Gou Qiong had high hopes for him, providing excellent cultivation conditions and abundant resources.

Di Xiao had long been proud, believing one day he would become the foremost below the Demon Lord, perhaps even equal to the Demon Lord.

Yet now he was dealt a crushing blow—according to Gou Chi’s words, this human youth before him was only twenty-five or twenty-six.

Were those extra decades of his cultivation all for nothing?
