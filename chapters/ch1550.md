## Chapter 1550 — Echoes Across the Distance

This method of Pill-refinement stirred Yang Kai's heart to its depths.

Previously, the Pills he refined were of low grade; materials were easy to find, and one portion of material could produce one Pill without issue.

With the Lingxiao Sect as his backing, Yang Kai had no worries about sourcing materials.

But now that he was a Void King-Grade alchemist, the materials for refining Pills were not only extremely precious and hard to find, they also required things like a Pill Guide; even with the Lingxiao Sect he could not locate large quantities of them.

If he could use one portion of material to refine more than a single Spiritual Pill, it would be an enormous profit for him.

This matter was not urgent; he had only just been promoted to Void King-Grade alchemist and still needed to amass much experience. Only when his experience refining Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills reached a certain threshold could he probe deeper techniques.

……

Half a month later, Yang Kai returned to Lushui City.

He did not find Su Yan on this trip, and he did not intend to linger on this cultivation star; he needed to return to Tongxuan Continent as soon as possible to move his relatives and friends to Dark Star and provide them with better cultivation conditions and resources.

Arriving at the inn where Qian Tong and the others had lived, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and swept through; he could not help but look astonished.

Qian Tong and the others were no longer there.

This unexpected discovery made his heart skip a beat; he wondered whether Qian Tong and the others had encountered some misfortune, after all when he left that day they had arranged to meet here.

Where could they have gone?

Yang Kai frowned, took out the Transmission Compass, and poured his Divine Sense into it.

Moments later the compass lit up. A fluctuation of Divine Sense rolled out from inside, and Yang Kai quickly sank into his mind to probe.

After glimpsing the message Qian Tong had sent to him, Yang Kai was utterly astonished.

They had not met with misfortune; on the contrary, they were living well and had already become Honored Guest elders of Lushui City.

This outcome greatly surprised Yang Kai.

He put the compass away and leapt straight out of the inn, heading for a building in the center of Lushui City.

By the time he arrived, Qian Tong and the others were already waiting to greet him with smiles.

They had not asked what Yang Kai had been doing for months; they welcomed him into the building with great warmth, served him tea, and then began to explain.

It turned out that shortly after Yang Kai had left that day, the city lord of Lushui City personally came to visit Qian Tong and the others.

After all, an ensemble of five experts united at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could not be ignored even on this Cuiwei Star. Besides the city lord and deputy city lord, this small city had no other Third Stage experts.

When Qian Tong and the others suddenly appeared here, the city lord grew suspicious, unsure of their intentions. Driven by caution, he came to inquire into their purpose.

Upon learning that Qian Tong and the others were not natives of Cuiwei Star but had simply come to participate in the Blood Prison Trial, the city lord breathed a sigh of relief.

He immediately tried to win them over and invited Qian Tong and the others to serve as elders of Lushui City!

At first they did not intend to accept; to them Cuiwei Star was merely a place to break through and advance, and they planned to return to Dark Star later—there was no need to serve as elders of a city here.

Hastily agreeing would have been irresponsible.

But when the city lord outlined the advantages and informed them that he himself would participate in the Blood Prison Trial so they could assist one another, Qian Tong and the others considered it and then agreed.

However, they did not take the elder positions; they only agreed to be leisurely Honored Guests.

They had already informed the city lord that after the Blood Prison Trial they would leave.

The city lord gladly consented.

That was why they did not stay at the inn but were lodged in places arranged for them by the city lord.

"We are after all outsiders; this city lord is wary of us and courting us makes sense. But since he is a native of Cuiwei Star and probably knows more about the Blood Prison Trial than we do, allying with him is mutually beneficial," Qian Tong said leisurely.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded. "That is fine; having a local look after things at least saves us the trouble of gathering intelligence. You seniors can handle things as you see fit, but… be careful not to be schemed against by the city lord of Lushui City—people hide their true hearts."

Qian Tong and the others laughed loudly.

Mo Yu said, "Sect Master Yang, rest assured. That city lord is shrewd, but from my interactions he is not malicious; he should know his limits. Besides, even if he wished to scheme, he is but one man—we are not afraid."

"Then this junior worries too much," Yang Kai nodded. "Well, since you seniors are safe here, I can leave at ease."

"How long will you be gone?" Qian Tong asked solemnly as he looked at him.

"I don't know. Short term, a year or two; long term, three or four years. Perhaps I can return before the Blood Prison Trial to see the spectacle," Yang Kai grinned.

"That would be best. If you accompany us, the trial will surely be much safer," Qian Tong's spirit brightened—he obviously had great confidence in Yang Kai's strength.

The others also looked at Yang Kai with eager expressions, as if they could not wait for him to go and return.

Yang Kai smiled and then looked toward Qian Yue. "Will you come with me back to Tongxuan Continent, or stay here?"

Qian Yue's face showed hesitation.

She truly did not know what choice to make.

Tongxuan Continent was her and Yang Kai's homeland; of course she felt nostalgic. Having been forced to leave back then, now given the chance to return, she naturally wanted to revisit the land where she grew up.

But…

The scenery might be the same, but the land would have long since changed.

Everything related to the Ice Sect should have long ceased to exist. Perhaps the people there never even knew that an Ice Sect had once stood proudly upon that vast frozen plain.

"I'll stay." Qian Yue's puzzled, beautiful eyes gradually grew resolute as she made her decision. "Those connected to me should be in the Star Domain. If I go back it will only increase my sorrow; staying here I can continue to gather information—perhaps… during this time I can learn something."

Yang Kai nodded slowly and did not try to persuade her.

Her decision was understandable.

"Then Qian Yue is entrusted to you seniors to take good care of," Yang Kai said, looking at Qian Tong and the others.

"Don't worry; with us around no one dares harm her, hehe. Void King Realm experts are rare anywhere," Qian Tong chuckled. Under the Void King Realm, they were the strongest. The five of them together—few would dare cause trouble.

"No more from Mo this time; Sect Master Yang, have a safe journey—go and return soon!" Mo Yu said solemnly.

"Sect Master, be careful on the road," Yang Xiuzhu also watched Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded.

He did not linger long in Lushui City. After confirming Qian Tong and the others were safe, he set out the next day, embarking on the journey back to his homeland.

The Star Shuttle flew out of Cuiwei Star. The Warship was released from the Xuan Realm Pearl, and once the disciples were ready, the Warship sped into the Starry Sky.

Back then, Yang Kai had been full of hot-blooded passion. With only the cultivation of the Saint Realm, he had charged into the Star Domain. It had been several decades since parting from those old friends, and he had no idea how they had fared through the years, or what changes might have befallen them.

Yang Kai's emotions surged; a certain homesick apprehension suddenly arose within him.

As time passed that feeling only grew stronger.

He had the warship retrace the path he had once taken, feeling the shifts in his state of mind and allowing the sweet, sour, bitter, and salty from deep within to condense and settle.

His state of mind became more solid without him noticing.

Suddenly looking back, he was no longer the cocky youth of old.

Now he possessed formidable power at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—an unbeatable existence beneath the Void King Realm, leading the Lingxiao Sect, second to none on Dark Star!

He straightened his spine like a spear, his expression proud and resolute.

Idle for a moment as if sensing something, he turned his head in a direction and his Divine Sense streamed forth.

A scene of breathtaking beauty entered his view.

One massive star after another, each filled with different elemental energies, circled in a certain region of the Starry Sky.

At their center, in that patch of void, something faintly seemed to be calling to Yang Kai.

Even though he was millions of miles away, he felt the response.

The Chaos Abyss!

It had already reached here. Yang Kai came back to his senses and realized that, soundlessly, he had drifted in the current of time and forgotten how it had passed.

This had been his first stop when he initially entered the Star Domain.

It was the most dangerous and unpredictable region of the Star Domain; in that seemingly calm and beautiful spot lurked dangers impossible for mortal force to counter.

The chaos storm was countless times more terrifying than a Star Domain storm; it could swallow warships.

Yang Kai had once been swallowed by the chaos storm and cast down to the Floating Continent, where he had met the Ghost Ancestor and other experts and learned of the Star Domain's marvels.

Back then he had been ignorant of its mysteries; now, with greater strength and broader horizons, he understood some of the secrets.

That terrifyingly potent energy converged to compress an entire space, rendering it undetectable—while the eruption of the chaotic storm served as the very key to open the door to that space.

At the very heart of the Chaos Abyss, a small world lay hidden!

That was the Floating Continent.

When Yang Kai had left the Floating Continent with the Ghost Ancestor and the others, he had left a strand of his Divine Sense there, placing it at the continent's underground center.

There lay an anomalously vast accumulation of energy; Yang Kai suspected it to be the origin of the Floating Continent.

At that time his strength was too low to act rashly.

Now passing by, that strand of Divine Sense immediately established contact with him, as if calling him to enter.

Yang Kai did not respond.

Although his strength now was wholly different from back then, he was not arrogant enough to attempt refining that mass of energy. If the Stellar Origin could be so easily refined, the Ghost Ancestor would not have been trapped within it for two thousand years.

He still needed to wait; when his strength grew greater he would attempt it.

The Warship did not slow; it soon left the Chaos Abyss behind and sped toward the location of Tongxuan Continent.
