## Chapter 2264 — Blessed Land and Cave Heaven

In less than half a cup of tea’s time, the sea of dense Spiritual Qi covered tens of thousands of li in every direction. Martial artists within it could barely see, and even Fenglin City, two thousand li away, benefited greatly. Countless martial artists rushed to the city walls, gazing out with excitement, arms outstretched to embrace the surging Spiritual Qi.

Boom boom boom…

The sound of invisible shackles breaking suddenly echoed from every corner of Fenglin City. These strange noises came from within the martial artists themselves, making their whole bodies tremble and their expressions turn odd.

“I… I actually advanced! I broke through to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm!”

“Wuwuwu… To touch the bottleneck of the Origin Returning Realm in my lifetime—I can die without regret.”

“Hahahaha! I truly am a peerless genius, breaking through three Stages in an instant, straight to the Divine Roaming Realm. I am invincible!”

One after another, voices of joy rang out. In this unbelievably dense sea of Spiritual Qi, martial artists kept breaking through their own realms, climbing to higher stages of the Martial Dao.

There was little commotion when breaking through Stages, but when breaking through Realms, one would receive the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy.

Thus, the sky above Fenglin City quickly darkened. Darkness that devoured all light shrouded the city as if the end had come. Next, clouds gathered and energy swirled, and bolts of heaven’s might struck down, pouring into those breaking through Realms, cleansing their souls and bodies.

Fenglin City was in an uproar.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai and the others outside the city at the sealed land benefited even more.

Each Dao Origin Realm cultivator stood still, eyes closed, feeling the density of the surrounding Spiritual Qi, opening their hearts to absorb it. There was no need to circulate their cultivation; just standing there, the omnipresent Spiritual Qi poured into their bodies, making them feel indescribably comfortable.

Cracking sounds came from within Yang Kai as well, his expression shifting from odd to excited.

“Brother Yang…” Qin Chaoyang suddenly called out with difficulty.

“What is it?” Yang Kai turned to look at Qin Chaoyang.

“I can’t hold on any longer…” Qin Chaoyang’s face was strained, as if constipated for days. He glanced at Yang Kai and said, “I think I need to find a place… to focus and break through!”

Yang Kai’s brows rose, then he beamed. “Then I must congratulate the Qin Family Head.”

Qin Chaoyang was already old, and had shown no signs of breaking through before. But now, with the impact of this sea of Spiritual Qi, he suddenly had an opportunity—this was his personal fortune.

Without this chance, with Qin Chaoyang’s talent and age, he might never have touched the threshold of the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. If he could break through this time, it would be a great blessing for the Qin Family and all of Fenglin City.

Qin Chaoyang smiled bitterly. “The timing is bad. The situation is chaotic. I must ask Brother Yang to guard me for a while!”

“No problem!” Yang Kai agreed readily. Looking around, he saw many martial artists showing excitement, their Origin Qi surging as if they too were about to break through.

“Let’s go, to the source!” Yang Kai grabbed Qin Chaoyang and dashed forward.

There were too many people here, all Dao Origin Realm. The shockwaves from their breakthroughs would be chaotic. Since Qin Chaoyang was showing signs of breaking through, he couldn’t waste the chance.

So he decided to enter the tiger’s den.

“The source!” Qin Chaoyang’s eyes narrowed, quickly understanding where Yang Kai meant.

Yang Kai was dragging him toward the giant pit, braving the endless surge of Spiritual Qi, diving straight down.

As it turned out, Yang Kai’s decision was right. The deeper they went, the purer and denser the Spiritual Qi became. What had seemed astonishing above was nothing compared to what they found below.

With such a vast sea of Spiritual Qi, Qin Chaoyang felt it would be impossible to fail his breakthrough. He grew excited, his face glowing as if he’d become decades younger.

The two of them plunged downward, falling over a thousand zhang before reaching the ground.

The underground was the same as above, shrouded in unimaginable Spiritual Qi. Being inside felt like soaking in water.

Only, this water was not ordinary water, but spiritual liquid.

Yang Kai didn’t stop; he picked a direction and continued forward.

After a long while, he finally stopped, looked around, and said, “Family Head Qin, break through here. No one should come for a while.”

Everyone was busy absorbing pure Spiritual Qi to prepare for breakthroughs—no one had the mind to explore. So Yang Kai’s words made sense.

Qin Chaoyang really couldn’t hold on. He nodded, sat cross-legged, formed hand seals, and soon entered a meditative state.

With a wave of Yang Kai’s hand, three beautiful figures appeared before him.

“Sir… what is this place?” Zhang Ruoxi, upon appearing, immediately sensed the difference, covered her lips in shock, and asked.

Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes widened as she trembled, “Yang… Yang Kai, did you barge into some great sect’s blessed land and cave heaven?”

Liu Yan’s beautiful eyes sparkled, her lips curled in a smile, but she said nothing.

Yang Kai laughed. “Of course not.”

“Then this Spiritual Qi…” Hua Qingsi was utterly shocked.

“How does it compare to the Star God Palace’s Sacred Land?” Yang Kai asked with interest.

“Not inferior!” Hua Qingsi pondered, then said, “The forbidden lands of the Palace are divided into Heaven, Earth, and Human grades. With my cultivation, I’ve only entered the Earth-Grade Sacred Land, and that cost a lot of sect contribution points. The Spiritual Qi here is at least as good as the Earth-Grade!”

“What about the Heaven-Grade?” Yang Kai raised his brows.

“I don’t know!” Hua Qingsi shook her head bitterly. “That’s for Emperor Realm masters. I’m not qualified.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“What is this place, really? How can there be such dense Spiritual Qi?” Hua Qingsi asked again.

“It’s the sealed land you visited last time. No one knows what’s down here, but suddenly a lot of earth and mineral veins appeared…”

Hua Qingsi was stunned.

It was precisely during her last visit to the sealed land that she lost her freedom, captured by Yang Kai and brought into the Small Xuan Realm, where he left a Soul Brand upon her.

But because of that, she obtained a Supreme Mystic Pill, greatly increasing her chances of advancing to the Emperor Realm.

Gains and losses—no one could say for sure. In any case, Hua Qingsi herself didn’t really mind her current situation, and her attitude toward Yang Kai grew warmer.

“Enough talk. This is too good a chance to waste. Hurry and meditate, absorb as much Spiritual Qi as you can.”

Hua Qingsi and Zhang Ruoxi nodded, quickly found places to sit cross-legged, and began cultivating, absorbing the Spiritual Qi.

Hua Qingsi was an elite disciple of Star God Palace, with powerful Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivation. Though she’d suffered setbacks with Yang Kai, she was far from weak. Now, as she circulated her profound arts, her delicate body became a bottomless pit, endlessly drawing in Spiritual Qi.

Yang Kai watched in amazement, secretly admiring the Star God Palace’s profound arts.

Next, something even more surprising happened.

Not far away, Zhang Ruoxi’s body began to emit a whooshing sound like a gale. As this strange sound continued, her delicate body also became a bottomless pit, absorbing even more surging Spiritual Qi.

Zhang Ruoxi’s cultivation rose at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Crack…

A strange sound from the soul suddenly rang out, and an invisible wave of energy spread from Zhang Ruoxi, a powerful field instantly filling the area.

“This…” Yang Kai’s eyes nearly popped out.

Ever since Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline awakened, her cultivation speed had soared. The denser the Spiritual Qi, the more obvious the effect. She seemed to have no bottlenecks—once her power accumulated, she broke through naturally, even her Shi reaching perfection without pause.

The scene before him was Zhang Ruoxi successfully breaking through to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

Yang Kai truly didn’t know what was up with this girl’s body or her bloodline’s mysteries, but there was no denying that this underground place was perfect for her cultivation.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but imagine—if Zhang Ruoxi trained for a few years in the Heaven-Grade Sacred Land of Star God Palace, what would happen?

She might even reach the Emperor Realm directly!

“Master, you seem about to break through too!” Liu Yan looked at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes bright.

Her cultivation was strong now, so she could sense the fluctuations in Yang Kai’s aura.

Yang Kai nodded. “I’ll have to trouble you to guard me here.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai took out the Xuan Realm Pearl, formed a seal, and tapped it. Instantly, the Xuan Realm Pearl opened an invisible gap, and a huge suction force drew in the surrounding Spiritual Qi. The spiritual liquid surged like rivers flowing to the sea—a spectacular sight.

He tossed the Xuan Realm Pearl to Liu Yan. “Find a place to hide. There are still a lot of people here.”

Liu Yan nodded, took the Xuan Realm Pearl, and vanished in a flash, hiding who knows where.

But as she left, Yang Kai noticed a trace of envy in her eyes as she looked at everyone.

After all, everyone could benefit from this opportunity—except her. Naturally, she felt a bit down.
