## Chapter 1303 — Thunder Pool Thunder Liquid

Just as Wang Yuhan's eyes hungrily fixed on Yang Kai's shield Secret Treasure, the Silver Night Thunder Beast gave a low snarl, as if its previous blow had failed to finish the deed and now it seethed with rage; it split its attention, devoting half its strength to dealing with Shen Shitao and the others while the other half bore down on Yang Kai, twin-horned lightning flickering above its head, maw agape, thunder rolling and crackling.

Shen Shitao and the others were overjoyed; the pressure on their side had suddenly eased. The attacks that had nearly suffocated them were now largely shouldered off by Yang Kai. The three exchanged a look and did not waste his effort — Shen Shitao used the Nine Palace Sky-Net Umbrella to maintain defense, while Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei both invoked their offensive Secret Treasures, unleashing their devices' power to batter the sealing formation that trapped them.

For a time the vicinity of the Thunder Pool erupted into chaos, streams of Saint Yuan exploding ferociously as numerous Secret Treasures revealed their potency.

Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei held some standing in the Jidao Sect, so their Secret Treasures were no trifles; while they lacked Upper-Level Origin-Grade devices, they could boast a possession or two of Lower-Level Origin-Grade quality. Pushing themselves to the limit, the sealing layer began to tremble and falter in a remarkably short span.

Seeing this, the two knew victory or defeat hinged on this very strike and dared not hold back, unleashing everything they had. Lü Ying, apparently encouraged, likewise erupted her full strength.

Yang Kai, sheltered by a Purple Shield, need not fear the beast's ranged assaults. Having drawn most of the creature's attention, he poured the Hundred Mountains Painting's might into the fray, sending Saint Yuan blasts — waning as they went — into those illusory mountain peaks.

With coordinated inside-and-out efforts, in less than ten breaths the lightning sealing formation that had left Shen Shitao and the others helpless visibly dimmed and began to spider-crack, emitting crisp snapping sounds as if at any moment it might shatter.

Seeing this, Wang Yuhan realized it was the perfect moment to seize the spotlight. He gave his wrist a flick, and a cyan longsword shimmering with spiritual light appeared in his hand. Raising it upright before him, he bit the tip of his tongue and sprayed a mist of blood over the blade. In an instant, the sword began to tremble and hum violently, as though infused with life itself and struggling to break free from his grasp.

After expelling that blood mist, a strange flush crossed Wang Yuhan's face — the technique he was about to use would cost him.

As the sword hummed, Wang Yuhan's aura surged wildly. With a shake the sword released a banner-like blade-radiance that shot straight for the sealing formation.

The sword-radiance howled, enveloping Wang Yuhan himself; there was the faint flavor of man-and-sword becoming one. In an instant it reached the sealing field, and upon contact countless fine lightning arcs birthed themselves from the formation to pester the blade-radiance.

A cold snort rang out, and as the sword vibrated violently, the sword light clashed head-on with the thunderlight. For a moment, the two forces were locked in stalemate — two utterly different elemental energies colliding and devouring one another, filling the air with a grating metallic screech that set one’s teeth on edge.

The stalemate lasted only a moment. Wang Yuhan suddenly roared, "Break for me!"

As his words fell, the sword light suddenly shot forth, piercing the air above the barrier and tearing open a massive hole. The thunderlight flickered several times, accompanied by a series of sharp cracking sounds — the restriction enveloping the Thunder Pool was finally and completely shattered.

From the moment Yang Kai intervened until now, not even twenty breaths had passed.

Partly this was because Yang Kai would not waste time and pushed himself fully, and partly because Shen Shitao and the others were not ordinary Saint King Realm fighters; each was an elite of their sect, and the vigor and refinement of their Saint Yuan far outstripped common cultivators of the same rank.

Moreover, the sealing formation had been created by the Silver Night Thunder Beast itself. Though it somehow knew the method to set it, it evidently did not grasp the deeper subtleties needed to manipulate the formation's changes, and thus could not bring out its full power; otherwise even with united effort the group would have needed far greater exertion to truly crack it.

The instant the formation collapsed, the Shen siblings leapt straight out, unwilling to linger another moment.

They were visibly shaken.

Wang Yuhan laughed boisterously as he descended, face full of pride; the cyan longsword in his hand flickered and was swallowed back into him, and he struck a pose of inscrutable mystery, seemingly waiting for others' praise.

Shen Fanlei looked at him with admiration and said sincerely, "Senior Brother, you're amazing!"

With his junior's cooperation, Wang Yuhan was even happier; he offered a few humble words outwardly while his eyes kept glancing toward Yang Kai, a faint hint of provocation in them.

"Isn't it premature to celebrate?" Shen Shitao dampened Wang Yuhan's spirits with a cold splash of reality, her lovely eyes fixed gravely on the Silver Night Thunder Beast raging in midair.

With the formation broken, the beast's yao qi roared into the heavens; the patch of azure cloud above likewise exuded terrifying pressure that echoed and answered the yao qi, a fearsome sight.

Wang Yuhan's face twitched and he said brazenly, "Junior Sister, rest assured. Earlier we were trapped in the formation and couldn't fight at full strength. Now we've broken free; we won't give it another chance. Junior Brother, come test your skill with me!"

"Yes!" Shen Fanlei, eager for a fight, nodded emphatically without hesitation.

Before Shen Shitao could protest, the two Jidao Sect brothers charged forward.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow but didn't bother to stop them. He had come for Lü Ying's aid and because Yang Yan needed the Thunder Pool's Thunder Liquid; whether the others lived or died was not his concern.

Wang Yuhan's recklessness suggested he might be dull-headed; to face an Origin Returning Realm-level beast so lightly was foolish. From his demeanor it seemed he was the sort who had long secluded within his sect, cultivating in peace with little actual combat.

Such cultivators often possess solid rank but, in real battle, lack the killing and survival instincts — they cannot adapt on the fly and are easily fooled by surface appearances.

Yang Kai thought the two would surely pay dearly for their arrogance.

To his surprise, however, Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei fought with method and precision when they met the Silver Night Thunder Beast; they were not the inexperienced hermit-cultivators he had imagined.

Their combat experience was ample, and their adaptability remarkable. Though they could not deal the beast a decisive blow, their movements were nimble; their use of Secret Treasures and execution of Martial Skills were all well-timed.

The Silver Night Thunder Beast found itself unable to deal effectively with the two of them.

Yang Kai's expression shifted as realization dawned; if they dared press forward like this, they must have some confidence behind them.

Shen Shitao and Lü Ying, having watched worriedly for a time, relaxed and a strange gleam flashed in both their eyes — the thought of slaughtering the beast and seizing its core had arisen.

The Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast's inner core — and specifically the Silver Night Thunder Beast's lightning-core — was priceless; for pill refinement or forging, many would pay handsomely. Moreover, the beast's other body materials were clearly valuable as well.

Perhaps because they had been trapped by the formation before, Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei had been stung into fury; now freed they fought with ruthless ferocity. The two acted seamlessly as attack and defense, nearly toying with the beast. Without the formation as support, the silver beast had slipped into the disadvantage in combat; if not for the palm-sized scales shielding its hide it likely would have been wounded. Elated, the two pressed their assault mercilessly.

Yang Kai paid no mind to their greed; he signaled Yang Yan with a glance. Yang Yan understood, nodded slightly, and hurried to the Thunder Pool with a specially made vessel, channeling Saint Yuan into it and beginning to collect the pool's Thunder Liquid.

The Thunder Pool was not large — roughly thirty zhang across — but seemed bottomless; the liquid within was no common water but Thunder Liquid laced with vast quantities of lightning energy.

Such Thunder Pools can be manmade: place things that attract heavenly lightning, set up formations to preserve the storm force, and over decades or centuries a nascent pool forms. Toss in lightning-attributed medicinal materials and the pool matures faster.

Some Thunder Pools are naturally formed.

These pools are rare but invaluable to practitioners of lightning-attributed cultivation or Martial Skills. The Thunder Pool in Zangxiong Valley once belonged to the Guyang Sect, and many cultivators knew of its existence; otherwise Shen Shitao and the others would not have come here.

They had not expected a Silver Night Thunder Beast to dwell at the pool's bottom, nor that it would appear while Shen Fanlei practiced a secret technique. Had the beast been a long-established Ninth-Tier, their trouble would have been grave.

Even so, their escape owed everything to Yang Kai's timely arrival.

Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei tangled the beast long enough for Yang Yan to harvest the Thunder Liquid. Yang Kai was pleased; whether the four would remain to finish the beast off after the collection was none of his concern.

He only wished to get as far from this trouble as possible.

The duel overhead intensified; the Silver Night Thunder Beast roared and spat spheres of lightning that detonated beside Shen Fanlei and Wang Yuhan. Though they were not injured, the explosions forced them into a flurry of defensive measures.

The beast then hung motionless in midair, massive head raised, emitting a continuous howl laced with indescribable fury.
