## Chapter 1524 — You Need Not Know

No organization would display such an extreme imbalance of numbers; low-tier warriors, though weak in strength, are every Sect's hope for the future. Thus, whether it is the Battle Sky Alliance's Leitai Sect or Yingyue Hall's Liuli Sect, the rank-and-file are always vast in number while the upper echelons are few.

But at Star Emperor Mountain the situation is reversed.

The cause lies in the strictness of their admissions.

The threshold to be accepted into Star Emperor Mountain is unimaginably high: one must possess the finest talent, and there are age limits. Most are brought to Star Emperor Mountain before they are ten years old, an age most suitable for instilling certain ideas, which is why the people of Star Emperor Mountain revere the Great Emperor.

This is because, during their upbringing, the elder generation taught them this belief.

Yet once admitted to Star Emperor Mountain, one enjoys the finest cultivation environment and the most abundant cultivation resources.

Star Emperor Mountain will expend the Sect's resources to smooth the path for a disciple's cultivation.

They must break through to the Origin Returning Realm before forty years old!

If they cannot, their cultivation will be stripped and they will be expelled from Star Emperor Mountain.

The rule is cruel, and its effects are decisive.

As a result, cultivators who enter Star Emperor Mountain advance at astonishing speed, which is why so many reach the Origin Returning Realm.

Take rising stars of Dark Star such as Qu Changfeng, Fang Tianzhong, and Wei Guchang—none of them failed to break through around that age; even Yang Kai was no exception.

Moreover, once a cultivator's strength deepens, the aging of the face slows almost to a standstill, which is why everyone appears youthful.

Yang Kai entered Lingxiao Pavilion at thirteen; looking back now, two or three decades have already passed.

Even now he is only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

It can be said that any cultivator from Star Emperor Mountain, plucked at random, is someone who can stand shoulder to shoulder with Qu Changfeng, Fang Tianzhong, and the like.

Furthermore, because Star Emperor Mountain's teachings descend from antiquity and it possesses countless supreme cultivation methods and secret arts, its disciples' combat power at the same rank is generally a cut above.

Once a disciple breaks through to the Origin Returning Realm before forty, they may descend the mountain to temper their heart and experience the world; naturally, they do so under a hidden name.

A thousand years ago the reason Guyang Sect was wiped out overnight by Star Emperor Mountain was that it was believed a disciple who had gone down the mountain to temper himself had been killed by Guyang Sect.

For all these reasons, Star Emperor Mountain has an unusually large number of high-level cultivators, while low-level disciples are scarce.

Among those low-level disciples their cultivation is uneven, yet each looks green and immature. The youngest, having only joined Star Emperor Mountain the year before last at merely about eleven years old, already possesses the Separation and Union Realm; one step beyond that is the True Yuan Realm.

This would be unimaginable in any Sect; perhaps the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect could produce such cases, but they would be few and far between, whereas at Star Emperor Mountain it is commonplace.

At that age Yang Kai had not yet stepped onto the Martial Dao...

Now, two hundred people had gathered on Kaiyun Peak. Though there were many, it was silent as a grave; everyone seemed to be quietly waiting for something, faces solemn.

Leading the group were Yang Xiuzhu and two others.

As they waited, the three exchanged glances and transmitted divine sense, as if consulting on something.

After a long while, someone in the crowd finally asked, "Brother Yang, didn't you say the Sect Master had something important to announce? Why have we waited here for half a day with no sign of the him? I must return to seclude myself and refine my Jingtao Technique; I cannot be delayed!"

"Yes, Brother Yang, you said the leader had something to tell us. I have only just emerged from my cavern; my batch of Dragon Essence Pills is almost ready—if delayed further, will you compensate my loss?" another old matron called impatiently.

With those two taking the lead, others began to clamour.

Most of these people had spent years secluded in their caverns, either cultivating secret methods or studying forging and alchemy; they rarely ventured out and seldom did so in such numbers.

Two days ago Yang Xiuzhu, Lin Yurao and Chu Hanyi sent word together that the Sect Master had summoned them to discuss matters.

Although the three were not greatly favoured within the sect, their reputations remained, and their joint summons naturally compelled most not to ignore it; they all came out of seclusion to gather here.

They had waited a long time with no sign of the leader; no wonder there were complaints.

"Everyone, calm yourselves and wait a little longer!" Yang Xiuzhu shouted, looking toward the horizon, but still did not see what he expected.

"How much longer?" the matron snapped, stamping her staff into the ground. "I'll be frank: I'm giving you face—I'll wait another incense-stick's time. If the Sect Master does not appear after that, I'll leave; don't say I didn't warn you."

"That's right!" someone agreed; but soon another voice added in puzzlement, "Brother Yang, since when have you become so close to the Sect Master that his orders come through you? Isn't this usually Elder Bai's duty?"

He vaguely remembered that Yang Xiuzhu was not particularly close to the Sect Master.

"Yang Xiuzhu, what audacity!" a furious voice suddenly came from afar, and with it a beam of red light shot over; after a moment the radiance settled before the crowd, revealing three silhouettes.

"Bai Xi!" Yang Xiuzhu narrowed his eyes, a trace of apprehension in his gaze as he looked toward the newcomers.

The figure was an old man in a brown robe with graying hair, whose stern bearing needed no anger to command respect. The great aura and Saint Yuan fluctuations on him betrayed that he was at the pinnacle of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

If Yang Kai had been here, he would surely have recognized him.

The old fellow was none other than the man who had attacked him that day on Fallen Emperor Mountains with an Extinction Thunder Bead.

"Elder Bai!" At his appearance many in the crowd bowed.

Bai Xi held the post of Great Elder at Star Emperor Mountain; though many matched him in realm, his position was more honoured and he was the Sect Master's confidant, so they naturally greeted him proactively.

But seeing Bai Xi so furious, the crowd was puzzled; they did not know what had angered him.

“Yang Xiuzhu, it’s been only a few months, yet your courage has grown bold indeed! How dare you issue false orders in the Sect Master’s name—what punishment do you think you deserve?” Bai Xi’s expression turned vicious as he glared at Yang Xiuzhu and shouted harshly.

"What? Falsely transmitting the Sect Master's orders?" There were exclamations from the crowd; countless eyes turned to Yang Xiuzhu and the other two, faces full of bewilderment.

Such a thing had never happened at Star Emperor Mountain; fellow disciples there were like brothers and sisters, close as limbs, so disputes and vendettas were rare.

Yet now, why would Yang Xiuzhu willingly commit such a grave transgression and falsely convey the Sect Master's orders?

What is he trying to do?

Bai Xi is a confidant of the Sect Master; if he says it was falsified, he must be right.

“I issued false orders in the Sect Master’s name?” Yang Xiuzhu looked at the aggressive Bai Xi and let out a cold laugh. “This old man wouldn’t dare disregard the ancestral precepts. Within Star Emperor Mountain, the Sect Master stands supreme—of that, I am well aware. But as for those who offend that order, all disciples of the mountain shall join together to punish them!”

"Good that you know!" Bai Xi sneered. "I saw the Sect Master not long ago and rushed here from him. If he had such orders, how could I not know?"

"Because you have no need to know!" Before Yang Xiuzhu could reply, a clear, commanding feminine voice rang out from mid-air.

In an instant a figure flashed; a coldly beautiful woman in palace robes appeared strangely in mid-air, standing aloof, her phoenix-like eyes as cold as blades looking down.

Bai Xi whipped his head around, aghast, exclaiming, "Sect Master Ye Xijun!"

"Senior Sister Ye Xijun!"

"It is Senior Sister Ye? Impossible—wasn't it said that Senior Sister Ye had long since died? Am I growing old and losing my sight?" one man muttered.

"Senior Sister Ye? It's really you, isn't it?" the old matron who had spoken to Yang Xiuzhu pushed through to the front, trembling, staring at Ye Xijun in mid-air, astonished and bewildered.

Ye Xijun looked at her and smiled. "A hundred years without seeing you, Junior Sister Xinlan, you have grown much older!"

Xu Xinlan was shaken, tears in her eyes yet laughing with joy. "Senior Sister Ye, your bearing is more magnificent than before. Junior Sister never imagined that in her lifetime she would still have the fortune to behold Senior Sister's grace!"

“Having been harmed by others, I had no choice but to live in seclusion for a hundred years. I’ve troubled Junior Sister with needless worry,” Ye Xijun said gently.

"Harmed by others? Who would dare harm you!" Xu Xinlan hissed like a venomous snake, spitting malice. Suddenly, as if remembering something, she said in a sullen voice, "Could it be..."

"Yes." Ye Xijun nodded lightly. "I have returned partly to settle past scores, and partly to purge the sect."

“Good!” Xu Xinlan gritted her teeth and hissed, “Count this Junior Sister in! Even if I die, I’ll tear a chunk of flesh from that beast!”

While the two spoke, the more than two hundred cultivators on Kaiyun Peak were turning matters over in their minds.

Though most of these people had been secluded for years in Star Emperor Mountain and had not even heard of Ye Xijun's return, her participation in the Dragon Lair Mountain battle, or her joining Lingxiao Sect, the situation was now clear to them; they were not fools—after a moment's thought they grasped much of the cause and effect.

Even if they could not know everything, they could still make a fairly accurate guess.

To conspire against the former Sect Master, force her from Star Emperor Mountain, and usurp power—such treachery is unforgivable within Star Emperor Mountain.

Moreover, among the more than two hundred present, many had been tipped off by Yang Xiuzhu and knew this drama would unfold today; with Ye Xijun's return they were naturally overjoyed.

In those days they had all, to varying degrees, benefited from Ye Xijun's kindness.

When Ye Xijun had presided over Star Emperor Mountain, their conditions for life and cultivation were much better; since her disappearance their treatment had been reduced somewhat.

Given the contrast, the people naturally hoped for Ye Xijun's restoration to power.

And besides, it would be entirely legitimate!

A hundred years ago Ye Xijun was already the foremost expert on Dark Star; a hundred years on, her strength would only be greater—if she does not assume power, who should?

Even Yang Xiuzhu and the others would be dwarfed in Ye Xijun's presence.
