## Chapter 1400 — I'll Be Right Back

Chang Qi and Hao An's situation was almost identical to Ning Xiangchen's; however, the two had long understood the subtlety and terror of Dragon Lair Mountain's great array, so each took up a position and waited there with calm readiness.

From time to time, some enemy would inexplicably charge before them and be slain.

Yang Yan returned to preside over Dragon Lair Mountain's great array, using the formation's power to split the enemies apart and then guide each one's movements, delivering them to the waiting Chang Qi and Hao An one by one as if it were child's play.

Thus Chang Qi and Hao An's expressions were much more relaxed than Ning Xiangchen's.

As for those of the Saint King Realm, their cultivation was insufficient; once they fell into the formation and had their Saint Yuan's circulation suppressed, they could not hold out more than three breaths against Chang Qi and Hao An. Even those of the same level, First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, merely struggled like trapped beasts. As time passed, one after another the enemies fell at the two men's feet.

The numbers of cultivators from the Xie Family, Haixin Sect, and Liuyun Valley were dwindling at a terrifying pace. Panic spread through their ranks, and the screams that echoed intermittently in their ears turned this place into a living hell, making their hearts tremble with fear. Each of them secretly vowed that if they managed to escape with their lives this time, they would never set foot in Dragon Lair Mountain again.

Xie Li himself had not encountered much danger, but he had led several Saint King Realm followers into an illusion array and could not escape; he was anxious like an ant on a hot pan yet utterly powerless.

The formation Yang Yan had laid down belonged to a realm far beyond what the cultivators of Dark Star could ever comprehend. To trap them with it was effortless—hardly worth the flick of a finger.

To the left of Dragon Lair Mountain, Elder Du of Myriad Beasts Mountain led numerous disciples, cutting through brambles and at last breaking out of the encirclement of countless Fire Spirit Beasts to penetrate into the mountain's interior.

Gazing at the neat rows of exquisite pavilions and the vast stretches of open ground not far off, the survivors from Myriad Beasts Mountain trembled with excitement and mustered their strength to rush toward them.

After a short while they finally reached a place of safety. Looking back with lingering fright, they found that the inexhaustible Fire Spirit Beasts ceased pursuit once they were beyond a certain range and instead dissipated. Everyone could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.

Elder Du sat astride a Green-Eyed Blood Toad. His narrow eyes swept the surroundings; when he saw that only a mere seven or eight had escaped the disaster and were trailing at his side, his heart chilled.

There had been thirty or forty people following him earlier; now there were only this few. Even these seven or eight were all wounded — only two of them were of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. The rest were merely of the Saint King Realm!

What sort of existence was Dragon Lair Mountain? Simply breaking through one checkpoint had cost so many men — what greater perils awaited them next?

At that thought Elder Du's heart pounded and he felt a pull to retreat, but returning the way they had come was impossible; they would surely fall back into the Fire Spirit Beasts' encirclement.

For the moment, the only course was to seize the ringleader first!

Elder Du narrowed his eyes toward the cave where he had earlier sensed many martial auras, a trace of viciousness flashing through his gaze.

But upon looking, Elder Du's face could not help but show mingled astonishment and fury, for not far ahead a tall young man stood there, a mocking smile tugging at his lips as he coldly appraised them.

Whether the man had been there originally or had suddenly appeared, Elder Du had no sense of it. Still, he recognized him — it was the master of Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai, the one who had purchased the Xuan Gold at the auction!

He matched the description in the intelligence: merely a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm!

What delighted Elder Du even more was that the man stood alone, blatantly blocking the way as if a mantis would stop a chariot. Even with heavy losses they still had three Origin Returning Realm cultivators and four or five Saint King Realm, and Elder Du himself was of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — capturing him should be no problem.

The only thing to worry about was whether he had some trick up his sleeve!

Thinking this, Elder Du bellowed angrily, "You brat, dare to oppose Myriad Beasts Mountain — today I will see you die without a grave!"

"What an impertinent boast!" Yang Kai said with a dark laugh. "You have entered my Dragon Lair Mountain — whether you live or die is no longer up to you!"

He did not bother to say more; after speaking he softly called, "Yang Yan!"

No sooner had his words fallen than the scenery changed. The once-present rows of exquisite pavilions vanished in a distortion, replaced by an endless stretch of green grassland.

"An illusion formation?" Elder Du's expression shifted. He had never imagined Dragon Lair Mountain's restrictive arrays would be arranged even in such places. Logically, a sect's main hall would have restrictions spread around its outskirts and even greater power in the innermost layers, while open spaces in the middle were usually left free so the cultivators living there would have room to move; otherwise a disciple might accidentally trigger a formation, and that would be a blunder.

So when they had seen this open ground earlier, Elder Du and the others had rushed forward in gladness.

Who would have thought that the place they assumed safe had also been arrayed?

Dragon Lair Mountain was only a small hillhead; there was no reason to set so many restrictive arrays as if a great enemy were always about to attack. Had they really known they would face such a day?

Little did Elder Du know Yang Yan's thoughts and strangeness. The reason Dragon Lair Mountain's restrictive arrays were so numerous, layered, and nearly without blind spots was entirely because she wanted to awaken the hidden array knowledge and forging knowledge stored in her mind.

Only by continually laying out arrays could Yang Yan glean more mysteries of formations.

In a word, Dragon Lair Mountain's formations could not be measured by ordinary reasoning.

Even after being trapped by the illusion, Elder Du was not overly alarmed, for his strength was considerable. He laughed wildly and snarled, "A mere illusion formation thinks to kill me? You underestimate me!"

"I never said I wanted to kill you with the illusion," Yang Kai said with a sly smile.

"Then what do you intend? If you have means, use them—don't hide them!" Elder Du laughed arrogantly. "Today I shall let you see the gap between you and me."

"Hm, calm yourself — I will be right back!" Yang Kai nodded slightly. After speaking his figure rapidly thinned, most peculiar, and seemed about to vanish from Elder Du's sight.

"Trying to run?" Elder Du flew into a rage, and with a movement of his Divine Sense a scarlet light suddenly shot toward where Yang Kai stood.

But the move was still a bit slow; Yang Kai's figure dispersed into nothing, and the scarlet light flashed past.

Elder Du's face instantly grew ashen with gloom!

He had actually let him get away — this formation was not simple. How had the man slipped from his sight and Divine Sense detection? He had no clue, and what was the point of such theatrics?

A flash of insight struck Elder Du; he turned his head to look beside him and his face went deathly cold.

The two Origin Returning Realm cultivators and the four or five Saint King Realm who had been beside him were now also nowhere to be seen, as if only he alone had been ensnared by the illusion.

Putting together what Yang Kai had said moments ago, Elder Du immediately grasped his intent. Filled with shocked fury, he roared madly, drew out a single-handed axe bristling with murderous qi, funneled his Saint Yuan into it, and slashed viciously at the void, attempting to shatter the illusion.

He had no study in formations and naturally did not know how to dispel the illusion before him, so he could only use the crudest of methods.

The grade of that single-handed axe treasure was certainly not low; it should be an Origin-Grade, Middle-Level Secret Treasure. Although artificers from Dark Star could not forge such items, they could be obtained from certain ruins, so while rare they were not impossible to acquire.

After infusing it with Saint Yuan, the axe discharged a pitch-black giant beam more than ten zhang long, striking the void with a buzzing roar that sounded formidable.

But such an attack was obviously insufficient to destroy the illusion, and moreover the formation was presided over by Yang Yan.

After three or five chops, much Saint Yuan had been consumed with no result. Elder Du's face darkened as he stopped his motion and waited warily.

He believed the enemy would appear again.

Sure enough, after about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, a faint shadow appeared in the void ahead and gradually solidified until Yang Kai's figure manifested.

Elder Du's gaze immediately fixed on his face and clothing, for there were fresh splashes of blood, and from that blood a faint trace of yao qi could be sensed.

As a man of Myriad Beasts Mountain, Elder Du was thoroughly familiar with that scent — it was the blood of a Demonic Beast! And only cultivators from Myriad Beasts Mountain would have a Demonic Beast at their side.

"What have you done to my disciples?" Elder Du asked, his face grim as he looked at Yang Kai.

"Why ask when you know the answer? Since I'm back, how do you think they fared?" Yang Kai sneered. "They were only two of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and four or five of the Saint King Realm. On Dragon Lair Mountain's turf, dealing with them was no trouble for me."

After all, when he had been of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm he could already slay those of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Now with Yang Yan manipulating the formation to assist, having heaven, earth, and advantage on their side, if a mishap still occurred then all those years of cultivation had been wasted.

Though a certain suspicion had been gnawing at him, when Yang Kai admitted it Elder Du ground his teeth and nodded word by word: "Very well, very well — dare to slaughter my disciples, and Myriad Beasts Mountain will be at war with you until death!"

Despite his words, Elder Du's expression calmed.

Seeing this, Yang Kai was surprised; he had not expected that the old man could quell his anger — he seemed to possess commendable temperament and was not a soft target to be toyed with. Yang Kai's vigilance rose, but on the surface he put on an extreme air of arrogance: "What becomes of Myriad Beasts Mountain is none of your concern. But old man, you have no future — for you will die here today!"
