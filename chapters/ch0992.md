## Chapter 992 — Yang Kai, Save Me

Shen Tu glanced at Yang Kai, pondered for a moment, then nodded. “What you said makes sense. Whatever those two sisters are holding must be extraordinary. As long as they find them, there’s no need for the Sword Alliance to clash with Purple Star here… I must say, your way of thinking is a bit different from ordinary people’s.”

Since Liu Shan and the others returned, Yang Kai had been able to deduce near-certainties from various scraps of evidence—something Shen Tu simply could not do.

He genuinely felt a measure of admiration for Yang Kai.

"Shen Tu, we who are stationed in the power chamber are mainly here to assist in supplying the ship's propulsion, right?" Yang Kai suddenly asked an offhand question.

"Yes, why?"

"I have a bad feeling," Yang Kai said, staring at him intently.

Shen Tu's expression changed; the corner of his mouth twitched. "Don't scare me—what do you sense?"

Yang Kai shook his head and gave no answer.

The two instantly fell silent, watching their surroundings in quiet, checking on the movements of the warrior named Ke Meng and staying alert.

After about the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the compass-shaped Secret Treasure Ke Meng used for communication flickered with a trace of light; he hastily poured his divine sense into it and began to communicate.

Moments later Ke Meng put the treasure away, his expression grave as he barked orders: "Speed up, pursue the Sword Alliance's warship—don't let them escape!"

At his words, both Yang Kai and Shen Tu went pale.

"You were right," Shen Tu said, his face dark. "I was feeling uneasy too." He cursed angrily, "You jinx!"

In the next instant, a low hum resounded throughout the massive Saint-Grade warship and its speed suddenly surged, rapidly pursuing a direction in the starry sky.

At the same time, the shackles binding Yang Kai and Shen Tu transmitted an even greater suction force than before, ravenously drawing their strength away.

The pull was roughly twice as strong as earlier; in an instant their internal strength began vanishing twice as fast.

Shen Tu couldn't help but groan, his body trembling; even Yang Kai felt pain radiate through him, and however he circulated his techniques he could not stop his energy from leaking away.

The warriors bound in the power chamber normally only supplemented the ship's propulsion—the primary energy came from the Saint Crystals—but once this great Secret Treasure had some other action, the energy requirement swelled. At that moment, people like Shen Tu and Yang Kai faced disaster.

Their inner strength was siphoned away more violently.

Ke Meng darted through the power chamber, issuing one order after another, his face feral.

The unchecked, frantic draining by the shackles made the already dire situation for the bound warriors in the power chamber even worse.

After the warship accelerated, cries of anguish rose from every direction; now and then one of the weaker fighters foamed at the mouth and collapsed, dead.

They could no longer endure the torment; their strength had been drained dry and they could not withstand it.

Shen Tu grew inwardly alarmed, a bitter expression on his face. He knew his condition wouldn't hold much longer—if his internal energy were truly exhausted, even if he did not die his cultivation would undoubtedly fall.

He cursed silently in his heart, powerless to change his fate.

Stealing a glance at Yang Kai, Shen Tu couldn't help but stare in amazement.

He was shocked to discover that although Yang Kai's face was twisted with pain and his strength kept flowing out in torrents, the energy fluctuations within him showed no sign of weakening; it seemed his body constantly maintained a fullness of Saint Yuan.

This puzzled Shen Tu—he couldn't understand why Yang Kai was so strange.

"Lord, five people have already died," a warrior suddenly reported to Ke Meng.

Ke Meng froze, as if remembering something. He sneered at the bound warriors on the ground. "A bunch of trash—give them some Saint Crystals!"

"Yes!" the warrior answered and hurried to the living, dropping three Saint Crystals in front of each person.

Those dim eyes suddenly shone with the light of a second chance; everyone seized the Saint Crystals before them and began to draw their energy, replenishing what had been consumed.

Shen Tu did the same; his method differed somewhat, and in less than half a tea session he had drained all the energy from the three Saint Crystals, licking his lips as if still wanting more.

That single replenishment at least improved his complexion considerably.

The Upper-Level Saint-Grade warship continued to race through the starry sky at an unimaginable speed—far beyond what a Star Shuttle could match.

Yang Kai sat in the power chamber and watched meteoroids and asteroids streak past like falling stars outside the transparent window; the warship was unbelievably sturdy, plowing through the starry sky and smashing smaller rocks to pieces while remaining unscathed.

About half a day later Ke Meng's face flushed with excitement as he roared, "You Sword Alliance curs, we've finally caught up—let's see where you run now!"

At his shout, Shen Tu and Yang Kai both turned their gazes to the window.

Ahead of them a massive ship similar in size to their own sailed through the starry sky; its hull bore a huge sword-shaped emblem.

That emblem was exactly the same as the one Yang Kai had seen on the clothes of the He Miao sisters.

It was indeed a Sword Alliance warship.

"Heh heh heh—taste the might of my Purple Star warship!" Ke Meng became a different man, feral and crazed, bloodthirsty in his marrow as he barked orders.

With a thunderous noise the hull trembled and a dazzling divine light suddenly shot forth from somewhere within the ship.

The beam was thick and fierce like a fanged serpent, instantly breaking free of spatial constraints, tearing through the starry sky and striking toward the Sword Alliance ship.

All the asteroids in its path turned to dust, instantaneously annihilated.

Yang Kai caught sight of that divine light, and in that instant his face turned ashen.

Even from inside the power chamber he could sense the annihilating might contained within that light.

He had no doubt this beam could level a peak and evaporate a vast lake.

It was truly a heaven-shattering, earth-destroying power.

If such a divine beam struck him, Yang Kai reckoned that even at full strength he would be reduced to ash.

He couldn't help but feel a measure of pity for the Sword Alliance vessel.

But the result surprised him: when the beam hit the Sword Alliance ship a halo suddenly arose from it, like a multicolored bubble that enveloped the ship.

The beam struck that halo and ripples visibly spread across it, racing into the depths of the starry sky.

The Sword Alliance ship merely trembled and remained unharmed.

Ke Meng's excited expression turned suddenly grim; he had not expected his carefully-timed ambush to be so promptly repelled.

At his command the hull trembled again and a second divine beam shot out.

"Damn it!" Shen Tu swore, his face white. The energy he had just replenished was instantly drained dry; he turned and screamed at Yang Kai, "Yang Kai, save me!"

Yang Kai stared at him in surprise, then snapped back to attention.

He had been drawn to the terrifying might of the divine beam and had not noticed the changes around him.

At Shen Tu's shout he realized with a shock that the Saint Crystals neatly arrayed in the power chamber had dimmed greatly after the two beams were fired; the enormous energy within them had been reduced by more than half.

At the same time, the Saint Yuan in their meridians and bodies had been sucked dry by the shackles on their hands and feet—nothing remained!

He suddenly understood: those divine beams required massive energy to form.

The two beams had not only demanded huge reserves from the Saint Crystals in the power chamber but also placed an unimaginable burden on the warriors bound there.

After the two beams struck, half of the fifty or sixty warriors bound there perished in an instant—their lifeforce extinguished, souls dispersed.

The survivors were little more than gasps; if another beam struck, they would surely die.

Shen Tu and Yang Kai were among the luckiest of those left.

Yang Kai quickly detonated a drop of Yang Liquid in his dantian, refilling his body and meridians, and flung the Saint Crystals he had hidden toward Shen Tu.

Shen Tu's eyes brightened; he seized the Saint Crystals eagerly and ravenously drew their energy, his face regaining color.

"They dare to fight back?" Ke Meng shouted.

It seemed that because Purple Star had launched those strikes so brazenly, the Sword Alliance refused to sit still and answered in kind.

A divine beam shot from their side and the Purple Star ship manifested a defensive energy shield.

There was a tremendous boom and the ship shook.

Shen Tu's face went pale once more and he coughed up a mouthful of blood mist.

He had no time even to curse—the firing of beams and the raising of shields each demanded unfathomable energy, and every clash between the two fleets imposed an unimaginable burden on Shen Tu and the others.

"Fire everything—grind them to powder!" Ke Meng howled like a man whose pride had been offended.

"Lord, the crystal cannons can't be used any further. If we continue, the Saint Crystals will be depleted," one warrior warned beside him.

Ke Meng's brow drew into a line and his rage seemed to calm.

He finally realized the problem.

At that moment his compass-like Secret Treasure flashed again; Ke Meng poured his divine sense into it and, after a brief exchange, twisted his lips into a feral smile and waved a huge hand: "Open the bay doors—today we'll let the Sword Alliance fools see our might."

"Yes!"

In the next instant the ship's bay opened and figures of Purple Star warriors emerged, each riding different Secret Treasures, rapidly streaking toward the Sword Alliance.
