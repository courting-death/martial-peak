## Chapter 2436 — Parting Ways

With this in mind, Yang Kai decided not to stop her. Perhaps letting Hua Qingsi act on her own would lead to unexpected gains.

Moreover, Hua Qingsi was quite powerful, and she wielded a five-colored spear, an Imperial Treasure. This Imperial Treasure had once belonged to an expert like Yao Changjun, but she had long since mastered it, and its power was boundless.

Ordinary cultivators were no match for her.

The only thing Hua Qingsi lacked now was a Star Seal! Without a Star Seal, she couldn’t sense the location of the Origin Power and could only search aimlessly.

“Take this with you.” Yang Kai reached out and handed her a Spatial Ring.

Hua Qingsi accepted it, swept her Divine Sense inside, and immediately exclaimed, “So many Source Crystals!”

There was nothing else in the ring—almost all of it was Source Crystals. Though she didn’t count them, there were at least two or three hundred million of them, including many Upper-Level Source Crystals. Besides the Source Crystals, there were also various Spiritual Pills personally refined by Yang Kai.

“If you really can break through your shackles and advance to the Emperor Realm here, Source Crystals are absolutely essential. The Spiritual Qi in the Shattered Star Sea is very thin, so don’t refuse these.” Yang Kai said solemnly.

Clutching the Spatial Ring, Hua Qingsi nodded gently, moved. “Young Master Yang, thank you. You’re the best person to me in this world.”

Although she had originally been forced to follow Yang Kai, and had even been confined in the Small Xuan Realm, over the years, Yang Kai had never done anything to harm her. On the contrary, she had received from him a Supreme Mystic Pill that others could only dream of, laying a solid foundation for her future advancement to the Emperor Realm. She had also obtained a five-colored spear, an Imperial Treasure, from his hands.

Now, Yang Kai had given her two or three hundred million Source Crystals in one go. In this world, who else could treat her so well and give her so many treasures? Whether it was the Supreme Mystic Pill or the five-colored spear, both were treasures that countless experts would fight over. Even her master in the Star God Palace could not do so much for her.

Hua Qingsi was truly moved.

If she really could become an Emperor one day, the person she would need to thank most would be Yang Kai. She had mentioned fate before, and now she thought that meeting Yang Kai was perhaps the greatest fortune of her life. It was indeed a great fortune.

“No need to be so polite, Sister Hua.” Yang Kai smiled slightly, then suddenly remembered something and said, “Don’t move!”

As he spoke, he reached out and touched Hua Qingsi’s forehead.

Although Hua Qingsi didn’t know what he was doing, she didn’t show any intention of defending herself and simply stood there.

After a moment, Yang Kai’s finger touched her forehead. The next instant, Hua Qingsi’s delicate body trembled. Suddenly, she felt as if an invisible shackle had been lifted, and her whole body felt incomparably light.

In that instant, she understood what Yang Kai had done—he had actually removed the Soul Brand imprinted in her Sea of Consciousness!

Back then, when she was confined in the Small Xuan Realm by Yang Kai, she had been forced to open her Sea of Consciousness and let him imprint a Soul Brand. From that moment on, she could no longer resist him and had to obey his every command.

But now, Yang Kai had taken the initiative to remove that brand!

In other words, she was now free. She was no longer bound by Yang Kai.

“Young Master Yang, you…” Hua Qingsi’s beautiful eyes trembled as she looked at him in disbelief.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “If you’re going to break through to the Emperor Realm, you can’t have any distractions.”

Hua Qingsi pressed her red lips together, then suddenly raised her hand and pointed to the sky. “Rest assured, Young Master Yang. In this life, I will never reveal any of your secrets. If I break this oath, may I die from Qi Deviation!”

She knew too many of Yang Kai’s secrets—whether it was the Xuan Realm Pearl, his various trump cards, or the Everlasting Tree and Firmament Tree planted in the medicine garden. If any of these were leaked, Yang Kai would never be able to survive in the Star Realm and would be hunted everywhere he went.

By taking this heart demon oath of her own accord, she was letting Yang Kai know he didn’t need to worry about her leaking anything.

Yang Kai smiled. “If I didn’t trust you, I wouldn’t have removed the brand. Go on, Sister Hua, and take care!”

Hua Qingsi nodded and asked, “If the Shattered Star Sea closes, where should I find you?”

“If you want to find me, go to Thousand Leaves Sect. I’ll definitely visit Thousand Leaves Sect one day.”

Chi Yue, Ai Ou, and the others were all at Thousand Leaves Sect, so no matter what, Yang Kai would go there again.

“Alright, then I’ll wait for you there.” Hua Qingsi nodded, then stepped forward to say a few words to Liu Yan and Zhang Ruoxi before leaping into the starry sky and quickly disappearing from sight.

Watching her leave, Yang Kai let out a gentle breath.

Over the years, Hua Qingsi had helped him a lot. When he imprisoned her back then, he hadn’t meant any harm—she had just seen some of his secrets. He had planned to set her free after advancing to the Emperor Realm, but now he was just doing it a bit earlier.

After spending so much time together, Yang Kai felt that Hua Qingsi’s character was trustworthy. So even if she hadn’t taken that heart demon oath, he wouldn’t have worried.

“Sir…” A weak voice called from the side. Yang Kai felt someone tug at his sleeve and turned to see Zhang Ruoxi looking at him expectantly.

He asked suspiciously, “What is it?”

“Sir, I… I…” Zhang Ruoxi stammered, unable to finish her sentence for a long time.

Yang Kai frowned. “Don’t tell me you want to act alone too?”

Seeing the eager look on Zhang Ruoxi’s face, he suddenly guessed her intention. To his surprise, Zhang Ruoxi actually nodded.

Yang Kai was shocked. “Are you sure?”

Zhang Ruoxi bit her red lips, took a deep breath, and seemed to muster her courage. “Ever since I left the Zhang Family, I’ve always cultivated under your protection. Although I’ve made some progress, my ancestor once said that a flower that never faces wind and rain will never grow strong. I don’t want to keep dragging you down, sir. I want to become stronger too… so… I want to try.”

Yang Kai said seriously, “Do you know how dangerous it is here?”

Zhang Ruoxi hesitated for a moment, then nodded gently.

Yang Kai continued, “Do you know what kind of people are in here? You’re naturally kind and simple, and you’ve never seen the treachery of the world. Are you sure you can survive here?”

“I’ll do my best!”

Yang Kai stared at her in a daze, as if seeing a new side of Zhang Ruoxi for the first time. This seemingly delicate girl could be strong-willed too.

“Master, I’ll go with her.” Liu Yan suddenly interjected. “If I’m with Ruoxi, we can look out for each other. Besides, I have Xiao Bai. There shouldn’t be any danger here.”

Yang Kai turned his head to look at Liu Yan and, seeing her nod at him, finally spoke, “If Liu Yan goes with you, is that acceptable?”

Zhang Ruoxi’s eyes lit up with joy. “It would be wonderful to have Sister Liu Yan by my side!”

Yang Kai, looking a little wistful, said, “Since your wings have grown strong, it’s time for you to fly.”

When he first brought Zhang Ruoxi with him, she was only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. But over the years, she had grown to the Dao Origin Realm.

If the Zhang Family knew about this, they’d be overjoyed. The Zhang Family hadn’t produced a Dao Origin Realm expert in many years. Even their most powerful ancestor was only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, which wasn’t much to speak of.

If Zhang Ruoxi acted alone, Yang Kai would truly be worried. She was probably just being competitive, wanting to be like Hua Qingsi. But she was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Even with her special bloodline, her cultivation was still low, and she had no experience in real combat. If she encountered danger, she might not be able to handle it.

But if Liu Yan went with her, there would be no problem.

Not to mention Liu Yan had Xiao Bai, a Heaven-Grade puppet, and her own strength was top-tier among Dao Origin Realm cultivators. She also had an Extinction Thunder Bead, while Zhang Ruoxi, though weaker, had the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress for protection.

As long as the two were careful, there shouldn’t be any danger.

Hearing Yang Kai say this, Zhang Ruoxi hurriedly waved her hands. “Sir, you misunderstand. That’s not what I meant.”

Liu Yan said, “Don’t mind it. Master was just speaking casually.”

Yang Kai handed a Spatial Ring to Liu Yan and said, “Take these with you, I gave Sister Hua the same. If the Shattered Star Sea closes one day and we’re separated, just wait for me at Thousand Leaves Sect.”

Liu Yan accepted the Spatial Ring and nodded. “I understand.”

“Go on.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

Zhang Ruoxi bit her red lips, then suddenly knelt before Yang Kai, bowing to the ground. “Sir, I will never forget your great kindness. Please stay safe. I will honor you well in the future.”

“Get up. It’s not like we’re parting forever. We’ll meet again.” Yang Kai bent down and helped her up.

“Let’s go,” Liu Yan said, taking Zhang Ruoxi’s small hand. With a surge of Origin Qi, she took her and flew into the starry sky.

In no time, the two girls had disappeared as well.

“So, everyone’s gone now.” Yang Kai muttered to himself, feeling a bit melancholic for no reason.

Over the years, he had always been alone, but because there was still some life in the Small Xuan Realm, he hadn’t felt too lonely. Now that Hua Qingsi, Liu Yan, and Zhang Ruoxi had all left, he felt a bit out of sorts, as if something was missing.

But he also knew that while it was safer for everyone to stay together, the gains would be smaller.

Now that the Star Refining Technique had been passed on to them, they would gain much more by acting separately. Maybe that was part of the reason they wanted to leave—not to drag him down or split his benefits.

Just as Yang Kai was feeling lost, he suddenly sensed his Incarnation calling him.

He quickly broke through the barrier of the Xuan Realm Pearl and connected with his Incarnation. “Don’t tell me you want to act alone too?”

Although the Incarnation’s intelligence was formed from a strand of his own Soul Incarnation, as its strength grew and the fusion between the strand and the Incarnation deepened, the Incarnation had become a special existence. It couldn’t be considered just a clone of Yang Kai anymore. It had its own thoughts and will. Of course, if they wished, their minds could still connect, and they could know each other’s thoughts without speaking.
