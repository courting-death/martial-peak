## Chapter 1139 — Space Blade

In the stone chamber, Yang Kai's expression was joyful.

He had never expected that his spur-of-the-moment experiment could actually work—the tiny spatial rift he tore open could truly be used as an offensive means.

Although it was only a finger's length and half an inch wide, and it vanished after advancing less than two feet, and its speed wasn't fast, with diligent practice and deeper perception of spatial power, he would certainly be able to employ this method against foes in the future.

Once the advancing speed of such rifts increases, who could stop them? Those rifts can devour everything; they are not something ordinary strength can withstand.

Heart racing, Yang Kai immediately began experimenting—one finger–long spatial rifts were ripped out and shot in all directions; the rifts' pushing speed gradually quickened and their advance distance kept increasing.

Yang Kai forgot about the passage of time; his entire mind sank into researching this new way of killing.

Until one spatial rift hit a corner of the wall and, without a sound or warning, a small piece of the rock there was gone—no trace, as if someone had cut a stone out and taken it away.

Yang Kai, however, knew that the stone hadn't vanished but had been swallowed by the spatial rift.

Staring at the mark on the rock wall, Yang Kai nodded inwardly; the rift's speed was still a serious weakness—too easy to dodge and not yet powerful enough. It should be due to the rift's instability; if it were stable enough, he believed that last rift could have punched through the entire wall, perhaps even pierced the cave straight through.

The spatial rift in its current state couldn't yet be used in battle; Saint King Realm warriors could stir their Saint Yuan to interfere with a rift's stability and force it to close, and once it closed it would be useless. But none of that dampened Yang Kai's enthusiasm for study.

Its shape was like a Wind Blade, Yang Kai thought, and he decided to name this new attack the Space Blade!

Yang Kai could almost foresee that once his Space Blade matured, killing above his rank would become easier and simpler—this kind of unorthodox power was hardest to guard against.

Yang Kai spent three consecutive days in the chamber studying the Space Blade; the power of the Space Blades he unleashed increased greatly. Just as he was brimming with excitement, his brow suddenly furrowed and his face turned cold.

He detected a number of experts approaching, and their auras were familiar—precisely the masters of the Haike Family.

A powerful Divine Sense swept outward; Yang Kai's expression grew grave. He discovered the newcomers weren't only Haike Family masters—among them were even two experts of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Recalling what Wu Yi had said earlier, he immediately realized those two Origin Returning Realm experts must be the reinforcements Ian had brought from Yingyue Hall.

That old man really intends to wipe us out! We have no grudge with the Haike Family; at most we took in Wu Yi and others who left the clan. We never killed any of them, yet they rushed to act while the Xu Family did not—it's them who grew eager.

At this moment Yang Kai could be certain Wu Yi's guess was correct.

His overly strong performance and occupation of Dragon Lair Mountain had already made the Haike Family uneasy; Dragon Lair Mountain was their territory. It's not far from the Haike Family; they were clearly afraid that as he grew stronger he would pose a threat.

For them to want to utterly eliminate him for this, Yang Kai's face hardened. He quietly resolved to show the Haike Family no more kindness—regardless of whether Wu Yi had once been of that clan, if they dared come this time they would not leave alive.

Rising to his feet, he opened the stone door; Wu Yi and Yu Feng were already standing outside, tense.

"Eldest Brother Yang..." Wu Yi called, her small face a little pale.

"I know. You all stay inside the cave and don't go out. Yang Flame has perfected a number of formations these days—so long as you don't go out, they can't take you."

"I'll face it with you," Wu Yi said—unexpectedly she showed no sign of retreat; she probably wanted to take this chance to settle things with the Haike Family.

Yang Kai glanced at her and gave a slight nod. "Then don't act rashly. Even if the situation gets critical, do not leave the cave entrance."

"Yes," Wu Yi replied quickly.

Only then did Yang Kai lead them outside. He found Yang Flame still arranging formations not far off, her movements astonishingly quick—clearly she didn't want to give up at the last moment.

When Yang Flame noticed Yang Kai had come out she secretly breathed a sigh, and then her already brisk movements became even faster.

Inside the cave, the warriors who had followed Wu Yi and received the news all poured out; one after another they stood behind Yang Kai and Wu Yi with solemn faces.

"Huh... why did that little shorty come? Walks like a crab—hopeless," Yang Kai said in surprise as he looked ahead. Among the crowd one figure stood out: the same stubby, short-bodied man he had met before, whose height barely reached his chest yet who swaggered like a dragon—Xie Hongwen, utterly arrogant.

When Wu Yi and the others gathered ore and had just reached Dark Star, that ship's ore had been snatched by this Xie Hongwen. Yang Kai also knew that Xie Hongwen had taken a liking to Wu Yi and had once spoken insolently, claiming that someday Wu Yi would be his Xie family's. It was likely his interest in Wu Yi that brought him here.

Xie Hongwen, though short, marched at the front, glaringly conspicuous; the Haike Family's Guest Elders followed him, and there were two First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts—probably from the City Lord's mansion.

Hearing Yang Kai's words, Wu Yi couldn't help but snort, but she quickly restrained herself—this was no time to laugh. With the City Lord's mansion's experts here and Xie Hongwen present, it seemed the family had made up its mind to eliminate Yang Kai; her expression immediately darkened.

Yang Kai caught Xie Hongwen's eye, and Xie Hongwen saw the situation here. Seeing Wu Yi apparently standing meekly beside Yang Kai, his eyes nearly spat fire as he ground his teeth and cursed, "Bitch, I thought you were so noble—turns out you're just putting on airs!"

Knowing how annoyed he was, Ian hurriedly said, "Young Master Xie, that youth called Yang Kai must not be underestimated. Though his realm is not high, his combat ability is beyond imagination; the Xu Family's..."

"I know, you've said it dozens of times already—my ears are about to grow calluses. Since this Young Master has shown up, he will surely die today. You just watch; no need for you to worry about other matters!" Xie Hongwen waved his hand impatiently, cutting Ian off.

The two Origin Returning Realm who had come with them also showed disdain, looking down on Ian, thinking small families are always shortsighted—once they encounter someone who can fight above their rank they act amazed.

"In Yingyue Hall there are plenty of disciples who can fight above their rank. Drag any Second Stage of the Saint Realm disciple here and they could defeat your Third Stage Guest Elders."

"Moreover, with two Origin Returning Realm in action this time, this place will soon be leveled."

Ian sighed inwardly and dared not say more for fear of annoying others; his heart was bitter.

He hadn't expected to have brought Xie Hongwen here. A few days ago he had taken many gifts to the City Lord's mansion and reported the matter to City Lord Fei Zhi Tu, who hadn't taken it seriously. If not for a chance encounter with Xie Hongwen, he would still be waiting at the mansion for news today.

Besides, Xie Hongwen hadn't brought experts for the Haike Family, nor to see justice for the Xu Family—he had come for Wu Yi.

Hearing Ian say that the woman he fancied had entangled herself with a man of only the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, Xie Hongwen flew into a rage and immediately came with two experts.

In any case, having invited reinforcements somewhat eased Ian's conscience. But after today, Wu Yi would likely suffer. Don't be fooled by Xie Hongwen's grotesque appearance and stumpy figure—his personality is twisted beyond measure. Any woman he fancies must be his; if someone else has a hand in her, the consequences are unimaginable.

Once he had desired the young lady of a minor family and told them he'd come with the betrothal gifts the next day. Unknown to him, that young lady slept with the man she loved that very night to escape him and lost her chastity.

Xie Hongwen paid him no heed—he killed the man, took the young lady to his place, and wantonly ravaged and humiliated her. A month later he stripped her naked and dumped her among the crowds of Tianyun City.

The young lady could not bear the shame and took her own life in the city; even when the corpse rotted no one dared claim it.

A month after that, the girl's family was inexplicably exterminated. Though there was no trace, anyone who understood would know it was Xie Hongwen's doing.

One could say Xie Hongwen's character had already twisted beyond saving.

Ian didn't know what fate awaited the Haike Family, he could only hope Wu Yi had kept her purity and hadn't lost her chastity like that young lady. If she remained untainted there might be some room to maneuver; if not, Ian couldn't imagine the storm the Haike Family would bring.

The Guest Elders in the clan all looked uneasy and trembled—clearly they recalled Xie Hongwen's numerous crimes and feared being implicated.

Xie Hongwen's face grew dark; they didn't even dare to breathe freely.

When they approached not far from the cave, Xie Hongwen's sullen expression suddenly disappeared. He stared at Yang Flame arranging formations and his fierce eyes shone with delight as he laughed, "Not bad, not bad—there's even a beauty here. Looks like we came for the right reason."

Although Yang Flame wore a loose black robe, her proud figure could not be hidden; her delicate pretty face fit Xie Hongwen's taste perfectly. His gaze lingered over her, his heart burning with desire—he wished he could take Yang Flame and Wu Yi away right now.
