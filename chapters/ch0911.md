## Chapter 911 — How Much Strength Do You Have Left?

As he spoke, the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation reached out and touched the void; not far off, an entrance to a void passage materialized—pitch black and deep, wide enough for several people to walk side by side.

"Use your own Demon Yuan to break free from the restraint of these Tongxuan Pillars, then leave from there." The Great Demon God waved and issued the order to leave.

Li Rong turned her gaze to Yang Kai, waiting for him to decide.

Yang Kai simply stared at the Great Demon God in silence, his eyes deep and vast like the starry void.

"Aren't you going to leave?" Seeing no movement, the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation barked, its stern voice reverberating in Yang Kai's mind like a hammer striking his heart; his qi and blood surged and his face flushed crimson.

Yang Kai soon calmed, shook his head, and said, "I'm taking them with me."

The Great Demon God snorted coldly. "Overestimating yourself. I already gave you a chance—if you won't seize it, then remain here forever! Even if you inherit my physical remains, intruding here carries a price!"

Yang Kai's expression unchanged, he glanced around and asked indifferently, "These eight pillars are called Tongxuan Pillars? We passed another one on the way in that was much longer and had the four characters Tongxuan Pillar carved on it—what's the connection?"

Trapped as he was, Yang Kai showed no anxiety; instead he had the leisure to chat with the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation, which surprised the latter. Li Rong looked at him with puzzled suspicion, unsure of his intent.

"There are many Tongxuan Pillars here—these eight are the true center...what are you asking for?" the Great Demon God replied coldly.

"Nothing much." Yang Kai shrugged and grinned. "I'm just thinking: since these are measures the Great Demon God left behind, they shouldn't have much to do with you—you are merely a guardian left by the original to watch over this place."

A gleam of approval flashed in the Great Demon God's eyes. He regarded Yang Kai with thin praise and slightly nodded. "You are quite perceptive."

"Just guessing, hehe." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "On the way here we passed a green sea filled with countless spirit bodies of powerful experts, and a strange sea of blood. I suppose these are the Great Demon God's seals to keep people away from the eight pillars, right?"

"So what if that's true?" the Great Demon God conceded with a nod. Yang Kai's calm, analytical demeanor suddenly amused him.

"It means nothing!" Yang Kai's smile turned uncanny. "It just strikes me as odd: if you're so formidable and any expert who comes here can be instantly bound, why did the Great Demon God set up so many seals to bar people from arriving? Isn't that redundant?"

"What are you implying?" The Great Demon God's eyes narrowed; unease flickered across his heart.

"I'm saying...you seem overwhelmingly powerful, but you're only a Soul Incarnation with little true strength. These eight pillars—the Great Demon God's measures—are what bind us here; they have nothing to do with you now!" Yang Kai's voice sank at the end.

Hearing that, Li Rong's face changed; she glanced suspiciously at the Soul Incarnation and reached out with her divine sense to investigate, only to find herself bound to the pillar and unable to mobilize her Divine Sense.

"Are you so sure?" The Soul Incarnation stared coldly at Yang Kai, as if its deepest secret had been exposed. Its expression shifted slightly, but its gaze remained resolute.

"You hurried us away because you don't want variables like us to remain here. I think when the Great Demon God set these seals he left a backdoor—those who can perform Demon God Transformation won't suffer flesh-and-blood pain. Coincidentally, Li Rong and I fit that condition, right?"

The Great Demon God suddenly burst into loud laughter. “Touch a nerve, did I? All that rambling of yours is nothing but your own delusions.”

Yang Kai shook his head. "After death, a soul's energy cannot persist long in the world—it fades. Even a Soul Incarnation can't escape that. Your Soul Incarnation lacks a vessel and likely clings to these eight pillars to avoid dissipation. After so many years, how much strength do you really have left?"

"How much strength I have, you can test for yourself," the Soul Incarnation sneered.

"I certainly will test it—because you can't drive the power of these eight pillars or release them!" Yang Kai roared. "Then I'll have to destroy the pillars myself!"

"You dare, brat!" The Soul Incarnation's color changed.

"Then watch closely and see if I dare!" Yang Kai laughed and unleashed his power; his qi and blood surged wildly.

The heavens and earth hummed and trembled; everyone's vision warped as if reality itself twisted, and the ferocity of that force made the two Great Lords of the yao race blanch.

They could not understand how a Transcendent Realm martial artist like Yang Kai could unleash such dominance.

Crack...

As if something had broken free, Yang Kai stepped down from the pillar that bound him, shaking his limbs; a series of crisp snaps echoed.

"Li Rong, come down and help!" Yang Kai called.

Li Rong froze, looking between Yang Kai and the Soul Incarnation, uncertain what to do.

The Great Demon God held an irreplaceable place in every demon's heart; that bone-deep reverence made Li Rong unable to go against him.

But Yang Kai was also the master of her Ancient Demon Clan; when he gave an order, she had to obey.

She was torn between duty and loyalty.

"He's not the Great Demon God—the original perished long ago. You needn't bear the burden in your heart."

"But..." Li Rong hesitated.

"Fine, stay there then." Yang Kai stopped forcing her and turned to the Soul Incarnation. "I'm going to start destroying these pillars now. If you can stop me, do it."

The Soul Incarnation only watched him gravely, showing no intention of intervening. After a long while it said in a low voice, "You truly intend to destroy this place?"

"Do I look like I'm joking?"

"Do you know what the consequences will be if this place is destroyed?"

"All I know is that if I don't destroy it, my friends and elders will die. You should know much about this place's secrets—can you tell me what this place controls? You just said it was the continent's nexus."

"Controls what?" The Soul Incarnation smiled faintly. "When you destroy it, you'll find out what it controls. I hope you can bear that cost."

Yang Kai frowned. "Vague threats."

Regardless of why the Great Demon God set so many seals here, or whether this place truly is the continent's core, since Meng Wuya was trapped on those pillars Yang Kai had to get him out.

As he spoke, Demon Yuan rolled on his right fist, radiating intense energy; from a distance the fist looked like a deep, dark hole that chilled the heart.

Boom...

His fist struck the pillar that once bound him; the pillar shuddered.

Cracks spread across it with a series of crisp fractures, and it looked as if it were about to crumble.

Yang Kai was surprised—the pillar broke so easily; he had prepared for a protracted battle.

When it saw him really strike, the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation no longer seemed anxious. It broke into hearty, unrestrained laughter, nodded, and said, "Your temper is as unyielding as mine—no wonder you were able to inherit this one’s remains."

"You're not going to stop me?" Yang Kai glanced back and shook his fist. "One more blow and this pillar will shatter."

The Soul Incarnation shrugged. "You said I have no power to stop you—how could I? Fine, this world has been sealed too long; it's time it saw the light again. If you have time, visit the Demon Capital and you'll learn the truths here."

"Explain clearly." Yang Kai's brow tightened.

The Soul Incarnation merely smiled enigmatically and then faded until it disappeared.

No matter how Yang Kai called, it gave no sign of returning.

"Quickly get us out—this place isn't fit to linger in..." Lei Long, the Great Lord, looked at Yang Kai listlessly and spoke weakly.

Yang Kai nodded, not wasting time, and punched the pillar again.

The pillar shattered with a roar; flying fragments scattered, and the massive energy sealed within burst out like a breached dam.

Calmly, Yang Kai produced his Silver Leaf secret treasure; like a falling Milky Way, its silver radiance wrapped everyone within.

The Vast Heaven Shield activated alongside it, blocking the brunt of the energy's harm.

Like a chain reaction, after the first pillar was destroyed the remaining seven all cracked; the restraints on everyone's power vanished in an instant.

Everyone fell together.

Crackle...

The seven pillars rang out and looked on the verge of exploding; the energies sealed inside stirred violently.

"Run!" Yang Kai shouted. If one pillar exploded he could barely hold back the unleashed force—if all seven went at once, none present would likely survive.

Li Rong immediately used her True Yuan to wrap the others and flew toward the void passage the Soul Incarnation had opened.

Yang Kai flickered to Xia Ningshang's side, scooped her up, and followed close behind Li Rong and the others.

They had barely entered the entrance when the world behind them began to hum; Yang Kai stole a glance back and his face turned pale.

That world seemed to decompose, falling apart; the shattered space rapidly spread toward the void passage.

At the spot where the eight pillars once stood, the Soul Incarnation reappeared, quietly watching the direction Yang Kai and the others had fled before being swallowed by a beam of light.
