## Chapter 1626 — Winds Rise and Clouds Surge

Bing Long nodded, reached out and drew the portrait toward her; at a glance the person in the portrait looked to be about twenty-five or twenty-six years old, his expression cold and resolute. His looks were neither strikingly handsome nor ugly, nothing particularly unusual—yet the Fire Radiance Sect had gone to great lengths to seek him out.

“Take a look, all of you.” Bing Long casually tossed the portrait to another elder. “Remember this man’s face. If we can find him, bring him back to Icebound Island! Not long ago, Fire Radiance Sect was preparing to move against Ice Heart Valley, but for some reason they suddenly backed off because of this person. It seems he’s involved in something significant—otherwise, Fire Radiance Sect would never have acted that way. Perhaps the key to resolving our current crisis lies with him.”

"Shall we search for him as well?" Ran Yunting asked.

Bing Long nodded. "Of course, but don't be excessive. After you return, give each disciple a copy of this portrait and tell them to be more observant when they travel about."

"Yes, Valley Master, wise decision!" the elders replied in unison.

The portrait passed from hand to hand among the elders; they were all experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and their memories were sharp—one look was enough for them to memorize the man's appearance.

Bing Long continued, "A few years ago our Grand Elder made a cultivation error and has yet to recover. Have the people searching for the medicinal herbs turned up any clues?"

At those words, the dozen or so people present all shook their heads gloomily. One elder spoke up, “We’ve already spent a fortune to acquire all the other ingredients, but that one stalk of Scarlet Profound Ginseng is truly rare. Perhaps… only Fire Radiance Sect’s Qianlei Mountain has it.”

"Qianlei Mountain!" Bing Long's expression darkened. "That is the Fire Radiance Sect's forbidden area; only a handful within the Fire Radiance Sect may enter, let alone us. Still, order a careful search—no matter the cost, it must be found."

"Yes!"

"Damn it!" Ran Yunting ground her teeth. "If the Grand Elder had not made that cultivation error years ago, how would Ice Heart Valley be suppressed by the Fire Radiance Sect! For ten thousand years the two sects have been evenly matched, yet this time..."

Hearing her, the elders' faces were full of resentment.

"Great Elder, enough with the nonsense—are you blaming the Grand Elder for that cultivation error?" Bing Long's almond-shaped eyes flashed; she spoke with authority.

Ran Yunting trembled and hurriedly replied, "I would not dare—this disciple did not mean that."

Bing Long’s expression softened slightly, and she nodded. “I know that’s not what you meant. Still, this is a tribulation Ice Heart Valley must face. Though the Grand Elder is not in a condition to act right now, Fire Radiance Sect will not find it so easy to make us submit. Enough of that for now—there’s another matter that concerns me. Great Elder, how is your disciple faring?”

Ran Yunting smiled slightly. "She is well; she has already reached the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm."

At these words, everyone present was visibly moved.

"Already the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm so soon?"

"Her talent is that good? When Great Elder brought her back she was only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, wasn't she? How many years has it been?"

"Even with abundant cultivation resources, such rapid advancement is rare, isn't it?"

Bing Long appeared extremely pleased. "Great Elder, I heard your disciple possesses the Ice-Crystal Yu Body—is that true?"

"Indeed," Ran Yunting nodded. "Her physique is the Ice-Crystal Yu Body, but it appears not to be innate—rather formed later; we do not know what extraordinary events she experienced before. After cultivating Ice Heart Valley's secret techniques, her progress has been meteoric. To be frank, Valley Master, not only is she at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, she is preparing to break into the Second Stage!"

Inside the Ice Palace, the elders' expressions became even more animated, each one extremely astonished.

Bing Long was also overjoyed. "Innate or acquired makes no difference. Her Ice-Crystal Yu Body could be the key to Ice Heart Valley's future. Heaven has not forsaken Ice Heart Valley! It seems she may one day reach the Grand Elder's level; the future of Ice Heart Valley might be entrusted to her."

Ran Yunting responded modestly, "Valley Master flatters her; the young girl's cultivation is still low and she needs much nurturing from you."

“See that all her cultivation needs are met—no matter the cost!” Bing Long commanded sharply.

"Yes!" Ran Yunting bowed respectfully.

"Great Elder, I heard the Fire Radiance Sect has been targeting Ice Heart Valley this time because of your disciple?" someone asked with a light laugh.

"That is correct; I have heard the same. It is said the Fire Radiance Sect's Sect Master's son Wei Feng met that girl during his travels and could not forget her; he then urged Wei Qing to come to Ice Heart Valley to demand her!"

"I have not seen that girl. Since she came to Icebound Island she has seldom gone out and has been in seclusion to cultivate."

"I saw her once—her beauty is truly peerless. No wonder that little bastard Wei Feng cannot forget her. If I were a man, I might be bewitched by her myself."

The elders laughed heartily and the atmosphere lightened.

"All hearsay," Ran Yunting said with a bitter smile.

Bing Long said, "You are elders of Ice Heart Valley—can't you see this is merely a pretext? The Fire Radiance Sect is using it to trouble us and to probe the Grand Elder's wound. Once they confirm the Grand Elder is injured, they may make a major move; this cannot be hidden long."

"I want to see whether the Fire Radiance Sect's bite is harder, or whether Ice Heart Valley's defenses are stronger!"

"They would not dare launch a large-scale invasion unless they don't care about their disciples' lives."

"If they dare come, we'll make them pay!"

The group of women clamored, their morale high.

On the left, an elderly matron of about sixty furrowed her brow, worry etched on her face. After everyone had finished speaking, she opened her mouth: "Reporting to the Sect Master, this elder heard a piece of news a few days ago."

"What news has Elder Wu so concerned?" Bing Long turned her gaze to the matron; others also looked toward her.

"I heard Luo Hai has gone to the Fire Radiance Sect!" Elder Wu said in a low voice.

"Luo Hai?" Inside the Ice Palace everyone furrowed their brows, some not immediately recalling who Luo Hai was, but soon someone exclaimed, "Cuiwei Star's Star Lord Luo Hai?"

"Is it really him?"

“No way! What’s he doing on Chi Lan Star instead of guarding Cuiwei Star?”

Although Luo Hai is Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, he is an expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. His fame stretches throughout the Star Domain, so even those within Ice Heart Valley on Icebound Island had long heard his renown.

Upon hearing that he had gone to the Fire Radiance Sect, everyone turned pale.

"Is the information reliable?" Bing Long leaned forward, jade hand gripping the armrest so that the chair creaked; her emotions were greatly stirred.

"Reliable!" Elder Wu's expression was grave. "My spy planted within the Fire Radiance Sect saw it with his own eyes."

The Ice Palace fell silent; everyone's faces seemed covered in a layer of frost, their expressions changed.

"You all likely know that although Lord Luo Hai is Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, he is on close terms with Chi Huo of the Fire Radiance Sect. That he has arrived at the Fire Radiance Sect at this time..." Elder Wu did not finish, but everyone caught her implied meaning.

"It cannot be!" Bing Long shook her head. "He and Chi Huo are indeed acquainted, but not to the extent of rushing from Cuiwei Star just to deal with Ice Heart Valley; Chi Huo does not have that kind of standing."

"But Valley Master, this is a sensitive time; we must be on guard. If Luo Hai and Chi Huo join forces, Ice Heart Valley would be in dire straits."

Bing Long's fair face drained of color.

If that were truly the case, Ice Heart Valley might only have one option left—disband. A single Luo Hai would be more than Ice Heart Valley could resist; he was a full tier stronger than Chi Huo and even their Grand Elder.

"I suspect Lord Luo Hai's arrival at Chi Lan Star might be related to the person the Fire Radiance Sect is searching for," one elder speculated.

"How do you mean?"

"Think it through. The Fire Radiance Sect's search for that person began only recently, even slowing their pressure on us. Lord Luo Hai's arrival at Chi Lan Star was also recent; since he went to the Fire Radiance Sect, could it be that Lord Luo Hai asked the Fire Radiance Sect to help locate that person's whereabouts?"

Everyone's eyes brightened.

"Highly likely! If so, we must find that person's trace before the Fire Radiance Sect does!" Bing Long's beautiful eyes flashed with a peculiar light. "If we find him and turn him over to Lord Luo Hai, Ice Heart Valley's present crisis will be resolved. Once the Grand Elder fully recovers, the Fire Radiance Sect will no longer stir up trouble!"

"Valley Master is right." Ran Yunting nodded in agreement.

"Issue the orders: mobilize every available disciple and search to the fullest extent for any trace of this person!" Bing Long made the decision and barked through clenched teeth.

"Yes!" The elders responded and departed the Ice Palace.

That day, over ten thousand Ice Heart Valley disciples set out from Icebound Island for various places across Chi Lan Star, each carrying a portrait—the image depicted Yang Kai's face.

At night, near the center of Icebound Island, in an ice chamber Ran Yunting sat cross-legged and cultivated.

The ice chamber's temperature was bitterly low; even warriors at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would find it uncomfortable and had to circulate Saint Yuan to resist the omnipresent cold. But for Ice Heart Valley's Great Elder, this was the best place to cultivate.

The pervasive cold seemed drawn to her, pouring into her body and resonating with her Saint Yuan, strengthening her power.

Light footsteps sounded outside; soon they ceased. Someone outside said, "This disciple has come to pay respects to Master!"

"Come in!" Ran Yunting smiled faintly and opened her eyes.

A moment later the door opened and a beautiful figure stepped inside.

She wore immaculate white, a single lock of black hair cascading like a waterfall; her phoenix brows were delicately arched, her eyes exceptionally bright, her nose elegant, her oval face pale and jewel-like, her skin tender and lustrous as soft honey. Her figure was tall and graceful, composed and serene.

She was dressed in spotless white, black hair cascading like a waterfall. Her phoenix brows were finely arched, eyes bright and clear, her nose elegant, and her oval face pale and jewel-like. Fair skin shone with a soft, honeyed glow, and her slender figure exuded a quiet, unhurried grace.

She looked like an ice doll carved by the heavens, flawless from head to toe.
