## Chapter 1559 — The Sovereign

As time flowed on, as races evolved and advanced, this star gradually bloomed with color and vigor, its energies abundant; great races prospered and the entire continent flourished.

All living things were wantonly drawing energy from the land, indiscriminately taking whatever benefited them.

At some unknown point, it suddenly began to grow old.

It no longer possessed so much energy to supply those beings learning to cultivate and breathe; it no longer had surplus energy to produce vast amounts of precious and rare cultivation materials.

It began to grow barren; it had the will but not the strength, watching countless lives live on its soil, helpless to aid them.

The ancient prosperity gradually faded, the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth thinning day by day, and cultivators’ realms and attainments declined with the passing of time.

No one could any longer probe into higher Heavenly and Martial Dao.

It had truly grown old, like a kindly father or a loving mother who had reared a child with toil, raising them to adulthood, letting them take and take without complaint.

But it could no longer provide more help to its children.

It had once known youth and boundless vigor, but now it could only cling to life and wait for the day of its end.

Its children called it the Tongxuan Continent!

…

Yang Kai came to from that mysterious state, his gaze weathered and full of years.

He had personally witnessed the birth, rise, decline, and the gradual demise of a cultivation star; he, like that star, had spent those countless eons, and an indescribable emotion suddenly welled up within him.

His state of mind soared in cultivation with frantic speed. In that instant he understood so very many things, like a sage who had lived for untold ages, wisdom bright and full in his eyes.

He felt that if he now broke through to the Void King Realm, his state of mind would remain without fault!

His comprehension of the Martial and Heavenly Dao had already far surpassed his own cultivation!

The advancement of mind and heart comes from accumulation over time, from witnessing the evolution and development of things around oneself — coinciding with what Yang Kai had just experienced.

The refinement of one’s state of mind could not be measured or explained clearly, yet it existed truly, and only Yang Kai himself could feel it; he had not expected that Little Senior Sister’s refining of the Stellar Origin would also benefit him.

He longed to sink back into that wondrous atmosphere, but no matter how he strove, he could no longer enter the spiritual world of the entire continent.

This brought him some rueful sighs.

Suddenly sensing something, Yang Kai’s face darkened. He scrambled up from the ground and rushed toward the subterranean abyss.

Faint groans reached him from below — Little Senior Sister’s voice, full of hardship and pain!

At the edge he saw that vast grey fire swaying and unsteady; Little Senior Sister was nowhere to be seen, yet he could feel Xia Ningshang enveloped within that grey flame, buoying and sinking.

Spiritual Qi was crazily converging toward the underground abyss, not just from the hundreds of li around, but spreading even farther.

It seemed as though the Spiritual Qi of the entire star had become somewhat chaotic.

Little Senior Sister’s cultivation realm was rising at a terrifying, frenzied speed.

She had originally only been at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, but now she had already reached the peak of that very stage.

In a moment more, she would directly break through to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm!

The ascent did not stop and continued to climb step by step.

At the peak of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, she was clearly already touching the threshold of the Origin Returning Realm.

Yang Kai’s eyes showed astonishment.

Such unchecked advancement places enormous strain on a cultivator’s body, but with Little Senior Sister’s aptitude she should be able to endure.

What worried Yang Kai was not that, but the Spiritual Qi around them… it seemed it was no longer pouring in here.

The Spiritual Qi that had gathered earlier had been consumed when Xia Ningshang broke through the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm and struck against the Origin Returning Realm.

The enormous grey fire bore Xia Ningshang’s aura, indicating her fusion with the Stellar Origin was proceeding smoothly, yet it was precisely that smoothness which had placed her in a dilemma.

There was no more Spiritual Qi to allow her to break into the Origin Returning Realm, nor enough Qi for her to undergo the Heaven-and-Earth Energy baptism.

This was a major realm breakthrough that could not tolerate the slightest carelessness; if it failed, given Xia Ningshang’s current state of fusing with the Stellar Origin, the outcome would be far from good.

Yang Kai grew secretly anxious.

Suddenly, a bright idea flashed before his eyes.

If the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth was insufficient, Saint Crystals could substitute! He had not used Saint Crystals when he broke through before because the Dark Star’s energy had been plentiful and had fully met his needs.

Since the Tongxuan Continent’s energy could not sustain Little Senior Sister, Saint Crystals could exactly make up the difference.

Yang Kai brushed his hand over his ring; vast sheets of Saint Crystals, flashing pure white light like a pouring galaxy, fell downward.

Before they reached the bottom of the abyss they were already pulverized, erupting from within into clusters of undeniable energy that surged toward Xia Ningshang and the place of the great grey flame.

Xia Ningshang’s strained groans vanished, and the chaotic aura from below began to stabilize; even the wavering grey fire steadied considerably.

A pleased look crossed Yang Kai’s face as he poured more Saint Crystals downwards.

For this voyage he had brought many Saint Crystals, including those looted from the Leitai Sect’s main headquarters and a portion of Lingxiao Sect’s reserves.

At this moment, hundreds of millions of Saint Crystals were all cast down by Yang Kai.

The Spiritual Qi gradually grew dense; the great grey fire swelled, Little Senior Sister’s aura steadied, and everything moved toward a better outcome.

Yang Kai felt Xia Ningshang’s aura rapidly climbing; she would soon break through the shackles of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

The Heaven-and-Earth Energy baptism followed!

The Heaven-and-Earth Energy transformed from the Saint Crystals converged in surging, violent waves, fierce and mighty like ancient dragons, crashing upon Little Senior Sister.

In the grey flames a pair of small hands danced through, forming intricate seals to guide that Heaven-and-Earth Energy into herself, accepting the bodily baptism and spiritual elevation of this great realm ascent.

The whole process was magnificent and perilous, yet ended without calamity.

When those torrential Heaven-and-Earth energies had calmed, the vast grey fire beneath the abyss suddenly vanished.

Heaven and earth returned to darkness.

But from Little Senior Sister’s delicate form emanated a faint luminescence; like a descended goddess she was solemn, dignified, and untouchable.

Yang Kai stood above the abyss, quietly watching her, dazzled and enthralled.

Little Senior Sister was now truly an expert of the Origin Returning Realm; although only of the First Stage, with the Stellar Origin of the Tongxuan Continent and the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body within her, she possessed limitless potential.

Such terrifying potential would likely even cause Yang Kai to look up in awe.

He did not feel inferior. He only understood that the effort required in the future would likely be greater.

Otherwise, if his woman towered above him, it would wound his pride.

Little Senior Sister made no move; she merely stood in the void, eyes closed, a mysterious expression on her face as if silently comprehending something.

After a great while, Xia Ningshang suddenly opened her beautiful eyes, filled with the expression of a rich harvest, and joyfully flew upward.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, reached out, and pulled her close.

"Junior Brother, I seem to have surpassed the Saint King Realm," Xia Ningshang said excitedly.

"Mm, you truly have," Yang Kai nodded lightly.

"What is this realm called? It feels so wondrous."

"Origin Returning Realm. I am now in this realm too. At this Stage one must refine one’s Shi; I’ll explain when there’s time."

"All right."

"Let’s go out first. I don’t know how much time has passed; those in the Sacred Land must be anxious." Yang Kai suggested, then led Xia Ningshang outward.

"Let me do it." Xia Ningshang stopped him, a look of eager anticipation on her face.

Yang Kai glanced at her and quickly understood, nodding lightly.

Xia Ningshang then extended a finger and lightly tapped forward.

The pure and innocent beauty in that gesture seemed to carry no hint of the mortal world.

A vortex suddenly appeared ahead.

Xia Ningshang grabbed Yang Kai and the two dove in.

When they reappeared, Yang Kai found himself standing within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, in front of the chamber where Xia Ningshang had previously closed herself off.

In a single step they had spanned a barrier of one million li!

Even Yang Kai, who had trained in spatial power, could not accomplish such a feat.

"Junior Brother, you were right. After fusing with the Stellar Origin, I feel as if I have become the sovereign of this continent; with a thought I can go to any place on the land and even mobilize the continent’s energy," Xia Ningshang explained softly.

"This is the power of the Star Lord," Yang Kai said with a light laugh. "That is why Void King Realm experts seek to refine the Stellar Origin — they can obtain unimaginable benefits and insights. Little Senior Sister, from now on the Tongxuan Continent is inseparable from you. You are the first to refine the Stellar Origin at the Saint King Realm; the rise and fall of this land will be tied to your cultivation. Whether our homeland can be revitalized depends on your efforts."

Yang Kai’s words suddenly placed a mountain of pressure on Xia Ningshang’s shoulders.

It seemed the future of countless lives across the entire continent rested upon her.

But Xia Ningshang quickly recovered and nodded: "I will do my best and not let it decay further."

"Come. Many are waiting for us." Yang Kai smiled slightly and pulled Xia Ningshang in one direction.

Through his perception he sensed innumerable familiar life auras waiting for them.

A great hall within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was nearly full to overflowing.

Here, humans, yao, and demons had gathered together.

The continent’s notable figures were almost all present.

This was an immensely terrifying concentration of power.

Although the numbers were many, the hall was extremely quiet, with only the occasional glance cast toward the hall’s entrance, as if awaiting the arrival of someone.

Only one person across the entire continent could draw experts from humans, yao, and demons alike to gather and wait for so many days.

The Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land!
