## Chapter 1786 — Words Like Farts

"In that case, wait and call me grandpa!" Yang Kai laughed loudly. As he spoke, his figure flickered and he had already moved to stand behind the nearest spatial rift from the Heavenly Infant Grass.

That rift was less than twenty zhang away from where the Heavenly Infant Grass grew.

After Yang Kai had steadied himself, Xu Wei and Zi Long fixed their gazes on him; father and son watched him with the look of spectators enjoying a show, all eyes trained on Yang Kai's movements.

No one believed Yang Kai could succeed.

Standing there in thought for a moment, Yang Kai then reached out and flicked forth a Golden Blood Thread.

He had never tested how terrifying the Seven Luminaries Divine Light truly was; Ni Guang had only warned him that it was dangerous, so he had no idea whether his Golden Blood Threads would be of any use.

Golden light flashed, and with Yang Kai's cautious control the Golden Blood Threads inched into the Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

But in the next instant Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly.

The moment the tip of the Golden Blood Threads brushed the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, a hissing sound issued forth; under the influence of the Divine Light, the tip of the Golden Blood Threads was simply corroded away.

That was not all — the corrosive force traveled along the Golden Blood Threads toward Yang Kai at great speed.

Yang Kai was startled; he hastily let go and threw the Golden Blood Threads away, but before they even hit the ground the entire strand had been corroded clean and utterly vanished.

Yang Kai could not help wearing a look of horror.

The terrifying might of the Seven Luminaries Divine Light was truly not exaggerated.

The Golden Blood Threads were condensed from his own Golden Blood; from the moment he had formed them until now none had ever been damaged. Yet here, under the corrosion of the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, they disintegrated in an instant.

The Seven Luminaries Divine Light ignored all defenses; not only could it corrode flesh and blood, it possessed the power to annihilate a soul. The characteristics of the Golden Blood Threads were precisely countered by it.

Judging by this, any living being of flesh and blood that was touched by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light would suffer extremely grave consequences.

On the other side, Xu Wei and Zi Long, who had been watching Yang Kai, were secretly alarmed.

It was their first time witnessing the might of the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; the two at the Void King Realm felt certain that if they accidentally touched that Divine Light they would be ruined.

Very soon Xu Wei loudly sneered, "Kid, you don't seem to have much skill — is that it? Come on, do more."

Yang Kai glanced at him and sneered.

The reason he had earlier sent out the Golden Blood Threads had been mainly to test whether the Seven Luminaries Divine Light was as fearsome as the rumors said; now that he had the answer, of course he would not keep testing.

He already had a plan for how to obtain that Heavenly Infant Grass. No matter what, the Heavenly Infant Grass was valuable; Yang Kai did not want to let it go, and he certainly did not want Xu Wei and Zi Long to get it.

Ignoring Xu Wei's taunts, he simply sat down cross‑legged.

Immediately he reached out and summoned. A golden, gawky stone man suddenly appeared before Yang Kai.

The Second Stone Puppet!

The Second Stone Puppet was Yang Kai's Incarnation; when it had been born within the Lingxiao Sect it had lacked natural intelligence. Though it had lived, it had no true consciousness and could not act on its own — it was a dimwit of the Stone Puppet race, so Yang Kai used it as his Incarnation.

Because when it was formed Yang Kai had poured much Golden Blood into it, it looked resplendently golden and was somewhat different from the other Stone Puppet, Xiaoxiao.

All along this Incarnation had been of little use. In battles Yang Kai already had the Fire Bird Liu Yan and Xiaoxiao as major supports, so he had kept the Incarnation in reserve.

But now was the perfect time to use it.

He did not dare casually send out Xiaoxiao, since Xiaoxiao was one of his major aids. If something unexpected happened within the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, the loss would be great.

The Stone Puppet race was not flesh and blood, so it should not fear the Seven Luminaries Divine Light; and because it lacked natural intelligence it would not fear the Divine Light's soul‑annihilating power either. The only thing to worry about was Yang Kai's own Soul Incarnation.

For the Incarnation Stone Puppet to move, Yang Kai had to pour the Soul Incarnation he had been nurturing in his Sea of Consciousness into the Incarnation so he could control it.

Whether the Seven Luminaries Divine Light could harm his Soul Incarnation through the Incarnation's body was unknown.

But such things must be tried to be known. Yang Kai had made up his mind and reached to touch the Incarnation's head.

The strand of Soul Incarnation he had been nurturing in his Sea of Consciousness was immediately poured into the Incarnation, and the once dull eyes of the Incarnation instantly became lively.

Yang Kai himself felt as if he were split in two; he not only retained his own vision and perception but gained the Incarnation's as well. In that moment the Incarnation and his true body produced a blood‑linked sensation that was extremely wondrous.

Controlling the Incarnation, he moved its heavy limbs slightly to adapt to its weight.

"What is that?" Zi Donglai looked stunned, staring blankly at the golden Stone Puppet, utterly perplexed.

He had never seen such a strange being; that stone man did not look like a lifeless puppet but seemed to possess life of its own, bizarre in the extreme.

Though the aura coming from the stone man was not strong, it was unlike anything he had seen before, so he wanted to ask his father.

He had assumed his father would know something from his experience and insight, but Zi Long was silent for a long moment before softly saying, "Father does not know what it is either."

Zi Donglai was immediately shocked.

There were things in the Star Domain even his father did not recognize? He involuntarily glanced toward Xu Wei, but soon realized that the elder from the Abandoned Nest also seemed ignorant of that strange lifeform; Xu Wei frowned and watched with a baffled look.

He didn't know either!

Where had this Yang Kai found that thing that even two Void King Realm men could not identify? Zi Donglai was stunned.

But in the next moment Zi Donglai's heart leapt and he instinctively whispered, "He isn't going to use that thing to..."

Though he could not recognize the Stone Puppet, he could see it was not flesh and blood; such a thing entering the Seven Luminaries Divine Light should be fine, which meant Yang Kai really could take the remaining Heavenly Infant Grass.

Realizing this, Zi Donglai's face darkened, and recalling his earlier words about severing his meridians his mood soured.

Xu Wei felt equally unpleasant.

Zi Donglai had only said he would sever his meridians; Xu Wei had said he would call Yang Kai grandpa. If Yang Kai actually got the Heavenly Infant Grass...

Damn it, why wouldn't the Seven Luminaries Divine Light withdraw! Xu Wei cursed inwardly, wanting nothing more than to use a secret technique to disperse the Divine Light and then attack Yang Kai.

Under the three's watchful eyes, Yang Kai had already guided the Incarnation forward a step and entered the Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

Once the Incarnation stepped into the range of that Divine Light, Yang Kai felt as if his whole body sank, as though a ten thousand‑jin stone pressed on him — the Seven Luminaries Divine Light had a Domain‑like might akin to the Void King Realm; where its light covered the space became viscous and it was extremely difficult to advance.

Fortunately, after a brief observation Yang Kai found that the Soul Incarnation lodged in the Incarnation had suffered no damage; the Seven Luminaries Divine Light was blocked outside the Incarnation and could not invade its body.

This discovery pleased Yang Kai greatly; it seemed his speculation was correct — the Divine Light's property of ignoring defenses targeted flesh and blood. Non‑flesh‑and‑blood beings were not suppressed.

That meant if he encountered other heavenly treasures he could not personally collect, he could send the Incarnation to do it.

With that thought he continued to guide the Incarnation forward.

The strand of Soul Incarnation in it inherited his will and comprehension of cultivation, so although the Incarnation itself was not powerful it could still draw upon spatial force.

A ripple of spatial secret technique surrounded the Incarnation, greatly reducing its burden and causing its speed to increase noticeably.

The twenty zhang distance was rapidly eaten up as the Incarnation advanced step by step.

Xu Wei's face had turned as black as a pot's bottom.

He had realized that the remaining Heavenly Infant Grass would not escape Yang Kai's clutches; that was not the core problem — the real issue was the words he had just spoken.

He could never actually call Yang Kai grandpa; if the words left his mouth he would be finished, forced to hide away in the Abandoned Nest for life and never show his face again.

But if he failed to honor his words he would be mocked by Yang Kai; that kid's venomous tongue was something Xu Wei had already suffered.

He felt a secret headache and his expression became ugly.

In barely a dozen breaths the Incarnation reached the Heavenly Infant Grass. Though the Stone Puppet's palm was broad and thick, under Yang Kai's control it deftly collected the Heavenly Infant Grass, then turned and stepped back toward where Yang Kai himself stood.

When the Incarnation returned, Yang Kai took the Heavenly Infant Grass, placed it into a prepared box and sealed it, then smilingly withdrew his Soul Incarnation and reabsorbed the Incarnation.

He then turned and looked toward Xu Wei.

Xu Wei's gaze darted about evasively...

"What, won't admit you lost?" Yang Kai sneered. "Wasn't there someone just now who said they'd call me grandpa?"

Xu Wei instantly flushed with anger and shame; his face stiffened and he glared at Yang Kai as if ready to start a fight the moment Yang Kai spoke another word.

He was resolved to cheat; after all Yang Kai could do nothing to him.

Yang Kai snorted and glanced at Zi Donglai. "Didn't someone else say they'd sever their meridians?"

Zi Donglai shouted, "Who do you think you are, daring to make this Young Master sever his meridians?"

Yang Kai clapped his hands and laughed, "So your words are nothing but farts."

Zi Long snorted coldly, "Kid, heed my advice: leave a way out for yourself so we may meet again; there's no need to make things irreversible."

"Leave a way out?" Yang Kai's sneer deepened. "For trash like you? There's no need."

"Watch your tongue, boy. Don't forget that the Seven Luminaries Divine Light will withdraw soon — do you know what will become of you then?" Zi Long narrowed his eyes and fixed Yang Kai with a chilling light in his gaze.
