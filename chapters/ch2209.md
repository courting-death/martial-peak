## Chapter 2209 — Granny You

"Greetings, Granny!" Gao Xueting's expression became solemn as she cupped her fists toward the figure.

Yang Kai and the others quickly looked over and saw that Granny You was extremely short, only reaching Yang Kai's chest. She was hunched over, leaning on a cane, her whole person appearing frail and trembling.

The word "ugly" hardly described Granny You's face. It was pitted and scarred, lined with wrinkles and age spots; she looked as if she wouldn't live much longer.

Only her jade-green eyes were bright and piercing; meeting them made everyone's heart shudder.

Such a visage, coupled with that gaze, could only bring one word to mind—sinister.

Murong Xiaoxiao, a bit timid, already looked slightly pale. Even the men like Yang Kai looked extremely uncomfortable.

But with her standing before them, they didn't dare be disrespectful; they cupped their fists and called out, "Greetings, Senior."

Granny You nodded slightly, showing little reaction as she scanned them. At the same time, an almost suffocating Divine Sense swept across everyone's bodies.

Yang Kai was greatly shocked, staring at the old woman in front of him in astonishment.

He discovered that her Divine Sense was unbelievably powerful, not inferior to that of Aunt Feng, whom he had met before.

Aunt Feng, after all, was an expert at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, someone on par with Wen Zishan.

But the energy fluctuations from Granny You didn't seem to indicate the Third Stage; based on Yang Kai's experience, she should only be at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm.

In other words, although this old woman only had the cultivation of the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, her Divine Sense was comparable to the Third Stage. Who knew if it was due to her innate talent or because she had guarded the Divine Roaming Mirror for so many years.

Yang Kai secretly felt the latter was much more likely. According to Wen Zishan, the greatest wonder of the Divine Roaming Mirror was to enhance a martial artist's Divine Sense.

She had guarded the Divine Roaming Mirror here for years, so she must have gained tremendous benefits from this rare treasure.

"Oh?" After sweeping her Divine Sense over everyone, Granny You suddenly fixed her gaze on Yang Kai, as if she had discovered something, and let out a strange cackle: "This little fellow is interesting..."

Gao Xueting glanced at Yang Kai, her brows slightly furrowed, but she said nothing more.

After that, Granny You said nothing more about Yang Kai, only declaring in her harsh voice, "The rest of you are just so-so!"

Gao Xueting cupped her fists and said, "Then I'll trouble Granny to send them into the Divine Roaming Mirror."

"Hmph, that little bastard Wen Zishan only knows how to order this old woman around!" Granny You suddenly cursed after hearing this.

Yang Kai and the others were stunned, staring at the old woman before them in disbelief.

Wen Zishan was, after all, the Hall Master of Qingyang Shrine. Since Granny You had been ordered to guard this forbidden place, she was obviously a member of the Shrine. As a martial artist of the Shrine, she actually dared to curse the Hall Master as a little bastard in front of so many people…

No matter how you thought about it, something felt off.

After cursing, Granny You turned her head and glared at them with sharp, hawk-like eyes, saying fiercely, "What? He trapped this old woman here. Can't I curse him? Do you have any objections?"

Everyone quickly shook their heads like rattles, feeling that there was a lot of information in that sentence…

On the other side, Gao Xueting frowned and said, "Granny, you are here only because of your bet with the Hall Master. Why must you..."

"What do you know?" Granny You's temper was indeed terrible. After cursing Wen Zishan, she turned her anger on Gao Xueting, agitatedly saying, "Back then, you were just a little girl. What do you know? That bastard Wen Zishan—if this old woman could beat him, I would have torn him to pieces long ago..."

She seemed to recall something very unpleasant, so she started cursing non-stop, banging her cane on the ground as she did so, making the whole cave echo with loud noises.

Yang Kai and the others stood where they were, watching in fear, worried that this old woman might suddenly go mad and attack them.

With her Divine Sense comparable to the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, if she really went berserk, even Gao Xueting might not be able to protect them.

Fortunately, although Granny You was extremely angry, she hadn't lost her mind. After cursing for a while, she suddenly fell silent, standing there panting heavily, as if exhausted.

Gao Xueting's face was also very unsightly. She endured her impatience and didn't dare to interrupt, only waiting for Granny You to finish before saying, "Granny, let's send them in first."

"I know!" the old woman replied impatiently, turning to look at Gao Xueting. "Are you going in this time?"

Gao Xueting replied, "Yes."

"Good, then each of you find a stone chamber for yourselves!" After speaking, Granny You suddenly pointed her cane forward.

Following her direction, Yang Kai and the others finally noticed that around the mysterious Divine Roaming Mirror, there were several man-made stone chambers, each with a restriction token hanging on the door.

A rough count showed there were about ten stone chambers, arranged in a semicircle around the Divine Roaming Mirror.

Gao Xueting explained, "You all should know how to enter the Divine Roaming Mirror. Only the Spirit Body can enter, so after we enter the forbidden area, our physical bodies cannot move. These stone chambers were personally built by the Hall Master. While your Divine Sense is roaming the Divine Roaming Mirror, as long as you activate the restriction, you will be safe. Without the restriction token or the Hall Master himself, no one can break into the stone chambers or harm your bodies."

Everyone nodded in understanding.

"Isn't it all to guard against this old woman!" Granny You snorted coldly again, then sneered, "If you were so worried about me, why didn't you just kill me back then? Why give me such an important task and have me guard this forbidden place..."

She muttered to herself, and no one paid her any mind.

But Yang Kai and the others all knew she was telling the truth.

Wen Zishan had specially built these stone chambers to protect the disciples whose Spirit Bodies entered the Divine Roaming Mirror, most likely to guard against Granny You.

After all, Granny You gave off a feeling of extreme danger. No one knew what she might do. If she damaged their bodies while they were inside the Divine Roaming Mirror, they might be trapped there forever, unable to return.

As she spoke, everyone found a stone chamber, took the restriction token from the door, and entered.

Gao Xueting did not rush in, but stood in place, explaining the use of the restriction token to everyone.

Soon, everyone understood. They immediately closed the stone chamber doors, activated the restriction tokens, and started the restrictions in their respective chambers.

After everyone was ready, Gao Xueting finally chose an empty stone chamber and entered. Before closing the door, she said, "I'll leave the rest to you, Granny!"

"No need for your nonsense!" Granny You replied.

Gao Xueting said no more and activated the restriction, waiting quietly.

After a while, Granny You, leaning on her cane, came to stand before the Divine Roaming Mirror. Suddenly she tossed aside her cane, spread her arms, and a vast, ocean-like Divine Sense poured into the Divine Roaming Mirror.

She muttered something under her breath, as if chanting a spell, but listening closely, it was impossible to make out the words.

As she did this, the Divine Roaming Mirror, which had been glowing, suddenly burst forth with dazzling light.

At that moment, Yang Kai and the others, who were sitting cross-legged in the stone chambers, were enveloped in light. Within that light, everyone felt an extremely uncomfortable sensation, as if their spirits were about to leave their bodies.

But no one resisted, because this was perfectly normal. Every martial artist who entered the Divine Roaming Mirror experienced this.

"Buzz..." The massive Divine Roaming Mirror suddenly began to spin, faster and faster, gradually forming a torrent of energy that swept in all directions. The cave was instantly filled with flying sand and rocks, and the debris struck the stone chambers and cave walls with cracking sounds.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Six streams of light shot out from six stone chambers, flying straight into the spinning Divine Roaming Mirror and disappearing.

At the same time, the surface of the Divine Roaming Mirror flashed with the images of Yang Kai and the others like lightning.

"Hm?" Granny You, who was casting the spell, suddenly had a sharp glint in her eyes, as if she had discovered something. She stared at the Divine Roaming Mirror and cried out in shock, "Impossible! Impossible! That boy actually has such a treasure on him? Did I see it wrong?"

As soon as she finished speaking, she clapped her hands together hard.

The spinning Divine Roaming Mirror immediately stabilized and returned to its original state.

But Granny You's face was deathly pale, her head covered in cold sweat, and her already hunched figure became even more bent, as if this activation had taken a huge toll on her.

"Damn it, damn it!" she howled, "Wen Zishan, the only reason you spared my life is because activating the Divine Roaming Mirror requires the Divine Sense of a Third Stage Emperor. Don't think I don't know your sinister intentions. One day, you'll pay the price!"

After saying this, she quickly sat down cross-legged, trembling, and took out some Spiritual Pills from her Spatial Ring, popping them into her mouth like candy.

"Whether this old woman saw wrong or not, I have to go in and check! If it really is that thing, Wen Zishan, you're finished, haha... hahahaha..." She muttered crazily for a while, then burst into manic laughter.

At the same time, at Ten Thousand Saints Peak, Wen Zishan gazed into the distance.

Chen Qian stood by his side.

When the Divine Sense fluctuation belonging to a Third Stage Emperor arrived, Chen Qian said, "It looks like Sister Gao and the others have gone in."

"Yes," Wen Zishan nodded, "Everything is going smoothly."

"Hall Master!" Chen Qian suddenly turned to Wen Zishan. "Actually, there's something I've never understood."
