## Chapter 987 — Land of Tenderness

Yang Kai had no idea what grudge those three held against the He sisters, He Miao and her sibling, but from their conversation he could infer that they were wary of the hidden dangers lurking in the Chaos Abyss.

So, after picking up some reliable information, they were eager to report back and put as much distance between themselves and this place as possible.

No matter where they intended to return, as long as he was with them, Yang Kai felt he could leave the starry void forbidden zone that had plagued him for so long.

Once off this place, he only needed a suitable moment to slip away from the three of them.

Yang Kai acted very cooperative the whole way, taciturn and withdrawn, which gradually loosened the trio’s vigilance toward him.

His cultivation at the First Stage of the Saint Realm made them truly unconcerned.

Their words inadvertently revealed some information: they belonged to a force called Purple Star, the burly man was named Liu Shan, the wiry, viper-like man was Liu Sha, and the beautiful woman the two addressed as Bi Ya.

The three of them rode Star Shuttles of higher grade than Yang Kai’s, and their speed through the starry sky was considerably faster.

Noticing this, Yang Kai privately congratulated himself; he felt his decision not to flee the moment he sensed their presence had been right, for even if he had tried to evade them then, he likely could not have outrun their pursuit.

They sped on for several days before Yang Kai could no longer restrain himself and asked the beautiful woman, “Where are we going now?”

“Don’t be impatient, you’ll see in a moment.” Bi Ya giggled softly and did not answer Yang Kai’s question.

Liu Sha glanced at Yang Kai with significant meaning, giving a low, chuckling laugh that carried a weighty implication.

“Look. Aren’t we here already?” Bi Ya suddenly pointed ahead, her eyes bright with excitement.

Following the direction she indicated, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed and he nearly cried out in surprise.

In a patch of dark, icy starry sky a vague, enormous silhouette was rushing toward them like some fierce beast; the shape was a hundred zhang in length, magnificent and imposing.

Though massive, its movement was uncanny and soundless. And exceedingly swift.

Seeing that gargantuan form, Liu Shan, Liu Sha, and Bi Ya all involuntarily showed a relaxed expression, as if a sense of coming home and safety had flooded over them.

Their movements within the Chaos Abyss had kept them uneasy and on edge.

“Ferocious Beast?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow and growled low, releasing his Divine Sense toward that direction. Yet what he perceived was that the massive, hazy figure held not the slightest trace of life. Instead, it radiated energy fluctuations akin to a Secret Treasure.

“A ferocious beast?” Bi Ya stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, covering her mouth with a coquettish laugh. “You’re adorable. How could that be a ferocious beast? That’s an Upper-Level Saint King-class warship of our Purple Star!”

“A warship?” Yang Kai was perplexed; his mind involuntarily recalled the ruined great ship he had seen in the forbidden area beneath the Demon Capital.

Liu Shan regarded Yang Kai thoughtfully, shook his head slowly and snorted with disdain.

Yang Kai’s remark instantly revealed that he must be from a lower-tier continent—otherwise he wouldn’t be unfamiliar with large Secret Treasures like warships.

When Yang Kai had given that answer earlier, Liu Shan hadn’t dug deeper because he hadn’t intended to leave Yang Kai alive. Now Liu Shan was sure this thick-headed youth truly came from a low-level continent.

As they drew closer, Yang Kai finally got a clear look at the thing he had mistaken for a ferocious beast.

A bronze great ship a hundred zhang in length, bearing some resemblance to the ruined vessel sealed under the Demon Capital, though this one was even larger.

Had the Bone Clan used vessels like this to reach the Tongxuan Continent thousands of years ago?

Yang Kai stood stunned and speechless for a long moment.

He suddenly realized his plan was likely to fail.

He had assumed the three would pilot Star Shuttles to leave the Chaos Abyss, so he’d played along to find a chance to escape. But now, facing such a colossal bronze great ship, Yang Kai felt his own insignificance.

If he boarded that bronze great ship with them, he would without a doubt become a fish in a barrel.

Inside, there would, without question, be experts of the Saint King Realm!

While his thoughts raced and he considered ways to get away, Liu Shan suddenly produced from his bosom a palm-sized, compass-like Secret Treasure.

The compass flickered with a faint light; his consciousness seeped into it as if to communicate with someone.

In a short while he put the treasure away, and with a sound, a seam opened along the bottom of the bronze great ship.

“Move!” Liu Shan beckoned and led the way, flying toward the seam first, with Liu Sha and Bi Ya close behind.

In an instant the three and Yang Kai dove into the crack and entered the ship’s interior.

After the trio set foot inside the bronze ship, the seam sealed itself automatically.

Yang Kai was dazzled, like a country bumpkin entering a prosperous metropolis—everything was new and astonishing.

His heart, however, sank bitterly, for the instant he stepped inside the great ship he sensed waves of overwhelmingly powerful life fluctuations and force emanating from all sides.

Most of those auras were of the Saint Realm, and a couple were so vigorous and dense that Yang Kai’s heart quivered with unease; he could not help but feel utterly powerless to resist.

Merely those emanations seemed capable of crushing his will.

Saint King Realm!

Indeed, the bronze great ship harbored Saint King Realm experts.

“Liu Shan, you’re late.” A Third Stage of the Saint Realm expert strode up and barked in a deep voice.

“We took a longer route, but we also gathered some intelligence.”

“Oh?” The man frowned. “What information?”

“Those two little bitches did come into the Chaos Abyss, and their Star Shuttle was damaged in the earlier battle; their star map failed, and now they’re lost here.”

“Where did this information come from? How credible is it?” a glint flickered in the man’s eye.

“This kid told us. He said he ran into the two sisters and that the crystal stones and pills they carried were taken, so I reckon those two won’t last long.” Liu Shan pointed at Yang Kai.

Only then did the man notice Yang Kai’s presence; he inspected him top to bottom and nodded indifferently. “Good. As long as they remain in the Chaos Abyss, they won’t escape our grasp. This intel must be reported to the Lord right away to decide what to do!”

“I’m heading there now. Want to come?” Liu Shan asked.

“Then let’s go together!”

Saying so, the two walked side by side deeper into the ship.

“I won’t go; I’ll take him back to rest first.” Bi Ya smiled lightly, hooking Yang Kai’s arm and leading him the other way.

Liu Shan frowned in displeasure but didn’t stop them; he merely warned, “Don’t play too wildly.”

“I know, I have restraint,” Bi Ya giggled.

Walking with Bi Ya through the ship’s cabins, she moved with practiced ease; she clearly knew the vessel’s interior intimately. They passed many martial artists—none below the Transcendent Realm, and Saint Realm practitioners were common.

Yet whenever these people saw Bi Ya, they avoided her in terror like scorpions, their expressions tense; only after she had passed did they relax.

When they glanced at Yang Kai, who was linked with her arm, pity and a touch of schadenfreude showed on every face.

Yang Kai felt an unpleasant sting in his heart.

He could almost predict what the beautiful woman intended to do with him, and from the looks of those martial artists it was easy to infer that if she did anything to him, the outcome would be dire.

Damn wench! Yang Kai cursed inwardly but kept his face composed, his mind racing as he memorized the route they took, etching it into his memory in the hope of finding a way out.

After a short while Bi Ya led Yang Kai to a side room and pushed the door open. She beckoned him in: “Come in.”

Yang Kai obediently entered and glanced around; this appeared to be Bi Ya’s quarters. A faint, pleasant fragrance filled the room—subtle and just right. Pink accents were everywhere, making the chamber warm and inviting, designed to make anyone who entered relax and lower their guards.

There was a small incense burner in the room burning an exotic scent; as Yang Kai inhaled it, he felt a subtle reaction in his body—his blood quickened and a deep, hidden instinct began to stir.

A faint redness crept into his clear eyes.

Soft whispers seemed to sound in his ears, those murmurs ensnaring and stealing his soul, making his breathing grow heavy.

Bi Ya had somehow moved before him; her peach-blossom eyes shone strangely as her delicate hand touched Yang Kai’s chest, a flush on her face that was irresistibly tempting.

She watched him with satisfaction, her hot body pressing forward; she let her full, firm breasts press into Yang Kai’s solid chest, ruby-red nipples quivering as muffled moans escaped her throat.

She gently shoved Yang Kai toward the fragrance-laden bed.

“What are you doing?” Yang Kai’s breathing came heavy like an ox’s; he stared at her stunned, like an inexperienced novice.

“Hee hee…” Bi Ya seemed delighted with Yang Kai’s reaction. Seeing a man’s reason and desire clash had always been her favorite sight; she relished breaking a man’s rationality and turning him into a creature of appetite, deriving great satisfaction from it.

Bi Ya advanced step by step, forcing Yang Kai back. Her breath smelled sweet as she murmured, “This is sister’s room; no one will come in. Do whatever you want.”

Her breathing grew heavier, her body writhing; the twin protrusions at her chest stiffened, and the rubbing against Yang Kai’s chest brought indescribable pleasure.

In that moment she seemed transformed into a wronged wife starved for desire.

Yang Kai collapsed onto the fragrant bed from momentum; she straddled him and without ceremony began to strip him.

Yang Kai swallowed continually as if already surrendered to her embrace; no longer questioning, he reached out with both hands toward her generous curves.
