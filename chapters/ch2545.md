## Chapter 2545 — Do You Recognize Me

"Speak, why did you ambush this Lord!" someone glared at the bitter melon-faced man, shouting sternly.

The bitter melon-faced man clenched his teeth, enduring the pain, but said nothing.

"Heh heh, looks like you’re a tough one. We’ll have to extract your soul and refine your spirit to get to the bottom of this." Another person sneered, approaching menacingly.

"Hahaha!" The bitter melon-faced man suddenly burst into wild laughter, so crazed that everyone was momentarily stunned.

After a moment, his laughter stopped, and he said coldly, "You want to extract my soul and refine my spirit? You’d better have the guts for it. Do you know which sect I come from? If you dare harm a single hair on me, your sects and families will know no peace!"

Hearing this, everyone’s expressions changed. The bitter melon-faced man acted as if he had a powerful background, and it really made the crowd hesitate.

Thinking it over, since he dared to ambush an Emperor Realm expert, he must have something to rely on. Maybe he really is a disciple of a top sect. Otherwise, why would he attack an Emperor Realm expert here for no reason?

Maybe Yang Kai has some grudge with that top sect, so this person came here to attack him.

Earlier, everyone was grateful to Yang Kai for saving their lives and didn’t think much about it. Now, looking back, they realized this whole situation was strange.

"Hahaha, scared?" The bitter melon-faced man took in everyone’s reactions and couldn’t help but sneer, "I advise you all to mind your own business and not meddle in others’ affairs. Go do what you need to do, and stop standing in my way..."

Pa—

Before he could finish, Zhang Ruoxi suddenly flashed in front of him and slapped him hard.

The bitter melon-faced man was stunned by the blow. Stars danced before his eyes, his head spun, and it took him a long time to recover. Under that slap, more than a dozen teeth flew out, and his mouth filled with blood.

Yang Kai was ambushed, and though he was unharmed, Zhang Ruoxi was furious. She never expected such an ungrateful person to exist—Yang Kai had just saved his life, and now he tried to kill him.

Such a person truly deserved no pity.

If she hadn’t suppressed her anger, that slap might have killed him.

The others feared the bitter melon-faced man, but Zhang Ruoxi had nothing to fear.

Perhaps because she was truly angry, a terrifyingly violent aura surged from Zhang Ruoxi’s body, making her look like a rampaging beast.

Everyone was stunned, staring at her in disbelief. No one expected this beautiful, fairy-like girl to have such a frightening side...

"The wind has died down, the Yin-Souls have dispersed. Farewell, everyone!" Yang Kai said calmly.

Hearing this, the others thought for a moment and understood what Yang Kai meant.

No matter what grudge existed between him and the bitter melon-faced man, or what background the bitter melon-faced man had, it was not for others to interfere, nor did he need anyone’s help.

Since they were wary, what was the point of staying here? Better to leave and avoid trouble.

Realizing this, someone cupped his fists and said, "I’ll never forget your kindness, Lord. I wish you great success in the Ancient Land. I’ll take my leave!"

With that, he swiftly darted out of the cave and soon disappeared into the strange mist.

With someone taking the lead, the rest quickly understood the situation and all bid farewell and left.

After a while, Yang Kai turned his head, looking with interest at Qi Hefeng. "You’re not leaving?"

Everyone else had left, but he stayed behind, making Yang Kai a bit curious.

Qi Hefeng shook his head. "I still have something to say to you, Lord."

Yang Kai chuckled, "You recognize me!"

This wasn’t a question, but a statement. Earlier, when Qi Hefeng introduced himself, he had glanced at Yang Kai, making Yang Kai suspect he was recognized. Now, he was certain—otherwise, why would Qi Hefeng stay behind alone?

Qi Hefeng smiled awkwardly, "You saw through me, Lord."

Yang Kai asked, "Did Qi Hai tell you?"

Qi Hefeng replied seriously, "Exactly, it was the Young Stronghold Master. After returning from the Shattered Star Sea some days ago, he gathered a few trusted people and showed us your image, telling us to keep an eye out for you. Because you told him in the Shattered Star Sea that you’d come to the Eastern Territory."

Yang Kai snorted, "I only said I’d come to the Eastern Territory, not the Ancient Land. Yet you happened to be waiting here—quite the coincidence."

Qi Hefeng said awkwardly, "Just so you know, Lord, the tavern in the Desolate City... is secretly run by my Qi Family."

Yang Kai understood. No wonder the tavern owner insisted on giving him ten jars of Barbaric Wild Wine before he left. Turns out, the Qi Family had already recognized him then.

"They sent word that you were entering the Ancient Land, so we came in early and spread out along the passage to wait!" Qi Hefeng explained, watching Yang Kai’s reaction, afraid to upset him.

Yang Kai was clearly displeased, his face cold. "Your Qi Family Stronghold really has a long reach."

Qi Hefeng looked terrified. "Please don’t be angry, Lord. We didn’t mean to track your movements, it’s just that the Young Stronghold Master..."

"I know!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "It’s the Heavenly Frost Earth Drizzle poison, isn’t it? Go back and tell Qi Hai—I can’t cure it. The antidote is no longer with me."

"Ah?" Qi Hefeng was shocked. "Then... where is it?"

"Why should I tell you?" Yang Kai’s eyes grew cold. The True Phoenix Fire was a serious matter. Yang Kai trusted Qi Hai not to reveal it, but if someone really wanted to know, they could figure it out by researching. Qi Hai’s urgent search for help was clearly related to the True Phoenix Fire.

That would only bring trouble upon himself.

So Yang Kai was very unhappy with Qi Hai’s actions this time. He hadn’t promised Qi Hai anything, only said he’d visit the Eastern Territory someday. Who knew it would lead to all this?

"I wouldn’t dare!" Qi Hefeng was alarmed, quickly cupping his fists and bowing his head.

"Enough, you can go. And tell Qi Hai—if he keeps trying to track me down, I’ll pay a personal visit to Qi Family Stronghold." Yang Kai waved impatiently.

Qi Hefeng’s face changed. The Qi Family Stronghold was powerful, but if they angered someone like Yang Kai, an Emperor Realm expert, their days would be hard. But he hadn’t completed the Young Stronghold Master’s task, so he didn’t know how to report back.

After thinking, he cupped his fists again. "Lord, there’s one more thing I must tell you."

Yang Kai looked at him coldly. "If it’s about the antidote, don’t bother. Say one more word and I’ll throw you out."

Qi Hefeng hurriedly said, "It’s not about the antidote, but about... that man!"

As he spoke, he pointed at the bitter melon-faced man.

Yang Kai asked in surprise, "You know his background?"

He was curious too. He’d just arrived in the Eastern Territory, barely entered the Ancient Land passage, and someone tried to kill him. What grudge could there be?

Qi Hefeng answered, "If I’m not mistaken, he’s from the Netherworld Sect!"

"Netherworld Sect!" Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he glanced at the bitter melon-faced man, whose face was twisted in pain, then looked back calmly. "How can you prove it?"

Qi Hefeng said, "A month ago, many Netherworld Sect disciples entered the Ancient Land passage. According to my family’s intelligence, they didn’t immediately enter the Ancient Land but lingered in the passage, seemingly waiting for someone. Their leader was a Netherworld Sect elder named Hua Feichen, who has the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivation."

"Hua Feichen..." Yang Kai murmured, unfamiliar with the name.

Qi Hefeng said, "You may not know Hua Feichen, Lord, but there’s another person you definitely won’t forget!"

"Who?"

"Yin Lesheng!"

Yang Kai’s brows rose, and he grinned. "He’s here too? Good, good, it really is a small world."

Qi Hefeng looked puzzled, not understanding why Yang Kai was so pleased. The Netherworld Sect brought many people this time, including a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert. Yang Kai might not be afraid, but why was he so happy?

He should only be a First Stage Emperor, since the Young Stronghold Master said that when he met Yang Kai in the Shattered Star Sea, he was only at the Third Stage Dao Origin Realm. Even if he gained some opportunity there and advanced to Emperor Realm, he couldn’t possibly be a match for an old expert like Hua Feichen.

"We didn’t know why the Netherworld Sect was lying in wait in the passage, but since Qi Family Stronghold is the local power, we paid extra attention. When you suddenly arrived at the Desolate City, the Young Stronghold Master realized the Netherworld Sect must be targeting you. After all, we heard you had a big falling out with Yin Lesheng in the Shattered Star Sea, maybe even a grudge. We don’t know how they learned you’d come to the Ancient Land and waited for you." Qi Hefeng looked confused.

"Of course they know." Yang Kai snorted.

The news about Xiaoxiao being in the Ancient Land was something Yin Lesheng himself had told Yang Kai.

Given how anxious he was, Yin Lesheng surely guessed Yang Kai would come to the Ancient Land to look for Xiaoxiao. All he had to do was gather people and wait—sooner or later, Yang Kai would show up.

Looks like last time in the Shattered Star Sea, Yin Lesheng suffered a big loss and has held a grudge ever since. Now that the Shattered Star Sea has only just closed, he couldn’t wait to set a trap for Yang Kai, determined to kill him.

As for the bitter melon-faced man, he was probably their informant outside, tracking Yang Kai’s movements. But eager to earn merit, he attacked when Yang Kai was exhausted, only to fail miserably.

"Let’s see how you die now!" Yang Kai sneered.

Last time, Yang Kai spared Yin Lesheng because he needed to find Xiaoxiao’s whereabouts. The two signed a Soul Contract, binding each other. Even if Yang Kai wanted to kill him, he couldn’t.

But now that Yin Lesheng has come to him, Yang Kai won’t be polite anymore.
