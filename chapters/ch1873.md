## Chapter 1873 — One Against Two

Although he had just tangled with Yang Kai, it had only been a skirmish and he hadn’t used his full strength; but now, in his bid to seize the Void Mind Crystal and break into the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, Gongsun Liang didn't hold back at all.

This strike was absolutely one hundred percent of his power, yet the opponent effortlessly warded it off.

More than that, a force flowed from the other side that he could hardly resist; under that pressure he felt like a lone little boat tossed on a vast sea in a storm, with waves crashing, always on the verge of capsizing.

Terror gripped Gongsun Liang as he desperately resisted the energy assault coming from Yang Kai and growled, "Brother Li, won't you make a move?"

He had no choice but to beg Li Maoming for help.

Li Maoming frowned and complained, "Why bother… why make things difficult…"

Though he voiced his complaints, he was forced to deploy his Domain Field and press toward Yang Kai.

After all, he owed Gongsun Liang a favor, and since Yang Kai had already returned the Venerable One token and was not Purple Star’s Venerable One, he felt no moral constraint about attacking him.

Yet from his heart he did not wish to fight a cultivator of equal realm, so his release of the Domain Field was only to pressure Yang Kai, not a real all-out effort.

Left and right, two Domain Fields of Second Stage Void Kings surged forward like two mountains pressing in, as if everything in the world would be crushed into powder.

The focal point of that compression was exactly where Yang Kai stood.

Yang Kai suddenly felt the pressure surge. Where he had originally held the upper hand, he was now forced to divert part of his strength to withstand Li Maoming’s Domain Field. Seeing this, Gongsun Liang immediately seized the initiative once more, pressing down so hard that Yang Kai’s body sank under the force.

He pressed down on Yang Kai and ground out through clenched teeth, "Young man, there’s a saying—those who know the times are heroes. Hand over that thing and I won’t trouble you further; I can even treat you as an honored guest of Purple Star. What say you?"

Yang Kai’s face looked strained, yet his bearing remained utterly at ease. He glanced leisurely at Gongsun Liang and said, “Why does it sound like you think you've won?”

Gongsun Liang laughed loudly, "Because I am already certain of victory!"

"Is… that so!" Yang Kai grinned, baring his white fangs. The moment the words left his mouth, his Domain Field thundered outward.

Hum…

A pulse stirred within his heart, and the surrounding space seemed to lose its stability, as if on the verge of shattering.

As if a great stone had been thrown into a placid lake, ripples formed in Yang Kai’s Domain Field, visible to the eye, and spread outward.

Crackle…

Fine, crisp sounds issued forth.

Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming both changed color; the former even cried out, "How is this possible?"

He was aghast to discover that under the combined pressure of his and Li Maoming’s Domain Fields, Yang Kai not only had not been suppressed but instead erupted, shattering their Domain Fields piece by piece.

Gongsun Liang’s heart trembled violently.

He had ascended to the Void King Realm a thousand years ago and broken through to the Second Stage three hundred years prior; he had dwelt in the Void King Realm for over a millennium, meaning his Domain Field had been tempered for a thousand years and he had unique insights into it—few in the entire Star Domain could surpass him.

Li Maoming was much the same.

Yet now, the sum of their Domain Fields was still less than that of this one man; to be undone when combining forces meant that his Domain Field’s might exceeded both of theirs.

This realization chilled Gongsun Liang to the core; his eyes brimmed with terror and his pupils trembled.

Only then did he realize Yang Kai had never used his full strength. He had already tried to overestimate Yang Kai’s power, but in the end he still found he had underrated the man.

"Not good!" Li Maoming cried, hastily withdrawing his Domain Field, his face ashen.

If a Domain Field were shattered, it was the cultivator’s foundation that suffered; if it broke beyond repair, it could cause a realm drop and decline in cultivation—something no Void King could bear.

Fortunately he acted quickly, or there would indeed have been danger.

Once his Domain Field withdrew, Gongsun Liang alone could not resist Yang Kai’s might; the air filled with countless ruptures, and along with those sounds Gongsun Liang’s body trembled violently, blood seeping from his eyes, nose, ears and mouth.

Those were the signs of a Domain Field refined for a thousand years being dismantled.

After this battle, even if Gongsun Liang did not die, repairing his Domain Field would require at least a century of seclusion.

But it was not over; Yang Kai fixed his gaze on the nearby Gongsun Liang, pressed the Dragon Bone Sword sharply down, and with a force that seemed able to rival creation itself, Gongsun Liang was sent flying like a torn hemp sack.

Roar…

A dragon’s cry rang through heaven and earth as the Dragon Bone Sword transformed into a jade-green giant dragon, its massive body swaying, two house-sized eyes glaring as it chased Gongsun Liang, jaws wide as if to swallow him whole.

"Dragon Bone Secret Treasure!" Gongsun Liang’s eyes nearly bulged out; though he had felt something exceptional when Yang Kai first produced the Dragon Bone Sword, he could never have imagined it was forged from dragon bone.

That was the skeleton of an Ancient Divine Spirit! A treasure crafted from it would at minimum be Void King-Grade.

That near-tangible Dragon Might crashed against Gongsun Liang’s soul and body, stirring an uncontrollable surge of fear and dread within him.

That fear was instinctual; none would stand before an Ancient Divine Spirit without feeling such emotion—something born in the blood itself.

He bit his tongue and forced away the unease, forming hand seals as Saint Yuan surged wildly.

In the next instant his short-sword secret treasure burst into light and, through a twisted metamorphosis, became a massive ribbonfish-like entity.

That ribbonfish-like being was brightly colored and dazzling, its saw-toothed fangs dense like a saw, and it charged straight at the jade-green giant dragon.

Two Void King-Grade secret treasures assumed forms and met in midair; violent energy fluctuations rippled out as Purple Star City shook, houses below crumbled as though eroded by ten thousand years, and the ground was furrowed with huge trenches.

The Origin Returning Realm warriors who had been watching nearby were struck like a blow; faces paling, they enacted defensive measures yet were still torn apart by the terrible aftershock of energy.

Only several elder-level Purple Star figures, relying on profound cultivation, remained standing. From their expressions it was clear it had not been easy to withstand the shock; each looked grave and none dared close their eyes, all carefully observing this epochal clash.

A clash between Second Stage Void King Realm experts was not something seen often; learning even a scrap from it would greatly benefit them.

Amid that titanic energy release, Yang Kai vanished like a specter, and when he reappeared he was already standing before Gongsun Liang.

"You…" Gongsun Liang’s face changed; at this moment his momentum had waned, and he never expected Yang Kai to appear before him now.

Yang Kai said nothing, his expression cold and resolute. Multicolored radiance shimmered on his fist as he drove a punch at Gongsun Liang.

Undying Five Elements Sword Body!

This peerless body-tempering method could both attack and defend—defensively it was as firm as a bastion, offensively nothing could stand against it. Yang Kai filled his fist with the qi of the Undying Five Elements Sword, making it rock-solid, almost like wearing a Void King-Grade secret treasure as a gauntlet.

If this punch struck, Gongsun Liang would certainly suffer grievous injury!

The punch did not swing fast, its path was perfectly clear, yet Gongsun Liang was stunned to find he could not block it.

This was already an absolute, overwhelming suppression of power — an assault he could not dispel by any means, no matter what technique he used.

At his prime he might have escaped with his body intact, but now his momentum was weak and his Domain Field damaged—how could he defend? He could only watch the five-colored fist swell in his vision, panic rising deep within.

At the crucial moment, a figure appeared before Gongsun Liang—it was Li Maoming!

Li Maoming’s face was solemn; he slapped his chest and spat out a wine gourd. Without thought he seized it, gulped hard, and then sprayed it toward Yang Kai.

Hss…

A blue flame spanned between Yang Kai and Li Maoming like a river of stars, cutting off Yang Kai’s attack.

The flame was not hot but horribly cold; the blue flame seemed to freeze the very heavens and earth.

The five-colored radiance on Yang Kai’s fist flickered as if about to be extinguished; at the same time a chill raced up his arm and struck at his heart.

Yang Kai could not help but shiver.

Looking at the wine gourd and the blue flame spanning before him, Yang Kai’s eyes brightened—he realized this was no ordinary treasure.

"Brother Yang, stop!" Li Maoming cried hurriedly as Yang Kai’s action was momentarily hindered.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and ignored Li Maoming, lowly calling, "Dragon Transformation!"

Crack…

One of his arms suddenly swelled in girth; under the unbelieving gazes of Li Maoming and Gongsun Liang, plates of dragon scales formed on the arm from condensed Saint Yuan, and the hand became a dragon claw, hideous and fierce. The Golden Sacred Dragon qi radiating from that arm made both men’s hearts quake.

The blue flame that had stood between them was easily breached; it clung to the dragon scales on Yang Kai’s arm and burned fiercely, yet it could not harm him.

Li Maoming and Gongsun Liang’s eyes throbbed; without thinking they both struck, combining their forces into an assault nearly as fierce as a Third Stage Void King’s, aimed squarely at that terrifying dragon claw.

Boom…

In the void, lights birthed and died as energy detonations rose in succession; a vast halo spread through the air, a scene of impending doom unfurled before everyone’s eyes.

The three figures were hurled backward together.
