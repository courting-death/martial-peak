## Chapter 732 — Take a Look Around

Seeing Yang Kai severely wounded, Qian Yue could not help a look of relief wash across her face.

She knew she was in the wrong this time; denying Su Yan's existence and preventing Yang Kai from meeting her had been driven by selfish motives, so even though Yang Kai shattered more than a dozen ice mountains, she did not strike to kill.

She only wanted to force him to retreat.

Su Yan could not be handed over lightly—having finally met such an outstanding person, Qian Yue had even entertained the idea of taking her as a disciple.

Besides, Su Yan was not in a condition to be seen right now.

She intended only to wound him and drive him away; thinking this, Qian Yue had not yet flown over to check on Yang Kai when her expression shifted again.

Below, Yang Kai, who should have been grievously injured and unconscious, once more surged up wrapped in brilliant golden True Yuan.

"Impossible!" Qian Yue's beautiful eyes trembled violently; she knew how much power she'd used a moment ago — a First Stage of the Transcendent Realm young man simply could not have withstood it.

Yet now he looked only slightly harmed; his momentum had not waned but instead grown more violent, as if he would not rest until the Ice Sect was razed to the ground.

How tough was his body to bear such a blow without losing consciousness?

Boom... boom... boom...

One ice mountain after another continued to collapse; Qian Yue, hysterical and like a madwoman, screamed, "Brat, you are courting death—don't blame me if I show no mercy."

Yang Kai laughed wildly, "If you can kill me, then by all means try—let's see whether I die first or your Ice Sect's foundation is destroyed! You won't let me see Su Yan? Then I'll have you all accompany me to the grave!"

"Impudent!" Qian Yue snapped; seeing that about a tenth of the Ice Sect's holdings had truly been destroyed, she finally entertained murderous intent.

If they did not finish this brat off, at his rate of destruction the Ice Sect would need to find a new place to move within an hour.

Such tremendous commotion naturally alarmed the other members of the Ice Sect.

One by one, experts erupted from different ice mountains and gathered together.

"Qian Yue, what's going on? Where did this barbarous brat come from?" a middle-aged man asked coldly, his face dark.

"Eldest Brother, detain this brat for me first, we'll talk about this later!" Qian Yue shouted hurriedly as she pursued Yang Kai's swift figure.

The middle-aged man frowned; though somewhat unwilling to move against a youth, seeing such wanton destruction of the Ice Sect enraged him, and he nodded, "Very well!"

As he spoke he shifted and blocked Yang Kai's path, barking coldly, "Brat, cease at once..."

Before he had finished, Yang Kai, wrapped in a fierce gale, swept past him.

A thunderous crash sounded as the ice mountain behind the middle-aged man shattered in an instant.

"Truly arrogant!" the middle-aged man snorted coldly; without any visible movement he inexplicably appeared at Yang Kai's side and pointed a finger, striking Yang Kai's flank.

Yang Kai's face turned pale; his forward momentum suddenly faltered, and at the same time an extremely chilling energy spread from the struck spot into his body, slowing the circulation of his True Yuan as if his form had sunk into a quagmire, unable to move.

To the naked eye, a thin layer of frost formed over Yang Kai's body, even his hair frozen solid.

Saint Realm — Second Stage!

A chill seized Yang Kai's heart; he forced his body to twist and hurriedly evaded the middle-aged man.

True Yuan surged violently within him, quickly dispelling the chill in body and mind, and in the next moment he regained his freedom.

The middle-aged man's face showed surprise and he gave a soft exclamation, "What a formidable brat!"

With his cultivation at the Saint Realm — Second Stage, injecting an ice-sealing True Yuan into an opponent's body would freeze and bind any ordinary person; yet this fellow was barely impeded before recovering.

He had already strained himself to the utmost with that one strike; to strike again would be inappropriate.

Experts of his standing, confident in their status, generally did not take pleasure in bullying the weak.

"Eldest Brother, aren't you going to act?" Qian Yue urged when she saw the middle-aged man standing midair with his hands behind his back, radiating a superior demeanor.

The middle-aged man frowned and said in a low voice, "What has this come to? Brat, you stop as well. I will not strike you further, but do not be too presumptuous. If there's anything, let's sit down and talk."

As he spoke, two other Saint Realm experts of the Ice Sect had already sealed off Yang Kai's path of retreat; these two made no move to attack, instead wearing leisurely expressions as they watched him with keen curiosity.

Four Saint Realm experts!

One could glimpse the Ice Sect's formidable strength.

Yang Kai stood at the center of the encirclement; knowing that with such a formation he could no longer act recklessly, and sensing the middle-aged man's sincerity, he leisurely halted his movement and hovered in midair.

"What is there to discuss?" Yang Kai asked the middle-aged man with a detached expression.

The middle-aged man smiled faintly and nodded, "I am an elder of the Ice Sect — Qian Hao!"

Yang Kai glanced at the middle-aged beauty and sneered, "She's an Ice Sect elder as well—how am I to know you two aren't acting together?"

Qian Yue's pretty face went cold; as she was about to speak, Qian Hao interrupted with a smile, "She and I are siblings—do you think we're in cahoots?"

"Eldest Brother!" Qian Yue glared at him with resentment.

"But you have no choice," Qian Hao's expression darkened. "You've destroyed so much of my Ice Sect's holdings and give me no account—do you think I will let you go? You'd better have a reason, or I will make you taste every human torment and thoroughly torture you to death."

Yang Kai sneered, withdrew his Wind-and-Thunder Wings, glanced at Qian Yue and said, "I'm looking for someone; she has gone to great lengths to keep me from seeing her."

"Looking for someone? Who?" Qian Hao frowned.

"Su Yan."

At the mention, Qian Hao and the other two Saint Realm experts raised their brows.

"Eldest Brother, this person should be the one the old man mentioned before," Qian Yue whispered into Qian Hao's ear. Qian Hao nodded slightly in understanding and displeasure, "If that's the case, why didn't you let him see her? Why cause such a commotion?"

"Su Yan... had an accident," Qian Yue said awkwardly.

"An accident?" Qian Hao was astonished. "What happened?"

Although Qian Hao was an elder of the Ice Sect, he had spent recent years in seclusion and was not fully aware of affairs within the Sect; if Yang Kai had not made such a racket today, he would not have been roused.

"Ah, that matter can wait; I'll explain it later when there's time. But Su Yan is indeed not in a state to be seen, and this brat is violent and cruel—clearly not a good sort. How could I let Su Yan associate with someone like him?"

"They are old acquaintances," Qian Hao sighed deeply.

"I think it's a toad wanting swan meat," Qian Yue snorted coldly, her gaze toward Yang Kai growing ever more disdainful.

Seeing his sister's poor impression of the brat, Qian Hao did not press further. In any case, though his sister had erred first, the brat had shown too little regard for the Ice Sect, destroying so many ice mountains at once; if the matter were quietly dismissed, it would be hard to explain to the disciples.

Thinking this, Qian Hao said coldly, "Just because of this you make such a scene, even to the point of destroying my Ice Sect's holdings?"

"I'm not pleased, so no one else can be!"

"You're arrogant enough, but can you bear the consequences? I will not kill you; I'll give you two choices: either enter my Ice Sect as a slave to repay the damage you've caused, or I will cut off both your hands. Choose."

Having said that, he stared coldly at Yang Kai to see which choice he would make.

"I choose neither."

Qian Hao smiled and shook his head, "That decision is not yours to make. Hmm, seeing your aptitude, we'll pick the first option for you. Although your cultivation method conflicts with our Ice Sect, you are still a talent—it's a pity to waste you like this."

As he spoke, an invisible energy suddenly erupted, directly binding Yang Kai.

Yang Kai made no attempt to dodge the restraint; he allowed himself to be bound, not panicking but wearing an expression of confident victory, a faint, cold smile on his face.

"What are you smiling at?" Qian Hao frowned. "From now on, you'll stay by my side and serve me—don't worry, I will not mistreat you. As a slave of the Ice Sect, someday you'll be able to see the person you wish to, provided you behave honestly—otherwise you'll suffer."

"You want me to serve you?" Yang Kai laughed out loud. "You don't have that luck!"

Qian Hao snorted coldly, "Having you serve me is me doing you a favor—don't be ungrateful."

Another Saint Realm expert shouted, "Yes, brat, Brother Qian Hao does have an eye for talent—don't be unappreciative."

The last man also said, "Angering Brother Qian Hao will do you no good."

Qian Hao appraised Yang Kai with interest and smiled, "I don't care what you came to the Ice Sect for, nor what grievances you suffered, but the fact is you ran rampant here. Not killing you is already my greatest mercy. Tell me, at this point, what leverage do you have to bargain? Do you think, with your strength, you can escape my hands?"

"Take a look around!" Yang Kai said with a mocking smile curling his lips, lightly reminding them.

At his words, the four Saint Realm experts all showed odd expressions and examined the surroundings.

The next moment, all four of their faces changed drastically.

From earlier they had sensed something off, but everyone's attention had been fixed on Yang Kai, and they had not investigated further.

Now, at Yang Kai's reminder, upon checking they were horrified to find the area eerily silent; almost all the Ice Sect disciples who had been driven out of the ice mountains gave not a sound.

Moreover, those Ice Sect disciples all wore expressions of agony and lay unconscious.
