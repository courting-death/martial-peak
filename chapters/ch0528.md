## Chapter 528 — Divine Roaming Realm

Not only that, his body continuously emitted a malevolent energy.

With each breath, an eerie balance was reached within his energy.

Everyone’s expressions changed; they were secretly startled and could not fathom how a True Yuan Realm cultivator’s ascension to the Divine Roaming Realm could bring about such a grand and awe-inspiring spectacle.

“What a promising talent, truly a promising talent!” The plump elder’s eyes gleamed as he murmured repeatedly, seemingly regretting that no such figure had appeared in his own clan.

But when he recalled Yang Liting’s previous attitude and actions, the elder secretly felt pity for Yang Kai.

The cold detachment of the Yang Family’s kinship—he wondered if it might dishearten this young man.

If this youth were his own junior disciple, he would surely cherish him dearly, impart all his lifelong knowledge, and provide any resources he desired from the family!

The head of the Yang Family was nothing; judging by this posture, one day he would definitely rise to the very pinnacle of this world. When that day came, what significance would the heads of the Eight Great Families, Grand Elders, or even those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm hold before him?

Yang Liting really was a damn fool! The plump elder seethed quietly to himself.

Yang Kai’s consciousness was immersed in his mind, muddled and confused. Darkness surrounded him, like the War City shrouded by demonic energy and dense black clouds.

Even darker than the current War City—a darkness utterly devoid of light.

It was as if before heaven and earth had opened, emptiness blanketing all, nothing existing within.

Yet peculiar changes were quietly unfolding. In the darkness, some power seemed to be silently gathering, like seeds buried beneath the soil, about to sprout and grow.

How long had passed, no one knew, when suddenly a glimmer of light burst forth in the dark. Weak as a firefly, flickering like a candle in the storm, it flashed and disappeared.

But that sudden light dispelled all the darkness in that instant.

Yang Kai’s spirit was drawn there. In the depths of his being, he sensed something pulling his attention. Concentrating fully, he blurred into that direction, hazily seeing a faint outline.

Another flicker of light emerged—this time with a color slightly different from before.

The next moment the light vanished again, and Yang Kai’s soul no longer remained calm. With every flicker, subtle and profound ripples arose.

A third color of light appeared, then a fourth... a fifth...

When all five colors had appeared, the process cycled endlessly. Delicate, faint lights sprouted like fresh shoots after rain, delicately pushing aside the soil, attempting to tear through this chaotic darkness.

The five-colored light flickered faster and brighter, and Yang Kai’s soul ripples gradually grew stronger. The chaotic dark space seemed unable to endure further; the five lights now continually illuminated it.

Suddenly, all five colors shone simultaneously. A five-colored lotus, radiating gentle light, materialized before Yang Kai’s eyes, spinning round and round.

Yang Kai’s spirit shook.

The Warm Spirit Lotus!

This supreme treasure that nourished Divine Sense had finally revealed its full form, spinning continuously. As it rotated, strands of wispy energy emanated from within it, spreading outward at an incredible speed, soon filling the entire dark space, imbuing it with abundant vitality where there had been none.

These wispy strands of energy were the power of his own Divine Sense! Yang Kai suddenly understood.

When he ascended to the True Yuan Realm, Yang Kai had already cultivated Divine Sense power.

But Divine Sense, like True Yuan, was intangible and formless. Both needed a place of storage and a carrier. True Yuan was stored in the Dantian and meridians; Divine Sense was stored within the Sea of Consciousness.

But Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness was not yet formed, and the Warm Spirit Lotus served as this carrier.

Now, Yang Kai was relying on the Divine Sense power he had cultivated over countless years to open his own Sea of Consciousness.

Subtle, nearly imperceptible strands of Divine Sense power were continuously released. As these wisps spread out, Yang Kai felt himself breaking free from certain restraints; his Divine Sense power began to grow exponentially.

Though the Warm Spirit Lotus was precious, it was still a mere external object—a carrier for Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

Through this carrier, he could use Divine Sense, but it could never unleash its full potential. Now that this carrier had fulfilled its purpose as a middleman, his Divine Sense power was able to fully evolve.

An intense ripple of spiritual power suddenly burst from his mind, quickly filling the entire War City.

The strong warriors gathered around him all changed color, shaken by the overwhelming strength of this Divine Sense ripple. Each cast sideways glances in surprise.

The warriors of the Eight Great Families wore extremely solemn expressions, but Meng Wuya and Ling Taixu looked on with astonished satisfaction and uplifted spirits.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense power had exceeded what his current cultivation level should possess, far surpassing any cultivator of his rank.

Inside his mind, the Five-Colored Warm Spirit Lotus continued to spin relentlessly. The Divine Sense power stored within it was incessantly released as delicate wisps.

Time passed.

At a certain moment, the Divine Sense energy stored in the Warm Spirit Lotus finally burst out in full.

The once chaotic and dark space was now densely filled with delicate, softly glowing strands, thick and viscous like a swamp.

Yang Kai clearly saw the soul strands undergo a miraculous transformation under some mysterious force.

The strands lit up, pulling and converging with one another, gradually growing stronger and more potent—pulling and converging again; the cycle repeated endlessly.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but recall the time in Tang Yuxian’s Sea of Consciousness, where he witnessed her demonstrating the opening of the Sea of Consciousness. Compared to his current state, the difference was clear.

Tang Yuxian’s Sea of Consciousness opening had been painstaking and slow, a patient and gradual process.

Whereas his current progress was a full bloom: rapid and fierce.

Within the chaotic space, Divine Sense power gathered everywhere—quantity transforming into quality, at an extraordinary speed.

Suddenly, the sound of flowing water emerged. Yang Kai focused his mind and saw streams of clear, river-like liquid converging from all directions toward the center—that was where the Warm Spirit Lotus resided!

The converging streams became a creek, then a river, then a lake, quickly swelling into an ocean.

The wind rose, whipping waves three feet high. Within that sea swelled Yang Kai’s terrifying Divine Sense power.

The Warm Spirit Lotus floated serenely above the ocean, casting a five-colored gentle radiance that enveloped the entire sea. The water was crystal clear to the bottom. At a thought, Yang Kai had the dull ocean sprout countless reefs; waves crashed against the reefs, scattering into froth and spray.

Suddenly, strange fish swam through the water; birds flew overhead. This fragment of the world suddenly became vibrant and vivid.

The sea breeze brushed across his face, tranquil and naturally serene.

Yang Kai’s spiritual form hovered in midair, quietly observing it all, his emotions stirring.

Reaching out with a finger, the Warm Spirit Lotus transformed suddenly into a solitary island in the sea, glowing with brilliant five-colored light, dazzling like a treasured isle!

Everything here was molded at will by Yang Kai—manifested by his Divine Sense power.

The next moment, Yang Kai suddenly felt something deep within his spirit sinking into the ocean.

Upon closer inspection, he realized it was his own memories.

His Sea of Consciousness contained a lifetime of experience, filled with the traces of his years of existence, countless moments and insights, cultivation methods and martial skills, trials endured—all of it, minute and vast, recorded here.

Casually glancing, Yang Kai saw fragments of past events play before him as if replaying scenes, crystal clear—like reliving them once more.

A cultivator’s Sea of Consciousness houses all their secrets; no one would ever open their defenses lightly for others to peek inside.

It was tantamount to baring oneself utterly before another.

Shan Qingluo had once allowed Yang Kai to see hers, proving she was completely unguarded toward him.

The Sea of Consciousness was now complete!

At this moment, a strange feeling welled inside Yang Kai.

In the mysterious depths, it seemed as if he had climbed another great height on the rugged path of the martial way.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes, which now shone with sharp brilliance, piercing as that of a hawk.

Everyone was shocked, their expressions heavy with gravity.

Yang Kai’s eyes immediately met the gentle gazes of Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya, who smiled at him with satisfaction.

He nodded at them, gratitude shining on his face.

Though he had just undergone a breakthrough, Yang Kai still sensed their arrival and knew what efforts they had made for him.

His heart felt warm.

His Master truly supported him unconditionally, believing in him without question!

Taking a deep breath, he retracted the Divine Sense ripples he had released, and his entire being instantly fell into a calm, unremarkable state—like an ordinary man who had never cultivated—save for the malevolent energy still radiating from his body.

The black clouds above still lingered. The terrifying heavenly and earthly pressure continued its baptism of Yang Kai’s body. Even though the Sea of Consciousness was formed, the body’s baptism was not yet complete.

“Are you a man or a demon now?” Yang Liting demanded coldly.

Yang Kai glanced indifferently at him and answered his question with action.

Once regaining control of his body, under Yang Kai’s deliberate management, the devouring power of his Proud Bone Golden Body grew immensely stronger than before.

Suddenly, a fierce wind swept across the War City. Centered on Yang Kai’s body, a powerful suction spread outward, pulling all the malevolent energy floating around back to him.

Even the heavenly and earthly power hidden within the heavy clouds above could not escape.

A violent tornado formed. Yang Kai stood calm in its center. The swirling clouds were drawn into the vortex, vanishing into Yang Kai’s body.

In less than fifteen minutes, the War City brightened suddenly; the sky cleared, vast and cloudless, pure azure. The oppressive malevolent aura that weighed on everyone’s hearts vanished without a trace.

An invisible wave of energy surged outward from beneath Yang Kai’s feet, raising dust and smoke ten thousand zhang high.
