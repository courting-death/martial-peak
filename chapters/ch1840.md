## Chapter 1840 — This Is the Explanation

“Is that supposed to be funny?” the city gate guard asked, still smiling as he looked at Yang Kai.

“Are you telling a joke?” Yang Kai squinted at him, only to find the man calmly returning his gaze without a hint of fear.

Five thousand, ten thousand—numbers like that of Saint Crystal meant little to Yang Kai. He had the backing of the mighty Lingxiao Sect and was used to killing and taking plunder; the Spatial Ring in his possession held, if not several hundred million, at least one hundred million Saint Crystals.

But the guard’s brazen, presumptuous attitude prickled at him.

“Do you think I’m joking with you? Boy, could you be a spy sent by the enemy force to our Purple Star City?” the gate guard snorted coldly, the pass token in his hand tapping his palm as he looked at Yang Kai with unmistakable menace.

Those queued up behind them all changed color at that remark.

They had seen the fate of that middle-aged man with their own eyes not long ago—barely half a teacup of time had passed—and now this young man in fine clothes might be headed for the same end?

One after another, their looks softened with pity as they turned to Yang Kai.

“When one seeks to frame another, excuses are never lacking!” As Yang Kai bristled, preparing to make a scene, someone suddenly stepped out from behind and gently shoved him forward, standing before the gate guard with a bright smile. “Sir, you must be joking—there’s no way he’s a spy. He’s with our Commerce Guild; he came with me on business.”

At that, the gate guard froze for a moment, and even Yang Kai was taken aback.

He frowned and glanced at the person standing before him, only to realize it was a woman. With her back to him he hadn’t seen her face clearly, but a mass of black hair was gathered into a bun, revealing a long, fair neck. She wore a well-cut long dress that outlined a slender waist and a neat, enticing rear.

At a time like this, someone was willing to speak up for him?

Yang Kai felt a strange flutter and found himself warming to the woman a little.

“Chairwoman!” several surprised exclamations rose from the crowd behind, laced with panic. One of them rushed forward and began to say, “He—”

“Shut up!” the woman snapped, turning to glare at the speaker.

She clearly carried authority among that group; at her word the man fell silent, though he still glared furiously at Yang Kai. The other women accompanying her wore similarly sullen expressions.

“Sir, please see it for yourself. Our Commerce Guild does frequently come to Purple Star City to trade. He is no spy—just an immature youth. If he offended you in any way, Youmeng is willing to apologize on his behalf; please accept our apology.” As she spoke she produced a pouch from her Spatial Ring and placed it in the guard’s hand.

Immature youth… Yang Kai couldn’t help touch his nose.

The guard weighed the pouch, his eyes lighting up as he chuckled. “The Commerce Guild? I’ve heard of you. Your Guild Leader is called Hua Youmeng? Could you be her?”

The woman smiled faintly. “A humble name—never expected to be heard by you, sir. I am truly honored.”

“Well, well.” The guard’s eyes shone as he leered at Hua Youmeng. “Since Guild Leader Hua is personally here and you’ve paid enough Saint Crystals, perhaps some leniency can be arranged.”

“Thanks, sir!” Hua Youmeng was elated.

“However…” the guard’s tone froze and his cold eyes swept to Yang Kai. “If Guild Leader Hua can agree to two conditions, I’ll let this matter drop—otherwise… hmph!”

Hua Youmeng’s smile stiffened and she answered softly, “Please speak, sir.”

“First, that brat’s expression—I don’t like it. He dared mock me earlier; he should apologize to me.” The guard sneered at Yang Kai, then turned his gaze to Hua Youmeng and leered. “And second, since Guild Leader Hua traveled so far, after the sunset I’ll be free. I’d like to host a welcome and send-off for you—will you honor me? Let it be at the Drunken Wind Pavilion in the east of the city.”

Although he framed it as a question, his tone left no room for refusal.

Hua Youmeng’s face changed slightly; she forced a smile and said, “Can we postpone that to another day? I’ll have this youth apologize to you now.”

As she spoke she kept shooting glances at Yang Kai.

Only then did Yang Kai see her face properly.

He couldn’t help but be struck—Hua Youmeng wasn’t the kind who would topple the hearts of all men, but she was pleasing to the eye, radiating a mature charm likely honed from years of managing the Commerce Guild’s affairs. She exuded an inexplicable aura and, close up, a scent that was intoxicating.

It was not the smell of cosmetics but a natural body fragrance.

No wonder the gate guard had been leering at her; that was the reason.

At that moment Hua Youmeng kept sending him furtive signals, and the other Commerce Guild warriors glared at Yang Kai as if daring him to refuse—ready to rough him up if he disobeyed.

Yang Kai smiled helplessly.

He had not expected entering a city would cause such trouble.

Still, it wasn’t the time to pick a fight; Hua Youmeng had stepped forward to help him, after all.

After a moment’s thought, Yang Kai cupped his fist to Hua Youmeng and said, “Guild Leader Hua, I appreciate your kindness.”

Hua Youmeng’s brows knotted slightly as a bad premonition flashed through her mind.

Sure enough, Yang Kai continued, “But since this matter arose because of me and has nothing to do with you, please step aside, Guild Leader Hua.”

With that he ignored her surprise and gave the gate guard a mocking grin. “You want me to apologize to you?”

“Guild Leader Hua, what is the meaning of this? It looks like this brat isn’t from your Commerce Guild! Are you lying to deceive us? Do you know what punishment you deserve?” the gate guard snapped at Hua Youmeng, showing no respect for Yang Kai.

Hua Youmeng hadn’t expected her favor to be unappreciated; sweat beaded on her brow as she hurried to explain, “Sir, please listen—this youth, he—”

“There’s nothing to explain. Guild Leader Hua, you’re in big trouble. If you can’t give me a reasonable account, don’t expect to get off lightly!” the guard barked, leaving Hua Youmeng no face as her cheeks drained of color.

“There truly isn’t anything to explain.” Yang Kai sneered, stepped forward, and struck out at the gate guard.

Slap— the guard was slapped so hard he tumbled and somersaulted, spitting blood, half his teeth nearly knocked out, his mouth filled with gore.

“That’s the explanation!” Yang Kai said coolly, his gaze icy.

“Ah?” Hua Youmeng froze—she felt in her gut that she had truly gotten herself into grave trouble and panic surged through her; she had no idea what to do.

“Y-you dare hit me?” the gate guard staggered up, clutching his jaw, words slurred as he spat out his indignation. Fury and malice flashed in his eyes. “I am a Purple Star City guard—how dare you strike me?”

Before he finished, Yang Kai swept another palm through the air.

A miserable shriek escaped as the guard’s remaining teeth were all knocked out.

“What nerve!” Deacon Min, who had been quietly resting with his eyes closed, finally moved. He launched himself like a hawk and flew above Yang Kai, releasing the Shi of a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm as he struck down with a palm, enveloping Yang Kai in a ten zhang radius and driving the blow.

Hua Youmeng and the Commerce Guild warriors all stifled sounds, their bodies shrinking under that massive pressure; their Saint Yuan could not circulate and two of the weaker ones coughed up blood on the spot.

“How dare you attack someone in our Purple Star City? Do you think this old man here means nothing?” Deacon Min roared, murderous intent filling him, his palm poised to kill Yang Kai.

“Who do you think you are? As if I should pay you any mind?” Yang Kai sneered. “I had no desire to make trouble, but you bullied people with your position—so you brought this on yourself.”

With that he flipped his palm out.

Boom—

The two palms collided and a tremendous burst of energy radiated outward. The murderous look evaporated from Deacon Min’s face, replaced by sudden panic, and he was sent flying like a torn sack.

The sound of bones cracking came from his body as he sailed through the air, bleeding profusely.

A commotion rose outside the gate.

Yang Kai’s clash with the city guard, Hua Youmeng’s intervention—everyone had watched it all unfold. They had expected Yang Kai to be in dire straits, yet the ones struck down were the gate guard and Deacon Min.

A single palm had hurled Deacon Min away; he crashed to the ground, life and death unknown.

The crowd stared at Yang Kai as if he were a monster.

Although Deacon Min’s position in Purple Star wasn’t the highest, he was still a Deacon, and anyone holding such a post in a behemoth like Purple Star City was at the very least a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert.

To be sent flying by a Third Stage and be that grievously injured—what level of cultivation must that youth possess? Could he be a Void King Realm cultivator?

That thought chilled everyone and they could no longer remain calm.

After all, a Void King Realm expert was the top-tier combat power in the entire Star Domain; even mighty Purple Star would not lightly provoke such a being.

Everything had happened so fast that no one’s mind could keep up. Guild Leader Hua Youmeng’s pretty mouth hung open, her eyes full of shock as she remained stunned for a long while.

There had originally been more than a dozen guards at the gate ready to follow Deacon Min’s lead and seize Yang Kai and the Commerce Guild members. But seeing Deacon Min defeated and possibly dead, none dared move forward. They froze, exchanging nervous looks, fearful Yang Kai might take a life.

Yang Kai finally reached out and drew back the pouch of Saint Crystals he had paid and Hua Youmeng’s bag into his hand, snorting coldly. “I offered you five thousand and you refused. Since you didn’t want them, I’ll take them back. Guild Leader Hua, this is yours.”

With that he tossed the bag back to Hua Youmeng.

She took it foolishly, feeling for reasons she could not explain that the pouch was unbearably hot to the touch.
