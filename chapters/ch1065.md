## Chapter 1065 — Moon Slaves, Forget It

Lin Mufeng stared anxiously as Yang Kai put away that small vial of Snow Pool Crystal Essence, his face writhing with heartache.

Yang Kai pretended not to see it.

Before Yang Kai could speak again, the middle-aged woman whose name he did not know smiled first and said, "I don’t have as many treasures as those two, but I do have something that can improve cultivation efficiency. If you don’t mind, Young Brother, take it."

As he spoke, several small flag-like objects suddenly appeared in his hand. Each flag was of a different color—red, orange, yellow, green, and so on—seven in total, each radiating a dense fluctuation of Spiritual Qi.

"A Secret Treasure?" Yang Kai was slightly puzzled. He didn’t know what use this Secret Treasure had to actually increase cultivation efficiency.

"These Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags are an Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure. Arranged according to a certain method, they can gather Spiritual Qi. I used them all the time in my early cultivation, but later, as my realm improved, I put them away. They haven’t been used for nearly a hundred years. Now they’re just right to gift to Young Brother."

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up again. He secretly thought that these few truly were the top managers of the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch—anything they casually took out was not something an ordinary person could hope to encounter. Who knew how many more rare treasures they had tucked away.

This time he wasn’t as impatient as the previous two times. He carefully received the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags from the middle-aged woman’s hand and offered polite thanks.

The middle-aged woman pursed her lips in a light smile. "Relax the defenses of your Sea of Consciousness, and I’ll impart the arrangement method to you!"

Yang Kai nodded. The woman extended a jade-like finger and tapped his forehead. In an instant, all the wondrous uses of the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags were laid bare to Yang Kai, and he grasped them thoroughly.

After carefully savoring the method, Yang Kai was greatly satisfied with the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags.

Though this thing was only an Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure, for the current Yang Kai it was an extremely rare and fine item. He could use it for a long time; and on the day he no longer needed it, he could pass it on to someone close to him.

It was not more precious than the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid and the Snow Pool Crystal Essence, but it was far more practical than those two.

The three had all paid dearly, and each had put in no small amount of thought. Yang Kai cupped his fists and said, "Many thanks for the assistance. This junior is endlessly grateful."

"No need for courtesy!" Halika laughed heartily. "So long as we can awaken Lady Xue, what does it matter if we bankrupt ourselves?"

He wore the look of loyalty and righteousness. Who knew how much of it was genuine.

"How about… Young Brother takes two Moon Slaves as well?" Lin Mufeng suddenly remembered something and proposed it.

"Moon Slaves?" Yang Kai frowned, looking at them suspiciously.

The middle-aged woman’s face flushed red. She spat, "You bastard. The Young Brother is so young, and instead of teaching him proper conduct, you’re teaching him crooked ways. When Lady Xue wakes up, how will you explain yourself?"

Lin Mufeng looked embarrassed. "Two Moon Slaves shouldn’t be a problem, right? I see Young Brother as a man of firm will. He won’t delay his future over a mere pair of Moon Slaves."

"Mm, two really aren’t an issue," Halika echoed from the side.

"What are Moon Slaves?" Seeing them speak one after another, Yang Kai’s curiosity swelled and he asked.

Halika cleared his throat lightly and explained, "Moon Slaves are a class of women our Commerce Guild cultivates specially. They train in special cultivation methods and take special Pills. At a certain time, they can couple with a man. Their primordial yin contains extremely pure energy. Any man who takes them for the first time can obtain tremendous benefits from it! If Young Brother wants to increase his strength quickly, Moon Slaves are the best choice."

"Harvesting yin to replenish yang?" Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly.

"No, no, no!" Lin Mufeng waved a hand with a smile. "The method our Commerce Guild developed isn’t the ordinary harvesting yin to replenish yang. You also know that many cultivators who practice heretical arts use that method and advance quickly, but the power gained that way is mixed and impure. Their combat strength ends up far below that of cultivators of the same realm. Our Commerce Guild would never do such a thing. The Moon Slaves we select are all women with excellent aptitude and physiques, then we raise them through special means. When the energy in their primordial yin is transferred to the man, it won’t cause much negative impact. With Young Brother’s current cultivation realm, subduing two Moon Slaves of the same level is no problem."

"Exactly. If our Commerce Guild’s Moon Slaves had issues, there wouldn’t be so many people coming to purchase and place orders," Halika said, nodding beside him.

"You even deal in human trafficking?" Yang Kai was shocked, never imagining that a behemoth like the Hengluo Commerce Guild could be so dark.

"It’s all consensual. Those Moon Slaves come from ordinary people of poor families. Without our Commerce Guild, they’d only live a few decades and die of old age. We provide them with cultivation resources and environments, letting them gain outstanding abilities… Moreover, coupling with a man brings them benefits as well. They can continue cultivating and improve their strength. If they win their master’s favor, wealth and honor are just around the corner. Many Moon Slaves who walked out from our Commerce Guild live quite well," Lin Mufeng explained. He seemed to see that Yang Kai was somewhat repulsed by such matters.

The middle-aged woman stood to the side with a blushing face and said nothing, but she was clearly very well-versed in the matter of Moon Slaves.

"Forget about Moon Slaves…" Yang Kai pondered for a moment, waved his hand, and said with a bitter face, "I’m afraid Lady Xue will fly into a rage when she wakes!"

He had to admit, hearing them recite the various benefits of Moon Slaves—especially that they could let one advance swiftly—did move him a little. Right now he was impatient to raise his cultivation realm as quickly as possible.

Tempted as he was, Yang Kai still refused.

He had some principles, and no matter how Halika and the others extolled the wonders of Moon Slaves, Yang Kai always felt that harvesting yin to replenish yang carried problems and would harm future cultivation.

"Since that’s the case, we won’t force it," Halika said, looking at Yang Kai with some approval. He hadn’t expected such a young man to refuse such a great temptation.

Moon Slaves were not only for improving strength. Each of them had been taught many ways of serving men; each was boundlessly charming and adept in countless tricks, long the subject of young men’s bragging across the Star Domain.

To travel with one or two Moon Slaves at one’s side was also a great show of face.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild cultivated a large number of Moon Slaves every year, but orders were already backlogged for years. The Moon Slave trade alone brought enormous revenue to the entire Hengluo Commerce Guild. Their prices kept climbing, yet it still couldn’t dampen people’s enthusiasm for purchasing them.

Yang Kai’s refusal surprised the three and made them feel this youth was unusual. No wonder he could catch Lady Xue’s eye and be chosen as a guard at her side.

After chatting with Halika and the others for a while longer, Yang Kai had them deliver the gathered supplies to Zong Ao’s palace, then he took his leave.

Returning once more to Zong Ao’s palace, Yang Kai was brimming with drive; his whole body felt filled with inexhaustible strength, his spirits soaring.

"Tsk, tsk—Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid, Snow Pool Crystal Essence…" Zong Ao clicked his tongue as he looked at the two items in front of Yang Kai. "Halika and Lin Mufeng were really willing, to give you such treasures. It seems that little lass has quite a high status in the Hengluo Commerce Guild."

In the end, the old are indeed the shrewder — with just one glance, Zong Ao recognized the names and purposes of the two items.

He then looked at the seven-colored little flags, played with them for a while, and chuckled strangely. "Boy, with these things to assist you, this old man estimates you can break through to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm in a very short time. Truly worthy of the Hengluo Commerce Guild—cultivating someone really is easy for them."

"Elder Zong, in a few days Halika and the others will send over the materials for refining the Leaving Flame Pill. Please do us the favor of receiving them." As Yang Kai spoke, he took the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags back from Zong Ao’s hand.

"So long as it doesn’t disturb this old man’s alchemy." Zong Ao grunted, then, in a complete lack of image, squatted in front of Yang Kai and asked suspiciously, "There’s one thing this old man doesn’t understand. Boy, can you tell me?"

"Please speak, Senior Zong!"

"Aren’t you going to refine a Pill to save your woman? Why did you bring these things back?"

"What else—cultivation," Yang Kai grinned, baring his teeth.

Zong Ao was stunned. "Are you out of your mind? You have at most a year and a half. To refine a Leaving Flame Pill that bears a Pill Cloud in that time is already rushed, and you still have the mind to cultivate?"

"Even ordinary people sharpen the knife before slaughtering a pig. What’s wrong with me cultivating? Besides, we’re still short one ingredient for the Leaving Flame Pill. Halika says it will take four months to transfer it from another medicine star. Should I just sit and wait without cultivating?" Yang Kai curled his lips.

"That may be so… but even if your strength rises to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, then what?" Zong Ao couldn’t understand why Yang Kai wasn’t the least bit anxious.

"Maybe that little Stage is exactly what will let me successfully refine a Pill Cloud," Yang Kai said with a light smile.

Zong Ao gave him a look as if he were an idiot, then straightened up. "Do as you like. This old man will just wait to see the result. If there’s nothing important, don’t disturb me. I’m off to refine pills."

He spoke as he walked out, muttering incessantly about how damned hard pills are to refine and so on.

Yang Kai didn’t mind. He carefully put those few items away.

Back on the Floating Continent, he had racked his brains and only managed to refine a single Saint King-Grade Pill to lift the restriction Lü Guichen had planted on him at the time. It was then that Yang Kai realized that the reason his current alchemy couldn’t improve was entirely because it was constrained by his realm.

His cultivation was too low. If he wanted to refine higher-grade Pills, he would first have to improve his own strength.

The four months Halika needed to transfer the Dragon Turtle Spirit Fruit gave Yang Kai an excellent buffer period. The Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid, Snow Pool Crystal Essence, and Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags were what he would rely on to raise his realm.

In four months, Yang Kai was extremely confident he could elevate his realm to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm. When the time came, refining the Leaving Flame Pill would become much easier.
