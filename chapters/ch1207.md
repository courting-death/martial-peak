## Chapter 1207 — Waiting by the Stump for a Rabbit

Yang Kai was willing to tarry here partly because the place was a rare find he did not want to miss, and partly because a quiet sense of danger gnawed at the back of his mind.

With his current strength he could handle Saint King Realm opponents without issue, but he was underpowered against those of the Origin Returning Realm; even that cold, indifferent man he had met in the Stalactite Cave was not someone Yang Kai could say with certainty he could defeat.

On the Dark Star, adrift in the Star Domain, Yang Kai had no backing — everything depended on himself.

Qian Tong treated him well, but that was only out of deference to the supposed master behind Yang Kai — the famed master of artifact forging; Qian Tong extended him courtesy and opened doors because of that reputation. If Qian Tong knew that the so‑called master did not in fact exist, Yang Kai could not be sure the man wouldn't change his face immediately.

Therefore Yang Kai had to make himself as strong as possible, so that when dealing with others he would not be forced onto the defensive, dragged about by other people's whims.

He was not alone in this world — there were still many ties weighing on his heart.

At the far end of the gorge a red light flashed, and the moment Yang Kai, who was tempering his Space Blade, sensed it and looked up, he was dumbstruck.

Another Flowing Flame Fireblaze!

It was exactly the same as what he had seen three days before — the Flowing Flame Fireblaze shot out from the mouth of the gorge at incredible speed, and the instant Yang Kai noticed it, it plunged into that strange pocket of space.

The perverse speed instantly slowed; the Flowing Flame Fireblaze drifted across that ten‑odd zhang of space at an uncanny pace.

Having learned from his experience days earlier, Yang Kai moved at once, straining his body while calculating where the Fireblaze would pass.

This time his luck seemed poor. The Fireblaze now would skim by him at a distance of only three chi, and Yang Kai had to reach that spot before it passed if he wanted any hope of seizing it.

Although Yang Kai had by now grown familiar with the viscous, congealed nature of this strange space and had become adept at wielding space power, moving here was still an ordeal.

By the time he at last neared the predicted spot, the Flowing Flame Fireblaze had already passed by once more.

Yang Kai frowned and stared at the treasure that had slipped past him for the third time, his face thoughtful.

According to what Wei Guchang had said before, Flowing Flame Fireblazes were supremely precious, but even in the Flowing Flame Sandland they were exceedingly rare; many who entered there never had the chance to encounter one.

That was indeed true. When Yang Kai had walked through the Heat‑Flame Zone on the First Layer, he had seen one only by chance; if his Divine Sense had not been sharp enough, the Fireblaze would have flown past without him even noticing.

Yet Wei Guchang's remarks applied only to the First Layer!

Yang Kai was now in the Third Layer's Heat‑Flame Zone. Would there be more Flowing Flame Fireblazes here? Were the two he had seen the same one? Was its flight path fixed?

If it were the same one, then its route was very likely fixed — otherwise how could Yang Kai have seen it again three days later?

If not the same one, then perhaps this gorge had some peculiarity that attracted these Flowing Flame Fireblazes, drawing them through it.

All manner of questions churned through Yang Kai's mind, and his expression shifted; for a time he set aside further practice of his spatial technique.

Soon he shook his head; whether the two Fireblazes he'd seen were the same or whether this gorge was a thoroughfare for them, he could confirm in a few days by waiting and watching.

He resumed tempering his spatial power, while deliberately keeping an eye on the movements at the gorge's mouth to see which of his theories would prove correct.

Time slipped by, and three days later, because the Fireblazes were on his mind, Yang Kai cast his gaze to the gorge's end early, waving his Space Blade and watching that place for movement.

To his surprise, after half a day's watch there was still no sign at the gorge's mouth — no trace of any Flowing Flame Fireblaze.

He felt some vexation.

However, this allowed him to determine that the two Fireblazes he had seen earlier were not the same; if they were identical, their appearances would have been more regular and one should have come by already.

Since there was no regularity, they could not be the same one.

On the fourth day, Yang Kai suddenly sensed something and looked toward the gorge's mouth; the sight before him both thrilled and surprised him.

He felt exhilarated because one of his guesses had been proven correct: this gorge was indeed a thoroughfare for the Flowing Flame Fireblazes — for now red light had already appeared at the gorge's mouth.

He was surprised because the red light was not a single beam but two, one behind the other, arriving almost simultaneously at the strange pocket of space before dropping speed and slowly drifting this way.

Yang Kai sprang into action. The two previous failures had given him ample experience; he was certain he would not fail this time.

What made him hesitate was that this time two Flowing Flame Fireblazes had arrived at once, their spacing a little over one zhang, making it impossible to catch both simultaneously.

After a moment's hesitation, Yang Kai shifted his body toward the Fireblaze nearer him along its flight path, and a jade bottle appeared in his hand.

Wei Guchang had described the Fireblaze's strangeness and usefulness but had never taught Yang Kai how to collect one; perhaps he himself did not know.

Yang Kai could only try the jade bottle first and, if it failed, think of another method.

After so many days of familiarizing and tempering, he moved much quicker than before; before the Fireblaze drifted past, Yang Kai had already intercepted its path.

Fixing his gaze on the Flowing Flame Fireblaze, Saint Yuan surging silently within him, he pushed his palm forward as it drew near.

The Fireblaze, already slowed, was struck by that blow and became even more sluggish.

Elated, Yang Kai quickly raised the prepared jade bottle and aimed its mouth at the Fireblaze, inviting it to fall into the trap.

The whole process went smoothly — the Flowing Flame Fireblaze plunged into the bottle, but the vessel was incinerated to ash in the blink of an eye by the searing flame.

Yang Kai's brow knitted; he knew he had been naive. Without hesitation he grabbed at the Fireblaze, clasping it in his palm; before its inner flame could explode, his Demonic Flame had already layered over it, wrapping the Fireblaze round and round.

He clearly felt the Fireblaze's heat battling his Demonic Flame; neither could overcome the other, and the Fireblaze writhed inside, trying to break through the Demonic Flame's confinement.

Yang Kai gave it no chance. Seeing that the method worked, he poured forth more Saint Yuan, turning it into fiercer Demonic Flame and binding the Fireblaze fast.

In no time the Fireblaze, shrouded by Demonic Flame, quieted and ceased struggling.

Staring at the fist‑sized black ball of fire in his palm, burning fiercely, Yang Kai grinned.

He had finally secured a Flowing Flame Fireblaze — not an easy gain — though the other one had slipped away while he dealt with its companion.

Yang Kai felt no regret; now that he knew this gorge was a thoroughfare for the Flowing Flame Fireblazes, he could simply sit and wait here, and he should reap more.

The black fireball formed by the Demonic Flame could not be placed into his Spatial Ring; he could only toss it into the Black Book Space. Once he returned, he could unravel the Demonic Flame and make good use of the Fireblaze's wondrous properties.

Buoyed by his first harvest, Yang Kai felt a lightness of spirit; tempering the Space Blade and comprehending the mysteries of space grew easier, his control of spatial power ever more skillful, and the strange pocket of space seemed to restrain him less and less.

……

A month later, by the same method Yang Kai obtained another Flowing Flame Fireblaze; his expression was neither gleeful nor sorrowful as he tossed it casually into his Spatial Ring.

After about one and a half months of cultivation here, he had acquired nine Flowing Flame Fireblazes in total.

That was a considerable number — likely no one had ever collected so many — yet a faint regret flickered across Yang Kai's brow.

As his understanding of space deepened, this strange pocket aided his cultivation less and less, and because he had repeatedly wielded the Space Blade and torn at the space, he seemed to have damaged its heavy, congealed nature, making this rare training ground more normal.

Without the space's potent restraint, the Fireblazes that entered now did not slow as drastically as before; had Yang Kai not been so experienced, the last Fireblaze might have flown right past him.

Yang Kai estimated he could refine his skills here for at most another ten days before the place ceased to be effective.

That being so, he decided to make full use of it until the last moment before departing.

Resolute, Yang Kai ceased wasting time, throwing the collected Flowing Flame Fireblazes into the Black Book Space and burying himself in arduous cultivation.

He waited for several days and no more Flowing Flame Fireblazes appeared; it seemed his indiscriminate hunting had driven those that passed this place to extinction.

One day Yang Kai finally sensed the presence of a Flowing Flame Fireblaze again and, not daring to slacken, sprang into action.

When he swiftly took up the perfect position the Fireblaze crashed into the strange space; he, practiced in the maneuver, stretched out his palm, captured it in his hand, and then stirred Saint Yuan into Demonic Flame to layer it about.

Before long a black fireball formed in his hand.

But before Yang Kai could toss it into the Black Book Space, a low exclamation came from behind, followed by the rustle of robes and the sound of several martial artists rapidly approaching.

Yang Kai frowned and promptly threw the black fireball into the Black Book Space, turning to look at the newcomers.

At the sight, a flash of disgust crossed Yang Kai's brow — the newcomers were several warriors of the Battle Sky Alliance.
