## Chapter 2078 — Dao Origin Pill

The rings Mo Xiaoqi handed to Duan Yuanshan were packed with Qingxin Jade—countless in number!

This left Duan Yuanshan overjoyed.

"Miss, are these all from that mine?" Duan Yuanshan asked, his face thoughtful.

Mo Xiaoqi nodded. "I knocked out several Jiang Family warriors in the mine and took their Spatial Rings; they're all here."

Duan Yuanshan immediately stood and bowed deeply, saying, "Miss, by your great kindness, please accept this bow from Duan!"

Mo Xiaoqi hurriedly waved her hand, a little embarrassed. "Lord Duan, this is really nothing."

Duan Yuanshan slowly shook his head and said in a low voice, "In any case, your favor this time will be recorded by Fenglin City; if we survive this calamity, you shall be a guest of honor."

Qingxin Jade benefited every martial artist, so it carried considerable value; such a quantity was itself an astounding fortune.

If it had been ordinary cultivators, even knowing Fenglin City was in peril, they would hardly have handed over their Qingxin Jade—but Mo Xiaoqi produced them without so much as a frown.

This filled Duan Yuanshan with deep gratitude.

"Consider these Qingxin Jade purchased by the Fenglin City Lord's Mansion," Duan Yuanshan said. "Later we will convert them into the equivalent Source Crystals and repay you."

"It really doesn't matter," Mo Xiaoqi said, truly at a loss for words.

Yang Kai's expression flickered and he said, "Lord Duan, I also have some Qingxin Jade here; if it's not enough, just tell me."

Duan Yuanshan brightened at the words and laughed heartily. "With Brother Yang and Miss lending aid, how could Fenglin City not be secured? Brother Yang is so generous—I thank you in advance. If it proves insufficient, I will come to you. Now I must distribute this Qingxin Jade; would Brother Yang accompany me to the city walls... to repel the enemy together?"

Yang Kai did not answer immediately; instead he swept his gaze over the others and said, "I can go, but I must first get them settled down."

That was only natural. Duan Yuanshan rejoiced—having a Dao Origin Realm expert lend aid would be of tremendous benefit to all of Fenglin City, and he thanked Yang Kai for his sense of duty and righteousness.

With that, he flashed in a blur, swiftly boarded a tower-ship, and shot straight toward the city walls.

After Duan Yuanshan departed, Yang Kai looked to Mo Xiaoqi and said, "Xiaoqi, my dwelling has been reclaimed by the city lord's mansion; have them settle into your dwelling."

"No problem," Mo Xiaoqi replied promptly.

Yang Kai nodded and, following Mo Xiaoqi's directions, piloted the tower-ship toward her dwelling.

Soon the group arrived at Mo Xiaoqi's dwelling.

Under Yang Kai's arrangements, a party from the Zhang Family and some workers from the Spiritual Pill Shop, including two pillmasters, were brought into the dwelling.

"Matriarch, rest here for now. If Fenglin City changes again, I'll come for you in advance and take you away." After saying that, Yang Kai looked at Zhang Ruoxi and added, "Ruoxi, look after your Zhang family."

"Yes! Sir, please be careful!" Zhang Ruoxi watched Yang Kai with a face full of worry.

"Xiaoqi, do you have a secret chamber here?" Yang Kai asked.

"There is one, follow me," Mo Xiaoqi said, though she did not know what Yang Kai intended and hurried to lead the way.

"Brother Kang, come over too!" Yang Kai called to Kang Siran.

Kang Siran, though puzzled, did not ask and followed closely.

The dwelling Mo Xiaoqi rented in Fenglin City was top-tier—rich in Spiritual Qi and large in size; it could not be compared with Yang Kai's previous dwelling.

There were five or six secret chambers within the dwelling suitable for seclusion.

Upon reaching one of the secret chambers, Yang Kai gave Mo Xiaoqi a look; she understood and stepped back.

Kang Siran was baffled. "Yang, why did you bring me to this secret chamber? At a time like this, shouldn't we be outside united with the other fighters to resist the Demonic Qi?"

"Brother Kang, take a look at this," Yang Kai said as he tossed out a jade bottle.

Kang Siran took it with suspicion, opened the lid, inverted the bottle, and poured out a Spiritual Pill.

In the next moment Kang's body jolted and his eyes shone as he stared at the pill in his hand, disbelief written all over his face; after a long moment he seemed certain and cried out, "Dao Origin Pill?"

As the Shopkeeper of the Spiritual Pill Shop, he had handled countless miraculous pills, and so had considerable knowledge of pills; although he had never seen a Dao Origin Pill in person, his experience told him what it should look and smell like.

The pill in his hand matched the rumored Dao Origin Pill exactly.

The only difference was that this Dao Origin Pill bore vein-like patterns—like the meridians of a human body—a beautiful design as if crafted by heaven and earth, decorating the pill's surface.

"A Dao Origin Pill with Pill Patterns?" Kang Siran's voice sharpened, his hands trembling uncontrollably.

"I obtained this inside Primordial Cauldron Mountain. As you suspected, that was indeed Gongsun Mu's dwelling; he left behind Dao Origin Pills he had refined, but sadly the years have passed... only this one was preserved; the others had become useless," Yang Kai explained with some regret.

That, of course, was nonsense.

This Dao Origin Pill with Pill Patterns had been personally refined by him before his breakthrough to the Dao Origin Realm; when it was refined successfully he had no time to inspect the results and immediately threw himself into the process of ascending.

After he later succeeded in ascending and waited near Primordial Cauldron Mountain for Liu Yan, he finally had the leisure to examine it.

At that time he had refined six pills at once—five were ordinary Dao Origin Pills, and only this one had developed Pill Patterns.

Fortunately that was the case; otherwise he would have had no way to explain the pill's origin.

After all, only a Spiritual Pill that developed Pill Patterns could remain intact for a long time and retain its efficacy.

Now, telling Kang that this Dao Origin Pill had come from Primordial Cauldron Mountain and been refined by Gongsun Mu was a plausible explanation.

"Brother Yang, this..." Kang Siran, though overwhelmed with excitement, showed no trace of greed and instead looked up at Yang Kai, then bit his lip and said, "This item is far too precious; I cannot accept it!"

Yang Kai chuckled. "Brother Kang, you are being too polite. If not for you I would not have gone to Primordial Cauldron Mountain; didn't we agree that if there were Dao Origin Pills they would be yours while other alchemical matters would be mine? I obtained more than one Dao Origin Pill in Primordial Cauldron Mountain and also some things useful to me; my breakthrough owes much to those opportunities."

Yang Kai's words were not empty—had he not taken the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup beneath Primordial Cauldron Mountain, his Origin Qi would not have transformed so rapidly; had his Origin Qi not fully transformed, he could not have broken through to the Dao Origin Realm.

"Be that as it may, I did not help at all. If that Dao Origin Pill were auctioned off, it would be worth at least tens of millions of Source Crystals, perhaps more; I would be ashamed to accept such a thing!" Kang Siran kept shaking his head, then returned the Dao Origin Pill to the jade bottle and shoved it back to Yang Kai.

Although his eyes were full of reluctance, his movements were decisive and his words sounded resolute; it was clear he truly felt that way, not pretending.

At the last auction, the centerpiece Dao Origin Fruit had sold for over ten million Source Crystals; although a Dao Origin Realm practitioner could refine a batch of Dao Origin Pills—sometimes yielding several finished pills—there was great risk: if refinement failed, everything could be lost.

But what Yang Kai held was a finished Dao Origin Pill, and one with Pill Patterns at that—its effects were extraordinary.

In value, it was undoubtedly worth several times a Dao Origin Fruit.

In other words, any martial artist at the peak of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm who obtained this pill would have at least a seventy-percent chance of ascending to the Dao Origin Realm.

"Brother Kang, do you really not want it?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Kang Siran resolutely shook his head, though his eyes kept glancing toward Yang Kai's hand; finally he hardened himself, turned his head away, preferring not to look.

"If that's so..." Yang Kai said calmly, then opened the jade bottle and tossed the Dao Origin Pill in his hand, playing with it.

"What are you doing?" Kang Siran asked immediately, alarmed.

"Might as well eat it like a roasted bean—this pill smells divine; it must taste good," Yang Kai said, and truly tossed the pill; it flew in an arc toward his open mouth.

"Stop!" Kang Siran cried in horror, snatching it back before it entered Yang Kai's gaping mouth. He was furious. "Damn it, truly vile—Brother Yang, you're destroying a treasure fit for heaven and earth!"

"You didn't want it anyway," Yang Kai shrugged, looking indifferent.

Kang Siran sighed. "Very well. Since Brother Yang treats me so sincerely, if I still fuss it would be petty. I accept this Dao Origin Pill; I will remember your favor and repay it someday. Brother Yang, please accept my bow!"

With that he smoothed his robe, his expression solemn, and bowed deeply to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave a light laugh and, without dodging, nodded. "That's more like it."

He suddenly took on a serious tone. "Brother Kang, stay here and refine the pill to absorb its medicinal efficacy. If my estimate is correct, in seven or eight days Fenglin City should be out of serious danger; that time should be enough for you to ascend. I'll wait outside for your good news!"

"If I do not succeed, I will give my life! I will not let Brother Yang down!" Kang Siran said in a low voice.
