## Chapter 1536 — Don't Be Nervous

“Since we happened to run into the two of you here, it saves this old man a trip — please accept these Saint Crystal, and do not refuse!” the old man said as he cast a glance at the green-clothed girl.

The green-clothed girl clutched her Spatial Ring and shook her head repeatedly, clearly unwilling to hand over the spoils of this expedition — they had fought tooth and nail for those gains.

“Hand them over!” the old man barked.

Under his stern stare, the green-clothed girl at last, unwillingly and begrudgingly, took out a bundle from her Spatial Ring and passed it to the old man.

The old man forced a smile and said humbly, “All the Saint Crystal we obtained are here; please, Lords, accept them!”

Saying that, he tossed the bundle across.

The burly man opposite reached out and caught it, weighing it in his hand for a moment before his eyes lit up. “Not a bad haul, old fellow.”

“Heh heh, this time luck was better,” the old man laughed awkwardly.

In the past they’d never had so much from a single expedition; this time they’d been trailing behind Yang Kai, so the take was indeed larger.

“Two Lords, we will take our leave!” the old man cupped his fist slightly, not intending to linger.

“Wait a moment — I didn’t say you could go. Who said you could leave?” the burly man threw the bundle back to his companion and growled.

“Pardon me, Lord, what further instructions do you have?” the old man clutched his chest and asked, alarmed.

“You were caught trading secretly this time, and I caught you red-handed! What about before? When I wasn’t looking, where did those Saint Crystal go?” the burly man asked with ill intent.

“It’s an injustice, Lord — in the past whenever we traded, every time we paid the stipulated Saint Crystal, never once missing a payment, I beg you, Lord, judge fairly!” the old man cried out in panic.

“Heh heh, judge fairly or not, I’ll make my own judgment. Today, either you hand over the Saint Crystal from past trades and I spare your lives, or you leave everything behind!” the burly man snorted coldly.

“Lord, you’re putting us in an impossible position,” the old man fretted, “we never did such a thing before. How could we possibly produce those Saint Crystal?”

“That’s right. Almost all the Saint Crystal were taken by you; where would we possibly have extras to give?” the green-clothed girl cried out.

“Little wench, you’ve got guts,” the burly man said darkly as he gave the girl a slanted look. Then his eyes brightened, and he began to ogle her lithe, full form with lascivious light in his gaze, chuckling lowly.

Sensing the change, the old man knew something was wrong and pulled the green-clothed girl behind him. He bowed and pleaded, “Lord, please show mercy and spare us.”

“Spare you…” the burly man stroked his chin and put on a pretended deliberation. After a moment he nodded, “Fine. I’m not unreasonable — I can be talked to. Since this is your first offense, I suppose I can let you off this once.”

The old man rejoiced and hurriedly said, “Thank you, Lord.”

“Don’t be hasty, I haven’t finished,” the burly man chuckled and pointed at the green-clothed girl behind the old man. “If there are no Saint Crystal, surrender someone instead. This little wench stays; the rest of you get out!”

At these words the green-clothed girl’s pretty face turned pale, and the old man looked panicked and rushed, “Lord, Fei'er is still young…”

“Young, huh? She doesn’t look it to me!” the burly man leered suggestively, then his expression shifted into a vicious sneer as he growled, “One last chance — the little wench stays, the rest of you get lost. If any of you dare make a fuss, I’ll kill you all.”

The old man and the others fell silent, anger churning yet unable to show it. They cast pleading looks around, hoping someone in the crowd would speak for justice or step forward to help.

But everyone averted their eyes from his gaze.

The old man felt utterly hopeless, never having imagined matters would come to this.

The green-clothed girl’s eyes also showed despair.

“What’s all the commotion? Let me see!”

A sudden voice rang out from the back of the crowd.

The crowd turned to look and saw a youth in sturdy attire striding over, a wine jar in his hand, a peculiar smile on his face.

His gaze was brazen and arrogant, his manner rakish and unconcerned; he strode forward while guzzling strong wine and chuckled, “So I hear someone here is about to kill someone.”

“Eldest Brother Yang!” the green-clothed girl cried, as if a drowning person had grasped a life-preserver, a strange light springing to her beautiful eyes.

The old man and the others also looked oddly at him.

The crowd parted on its own as Yang Kai walked straight up to the old man and his group. His Divine Sense swept over them, and he gave a slight nod.

The old man’s injuries weren’t too severe—otherwise, with his cultivation at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, facing that burly man, he would have been killed in a single move.

After all, the other party was a warrior of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

“Young Brother…” the old man opened his mouth and, looking grateful, said to Yang Kai, but still added, “You need not wade into this.”

He sighed lightly, a look of guilt on his face.

He knew Yang Kai must have some camaraderie with them from having traveled together earlier and had come out to lend assistance; he also knew Yang Kai’s profound strength.

But this was Bibo City; Yang Kai alone would be hard-pressed to face four assailants. If he really intervened, he might not be able to ensure his own safety.

“Elder, there’s no need to worry about me,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

Hearing that, the old man could only force a bitter smile and said no more.

“Kid, who are you?” the burly man’s face darkened as his gaze turned icily to Yang Kai.

“Here to watch the show,” Yang Kai grinned at him.

“You’re courting death!” the burly man roared. Ever since Bibo City had become entangled, in subtle ways, with the Lingxiao Sect, no one had dared act recklessly here. As someone belonging to the city lord’s household, he was respected wherever he went, and now a reckless youth dared to taunt him — of course he was furious.

With a fierce shout he charged at Yang Kai and produced a Secret Treasure like an iron hammer. Radiant lights flickered over it as it drove viciously toward Yang Kai.

A gasp rose from the onlookers; the old man’s heart tightened and the green-clothed girl shrieked.

For the next moment that Secret Treasure might have smashed Yang Kai’s head to pulp.

Yang Kai threw a punch to meet the iron hammer.

Clang!

A thunderous sound erupted; Yang Kai remained unscathed, while the iron-hammer Secret Treasure was struck by a tremendous force and flung away, vanishing in an instant.

Yang Kai raised the wine jar in his hand and slammed it hard against the burly man’s head.

With a crisp crash the jar shattered, drenching the man head to toe in strong wine. Before he could recover from the shock, a heavy foot came flying and struck him in the face.

A horrible scream issued as the burly man flew back like a kite, blood streaming from his face — a ghastly sight. The kick had smashed his nose flat, breaking the bridge; many teeth were knocked loose.

The whole scene shocked the crowd!

Everyone stared at Yang Kai with strange looks, as if looking at a monster.

They were not only shocked by Yang Kai’s strength, but by the fact he had dared to strike a member of the city lord’s household within Bibo City!

The burly man howled in agony and fury, “You dare hit me!”

“Hit you? So what if I hit you?” Yang Kai sneered, mocking him with his own words. “Who told you to be so ungrateful? I didn’t take your life — I showed mercy. You should be grateful, yet you dare to scold me. Believe it or not, I’ll kill you right now!”

Those words sounded familiar, like the burly man’s earlier taunts toward the girl.

The burly man went stunned.

His companion’ expression shifted; he looked at Yang Kai with terror.

To be able to fell the burly man in an instant — such strength was far beyond what he could hope to contend with. Even if he wished to regain face for the burly man, he was utterly powerless. Realizing this, he turned to flee, intending to report the matter to the City Lord’s Mansion and call for reinforcements.

“I didn’t tell you to run — can you get away?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and flicked out a strand of Golden Blood Threads toward them.

Gold light flashed and vanished; the fleeing man let out a howl and collapsed to the ground the next moment.

There were no wounds, but his life force rapidly ebbed away.

He was dead!

Eyes popped across the courtyard; if Yang Kai’s striking of the city lord’s men had already shaken them, this scene tore their hearts to pieces!

Someone from the city lord’s household had been killed!

How could this be tolerated?

In recent years no one had dared oppose the city lord’s household; anyone who had harbored such thoughts had been wiped out. Yet today a youth, in broad daylight and before everyone, had slain one of their warriors.

One could imagine the city lord’s household would unleash a storm of reprisals.

Even if he were supremely talented, there would be no escape from Bibo City.

He was surely doomed!

A chorus of gasps rang out as the crowd’s gaze toward Yang Kai shifted to dread; they instinctively drew away lest they be mistaken for allies and be implicated.

“Young Brother, you…” the old man could not believe his eyes.

As for Fei'er and the other young ones, they were elated, worshipful looks fixed on Yang Kai as if he were already an idol.

Youths are always impassioned.

“Just killed a piece of trash, no need to be so tense, old sir.” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, his expression calm and unruffled.

“Young Brother, you should leave quickly. This place is no place to linger. While the news hasn’t spread yet you may still have a sliver of chance — if you delay it will be too late,” the old man urged Yang Kai anxiously.

“Leave? Why should I leave?” Yang Kai shook his head.

The old man stared at Yang Kai in stupefaction: “You won’t leave? Do you mean to stay?”

“Yes.”

The old man panicked like an ant on a hot pan. “Do you know who you just killed? Do you understand how big a calamity you’ve caused? You actually want to stay — are you mad?”

“Heh.” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Old sir, don’t be so anxious. Since I chose to stay, naturally I’m not afraid of them. If they truly have what it takes to kill me—let them try.”
