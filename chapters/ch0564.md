## Chapter 564 — The Evil Kings Make Their Move

Hearing that Yang Kai and the warriors from his residence had all stayed behind, Yang Wei's expression shifted slightly, and he said thoughtfully, “Ninth Brother is not so easily killed. Since he chose to stay behind, he must have a plan... I think we should move with him instead of recklessly returning to Zhongdu.”

Ye Xinrou sneered with disdain. Though she said nothing, it was clear she thought Yang Wei was too indecisive and cowardly.

Kang Zhan chuckled as well. “Eldest Young Master, seven of the Eight Great Families’ top experts are already intercepting those few, creating a chance for our retreat. Our priority should be to hurry back to Zhongdu.”

Yang Wei shook his head. “If they can defeat those few, then staying behind won’t be dangerous. But if they lose, even if we retreat... it’ll hardly matter.”

At his words, Ye Xinrou, Kang Zhan, and Gao Rangfeng all changed expression dramatically.

Yang Wei’s words struck on a truth they dared not think about, or rather, had been trying hard to avoid considering. Now that Yang Wei spoke the situation aloud, an uneasy terror sprinkled into their hearts.

“Impossible...” Kang Zhan forced a smile. “We have seven experts here.”

“Yes,” Gao Rangfeng nodded as well. “Seven top experts, how could they be no match for three enemies? Even if... even if they really are inferior, they should at least delay them until we reach Zhongdu.”

Just then, several Blood Servants belonging to Yang Wei and Yang Zhao suddenly shouted fiercely, “Young masters, be careful!”

They immediately darted to the two men’s sides, forming a defensive stance to protect them.

The entire group suddenly halted. All the Divine Roaming Realm experts showed deep apprehension as they stared ahead.

In the distance hovered two shadowy figures, silently suspended in midair, looking down on the crowd from high above.

Their faces were obscured, one shrouded in green qi, the other enveloped in black qi. Only their chilling eyes shone with a terrifying radiance that made it impossible to look directly at them.

“Heh heh heh heh...” The green-qi-wrapped figure gave a sinister chuckle, apparently looking at Yang Wei with approval. “You people, it’s rare to find some who can see the situation clearly. So you’re not all fools. Not bad—the seven from your Eight Great Families cannot stop the three experts from my Sacred Land. Before long, they’ll all be dead there."

“You will die too!” The black-qi-wrapped individual spoke in a hoarse voice like a summons from the depths of hell, sending chills down everyone’s spines.

“Such outrageous arrogance!” Ye Xinrou shouted harshly. “Who exactly are you?”

A burst of laughter followed. The green-qi figure turned to his companion and said, “Ghost King, there are still people who don’t recognize us? Is this the rising generation of the Eight Great Families? They can’t even identify us. Looks like the Eight Great Families have really fallen.”

“Hmph, Eight Great Families? That’s just a self-styled title. What are they truly?” The one called Ghost King sneered leisurely. “Poison King, between us, we each have our own killing methods. How about a contest?”

“A contest?”

“There are plenty of people here. Let’s see who kills the most.”

“Not bad. That proposal suits me well.”

The seven or eight hundred people stood dumbfounded, staring blankly at the two figures before them.

After a long moment, Ye Xinrou suddenly shouted, “Yinming Ghost King and Destruction Poison King?”

Their earlier exchange had revealed their identities. If Ye Xinrou didn’t know them by now, she would truly be an imbecile.

These two hail from Cangyun Evil Land and are two of the Six Great Evil Kings—fiendish demons feared throughout the land.

It is said the Six Great Evil Kings are merciless killers, savage and vicious beyond measure. Among them, the Yinming Ghost King and Destruction Poison King are the deadliest.

Their cultivation arts suit large-scale slaughter better than anything else.

Faced with such horrifying figures, every person present felt a bone-deep chill and trembled involuntarily.

“Scatter immediately!” One of the four Blood Servants suddenly roared. Against most enemies, gathering together boosts power, allowing many to fight few and seize a chance to survive.

But facing the Ghost King and Poison King, numbers made no difference. Gathering only made the crowd easier prey for their deadly arts.

Although the roar echoed, no one reacted. Even the top warriors from the Seven Great Families’ allied forces froze in place.

The fierce courage shown last night against Yang Kai was nowhere to be found. Now, facing two Evil Kings, they were as frozen as statues—this brief hesitation alone meant they missed their best chance at defense.

“Where to scatter?” the Ghost King chuckled grimly. Suddenly terrifying human faces appeared on his body, writhing and struggling like ghosts trying to break free from the underworld’s chains, emitting agonizing wails that made hearts quail and souls waver.

These screaming ghost faces swiftly surged forward, their shapes uncanny and ethereal as they tore into the crowd, wreaking havoc.

Countless faces of wailing ghosts swirled before the eyes like a hellish, frenzied dance.

Wherever those ghost faces passed, a biting cold wind followed, chilling hands and feet.

The Ghost King seemed exhilarated, laughing hoarsely, intensifying the sense of helplessness.

Some quick-witted warriors tried attacking the ghost faces with Martial Skills, but their attacks passed right through the specters without harm.

Instead, anyone struck by these ghost faces instantly lost the light in their eyes and turned into horrifying, feral figures who mercilessly attacked their companions.

“Use soul techniques! Attack them with soul techniques!” A strong warrior quickly realized and shouted, recalling rumors he’d heard.

The ghost faces released from the Ghost King’s body were intangible; ordinary weapon and martial skills could not harm them.

Only soul techniques could halt their advance.

Yet Divine Roaming Realm experts composed only about one-third of the crowd. Those capable of releasing soul techniques varied in strength.

The strongest could repel the ghost faces momentarily, but many weaker ones could not withstand the assault.

Within moments, over a hundred people were afflicted.

Those possessed lost all control of their will. Once the ghost faces entered their bodies, their disposition changed drastically—they raved like madmen, ruthlessly attacking those nearby.

Screams rang out and blood splattered. In an instant, the area became a Shura’s Purgatory.

“Heh heh heh heh...” The Ghost King roared with madness, not even moving his hands yet wreaking such havoc. This was but a glimpse of his formidable power.

Meanwhile, from the Poison King’s body spread a bright green aura, expanding at an incredible rate.

Soon, a vast area was shrouded in poisonous green mist.

Those caught in the toxic fog screamed and collapsed, turning into pools of blood with no bones left.

“Beware the poison!” someone cried out, but it was already too late. The Poison King’s strike had claimed dozens of lives—including some Divine Roaming Realm warriors.

Very few within the poison cloud survived—only those around the seventh or eighth Divine Roaming Realm layers managed to escape turning into blood pools.

Even among them, their faces turned greenish, their True Yuan fluctuating as they stubbornly resisted the poison, unable to break free to counterattack.

The puppeteered warriors controlled by ghost faces attacked these elite warriors, easily pulverizing them with a casual gesture.

The two Evil Kings fought side by side, disregarding seven or eight hundred warriors as insignificant, creating a massacre unmatched in cruelty.

Moreover, it seemed they had still not shown their full strength—it was all mere casual attacks.

“Blood Fury Technique!” The four Blood Servants of the Yang Family simultaneously unleashed this forbidden art, guarding Yang Wei and Yang Zhao. They charged aggressively through the crowd, striving to find a sliver of salvation.

Ye Xinrou sat dumbfounded on her Treading Cloud Steed, her delicate face filled with bewilderment and terror, eyes brimming with shock.

She had never imagined that the Evil Kings of Cangyun Evil Land possessed such astonishing methods.

Kang Zhan and Gao Rangfeng were likewise dumbstruck.

Both scions of the Eight Great Families and inheritors of their respective clans, they had lived easy, secure lives in Zhongdu with promising futures. Although this Succession War had been fraught with dangers, none of those challenges had ever made them feel as powerless as this.

Yang Kai at least tempered his approach with reason, but these two Evil Kings made all resistance feel utterly futile.

“Miss!” “Young Master!” Strong warriors from the Ye, Kang, and Gao families rushed over, pulling them off their mounts and emulating the Blood Servants to seek an escape route.

Their panic quickly attracted the attention of Yinming Ghost King and Destruction Poison King.

“Poison King, those young ones seem different from the others,” the Ghost King said ominously with a sinister smile.

“Likely direct heirs of the Eight Great Families,” the Poison King nodded softly, his gaze scanning them before suddenly waving his hand.

Countless invisible energy waves shot out, accurately striking every guard protecting the Eight Great Families’ heirs within the bloodied inferno.

The four Blood Servants of the Yang Family let out muffled groans, faces turning pale but steadfastly continuing to protect Yang Wei and Yang Zhao.

In contrast, the Ye, Kang, and Gao family members instantly turned into pools of blood and fell lifeless.

“Come here!” The Poison King beckoned again, and Ye Xinrou and the others suddenly felt an invisible force bind them, involuntarily flying to the Poison King's side.

The three trembled violently, shivering like quails in midwinter, utterly lost and terrified as they stared at the Poison King and Ghost King standing before them.

“Are you the direct heirs of the Eight Great Families?” the Poison King inquired.

The three were stunned into silence, trembling all over, none daring to answer.
