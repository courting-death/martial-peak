## Chapter 565 — Yang Kai Saves Us

The Poison King snorted coldly, stretching out a hand. His long fingernails, shimmering with a green eerie light, lightly scratched across Ye Xinrou’s cheek.

That tender, fair face immediately bore a blood-red scratch, warm fresh blood flowing down, gathering on Ye Xinrou’s delicate chin, dripping drop by drop.

Ye Xinrou’s teeth clenched fiercely, clattering together. Her pretty face turned pale as snow, her beautiful eyes widening, tears uncontrollably streaming down.

She sensed an overwhelming aura of death rushing towards her—more intense than ever before.

Under this aura, she truly felt as if she had already died.

“Answer my question, or you shall become the Ghost King’s favorite meal. The Ghost King is most fond of devouring delicate young girls like you.”

Ye Xinrou gave a horror-stricken glance at the Yinming Ghost King standing nearby. Suddenly, a rumor surfaced in her mind—one that said the Yinming Ghost King was ruthlessly inhuman, known for eating people alive.

In her extreme terror, she inexplicably summoned a shred of courage and hurriedly replied, “It’s not true!”

At this critical moment, she found she could still think. The Cangyun Evil Land and the Eight Great Families were bitter enemies, hating each other irreconcilably. If these two Evil Kings learned their true identities, who knew what torments awaited them?

It was precisely with that consideration that Ye Xinrou firmly denied the accusation.

“Not true?” The Poison King smiled darkly and nodded faintly. “If that’s the case, then there’s no need to keep you alive.”

Gao Rangfeng and Kang Zhan were shocked by his words.

The next moment, it was as if something inside Gao Rangfeng was swelling outward. His body suddenly inflated, and without a sound, he exploded into a cloud of blood mist.

So close by, Kang Zhan and Ye Xinrou were drenched from head to toe in the blood splattered from Gao Rangfeng’s explosion, even their wide-open eyes soaked red with blood.

Everywhere in sight was blood red...

“We are!” Kang Zhan screamed as if his heart was being torn apart. “We are the direct heirs of the Eight Great Families! I am Kang Family’s! I am the Kang Family’s future heir!”

“Is that so?” The Poison King expressed the slightest impatience, staring coldly at Ye Xinrou.

Ye Xinrou nodded instinctively, staring blankly at the place where Gao Rangfeng had just stood, but now contained only a pool of blood.

That man was no longer among the living.

The future heir of the Gao Family, one of the Eight Great Families, had died right before her eyes.

“Poison King, since they truly are the direct heirs of the Eight Great Families, leave them be. Perhaps they might be useful to the Master’s plan to attack Zhongdu,” the Yinming Ghost King suddenly said.

The Poison King nodded lightly without objection but sneered coldly at Ye Xinrou, “Little girl, your false answer has cost a friend his life.”

Ye Xinrou’s eyes were lifeless, like a sky shrouded by dark clouds, revealing not a glimmer of light.

“And those two.” The Poison King looked up, staring at Yang Wei and Yang Zhao, who were guarded by four Blood Servants. “Those few around them must be members of the Yang Family Blood Servants Hall, so they are direct heirs of the Yang Family as well.”

His expression grew ominous as he spoke.

Though the Eight Great Families and the Cangyun Evil Land both bore grudges, the greatest hatred among the Six Great Evil Kings without doubt lay with the Yang Family.

Because the Yang Family was the leader of the Eight Great Families and their Blood Servants Hall’s experts had, during the last great purge of Cangyun Evil Land, slain many of its warriors, earning formidable renown that terrified many dark cultivators.

Now that members of the Blood Servants Hall and direct heirs of the Yang Family stood before them, the Poison King naturally refused to let them go.

“These two are mine.” The Yinming Ghost King said, his figure expanding into a streak of black light as he rushed forward.

His target was the four Blood Servants and Yang Wei and Yang Zhao.

“Two young masters, run!” The four Blood Servants sensed the proximity of the Yinming Ghost King and quickly hurled Yang Wei and Yang Zhao out of the crowd, then turned back to confront the Ghost King.

Even knowing they could not win, they remained resolute and unhesitating. They intended to use their own lives and blood to buy a last hope for Yang Wei and Yang Zhao.

“Clowns!” The Yinming Ghost King laughed sinisterly as his ghostly aura once again slowly radiated forth, dense as substance. Flying forward, he dismissed the four Blood Servants who had unleashed the Blood Fury Technique, casually slapping at them.

Cold winds blew relentlessly; wails like ghosts and wolves filled the air as a massive terrifying creature with a blue face and fangs suddenly appeared before the four.

This monster-like entity was purely formed from the ghostly energy within the Yinming Ghost King’s body. Though intangible, it possessed unrivaled combat power.

The four combined forces to block it.

Before they could strike back, the Yinming Ghost King had already swooped above Yang Wei and Yang Zhao, extending a large hand to grasp them.

Their faces ashen as death, Yang Wei and Yang Zhao were considered outstanding talents among the younger generation, already risen to the Divine Roaming Realm, yet before such a powerful foe, they were nothing.

They didn’t even think to resist, watching helplessly as those ghostly claws reached down.

At that moment, a strip of light suddenly burst forth from the void, intercepting the Yinming Ghost King between him and Yang Wei and Yang Zhao.

“Hmph?” The Ghost King frowned upon sensing the power contained within the strike, no longer daring to attack recklessly, swiftly withdrawing.

A brilliant light bloomed, brushing past the Ghost King’s body, striking empty space.

A figure flashed—Yang Kai had arrived beside Yang Wei and Yang Zhao. He grabbed one in each hand and tossed them to Tu Feng and the others who had just arrived.

Though Yang Wei and Yang Zhao had not been physically injured nor fought the Poison King or Ghost King, they were still badly affected by the toxic and ghostly auras. Their expressions were strained as Tu Feng took over and immediately broke through toward the direction of the mansion.

“More experts?” The Poison King laughed, unleashing his poison technique to encase Yang Kai and the others.

Ling Taixu’s expression tightened. Alongside Li Yuanchun, they simultaneously attacked, unleashing profound and powerful force to repel the toxic mist.

“Huh? Not bad,” the Poison King leisurely observed Ling Taixu and Li Yuanchun, apparently not expecting their formidable skills.

The Yinming Ghost King’s ghost eyes gleamed with green eerie light as he stared toward Tu Feng’s fleeing direction, but only snorted and did not pursue. Instead, he joined forces with the Poison King to engage Ling Taixu and Li Yuanchun fiercely.

Ling Taixu’s expression was calm. Despite his reluctance to confront such ruthless foes, when action was required, he acted without negligence.

Li Yuanchun, however, was filled with frustration and vexation.

He was like a patriarch overseas—among the overseas isles, only the Tai Yi Sect was a supreme force, with only three experts of Divine Roaming Realm or above.

Li Yuanchun’s status was evident; all the sects and clans on the overseas isles treated him with great respect.

This time, he led a team to War City to reclaim the sect’s ancestral treasure lost centuries ago. This showed how seriously the overseas powers regarded this matter.

Unexpectedly, upon arriving in War City, he immediately got caught up in this trouble.

He didn’t care about offending the Eight Great Families or the Cangyun Evil Land, but if he couldn’t reclaim the treasure, having to fight on someone else’s behalf first was not the result Li Yuanchun wanted.

Especially battling such formidable adversaries as the Destruction Poison King and Yinming Ghost King required effort without reward.

When he returned, no matter what, he intended to snatch those relics from the Yang Family brat and then lead his people to retreat swiftly! Li Yuanchun steeled this resolve amid the battle.

The Poison King and Ghost King were held back by Ling Taixu and Li Yuanchun, giving Yang Kai a moment to scan the surroundings. What he saw chilled him.

Though all seven or eight hundred people were enemies, in this moment, all grudges and hostilities mattered little.

Because nearly all of these seven or eight hundred had been wiped out.

Puddles of crimson blood, severed limbs, and fragmented flesh littered the ground.

All in the span of a tea break, the allied forces of the Seven Great Families were almost entirely annihilated by the joint assault of the two Evil Kings.

Yang Kai felt a surreal chill.

Even with the extraordinary methods and special arts of these Evil Kings, the opponents should not have been so completely defeated.

Looking more closely, Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

Because he noticed a number of people had scattered like birds and beasts, fleeing desperately towards Zhongdu.

And these people were the stronger ones among the seven or eight hundred.

Though the Ghost King and Poison King were powerful, many strong figures were present.

But instead of uniting to counterattack, they only cared about their own escape; those who failed to flee perished miserably.

Especially the Qiu, Huo, and Liu families’ experts. Since Qiu Yimeng, Huo Xingchen, and Liu Qingyao were not present there, they didn’t need to fight much.

Instead, the Ye, Kang, and Gao family warriors suffered heavy losses because they had to protect their masters and could not withdraw easily.

After Gao Rangfeng died, the remaining Gao Family warriors dared not linger, retreating hastily.

Out of the seven or eight hundred, fewer than a hundred escaped; all the others were left behind, not even brushing the robes of the Ghost King or Poison King.

“Eight Great Families!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, a mocking smile at the corner of his mouth as he waved his hand, “Retreat!”

His main purpose for coming here was to rescue Yang Wei and Yang Zhao.

The eldest brother, Yang Wei, had not clashed with Yang Kai since the Succession War and had even cooperated with him once. Yang Kai held respect for this elder brother.

The second brother, Yang Zhao, had ultimately refused the leadership of the Seven Great Families coalition, instead handing command to Ye Xinrou, apparently disdainful of relying on the coalition’s strength to defeat Yang Kai.

This moved Yang Kai somewhat.

Blood ties still existed. Despite Yang Zhao’s cunning and scheming, Yang Kai could not ignore him.

With the plan successful and no reason to remain any longer, Yang Kai naturally sought to withdraw quickly.

Upon hearing his order, the Blood Servants protecting Yang Kai surrounded him tightly, safeguarding his safety as they prepared to leave.

“Yang Kai! Save us!” Ye Xinrou’s heart-wrenching voice came through, her beautiful eyes shining with an unusual light, as if she had just glimpsed hope, urgently calling out to Yang Kai.
