## Chapter 2593 — No Sense of Security

Climbing up in a sorry state, a barely perceptible glint flashed in Yang Kai's eyes. His hands quickly formed a series of seals, and the Mountain and River Bell, which had been blasted away, suddenly spun in place, swelling to the size of a house. A world-suppressing force surged forth, rumbling as it crashed down toward Shi Huo, who was steadily advancing on him.

"Careful!" Cang Gou's expression changed slightly as he called out a warning.

Shi Huo was also greatly shocked. He hadn't expected Yang Kai's physical resilience to be so formidable—after taking a blow from him, albeit indirectly, he hadn't suffered much harm at all. If it had been an ordinary First Stage Emperor, they would probably be dead by now.

That world-suppressing force caused his body to freeze for a moment. As the Mountain and River Bell came crashing down from above, he tried to dodge, but it was already too late.

Boom...

Under the watchful eyes of all present, the massive Mountain and River Bell sealed Shi Huo inside, fitting perfectly.

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai threw his head back and laughed wildly, wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth. His eyes sparkled with reckless delight as he shouted, “No matter how cunning you are, you’ll still have to drink this Young Master’s foot-washing water!”

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou all wore dark expressions.

The Four Great Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land, though they often found fault with each other and had their share of minor conflicts and disputes, were ultimately bound together for better or worse.

Now that Shi Huo had been suppressed by Yang Kai using the Mountain and River Bell, the other three's expressions were all quite unsightly. This Shi Huo... had really disgraced the Saint Venerables. Even though Yang Kai had relied on the power of a Primordial Era artifact to accomplish this, his cultivation was still low. In the eyes of the Saint Venerables, a First Stage Emperor was no different from an ant.

Now that Shi Huo had been suppressed by an ant, it was a slap in the face.

Boom, boom, boom...

Suddenly, a series of explosions and furious roars erupted from within the Mountain and River Bell. Clearly, the enraged Shi Huo was pounding against it, trying to break free.

But the world-suppressing power of this Primordial Era artifact was extraordinary. The True Phoenix Fire had been suppressed by it for tens of thousands of years, unable to move at all. Even though Shi Huo was a Divine Spirit, he was powerless. On the contrary, his wild thrashing caused the bell's resonant hum to make the surrounding Yao Kings' qi and blood churn, their faces contorted in discomfort. The weakest, Hu Li and the heavily injured burly Saint Envoy, even coughed up blood, their faces pale.

Shi Huo, trapped inside the Mountain and River Bell, was probably faring no better. Each toll of the bell contained immense power, and being inside, he bore the brunt of it.

"Shi Huo, stop!" Fan Wu barked coldly.

Shi Huo seemed to realize something was wrong. Upon hearing this, he indeed ceased his reckless assault, leaving only the sound of heavy breathing from within the Mountain and River Bell, like a trapped beast. Each breath was laced with boundless fury and murderous intent.

Being suppressed here by Yang Kai, Shi Huo was practically fuming with rage, as if his lungs were about to explode. His yao fire surged uncontrollably, like a volcano on the verge of eruption.

"Boy, you have some nerve!" Fan Wu stared coldly at Yang Kai and said indifferently, "Release Shi Huo, or you will surely die."

Yang Kai chuckled, swaying slightly where he stood, but his expression was utterly unconcerned. "If you want to make a move, go ahead," he said. "I know full well I can't escape from you all. Since I can't leave, I might as well stay put."

"You're not afraid of death?" Fan Wu snorted coldly.

Yang Kai shot him a cold look and said flatly, "It would be easy for you all to kill me, but if you do... Shi Huo will probably be suppressed in there for many years. Maybe one day, someone will be able to subdue the Mountain and River Bell and let Shi Huo out, but it definitely won't be any of you present."

At these words, the Saint Venerables' expressions all darkened.

They all knew Yang Kai was right. Back when the Mountain and River Bell was still in the Wild Ancient Land tens of thousands of years ago, they had tried many times to subdue it, but none had succeeded. In the end, it was actually stolen by a person named Origin Cauldron.

It was a tremendous humiliation!

If they really killed Yang Kai today, things would turn out just as he said—Shi Huo would remain suppressed in the Mountain and River Bell unless someone could one day subdue this Primordial Era artifact and release him.

Luan Feng narrowed her beautiful eyes and said, "Young friend, you're still so young. Why speak of death so lightly? Let Shi Huo go, and we can talk things over."

Yang Kai sneered, "Earlier, when I wanted to leave, it was you who insisted on keeping me. Now you want to talk things over? I really don't feel safe at all."

Fan Wu and Luan Feng both looked a bit awkward, feeling as if they'd shot themselves in the foot.

Taking a deep breath, Luan Feng asked, "Then what would make you feel safe?"

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, glanced around, and said, "Let me take the Stone Spirit Race and leave first. Once we're several thousand li away, I'll put away the Mountain and River Bell and release Shi Huo. That way, maybe I'll feel a bit safer."

As long as he could get several thousand li away, he could take the Stone Spirit Race and flee far, far away. By then, no one would be able to stop him.

Fan Wu said, "Don't you think that's too much? If you just want to leave by yourself, this Lord could turn a blind eye, but why drag the Stone Spirit Race into it?"

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, "You have thirty-two Yao Kings and eight Saint Envoys under your command. The Stone Spirit Race is just icing on the cake. Forced loyalty is never sweet. Why insist? Instead of forcing the Stone Spirit Race to serve you, why not let them go free? I'm sure the Elder would be grateful, and if you ever run into trouble in the future, they might even help you."

Fan Wu sneered, "What trouble could this Lord possibly encounter?"

Yang Kai straightened his expression and replied solemnly, “Who can say what the future holds? Fortune turns with time.”

"Are you sure you want to do this?" Fan Wu's smile faded as he asked calmly.

Yang Kai said nothing, only meeting his gaze with unwavering determination.

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou exchanged glances, their Divine Senses surging as they communicated silently.

Outwardly, Yang Kai appeared calm, but inside, his heart was pounding.

Now that he had used the Mountain and River Bell to suppress Shi Huo, he had bought himself a sliver of hope. But who knew if the remaining three Saint Venerables would care about Shi Huo at all? If they decided to kill him even if it meant leaving Shi Huo suppressed forever, he'd have no choice but to fight to the death.

The odds weren't good, but it was better than surrendering without a fight.

Just as Yang Kai was feeling anxious, Fan Wu looked over again, as if he and Luan Feng and Cang Gou had reached some consensus.

Yang Kai's heart tightened as he focused on him.

"Your condition..." Fan Wu spoke calmly, "this Lord agrees."

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally let out a long breath, a wave of relief and gratitude washing over him as though he’d just escaped a great calamity. After all, Fan Wu was a Saint Venerable—since he’d given his word, he would not go back on it.

"However..." Fan Wu suddenly changed the subject, making Yang Kai, who had just relaxed, tense up again. "This Lord has one more condition."

Yang Kai's face darkened as he hesitated, "What condition?"

He secretly decided that if the other party's condition was too much, he would fight them to the end.

"This bell..." Fan Wu pointed at the Mountain and River Bell, his tone brooking no argument. "It must be left behind."

The Mountain and River Bell was simply too dangerous. The Saint Venerables couldn't subdue it, and if it fell into someone else's hands, it would be a threat to them. Hadn't Yang Kai, with just the First Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivation, managed to suppress Shi Huo with it?

If a Third Stage Emperor got hold of it, wouldn't they be able to suppress all four of them? So, no matter what, it had to stay. If they couldn't use it, no one else could either.

Yang Kai's eyes widened as he gritted his teeth. "Isn't that demand a bit too overbearing, sir?"

Fan Wu snorted, "You trespassed into the Blood Gate forbidden land, which is a capital offense. This Lord is already showing mercy by sparing your lives. You have no right to bargain!"

Luan Feng added, "A Secret Treasure is, after all, just an external object. Leaving it behind in exchange for your dozen or so lives—isn't that a fair trade, young friend?"

Cang Gou also smiled slightly, "Besides, this bell is originally a treasure of the Ancient Land. Now, it's simply returning to its rightful place."

"That's right!" Fan Wu nodded slightly.

Yang Kai nearly ground his teeth to dust. No one knew better than him how powerful the Mountain and River Bell was. This Primordial Era artifact had taken him over a year to subdue in the Shattered Star Sea. If he handed it over now, all that effort would be wasted, and he'd lose a trump card. No matter how he looked at it, it was a huge loss.

But Luan Feng's words weren't wrong either. A Secret Treasure was, after all, just an external object. Compared to his own life and the future of the Stone Spirit Race, it really wasn't worth much.

Most crucially... he was no match for them now. If he refused, Shi Huo would remain trapped, but he himself would be doomed, and the Stone Spirit Race's future would be bleak.

"Fine!" Yang Kai shouted, full of unwillingness. "I'll leave the Mountain and River Bell behind—consider it entrusted to your safekeeping. But one day, I will come and take it back myself!"

Cang Gou sneered disdainfully, "What a boast."

He didn't deny that Yang Kai's talent was impressive, and he had a good chance of reaching the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. But to take the Mountain and River Bell back from them? He'd probably have to become a Great Emperor first.

Fan Wu also shook his head and smiled, clearly not taking Yang Kai's words to heart. He said, "Since you've agreed, remove your Soul Brand from the bell. And don't try any tricks—this Lord will check personally. If I find anything amiss, don't blame me for being ruthless."

Yang Kai cried out, “My lord, are you joking? If I remove my Soul Brand now, won’t Shi Huo come charging out to settle the score with me?”

Luan Feng smiled gently, "You're quite cautious. Don't worry, with us here, Shi Huo won't be able to do anything to you."

Yang Kai shook his head, "I don't believe it. Unless you make him swear."

Fan Wu and the others' faces darkened. They secretly felt Yang Kai was being too unreasonable. Their status was clear, and they'd already said so much, yet this brat was still making excuses. It was infuriating.

From inside the Mountain and River Bell came Shi Huo's furious roar: "Insolent brat! What right do you have to make this Lord swear!"

Yang Kai's face was cold as he said, "If you have no ill intent, what's the harm in swearing? Or is it that Lord Shi Huo really plans to come after me the moment he's released? If that's the case, then be prepared to stay trapped in there forever. My life is cheap, and if it means you stay suppressed for a lifetime, it's worth it."
