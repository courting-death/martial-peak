## Chapter 1713 — Ming Yue

“Old bastard, you dare offend the Island Lord’s authority? Hand over your life!” A furious shout rang out from afar. From the end of the street, a figure charged toward Sha Hu with an overwhelming aura, shouting loudly as he ran — clearly eager to earn merit.

Ghost Isle’s management was extreme in its strictness, and riots or uncontrolled incidents seldom occurred, so the warriors who followed Ming Yue had hardly any chances to show themselves; today was undoubtedly a golden opportunity, and the man had seized it, intending to take a stab at Sha Hu.

If he could please Ming Yue, he would surely be rewarded with at least a fine bottle of Huntian Pills.

So as soon as he heard Sha Hu’s roar, he immediately hurried over.

Halfway through his charge, he summoned a massive blade-shaped Secret Treasure into his hand. Combined with his burly frame, his aura was fierce and unstoppable — a force that seemed ready to cut down gods and men alike.

Sha Hu stood quietly in place, his gaze fixed upon the island’s center, on that tallest building.

From there seemed to come a stern, malevolent stare that watched from afar; it locked eyes with Sha Hu and their gazes met, colliding in midair to spark fierce flashes — an invisible force that chilled the whole of Ghost Isle, causing many to shiver involuntarily.

The burly man bearing the blade was entirely unaware; he charged until he was ten zhang from Sha Hu, then leapt high and slashed a brilliant arc with his long blade, a cold smile curled at his mouth: “Old fool, I’ll take your head.”

Sha Hu turned his head slowly and looked toward the attacker.

At that sight the man sucked in a cold breath, his face filling with terror; his once unstoppable aura instantly dissolved like snow under the fierce sun, and a strange hoarse sound escaped his throat.

He exhaled sharply as his body plummeted straight from midair, landing with both feet sinking deep into the ground. Staring wide-eyed at Sha Hu, his trembling voice stammered, “Is… is that Island Lord Sha?”

It was obvious this burly man recognized Sha Hu.

Sha Hu gave a cold smile. “Zhou An! A hundred years and you still haven’t improved.”

Zhou An’s face reddened with embarrassment, then broke into anger. “Whether Zhou An has improved or not is not for you to decide. But Island Lord Sha, how are you still alive?”

“Ming Yue said I was dead?” Sha Hu gave a faint, icy laugh, looking at Zhou An as though he were an idiot. “And you actually believed him? Not only am I alive, I’m living quite well. Today, I’ve come to take Ming Yue’s head — to vent the hatred festering in my heart!”

Zhou An’s expression flickered uncertainly. Though fear was written all over his face, his tone remained firm as he said, “Sha Hu, don’t delude yourself. Over the past century, Island Lord Ming Yue’s strength has advanced tremendously. You weren’t his match back then, and you’re still not now. Surrender quietly and come with me to see the Island Lord — perhaps you might still escape with your life. Otherwise…”

“Otherwise what?”

“The Island Lord defeated you a hundred years ago; a hundred years later you are still not his match!” Zhou An barked.

Sha Hu laughed heartily. “Idiot, didn’t Ming Yue ever tell you that he was more skilled back then because he used poison? Since I have returned, I will not give him that chance.”

He paid Zhou An no more mind and instead looked toward the tallest building, letting out a long roar: “Ming Yue, if you have no courage to come down and face me, then I’ll go up!”

With that he vaulted into the air, shooting up over ten zhang, approaching the very center of the island like a great roc spreading its wings.

“Foolish fantasy!” Suddenly angry shouts rang out; at least more than ten warriors wrapped in a crimson radiance burst from the crowd and leapt to intercept Sha Hu.

The crimson radiance around these warriors was a clear sign of vigorous Qi and blood; from the strength of that radiance one could gauge the fullness or weakness of their Qi and blood.

The Ghost Isle warriors Yang Kai had met earlier were either too weak or lacked true skill so they had not displayed such signs, but now, upon learning Sha Hu’s true identity, these more than ten experts no longer concealed their strength and mobilized everything they had.

Sha Hu ignored the pincer attack from those dozen or so and stared coldly ahead, expressionless, neither sad nor joyful, neither alarmed nor afraid — only killing intent surged like a tide.

The dozen or so beamed with joy; each forced his internal power and performed his killing moves, unleashing them toward Sha Hu.

But before their strikes could reach, a youth appeared behind Sha Hu in a strange instant, calmly suspended in midair as if walking on the winds.

Facing the ferocious pincer attack, the youth remained calm and smiling; when they drew near to a sufficient distance, he suddenly struck with both fists.

In midair, fist-phantoms rushed out like a driving storm, pouring forth to crash in all directions.

The dozen or so figures’ crimson radiance burst like bubbles; each was struck as if by a tremendous blow, and amid shrieks and cries they were flung backward, some of them exploding in midair.

Boom, boom, boom…

Those who did not die crashed into nearby houses, smashing great holes through roofs and walls, bleeding profusely, some with chunks of entrails among their blood, collapsing with life fading.

Several thousand spectators gasped in uproar, staring at the youth still suspended in midair, their eyes filled with terror.

The dozen or so who had tried to strike Sha Hu were all well-known experts on Ghost Isle; how strong they were in the outside world no one could say, but within Ghost Isle each of them was enough to rank among the top one hundred!

They were Ming Yue’s capable commanders!

Yet before this young man’s onslaught, more than a dozen of them were either dead or gravely wounded — not a single one could stand back up. It was, in every sense, a total annihilation!

Who was this youth? Why had he never been seen before?

Compared with this youth, Sha Hu’s renown was already known to many; within Ghost Isle more than Zhou An recognized Sha Hu — many in the crowd remembered the former Island Lord Sha from a hundred years ago.

News spread from one to ten and from ten to a hundred, and soon all the warriors on Ghost Isle knew the situation: the former Island Lord had come to take revenge on the current Island Lord! This was a once-in-a-millennium spectacle no one was willing to miss.

But the youth who had just displayed overwhelming might now stood blocking the way ahead, and none dared to step forward to watch the commotion. Even those cultivators under Ming Yue’s command didn’t dare to move rashly — the miserable fate of the dozen before them was still vivid in their minds, the faint sounds of their dying groans still lingering in their ears. Anyone who didn’t wish for death wouldn’t dare provoke Yang Kai again.

Yang Kai glanced around and grinned, saying, “Elder Sha wants to challenge Ming Yue; you men should watch from afar. If any of you is stupid enough to step forward, don’t blame this Yang for being merciless.”

Normally, such words from an unremarkable youth would draw no attention, but after he had single-handedly repelled a combined strike from more than ten experts, his words carried absolute authority.

No one dared provoke him; the onlookers stood at a distance, gazing to see who was stronger between the former and the current Island Lord.

In the island’s center a great battle had clearly erupted; Sha Hu’s furious roars carried far, as if bloodlust surged — even from over ten li away the forceful intent born from their colliding fists could be felt, the air boomed and trembled and the sound filled the ears, stirring both blood and terror.

Yang Kai stood for a moment, drew a line on the ground with his finger, then without looking back strode toward the battlefield.

Even after he left, no one dared cross that mark; they could only watch the tremendous battle from afar, anxious yet unable to see clearly.

Yang Kai took only a dozen or so breaths to cover the more than ten li distance.

Beneath the tallest building at the island’s center lay several mangled corpses, evidently slain by Sha Hu.

A number of warriors stood not far off, watching closely with faces full of puzzled doubt.

They dared not intervene; when Sha Hu had arrived he struck down a few with thunderous force and had established an image of overwhelming ferocity — only those who wished to die would trouble Sha Hu.

Now only Ming Yue stood opposite Sha Hu, locked in combat.

Yang Kai paid no heed to the watching experts and turned his gaze to Ming Yue.

He was a refined-looking middle-aged man, carrying an air of scholarly grace, dressed like a scholar; in temperament he was somewhat reminiscent of Great Elder Mo Yu of Qiantian Sect.

Yet his physical strength surpassed Mo Yu by countless times.

The crimson radiance surrounding him was thick and dense, displaying the might of his Qi and blood; every movement of his carried the roar of dragons and the bellow of tigers, as if he could rend heaven and earth.

Sha Hu’s own Qi and blood radiance was in no way inferior; when Yang Kai arrived the two were exchanging blows, the fight fierce and earth-shaking — deep pits appeared in the ground, surrounding buildings toppled, and even one side of the central building had been smashed in and leaned askew.

Yang Kai watched for a while and could not help lifting a brow.

Sha Hu regarded Ming Yue as his lifelong enemy; every mention of Ming Yue was filled with loathing and hatred, and clearly not without reason.

Yang Kai could assert that three months ago Sha Hu was absolutely not Ming Yue’s match; judging from Sha Hu’s power when they first met, he could not have lasted a hundred breaths under Ming Yue’s hands.

But in these three months Sha Hu had taken many Huntian Pills he had personally refined and had made certain breakthroughs in his bodily strength; compared with three months earlier he was far stronger, which was why he could now fight Ming Yue toe to toe and not be outclassed.

Their combat was barbaric and crude, a style of trading wounds for wounds.

Such a style suited warriors with powerful bodies, because with sturdy bodies and vigorous Qi and blood the injuries were not so severe and recovery was easier.

Yang Kai had used such a method more than once to kill powerful enemies.

But when both parties’ bodily strength was balanced, that approach truly could only exchange wounds.

What decided the final victory was one’s own perseverance and resolution!

In this regard Sha Hu undoubtedly held the advantage.
