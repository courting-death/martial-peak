## Chapter 2157 — Fierce Battle

The puppet's appearance was bizarre, resembling a giant lizard walking upright. Its forelimbs were short, its hind legs extremely long, and its entire body was shrouded in an indescribable, menacing aura.

The moment it looked at Yang Kai, it immediately opened its huge mouth and spat out a crimson beam of light.

"Even a casual attack has the power of a Dao Origin Realm? These puppets... are truly extraordinary!" Yang Kai felt the energy impact from that beam, his expression changing slightly as he quickly dodged to the side.

Whoosh...

The beam grazed Yang Kai's body and struck a martial artist who had entered right after him.

That martial artist was rather fortunate, for before coming in, he had already summoned a defensive armor-shaped Secret Treasure and was wearing it.

His intention had been to guard against Wuchang's sudden attack, but by a twist of fate, it ended up saving his life.

Boom! With a loud sound, the martial artist staggered back a few steps, the armor flashing with light, startling him into shouting, "What the hell is that thing?"

At that moment, a large group of people rushed in from the entrance, and even Gong Wenshan, who had been at the back of the hall, revealed himself.

Except for the few killed by Wuchang outside the Time Temple, only three were excluded and unable to enter.

With so many living beings present, the puppets that had been besieging Xiao Chen and the others scattered to seek new targets. The pressure on Xiao Chen and his group eased considerably, and, filled with pent-up anger, they unleashed a flurry of killing moves, sending nearby puppets flying. From time to time, a puppet would be shattered by a powerful attack, its fragments scattering across the floor.

Inside each shattered puppet, there was always a crystal about the size of a fist, radiating a strong energy fluctuation.

"Spirit Energy Core!" someone exclaimed, their eyes filled with greed as they stared at the crystal.

Yang Kai's heart stirred. He instantly realized what it was.

The Spirit Energy Core is the puppet’s vital heart. Without it, no matter how exquisite the craftsmanship, a puppet is nothing more than a lifeless husk. Only once the Spirit Energy Core is set in place can a puppet truly awaken and function.

However, Spirit Energy Cores were extremely difficult to refine, requiring the cooperation of both artifact refiners and puppet masters. Their value was always high, especially for high-grade ones, which were rare and hard to come by.

There were over a hundred puppets in the hall, and each one was at least Dao Origin-Grade. In other words, there were over a hundred Spirit Energy Cores here!

If all these Spirit Energy Cores were taken out and given to puppet masters to craft bodies for them, it would be possible to create a Dao Origin Realm-level puppet army!

Martial artists like Xiao Chen, Kong Qi, and Xiao Baiyi, who came from top forces, might not care much about the value of these Spirit Energy Cores, but those from small sects and families were different. In those forces, cultivating a Dao Origin Realm expert was a painstaking process, but a single Spirit Energy Core was equivalent to a Dao Origin Realm's combat power.

For this reason, how could the martial artists not fight over them? Even if their own sect couldn't craft puppet bodies, a Spirit Energy Core could be sold for a considerable amount of Source Crystals.

So, after the initial chaos, the martial artists who rushed in all went mad, summoning their Secret Treasures and unleashing killing moves at the puppets.

The puppets, though numerous and powerful, couldn't display their full strength without anyone to control them, so they quickly began to lose ground.

The martial artists who rushed in didn't care at all. Some formed groups of three or five to attack together, while others confidently fought alone. Every moment, puppets were being shattered, and the price paid by the martial artists was minimal—only a few were seriously injured, and not a single one had died.

Yang Kai also took the opportunity to slay a few puppets, collecting several Spirit Energy Cores and tossing them into his Spatial Ring.

As time passed, the number of puppets in the hall dwindled. The martial artists grew more and more courageous, and it was only a matter of time before all the puppets were wiped out.

Just then...

A dazzling light suddenly burst from somewhere in the crowd, drawing everyone's attention.

Up in midair, a five-pointed glow twirled a few times, then, faster than thunder, it streaked into a stream of light and sank into a male cultivator’s arm.

The martial artist seemed unsure of what had happened, only feeling a burning pain in his arm, which made him cry out in surprise.

"Star Seal!" Lan Xun's beautiful eyes lit up as she called out sweetly.

"These puppets... actually have Star Seals on them?" Xiao Chen's expression grew complicated as he turned to look at the surrounding puppets, searching for more Star Seals.

He had shattered at least six or seven puppets, but such good fortune hadn't come his way, leaving Xiao Chen feeling a bit bitter.

"Ah? This is a Star Seal?" The male martial artist, hearing Lan Xun's exclamation, was stunned for a moment before bursting into laughter. "I actually got a Star Seal? Hahaha, it seems even the heavens are favoring me!"

He was overjoyed and laughed heartily.

Even those around him who disliked his arrogance could only envy him.

After this scene, the martial artists' interest in killing and fighting over puppets clearly increased, and several people even scrambled for a single puppet.

In one corner of the hall, a man and a woman, seemingly fellow disciples, nervously and cautiously attacked a leopard-shaped puppet together.

This puppet looked almost identical to a real leopard, extremely agile and nimble, but fortunately, aside from close-range pouncing and biting, it seemed to have no other abilities.

So, although the two weren't very strong, taking it down wasn't a problem.

What made them nervous wasn't the leopard puppet's strength, but the triangular mark on its forehead!

The mark was unremarkable, and before this, the two might not have cared, but after what had just happened, they could easily guess that it was likely a Star Seal.

Dozens of Star Seals had previously fallen into the Time Temple, hidden throughout the temple. With over a hundred puppets here, it was normal for three or five Star Seals to be among them.

The two fellow disciples came from humble backgrounds and weren't very strong, so they feared that if they killed the leopard puppet and the Star Seal phenomenon was noticed, it would bring them trouble...

Though that man who seized the Five-Rayed Star Seal was all smiles, plenty had already fixed their sights on him. The instant he ended up alone, someone would make a move.

Thinking of this, the two fellow disciples exchanged a glance, nodding in silent understanding. Instead of killing the puppet immediately, they fought and retreated, luring the leopard puppet deeper into the temple, hoping to get out of sight before claiming the Star Seal.

The hall was in chaos. Even though their actions were obvious, no one paid attention, assuming they were simply not strong enough and forced to act that way.

Their plan and actions were successful, but just as they were about to leave the crowd, a figure suddenly descended from above, forming a fist with one hand and smashing down hard.

The two fellow disciples' hearts sank, and it was too late to act.

Boom!

The leopard puppet was smashed to pieces, and as it broke apart, the triangular mark on its forehead shot out, glowing as it flew toward the descending figure.

"Just a Triangular Star Seal?" The figure glanced at the back of his hand, seemingly dissatisfied, and turned to attack other puppets.

Seeing this, the woman bit her rosy lips, about to speak up in protest.

But the man turned pale, tugged at her clothes, slowly shook his head, and whispered, "That man is Luo Yuan... we can't afford to provoke him."

"But that Star Seal..." the woman said, unwilling to give up.

The man gave a bitter smile. "Just pretend we didn't see it."

"That was clearly ours," the woman said angrily. If they'd known Luo Yuan would suddenly appear, they would have dealt with the leopard puppet earlier and saved themselves the trouble.

The man continued to comfort her, finally persuading her not to confront Luo Yuan.

He understood that with someone like Luo Yuan, reason was useless. If you tried to reason with him, he'd answer with his fists.

The slaughter in the hall lasted a full hour. Dozens of top Dao Origin Realm martial artists from the various sects and families of the Southern Territory, after paying only minor costs, finally wiped out all the puppets.

Setting aside the windfall of the Spirit Energy Cores, three Star Seals had surfaced. Besides the first man’s Five-Pointed Star Seal and Luo Yuan’s triangular Star Seal, another appeared—a diamond-shaped Star Seal identical to the one on the back of Yang Kai’s hand.

This Star Seal was luckily obtained by Murong Xiaoxiao, who was naturally delighted, for now she qualified to enter the Shattered Star Sea and seek her own path to become an Emperor.

Only now did everyone have time to properly examine the hall.

The hall covered a vast area, and at this moment, puppet fragments littered the floor. Looking ahead, there was a clearly marked passage, which seemed to be the only exit.

There were no puppets guarding the exit, nor any traces of restrictive formations. It looked very safe.

However, everyone was cautious and did not rush toward the exit. Instead, they each found a place to sit cross-legged, recovering their energy while waiting for someone to take the first step.

Kong Qi of the Qiyao Commerce Guild suddenly approached Gong Wenshan from behind, smiling obsequiously as he cupped his fists and asked, "Brother Gong, what do you think of the situation over there?"

Gong Wenshan squinted at him and said, "Brother Kong, I've noticed you've become even more shameless than before. Why do you always come to me for everything? It's not like I created this Time Temple."

Kong Qi chuckled, entirely unfazed. "The capable should shoulder more, no? With Brother Gong’s grasp of formations and seals, if there really were any danger over there, you’d see through it in an instant."

"Since you're flattering me so shamelessly..." Gong Wenshan snorted, reluctantly stood up, and walked over, saying, "I suppose I'll go take a look then."
