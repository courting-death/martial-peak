## Chapter 130 — One's Own Plans

The four had indeed fully recovered and were waiting here for Yang Kai, while Nie Yong and the others grew increasingly impatient, muttering incessantly.

When Yang Kai finally arrived, Lan Chudie took a deep breath, her ample chest dramatically expanding, as if the tight-fitting garment she wore might burst apart. Her beautiful eyes scanned the surroundings: “Are you all ready?”

“Ready long ago!” Nie Yong replied, filled with excitement.

“Then let’s do it again.” She turned to Yang Kai and asked, “Do you want to switch someone else to distract those stone sculptures? This is a dangerous task after all.”

“No need, I’ve tried it once and already have some experience!” Yang Kai shook his head.

He truly did not want to fight against those stone sculptures; battling those lifeless beings made his limbs ache.

“Alright then! This time it’s all up to you.” Lan Chudie smiled slightly.

Whenever she smiled at him during such times, Yang Kai felt a strange sensation, as if she were bestowing him a smile before embarking on a perilous mission.

If it were Nie Yong, he would likely feel greatly encouraged, but directed at Yang Kai, it always felt somewhat lacking.

Without further ado, Yang Kai swiftly dashed toward the location where the stone sculptures were gathered.

As expected, the stone sculptures all rushed out again, but Lan Chudie and the others were not so fortunate this time. During the interception, they accidentally blocked an extra stone sculpture, leaving them flustered and nearly causing casualties.

In the end, Yang Kai managed to lure back two stone sculptures, and after a fierce battle, they were reduced to rubble.

This time, luck was on his side, as he unexpectedly obtained two Little Stone Men.

With this, the number of Little Stone Men had reached four. There were only five people in this small team, and as long as they gathered one more, each person could have one.

Yang Kai was filled with anticipation; what he lacked most was martial skills, so he naturally wanted to secure a Little Stone Man first to enhance his combat power.

In the following days, the five remained at this rocky hill, continuously luring out and slaying stone sculptures. After each battle, they would rest for half a day before repeating the cycle.

It was unclear whether it was a matter of luck or something else, but since that day they had obtained four Little Stone Men, the team had shattered a total of thirty stone sculptures without any further gains.

This was far from their expected outcome, leaving everyone somewhat disappointed.

Moreover, with each successive lure, Yang Kai found that these stone sculptures were becoming increasingly difficult to deal with. It wasn’t that their strength had increased, but rather that it was becoming harder to separate them.

Once, while Lan Chudie and the others were intercepting from behind, they inadvertently attracted over a dozen stone sculptures, forcing them to flee for their lives.

That time, they ran for over an hour in the rocky hill before finally shaking off all the stone sculptures.

The situation was becoming increasingly dangerous, yet the fifth Little Stone Man still did not appear.

After another grueling battle, they gathered to discuss their situation after resting for half a day.

“Why don’t we just call it quits? I feel like if we keep going, something bad is going to happen,” Nie Yong expressed his concerns.

Zuo An muttered, “We only have four sets of martial skills, but there are five of us. How do we divide that?”

A silence fell; no one would voluntarily give up their share of the benefits. Everyone had put in significant effort these past few days, hoping to obtain a set of Earth-Grade martial skills.

Nie Yong then turned his attention to Yang Kai, chuckling lightly, “Earlier, Senior Sister Lan also said that what we obtain will be distributed according to our contributions. Junior Brother Yang has the lowest strength and contributed the least, so he shouldn’t take any martial skills, right?”

Yang Kai shot him a cold smile.

Nie Yong continued, “Of course, Junior Brother Yang has also contributed, so it wouldn’t be fair for him to get nothing. How about we each compensate him with some silver?”

Zuo An frowned, revealing a thoughtful expression. This suggestion clearly piqued his interest.

Du Yishuang firmly stated, “No way! A set of Earth-Grade martial skills cannot be compensated with just a bit of silver!”

Yang Kai remained coldly smiling. Although he was looking at Nie Yong, his peripheral vision was fixed on Lan Chudie. He wanted to know how this woman would respond in such a situation.

Her attitude would determine Yang Kai’s next move.

To his surprise, Lan Chudie remained silent!

Yang Kai’s cold smile deepened!

The awkward silence persisted for a long while before Lan Chudie finally spoke, “How about this? Let’s try again. Let’s see if we can obtain the last Little Stone Man. If it really doesn’t work, then one of us will definitely miss out on the Earth-Grade martial skills. But I, Lan Chudie, guarantee that whoever doesn’t get the Little Stone Man will definitely not suffer. Once we return to the sect, I will find a way to compensate!”

Her words seemed directed at all four of them, but Yang Kai knew she was primarily addressing him.

Among those present, Yang Kai had the lowest strength and contributed the least to the team, so if Lan Chudie were to offend anyone, it would only be him.

“This might be our last chance, everyone must put in their best effort!” Lan Chudie said, standing up and turning to Yang Kai with a gentle smile, “Junior Brother Yang, I’ll trouble you again.”

Yang Kai gave her a meaningful glance, silently nodded, and then stood up to head toward the stone sculptures.

Noticing his cold demeanor, a hint of regret flashed in Lan Chudie’s beautiful eyes, but it quickly vanished.

Having lured the stone sculptures was something Yang Kai had done many times these past few days, so he was naturally adept at it. However, this time, he had other plans.

He approached the stone sculptures as usual, inching closer step by step. Once they all moved, Yang Kai calmly turned and ran back, observing the movements of the last few stone sculptures.

When the last few stone sculptures crowded together, Yang Kai was satisfied and dashed away.

As before, he rushed past the ambush of the other four, with dozens of stone sculptures rumbling behind him.

Lan Chudie and the others seized the opportunity to intercept, but this time, the last few stone sculptures were all stopped, with as many as four of them.

Lan Chudie’s expression changed, and she quickly shouted, “Nie Yong, take two away!”

“Why me!” Nie Yong exclaimed, panic evident on his face.

Du Yishuang coldly mocked, “Didn’t you say that distracting the stone sculptures is the easiest thing? Yang Kai can lure away dozens or even hundreds, and you can’t even handle two?”

“Who said I can’t!” Nie Yong’s anger was ignited, and he immediately unleashed his techniques, enveloping two stone sculptures in his attacks. Once he had fully attracted them, he hurriedly ran off into the distance.

There were still two stone sculptures left, but there were three people remaining, so with a little time, they could surely handle them.

While the four were fighting hard on this side, Yang Kai was still leading the dozens of stone sculptures in a mad dash through the rocky hill.

Unlike before, this time Yang Kai deliberately controlled the distance, ensuring he wouldn’t shake them off.

After running for a full fifty miles, Yang Kai finally leaped onto a stone pillar and looked back at the stone sculptures following him.

The plan had succeeded halfway! Yang Kai felt a sense of relief, but he was unsure if his guess was correct.

The reason he wanted to make Lan Chudie and the others intercept four stone sculptures wasn’t that he wanted to use them as a tool to harm others; he wasn’t that malicious.

The four stone sculptures were definitely within their capabilities to handle; it would just take some time. Yang Kai wanted them to waste more time so that his subsequent plans would go unnoticed.

Regardless of whether they could obtain the Little Stone Man this time, Yang Kai would no longer place his hopes on others. This woman, Lan Chudie, was too pragmatic; he couldn’t expect her to act fairly.

If they still ended up with nothing this time, Yang Kai was certain that those four Little Stone Men would definitely not include him!

Thus, if he wanted something good, he could only rely on himself.

For the past few days, Yang Kai had been pondering a question: why did these stone sculptures return after being lured away? He finally arrived at an answer—perhaps they were guarding something.

That something should be far more valuable than the martial skills contained within the Little Stone Men.

This was merely a guess, but it was worth a risk!

Having lured all the stone sculptures to this place, he had fifty miles of distance to utilize.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai’s True Yang Primordial Qi surged wildly within him. Two flames flickered beneath his feet, and he shot back along the original path like an arrow released from a bow.

This time, his speed was actually twice as fast as before!

This was a method Yang Kai had discovered for using True Yang Primordial Qi; it couldn’t be considered a martial skill, just a technique.

The advantage was that it could elevate his speed to the limit, while the drawback was that it consumed a great deal of energy! The True Yang Primordial Qi within his meridians surged forth like a flood that had burst its dam.

In just a short while, his meridians ran dry.

A drop of Yang Liquid in his Dantian exploded, replenishing his depleted meridians.

After consuming four drops of Yang Liquid, Yang Kai finally returned to the location where the stone sculptures had gathered.

This was a flat area, but Yang Kai hadn’t carefully examined the specific terrain before; every time he had lured the stone sculptures, he had no time for that.

Now, the place was empty, and Yang Kai quickly looked around, searching nearby in a hurry.

If his guess was correct, then there must be something here.

After searching for a moment, Yang Kai indeed made a discovery.

In the exact center of this flat area, there was a massive pit, and within it stood a stone sculpture that was somewhat different from the others.

This stone sculpture was far more imposing in both size and shape than the other stone sculptures.

This was it!

Without a moment's hesitation, Yang Kai jumped down and quietly approached it.

Having had many experiences, Yang Kai knew that once he got within a foot of these stone sculptures, they would spring to life.

He was prepared to flee at any moment; this was not a place for battle. If he waited too long, those dozens of stone sculptures would likely return, and if he were surrounded by them, it would be a life-or-death situation.

However, to Yang Kai’s surprise, after he got within a foot of this stone sculpture, it didn’t move at all, causing him to stop in his tracks.

What was going on?

After several attempts to test it, this stone sculpture still showed no reaction! Yang Kai’s courage grew significantly; regardless of why it wasn’t moving, this was a great opportunity to strike.

With his True Yang Primordial Qi surging wildly, Yang Kai wasted no time and began to unleash a flurry of powerful punches against the stone sculpture, aiming to smash it as quickly as possible.
