## Chapter 934 — You Have Some Conscience

The Blood Servants Hall suffered grievous losses, and the surviving Blood Servants sat in a mournful, solemn silence.

Aside from the Blood Servants Hall, several of the clan's senior elders also perished in the fighting.

The head of the Elder Hall, Yang Zhen, was brutally slain by members of the Xiaoyao Divine Cult.

This catastrophe instantly reduced the Yang Family's high-end strength by nearly half — the greatest blow in its history.

It wasn't only the Yang Family; among the Zhongdu Eight Great Families, almost every household suffered similarly.

Fortunately, Wu Zheng did not seek total extermination; confident in his own might, he believed none in Zhongdu could make much of a wave against him. After an initial round of slaughter, he sealed away the powers of the various great families' masters and ordered them to submit and serve him.

He had his sights on the manpower here.

Whether he dragged them back to the Tongxuan Continent to work as laborers or sold them into slavery, it would be a considerable fortune.

Because of this, the Zhongdu Eight Great Families avoided annihilation and retained a sliver of hope.

"Ninth Brother, that Wu Zheng's methods are extraordinary and his strength earth-shattering — can the people you brought really deal with him?" Yang Zhao asked, uneasy.

"Yes, I never imagined there could be anyone so formidable in this world," some of the elders worriedly added.

"Whether they can handle him, we'll see," Yang Kai chuckled, listened for a moment, and then nodded, "They're already back."

"What's already back?" Yang Zhao exclaimed in surprise.

A striking figure slipped into the hall, wrapped in a bone-chilling cold; Han Fei appeared.

She carried a bloodied head in her hand, strode straight in, casually tossed the head onto the floor, and bowed to Yang Kai: "Master, I have not failed you!"

"Well done," Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Everyone in the hall turned their gaze to the head rolling on the floor; staring at the pair of wide, dead eyes, Yang Zhao slowly straightened and barked, "It's Wu Zheng!"

"He's really dead?"

"Serves him right!" Many in the Yang Family brightened, their expressions elated.

Looking at Han Fei, each person's eyes were filled with respect and gratitude.

Earlier, Li Rong had rushed here to eliminate the elites Wu Zheng brought — decisive and swift. Before anyone could react, those Xiaoyao Divine Cult disciples were dead; they had not seen Li Rong's methods and did not know the extent of her ferocity.

But now, seeing Wu Zheng's head carried in by Han Fei, they realized just how formidable this icy-tempered beauty truly was.

For a moment it felt unreal, like a dream; many even leaned in to take a closer look to confirm whether that really was Wu Zheng's head.

Once confirmed, their bodies trembled.

"Ninth Brother, this lady is..." Yang Zhao hesitated, staring at Han Fei with a strange look.

"We are the master's subordinates," Han Fei explained proactively, so no one would misunderstand.

Yang Zhao's face twitched; he didn't know what to say.

Ninth Brother had left more than ten years ago with no word, and now he returned with such powerful subordinates, sweeping away the invaders and saving Zhongdu. In contrast, as head of the Yang Family he had been helpless when the enemy struck; comparing the two, Yang Zhao felt a bit despondent.

"But this is good — with such a formidable lady, our Yang Family will no longer be bullied."

"Old Ninth, are you staying this time?"

The brothers bombarded him with questions.

Yang Kai shook his head.

Dong Suzhu, who sat beside Yang Kai, went pale, gripped his hand, and whispered, "Kai, are you still going to leave?"

Yang Kai smiled: "I'm leaving, but this time I'm taking you all with me."

"Leaving together?" Yang Zhao frowned.

"That's right. I hope everyone will come with me to the Tongxuan Continent and abandon Zhongdu."

Silence fell in the hall; Zhongdu was their root, and Yang Kai's words asking them to give it up made them reluctant.

Yang Kai understood their feelings. Standing, he said, "Once the Yang Family ruled here as the head of the Eight Great Families and was among the foremost powers in the world, but now the situation has changed. The passage to the Tongxuan Continent has opened. This time came Wu Zheng; next time it may be others. Staying in Zhongdu is no longer safe."

"More people will come?" Many faces changed — they had not grasped the seriousness of the situation.

They assumed that with Wu Zheng dead they could rest easy, but the facts were not so simple.

In Yang Kai's words, this place had already become a prize that experts wanted to gnaw on.

"If that's the case, we should make plans," Yang Zhao said gravely. After a moment's thought, he turned to Yang Kai: "Ninth Brother, Second Brother has a few questions for you."

Yang Kai nodded.

"If we follow you to that Tongxuan Continent, can people of our strength live there in safety? Second Brother is not being unduly modest, but after this incident we truly recognize our shortsightedness and shortcomings."

"Yes. I have some standing over there and can put in a word."

Yang Zhao's eyes brightened: "And places to settle us? Are there suitable positions?"

"There are; I've already found them. You needn't worry."

Yang Zhao pressed on: "What about cultivation materials? Here we can obtain them, but over there we're unfamiliar — acquiring them won't be easy, will it?"

Yang Kai chuckled: "What I lack least now are cultivation materials. Crystal stones in abundance, Spirit-Grade and Saint-Grade materials beyond your imagination — I guarantee you'll have everything there and never have to worry about resources for cultivation."

The crowd stared, dumbfounded.

Tu Feng hesitated: "Young Master, I've heard of Spirit-Grade — what rank is Saint-Grade?"

"Above Spirit-Grade," Yang Kai explained.

"And what are crystal stones?" Tang Yuxian asked.

"This is a crystal stone," Yang Kai said as he casually tossed one to her. Yuxian caught it, and the Blood Servants crowded around, peering and poking like a group of country folk who'd never seen such things, eyes full of astonishment.

"My heavens, there's so much energy within this thing."

"And it seems you can absorb it directly and convert it into your True Yuan."

"In battle, if you had this, wouldn't recovery be very fast?"

Exclamations rose; the Blood Servants' faces flushed with excitement.

"Indeed, the Spiritual Qi over there cannot be compared to this place; anywhere there is far richer than this blessed land, so cultivators advance much faster."

Yang Kai described the many virtues of the Tongxuan Continent, and the Yang Family grew increasingly bright-eyed and expectant.

Rich Spiritual Qi, no need to worry about safety, abundant cultivation materials, and places to settle — Yang Kai had arranged everything; they only had to follow him.

"Of course, I'm only asking you to come with me; if someone truly can't bear to leave, I won't force them," Yang Kai clarified. "Those who wish to stay may remain. Not every arriving expert will act like Wu Zheng; perhaps future strong figures won't bully others. The choice is yours."

"The Qiu Family will go with you — will you take us?" a coquettish voice called from outside the hall.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and looked out.

A figure like a fluttering butterfly entered, eyes shining at Yang Kai, lips pressed in a slight smile; though she tried to appear composed, anyone could see her excitement and joy.

"The head of the Qiu Family has arrived," Yang Zhao stood to greet her.

"Beautiful lady, long time no see," Yang Kai said as he rose and watched the woman step inside.

Qiu Yimeng.

As decisive and resolute as ever, before others could make up their minds she had already chosen, entrusting her interests and future to Yang Kai without hesitation.

Qiu Yimeng's lashes trembled; she looked a little aggrieved, but quickly recovered and greeted him with warmth.

"Miss Luo," Yang Kai nodded to the woman standing behind her.

The woman, with a notably ample bosom, was Luo Xiaoman of Ziwei Valley and Qiu Yimeng's closest friend.

Ten years apart hadn't erased Luo Xiaoman's fear of Yang Kai; she only gave a faint nod and timidly hid behind Qiu Yimeng.

For some reason, whenever Luo Xiaoman saw Yang Kai's face she recalled the girl Bilo from the Cangyun Evil Land and the milky-white fluid that used to trickle at the corner of her mouth...

"The Qiu Family will go with you — Young Master, would you take more people?" Qiu Yimeng asked Yang Kai earnestly.

"Don't be so formal," Yang Kai grinned. "I never planned to take only the Yang Family; if you're willing, all the better."

"I'll give you some credit!" Qiu Yimeng scolded him playfully and beamed, and the hall brightened considerably.

"I heard Young Master Kai is back, is it true?" someone shouted from outside, voice full of excitement. Huo Xingchen burst into the Yang Family hall like a gust of wind, looking around and calling, "Where is Young Master Kai?"

The next moment he saw Yang Kai not far off and darted forward without ceremony, giving him a big bear hug and slapping his back hard: "Brother, you're back — Qiu Yimeng missed you to death."

Qiu Yimeng's pretty face changed; she bared her teeth and snapped, "Huo Xingchen, do you want me to tear your mouth off?"

Young Master Huo chuckled and finally let go of Yang Kai, his smile even broader: "Brother, I missed you too."

“You rascal, after more than ten years, how has your cultivation fallen so far behind?” Yang Kai laughed, and upon seeing those familiar faces, he too felt a surge of joy.
