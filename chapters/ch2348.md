## Chapter 2348 — Imperial-Grade Alchemist

After seeing Ye Hen off, Yang Kai greeted Chi Yue and the others, then entered seclusion.

The cultivations of Chi Yue and the others were still too low. If they wanted to improve, Spiritual Pills were absolutely essential. Yang Kai went into seclusion precisely to refine some pills for them. During this period, he had obtained quite a few Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines, enough to refine Spiritual Pills that would allow Chi Yue and the others to cultivate up to the Emperor Realm. In particular, the Origin Condensing Pill, which transformed Origin Qi, was especially important for them right now.

The side room was silent, with only the occasional whoosh of the furnace fire. Yang Kai was completely immersed in the art of alchemy.

His skill in alchemy had always kept pace with his cultivation, so ever since he began cultivating, he rarely needed to purchase Spiritual Pills. Any pills he needed, he could refine himself, fully self-sufficient.

On this trip, he had advanced to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm within the Thousand Leaves Sect’s secret realm, greatly increasing his strength. This made Yang Kai feel even more at ease when refining pills.

For each furnace of Origin Condensing Pills, he could usually produce seven or eight pills, and if luck was on his side, he could reach the perfect number of nine!

It should be known that even if an Imperial-Grade Alchemist personally refined Origin Condensing Pills, at most only nine pills could be produced per furnace. Nine was the ultimate number, and also the maximum number of Spiritual Pills that could be refined in a single batch.

Not only that, but the quality of the Origin Condensing Pills he refined was excellent. Nearly one in ten bore Pill Patterns.

This was true for Origin Condensing Pills, and the same held for other Spiritual Pills.

In the first month of seclusion, Yang Kai still needed to pay attention to controlling the fire, inscribing spirit arrays, and the timing of adding ingredients while refining. But as time passed, refining Dao Origin-Grade Spiritual Pills became as easy as eating or drinking—pure instinct, requiring little thought. He even had time to cultivate in between alchemy sessions.

With each batch of Spiritual Pills completed, Yang Kai’s alchemy skills improved rapidly. At the same time, his newly advanced Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation gradually stabilized, no longer as unsteady as before.

By the end of the second month, he had exhausted all his Dao Origin-Grade Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines, refining them all into Spiritual Pills.

By the third month, he had begun using Imperial-Grade materials for alchemy.

After experimenting with more than ten batches, he finally succeeded in refining a furnace of Imperial-Grade Lower-Level Spiritual Pills. The emergence of this batch signified that Yang Kai’s alchemy skills had truly reached the level of an Imperial-Grade Alchemist!

However, at the level of an Imperial-Grade Alchemist, he was still not very proficient and needed a large amount of Spiritual Herbs to practice.

Even so, Imperial-Grade Alchemists were extremely rare and highly respected throughout the Star Realm. If Yang Kai were to reveal this, there would hardly be a sect that wouldn’t scramble to recruit him.

Naturally, Yang Kai would never reveal that he was an Imperial-Grade Alchemist. He had always learned alchemy to serve his own cultivation, never intending to go far down the path of alchemy. That he had grown to this level was simply a matter of chance.

If a great sect really did recruit him, he would have no time to cultivate in the future, spending all his days dealing with medicinal ingredients and refining Spiritual Pills for those great sects.

Thinking back, it was the Great Dao Pill Tone he triggered on Shuiyue Star, the main star of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, that was the fundamental reason he could become an Imperial-Grade Alchemist. Without that Great Dao Pill Tone, he would never have reached this level.

That Great Dao Pill Tone was like being taught by the Heavenly Dao itself, imparting to him many ultimate mysteries of alchemy that had existed since the dawn of the world. The pill-collecting technique he now used—the Nine Heavens Profound Pill Technique—was something he comprehended thanks to that opportunity.

After advancing to Imperial-Grade Alchemist rank, Yang Kai began using a batch of special Spiritual Herbs to refine Spiritual Pills.

This batch of special Spiritual Herbs was precisely what he had obtained earlier in the secret realm of Thousand Leaves Sect, within Emperor Heaven Valley. There were quite a few of them, and because they had grown in Emperor Heaven Valley for many years, each one had absorbed the Emperor Intent and Imperial Aura of the valley.

Pills refined from these Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Fruits would certainly perfectly inherit that Emperor Intent and Imperial Aura.

In other words, by consuming these Spiritual Pills, one could thoroughly comprehend the profundity of Emperor Intent and the mysteries of Imperial Aura from the inside out, helping Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivators to grasp the realm of the Emperor. The actual effects of the pills themselves were secondary.

Both he and Hua Qingsi were at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and both were extremely eager for such special Spiritual Pills.

Yang Kai spent half a month refining all of those Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Fruits into Spiritual Pills, dividing them into several portions. He kept one for himself and set aside the others for Hua Qingsi and the rest.

Nearly four months of seclusion, spent entirely on refining Spiritual Pills—this was a first for Yang Kai. In the past, his secluded cultivation was always for training, and even if he occasionally refined pills, it never lasted this long.

After coming out of seclusion, Yang Kai swept out with his Divine Sense and found that Hua Qingsi and the others were nowhere to be seen. He had no idea where they had gone.

However, the rich Spiritual Qi filling the world made his spirits soar.

Compared to four months ago, the density of Spiritual Qi within Thousand Leaves Sect had undoubtedly increased by several levels. Although it still couldn’t compare to his Small Xuan Realm or the secret realm’s interior, it had improved significantly.

Yang Kai guessed this was because the entrance to the secret realm had been completely opened.

Previously, Ye Qinghan had told him that the secret realm was the source of Thousand Leaves Sect’s Spiritual Qi. Because the entrance had been sealed, the sect’s Spiritual Qi was insufficient, and the disciples’ cultivation speed was unsatisfactory. Now that Yang Kai had repaired the Space Array, Ye Hen had immediately opened the entrance, allowing the Spiritual Qi from the secret realm to flow into the sect.

This was only a few months of change. If Thousand Leaves Sect were given more time, the Spiritual Qi might become even denser, and the disciples' cultivation even more efficient.

Thousand Leaves Sect’s foundation was indeed impressive. If not for tens of thousands of years of silence, it would now be able to stand shoulder to shoulder with great sects like Qingyang Shrine.

Just then, a streak of light suddenly caught Yang Kai’s eye, flying rapidly toward him from afar.

The streak of light was incredibly fast. Yang Kai had only just noticed it before it appeared right in front of him.

When the light faded and the figure hidden within was revealed, Yang Kai’s eyes widened in astonishment as he looked ahead.

The streak of light was actually a snow-white tiger. This tiger was large and mighty, exuding an air of arrogance and ferocity that made even Yang Kai feel a bit apprehensive. As it pounced closer, the White Tiger let out a low growl, sending a gust of wind his way.

“Heavenly Puppet?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

If he hadn’t seen the Thousand Leaves Sect’s Heavenly Puppets before, Yang Kai would have thought this was a Thirteenth-Tier Demonic Beast. But now he knew this White Tiger wasn’t a living creature, but a Heavenly Puppet.

Liu Yan’s little head poked out from the broad back of the White Tiger. Her eyes widened in delight as she exclaimed, “Master, you’re out of seclusion?”

Yang Kai glanced at her and said sternly, “Why are you riding someone else’s White Tiger?”

Liu Yan pouted and said, “Xiao Bai is mine now. I can ride him wherever I want.”

“Yours?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened, but he quickly realized what Liu Yan meant and immediately beamed. “Well done!”

He had been considering how to ask Ye Hen for a Heavenly Puppet or two from Thousand Leaves Sect, but before he could even bring it up, Ye Hen had already given one to Liu Yan.

If it belonged to Liu Yan, didn’t that mean it was his as well?

But this name… why is it Xiao Bai again?

Yang Kai suddenly thought of Mo Xiaoqi. That little girl had a bunch of pet beasts—Xiao Bai, Xiao Hei, Xiao Hong, Xiao Lan, Xiao Huang… She never gave them proper names. Who knew how those pets felt about it?

Are all girls like this?

Liu Yan leapt lightly from the White Tiger’s back. Seeing Yang Kai staring at her pet beast with shining eyes, she immediately poured cold water on him: “This isn’t that White Tiger. It’s another one.”

“Hm?” Yang Kai was instantly disappointed. “Why not that White Tiger?”

He didn’t know what grade the last White Tiger was, but Yang Kai guessed it was definitely a top-tier puppet. Although this one looked similar, it was definitely not as good.

Liu Yan explained, “The Four Divine Beasts Heavenly Puppets are the Thousand Leaves Sect’s guardian treasures, anchoring the sect’s fortune. They cannot be taken away.”

Yang Kai asked, “Then how strong is this Xiao Bai?”

“First Stage of the Emperor Realm, if pushed to the limit,” Liu Yan replied without hesitation.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. “Isn’t there anything stronger?”

Liu Yan thought for a moment. “There is.” She paused, then said as a matter of course, “But none look as good as this one. The others are all strange and ugly. I don’t like them.”

“What’s the use of looking good!” Yang Kai was nearly exasperated. “Strength is what matters!”

Liu Yan’s face darkened. She snorted, “If I had a pockmarked, ugly face and disgusted you every day, how would you feel?”

Yang Kai was stunned. After thinking for a long time, he had no answer. Suddenly, he felt… Liu Yan made a lot of sense.

“Forget it. First Stage of the Emperor Realm is still First Stage of the Emperor Realm. Better to have it than not.” Yang Kai sighed, feeling that this great opportunity had been wasted by Liu Yan.

It was obviously unrealistic to go to Ye Hen and ask for another one now. Yang Kai couldn’t bring himself to do it.

Ye Hen had already been generous enough to give Liu Yan one.

Liu Yan said, “Don’t underestimate it. Xiao Bai is really fast. Maybe it’ll save your life one day!”

Yang Kai chuckled, “I’d like to know why Ye Hen gave this to you.”

“Because I explained the art of controlling puppets to him,” Liu Yan replied with a smile. Her puppet body was naturally able to control all of Thousand Leaves Sect’s puppets, so she was more than qualified to teach Ye Hen, saving him many years of exploration.

Grateful, Ye Hen naturally gave her one.

“What about the others?”

“They should be back soon. They’ve been helping Thousand Leaves Sect rebuild the sect these days.”

As they spoke, Yang Kai saw Chi Yue and the others flying over.

Soon, everyone landed without a single one missing. Upon seeing Yang Kai, they were overjoyed and immediately came up to ask about his seclusion.

Yang Kai answered each question. He found that Chai Hu’s cultivation had fully recovered, rising from the Void King Realm to the Dao Origin Realm. It seemed the poison in his body had been completely purged.
