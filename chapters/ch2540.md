## Chapter 2540 — Why Me

The five or six people in the cave had cultivation at various levels, ranging from the First Stage to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Yang Kai swept his gaze over them and saw that there were no Emperors present, so he didn’t pay them much mind.

These people also glanced at Yang Kai when he entered, but apart from their eyes lighting up at the sight of Zhang Ruoxi, they didn’t react much.

“Young man, young lady, come this way, there are still spots here!” Old Ban called out, leading Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi to the right side of the cave.

There was still a bit of space over there, so the three of them sat down cross-legged in turn, quietly waiting for the howling wind to pass.

The others in the cave also seemed to be acting alone. Each kept silent, so the whole cave was deathly quiet for a while, with only the sound of the wind constantly blowing, making it feel as if they had entered the depths of winter.

After a while, the wind grew stronger, and a few more people rushed in from outside, covered in dust, taking up the remaining spots.

This cave really wasn’t big—only enough for a dozen or so people to take shelter. Any more and it wouldn’t work. The latecomers had to stand at the edge of the cave, looking anxious and on edge, afraid the howling wind would blow in. If that really happened, they’d be the first to suffer.

“Old Ban, how long will this howling wind last?” Yang Kai observed for a while, noticing the wind outside was only getting stronger with no sign of stopping, so he asked Old Ban.

Old Ban replied, “It’s hard to say. Sometimes five or six days, sometimes just half a day. The howling wind rises and falls without any pattern. But after the thunder tide, there’s always a howling wind. Young man, remember this for when you return from the Ancient Land.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Thank you for the reminder, Old Ban.”

Old Ban smiled, “Actually, you don’t need to worry too much. The howling wind is terrifying, but as long as you find one of these caves to take shelter before it comes, you can rest easy.”

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, “From what you’re saying, there’s more than one cave like this in the passage?”

Old Ban nodded, “Of course there’s more than one. The whole Ancient Land passage is flanked by mountains on both sides, with a canyon less than a hundred li wide in the middle. Wherever the canyon nears the mountain walls, there are caves like this. I haven’t counted carefully, but there must be at least ten. These caves seem to be naturally formed, and because of the unique environment here, they’re incredibly tough—ordinary attacks can’t break them, nor can they be expanded. So if you want to find shelter, you have to be early. If you’re late, there won’t be any spots left. We were lucky this time. Every year, countless cultivators die in the passage because they can’t find shelter from the wind. Even if they’re lucky enough to find a cave, sometimes there’s just not enough space.”

Hearing this, Zhang Ruoxi couldn’t help sticking out her tongue, “No wonder I saw so many bones at the cave entrance when we came in.”

Old Ban sneered, “Those bones aren’t all from people killed by the howling wind. Most of them died at the hands of others.”

Zhang Ruoxi frowned, still not understanding what Old Ban meant, but he said, “Just wait a bit, young lady, and you’ll see what I mean.”

Zhang Ruoxi looked doubtful, but didn’t ask any more questions.

Just then, a figure suddenly shot in from outside, charging straight into the cave with an aggressive, impatient air.

Before the man could get close, a gaunt martial artist standing at the edge of the cave lifted his hand and suddenly struck out with a palm.

The newcomer wasn’t willing to back down and met the attack with a palm of his own.

With a loud bang, both men’s bodies shifted slightly, seemingly evenly matched.

The next moment, a disheveled figure landed at the cave entrance, glaring venomously and anxiously at the one who had blocked his way.

The skinny cultivator snorted coldly, looking displeased, “There’s no room left here. Go somewhere else, friend.”

“Where else is there!” the newcomer growled through gritted teeth. He’d clearly suffered a lot in the howling wind on his way here, his body’s glow flickering, obviously greatly depleted. Now, being blocked again, he was furious.

But the one who’d stopped him wasn’t weak. If they really fought, it was hard to say who’d win. Right now, finding shelter from the wind was most important, so he had no mood to fight.

His gaze swept past the skinny cultivator and the others at the entrance, then fixed on Old Ban inside.

Old Ban was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the weakest in the cave. If someone wanted to snatch a spot, Old Ban was the easiest target.

Since there was no spot, he’d just have to take one.

But before he could tell Old Ban to get out, he suddenly frowned, his eyes showing some fear as he glanced at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was just sitting there cross-legged, not releasing any aura, but as an Emperor Realm cultivator, his strength was unfathomable. The man couldn’t see through his cultivation at all. Plus, Yang Kai was sitting with Old Ban, clearly a companion. No matter Yang Kai’s true strength, he didn’t want to risk being outnumbered.

After a brief hesitation, the man’s gaze moved away from Old Ban, pointed, and shouted, “Hey, kid over there, get out! That spot’s mine!”

In the direction he pointed, there was a man in his early thirties hiding in the shadows, keeping himself shrunk down as if not wanting anyone to notice him.

His cultivation was the same as Old Ban’s—only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Hearing the shout, the young man shrank back even more, pretending not to hear.

The man sneered, “I’ll give you three breaths. If you don’t get out yourself, I’ll make you, and whether you live or die will be up to fate.”

Seeing he couldn’t avoid it, the young man finally looked up, aggrieved, “Why me? Why is it always me!”

He’d been the first to reach this cave after the thunder tide, hiding in the deepest part, but now he’d been singled out.

The man’s cultivation was two Stages higher than his. If he really used force, the young man had no way to resist.

But with the howling wind about to hit, if he lost his spot and had nowhere to hide, he’d be dead for sure.

So even though he was angry, he was helpless.

The skinny man at the entrance sneered, “If you’re weak, you shouldn’t try to enter the Ancient Land. Since you’re here, you should be ready to die at any time. Get out!”

“I won’t go! If I go out, I’ll die for sure. Don’t push me! If you force me, I—I’ll self-destruct right here and make sure none of you have it easy!”

At these words, many people’s faces darkened, clearly displeased. But those with higher cultivation didn’t care—after all, he was at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Even if he wanted to self-destruct, he would need the chance to do so.

Of the dozen or so people present, at least half could subdue him before he tried.

“Hahaha!” The man at the entrance laughed loudly, looking at the young man mockingly, “If you want to self-destruct, go ahead! Let’s see if you can even manage it!”

He looked completely fearless, which made the young man panic. His threat failed, so he could only look around pleadingly, begging, “Please, sirs, help me! I don’t want to go out and die. Please, have some mercy and say a fair word for me!”

As he spoke, he cupped his fists repeatedly, almost kneeling in supplication.

But he was a stranger to everyone here. Who would stick their neck out for him at a time like this? So no one paid him any mind.

Zhang Ruoxi looked sympathetic, but after glancing at Yang Kai and seeing he didn’t react, she could only grit her teeth and stay silent.

The man at the entrance grew impatient, shouting, “You had your chance and didn’t take it. Now don’t blame me for using force!”

As he finished speaking, he reached out to grab the young man.

The cave was cramped and crowded, but this man had the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, so his move was precise, not touching anyone else. Clearly, he just wanted to drag the young man out and free up a spot.

The young man was dumbfounded. Facing an attack from a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert, he had no way to defend himself. He didn’t even have the courage to self-destruct as he’d threatened—he just stood there, dazed, waiting for disaster to strike.

Just then, a faint light flashed, Origin Qi burst forth, and with a soft pop, the man at the entrance suddenly staggered back a few steps.

Once he steadied himself, he flew into a rage, shouting, “Who! Who’s meddling in my business?!”

Clearly, someone had intervened to stop his attack, and that person’s cultivation wasn’t low, or he wouldn’t have suffered such a setback.

His gaze swept around and quickly locked onto Zhang Ruoxi, his expression changing as he gritted his teeth, “It was you!”

“That’s right, it was me!” Zhang Ruoxi admitted without hesitation.

The man’s face turned ugly, his eyes gloomy as he stared at Zhang Ruoxi.

If it were just Zhang Ruoxi, he wouldn’t be too wary, but the key was that Yang Kai was clearly with her. If he fought Zhang Ruoxi, Yang Kai would definitely step in. Facing two at once, he’d be in trouble.

So after a moment’s thought, he cupped his fists, “Miss, the howling wind is about to hit. I just want a place to take shelter, nothing more. If you could make an exception, I’d be deeply grateful. But if you insist on meddling, then I’ll have to see what you can do. Even a rabbit will bite if pushed.”

Though he was speaking to Zhang Ruoxi, he kept watching Yang Kai’s expression.

To his disappointment, Yang Kai just sat there, unmoved, as if this had nothing to do with him. He really couldn’t figure out whether Zhang Ruoxi and Yang Kai were together or not.

“It’s fine for you to look for a place to shelter, but there’s a first come, first served rule. There’s no spot left here, so how can you drive someone out? Is your life the only one that matters? Don’t the others’ lives count?” Zhang Ruoxi glared at him, cheeks puffed in anger. The Zhang Family had been bullied before because they were weak, so she couldn’t stand this kind of bullying. She’d held back for a while, but in the end, she couldn’t help stepping in.
