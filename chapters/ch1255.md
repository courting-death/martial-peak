## Chapter 1255 — Causing Trouble

Yang Kai looked up and found the defenses here far tighter than the main hall in Tianyun City where the Space Array was located; outside the hall stood seven or eight Demon Blood Sect disciples clad in cyan breastplates like javelins, each possessing cultivation around the Second or Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and within the hall there circulated the auras of several Origin Returning Realm experts.

"Brother Yang, please wait a moment. I will go in and notify them; once everything is arranged, I will escort you in," Deng Ning said politely.

Yang Kai nodded, then, under the watchful eyes of those Demon Blood Sect disciples, strode straight into the hall.

The seven or eight Demon Blood Sect guards seemed curious about the relationship between Deng Ning and Yang Kai; after Deng Ning went inside they kept glancing at Yang Kai, wondering about his identity.

But they did no more than stare; none of them had any intention of stepping forward to interrogate him.

After roughly half an hour, Deng Ning’s figure finally emerged from the hall, but his face bore an expression of deep pain, his features tightly drawn.

Seeing that, Yang Kai immediately knew his earlier suspicion was correct: securing permission to use a sect’s Space Array was not a trivial matter, and Deng Ning had obviously paid a heavy price.

The man’s earnest effort made Yang Kai feel a little embarrassed; after all, half a day ago he had still been considering whether to kill this man to silence him, yet now Deng Ning had gone so far to ensure he could use the Space Array — perhaps this man from the Demon Blood Sect might be worth befriending.

Yang Kai thought to himself.

Once Deng Ning emerged from the hall his expression returned to normal. He gave Yang Kai a chuckling smile and said, "Sorry to have kept you waiting, Brother Yang. Please come with me; everything has been settled."

"Very well!" Yang Kai nodded warmly; this time his attitude was genuinely friendlier. Having been shown kindness, he would naturally return it, and he resolved that if he ran into Deng Ning again he would lend a hand when he could.

Led by Deng Ning, the two entered the inner hall without obstruction. Inside stood a Space Array nearly identical to the one in Tianyun City. The array’s base was set with several grooves inlaid with Upper-Level Saint Crystals, ready to be activated — indeed, all had been prepared.

At least three Origin Returning Realm experts were stationed within the hall, and a dozen or so Saint King Realm disciples lined the sides. Of the three Origin Returning Realm experts, each looked formidable. Two sat on either side of the hall with eyes closed, meditating, ignoring Yang Kai and Deng Ning’s arrival.

The remaining man, an older fellow with a ruddy face and silver hair, stood by the array; his hawk-like eyes swept over Yang Kai once, then he said to Deng Ning, "Junior Nephew, is this the person you wish to vouch for?"

"Yes, Senior Uncle Liu, this is a friend this Junior once made," Deng Ning replied hurriedly and respectfully.

"A friend... heh heh!" Senior Uncle Liu forced a smile that did not reach his eyes, as if the word 'friend' had struck some nerve. "From Yingyue Hall?"

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent. Knowing Senior Uncle Liu had probably pried into his background via Deng Ning, he did not deny it. He cupped his fist and said, "Greetings, Elder Liu."

Seeing that Yang Kai at least knew proper manners, the Liu-surnamed elder gave a slight nod and said, “Though my Demon Blood Sect has little contact with Yingyue Hall, since Nephew Deng is willing to vouch for you, there’s no harm in letting you use our sect’s Space Array. However, Nephew, to guarantee this man’s passage to Qingshi City you’ve paid thirty contribution points to the sect—is that really worth it? You should know that earning those thirty points might take several life-and-death trials.”

Deng Ning’s face flickered; he glanced at Yang Kai and, seeing no reaction, forced a smile and said, "Senior Uncle Liu judges well, but Brother Yang once saved my life, so thirty points of contribution are nothing."

"Saved your life?" Senior Uncle Liu’s eyes flashed, suddenly turning cold as he barked, "A Second Stage of the Saint King Realm saved your life? Is your Third Stage of the Saint King Realm fake?"

Deng Ning went pale, sweat beaded on his brow, and he stood there meekly without daring to answer.

"And from what I know, you’ve had no opportunity to make friends in Yingyue Hall, except that one time at the Tianyun City auction. Heh heh, is it about that incident?" Senior Uncle Liu asked in a suspicious tone, firing off several questions.

For a time Deng Ning did not know how to reply.

Seeing how embarrassed Deng Ning had become under his sect uncle’s questioning, Yang Kai felt it inappropriate not to speak up for him. He said, “Elder, please see clearly—Brother Deng and I did not meet in Tianyun City, but within the Flowing Flame Sandland. It was merely by coincidence that I happened to save him once; it had nothing to do with strength. As for Brother Deng’s abilities, this Junior holds them in great esteem.”

"Flowing Flame Sandland! You went into Flowing Flame Sandland too? Why didn’t you return with Qian Tong and the others, but stayed behind?" Senior Uncle Liu asked, astonished.

"I had certain reasons and couldn’t return with Elder Qian and the others," Yang Kai replied lightly.

Senior Uncle Liu gave a meaning-laden smile and hinted, "It seems you must have gained quite a lot in Flowing Flame Sandland."

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly. Though alert, he showed no sign of panic. After a moment’s thought, he said, “I did gain a few things, but I’m afraid they wouldn’t be worthy of Elder’s attention.”

As he spoke he palmed five pigeon-egg-sized Crystal Stones into being, then, without making a show of it, handed them toward Elder Liu: "This is my first meeting with you, so I came empty-handed; please accept these small things."

At the sight of the Crystal Stones Senior Uncle Liu’s eyes lit up; he thought Yang Kai understood the game — the man’s interrogation was meant to extract benefits, and this young man had responded perfectly. In an instant the sternness left his face and a genial smile appeared. With a flourish of his sleeve the five Crystal Stones vanished and he said with approval, "Hm, not bad. No wonder my junior nephew befriended you; you are generous — likely to become a great man. Very well; since you are from Yingyue Hall, I will not press the matter further. My previous questions were only to guard against spies who might sneak in under false pretenses. You may go."

After pocketing the Crystal Stones he seemed to have turned into a different person.

"Thank you, Elder!" Yang Kai cupped his fist slightly.

On the other side, seeing the Liu-surnamed elder finally agree to let them pass, Deng Ning let out a quiet sigh of relief and cautiously reminded, “Senior Uncle Liu, shouldn’t we give Brother Yang a temporary token? Otherwise, when he reaches Qingshi City, the disciples of the Li Huo Sect might refuse to let him through.”

"Is that something you need to remind me of?" Senior Uncle Liu snorted, waved his hand, and a crimson token flew toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai caught it and saw a grotesque, snarling daemon face engraved on the token, fierce and terrifying.

Senior Uncle Liu explained, "This is a temporary token of the Demon Blood Sect. It will guarantee that after you pass through the Space Array the Li Huo Sect will not detain you. Of course, this temporary token is valid for three days only; within those three days you may use either their Space Array or ours — it will be sufficient for your needs."

"Understood," Yang Kai nodded gently.

"Step onto the array; I will activate it." Senior Uncle Liu gestured, and Yang Kai’s form flickered as he stepped to the center of the formation.

Deng Ning stood at his side and, smiling with cupped fists, said, "Safe travels, Brother Yang. If you ever come to Demon Blood City again, remember to find Deng Ning and let me treat you to a drink."

"All right. If Deng Brother ever comes to Tianyun City, come see me and I will give you a warm reception," Yang Kai replied.

Deng Ning brightened to hear this; he felt his sacrifice had not been in vain. Thirty contribution points had stung, but if he truly gained a friend like this, the cost was worth it — one never knew when one might need help.

As they spoke, the Space Array emitted blinding light and the surrounding spatial forces twisted.

White light filled Yang Kai’s vision; after a brief daze he found himself in another heavily guarded hall.

In an instant several powerful Divine Senses pressed down; robes fluttered as a number of Saint King Realm warriors surrounded Yang Kai, watching him warily.

Yang Kai showed no sign of panic; he tossed the Demon Blood Sect temporary token toward one Origin Returning Realm expert who looked the most imposing, and remained standing where he was.

The Origin Returning Realm expert examined the token, frowned, and said, "From the Demon Blood Sect!"

Then he tossed the token back and remarked coldly, "This token is valid for three days. If you do not reach here within three days, the Space Array will not admit you."

"I understand," Yang Kai nodded.

The Origin Returning Realm expert waved his hand and all hostility vanished; the Li Huo Sect disciples resumed their duties and returned to their stations, and for a while no one paid Yang Kai any heed.

Yang Kai was pleased enough. Once out of the hall he drifted into the throng of Qingshi City.

He had no intention of lingering; an hour later a streak of azure light shot up from outside Qingshi City and vanished into the sky.

Yang Kai also asked around for the route from Qingshi City to Tianyun City; since he knew few people in the Li Huo Sect there was no one to vouch for him to use their Space Array.

Fortunately the distance to Tianyun City was only a month’s travel from here, far closer than from Demon Blood City; he could afford to spend that time.

The Star Shuttle moved swiftly. Yang Kai sat cross-legged atop it, diverting a portion of his spirit to steer while he examined his spoils from the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Since entering the Flowing Flame Sandland he had encountered one fortunate opportunity after another; this trip had indeed yielded many valuable items, but how best to make use of them required careful thought.

As he checked over his gains from the Flowing Flame Sandland Yang Kai’s emotions rose and fell; he felt secretly astonished at what he had obtained.

After finishing his inspection of the spoils from Flowing Flame Sandland, Yang Kai finally began to examine the Blood Fusion Pill closely.
