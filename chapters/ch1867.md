## Chapter 1867 — Treasure Vault

Half a month passed in a blink, and it was the day of Purple Star’s ancestral and heavenly rites.

Every year on this day the Purple Star high council, led by the Master of Purple Star, would troop out in groups to pay respects to their ancestors, to soothe the spirits of those who had gone before.

Inside the Purple Star Palace there was a vast ancestral hall; enshrined there were not only the forebears of the Zi family but also countless outsiders who had made enormous contributions to Purple Star's development, and the memorial tablets of successive elders were all placed there.

This was a great affair for Purple Star, and no one dared treat it casually.

The Purple Star leadership had prepared for it for a long time, attending thoroughly to every detail.

All Purple Star’s upper echelon would arrive at Purple Star Palace on this day without fail, gathering toward the ancestral hall.

Almost every gaze and every bit of attention was fixed on the hall; other defenses had been neglected considerably.

Yang Kai also arrived at the Purple Star Palace at that moment.

At the palace gate, after he presented the Command Token, a guard respectfully ushered him inside.

They hadn't gone far when someone suddenly appeared ahead and called to the guard, "You may leave; I will take responsibility from here."

"Yes." The guard bowed and hurried away.

Yang Kai looked at the man and cupped his fists slightly. "Elder Ji!"

The man was none other than Ji Jun, who had long followed Zi Wuji.

Ji Jun smiled faintly and returned the salute. "Ji Jun greets Venerable Yang. Please, follow me—Second Young Master has arranged everything and now awaits your arrival."

"Much obliged." Yang Kai nodded lightly and followed Ji Jun inward.

Ji Jun was undoubtedly very familiar with the Purple Star Palace. Leading Yang Kai by many turns and passages, it only took them half an hour to arrive before a secret hall at the very center; the hall was fashioned from some unknown material, its perimeters riddled with seals and its defenses strict.

Yet at that moment it was empty; the warriors that would normally guard it had evidently all been withdrawn.

Ji Jun stood before the secret hall, his eyes betraying uncontrollable fervor; he took a deep breath to steady himself and said, "Venerable Yang, Second Young Master said this is where Purple Star's Treasure Vault lies. It can be opened only with a special key and a drop of blood from a direct descendant of the Zi family—one drop of Essence-Blood."

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed. "It requires a drop of a Zi family direct descendant's Essence-Blood? Why was I never told of this?"

Neither Zi Donglai nor Zi Wuji had told him this secret. Zi Wuji had kept things from him; Yang Kai could understand that to a degree—after all, they were not yet close enough for full frankness, despite their agreement.

But Zi Donglai had also withheld it, and that made Yang Kai very angry.

Ji Jun chuckled. "Venerable One, calm yourself. It's not a big matter—Young Master Wuji has already prepared a drop of his own Essence-Blood for you."

As he spoke he produced a transparent vial in which a crimson bead of blood rested; within that bead there shimmered traces of purple radiance as if some mysterious power were being nurtured—different from ordinary blood—and it rolled ceaselessly at the bottom of the bottle.

Yang Kai reached out; before Ji Jun could react, Yang Kai snatched that drop of Essence-Blood into his palm, and Ji Jun's face went pale.

Ji Jun was at least of the First Stage of the Void King Realm, yet he had no time to react when Yang Kai took what was in his hand, which showed how vast the disparity in their strength truly was.

"Venerable One..." Ji Jun looked at the drop of Essence-Blood with pleading eyes, his voice faltering.

"Tell me how to use it, Elder Ji." Yang Kai ordered calmly, his tone brooking no argument.

Ji Jun's face fell, but he dared not defy him. "You only need to smear this Essence-Blood on the key."

Yang Kai nodded in understanding, flicked open the vial, and with Saint Yuan surging, the drop of Essence-Blood shot from the jade bottle and splashed onto the key he had taken out.

The golden key seemed to come alive, greedily devouring Zi Wuji's Essence-Blood; Yang Kai even heard a sucking sound, and in the next instant the key transformed into a twin-horned Jiao, its small body flowing with a faint purple nimbus; it flew two circles in the air and then plunged toward the secret hall's door.

The hefty door shivered as though it had become invisible, sending ripples through the air.

"Elder Ji, wait a moment here; I will be right back." Yang Kai left the words hanging, flashed his body, and slipped into the secret hall.

"Wait!" Ji Jun, remembering Zi Wuji's instructions, dared not let Yang Kai go alone and was about to follow when the hall's door suddenly returned to normal.

Ji Jun nearly ran into it.

"This is bad, this is bad!" Ji Jun stamped his feet anxiously, cursing Yang Kai soundly in his heart.

This place had been Purple Star's Treasure Vault for countless years; although it did not store large quantities, every single item was extraordinarily precious—many were the bedrock of Purple Star's standing—and Yang Kai had gone in alone; who knew whether he would keep his promise and take only one item?

Because of such concerns Zi Wuji had asked Ji Jun to accompany Yang Kai: first to prevent Yang Kai from becoming greedy, and second to see what Yang Kai intended to take.

But no one had expected Yang Kai's movements to be so swift that even a First Stage of the Void King Realm like Ji Jun could not guard against them.

Wiping the cold sweat from his brow, Ji Jun looked dejected, racking his brains about how he would report this to Zi Wuji later, while inwardly praying that Yang Kai would not be too covetous and would grab only a little.

Inside the hall Yang Kai glanced left and right and found the place did not occupy a large area and did not contain many items, but what he did see made his eyes brighten.

Even with his breadth of experience, stepping into Purple Star’s Treasure Vault still left him feeling a jolt of awe.

There were no Saint Crystals here, but there were jade flasks of every size, various Secret Treasures, and volume after volume of cultivation manuals and arcane techniques...

Without needing to search carefully, Yang Kai knew that none of these items were anything but treasures.

Yang Kai stood and let out a feral chuckle, then produced a Soul-Fixing Bowl in his palm; his gaze turned sharp as a thought surged into the bowl.

In the next moment a scream came from the bowl as Zi Donglai's soul-body appeared, trembling and calling in fear, "Master, what has happened?"

Yang Kai stared at him with a sinister look, baring a row of white fangs, and grinned. "Zi Donglai, have a look—what place is this?"

Zi Donglai turned and looked around; his face changed drastically and he stammered, "The Purple Star Treasure Vault—how could you..."

Before he finished, he realized and quickly forced a smile. "Congratulations, Master, this is indeed my Purple Star Treasure Vault, hehe..."

"Don't play dumb with me!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "Entering this Treasure Vault required a Zi family direct descendant's Essence-Blood—why did you never tell me this?"

"Master, please spare me, spare me. I intended to tell you when you were more prepared, but I never had the chance. It was not my intention to hide it from you."

“Spare me the slick excuses,” Yang Kai sneered coldly. “You think I don’t see through your scheming? Weren’t you planning to use my hand to get rid of your Second Brother, Zi Wuji, and take his Essence-Blood for yourself?”

Zi Donglai's face flickered and he was left speechless.

Yang Kai had evidently struck the truth.

"Zi Donglai, you thought you were clever, but your cleverness only brought you harm," Yang Kai chuckled lowly.

"Master, forgive me, please! I will never dare again!" Zi Donglai's soul curled in the Soul-Fixing Bowl, kowtowing and begging for mercy.

"Now you beg for mercy? Where were you earlier?" Yang Kai snorted and flicked his finger at Zi Donglai's soul.

At a point from his finger, Zi Donglai's soul-body seemed to be grievously struck; as though a mist had been blown apart, it could no longer cohere, and his terrified cry weakened until it dissolved into nothingness in the world.

Yang Kai felt no burden in extinguishing Zi Donglai; the man had repeatedly made trouble for him in the Lost Realm and had even egged Xu Wei on to attempt to kill him. If not for some earlier usefulness, Yang Kai would not have kept the Soul-Fixing Bowl with him.

Now that he learned this man had concealed things from him, Yang Kai would not allow him to live.

After extinguishing Zi Donglai's soul Yang Kai pocketed the Soul-Fixing Bowl; it was a strange Secret Treasure that might prove useful at some future time.

Only then did Yang Kai have time to examine the vault's stores.

He inspected bottle after bottle of pills and his eyes gleamed with delight.

There were only eight varieties of pills and fifty-two bottles in total stored in the vault, but each vial contained Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills! These pills would bring enormous advancement to anyone of the Void King Realm—truly Purple Star's treasured hoard accumulated over many years.

Yang Kai did not hesitate; he swept them all into his Spatial Ring.

He took the various Secret Treasures as well.

Of the Secret Treasures placed here five were of Void King-Grade quality, the finest being of Void King-Grade Middle-Level; the other four, even as Void King-Grade Lower-Level, were rare treasures.

The remainder were Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures.

These Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures were unlike ordinary Origin-Grade Upper-Level items; each possessed tremendous power—though not quite Void King-Grade, they were close.

He also took the cultivation manuals and arcane tomes Purple Star had collected over the years—now that Lingxiao Sect was vast and prosperous with more than ten thousand disciples, bringing these back would offer disciples far more choices.

Placed here in the Treasure Vault, these cultivation manuals and secret techniques could not possibly be inferior. Training with them would allow the disciples of Lingxiao Sect to start far ahead of others, and this advantage would only grow more pronounced as their strength increased, eventually leaving the rest of the cultivators far behind.

Besides these, there were many precious materials for pill and artifact refinement.

Yang Kai pocketed them all.

In an instant he had gained a great haul.

He felt not a shred of remorse; although he had told Zi Wuji he would take only one item, once inside the vault how much he took was not for Zi Wuji to control.

He had never had much goodwill toward Purple Star, so he acted ruthlessly now.
