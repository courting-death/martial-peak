## Chapter 49 — Victory Announced

Cheng Shaofeng was dead! Without any warning, he had fallen at Yang Kai’s hand.

During Yang Kai’s previous fierce battle against a group of disciples from Fengyu Tower, Hu Mei’er had witnessed the entire fight. Though she knew Yang Kai’s strength was extraordinary, she had never imagined it to be this overwhelming!

Cheng Shaofeng, a First Stage Open Origin Realm cultivator, had only exchanged a glance with Yang Kai before being struck down by a single finger!

What kind of martial technique was that? How could it possess such devastating power? The hole burned into Cheng Shaofeng’s forehead was clearly scorched by something supremely firm and blazing with intense Yang energy.

At that moment, Hu Mei’er’s heart filled with dread. Witnessing Yang Kai’s thunderous and lethal method, she finally understood that his earlier words were no idle boast.

He truly dared to kill—and had the power to do so!

Nu Tao was equally shocked. He had only exchanged a single punch with Yang Kai; before he could even launch his second move, his junior brother lay dead before him. This sudden turn of events left him utterly dumbfounded.

“You actually killed Junior Brother Cheng!” Nu Tao screamed hoarsely. “What technique did you use?”

The power behind that finger strike was far beyond ordinary—it had to be some extraordinary martial art. Nu Tao’s heart trembled with fear, uncertain if he could withstand it.

“You will die as well!” Yang Kai, fully aware of the principle of eradicating all threats, knew these two had come with the intent to kill him. Faced with such enemies, he would show no mercy.

This time was different from before. Previously, it had been a mere brawl, and Yang Kai had held back. But when one’s life is at stake, sparing an enemy is sheer folly.

Seeing Yang Kai rush toward him in haste, Nu Tao suddenly sneered, “Stop bluffing! Come and die!”

Shouting, he unleashed a double fist strike, meeting Yang Kai head-on. After all, Yang Kai was only a Body Tempering Realm cultivator; how much Primordial Qi could he possibly have? That devastating move earlier must have consumed a great deal of energy, meaning he could not repeat such a technique.

Thus, Nu Tao was emboldened.

Yet, upon engaging, Nu Tao realized his grave mistake. Yang Kai was still able to wield Primordial Qi. Each clash radiated a scorching heat from his strikes, forcing Nu Tao to suffer blow after blow. Though Nu Tao’s realm was higher, he could not suppress Yang Kai.

Nu Tao unleashed all his skills, dodging and weaving, unwilling to face Yang Kai directly. His plan was to wear him down, to exhaust Yang Kai’s Primordial Qi. Once that was done, Yang Kai would be as helpless as fish on a chopping block.

This strategy was sound against ordinary Body Tempering Realm disciples. It was the most efficient way to defeat an enemy with minimal cost. But Yang Kai was different. Having just absorbed all the Yang Flame energy from a Yang Flame Stone, his meridians brimmed with energy. If the battle continued, it might be Nu Tao who would tire first.

Soon, Nu Tao sensed something was amiss.

At first, Yang Kai had seemed like a typical Body Tempering Realm fighter. His punches were faster and stronger than average but still within the expected limits. Yet as time passed, and after leaving numerous wounds on Yang Kai, his strength only grew. Each punch came faster and hit harder. Most troubling was the fiery energy accompanying his strikes, which grew ever more potent.

It was as if Yang Kai’s power was increasing with time.

How could this be? A cultivator’s strength normally wanes as their energy depletes. Why was Yang Kai’s the opposite?

Within the span of a single tea break, Nu Tao could no longer evade Yang Kai’s attacks. A single misstep saw a heavy punch slam into his chest.

The crushing force nearly stole his breath, and the fiery energy invading his body burned fiercely like a raging fire.

Seeing Yang Kai’s eyes blazing red, Nu Tao’s heart wavered with the thought of retreat.

Feigning a move, Nu Tao suddenly withdrew, speeding away into the distance. Gasping for breath, he shouted, “Yang Kai, you killed Junior Brother Cheng! You’re dead!”

Though Nu Tao was a Fifth Stage Open Origin Realm cultivator and could not defeat Yang Kai, he was confident he could escape. From their fight, he had noticed Yang Kai had not cultivated any body movement techniques.

If Nu Tao fled, Yang Kai could do nothing but watch him disappear dozens of zhang away.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s mind stirred. The last drop of Yang liquid in his dantian flickered to his fingertip.

Then, with a pull of his other hand, a shocking scene unfolded.

That single drop of Yang liquid instantly transformed into a blood-red blade, thin as a cicada’s wing. As soon as it formed, Yang Kai sent it flying.

With a sharp whistle, a streak of bloody light sliced through the air, embedding itself in Nu Tao’s back.

Nu Tao’s fleeing body stiffened instantly, collapsing to the ground with a thud.

The forest fell silent, save for the occasional chirp of insects and birds. Yang Kai panted heavily, his body battered and disheveled.

Hu Mei’er’s legs trembled, her body chilled to the bone, a cold dread gnawing at her heart. She had stayed nearby, hoping Yang Kai would call for help when he could no longer hold on, so she could seize her chance.

But what she never expected was that the two Fengyu Tower disciples who came to assassinate Yang Kai would instead be slain by him.

Both were Open Origin Realm cultivators—one First Stage, the other Fifth Stage—who had joined forces against a mere Body Tempering Realm Yang Kai, only to fail and lose their lives.

Everything felt unreal, inexplicable.

Suddenly, Hu Mei’er’s expression changed sharply. She noticed Yang Kai turning his head, fixing her with a gaze as if he were about to devour her. His eyes gleamed with the murderous intent of silencing a witness.

Instinctively, Hu Mei’er stepped back a few paces.

“Dare to move, and you die!” Yang Kai’s cold voice rang out.

“I won’t move…” Hu Mei’er’s voice quivered with tears, a warm spasm gripping her abdomen, nearly causing her to lose composure.

She was truly terrified and uncertain whether Yang Kai intended to kill her. Life and death hung in the balance. What could a young girl do? Though successful in love, her strength was truly lacking.

Yang Kai ignored her and moved to search Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao’s bodies thoroughly. In no time, he found some silver coins and two bottles of pills.

Though the pills were nearly depleted, they still held some value.

Not a bad haul! It was just a pity that his refined Yang liquid was now gone, leaving his dantian empty. After the fierce battle, most of the True Yang Yuan Qi in his meridians had been expended.

“Are you short on money?” Hu Mei’er dared to speak, emboldened by Yang Kai’s pill search. “I can give you some, just don’t kill me.”

Now, she no longer dared to flaunt herself or act coquettishly before Yang Kai. Even her words were cautious.

Yang Kai glanced at her indifferently. “I’m no bandit. Why would I want your money? If I need money, I’ll earn it myself.”
