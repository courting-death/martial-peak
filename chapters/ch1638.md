## Chapter 1638 — Think For Yourself 

On the outer isle there stood a pavilion beside the great sea, jade waters and the sound of the tide all around.

After Yu Xueqing had settled Yang Kai in the pavilion and gone off with the others, a disciple of Ice Heart Valley of modest strength came to tend to Yang Kai's daily needs.

Before leaving, Qing Ya cast Yang Kai a look urging him to remain calm.

Yang Kai took the hint.

Now that he had arrived at Icebound Island and learned that Su Yan was only a few hundred li away, the longing to see his beloved again surged within him more fiercely than ever before. Yet he also knew that Icebound Island was no ordinary place, and thus he would not recklessly barge in.

Sitting cross-legged in the pavilion, Yang Kai held Su Yan's Ice Soul Pearl in his hand, motionless.

He did not release his Divine Sense, yet he could clearly feel that, a few hundred li away, there was an aura intimately related to him, sharing joys and sorrows.

It was Su Yan's aura.

At the same time, Su Yan sat upright in her ice chamber, her beautiful eyes closed, long lashes trembling slightly.

Both were sensing each other's presence, feeling the rise and fall of one another's emotions.

This silent, formless telepathic communion carried a power greater than words; both their bodies and minds felt warmed.

At a certain moment they smiled at the same time, and a wondrous psychic force burst from their bodies, crossing the barriers of time and space to meet at the heart of Icebound Island.

Yang Kai seemed to see Su Yan vividly standing before him; the figure that had dwelt in his heart for over thirty years finally reappeared now.

He could even feel Su Yan reaching out to touch him.

He responded.

Their mental link grew ever closer, gradually melding into one.

There were no spoken words, yet each could clearly perceive everything about the other, everything the other had endured over the years, as if personally lived.

At a location on the inner island, in Ran Yunting's ice chamber, the meditating Ran Yunting suddenly frowned as if sensing something; she looked up into the void, a puzzled expression on her face.

At that moment the Transmission Compass at her side pulsed with Divine Sense. She picked up the Transmission Compass and poured Divine Sense into it; upon detecting the message within her face darkened: "Junior Sister Yu actually found that brat, and even brought him to Icebound Island? So that's it. That little beast is the one disturbing Su Yan's mind!"

"That little beast is courting death!"

A murderous light flashed in Ran Yunting's eyes. A domineering soul-force suddenly sprayed into the void and slammed toward a certain point on Icebound Island.

Yang Kai, in the midst of mental communion with Su Yan, had no expectation of being attacked.

Mental communion is different from Divine Sense power. The former has no offensive or defensive capability, whereas the latter can attack and defend.

The instant Ran Yunting unleashed her power, Yang Kai felt their telepathic link be rudely severed. Worse still, the mental shock drained his face pale and he nearly spat blood.

"Who is it!" Yang Kai’s eyes snapped open, his expression turning exceedingly grim.

He could sense that the force which cut off his link with Su Yan contained killing intent and cared nothing for his life; if not for his superior Divine Sense, that single strike would have grievously wounded him.

Such an injury was to the Divine Sense itself, not something ordinary Spiritual Pills could mend.

A chill flashed through Yang Kai's eyes, but soon he helplessly shook his head.

What he had done before had indeed been somewhat abrupt; after all this was Icebound Island, the main headquarters of Ice Heart Valley. For ten thousand years he was the first man to set foot on the outer isle, and to have acted so rashly was indeed improper.

Having thought it through, Yang Kai calmed himself and ceased to dwell on it.

However, that Divine Sense power was extraordinary; it was very likely from one of Ice Heart Valley's top five elders.

Having taken that bitter loss, he would not act rashly; there would be other chances to meet Su Yan. As for Su Yan's safety, Yang Kai was not worried—after all she was the disciple of Ice Heart Valley's Great Elder, and whichever elder interfered would not strike hard against her.

In Su Yan's ice chamber she suddenly opened her eyes, pale-faced, whispering, "Master!"

“Reflect on your mistakes behind closed doors. If you dare act as you just did again, before anyone else even needs to lift a hand, I will personally take that little beast’s head myself!” Ran Yunting’s icy voice sounded beside Su Yan’s ear.

Su Yan's face paled further; she opened her mouth as if to speak, but nothing came out.

“You’d best think for yourself from now on.” Ran Yunting seemed deeply disappointed in Su Yan as she left those cold words behind, then fell silent.

In Ice Heart Valley's Council Ice Palace, after a year, the valley's high-ranking members gathered together once more.

"Valley Lord, have you summoned us sisters for important business?" an elder asked.

Bing Long smiled gently and nodded. "There is one matter, though it is a joyous one."

"Oh? What joyous matter?" the others asked with curiosity.

"Elder Yu has already found that youth, and has even brought him to Icebound Island," Bing Long announced bluntly with a smile.

"Found him?"

"Junior Sister Yu is indeed resourceful—finding him like this merits great credit!"

"Good, good! It's been over a year; the valley has lost many disciples—it's time to withdraw."

"But Valley Lord, have you learned why the Fire Radiance Sect is searching for him? What secret does he hide that warrants Fire Radiance's attention?"

"That... I do not know either. Elder Yu, you brought him back—did you discover anything?" Bing Long turned her gaze to Yu Xueqing.

Yu shook her head slowly. "On the way back I probed indirectly once, but that boy did not answer. From my observation, he is no ordinary man."

"Why do you say that?"

"He... he should be a genius among geniuses; Yan Chilei of the Fire Radiance Sect died at his hands."

"What? Yan Chilei died at his hands?" Bing Long's expression changed and she frowned. "Wasn't it said this man only had cultivation at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm?"

"Indeed, he is only at the Second Stage, yet he can fight beyond his rank—this is why I call him a genius among geniuses."

"Not bad indeed!" Bing Long nodded.

"Jiang Xi also died at his hands," Yu Xueqing said with a strange expression. "One-on-one, he killed him in twenty breaths!"

"Jiang Xi? That Jiang Xi?" The Fifth Elder's phoenix-like eyes narrowed, incredulity on her face.

"Exactly that Jiang Xi."

"How is that possible?"

"Although Jiang Xi did not come from any illustrious sect and has always been solitary, he experienced numerous odd encounters when young; his strength is exceptional, not an ordinary Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—rumor has it his Shi is near perfection."

"He was one of the more promising candidates on Chi Lan Star to ascend to the Void King Realm—how could he be slain by that youth? Junior Sister Yu, you aren't joking?"

"How could I joke about such a matter? Junior Sisters, I saw it with my own eyes, and a dozen or so disciples can attest to it," Yu Xueqing said with a solemn face.

The Ice Heart Valley elders looked at one another in horror; several turned to the Fifth Elder to hear her view.

Among those present, only the Fifth Elder had once fought Jiang Xi, so her words carried weight.

The Fifth Elder did not shirk; after a moment's thought she said, "The last time I battled Jiang Xi was twenty years ago. I spent an entire day wounding him grievously, yet I could not kill him. If it were him now, I might not be a match. In Ice Heart Valley, the number of elders who could single-handedly contend with Jiang Xi would not exceed three!"

Gasp...

A sharp hiss of cold breath echoed through the hall, and the Elders’ expressions were utterly vivid—each filled with astonishment and disbelief.

The Fifth Elder had not exaggerated—she simply spoke factually, and it was precisely for that reason that it felt terrifying.

"Doesn't this imply that the youth's personal strength ranks among the top three of us?"

"He is only at the Second Stage—if he were to ascend to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm..."

"Not only that! Standing even and killing are different; he was able to kill Jiang Xi, and did so in only twenty breaths. Only the Great Elder might be able to contend with such power!"

The faces of the assembled Elders suddenly dimmed. Even they felt uncertain at those words—for even if the Great Elder herself had taken action, she might not have been able to claim Jiang Xi’s life within merely twenty breaths of time.

They exchanged glances, and what remained on their faces was shock.

"What a pity he's not a woman," Bing Long said, rubbing her brow and smiling ruefully.

If Yang Kai were a woman, Bing Long would spare no effort to bring him into Ice Heart Valley; such a talent would have far greater chances of ascending to the Void King Realm than other Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

Ice Heart Valley became one of the two great forces on Chi Lan Star because it had a Void King Realm stronghold; if it could add another, it could completely suppress the Fire Radiance Sect, tower above it, and become the foremost sect on Chi Lan Star, dominating utterly.

"What does it matter that he's not a woman? Our Ice Heart Valley disciples do marry—find a suitable disciple and marry her to him," an elder suggested with a smile.

"That's not a bad idea, but he may not agree," another elder beside her slowly shook his head. "With such talent and apparent youth, how could he lack women? There may be many willing to follow him."

"Those ordinary floozies cannot compare to Ice Heart Valley's elite disciples; if he can take one of our elite disciples as his wife, it would be his good fortune."

"That's not a bad point."

The elders chattered away, each voicing their opinion, as if eager to find a suitable candidate to marry Yang Kai now and bind him to Ice Heart Valley's great ship.

Bing Long cleared her throat, a strange expression on her face. "Have you forgotten that the Fire Radiance Sect is also searching for him? A single Fire Radiance Sect we might not fear, but this matter could very well involve Lord Luo Hai of Cuiwei Star... should we displease that lord, Ice Heart Valley may not be able to bear his wrath."

The elders' expressions all changed, and they fell silent.
