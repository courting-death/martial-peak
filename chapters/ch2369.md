## Chapter 2369 — Ruoxi Is About to Break Through

Jiao Yi did his best to persuade them, "We only discovered the area with the Cangyu Coral by accident five years ago. At that time, a sea beast was guarding it, so we never managed to get it. But according to Big Sister’s observation, that sea beast’s lifespan was almost up. Five years have passed, so it must be dead by now. In other words, the Cangyu Coral can be harvested freely. After this trip, we won’t need to go out to sea for at least a year."

Yang Kai slowly shook his head and said, "My Junior Sister and I won’t be joining in."

He didn’t lack Source Crystals at all, so he had no interest in mining Cangyu Coral, no matter how much Jiao Yi tried to entice him.

Seeing this, Jiao Yi didn’t press further. He just thought that Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun would need to live here a few more years to understand the value of Cangyu Coral. By then, he probably wouldn’t need to persuade them; they’d join on their own.

"By the way, how long will it take for you to return from this trip?" Yang Kai asked.

Jiao Yi replied, "It’s about three days to the destination. Mining will take two or three days, and as for the return trip... it’ll take at least a month to get back to Tongtian Island."

"That long!" Yang Kai couldn’t help but frown.

Jiao Yi gave a wry smile and said, "The resources around Tongtian Island have pretty much been exhausted. If you want anything good, you have to venture farther out. Risk and reward always go hand in hand."

Yang Kai nodded, "Then I wish you all the best."

Hearing this, Jiao Yi sensibly stood up and said, "Then I won’t disturb your cultivation. If you need anything, just come find Old Jiao."

"Alright."

At the door, Jiao Yi suddenly said, "By the way, if you go to Tongtian City in the future, you must first find a way to get an identity plaque, or you won’t be able to enter the city. But getting an identity plaque will expose you as newcomers. Should I tell Big Sister to think of something for you? We don’t rely on any force, but Big Sister is well-connected. Maybe she can handle it."

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then nodded, "Thank you, Brother Jiao."

Jiao Yi smiled, "I’ll let you know if there’s any news."

After Jiao Yi left, Yang Kai exchanged glances with Liu Qianyun, both seeing the worry in each other’s eyes. Even those at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm could be trapped in this place, so it was clear their chances of leaving were slim. Jiao Yi’s group obviously didn’t know how to get out either, so there was no point asking them for information.

For now, they could only go to Tongtian Island and make plans from there.

After three to five days of travel, the ship suddenly stopped.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and found that all the martial artists on the ship were standing on the deck, eager and ready, as if they were preparing to dive for Cangyu Coral.

Yang Kai didn’t pay much attention, but Jiao Yi came over again to ask if he wanted to join them in diving.

After Yang Kai declined, Jiao Yi didn’t insist.

Soon, most people on the ship jumped off the deck and disappeared into the sea.

Just as Jiao Yi had said, in the depths of the sea, the powerful sea beast guarding the Cangyu Coral was already dead, so Ling Yinqin and the others had a smooth time collecting it.

Martial artists kept diving in and out of the sea, each one looking excited and energized.

Four days later, when all the martial artists returned from the sea, no one went back in.

Yang Kai didn’t pay close attention to their activities, but occasionally overheard their conversations. From their scattered chatter, he learned that they had indeed gained a huge harvest this time, even more than Ling Yinqin had expected.

There were no casualties among the crew. After just one trip out to sea, they had gained so much with no effort that everyone was smiling, even the usually cold Ling Yinqin showed a rare smile.

After waiting for half a day, the ship turned around and slowly set sail, apparently heading back.

Yang Kai finally relaxed. He had been worried that Ling Yinqin’s group might encounter danger at sea. If that happened, no one would take him to Tongtian Island.

Now that everything was safe, it was just as Yang Kai had hoped.

Life was uneventful. Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun stayed in their cabin and didn’t go out. Ling Yinqin seemed satisfied with their cooperation and honesty, so she didn’t bother them. Jiao Yi, on the other hand, occasionally brought them food and drink.

Seven days later, while meditating, Yang Kai suddenly sensed something and opened his eyes.

The next moment, he released his Divine Sense and entered the Xuan Realm Pearl to contact his Incarnation.

"What is it?" Yang Kai asked. His Incarnation had just sent him an urgent message, and he didn’t know what had happened.

"Ruoxi, that girl... is about to advance," the Incarnation replied immediately.

"Ruoxi is about to advance?" Yang Kai’s brows rose. "That’s good news."

"Good news, my ass!" the Incarnation shouted.

Yang Kai suddenly realized the seriousness of the situation, his expression changing. "Dao Origin Realm?"

He remembered that Zhang Ruoxi’s cultivation was at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. If she broke through again, she’d reach the Dao Origin Realm!

"Exactly. I don’t know what’s going on with that girl, but her strength is improving at a frightening pace. It hasn’t been that long, and she’s already about to break through to the Dao Origin Realm."

Yang Kai immediately understood how serious the problem was and hurriedly entered the Small Xuan Realm.

Somewhere in the Small Xuan Realm, Zhang Ruoxi sat cross-legged, her aura surging. The Saint Yuan in her body flowed like rivers, even making a murmuring sound.

Clearly, she was on the verge of a breakthrough.

If she were outside, breaking through wouldn’t be a problem. But here in the Small Xuan Realm, the laws of heaven and earth were incomplete. Normally, Zhang Ruoxi could cultivate here without issue, but breaking through to a higher realm required the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy and understanding of the laws, which the Small Xuan Realm couldn’t provide.

In other words, Zhang Ruoxi couldn’t break through to the Dao Origin Realm inside the Small Xuan Realm. If left alone, she would only fail.

If she failed, Zhang Ruoxi’s Martial Dao would end here, and she might even suffer backlash and die.

Yang Kai’s face turned ugly.

Outside was the vast sea, and the environment of the Jixu Secret Realm was so strange. He didn’t know if taking Zhang Ruoxi outside would allow her to break through.

Even if he took her outside, where could she break through?

Beside Zhang Ruoxi, Hua Qingsi and Liu Yan stood with serious expressions. Noticing his arrival, the two women hurried over.

"How long has this been going on?" Yang Kai asked.

"Just started," Hua Qingsi replied. "But judging by her state, she probably can’t suppress it. Forcing it down will only harm her foundation."

"Master, what should we do now?" Liu Yan was at a loss. She and Hua Qingsi knew Yang Kai’s situation, but couldn’t think of any way to solve Zhang Ruoxi’s predicament.

"Watch her for a while. I’ll think of something," Yang Kai said, then immediately left the Small Xuan Realm.

Zhang Ruoxi had just sensed the opportunity to break through and could probably hold on for a while, but not for long. He had to find a solution before time ran out.

Back in the cabin, Yang Kai reappeared and rushed out.

Liu Qianyun was confused, not knowing why Yang Kai was in such a hurry, but she quickly got up and followed him out.

In the cabin, Ling Yinqin was meditating and cultivating. The huge harvest from this trip had surprised her, and after returning, she wouldn’t need to go out for at least two or three years, so she was in a good mood.

Just as she was thinking about which force to sell the Cangyu Coral to after returning, the door was suddenly slammed open.

Ling Yinqin was startled and jumped up, shouting, "Who’s there!"

As the leader of the ship, Ling Yinqin had never encountered a crew member who would barge in without so much as a knock. Her first instinct was that they must be under attack.

But when she saw who had come in, Ling Yinqin gritted her teeth and said, "What are you doing!"

She was furious, secretly glad she hadn’t been comprehending any techniques or secret arts just now. Otherwise, Yang Kai’s interruption would have ruined everything.

Since coming aboard, this man had always behaved himself. Ling Yinqin had thought well of him, but now she found him extremely annoying.

Yang Kai knew he was being abrupt, but since Zhang Ruoxi’s life and future were at stake, he could only clasp his fists and say, "Big Sister Ling, I have an urgent matter. Please forgive me."

He had learned Ling Yinqin’s name from listening to the crew’s conversations.

"What’s going on?"

Exclamations came from the corridor. Clearly, Yang Kai’s commotion had attracted the crew.

Seeing Yang Kai at the door and Ling Yinqin furious, everyone was shocked. Jiao Yi blinked and said, "Brother Yang, why did you break into Big Sister’s room?"

"Is the kid after Big Sister’s beauty and wants to force himself on her?"

"What? Really? That’s terrible, just terrible."

"Kid, you’re courting death! You have a Junior Sister and still aren’t satisfied, now you’re after Big Sister? I’ll cripple you today!"

The crowd made a racket, and the scene became lively.

Yang Kai was speechless and quickly clasped his fists to Ling Yinqin, "I really have an urgent matter, Big Sister Ling, please forgive me."

Ling Yinqin glared at Yang Kai. Though she was still angry, seeing his expression didn’t seem fake, so she snorted, "What’s so urgent that you can’t even knock? Didn’t your elders teach you manners?"

Yang Kai was scolded and didn’t dare talk back. He could only say, "I wanted to ask Big Sister Ling, if someone needs to break through outside, what should they do?"

"Break through?" Ling Yinqin’s face changed. "Break through to a higher realm?"

"Exactly!" Yang Kai nodded.

Hearing this, Ling Yinqin’s mind went blank, her face full of shock.

She thought Yang Kai was about to break through.

Yang Kai was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. If he broke through, wouldn’t that mean he would advance to the Emperor Realm?
