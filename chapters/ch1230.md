## Chapter 1230 — Short Ruler

Using the Divine Sense, one of the fundamentals of the Yuan Control Art, posed no difficulty for Yang Kai. Facing Lu Ye this time, Yang Kai had meant to test the insights he'd gleaned over the past few days — and the result of that test truly gave him a pleasant surprise.

Those blazing spheres of black fire, under Yang Kai’s mental control, merged into sharp arrows and converged into a single point. They pierced straight through the heaven-covering crimson curtain, opening a hole that shot toward the depths of the sky. The surging baleful and sinister aura also poured out through that breach like a released torrent, its might diminishing greatly.

Yang Kai grinned, thunder and wind roaring at his back. Before Lu Ye could react, he darted forward; a Demonic Flame longsword traced a graceful arc and slashed directly at Lu Ye.

Lu Ye had long seen the terrifying might of the Demonic Flame. Though it wouldn’t necessarily possess him and burn him to death outright, he avoided contact when he could. His raucous laughter cut off abruptly; he gave a startled cry and hastily fell back. At the same time his hands repeatedly formed strange hand seals, and the red curtain that had been ripped open shivered and shifted, suddenly forming into a gigantic red hand that came down to cover Yang Kai’s head.

He even knew the Yuan Control Art, and the finesse with which he wielded it was in no way inferior to Yang Kai, who had only just comprehended this art — indeed, he might even have been slightly more adept.

The instant the red hand struck down, it felt as if heaven and earth were sealed off, causing one’s breath to catch. Even Yang Kai’s movements froze slightly.

Yang Kai let out a muffled grunt and furiously urged his Saint Yuan, tearing himself free from that swampy sensation. Without looking back he thrust a palm outward.

The same world-covering palm appeared. The Heaven-Covering Palm of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique met Lu Ye’s giant red hand; when the two palms collided Heaven-and-Earth Energy rolled and thundered, and the entire valley fractured and tossed as if an earthquake had struck.

Taking advantage of the moment, Yang Kai closed in, the Demonic Flame longsword whirring so tightly it left no gap. Black flames, under his Yuan Control Art, transformed into all manner of assaults and relentlessly pelted Lu Ye.

He had seen through it now — this Lu Ye’s cultivation in Divine Sense was indeed a notch above his own, but only slightly so. As long as Yang Kai stayed vigilant, the other would be unable to pose much threat to his Divine Sense. In contrast, Lu Ye’s Saint Yuan was far less pure and forceful than his, and his physical strength was also vastly inferior.

Which was why Yang Kai chose to close to melee — his strongest suit.

Furthermore, to prevent Lu Ye from escaping, Yang Kai poured Saint Yuan into his Purple Shield. Once the Purple Shield was saturated with Saint Yuan, it immediately exuded a layer of earthy yellow qi, and a grand sandstorm formed throughout the valley in an instant!

This was the built-in potency of the Purple Shield, and it was the first time Yang Kai had used it.

The Purple Shield had been forged from the turtle shell of a Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion; Yang Yan had specially fused that Ninth-Tier demonic beast’s Inner Core into it, granting the shield one of the abilities the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion had in life.

The sandstorm was that shield-granted ability!

Dust swirled, Yang Kai’s figure flickered and became unreadable, while under the ferocious sandstorm Lu Ye was forced to divert part of his spirit to defend against that strange assault, suddenly falling under Yang Kai’s initiative and struggling to respond.

Lu Ye was furious; he had never expected that after regaining freedom and reemerging upon the world following tens of thousands of years, his first opponent would be so formidable — far beyond the kind of plaything he’d imagined.

This loss of face enraged him to the point of humiliation.

Their Yuan Control Arts were nearly equal. Yang Kai had only just grasped it and could not perform perfectly, while Lu Ye’s body simply lacked the robust, pure Saint Yuan needed to unleash his full strength. When his Saint Yuan clashed with Yang Kai’s Demonic Flame, it always fell to the disadvantage.

With his Saint Yuan lagging and his Divine Sense unable to suppress his opponent, and with a weaker physique, Lu Ye was soon covered in wounds after a brief exchange and visibly faltering.

Yang Kai said nothing, only suppressing his opponent with relentless ferocity. The Demonic Flame longsword in his hand occasionally inflicted wounds, yet what frustrated him greatly was that his ever-victorious Demonic Flame, even when it touched Lu Ye’s body, was instantly extinguished by a faint cyan light flashing from him. Yang Kai could not tell what that light was, but it restrained his Demonic Flame completely — the injuries it caused were mere flesh wounds, never reaching the core.

Having resolved to slay this inexplicable enemy, Yang Kai naturally intended not to hold back.

He had not used spatial force.

The Space Blade he had created himself was not yet perfected — it was best suited for surprise attacks. If the first strike failed and the opponent became wary, it would lose all effectiveness.

He searched for the right opening, preparing to give Lu Ye a tremendous shock — one hit from his Space Blade would either kill or grievously wound him.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai’s frenzied suppression stirred Lu Ye’s earth-shattering wrath. After suffering another wound, Lu Ye snarled through clenched teeth, “Junior, you’re courting death!”

Saying that, he suddenly spat a mouthful of dark, tarry blood. Its stench was nauseating, and it contained an appalling potency — seemingly his Essence-Blood.

The Essence-Blood turned to a mist, condensed into a point, and then exploded. Lu Ye raised his hand, and a pitch-black short ruler appeared abruptly in his palm.

The short ruler was only two palms in length and thick as a fist, appearing unremarkable, but when it materialized Yang Kai’s heart skipped; a vague sense of peril rose from his depths.

He rarely felt that way, but whenever such a sensation arose it signaled unimaginably grave danger.

A feral grin split Lu Ye’s face as he poured Saint Yuan wildly into the jet-black short ruler. In an instant the world dimmed.

It seemed the short ruler absorbed all light, blotting out Yang Kai’s surroundings so completely that even the World-Ending Demon Eye could not see through it.

The sandstorm that had filled the valley abruptly ceased; glittering grains fell away and the roaring wind died.

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically. In that instant he sensed his Saint Yuan stuttering and failing to circulate; however he forced it, little power answered. Even his Sea of Consciousness clogged and faltered.

In the darkness something seemed to slam in, and a wave of deathly aura swept in — an annihilating presence that chilled the bones.

It couldn’t be caught! Nor could it be stopped!

A torrent of methods and thoughts flashed through Yang Kai’s mind; he knew that whether he used Saint Yuan or Divine Sense he couldn’t withstand this earth-shattering, uncanny blow. Even if he tried to flee, with both Saint Yuan and Divine Sense suppressed he could neither move nor tear open space.

In a flash Yang Kai gathered a droplet of Golden Blood at his fingertip. A startling surge of life force and Qi and blood trembled outward, and the droplet transformed into golden light that stabbed into the darkness.

Life’s surge and the world-ending aura collided and neutralized each other. Unexpectedly, no sound rang out — only golden light and black radiance clashed in the valley. For a moment their strengths were evenly matched; the two forces met as equals.

“Impossible.” Lu Ye’s face finally changed. Though he had been suppressed by Yang Kai, he’d always believed he hadn’t shown his true hand and stayed calm. Now wielding such a formidable Secret Treasure, he had resolved to kill Yang Kai and was confident Yang Kai couldn’t stop this strike.

Contrary to his expectation, when his ruler came down there was no scene of flesh and blood torn asunder. Instead, a surging sea-like force of Qi and blood arose and actually halted his attack.

He must be killed at once! Lu Ye’s thought flashed, his face turning hideously fierce.

A mere cultivator of the First Stage of the Saint King Realm could actually contend with him. If allowed to grow further, how could he not become peerless? To snuff out hazards at their root had been Lu Ye’s creed through tens of thousands of years.

In this moment he truly treated Yang Kai as a thorn in his eye and a splinter in his flesh — elimination was the only recourse.

A flash of ruthlessness passed his eyes. He spat another mouthful of Essence-Blood; in the face of the golden light the pitch-black radiance surged massively, the blackness swelling to cover the gold and threatening to sweep across Yang Kai and swallow him.

Yang Kai flicked his finger and sent another droplet of Golden Blood flying. The golden light flared again, violent and towering, illuminating all and piercing through the shroud of black.

“Ah—” Lu Ye cried out in astonishment as the black radiance collapsed inch by inch and light returned to the world.

In the valley both Yang Kai and Lu Ye stood in place, but Lu Ye’s body lurched and swayed, his face deathly pale as if his Yuan Qi had been grievously damaged.

Yang Kai’s face was drawn and ugly, but he bore not a scratch and still bristled with energy.

Through the red mist Yang Kai stared at Lu Ye; a cold light filled his eyes like the north wind blowing from ancient, unmoving glaciers — bone-piercing and frigid.

Lu Ye could not help shuddering!

A pitch-black blade-like strike suddenly shot from the front. Before Lu Ye could defend, it had already arrived.

Panic-stricken, Lu Ye twisted his body to avoid a vital blow, but at that moment a faint sting came from his left arm.

Turning his head Lu Ye felt as if his soul had left his body; he saw that one of his arms had been severed by that very attack.

What sort of strike was that, one that he had not even sensed, utterly without aura, yet so powerful?

To Lu Ye’s horror, the severed arm lying on the ground was clearly missing something — it could not perfectly match the wound, and he did not know how that could be.

While he gaped in dread, Yang Kai’s murderous intent rose like a tide, ready to finish him off. Yet Lu Ye flashed and suddenly became a streak of red light, speeding away.

Whatever secret art he’d used was unknown; by the time Yang Kai’s Divine Sense detected his trace, Lu Ye was already three to five li away.
