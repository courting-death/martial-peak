## Chapter 657 — If He Dies, You Die!

While with the Duao Alliance, Yang Kai learned much about the mysteries of crystal stones and had, of course, heard the term "Saint Crystal."

A Saint Crystal of the same volume as an ordinary Crystal Stone contained energy of an entirely different order—its value exceeded that of the latter by more than a hundredfold.

And that was a comparison of sheer energy alone.

In terms of true worth, a Saint Crystal’s value was something a mere Crystal Stone could not compare to, for Crystal Stones were everywhere while Saint Crystals were exceedingly rare.

Things have always been valued for their rarity!

“There’s actually a Saint Crystal here?” Han Fei could no longer sit still; watching Yang Kai mine Crystal Stones while she lacked storage capacity had already been torment, and now he had obtained a Saint Crystal!

This was a treasure that could greatly aid even those entering the Saint Realm; with a Saint Crystal in hand, even she could quickly raise her strength by some degree.

Such a windfall left Han Fei both envious and jealous.

Whether she could store it no longer entered Han Fei’s thoughts; she hurried up to the cave wall and began hammering at it.

Yang Kai would not be outdone; his pace suddenly quickened considerably.

Stone chips flew, interspersed with Crystal Stones blasted free; Han Fei’s Divine Sense was tightly focused, sweeping across the scattered fragments—once she sensed they were only ordinary Crystal Stones, she paid them no heed.

Yang Kai’s True Yuan, however, burst out fiercely; under the control of his will it became an invisible force that gathered up the Crystal Stones Han Fei ignored and stuffed them into the Black Book Space.

Ding dong—

A clear chime sounded; Han Fei’s eyes and hands were quicker, and she seized a Crystal Stone that looked different before Yang Kai could, examined it, and with a brightening face clutched it to her palm in elation.

She had also obtained a Saint Crystal.

But the next moment she ground her teeth in spite—Yang Kai had actually found another one and was spinning it between his fingers mockingly at her.

“Just you wait!” Han Fei forced herself calm and redoubled her pace.

For a time, the two of them seemed possessed, exerting themselves to the utmost in gathering.

Saint Crystals were extremely rare, only appearing perhaps once or twice by chance; even so, after who knew how long Yang Kai had collected more than a dozen, while Han Fei fared even better—her cultivation was stronger, her speed quicker, and she often snatched newly revealed Saint Crystals first.

But the ordinary Crystal Stones she mined could not be carried away by her, and all those fell into Yang Kai’s hands.

Thus in overall haul, the two were essentially evenly matched.

Boom—

With a tremendous roar, the cave wall before them suddenly collapsed, revealing a vacuum passage, and from that passage surged forth currents of energy that set the heart trembling.

It seemed that the two of them had pierced a conduit below, and the energy here reacted violently.

Crackle, crackle—

Cracking sounds like shelling hurried in from all sides.

Yang Kai and Han Fei both changed expression and stopped their actions, standing still as statues, not daring to breathe.

Crackle, crackle—

The noises grew louder and fiercer; flakes of stone began to fall from above.

Yang Kai’s brows twitched and his face darkened as he murmured, “Something’s not right.”

“I think… we should leave.” Han Fei nodded lightly.

“Go!” Yang Kai barked, no longer caring for anything else, and turned instantly, racing back along their path like lightning.

Han Fei followed close behind, never leaving his side.

The ground suddenly trembled; the Heaven-and-Earth Energy in the passage turned violently chaotic and unstable. Stone chips and dust sifted down from above as the cracking sounds grew louder.

Yang Kai scanned the surroundings while forcing himself forward at top speed.

He knew this place had always been an unstable volcanic interior; they had been rampaging in its depths for some days now, and that recklessness had likely triggered further changes—changes that could lead to a full volcanic eruption.

The caverns beneath the volcano would no longer be safe.

At the brink of life and death, both moved with desperate swiftness; in the blink of an eye they reached the huge cavern where they had earlier rested and climbed up the corridor they had passed through, and soon the scorching lava came into view.

“Come!” Yang Kai shouted, grabbing Han Fei’s waist and unfurling his Wings of Yang Flame; he wrapped them both within the Yang Flame and plunged into the lava, riding the eruption upward at full speed.

Driven by the violent geyser of lava, their upward speed was many times faster than when they had descended.

Boom, boom, boom—

The thunderous blasts deafened the ears; sensing the massive, destructive energies welling up, both Yang Kai and Han Fei wore extremely grave expressions.

Outside the volcanic mouth, figures hovered in midair, each radiating powerful qi.

At this moment those people were divided into two groups, facing each other like rivals.

On the left stood the belligerent Ancient Demon Clan contingent led by Chu Jian, while on the right were Li Rong and Hua Mo with another faction of their people.

As Yang Kai had predicted, Li Rong had indeed kept a close watch on Chu Jian’s movements; when she learned he had led many experts out of his territory, she immediately suspected his intentions.

She sent word to Hua Mo and led the Mo Shen Fort’s people to reinforce her, but they were still too late.

By the time she and Hua Mo arrived, Yang Kai and Han Fei had already been driven into the volcano by Chu Jian, their life or death unknown.

Li Rong, usually kind and tolerant, felt murderous intent toward Chu Jian for the first time.

Yet before confirming the whereabouts of Yang Kai and Han Fei, Li Rong restrained herself and ordered Chu Jian to help search for the two.

In recent days Ancient Demon Clan experts had plunged into the volcanic interior one after another to seek their traces; Li Rong even went in personally, but to no avail.

By today, most of the Ancient Demon Clan had come to believe that the human and Commander Han Fei had perished within the volcano.

Chu Jian’s face was sullen; rather than showing remorse, he was tinged with excitement as he looked toward Li Rong from across the distance, curious how she would act next.

Now that the matter had escalated, Chu Jian would not back down; over the years he had been probing Li Rong’s limits while strengthening himself, and he knew her weaknesses well.

If war were to break out here, Chu Jian would not fear it—indeed, he was eager.

Imprisoned too long, the Ancient Demon Clan had been dulled, their fangs blunted; now was the time to awaken their nature and remind them they should crave the baptism of blood.

“Lady Li…” Hua Mo’s face was equally grim as he said after a moment of pondering, “Commander Han Fei is most likely already fallen.”

Li Rong closed her eyes; her powerful Divine Sense showed no fear of the yang energy burning below as she probed inside the volcano, but she found nothing.

Hearing Hua Mo, Li Rong opened her eyes; the poised, mature beauty of her face suddenly darkened, she grit her silver teeth, her body trembling, her gaze full of hatred as she coldly demanded, “Chu Jian, do you know what you have done?”

Chu Jian sneered and nodded, “Of course I know. You need not remind me, Lady Li.”

Li Rong’s expression turned indescribably grim; she shook her head slowly and spoke in a low voice, “You do not understand. If that human is unharmed, I can spare your life; if he is harmed, you shall be buried here with him.”

Her fierce shout carried an invisible force; Chu Jian’s face changed and he immediately took a few steps back, flinging out a hand to block as ripples spread. The sleeve of his arm suddenly split into filaments and blew away on the wind.

Chu Jian’s eyes widened—he at last realized that this woman who had always seemed merciful and tolerant far exceeded him in strength.

Still, he was a leader of men at the first two Stages of Saint Realm and quickly steadied himself, his visage savage as he roared, “Lady Li, why do you not care for Commander Han Fei’s life, yet obsess over that human brat? Why is that?”

Hua Mo beside him frowned, his face full of puzzlement.

Li Rong’s words had indeed been puzzling—she had not mentioned Han Fei’s survival, yet seemed solely concerned with Yang Kai; Hua Mo could not fathom her reason.

“You do not need to know why!” Li Rong had no interest in explaining; she drew a deep breath, looked up at the chaotic heavens with a distant stare, and softly said, “You should know this: I can tolerate you committing any crime, even allow you to turn your blades against me and seize power! But I will never permit you to kill that human… If he dies, you die!”

Chu Jian’s breath stalled; Li Rong’s words were absolute, and he understood she was not speaking empty threats—this time he felt he had violated some grave taboo.

Chu Jian privately thought Li Rong foolish—how could she say such things before so many of their people without fearing her authority would be questioned?

Even Hua Mo looked bewildered, let alone the others.

“I give you three days. After three days, if I do not see him alive or at least his corpse, I will personally strike you down!” Li Rong said icily, issuing her final ultimatum to Chu Jian.

Chu Jian felt an inexplicable unease, yet his face grew wild with exhilaration as he licked his lips, filled with the lust for battle.

He had no intention of obeying Li Rong’s order; events had reached this point and in any case he intended to act.

Before he could move, a violent rumbling echoed from within the volcano; the world’s energies turned perilous and a deathly aura billowed up from below.

Everyone’s faces changed as they peered down; within the volcano the lava churned and became highly unstable.

Whoosh—

A jet of lava blasted upwards, shooting a hundred zhang into the air before dispersing into a rain of molten rock.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh—

More and more streams of lava shot out like unleashed arrows, each flow containing destructive potential.

“Lady Li, flee!” Hua Mo’s expression went white as he shouted, immediately retreating and attempting to get away from the volcanic mouth.
