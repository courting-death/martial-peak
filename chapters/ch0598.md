## Chapter 598 — You Blind Fools

In the Spirit-Nourishing Hall, Yang Kai sat upright at the head seat, with Shan Qingluo and Bilo standing respectfully by his sides, one to the left and one to the right, like two maids, fair and delicate as spring orchids and autumn chrysanthemums, enchanting to behold.

Several elders of Gu Yun Island sat below, accompanying him, each with a solemn and restrained expression, eyes fixed straight ahead, sitting properly in their seats.

A maid served fragrant tea. After some polite greetings among the elders, it became clear that Yang Kai was not fond of speaking, so an awkward silence soon fell.

The silent and eerily oppressive aura pressed heavily upon everyone; all gazed expectantly towards the entrance, their Divine Senses spreading out, silently praying for Elder Han Zhao’s early return.

Two full hours passed, yet Elder Han Zhao was still nowhere to be seen.

The elders felt like there was a thorn in their backs, palms and soles sweaty, but they had no choice but to grit their teeth and sit rigidly, waiting.

Outside the hall’s door, Gu Feng peeked hesitantly, a face full of lingering fear and complex hesitation.

Previously, he had cast lustful glances toward Shan Qingluo, but unexpectedly, she had sent him flying with a single strike, nearly knocking him unconscious. Choking on a bellyful of seawater, upon returning to Gu Yun Island, Gu Feng learned that the woman had already entered the Spirit-Nourishing Hall.

Unable to fathom her identity or background, Gu Feng dared not rush in recklessly, cursing himself for being shortsighted—how could he have been so foolish as to entertain desires for such a woman?

Lost in thought, Gu Feng suddenly felt two auras swiftly approaching.

Looking up, he saw Elder Han Zhao and Li Yuanchun of the Tai Yi Sect flying over together.

Gu Feng’s joy was beyond measure; his face bore respect and admiration. Before he could greet Li Yuanchun, he heard the latter roar angrily, “Gu Feng, you have an audacity like no other!”

“Huh?” Gu Feng was dumbfounded, not understanding why this Tai Yi Sect elder immediately questioned him so harshly.

His vision blurred as Li Yuanchun was already in front of him, striking out ten fierce palms in rapid succession, leaving Gu Feng dazed and bruised.

“Hmph! That’s only a slight lesson,” Li Yuanchun said coldly. “How you are dealt with next depends on that young master’s mood. You better pray you live to see the sun tomorrow!”

“Elder Li…” Gu Feng touched his swollen cheek, confusedly looking at Li Yuanchun. He had assumed that since Li Yuanchun had come to Gu Yun Island, he must be on his side—they were after all members from overseas.

With his help to oppose that enchanting woman, the opposition would hardly cause trouble.

Yet, Li Yuanchun’s brutal beating felt baffling, and his consciousness was near fading.

Even so, Gu Feng bore no resentment, for in the overseas realms, the Tai Yi Sect was the greatest sect. Their three Divine Roaming Beyond Masters were legendary figures—ordinary men could hardly catch a glimpse of them. Today, Li Yuanchun’s active arrival on Gu Yun Island was already a great honor.

Elder Han Zhao watched this seemingly absurd scene with no humor, his emotions churning turbulently.

He had just gone to the Tai Yi Sect to invite Li Yuanchun out, but as expected, he was stopped at the sect’s entrance. No matter how he pleaded, the disciples would not let him in.

With no other choice, Han Zhao had forced his way in but was promptly captured by the sect’s elite.

The commotion finally alerted the elders of the Tai Yi Sect, who released him after he explained everything, hastily summoning Li Yuanchun.

Among the overseas group traveling to Zhongdu, there were no disciples from Gu Yun Island, as their sect treasure—the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique—had long been found. Thus, there was no need for them to journey to Zhongdu, but there were members from Tai Yi Sect among them.

Gu Yun Island’s people did not know Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo’s identities, but the Tai Yi Sect’s people were well aware.

Upon hearing Yang Kai had arrived, Li Yuanchun had rushed over anxiously, continually scolding Han Zhao for rambling oddly without getting to the point, nearly causing a grave mishap.

Seeing Li Yuanchun’s solemn demeanor, Han Zhao finally realized how extraordinary Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo’s statuses were.

Even their own island master had been assaulted, showing how weighty those two were in Li Yuanchun’s eyes.

Who exactly were they, for Elder Li to treat things so seriously?

“Come with me inside, you damn scoundrel!” Li Yuanchun shouted angrily and strode into the Spirit-Nourishing Hall.

Gu Feng rubbed his cheek silently, deeply aggrieved, and grudgingly followed behind Li Yuanchun.

Han Zhao sniffed and followed.

Inside, everyone had already heard the commotion outside. The elders of Gu Yun Island wore awkward and displeased expressions, but knowing it was Li Yuanchun who had beaten their island master, they dared not bear grudges.

When their gaze turned to Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo, their expressions involuntarily grew grave and respectful.

Yang Kai gave a wry smile. Li Yuanchun pounding Gu Feng like that was obviously to vent Yang Kai’s anger—and to shield Gu Feng. Knowing what Yang Kai is like, without this display he might well have wiped out Gu Yun Island over the matter.

Being beaten was humiliating, but better than death.

He shook his head, thinking Li Yuanchun had simply overthought things; he himself held no grudge.

Loud, hearty laughter came from outside as Li Yuanchun entered the Spirit-Nourishing Hall. Upon seeing Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo, his eyes brightened, joy clear:

“So it is indeed Young Master Yang’s honorable presence! I knew that with Young Master Yang’s skill, he must be fated by Heaven, not to have perished early. Seeing Young Master Yang safe and sound puts my heart at ease.”

“Thank you for your concern, Elder Li. I was lucky to escape with my life,” Yang Kai said, rising with a smile.

“Miss Shan!” Li Yuanchun cupped his fists respectfully toward Shan Qingluo.

“Elder Li, you are too courteous,” Shan Qingluo replied with a graceful bow.

Seeing Yang Kai and Li Yuanchun greet each other like old friends, the elders of Gu Yun Island grew even more perplexed, exchanging glances silently. Li Yuanchun’s overseas status commanded deep respect; even someone like Gu Feng had to show utmost deference. Yet this young man talked with him so naturally…

Who on earth was he? Everyone grew increasingly shocked.

“You blind fools!” Li Yuanchun scolded the gathered elders, his face stern. “Do you even know who this young master is?”

“Please enlighten us, Elder Li,” they said respectfully.

“This young master is the direct heir of the Zhongdu Yang Family, the family head himself!”

“Zhongdu Yang Family?” A wave of exclamations arose, and their gazes toward Yang Kai shifted notably.

“You did not participate on our last trip inland, so you do not know the situation there. I do not blame you for that, but surely you have heard the legends: the Zhongdu Yang Family produced an unparalleled prodigy, and that is the young master before you!” Li Yuanchun smiled wryly. “He commands over twenty elite masters beyond Divine Roaming, yet you funnily enough let Young Master Yang become a registered disciple here, raising what? Peacocks? How noble must those peacocks be, to require Young Master Yang to tend them? Elder Han Zhao, do you know your crime?”

Han Zhao sweat profusely and hastened forward, trembling:

“Elder Li, I didn’t know Young Master Yang’s background was so significant. I thought he was just an ordinary fisherman!”

“You thought?” Li Yuanchun sneered, “Shortsighted fool!”

“Elder Li, please calm your anger,” Han Zhao’s face pained, but he steeled himself and said through gritted teeth, “I will personally kill those peacocks soon.”

“That’s unnecessary.” Yang Kai shook his head lightly. “I was merely hiding my identity here, seeking peace for half a year. It is not Elder Han’s fault.”

“Thank you, Young Master Yang, thank you!” Han Zhao was overwhelmed with gratitude. Although those peacocks were not precious beasts, they were more important to him than his life. He could never bear to kill them himself; hearing Yang Kai’s defense filled him with gratitude.

“If Young Master Yang says so, I will not hold you accountable. Gu Feng, come here immediately!” Li Yuanchun turned angrily toward Gu Yun Island’s island master.

“I admit my fault,” Gu Feng said promptly before being questioned. “Punish me as you please, Elder Li. I will bear no grudge.”

As he spoke, his eyes glanced toward Shan Qingluo above, shivering involuntarily and quickly looking away.

“You fool!” Li Yuanchun laughed bitterly, “Do you think saying that will smooth things over? Ridiculous. I think you no longer want to be island master. If so, just say so — I will send you on your way now.”

Gu Feng trembled silently.

“Elder Li, these are trivial matters, no need to pursue them,” Yang Kai interjected, not wishing to make things awkward. After all, it was his concealed identity and extended stay that caused the trouble. Gu Feng was careless, but not enough for Yang Kai to take seriously.

Li Yuanchun thought for a moment, then nodded lightly:

“Since Young Master Yang has spoken, let this matter be handled lightly.”

Gu Feng hurriedly added, “Thank you, Young Master, for your magnanimity.”

Yang Kai nodded subtly, no more words, then looked at Li Yuanchun:

“Elder, you were summoned here for a reason, I suppose you know why?”

Li Yuanchun’s face brightened, nodding quickly:

“Yes, yes! When I heard Young Master Yang arrived in the overseas realms, I already guessed your purpose. Young Master Yang is truly a man of integrity. On behalf of the overseas sects, I thank you deeply for your great kindness!”

“No need for thanks. Since I said before that after overcoming that crisis I would return everything, I certainly will not go back on my word.”

Li Yuanchun beamed with joy. “Please wait a little longer. Before coming here, I already sent my disciples to inform the overseas sects. They should arrive within half a day.”

“No rush,” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

After the earlier tension was resolved, the atmosphere in the Spirit-Nourishing Hall turned warm and harmonious. The elders of Gu Yun Island now truly realized the terrifying power Yang Kai wielded, daring not to underestimate him in the slightest. They arranged a banquet, raising cups in respectful toasts.

Yang Kai accepted all invitations, drinking freely.

Soon, everyone found that this Yang Family young master bore no airs. If treated well, he was quite easy to get along with.

This discovery made them try even harder to curry favor, hoping to build a good relationship with Yang Kai.
