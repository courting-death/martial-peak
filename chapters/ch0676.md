## Chapter 676 — Leiguang Divine Cult

"If you, my friend, can take up residence in my Divine Cult as a guest alchemist, I am willing to provide very generous terms," Duan Hai said with sincere expression; although he was of the Transcendent Realm and at least one generation senior to Yang Kai, he still addressed him warmly as "friend."

"What terms are you offering, Brother Duan? Speak plainly first—it's wise to compare options," Elder Du said, knowing Yang Kai was ignorant of such matters and on his own began to probe, ostensibly for Yang Kai's sake.

Duan Hai gave a wry smile and shook his head. "Elder Du, since he's your man, how could I squeeze him?"

With a solemn look he regarded Yang Kai and said, "The Divine Cult will provide you with medicinal materials; for any Pill you refine, you may take fifth of its value as remuneration. In other words, if you refine an elixir worth one hundred Crystal Stones, the Divine Cult will give you twenty Crystal Stones."

Elder Du's expression shifted; he gave a slight nod.

Yang Kai watched their faces and knew these terms would certainly not be poor.

"This is only the most basic condition. The Divine Cult will give you the most comfortable alchemy environment and prioritize your needs; as long as you do not harm the interests of our Divine Cult, anything can be agreed to. How does that sound?"

Having spoken, Duan Hai looked at Yang Kai expectantly, waiting for his reply.

To be frank, the conditions he proposed were already very generous; that twenty-percent share was not something ordinary alchemists could obtain. Even a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level alchemist appointed as a guest alchemist would generally not reach this split.

If Yang Kai had any other demands, he could discuss them.

Yang Kai's brow knitted slightly as he pondered for a moment, then he looked at Elder Du and asked, "What do you think, senior?"

"The terms are good," Elder Du replied honestly. "But whether you go or not, it depends entirely on your own will."

"Since he's Elder Du's friend... there should be no problem." Yang Kai smiled broadly; in any case he had already planned to find a power to rely on for the time being, and Elder Du's endorsement made him feel considerably more at ease.

Duan Hai was overjoyed at these words; a smile spread across his face. "Friends really are easy to deal with."

"However, the terms must be adjusted a bit." Yang Kai shifted the topic.

"Do tell," Duan Hai said, his expression turning serious.

"I do not want the twenty percent... I'll only take ten percent!" Yang Kai raised one finger.

Duan Hai and Elder Du were both taken aback, yet neither interrupted, waiting in silence. Yang Kai's voluntarily relinquishing half of his due profits clearly signaled he had other motives.

"I hope your Divine Cult can do me a favor. Of course, this favor poses no danger to you."

"What favor?" Duan Hai inquired.

"When the time comes I will tell you, and besides, I will not remain in Leiguang Divine Cult forever. I hope that when I leave, I will not encounter any obstruction."

"That is easy to promise." Duan Hai hastened to nod. "My Leiguang Divine Cult has more than one guest alchemist; the comings and goings of these guests are decided by themselves. The Divine Cult never forces anyone to stay."

"No problem then." Yang Kai chuckled.

Duan Hai beamed with joy. "Then it's settled?"

Yang Kai gave a serious nod.

Elder Du smiled and said, "Congratulations, Brother Duan. Actually, I am very reluctant to see this young friend leave, but he has his own affairs to attend to, so I can only bid him farewell with a heavy heart."

Duan Hai said with significance, "Elder Du, why not also come to my Divine Cult as a guest alchemist?"

"You have an appetite too large, don't you?" Elder Du chuckled hoarsely. "You actually want to hire me?"

"A Saint-Grade alchemist—what force would not want one?"

"I'm afraid you cannot afford the price," Elder Du said with a smile.

Duan Hai's expression turned bitter. "That is also true."

He shook his head in annoyance, then looked to Yang Kai and asked, "Friend, when are you ready to depart?"

"I can leave at any time."

"How about now?" Duan Hai looked impatient; Yang Kai found it amusing and nodded faintly.

"No time like the present. Let us go." Duan Hai rose as he spoke.

"Allow me to take my leave with a friend first." Yang Kai stood and stepped outside to find Mi Na; after these days together they had gotten along well, and it would be rude not to say farewell before leaving.

In the side room, Duan Hai and Elder Du sat quietly.

Suddenly Elder Du's voice dropped as he said, "Duan Hai, don't say I didn't warn you—this young friend should not be taken lightly. Once he comes to your Leiguang, do not slight him."

Duan Hai looked astonished and urgently asked, "Elder Du, what do you mean?"

Du Wan slowly shook his head and said no more; Duan Hai was left baffled.

After a short while Yang Kai returned, having bid Mi Na farewell. There was nothing more to pack, and Duan Hai led him out of the Alchemists' Association. Mi Na waved with evident reluctance; during Yang Kai's stay her alchemy had improved rapidly, far quicker than under her own master's tutelage, so she was truly reluctant to see him go.

With a broad sweep of his hand Duan Hai wrapped Yang Kai in a sheath of pure True Yuan; the two rose swiftly and flew out of Giant Stone City.

As they traveled, Duan Hai's attitude toward Yang Kai was very affable. Looking down, he pointed out and explained the foundations and wealth of the Leiguang Divine Cult.

To let Yang Kai quickly feel a sense of belonging, Duan Hai spared no praise for Leiguang; from his words Yang Kai learned a little about the power.

Near the snowy mountains there were no fewer than a thousand peaks large and small, and the Leiguang Divine Cult occupied a portion of them.

After barely an hour's time, the two arrived at the Divine Cult's territory.

They landed on a mountain peak where a bit of chill lingered, but overall the slopes were lush and verdant, rich with Spiritual Qi. Halfway up the mountainside many medicinal herbs were planted and their fragrance filled the air; at the summit a few simple cottages stood.

Duan Hai said, "This place used to be the residence of a guest alchemist of our Divine Cult, but he resigned his post a few months ago; for now it is unoccupied. Guest Alchemist Yang, would you like to live here? If you find it too plain, you may instead go to where our people gather."

"No need, this place is fine." Yang Kai nodded; he was quite satisfied. He did not need to make connections with others—crowded places brought trouble, and it was far more carefree to be here.

Duan Hai smiled upon hearing this. "Guest Alchemist Yang truly has the heart to make achievements in the Way of Alchemy. I was worried you would choose to go to the crowded gathering spots."

"Oh?" Yang Kai looked at him in surprise.

"Those guest alchemists who choose the crowded gathering spots tend to pursue fame, fortune, power, and prestige. Our Divine Cult generally does not care much for such people. It is those like Guest Alchemist Yang, with a detached temperament, who will surely accomplish something in the future." Duan Hai smiled. "By the way, this is your guest plaque—please carry it with you. With this plaque you can travel unimpeded within our Divine Cult; except for certain forbidden areas, any place is accessible."

Saying so, he handed Yang Kai a pitch-black plaque.

Yang Kai took it, glanced over it briefly, and then put it away.

"Later I will assign someone to assist you. If you have any needs, you can tell them, and they can handle matters for you."

Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

"If Guest Alchemist Yang has no other matters, I shall take my leave." Duan Hai looked to Yang Kai for assent.

"No more business."

Duan Hai nodded slightly and then unfolded his movement technique and departed swiftly.

Once he had vanished, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and probed the surroundings.

This peak was not especially high, yet not low either—about a thousand zhang in height. Standing atop, white clouds curled about like an immortal realm.

The conditions were quite good, and a faint smile appeared on Yang Kai's face.

From Duan Hai's words Yang Kai understood that until he resigned his guest position, this mountain would belong to him. Of course, the Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine growing on the peak still belonged to the Leiguang Divine Cult.

Yang Kai first walked the length and breadth of the mountain, inspected the few acres of herb fields, and found the medicinal plants flourishing without needing much tending; evidently dedicated hands looked after them regularly.

Spiritual Qi on the peak was abundant, making it very suitable for cultivation.

After checking his own mountain, Yang Kai wandered among the neighboring peaks.

Among the nearby peaks were other guest alchemists of the Leiguang Divine Cult; since they were all alchemists, their topics were similar. When they learned Yang Kai was a Spirit-Grade Lower-Level alchemist, those guest alchemists were astonished, repeatedly exclaiming how admirable the younger generation could be.

Through idle conversation with them Yang Kai gleaned much information about the Leiguang Divine Cult.

Overall, the power was acceptable. Indeed, as Duan Hai had said, the treatment of guest alchemists was generous. If a guest wished to leave, the Cult would not detain them—only prepare lavish gifts to send them off.

Moreover, every guest alchemist had a capable assistant by their side, and without exception those assistants were fair as flowers and tender of body.

Having lived in isolation for so long, these alchemists naturally required beauty to enliven their lives; these assistants had been assigned by the Leiguang Divine Cult to assist and serve the alchemists, able to meet any of their requests.

These assistants were also willing to remain; indeed, there was competition within the Divine Cult to win the chance to serve a guest alchemist.

After all, the status of an alchemist was honorable—being linked to one was an aspiration. And these peaks were excellent cultivation sites; in crowded gathering places there was not so abundant Spiritual Qi. Cultivating here greatly aided their strength, and staying near an alchemist guaranteed no shortage of Pills for cultivation.

Such benefits naturally attracted many people's interest.

Yang Kai spent two or three consecutive days wandering nearby, visiting many peers to make his face known, and came to understand the Leiguang Divine Cult's considerable scale and wealth.

The forces in Zhongdu could not compare to this place; not only were the cultivators' realms disparate, but in Spiritual Qi, supplies, and cultivation manuals, the Tongxuan Continent far outstripped Zhongdu by several grades.

Realizing these gaps, Yang Kai could not help but feel a little rueful.

Three days later Yang Kai returned to his mountain.

As soon as he reached his peak his expression changed slightly, for he sensed a trace of life in one of the cottages.

Had the assistant Duan Hai spoke of already arrived?
