## Chapter 2120 — No Danger After All

Hidden within the void, Uncle Li watched Yang Kai below with a hint of surprise, let out a jaunty whistle, and said, “This kid… his thinking is awfully meticulous.”

"Did Eldest Brother Yang know I was here?" Mo Xiaoqi was stunned, watching Yang Kai greet her direction from not far away. She hurriedly responded, but no matter what, her voice could not reach Yang Kai's ears.

The space was sealed by a powerful force, isolating everything inside from the outside.

Mo Xiaoqi immediately grew anxious.

Over there, Yang Kai chuckled and said, “Xiaoqi, as long as you can see me, that’s enough. Be good and go home—if fate wills it, we will surely meet again!”

"Oh..." Mo Xiaoqi nodded, "Alright."

The sense of loss she had felt at not seeing Yang Kai one last time vanished after hearing those words; she smiled.

Yang Kai turned his head to look at the woman in red and said, "Aunt Feng..."

“Who is this Aunt Feng? Who exactly are you calling?” The red-clad woman fixed Yang Kai with a frosty stare.

"Senior..."

"Try calling me that one more time!"

Yang Kai took a deep breath and said, "Honored one... I think I already know why you are blocking my way here..."

"Stop acting clever!" the woman in red snorted, cutting him off.

Yang Kai paused for a few moments, frowned, and said, "Still won't admit it... If that's the case, then..."

At this, he lifted his gaze to the void, tenderness in his eyes, and gently declared, "Xiaoqi, be good and stay at home. When Eldest Brother Yang has gathered the betrothal gifts, he will come to marry you!"

The woman in red's expression changed dramatically, and she shouted, "Kid, how dare you..."

Before she finished, she seemed to realize something; she gritted her teeth and said, "You're very cunning!"

Only then did she realize Yang Kai's words had not been meant for Mo Xiaoqi, but deliberately spoken for her to hear... and her reaction confirmed his previous guess.

"That's right, I am Xiaoqi's Aunt Feng!" The woman in red, seeing her act exposed, simply admitted it, staring at Yang Kai, "Kid, I don't care where you come from or what bright future you may have. Xiaoqi is not someone you can covet. Remember this well!"

"So you came to warn me not to be a toad lusting after a swan?" Yang Kai said calmly, "If that's all, you could have just said so earlier."

"At least you have some self-awareness!" The woman in red snorted, "Since you understand, I won't bully the young. Remember my words: if you ever have improper thoughts about Xiaoqi, I will make you regret being born in this world!"

"Your threat... is rather soft and lacks force." Yang Kai smiled indifferently, "But rest assured, we are just friends."

"That's best!" The woman in red nodded in satisfaction.

Yang Kai smiled again and said, “Compared to tender, innocent maidens, I prefer mature, dazzling beauties. For example… someone like you, honored one—truly tantalizing.”

"Pfft..." In the void, Uncle Li spat out his tea again. His jaw seemed dislocated, mouth agape, and after a while, he came to his senses, cold sweat on his face, "He flirted with her... Ninth Lady actually got flirted with..."

As he spoke, he couldn’t help bursting into hearty laughter: “A snot-nosed brat actually dared flirt with the Ninth Lady—if the Great Emperor were to hear of this, he would surely laugh himself breathless!”

"Why does Eldest Brother Yang talk like that..." On the other side, Mo Xiaoqi blushed and spat, "So shameless!"

"You like someone like me?" The woman in red looked a bit odd, gazing at Yang Kai with interest, "Just for your bold words, I could rip out your wicked tongue!"

"But..." She suddenly changed her tone, smiled sweetly, and a seductive charm flashed in her beautiful eyes, her voice soft, "I do like your straightforwardness. If you ever surpass me in cultivation, I might just give you a chance to pursue me!"

"Haha, it's a deal!" Yang Kai laughed heartily.

The woman in red stared deeply at Yang Kai for a long while before sneering, "Overestimating yourself!"

As soon as she finished, her figure flickered and she vanished.

"Honored one, you destroyed my flying Secret Treasure and just left? Isn't that a bit unfair?" Yang Kai shouted into the void.

As soon as he finished, a streak of azure light shot over from afar and stopped in front of him.

Yang Kai looked closely and saw that the object wrapped in the azure light was a miniature wooden boat, about three inches long, radiating the energy of a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure.

"She really compensated me?" Yang Kai was a bit surprised, but didn't hesitate and put the wooden boat into his Spatial Ring.

Then, he stood quietly in the void.

After a while he suddenly broke out in a cold sweat, his clothes damp in an instant. He gasped for air like a fish out of water.

The clash with the woman in red wasn't exactly dangerous, but it was far from peaceful.

After all, she was a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm! Far above Yang Kai's own realm. Even if he unlocked the gold and silver seal on his abdomen, he wasn't fully confident he could escape her grasp.

So he could only take a risky gamble. Fortunately, at the critical moment, he guessed her true identity.

It wasn't hard to figure out.

He had no grudge with the woman in red. For someone at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm to come looking for trouble, there had to be a reason.

After thinking it over, Yang Kai could only connect it to Mo Xiaoqi.

Before leaving Fenglin City, Xiaoqi had left a jade slip, telling Yang Kai that Aunt Feng had come to capture her.

With Mo Xiaoqi's Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation, how could she escape Aunt Feng's pursuit? Being taken home was a certainty...

Most likely, after capturing Mo Xiaoqi, Aunt Feng learned of Yang Kai's existence from her and came here specifically to test him.

Yang Kai could understand Aunt Feng's actions. An innocent young girl often mentioned a strange man; as an elder, Aunt Feng naturally needed to check Yang Kai's character and see if Mo Xiaoqi was being deceived by a scoundrel...

After that, things were simple. Knowing her identity, Yang Kai realized Mo Xiaoqi must be hidden nearby.

And the woman in red definitely wouldn't kill him.

But when she left, she seemed to use some soul secret technique, and he was almost seduced by her charm...

Fortunately, Aunt Feng underestimated Yang Kai's soul strength, allowing him to barely resist with the power of the Warm Spirit Lotus. Otherwise, if Mo Xiaoqi saw him in such a state, she might never associate with him again.

"She should be gone now?" Yang Kai muttered to himself, feeling exhausted, but still hurried toward Qin Chaoyang's location.

After a quick check, Qin Chaoyang was merely unconscious, without a scratch on him. It seemed Aunt Feng had deliberately knocked him out with the first strike to create a chance to speak with Yang Kai alone.

In the distance, Uncle Li used a great technique to travel through the void with Mo Xiaoqi and Aunt Feng.

Mo Xiaoqi looked rather gloomy.

The two Emperor Realm experts ignored her.

From time to time, Uncle Li glanced sideways at Aunt Feng, as if wanting to say something.

"If you want to say something, just say it. Why are you looking at me like that?" Aunt Feng snapped, her beautiful eyes glaring at Uncle Li.

Uncle Li let out an awkward chuckle and said, "I'm just curious. How did that kid break your soul-guiding technique? How much strength did you put into it—ten percent... or five?"

Aunt Feng was silent for a moment, "Twenty percent!"

"Are you kidding me?" Uncle Li's eyes widened.

Aunt Feng said, "That kid's soul power is strange. He only has First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, but his soul strength rivals Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm! And..."

"And what?"

"He seems to have a powerful Secret Treasure for protection... My soul-guiding technique was mostly neutralized by that thing!"

"Even you couldn't tell what Secret Treasure it was?"

"It's hidden within his Sea of Consciousness; unless I split his skull open and take a careful look, there's no way to tell."

"Can you not talk about such scary things? I'm right here, you know." Mo Xiaoqi interjected.

"Besides, that kid..." Aunt Feng ignored Mo Xiaoqi entirely, instead eyeing Uncle Li with clear interest and saying with a playful smile, "His attainments in Spatial Force aren’t low. He can even execute a secret art akin to a black hole. If I remember right, you couldn’t do that back then, could you?"

"What are you trying to say?" Uncle Li glanced at Aunt Feng.

Aunt Feng laughed, "It's rare to meet someone suitable. Haven't you thought about taking him as a disciple? Honestly, this kid is quite good. Even the top sects in the Star Realm might not be able to cultivate someone like him."

"Tch..." Uncle Li sneered, "What's fun about disciples? If I took one, I'd have to teach him, worry about him, fear he'd die young... If he were a beautiful girl, this Lord might consider raising her, but... tsk tsk..."

"He just doesn't have that fortune." Aunt Feng smiled.

"That's right..." Mo Xiaoqi suddenly clapped her hands, "Uncle Li, you're skilled in Spatial Force, and so is Eldest Brother Yang. Why not take him as a disciple so he can inherit your legacy!"

"I refuse!" Uncle Li didn't even think about it.

Mo Xiaoqi glanced at him, then turned to Aunt Feng, "Aunt Feng, when I was four years old, Uncle Li..."

"Aiya..." Uncle Li's expression changed, and he clapped his hands, shouting, "This Lord suddenly feels that taking a disciple is wonderful! When I'm in a good mood, I'll train him; when I'm in a bad mood, I'll train him. The joy of a mischievous disciple!"

"Uncle Li, do you really think so?" Mo Xiaoqi looked at him excitedly.

"Mm... mm..." Uncle Li nodded seriously, "Next time I see him, I'll definitely take him as a disciple!"

At the same time, he thought to himself, "Once this Lord returns, I'll go into seclusion for eight hundred or a thousand years—by then, Xiaoqi will surely have forgotten all about this..."
