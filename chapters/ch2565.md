## Chapter 2565 — All Ruined

The scene was utter chaos, people and beasts thrown everywhere, miserable cries echoing nonstop. Twenty or thirty yao charged forward, but before they could even get close, the myriad sword lights left them flailing helplessly. Many yao were struck dozens or even hundreds of times, their bodies riddled like broken sieves, blood streaming out in torrents.

After that strike, Yang Kai suddenly vanished from where he stood.

Swish—

A shadow flickered, and he had already pounced in front of the charging Yao General, slashing down with his sword.

The Yao General had never encountered such a ferocious person. Seeing his subordinates fall like stalks of grass, he realized things were going badly. This human was nothing like those he’d met before… Wasn’t this one too savage?

Suddenly attacked, he was both shocked and furious.

Still, his reaction was quick. He shook his bone spear, blossoming with spear flowers that thrust straight at Yang Kai. The spear shadows formed a curtain, yao qi surging, the sound of piercing air never ceasing.

Yang Kai swung his sword in rapid succession. Empowered by Emperor Yuan, the Myriad Sword was incomparably sharp, slicing the white bone spear into segments. In the blink of an eye, the Yao General’s spear was reduced to half its original length.

“Ah!” The Yao General cried out in horror. At this point, he knew he’d walked the night road too many times and finally met a ghost.

He’d encountered many human martial artists before, but none had ever left him so powerless. Even those stronger than him would be suppressed in this wild Ancient Land, and with his dozens of subordinates, he was always invincible, killing many and robbing countless human martial artists, making a fortune.

This time, though, he’d kicked an iron plate. Not only did his foot hurt, but if he wasn’t careful, he might lose his life.

Seeing Yang Kai slash down again, the Yao General, terrified, shouted, raised his arms skyward, and lifted the remaining half of his bone spear, pouring in yao yuan to block.

Boom—

Enormous force transmitted down, and the bone spear that had accompanied him through countless battles snapped in two. The sharp sword light nearly grazed his face, sliding all the way down, slicing through his chest and abdomen.

But stung by pain, the steel-backed bristle pig’s eyes suddenly turned crimson. All the bristles on its body, sharp as steel needles, began to quiver wildly, then shot outward with a rapid, whistling sound.

Yang Kai raised his brows, a bit surprised. He hadn’t expected the mount to be more than just for show—it actually had some combat ability.

Without taking the hit head-on, Yang Kai floated back, swinging his broad sword to deflect some of the steel needles coming at him.

Taking advantage, the steel-backed bristle pig suddenly jumped back, pulling the Yao General away from Yang Kai.

Still shaken, the Yao General wiped himself all over, then burst out laughing: “I’m alive! Haha, I’m alive!”

Just a moment ago, he thought he was dead for sure, but unexpectedly, he was unharmed. He felt a sense of relief, as if he’d snatched back his life.

But after this fight, he dared not face Yang Kai again. Knowing he wasn’t a match, he urged his mount to turn and flee. His life was precious; he didn’t dare tangle with Yang Kai any longer, not even caring about his subordinates’ lives.

But after only a few steps, a shadow flashed ahead—Yang Kai had already gotten in front of him.

Black hair flying, eyes cold, Yang Kai said expressionlessly, “You’re alive because I have use for you. Do you know why you escaped death?”

With that, he slashed forward.

The steel-backed bristle pig charging ahead couldn’t dodge and crashed into the sword light. With a shrill beast howl, its massive body split cleanly in two, blood and entrails spilling everywhere. Both halves kept moving forward from inertia.

The Yao General riding its back was thrown off, crashing into a dozen trees before tumbling wretchedly to the base of one, struggling for a long time to get up.

Clang—

A cold light flashed. A broad sword pressed against his brow, startling the Yao General. His eyes crossed, focus scattering, gradually seeing Yang Kai standing above him, looking down.

Cold sweat instantly broke out on his forehead. The Yao General knew Yang Kai hadn’t lied—he was spared only because Yang Kai let him live, not because of his own strength. If this human really wanted his life, it would be as easy as turning a hand.

Gulp—

The sound of swallowing echoed. The Yao General’s face turned pale, forcing a strained smile, abandoning all yao pride, and begged, “Spare me, sir! Spare me!”

Yang Kai wasn’t dealing with yao for the first time. Back in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land on Tongxuan Continent, he’d lived among many yao, knowing they were no different from humans—plenty were greedy and afraid of death.

This one, though possessing Emperor Realm-level cultivation, was clearly a coward.

“Do you want to live or die?” Yang Kai asked coldly, pressing the Myriad Sword forward. A thin line of blood instantly appeared on the Yao General’s forehead, making him tremble all over in terror. “Live! I want to live!” he blurted out desperately.

“If you want to live, answer my questions honestly. If you lie, I’ll kill you on the spot!”

“Ask whatever you wish, sir!” The Yao General dared not move a muscle, lest he lose his head in an instant.

Yang Kai’s face was stern. “Earlier, I heard you mention a crazy woman. Have you seen her?”

The Yao General immediately realized his troubles had come from his own mouth. This human expert was clearly connected to that crazy woman. He swallowed nervously and cautiously asked, “May I ask, sir, is that woman…?”

“Hmm?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened, nostrils flaring as he snorted coldly. “I’m asking the questions. Just answer honestly!”

“Yes, yes!” The Yao General shivered and quickly said, “I’ve seen her—more than once, in fact!”

“What happened? Tell me in detail!”

The demon general’s face immediately turned bitter as he cried out in grief, “My lord, please see reason! That madwoman—ah, cough, cough…” Unsure of Yang Kai’s relationship with that lunatic, he feared that a careless word might earn him a sword through the body. Only after gauging Yang Kai’s expression and seeing no sign of anger did he dare continue. “That woman has truly ruined us! The Heavenly Gang Spirit-Replenishing Fruits I nurtured on my mountain were all stolen by her! Once a month she came to steal—five fruits in total. In less than half a year she wiped them out completely, even uprooting the fruit tree itself! Those were spirit fruits I had been saving for my breakthrough—nurtured for a thousand years! Just when they were about to flower and bear fruit, I didn’t even get to taste a single one! And Old Ox next door—his dozen or so Tortoise-Serpent Grasses were all ripped out by her as well…”

“Who is Old Ox?” Yang Kai frowned.

The Yao General hurriedly replied, “Niu Quan—he’s just like me, a Yao General under Yao King Yingfei. He lives right next door to me.”

“Keep talking!” Yang Kai poked him with his sword, making the Yao General shrink back, wanting to escape but not daring to move.

“Black Crow’s Ten Directions Fruit, Tu Rui’s Golden Rainbow Spring, Zhui Feng’s Royal-grade Pomegranate… all ruined by her. I can name more than a dozen victims, and who knows how many I can’t name. She’s been running wild in this area, and plundered nearly everyone’s valuables. Yao King Yingfei was furious, called us useless for failing to capture a crazy woman, and ordered us to catch her within half a year, lest he lose face before the other Yao Kings.”

Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

He didn’t know who Black Crow, Tu Rui, or Zhui Feng were, but guessed they were similar to the Yao General before him. He was familiar with Ten Directions Fruit and Royal-grade Pomegranate—these were top-tier spiritual medicines.

From the Yao General’s words, it seemed the Third Disciple had ruined many heaven-and-earth treasures guarded by these Yao Generals.

No wonder, despite her muddled mind, the Third Disciple possessed the powerful cultivation of the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. The Ancient Land was full of dangers, but also opportunities. Having ruined so many treasures, her cultivation was bound to rise.

Hearing all this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel both angry and amused.

It felt as if the Ancient Land had become the Third Disciple’s backyard—she went wherever she pleased, took whatever she wanted, leaving the Yao Generals utterly helpless.

“When did all this happen?” Yang Kai asked.

“It’s been like this for fifty years…” The Yao General answered shamefully. A crazy woman had run wild in the Ancient Land for fifty years, and the many yao couldn’t do a thing about it. Truly embarrassing.

Yang Kai twitched his mouth. “You brought these subordinates just to find that crazy woman?”

The Yao General replied, “Yes, yes. My men said they spotted her in this area, so I rushed over, and… ended up in your hands.” Forcing a smile, he cautiously asked, “Sir, what’s your relationship with that woman?”

“None of your business!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

The Yao General shrank his neck, but could tell Yang Kai and the crazy woman were connected—not enemies, otherwise he wouldn’t look so concerned.

His eyes rolled, and he said, “That woman’s movements are unpredictable. We’ve been chasing her for years, but no one has ever caught her. She always escapes… Uh, sir, what are you doing?”

As he spoke, he saw Yang Kai’s eyes turn cold, the sharp sword seeming ready to stab him. His soul nearly fled in terror, knowing his life hung by a thread. He quickly pleaded, “Spare me, sir! I’ll serve you if you let me live!”

“What use are a bunch of yao?” Yang Kai snorted, his hand never stopping. He’d only wanted information about the Third Disciple, and now that he had it, there was no need to spare the Yao General’s life.

Sensing the killing intent, the Yao General’s sweat poured down, his mind racing. He hurriedly said, “I can help you find that woman! I’ve tracked her for fifty years and know a lot about her. Please give me a chance!”
