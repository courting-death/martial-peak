## Chapter 2350 — Time Pill

Ye Hen was already at the end of his rope, his life’s oil nearly spent. The last battle had only worsened his condition, so these words were no exaggeration. If he could break through his shackles and ascend to Emperor before dying, then naturally he would no longer have to worry about his lifespan, and his years would increase. But if he could not ascend, then dust would return to dust, earth to earth.

Now, he only hated that time waited for no one!

But he could not blame anyone else for this; he could only sigh at his own poor luck. If he had met Yang Kai a few years earlier, perhaps he would already be in the Emperor Realm by now.

Yang Kai flipped his palm and took out a jade box, slowly pushing it in front of Ye Hen. He said, “This Spiritual Pill should be of some help to Sect Master Ye.”

“This is…” Ye Hen looked at Yang Kai with suspicion, not knowing why he suddenly took out a Spiritual Pill for him. But he also knew Yang Kai was an Alchemist, so he dared not be careless and hurriedly accepted it, opening the jade box.

Inside the jade box was a Spiritual Pill the size of a longan, flowing with a mysterious radiance. The rich fragrance wafted to his nose, and as Ye Hen inhaled the scent, he was stunned, inexplicably feeling as if he had become much younger.

He blurted out, “Young Master Yang, what kind of pill is this?”

Although he had never seen such a Spiritual Pill before, just the fragrance alone gave him such a feeling, so it was clearly extraordinary. Besides, Yang Kai could even refine heaven-defying things like the Supreme Mystic Pill, so how could this be anything ordinary?

“I wonder if Sect Master Ye has ever heard of the Time Pill?” Yang Kai asked unhurriedly.

“Time Pill?” Ye Hen’s brows shot up, and then his body trembled violently as he cried out, “This is a Time Pill?”

Judging by his reaction, he clearly knew about the Time Pill.

In the Star Realm, there were quite a few treasures that could prolong life, but all of them were legendary and extinct. Let alone Ye Hen, who was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—even those in the Emperor Realm could not obtain them.

Ye Hen knew his end was near and had once thought of seeking out such miraculous Spiritual Pills, but there were no clues to be found. Even if there were, it would never be his turn to search for them; Emperors would have long since fought over them.

So Ye Hen had resigned himself to fate, spending this time in seclusion, comprehending the lost techniques and secret arts he had recovered. He could only hope to break through his shackles and ascend to the Emperor Realm before dying. Even if he could not, he wanted to leave his insights to Ye Qinghan, so she would take fewer detours.

But now, at this very moment, a Time Pill was placed before Ye Hen.

He had thoroughly researched what miraculous Spiritual Pills existed in the Star Realm that could prolong life, so he naturally knew the effects of the Time Pill.

Strictly speaking, the Time Pill did not actually extend one’s lifespan, because it could not increase a person’s years. Its effect was mainly to return the user’s physical state to what it was decades earlier.

In other words, after taking this Time Pill, Ye Hen’s body would revert to how it was decades ago—a kind of indirect life extension. Of course, this reversal had great limitations; it could not erase the injuries one had suffered. If even injuries could be reversed and erased, then the Time Pill’s effect would be far too heaven-defying.

And the Time Pill Yang Kai had produced had at least fifty years of effect!

Ye Hen could hardly believe he would encounter such good fortune. He had just been lamenting that time waited for no one, that he had ambitions but not enough time to realize them, and Yang Kai had given him a Time Pill. For a moment, he was so excited he could hardly contain himself.

He did not doubt Yang Kai, since he knew Yang Kai had once visited the Four Seasons Land and the Time Temple, and that the main ingredient for the Time Pill, the Fruit of Time, came from the Time Temple.

Yang Kai had clearly obtained the Fruit of Time, which was why he could refine this Spiritual Pill.

Although the Time Pill’s effect was only a few decades, for Ye Hen right now, this Pill was the best Spiritual Pill in the world. Even if he had to give up everything, he would be willing to buy it.

Yet Yang Kai had simply gifted it to him—was this not what the world called sending charcoal in the snow?

With this Time Pill, what did he have to worry about? He only needed to go into seclusion for a few years and then attempt to break through to the Emperor Realm. He was ninety percent confident he could succeed. A bright future unfolded before him like a painting; he could already see himself leading the Chiyue Sect back to its former glory.

After a long moment of overwhelming emotion, Ye Hen finally managed to compose himself. Rising to his feet, he bowed deeply to Yang Kai and declared, “I, Ye Hen, have received Young Master Yang’s great kindness time and again, and have no way to repay it. Here and now, I swear this oath: from this day forth, both I and all members of the Chiyue Sect shall regard Young Master Yang as our dearest friend. Should you ever have need of us, we will never refuse. If I break this vow, may heart demons torment me and my Ye Family descendants, burning us to ashes.”

Ye Hen spoke this oath quickly and resolutely, without the slightest hesitation. Before Yang Kai could react, he had already finished swearing.

In the next instant, an invisible force surged into Ye Hen’s body, branding his Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, then gave a wry smile. “Sect Master Ye, there was no need for this.”

He knew exactly what Ye Hen’s oath meant. That was a Heart Demon Oath, sworn on his own Dao Foundation. There was absolutely no way to go back on it. If he ever broke it, he really would be plagued by heart demons and die in agony.

Moreover, this Heart Demon Oath did not just concern him alone—it also included Ye Qinghan and the future descendants of the Ye Family.

The reason Yang Kai had given Ye Hen the Time Pill was mainly because Chi Yue and the others were here. Although the Chiyue Sect’s Heaven Puppets could now be used, their greatest weakness was still the lack of an Emperor Realm master, which made them easy to look down on.

From Chi Yue and the others’ perspective, Yang Kai also hoped Ye Hen could ascend to the Emperor Realm and protect them. That was why, a few days ago, he had refined the Fruit of Time he had obtained into Time Pills, deciding to give one to Ye Hen.

Who would have thought it would earn such a return from Ye Hen?

Ye Hen slowly shook his head. “Young Master Yang has given my Ye Family and the Chiyue Sect a new lease on life. What harm is there in me swearing a little oath? Rest assured, Young Master Yang, I will take good care of Chi Yue and the others. I will not let them come to any harm.”

“Then I must thank Sect Master Ye in advance.” With Ye Hen’s Heart Demon Oath, Yang Kai could finally set his mind at ease. He knew that unless the Chiyue Sect was destroyed, Chi Yue and the others would never be in any danger.

With the Chiyue Sect’s current foundation, unless those top sects personally took action, no one could destroy them.

“By the way, Sect Master Ye, I’d like to ask you about something.” Yang Kai suddenly changed the subject.

Ye Hen said, “If Young Master Yang has any instructions, just say the word.”

“I wonder how much Sect Master Ye knows about a sect called the Netherworld Sect?”

…

Three days later, Yang Kai set out from the Chiyue Sect. After obtaining the Fruit of Time, Ye Hen immediately went into seclusion, eager to refine its medicinal effects and continue comprehending those techniques and secret arts.

Ye Qinghan, Chi Yue, and the others saw Yang Kai off for a thousand li.

Chi Yue and the others were naturally reluctant to part with Yang Kai. After all, it had not been easy to reunite in the Star Realm, and now Yang Kai was leaving again. But everyone knew he was thinking of Xiaoxiao, so they did not try to stop him, only reminding him to be careful in all things.

Yang Kai naturally kept this in mind.

In a stretch of wilderness, Yang Kai stopped and looked at everyone. “You all should head back. I’ll come visit you again another day.”

Ghost Ancestor chuckled, “Sect Master, you must take care of yourself. We’re all waiting for you to found another sect in the Star Realm. When the time comes, we’ll all come help you.”

Yang Kai nodded. “That day will surely come.”

After speaking, he turned to look at Chai Hu, his expression complicated. “Senior Chai Hu, will you do it, or shall I?”

The question seemed out of nowhere, but no one looked surprised. It was as if everyone knew what he meant. Chai Hu sighed softly. “I’ll do it. Sect Master Yang, safe travels.”

“Then let us part here. We will surely meet again someday.” Yang Kai cupped his fists, then summoned his wooden boat and sped off into the distance.

Just then, from behind a small mound nearby, a streak of light suddenly shot out. Wrapped in that light was a delicate figure—a woman. As soon as she appeared, she swung a long sword at Yang Kai, shouting, “I’ll kill you!”

Yang Kai glanced at her indifferently, sighing inwardly. He had no intention of fighting her.

The one who had lain in ambush here, trying to catch him off guard, was none other than Luo Bing!

In just a few months, Luo Bing had lost all her former beauty and innocence. Now, her face was weary, her beautiful eyes dull, her aura unstable, and her clothes no longer bright and clean but dirty and disheveled. Clearly, these months had not been kind to her.

She was Luo Jin’s daughter. When Luo Jin ruled Tianhe City, he had done many evil deeds. Now that Luo Jin was dead, those who had suffered under him naturally sought revenge on Luo Bing.

With Luo Jin dead, of course they would come after Luo Bing.

Fortunately, Luo Bing was not a bad person. Some of the City Lord’s mansion guards were loyal to her and helped her escape Tianhe City. But she had been on the run ever since, never knowing a moment’s peace. She had once been the little princess of Tianhe City, pampered and privileged, but now her life had gone from heaven to hell overnight, leaving her at a loss.

Who knows where she had heard the news that her father died at Yang Kai’s hands? She had lain in ambush here, wanting to kill Yang Kai to avenge Luo Jin.

But her cultivation was only at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, while everyone with Yang Kai was at the Dao Origin Realm. As soon as they arrived, they sensed her presence. No one exposed her because they all knew who she was.

The sword light was bright, but Luo Bing’s strike carried no killing intent. Her beautiful eyes were filled with despair. She clearly knew that, with her strength, killing Yang Kai was impossible.

She had lain in ambush here, most likely just seeking death, hoping Yang Kai would kill her in anger.

But she never expected Yang Kai to merely glance at her and ignore her.
