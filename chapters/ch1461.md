## Chapter 1461 — Ice Phoenix Reappears

After all, the Demon Blood Threads technique can shatter the Shi of Origin Returning Realm experts; its power is considerable, but as with most high-powered secret arts, it comes with many restrictions — the number of Demon Blood Threads is the greatest constraint on this technique.

Yet the Demon Blood Sect’s beautiful Sect Master had somehow cultivated two Demon Blood Threads. From the aura they emitted, the two threads were of equal potency, and she herself displayed abundant Qi and blood with no sign of any depletion; it was truly puzzling how she had managed it.

From this alone, it was clear she deserved her position as Sect Master; she indeed possessed genuine ability.

The two Demon Blood Threads, the moment she shot them out, writhed and twisted, exuding a mass of blood-red mist from within before transforming into two little blood-red snakes.

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened as he watched, involuntarily revealing a look of excitement.

His Golden Blood Threads could not achieve anything like this. It seemed his earlier guess was correct: the Demon Blood Threads technique still held much exploitable potential.

He had managed to cultivate Golden Blood Threads only because, when leaving the Flowing Flame Sandland that year, he stepped in to help a Demon Blood Sect disciple named Deng Ning and obtained the upper half of the Demon Blood Threads technique from him. Though only half, it had not hindered his cultivation.

Yang Kai had long suspected that the lower half of the technique described how to flexibly employ the Demon Blood Threads and the many transformations tied to them.

Now it seemed his suspicion was confirmed. Of course, as a secret technique jealously guarded by the Demon Blood Sect, the lower half could never fall into the hands of an outsider like Yang Kai.

Seeing the method of transformation of the Demon Blood Threads now, Yang Kai was naturally delighted.

Since cultivating the Golden Blood Threads, the technique had helped him many times, playing a huge role in numerous fights. If he could truly fathom the hidden mysteries of the lower half, the technique’s power would grow even greater.

These thoughts flashed through Yang Kai’s mind, and the two little blood-red snakes seized the moment of the white rabbit’s distraction to pounce, opening their mouths to reveal fangs — one bit down on the rabbit’s head, the other on its tail, refusing to let go.

From those fangs poured a blood-red energy that was injected into the white rabbit’s body, as if attempting to contaminate its spiritual power.

The Heaven and Earth Spirit was taken by surprise by the sudden assault and visibly shaken; when it recovered from Jin Shi’s attack, it found itself beset from front and rear and flew into a rage. It thrashed head and tail, yet no matter how it struggled it could not shake off the two blood snakes’ entanglement.

Worse, in that brief instant the two blood snakes poured even more blood-red energy into the white rabbit, leaving it somewhat dazed.

The Heaven and Earth Spirit realized the situation had turned bad and dared not remain where it was; with a flicker its rabbit form collapsed, dispersing into streams of pure, icy cold energy as it sought to flee.

A tinkling, clear laugh rang out, imbued with a soul-stealing force that sent the blood of everyone present surging and stirred a commotion deep within their hearts.

The Demon Blood Sect’s beautiful Sect Master hovered in midair and simply flicked a finger. Without a trace of mundane effort, the two blood snakes transformed back into two Demon Blood Threads, which immediately intertwined and then split apart into more, thinner blood-red filaments.

Those blood-red filaments darted and braided with one another at high speed, quickly forming a vast blood-red net that descended upon the Heaven and Earth Spirit.

The Heaven and Earth Spirit had nowhere to dodge and was struck squarely by that blood-red net.

“Retract!” the beautiful Sect Master cried, and with a thought the blood-red net suddenly contracted, tightly choking the Heaven and Earth Spirit; no matter how it thrashed left and right, it could not break free from the net’s restraint.

In an instant, it became the woman’s captive.

A smile lingered at the woman’s lips, a hint of small triumph on her face; she beckoned toward the blood net and it, as if possessed of spirit, drifted gently to her.

At that moment a sharp phoenix cry suddenly sliced through the air, and an appalling power that made one shiver descended from the sky; whether the two women of Ice Heart Valley, already badly wounded and collapsed, or the swaggering Jin Shi and the beautiful woman, all of them went pale and stared about in horror.

Behind an iceberg, a great bird more than ten zhang long, its body immaculate as if carved from ice and jade, rose into the air. The bird had no true substance, only an illusory projection, yet even so it commanded disdainful majesty, as if finding the world beneath contempt; its birdlike eyes held inexhaustible authority.

Anyone who met its gaze could not help but feel as insignificant as an ant.

“Ice Phoenix!” the two women of Ice Heart Valley gasped, nearly popping their eyes out as they cried the name of the great bird; shock gave way to fanatic fervor in their beautiful eyes.

There was no other reason: Ice Heart Valley cultivated ice-based techniques, and in this world the Ice Phoenix was the ancient being most versed in ice principles. The Ice Phoenix was the totem worshipped by the valley’s disciples.

But they had only ever seen it as a pattern, never an actual Ice Phoenix. Though the bird before them was not a true Ancient Divine Spirit, it nonetheless bore a connection to that transcendent existence.

In the space of a few heartbeats the two women had experienced wild swings of fortune: first thinking they would die beneath the Heaven and Earth Spirit’s assault, then being rescued at the critical moment by someone who used a powerful secret art to subdue the ice-aligned Heaven and Earth Spirit — and before they could fully recover, an image of an Ice Phoenix had manifested here.

The two were filled with complicated emotions; they had never expected so many outsiders to be watching while they faced the Heaven and Earth Spirit.

Trembling in their hearts, they also secretly rejoiced — in any case, they were alive.

Their eyes trembled as they gazed at the Ice Phoenix, a strange radiance appearing on their faces.

With a cry, the Ice Phoenix left behind a trailing afterimage and vanished, only to reappear between the Demon Blood Sect’s beautiful Sect Master and the blood-netted Heaven and Earth Spirit; it opened its beak and pecked at the trapped Heaven and Earth Spirit.

The motion was as though it were pecking at a trivial insect, elegant and nonchalant.

The woman was clearly taken aback — after all, an Ice Phoenix was not something one met every day — but she quickly recovered and snapped, “You are courting death!”

Whether it was truly an Ice Phoenix or not, the fact that it dared to covet her prey was something the beautiful woman could never tolerate. With a sharp shout, she waved her hand and summoned a bracelet-shaped Secret Treasure, hurling it straight toward the Ice Phoenix’s remnant soul.

The bracelet, once launched, suddenly split into two, then into three, and in the blink of an eye became a skyfull of bracelet images that swarmed to envelop the Ice Phoenix’s remnant soul.

The Ice Phoenix paid them no mind. Though it was only a remnant soul, it would not be casually destroyed.

As the legion of bracelet images descended, the Ice Phoenix swallowed the blood net into its belly, then spread its wings and drew upon the dense ice-cold energy here, turning it into countless ice blades that circled its form.

Clang, clang...

A dense clamor filled the air as bracelet images shattered and ice blades collapsed; when the bracelet finally returned to the woman’s hand, the Ice Phoenix was utterly unharmed, while the woman’s pretty face had gone deathly pale.

Not only had the Ice Phoenix swallowed the Heaven and Earth Spirit, it had not spared her Demon Blood Threads either.

In that brief interval she already felt the connection between her Demon Blood Threads and her mind grow markedly weak; if it continued she would likely lose her Demon Blood Threads.

“Dare to steal? Let’s see if you can swallow it!” the beautiful woman shouted sharply. Her hand seals shifted rapidly as she urged her Demon Blood Threads to strike from within the Ice Phoenix’s body.

Though they had only clashed for a single move, the woman’s eye could tell that this Ice Phoenix was only a projection and not a true Ancient Divine Spirit; otherwise she would never have dared tarry here but would have fled long ago.

A true Ancient Divine Spirit would utterly crush even Void King Realm experts before it.

As she urged her force, the Ice Phoenix emitted a pained cry; its white surface faintly reflected a tinge of crimson, giving it an eerie air.

Yang Kai could no longer keep hidden. From the instant the Ice Phoenix charged out he had prepared to act; hearing its cry he immediately rushed out with Biluo.

“So it was you, brat!” Jin Shi sprang forward from the side, intercepting Yang Kai and blocking his path, his face contorted with rage and ill intent.

Yang Kai did not move; he only gave Jin Shi a cold look before returning his gaze to the Ice Phoenix.

He could not command the Ice Phoenix to do anything — its remnant soul was merely using his body as a temporary vessel; otherwise he could have ordered it directly. He was anxious, fearing some mishap might befall the Ice Phoenix here.

Fortunately, though only a remnant soul, the Ice Phoenix understood the word "restraint."

After a sharp episode of cries it opened its beak and spat out a ball of blood-red light that split and reformed into two Demon Blood Threads, which returned to the woman’s hand.

After all, the Demon Blood Threads was a secret the Demon Blood Sect had spent countless years refining; it was not something easily digested.

Having expelled the Demon Blood Threads, the Ice Phoenix let out a long cry and transformed into a white light that shot into Yang Kai’s body and disappeared.

Having swallowed a Heaven and Earth Spirit, it was content and needed to refine it quickly to strengthen itself; the rest of the fight was no concern of its own.

At the instant the Ice Phoenix entered his body, Yang Kai shuddered, feeling an intense chill surge through him — fortunately the cold did not affect him too severely, or he would have been forced to flee.

The rapid sequence of events occurred in the span of a flash; most people barely had time to react.

The two Ice Heart Valley women, collapsed and bloodied at the side and only able to protect themselves, looked on with interest when they saw the Ice Phoenix willingly dive into Yang Kai’s body; they wondered what kind of absurd fortune this man possessed to obtain such a thing.

If that Ice Phoenix could be made theirs…

The enchanting Sect Master of the Demon Blood Sect was seething with rage, her silver teeth clenched tight, eyes blazing as she glared at Yang Kai.
