## Chapter 521 — Artistic Conception

All the onlooking martial artists bore extremely pained expressions under this overwhelming force.

Suddenly, even breathing became difficult for them, as though a towering mountain pressed down on their heads, causing their knees to weaken and the urge to collapse to the ground.

Only the Earth Demon sneered wickedly, his eyes shining with delight and enjoyment.

Such a wild and evil aura was exactly the power he craved.

"Hurry and dodge!"

"Stay away from that black qi!"

"How is this possible? How can this young master wield such immense power? Am I seeing things wrong?"

The warriors at Yang Zhao’s residence cried out desperately, their eyes filled with disbelief and fear, hastily avoiding the black energy, afraid of being corrupted by it.

A world-shaking power suddenly burst forth from the Black Jiao’s body. Within its gaping blood-red maw, a black vortex appeared, swirling and generating an incomparable suction force, pulling Yang Zhao and his surrounding Blood Servants inward.

Under this force, Yang Zhao barely had the strength to resist. Were it not for the Blood Servants' protection, he would have long since been pulled into the Jiao’s mouth and torn to pieces.

His face drained of color, Yang Zhao realized for the first time just how immense the gap was between his strength and that of Ninth Brother.

It was the distance between heaven and earth; no matter how hard he worked in his lifetime, he would never catch up to Ninth Brother's pace.

At this thought, Yang Zhao felt utterly despondent. He suddenly questioned the point in struggling in the Succession War, even his position as head of the Yang Family.

"Second Young Master!" A Blood Servant roared in his ear, and Yang Zhao’s eyes, previously dazed, flashed with a sudden alertness.

"Do not let this aura affect your mind!" the Blood Servant warned gravely.

Sweat poured from Yang Zhao’s forehead as he hurriedly nodded. He was not a man to surrender lightly. Those earlier feelings of despair were purely the result of being influenced by Yang Kai’s strange power.

After the Blood Servant’s shout, he steadied his mind, refusing to let the artistic conception infused within Yang Kai’s power continue to cloud him.

"Yuxian!" Yang Kai also roared.

Tang Yuxian, trembling in the sky as she fought another Blood Servant loyal to Yang Zhao, smiled at her opponent. Suddenly, a powerful, pure Divine Sense burst forth from her mind, invisible yet forceful, crashing toward Yang Zhao’s side.

"Divine Roaming Realm, Ninth Stage?" The Blood Servant facing Tang Yuxian’s eyes widened in shock.

"Ahh, you noticed," Tang Yuxian chuckled. "I planned to hide it for a while longer."

"How is that possible?" The Blood Servant scrutinized Tang Yuxian as though rediscovering her. "How could you possibly advance to Divine Roaming Realm, Ninth Stage so quickly?"

Blood Servants were like siblings, intimately familiar with each other. This Blood Servant knew Tang Yuxian’s level well and also knew precisely when she should have been able to reach the Ninth Stage.

Yet now, with this sudden outburst of Divine Sense power, he realized she truly had advanced.

"How did you do it?" he asked eagerly. Once, his own aptitude was on par with hers—now this woman had surged ahead, leaving him both happy and impatient.

Happy that another sibling had ascended within the Blood Servants' Hall; impatient because he was falling behind.

"Not telling you!" Tang Yuxian giggled.

The man shook his head and smiled bitterly, "Yu Xian, it seems being by the young master’s side has rejuvenated your spirit—you never used to be so playful."

Tang Yuxian’s face darkened. Coldly, she said, "What do you mean? Are you implying I was old before?"

The man’s heart skipped a beat as he realized he had touched a taboo. He hurriedly waved his hands, "Yuxian, I didn't mean that!"

"Hmph! I wasn’t going to let you off easy, but now I’m ready to teach you a lesson!" Tang Yuxian frowned in annoyance and struck without mercy, forcing her opponent to cry out in pain.

Though only a one-tier difference separated them, it was that very difference that allowed Tang Yuxian to surpass her opponent.

During the fight, Tang Yuxian continuously released her Divine Soul skills to assist Yang Kai’s side.

Thanks to Tang Yuxian’s aid, the situation at Yang Kai’s side became increasingly manageable.

"Young Master, excuse me!" one of the Blood Servants guarding Yang Zhao suddenly roared, releasing Yang Zhao and channeling his True Yuan. Streams of green light burst forth from his body, forming a colossal pillar of light that fiercely shot toward Yang Kai.

"Crack!"

Before the light could reach Yang Kai, he extended a finger and released a black energy blast that intercepted and shattered it midair.

Even though the attack from Yang Family’s Blood Servants wasn’t full power, it was terrifyingly strong—yet it was easily broken by Yang Kai’s strike.

Everyone was shocked, utterly uncertain how strong Yang Kai’s combat ability had become at this moment.

Yet Yang Kai himself, despite his surging qi and blood, frowned deeply.

A direct clash with the Blood Servants made him realize it was impossible to defeat them.

Yang Family’s Blood Servants were not overrated. Even with his current Demonic State and Tang Yuxian’s support, he could not defeat them.

Or rather, if he were not protecting Yang Zhao now, Yang Kai might already have been defeated!

One-on-one, he was still no match for a Blood Servant.

His mind raced with countless thoughts. Yang Kai snorted coldly as the black Jiao and all its evil energy returned, enveloping him tightly.

With a flick of his wrist, a small sword shining with dazzling light appeared in his palm.

This was the Heaven-Grade Upper-Level Divine Soul Treasure!

Ever since practicing with it, Yang Kai had never felt fully fused with it. But now, to defeat Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng, he had no choice but to use it. Success or failure would be decided in this moment!

Casting a distant glance behind Yang Zhao, Yang Kai saw both Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng lurking within the crowd, their faces twisted with hatred and malice.

"I’ve said it, none of you will be spared today. You will all die without doubt!"

Standing firm, Yang Kai roared, his eyes flashing with icy sharpness.

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng shuddered and suddenly felt a wave of unease. Instinctively, they sought protection.

Unfortunately, all experts from the Xiang and Nan Families had been hunted down and killed by Yang Kai during the pursuit. The two Divine Roaming Realm peak warriors who had fought Ying Jiu after the battle still had not returned.

After searching for a long time, they found no one strong enough to rely on. Facing Yang Kai’s cold gaze and fierce warning, a dreadful feeling welled up within them.

Yang Kai’s behavior was beyond their expectations. They never imagined he would dare chase Yang Zhao’s household and openly clash here, showing no respect to anyone—resolute to kill both of them before stopping.

"We are heirs to first-class families. Yang Kai, if you dare to kill us, you will regret it!" Nan Sheng screamed hysterically in panic.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head coldly, "I care not if you are heirs of noble families. If you injure me in fair combat, I will accept it. But if you use dirty tricks behind my back, you will pay the price!"

With that, he suddenly closed his eyes.

Clang—

A crisp, pleasant chime rang from the small sword in his hand, as if being gently plucked.

A strange aura spread from Yang Kai’s body.

"Stop him quickly!" Yang Zhao sensed danger and shouted as he activated his own Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure.

It was a golden, ring-shaped treasure he had won during the treasure hunt at Po Jing Lake.

Frantically, he poured True Yuan into the ring, then casually sent it flying. Mid-flight, the ring suddenly split into two, then four, then eight...

In the blink of an eye, countless golden rings filled the sky, encasing Yang Kai.

The Jiao roared furiously, swaying its massive body to shield Yang Kai closely, forming an impenetrable barrier.

"Tyrant Blood Fury Technique!" Tang Yuxian descended from the sky, her delicate figure emanating unimaginable power, standing resolute before Yang Kai.

Two Blood Servants loyal to Yang Zhao also charged forward.

Fierce attacks rained down on Tang Yuxian.

The battlefield descended into chaos.

Yet Yang Kai’s heart was calm as still water; the clamor of battle, the roar of wild power explosions, all faded like passing wind. He seemed to stand on a peaceful lake’s surface.

Tick-tock...

A stirring rose in his heart. For some reason, his Divine Sense and the small sword-shaped Divine Soul Treasure achieved an unprecedented harmony at this moment.

It was as if Yang Kai’s own being merged into the little sword.

Whoosh—

The small sword transformed into a streak of light, shooting from Yang Kai’s hand at an impossible speed, invisible even to Divine Sense.

Consciousness residing within the sword, Yang Kai witnessed Tang Yuxian still fighting fiercely after deploying the Blood Fury Technique against two Divine Roaming Realm, Eighth Stage Blood Servants—her fragrant sweat shining, undaunted.

He saw the Black Jiao near him, badly wounded and black smoke billowing, struck by Yang Zhao’s Mystery-Grade treasure.

He saw the astonished expressions of the onlookers.

He even saw his own image reflected in Qiu Yimeng’s eyes, alongside the worry hidden in her beautiful gaze.

Furthermore, several hundred zhang away, at a teahouse by the window, Yang Wei and Liu Qingyao watched with grave expressions.

Time seemed to slow at this moment. Yang Kai’s thoughts clarified beyond measure; everything within reach of his mind was imprinted clearly.

A wondrous, mysterious feeling rose spontaneously from his heart—something never felt before—filling him with exhilarating joy.

Boom—

A binding in his mind seemed to shatter, suddenly making him feel light and free, as if the vast sea allowed fish to leap and the endless sky permitted birds to soar.

The small sword-shaped Divine Soul Treasure sped up even more!

Above, the converging clouds thickened, enveloping the Entire War City in oppressive darkness, heavier and more stifling than before.

Yang Kai had already immersed himself in this self-forgetful artistic conception, locking his target on Nan Sheng.
