## Chapter 11 — Good to the End, Send the Buddha to the West

This Lingxiao Pavilion disciple who suddenly stepped out of the crowd circled the two burly men several times. His expression was rather cynical, and his eyes gradually filled with mockery.

The two burly men noticed the unwelcome visitor and furrowed their brows. The stronger one with a ring around his eye glared fiercely and shouted, “You little brat, spinning around like this is making me dizzy. What do you want?”

The youth chuckled and stood before them, giving a deep look to the “poisoned” man. He said, “That pale face… looks like the poisoning is severe.”

“Indeed.” The one supporting the weak man struck at him like a snake hitting with a stick, his expression vicious. “If it weren’t so, my brother and I wouldn’t risk our lives coming here instead of seeking medical help. We came to expose this heartless merchant, so the neighbors know his true face and won’t buy rice here anymore.”

Boss He’s face turned pale; he had no idea what these two wanted. He could understand if they were here to extort money, but these accusations made no sense.

While deep in thought, Yang Kai quietly asked, “Uncle He, have you offended anyone lately?”

Boss He thought hard, his face gloomy, “No.”

“Then maybe your rice shop blocked someone’s profits?” Though young, Yang Kai had seen enough of the world’s scheming. He quickly thought of this possibility.

“A small business—what profits could it block?” Boss He shook his head repeatedly.

This was odd! Yang Kai squinted at the scene, trying to make sense but still puzzled.

In the center, the Lingxiao Pavilion youth sneered after asking a question and shouted to the pale-faced man, “Take this!”

He immediately executed a Black Tiger Heart-Piercing Strike, aiming directly for the poisoned man’s chest.

A surprising thing happened: the weak man who had been moaning as if halfway to the gates of death suddenly nimbly jumped back like a swift hare, calm yet agile.

His pale face instantly flushed rosy red.

The crowd gasped, shocked by this sudden transformation.

“Poisoned, huh?” The Lingxiao Pavilion youth mocked the two men. “Poisoned but still this agile? I’m impressed.”

The two men, exposed by this move, looked pale and flushed in turn, as if really poisoned.

The crowd hissed. They were not fools; everyone saw the truth. These two men, for unknown reasons, pretended to be poisoned to slander the He Rice Shop, only to be exposed by the Lingxiao Pavilion youth.

The place filled with disdain for the two men and praise for the youth, who was already quite likable. Now his reputation as a young hero was sealed.

Yang Kai faintly sensed this was a double act: playing the part of a chivalrous hero helping the weak, then taking advantage of gratitude! Had he not noticed them together in the alley earlier, he might have been fooled too.

But what was their real motive?

The two men could no longer pretend and glared hatefully at the Lingxiao Pavilion youth, “Who are you? How dare you meddle in my brother’s affairs?”

The youth, graceful and proud, said, “I am Su Mu, disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion!”

Hearing those three words, one man visibly hesitated, his face strained. “So you’re from Lingxiao Pavilion—no wonder you look like a dragon among men. My brother and I admit defeat today. I’ll remember you. Fate willing, we shall meet again!”

Their words sounded rehearsed, and Yang Kai found it amusing.

Su Mu sneered, “Good riddance. No need to see you off.”

If nothing changed, the two men would leave, and Su Mu would receive praise from the crowd and thanks from Boss He.

But Yang Kai did not want Boss He to be kept in the dark. Before the men left, he shouted, “Don’t let them go! Such villains use vile tricks, falsely accuse honest merchants. Today it’s He Rice Shop; if we don’t teach them a lesson, tomorrow it might be Liu’s Tailor Shop or Jiang’s Grocery Store.”

Most watchers were nearby shop owners. Originally spectators, they suddenly felt a pang of worry—how could these scoundrels be allowed to leave so easily? If they left today, tomorrow they might come to their shops and cause trouble. They wouldn’t be so lucky to have someone defend them like Boss He.

With that thought, those about to step aside immediately stood firm, their expressions hostile as they looked at the two men.

Yang Kai clearly saw a flash of surprise and panic in Su Mu’s eyes. At that moment, Su Mu looked toward Yang Kai’s voice, and their eyes met. Su Mu quickly adjusted his expression.

Yang Kai smiled lightly, pushing him forward: “Brother, as the saying goes, good deeds should be done thoroughly—send the Buddha all the way to the West. Why don’t we work together to catch these two?”

Su Mu was annoyed. Yang Kai looked fragile and called him brother, and his plan was disrupted. “Who’s your brother?”

“I’m also a Lingxiao Pavilion disciple, have been for over three years.”

Su Mu was speechless—this really was his senior brother.

“Enough talk.” Yang Kai stepped forward with righteous solemnity. “In our world, the most important thing is chivalry. To act with justice is our duty. Junior brother, don’t let senior brother take all the credit. Today, let us join forces to capture these two despicable villains, give Boss He justice, and restore peace to Wumei Town.”

His words earned loud cheers. Su Mu was troubled, feeling dragged into trouble by this stranger senior brother, now unable to back out.

The two men glanced over nervously. Su Mu glanced back, feeling guilty.

“Junior brother, let’s go!” Yang Kai grabbed Su Mu’s shoulder and charged straight ahead.

What a mess! Su Mu wanted to cry but had no tears. Where did this brother come from to ruin everything? But having come this far, Su Mu could do nothing but follow, charging at the men while signaling them to hold back and wait for an opportunity to release them.

The two men nodded slightly. Yang Kai saw this and grew more certain of his suspicions.

Boss He, worried Yang Kai would be hurt, grabbed a weight and rushed over, shouting, “Neighbors and friends, old and young, don’t just watch the show, come help these two young brothers!”

With Boss He leading, the shop assistant yelled loyalty, holding an empty cloth bag, rushing forward. He was ready to take revenge after being kicked by one of the men.

Encouraged, the crowd stopped watching and surged forward. In no time, He’s Rice Shop was packed, bustling with noise.

The two men, previously indifferent, turned pale in fear at this scene and only managed to say, “Don’t hit our faces!” before crouching and covering their heads.
