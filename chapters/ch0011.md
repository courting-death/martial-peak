## Chapter 11 — See Good Through to the End, Escort the Buddha All the Way West

The Lingxiao Pavilion disciple who suddenly stepped out from the crowd circled around the two burly men several times, his expression somewhat cynical, his gaze gradually turning mocking.

The two burly men saw that the newcomer bore ill intent and furrowed their brows tightly. The man supporting the other flashed a fierce glance and shouted angrily, "You brat, you keep circling around and giving me a headache. What do you want?"

The youth chuckled lightly, standing before them, and took a deep look at the man who appeared poisoned. Then he said, "This pale and bluish complexion… it seems the poison runs deep."

"Indeed." The man supporting his brother took the opportunity, his face devilish and scowling, saying, "If it weren’t so, how could the two of us not have sought medical help? We risked our lives coming here just to expose this black-hearted boss, so that the neighbors would know his true colors and never buy rice from him again."

Owner He’s face turned pale; he had no idea what these two were up to. If they were here to extort money, he could understand, but this framing was truly baffling and beyond comprehension.

While still pondering, Yang Kai whispered from the side, "Uncle He, have you offended anyone lately?"

Owner He thought hard, his face mournful. "No."

"Then your rice shop must have blocked someone’s profits," Yang Kai said. Though young, he had seen much treachery in the mortal world and immediately considered this possibility.

"A small business, how could it block someone’s income?" Owner He shook his head repeatedly.

This was odd! Yang Kai squinted towards the scene, mentally weighing the possibilities, though he still found it hard to make sense of the matter.

In the center of the scene, after asking one question, the Lingxiao Pavilion youth suddenly sneered coldly and shouted fiercely at the pale man, "Take this!"

At the same time, he unleashed a move named Black Tiger Heart Snatch, thrusting straight towards the poisoned man’s heart.

What happened next was astonishing: the man who had been weak and moaning continuously, as if one step from the gates of hell, nimbly leapt backward with agility—embodying the calm stillness of a maiden and the swift motion of a startled hare.

With that movement, his pale complexion instantly vanished, replaced by a healthy rosy flush.

The crowd gasped in surprise, clearly shocked by this sudden transformation.

"Poisoned, huh?" The Lingxiao Pavilion youth mocked the two burly men, "Poisoned but still such skillful maneuvers, I must say I am impressed."

The two men, their scheme exposed, paled and flushed in turn, as if they truly had been poisoned.

The onlookers hissed in disdain. They were no fools; they could see the truth here. These two men, for some unknown reason, had pretended to be poisoned to slander He Family Rice Shop, only to be unmasked by this Lingxiao Pavilion youth.

For a while, the scene was filled with contempt directed at the two men and praise for the Lingxiao Pavilion youth, whose handsome face already made him likable. Now, the reputation of the young hero was firmly established.

Yang Kai subtly realized this was a double act—a play of chivalry, righteous revenge, and then owing favors! If he hadn’t accidentally seen them together in the alley when he arrived, he might have fallen for their scheme too.

But why such a commotion, after all?

The two burly men could no longer pretend and glared viciously at the Lingxiao Pavilion youth, saying, "Boy, who are you? How dare you meddle in my brother’s affairs."

The Lingxiao Pavilion youth carried an air of elegance and pride, saying, "I am Su Mu, a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion."

At the mention of Lingxiao Pavilion, one of the burly men appeared quite apprehensive and said with difficulty, "So you are a Lingxiao Pavilion disciple. No wonder you’re a dragon among men. Today, my brother and I admit defeat. Boy, I’ll remember you. Fate willing, we shall meet again!”

Their words sounded rehearsed, and Yang Kai wanted to laugh listening to them.

Su Mu sneered, "Begone. No need to see you off.”

With things unfolding thus far, if nothing changed, these two men would leave and Su Mu would surely receive the crowd’s praise, especially Owner He’s gratitude.

But Yang Kai did not want Owner He to remain in the dark. Before the two left, he hurriedly shouted, "Don’t let them go. Such despicable men slander an honest merchant. Today it’s He Family Rice Shop, but if they go unpunished, tomorrow it could be Liu’s Tailor Shop or Jiang’s Grocery Store."

Most of the onlookers were local shop owners nearby, originally just watching the spectacle. Hearing this, they were struck to the core. Indeed, how could they let these scoundrels leave so easily? If they got away today, tomorrow who knew if they would come wreak havoc in their shops, causing both financial losses and ruining reputations. No one could guarantee such mercy as Owner He’s.

With this thought, people who were about to part stopped in their tracks and glared fiercely at the two burly men.

Yang Kai clearly saw a flicker of astonishment and panic in Su Mu’s eyes. At that moment, Su Mu turned towards Yang Kai’s voice. Their eyes met; Yang Kai instantly composed himself.

Yang Kai smiled lightly, pushing Su Mu into a tight spot: "Junior Brother, as the saying goes, see good through to the end; escort the Buddha all the way West. Why don’t you and I work together to capture these two scoundrels?"

Su Mu, seeing Yang Kai’s slight build and feeble appearance, howlingly called him Junior Brother and disrupted his plans, was irritated: "Junior Brother? Who are you calling Junior Brother?"

Yang Kai said, "I’m also a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, having been enrolled in the Sect for more than three years."

Su Mu was speechless. Turns out this was really his Senior Brother.

"Enough chatter." Yang Kai stepped forward with righteous fervor: "We who roam the martial world must uphold chivalry. Acting with justice is our duty. Senior Brother can’t let Junior Brother be the only one to shine. Today, let us brothers join hands to subdue these two despicable men, restore justice to Owner He, and bring a clear sky to Wumei Town."

This speech drew a surge of cheers from the crowd. Su Mu was full of worries, feeling he’d been dragged onto a sinking ship by a strange Senior Brother. Now that he was here, there was no turning back.

The two burly men glanced this way, making Su Mu uneasy.

"Junior Brother, let’s go!" Yang Kai grabbed Su Mu’s shoulder and charged straight in.

What the hell was this? Su Mu could only cry silently. Where did this Senior Brother suddenly spring from, ruining everything? But since it had come to this, Su Mu could do nothing but charge forward, signaling to the two men to stay calm and promising he would find a chance to let them go.

The two men nodded slightly—everything was observed by Yang Kai, only strengthening his suspicions.

On the other side, Owner He, worried that Yang Kai might suffer, grabbed a weight and rushed over shouting, "Neighbors, young masters, stop watching and help these two young men!"

Owner He also stepped forward. The rice shop’s errand boy shouted loyally, carrying an empty sack as he charged up. Earlier, one of these men had kicked him, and now he sought revenge.

With Owner He's lead, the crowd no longer merely watched; they swarmed forward, filling the area before He Family Rice Shop with bustling activity.

The two men had not cared much before but now saw the scene and turned pale with fear. They barely got out a warning, "Don’t hit our faces!" before crouching down with their hands over their heads.
