## Chapter 757 — Ancient Saint Pill

Watching An Ling'er's mixture of bashfulness and anger, Yang Kai laughed heartily, a spontaneous lightness filling his chest. "How do you feel, Your Highness?"

As he spoke, he deliberately blew a warm breath against her delicate earlobe; An Ling'er's ear reddened as if dyed, blooming a vivid flush while her heart beat like a drum.

The Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had been raised and cultivated within the Sacred Land since childhood; from the moment she could understand, one doctrine had been instilled in her.

That doctrine was that her life belonged to the Saint Lord; everything she had existed for his sake.

In the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, the Saintess was a symbol of nobility and purity, and had never before been intimate with any man.

Feeling the strength and vigor of that body pressed against her, An Ling'er's mind spun; she inwardly regretted having provoked such a villain.

Yet this villain had, against all odds, passed her test and instantaneously comprehended three moves of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique.

The heavens must be blind! An Ling'er bit her lip hard and fell silent.

Seeing her look of grievance, Yang Kai ceased his teasing but maintained the situation, continuing to soar upward.

After a long time the two burst through the surface and returned above the sea.

An Ling'er, like a frightened rabbit, hastily disentangled herself from Yang Kai and gasped, fixing him with a profoundly aggrieved look.

"I solemnly tell you this: regarding what happened under the sea, you had better not mention it before the people of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, or I'll truly silence you. I can also promise I will not harm your Sacred Land, nor will I spread your secrets. As I said before, it's best for us to part ways to the ends of the earth and corners of the seas, never to meet again. That's better for both of us." Yang Kai warned seriously.

"I understand. I won't mention it," An Ling'er nodded slightly.

"Farewell then. May you soon find your Saint Lord!" Yang Kai flashed a brilliant smile and departed quickly.

Watching his retreating figure, An Ling'er's expression turned complicated.

She had never imagined anyone would refuse a gift delivered to their door; she had always thought that when she found her Saint Lord he would be overjoyed and eager to take her back to the Sacred Land to enjoy worldly riches, but Yang Kai's reaction shattered that assumption.

He left without a trace of lingering, decisive and swift—clearly unwilling to be Saint Lord.

"Oh no!" An Ling'er was startled again, suddenly remembering how long she'd been missing; she feared Qian Shu and the others must have been frantic.

On the islands the mood was tense and chaotic.

Over the past month the people of the Seven Families Alliance and the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had combed twenty‑three nearby isles from top to bottom.

Yet they could not locate the missing Saintess.

Facing the wrath of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, each family within the Seven Families Alliance trembled in fear.

The leaders of the Seven Families had gathered within a palace that had once housed the Sacred Land's temporary guests; it was now thick with tension.

Qian Ning's face darkened to an extreme as he looked at the seven family leaders and hissed in a low voice, "It's been over a month and there's still no sign of the Saintess. I'll give you three days—if I don't see her by then, I'll flatten all your islands!"

"Protector Qian, please calm your anger. We'll dispatch more people and will find the Saintess, I swear!" a First Stage of the Transcendent Realm warrior stammered, continuously wiping cold sweat from his brow.

The arrival of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's delegation had once been a tremendous honor for the Seven Families Alliance; who could have predicted such a turn of events that now implicated them as well?

"Protector Qian, might the Saintess have gone under the sea with that earlier group?" someone suggested.

"Under the sea?" Qian Ning snorted coldly. "How could the Saintess do such a reckless thing?"

"But we've searched everywhere except below the waves…"

"Those who went under the sea returned three days ago; they found no trace of the Saintess. If she had gone, she would have returned too."

"Yet many casualties occurred down there. Could the Saintess have…"

"Enough!" Qian Ning erupted. "The Saintess is no ordinary person. You lowborn folk managed to come back alive—how could she possibly have met with disaster? I don't care what methods you use or how many people you send; if I don't see the Saintess within three days, you know the consequences. Get out!"

The seven family leaders seethed inwardly but dared not show it; their small powers were no match for the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and they had no stomach to cross Qian Ning.

Before they dispersed, a maid rushed in, her face alight with joy, calling out, "Protector Qian! Protector Qian! The Saintess—she's back!"

Qian Ning's brow rose; he dashed out and hurried toward the maid, asking urgently, "Where?"

The maid pointed, and following her direction Qian Ning saw An Ling'er emerge with a light step.

Tears streamed down Qian Ning's face; he was too overwhelmed to speak, the weight that had pressed on his heart finally lifted.

When An Ling'er came forward, everyone bowed and greeted, "We pay respect to the Saintess!"

An Ling'er nodded slightly and, a little ashamed, said, "Uncle Qian, sorry to have troubled you all."

"You're safe, and that's what matters," Qian Ning beamed, visibly relieved. "Were you hurt?"

An Ling'er slowly shook her head.

"Then where have you been these past days?"

"When I went out before I had a sudden insight and found a hidden place to seclude myself. I didn't expect a month to pass so quickly," An Ling'er said softly, appearing a little uneasy.

Qian Ning looked at her with suspicion, sensing she might be lying though he couldn't fathom why; but since she was safe he felt grateful and did not press further, nodding repeatedly, "That's good, that's good."

He turned to the maid. "Bei'er, take the Saintess to rest."

"Yes," Bei'er replied promptly.

The Seven Families Alliance leaders exhaled collectively.

……

On one of the isles Yang Kai found a private chamber and, after paying a few crystal stones, stepped inside.

The chamber was run by the Seven Families Alliance for martial artists needing seclusion; its fees differed greatly from those of an ordinary inn.

Within the chamber many formations and barriers were set up to prevent outside disturbance, and the Alliance provided security—worth the price.

Hence it was popular with visiting martial artists.

Rooms like this existed in most cities; when a cultivator felt a sudden inspiration and needed to seclude, having such a chamber while away from home was convenient.

Inside the chamber Yang Kai inspected everything carefully and confirmed the seals and barriers set up within were sound—able to withstand a certain degree of impact and to give early warning. Only then did he sit cross‑legged, take out the Pill wrapped in a Pill Cloud, place it in his palm, and study it closely.

He did not hurry to leave; part of the reason was that he was eager to see exactly how this Pill had been refined, and part was that he wanted to remain and keep an eye on An Ling'er's movements.

It wasn't that he mistrusted her as a petty man, but the matter was weighty and he could not be careless.

If An Ling'er sold him out, he might be forced into conflict with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—a colossus whose enmity would bring endless trouble.

Yang Kai had learned the three moves of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique under strange circumstances; the Sacred Land would not want such secrets to leak. If they learned the truth they faced two choices: kill Yang Kai to silence him or coerce him to become the Saint Lord.

Taking An Ling'er's soul imprint had been a helpless choice.

Through that soul imprint Yang Kai could not know every detail of her actions, but he could subtly sense the tremors of her mood, making it ideal for monitoring her.

Without further thought, Yang Kai immersed his mind in the Pill in his hand.

It was a Saint Pill—of middle‑level Saint‑Grade quality.

Pillmasters capable of refining Saint Pills were rare in any age.

Even someone as renowned as Du Wan was only a lower‑level Saint‑Grade pillmaster; by his methods he could hardly produce a middle‑level Saint Pill without colossal luck.

Among those Yang Kai had met, only Elder Tianzang Li Rui could easily refine Saint‑Grade pills.

Excellent pillmasters, when observing a pill, could deduce the refiner's skill from marks and the blending of its effects.

Holding such a Saint Pill, Yang Kai felt astonished.

Though his experience was limited, he could still see how the maker had effortlessly refined this pill; its body bore no unnatural marks, smooth and complete—the refiner's skill had reached a peerless level, perhaps rivaling Elder Li.

But the era was ancient; the ruins might have been left by any long‑dead power, so uncovering the refiner's identity was unrealistic.

Most extraordinary was the Pill Cloud the Saint Pill produced: the rich Spiritual Qi wrapped the pill like drifting clouds, preserving its efficacy while continuously gathering ambient Spiritual Qi through the ages to nourish the pill.

The energy contained within this Saint Pill was nearly incalculable.

Yang Kai estimated that even a Saint‑Realm expert might not withstand its released power.

A pill reaching such a state was a legend for the ages.

Yang Kai's consciousness sank into the Pill; he studied it closely, methodically deducing the techniques the pillmaster had used and the process by which the Pill had been formed.

In a trance he seemed to glimpse a scene from countless years ago, though it remained shrouded and unclear—everything wrapped in mist.
