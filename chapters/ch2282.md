## Chapter 2282 — The Insects Emerge

Before long, Yang Kai had already put on his clothes.

“How long do you plan to occupy my bed?” Gao Xueting asked coldly, eyeing him.

Only then did Yang Kai hang his head in dejection, helplessly climbing off the bed and standing properly before Gao Xueting.

“Let me ask you, that demonic Artifact Spirit, where did it go?” Gao Xueting suddenly spoke. “Everyone says that Artifact Spirit chased after you, but today, when Lord Xiao and I tracked it all the way to Yuqing Mountain, we lost its trail. It seemed to vanish without a trace, and even Lord Xiao couldn’t see any clues. Do you know where it went?”

Yang Kai quickly shook his head, indicating he did not know.

“Then how did you escape unscathed?” Gao Xueting frowned deeply.

Yang Kai chuckled and said, “Elder Gao, you know I cultivate Space Force. Escaping is what I do best. At the time, I ran to Yuqing Mountain, used a breath-concealing secret art, and quietly hid in the void. That Artifact Spirit chased after me, searched for a while, but found nothing and left on its own. As for where it went, I really don’t know.”

Gao Xueting stared at him deeply, her beautiful eyes shining brightly, as if she wanted to see into Yang Kai’s very soul. Yang Kai felt a pang of guilt, afraid she might see through him.

After a long while, Gao Xueting finally nodded and said, “If I find out you’re hiding anything, you won’t get off lightly.”

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and cried out, “How would I dare?”

“I doubt you’d have the guts.” Gao Xueting sat on the edge of the bed, sighed softly, and said, “But honestly, it was our own carelessness. If we’d investigated more thoroughly after the battle with that demon, maybe this trouble wouldn’t have happened.”

She let out a sigh, her face full of self-reproach.

Yang Kai felt even more guilty. If Gao Xueting knew that the demon she fought that day was standing right in front of her now, who knows what would happen.

Yang Kai quickly changed the subject, saying, “Everything is destined. Elder Gao, there’s no need to dwell on it.”

Gao Xueting glanced at him, snorted coldly, then flicked her hand. A beam of light shot toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was startled, but didn’t dodge, because he sensed Gao Xueting had no intention of attacking. He reached out and caught it.

Opening his palm, he saw it was something shaped like a token.

It was about the size of a palm, forged from unknown materials. On its back was engraved the image of a tall, imposing martial artist, as if standing in midair and looking down on the world. Though just a pattern, it exuded a grand and commanding aura.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched—he realized the figure resembled Wen Zishan.

On the front, two large characters were inscribed.

Qingyang!

The whole token was a bright red-gold, dazzling and radiant.

“This is…” Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly as he looked suspiciously at Gao Xueting.

“A disciple identity token of the Shrine,” Gao Xueting replied blandly.

“Uh…” Yang Kai was surprised, then forced a smile. “But Elder Gao, I’m not a disciple of the Shrine. Isn’t it inappropriate for me to have this token?”

“From now on, you are!” Gao Xueting replied.

Yang Kai froze for a moment, then nodded repeatedly and said, “Elder Gao, this is outright strong-arming… shouldn’t you at least ask for my opinion?”

Gao Xueting shot him a sidelong glance. “Didn’t I ask you last time? After all this time, you still haven’t decided?”

Yang Kai hurriedly said, “I still need more time to consider. This matter is too complicated, and I can’t figure it out all at once. Elder Gao, please allow me a few more days to think it over.”

“How long?”

“Thirty or fifty years would be best…” Yang Kai said, but seeing Gao Xueting’s face turn frosty, he quickly added, “Of course, eight or ten years would do too…”

“Heh…” Gao Xueting suddenly let out a cold laugh.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but shiver. He felt a chill all over, even his soles cramped up.

Gao Xueting said slowly, “It seems my good temper has given you the wrong impression. Do you think I’m easy to talk to? Do you think I have no authority?”

“Absolutely not.”

“Then you look down on me, and on the Shrine?”

“Not at all!”

Gao Xueting snorted coldly. “Today, in front of Lord Xiao and the others, I already said you are a disciple of my Shrine, cutting off Lou Chi’s attempt to win you over. If you dare refuse me again, tomorrow I’ll tell them you’ve been expelled from the Shrine. Do you know what will happen then?”

Cold sweat broke out all over Yang Kai.

He really didn’t know Lou Chi wanted to recruit him. Thinking about it, he realized he’d been too conspicuous lately, probably attracting a lot of attention. Without the protection of the Qingyang Shrine disciple status, he’d surely be fought over by other experts.

Yang Kai suddenly understood that Gao Xueting giving him this identity token wasn’t to force him to choose, but to protect him.

She had carefully checked his condition earlier, clearly out of concern that something had gone wrong with his cultivation.

Realizing this, a warm feeling rose in his heart.

Yang Kai suddenly felt that with such care from a senior, joining Qingyang Shrine might not be a bad choice.

He let out a soft breath, his face relaxed, cupped his fists and smiled. “Then this disciple will respectfully accept. Many thanks for Elder’s kindness.”

Gao Xueting looked him up and down, nodded, and said, “A teachable child.” After a pause, she added, “However, because your situation is special, you don’t need to follow all the Shrine’s rules. Just live as you always have. The Shrine won’t interfere. Do you understand?”

“Understood.” Yang Kai was delighted to hear this.

“Of course, how you act in the future is your own business. You can’t represent the Shrine. If you cause trouble for the Shrine… hmph, you know what will happen!” Gao Xueting’s phoenix eyes flashed with authority as she snorted coldly.

“I understand, I understand!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly, sweating profusely.

“That’s all I have to say. Now that you have the token, you’re a disciple of the Shrine. If you have any problems or questions about cultivation, I’m free now and can answer them for you.” Gao Xueting’s expression softened as she asked kindly.

Yang Kai straightened up and quickly asked about some issues he’d encountered in his cultivation.

Gao Xueting was extremely responsible, explaining everything in detail. She even shared all her own experiences and insights into the Martial Dao without holding anything back.

Gao Xueting originally thought that guiding a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator would be easy.

But as their conversation deepened, she had to put away her casual attitude, because Yang Kai’s questions were all extremely profound and critical. Some were even things she herself hadn’t fully comprehended. Gradually, their discussion turned into a mutual exploration and validation of the Martial Dao.

It wasn’t until dawn that Yang Kai left the City Lord’s Mansion. After returning to the Qin Family, he immediately found Qin Chaoyang and secluded himself in a secret room to cultivate.

Time passed quietly, and in a flash, more than a month had gone by.

One day, Yang Kai emerged from seclusion. His newly advanced Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation had completely stabilized.

In the secret room, he checked his condition and was very satisfied with his progress. Just then, he suddenly sensed something, his expression turning odd. The next moment, he hurriedly summoned the Slave-Insect Bracelet, his Spirit Body slipping out and darting inside to investigate.

Back at Qingyang Shrine, Yang Kai had asked Gao Xueting for a lot of Formless Profound Grass to feed the Soul-Devouring Worms. During this time, the Soul-Devouring Worms had been devouring each other and evolving inside the giant urn.

Only today did they seem to have made a real breakthrough.

The Soul-Devouring Worms ranked eleventh on the Heavenly List of the Strange Insect Rankings, a very high position. They had played a huge role in the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror. After that experience, Yang Kai placed great hopes on them. So, as soon as he sensed movement, he couldn’t wait to check on them.

The inside of the urn was completely silent, as if all the Soul-Devouring Worms were asleep. But after refining the Slave-Insect Bracelet, Yang Kai was intimately aware of everything inside its space, so he knew this calm was just an illusion.

He waited solemnly for a while, then, as if making up his mind, formed a seal with his hand and opened the urn.

Peering inside, Yang Kai immediately saw the urn’s walls covered in dense, milky-white cocoons, just like silkworm chrysalises.

Many of the white cocoons had split open, and evolved Soul-Devouring Worms were crawling out, swallowing the cocoons whole as they emerged.

As time passed, more and more Soul-Devouring Worms were born from the cocoons.

For a moment, the whole urn echoed with crackling sounds, like ten thousand silkworms devouring mulberry leaves.

“So big!” Yang Kai exclaimed in shock.

The original Soul-Devouring Worms were so tiny they couldn’t be seen with the naked eye—only Divine Sense could detect them. But after this round of devouring and evolution, they were clearly much larger.

Each one was the size of a grain of rice, covered in pitch-black markings. Within those black lines was a clear aura of demonic power, obviously from having devoured pure ancient Demonic Qi before.

Not only that, these Soul-Devouring Worms seemed even more ferocious and ruthless than before, making Yang Kai’s scalp tingle just looking at them.

In less than a quarter of an hour, all the Soul-Devouring Worms had broken out of their cocoons and devoured them completely. After absorbing enough nutrients, they spread their wings and flew out of the urn.

Yang Kai retreated cautiously, watching from a distance.

He saw a cloud of insects gather above the urn. Although there were far fewer Soul-Devouring Worms than before, their momentum and scale were far beyond the previous batch.

Yang Kai was secretly startled. He thought to himself that if he’d brought such a swarm of Soul-Devouring Worms into the Divine Roaming World back then, even when facing Ban Qing, an Emperor Realm master, there would have been no need for tricks or schemes—just unleashing these Soul-Devouring Worms alone would have been enough to send Ban Qing fleeing in utter panic.

He watched for a long time, then sent a command to the cloud of Soul-Devouring Worms.
