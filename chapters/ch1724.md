## Chapter 1724 — Sea God Pearl

The six Formation Masters of the Sea Hall had not yet managed to speak when Yang Kai had already thrust the Saint Crystals used to activate the array into the surrounding slots.

The array began to operate at once; in a burst of white, blinding light the six only felt a sudden lightness throughout their bodies, and by the time they reacted the scenery before them had already changed drastically.

Looking out, the land ahead was a blackish red, and the air around them was thick with hot, fiery Spiritual Qi, giving the place an oppressive heat.

This environment was completely different from the Wuyou Sea where the Sea Hall was located.

Underfoot was a Space Array identical to the one they themselves had arranged; around them a number of martial artists were busily building, apparently erecting a palace here, and that palace was nearly finished, its aura vast and imposing.

The nearby laboring martial artists all wore the same uniform, and on their garments was embroidered a small character 'Ling'!

Lingxiao Sect disciples! The six from the Sea Hall reacted instantly—these people had arrived near the Lingxiao Sect, and this place clearly resembled the legendary Flowing Flame Sandland.

The anomaly in this Space Array had alarmed nearby Lingxiao Sect disciples, and someone came to investigate; upon discovering Yang Kai they hurriedly cupped their fists and bowed.

Yang Kai waved his hand: "I was merely testing whether the array on the other side worked. You should go about your business."

"Yes!" The disciples acknowledged the order and dispersed.

This Space Array of the Lingxiao Sect had been set up by Yang Kai outside the Flowing Flame Sandland, which avoided the drawback of others entering the main headquarters directly through the Space Array.

This Space Array carried great significance. It was the bridge connecting the Lingxiao Sect’s exterior and interior.

Yang Kai intended to lay Space Arrays across the Dark Star in major, well-known cities, so the Lingxiao Sect could contact any city at any time.

This would be of tremendous help to the Lingxiao Sect’s future development.

"Sect Master!" A Lingxiao Sect disciple did not leave immediately but stood respectfully with cupped fists.

"What is it?"

"The Great Elder instructed that if the Sect Master appeared here, you must be told that half a month ago Hall Master Qian of Yingyue Hall sent word asking the Sect Master to visit Yingyue Hall when you have time—there is an important matter to discuss."

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded.

The disciple then withdrew.

Qian Tong wanted to see him—what that was about he hadn’t said, but it probably wasn't urgent; otherwise he would likely have come in person. Besides, Qian Tong was currently a Void King Realm expert, and there were few things in this world that could threaten him.

Yang Kai didn’t give the matter much thought. He planned to finish the tasks at hand before heading to Yingyue Hall to meet Qian Tong.

After testing the smooth operation of the Space Array, Yang Kai brought the six members of the Sea Hall back to Black Reef Island.

The six all felt somewhat reluctant to part.

The very old man, reverence plain on his face, said: "Sect Master Yang, I have used many Space Arrays, but every time, depending on the distance of transmission, there are varying degrees of dizziness and blurred vision as aftereffects. Yet this Space Array caused me none of those symptoms. Sect Master Yang, you are truly talented—old man is in awe!"

The other five nodded in agreement.

Space Arrays were indeed convenient to use, but spatial teleportation imposed a load on martial artists, not only on the flesh but on Divine Sense as well.

The greater the distance, the greater the load.

Therefore, cultivators with insufficient strength wouldn’t dare attempt long-distance teleportation — a single mistake could destroy their Sea of Consciousness and turn them into idiots. Even short-distance transfers couldn’t be performed too many times in quick succession.

Which of the six Formation Masters had not used Space Arrays? It was only a matter of how many times; they were well aware of these drawbacks.

Yet those two ultra-long-distance teleportations spanning tens of millions of li just now hadn’t caused them the slightest discomfort — it felt as effortless as dropping by a neighbor’s house.

In other words, the Space Array Yang Kai had overseen had, in many respects, surpassed those relics from the ancient era and reached a new height.

The old man was naturally filled with the utmost admiration.

Yang Kai smiled faintly: "A trifle of craft. Please pass the teleportation tokens you have to Elder Sha, and tell him that when the Sea Hall here is settled, please send someone to the Lingxiao Sect—Great Elder Ye of my sect will discuss material exchanges with him."

"Sect Master Yang, are you leaving now? Why not rest a few days longer and meet Uncle Sha?" the old man urged.

"No, I must go to the Sea God Palace." Yang Kai waved his hand; with a flicker he vanished from sight.

Regret showed on the faces of the six; after a brief discussion they hurried to the center of Black Reef Island. The six teleportation tokens were crucial and they could not be careless.

The Sea God Palace was a vast power rivaling the Sea Hall across the Wuyou Sea, encompassing all intelligent life in the deep sea.

To some extent, the Sea God Palace was much stronger than the Sea Hall in both the number and the cultivation stages of its high-level martial artists.

Although the two sides had occasional frictions, they would not wage all-out war, which was why they could coexist in the Wuyou Sea.

The Sea God Palace was located somewhere tens of thousands of zhang beneath the deep sea; its vast underwater palace complex was splendidly constructed and maintained by arrays, with naturally clear air inside.

For outsiders, finding the Sea God Palace’s main headquarters in the vast Wuyou Sea was like finding a needle in the ocean; even the Sea Hall had never been able to fathom the palace’s exact location.

But for Yang Kai it was simple and effortless.

After leaving Black Reef Island he spent only one day to lock onto the Sea God Palace’s location and easily arrived.

Here he met no trouble; though the Sea Race looked down on humans and considered them a different species, they respected strength.

Yang Kai undoubtedly possessed the credentials that made them treat him with courtesy.

Moreover, Little Dolphin, the Sea Race princess, was extremely affectionate toward Yang Kai.

The two Commanders Qian Mo and Shang Ao were also very grateful to Yang Kai.

Thus cooperation with the Sea Race was even easier than cooperation with the Sea Hall.

Yang Kai personally went to see the Sea Race’s ruler, Little Dolphin’s father, the leader of the Tunjiao Race, Lie Kong. After a brief test to confirm Yang Kai’s unfathomable strength, the two sides immediately agreed to cooperate.

As before with the Sea Hall, Yang Kai proposed the plan and the Sea God Palace supplied the materials. He spent several days setting up the third Space Array within the Sea God Palace and forged several teleportation tokens.

With the Sea Hall’s and the Sea God Palace’s teleportation arrays, the Lingxiao Sect would henceforth truly be able to access deep-sea resources.

By then, whether for their own use or for trade, Lingxiao Sect would never suffer a loss. On the contrary, they could leverage this advantage to greatly expand their material reserves, ensuring that the disciples’ cultivation would face no worries — never again needing to fear a shortage of resources.

This was an advantage in the entire Dark Star that no other sect possessed!

Yang Kai did not intend to stay long at the Sea God Palace; once everything was in order he took his leave from Palace Lord Lie Kong.

But before he left, something occurred that surprised everyone.

Little Dolphin wagged her tail and ran to Yang Kai, dropping a pearl she held in her mouth at his feet.

The pearl was about the size of a fist, azure in color like deep sea water. It seemed small, but when Yang Kai picked it up he found it extremely heavy, and from within issued the sound of surging waves, exuding abundant Water Spiritual Qi.

Palace Lord Lie Kong and the Commanders Qian Mo and Shang Ao, who were seeing him off, all changed expression and grew solemn upon seeing the pearl.

Many even showed signs of nervousness.

"I cannot accept this." Yang Kai smiled faintly and patted Little Dolphin’s head.

Although he did not know exactly what the pearl was, judging by their expressions its value was undoubtedly extraordinary. He had only just established cooperation with the Sea God Palace; rashly accepting such a lavish gift might offend the Sea Race.

The main reason was that it was Little Dolphin who had given it—she was only a child; she acted on whim and could not represent the Sea Race’s will.

If Lie Kong had personally given it, Yang Kai would not have hesitated so much.

Seeing Yang Kai refuse, the Commanders of the Sea Race visibly relaxed.

Little Dolphin however persisted, making urgent, plaintive sounds, as if pledging she would not relent until Yang Kai accepted.

Yang Kai tried to reason with her, but she refused to take it back, her eyes welling with tears. He had no choice but to look to Lie Kong.

Lie Kong betrayed no hint of anger or joy; his soft gaze fixed on Little Dolphin, and after a moment he smiled slightly: "Since the Sect Master has such a bond with my little one, accept it. Judging by her demeanor, if you do not accept it she will be saddened. After all, Sect Master Yang saved her life; this is her gift of thanks. You need not refuse."

Yang Kai frowned and asked: "May I ask what this thing actually is? What is its function?"

“This is one of my Sea God Palace’s treasured artifacts — the Sea God Pearl. It may be of little use to Sect Master Yang personally, but for a cultivator who practices Water-attribute arts or secret techniques, its value is immeasurable. Within it is sealed the source of an ocean — rich, pure, and inexhaustible Water Spiritual Qi. It was a birthday gift I gave my daughter two years ago. Since it belongs to her, it is naturally her right to gift it to Sect Master Yang,” Lie Kong explained.

"The source of an ocean…" Yang Kai was slightly moved. "This could indeed be of some use to me; very well, I will accept it."

Lie Kong smiled and inclined his head.

The Commanders present, seeing matters had come this far, had nothing more to say.

"However, the Sea God Pearl is exceedingly precious. Very well— I am willing to exchange five hundred Origin-Grade Huntian Pills for it. Palace Lord Lie Kong, what say you?"

"Five hundred Origin-Grade Huntian Pills?" Lie Kong’s eyes brightened.

The expressions of the many Commanders also abruptly became elated.
