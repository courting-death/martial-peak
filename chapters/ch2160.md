## Chapter 2160 — Money Falls to the Ground

A deafening roar, a violent surge of force, and a rolling tide of blood swallowed the spot where Yang Kai stood.

“Courting death!” Kong Qi snorted coldly as he gazed ahead, his eyes searching the chaotic area, hoping to find the Spatial Ring Yang Kai would have left behind after dying.

But there was nothing at all over there.

“Could it be that even the Spatial Ring was blasted apart?” Kong Qi’s face paled slightly. It wasn’t the Blood Monster’s strength that startled him, but rather the thought of all the treasures inside Yang Kai’s Spatial Ring. Never mind what Yang Kai originally had—just those two extraordinary spirit fruits alone were of immense value.

If Yang Kai’s Spatial Ring really had been destroyed by the Blood Monster’s blow, then everything inside would be banished into the void, never to be found again.

As he was lost in thought, the Blood Monster let out another furious roar. Blood-red light suddenly burst from its body, radiating violently in all directions.

“What’s going on?” Kong Qi frowned, hurriedly leaping into the air to avoid the sweep of that red light.

At the same time, the blood light spread out, instantly filling the entire grand hall and forming a crimson barrier that sealed off every exit!

In the next instant, at the exit, the blood-red barrier caved inward and a figure strangely surfaced, as if it had been bounced out.

“There’s even a trick like this?” Yang Kai exclaimed in surprise. As he spoke, he threw a punch at the barrier.

To his surprise, the light barrier looked paper-thin yet proved extremely tough. Even a punch delivered with all his strength didn’t break it—it only left a fist mark, and that imprint smoothed away to nothing in the blink of an eye.

"You…" Floating in midair, Kong Qi’s eyes widened. He stared at Yang Kai in disbelief, as if he’d seen a ghost in broad daylight. "You’re actually not dead?"

He was a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator, completely unharmed after taking a blow from the Blood Monster, and had even managed to slip away to the exit unnoticed. If the Blood Monster hadn’t been so alert and sealed the exit with some unknown method, this guy would have already escaped…

If that happened, the furious Blood Monster would definitely vent its anger on him, and in the end, he’d get nothing but trouble…

“That brat is too devious and vicious—he’s not even human!” Once Kong Qi realized this, his anger flared, and he almost wanted to rush down and join forces with the Blood Monster to give Yang Kai a savage beating.

“Haha, Brother Kong, greetings!” Yang Kai greeted Kong Qi a bit awkwardly. He could have faked his death and slipped away, leaving Kong Qi alone to deal with the Blood Monster. Unfortunately… plans never keep up with changes, and he ended up blocked here after all.

“Greetings, my ass!” Kong Qi scowled. “If you died, I’d be just fine!”

He and Yang Kai had never met before, and after what Yang Kai just pulled, his first impression was naturally terrible—he found the man both cunning and wicked, not someone worth befriending. So he showed no friendliness at all.

Yang Kai didn’t mind, smiling as he said, “Brother Kong, there’s no need to be so distant. As the saying goes, at home one relies on parents, but away from home, one relies on friends…”

“Who’s your friend?” Kong Qi cut him off, veins bulging on his forehead.

“Alright then…” Yang Kai’s expression turned serious as he dodged another deadly strike from the Blood Monster. Ever since he’d secretly taken those two Fruits of Time, the Blood Monster seemed to treat him as a mortal enemy, attacking him relentlessly and ignoring Kong Qi.

The Blood Monster’s body was massive, but Yang Kai was skilled in Spatial Force, so dodging wasn’t difficult. The only thing that concerned him was the strange blood energy emanating from the creature’s body—it seemed to have a corrosive power, constantly eroding his Origin Qi and trying to invade his body.

While dodging the Blood Monster’s attacks, he shouted, “Brother Kong, aren’t you going to come down and help kill this Blood Monster?”

Kong Qi crossed his arms, watching the show with a mocking smile. “Why should I help? It’s after you, not me. Your life or death has nothing to do with me!”

“That’s not right, Brother Kong!” Yang Kai shook his head, his voice drifting as he moved at high speed. “You can see for yourself—the grand hall is sealed by some power it used. Unless we kill it, we can’t leave. Are you really willing to be trapped here?”

Kong Qi chuckled. “I can just wait until it kills you, then make my move!”

Yang Kai snorted. “With all due respect, Brother Kong, you may be strong, but killing this thing alone won’t be easy, will it?”

Kong Qi’s face twitched. He didn’t want to admit it, but Yang Kai was right.

Before Yang Kai arrived, Kong Qi had been confident he could easily take down the Blood Monster. But judging by its current strength, it was clear it had been holding back before.

Even if Kong Qi used his trump card, killing the Blood Monster would come at a price.

What’s more, who knew what other dangers lay ahead? Unless driven to the last resort, Kong Qi had no desire to call upon that power he least wished to use.

With that thought, Kong Qi’s expression turned sharp. He squinted at Yang Kai, saying meaningfully, “It seems you’re not an ordinary person either!”

Only now did he realize that Yang Kai was not only fending off the Blood Monster but also chatting with him at the same time! That was definitely not something a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator could do. Combined with his earlier strange behavior, Kong Qi couldn’t help but wonder which Sect this guy came from to have such strength.

"You flatter me, Brother Kong! I’m just a bit confident in my movement techniques." As Yang Kai spoke, he deliberately paused in midair, then vanished as the Blood Monster’s attack arrived, as if showing off on purpose.

“Just movement techniques, huh…” Kong Qi muttered, not bothering to press further. Instead, he called out, “I might be willing to help, but what about what you took earlier…?”

“I’ll give you one!” Yang Kai seemed to know what he was getting at and answered immediately.

As soon as he finished speaking, something flew over from Yang Kai’s side. Kong Qi frowned, caught it, and saw that it was one of the spirit fruits that had been on the long table earlier!

So straightforward?

Yang Kai’s move left Kong Qi momentarily stunned.

“Brother Kong, if we join forces, we’ll split the spoils fifty-fifty. That’s fair, right? You can’t expect to take everything for yourself…” Yang Kai’s voice rang out again.

Kong Qi carefully examined the spirit fruit in his hand, confirming it hadn’t been tampered with, then solemnly put it away in his Spatial Ring. “You’re not exactly likable, but since you’re so sincere, I’ll cooperate with you this once!”

Yang Kai grinned. “Brother Kong, you really are a reasonable man!”

“Hmph. Hold it off well—I need a moment to prepare this move.” As he spoke, Kong Qi’s Origin Qi surged, and with a flick of his wrist, a golden coin appeared in his palm. With a loud shout, he poured his Origin Qi into it.

Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately realized Kong Qi was about to unleash a powerful secret technique, and with the help of a Secret Treasure at that. Its might would surely be extraordinary, so he focused on stalling for time.

Kong Qi did this out of confidence. He might think Yang Kai was no ordinary First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but he didn’t believe Yang Kai was stronger than himself. Yang Kai could tangle with the Blood Monster for so long only because of his movement skills and speed. To truly deal a fatal blow, only he could do it.

So he naturally took on the main offensive role.

Yang Kai didn’t disappoint, luring the Blood Monster all around the grand hall, never letting it touch a hair on him. Meanwhile, as the power on Kong Qi’s side kept building, the Blood Monster seemed to sense danger and grew even more agitated.

At a certain moment, the Blood Monster finally gave up chasing Yang Kai. It suddenly turned, its crimson eyes locking onto Kong Qi, then roared and charged at him in a streak of blood-red light.

Kong Qi’s eyes narrowed, and he nearly abandoned his technique to flee.

Just then, Yang Kai flashed forward, blocking in front of him. His ten fingers danced, sending out Golden Blood Threads. In an instant, golden light filled the air as countless threads intertwined, rapidly forming a dazzling golden shield.

Boom…

The Blood Monster’s body slammed into the golden blood shield, its massive form forced back several steps. The shield, formed from Golden Blood Threads, instantly scattered and reverted to countless threads.

Yang Kai beckoned, retrieving them all into his body, then called out, “Brother Kong, if you’re ready, do it now! I can’t block a second strike!”

“Perfect timing—I just finished!” Kong Qi grinned, then grew solemn. With a flick of his finger, he sent the golden coin flying. His hands moved like dancing butterflies, forming seals as he chanted, “Money falls to the ground, all energies unite!”

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

The single coin in midair suddenly split into two, then four, then eight…

In the blink of an eye, the sky was filled with coins.

As they spun, each coin emitted a humming sound, as if possessing immense power, constantly expanding and contracting.

Under Kong Qi’s Divine Sense, the countless coins flew toward the Blood Monster.

The Blood Monster seemed to sense something and tried to retreat, but no matter how fast it was, it couldn’t outrun these strange Secret Treasures.

In an instant, one coin caught up, suddenly enlarging and looping around the Blood Monster, binding it tightly and restricting its movements.

Then a second, a third coin followed, each one looping around the Blood Monster, making it even harder for it to move.

As more and more coins fell, the Blood Monster was completely bound in a short time. Looking over, its massive body was wrapped from head to toe in countless coins, sealed tight.
