## Chapter 1219 — Sunrise in the East

"Brother Yang, are you interested in this turtle shell?" Wei Guchang complained for a moment, then suddenly asked an odd question, "If you are, take it by all means. I think this thing, though extraordinary, has cracked in many places; I don't know if it still has any use."

He knew Yang Kai had a formidable artificer backing him; the bodily materials of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast are precisely the kind of thing those master artificers covet.

He assumed that even if he took this turtle shell back, he wouldn't find someone suitable to refine it into a Secret Treasure — Master Gelin was already decrepit with age and hadn't forged a Secret Treasure in many years. Elder Qian had been trying to extend the master's life these past years with little success; the master's condition was worsening and it was heartbreaking to watch.

Moreover, given Master Gelin's artificer rank, he might not even be able to do anything with this turtle shell; it might be better to give it to Yang Kai now. Perhaps this seemingly meager material would reach its fullest potential in Yang Kai's hands.

Yang Kai hesitated only a moment and did not refuse; after nodding he took the Tenth-Tier demonic beast's turtle shell and put it away.

While the two of them spoke, Xuan'er and Daiyuan were whispering together a short distance away.

At this moment Daiyuan held a jade vial in her hand, and in her palm was a pill — plump and rounded, faintly bluish in color, emitting a faint fragrance that soothed the body and cleared the mind when inhaled.

When Daiyuan glanced at the pill her beautiful eyes flickered with a barely perceptible excitement and expectation, which then shifted into an expression of admiration; her emotions changed repeatedly.

Xuan'er didn't interrupt her; she knew why her close companion showed such a look, and quietly waited at her side.

That pill was not some rare treasure, merely an ordinary restorative pill used to recover strength; however it was of a high grade — Saint King-Grade Upper-Level — and was one of the pills Yang Kai had just given Xuan'er.

Xuan'er hadn't finished using it and Daiyuan asked for it to examine closely.

After a long while, Daiyuan placed the restorative pill into the jade vial and handed the vial back to Xuan'er, drawing in a soft breath.

"Well?" Xuan'er asked.

"An impressive alchemical technique. I couldn't do it. The medicine's properties have been refined to the extreme; with a bit more luck it would have formed pill patterns. The pill's surface already faintly bears traces of pill patterns. It's a pity I don't know why it ultimately fell short." Daiyuan wore a look of regret and then, slightly astonished, added: "Not only this one — all the others are the same. This alchemist has pushed their alchemical skill to the utmost."

"That strong?" Xuan'er gasped, her apricot mouth parting. "To have so many Saint King-Grade pills nearly form pill patterns — does that mean the one who refined them might be an Origin-Grade alchemist?"

"Yes, it should be an Origin-Grade alchemist without doubt." Daiyuan said this while casting a casual glance toward Yang Kai; there seemed to be a hint of expectation in her beautiful eyes.

Seeing that expression, Xuan'er realized what she was thinking and hurriedly said, "Sister Daiyuan, don't rush — things will resolve in time."

Daiyuan brushed a stray lock of hair behind her ear and said lightly, "I know, I'm not impatient — it's been so many years already. By the way, Xuan'er, what is the background of that Yang Kai?"

She suddenly became interested in Yang Kai and began to inquire about him.

Xuan'er didn't hide anything and explained what she knew. When she heard Yang Kai had come to Dark Star from the outside world, Daiyuan's eyes brightened and her slender body even trembled slightly; the look of expectation in her eyes grew more obvious.

If others could come from the outside world to Dark Star, why couldn't she leave Dark Star and go to the outside world?

Like Wu Yi, she wanted to leave Dark Star, though their motives differed: Wu Yi wished to see the wonders outside, while Daiyuan had other reasons.

Although she badly wanted to ask Yang Kai which master had refined the restorative pill, Daiyuan restrained herself.

She and Yang Kai were not familiar — they were mere chance acquaintances. To rashly ask such questions now, possibly involving other people's matters, would only annoy; she wouldn't do anything so foolish.

But she was already thinking whether she should cultivate a better relationship with Yang Kai so that when the time came she could ask naturally.

Time passed slowly. Daiyuan and Xuan'er hadn't met for a long time and had an endless stream of intimate talk. Yang Kai and Wei Guchang were also talking openly, sharing various matters, and from Wei Guchang's mouth Yang Kai learned many interesting anecdotes and secrets of Dark Star.

Yang Kai had no intention of staying and moving with them. But since they had just escaped danger, it would be ungenerous to abandon them, so he waited for them all to recover.

Then he would bid them farewell and continue deeper into the Third Stage to find a suitable place to refine the Profound Yin Moon Water.

One day later the three remaining members of Yingyue Hall finally recovered and came to Yang Kai and Daiyuan to thank them sincerely.

This time the three no longer underestimated Yang Kai.

When the Flowing Flame Sandland first opened, the three had queued behind Wei Guchang. When Wei suggested Yang Kai join them, they were unwilling and secretly thought taking Yang Kai along would be a burden that would slow them and force them to share any gains.

Unexpectedly, this youth they thought a burden had saved their lives in the Heat-Flame Zone of the Third Layer.

Reflecting on their earlier thoughts they were filled with shame, wishing they could sink into a hole.

"You three should return to the Second Layer by the same route. Fortunately we didn't go far; with your strength and means you can protect yourselves, so don't risk remaining in the Third Layer — this place isn't for you." After they thanked him, Wei Guchang said directly.

The three were stunned and then immediately understood why Wei Guchang made that decision.

Their performance on that lava lake had not matched their status as Elite Disciples. Now that Wei ordered them back to the Second Layer, they dared not disobey. All bowed with shame and warned their Senior Brother and Sister to be careful.

Wei Guchang nodded slightly. Although disappointed in his three Junior Brothers and Sister for their performance, they were fellow disciples and he still felt a sense of affection. Before they left he gave them all the unused pills that he and Xuan'er hadn't taken.

The three bade tearful farewells, but before they could set off the sky above the Flowing Flame Sandland suddenly brightened noticeably.

Everyone noticed the unusual change. They looked around with suspicion but found nothing amiss. Just as they were puzzled, the tall female disciple pointed in astonishment at a spot, her eyes full of shock: "The sun!"

Following her finger, when they saw the phenomenon there everyone froze.

On the horizon a faint red sun was rising, its crimson light staining the sky in brilliant color. It was the rise of that red sun that had made their vision seem brighter earlier.

But no one believed it was truly the sun!

They had been in the Flowing Flame Sandland for months. In this strange space there were no sun, moon, or stars; one could not even see a sky — looking up revealed only a red expanse, blending with the dark red fissures of the land, giving an apocalyptic feeling.

In such a forbidden land how could a sun appear?

Yang Kai's first thought was that someone was fighting and had used some peerlessly powerful Secret Treasure!

But on further reflection he found that unlikely. That red sun was clearly very far away — at least hundreds of li — yet it was still affecting their visibility. Aside from a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure, no other grade could achieve such reach.

Which Sect would bring a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure and let disciples carry it into the Flowing Flame Sandland?

This place was fraught with danger; no one could guarantee survival — even Wei Guchang had nearly perished here. Unless the elders of that sect were completely foolish would they allow a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure into such a place.

Each of those treasures is a sect's Ancestral Treasure and cannot be used lightly.

Moreover, even if that were the case, Saint King-Grade cultivators here could not trigger a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure; forcing it would only cause the treasure's power to backfire.

What on earth was it? Yang Kai frowned, bewildered. Having seen so many incredible things in the Flowing Flame Sandland, he still could not understand the sight before him.

Yet he had a vague sense that this scene looked familiar, as if he'd seen it before; but thinking carefully he couldn't place it, which made him frown inwardly.

"How could there be a sun here? Has the Flowing Flame Sandland's sealing broken?" a male disciple of Yingyue Hall exclaimed.

He was not entirely wrong; if the seal of the Flowing Flame Sandland had been breached one might see the outside world, and if it happened to be sunrise then such a scene could indeed appear.

Wei Guchang shook his head, "It's not the sun."

His thought matched Yang Kai's.

"Then what is it? Senior Brother, have you seen such a sight?" Xuan'er leaned slightly toward Wei with a thin unease spreading through her.

"Never." Wei Guchang replied, then turned to Yang Kai for his opinion, but Yang Kai wore a pensive expression and clearly wasn't tending to them.

Reluctantly he looked to Daiyuan. Though Wei didn't think her knowledge exceeded his own, she might know something.

To Wei's surprise Daiyuan wore the same expression as Yang Kai.

What on earth were those two up to? Wei Guchang muttered to himself.
