## Chapter 1814 — Desperate

A single, all-out strike erupted, allowing Zi Long to instantly break free of the Ten Thousand Souls Banner’s shroud; purple light whirled about his body like a dazzling meteor as he hurtled toward where Yang Kai stood.

“Boy Yang, get out of here!” the Ghost Ancestor shouted in alarm, closing the Ten Thousand Souls Banner as he chased after Zi Long while yelling at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stood in place as if he had not noticed the danger, motionless, though his face had grown extremely grave.

Only when Zi Long was about to strike did he suddenly give a low shout and wildly surge his strength.

The Undying Five Elements Sword flowed through his whole body, its five-colored radiance bursting forth.

The Yao Transformation Technique and the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique wove together; dragon scales appeared in an instant upon his right arm, and his right hand had already taken on the shape of a dragon’s claw.

He sank his breath into his Dantian and swung a fierce punch forward.

Multicolored radiance clashed with the violet streak of light, and the surrounding Star Domain trembled for a thousand miles.

In the next instant, centered on their point of contact, a visible halo exploded outward in all directions.

Yang Kai gave a muffled grunt and was hurled backward; no matter what he could not stop his body, and in midair he spat out Golden Blood.

Zi Long, though steady where he stood, turned pale; shock flashed across his face and red blood soon trickled from the corner of his mouth.

From just that single exchange, he had actually suffered a slight injury!

This brat… a tumult churned in Zi Long’s mind; his expression was one of utter disbelief.

He was a veteran Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert and the master of Purple Star, who cultivated a world-shaking technique; within the entire Star Domain there were very few who could match him. First Stage Void King practitioners were simply beneath his notice.

Yet Yang Kai, who had only just advanced to the Void King Realm, had been able to oppose him directly.

Even people like Xu Wei and Kong Fa, had they taken that blow, would have had their bones shattered and their viscera pulverized.

What on earth was this brat’s background? Who had he apprenticed under? How could he possess such terrifying potential?

If he could fight at this level just after reaching the Void King Realm, what would happen if he broke through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm? Who in this Star Domain could oppose him then?

Thinking this, Zi Long broke into a cold sweat and only grew more determined to kill Yang Kai.

A chorus of ghostly wails rose from behind; Zi Long recognized the Ghost Ancestor closing in. He spun about and spat a streak of purple mystery light.

Taiyi Purple Profound Qi! One of the supernatural effects carried within the Purple Qi Long River Technique — a single strand of Taiyi Purple Profound Qi required two hundred years of cultivation to form. Zi Long had suffered greatly to form even three strands.

But to counter the Ghost Ancestor’s killing move he had to use it.

The purple light rushed out; the Ghost Ancestor’s face changed as he felt an utterly fearsome fluctuation of power and dared not be lax. He waved the Ten Thousand Souls Banner open and dove inside it himself.

Yet the Taiyi Purple Profound Qi advanced like a breaking bamboo and pierced directly into the Ten Thousand Souls Banner.

In an instant countless Yin-Souls were annihilated on the spot, causing the Ghost Ancestor’s heart to convulse with grief!

But he could not fuss over that now; he strove to deploy the Ten Thousand Souls Banner to dissipate the Taiyi Purple Profound Qi’s attack while racing toward Yang Kai, terrified that Zi Long’s strike might finish him off.

He soon reached Yang Kai’s side, the banner’s form receding as he reappeared, and asked with worry, “Are you dead?”

Yang Kai clasped his chest, coughed, glanced at him, and gave a wry laugh: “What do you think?”

“Good, you’re not dead. You really scared this old man half to death.” Ghost Ancestor finally let the boulder in his heart settle, but as he blinked and took a closer look at Yang Kai, his expression gradually turned to one of shock.

He discovered that Yang Kai’s wounds were not too severe; the fluctuations of power within his body remained steady and strong, and his complexion was fairly all right.

The Ghost Ancestor swallowed and, like Zi Long, was struck with incredulous shock.

This brat truly was a monster! How on earth had he reached this level? Moreover, the five-colored radiance about him and the dragon-arm that had formed were clearly extraordinary secret arts.

Especially that dragon-arm covered in scales — the Ghost Ancestor felt a pressure issuing from it that made even his heart quake.

Dragon might! The Ghost Ancestor was startled by the thought that rose in his mind.

He reined in his speculations and instead said, “Boy, are you going to quit while you’re ahead or what? I’ll follow your lead.”

“Of course not — root and branch!” Yang Kai wiped the blood from his lip and stared coldly ahead.

“Good!” The Ghost Ancestor narrowed his eyes and nodded heavily. “Very well, then I’ll go mad with you. Since I first left seclusion I’ve never actually fought a Void King Realm opponent; I didn’t expect the first to be someone like this, hehe…”

As he spoke, a fierce battle intent surged from Ghost Ancestor’s body.

On the other side, after driving back Yang Kai and forcing the Ghost Ancestor’s Zi Long to retreat, Zi Long did not pursue; instead he produced a secret treasure shaped like a round bowl and sent it toward the already dead Zi Donglai.

Gentle light emanated from that round bowl and drew Zi Donglai’s corpse in; beneath the glow, Zi Long’s expression grew solemn as he formed a complex hand sign and poured his power into the bowl.

Something was drawn out from Zi Donglai’s corpse and gathered into the round bowl.

Soon a faint, illusory figure manifested at the center of the bowl — it was Zi Donglai himself.

At first the figure was vague and insubstantial, as if a breeze might blow it away, but under Zi Long’s continuous effort it grew ever clearer, like a spirit body leaving the flesh.

The apparition’s eyes gradually cleared and brightened.

Finally, as Zi Long spat out a mouthful of blood, Zi Donglai’s shape shuddered and came to; he looked about in bewilderment and quickly understood what had happened.

“Father, please avenge your son — that bastard killed me!” the figure of Zi Donglai wailed from the bowl, though as a manifested spirit no tears fell.

“You fool!” Zi Long’s face darkened; after scolding him his expression softened and he nodded: “Rest assured, I will stand for you. Remain in the Soul-Fixing Bowl; when we return to Purple Star I will find a way to restore your body!”

“Yes.” Zi Donglai rejoiced, then with a shimmer the figure vanished.

Only then did Zi Long carefully pack away the Soul-Fixing Bowl and turn coldly to glare toward Yang Kai’s direction.

No matter what, this brat must die; even at the cost of grievous injury, he would cut him down here. If such a person were allowed to grow unchecked, it would be terrifying.

“Purple Radiance Star River!” Zi Long suddenly roared; the purple light about him withdrew at once, and a world-shocking great sword of condensed purple light appeared in his hand.

With the Purple Sword in hand, Zi Long’s aura soared, a presence spreading out that could make countless beings tremble. He glared coldly at Yang Kai and shouted in a low voice, “Boy, today no one will be able to save your life!”

Yang Kai replied unafraid, stepping forward: “You think bragging keeps you alive? My life is right here — come take it if you can!”

Zi Long said nothing; sword light flashed and wrapped his whole body. In an instant he crossed several li and struck directly at Yang Kai.

“Exile!” Yang Kai slapped forward and that space shattered, forming a black-hole like void.

Zi Long’s advance was so fast he nearly plunged into the hole; terrified, he twisted aside and avoided it.

“Moon Blade!” Yang Kai’s voice rang out again as crescent-shaped impacts rained toward Zi Long like they cost nothing.

Zi Long panicked, leaping about frantically; he did not dare to touch those attacks formed from pure spatial force.

Who knew what would happen if he came into contact with them?

Yang Kai laughed aloud: “Old man, you can’t even get close to me — you expect to take my life? Try again in your next life!”

The Ghost Ancestor watched sweating, thinking inwardly that times produced new talents and a new generation had replaced the old.

He fancied himself one of the stronger Void King Realm figures in this Star Domain and there were few who made him fear. Yet he had never seen such uncanny methods as Yang Kai’s. Putting himself in Zi Long’s shoes, the Ghost Ancestor felt Zi Long would be hard-pressed, unable to close to melee.

“Purple Qi From the East!” Zi Long suddenly shouted, his already terrifying aura rising another notch. In the next instant he did not dodge but instead met the countless Moon Blades and slashed through them with a single sword.

That slash was world-shaking, filled with Zi Long’s boundless fury and the intent of his Martial Dao; even the Ghost Ancestor’s eyelids twitched watching it.

Without hesitation he hurled out the Ten Thousand Souls Banner, turning it into a black curtain that stood between him and Yang Kai.

Rumble……

The Moon Blades were split apart; even the Ten Thousand Souls Banner could not withstand the sword’s light.

The attack descended above Yang Kai’s head, as if in the next moment it would tear him limb from limb.

Yang Kai seized the Ghost Ancestor, shifted his steps, and the spatial force about him flowed — in an instant he vanished, reappearing behind Zi Long.

Clang……

The Dragon-Bone Sword flashed from its sheath, infused with Saint Yuan, the jade-green blade at once transforming into a gigantic dragon that whipped its head and tail as it lunged to devour Zi Long.

The Ghost Ancestor acted smoothly as well; forming hand signs, a massive ghost head appeared in his palm — cyan-faced, fanged, full of gloom — light as a wisp yet swift, it followed the Dragon-Bone Sword and bit at Zi Long’s back.

Zi Long’s reactions were incredibly fast; the moment he saw Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor vanish he realized what was coming next.

He instantly drew back his sword light and swung a reverse cut.

That sword strike landed squarely upon the jade-green dragon and the ghost head.

A dragon’s cry rang out — that strike, carrying Zi Long’s full cultivation, sent the jade-green dragon flying far away, and the ghost head fared no better, its face contorting and being split in two.

Though he had managed to neutralize Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor's combined strike, Zi Long’s soaring momentum, which had just reached its peak, suddenly plummeted. His face turned slightly pale—clearly, dispelling such an attack had been no easy feat even for him.
