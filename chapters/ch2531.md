## Chapter 2531 — The Guide

When Yang Kai activated the Mountain and River Bell, the power of the Primordial Era swept forth, suppressing heaven and earth. It was extremely similar to the force hidden within this Barbaric Wild Wine, only the latter was countless times more diluted.

After figuring out the secret within the Barbaric Wild Wine, Yang Kai circulated his Emperor Yuan and dissolved the Primordial power in his body.

Pi San had already started gorging himself, looking like a starving ghost reincarnated. He seemed to know that Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi weren’t very interested in the food and drink, so he didn’t bother inviting them, simply stuffing the delicious dishes into his mouth, chewing noisily.

Normally, he wouldn’t have so many Source Crystals to spend on a meal in a place like this. Since Yang Kai said this meal was his reward for answering questions, he wasn’t going to hold back.

After a wild feast, Pi San finally rubbed his round belly and let out a satisfied belch.

Throughout the whole process, Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi only split half a jar of the Barbaric Wild Wine between them. Yang Kai only drank one cup; the rest was finished by Zhang Ruoxi. By now, her little face was flushed, and her eyes were a bit hazy.

She had the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, yet half a jar of the Barbaric Wild Wine was enough to make her slightly tipsy. Clearly, this wine was truly potent.

It probably also had to do with the fact that Zhang Ruoxi had never drunk alcohol before.

“We’ve eaten and drunk, so now I have something to ask you.” Yang Kai looked at Pi San, who was slouched in his chair as if he could die without regrets, and spoke blandly.

Pi San shivered, immediately sprang up from his chair, and said solemnly, “Sir, please ask whatever you wish. I will answer everything I know, and hold nothing back!”

“Mm.” Yang Kai was fairly satisfied with his attitude. After pondering for a moment, he said, “This is my first time here, and I know nothing about the Wild Ancient Land. Just tell me everything you know.”

Pi San was silent for a while, as if organizing his words. After a moment, he began, “Since Sir has come here by reputation, you must know something about the Wild Ancient Land. The Wild Ancient Land are a barbaric region, a place never conquered by humans. Countless powerful demonic beasts live within. There are endless natural dangers— even those in the Emperor Realm can’t guarantee they’ll come out unscathed. You could say, for those who enter the Wild Ancient Land, their lives are always hanging by a thread, and death could come at any time. Of course, the greater the danger, the greater the rewards. The Wild Ancient Land are filled with Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines, and heaven-and-earth treasures are too many to count. So, despite the danger, it still attracts countless experts from across the Star Realm. Many have found opportunities there and seen their strength soar. Even the famous Origin Cauldron Great Emperor of the Star Realm is said to have found the Mountain and River Bell in the Wild Ancient Land, earning his title as a Great Emperor!”

Pi San rambled on and on. Although what he said wasn’t particularly useful and Yang Kai already knew most of it, he didn’t interrupt, simply listening intently.

“Not just anyone can enter the Wild Ancient Land. To enter, the Dao Origin Realm is the minimum requirement. Anyone below the Dao Origin Realm isn’t even qualified to set foot there.”

“There’s only one road leading to the Wild Ancient Land— a massive canyon. That canyon is shrouded in strange, dense mist all year round. Once inside, you can’t see your hand in front of your face, and it even interferes with Divine Sense. If that was all, it wouldn’t be so bad. The key is, from time to time, a deadly howling wind blows through the canyon. If someone in the Dao Origin Realm encounters that wind, heh… it’s a nine-in-ten chance of death. The howling wind is extremely dangerous, but even more dangerous is the falling lightning. The power of that lightning is something even those in the Emperor Realm can’t easily withstand. A few years ago, an Emperor Realm cultivator, new to the place and confident in his strength, charged in without investigating. He never returned. Three years later, someone found his corpse fifty li from the entrance.”

“The top experts from all the major sects in the Eastern Territory have investigated the Wild Ancient Land. According to them, the entrance is a natural restriction. The strange mist, the howling wind, and the falling lightning are all powers of the restriction, erupting at random with no pattern. Entering the Wild Ancient Land is thirty percent strength, seventy percent luck. If you’re lucky, you’ll pass through safely. If not, you’re dead as soon as you go in.”

“Of course, if Sir wants to enter the Wild Ancient Land, you must beware of another danger— even more deadly than the mist, the howling wind, or the lightning. What danger? Naturally, it’s people! Some folks hide in the canyon all year, ambushing lone cultivators. Because they’re always there, they’re extremely familiar with the surroundings. If you run into them, it’s even more troublesome than the natural formation. If you go in, you must be careful.”

“Just the passage into the Wild Ancient Land is so perilous— inside, it’s even more fraught with danger. To be honest, because the Wild Ancient Land are so unique, the place is filled with Primordial power everywhere. No one can really explain what this power is, but those who’ve been inside say that if you’re shrouded by it, your strength will drop to varying degrees— some lose ten or twenty percent, some lose half. Many experts have died there because the Primordial power prevented them from using their full strength.”

“That’s why I insisted Sir and this young lady try the Barbaric Wild Wine. The Primordial power in the wine isn’t strong, but it’s very pure. Drinking it gives you some understanding of that strange power, so you won’t panic when you encounter it inside.”

“The main dangers in the Wild Ancient Land are the canyon and the Primordial aura. As for what you’ll encounter inside… I don’t need to say more, do I? Demonic beasts are everywhere, natural restrictions and formations are countless, and it’s even said that Divine Spirits exist there. In the whole Star Realm, there’s no place more dangerous than the Wild Ancient Land.”

After listening to Pi San, Yang Kai’s expression grew a bit more serious.

According to Pi San, if just the passage into the Wild Ancient Land was so dangerous, the inside must be ten times worse.

He wasn’t worried about encountering danger himself. He was just concerned about Xiaoxiao, who had only been at the Void King Realm when he entered this place. Could he really survive safely in the Wild Ancient Land?

As for the Primordial aura, he didn’t care much.

The Primordial Era power on the Mountain and River Bell was far denser than this so-called Primordial aura. He didn’t need to drink any Barbaric Wild Wine to be familiar with it. As the current master of the Mountain and River Cauldron, Yang Kai believed the Primordial aura in the Wild Ancient Land wouldn’t affect him much.

Seeing Yang Kai’s grave expression, Pi San thought he was getting cold feet.

That was normal. Many came here by reputation, but after hearing about the dangers, they left with their tails between their legs. Every year, countless cultivators passed through this desolate city. Pi San had lived here for thirty years and was used to it.

He hesitated for a moment, then said, “Sir, the Wild Ancient Land are full of opportunities, but if you’re just treasure hunting, it’s better not to go. Wouldn’t it be better to take this young lady somewhere else?”

This meal had cost Yang Kai five hundred thirty thousand Lower-Level Source Crystals, and Yang Kai hadn’t even frowned. So Pi San was quite grateful, and couldn’t help but try to persuade him.

Yang Kai said, “I must enter the Wild Ancient Land. It’s not for treasure.”

Xiaoxiao had last disappeared in the Wild Ancient Land. No matter what, he had to go look for it.

“I see…” Seeing Yang Kai’s resolve, Pi San couldn’t say more. After thinking for a moment, he gritted his teeth, took out a jade slip from his Spatial Ring, and said, “Since Sir has made up your mind, I’ll give you this.”

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked.

Pi San chuckled, “A map of the Wild Ancient Land.”

“There’s such a thing?” Yang Kai was immediately interested. He quickly took the jade slip, poured his Divine Sense into it, and found that it really did contain a map. At a glance, everything was clear.

“This is only a map of the outer region. No one knows how big the Wild Ancient Land really are, but after so many years of exploration, some information about the outskirts has naturally leaked out. People have combined this information to make maps like this, marking dangerous places. If you go in, just try to avoid those spots.”

“What do the black dots on the map mean?” Yang Kai asked after looking at it for a while.

Pi San said, “They represent natural restrictions and formations. The darker the dot, the stronger the restriction or formation.”

“And the red dots? Do they mean demonic beasts?” Yang Kai asked again.

“That’s right. The red dots represent demonic beasts. Likewise, the redder the dot, the stronger the beast.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, noticing that many places on the map were covered in red dots— too many to count. Clearly, those areas were home to swarms of demonic beasts, extremely dangerous zones. Even he would have to avoid them if he entered the Wild Ancient Land.

Pi San chuckled and said, “If it were anyone else, the jade slips I sell are just simplified versions, nowhere near this detailed. But the one I’ve given you, Sir, is the latest and most comprehensive map available. You can use it with complete confidence.”

He’d eaten a whole meal from Yang Kai, so he knew how to return the favor. Yang Kai felt that the five hundred thirty thousand Source Crystals were well spent.

“Then many thanks!” Yang Kai nodded.

“You’re too kind, Sir.” Pi San was a bit flattered. No one in the Emperor Realm had ever been so polite to him. Usually, no matter how strong they were, people would show disgust at the sight of him and stay as far away as possible.

Yet Yang Kai had brought him to the best restaurant in this desolate city and treated him to a fine meal.

“Sir, there’s one more thing I need to tell you.”

“Speak.”

Pi San said seriously, “If you’re determined to enter the Wild Ancient Land, you’d best go find Old Ban!”

“Who is that?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Pi San said, “His surname is Ban, but no one knows his given name. He’s lived in this desolate city even longer than I have, and he’s extremely familiar with the passage into the Wild Ancient Land. If you can get him to guide you, you’ll definitely be able to pass safely through the canyon and enter the Wild Ancient Land.”
