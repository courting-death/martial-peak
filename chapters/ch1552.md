## Chapter 1552 — Don’t You Recognize Me?

Although relations among the three races warmed considerably after the Bone Race's resurgence and their joint resistance against the enemy, that did not mean disputes had vanished — especially when it came to vying for cultivation resources; few would hold back.

It was only that the atmosphere no longer carried the same life-or-death enmity as before.

Humans did not dare to trespass into the Demon Domain recklessly.

Yet now a human youth had suddenly appeared here, not only showing no respect toward Lord Meng Ge, but boldly and brazenly uttering the Demon Lord’s true name, which provoked great displeasure among several demons.

If Meng Ge were not present, they would likely have charged forward at once and exacted a price from that human youth.

"Silence!" Meng Ge barked in a low voice. "That man… you cannot provoke him, I cannot provoke him, and the Venerable One… likely cannot provoke him either. Do not speak against him behind his back!"

"What? Even the Venerable One can’t provoke him?" The demons were stunned, their eyes trembling. "What on earth is his background?"

"You may have heard his name before." Meng Ge frowned. "He is the master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Yang Kai!"

The demons' faces immediately shifted; without another word, they fell silent.

On Tongxuan Continent, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land stood unrivaled, towering above the three races; within the Sacred Land countless masters had entered the Saint Realm, and no force could compare.

Although the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had been ostentatious these past years, their Saint Lord had been absent without word.

None of them had expected that the youth just now was the master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

"The heavens are changing," Meng Ge murmured as he stared at the leaden sky, then turned and sped toward the Demon Capital.

He had to swiftly relay the news of Yang Kai’s return to Demon Lord Changyuan.

……

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land: nine strange peaks converging to form a natural grand array. Across Tongxuan Continent the Nine Heavens Sacred Land enjoyed the highest reputation; masters emerged there in waves. Though they had not recruited disciples in recent years, their population remained flourishing and their coffers were ample.

The reason lay not only in the Sacred Land’s formidable power and its close ties with major human forces, but also in its world-renowned pill-refining arts.

For years a few top pill-refining sages had taken up residence here.

Warriors came bearing ingredients to have pills refined; failure was rare. Pay the fee and provide the materials, wait a few days, and a satisfying Spiritual Pill would be produced.

From this single source of income, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land need never worry about where its cultivation supplies would come from.

Outside the Nine Peaks, a dragon-long queue stretched for several li, at least a thousand warriors of varying cultivation standing to wait for the Sacred Land’s pill-refiners; new arrivals joined now and then.

Though numerous, there was no disorder: everyone observed their place, and newcomers naturally queued at the back instead of cutting in because they were stronger.

Anyone who dared do so had already been taught a lesson.

The earliest in line had been waiting for a month, yet no one displayed impatience; faces were full of expectation as they waited to be summoned to hand over their materials.

Idle, these warriors exchanged whispers — trading intelligence or tales of oddities and amusements — and time flew by.

This day a youth suddenly strolled from beyond the Nine Peaks, sturdy in build with keen eyes; he looked rustic, eyes darting about as he surveyed everything, clicking his tongue in wonder, gaze wandering as if reminiscing.

Seeing the long queue, that wistfulness deepened.

"It’s still the same here." Yang Kai grinned, walking forward while taking in the applicants with obvious interest.

When he had left the Nine Heavens Sacred Land long ago, the scene outside the Sacred Land had been like this.

Decades later, surprisingly little had changed; the only difference was that more people now came seeking pills.

"Hey, kid, what do you think you’re doing?" An angry shout rose from the crowd.

Yang Kai turned to see a burly man glaring at him.

"Where did this brat come from? Planning to cut the line?"

"Young man, if you value your life, go stand at the back. Don’t think you’re so great; everyone here follows the rules."

"Hmph — if he dares cut, I’ll wring his neck!"

"Kid, go to the back and queue. If you break the rules and the Sacred Land notices, you’ll be disciplined, but if you rile these people, your end will be ugly."

Before Yang Kai could reply, a chorus of voices rose from the crowd, urging him to be reasonable; many cast looks of scorn and pity.

It seemed his fate would indeed be grim.

"I’m not here to seek pills." Yang Kai rubbed his nose.

"Everyone who tries to cut says that. Kid, looks like you’ll need a lesson to learn. Want me to teach you one?" The burly man snorted, fists clenched, chest beating as he stared threateningly at Yang Kai.

"I really am not here for pills," Yang Kai said helplessly.

"Then what are you here for?" the man pressed, eyes hostile as if he would not relent without an answer.

"I’m going home. I’m from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land." Yang Kai sniffed.

"You?" The man sized Yang Kai up with disbelief, then waved to a nearby warrior, shouting, "Brother, come over here a moment."

A warrior patrolling nearby darted over at the call, swept his gaze, and frowned. "What’s this? Someone breaking the rules again?"

"Heh heh, Brother, look at this fellow. He says he’s from your Sacred Land; I think he’s trying to cut the line. Take a look — is he one of your people?" The man pointed at Yang Kai and spoke to the Sacred Land disciple.

The disciple looked Yang Kai over, studying him before shaking his head. "I don’t recognize him. Also… our disciples’ garments bear the Sacred Land’s insignia."

Saying so, he gestured at his chest.

"See, he’s lying," the man gloated, looking at Yang Kai with schadenfreude. "Posing as a Sacred Land disciple — he’s toast."

"You don’t recognize me?" Yang Kai asked the disciple.

"Should I know you?" the other retorted.

Yang Kai inclined his head lightly. "You don’t look old; you probably joined the Sacred Land not long ago. Hmm, which elder is on duty here today?"

The question made the disciple’s expression waver; he couldn’t tell if Yang Kai was bluffing or actually connected to the Sacred Land.

Although he had grown in the Sacred Land, he was only about twenty-five or twenty-six now. When Yang Kai had been in the Sacred Land, this youth hadn’t even been born, so naturally he’d never seen Yang Kai’s face.

Surprised and suspicious, the disciple did not dare to be rude. "Elder Shi is on duty."

"Elder Shi?" Yang Kai’s brow knit; a figure surfaced in his memory. He smiled faintly. "Shi Kun, right?"

"Indeed." The disciple was startled; he couldn’t fathom Yang Kai’s identity, how he dared to speak Elder Shi’s name so familiarly — in his tone it sounded like they were acquainted.

"Take me to see him; he'll recognize me." Yang Kai said casually, then changed his mind: "Never mind, I’ll go myself."

With that, the figure vanished from where he stood.

Everyone gaped, faces filled with shock.

"Where’d he go? Where did that fellow run off to?" the burly man scanned around but could not find Yang Kai; sweat broke out on his brow.

He thought he had seen a ghost.

Others wore the same expression; chills ran from head to toe.

Not far off stood a pavilion where Shi Kun sat cross-legged as if contemplating something.

Suddenly Shi Kun seemed to sense something, opening his eyes and roaring, "How dare you!"

In that instant he felt someone had intruded into the pavilion.

As an elder of the Sacred Land, he maintained order and could not be disturbed during his deliberations; he was furious that someone would barge in at such a time.

Shi Kun’s anger flared.

Fortunately it was not a crucial moment; otherwise the interference might have caused qi deviation.

With a shout he looked toward where the disturbance had come from.

On seeing the scene, Shi Kun’s mouth gaped and he froze.

Yang Kai looked at him with a smile. "Long time no see, Elder Shi — your temper’s grown a bit sharper!"

"Saint… Saint Lord?" Shi Kun exclaimed in disbelief; he never expected the one disturbing him to be the Sacred Land’s master, Yang Kai, who had been gone for decades.

At first glance he could scarcely believe it; he rubbed his eyes hard and found the person truly was the Saint Lord.

Though decades had passed, Yang Kai seemed as young as when he left; time had left no mark on him.

Shi Kun’s body trembled with excitement.

"Not bad, not bad. You’ve reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; looks like you haven’t wasted these years," Yang Kai nodded, instantly discerning Shi Kun’s cultivation.

"Subordinate Shi Kun pays homage to the Saint Lord, welcoming the Saint Lord’s return!" Shi Kun hurriedly half-kneelted, voice deep and exhilarated.

"Rise." Yang Kai waved his hand.

Shi Kun rose, still incredulous as he eyed Yang Kai like a man in a dream, hesitating, "Saint Lord, you’ve truly returned?"

"I have. How fares the Sacred Land?"

"All is well; the Saint Lord need not worry," Shi Kun answered quickly. His excitement flushed his face.

"Good to hear."

"Saint Lord, return to the Sacred Land quickly. Since you left the Great Elders have worried day and night; if they learn you have returned safely they will be overjoyed," Shi Kun rubbed his hands together.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded. "You will come with me."

As he spoke he swept his hand and a stream of Saint Yuan enveloped Shi Kun.

A moment later both vanished from the pavilion; when Shi Kun’s sight cleared he found himself and Yang Kai already within the inner peaks, before them the nine majestic peaks of the Sacred Land.
