## Chapter 929 — Cleaning House

Lingxiao Pavilion, Blood Battle Gang, and Fengyu Tower — the invading forces within had been completely wiped out; every outsider lay dead on the ground.

With the combined methods of Li Rong and Han Fei, how could the men of the Xiaoyao Divine Cult stand a chance? They hadn’t even understood what was happening before they were sent to their graves one by one.

Under such absolute domination, their resistance was utterly futile.

As they died, they began to grasp, at least a little, what the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, Blood Battle Gang, and Fengyu Tower had endured these past months when they were bullied.

A despair with no way up and no way out settled over their hearts, making them wish they might die sooner.

At this moment Li Rong and Han Fei stood in a wide open area inside Lingxiao Pavilion, curiously surveying the surroundings and wondering silently if this was the land where their lord had grown up.

There was nothing particularly wondrous to be seen here, and yet someone so extraordinary had been nurtured in this place — it was odd.

Not all of Lingxiao Pavilion’s disciples had been taken to the Void Passage; a large portion remained within the sect. After Li Rong and Han Fei cut down the forces of the Xiaoyao Divine Cult like divine generals with thunderous blows, those disciples stared at them in astonishment, wondering why they had been rescued and why their seals had been released.

A large contingent marched in through the main gate. When the disciples stationed here recognized the faces of the leaders, they erupted in excited shouts: “It’s the Sect Leader and the elders!”

“They’ve returned.”

“Huh — that person by the Sect Leader, could it be Junior Brother Yang Kai?”

“It really is Junior Brother Yang Kai!”

“……”

The shouting carried out, and the disciples who had been hiding in the shadows came out from all directions, weeping as they surged forward to greet them.

Su Mu spoke aloud for a long while, calming the many brothers and sisters and steadying their excitement.

“This time brother-in-law… ah, Senior Brother Yang is back. From now on we won’t have to fear those beasts any longer. One day we’ll march on Zhongdu and drive them all away!”

“Drive them all away!” The cry thundered, and many disciples answered Su Mu’s call.

Amid the roused crowd, one man’s expression changed; he slipped to the rear and tried to melt into the shadows, as if preparing to sneak away.

Su Mu’s eyes suddenly turned toward him and he barked: “Senior Brother Jie, where do you think you’re going?”

The clamour of the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples stopped. Following Su Mu’s gaze, they saw Jie Hongchen standing there at a loss.

A host of contemptuous stares fell on Jie Hongchen, leaving him ashamed and embarrassed beyond measure.

The Pavilion’s elders shook their heads and sighed, faces full of extreme disappointment.

“Senior Brother Jie?” Yang Kai raised a brow and glanced at Jie Hongchen as well.

This senior brother had once been the second-strongest among the young generation within the sect; aside from Su Yan, he had been the most formidable, and he’d quarreled with Yang Kai many times.

But as Yang Kai grew stronger, Jie Hongchen ceased to be of concern.

Now, seeing the elders and fellow disciples’ scornful looks, Yang Kai vaguely understood why Jie had incurred everyone’s wrath.

It had been years, and Jie Hongchen had advanced to the Sixth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm — not low, but not extraordinary either.

“Senior Brother Jie!” Su Mu sneered coldly and strode toward him, grinding his teeth: “These past months we have you to thank for your repeated ‘care’ — our brothers and sisters in the Pavilion are deeply grateful!”

“Junior Brother Su, please speak reasonably…” Jie Hongchen retreated step by step, feeling the murderous intent and hostility pouring off Su Mu. A chill ran through him as if Death itself were beckoning.

“A person like you dares call me Junior Brother?” Su Mu shouted sternly.

“Sect Leader!” Jie Hongchen’s legs went weak and he nearly fell to his knees, pleading: “Senior Brothers did it out of necessity. I submitted to those thieves only to feign weakness and look for opportunities to save everyone — I endured humiliation and bore the weight of it.”

“Endured humiliation for the sake of the greater good?” Su Mu suddenly burst out laughing. “All I saw was Senior Brother acting like a dog, obeying the orders of those bandits and reporting every secret of our Sect. That alone would have been shameful enough—but you even went so far as to cruelly kill a Junior Brother just to prove your loyalty. Junior Brother Sun Huan died at your hands, didn’t he? Don’t bother denying it—many here witnessed it with their own eyes.”

“I—” Jie Hongchen was left speechless. Seeing Su Mu’s resolution and murderous intent, he glanced desperately at the elders, collapsed to his knees, and begged: “Elders, disciple knows his wrongs; spare my life.”

The four elders looked at him coldly. Wei Xitong barked: “Spare your life? I’d sooner see you torn limb from limb. Jie Hongchen, you’ve disappointed me greatly. I raised you as the sect’s hope, but you’ve proved yourself cruel and treacherous — I was blind to trust you.”

The other three elders likewise wore expressions of murderous resolve.

In a sense, this man before them was more hateful — and more deserving of death — than the invading enemies.

“Junior Brother Yang, Junior Brother Yang…” Seeing that none of the Elders spoke up for him, Jie Hongchen turned his gaze to Yang Kai. “I know your word carries the most weight. Save my life, and I, Jie Hongchen, will serve you like an ox or a horse from this day on, repaying this favor without fail.”

Yang Kai’s expression was indifferent; he said lightly, “Senior Brother Jie… you speak too much.”

Jie Hongchen’s face went blank.

“By order of the Grand Sect Leader, I, Su Mu, preside over Lingxiao Pavilion. In the sect’s hour of peril, disciple Jie Hongchen acted out of selfish desire, tortured and killed fellow disciples, sought to live by shameful means and bowed to thieves — his crimes demand execution. Today I clear house in the Pavilion. Let all brothers learn from this, train harder, and make Lingxiao Pavilion fearsome again!” Su Mu shouted, raising a hand to look down at Jie Hongchen, his gaze ice-cold. True Yuan surged in his palm, forming a terrifying cyclone.

The palm grew enormous in Jie Hongchen’s eyes; the violent gale swallowed him.

The gathered disciples showed no pity; instead, their faces were filled with utter satisfaction.

The whirlwind passed; Jie Hongchen slumped, his eyes clouded, his body reduced to a bloody pulp that exploded with a thunderous blast.

“This junior brother of the master has some quality of a Sect Leader,” Li Rong murmured with a faint smile, watching Su Mu with surprise.

Su Mu was not very old, slightly younger than Yang Kai, but he now carried the bearing of a leader.

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“Sect Leader Su, please make arrangements for the disciples of the other two sects,” Hu Man and Xiao Ruohan stepped forward together and addressed Su Mu.

Su Mu nodded, first arranging for several juniors to deal with Jie Hongchen’s remains, then hurriedly conferring with the elders about accommodating the disciples from the other two sects.

Everyone was busy. Yang Kai walked alone through Lingxiao Pavilion.

Lingxiao Pavilion had once been destroyed. That time Qiu Family’s eldest miss, Qiu Yimeng, had come with experts and fought against the sect elders, later setting the place ablaze.

The current Lingxiao Pavilion had been rebuilt.

Yet its layout remained exactly as before.

Yang Kai went to the small wooden house he had once lived in.

That hut carried many memories; it had sheltered him when he was weak and helpless.

He remembered being a trial disciple then, scarcely eating from one meal to the next, living a hard life.

In this small wooden hut, Yang Kai obtained the Wordless Black Book, and from that moment on, the course of his life underwent an earth-shaking change.

The hut had been renovated; the tables and stools were the same as when he left, only covered with a thick layer of dust from long disuse.

Sitting on the bed, Yang Kai recalled that night when he returned and Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang was fast asleep on the bed, moonlight slanting down — she had taken his breath away.

From that moment a radiant figure had been imprinted in his heart.

Every recollection brought a sweet, wonderful warmth — a mark that could never be erased.

After sitting in the hut a while, Yang Kai went to Su Yan’s little loft.

It was in that loft that Yang Kai had once accidentally seen Su Yan changing; the curve of her back had been unforgettable.

On that occasion Su Yan, furious, used chilling power to freeze Yang Kai completely; it took several days for him to thaw, and from that he comprehended the wondrous martial skill Unyielding Will.

Xia Ningshang and Su Yan — the two most important women in his life — had both been met, known, and loved here.

His heart beat a little faster; he was a touch flustered.

Lingxiao Pavilion held so many of Yang Kai’s memories and affections.

He walked along the old paths as if he were once again a disciple of years past, treading familiar ground and recalling everything.

The Contribution Hall was still the Contribution Hall; Yang Kai could almost see Shopkeeper Meng inside, hands clasped, eyes narrowed as he leered at passing female disciples, commenting lasciviously on their firm chests and rounded hips.

The Martial Skill Pavilion remained too, housing many of Lingxiao Pavilion’s secret techniques.

But those things no longer held any value for the present Yang Kai.

He came to the Dragon Confinement Ravine. Beside it the wind howled, the ravine bottom seemed boundless and unfathomable.

A few fruit trees stood there, swaying in the wind; Yang Kai had planted them years ago. Then they were only his height; now they had grown full and provided cool shade.

With a leap he let his body fall toward the ravine.

Midway down he deftly twisted and slipped into the cave he had painstakingly carved long ago.

The cave held some potted plants Xia Ningshang had moved in; without the evil demonic qi flowing from the ravine, green vines had crawled up everywhere.

A few delicate flowers even bloomed by the cave mouth.

The scent of Su Yan and Xia Ningshang still faintly lingered inside the cave.

This cave-dwelling was the secret place of the three of them. More than once, when Yang Kai and Su Yan were intimate, Little Senior Sister lay upon that stone bed, “slumbering without waking.”

Yang Kai sat cross-legged at the cave mouth and closed his eyes. After walking, seeing, and reminiscing, he felt his soul uplifted; an ineffable pleasure filled him.

A humming burst—Yang Kai’s flesh began to stir, and the True Yuan surging through him rushed like a breached river, roaring and torrenting forth.
