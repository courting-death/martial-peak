## Chapter 810 — Great Yao Lord

The Nine Heavens Divine Technique had already been fully comprehended by him within the Sacred Tomb; what remained now were only practice and experience, and with Kuang Shi—an expert equivalent to the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm—there to spar with him, Yang Kai could scarcely have asked for better training.

In battle the Nine Heavens Divine Technique flared with astonishing radiance, and the longer the fight went on, the more adept Yang Kai became at wielding it.

The yao experts perched on the trunk sensed something amiss—Kuang Shi was not a match for him at all!

"Sister Caidie, this human is so interesting—how can he change his moves so much when he fights?" The cat‑eared girl’s eyes shone as if she’d just seen something novel, and she kept praising him.

Caidie inclined her head and explained patiently, "Humans don’t have our yao inner cores nor our naturally robust physiques, so they develop things called Martial Skills to make full use of the True Yuan in their bodies. In fact, many human martial skills were formed by imitating our yao abilities. When you fight humans in future, don’t underestimate those techniques or you’ll pay dearly."

"Mm, I’ll remember." The cat‑eared girl nodded heavily, then, suddenly excited, asked, "Sister Caidie, can we catch this human and play with him? He can put on so many tricks—playing with him would be so much fun."

Caidie froze, rubbed her forehead, and smiled wryly, "That probably won’t work."

"Why not?"

"Because…" Before Caidie could finish, her expression sharpened. She glanced up toward Thundertree Manor as if receiving some instruction, then nodded seriously, "Yes."

With that she rose gracefully, fixed a cold gaze on the battle below, and commanded, "Enough!"

At her order, Kuang Shi immediately withdrew from Yang Kai’s side, regarding him with a strange look as he swayed his head, "You’re something else—lucky I didn’t recklessly attack you the other day, or I might have suffered a great fall!"

"Brother Kuang flatters me—you’re not bad either!" Yang Kai chuckled.

Kuang Shi swelled with pride at once, but when he felt Caidie’s icy stare upon him his face flushed with embarrassment and he bolted away, calling back from a distance, "I’m going on patrol; the forest hasn’t been very peaceful lately!"

After he left, Yang Kai looked up toward Caidie and smiled, "So I’ve passed your test?"

"Overconfident!" Disgust curled in Caidie’s eyes. She said coldly, "Come with me—Great Yao Lord wants to see you."

Saying so, her wings fluttered and she flew upward.

Yang Kai nodded and hurried after her. The yao experts on the trunk watched him disappear, their faces showing a trace of dissatisfaction as if the fight had ended too abruptly for their liking.

The cat‑eared girl puckered her lips and watched Yang Kai go with lingering reluctance.

They flew higher and higher; the ancient tree truly pierced the clouds, its branches wide and dense. As they rose, Yang Kai saw many yao carving hollows into the trunk to make homes, and some had built treetop houses.

The entire ancient tree resembled one large family, with demonic beasts moving about everywhere.

Yang Kai felt an inexplicable, exceptional cohesion in this place.

Across the world the number of demonic beasts was vast, but those yao who had gained intelligence were few, so compared with humans and the demonic races they were more united; under the Great Yao Lord, everyone treated one another like brothers and sisters.

Although Kuang Shi had appeared terrified when he met Caidie, the yao had little use for unnecessary ceremony—anything irrelevant to survival and strength was superfluous here.

Shape‑shifting yao experts were particularly rare; most retained their beast forms. Since entering the Beast Sea Great Forest, Yang Kai had seen no more than ten shape‑shifters.

Each one was a master.

The higher they flew, the denser the Spiritual Qi grew, and Yang Kai keenly sensed that the trunk of this ancient tree contained a great deal of thunder essence.

It was likely due to years of drawing upon the power of Nine Heavens’ lightning, which had imbued this millennia‑old Thunder‑Devouring Tree with the aura of thunder.

After some time Yang Kai and Caidie reached the clouds, where tufts of cotton‑like white cloud drifted within reach—exquisite and beautiful—and upon a long, slanted branch stood a finely crafted wooden house.

A long, lingering aura that Yang Kai could not help but take seriously drifted out from within that wooden house.

He felt a chill run through him.

"Go inside—Great Yao Lord is waiting for you in there!" Caidie halted before the house and indicated to Yang Kai.

"Thank you!" Yang Kai inclined his head slightly and stepped in.

Inside he immediately saw a middle‑aged man seated in the center of the room. The man was remarkably handsome and wore plain hemp garments that made him seem harmless, but two short horns less than a finger’s length protruded from either side of his forehead.

The horns shone in red and blue, containing potent flames and thunder energies that occasionally sparked with strange light.

His true form was an Eighth‑Tier peak demonic beast—the Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon—the Great Yao Lord!

Yang Kai bowed solemnly.

The Great Yao Lord opened his eyes slowly and looked at Yang Kai calmly; there was no intent to scrutinize, yet beneath that gaze Yang Kai felt an unease, as if his secrets might be laid bare.

Alarmed, he promptly sealed his Sea of Consciousness and restrained his aura.

The Great Yao Lord smiled faintly—his handsome features held an uncanny charm—and asked, "Are you that fellow’s successor?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded, knowing the man the Great Yao Lord referred to was the old Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

"Your cultivation isn’t as high as his, but your talent is decent."

"You flatter me, Great Yao Lord!"

"Then why have you come?" the Great Yao Lord continued. "The Beast Sea Great Forest generally does not allow humans to enter; those who dare enter usually become food for my people. I spared you only out of courtesy to that fellow’s successor. But if you provoke me, your end will be miserable. I have dealings with him, but that doesn’t mean I’m allied with his faction—so… you’d better think carefully before answering."

Though his tone was flat, Yang Kai perceived a concealed impatience, perhaps because the Great Yao Lord considered him too young and insufficiently cultivated to speak on equal terms.

Yang Kai chuckled calmly, unfazed, and deliberately took two Spatial Pouches from his belongings, placing them before the Great Yao Lord. "I heard the old Saint Lord and you were on good terms. As his successor, I naturally come to pay my respects. After all, we may have dealings in the future."

The Great Yao Lord snorted and didn’t even glance at the pouches, saying disdainfully, "I was on good terms with him because I recognized his strength. What do you have that would make me recognize you? Maybe in a few hundred years you’ll have that qualification, but right now… you’re not impressive."

Yang Kai frowned, "A few hundred years? It won’t take that long—twenty or thirty years at most… I’ll have that qualification."

The Great Yao Lord gave a faint, cold laugh and shook his head, "Arrogant… come back in twenty or thirty years if you can—provided you live that long!"

His expression conveyed that people like Yang Kai were bound to rush to death then be quickly reborn, which displeased Yang Kai.

Frowning, Yang Kai said, "Great Yao Lord, aren’t you interested in making an investment?"

"Investment?" The Great Yao Lord cast a sidelong glance at Yang Kai and chuckled, "Invest in you? Why would I do that? I have no interest in benefits I can’t see."

Before Yang Kai could reply, the Great Yao Lord added, "Life hasn’t been easy for you lately, has it?"

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly, puzzled, "Have you heard news of the Sacred Land’s current situation?"

The Great Yao Lord shook his head slowly, "I have no interest in prying into your affairs, but that fellow visited here before he died and predicted the present situation."

"The old Saint Lord predicted it?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

"Indeed. He knew he wouldn’t live long and told me that before he died he should have taken care of that woman beside him, but being the man he was he couldn’t do it—she had accompanied him his whole life. After his death that woman would stir up great trouble. I imagine you’ve already been besieged by many."

Yang Kai returned to seriousness and nodded, "So you know the purpose of my visit."

The Great Yao Lord sneered and rose to his feet. "I knew as soon as you came. But unfortunately I won’t help you, even if you could bring resources to the yao that we lack. Our longevity as a people isn’t due to a handful of strong experts but to our refusal to meddle in outside affairs. Once we leave the Beast Sea Great Forest and step into human territory, the situation becomes beyond my control. Don’t your people also have a saying about preserving one’s own safety? For the sake of a little gain, endangering an entire clan—that’s not how my vision as Great Yao Lord works."

His gaze grew sharp as he spoke.

Yang Kai forced a wry smile. "If you understand the situation so thoroughly, I won’t say more. Whether you help or not, the Sacred Land won’t be in danger for now, and we’ve decided to temporarily abandon the Sacred Land. When we’ve accumulated sufficient strength we’ll return. But I don’t want the resources of the Nine Peaks to fall into outsiders’ hands for nothing. Since you and the old Saint Lord were on good terms, I thought to ask you to look after them for a while—this way you could also use the opportunity to improve your own strength."

The Great Yao Lord frowned and scrutinized him as if trying to see through Yang Kai’s true intentions.

After a moment’s thought the Great Yao Lord said, "Your formations are formidable and the Spiritual Qi there is indeed rich; if my people could cultivate there their strength would grow rapidly. But that alone isn’t enough—we will not leave the Beast Sea Great Forest."

"What if I left all the Sacred Land’s alchemists to you to assist with pill refinement?" Yang Kai suddenly proposed. "As far as I know, your yao lack skilled alchemists; even artificers could be left with you. Before we return, they could provide you with many pills and secret treasures—of course you’d supply materials, which I think wouldn’t be difficult for you."
