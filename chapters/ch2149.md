## Chapter 2149 — Do You Want Your Hand or Your Life

"Young lady, do you know me?" Yang Kai swept his gaze over the four groups, taking them all in at a glance, then asked the female disciple from Star God Palace suspiciously.

One shout came from Xiao Baiyi, the other from this woman.

If she didn’t recognize him, how could she have shouted like that?

To Yang Kai’s surprise, the young woman from Star God Palace only smiled faintly, shook her head, and said, “I’ve got the wrong person.”

Lan Xun said this because, although she recognized Yang Kai, Yang Kai did not recognize her.

Back then, in the Third Stage of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, Lan Xun had used a disguise bead to change her appearance, so what Yang Kai saw then was not her current face.

"Uh..." Yang Kai was left speechless, then turned to Xiao Baiyi and said, "Xiao Bai, you’re here too? There's nowhere we don't run into each other!"

The veins on Xiao Baiyi’s forehead bulged as he shouted, "Do you have a death wish?"

Murong Xiaoxiao, standing to the side, pursed her lips in a smile and nodded slightly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai said, "Why so cold? It’s rare for us all to meet here, it must be fate!"

Xiao Baiyi snorted, "Who has fate with you? But for you to survive the pursuit of that flame beast, it’s really a bit surprising. I must look at you in a new light."

Though his words sounded like praise, his tone was full of mockery and sarcasm, for reasons unknown.

Back then, no one knew what madness had seized that flame beast of the Summer Domain. So many people scattered and fled, but it fixated on Yang Kai. Many thought Yang Kai was doomed, and Xiao Baiyi was among them.

After all, even Wuchang had to flee in panic. How could Yang Kai, with only First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, survive?

Yet the truth was shocking—Yang Kai appeared in the Two Seasons Mountain completely unscathed.

At the mention of the flame beast, the man and woman from Star God Palace both changed slightly in expression. Clearly, their Sect’s intelligence also recorded the existence of that Demonic Beast whose strength rivaled the Emperor Realm.

Wuchang raised his brows, showing a look of surprise.

He couldn’t figure out how a martial artist with such weak strength could escape the pursuit of the flame beast! If not for a group from Qingyang Shrine drawing the beast’s attention, he would have been in big trouble.

"Not at all!" Yang Kai put on a modest look. "Running away is my specialty!"

He looked completely shameless, even proud, making Xiao Baiyi glare at him for a long while.

"Enough nonsense." At that moment, a young man in green clothes, whose Sect was unknown, suddenly barked coldly and strode toward Yang Kai. "Hand over the Star Seal, and I’ll spare your life!"

He spoke as if he was doing Yang Kai a favor by letting him go if he cooperated, and his tone and demeanor were so matter-of-fact that Yang Kai couldn’t help but look at him again.

The other party just stared at him coldly, not avoiding his gaze at all.

The two from Star God Palace also said nothing. The handsome man just frowned, seeming a bit displeased, while the woman turned her beautiful eyes with interest, as if waiting for a good show.

"Although it’s a bit unnecessary, I still want to ask... how should I address you?" Yang Kai smiled at the young man in green, not angry at all.

As he spoke, he was already contacting the Small Xuan Realm in his mind, asking Hua Qingsi to help identify the man and woman from Star God Palace. After all, it was her Sect, so she should know them.

The young man in green snorted, "Eight Directions Sect, Luo Yuan!"

"So it’s Brother Luo! I’ve heard so much about you, what an honor!" Yang Kai put on a look of surprise, as if he really knew Luo Yuan’s name, but in truth, it was the first time he’d even heard of the Eight Directions Sect.

The disdain on Xiao Baiyi’s face deepened. He snorted, "Good thing you’re not a disciple of my Qingyang Shrine, or I’d have already cleaned house!"

"Heh..." Yang Kai laughed, but suddenly his expression changed slightly.

At that moment, he received Hua Qingsi’s answer from his Incarnation. What surprised him was that both the man and woman from Star God Palace were big shots.

The man was none other than Xiao Yuyang’s son, Xiao Chen!

Yang Kai knew Xiao Yuyang, a powerhouse at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, a Star Envoy of Star God Palace, famous throughout the Southern Territory. Truly, like father, like son—Xiao Yuyang was strong and respected, and his son was no slouch either, standing out among the new generation of the Southern Territory alongside Wuchang, Xia Sheng, Zhuang Bufan, and others, making a name for himself at a young age.

Xiao Chen was impressive enough, but the woman’s background was even more shocking.

She was actually the beloved daughter of the Radiant Moon Great Emperor—Princess Lan Xun!

She was the most sought-after woman among all the young unmarried men in the Southern Territory, even the entire Star Realm. If one could marry her, it would save hundreds of years of struggle!

With the Radiant Moon Great Emperor as a father-in-law, who in the Star Realm would dare provoke you?

However... though Princess Lan Xun was famous, she rarely appeared in public, so outsiders hardly ever saw her. Yang Kai hadn’t expected that someone of her status would come to the Four Seasons Land to train, and with the same cultivation as himself.

Didn’t the Radiant Moon Great Emperor worry that his precious daughter might meet with an accident in the Four Seasons Land?

Thinking along those lines, Yang Kai cast another glance at Xiao Chen. With this gallant guardian at her side, Lan Xun shouldn’t be allowed to venture rashly into danger.

These thoughts flashed through Yang Kai’s mind in an instant. Though the others saw his odd expression, they had no idea what he was thinking, only assuming he’d been frightened by Xiao Baiyi’s words, and looked down on him a bit.

Yang Kai lowered his head, looking at the diamond-shaped mark on the back of his hand, muttering, "So this really is the Star Seal..."

He’d already suspected it to be the token to enter the Shattered Star Sea. But before he could confirm, Wuchang and the others appeared, giving him no chance to verify.

Luo Yuan’s words confirmed his guess.

The Star Seal had appeared on the forehead of a demonic beast, and after Yang Kai killed it, it transferred to the back of his hand, in such a conspicuous spot... There was no way he could avoid trouble now.

His heart stirred, and he turned to Wuchang, saying, "Brother Wuchang, with a hero like you here, is it really okay to let a guy from a small Sect act so high and mighty? If word gets out, what will happen to your reputation?"

Wuchang looked at Yang Kai coldly, unmoved. Though he had a strange temper and violent nature, having cultivated to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he was no fool and wouldn’t let Yang Kai shift the trouble so easily.

He just snorted, "I don’t like that guy’s arrogance, but he’s right! Hand over the Star Seal, or... I’ll take it myself."

Hearing this, Yang Kai scratched his head in embarrassment. "So you two want to rob me by force?"

At this he looked at Lan Xun and Xiao Chen and asked, "Aren’t you from the Star God Palace going to do anything about this?"

Lan Xun smiled slightly and said, "I’m afraid I can’t help. I can only promise not to snatch it from you myself!"

Xiao Chen said nothing, just snorted coldly, his eyes full of disdain. He couldn’t understand why Princess Lan Xun seemed to care about this guy, and the words she’d blurted out earlier made him realize something.

With one sentence, Lan Xun distanced herself. Yang Kai sighed helplessly, "If I could, I’d be happy to hand over the Star Seal, but... I don’t know how to make it leave the back of my hand. Do you two have any advice?"

"Simple!" Wuchang immediately replied, his tone calm. "Just cut off that hand of yours."

"Exactly!" Luo Yuan nodded. "Hand or life, you choose!"

Yang Kai’s face turned pale with fright, and he stammered, "I... I want both! Isn’t there a safer way?"

Luo Yuan snorted, "There’s no such easy thing in this world. Looks like you want neither. In that case, I’ll help you!"

With that he gathered Origin Qi, stepped forward, and instantly closed the distance, appearing before Yang Kai. A golden light condensed in his palm as he struck fiercely at Yang Kai’s chest.

At the same time, Wuchang also moved. Now that the Star Seal was on a nobody like Yang Kai, whoever struck first would get it.

With Wuchang’s arrogant and conceited nature, how could he let Luo Yuan take all the benefit?

So he also appeared behind Yang Kai in a flash, his palm turning crystal white like carved jade, filled with extreme cold, as he struck at Yang Kai’s back.

Two Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts attacked without mercy, each intent on killing Yang Kai before the other.

After all, the Star Seal would transfer to whoever killed its bearer.

"Junior Brother Yang!" Murong Xiaoxiao’s pretty face turned pale as she cried out, "Dodge!"

Xiao Baiyi frowned. He hadn’t expected Wuchang and that Luo Yuan to attack so suddenly, without warning, so viciously.

Though he didn’t like Yang Kai and had even threatened to teach him a lesson in the Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai had entered with the Qingyang Shrine group, taking up one of their slots, and any extra Star Seals he got would have to be handed over to the Shrine.

No matter what, Xiao Baiyi couldn’t just watch Yang Kai be killed! If it came to light later, he’d be implicated. Yang Kai’s death was a small matter, but the Sect’s interests were a big deal.

Unfortunately... he was already too late to act!

On the other side, Lan Xun’s pretty face also changed, her eyes full of pity. In her view, Yang Kai was surely doomed this time, but she couldn’t save him—doing so would offend Wuchang.

"Overestimating yourself!" Xiao Chen snorted coldly, watching with indifferent eyes.

"Boom..."

A thunderous blast erupted. Wuchang and Luo Yuan, who had Yang Kai pinned front and back, both wore stunned expressions as a tremendous force surged from ahead and slammed into them. The shockwave drove them back more than ten zhang before they could barely steady themselves.
