## Chapter 1711 — Was I Bullied?

Out on the vast sea, Yang Kai listened to Pang Zhen's account and learned everything that had happened to them after they had set foot on Ghost Isle.

That day, roughly one or two hundred people from the Sea Hall and the Sea God Palace had been stranded on Ghost Isle; aside from a few who had been killed by that lanky man, the rest had been unharmed and were taken back under escort.

Ghost Isle's population had always been small, so when such a large group suddenly appeared, the island naturally tried to force Pang Zhen and the others to swear fealty.

When one was under another's roof, one had to bow; Pang Zhen and Qian Mo could do nothing but feign compliance.

However, the other leader of the Sea God Palace, Shang Ao, had a hotter temper. He had always held himself high and noble—how could he bear being ordered about and being made to obey? His proud, unruly nature stuck out on Ghost Isle; he was taken away separately and held under watch, and it seemed he had suffered some beating and torment.

In recent days Qian Mo and Pang Zhen had not seen Shang Ao again; whether he lived or died, no one knew.

Apart from Shang Ao, the rest were divided into more than a dozen teams, each led by different Ghost Isle warriors and assigned different tasks.

The tasks for Qian Mo, Pang Zhen and the others were to go out to sea in search of the Huntian Lotus; some teams were sent to mine ore inside Ghost Isle's caverns, or to do various chores.

These Origin Returning Realm experts had led unpleasant lives since being stranded on Ghost Isle; due to all manner of accidents, many had already died—especially those sent out to seek the Huntian Lotus. It was a perilous job; they often encountered sea beasts that were hard to resist, and the end result could be the annihilation of an entire team.

But no one cared for them—the rule on Ghost Isle was that any warrior who had just arrived had to endure such ordeals. Only when they truly accepted Ghost Isle in their hearts and acknowledged Ming Yue's rule would they qualify to formally join Ghost Isle and thereby be eligible to receive a Huntian Pill to temper their bodies and grow stronger.

Ming Yue’s ability to rule over Ghost Isle was not only due to his formidable strength — the most fundamental reason was that he had seized control over the Huntian Pills!

“Sect Master Yang, the people of this damned place all possess body strength that is unbelievably powerful; it seems they’ve all taken the Huntian Pill and are invincible!” Pang Zhen spoke up at the sight of Yang Kai's casual demeanor, turning his head to glance toward where the boats were and his eyes full of vigilance.

That glance stunned him.

He suddenly realized that the old man who had been walking across the sea with his hands folded behind his back had somehow come aboard and was now brazenly standing at the prow.

As for the once-arrogant, overbearing sharp-faced man and his group, all their previous swagger had vanished. Each one now stared at the old man’s back in terror, faces pale as paper. Not only did they not dare drive him off the ship — they didn’t even have the courage to breathe too loudly.

What was this old fellow's background? No one like him existed among the Sea Hall and the Sea God Palace—could he be a friend Yang Kai had made on Ghost Isle? Pang Zhen felt puzzled and uneasy.

“Elder Sha, it seems my friends were being bullied by them just now,” Yang Kai called out loudly toward Sha Hu.

He had little real connection with Pang Zhen and only a passing acquaintance with Qian Mo, but no matter what, they were from Dark Star and not the same as Ghost Isle's warriors.

Moreover, he had his own plans concerning the Sea Hall and the Sea God Palace, so naturally, he wouldn’t sit idly by and watch them die.

Sha Hu grinned upon hearing this. “Bullied? That’s easy to deal with!”

With that he suddenly turned and swept a punch toward where the sharp‑faced man and the others stood.

The fist was five zhang away from them, but a sharp surge of force erupted from the fist and swept over the bodies of the sharp‑faced man and his fellows.

Smack, smack…

A series of muffled sounds rang out; the sharp‑faced man and the others did not even have time to cry out before Sha Hu's strike blew their bodies apart midair, spraying blood and flesh across the sea. The water immediately ran crimson.

Pang Zhen, Qian Mo and the others froze on the spot.

Those Ghost Isle warriors who had seemed unbeatable to them had all been so easily dealt with by this old fellow—how strong must this old man’s body be? They could not conceive of it.

Since being stranded on Ghost Isle, Pang Zhen and Qian Mo's understanding of strength had been utterly overturned. Here there was another set of standards different from the Star Domain: the measure of a warrior's might was the power of the flesh.

The only explanation for the sight before them was that this old man's bodily strength had reached an inconceivably fearsome realm.

“Sect Master Yang… this elder… what is his background?” Pang Zhen asked weakly, and Qian Mo looked at him with concern.

“Elder Sha's true name is Sha Hu—don't you remember?” Yang Kai asked Pang Zhen with a smile.

“Sha Hu?” Pang Zhen frowned, wearing a pensive look as if he had recalled something. He stared straight at where Sha Hu stood and, after a long moment, his face brightened and he cried out, “The previous Second Hall Master of the Sea Hall?”

“You are of the Sea Hall?” Sha Hu looked toward Pang Zhen.

Pang Zhen could no longer care about anything else; he leaped from the water onto the boat, knelt to the ground and stammered with trembling voice, “Xiaguang Island's Island Lord Pang Zhen, pays respects to Senior Uncle Sha!”

“So you are the Island Lord of Xiaguang Island!” Sha Hu had heard Yang Kai mention Pang Zhen before but had not known which one he was; now that Pang Zhen had announced himself, Sha Hu smiled kindly. “Stand up, no need for formalities.”

“Thank you, Senior Uncle!” Pang Zhen was beside himself with excitement, his face flushed as he rubbed his hands. “I have long heard of Senior Uncle Sha's renown. I never had the fortune to meet you. I heard you disappeared three hundred years ago and it has always been a regret—never did I expect to see Senior Uncle's face on Ghost Isle. I am thrice fortunate!”

Sha Hu laughed heartily and said bluntly, “Nice flattering words!”

Pang Zhen's old face reddened but he was not embarrassed; instead he grinned ear to ear and pointed to some of the warriors. “Senior Uncle, these are disciples of my Sea Hall!”

Sha Hu's gaze swept over the Sea Hall disciples and he nodded slightly, “Good, good! Three hundred years—I've finally seen family again. Rest easy; with me here, no one will harm so much as a hair on your heads!”

The Sea Hall disciples were elated, as if they had found a great patron; joy broke out across their faces.

A moment before they had been uncertain if they would live or die, their prospects bleak; then the former Second Hall Master, missing for three hundred years, appeared before them and with a single mighty punch had slain several Ghost Isle warriors, rescuing them from destruction and vowing to shelter them. How could they not be happy?

Qian Mo and the other Sea Race folk felt a little forlorn.

Fortunately Pang Zhen had not forgotten them. The Sea Hall disciples had been sharing fortunes and perils with the Sea God Palace disciples and helping each other. Now that the Sea Hall had a powerful backer, they no longer needed to fear being bullied, so Pang Zhen naturally recommended Qian Mo and the others.

He immediately pointed at Qian Mo and said, “Senior Uncle Sha, this is Qian Mo, a Commander of the Sea God Palace. She was stranded on Ghost Isle along with your Junior Nephew and has helped us much over these days.”

Pang Zhen's words were no mere flattery; it was true that the Sea Race were naturally stronger in bodily constitution than humans. From Shang Ao's ability to contend with several Ghost Isle warriors at once it was clear the Sea Race did better at tempering their bodies than humans.

Sha Hu nodded noncommittally. He was willing to protect Pang Zhen and his people because they shared origins, but he held no fondness for the Sea Race. When he had been Second Hall Master he had often tangled with this proud, snobbish race and had shed the blood of many Sea Race warriors.

He had not been inclined to concern himself with the fates of Sea Race folk, but when he saw Yang Kai's little dolphin he smiled faintly and said, “Very well—then we go together. The Sea Hall and Sea God Palace's issues can be set aside for now; once we get off Ghost Isle we can discuss them.”

“Thank you, Senior Uncle!” Pang Zhen breathed a sigh of relief—he had truly feared Sha Hu might lay hands on Qian Mo and the others. If that had happened, the charge of betrayal could never be washed away and it would haunt Pang Zhen's future cultivation. Thankfully Sha Hu was understanding and spared him that worry.

Qian Mo's expression was somewhat complex as she offered her thanks.

The Sea Race and humans who had fallen into the water climbed back aboard the boat. Under Qian Mo's murderous glare, Yang Kai had no choice but to follow the crowd onto the boat and let the little dolphin swim freely in the sea behind it.

Yang Kai suspected that if he had sat on the Sea Race princess's lap any longer, Qian Mo would have tried to kill him.

He still found it hard to believe that the little dolphin—who had seemed so plain and only capable of finding Huntian Lotus—was actually a Sea Race princess. It was almost too dramatic to be real.

Perhaps seeing his disbelief, Qian Mo explained, “Her Highness the Princess is only five years old since birth. By your human reckoning she has the intelligence of a five‑year‑old child; she cannot yet take human form and is born mischievous. This time she snuck out of the Sea God Palace and unexpectedly got swept to Ghost Isle.”

Yang Kai nodded.

“In short, I must thank you for bringing the princess back to our Sea Race,” Qian Mo added.

Yang Kai stared at her in astonishment.

“But your insult to Her Highness the Princess isn’t forgiven. I, Commander Qian Mo, will remember it — one day you’ll pay the price.”

“Do as you please,” Yang Kai replied indifferently.

Meanwhile Pang Zhen also inquired after Sha Hu's next movements. Now that they had broken free of Ghost Isle's immediate control, they naturally did not wish to return to that place where they could not resist and were forced to suffer humiliation.

But when he learned from Sha Hu that their destination was, in fact, Ghost Isle's main island, Pang Zhen fell silent.

“Are you afraid?” Sha Hu turned to look at Pang Zhen, a faint smile on his lips.

Pang Zhen shook his head solemnly: “I am not afraid. It is only that our strength is too weak to provide much assistance to Senior Uncle. But since Senior Uncle has decided, we will obey—you may drag us to death, but we will bite off a piece of Ghost Isle's flesh with our teeth!”
