## Chapter 1574 — Half Moon Mountain

At the utterance of a single word, the world itself seemed to crack and the heavens were shaken.

Magna nearly goggled his eyes out; his gaze, like a leech, clung tenaciously to that single Spiritual Pill.

A veil like mist wrapped the surface of the Spiritual Pill, as if a tiny cloud hovered over it, making the Spiritual Qi within it swirl and perfume the air.

There was no doubt — it was a Pill Cloud. Although none of the yao experts present had ever seen a Spiritual Pill bearing a Pill Cloud, the moment that pill came into view they could instantly identify that the misty veil was indeed the legendary Pill Cloud!

Around them, the world’s Spiritual Qi was slowly and steadily converging toward the Spiritual Pill.

Given enough time, the medicinal efficacy contained within this Spiritual Pill would become astonishingly and terrifyingly potent — of course, that required a lengthy accumulation of time.

Even so, a single Spiritual Pill like this was already of incalculable worth.

“Lord Ba He, this should be an Origin-Grade pill, right?” Magna stepped forward and asked in a trembling voice.

“Indeed, it is an Origin-Grade pill!” Lord Ba He nodded solemnly, the shock on his face not yet faded.

The higher a pill’s grade, the harder it is to produce Pill Patterns and Pill Clouds. An excellent alchemist, with enough luck, might occasionally produce Pill Patterns or even a Pill Cloud when forging some lower-rank pills such as Earth-Grade or Heaven-Grade ones.

But Lord Ba He had never heard of any alchemist producing Pill Patterns while forging Origin-Grade pills, let alone a Pill Cloud perched above those Pill Patterns.

Even the finest human alchemist on Di Chen Star had not achieved such a feat — and that person was an Origin-Grade Upper-Level alchemist!

How profound were this human woman’s alchemical attainments? Was it mere luck, or did she truly possess the skill to make an Origin-Grade pill sprout a Pill Cloud?

Lord Ba He was struck with boundless astonishment.

Only now did he finally understand the strange phenomenon in the sky earlier — it was not merely the pill’s high rank, but the formation of a Pill Cloud, which was even rarer and more precious than a high-grade pill!

With this single pill, that human woman could confidently look down upon the entirety of Di Chen Star.

She was fully deserving of the title Grandmaster!

Lord Ba He bowed his head in reverence and glanced at Xia Ningshang. He spoke gravely to Magna, “And — this is an Origin Condensing Pill!”

Magna sucked in a cold breath.

The Origin Condensing Pill, though only an Origin-Grade Lower-Level pill, was actually more difficult to refine than some Origin-Grade Middle-Level pills. This pill was taken by cultivators when breaking through to the Origin Returning Stage; it helped overcome a bottleneck.

With such an Origin Condensing Pill in hand, any practitioner at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm could break through to the Origin Returning Stage without hindrance, with no risk of failure.

“So this master must be at least an Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemist?” Magna asked quietly.

“I think even higher…” Lord Ba He would not be too rash. Carefully, he took the pill into a jade bottle and placed it into his spatial ring. “In any case, this master must be escorted safely to the palace; you know how to handle the details!”

“I understand. Rest assured, Lord Ba He!” Magna answered solemnly.

The Lady has long favored gathering exceptional human talents; someone like this human woman was exactly the type the Lady treasured. How could Magna not do his utmost?

After confirming the pill’s grade and value, Magna’s attitude toward Xia Ningshang grew even more affable, and he urged her to rest at the city lord’s residence.

Xia Ningshang was full of grievance.

Her first Spiritual Pill to bear a Pill Cloud had been taken away silently by the yao experts.

Yang Kai comforted her with a few gentle words, which eased her mood somewhat.

Magna’s invitation was obvious in motive; Yang Kai knew what was at play and naturally would not refuse, so he accepted on Xia Ningshang’s behalf.

Only then did Magna realize that Yang Kai was the one who could truly sway Xia Ningshang. Out of respect for her, his demeanor toward Yang Kai changed as well. He said nothing more about the Huiyue City uproar and warmly escorted the senior and junior disciples into the city lord’s residence to receive proper hospitality.

Mi Tian was, of course, among those who entered the city lord’s residence.

As the young son of the Thousand-Eyed Lord, he should have been the center of attention wherever he went, yet in Huiyue City he had been completely eclipsed by Xia Ningshang.

He felt no deep jealousy; after all, she was a beauty and would eventually belong to his people, so Mi Tian did not mind much.

That was what he took for granted!

They remained within the city lord’s residence for two days.

During those two days, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang did not step outside; in the chambers arranged by Magna they discussed alchemy and jointly probed the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

After producing an Origin Condensing Pill bearing a Pill Cloud, Xia Ningshang’s insights into the Dao of Alchemy indeed leapt forward. Her comprehension broadened in many areas, to Yang Kai’s benefit as well.

Two days later, Magna personally came to invite Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang, saying everything was ready and they could set out for the Lady’s palace at once.

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang had no reason to delay and cheerfully followed Magna out of the city lord’s residence.

Outside the residence, more than thirty Origin Returning Stage experts stood arrayed in solemn formation, each bearing a grave expression as if a great battle were about to erupt at any moment.

In truth, they were merely responsible for ensuring Xia Ningshang’s safety on the road.

For a talent like Xia Ningshang, Magna dared not be careless and had pulled together most of Huiyue City’s capable fighters.

Among the entourage were experts like Lord Ba He and even Mi Tian; no thoughtless brute would dare provoke trouble.

Magna was tactful. He arranged a splendid beast carriage for Xia Ningshang. The two demonic beasts pulling the carriage were not on the level of the Thunderflame Flying Lizard Mi Tian had ridden before, but they were of Eighth-Tier caliber.

At Magna’s earnest insistence, Xia Ningshang, somewhat embarrassed, boarded the carriage. A vanguard of a dozen wolf-mounted warriors cleared the way, with a dozen more Origin Returning Stage followers behind them. Numerous experts concealed themselves at the flanks to disperse onlookers. With great pomp they left Huiyue City.

Although with their cultivation they could have flown on star shuttles and arrived much faster, Magna set up this grand display to show his esteem for Xia Ningshang.

Yang Kai rode in the carriage and shared in the honor, sitting beside Xia Ningshang.

He did not like such ostentation, but his Little Senior Sister looked helpless alone; she had never been the focus of such attention.

With no choice, Yang Kai accompanied her.

Mi Tian rode a wolf-like demonic beast behind them, his gaze almost spewing fire.

Only someone like him could befit such an outstanding woman — what was that human Yang Kai to him? Though of decent strength, he was after all a lowly human.

The intimate poses of the two in the carriage nearly blinded Mi Tian’s wicked eyes...

Just you wait — for the two demonic beasts that pulled this carriage, I will settle the score! Mi Tian vowed silently.

The journey was uneventful. This territory belonged to Lady Chi Yue; though word spread that the city lord of Huiyue City had sent a great number of Origin Returning Stage cultivators to escort a human alchemical Grandmaster to the palace, no yao in Red Moon Domain dared make trouble.

The beast carriage moved with great speed, almost comparable to aerial flight.

In no more than five days’ time, a vast cluster of towering buildings appeared in the distance.

Palaces rose in profusion — pavilions, terraces, and towers stood in neat array. Lady Chi Yue’s palace was built upon a great mountain; from its base to the summit, orderly palaces and paths of varying width could be seen everywhere.

Half Moon Mountain — this was Lady Chi Yue’s palace!

It was the Sacred Land in the hearts of all the yao in Red Moon Domain; their spiritual leader, Lady Chi Yue herself, resided here year-round.

Yang Kai stood on the beast carriage, gazing ahead with a deep look in his eyes.

“Is Sister Qingluo inside there?” Xia Ningshang asked softly.

“She should be,” Yang Kai replied with a light nod.

“I wonder how she looks now — she must be even more beautiful.” Xia Ningshang murmured.

She had met Shan Qingluo before; though only a few times back in Zhongdu, that woman’s intoxicating charm had left an indelible impression.

Xia Ningshang had never seen anyone so seductively beautiful; even she felt her heart race at Shan Qingluo’s allure.

Shan Qingluo seemed born to ensnare hearts. Xia Ningshang doubted any man could withstand her scorching charm.

“You’ll see soon enough.” Yang Kai patted Xia Ningshang’s hand, slipped an arm around her waist, and lightly alighted from the carriage.

“Lady Chi Yue’s palace is truly extraordinary; I have long admired it, and today my wish is fulfilled,” Mi Tian declared, refusing to look at Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang’s closeness — what he does not see cannot disturb him — and he extolled the palace with great feeling.

“Let us go — from here we must proceed on foot. The lord should have already been informed and someone will come to receive us.” Magna waved for the other yao to remain and led Yang Kai and the others forward.

Lady Chi Yue had indeed received notice and there were yao waiting at the mountain’s foot.

When Magna and his party arrived, a yao cultivator who had been waiting glanced lightly at Xia Ningshang and nodded, “Thank you for your efforts. The Lady has decreed that Magna will receive rewards for his escort; please go rest at the courier inn and await further notice.”

Magna beamed and thanked them profusely.

The waiting yao glanced at Lord Ba He and suddenly shouted, “Seize him!”

Several yao fighters leapt out from the crowd and rushed to bind Lord Ba He, who stood without resistance. They bound him firmly and even sealed his Saint Yuan.

“Haven’t seen you in ages; Dong Shi, you’re still as heartless as ever!” Lord Ba He chuckled.

“You still dare return? This time you won’t walk out of Half Moon Mountain alive!” the yao called Dong Shi snorted coldly.

“Whether I live or die depends entirely on the Lady’s will. Dong Shi, we’ve known each other for so many years—make sure to put in a few good words for me later.”

“Don’t be delusional!” Dong Shi glanced at him. “But rest assured, if the Lady orders your death, I will personally see you off.”

“You truly are as heartless and unfeeling as ever.”
