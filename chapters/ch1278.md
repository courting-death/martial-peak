## Chapter 1278 — The Mountain’s Change

If that were truly the case, then the gift Daiyuan gave was no light matter!

"Junior Brother Yang, rest assured, this Glazed Pearl differs from my Thousand Illusions Glaze; it carries no poison. As long as Junior Brother Yang carefully refines it, there should be no problem. Consider it the reward Daiyuan promised you earlier. I possess nothing of value—these past years’ savings were all spent to purge the toxin—so please do not refuse." She did not tell Yang Kai that this single Glazed Pearl was the fruit of more than twenty years of toil in her Thousand Illusions Glaze technique; though it had now achieved only a modest completion and could be produced again, it would be impossible without several more years of accumulation.

Yang Kai grinned and said, "I'm satisfied with this payment; Miss Daiyuan is most considerate."

Saying so, he pocketed the Glazed Pearl, glanced at the Yin Pool that had lost so much yin energy it had nearly reverted to an ordinary water pond, and said, "Since matters here are settled, let's go up."

"Good. After these few days' delay, Miss Yang Yan must be anxious too." Daiyuan smiled slightly and led Yang Kai back the way they came. Perhaps because her looks and body had returned to normal, every movement now hid countless charms—entirely different from before—which secretly amazed Yang Kai.

Before long, the two returned to the chamber above. After parting ways, Yang Kai sat down in his room.

He took out the Glazed Pearl and toyed with it for a while. A flash of sharp intent crossed his eyes as if he'd thought of something beneficial, and a faint smile crept to his lips. Just then, the door was pushed open and Yang Yan appeared, wrapped in a black robe.

"Is everything done?" Yang Yan asked.

"Mm."

"If it's finished, then we should leave." Yang Yan sounded anxious; she did not bother to ask Daiyuan why she had invited Yang Kai.

"Has something happened?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Nothing happened exactly, but I feel this place is unfit for prolonged stay. Xiaoxiao has already lingered there seven or eight days; it's time to bring it back. If one grows too greedy, problems may arise."

Yang Kai thought it over and agreed that she had a point. He nodded, "Alright, we'll leave after tonight."

Although still within Qianhuan Peak, Yang Kai could survey the outside with his Divine Sense. It was still night beyond; not convenient to leave now, so they could only wait until dawn.

With plans settled, Yang Yan returned to her chamber to rest.

The night passed without incident. The next day Yang Kai at once took his leave of Daiyuan. Though she earnestly invited him to stay longer and even wished to exchange alchemical insights, Yang Kai, feeling guilty like a thief, had no heart to linger. After some polite refusals, Daiyuan conceded and personally escorted him and Yang Yan out of the Taiqing Mountain Range.

On the way, Daiyuan told Yang Kai that after a few months' recovery she would begin to attempt the breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm. If she succeeded, she would surely visit Dragon Lair Mountain to express her thanks in person.

Yang Kai readily agreed.

While the two talked, a thunderous roar suddenly came from within the Taiqing Mountain Range. Immediately a column of light shot skyward, scattering a thousand hues, as if gouging a hole in the heavens. Even though the party was thousands of li away, they could clearly see the pillar of light.

"Glazed Mountain!" Daiyuan's delicate face tightened as she stared at the radiant column and cried out. The light issued from where Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain stood. It appeared some trigger had activated the formations arranged around Glazed Mountain, destabilizing them and causing the Glazed Light of the mountain to erupt on its own.

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly. He exchanged a glance with Yang Yan, and many thoughts flashed through his mind. He quickly recovered his composure and asked, "Has something gone wrong at your sect's Glazed Mountain?"

"Mm, I don't know what happened. It seems a restriction was triggered. Junior Brother Yang, I had intended to give you a longer escort, but I must go—my Thousand Illusions Glaze technique is involved. I have to hurry there. You and Miss Yang Yan, please take care!"

"Since such a calamity has befallen your sect, Miss Daiyuan should indeed go. We're now outside the Taiqing Mountain Range; Yang Yan and I can proceed on our own." Yang Kai inclined his head gently.

"Very well, we'll talk properly when I come to Dragon Lair Mountain later." Daiyuan offered an apologetic smile, then her figure shimmered into a streak of light and sped back along the original path with astonishing swiftness.

After her figure vanished, Yang Kai grabbed Yang Yan and barked, "Go!"

The two immediately deployed their Star Shuttles and vanished in an instant. Though unsure of the exact cause, Yang Kai suspected it had something to do with the Stone Puppet's mischief; there was no reason to linger.

After all, retrieving the Stone Puppet last night had led to an unexpected incident.

It was fortunate they were leaving today; otherwise, if anything surfaced, it would be extremely difficult for them to leave Liuli Sect. With Daiyuan vouching for them he wasn't too worried about suffering harm inside Liuli Sect, but if any trace were revealed the sect would not let the matter rest—even Daiyuan's intercession might be ineffective.

Meanwhile, beside the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain that Yang Kai had viewed earlier, dozens of Origin Returning Realm experts hovered around. Among them were over a dozen at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Each of them concealed their divine radiance, their momentum awe-inspiring.

Half of these experts darted about the mountain's perimeter, continuously projecting streams of pure Saint Yuan into an unknown restraining energy dome ahead. The dome, fed so much Saint Yuan, swelled and shrank erratically, emitting a suppressive force that sought to contain the surging Glazed Light from Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain. The rest had their Saint Yuan quietly rising within them, faces grave as they watched the mountain, ready to act at any moment.

"What has happened!" a voice suddenly cried out. At once a gaunt figure with three wisps of long beard and silver hair appeared a thousand zhang outside the Glazed Mountain.

The Origin Returning Realm experts greeted the elder in unison, cupping their fists: "Greetings, Sect Master!"

The elder was none other than Liuli Sect's Sect Master, Gong Xinghe.

Gong Xinghe waved his hand, indicating no need for ceremony, and turned his gaze to a hurriedly approaching middle-aged man and woman, both in the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

The man appeared middle-aged and imposing; though his exact years were unclear, the lines at his eyes showed he had lived long. The woman beside him was also a middle-aged beauty, slender and still alluring.

The two bowed in unison before Gong Xinghe.

"Elder Ma, Elder Du, you two have guarded this place these years—what exactly has happened?" Gong Xinghe asked sternly.

The Ma family man and the Du beauty exchanged a glance. The Ma man cupped his fists and reported, "Reporting to Sect Master: last night, for unknown reasons, Elder Du suddenly sensed that some underground restriction beneath Glazed Mountain showed signs of loosening. She immediately sent a tunneling beast to investigate. Unexpectedly, once the beast went there it disappeared—what it encountered, we do not know. It has not returned. Just now the Glazed Light erupted. We suspect some underground restriction was indeed damaged; otherwise this would not have occurred."

"A restriction damaged?" Gong Xinghe frowned and said gravely, "This hasn't happened in over a hundred years. We routinely reinforce the formations and restrictions every few years—how could they fail?"

"..." The Ma man hesitated, unsure how to answer.

Seeing his hesitation, Gong Xinghe turned to the Du beauty and asked, "Elder Du, was there only one tunneling beast?"

The middle-aged beauty gave a bitter smile. "There isn't only one tunneling beast, but only one can withstand the Glazed Light and approach the restriction around Glazed Mountain. The others are of little use. After all, we purchased these creatures from the Myriad Beasts Sect specially to guard Glazed Mountain; the Myriad Beasts Sect did not disclose the full means to cultivate and bind such demonic beasts."

"So we now have no way to inspect the subterranean restriction under Glazed Mountain?" Gong Xinghe's face darkened.

The Ma man and Du beauty bowed their heads in silence.

“We don’t know the reason behind this either?” Gong Xinghe pressed again.

The two Liuli Sect elders looked even more embarrassed.

Observing this, another nearby elder spoke up: "Whether this damage was caused by human hands or not, the immediate priority is to suppress the Glazed Light eruption. If it continues, our formations may collapse and we could lose this treasured mountain. The second priority is to thoroughly investigate Liuli Sect—to see if any outsiders have come recently. If this is deliberate, only outsiders could have tampered with it."

"Indeed!" others quickly agreed.

Gong Xinghe thought for a moment, then nodded to the elder who spoke: "Handle the search for outsiders. For now, keep the outsiders within Liuli Sect from leaving, but do not mistreat them. If they are responsible, they must have aimed at my Thousand Illusions Glaze. Hmph, I want to see who has the nerve to trespass here!"

"Yes!" The elder accepted the order and withdrew.

Nearby, Yin Sudie, who had hurried over upon hearing the commotion, giggled and chased after the elder as if to report something.

At that moment, another graceful young woman approached Gong Xinghe and said, "Sect Master, temper your anger for now. Aside from tunneling beasts, there is another way to inspect the subterranean restriction."
