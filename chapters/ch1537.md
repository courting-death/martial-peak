## Chapter 1537 — Can You See Clearly?

Yang Kai wore the look of someone who feared neither heaven nor earth, his tone arrogant and unrestrained.

The old man stared at him as if he had seen a ghost, making sure he wasn't drunk, then shook his head and said, "I truly don't know what you young people are thinking."

“Rest easy. Since I happened to run into this today, it’s about time someone cleaned up the trash in Bibo City. Just watch, sir.”

"Ah, this old one doesn't know what backing you have, but this matter started because of us; this old one will go with Young Brother then. As for the rest... let's leave it to fate."

He clearly didn't think highly of Yang Kai, feeling the youth was too hotheaded and reckless, with no regard for others.

Even so, he chose to stay, not willing to let Yang Kai fight alone.

"Thank you, sir." Yang Kai smiled silently.

"Eldest Brother Yang, we will live and die with you!" The green-clad girl blushed, her expression excited as she cried out coquettishly; several young people of her kind nodded beside her, eyes showing a resolve that could be called a readiness to die.

“Good!” Yang Kai nodded. “Mm, you just hold the line for me.”

"Nonsense!" The old man grew anxious and stamped his foot. "You... you are being ridiculous!"

He was willing to remain with Yang Kai, already resolved to die; his hope was merely to buy the younger members of his clan a chance to escape, yet he never imagined they would make such an impulsive choice.

He flew into a rage!

"Sir, rest assured, I'll keep them safe." Yang Kai said carelessly, his face full of confidence.

"Young people, ah, really do not know how high the heavens are or how deep the earth is."

"Does he not yet know how big a calamity he's brought down on himself? Does he not know whom he has slain?"

"Heh heh, this is interesting — someone actually dares to oppose the City Lord's mansion. There's a good show to watch now."

"The City Lord's mansion will never let this go. What a pity — such a fine young man is about to die in Bibo City; such a shame."

Whispered murmurs drifted from the crowd; many pointed at Yang Kai and made comments. Even more warriors, having heard the news, hurried over hoping to see the commotion.

For a time, the street swelled with people; Yang Kai and his group were surrounded three layers deep.

The previously unbearably arrogant big man now looked stunned; he watched his companion struck dead by Yang Kai's hand, dying not far off. A chill ran from head to toe and his expression turned fearful.

He had never imagined someone would dare kill in Bibo City, and kill someone from the City Lord's mansion at that.

The sunlight before him seemed to be blocked; he looked up and saw Yang Kai standing before him, arms folded, looking down from above. That gaze was like a great dragon peering at an ant, utterly disdainful.

"Young Brother, spare me!" The big man struggled to his feet, then suddenly fell to his knees, banging his head incessantly. "Young Brother, spare me! I had been blind like a dog. I meant no offense to Young Brother; please, Young Brother Lord, be magnanimous and don't hold it against me."

Compared to his life, a little shame no longer mattered.

He no longer had the courage to confront Yang Kai.

"Want to live?" Yang Kai smiled at him.

The big man nodded frantically.

Yang Kai inclined his head and his expression softened. "Mm, I could let you live."

"Thank you, Young Brother, thank you, Young Brother!" The big man wept copiously. "What is your command, Young Brother?"

He was not a fool; he knew Yang Kai would demand a price for sparing him.

"Is your City Lord still inside the mansion?" Yang Kai asked.

"Yes, yes, the City Lord is inside the mansion."

"Good. Lead the way!" Yang Kai signaled.

"Uh..." The big man froze, his expression turning extremely strange.

"Hurry up!" Yang Kai kicked out and shouted sharply.

"Yes, yes!" The big man scrambled up and no longer dared delay, hastening ahead to show the way.

"Fei'er, come with me — let's go make a scene at the City Lord's mansion!" Yang Kai beckoned to the green-clad girl and the others.

"Oh." The few young people immediately followed.

The old man was momentarily dazed, and only when Yang Kai and the others squeezed into the crowd and vanished did he snap back to his senses. He stamped his foot and hurried after them in a fuss.

The spectators erupted with commotion.

That youth must really have never feared death — to kill someone from the City Lord's mansion in Bibo City and not flee, instead heading straight for the City Lord's mansion.

There truly are people in this world with such audacity!

What on earth is his background? Does he truly have backing, or is he reckless to the point of ignorance?

Curiosity burning, everyone wanted to know what would ultimately happen to this youth, and so they all followed.

In an instant, a storm rose through Bibo City, great numbers of warriors following Yang Kai as they all marched toward the City Lord's mansion with tremendous force.

Yet most were merely here for the spectacle; would any of them truly dare stand against the City Lord's mansion? They lacked that courage!

At the center of Bibo City, before a magnificent palace, dozens of warriors stood ready in strict formations.

Word of the incident had long reached the City Lord's mansion; the City Lord of Bibo City blazed with fury and immediately ordered his forces to meet them. He wanted to see which bastard had the nerve to defy him!

As an affiliate of Battle Sky City, Bibo City's City Lord's mansion contained a considerable force — not weak by any means — with many warriors stationed throughout the city to deal with sudden events.

The City Lord himself and the members of the Elders' Council were all experts of the Origin Returning Realm, and among them were two at the Third Stage.

For the forces of a single city, such a lineup was by no means weak.

At this moment, the City Lord, Shan Ying, stood outside his mansion with a face of wrath, hands folded behind his back, staring at the bustling crowd approaching. His gaze drifted, then fixed upon one young man.

He could tell at a glance that this youth was the one leading the disturbance.

One of his subordinates, covered in blood and humbled, walked at the front as if guiding that youth.

A swallow of fear swept through; the warriors of the City Lord's mansion looked at the throng of people following the youth and felt uneasy.

"What's there to panic about!" Shan Ying shouted. "These people are just following the tide. None of them are bold enough to oppose my mansion. Kill the leader; the rest are nothing but dirt and dogs!"

"The City Lord is right, don't panic!" an Elder Council member echoed.

Hearing this, the warriors secretly relaxed.

Before long, Yang Kai and the others arrived at the City Lord's mansion, though except for him and the old man's family, the onlookers stopped a hundred zhang away.

This was also Bibo City's rule: within a hundred zhang of the City Lord's mansion no one may tread; otherwise, they would be killed! The spectators, cowed by the mansion's past might, naturally didn't dare cross that thunder line.

"Is that your City Lord?" Yang Kai's gaze fell on Shan Ying as he asked the big man in front.

The big man's eyes flickered and he gave a barely perceptible nod.

"Deacon Liu, what happened? Why did you bring so many people to make a scene before the City Lord's mansion?" Shan Ying's eyes were stern as he demanded.

The big man looked up at Shan Ying, his gaze wavering; suddenly he seemed to make up his mind. Saint Yuan circulated through his body and he raced like wind and lightning toward him.

In an instant he reached Shan Ying's side.

Yang Kai chuckled coldly; he did not stop him, as if he had expected this to occur.

"Pardon, City Lord!" the big man cried out. "I did not lead people to cause trouble — I was forced!"

"Who forced you!" Shan Ying's expression grew cold.

"It was that brat!" the big man pointed at Yang Kai, freeing himself from Yang Kai's control. Standing beside Shan Ying gave him a feeling of safety, and no longer holding back he pointed at Yang Kai and ground his teeth: "My men and I were collecting taxes with Deacon Zhou when that brat, thinking himself lofty in skill, looked down on us and attacked, killing Deacon Zhou. To save my life I had to grovel. I brought this bastard brat to the City Lord to be dealt with!"

What had been groveling to survive, in the big man's mouth became a tale of patient endurance, close to seeking revenge while baiting a tiger.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened; he couldn't help but think more highly of the big man.

"Mm, well done!" Shan Ying gave a slight nod.

"Idiot, do you think standing beside your City Lord keeps you safe? If I wanted to kill you, even your City Lord couldn't protect you!" Yang Kai sneered.

"How dare you!" Shan Ying yelled. "You are far too insolent, don't think having some ability lets you disregard everyone. This City Lord will see how you intend to kill Deacon Liu in front of me!"

"Just watch!" Yang Kai grinned, and a glint of gold flashed in his left eye. Instantly a lotus bud appeared; the lotus flickered into being and then vanished eerily.

A piercing scream rang out; the big man standing beside Shan Ying clutched his head and fell to the ground, rolling.

The cry was agonizing beyond description, as if he had suffered torments unimaginable, tearing the hearts of all who heard it and shocking their spirits.

No one knew what had befallen the big man to cause such pain.

In no more than three breaths, a muffled boom sounded.

The big man's skull burst like an overripe watermelon, blood and brains spilled everywhere, and life went out of him completely.

Gasping sounds rose from all directions.

Shan Ying and the Elders' Council warriors trembled, faces whitening, eyes filled with fear.

The green-clad girl standing behind Yang Kai froze for a moment, as if her mind couldn’t yet grasp what had just happened. But soon her delicate face turned pale—she stumbled to the side and began retching violently, heaving until it seemed even her bile would come up.

"Can you see clearly now?" Yang Kai looked at Shan Ying with contempt and gave a mocking laugh.

Shan Ying's face turned extremely ugly; he went dark and said nothing.

He had no idea what method Yang Kai had used. With his cultivation at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, he could see a bit of what had happened—Yang Kai hadn’t moved a muscle, yet had silently slain Deacon Liu. The technique he used was clearly a Divine Sense secret art.

But how powerful would that Divine Sense have to be in order to make Deacon Liu's head explode!

Shan Ying asked himself and knew that under no circumstances could he do such a thing.

A great enemy!

Shan Ying no longer dared to look down on Yang Kai in the slightest; his expression turned grave.
