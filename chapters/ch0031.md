## Chapter 31 — Tonight, a Night Raid on Yang Kai

Shopkeeper Meng was unusually kind this time, giving Yang Kai a few more herbs. Yet, he held onto Yang Kai tightly, questioning why his strength had advanced so rapidly.

It seemed that the matter of Yang Kai causing trouble for Su Mu and the others had also reached Shopkeeper Meng’s ears.

Yang Kai still harbored some fondness for Shopkeeper Meng. Though the old man was eccentric, lecherous, and thick-skinned, he was quite to Yang Kai’s liking.

This matter was difficult to explain, so Yang Kai could only say that when he entered Black Wind Mountain, he had accidentally eaten a certain fruit, which suddenly opened his mind and showed him how to cultivate.

Shopkeeper Meng pondered for a long while, considering Yang Kai’s last visit to Black Wind Mountain and his recent performance. In the end, he could only accept Yang Kai’s explanation, attributing it to a stroke of fortune.

After leaving the Contribution Hall, Yang Kai was filled with worry.

He had exchanged all his Contribution Points for herbs, which would probably only last three or four days. After that, where would he find more herbs?

Although he could earn two Contribution Points daily by challenging others, these points could only be claimed on the eighth day of each month. That meant nearly twenty days of waiting—how could he afford to wait that long?

With no better ideas, Yang Kai could only bury himself in cultivation.

Several hurried days passed, and Yang Kai’s strength at Body Tempering Realm, Sixth Stage, gradually stabilized. He was clearly trending toward the Seventh Stage. His daily diligent training was almost to the point of neglecting sleep and food, but his hard work was finally paying off.

In stark contrast to Yang Kai’s good fortune, Su Mu and the others were living in misery. Yang Kai came to trouble them every day, making their lives unbearable. They could neither defeat him in battle nor escape his harassment—truly a torment beyond words.

Su Mu himself was confident he could defeat Yang Kai, but the gap in their realms was too great to challenge him directly—Su Mu had always believed Yang Kai was only at Body Tempering Realm, Fourth or Fifth Stage.

Su Mu knew this could not continue. If things went on like this, the unity among them would dissolve.

After much thought, Su Mu hardened his heart and summoned all the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples who had been tormented by Yang Kai. His face darkened as he declared, “Tonight, we shall launch a night raid on Yang Kai and avenge our humiliation!”

Since they could not fight by the rules, then there would be no rules!

The crowd was startled. “A sneak attack?”

“Yes,” Su Mu nodded.

“This isn’t right,” Li Yuntian hesitated. “Though Yang Kai is somewhat unscrupulous, he has openly challenged us and won. If we sneak attack him at night and word gets out, we might be punished.”

Li Yuntian’s words gained the agreement of most present.

Su Mu growled in anger, “But he has gone too far! He doesn’t even respect his brothers, coming every day to harass us. If we don’t teach him a lesson, who knows how arrogant he will become. No matter what, I will confront him tonight. Anyone willing to join me, follow. Those who don’t, I won’t force you. If anything happens, I, Su Mu, will bear full responsibility and won’t drag you down.”

Su Mu’s words were sincere. Even those who felt uneasy about the plan could not bring themselves to object, for Su Mu had already taken the burden upon himself.

Li Yuntian thought for a moment and said, “Very well. If this succeeds, that bastard will know we are not to be trifled with. Brother Su, this time your junior brother will risk his life to stand with you!”

“We’re coming too!” the others said in unison.

Su Mu smiled and nodded. “That’s the spirit!”

That night, the group gathered in high spirits. By the third watch, they assembled in Su Mu’s room.

“Are you ready?” Su Mu asked in a low voice.

Everyone nodded.

“Good. Tonight, we must make that bastard remember this forever!” Su Mu pulled a black cloth over his face, leaving only his eyes visible. The others followed suit, their emotions running high.

“Move out!” Su Mu raised his arm and gave the command.

A dozen shadows darted out, swiftly melting into the night.

Lingxiao Pavilion had disciples on night patrol, but Su Mu’s group, being insiders, knew their patterns well and easily avoided them.

As the saying goes, a traitor is the hardest to guard against—Su Mu’s current actions were the perfect example.

Before long, the group gathered outside Yang Kai’s small wooden hut, some ten or so zhang away. They suppressed their breathing, all burning with righteous indignation as they stared at the dark hut.

“There’s no light inside; Yang Kai must have already gone to sleep,” Su Mu said with relief, turning to Li Yuntian beside him. “Yang Kai is strong. You and I will go in first to seize him, then the others will beat him mercilessly.”

“Understood,” Li Yuntian nodded.

“Don’t kill him. Beat him as much as you want, but no fatalities,” Su Mu reminded them, and the group responded quietly.

“Charge!” Su Mu waved his hand and dashed toward the hut. The dozen figures moved swiftly and silently through the night. All were trained cultivators, their movements soundless. Each was filled with suppressed anger, imagining the moment they would thoroughly beat Yang Kai to avenge their humiliation, their spirits soaring.

They had suffered greatly at Yang Kai’s hands these days.

Just a few steps from the hut, a cold light gleamed in Su Mu’s eyes, and a faint smile curved his lips.

Closer now, the wooden door was right before him. Su Mu reached out a hand to touch it.

Suddenly, a strange fragrance wafted into his nostrils. Su Mu sniffed lightly, finding the scent odd—not unpleasant, but unfamiliar.

Though puzzled, Su Mu paid it no mind and pressed forward.

One step further, Su Mu’s body suddenly weakened, nearly collapsing. The sudden change made cold sweat break out on him. In that instant, it felt as if half his strength had been drained. His mind buzzed dully, and fatigue overwhelmed him.

Another step, and Su Mu fell flat on his face, his nose hitting the ground first. Warm liquid flowed from his nostrils, filling his mouth with the taste of blood.

“Pat, pat, pat…” A series of sounds followed. Every Lingxiao Pavilion disciple charging toward the hut fell just like Su Mu—helpless and weak, their bodies bruised and battered. Cries of pain rang out one after another, creating a chaotic scene.

“What’s happening?” Su Mu struggled to stay conscious and turned to Li Yuntian.

Li Yuntian tried to rise but had no strength. He lay on the ground, gasping weakly, his face pale and grim. “Brother Su, I think we’ve been poisoned.”

“Poisoned?” Su Mu’s face turned pale.

“And a deadly poison…” Li Yuntian shakily stretched out a hand. “Brother Su… I’m afraid I won’t make it. You… must avenge me!”

After speaking his last words, Li Yuntian’s head lolled to the side, motionless.

Su Mu was horrified, calling Li Yuntian’s name, but no response came. Looking around, none of the disciples he had brought had escaped this fate. All were silent.

A wave of inexplicable panic and sorrow surged within Su Mu’s heart, yet his mind suddenly cleared.

This was Lingxiao Pavilion—how could they have been poisoned? Moreover, the poison’s effect was so overwhelming that in less than three breaths, so many lives were lost.
