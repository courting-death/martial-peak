## Chapter 293 — Let Us Travel Together

The group stared at each other in shock before suddenly bursting into laughter.

Su Xuanwu said, “Then let’s all stay; no one gives orders to anyone! Yang Kai, come here!”

“Disciple is here!”

“The Sect Leader says you know the way, so this time you and Su Yan will lead the others out. You must ensure that our Lingxiao Pavilion’s legacy continues! Do you understand?”

“Yes!”

“Let’s go!” Wei Xitong waved his hand, showing no hesitation as he soared back to Lingxiao Pavilion, with the others hurriedly following.

“We’ll leave too!” Yang Kai did not hesitate, as Ling Taixu had already advanced above Divine Roaming, and the Four Elders were also quite strong. Together, they were more than capable of fending off any intruders.

Moreover, whether a fight would even occur was uncertain.

But the people here had to leave! These individuals were the future hope of Lingxiao Pavilion. If they stayed, Ling Taixu and the others would have reservations even if they wanted to negotiate with the intruders.

Over a hundred people followed closely behind Yang Kai, rushing towards the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

They soon arrived at the location, where evil energy churned below, with the formation lying several hundred zhang down.

Everyone’s faces turned pale, fear gripping their hearts, especially the younger disciples, whose expressions were particularly grim.

Very few among the younger generation had reached the True Yuan Realm, and standing at the edge of the Dragon Confinement Ravine naturally filled them with dread.

“Any of the stronger Senior Aunts can come down with me; Su Yan, you come too!” Yang Kai called out, leading the way down. Immediately, seven or eight older experts followed him.

Upon reaching the formation’s location, Yang Kai began to investigate carefully.

“Junior Nephew, what are we going to do?” asked a relatively thin Senior Aunt, confused. She had the strength of the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm and was considered a steward within Lingxiao Pavilion.

“Looking for a formation…” Yang Kai replied softly, his gaze darting around. Moments later, his expression brightened: “Here!”

Everyone followed his gaze and saw a bare rock that looked no different from the surrounding area.

“Please, everyone, pour your True Yuan into it!” Yang Kai instructed, placing one hand on the rock, and his True Yuan surged violently.

With his other hand, he grasped Su Yan’s.

This was their first time fighting side by side since obtaining the inheritance of the Dual Cultivation Technique. Although the situation didn’t qualify as a battle, it was close enough.

As their hands clasped, the fluctuations of their True Yuan surged upward, noticeably speeding up. This change left the Senior Aunts watching in astonishment.

The others did not question further and followed Yang Kai’s lead, pouring their True Yuan into the rock.

With nearly ten people working together, it wasn’t long before the massive rock reacted just like last time.

This sudden development left everyone bewildered.

As Yang Kai continued to pour in True Yuan, he explained, “This is a void passage connecting the two locations, a formation left by our ancestor. This end connects to Lingxiao Pavilion. The exit is in another place.”

A Senior Aunt asked curiously, “How far is it?”

“The Sect Leader said it’s ten thousand miles away, so once we enter here, everyone will be safe.”

Everyone’s faces turned pale with shock.

The existence of the void passage had completely exceeded their understanding and knowledge.

“Our sect actually has something like this?” The Senior Aunt’s eyes nearly bulged out. “I had no idea.”

“We… all didn’t know!” The group exchanged speechless glances.

“Alright, besides me and Su Yan, the rest of you have your own tasks. Any two Senior Aunts can go in first. Check the situation over there, and the remaining people should bring down those who have not reached the True Yuan Realm!” Yang Kai commanded without hesitation.

Although he was a disciple of the younger generation, it was clear from his knowledge of secrets unknown to others that Ling Taixu valued him highly. Moreover, Yang Kai’s consideration was reasonable and well-justified, so the Senior Aunts had no objections to his orders.

Two experts from the First and Second Stages of the Divine Roaming Realm immediately dove into the void passage.

The others all flew up together.

Only Yang Kai and Su Yan remained, maintaining the operation of the formation.

Exchanging smiles, Yang Kai suddenly said, “Actually, I’m from the Yang Family in Zhongdu!”

Su Yan’s beautiful eyes brightened slightly as she asked in surprise, “The Cuckoo Bird Yang Family?”

Yang Kai smiled wryly, “Yes.”

“Why are you telling me this now?” Su Yan looked at him curiously.

Yang Kai grinned, “Because I want to steal your heart, so I must be honest with you!”

Hearing him speak so plainly, Su Yan felt a wave of sweetness in her heart, her cheeks flushing with a faint blush, and her slight shyness made her even more enchanting.

The atmosphere was peculiar; even though they had been through many moments together, the feeling now was still like that of budding romance, slowly familiarizing themselves with each other and gradually peeling away the barriers between them.

Especially with Yang Kai’s candid sincerity, Su Yan felt a sense of happiness as if she were being pursued.

What girl doesn’t wish to be pursued by the man she likes? Su Yan wished for it too.

However, due to the Dual Cultivation Technique in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, she and Yang Kai had become inseparable before they had the chance to truly understand each other. Despite the happiness and joy, they still lacked a certain process.

Now, Yang Kai undoubtedly aimed to make up for that process, filling the void in Su Yan’s heart.

In that moment, Su Yan felt that even if she couldn’t escape this calamity today, she would be content.

“Ahem…” A sudden light cough came from above. Yang Kai looked up to see a Senior Aunt bringing a younger disciple down. As they approached, without regard for the disciple’s screams, she directly tossed him into the void passage.

“You all continue…” The Senior Aunt, being someone who understood the situation, noticed the subtle atmosphere between the two and flew back up.

But how could they continue? One after another, people were sent down, and Yang Kai and Su Yan could only share a wry smile.

“I want to know about your past!” Su Yan said, her face slightly red, not caring about the others, whispering in Yang Kai’s ear.

“After we leave this time and settle down, I’ll tell you.”

“Okay!” Su Yan nodded gently, then bit her lip and said, “I also want to travel with you…”

“Then let us travel together, laughing proudly across the world!” Yang Kai chuckled.

“En!” Su Yan felt a surge of happiness, resting her head gently on Yang Kai’s shoulder.

Below the Dragon Confinement Ravine, the evil energy rolled. Before the calamity struck the sect, a man and a woman stood in midair, leaning against each other, as the wind blew, their long hair fluttering, and their clothes billowing.

In that moment, it felt like eternity.

The disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion watched the two with wide eyes, their expressions filled with disbelief.

…………

Ten miles away from Lingxiao Pavilion, a large group was rapidly approaching.

Among them were several experts at the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, and there were quite a few, totaling four. Additionally, there were over a dozen more Divine Roaming Realm experts.

Besides that, there were around forty to fifty individuals in the True Yuan Realm and Separation and Union Realm.

This group was being led by a young woman in her twenties, flying toward Lingxiao Pavilion. In no time, they arrived at the sect’s entrance.

“This is where the evil lord was born?” The young woman, blooming like a flower, was tall, with bright eyes and white teeth, and skin as fair as snow. She wore a luxurious purple gown, further accentuating her noble demeanor.

With a faint smile on her lips, a hint of disdain and confusion flashed in her eyes. She said lightly, “Just a second-rate sect; how could it possibly cultivate a figure like the evil lord?”

Behind her stepped a man in white, fanning himself with a folding fan, who smiled, “Miss Qiu, although this is just a second-rate sect, it hides dragons and crouching tigers, with experts in hiding. We shouldn’t underestimate it. Last time, I and Brother Fan suffered a great loss here!”

This man in white was none other than Bai Yunfeng, who had been defeated by Yang Kai last time.

Since his defeat, Bai Yunfeng had been eager for revenge but had been cautious of Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya’s strength, always missing the opportunity to take action.

Hearing that the Qiu Family from Zhongdu was sending people to Lingxiao Pavilion, he immediately volunteered to follow, hoping to find a chance to redeem his humiliation.

Although he spoke to Miss Qiu with a smile, he unconsciously kept three steps behind her, showing a respectful demeanor without a hint of arrogance typical of a young master from a prominent family. His gaze was clear and untainted, resting on the delicate shoulder of the young woman without a trace of lewdness.

Bai Yunfeng was also a perceptive person; his identity as a young master from a first-rate family was impressive on the outside, but in front of this young woman, it meant nothing.

This young woman was none other than Qiu Yimeng, the eldest daughter of the Qiu Family from Zhongdu.

The Qiu Family was not something the Bai Family could compare to.

Not to mention the Qiu Family’s background, just Qiu Yimeng alone, at only twenty-one years old, had already reached the Ninth Stage of the True Yuan Realm. Such talent was rare in the world.

Moreover, she was not only exceptionally talented but also possessed stunning beauty.

With such a prodigious woman from the Qiu Family, which young master from the other seven families, aside from the Yang Family, did not wish to marry her?

However, the head of the Qiu Family, Qiu Shoucheng, had stated that if one wished to marry Qiu Yimeng, they must enter the Qiu Family!

In the future… any children born must also bear the surname Qiu!

This requirement immediately extinguished the fervent thoughts of many, yet still, numerous young masters lingered around Qiu Yimeng, hoping to have some wonderful encounters with such a beauty.

Qiu Yimeng herself was relatively disciplined, treating those young masters with indifference and having no deep thoughts. The reason she came to Lingxiao Pavilion this time was also due to being bothered too much in Zhongdu, so she specifically came out to relax and, incidentally, to experience some training.

Hearing Bai Yunfeng’s words, Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly, not turning her head, as she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, saying, “I heard that Young Master Bai, during your last battle with a young disciple from Lingxiao Pavilion, even lost a treasure?”

Bai Yunfeng’s expression turned bitter, secretly cursing the person for bringing up such a topic, but he maintained a humble smile on his face, “I, Bai, lack skill; please don’t laugh at me, Miss Qiu.”

As the two conversed, another stunning young woman appeared beside them. This girl was petite and delicate, standing half a head shorter than Qiu Yimeng, but her ample bosom was quite eye-catching.
