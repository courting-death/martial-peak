## Chapter 991 — Are the Good Days Over?

Conversing off and on with that youth called Shen Tu, Yang Kai deliberately probed for the information he wanted, and he gained a great deal.

Gradually, he came to understand some basic facts.

He was now in a Star Domain known as the Hengluo Star Domain. Though vast in scope and encompassing countless stars, it was still but a small part of the boundless universe.

Within the Hengluo Star Domain, several enormous powers dominated the fate of the region.

The Sword Alliance counted as one, Purple Star as another; besides them there were the Hengluo Commerce Guild, the Spine of the Star River, and the Abandoned Nest—various forces each controlling their own territories across the Star Domain.

Beneath these top-tier powers there were countless other factions of all sizes.

To judge whether a force was truly powerful, one must see whether it had the means to deploy warships.

Generally, any faction that possessed warships—those super-large Secret Treasures—could be considered a power in its own right, for warships were expensive to build and even more costly to maintain.

From the rows of Saint Crystals arranged in the engine room, one could see how much energy such a super-large Secret Treasure consumed while running.

A typical small faction simply lacked that capability.

“These great powers each administer multiple cultivation stars—some have as few as two or three, others seven or eight; they’re not all the same.” Shen Tu clearly knew much more about the Star Domain than Yang Kai; seeing that Yang Kai seemed completely ignorant, he spoke plainly and without concealment.

“Cultivation stars?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Stars suited for sentient life and cultivation,” Shen Tu explained patiently. “The universe is vast and the stars are countless, but for various reasons most of them aren’t suitable for living or cultivating; those that are suitable are called cultivation stars.”

“I see.” Yang Kai nodded slightly to indicate he understood.

“But the stars unsuitable for habitation aren’t without value—some produce rare ores, some have abundant Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine; those are called mineral stars and medicine stars, and every great power holds many of them. The resources from those stars let them develop themselves. Of course, there are also dead stars—worlds shrouded in lifelessness, with no minerals, no medicinal substances, not even Heaven-and-Earth Energy.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help feeling moved.

On Tongxuan Continent, great powers would often fight to the death over a small piece of ground. But in this entire Star Domain, there were forces that controlled multiple stars.

It was something he had never even dared to imagine before.

Compared to the splendors of the Star Domain, Tongxuan Continent suddenly paled in comparison.

“Each cultivation star has a star lord; the star lord is the supreme ruler of that cultivation star. If one day you and I could get to that height, our lives wouldn’t have been in vain,” Shen Tu chuckled, a look of longing flickering in his eyes.

“What level of cultivation does a star lord have?”

“Unfathomable. Any star lord could destroy a Saint King-level Upper-Level warship with the snap of a finger!” Shen Tu drew a deep breath.

Yang Kai was momentarily speechless.

Although Shen Tu didn’t tell him exactly what a star lord’s cultivation was, he could guess that it was absolutely beyond the Saint King Realm.

Above the Saint King Realm there were even higher levels!

“Look outside.” Shen Tu signaled quietly.

Yang Kai followed his gaze and saw the huge, beautiful stars beyond the warship.

The engine room sat at the very bottom of the warship and was also responsible for its direction and speed, so from inside the engine room one could see outside.

Transparent yet sturdy windows had been forged from some unknown material all around, and through them the entire surrounding scene was visible.

“What do you make of these stars?” Shen Tu asked.

“The Heaven-and-Earth Energy they contain is beyond imagination!” Yang Kai replied gravely; even when he was lost in the Chaos Abyss he had been horrified by the energy contained in those stars.

“Indeed. Across the whole Hengluo Star Domain no cultivation star can compare to any of the stars here. All the forces within the Star Domain desperately want to develop the stars in the Chaos Abyss; whether the world is blistering with heat or bone-chilling with cold, each is suited to some elemental attribute of a cultivator. Training there grants anyone unimaginable benefits.”

“But I heard it’s dangerous—this place is a forbidden area of the Star Domain; the fields emitted by those stars make everything chaotic.”

“Yes; precisely because their energies are so vast they produce those chaotic fields that lead people astray. That’s why the Chaos Abyss has always been a forbidden zone of the starry sky—no one has developed it, let alone dared to cultivate on those stars.”

“Then this warship…”

“Don’t worry. Every warship carries top-tier Star Charts, and there are chartmasters aboard who are experts at drawing Star Charts, so a warship won’t lose its way here. That’s their assurance for daring to break in. Star Shuttles aren’t the same—if affected by the chaotic fields their Star Charts are easily damaged, so no one dares to pilot a Star Shuttle here alone.”

“If that’s all, this place still wouldn’t be called a forbidden area of the Star Domain—are there other dangers?” Yang Kai suddenly realized another question.

“There are.” Shen Tu nodded gravely. “But no one can say exactly what kinds of dangers, because those who enter here never return alive.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted as his thoughts raced; suddenly he barked, “If that’s the case, whatever the two sisters hold must be something Purple Star urgently wants, otherwise they wouldn’t risk sending a Saint King-level Upper-Level warship in.”

Shen Tu was taken aback, thought carefully, and then nodded in agreement. “I hadn’t noticed that either, but what could be so valuable that Purple Star would send a Saint King-level Upper-Level warship into the Chaos Abyss?”

He pondered deeply but gained nothing.

At that moment a cry came from a corner of the engine room: “Lord Bi Ya and the others have returned!”

Yang Kai and Shen Tu exchanged a glance and both turned to look out of the cabin.

Sure enough, two streaks of azure light shot rapidly toward them from the icy starry sky.

“Your good days are over.” Shen Tu looked at Yang Kai with some sympathy. “What will you do? That bitch has come back; she won’t let you go. Let me be clear: she wants you for herself—I can’t help you with that.”

“Not necessarily!” Yang Kai’s eyes brightened as he stared fixedly at the two rapidly approaching azure lights; it seemed he had noticed something else.

“What do you mean?” Shen Tu asked, puzzled—he couldn’t understand why Yang Kai wasn’t at all worried.

“There were three when they left, but now there are only two…something must have happened.” Yang Kai said sharply.

Shen Tu was astonished and looked again; indeed there were only two streaks of azure light.

After a moment, two figures appeared below the warship.

“Only Lord Bi Ya and Lord Liu Shan—Lord Liu Sha is not here!” a cultivator nearby cried out. “And Lord Bi Ya and Lord Liu Shan both seem wounded.”

“What’s going on!” Ke Meng strode out of the darkness and asked coldly.

“No idea; I’m asking.” the man said, pouring his divine sense into a compass-like Secret Treasure in his hand as if communicating with someone.

Outside the warship Liu Shan also took out a similarly shaped Secret Treasure.

Yang Kai immediately understood: that treasure must be used for long-distance communication; when he was previously taken away by Liu Shan and the others he had seen Liu Shan use one.

Looking out through the engine room window, he really did see Liu Shan and Bi Ya looking bedraggled and wounded, bloodied and like survivors snatched from the jaws of death. The beautiful woman Bi Ya had none of her earlier grace and charm; her pretty face was full of panic and rage as she kept glancing back as if someone was pursuing them.

“Ha! You actually guessed it right.” Shen Tu looked outside, shouting gleefully with schadenfreude: “Serves them right—charging into the Chaos Abyss so recklessly. Now they’ve really suffered a loss, haven’t they?”

“They look injured from fighting; things aren’t that simple.” Yang Kai pondered.

“Uh…”

“The two sisters I saw were one at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm and the other at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—there’s no way they should be opponents for Liu Shan and the others, yet now there are two wounded and one dead returning…”

“There are others in the Chaos Abyss?” Shen Tu immediately caught on. “And definitely experts of the Saint King Realm!”

“People from the Sword Alliance!” Yang Kai snapped.

“Haha, this will be entertaining—even the Sword Alliance came into the Chaos Abyss; they’ll definitely fight. If they fight, we’ll have a chance.” Shen Tu’s eyes shone brightly in the dark.

“We’ll see.” Yang Kai also privately hoped; in the current situation, if nothing happened he would only face being taken by Bi Ya.

He had no desire to die beneath a woman’s belly.

So he was more than happy for the situation to get as chaotic as possible.

“It is the Sword Alliance—their warship has arrived here too!” the cultivator who had been communicating with Liu Shan shouted, confirming Yang Kai and Shen Tu’s guess.

“What?” Ke Meng’s face changed. “They’re really bold!”

As soon as he spoke he suddenly realized that on their side there was also a warship, and his expression darkened.

In the time it took to exchange a few words, the cultivator who had been speaking with Liu Shan earlier had already opened the warship’s hatch, letting them rush inside.

“Where are the Sword Alliance people?” Shen Tu pressed a hand to his forehead, scanning left and right with no discovery, feeling some disappointment.

“If I were with the Sword Alliance, after finding those two sisters I’d leave the Chaos Abyss immediately instead of chasing Purple Star’s warship to do battle!” Yang Kai said leisurely.
