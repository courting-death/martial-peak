## Chapter 171 — Flame Yang Triple Explosion and Footwork

In the following days, Yang Kai continued to immerse himself in the charm and scenery of Haicheng. The coastal views were breathtaking, and the air was fresh and natural, making it a wonderful place to reside.

In the tea houses and taverns, Yang Kai also heard many unique tales belonging to this seaside city. He even witnessed the phenomenon known as a mirage firsthand.

Such beauty truly made it hard for him to tear himself away.

There were also sects in the vicinity, and quite a few of them.

If one were to categorize the various forces by rank, the eight great families of Zhongdu would be considered a superpower, while Lingxiao Pavilion could at most be classified as a second-tier force. The sects in this area varied in strength, with some being first-tier and others second or third-tier.

There were even some that could faintly rival superpowers.

These forces were different from those in the inland; they occupied islands in the sea, claiming various islands for themselves and enjoying the cultivation resources found there. It was a place of exceptional talent and beautiful scenery, attracting many to seek apprenticeship and learn the arts.

However, in Haicheng, apart from a few family forces, there were rarely any martial artists to be seen. The reason for this was likely because these forces were distributed across the islands, where the energy of heaven and earth was superior to that of the inland. On the islands, the speed of cultivation was also faster. Generally, the martial artists from those forces would not venture inland unless absolutely necessary. Thus, the number of martial artists in Haicheng was not only small, but their strength was also not particularly high.

After experiencing the prosperity of Haicheng, Yang Kai took a stroll by the sea, witnessing the ebb and flow of the tides and the surging waves. As the waves crashed against the shore, a flash of inspiration struck him, and he vaguely grasped the commonality between his understanding and the martial traces left by Old Wu.

That was nature—one should not force things but act according to their nature, just like the waves crashing in succession. When encountering obstacles, they would shatter into countless droplets, only to gather again into a torrent.

Before his eyes, it seemed as if a great door was slowly opening.

Not daring to be negligent, Yang Kai stood quietly, merging his insights with Old Wu's martial path.

He did not know how long it had been, but Yang Kai stood as if asleep on the beach, with only the sound of the whimpering sea breeze and the crashing waves in his ears. When he finally opened his eyes again, his entire demeanor had changed slightly, and his spirit had undergone an indescribable sublimation and baptism.

He unleashed his self-created footwork. Yang Kai's figure became ethereal, stepping onto the incoming waves as if walking on solid ground. He leaped from one wave to another, not a drop of water touching him.

In a flash, then another… his figure flickered fifteen times before a breath of Yuan Qi was finally released, splashing down into the sea, soaking him completely.

Yet Yang Kai was smiling, facing the towering waves, and slowly unleashed a punch.

Flame Yang Triple Explosion!

The air was filled with three rapid explosions, and three streams of Yuan Qi surged forth from his fist, creating a hole in the massive wave.

At this moment, the martial traces Yang Kai had gleaned from Old Wu had fully integrated into him, and he had also added a variation inspired by the waves.

This change was realized in the Flame Yang Explosion; now, when he unleashed it, it was no longer a one-time explosion. Instead, three streams of Yuan Qi surged forth, each stronger than the last, like waves crashing in succession, making it difficult to defend against.

“Genius!” The Earth Demon was utterly speechless. Just days ago, when Yang Kai was comprehending, he had been astonished. He never expected that so soon, Yang Kai would gain even deeper insights based on his previous foundation.

Has the world changed so much while I have been away? The Earth Demon felt a pang of melancholy.

Climbing out of the sea, drenched, Yang Kai suddenly noticed a little girl not far from where he had just stood. She had a wheat-colored complexion and messy hair, staring blankly at him.

The little girl appeared to be only seven or eight years old, with bright, expressive eyes. She wore a coarse cloth garment patched in many places and had bare feet. Her small mouth was slightly open, and as the sea breeze blew in, she quickly closed it.

People living by the sea often had skin that was not too fair due to prolonged exposure to the wind and sun, so the little girl's complexion was quite normal, giving off a healthy vibe.

Yang Kai put on a smile, adopting a gentle and harmless demeanor, and approached her step by step, secretly feeling guilty for not noticing her presence when he had just awakened from his insights. He must have frightened her.

Seeing her expression, which seemed quite frightened, Yang Kai dared not use his Yuan Qi to dry his clothes and walked over, still dripping wet.

He squatted down in front of her, wearing a friendly smile, and softly asked, “Little girl, what are you doing here?”

The little girl blinked her big eyes, still gazing at him. Her innocent and pure eyes held no impurities, and under such scrutiny, even though Yang Kai had done nothing wrong, he felt a bit uncomfortable. If someone with a guilty conscience were to be here, they would likely be purified on the spot.

After a moment, she extended her hands and offered him something.

Yang Kai looked down and found it was a grilled fish.

Living by the sea, fishermen naturally made fish their staple food.

“For me?” Yang Kai felt a warmth in his heart.

The little girl gently nodded, shoving the grilled fish into Yang Kai's hands before running off, leaving a trail of clear little footprints in the sand, utterly adorable.

Not far into her run, she suddenly stopped, turned back to look at Yang Kai.

Then, she returned, walked up to Yang Kai, and tugged at his clothes, leading him in a certain direction.

Yang Kai did not resist; he had no idea what this little girl wanted, but she seemed so innocent and lovely that he was sure she meant no harm.

After walking a short distance, they arrived in front of a simple house. The little girl pointed inside.

“Shall we go in?” Yang Kai asked, and the little girl nodded.

With a light laugh, Yang Kai thought that she had brought him home as a guest. Before he could take a step, an old man suddenly walked out of the house. The elder was quite old, and the years had left many merciless marks on his face. Moreover, he walked with a slight limp.

The old man noticed the little girl and Yang Kai, his expression startled.

To avoid any misunderstanding, Yang Kai quickly spoke, “Elder, is this little girl your family member?”

The old man smiled kindly, waving to the little girl, “Xiao Yu, come here.”

The little girl shook her head, tugging at Yang Kai's clothes with all her might, pulling him inside.

The old man looked at Yang Kai with a smile, “If the young man doesn’t mind, please come in and sit for a while. Xiao Yu is worried you might get cold and wants to take you in to dry your clothes.”

Yang Kai immediately understood; it turned out the little girl had returned to bring him in for this reason. With such good intentions, how could he bear to refuse?

“Thank you for your hospitality.”

Following Xiao Yu into the house, Yang Kai glanced around and felt a pang of sadness. This home could truly be described as bare; apart from a bed and a few tattered quilts, there was nothing else.

In Haicheng, Yang Kai had witnessed the extravagant lifestyles of the wealthy, but just a short distance from the city, on the beach, there were still a grandfather and granddaughter living in such dire conditions. This scene was truly shocking.

Xiao Yu busied herself, lighting the charcoal fire and pulling Yang Kai closer to warm his clothes.

The charcoal fire was lit indoors, as the sea breeze outside was too strong. As the flames rose, smoke filled the room, causing the old man to cough a few times.

There were no chairs, so Yang Kai did not mind sitting on the ground with them.

“You must be a martial artist, young man?” the old man asked, placing Xiao Yu on his lap.

“How can you tell?” Yang Kai was somewhat surprised. He had concealed his aura, and without making a move, even a True Yuan Realm martial artist would not be able to discern his true nature, unless they were a Divine Roaming Realm expert who had cultivated their Divine Sense.

To his astonishment, an old fisherman by the sea had seen through him. This left Yang Kai a bit taken aback.

The old man chuckled a few times, “You’ve been standing by the sea for several days without moving. How could an ordinary person endure that?”

“Several days?” Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart. The last time he fell into comprehension, he had also lost track of time. It seemed that if he were to comprehend something again, he must find a good place; otherwise, if danger suddenly arose, he might not even know how he died.

“Xiao Yu comes to check on you every day. If it weren’t for that, do you think an old man like me would dare to let you into my house?” 

“I’m not a bad person,” Yang Kai said with an awkward smile.

While they spoke, Xiao Yu had been watching Yang Kai. Seeing him holding the grilled fish without taking a bite, she pointed at it again.

“Alright, I’ll eat. Xiao Yu is really good!” Yang Kai took a bite of the fish. Although it was cold, it was still tender, and he couldn’t help but nod repeatedly, “Delicious.”

Only then did Xiao Yu reveal a hint of a smile.

After finishing the grilled fish, Yang Kai’s clothes had dried. He hesitated several times before finally speaking, “Elder, Xiao Yu doesn’t speak?”

A trace of sadness appeared on the old man’s face as he stroked Xiao Yu’s head, “It’s not that; it’s just that some changes happened in the family, and since then, she hasn’t spoken.”

“Oh.” Yang Kai sighed inwardly. He had initially thought that Xiao Yu had a congenital condition, and he could find someone to help her heal. But it turned out she simply chose not to speak. This was a mental block; unless it was resolved, she would not open her mouth.

The old man clearly did not wish to discuss this matter further, and Yang Kai did not press on, lest he bring up painful memories.

“It’s getting late. If the young man doesn’t mind, you can stay here for the night.” The old man stood up shakily, and Xiao Yu quickly helped him.

“Then I’ll impose.” Yang Kai stood and gave a slight bow.

The house was not large; the old man and Xiao Yu slept on the bed while Yang Kai lay on the ground, listening to the howling wind outside, unable to fall asleep.

He had thought his life in Lingxiao Pavilion over the past three years was already quite hard, but now, compared to them, what was it worth?

This old man and little girl, apart from occasionally catching a few fish, how could they sustain themselves?

In the middle of the night, in a daze, Yang Kai suddenly heard footsteps outside.

He jolted awake.

Before coming here, Yang Kai had already observed that there were no signs of anyone else living nearby; there was only this one house with the grandfather and granddaughter.

Moreover, judging by the footsteps, the person approaching was actually a martial artist!

As Yang Kai was filled with suspicion, the old man sleeping on the bed suddenly sat up. In the darkness, Yang Kai clearly saw the look of extreme panic on his face.
