## Chapter 2065 — Dead End

"Jiang Family!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "No — I'm here to find someone."

"Senior really isn't from the Jiang Family?" Zhou Kang's voice rose a few tones, disbelief plain on his face; at once the other warriors all looked at Yang Kai with brightening eyes, the gloomy, vacant gazes bursting into light as if they had glimpsed hope in the dark.

"Why would I lie to you?" Yang Kai barked impatiently.

"I believe you, Senior!" Zhou Kang no longer dared to question him and cried aloud, "If you are not of the Jiang Family, please save us from this torment."

"Senior, save us!"

"Please, we're begging you—let us out!"

A chorus of pleas rose up; the warriors shackled and deprived of freedom looked at Yang Kai with beseeching eyes.

Zhou Kang said, "To be frank, most of us are scattered fighters with no family or backing; some come from small clans. We were captured by the Jiang Family at different times and brought here to mine. Any resistance was punished; some brothers are already dead. We cannot bear the torment — it is unbearable!"

"What minerals were you mining here?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Please, Senior, take a look at this!" Zhou Kang hurriedly took something from a nearby basket and respectfully handed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai accepted the item, glanced at it, and let out a soft exclamation, "Qingxin Jade?"

He recognized it — an exceedingly rare jade that could clear the mind and purify spirit, with very special effects for cultivators when they closed themselves to refine a technique or when they broke through a Realm. Wearing such a piece could greatly offset the harm of heart demons.

If worn long-term, it also had other hidden benefits.

For that reason, the jade was expensive; a thumb‑nail sized piece cost two to three thousand Source Crystals, and the one Zhou Kang casually produced was palm‑sized — worth at least one hundred thousand Source Crystals!

Not to mention the basket was filled with many more pieces of Qingxin Jade!

This place was, astonishingly, a mine of Qingxin Jade!

No wonder the Jiang Family operated in such secrecy and did not want discovery. With such enormous profits, if other forces learned of it, the Jiang Family alone could not withstand them — even the city lord's mansion would certainly step in to take a share!

But mining such things required manpower, and the Jiang Family did not have enough. They could only steal labor from others!

Those below the Saint King Realm, with no family ties, no background, and no protector, were the best candidates.

Fenglin City was not large in the Southern Territory and the general level of cultivators was not high, but there were crowds day after day; losing a few cultivators below the Saint King Realm from time to time would likely go unnoticed.

Zhou Kang and the others had been seized and brought to the mine to work as laborers in exactly that way.

Zhang Ruoxi was evidently the same!

In a short time Yang Kai had pieced everything together and understood why the Jiang Family had been unwilling to reveal Zhang Ruoxi's whereabouts, why they pretended ignorance when he inquired, and why they remained unmoved even when he showed the proper conditions.

It turned out they dared not reveal the secret of this mine.

Realizing this, a cold light flashed across Yang Kai's eyes.

"Senior..." Zhou Kang watched Yang Kai warily, unsure what he was thinking now.

"Leave the goods and go." Yang Kai waved his hand dismissively.

"Ah?" Zhou Kang froze, appearing bewildered.

Yang Kai raised his hand and the mine filled with swirling golden light; strands of Golden Blood Threads shot forth and, with a series of cracking sounds, the chains and shackles that bound Zhou Kang and the others were sliced in two.

"I said you can leave — or would you rather stay?" Yang Kai glanced at Zhou Kang and, without waiting for an answer, swept his hand and absorbed all the Qingxin Jade that lay on the ground into his Spatial Ring, then hurriedly flew forward.

After a moment, cheers and excited shouts rose from not far behind Yang Kai; seeing their chains cut, the liberated warriors had no doubt about his words, and the impatient among them rushed toward the exit.

"By the way, Senior—don’t go too deep. There’s something strange at the very end!" Zhou Kang, elated for a moment, suddenly remembered and hurriedly shouted to Yang Kai.

But there was no trace of Yang Kai; he had already pressed deeper into the mine and disappeared.

"Senior must have heard it, right?" Zhou Kang cocked his head, pondered for a moment, then let the matter go. Taken by the Jiang Family for a full two years, he had believed he would never escape and would die in this pit. He had never imagined that a benefactor would appear today, granting him a chance to see daylight again.

Overcome with excitement, Zhou Kang ran out, shouting loudly as he went.

In short order the whole mine was in an uproar; the countless captured cultivators who had been forced to mine rushed out, pouring out their joy at regaining freedom.

In the depths of the mine, Yang Kai followed a small beast and rushed on; along the way he stowed every piece of Qingxin Jade he found, and he also cut the wrist and ankle chains off the mining slaves.

Meanwhile, in a farther corner of the deepest mine, a frail figure was running inward.

With her movements came a clattering — the sound of the shackles striking as they were dragged behind her.

Her slight figure was clothed in rags, hair matted and covering her brow; her face was smeared black so that her true features were all but lost. Yet from the way she kept looking over her shoulder, the panic fluttering in her eyes, one could still discern a faint shadow of Zhang Ruoxi.

Surviving in this mine had not been easy; since she had been sent here a month ago, Zhang Ruoxi had encountered darkness and fear she had never known in ten years.

Aside from the Jiang Family's harsh demands — that each day they had to dig up a required quota or suffer punishment — the other miners were not to be trifled with. After being captured and tormented, their temperaments had changed; seeing a frail girl naturally drew interest from many.

Fortunately Zhang Ruoxi now cultivated at the peak of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, otherwise she could never have kept her footing here; she would have been picked clean to the bone long ago.

When a few thoughtless fellows leered at Zhang Ruoxi and tried to grope her, she had taught them a harsh lesson, and afterwards no one dared trouble her.

To avoid further trouble she had deliberately made herself look neither human nor ghost, and indeed no one paid her any more heed, granting her a measure of peace.

But the daily toil of mining was brutal: Qingxin Jade was embedded within the rock and required great effort to extract.

In just a month the girl's hands and feet had lost several layers of skin; her already slight frame grew yet more thin. Every night after work she went to sleep in tears, enduring pain, and woke only to endure it again.

Born and spoiled in the Zhang Family and cherished as a pearl by the family's matriarch, Zhang Ruoxi had never dreamed the world contained such darkness.

She missed her great‑grandmother, she missed her grandmother, she missed every person in the Zhang Family.

Each time those thoughts came, another face flickered before her eyes.

It was Sir Yang, the one who had once saved the Zhang Family and had not returned since he left half a year ago!

She had little contact with him; though she had stayed by his side for a while, he never made any demands of her. He did not require service — he let her rest in the cavehouse quietly, train each day, and even gave her a precious Spiritual Pill.

She felt Sir Yang was a good man and had been very kind to her.

She trained hard and did not slack off because he had said she might be needed someday; she wanted to raise her strength to repay his kindness.

But now...

"Sir Yang, where are you?" Zhang Ruoxi cried inwardly as she stumbled through the mine tunnels, using her knowledge of the passages to dodge the pursuit behind her.

At the most dangerous moment of her life, the only person on her mind was that one man — she wished he would descend like a god to stand before her, stop the storm and offer absolute safety.

But she knew that was impossible; the mine was hidden beyond reach and no one would discover it.

A demonic low growl sounded behind her: "Bitch, you're dead. Run as you will; if I catch you I'll make you taste every human torture!"

Zhang Ruoxi's delicate body trembled violently; terror filled her heart, and her feet felt as if filled with lead — she could barely move.

She had already lost her shoes in the flight; her bare feet trod on the cold, damp tunnel floor, sharp stones stabbing them until they bled. The pain dulled into numbness as she mechanically forced herself forward into a side passage.

She fell and struggled to rise; her vision blurred and she nearly fainted.

She bit her tongue hard — the sharp pain forced her mind to focus. After judging the directions around her, she gritted her teeth and dashed off in one direction.

It was a place that all the mining slaves avoided.

A few had once gone there to mine and never returned; since then no one dared go.

Now that place of death had become her only hope of escape.

In the silent tunnel Zhang Ruoxi's rapid breathing sounded; she could even hear her heart pounding fiercely in her chest like a war drum threatening to burst free.

After running a long time, Zhang Ruoxi suddenly stopped, staring ahead in stunned despair.

Ahead was a dead end — there was no way out!

At that moment, footsteps sounded from behind: step, step, step.

Step by step, the sound closed in behind her like Death whispering its summons at her ear. Zhang Ruoxi turned, her face pale as paper; her beautiful eyes seemed veiled by dark clouds, overflowing with despair, unable to see even the faintest glimmer of light.
