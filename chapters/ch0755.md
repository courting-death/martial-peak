## Chapter 755 — Sorry

To stand shoulder to shoulder with the Saint Lord, one must at the very least enter the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

An Ling'er did not believe Yang Kai could accomplish that; she simply thought him a young man with an impetuous mouth, prone to boasting.

"Just watch." Yang Kai chuckled, confidence radiating across his face.

"You really won't reconsider?"

"No need." Yang Kai shook his head. "Besides, your method for choosing a Saint Lord is far too careless—can the head of a major power really decide something so casually?"

"It's not careless at all!" An Ling'er retorted, excited. "Our cultivation method is tied to finding a Saint Lord—if there's a suitable candidate within a certain range, we the Saintesses can sense them. Such a candidate is the optimal choice. Someone like you falls into a different selection category; if we truly can't find the first kind of person, the Sacred Land must step in to scout promising youngsters and attempt to instill their doctrines to see if they can comprehend the Sacred Land's divine techniques… Today's incident was an accident, but you still passed my test and qualify to enter the Sacred Land. In fact, your performance was outstanding—you're highly qualified!"

Yang Kai snorted. "Can you guarantee those chosen will be utterly loyal to your Sacred Land, with no second thoughts?"

"They will!" An Ling'er nodded solemnly. "Once they enter the Sacred Land, they'll change their minds."

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; though he wasn't fully sure of the inner workings, he suspected the Nine Heavens Sacred Land employed special methods to brainwash their selections.

"Alright, let's drop that for now." Yang Kai didn't want to pry further into the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's secrets—knowing too much would only harm him. As he spoke, a refined energy suddenly burst from his spirit body and, before An Ling'er could react, enveloped her.

"What are you doing?" An Ling'er's delicate face changed; she was speaking one moment and found herself incapable of movement the next. Yang Kai's Divine Sense was far stronger than she'd calculated, and the energy that wrapped her spirit body carried a searing heat.

Yang Kai appraised her from head to toe, his gaze flickering with complex light. He nodded slightly. "Yes, by my temperament, I should kill you to silence you."

"Kill me to silence me?" An Ling'er's face went pale. "Do you think I know too much?"

"That's one reason." Yang Kai nodded candidly. "I know enough that if you return alive, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land won't spare me—either they'll drag me back to serve as your Saint Lord, or they'll kill me outright to protect their secrets. Neither outcome suits me."

"Why are you so suspicious?" An Ling'er frowned and gazed at him distantly. "I won't tell anyone about today. And don't forget I saved you before—you can't repay kindness with ingratitude."

"Don't bring that up." Yang Kai tossed his mouth. "Honestly, I didn't know what to do with you. If I killed you I'd never be at peace and might develop a mental vice, yet if I let you go I couldn't trust you."

Hearing him, An Ling'er's tension visibly eased, and she whispered, "So have you decided what to do now?"

"Indeed!" Yang Kai grinned and reached out with a large hand toward her spirit body.

An Ling'er looked terrified and tried to struggle, but she couldn't move at all.

Just before that hand touched her, it suddenly withdrew.

An irresistible pull radiated from his palm; An Ling'er's vision blurred, and her spirit body sagged weakly, utterly exhausted.

She stubbornly raised her head and glared at Yang Kai with pure hatred, gritting her teeth: "So you didn't learn only two divine techniques after all!"

"Sorry, actually three!" Yang Kai smiled brightly. "This move is called Juntian Draw."

An Ling'er pressed her lips and said nothing.

"Xuantian Sword, Youtian Lock, Juntian Draw…" Yang Kai murmured. "Your Nine Heavens Sacred Land's divine techniques are indeed good—practical and effective."

"Practical? Those are the fruits of over a decade of my cultivation!" An Ling'er bristled at his appraisal.

Yang Kai paid it no mind and stared at the subtle spirit-energy mass in his hand. The energy stripped from An Ling'er's spirit body had been reduced a millionfold; she sat cross-legged within his palm, small and delicate, solemn as a statue, utterly motionless.

This was the imprint of An Ling'er's spirit!

With that imprint in hand, Yang Kai could control An Ling'er's life and death at will.

“For safety’s sake, I’ll keep your imprint. Hopefully once we leave here, we’ll part ways at the ends of the world and never cross paths again. Hm… and when the day comes that I can stand as an equal with your Sacred Lord, I’ll go to your Nine Heavens Sacred Land and return this brand to you.” Yang Kai said as he drew her brand into his Spirit Body.

An Ling'er glowered at him angrily, powerless to resist.

Though she also knew Juntian Draw, her Divine Sense cultivation was inferior to Yang Kai's; she couldn't resist even if she tried.

This man was despicable to the extreme—she had offered him a proposal that heavily favored him, and he refused; worse, he schemed to control her.

"Hey, I truly harbor no malice toward you—don't look at me like that." Yang Kai shook his head helplessly.

"You're detestable!" An Ling'er cursed through her teeth, venting her grievance.

"Alright, alright, I'm detestable—I'm the most detestable man in the world. Rest up and don't get sick from anger." Yang Kai hurried to soothe her. With her spirit imprint taken, he felt considerably more at ease.

Though this would cause some damage to her, a period of recuperation would set her right. Yang Kai had taken only her imprint and hadn't harmed her spirit body.

Pouting in a huff, An Ling'er ignored him and sat alone to the side, looking pitiably forlorn.

Yang Kai observed for a while, then vaulted out and flew away.

The white, misty world was indeed the interior of that Divine Soul Secret Treasure; Yang Kai had roughly deduced the artifact's function—it could forcibly pull another's spirit body into this strange space, just as those before had experienced.

This was a valuable tool for Yang Kai.

His Divine Sense cultivation now exceeded his physical body; when he met an overwhelmingly powerful enemy, employing this treasure's might could force an opponent into a Divine Sense duel with him.

In such a fight, Yang Kai might hold considerable advantage.

Thus he was eager to claim the secret treasure for himself.

The hundred or so who had entered earlier had searched the place several times without finding anything special; the only mysterious spot left was the position in the sky where four great characters—Court of Divine Battle—were inscribed.

Flying to where the four characters hung, Yang Kai examined them closely, his expression utterly focused.

Time passed slowly. An Ling'er recovered from her earlier injury and, blinking her big eyes, floated up to stand beside Yang Kai. "Are you looking for an exit, or intending to refine this treasure?" she asked.

"Not angry anymore?" Yang Kai glanced at her in surprise. He'd noticed how quickly she seemed to forget; earlier he'd given her the cold shoulder several times and driven her off, yet she always returned soon after.

"I'm angry!" An Ling'er nodded heavily, "But I've decided not to sulk for now—getting out alive is the priority."

"Wise girl!" Yang Kai chuckled. "I plan to refine the treasure. Since it's a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, I can use Divine Sense to refine it, but I haven't found a proper direction. Any suggestions?"

An Ling'er looked carefully and pondered a moment. "Try refining the four characters themselves—they may be the core. If you stamp your Divine Sense into those characters, you might be able to claim it."

"That's what I thought." Yang Kai nodded and said in a serious tone, "Stand back a little."

An Ling'er eyed him oddly but, though puzzled, obediently moved to the very edge.

Looking up, she saw Yang Kai's spirit body seated in the void, as if conjuring something, utterly still.

Suddenly, a violent, horrifying heat expanded outward from him; a blinding golden light flared, and the entire Court of Divine Battle seemed to tremble.

The four characters were engulfed in raging flames and burned fiercely.

An Ling'er's mouth opened in astonishment as she stared, her body trembling.

She had thought Yang Kai cultivated some special soul technique or possessed a Divine Soul Secret Treasure that made his spirit body burn, but now she realized his spirit burned because of his Divine Sense power itself!

Mutated Divine Sense—Divine Sense Fire? An Ling'er was completely shocked.

And judging by his manner, his command of Divine Sense had clearly reached a very high level.

No wonder he took her spirit imprint—not to learn some Sacred Land secrets, but because of his own reasons.

He clearly hoped she would keep this secret.

This might actually save them: Divine Sense Fire's power far surpasses ordinary Divine Sense, and this man's force was extraordinary; even if the secret treasure were of high grade, it might not withstand such ferocious burning.

While elated, An Ling'er's mind still pondered how to make Yang Kai agree to accompany her to the Sacred Land.

A Saint Lord with Divine Sense Fire! Such a precedent had never appeared in the Sacred Land; with this talent and means, if he became Saint Lord he would undoubtedly be the most formidable in history!
