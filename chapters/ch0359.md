## Chapter 359 — The Might of a First-Class Family

Hu Jiao’er was usually more assertive than her sister, and although she would respectfully refer to Elder Fang as ‘senior’ on regular occasions, at this moment, upon seeing him about to kill Yang Kai, she couldn't help but hurl an insult at him, calling him an old fool.

Elder Fang's face turned ashen with anger, but he couldn’t lose his temper given this woman’s identity. Instead, he maintained a stern expression and said, “Look at him like this; isn’t he in a demonic state?”

Hu Jiao’er snorted coldly, “If he were in a demonic state, could we still stand beside him safely? Are your eyes blind or something?”

Both Elder Fang and Elder Xu were taken aback and, after thinking it over, felt a bit confused. Yang Kai’s current state was entirely beyond their comprehension. Under that soaring killing intent, it was impossible for him to still have his wits about him. However, looking into his eyes, he was manifestly calm and composed, lacking any signs of being in a demonic state.

“Furthermore, you only saw him kill Cheng Ming; have you considered what that old man did to him?” Hu Jiao’er raised her voice in questioning.

Elder Fang moved his mouth, stammered for a moment, and finally said, “I only believe what I have seen myself.”

Hu Jiao’er laughed coldly, “Half a month ago, Leiguang and the people from Feihong Courtyard suffered a great loss at his hands. Now they have left the battlefield early and returned here. I think you can guess their purpose. Even if Yang Kai did kill them, it was out of self-defense. Those dead were all asking for it; what does it have to do with him? Should he willingly offer his neck to let others kill him without allowing any resistance?”

Guan Chile also nodded, “What the young lady said is right; the people from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard not only disobeyed orders and acted independently but also returned early, attempting to ambush the same path. Please uphold justice for the young master!”

“Please uphold justice for the young master!” Fang Ziqi had a slight smile at the corner of his mouth as he also raised his voice.

Xiang Chu smiled faintly and said, “If that’s the case, I, Xiang, naturally have an obligation to enforce justice and will certainly punish the people from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard severely to set an example!”

After a slight pause, Xiang Chu added, “However, this is merely your speculation. You came back with me; I did not see how the matter developed. You did not see it either. How about this: let the conflicting parties come forward and explain what exactly happened. How does that sound?”

“I have no objections!” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

“Good that this friend understands,” Xiang Chu nodded and turned to look. “Elder Fang, Elder Xu, bring over the surviving people!”

“Yes!” The two figures in the Divine Roaming Realm dashed forth. Not long after, they brought back all the surviving individuals.

Among them, many were severely injured and could not get up. Xie Rong and Li Fu were not so ragged, but both were still trembling.

They secretly glanced at Yang Kai but quickly returned their eyes in panic. The other young disciples, even more so, did not dare to look at Yang Kai at all. 

The battle just now had already terrified them deeply.

Even their elders were killed with a single move at Yang Kai's hands; how could these young people possess the ability to resist?

“Xie Rong, Li Fu,” Xiang Chu called out gently.

“Here… here… here,” Xie Rong stammered, struggling to respond, while Li Fu only managed a soft ‘uh-huh.’

Xiang Chu’s brow furrowed slightly, and then he suddenly adopted a friendly tone, “You both should have witnessed everything that happened earlier, right?”

“Yes… yes,” they both replied.

“Then speak the truth about the events, every detail, and if there is even a hint of falsehood or concealment, you know the consequences!” Xiang Chu said with a playful smile.

Xie Rong and Li Fu exchanged glances; neither dared to speak.

Hu Jiao’er coldly snorted, “They’re feeling guilty.”

Xiang Chu rubbed his forehead and sighed, “Jiao’er, before things are determined, let’s not say that.”

Hu Jiao’er retorted, “Young Master Xiang, I don't want to remind you again; please don’t call me that, alright?”

“Apologies, apologies, I misspoke.” Xiang Chu showed no embarrassment and bowed repeatedly. He then turned to Xie Rong and Li Fu, saying, “If you are unwilling to speak, I can only assume you were at fault first; I can kill you right now!”

Xie Rong and Li Fu couldn’t help but tremble and looked at Xiang Chu in horror.

Xiang Chu continued, “However, if you have any grievances, I can also uphold justice for you!”

Upon hearing this, the people from Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang couldn’t help but turn pale.

Xiang Chu’s words seemed harmless at first, but upon careful consideration, they were laden with profound meaning.

Indeed, Xie Rong and Li Fu exchanged a glance; their panic gradually stabilized, as if they had found a support.

Li Fu said, “Xie Rong, you speak.”

Xie Rong swallowed hard, gritted his teeth, and nodded, “Alright.”

Taking a deep breath and not daring to look at Yang Kai, he spoke in a low, sorrowful voice, “Today, our two factions fought on Taifang Mountain. After pursuing a group of martial artists from Cangyun Evil Land and killing them off, we found that we were not far from our camp, so we did not regroup with you, Young Master Xiang, and simply returned.”

“Bullshit!” Hu Jiao’er couldn’t help but scold angrily, “Since the battle began, I haven’t seen you. How could you have been chasing after the martial artists from Cangyun Evil Land? You clearly had premeditated plans to return!”

“We did not! Young Master Xiang, everything I said is the truth. If you don’t believe me, you can go to the western ridge to investigate. There should still be remains left there.”

Xiang Chu nodded slightly, “I will check. For now, I will assume you did indeed pursue the enemy. However, not returning to regroup on time is also an error on your part; I will take that into account and punish you accordingly. Do you have any objections?”

“None!” Xie Rong and Li Fu shook their heads in unison.

The Hu sisters were so infuriated that their chests heaved. Although Xiang Chu appeared to be handling the matter properly, his dismissive attitude clearly indicated he was favoring Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard.

“Continue!” Xiang Chu signaled.

“After we returned with our respective elders, we intended to wait for you to return before reporting. Unexpectedly, while resting, we suddenly felt an overwhelming killing intent surging forth.”

“Overwhelming killing intent?” Xiang Chu raised an eyebrow.

“Yes, we had never encountered such an evil aura before. The elders from both factions believed a powerful evil spirit was attacking, so they led us to confront it. However, as we followed the aura to the location, we were shocked to find that the evil spirit was actually… actually…”

“Actually what?” 

“Actually, it was that person.” 

“Which person?” Xiang Chu pressed for clarification.

“That person brought back by the Hu sisters a few days ago!” Xie Rong gritted his teeth and answered solemnly.

Xiang Chu glanced at Yang Kai, who smiled slightly in return.

The smile was calm, and his demeanor unruffled, making Xiang Chu taken aback.

“What happened next?” Xiang Chu asked, shifting his focus.

“Then… that person went berserk and attacked us. The elders from both factions were unable to hold him back, and countless disciples were slain and injured. In the end, even two of our elders sacrificed their lives to save us.” As Xie Rong spoke, heartbreak filled his words; he pounded his chest and lamented, “Please, Young Master, uphold justice for our factions and avenge our fallen brothers, sisters, and elders!”

Li Fu also timed her tears perfectly, wiping the corners of her eyes, choking as she said, “Please, Young Master, uphold justice. We will not rest until this grudge is settled!”

Hearing them, the people from Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower gnashed their teeth in resentment, their hearts seething with hatred.

Xiang Chu fell silent for a moment before speaking, “You may rise.”

“If the Young Master cannot uphold justice for us and slay that evil spirit, we shall kneel here forever!” Xie Rong and Li Fu knelt, bowing their heads to the ground.

Xiang Chu’s expression darkened, “Right now, things are still unclear; this is merely your side of the story. If you want to kneel, you can do so here.”

Raising his eyes, he smiled at Yang Kai, saying, “Friend, do you have anything to say? I am not someone who cannot distinguish black from white. If you have something to say, I am all ears.”

The Hu sisters immediately looked at Yang Kai nervously.

Yang Kai shrugged, speaking indifferently, “Nothing!”

“Yang Kai!” Hu Jiao’er exclaimed, her expression paled as she anxiously grasped his arm.

Xiang Chu was also somewhat surprised, looking at him in astonishment, seemingly not expecting that he would remain unrepentant.

Seeing his composed demeanor, Xiang Chu had a faintly ominous feeling.

He dared not to defend himself and showed no signs of anxiety; clearly, he was not afraid of any consequences. Was this person arrogant or confident?

“Yang Kai, say a few words! They are slandering you; how can you not speak?” Hu Mei’er urged, her urgency evident.

Yang Kai smiled lightly, “To add crimes; what need is there for excuses?”

The Hu sisters were momentarily stunned, suddenly recalling that even if Yang Kai defended himself, it would likely be in vain; his current state was enough for everyone here to classify him as a demon!

Now that everyone was at war with the Cangyun Evil Land, the emergence of demons meant what? Anyone could slay them. Thus, even if it were Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard who made the first move, Yang Kai wouldn’t gain any justification.

Defending himself would only be a waste of breath!

His expression gradually darkened as he coldly chuckled, “Whether I am human or demon does not require outsiders to judge.”

Xiang Chu could not help but narrow his eyes, staring intently at Yang Kai.

After a long pause, he finally spoke, “What this friend means is, I too lack the qualification to judge you?”

“How do you qualify?” Yang Kai looked at him indifferently.

“Presumptuous!” Elder Fang shouted angrily, “The Xiang Family is a first-class family, and the Young Master is the commander here. Who do you think you are to dare speak to the Young Master like that?”

“A first-class family, such might!” Yang Kai burst into laughter.

“Today, I will let you witness the might of a first-class family!” Xiang Chu was equally incensed by Yang Kai's provocation, letting out a cold snort and saying, “Elder Fang, Elder Xu, seize this demon!”

“Yes!” The two figures in the Divine Roaming Realm responded promptly.

“You dare!” The Hu sisters immediately stepped forward, their delicate forms shielding Yang Kai.

Xiang Chu’s face turned cold, and a flash of ruthless intent flickered in his eyes as he took a deep breath, “Ladies, if you do not wish to get hurt, step aside. If you insist on being obstinate, I can also label your families as collaborators with this demon and capture you both!”

“What a big hat to put on!” Guan Chile stepped forward, sneering, “Young Master, is this how your Xiang Family handles matters?”

Xiang Chu’s expression was grim, “This is my way of handling matters, Xiang Chu! If we do not eradicate demons, we cannot ensure peace of mind!”
