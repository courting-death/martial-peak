## Chapter 331 — Sincere Cooperation?

The group had been walking for quite a while.

Suddenly, Yang Kai's eyes sparkled like lightning as he fixed his gaze in a certain direction.

"Wait!" Yang Kai reached out and pulled Leng Shan back.

“Stop!” Shen Yi noticed the movement behind them and quickly raised his hand, causing a group of disciples from Ghost King Valley to halt abruptly, each one bracing for a potential threat.

“What happened?” Leng Shan asked, surprised.

Yang Kai did not respond; instead, he focused even more intently. After a moment, his expression turned cold, and like a flash of lightning, he shot forward, his True Essence surging as he reached out with a large hand towards the front.

In the air, ripples like waves seemed to emerge, and as this first layer of ripples spread, a figure suddenly appeared within everyone’s field of vision.

The person showed a hint of confusion and fear, seemingly unable to believe what he was seeing as he looked at Yang Kai. He quickly stepped back, raising his hands and repeatedly exclaiming, “Hey, hey, hey…”

Yang Kai’s expression froze for a moment, his gaze lingering on the pale, colorless hands of the man.

Each disciple from Ghost King Valley had hands of this color, devoid of the healthy hue of blood, appearing extremely terrifying.

“Ah… Brother Yang, stop!” Shen Yi hurriedly called out.

Upon hearing the shout, Yang Kai immediately halted his advance.

“It's us, it’s us,” Shen Yi and Leng Shan rushed over.

“I figured that out,” Yang Kai chuckled awkwardly. He had originally thought there was an ambush waiting, but it turned out this person was also a disciple of Ghost King Valley. Considering this, the voice he heard earlier must have been a signal from him.

After being forced to reveal himself, the person continued to stare incredulously at Yang Kai. When Shen Yi approached, he exclaimed, “What the heck, who is this guy?”

“Junior Sister's savior,” Shen Yi briefly introduced.

Yang Kai then realized that this disciple of Ghost King Valley was Cheng Ying, who had been scouting ahead.

“Sorry, it was a misunderstanding!” Yang Kai clasped his fists towards him.

“Man, you’re amazing!” Cheng Ying shouted, “I brought a concealed treasure, and used the Ghost Concealment martial skill, yet not a single person from Senior Brother Shen's group could spot me, but you saw right through it in an instant?”

Hearing this, everyone began to realize how unusual it was.

Had it not been for Cheng Ying’s perfect concealment, they wouldn’t have let him scout alone ahead. This kind of concealment technique combined with treasures and martial skills was something even an average Divine Roaming Realm expert would find difficult to detect. Relying on this, Cheng Ying was able to probe various pieces of information ahead without a hitch.

Who would have expected that Yang Kai, who had yet to reach Divine Roaming Realm, could see through it so clearly!

How could they not be surprised?

“Indeed, Brother Yang, how did you do that?” Shen Yi also looked at him with curiosity.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow slightly and replied calmly, “Perhaps my instincts are sharper than most.”

“Is that even possible?” Cheng Ying seemed somewhat incredulous, but since Yang Kai said so, he did not press further.

Leng Shan scrutinized Yang Kai with suspicion. There seemed to be something on her mind, but she did not pry but instead shifted the topic, saying, “Cheng Ying, you sent a signal; did you discover something?”

Cheng Ying then came back to his senses. Wiping his mouth, he excitedly said, “Yes! Those two chicks…”

“Hmm?” Leng Shan's expression suddenly turned cold. As a woman, she found the term ‘chicks’ somewhat off-putting.

“Ahem… the movements of those two women have been exposed.” Cheng Ying chuckled, flailing his hands in excitement as he recounted, “But they’re incredibly powerful. Although their realms don’t seem very high, their combined strength has seen a substantial increase, most likely due to cultivating some special cultivation method. The idiots from Xiaoyao Sect had no clue about how tough they were, resulting in several of them getting killed. That fool Yu Qing almost got castrated by one of the women—oh, that scene… just gruesome!”

Cheng Ying appeared quite animated. While he spoke, he gestured flamboyantly at his own lower body and shivered as if having a chill, “It made me feel a shiver down there—what a frightening experience!”

“Ahem… Junior Brother Cheng, stop being silly!” Shen Yi interrupted, seeing that Leng Shan's expression wasn’t too pleasant.

“Hey…” Cheng Ying scratched his head awkwardly, pretending to zip his mouth. “Right, I should watch my words. Don’t get mad, Junior Sister!”

Leng Shan huffed lightly, fully aware of his nature, understanding that a dog would not change its way of eating shit.

Shen Yi then shifted his expression, becoming exceedingly gleeful. “So did Yu Qing get... you know... castrated?”

Cheng Ying replied in disappointment, “No, what a pity! But after taking that hit, I reckon he won’t be able to perform for at least ten days to half a month… Hehe, heh, deserves it!”

The latter half of his sentence was directed at Leng Shan with a forced smile.

“Ah, what a shame!” Shen Yi lamented with a long sigh. “What happened next? What about those two women?”

“They ran away, deeper into their territory,” Cheng Ying’s tone suddenly turned serious. “There are Purple Evil Spirits rampaging there, and… there are quite a number of them. I predict they’re about to reach their limits.”

“I see…” Shen Yi frowned. “What does Yu Qing mean?”

“His intention is naturally to capture them alive. So, he wants us to cooperate with them, eliminate those Purple Evil Spirits first, and then capture those two women.”

“Damn!” Shen Yi cursed angrily.

Ghost King Valley had suffered losses at the hands of Xiaoyao Sect over the years. Still, due to a certain Huangquan Pool occupied by Xiaoyao Sect, which greatly benefited Ghost King Valley disciples in their cultivation, they were forced to yield and avoid direct confrontation.

For that Huangquan Pool, Ghost King Valley had no idea how many female disciples they had sent into Xiaoyao Sect over the years for those men to vent their frustrations.

The two sects had long been at odds, yet could not openly declare war, maintaining a fragile balance.

So, even if Leng Shan and the others were unwilling to involve themselves in this matter, they had to come and assist Xiaoyao Sect under orders from their master. After all, Yu Qing had promised that if they could capture those two women alive, they would have access to that Huangquan Pool for a month.

A month would suffice to greatly enhance the strength of over a hundred disciples from Ghost King Valley! Leng Shan and the others could not refuse such temptation.

Yu Qing wanted the people from Ghost King Valley to rush over, which was clearly to use them to eradicate the Purple Evil Spirits, thereby minimizing the casualties of his own side.

Disciples from both sects had long been familiar with each other’s tricks. Shen Yi and Leng Shan were well aware of his intentions.

“Are we going or not?” Cheng Ying asked, looking at Shen Yi and Leng Shan.

Shen Yi clenched his teeth and remained silent, merely gazing at Leng Shan.

Leng Shan coldly chuckled, “Let’s go, of course! Even if just to see their grim situation, we should go over!”

Shen Yi’s spirit was instantly invigorated, nodding, “Indeed, Junior Sister makes a valid point.”

Once the group came to a consensus, they set off under Cheng Ying’s lead.

The road was quiet, not a single Evil Spirit appeared, likely due to having been cleared earlier.

After traveling for quite a while, they encountered a group of people, with their numbers not at all inferior to Ghost King Valley’s group. Furthermore, judging by the traces nearby, a fierce battle had likely just occurred. There were faint traces of blood on the ground, along with several corpses lying about.

A sinister-looking man with pale skin sat with his legs apart, drenched in blood below. Sweat dripped from his forehead as an expression of deep resentment twisted his features. He gazed ominously into the depths of the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, muttering to himself, “Those two bitches, I’ll capture you sooner or later to settle the score for hurting me, for harming me here!”

In the dim light, it was apparent that there was a half-foot-long wound in the middle of his thigh, and blood was flowing steadily from it.

In front of this man knelt a stunningly beautiful woman, gently tending to his wounds.

Even in such circumstances, the sinister man's lower half remained defiantly upright.

As the disciples of Ghost King Valley approached, Leng Shan disdainfully turned her gaze away, while Shen Yi curiously leaned closer to observe, taunting, “That injury doesn’t look too serious—just a superficial wound. What are you whining about, Yu Qing?”

Yu Qing instantly erupted in anger, “If it weren’t for my good luck, this wouldn’t just be a superficial wound! Those two bitches must pay the price—I want them to wish they were dead!”

Yu Qing raged, appearing extremely furious.

Yang Kai’s gaze shifted toward the Xiaoyao Sect side. To his astonishment, he found that the men in this sect all had pale complexions, appearing somewhat frail with their blood a bit lacking. Each one was strikingly handsome, though their pale faces marred their charm.

Each male disciple from Xiaoyao Sect was accompanied by radiant and charming women, contrasting sharply with the men’s pale, bloodless appearance. The women were all rosy-cheeked and enchanting, seemingly flourishing very well.

When they looked towards the disciples of Ghost King Valley, they did not conceal the stirring desires in their eyes. One young woman was particularly bold, playfully teasing the male disciples of Ghost King Valley, her tongue whimsically flicking out, exuding an atmosphere of extreme licentiousness.

The Xiaoyao Sect male disciple not only did not show jealousy but actually gleefully pinched her curvy backside, provoking a flurry of gasps from her.

Yang Kai’s complexion darkened. He noticed that everyone he had encountered recently was adept in the ways of men and women. There was no need to mention Shan Qingluo and Bilo; the two cultivated alluring arts and were very familiar with intimate matters, despite being maidens.

The disciples of Xiaoyao Sect appeared to be engaged in similar activities regarding the yin and yang, but he wondered why they were all so feeble after taking in so much.

“There’s a reason you Ghost King Valley folks look ugly, but the people from Xiaoyao Sect look even more disgusting,” Yang Kai murmured softly to Leng Shan’s ear.

“Who looks ugly?” Leng Shan suddenly became furious.

“Oh, I was merely commenting on your hands; they’re as pale as a corpse.”

“You don’t understand. In a few years, when cultivation improves, our skin color will return. Don’t compare us from Ghost King Valley with the trash from Xiaoyao Sect, hmph!”

Yang Kai shrugged, choosing not to pursue the topic further.

“Enough chitchat. Since you’ve arrived, let’s get started. There are quite a number of Purple Evil Spirits ahead. It’s likely that we can’t pass through relying on just one sect’s strength; thus, we must work together sincerely,” Yu Qing said, fixing his pants and standing up to address Shen Yi.

Shen Yi sneered, “I hope you Xiaoyao Sect can truly cooperate sincerely!”
