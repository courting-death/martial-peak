## Chapter 1608 — You Actually Don't Run

After a moment, Xue Lian's roar abruptly died away, as if someone had clamped a hand over his throat.

At the same time his roar ceased, the dense yao qi of the entire demon mountain suddenly grew turbulent, as if answering a summons, rolling together toward the cave.

The cave gaped like a split beast's maw, accepting that enormous, terrifying yao qi; in less than ten breaths, the tens of thousands of years of lingering yao qi on the mountain had been drained away without a trace.

Yang Kai's brow furrowed.

Mi Tian and Lie Feng exchanged glances, neither seeming to understand what was happening.

Within the cave, a ferocious aura was slowly reviving, an intensity that made Yang Kai distinctly uneasy.

Rustle… rustle… rustle…

Footsteps came from inside the cave, and a moment later Xue Lian emerged from the entrance; he no longer looked distressed or enraged, but wore a strangely thoughtful expression, hands spread before him, staring intently.

A covert gleam of pleasure flickered in the depths of his eyes.

"Xue Lian, what the hell are you doing?" Mi Tian shouted angrily; they'd only just clashed with Yang Kai, and Xue Lian's inexplicable behavior left Mi Tian furious.

Yang Kai was too strong—none of the three could be fully certain of killing him here, so not a single person could afford to be careless.

"He seems different now," Lie Feng squinted toward the cave.

"First kill Yang Kai together, then deal with anything else!" Mi Tian snorted and again drove the strange flower forward to attack Yang Kai.

Although Lie Feng sensed something off about Xue Lian, he knew this was not the time for squabbling; his figure flickered and he silently closed on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had put most of his attention on Xue Lian.

This Xue Lian was completely different from before—Yang Kai actually felt immense pressure from his movements!

Xue Lian seemed to come to his senses as well. His blood-red eyes glanced toward a certain spot in the void, glimmering with a strange light. With an odd expression, he murmured, “The Shadow Eagle bloodline? Interesting… I didn’t expect to encounter a descendant of an old acquaintance so soon after seeing the light of day again.”

After speaking that strange line, he suddenly took a step forward.

Ignoring spatial barriers, he actually appeared more than ten zhang away; no one could see exactly how he moved, only Yang Kai, who had been watching him closely, detected a trace.

It was not that he ignored space, but that his speed was so great Yang Kai's Divine Sense could hardly keep up.

Xue Lian reached out, seeming to casually snatch at the void.

At his grasp the space froze.

A panicked figure emerged—Lie Feng, who had vanished.

Lie Feng's face was a mixture of shock and anger; he hadn't expected Xue Lian to ruin his plans and, hurriedly, tried to retreat and demand an explanation.

But Xue Lian didn't give him the chance; inexplicably, his blood-red, scale-covered hand clamped around Lie Feng's throat!

Yang Kai's expression changed in alarm, and Mi Tian was equally stunned.

He couldn't bother attacking Yang Kai now. Mi Tian glared at Xue Lian and barked, "What are you doing?"

The three of them had set a trap for Yang Kai; now the enemy was unharmed and Xue Lian had turned on his own—Mi Tian could not tolerate it!

Xue Lian ignored Mi Tian and hoisted Lie Feng aloft like a child, his scarlet eyes cold as he asked, in a flat tone, "What relation do you have with that old bastard Tian Jiu?"

Lie Feng finally realized the danger and desperately stirred his yao essence to free himself, but no matter how hard he tried his yao essence seemed bound, immobile within him.

"You're not Xue Lian!" Lie Feng cried out in horror.

Lie Feng knew Xue Lian could not have subdued him with a single move; combined with the earlier upheaval of the mountain's yao qi, he immediately understood what had occurred.

"Possession!" Yang Kai and Mi Tian reacted together, exclaiming in shock.

"Good eyes, little ones!" Xue Lian gave a sinister chuckle, not denying it; instead he looked at Yang Kai with meaning, a greedy light passing through his eyes.

Yang Kai felt a chill down his spine under that gaze, uncertain of its intent.

Xue Lian paid him no more heed and returned his attention, asking, "What relation do you have with Tian Jiu?"

"He's my family ancestor!" Lie Feng answered through clenched teeth, face flushed.

"He's still alive?" Xue Lian cocked his head.

"Our ancestor fell long ago. Who are you, senior?" Lie Feng demanded in a low voice.

When Tian Jiu was alive he was a top expert of Di Chen Star, a supremely powerful yao king with the peak strength of a Third Stage Void King; he fell ten thousand years ago, and Lie Feng's branch of the bloodline had produced no one stronger than him since.

"He's dead? That's a pity—there are still old scores I wanted to settle with him," Xue Lian sneered, disappointment and a feral grin mingling. "But it doesn't matter; meeting his descendant today will at least settle an old grievance for me."

"Who exactly are you?" Lie Feng asked tremblingly; Xue Lian's grip tightened until he could hardly breathe.

"I lived in the same era as Tian Jiu and we had many grudges—what do you think my name is?" Xue Lian laughed low and sinisterly.

Lie Feng's face drained of color as he stammered, "You are Yao King Feng E—you actually perished here!"

Lie Feng knew his family's history well. Tens of thousands of years ago, when Tian Jiu reigned, the Shadow Eagle line was dominant on Di Chen Star, but there existed another powerful yao king who could rival Tian Jiu.

That was Yao King Feng E!

Hearing Xue Lian's words, Lie Feng immediately realized the newcomer's identity.

The one who had taken over Xue Lian's body was none other than that merciless, bloodthirsty Yao King Feng E!

Rumor had it his strength shook heaven and earth, and his deeds were savage and bloody; countless yao and humans had died at his hands, turning Di Chen Star into chaos, hence the name Yao King Feng E.

Tian Jiu had tried many times to slay him but had never succeeded, and their hatred had only deepened.

Later he suddenly vanished from Di Chen Star; no one knew where he had gone.

Chi Yue and the others knew he had perished in the Blood Prison, but the younger generation were ignorant of those ancient events.

Now learning this truth, Lie Feng felt his world collapse.

Falling into the hands of such a yao expert left no hope.

"True, I perished here, but today I rise again!" Xue Lian said with a cold laugh. He tightened his grip on Lie Feng's throat; with a snapping sound Lie Feng's head lolled to the side and the light left his eyes.

Lie Feng was dead!

Xue Lian was now terrifyingly powerful beyond reason!

Mi Tian swallowed; his face was ashen.

Even when facing Yang Kai he had never felt so powerless. Yao King Feng E's fearsome reputation quenched any thought of resistance.

The moment Lie Feng died, Mi Tian hesitated no longer and immediately withdrew, trying to escape from that place of death.

"I haven't given permission—do you think you can leave?" Xue Lian turned toward Mi Tian and idly extended a hand, releasing a wondrous force.

The space before Mi Tian became an iron wall; he slammed against it and was halted.

Yang Kai's eyes widened as he watched, a hint of understanding dawning.

It was the power of a Domain! Although Xue Lian's present aura was still at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, Yao King Feng E who had possessed his body was truly a Third Stage Void King—so it made sense he could employ Domain power.

So this power could be used that way! Yang Kai's eyes gleamed; he was intrigued by Xue Lian's methods.

Mi Tian couldn't flee and changed direction, but Xue Lian snorted and waved a hand; a blood jiao shot out like a whip and became rope-like bindings that laced toward Mi Tian.

Mi Tian turned in fury and the strange flowers burst into a thousand petals, showering the sky as they rained down on Xue Lian.

At the same time his eyes flared with an odd radiance as he stared directly at Xue Lian.

Xue Lian was unconcerned and sneered contemptuously: "Soul-Seizing Evil Eye! You dare use that on me? Boy, you're overestimating yourself!"

As he spoke, his crimson eyes slowly turned deep and dark, like bottomless pits, pulling in and devouring the power of Mi Tian’s Evil Eye.

A terrifying surge of divine soul power erupted.

Mi Tian screamed as if struck by unbearable pain, his aura instantly wilting.

Not only had his evil eye failed, it had been turned against him and his spirit was grievously harmed.

The blood-red ropes instantly bound Mi Tian tight, preventing any escape.

Xue Lian sneered, raised his hand, and slowly closed his fist.

The ropes binding Mi Tian tightened with his fist.

"No!" Mi Tian cried, but it was useless; the ropes cut into his flesh and snapped his bones.

With a series of crisp cracks, Mi Tian was torn apart—flesh and blood strewn, no intact bones remained.

With a few motions he had slain two rising yao talents; Xue Lian looked down at his hand with satisfaction. "Not bad, not bad—the ancient inheritance of the Blood Jiao line truly has its uniqueness."

He seemed pleased with this new body.

But soon he shook his head, lifted his gaze, and fixed Yang Kai with an even hotter stare, greed flooding his eyes—Yang Kai's presence seemed to interest him far more!

"You actually don't run?" Xue Lian asked in surprise; although he had watched Yang Kai's movements while killing Mi Tian and Lie Feng, he had never given him a chance to flee.

Yet the human merely stood there watching coldly, showing no intent to flee, which astonished Xue Lian.
