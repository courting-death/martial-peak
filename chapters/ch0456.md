## Chapter 456 — Visitors from the Yang Family

The people who had rushed over quickly scattered. After a while, they all returned and gathered to report the situation to Qiu Yimeng.

“No casualties.” Qiu Yimeng’s expression was somewhat grim. Although the news that there were no losses was comforting, how that person had managed to get in was worrying.

The possibility of a traitor could not be ruled out, but it was very low. At least judging by Yang Kai’s expression, he did not suspect any inside accomplices.

This meant the intruder had relied solely on their own skills to sneak near the alchemy room. Thinking of this, Qiu Yimeng’s face shifted slightly.

The Yang Kai manor now gathered many strong cultivators, including experts at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, and the alchemy room's defenses were top priority. Yet even so, that expert almost succeeded—how powerful was that person?

But if they had already succeeded in sneaking in, why had they left traces to be discovered? Qiu Yimeng found this puzzling.

“Ying Jiu, did you get a clear look at the intruder?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow and asked.

From the darkness came Ying Jiu’s voice: “No. I don't even know if they were male or female, nor their cultivation level.”

Everyone was shocked. When it came to stealth and assassination, Ying Jiu was an absolute master; even after exchanging a move with the opponent, he had not gleaned any information. This person was truly mysterious.

“However, judging from my perspective, this person’s true cultivation isn’t very high. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been unable to withstand my Seal Shadow Dance Kill.” Ying Jiu said in a low voice.

Although the intruder managed to escape, they were wounded, as evidenced by the bloodstains on the ground.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and pondered for a moment before saying, “Then either they relied on the power of a treasure, or their cultivation method is unique. Interesting. Who managed to recruit such a master?”

Had it not been for him and Shopkeeper Meng being alert simultaneously, that person might really have succeeded.

This person’s intent in sneaking near the alchemy room was obvious—they definitely aimed to harm the alchemists of Yao Wang Valley. If something had happened to the alchemists of Yao Wang Valley in Yang Kai’s manor, that would be a huge problem.

“Junior Brother Yang, I have no other matters. I will return to alchemy.” Qin Ze’s face was calm; there was no joy about surviving the ordeal, nor fear of nearly being pushed to the brink.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded.

Once Qin Ze left, Yang Kai coldly called out, “Xiao Shun!”

“I am here!” A short man, standing a full head shorter than others, stepped forward from the crowd. He was an Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm cultivator.

Xiao Shun was one of the Yang Family Blood Servants, and since Eighth Brother Yang Quan was eliminated, he had voluntarily pledged allegiance to Yang Kai. Despite being gravely wounded, under Yang Kai’s care he recovered within a day or two.

“You will be stationed permanently at the alchemy room!”

Xiao Shun sneered, “Young master, rest assured. As long as I, Xiao Shun, live, no one will set foot near the alchemy room!”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, his eyes deep as he gazed toward the direction where the mysterious intruder had fled, letting out a cold laugh.

It seemed the people from Yao Wang Valley still made several of his elder brothers uneasy; otherwise, they would not dare send someone to deal with them. Yet whose subordinate this intruder was, they were shockingly bold.

A rosy glow tinted the east; dawn was approaching.

After such an incident, no one could feel at ease. Qiu Yimeng immediately redeployed the manor’s defenses, busily attending to preparations.

Yang Kai stood in place, looking at the bloodstains on the ground. Reflecting on the scene glimpsed through his Divine Sense, he slowly shook his head—he could neither discern the intruder’s cultivation nor their gender.

The cultivation method or treasure that this mysterious master relied upon was truly extraordinary.

Suddenly, hurried footsteps sounded outside. Yang Kai turned to see a martial artist from the Qiu Family’s Autumn Rain Hall rushing over. Upon reaching Yang Kai, he cupped his fists and said, “Young Master Kai, visitors from the Yang Family!”

“Visitors from the Yang Family?” Yang Kai’s expression tightened.

“They have already arrived at the main hall, holding a Yang Family Elder’s order, requesting your presence for a meeting!”

“I understand.”

After dismissing the messenger and frowning thoughtfully for a moment, Yang Kai suddenly said loudly, “Everyone, prepare yourselves. Something’s about to happen today.”

“Hahaha, finally some action!”

“Yeah, after so many days—only training, just training—I was about to burst.”

“Yang Kai, whatever you’re going to do this time, you better take us with you.”

A group of young men and women rubbed their hands together enthusiastically, spilling an air of restless anticipation.

“We’ll see. I don’t know the details yet, so get ready for now.” Yang Kai smiled slightly, then turned toward the main hall.

Qiu Yimeng hurried along beside him, suspiciously asking, “How do you know something will happen?”

Yang Kai chuckled softly, “If I’m right, the family wants to accelerate the succession war. Ever since our Eighth Brother went down, the six of us have been holding back and focusing on our cultivation. It’s been nearly a month like this, and such calm isn’t good.”

“Would the Yang Family order you to proactively strike?”

“It won’t be something that crude. There must be another method.” Yang Kai frowned. He was only speculating; he didn’t know the family’s exact plan. He would have to wait for the visitors’ arrival to find out.

By the time they spoke, they were already at the main hall.

Inside, a man stood with his hands behind his back, waiting.

Yang Kai glanced and was stunned. He hurried forward, “Father?”

Fourth Master Yang turned to see his son approaching and smiled slightly, nodding gently.

Qiu Yimeng also behaved with great propriety, curtseying softly as she said, “Qiu Yimeng of the Qiu Family greets Fourth Master Yang.”

Yang Yingfeng looked at Qiu Yimeng with significance and smiled, “Miss Qiu, no need for formalities. Since you support Kai, you are family.”

He paused, then added, “You have suffered for Kai’s sake.”

“Uncle, you are too polite. It is my own choice to help Yang Kai; it is no hardship.”

Yang Yingfeng was delighted and said cheerfully, “Kai is still young. Should he offend you, you must forgive him. If you suffer any grievances here, speak freely. I will settle them!”

“Thank you, Uncle!” Qiu Yimeng smiled sweetly. “From now on, please support your niece.” She cast a warning glance at Yang Kai, as if saying, If you dare bully me again, I’ll report you.

Hearing the older and younger subtly alter how they addressed one another, Yang Kai’s face darkened. He hastily changed the topic: “Father, why have you come?”

“Carrying the family’s orders.” Yang Yingfeng’s expression turned serious as he raised the Yang Family Elder’s order and said gravely, “In two hours, at the eastern side of War City, fifty li away near Po Jing Lake, a batch of treasures will appear! Those interested in seizing them should hurry there!”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, deeply tempted. Qiu Yimeng’s gaze also gleamed.

A cultivator’s strength is rooted in cultivation, but beyond that, external forces can be leveraged.

There are three external aids: pills, treasures, and secret arts that enhance combat power.

With pills, Yang Kai had no worries; with Xia Ningshang and the alchemists from Yao Wang Valley, he had a considerable advantage.

Secret arts were rare and unpredictable, so what he cared about most now was treasures!

A cultivator with high-grade treasures could greatly boost their combat strength.

Compared to pills and secret arts, treasures offered more immediate, effective, and straightforward enhancement.

This was a weakness in Yang Kai’s manor. The treasures wielded by the various powerful cultivators here were ones they brought themselves, each with at most one or two. If more treasures could be obtained, the manor’s strength would rise a whole level.

Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng exchanged a glance and saw the excitement in each other’s eyes.

“I have delivered the order. Whether to go or not is your own choice, young ones.” Yang Yingfeng smiled faintly.

“Why wouldn’t we go?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “These treasures are contributed by the family, right?”

“Not just the Yang Family. All eight great families of Zhongdu are involved, but our Yang Family provides the majority. The other seven only contribute symbolically.”

“How many treasures?”

“One thousand!” Yang Yingfeng held up one finger.

Even Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng, both experienced and high-ranking, couldn’t help but breathe a little faster.

One thousand treasures—among the cultivators gathered in the manor, there were only three or so people capable of taking them all. If possible, each would have three or four treasures, though that was unrealistic.

“Eighty percent are Earth-Grade treasures, most of the remaining twenty percent are Heaven-Grade... among them, there are even a few Mystery-Grade treasures!”

“Even more reason to go!” Yang Kai grinned.

Mystery-Grade treasures could have tremendous effects. If they didn’t fight for them, they would only benefit others.

But a thousand treasures released at once—the strength of the Zhongdu Eight Great Families was indeed extraordinary. Though most treasures were not top-tier, the quantity alone was staggering.

“Uncle, is there any other usable information?” Qiu Yimeng asked sweetly, clearly hoping to uncover more to gain an advantage.

For example, how these treasures would appear and their exact location—this kind of intel would be invaluable.

“No need to ask. Since the family trusted my father to deliver the order, they only told him what they could disclose.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

Yang Yingfeng glanced at his son and nodded subtly. “Correct. All the information I know is harmless. Others are the same. You young ones start on equal footing; how much you gain depends on your own methods.”

“I was just asking casually!” Qiu Yimeng didn’t mind, acting especially sweet and clever in front of Yang Yingfeng, for reasons unknown.

“In that case, get ready well.” Yang Kai’s face was bright with spirit, his eyes burning with a fierce flame as he chuckled.

“If you have no other matters, father, please stay here a few more days.” Yang Kai suddenly looked at Yang Yingfeng.

Fourth Master Yang shook his head, “Your mother is worried about you. I must hurry back and report on your situation.”

“Do as you wish.”

“Go then!” Yang Yingfeng waved his hand.
