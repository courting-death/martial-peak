## Chapter 239 — The Rapid Change of the Situation

Yang Kai crouched down, leisurely gazing at her, and spoke, “Have you really become obedient?”

Zi Mo quickly nodded. The torment from the Control Soul Insect within her soul made her feel as if life was worse than death, and she could not resist it. Such suffering was unbearable for anyone; it was not that her spirit was weak, but rather that Yang Kai's heart was too ruthless.

“Will you not defy me in the future?” Yang Kai reached out a hand to lift her delicate chin, his gaze sweeping across her cheeks.

Zi Mo forced out a smile, which looked even worse than crying. “I won’t defy you!”

Yang Kai chuckled, extending a finger to tease Zi Mo's crimson lips, then probing inside, stirring her delicate tongue.

Zi Mo's eyes widened, not daring to show the slightest dissatisfaction. Her gaze was filled with submission and obedience, her agile tongue coiling around Yang Kai's finger, sucking it incessantly.

Her skills were quite impressive; otherwise, she wouldn't have been able to provoke Leng Shan, who often could not maintain her composure despite being a woman. The tongue wrapped around the finger, sometimes tight, sometimes loose. In no time, her eyes were filled with spring feelings, and suppressed gasps and enticing moans rang out at the right moments.

Leng Shan quickly turned her head, scolding softly, “Shameless!”

Yang Kai glanced at her, sneering, then withdrew his finger from Zi Mo's mouth, wiping it on her clothes. He pinched her cheek hard, causing Zi Mo to let out a cry, her watery eyes looking at Yang Kai with grievance.

“Although I know you are acting, that expression is really good!” Yang Kai smacked his lips.

Zi Mo smiled seductively, “The women of Tianlang Kingdom admire the strong. You are so powerful; I like you too much to act!”

“I’m only at the seventh stage of the Separation and Union Realm. Is that considered powerful?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

Zi Mo's smile immediately faded, but soon she laughed again, “Realm doesn’t represent everything. Besides, you are still so young. Given enough time, you will be stronger than anyone!”

“Flattery is well done! I like it!” Yang Kai laughed heartily and straightened up. “Get up!”

“Yes!” Zi Mo obediently stood up, quietly adjusting her clothes.

In front of Leng Shan and Jin Hao, she was the master, but in front of Yang Kai, she had become an obedient servant, not daring to act recklessly.

Zi Mo did not wish for the torment she had just endured to descend upon her again.

Yang Kai coldly looked at Leng Shan, chuckling. Leng Shan's expression was quite unnatural, filled with embarrassment and indignation, but more so with humiliation and unwillingness.

Not to mention her previous grievances with Yang Kai, just the fact that she had betrayed him earlier was enough to lead her to a fate worse than death.

Just moments ago, she had betrayed someone, and now that person had control over her life and death.

As the saying goes, thirty years in the east and thirty years in the west, but these thirty years… were but a fleeting moment.

Zi Mo glanced at Yang Kai, then at Leng Shan, and softly said, “Do you want her dead? I can easily put her to death!”

She was a clever woman and naturally sensed the killing intent in Yang Kai's eyes.

Leng Shan's complexion changed drastically, hurriedly retreating a few steps, watching Yang Kai and Zi Mo with extreme vigilance, her face filled with determination.

One could imagine that if Yang Kai truly wanted her dead, Leng Shan would definitely fight back desperately.

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai slowly shook his head. Leng Shan couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, staring at Yang Kai and asking, “Why?”

“Why what?” Yang Kai replied, somewhat impatiently.

“Why will you let me go?” Leng Shan questioned her doubts. “Our elders have unresolved grievances, and we have enmities between us. I don’t believe you would be so kind as to spare my life. It would be easy for you to take my life now!”

“Actually, I’m a good person. Is that reason not enough?” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Zi Mo scoffed from the side, and Leng Shan also sneered, saying, “If you were really a good person, you would let her remove the insect from my body! Now, although you don’t kill me, you still control my life and death. What kind of good person does that make you?”

“Do you have the qualifications to question me?” Yang Kai sneered, “You from Ghost King Valley are also not good people, right?”

Leng Shan replied, “I never said I was!”

“Sharp-tongued!” Yang Kai coughed lightly. He looked at Zi Mo and said, “Remove the insect from her, so she knows what a true good person is.”

Zi Mo trembled, looking at Yang Kai in disbelief. She never expected this young man to make such a decision.

Is he a fool? Without the Control Soul Insect, how could he control this woman?

Even Leng Shan was stunned upon hearing this, her eyes suddenly sparkling with joy.

“My orders will not be repeated a second time!” Yang Kai coldly looked at Zi Mo. The latter forced a smile and walked in front of Leng Shan, feeling a sense of loss.

She and Leng Shan were indeed different; although they had grievances with this young man, they were still martial artists of the Great Han, and at this moment, they should indeed work together.

“You're lucky!” Zi Mo said softly, a hint of envy in her voice. She then reached out a hand, placing it on Leng Shan's abdomen, conveying her thoughts while circulating her Yuan Qi.

Moments later, Leng Shan's complexion turned pale, and she retched, a worm being expelled from her mouth.

Zi Mo quickly collected the worm, and Leng Shan could no longer endure it, rushing aside to vomit continuously.

After a long while, she wiped her mouth and slowly walked back, her expression complex as she looked at Yang Kai.

To have regained her freedom so inexplicably was truly surprising and delightful.

“You killed Jin Hao, right?” After a moment of silence, Leng Shan asked.

“Indeed!” Yang Kai nodded. “Do you want revenge? I can give you the opportunity.”

“I won’t help him take revenge!” Leng Shan slowly shook her head, but then her expression suddenly turned cold as she reached out a palm towards Yang Kai, sneering, “But I also don’t believe you will truly spare me!”

A wailing sound erupted, and a human face appeared from her palm, directly plunging into Yang Kai's body.

It was the secret technique of Ghost King Valley, the Ghost King Seal!

Zi Mo's expression changed drastically, and she was about to act, but Yang Kai stopped her with a hand.

“You…” Leng Shan hurriedly retreated, looking at Yang Kai in shock. Anyone who was struck by the Ghost King Seal would lose the ability to control their body; that vengeful spirit could destroy a person's mind and then occupy their body.

Leng Shan understood clearly that now, in this perilous place, even though she had regained her freedom, there was little hope for survival. If she encountered other martial artists from Tianlang Kingdom, she would still be killed or enslaved.

It was better to directly destroy Yang Kai's mind and control his body.

Controlling Yang Kai meant controlling Zi Mo, which would give Leng Shan enough leverage.

However, the Ghost King Seal was cast but had no effect, leaving her utterly stunned.

“Indeed, you are not a good person!” Yang Kai slowly shook his head. He had long seen through Leng Shan's unwillingness and ambition. All her previous actions were merely to lure her into using the Ghost King Seal.

“What happened to my Ghost King Seal?” Leng Shan questioned.

“Want it? Here you go!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, and the human face fled from Yang Kai's body, returning to Leng Shan's body.

Leng Shan no longer dared to linger. She turned and ran.

Zi Mo watched quietly from the side, unable to hold back any longer. She spoke, “You just let her go? She just tried to attack you.”

“Those who attack me must pay a price!” Yang Kai grinned, and as soon as he finished speaking, Leng Shan suddenly fell to the ground, letting out cries of agony.

Hearing that familiar sound, Zi Mo couldn't help but tremble.

Just moments ago, she had endured such torment, feeling as if life was worse than death, wishing to die immediately, yet she could not fulfill that wish. Now, she was merely a spectator.

How did he do it? Zi Mo was utterly baffled.

The torment Leng Shan endured was even more tragic than what Zi Mo had experienced. It took a full incense stick's time before the wailing stopped, but Leng Shan had completely fainted.

Yang Kai coldly said, “Bring her back!”

“Oh!” Zi Mo obediently stepped forward, carrying the unconscious Leng Shan back. Looking at Leng Shan, who was drenched, Zi Mo couldn't help but feel a sense of shared suffering.

“I need to recover; do not disturb me.” Yang Kai walked aside, sitting cross-legged to regain his strength.

Half a day later, Leng Shan slowly regained consciousness. Just as she woke up, another round of screams erupted, and she fainted again.

Zi Mo was alarmed, becoming increasingly cautious in her interactions with Yang Kai. She realized that this young man was ruthless, showing no compassion whatsoever. Both she and Leng Shan were top beauties, yet he tortured them without a shred of hesitation or pity.

Such a person was terrifying.

A complete cold-blooded pervert!

A day later, Leng Shan woke up again, and this time Yang Kai did not torture her.

Her strength was only at the True Yuan Realm, and she had not cultivated Divine Sense. If he continued to torment her, she might truly become an idiot.

Looking at Yang Kai, who was sitting cross-legged in the distance, with lingering fear, Leng Shan felt a deep sense of terror.

After much persuasion from Zi Mo, she finally trembled and took a step forward, inching closer to Yang Kai, biting her lip, her face pale, not daring to breathe a word.

Although she had previously been controlled by Zi Mo, that was merely having an extra insect within her body. But now? Her soul was controlled, and this disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion could deal with her as if it were child’s play.

Having just escaped from the wolf's den, she had fallen into the tiger's lair! Leng Shan couldn't help but feel a sense of desolation.

“Hmm…” Yang Kai had long sensed the two women approaching, yet he continued to sit with his eyes closed, pretending not to notice, wanting to see if they still harbored any ill intentions.

The test results were good; both Zi Mo and Leng Shan were now exceedingly obedient, not daring to entertain any thoughts of rebellion.

Opening his eyes to look at Leng Shan, the latter instinctively wanted to retreat but was caught by Zi Mo.

“Apologize!” Zi Mo, unsure of her own feelings, gently pushed Leng Shan, trying to comfort her.

A flash of humiliation crossed Leng Shan's eyes, her thin lips biting through the skin as she timidly raised her head to look at Yang Kai, quickly averting her gaze.

“If you keep this up, I won’t care about you anymore!” Zi Mo, feeling frustrated, thought that she was just a woman; why cling to that worthless pride? Men would say that a real man could bend and stretch.

Leng Shan's expression was unwilling, remaining silent.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, staring intently at her.

“I was wrong…” After a long while, Leng Shan finally spoke, her voice barely audible, her hands twisting together, anxious and uneasy.

Yang Kai merely looked at her indifferently, saying nothing.

Leng Shan gritted her teeth, suffering greatly, while Zi Mo chuckled lightly, saying, “She knows she was wrong and won’t dare to harm you again. Alright, alright, stop crying.”

As she spoke, she helped wipe the corners of Leng Shan's eyes.
