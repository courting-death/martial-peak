## Chapter 2478 — How Could He Die So Easily

"You really laid out quite the grand game!" Yang Kai exclaimed in mild shock. He hadn't expected that Wu Mengchuan would actually pass the Heaven Devouring Battle Art on to so many people—yet all those who tried to cultivate it had ended up devoured by its backlash.

After all, not everyone had a body like the Incarnation.

He secretly felt fortunate. Luckily, he had resisted the temptation back then and hadn't cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, or else he probably wouldn't even know how he died.

Although he considered his willpower to be strong, the Heaven Devouring Battle Art was simply too strange. Wu Mengchuan being able to cultivate to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was definitely not just a matter of willpower. Perhaps the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had left behind some cultivation experience for him to reference.

"If I can restore the glory of my ancestor, what does waiting a few hundred years matter?" Wu Mengchuan's body trembled as he shouted loudly.

Yang Kai's face darkened. "I want to ask, what's the difference between the main and the copy?"

"Heh heh, basically there's not much difference, but of course there are some distinctions. Those who cultivate the copy are just seeds. Once they reach the peak of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the seed matures and can be devoured by the one who cultivated the main art. That way, they can advance to Emperor! Also, if the seed matures, the one who cultivated the main art can sense them from a great distance." Wu Mengchuan's tone grew more and more excited.

Yang Kai suddenly understood. "No wonder you could find me in the Shattered Star Sea. So you could sense me."

Earlier, in the Origin Sea, he had also released the Incarnation. It was probably at that time that Wu Mengchuan sensed it.

Wu Mengchuan raised his arms and shouted, "For today, this Lord has waited hundreds of years. Finally, the clouds have parted and I see the moon!"

Yang Kai nodded. He had asked all he needed to ask. He had learned all he needed to know.

The reason the Incarnation had reached a bottleneck and couldn't break through was really a problem with the technique. But it wasn't that the technique was incomplete—it was just designed that way.

He pondered for a moment and said, "If someone who cultivated the copy devoured the one who cultivated the main art, what would happen?"

Wu Mengchuan was stunned for a moment, but quickly understood what Yang Kai meant. He grinned, "Young man, you have quite the ambition. Very good! With your aptitude, if you hadn't cultivated this divine art, you would surely achieve great things in the future. Unfortunately... now you're just a stepping stone for this Lord's advancement."

"You still haven't answered my question!" Yang Kai stared at him with a cold face.

Wu Mengchuan snorted, "If you could really devour this Lord, then of course you'd be the one to advance. What's there to ask?"

"I see..." Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction. "That's for the best."

"Boy, anything else you want to ask?" Wu Mengchuan barked. "Ask it all now and get ready for the journey. This Lord can't wait any longer."

"Nothing more!" Yang Kai grinned at him.

That strange smile made Wu Mengchuan pause, gritting his teeth. "Putting on airs!"

As he spoke, his Origin Qi suddenly surged, as if he was about to attack Yang Kai.

"Wait!" Yang Kai suddenly raised his hand.

"What else!" Wu Mengchuan snapped impatiently.

Yang Kai looked at him with a strange smile and said, "Aren't you curious why you can't sense that matured seed anymore?"

Wu Mengchuan was stunned, thinking, that's right. He had been wondering why he couldn't sense the matured seed's fluctuations, but Yang Kai kept asking questions and he forgot. Now, reminded by Yang Kai, he suddenly remembered.

He quickly asked, "Why!"

"Heh heh..." Yang Kai grinned and spread his hands. "Because, I never cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art in the first place!"

"What?" Wu Mengchuan was shocked. "You didn't cultivate it? Impossible!"

If Yang Kai hadn't cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, how could he have advanced to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm in such a short time? And judging by Yang Kai's demeanor and aura, it seemed he had been at this level for a while. His cultivation was extremely solid.

If Yang Kai hadn't cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, then how could the fluctuations of the seed he sensed earlier be explained?

He had clearly rushed over after sensing those fluctuations, and then saw Yang Kai.

Yang Kai said in a deep voice, "The one who cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art is someone else!"

"Who!" Wu Mengchuan's eyes narrowed.

Yang Kai waved his hand, and a gigantic figure descended from the sky. That massive form blocked out the light, casting a shadow over the ground. When it landed, the earth trembled.

Wu Mengchuan's mouth fell open as he looked up at the mountain-like being, feeling a suffocating pressure that made it hard to breathe.

And as this mountain-like being appeared, the vanished sensation returned once more.

This time, Wu Mengchuan could clearly sense that the fluctuation wasn't coming from Yang Kai, but from this monster.

Looking more closely, Wu Mengchuan couldn't help but gasp.

This gigantic monster actually had hands and feet, its whole body covered in thick rock armor. It looked just like a giant stone man, but this stone man had a pair of lively eyes that spun around constantly. In its hand, it held a pitch-black warhammer wrapped in darkness, exuding an extremely unpleasant aura.

Demonic weapon! Wu Mengchuan's eyes widened as he stared at the warhammer, utterly shocked and unable to believe his eyes. This was a genuine demonic weapon.

There are still demonic weapons in this world? Weren't these supposed to have disappeared long ago? Could it be that the Ancient Great Demons haven't gone extinct?

"Did you hear what this guy just said?" Yang Kai asked, pointing at Wu Mengchuan.

The Incarnation waved the Demonic Warhammer in its hand and rumbled, "I heard it very clearly."

"Devour him, and you'll be able to break through your bottleneck," Yang Kai said with a gentle smile.

The Incarnation also laughed heartily. "I've been waiting for this!"

As he spoke, he stepped forward.

Rumble...

A tremendous sound rang out as the solid ground was stamped with a huge footprint by the Incarnation.

"What the hell is that!" Wu Mengchuan finally snapped out of it and couldn't help but shout, "Where did you get this thing?"

Such a huge monster couldn't possibly have come from a Spatial Ring. He only saw Yang Kai wave his hand, and this thing appeared.

Moreover, Wu Mengchuan couldn't even tell if this thing was alive or not. It could talk and communicate, but had no sign of life.

Having lived for so many years, Wu Mengchuan never imagined he’d still be able to witness something so eye-opening today.

"Where I got it is none of your business. Just accept your death. If you don't resist, I'll make it quick. If you do... hmph!" Yang Kai sneered coldly from the side.

"You want this Lord to die?" Wu Mengchuan's eyes turned fierce as he roared, "Boy, you still don't understand the situation. In front of this Lord, who dares act so arrogantly?" As he spoke, he suddenly spread his hand toward the Incarnation and shouted, "Heaven Devouring Battle Art, devour for me!"

A mysterious power instantly spread out, as if it would devour everything, enveloping the Incarnation.

The Incarnation's massive body actually staggered and fell to its knees, a look of pain on its face as it howled in agony.

Yang Kai's expression changed drastically as he cried out, "What's going on?"

No one knew the Incarnation's strength better than Yang Kai. The Stone Puppet race was born with powerful bodies, and over the years, the Incarnation had refined countless treasures. Wielding the Demonic Warhammer, he could even fight an Emperor Realm expert. If not for his huge size making movement difficult, Yang Kai wouldn't have kept him hidden so often.

But now, such a powerful Incarnation was knocked to the ground by Wu Mengchuan in a single move, with no ability to fight back. How could Yang Kai not be shocked?

Is this old thing really that strong? Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

"Ahh, I'm dying..." the Incarnation wailed in agony, crying out as if in unbearable pain. "My strength is being devoured..."

"Hahahaha!" Wu Mengchuan laughed maniacally, his eyes wild as he shouted, "You dare act arrogant in front of this Lord? Watch as I devour you completely!"

Visibly, streams of pure energy flowed from the Incarnation and were absorbed by Wu Mengchuan, whose face became flushed as if he had been greatly nourished.

"Technique suppression!" Yang Kai's face darkened as he suddenly understood. He didn't dare let the Incarnation stay outside any longer and quickly put him back into the Small Xuan Realm with a wave of his hand.

Wu Mengchuan was devouring with great delight, but suddenly the source of power disappeared. Looking again, the Incarnation was gone without a trace.

His face immediately turned gloomy as he gritted his teeth. "Where is it? Bring it out now, or this Lord will make you wish for death!"

Yang Kai looked at him coldly and snorted, "Old dog, you planned well. There's a natural suppression between the main and copy techniques, isn't there?"

Wu Mengchuan said with a sullen face, "So what if there is?"

Yang Kai clicked his tongue. "If that's the case, then no matter how strong someone who cultivated the copy is, in front of you they're just food."

Wu Mengchuan snapped impatiently, "Enough nonsense, boy! Hurry up and bring that thing out. Once this Lord ascends to the Emperor Realm, perhaps I might even grant you a favor or two." The opportunity to break through was right before his eyes, yet Yang Kai had hidden it away—how could Wu Mengchuan not be anxious?

He didn't even know how Yang Kai summoned or put away that thing. If he didn't need to figure that out, he would have attacked Yang Kai immediately instead of negotiating.

Yang Kai snorted, "The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor was a ruthless expert in his day, slaughtering living beings, devouring stars, and shattering star domains, inciting the wrath of heaven and man. In the end, he was killed by the other Emperors. Wu Mengchuan, even if you advance to the Emperor Realm, so what? You'll just follow in your ancestor's footsteps."

"Utter nonsense!" Wu Mengchuan's eyes burned red with fury as he shouted, "Those so-called Emperors were nothing but narrow-minded schemers, jealous of my ancestor's strength! They set a trap, but even then, my ancestor fought them to a standstill. With power like his, how could he possibly have died so easily..."

At this point, Wu Mengchuan suddenly shut his mouth. His previously excited mood seemed to calm down a little.
