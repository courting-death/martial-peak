## Chapter 100 — Evil Qi Envelops the Body

Just as Nu Lang was about to make up his mind, Yang Kai suddenly ceased his assault, furrowing his brow in deep thought.

In the next moment, a sound erupted, and a fiery red glow burst forth in the darkness, startling Nu Lang so much that his soul nearly fled.

Focusing his gaze, he saw that Yang Kai’s body was now enveloped in a blazing layer of fire.

This was not ordinary flame, but rather the outward manifestation of his Yuan Qi, condensed to an intense degree. The scorching red energy wrapped around him, sending waves of heat that seemed to repel the valley’s oppressive Yin energy, preventing it from gathering nearby.

Yang Kai’s face was lit unevenly by the fiery glow, his upper body bare, muscles taut and refined, exuding an untamed, unrestrained aura, as if commanding the ebb and flow of battle.

His fists were bloodied and mangled, and across his abdomen was a half-foot-long sword wound, still oozing fresh blood, flesh torn and twisted in a terrifying sight. His eyes shone a deep crimson, like a trapped beast radiating boundless madness and a thirst for blood.

An aura of malevolent energy surged forth!

Nu Lang’s expression turned horrified as he hastily retreated several steps, screaming out, “Demonic madness?”

He had thought Yang Kai had lost control of his Yuan Qi in battle, allowing it to run rampant and consume his sanity.

But such a phenomenon should only occur in realms beyond Qi Movement, should it not? How could a mere Open Origin Realm warrior like Yang Kai exhibit such a state?

“Demonic madness?” Yang Kai glanced at him coldly, his eyes terrifying yet composed, lacking the deranged look of one truly possessed. He sneered disdainfully, “Short-sighted fool!”

As he spoke, the fiery Yuan Qi enveloping his body abruptly withdrew, the blazing light vanishing into the night, leaving only his two fists wrapped in a layer of burning True Yang Yuan Qi.

It appeared as if those fists were clutching twin flames, flickering in the wind yet never extinguishing.

“You still have your sanity?” Nu Lang stared at Yang Kai with suspicion, searching for any trace of humanity in his eyes. But he was disappointed; those crimson orbs held no hint of compassion, only wild battle intent and a murderous aura.

This should have been the state of a madman—his eyes devoid of humanity—so why was Yang Kai still capable of thought?

“Do you think I don’t?” Yang Kai stepped forward, closing the distance between them to the utmost limit. Nu Lang was shocked beyond measure, never expecting Yang Kai’s speed to have reached such a level.

In a panic, he retreated while sweeping out a claw, attempting to block Yang Kai’s advance.

Yang Kai’s blazing right fist smashed into Nu Lang’s outstretched fingers with a fierce roar of wind.

A crisp crack echoed, followed by Nu Lang’s terrified scream as his body was flung high into the air like a kite. When he landed, a searing pain shot through his fingers, which were twisted and unable to straighten.

His fingers were badly burned, and the bones were shattered!

Moreover, a fierce and domineering heat energy invaded his body, scorching his meridians and flesh along its path.

Nu Lang dared not delay, hastily pressing his other hand against his arm to suppress the invading energy.

No sooner had he done so than the light before him suddenly brightened. Looking up, he saw Yang Kai had closed in beside him again, the flames on his fists burning even brighter.

Nu Lang no longer dared to linger in battle. Only now did he realize that as a newly minted Qi Movement Realm First Stage warrior, he was no match for Yang Kai, an Open Origin Realm cultivator.

Summoning all his strength, Nu Lang shifted his feet and retreated swiftly, letting out a long howl filled with panic and terror that echoed far and wide.

Beneath Yang Kai’s feet, flames flickered and his speed surged to a level that even he found astonishing. Like a shadow, he pursued Nu Lang relentlessly, each fist striking with brutal force.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

Nu Lang took blow after blow, utterly unable to resist, his head spinning and consciousness fading.

After fifty paces, Nu Lang finally realized he could not escape Yang Kai’s pursuit. His youthful blood surged with defiance, and he suddenly stopped, his face twisted in a savage snarl as he roared, “Yang Kai, do not push me too far! Eagle Soars the Sky—die!”

This was Nu Lang’s most powerful claw technique, channeling all his Yuan Qi into his hands. Crossing them protectively before his chest, he suddenly tore them apart with a reverse motion aimed at Yang Kai’s torso.

The full force of a Qi Movement Realm First Stage warrior’s attack was not to be underestimated, even by Yang Kai. Seeing the immense destructive power in those hands, his expression grew grave.

If caught, Yang Kai’s chest would likely be torn open.

In a flash, Yang Kai instinctively twisted his body aside. His flaming fists still smashed fiercely toward Nu Lang’s face.

Both fought with all they had—this was a final strike, a desperate clash of life and death. One would fall.

Bang!

Yang Kai’s fist struck Nu Lang’s face, distorting his once handsome features. Driven by the force, Nu Lang was thrown backward, flipping several times before crashing to the ground with a heavy thud.

Swish!

Nu Lang’s claws struck Yang Kai’s chest as expected, but the anticipated scene of Yang Kai’s body being torn open did not occur. Instead, ten bloody scratches—five shallow, five deep—were left on his chest.

At the crucial moment, Yang Kai’s sidestep played a vital role. One of Nu Lang’s finger bones had already been broken earlier. When Eagle Soars the Sky was unleashed, the force in his hands was uneven—some light, some heavy. Yang Kai’s sidestep exploited this imbalance, preventing both hands from exerting full power simultaneously, effectively breaking the technique.

This counter was a stroke of genius born of instinct. In the heat of battle, Yang Kai had little time to think, yet this solution was nothing short of masterful.

The scene suddenly fell silent. The deadly struggle had reached its conclusion. Yang Kai breathed heavily, still enveloped in that sinister aura, while Nu Lang lay sprawled on the ground like a dead dog, his face bloodied and mangled, glaring at Yang Kai with venomous hatred.

“I won’t let you go even in death!” Nu Lang spat through the blood rolling in his throat, his voice filled with malice.

Yang Kai looked down at him and raised his foot, stomping down fiercely.

“Hahaha… The Blood Battle Gang will come to kill you once they receive my signal…” Nu Lang’s words were cut short as Yang Kai crushed his neck, ending his life instantly.

The five warriors from Fengyu Tower were utterly annihilated!

Standing silently, feeling the boiling blood and surging battle intent within, Yang Kai’s expression darkened as a wild thought surged in his mind.
