## Chapter 728 — You're Looking in the Wrong Place

On the boundless sea, a huge iron ship rode the wind and waves, pressing westward at great speed.

The ship was laden with cultivation supplies, and the crew were all disciples of the Water Divine Hall.

Yang Kai stood at the prow, gazing toward the western lands, his thoughts soaring; since beginning dual cultivation with Su Yan, the two of them had seemingly never been apart for so long, and the deep longing in his heart was like well-aged wine—the longer it rested, the more fragrant and concentrated.

He had stayed on Shui Ling Island for roughly half a month, and taking advantage of this trade between the Water Divine Hall and the Ice Sect, Yang Kai had come along on the ship.

During that fortnight, Shui Ling had taken excellent care of him, providing every convenience and repeatedly urging Yang Kai to join the Water Divine Hall; regrettably, Yang Kai never gave in.

When it was time to leave, Shui Ling was sulking and did not even come to bid Yang Kai farewell.

During those two weeks Yang Kai, through Shui Ling, also located the medicinal herb needed to refine that sacred pill.

Shuilan City did not have this herb, but for the Water Divine Hall it was not too difficult to obtain.

Although the ship did not sail as fast as Yang Kai could fly, it was by no means slow, and the iron vessel appeared to have been forged with secret arts, bearing traces of Secret Treasure; even if it encountered Demonic Beast attacks at sea, it would not be destroyed at once.

Several Transcendent Realm experts were stationed on the ship to guard against the unexpected.

He Pu of Yinyun Dao had come on this trip to handle the trade with the Ice Sect. Though the Ice Sect was powerful, with many masters and a cold demeanor, precisely because of that they kept faith in trade. The Water Divine Hall had cooperated with them for years; both sides trusted each other, and once the goods were delivered they could obtain large quantities of ice-attributed Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine from the Ice Sect.

Moreover, the Ice Sect’s territory produced abundant ice-attribute ore, another valuable resource the Water Divine Hall needed.

"Young Master Yang." He Pu appeared beside Yang Kai with a servile smile. "In another half month we should reach the glacial region. Then we'll disembark and fly over. The person you're looking for is somewhere within that ice realm."

"What kind of Sect is the Ice Sect?" Yang Kai turned to look at him.

"I'm not too clear on that either," He Pu replied with an awkward smile.

"You don't know either? Don't you trade with them regularly?"

"We do trade, yes, but I have never actually been inside the Ice Sect. Every transaction is held on a glacier, some distance from the Sect itself. The Ice Sect people—aside from being cold toward others—always wear sour expressions, as if we owed them money. They're extremely wary of outsiders, believing the Ice Sect to be a pure place and that outsiders would only bring filth to that immaculate world; anyone who dares approach is not treated kindly."

"So you don't know exactly where the Ice Sect is?" Yang Kai frowned.

He Pu shook his head, cleared his throat and said, "Our Miss instructed that if this trip goes poorly, Young Master Yang should return to Shui Ling Island; she will await your arrival there."

Yang Kai smiled wryly, "That little girl—she's scheming after me, is she?"

He Pu's mouth twitched; he had never heard anyone call the Miss a "little girl" like that. Young Master Yang's tone was unusually bold, and his relationship with the Miss was clearly not ordinary.

"It's windy and rough out there, let's head inside," He Pu said with a smile. "The brothers have prepared food and wine and would be honored if Young Master Yang would join us."

"All right." Yang Kai nodded and followed He Pu into the cabin.

Although He Pu and the others did not know exactly what Yang Kai's relationship with Shui Ling was, they suspected something; Shui Ling treated Yang Kai exceptionally, and they naturally wished to win his favor.

Yang Kai took things as they came and soon blended with the crew, passing cups and toasting; the scene was warm and lively.

Days passed and the air grew noticeably colder; as the iron ship continued forward, they were gradually entering an icy world.

The waves on the sea had weakened considerably, and thin ice rimmed the ship.

As time went on, the situation grew more severe.

Yang Kai knew they were drawing ever closer to that glacier world, and his heart filled with boundless expectation and exhilaration.

Half a month later the ship halted; the sea ahead had frozen completely, thick, goose-feather snow drifted down, and the ice on the sea was several feet thick.

The ship could go no further.

He Pu skillfully directed the crew to pack the ship's supplies into Spatial Pouches and prepare to board the glacier.

After a round of busy work, everything was in order.

A few men were left to look after the iron ship; the rest leapt down and, braving the bitter wind, advanced westward.

The temperature here was extremely low; even warriors like He Pu wore many cold-resistant garments, while Yang Kai wore light clothes yet did not feel cold—instead his face bore a ruddy glow. He Pu and the others clicked their tongues in astonishment, wondering what cultivation Yang Kai possessed to remain unaffected in such cruel conditions.

Before them lay a field of snow-white; the glacier world seemed utterly pure, without the slightest stain, as pristine as a newborn's gaze.

The party sped onward for several days; only then did the lead Transcendent Realm member suddenly make a hand signal.

They stopped and squinted into the distance.

In that snowy world ahead, several figures seemed to stand clad in white robes, entirely indistinguishable against the immaculate backdrop.

Yang Kai could sense the life auras those people emitted, but he did not reveal it.

After observing for a moment, the leader confirmed it, his expression brightening, and he hurried forward.

Moments later they arrived at the location of those people.

These few should be disciples of the Ice Sect, Yang Kai glanced over and felt a slight chill at heart.

Although their faces were stern and indifferent, somewhat unapproachable, no matter their cultivation, each person's True Yuan was exceedingly pure, their whole beings radiating a piercing cold.

It was well known that the harsher the environment, the stronger the warriors it forged.

Living in this isolated glacial realm, it was nearly impossible for Ice Sect disciples not to become powerful.

It seemed Shopkeeper Meng had put thought into entrusting Su Yan here; given Su Yan's temperament, this place truly suited her.

The two parties were acquainted, yet the lead Ice Sect disciple still showed some impatience when he saw the Water Divine Hall members and asked coldly, "Why have you come a bit late this time?"

He Pu hurriedly smiled and replied, "Sorry, sorry, some matters delayed our journey and kept you waiting."

"There had better not be a next time," the man snorted.

He Pu was so taken aback he could barely speak, his eyes rolling in exasperation; he fell silent and promptly ordered the pouches gathered so the Ice Sect could verify the goods.

After the inspection, the Ice Sect leader nodded faintly, satisfied with the Water Divine Hall's delivery, then took two Spatial Pouches from his robe and handed them to He Pu.

He Pu counted them and smiled, "All right, this handover was smooth; pleasant cooperation."

The Ice Sect members turned and left without offering a single polite word.

"Everyone, wait!" He Pu called out hastily.

The leader turned and, displeased, asked, "What else?"

"It's like this—I'd like to inquire after someone." Yang Kai stepped forward and cupped his hands.

"Inquire after someone? Who?" the man frowned, clearly impatient.

"A woman named Su Yan; she should be within your Ice Sect."

"Su Yan?"

"Yes, she entered your Ice Sect two years ago. If possible, I would like to see her…"

"The Ice Sect has no such person; you're looking in the wrong place!" The man cut him off before Yang Kai could finish, waved his hand, and left without looking back.

Yang Kai felt a trace of anger, but did not lose his temper; he only watched their departing backs coldly.

Soon those people melted into the wind and snow and vanished from sight.

"Young Master Yang, this…" He Pu looked at Yang Kai with sympathy. Though he had long known Ice Sect people were hard to approach, this group was excessively indifferent and gave no opportunity to speak.

"You all go back first, and tell Shui Ling I thank her for this time; if there's a chance later I'll thank her in person."

"But the Miss said if things go poorly we must bring you back no matter what, so you won't be bullied here," He Pu said, frowning.

"I appreciate her kindness; tell her I'm insisting on staying of my own accord." Yang Kai chuckled and patted He Pu on the shoulder. "And thanks for your efforts this time."

He Pu, flattered and surprised, hurriedly smiled, "Young Master Yang flatters me. I wish you swift success; if matters are impossible, please leave early. The Ice Sect people are not to be trifled with."

"I know. Farewell, everyone." Yang Kai cupped his fists and, pursuing those Ice Sect disciples, swiftly departed.

Watching his disappearing figure, He Pu sighed and could only lead the others back along the same route.

Yang Kai subtly released his Divine Sense, locking onto those Ice Sect disciples and tailing their path from afar.

He was certain that those people knew Su Yan.

Though the speaker had been impeccable, a young woman beside him had her beautiful eyes flash and showed a momentary look of surprise when Yang Kai spoke Su Yan's name.

Though she quickly suppressed it, Yang Kai had seen it all.

Yang Kai did not know why they denied Su Yan's existence, but without seeing her in person he could not rest easy.

A faint unease lingered in his heart, as if something untoward were about to happen.

By rights, Su Yan had been entrusted to the Ice Sect by Meng Wuya; Shopkeeper Meng had some friendship with the Ice Sect's leader, and that friendship was surely good—otherwise Meng Wuya would not have done this.

Yang Kai trusted Shopkeeper Meng!

Given that, Su Yan should not be wronged within the Ice Sect, yet that lingering unease put Yang Kai on alert—he swore to find Su Yan and see how she was faring now.
