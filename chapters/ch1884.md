## Chapter 1884 — Blood Jiao and Thousand Eyes

"What a joke — Di Chen was five million li away, and you call this stepping over the line?" Shen Tu sneered, "Are you asleep?"

Yu Xiong cocked his head at him, then looked at Yang Kai and said, "Brother-in-law, does it matter if I kill him? The way this brat talks really gets on my nerves."

At those words, the atmosphere between the human and yao clans — which had only just calmed — abruptly tightened; Chun Yi's Saint Yuan surged and fell, her face full of murderous intent as she stared at Yu Xiong. Ba He, naturally, would not be outdone; he extended his Divine Sense to lock onto Chun Yi. Everyone else readied themselves, swords drawn and bows taut, as if another fight might break out at any moment.

"Enough!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, and the majesty of his Void King Realm quietly radiated outward.

Sensing that power, Ba He cried out in astonishment, "Yang Kai… you are already at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm?"

He nearly bit his tongue, staring at Yang Kai in utter disbelief, unable to accept his own perception.

Earlier, when he had seen Yang Kai, he had vaguely felt that Yang Kai had grown much stronger since last time, but he had not paid it much mind; only when Yang Kai displayed that power did he understand that the other's cultivation had surpassed him, reaching the Second Stage!

How could that be possible?

Back when he first met Yang Kai, Yang Kai had only been at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Even after they went through the Blood Prison Trial together, he was still only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

It had only been a few short years since they last met — yet Yang Kai had already reached the Second Stage of the Void King Realm? Was it truly possible for someone in this world to advance at such a terrifying speed?

Ba He stood there stunned.

"What? Second Stage of the Void King Realm? Senior Ba He, are you sure you aren't mistaken?" Yu Xiong also widened his eyes and asked in astonishment.

"How could I be mistaken about something like this?" Ba He swallowed, his voice dry, seeming somewhat shaken by the news.

Anyone who learned of Yang Kai's speed of cultivation could not remain calm; compared to Yang Kai's aptitude and rate of ascent, Ba He felt as if he had wasted these past years.

Yu Xiong was stunned for a moment, then burst out laughing, "No wonder he's my fine brother-in-law — only someone like you could be worthy of my Little Sister!"

He was sincere; he truly rejoiced for Shan Qingluo.

Hearing Shan Qingluo's name, Yang Kai's expression softened. He said, "Show some face for one another. No matter the cause of today's affair, luckily there were no casualties — let it end here."

As he spoke, he glanced at Ba He, then at Shen Tu.

Ba He said, "There is no real hatred. Since these people were brought by you, Yang Kai, this old man certainly will not entangle himself."

Shen Tu snorted, "I'll give Brother Yang face — I won't stoop to the same level as you yao."

"That's fine," Yang Kai nodded lightly, and looked to Yu Xiong, asking, "How is Qingluo now?"

"My Little Sister?" Yu Xiong scratched his head and smiled, "She's doing well. Since returning from the Blood Prison, she's been in seclusion; when she comes out she'll ascend to the Void King Realm. Our adoptive mother thinks highly of her — you needn't worry."

"What about Senior Chi Yue?" Yang Kai asked.

"Our adoptive mother is in seclusion as well," Yu Xiong grinned.

Yang Kai suddenly thought of something.

"Exactly," Yu Xiong laughed loudly, "when adoptive mother emerges, Di Chen will belong to my Red Moon Domain."

Chi Yue was already a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, and now that she had obtained Yao King Feng E's Void Mind Crystal and entered seclusion, if she succeeded in breaking through she would become the only yao of Yao King rank on Di Chen Star.

Only yao who advanced to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm could be called Yao Kings! At present, Chi Yue was only a Domain Lord.

The status of a Yao King was supreme, commanding the yao; when that time came Di Chen Star would surely fall under her rule.

"Then congratulations are in order for Senior Chi Yue," Yang Kai said, his expression shifting, "If it's convenient, I'd like to visit the Red Moon Domain and see Senior Chi Yue — Brother Yu, could you lead the way?"

"Call me brother-in-law and I'll take you!" Yu Xiong chuckled.

Yang Kai ignored him and turned his gaze to Ba He.

Ba He wore a troubled expression and said slowly, "Yang Kai, you are not an outsider; we naturally welcome you to Di Chen's Red Moon Domain, but if you wish to see the Lord now, this may not be the right time — the Lord is in seclusion and must not be disturbed."

"I understand that," Yang Kai replied, "Chi Yue is not in total isolation; I only need to say a few words — I won't disturb her long."

Ba He frowned deeply. Yu Xiong no longer interjected, aware this was a serious matter not for him to decide.

"Rest assured," Yang Kai said, "if Senior Chi Yue bears any grudges against you, I'll take the blame. Besides… I believe Senior Chi Yue will be pleased by the news I bring and won't fault you."

"Ah!" Ba He sighed, "You've put it like that — what else can I say?"

"Then thank you, Senior Ba He," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

At Yang Kai's intended destination, Shen Tu's face changed slightly as he asked in a low voice, "Brother Yang, you intend to go to Di Chen?"

"Yes, I need to see Senior Chi Yue," Yang Kai nodded slightly. "And you all — will you wait here, or accompany me to Di Chen?"

Shen Tu looked reluctant. After a moment he said, "The yao are ruthless; I will go with you so there is someone to watch your back. Besides, I want to see what a yao star is like."

"Then let's go together!" Yang Kai smiled slightly, unconcerned.

Shen Tu relayed the message and the others obeyed. Soon another warship rose from the Meteorite Sea — one of the yao-held warships.

The yao were not skilled in alchemy or artifact-crafting, but Di Chen Star was not solely yao — humans lived there too, though they ranked lower.

Di Chen Star had ten domains and ten lords, and each lord treated humans differently: some left them be, some slaughtered them, some entrusted them with heavy work…

In the Red Moon Domain, humans were most often put to use, especially alchemists and artificers, whose status could even be higher than ordinary yao; thus in recent years the Red Moon Domain's development had outpaced the others.

Many talented humans went to the Red Moon Domain to volunteer their service to Chi Yue.

The warship that Ba He and Yu Xiong had taken was forged by human artificers; although only of Origin-Grade Middle-Level, it was sufficient for mid-range travel.

The two warships sailed side by side toward Di Chen Star at incredible speed.

Five million li was covered in little more than a day and a night.

Half Moon Mountain housed the Red Moon Palace, Chi Yue's residence and the most important place in the Red Moon Domain.

When the two warships broke through the clouds above Half Moon Mountain, they saw that the mountain below was shrouded by a vast energy light-membrane that radiated dazzling brilliance.

Outside that energy membrane many yao experts had gathered; two at the head of them were overflowing with qi and blood, yao qi surging up as if to pierce the clouds.

One of them had wild hair and a physique about a third more hulking than Yu Xiong's, wearing a fitted short shirt with his chest exposed and muscles bulging — he looked exceedingly bold and coarse.

The other was much more effeminate, not rough and unruly like most yao but rather carrying a human-like elegance; his eyes were a pale silver, and when they shifted a silver light flashed, as if some mysterious power lay within.

Many yao were attacking that layer of light-membrane; the coarse-looking yao roared, "Chi Yue, we traveled a long way and you shut Half Moon Mountain — is this how you receive guests? Do you look down on Xue Jiao?"

At those words his identity became immediately clear: he was Xue Jiao, one of the ten Domain Lords, the Lord of the Blood Jiao, and he was said to be the lord on Di Chen Star most hostile to humans — in his domain there were no humans except as slaves; the rest had been slaughtered.

There was still no response from within Half Moon Mountain.

The effeminate yao beside Blood Jiao said in a low voice, "Brother Xue Jiao, why ask when the answer is obvious? Chi Yue plainly refuses us face. We are both Domain Lords; to visit and be shut out like this is outrageous."

"If she won't give Xue Jiao face, then I needn't give her face either," Xue Jiao raged, and shouted, "Chi Yue, my son Xue Lian left here years ago for the Blood Prison Trial and died there — I still haven't settled that account with you. Today you further humiliate me; fine, at worst we'll part ways and settle this by battle for the title of lord — do you have the guts?"

Still there was no reply from inside.

Xue Jiao's eyes reddened and he hissed, turning to the effeminate yao, "Brother Qian Yan, this woman refuses battle — what should we do?"

The Thousand-Eyed Lord narrowed his eyes and said, "We have already wasted too much time. Since she won't respond, we'll force our way in. In no case can we allow her to refine Yao King Feng E's Void Mind Crystal — if she succeeds and becomes a Yao King, Di Chen will have no place left for you or me!"

Hearing that, Xue Jiao's eyes flashed with a hint of fear, and he ground his teeth, "Very well. Then I ask Brother Qian Yan to join forces with me to break the Half Moon Mountain barrier!"

"Be careful, Brother Xue Jiao — Half Moon Mountain can absorb the moon's essence and is said to possess the power of half a moon. Once the barrier is activated it is not something that can be broken casually."

Xue Jiao sneered, "A barrier is but a lifeless thing; why fear it when we join forces? Brother Qian Yan, you've been overly cautious. Don't forget that not only did my son die in the Blood Prison — your son did too! And the human who killed them left from Chi Yue’s place. If you tell me there’s nothing fishy about that, I wouldn’t believe it even if I were beaten to death.”

At his words the Thousand-Eyed Lord's silver eyes filled with killing intent and he bellowed, "Then we strike together!"

The two Domain Lords exchanged glances and both drew on their internal yao yuan; in an instant the world hummed as surging yao qi condensed into substance and poured from their skins. The spectacle was terrifying; the yao who had accompanied them felt that pressure and all turned pale, retreating for fear of being swept up.
