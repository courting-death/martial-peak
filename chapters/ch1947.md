## Chapter 1947 — Slander

Before refining pills, Yang Kai had asked around in the market and of a few Biyu Sect disciples he had befriended earlier about the Star Realm's pill-refining techniques.

He found the Star Realm's pill-refining to be extraordinarily profound, not even on the same level as that of the Star Domain.

For example, take the final condensation: in the Star Realm even ordinary alchemists could once condense two or three Spiritual Pills at a time, unlike the Star Domain where a single batch of materials would only yield one Spiritual Pill.

The reason was that the Star Realm's pill-condensing techniques and methods had already become widespread, and virtually any alchemical technique could be learned.

However, every furnace's final yield had its limit.

For instance, the batch Yang Kai was now refining—the Luo King Fuye Pill—was a Void King-Grade, Middle-Level Spiritual Pill; for Yang Kai producing it was not difficult, and if he went all out he could certainly produce pills bearing Pill Patterns.

Such a batch, which consumed seventeen kinds of raw materials to produce, even the most formidable alchemist could only condense nine pills at most in the final condensation.

Nine Spiritual Pills was the limit for that batch of Luo King Fuye Pills; any more would be impossible even if an Emperor intervened.

Different Spiritual Pills and different prescriptions yielded different final quantities.

To achieve the full maximum yield for a Void King-Grade, Middle-Level Spiritual Pill required at least a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist to produce it successfully.

Yang Kai's current limit was six!

During the refining process he continually became familiar with his pill-condensing methods, testing them against the Great Dao Pill Tone imprinted in his Sea of Consciousness. His alchemy improved rapidly.

In barely an hour the Luo King Fuye Pills capable of restoring a Void King Realm warrior's Origin Qi were finished; the number condensed also reached Yang Kai's personal limit—six!

He stuffed three of them into his Spatial Ring and tossed the remaining three into a jade bottle he had prepared long ago.

The Spiritual Pills in the jade bottle were for those seeking pills; three was enough to satisfy their needs. As for the extra Spiritual Pills, Yang Kai naturally pocketed them for himself.

So after these days of refining, Yang Kai had not only earned a considerable amount of Origin Crystals, but had also privately hoarded many Spiritual Pills of various uses; if he sold them, it would certainly be a sizable fortune.

Unfortunately he could only refine Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills for now. He had no materials for Dao Origin-Grade to practice with; otherwise Yang Kai would have liked to try refining a Dao Origin-Grade pill to see whether he had reached that standard.

After sealing the jade bottle, Yang Kai casually tossed it and inwardly marveled at how easy it was for an alchemist to earn cultivation resources.

Just as he was about to call Liu Qianyun in to collect the pills, Liu Qianyun's sharp admonition suddenly rang at his ear, followed by the clatter of commotion.

Yang Kai's expression darkened; he rose at once and rushed out like a whirlwind.

Outside, Yang Kai scanned the scene and saw Liu Qianyun standing with a sour expression, while the sign that had been in front of her lay on the ground, trampled under the foot of a martial artist wearing Biyu Sect robes, already smashed into several pieces.

Outside the shop, those martial artists who had been queuing for pills frowned one by one, dispersed, and watched from a distance.

Seeing Yang Kai appear, Liu Qianyun seemed to find her anchor and hurried over to him.

"What's going on?" Yang Kai asked, frowning.

He had been refining pills here with Liu Qianyun for nearly a month and had offended no one, so he could not fathom why someone would wreck the place today.

"They say the pills you refined have problems," Liu Qianyun said in a low voice as she came to Yang Kai's side.

"What kind of problems?" Yang Kai asked, glancing across.

"They didn't explain clearly; when they came they just acted," Liu Qianyun said, biting her lower lip, her face full of grievance as she stared at the sign now in tatters under that martial artist's foot.

Because she worked with Yang Kai refining pills and he generously gave her thirty percent of the profits, Liu Qianyun had been diligent; feeling she could not assist him in alchemy, she focused on perfecting the sign.

She had painstakingly crafted the sign's design—every character and every stroke; she had put much thought into it, taking it out each morning, putting it into her Spatial Ring when she left, and carefully polishing it at night so the sign remained spotless.

This was the only way she could help Yang Kai.

But now the sign, which embodied all her effort, had been reduced to tatters, and Liu Qianyun was naturally extremely upset.

"You smash things before clarifying?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and snorted coldly, realizing that although he had kept a low profile, helping others refine pills must have blocked someone's profits—otherwise why would this happen?

"You're the alchemist here?" The martial artist standing on the sign looked at Yang Kai arrogantly, a cold smile at his lips, and asked bluntly.

"Indeed I am. May I ask how Senior Brother is called?" Yang Kai said coldly, looking at him.

"Very well—I'm Chu Fei, a disciple under Protector Zhu!" the man replied.

Yang Kai's heart stirred; he knew that the 'Protector Zhu' referred to was Zhu Junshan, one of the Biyu Sect's Four Great Protectors. This man's cultivation, like Bian Yuqing's, was the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—far beyond what Yang Kai could reach at present.

However, because the Four Great Protectors did not get along well with one another, if it were not for the Sect Master holding things down, the Biyu Sect would likely have already fallen apart. For that reason, relationships among disciples under the Protectors were also not peaceful.

Within the sect, disciples often quarreled and even fought privately leading to injuries; outside the sect the situation was even more blatant.

Hearing that the man was under Protector Zhu, Yang Kai knew he had come to pick a quarrel.

"So it's Senior Brother Chu. May I ask why Senior Brother smashed Junior Brother's sign?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

"Don't play dumb in front of Chu," Chu Fei snorted coldly, putting on an air of seriousness.

"I've only been in the sect about a month; I don't believe I have offended Senior Brother Chu—please explain!" Yang Kai said, shaking his head.

Chu Fei chuckled and nodded. "Fine. Since you put it that way, Senior Brother will make it clear to you!"

With that he waved his hand. "Bring him over!"

Not far behind him, several martial artists immediately carried over a stretcher. On it lay a man in a pitiful state; his force surged and ebbed uncontrollably—sometimes quiet, sometimes violently tumultuous. The man seemed to have lost control of himself; his eyes were bloodshot and he emitted vicious, meaningless cries.

Even while lying on the stretcher he struggled fiercely, but a layer of restraining formation bound him from the outside, leaving him unable to move.

"Qi Deviation!" an onlooker cried.

The condition of the man on the stretcher was clearly Qi Deviation; he had most likely suffered a mishap during secluded cultivation, causing his force to go out of control—if not contained, he would be ruined.

But suppressing Qi Deviation was extremely difficult; unless a great practitioner with powerful techniques intervened, one could not turn the tide alone.

This was a fate every martial artist dreaded—once encountered, one's life would be over.

"Junior Brother, do you recognize this person?" Chu Fei asked coldly, pointing at the man on the stretcher.

Yang Kai glanced and nodded. "I have some impression—he seemed to have requested a pill from me five days ago."

At these words Liu Qianyun's pretty face went pale.

She was no fool and had a vague idea of what would follow; she looked at Yang Kai, filled with worry.

"It's enough that you admit it," Chu Fei sneered. "This Junior Brother Jiang is a born genius—young yet already at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm; his future is boundless. Even Protector Zhu has praised him time and again, calling him the most talented disciple of our branch."

"So what?" Yang Kai said indifferently, looking at Chu Fei.

Chu Fei's face turned cold; in a vicious tone he said, "But he was ruined by your hand; Junior Brother, what do you have to say about that?"

"Senior Brother, you jest," Yang Kai said with a short laugh. "This Junior Brother Jiang suffered Qi Deviation during cultivation—how could I have ruined him? What does this have to do with me?"

"You still don't admit it? If he hadn't taken the Spiritual Pill you made, how would he have had Qi Deviation? You yourself just said he requested a pill from you five days ago!" Chu Fei barked.

At Chu Fei's words, the faces of the surrounding onlookers instantly changed; after all, they had been queuing to have Yang Kai refine pills—if his Spiritual Pills were indeed problematic, who would dare to seek him out?

They felt a measure of relief—fortunate that Chu Fei had come in time; otherwise they might have been the next Junior Brother Jiang.

"Indeed, he did request a pill from me five days ago, but that doesn't mean his Qi Deviation has anything to do with me. Perhaps his own foundations were unstable. There are many causes for Qi Deviation. Senior Brother, to slander me without investigating the facts—is that fair?" Yang Kai said coldly, looking at Chu Fei.

The other was only a Third Stage of the Void King Realm; Yang Kai felt no fear. The only thing that worried him was whether Chu Fei had backing from other forces.

He wouldn't have come to bother him for no reason. In the marketplace there were several alchemists and shops who refined pills for others, but they had all been set up by Biyu Sect disciples themselves and had no direct relation to the Protectors.

"Senior Brother isn't slandering you. Junior Brother Jiang requested a pill from you five days ago, returned to seclusion, and within a few days suffered Qi Deviation. Now look at him—don't say it's mere coincidence. Protector Zhu himself has said he has innate talent—how could his foundation be unstable? I can't find a second reason other than that the Spiritual Pill you refined was faulty!"

"Indeed, when Junior Brother Jiang returned that day after requesting the pill he wore a beaming face, saying he had gotten a great bargain. I even advised him to have the pill's quality verified, but he was eager to enter seclusion. Now it seems cheap goods are never good—who would have thought he would encounter trouble after only a few days of seclusion," echoed a Biyu Sect disciple who had come with Chu Fei.
