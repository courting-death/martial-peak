## Chapter 1173 — Someone Forcing Sales Again?

About half a day later, Qian Tong brought those two hundred-plus people to the vicinity of Flowing Flame Sandland, hurriedly instructed his disciples and the martial artists who had followed him, then went off to look for the Origin Returning Stage experts from Yingyue Hall.

As if by prior agreement, with the arrival of Yingyue Hall's contingent, wave after wave of martial artists showed up; they all sought unoccupied spots, some clustering into tight groups, others gathering in threes and fives.

Those huddled together were disciples of great powers, while the small clusters were members of minor families and small sects, making the outer ring of Flowing Flame Sandland sharply divided.

In less than a day, the number of martial artists gathered here had already reached over two thousand; there were likely still some who hadn't arrived yet, otherwise the total would have been even higher.

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er were squeezed among Yingyue Hall's numerous disciples, surrounded in a star-and-moon formation by nearly seventy people; Wei Guchang wore a stern expression as he privately instructed his fellow disciples, and the Saint King Realm men and women all nodded in agreement.

Yang Kai did not see disciples from Leitai Sect, Battle Sky Alliance, or Liuli Gate here — they probably entered through other entrances. Flowing Flame Sandland didn't have just the single access in front of them; according to Wei Guchang there were four entrances in all directions, and each great power chose the closest one, so they weren't all congregating in one place.

Compared to the clamour around him, Yang Kai sat alone with legs crossed in a secluded spot, looking solitary. No one came to make trouble; those who had witnessed his and Wei Guchang's might before naturally didn't dare provoke him, and later arrivals seemed to realize Yang Kai wasn't someone to be trifled with. No one dared approach.

The martial artists from minor families, however, were always flanked by disciples of great powers; the intent of these people was obvious — they wanted to buy the pass tokens from those minor family fighters.

But as more people arrived, those great power disciples no longer dared to bully others the way Yin Jianzhong had; they courteously persuaded the minor family folk and offered sufficiently sincere compensation. In fact, some minor family martial artists gave up their plans to enter Flowing Flame Sandland and instead sold their pass tokens.

Still, there were some who were resolute in entering Flowing Flame Sandland to seek profit and opportunity; no amount of pleading from the surrounding great power disciples could change their minds, which made those disciples extremely vexed.

As Yang Kai’s gaze swept past a certain spot, it suddenly froze. He let out a soft “Hm?” and slowly rose to his feet, walking in that direction.

In that direction stood two middle-aged elders, both wearing bitter smiles as they stood in place. Around them, like other minor family folk, a few people had gathered; those people were taking turns coaxing and tempting them with profit, trying to buy their pass tokens.

"One hundred and fifty thousand — one hundred and fifty thousand Saint Crystal, no higher. Go ask around if that price is fair! One hundred and fifty thousand Saint Crystal is still a sizeable sum for us; what do you two seniors think? If it's acceptable, then we have a deal," a middle-aged man said with earnest persuasion. Although he and the two elders shared the same Saint King Third Stage cultivation, the elders were older and he was asking a favor, so calling them "seniors" was no great matter.

One of the two elders cupped his hands slightly and forced a smile. "Gentlemen, it's not that we don't want to show face, it's just that we haven't seen what the pass tokens look like. Our passes are in the hands of Elder Qian of Yingyue Hall and haven't been distributed yet."

"That's fine," the middle-aged man laughed heartily. "They'll be handed out soon; once you receive them, just give them to me. I can hand over the Saint Crystals first!"

The middle-aged man spoke with genuine seeming sincerity and even began to count the Saint Crystal.

The two elders exchanged a glance, helpless. One hundred and fifty thousand Saint Crystal was indeed a hefty sum for them, but compared to that, they preferred to enter Flowing Flame Sandland.

Once inside they might die, but they might also gain great rewards and even advance to the Origin Returning Stage!

They were old and childless; their greatest wish was to pierce the mysteries of the Origin Returning Stage before they died. For that wish they were willing to fight. What did death matter if they could attain enlightenment?

They truly did not want to sell their pass tokens. This opportunity to enter Flowing Flame Sandland was rare, and fate had arranged it so that it was their turn; if they did not seize such a chance, they would die without peace.

But the other party was already counting Saint Crystal; refusing now would only anger them. Although the two had come with Yingyue Hall, they weren't on close terms with its people — in fact, Elder Qian looked particularly unfavourably upon them. Letting them have two slots to enter Flowing Flame Sandland was already Elder Qian's mercy; why would he interfere over this?

Just as they worried, a familiar voice sounded at their ear: "What, someone forcing sales again?"

The voice carried a touch of mockery. The middle-aged man frozen in counting Saint Crystal's expression went cold and looked toward the source; upon recognizing the newcomer he immediately flashed a smile, cupped his hands and replied cautiously, "Friend, I'm not like those arrogant people from Qingque Gate; I haven't forced anyone. I'm willing to pay one hundred and fifty thousand Saint Crystal for these two elders' passes. Ask around if the price is fair."

He smiled while speaking and hurriedly explained, inwardly thinking bitterly about why this fellow had come to interfere — did he have some connection to the two elders?

The scene of Yang Kai and Wei Guchang dealing with Yin Jianzhong the day before — he had witnessed it from beginning to end. Naturally, he knew this First-Stage Saint King was not someone to provoke. If Yang Kai were truly angered, the matter wouldn’t be settled with one hundred and fifty thousand Saint Crystals, but five hundred thousand!

Five hundred thousand... he shuddered just thinking about it.

"Yang Kai?" The two elders, seeing him, immediately called his name with constrained expressions, appearing uneasy.

"Guest Elder Chang, Guest Elder Hao!" Yang Kai cupped his hands to them in greeting.

He knew these two — otherwise he wouldn't have bothered to intervene. One was Chang Qi, the other Hao An; both were Guest Elders of the Haike Family. He had spent several months with the former in the Starry Sky, and the latter had been often praised by Wu Yi, who frequently said the two Guest Elders had treated her best in the Haike Family. Besides them, there was another Guest Elder named Huang Juan who had been close to her.

Facts proved that claim true: when Ian, the Haike Family's head, went to the city lord's mansion to bring experts to deal with Yang Kai, these three Guest Elders secretly informed Wu Yi in different ways and urged her to leave Dragon Lair Mountain early to avoid disaster.

Although the Haike Family ultimately suffered calamity, their kindness to Wu Yi remained in her heart. She thought of these three often, but after Huang Juan left the Haike Family she vanished and no one knew where she had gone. Chang Qi and Hao An, however, had stayed with the Haike Family and still kept occasional contact with Wu Yi.

Their expressions were embarrassed, clearly because of their status.

Yang Kai’s falling out with the Haike Family had been anything but pleasant. And they still carried the title of Guest Elder under that family’s name, so they now feared above all that Yang Kai might come looking to settle accounts with them.

So when they had seen Yang Kai in the Space Array hall of Tianyun City, they hadn't dared to greet him — partly out of fear and partly out of shame.

Yet now, seeing Yang Kai take the initiative to greet them with a polite bow, the two instantly realized they had misjudged him — they had measured a gentleman’s heart with a petty mind. Yang Kai bore them no grudge at all.

Yang Kai truly did not hold a grudge; the Haike Family incident had mainly been the result of Ian's foolishness, and Chang Qi and Hao An had treated him well. Being remembered fondly by Wu Yi made them worth his help.

"He's trying to buy your pass tokens?" Yang Kai asked.

"Yes." Chang Qi nodded, his expression easing.

"Offering one hundred and fifty thousand Saint Crystal?" Yang Kai asked again.

The two elders nodded once more.

The middle-aged man gave an awkward smile. "Friend, you see — I'm not lying. One hundred and fifty thousand Saint Crystal is indeed not a small price."

"What do you two intend?" Yang Kai ignored the middle-aged man and instead looked at Chang Qi and Hao An. If they meant to sell their passes, he wouldn't pry; after all, it's dangerous inside. But if they were unwilling, that man wouldn't succeed.

Yang Kai himself thought it better they sell. Although one hundred and fifty thousand Saint Crystal wasn't much to him, it was a fortune to Chang Qi and Hao An. They needn't risk their lives; with Saint Crystals in hand, why not?

To his surprise, Chang Qi and Hao An exchanged a look and both shook their heads resolutely. "We don't want to sell. We want to enter Flowing Flame Sandland!"

Yang Kai looked at them in astonishment, then told the middle-aged man, "You heard them: these two elders do not wish to sell their pass tokens."

"Heard, heard," the middle-aged man hastily nodded, keeping up his smile. "Then I won't bother you. Farewell!"

Saying that, he led his companions away in a hurry.

After they left, Chang Qi and Hao An both sighed and stared at Yang Kai in astonishment.

They had arrived late and hadn't seen Qingque Gate's people get beaten, so they didn't understand why the middle-aged man was so afraid of Yang Kai — how a few words could send him packing.

"Come over here, both of you; it's crowded and not convenient to talk." Yang Kai beckoned them toward the spot where he had been resting.

Chang Qi and Hao An felt mixed emotions — grateful and somewhat embarrassed — but they followed Yang Kai's lead.

After a short while, the three left the noisy crowd and reached a quiet place.

There wasn’t much ceremony to it — they all simply sat down cross-legged.
