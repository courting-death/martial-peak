## Chapter 761 — Escape

Looking up, in the blue water ahead a gigantic sword radiating earth-shattering energy trailed them; its icy killing intent sent a chill of gooseflesh over Yang Kai.

And behind that giant sword, Yang Kai could dimly make out the silhouette of the previous-generation Saintess.

She had actually pursued them as well, bearing an expression that sought to utterly exterminate Yang Kai and An Ling'er.

While descending, Yang Kai urgently whispered into An Ling'er's ear, "If you want to live, put some strength into it—there's no time to be gloomy now!"

At his words, An Ling'er hurriedly nodded and sent a thread of True Yuan into Yang Kai's body.

In an instant, Yang Kai felt his True Yuan surge and flow with far greater speed.

The secret art practiced by the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land could temporarily boost Yang Kai's fighting strength; that's why he had insisted on bringing An Ling'er along while escaping.

True Yuan erupted, and the Xuantian Sword—the Nine Heavens Divine Technique—also blazed brilliantly in Yang Kai's hand.

But even with An Ling'er's augmentation, when Yang Kai exerted his full power he could only form a Xuantian Sword just over ten zhang long, a far cry from Saintess Nan's.

The two Nine Heavens Divine Technique moves charged at each other from opposite directions and collided a moment later.

A tremendous muffled boom rang out; Yang Kai's Xuantian Sword was pulverized in an instant, the surrounding seawater surged and gasped, and the feedback force shoved Yang Kai and An Ling'er down a considerable distance.

Saintess Nan's form seemed hindered for an instant, but very quickly she resumed the pursuit.

"Does your Nine Heavens Saintess have any weakness?" Yang Kai asked urgently.

"No weakness unless someone is stronger than her, but I can try to hold her off for a while!" An Ling'er gritted her teeth and, allowing Yang Kai to keep his hold on her as they fell, unleashed a burst of Divine Sense toward Saintess Nan.

Yang Kai faintly heard the sound of a ballad, as if issuing from the depths of a person's soul; beneath the song people involuntarily became languid and relaxed.

His expression hardened—this was clearly a Soul Technique, similar in effect to the one An Ling'er had used before in the Court of Divine Battle, both having a calming and soothing influence.

Saintess Nan was now a dead body propped up by obsession; using a Soul Technique against her was undoubtedly the right approach.

Perception confirmed it: Saintess Nan's movements were indeed affected and slowed somewhat, and the True Yuan fluctuations on her body were wildly unstable, as if she were suffering intense torment.

"That should do it!" Yang Kai's spirit lifted—so long as An Ling'er could delay this Saint Realm woman, he had full confidence of escape.

"I can't hold on long," An Ling'er said softly, her fair face paling.

Yang Kai turned and saw her in pain; he instantly understood that with her cultivation, using a Soul Technique against someone like Saintess Nan would exact a heavy backlash.

Yang Kai's face grew grave as he considered how to buy more time while fleeing.

He had many measures he could deploy, but the gap in power was too great—ordinary methods simply wouldn't work.

The Court of Divine Battle might be useful—it was a Saint-grade Secret Treasure—yet if he used it his own soul would be dragged into that white, misty space; engaging Saintess Nan there in a Divine Sense duel offered no guarantee of victory.

The World-Ending Demon Eye was also supremely powerful, but Saintess Nan's Divine Sense did not press into his Sea of Consciousness, rendering the Demon Eye useless.

Apart from purifying soul energy that had breached Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, it could only absorb the souls of martial artists after death.

By that reasoning, Saintess Nan could not be considered a corpse in the strictest sense; otherwise the World-Ending Demon Eye would already have taken effect.

He thought and thought but found no solution; anxiety churned in Yang Kai's heart.

Just then the ballad that had been ringing in their ears abruptly stopped; the instant it cut off, An Ling'er spat a mouthful of blood mist and collapsed weakly into Yang Kai's arms, gasping and utterly spent.

With An Ling'er no longer restraining her, Saintess Nan regained her previous speed, the gap between her and Yang Kai shrinking.

Fortunately the enormous Xuantian Sword had gone missing; until she closed to a certain range, they were relatively safe.

They dove ever deeper; countless sea beasts and fish swam past, but Yang Kai paid them no heed.

As An Ling'er had said, Saintess Nan cut down every living thing she passed; the sea creatures all suffered and were killed.

Slaying those creatures cost her little effort, but it did slow her pursuit slightly.

Yang Kai had never felt time pass so slowly; pursued from behind by a Saint Realm powerhouse like a maggot clinging to a bone, his life was under threat every moment — it felt as if each heartbeat stretched into a year.

When a dazzling shimmer from a coral cluster flashed below, Yang Kai felt a jolt and whispered, "We're almost there!"

Hearing him, An Ling'er opened her eyes weakly and asked, "At this point, can you at least tell me your name? If I die, I should at least know whose arms I'm dying in, right?"

Yang Kai frowned—he truly couldn't understand how her mind worked to ask such a frivolous question.

This time he didn't evade her and instead spoke his true name.

An Ling'er pressed her lips into a bitter smile. "If we survive, will you come back to the Sacred Land with me?"

"Get lost!" Yang Kai replied curtly. "If you keep yammering I'll leave you here."

"You heartless, ungrateful creature!"

By then they had reached the barrier of the ancient ruins; Yang Kai charged straight through and the shield rippled but did not impede him in the slightest.

Inside the barrier, freed from the drag of seawater, Yang Kai's speed finally recovered; his Wind-and-Thunder Wings unleashed their forces, and he and An Ling'er shot toward the Void Passage they'd located like arrows from a bow, leaving overlapping afterimages so that countless silhouettes of them seemed to streak forward.

Not ten breaths after they burst through the barrier, Saintess Nan charged in as well; with a graceful flick of her body she was already some distance away — her speed was at least on par with Yang Kai's, if not faster.

Beneath her terrifying majesty, Yang Kai could only flee—he had no intention of fighting her.

As they pressed on, the Yang-attributed energy emanating from the Void Passage grew ever denser, indicating they were drawing nearer to its location.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and refused to relax for even an instant.

Suddenly a burst of True Yuan erupted from behind; Yang Kai's face changed—Saintess Nan had launched another move—and he immediately became hypervigilant, watching for any motion.

Ahead, a strange, netlike formation appeared and descended like a canopy.

"Luo Tian Net!" An Ling'er cried. "Get away—if you touch it, even your soul won't escape."

No reminder was needed; although Yang Kai didn't fully know the technique's specifics, his combat experience told him to angle away and slip out of the net's coverage.

Before that move could strike, another world-shaking energy fluctuation came from behind.

In the sky a jade-like hand, magnified innumerable times, slowly came down to clap; the giant palm filled Yang Kai's vision, giving him the illusion the entire heavens had been covered.

Nowhere to run, nowhere to dodge—darkness swallowed the light.

"Sky-Covering Palm!" An Ling'er murmured, her face ashen; a faint, bitter smile crossed her lips as her eyes slowly closed—she seemed to accept that this time there was no escape and that they would die here.

"Enter Demonic State!" Yang Kai's low murmur suddenly rang out; in the next moment the world trembled as a furious, violent demonic qi erupted from his body, the qi forming Demon Marks that imprinted into his flesh and then vanished.

His qi and blood surged powerfully and his aura shot up in a frenzy.

An Ling'er abruptly opened her eyes; her trembling form stared foolishly at the man who still held her close, disbelief lighting her beautiful eyes.

At that instant she sensed Yang Kai had become another person—filled with an evil, bloodthirsty ferocity, yet somehow more reliable than before.

That towering body stood like a majestic mountain, immovable through wind and rain.

That mountain-sized presence broke through the Sky-Covering Palm's oppressive seal and, before the destructive blow landed, carved out the only sliver of life—a strand of light.

Boom...

In the ancient ruins countless buildings collapsed; visible shockwaves radiated from Yang Kai's position, surging outward past the ruins' edge and whipping the seawater into violent undercurrents.

Yang Kai emitted a muffled groan, his face pale.

An Ling'er also felt dampness on her face; wiping it, she found it was the blood dripping from the corner of Yang Kai's mouth.

He had clearly not completely avoided the Sky-Covering Palm, yet he still stood upright.

"Damn!" Yang Kai cursed under his breath as he fled, glancing down at his abdomen.

Following his gaze, An Ling'er peered and then covered her mouth with a hand, crying out, "Heaven-Slaying Spear!"

Embedded in Yang Kai's abdomen was a radiant divine spear he had not noticed—a maneuver of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique; in the chaos neither An Ling'er nor Yang Kai had seen it coming, and his body had been pierced through.

Blood stained his clothes, and upon closer inspection faint golden light shimmered.

An Ling'er suddenly burst into bitter sobs, convinced there was no hope this time.

She knew the power of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique better than anyone, and since Saintess Nan had unleashed it without restraint, even someone as exceptional as Yang Kai, pierced like this, likely had his organs pulverized—death was not far off.

That he still ran and had not fallen suggested he had a final breath remaining; thinking this filled An Ling'er with overwhelming guilt and sorrow.
