## Chapter 1863 — How Many Void King Pills?

"What? Void King Pill?"

"No way?"

"Could it be? This Lord actually has a Void King Pill?"

The moment Li Nuo finished speaking, the hall erupted into a buzz; the martial artists all craned their necks toward the stage as if trying to peer through the jade bottle and see whether it truly contained a Void King Pill.

Li Nuo knew words alone would not convince them, so she quickly opened the jade bottle, and a plump, round pill rolled out from inside.

In an instant, the fragrance spread.

When that first Void King Pill had been taken out earlier, everyone had already caught a whiff of that distinctive pill scent; smelling it again now immediately confirmed without doubt that this was indeed a Void King Pill, because the two rounds of aroma were virtually identical.

If there was any difference at all, it was that this time the aroma seemed somewhat richer.

"Look, look, this Void King Pill is about a size larger than the previous one — could its quality be better?"

"What a joke; the quality of a Spiritual Pill is not judged by size. Yet… judging by its color and plumpness, it does seem a notch above the last one."

"Isn’t that the same thing?"

"Um… sort of."

The crowd below clamored nonstop. In Room A-2, Zi Wuji’s eyes nearly popped from his sockets as he stared fixedly at the Void King Pill on the stage, feeling almost as if he would burst out laughing.

The Void King Pill auctioned earlier had been forcefully taken by Gongsun Liang; Zi Wuji had been helpless and furious. Just when he thought he had missed his chance, Yang Kai had produced another Void King Pill — and its quality was even better than the previous one.

How could Zi Wuji not be thrilled?

No matter what, he had to find a way to put this pill in his pocket; with this Spiritual Pill’s aid and after preparing for some days, he could attempt to breakthrough to the Void King Realm!

If he succeeded, he would truly have the capital to compete with Gongsun Liang!

"How much does this Spiritual Pill of mine fetch?" Yang Kai’s voice drifted from his private room.

Li Nuo’s eyes flicked, and she smiled lightly. "Because the previous Void King Pill sold for one billion, in my view this Void King Pill is worth the same amount!"

She was clearly assisting Yang Kai.

A shadow passed across Gongsun Liang’s face as he coldly said, "Miss Li Nuo, think carefully. Just because I was willing to pay one billion for a Void King Pill doesn’t mean it’s truly worth that. If you set it at one billion, I will not agree."

Li Nuo’s brow pinched; before she could reply, Zi Wuji’s voice suddenly sounded: "Great Elder need not worry. I will pay one billion for this Spiritual Pill."

He lacked one billion Saint Crystals in person, yet with his standing, a simple written guarantee for Li Nuo would carry unquestionable weight.

Li Nuo nodded slightly, smiling faintly as she looked toward Gongsun Liang and said, "In that case, Great Elder, do you still have any objections?"

"Hmph." Gongsun Liang snorted coldly and fell silent for a moment before saying in a low voice, "One billion one hundred million!"

"Please have the Great Elder present the corresponding Saint Crystals or items on the stage as proof of fairness!" Zi Wuji cried loudly, refusing to relent.

Gongsun Liang did not reply. After a moment, a spatial ring flew out from Room A-1 and shot straight onto the stage.

Li Nuo reached out and caught it, her face grave as she began to inspect it.

Zi Wuji chuckled, "Miss Li Nuo, look carefully — such a large sum cannot be counted in a flash."

At his words many people looked thoughtful; indeed, how could such a vast amount be counted instantly? But when Li Nuo had just gone to Room A-1 to count the Saint Crystals, she had determined the amount in an instant — was there some trick?

Could the Great Elder really not have paid those Saint Crystals? If so, that would be too much of an affront.

This time Li Nuo counted for a long while; after the length of a joss stick’s burn, she finally smiled and said, "The quantity is confirmed — it is indeed one billion one hundred million Saint Crystals without doubt!"

"Great Elder, you are indeed formidable; I admire you!" Yang Kai said cheerfully.

"If you have no ability to raise the price, then this auction item will be mine," Gongsun Liang replied lightly.

Yang Kai chuckled and flicked his hand; a streak of light shot from his private room and floated down to land lightly in front of Li Nuo.

It was another jade bottle!

"Another Spiritual Pill?"

"Could it still be a Void King Pill?"

"It can’t be. A Void King Pill requires a Void King-Grade alchemist to refine and the main materials are exceedingly rare — for one to appear at all is already a marvel. How could they show up one after another at an auction? That jade bottle must contain some other kind of Spiritual Pill."

"Reasonable enough, but this Lord’s background is extraordinary; whatever he brings out this time should still be worth no less than a Void King Pill."

The crowd jabbered, all curious about what kind of Spiritual Pill Yang Kai had produced this time.

Li Nuo opened the jade bottle and glanced inside with suspicion; she trembled, her face showing horror, and then looked up: "Void King Pill!"

"Ah? Really? It really is a Void King Pill?"

"Exactly how many Void King Pills does this Lord have in his possession?"

"My Lord, may I follow you? I am a martial artist at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — if you accept me I will follow your side like cattle and horses with no complaints."

"Pah! Fourth Brother Chen, with your level you dare dream of following this Lord? I think you want the Void King Pill for yourself. With your talent, even with a Void King Pill you couldn’t reach the Void King Realm; don’t waste a Spiritual Pill. Lord, look at my qualifications — I am at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, my Saint Yuan is solid and my Shi is about to mature. Lord, let me serve at your side."

"Second Brother Sun, you dare embarrass Chen — I’ll fight you for it!"

"You two fools — how could this Lord look at either of you? Lord, I possess a special constitution; though not the legendary Wonderful Furnace Body, I have something similar. Lord, won’t you try? I am only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm now, but I will reach the Void King Realm sooner or later. If you accept me, I will be your slave!"

“You cheap slut who’s been crushed under a thousand men and ridden by ten thousand—how dare you show your face out here? Don’t you feel any shame? Lord, choose me instead. I’ve never even been touched by a man—my body’s still clean.”

“I know all the arts of the bedchamber—Lord, I guarantee I can pleasure you so much you won’t want to leave.”

The entire auction hall instantly turned into a noisy marketplace; countless Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm martial artists clamored toward where Room A-5 was located, showing themselves off, and some women shamelessly spoke words of temptation.

Yang Kai had produced two Void King Pills at once, which showed his wealth; anyone could see that if he could produce two, he very likely had more. A Void King Pill was a fatal temptation to anyone at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; if one could follow Yang Kai and obtain a Void King Pill, being treated like a beast of burden would be worth it.

In the private room, Hua Youmeng’s face went ashen as she watched the motley crowd below preen and pose, her nostrils quivering in anger.

Yet her eyes shone when she looked at Yang Kai; after all, she was also at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

On the stage, Li Nuo looked bitterly at the farce below, not knowing what to do; she had overseen many auctions but had never seen one like this.

Her spotlight had been stolen by a bidder, and though she bore no grudge, she felt… strange.

At the crucial moment Yang Kai cleared his throat and said lightly, "I appreciate everyone’s goodwill, but this Lord has no intention of recruiting followers. Moreover, Void King Pills are rare and came to me by chance — I only have two and no more."

He truly only had two; he had refined them casually while on the Floating Continent and intended to use them at the critical moment of his own ascension to the Void King Realm, but when the time came his ascent went smoothly and he no longer needed to rely on the pills’ effects.

As soon as Yang Kai finished speaking, many martial artists showed disappointment; except for a few whose eyes glittered, most sat back down and ceased their pestering.

Yang Kai then asked toward where Li Nuo was standing, "What is the value of this Void King Pill?"

Li Nuo replied without hesitation, "Since that other Void King Pill was worth one billion, this one is valued the same."

Gongsun Liang angrily said, "Can you find another person willing to pay one billion to buy it?"

A conflicted look flickered across Li Nuo’s features.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Miss Li Nuo, do not be troubled — let us estimate it at five hundred million instead."

Li Nuo showed gratitude and nodded, "If you say so, then five hundred million it is. Does the Great Elder still have any objection?"

Gongsun Liang snorted coldly and said nothing.

Everyone understood the value of a Void King Pill; five to six hundred million was normal, and crowds would scramble for it. Estimating it at five hundred million was already cheap; Yang Kai’s generosity made Gongsun Liang seem petty.

Li Nuo smiled slightly. "The bidder in Room A-5 has offered one billion five hundred million — Great Elder, do you wish to raise the price?"

In Room A-1, Gongsun Liang’s eyes showed a hint of struggle.

Jiang Changfeng asked from beside him, "Great Elder, what is so special about this item that you would spend so much to bid against him?"

Gongsun Liang sneered as he looked at him, "Nothing special, just pride."

“Uh…” Jiang Changfeng broke into a cold sweat. To think their bidding war had already climbed into billions of Saint Crystals—these two were truly something else. After a moment of hesitation, he spoke up: “If that’s the case, Great Elder, there’s no need for you to vie with him any further. This is Purple Star—surely you don’t fear him here?”

A cold light flashed in Gongsun Liang’s eyes; after a long moment he nodded, "Enough, let this be the end of it."

Although he still had the means to continue bidding, from Yang Kai’s manner he could not be sure he would win; as Jiang Changfeng had said, this was Purple Star and he had no one to fear here — letting the man possess it for a while was no great harm.

Saying that, his figure shimmered and he vanished from his private room.
