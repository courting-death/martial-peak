## Chapter 1982 — Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art

Inside the Danqi Pavilion, Zhuo Ningsi's pretty face darkened as she looked at the warrior before her, a man at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, and asked in a low voice, “How is that possible? Old Kang actually brought out more than thirty bottles of Origin Condensing Pill? Are you sure you didn't see wrong?”

The short, stout warrior nodded when he heard this and said, “I would not be mistaken, Mistress. Those more-than-thirty bottles were all Origin Condensing Pills. The moment they appeared they were snatched up by many people. I myself had to strain like nine oxen and two tigers to secure three pills.”

As he spoke he respectfully set a jade vial containing the three Spiritual Pills down before Zhuo Ningsi.

Because the Origin Condensing Pills sold by the Spiritual Pill shop were so popular, Kang Siran had stipulated that any customer could buy at most three pills at a time.

Three Origin Condensing Pills were enough for a Void King Realm practitioner to use for ten days or half a month. Once they were used up one could buy more; the Spiritual Pill shop would inevitably produce a new batch just in time.

This sales method was one of the key reasons the Spiritual Pill shop's Origin Condensing Pill was so hotly sought after.

Because supplies of Origin Condensing Pills were tight, the black market in Fenglin City had also begun to show signs of these Spiritual Pills; although they cost about twenty percent more than the shop price, demand still far outstripped supply.

Many Void King Realm practitioners didn't care about that extra twenty percent; they only wanted to convert their Saint Yuan into Origin Qi as quickly as possible.

“They're really Origin Condensing Pills?” Zhuo Ningsi dumped the three Spiritual Pills out and frowned more deeply.

“Boss, could these pills have been refined by that fellow Yang?” the short, stout warrior asked.

Zhuo Ningsi snorted and gave a cold hum, “Do you think he could refine so many Spiritual Pills alone in ten days? What level of alchemist do you take him for? Even a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist couldn't pull that off!”

“You're right, Mistress. It was my dullness.” The short, stout warrior admitted it made sense; though he knew little about alchemy, he understood how arduous a single furnace of Spiritual Pills could be and how taxing it was on an alchemist.

For one person to produce over three hundred Spiritual Pills in ten days, even given enough time, it was impossible to have that kind of stamina; the notion was laughable.

“Looks like Old Kang still has some stock,” Zhuo Ningsi mused. “That old fox truly isn't someone to be trifled with.”

“What can we do? I heard the Commerce Guild will send two alchemists to Fenglin City in two months. If we can't take over the Spiritual Pill shop within two months, our chance will be gone.”

Zhuo Ningsi lightly nodded when she heard this. A cold murderous glint flashed in her star-bright eyes.

The murderous intent blossomed slightly, making the short, stout warrior shiver involuntarily.

“You go. Keep a close watch on the Spiritual Pill shop and report to me immediately if anything stirs,” Zhuo Ningsi waved her hand.

“Understood.”

After the short, stout warrior left, Zhuo Ningsi looked puzzled as she picked up one of the Origin Condensing Pills again, held it beneath her nostrils to sniff, then examined it carefully and murmured, “Strange, this pill doesn't seem to have been stored long; it looks freshly refined…”

She had noticed this before. Although Zhuo Ningsi wasn't an alchemist herself, she dealt with Spiritual Pills for years and had a keen eye.

The three Spiritual Pills before her were glossy and round, plump and full, their fragrance pure—clearly top-quality. What concerned Zhuo Ningsi most was that these Spiritual Pills seemed just out of the furnace.

Could they have been made by that alchemist surnamed Yang?

The thought arose but Zhuo Ningsi quickly dismissed it.

No matter what, she was unwilling and dared not believe that a single person could refine so many Spiritual Pills in such a short time; she preferred to believe Old Kang had prepared stockpiles and had only thrown them out now.

After a moment's thought, she extended her slender, jade-like fingers, pinched up a Spiritual Pill and slipped it into her mouth, swallowing it. She then circulated her mysterious cultivation technique to temper and resolve the pill's medicinal potency.

She herself had reached the pinnacle of the Void King Realm and had already fully converted her internal power into Origin Qi, so she did not need Origin Condensing Pills; she only tested the pill's effect out of curiosity.

At first there was no visible change in Zhuo Ningsi's expression, but as time passed and the surging medicinal potency flowed through her limbs and bones she could not help but alter her expression; she opened her beautiful eyes and cried out in astonishment, “This is…”

She discovered the medicinal potency contained within that Origin Condensing Pill was actually somewhat stronger than the Origin Condensing Pills the Spiritual Pill shop had sold previously.

Although the increase was subtle and barely noticeable, it was indeed there.

“That old Kang, that damned fellow—did he again seek out a master to alter the formula?” Zhuo Ningsi immediately thought of that possibility.

The Origin Condensing Pill formula of the Spiritual Pill shop was something Zhuo Ningsi had long envied; it was the main reason she'd paid heavily to poach three alchemists from her rival.

Those three alchemists would not leak their formulas for various reasons; but it was no problem to have them refine pills if given materials. If she had managed to steal them, the Danqi Pavilion could sell Spiritual Pills matching the shop's quality, and the shop's sole advantage would vanish, making suppression far easier.

But today's discovery made Zhuo Ningsi furious.

Old Kang truly was crafty; he must have known of her designs and thus altered the formula so the Origin Condensing Pills were more effective.

That way, the Spiritual Pill shop still retained its potency advantage.

Zhuo Ningsi felt as if her lungs would explode with rage—what had been the point of her spending so much to recruit those three alchemists?

“Kang Siran, you wretch, just wait—soon the Star God Palace's envoy will come to Fenglin City; we'll see how you contend with me then!” Zhuo Ningsi seethed to herself.

Meanwhile, in the Spiritual Pill shop's underground refining chamber.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged, turning the experience of these past days of refining into insight, examining and consolidating each lesson.

Having refined so many furnaces of Origin Condensing Pill, he naturally had gains; these gains were not only material savings of hundreds of pills, but also increased alchemical experience and deeper comprehension of the Pill Dao.

Years ago, on Shuiyue Star he had triggered the Great Dao Pill Tone, which had bestowed upon him a unique advantage in the Pill Dao. The resonance that time fundamentally altered his alchemical talent.

Without false modesty, Yang Kai's aptitude for alchemy now was in no way inferior to Xia Ningshang, that Medicinal Spirit Saint Body, and in some respects even surpassed hers.

For that reason, when he received the new formula he could pick it up so easily, and could refine even better Spiritual Pills.

Zhuo Ningsi was mistaken — the Spiritual Pill shop’s Origin Condensing Pill formula hadn’t been altered. It was simply that Yang Kai himself had handled the refining; his craftsmanship made the medicinal liquid far purer, so the pills that came out of his cauldron naturally had a slightly stronger potency.

And this was only the beginning. As Yang Kai continued refining, the potency of the pills coming out of the furnace would grow ever stronger and eventually become distinctive.

Kang Siran sent for another hundred batches of materials for the Origin Condensing Pill, but he also urged Yang Kai to rest a few days before lighting the furnace again.

He cared more for Yang Kai's physical condition than Yang Kai himself did!

At present the Spiritual Pill shop only had one alchemist on duty—Yang Kai—and he was worth three men, so Kang Siran dared not be negligent; ever since that day he took more than three hundred Origin Condensing Pills, his attitude toward Yang Kai had grown increasingly amiable, almost obliging whatever he asked.

That said, Yang Kai didn't seem to ask for much.

At this moment Yang Kai harvested the insights from these days of refining while taking Origin Condensing Pills and converting his internal power.

A few hurried days passed and Yang Kai lit the furnace again.

The hundred batches of materials were sorted and categorized; Yang Kai's expression was solemn as Divine Sense Fire danced in the Purple Void Cauldron. One by one the herbs were cast in; under the power of his Divine Sense impurities were removed, the medicinal liquid condensed, talismans were inscribed, and formations flickered into being and vanished within the cauldron.

Yang Kai's movements were seasoned and supremely skillful, without a hint of slowness. His control of fire was such that even an Imperial-Grade alchemist would praise it; the timing of material insertion was flawless down to the smallest fraction.

The change in his innate talent had made alchemy far easier for Yang Kai.

For Yang Kai, refining pills was almost like eating and drinking—an instinct. He knew precisely when to inscribe which formation, which formation produced the best effect, what fire was needed at which moment, and when to add which ingredient.

Once refining became instinct, failure was almost unthinkable.

Coupled with the powerful Divine Sense Fire—an advantage every alchemist dreamed of—Yang Kai had already pulled ahead of many.

Yet despite this, he had never poured much effort into it.

The Dao was inscrutable and without trace; only a very few lucky ones could reach out and touch it.

Yang Kai was undoubtedly one of them.

The fragrance of the pills began to waft and Yang Kai grew even more focused; he did not become complacent from his familiarity but instead grew more cautious.

Within the Purple Void Cauldron the various medicinal liquids mixed and, under the formations and the Divine Sense Fire, transformed in wondrous ways.

When the pill scent condensed to a certain degree, Yang Kai suddenly moved.

His hands continuously made subtle seals; rays of profound light shot toward the Purple Void Cauldron and disappeared into it.

An ancient, desolate feeling spread out, as if this set of hand seals did not belong to the present age but to a very ancient antiquity.

Yet this technique coincided with the Dao and contained innumerable arcane mysteries.

As he executed the hand seals, Yang Kai's internal power and Divine Sense poured out like floodwaters from a burst dam, draining away uncontrollably.

Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art!

This was an exceedingly profound pill-gathering formula; it had no cultivation utility and could only be used when an alchemist was gathering a pill.

There were countless pill-gathering techniques and formulas in the world, each with its merits. Master Zuo De, who had once competed with Yang Kai in Shuitian City, had created the Red Lotus Miraculous-Hand Technique, which had been sought after by countless alchemists in his native Star Domain.

The True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy also contained pill-gathering formulas, which Yang Kai had studied in some depth.

But this Nine Heavens Profound Pill Art did not come from the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy; it was transmitted by the infusion of the Great Dao Pill Tone.
