## Chapter 1189 — Soul Cleansing Divine Water

With a crackling burst, a pitch-black orb of lightning formed on the horn of the second enraged Silver-Horn Electric Python, and when the serpent whipped its head that black lightning ball shot straight toward the two martial artists at incredible speed.

One of them turned pale and hurriedly dodged aside, while the other had most of his attention fixed on the fleeing Yang Kai — and thus failed to evade the lightning sphere in time, being instantly enveloped by it.

Sparks danced and crackled; the man convulsed, every hair standing on end, and in a panic he hurriedly circulated his Saint Yuan to resist the invading electric current.

But a colossal whip-shadow came crashing in from the front, tearing his soul and spirit asunder.

Shrouded by the current, his body went numb and he could not make an effective evasion; the whip-shadow struck him and he was hurled dozens of zhang backward.

A dense chorus of bones breaking rang out; a large area of his body caved in, blood gushed from his mouth, an abnormal flush spread across his face, and only then did he clearly see that what had struck him was not a whip at all but the tail of the Silver-Horn Electric Python!

When he hit the ground he twitched a few times, barely hauled himself upright, staggered and fell again, then lay motionless.

An Eighth-Tier demonic beast's lightning assault, coupled with a tail strike weighing over ten thousand jun, left this cultivator — a Second Stage of the Saint King Realm practitioner — struggling a moment and then dead.

The remaining cultivator's face changed drastically; he had never expected such an outcome. In his plan he intended to ambush Yang Kai, seize the Spatial Ring from Yang Kai's hand, and while the Silver-Horn Electric Python bothered Yang Kai he and his companion could withdraw easily with little danger.

But the facts deviated greatly from his calculations.

Yang Kai was unscathed, while his companion had suffered a sudden calamity and died on the spot.

Now he had no time to trouble Yang Kai, for like Yang Kai he had been entangled by one of the Silver-Horn Electric Pythons. A Second Stage of the Saint King Realm's cultivation against an Eighth-Tier demonic beast could barely preserve his life; he dared not linger. While striking he retreated, and soon led that Silver-Horn Electric Python away from Yang Kai's sight.

Yet before leaving, the resentful glare he threw made it plain to Yang Kai that this grudge had been placed upon him without justification.

The other had struck first, attempting murder and robbery, and now nursed hatred; Yang Kai would not let it drop. Moreover, letting them escape would surely cause trouble for him — once news of Cui Luo Grass spread out, it would inevitably draw attention.

This was no place for silencing witnesses — the Silver-Horned Thunder Python was far too troublesome. Yang Kai found that his Demonic Flame could barely harm it; the creature’s raised, hardened scales were impervious to both fire and water, looking almost like armor.

This was an Eighth-Tier peak demonic beast, nearly on the verge of evolving to the Ninth-Tier, about to transform from python into jiao.

Give it a decade or two and it would certainly succeed.

Moreover, this Silver-Horn Electric Python seemed mutated: not only could it employ thunder-type divine arts, cleaving off arm-thick bolts of lightning from its horn, it also spat out coils of emerald poisonous mist from its mouth, giving Yang Kai a severe headache.

Killing it would take a great deal of effort!

Yang Kai thought for a moment and abandoned the idea of slaying it — killing such a demonic beast would at best yield a single Eighth-Tier Inner Core and some forging materials, hardly worth the cost.

He was still in a hurry to silence the witnesses.

With that he deliberately withdrew from the fight and pursued in the direction the other cultivator had fled, and soon shook off the Silver-Horn Electric Python that had been tailing him.

Halfway along the way, he saw the other pursuing Silver-Horned Electric Python slithering its massive body back toward the earthen hole; Yang Kai immediately understood that the cultivator, like himself, had shaken off the troublesome opponent.

In a thicket, a Second Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivator sat with his back against a tree, his Divine Sense expanded as he gasped, wary of every sound around him while cursing under his breath.

He could have harvested over a dozen Cui Luo Grasses, but fate had not smiled upon him — not only did he fail to gather the herbs, his companion was dead.

He now bore Yang Kai's face in his heart with hatred, convinced his plight was entirely the other's fault; had that man not burst in and acted so rashly, how could he be so embarrassed?

A dozen Cui Luo Grass! That would have been a major merit; if safely delivered to the sect's elders it would have brought great reward — now there was nothing.

He would not let it rest; come what may he must snatch the Cui Luo Grass from that man's hands.

He fished a Transmission Compass from his Spatial Ring and poured in Divine Sense to inform his fellows of what had happened, when a sensation — cold and hot, righteous and wicked — suddenly descended from above.

He looked up bewildered and saw a gigantic pitch-black palm coming down hard toward him.

With a cry he triggered his defensive Secret Treasure and sprang outward, instantly covering more than ten zhang and narrowly avoiding the huge palm's strike.

Someone was ambushing him!

Terror chilled him; his Divine Sense spread but still could not detect the intruder's trace, indicating the opponent's realm was higher than his — but who would ambush him?

The next moment he realized: a black flame enveloped him and he stared at Yang Kai, who strolled over from not far off, and cried in horror, "It's you..."

Entwined in Demonic Flame, and lacking the Silver-Horn Electric Python's hardened hide, he could not resist the burning; in moments he turned to ash.

His Spatial Ring and a compass Secret Treasure tumbled to the ground.

Yang Kai let out a quiet breath of relief. Seeing the compass Secret Treasure, he knew his guess had been correct: the man had planned to contact his companions after shaking off the Silver-Horn Electric Python. Fortunately Yang Kai had arrived in time, or it would have been another mess.

Bending to retrieve the Spatial Ring and inspecting it, as expected it contained Saint Crystals and Pills. In addition there were several Saint King-Grade Upper-Level herbs and a few bean-sized Crystal Stones — apparently the spoils he had collected along the way.

Indifferently claiming the items as his own, Yang Kai also picked up the compass Secret Treasure.

Just as he was about to toss it into his Spatial Ring, a ripple of Divine Sense emanated from the compass Secret Treasure.

Someone was transmitting!

Yang Kai's heart jumped — had he arrived too late? Had the man already contacted others?

He frowned and probed the Divine Sense; after checking, his expression turned strange.

Indeed someone was transmitting, but not about the earlier incident — the man's companion was calling in reinforcements, apparently having discovered something extraordinary.

Yang Kai had no intention of involving himself; after all, he had just slain a man here, so there was no reason to interact with these people. But the Divine Sense transmissions mentioned the four characters "Soul Cleansing Divine Water"!

This greatly astonished Yang Kai.

Back when he studied many tomes at Zong Ao on Rainfall Star, he had read not only about herbs and pill recipes but many other hidden secrets.

Soul Cleansing Divine Water was one such thing.

Such a thing was not a natural treasure produced by the world, but something born of rare coincidences.

The birth of Soul Cleansing Divine Water required three conditions: first, the location's Spiritual Qi had to be absolutely dense — ideally on an Earth Vein or within a spiritual spring; second, a Void King Realm expert had to have died there; third, after that Void King Realm expert died, their Divine Sense power must not dissipate but instead perfectly merge with the Earth Vein or spring, producing an exceedingly slim chance to generate Soul Cleansing Divine Water.

Of those conditions the third was the hardest, for no matter how mighty a cultivator, once dead their spirit energy overflows the body and quickly disperses into heaven and earth — an inevitability none could avoid.

Yet there were exceptions.

For example, the Warm Spirit Lotus has the ability to preserve Divine Sense energy. When Yang Kai obtained a Warm Spirit Lotus, vast Divine Sense energy permeated its surroundings because the lotus itself preserved Divine Sense.

If Yang Kai had accidentally died while possessing it, his Divine Sense energy would not have dissipated but would have been preserved by the Warm Spirit Lotus.

The birth of Soul Cleansing Divine Water was one such exception.

A person's Divine Sense energy contains their life's experiences and memories; no one would dare casually devour them — Yang Kai himself would need to use his World-Ending Demon Eye to purify them before consuming.

Soul Cleansing Divine Water was different: it formed from the mingling of Divine Sense energy and vast Spiritual Qi under fortuitous conditions. It did not contain the deceased expert's memories and life experiences — such impurities had long since faded over countless years.

Soul Cleansing Divine Water could not only rapidly advance a cultivator's Divine Sense cultivation, but if one sat within it to meditate and luck smiled upon them, one might even comprehend the divine arts of the deceased Void King Realm expert.

Of course, that chance was even smaller than the already minute probability of Soul Cleansing Divine Water's formation.

Zong Ao's records noted these things, but Soul Cleansing Divine Water was exceedingly rare. A Void King Realm expert was the pinnacle of the Star Domain's practitioners with long life — how could they casually die, let alone on a place of concentrated Spiritual Qi?

Thus Zong Ao had only heard of it and never had the chance to witness one.

What startled Yang Kai was not that there might be Soul Cleansing Divine Water here, but that one of the conditions for its birth might have been met!

If this truly was Soul Cleansing Divine Water, did it mean a Void King Realm expert had once died on Dark Star? If such a Void King had existed before but not now, the generally low standard of alchemy and forging on Dark Star became another strange matter to ponder.

As he pondered, the compass Secret Treasure in his hand kept broadcasting Divine Sense messages; many people were asking in astonishment and rapidly assembling at a certain location.

Should he go see? Yang Kai frowned. If it truly was Soul Cleansing Divine Water, it would be worth inspecting; if not, there was little to lose — at most a waste of time.

With that thought he no longer hesitated. Quietly monitoring the transmissions within the compass Secret Treasure, he ran toward the location the warriors had mentioned.
