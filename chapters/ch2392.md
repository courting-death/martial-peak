## Chapter 2392 — You’ll Die a Miserable Death

That blood contained an extremely rich and fresh essence of Qi and blood, clearly just recently extracted, and it belonged to a martial artist who focused on tempering their physical body.

Other than being Man Kuai’s blood, there was no other explanation.

Half an hour ago, Man Kuai had just died, and now, half an hour later, his blood had ended up here, even forming a grand array that enveloped everyone. This was clearly premeditated, though no one knew what strange effect this array would have.

Only after the time it takes to drink a cup of tea did the blood finally stop flowing, as if it had been completely drained. The array on the ground was now fully activated by the blood, and a strange aura spread out, making everyone feel a chill.

Faintly, the sound of ghosts wailing and wolves howling could be heard.

Shen Fei and the others lay on the ground, quietly circulating their Origin Qi to neutralize the poison in their bodies, but whatever that poison was, the more they tried to dispel it, the weaker they became.

Suddenly, Snake Lady’s face turned pale as she cried out, “Man Kuai!”

Hearing her shout, Shen Fei quickly looked up, his eyes widening in shock. In the center of the array, a phantom had appeared. It looked exactly like Man Kuai, but it was completely lifeless, dazed, as if it had no consciousness at all.

Man Kuai’s Spirit Body!

That stone slab had not only absorbed all of Man Kuai’s Qi and blood essence, but even his Spirit Body was not spared. Judging by the state of Man Kuai’s Divine Soul, it had suffered tremendous damage; otherwise, it wouldn’t be so dull. Even without a physical body, a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert’s Divine Soul should be able to maintain its rationality.

“Sangde, what exactly are you trying to do!” Shen Fei gritted his teeth and shouted, unable to bear the unknown terror and oppression, his mental defenses on the verge of collapse.

Sangde snorted coldly, ignoring the question. Instead, he stomped the ground hard and said in a deep voice, “old ghost, it’s time to wake up!”

There’s someone else?

Shen Fei’s face turned pale as he quickly looked around. Snake Lady also glanced about in alarm, trying to figure out who this ‘old ghost’ Sangde was referring to.

In the next moment, both of their gazes turned in the same direction.

Over there, a vague, ethereal figure slowly appeared. Judging by its form, it was also a Spirit Body, but unlike Man Kuai, this Spirit Body was extremely weak, as if it could dissipate at any moment.

As the figure took shape, a chilling, sinister aura instantly filled the air.

Sangde grinned wickedly. “old ghost, I’ve brought you a few delicious morsels. Aren’t you going to thank me? I’ve treated you pretty well, haven’t I, Master?”

“What?” Shen Fei exclaimed, his mouth agape as he stared at the phantom in disbelief.

Snake Lady’s face also lost all color. “This person is your master?”

Sangde snorted, “You don’t need to worry about that. Just lie there quietly.”

As he spoke, he frowned and glanced at Yang Kai. For some reason, he felt Yang Kai was far too calm. Like Shen Fei and Snake Lady, he lay there motionless, but he didn’t say a word. Had he resigned himself to fate?

But things had come to this point. He couldn’t care about that anymore and just wanted to get it over with quickly.

“What did you mean by ‘morsels’ just now?” Shen Fei asked again, still uncertain.

As soon as he finished speaking, he understood. Sangde’s master, that ghostly figure, let out a piercing, grating shriek, then pounced on Man Kuai’s Spirit Body like a starving wolf, opening its bloody maw and biting off half of Man Kuai’s body in one gulp.

This ghostly being could actually devour Spirit Bodies! Such a thing was unheard of. Shen Fei and Snake Lady stared in horror at the gruesome scene, a chill running from head to toe.

Under their gaze, the phantom took less than ten breaths to completely devour Man Kuai’s Spirit Body.

Not only was it not satisfied, but its ferocity seemed even more aroused. Its once ethereal form became much more solid. It turned its head and glared viciously at Shen Fei, let out a shrill howl, and turned into a gust of cold wind, rushing straight at him.

“No, get away!” Shen Fei cried out in terror, struggling desperately.

But now he had no strength at all and couldn’t resist. The phantom flashed and disappeared, plunging into his body. Immediately, Shen Fei began to convulse, his eyes twitching, his face twisted in agony as if enduring unspeakable torment.

Snake Lady was already pale with fright. Seeing she was next, she quickly pleaded with Sangde, “Master, please spare me! I’ll serve you loyally as your slave, I promise I won’t disappoint you!”

As she spoke, she forced a pitiful smile, making a last-ditch effort to use her beauty to win a chance at survival.

Sangde ignored her, snorting coldly. “A pile of rotten meat that even stray dogs wouldn’t touch dares to show off in front of me.”

Snake Lady’s beautiful eyes dimmed, knowing she was truly doomed this time.

At that moment, Shen Fei suddenly died, and the phantom burst out of his body. After devouring the Spirit Bodies of two people in succession, the phantom had become extremely solid, and its eyes now showed a glimmer of intelligence.

Without pausing, it rushed into Snake Lady’s body and repeated the process.

Snake Lady screamed in agony, cursing Sangde to die a miserable death as she realized she was doomed, her curses unending.

Sangde snorted coldly, ignoring her, then turned to Yang Kai. “You don’t seem worried at all.”

Yang Kai grinned. “If I’m the fish and you’re the butcher, what’s the point of worrying?”

Sangde smirked. “You’re quite open-minded. I admire that.”

“Since you admire me, how about letting me go? We could be friends once we get out.” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Sangde’s face darkened. “Impossible! You’re the key to my deal with the old ghost. I can’t let you go, no matter what!”

“A deal?” Yang Kai caught the word, his eyes narrowing. “What deal?”

“That’s none of your business!”

Yang Kai curled his lip. “Come on, Master, that’s not fair. If I’m the key to your deal, how could it have nothing to do with me? I’m going to die anyway, so just tell me. It’s not like it’ll cost you anything!”

Sangde sneered. “If you behave and don’t resist, you’ll suffer less pain!”

With that, he ignored Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snorted, not pressing the issue, and instead looked at the Bihai Shuttle. “Master, you said that’s the tool to leave this secret realm. It’s not just a ruse, is it?”

This time, Sangde didn’t dodge the question. He replied in a low voice, “That Bihai Shuttle is no ruse—it’s the culmination of the old ghost’s life’s work, painstakingly refined for the sole purpose of escaping this place. With it, leaving this secret realm is entirely possible.”

“So that’s how it is,” Yang Kai murmured with a sigh, though it wasn’t clear exactly what he was sighing about.

By now, Snake Lady had also died. After the Yin-Soul devoured her Spirit Body, it had fully recovered. Its eyes moved nimbly, no longer dull or lifeless.

“You’ve recovered well,” Sangde said to the Yin-Soul, sneering.

The Yin-Soul replied, “It’s all thanks to having such a good disciple!”

“It’s only right to do these things for my master,” Sangde snorted.

The master and the disciple exchanged a few words with fake smiles, but there was no hint of real affection between them. Their eyes were full of murderous intent, as if they wished to kill each other. Who knew how things had come to this?

The Yin-Soul turned to Yang Kai. “Is this the body you found for me?”

Sangde said, “It took me a lot of effort to find him.”

The Yin-Soul frowned. “Is his soul strong enough? Don’t let him fail to withstand my possession!”

“I tested him myself. Even if he’s not as strong as me, he’s not far off. He’ll definitely be able to handle you.”

The Yin-Soul nodded. “That’s best.”

Yang Kai looked at the Yin-Soul with interest, suddenly understanding. “So you want to possess me?”

The Yin-Soul replied, “You already know! Hm, you’re an interesting one. You’re not afraid?”

Yang Kai chuckled. “I’m not the one who should be afraid. Let me give you a word of advice: don’t try to possess me, or you’ll die a miserable death!”

The Yin-Soul was clearly startled, then turned to Sangde. “Why did you find me a lunatic?”

Sangde snapped, “This brat just likes to talk big. Can’t you see that? You really are getting senile. The longer we wait, the more things can go wrong. Hurry up and do it!”

The Yin-Soul thought for a moment, then agreed. Its body twisted into a gust of cold wind and rushed at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai still wore a lazy smile. “You really will die a miserable death.”

The Yin-Soul ignored him and dove straight into Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

Inside the Sea of Consciousness, the Yin-Soul appeared, ready to find and devour Yang Kai’s Spirit Body as before. But suddenly, his vision blurred, and Yang Kai’s Spirit Body appeared before him, looking at him mockingly.

“What…” The Yin-Soul was startled—not by Yang Kai’s boldness, but by the scene before him.

He had never seen anyone’s Sea of Consciousness so vast and magnificent. The sea below was deep and pure, like a true boundless ocean, creating an overwhelming visual impact.

This Sea of Consciousness was simply not something a Dao Origin Realm martial artist could possess. Compared to the two people he had just devoured, their seas were like streams next to this ocean.

Traitor! In that instant, the Yin-Soul cursed Sangde viciously in his heart. He had tested him personally? Claimed this man’s soul was only a little weaker than his own? What a joke! This wasn’t just a small difference—Yang Kai’s soul was leagues above that unfilial disciple’s. No wonder Sangde’s judgment had been so far off.

This was simply the Sea of Consciousness of an Emperor Realm expert!

No matter how strong the Yin-Soul was, he knew he could never defeat Yang Kai here.

Realizing this, he tried to retreat as quickly as possible. He knew that if he was too slow, he might never escape.
