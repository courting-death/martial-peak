## Chapter 64 — Open Origin Realm

The Sect Leader smiled upon seeing Xia Ningshang so obedient and sensible. “Meng Wuya is truly fortunate to have taken such a good disciple.”

Recalling his own two disciples, the Sect Leader sighed deeply.

Xia Ningshang, evidently aware of his past, saw the shadow of melancholy in his expression. Unsure how to comfort him, she remained silent.

The Sect Leader silently raised his hand to shield the sky, then pushed it toward Yang Kai’s direction. In an instant, Xia Ningshang felt the world there being sealed off, as if an invisible giant hand was blocking any prying eyes.

“This young man’s breakthrough this time should have caused quite a stir. It’s better to prevent any unwanted investigations,” the Sect Leader explained.

Xia Ningshang felt a twinge of curiosity. She did not understand why this Sect Leader, who rarely appeared before others, cared so much about Yang Kai. Though puzzled, she dared not ask further.

The old and the young stood separated by a hundred zhang, watching Yang Kai’s situation.

The energy of heaven and earth poured into his body, tempering every inch of flesh and muscle. Though no fluctuation of Primordial Qi could be sensed, the wind howling within a dozen zhang around Yang Kai was visible proof of the commotion.

But why would a breakthrough to the Open Origin Realm cause such a disturbance? Xia Ningshang truly could not comprehend.

As time passed, Yang Kai’s body slowly swelled, as if inflated like a balloon. His once gaunt frame grew several sizes larger, a result of the overwhelming influx of heavenly energy.

Just as Xia Ningshang began to worry, his body suddenly contracted back to its original form. Even with the Sect Leader’s sealing technique in place, Xia Ningshang still sensed a pulse of terrifying Primordial Qi.

What was even more astonishing came next. After Yang Kai fully absorbed this heavenly energy, a stream of fiery red energy, visible to the naked eye, surged from within the Dragon Confinement Ravine before him.

This energy resembled red ribbons ascending from beneath the ravine, entering Yang Kai’s pores.

Yang Source Qi! Xia Ningshang understood clearly. Yang Kai’s first absorption was of the general heavenly energy, but the second was this Yang Source Qi. Though a form of heavenly energy, it was a singular attribute.

Only after all the Yang Source Qi was absorbed did the commotion suddenly subside.

“It’s done.” The Sect Leader smiled faintly, snapping his fingers to remove the seal. His figure flickered and vanished, a faint voice whispering in Xia Ningshang’s ear, “Give my regards to your master.”

“Yes!” Xia Ningshang replied respectfully, then turned to examine the results of Yang Kai’s breakthrough.

At a glance, she was stunned.

Open Origin Realm, Second Stage!

She almost thought her senses had deceived her, so she checked again. Indeed, Yang Kai had reached the Second Stage of the Open Origin Realm!

This breakthrough was not only a leap into a new great realm but also an additional small stage beyond it. Was she dreaming?

Xia Ningshang’s own constitution was special, and she had progressed rapidly since beginning cultivation. Yet every breakthrough had been steady and gradual; never had she leapt two stages at once. Witnessing Yang Kai’s feat firsthand, how could she not be astonished?

Just as she was marveling, Yang Kai, sitting cross-legged on the ground, muttered to himself, “So that’s how it is!”

With those words, the Primordial Qi around him thickened once more.

Open Origin Realm, Third Stage!

“Monster!” Xia Ningshang could only laugh and cry at once, feeling her confidence shaken for the first time.

After remaining there for another hour to ensure Yang Kai would not suddenly advance further, Xia Ningshang finally exhaled and quietly left.

Yang Kai sat by the Dragon Confinement Ravine all night, not practicing the True Yang Technique, but deeply contemplating the insights gained from his breakthrough.

During last night’s breakthrough, two types of energy had poured into his body. The first was the might of heaven and earth, which was not stored in his dantian but mostly absorbed by his bones, aside from some that tempered his body.

The second was the Yang Source Qi drawn from beneath the ravine. This energy became his own, crystallizing into five drops of Yang Essence quietly settling in his dantian.

After a night of reflection, Yang Kai finally grasped a rough understanding.

The Proud Bone Golden Body could enhance his combat power when injured or in pain, but this increase required energy support; it could not arise from nothing. Thus, its ability to absorb heavenly might was not difficult to explain.

This absorbed heavenly might would be returned to him when needed. This was the profound secret of the Proud Bone Golden Body and the fundamental reason it could boost his strength.

Yang Kai had always believed he could only absorb Yang attribute energy, since he cultivated the True Yang Technique. Now, this issue deserved testing.

If he could indeed absorb energies beyond the Yang attribute, his cultivation might accelerate greatly in the future.

This discovery brought him joy. Though the True Yang Technique was powerful, it had limitations. If his guess was correct, he would no longer be troubled by the environment needed for cultivation.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai stood and carefully sensed himself. He had indeed broken through, astonishingly leaping to the Third Stage of the Open Origin Realm.

Reflecting on the massive influx of two energies into his body last night, Yang Kai felt at ease.

The initial opening of Primordial Qi within the body marked the Open Origin Realm. Though he had already possessed considerable Primordial Qi, this breakthrough was still momentous.

The Primordial Qi formed a great cycle within him, bridging heaven and earth. The operation speed of the True Yang Technique increased significantly.

Moreover, reaching this realm made cultivation easier than at the Body Tempering Realm, provided one had a suitable environment.

Walking back from the Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Kai felt refreshed in body and spirit. A breakthrough of a great realm made the world appear different; his senses sharpened immensely.

Within fifty zhang, even a person’s breath could be faintly detected.

As he headed toward the wooden hut, Yang Kai suddenly heard a familiar cry of pain. Pausing to listen, he could not help but smile.

How was it that Su Mu was being beaten again?

However, since this was within the sect, if he was being struck, it must be a challenge match. If he was outmatched, then he deserved it.

With nothing pressing, Yang Kai decided to go see the commotion.

Within Lingxiao Pavilion, once a challenge began, anywhere could become a battlefield. The place where Su Mu was being beaten was not far; after a short walk, Yang Kai arrived.

A crowd had gathered, and Yang Kai’s gaze swept over them. He was shocked to see two clearly divided factions, the tension thick in the air. Familiar faces like Li Yuntian and Zhao Hu were among them, their expressions angry as they confronted the opposing group.

Something was wrong! Yang Kai frowned. Among sect disciples, no matter who won or lost in sparring, it would never escalate to such a state. Li Yuntian and the others clearly looked righteously indignant, ready for a brawl.
