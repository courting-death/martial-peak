## Chapter 1486 — Invitation

After hearing their self-introductions, Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and realized these people were not from the same faction; there was even a trace of competition between them.

This left Yang Kai somewhat at a loss; he did not know what they were after.

"It’s like this, friend." The one called Wu Chang seemed naturally sociable, his smile overly friendly—yet to Yang Kai, it felt false and insincere, stirring a faint dislike. “Seeing you come alone, could it be that you’re planning to venture deep into the Fallen Emperor Mountains to explore the cave dwellings of ancient cultivators?”

"Indeed!" Yang Kai nodded lightly. "And what of it?"

Wu Chang chuckled. "Friend need not be so wary. I mean no ill will; I merely wish to invite you to enter together with me."

"With you?" Yang Kai’s brow lifted.

"Exactly." Wu Chang hurriedly nodded, then pointed to one side. "You must have noticed, I am only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. That realm isn’t low, but it isn’t high either. The disciples of my Tianjue Sect are over there, and there is no Origin Returning Realm expert stationed to guard things; should we enter the Fallen Emperor Mountains and encounter a formidable enemy… heh…"

He didn’t finish, but Yang Kai had already guessed why he’d made the invitation. Following the direction of his finger, he saw a group of warriors dressed like Wu Chang gathered there, roughly a dozen or so in number, mostly cultivators of the Saint King Realm, with no trace of an Origin Returning Realm expert.

It appeared the Tianjue Sect’s strength was not particularly impressive.

"You want me to protect your safety?" Yang Kai asked.

"Speaking with a clever man is easy. Protection is one option; cooperation is another. It depends on whether you are willing." Wu Chang nodded earnestly.

"Is there a difference?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Naturally there is." Seeing Yang Kai seemed tempted, Wu Chang hurried to press the point. "If you protect my Tianjue Sect, we can give you a sum of goods to guarantee your satisfaction, but whatever is found inside the Fallen Emperor Mountains will belong to my Tianjue Sect and has nothing to do with you. If we cooperate, then both parties can discuss how to divide any findings. Of course, I would prefer cooperation."

Yang Kai nodded faintly. He at last understood why they were so affable: they were short on top experts. He had not concealed his cultivation; though they appeared to be Saint King Realm warriors, they could naturally tell he was an Origin Returning Realm.

"You’re the same?" Yang Kai glanced at the others.

The other warriors hurriedly nodded and each began to introduce their family or Sect.

"I understand." Yang Kai chuckled meaningfully, then asked with deep intent, "But aren’t you afraid I’ll betray you? If I find something valuable, won’t I kill you and take it?"

At those words, Wu Chang and the others’ faces stiffened, awkward and uneasy, yet Wu Chang quickly recovered and forced a laugh. "You jest, friend."

"Whether I jest or not, if I have the ability to explore the Fallen Emperor Mountains, why should I cooperate and let the gains be shared away?" Yang Kai scoffed. He wasn’t speaking to pass the time; he had just arrived and might glean useful information from people like Wu Chang who clearly knew something about the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

"Uh… friend, the ancient martial caverns inside the Fallen Emperor Mountains are exceedingly well hidden; many cannot even be discovered by Divine Sense. With more people the chance of finding them naturally increases. Moreover, the seals and defenses of those caverns are often not something a single person can break—cooperation is required—so cultivators who enter generally seek like-minded partners; those who go in alone are very rare."

"That does make some sense." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Wu Chang and the others were overjoyed, about to say more, when Yang Kai waved them off. "I’ve only just arrived and have no intention to go in for now. If I decide to, I’ll seek you out to cooperate."

With that, Yang Kai left directly.

He had never intended to cooperate with those people.

Although Wu Chang and the others were a bit unwilling, they couldn't easily continue to detain him. They could only keep watch of the surroundings to see if any other lone Origin Returning Realm would arrive.

Having shaken off those men, Yang Kai did not hurry into the Fallen Emperor Mountains. He lingered among the casually arranged stalls, and took out a Transmission Compass, pouring his Divine Sense into it.

After a moment of waiting the compass gave no response. Yang Kai shook his head and put it away.

It seemed Qian Tong was too far away from him, otherwise he should have been able to contact him.

He wasn’t inspecting the stalls to pick up treasures; although there were many and varied goods displayed, there was almost nothing to catch Yang Kai’s eye—who would put real treasures out on stalls? People guard their treasures jealously.

One could say the things on the stalls were common, everyday goods.

Of course, there are ignorant people who treat treasures like trash, but such luck is hard to come by.

Yang Kai remained primarily to gather intelligence; at the very least he could glean the general situation in the Fallen Emperor Mountains from the conversations around him.

Indeed, the noisy crowd let him overhear quite a bit of information.

The ruins of an ancient sect truly existed, and they lay in the very innermost part of the Fallen Emperor Mountains. Many powerful experts had already rushed there, but the Sect’s Protective Mountain Array was formidable; breaking it would not be easy. In the short term those experts were helpless and could only wait for more people to arrive to join forces.

If only Yang Yan were here—given her ability that Protective Mountain Array would be nothing—but sadly she had merged with the Great Emperor’s main body and remained in slumber.

Thinking of Yang Yan, Yang Kai sighed.

This woman was the most important friend Yang Kai had made since arriving on the Dark Star, accompanying him through wind and rain and sharing hardships and joys—he had not expected her origins to be so strange.

While immersed in memory, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with a keen light; without any trace he stepped away and walked toward a sparsely populated spot.

A moment later, he suddenly turned around, a faint, knowing smile playing on his lips as he said, “Friend, skulking behind me so sneakily—what is it you intend to do? Why not show yourself and meet face-to-face?”

A soft exclamation sounded, and then a figure strangely appeared not far ahead. He looked Yang Kai up and down and said in surprise, "You actually saw through Jiang’s movements."

Yang Kai snorted; his Divine Sense swept the man and revealed a cultivator at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, looking about fifty, gray-haired, small in stature, his Saint Yuan showing some peculiar traits.

Although the man’s cultivation was one stage higher than his, Yang Kai felt no fear.

He had slain several cultivators of the Third Stage; why be afraid of a Second Stage? Moreover, the other showed no obvious malice, so Yang Kai did not intend to act rashly before discerning his true purpose.

"Young brother, don’t take offense; Jiang means no harm." The cultivator surnamed Jiang hurried to explain. Skulking after someone was indeed a breach of etiquette; although Yang Kai’s cultivation seemed lower, this place was full of mixed characters and he did not want to provoke trouble.

"I noticed." Yang Kai smiled faintly without taking offense. "But speak plainly—why were you following me?"

"Heh, this old man was rude; here I apologize to Young brother. Since we are both Origin Returning Realm and strangers, I dare not be presumptuous. If you don’t mind, may this old man ask what attribute your Saint Yuan is?"

"Attribute?" Yang Kai frowned. "Why would I tell you that?"

"If convenient, please enlighten me. The old man is seeking companions who cultivate compatible attribute methods. If it’s inconvenient, forget I asked; Jiang will seek others." The Jiang cultivator’s expression was sincerely earnest.

Yang Kai frowned, pondered a moment, and said, "You look for yourself."

Saying that, he gestured and a jet-black Demonic Flame rolled in his hand, radiating scorching heat.

The Jiang-surnamed cultivator’s eyes lit up with delight. "Fire attribute—finally found one!"

"Hm?" Yang Kai’s brow knitted. "You’re seeking cultivators who have trained Saint Yuan of the fire attribute?"

"Exactly!" The Jiang cultivator’s expression grew eager. "I’ve already asked a dozen or so people, but not a single one fits my requirement. Young brother, if it’s convenient, could you move elsewhere so we can discuss in detail?"

Saying that, he looked at Yang Kai with pleading eyes.

Seeing Yang Kai hesitate, the Jiang cultivator bit his lip and quietly transmitted a message to him.

"Oh? Such a fortunate matter?" Yang Kai was greatly surprised and immediately nodded. "Very well, then Jiang, lead the way."

"This way, please!" Jiang was overjoyed at Yang Kai’s agreement and quickly led him off to one side.

Yang Kai followed, and the farther they went the more secluded it became, gradually leaving the crowds behind. He had great skill and a bold heart, and so he was not afraid the other might try any tricks.

Before long the two arrived at the foot of an earthen slope about ten li away, where three people were sitting cross-legged in meditation, seemingly recuperating.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept across the three and found they were all cultivators of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, their cultivations matching Jiang’s.

The three were two men and one woman. One resembled Jiang in age, appearing to be in his fifties or sixties, while the other man and the woman were considerably younger. The man had broad lips and a prominent nose, a wild, untamed air about him; the woman was small and exquisite, her curves alluring—her twin mounds high and firm, her waist slender and graceful, stirring imagination.
