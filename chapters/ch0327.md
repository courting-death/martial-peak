## Chapter 327 — What to Exchange

The cave seemed extraordinarily deep; Yang Kai had been falling for quite a while and had yet to reach the bottom.

After a bit more time, suddenly there were sounds of fighting coming from below, flashes of light appearing and disappearing before his eyes; it seemed that someone was releasing Martial Skills.

Yang Kai became more serious and on high alert. He understood that what Shan Qingluo had said was not false. Although the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave was exceedingly dangerous, there were people training inside at all times. He had only just entered when he unexpectedly encountered others.

In dangerous places, rewards were often plentiful. The peculiarities of the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave were enough to attract a multitude of people.

Moreover, right now, during the chaotic state of the world, many individuals were fighting outside. If it were during normal times, the number of people here would likely be even greater.

Where there were many people, there would also be disputes; fighting and bloodshed were age-old truths anywhere.

After a moment, the sounds of battle and flashes of light became clearer.

Yang Kai listened carefully and detected that there were likely four people involved, their strengths not very high—most of them were probably True Essence Realm martial artists.

As he continued down, he quietly released his Divine Sense to sense the surroundings. Waves of malevolent energy filled the range of his Divine Sense. These energies were varying in strength and gave an uncomfortable feeling; they should be the so-called evil spirits.

There were also auras of some martial artists, yet they were scattered and did not interfere with one another.

Though he hadn't perceived any imminent danger, Yang Kai quickly withdrew his Divine Sense.

Releasing one's Divine Sense was a very dangerous action; should he encounter an attack capable of harming it, he could suffer serious injury. Thus, not even experts in the Divine Roaming Realm would always keep their Divine Sense out, but only occasionally to explore their surroundings.

After what felt like an eternity, Yang Kai finally reached the bottom of the cave.

Not far ahead, four figures were engaged in a fierce battle. Various Martial Skills were being unleashed, with everyone cooperating seamlessly, retreating and advancing, trading blows without displaying the slightest bit of confusion.

What they were fighting against were entities that glimmered with a greenish light. These things appeared humanoid, with faint, grotesque facial features, yet their bodies felt both ethereal and corporeal, drifting in and out of reality.

With ferocious roars and chilling cries, sinister winds swept through the area. Although they were not overly powerful, they were incredibly difficult to kill.

These should be the evil spirits! It was indeed somewhat strange.

Yang Kai suddenly appeared behind them, but none of the four noticed, likely too focused on their battle.

To prevent any misunderstandings, Yang Kai deliberately made some noise.

All four were startled and hurriedly turned to look back.

In the next instant, one person silently jumped out of the fight. Facing Yang Kai, he guardedly stood on alert.

Yang Kai remained expressionless, displaying not the slightest hint of hostility, merely standing quietly, waiting for their battle to conclude.

After a moment, that person noticed Yang Kai's demeanor and couldn't help but grin at him, signaling goodwill.

Yang Kai gave a faint nod, ignoring him, and quietly examined the environment of the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

This underground space seemed to be an entirely different world. The whole area was hollow, with only an occasional stone pillar standing, rising to unknown heights.

The Evil Cave was barren, almost devoid of life; it inevitably gave an oppressive feeling, and the environment was quite complex, full of tangled roots.

Although deep underground, it was not dark here. All around were soft flickering lights that resembled fireflies yet felt like ghostly flames. The entire Cangyun Evil Land was illuminated like a Shura Hell, casting a terrifying veil over those within.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai had already formed some plans.

If only the Earth Demon were here right now, these greenish evil spirits would undoubtedly be a great supplement for him. Unfortunately, he must still be at the bottom of the Dragon Confinement Ravine, absorbing demonic energy, so he had missed this opportunity.

The martial artists before him, although one person remained vigilant of Yang Kai, had lost a fighting companion. The rest dared not hold back, unleashing their ferocious Martial Skills, quickly killing several of the green evil spirits.

Accompanied by a series of sharp screams, those green evil spirits suddenly scattered, dissipating into the air.

Only a few wisps that looked very clear yet still harbored some sinister power were left floating in the vicinity.

The essence of the evil spirits, Yang Kai’s thoughts stirred!

All the martial artists who came to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave sought this essence of the evil spirits, as absorbing and refining it could yield various benefits.

However, those green evil spirit essences appeared somewhat weak, lacking a rich concentration of energy.

Realizing this, Yang Kai shifted his gaze away.

The others glanced at Yang Kai and were satisfied with his calm demeanor. One man who appeared stable said to a nearby woman, “Rong Mei, put the items away.”

“Oh!” The girl nodded, then reached into her waist bag, pulling out a small flask. She pointed the flask at the several wisps of green evil spirit essence and lightly circulated her True Essence.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

The small flask, not very large, sucked all the wisps of evil spirit essence inside. The girl shook the flask happily, her beautiful eyes fixed on it with a look of satisfaction.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, curiously observing everything.

The man who had spoken earlier seemed to notice and couldn’t help but laugh heartily, fist cupping toward Yang Kai, “I am Tao Yang. May I ask how to address you, sir?”

“Yang Kai!”

“Ah, it’s brother Yang.” Tao Yang chuckled, his brows raised, and straightforwardly continued, “It seems brother Yang doesn’t quite understand this place.”

“Indeed.” Yang Kai nodded. Shan Qingluo had only informed him about the dangers and opportunities within the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, but she hadn’t mentioned anything about such flasks for collecting evil spirit essences, so he was quite interested in this.

“Is this your first visit?”

“First time.”

“No wonder.” Tao Yang appeared somewhat warm, at least not showing any malice nor using their numbers to suppress him.

Yang Kai felt he needed to reassess the martial artists of the Cangyun Evil Land! The world might bear heavy prejudices against the Cangyun Evil Land, leading to the belief that anyone living here must be of poor character.

Little did they know, both good and evil coexisted everywhere.

As Yang Kai and Tao Yang spoke, the three others beside them curiously observed Yang Kai, seeming to find his ignorance amusing; how could someone so oblivious dare to enter the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave alone?

They clearly didn’t know what "death" truly meant.

“What is this flask?” Yang Kai pointed at the flask in the girl’s hand and asked. Since Tao Yang displayed no malice, it seemed fine to inquire about it.

“This?” Tao Yang took the flask from the girl’s hand and shook it in front of Yang Kai. Inside were swirling green lights, rippling like flowing water. “This is the Purifying Spirit Flask, considered a kind of secret treasure, specifically crafted for martial artists training here.”

“What use does it have?”

Seeing that he truly knew nothing, Tao Yang couldn’t help but smile wryly, rubbing his forehead, and patiently explained, “Brother Yang, you know that evil spirits leave behind essence after being killed, right?”

“Mm.”

“This essence holds various wonders. After being absorbed and refined, it can provide benefits. But… this essence cannot be indiscriminately absorbed. It contains quite a lot of sinister power. Thus, martial artists must refine it, and the stronger the evil spirit, the more concentrated the sinister power left behind will be.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. He could also sense the sinister power within the evil spirit essence; it was pure poisonous energy that no one could tolerate. Absorbing too much would only lead to losing one’s sanity.

“Refining it takes time, right? In this Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, danger lurks everywhere. It’s not like one can just absorb and refine the essence on the spot every time they kill an evil spirit; that would be dangerously foolish.” Tao Yang chuckled lightly, “That’s where the Purifying Spirit Flask comes into play. It can hold the essence of the evil spirits inside. One can wait for a suitable opportunity and safe location to use the essence.”

“I see now!” Yang Kai suddenly comprehended; he hadn’t expected there would be so many intricacies. He had carelessly rushed in alone, realizing now that caution was necessary.

“Moreover, the Purifying Spirit Flask also purifies sinister power; the longer the essence is kept inside, the easier it will be for us to refine it. However, this may damage the flask, so it’s best not to keep it too long. Finding opportunities to refine early can also enhance strength, haha.”

“Thank you for the guidance!” Yang Kai solemnly cupped his fists.

“Brother Yang is too polite.” Tao Yang smiled faintly. After speaking, however, he furrowed his brows. His expression seemed somewhat conflicted and hesitant, but he quickly turned to the girl, “Junior Sister, pass me another flask.”

Upon hearing this, the girl pulled out another flask and handed it to Tao Yang.

Tao Yang tossed it to Yang Kai with a smile, “Brother Yang should also take one. Otherwise, being alone could become quite troublesome.”

“Senior Brother!” Seeing him so generous, directly giving a flask to a stranger, the other three couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise.

The Purifying Spirit Flask, while not a particularly high-grade treasure, was still quite troublesome to make. They had only brought three for this trip.

And now he was giving one away just like that?

“Since we are all here training, we should support each other.” Tao Yang shot a glance at the other three, signaling them to keep quiet.

Yang Kai reached out to take the Purifying Spirit Flask, but his brow furrowed slightly.

As the saying goes, no reward without effort. Although he hadn’t shown any malice toward Tao Yang’s group when he came down, they were still merely acquaintances—his generosity took Yang Kai by surprise.

This naturally led him to suspect whether they wanted something from him in exchange!

But since they didn’t know him well, why would they want his help?

Wanting to return the flask, Yang Kai hesitated again. After all, if someone offered him something, it might not be good to just return it directly. It could create the impression of him being rude, and one wrong move could lead to an aggressive response.

What could he possibly exchange for it? Yang Kai’s mind wandered.

His Divine Sense wandered inside the black book space; besides the Wan Yao Ling Ye, spirit milk, and spirit balm, there was also a Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng.

Additionally, there were treasures of various sects from overseas, and within him were also the Shura Sword and Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia.

These were all items he couldn’t give away.

Apart from that were some pills. These pills were prepared by Ling Taixu for him back then, and there were still two bottles of Heaven-Grade pills left over, which he had taken from Shan Qingluo’s Treasure Vault as a pretense.
