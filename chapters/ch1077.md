## Chapter 1077 — Bite Me, Then!

Within Xue Yue's Sea of Consciousness, waves of strange fluctuation emanated from Yang Kai's spirit body.

He began to construct scene after scene of phantasms, forcefully pouring those illusions into the sea.

From her infancy up to her present age, within those phantasms she needn't disguise herself, needn't always wear that unchanging, springlike smile, nor live life as a man.

She grew up carefree, with loving parents and harmonious siblings; she could wear the loveliest dresses and the finest jewelry, needn't study dull etiquette, nor cultivate day and night and endure all manners of torment.

In those phantasms she was the happiest woman under heaven, strolling the streets daily with a few maidservants; a single glimpse of her features could set a city's men roaring.

In the illusion, she returned home and told her parents about the little things she’d run into. They listened quietly with gentle smiles, the air filled with warmth and harmony.

She even met a man who made her heart flutter, yet out of shyness she could only watch from afar, following his movements each day, too bashful to speak first.

To her surprise, that handsome, graceful man sought her out, defeated every rival, met her father's harsh requirements, and brought her home as his wife.

They married and bore children; simple and unremarkable, yet they supported one another and treated each other with respect.

Their children gradually grew, they aged in turn, and finally became a handful of earth, their graves side by side as if never to be parted.

In those phantasms she obtained a perfect, regretless life.

Yang Kai, again and again, relentlessly poured these layers of illusions—constructed by his Divine Sense—into Xue Yue's Sea of Consciousness, heedless of the consumption of his Divine Sense or his own fatigue.

Time passed; Xue Yue's Sea of Consciousness remained as always, showing no sign of movement.

But at one moment the tranquil water suddenly churned; bubbles rose from beneath and burst into nothingness.

A breeze brushed by. A faint fragrance seemed to linger at Yang Kai's nostrils.

Yang Kai halted and turned his head to see Xue Yue standing behind him with a smile, watching him with great interest.

Yang Kai rolled his eyes and immediately withdrew from her Sea of Consciousness.

No sooner had he opened his eyes than Xue Yue also awoke, seized him, and cried, "Hey, why did you run off like a thief?"

"You're already awake—what am I doing still staying there? Waiting to be tormented? In there you are the master; I, a minor martial artist at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, dare not linger," Yang Kai snorted.

Each person's Sea of Consciousness is governed by themselves. So when two people are roughly equal in strength, they will never invade each other's Sea of Consciousness—such actions always end up harming the intruder. Only when there is a vast disparity in power does invading another's Sea make it possible to deal a crippling blow to the enemy.

"Torment you? Why would you think I'd torment you? If you haven't done anything wrong, why would I?" Xue Yue persisted, her beautiful eyes narrowed and flashing with light.

"Alright, alright. I admit I trespassed into your Sea and snooped on your secrets—that was wrong—but you wouldn't wake, so I had no choice," Yang Kai freed his hand from her small grasp.

"Snooped on my secrets—now you have the nerve?" Xue Yue ground her teeth, her white teeth flashing a dangerous glint.

"Didn't see much…" Yang Kai said awkwardly.

Xue Yue said nothing, merely fixed him with a stare.

“Fine, I’ve already counted every hair on your body—so what? Go on, bite me then!” Yang Kai said shamelessly.

"You bastard!" Xue Yue, furious and ashamed, lunged and bit the back of Yang Kai's hand, refusing to let go, rolling her eyes defiantly: "You think I don't dare?"

Yang Kai remained unperturbed and even chuckled, "Biting the hand isn't enough. Want to try somewhere else? I can give you a better spot to bite."

Xue Yue's face flushed scarlet; her long, fair neck took on a rosy glow. She quickly released his hand and spat, "In your dreams!"

In that phantasm she and the man she loved entwined without separation; every pose and position she could imagine and couldn't was seared into her mind.

She received systematic and complete education…

She, of course, knew what Yang Kai's words meant.

Although she understood it was only a phantasm Yang Kai had created and not real, she still found it hard to accept—after all, the woman in the illusion had been modeled on her, identical to her appearance.

It was as if she truly were a wanton woman, constantly demanding and never knowing satisfaction!

"How can you be so lewd?" Xue Yue regarded Yang Kai with a strange look, evidently not expecting him to be such a rogue, "I've misjudged you!"

"How is man-and-woman delight lewd?" Yang Kai sneered. "When you actually try it, you'll understand the exquisite pleasure."

"Even so, you didn't need to include yourself in those phantasms, right?" Xue Yue smiled coyly, as if she had discovered some secret. "You looked very handsome in those illusions—do you hope I'll truly marry you?"

"Spare me; I can't handle a woman like you," Yang Kai hurriedly waved his hand.

"Get out!" Xue Yue's temper flipped faster than a page; enraged, trembling with fury, she kicked Yang Kai off the bed.

Yang Kai rose, nonchalantly patted his backside, and said, "Rest for a while; when you recover I'll have something to tell you."

Xue Yue's expression stiffened; she seemed to understand what Yang Kai would say and closed her eyes without a word.

As he stepped out, Yang Kai happened upon Zong Ao standing to one side, leaning to listen intently; upon seeing Yang Kai he showed not a hint of embarrassment and instead asked, "Rescued her?"

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded.

"Impressive." Zong Ao couldn't help but give a thumbs-up. "But what were you two doing in there—seemed lively. Aren't you supposed to be her guard, kid? I have to say you're bold, even daring to touch the Young Master Xue Yue's woman. You should prepare to run; I hope you don't die too soon. If Xue Yue flies into a rage, the whole Hengluo Star Domain will shake three times."

Zong Ao, perhaps lonely for too long, though advanced in years, his appetite for gossip matched the young; he loved watching others flirt—every time it made him feel decades younger.

Shameless!

Yang Kai ignored him, went and found Halika, and told him the current situation.

When Halika heard Xue Yue had awakened he was overjoyed, hugged Yang Kai tightly, and was full of gratitude.

With Xue Yue awake their final worry vanished, and Zong Ao on Rainfall Star had advanced further along the Pill Refining path; now as long as the problem of the Profound Yin Moon Water was resolved, all would be well.

Moreover, since Xue Yue was taking responsibility for the Profound Yin Moon Water, even if the Commerce Guild tried to pin the blame on them, they would only suffer a light punishment — not nearly as severe as they had feared before.

The several officials were in high spirits and the entire branch was festive.

Time flowed by, and in the blink of an eye a month passed.

Since the day she awoke, Xue Yue had remained in her room and publicly claimed her injuries had not healed and she needed to recuperate.

Her wounds from the Profound Yin Moon Water had long been cured by the Leaving Flame Pill; her Divine Sense was undamaged—what need was there to recuperate? Though she had lain unconscious for over a year, with her cultivation she could recover in two or three days.

She was hiding from Yang Kai!

Yang Kai knew this but was helpless. Each time he went to see Xue Yue he was stopped by a few Saint King Realm warriors posted at the door as guards; they showed him no ill will but smiled and told him it was Lady Xue's order—without her permission no one may enter. Their attitudes were pleasant, but their refusal was resolute.

Yang Kai longed to give those men a good thrashing.

Yang Kai's displeasure dragged Elder Zong into the misfortune as well.

Not only had Yang Kai taken half the Profound Yin Moon Water, he had also taken half of the dozens of pill furnaces; Zong Ao winced at the loss but felt awkward to protest.

Zong Ao was a man of his word—if he lost, he accepted it. He was not like Xue Yue, who liked to bully others with her strength.

Yang Kai even specially asked about how to refine the Profound Yin Moon Water to augment his own strength.

Zong Ao did not conceal anything and explained everything he knew.

Yang Kai then realized that although Profound Yin Moon Water was a precious substance, if refined improperly it could kill. Refinement required many auxiliary materials and, above all, an intensely blazing environment.

Only by completing the preparatory work could refinement properly begin.

Surprisingly, Yang Kai possessed every one of the auxiliary materials—nothing was lacking.

On the Floating Continent he had harvested many high-grade medicinal materials, Origin-Grade and Void King-Grade in abundance, of numerous types; each item was of tremendous value.

All he needed was to find a suitable environment. According to Elder Zong, the interior of a ten-thousand-year volcano was best, for only such scorching heat could suppress the Profound Yin Moon Water's chill.

But Zong Ao warned that Yang Kai's current strength was still too low; refining Profound Yin Moon Water should be postponed until at least the Saint King Realm, otherwise failing could cost one their life and that would not be worth it.

Xue Yue's avoidance of him made Yang Kai impatient and angry.

One day when Yang Kai once again came to her door, the Saint King Realm experts dispatched to guard still stood smiling and courteously barred him, politely refusing him entry.

Yang Kai's face turned as cold and still as water.
