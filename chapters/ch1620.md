## Chapter 1620 — Stopped

“If it’s only those people trying to recruit him, Sect Master, there’s no need to worry so much. Such things are matters of mutual consent — even if they’re displeased, for the sake of their own reputations, they wouldn’t resort to anything foul.”

“It’s not just that,” Yang Kai shook his head. “Their attempts to recruit him don’t concern me — it’s something else I’m worried about.”

"What?" Lin Yurao asked.

“I’m afraid someone’s got their eyes on me,” Yang Kai said, the corner of his mouth twitching.

Various signs indicated that Luo Hai, the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, had some understanding of what had happened to him in the Blood Prison; the matter involved the Void Mind Crystal, and Yang Kai could not afford to be careless.

If the Void Mind Crystal were still in his possession, the issue would be easier—at worst he could hand the crystal over to Luo Hai and ensure everyone's safety—but the crystal was not with Yang Kai; he had already given it to Yu Xiong.

Having lost such a bargaining chip, how could he dare linger here?

If not for Qian Tong still needing a little more time, Yang Kai would have left at once.

Yang Kai did not go into detail, but from his tone and expression Yang Xiuzhu and the others inferred the matter was serious; they did not ask further and simply followed Yang Kai's decision.

Qian Tong remained standing in the distance, motionless, seemingly absorbing or contemplating something.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others, with nothing else to do, sat cross‑legged to digest the gains from this Blood Prison excursion.

Although they had not, like Qian Tong, risen to the Void King Realm, that did not mean they had gained nothing; on the contrary, each had reaped great benefits, and given sufficient opportunity in the future, none of them lacked the chance to attempt a push for the Void King Realm.

Yang Kai's expression flickered as myriad thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning, envisaging possible developments and countermeasures.

Time passed slowly; three days later, Zhao Tianze brought Qian Yue back.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Qian Yue was naturally overjoyed, but remembering that she had spent years on Cuiwei Star gathering leads yet discovered nothing about Su Yan and the others, her joy turned dim.

Zhao Tianze did not stay long; having delivered Qian Yue there, he hurried back to Lushui City.

When this Blood Prison opened, he had entered it together with Lushui City's deputy city lord; regrettably, that deputy—whose strength also reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—had perished within the Blood Prison and did not return alive.

It pained him deeply.

He needed to return to Lushui City and select a new deputy city lord.

Time flew by; five days later, Qian Tong's hearty laughter floated over the distance. Everyone waiting straightened and looked toward where Qian Tong stood.

In the blink of an eye Qian Tong appeared before them, a broad smile on his face.

"Congratulations to Elder Qian," Yang Xiuzhu cupped his fist in salute.

"Elder Qian's ascent to the Void King Realm is a rare event on our Dark Star that hasn't occurred in tens of thousands of years; the Yingyue Hall will surely be elated. All warriors of Dark Star share in this honor," Mo Yu chuckled.

"You're overstating it," Qian Tong shook his head. "This time I barely escaped death—if not for Yang Kai, I would have long since perished and could not have ascended."

Saying that, he looked at Yang Kai earnestly: "Yang Kai, I owe you another favor!"

If Yang Kai had not given him the contents of that jade vial to revive and strengthen his life and heal his wounds, how could he have endured until the end?

Qian Tong knew the thing Yang Kai had given him was Life Jade Nectar—he and Fei Zhi Tu had used it once before.

It was ranked alongside Soul Cleansing Divine Water and Immortal Source Liquid as one of the Three Divine Waters of the Star Domain; every drop was exceedingly precious.

The bottle Yang Kai gave him contained at least around twenty drops.

It could be said that his successful ascent owed largely to Yang Kai's merit.

“Elder Qian, you’re too polite,” Yang Kai chuckled. “Mm, this isn’t the right place to talk — we should leave at once.”

“Leave now?” Qian Tong raised a brow.

“Right now!”

"Very well!" Qian Tong said no more and continued to follow Yang Kai's lead.

"There are too many people to move easily—enter first!" Yang Kai said, casually producing the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Everyone knew what he intended; naturally they cooperated, relaxed their minds, and did not resist.

Yang Kai tossed the Xuan Realm Pearl toward them; a flash of light and they vanished from the spot, all absorbed into the Pearl.

"I won't go in," Qian Tong smiled slightly. "Having just broken through, I want to linger and feel this place's heavenly laws a bit more."

Hearing this, Yang Kai did not force him and nodded: "That's fine, but if you truly encounter danger..."

"I'm now a Void King—what danger could I meet?" Qian Tong laughed, not overly concerned.

A trace of worry crossed Yang Kai's brow; without further explanation he called to Qian Tong, and the two of them activated their Star Shuttles and sped out into the Starry Sky.

They were still above Cuiwei Star, and Yang Kai dared not casually reveal a warship; a Void King-grade warship's appearance would likely alert Luo Hai immediately.

The pair traveled at tremendous speed. Unlike Yang Kai's heavy concern, Qian Tong brimmed with confidence, as if everything now looked different to him; he scanned their surroundings as they flew, at times wearing a contemplative expression.

At the very moment they set off, a thousand li away in a city, within the lord's mansion Elder Jiu and other Void King Realm experts were chatting—sharing odd tales or exchanging cultivation experience.

They were gathered there because they were waiting for Qian Tong.

Qian Tong had just ascended to the Void King Realm. They assumed he would surely come seek them out — after all, every cultivator who broke through to the Void King Realm was bound to have many questions. With others willing to provide guidance, he naturally wouldn’t miss such a chance.

They did not expect Yang Kai to be so decisive as to leave Cuiwei Star outright.

Luo Hai sat at the head; when the mood struck he would say a few words that always left Elder Jiu and the others with looks of sudden understanding and great admiration.

After a while, Luo Hai frowned and showed a look of surprise.

"Lord Luo Hai, what is it?" Matron Lei asked, puzzled.

"I suddenly have matters to attend to—I'll go ahead!" Luo Hai said, and his figure faded in place then vanished; no one knew how he had departed.

"Where is Brother Luo Hai going?" Elder Jiu and the others exchanged bewildered looks.

"Judging by his expression, it seems something major has occurred—could his residence be in trouble?"

"Hardly; Luo Hai is the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star—who would dare act wantonly in his residence?"

"True, haha; perhaps I'm overthinking. But where is that newly promoted Void King? We've been waiting here several days—he wouldn't have run off, would he?"

"Why would he run? We bear him no ill will; we can freely impart experience—it's a good thing. As long as he's not a fool, he won't fail to appear."

"Then let's wait a little longer."

......

Above Cuiwei Star, at a height of one hundred thousand zhang, Yang Kai and Qian Tong raced side by side like bolts of wind and lightning, striving to break free from Cuiwei Star's control.

Suddenly, Qian Tong frowned and called lowly, "Yang Kai!"

"Sensing something?" Yang Kai turned to look at him.

"I have the sensation we're being watched!" Qian Tong frowned; his Divine Sense spread out like a tide yet detected nothing, leaving him thoroughly baffled.

He had only just broken through and was in a high-spirited phase of life; to suddenly feel like this naturally displeased him.

"Act as if you do not know!" Yang Kai transmitted by Divine Sense.

"Yang Kai, do you know something?" Qian Tong replied with his own Divine Sense.

"I have some suspicions!" Yang Kai's face darkened. "If I'm not mistaken, watching us is Luo Hai, the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star!"

"It's him!" Qian Tong's face changed drastically. "Why would he be watching us?"

"He's watching me!" Yang Kai forced a bitter smile. "He believes I carry something he needs."

"What should we do?" Qian Tong asked in alarm.

To be targeted by such an expert sent even Qian Tong into a panic. He was now a Void King, yes, but newly promoted; Luo Hai, however, was a Void King of the second Stage and the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star.

Qian Tong had no doubt that on Cuiwei Star, if Luo Hai decided to take his life, it would likely take only a single thought.

"Get away from this cursed place quickly. Once free of Cuiwei Star's heavenly-law constraints, Luo Hai is, after all, only a Void King of the second Stage; perhaps we'll still have a sliver of hope," Yang Kai reasoned clearly.

Hearing this, Qian Tong nodded ever so slightly.

Without Cuiwei Star's heavenly-law constraints, Luo Hai would not be as terrifying; perhaps they could truly shake him off.

At that thought, their speed suddenly increased.

“Trying to leave Cuiwei Star, are you?” In the distance, Luo Hai seemed to sense it and smiled faintly. “A fine idea… but far too naive.”

As he spoke, he reached out and lightly grasped forward; with that single motion, something seemed to change.

Yang Kai and Qian Tong, tens of thousands of li away, suddenly turned ashen; their lightning-like forms halted in mid‑void, sweat pouring from them, faces ashen.

Gazing into the endless Starry Sky, Yang Kai ground his teeth and desperately forced his Saint Yuan and Shi to break free of the invisible bonds, but to his horror he found he could not move no matter what.

The surrounding space seemed to have frozen.

The might of a Star Lord is so formidable!

So close!

Yang Kai could feel it—just a little more and he and Qian Tong would have escaped the constraints of Cuiwei Star's heavenly laws, but at that final moment they were stopped.

Qian Tong fared slightly better than Yang Kai; at least he could still operate his Saint Yuan, look around, and roar, "Who!"

A figure appeared soundlessly not far before them, crowned in gold and clad in golden robes—if not Luo Hai, then who?

He glanced coolly at Qian Tong, a trace of approval flashing in his eyes.

For a newly promoted Void King whose realm had yet to stabilize, achieving this was remarkable; given time, Qian Tong's achievements would not stop at the First Stage—he might even reach the Second.

Yet he did not linger on Qian Tong; withdrawing his gaze, he looked toward Yang Kai.

The main purpose of his coming was Yang Kai!

Previously on that wasteland, with so many eyes about, he could not act against Yang Kai; but now, with Yang Kai and Qian Tong flown out of Cuiwei Star into the Starry Sky, he could act without restraint.
