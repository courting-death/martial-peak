## Chapter 941 — Unbidden

Returning to Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai did not hurry to leave; he waited here as agreed.

Within a few days the Dong Family's direct members arrived.

A few days later, a parade of beauties from Wan Hua Palace arrived—larks and swallows, young and old alike—dazzling to behold.

A few days after that, people from the Baoqi Sect showed up…

Nearly every two or three days a new contingent would rush in from different directions to join the convoy bound for Tongxuan Continent. Yang Kai welcomed them all; as long as the newcomers were acquaintances or fellow disciples of his friends, he received them warmly.

This moved them greatly.

With the realm in chaos and Zhongdu fallen, news that someone had entered the Saint Realm spread like wings and soon traversed the entire Great Han.

When these sects found themselves at a loss, Yang Kai offered them a clear path.

So when the disciples stationed in Zhongdu sent word, there was no hesitation—people hurriedly packed and came to Lingxiao Pavilion to join Yang Kai.

The ranks swelled day by day; over a thousand gathered and then, like a snowball, grew—within ten days the numbers ballooned to four or five thousand.

While they waited, Yang Kai stayed busy—he had Li Rong, Han Fei, Shi Kun and the others instruct the newcomers in cultivation, while he gathered ingredients to refine pills; the medicines he made were properly distributed, doing everything possible to help them raise their strength.

Everyone was ecstatic; day and night countless martial artists sat before Li Rong, Han Fei, and Shi Kun like good students, drinking in their insights on the Dao of Heaven and the martial path.

The three Saint Realm experts who had followed Yang Kai lectured themselves hoarse each day, but looking into the eager eyes before them, they could not bear to ignore them.

Thus, they grit their teeth and taught the cultivation techniques.

Among them the Yang Family's blood servants and the Hu sisters showed the most striking growth; in barely ten days their True Yuan and cultivation levels underwent subtle but clear changes.

Bound by this world's restrictions, even those who broke through to the Transcendent Realm could not grasp much.

Yet under the slightest guidance from Li Rong and the others, they opened to understanding immediately.

Outside the crowd, Qiu Yimeng watched those Transcendent Realm cultivators with some envy. Examining her own level, she sighed softly.

These past few days, she had spoken much with Yang Kai, learning from his words of the many wonders of the Tongxuan Continent. She came to understand that in that world, reaching the Transcendent Realm was enough to be considered an expert—such a cultivation level already counted as stepping into alignment with that greater world.

By contrast, her peak Divine Roaming Realm here made her a strong expert, but there she would be nothing.

Divine Roaming Realm cultivators were as common as cattle over there.

Her heart grew anxious.

“Envious of their cultivation?” Yang Kai suddenly appeared beside her and asked softly.

“What's the use of envy? Talent is what it is.” Qiu Yimeng pursed her lips and smiled. “Besides, I'm a woman. I'll handle chores, raise children—this life will pass. Why would I need such high cultivation?”

“You're not the sort to be easily satisfied, are you?” Yang Kai turned his head and glanced at her.

Qiu Yimeng forced a smile. “I'm easily satisfied—it's just that you don't satisfy me.”

“Stop with the nonsense.” Yang Kai felt worn out.

Qiu Yimeng shot him a sulky look and, in a little woman's pout, relented: “Fine. I'm jealous of them. So what? Can't I be jealous if I'm not as strong? Especially those Hu sisters—do you know, they were once weaker than me, but after you left they inexplicably surged in strength and suddenly reached the Transcendent Realm. My eyes turned red with envy; look now, aren't they red?”

Saying that, she pressed herself against him, pinching the flesh at his waist and biting her lip: “Be honest—did you give them something good and not give me?”

“No way.” Yang Kai felt wronged. “Didn't I give you all the Wan Yao Ling Ye? Those elixirs should have improved your aptitude.”

“Then why are they so formidable?”

“They had their own opportunities.” Yang Kai didn't know how to explain it.

“What about your little brother-in-law?” Qiu Yimeng looked at him pitifully. “He surpassed them later, too!”

“He had his own chance…” Yang Kai mumbled.

Hearing her say this, Yang Kai suddenly realized: among the younger generation, only those who had benefited from the Inheritance Celestial Cave back then had risen; others, even Qiu Yimeng, had not reached Transcendent Realm.

This showed how enormous the benefits in the Inheritance Celestial Cave had been.

“I trust you!” Qiu Yimeng, seeing Yang Kai embarrassed, stopped pressing him and said proudly, “You always treat things fairly; I know you won't shortchange me.”

Yang Kai nodded hurriedly, and his spirit flickered over her; he smiled mysteriously: “When we get to Tongxuan Continent, I'll give you a surprise.”

“What surprise?” Qiu Yimeng's eyes brightened.

“You'll see when we get there. Don't ask now—just train properly.”

Qiu Yimeng sniffed. “Playing coy—what are you plotting?”

Yang Kai smiled wordlessly and put on an inscrutable air, making Qiu Yimeng itch with frustration but helpless to do anything.

Qiu Yimeng's greatest advantage was that she did not treat herself as an outsider; even though she and Yang Kai now differed greatly in strength and status, she still kept their former intimacy and did not deliberately distance herself.

This pleased Yang Kai greatly.

Huo Xingchen was the same.

By contrast, the four girls from Wan Hua Palace and Chen Xueshu and the others now felt restrained before Yang Kai, no longer speaking as freely as before.

The gap in strength and status made them wary.

As Yang Kai chatted happily with Qiu Yimeng, his expression suddenly changed and he lifted his head to stare at the distant sky.

“My lord!” Li Rong and Han Fei, who were lecturing over there, called out together in alarm.

“Damn!” Yang Kai swore, his face dark as the storm before a tempest.

He rarely cursed unless his emotions were extreme.

“What's wrong?” Qiu Yimeng asked anxiously; seeing his face change, she sensed danger and her face went pale.

“Listen—if you feel battle fluctuations from over there, immediately send people through the Void Passage; don't delay even for a moment!” Yang Kai urged urgently.

“What's happening?” Qiu Yimeng stomped in panic.

“Powerful enemies are coming, and several at once.” Yang Kai explained briefly, then signaled Li Rong and Han Fei that he would go to intercept.

He needed no investigation to identify the arrivals; from that overwhelming murderous fluctuation he smelled the presences of Demon General Meng Ge and Xueli.

A month ago he had driven them off outside Zhongdu, and Yang Kai had thought they would not return. Unexpectedly, after more than a month they had come back.

Moreover, this time there was the aura of another expert—deeper, farther-reaching, vast as the sea compared to Meng Ge and Xueli.

Another demon general?

Three demon generals—even if Li Rong and Han Fei combined, they could not quickly defeat them and could not look after the safety of the thousands gathered here.

Yang Kai decided at once not to let the enemy approach this place.

Before he could act, a voice boomed from the thick clouds: “I come unbidden; I have matters to consult with Saint Lord Yang, please do not take offense!”

The speaker was over a hundred li away, but the voice rang in Yang Kai's ear as if right beside him, clear as glass.

The thousands gathered all looked up; the once-bright sky was filling with ink-black clouds that blotted out the light, dense and suffocating above them.

Yang Kai's expression shifted and he froze.

Li Rong and Han Fei turned expectant gazes to him; Yang Kai slowly shook his head, signaling them to hold their ground.

The other party spoke before arriving, with a tone that seemed conciliatory; Yang Kai was baffled as to who they were and what they wanted.

On the horizon a black curtain swept over the heavens, rapidly approaching like a cataclysm, whitening faces with fear.

Yang Kai snorted coldly and barked, “Can you rid yourself of that murderous aura? You're frightening my friends.”

His words shot like an arrow, piercing the black clouds and tearing a huge hole through them; a shaft of sunlight pierced down and struck Lingxiao Pavilion directly.

The oppressive atmosphere paused, and everyone gasped as they inhaled freely.

Soon an apologetic voice came from that direction: “Sorry, I tend to be careless; I didn't expect so many people to be gathered here. Ah—Saint Lord Yang, please forgive me!”

As he spoke, the dark clouds seemed to be smoothed by an invisible hand and quickly dissolved.

The sky cleared once more.

Deep fear showed in Yang Kai's eyes, and even Li Rong's expression grew unusually grave.

They all sensed the newcomer's overwhelming might.

Soon three silhouettes abruptly appeared in the sky, hovering as if they had always been there.

The leader was a plain-looking middle-aged man wearing an ostentatious cloak embroidered with dragons and phoenixes—garish to the extreme.

Behind him stood Demon General Xueli and Meng Ge, each a step behind the middle-aged man, their expressions serious; when they looked upon his back there was even a trace of...fear and reverence.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes as a storm of shock surged within him.
