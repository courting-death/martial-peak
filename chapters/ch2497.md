## Chapter 2497 — Primordial Gale, Divine Tree Baiyi

Now that the arrow was on the string, it had to be released. Yang Kai gritted his teeth and, with a wave of his hand, scattered countless Source Crystals from his Spatial Ring, spreading them all around himself.

Immediately, he sat cross-legged, emptied his mind, and ignored all unsettling factors, focusing solely on comprehending the fluctuations of the Heavenly Dao stirred up by the clash between the two Great Emperors.

Such an advancement—no one in history had ever attempted it before.

Yang Kai was also left with no other choice.

But he quickly realized this might be a stroke of fortune, because every gesture and even the verbal exchanges between the two Great Emperors carried traces of mysterious power, subtly resonating with the truths of the Heavenly Dao.

It was as if he were absorbing the two Great Emperors’ insights into the Heavenly Dao, using them as a foundation to glimpse his own path in the Martial Dao.

The benefits were simply indescribable.

Yang Kai soon forgot everything around him, completely immersed in the process. The Source Crystals surrounding him, shaken by the intense opportunity, all turned to dust. Pure, dense Spiritual Qi drifted out from the Source Crystals, slowly gathering above Yang Kai’s head, gradually forming a celestial phenomenon.

“Hm? There’s even a little bug!”

Although the two Great Emperors were locked in a fierce struggle, seemingly with no attention to spare, at their level of cultivation, their senses were extremely keen. The slightest disturbance from Yang Kai’s side was immediately noticed. Wu Kuang, even in the midst of battle, glanced over at Yang Kai, his eyes flashing with disdain.

A mere Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—he truly didn’t take him seriously.

Not to mention his peak, even now, he could crush a Dao Origin Realm cultivator like an ant.

“How did this brat get in here?” Duan Hongchen was slightly startled.

This place was Wu Kuang’s fake-death hiding spot, so the entrance was protected by his unique restriction. Normally, not to mention entering, it was impossible even to discover it.

Otherwise, after so many openings of the Shattered Star Sea over tens of thousands of years, Duan Hongchen wouldn’t have only found this place today.

He had long known that the Origin Sea was Wu Kuang’s hiding place, but exactly where, he had never been able to determine. Only when the Origin Sea underwent an abnormal change this time, and a black hole formed, devouring the flesh and blood essence of countless cultivators, was he able to enter.

This was all thanks to his understanding of Wu Kuang, which allowed him to break the restriction at the entrance.

No other Emperor Realm cultivator could have done it. Even a Third Stage Emperor would only be left sighing in frustration.

How did Yang Kai have the ability to enter here? Could it be that after he entered, the restriction at the entrance loosened, giving Yang Kai a chance?

Duan Hongchen felt a bit regretful. Had he known, he would have destroyed the entrance after coming in.

What he didn’t know was that Yang Kai was able to enter entirely because of the jade slip left behind by Wu Mengchuan after his death. That jade slip was essentially a key—whoever held it could ignore the entrance restriction and enter this place.

This was also something Wu Kuang had left for his descendants back in the day.

Everything was a matter of chance.

What let Duan Hongchen breathe a little easier was that he only found traces of Yang Kai and didn’t see the two girls, Mo Xiaoqi and Zhang Ruoxi. If those two were here as well, today’s events would be much more troublesome.

“You dare to be distracted while fighting this Lord? Duan Hongchen, today you deserve to die!” Wu Kuang shouted, bringing his hands together and thrusting them forward.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh…

A strange sound rang out as a fierce gale suddenly swept from his palms, surging toward Duan Hongchen.

This gale was no ordinary wind—it carried the aura of elemental Origin itself. Wherever it swept, heaven and earth collapsed, space shattered, and the scene became utterly terrifying.

“Primordial Gale!” Duan Hongchen’s face changed dramatically as he exclaimed, “You’ve lost your physical body, yet you can still wield the Primordial Gale!”

Wu Kuang sneered, “The Primordial Gale is the power of Origin, formless and intangible, connected to this Lord’s will. Who told you that losing my body means I can’t use it? Hahaha! To underestimate this Lord is to pay the price. Even if I’m nothing but bones, I am not someone you can look down upon.”

As he spoke, the Primordial Gale had already reached Duan Hongchen, about to engulf him.

At this critical moment, the panic in Duan Hongchen’s eyes vanished, replaced by a look of solemn determination. Forming a series of hand seals, he suddenly thrust his hands downward as if pulling something from the earth, and shouted in a low voice, “Draw the ground as a prison!”

Crash…

A verdant light suddenly burst forth, enveloping Duan Hongchen. At the same time, the phantom of a colossal tree appeared, spanning the heavens and earth.

This green tree phantom, much like the Primordial Gale, radiated pure elemental Origin Power.

Boom boom boom…

The Primordial Gale crashed against the green tree, making its leaves rustle violently, but it couldn’t penetrate Duan Hongchen’s defenses. All its power was blocked, leaving him unharmed.

“Divine Tree Baiyi!” Wu Kuang cried out in shock at the sight, staring incredulously at the green tree’s shadow. He gnashed his teeth and roared, “Duan Hongchen, you dare make a fool of this Lord?!”

Earlier, seeing Duan Hongchen’s panicked appearance, he thought the other had no way to deal with the Primordial Gale. Who would have thought, in the blink of an eye, he would summon the phantom of the Divine Tree Baiyi and completely block the gale.

This was clearly mockery, letting him experience the crushing disappointment from joy to despair—utterly unforgivable.

While channeling his Emperor Yuan to maintain the phantom of the Divine Tree Baiyi, Duan Hongchen wiped the cold sweat from his brow and grinned, “That nearly scared this old man to death. Luckily, I came prepared—otherwise, I really might have capsized in the gutter this time.”

“Outrageous! You dare liken this Lord to a gutter—Duan Hongchen, your courage has truly grown!” Wu Kuang roared, eyes blazing with unwilling fury. “And that Baiyi Origin Power—wasn’t it Iron Blood’s prized possession? He guarded it like a treasure; how could it have ended up in your hands?” His expression shifted abruptly as a thought struck him. “Could it be… that Iron Blood has already fallen?”

Duan Hongchen snorted, “Though I wish that guy would die and reincarnate soon, disappointingly, he doesn’t even show signs of aging. In fact, he’s getting younger. It’s enough to make one jealous. Lately, he even took in a little disciple, teaching her with all his heart. Who knows what he’s after? Disciples are nothing but trouble for their masters—just thinking about it brings tears.”

Who knows if he was thinking of Wen Zishan as he spoke, grinding his teeth in frustration.

Wu Kuang snapped, “If he’s still alive, how could he possibly hand over the Divine Wood Origin to you? There’s no way he’d be willing!”

Duan Hongchen grinned, “Because I told him, if he didn’t hand over the Divine Wood Origin, I’d gather several hundred or a thousand young, handsome men to seduce his precious disciple and see if she could resist! He gave in obediently.”

Wu Kuang’s face darkened, speechless. “That actually worked?”

Duan Hongchen curled his lip and said, “You have no idea how much he dotes on that precious disciple of his. That little girl seems to have some special constitution—she’s practically born to inherit his mantle. I’ve met her myself, and let me tell you, these youngsters nowadays are truly something else. So young, yet she already has a hint of Iron Blood’s old style—one punch from her could kill her own master! When I left the Iron Blood Fort, she punched me so hard my brow split and blood was everywhere!”

Wu Kuang burst out laughing, “Serves you right! There’s probably no one in this world more shameless than you.”

“You flatter me!” Duan Hongchen smiled faintly.

Wu Kuang said, “So what if you have the Divine Wood Origin? You’re not its first master—how can you compete with this Lord’s Primordial Gale?”

“Whether I can or not, I have to try. Should I just sit and wait for death?”

As the two fought, their banter sometimes sounded like old friends reminiscing, sometimes like mortal enemies locked in a life-and-death struggle. Anyone watching would be utterly confused.

Meanwhile, the two types of elemental Origin Power clashed madly, shattering space and filling the sky with wind and wood energy—a terrifying sight.

The sweeping Primordial Gale was so powerful that even an Emperor Realm cultivator caught in it would be reduced to bones. Yet the phantom of the Divine Tree Baiyi was as solid as a fortress, unmoved by the raging winds, its leaves rustling as it perfectly protected Duan Hongchen.

Within a hundred li, space and vision were distorted, and all the blood on the ground was evaporated clean.

This contest was a test of their control over their respective elemental Origin Power, and the outcome wouldn’t be decided quickly. With the situation as it was, neither Wu Kuang nor Duan Hongchen could easily back down.

If Wu Kuang withdrew the Primordial Gale, Duan Hongchen would surely seize the chance to counterattack. In his current state, he couldn’t withstand the assault of the Divine Wood Origin Power.

Whether it was the Primordial Gale or the Divine Wood Origin, both were treasures on par with the True Phoenix Fire—not only rare and precious, but also infinitely powerful.

Especially since Wu Kuang was now just a skeleton, the Divine Wood Origin was particularly lethal to him. If it invaded his body, he could forget about ever regaining his flesh.

He didn’t dare let his guard down in the slightest.

From his initial disdain, he had now been forced to take this clash in earnest.

Duan Hongchen had waited tens of thousands of years to enter this place and deal with him—how could he not be prepared? Judging by the results, everything Duan Hongchen displayed was deliberately aimed at him.

The two Great Emperors were locked in a life-and-death struggle here. Even though they knew Yang Kai was advancing to the Emperor Realm nearby, neither paid him any mind, nor did they restrain the aftermath of their attacks.

Wu Kuang didn’t care whether Yang Kai lived or died, while Duan Hongchen had no choice.

Although he knew Yang Kai was a disciple of the Qingyang Shrine and wanted to protect him if possible, fighting the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor left him no room to spare a thought for anything else. He could only give his all against Wu Kuang.
