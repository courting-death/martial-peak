## Chapter 2503 — The Blade Arrives

Neither Duan Hongchen nor Wu Kuang paid any attention to Yang Kai’s words.

“Hey, I’m talking to you two.” Yang Kai looked at them bitterly. “Can’t you at least give me a reaction?”

Only then did Wu Kuang coldly say, “If you make him scram, this Lord will leave immediately!”

Duan Hongchen barked, “You actually have the nerve to say such childish nonsense, Wu Kuang? You’re getting more shameless by the day.” He spat at Wu Kuang with contempt, then turned to Yang Kai without so much as a glance and said, “Kid, bear with it. Today, the two of us are going to fight to the death here. If you end up perishing because of it, you can only blame your bad luck. But if you manage to survive, you’ll benefit endlessly!”

Yang Kai sighed, “Forget it, Senior Hongchen, just go ahead. I’ll take care of myself.”

Duan Hongchen burst out laughing, greatly invigorated. “Good! With your words, this old man can go all out!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he formed a seal with both hands and suddenly pointed toward Wu Kuang.

Wu Kuang’s expression changed drastically as he shouted, “You’re serious?”

Duan Hongchen’s face was cold as he replied icily, “Do I look like I’m playing around with you?”

“You’re really infuriating this Lord, Duan Hongchen! Today, don’t even think about leaving here alive. Even if my Divine Soul is damaged, I’ll make sure yours is scattered!”

Even a rabbit will bite when cornered, let alone the infamous Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. Forced again and again by Duan Hongchen, even his Divine Soul had been chased into this place. Wu Kuang had no way out, and with a furious roar, he was ready to risk everything.

As they spoke, the two had already clashed. In an instant, the Sea of Consciousness churned, waves surging to the sky. Two figures intertwined above Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, colliding fiercely again and again.

This was a battle of Divine Souls—far more dangerous than any ordinary life-and-death struggle.

Every move they used was a Divine Soul secret art. Their Divine Senses collided, erupting in visible ripples of light again and again.

Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness was completely unstable.

From the moment Duan Hongchen made his first move, Yang Kai had already flickered over to the center of the island formed by the Warm Spirit Lotus, fully activating its power. Under the brilliant seven-colored glow, he was tightly enveloped.

With two Great Emperor-level Spirit Bodies fighting in his Sea of Consciousness, no matter how well he hid, he couldn’t possibly remain unscathed. He himself was the battlefield, and his only reliance was the Warm Spirit Lotus.

This was a supreme treasure for nurturing Divine Sense. Even the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had once searched countless Star Domains for it, showing just how precious it was.

Bathed in the seven-colored light, it was like an impregnable defense. The aftershocks of the two Great Emperors’ attacks only stirred ripples on the glow, unable to harm Yang Kai in the slightest.

Realizing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel relieved. He had truly feared that even the Warm Spirit Lotus wouldn’t be enough. If that were the case, he’d have been doomed this time.

But even with the Warm Spirit Lotus’s protection, Yang Kai’s head still throbbed painfully. His Spirit Body trembled uncontrollably, and every part of him felt as if it were being torn apart.

Every attack from Duan Hongchen and Wu Kuang was like a sharp blade slashing at him, inevitably leaving him with some injuries.

The Warm Spirit Lotus’s wondrous power took effect. Whenever that tearing pain struck, a gentle force would spread through his body, like an invisible hand softly soothing his wounds, allowing him to quickly calm down.

Gradually, Yang Kai grew accustomed to the sensation.

He no longer felt much pain and instead began to focus on the two Great Emperors.

He didn’t need to observe closely; every move the two made was imprinted clearly in his mind.

Anywhere else, Yang Kai would never be able to do this. But here, in his own Sea of Consciousness, everything was within his perception. No matter how fast or fierce Wu Kuang and Duan Hongchen were, he could sense it all.

Yang Kai watched in amazement, eyes fixed on the scene.

Because every technique the two Great Emperors used here was a profound and unparalleled Divine Soul secret art, and their manipulation of Divine Soul power was wondrous to behold.

No wonder Duan Hongchen had said earlier that if he survived, he would benefit endlessly—so this was what he meant.

In this situation, every secret art the two Great Emperors used was laid bare before Yang Kai, and he could fully comprehend their mysteries. This was far more efficient than even the closest master-disciple teaching, like a sudden revelation.

It was as if the two Great Emperors were pouring all their divine abilities into Yang Kai without reservation, and he learned them instantly.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai was deeply shaken. He realized that his understanding and use of Divine Soul power was on a completely different level from the two Great Emperors.

With the same amount of power, he could only shatter a boulder, but the two Great Emperors could split a mountain—that was the difference.

Yang Kai’s heart surged with excitement. He understood that this rare opportunity had instantly raised his starting point to incredible heights. Even if he hadn’t yet broken through to the Emperor Realm and was still at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the strength he could now wield was several times greater than before.

If Divine Soul power could be used so marvelously, then Origin Qi could as well.

Suddenly, he shouted, “Senior Hongchen, don’t hold back! I’m fine!”

After watching for a while, he saw that Duan Hongchen was completely on the defensive, being thoroughly suppressed by Wu Kuang and forced to retreat again and again above the Sea of Consciousness.

It wasn’t that Duan Hongchen’s Divine Soul power was inferior to Wu Kuang’s, but that he was somewhat apprehensive, not daring to use too much force for fear of harming Yang Kai.

Though he had spoken so boldly just now, anyone who holds the fate of the world in their heart would naturally hesitate to endanger even a single life.

Hearing this, Duan Hongchen managed to spare a glance at Yang Kai. Seeing the island formed by the Warm Spirit Lotus, his eyes lit up and he laughed, “Good! Now this old man has nothing to worry about!”

He clearly recognized the Warm Spirit Lotus at a glance. Knowing it was protecting Yang Kai, he understood that no matter how fiercely he and Wu Kuang fought, Yang Kai wouldn’t be affected much.

As soon as he finished speaking, his aura soared, and he immediately turned the situation around, fighting Wu Kuang back and forth with great enthusiasm.

The increasingly fierce impacts and techniques made Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness even more turbulent, but with the Warm Spirit Lotus guarding his Spirit Body, he wouldn’t suffer any serious injuries no matter what happened.

Yang Kai gradually became immersed in the profound Divine Soul secret arts and their applications, unable to extricate himself, as if a new door was slowly opening before him, letting him glimpse a dazzling light within.

The two Great Emperors fought more and more fiercely, both covered in wounds. Their Spirit Bodies flickered wildly, with victory and defeat trading back and forth.

This was a battle to the death—there would be no end until one side perished.

As time passed, the power they unleashed gradually weakened, clearly due to heavy consumption and injuries.

The churning Sea of Consciousness began to calm, no longer as wild as before.

No one knew how much time had passed when Yang Kai, still immersed in that wondrous feeling, suddenly heard a low shout by his ear: “Kid!”

Yang Kai was startled, instantly snapping out of his comprehension.

Looking up, he was momentarily stunned.

At some point, the two Great Emperors who had been fighting to the death had stopped. Their Spirit Bodies were entangled, each using some secret art to restrain the other, like two wrestlers twisted together on the ground.

Their Spirit Bodies glowed dimly, their auras weak, as if they might extinguish at any moment.

Duan Hongchen’s expression was solemn, Wu Kuang’s face was gloomy, but neither would let go.

“Senior, what are your instructions?” Yang Kai asked respectfully.

“Use your strongest Divine Soul secret art to attack us—preferably one that can scatter our souls!” Duan Hongchen gritted out.

Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly.

Wu Kuang’s face also turned cold. He glanced at Yang Kai and snorted disdainfully, “Duan Hongchen, you’re senile. What secret art could a newly advanced Emperor possibly have that could harm us?”

Duan Hongchen grinned, “This kid isn’t ordinary. If you underestimate him, you’ll regret it.”

Wu Kuang sneered, “Then this Lord will wait and see.”

Duan Hongchen snorted, “Kid, what are you hesitating for? This old thing wants to see your skills—hurry up and show him!”

Yang Kai hesitated, “Senior…”

Before he could finish, Duan Hongchen roared, “If Wu Kuang is reborn, the tragedy from tens of thousands of years ago will repeat itself! I’ve waited tens of thousands of years for this day and am ready to perish with him. If we miss today, there will never be another chance. Kid, don’t let me down!”

Who knows what secret art he used as he shouted, but his resolute voice rang in Yang Kai’s ears like a morning bell, stirring his heart.

As their eyes met, Yang Kai clearly saw the plea in Duan Hongchen’s eyes and felt his determination.

Filled with respect, Yang Kai slowly stood up from the Warm Spirit Lotus and walked step by step toward the two.

When he reached above them, Yang Kai said solemnly, “Senior, is there anything you want me to tell Hall Master Wen?”

Duan Hongchen grinned freely, “No need. He knows what I’ve been doing all these years!”

Yang Kai nodded, bowed deeply, and said solemnly, “Then, Senior… safe journey!”

Duan Hongchen smiled faintly and closed his eyes.

Wu Kuang said nothing, only looked at Yang Kai coldly, full of disdain, clearly not believing Yang Kai could really kill him.

“Blade, come!” Yang Kai suddenly shouted, divine light flashing in his eyes. He stretched out his hand, and a long blade suddenly appeared in his palm. The blade seemed to sense his inner turmoil, humming incessantly with a strange sound.
