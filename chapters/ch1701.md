## Chapter 1701 — Strange Disappearance

Although Yang Kai's presence had caused Shang Ao some concern, he did not dwell on it for long.

The Sea Race looked down upon all others. From beginning to end, they believed that, as beings born of the vast ocean, they were the noblest creatures under heaven — and that all other races, especially the innumerable humans, ought to bow before them in submission.

And they had reason for such arrogance — every member of the Sea Clan was born innately attuned to Water Element cultivation arts and martial techniques, unlike the humans, among whom many lived their whole lives without ever cultivating, unable to escape the cycle of birth, aging, sickness, and death — forever remaining mere mortals.

Yang Kai had come to learn the Sea Race's haughty nature firsthand.

The beautiful woman standing beside Shang Ao looked down, parted her vermilion lips, and said, “Island Lord Pang, this is not the first time we have met; we know each other well, so I will speak plainly: the Sea God Palace has an important person who went missing near your Xiaguang Island, and we have reason to suspect that Sea Hall abducted that important individual. I ask that you hand them over.”

Though the woman had tried to maintain a calm tone, her expression had betrayed a deep anxiety.

Pang Zhen naturally recognized this Sea Race woman and frowned. “Your important person? Who might that be?” he asked.

He was curious about the missing Sea Race's identity; he sensed the person must hold a high position in the Sea Race, possibly a royal—otherwise Shang Ao and this woman would not have come together, nor displayed such imposing airs.

In any case, he intended to find out.

The woman shook her head lightly and replied in a pleasant voice, “I am sorry, I cannot tell you who it is.”

Pang Zhen sneered coldly, “Commander Qian Mo, are you sure you’re not joking? Just because of a single guess of yours, the Sea God Palace sends so many Origin Returning Realm cultivators to trouble my Xiaguang Island—do you really take my Sea Hall for something to be bullied at will?”

The woman named Qian Mo furrowed her delicate brows, hesitating for a moment before saying, “It isn’t merely my conjecture — the exalted one truly went missing near Xiaguang Island. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have come all this way.”

Pang Zhen’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Qian Mo was one of the eight Commanders of the Sea God Palace, an equal in rank to Shang Ao — her status was lofty, and within the Sea Clan, few stood above her. Yet even she addressed the missing Sea Clan member as 'the exalted one' — proof enough of that person’s extraordinary standing.

Could it be that a royal of the Sea God Palace had gone missing? That would not be a trivial matter. Pang Zhen immediately realized the gravity of the situation; if it were an obscure Sea Race member he could have dismissed it, but not if it was a royal.

A mishandling could easily spark a war between Sea Hall and the Sea God Palace—an outcome no one wanted to see.

After pondering in silence for a long time, Pang Zhen finally said solemnly, “My Xiaguang Island has not discovered any Sea Race members recently; perhaps Commander Qian is mistaken….”

Qian Mo interrupted him. “If Island Lord Pang would permit it, I would like to search Xiaguang Island. May I?”

“Only a search?” Pang Zhen eyed her cautiously. Given the present circumstances the request did not seem excessive; in another time he might have refused, but since a royal could be involved, refusal might provoke Shang Ao's short temper and lead to a battle.

So Pang Zhen had to make some concessions.

“Only a search,” Qian Mo assured him. “I know that person well; if she were indeed on Xiaguang Island I would be able to sense her, no matter whether someone hid her.”

When she spoke the last sentence, Qian Mo's gaze sharpened like the edge of a blade.

One could imagine that if her suspicion proved correct, Xiaguang Island would run red with blood that very day.

Pang Zhen hesitated. The other side spoke so firmly that he could not be certain of his judgment. Though he was island lord, Xiaguang Island housed so many Sea Hall disciples that any one of them might have secretly brought back a Sea Race member without permission…

“Very well, I will agree,” Pang Zhen said in a deep voice. What could not be avoided would not be avoided. He could only hope the Sea Race's concerns were mistaken.

“Thank you.” Qian Mo inclined her head, then released her Divine Sense, letting it spread inch by inch over Xiaguang Island.

Everyone waited in silence. Along the vast stretch of shoreline, hundreds of powerful cultivators stood without uttering a word; even their breathing was suppressed — one could have heard a pin drop.

Shang Ao was anxious as if constipated; the scar on his face had never looked more ferocious. He glanced between Qian Mo and Pang Zhen, his eyes round as copper bells.

At length Qian Mo suddenly opened her eyes.

Pang Zhen fixed his gaze solemnly on her.

“Well?” Shang Ao asked hurriedly.

A trace of disappointment crossed Qian Mo's face; she looked at Shang Ao and slowly shook her head: “Not here!”

“Impossible!” Shang Ao cried. “She went missing near Xiaguang Island—how could she not be here? Someone must have been mistaken… Wait, could she have been transferred? Xiaguang Island had a Space Array, and Sea Hall's islands could be interconnected…”

“Shang Ao, if it’s battle you want, then battle it is! Enough of your blustering!” Pang Zhen roared, this time sounding far more confident than before.

Already enraged, Shang Ao's fury flared at Pang Zhen's words; his eyes narrowed and a surging force stirred within him.

Qian Mo spoke before him: “Island Lord Pang, this time the mistake was on our side. I apologize for the trouble caused to your island. I shall come to your island to apologize properly another day.”

Hearing her say that, Pang Zhen's expression improved considerably.

The Sea Race had always looked down on humans; that Qian Mo would say such words showed how anxious she truly was—she had no energy left to maintain her pride, and whether she later made a formal apology mattered little now.

Pang Zhen was no fool; knowing when to stop, he gave a slight nod and said evenly, “In that case, I won’t be seeing you off. Farewell.”

The Sea Race's powerful figures left without a word, though Shang Ao cast Pang Zhen a resentful glance as he departed, as if itching for a battle to vent his frustration.

Only after the Sea Race had retreated a thousand li did Pang Zhen finally exhale a heavy breath.

The other high-ranking figures on Xiaguang Island exchanged glances and forced smiles, sweating coldly at the back of their necks.

Though they had shown a rigid stance a moment before, each of them had felt their hearts rise into their throats; with Xiaguang Island's current strength, confronting the two commanders and the Sea Race's elite troops would not be easy.

Fortunately, the matter had been resolved without a battle.

“Island Lord, who exactly went missing from the Sea Race? To make Shang Ao and Qian Mo so anxious—” someone asked from the side.

Pang Zhen signaled to the man without answering at once, then smiled at Yang Kai. “Sect Master Yang Kai, I have caused you embarrassment. I have just received word that the main hall's people will arrive on Xiaguang Island in three days; I ask Sect Master Yang Kai to bear with us and stay a few more days.”

Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Island Lord Pang's hospitality is generous; I would not refuse. Yet it seemed your hall was not very interested in my proposal.”

Pang Zhen opened his mouth, unsure how to explain.

From his perspective, Sea Hall had been somewhat negligent, so he could only offer an awkward smile.

Yang Kai had no intention of forcing the issue; he made a few noncommittal remarks, then took his leave and returned to the place Pang Zhen had arranged for him to stay.

Since Sea Hall had not been enthusiastic about his proposal, Yang Kai did not press them—his attention turned instead to the Sea Race.

As Pang Zhen had said, the Sea Race possessed natural advantages and could extract far greater cultivation resources than Sea Hall. If the Sea Race could be persuaded to cooperate with Lingxiao Sect, the prospect would be far brighter than cooperating with Sea Hall.

The difficulty, however, lay in trying to cooperate with the Sea Race.

Unless they were subdued by force, success seemed unlikely.

In the deep night Yang Kai opened his eyes and gazed thoughtfully in a certain direction; he had noticed Pang Zhen and some of Xiaguang Island's experts leave the island and did not know their destination.

He suspected they had gone to search for the missing important Sea Race person.

For Shang Ao and Qian Mo to be so concerned the individual's status had to be high; if Pang Zhen could find them it would be a great achievement—something that could be used to negotiate with the Sea God Palace or exchange for resources.

Under his perception, the Sea Race's experts had not left Xiaguang Island very far; they were operating within a radius of thirty thousand li.

They seemed convinced their kinsman had vanished near Xiaguang Island and thus confined their search to that area.

Yang Kai found it amusing and wondered what the scene would be like if the two sides ran into each other.

That thought proved unnecessary; both Xiaguang Island's warriors and the Sea Race's practitioners were doing their best to avoid each other's positions and not interfere.

Suddenly a presence vanished from Yang Kai's perception.

Before he could determine the cause another vanished, then a third, a fourth—

Within a very short time a dozen or so life signs had disappeared in a strange fashion.

This was not an extinction born of death, but a complete and utter disappearance.

Yang Kai's face registered astonishment.

Now the Star Lord of Dark Star, he could monitor any location he wished if he chose to do so.

Yet he could find no trace of how those beings had vanished.

They had simply ceased to exist without cause.

Not even their companions had noticed.

At first only Sea Race members disappeared, then Xiaguang Island's experts began to vanish one after another; by the time the remainder realized something was wrong it was too late—of the one or two hundred warriors from both sides, only a scant few remained, and in the brief time that followed those too were gone, as if they had never appeared at all.
