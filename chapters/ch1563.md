## Chapter 1563 — Returning to the Spider Mother’s Nest

Xia Ningshang had not entered the Xuan Realm Pearl; she was now at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and would not be a drag on Yang Kai, and since she had just broken through there was much for her to learn, so Yang Kai kept her by his side where he could teach her.

Besides, wandering about with such beauty at one’s side was a most pleasing matter.

Hearing Yang Kai say that, she immediately asked, "Whom are we looking for?"

"Elder Li!" Yang Kai said, looking at her.

Xia Ningshang understood at once; she gave a light nod, closed her lovely eyes, and began to search.

Now she was the Star Lord of the Tongxuan Continent, having refined the Stellar Origin; with a thought she could traverse anywhere on the continent at will. Here, she was sovereign!

Finding someone was still very easy for her.

She linked her mind to the Stellar Origin of the Tongxuan Continent, sensing the messages the continent's flora and fauna sent back, and from those signals distinguished the trail of the person she sought; in less than half a day she leisurely opened her eyes and cried, "Found him!"

Yang Kai's spirit stirred; he stepped forward and took Xia Ningshang's small hand. "Take me to pay him a visit."

Xia Ningshang lightly nodded, extended her jade hand and pointed forward; an inky vortex instantly formed in the void as if to swallow all, and the two of them slipped inside, vanishing in an instant.

On an unnamed barren mountain, the soil was thin and desolate, and a few thatch huts stood atop the peak.

No one would have guessed that this was the recluse’s home of the famed Tianzang Elder Li Rui.

Yang Kai greatly respected Elder Li, not only because he was the continent's longest-lived sage — having reached the Saint Realm and lived for over a thousand years — but because he had lavished teachings on Yang Kai in the past.

When the Bone Race revived long ago, Elder Li had come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and, by virtue of his immense reputation, rallied all humanity together, doing Yang Kai a great service.

This time, upon returning to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Yang Kai found neither Elder Li nor his disciple Zhai Yao.

Given Elder Li's free and wandering nature, it was unlikely he would remain in one place for long; thus he had apparently left the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Now that Yang Kai was about to head once more into the Star Domain, he naturally wished Elder Li to accompany him.

"Is it here?" Xia Ningshang led Yang Kai to the barren peak less than a thousand zhang high, and Yang Kai couldn't help but frown.

"Yes." Xia Ningshang nodded gently. "But I can't sense Elder Li's aura. Only Senior Brother's..."

At her words, a bad feeling suddenly rose in Yang Kai's chest. He looked ahead; the few simple thatch huts came into view. In front of the huts were patches of medicinal fields, but they were not planted with spiritual herbs for cultivation, merely ordinary medicinal plants.

These herbs were splendid for treating ordinary people's illnesses, but utterly useless for cultivation.

One man was tending the fields, watering and fertilizing, repeating the monotonous motions with meticulous care.

Yang Kai strode toward him.

"Seeking medical aid?" the man watering heard the sound, did not raise his head, and casually asked.

"Senior Brother Zhai, long time no see!" Yang Kai smiled at him and greeted him.

Zhai Yao paused in his motions as if realizing something; he slowly straightened, looked up at Yang Kai, and upon recognizing him could not help but grin broadly.

A set of gleaming white teeth paired with a face as delicate as a flower such that even women would envy it; a setting sun behind him cast its afterglow, splashing a golden halo about him.

The kid was still ridiculously handsome...

Zhai Yao stepped forward two paces and hugged Yang Kai hard.

"Brother Yang, when did you return?" He seemed not the least surprised, as if he had long known Yang Kai would return safely.

"Nearly two months now."

Zhai Yao gave a light nod, brushed the dirt from his hands, and enthusiastically called, "Come, today we drink and make merry!"

"Very well!" Yang Kai responded promptly.

They sat on the ground in front of the thatch hut; there were no delicacies, only the stars overhead and the breeze to season their drink. Xia Ningshang sat nearby, holding a wine flask, pouring for Yang Kai and Zhai Yao.

The sky was filled with stars. In front of the thatched hut, friends arrived from afar—filling the heart with quiet delight.

"Master passed away more than twenty years ago." Zhai Yao suddenly said bluntly.

Although Yang Kai had long suspected this, when he heard the news his hand holding the cup trembled slightly.

Zhai Yao grinned and said, “He passed peacefully. Master had long reached that age.”

With cultivation at the Saint Realm, living for over a thousand years was something no ordinary person could achieve. Elder Li, well-versed in the study of medicine, had prolonged his life by nurturing his body with wondrous Spiritual Pills.

"Brother Zhai, take comfort." Yang Kai thought for a time and did not know what else to say.

Zhai Yao laughed, "Master's legacy remains; he lives on in my heart!"

Yang Kai looked at him and smiled, feeling a weight lift from his chest.

"Brother Yang, what brings you to see Master?" Zhai Yao asked.

"Nothing special. I'm leaving again and I wish Elder Li and you to accompany me."

"Into the Star Domain?" Zhai Yao narrowed his eyes.

"Indeed." Yang Kai nodded.

Zhai Yao fell silent for a while, then shook his head and said, "Master raised and taught me; he bestowed me a debt of gratitude as heavy as a mountain. I cannot leave him here alone."

Yang Kai opened his mouth, but before he could press him to change his mind, Zhai Yao smiled, "Brother Yang, say no more — my mind is made up!"

Seeing his resolve, Yang Kai could only sigh.

There was wine; they drank wildly until drunkenness overcame them!

When dawn came, Zhai Yao sprawled on the ground snoring; Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang found a simple grave atop the mountain, offered solemn bow, left some cultivation resources with Zhai Yao, and then took their leave in silence.

"Are you really going to leave Senior Brother Zhai there alone?" Xia Ningshang still seemed uneasy.

"It is his own decision." Yang Kai replied lightly.

"But..." Xia Ningshang appeared about to say more.

"It may not be a bad thing. When one day you cultivate to greatness and the continent renews its vigor, it will make no difference whether Brother Zhai left or not."

Xia Ningshang nodded to show she understood, then after a moment asked, "Where shall we go now?"

"To Zhongdu. There should be a shortcut to the Star Domain there, and we can pay a visit to someone we both know." Yang Kai smiled faintly.

In short time they arrived at the territory of the Xiaoyao Divine Cult and traveled through a Void Passage, emerging not far from the Lingxiao Pavilion.

After the Great Demon God's seal was lifted, the Tongxuan Continent and the Zhongdu world were connected, and that Void Passage had long existed on the Xiaoyao Divine Cult's domain; Yang Kai was familiar with it.

The Zhongdu side of the world had been the starting place of his life.

Upon arrival, Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense and immediately perceived that the original Lingxiao Pavilion now harbored many people; whether occupied by some family or minor sect, it now seemed quite prosperous.

He did not disturb them. The warriors here were as weak as children compared to him now.

He also did not go into Zhongdu proper. Of the original Zhongdu Eight Great Families, the three closest to him were inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, while the remaining five had spread and lived in Zhongdu; Yang Kai had no interest in them.

He and his Little Senior Sister flew straight toward the Cangyun Evil Land.

Although his Little Senior Sister was a Star Lord of the Tongxuan Continent, she could not instantly traverse Zhongdu's world by millions of miles; this place had its own heavenly laws, a world apart.

Yang Kai did not originally know how that world had been formed, but witnessing the Tongxuan Continent's birth, rise, and decline made him suspect Zhongdu's world had something to do with ancient powerful cultivators.

Perhaps it had been carved out by those whose cultivation defied heaven; even that was not certain.

The Cangyun Evil Land was as chaotic as ever. Previously several evil kings maintained order; though the land bred filth and wickedness, at least some rules were observed.

But after those evil kings died or vanished, the Cangyun Evil Land became a place of lawless chaos.

All manners of people came and went — robbery, burning, and slaughter occurred freely; here, no principle existed but might.

As they traveled, the two saw nothing but depravity and maddening atrocities.

Yang Kai could remain calm, but his Little Senior Sister could not help herself and struck down a few shameless bullies with heavy blows, venting some of her righteous fury.

Piaoxiang City had once been governed by the Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo and was the last pure land of the Cangyun Evil Land.

But since Shan Qingluo's disappearance, this final sanctuary had been tainted and the city plunged into darkness and chaos.

Passing by, Yang Kai could not help but reminisce.

He and that enchantress had grown close on this very soil, but after he returned from the Tongxuan Continent he had never seen her again.

He had thought he would never meet Shan Qingluo again in this life.

Unexpectedly, during the Imperial Garden affair he learned of her whereabouts and even met and fought alongside her.

Yang Kai found that most seductive of women hard to forget...

Their destination was the Spider Mother’s Nest. According to Biluo, Shan Qingluo's personal maid, the two had inadvertently opened a sacrificial altar within the Spider Mother’s Nest and were sent to Yao Star Di Chen in the Star Domain.

Thus, Yang Kai intended to make use of that altar as well. If things went smoothly, he could not only visit that enchantress to see how she was faring, but also save a great deal of time.

He had no desire to spend several years on a warship merely to travel.

The Spider Mother’s Nest was not far from Piaoxiang City — only a few ten-thousand li — and at Yang Kai's current speed they would arrive in merely half a cup of tea's time.

The Spider Mother’s Nest remained the same, dilapidated and forlorn; after its collapse long ago the place had been abandoned.

Arriving there, Yang Kai, familiar with the place, entered the great spider statue and easily found a strange altar inside.

The altar was only about one person high, but its surface was etched with dense, complex patterns, part wondrous formation, part ancient script.

Yang Kai extended his Divine Sense to probe it, finding nothing overtly abnormal.

Yet there were dark stains lingering on the altar.

They were the blood stains left by Shan Qingluo that day!
