## Chapter 367 — This is Your Sect?

On the morning of the following day, Tang Yuxian woke from her meditation and turned her head to look around, slowly rising to walk away.

Not far away, Tu Feng stood with his hands behind his back, staring ahead, completely motionless.

"What are you doing?" Tang Yuxian asked as she approached him, a look of confusion on her face.

"Shh..." Tu Feng quickly gestured to her, then motioned for her to look ahead.

Mystified, Tang Yuxian rolled her eyes and followed his direction to gaze ahead, momentarily stunned.

There, not far in front, a certain young master of her family was striking a most peculiar pose, standing on one leg while stretching out his arms, resembling the wings of a bird, rhythmically moving up and down.

At a glance, it seemed he was indeed mimicking a bird soaring in the sky, full of graceful flair.

What surprised Tang Yuxian even more was that the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle before him was mimicking the same movements.

Its golden wings spread wide, emitting continuous cries, the wings flapping with such vigor that it stirred up gusts of wind.

However, the Golden Feather Eagle now no longer seemed as hostile as it had days prior, and its cries even carried a hint of affection.

As time passed, when the movements of the human and eagle perfectly synchronized, both gradually lifted off the ground together.

In that instant, it seemed as if the person and eagle had merged into one, indistinguishable from each other.

Both Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were rendered speechless, surprised expressions on their faces.

Despite their formidable power and exceptional Realm, they felt utterly helpless against the Golden Feather Eagle. In the entire Yang Family, aside from the specialized trainer, it rarely acknowledged anyone. Yet now it played with the young master.

This was after the young master had plucked two of its golden feathers!

For a moment, both Blood Servants felt a surreal sensation, exchanging bewildered glances. Their eyes reflected confusion and astonishment, wondering what miraculous method Yang Kai had employed to achieve this.

After a while, the human and eagle had soared to dozens of zhang above the ground.

With a loud laugh, Yang Kai suddenly turned and jumped onto the back of the Golden Feather Eagle. Under the watchful eyes of the two Blood Servants, the eagle let out a crisp cry and soared into the sky.

The eagle's back was not particularly wide, barely accommodating a single person.

However, whether it was Tu Feng or Tang Yuxian, they could clearly sense that Yang Kai was not exerting any strength or True Yuan; he was entirely being carried by the eagle, which was doing so willingly.

"Wasn't it said that this beast holds a grudge?" Tang Yuxian felt her mind struggling to comprehend.

Tu Feng opened his mouth, then suddenly chuckled, "Indeed, he has surprised us. But if it's only like this... it's not enough."

Tang Yuxian nodded slightly.

To gain the heartfelt allegiance of the Blood Servants was not a simple task. Especially for Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, both exceptional experts of the Divine Roaming Realm, neither would easily submit to the transformation of a mere eagle.

After a long time, the Golden Feather Eagle slowly descended, landing gently about ten zhang above the ground. Yang Kai leaped off its back, and the eagle folded its wings, settling directly onto Yang Kai's shoulder, looking exceptionally obedient.

The hooked beak affectionately groomed Yang Kai's hair.

"You are impressive, Young Master." Tu Feng sincerely praised him.

Yang Kai scratched the Golden Feather Eagle's head and chuckled, "I offended it a few days ago. It took some effort to turn the foe into a friend."

"How did you do it?" Tang Yuxian asked curiously.

Yang Kai's expression turned serious, responding solemnly, "By sensing its heart, you can make it perceive your intentions; that is all."

Tang Yuxian blinked, suddenly finding it quite profound.

"Let’s go!" Yang Kai had no intention of flaunting, calling out as he mounted the Treading Cloud Steed.

In the days that followed, their pace was neither too fast nor too slow, but the relationship between the Golden Feather Eagle and Yang Kai grew increasingly intimate. This Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast could now clearly understand all of Yang Kai's commands, executing both simple and complex ones flawlessly.

The two Blood Servants were astonished by Yang Kai’s talent.

Even the individual from the Yang Family responsible for raising and training the Golden Feather Eagle probably lacked Yang Kai’s abilities.

If the young master were to fail in the succession battle, becoming a falcon trainer in the Yang Family would not be a bad life.

Yang Kai secretly chuckled; had it not been to subdue these two Blood Servants, he would not have gone to such lengths. A mere Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast could be tamed with a Slave Beast Seal, making it obedient without fuss.

Yet, he had to maintain this charade for several days, causing him considerable trouble.

Three days later.

In front of the Lingxiao Pavilion.

The entire Sect was in tatters, with broken walls and ruins.

The ground was scorched, with collapsed buildings scattered everywhere.

The earth groaned under the aftermath.

Yang Kai’s expression darkened, his mood heavy.

The Sect, which had flourished for hundreds of years, was now reduced to ruins. A few years ago, Yang Kai had felt little sense of belonging here. However, after all that had happened, he had come to regard this place as his own sect.

"This is your Sect, Young Master?" Tang Yuxian asked curiously as she looked at Yang Kai, unsure why it lay in such desolation, showing signs of having been wiped out.

Yang Kai dismounted from the Treading Cloud Steed, nodding slightly.

Tu Feng stepped forward, finding a large scorched plaque on the ground, casually lifting and flipping it over. Tang Yuxian leaned closer, filled with curiosity.

Last time, when she inquired about Yang Kai’s Sect affiliation, he had dodged the question, leaving her quite intrigued.

"Lingxiao..." Tu Feng muttered softly.

The plaque was burnt beyond recognition, the last character almost illegible, but both Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian had sufficient insight to recognize a possibility in an instant.

"Lingxiao Pavilion?" Tang Yuxian exclaimed, her pretty face filled with surprise, making eye contact with Tu Feng before hastily looking back at Yang Kai.

"Yes!" Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Both Blood Servants gasped, deeply moved!

The Lingxiao Pavilion was merely a second-rate Sect, yet it was now world-renowned!

It was the Sect descended from the evil lord!

Moreover, it was said that when the Qiu Family’s experts had come here before, they must have suffered a considerable loss.

The eldest daughter of the Qiu Family, Qiu Yimeng, had gone missing here, and so had Luo Xiaoman from Ziwei Valley and Bai Yunfeng from the Bai Family. Several Divine Roaming Realm experts had also been injured.

After that incident, the Qiu Family's experts spread word that there was a peak expert above Divine Roaming in the Lingxiao Pavilion.

Above Divine Roaming! No second-rate Sect had ever produced such a figure. With such a person holding sway, the Lingxiao Pavilion could easily become a first-rate power!

It was because of Qiu Yimeng’s disappearance that the Qiu Family’s experts angrily set fire to the Lingxiao Pavilion.

To this day, the eldest daughter of the Qiu Family still had no news.

As fellow members of the Eight Great Families, the two Blood Servants from the Yang Family were naturally well aware of this information.

Once they learned of Yang Kai’s Sect, the two Blood Servants were genuinely shaken.

Tu Feng stared blankly at the broken plaque. Not knowing whether to drop it or hold onto it, he rolled his eyes.

Yang Kai had already stepped inside.

"Be careful, Young Master; there are quite a few people inside," Tang Yuxian quickly warned.

"People?" Yang Kai paused, hurriedly extending his Divine Sense to investigate. Shortly after, his expression grew suspicious.

Indeed, there were people, and it appeared there were quite a few—at least over several hundred.

Doubtful, he looked inside and hastily walked in.

Not long after, he saw a bustling scene within the Lingxiao Pavilion. People moved about, all familiar faces—these were the original disciples of the Lingxiao Pavilion!

There were those from the younger generation, as well as from the previous one, all busy cleaning and restoring the remnants of their Sect.

It seemed they were trying to rebuild the Lingxiao Pavilion.

Yang Kai watched in bewilderment.

Because of the evil lord, the Lingxiao Pavilion had been deemed a demonic Sect. Before the calamity struck, Ling Taixu had dispersed ninety percent of the disciples, leaving only over a hundred to escape through the Void Passage.

How could there suddenly be so many people again? And they were making such a grand effort to start rebuilding.

Weren't they afraid the Qiu Family would come looking for trouble once more?

While he was lost in thought, a disciple of the Lingxiao Pavilion passing by suddenly halted, looking at him with surprise. "Yang Kai?"

Yang Kai turned his head and found it was Cao Zhengwen.

Originally a personal disciple of the Grand Elder, he had later been recruited by Bai Yunfeng of the Bai Family but, after suffering a severe injury from Yang Kai, Bai Yunfeng had ignored him. Cao Zhengwen had spent several months recuperating within the Sect before abandoning his ties to the Bai Family.

Since then, everyone in the Sect had treated him with some disdain.

"Senior Brother Cao!" Yang Kai casually called out.

Cao Zhengwen's face showed panic, and he took a few steps back. The last time Yang Kai severely wounded him in a flash; he had left a significant psychological scar. Now seeing Yang Kai, who seemed much stronger than before, he was understandably terrified.

Their exchange attracted the attention of many nearby.

Once the disciples of the Lingxiao Pavilion recognized Yang Kai, they all bore awkward expressions.

"Where is Yang Kai?" A low voice called out from nearby. Upon hearing it, Yang Kai instinctively narrowed his eyes.

Looking over, he saw a handsome young man striding toward him confidently, dressed in black tight-fitting clothes that accentuated his extraordinary figure, his eyes lightning-like, coldly staring at Yang Kai.

When he halted three zhang away from Yang Kai, he apathetically glanced at Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian. When his electric gaze landed on Tang Yuxian, it couldn't help but brighten slightly.

Then, he concealed his expression, raising his head to regard Yang Kai, a slight smile appearing at the corner of his mouth, "Junior Brother Yang, you’ve returned."

Yang Kai also smiled broadly, "Senior Brother Jie!"

Jie Hongchen, one of the core disciples of the Lingxiao Pavilion, had many entanglements with Yang Kai that couldn’t be counted.

"It’s good to be back." Jie Hongchen nodded, his demeanor calm, embodying the arrogance of a senior brother, and he spoke with a hint of disdain, "Since you're back, help us rebuild the Sect; we’re short on manpower here. It looks like you've grown quite a bit during your time outside. There are many areas here for you to showcase your talents, and you won’t be disappointed." 

Yang Kai furrowed his brows slightly.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian couldn’t help but express their astonishment, their expressions exceedingly strange.
