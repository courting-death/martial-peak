## Chapter 1950 — Ice Cliff

Yang Kai and Bian Yuqing had little contact; apart from this meeting, they had only met once before.

The first time Yang Kai saw Bian Yuqing he only felt the woman was powerful—after all, she cultivated at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—but as for her temperament, Yang Kai could not fathom it.

Yet this second meeting made Yang Kai understand that she was a woman given to caprice!

Not someone to be trifled with!

Her casual strike had not used overwhelming force, yet it was more than Yang Kai in his current state could withstand; after crashing into the wall he felt his Qi and blood churn and his chest bones ache faintly.

When he rose to his feet he happened to hear Bian Yuqing's coquettish laugh.

Yang Kai pressed his hand to his chest and focused, studying Bian Yuqing.

The latter's lovely eyes fixed on Yang Kai, a trace of approval in them; she inclined her forehead slightly and nodded, "This Lord likes men with backbone, you performed well—at least you did not disgrace this Lord's reputation!"

Yang Kai frowned and did not reply.

"However..." Bian Yuqing's tone shifted. "Today's matter could be grave or trivial; I do not wish to give Zhu Junshan an excuse to trouble this Lord. After all, you have only entered the sect a little over a month and yet dared to defy your superiors—this is due to my failure in instruction. Very well, you will go to the Ice Cliff and remain there for three months; today's matter will be considered closed."

She spoke casually, but Yang Kai felt uneasy and asked in a low voice, "May I ask, Protector, what is this Ice Cliff...?"

He had been in the Biyu Sect for over a month and truly had never heard of such a place as the Ice Cliff.

"The Ice Cliff..." Bian Yuqing smiled lightly, "Mm. It is where disciples who err are placed under confinement; the environment there... heh, you will just have to see it for yourself."

Yang Kai's face darkened.

Kou Wu glanced at him, eyes full of sympathy, as if the Ice Cliff were something very bad.

"Take him!" Bian Yuqing waved her hand nonchalantly and then closed her beautiful eyes again.

"Disciple takes his leave!" Kou Wu respectfully backed away, and as he left he gave Yang Kai a tug.

Yang Kai was full of questions, but seeing Bian Yuqing's expression he knew he could not ask anything and could only follow Kou Wu away.

Once outside Kou Wu finally exhaled softly; every time he met Bian Yuqing he felt enormous pressure.

"Senior Brother Kou..." Yang Kai turned to look at Kou Wu.

"Ah, Junior Brother Yang!" Kou Wu sighed, patted Yang Kai's shoulder and spoke earnestly, "Don't ask. Once you're there you'll understand. I can only say... the Protector has been unusually lenient this time; after all, three months is not long—just a short confinement and it will pass. When the time comes I'll personally come to fetch you."

Hearing him, Yang Kai felt worse, increasingly certain the Ice Cliff was no good place.

But unless he could now carve a bloody path out of the Biyu Sect, he could only obediently go with Kou Wu to the Ice Cliff.

After quietly calculating his strength, Yang Kai could only bury his frustration in his heart.

Kou Wu once again produced his tower-ship-shaped flying Secret Treasure; after the two boarded, the vessel sped off in a certain direction.

Looking down from above, the buildings of the Biyu Sect receded at an incredible speed.

The further they went, the more Yang Kai sensed the severe cold embedded in the air.

At one point Kou Wu suddenly pointed ahead and said, "Junior Brother Yang, that is the Ice Cliff; any disciple who errs and is to be confined is thrown there. Mm, don't think of escaping—though this place is distant from headquarters and ten thousand li around is uninhabited, if you leave the Ice Cliff without permission the Protector will surely know, and then..."

Kou Wu did not finish his sentence; Yang Kai understood his meaning, only nodding slightly and looking forward.

Somewhere ahead clouds swirled, obscuring the true scene; one could just make out a towering peak that seemed cleaved in two, the cut neat as if a gash in the heavens, a chasm that inspired awe.

By the time they arrived the cold in the air had become even more pronounced; even with the Secret Treasure's protection Yang Kai could feel a bone-piercing chill.

Within that cold there seemed mixed another aura that was familiar yet strange to him.

Yang Kai frowned and pondered at length, then suddenly murmured, "Imperial Might?"

Kou Wu looked astonished and said, "Junior Brother Yang, you can perceive Imperial Might here? Have you encountered an Emperor expert before?"

If one had not met an Emperor-level expert, one could not know what Imperial Might felt like. When Kou Wu first came here he only sensed the ice's oppressive chill as if it naturally suppressed martial artists, and he did not understand why until Bian Yuqing explained it to him.

And Yang Kai, who came from a low-grade Star Domain and cultivated at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, could in an instant judge that the severe cold concealed Imperial Might—this was not something mere eyesight could explain; the only possibility was that Yang Kai had previously felt Imperial Might, hence his recognition.

"Mm, in the Great Wilderness Star Domain there is a forbidden area where remnants of Imperial Might remain; I felt it before!" Yang Kai answered casually.

"I see!" Kou Wu did not doubt him and nodded, "Low-grade Star Domains often have guardians; each guardian is a high Emperor expert—perhaps your Great Wilderness domain's guardian left traces in that forbidden area."

"But how would Imperial Might be here?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Kou Wu smiled slightly, "This relates to the Ice Cliff's origin. Rumor says the Ice Cliff's birth is tied to an Emperor expert who could command the laws of ice; that cliff was split by that expert's sword, and the area's surroundings are suffused with that Emperor's ice profound intent, lingering for ten thousand years. Otherwise, why would the Ice Cliff be used by our Biyu Sect as a place to confine disciples?"

"So it was created by an Emperor's sword?" Yang Kai's eyes lit up.

"That's what people in the sect say, though whether true I can't confirm," Kou Wu chuckled. "When you get there, stay on the surface and do not go deep. The deeper you go the stronger that Emperor's ice profound intent becomes; even the Sect Master and the four Protectors cannot penetrate to the bottom. With your ability you cannot contend with Imperial Might—venturing in would be fraught with danger."

"I understand, thank you for telling me, Senior Brother!" Yang Kai nodded.

Kou Wu spoke earnestly and admonished him, "Also, the Protector's confinement is not purely punishment. Though the Ice Cliff's environment is harsh and few can endure long, if one can comprehend something there one will reap boundless benefit. Do not squander the Protector's intention."

Yang Kai grinned, "Is that so? In that case, Senior Brother, don't go back—let's go together and try to comprehend the Martial Dao!"

Kou Wu's expression turned serious and fear showed in his eyes, "No! That damned place—I once came and stayed a month and nearly couldn't return."

"What cultivation were you at when you came then?" Yang Kai asked.

"Third Stage of the Void King Realm!" Kou Wu answered.

Yang Kai immediately smirked, "The Protector really values me, huh."

Kou Wu gave a light chuckle, formed a hand-seal, and the tower-ship ground to a halt. He looked at Yang Kai and said, "Senior Brother, I'll escort you this far — go on by yourself. I'll come back to fetch you in three months!"

Yang Kai nodded, said nothing more, leapt from the Secret Treasure and charged toward the Ice Cliff's summit.

After Yang Kai departed, Kou Wu hurriedly drove the vessel away as if fleeing the damned place.

......

The bone-piercing cold seemed to reach into the depths of the soul, not only obstructing the smooth circulation of one's inner power but even affecting thought, giving the illusion that the mind itself was freezing.

Steam from his breath rose thick like fog. When Yang Kai touched down upon the very top of the Ice Cliff he involuntarily circulated his strength to resist the pervasive cold and felt somewhat relieved.

The space atop the Ice Cliff was broad, like a level plain, and near the rock face there were pits of various sizes.

They were clearly crude cave dwellings carved out by confined Biyu Sect disciples over the years.

Yang Kai stood in place and surveyed the area.

He found the Ice Cliff's summit barren and extremely desolate; even the rock had been frozen into ice.

There was also a faint trace of Imperial Might here, containing a very profound ice-cold law, but it was not strong, so with Yang Kai's current strength resisting it was relatively easy.

"If Su Yan were here..." Yang Kai's mind suddenly filled with Su Yan's lovely figure.

If she had been here, the Ice Cliff would not be an unbearable prison but a boon—suffused with an Emperor's ice-cold profound intent and the ice law, it would enormously accelerate her cultivation. If she could glimpse the law's mysteries and condense her own profound intent, it would greatly shorten her path to advancement.

Unfortunately, Su Yan remained on Dark Star.

And Yang Kai himself did not cultivate ice-cold attribute power, so he could only look on and sigh.

He shook his head, dispelled the longing and disorder from his mind, acquainted himself with the empty, desolate environment, then moved to the rock face and entered the caves to begin his inspection.

Since he would be here for three months he naturally had to determine whether there were any living people here; if any fellow disciples were confined here it would be best to at least greet them.

After searching, Yang Kai confirmed there was not a single living person here—only himself!

But there were about a dozen dead.

Those dozen corpses were scattered in different caves, each sitting cross-legged as if in meditation, looking strikingly lifelike; their expressions at death were extremely peaceful, as if they had suffered no torment but rather lost their lives in slumber.
