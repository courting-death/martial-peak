## Chapter 1760 — Spirit Flower

Zi Long pondered for a moment before finally speaking. “Mm. The Immortal Source Liquid is a dewdrop formed from countless years of accumulated essence on the leaves of the Unaging Tree. Using it for something like regenerating severed limbs would be a waste of its true potential. It is a naturally formed Spiritual Pill, capable of bringing the dead back to life!”

“Bring the dead back to life!” Zi Donglai exclaimed in horror. “If such an effect comes from merely the dew, then the Everlasting Tree itself—”

“Hmph. If one could obtain the Everlasting Tree and refine it, one could attain an undying, imperishable body and live as long as heaven itself!”

“What?” Zi Donglai was truly shocked now. Even as the Young Master of the Purple Star, his mind trembled; he could hardly believe such words—especially coming from his own father.

“If I could attain endless life, then your father could accomplish feats unprecedented and unmatched. I would surpass the Void King Realm and glimpse the mysteries of the Emperor’s domain!” Zi Long said, his whole being suffused with excitement and fanatic fervor.

Zi Donglai stared at his father in a daze; he had not seen him wear such an expression in a long time, which showed how overwhelming the Everlasting Tree’s temptation was to his father.

“Father, is this news known only to our Purple Star?” Zi Donglai asked again.

“No!” Zi Long shook his head, a trace of apprehension appearing on his face. “I can’t be sure about everyone, but the Hengluo Commerce Guild certainly knows of the Everlasting Tree. Two thousand years ago your great-uncle entered with the previous guild head. So… that old dog Ni Guang is probably here for the Everlasting Tree as well.”

Zi Donglai’s brow knit in suspicion. “If that’s the case, why didn’t you assemble more experts?”

Zi Long smiled slightly. “This isn’t something solved by numbers, and… there is only one Everlasting Tree. If we succeed, to whom would it belong? In the face of such a supreme treasure, you can trust only yourself; everyone else… is an enemy.”

Zi Donglai considered this and nodded. “Your son has learned his lesson.”

“Yes, you’re still young. The road ahead is long. I brought you in this time to temper you, to let you face dangers you can’t imagine so you grow faster. Don’t let me down.”

“I will strive for it!” Zi Donglai replied in a low voice.

As master of the Purple Star, Zi Long had countless children, yet he favored Zi Donglai above the rest. Among so many offspring, this child had stood out, and of course he would cultivate him carefully.

Zi Donglai well understood this and had worked all the harder over the years, never daring to slack in his cultivation.

Entering the Lost Realm this time was extremely dangerous, but it was a fine test. If he passed it, his position in the Purple Star would be unassailable.

Zi Donglai secretly clenched his fist, resolved to perform well this time.

…

At the same time, far away, Ni Guang led Yang Kai and two others as they advanced through the Lost Realm.

They had encountered no great peril along the way. Nor had they found any notable gain; the Lost Realm seemed somewhat overrated.

However, Ni Guang produced an object that greatly interested Yang Kai and the others.

It was a secret treasure resembling a Transmission Compass, but different: its disc contained a pointer-like device that Ni Guang had taken out two hours earlier and carried in his hand, swinging it from side to side.

As it swung, the pointer occasionally made subtle changes, and whenever it did, Ni Guang would alter course and head in another direction.

Luo Lan was baffled and didn’t know what marvel the secret treasure possessed. She guessed in private that it might avoid certain dangers, but it was a private matter and she refrained from asking, keeping it to herself.

Yang Kai, however, was astonished. He discovered the treasure could detect the positions of some hidden spatial rifts.

Whenever the pointer pointed in a direction, Yang Kai could sense obscure spatial fluctuations from that side, and Ni Guang always managed to avoid them in time.

It was plainly a specially crafted secret treasure made for entering the Lost Realm. The one who forged it had very likely cultivated Spatial Force!

Yang Kai guessed as much; the Hengluo Commerce Guild was a vast power that produced many talents, so someone there cultivating spatial power was only natural.

From how the treasure reacted, Yang Kai keenly inferred that the forger’s attainments in spatial power were far inferior to his own.

That treasure could not detect every hidden spatial rift.

Some rifts would be just a dozen zhang away yet produce no reaction from it, while Yang Kai could clearly sense them. Whenever that happened, his heart raced, fearing Ni Guang would rush forward.

Fortunately, the journey had been alarming but without real danger, and Yang Kai had no need to reveal his secret to warn Ni Guang to change course.

In the void, marks like torn scars sometimes appeared—spatial rifts visible to the naked eye.

Such things were like scars across the sky, forever marring the void and adding to the Lost Realm’s sense of peril.

As they pushed forward, whether obvious or hidden, the number of rifts only increased.

They even saw a chasm-like rift spanning the void, from which came horrific, strange fluctuations; no one knew what lay on the other side.

When Yang Kai saw that rift, his eyes lit with eagerness.

He distinctly felt that within that vast spatial fissure might hide what he needed—the Ethereal Crystal nurtured in the void or the insight into spatial power he craved. He believed charging in would yield great gain.

But he was currently traveling with Ni Guang and the others and did not rashly leave the group; they merely brushed past the rift. After all, the Lost Realm held many such opportunities, so there was no need to rush.

“Eh…” Ni Guang, who was walking ahead, suddenly stopped and looked in a direction, emitting a sound of surprise.

Following his gaze, the other three saw a person lying on the ground about a hundred zhang away.

“This is…” Luo Lan whispered. “The clothing looks familiar—could he be someone who entered with us earlier?”

“Looks like it.” Ni Guang’s expression turned grave as he sent out his Divine Sense to probe; his face changed. “But he seems to be dead.”

Luo Lan’s pretty face went pale. Among the warriors who had entered the Lost Realm earlier, aside from Yang Kai, Xue Yue, and Zi Donglai, the rest were Void King Realm, none inferior to her.

Yet in only a few hours she had come upon someone’s corpse here.

It was hard to imagine what attack this person had suffered. With Void King Realm strength, he had still died here, and from the nearby conditions it looked as if he had not fought—he had been ambushed and killed instantly.

Putting herself in his place, Luo Lan felt her own fate might not be any better.

She began to count herself lucky.

“Should we go take a look?” Xue Yue considered and pointed toward the corpse. “There seems to be something beside him.”

Without her pointing it out, everyone had noticed. Beside the Void King Realm expert’s corpse lay a small flower like a cockscomb, standing upright from the ground; even a hundred zhang away, the scent it gave off drifted over.

The fragrance refreshed the spirit and eased the group’s tense mood.

“What kind of Spiritual Herb is this? Does anyone recognize it?” Ni Guang asked.

Luo Lan shook her head awkwardly, and Xue Yue likewise didn’t know. Even Yang Kai, a Void King-Grade alchemist, looked baffled.

He truly had never seen such a herb. After all, inside the Imperial Garden he had obtained the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy, which recorded countless lost formulas and countless strange flowers and herbs—almost everything. He considered his understanding of herbs no worse than anyone in the Star Domain.

Yet Yang Kai found no similar record in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

Ni Guang frowned and pondered a moment. “I’ll go take a look. Stay here and don’t move.”

Brimming with boldness from his skill, he did not want to give up the opportunity. Whatever the herb was, there lay a Void King Realm expert’s corpse nearby; obtaining the other’s Spatial Ring would be a fine gain.

“Shall I go with you?” Luo Lan asked.

Ni Guang glanced at her and nodded. “Then be careful.”

“I will.” Luo Lan smiled and the two of them slowly approached.

Yang Kai and Xue Yue stayed where they were, nervously watching the situation.

A hundred zhang away, the two soon neared, but to everyone’s surprise no danger arose as Ni Guang and Luo Lan drew close to the corpse.

Ni Guang, puzzled, peered at the body and gasped softly: “This person was ambushed from behind—there are two bite marks on the back of the neck. It looks like a serpent-type demonic beast, and its venom is deadly!”

Luo Lan nodded; she had noticed as well. Because the corpse lay face down, the condition of the nape was clear.

It was imaginable that the man had been bitten unawares on the nape and immediately died, hence his prone posture.

This was simply a venom that killed upon contact with blood—even a Void King Realm cultivator would be powerless to resist it.

“Elder Luo, please take the body with you; I’ll pick the Spirit Flower,” Ni Guang instructed.

“Very well.” Luo Lan nodded, taking no chances; rather than touching the body directly she cast a Saint Yuan to wrap it, then quickly retreated outward.
