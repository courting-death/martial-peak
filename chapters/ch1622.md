## Chapter 1622 — Hiding

Fortunately, these pills were all personally concocted by Yang Kai, each one of exceptionally high quality; upon ingestion they transformed within moments into surges of heat that flooded his limbs and bones, patching up the losses to his Saint Yuan and Divine Sense.

Qian Tong had already been sealed inside the Xuan Realm Pearl; he had taken a blow from Luo Hai and suffered some injuries — not grave, but at the moment it was undoubtedly best not to let him show his face.

If he were to be suppressed by Luo Hai and his Realm were to fall, Qian Tong would be destined to regret it for life!

After all, he had only just broken through to the Void King Realm and had not yet had time to stabilize it.

In terms of cultivation, Yang Kai was now inferior to Qian Tong, but when it came to fleeing, Yang Kai was confident he would not lose to anyone.

His speed was already extreme; his Wind-and-Thunder Wings unfurled behind him, streaking through the Star Domain like lightning.

Yet Luo Hai seemed even faster — a distance of ten thousand li was closed in merely the time it took to drink a cup of tea.

A thick, heavy pressure pressed in from behind; Yang Kai immediately understood that Luo Hai was not far off.

"Boy, cooperate obediently with me and I may spare your life! Persist in your obstinacy and don’t blame me for being merciless!" Luo Hai's threatening voice rang clearly in Yang Kai's ears.

Yang Kai paid him no heed and kept fleeing; against such an opponent he had no intention to fight — only endless flight offered the faintest hope of survival.

"You're courting death'!" Luo Hai, seeing Yang Kai unmoved, flew into a rage; five hundred li away, he suddenly extended a hand and sent forth a hair-thin beam of energy that pierced space itself and, with terrifying speed, shot toward Yang Kai.

Feeling the murderous intent from behind, Yang Kai gritted his teeth and unleashed Spatial Force; he thrust both hands into the void and tore it open to either side.

A void rift immediately appeared before him.

Yang Kai stepped through with a single stride and vanished in the blink of an eye. The next moment, that strange attack struck the spot where he had been, tearing through the illusory shadow he had left behind.

"A spatial rift!" Luo Hai exclaimed in astonishment; his figure flickered and he arrived where Yang Kai had disappeared, intending to follow and plunge into that chaotic tear.

But Yang Kai had clearly not given him the chance. The spatial rift sealed up at once.

"The brat is proficient in spatial force!" Luo Hai said, incredulous.

At his level of cultivation, Luo Hai was seldom moved by anything — and yet Yang Kai had several times left him stunned.

First the Imperial Treasure, then the casual rending of space — just how monstrous was this brat?

The Imperial Treasure mattered little; it simply showed Yang Kai's deep fortune, where he had obtained it was unknown. But casually ripping space apart like that — even Luo Hai had never heard of such a thing.

In the entire Star Domain there were countless martial artists, and a few cultivated Spatial Force, but those Luo Hai knew of had only dabbled — they knew how to repair a Space Array, nothing more.

Who could casually tear open space?

"Is that your trump card? No wonder you dared act insolently before me!" Luo Hai's face darkened as he snorted lowly. "But if you think that alone will let you escape my palm, you're deluding yourself."

As his words fell, a terrifying Divine Sense spread wildly in all directions.

In barely three breaths his eyes flashed and he turned to look in a direction. "There — he's fleeing fast; he's already five thousand li away!"

Drawing a deep breath, Luo Hai's Saint Yuan surged. Like a meteor he shot off in that direction, closing on Yang Kai with incredible speed.

Five thousand li away, Yang Kai had only just caught his breath when he keenly sensed a Divine Sense locking onto him like a maggot to the bone, impossible to shake.

Turning back, he saw a streak of light in the distant starry sky approaching.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and once more tore at the void.

Moments later Luo Hai tracked to this spot and halted; he expanded his Divine Sense a second time, searching for Yang Kai's position; once perceived, he resumed pursuit.

They fled and chased, the distance at times widening, at times closing, the tension suffocating.

Yang Kai knew he absolutely could not fall into Luo Hai's hands — the consequences would be unthinkable.

Time passed; in the blink of an eye it was half a month.

Luo Hai, who had once been calm and confident with victory in hand, no longer wore that expression; it was replaced by boundless ferocity and fury.

He had assumed that even if Yang Kai were proficient with spatial force, he could not possibly escape his palm.

Spatial Force was indeed mysterious; those who studied it were hard to kill — but compared to him, Yang Kai's cultivation was far too low!

Ripping open space once consumed vast Saint Yuan and monstrous amounts of Divine Sense — how much exactly Luo Hai did not know, but he was certain the cost was not small. He only needed to dog Yang Kai from afar; once Yang Kai weakened, that would be the moment to seize him.

That was his calculation!

What astonished him beyond measure was that in these half month Yang Kai had torn open space at least two hundred times, each time escaping two to three thousand li, and as time passed the distances he opened grew ever greater — being pressed like this seemed to refine Yang Kai's command of Spatial Force.

The brat showed no sign of exhaustion!

Where did he get so much Saint Yuan to squander? Where did he get such potent Divine Sense to power it? Even taking Spiritual Pills could not sustain such prolonged flight.

Luo Hai could not fathom it!

Yet he did not give up; he was convinced his guess was right — Yang Kai would stop sooner or later.

Luo Hai's guess was not entirely wrong; each time Yang Kai tore open space he paid mighty Saint Yuan and huge Divine Sense — over this half month he was nearly spent.

Saint Yuan could be replenished by rupturing his Golden Blood, which would immediately flood him with power.

But Divine Sense was different; its consumption was terrifying and its recovery slow. Without a supreme treasure like the Warm Spirit Lotus, Yang Kai would long since have been unable to continue.

Even so, he had been driven to the end of his tether!

He swallowed Pill after Pill; the Spiritual Pills he had refined to restore Divine Sense were nearly exhausted.

Yang Kai had no choice but to consume herbs that aided recovery of Divine Sense.

Although it wasted resources and the herbs' medicinal power could not be fully utilized, survival mattered more than thrift — Yang Kai had no time for such considerations.

Repeatedly pushing his limits, Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness unknowingly expanded; his Divine Sense grew firmer and more consolidated.

His command over Spatial Force likewise grew purer still.

Yang Kai had not noticed; all his focus was on how to break free of Luo Hai's tracking.

After thinking it through, there was only one plan.

He would hide inside the Xuan Realm Pearl himself! But that was too risky — if Luo Hai discovered him inside, he would be a frog in a jar.

He dared not do it unless absolutely necessary!

Another five days passed.

The two of them streaked through the Star Domain, running an unknown distance; yet Luo Hai clung like a leech, never far behind. Whenever Yang Kai tore space to gain distance, Luo Hai could close the gap in very little time.

A Void King Realm expert was this troublesome!

His Sea of Consciousness was nearly dry. The herbs could not replenish the consumed Divine Sense — at most he had three more chances before complete exhaustion.

Biting down, Yang Kai tore open space once more and dove through; the next moment he had appeared several thousand li away.

Without pause, Yang Kai tore again...

A third time...

In an instant he had put ten thousand li between himself and Luo Hai.

Pale as paper, he looked round and immediately descended onto a nearby massive meteor.

The meteor was roughly several hundred li across, like a mountain.

Upon reaching it, Yang Kai found an exceedingly concealed spot, took out the Xuan Realm Pearl, and hid it within a crevice of the meteor. With a shift of his figure he slipped into the Small Xuan Realm.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm there was peace.

Friends and relatives brought from the Tongxuan Continent had long since been living here in safety.

Here the world was detached from strife and Spiritual Qi was rich; aside from the incompleteness of the heavens-and-earth laws, it was virtually a paradise.

The Small Xuan Realm now hosted many pavilion-like buildings spread across a hundred-li radius; in each pavilion martial artists sat in meditation and closed their doors to cultivate.

These pavilions had been built by those from the Tongxuan Continent. The Small Xuan Realm had mountains, water, grass and trees — they used local materials and so it was quite convenient.

Humans, yao and demons coexisted harmoniously, with no disputes.

Everyone cherished the life they now had.

The cultivation conditions here were far superior to those on the Tongxuan Continent; almost ninety-nine percent of people had broken through here and advanced in their cultivation.

Meng Wuya, Chu Lingxiao, Ling Taixu, Di Mo, Changyuan, and the Great Yao Lord Lei Long...

These veteran Third Stage of the Saint Realm practitioners had one after another broken through to the Saint King Realm.

Although the laws of the Small Xuan Realm were not complete, they were sufficient for these people to advance, for the Saint King Realm was not exceedingly powerful.

When Yang Kai appeared here, the Small Xuan Realm was utterly silent.

No one detected his arrival.

Forcing himself, enduring the pounding pain in his head, he released his Divine Sense to probe.

Soon he sensed Xia Ningshang's location; with a flicker he arrived at the second floor of a pavilion.

Xia Ningshang seemed to be refining Pills; her face was veiled in black silk and she concentrated on her alchemy, an invisible radiance surrounding her that made her both mysterious and dignified. Though her features could not be clearly seen, the outline of her face alone could send any man's spirit into turmoil.

Yang Kai's arrival startled her. Perceiving his weakened aura, her expression changed; she rushed to support him and cried out, "Junior Brother, what happened to you? Who struck you?"

"It's nothing, I ran into a strong enemy who is chasing me," Yang Kai attempted to smile and reassure Xia Ningshang, but could not manage a laugh.

Xia Ningshang's expression shifted; she did not ask further — she knew that anyone capable of pressing Yang Kai to such a state must be at least a Void King Realm cultivator!

She understood Yang Kai's combat might; in the Red Moon palace even a powerhouse like Xue Lian had not been Yang Kai's match. If he was in such a desperate state now, who besides a Void King Realm expert could have done it?

Xia Ningshang bit her lip, eyes moist, her heart wrenching with worry.
