## Chapter 1754 — Lost Realm

"Without you, this entrance could still be opened, it would only require waiting for a few more people," Ni Guang said calmly. "But since you have come, there is no need to wait."

"If that's the case, then get to it," Zi Long chuckled.

Hearing their conversation, Yang Kai immediately knew who the newcomers were.

The purple-haired man, who possessed the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, was none other than the master of Purple Star, Zi Long!

Once that was clear, the other man's identity also became obvious―the young master of Purple Star, Zi Donglai.

Yang Kai knew of Zi Donglai because Gu Jianxin had mentioned him in passing; Gu Jianxin had listed Zi Donglai alongside Xue Yue, implicitly acknowledging Zi Donglai's formidable strength.

These three young talents were the most famous trio in the entire Star Domain, for they represented three different great forces, and each was the future successor of their respective faction.

Beneath them were many other young-generation experts whose reputations also spread far and wide.

For example, Wudao's disciple Xu Binbai, Shan Qingluo on Di Chen Star, and the heirs of several yao lords—none of them were as illustrious as the three, however.

Yet there was no denying that the Star Domain's future would be dominated by these people.

Yang Kai did not know exactly what grudge or rivalry stood between Zi Donglai and Xue Yue, or whether it was merely youthful competitiveness; in any case, whenever the two met they both wore looks of barely restrained eagerness, as if they longed to fight right then and there.

But it was obviously not a good time for that.

Zi Long's arrival made it possible to carry out the entrance-opening; thus Ni Guang and Zi Long naturally took charge, calling on all Void King Realm experts to begin contributing energy.

After a brief discussion, the Void King Realm experts present scattered, each taking up a position near the entrance and centering their minds to wait.

"Then... shall we begin?" Zi Long directed his gaze at Ni Guang and asked.

Ni Guang nodded slightly, and in the next moment a surging flow of Saint Yuan erupted from his body as his hands formed complex seals; then he pointed forward with a single hand.

A visible pillar of energy shot forth from his hand and surged into the white, circular entrance.

Zi Long laughed heartily as he drove his own Saint Yuan into the entrance.

The other Void King Realm experts followed suit; even the figure who had been shrouded in black gas and kept his face hidden—whose origins were highly suspicious—did not lag and cooperated with the others.

The white, luminous entrance emitted a humming sound as the space rifts that had been drifting at the entrance seemed to be bound by an invisible force, frozen in place.

The entrance itself seemed to become a bottomless pit, greedily and frantically devouring the Saint Yuan of the Void King Realm experts.

Of all those present, only Yang Kai, Xue Yue, and Zi Donglai—three Origin Returning Realm cultivators—did not participate and remained on the sidelines.

After all, no matter how outstanding their talents or how deep their foundations, they were still somewhat inferior to Void King Realm experts at the fundamental level; in such a forced attempt to open the Lost Realm entrance, their contribution would be negligible, so it was better to preserve their strength to deal with the dangers that might await inside.

Time slowly passed.

Each Void King Realm expert's face showed strain as they continuously poured Saint Yuan into the entrance, exhausting themselves.

Fortunately, they had prepared many Spiritual Pills to recover Saint Yuan, and at this moment they all took them.

The differences in cultivation were now plain to see.

Those at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, like Luo Lan and Cui Hong, had beads of sweat on their brows and trembled slightly; only Second Stage experts like Ni Guang and Zi Long managed to remain composed.

More and more space rifts were fixed at the entrance, and as Saint Yuan was poured in the fluctuations of those rifts gradually subsided, showing signs of stabilization.

Watching this, Yang Kai roughly understood how everyone would enter the Lost Realm.

Indeed, when the number of stabilized space rifts at the white, circular entrance reached a certain amount, Ni Guang suddenly shouted, "It's ready!"

At his shout, all the Void King Realm experts ceased; each chose a different space rift, transformed into streaks of light, and rushed into the entrance in a headlong scramble.

After they went in, the stabilized space rifts suddenly stirred and began to roam and weave.

Ni Guang and Luo Lan stood side by side and waved Yang Kai and Xue Yue over; when the two flew over, each of them wrapped one in Saint Yuan and charged toward a large space rift.

Purple light flashed and Zi Long's laughter rang out: "Brother Ni, I'll go ahead first—don't you dare die in there!"

With that, Zi Long took Zi Donglai and vanished into the entrance.

Ni Guang snorted coldly and then plunged in as well.

In an instant the once-populated void was empty.

Once everyone had disappeared, the entrance began to twist and change, and more and more space rifts appeared, growing increasingly dangerous; one could imagine that even if as many Void King Realm experts as before arrived, they would be unable to open the entrance again.

To enter again, they would have to wait for another chance, and who knew how many years or months that might be.

After Yang Kai followed Luo Lan into the space rift, he felt weightless, as if falling into an endless abyss; his Divine Sense felt great pressure—typical signs of spatial transmission.

He sensed Luo Lan was exerting power to resist pressure from all directions, but such transmission meant little to him; being well-versed in spatial forces, he was used to this kind of pressure.

The transit was quick; one moment they entered the entrance, and the next the scenery of another world appeared before Yang Kai's eyes.

The sky was dim and seemed filled with surging chaotic forces; there was no sun, no moon, no stars. The land was barren and dry, bereft of grass, cleft by ravine-like fissures.

They appeared in midair, so they involuntarily fell downward upon arriving.

Yang Kai turned and saw Ni Guang, Xue Yue, and Luo Lan were all with him.

The others, however, were not in the same place.

That was understandable; they had not entered through the same space rift, and each rift likely corresponded to a different arrival point.

Exerting Saint Yuan, the four floated down, and Ni Guang and Luo Lan both showed expressions of relief.

"Luckily, we didn't encounter danger right away," Luo Lan said softly, and even the powerful Ni Guang nodded in agreement, feeling they had been fortunate.

Those Void King Realm experts who had previously entered the Lost Realm had never found it smooth sailing; not only did it harbor many dangers that even Void King Realm experts could not easily dispel, but the hazards encountered immediately upon entry could also keep ordinary Void King Realm experts on their toes.

If they ran into some especially ferocious demonic beast, they might fall here.

Here, Ninth-Tier Demonic Beasts could be found everywhere, Tenth-Tier Demonic Beasts were as numerous as oxen in a herd, and there were even rumors of legendary Eleventh-Tier and Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beasts…

Fortunately, the four had decent luck.

After landing, Yang Kai perceived how different this place was from the Star Domain.

The strength of the world's laws here seemed extraordinarily powerful; his Saint Yuan and Divine Sense were unaffected, but the power of Shi was suppressed.

He tried to unleash Shi, but found its effectiveness was cut by at least half.

Sensing his movement, Xue Yue said from the side, "Don't bother; everyone is like this. It's not only our Shi—Uncle Ni's Domain will be suppressed as well. The law force here is vast and profound, and it affects Shi and Domains to varying degrees."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, his expression relaxing a little.

Ni Guang scanned the surroundings with his Divine Sense and, after confirming nothing could threaten them, turned to Luo Lan and asked, "Elder Luo, what do you intend to do next?"

Luo Lan was taken aback and asked doubtfully, “Senior Ni, what do you mean by that?”

Ni Guang pondered briefly and said, "Put it this way: the reason I invited you is because the Third Young Master wants this young man to stay by his side; Elder Luo, you are not under consideration. Before entering I could not speak plainly, but now that we're in, I want to ask: will you act with us from now on, or go your own way? But let me make this clear—this young man will remain with me."

He did not know why Xue Yue insisted on keeping Yang Kai, but he well understood Xue Yue's character and knew the Third Young Master would not act without reason.

If Xue Yue wanted Yang Kai kept, then there must be a reason.

Seeing Luo Lan contemplating, Ni Guang said, "With us your safety will be far greater, though I cannot promise you'll gain any benefits; if you go alone the risks are higher, but if you manage to obtain something here it will not have been in vain."

His words meant that even if he found something valuable, he would not share it with Luo Lan unless he needed her cooperation, in which case the rewards would be distributed according to contribution.

"I understand," Luo Lan nodded. "However... I still wish to stay with you. After all, Yang Kai is the one I brought here, so I cannot abandon him."

She dared not act alone without Yang Kai.

Before learning that Yang Kai was adept in spatial power, Luo Lan had not even planned to come to the Lost Realm; although she had heard of it, she could not be certain she would survive here by herself.

It was only upon learning of Yang Kai's spatial skill that she made the spur-of-the-moment decision to come.

For that reason, she would not part from Yang Kai under any circumstance.

Seeing her choice, Ni Guang did not look too surprised and said, "Very well, then travel together. Elder Luo, what is your main purpose in coming here?"

Luo Lan glanced at Yang Kai and pursed her lips into a smile. "Nothing particular, just going with the flow."

She dared not reveal the matter of the Jingkong Beast to Ni Guang, for his shrewdness would surely lead him to speculate;
