## Chapter 962 — The Secret of the Starry Sky

In the blink of an eye, the Four Great Demon Generals and Meng Wuya had darted to the prow of that great ship, about to step aboard, when suddenly a dense, almost tangible tide of demonic murderous qi erupted from some place on the vessel.

The Four Great Demon Generals felt a shoving force strike them in the face and each screamed as they were thrown backward; even Meng Wuya was slapped aside, tumbling through the air to land beside Yang Kai, his expression full of dread as he stared at the ruined ship.

Over there, a pitch-black energy like thick ink suddenly condensed and spawned; it was so dense it seemed corporeal, hovering in midair and constantly writhing and shifting.

"The aura of the Great Demon God!" Yang Kai shouted, a deep wariness flooding his face.

“The aura of the Demon God?” Changyuan cried out in shock, his eyes blazing with fanaticism. At once he burst into wild laughter: “I knew it—there’s no way this place could be as simple as just a single broken ship!”

Saying so, he stared intently at that mass of energy, hoping to glean anything at all; even the slightest discovery would justify his coming.

Feeling the sheer might and surging pressure of that aura, everyone took rigid battle positions.

After a moment, the writhing black energy coalesced into a human-shaped silhouette; though blurred, Yang Kai could still make out the outline of the Great Demon God.

The figure paused only an instant in midair before lunging straight at them.

As it drew near, each person felt their strength frozen as if shackled, unable to move; with shocked hearts they watched it pass through their bodies, then it burst apart into a plume of black mist and vanished.

At the same time, everyone felt as if something new had entered their minds; they instinctively closed their eyes to probe.

In that white, boundless space the group stood motionless, each probing with spirit to trace the impressions the dark figure had left after passing through their flesh; their faces gradually reflected a myriad of emotions.

Yang Kai was no different—when he sank into his spirit he suddenly realized his soul no longer resided within his Sea of Consciousness but had been transported to a vast Starry Sky.

Stars speckled the surroundings. Beneath his feet lay an abyss, and an expert radiating golden light was racing across the Starry Sky; his gaze was firm, his body mighty, his bearing imperious without anger. He used no secret treasure to guard himself, nor did he circulate any inner power—relying solely on his physical defenses, he strolled through the Starry Sky as if on a leisurely wander.

That was the Great Demon God!

Yang Kai's spirit shook violently. He instantly understood what the black figure had poured into his Sea of Consciousness.

It was, unmistakably, the Great Demon God's recorded experience of exploring the Starry Sky!

That legendary figure had left behind the things he encountered in the Starry Sky here, for later generations.

Yang Kai, however, was merely an outsider—he could only watch silently at a distance, unable to intervene in anything the Great Demon God had undergone.

He was confident the others were in the same position.

They promptly focused their attention, determined not to miss a single detail.

The scene connected with the patterns they had seen in the corridor—after countless lonely years, the Great Demon God finally embarked on a path to explore the Starry Sky.

He had no destination; he drifted like a falling leaf, blown by the winds through the boundless Starry Sky.

He had encountered a starry sky storm and passed through it without the slightest harm—his strength was truly astonishing.

He came upon a sea of meteorites, sat cross-legged atop one rock, and allowed the meteorite to carry him through the Starry Sky.

After an unknown length of time, the Great Demon God seated on the meteorite suddenly opened his eyes and stared blankly toward a certain direction.

Following his gaze, Yang Kai's eyes narrowed.

He saw a colossal ship sailing through the Starry Sky, and the ship's hull was exactly the same as the wrecked vessel they had just seen.

The Great Demon God's eyes brightened with excitement, and when the great ship departed he followed silently behind it.

He intended to hitch a ride on that ship to reach more wondrous realms, there to seek deeper martial Dao.

To the Great Demon God's surprise, however, the Starry Sky vessel seemed to have encountered trouble; it too appeared lost within the Starry Sky.

He trailed it for years with no gains, continuing to drift through the Starry Sky.

Until one day the vessel suddenly changed course as if it had found something, charging toward a certain planet.

The Great Demon God returned!

Following the Starry Sky ship to that planet, the Great Demon God realized, to his astonishment, that it was the Tongxuan Continent—the very world he had once left!

After drifting the Starry Sky for untold years while tailing that vessel, the Great Demon God ultimately returned to the place he had departed from.

The great ship was moored somewhere within the Demon Domain, and from it disembarked many visitors from beyond the stars. Among them were some whose eyes glimmered green like ghostly flames, some with a single horn sprouting from their foreheads, others with long, pointed ears, though the majority looked no different from humans.

Each one of them was overwhelmingly powerful; even the weakest among them had reached the Transcendent Realm.

The few leading them had even surpassed the level of the Saint Realm.

Upon their arrival the Demon Domain was immediately engulfed in war; demon generals attempted to stop them, but a peak Third Stage of the Saint Realm demon general was as frail as an ant before these visitors from beyond the stars—one green-eyed warrior casually struck and annihilated him, leaving no remains!

On a high peak, the experts from beyond the stars stood atop the summit, looking down on the Tongxuan Continent and pointing out its lands—they brimmed with arrogance, convinced their might alone could enslave this weak world!

The Great Demon God would not yield; he led the entire Demon Race to battle against them.

The scene shifted to a battlefield as brutal as Shura’s Purgatory. The Great Demon God's Golden Body was stained with blood as he slew enemy after enemy, leaving them in mangled heaps.

Blood flowed across the ground; corpses piled like mountains.

Ancient demons whose faces were etched with Demon Marks swore to follow the Great Demon God to the death, using their bodies and lives to shield him from attack again and again.

The Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace fought side by side against the mighty Bone Race—dragon and phoenix brought auspicious might.

Countless experts from the Ice Sect, by a single thought, let snowflakes fall and froze three thousand lands.

The two pavilion masters of Twin Pavilion, united as one, performed the Consonant Spirit Technique together and rose to an even greater level of power.

There was also a Great Lord of the yao, whose yao qi ran rampant.

Heaven and earth changed color before them.

In that battle the visitors from beyond the stars were all exterminated; none survived.

The battlefield was strewn with corpses; the Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress were nowhere to be found, the Twin Pavilion masters had also gone missing, a number of Great Yao Lords lay dead where they fell, and the Demon Race suffered grievous casualties—the Great Demon God himself was gravely wounded, barely clinging to life.

In the decades that followed, the Great Demon God dragged his shattered body across the Tongxuan Continent, using the Void Passages scattered throughout the land to construct an earth-shattering formation.

He sealed the entire Tongxuan Continent away, causing the planet that held it to fade from the Starry Sky's sight—so that any future visitors from beyond the stars would be unable to locate the Tongxuan Continent.

He left a sliver of his Soul Incarnation at the very center of that grand formation to guard it, forbidding approach for thousands of years.

He then sealed the Ancient Demon Clan.

From that point on there was no further news.

In the white, boundless world, everyone slowly opened their eyes; their expressions were indescribably complex—some found it hard to believe what they had just seen.

The atmosphere felt strange and heavy.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

As they came to, the pitch-black energy that had flowed into them earlier spilled back out and surged toward Yang Kai, pouring into his body and vanishing.

Yang Kai's body trembled violently; his face contorted as if enduring excruciating pain, sweat poured down his forehead, and his clothes were instantly drenched.

"Master!" Li Rong could not bother digesting the visions she had received and hurriedly looked toward Yang Kai.

Everyone else had already awakened; only Yang Kai still kept his eyes closed. Moreover, those streaks of pitch-black energy just now weighed heavily on Li Rong’s mind—she couldn’t understand why Yang Kai’s experience alone had been so different.

"Don't disturb him!" Meng Wuya suddenly warned, his face thoughtful and skeptical: "It seems he has gained something else."

"He's clearly the successor of the Great Demon God; the Demon God Lord shows some favoritism," Changyuan looked at Yang Kai with envy—the black energies that had surged into everyone carried the Great Demon God's memories, but they also constituted vast power.

If he could refine and absorb that power, Changyuan was sure his strength would rise considerably.

Unfortunately, those energies had flown out of his body and instead benefited Yang Kai.

Changyuan seethed inwardly.

"You all stay back!" Meng Wuya shot a displeased glance at Changyuan, afraid he might interfere at such a crucial moment.

Changyuan forced a bitter smile, "Brother Meng, after seeing what just happened, do you think I would still try anything?"

"I don't know, but I don't trust you." Meng Wuya remained unmoved.

"Fine—I'll keep my distance then!" Changyuan had no choice but to move away with the Four Demon Generals, watching from afar.

Yang Kai's pain seemed to grow more intense; his heroic frame shook, muscles tensing and twitching, causing both Li Rong and Han Fei to worry deeply.

"When did his True Yuan transform into Saint?" Meng Wuya suddenly asked; the True Yuan aura emanating from Yang Kai carried some telltale traces.

"A few months ago, when he went to Lingxiao Pavilion," Li Rong replied.

"A few months? That can't be so fast," Meng Wuya's expression flickered uneasily.

Yang Kai's current state bore the signs of a breakthrough, but typically a practitioner who has had their True Yuan transformed into Saint would still require years or even decades before glimpsing the mysteries of the Saint Realm.

Even if Yang Kai were talented, it was unreasonable for him to advance so far in only a few months.

It was simply incomprehensible.

While he pondered, a streak of blood slipped down under Yang Kai's left eyelid; the drop rolled like a pearl, mingled with a golden radiance.

"What's happening?" Meng Wuya's face went white with alarm.

"Could the Young Master be in danger?" Di Mo asked anxiously.

Meng Wuya said nothing and focused his probing on Yang Kai's condition; the more he investigated, the less assured he felt.

He had never encountered a situation like Yang Kai's at this very moment.
