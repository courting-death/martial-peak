## Chapter 71 — The Freak

The secret chamber instantly descended into chaos, with furious roars and the clash of fists and feet ringing out incessantly. Occasional muffled groans could be heard, accompanied by splatters of fresh blood.

As the saying goes, two fists cannot defeat four hands. Yang Kai’s strength was already vastly inferior to these few, and facing five opponents alone, how could he hope to keep himself unharmed?

Every time he landed a strike on someone else, he would immediately bear the brunt of four or five counterattacks.

These Law Enforcement Hall disciples were ruthless in their blows, each punch striking flesh and bone. Though they did not intend to kill Yang Kai, after such a brutal beating, anyone would be bedridden for at least a month.

“Stop!” After a long while, the Qi Movement Realm disciple suddenly shouted angrily, leaping out of the fight circle. “Enough! If you keep hitting him, someone’s going to die.”

The other four quickly withdrew as well, their gazes wary as they looked at Yang Kai, who was sprawled on the ground, beaten down.

“Damn it!” One of them clutched his cheek. “He slapped me so hard I almost lost a tooth.”

Another held his groin, face pale with lingering fear. “I nearly became a dead end for my clan. If I hadn’t dodged fast, I’d be the first to lie down.”

Though he avoided the vital parts, a burning pain still radiated from the root of his thigh. Yang Kai’s powerful, sweeping kick had been terrifyingly forceful—just recalling it sent chills down his spine.

The five exchanged glances, stunned. Despite their overwhelming advantage, each of them bore some degree of injury from the fight.

This realization shocked them deeply. Their faces flushed with embarrassment—how humiliating!

How could a mere Trial Disciple at Open Origin Realm, Third Stage, be so ferocious? They hadn’t taken him seriously when they ganged up on him, but now, reflecting on it, it seemed utterly incredible.

A sudden sound interrupted their thoughts. The five turned toward it, only to see Yang Kai, who should have been collapsed on the ground, trembling as he stood up, spitting a mouthful of blood.

His body flickered with shifting light, faint red glimmers flashing about him. A scorching heat radiated outward, like a volcano dormant for millennia suddenly erupting.

“That fluctuation of Yuan Qi…” The Qi Movement Realm disciple’s face twisted in horror. “Something’s wrong.”

This was no mere Third Stage Open Origin Realm disciple’s energy fluctuation. It was clearly at the peak of Open Origin Realm, and if he pushed further, he might soon reach Qi Movement Realm.

“He’s still standing?” Another widened his eyes in disbelief, nearly biting his tongue. Even he, after such a beating, would lack the strength to move a finger. Yet here Yang Kai was, rising again.

“He’s coming!” Suddenly, one shouted. Before the words even finished, the trembling Yang Kai surged forward like a fierce gale, charging at the five.

Midway, Yang Kai’s fist glowed fiery red, like a branding iron pulled from the embers.

The man who shouted gathered his Yuan Qi and met Yang Kai’s punch head-on.

With a thunderous crash, the man was sent flying backward, slamming into the wall before collapsing to the ground. A bitter taste filled his throat as he spat blood. Yang Kai barely paused, already seeking his next target.

“Impudent!” The Qi Movement Realm disciple leading them roared in fury. Five senior brothers attacking one junior, yet they failed to subdue him and were instead counterattacked. How could this disgrace be spread around? Where was their face?

In a fury, he thrust out a palm, sinking his Qi deep into his dantian, and bellowed, “Wind Whirl Force!”

The secret chamber instantly filled with howling wind as a visible miniature tornado burst forth from his palm, directly meeting Yang Kai’s fist.

The sound of tearing fabric rang out as Yang Kai’s sleeve was shredded by countless invisible blades, becoming tattered in an instant. His entire arm was streaked with fresh blood.

Yang Kai’s crimson eyes flashed with surprise. His True Yang Yuan Qi surged fiercely from his arm, blocking the opponent’s martial technique.

With a whoosh, a burst of fiery light exploded within the chamber.

Yang Kai’s True Yang Yuan Qi and the Qi Movement disciple’s Wind Whirl Force collided and ignited.

Amidst the flames, Yang Kai’s fist struck the Qi Movement disciple’s palm. Both were forced backward.

“What are you waiting for? Attack!” The Qi Movement disciple’s palm burned red. He had not expected Yang Kai’s Yuan Qi to be so strange. Though he was uninjured, he had suffered a hidden loss. Enraged, he roared.

The other three stunned Law Enforcement Hall disciples snapped back to their senses and rushed forward, surrounding Yang Kai once more. Each unleashed their skills, raining down a brutal assault.

The man who had been sent flying earlier, now burning with shame and anger, joined the fray.

After half a cup of tea’s time, the four finally ceased their attack, panting heavily. Their faces darkened as they retreated several zhang, nearly a whole room’s distance from Yang Kai, watching him warily.

They had been thoroughly shaken by this junior brother’s madness.

The second round of assault had been far more effective.

Yang Kai’s injuries were several times worse than before, yet the four had all paid a price in varying degrees.

“He won’t get up again, right?” One coughed into his hand, a patch of blood staining his palm.

“Shouldn’t be. He’s been beaten to this state,” another replied, rubbing his bruised eye, which had swollen into a large blister, as if scalded by boiling water.

All five felt bitter inside. They believed their heavy losses were due to the cramped terrain.

In this narrow chamber, five against one seemed advantageous, but it was difficult for all to strike simultaneously. Their opponent, however, had no such restraint—enemies surrounded him on all sides, allowing him to fight recklessly. Had this been in the wilds, where he could unleash his full strength, it would not have ended so awkwardly.

Still… this junior brother named Yang Kai was truly formidable. An ordinary Open Origin Realm Third Stage disciple was no match for him. No wonder Wei Zhuang had fallen to him.

Just as the five thought Yang Kai was finally down for good, he moved again—weak, battered, and bloodied, yet inch by inch, he straightened his body. The Yuan Qi radiating from him did not weaken but surged ever stronger.

“Damn it!” The Qi Movement disciple cursed silently. What kind of freak was this junior brother? After such a beating, he still refused to lose consciousness?

“Don’t come any closer, or I’ll kill you for sure!” The bruised man shouted, his voice fierce but trembling.

It was a comical and pitiful scene: the attackers huddled together, shouting at the beaten man not to approach. Yet the beaten one, barely conscious and dripping with blood, staggered forward step by heavy step toward the five.

Each step was heavy, unsteady, as if he might collapse at any moment, yet he continued advancing.

If not for the wall behind him, the five would likely have been forced to retreat repeatedly.
