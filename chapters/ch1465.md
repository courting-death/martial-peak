## Chapter 1465 — Not Knowing What's Good For Them

Yang Kai's current combat strength, though not afraid of any Origin Returning Realm, could do little if the Demon Blood Sect leader decided to flee—unless he had beforehand sealed off every escape route.

Fortunately, her plan did not succeed.

Moments later the Stone Puppet scampered back, thrusting a Spatial Ring into Yang Kai's hands; it was clearly the item the Demon Blood Sect leader had originally owned. Yang Kai took it, skimmed it with his Divine Sense, and happily pocketed it.

As the head of a sect, that beauty's possessions were naturally abundant, but Yang Kai had no time to inspect them one by one; he set them aside to deal with after leaving the Imperial Garden. Turning to look, he found no sign of Jin Shi's Spatial Ring—it had likely been accidentally cast into some void rift, and retrieving it was utterly impossible.

It mattered little; the spoils from this battle were already sufficient. At the very least, Yang Kai's original purpose had been achieved.

With a wave of his hand he stuffed the Stone Puppet into the Black Book Space. Yang Kai said lightly, "Let's go."

"Oh." Biluo seemed somewhat absent-minded; after a slight nod she followed Yang Kai as he flew toward the end of the Ice Path, wearing a strange expression the whole way.

She felt that her earlier judgment had been gravely mistaken!

When Biluo had first seen Yang Kai, she’d noticed that his cultivation was on par with her own, and instinctively felt he was unworthy of her Lady — a useless man who’d failed to advance, letting the gap between them widen with the years. Yet after witnessing this battle, she finally realized that though Yang Kai’s realm was two Stages lower than her Lady’s, his true combat strength was likely on par with hers. If her Lady had faced that fight instead, she might not have handled it as flawlessly as Yang Kai had.

Yet regrettably, Yang Kai had relied on far too many external aids. While such aid could be considered part of his strength, it was not entirely satisfactory—one's innate power was fundamental, and external forces were no long-term solution.

No one is without flaw; even the finest jade has an imperfection. It now seemed that the gap between him and her Lady, though present, was not great—he could barely be considered a match.

At that thought Biluo's mood inexplicably lightened.

With the dangers inside the Ice Path eliminated, travel proceeded unhindered. Before long Yang Kai led Biluo back to the hall they had been in before; here he was already familiar with the way.

He did not hurry to leave, however, but frowned slightly and stared back.

After a moment two figures hurried over from that direction—it was the two women from Ice Heart Valley.

Having left the Ice Path and seeing Yang Kai waiting here, the two women were startled and put on alert. The older of the two stepped forward and said, "May I ask your family name, Young Brother? I am Tan Tinghe of Chi Lan Star's Ice Heart Valley. Many thanks for saving our lives just now."

Yang Kai glanced at them coolly and replied, "If you've come only to offer thanks, there's no need. I already had a feud with those two; killing them has nothing to do with you."

Tan Tinghe gave a bitter smile. "That may be, but those two were clearly no good. If you hadn't killed them, my Junior Sister and I would have had no escape. So in any case, please accept a bow from us."

Saying so, she and the other woman offered a graceful bow.

Yang Kai's expression remained indifferent and he made no effort to stop them; though he had not intended to intervene, it was nevertheless true that they had been saved by his arrival—otherwise, with someone like Jin Shi, the two would likely have met a terrible fate.

Accepting their bow was not excessive.

After thanking him and seeing Yang Kai show little reaction, the two women looked somewhat embarrassed; they exchanged a glance, apparently with something they wanted to say but held back.

"Anything else?" Yang Kai frowned, showing displeasure—given their condition it would be best for them to find a place to sit and recuperate rather than trailing after him.

Could it be they saw his strength and wanted to join forces? Or hoped to rely on him for protection? Yang Kai guessed; if so, they had picked the wrong idea.

Though they were fair of face, he had no intention of helping out of kindness; carrying Biluo alone was already taxing enough—he had no intention of tending to two injured people.

Tan Tinghe smoothed a lock of hair behind her ear, looked at Yang Kai with hopeful eyes and asked, "May I ask, was that thing which devoured the Heaven and Earth Spirit the legendary Ancient Divine Spirit Ice Phoenix?"

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed; he stared coldly at her, his expression darkening.

Sensing his ill will, Tan Tinghe hurriedly waved her hand. "Young brother, please don't misunderstand. My Junior Sister and I have no intention of harming you; moreover, given our condition we lack the ability— I merely wish to ask."

"Is it any of your concern whether it is or isn't?" Yang Kai snorted. This woman was terribly ungrateful—why pry into such matters? Didn't she know some things were taboo? If he were the sort to lose his temper, one word would have been enough to kill her.

Hearing his reply, Tan Tinghe’s face lit up with delight, and she hurriedly said, “If it truly is the Ice Phoenix… young brother, would you be willing to transfer it to my Ice Heart Valley? We can meet any demand you make!”

“Transfer it to you?” Yang Kai’s expression froze for a moment, then he burst into angry laughter. “Are you out of your mind? You actually have the gall to say that?”

Even Biluo, who was merely a bystander, looked at Tan Tinghe with scorn.

This proposal was the funniest joke she had ever heard in her life. How could something as noble as the Ice Phoenix be traded away? For Yang Kai to obtain even a wisp of its remnant soul was a heaven-defying fortune — how could he possibly hand it over to someone else?

Yet faced with Yang Kai's cold words, Tan Tinghe did not lose heart; she spoke earnestly, "To be frank, Ice Heart Valley cultivates ice-natured techniques and reveres the Ice Phoenix as its totem, so that thing would have unimaginable effect for us."

"And so?" Yang Kai grew impatient.

"If my perception serves me, you do not cultivate ice-natured techniques. Though the Ice Phoenix is rare, it would be of little use to you and could not realize its full potential. If you agree to transfer it, I can, on behalf of the Sect, promise you any condition!" Tan Tinghe spoke quickly, laying out her plan, and the other Ice Heart Valley woman nodded in agreement.

If Yang Kai truly consented to such a trade, Ice Heart Valley would spare no cost; she therefore dared to make the decision even over other senior members, believing the rest of the Sect would only be pleased and never resentful.

"I'll treat your words as wind in my ear. Utter one more and I'll make sure the two of you never leave the Imperial Garden!" Yang Kai stared coldly at them, threatened without mercy, then tugged Biluo and walked off.

"Young brother, think it over carefully; if you change your mind, come to Chi Lan Star's Ice Heart Valley!" Tan Tinghe still shouted after them, unwilling to relent.

No sooner had the words left her mouth than a streak of golden light shot from ahead, transforming mid-flight into a lash that struck her like a whip. A cry escaped her; Tan Tinghe was flung into the air and crashed heavily to the ground.

When she looked up, Yang Kai and Biluo had already vanished.

"Senior Sister!" the other Ice Heart Valley woman cried in alarm and hurried over to help Tan Tinghe to her feet.

"I'm fine." Tan Tinghe shook her head slowly, a trace of unwillingness on her face. She wanted to pursue, but recalling the force of that blow she dared not act rashly.

She understood her earlier words had aroused the other's killing intent; fortunately the other was not vicious at heart, so he had merely punished her mildly rather than striking to kill.

To further enrage him now would be unwise—it would be no different from courting death.

Yet watching someone who hadn’t even cultivated an Ice Attribute technique walk away carrying the Ice Phoenix’s remnant soul, she was filled with unwillingness. If such a thing were in Ice Heart Valley’s possession, the benefits it could bring would be immeasurable.

"How can that person be so unreasonable?" the younger woman fumed.

"We were at fault for our lack of discernment," Tan Tinghe said with a bitter smile.

"But Senior Sister, shall we really stand idly by and watch such a great opportunity slip away?" the other woman clearly found it hard to give up.

"What can we do? Now we can only hope he will one day change his mind. In any case I already told him the star where Ice Heart Valley cultivates; if one day he wants to trade, he will come to the Sect," Tan Tinghe shook her head. "Enough—this matter ends here. Junior Sister, let us find a place to recuperate."

"Very well."

Elsewhere, Yang Kai and Biluo had left the palace. Though Tan Tinghe's proposal had been rebuffed and she had been taught a lesson, Yang Kai's mood was somewhat odd.

No surprise— the Ice Phoenix remnant soul had been left for Su Yan; it was Su Yan's inheritance, and now an outsider had taken a fancy to it and had the gall to propose a swap, which rightly angered him.

If he had borne any grudge against those two women, he would have killed them outright instead of letting them whine.

Along the way Biluo was utterly obedient and said nothing. She knew her safe passage through the perilous Imperial Garden was entirely owed to Yang Kai, so she did not dare to trouble him.

Soon the two arrived before a labyrinth. Standing at its entrance, Yang Kai frowned, struggling to recall the way.

He had been here once before.

The day he and Fei Zhi Tu and the others came here, they had gotten lost inside but overall things had gone smoothly; at that time Lian Guang's puppets had scouted ahead, saving time and avoiding many dangers.

Now, without puppets to rely on, Yang Kai could only depend on his memory.

Fortunately he could roughly recall the route they had taken that day; even if some spots were unclear, once he reached a certain point he should be able to remember more.
