## Chapter 1167 — Gathering

The Space Blade is the direct manifestation of spatial power — an attack only Yang Kai can wield. It is unfathomably uncanny and impossible to fully guard against; if he can call it at will, it becomes another bargaining chip for his survival and combat.

Yang Kai had never been to the Flowing Flame Sandland and knew little of it, but from Qian Tong's account it had to be unimaginably perilous. He dared not be careless and therefore prepared as thoroughly as possible.

Sitting cross-legged, Yang Kai first took out the Zhi Stone he had won at the auction.

Yang Flame said the stone contained a very peculiar energy: it could not be absorbed by martial artists nor used to forge artifacts, but it was suitable for cultivating strange insects and bizarre creatures — the Soul-Devouring insects were one such species.

At the auction it was precisely the Soul-Devouring insects' abnormal reaction that caused Yang Kai to buy the Zhi Stone; otherwise it would certainly have slipped from his grasp.

The moment the Zhi Stone was brought out, Yang Kai sensed within his Sea of Consciousness that the Soul-Devouring insects on the Six-Colored Treasure Isle were instantly stirred, as if eager to escape their isle and surge into the Zhi Stone.

But without Yang Kai's consent they could not leave the Treasure Isle no matter what, which only made them more restless.

Yang Kai no longer interfered. He eased the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness and used his Divine Sense to gather the countless Soul-Devouring insects and pour them into the Zhi Stone.

Once inside the Zhi Stone the Soul-Devouring insects immediately became frenzied, each seeming pumped full of blood and radiating a sinister aura.

Listening closely, Yang Kai could also hear a rustling sound, like silkworms eating mulberry leaves.

Under the watch of his Divine Sense, Yang Kai discovered the Soul-Devouring insects had begun devouring one another again, sparking a tide of internecine warfare within the Zhi Stone.

The weaker Soul-Devouring insects had no chance to survive at that moment; they were swept away in an instant by their stronger kin. After the weak were cleared, the stronger ones began to vie and swallow each other, causing the population to plummet.

Yang Kai rejoiced beyond measure!

The last time the Soul-Devouring insects cannibalized one another was long ago, but afterward their power noticeably increased. With this spectacle repeating, Yang Kai was certain that once they stabilized their potency would rise again.

He was filled with eager anticipation!

If the Soul-Devouring insects could evolve to a level that even Origin Returning Realm experts could not withstand, then on Dark Star he would be unrivaled. At that point, without Yang Flame setting arrays, the insects alone would be enough to deter anyone from trespassing on his patch of land.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai realized the mutual slaughter among the Soul-Devouring insects would continue for a long time. He stopped wasting attention on them and placed the Zhi Stone in a corner, letting them evolve on their own.

He then took out some Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicines, set up a pill furnace, and began refining Ice-Snow Pills.

Refining Origin-Grade Lower-Level pills no longer troubled him. In just over a day he produced two bottles totaling twenty Ice-Snow Pills, seven or eight of which formed pill patterns.

After finishing this, Yang Kai entered seclusion to temper his Secret Treasure and train his spatial power.

Time passed in a flash — three months went by.

In the stone chamber Yang Kai closed his eyes and concentrated. In his left hand he gripped an Ethereal Crystal, repeatedly drawing on its energy with spatial power, while his other hand moved almost unconsciously. Each swing tore a rift in space like a blade; as soon as a rift formed it shot off in all directions.

The whole chamber had become a wreck, strewn with the scars of the Space Blade's ravages.

After three straight months of seclusion, Yang Kai's Space Blade had grown far more potent than when it first appeared; in speed and stability it was far superior to its early form.

The Space Blade's lethality relies chiefly on speed and stability, the latter being especially crucial. Unlike other attacks where more Saint Yuan means more damage, its main destructive principle has nothing to do with the amount of Saint Yuan — it is spatial devouring.

If it is stable enough, it can swallow anything in its path into the void rift; it can even devour incoming attacks. Imagine an enemy unleashing a killing move or a Secret Treasure — the Space Blade meets it and consumes that attack or treasure outright. At that moment Yang Kai would need no defense; offense would be the best defense.

But that stability can be disturbed by other martial artists' attacks; if the interference is severe the spatial rift will close and the Space Blade will be rendered useless.

Thus Yang Kai had spent this time studying the Space Blade's stability — its speed had seen little improvement, but its steadiness grew.

Burning through many Ethereal Crystals and embracing a costly method of training, Yang Kai gradually gained some proficiency in employing the Space Blade.

He lost track of time while training, only snapping out of it when a Divine Sense fluctuation came from the communication compass he had set aside.

Qian Tong had sent word.

He hastily picked up the compass, poured his Divine Awareness into it to probe, then rose at once and strode out.

Three months was still too short to fully master the Space Blade; it wasn't yet reliable in combat. But with the Flowing Flame Sandland opening, Yang Kai had no time to remain secluded.

After three months of tempering, both the Purple Shield and the Hundred Mountains Painting had become much more attuned to him and could be used in battle.

He also had two bottles of Ice-Snow Pills ready; they should suffice for emergencies.

Exiting the cave, Yang Kai paused briefly. He found Dragon Lair Mountain greatly changed: the Spiritual Qi had grown extraordinarily dense, a veil of spiritual mist cloaked the various peaks, and around the cave many exquisite houses had been built, with several strange installations standing erect.

Dozens of warriors accompanying Wu Yi bustled about busily, while Wu Yi and Yang Flame were both intently fiddling with something, their faces alight with excitement.

When they saw Yang Kai come out of seclusion the two women froze for a moment, then quickly understood, set down what they were doing, and came over.

"Leaving now?" Wu Yi asked.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded slightly and cautioned, "After I leave, don't let anyone into my chamber. And don't touch that Zhi Stone — there are dangerous things inside."

"Understood," Wu Yi replied at once.

"Elder Qian's two Origin-Grade Secret Treasures have been delivered, right?" Yang Kai asked Yang Flame.

"I gave them to him long ago. About ten days after you entered seclusion Elder Qian personally brought a large amount of materials; I handed the two treasures over then."

"Good."

"You can go, but Xiaoxiao should stay. Without its help refining items is too laborious," Yang Flame added.

Xiaoxiao was the Stone Puppet, a name Yang Flame had given it; Yang Kai didn't mind. This trip to the Flowing Flame Sandland wouldn't require the Stone Puppet's aid anyway. He nodded, promised a few more things, and hurried off toward Tianyun City.

Halfway there, a streak of azure light shot toward him. As it drew near he realized it was Luo Qing.

"Young Master Yang!" Luo Qing halted his Star Shuttle, bowed from atop it, and said, "The elder said to bring you to the Space Array immediately. Everyone is ready; only you remain."

"Thanks." Yang Kai returned the salute and rode with him toward Tianyun City.

On the way Yang Kai asked Luo Qing about the Flowing Flame Sandland. Luo Qing knew little beyond the forbidden area's imminent opening. Factions across Dark Star were rushing to various entrances; once the forbidden area opened they would swarm in.

Flying over Tianyun City, Yang Kai headed straight toward a grand palace. Upon entering, he was surprised to find nearly two hundred people gathered inside. Ninety percent of them were cultivators in the Saint King Realm, most at the Second or Third Stage, with only a few at the First Stage. The Flowing Flame Sandland was perilous — a First-Stage Saint King entering it would be of little use.

Yang Kai frowned. Qian Tong had said Yingyue Hall had only fifty slots — how were there so many people here?

And judging by their posture, they all intended to use the Space Array to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland.

As Yang Kai arrived countless eyes turned to him. Qian Tong came out laughing heartily, greeted him with the utmost warmth, and said, "Perfect timing, Nephew Yang. The assembly has just completed and we can activate the Space Array. Come with me."

The two Origin-Grade Secret Treasures Yang Kai agreed to refine for him were handed over to Qian Tong in barely ten days, and though they were Origin-Grade Lower-Level, they were almost on the cusp of Origin-Grade Middle-Level. Those two defensive treasures had been taken into Wei Guchang and Xuan'er's bodies.

Placing such items on the auction block would fetch at least four hundred thousand Saint Crystals; being ice-based and countering the blistering heat of the Flowing Flame Sandland, their price would be even higher.

Qian Tong had thus recouped his initial investment in courting Yang Kai's favor.

Naturally he treated Yang Kai with extreme courtesy now; even for this gathering he had first assembled the others before summoning Yang Kai, not wishing to keep him waiting.

As Qian Tong personally welcomed him, the many warriors in the hall glanced sideways, curious why a First Stage Saint King Realm fighter could draw such deference from an elder.

"Senior Brother Wei, who is that fellow? Have we been waiting for him all this time?" a pretty woman slipped close to Wei Guchang and asked softly.

"He doesn't look like someone of much pedigree, and his strength is so low, only First Stage of the Saint King Realm," another immediately chimed in.

Wei Guchang cast them a look, subtly stepped away from the woman, and said coolly, "Who he is is none of your business. Just don't provoke him."

Stung by Wei Guchang's measured rebuff, the woman smiled awkwardly and withdrew, her feelings bitter.

Wei Guchang was Yingyue Hall's most talented disciple: handsome, upright, and naturally the object of many women's attention. Yet he treated them all indifferently, seeming to have eyes only for Xuan'er.
