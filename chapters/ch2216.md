## Chapter 2216 — Giant Python

Another day passed. After absorbing the Divine Soul left behind by the death of an Eleventh-Tier demonic beast, Yang Kai’s body suddenly swayed slightly.

He couldn’t help but furrow his brows.

Because in that instant, he actually felt a faint discomfort. This discomfort was hard to describe, yet extremely clear, making his whole body feel somewhat uneasy.

“So this is the limit…” Yang Kai wasn’t flustered. With a brief thought, he understood the reason.

Gao Xueting had previously said that absorbing the Divine Soul Origin left behind by the death of living beings here could rapidly strengthen one’s own Divine Soul, but it wasn’t without consequences.

When absorption reached a certain point, a state of saturation would occur.

Once this happened, it would be impossible to absorb any more Divine Soul Origin, or else some drawbacks might arise.

Yang Kai’s current situation was undoubtedly a sign of reaching saturation.

It made sense. In just three days, he had driven the Soul-Devouring Worms to kill over a hundred demonic beasts and absorbed the Divine Soul Origin of each, including some Eleventh-Tier ones. Such quantity and speed were truly astonishing.

Yang Kai estimated that Xia Sheng and the others probably didn’t even have a fifth of what he had, because along the way, he never needed to rest or recover—he simply sent the Soul-Devouring Worms whenever he found prey.

Meanwhile, Xia Sheng and the others had to recover after every battle, so their efficiency was naturally much lower.

“What a pity…” he muttered to himself, a look of regret on his face.

His original plan was to use this momentum to push his Divine Soul power all the way to the Emperor Realm. If he could reach the Emperor Realm in Divine Soul strength, his future cultivation would be smooth sailing.

But now that he’d reached the limit, there was no solution—he could only wait patiently for his Spirit Body to fully digest the Divine Soul Origin he’d absorbed over the past few days…

He didn’t slow his pace, but continued forward at the same speed as before.

Although he could no longer absorb more Divine Soul Origin, the Soul-Devouring Worms still could, so there was no waste.

The deeper he went, the higher the average level of demonic beasts he encountered.

When he first split up from Xia Sheng and the others, he could still find some Eighth-Tier, Seventh-Tier, or even weaker demonic beasts. Naturally, he had no interest in these and ignored them all.

But as time passed, these weaker demonic beasts disappeared, replaced by higher-level ones.

By now, Yang Kai could no longer see any Ninth-Tier or below demonic beasts. Every demonic beast here was at least Tenth-Tier!

By his estimation, if he went any deeper, even Tenth-Tier demonic beasts would no longer appear before him.

At a certain moment, just as he was searching for prey, a foul wind suddenly swept through the forest, trees swayed, and an unusual pressure rapidly approached. At the same time, a strange sound reached Yang Kai’s ears.

He immediately grew alert, focusing his attention in that direction.

Crash—

It was as if some immense force was crashing through the forest, sending trees toppling in all directions and scattering leaves like rain.

Soon, a streak of purple light shot toward him at incredible speed.

“Hm?” Yang Kai looked surprised, for he saw that the purple light rushing at him was actually a small demonic beast, about the size of a civet.

The strength of a demonic beast couldn’t be judged by size, but when Yang Kai swept it with his Divine Sense, he clearly discerned the purple civet’s level—Ninth-Tier!

He hadn’t seen any Ninth-Tier demonic beasts for some time, since that level could no longer survive in this area.

So when this purple civet appeared, Yang Kai was a bit surprised, not knowing how such a weak demonic beast could survive here.

But its speed was indeed impressive. Yang Kai discovered and checked its level in an instant, but before he could act, the creature had already darted past him to his rear.

As man and beast brushed past each other, Yang Kai clearly saw a look of surprise flash in the civet’s eyes, as if it had discovered something novel.

This was clearly a sign of intelligence. All the demonic beasts Yang Kai had encountered before lacked this ability. Those beasts only followed their killing instincts—whenever they met Yang Kai, even if he didn’t attack, they would initiate combat.

But this purple civet was obviously different.

However, Yang Kai had no time to ponder it further and continued to stare solemnly ahead.

Because behind the purple civet, a truly fierce creature was coming…

Crash—

Another loud crash of falling trees sounded, and then a flat head the size of a rice vat suddenly poked out from ahead. Its head was covered in scales with crimson stripes, looking extremely ferocious. Its eyes, as large as a human’s, had vertical emerald pupils that sent chills down the spine. Its gaping mouth revealed a flickering red tongue, emitting a constant hissing sound.

It was a giant python demonic beast!

For some unknown reason, it had chased the purple civet all the way to Yang Kai.

As soon as it appeared, the giant python fixed its vertical pupils on Yang Kai. Then, its body, as thick as a man’s embrace, slowly emerged, head raised high, coiled in midair, its tongue flickering as it stared at Yang Kai with ill intent.

“Passing the trouble along, huh…” Yang Kai turned his head, casting a sinister glance at the purple civet hiding behind a tree, peeking out with its little head.

The purple civet shrank its neck when it saw him looking, but soon peeked out again, seemingly wanting to see if Yang Kai could drive away the giant python.

“I’ll deal with you after I handle this one.” Yang Kai sneered, turning back to face the giant python.

With prey before him, he had no reason to back down, so he prepared to strike.

Perhaps sensing Yang Kai was not to be trifled with, the giant python didn’t attack immediately, but instead looked down at him from above, its eyes flashing with extreme danger.

Yang Kai swept it with his Divine Sense, his expression growing even more grave.

He realized this giant python was the strongest demonic beast he’d encountered so far. Its Divine Soul strength was nearly equal to his own—in other words, it too was at the peak of the Dao Origin Realm. Given a bit more time, it would surely break through to the Emperor Realm!

In this world, only a powerful Divine Soul mattered. Without a physical body, as long as one’s Divine Soul was strong enough, advancing to the next tier was easy.

This giant python was undoubtedly already halfway into the Emperor Realm.

After a brief standoff, the giant python lost patience, its killing instinct taking over.

Its eyes flashed green, and an invisible force surged toward Yang Kai.

In an instant, purple light burst from Yang Kai’s body—the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier appeared.

The surface of the transparent barrier instantly rippled, waves spreading across it as an invisible force hammered down, denting it deeply inward.

A Divine Soul attack!

Every demonic beast here, and every living being, possessed this Divine Soul secret art. It was a method of attacking the enemy by channeling one’s Divine Soul power.

Simple, direct, yet extremely powerful.

Especially when there was a large gap in strength, this move could often decide the outcome instantly.

Yang Kai had faced this move from nearly every demonic beast he’d encountered, so he was already adept at handling it.

The Ziyang Profound Light Barrier was at least a Dao Origin-Grade Divine Soul Secret Treasure. Even though Yang Kai hadn’t fully refined it and couldn’t unleash its full power, it still provided excellent protection.

No demonic beast had ever broken through this Secret Treasure’s defense.

Yet…

The giant python’s Divine Soul attack made the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier flicker wildly, nearly shattering it. Yang Kai himself staggered back a few steps, his face paling.

As expected of a peak Eleventh-Tier demonic beast—its first move was extraordinary.

Moreover, as it unleashed its Divine Soul attack, it also whipped its tail like a steel whip at Yang Kai, stirring up a fierce wind.

Trees in its path snapped instantly, showing the immense force behind the blow.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s expression grew grave—he dared not take it head-on.

With a flicker, he vanished from his original spot.

Crack—

Countless trees shattered with a deafening crash, but the giant python’s attack missed, and it lost sight of Yang Kai.

Its battle instincts made it uneasy. The frequency of its tongue flickering increased, and as if sensing something, it suddenly looked up.

In its line of sight, Yang Kai had already appeared above its head, furious, shouting, “Beast, take my move!”

As he spoke, he unleashed a Divine Soul attack, condensing his Divine Sense into an invisible blade and slashing at the python’s eyes.

Clang, clang—two metallic sounds rang out as sparks flew from the python’s eyelids.

At the moment of impact, it closed its eyelids, rendering Yang Kai’s attack ineffective.

But in the next instant, a buzzing sound arose.

As the python closed its eyes, Yang Kai released the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms.

A black cloud appeared, surging with boundless demonic qi.

The insects swarmed, carrying an unparalleled might.

When the cloud of Soul-Devouring Worms appeared, a look of human-like panic flashed in the python’s eyes—it seemed extremely afraid of the insects.

Meanwhile, behind Yang Kai, the purple civet that had been hiding behind a tree and secretly watching the battle was now trembling uncontrollably. Its eyelids fluttered, and with a faint groan, it toppled straight over, fainting on the spot.

Judging by this, the Soul-Devouring Worms seemed to have greatly intimidated both demonic beasts.
