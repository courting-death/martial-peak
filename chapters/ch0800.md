## Chapter 800 — He Will

After a moment, a concealed spot materialized in his perception; Yang Kai darted there, Void Force empowering him. In a flash he reappeared beneath the clear midday sky.

Before him stood the bluestone carved with the two characters "Sacred Tomb" belonging to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—enter here and when you exit you still return to this place.

The moment he appeared, Yang Kai immediately suppressed his presence and silently released his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings.

He didn't know how long he'd been inside the Sacred Tomb, but it couldn't have been short; there was no one before the bluestone now—Xu Hui and the others had evidently dispersed.

This was the perfect moment for him to slip away unnoticed.

Once he left the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, he would be free to go wherever he pleased; even if Xu Hui had godlike means, he couldn't force Yang Kai to return.

But after probing with his mind, Yang Kai's expression turned strange.

The entire Nine Heavens Sacred Land lay in ruin, as if it had just endured a massive battle; battlefields were strewn everywhere, and the houses clustered among the Nine Peaks had mostly become crumbled ruins.

A faint metallic tang of blood hung in the air, and distant anguished cries could be heard.

A familiar life aura lingered not far off; it seemed to sense his presence and grew unstable.

Yang Kai turned sharply and locked eyes with An Ling'er's beautiful gaze.

The Saintess, emblem of nobility and purity, had a blue headscarf wrapped around her head; her white robes were smudged with dust and flecked with blood, as if she had just hurried back from some hectic errand.

When she saw Yang Kai, joy and disbelief burst into her eyes; she stood stunned.

She opened her mouth to call out, but Yang Kai vanished and reappeared before her the next instant, clamping a hand over her mouth. No matter how she struggled, she couldn't break free as he whisked her to a secluded corner pavilion.

"Don't shout. I'll let you go," Yang Kai said softly.

A trace of fear flickered in An Ling'er's eyes; she quickly nodded at his words.

Only then did Yang Kai release her. He laughed softly, stepping back to avoid giving the impression he intended to silence her permanently.

"You came out?" An Ling'er glanced around and asked in a very quiet voice.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "Just came out."

"You really managed to come out!" An Ling'er pressed her lips together, relief washing across her face—she had been worried for his safety. Seeing him unharmed was like a weight lifted from her chest.

An Ling'er had long felt partly responsible for Yang Kai being forced into the Sacred Tomb; the thought had gnawed at her and she had visibly wasted away.

Now at last she felt reassured.

"It's good you're out!" she patted her chest. "Since you're out, leave quickly—go south before the Grand Elders realize you're gone."

Yang Kai's eyes flickered; surprised, he asked, "You're willing to let me go?"

An Ling'er gave a bitter smile. "You don't belong here; keeping you will only make you resent this place. Better to let you leave."

Yang Kai's expression shifted, and he looked at her with quiet gratitude.

"What are you staring at? If someone finds you you won't be able to leave!" An Ling'er's brows drew together.

"Because I noticed you're beautiful," Yang Kai said, flattering her on the spur of the moment.

An Ling'er blushed and scolded him, "Stop your smooth talk. I already know you're no good—don't think this will win me over."

Yang Kai forced a laugh, straightened his face, cupped his fist in salute, and said, "Then we part here. I hope we'll meet again sometime."

"Yes, go quickly—head south, the Grand Elders are all to the north," An Ling'er reminded him.

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly, confirmed his bearings, and quietly made his way south.

Not long after Yang Kai had gone, a graceful figure suddenly materialized beside An Ling'er like a phantom.

"Elder Yu Ying!" An Ling'er cried out in alarm, covering her mouth.

Yu Ying stared in the direction Yang Kai had disappeared, sighed softly, and murmured, "You let him go just like that—could you bear it?"

An Ling'er felt awkward—she hadn't known when Yu Ying had been following her, yet the elder's words made it clear she'd seen the whole scene.

"I only saw him leave in a hurry, with no sign of lingering," Yu Ying said.

"There's nothing here for him to linger on," An Ling'er forced a smile.

"And you—after sharing hardships with him so long, he shows you no affection? You feel nothing for him?" Yu Ying asked coolly.

An Ling'er shook her head. "He's a troublesome sort and I don't think I'm worthy. If anything, we're better as friends. Still, being with him makes me feel cared for, as if I'm younger and protected... And with the Sacred Land in its present state, he won't be dragged down by it. Elder Yu Ying, please don't tell the Grand Elder—let us all pretend he's dead."

Yu Ying frowned, pondering.

An Ling'er hurriedly clung to one of Yu Ying's arms and began pleading in a coy, wheedling way.

Yielding to her, Yu Ying smiled wryly and massaged her temple. "All right, all right, I won't say anything. Today I saw nothing. Ling'er, you've been exhausted—go rest. We'll manage things outside. The Sacred Land's hopes now rest with you; you hold the training required for the Saintess. If we recover, the next generation of Saintesses will depend on you."

An Ling'er brightened at the promise.

But when they recalled the Sacred Land's current ruin, both women's expressions dimmed. Whether they could survive this catastrophe was uncertain.

Perhaps before long they would all perish here; if that weren't possible, Yu Ying would not have agreed so readily.

A faint voice drifted around the pavilion: "Elder Yu Ying is indeed easy to persuade." The words echoed, their source impossible to locate.

Yu Ying's face changed; she condensed True Yuan in an instant and called, "Who—!"

At that moment a figure materialized nearby, smiling cheerfully as he regarded them.

"Yitian Shadow?" An Ling'er exclaimed, instantly recognizing the Nine Heavens Divine Technique—an extraordinary body skill useful in both combat and escape.

Startled, she looked at the returning Yang Kai and blurted, "Why didn't you leave?"

Yang Kai shrugged and casually swept a glance at Yu Ying.

Earlier, as he was departing, he had sensed this woman trailing An Ling'er. To be safe he had concealed himself to observe, and upon overhearing their conversation he felt that simply leaving then would have been... unkind.

"How could you hide from my Divine Sense? I clearly sensed you had left—when did you return?" Yu Ying stared at Yang Kai, disbelief flashing in her eyes.

She cultivated at the First Stage of the Saint Realm, yet Yang Kai had crept to her side silently; had he meant them harm, she would now be a corpse.

Realizing this, a cold sweat broke out over Yu Ying as she found herself facing someone fated to be the future Saint Lord—someone of unfathomable depth.

"Why are you so tense? I don't intend to do anything to you," Yang Kai grinned, not answering Yu Ying's question. His expression turned solemn as he said in a low voice, "I've been wondering—what's happened to your Nine Heavens Sacred Land?"

An Ling'er opened her mouth to speak, but Yu Ying cut in coldly, "Is that any of your business? If you don't want to inherit the Saint Lord position, what's the point of asking?"

Yang Kai frowned, feeling puzzled.

The woman had been courteous before; now she treated him like an enemy, coldly rejecting him.

Yang Kai did not press it. He smiled faintly, "Fine, I won't pry. Farewell."

With that he turned to leave.

"Don't go!" Yu Ying suddenly called out.

"Why?" Yang Kai glanced back, impatience on his face.

Yu Ying's expression was complicated and awkward; after hesitating she said, "Wait a moment—don't leave. I'll tell you something."

"Sorry, I don't want to know. The more I know, the more trouble I'll have!" Yang Kai replied.

"You—" Yu Ying stared at him in astonishment, aghast at his attitude. "How can you be like this?"

He behaved like a rogue, with none of the dignity expected of a Saint Lord. He had even entered the Sacred Tomb—how could he still act this way?

Ordinarily, someone who entered and then left the Sacred Tomb would take the Sacred Land as their home.

Yu Ying could not comprehend it.

Seeing the woman's gloom, Yang Kai brightened and sat on the pavilion bench, directing An Ling'er, "Tell me the story."

An Ling'er stole a glance at Yu Ying and saw the elder's predatory glare toward Yang Kai; she couldn't help smiling slightly and said, "Why must you know? Once you know you'll only bring trouble on yourself."

"You made it sound so serious—I naturally want to know. Besides, you called us friends... I have few friends," Yang Kai said earnestly.

An Ling'er was moved and smiled broadly. "Gou Chi will certainly regret not treating you sincerely in the future!"

"He will," Yang Kai grinned confidently.
