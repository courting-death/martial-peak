## Chapter 150 — Tempering

“He is just too pleased with himself! This brat dares to underestimate me!” Gritting her teeth, Hu Jiao’er, along with her sister, activated their cultivation techniques, dispelling the cold energy within their bodies as they pursued Yang Kai’s steps.

On the first day, the three of them ascended the thousand-layer staircase!

Upon reaching the thousandth layer, Yang Kai took a tentative step upward and discovered, as he had suspected, that the energy contained within the thousand and first layer had transformed into a Yang attribute.

After five hundred layers of transition, the fusion of heat and cold created an increasingly powerful impact, sufficient to halt nine-tenths of the disciples from the three sects at the threshold of the thousand layers.

Only those with profound strength could rely on their cultivation to step onto this thousandth layer.

Logically speaking, Hu Mei’er should not have been able to reach this point, yet she had done so, and she did not seem overly fatigued. In contrast, Hu Jiao’er, who was at the True Yuan Realm, showed signs of weariness on her face.

The three chose to rest here for half a day.

Meanwhile, at around the three thousandth layer, a figure clad in white was steadily making her way toward the peak. Her steps exuded an ethereal and composed aura, as if the impacts contained within the staircase posed no hindrance to her at all.

Her garments flowed gracefully, her expression calm; she occasionally tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, her breath steady, showing no signs of fatigue.

The surges of energy beneath her feet dissipated into nothingness upon entering her body, much like the melting snow of early spring.

Her delicate features made the sky dim in comparison, yet she was as pure as ice, resembling a flawless ice doll.

She was Su Yan!

Having cultivated the Ice Heart Technique, she, like Yang Kai, possessed a unique advantage in navigating this trial of alternating heat and cold.

Among the seven to eight hundred disciples from the three sects who practiced Yang and cold attribute techniques, they were not the only ones. At this moment, all of them were experiencing their own advantages. However, due to differences in strength and the quality of their techniques, no one could reach the heights that Su Yan had attained, surpassing three thousand layers.

Below the two thousandth layer, several figures could also be seen.

Jie Hongchen wore a grim expression, gasping heavily as he sat cross-legged on a layer of the staircase, using pills to recover from his exhaustion.

“The inheritance is mine; everything here belongs to me! Once I obtain the inheritance here, I, Jie Hongchen, will be the foremost disciple among the three sects! I can elevate Lingxiao Pavilion above the other two sects, even subjugate them! I will make all who doubt me vanish without a trace! Yang Kai, you are the first! Hahaha, I, Jie Hongchen, am the true overlord of this world!”

Jie Hongchen had become somewhat deranged. The energy within him surged chaotically; for someone of his level, such a state was unusual, resembling that of a Qi Movement Realm warrior.

The scene of the three sects’ disciples battling the Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast lingered in his mind.

What he saw was not the unity and determination of the three sects’ disciples. Instead, he perceived only their disdain and contempt for him. The Tortoise-shaped Demon Beast was a result of Jie Hongchen’s actions, yet it was ultimately Yang Kai who severely wounded it, giving the three sects’ disciples the opportunity to slay it.

Though no one had openly criticized him, this silent reproach left Jie Hongchen seething with resentment. Many of the junior brothers and sisters who had once revered him now looked at him with a strange gaze.

This was intolerable for Jie Hongchen! No one could look at him with such eyes! No one!

On the several hundred layers of stairs ahead of Jie Hongchen, Fang Ziqi gasped for breath. As he stepped down, his entire body shivered involuntarily, struggling to dispel the cold energy that had invaded him, with signs of frost forming at the edges of his brows.

“Ah, let’s take a break.” Fang Ziqi’s demeanor was calm; he understood that inheritance depended on opportunity, and while strength played a role, it was not the decisive factor.

Thus, despite his envy of the inheritance here, he was not as obsessed and frantic as Jie Hongchen.

“This place seems designed specifically for those who have cultivated Yang and cold attribute techniques.” As Fang Ziqi took out a pill and popped it into his mouth, he muttered to himself, “Damn it, what am I even doing here? Isn’t this a waste of time? I might as well take a few junior sisters and see if there are any other benefits in this Inheritance Celestial Cave.”

With this thought, he found it increasingly reasonable. Moments later, Fang Ziqi suddenly stood up and decided not to ascend any further, instead swiftly flying downward, soon leaving the endless staircase behind.

Returning to the ground, he saw Du Yishuang sitting cross-legged with a gloomy expression.

“Eh, Junior Sister Du, why are you out as well?” Fang Ziqi was greatly surprised.

Du Yishuang shot him a cold glance, recalling her senior brother’s previous frivolity, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment. She turned her head away with a cold snort, ignoring him.

“Come, come, come! Senior Brother was just looking for someone to accompany me, and you happened to be here.” Fang Ziqi stepped forward and, without hesitation, pulled Du Yishuang up, wrapping his arm around her without a care.

“What are you doing?” Du Yishuang struggled fiercely, but how could she escape Fang Ziqi’s grasp? His arm was like an iron hoop around her waist, and the heat of his masculine aura made her heart race.

“Let go of me, or I’ll bite you!” Du Yishuang threatened fiercely, like a little tiger ready to pounce.

“Men do things; women should be quiet and follow along.” Fang Ziqi declared with overwhelming confidence.

Du Yishuang was momentarily dazed, but she no longer struggled as fiercely as before.

On the staircase below the two thousandth layer, Long Jun from the Blood Battle Gang was also recovering. These few were all young talents among the three sects, their strengths being relatively comparable, hence their positions on the staircase were not vastly different.

In contrast to Jie Hongchen’s madness and Fang Ziqi’s indifference, Long Jun’s face bore tension mixed with a hint of expectation, uncertain if he could successfully obtain the inheritance at the peak.

If only he could succeed! Long Jun clearly lacked confidence; although he was among the top disciples of the three sects, he was older than most, and in truth, he was not exceptionally outstanding.

Aside from these few at the forefront, the remaining disciples from the three sects were mostly around the thousandth layer.

Yang Kai and the Hu sisters were positioned in the lower-middle ranks.

Many others still struggled below the thousand layers, each step consuming significant energy, requiring long rests before they could advance again.

Yet, this arduous journey was also a tremendous benefit for those individuals. The trials contained within the staircase not only selected candidates for inheritance but also rewarded those who persevered and pressed forward with benefits along the way.

This was a tempering of one’s mindset.

Lan Chudie was also struggling on the hundred-layer staircase. This stunningly beautiful woman, with an alluring figure, had her long hair covered in frost, shivering all over, yet she gritted her teeth, refusing to show any sign of discouragement.

Every time she recalled Yang Kai’s cold, emotionless gaze, a pang of bitterness welled up within her.

Her fists clenched tightly as she gasped for breath, stepping onto a new layer of the staircase.

She was ambitious and willing to rely on the strong, but was that wrong? She was merely a woman! Her aptitude was not particularly remarkable, and after diligently cultivating in Lingxiao Pavilion, she had only reached the Qi Movement – Seventh Stage. What did this level of strength mean in the eyes of those powerful individuals?

She sought to rely on the strong merely to find a support for herself; it was just a way for a woman to live well.

She was not Su Yan, not the dazzling daughter of heaven who attracted countless gazes. Aside from her intellect, she had nothing else to depend on.

Perhaps her body, which made men drool and women envious, was seen as an asset by outsiders, but Lan Chudie had never regarded it as her capital. If possible, she would rather not have such a body and appearance.

Letting men covet and women envy!

More than ten days ago, at that critical moment for that person, she had remained silent and chose not to help him. Perhaps if she had spoken a good word for him back then, he would not have looked at her with such eyes later.

Heh, petty junior brother! Why can’t you be a little more magnanimous?

No one could be relied upon; only by becoming stronger could one be truly powerful!

A surge of energy suddenly erupted from Lan Chudie’s body, swirling around her. She was momentarily taken aback, then her face blossomed into a radiant smile.

In the midst of her chaotic thoughts, she had inadvertently broken through her realm, reaching the Qi Movement – Eighth Stage.

Closing her eyes, she felt the changes brought by her breakthrough, and Lan Chudie’s spirit soared.

Let her grow stronger here quickly.

Once again, she moved her steps, feeling even lighter and quicker than before. Lan Chudie’s heart soared with joy.

After resting for half a day, Yang Kai and the Hu sisters advanced once more.

Beyond the thousand layers, the pressure they felt was distinctly different from before; the energy contained within each layer was significantly greater. At first, the sisters did not need to rest much, but as they progressed, the duration of their pauses grew longer.

Yang Kai was no different.

Though he cultivated the True Yang Technique, his strength was still too low to traverse these steps as effortlessly as Su Yan.

Thus, the trio’s pace was not very fast, and none of them hindered the others.

They persevered through to the two thousandth layer before they finally stopped to rest again.

Throughout this journey, the energy contained within every five hundred layers varied, with the alternating cold and heat presenting a challenge that required them to adapt quickly to the opposing energy impacts.

This not only consumed their physical strength but also tested their mental fortitude.

The Hu sisters were both panting heavily, their chests rising and falling, while Yang Kai remained calm. Although he had also expended energy, the Yang Liquid stored in his Dantian was sufficient to handle the current situation.

“Aren’t you tired?” Hu Jiao’er couldn’t help but glance at Yang Kai. Since stepping onto this staircase, he had shown no signs of fatigue, leaving her puzzled.

If it weren’t for the opportunity they had previously obtained, Hu Jiao’er believed her sister would never have made it this far; she would have been stopped below the thousand layers.

Yet Yang Kai was only at the Open Origin Realm; throughout this journey, she had not seen him consume any pills. How could he possibly have so much energy to spare?

“I’m fine.” Yang Kai sat on the staircase, recovering his strength and spirit, responding casually.

“Monster!” Hu Jiao’er let out a bitter laugh.
