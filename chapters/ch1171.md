## Chapter 1171 — Very Brave

Before that scarred man could make another move, Yang Kai sent a punch of his own, striking the scarred man's face squarely.

Another muffled crack rang out as the scarred man was blasted into the air, spinning several times before crashing heavily to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.

He was a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; if not for losing his composure the moment his junior brother was struck, he would never have been so easily felled by Yang Kai—at the very least he should have been able to parry a few blows.

But his carelessness allowed Yang Kai to land that decisive hit.

The whole incident unfolded in the blink of an eye—from the First Stage Saint King Realm martial artist lunging at Yang Kai to the scarred man being knocked to the ground was scarcely a single breath.

The sudden turn of events chilled the other onlookers who had been watching in silence; incredulity shone in all their eyes.

A First Stage Saint King Realm fighter struck a Third Stage Saint King Realm warrior clean off with one punch? Even allowing for a lapse in the latter's attention, he shouldn't have been so utterly helpless.

"What family does this brat come from? How can he be so fierce?"

"Good thing I didn't go over just now—otherwise I'd have the same end as Yin Jianzhong."

"He's finished. He looks tough, but attacking Yin Jianzhong in front of so many Qingque Sect disciples—what a fool. His whole family is done for!"

Whispering voices rose from those groups.

The nearly thirty members of Qingque Sect grew cold-faced and all stood, glaring at Yang Kai with hostile expressions; some, seized by righteous indignation, were already charging over.

Among the Qingque Sect, the sole elder leading them—at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—stared grimly in this direction. Confident in his status, he did not move, but he made no effort to restrain his disciples' commotion.

Clearly he intended to let the disciples teach Yang Kai a lesson.

In the space of a blink, Yang Kai found himself surrounded by thirty warriors, all leering at him; many let out uncanny chuckles that sounded chilling.

The scarred man called Yin Jianzhong struggled up from the ground, his face still showing shock—he had not expected to suffer such a humbling defeat at Yang Kai's hands. As he rose his face went pale and flushed in turns.

Meanwhile the wail of the Saint King Realm martial artist whose arm Yang Kai had twisted into a snapped ruin grew increasingly pitiful.

"Don't anyone move!" Yin Jianzhong roared, halting his fellows' plan to swarm and beat Yang Kai. He rubbed his blurred eyes and glared at Yang Kai with murderous intent.

He intended to personally wash away this humiliation and restore his pride.

"You brat, you really have guts. I was going to bargain with you fair and square; if you refused fine—but you dare strike from behind?" Yin Jianzhong rolled his neck, refusing to admit his defeat was due to his own shortcomings, instead slandering it as a sneak attack by Yang Kai.

Hearing that, many showed expressions of sudden realization, thinking that indeed Yin Jianzhong must have been ambushed, which could explain his swollen eyes.

"Bargain?" Yang Kai laughed, his expression hardening. He barked, "You mean force me into buying?"

Yin Jianzhong's face flickered uneasily; he ceased quibbling over that point and snorted coldly, "Brat, spare the words. You dared injure my junior brother—today I won't let you leave unscathed!"

As he spoke, Saint Yuan surged through Yin Jianzhong's body and a ruler-like secret treasure materialized in his hand.

Yang Kai's punch had taught him a lesson. This First Stage Saint King Realm fighter clearly wasn't quite right, so he immediately produced his treasure, hoping to finish things quickly and avoid further humiliation; if he took more losses he would have no excuse left to cover his incompetence.

A mere disciple from a small family, with no elder leading his group—if he killed him here, at worst they'd pay some Saint Crystal compensation afterward; perhaps not even that.

Yin Jianzhong paid no heed to any force behind Yang Kai.

But before he could make a move, hearty laughter suddenly rolled in from afar, drawing rapidly closer: “How amusing! I, Wei, have only been gone for a short while, and already someone dares to bully those of my Yingyue Hall?”

"Yingyue Hall?" Yin Jianzhong's face changed; he scanned Yang Kai in surprise, his eyes showing some panic.

The nearly thirty Qingque Sect disciples encircling Yang Kai also changed expression in unison.

Not far off, Wei Guchang was shrouded in black mist as he strode over. In his hand he toyed with a pitch-black orb of energy as if it were solid—an orb that radiated terrifying power.

An almost suffocating aura emanated from him, causing every Qingque Sect disciple's face to darken.

Close at his side, Dong Xuan'er also carried a faint, mysterious energy; gentle wind arcs danced around her delicate figure like fluttering butterflies, lending her an ethereal beauty.

"Are you from Yingyue Hall?" Yin Jianzhong no longer dared underestimate Yang Kai and hastily asked.

"It doesn't matter to you, but I'll tell you anyway—I am not of Yingyue Hall," Yang Kai sneered at him. "If you want to act, then act. Don't worry about Yingyue Hall avenging you."

The once domineering Yin Jianzhong immediately became like a mouse before a cat the moment Wei Guchang uttered the words "Yingyue Hall."

Hearing Yang Kai's taunt, Yin Jianzhong's face displayed a riot of emotions; though he couldn't swallow his pride entirely, he dared not show too much hostility toward Yang Kai.

Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er walked straight up and the Qingque Sect disciples before them instinctively parted, clearing a path that let Wei reach Yang Kai with ease.

"Brother Yang, are you all right?" Wei Guchang eyed Yang Kai and only relaxed when he saw he was unhurt.

Although Qian Tong had told him Yang Kai could kill a Third Stage Saint King Realm fighter, hearing is never like seeing; Wei Guchang did not truly know Yang Kai's level. Now seeing Yang Kai remain calm while thirty men stared him down, Wei was secretly astonished.

Without ability, one could not appear so composed—who has the confidence to escape an ambush by thirty Saint King Realm fighters?

"You arrived a tad early, Brother Wei," Yang Kai shook his head slowly.

Wei Guchang was surprised. He suddenly realized Yang Kai was not a man to be trifled with; he almost seemed eager to take on the Qingque Sect.

"Wei Guchang—it's him, Wei Guchang!" Someone from the Qingque Sect surrounding group recognized Wei and called out in a low exclamation.

Though they'd never met, Wei had just claimed to be of Yingyue Hall and introduced himself as Wei; there were no other Saint King Realm figures of such aura and presence besides Wei Guchang.

Moreover, a woman accompanied him; rumor had it Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er were inseparable—if the Qingque Sect people still couldn't guess Wei's identity after seeing this, they'd be blind.

In the Dark Star's younger generation, Fang Tianzhong, Qu Changfeng, Yin Sudie, Wei Guchang, Dong Xuan'er, and several other excellent youths had very loud reputations; Wei Guchang, however, was less ostentatious than Qu Changfeng—so low-key that many Yingyue Hall disciples knew his name but had never seen him.

Yet that did nothing to lessen his aura of intimidation.

Learning it was Wei Guchang, Yin Jianzhong's expression shifted, bitterness filling his mouth.

Had he known this beforehand, he wouldn't have brought his junior brother to find Yang Kai about buying a pass to Flowing Flame Sandland—he would have avoided them; how could he have handed himself over to be humiliated?

Unlike Yin's regret, those who had considered going to Yang Kai but were beaten to it by Yin Jianzhong now secretly rejoiced—if Yin hadn't been so quick, the one embarrassed now would be them, not Qingque Sect.

"Brother Yang, what's happened?" Wei Guchang asked, curious. He and Dong Xuan'er had only been away a short while to greet Senior Uncle Wang and Senior Uncle Yan; returning, they found Yang Kai surrounded.

Yang Kai didn't seem the sort to court trouble.

"Oh, this fellow brought his junior brother to buy a pass to Flowing Flame Sandland. Wei Brother, what exactly is a pass? I don't think you've told me?" Yang Kai regarded Wei Guchang with a puzzled look.

"Uh… I forgot," Wei Guchang scratched his head and felt embarrassed. "Can't blame me—I've not yet received a pass myself; they're with Elder Qian. When he arrives he'll distribute them. When the Flowing Flame Sandland entrance opens, those entering must hold a pass; the seniors will only allow entry to those with one. These passes are specially made by the great forces' experts and can't be forged. Also, Elder Qian will hand out a thing called a Yuan Magnetic Pointer to us later—it's what we use inside Flowing Flame Sandland to find direction."

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Wei Guchang himself hadn't received the items, so he couldn't explain more—he likely thought it wasn't a big deal and Yang Kai would learn when Qian Tong arrived.

The two chatted casually while the Qingque Sect disciples bristled like spines, their faces ugly.

Those lads clearly didn't take them seriously—otherwise why would they chat so nonchalantly about passes and Yuan Magnetic Pointers?

After finally waiting for Wei Guchang and Yang Kai to finish speaking, Yin Jianzhong’s expression flickered with hesitation. Then, forcing a look of friendliness, he cupped his fists and said, “So it was Brother Guchang of Yingyue Hall—”

“‘Brother Guchang’? You think you’re qualified to call me that?” Wei Guchang cut him off before he could finish. His domineering tone and utter disregard for decorum made Yin Jianzhong’s face flush crimson with anger, his eyes nearly bulging—yet he dared not utter a word of protest.

Although many present were Third Stage Saint King Realm, Yin Jianzhong knew that in a fight with Wei Guchang he would fall in only a few moves. These famed young talents were all prodigies of monstrous talent.

Yin Jianzhong had at least some self-awareness.
