## Chapter 1601 — This Place Is Not Allowed

Hearing this, the leading man frowned and said, displeased: "I don't want to be too far from Domain Stone Mountain — what's the use of being too far away? I want a position on the innermost layer."

"Then you'll have to take it by force!" the man surnamed Cai sneered.

"Have you found a target we can act on yet?"

"Already found one." The man surnamed Cai said as he glanced back toward where Yang Kai and the others were, chuckling lowly, "And the position's not bad."

The leading man cast a look at where Yang Kai was and immediately displayed a satisfied expression, nodding: "That spot really is good. This is the place."

"They might not give it up." The man surnamed Cai chuckled; sensing Yang Kai's gaze fixed on them, he turned and glared coldly, "That brat seems to have been watching us all along."

“Since we’ve set our sights on it, they’ll yield whether they want to or not!” The leader snorted coldly, met Yang Kai’s gaze head-on, and strode forward.

The other five trailed closely behind, their auras razor-sharp.

In a brief moment the six arrived three zhang in front of where Yang Kai and the others sat. The leading man looked down from above and coldly asked, "Boy, where are you from?"

Yang Kai grinned and replied lightly, "From Dark Star."

"Dark Star?" The leader frowned and curled his lip, "Never heard of it. I've chosen this place — move out quickly, or don't blame us for being rude."

Yang Kai sat on the ground, idly picked his ear, blew out a breath and said, "Sorry, I didn't hear what you said — could you repeat that?"

The leading man let out a cold laugh. “You’ve got guts, kid. I believes you’re not deaf, so I won’t repeat myself. If you know what’s good for you, get lost—unless you’re tired of living!”

The five behind him emitted low, malicious laughs, their threat plain.

"What is all this about? Gentlemen, if you have matters to discuss, speak properly — no need to fly into a rage." Zhao Tianze suddenly stood up, his face full of helplessness.

Although Yang Kai had said he would act as bodyguard and allow him to contemplate the mysteries emanating from the Domain Stone Mountain, Zhao Tianze could not comfortably entrust his life to a stranger. No matter how highly Qian Tong and Lin Yurao praised him, to Zhao Tianze Yang Kai was still a stranger.

And a stranger who was a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm! So he had not relaxed his vigilance. The moment there was any movement here he noticed it and hurriedly stepped forward to smooth things over.

"I am Zhao Tianze, city lord of Lushui City on Cuiwei Star — greetings, friends. May I ask your names?" Zhao Tianze forced a dry laugh and cupped his hands.

The leading man glanced at Zhao Tianze, then at Yang Kai, and quietly judged that the one in charge must be Zhao Tianze; the lower-ranking Yang Kai was merely following orders. His expression eased, and in a deep voice he said, "I am Zhang Qing of Fire Radiance Sect on Chi Lan Star. These are my friends and fellow disciples from Chi Lan Star!"

"Chi Lan Star? Fire Radiance Sect?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow — at last he remembered why it sounded familiar.

Earlier, when he encountered Xu Dingyang who had been torn apart by a Domain, Xu Dingyang had said he was from Chi Lan Star, and Yang Kai had thought it strange; he had the vague sense he'd heard the name of that cultivation star before.

Hearing Zhang Qing's self-introduction now, he immediately understood.

Years ago in the Imperial Garden he had met martial artists from Chi Lan Star.

And there had been two contingents.

One group was from the Fire Radiance Sect and the other from Ice Heart Valley. The two sides had been fighting to the death over the ownership of an ancient cave; Yang Kai happened to pass by and was drawn in.

In the end Yang Kai had even taken part, helping women from Ice Heart Valley kill several warriors of the Fire Radiance Sect.

The True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy and the Purple Void Cauldron had both been obtained from that hidden ancient cave.

No wonder the man surnamed Cai's clothes looked familiar — they had dealings before! Yang Kai grinned, a playfully teasing expression on his face.

"So you are friends of the Fire Radiance Sect!" Zhao Tianze's face shifted and he hurriedly said, "My apologies, my apologies."

He had obviously heard the name of the Fire Radiance Sect.

Zhang Qing wore a proud expression and nodded lightly, "Since friends have heard of my Fire Radiance Sect, this is easy. Tell your companions to clear out and give up the spot. I don't wish to be too ruthless — if you withdraw willingly I guarantee not a hair on your heads will be harmed."

"Well..." Zhao Tianze's face turned bitter; he stammered, "Brother Zhang, forgive me — I cannot decide this alone. Allow me to discuss it with these friends first."

"There's nothing to discuss. This place is not for you; go find another spot." Lin Yurao's gentle yet firm voice rang out.

She and Qian Tong had already been alerted and had sat coldly watching; now that Zhao Tianze spoke they naturally would not yield.

Her and Qian Tong's determination to reach the Void King Realm was the same!

"Isn't this going too far?" Qian Tong's face darkened like deep water as he cast a cold look at Zhang Qing and the others.

"Too far?" Zhang Qing sneered, "I don't think so. I'm giving you a chance to live — it's up to you whether you seize it."

"If you keep yammering, I'll kill you all!" the man surnamed Cai barked, his expression growing impatient.

"Everyone calm down, calm down." Zhao Tianze, his face creased with worry, signaled to Qian Tong and Lin Yurao to hold their tongues, then addressed Zhang Qing, "Brother Zhang, please wait a moment. I'll speak with them and give you an answer shortly!"

"Fine! Since you are at least half the local master, I'll give you that face. Time is short — half a cup of tea from now I want an answer!" Zhang Qing warned coldly.

Zhao Tianze sighed bitterly in agreement and leaned toward Qian Tong and Lin Yurao, helpless: "You two, do you truly not wish to yield?"

Qian Tong looked at him indifferently: "What, Brother Zhao, are you planning to withdraw from here?"

Zhao Tianze slowly shook his head: "If it were possible, how would I willingly leave? But they are many and powerful; if we don't follow their will, there'll be no good result."

Qian Tong's brows twitched in surprise: "Brother Zhao, your courage isn't usually so small. After all, you're a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — you've weathered storms before. Why be so fearful of the Fire Radiance Sect? What are they that you dread them so?"

Zhao Tianze's mouth twitched as he bitterly smiled, "Elder Qian, you noticed? I won't hide it — I do fear them. The Fire Radiance Sect is from Chi Lan Star; in principle they have nothing to do with our Cuiwei Star, but their Grand Elder seems to have a good relationship with the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star! These people we simply cannot afford to offend."

Qian Tong and Lin Yurao both narrowed their eyes.

Having lived on Cuiwei Star for two or three years, they naturally knew there was a powerful Star Lord there — a formidable figure, a Second Stage Void King.

"Do you understand now?" Zhao Tianze looked at them anxiously.

"Understood. As for whether we retreat, I'll follow the Sect Master — if he tells me to withdraw I'll withdraw; if he tells me to stay I'll stay!" Lin Yurao lifted her eyes toward Yang Kai.

"Listening to him..." Zhao Tianze's face fell; he had never expected the final decision would lie with Yang Kai.

"Yang Kai, you tell us whether to stay or leave!" Qian Tong turned his gaze toward him as well, "I'll stand with you!"

"Do we need to retreat?" Yang Kai curled his lip, "Of course we stay. How could we miss such a prime opportunity? As for those people... don't worry — if they want to die, I'll arrange it for them!"

"With those words I can rest easy." Qian Tong chuckled lowly, and Lin Yurao's expression brightened.

"You..." Zhao Tianze was truly speechless, staring at Yang Kai, "Have you not grasped the situation? If you insist on courting death, why drag Elder Qian and Elder Lin into it? They've entrusted their lives to you — at least be responsible. Don't have a mouth bigger than heaven; in the end the one who suffers will be you."

He was clearly angry now, and spoke to Yang Kai with far less courtesy.

"If Lord Zhao finds it improper, he himself may leave." Yang Kai looked at him indifferently, "I didn't force you to stay and share life and death with us!"

Zhao Tianze was choked with anger, pointed at Yang Kai repeatedly, but could not form a word.

Zhang Qing and the others watched the scene and could not help laughing.

They suddenly found these four rather amusing — in the face of imminent disaster they were not united but were bickering among themselves; truly foolish.

"I won't haggle with you!" Zhao Tianze nearly boiled over with anger at Yang Kai. Looking to Qian Tong and Lin Yurao he said, “You two, come with me. Otherwise, they definitely won’t show any mercy.”

Qian Tong sighed: "Brother Zhao, we've worked together for years — I know your character and that you mean well. But there's no need to talk further; you go ahead and withdraw."

Lin Yurao pressed her lips into a smile. “No need to go too far—who knows, you might be coming back here before long.”

Zhao Tianze was stunned.

He clearly understood the meaning hidden in Lin Yurao's words, but he simply could not believe it.

Casting a cold glance at Yang Kai, Zhao Tianze sighed, "I don't know why Elder Qian and Elder Lin have such complete confidence in you, but I hope you know what you're doing."

With that he turned and walked out, despondent.

He had done what he could; Qian Tong and Lin Yurao would not heed his admonitions and he was helpless.

He had no stomach to stay and help Qian Tong and Lin Yurao resist their foes, and could only leave in sorrow.

Zhang Qing and the others looked on coldly; no explanation was needed — they already knew the result.

Indeed, they did not trouble Zhao Tianze further; instead they surged forward together, glaring down at Yang Kai and the other three.

"It seems you won't learn until you see your own coffin," Zhang Qing sneered, his eyes sharp as blades and his tone hostile, "Don't blame me for not giving you a chance — this is your own doing."

As he spoke, an extremely fierce field of Shi suddenly spread out, descending upon Yang Kai and the three of them!
