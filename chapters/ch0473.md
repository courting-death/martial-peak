## Chapter 473 — None of You Serve Yang Kai?

Though he spoke those words aloud, Tao Yang felt uneasy in his heart.

All the people from Ghost King Valley were young disciples, none even reaching the Divine Roaming Realm. Meanwhile, although a few from Baoqi Sect had attained the Divine Roaming Realm and carried a dazzling array of treasured artifacts, they would certainly not be a match for those other groups once a real fight broke out.

If only he could secretly send someone to pass a message to Yang Kai. Tao Yang believed that as soon as Yang Kai knew the situation here, he would surely bring a large force to meet them. With Yang Kai in charge, entering War City would certainly be effortless.

But right now, there was no chance for him to send out a messenger.

“Senior Brother Tao, I’m sorry to trouble you and cause Senior Wu’s reprimand,” Leng Shan said guiltily. She, Shen Yi, and the others had no other choice but to seek out Tao Yang. After all, when they escaped from the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, Tao Yang and his group had stayed in Ghost King Valley for some time, so they were somewhat familiar.

“It’s nothing. Senior Aunt only scolded me verbally. She wouldn’t really expel me from the Sect,” Tao Yang smiled faintly, waving his hand.

The Baoqi Sect had few members, no more than a hundred in total. Every generation’s disciples were rigorously selected, even more strictly than those chosen by Yao Wang Valley.

Yet every disciple of Baoqi Sect possessed unparalleled talent and achievements in the art of refining artifacts, and Tao Yang was one of the top figures among them in this generation.

The future prosperity of Baoqi Sect rested on him. How could Wu Yan truly bear to expel him?

As he spoke, Tao Yang’s expression darkened. Surrounded by five escort groups on all sides, it might seem impressive, but in truth it was a helpless frustration.

They couldn’t win in a fight. They couldn’t explain their situation adequately. Others would never listen to their words.

Moreover, as time passed and they drew closer to War City, the five groups gradually lost patience. Their exchanged glances carried the ominous tension of a brewing storm.

The Baoqi Sect’s position, after all, was not as stable and elevated as that of Yao Wang Valley. No one dared offend those from Yao Wang Valley when they traveled.

Yet despite Baoqi Sect’s fame, some still looked down upon them.

In recent years, countless major powers had tried openly and secretly to annex Baoqi Sect, with conspiracies and assassinations emerging continuously.

Fortunately, Baoqi Sect had built considerable connections and always managed to narrowly escape disaster.

Still, this could not continue indefinitely. They needed the protection of a transcendental power in order to survive.

This was exactly why the Baoqi Sect’s upper echelons had approved Tao Yang’s participation in the succession war. As long as the terms with Yang Kai were settled, helping him was not impossible.

The group flew onward for another half-hour. Now only eight hundred li away from War City.

At this distance, the five groups sent out by the Yang Family’s young masters were already showing signs of impatience, exchanging looks that clearly intended to initiate conflict.

Both Baoqi Sect and Ghost King Valley sensed the abnormal Qi atmosphere, their expressions suddenly firming as they prepared for battle.

Sure enough, from the left group, a Divine Roaming Realm expert who had spoken before snorted coldly: “Mr. Wu, it looks like your sect is determined to shelter these heretical people. Since you refuse to hand them over, we must offend you. If we cause any offense later, please understand, Mr. Wu!”

Wu Yan’s expression darkened. He shouted angrily, “What do you intend to do?”

The man chuckled lightly, “Good and evil cannot coexist. We merely wish to punish the wicked! Mr. Wu had better keep your disciples in check. If not, any accidental injuries during combat will be on you.”

Wu Yan sneered, “I’m afraid all these youngsters behind me are already heretics, aren’t they? Whether they fight back or not, you’ll seize them all.”

“How could that be?” The man shook his head. “At least your sect’s eldest disciple Tao Yang, I’m sure of. Whether the others are heretics remains to be seen; we’ll find out by interrogating them properly once we capture them.”

At this point, everyone understood that these people intended to use the pretext of cracking down on Ghost King Valley to target Baoqi Sect. They would not kill, only capture disciples to serve the Yang Family’s young masters.

Besides, if a fight broke out, would Tao Yang and the others refrain from action? Once they fought, the opposing side would have more justification to seize them.

The twists and turns were already clear.

Wu Yan’s face turned stern as he whispered, “It seems Baoqi Sect cannot avoid this ordeal. If a fight breaks out, run if you can; if not, do not resist. They won’t kill. Tao Yang, go to War City and find that Yang Kai. Have him handle this matter.”

“I will remember!” Tao Yang replied gravely.

“Tell him, if even one disciple of Baoqi Sect is harmed, don’t expect me to refine any artifacts for him ever again!” Wu Yan reiterated.

“Looks like you’ve made up your mind, Mr. Wu,” the man urged with a humph, “If so, we must offend you!”

At his words, the five groups launched almost simultaneously, targeting the Baoqi Sect disciples in the crowd.

Baoqi Sect had brought more than twenty people this time—a decent number when divided among them. At least when they returned to War City, they could explain to the Yang Family’s young masters.

Both Baoqi Sect and Ghost King Valley suddenly halted during their flight, intending to scatter and find escape paths in accordance with Wu Yan’s orders, when suddenly a figure appeared above them.

This person appeared strangely, no one seeing how he manifested, as if he had concealed himself, floating invisibly overhead.

When this figure appeared, a terrifying Divine Sense force immediately blanketed the area.

The five approaching groups fell silent, all showing expressions as if their souls were about to be extinguished. They hastily activated their True Yuan to resist the dreadful pressure; their eyes trembled violently in disbelief as they gazed at the newcomer.

In contrast, Baoqi Sect and Ghost King Valley’s people looked on suspiciously and with confusion.

Especially Leng Shan, who felt a slight fluctuation transmitted into her mind when this person appeared. By the time she reacted and sought to investigate further, the sensation vanished.

Fixing her gaze on the middle-aged man in midair, Leng Shan furrowed her brows.

The man casually glanced at her, giving an affable smile before turning his gaze away.

His eyes grew cold, exuding a fierce, brutal, bloodthirsty, and sinister aura. The middle-aged man sneered wickedly, “Bullying the few by the many, how amusing!”

His attitude was puzzling—neither friendly nor hostile—more like a powerful expert passing through, occasionally stopping to observe a spectacle.

No one dared respond. Under that terrifying Divine Sense force, the slightest movement or change in expression might invite dire consequences.

The scene froze instantly, the five groups’ faces extremely grim, treading on thin ice and daring not to move. Their eyes looked at the middle-aged man with fear and respect, beads of sweat rolling down their foreheads.

“All mute?” The man’s expression turned severe as he shouted coldly.

His voice was like thunder cracking beside their ears, making eardrums ring and forcing everyone to step back several paces. When they looked ahead again, their expressions deepened their horror.

If no one spoke to break the stalemate now, the matter could spiral out of control.

Realizing this, the strongest among the five groups exchanged glances. Nevertheless, the man from the left forced himself, respectfully cupping his fist, and asked, “May I ask your honorable name? We are from Leizhou Dingguang Sect…”

Before he finished, the middle-aged man interrupted, frowning, displeased: “Dingguang Sect? Never heard of it!”

Dingguang Sect was a first-rate force, yet the man treated it as if it were a low-tier sect. Still, no anger showed; instead, he smiled and said, “Currently serving Zhongdu Yang Family’s Second Young Master.”

He hoped that invoking the Second Young Master’s name might cause the man to withdraw, considering the middle-aged man’s vast power and his evident disdain for Dingguang Sect.

“Second Young Master?” The man’s expression turned interested. “What is the Second Young Master’s name?”

“Yang Zhao!” The other answered smiling, relief washing over his face, thinking his words had the desired effect.

“And what about the rest of you?” The middle-aged man turned to the other groups.

They hurried to report which sect they belonged to and which young master they served.

Unexpectedly, the middle-aged man’s smile gradually faded upon hearing their words, darkening until his mood was as foreboding as a storm before it breaks.

This was bad! They read his expression and all felt their hearts grow cold, palms and soles drenched in sweat.

“You folks don’t seem to serve Yang Kai, do you?” The middle-aged man’s lips curled into a cold smile, sharp as a blade.

“Senior, we are here to help Yang Kai,” Tao Yang quickly cupped his fists, his eyes shifting as he caught the subtle implication.

“Hmm?” The man looked down, his expression softening slightly, then laughed heartily. “Good, good, only you have the sense, kid. Work well with Yang Kai. Your day to shine will come!”

“Thank you for your praise, Senior!” Tao Yang beamed.

Wu Yan shot a cold glare at him. Tao Yang’s earlier display was nothing but a lifer’s flattery, a groveling sycophant. It was a disgrace to Baoqi Sect!

“Excellent, since you come to join Yang Kai, I can’t just sit idly by.” The middle-aged man nodded gently, waving his large hand, “I will take responsibility for your safety!”

Hearing this, both Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect members revealed pleased expressions. They had not expected such a powerful expert to appear and protect them at this critical moment and were instantly grateful.

Meanwhile, the five groups’ expressions dimmed. None dared act rashly again. Having experienced his Divine Sense power, they all knew well he was not one to be trifled with.

The man who spoke earlier cupped his fists, forcing a smile: “Since you’ve intervened, we won’t disturb you further. Farewell!”

At the same time, they waved and cautiously retreated.
