## Chapter 1667 — Artifact Spirit's Change

"Young Hero Yang, where is the Qiantian Thunderflame now?" Luo Li asked again, curiosity in her voice.

Yang Kai pointed down toward the magma: "It's still down there for the moment, but I don't think it will last much longer."

Luo Li's body trembled, a flash of horror appearing in her beautiful eyes.

She of course knew how ferocious the Qiantian Thunderflame was, but from Yang Kai's words she gathered that he possessed the means to extinguish that murderous blaze — a notion that far exceeded Luo Li's expectations.

In her estimation, Yang Kai might be capable of restraining the Qiantian Thunderflame long enough for her to act freely against the Fire Radiance Sect.

So after she finished dealing with matters at the Fire Radiance Sect, she immediately rushed here, prepared to lend Yang Kai a hand.

She had not expected that there was nothing here for her to do at all.

"Young Hero Yang's methods are peerless; I am truly impressed," Luo Li said in genuine admiration. Even if she herself struck, she could not be certain of eradicating that ferocious flame, yet Yang Kai had that capability.

"You overpraise me, Senior."

"Since there is nothing left here, I shall take my leave. If the young hero has leisure in the future, do come visit Ice Heart Valley; the entire Ice Heart Valley will surely welcome you."

"If there is a chance." Yang Kai gave no definite reply.

Luo Li acted without delay and quickly departed.

After Luo Li left, another figure shot down from the volcanic crater, carrying a refreshing chill of ice with her, and settled beside Yang Kai.

It was Su Yan.

Yang Kai turned his head, reached out, and caught her small hand, gently playing with her palm between his fingers.

Su Yan said nothing; a calm smile graced her face as she gazed at the roiling magma ahead and rested her head on Yang Kai's shoulder, an expression of contentment upon her features.

The Senior Sister and Junior Brother at last found time in this moment to enjoy the warmth of each other's company.

"Junior Brother, where shall we go next?" Su Yan asked after a long pause.

"To Dark Star."

"Dark Star? Where is that?"

"Dark Star is very, very far away, but it is much better than the present Tongxuan Continent in many respects. Although there exists a strange suppressing heaven-and-earth law there, it is well suited for people from the Tongxuan Continent to develop. We have a Lingxiao Sect there that possesses a treasured land…"

Yang Kai described the many virtues of Dark Star, and Su Yan could not help but grow a sense of longing for that place.

Amidst the vast Star Domain, with boundless horizons, destination mattered little so long as the man at her side accompanied her; even the ends of the world would be home.

In that instant, Su Yan felt a contentment she had never known.

The struggle between the Fire Bird and the Qiantian Thunderflame seemed to have continued for a very long time.

Yang Kai and Su Yan sat at the crater for half a month, yet the contest below showed no decisive victor.

It was Bing Long who came by and handed Yang Kai many Spatial Rings; the items inside were all spoils originally belonging to the Fire Radiance Sect: precious ores, medicinal ingredients, finished secret treasures, pills, martial manuals, Saint Crystals numbering in the hundreds of millions — a veritable cornucopia.

Ice Heart Valley owed its success in eliminating the Fire Radiance Sect this time to Yang Kai, and the wealth pillaged from the sect's main headquarters could not be hoarded by any one party. At Luo Li's instruction, Bing Long personally split that terrifying fortune in two: one share for Ice Heart Valley and the other exclusively for Yang Kai!

This was Ice Heart Valley's overture; they were attempting to mend the relationship between them.

Yang Kai understood this and naturally did not refuse; he readily accepted the Spatial Rings.

He was about to lead tens of thousands of people to Dark Star and would require vast cultivation resources. This fortune from the Fire Radiance Sect would be sufficient for people of the Tongxuan Continent for a decade or two without worry.

Though he did not leave the crater, Yang Kai could still probe the movements of those from Ice Heart Valley.

With the Fire Radiance Sect extinguished, the Fire Radiance Mountain Range had become unclaimed territory, and Ice Heart Valley cultivated ice techniques — clearly unsuitable for establishing a branch here.

However, they possessed many subsidiary sects, and some had already migrated these days to the Fire Radiance Mountain Range to reoccupy this treasure ground.

None of this concerned Yang Kai; to Chi Lan Star he would always be nothing more than a passing traveler.

During the waiting days, he and Su Yan spoke of everything, recounting what had happened to each of them over the past more than thirty years; even the smallest trivialities were listened to with rapt interest.

At times they sat in meditation to cultivate.

The two discovered that when they cultivated together, their speed increased by at least tenfold compared to when each trained alone.

Their Saint Yuan intertwined and fused, flowing ceaselessly like a surging river, frenziedly drawing Spiritual Qi from the nearby heaven and earth to pour into their bodies.

Time swept by, and another half month passed.

While cultivating, the two seemed to sense something at the same moment; they opened their eyes and looked downward.

Below them, the once-roaring magma began to show signs of calming, and the surrounding searing heat was rapidly diminishing at a visibly noticeable pace. The molten magma itself even seemed to be showing signs of solidifying.

It was as if something were absorbing all the heat within the volcanic mouth.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened; he formed a faint conjecture and watched with expectation.

Half a day later, the change grew more evident: the temperature at the crater had dropped to normal, such that even an ordinary person unaccustomed to cultivation would not feel great discomfort.

The roiling magma before them had already reached a semi-solid state.

A trace of aura rose rapidly from the depths below.

That aura felt familiar to Yang Kai, and a smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

Swoosh…

A streak of red shot out from below, and a Fire Bird roughly three zhang in length suddenly hovered in midair.

Its whole body radiated fiery red light, dazzling to behold, and purple lightning crackled over its form, exuding a domineering, destructive air.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, astonished at the Fire Bird's dramatic appearance and the intense aura emanating from its body.

The Fire Bird had undoubtedly succeeded in devouring the Qiantian Thunderflame and had undergone a soul evolution; the evolved bird was worlds apart from its former self — stronger by more than tenfold.

From the Fire Bird Yang Kai felt a pressure that only the Void King Realm could impose.

The Fire Bird could now rival the Void King Realm? Yang Kai's face brightened.

"Kriii…" The Fire Bird raised its head and issued a clear, resonant cry, seemingly exhilarated.

Then its form whirled, its wings folding in, and in a very short time its entire physique underwent a dramatic transformation.

A stunningly well-proportioned beauty with flaming red hair suddenly stood before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was dumbfounded in an instant!

Looking her over, the beauty was almost unreal in her loveliness: a perfectly shaped face, features as if crafted by fate with not a single flaw, long willow-leaf brows, a finely sculpted nose, and thin tender red lips shining like rubies, stirring boundless imagination.

Her figure was explosively alluring, her bosom full and round, her waist slender. Two long legs extended straight and graceful.

Most striking of all, her attire was equally provocative.

She wore armor of blazing red that barely covered her full bosom and the sensitive region from thigh to lower abdomen.

Tempting collarbones, a flat abdomen, a delicate navel exposed to the air, and from mid-thigh downward her skin was snow-white; her jade-like feet lightly pressed the void as if treading upon a man's very heart.

Yang Kai suddenly felt dizzy.

Su Yan also covered her mouth with her small hand in surprise, then, as if remembering something, smiled faintly and cast a meaningful glance at Yang Kai.

"Y-you… how did you become like this?" Yang Kai stammered, pointing at the evolved Fire Bird.

"Greetings, Master!" The Fire Bird suddenly bowed gracefully to Yang Kai and spoke with clear articulation.

Her voice was cool and aloof, hardly matching her voluptuous appearance, consonant with her indifferent expression.

Moreover, her voice carried an air of destruction and slaughter, as did her dark red, flame-like eyes.

Looking into her eyes, Yang Kai could even see a strange, blazing world — a heat so intense it seemed capable of melting a person's soul.

"You… you can speak?" Yang Kai was even more shocked, his mouth hanging wide.

The Fire Bird nodded, reflected for a moment, and then said: "After merging with that thing, I can now open my mouth to speak. What, Master doesn't like me in this form?"

"Should I like it?" Yang Kai's brow twitched subtly, and at the corner of his eye he saw Su Yan watching him with great interest and felt a bit sheepish.

"You should. I have followed the Master for many years and sense that the Master has such a taste, so…"

"Shut up!" Yang Kai exploded in anger, inhaled deeply, then turned to Su Yan and said earnestly: "This is slander, defamation; Senior Sister, please do not take it seriously."

Su Yan smiled faintly and replied with warm assurance, "Of course I believe Junior Brother."

"Then… it was my fault." The Fire Bird considered earnestly for a moment and, sincere in her apology, then solemnly bowed to Su Yan: "Greetings, Madam."

'The little one has good eyes!' Yang Kai cast the Fire Bird an approving look.

Su Yan pursed her lips in a smile, stepped forward, took the Fire Bird's hand and said: "No need for formalities. Your manifested appearance seems young, so from now on we'll call each other sisters. You've followed Junior Brother for many years and surely know what he has done over those years; when there's time we should have a proper talk."

"The Master probably wouldn't want me exposing his privacy, especially regarding certain women," the Fire Bird said, frowning and sounding somewhat reluctant.

Yang Kai's face turned as black as the bottom of a pot.

He suddenly realized he preferred the Fire Bird of before who obeyed him without question and did not think or speak of her own accord.

Now the Fire Bird's intelligence had grown greatly and her power had skyrocketed, yet he couldn't shake the feeling that he'd lost something.

"By the way, Junior Brother, she now has a human form — does she have a name?" Su Yan asked without prying into trivialities.

Yang Kai shook his head and looked at the Fire Bird: "Do you wish to have a name?"

A strange light flashed across the Fire Bird's eyes and she said in a deep voice: "Please, Master, bestow a name!"

A name is a token; only when given a name can one be considered a true sentient being!

"Then you'll be called Liu Yan." Yang Kai did not ponder long.
