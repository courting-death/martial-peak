## Chapter 1093 — Smashed?

Yu Feng laughed as he lightly tapped the blood-red crystal, making arrogant boasts.

Wu Yi nodded in agreement; Yu Feng possessed the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, was much older than her and had advanced later, but he had still reached that realm — if even his attacks could leave no mark on this crystal, then it truly must be extremely solid.

Yet no sooner had Yu Feng finished speaking than a faint crackling sounded. Following the noise, his laughter cut off like someone had gripped his throat; his eyes nearly bulged. He sprang in front of Wu Yi, shielding her behind his broad frame and stared at the blood-red crystal with utmost vigilance.

The martial artists gathered nearby all stiffened as if facing a great enemy; the relaxed air from before vanished.

Wu Yi poked her head out from behind Yu Feng's burly frame, and when she saw what had occurred she couldn't help but exclaim, "Yu Feng, did you break it?"

At that moment, the seemingly impenetrable crystal displayed crisscrossing, spiderweb-like fissures that rapidly spread outward; in only a few breaths the once clear crystal was riddled with cracks and seemed on the verge of shattering.

Yu Feng protested, "I didn't hit it that hard — who knew it was so fragile? Out there it wasn't like this; no matter how we struck it we couldn't leave a trace. Miss, step back; something's wrong."

Wu Yi gave a small nod and retreated a little, yet her wide eyes were fixed on the blood-colored crystal, eager to see what would happen next.

"Elder Chang Qi has arrived," someone cried excitedly.

Everyone turned and saw Elder Chang Qi, a man with a little goatee on his chin, hurrying over. They all saluted; when Chang Qi reached them and stood in place, Wu Yi asked, "Elder Chang Qi, do you know what this is? Why is there a person sealed inside?"

Chang Qi frowned and used his Divine Sense to probe; after a long moment he shook his head and said, "Miss, forgive my poor sight — I can't tell what material this is. Perhaps it isn't something produced near Dark Star."

"From outside?" Wu Yi's beautiful eyes brightened.

"It likely is."

Crack...

The already cracked blood-red crystal sounded again. Before everyone's eyes, the blood-red crystal stone suddenly exploded, shards scattering in all directions; the gathered warriors swore and hurriedly covered their faces.

The person sealed inside fell to the ground. He opened his eyes slowly, seemed to want to stand, but was utterly weak and collapsed back down onto his rear.

"He's alive?" Many warriors paled; even the usually insatiably curious Wu Yi's pretty face went deathly pale.

A person they had assumed long dead was, unbelievably, alive and well — a fact that exceeded everyone's comprehension.

Divine senses from all directions swept over the man; once they detected that there was not a trace of power in his body, everyone relaxed.

No power meant no threat; there was naturally no need to be on guard or afraid.

"This is not an ordinary person," Chang Qi said slowly. "An ordinary person couldn't be sealed in a crystal and emerge unscathed. He most likely only temporarily lost his power; I cannot tell what level his cultivation is. If he recovers..."

Yu Feng's face darkened as he stepped forward. Saint Yuan churned within him and he roared, "I'll kill him!"

The man within the blood-red crystal was of unknown realm and origin, and Yu Feng naturally dared not be careless.

"No need to kill him, right?" Wu Yi hurriedly stopped him. "He looks young; even if there's something odd, his cultivation won't be very high. Just restrain his freedom."

"Miss, you're curious about him?" Chang Qi glanced at Wu Yi thoughtfully.

"Isn't the Elder curious too?" Wu Yi pursed her lips and smiled; ignoring Yu Feng's protests she walked up to the man, crouched down and asked, "Can you understand us?"

When he gave an affirmative response, Wu Yi continued, "What's your name? Where are you from?"

"Yang Kai, I'm from Rainfall Star," Yang Kai answered honestly.

"Rainfall Star?" Wu Yi raised her brow. "Sure enough from outside — Rainfall Star is years away by travel. How did you get here?"

Yang Kai shook his head slowly. "I only remember going to a place and entering a blood-red pool. I accidentally triggered some sealing formation and passed out. When I woke up I was here."

Wu Yi pondered, "So you drifted here all the way?"

"I think so. What is this place?" Yang Kai frowned; being questioned like that made him uneasy.

"Kid, answer honestly — this isn't a place for you to be talking!" Yu Feng barked at Yang Kai, raising his massive fist as if prepared to beat him if he didn't cooperate.

"This place is near Dark Star."

Yang Kai shook his head again; he really had never heard of Dark Star.

"It's understandable you haven't heard of it — Dark Star is remote and many don't know of it. Ha, you're bold; you don't seem afraid at all," someone chuckled.

"Afraid of what? I don't think you mean me any harm," Yang Kai grinned.

"That's not certain — it depends on you. Haven't you heard the saying about a woman's heart being unfathomable? I might have you killed in the next moment. After all, we know nothing about you; we can't comfortably leave such a stranger on the warship," Wu Yi said coolly.

Yang Kai's smile vanished at once.

Wu Yi giggled softly and looked pleased. "That's better. Now tell me, what's your cultivation?"

"Third Stage of the Saint Realm."

At that everyone heaved a sigh of relief — a warrior at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm was not someone to be overly worried about. Even if Yang Kai were lying, given his age his strength couldn't be very high.

"I have many more questions, but you look exhausted. We'll stop for today. Yu Feng, take him down to rest and give him something to eat," Wu Yi said lightly; seeing Yang Kai's pale face she suppressed her curiosity.

Yu Feng nodded, hoisted Yang Kai up and headed off in a direction.

Before long they reached a room. Yu Feng kicked the door open, threw Yang Kai inside and snarled, "Kid, stay put and don't try anything. If I catch you plotting, I'll take your life!"

"Understood," Yang Kai nodded. "I'll behave."

Yu Feng turned to leave but suddenly looked back and asked, "What's in your Spatial Ring?"

"Some Saint Crystals and Pills," Yang Kai replied.

Yu Feng glanced around and, seeing no one nearby, was about to say more when Yang Kai proactively tossed the Spatial Ring to him.

Yu Feng caught it, swept his Divine Sense through it and immediately beamed. He nodded at Yang Kai and said, "Smart boy — wait here, I'll fetch you some good food."

With that, he disappeared.

Grinning, Yu Feng strode off. Though Wu Yi's insistence on keeping Yang Kai made him uneasy, the haul of Saint Crystals thrilled him.

Rounding a corner, he found Wu Yi standing there with a smile.

Yu Feng hurriedly clipped the Spatial Ring behind him and forced a smile.

"Hand it over!" Wu Yi held out a hand.

"What does Miss want?" Yu Feng feigned ignorance.

"The man's Spatial Ring — is it in your hands now?" Wu Yi asked with a shallow, charming smile.

Yu Feng sighed, hung his head like a beaten rooster and slowly placed Yang Kai's Spatial Ring into Wu Yi's hand, saying weakly, "Miss, can you stop being so clever? You make us men feel powerless."

“We’re not bandits. Why would we steal from others and make enemies for no reason? If everyone in the clan acted like you, how could our family hope to survive?” Wu Yi rebuked sharply.

Hearing that, Yu Feng's head drooped and he repeatedly clasped his hands to beg forgiveness.

Wu Yi didn't relent; she scolded him until he sincerely admitted his mistake and promised never to repeat it. Only then did she stop. After Yu Feng slunk away, her Divine Sense probed the Spatial Ring and a look of delight crossed her face: "No wonder they say outsiders have endless Saint Crystals. A Third Stage of the Saint Realm warrior can have so many Upper-Level Saint Crystals — it's outrageous. I can't just rob them, but having him give them to me should be fine; after all, I did save his life."

Muttering to herself for a while, Wu Yi pocketed the Spatial Ring with a clear conscience, planning to discuss its ownership with Yang Kai the next time they met.

In the room, Yang Kai wore a calm expression. The Spatial Ring on his hand was only a decoy — in the Star Domain, practically anyone with strength has a Spatial Ring.

The ring on Yang Kai's hand held less than five hundred Upper-Level Saint Crystals and a few bottles of common Pills; he wouldn't miss them if they were lost.

But the actions of that man called Yu Feng put him on guard. He groped inside his bosom and, after finding three Spatial Rings, let out a heavy breath.

Though he couldn't tell how much time had passed, the three Spatial Rings belonging to Guiche and the others were still intact and remained with him.

Listening carefully to ensure no one was watching, Yang Kai hurriedly transferred the contents of the three Spatial Rings into the Demon God's Secret Codex.

If the contents of those three rings were lost, Yang Kai would truly be distressed.

After completing all this, Yang Kai finally had time to check his own condition.

Since waking he had discovered that his body was empty — not a trace of Saint Yuan remained; it seemed his cultivation had been completely drained, and the thought sent a chill through him.

A warrior who had lost his cultivation was effectively an ordinary person.

After a careful examination, Yang Kai finally calmed himself.
