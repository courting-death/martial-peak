## Chapter 857 — The Same Power

The assembled powers swept their gazes around; Xueli herself sat in command nearby, convinced Yang Kai couldn't fly even with wings, so she wasn't in any hurry to act. She adopted the posture of an amused onlooker, delighted to watch these human experts turn on one another.

Yu Mo stood beside her, appearing languid, but his Divine Sense locked onto Yang Kai; if he detected any attempt to flee, he would immediately move to seal and kill.

Wu Jie, standing by Yang Kai's side, felt deeply uneasy at this deliberate targeting, as if a sharp sword were pressed against his throat.

"Saint Lord, I cannot help you with this matter. Although I won't serve that woman, if I stay I may very well die here… Do as you wish. When things get dangerous, I will retreat at once," Wu Jie said softly.

"Mm, don't worry about me." Yang Kai inclined his head slightly; his attitude toward Wu Jie softened a little. He didn't expect Wu Jie to aid him—he only hoped Wu Jie would at least not be like Zhang Ao and the others.

If he wanted to leave, he'd likely have to tear through space to escape beneath the eyes of someone as powerful as Xueli.

Whether he could succeed in escaping was another matter.

With Wu Jie's current strength, tearing the void once would exhaust him completely and carried a huge risk—failure would mean dying without a grave.

As for Yang Kai, he had already comprehended the true meaning of rending the void; his prospects were far better than Wu Jie's.

"Lady, shall we strike now?" Yu Mo sounded impatient as he whispered beside Xueli.

"Not yet! I want to talk to him properly first." Xueli laughed lightly, then called out to Yang Kai, "Boy, if you're sensible, don't resist. Come back to Sand City with me obediently; I won't take your life." Her expression darkened into menace. "But if you dare resist, you'll suffer. Breaking your hands and feet is the mildest punishment—who knows, I might even strip you of your cultivation!"

"Lady, don't dally with him—this brat's as slippery as an eel; once he finds an opportunity he's hard to catch…" Zhang Ao couldn't help shouting.

"Indeed, Lady, last time we chased him for months and still couldn't catch him. That boy is the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and wields the exquisite Nine Heavens Divine Technique. If we capture him and force out the method and their inheritance…" Cao Guan pressed the point, fearful of losing the chance.

Their previous assault on the Nine Heavens Sacred Land failed because they missed their chance and Yang Kai escaped with his life. That lesson had taught them to be more cautious.

"Shut up. When the Lady handles matters, you have no right to speak," Yu Mo snapped coldly at Zhang Ao.

Zhang Ao fell silent, resentful in his heart; his cultivation was higher than Yu Mo's, yet he had to swallow his pride and keep quiet.

"Do you think I came for that so-called Nine Heavens Divine Technique and its inheritance?" Xueli sneered at them. "What of it?"

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan were taken aback.

If it wasn't for those things, why would this woman have come all the way from the Demon Domain ten-odd thousand li away?

Yang Kai frowned and asked loudly, "Lady Xueli, I haven't done anything to offend you, have I? Although things in Sand City between us weren't pleasant, I did provide you with some benefits. Why are you pressing me so cruelly?"

This puzzled him most. No one like Xueli would leave the Demon Domain for so small a gain. What about him could possibly draw her?

"Want to know why?" Xueli smiled faintly.

Yang Kai's expression hardened and he nodded.

"Fine—since I've found you, and I'll need your help later, I might as well let you understand now." Xueli's tone turned congenial; by her words it seemed she would explain Yang Kai's doubts. The onlookers leaned forward, eager to hear.

Unexpectedly, Xueli waved her hand and a surging True Yuan poured out, isolating the others and leaving only Xueli, Yang Kai, and Yu Mo.

Yang Kai's face shifted. He looked around but saw nothing beyond a dark indigo veil overhead; even Wu Jie, who had been beside him, had vanished.

This woman's methods were indeed unfathomable, Yang Kai thought, unease written across his face.

Excitement glinted in Xueli's beautiful eyes. She flicked a jade finger and a strand of refined light shot toward Yang Kai—without any trace of killing intent.

Yang Kai frowned but did not dodge. The streak of light, like a righteous gale, brushed his arm as it flew past.

There was a faint, hissing sound.

A sting lanced Yang Kai's arm and blood, dark red threaded with golden sheen, welled forth. Yet the flesh around the wound writhed, and in an instant the wound had sealed.

"So it is!" Xueli's eyes burned with fanatic intensity as she stared at Yang Kai's wound and murmured.

Yu Mo standing beside her frowned deeply, puzzled.

"Aren't you curious why, as a demon commander, I would single you out?" Xueli asked.

Yang Kai nodded.

Xueli chuckled coquettishly, fluttering like a blossom. "Because the same power flows through our blood!"

Saying this, Xueli suddenly drew a blade across her own jade arm; a cut opened and blood flowed from the white skin.

"Lady…" Yu Mo cried out, then froze a moment later.

Xueli's blood shimmered with a faint golden light too, though far weaker compared to Yang Kai's.

Her wound, too, sealed slowly under some wondrous force, but far more slowly than Yang Kai's; the two were not comparable.

"Demon God Golden Blood?" Yang Kai blurted in shock.

"You know it!" Xueli was ecstatic, her pretty face contorting with zeal.

"How could you possess Demon God Golden Blood?" Yang Kai stared at Xueli in disbelief.

"And I could ask you the same!" Xueli stepped forward. An oppressive pressure like a collapsing mountain descended, forcing Yang Kai to crouch and nearly suffocate.

Yu Mo's expression flickered. "Demon God Golden Blood? The legendary blood of the Great Demon God? How could this boy have it? That golden glow—couldn't it just be the color of his Yang-attribute True Yuan? Is he one of our Demon Race?"

He stared at Yang Kai in disbelief, his expression subtly changing.

"He's human," Xueli said slowly. "As for where he got the Demon God Golden Blood, that's a question for him. The Demon God Golden Blood resembles the hue of his Yang-attribute True Yuan; at first I was fooled too. If I hadn't seen his final battle in the Death Arena, I couldn't have been certain."

"So that's why you suddenly decided not to kill him back then?" Yu Mo realized with a start.

When they were in Sand City, Xueli had not wished Yang Kai to live; but after watching his last fight in the Death Arena, her attitude had changed and she ordered Yu Mo to seize Yang Kai alive.

Yu Mo had been puzzled by her change in attitude until now.

"If the Lady carries Demon God Golden Blood, wouldn't that make her an heir of the Great Demon God?" Yu Mo's face lit up; he shouted excitedly and looked at Xueli with growing reverence.

The Great Demon God was an object of veneration throughout the Demon Race; though he had died countless years ago, his majesty and influence remained undiminished.

Generations of Demon Lords had sought to restore the glory of the Great Demon God, but none had succeeded.

Within the Demon Race circulated a legend that although the Great Demon God had fallen, his legacy still existed—unfortunately, no one had found it.

Now that Xueli herself bore Demon God Golden Blood, she could justly be called an inheritor of the Great Demon God.

That was why Yu Mo was so excited; in time, Xueli could very well become the Demon Lord—the highest of achievements.

Xueli shook her head slowly. "I cannot be called an inheritor of the Great Demon God. Years ago I accidentally obtained some Demon God Golden Blood; it is solely because of that blood that I achieved what I have today."

Then she gritted her teeth and added, "But this boy's Demon God Golden Blood appears even more abundant than mine. He clearly knows some secrets of the Great Demon God—perhaps even where the Great Demon's legacy is hidden."

Yu Mo's eyes brightened as he stared at Yang Kai burning with expectation.

If what Xueli said were true, finding the Great Demon God's legacy through this boy might allow the Demon Race to reclaim its former glory.

The thought sent Yu Mo's blood racing and stirred immeasurable excitement.

"Boy, at this point you should tell me clearly," Xueli said with a smile. "Don't try any tricks before me. Since I've found you today, I won't let you escape."

"What is it you want to know?" Yang Kai remained unruffled and asked calmly.

"Where did you get the Demon God Golden Blood?"

"What if I don't tell you?" Yang Kai sneered.

Xueli paused, then nodded lightly. "Then you'll suffer. Even if I maim you, I can still force the information out. Also know this: Demon God Golden Blood is wondrous—if you refuse to cooperate, I'll kill you and extract your blood to refine it; that'll get me the essence of your Demon God Golden Blood."

"I doubt you have that ability!" Yang Kai snorted. By now he understood: Xueli had come for his blood, and Zhang Ao and Cao Guan were after the Coffin-Bearer; both threads connected to him. Xueli had likely used Zhang Ao and the others to track him, but she couldn't have expected that the Coffin-Bearer the others sought would be the real key.

"How presumptuous." Yu Mo roared, his expression murderous. "You escaped last time—this time you won't get away!"

He surged with Demon Yuan and transformed into a black mist that rolled toward Yang Kai, the haze alive with vivid images of savage beasts and bloodthirsty visages.

Yang Kai's face changed. A Saint-Grade Upper-Level secret treasure—the Silver Leaf—appeared in his hand, and with a sweep, layers of silver waves rolled forward to briefly block the encroaching black mist.

In the next instant the silver waves surged like tides and tore through the dark indigo veil Xueli had created.
