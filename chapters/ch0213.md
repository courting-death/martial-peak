## Chapter 213 â€” Meng Wuya's Power

After Yang Kai left, Ling Taixu's expression gradually turned serious.

Although the violent aura emanating from Yang Kai posed no threat to him, Ling Taixu had to consider deeper implications.

After pondering for a long while, Ling Taixu sighed deeply, "Could this boy be attempting to validate his martial path through killing?"

That bloody and violent aura had already seeped into Yang Kai's very bones. If he wished to glimpse the true essence of martial arts in the future, there were only two methods: one was to extinguish this aura and cultivate a more peaceful technique.

However, Yang Kai was innately lacking; after much difficulty, he had achieved his current success. If he were to change his technique and become an ordinary talent again, how could he bear it?

It would be one thing to remain at the bottom forever, unable to see the heights above. But once a person had reached great heights and was suddenly cast back down to the bottom, that kind of blow was something no one could withstand.

If he couldn't change his technique, then he had no choice but to let that bloody and violent aura reach its peak, growing stronger alongside his power. Only then could he catch a glimpse of the mysteries of martial arts.

One was to break before establishing, while the other was to enter the path through killing. The path ahead was fraught with danger; a slight misstep could lead to shattering bones and obliterating souls. Throughout history, few who validated their martial path through killing ended well.

For those who validated their path through killing, enemies would always outnumber friends. There was a greater chance of losing oneself in slaughter, falling into madness.

Could a child like him endure it?

After leaving the sect leader, Yang Kai returned to his cave abode and took out the pills that Xia Ningshang had refined for him, swallowing them to enhance his strength.

The long-sealed incense burner was once again brought out, igniting exotic fragrances to suppress the operation speed of the True Yang Technique.

For over ten days, Yang Kai remained in seclusion within his cave. One reason was to consume the pills, and the other was to nurture the two secret treasures he had recently refined. The Shura Sword had played a significant role in his battle against Bai Yunfeng, and although he had not used the Thousand-Rays Blood Sea Begonia, it was undoubtedly a treasure of a first-rate sect overseas, and its power would not be lacking.

Every day at dawn, when the purple aura rose from the east, Yang Kai would practice the Proud Bone Golden Body Technique. Now that his strength had increased and his physical condition had improved, the progress of practicing the Proud Bone Golden Body Technique had also significantly accelerated, reaching nearly one-third of the way. However, the further he progressed, the more difficult it became. Each time he executed a move, his bones would crackle like beans popping.

The cave was quiet and serene, indeed a good place for seclusion. Xia Ningshang, this little junior sister, would occasionally come over, bringing delicious food to share with Yang Kai. During idle moments, the two would chat.

Sometimes, Xia Ningshang would take a short nap on the stone bed. At such times, no matter how Yang Kai called her, he could not wake her.

One day, while Yang Kai was in the midst of his cultivation, he suddenly heard the voice of the Sect Leader: "Can you kill?"

The sudden voice startled Yang Kai, and he reflexively jumped up from his spot. After realizing it was Ling Taixu's voice, he understood it was just a false alarm.

"Master!" Yang Kai looked around but did not see Ling Taixu's figure. Instead, he keenly sensed a divine sense lingering beside him.

Ling Taixu asked again.

Yang Kai finally replied, "Yes!"

"What kind of person should be killed?"

Yang Kai frowned, pondering for a moment before saying, "Those who plot against me, kill them; those who harm my friends and family, kill them; those who obstruct my cultivation, kill them; those who steal my treasures, kill them! If a person does not provoke me, I will not kill!"

It was unclear whether Ling Taixu heard him, as a long time passed after Yang Kai's answer without any further response.

Half a day later, Ling Taixu finally spoke, "Prepare yourself; in half a month, I will take you to a place!"

"Understood!" Yang Kai did not ask further, but he vaguely guessed that Ling Taixu seemed to have some plans, and they were likely difficult decisions. Otherwise, he wouldn't have remained silent for so long after Yang Kai's answer.

After thinking for a moment, Yang Kai chose not to delve deeper.

Ling Taixu was his master and possessed profound strength. If he truly meant harm, he would have acted long ago. With only half a month remaining, neither too long nor too short, Yang Kai devoted himself even more diligently to cultivation and pill consumption.

Time flew by, and half a month passed in the blink of an eye. During this time, Su Yan visited one night, and the two engaged in passionate exchanges, cultivating together after the rain.

Yang Kai had already clearly experienced the benefits of dual cultivation. His Yuan Qi was becoming increasingly pure; although he had not yet reached the True Essence Realm, he was not inferior to ordinary True Essence Realm martial artists. Otherwise, during his battle with Bai Yunfeng, his palm strike would not have been able to break through the Heavenly Net.

Both Yang Kai and Su Yan savored the experience, diligently engaging in dual cultivation. Although the encounters were few, the quality was astonishingly high.

After half a month, Yang Kai had consumed all the pills refined by Xia Ningshang. Moreover, while meditating and cultivating in the Dragon Confinement Ravine, he had also accumulated some Yang Liquid in his dantian, and his strength had broken through to the third layer of the Separation and Union Realm.

At night, Yang Kai was meditating at the entrance of his cave when he suddenly heard the sound of fluttering garments in the air. Two figures then darted into his cave, one after the other.

"Master!" Yang Kai stood up to pay his respects, glancing at the other person in confusion, "Shopkeeper Meng?"

"Hehehe!" Meng Wuya laughed rhythmically, his old face scrunching into a ball.

Yang Kai frowned, unsure of what Meng Wuya found amusing.

Suddenly, Meng Wuya's smile vanished, and he scrutinized Yang Kai with uncertainty. Then, his eyes sparkled as he slapped a hand on Yang Kai's shoulder and another on his dantian, shouting angrily, "Get out, old man!"

Ling Taixu looked at Meng Wuya in surprise, clearly not understanding why he suddenly attacked Yang Kai. However, since he did not sense any killing intent from Meng Wuya, he did not intervene.

Yang Kai grunted, unable to move. In front of an old monster like Meng Wuya, even the third layer of the Separation and Union Realm felt like a helpless infant.

A massive suction force came, and Yang Kai heard the cries and struggles of the Earth Demon.

During the day, Yang Kai had already summoned the Earth Demon back, but even though it was hiding within his body, it could not escape Meng Wuya's keen perception.

The secret that even the sect leader Ling Taixu could not uncover was completely exposed before Meng Wuya. The difference in strength was clear at a glance.

Meng Wuya's hand transformed into a claw, like a dragon drawing water, and he forcefully pulled out a stream of black gas, which was none other than the Earth Demon wrapped around the Soul-Breaking Spike.

Sensing Meng Wuya's killing intent, the Earth Demon screamed in terror, the black gas swirling chaotically, morphing into a hideous human face, yet it could not break free from Meng Wuya's grasp.

Ling Taixu's expression changed dramatically.

"Shopkeeper Meng, please show mercy!" Yang Kai hurriedly spoke, fearing that the old man would kill the Earth Demon on the spot.

Meng Wuya glanced at Yang Kai and said solemnly, "Do you know what this is?"

"The soul of a demon!" Yang Kai nodded.

"You know and still dare to let it enter your body! Are you not afraid of being devoured by it?" Meng Wuya was astonished. He initially thought Yang Kai was a naive youth who had fallen victim to the demon's soul's schemes, but it turned out he was more aware than anyone else.

"It cannot devour me," Yang Kai replied with a wry smile. "The Earth Demon has recognized me as its master; its life and death are in my hands."

"Recognized you as its master?" Meng Wuya was also shocked. Although he had pulled out the Earth Demon's soul, he could still feel its immense power. Now it was merely too weak to exert its full strength. If it were to recover, even the entire Lingxiao Pavilion would not withstand a single blow. "How did it recognize you as its master?" This was a serious matter, and Meng Wuya had to confirm cautiously.

Yang Kai quickly recounted the events that led to the recognition of the master.

After listening, Meng Wuya's expression shifted, and he nodded slightly, "Indeed, in this case, it is indeed under your control, so there is no need to worry about it harming you."

"Let me go! I have devoted my loyalty to the young master; this heart can be witnessed by heaven and earth, and the sun and moon can testify. What right do you have to keep me here? You little brat, if I were at my peak, you would not dare to be so presumptuous!" The Earth Demon, a ten-thousand-year-old monster, had been frightened half to death earlier, but now that it sensed no danger, it immediately regained its arrogance.

Meng Wuya looked at it with a sinister gaze and chuckled coldly, "If I were at my peak, would you dare to be so presumptuous?"

The words were identical to what the Earth Demon had just said, word for word, but upon closer inspection, the deeper meaning was vastly different.

The Earth Demon was stunned and then exclaimed, "You... it turns out you..."

Meng Wuya snorted coldly and released his grip. The Earth Demon, like a rat seeing a cat, hurriedly wrapped itself in a mass of black gas and rushed into Yang Kai's body, no longer daring to show itself.

Terrified, it realized that it had hidden so deeply, yet it could not escape this old fellow's scrutiny. This old man was far from as simple as he appeared.

Throughout the entire process, Ling Taixu had remained silent, but now he finally spoke, "Do not trust demons lightly; always be cautious."

"I will be careful," Yang Kai nodded.

"Are you ready?"

"Yes."

He had already informed Su Yan and Xia Ningshang a few days ago, so there was nothing else to prepare.

"Then let's go." Ling Taixu reached out a large hand, pulling Yang Kai over, and then soared out of the cave, with Meng Wuya closely following.

The wind howled as they descended toward the unfathomable depths of the Dragon Confinement Ravine. Yang Kai squinted down but could see nothing.

Could the place Master wanted to take him be deep within the Dragon Confinement Ravine? No, he had previously said that the dangers below were numerous, and even he did not dare to venture deep. It was impossible for him to take Yang Kai to such peril.

After falling several hundred zhang, Ling Taixu suddenly changed direction and flew sideways.

After flying for a while, they finally came to a stop.

In the darkness, Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya hovered in mid-air, staring at the stone wall ahead.

"Is it here?" Meng Wuya asked.

"Yes," Ling Taixu nodded. "We will act together and infuse our true essence inward."

"Alright!"

"This time, I will trouble you."

"What are we being polite for? You are being too formal." Meng Wuya's mouth split into a grin, revealing his back teeth.

As long as they could send this kid Yang Kai away, Meng Wuya would not mind expending a bit of true essence. So when Ling Taixu asked him to assist in sending Yang Kai to a certain place, the old man immediately agreed without hesitation.
