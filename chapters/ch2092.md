## Chapter 2092 — I Didn't Do Anything

"The formation is for sale — what will Your Excellency bid?" Qin Chaoyang asked angrily.

The man surnamed Fu seemed prepared; he raised a finger and said, "Ten million!"

"Why don't you go snatch it yourself?" Qin Chaoyang thundered.

The others stared at the man surnamed Fu with faces full of incredulity.

Ten million Source Crystals was a fair sum, but it was far too low for the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation. At the auction a single Dao Origin Fruit could fetch over ten million Source Crystals — let alone such an unparalleled formation.

If this formation were put up for sale, many great sects would surely fight for it; selling it for tens of millions of Source Crystals would be no problem. A mere ten million Source Crystals was simply unacceptable to Qin Chaoyang.

"Ten million, not a single coin more or less!" The man surnamed Fu ignored Qin Chaoyang's fury and snorted coldly. "If you dawdle, this price will be gone."

"Tsk tsk, the noble of Fei Sheng Palace is indeed domineering — it's quite the spectacle," Hua Qingsi suddenly laughed coquettishly.

"Fei Sheng Palace?" Zhuang Pan cried, and Du Lishen's expression also changed.

Duan Yuanshan was likewise stunned; partly because he had just learned the origin of the man surnamed Fu, and partly because of Hua Qingsi. Everyone had suspected the man surnamed Fu might have some backing, but no one knew his true background; only Hua Qingsi had seen through it somehow, though no one knew where she had gleaned the clue.

Upon hearing that, Yang Kai became very alert and cast the man surnamed Fu a discreet glance, inwardly sensing this fellow was not here with good intentions.

That day he had slain the Fei Sheng Palace Young Master Ning Yuancheng after Ning Yuancheng had been possessed by Mu Xiao; though it had been forced upon him, it nonetheless amounted to indirectly killing the man.

Afterwards he had taken possession of Ning Yuancheng's tower-ship and refined it for his own use.

That being so, the man's appearance in Fenglin City was not surprising. He was likely here to pursue the cause of Ning Yuancheng's death; a few days ago the man surnamed Fu had surely noticed that tower-ship outside the Spiritual Pill shop.

He probably already believed Yang Kai to be the murderer!

Thinking this, Yang Kai's expression darkened slightly.

Hua Qingsi had seen through his background. The man surnamed Fu's eyes narrowed slightly as he stared at the beauty and said coldly, "Madam, you have keen eyes. Where do you hail from?"

Hua Qingsi tucked a lock of hair behind her ear and smiled lightly. "I'm but a wandering warrior — what is there to say of my origins?"

"Hmph!"

The man surnamed Fu naturally did not buy Hua Qingsi's lie; though secretly suspicious, a faint trace of apprehension finally flashed across his eyes.

Anyone who could see through his background at a glance was not ordinary. But he was used to swaggering, so he still did not take Hua Qingsi very seriously.

"Have you made up your mind?" the man surnamed Fu turned to Qin Chaoyang again.

Qin Chaoyang sighed, "The price cannot go any higher?"

In the current situation they were at the mercy of others. He also had Qin Yu to consider and could not go against a stronger force, but if he could obtain more Source Crystals he would try.

"What do you think?" the man surnamed Fu replied with a question instead of an answer.

Qin Chaoyang's face dimmed; as if aged many years in an instant, he said, "Then let it be as you wish."

"Excellent!" The man surnamed Fu was greatly pleased; he beckoned Qin Chaoyang forward and said, "Hand it over to this Lord — I shall not go back on my word."

"Wait!"

At that moment, a sudden voice interrupted the transaction.

Everyone turned toward the sound and found Yang Kai speaking from the center. From Hua Qingsi and the man surnamed Fu's exchange to forcing Qin Chaoyang to sell the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation, Yang Kai had not said a word, and the others had almost forgotten him; none expected him to speak at this crucial moment, and they looked bewildered, uncertain of his intent.

Hua Qingsi's beautiful eyes shone with amusement as she appraised Yang Kai, a faint smile playing at her lips.

The man surnamed Fu's eyes narrowed; a hidden murderous glint flashed in his pupils as he hissed coldly, "Kid. What are you trying to do?"

"Sir, don't be so tense," Yang Kai chuckled. "I'm not here to snatch your business. But after your little stunt just now, it occurred to me our alliance is a bit too brittle—if anyone of us decided to back out, he could hold the others to ransom. That's hardly desirable."

Duan Yuanshan said in a deep voice, "It was my oversight."

He had originally thought that two Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm experts suddenly volunteering to join the team would be a boon—who could have imagined things would come to this? Fortunately, aside from the man surnamed Fu, Hua Qingsi still seemed relatively trustworthy for now. If Hua Qingsi turned out to be like the man surnamed Fu, they might as well beat a hasty retreat home before they were all demonized and lost their minds.

"This is not Lord Duan's fault. Dao Origin Realm experts in Fenglin City are not many; having outside reinforcements is something to be welcomed," Yang Kai said coolly.

Duan Yuanshan heaved a long sigh full of helplessness.

"To prevent this from happening again, I think we should discuss some rules — for example, no one may act like that again," Yang Kai said as he looked around.

"Yes, yes — we should discuss it," Du Lishen hurriedly agreed.

The others were unconcerned; they knew each other and had families and enterprises in Fenglin City, and would not act with such baseness as the man surnamed Fu. But they were unfamiliar with Hua Qingsi — if she were to act similarly, the team would definitely fall apart and might not even return safely, let alone repair the seal.

Moreover, the man surnamed Fu was so despicable that if he obtained the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation and then reneged, what could they do?

Such worries surged up; the several men furrowed their brows, deeply anxious.

"What, you do not trust this Lord?" The man surnamed Fu's face darkened at that.

Hua Qingsi pursed her lips and smiled, "Do you truly consider yourself a trustworthy man?"

The man surnamed Fu snorted coldly, "Madam, what are your intentions?"

He did not believe that a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert like Hua Qingsi acted out of pure goodwill to help repair the seal; if she helped, she must have her reasons.

"I bear no ill intent," Hua Qingsi said with a coquettish laugh. "It's simply that in these circumstances I cannot remain aloof."

Stung by Hua Qingsi’s open reproach, the man surnamed Fu flushed with anger, but with no excuse to act, he could only grit his teeth and force the fury back down.

"Quiet, everyone. This Duan finds Brother Yang's words reasonable. Very well—let it be agreed: until the seal is repaired and we have safely returned to the city, no one shall make demands like just now, nor leave their post without permission," Duan Yuanshan said in a deep voice.

"Rest assured — as long as this Lord can obtain the complete formation, I will of course assist you in repairing the seal," the man surnamed Fu said coldly.

"Words are easy to say..." Zhuang Pan muttered weakly.

"What do you expect? That this Lord will swear a Heart-Demon Oath?" The man surnamed Fu's gaze suddenly sharpened as he looked at Zhuang Pan.

Zhuang Pan turned pale with fright and hastily laughed sheepishly, "Sir, you jest."

"Why not?" Yang Kai gave a slight smile. "If you truly are willing to stand together with us, swearing a Heart-Demon Oath is no problem — unless you... have a guilty conscience."

"How dare you!" The man surnamed Fu roared, eyes blazing as if to burn Yang Kai alive.

Yang Kai remained unmoved and simply met his gaze.

In any case, the man likely already believed Yang Kai to be the killer of Ning Yuancheng, so enmity between them was inevitable; Yang Kai did not fear his grudge.

Unexpectedly, Hua Qingsi also agreed wholeheartedly, "This is a rare whim of mine to act with outsiders; I will not let certain people ruin my mood. If everyone agrees, let us swear a Heart-Demon Oath."

"Who would agree to that?" the man surnamed Fu blurted.

"Everyone's agreed—seems only you hold a different view, Sir," Yang Kai said with a smile, then suddenly put on a look of mock astonishment. "Do you truly mean to take the formation method and make off with it? You can't be so faithless, Sir—what a treacherous heart!"

"You're talking nonsense! This Lord never said such a thing," the man surnamed Fu thundered, furious.

"Then consider yourself agreed," Yang Kai said, not bothering to answer him, and swept his gaze around. "If no one objects, then let's begin."

With that, he solemnly swore his Heart-Demon Oath.

The others glanced at each other and followed suit in imitation.

Even Hua Qingsi earnestly swore in public.

Then… everyone looked toward the man surnamed Fu.

Fu's eyes blazed with fury; he glared at Yang Kai as if he would split him in two and ground his teeth, "Very well! This Lord will remember you."

Yang Kai chuckled, "Thank you for remembering me, Sir — I'm truly flattered."

"You're courting death!" the man surnamed Fu snarled.

"What are you threatening me for?" Yang Kai looked innocent. "I didn't do anything."

"Sir, it's your turn now," Hua Qingsi interjected with a smile. "Unless you no longer want that complete formation method, you must swear a Heart-Demon Oath. If not, I will be grateful and increase my offer."

"You are all very impressive!" the man surnamed Fu forced out, tamping down the fury in his heart; before everyone's eyes he could only grit his teeth and solemnly pronounce the Heart‑Demon Oath.

The Heart-Demon Oath was mostly verbal, but it was not entirely without effect; no warrior dared flout it lightly, for if an oath backfired at a crucial moment, it could be most troublesome.

That said, there were many secret techniques to evade such oaths, so they could not always be taken at face value.

All of those secret techniques demand exceptionally high cultivation and lengthy preparation; given the man surnamed Fu's strength, he ought not to be able to circumvent the oath in the short term.
