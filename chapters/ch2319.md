## Chapter 2319 — As Pure as Jade

Hearing Yang Kai’s question, a trace of gloom flashed across Chai Hu’s face, and Ghost Ancestor and the others all looked ashamed.

"Eh…" Yang Kai suddenly let out a surprised murmur, as if he had discovered something. He reached for Chai Hu's wrist and said, "Pardon me!"

As he spoke, he placed his hand on Chai Hu’s wrist and released his Origin Qi to investigate.

After a moment, he looked up at Chai Hu and said, “Senior, has your cultivation fallen?”

He had sensed the presence of Origin Qi within Chai Hu’s body! This was simply impossible—given Chai Hu’s Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation, his power should still be at the Saint Yuan stage. Only after advancing to the Dao Origin Realm would it begin to transform into Origin Qi.

But the truth was otherwise. There were indeed traces of Origin Qi in Chai Hu’s body. There was only one explanation for this: Chai Hu had once been in the Dao Origin Realm, and some of his power had already transformed into Origin Qi, but for some unknown reason, his cultivation had fallen.

Chai Hu gave a bitter smile and said, “Young Brother, you’re not wrong.”

Ghost Ancestor also let out a heavy sigh. “Half a year ago, when we went out to temper ourselves, we encountered a group of Eleventh-Tier Demonic Beasts. We were outnumbered and had to flee. Fourth Brother stayed behind to buy us time and was gravely injured. His Dantian was damaged, and after recuperating for a while, he ended up like this. He also lost an eye in that battle.”

Chi Yue looked full of self-reproach and said, “If we had all stayed back then, maybe this wouldn’t have happened.”

Gu Cangyun and Ai Ou didn’t say much, but their faces were full of guilt. Clearly, they couldn’t let go of what happened and felt greatly responsible for Chai Hu’s misfortune.

For a cultivator, a fall in cultivation is no small matter. Once it happens, it may never be possible to rise again. For those who pursue higher realms, it is nothing short of a death sentence—an agony even worse than death.

Seeing their dejected expressions, Chai Hu said, “Why are you all looking like I’m about to die? It’s just a temporary setback. It’s not like I can’t cultivate back up.”

Though he acted open-minded, everyone present knew how slim the hope of regaining one’s cultivation truly was.

For a moment, the atmosphere in the room became extremely heavy.

Yang Kai suddenly spoke, "Senior, in the past half year, hasn’t your Dantian ached whenever you used your strength?"

Chai Hu was taken aback, not knowing why Yang Kai asked, but he answered honestly, “Occasionally, yes. After all, my Dantian was indeed injured in that battle half a year ago. There should be some lingering effects.”

Yang Kai nodded and said, “And when you circulate your strength, do you feel any blockage?”

“That’s right. Sometimes my meridians ache and my power doesn’t flow smoothly.” Chai Hu said with some admiration. Although Yang Kai was only one Stage higher, he had figured out Chai Hu’s condition with just a brief probe, showing how powerful his Divine Sense was.

Chi Yue’s expression changed, and she looked at Yang Kai with some hope. “Did you discover something?”

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, withdrew his hand, and said, “Senior, your situation may not be due to your Dantian’s injury.”

“Then what is it?” Chai Hu’s eyes widened, and the others also looked at Yang Kai curiously, wanting to know what he meant.

“Senior, could you lift your clothes and let me see your lower abdomen?” Yang Kai asked instead of answering.

Chai Hu nodded and was about to lift his clothes, but suddenly realized something. He looked at Chi Yue and said, “Fifth Sister, turn around.”

Chi Yue curled her lip disdainfully and said, “What’s the big deal? Why so shy?”

Chai Hu broke out in a cold sweat. “Men and women should not touch each other so casually.”

Chi Yue’s pretty face turned stern as she snorted, “Are you going to do it or not? If not, I’ll do it for you.”

“Alright, alright, I’ll do it myself!” Chai Hu was truly afraid of her fiery temper. Knowing that if he hesitated any longer, she really would take action, he stopped hesitating and lifted his clothes.

Instantly, several pairs of eyes turned to look at his abdomen.

“Eh, what’s this?” Chi Yue suddenly exclaimed, her beautiful eyes fixed on Chai Hu’s Dantian.

“What?” Chai Hu was also stunned. He looked down and the next moment, his eyes widened in shock. “What the hell is this?”

On his abdomen, several dark red lines had appeared, crisscrossing as if hiding some mystery. These lines were clearly not natural, but had appeared for some unknown reason.

“Fifth Brother, you didn’t know about these?” Ghost Ancestor looked at Chai Hu in surprise.

Chai Hu shook his head, looking completely at a loss.

Chi Yue looked at him with disgust and said, “How long has it been since you bathed? You don’t even know what’s on your own body. No wonder you smell.”

Chai Hu gave an embarrassed laugh. “I’ll wash soon, I’ll wash soon!”

Yang Kai, deep in thought at the side, said, “So it’s like this.”

Hearing this, Ai Ou immediately looked at him, excited. “Yang boy, do you know something? Hurry and tell us.”

The others also looked at Yang Kai eagerly.

Yang Kai said, “Senior’s cultivation falling shouldn’t be due to his Dantian’s injury.”

“Then what’s the reason?” several people asked in unison.

“He’s been poisoned!” Yang Kai answered.

Chai Hu was stunned. “Poisoned? How could I be poisoned?”

He looked completely unaware, clearly not believing Yang Kai. Thinking back, he hadn’t come into contact with any poison recently, nor did he feel poisoned.

Yang Kai said, “The Demonic Beasts you encountered that time—were they Heavenly Profound Wolf Spiders?”

Everyone’s eyes widened in shock. “How did you know?”

Yang Kai looked at Chai Hu. “Senior, did you drink the blood of a Heavenly Profound Wolf Spider?”

Chai Hu said, “I bit one to death.”

The others twitched at the corners of their mouths, looking at Chai Hu in disbelief.

Chai Hu said, “There were too many of those damned things. I had no choice but to bite one to death.”

“That explains it. The blood of the Heavenly Profound Wolf Spider is poisonous. You mustn’t ingest it!”

Gu Cangyun’s expression changed. “Sect Master Yang, are you saying that Fourth Brother’s cultivation fell because he drank the blood of the Heavenly Profound Wolf Spider?”

“Yes. The blood of the Heavenly Profound Wolf Spider can suppress cultivation and is used in alchemy. Combined with certain herbs, it can be refined into the Profound Wolf Pill. A single Spiritual Pill is enough to cripple a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, destroying their foundation and making it impossible to cultivate ever again.”

At these words, everyone’s faces changed dramatically, turning pale.

If what Yang Kai said was true, then Chai Hu’s future…

No one dared to think further. They had thought Chai Hu had only fallen to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and might recover with effort, but now it seemed far more serious. If this was true, not only would he never regain his cultivation, but as time passed, it would only decline further until he became a cripple.

Seeing their ugly expressions, Yang Kai smiled and said, “That’s just the effect of the Profound Wolf Pill. The blood alone isn’t that potent.”

Ai Ou asked anxiously, “Is there a way to save him?”

Yang Kai turned to look at Chi Yue.

“Why are you looking at me?” Chi Yue looked confused.

Yang Kai said, “Senior Chi Yue’s blood should have some effect in suppressing the poison.”

“Huh?” The others were even more confused, not knowing why.

But Chi Yue’s eyes lit up. “I understand.”

She was a Yao King on Yao Star Di Chen, a descendant of the Ancient Divine Spirit, the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, and her bloodline still carried traces of the Divine Spirit. The Heavenly Profound Wolf Spider and the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider were of the same species, but the latter was far superior.

The aura of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider was enough to suppress the lower-ranked Heavenly Profound Wolf Spider.

As she spoke, Chi Yue didn’t hesitate. She sliced her wrist with her fingers like a blade, and in an instant, bright red blood flowed from her fair wrist.

She held her wrist out to Chai Hu and said, “Fourth Brother, drink it.”

Chai Hu stared in shock, his face flushing. “What are you doing?”

Chi Yue laughed lightly. “Still shy? Stop dawdling and drink!”

Without waiting for his reply, she shoved her wrist into Chai Hu’s mouth.

Yang Kai said, “If you want to recover your cultivation, Senior, you’d best not refuse.”

Hearing this, Chai Hu hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and began to suck.

Yang Kai said, “Although Senior Chi Yue’s blood can suppress the poison a bit, to fully remove it, you’ll need a special pill. I’ll refine it. Until it’s ready, don’t use any strength, or things may get worse.”

As Yang Kai spoke, Chai Hu released Chi Yue’s hand, wiped the blood from his mouth, and said, “Alright, I’ll trouble you, Young Brother.”

Yang Kai grinned and said, “Since you and the Elders of my Sect have sworn brotherhood with my father- and mother-in-law, we’re all family now. There’s no need to stand on ceremony.”

“Father- and mother-in-law?” Chai Hu looked odd, turning to Chi Yue. “Fifth Sister, you’ve been married?”

Chi Yue spat at him. “Don’t talk nonsense and ruin my reputation.”

Ai Ou snorted coldly from the side. “I am this brat’s father-in-law! He’s ugly as a gourd, yet somehow he’s made so many women fall for him! Even my precious daughter wasn’t spared. It’s heartbreaking!”

Yang Kai tossed his hair and said proudly, “Born naturally handsome!”

Chi Yue snorted, “Now that you’re in the Star Realm, far from home, you must have fooled around plenty, right? Tell your mother-in-law, how many innocent girls have you seduced in the past two years?”

Yang Kai looked embarrassed and protested, “Nothing of the sort! Ever since I came to the Star Realm, I’ve kept myself pure, as pure as jade!”

Chi Yue shot him a cold look. “You’d better. If I ever catch you flirting with another woman, I’ll cut her into a thousand pieces, then chop you into mincemeat.”

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead. “That will never happen.”
