## Chapter 1871 — Tooth for a Tooth

Li Maoming had been goofing around ever since he appeared, never taking anything seriously, but the moment he heard Zi Wuji's words his expression turned utterly grave and his gaze went ice-cold.

Zi Wuji shuddered involuntarily; he did not doubt the truth of the other's words for a moment, and knew that if he remained so loose-tongued the other might truly break his hands and feet.

From the other's reaction he also learned the position his mother held in that man's heart — a sanctity not to be violated — and his heart leaped for joy.

After a moment of hesitation Zi Wuji said, "Wuji didn't make himself clear; Venerable Li, please calm your anger — it's like this…"

Zi Wuji did not speak the following words aloud; instead he stared at Li Maoming and his lips moved slightly as he secretly transmitted the words.

Li Maoming's usually inscrutable face changed in an instant and he cried out, "What did you say? Zi Long he…"

"It is absolutely true." Zi Wuji nodded solemnly. "My mother has been unable to eat or sleep these days from her worry. Since Venerable One was once friends with my father and mother, might you find a chance to go and dissuade her? Wuji fears she will grieve herself to death; if some mishap were to occur…"

Li Maoming's majestic frame staggered slightly. An expression of disbelief appeared on his face; his eyes grew complex as if recalling something, his features falling into sorrow, and he remained silent for a long time. After a while Li Maoming gave a dry, bitter laugh and murmured, "Zi Long, you bastard, how could you… how could you…"

The rest of the words could not be said; his voice choked.

"Venerable Li, you might consider what Wuji just said. Wuji is truly worried about my mother's condition," Zi Wuji said softly.

Li Maoming drew a breath and steadied his emotions, then glanced at Zi Wuji. In a cold voice he said, "I will see her, but this matter has nothing to do with today's affairs. I will not treat it as a bargaining chip. If you truly have filial piety, then be filial to your mother and stop treating her like leverage! If I discover anything like this again, I will not spare you."

Zi Wuji's face shifted; anger rose within him, but outwardly he had to bow and agree, "Venerable Li's admonition is right; it was Wuji's fault."

Fool! No wonder you lost to Father back then. Becoming a loser, you deserve to live alone until you die! Zi Wuji cursed in his heart.

While the two spoke, Yang Kai and Gongsun Liang had traded hundreds of moves; energies lashed through the sky and no one dared approach within a hundred zhang of their duel. Hundreds of moves later they still showed no sign of a victor. Yang Kai spoke solemnly, "This Lord is the Purple Star's Venerable One. To strike to defend the Purple Star's peace is only right — what reward would I demand?"

Gongsun Liang's eyes were filled with fury; though he knew Yang Kai was spouting nonsense, he was helpless.

His face grew grim as he barked, "If that's the case, don't blame this old man for being ruthless."

As he spoke he formed hand seals and his Saint Yuan surged within him.

Yang Kai frowned, mistaking that the old fellow would unleash some profound secret art, and did not dare be careless; he stepped back hurriedly. Though his strength made him look down on Gongsun Liang, the other was after all a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert — if he truly fought to the death, Yang Kai had to be wary.

Then Gongsun Liang revealed a cruel smile; his figure flickered and he split into two, two into four, four into eight…

In the blink of an eye the sky was filled with Gongsun Liang's forms, each as vivid as life.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened as he watched.

This was undoubtedly a powerful secret art, effective for both attacking foes and making an escape.

Under the scrutiny of his Divine Sense Yang Kai could not, for the moment, discern which Gongsun Liang was real and which were phantoms; every one was identical.

At the appearance of this technique Yang Kai's face turned serious, and Li Maoming, who had been watching from afar, also tensed; a faint purple gleam flashed in his eyes as he swept through the countless apparitions, trying to find the true body.

Gongsun Liang laughed and cried out, "Second Young Master, you forced my hand! I hope you can bear the consequences!"

As soon as the words fell, all of those phantoms stopped paying any heed to Yang Kai and shot straight toward the battlefield.

"Ah…" a wail rang out. A martial artist who had been grappling with one of the Great Elder's allies was suddenly flung backward; a palm print bloomed on his chest, clear as day, caving his breast inward.

Suspended in mid-air, the man spewed blood in torrents, fragments of shattered organs mixed within. He was already dead before his body even hit the ground.

One horrible cry after another followed. Each victim belonged to Zi Wuji's side and all were Origin Returning Realm experts.

All across the battlefield, Gongsun Liang’s figure appeared in countless places at once. The illusions were so lifelike it was impossible to tell real from false, and each one seemed genuine. Every time they struck, they felled one of Zi Wuji’s men in an instant.

In an instant everyone felt endangered; any fighter who was approached by Gongsun Liang showed panic and tried to flee.

But in the face of Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, how could they possibly escape?

In the blink of an eye more fell to murderous blows — each one a pillar of Zi Wuji's forces.

Zi Wuji's forehead veins bulged, his fists clenched, and he turned to look toward Yang Kai, roaring, "Venerable Yang, stop him at once!"

Yang Kai stroked his chin and hovered in midair, shaking his head. "Second Young Master, that is asking too much. I see no flaw in the Great Elder's move; how can I stop it?"

His words were nothing but a hollow pretense; having been forced into the fight he had no intention of exerting himself. If the Purple Star's people killed each other to the last, it would not be his concern.

He was simply trying to buy time.

Once the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao rescued Shen Tu and the others, he could leave at once.

Yet after standing and watching for a while he had already detected some clues and understood some subtleties of Gongsun Liang's technique; if he used the World-Ending Demon Eye to pierce illusion, finding the true body would not be difficult.

Hearing Yang Kai's irresponsible reply, Zi Wuji felt a sting in his chest and nearly spat blood.

If all his people were truly slaughtered, then there would be nothing left for him to fight for—what was the point of competing when his men were gone? His expression twisted with rage for a moment before Zi Wuji roared,
“Since that’s how it is—then I beg Venerable Yang to answer tooth for tooth, blood for blood!”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and showed a feral grin. "That is easy enough."

With that he snapped his fingers and sent dozens of Golden Blood Threads flying out, which became scores of blades that shot like arrows in every direction.

Sss sss sss…

The sound of air being cut never ceased, and soon a few screams echoed out.

Seven or eight Origin Returning Realm fighters were caught unawares by the Golden Blood Threads; their protective Saint Yuan and Secret Treasures were instantly ruptured, and the threads pierced their vital points, carrying off their lives.

With Yang Kai's current cultivation and the suddenness of his attack, those Origin Returning Realm fighters embroiled in fierce combat could not withstand him.

The Golden Blood Threads wove back and forth again, carrying off another batch of lives.

Within only a dozen breaths Yang Kai had slain about as many as Gongsun Liang had.

Gongsun Liang howled in fury; Origin Returning Realm fighters were indispensable pillars for any force. After all, ascending to the Void King Realm was not easy; a faction's strength depended not only on the number of Void King Realm experts but also on the number of Origin Returning Realm cultivators.

After today’s battle, regardless of who wins or loses, Purple Star will inevitably suffer grievous losses.

This was a result that neither Gongsun Liang nor Zi Wuji wished to see, but it was unavoidable.

The end of one era and the coming of another always demanded the price of blood and lives.

In the sky all Origin Returning Realm fighters and even First Stage of the Void King Realm cultivators were chilled; the scene was like Yang Kai and Gongsun Liang holding a killing contest — who could kill the fastest, who could kill the most. Whoever could not bear it would be the first to yield…

Before these two Second Stage Void King Realm experts, no one could withstand their overwhelming might.

Li Maoming, who had stood by Zi Wuji as if unconcerned with the world, also grew grave; he realized that if he did not intervene the Purple Star might truly be finished.

He had never imagined events would develop to this point.

He wished to stop them, but constrained by his earlier words, he could not move without undermining his own position.

At that headache-inducing moment a low snarl came from Gongsun Liang's side: "Li Maoming, if you remember the favors of old, then come and strike with this old man — wipe out this brat first! You do not want the Purple Star to suffer grievous losses, do you?"

Li Maoming frowned and hesitated, "I do not wish to see brothers slaughter one another, but the safety of the Second Young Master…"

I will not make things difficult for you. I won’t demand the Second Young Master’s head. Even if I take control of Purple Star, I will ensure he lives out his days in wealth, honor, and peace, without a single worry.

Li Maoming’s expression wavered.

Zi Wuji stared at Li Maoming in astonishment. "Venerable Li, you wouldn't…"

"Events have reached the point where I cannot refuse to act," Li Maoming sighed. "Rest assured, with me here no one in this world will harm you two; I will defend you with my life."

With that he moved and vanished from where he stood.

Zi Wuji stood frozen for a time, then lost his temper and began to hurl filthy abuse, calling Gongsun Liang treacherous and despicable and denouncing Li Maoming as faithless, his words filthy and unrestrained, no longer showing the graceful bearing he once had.

He was furious.

Li Maoming was bound by the favor he owed Gongsun Liang from years past, and had agreed to join hands with him against Yang Kai. If he did so now, then after today’s battle Zi Wuji would be utterly defeated. Though Li Maoming had promised to keep him safe, and Gongsun Liang had sworn to grant him a life of wealth and ease, that throne towering above the hundreds of millions on Purple Star would no longer be something he could even dream of reaching.

Unless Yang Kai could take on two at once and defeat them both!

But was that possible? All three were Second Stage of the Void King Realm experts and their strengths were roughly equal; one person could not possibly beat two.

Despair filled Zi Wuji's eyes.
