## Chapter 1999 — Soul-Severing Blade

The short one hundred zhang road leading to the Dragon Ascension Altar had become the graveyard for countless Void King Realm warriors.

Half an hour later, those dozencls of first‑tier warriors were less than ten zhang from the Dragon Ascension Altar.

From such a close distance the dozen or so treasures arrayed on the altar could be seen clearly, and for a moment everyone, regardless of background or origin, found their breathing quicken.

But there were only a dozen or so treasures, whereas no fewer than forty warriors had reached the vicinity first; no matter how one counted, they could not be fairly divided — this ensured that the majority of them were destined to return empty‑handed.

The crowd had clearly noticed this, so once they drew within ten zhang of the Dragon Ascension Altar everyone silently steeled their strength, and amid shifting gazes an inexplicable hostility began to fester wildly.

Suddenly, a tearing sound split the air; Heaven‑and‑Earth Energy swirled in disorder, and a golden arrow shot forth at tremendous speed toward a burly man.

“Damn you — always knew you’d try to ambush me; finally couldn’t hold back, could you?” the burly man snapped, as if he had expected this. Seeing the attacker strike, he immediately thrust his hand out; in the next instant a six‑sided, teal shield materialized before him, covering the greater part of his body.

Clang...

A thunderous sound rang out; though the golden arrow had considerable power, it was nevertheless halted by the burly man who had already prepared his defense.

The would‑be ambusher froze at the sight.

The burly man merely sneered, then in a flash withdrew the shield and clenched both fists. Origin Qi surged along his knuckles as he struck at his foe with a shout: “Overlord Saint Fist!”

This was clearly a secret art of tremendous force; the moment the punch flew, a faint profound intent spread within it, showing he had already brushed the threshold of the Dao Origin Realm — perhaps he was but one step away from ascending to that Realm.

The fist wind carried an aura of supreme arrogance, as if to command the world. The ambusher’s face changed; he twisted aside and snatched at the air, suddenly producing in his palm a three‑chi long azure peak sword.

He flicked the blade with his finger, channeling Origin Qi into the sword. His expression turned solemn.

“Water‑Moon Mirror Flower!” he murmured. The sword traced half a circle in midair, and the void abruptly manifested a mirror of swordlight, bright enough to reflect one’s face.

The Overlord Saint Fist arrived as expected, but was wholly stopped by that mirror of swordlight.

The Domains of the two Void King Realm masters erupted simultaneously, pressing fiercely against each other.

Crack...

The collision was so violent that even space itself seemed unable to withstand it; in that instant a slender fissure appeared.

“Good, good, finally met a decent opponent — delightful, delightful!” the burly man roared with laughter, utterly unshaken and arrogant.

His opponent, by contrast, cursed inwardly; he had only intended to casually eliminate a competitor with a sneak attack, but had met a lunatic instead.

With no other choice, he braced himself and fought.

No sooner had the duel erupted than roughly half of the forty‑plus first‑tier warriors, as if by prior agreement, leapt into action.

But they did not press toward the Dragon Ascension Altar; instead they leapt at the nearest warriors, cutting them down.

In an instant chaos reigned around the Dragon Ascension Altar.

Ambushes and counter‑ambushes followed one after another.

Often a warrior would only just start to strike at his target before being ambushed himself, forced to grit his teeth and parry two attackers at once.

There were lone duels, melees, and teams ganging up to finish foes...

These elite Void King Realm experts of Fenglin City suddenly turned on one another as if they were sworn enemies; before long their eyes shone red with bloodlust and the radiance of Martial Skills and Secret Treasures burst forth together, blindingly brilliant.

The lagging second‑tier and third‑tier warriors stared in amazement...

But soon their amazement turned to delight, for this might mean they still had a chance at the treasures on the Dragon Ascension Altar. One by one they fell silent and pushed forward with all their might.

They had thought it too simply; though the first‑tier warriors were slaughtering each other, the moment a later‑arriver approached these men would, without exception, stop attacking their opponents and instead cooperate to instantly kill the newcomer.

In their eyes only the original first‑tier warriors were true competitors; the later arrivals were nothing but clowns unworthy of touching the treasures.

After killing twenty or thirty of the later arrivals, the second‑tier warriors at last saw the picture clearly and dared not approach recklessly.

Yang Kai stood among the second‑tier ranks, and the scene drew a frown to his brow.

If he tried to approach the Dragon Ascension Altar now he would inevitably be attacked jointly by the first‑tier warriors and become the target of every blade; if he did not approach, he could not obtain any of the altar’s treasures.

With that thought he could not help speaking coldly, calling out: “The treasures belong to those fated to possess them. You lot are being too tyrannical and treat people far too cheaply. Friends, if you wish to leap the dragon gate, come up with me.”

Saying so, he led by example and charged forward first.

The second‑tier warriors had never been content to be held back; at Yang Kai’s cry of leaping the dragon gate and recalling what Qin Yu had said earlier, indignation filled them and they responded en masse, forming groups of three to five and advancing with murderous intent.

“Sharp tongue, you brat — I’ll kill you first!” Two experts directly ahead of Yang Kai fixated on him.

These two had been locked in fierce combat with one another, trading blows, but upon hearing Yang Kai’s words they both turned and targeted him.

As first‑tier men they were clearly elite Void King Realm masters; together, even if they could not stand against a Dao Origin Realm, they were more than a match for same‑rank Void King Realm opponents.

One of them summoned a great axe and swung it down at Yang Kai; the axe gleamed and its massive imprint fell like a meteor, unstoppable.

The other smacked a small bell in his hand; with each strike his face grew sterner and the bell’s sound coalesced into an invisible shock that surged toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression hardened; he dared not be careless, and poured his strength into motion. His hand turned and he wielded a great blade.

He guided the blade with Divine Sense and slashed remotely at one of them.

Light flashed across the great blade; a silent attack shot straight at the man’s Sea of Consciousness, immediately tearing through that man’s Divine Sense defenses and slicing into his Sea of Consciousness.

Within the man’s Sea of Consciousness a tempest rose in an instant, as if some vast force had cleaved it in two and whipped up towering waves; those waves did not fall but strangely evaporated midair.

The Sea of Consciousness was the source of a warrior’s soul; with its waters evaporated, the spirit would surely be harmed.

The man was struck as if by lightning, his body suddenly going rigid; his eyes trembled with terror as he stared at Yang Kai, panting and unable to speak a single word.

A moment later his neck twisted and he collapsed dead to the ground.

“What?” the other cried in horror, staring at his fallen comrade in disbelief.

He knew how troublesome the fallen opponent had been — their earlier clash had been evenly matched — yet now the man had been killed in a single stroke by a fellow Void King Realm warrior.

Void King Realm men absolutely did not possess such power, so the reason lay in that great blade.

What level of Secret Treasure was that?

While he hesitated, Yang Kai’s figure flickered; he had avoided the combined attack and, sneering, drew near the other man as he raised the great blade again.

Only then did the man notice something strange about the blade: the edge seemed to bleed black light, as if some nameless force twisted at his spirit.

It felt as though a single glance would slice his soul in two and cause it to hurt; horrified, he quickly looked away.

Soul‑Severing Blade!

An Imperial Treasure belonging to the Insect Emperor!

When Yang Kai slew the Insect Emperor he had taken two Imperial Treasures from him: the Slave‑Insect Bracelet and the Soul‑Severing Blade.

But both Imperial Treasures were far too powerful; Yang Kai’s strength at the time was insufficient to fully temper them, so he had set them aside. In later trials the Slave‑Insect Bracelet had proven useful — repelling the Illusory Void Butterfly in the Lost Realm, and intimidating the Yao Worm Matriarch beneath the Biyu Sect’s Ice Cliff, allowing Yang Kai to subdue her.

Having had those experiences, Yang Kai recognized the importance of Imperial Treasures and in his spare time had begun attempting to temper the Soul‑Severing Blade.

Although he had spent considerable time and effort, he still could not fully temper the Soul‑Severing Blade; even in use it displayed only a fraction of its true power, much like the Extinction Thunder Bead, whose full might Yang Kai could never completely unleash.

Still... an Imperial Treasure was an Imperial Treasure.

Even at half strength it was not something a Void King Realm opponent could stand against.

The Soul‑Severing Blade’s power was peculiar: wielded by Divine Sense it severed the soul without harming flesh, making it extremely hard to guard against.

In a sense the Soul‑Severing Blade could be counted as a Divine Soul Secret Treasure — rarer even than defensive Secret Treasures.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was also overwhelmingly strong; when he used the Soul‑Severing Blade against an equal‑rank Void King‑Grade foe, how could they possibly withstand it?

A single encounter, and the enemy’s soul would be shattered, dying on the spot.

Yang Kai wielded it deliberately: it seemed the first‑tier warriors held an unspoken consensus to bar second‑tier men from approaching the Dragon Ascension Altar, so to cow them he would first slaughter a few with lightning‑fast measures.

Killing a few as a warning would ensure no one dared to stop him again.

Sure enough, after that man’s death the remaining opponent instinctively backed away when Yang Kai raised the Soul‑Severing Blade again and the black light flowed along the blade.

That backward step immediately triggered the Dragon Ascension Altar’s warding.
