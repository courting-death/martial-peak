## Chapter 1467 — Goodbye Enchantress

The place where Qian Tong had been trapped that day was not far from where he now stood; Yang Kai followed his memory and walked on, leaving that garden-like spot, passing through a corridor about one hundred zhang long, and at last reached the interior of a palace.

This was exactly the spot where Qian Tong had once been trapped, and the stone stele still stood there.

Yang Kai had assumed a place so secluded would see no visitors, but when he stepped into the palace he realized he had been mistaken.

Not only had someone come in, there was more than one.

Not far off, seven or eight people stood together, all gazing the same way; each emitted a powerful aura—men and women, old and young—and among them one young man was particularly striking.

The youth's face was like crowned jade, his lips red and teeth white; the exposed skin so fair it could make women envious. At that moment he held a folding fan, posing with an elegant air as if he were the scion of some great power—a Young Master taking his servants and lackeys on a spring outing, utterly at ease.

All present paled beside him, and Yang Kai's eyes inevitably fell upon him.

At the sight, Yang Kai couldn't help shrinking his neck, wishing he had never set foot in this place.

That young-master-like figure, to his horror, turned out to be Xue Yue, the one he had avoided as if she were snake and scorpion.

How could she be here? Yang Kai swore inwardly. Although his journey had its twists, overall it had gone smoothly—he had not expected to collide with Xue Yue in a place like this!

Ill fortune! After entering the Imperial Garden he had thought he had shaken her off—how could fate be so cruel as to make their paths cross in such close quarters?

Had he known Xue Yue was here, Yang Kai would have avoided entering at all; but the Imperial Garden restricted the extension of Divine Sense, so he could not probe in advance.

What puzzled him further was how Xue Yue had made her way to this inner place.

The moment he saw the woman, Yang Kai gave Biluo a yank, intending to pull her away at once.

But Biluo did not budge; she stared fixedly toward one direction, her face a mixture of joy and grievance, then cried out, "Lady!"

With that she swayed and, wrapped in a breath of fragrance, darted toward that direction.

Yang Kai was stunned and turned; he saw a woman in red, dressed like a young married woman, looking his way.

Their eyes met, and both were momentarily dazed.

The young woman was ravishing to the utmost, seemingly born with a charm that could topple the world and drive any man to madness; her beautiful eyes glittered like stars, bewitching and soul-stealing, able to captivate the hearts of all who saw them.

Her figure was sinuous, her twin peaks full; the scarlet robes could not conceal that proud form but instead traced it in full; her skin outshone frost and snow, and her fingers were like fresh green scallions.

The bewitching woman seemed unable to believe her eyes when she saw Yang Kai; her body trembled slightly.

"Shan Qingluo?" Yang Kai whispered, his voice failing.

Although seeing Biluo had already told him that Shan Qingluo had also entered the Imperial Garden, he had not expected their meeting to be so theatrical; in any other place Yang Kai would have been pleased, but at this moment...

Yang Kai turned his head and saw Xue Yue staring at him, her beautiful eyes flashing an unnamed fury and a hatred tangled with love.

Yang Kai's mouth twitched; he knew there was no chance of withdrawing now. With Shan Qingluo present he could not simply leave, and in any case Xue Yue would never allow him to walk away unscathed.

Although he hadn't spent long with her, Yang Kai knew Xue Yue possessed an overpowering need to control: either one showed submission to her, or she would destroy them.

Ever since he had left Rainfall Star without a backward glance, the relationship between the two had turned from friendship to enmity.

The situation was delicate—the experts on Shan Qingluo and Xue Yue's sides seemed to be in a standoff before Yang Kai arrived, and Shan Qingluo was standing right in front of the stone stele that harbored the ways of artifact forging; it appeared she had been probing the stele's hidden mysteries.

“Heh heh…” Yang Kai gave a dry laugh. “Third Young Master, fate truly works in mysterious ways — we meet again.”

“Yes, we meet again.” Xue Yue actually smiled at Yang Kai. Though dressed as a man, that smile carried boundless allure—no less enchanting than Shan Qingluo’s own. “So it seems the one who followed me into the Imperial Garden that day… was indeed you?”

"If I said it wasn't me, would you believe me?" Yang Kai shrugged.

"What do you think?" Xue Yue said, lightly baring her silver teeth.

"Third Young Master, do you know this man?" asked an elderly figure with three long whiskers beside Xue Yue, eyeing Yang Kai suspiciously.

"Mm, I know him—an old acquaintance," Xue Yue said, lips curling; the weight on the last few words made it plain how much contempt she felt for Yang Kai.

The elder gave a slight nod, and his gaze toward Yang Kai brimmed with malice. A mere First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—no matter his origins, anyone who offended the Third Young Master would be left with no burial.

The old man had not the slightest regard for Yang Kai; he was plainly waiting for the Third Young Master's command to take Yang Kai's head.

"Ahem…" Yang Kai coughed and looked apologetically at Xue Yue. "Third Young Master, could you wait a moment? I have an acquaintance here I haven't seen for years—well, there are a few things to say."

"An acquaintance? You mean that yao woman?" Xue Yue's eyes flickered; she smiled lightly. "I've never heard you had dealings with yao, but suit yourself—carry on."

Saying that, Xue Yue casually opened her folding fan and fanned herself a few times, appearing the picture of nonchalance.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and, without employing any footwork, strolled toward Shan Qingluo.

The Enchantress Queen seemed still stunned—or rather, the unexpected reunion had robbed her of judgment. She stood rooted, red lips trembling as if to speak yet afraid that the sound would dissolve this vision.

Her emotions teetered between hope and dread.

Biluo was in her arms, crying with tear-streaked cheeks, feeling utterly wronged.

Perhaps infected by it, tears slowly clouded Shan Qingluo's beautiful eyes.

Within a few dozen zhang Yang Kai soon stood before Shan Qingluo, and as he drew closer her breathing grew rapid, her body trembled more violently, her face flushed, and the skin at her throat bloomed bright red.

The love seed Yang Kai had inadvertently planted in her body decades ago had been turned upside down; in front of him she could not keep composed—if anyone could control her, it would only be Yang Kai.

Even when she had met Lady Chi Yue back then she had never been so helpless; at that time, even if defeated, death was all there was. But now she felt her spirit melting; each of his footfalls was like a heavy drumbeat upon her heart, causing her feelings to quake.

“These years… Qingluo, have you been well?” After holding it in for a long while, Yang Kai finally managed to utter that single question.

He had always harbored some regret toward Shan Qingluo; after all, since he left the Cangyun Evil Land for the Tongxuan Continent they had not seen each other again—unlike Su Yan and Little Senior Sister, who could be seen again thereafter.

He had thought he would never see the Enchantress Queen again in his lifetime.

He had resigned himself to losing that ravishing woman forever.

Yet fate proved fickle—in this vast Star Domain, the two had a day of reunion.

Words piled at his tongue's tip, and Yang Kai did not know where to begin.

The familiar voice she had missed for nearly thirty years entered the Enchantress Queen's ears; Shan Qingluo could no longer restrain herself—tears silently slid down her cheeks as she trembled, "Tell me this isn't a dream!"

"It's not!" Yang Kai grinned and reached out to wipe her tears away.

Shan Qingluo closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and when she opened them Yang Kai still stood before her, his rough hand still caressing her cheek.

Everything felt utterly real, not the faintest illusion.

“You little bastard!” Shan Qingluo grit her teeth and cursed softly, then, wrapped in a swirl of fragrant wind, threw herself into Yang Kai’s arms.

Even though the situation was perilous, Yang Kai could not help feeling distracted; a woman like Shan Qingluo, when showing weakness, was an irresistible and dangerous temptation for any man.

But the next moment his expression changed; his face contorted.

Without warning, Shan Qingluo's madness showed—she grabbed the flesh at Yang Kai's waist and twisted hard with one hand while clinching the other into a fist and pounding him, as if venting years of grievance and longing.

To onlookers it might look like playful teasing, but Yang Kai knew she was striking with genuine force; while she would not truly wound him, the pain was unavoidable.

This enchantress…

Yang Kai was both angry and flustered.

But it was not over; after pounding him, she lifted her chin, rose onto her toes, her eyes full of grievance like a bitter housewife, and opened her small mouth to bite at Yang Kai's throat.

Everyone watched with mouths agape.

The seven or eight Origin Returning Realm experts on Xue Yue's side all shook their heads in disapproval, murmuring about propriety.

Before the eyes of all, she could behave so shamelessly, so devoid of decency—truly a demoness through and through, without the slightest sense of shame! And that brat being entangled by her clearly wasn’t any good person either. Who knew how Young Master Xue Yue had come to know such a man?

The Third Young Master was always reserved in conduct and would never associate with just any random riffraff — someone like that should by all rights not even be worth his notice.

"Enough!" a sudden shout rang out—Xue Yue could no longer bear it. Public flirtation aside, if matters continued the pair opposite might cross more lines; Xue Yue would not tolerate it.
