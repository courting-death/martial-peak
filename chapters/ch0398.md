## Chapter 398 — Sudden Attack

In Zhongdu, North District, Tongtian Inn.

Yang Kai, dressed in a set of azure battle attire, walked in with his hands behind his back, lifting his head with strides full of confidence. 

The slightly plump innkeeper’s eyes lit up, and he quickly greeted him with a smile, respectfully asking, “Is this young master here to stay or dine?”

Yang Kai had an exceptional appearance and arrived riding a Treading Cloud Steed. The innkeeper, having met countless people, instantly recognized Yang Kai's noble status and dared not show any disrespect.

“I’m here to find someone!” Yang Kai said indifferently, placing a segment of green bamboo on the table.

Seeing the bamboo, the innkeeper’s expression became extremely grave, and he hurriedly ran out from behind the counter, whispering, “Please follow me, young master.”

Yang Kai put away the token, nodded slightly, and followed the innkeeper with a calm demeanor.

Although Tongtian Inn was open for business, it only served as a facade; the true identity of Tongtian Inn was actually the lair of the Bamboo Segment Gang.

Zhongdu was not just home to the Eight Great Families!

There were also countless hidden forces operating in the shadows. These various forces were all supported by the people of the Eight Great Families, responsible for affairs that the Eight Great Families could not show themselves in. The Bamboo Segment Gang was just one of them, relatively small compared to the others.

After passing through the entire Tongtian Inn, they arrived at a vast courtyard where many martial artists were competing in martial skills, some one-on-one while others were engaged in group brawls, creating a lively atmosphere.

Yang Kai observed quietly and realized that the strength of those present was indeed low; at most, they reached the peak of the True Essence Realm, with the majority still at about the Separation and Union Realm, some even at the Qi Movement Realm.

In Zhongdu, the better martial artists were generally taken in by the Eight Great Families, leaving the remaining ones to be of mixed quality.

Yang Kai did not mind, but those martial artists engaged in combat, upon seeing the fat innkeeper leading Yang Kai in, glanced over in surprise, making comments about him.

Walking through the expansive courtyard, the two arrived in front of a large hall.

At the entrance of the hall were several intimidating martial artists, vigilantly surveying their surroundings. As soon as the two appeared, they all turned their gazes towards them.

Stopping his steps, the fat innkeeper cupped his hands in salute to them, smilingly saying, “Fourth Master Yang has sent someone, please inform the gang leader.”

One of the martial artists scrutinized Yang Kai from head to toe, frowning slightly with suspicion, “Why does this person look so unfamiliar? Is he one of Fourth Master Yang’s people?”

The fat innkeeper nodded repeatedly, “Of course. He bears the token from Fourth Master Yang.”

Only then did the martial artist nod, “Please wait a moment.”

Saying this, he turned and walked inside. After a short while, he returned, saying to Yang Kai, “The gang leader has instructed you to wait in the side hall; he will come after finishing his discussion.”

Yang Kai frowned. He hadn’t expected to be kept waiting.

This was getting interesting.

Inside the hall, it seemed there was a heated argument, with several voices ringing out.

Yang Kai extended his divine sense, which not only allowed him to perceive the cultivation levels of those inside but also to overhear snippets of their conversation.

His expression gradually turned colder, and he could not help but snort lightly.

“Esteemed young master, why not wait in the side hall for a moment?” the innkeeper cautiously suggested.

“No need, I will go in myself!” Yang Kai shook his head and stepped forward into the hall.

“Please hold on, sir!” The martial artist who had gone to announce their presence quickly blocked Yang Kai’s path. As he spoke, his body was suddenly sent flying, an intense burst of fiery True Essence erupting within him, colliding chaotically through his meridians. Before he could land, he fell unconscious.

With several dull thuds, the martial artists standing guard at the hall’s entrance all collapsed to the ground. The fat innkeeper hadn’t even regained his composure when Yang Kai arrived at the main door.

With a creak, the tightly shut door swung open, and Yang Kai slowly walked inside.

Inside were about a dozen martial artists, seated around a long table. Each had a dark expression, flush with anger, as if their argument had just escalated to a boiling point, their True Essence roiling within.

Yang Kai’s gaze shifted around before locking onto the man at the head of the table.

This man appeared scholarly and tall, dressed in a scholarly manner, exuding a mature, manly aura, though at that moment, a faint hint of worry and helplessness was etched on his brow.

He was the gang leader of the Bamboo Segment Gang, Pang Chi!

It was hard to associate his grand name with the elegant demeanor he possessed.

The sound of Yang Kai’s entrance naturally attracted their attention, and the moment he stepped in, the intense argument came to an abrupt halt. Everyone turned to look at him with expressions of surprise, several frowning subtly, their faces darkening.

However, what was more prevalent was a sense of apprehension. No matter what, Yang Kai was now considered a representative sent by Yang Yingfeng, and his status was apparent.

Pang Chi quickly stood up, waving his hand to dismiss the innkeeper who had followed him in, forcing a strained smile while cupping his fists in a greeting, “May I ask your esteemed name?”

“Yang Family, Yang Kai!” 

At these words, everyone’s expression changed dramatically!

They had thought that the person sent by Yang Yingfeng was merely one of his subordinates, as past interactions between the Bamboo Segment Gang and Yang Yingfeng were mostly handled by his subordinates.

But once they heard the name Yang Kai, they realized that the situation was quite different from what they imagined.

This young man was clearly a direct descendant who had recently returned to the Yang Family!

He was likely Fourth Master Yang’s son.

Realizing Yang Kai's esteemed and extraordinary identity, with a clatter, everyone stood up. Pang Chi even hurriedly descended to the lower level, respectfully saying, “Pang Chi was unaware of the young master’s arrival and did not come out to welcome you, please forgive me!”

“Please forgive me, young master!” everyone echoed in unison.

“It’s fine!” Yang Kai waved his hand indifferently, showing no sign of being offended.

Pang Chi finally let out a sigh of relief. He had been oblivious; allowing Yang Kai to wait in the side hall could have led to serious repercussions if the young master had taken offense.

For a moment, cold sweat began to bead on the back of Pang Chi's neck, and he was inwardly thankful.

“Please take a seat, young master!” Pang Chi urged.

Yang Kai did not stand on ceremony, directly walking to the head of the table and boldly taking a seat. Pang Chi forced a dry smile and stood beside him, feeling his lips turn sour. The others remained standing, feeling restless.

Having never interacted with the direct descendants of the Yang Family, they naturally felt a considerable psychological pressure. Furthermore, they did not know what Yang Kai had come for.

Recalling the earlier argument, several of them began to sweat nervously.

Yang Kai casually snatched a fragrant fruit from the table, leaning back in his chair with his feet resting on the table, adopting a comfortable pose as he began to eat.

Seeing him behave so rudely, essentially like a little rascal, everyone’s expressions relaxed slightly. They were no longer as tense as before.

Their backgrounds were lowly, and seeing Yang Kai’s lazy demeanor instinctively removed their anxiety.

“This tastes good.” Yang Kai took a few bites before casually tossing the fruit onto the table. He looked up and said, “You can sit down now.”

A group of people looked at Pang Chi, who nodded slightly. Only then did everyone take their seats.

Clearing his throat lightly, Pang Chi cautiously asked, “I wonder if the young master came to the Bamboo Segment Gang with any instructions from Fourth Master Yang?”

“No.” Yang Kai shook his head, “Just came over to have some fun, you don’t need to pay me any mind. It seems you were discussing something important; feel free to continue, I’d like to listen!”

With that, he smiled and scanned the crowd.

At this, the expressions of everyone changed slightly, and they all lowered their heads, falling silent.

Pang Chi chuckled awkwardly, “Actually, it’s nothing but trivial matters. You might find it boring to listen.”

“No problem, go ahead.” Yang Kai indicated that he was not bothered.

Pang Chi’s face was grim; he hadn’t expected this young master of the Yang Family to be so difficult.

Yang Kai straightened his posture and smiled again, “Earlier outside the hall, I seemed to hear someone mention the Huo Family… what’s the matter with the Huo Family? Tell me about it. I’ve been away from Zhongdu for many years and am not up to date on the news; I’m quite interested in what’s going on with the Huo Family!”

The expressions of the gathered people changed color in unison, shocked and terrified.

“Too scared to speak?” Yang Kai's voice turned cold, his gaze sharp.

“Young master, the matter is like this,” Pang Chi quickly began speaking. He understood that if he didn’t say anything, it would be over; this esteemed young master of the Yang Family had evidently caught wind of some information, which was why he was pressing them.

Before Pang Chi could finish, Yang Kai had already moved. His surging True Essence erupted, and a crimson hail of petals suddenly swirled in the hall. The sharp petals carried a chilling killing intent, swiftly enveloping the four seated before him.

Among them, three could not react in time and were pierced by the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia, leaving numerous invisible wounds all over their bodies, and without uttering a sound, they directly died.

Only one martial artist at the first stage of the Divine Roaming Realm managed to counter-attack in time and escaped a calamity. However, as he stood up from his chair, a blood-red sword energy struck at him.

Boom! The entire hall became chaotic as True Essence surged wildly, swirling with energy.

The man had just received a blow from the sword energy when his complexion changed drastically, evidently injured. Realizing Yang Kai’s terrifying and unreasonable nature, he dared not stay any longer and hurriedly flew towards the hall's exit.

Just before reaching the door, an innumerable number of petals followed closely behind, stacking up layers in front of him. In the next moment, like a hail of arrows, the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia fiercely attacked.

His expression changed again, and he quickly retreated.

A purple light exploded in mid-air, rendering the man dazed as intense pain surged through his sea of consciousness. He collided directly into Yang Kai with his back turned.

Yang Kai remained standing in place, holding the Chi Xue Sword, unfazed.

Puff!

The man collided directly with the Chi Xue Sword, his whole body pierced through like thin paper.

Slowly withdrawing the sword, blood sprayed forth, and that martial artist at the first stage of the Divine Roaming Realm crumpled uselessly to the ground.

Yang Kai then scanned the remaining people, his face stony, voice cold as he declared, “What about the Huo Family’s acquisition? I fear you all have money to take but no lives to spend!”

His thunderous voice echoed in their ears, causing all present to turn as pale as sheets.

Pang Chi looked at Yang Kai with terror and apprehension, his eyes trembling violently, cold sweat running down his spine.
