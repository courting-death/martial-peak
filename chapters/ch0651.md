## Chapter 651 — Volcano

It seemed that because Yang Kai had asked too many questions, Guan'er had lost interest in continuing to show him around; she hastily returned to the stone chamber, left Yang Kai behind, and vanished.

Recalling the events that had occurred the instant he had seen that Great Demon God statue, Yang Kai shook his head repeatedly, his face puzzled.

He did not know whether it had been an illusion or something else; there was no basis for deeply investigating it, so he could only set it aside.

Two days later, while meditating, Yang Kai sensed an uncanny fluctuation of energy nearby. He hastily opened his eyes and, to his surprise, found Li Rong and the icy woman Han Fei arriving together.

Yang Kai frowned, not understanding why even Han Fei had shown up, and asked, "Where is it?"

Li Rong shook her head. "We don't have it on hand. If you need it, you'll have to retrieve it yourself."

"I have to go get it myself?" Yang Kai exclaimed in astonishment.

"Mm. That's also why I had you wait two days—Leader Han Fei will escort you there," Li Rong replied.

Han Fei's territory lay on the other side of Mo Shen Fort; Li Rong had evidently sent word to summon her, which was why it had taken those two days.

Yang Kai glanced at the icy woman, inclined his head slightly, and, being sensible, did not ask further.

"If you're ready, we will depart now," Han Fei said without wasting words, looking at Yang Kai.

"There's nothing to prepare."

"Then let's go." Han Fei said as she turned and walked outward.

"Be careful on the way," Li Rong cautioned.

Yang Kai waved lightly and followed Han Fei outside.

Outside the stone chamber, Han Fei leapt and became a streak of light, disappearing. Yang Kai sniffed and stood where he was, not moving.

Li Rong looked him over curiously, a trace of suspicion on her pretty face.

After waiting a while and seeing Yang Kai still unmoving, Han Fei couldn't help but fly back; frowning in displeasure she asked, "What are you doing? Why aren't you following?"

"Like I said, I don't have much True Yuan to waste. Flying all the way would squander a lot of True Yuan," Yang Kai said helplessly.

"Then what do you intend to do?" Han Fei asked, her brows knitting slightly.

"You carry me there," Yang Kai said with perfect seriousness. Hearing this, Han Fei could not help being annoyed: "You have a lot of nerve, daring to ask me to take you?"

"I'm not trying to take advantage of you, nor am I disparaging your status. It's simply the correct choice," Yang Kai said solemnly.

Li Rong frowned slightly and gave Han Fei a small nod.

Han Fei grit her teeth, said nothing, waved her hand and cast a wave of energy that enveloped Yang Kai, then sped off into the distance with him.

There was no conversation along the way. Han Fei's cold, taciturn nature meant she would not befriend strangers; Yang Kai, not wanting to make a nuisance of himself, kept quiet and closed his eyes to rest as they rushed along.

Yet he keenly sensed that Han Fei seemed interested in him; her extremely concealed Divine Sense kept sweeping over his body, as if trying to probe something, though it repeatedly failed.

The world inside the Small Xuan Realm differed greatly from the outside: sun and moon indistinguishable, day and night chaotic; the vast, barren land seemed unable to support even an inch of grass, with few traces of life.

Occasionally, a few Demonic Beasts could still be seen.

They sped onward in silence for an unknown distance, and gradually the air took on a hint of scorching heat. Perceiving this, Yang Kai's spirit stirred!

That scorching breath was precisely the Yang attribute energy he craved.

As time passed the Yang attribute energy in the air grew ever richer and more concentrated, as if a vast convergence of Yang attribute energy lay ahead.

Yang Kai could not help but feel anticipation.

After a full two days, Yang Kai suddenly saw, at the distant horizon, the sky dyed with a dazzling hue, resplendent in gold and jade.

Here the Yang attribute energy already suffused heaven and earth. Yang Kai activated the True Yang Technique and drew into his body the Yang essence he needed.

Han Fei, however, had to slightly exert her own power to resist the erosive effect of the Yang attribute energy.

Yang attribute energy has always been the bane of demonic qi; even members of the Ancient Demon Clan cannot avoid it. Only elites like Han Fei can disregard ordinary Yang attribute attacks.

After another half day of flight, the Yang attribute energy thickened further. Han Fei stopped; the two of them hovered in midair and looked down.

Below rose a majestic mountain whose mouth gaped like a beast's maw, hideous and grotesque. Deep within that opening, Yang Kai could even see roiling, blazing-red magma.

The Yang attribute energy was so concentrated that the rocks here had already melted into magma.

From time to time, surges of magma would burst from the mountain mouth and flow downward.

Moreover, the Yang Source Seal on Yang Kai's chest was pounding relentlessly, seeming extremely joyful.

The Yang Source Seal responds only to Yang attribute energy. Yang Kai had never before felt the Seal fluctuate so strongly, which attested to how mighty the Yang attribute energy below was.

"This is the destination," Han Fei finally spoke. "There is an intense concentration of Yang attribute energy below; it should satisfy your needs. And as far as we know, beneath that magma there are vast deposits of Yang crystal ore. If you have the ability, go ahead and collect them—we of the Ancient Demon Clan have no use for such things."

Yang Kai nodded lightly to indicate his understanding.

"I'll send you down first and find a suitable place for you to cultivate," Han Fei said, then wrapped Yang Kai and plunged downward.

Facing magma so hot it could melt anything, the icy woman showed no fear; a surge of power burst from her delicate body that astonished Yang Kai, pushing the magma aside as they fell.

Like a blade, where Han Fei passed the magma parted and gave way.

In the wake of her passage there was no danger, but above, the magma flowed back and covered the route; Yang Kai looked up and could no longer see the way back.

Yang Kai at once developed a deep recognition of this woman's formidable cultivation.

A Saint Realm expert already ranked among the top masters; Yang Kai was unclear, however, which Stage of the Saint Realm this woman had attained.

He could not tell how many zhang they had fallen, and Han Fei appeared somewhat strained—this area’s Yang attribute energy was too dense even for her to ignore.

Moisture gleamed on her delicate body; an intoxicating scent drifted to Yang Kai's nose, jolting his spirit.

As if sensing Yang Kai's abnormality, Han Fei fixed him with a cold look, eased their descent, and asked in a low voice, "How is it here?"

"It's suitable," Yang Kai nodded.

"Then you will cultivate here," Han Fei said, slicing her hand through the air. The nearby magma split apart and a cavity opened in the rock face, just large enough for Yang Kai to sit cross-legged inside.

She then cast several seal-like energies to stabilize the space and tossed Yang Kai in, saying coldly, "Human, don't try any tricks. Absorb the Yang essence you need here; in one month I'll come to fetch you."

"Understood!"

Han Fei glanced at him once more, then sprang upward and soon vanished.

After she left, Yang Kai drew a light breath and probed the location where he stood.

This place was very safe, after all it had been created by a Saint Realm expert; the flowing magma outside could not intrude. Although Yang Kai did not fear the magma, being swept into it and losing his bearings would be troublesome.

Gathering his mind, Yang Kai began to operate the True Yang Technique.

As the formula ran, the millions of pores across his body opened simultaneously like a whale sucking in water, and the immense, concentrated Yang attribute energy around him poured crazily into Yang Kai's body.

Yang Kai wore an expression of delight, as if he had never experienced such a bone-gnawing sensation; he couldn't help but hum, his whole person feeling light and buoyant.

Tick…

A faint sound came from the depths of his mind; in barely thirty breaths' time a drop of Yang Liquid had formed.

Yang Kai's cultivation now was incomparable to past years; both the purity and the density of his True Yuan exceeded what they had been by dozens of times.

That meant that to condense a single drop of Yang Liquid, his body had to absorb dozens of times more Yang attribute energy than before.

Even so, he could still form a drop in such a short period.

The speed exceeded Yang Kai's imagination.

This environment was exceptionally suitable for his cultivation.

Tick…

Tick…

The light sounds continued without end; Yang Kai cultivated with great satisfaction and soon forgot everything around him, losing all sense of time's passage.

At the mountain's base, magma rolled; Yang Kai was lost in cultivation.

................................

A thousand li east of Mo Shen Fort lay the territory of Chu Jian, one of the four commanders.

At that moment, in the main hall Chu Jian was listening to a report from a trusted subordinate. After a moment Chu Jian narrowed his eyes, a trace of excitement appearing on his face: "You mean that outsider left Mo Shen Fort?"

"Yes, my lord; he was taken away by Leader Han Fei," the subordinate hurriedly replied.

"Do you know where he went?"

"It seems he went in the direction of the volcano."

"The volcano…" Chu Jian frowned. He naturally knew what that place was; it was a forbidden region of the Ancient Demon Clan, one even the four commanders were reluctant to tread lightly.

It wasn't that they feared for their lives, but they instinctively recoiled from the Yang qi there.

"What would he go to the volcano for?" Chu Jian's brows knit tightly; he could not fathom the reason.

If not for a special purpose, Han Fei would not have taken that human there.

"My lord, this is a rare opportunity. Should we…?" the subordinate asked hesitantly.

Chu Jian narrowed his eyes, a cold gleam flashing across them as he sneered, "Of course I know it's a rare opportunity. Very well—bring that outsider to my territory and have him as my guest for a few days!"

Chu Jian had been watching the various rumors about Yang Kai and knew he had made considerable progress in alchemy.

Chu Jian had long wanted to replace Li Rong; if he could bring that outsider back to his territory and cultivate him to refine that Saint-Grade Pill, breaking him free from this confinement, he would win the clan's favor, and Li Rong would have to step down.

Moreover, Chu Jian knew that Li Rong's medicinal stocks were running low while his own were plentiful. If the outsider wished to continue refining pills, he would have to supply the ingredients.

Chu Jian seemed to foresee that day; his eyes filled with anticipation and excitement as he hurried to begin making arrangements.
