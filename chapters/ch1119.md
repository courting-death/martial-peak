## Chapter 1119 — Prodigal Cultivation

Even if his heart stirred, Yang Kai showed nothing; he only asked calmly, "If your Space Array research truly succeeds, how far can it teleport?"

Yang Flame snorted, "Space Arrays are meant to break the bonds of distance — as long as you can precisely fix two points, distance is no obstacle."

"No distance limit?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

Yang Flame pondered for a moment, then said seriously, "In theory, yes, but the practical details still need careful study... so, will you give them to me or not?"

"I'll give them!" Yang Kai laughed heartily and waved his hand with a generous air — after all, there were so many Ethereal Crystals here that they could never be used up. When his friends and family came, he could even have Yang Flame craft a Spatial Ring for each of them.

"Thank you so much, you're the best!" Yang Flame was overjoyed, as if she wanted to throw herself at Yang Kai and kiss him. She immediately ran off to begin collecting; although she couldn't gather Ethereal Crystals as fast as the Stone Puppet, only the things placed into her own ring could truly be called hers.

Yang Flame understood that truth better than anyone.

Yang Kai wasn't nearly so shameless; after the initial excitement and elation, his mood slowly calmed. He watched the Stone Puppet gnaw through the Ethereal Crystal vein, watched layer after layer of dross seep from its body and flake away, and could not tire of the sight.

Years of nurturing and waiting had consumed so many precious ores; now there was finally a return — and the Stone Puppet's return was astonishing: the very first vein it found was Ethereal Crystal!

According to Yang Flame, the Stone Puppet was born with an uncanny sensitivity to rare ores. With it, any rare lode others couldn't find would be at Yang Kai's fingertips.

It was a pity he only had one Blood Essence Stone; with another one, the other Stone Puppet could likely be fully brought back to life.

The crunching and cracking never ceased; Yang Flame was out there gathering, sweat-soaked and energetic; the Stone Puppet worked with fiery zeal, leaving Yang Kai idle.

Half a day later Yang Flame came back gasping, took out a Saint Crystal to recover, and from her looks it seemed she intended to go mine more.

"What a pity," Yang Flame suddenly said.

"What pity?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Others only know Ethereal Crystals are used to forge Spatial Rings and to lay Space Arrays. In fact, they have another use."

"Oh? You know something others don't?" Yang Kai smiled. Although he hadn't spent much time with Yang Flame, she often had a way of impressing people — not with looks or figure, but with real skill — so he didn't underestimate her.

"They can also be used for cultivation," Yang Flame shook her head. "You didn't know? Most people don't know — yes, very few know."

"Ethereal Crystals can be used to cultivate?" Yang Kai froze. "They can be used like Saint Crystals? To absorb and enhance one's power?"

"Yes, but not for just anyone. They only work for a special kind of person — martial artists who understand spatial power can use them to cultivate and deepen their comprehension of space." Yang Flame babbled on, not noticing Yang Kai's expression turn odd. "Spatial power is esoteric and arcane; it's hard to enter, and mastering it is even harder. The remaining Space Arrays are all fashioned by those ancient spatial practitioners. The crafting of Spatial Rings was their development; we're only picking up scraps. I can say boldly that in the entire Star Domain, martial artists who know how to wield spatial power number no more than twenty, and among those twenty very few can use the power effectively in combat. Uh — what are you doing?"

Yang Flame turned and suddenly saw Yang Kai holding a piece of Ethereal Crystal refined by the Stone Puppet. She couldn't help laughing, "You wouldn't be trying to absorb the Ethereal Crystal's power, would you? Don't bother trying if you don't understand spatial power — you can't absorb it. But if you do understand spatial power, you can. Do you know why those people didn't study space more deeply? One: they didn't know to use Ethereal Crystals for cultivation; two: Ethereal Crystals are far too scarce — they simply couldn't afford to burn them. Cultivating this power is a money furnace; ordinary people can't pay for it."

As she spoke she fell silent, her eyes widening in disbelief as she stared at the Ethereal Crystal in Yang Kai's hand.

She seemed to detect a dark, mysterious energy pouring out from the crystal and being absorbed into Yang Kai.

She thought it was her imagination and watched more intently.

Energy was indeed flowing from the Ethereal Crystal like a little stream into Yang Kai's body — it wasn't an illusion!

"You..." Yang Flame's heart jolted.

"It actually works?" Yang Kai cried out with great delight.

In his study of spatial power he had always relied on the chaotic currents inside spatial rifts, but studying there was dangerous and yielded little. Since leaving the Floating Continent he had stopped doing that, for he had fallen into a bottleneck in his grasp of spatial power and such methods no longer helped.

After hearing Yang Flame's words today he couldn't resist trying, and the results were surprisingly good.

Ethereal Crystals really could be used for cultivation, to deepen one's mastery of spatial power.

Yang Flame could no longer contain herself and let out a sharp scream.

"Indeed — I'm one of those twenty," Yang Kai chuckled.

"My heavens, what sort of monster are you?" Yang Flame's face changed color. She had never imagined she would meet such a person. That Yang Kai was proficient in spatial power was even more incredible than the fact she herself was an Origin-Grade artificer.

"We're both people with secrets," Yang Kai nodded lightly. "I'll cultivate for a while; you go mine Ethereal Crystals — whatever you collect will be yours. Let the Stone Puppet refine them for you."

Saying that, Yang Kai ignored Yang Flame and held the Ethereal Crystal to cultivate.

Yang Flame stood stupefied for a long time before shaking her head.

The more she interacted with this man, the less she could understand him.

But Yang Kai's lack of reserve toward her comforted Yang Flame, and she didn't disturb him; she walked to the Stone Puppet and mined alongside it.

The energy within Ethereal Crystals was somewhat similar to that in Saint Crystals, but as Yang Flame said, not everyone could absorb it. Even Yang Kai, without activating spatial power, could not draw any energy from it — yet once he used spatial power he felt an exquisitely mysterious sensation flow from the Ethereal Crystal into his body.

That force was different from Saint Yuan; it did not strengthen the flesh, but as it grew Yang Kai clearly felt his understanding of space becoming ever more precise and profound.

Previously, feeling and comprehending spatial turbulence had been like rowing against the current: arduous, beset by difficulties and obstructions, and to grasp even a trace required huge expenditure of spirit and time.

But now things were different — the mysteries of space seemed to fling their doors wide open, letting him soar within and probe countless secrets.

He had never experienced cultivation of spatial mysteries so simply and effortlessly; exhilarated, he trained with abandon, forgetting sleep and the world around him.

Yet soon Yang Kai discovered a problem.

As Yang Flame had said, such cultivation was a supremely profligate affair.

Ethereal Crystals were consumed faster than Saint Crystals. One Upper-Level Saint Crystal would sustain Yang Kai for two hours of cultivation before its internal energy was exhausted.

But a fist-sized Ethereal Crystal refined by the Stone Puppet vanished from his hand in under an hour.

In a single day he would burn through a dozen-odd refined Ethereal Crystal essences — which calculated out meant at least hundreds of thousands of Upper-Level Saint Crystals!

Who could shoulder such a cost? Even a colossus like the Hengluo Commerce Guild would be hard-pressed; continued cultivation like this would soon lead to bankruptcy.

Fortunately the Stone Puppet had discovered such a large Ethereal Crystal vein, and fortunately Wu Yi had given this mountain for him to live on — Yang Kai was filled with relief.

Time flew; over ten days Yang Kai had consumed nearly two hundred Ethereal Crystals, and the batch the Stone Puppet had brought back last time had already been reduced by more than half.

Luckily the Stone Puppet kept on mining, and the underground cavern had now grown much larger, several times its previous size.

Hearing Yang Kai's summons, the Stone Puppet clattered over and opened its mouth, depositing yet another several hundred refined Ethereal Crystals piled before Yang Kai.

Yang Flame couldn't bear to look; she felt Yang Kai was a wretched slave-driver and the Stone Puppet a pitiable little laborer, toiling away only to have its gains taken by Yang Kai.

Storing those several hundred Ethereal Crystals into the Demon God's Secret Codex, Yang Kai resumed cultivation. He felt his comprehension of spatial power leap forward, and though he hadn't tested it yet, he reckoned that if he now tore open space the distances he could traverse would certainly no longer be limited to a thousand li.

That day the Ethereal Crystal in his hand vanished once more. He slowly opened his eyes and saw Yang Flame looking at him with an expression of hurt; she sat calmly before him, dirt streaking her body, her hands cupping her delicate cheeks as she pouted and stared at him.

"Why aren't you mining anymore?" Yang Kai asked.

Yang Flame stuck out her lips. "I realized I don't need to go toil — let Xiaoxiao gather. If I need anything, I'll just come to you."

"Xiaoxiao?" Yang Kai frowned.

Yang Flame pointed to the Stone Puppet there, diligently and earnestly gnawing at the Ethereal Crystal; only then did Yang Kai realize she had given the little creature a name.

She smiled, "Finally noticed?"

"You're perfectly content to enjoy the fruits of its labor; why should I be the laborer?" Yang Flame stood, gave her backside a pat and said, "Let's go up; leave the Ethereal Crystals to it — I still have instruments to refine."

Yang Kai thought for a moment, then nodded, "All right."
