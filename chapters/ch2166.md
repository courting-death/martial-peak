## Chapter 2166 — Way Out

“Dragon’s breath…” Xiao Baiyi cried out in shock. From where Yang Kai stood, he could sense the aura of a True Dragon. Though the aura was not strong, its innate terrifying pressure made his heart tremble violently.

As soon as he finished speaking, a dazzling golden dragon phantom suddenly appeared behind Yang Kai. The dragon’s massive form coiled behind him, slowly opening its eyes to glance in Xiao Baiyi’s direction.

Cold sweat instantly drenched Xiao Baiyi’s back, and he couldn’t help but stagger back a few steps.

“Brother Xiao Bai, your strength is impressive, so I must take this seriously too. You… be careful!” As Yang Kai spoke, his sword vibrated, and in an instant, multicolored rays burst forth. The Five Elements Indestructible Sword Qi surged in all directions, instantly dispersing the sea of thunder and revealing Yang Kai’s imposing figure.

The golden dragon phantom behind him roared at the sky. As its dragon cry echoed through the heavens and earth, it transformed into a stream of light, pouring into the sword. With Yang Kai’s slash, it howled forth.

In that moment, time seemed to stretch for tens of thousands of years, traversing countless eras. The True Dragon’s might was enough to shatter the ends of the world.

Cold sweat streamed down Xiao Baiyi’s temples. Forced back by the endless pressure, he gritted his teeth and stood firm, fiercely urging his Origin Qi. A barrier of stars formed around his body for protection. At the same time, he summoned a mirror-like Secret Treasure, which turned into a curtain of light to shield him.

Boom…

The golden slash struck, its violent energy overflowing. The entire Platform of Discourse buzzed incessantly, as if the end of the world had arrived. The surging Spiritual Qi fluctuations lingered for a long time.

Yang Kai’s gaze was as sharp as a blade, coldly staring ahead.

A dozen zhang away, Xiao Baiyi stood pale in midair. The light curtain formed by the mirror Secret Treasure still shielded him, but it was riddled with cracks. In the next breath, it shattered into countless fragments with a crash.

His eyes trembled violently, and the divine weapon in his hand couldn’t stop letting out mournful cries.

Staring across the void, Xiao Baiyi gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “You’re only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm… How can you possibly reach this level?”

Yang Kai replied calmly, “Strength isn’t judged by cultivation alone. Brother Xiao Bai, don’t you understand this principle yet?”

“I don’t believe it!” Xiao Baiyi roared, and a wild aura suddenly erupted from his body. The Origin Qi that should have been dormant surged forth. He swept his longsword and shouted, “This is my final move! If you can withstand it, you win. If not, only death awaits!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn. He knew Xiao Baiyi was about to use his ultimate technique—a desperate move at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, not easily endured.

He immediately held his breath and focused, secretly urging his Origin Qi.

As Xiao Baiyi finished speaking, his expression became incomparably solemn, his face filled with reverence. He flicked his finger on the sword. As the blade hummed, his whole body turned into countless rays of light, descending from the sky.

An astonishing pressure suddenly descended. The void trembled, making one feel as if the world was collapsing.

A deep chant slowly echoed: "Heavenly Sword, Shattering Stars!"

As the words fell, countless balls of light exploded in the sky, crashing down like a rain of meteors. There was no escape, only despair.

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with divine light. Instead of retreating, he advanced. Abandoning his sword, he formed seals with both hands. Spatial Force swirled around him, and the Laws Of Space suddenly filled the air.

Countless pitch‑black Moon Blades shot upward to meet the falling radiance. With thunderous booms, one black hole after another tore open in the void, devouring that inconceivable, world‑ending impact until nothing remained. The fierce surges of power rattled the mind and soul, as though the entire Platform of Discourse were about to sink away.

Yang Kai moved like lightning, flickering through the void, searching for Xiao Baiyi’s figure.

Suddenly, his eyes narrowed. He urged his Origin Qi and struck a certain spot with his palm.

“Pa…”

As the sound rang out, two muffled groans followed. Yang Kai, face ashen, staggered back a few steps, while in the empty void, Xiao Baiyi appeared, pale and weak, falling downward in unwillingness.

All the strange phenomena vanished in an instant, leaving only the solemn atmosphere of battle in the air.

Xiao Baiyi crashed heavily to the ground, then immediately flipped upright like a carp. But he couldn’t stand, his body swayed, and he had to lean on his sword to keep from falling.

All the exposed skin on his body was cracked, and blood flowed endlessly from within.

On his chest, there was a clear palm print.

Only that palm strike was Yang Kai’s doing; the rest of the injuries were not caused by him!

Yang Kai hovered in midair, looking down at his own hand. Blood was flowing from it, the entire palm pierced through and aching unbearably. The wound seemed to be infused with a trace of Law Power, hindering its recovery.

He shook off the blood, urged his strength to dispel the lingering Law Power, and said calmly, “Brother Xiao Bai, this Heavenly Sword move seems beyond what you can control. Was it really necessary to go this far?”

Though Yang Kai had no idea what secret art Xiao Baiyi had cultivated, that final sword was clearly beyond what he could wield at this moment. Forcing it would inevitably rebound on him, and his current condition was the clearest proof.

“Hahaha!” Though Xiao Baiyi looked miserable, he couldn’t help but laugh heartily, his laughter full of joy and satisfaction, with no regret or resentment. He said, “Of course it was necessary! Facing a strong enemy, one must use everything they’ve learned. Either you die or I do—what’s a little backlash injury?”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, “Brother Xiao Bai truly has the heart of an expert! I admire you!”

Xiao Baiyi slowly shook his head, “It’s a pity I still couldn’t beat you… First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm… Heh…”

He gave a bitter laugh, his tone extremely complex, full of emotion. Before this, he’d never imagined he would one day lose to a First Stage Dao Origin Realm opponent. He was a favored son of heaven, proud and aloof, and in this world, few were worthy of his attention.

But today’s battle taught him much. He felt like someone standing in waist-deep river water, claiming to have seen the ocean… utterly ridiculous.

“Yang Kai!” Xiao Baiyi called out, tossing his sword aside and swaying, “Go ahead!”

He looked ready to accept his fate, not planning to resist.

After all, even his strongest move had been miraculously countered by Yang Kai. He had no strength left to fight.

“I never said I’d kill you.” Yang Kai grinned. “You’re the only one shouting about life and death, aren’t you?”

Xiao Baiyi frowned, “If you want to move forward, you have to act. Otherwise, we might be trapped here forever!”

“Not necessarily!” Yang Kai denied his view.

Indeed, as he’d said before, he and Xiao Baiyi had no grudges, so there was no need to kill. Besides, during their fight, Xiao Baiyi hadn’t shown any killing intent, only high fighting spirit.

Clearly, Xiao Baiyi didn’t want to kill him either—he just wanted to battle Yang Kai!

This is exactly the mindset a martial artist seeking the peak of the Martial Dao should have.

As he spoke, Yang Kai looked around, searching for an exit from the Platform of Discourse.

But this place was just a lonely high platform suspended in midair, surrounded by endless abyss, pitch-black and bottomless. Ghostly wails echoed below, as if something ominous filled it.

“Is the exit below?” Yang Kai came to the edge of the Platform of Discourse and looked down, feeling the strange aura rising from below. He couldn’t help but feel his scalp tingle—if he really jumped, who knew what would happen?

Yang Kai secretly decided not to jump unless absolutely necessary.

Actually, he had another way to get through this place.

According to Xiao Baiyi, the exit from the Platform of Discourse only appeared after someone died. If so, he could put Xiao Baiyi into the Xuan Realm Pearl, and the exit might appear.

But… that would expose the secret of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

So, he tried to use Spatial Force to see if he could teleport away, but the next moment, he shook his head.

Spatial Force could be used, and teleportation worked, but only within the Platform of Discourse itself.

This place seemed to be an isolated space—Yang Kai couldn’t teleport to the outside world.

"You won’t find it!" Xiao Baiyi saw him running around and couldn’t help but warn, "I told you before, I’ve already searched this place thoroughly. There’s no exit. I’ve lost, and you don’t even have the courage to give the loser a proper ending?"

Yang Kai turned to look at him, just about to speak, when the entire Platform of Discourse suddenly buzzed and began to shake.

Yang Kai’s expression changed, and he quickly released his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings.

Xiao Baiyi was clearly startled too, not knowing what was happening.

But soon, a surprising scene unfolded.

In the sky, three large characters suddenly split into two beams of light—one large and one small. The smaller beam shot toward Xiao Baiyi, instantly enveloping him before he could react. With a slight flicker, he disappeared.

Xiao Baiyi vanished along with the light!

The other beam connected heaven and earth, twisting and transforming into a bridge of light leading upward. At the end of the bridge, a tightly closed door could be faintly seen, leading to an unknown world!

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, frowning in thought. He looked at the bridge and muttered, “This thing must be the road to the exit… Looks like Brother Xiao Bai was teleported out, so… the key is for him to admit defeat himself?”

Judging by what just happened, it seemed that only after Xiao Baiyi admitted defeat did the Platform of Discourse change, teleporting him away and revealing the way out.

Looking at it this way, the key to advancing was plainly revealed.
