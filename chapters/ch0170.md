## Chapter 170 — Haicheng

Not long after, Yang Kai returned with a cold expression.

“How is it?” the lady asked anxiously.

“They're all dead.” Yang Kai shook his head. Zhang Ding and his group had acted decisively; those who were killed in their sleep had all died with a single blow, and those who had perished in battle were also devoid of life.

Among the entire caravan, only Yang Kai and the three women remained alive.

The sound of the young lady's sobbing came from the carriage, while Cui’er rubbed her eyes vigorously. The lady, having weathered many storms, held back her tears despite the sorrow in her heart.

“People die for wealth, and birds die for food…” the lady murmured softly, as if mocking or lamenting.

After a moment of sadness among the three women, Yang Kai spoke up, “What are you planning to do? Do you still want to go to Haicheng?”

The lady raised her head and nodded slightly, looking at Yang Kai with hope. “Can you escort us through this stretch?”

This was a desolate area, and after experiencing such a tragic event, how could they dare to travel alone?

Cui’er also grabbed Yang Kai’s arm, looking pitiful. “Little beggar, you can’t abandon us.”

“Cui’er.” The lady reprimanded sternly, “Do not be rude.”

It was one thing to mistake Yang Kai for a little beggar before, but now that he had saved their lives, calling him that seemed uncultured.

Yang Kai glanced at Cui’er and nodded. “It’s only a day’s journey. I’ll escort you there.”

“Thank you, young hero.” The lady sighed in relief upon hearing this.

“I knew you wouldn’t abandon us.” Compared to the lady’s cautious demeanor, Cui’er appeared much more natural and generous.

The young lady, who had been silent until now, finally spoke up in a voice as soft as a mosquito’s buzz to express her gratitude.

“The stench of blood is thick here; it may attract wild beasts. We should set off now. By tomorrow evening, we should reach Haicheng.” Yang Kai said.

The lady hesitated for a moment, then said, “Young hero, may I trouble you with one more thing?”

“What is it?” Yang Kai looked at her.

“Many of those who died tonight were protecting us. I cannot bear to leave their bodies exposed in the wilderness. Could you…” 

Before she could finish, Yang Kai’s brow furrowed. It was one thing to ask him to kill, but burying the dead was too much to ask. So many bodies… how much effort would that require?

The lady was perceptive. Sensing his reluctance, she forced a smile. “In that case, we won’t trouble you. Cui’er, come with me and the young lady to bury Old Wu. As for the others… let it be.”

“Okay.” Cui’er nodded, then looked at Yang Kai, unafraid, and waved her small fist at him.

Yang Kai’s expression remained neutral as he stepped aside, not stopping them.

Cui’er helped the lady and the young lady down from the carriage. The three women trembled, their faces pale as they picked up swords and knives from the corpses nearby, holding them tightly as they searched for a spot to dig a grave.

Old Wu must have been very important to this family; otherwise, the lady wouldn’t have insisted on giving him a proper burial.

While the three women dug, Yang Kai walked around, collecting valuables from the dead.

After he finished his rounds and returned to them, he found that the three had only managed to dig a pit less than an inch deep. The lady and the young lady, having lived in comfort, were clumsy and covered in dirt as they worked, almost injuring each other with their weapons.

Yang Kai watched in horror, his heart racing.

“The stench of blood is too strong here; we might attract a pack of wolves. We won’t be able to escape.” Yang Kai said, smacking his lips.

The lady and the young lady turned pale at once.

Cui’er, furious, tossed aside the large knife in her hand. She stormed up to Yang Kai, her small fists pounding against his chest as she shouted, “You’re just making sarcastic remarks! I’ve been feeding my snacks to the wolves these past few days!”

Just then, a distant wolf howl echoed, making Yang Kai’s earlier words ring true. The lady and the young lady were terrified, and Cui’er no longer dared to act recklessly, quietly inching closer to Yang Kai, glancing around nervously. “Could it be… there really are wolves?”

“Alright, alright. You all go gather the valuable items; I’ll handle this.” Yang Kai said, utterly helpless.

If the lady had only asked to bury Old Wu, Yang Kai wouldn’t have refused. After all, he had gained some insights into martial arts from Old Wu over the past few days.

But once words were spoken, they couldn’t be taken back, and it was indeed awkward to retract his offer. Now, he finally found an opportunity to do his part.

“Thank you, young hero.” The lady sighed in relief and called for the young lady and Cui’er to tidy up in the second carriage.

Not long after, Yang Kai dug a large pit and buried Old Wu’s body inside.

Meanwhile, the three women had finished gathering their valuables, taking what was precious and leaving behind the less valuable items, which would be left for whoever found them.

“Let’s go.” Yang Kai helped them into the carriage, then sat at the front, holding Old Wu’s whip. Following the traces of insight he had gained from the past few days, he flicked it, and with a loud crack, the horses began to run.

By nightfall, they had distanced themselves from that bloody place.

Although it was Yang Kai’s first time driving a carriage, he quickly got the hang of it. As he wielded the whip, the martial arts traces he had learned from Old Wu became increasingly profound, and he gradually immersed himself in it, integrating it with his own understanding.

By the next morning, Cui’er came out and said they should stop to rest for a while, and Yang Kai agreed.

They started a fire to cook. Cui’er was busy, and after the events of the previous night, the three women inside the carriage felt utterly unsafe and hadn’t slept a wink. Although they had little appetite now, they still needed to eat something to regain their strength.

When they resumed their journey, Cui’er didn’t return to the carriage but sat beside Yang Kai, glancing at him curiously.

“You’re not really a little beggar, are you?” After a while, seeing that Yang Kai didn’t respond, Cui’er couldn’t help but ask.

“Of course not.” Yang Kai rolled his eyes.

“I guess you must be a young master from some noble family! You ran away from a marriage and spent all your money, so now you’re in such a sorry state.” Cui’er boldly let her imagination run wild.

Yang Kai chuckled. “Have you been listening to too many stories as a child?”

“I didn’t listen to stories when I was little. I just heard some interesting tales from the young lady in recent years, and there are many plots like this. Then, you poor young masters end up encountering…” 

Before she could finish, a light cough came from inside the carriage.

Cui’er quickly stuck out her tongue.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and continued to flick the whip.

An hour later, Yang Kai felt a warning in his heart. He looked up and suddenly said, “There are people blocking the road ahead. I wonder what they want.”

A surprised voice from the lady came from behind. “They might be from the Miao family.”

The Miao family was the family the lady intended to seek refuge with. During their casual chats over the past few days, Yang Kai learned that the young lady had a betrothal agreement with the young master of the Miao family. After the master’s death, the lady brought the young lady to Haicheng, not only to escape but also to arrange the young lady’s marriage. They would likely settle in Haicheng afterward.

“Did you send a message to the Miao family earlier?” Yang Kai asked.

“Yes.”

“Then when we get closer, I won’t accompany you any longer.” Yang Kai also sighed in relief.

Cui’er nervously asked, “Are you leaving already, little beggar?”

“Do you not want me to leave?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow at her.

“Go die!” Cui’er’s face turned red. The lady and the young lady were behind her; how could this rascal tease her?

Clearing his expression, Yang Kai said, “Lady, I hope you won’t disclose anything about me from last night.”

The lady was taken aback, recalling Cui’er’s bold speculation earlier. Could it be that he was indeed a young master who had run away from a marriage? That was why he didn’t want to reveal his identity?

Thinking this, the lady nodded. “Rest assured, young hero. Last night, we merely received help from a noble person.”

“That’s best.” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

Before long, the carriage arrived in front of the group blocking the road.

The foremost person cupped his fists and asked loudly, “May I ask if there are people from the Jiang family in the carriage?”

The lady’s voice came out, “Indeed.”

The man was overjoyed, dismounting his horse and saying, “I am Miao Huacheng, here to welcome you, sister-in-law!”

As he spoke, his voice choked with emotion. “It has been ten years since I last saw Brother Jiang. I never expected it to be a final farewell. All the past is like yesterday, vividly remembered!”

Inside the carriage, the lady and the young lady’s sobs could be heard. Cui’er’s eyes were also red.

The lady said, “Dear brother, please do not be too sorrowful.”

Miao Huacheng replied, “Sister-in-law, do not grieve too much.”

A solemn and sorrowful atmosphere enveloped them.

After a long while, Miao Huacheng said, “Sister-in-law, you have traveled a long way. Please endure for half a day more; we will soon arrive in Haicheng.”

As he spoke, his gaze swept over Yang Kai, frowning. “Why is there a little beggar here?”

The lady, being perceptive, briefly recounted what had happened last night, concluding with, “None of us can drive a carriage, so we were fortunate to encounter a little beggar who helped us drive.”

“That damned Zhang Ding! He deserves to be torn to pieces!” Miao Huacheng was furious. After saying this, he looked at Yang Kai and said, “Little beggar, you can come down now. You’ve worked hard on this journey.”

Yang Kai complied and jumped down from the carriage.

Miao Huacheng signaled to one of his subordinates, who stepped forward and handed Yang Kai a silver ingot as payment. Yang Kai naturally accepted it without hesitation, pretending to be a beggar as he repeatedly thanked them.

“Let’s go!” Miao Huacheng ordered others to take Yang Kai’s place, then waved his hand, leading the group towards Haicheng.

As the dust settled, Yang Kai stood in place, noticing three pairs of eyes staring at him from the carriage window.

Though he felt sorrow for the widow of the Jiang family, it was merely a fleeting encounter, and they likely wouldn’t meet again.

Chasing after the direction the carriage had disappeared, Yang Kai walked along, holding the whip left by Old Wu, casually flicking it as he moved, his feet also adopting a corresponding movement.

Half a day later, they finally arrived at their destination.

This city was much larger than Wumei Town, but there was a faint fishy smell in the air. It wasn’t unpleasant; rather, it invigorated the spirit.

It was Yang Kai’s first time visiting a coastal city. Although he was excited, he first went to buy some clothes and found an inn to stay temporarily.

He didn’t have to worry about money; he had gained a considerable amount from the valuables he collected last night.
