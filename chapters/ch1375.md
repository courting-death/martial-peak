## Chapter 1375 — Hard to Ride the Tiger

His change in expression did not escape Yang Yan’s notice. Seeing that he seemed to have lost interest in the Spirit Storage Pearl, Yang Yan pursed her lips in a faint smile and said, “It’s a fine item, but its use has its limits—you don’t need to feel regret over it.”

"Oh? What limits?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Hmph. The item may be fine, but Nephew Ren, there’s no need to exaggerate it so much. If this pearl has any restrictions or requirements for its use, why don’t you tell us all of them?” Before Yang Yan could respond, Yang Kai heard a voice booming from one of the private rooms—majestic and resonant, filled with authority.

It seemed Yang Yan wasn't the only one familiar with Spirit Storage Pearls, Yang Kai thought inwardly.

Ren Tianrui glanced that way and smiled slightly, cupping his fist as he spoke, "So it's Senior Cheng of Leitai Sect — Senior, you see straight through it. Though this Spirit Storage Pearl is convenient, it does indeed have some restrictions. Even if you did not ask, I was prepared to explain in detail; I would not have the friends attending this auction buy it in ignorance. Jubao Tower still has its reputation to maintain."

Hearing him speak, the Cheng warrior snorted lightly, neither confirming nor denying; whether he believed the words was a matter only heaven knew.

Many quietly guessed that if no one had spoken up to question it, Ren Tianrui would not have disclosed those restrictions; at most he'd notify the buyer discreetly after the auction — that would be doing his duty.

This wasn’t the first time Jubao Tower had done something like this.

"Who is that?" Yang Kai looked toward where the voice had come from and asked the young woman.

Although Qing'er wasn't highly cultivated, she was native to Dark Star and could guess the speaker's identity. Upon Yang Kai's question a trace of surprise flashed across her eyes; as if puzzled by his asking, she replied, "If I'm not mistaken, it should be Senior Cheng Pengxuan of Leitai Sect. After all, within Leitai Sect the only expert with that surname is him."

Yang Kai nodded faintly, satisfied with her answer.

Meanwhile, Ren Tianrui was already explaining the Spirit Storage Pearl's restrictions.

It wasn't entirely disappointing — the pearl had been acquired by Jubao Tower from a fallen minor family. According to the seller, the Saint Yuan stored within the pearl had quantitative limits, roughly equivalent to the total Saint Yuan in a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior's body.

In other words, it cannot accept energy exceeding that of a Third Stage Saint King Realm practitioner's Saint Yuan; once exceeded, it would immediately leak out.

That restriction wasn't a huge problem. For Saint King-Grade warriors it made no practical difference; for Origin Returning Realm men it merely required caution not to store too much Saint Yuan in the pearl — it could still be used.

It was just that, in a critical moment the returned Saint Yuan couldn't restore one to peak condition.

Overall, that first restriction was harmless.

But the second restriction greatly reduced the pearl's value.

It was a Secret Treasure from antiquity, a refinement of ancient warriors. This pearl had been used many times already; the appraisers from Jubao Tower judged it could only be used perhaps three to five more times before it would be utterly ruined and permanently unusable.

At that, the fervor in many warriors' eyes instantly cooled. Though three to five uses wasn't negligible, spending such a fortune on an item that failed to increase one's long-term strength left them sober.

"Aside from those two restrictions, there is nothing else to note." Ren Tianrui seemed unconcerned about whether the auction item would fetch a high price; he smiled and announced, "Starting bid five hundred thousand Saint Crystals, increments no less than ten thousand — begin!"

Considering its use, that starting price was not unreasonable; after all it was the first item in the auction and Jubao Tower intended to draw a good sale.

Yet the figure of five hundred thousand instantly quashed the hopes of nine out of ten in the hall.

After all, a top-grade Secret Treasure of Saint King-Grade might only fetch around three hundred thousand; five hundred thousand as a starting bid was something most could neither afford nor easily bear.

Not everyone, however, was deterred — those attending had come prepared. No sooner had Ren Tianrui finished speaking than someone offered a price.

Soon the hall rang with successive calls of bids from every corner.

Each round of bidding was fairly steady, yet with so many people driving up the price, in just the time it took to drink half a cup of tea, that single Storage Spirit Pearl had already been pushed up to a price of eight hundred and twenty thousand.

By then, the bidding voices in the hall had thinned to only two or three.

"I'll offer one million!" Cheng Pengxuan's booming voice came from Leitai Sect's box.

Ren Tianrui on the high platform smiled slightly at the declaration, showing no surprise. With such an item it was only natural that a few major powers would join the competition.

The few martial artists who'd been bidding in the hall darkened in expression and sighed; with Leitai Sect involved they had little hope. Each secretly cursed Cheng Pengxuan for not bidding earlier — had they known he would, they wouldn't have bothered.

What rotten luck! Some even felt murderous.

"Haha, Old Cheng, you've reached the Third Stage of Origin Returning Realm — why stoop to contest this with juniors?" a voice from another box laughed, laced with mockery and teasing.

"Hmph, I don't need it for myself — can't I buy it for my disciples?" Cheng Pengxuan snorted. "Brother Mo's words are off the mark; since it's an auction, my participation is only natural. How is that shamelessly contending with juniors?"

“Fair enough!” The person inside that private room replied indifferently, his tone unhurried. “Very well, this Mo will join in the fun too—can’t let Brother Cheng have all the glory. One million one hundred thousand!”

“Old Ghost Mo, have you ever heard of letting others accomplish their good deed?” Cheng Pengxuan’s voice sounded somewhat displeased. “One million two hundred thousand!”

“Brother Cheng just said it himself—this is an auction, and naturally the highest bidder wins. One million five hundred thousand!”

"Very well, then let's wait and see — two million!"

"……"

The two traded barbs like old rivals, each unwilling to yield. In the blink of an eye the Spirit Storage Pearl's price had multiplied many times, and judging by the tone it would likely become even more outrageous, leaving the hall's warriors agape.

"The Mo surname?" In box number thirteen Yang Kai frowned and looked toward the rival box.

"That should be Mo Xiaosheng of the Battle Sky Alliance — Elder Mo!" Qing'er hurriedly explained.

Yang Kai nodded faintly; even without Qing'er's explanation he had heard people mention Mo Xiaosheng several times. He'd kept an eye on the man because, like him, Mo had cultivated space power.

That was an extremely rare branch; across Dark Star there was no third practitioner known to have cultivated it.

In the study of Space Power, Yang Kai was confident he would not lose to this Mo Xiaosheng. If it came down to a contest of Space Power alone, Yang Kai reckoned he could utterly crush the other to death—after all, the Space Blade, such a devastatingly lethal technique, was not something just anyone could comprehend.

Still, given Mo's age he might possess unique insights into spatial matters, and he should not be entirely underestimated; perhaps some exchange could be gainful.

But that was impossible. The Battle Sky Alliance’s way of doing things was truly despicable—if he were to reveal his mastery of Space Power, it would only bring disaster upon himself.

Yang Kai dismissed the thought as quickly as it came.

Down on the platform Ren Tianrui had opened his folding fan and fanned gently with the grace of a refined scholar, wearing a soft smile as elders from the two great powers exchanged bids like a chorus in his ears — he felt amused.

Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect had long been at odds; this contest over the Spirit Storage Pearl was as much a clash of face as of wealth, and neither side would back down.

An incense stick later, Cheng Pengxuan shouted out the sky-high price of ten million Saint Crystals, causing an uproar among the cultivators in the hall.

To be fair, the Spirit Storage Pearl was excellent, but that price was shocking; had Mo Xiaosheng not entered the fray, it surely would not have climbed so absurdly.

Up to now both Cheng Pengxuan and Mo Xiaosheng were secretly enraged — they both knew such battle only benefited Jubao Tower, and now they were stuck on a tiger's back, forced to swallow bitter humiliation.

Ten million—though not an unbearable sum for either faction, it was by no means something to squander lightly. One had to know that such an amount of Saint Crystals was enough to support many disciples’ cultivation for an entire lifetime, whereas the purchased Storage Spirit Pearl could only be used by a single person.

The two Third Stage Origin Returning Realm experts cursed the other in their hearts even as they grit their teeth and bid.

After the ten million call, the Battle Sky Alliance fell quiet; it seemed Mo Xiaosheng was weighing whether to continue.

At that moment, an abrupt voice suddenly rang out.

“Ten million and ten thousand!”

In an instant nearly every gaze focused on the bidder — astonishingly, it was not from one of the private boxes but a young martial artist among the crowd.

His cultivation was not high, only Third Stage Saint King Realm; his clothes plain and simple. Such men were numerous on Dark Star, and from his position among the hall bidders it was clear his background was humble.

Yet the price he shouted moved people, and more than that, his daring and audacity earned admiration.
