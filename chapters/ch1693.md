## Chapter 1693 — Infinite Body Usurpation

Five days later, Yang Kai and Qian Tong stared at the corpse before them with ugly expressions.

The body was not of the Corpse Spirit Race, but belonged to a human martial artist of low cultivation — only the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Yet this was already the twenty-seventh body the mysterious leader of the Corpse Spirit Sect had usurped!

He did not seem to suffer damage to his soul from the usurpation; on the contrary, he could usurp different bodies without end.

This completely contradicted common knowledge Yang Kai held: when a powerful expert’s flesh perishes, the soul can indeed seek a suitable body to usurp, but usurpation is a dangerous act — it very likely backfires, allowing the target to devour the soul and cause total annihilation, and even if not devoured, each usurpation consumes enormous spirit power.

It was simply impossible for anyone to perform a second usurpation in such a short span!

Yet the mysterious leader of the Corpse Spirit Sect broke this rule; in barely five days he had usurped twenty-seven times. Although Yang Kai had caught him every time on the tail, pursued relentlessly, and even slew the bodies he usurped, each time the leader could withdraw his soul and escape alive!

After five days of pursuit without killing the Corpse Spirit Sect leader, Yang Kai and Qian Tong both sensed how troublesome this enemy truly was.

But it was not without gains.

They discovered the Corpse Spirit Sect leader could not usurp just anyone’s body—only those whose minds had been implanted with the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu could become his targets.

Yang Kai had encountered the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu once before; back then Xie Li of the Xie Family had been controlled by it and foolishly led his entire clan in an attack on Dragon Lair Mountain, ultimately being shredded beyond recognition.

This strange, insect-like existence was the Sect Leader’s secret art; once the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu was planted, any living being would obey his orders and follow him unquestioningly.

He used this method to enslave unruly subordinates and likewise to facilitate his usurpations and soul escapes!

As long as a Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu existed within a certain distance, his soul could ignore spatial limits and instantly reach the location of the Gu to usurp that body.

Beyond that discovery, Yang Kai and Qian Tong also keenly noticed that the bodies the Sect Leader chose to usurp were growing ever weaker.

At first, he could usurp bodies at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — the top-tier corpse generals — but within days he was reduced to selecting Second Stage bodies. Now he could only usurp those at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

His usurpation art was not flawless; it inflicted a certain degree of damage, presumably targeting the soul. Even the Corpse Spirit Sect leader could not avoid it.

Even so, Yang Kai and Qian Tong were exhausted and worn.

“Bring him on, he won’t get away much longer — I refuse to believe he can escape from me!” Qian Tong fumed, full of anger. Now that he had reached the Void King Realm and was the undisputed first among the Dark Star, this humiliation at the hands of a Corpse Spirit Sect leader enraged him.

Qian Tong did not realize the origins of this Corpse Spirit Sect leader were far grander than his own Void King Realm status.

“Have you tracked his movements?” Qian Tong asked, turning to Yang Kai.

After days of pursuit, Qian Tong knew the oddity of the Sect Leader: without Yang Kai tracking him, he alone could not eradicate the threat.

He could not detect the traces left when the Sect Leader’s soul fled.

Yang Kai closed his eyes to sense, and after a long moment suddenly opened them, wordlessly stretching out his hands to tear the void.

In a nearby thicket, a handsome but sinister young man fled in disarray. He looked no more than thirty, his body radiating Saint Yuan of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; his expression was wretched, his eyes bloodshot and terrifying, his face contorted.

He fled while suppressing his aura and sending his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings.

Within a radius of thirty li there was no sign of movement.

But the youth did not relax; instead he kept running as if something dreadful pursued him.

His face was full of viciousness, his eyes brimming with deep, unforgettable hatred.

Once famous even in that place, few dared provoke him. But after arriving in this Star Domain and falling to this Cultivation Star, his fortunes had steadily worsened: first Yang Yan beat him to pieces, and only after tens of thousands of years of slumber did he revive.

At this moment he was being hunted by a trash who had only reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, with no way out.

In his prime, a single look could have shredded that trash into a thousand pieces, yet now he had to flee.

The handsome but sinister youth felt the humiliation of a tiger fallen to the plains and bullied by dogs, a dragon swimming in shallow water being toyed with by shrimp; his qi and blood surged and he could barely breathe.

His soul escape technique was peerlessly exquisite; even a Void King Realm expert could not detect it. Yet that brat Yang Kai had rare spatial arts — if not for that, how could he have been caught at every turn?

Spatial arts were scarcely cultivated even in that place. He could not fathom how anyone here had refined such arts to profound depths, able to rend space and instantly move thousands of li.

As he raged and ground his teeth, a strange fluctuation of energy suddenly came from the void ahead.

The youth halted, his face turning ashen.

This had happened dozens of times already; he was not unfamiliar with it and knew what would come next.

“You forced me into this!” the youth snarled, eyes hard as if he had made a grave decision, and he stopped to wait in place.

The strange power fluctuation in front grew more pronounced; soon a rift tore open, black and void within, a chaos of nothingness.

Two figures stepped out of the rift. Leading was Qian Tong, with Yang Kai following behind.

As soon as Qian Tong appeared, his powerful soul locked onto the youth; without even uttering a greeting his Domain Field expanded, enveloping the youth. The wind’s profound intent swirled and within the Domain Field formed myriad killing strikes to cover the youth.

The youth’s usurped cultivation was only the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Qian Tong need not even act; relying on the might of his Domain Field alone, he could easily strangle him to death.

The youth laughed loudly: “Lowly ants, bear the full fury of my supreme wrath!”

He spoke and a jade-green breath poured from his mouth, the green aura writhing and twisting in the void before condensing into a jade-green long blade inscribed with dizzying runes and patterns.

The jade-green blade slashed down viciously through the air, silent.

To everyone’s shock, Qian Tong’s Domain Field was directly cut through by that blade, shattering in an instant.

At the same time Qian Tong and Yang Kai’s expressions changed drastically: in their sight the jade-green blade gathered a strange profound intent, pierced through the suppression of their souls, and struck directly into the Sea of Consciousness, taking the form of the jade-green blade and slashing down with thunderous force.

The Sea of Consciousness was sliced apart by the sharp qi, the whole ocean split in two, waves rising and wild winds blowing, the heavens and earth changing color.

The plane of the Sea of Consciousness visibly decreased in size.

Yang Kai and Qian Tong’s soul power was cut by more than one third by that single strike.

Both involuntarily groaned, their heads splitting with pain, vision blurring as they nearly fainted.

Their faces blanched — they had never expected the opponent to possess such a domineering move — and hastily they circulated Saint Yuan as a defense.

After unleashing that move the youth immediately turned deathly pale, swaying as if about to collapse; just as he intended to press the advantage and give Yang Kai and Qian Tong another slash, he found he had no strength left.

Cursing fiercely, the youth’s body suddenly burst into powder and vanished.

A soul force surged from where the youth had been, spun once in midair, gathered the jade-green aura that had taken the form of the long blade, tore through the void, and fled far away.

Yang Kai stared toward the direction of the escape and attempted to sense, but a strange profound intent filled the area, sealing the space and preventing him from tracking the youth further.

Pain pierced his mind again; Yang Kai gave a sharp cry, hastily produced a jade vial and took out some Spiritual Pills, handing half to Qian Tong and stuffing the rest into his own mouth, then sat cross-legged.

Seeing this, Qian Tong quickly swallowed his half of the Spiritual Pills and closed his eyes to regulate his breathing.

Only after a full day did Yang Kai slowly open his eyes, still showing traces of lingering fear.

He possessed a Warm Spirit Lotus of seven colours, so even with soul damage it was not too dire; a day of nurturance had mostly healed him.

As for Qian Tong, his injuries were severe. Even as a Void King Realm expert, suffering such a blow would take him more than a year to fully recover.

As if sensing Yang Kai’s gaze, Qian Tong opened his eyes; his complexion was somewhat pale, and after a long, hoarse moment he asked, “That fellow got away?”

Yang Kai silently nodded.

Qian Tong heaved a heavy sigh and murmured, “This man is extraordinary. I thought once I rose to the Void King Realm I could be invincible on the Dark Star, yet I’ve suffered a crushing defeat at his hands. The world is vast and full of hidden talents. What grade of Secret Treasure did he use to unleash such power?”

Yang Kai pondered and said, “Probably an Imperial Treasure.”

“An Imperial Treasure?” Qian Tong frowned, sensing the surrounding area and then nodding slowly. “That would make sense — there really is Imperial Might here, but why does it feel different from the Imperial Might I once sensed in the Imperial Garden?”

Yang Kai glanced at him, thinking there could be more than one Emperor-level existence in the world, but he kept that thought to himself.

It was that Imperial Might which sealed off Yang Kai’s spatial tracking and ultimately allowed the Corpse Spirit Sect leader to escape.
