## Chapter 1553 — Old Friends Reunited

"Good, good — nothing has changed." Yang Kai hovered in midair, his Divine Sense sweeping the entire Sacred Land, and he nodded in satisfaction.

Shi Kun was in a daze, having no idea how he had arrived at the inner peak, but he quickly realized it must have been Yang Kai's handiwork.

What kind of method was this? So strange — Shi Kun felt equal parts reverence and dread.

Suddenly, as if remembering something, he took a step forward, drew in a deep breath, and shouted toward the Nine Peaks, “The Saint Lord has returned to the Sect!”

The cry rang throughout the Nine Peaks, resounding without end.

The commotion across the Nine Peaks seemed drowned by that echo; an uncanny hush fell over the Sacred Land, so still there was no sound.

But after only a short while the Nine Peaks erupted into disorder; every peak was in an uproar as great streams of light burst forth and sped this way.

In an Alchemy Room, Saint-Grade alchemist Du Wan was refining a batch of Qingxue Pill — a Saint-Grade Lower-Level pill — and the supplicant waited outside the Nine Peaks with considerable status, so Du Wan was handling it personally.

It had taken more than a day, and Du Wan was about to complete his work; the Alchemy Room was filled with that distinct cool, pure fragrance. He was carefully controlling the furnace's heat, eyes full of expectation as he watched the cauldron, preparing for the final collection.

Beside him, Chang Bao sat with his large belly, layers of fat on his face, his small eyes narrowed and fixed forward, as if trying to glean techniques from Du Wan's method.

The two Saint-Grade alchemists wore expressions both solemn and excited.

One had once presided over the Alchemists' Association in Giant Stone City, the other had led the Alchemists' Association in Shining City; both had learned much within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and advanced to Saint-Grade alchemists, so they resigned their association posts and joined the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Besides them were Hong Fang, He Feng, and Kong Ruoyu — now all Saint-Grade alchemists as well.

The alchemical standard on the Tongxuan Continent experienced an explosive surge after Yang Kai left; all credit was owed to the unstinting instruction of Tianzang Elder Li Rui and the inspiration of Xia Ningshang.

Previously on the Tongxuan Continent, Li Rui had been the only Saint-Grade alchemist.

At the critical moment, Chang Bao's little eyes narrowed further; light flashed in them, as if he were sweating on Du Wan's behalf.

Even they could not guarantee a one hundred percent success rate when refining Saint-Grade pills; Du Wan's batch had come so far through a mixture of technique and luck.

The more crucial the moment, the less room there was for sloppiness — this was the most important juncture.

Just then, a shout suddenly came from outside. Its volume pierced the Alchemy Room's wards and reached the ears of the two Saint-Grade alchemists.

Du Wan's aged hand trembled and his True Yuan wavered.

Immediately, a soft popping sound issued from the furnace.

A scent of burning spread from the cauldron.

Du Wan froze, his face contorted with displeasure.

Chang Bao furrowed his brow as well.

It had failed at the final step!

That fool Shi Kun was done for! Du Wan would surely blame him for the pill's failure.

Chang Bao inwardly rejoiced at the thought.

"Old Chang, what did that Shi Kun shout just now?" To Chang Bao's surprise, Du Wan did not fly into a rage; instead he looked at him oddly and asked.

"I didn't catch it," Chang Bao shook his head.

Though they had heard Shi Kun call out, their minds had been entirely on the alchemy, so Chang Bao had not paid attention to the words.

"I thought I heard him shout 'Saint Lord'?" Du Wan frowned.

"Saint Lord?" Chang Bao was stunned, then suddenly, like a cat with its tail trodden on, sprang up with surprising agility. "You mean Saint Lord?"

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land had always had but one Saint Lord — Yang Kai.

Since Yang Kai's departure, the seat had remained vacant, yet in every practitioner within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land Yang Kai remained the Saint Lord in their hearts.

“I think I just heard Shi Kun shouting that the Saint Lord has returned to the Sect,” Du Wan said, scratching his head.

"Are you certain?" Chang Bao called out.

"Uh... I'm not certain either."

The two looked at each other for a moment, then both shot outside. When they opened the Alchemy Room door, they saw He Feng, Hong Fang, and Kong Ruoyu also sprinting from their rooms, rushing outward with a speed that belied their years.

"Old geezers, wait for me!" Chang Bao waddled his bulky body and shouted behind them.

No one paid him any mind; they all hurried outward.

On another peak of the Nine Peaks, in a mid-mountain secret chamber, demonic qi thickened.

Inside the chamber two fair women sat with eyes closed, cultivating: one dignified and elegant, the other cold and aloof, their temperaments utterly different.

The former had reached the pinnacle of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, the latter had reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

Both were wrapped in dense black demonic qi, a shocking sight; at that moment the two seemed to be practicing some secret art.

When the sound reached them, both involuntarily opened their eyes. The more dignified beauty looked to the other and asked with a slight frown, "Han Fei, did Shi Kun just say... the Saint Lord has returned to the sect?"

The cold, aloof beauty trembled at the question, thought carefully, and nodded slightly.

Their eyes met and both pairs of beautiful eyes suddenly flared with astonishing light; they abandoned their secret art, wrapped in black qi, and shot out of the chamber to fly outward.

The same scene played out across the Nine Peaks.

In decades past the Nine Peaks had never seen a day so lively as this; those usually revered across the Tongxuan Continent seemed to lose their composure in an instant and behaved like eager, fumbling young people.

Great Elder Xu Hui, in his rush, barreled through his own palace, smashing several walls — the palace nearly collapsed.

Elder Yu Ying overturned several favorite vases as she hurried out.

Saintess An Ling'er even burst from her bath, hastily throwing on clothes with wet hair.

......

All of this was caused by a single phrase echoing through the Nine Peaks.

"The Saint Lord has returned to the Sect!"

Everyone wanted to know whether the news was true; everyone wanted to see the face unseen for decades. At once they rushed from their places toward the source of the voice.

One by one streams of light raced over and converged before Yang Kai.

Each figure revealed themselves, and upon seeing Yang Kai’s face clearly, their expressions turned to a mix of shock and joy—some even wept tears of happiness, unable to contain their emotions.

The Sacred Land's Great Elders, Du Wan, Chang Bao and other alchemical masters, and the Ancient Demon Clan's leaders gathered together.

There were nearly ten practitioners just within the Saint Realm.

This was a force capable of sweeping the Tongxuan Continent, not to be underestimated; it was precisely their presence that forged the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's supreme renown across the Tongxuan Continent.

Yang Kai's gaze swept across familiar faces; warmth filled his chest and an utterly radiant smile bloomed on his lips.

After decades apart, old friends remained as they were — nothing could top this news.

"It truly is the Saint Lord!"

"The Saint Lord has returned — he really has returned."

Excited shouts rose from the crowd; each person was elated, their eyes shining with excitement.

"Your subordinate Xu Hui, accompanied by the Sacred Land's elders, pays respects to the Saint Lord and respectfully welcomes the Saint Lord's return to the sect!" Xu Hui, elderly and dignified though overwhelmed with emotion, quickly composed himself and called out.

The gathered elders promptly bowed in salute.

"There's no need for such ceremony — I'm merely home," Yang Kai waved, and an invisible force lifted them all up.

"Master..." From another corner came the choked call of Li Rong, the Ancient Demon Clan's chief.

Another clan leader, Han Fei, stood nearby, her eyes reddened as well.

Yang Kai had inherited the mantle of the Great Demon God; to the Ancient Demon Clan, which had served the Great Demon God for generations, Yang Kai was their exalted lord — a status even the present Demon Lord Changyuan could not match.

Thus, even during Yang Kai's absence, they had remained here waiting.

In truth the Demon Domain was better suited to the Ancient Demon Clan, but for Yang Kai's sake Li Rong had resolutely settled the clan within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Gazing at Yang Kai's face, Li Rong's feelings trembled.

When Yang Kai left years ago she had asked to follow, vowing to protect him to the death, but Yang Kai did not know what the future held and dared not take Li Rong along, so he left her behind.

Yet over these decades, Li Rong had missed him day and night. Whenever she thought of Yang Kai out there, his fate unknown, she could neither eat nor sleep in peace—hating herself for not having stood her ground back then, for letting her Lord wander the world alone.

Her heart had been filled with self-reproach and she had suffered greatly these years.

Now, seeing Yang Kai returned safely, she wept for joy.

"Don't cry — be happy, I'm back," Yang Kai chuckled and comforted her.

"Yes!" Li Rong pressed her red lips and nodded.

She would unconditionally grant Yang Kai's requests.

"Kid, so it's really you back?" At that moment a voice of surprise rang from the side.

Yang Kai turned and saw Meng Wuya.

After decades, Meng Wuya still looked the same: plainly dressed and unassuming. If he had plunged into the crowd, those who did not know him might have thought him a decrepit old man, never imagining that he was a pinnacle expert of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

"Shopkeeper Meng, I hope you've been well!" Yang Kai smiled brightly.

"Good, good — the lad looks well-fed; I am relieved," Meng Wuya nodded heavily, relief plain on his face.

Meng Wuya had essentially watched Yang Kai grow up. At the time he hid his identity and remained within the Lingxiao Pavilion as the manager of the Contribution Hall; he had known Yang Kai since the beginning, and because of Xia Ningshang the two had grown close.

Seeing Yang Kai return after decades, Meng Wuya felt as if a great stone had fallen from his chest.

His concern for Yang Kai was second to none.
