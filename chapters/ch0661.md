## Chapter 661 — It Is Your Honor

Before Yang Kai, who had entered the Enter Demonic State, the beautiful female leader of the Ancient Demon Clan, though like the others unable to muster any power, nevertheless remained calm and composed.

"I'm not an outsider?" Yang Kai pointed at himself, his expression one of astonishment.

Li Rong gave a slight nod. "Allow me to explain the specific reasons later; this is not a place for discussion."

Yang Kai turned his head to survey the surroundings; the volcano's eruption and the lightning raging across the sky seemed even fiercer than before, and in a little while, even the spot where Li Rong and the others stood would likely be affected.

"You're a clever person; you should know that from start to finish I have harbored no ill intent toward you," Li Rong said in a gentle voice. "Now will you lift the Demon God Transformation and let us flee this place first?"

After speaking, her lovely eyes filled with moisture as she gazed at him.

The Ancient Demon Clan members behind Li Rong all looked at Yang Kai with eager, expectant eyes, waiting for his reply.

In truth, their lives were entirely held in Yang Kai's hands; if he uttered a single "no," they would all be doomed.

Fixing his gaze upon the beautiful woman before him, Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then nodded lightly and said, "I trust you."

Li Rong exhaled heavily, her face relaxing, and she smiled faintly. "You will be glad you made this wise decision."

Yang Kai made no reply; he reined in his own sinister power, the Demon Mark that had crawled over his body quickly receded, and that earth-shattering demonic aura vanished just as swiftly.

All the Ancient Demon Clan members regained control of their own strength and bodies.

"Hua Mo, protect him; we leave now!" Li Rong instructed softly, then, swaying, rushed to the unconscious Han Fei and scooped her up; she immediately turned and barked to Chu Jian's followers, "Chu Jian is dead. If you wish to follow him, I will not stop you, but choose that road and the Small Xuan Realm will have no place for you in future. Or you may choose to follow me; if you truly submit, I will not pursue your past deeds."

Chu Jian's followers exchanged glances and then knelt to the ground, shouting in unison, "We are willing to heed Lady Li's command!"

Chu Jian was already dead; there was no point in following him further—survival was the priority.

Li Rong nodded in satisfaction, clutched Han Fei and sped away.

A large group departed in grand fashion, distancing themselves from the volcano.

Hua Mo's expression was complex and tinged with fear as he stood guard at Yang Kai's side, never leaving him.

Half an hour later they had drawn a hundred Li away from the volcano.

Looking back, the sky had turned a fiery red; the aftershocks from the volcanic eruption had reached them and the earth trembled violently.

Every face bore the marks of lingering dread.

After giving Han Fei a simple treatment for her wounds, the group set out for Mo Shen Fort.

Yang Kai spent the journey watching faces, noticing each Ancient Demon Clan member unconsciously kept their distance from him, seemingly fearful; only Li Rong smiled broadly, holding Han Fei in her arms, speaking to Yang Kai in gentle tones about ordinary matters as they traveled.

Much of what she related were accounts from the annals about the Great Demon God—tales that even Hua Mo was not entirely familiar with, let alone the ordinary clan members.

Everyone took them for mere stories and listened with great interest.

A day later Han Fei regained consciousness; although her injuries had not fully healed, she was out of danger.

She had been unconscious at the time Yang Kai entered his demonic state, so she had no idea what had happened afterward. Now, seeing Li Rong holding her, she simply assumed Li Rong had defeated Chu Jian and asked no further, settling herself to rest.

Two days later the group returned to Mo Shen Fort.

Yang Kai once again went to that stone chamber and waited quietly for Li Rong's arrival.

He had many uncertainties he wished the beautiful woman to clarify, and she had said the volcano area was not the place to talk and would explain everything later.

Within Mo Shen Fort all was calm; no one knew that one of the four commanders had already fallen.

Yang Kai was reasonably satisfied with the outcome of this trip; his Dantian had stored a great deal of Yang Liquid, and as long as he did not squander it, he would not have to worry about Yang Liquid for more than a decade.

He had also acquired an unimaginable amount of Crystal Stone—a vast fortune.

What pleased Yang Kai most was the knowledge that his Enter Demonic State could restrain the Ancient Demon Clan.

He had been here for more than a year; during that time Li Rong had treated him well, not imprisoning him like the alchemists before had, her supervision relaxed, and she had even assigned a practitioner at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm to guard him.

But Yang Kai had always felt like he was under house arrest, a feeling that made him uneasy.

Now, however, that feeling had vanished; Yang Kai felt confident enough to stand on equal footing with the Ancient Demon Clan and even make them act according to his wishes.

His inner state shifted, and his whole person relaxed considerably.

The following days passed without incident; Li Rong did not come, but Yang Kai was not impatient—he knew with Chu Jian dead there were many matters for Li Rong to handle, so he continued refining pills and waited calmly.

The stone chamber's door was pushed open and Guan'er burst in, excitement written all over her face as she rushed to Yang Kai and asked anxiously, "Yang Kai, I heard you killed Chu Jian—did you really?"

"Who told you that?" Yang Kai asked.

"Lady Li said so. Is it true?"

"What do you think?" Yang Kai chuckled.

Guan'er blinked, pouted, and said, "I think with your insignificant cultivation you couldn't possibly have killed that man, but since Lady Li says so, it must have been you." Saying this, she grew excited, threw her arms around one of Yang Kai's arms and began to sway, cooing, "Tell me how you killed that bastard—Lady Li has always been troubled by him."

As she swayed, Yang Kai clearly felt his elbow touch something startlingly soft and elastic.

Casting his eyes toward that softness, Guan'er immediately became alert, crossing an arm over her chest and snapping, "You pervert—what are you staring at?"

Yang Kai's face darkened. "That's your own problem, okay?"

Guan'er snorted, "You humans really are no good! I'm going to tell Lady Li you attempted to assault me."

"Don't slander me!" Yang Kai snapped in anger.

Guan'er rolled her eyes and, slyly, "Then be a good boy and tell me honestly how you killed Chu Jian—I want to know."

"Go ask Lady Li yourself," Yang Kai said, his head aching.

"Lady Li has been busy these days caring for Commander Han Fei and recruiting Chu Jian's people; I wouldn't dare disturb her," Guan'er pouted, her rosy lips quite alluring.

"I'm busy as well," Yang Kai said seriously.

Guan'er appraised him from head to toe, snorting, "Fine, I'll go tell Lady Li that you are a lecher with ill intent, coveting my beauty and plotting to make a move!"

"Guan'er, do not be rude!" a light rebuke suddenly sounded in the air.

The air twisted and Li Rong, Han Fei, and Hua Mo appeared as if on cue.

Guan'er suddenly grew flustered and hastily waved her hands, "Lady Li, I was only joking with him—he didn't do anything to me."

She defended Yang Kai in that moment precisely because she feared Li Rong might believe her and punish him.

"I know," Li Rong nodded lightly. "But don't say he hasn't done anything to you—if he truly did do something to you, it would be your honor!"

Guan'er could not help but gape, slowly savoring Lady Li's words in stunned silence.

Though she was only an ordinary clan member, having always been at Li Rong's side had earned her a respectable position within Mo Shen Fort; combined with Guan'er's beauty and decent aptitude, many young men in the fort fancied her—Pan Lang was one such man whom Yang Kai had injured previously.

Yet no matter how those men pleaded, Li Rong never intended to marry Guan'er off; she believed those clan members were unworthy and wanted to find a suitable match for Guan'er, or wait until Guan'er herself had someone she favored.

But now Li Rong had spoken in such a way—how could Guan'er not be stunned?

To be taken advantage of by a human… how could that ever be called an honor?

"Sorry to have kept you waiting these past days; I truly could not leave," Li Rong said, nodding lightly to Yang Kai.

"No matter, I'm fine," Yang Kai responded with a wry smile.

Guan'er frowned; she sensed Li Rong's attitude toward this human was different this time—she could not explain why, but Guan'er felt Li Rong seemed a bit restrained and reverent when facing him.

The sudden thought startled her.

It was not just her; Han Fei and Hua Mo were equally puzzled, their faces filled with doubt.

Even if this human could perform the Demon God Transformation and restrain the Ancient Demon Clan, there was no reason to show him such favor; a human who had secretly learned the Demon God Transformation should have been executed—mercy was already being shown by not doing so.

"Han Fei, Hua Mo, I know you have doubts—just as this Lord does," Li Rong said.

"Lord?" everyone in the room except Li Rong exclaimed in unison, staring blankly at Yang Kai.

"Why are you all looking at me? I'm as bewildered as anyone," Yang Kai said, utterly speechless.

"Now is the time to answer you," Li Rong said with a gentle smile. "Please, sit."

Saying so, she sat cross-legged directly in front of Yang Kai.

Han Fei and Hua Mo exchanged a glance, saw each other's helplessness, and, like Li Rong, sat down beside Yang Kai.

Li Rong regarded Yang Kai with a soft gaze and spoke, "Please let down the defenses of your spirit; we need to enter your Sea of Consciousness."

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. "Enter my Sea of Consciousness?"

"Yes," Li Rong replied, "only there can I explain everything clearly and convince Commanders Han Fei and Hua Mo of the truth of my words."

"Aren't you afraid?" Yang Kai asked, looking at Li Rong with loaded meaning.

Li Rong slowly shook her head. "As long as it bears no malice toward you, it will not harm us—last time I too was left unharmed."

Han Fei and Hua Mo both looked bewildered, not understanding whom "it" referred to.

Yang Kai frowned, pondered for a moment, and said, "You may enter my Sea of Consciousness, but do not rifle through my memories. If anyone dares to do so, do not blame me for being discourteous." To be continued.
