## Chapter 50 — Casting Away the Corpses

Hu Mei’er dared not speak further; too many words might cause trouble. She feared provoking Yang Kai’s anger.

“Come here!” Yang Kai suddenly beckoned to her. Hu Mei’er’s delicate body trembled, tears welled in her eyes, and she bit her lip in silent plea, yet dared not move a step.

“What are you afraid of? If I call you, then come!” Yang Kai’s impatience showed.

Helpless, Hu Mei’er could only walk toward him, stopping five paces away, her eyes filled with terror as she looked at him.

Sensing her fear, Yang Kai found it amusing but still wore a stern expression. “Behave, and I won’t harm you.”

His calm tone carried an irresistible authority.

Hu Mei’er nodded vigorously. “I’ll obey.”

“Good.” Only then was Yang Kai satisfied. He bent down and hoisted the corpse of Nu Tao onto his shoulders, then gestured toward the body of Cheng Shaofeng. “Take him up!”

Though disgusted, Hu Mei’er dared not disobey. She crouched down with a grievance and lifted Cheng Shaofeng’s body. Though a young girl, she was a martial artist; carrying a hundred jin or so was no great burden.

“Follow me.” Yang Kai glanced at the direction and headed deeper into the Black Wind Forest.

Hu Mei’er did not know his intentions and dared not ask, only following closely behind.

Yang Kai intended to dispose of the bodies. Although the previous spot was already deep within the forest, there was no guarantee some amorous couple wouldn’t choose it for a tryst. If anyone saw the corpses, it would be a troublesome matter. Though the chance was slim, caution was necessary.

The deaths of Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao were peculiar—they were both pierced through vital points by scorching primordial energy. If Fengyu Tower investigated along this clue, it might lead back to him.

Therefore, Yang Kai had to cast the bodies far away so that Fengyu Tower’s people would never find them.

The two walked one after another deeper into the dense forest. Hu Mei’er several times wanted to speak but held back.

After more than an hour, a lake suddenly appeared before them. Yang Kai’s eyes brightened. This was the place.

He signaled Hu Mei’er to set down the bodies. Then he searched for two large stones, carried them back, and tied them to the corpses of Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao, sinking them to the lake’s bottom.

Clapping his hands, Yang Kai pondered for a moment. “You’re now my accomplice. You should know what to do, right?”

He turned to look at her calmly.

Upon hearing this, Hu Mei’er was not frightened but rather pleased, nodding repeatedly. “I understand.”

Yang Kai’s words meant he bore no ill will toward her. Her life was safe, and Hu Mei’er’s body and mind relaxed, involuntarily exhaling a breath.

“Smart. A clever girl will always find someone who likes her,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

Before this, Yang Kai truly did not know what to do with Hu Mei’er. Not killing her left a hidden danger; yet killing her was difficult—she had only watched from the sidelines and never harmed him. Would it be too unreasonable to wipe her out for that?

After walking such a long way, Yang Kai came to understand. This matter was initiated by Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao. If he did not kill them, would he just wait to be killed? So even if Hu Mei’er exposed the matter, Yang Kai was not afraid.

“You’ve killed many people?” Hu Mei’er’s courage grew as she looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai shook his head. “This is my first time.”

“But I saw your technique was very skilled. When you killed them, you didn’t even furrow your brow. That doesn’t seem like a first time,” Hu Mei’er questioned.

Her words caused Yang Kai to frown. Indeed, why was he not afraid at all for his first kill? Though there was no excitement, there was absolutely no fear. At the time, he focused only on killing them; now, looking back, it seemed incredible.

“Believe it or not,” Yang Kai said without further explanation.

He circled half around the lake, moving away from the spot where the bodies were cast, then stopped and plunged into the water.

This battle had left many wounds on him; he needed to wash clean before returning.

Hu Mei’er waited by the lake, secretly wanting to enter the water herself. If it had been over an hour ago, she would have dared to tease Yang Kai, but now she lacked the courage.

After Yang Kai finished washing and emerged, Hu Mei’er spoke. “Wait for me a moment. I want to wash up too.” Carrying a corpse for so long had left her feeling uncomfortable.

Women always loved cleanliness.

“Alright.” Yang Kai wrung out his clothes and lay on a rock by the lake to bask in the sun and recover his strength.

Not daring to undress, Hu Mei’er slipped into the lake. Her graceful figure swam like a fish, occasionally stealing glances at Yang Kai, only to find he did not even open his eyes. This struck a blow to her heart.

He’s not moved at all?

After a long while, Hu Mei’er finished washing and came ashore.

Her wet clothes clung tightly, revealing every curve of her enchanting figure without reservation. Blushing, she sat sideways on the rock basking in the sun.

Yang Kai opened his eyes and appraised her from head to toe. Hu Mei’er lowered her head.

“Nice figure,” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Hu Mei’er bit her red lips, her expression troubled. “Actually… I have never done those things with a man. The only one who has touched me is you. These past years, the reason I acted as I did was partly to recruit talents for the gang and partly to sow discord between Lingxiao Pavilion and Fengyu Tower disciples. My entanglement with you was for that purpose.”

Yang Kai was stunned, gazing at her deeply.

“You don’t believe me?” Hu Mei’er’s face flushed. This secret she had never told anyone. Outsiders thought she was a wanton woman, called her the little princess or miss openly, but behind her back, they cursed her as a harlot.

“I believe you!” Yang Kai nodded. “But what does it matter to me?”

Hu Mei’er’s expression darkened, and she smiled bitterly. “I won’t bother you anymore.”

This matter had dealt her a heavy blow.

Hearing this, Yang Kai felt relieved. At last, he had rid himself of this trouble.

After Hu Mei’er’s clothes dried, the two left the lake.

To avoid attracting attention, Yang Kai and Hu Mei’er parted ways early, each returning to their respective sects.

After resting briefly in his wooden hut, Yang Kai rose and went to Dragon Confinement Ravine. The fierce battle had exhausted all his recent hard cultivation. Naturally, he needed to replenish his True Yang Yuan Qi quickly; otherwise, he would be helpless if faced with such a situation again.

Moreover, having used the Yang Fluid twice today, the power it unleashed thrilled Yang Kai. He had never imagined its strength was so great. Now, at the eighth stage of the Body Tempering Realm, if his realm were higher, wouldn’t the Yang Fluid’s power be even stronger? For whatever reason, Yang Kai now felt an urgent desire to cultivate.
