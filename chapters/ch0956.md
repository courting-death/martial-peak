## Chapter 956 — Su Yan's Whereabouts

Yang Kai felt a surge of shock in his heart; if the Bone Clan's account was true, then they were truly outsiders from the starry void.

How utterly unfathomable was that?

There had long been suspicions that within the vast starry sky there might exist other lifeforms.

But because no one could penetrate the starry sky, that idea had never been proven.

Only now did Yang Kai confirm that the predecessors' doubts were not baseless.

The Bone Clan plainly were beings from the starry sky; they were not indigenous to Tongxuan Continent!

"Kid, how much did you see just now?" Ke Luo's cold, sinister eyes stared at Yang Kai as he asked in a deep voice.

"Pretty much everything."

Yang Kai had seen the blood pool's strangeness, the array formations flashing at its bottom, and how bones, combined with medicinal materials and the Bone Clan's life essence, formed skeletons that then, as if reborn, rose from the pool.

Those newly formed Bone Clan were fragile and he destroyed them with a single strike, yet each exuded Transcendent Realm aura; given enough time they could become Transcendent Realm experts—difficult-to-kill ones at that.

"Hmph!" Ke Luo snorted coldly. "Seeing it makes no difference; in any case you're bound to die today!"

Yang Kai grinned. "When I came in you were shouting about dominating the world. Do you really think those Transcendent Realm fighters alone can achieve that?"

Ke Luo looked at Yang Kai with contempt, certain he'd got him; he didn't move but used his Divine Sense to seal the space around Yang Kai so he couldn't use the Star Shuttle to escape, and said lightly, "Transcendent Realm? The sparse resources here only allow our newly formed kin to reach Transcendent Realm strength."

"You can make someone reach Saint Realm?" Yang Kai's face darkened.

Ke Luo laughed. "As long as we kill sufficiently powerful experts, take their flesh and blood, and pair it with high-grade medicinal materials, what's so difficult about entering the Saint Realm?"

Yang Kai's face went ashen.

He had underestimated how strange this race was; he hadn't expected such bizarre beings.

Yet their methods came at a considerable cost.

The bottom of that blood pool held many leftover medicines and bones; no doubt the corpses of the Water Divine Hall's two thousand disciples had been dumped into it, but the Bone Clan born in the end numbered only a few hundred.

"Enough talk—hand over the Star Shuttle. As a reward, you may choose a comfortable death." Ke Luo's impatience showed.

"One last question. Answer it and the Star Shuttle is yours!" Yang Kai's voice dropped low.

"You have no right to bargain with me!" Ke Luo's expression hardened. "With your meager power I can take your life with a snap!"

"Try me. Maybe before I die I can destroy this Star Shuttle!" Yang Kai said calmly, clutching the Star Shuttle's True Yuan with a posture like a fang-edged snake, ready to fight to the death.

Ke Luo's face changed; a trace of hesitation crossed it—Yang Kai's words had hit a nerve.

Star Shuttles were indeed common in the vast starry void; when they came to Tongxuan Continent, their people had many Star Shuttles, but after thousands of years without flesh and blood, they couldn't sustain their Secret Treasures and the Star Shuttles had long since broken and become unusable.

The Star Shuttle in Yang Kai's hand was probably the only one left on the entire Tongxuan Continent.

If they ever wanted to leave Tongxuan Continent and return to the starry void, they would need the Star Shuttle's power.

That's why Ke Luo wanted Yang Kai's Star Shuttle so badly; without it they could never return to where they came from.

"Young man, don't be rash. Let's talk it through!" Ke Luo's expression shifted; a covert cold light flashed in his eyes as he resolved to make Yang Kai suffer the torments of the world once he had the Star Shuttle in hand.

"So can we talk?"

"Speak."

"There was a passage to the starry sky in that glacier-covered world. Tell me—where did the people who originally lived there go?"

"You mean the ones who cultivated the Ice Cold Technique?" Ke Luo's eyes flickered with a ghostly fire.

"Yes. Tell me what became of them!"

"What do you have to do with them?" Ke Luo countered without answering.

"Stop with the nonsense, or I'll destroy the Star Shuttle now so you'll never get it!" Yang Kai barked fiercely.

Ke Luo's face reddened with anger, on the verge of erupting, but he restrained himself and said coldly, "Most of them died; the rest fled!"

"Fled where?"

"To the starry sky!"

"Bullshit!" Yang Kai's face contorted as he snarled, "You think I don't know the starry sky's mysteries? The pressure there is immense; aside from experts of your level, no one can survive there. Don't try to fool me—I have been to the starry sky, more than once!"

Ke Luo couldn't help but look at Yang Kai in surprise; he hadn't expected such audacity and experience from him.

The starry sky wasn't somewhere ordinary people could easily penetrate.

Shrugging, Ke Luo laughed. "You don't have to believe it, but it's true—they really fled to the starry sky, because… they had Star Shuttles too!"

"They had them too?" Yang Kai froze, then realized: the Ice Sect had clashed with the Bone Clan many times before, so capturing a Star Shuttle was plausible.

If they used a Star Shuttle, they could indeed reach the starry sky without worrying about the dangers.

Ke Luo's words were credible!

"How many escaped?" Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

"You agreed to only ask one question." Ke Luo snorted.

"I changed my mind!"

Ke Luo gritted his teeth and glared at Yang Kai, then growled, "Six! Five reached the Saint Realm; one is Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!"

"Six…" Yang Kai murmured, calculating silently, then asked, "How many of them were women?"

"Three; the one in the Transcendent Realm was a woman."

Hearing that, Yang Kai grinned, starting low and then swelling into a roll of thunder as if he'd discovered something amusing; the tension in his face eased, and he looked thoroughly elated.

He could now be certain—the Transcendent Realm cultivator had to be Su Yan! Her cultivation truly was in no way behind his.

Only then did Yang Kai finally relax, exhaling heavily.

"If you're satisfied, give me the Star Shuttle!" Ke Luo reached out again, looking at Yang Kai with grim resolve, clearly ready to snatch it if Yang Kai said another word.

“If I don’t give it to you, what can you do about it?” Yang Kai’s smile faded as he looked down with disdain.

"You'll die! And die horribly!" Ke Luo warned coldly. "Don't think you can use the Star Shuttle to escape—the starry void's warriors have many ways to counter the Star Shuttle's speed; it's merely a Secret Treasure for travel!"

"I wasn't going to use the Star Shuttle!" Yang Kai shook his head and slashed the void with a hand.

In that instant it seemed something in the nether was being cut.

A pitch-black rift suddenly appeared before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai waved to Ke Luo, then dove into the spatial rift and vanished.

"Ripping open the void!" Ke Luo's face changed drastically as a roaring tide of Divine Sense surged toward the rift, attempting to stop Yang Kai's escape.

But the spatial rift closed in an instant, rendering his Divine Sense attack ineffective.

Watching the spot where Yang Kai had disappeared, Ke Luo's expression shifted wildly—what an extraordinary turn!

He hadn't expected such an unremarkable human youth to know techniques for tearing open the void; such methods weren't within the reach of ordinary people.

The void's chaotic currents were even more dangerous than the vast starry sky; one misstep could leave one trapped for life with no way out.

"Lord, should we pursue?" the Bone Clan called, all of them staring at Ke Luo.

"Who even knows where he is? Pursue what!" Ke Luo raged, "Go collect materials! News of our revival can no longer be hidden; prepare early!"

"Yes!" The Bone Clan swarmed out from Shuishen Dao, shooting off in all directions.

A thousand li away, Yang Kai appeared calmly, his face grave.

Though relieved to know Su Yan was safe, the Bone Clan's sudden resurgence worried him; after witnessing their peculiar methods, he felt their tenacity acutely.

They counted dozens of Saint Realm experts and hundreds of Transcendent Realm ones; such a force could not be contained by a single faction.

Most worryingly, they could gather bones and flesh, mix them with medicines, and create new kin.

Given enough power, they could indeed dominate the world.

They were a cancer that had to be crushed early, or the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and his relatives from the Great Han would sooner or later be implicated.

Yang Kai had a vague sense that the Bone Clan's appearance—and many recent events—were tied to the words left by the Great Demon God's Soul Incarnation, and to the secret hidden in the Demon Capital!

Summoning the Flying Shuttle, he sped off, lost in thought.

Passing the valley where Shui Yun and his daughter had been left earlier, Yang Kai went down to check and found, to his surprise, that they were still waiting there.

When they saw Yang Kai return, Shui Ling rushed over anxiously, concern written all over her face: "You're finally back safe—it's been half a month."

Shui Yun's features showed a trace of admiration. "Saint Lord Yang is indeed skillful and daring. Did you gain anything from this trip?"

"Yes, a little." Yang Kai nodded. "Why are you still here?"

"Waiting for you!" Shui Ling answered.

"Then you can leave now—where are you headed? I'll send you." Yang Kai looked at the father and daughter.

Shui Yun's expression was bitter; he replied helplessly, "The Water Divine Hall has been destroyed; we seem to have nowhere to go."

Shui Ling's expression was equally desolate and forlorn, her spirit secretly wounded. The Water Divine Hall was their root, but now it had been fully occupied by the Bone Clan and the two thousand disciples were all slaughtered, none left; even Shuilan City had suffered the same calamity.

In this vast world, there wasn’t really anywhere they longed to go.
