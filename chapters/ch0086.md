## Chapter 86 — Trailing Behind

Among this group led by Nu Lang, he was the undisputed strongest. Having just broken through to the Qi Movement Realm, his primordial qi was restless and turbulent. Warriors at this stage were the most prone to anger, easily swayed by their emotions. The other seven or eight men were mostly at the Body Tempering Realm, with a few at the Open Origin Realm, though none of great strength. Their advantage lay only in numbers.

Nu Lang had naturally heard of Yang Kai’s prowess, so he did not take him seriously. The only one who caught his attention was the woman riding close beside Yang Kai, who seemed not to be someone to trifle with.

But upon further reflection, he thought this woman was probably nothing extraordinary. After all, she appeared quite young, and none of the renowned disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion looked like her.

Moreover, if she truly possessed profound strength, why would she need to buy a horse to ride? Once a cultivator reached a certain level, their own speed on foot far surpassed that of a horse.

With this thought, Nu Lang relaxed.

Little did he know, Xia Ningshang’s reason for buying a horse was solely to take care of Yang Kai. After all, Yang Kai was only at the fourth stage of the Open Origin Realm; how fast could his feet really be?

The disciples from Fengyu Tower quickly prepared and followed the trail of hoofprints as they gave chase.

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang also rode at full speed, unaware that two groups were trailing them from behind, each harboring ill intent.

Though Xia Ningshang’s strength was considerable, she had yet to condense her divine sense, making it impossible to detect disturbances over a wide area.

The two rode on in silence for most of the journey, with Xia Ningshang leading and Yang Kai close behind. Their two swift horses galloped one after the other.

It was not until nightfall that they found a place with a water source to light a fire and rest.

They took out the food purchased in Wumei Town and ate a little before sitting around the campfire to rest.

After a day together, Yang Kai had come to understand this junior sister’s temperament: timid, shy, speaking only a few words before blushing, her voice soft and gentle, seemingly without any temper.

With such a disposition, Yang Kai refrained from initiating conversation, not wanting to startle her.

Since the day he comprehended the secret of the Proud Bone Golden Body and grasped the mysterious martial art ‘Unyielding Will,’ Yang Kai noticed a change in the True Yang Technique.

When operating the True Yang Technique in an environment rich with Yang Qi, he could absorb the yang energy and condense Yang Liquid.

In environments lacking Yang Qi, he could still run the True Yang Technique to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, which was then refined by the True Yang Primordial Qi within his body and absorbed by the Proud Bone Golden Body.

The limitations of cultivation environment vanished instantly. This was tremendous news for Yang Kai.

After three days of relentless travel, the two finally arrived at a small town a thousand li from Lingxiao Pavilion. They stabled their horses and found an inn to stay at temporarily.

According to Xia Ningshang, the journey ahead would no longer require horses, as they would be entering the mountains where horses could not follow.

Late at night, the inn was quiet.

Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang stayed in adjacent rooms, both brightly lit. Yang Kai sat in meditation, cultivating, while Xia Ningshang was lost in thought.

In these three days of companionship, they had exchanged fewer than ten words. Xia Ningshang felt awkward; after all, she had come seeking his help but had been so neglectful of him, which troubled her conscience.

Yet whenever she tried to summon the courage to speak, she found herself unable. Having grown accustomed to observing him from afar, suddenly facing him directly left her unsure of how to act.

Besides, this junior brother seemed taciturn. Would approaching annoy him?

While Xia Ningshang fretted, two other groups quietly watched from within the inn.

In one room, Long Hui sat with a group of elite Blood Battle Gang disciples. The flickering candlelight cast distorted shadows over his face.

Upon receiving news, the Blood Battle Gang had given chase, but having set out late, they only caught up today.

After a moment of silence, Long Hui said, “Chief Wen, when shall we strike? That Yang Kai is staying right here in this inn. With your skill, capturing him should be no trouble.”

Wen Feichen, a middle-aged man at the fifth stage of the True Essence Realm, was a hall chief of the Blood Battle Gang. Because Long Hui’s information was reliable, he had brought experts along to ensure the capture of Xia Ningshang alive.

Besides Wen Feichen, there were six or seven Separation and Union Realm experts in the group. It was clear Long Hui was making a grand show to guarantee success.

Wen Feichen smiled upon hearing this. “Young Master Long, if you wish, I can act now. Though this is a small town, with my strength, dealing with them would be effortless. It would neither disturb others nor leave any trace.”

“Then what are we waiting for?” Long Hui’s expression brightened. “Yang Kai must die, but that woman must be captured alive. They say she is a peerless beauty. Since he dares set his sights on my woman, I’ll return the favor and let him experience the pain of having his woman watched by others.”

Wen Feichen knew Long Hui’s nature well and did not react much, only saying, “But have you considered why they have traveled so far to come here?”

“Why?” Long Hui asked in a low voice.

Wen Feichen pondered briefly before replying, “I believe they have a purpose. Perhaps... they intend to enter Black Wind Mountain to seek some rare treasure or genius artifact.”

Long Hui frowned. “What does that have to do with us? There are plenty of treasures in Black Wind Mountain, but not everyone who enters finds them.”

Wen Feichen shook his head. “Young Master Long, you are mistaken. Lingxiao Pavilion can also enter Black Wind Mountain, yet they rode horses for a thousand li and stopped here. If I’m correct, they will enter the mountain from here tomorrow. Their purpose is clear, so we can be certain they know where to look and will find it. If we follow them quietly, once they find that treasure...”

Wen Feichen’s keen observation and analysis were impressive, befitting a seasoned veteran.

Long Hui’s eyes lit up. “Then we can strike and seize it!”

Wen Feichen smiled. “Exactly. But if Young Master Long is impatient to claim the beauty, I can act tonight and will not disappoint you.”

Long Hui hesitated, his expression wavering.

Wen Feichen tactfully said, “But if you wait a few days, you can have both the beauty and the treasure. Imagine if they endure countless hardships to find the treasure only for us to snatch it away. Yang Kai would surely be furious to the point of coughing blood.”

Hearing this, Long Hui’s hesitation vanished. “Very well. They can live a few more days. We will reap the benefits!”

Wen Feichen chuckled. “To endure what ordinary men cannot, Young Master Long is destined for greatness. I admire you.”

“Ha ha, Chief Wen, you flatter me,” Long Hui replied, thoroughly pleased.
