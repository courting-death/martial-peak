## Chapter 1126 — Saint King Realm

Yang Kai’s terrifying strength filled the members of the Haike Family with boundless fear. He had killed an elder of the Xu Family without hesitation, and the strongest in their Haike Family was only on par with Xu Zhishen. If he were to turn against the Haike Family, who among them could possibly stand in his way?

The only option was to snuff this danger out while it was still in its bud.

Ba Qingyan smiled bitterly and slowly shook his head.

“Elder…” the middle-aged man who’d proposed the idea looked at him confused, not understanding what Ba Qingyan feared. Although Yang Kai’s earlier showing had been shocking, he was at a crucial point in his breakthrough — the best time to strike. Miss this chance and the whole Haike Family would have no way to deal with him.

“Didn’t you see that woman in the black robe laying out a formation beside him just now?” Ba Qingyan snorted coldly.

“What fear is there in a formation?” the middle-aged man dismissed.

Ba Qingyan let out a cold laugh. “Just now, when Xu Zhishen unleashed the Hundred Mountains Painting, the shockwave spread right up to that woman’s front, yet she and Wu Yi, along with Yu Feng, didn’t even flinch. Tell me—how ingenious do you think the formation she set up must be?”

“Ah!” the middle-aged man exclaimed. He’d been focused on Yang Kai and Xu Zhishen’s duel and hadn’t noticed what was happening over at Yang Yan’s side. At Ba Qingyan’s words he glanced toward Yang Yan and the others and his eyes narrowed — indeed, the three stood quite close to the battlefield, yet their clothes looked untouched and pristine, not a speck of dust.

“Could she actually be a formation master as well?” the middle-aged man was stunned. He muttered, “Wasn’t she a Saint-Grade artificer?”

“She’s the artificer our family tried to recruit last time but failed to bring in?” Ba Qingyan suddenly remembered and shouted to the side, “Zhou Fu, were you the one who went to recruit her last time?”

The man named Zhou Fu came over, sweat beading on his forehead, and hurriedly replied, “Yes, Elder. It was indeed I who went to recruit that woman last time, but she refused without the slightest courtesy, so I…”

“So you didn’t bother to try again, and let the family miss such a great opportunity?” Ba Qingyan glared at him maliciously.

Zhou Fu trembled all over and grimaced, “Elder, forgive me. At the time I didn’t know she had that kind of skill — I only thought she was a Saint-Grade artificer. Had I known earlier, I would have…”

“Incompetent!” Ba Qingyan sighed heavily.

A Saint-Grade artificer the Haike Family could disregard — such artificers could be trained by the clan. But someone who could casually set up a formation capable of stopping the impact of the Hundred Mountains Painting could not be ignored.

The Hundred Mountains Painting was an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure. Even if the impact didn’t hit her formation directly, judging by her current state, the formation she set was exceedingly ingenious.

Where on earth had they found Wu Yi? One man of Third Stage of the Saint Realm had slain Xu Zhishen; he was now about to breakthrough, and the other was not only a Saint-Grade artificer but also versed in formations.

Ba Qingyan suddenly felt a twinge of regret, regretting how harsh he’d been toward Wu Yi earlier. He even considered taking back his words and inviting her to rejoin the family.

If Wu Yi returned to the family, perhaps she could bring that man and woman in.

If Ba Qingyan knew that Yang Yan was also an Origin-Grade Artificer, he would probably not hesitate to apologize to Wu Yi himself.

Yang Kai was immersed in that profound sensation. The reason he dared to break through here was that he simply didn’t take the people of the Haike Family seriously. If they had any sense, they would stay far away—but if they dared to disturb him, Yang Kai wouldn’t mind teaching them a lesson, letting them know whom they could afford to provoke and whom they could not.

Yang Yan set up formations beside him, and Yang Kai saw the Haike Family’s restless eagerness, but he remained absorbed in that profound feeling.

His meridians felt as if they were swelling, growing unbearably sore; his body became like a whirling vortex, producing a tremendous pull. The surrounding Spiritual Qi was slowly converging toward him.

Suddenly, with a pang through his meridians, his flesh and blood writhed and Yang Kai stifled a groan, nearly crying out.

But very quickly that pain vanished, replaced by endless delight. In an instant his meridians became thicker and firmer than before, and the gathered Spiritual Qi poured into his body as if requiring no absorption at all.

The winds and clouds suddenly changed. Above Dragon Lair Mountain, Spiritual Qi grew dense and oppressive—unimaginable amounts of it gathered into spirit clouds. The might of heaven and earth took form, pouring down violently upon Yang Kai like bolts of lightning, striking the hundred-zhang area around him until it was riddled with craters and scars.

“Let’s go farther!” Yang Yan’s face went pale and she dashed away, no longer daring to linger; Wu Yi and Yu Feng followed close behind.

Ba Qingyan gaped, horrified and shaken by the frenzied, dreadful scene before him, and secretly grateful he hadn’t ordered his clansmen to rush up and finish matters earlier.

If they had really done so, without that youth even lifting a finger, the heaven-and-earth might produced by his breakthrough alone would have blasted those Haike Family people into dust.

The other clan members’ bodies likewise trembled.

Indeed, the commotion caused by such an ascension was even more shocking than the earlier battle of mismatched ranks.

They had never known that a person’s ascent could cause the world to react in such a way — how could anyone withstand that?

For a time many secretly cursed that Yang Kai would perish during his ascent; compared to such a person, they felt utterly ashamed.

The thunderous noise seemed to split the soul. Dragon Lair Mountain shook and shuddered; every fall of heaven-and-earth might hit like a great hammer on the heart, leaving one breathless and pale.

Just watching was enough to make them feel unbearable pressure, yet the young man in the midst of his breakthrough wore an expression of excitement. He opened his body and mind completely, wildly embracing the Baptism of heaven and earth’s might.

As the heaven-and-earth might descended, his aura grew ever stronger and more ferocious.

He stood like an ancient divine pillar, lofty and proud between heaven and earth, striking awe and making one unable to gaze directly upon him.

As time passed and the divine might struck, the previously obscure sky gradually cleared; but the heavy weight pressing on each person’s heart did not lessen in the least.

Suddenly the heavens brightened. Yang Kai’s aura retracted slightly; his tightly closed eyes opened again, shining with a glittering, excited light.

Saint King Realm!

He had finally reached the Saint King Realm, breaking through the limits of Tongxuan Continent’s highest boundary, matching the height the Great Demon God once reached!

Only at this moment did Yang Kai feel he had completely linked with the Star Domain.

Power churned through his body, far more overwhelming than before. A light clench of his fist seemed to leak explosive force from his hand; if he fought Xu Zhishen now, Yang Kai was sure the old fellow couldn’t harm him in the slightest. He could easily break through the defenses wrapped by those four peaks.

In the distance the Haike Family stared blankly at Dragon Lair Mountain, as if it had been ravaged by tempest; this ascension had left the mountain even more desolate. The Spiritual Qi that had been gathered by the spirit formation had vanished, the mists on the peaks were gone, and even the Spiritual Qi within thirty li of the area had been completely dispelled.

Ba Qingyan’s heart groaned deep within — he no longer dared underestimate Yang Kai in the slightest.

Yang Yan, Wu Yi and Yu Feng rushed over. Yang Yan excitedly offered congratulations; Wu Yi and Yu Feng also congratulated him, though Yang Kai could detect faint worry in the lines between their brows.

After all, the two of them had only recently announced their departure from the Haike Family.

No matter how poorly the family treated them, it was still their family and where they had grown up. They were flesh and blood and deeply sentimental — they couldn’t act as if nothing had happened in such a short time.

“Young friend, congratulations. Today I’ve truly opened my eyes; you are a dragon among men. In days to come your achievements will surely be boundless!” Ba Qingyan led a group over; his voice reached them before his person did.

Yang Kai turned his head and glanced at him indifferently.

Yang Kai held no goodwill toward this old man. It was one thing when he had pressured Wu Yi before—he was, after all, an elder of the Haike Family and had that authority—but afterward, he had repeatedly wanted to make a move against him, even intending to join forces with Xu Zhishen. Even while Yang Kai was in the middle of his breakthrough, the same thought had crossed his mind. Yang Kai had seen all of this clearly. Although the man had restrained his restless intent and ultimately chosen to stand by and watch, that was only because he feared Yang Kai’s strength and didn’t have absolute confidence in being able to kill him.

Had he been confident, he would have struck long ago.

Seeing Yang Kai refuse to pay attention to him, Ba Qingyan’s face turned a little sour and he awkwardly said, “You are also a friend of Wu Yi. If you have time in the future, do visit our Haike Family. We will certainly sweep the mat in welcome.”

“Wu Yi has already left the Haike Family. Why would I go to your house?” Yang Kai shot him a glance.

Ba Qingyan was immediately stumped into silence, forcing a smile as he glanced at Wu Yi. “Wu Yi is young and sometimes speaks rashly. I believe she didn’t mean to say it and truly meant to leave the family — I certainly won’t take it to heart, right, Wu Yi?”

Wu Yi’s expression was sorrowful; she said nothing.

Yu Feng snorted, “Elder Ba didn’t you just say you would make Wu Yi accept the family law and even that you’d personally take action?”

Ba Qingyan looked coldly at Yu Feng!

He could show favor to Yang Kai and indulge Wu Yi, but that didn’t mean he would indulge Yu Feng. Yang Kai ignored him and Wu Yi gave him the cold shoulder; he was already a little angry at being embarrassed, and Yu Feng’s jab only poured salt in the wound. If not for Yang Kai, he would certainly have moved to teach Yu Feng a lesson.

Unexpectedly, Yu Feng — who had always been obsequious before him and behaved like a mouse before a cat in his presence — this time stood up extremely tough and met his gaze without flinching.

This made Ba Qingyan feel humiliated.

After some thought, he said, “Young friend has just broken through a major realm and will need time to stabilize his cultivation. This old man won’t disturb you for now. If there’s ever anything you need from my Haike Family, don’t hesitate to ask. Mm, since Wu Yi and Yu Feng are your friends, they’ll stay here to look after things for you. After all, this place is still part of my Haike Family’s territory. Wu Yi, Yu Feng, make sure you treat this Young friend with proper respect—understood?”
