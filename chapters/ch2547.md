## Chapter 2547 — The Same Person

Two days ago, this Young Lady suddenly found the cave where the Netherworld Sect and the others were hiding, acted imperiously, and ordered Hua Feichen and the others to help her teach someone a lesson.

It was said that person had bullied her harshly.

Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng were both troubled, since this time in the Ancient Land, they were lying in wait to deal with Yang Kai, and had no interest in meddling in other people’s affairs.

If it were anyone else, it would be fine; with the strength and status of Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng, they wouldn’t need to pay attention. But this Young Lady was different—her background was immense. Even the Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect had to treat her with respect. Whatever she said, how could Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng dare not obey?

The two cursed the person who bullied this Young Lady in their hearts. If not for that fool causing trouble, none of this would have happened. Helping with a small matter was no big deal, but if they alerted Yang Kai and made him wary, that would be bad.

Annoyed as they were, they still had to follow the Young Lady’s orders.

Just as they were about to grit their teeth and accept it, a gust of wind suddenly arrived.

The group had been hiding in this cave for two days without leaving.

Yin Lesheng was secretly pleased and smiled, “Miss Lin’er, it seems... we need to deal with the same person.”

“The same person?” Lin’er looked stunned, and even Elder Fu’s eyes widened, “Such a coincidence?”

Yin Lesheng slowly stood up and said, “This person is named Yang Kai. I have some grudges with him, and the reason I came to the Ancient Land this time is precisely to deal with him!”

Elder Fu’s expression turned odd as he said, “So many people mobilized for one person, even preparing the Heaven Net Sealing Grand Array. Isn’t the Netherworld Sect giving him too much face?”

Yin Lesheng’s face grew serious, “Elder Fu, don’t underestimate this man. I don’t know if you’ve ever fought him, but his strength is far from simple.”

Elder Fu’s face reddened and he nodded, “That’s true.”

Remembering the confrontation with Yang Kai in Desolate City, Elder Fu knew Yin Lesheng wasn’t exaggerating. That young man clearly had the same cultivation as himself, both at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, yet he could suppress Elder Fu so much that he couldn’t even think of fighting back.

If not for that, why would he need help from the Netherworld Sect? He himself was an Emperor, rarely unable to handle things.

“Aside from his own strength, he’s also skilled in a very rare power. That’s what I care about most. Otherwise, there’d be no need for the Heaven Net Sealing Grand Array.” Yin Lesheng snorted, jealousy flashing across his face.

“What power?” Elder Fu asked in shock.

“Power of Space!”

“Hiss...” Elder Fu sucked in a breath, his shock impossible to hide. He blurted out, “Did you say... Power of Space?”

“Exactly.” Yin Lesheng’s face was gloomy. He nodded slightly, “And his mastery of the Power of Space is already very deep. He seems able to tear space at will.”

“Is that so?” Elder Fu was greatly alarmed, his eyes flickering with suspicion. “Could it be... this person is a disciple of that one on the Spirit Beast Island?”

Though he didn’t name names, both Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng knew exactly who he meant.

If Yang Kai really was that person’s disciple, it would be troublesome. That person was said to be the strongest below the Ten Great Emperors in the Star Realm, and he lived on Spirit Beast Island. He was one of the Beast Great Emperor’s people, highly valued by him.

Who would dare touch his disciple? To do so would be to provoke the Spirit Beast Island itself. Even Elder Fu and Lin’er couldn’t bear the consequences.

So Elder Fu couldn’t help but feel uneasy, wondering if he’d provoked someone he shouldn’t have.

Yin Lesheng shook his head, “As far as I know, this brat has no connection with that lord. Elder Fu, you can rest easy.”

“How do you know?” Elder Fu asked cautiously. As Lin’er’s personal guard, he was naturally very careful.

Yin Lesheng smiled slightly, “Because this man comes from the Southern Territory!”

“Southern Territory...” Elder Fu relaxed at that, “If that’s so, then he has nothing to do with that person.” After a pause, he realized, “So your Heaven Net Sealing Grand Array is meant to seal space!”

Yin Lesheng grinned viciously, “Of course. Without his space abilities, I want to see what waves he can stir up.”

Hua Feichen suddenly interjected, “Has that brat already advanced to the Emperor Realm?”

That Yao-named disciple under him was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, yet was killed by Yang Kai with a single palm. Even Elder Fu and Lin’er had suffered at Yang Kai’s hands. All this proved Yang Kai was already an Emperor, otherwise how could he do such things?

“That’s right. What realm did you think he was?” Elder Fu looked at him strangely.

Hua Feichen frowned, “Junior Nephew said that back in the Shattered Star Sea, he was still at the Dao Origin Realm. I didn’t expect...”

Yin Lesheng smiled faintly and said, “That man’s talent is extraordinary, and his luck is heaven-defying. It’s not surprising he found an opportunity in the Shattered Star Sea and advanced to the Emperor Realm. Wasn't I the same? If he wasn’t at the Emperor Realm, I wouldn’t have needed to trouble Senior Uncle Hua and all the other brothers to help me deal with him.”

He looked unsurprised, as if he’d expected this all along.

“Shattered Star Sea... he’s been to the Shattered Star Sea?” Elder Fu was shocked, “Doesn’t that mean he only recently advanced to the Emperor Realm?”

A young man who’d just advanced to the Emperor Realm, whose cultivation might not even be stable and whose Emperor Yuan hadn’t fully transformed, could still completely suppress him. It made Elder Fu feel it was all unreal.

Had he grown old?

“Elder Fu, don’t be surprised. No matter what luck he’s had or how strong he is, this time he’s doomed!” Yin Lesheng said darkly.

“What are you all muttering about?” Lin’er, having listened for a while, impatiently urged, “I want you to catch that guy and hand him over to me. Why are you still dawdling?”

Yin Lesheng turned and smiled, “Miss Lin’er, don’t worry. To deal with him, we need some tricks. But rest assured, within three to five days, I’ll deliver him to you, and you can handle him however you like!”

Lin’er snorted, “That’s best. When the time comes, I’ll strip him naked and throw him where the most people are, so everyone can laugh at him!”

She looked fierce, her face full of satisfaction, as if this was the greatest punishment for Yang Kai.

She’d threatened Zhang Ruoxi with these same words before, just like now.

Yin Lesheng and the others broke out in cold sweat at her words.

Hua Feichen said, “Since Junior Nephew Yao is dead, we can’t stay here. That person may have learned something and might not come here to walk into our trap. We need to move and set up elsewhere.”

Yin Lesheng nodded, “Senior Uncle, you decide.”

After a brief discussion, the two led the other Netherworld Sect disciples away, with Elder Fu and Lin’er following closely behind.

…

“Old Ban, about how much farther is it?”

Shrouded in strange mist, Old Ban led the way ahead, Zhang Ruoxi in the middle, and Yang Kai brought up the rear. Occasionally, a few reckless Yin-Souls attacked, but were easily dealt with.

After walking for most of the day, Yang Kai suddenly spoke up.

Old Ban’s voice drifted from ahead, “We’re not even halfway through yet. If you want to make it out of this passage, it’ll take at least another two days.”

“Two days...” Yang Kai pondered, then said, “Old Ban, you saw what happened earlier. I have some enemies waiting for me up ahead. They’re strong and have numbers. You should head back the way we came. I’ll finish the rest alone.”

Old Ban chuckled, “I’ve heard of the Netherworld Sect, and I can’t afford to provoke them. But in this Ancient Land passage, I’m confident I can come and go as I please. No need to worry about me. Since I promised to lead you out, I won’t quit halfway. My reputation may not be worth much, but it’s not something just anyone can ruin.”

He knew Yang Kai made the suggestion out of concern for him, but in this passage he wasn’t afraid of others. If he couldn’t win, he’d just hide in the strange mist—even someone at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm might not find him.

His familiarity with this place was his greatest advantage.

After a pause, he continued, “Don’t worry, Young Master. Even if they want to ambush you, they won’t do it in a place like this. In my opinion, the exit is the best spot for an ambush. As long as I leave before then, it’ll be fine.”

He made sense. Even if the Netherworld Sect had some scheme, they couldn’t carry it out in the mist-filled passage, so this stretch should be safe.

Thinking this, Yang Kai didn’t insist and nodded, “Thank you, Old Ban.”

The three continued on in silence.

The journey was uneventful. The most dangerous thunder tides and howling wind gusts had already passed. According to Old Ban, for the next month, the Ancient Land passage would be relatively safe. They just needed to watch out for surprise attacks from Yin-Souls.

Yang Kai had worried that the Ghost King wouldn’t let things go, since so many Yin-Soul ghosts had been lost at the cave. But after half a day, he realized he’d been overthinking it.

Maybe the Ghost King knew that even if he acted personally, he couldn’t do anything to Yang Kai, so he simply stayed away and didn’t provoke him again.

As for the Yin-Soul ghosts that were killed... the Ancient Land passage never lacked them. Some die, some are replaced—it’s always replenished.

Old Ban’s route remained winding and unpredictable. With the Gui Jia Bead guiding them, the three never got separated, always staying within three steps of each other.
