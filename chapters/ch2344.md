## Chapter 2344 — Massacre

“Boy, you are proficient in Spatial Force, so this Lord truly has no confidence in keeping you here.” Qiu Ze looked at Yang Kai with a gloomy expression. During their earlier exchange, he had already realized that Yang Kai’s strength was in no way inferior to his own—he might even be a bit stronger. Coupled with his mastery of spatial power, Qiu Ze really had no way to guarantee he could keep him here.

In other words, if Yang Kai wanted to leave, he could do so at any time, and Qiu Ze could only watch helplessly, no matter how unwilling he was.

But in reality, Yang Kai hadn’t left, because he still had many friends here. It was impossible for him to escape alone. So Qiu Ze wasn’t flustered, only sneering as he said, “If you want to go, this Lord won’t stop you. But these people... hmph hmph..."

He didn’t say much, but the threat in his words was obvious.

“Qiu Ze, you old dog, you really are shameless!” Ye Hen roared in anger.

Qiu Ze remained unmoved, only looking at Yang Kai and saying, “Boy, think it over carefully. Will you run away alone, or stay here and share their fate?”

Though he asked this, he was truly afraid Yang Kai would abandon everyone and escape by himself. If that happened, he would have to live in constant fear from then on. Yang Kai was already so powerful at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—if he advanced to the Emperor Realm, how could Tianzhao Palace possibly resist him?

An enemy like this—either don’t provoke him, or cut him down at the root. Otherwise, he would become a source of endless trouble.

Qiu Ze was gambling—gambling that Yang Kai wouldn’t abandon these people. And he was quite confident Yang Kai wouldn’t run away alone. As long as he didn’t, everything could be handled. With so many experts gathered under his command, could they not kill him? Even if it cost something today, Yang Kai had to die here.

Ruan Hongbo and the others were clearly thinking the same thing as Qiu Ze. Though their faces were ugly, none of them retreated. They stared at Yang Kai, murderous intent surging.

Yang Kai stood atop the Formation Foundation platform, sweeping his gaze around as if to memorize the faces of everyone making things difficult for him. Every martial artist his eyes landed on turned pale and quickly averted their gaze, terrified.

“Very well. You forced me to this—don’t regret it!” Yang Kai grinned savagely. Suddenly, a bracelet-shaped Secret Treasure appeared in his hand. Intense energy fluctuations surged from the bracelet, but more importantly, as soon as it appeared, a clear Imperial Aura and Emperor Intent spread out from it.

“Imperial Treasure!” Qiu Ze’s eyes narrowed, a burning light in his gaze.

The others were all in disbelief, their eyes wide open.

The Myriad Sword in Yang Kai’s hand was definitely an Imperial Treasure—they had already experienced its power. For a Dao Origin Realm cultivator to possess one Imperial Treasure was shocking enough, but he actually had another.

Just what is this boy’s background? How does he have so many Imperial Treasures?

Qiu Ze was both terrified and envious. He had finally advanced to the Emperor Realm, yet had no Imperial Treasure to use. Yang Kai, a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, could just pull out two at once—how could he not be jealous?

At this moment, Qiu Ze didn’t even care to guess what great force might be behind Yang Kai. He just wanted to kill him and seize those two Imperial Treasures. With his current cultivation, if he had those two treasures, his strength would skyrocket.

“Attack!” Qiu Ze shouted angrily, charging at Yang Kai first.

Seeing this, the others didn’t dare hesitate and followed suit.

Ye Hen and the others’ faces changed dramatically, all looking ashen. They felt there was no escape this time. Even Hua Qingsi’s beautiful face was grave. But since Yang Kai hadn’t let them retreat into the secret realm, Hua Qingsi knew he must have a plan, so she fixed her gaze on him, wanting to see what trump card he would play to withstand so many experts’ attacks.

Yang Kai slapped the bracelet in his hand, and suddenly, a swarm of black insects surged out from within. A constant buzzing filled the air, as if an invisible opening had appeared on the bracelet, releasing countless black creatures. In the blink of an eye, the Formation Foundation platform was shrouded in black, sealed tight.

“Bugs?” Hua Qingsi cried out, finally seeing what those black things were.

They were tiny black insects, each about the size of a grain of rice, countless in number, forming a cloud that surrounded them. Hua Qingsi could clearly sense an unsettling aura from these bugs.

This aura was very similar to that of the Ancient Giant Demon they had encountered outside Fenglin City.

This realization startled Hua Qingsi. She immediately knew these bugs were strange. No matter what they were, if they possessed the aura of ancient demonic energy, they were definitely not to be trifled with.

The insect cloud appeared, buzzing as it formed an impenetrable wall around the Formation Foundation platform. Qiu Ze and the others attacked together, bombarding the insect cloud with various Secret Techniques and Secret Treasures, sending countless black bugs tumbling to the ground.

Qiu Ze’s tense expression eased. He had been wary of Yang Kai unleashing some terrifying move, but seeing these strange bugs were so easily dealt with, he felt relieved, thinking Yang Kai must be out of tricks.

Qiu Ze was overjoyed and was about to unleash another powerful attack to break through the insect cloud’s defense when he instinctively sensed something was wrong.

He quickly looked down at the bugs on the ground, only to see that every black bug knocked down was completely unharmed. With a slight shake of their wings, they revived, and, as if provoked, began to emit a violent, ferocious aura, swarming toward the nearby martial artists.

What the hell are these things? Qiu Ze’s heart skipped a beat. Before he could figure it out, a pitch-black bug landed on him. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his Sea of Consciousness, as if something had stabbed it. In that instant, he was horrified to find a portion of his Divine Sense missing.

Could these black bugs devour Divine Sense? Qiu Ze was scared out of his wits, breaking out in a cold sweat.

He saw clearly that the bug had landed on his arm, separated by several layers of clothing. Even if it bit him, it should only have bitten his arm—so why did his arm not hurt, yet a portion of his Divine Sense was gone?

As he hesitated, his Sea of Consciousness throbbed again, and more of his Divine Sense was lost.

These black bugs were truly strange!

Qiu Ze dared not be careless. At this rate, if he did nothing, wouldn’t his Divine Sense be completely devoured by these bugs? He was terrified and shook his Origin Qi, unleashing his Emperor Domain to blast the bug away.

To his disbelief, even after that, the black bug wasn’t dead. Instead, it relentlessly tried to attack him again, but was blocked by his Emperor Domain and couldn’t get any closer.

“Ah!”

A miserable scream tore through the sky, followed by countless more, one after another. The cries were so shrill, it was as if they were enduring the cruelest torture in the world.

Qiu Ze turned his head, and his heart felt as if it had been doused in cold water, instantly freezing.

He saw that the martial artists from several great sects, including his own Tianzhao Palace, were all surrounded by the black bugs. The Third and Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators were faring a bit better, their strength allowing them to hold on for now, though they were in a sorry state. But the First Stage Dao Origin Realm and Void King Realm cultivators were doomed. When the black bugs swarmed them, they couldn’t escape at all. Many were instantly covered, disappearing from sight.

In the blink of an eye, those martial artists enveloped by the black bugs fell silent. When the bugs dispersed, each one lay motionless on the ground.

Their bodies were completely unharmed, but their scattered, terrified eyes showed that they had experienced something horrifying before death.

Qiu Ze now understood that these martial artists had all died because the black bugs devoured their Divine Sense. He himself had suffered such an attack—if he weren’t strong enough, he’d be lying on the ground too.

Martial artists fell in droves, struggling and writhing, but none could escape death.

In just five breaths, more than half the martial artists from the great sects were dead!

This was simply a massacre—a one-sided, inhuman slaughter.

Not only were Ruan Hongbo and the others chilled to the bone—even Yang Kai, who started it all, looked horrified at the sight.

Since completely subduing the Soul-Devouring Worms, this was his first time using them in battle. He knew they could be useful, but never imagined that, in such numbers, they would be so powerful.

The scene before him left him stunned. Soul-Devouring Worms continued to pour out of the Slave-Insect Bracelet.

By the time the last Soul-Devouring Worm left the Slave-Insect Bracelet, there were well over a million in the valley. Clusters of black insect clouds surrounded the martial artists still suffering, waiting for a chance to take another bite.

No matter what kind of defensive Secret Treasure the martial artists used, they couldn’t stop the Soul-Devouring Worms’ attacks. The worms even found the Origin Qi within the martial artists’ bodies to be a delicious treat, devouring it without hesitation.

More and more martial artists fell dead to the ground.

The Void King Realm and First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators had long since been wiped out. Under the assault of the Soul-Devouring Worm clouds, the weaker ones had no power to fight back.

Gradually, even the Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators couldn’t hold on. Their Origin Qi and Divine Sense were devoured bite by bite by the Soul-Devouring Worms. Though their bodies were unharmed, they still couldn’t escape death.

No matter how hard they tried, they couldn’t kill even a single Soul-Devouring Worm. The evolved worms seemed incredibly tenacious—occasionally knocked out, they would soon revive and rejoin the fight.

Ye Hen and the others were dumbfounded.

Hua Qingsi and her group were also stunned.

Each of them stood on the Formation Foundation platform, gazing at this inhuman, ruthless slaughter with complicated feelings. These people had been so arrogant just moments ago, but in the blink of an eye, they had become cold corpses. How could something as fickle as the Heavenly Dao be enough to describe it?
