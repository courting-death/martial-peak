## Chapter 2405 — A Hair’s Breadth Away

It was only after three full days that Bing Yun finally awoke. The moment she regained consciousness, she had Fan Xin summon Yang Kai to speak with her.

Inside the side room, after knocking, Yang Kai pushed open the door and entered. Bing Yun was sitting cross-legged on the bed, her face still pale and her aura weak. After three days of healing and recuperation, she was much better, but it was clear she would need more time to fully recover.

Seeing Yang Kai, she forced a faint smile and beckoned, “Come here!”

Yang Kai walked to the bedside and asked with concern, “Senior, how is your body?”

Bing Yun replied weakly, “It’s nothing serious, I just need to recuperate slowly. I truly have to thank you this time.”

If Yang Kai hadn’t arrived at that critical moment, she really might have ended up as food for the sea beasts. That was absolutely not the way she wanted to die. For an expert like her, she would rather fall in battle against another master than be swallowed whole by a creature of the sea.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I didn’t do much. Senior, your safe return is entirely thanks to your own strength.” He paused, then asked nervously, “Chi Ri—did he live or die?”

Bing Yun said flatly, “He’s dead!”

As expected, although Yang Kai had already guessed Chi Ri’s fate wouldn’t be good, hearing Bing Yun confirm his death still brought him relief. With Chi Ri dead, no one would try to stop them from leaving this Jixu Secret Realm. The only dangers left were the hidden threats in this vast sea—if they could get through safely, they would reach the exit.

“We were able to win this battle thanks to the Emperor Yuan Pill you refined.” Bing Yun looked at Yang Kai with gratitude. “Chi Ri’s true strength was on par with mine. If not for the Emperor Yuan Pill you made to restore my power, I wouldn’t have been able to cut him down at the last moment. So I really must thank you.”

She thanked him again, clearly from the bottom of her heart.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected that the deciding factor in the battle would be the Emperor Yuan Pill he’d prepared for Bing Yun just in case. At the time, he’d refined it only as a precaution, but now it was clear that it had been a wise move. Without that pill, Bing Yun might not have made it back at all. Even if she had managed to kill Chi Ri, she herself would likely have been dragged down with him.

“For the time being, I can’t use my strength, or I might leave behind hidden injuries. So for the rest of the journey, you’ll have to be extra careful. Unless it’s absolutely necessary, I won’t be able to help you.” Bing Yun said seriously.

Yang Kai nodded. “Senior, focus on healing. I’ll make sure to get everyone out.”

A trace of comfort appeared on Bing Yun’s pale, beautiful face. “You’re very reliable. Then I’ll wait for your good news.”

Since Bing Yun still needed to heal, Yang Kai didn’t stay long. After chatting for a while, he took the initiative to leave.

Two days later, when the spectacle of waterspouts appeared on the sea’s surface, Yang Kai finally summoned the Bihai Shuttle and transferred everyone into it.

To leave this Jixu Secret Realm, the Bihai Shuttle was absolutely essential—only with it could they reach the exit.

The Bihai Shuttle had been completely refined by Yang Kai, and he was thoroughly familiar with all its control restrictions and formations. So piloting it was no trouble at all.

Unlike the multi-deck ship, the Bihai Shuttle traveled beneath the sea. Because it moved underwater, it could avoid the omnipresent and terrifyingly powerful waterspouts on the surface.

The Bihai Shuttle was by no means slow—its speed was even a bit faster than Yang Kai’s previous multi-deck ship.

Sangde’s unknown master had put great care into crafting the Bihai Shuttle, inscribing countless practical yet simple formations. So even underwater, thanks to the reflection of certain formations, everyone inside could clearly see the surrounding scenery and wonders. It was just that the light was dim, so they couldn’t see very far.

The colorful schools of fish and the darting sea beasts kept everyone on the ship fascinated for days. Even Ling Yinqin and the others, who had spent years at sea, had never seen the underwater scenery before. Now that they saw it, they were naturally delighted.

The journey was smooth, with barely a bump along the way. Occasionally, a sea beast would come prowling for trouble, only to be blasted senseless by the Crystal Stone Cannons mounted on the Bihai Shuttle. The cannons packed a tremendous punch, though each shot burned through ten thousand middle-grade Source Crystals. Fortunately, Yang Kai had no shortage of Source Crystals, so Jiao Yi, who was in charge of the cannons, fired away with abandon. Any sea beast daring to approach was sent tumbling, and those with weaker cultivation were instantly reduced to bloody mist, leaving not a trace behind. Even the stronger ones could only flee in panic, never daring to come close to the Bihai Shuttle.

The smooth voyage put everyone in a good mood.

They had been traveling underwater for a month, and no one knew how far they’d gone. But even now, they still hadn’t reached the exit, which made everyone anxious and uneasy.

One day, as Yang Kai was adjusting their course, he suddenly heard a cracking sound. Startled, he immediately released his Divine Sense to investigate.

Beside him, Ling Yinqin’s face changed dramatically. She hurriedly asked, “Senior Brother Yang, is our Bihai Shuttle… cracking? I heard something!”

Yang Kai’s face was grim. “It’s cracking.”

Ling Yinqin was shocked. “What should we do? If the Bihai Shuttle is destroyed, we’ll have nowhere to run!”

They were in the depths of the sea. If the Bihai Shuttle was destroyed, they might not even make it to the surface. Even if they were lucky enough to reach the surface, the omnipresent, terrifying waterspouts would become their graves. Even Third Stage of the Emperor Realm experts couldn’t overcome those barriers—how could Dao Origin Realm cultivators hope to survive?

“Don’t worry, it can hold on a bit longer.” Although Yang Kai tried to reassure Ling Yinqin, he himself was uncertain. After all, he hadn’t made the Bihai Shuttle and didn’t know how long it could last.

“How far are we from the exit?” Ling Yinqin asked.

“I’m not sure, but it shouldn’t be far.” Yang Kai pointed at the formation projections around them. “Did you notice? Since yesterday, there have been fewer and fewer sea beasts. I haven’t seen a single one in the past hour. Also… the pressure here is increasing, and there’s an unusual current, as if everything is converging in one direction. As long as we follow the current, we should reach the exit.”

Ling Yinqin looked at him and asked, “Are you confident?”

“Seventy percent!” Yang Kai said seriously.

Ling Yinqin nodded lightly and said no more. She knew that since they’d come this far, words were useless. All they could do now was pray that the Bihai Shuttle wouldn’t break before they reached the exit.

The others overheard their conversation and immediately grasped the gravity of the situation. A heavy tension settled over the Bihai Shuttle, everyone’s faces tight with worry as they silently prayed for a safe passage.

Yang Kai steered the Bihai Shuttle, following the current forward.

Half a day later, another crisp cracking sound came from somewhere inside the shuttle, making everyone even more anxious.

As the Bihai Shuttle pressed on, the currents around them grew fiercer and the pressure increased. The cracking sounds became constant.

Yang Kai kept his mind tightly linked to the Bihai Shuttle, feeling its damage mounting with every passing moment. At best, it could hold together for another half a day before falling apart completely. He couldn’t help but curse Sangde’s old master, blaming him for his careless craftsmanship—how could he forge such a shoddy treasure? If only he’d put in more effort, they wouldn’t be in this mess now.

But they’d come this far—there was no turning back. Yang Kai could only focus all his attention on driving the Bihai Shuttle forward at full speed.

After another half day, as Yang Kai was closely monitoring their surroundings, his expression suddenly brightened. Staring at one of the formation projections, he exclaimed, “We’re here!”

At his shout, everyone looked toward the projection. There, deep in the sea, a massive vortex was spinning wildly. Its ferocity seemed capable of devouring the heavens and earth. Just looking at it made one feel suffocated—if they really charged in, who knew if they’d survive?

“Senior Brother Yang, is… is that the exit?” Ling Yinqin’s face turned pale as she swallowed nervously.

Yang Kai didn’t answer, instead turning his gaze to Bing Yun, who had hurried over.

Bing Yun nodded. “That’s the exit. If we rush in, we can leave the Jixu Secret Realm.”

Her confident words dispelled everyone’s doubts. Though no one knew how she’d learned about the exit, Bing Yun was a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert—she wouldn’t lie about something like this.

“I can also sense the spatial power fluctuations inside the vortex,” Yang Kai added.

Yang Kai was well-versed in the mysteries of spatial force, so he could sense things others could not. Within the heart of that massive vortex, he could feel a connection to another realm—his Divine Sense couldn’t pierce through to see what lay beyond.

“The place this exit leads to is random. When we go out, we might end up anywhere in the Star Realm. There could be danger, so everyone be careful,” Bing Yun warned.

“Understood.” Liu Qianyun and the others all nodded solemnly.

Crack, crack, crack…

At that moment, a series of crisp sounds suddenly came from all directions, dense and unending.

Everyone’s faces changed dramatically at the sound.

Yang Kai cried out, “Not good, the Bihai Shuttle is about to collapse!”

As he spoke, he poured all his strength into controlling the Bihai Shuttle, charging straight into the vortex.

The moment they entered, the Bihai Shuttle was caught by a tremendous force and spun around. The Secret Treasure that Sangde’s master had spent his life forging was instantly shattered, and Yang Kai’s mental connection to it was abruptly severed.

Cries of alarm rang out as Fan Xin and the others turned pale with fright, thinking all was lost and they would die here.

At the critical moment, a mighty force suddenly radiated out, emanating an invisible power that enveloped everyone, shielding them from the crushing force coming from all sides.

Yang Kai turned to look and saw Bing Yun, her expression solemn, mobilizing the Emperor Yuan within her delicate body to protect everyone. With a flicker of motion, she led them straight into the heart of the vortex.
