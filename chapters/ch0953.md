## Chapter 953 — Breaking Bones

This strange race could not only draw the flesh-and-blood essences of the dead to shape their own bodies, but even fatal wounds like that meant nothing to them.

They were practically unkillable, and the thought of that sent a chill through Yang Kai.

That strike also seemed to have thoroughly enraged the creature; the Bone Race member bared its maw and howled, and a blood-red light that stained the sky suddenly condensed into a vast net that descended over Yang Kai's head.

The blood-net carried a heart-stopping power and gave off a sizzling sound as it exuded an extremely corrosive force.

Yang Kai let out a muffled grunt as countless pores across his body opened; his True Yang Yuan Qi burst forth like a volcanic eruption. In an instant he became like a blazing sun, golden radiance flooding Shuilan City in a blinding glare.

The blood-net fell toward his head, but before it could touch him it evaporated cleanly.

The Bone Race member on the other side visibly flinched. Before it could recover, Yang Kai had already closed the distance, pressing himself tight against it, a Profound Heaven Sword formed from True Yuan flashing in his hand.

A string of resentful, furious howls issued from the Bone Race creature as the thin strips of flesh clinging to its bones were sliced away; bright red blood streamed from within the exposed bones, the sight pitiful and miserable.

Yang Kai's face remained expressionless as he savaged the creature before him, silently measuring its strength.

He did indeed radiate the aura of a First Stage of the Saint Realm, but he seemed unable to unleash his full power, and as the flesh was stripped away his violent aura gradually weakened.

After a moment, Yang Kai withdrew and fixed his gaze on the creature.

It had been reduced to a skeletal form; apart from the bones only meridians remained, tightly affixed to the skeleton—grotesquely strange.

To Yang Kai's alarm, after enduring so many attacks the creature's bones had not a single scratch.

Its bones seemed even superior to the strongest secret treasures.

The removal of flesh had not affected its life. The creature's body once again radiated an immense attractive force; in an instant Yang Kai felt his qi and blood surge, his blood threatening to burst from his body and his skin beginning to crack.

His expression changed drastically as he hurriedly circulated his True Yuan to resist the pull coming from the Bone Race member's body.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

From all directions, the flesh-and-blood essences of countless slain cultivators condensed into visible streams of energy, pouring into that skeleton.

In no time another thin layer of flesh appeared around the Bone Race creature's body, feeding its violent momentum.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed.

He suddenly felt that his previous suspicions at Tianxiao Sect might have been correct.

For this bizarre race, flesh was not essential—their bones were their true essence. As long as their bones remained intact, they would never truly die.

No wonder Qing Ya had insisted he burn the Bone Race member's remains!

Only by doing so could they be utterly destroyed.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened as he felt he had seen through the nature of this species.

The Profound Heaven Sword in his hand dissolved into motes of light and vanished. Yang Kai pressed his palms together, slapped sharply, then thrust them forward with brutal force.

Beast Soul Seal!

Accompanied by tiger-roars and ox-bells, the White Tiger and the Divine Ox burst forth into existence.

"Tear it apart!" Yang Kai roared as the two beast-souls condensed from his True Yuan lunged at the Bone Race creature with savage ferocity, Yang Kai right behind them.

One man and two beasts launched the simplest, most direct and brutal assault.

The Earth-Splitting Divine Ox charged in, its singular horn on the brow piercing through the Bone Race member's abdomen and lifting it high. The force of the impact made the ghost-fire in its eye flicker—an impact it seemed unable to withstand.

The Heaven-Shaking White Tiger seized the opportunity, leapt up, and clamped its bloodstained maw around one of the Bone Race creature's arms, refusing to let go even as it was savagely beaten.

Yang Kai leaped out and stood upon the White Tiger's back, face cold as he gripped the Bone Race creature's other arm.

Sizzle...

Scorching True Yuan burned the blood and flesh on the bones, releasing a nauseating stench.

Yang Kai paid it no mind, coldly looking down as he heaved and tore.

A violent aura burst from the Bone Race member's body, revealing its panic as it thrashed wildly, trying to shake off the beast-souls' restraints.

The beast-souls condensed from Yang Kai's True Yuan could not withstand its aura; in the blink of an eye they dimmed considerably and were on the verge of collapse.

Unhurried, Yang Kai freed one hand and unleashed the Nether Heaven Lock.

A golden rope bound the Bone Race creature, instantly rendering it unable to move.

Its two ghostly eyes leapt wildly, betraying its unease. Thick, substantial blood-qi surged from the bones and congealed into grotesque, green-faced, fanged fiends that tore at Yang Kai.

"Vast Heaven Shield!"

A shield-like barrier formed, blocking the fiends' assault.

Yang Kai increased the force on his pull.

Crack—

With a series of crisp snaps, one of the Bone Race's arms stretched and was torn away.

Blazing True Yuan burst from Yang Kai's hand; the severed limb was incinerated to ash in an instant.

A bellow tore from the Bone Race creature. Thick blood and life essence flowed from the broken meridian at the severed arm, leaving it instantly enfeebled.

Yang Kai clenched his fist and hammered into its chest, each blow pounding like a ten-thousand-pound mallet as he relentlessly battered its bony form.

Crack—crack—

The bones of its chest fractured and splintered. The Heaven-Shaking White Tiger tore savagely, snapping meridians and prying bones loose one by one.

After a short while the ghost-fire in its eye finally dimmed and went out; its skeletal frame had been dismantled and lay scattered.

Yang Kai drew a light breath, standing where he was with his brows tightly furrowed.

He had sensed just how troublesome the Bone Race could be.

Ordinary attacks had little effect; even fatal wounds offered no true harm. The only ways to truly destroy them were to burn them outright or violently disassemble them.

With Yang Kai's present strength, dealing with a First Stage of the Saint Realm cultivator was not difficult, yet facing a Bone Race creature required considerably more effort.

Across Shuilan City there were four or five such auras; one even displayed the energy fluctuations of a Second Stage Saint.

Something about the situation felt off.

At that moment a familiar life aura registered within his Divine Sense. Yang Kai shot into the sky and looked over, spotting Shui Ling of the Water Divine Hall fleeing in panic under the protection of a Saint Realm cultivator.

The Saint cultivator was no weakling—his body radiated dense water-qi, soft and flowing. He appeared to be in his forties or fifties, his robes soaked with blood; his Saint Yuan undulated uncertainly, the look of one who had endured a hard-fought battle.

The moment he appeared the four or five Bone Clans in Shuilan City detected him; beams of bloodlight shot from every corner.

To the Bone Clans he seemed a delectable feast, and they were keenly interested.

In the blink of an eye four or five Bone Clans rushed to surround him, encircling him as their ghostly eyes appraised him with ill intent.

Shui Ling he was guarding trembled, her face drained of color.

The middle-aged man wore a grim expression. He leaned in and told Shui Ling a few words; she listened with tears in her eyes, repeatedly shaking her head.

"Obey!" the man snapped sharply, unable to contain himself when he saw her hesitation.

Shui Ling froze, then nodded.

A resolute expression crossed the man's face. The gentleness of water-force erupted from him and the surrounding Water Spiritual Qi surged wildly.

Droplets of crystalline water materialized beside him, countless and innumerable.

Those columns of water shot forth like arrows, striking the Bone Race members from all directions with overwhelming power.

"Go!" he bellowed, forming hand seals as the spraying droplets converged into water-arrows of multiplied force.

The Bone Clans around him remained unfazed, allowing the water-arrows to pierce them while only being shoved aside by the tremendous force.

By the time the water-arrows formed, Shui Ling had already transformed into a mist and vanished into thin air.

She possessed a Water Spirit Constitution and was born with such a divine art. Yang Kai had once suffered greatly from this very move, and it was only by Di Mo's methods that she had been subdued.

Nevertheless, Shui Ling still failed to escape. One Bone Race member focused on a point in the void and unleashed an invisible Divine Sense attack. With a cry she reappeared, tumbling from the sky as fresh blood poured from her mouth and nose.

A string of raucous, cackling laughs rose from the Bone Clans—because they lacked much flesh their voices sounded like banshee wails, unbearably shrill.

One of the Bone Clans fixed a greedy gaze on Shui Ling, clearly coveting her flesh.

A Water Spirit Constitution's flesh could restore them far more rapidly than that of ordinary cultivators.

A streak of cyan light flashed and intercepted Shui Ling before she could hit the ground.

The Bone Clans' eyes hardened and they all turned with frenzied delight toward the cyan light, their Divine Senses flickering as if exchanging rapid information.

Held in someone's arms, Shui Ling finally made out her rescuer and cried, "Yang Kai?"

"Later!" Yang Kai shouted to the stunned middle-aged man below. "Get on!"

Without a second thought the middle-aged man leapt onto the Flying Shuttle.

With a flash of cyan light, Yang Kai had whisked the middle-aged man and Shui Ling a hundred li away.

The Bone Clans did not try to stop them, as if knowing there was no way to do so; they only watched Yang Kai's departing form and gave mocking cackles.

Their Divine Senses continued to communicate; after a moment one of them nodded and swiftly departed Shuilan City, heading toward the sea.
