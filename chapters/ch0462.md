## Chapter 462 — You Are Too Bold

Dong Fatty squinted at the pale-faced young man blocking his path and snorted coldly. He didn’t bother to argue and instead shifted his body, attempting to circle around him. At this moment, seizing the treasure was far more important.

But the man was relentless. He shifted his footing again and intercepted him once more.

Dong Qinghan chuckled lightly, his expression indifferent, but the aura emanating from his body grew increasingly dangerous.

"If you are an ally of Yang Kai, then don’t think you can pass through here!" The young man lifted his chin, his attitude haughty and arrogant.

"So it’s you," Dong Qinghan sneered. "The young master of the Lü Family." The man before him was someone he had met before—the very Lü Song who once led people and supplies to Yang Kai’s residence, seeking to join him.

However, this man had poor judgment. At the instigation of Qiu Yimeng, he provoked Yang Kai and was driven out, only to be beaten severely by Huo Xingchen and his men.

That incident bred deep enmity. After healing his wounds within War City, Lü Song immediately sought out Yang Kang as a backer, intent on driving Yang Kai out of the city.

Among all the scions who took part in the succession war, three hated Yang Kai deeply: Xiang Chu of the Xiang Family, Nan Sheng of the Nan Family, and Lü Song before him.

For various reasons, these three wished to see Yang Kai dead without a grave. Just now, when contesting the treasure, warriors from all three families were particularly hostile toward anyone allied with Yang Kai.

Lü Song sneered. "Young Master Dong, we have no quarrel personally, but since you chose to aid Yang Kai, I’m displeased. If I’m displeased, then you won’t have it easy either. I suggest you leave Yang Kai quickly before you bring death upon yourself."

"Go ahead and try!" Dong Qinghan knew he wanted to stall him, so he wasted no words. With that, his bulky frame suddenly surged forward like a lightning bolt tearing through the sky—quick, fierce, decisive.

The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians guarded him closely on either side, never leaving his side.

Lü Song’s expression turned grim as he barked, "No way out! Stop them!"

Two warriors at the Divine Roaming Realm’s seventh stage flanking Lü Song charged toward the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians.

Simultaneously, black light erupted from both his arms, his face twisting into a ferocious snarl.

The black glow carried a discomforting aura; chilling energy poured into his palms, his momentum like a surging rainbow.

In an instant, two pitch-black energy spheres appeared in his hands—each the size of a large basin, radiating intense killing intent.

He lifted his palms. The two spheres spiraled and crossed as they sliced through the air in wavy arcs, heading straight for Dong Qinghan.

Though Lü Song lacked insight, he was still a young master of a first-class family. Years of cultivation had granted him some skill.

At the seventh stage of the True Essence Realm, combined with this treasure’s power, this attack was troublesome enough to make many despair.

Should this strike land, it would be like sinking into quicksand—impossible to escape.

Dong Qinghan was more powerful than Lü Song, but with the treasures bolstering both sides, the difference in strength was negligible. Even if he were to defeat Lü Song, it would cost him precious time.

And time was exactly what he could ill afford.

Watching the incoming energy spheres, Dong Fatty took a deep breath. Under this breath, his slightly bloated body contracted somewhat, suddenly becoming spirited and handsome, wearing a stern expression. He exhaled sharply, like thunder in spring.

Suddenly, crescent-shaped wind blades appeared, slicing toward the two energy spheres.

The fierce collision of energies banished each other without a trace.

A trace of surprise flashed across Lü Song’s face. As he hesitated, Dong Qinghan darted past him like lightning, his less-than-fat body wrapped in the power and mysteries of wind, pushing his speed beyond limits.

No one realized Dong Qinghan cultivated a wind-type method. His appearance gave the impression of clumsiness, but he was as agile as a monkey leaping through the forest.

By the time Lü Song regained composure, it was too late to intercept.

However, the delay cost them—the mysterious treasure had already been snatched up by a martial artist. Fortunately, that person was only at the eighth stage of the True Essence Realm and unknown which family he was from. Dong Qinghan launched a fierce assault, leaving him dizzy and disoriented.

Realizing that although he was equal in realm he couldn’t match the other, the man went desperate and directly tossed the Divine Soul Treasure away.

Whether intentional or not, it flew toward the crowd watching the battle.

Lü Song laughed heartily and immediately chased after the treasure.

Dong Fatty glared resentfully at the man, no longer caring to contend with him, and quickly withdrew.

The treasure streaked through the air, leaving a dazzling light as it gradually descended upon the onlookers.

From previous experience, those watching dared not touch the treasure again and hurriedly parted, unwilling even to brush against it.

Only three remained—a young man of about twenty-seven or twenty-eight and a pair of twin sisters. The three pairs of eyes stared at the flying treasure with disbelief and forced smiles.

Judging from the trajectory, if no one intercepted, it would have fallen upon their heads, perhaps crushing them outright.

The trio hesitated but did not leave like the others.

Soon, the treasure landed directly overhead, caught by one of the twin sisters.

"You are way too bold," the young man shouted, his face suddenly pale. Everyone who attempted to seize the treasure earlier was killed silently. That served as a warning; even if one did not flee, no one would dare catch it.

The onlookers showed some regret. The sisters were enchantingly beautiful and young; if they died because of this, it would be an outrageous injustice.

This bold move was also noted by Lü Song and Dong Qinghan.

Lü Song, arriving first, laughed arrogantly and stretched out a hand: "Miss, hand it over, or you’re as good as dead!"

Dong Qinghan’s face darkened. Though anxious, there was nothing he could do. The spectators cared little for whether it was the Dong Family or Lü Family; to avoid death, they naturally handed the treasure to whoever reached it first.

If Lü Song managed to seize the treasure, it would be difficult to wrest it back.

The woman glanced at Lü Song and smiled, "Alright."

Her smile was irresistibly alluring, stirring Lü Song’s gaze. At such a critical moment, even he couldn't help but be shaken, his energy surging uncontrollably.

As he faltered, the woman casually threw the treasure. Swift as a shooting star, it flew beyond Lü Song’s head and toward Dong Qinghan.

Dong Fatty was so anxious he barely avoided being struck. Instinctively, he reached out and caught the treasure, then looked at the woman with surprise before frowning deeply.

He felt... that he had seen this woman somewhere before.

Lü Song’s face darkened abruptly. His large hand stretched out in mid-air but caught nothing. The humiliating pose ignited his fury.

"Courting death!" he roared fiercely.

His True Essence surged as he lashed out at the woman with murderous intent and no mercy.

But the woman remained composed, lightly slapping out a palm.

At her palm strike, the Wind and Cloud colors shifted. Mysterious forces wove an impenetrable shield, not only deflecting Lü Song’s killing strike but also sending him tumbling through the air, landing in a disheveled heap.

Gasps arose. Dong Qinghan was stunned as well.

No one expected this delicate-looking, somewhat enchanting woman to possess such strength.

So young, yet with a single move she sent the young master of a first-class family reeling. Such ability was no small feat.

"Hmph!" The woman showed disdain and disgust, snorting lightly before vanishing into the crowd. The other woman and the young man could only follow helplessly.

Lü Song’s spirit was shaken; he no longer had the heart to provoke trouble. Even if he had the upper hand against Dong Qinghan, this woman was clearly something else—stronger than both him and Dong Qinghan.

His expression flickered between red and pale, his True Essence wildly unstable.

Facing a first-class family scion, losing in skill was one thing, but now being outmatched by a nameless nobody was an insult to his pride.

After a moment’s hesitation, just as he was about to lash out and have his men seize the woman for torment, she vanished without trace, leaving Lü Song with the impotent feeling of striking a fist into cotton.

"Lü Song, I will take this treasure!" Dong Qinghan raised the Divine Soul Treasure with a victorious expression.

The Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians ceased their engagement with Lü Song’s two strong warriors and promptly returned to Dong Qinghan’s side.

"Just you wait!" Lü Song spat threateningly.

Dong Qinghan’s face grew cold. "Young Master Lü, I advise you to leave Zhongdu. Otherwise, you will die sooner or later. Those who offend my cousin have no happy ending."

"Then let’s see who dies first!" Lü Song retorted without gratitude.

Dong Qinghan shook his head lightly, cutting off further words, then turned and flew toward Yang Kai.

This skirmish was just a small fragment of the entire battlefield. The mysterious woman’s strength was witnessed by only a few before she was quickly forgotten amid the fierce fighting.

Only Dong Qinghan, flying back, frowned deeply. He thought long and hard but couldn’t recall where he had seen the twin sisters before. Their faces seemed familiar, yet strange—leaving him confused.

What troubled him more was the woman’s power; she was clearly stronger than him.

The appearance of the ninth batch of Heaven-Grade treasures had inflamed all the warriors’ blood, and so far only a few treasures had found their owners.

The rest were still fiercely contested. Once someone obtained a treasure, they became a target for countless enemies, forcing them to abandon it to divert attention and preserve their lives.

Thus, the treasures rapidly changed owners in an astonishing manner...
