## Chapter 896 — Observation Only

It had been only four months since Shui Ling advanced to the Transcendent Realm, so she indeed needed to stabilize her cultivation.

If one doesn’t wish to endure the tedium of sitting in meditation to comprehend the Heavenly and Martial Dao, then the only option is to rely on the power of Pills.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded, thought for a moment, then said, "For stabilizing your realm, one Tian Cang Pill is enough. I’ll match the remaining ingredients with others and refine a Soul-Replenishing Pill—it can strengthen your Divine Sense. The two pills need similar materials anyway."

"You know about pills too?" Shui Ling exclaimed in surprise.

"Uh… after being around that master for so long, I picked up a little."

"Then you handle it—I'm sure you won't shortchange me." She looked like she was handing over her life and fortune to Yang Kai, which left him speechless.

"You woman…" Yang Kai shook his head slowly, then glanced at Yun Xuan and his tone softened considerably. "And you?"

Yun Xuan seemed lost in thought; at his words her body shivered, and when she recovered she replied at once, "My father needs a Heavenly Secret Pill!"

"A Heavenly Secret Pill?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and turned to Yun Cheng with a smile. "So you're aiming to break into the Saint Realm, Senior Yun?"

Yun Cheng gave an awkward smile. "I see a glimmer of hope but can't comprehend its secrets, so I came here seeking a Heavenly Secret Pill to catch a glimpse of heaven's workings."

"Very well." Yang Kai nodded firmly. "If Senior Yun seeks to breakthrough, I will have the master give it his all and try to refine the best Heavenly Secret Pill possible to help Senior Yun pierce the mysteries of entering the Saint Realm!"

At that, Yun Cheng's expression brightened with joy. "In that case, I trouble Saint Lord Yang."

He said this while giving Yun Xuan a meaningful look.

Yun Xuan understood, rose, and offered a graceful salute. She said with difficulty, "Thank you, Yang… Saint Lord!"

Yang Kai nodded lightly, his expression a little complicated.

The crowd in the main hall watched on, seeming to notice something, each lost in thought.

Yun Cheng cleared his throat and handed over the medicinal ingredients he had prepared.

Yang Kai took them and instructed, "An Ling'er. See to my friends. I’ll take the materials over first."

"Mm." An Ling'er answered.

"Masters, follow me." Yang Kai called to Du Wan and the others.

In the side room the pill furnace still stood, the prepared batches of ingredients laid out beside it, waiting to be refined.

After arriving there, Yang Kai said, “Masters, please make yourselves at home. This junior usually refines pills here, so there’s not much by way of hospitality I can offer.”

"No matter. You focus on your refining; we came merely to observe. Whatever we learn is our gain. You needn't teach deliberately!" Chang Bao quickly found a good spot, sat cross-legged, and made himself comfortable.

"Indeed. We agreed on the way here; as long as you let us observe, that's enough—we won't interfere!" Du Wan nodded slightly.

"That will do." Yang Kai nodded. When refining he had to concentrate fully and truly had no time to lecture others; besides, he had no experience as a teacher—no qualification either. The five before him had each spent centuries immersed in pillcraft and held their own unique understandings. It was better to let them observe than to try to instruct.

"Young man, are you and that Yun Xuan an item? The way she looks at you seems odd!" Chang Bao suddenly asked with a grin, his small eyes twinkling.

"You disrespectful old man—what nonsense are you spouting?" Kong Ruoyu shot him a glare.

"Heh heh, just asking casually…" Chang Bao said, embarrassed laughter in his tone.

Yang Kai forced a bitter smile and nodded. "There are indeed complications… never mind, let's not talk about it. Time to refine pills."

He then took out the ingredients Shui Ling had brought, preparing to refine the Tian Cang Pill and the Soul-Replenishing Pill she needed.

These two pills weren't high-tier—both were merely Upper-Level Spirit-Grade. Yang Kai planned to use them to warm up before attempting the Heavenly Secret Pill.

The five masters immediately perked up, watching his every move as if afraid to miss a single detail.

Time passed bit by bit.

In the Saint Lord's courtyard, An Ling'er sat with Shui Ling and Yun Xuan chatting; they got along well.

As evening approached, Yang Kai, who had left earlier, returned once more.

Yun Cheng, who had been waiting anxiously, jolted and stood to look toward him, his body trembling slightly, clearly nervous.

When Yang Kai drew near he handed Yun Cheng a jade vial and said, "This is the Heavenly Secret Pill you need."

He tossed another jade vial to Shui Ling. "These are your Tian Cang Pill and Soul-Replenishing Pill."

Shui Ling took them with a smile, opened the vial and peered inside. She cried out in delight, "It really formed pill patterns! I thought the rumors outside were exaggerated, but it's true!"

Of the three pills, the Tian Cang Pill meant to stabilize a realm clearly bore pill patterns—its value far beyond ordinary pills.

Shui Ling's eyes shone with excitement; she was genuinely pleased.

"Next time you need anything, just come by and don't be polite with me," Yang Kai said with a smile.

"I won't be polite to you, that's for sure." Shui Ling pursed her lips, tucked the pills into her Spatial Pouch carefully, then looked up at Yun Cheng in surprise. "Senior Yun, what's wrong with you?"

At that moment Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu gathered close to Yun Cheng. Seeing his trembling hands and the rasping sound in his throat as he tried to speak but couldn't, they were at a loss and grew pale with worry.

"Pill… patterns!" After a long while Yun Cheng managed to choke out two words, exclaiming, "A Saint Pill with pill patterns!"

"Impossible!" Shui Ling gasped and leaned in to look; indeed, the Saint-Grade Lower-Level pill bore lines like the meridians of a human body.

Everyone stood there stunned into silence.

A Saint Pill born with pill patterns—its value was already incalculable.

For a moment, all eyes on Yun Cheng were filled with envy. Many silently wished they'd brought materials for refining a Saint Pill.

After all, refining here cost nothing, and Yun Cheng's father was precisely at the time he needed a Saint Pill.

"Congratulations, Senior Yun—may your wish be fulfilled!" Shui Ling composed herself and offered a cheerful congratulation.

"Congratulations to the Alliance Leader—this could well secure your entry into the Saint Realm," Ruan Xinyu hurriedly added.

"One cannot speak so surely. While the pill is rare, whether I enter the Saint Realm still depends on my own effort… Regardless, I must thank Saint Lord Yang for his help."

"You’re too polite, Senior Yun." Yang Kai smiled faintly and glanced at Yun Xuan, who returned a slight nod, her face showing gratitude.

She knew in her heart that Yang Kai must have had the master pour his full effort into the refinement—otherwise it would be too coincidental to produce a Saint Pill bearing pill patterns.

With the pills completed, Yun Cheng had no mind to linger; he was eager to return to Duao City and take the pill to probe the mystery of entering the Saint Realm, so he took his leave.

Yang Kai did not stop him.

"I'll leave as well. You seem busy and won't have time to keep me company; there's no point in staying." Shui Ling thought it over and decided to depart.

"I'll see you off," Yang Kai offered.

“This won’t do, I cannot possibly accept…” Yun Cheng turned pale with fright, but before he could finish speaking, Ruan Xinyu pushed him out and whispered, “This doesn’t concern you. Alliance Master, let’s go first.”

Yun Cheng immediately came to his senses, apologized to Yang Kai, and flew off beyond the Nine Peaks.

Shui Ling glanced meaningfully at Yang Kai and waved. "If you have time, drop by the Water Divine Hall and see me—don't vanish for years without a word."

"Noted." Yang Kai replied with a wry smile.

In an instant the main hall was left with only Yang Kai and Yun Xuan. Even Xu Hui and An Ling'er wisely slipped away without a trace.

"Let's go." Yang Kai signaled.

Yun Xuan nodded lightly and the two walked out side by side.

They walked in silence. Yang Kai pondered what to say; though something had happened between them in the past, under those circumstances he had been forced.

To deny it now after taking advantage would make him a brute; he kept quiet.

"I heard from your Sacred Land's Saintess that you didn't even take her?" Yun Xuan suddenly spoke.

"She told you that?" Yang Kai said, astonished.

"Women talk," Yun Xuan smiled faintly. "Why is it strange? You're the Saint Lord here and she's the Saintess—shouldn't you be together? Does that mean you even spurn someone like her?"

"It's not that I spurned her…" Yang Kai shook his head, unsure how to explain.

"Then you have another woman in your heart!" Yun Xuan declared flatly.

Yang Kai had to admire a woman's intuition; he didn't deny it and nodded. "There is."

"She's remarkable, isn't she?" Yun Xuan asked softly.

Images of Su Yan and Xia Ningshang flashed before Yang Kai's eyes and he wore a look of recollection.

Seeing him like that, Yun Xuan forced a bitter smile. "Never mind—no need to answer. I already know. As for what happened between you and me, don't worry about it. In those circumstances it was unavoidable. Consider it a pleasant memory I'll keep in my heart."

Yang Kai opened his mouth, as if to speak, then fell silent.

"Don't make that face, okay?" Yun Xuan's voice trembled slightly. "You think that taking advantage once means you owe me forever? I never cared… so why do you?"

"Yun Xuan…" Yang Kai's expression darkened; he stared at her, helpless.

Yun Xuan kept wiping at the corners of her eyes, yet the tears kept streaming, pearl after pearl. Suddenly she turned, grabbed Yang Kai's hand, and bit down hard.

Her pearly teeth sank into his flesh, blood welling out.

Yang Kai remained motionless, only watching her quietly.

So close they could feel each other's breath, Yun Xuan stared unblinking, stubbornness in her expression.

"You hurt me once, I'll hurt you once—then we're even!" Abruptly Yun Xuan released Yang Kai's hand, swallowed the blood, wiped the trace from her mouth, and turned to leave.

Tears rained down.

A voice gradually carried after her: "You cold-hearted man, you'd better keep that high, lofty position so I can only look up at you. If you ever fall from your pedestal, I won't let you off easily!"

Yang Kai forced a bitter smile.
