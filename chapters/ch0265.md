## Chapter 265 — Cousin, Run Fast

Yao Wang Valley, a special force that has inherited thousands of years of history, is filled with masters of alchemy and elite disciples, most of whom are outstanding alchemists.

Its strength may not be particularly formidable, only slightly stronger than some second-rate sects, far inferior to the combat power of first-rate sects.

However, its influence is unmatched by any other force.

Every martial artist, during their cultivation and growth, must consume various Pills, all of which are produced by alchemists.

For alchemists across the world, Yao Wang Valley is regarded as a sacred place.

Whenever an alchemist mentions Yao Wang Valley, they do so with utmost reverence and admiration. Many even consider entering Yao Wang Valley to learn the art of alchemy and pay homage to the legacy of the Dan Sheng as their lifelong goal.

Dan Sheng, the founding ancestor of Yao Wang Valley, has long been dead for countless years, yet the passage of time has not diminished his sacred status in the hearts of alchemists. It is said that the lineage of alchemy was passed down by Dan Sheng, branching out from Yao Wang Valley, allowing today's martial artists to have Pills to consume during injuries and cultivation.

Before Dan Sheng imparted the art of alchemy, martial artists only knew to seek herbs and swallow them indiscriminately!

This is merely a legend, and legends often contain exaggerated elements that should not be fully trusted.

However, there is one truth in this legend: Dan Sheng indeed existed! His portrait now stands in the forbidden area of Yao Wang Valley, enduring the test of thousands of years without decay, which in itself is a miracle.

Although the name of Yao Wang Valley contains the character for "valley," this force is not situated in a valley.

Surrounding it are more than a dozen towering peaks, each reaching a height of a thousand zhang, forming a circular arrangement that spans several hundred li.

This area of several hundred li is entirely occupied by the sect of Yao Wang Valley.

Each peak hosts powerful alchemists, some widely accepting disciples and branching out, while others practice in solitude, comprehending the art of alchemy. Occasionally, there are one or two acres of medicinal fields on these peaks, growing various precious herbs that are tantalizing to behold.

The entire Yao Wang Valley is rich in countless alchemical materials.

The central position surrounded by these peaks is a valley-like existence, contrasting with the tranquility of the surrounding mountains. This valley is bustling year-round, with martial artists coming and going like a continuous stream.

The reason is simple. The small town built in this valley serves as a place for Yao Wang Valley to interact with martial artists from the outside world.

If martial artists wish to refine Pills, they must bring sufficient materials. They come here to seek the disciples of Yao Wang Valley for assistance in refining. The disciples of Yao Wang Valley do not charge gold or silver but take one-third of the Pills produced as their fee.

No matter what quality of Pill you come to refine at Yao Wang Valley, whether it be Common-Grade or Heaven-Grade, if the refinement fails, there is nothing to say. If successful, three out of ten Pills will be the alchemist's reward.

This method of charging raises some suspicions of being overly demanding, as each Heaven-Grade Pill is quite valuable. Collecting materials is a laborious task, and not only does one bear the risk of losing everything if the refinement fails, but even if successful, one-third must be given as a reward.

Yet, even so, it cannot diminish the enthusiasm and determination of martial artists to come to Yao Wang Valley to refine Pills.

Because here, the failure rate for alchemists is very low, and the quality of the Pills produced is generally higher than those refined by outside alchemists.

Thus, even with such harsh conditions, martial artists are still willing to seek out alchemy here, as it is far better than risking their materials being destroyed by outside alchemists.

The reputation of Yao Wang Valley is known throughout the world, attracting not only martial artists from the Great Han but also individuals from surrounding nations who frequently come here to request the elders of Yao Wang Valley to refine Pills.

The elders generally do not act lightly. To request them to refine, one must at least provide Heaven-Grade or even Mystery-Grade materials, and the fees will be even higher.

Yao Wang Valley has ten elders, each stationed at one of the ten surrounding peaks, all possessing extraordinary skills and mastery in alchemy, enigmatic and unfathomable.

Ordinary people, even the disciples within Yao Wang Valley, rarely see them. These elders are all in their sixties or seventies, spending years in closed-door cultivation to study alchemy. They only emerge when particularly rare and expensive materials appear.

Within the town of the valley, shops are plentiful, but not all of them belong to Yao Wang Valley; about ninety percent are set up by various forces from across the world.

After all, this is the center of alchemy for the world, and these forces establish shops here to sell medicinal materials, gather resources, and gather intelligence, among other uses.

Yao Wang Valley itself remains aloof, never offending any force in the world, nor deliberately befriending any particular force, maintaining a transcendent position for thousands of years.

Fighting is strictly prohibited in the town, so even though martial artists come and go endlessly, no one dares to breach this rule within the town.

If someone fights in the town, there is no need for the people of Yao Wang Valley to intervene; others will immediately kill the fighting parties on the spot.

However, once outside the valley, all grievances will no longer be the concern of Yao Wang Valley.

Thus, within a thousand li around, there are two completely different worlds.

The valley surrounded by peaks is lively and peaceful, while outside the valley, spanning dozens of li, one can see fighting and killing everywhere. These people are resolving disputes that arose within the valley, daring not to act on the spot, instead agreeing to settle their lives and deaths outside.

One day, a horse-drawn carriage came from afar, stopping fifty li away from Yao Wang Valley.

The coachman put away his whip and called into the carriage, “Young master, we have arrived at Yao Wang Valley!”

“Arrived?” Yang Kai awakened from his meditation, his face brightening with joy. He lifted the curtain of the carriage and stepped out, looking around in astonishment, “Where is this place?”

Surrounding him was an expanse of emptiness; this was clearly the wilderness.

The coachman smiled and explained, “Young master, you may not know, but the area outside Yao Wang Valley is fraught with danger. We ordinary people dare not approach recklessly. Whenever there are guests to be sent to Yao Wang Valley, we only deliver them here and then turn back. To go further is to enter the gates of hell.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brows. Noticing the coachman’s anxious expression, he cautiously explained the various circumstances surrounding Yao Wang Valley.

After hearing this, Yang Kai gradually relaxed his brow, realizing that what he said was indeed true and not an intentional abandonment.

He decided not to dwell on it any longer; after all, it was only a matter of dozens of li. He casually took out a silver note and handed it over, employing his footwork to approach the distant peaks with ease.

Although he had just heard the coachman speak of the dangers outside Yao Wang Valley, witnessing it firsthand far exceeded Yang Kai’s imagination.

As he approached, within thirty li, he encountered four or five groups of people engaged in fierce battles. These individuals were all resolving conflicts that had arisen within the valley.

As he walked along, he even saw several corpses on the ground still radiating residual heat.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but click his tongue in astonishment, adhering to the principle of not meddling in others' affairs while outside, and quietly slipped away.

Not far ahead, a sudden commotion of shouts and cries of pursuit erupted behind him, accompanied by the sound of fluttering garments.

Yang Kai frowned and turned to look.

He saw a girl in a sky-blue long dress rushing towards him. She appeared to be around sixteen or seventeen years old, quite beautiful, but at this moment, her face was filled with panic as she ran desperately.

Behind her, six or seven figures were hot on her heels, their faces filled with anger and killing intent, each wielding swords and knives, looking ferocious.

“Stop right there, you little brat!” a furious shout came from behind.

The girl ran even faster.

“Quick, don’t let her escape into the valley! If she gets inside, we’ll never catch her!” Seeing that the girl was heading towards Yao Wang Valley, those pursuing her changed their expressions dramatically.

Fighting is strictly prohibited within Yao Wang Valley; if the girl rushes in, everything will be over!

In the blink of an eye, the girl dashed right in front of Yang Kai.

Seeing Yang Kai eyeing her warily, the girl smiled sweetly, revealing her pearly white teeth, and then, gathering her strength, breathlessly shouted, “Cousin, run!”

Yang Kai frowned, his expression darkening. Before he could react, the girl had already zipped past him like a gust of wind, leaving behind a faint fragrance.

“Not good! That little brat has backup! Don’t let a single one escape! Kill the man and capture the women!” The person who had shouted earlier changed his expression drastically.

The group of pursuers seemed to have been injected with adrenaline, their speed suddenly increasing.

“Damn it!” Yang Kai’s expression turned furious, gritting his teeth in anger. He didn’t want to waste time entangling with those people, turning around and chasing after the girl.

Neither the girl in the light blue long dress nor the group of Great Han behind her possessed particularly high strength; the strongest among them was only at the True Yuan Realm, around the Third or Fourth Stage.

This level of strength was not something Yang Kai took seriously, but getting involved in such a troublesome matter made him seethe with anger.

Activating his self-created footwork, he closed the distance in just a few breaths, catching up to the girl.

The girl was momentarily stunned, turning her head to see Yang Kai grinning at her with a terrifying smile.

“Cousin…” Yang Kai gritted his teeth, calling out affectionately.

“Ha ha…” The girl’s pretty face immediately turned sour, goosebumps rising all over her body. She never expected Yang Kai, despite his young age, to be so fast.

Before her laughter faded, Yang Kai’s expression darkened. In mid-run, he reached out a large hand and grabbed towards the girl.

The girl’s expression changed dramatically as she raised a delicate hand to meet his.

Yang Kai activated his True Yuan, clashing with her in a brief confrontation.

The girl’s figure swayed, her speed suddenly decreasing significantly. Before she could react further, Yang Kai had already wrapped one arm around her waist and grabbed her wrist with the other, abruptly halting their forward momentum.

“What… what are you doing? Run!” the girl shouted in panic, watching helplessly as the group behind them rapidly closed in.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, twisting his waist, and in the girl’s startled cries, he directly threw her towards the group of pursuers.

“You…” The girl’s eyes widened in disbelief, never expecting Yang Kai to take such an action.
