## Chapter 2616 — What Do You Think?

Zhou Yong believed that as long as he showed a bit of determination, the Sect Master would definitely grant his wish. After all, he had fought for the Sect for so many years; even if he had no achievements, he had worked hard.

“So you’re the Great Elder Zhou.” At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly chuckled, looking at him with a playful expression, and said, “Why don’t you tell Sect Master Fu why your grandson died?”

Fu Bo was taken aback, thinking that was a good point. Zhou Yong had come in and immediately accused that Great Emperor of killing his grandson, but why would a Great Emperor attack a mere First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator for no reason? Normally, she probably wouldn’t even spare him a glance, let alone make a move.

Zhou Yong snorted coldly, “No matter what mistakes Ji’er made, you still shouldn’t have killed him!”

Yang Kai was momentarily speechless, then after a while, gave a thumbs up and praised, “Great Elder, you truly are domineering!”

Zhou Yong shouted angrily, “Ji’er is this Lord’s grandson. If he made some minor mistakes, it’s understandable, but you all struck him down mercilessly! Today, I have come here to take your lives and avenge my Ji’er!”

“Minor mistakes!” Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh, then looked at Fu Bo and said, “Sect Master Fu, that Zhou Ji became lustful at the sight of beauty and, without asking, tried to forcibly abduct Lady Feng at my side to serve him in bed. Sect Master Fu, what do you think of that?”

“Forcibly abduct? Serve in bed?” Fu Bo was startled, cold sweat pouring down his forehead, the world spinning before his eyes. He felt as if there would never be light in this world again.

In front of Lady Feng, even he had to behave himself and not dare to act rashly. Yet Zhou Ji actually dared to try to abduct her? And wanted her to serve him in bed? That was simply courting death.

Only now did he finally understand why a Great Emperor would attack a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

And with what he knew of Zhou Ji, that spoiled brat really was capable of such things.

Yang Kai looked at Zhou Yong with a smile and said, “Today this Young Master has truly witnessed the majesty of the Great Elder. As expected of someone from a grand Sect—your manner of speaking is indeed extraordinary. It has truly broadened my horizons. As you say, had your grandson still lived and received your personal guidance, then in the future… he would surely have become someone of great promise. After all, like grandfather, like grandson.”

“There’s no point in saying any of this now!” Zhou Yong stared coldly at Yang Kai, killing intent swirling, “Only your deaths can quell the anger in this old man’s heart!”

Turning his head, he looked at Fu Bo and once again said in a deep voice, “Sect Master, please grant my wish!”

Fu Bo’s face was as dark as water, inwardly cursing that the Great Elder was so blind today. He was about to secretly send a message to explain Luan Feng’s strength when Yang Kai suddenly spoke, “Sect Master Fu, since this Great Elder is willing to leave your Sect just to kill us, why not let him have his way? If you keep interfering, no one will be happy.”

Hearing this, Fu Bo immediately understood what Yang Kai meant. He let out a heavy sigh, closed his eyes, and adopted an attitude of staying out of it.

“Many thanks, Sect Master!” Zhou Yong was overjoyed, turned around, and fiercely gathered his Emperor Yuan, slamming his palm down toward where Yang Kai and the others stood.

That posture made it clear he intended to slap Yang Kai and the others to death in one blow.

“A mere speck of light dares to compete with the sun!” Luan Feng snorted coldly. Without any visible movement, her body suddenly appeared in front of Yang Kai. She raised her hand, and a jet-black flame shot toward Zhou Yong.

As soon as that black flame appeared, it exuded an aura capable of incinerating all things.

Zhou Yong’s palm strike collapsed instantly, his entire body shuddering violently as his defenses fell apart, leaving him completely exposed.

“What?” Zhou Yong’s expression changed drastically. His eyes filled with terror as the aura of death rushed toward him. He cried out, “Sect Master, save me!”

Only now did he realize he had kicked an iron plate. This dignified and beautiful woman’s strength far surpassed his own; he was no match for her at all.

Fu Bo’s tightly shut eyes snapped open, but before he could say a word, Yang Kai’s cold voice rang out, “Sect Master Fu, I advise you not to bring disaster upon yourself!”

Fu Bo’s heart skipped a beat, and the words on his lips were swallowed back down.

“Ah!” A miserable scream rang out as that wisp of World-Ending Black Flame turned into a ball of fire, enveloping Zhou Yong and setting him ablaze.

Just like with Wu Yuanzheng’s death, the more Zhou Yong desperately pushed his Emperor Yuan, the fiercer the flames burned on his body, as if his Emperor Yuan had become fuel.

“Sect Master...” Zhou Yong was still screaming miserably, his voice utterly tragic, still trying to beg for help.

Although Fu Bo felt pity in his heart, he didn’t dare to intervene at all. He could only watch helplessly, his expression bleak.

It was only after a full ten breaths that Zhou Yong turned to ash. That wisp of World-Ending Black Flame was recalled by Luan Feng with a casual wave.

The current Great Elder of the Netherworld Sect had died just like that.

After venting her anger, Luan Feng still seemed unsatisfied. She glared at Yang Kai and said, “Sir Yang, I’m sorry, I forgot about his Spatial Ring again.”

How could that be forgetting? She had clearly done it on purpose, knowing that even if she killed Zhou Yong, the Spatial Ring wouldn’t end up in her hands and would only benefit Yang Kai, so she simply burned it to nothing.

Yang Kai bore a great deal of responsibility for today’s events. Luan Feng was clearly still annoyed that Yang Kai had dodged aside earlier, forcing her to kill that spoiled brat.

If Yang Kai hadn’t dodged, there wouldn’t have been so much trouble today.

Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and said awkwardly, “It’s fine, it’s fine!”

Seeing Yang Kai like this, Luan Feng’s anger eased considerably. In fact, with the descendant of Heaven's Punisher protecting him, she really shouldn’t give him a hard time. But now, seeing Yang Kai completely unbothered, she found him rather likable.

Turning his head, Yang Kai looked at Fu Bo and said, “Sect Master Fu, Lady Feng killed your Sect’s Great Elder. You have no objections, do you?”

Objections? He had the biggest objection in the world! Of the three Third Stage Emperors in the Sect, only he was left now. How could he not object? But what could he do about it?

Fu Bo had seen Luan Feng make her move and recognized the origin of that jet-black flame. Hearing Yang Kai call her Lady Feng, he had already guessed her identity.

Divine Spirit Luan Feng! One of the Four Great Saint Venerables of the Wild Ancient Land, commanding eight Yao Kings and the Saint Envoys, each one no weaker than himself.

Though not a Great Emperor, she was comparable to one. If he angered her, she could easily send a few Yao Kings to wipe out the Netherworld Sect.

With a bitter heart, Fu Bo forced a smile and said, “Zhou Yong already left the Sect earlier. He’s no longer one of us, so whether he lives or dies has nothing to do with us!”

He was also full of doubts. How could the dignified Divine Spirit Luan Feng be willing to follow a human cultivator and be ordered around so easily?

Just what kind of hidden background did this Yang Kai have?

Yang Kai looked at Fu Bo with deep meaning and smiled, “Sect Master Fu, you truly are a wise man. Since that’s the case, let’s continue discussing the compensation from earlier!”

“No need.” Fu Bo gave a bitter smile. “I will make sure you are satisfied.”

Earlier, when Yang Kai made outrageous demands, he had wanted to bargain. But now, he just wanted to send these calamities away as quickly as possible. His disciple had set his sights on Luan Feng’s beauty and tried to abduct her. The fact that she hadn’t wiped out his entire Sect was already a blessing. How could he dare say anything more?

As he spoke, Fu Bo took out a Transmission Compass from his Spatial Ring and poured his Divine Sense into it, clearly communicating with someone.

After putting away the compass, Fu Bo forced a smile and said, “Please wait a moment.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded, then suddenly said seriously, “Sect Master Fu, I actually came to Netherworld Sect for two things. The first is done, but the second still needs to be discussed with you.”

Fu Bo’s heart skipped a beat. He didn’t know what else Yang Kai wanted and nervously asked, “May I ask what else you require?”

Yang Kai smiled, “Sect Master Fu, don’t be so nervous. The second matter is just a small favor. I just want to borrow your Sect’s Space Array.”

“Borrow the Space Array?” Fu Bo’s heart relaxed, as if he had gone from hell to heaven. He said with relief, “No problem, no problem.”

He had been worried about what the second matter would be, but it turned out to be just borrowing the Space Array.

“Where do you want to go?” Fu Bo asked tentatively.

Yang Kai replied, “The Northern Territory!”

“The Northern Territory is so far...” Fu Bo frowned and said, “Our Sect’s Space Array is a large one, but it can’t teleport directly to the Northern Territory. To go there, you’d need a cross-territory Space Array. As far as I know, only the Soul Palace in the entire Eastern Territory has one, and it’s a relic from ancient times.”

“The Soul Palace has a cross-territory Space Array?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in surprise.

“That’s what I’ve heard, but I’ve never seen it myself.”

Yang Kai nodded.

Even if Fu Bo had seen it, Yang Kai wouldn’t go borrow it. The Soul Palace was guarded by Great Emperor Youhun; it wasn’t a place just anyone could cause trouble in.

Besides, Yang Kai had clashed with Great Emperor Youhun’s daughter, Yao Lin, before. Last time, when Great Emperor Youhun descended with his soul, he hadn’t made things difficult for Yang Kai, but if he went there now, who knew what would happen?

“Since I can’t cross territories, just send me to the place closest to the Northern Territory,” Yang Kai said.

“No problem. I’ll personally arrange it for you in a moment,” Fu Bo agreed readily.

“Sir Yang is going to the Northern Territory?” Luan Feng, who had been listening for a while, finally spoke up.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded and glanced at Ji Yao.

Ji Yao’s condition was unstable. Although she still mistook him for Senior Bing Yun and behaved herself at his side, who knew when her mind would become confused again.

He wanted to go to the Northern Territory to send Ji Yao back to Ice Heart Valley. With Bing Yun personally taking care of her, perhaps Ji Yao could recover.
