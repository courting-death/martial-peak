## Chapter 1744 — One Hundred Thousand Li Would Also Do

Yang Kai laughed loudly. "Brother Gu, you actually believe such rumors? The Seven Orifices Exquisite Pill is indeed an excellent Spiritual Pill, but it's not heaven-defying to that extent. As far as I know, this Spiritual Pill does nothing to increase comprehension or improve innate talent; instead, it has unexpected, miraculous effects in repairing the soul."

"I see. Brother Yang, you know the Dao of Pills so well—could you be an alchemist?" Gu Jianxin's eyes brightened.

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. "I'm not an alchemist. These two Spiritual Pills were simply taken out of the Imperial Garden by me."

He had long since prepared an excuse for the origin of the two Spiritual Pills.

"Imperial Garden!" Qin Wuhui breathed, increasingly appreciating how rare those two Spiritual Pills truly were.

"I see." Gu Jianxin also looked relieved. "Only a place like the Imperial Garden could have such ancient Spiritual Pills. It seems you visited when the Imperial Garden opened a few years ago, Brother Yang?"

"Indeed."

A look of longing crossed Gu Jianxin's face, but he sighed, "When the Imperial Garden opened I was in seclusion. What a pity—otherwise I might have become friends with Brother Yang years earlier."

"It's not too late now," Yang Kai smiled.

"True enough." The regret vanished from Gu Jianxin's face.

"Young Master Yang…" Qin Wuhui stood below, his expression torn between gratitude and unease. "I am unworthy to accept such a great gift!"

"You needn't say that, Elder." Yang Kai interrupted him. "There are conditions attached to my giving you the Seven Orifices Exquisite Pills."

"Young Master Yang, please say them!" Qin Wuhui hurriedly said; he feared that if Yang Kai demanded nothing, the matter would feel unresolved. Two Seven Orifices Exquisite Pills were priceless and not handed out casually; hearing Yang Kai's words relaxed him somewhat.

"It's like this." Yang Kai pondered. "As you know, I had known the sisters He Zao and He Miao for decades. To chance upon them now in the vast Star Domain was fate. Moreover, I heard they and you seemed to have an agreement. As for what that agreement contains…"

Yang Kai did not continue. He trusted that Gu Jianxin and Qin Wuhui understood his meaning.

The two sisters, He Zao and He Miao, who had been standing behind him, were stunned for a moment and then their expressions brightened; their eyes widened, delight and surprise mingling, and even their breathing quickened slightly.

"So that's how it is." Gu Jianxin chuckled, his smile full of significance as if he'd learned some astonishing secret.

Qin Wuhui displayed some embarrassment and guilt; he clasped his fist and said, "This matter was my selfishness—I acted without consulting He Zao and He Miao about their wishes; that was my fault. Young Master Yang, since you have magnanimously granted my son two ancient Spiritual Pills to help him recover, I guarantee the previous agreement is hereby voided."

"Thank you, Elder." Yang Kai raised his cup and stood, smiling. "You speak plainly, Elder; I drink a cup in your honor."

"No, no." Qin Wuhui quickly raised his cup as well, his face solemn. "My son was foolish and deserved misfortune; now that Young Master Yang has saved him, I thank you. I will discipline him strictly in the future and guide him onto the proper path—I will not betray your benevolence!"

The two of them drained their cups, and Yang Kai then took his seat.

At a corner table in the hall, Yue Xi cast a grateful look toward Yang Kai.

She had not expected Yang Kai to settle the matter so easily. Ordinarily such an affair would offend someone; no matter how agreeable Qin Wuhui might be, and no matter how high Yang Kai's position was in Gu Jianxin's estimation, this was the sort of thing that would bruise another's pride.

Yet because Yang Kai had two ancient Spiritual Pills to pave the way, Qin Wuhui not only did not lose face but actually profited.

It was a case in which everyone came away pleased.

Only… such a price could be produced casually by Yang Kai alone.

"He Zao, He Miao!" Qin Wuhui called, not immediately taking his seat; he waved his hand and two streams of light flew toward the sisters.

The sisters, still elated, reflexively caught the two lights in their hands, then looked up at Qin Wuhui.

"I have caused you worry these past days; consider these two items as compensation. I hope you will assist the Young Master wholeheartedly in the future and bear me no grudge," Qin Wuhui said earnestly.

"We would never," He Zao and He Miao replied, bowing in unison, then began to examine the objects in their hands.

A glance revealed both to be Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasures! Both were curved blades that appeared capable of combining into a circular cutting edge; treasure-light shimmered across them, and they looked quite valuable.

At their cultivation level, it was ordinarily impossible to obtain Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasures unless bestowed by a master or elder.

Yet Yue Xi herself was not particularly wealthy—where would she have so many Secret Treasures to give? Only someone like Qin Wuhui could casually produce two Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasures.

The sisters both knew that such treatment was all thanks to Yang Kai! Without Yang Kai, how would Qin Wuhui have casually gifted them two Secret Treasures?

Standing behind Yang Kai and gazing at his back, both pairs of beautiful eyes were filled with gratitude.

"Brother Yang…" Gu Jianxin could only force a wry smile, holding his forehead. "You did this and now I don't know how to repay you; we haven't even finished discussing the Soul-Breaking Spear."

Previously he had promised to compensate Yang Kai for handing over the Soul-Breaking Spear; Yang Kai had not immediately demanded anything. Now, though dealings between him and Qin Wuhui looked like a fair exchange, any clear-eyed person could see Yang Kai had taken the larger loss!

After all, whether Qin Wuhui or the He sisters, they were all members of the Sword Alliance. Yang Kai gave away two Spiritual Pills and received nothing in return, and those were two ancient Spiritual Pills, long gone from the world.

Thus Gu Jianxin suddenly felt he owed Yang Kai a great debt.

"Brother Yang, tell me—what compensation do you want? I'm ready to be thoroughly bled dry," Gu Jianxin joked.

"That's unnecessary." Yang Kai smiled. "I've already thought of compensation, and for you it will be effortless."

"Oh? Do tell." Gu Jianxin adopted a serious manner, and the others looked to Yang Kai. They wanted to know what he would ask. Qin Wuhui in particular looked intent, as if ready to do whatever it took once Yang Kai stated his terms.

"We're heading to Qingmu Star, right?" Yang Kai asked.

"Yes."

"Tell me—does the Sword Alliance have full control over Qingmu Star?"

"Yes! Qingmu Star is entirely our Sword Alliance's Cultivation Star," Gu Jianxin said proudly. "The Sword Alliance controls three Cultivation Stars like Qingmu Star!"

"Then it's simple." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "I want a plot of land with a radius of ten thousand li. Hmm. I won't take rich land—just not something too barren will do."

"Ten thousand li?" Gu Jianxin raised his brow.

"Five thousand li would do as well," Yang Kai added.

"Ha! Brother Yang, you're too modest. Not to mention ten thousand li, one hundred thousand li would be fine!" Gu Jianxin laughed and patted Yang Kai on the shoulder. "A one hundred thousand li domain means little on Qingmu Star. Fine—it's settled. When we reach Qingmu Star I'll have someone negotiate with you; as for the exact spot, you choose!"

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned but reacted little, smiling: "If you say so, Brother Gu, I won't stand on ceremony."

After all, he was the Star Lord of Dark Star; a mere one hundred thousand li domain was not a major burden.

"There's no need for formalities between us!" Gu Jianxin waved his hand. Lingyue immediately stepped forward to refill the cups for him and Yang Kai.

"Brother Yang, may I ask what you intend to do with that land? Do you plan to settle on Qingmu Star?" Gu Jianxin asked eagerly, full of expectation.

If Yang Kai truly thought that way, it would undoubtedly be good news for Gu Jianxin. He had been worrying over how to draw Yang Kai to his side, but if Yang Kai intended to settle on Qingmu Star, wouldn’t that mean he would have countless opportunities to interact with him in the future?

"Not necessarily to settle—a temporary residence would do nicely," Yang Kai chuckled.

"What ambition, Brother Yang!"

"Brother Gu, how about I propose a business deal?"

"Speak, Brother Yang."

"I need a large quantity of Ethereal Crystal. Can you acquire any? Of course, I can use Saint Crystals to purchase them or trade other items—I won't let the Sword Alliance lose out."

"Brother Yang, you're being too courteous. If it's a trade, I of course won't refuse. But… Ethereal Crystal is scarce across the Star Domain. How about this: once we're on Qingmu Star, I'll help you make inquiries."

“Good, then I’ll trouble you with that.”

……

The banquet lasted the entire day before it dispersed and the guests left.

Yang Kai returned to his chamber, bathed, and dispelled the lingering smell of wine.

Soon after, Yue Xi arrived together with her disciples He Zao and He Miao to pay him a visit and express their gratitude.

To him it was a trivial matter. The materials used to refine the Seven-Orifice Linglong had been collected by him over many years; the only slightly precious ingredient was the Inner Core of that Seven-Colored Stag.

That had been a prize he obtained after killing a variant of a Seven-Colored Stag demonic beast in the Imperial Garden; he had stored it unused until now, and it just so happened to be suitable for refining the Spiritual Pills this time.

But for the master and her two disciples, it concerned their future.

Yang Kai could feel the trio's heartfelt gratitude, and it moved him.

The positions they stood in were different, the power they possessed was different, and naturally what each could accomplish varied greatly as well. Just like an iron rod that an ant could never shake no matter how it struggled—yet a mere mortal could lift it with ease.

After sending them off, Yang Kai closed his doors to visitors and, while there was still time on the journey, began cultivating his various secret techniques.

Whether it was the Golden Blood Threads, the Undying Five Elements Sword, or spatial power, all required time to accumulate and settle.

After more than twenty days and no further incident following the ambush by Li Minghai and the others, the warship finally arrived at Qingmu Star!
