## Chapter 401 — Fourth Master Yang's Insight

The steward briefly recounted the events that transpired after Yang Kai's departure. Listening with keen attention and combining it with his own investigations, Yang Kai began to grasp the overall situation.

Once outside the door, Yang Kai carefully senses the surroundings. To his astonishment, he discovered that the True Essence of the two elders was vigorously circulating, radiating a bold aura around them, indicating that some changes had occurred.

However, the circumstances faced by the couple were slightly different.

Dong Suzhu had already broken through, but her aura was not yet stable, and the energy within her body had not been fully absorbed. Once she completed the absorption, her cultivation at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm would solidify completely.

On the other hand, Yang Yingfeng faced a more dangerous situation. Fourth Master Yang had originally been at the Third Stage of the Spirit Realm, but had now broken through to the Fourth Stage — and was even showing signs of pushing toward another breakthrough.

The shackles within a martial artist's body were like a lock; each breakthrough was akin to opening a lock and pushing open a door. Any martial artist could only unlock these through years of diligent cultivation, and during this time, they could consume some heaven-and-earth treasure to expedite their progress.

However, the immense energy contained within the Wan Yao Ling Ye had allowed Fourth Master Yang to open the first lock and push through the first door in a brief span of time, and now he was trending toward opening the second lock.

Breaking through two stages consecutively was a blessing, yet it also posed a threat.

Yang Kai had often broken through several stages in the past, but at that time, his strength was low, and such rapid ascents posed no danger.

Fourth Master Yang was different; he had a chronic ailment, and was originally at the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. Now that he reached the Fourth Stage, he should take the time to consolidate his cultivation, but due to the influence of the Wan Yao Ling Ye, he had not been afforded the necessary buffer time.

If his comprehension of Martial Arts was insufficient, it was very likely he would be unable to breakthrough to the Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, resulting in the immense energy within him to explode uncontrollably.

Conversely, if his understanding of Martial Arts had reached a certain level, this would not only prevent misfortune but could also yield great benefits.

The key lay in whether he himself had sufficient comprehension of Martial Arts.

Yang Kai focused his Divine Sense, allowing various thoughts to cross his mind. After a moment of mild panic, he managed to calm himself, gesturing to the steward, “It’s fine now. You can leave. I’ll keep watch here. If anyone visits in the next few days, say that my father’s chronic ailment has relapsed and that he is recuperating.”

“Yes.” The steward nodded slightly and retreated, obediently complying with Yang Kai’s instructions.

He withdrew his formless and intangible Divine Sense, enveloping the location of his parents to prevent any aura from leaking out.

In this way, those outside would be unaware of the commotion within.

After completing these tasks, Yang Kai stood quietly outside, waiting.

He felt no worry. He had enough confidence in Fourth Master Yang.

If not for what happened in the past, Fourth Master Yang's strength would not be so low. Over the years, his rate of improvement had indeed been slow, but the passage of time had allowed him to grasp Martial Arts insights that were not inferior to others.

Moreover, Fourth Master Yang’s innate talent was not lacking. After so many years of accumulation, ascending to the Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm was hardly a major issue for him!

However, Yang Kai did not expect that the two elders would cause such a stir due to the Wan Yao Ling Ye.

Half a day later, the aura belonging to Dong Suzhu stabilized, indicating she had absorbed all her energy and consolidated her cultivation.

In contrast, Yang Yingfeng’s momentum continued to rise steadily, seemingly with no end in sight.

Another half day passed, and his aura suddenly surged upward as if breaking through the heavens, soaring up to ninety thousand miles. In the midst of this explosive ascension, the energies in the world became chaotic.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but break into a grin, and within the house, Dong Suzhu’s exclamations of surprise could be heard.

Her voice was filled with exuberance and excitement.

As the peak momentum quickly receded, moments later, everything fell silent.

“Kai'er, come in!” Yang Yingfeng’s authoritative voice rang out from within the room. Yang Kai pinched his nose and stepped inside.

Fourth Master Yang's tone seemed slightly off. Yang Kai guessed he would have to face some questioning. It was understandable; the effects of the Wan Yao Ling Ye were simply too astonishing for the two elders not to be suspicious.

Upon entering the room, Yang Kai grinned, glancing around silently at his surroundings.

Dong Suzhu gazed at Yang Kai with a mixture of amusement and pity, biting her red lip, remaining wordless as well.

Yang Yingfeng furrowed his brow, breaking the silence, “Speak honestly, what exactly did you give us to take?”

Before Yang Kai could speak, Fourth Master Yang added, “Don’t even think of saying it’s a concoction made from the materials I provided to you. I know the quality of those materials. It’s absolutely impossible to create such a miraculous treasure!”

“Fourth Master Yang is brilliant!” Yang Kai’s expression turned serious as he quickly complimented.

Dong Suzhu nearly burst into laughter, and Yang Yingfeng also struggled to contain a smile, yet he still maintained his stern demeanor, fixing his gaze firmly on Yang Kai.

“These treasures are called Wan Yao Ling Ye, crafted from tens of millions of pills of various grades, refined over thousands of years through special formations.” Yang Kai paused briefly before casually explaining a few details.

Fourth Master Yang and his spouse were taken aback, staring in astonishment at Yang Kai.

Tens of millions of pills, spanning thousands of years...

At first glance, it sounded entirely far-fetched.

Yet Yang Kai's expression indicated this was the truth.

No wonder it had such powerful effects.

The accumulation of time and quantity had long elevated these medicinal liquids beyond worldly realms, and it seemed that obtaining these treasures had not been easy for Yang Kai either.

Thinking of this, the couple both felt a pang of heartache. It was not for the preciousness of the Wan Yao Ling Ye, but for the effort and trials Yang Kai endured to obtain these liquids.

“Must be quite valuable, huh?” Yang Yingfeng gazed deeply at him, refraining from asking about their origins.

“A lot.” Yang Kai reassured him, but then couldn’t help but inquire, “How much did you drink?”

Fourth Master Yang's face turned red, and Dong Suzhu's expression became awkward as well.

After a long moment, Dong Suzhu finally gestured lightly, “I just had a little at the bottom; your father drank an entire cup!”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but break into a dry laugh. He truly did not expect the elders to have such courage.

It was also his fault for not clarifying the effects of the pills, only reminding them to take one drop a day, but the two elders assumed the Wan Yao Ling Ye was concocted from some heavenly-grade materials. Who would have thought its effects would be so overwhelming?

As a result, one had broken through a stage, and the other two stages, but this was not a bad thing.

“From now on, you cannot drink like that again,” Yang Kai admonished.

The two elders nodded solemnly.

This breakthrough was an unexpected delight. Dong Suzhu had broken through to the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, effectively exempting her from several years of arduous cultivation.

And Fourth Master Yang gained even more. Not only had his strength increased by two stages, reaching the Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, but even the evil energy that had been tightly bound in his Dantian seemed to show signs of loosening due to the breakthrough’s awakening.

Not daring to be complacent, Yang Yingfeng immediately chose to enter seclusion, using Wan Yao Ling Milk to expel the evil energy that had clung to his Dantian for many years.

Dong Suzhu also needed to enter seclusion to stabilize her current cultivation.

The residence of Fourth Master Yang instantly became serene, with only Yang Kai and a dozen servants of the family moving about.

The Golden Feather Eagle visited once daily, seeking food from Yang Kai.

Five days later, Du Chengbai came to visit, excitedly informing Yang Kai of good news. He had received approval from the Xiang Family to exchange a set of Mystery-Grade Martial Skill for a Golden Feather Eagle. He urged Yang Kai to hurry to the Elder Hall to present the martial skill.

This was indeed good news for Yang Kai.

The only dilemma for him was which set of Mystery-Grade martial skill to use to exchange for the Golden Feather Eagle.

He possessed few martial skills, and only two sets were of Mystery-Grade; besides Star Mark, there was only the Ten Thousand Swords Return to One from the Jiu Xing Sword Sect, which primarily relied on his True Essence’s adaptability and his reactive combat skills.

Martial skills could significantly enhance combat power for martial artists in the early stages of cultivation, but at Yang Kai’s current stage, unless it was a Mystery-Grade martial skill, skills of lower grades could not fundamentally alter his strength. The changes brought about by Yang Liquid and the Proud Bone Golden Body were more than sufficient.

After much deliberation, Yang Kai ultimately decided to hand over Star Mark to the family.

Firstly, this martial skill had significant drawbacks; it required ample preparation time to execute. Even if others practiced it, storing energy for the use of Star Mark would present challenges, so Yang Kai did not need to worry about others using this move against him.

Secondly, Ten Thousand Swords Return to One was a secret skill of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect. If others learned that Yang Kai mastered this skill, it would inevitably link him to the rumored death of Wu Chengyi, the elite disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect.

The strength of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect was not to be underestimated, and Yang Kai currently had no desire to become their enemy.

When doing business in the Yang Family, as long as you had bargaining chips, efficiency was always high, unlike in other families where you had to navigate through networking.

The Yang Family placed great importance on benefits.

Upon reaching the Elder Hall and presenting the Star Mark martial skill, the white-haired elder immediately provided Yang Kai with a document to find Du Chengbai. The Golden Feather Eagle that had accompanied Yang Kai back was thus officially transferred.

From this day forth, it would belong solely to Yang Kai, not the Yang Family.

On the day of acquiring the Golden Feather Eagle, Yang Kai brought it to the Bamboo Segment Gang, allowing Pang Chi and others to rear it and transmit information, saving Yang Kai from needing to run around.

Three days later, Yang Wei, the eldest of the younger generation of the Yang Family, returned to Zhongdu, and on the same day, two other direct descendants of the Yang Family also returned.

Two days later, yet another person returned.

The resounding cries of the Golden Feather Eagle echoed throughout Zhongdu, seemingly stirring an undercurrent, signaling that the direct descendants of the Yang Family had nearly all returned, with the conflict for succession not far off.

The Yang Family juniors who had returned to Zhongdu were frequently interacting with the young masters and misses of the other seven families, but only Yang Kai remained unfazed, as if the power struggle had no connection to him.

Among the Yang Family’s younger generation, the most popular were undoubtedly Liu Qinyao from the Liu Family and Qiu Yimeng from the Qiu Family. To date, both had received countless invitations, yet neither had made any clear commitments to stand with any particular Yang Family junior.

Rumors suggested that Liu Qinyao had said that whoever could defeat him would forge an alliance with him!

The words of this young expert at the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm had caused the Yang Family’s juniors to roll their eyes in unison.
