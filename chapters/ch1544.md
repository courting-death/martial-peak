## Chapter 1544 — Setting Sail

In all things, gains and losses balance each other — the Creator has ever been fair.

Those born with unusual constitutions may hold advantages in certain domains, but most also bear flaws that cannot be ignored.

Xia Ningshang's Medicinal Spirit Saint Body allowed her to refine pills with ease and grow stronger in the process. Yet this was the only path for her to increase in power; the slow, normal method of sitting in cultivation would be far too inefficient for her.

Shan Qingluo's Poison Widow Lineage often destined its women to lose the ones they loved, to live a life of loneliness—and that sorrow would be wrought by their own hands, for on their wedding night they would cruelly slaughter the one they loved.

It was a torment beyond imagination for anyone.

Xue Yue's Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body, though formidable, would ultimately serve as a wedding dress made for another.

Lin Yun'er's Force Tyrant Body was no different.

That overwhelming, savage power would in the end become something Lin Yun'er herself could not bear; if the force she used exceeded the limits of her flesh, the final result would be self-destruction!

"No solution?" Yang Kai asked, sounding somewhat worried.

"There is!" Ye Xijun nodded lightly.

"Oh? Tell me then. If there is a solution, we'll just do it." Yang Kai's eyes brightened. Lin Yun'er was still young and full of potential; he did not want such a girl to be troubled by her own immense strength in the future, or worse, to perish because of it.

"It's simple in description, but difficult in practice…" Ye Xijun gave a wry smile. "Yun'er’s flaw is obvious; if we target that flaw and temper her body, it will do. In other words, as long as her body's strength can support the exertion of her power, there will be no danger. But to temper the body requires a corresponding skill—one of sufficient caliber. Low-grade methods won't do."

"A body-tempering skill!" Yang Kai's expression turned peculiar.

"Indeed. Star Emperor Mountain also has body-tempering techniques, but those things simply can't meet Yun'er's requirements. Over the years I've been asking around for such methods, but found nothing of worth; even the techniques I collected are inferior to the ones originally from Star Emperor Mountain." Ye Xijun looked a little despondent. "Yun'er has only been with the Sect for three years and her power has already grown so terrifyingly. If I let her continue unchecked—within ten years…"

"If a body-tempering method is needed… I do have one."

"Sect Master has such a thing?" Ye Xijun stared at him in astonishment.

"Mm." Yang Kai said as he took a tome from his Spatial Ring and handed it to Ye Xijun. "Take a look at this."

Ye Xijun accepted it, glancing at Yang Kai with suspicion before sinking her mind into the text and studying the method carefully.

Yang Kai remained silent, not disturbing her; instead he entertained Lin Yun'er at his side. The little girl was still young. She had lived previously with Huang Juan in Haicheng City, cramped in a single room never seeing daylight, and later came to the Lingxiao Sect.

She had never had contact with the outside world, so her innocence was unblemished; her childish words brought a calm to Yang Kai's heart.

Two hours later, Ye Xijun exhaled, put down the tome, and a look of pleasant surprise shone in her eyes.

"What does the Great Elder think?" Yang Kai looked up and asked.

"Not bad!" Ye Xijun said with excitement. "It should allow Yun'er to cultivate. This method is rather peculiar—its rank is not especially high, but the achievement gained from it does not depend on the method's rank so much as on the materials used."

"Mm, I thought so too. When I cultivated the Undying Five Elements Sword myself, the higher the quality of the materials I found, the better the results of the body tempering—it's not so much about the method itself." Yang Kai grinned. "The most valuable thing is that the materials required for it can be substituted."

To practice the Undying Five Elements Sword, one must locate Five Elements Treasures.

At the worst, they could not be lower than the Inner Core of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast.

Yang Kai had expended a great deal of effort to gather them before.

Now that the Lingxiao Sect's strength had grown, collecting such Five Elements Treasures shouldn't be difficult; even if the gathered items weren't as good as Yang Kai's Sun's True Essence and Dayan Divine Sand, at minimum they should be items of a grade like Xuan Gold.

Once they were assembled, let Lin Yun'er begin cultivating with them now; later, when better materials were found, they could be swapped in—this would not affect the cultivator in any way.

Ye Xijun had seen this point as well, which was why she looked so excited.

"Sect Master, rest assured; I will only let Yun'er cultivate this method and will not pass it on." Ye Xijun's expression turned grave.

"No matter, even if you spread it, I doubt many could cultivate it." Yang Kai chuckled.

The Inner Core of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast equated to an expert of the Void King Realm; how many could hunt such creatures? So it did not matter much if the method were leaked.

"But cultivating it requires very strong Divine Sense power, otherwise one cannot endure that bone-drilling, marrow-gnawing pain." Ye Xijun looked at Lin Yun'er with pity in her eyes.

The little girl, naive and inexperienced, did not yet know what had happened to her; she only knew that she was very strong, not knowing that this strength was like a noose about her life, slowly tightening.

"Then the Great Elder will have to train her." Yang Kai laughed.

"Mm, I'll arrange for Yun'er to practice Divine Sense power with me as soon as possible." Ye Xijun nodded.

"Put Yun'er's matter aside for now. Great Elder, I have other matters to ask you about." Yang Kai's expression turned serious as he looked at her solemnly.

"Speak, Sect Master."

"I'll be setting off soon on a long voyage. I will take some disciples from the Sect; otherwise the warship cannot function. Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi, and Lin Yurao, the three Elders, have agreed to leave with me. Great Elder, will you come along?"

"Me?" A trace of hope flashed across Ye Xijun's face, but she quickly shook her head. "Sect Master, I appreciate your kindness, but I will not go."

"I thought so…" Yang Kai sighed, as if he had expected as much.

Ye Xijun's strength was peerless—she could be said to be the foremost on Dark Star. Her power had matured and she had already probed the threshold of Domain, making her long-qualified to advance to the Void King Realm.

In this regard, no one could rival her.

In fact, if freed from the constraints of Dark Star's heavenly laws, Ye Xijun's cultivation would have at least an eighty percent chance of breaking through to the Void King Realm given her present merit.

That probability was terrifying!

However…

The Great Emperor still slumbered in the pavilion; she could not in good conscience leave.

Yang Kai had long suspected this, but still had to ask; now that he had her answer, he did not press the matter.

"If that's the case, then Great Elder, I entrust everything in the Sect to your care." Yang Kai said slowly.

"With me here, the Sect will be safe."

"Mm, I trust you to manage things." Yang Kai nodded. "When you have time, remember to help me find someone."

"Find who?" Ye Xijun asked, puzzled, not knowing who he could be so attached to.

"Liu Yun Valley's Lu Ye!" Yang Kai gave a cold, mirthless chuckle. "If you find him, don't waste words. Kill him outright."

"Understood!" Ye Xijun nodded.

She did not know why Yang Kai sought that man, but since it was the Sect Master's wish, she would not question it.

Yang Kai rose to take his leave and make final preparations for departure.

He asked Ye Xijun to be wary of Lu Ye as a kind of precaution in his heart.

He vaguely felt that this Lu Ye was problematic; aside from repeatedly opposing him, Yang Kai had his reasons to mistrust the man, and his actions were thoroughly strange. Every time Yang Kai saw him he felt an unusually odd sensation.

That feeling made him wary—Lu Ye seemed far from ordinary.

Though the chance of success using the warship for a long voyage was high, one still had to prepare thoroughly.

Various supplies had to be readied, and personnel assignments had to be carefully arranged.

The entire Lingxiao Sect mobilized.

In just a few days, everything was ready.

Five days later, Qian Tong arrived at the Lingxiao Sect upon receiving the news.

Fei Zhi Tu did not come. City Lord Fei, having nearly died in the Fallen Emperor Mountains, had fallen to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; even leaving Dark Star with Yang Kai gave him no hope of breaking through, so he preferred seclusion in Tianyun City.

He had missed such an opportunity, and Qian Tong could only lament.

From Qiantian Sect came Mo Yu.

More than three years earlier, Yang Kai and Qiantian Sect had already agreed that Qiantian Sect would take one slot. How they decided internally Yang Kai did not know; their Sect Master Gu Zhen did not come, but Mo Yu—who was more familiar to Yang Kai—did.

Old acquaintances, they could not avoid exchanging pleasantries upon meeting.

Lingxiao Sect sent out three cultivators of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—naturally Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi, and Lin Yurao.

These five would carry the hopes and expectations of the countless warriors of Dark Star accumulated over tens of thousands of years; whether they could reach the Void King Realm depended on their efforts and their fortunes.

Yang Kai merely provided them an opportunity.

Since ancient times, breaking from the Origin Returning Realm to the Void King Realm has been exceedingly difficult. Across the Star Domain, there are not many of the Void King Realm; each one is a renowned figure, worshipped by the martial artists of their own cultivation star.

So even if these five had the qualifications to break through, their path might not go smoothly.

They might very well all fail!

Half a month later, at Tianyi Palace, Yang Kai opened his eyes from meditation and rose, then strode out.

Opening the palace gate, he found a woman dressed as a young married lady waiting quietly.

Seeing Yang Kai emerge, she drew a deep breath; her chest rose and fell, and from nerves and excitement her fists clenched.

Qian Yue!

Of course Yang Kai would not leave her behind on this voyage.

As someone from the same continent as Yang Kai, she too longed to find Ice Lord Qing Ya, to find Su Yan, and to find the other members of the Ice Sect.

She yearned above all to see again those faces that haunted her heart.

"All set?" Yang Kai asked.

Qian Yue nodded. "Everything is prepared; we're just waiting on you."

"Then… let's go." Yang Kai smiled and strode forward.

In his clenched fist lay a translucent pearl that gave off a faint chill.

Su Yan's Ice Soul Pearl! As long as the pearl remained, Su Yan lived; if the pearl shattered, she would die.

With that pearl Yang Kai was certain Su Yan lived somewhere in the Star Domain; with it he believed they would one day meet again.

Half an hour later, the black warship slowly rose into the air as the disciples of Lingxiao Sect below cheered them off until the warship vanished from sight.
