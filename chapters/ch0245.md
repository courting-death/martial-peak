## Chapter 245 — The Change of Allies and Enemies

Hearing her words, Yang Kai's desire was instantly extinguished, and he frowned, "How many died?"

"Six! Instant death, one Fifth-Tier, five Fourth-Tier!" Zi Mo's face showed some horror, her brows tightly knitted. While scrambling to get up from under Yang Kai, she hurriedly adjusted her clothes to cover her exposed upper body.

It seemed she recalled something, as her spring-like eyes furtively glanced down at Yang Kai's lower body before quickly averting her gaze, her face flushed like blood, glimmering with an alluring sheen.

"Do you know who did it and how many people there were?" Yang Kai asked in a deep voice.

Zi Mo controlled the Demonic Beasts through the Control Soul Insect, allowing her to sense their life and death within a certain range. However, grasping more information was quite difficult, as she had not witnessed it with her own eyes.

"I'm not too sure," Zi Mo shook her head.

"Let's go take a look!" Yang Kai decisively said.

"There might be danger," Zi Mo hesitated, "What if it's that expert who escaped before…"

She was naturally referring to Wu Chengyi. In this unfamiliar place, being able to instantly kill six Demonic Beasts indicated that the opponent's strength was certainly formidable.

"If it's him, that would be even better," Yang Kai couldn't help but feel eager. Wu Chengyi had previously sent a Junior Brother to hunt him down, and Yang Kai had not forgotten that debt. Sooner or later, he would settle the score, especially since Wu Chengyi likely possessed treasures like Liuyan Liquid.

Whether for revenge or to seize treasures, Yang Kai had no reason to let him go.

Seeing Yang Kai so stubborn, Zi Mo found it hard to dissuade him. Moreover, even if it truly was Wu Chengyi, he would not fare well against Zi Mo's army of Demonic Beasts.

After hastily issuing commands, Zi Mo led the remaining Demonic Beasts towards the location of the incident. Leng Shan, with weak legs, followed closely behind, the two women walking side by side, deliberately keeping Yang Kai behind them.

Yang Kai paid no mind, following behind while remaining vigilant of the surroundings.

"What's wrong with you?" Leng Shan keenly noticed Zi Mo's change and couldn't help but ask softly.

"What?" Zi Mo seemed a bit lost, as if she hadn't heard Leng Shan's words.

"You seem a bit off," Leng Shan curiously scrutinized her. "Weren't you supposed to seduce him and make him uncomfortable? Why did you just now…"

After thinking for a long time, Leng Shan finally found a suitable descriptor, "You seem to be enjoying it?"

Zi Mo wished she could dig a hole and hide, her ears and neck flushed red. Gritting her teeth, she whispered, "Stop talking about that. Don't seduce him again in the future, or else… it might lead to playing with fire…"

"Ah…" Leng Shan was taken aback.

What a loss!

She initially thought Yang Kai wasn't a real man, so Zi Mo didn't take his lewdness to heart. Even if he kissed or touched her, what of it? He wasn't a real man. What more could he do? Even if she stripped naked in front of him, he could only touch her a little.

But she never expected that Yang Kai was not as she imagined.

The sensation from that moment lingered in Zi Mo's mind, and every time she recalled it, she felt a deep sense of shame. Internally, Zi Mo was not as bold and daring as she appeared on the surface.

However… since he truly was a man, why was it that a few days ago, he remained indifferent when faced with her and Leng Shan, who were nearly undressed? What man could resist such an easily obtainable temptation? Could he truly be a gentleman?

Lost in her thoughts, they soon arrived at the place where the six Demonic Beasts had perished.

There were some bloodstains on the ground, but the corpses of the Demonic Beasts were already gone, having turned into blood beads taken away by someone, leaving only piles of powder behind.

Yang Kai glanced around, his brows furrowing.

Zi Mo squatted down, rummaging through the powder, and after a moment, her expression changed.

"What is it?" Leng Shan asked.

"The Control Soul Insects… are gone," Zi Mo's face turned pale as she meticulously searched through another pile of powder. Yet, after searching all six piles, she found not a single Control Soul Insect.

"There's no need to search anymore. The one who killed your Demonic Beasts is not an expert from the Jiu Xing Sword Sect!" Yang Kai looked at Zi Mo with a playful expression, "There are no traces of sword energy left here."

"What do you mean?" Zi Mo's expression grew uneasy as she vaguely guessed something but dared not confirm it. Or rather, she didn't want to confirm it.

"You know in your heart; do you really need me to say more?" Yang Kai scoffed.

"It can't be…" Zi Mo shook her head lightly, her voice low, her heart wavering.

Suddenly, Zi Mo looked up towards a direction, "My Demonic Beasts have died again!"

Yang Kai sneered, further solidifying his suspicions. Tilting his head, he looked at Zi Mo, "Should we go take a look?"

Zi Mo's expression struggled, hesitating for a long time before she finally nodded slightly.

However, this time, she no longer dared to scatter her Demonic Beasts to the periphery. She gathered them all back and hurriedly headed towards the second location.

Half an hour later, Zi Mo stood up in disappointment once more. There were four piles of powder here, and there should have been four Control Soul Insects, but just like before, those insects had vanished without a trace.

"Was it your two fellow disciples who did it?" Leng Shan finally reacted, looking at Zi Mo in astonishment.

The Control Soul Insects were a unique method of Zi Mo and her companions. If it were Wu Chengyi who killed the Demonic Beasts, he wouldn't have the ability to take the Control Soul Insects as well.

Moreover, to kill two batches of Zi Mo's Demonic Beasts in such a short time, the assailant must either be very powerful or have many people.

Combining the clues of the Control Soul Insects' disappearance, the identity of the assailant became clear!

As fellow martial artists from the Senluo Palace, Zi Mo's two fellow disciples certainly knew how to take her Control Soul Insects and had the strength to instantly kill so many Demonic Beasts.

They commanded quite a number of martial artists from the Great Han.

Yet, Zi Mo couldn't believe this fact and was unwilling to accept it! They were fellow disciples; how could they turn against her so ruthlessly?

Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes, extending her senses outward in an attempt to locate her Control Soul Insects, but no matter how hard she tried, she could not find them.

Moments later, she opened her eyes, a cold and ruthless look in them as she surveyed her surroundings, a cold smile on her lips.

"We should leave here first!" Yang Kai frowned, pulling Zi Mo's arm without further ado and dragging her away.

Two hours later, the three of them were already a hundred miles away. Ten Demonic Beasts had suddenly died, including two Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts, significantly reducing Zi Mo's strength.

Stopping to rest, Zi Mo sat to the side, her expression shifting unpredictably, sometimes cold, sometimes confused. At times pained, at times fierce, Leng Shan and Yang Kai exchanged glances, both speechless, knowing her heart was struggling at this moment.

Yang Kai signaled Leng Shan with his eyes to offer some comfort, but Leng Shan ignored it and turned her gaze away.

Yang Kai was speechless and could only remain silent.

After a while, Zi Mo finally groaned in pain, heavily gasping for breath, looking at Yang Kai with a hint of pity, "Why did they do this?"

"You'll have to ask them," Yang Kai replied lightly.

"We're fellow disciples; although there's competition between us, it shouldn't come to this, right?" Zi Mo found it hard to understand.

"What of being fellow disciples?" Yang Kai said dismissively, "Fellow disciples are the most terrifying!"

"Do your fellow disciples kill each other?"

Yang Kai and Leng Shan were taken aback.

Zi Mo was astonished, her brows furrowing. She sighed, "Perhaps we are all from a small branch of the Senluo Palace, so there aren't many fellow disciples. That's why we took care of each other in Tianlang. Even if there was competition, it wasn't too extreme."

"This isn't Tianlang, nor is it your Senluo Palace," Yang Kai said with a stern face.

"Exactly because of this, we should support each other," Zi Mo still found it hard to accept.

"I thought you were a ruthless woman, but I didn't expect you to be so naive!" Yang Kai sneered. Zi Mo's ruthlessness was likely only directed at the martial artists of the Great Han. When facing her fellow disciples, she still had some reservations and couldn't let go.

Zi Mo smiled bitterly, about to speak when her expression suddenly turned agonized. She collapsed to the ground, clutching her head and crying out in despair.

Yang Kai and Leng Shan's expressions changed, rushing forward.

Zi Mo seemed to be suffering tremendous torment, gripping her hair tightly with both hands, her body curling like a shrimp, tense and sweating profusely.

This reaction was identical to how Yang Kai had tormented her before.

It was a response to damage to the soul!

Yang Kai and Leng Shan exchanged glances, both seeing a hint of horror in each other's eyes.

Zi Mo's pain persisted for quite a while before gradually subsiding. Her clothes were soaked with sweat, her body weak, but her eyes turned icy cold.

"It’s them! They are warning me, summoning me! They want me to go!" Zi Mo gritted her teeth, a murderous intent flashing across her face. After speaking, she grabbed Yang Kai's clothes, looking at him seriously, "Help me kill them!"

Yang Kai grinned, "I was already thinking that."

A few days ago, when Yang Kai had proposed it, Zi Mo had rejected him. Yet, the situation had developed so dramatically; Zi Mo still had some principles and didn't want to turn against her fellow disciples, but her two companions clearly did not share such kindness.

"Where are they?" Yang Kai asked.

"This way!" Zi Mo pointed in a direction, "It's about an hour's journey!"

"An hour, let's think this through." Yang Kai frowned, then placed Zi Mo on his back, carrying her towards that direction.

Lying on Yang Kai's back, Zi Mo felt strange. They could only be considered enemies, yet now they had to work together to deal with her two fellow disciples. The shifting roles of allies and enemies made her feel as if she were walking on clouds.

On the way, Zi Mo briefly recounted the situation regarding her two fellow disciples.

Those two were from the same family, being cousins, both possessing Fourth Stage True Yuan Realm strength.

One was named Yao He, and the other Yao Xi. Each controlled around fifty Demonic Beasts, totaling over a hundred. In terms of numbers alone, they had more than double the Demonic Beasts under Zi Mo's command, who only had around thirty to forty.

In a direct confrontation, they would absolutely lose, but as long as they found a way to kill one of them, the Demonic Beasts controlled by the deceased would fall into chaos, creating a chance for victory amidst the turmoil.

Fueled by anger, Zi Mo recounted every detail about her two fellow disciples, and Yang Kai listened quietly, silently memorizing the information while constantly strategizing on how to achieve victory.
