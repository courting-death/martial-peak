## Chapter 1341 — Cloud Beasts

Thoughts racing, Yang Kai saw that Lian Guang was already driving his puppets to engage one of the Eighth-Tier cloud beasts the likes of Fei Zhi Tu and the others had deliberately left behind; that cloud beast’s body was neither wholly solid nor wholly insubstantial, completely refined from clouds and endlessly shifting — the moment it charged it was locked in fierce combat with Lian Guang’s puppets.

Yang Kai did not hesitate either; with a flick of his figure he intercepted another Eighth-Tier cloud beast that was trying to join the fight.

Fei Zhi Tu and the others had deliberately left behind these two Eighth-Tier Cloud Beasts. First, because they were already fully occupied dealing with the other Cloud Beasts and couldn’t spare the effort for more; and second, because they intended to test the combat strength of Yang Kai and Lian Guang, to make sure the two weren’t just putting on airs and wouldn’t become a burden later on.

The Eighth-Tier Demonic Beast that Yang Kai intercepted resembled a ferocious giant tiger, with the character meaning “king” clearly marked on its forehead. Its long tail gleamed with a metallic luster, as if forged from refined steel, and its massive body stood three zhang tall. Yet its entire form was an eerie shade of emerald green, making it look strange and unsettling.

As it moved a rank stench rolled over, making one want to retch — Yang Kai immediately realized this cloud beast had likely been fused with some virulent poison.

Without waiting for its reaction Yang Kai shook out his golden threads, turning them into a sky of golden light that incessantly sliced through the beast’s body; roaring out, the tiger’s form instantly broke into fragments, cut into countless pieces as if utterly crushed.

But seeing this did not please Yang Kai; rather, he felt alarmed, for the beast’s momentum had not weakened in the slightest from his cutting — if anything it had grown more ferocious.

When the golden threads retracted, the shredded tiger body, amid writhing and fusion, astonishingly restored itself to its original form without a single wound to be seen, its breath not diminished in the least.

This cloud beast truly was hard to kill. If it had been an ordinary Eighth-Tier demonic beast, Yang Kai’s slicing would have left no burial place, but this thing was not made of flesh and blood; even when scattered it could reassemble. It seemed Du Sisi had not spoken lightly before.

Understanding that, Yang Kai withdrew his golden threads. With a motion of Divine Sense a clear birdcall sounded, and the crimson Fire Bird Artifact Spirit gracefully appeared. With a single beat of its wings it transformed into a giant bird dozens of zhang across, then at Yang Kai’s command it surged toward the tiger.

The tiger’s eyes showed a flash of terror; instinctively recognizing the Artifact Spirit was no easy opponent, it no longer carried the arrogance and disdain it had shown toward Yang Kai moments before. Opening its maw, it spewed a great ball of jade-green poisonous vapor that enveloped itself and obscured its outline.

The Fire Bird Artifact Spirit showed disdain, its proud cry ringing out as it plunged without hesitation into the poisonous cloud.

For a time jade-green and crimson lights tangled together; tiger roars and bird cries rose and fell, while Yang Kai stood with his sleeves folded, watching coldly from the side.

Wisps of jade-green were steamed away by the scorching heat and vanished; in mere moments the poisonous fog that had wrapped the tiger thinned and faded, and the tiger’s form reappeared.

Now the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit completely dominated the high ground, spewing scalding flames from its beak that continuously burned and evaporated the tiger’s poison, suppressing it so it had no means to fight back; the tiger’s furious roars turned into plaintive cries, and each time it was scorched by flame it revealed a look of terror.

The Fire Bird Artifact Spirit pressed its advantage without mercy; the flames it exhaled grew bolder and more ferocious, as if determined to utterly eradicate the tiger.

Nearby, the martial artist surnamed Wen guarding Cai He and Du Sisi watched with eyes shining, staring at the raging Fire Bird and unconsciously revealing a trace of envy.

Word had spread that Yang Kai had rampaged in Tianyun City and slain an Origin Returning Realm from the Xie Family; many knew he possessed a remarkable Artifact Spirit, and that the spirit was fire-attributed.

This was also why the old man Ning Xiangchen and the other two had continually sought to ingratiate themselves with Yang Kai along the way.

It was for no other reason—once one reached the Origin Returning Realm, each of them possessed several Origin-Grade Secret Treasures. However, many of these Secret Treasures had been damaged in battle, their power greatly diminished. To repair such treasures, it was necessary for an Origin-Grade artificer to personally take action.

Origin-Grade artificers were exceedingly rare on Dark Star; Yingyue Hall’s sole master, Gelin, had died half a year ago. These Origin Returning Realm figures had no avenue to repair their Secret Treasures.

Upon learning Yang Kai owned a Fire Bird Artifact Spirit, their hearts stirred immediately.

If they could borrow Yang Kai’s Fire Bird Artifact Spirit for a time, with their strength they might manage to repair some of those damaged Secret Treasures; even if they could not restore them to perfection, it would certainly be of great benefit.

If that were not the case, the three Origin Returning Realm experts would not have humbled themselves along the way; they were not so idle with nothing to do.

Now that the martial artist surnamed Wen had seen the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit’s ferocity with his own eyes, he was overjoyed; such an Artifact Spirit must have been born from a high-grade refining furnace, and he had heard that during Yang Kai’s Tianyun City rampage Yang Kai had indeed wielded a furnace-like Secret Treasure.

If his conjecture was correct, that must be the Secret Treasure which houses the Artifact Spirit.

With an Artifact Spirit and a refining furnace, one need not be a master artificer to get results. But to borrow such a precious object would not be easy — one must first make others trust you, and there must be a bond as if lives were on the line.

While Wen was thinking fancifully and looking for an opportunity to help Yang Kai in order to curry favor, he did not realize Yang Kai’s fight with that cloud beast required no assistance; this left him delighted at the spirit’s power but also a little regretful.

Lost in his idle thoughts, he suddenly saw the tiger’s body shrink to two-thirds its original size; after the Fire Bird’s pursuit a good portion of the clouds forming the tiger had been evaporated.

After all, the beast’s spirit had fused with that of a demonic beast; sensing danger it howled, and its vast body suddenly expanded, radiating an extremely perilous aura from within.

Yang Kai’s expression stiffened; the Artifact Spirit’s eyes rolled and it immediately flew up, distancing itself from the tiger’s position.

In the next moment the tiger’s body suddenly exploded, and amid the blasts jade-green lights shot everywhere and scattered in five directions — but those green lights instantly transformed into mini tiger shapes and fled.

The Fire Bird Artifact Spirit was taken aback and enraged. It had assumed the tiger, sensing it could not prevail, wished to self-destruct its spirit; instead it had only feinted to escape.

With wings spread it hurled blistering fireballs that struck those jade-green forms with pinpoint accuracy, purging them completely.

But when the tiger’s body burst apart there were simply too many jade-green figures, and the Artifact Spirit could not cover them all — a few dodged its fireballs and by fortune survived.

Yang Kai grinned; with a wave of his hands vast nets of pitch-black demonic flame shot forth, enveloping the fleeing figures.

None escaped; the jade-green figures that had narrowly avoided the Fire Bird’s attack were all trapped within those great nets.

The Heaven-Encompassing Net, a Nine Heavens Divine Technique, was precisely suited for use at this moment.

Though the Nine Heavens Divine Technique was a martial skill from the Tongxuan Continent, the potency Yang Kai could now exert had grown with his strength; moreover these nets were formed of demonic flame.

With sizzling sounds the trapped jade-green figures struggled in the Heaven-Encompassing Net but could not break free, and under the scalding power of the demonic flame they were burned to nothing.

In a short while, the tiger cloud beast vanished without a trace.

Yang Kai breathed out softly, knowing that without the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit’s intervention it would have been difficult to slay such a cloud beast by his own means. Though demonic flame could counter its toxins, Yang Kai himself was not immune to the poison as the Artifact Spirit was; in a solo duel he would be constrained and possibly face unexpected turns.

Calling back the Artifact Spirit, Yang Kai glanced sideways and saw Lian Guang looking over — his fight had also ended, and the cloud beast he had entangled with his puppets now lay slaughtered into scraps.

Their eyes met and both showed surprise; Yang Kai did not know what method Lian Guang had used to slay a cloud beast in such short time, and Lian Guang equally could not gauge Yang Kai’s capabilities.

It was only when Lian Guang saw the Fire Bird perched on Yang Kai’s shoulder preening its feathers that a look of understanding crossed his face and a trace of disdain flickered in his eyes, clearly assuming the Artifact Spirit had done the killing.

The two then both looked up toward the not-too-distant scene to check how the Origin Returning Realm figures were faring.

At the sight their faces both darkened.

Because after the two had slain their respective cloud beasts, the surrounding drifting clouds wriggled and another cloud beast emerged — and this time the beast gave off the aura of a Ninth-Tier demonic beast.

Realizing this not only made Yang Kai and Lian Guang’s expressions sour, it also left Fei Zhi Tu and the others deeply troubled.

With him, the old woman and the old man fighting together, they could just about hold even against the remaining cloud beasts and keep from being defeated, but if another Ninth-Tier demonic beast appeared they could not predict how the situation would unfold.

Wen clearly perceived this as well, but bound as he was to protect Cai He and Du Sisi he dared not leave their sides even if he wanted to help; should anything happen to them there would be no one left to resolve the formation.

Besides, with so many clouds about, even if they expended every last effort to slay this newly appearing cloud beast there would likely be more to follow.

It was as if the intent was to wear people down to death within the formation.

Only then did everyone understand the sinister intent of the array’s layer — to show a sliver of hope, then mercilessly snuff it out. It was truly venomous.

While the Wen-family martial artist’s face flickered with uncertainty, Yang Kai had already pointed a finger and commanded the Artifact Spirit to charge the cloud beast; turning to Lian Guang he smiled and said, “Brother Lian, how about we cooperate to hold it? From the looks of it we can’t keep killing them — only stall for time.”

“No need for you to remind me of that!” Lian Guang replied coldly, directing several of his puppets to surge forward.
