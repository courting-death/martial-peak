## Chapter 587 — Ancestors of the Yang Family

The spirit bodies of these elderly and frail masters, all with white hair and signs of old age, scrutinized Yang Kai with great interest. Their expressions varied—some showed curiosity, others appeared gloomy, and a few even wore sinister grins, exuding a dangerous aura.

"How many years has it been?" Suddenly, a voice echoed. "Since that brat named Yang Yinghao last entered here, it’s been nearly twenty years, right?"

"Exactly twenty years!" someone answered.

"Twenty years—a mere blink of an eye."

"Just twenty years and someone else has come in again? Has Yang Yinghao died? That can’t be—if he had died, his spirit body should have arrived here. Did he die outside?"

"Heh heh, I told you that brat wasn’t cut out to be the Family Head. Looks like I was right."

"This kid isn’t any good either. Look how young he is; he hasn't even grown all his hair, how could he get in?"

"Ah, the Yang Family is going downhill, letting such a young kid become the Family Head. What a disgrace!"

"Hey, you little punk! Are you even from the Yang Family? Answer honestly! If you dare deceive us, you’ll beg for death but won’t find it!"

Shouts came from all directions. These white-haired spirit bodies each voiced their opinions, bickering loudly as if they hadn’t communicated with anyone for many years. Now, having caught the spirit body of a living person, they talked incessantly.

Yang Kai remained silent, observing coldly. Thoughts whirled in his mind, and slowly he began to understand the situation he faced.

"Cough, not speaking? Could he be mute?"

"I don’t think he’s from the Yang Family! Let’s just devour him, heh heh."

"If he’s not from the Yang Family, he wouldn’t be able to enter here. The Four Sacred Beast statues require the bloodline of the Yang Family to open."

"This kid shows no sign of panic at all, quite composed. When Yang Yinghao came here, he was startled by us."

"Yang Yinghao, humph, a good-for-nothing. I bet no one even knows where he died now."

"Shut up, all of you!" An angry shout rang out, and the many spirit bodies immediately fell silent.

Following the sound, Yang Kai looked and saw an elderly woman with white hair yet a youthful face, leaning on a cane, floating not far from him. Her eyes fixed on him with a commanding gaze.

It was clear this old woman had been a beauty in her youth and undoubtedly a strong-willed woman. Her seniority among these spirit bodies was evidently high; otherwise, her single angry roar wouldn’t have silenced the others.

Turning his body, Yang Kai faced her and cupped his fists: "Ninth ranked direct disciple of the Yang Family, Yang Kai, pays respects to the esteemed ancestors."

A look of surprise flashed across the old woman’s eyes. "You know that we are the ancestors of the Yang Family?"

"I guessed as much," Yang Kai nodded gently.

The old woman gave him an approving glance. "Not bad, your vision is decent, better than Yang Yinghao. When he came in, I had to explain things to him at length. What happened to Yang Yinghao? Is he dead already?"

"Uncle is still standing strong. It was he who opened this place and allowed me to enter," Yang Kai replied solemnly.

"Hmm." The old woman nodded lightly. "Do you know what this place is?"

"Uncle said it was the highest secret of the Yang Family," Yang Kai smiled wryly. "From where I stand, this should be where the Divine Senses of the Yang Family ancestors gather after death."

Everyone present was deeply moved, their gazes shining strangely as they fixed on Yang Kai.

"How could you tell?"

"Damn it, it must be that scoundrel Yang Yinghao who told him. I told him it was okay to bring someone here, but don’t say anything. Let us speak for ourselves. Such a rare chance to talk to a living spirit body, and he ruins it—damn, I want to rise from the grave and kill that little bastard!"

"Master, calm your anger!"

"Yeah, your bones are probably ground to dust by now, how could you rise from the grave?"

These folks seemed to have gone many years without speaking, but upon seeing Yang Kai, they all got excited, chattering non-stop.

The old woman glared sharply at them, and they hurriedly fell silent.

"Indeed, as you said, this place is where the Divine Senses of the Yang Family ancestors gather after death. The spirit bodies here belonged to the Grand Elders of the Yang Family in their lifetime!" The old woman tapped her cane and spoke sternly, "I am Yang Yi, Second Generation Grand Elder of the Yang Family."

Yang Kai was slightly moved. The second generation of the Yang Family—this dated back countless years.

"The Yang Family’s Divine Roaming Realm and beyond experts, upon sensing their time approaching, come to the Divine Root Hall and embed their Divine Sense into the Four Sacred Beast statues, preserving their lifetime’s worth of experience for future generations to draw upon. Over countless years, this has culminated in the scale you see now."

Turning his head to scan the area, Yang Kai roughly counted—there were at least forty or fifty spirit bodies of Transcendent Realm masters gathered here.

Such a vast number and wealth of resources—for one to fully absorb, the benefits would be immense.

"Only the Family Head of the Yang Family may enter here and benefit from our spirit bodies. With our experience, anyone can ascend beyond the Divine Roaming Realm so long as their strength is sufficient, and will not face bottlenecks. Do you understand this?"

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Gaining their insights, before advancing to Transcendent Realm, there should indeed be no bottleneck—if the individual’s strength kept up, breakthroughs would come smoothly.

Yang Yi continued, "Since you were sent here by Yang Yinghao, that means you are this generation’s Family Head. We have long since passed, so we need not concern ourselves with the current fate of the Yang Family. However, I must ask, why would a young man like you take the role of Family Head? What qualifications do you have?"

"What qualifications?" Yang Kai’s expression became peculiar. He thought for a moment and said, "I am not yet nineteen years old, yet I have reached Divine Roaming Realm, Fifth Stage, with twenty-seven elite Transcendent Realm warriors under my command. Is that enough qualification?"

"I can sense your cultivation,” Yang Yi said, “Your Divine Sense power is something unheard of to us. But about these Transcendent Realm warriors you speak of—what does that mean?" Yang Yi frowned, perplexed. The others also looked at Yang Kai in confusion.

Yang Kai was surprised. He suddenly remembered that the realm of Transcendent Realm was only known to the top experts in his residence. The ancestors of the Yang Family here probably never heard of it.

"The Transcendent Realm... is what you call beyond the Divine Roaming Realm," Yang Kai explained.

"So the world has a name for this realm," Yang Yi nodded with envy. Their understanding of beyond the Divine Roaming Realm was very vague.

"Twenty-seven beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?" someone exclaimed, disbelief on their face as they looked at Yang Kai, laughing, "Kid, lying comes with a price."

Others also showed amused expressions, thinking Yang Kai was boasting.

“Do I have any need to lie to the dead?” Yang Kai calmly swept his gaze around.

Their expressions gradually subdued as they realized this might actually be true.

Yet having twenty-seven beyond the Divine Roaming Realm warriors under his command was still a hard number to accept. That was a tremendous figure.

"Regardless of the truth of your words, if you want to benefit from us, you must show some skill," Yang Yi sneered.

"Please, honored elder, enlighten me."

"The Yang Family labored much to create the Four Sacred Beast statues in the second generation, intending to leave experiences for later generations. Over these years, we have done the same. Every visitor here has gained greatly. But... too much time has passed," Yang Yi's expression grew pained. "I cannot even recall how many years I have been trapped here. After such a long, boundless, silent, and void existence, anyone would develop feelings of unease and panic. Our wills and intentions have twisted through the long ages."

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai frowned and suddenly noticed that the spirit bodies gathered around him had changed their aura.

They all emitted a sinister and terrifying presence, eyeing him like ferocious beasts gazing upon a delicious meal.

"Yang Yinghao should have warned you, entering this place is perilous, and that danger comes from us!" Yang Yi said coldly. "Our greatest wish now is to leave this place, and you are the best vessel!"

"You want to usurp my body?" Yang Kai was shocked.

"This is an instinct born from centuries trapped here. Though we suppress it, you must be wary," Yang Yi warned loudly. "Once you enter, either you gain our experience and exit safely, or one of us will swallow your spirit, take over your body, and live in your stead."

Yang Kai looked around and indeed, as Yang Yi said, these spirit bodies of the Yang Family ancestors stared at him expectantly, as if wanting to devour his Divine Sense. Yet each struggled to suppress this instinct—the desire to strike was restrained.

The intensity varied—those trapped longer were more desperate and hungry, while those newer to this state showed only faint signs.

"Over these years, many spirit bodies have lost their consciousness, becoming wild, mindless energy. We have destroyed them together. This is also the fate that awaits us," Yang Yi said.

"How tragic," Yang Kai said with some pity.

Sensing the meaning in his eyes, everyone was silently astonished.

Every person who comes here has either been ecstatic or terrified, but no one ever pitied them.

Yang Kai was the first.

The grimness on Yang Yi’s face softened as she gazed fixedly at him. After a long moment, she said, "Whether tragic or not, this is our choice. Your judgment means nothing. If you do not unexpectedly die elsewhere, your spirit body will eventually join here, leaving your experiences for future generations."

"It won’t," Yang Kai shook his head slowly, his expression firm. "But today, I will end your tragic fate."
