## Chapter 112 — Constant Defeats

“Just consider it so,” Yang Kai smiled without denial, looking at him. “Is it truly only because of Hu Mei’er that you want to kill me?”

Long Hui’s expression was frivolous and disdainful. “Otherwise, do you think this young master has nothing better to do than come all this way just to deal with you?”

Yang Kai frowned. “But I have no deep connection with Hu Mei’er; we have only met a few times.”

“Hmph, perhaps you have no feelings for her, but that wretched woman feels very differently about you!” Long Hui’s face darkened with anger. “She even dared to defy my grandfather for your sake! She has never done such a thing before, nor ever gone to such lengths for any man! Who do you think you are, daring to set your sights on my woman?”

“Your grandfather…” A cold gleam flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes as he recalled the unreasonable strike from Long Zaitian. Had it not been for his Proud Bone Golden Body breaking free from the restraint, he might have already perished.

“There is one more question,” Yang Kai said coldly. “How did you know I left Lingxiao Pavilion?”

Since they had been able to track him all the way here, they must have set out shortly after his departure from Lingxiao Pavilion; otherwise, his trail would have been lost. In other words, someone had been watching him the moment he left.

Long Hui chuckled lightly. “Naturally, someone tipped me off.”

Just as expected!

“As for who gave me the tip, this young master does not know. But I imagine you know well whom you have offended!” Long Hui looked at Yang Kai with contempt, as if gazing upon a dead man. He spoke without reservation, revealing all he knew and did not know. “As for that Nu Lang, that was unexpected. I only discovered their trail in the small town at the foot of the mountain.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. Long Hui had no reason to deceive him. Since he said so, it must be true. Nu Lang had likely only stumbled upon his pursuit by chance and need not be dwelled upon further. Besides, Nu Lang was already dead.

“This young master has fulfilled your wish. Now, die!” Long Hui sneered, his figure flickering as he rapidly closed the distance to Yang Kai. His eyes gleamed with excitement as the Primordial Qi of the first stage of the Qi Movement Realm surged through him, his fists striking fiercely.

With each punch, a feather-like attack shot forth from the fist’s edge.

Feather Burst! A Middle-Level Earth-Grade martial technique!

As the grandson of Long Zaitian, Long Hui’s status was not low, and the martial skills he cultivated were naturally no ordinary fare. Though he was also at the first stage of the Qi Movement Realm, his true strength far exceeded that of Nu Lang at the same realm.

Long Hui was not merely a lustful playboy; to Yang Kai now, he was a formidable opponent.

The feather-like attacks came swiftly, forcing Yang Kai to dodge hurriedly, causing Long Hui’s strikes to miss entirely. A flicker of surprise crossed Long Hui’s eyes.

He had thought that Yang Kai, at the fourth stage of the Open Origin Realm, would not be able to evade his killing moves.

The next moment, a fierce and violent wave of Primordial Qi suddenly burst from Yang Kai’s body. Sensing the dense fluctuation, Long Hui’s expression changed.

This was no mere fourth stage of the Open Origin Realm; it was clearly the peak of the Open Origin Realm. The intensity of the wave rivaled his own.

The surprise lasted only an instant before Long Hui charged beside Yang Kai, Primordial Qi surging on his fist, delivering a brutal downward punch.

Yang Kai dodged no more; the punch crashed into the ground with a tremendous roar, dust billowing as a sizable crater formed.

Before Long Hui could recover, Yang Kai’s body suddenly darted back, his knee raised high, thrusting fiercely toward Long Hui’s chin.

Long Hui reacted swiftly, forming a palm with one hand to block under his chin, pressing downward.

The knee struck the palm’s center, both releasing bursts of Primordial Qi. Yang Kai staggered, and Long Hui was thrown backward, using the momentum to deflect the attack.

After a brief exchange, both stood firm once more.

Long Hui appraised Yang Kai from head to toe, narrowing his eyes. “So you have been hiding your strength all along! But even so, you are no match for me!”

Before he finished, Long Hui’s figure blurred, golden light flashing beneath his feet. In an instant, he appeared behind Yang Kai.

Golden Rainbow Step! Another Middle-Level Earth-Grade martial art.

Using this swift footwork, Long Hui finally reached Yang Kai’s blind spot. Primordial Qi surged at his fingertip as he jabbed toward the back of Yang Kai’s head, clearly aiming to kill with a single strike.

At the critical moment between life and death, Yang Kai sensed the wind behind his head and hurriedly tilted it aside. The finger grazed his cheek, the sharp Primordial Qi carving a bloody scar.

Yang Kai spun around, a drop of Yang Liquid appearing at his fingertip. In the next moment, it transformed into a blood-red blade, thin as a cicada’s wing, slashing fiercely at the nearby Long Hui.

This was a formidable foe! Yang Kai dared not hold back; any carelessness could cost him his life!

The blade sliced through Long Hui’s body, cleaving him in two, but Yang Kai showed no joy, for he could feel no solid impact. What he had cut was merely Long Hui’s afterimage.

The opponent’s footwork was exceedingly profound!

“Good reflexes!” Long Hui’s voice came from over ten zhang away, watching Yang Kai at leisure.

Yang Kai flicked his hand sharply, sending the blood-red blade flying out.

Long Hui did not linger, dodging again with Golden Rainbow Step, watching Yang Kai like a cat playing with a mouse, a trace of disdainful mockery on his face.

Silently, only the unyielding determination and fierce fighting spirit in Yang Kai’s eyes remained. His steps flew as he charged before Long Hui, throwing a punch.

It was futile! Long Hui had already appeared on the other side.

“Hmph, you think you can defeat me with that snail’s pace? Overestimating yourself!” Long Hui’s mouth never rested, mocking relentlessly.

He believed that with Golden Rainbow Step, he was invincible. His opponent could not touch him, so how could he lose? His fierce attacks would only waste Yang Kai’s Primordial Qi. When Yang Kai was nearly exhausted, Long Hui would strike a killing blow.

Thus, Long Hui resolved to stall, waiting for the right moment to win with minimal cost.

“Slow, far too slow…”

“If you cannot kill me, then this young master will gladly take your female companion.”

“What does she look like, I wonder? I am eager to hear the screams she makes when trampled upon!”

“Hahaha, this young master loves nothing more than the sound of a woman’s unwilling cries. Just imagine the scene—will it not pain your heart?”
