## Chapter 483 — Has He Gone Mad?

“Young Master will remain in Fengshen Hall for the time being,” Ying Jiu reported truthfully.

“Fengshen Hall?” Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but part her rosy lips, disbelief flooding her voice.

Fengshen Hall was no stranger to her; it was guarded by eight cultivators beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, a fact known to everyone in War City.

Yet, without the summons of those eight, no one could enter.

What was Yang Kai doing in Fengshen Hall? Could it be that those eight intended to instruct him?

Qiu Yimeng's mind raced with speculation, but soon joy surfaced on her face as she silently celebrated Yang Kai’s fortune. She lightly nodded, “I understand.”

Since he was staying in Fengshen Hall, his safety was absolutely guaranteed.

After some thought, she asked again, “Then what about tomorrow night...?”

“The Young Master said everything is to be conducted under your command.”

Qiu Yimeng clenched her teeth and cursed, “That damn man, always shirking responsibility.”

“The message has been delivered. Ying Jiu takes his leave.” Upon finishing, Ying Jiu vanished without a trace.

Back in her chamber, Qiu Yimeng was wide awake. She immediately took out pen and paper, meticulously enumerating the forces and number of experts on both sides, contemplating all possible scenarios.

At dawn, many martial artists emerged from their seclusion, mind and Primordial Qi refreshed, testing the power of their newly refined treasures.

The treasures snatched from Po Jing Lake had all been distributed by Qiu Yimeng. These days, everyone had been refining their treasures, and only today were they mostly finished.

Having stayed up all night, Qiu Yimeng hurried to summon the leading figures of the major factions to discuss the coming battle.

She didn’t reveal too many details, only instructing those named to prepare. There would be action tonight.

Hearing this, everyone rubbed their hands eagerly, spirits high.

“Both of you, Hu sisters, come along too,” Qiu Yimeng said with a smile, looking at Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er.

Hu Jiao’er nodded, “Very well.”

Knowing that few from Blood Battle Gang had come this time, and even fewer experts, this deployment clearly intended to give Blood Battle Gang a chance for merit.

Leng Shan, however, hesitated, “This time, Ghost King Valley probably won’t participate. Our entire group has a martial skill temporarily unusable.”

“Then please remain to guard your residence,” Qiu Yimeng arranged suitably.

“Thank you,” Leng Shan responded with gratitude.

After some time, all factions were placed—some staying behind, others mobilizing. Qiu Yimeng had considered everyone’s feelings carefully, leaving all content.

Once dismissed, everyone returned to rest and conserve energy. Only the coming night remained to be awaited.

Time flew by, night draping the world.

Just days after the battle to seize treasures at Po Jing Lake, no one expected a large-scale mobilization this very night.

Outside Yang Wei’s mansion, Meng Shanyi stood by the door, softly knocking. “Eldest Young Master, they have already moved.”

The door opened, and Yang Wei stepped out, eyes gleaming with sharp light, nodding slightly. “We move as well.”

“Eldest Young Master… I suddenly feel something isn’t right.”

“What is it?”

“Ninth Young Master moves to attack Fifth Young Master. We are to restrain Second Young Master. But what of Sixth and Seventh Young Masters? If they hear the news, won’t they seize the opportunity to strike?”

“If they’re not fools, certainly they will,” Yang Wei nodded thoughtfully.

“What about Ninth Young Master’s side?” Meng Shanyi’s expression brightened. “If that’s so, even if Ninth Young Master takes down Fifth Young Master, he’ll have fires at home.”

Yang Wei glanced strangely at Meng Shanyi and laughed, “Shanyi, it seems you’re eager to see this. You fear Ninth Brother?”

Meng Shanyi looked embarrassed but solemnly nodded, asking in a low voice, “Eldest Young Master, don’t you worry at all?”

“What use is worry? I’ve done all I can. If truly outmatched, I have nothing to say.” Yang Wei shook his head slowly, calm as ever. “If Ninth Brother moves quickly enough tonight, he can secure his rear before Sixth and Seventh Brothers react. If he’s slow... losses are inevitable.”

Meng Shanyi paused, carefully pondering Yang Wei’s words. It became clear that even if Yang Kai was slow, only his rear would suffer damage—not a total defeat.

The Eldest Young Master held Ninth Brother in high regard.

Yet, with Ying Jiu and that Bone Shield as trump cards, capturing Yang Kang quickly was not impossible.

The calm, serene night seemed quietly tinged with tension.

At Yang Kang’s residence, Yang Kang was deeply focused on refining his newly acquired Mystery-Grade treasure of lower rank. The True Essence he invested these past days had borne fruit; in another five or six days, he could fully incorporate this treasure, elevating his strength considerably.

With a Mystery-Grade treasure in hand, he dared to take on Divine Roaming Realm experts. The treasure war at Po Jing Lake had fundamentally uplifted the power of several Yang brothers.

As he labored, the closed door suddenly burst open.

Startled, Yang Kang barely grasped what was happening when a thin shadow flashed, two gleaming daggers slicing through the darkness toward him.

His skin tightened as an instinctive sense of danger swept over him.

“Fifth Young Master, beware!” Tang Yuxian’s sharp warning echoed as a delicate soul technique burst forth into the dark.

The slender figure did not directly attack Yang Kang but swiftly retreated to the doorway.

Under moonlight, Yang Kang clearly saw the visitor’s face and instantly felt a chill travel down his spine, scalp tingling.

“Ying Jiu!”

Ying Jiu grinned broadly, his figure gradually fading until gone.

Moments later, Tang Yuxian appeared beside Yang Kang, asking with concern, “Fifth Young Master, are you alright?”

Yang Kang stood stunned a long while before dispelling his fear, slowly shaking his head. “I’m fine. Luckily, Yuxian your timely alert blocked him.”

If not for Tang Yuxian’s soul technique, Ying Jiu’s strength would have captured Yang Kang long ago.

This shadowy Blood Servant’s stealth assassination tactics were terrifying beyond measure, impossible to guard against.

Yet why had Ying Jiu stopped after one attempt? His departing smile was puzzling.

Suddenly enlightened, Yang Kang slapped his thigh. “Too much insolence!”

Blood Servants were not allowed to take the initiative in the succession war, only defensive. So even if Yang Kang had confronted Ying Jiu, Ying Jiu would not have harmed him.

His attack was purely a show, not real intent. Rather, it was his own reaction that was laughable.

“How is Ying Jiu safe?” Tang Yuxian frowned, pondering.

During the Po Jing Lake treasure battle, Tu Feng brought by Yang Kang had been cursed with the Sealing Yuan Curse and was still sealed. Yet Ying Jiu, equally cursed, appeared here freely.

“Ninth Brother!” Yang Kang’s expression darkened, his hatred for Yang Kai burning, paying no mind to Ying Jiu for the moment.

Suddenly, Tang Yuxian’s face changed, her delicate features paling. “Fifth Young Master, many are coming!”

“What?” Yang Kang was shocked. “Who is coming?”

“I sense Xiao Shun’s aura and other experts from Young Master’s mansion. It seems... Young Master intends to attack here.”

“Has he lost his mind?” Yang Kang could no longer sit still. Rising, he hurried outside.

What nerve does Ninth Brother have at this moment? No one had recovered from the Po Jing Lake losses, and they were still refining treasures. Why shirk refinement and do a self-defeating thing now?

Fighting now wastes his treasure refining time and theirs, what benefit could there be?

Even if the two brothers disliked each other, no need to target each other so.

They would hold the advantage once treasures were fully refined.

As he strode out, shouts of battle reached his ears, and energy fluctuations slammed into him. Yang Kang realized Yang Kai truly meant war.

This was no bluff with false maneuvers.

As the attackers arrived, not a word of courtesy was exchanged; the assault began immediately.

Above the mansion, nearly two hundred people hovered in the air, centered on Qiu Yimeng.

Excluding the special factions Yao Wang Valley and Baoqi Sect, fourteen factions currently supported Yang Kai.

This mobilization involved eight of them besides the Qiu and Huo families—Blood Battle Gang, Dong Family, Ziwei Valley, Wen Xin Palace, Tianyuan City, Duanmu Family, among others.

Qiu Family’s strength was modest; Autumn Rain Hall lacked powerful experts.

Huo Family had only two Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage experts; Blood Battle Gang had few experts at this level. Most other factions boasted four or five Divine Roaming experts.

Overall strength and numbers paled significantly beside Yang Kang’s experts.

Yet Qiu Yimeng remained confident.

She had brought two Blood Servants along, plus a sinister and mysterious expert—Di Mo.

Qiu Yimeng didn’t know how powerful Di Mo truly was but was certain he was stronger than the Blood Servants.

With these three in play, capturing Yang Kang’s mansion was only a matter of time.

Thus, upon arrival, Qiu Yimeng ordered the attack without greeting.

Yang Kang’s martial artists were caught utterly unprepared. Amid the bursts of martial skills and treasure light, chaos erupted; in mere moments, over a dozen fell.

Recovering, they scrambled to defend and counterattack, each showing signs of panic and confusion.

Since Yang Kang had not appeared, they lacked a central figure; relying on Gao Rangfeng from the Gao Family was insufficient to coordinate.

“Miss Qiu, the five of us request to join the battle!” A Duanmu Family expert said grimly, killing intent shining from his face.
