## Chapter 2447 — Regret

Qi Hai continued, "Which of the Great Emperor's treasures isn't a sentient artifact? The Mountain and River Bell was the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor's life-bound Imperial Treasure and possesses its own spirit. If it chooses you as its master, it will come to you of its own accord without the need for refining. But if it looks down on you, even if you are in the Emperor Realm, you won't be able to refine it at all."

The young man's eyes lit up at these words and he asked eagerly, "Brother Qi, does that mean if we have the fortune, any of us could become the master of the Mountain and River Bell?"

Qi Hai replied coldly, "First, you need to have that fortune!"

The young man laughed loudly and said proudly, "I may not be confident in anything else, but I have absolute faith in my luck. Since the Mountain and River Bell is already sentient, it might just choose me as the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor's successor, inheriting the Great Emperor's mantle!"

Laughing fanatically, he turned and strode toward the Mountain and River Bell.

Everyone was stunned, realizing that this young man surnamed Zhang was going to try to be chosen by the Mountain and River Bell! For a moment, all eyes watched him curiously, wanting to see what would happen.

A few hesitated but held back to watch.

Qi Hai stared at the young man's back, sneering repeatedly, as if mocking his overconfidence.

Under everyone's gaze, the young man walked as if no one else was present, quickly reaching a hundred zhang from the bell-shaped mountain. Perhaps the smooth progress boosted his confidence, and his face lit up with joy as he quickened his pace.

Soon, he was only fifty zhang away from the mountain, and the distance was closing fast.

At this point, all the onlookers couldn't help but feel anxious and conflicted. They worried that this guy might really have heaven-defying luck and claim the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor's life-bound Imperial Treasure. If that happened, he might one day become another Origin Cauldron Great Emperor.

After another ten breaths, the young man reached the foot of the mountain without encountering the slightest obstacle or danger. It was so smooth it was almost unbelievable. Even Qi Hai, who had been sneering, now looked much gloomier.

Everyone wondered if this guy was truly favored by destiny.

The young man couldn't help but laugh, "After tens of thousands of years, you've waited long enough. Today, I, Zhang, have come to take you away. In the future, we'll roam the Star Realm together and bring glory to the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor's name. I won't let your brilliance be buried!"

Saying this, he reached out his hand.

Light flickered within the mountain, as if responding to his words.

This greatly boosted the young man's confidence. Without hesitation, he pressed his palm against the mountain, sending his mind to connect with the Mountain and River Bell's Artifact Spirit.

At that moment, a sudden change occurred.

The bell-shaped mountain suddenly trembled, emitting a thunderous hum. The mountain shattered instantly, sending rocks flying in all directions.

At the same time, a gigantic bell-shaped Secret Treasure appeared before everyone. The ancient bell radiated an aura of antiquity, as if it had crossed over from tens of thousands of years ago.

Runes flowed endlessly across the bell's surface, mysterious and unfathomable.

Suddenly, a brilliant light flared, and a deep bell toll rang out.

"Wong..."

It was as if the world itself was being torn apart, the heavens and earth reversed, mountains and rivers suppressed. The bell's sound swept out in all directions, a visible wave forming an unstoppable tide of energy. Everyone's face changed as they hurriedly defended themselves.

The moment the bell rang, the young man closest to the Bell was struck as if by a mountain. He was sent flying like a paper kite, blood spraying in midair, mixed with fragments of his organs. The aura of the Dao Origin Realm faded rapidly, and his life was snuffed out in an instant.

Before he even hit the ground, he was already dead.

Crash...

The aftershocks of the sound wave continued to spread, the force churning up the earth as if the end of the world had come.

Only after ten breaths did everything gradually calm down.

Dozens of Dao Origin Realm cultivators were left battered and miserable. Some were even buried in the dirt, struggling to climb out. Looking around, everyone was shocked and speechless.

In their shock, no one even thought to snatch the Star Seal left behind by the dead young man.

"Cough, cough..." Qi Hai coughed a few times, patted the dust off himself, and looked at the dead young man, saying blandly, "Looks like you didn't have the fortune."

Everyone was silent.

As expected of a Great Emperor's treasure, the Mountain and River Bell's power was simply unbelievable. The young man had only touched it, yet it caused such a huge commotion. If someone really refined it, how terrifying would its power be?

And this definitely wasn't the Mountain and River Bell's true power. After all, it had been left here for tens of thousands of years, so its power must have diminished. That earlier outburst probably wasn't even half of its true strength.

So, despite the young man's tragic example, everyone's desire only burned hotter.

Moreover, after the recent upheaval, the Mountain and River Bell—once hidden within the mountain—was now fully revealed in all its glory. This Imperial Treasure stood over ten zhang tall, looming like a true small mountain upon the earth. Its surface shimmered with flowing Imperial Aura and countless mysterious runes, dazzling the eyes of all who gazed upon it. Every cultivator fixed their attention on this wondrous artifact, hoping to glean some hidden secret from its profound patterns.

But now, no one dared approach it lightly. So, even though everyone was burning with desire, the scene was eerily deadlocked, as if all were secretly praying the Artifact Spirit would choose them.

Just then, another hum rang out.

Everyone's face changed in confusion, for no one had touched the Mountain and River Bell—why was it releasing its power again?

With prior experience, everyone instinctively activated their Origin Qi and summoned their Secret Treasures for protection.

But the expected shockwave didn't come. Instead, something astonishing happened.

The Mountain and River Bell trembled, then suddenly shot into the sky as a streak of light.

In an instant, everyone was dumbfounded.

No one knew who reacted first, but someone shouted, "Chase it!"

As soon as the words fell, that person took the lead and gave chase.

Having finally discovered a Great Emperor's treasure, how could they let it slip away? So, after that person moved, dozens of cultivators soared into the air, turning into streaks of color as they chased after the Mountain and River Bell.

Yang Kai was no exception.

He already had many Imperial Treasures, and had even given one each to Liu Yan, Hua Jie, and his Incarnation. But who would ever have too many Imperial Treasures? Having witnessed the Mountain and River Bell's immense power, he was even more interested. Its might seemed even greater than the Extinction Thunder Bead's.

He believed Qi Hai was right—without some fortune, it was impossible to claim an Imperial Treasure, especially one that was sentient. To claim it, you first had to gain the Artifact Spirit's approval.

As long as he could gain the Artifact Spirit's approval, claiming the Mountain and River Bell would be much easier.

Having cultivated all this way, Yang Kai had experienced countless opportunities. In terms of luck, he was confident he was second to none, so he still held some hope of claiming the Mountain and River Bell.

Besides, Yin Lesheng, whom he was looking for, had also chased after the Mountain and River Bell, so Yang Kai couldn't just let him go.

But just as he shot forward, a strange feeling suddenly welled up from deep within. It was hard to describe, but it left him uneasy.

The odd sensation was elusive—when he tried to focus on it, it vanished without a trace.

And the faster Yang Kai flew, the stronger the feeling became!

It was as if... as if leaving this place would leave him with immense regret!

Yang Kai frowned and abruptly stopped.

The Mountain and River Bell was tempting, but unless he figured out this feeling, he had no mind to fight for it.

A figure shot over from behind, clearly also chasing the Mountain and River Bell. Yang Kai looked and saw it was Lan He.

Seeing him stop, Lan He glanced at him in surprise, but she clearly had no intention of paying him any mind. After a glance, she prepared to fly past him.

As they passed, Yang Kai suddenly moved, reaching out to tap Lan He's shoulder.

Lan He's face changed, and she twisted away, retreating rapidly. Though she moved quickly, Yang Kai still brushed her clothes.

"What are you doing!" Lan He shouted angrily, her face cold. At the same time, she swept her Divine Sense over the spot Yang Kai had touched, trying to figure out what he'd done.

But to her disappointment, no matter how she checked, she found nothing at all.

Yang Kai smiled, "It's nothing, don't be nervous. I just wanted to advise you not to chase after it. With so many people going, you won't be able to get it."

"Whether I can get it or not, what does that have to do with you!" Lan He said irritably. She thought this guy was really something—he meddled so much for someone he barely knew. Who knew what he was thinking?

Yang Kai shrugged, "Just giving you some advice. What you do is up to you, Miss Lan He."

Lan He stared at him for a long moment before saying, "You're crazy!"

With that, she turned and flew toward the starry sky.

If not for the urgency, she would have taught Yang Kai a lesson. From the first time they'd met, he'd been a bit improper, and now he dared to reach out to her so casually. It was simply outrageous.

But with her mind set on the Mountain and River Bell, she had no mood to argue with Yang Kai.

Still, after this, her opinion of Yang Kai had hit rock bottom.

Watching her receding figure, Yang Kai could only rub his nose helplessly. He hadn't meant to target Lan He specifically—she just happened to be behind him. If it had been anyone else, he would have done the same.
