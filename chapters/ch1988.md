## Chapter 1988 — The Vile Liar

Fenglin City, inside Yang Kai's cavehouse.

Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi sat across from each other at the table.

After leaving the black market, Yang Kai had hurriedly escorted Mo Xiaoqi back here, all the while deliberately checking whether anyone was following them and even taking a slightly longer route.

Only after ensuring it was safe did they return to the cavehouse.

"Eldest Brother Yang, you are amazing!" Mo Xiaoqi cupped her cheeks with both hands, her face full of infatuation, bright eyes gazing at Yang Kai, lavishly showing her admiration and reverence. "You scared those hateful guys off with just a few words — how did you do it?"

Yang Kai let out an awkward, dry chuckle.

If anyone else had asked him that, Yang Kai would have suspected they were teasing him, but coming from Mo Xiaoqi it was genuine praise.

"They simply imagined things." Yang Kai replied casually to brush it off.

The whole matter earlier had indeed been the Fei Sheng Palace people reading too much into it, and it was also a product of the current situation in Fenglin City. If Fenglin City had not been such a chaotic place, whether Yang Kai's words would have worked was another question.

Right now many forces had sent people into Fenglin City; Fei Sheng Palace, though not weak, was by no means the top, so Liu Yizhi naturally had his reservations.

"Never mind that—Xiaoqi, how did you end up here?" Yang Kai changed the subject.

"I've been here all along." Mo Xiaoqi looked at him puzzled, not understanding why he asked. "By the way, my rented cavehouse is very close to yours, just not far away. Why haven't I seen you before?"

"I hadn't been living on this side before; I only returned today."

"Oh."

"Actually I wanted to ask — how did you escape from Yuqing Mountain last time?" Yang Kai asked Mo Xiaoqi with a face full of suspicion.

After emerging from the Xuan Realm Pearl, he had specifically looked for Mo Xiaoqi and found no trace; he had thought she was surely dead, reduced to ashes.

He had not expected to see her again today in Fenglin City.

"That day... I escaped using this." Mo Xiaoqi said as she produced an item from her Spatial Ring and placed it in front of Yang Kai.

"This is..." Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as he stared at the table — a piece of beast-hide radiating an extremely strange fluctuation of energy.

The energy ripple was one Yang Kai was very familiar with. It was unmistakably the fluctuation of Spatial Power.

The hide was only about two palms in size, and many intricate circuits and runes were carved across it, forming a wondrous pattern.

Yang Kai reached out and touched it, sensing it carefully.

After a long moment he was struck with horror: "This thing — does it perform spatial transfer?"

Mo Xiaoqi grinned and looked at Yang Kai: "Eldest Brother Yang truly cultivates Spatial Power. You could sense even this."

"You knew I cultivated Spatial Power?" Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

"Yes — when you fought in Yuqing Mountain you used Spatial Power, didn't you? I noticed back then, because the way you used your power felt somewhat like when Uncle Li fought."

"Uncle Li?"

"Uncle Li Wuyi. He cultivates Spatial Power too and is very skilled. He made this thing for me to use to save my life." Mo Xiaoqi showed no distrust toward Yang Kai, perhaps out of old habits or because Yang Kai had never harmed her.

As she spoke she explained, "Uncle Li said this thing can open a Void Passage at a critical moment, so it's perfect for escaping. I originally had two; I used one at Yuqing Mountain and now I only have this one left..."

Her words betrayed a hint of reluctance.

Could a formation carried on a single piece of animal hide actually open a Void Passage?

Yang Kai was utterly shocked on the spot.

Although his study and mastery of Spatial Power were remarkable, with his current ability he could never craft such an item; he could only use his own Spatial Power to teleport, and even that was easily disturbed.

If the surrounding heaven-and-earth energy became unstable, his teleportation could not perform well.

That was related to his strength, his grasp of Spatial Power, and the Heaven-and-Earth laws of the Star Realm. The Star Realm's laws were far denser than those of his native Star Domain, so Yang Kai's teleportation was severely suppressed here.

Yet Li Wuyi could make a treasure like the hide before him; evidently his attainment in Spatial Power was something Yang Kai could not approach.

"Eldest Brother Yang, I'm sorry." Mo Xiaoqi suddenly wore a guilty look and apologized.

"Why are you apologizing all of a sudden?" Yang Kai looked up at her.

"When things got dangerous last time, I wanted to bring you along, but Luan Feng's attack came too fast and I could only... only... I later tried to go back inside to find you, but I couldn't get deep enough. I thought you must have... died."

Yang Kai chuckled softly upon hearing that.

In that respect he and Mo Xiaoqi had thought the same — each presumed the other had perished under the World-Ending Black Flame — yet each had their own means of escape.

"Then how did you escape, Eldest Brother?" Mo Xiaoqi asked.

"I am adept at Spatial Power." Yang Kai lied offhandedly.

"Oh — Uncle Li once said people skilled in Spatial Power are first-rate at escaping." Mo Xiaoqi exclaimed as if enlightened.

Seeing her take it so seriously, Yang Kai felt an inexplicable pang of guilt...

Afterwards the two chatted casually.

By casual questioning, Yang Kai discovered Uncle Li Wuyi's cultivation level — astonishingly an Emperor Realm expert! He didn't pry into Mo Xiaoqi's origins; sometimes ignorance is safer.

Mo Xiaoqi's background was clearly extraordinary, Yang Kai understood that.

"Eldest Brother Yang, if you have nothing to do, come with me to look for a treasure?" Mo Xiaoqi suddenly suggested with renewed excitement.

"Treasure?"

"Yes, yes." Mo Xiaoqi nodded eagerly and produced a piece of beast-skin paper from her Spatial Ring. "I bought a treasure map today; the seller said it led to a treasure left by the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor — maybe it even contains the Heaven Devouring Battle Art."

"This thing... why does it look so familiar?" Yang Kai frowned, took the beast-skin paper and scrutinized it, then his face went blank.

"How many Source Crystals did you pay for this?" Yang Kai asked, looking up at Mo Xiaoqi.

"Seven thousand!" Mo Xiaoqi said proudly. "Not expensive, right? If it really leads to the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, we'd be rich."

"Blasted swindlers!" Yang Kai muttered under his breath.

"What did you say, Eldest Brother?"

"Nothing." Yang Kai cleared his throat, then, choosing his words, said earnestly: "Xiaoqi, when you're out and about, people are dangerous; not everyone is as gentle and kind as you. Always be careful."

"I know, Aunt Feng used to tell me that all the time." Mo Xiaoqi replied.

"In the Star Realm there are many who scheme and deceive, so words cannot always be trusted."

"I know that too."

"Sigh... this treasure map is fake." Yang Kai sighed and had to be blunt; expecting the girl to realize it herself was asking too much.

"How can that be? He swore up and down that this held the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor's treasure — one of the Ten Great Emperors of old!" Mo Xiaoqi stared at Yang Kai in disbelief, dazed. "Could an Emperor lie?"

"Whether an Emperor lies I don't know, but the one who sold you this certainly cheated you."

Mo Xiaoqi was taken aback and pondered awhile before a dawning comprehension lit her face; she cried out, "Detestable liar! How dare he fool me — I'll go find him!"

"Forget it, forget it — that person is surely gone; how will you find him in the vast sea of people?" Yang Kai hurried to stop her.

Mo Xiaoqi immediately pouted, stomping her foot and swinging her small fists: "I'm so furious — if I see him again I'll make him pay."

After hurling those threats she calmed somewhat, thought a bit, and pulled out seven or eight more treasure maps from her Spatial Ring. "Eldest Brother Yang, you look at these — are they real?"

Yang Kai looked over and couldn't help the corner of his mouth twitch.

"How about this one?" Mo Xiaoqi produced a black, glossy item — a Night Sky Stone that served no use other than ornamentation.

"Heh..." Yang Kai gave a dry chuckle.

"And this peerless manual?" Mo Xiaoqi tossed out another item.

Yang Kai glanced at it and his body stiffened.

It was a supposed peerless manual, its pages yellowed with age, the pages emblazoned with large characters — 'Peerless Manual!'

As if it feared people might not know it was a peerless manual.

But how naive must one be to be taken in so thoroughly by a single trip to the black market and buy so many useless things? If everyone were like Mo Xiaoqi, those swindlers would have long since grown rich.

Yang Kai's silence deeply disappointed Mo Xiaoqi, who buried her head in her chest as if shrouded by an invisible shadow.

Seeing her so crushed, Yang Kai sighed softly and intended to comfort her and teach her a lesson, but Mo Xiaoqi suddenly looked up with a mischievous smile and said, "This thing definitely can't be fake."

Saying that, she carefully took out an oval, pale-blue stone and placed it on the table.

Yang Kai, seeing her confidence, cast his Divine Sense over it but found no Spiritual Qi fluctuations — it looked just like an ordinary stone.

Oddly though, the stone's surface carried a strange force that blocked his Divine Sense from probing it.

"What is this?" Yang Kai frowned.

Mo Xiaoqi smiled mysteriously: "A beast egg!"
