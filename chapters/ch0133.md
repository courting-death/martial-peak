## Chapter 133 — Gathering Together

This place was originally tranquil, with only the distant laughter and splashing sounds of two girls breaking the silence.

When Yang Kai shouted, even though his voice was not loud, it seemed quite sudden.

As soon as his words fell, a violent splash echoed from the direction of the two girls, indicating they had suddenly plunged into the water. Nie Yong appeared to be greatly startled, jumping back a few steps like a frightened rabbit. He turned to glare fiercely at Yang Kai before swiftly retreating.

Before leaving, the resentment in his eyes was palpable, clearly indicating he had not expected Yang Kai to dare offend him.

“Coward!” Yang Kai scoffed.

If he were Nie Yong, with his whereabouts already exposed, he might as well charge forward a few steps; perhaps he could witness something marvelous and not leave empty-handed.

Before long, Lan Chudie and Du Yishuang returned, their hair dripping wet. Du Yishuang puffed her cheeks, a glint of coldness flashing in her eyes, while Lan Chudie calmly glanced at Yang Kai and said softly, “Thank you.”

“You're welcome.” Yang Kai replied nonchalantly.

As the three stood up and prepared to return, a sudden, intense wave of Yuan Qi fluctuations surged from a distance.

Turning their heads, they saw dazzling lights flashing in the distant sky, accompanied by the sounds of shouting and fighting. Soon after, a furious beast roar thundered into their ears.

The expressions of the three changed abruptly; this roar was clearly emitted by a beast.

How could there still be beasts in such a place?

Moreover, at this moment, it was evident that many people were engaged in battle with this beast.

With a rustle, Nie Yong and Zuo An, who had just fled, rushed back, their faces grave as they looked toward the source of the commotion.

Du Yishuang shot a hateful glance at Nie Yong, her eyes filled with undisguised disgust. Lan Chudie, however, said nothing about what had just happened, as if nothing had occurred, and instead asked, “Zuo An, can you hear anything?”

Zuo An had better hearing. Although everyone could hear some commotion from that direction, it was certainly not as clear as what he could discern.

“Over a hundred people!” Zuo An replied solemnly. “There are over a hundred people over there attacking a beast. From the noise it’s making, it’s likely around the sixth rank.”

Everyone’s expressions changed in unison; the sixth rank was equivalent to the Divine Roaming Realm!

Those who entered the Inheritance Celestial Cave were merely True Yuan Realm experts at best; how could they contend against a Divine Roaming Realm beast? Were these over a hundred people fools seeking death?

“The beast’s roar sounds weak.” Zuo An frowned. “It seems to have just awakened and should be related to the seal in this area.”

Several people suddenly understood.

The seal here had only recently been broken, and the beasts in this area had certainly been sealed for many years. Although they did not know why these beasts were still alive, they surely could not exert their original strength.

No wonder those over a hundred dared to attack it.

“The beast is injured!” Zuo An’s brow twitched.

Indeed, as his words fell, an angry and unwilling beast roar came from that direction. At the same time, the previous commotion suddenly quieted down, and the over a hundred people fell silent.

“What’s going on?” Lan Chudie asked anxiously.

“I don’t know.” Zuo An slowly shook his head. “Should we go take a look?”

Lan Chudie furrowed her brows, contemplating carefully. After a long while, she turned to the other four and said, “What do you all think? Personally, I believe we should go take a look. Since there are over a hundred people gathered there, they can’t all be True Yuan Realm and Separation and Union Realm cultivators; there should also be Qi Movement Realm disciples among them. If they can stay there, we can too. However, there will likely be danger; you all decide whether to go or not.”

“Of course we should go.” Nie Yong was the first to nod. After the embarrassing incident earlier, he felt uncomfortable staying with this small group and naturally wanted to seek out other senior brothers.

“I’ll go too.” Zuo An said quietly.

Lan Chudie looked at Yang Kai and Du Yishuang, both of whom nodded slightly.

“Then let’s go!”

The five quickly activated their movement techniques and rushed toward the source of the commotion.

About an hour later, the five finally encountered three other sects' disciples besides their own group.

In the distance, two groups were confronting each other, each numbering around fifty, nearly equal in strength. However, the light in the forest was too dim, and the five could not discern which sect the two groups belonged to.

After a moment, a familiar voice came from afar: “Fang Ziqi, is this all the skill your Fengyu Tower has? You think you can snatch something from me? You’re still too green!”

Upon hearing this voice, Nie Yong’s expression brightened with joy. “It’s Senior Brother Jie!”

Lan Chudie also revealed a faint smile, but Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

One of the groups was from Lingxiao Pavilion, but the leader was actually Jie Hongchen! This was not someone he wished to see.

Du Yishuang shared the same expression as Yang Kai. Du Yishuang was a disciple of Fengyu Tower, and Fang Ziqi, mentioned by Jie Hongchen, was the top expert of the younger generation from Fengyu Tower.

The five exchanged glances, and Du Yishuang discreetly distanced herself from Lan Chudie and the others. Although they had teamed up to explore and face challenges these past few days, now that their respective sects had appeared, it was only natural to gravitate toward their own sects. This way, they would become enemies.

Facing Jie Hongchen’s taunt, Fang Ziqi replied indifferently, “Jie Hongchen, I simply don’t want to fight you. You’ve just broken through to the True Yuan Realm; you’re not my opponent. Don’t humiliate yourself!”

“What did you say?” Jie Hongchen’s voice turned cold.

At that moment, many Lingxiao Pavilion disciples began to shout, urging Jie Hongchen to give Fang Ziqi a lesson, eager to stir up trouble.

“Hmph! Besides Su Yan, no one from Lingxiao Pavilion has caught my eye!” Fang Ziqi chuckled lightly, his attitude exceedingly arrogant.

“Are you looking for a fight with me?”

“If you’re willing, I’ll accompany you. However, if you lose in front of so many people, it might not look good for you.”

These words struck a nerve with Jie Hongchen. Although both he and Fang Ziqi were at the first level of the True Yuan Realm, one had just broken through while the other had been at this level for some time. In a real fight, he might not necessarily be the opponent.

Just as Jie Hongchen was caught in a dilemma, Nie Yong, who had just emerged from the forest, shouted, “Senior Brother Jie!”

Hearing the call, Jie Hongchen quickly turned to look, a hint of relaxation appearing on his face as he smiled, “Junior Brother Nie!”

“I finally found you!” Nie Yong exclaimed excitedly, his speed suddenly increasing as he broke away from the five-person group and rushed toward the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples.

The other four halted their steps. Du Yishuang and Zuo An were not from Lingxiao Pavilion, so they naturally would not go over. Yang Kai had enmity with Jie Hongchen and would not go either. As for Lan Chudie, she knew about the grievances between Yang Kai and Jie Hongchen and hesitated, glancing at Yang Kai.

“Yang Kai, I’m going over to Senior Brother Fang’s side. Thank you for these past few days.” Du Yishuang said softly.

“Mm, go ahead.” Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

“What about you, Zuo An? Are you coming with me or with Sister Lan?” Du Yishuang asked before leaving, as there were no Blood Battle Gang members here, making him seem somewhat homeless and isolated.

Zuo An replied quietly, “I’ll go with you.”

Though the Fengyu Tower side might not all be good people, after spending these days together, Zuo An knew that Du Yishuang was a kind-hearted girl. Rather than follow Lan Chudie, he preferred to stay with Du Yishuang.

At least she wouldn’t play any tricks.

Du Yishuang nodded, and the two of them headed toward the Fengyu Tower group together.

“We should go too.” Lan Chudie said.

Yang Kai did not respond, his eyes scanning the group from Lingxiao Pavilion. After a moment, he said, “You go; I won’t.”

He hadn’t seen Su Mu, nor had he spotted Su Yan or Xia Ningshang. This group was led by Jie Hongchen, and going over would only invite humiliation.

“Junior Brother, endure for a moment; the situation here is perilous, and you definitely can’t handle it alone.” Lan Chudie understood his concerns and gently advised.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, his expression resolute.

On the Lingxiao Pavilion side, Nie Yong’s arrival brought joy and laughter among many disciples, who greeted him warmly, clearly familiar with one another. Afterward, Nie Yong approached Jie Hongchen and whispered something, turning to glance at Yang Kai and Lan Chudie, a cold hatred appearing on his face.

From about twenty zhang away, Jie Hongchen looked at Yang Kai with a disdainful and triumphant expression.

On the other side, Fang Ziqi, unaware of the situation, urged, “Jie Hongchen, since you don’t want to fight me, let’s join forces to kill that beast first. As for the treasures guarded by that beast, we can discuss them later.”

Jie Hongchen glanced at him and smiled, “Let’s talk about that later. I have a family matter to attend to first.”

After saying that, he looked at Lan Chudie with a warm smile, “Sister Lan, you’ve worked hard on the journey. Now that we’ve found you, come over; everyone is here, and it’s very safe.”

Lan Chudie nodded gently, then tugged at Yang Kai’s clothes, but Yang Kai remained unmoved.

Jie Hongchen smiled and said loudly, “Yang Kai, if you wish, you can come over too. After all, we’re all fellow disciples! This place is fraught with danger; with your low strength, it’s only right for your senior brother to protect you!”

Nie Yong interjected angrily, “Senior Brother Jie, this person doesn’t deserve to be your junior brother at all. Have you forgotten what he did in the sect last time? He showed no respect to his seniors; why should you care for him?”

Jie Hongchen’s expression turned cold. How could he forget what happened last time? In front of so many enforcing disciples, Su Yan’s delicate hand had been held by this person. Every time he thought of it, Jie Hongchen felt a pain like a knife in his heart.

Jie Hongchen took a long breath, still smiling, but the smile was quite forced, attempting to appear indifferent. “So what? The junior brother is young and ignorant; the senior brother should be tolerant! Haven’t you all made mistakes before?”

As he spoke, Jie Hongchen’s face twitched slightly, and his gaze toward Yang Kai grew colder.

However, his words moved many Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, who immediately felt indignant. Compared to Yang Kai’s despicable and shameless behavior of poaching, Jie Hongchen appeared much more magnanimous and noble.
