## Chapter 863 — Don't Be Ridiculous

From the high towers of Mogu Castle, Li Rong and Han Fei were busily arranging things, while Hua Mo, Yinya, and Xueji were organizing their clan to gather together.

Yang Kai watched on as he recovered his strength.

Standing beside him, Wu Jie wore a conflicted expression, as if he had something to say but kept stopping himself.

“If Sect Master Wu has any questions, ask freely,” Yang Kai chuckled.

Wu Jie paused to consider, then cupped his fist respectfully and said, “Then I shall be so bold… May I ask, Saint Lord, what is your relationship with these demon folk here?”

“If I said they were my subordinates, would you believe me?” Yang Kai glanced sideways at Wu Jie, a playful smile tugging at his mouth.

Wu Jie’s face turned solemn; he stared at Yang Kai for a long moment before nodding reluctantly. “I believe you!”

He had stayed here for two days; from how those Saint Realm experts addressed and treated Yang Kai, he had already pieced together some of the truth. Now that Yang Kai had personally confirmed it, how could Wu Jie not believe?

“How could the Saint Lord have such subordinates? They’re demons!”

“And what of being demons?” Yang Kai laughed lightly.

“Humans and demons have been at odds since ancient times!” Wu Jie said in astonishment, as if it were self-evident.

“If they can help me, they are useful to me—what does it matter whether they’re demons? After all, we’re all sentient beings under heaven; must everything be divided so neatly?”

Wu Jie stared blankly at Yang Kai, his mind briefly unable to turn the corner.

He was not like Yang Kai, who had come to the Tongxuan Continent later in life.

Those born and raised on the Tongxuan Continent naturally harbored prejudice and distrust toward other races; Wu Jie was no exception. He secretly believed that siding with demons would end poorly.

Yang Kai’s open, carefree stance made it all the harder for him to accept.

After thinking a while, he spoke in a low voice, “But Saint Lord, have you considered that if word of this spreads, you may never be able to stand in human territory again? It could implicate the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and your sect, Tianxiao.”

Yang Kai shook his head. “I don’t care what the world thinks. No one gets to dictate how I act. If anyone wants to give me trouble, they're welcome to come and try.”

Wu Jie moved his lips and was at a loss for words. “The Saint Lord truly is extraordinary.”

He shook his head again. “But there’s one thing I can’t comprehend: these demons are powerful, and five of them are Saint Realm experts. Demons are always arrogant—prouder than humans. With their cultivation and strength, how could they become your subordinates?”

No demon had ever become a human’s subordinate before; making demons endure such humiliation was worse than killing them.

Yet Wu Jie saw Li Rong and the others treat Yang Kai with deep reverence, willingly submitting to his command.

“Because I’m the heir of the Great Demon God,” Yang Kai grinned broadly.

Wu Jie’s expression instantly changed; he gave a strained laugh, “Saint Lord, don’t joke about that…”

Yang Kai did not bother to explain. Instead he asked, “Sect Master Wu, what are your plans going forward?”

“Plans?” Wu Jie frowned. “None for now—let’s get through the current crisis first. But rest assured, Saint Lord, everything I’ve seen these past few days will remain between us.”

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly. “I know the kind of person you are; there’s no need for promises.”

Wu Jie said no more and, together with Yang Kai, looked toward the heights of Mogu Castle.

There, Li Rong and Han Fei seemed to have finished their arrangements. Li Rong held the Saint Pill Yang Kai had only just refined in her hand, her expression reverent as she slowly closed her lovely eyes.

In the next moment, both she and Han Fei released a thick surge of Demon Yuan from within their bodies.

Ribbons of light bloomed at their feet, faintly revealing an intricate array of formations.

Amid the flashing light, the mysterious pill in Li Rong’s hand suddenly detonated, transforming into a drifting mist that descended and enveloped the gathered members of the Ancient Demon Clan.

The clan members did not delay; they circulated their techniques and absorbed the pill’s effects into their bodies, joy evident on each face.

Crackling sounds filled the air...

A series of squelching noises—flesh and bone shifting—emanated.

Yang Kai watched in astonishment as the Ancient Demon Clan seemed to undergo subtle, strange changes; the invisible shackles that had bound them were being shattered.

They regained their freedom.

The scene continued for a full hour before the dissipated mist finally vanished, its essence fully absorbed by the Ancient Demon Clan.

Li Rong and Han Fei opened their eyes and smiled down at those below.

“Lady Li, everything is in order.” Hua Mo stood below and called up loudly.

“Is everything packed?” Li Rong asked.

“Everything that needed to be taken has been taken.”

“Good!” Li Rong nodded lightly, excitement brightening her face. “Today our clan leaves this place. Remember this home with your own eyes—this is where our people have lived for thousands of years; you will not return here.”

Every member of the Ancient Demon Clan looked around with complex expressions.

From birth they had longed to leave and see the outside world, but now that the moment had come, an inexplicable sadness welled up in them.

After all, this place had given them life and nurtured them.

“Those in charge, please come up,” Li Rong beckoned.

Hua Mo, Yinya, and Xueji leaped to Li Rong’s side. The five exchanged glances and nodded, then unleashed power capable of tearing open space and rent the chaotic sky.

Their method was different from how Yang Kai had ripped space; they used a specific technique to open an exit from this Small Xuan Realm to the outside world.

The last time Yang Kai left, Li Rong and the others had used this same method to send him off.

“I’ll go out and take a look first—protect the clan and follow!” Li Rong said, and she charged into the rift.

After her figure disappeared, Han Fei and the others organized the clan to pass through the gateway in orderly fashion and depart the Small Xuan Realm.

…

On the endless snowy mountains, Xueli stared downwards with a grave expression, while Yu Mo’s face was equally unpleasant.

Not far off, Zhang Ao and Cao Guan and the others were left shaken.

Below, several peaks had been leveled— the result of a battle between a Saint Realm expert at the Second Stage and one at the Third Stage.

Poisonous and corrupting miasma had spread across a vast area, and no one dared to venture down to investigate; the once-spotless snow had become a poisoned swamp.

Those with slightly lesser strength would be struck down on the spot by the toxins and corruption, becoming nothing but a pool of pus—several Poxuan Palace disciples who went down to investigate had met that fate.

“That damned Coffin-Bearer, a fellow demon no less, actually dared attack me—he deserves to die!” Xueli’s lovely face twisted as she spat venomously.

A few days earlier, she had tracked Yang Kai’s vanishing trace here and found signs of the Coffin-Bearer in a cave. Before she could investigate further, he suddenly attacked.

Facing a living dead whose strength reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, Xueli had her hands full.

After two days of bitter struggle she had torn his flesh to pieces, yet even after his body was smashed, the centuries-old toxins and corruption within him spread, forcing Xueli to withdraw as she used techniques to disperse the poison and wait for an opening.

The blood coffin the Coffin-Bearer guarded drew her particular attention.

From that coffin she sensed a thrilling aura—the aura of the Great Demon God!

She was nearly certain that the blood coffin was connected to the legendary Great Demon God.

Zhang Ao, Cao Guan, and the others watched helplessly; they had come for the Coffin-Bearer, but Xueli had taken the prize before they could.

Against this demonic general they had no leverage; they could only watch events unfold, bitterness worse than gall burning their hearts.

The toxins and corruption covering the area began to thin; soon they would be able to go down and investigate.

At that moment, a streak of red light suddenly flared, spreading an unsettling aura that made Xueli uneasy.

Her face drained of color as she focused; within the red light a figure shimmered into being, hovering in midair. She waved a hand and blew away the remaining toxins and corruption, then glanced around with a cold, severe expression.

She had discovered scattered fragments of flesh and bone belonging to the Coffin-Bearer.

“Second Stage of the Saint Realm?” Xueli stared in surprise at the suddenly appeared beauty, confusion in her eyes.

She clearly felt an extremely dense Demon Yuan within this woman—undoubtedly a demon.

How had such a woman suddenly appeared here?

The newcomer seemed to notice Xueli as well; from a short distance away her cold eyes fixed on them, unafraid and even laced with hatred and provocation.

Xueli smiled silently—her cultivation was a touch higher, so she felt secure.

Whoosh—whoosh—whoosh—

One after another, figures flashed out from the red light; each was a demon. Once they materialized, they spread out from the woman who had appeared first, looking for places to settle.

When they stopped, they inspected their surroundings with curiosity and excitement, their faces glowing with exhilaration.

Feeling the cold, they scooped up the fallen snow and burst into exclamations of wonder.

It was as if they had never seen such things before.

Night had fallen and the chilly moonlight poured down. The crescent moon and faint stars caught their attention; one by one they looked up and pointed at the sky.

Xueli and her companions were dumbfounded, frozen in place, their brows knitted—unable to comprehend where so many demons had suddenly come from.

Freed ancient demons beheld the dazzling world and felt a rebirth of life; their bodies trembled with emotion, many shedding tears and howling to the heavens.

The scene was raucous and lively.

Xueli and her group were reduced to spectators, barely noticed.

Only when Yang Kai and Wu Jie, followed last by Han Fei, stepped from the Small Xuan Realm did Xueli’s sharp eyes abruptly turn toward them, her gaze filled with greed.
