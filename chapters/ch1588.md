## Chapter 1588 — The Thank‑You Gift Sent to the Wrong Person

Upon hearing Shan Qingluo say that, Yang Kai finally understood why yao experts from other territories were so eager to flock to Chi Yue's palace — it turned out they wanted to borrow that Great Space Array.

"By the way, Qingluo, this Blood Prison Trial won't be easy; take this, you don't have much time but try to refine it as much as you can — perhaps it can help you!" Yang Kai suddenly remembered something, pulled it from his Spatial Ring, and handed it to Shan Qingluo.

"This is…" Shan Qingluo looked at what Yang Kai offered with suspicion, her beautiful eyes brightening as she cried out, "a Void King‑Grade Secret Treasure?"

She instantly sensed the fierce yet restrained energy fluctuations emanating from it — a special kind of energy signature only a Void King‑Grade Secret Treasure could possess!

"Mm." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "It's called the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip. I think it should suit you well."

Shan Qingluo's eyes curved in a smile; she made no pretense of politeness but took the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip with open grace. She quietly guided a trace of her Saint Yuan into it and the long whip immediately hummed, as if resonating with her Saint Yuan.

"This really does seem to suit me…" Shan Qingluo wore a pensive look. "Its previous owner was human, right? The residual life imprint inside doesn't quite match the treasure itself… hm, it seems it must be driven by yao power to unleash its full might."

"Oh?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

He truly hadn't known that.

The Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip had originally been the Leitai Sect's treasured relic. After Yang Kai killed Fang Peng inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, this Void King‑Grade Secret Treasure became his spoil. He hadn't studied it closely — he'd only vaguely felt that a whip‑shaped treasure matched Shan Qingluo's queenly temperament, so he gave it to her.

Imagine it: the seductive, enchanting Shan Qingluo flicking the long whip — hair flying, sleeves billowing — stirring one's blood and awakening a fierce desire to conquer…

"It's called the Thunder‑Fire Seven‑Beasts Whip?" Shan Qingluo played with the whip delightedly, reluctant to put it down.

"Indeed!"

"Then that must be it. This was likely once owned by some yao expert and ultimately fell into human hands. I can sense its original master's aura!"

"Hearing you say that, it does fit," Yang Kai said with a slight frown. "When I fought the previous owner of this treasure I always felt the whip itself wasn't that powerful. If what you say is true, its might wasn't fully realized. But now that it's in your hands, it won't be disgraced any longer."

"I will not let it down, Yang Kai, thank you!" Shan Qingluo's eyes clouded with longing as she gazed at Yang Kai, a rosy flush rising on her lovely cheeks.

She had never owned a Void King‑Grade Secret Treasure before.

Those who possessed treasures of that caliber were lord‑level figures among the yao!

She knew better than anyone how precious such a secret treasure was.

And yet now—such an invaluable treasure, Yang Kai simply gave it away without batting an eye.

She clearly felt her weight in Yang Kai's estimation…

Her heart leapt; in that instant she felt all her years of waiting and guarding swell into a clear, sweet spring that drenched her heart, filling it with sweetness.

"Um… should I step aside?" Xia Ningshang asked meekly from the side.

Shan Qingluo paused, then giggled coquettishly. She rose slowly, walked to Xia Ningshang, extended a delicate hand to lift the girl's chin, raised her small face, then leaned forward. Her red lips descended toward Xia Ningshang.

"Sister Qingluo, what are you doing… um…"

Xia Ningshang didn't finish her sentence before Shan Qingluo silenced her with a kiss; through the veil their soft lips met. Xia Ningshang even felt something probing into her small mouth.

She blinked wide-eyed, utterly bewildered.

Yang Kai was stunned.

After a while, Shan Qingluo straightened, flicked out a crimson tongue to wet her lips, shot Yang Kai a coquettish glance, laughed like a silver bell, and swaggered away.

She left Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang both breathing heavily.

"Qingluo, wasn't this thank‑you gift given to the wrong person?" Yang Kai asked in a dry throat, his eyes fixed on the doorway; her parting flirtatious glance had nearly stolen his soul.

"Mm…" Xia Ningshang lowered her head, as if too ashamed to be seen, her delicate earlobes flushed crimson.

Yang Kai looked at her and felt his thoughts run wild. Although Shan Qingluo's gift had clearly been meant for another — and even came through a veil — somehow it stoked his blood all the more, rousing a desire from the depths of his heart.

He stood, walked over to Xia Ningshang, and lifted her in his arms around the waist.

Yang Kai felt Xia Ningshang's delicate body burning hot against him.

...

Over on Di Chen's side, six yao newcomers had originally been slated to go to Cuiwei Star to participate in the Blood Prison Trial.

Chi Yue claimed two of the spots, naturally Shan Qingluo and Yu Xiong.

Besides them, there were Mi Tian and Xue Lian from the Thousand‑Eye Domain and the Blood Jiao Domain, and two other yao experts — all uniformly Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

However, now that Ba He had returned, he naturally insisted on taking his place in this Blood Prison Trial.

Ba He chose this moment to make amends with Chi Yue and return to the palace, partly because he wanted to seize the chance to enter the Blood Prison Trial in hopes of breaking through his current bottleneck and ascending to the new Realm.

With Yang Kai added, Di Chen would be sending eight people to Cuiwei Star.

How many would return alive, no one dared guarantee; every Blood Prison Trial was fraught with peril, and at least half of the contenders usually perished.

The dangers in the Blood Prison did not come only from the Domain might that suffused the terrifying battlefield; more threats came from rival practitioners from different Cultivation Stars.

It could be said that most experts' deaths were related to fights between each other.

But no matter how deadly it was, that could not extinguish the passion and determination of Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts to enter the Blood Prison. The breakthrough to the Void King Realm was so arduous that out of one hundred Third Stage cultivators, at most two or three could cultivate their Shi to maturity and qualify to attempt the Void King breakthrough, and among those two or three, perhaps none would truly succeed.

Thus Void King Realm practitioners were extremely rare throughout the Star Domain; any warrior who reached that height could become a local power.

Entering the Blood Prison not only allowed one to comprehend Domain might left on that battlefield tens of thousands of years ago, one could even find a special thing within it.

Domain Stone!

The formation of Domain Stones had much to do with those fallen Void King Realm warriors: the Domain might they erupted with in life and death was absorbed by peculiar jades in the Blood Prison. After countless years of accumulation and sedimentation, these formed into something unique — the Domain Stone.

Domain Stones contain the secrets of Domains and allow warriors to comprehend them at any time and place.

Most Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors entered the Blood Prison Trial in order to obtain Domain Stones.

They did not expect to break through to the Void King Realm inside the Blood Prison; they only sought a few Domain Stones to bring back and meticulously ponder their subtleties in order to advance their Martial Dao.

This was the ultimate purpose for most warriors entering it and the root cause of the fighting; without such items, perhaps ninety percent of experts would retain their reason and not clash so readily.

After all, at that level of cultivation no one wished to fall.

But it was precisely the temptation of Domain Stones that made the death toll of each Blood Prison Trial terrifyingly high.

Shan Qingluo's understanding of the Blood Prison Trial was undoubtedly far deeper than Yang Kai's — she had told him all this information. When he learned that Domain Stones existed in the Blood Prison, he immediately took an interest.

Although he was currently only Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, one day he would become a Third Stage expert and charge toward that supreme Martial Dao.

Domain Stones would undoubtedly help him greatly.

He rubbed his hands together and waited eagerly for the day the Blood Prison Trial would begin.

In the meantime, Xia Ningshang continued refining pills while Yang Kai studied the half set of the Yao Transformation Technique Chi Yue had taught him, striving to develop the primordial power of the Sacred Spirit within his body as fully as possible.

Everything remained calm and peaceful.

A month and a half later, while Yang Kai was in the attic channeling the Origin Power of the Golden Sacred Dragon within his body, his expression suddenly shifted—he lifted his head and looked outside.

Moments later there was a knock at the door. Yang Kai rose, opened it, and found Shan Qingluo standing there.

"It's time?" Yang Kai asked.

"Mm." Shan Qingluo nodded lightly. "Foster mother said we should assemble now."

"Very well!" Yang Kai nodded. "Wait a moment, I'll be right there."

With that he stepped back into the attic, and a moment later reappeared in front of Shan Qingluo, letting her lead the way.

Within one of the palace halls, an exceedingly terrifying power had gathered. Not only were there outstanding young yao experts present, but several Void King Realm masters were also seated in command.

Everyone remained silent, seemingly waiting patiently for something.

From time to time yao experts arrived, bowed deeply to the three lords above, then took a seat and closed their eyes to conserve their strength.

Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo arrived last. The moment Yang Kai stepped into the hall his eyes narrowed and his Saint Yuan involuntarily circulated.

To his shock there were three Void King Realm experts seated in the hall; besides Chi Yue there were two others he had never seen.

But the sharp gazes of those two yao experts made his scalp prickle.

"Eh, Chi Yue, why is there a human here?" asked the red‑haired elder to the left, buzzing with suspicion as he stared at Yang Kai.

"Yes, Chi Yue, you've never told us about this before — what does it mean?" The bronze‑skinned burly man to the right also looked puzzled.

Chi Yue laughed softly and said lightly, "Why make a fuss, both of you? He's only a mere human."
