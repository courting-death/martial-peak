## Chapter 922 — Searching

Time flashed by, and a month later the Sacred Land disciples Xu Hui had sent out to gather information returned in droves. After listening to their reports, the Grand Elder began to suspect that something unusual had occurred across the world, and immediately hurried to Saint Lord Yang Kai's courtyard to request an audience.

Yang Kai had long been waiting for this day, so he did not go to refine pills.

Inside the main hall, Xu Hui wore a strange expression and said, "Saint Lord, those disciples we sent out traveled for a month and investigated the major events along the routes they passed through, and they discovered a very odd phenomenon."

"What?"

"Across the entire continent, many portals leading to different Small Xuan Realms have suddenly appeared!"

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and his face turned grave.

Ever since the Sacred Tomb's entrance opened, the starry sky gate activated, and an entrance to a Small Xuan Realm appeared two thousand li away, Yang Kai had harbored a nagging, unpleasant suspicion — which was why he had Xu Hui dispatch disciples to investigate.

The results of their investigation matched his suspicions closely, and a sense of unease crept into him.

Xu Hui continued, "From the disciples' inquiries, it seems those portals to the Small Xuan Realms all opened at roughly the same time, and they opened on their own. In this period, cultivators across the continent have been swept by a treasure-seeking craze for entering Small Xuan Realms. Countless people have rushed in and out of different Small Xuan Realms, yet the disciples report that most of those Small Xuan Realms are empty and devoid of life; only the occasional one contains some ancient ruins or treasures."

"Were you able to determine when those portals opened?"

Xu Hui nodded. "It appears to have been about a month and a half ago."

A month and a half... the timing only deepened Yang Kai's misgivings; it coincided with when he rescued Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang.

Could the strange space where the Great Demon God's soul incarnation resided actually be connected to these Small Xuan Realm portals?

The Great Demon God had said that place was the continent's nexus; if it were destroyed, unimaginable things would happen.

Could what the Great Demon God warned about be referring to the present situation?

Because that place was the continent's nexus, if it were destroyed then the hidden Small Xuan Realms across the land could reappear among the world. But that didn't necessarily sound wholly bad—so why had the Great Demon God's soul incarnation appeared so solemn?

Moreover, his tone when he spoke had been as if some great calamity were about to descend, which made Yang Kai pay it serious heed.

Seeing Yang Kai's expression wavering, Xu Hui did not dare say more and stood silently to await orders.

After a long pause, the Grand Elder tentatively asked, "Saint Lord, should our Sacred Land also send people to search and explore the Small Xuan Realms? There might be unexpected gains. The disciples have roughly completed their cultivation during this time; it's about time they got out and moved around."

Yang Kai looked up at him, pondered for a moment, then nodded. "Very well. Sacred Land disciples may go out freely to seek and explore the Small Xuan Realms, but have them keep an eye out for intelligence for me."

"Saint Lord, understood!"

"If any of the Small Xuan Realms contain places like Zhongdu, Cangyun Evil Land, or Tianlang Kingdom, report immediately without delay!"

"Yes!" Xu Hui did not press to know exactly what those place names meant; from Yang Kai's expression it was plain they were important to him.

"Also, fetch Wu Jie and tell him I need his help," Yang Kai added.

The Grand Elder then respectfully withdrew.

Sitting upright in the hall's chair, Yang Kai's thoughts churned.

This incident, though unexpected, might be an opportunity—the chance to return to Zhongdu.

He had always worried about his relatives over in Zhongdu but had never been able to find a way back. In earlier days he had been rootless and weak, but now that he had finally secured stability and wielded great power, he naturally wished to bring his family and friends over here to enjoy superior cultivation conditions.

Now that all the hidden Small Xuan Realm entrances on the continent had opened on their own, some of those portals must lead back to the world he came from.

Strictly speaking, Zhongdu could be counted as a Small Xuan Realm.

But unlike other Small Xuan Realms, Zhongdu's world was relatively vast.

If any malicious Saint Realm experts were to go into Zhongdu, even the combined might of the Eight Great Families might be helpless to stop them.

He had to find a way home as soon as possible and return to Zhongdu ahead of others.

An hour later, Wu Jie hurried over.

Yang Kai asked him to use the Netherworld Sect's current strength to keep watch for news from Zhongdu. Wu Jie eagerly agreed and hurried back to make arrangements.

Since cultivating ties with Yang Kai, Wu Jie's Netherworld Sect had prospered; he would not refuse any request of Yang Kai's.

After finishing these matters, Yang Kai gave Xia Ningshang a few instructions, then, alone, summoned the Flying Shuttle. Turning into a streak of azure light, he vanished into the Nine Peaks.

A day later he arrived at Tianxiao Sect.

On Qixiu Peak he found Senior Aunt Fei Yu and likewise asked her to use Tianxiao Sect's resources to help watch for information.

After a brief delay, Yang Kai left again.

Two days later, he reached Dragon-Phoenix Palace.

In the Dragon Pavilion, Dragon Emperor Sun Yu sat cross-legged, cultivating from the Dragon-Phoenix Palace's most precious martial art manual.

Ever since Sun Yu had successfully entered the Dragon Valley forbidden area a few years ago and unlocked the Dragon Emperor's inheritance, he had become the most prominent figure in the Dragon-Phoenix Palace.

Palace Master Chen Zhou and the elders regarded him as the sect's greatest hope for revival and provided him with top-tier training conditions and ample resources.

It had been a year and a half since he safely left the Dragon Valley, and Sun Yu's cultivation had progressed somewhat during that time, though not to his satisfaction.

When Sun Yu had entered Dragon Valley those years ago, he spent two years soaring from True Yuan Realm Seventh Stage to Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage, leaping across an entire great realm.

But now, after a year and a half, he had only reached the peak of Divine Roaming Realm; the slow pace of his advancement left much to be desired.

Still, because of his Dragon Emperor title, the Palace Master and elders refrained from scolding him and patiently awaited the moment he would surge skyward.

Only Sun Yu himself knew the true Dragon Emperor was someone else.

His rapid growth in the Dragon Valley had been due to instruction from that predecessor. After that predecessor departed, even Sun Yu's diligent cultivation could only keep his progress somewhat faster than ordinary people.

Such a pace inevitably disappointed the Palace Master and his mentors.

To make matters worse, Palace Master had been busy trying to find a Phoenix Empress match for him, which exasperated Sun Yu; he could only brood and retreat into seclusion.

The search for a Phoenix Empress was put on hold.

While meditating, Sun Yu suddenly felt a danger omen, as if a pair of eyes were observing him, and the room's atmosphere shifted.

He snapped his eyes open and barked, "Who?"

A man stood before him with a kindly, approving smile and said, "Good vigilance — you seem to have grown quite a bit."

Hearing the voice and seeing the man's build and face, Sun Yu was overjoyed. He sprang up and called, "Senior Yang?"

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

"When did you arrive? How long have you been here?" Sun Yu asked eagerly as he bounded up to Yang Kai.

"Just arrived," Yang Kai replied casually. "Lower your voice — there are two Transcendent Realm guards outside."

"Oh." Sun Yu glanced outside, shrank his neck, and lowered his voice. He obligingly dragged over a chair and said, "Senior Yang, please sit."

When Yang Kai sat, Sun Yu respectfully poured him a cup of water and stood to one side, smiling as if he were greeting his dearest kin.

Yang Kai probed Sun Yu with his divine sense, nodded lightly, and said, "Your progress looks good. You've trained hard lately, haven't you?"

Sun Yu's face soured. "Don't tease me, Senior Yang. Compared to ordinary people this progress may be fine, but against the expectations Palace Master and my teachers have for me it's far too little, and I'm not satisfied myself."

"No rush; strength grows steadily over time."

"Senior Yang, when will you reveal everything to Palace Master? The pressure on me has been immense lately," Sun Yu said painfully.

"I know," Yang Kai said, nodding. "But now is not the time."

From being an ordinary disciple to becoming the sect's hope, Sun Yu might have initially reveled in the attention, but once he understood the burden on his shoulders he would learn what it meant to be ill-prepared for one's responsibilities.

Pressure is natural.

"Wait a while longer," Yang Kai comforted. He planned to first locate Su Yan and have her inherit the Phoenix Nest's Empress legacy, then disclose everything to the Dragon-Phoenix Palace. When the Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress appeared together, they would likely welcome it happily.

"Is there anything you need while you're here?"

"There is one matter I need your help with." Yang Kai's expression turned serious as he repeated his requests for Wu Jie and Senior Aunt Fei Yu to assist in gathering intelligence.

Naturally, Sun Yu did not refuse.

Half a day later, under Palace Master Chen Zhou's orders, many elites of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace set out in all directions.

After bidding Sun Yu farewell, Yang Kai stood on his Flying Shuttle with his divine sense released, monitoring the surrounding movements.

He used every connection at his disposal to try to locate news of Zhongdu as quickly as possible.

He had planned to visit the Water Divine Hall, but reconsidered—Shui Ling knew his origins. If they discovered an entrance to Zhongdu, Shui Ling would send people to notify the Nine Heavens Sacred Land without needing Yang Kai to speak.

While rushing through the skies, Yang Kai kept his divine sense extended. Whenever he detected fluctuations of void forces nearby, he immediately investigated to see if a Small Xuan Realm portal had appeared; if so, he'd enter to check whether that Small Xuan Realm was his homeland.

One disappointment after another, one failed attempt after another, tormented him with mounting anxiety.

The Zhongdu Eight Great Families were preeminent there, yet compared with Tongxuan Continent they were insignificant; if some force discovered and coveted that place, a great conflict might erupt.
