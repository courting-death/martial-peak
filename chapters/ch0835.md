## Chapter 835 — Breakthrough: Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm

At the bottom of Dragon Valley, Yang Kai stood motionless as if immersed in an ocean of Heaven-and-Earth Energy, merging himself into it; the sensation was subtle and unlike anything he had experienced before.

Power within his body climbed relentlessly, soon reaching a pinnacle, yet it showed no sign of stopping and surged crazily onward, breaking through former limits.

Yang Kai knew clearly that he was about to breakthrough.

Several years had passed since his last advancement. While waiting for the golden dragon to devour the energy, Yang Kai had not neglected his cultivation, and he had gained many insights during his pill refinement.

One could say this breakthrough was the inevitable result of circumstance—there had been no obstruction at all.

The world’s majestic power suffused him, tempering his already exceptionally sturdy body and refining the True Yuan within. Flesh and blood writhed and flowed; every inch of his body swelled with unimaginable strength.

Yang Kai felt deliriously joyful.

He flung his heart and mind wide open, accepting the baptism of Heaven-and-Earth’s might with complete abandon.

Most martial artists, when breaking through, would deploy True Yuan or secret treasures to protect themselves, lest the world’s power wound them during the process.

Though extremely safe, that practice yields fewer benefits.

Yang Kai had no need for such measures—this was the advantage of a formidable body: the stronger and harder it was, the greater the gains, creating a virtuous cycle. Hence every martial artist prized a solid foundation; the firmer the base, the clearer the benefits later on.

Yang Kai’s foundation was as solid as iron-clad walls.

He casually glanced at Sun Yu, who was being shielded by the Vast Heaven Shield and the silver-leaf secret treasure, and saw he would not be affected—so Yang Kai relaxed.

One terrifying divine force after another struck like lightning from the sky; the earth shook and mountains quivered, apocalyptic scenes unfolded, and the faces of those guarding the valley’s mouth from Dragon-Phoenix Palace went pale and muscles twitched.

Having witnessed such annihilating power, no one could guarantee Sun Yu’s safe return.

Chen Zhou and Ling Jian were frantic like ants on a hot pan, itching to descend to the valley floor but afraid that a rash movement would disturb Sun Yu; they fretted and wore anxious expressions.

Just at that moment, Xiao Ling—who had gone out to make arrangements—returned with a report: the nearby Youhan Grotto-Heaven had indeed been alarmed. Their experts had already turned out in full force, and under the leadership of two First Stage Saint Realm experts, they were rushing toward Dragon Valley.

Chen Zhou’s face hardened; a cold, cutting light flashed in his eyes like the edge of a blade.

Since Dragon-Phoenix Palace’s decline, Youhan Grotto-Heaven had risen in prominence. The two factions frequently clashed, though both retained Saint Realm experts, so small disputes were common but large-scale slaughter rarely erupted.

Everyone knew that once a battle escalated too far, no side would benefit.

Though Dragon-Phoenix Palace had only Chen Zhou at the Saint Realm, if a true fight broke out, Youhan Grotto-Heaven could not afford heavy losses either.

This time they came on the offensive with force—the reason was plain to Chen Zhou.

"Elder Ling, watch over things here. If Sun Yu can return safely... take him far from the Palace and tell him our revival depends on him."

"Palace Lord!" Ling Jian’s face changed; he vaguely realized what Chen Zhou intended.

"Xiao Ling, Tingyi, come with me to meet them! I want to see what ability they have to dare attack Dragon-Phoenix Palace!" Chen Zhou barked, his figure wavering as he flew away.

Xiao Ling and Yu Tingyi hurried after him.

Soon only Ling Jian remained at the valley mouth.

Staring at the valley floor, Ling Jian fretted like an ant on a hot pan, stamping his foot: "That brat still won’t come out—he’s driving me crazy."

Deep in the valley, beam after beam of Heaven-and-Earth power struck; Yang Kai refused none and accepted them all, excitement rippling across his face.

This continued for about an hour before the gathered power thinned and the terrifying energy blanketing Dragon Valley gradually dissipated.

An invisible wave of energy centered on Yang Kai thundered outward in all directions.

In that instant, Yang Kai felt light as air; an indescribably pleasant sensation spread through every inch of his skin and flesh. When he clenched his fist, power surged covertly.

His Divine Sense spread farther than before and his observation grew more precise.

Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

He was but a Stage away from the Saint Realm.

Dozens of li away, someone was fighting a death struggle; waves of Saint Realm expert aura washed over him, making Yang Kai frown, unsure what had occurred.

He paid little mind to outsiders and looked himself over.

The golden dragon pattern that should have been on his back now seemed alive, trailing across his skin from back to chest in an uncanny display.

Within that dragon pattern roiled vast, unimaginable power that made even Yang Kai’s heart tremble.

It brimmed with endless majesty and carried a peculiar aura.

Yao qi!

Having encountered many yao experts and once conversed with a Great Yao Lord, Yang Kai was intimately familiar with yao qi; this dragon’s energy bore traces of yao essence.

Understanding dawned in his mind, and Yang Kai instantly saw through everything.

This inheritance was the true Dragon Emperor legacy!

The inheritance he and Su Yan had received in the Inheritance Celestial Cave was only an opening—only by returning here to claim the hidden secrets could one become the Dragon Emperor or the Phoenix Empress.

Yang Kai didn’t know why he could perceive this, but it was likely related to having obtained the true inheritance.

After a long inspection, Yang Kai was thoroughly satisfied.

He took out a set of clothes from Black Book Space, dressed, and then released the protections binding Sun Yu.

The Vast Heaven Shield shattered, and Yang Kai pocketed the silver-leaf secret treasure.

Sun Yu still looked a bit shaken; upon seeing Yang Kai he hurriedly cupped his fists: "Thank you for saving me, Senior!"

He understood clearly that without Yang Kai’s protection he would have perished; such terrifying power might have overwhelmed him even after decades of cultivation.

"Small matter." Yang Kai smiled faintly, glancing toward the valley mouth and casually remarked, "There’s a First Stage Transcendent Realm warrior over there who seems to be waiting for you."

"First Stage Transcendent?" Sun Yu was startled, then excited: "That must be my master! Damn, we’ve been trapped here so many days—master must be frantic. Senior, do you know how long we’ve been here?"

"About two years," Yang Kai answered offhand.

"Two years?" Sun Yu gasped; those two years had flown by. He hadn’t noticed time passing—following Yang Kai had brought him huge gains, and that joy and excitement had blurred his sense of time.

"Don’t rush off yet." Yang Kai chuckled and looked at him: "Remember the agreement between us?"

Sun Yu turned serious and nodded: "I remember. You treated me like a teacher—I'll never reveal your existence."

"Good."

"But... if the Palace Lord and my master ask about the Dragon Emperor inheritance, what should I say?"

Yang Kai frowned; he had no good excuse. Although he had been cultivating Sun Yu and drastically improved his aptitude—so in time Sun Yu would achieve much—the Dragon Emperor inheritance could not be faked. He shook his head: "Never mind that. It looks like your Dragon-Phoenix Palace experts are locked in fierce combat and appear to be on the losing side."

"Fierce combat?" Sun Yu frowned and sent out his Divine Sense but sensed nothing.

His cultivation wasn’t high enough to detect unrest some dozens of li away, but after a moment’s thought he realized: "It must be Youhan Grotto-Heaven. Damn—those guys must have detected activity here and launched a major assault on our Palace."

"Are your two factions at odds?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Sun Yu shook his head: "They pick fights for no reason. They cultivate ice-cold techniques and martial skills, and there’s something at Dragon-Phoenix Palace they covet."

Yang Kai frowned and hit upon the key: "The inheritance in the Phoenix Nest?"

"Exactly." Sun Yu nodded. "The Dragon Emperor inheritance has surfaced; the Dragon Emperor must choose a favored woman to inherit the Phoenix Nest’s legacy—that’s Youhan Grotto-Heaven’s objective. If they succeed, they might annex Dragon-Phoenix Palace."

Yang Kai gave a soft, low chuckle.

"Senior, why are you laughing?" Sun Yu asked.

"You’re in serious trouble!" Yang Kai grinned with glee.

Sun Yu thought for a moment and his face paled as understanding dawned. Everyone at Dragon-Phoenix Palace would assume he’d triggered the seal and obtained the Dragon Emperor inheritance. No matter how tightly the news was sealed, it couldn’t escape Youhan Grotto-Heaven’s probe; in short, this attack was aimed squarely at him.

They intended to seize him and force him to pick a woman from Youhan Grotto-Heaven to become the Phoenix Empress’s successor so she could receive the Phoenix Nest inheritance.

"Senior..." Sun Yu looked flustered and glanced at Yang Kai, hoping he would act to rescue him.

"Rest assured. Since I caused this, I’ll handle it. Besides, it’s a good chance to let Dragon-Phoenix Palace confirm you truly obtained the Dragon Emperor inheritance."

Sun Yu rejoiced: "Thank you, Senior."

"No problem." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Go—I'll protect you from harm; be bolder."

"Yes!" With Yang Kai’s promise, Sun Yu surged off toward the valley mouth in a frenzy of excitement, certain this formidable Senior could easily fend off Youhan Grotto-Heaven.

After he departed, Yang Kai turned his gaze toward the site of the battle, displeasure creasing his face.

The inheritance within the Phoenix Nest belonged to Su Yan; Youhan Grotto-Heaven daring to set their sights on it was like poking a hornet’s nest.

Were it not for this, Yang Kai would not meddle in another faction’s disputes.

But Dragon-Phoenix Palace had some ties to him, so he’d lend a hand for free—consider it repaying the favor of having received the Dragon Emperor inheritance.
