## Chapter 173 — Yunxia Sect

The waves crashed rhythmically, and the great ship sliced through the sea, steadily sailing towards the horizon.

The cries and curses of the thirty or so captured individuals gradually subsided, for even if they shouted until their throats were raw, the warriors of Yunxia Island paid them no mind, and instead, they might face a beating.

Those warriors were precise in their strikes, causing the captives to wail in pain, yet they did not inflict any lasting injuries.

Yang Kai sat in a corner of the deck, coldly observing everything. His freedom was unrestrained; he neither shouted nor attracted anyone's attention.

The ship had been sailing for about an hour, and they were nearly a hundred miles away from the coastal city.

Yang Kai had been quietly watching the movements of a True Essence Realm expert on board, contemplating the chances of survival if he were to jump ship and escape.

With his Qi Movement Realm strength, he was not worried about drowning; his stamina was sufficient. What he feared was that the True Essence Realm expert would leap off the ship to pursue him.

Just as he wore a troubled and hesitant expression, an old fisherman, also captured, took advantage of the moment and leaped off the great ship before Yang Kai.

A soft splash echoed, and the thirty or so captives grew excited, rushing towards the ship's edge, eager to follow the old fisherman’s lead and jump into the sea to escape.

Yet, the Yunxia Island warriors did not stop them; they merely looked on with cold smiles.

Yang Kai felt something was amiss. They had gone to great lengths to capture these ordinary people; it made no sense for them to let them go so easily.

Suddenly, a chilling scream pierced the air from below, sending shivers down the spine. It was the old fisherman who had just jumped. Hearing this sound, those who had rushed to the ship's edge froze in their tracks, their eyes wide as they stared at the sea.

“What happened? What’s going on?”

“There’s a monster below!”

“There are man-eating monsters under the ship!”

The ordinary people shouted in terror, rooted in place, losing the courage to jump.

One of the Yunxia Sect warriors sneered, looking at the crowd, “Want to know what’s below?”

Before the ordinary people could respond, he reached for a torch from the side and hurled it into the sea.

In the brief illumination, many witnessed a horrifying scene: a pool of blood spread across the surface, and the old fisherman was now in pieces. Below the water, some grotesque fish-like beasts swam, gnashing their teeth as they tore at the fisherman’s remains.

“This is the fate of those who jump ship!” the Yunxia Sect warrior chuckled coldly.

Many people immediately retched. They were ordinary folk who had never witnessed such a bloody and gruesome sight.

Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart. He realized he could no longer entertain the idea of jumping ship to escape; the beasts following the ship were surely the monsters of the sea, likely raised by Yunxia Island itself.

In the water, these monsters were the true rulers. As a Qi Movement Realm warrior, he stood no chance of escaping before them.

“Listen up!” the Yunxia Sect warrior bellowed, his eyes flashing like lightning as he scanned the crowd. “If you don’t want to die, stay obediently on the ship. In another hour or two, we will arrive at Yunxia Island. Don’t think that capturing you is a punishment; this is an opportunity provided by my Yunxia Sect! Once we reach the island, there will be endless delicacies for you to enjoy, and fine silks to wear. As long as you pass the tests of my Yunxia Sect, you can become our disciples and, from now on, be warriors who can pluck the moon and seize the stars.”

The crowd fell silent, clearly skeptical of his words.

The Yunxia Sect warrior did not waste time on idle chatter; he merely intimidated them and then fell silent.

However, after what had just transpired, the captured ordinary people dared not speak out again, nor did they entertain thoughts of escape. With monsters lurking beneath the ship, how could they muster the courage?

The great ship continued its voyage.

After another hour or so, Yang Kai heard someone say, “We’re home.”

“Ah, I’m exhausted. We have to come out once a month; how can these people be so short-lived?”

“They're ordinary folks. No matter how well they are taken care of, they can’t last long. Shh, don’t say too much; if they hear you, they’ll panic.”

Yang Kai opened his eyes and looked ahead, where the outline of an island came into view. This island was not small; he estimated it to be four or five times the size of the coastal city. However, the island gave him a strange feeling. With his extraordinary eyesight, he noticed that the left and right halves of the island appeared somewhat different. The right side seemed shrouded in a layer of hazy mist, obscuring its true nature and any hidden secrets.

The ship was headed towards the left peninsula.

After a long while, the ship’s speed gradually slowed, eventually docking.

Disciples of Yunxia Island lowered a rope ladder from the deck, calling to the trembling ordinary people, “Everyone, disembark!”

Although the thirty or so individuals were terrified, they orderly jumped down from the great ship. The moment they set foot on solid ground, many felt their legs weaken and collapsed to the ground, truly frightened of the man-eating monsters lurking beneath the ship.

Many among them were fishermen, but after so many years of fishing, they had never encountered such monsters.

“You two, settle these people down,” the only True Essence Realm expert on the ship instructed two disciples.

“Yes, Master Uncle!” the two replied respectfully; they were the same two who had captured Yang Kai earlier.

“Let’s go; we’ll take you to enjoy some fine food,” the two Yunxia Island warriors did not make things difficult for the ordinary people, herding them forward like sheep.

Yang Kai deliberately lagged behind, wearing a smile as he asked, “When will we join the sect, Senior Brothers?”

One of them sneered coldly at Yang Kai, “Who’s your Senior Brother?”

The other, though impatient, still explained, “Don’t rush. Didn’t you hear on the ship? As long as you pass the tests of my Yunxia Sect, you can all become disciples and join the sect to cultivate martial arts.”

“What is this test?” Yang Kai continued to inquire.

“The test? Heh, it’s a very simple one; you just need to gather some things. Don’t ask too much; you’ll know when the time comes.” The man saw that Yang Kai was easy to fool, patting his shoulder as he spoke, “As long as you’re clever enough, we’ll have the chance to become brothers. You’ve just arrived at Yunxia Island; you don’t need to worry about anything. Every day, there will be delicious food served to you. When it’s time for the test, someone will naturally inform you.”

“Oh.” Yang Kai could not extract much information and had to give up.

However, Yunxia Island was indeed a good place for cultivation. The energy of heaven and earth here was rich, far superior to that at Lingxiao Pavilion. No wonder coastal sects preferred to establish themselves on islands, occupying them for cultivation, as it was inherently advantageous.

Moreover, many islands bore unique treasures and rare materials that could not be found in the mainland.

Perhaps influenced by the picturesque scenery of Yunxia Island, the captured ordinary people gradually calmed down, pointing and discussing the surrounding landscape as they walked.

One of the Yunxia Island disciples reminded, “Don’t wander around the island; there are also man-eating monsters here. If you run about recklessly, you’ll end up as nothing but bones.”

While mentioning demon beasts to ordinary people might not have much of an impact, speaking of man-eating monsters was certainly enough to instill fear.

Indeed, upon hearing this, many fell silent, recalling the fate of the old fisherman who had jumped ship.

Following the path on the island, they walked for a full hour before finally reaching their destination.

Ahead, other disciples of Yunxia Sect came to greet them, ushering the thirty or so ordinary people into a massive courtyard, chuckling lightly, “You two brothers have worked hard; tonight’s harvest is quite good.”

“Not bad. We found more people than in the previous months; these will be handed over to the junior brothers to manage.”

“Rest assured, Senior Brother.”

After exchanging a few words, the two Yunxia Sect warriors departed.

Once they left, the Yunxia Sect warrior responsible for receiving them waved his hand, “Follow me!”

Entering the courtyard, Yang Kai looked around and discovered that the surroundings were enclosed by walls, covering several miles. Within were small houses that appeared to be meant for single occupancy.

The thirty or so ordinary people were arranged into these small houses, and Yang Kai had one to himself.

The room’s furnishings were not overly luxurious, but they were decent enough, with a bed and neatly folded bedding.

“From now on, you will live here. You don’t need to worry about anything or do anything. Meals will be delivered to you daily. Your only task now is to eat well, sleep well, and wait for the tests that my Yunxia Sect will bestow upon you!” the Yunxia Sect warrior instructed.

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but think of the phrase “raising pigs.”

He did not believe that Yunxia Sect had brought ordinary people here to provide them with a good life. Raising pigs was the same; they were fed well, fattened up, and then slaughtered during festivals!

What exactly did Yunxia Sect intend to do? Yang Kai felt somewhat confused.

However, he had no way to escape now; after all, this was someone else's sect, and it was a solitary island. Unless he could secure a ship capable of withstanding the attacks of demon beasts, he had no means of leaving!

Since he was here, he would make the best of it! Yang Kai set aside his burdens and sat cross-legged on the bed to cultivate.

The next day, someone indeed brought delicious dishes. The food was exquisite and plentiful, clearly prepared with care, and there was a faint medicinal aroma, suggesting they were medicinal meals.

Yang Kai did not eat immediately; instead, he waited a long time, observing that others had finished without incident before picking up his chopsticks.

After finishing the meal, the ordinary people felt refreshed, and Yang Kai felt the same. Although the medicinal ingredients added to the food were not abundant, they were all beneficial for strengthening the body. With long-term use, even ordinary people could live to a ripe old age.

For several days, it continued like this. The captured individuals had completely ceased their complaints, fully believing the Yunxia Sect disciples that they had come here to enjoy a good life.

These were all impoverished individuals; when had they ever received such treatment? Every meal was a feast, and they were all so delighted that they forgot their troubles.

However, in addition to these medicinal meals, the captured individuals were also required to drink a kind of herbal juice daily. This juice was quite bitter, but it was beneficial for the body and had no harmful effects. Day after day, the once impoverished individuals surprisingly grew much stronger.

With their spirits lifted and their meals worry-free, they felt as if they had found paradise.

Moreover, their movements were not heavily restricted; aside from not being allowed to leave the large courtyard, they could go wherever they pleased.
