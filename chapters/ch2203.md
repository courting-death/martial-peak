## Chapter 2203 — A Good Seedling

"Wait a moment!" Yang Kai suddenly called out.

"What is it?" Chen Qian frowned slightly at his words, looking at Yang Kai with suspicion, not knowing what he wanted to do.

The others also turned their attention to him.

Yang Kai's expression was calm as he turned to face the direction where Wen Zishan was seated and cupped his fists, saying, "I can hand over the Star Seals as agreed. Just let me keep one—that's all I ask. But before that, I have a request for Hall Master Wen."

"Oh?" Wen Zishan smiled at his words and nodded, "Go ahead, what do you need this Hall Master to answer?"

Yang Kai said, "Elder Gao previously mentioned that any extra Star Seals must be handed over to the Shrine. This quota for entering the Four Seasons Land was also provided by the Shrine, so it's only right for these six extra Star Seals to be given to the Shrine." He paused, then continued, "Elder Gao also said that after handing over the Star Seals, the Shrine would give a corresponding reward..."

"So that's what it is!" Wen Zishan laughed, "You can rest assured. Although you are not a disciple of our Shrine, we will not take advantage of you. Whatever reward you deserve, you will receive..."

"Then may I make a request of my own?" Yang Kai asked.

"What request do you have? Let's hear it," Wen Zishan looked at him with great interest.

"Hall Master Wen should still remember the original reason this Junior entered the Four Seasons Land, right?" Yang Kai replied with a question of his own.

Wen Zishan thought for a moment and said, "For the Calamity Fruit? Right, I haven't asked you yet, did you obtain it on this trip?"

Yang Kai shook his head, "No. But I did find a Calamity Fruit tree in the Winter Domain. There were spirit fruits on it, but unfortunately, someone else got there first and picked them..."

"That is indeed a pity," Wen Zishan also showed a look of regret.

"The request I want to make is to ask the Shrine to help me find that spirit fruit! If Hall Master Wen can agree, I will hand over all six Star Seals!" Yang Kai said in a deep voice.

As soon as these words were spoken, all the Emperor Realm experts in the hall couldn't help but frown.

It wasn't that Yang Kai's request was unreasonable; it's just that this matter... was truly difficult to handle.

So many sects and families entered the Four Seasons Land, almost covering the entire Southern Territory. Who exactly picked the Calamity Fruit in the Winter Domain, no one saw. If Qingyang Shrine was to investigate, it would require a huge amount of manpower and effort to find out.

But even if they do find out, they may not be able to obtain it. The other party will surely ask for something in exchange. In other words, Qingyang Shrine will have to pay a certain price to have any hope of getting the Calamity Fruit.

If it was a disciple from a small sect or family who obtained the Calamity Fruit, it would be fine. Qingyang Shrine would only need to apply a little pressure, and the other party would have no choice but to comply.

The real worry is if it was a disciple from Wuhua Hall, Tianwu Sacred Land, or even Star God Palace who got it. Then it wouldn't just be a matter of a single spirit fruit, but a matter between two great sects. If not handled properly, it could result in a huge favor being owed.

All sorts of interpersonal relationships and sect interests are involved. Yang Kai might not realize it, but the higher-ups of Qingyang Shrine certainly do.

So after Yang Kai made this request, everyone fell silent.

Seeing this, Yang Kai did not urge them, simply waiting quietly in place.

After a long while, Wen Zishan finally spoke, "If I remember correctly, that Calamity Fruit isn't something you need for yourself, but something you were entrusted to obtain, right?"

"That's right!" Yang Kai nodded.

"Since you couldn't get it in the Four Seasons Land, you've already done your best. Why keep insisting? You could ask for something that benefits yourself, for example..." At this point, Wen Zishan suddenly revealed a strange, dangerous smile, his tone full of strong temptation, his voice low, "Let this Hall Master help you with a baptism, raising your cultivation by a great margin."

Yang Kai frowned, "I was entrusted by someone, so I must fulfill their request. Hall Master, why test me?"

"Heh heh..." Wen Zishan, exposed, was not embarrassed. He just smiled and said heartily, "Very well, this Hall Master agrees. The Shrine will help you find the Calamity Fruit."

"It must be found within three months!" Yang Kai said in a deep voice, "If it takes too long, I'm afraid... they won't be able to hold on."

"Three months is enough!" Wen Zishan smiled slightly, then turned to Qiu Ran, "Deputy Hall Master, you will be responsible for this. Be sure to bring the Calamity Fruit to this boy Yang within three months."

Qiu Ran stood up, cupped his fists, and said, "I obey. I will not fail the Hall Master's trust!"

With that, he actually left the hall directly, apparently preparing to send people out to search right away.

Seeing this, Yang Kai couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.

With a powerful sect like Qingyang Shrine helping to search for the spirit fruit, the chances of success were much higher. If even Qingyang Shrine couldn't find it, Yang Kai would really have no way out and could only return to Fenglin City to explain things to Qin Chaoyang.

"Is this good enough now?" Wen Zishan smiled at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod, then turned to Chen Qian and said, "I'll trouble Elder Chen with this."

Chen Qian said nothing, but swept her Divine Sense over Yang Kai, holding the incense burner in one hand and forming seals with the other, pointing at Yang Kai several times in succession.

In the next moment, Yang Kai felt a surge of heat inside his body, his arm burning hot, as if something shot out. At the same time, an indescribable discomfort welled up in his heart.

He couldn't help but let out a muffled groan, his body swaying slightly.

"Oh..." Wen Zishan was surprised to see this, his eyes showing a look of amazement.

Because everyone before Yang Kai, when their Star Seals were forcibly removed, reacted with varying degrees of discomfort. Murong Xiaoxiao, Xiao Baiyi, and Shen Muji even took several steps back. Xia Sheng, though he didn't retreat, turned pale.

Yang Kai was the same as Xia Sheng, but he had six Star Seals removed! And with only First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, he still stood straight in place.

That alone was enough to surprise people.

The others clearly noticed this as well, showing interest in him.

Swish, swish, swish...

Six beams of light shot into the sky, but were immediately restrained by Chen Qian and drawn into the incense burner.

Once everything was done, Chen Qian softly said to Yang Kai, "I left you a Five-Pointed Star Seal. If you really enter the Shattered Star Sea, make good use of it."

"Thank you, Elder Chen!" Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming his surging Qi and blood.

Of the seven Star Seals he obtained, the highest grade was only a Five-Pointed Star Seal, and even that had been traded from Wuchang. As for the Six-Pointed, Seven-Pointed, or even Eight-Pointed Star Seals that Lan Xun had mentioned before, Yang Kai had never even seen them, nor did he know if such high-grade Star Seals truly existed in this world.

Overall, Yang Kai was quite satisfied with this final result. Chen Qian had truly considered things for him and didn't just leave him any seal, but the highest grade one.

Yang Kai still didn't know what difference the grades of Star Seals made, but now wasn't the time to ask. Since he would be staying at Qingyang Shrine for a while, he planned to find an opportunity to ask someone later.

"You all have worked hard, go and rest." Wen Zishan waved to the Dao Origin Realm cultivators, "As for the rewards from the Shrine... let us discuss it and inform you another day."

"Yes!" Xia Sheng and the others responded in unison, then bowed and left the hall.

After everyone left, Elder Di Rong of Qingyang Shrine muttered, "He's a good seedling!"

Although his words were vague, everyone present understood who he meant. Naturally, he was referring to Yang Kai.

"Looks like you all noticed as well." Wen Zishan smiled, "This boy Yang... is a bit different from the rest. I think Elder Gao and Elder Chen know this best. Back on Feiyan Peak, when he fought Xue Yi, you both saw the whole thing."

Chen Qian nodded, "That's right, Xue Yi was no match for him at all!"

"He's not just a bit different, he's one in a hundred million!" Gao Xueting said in a deep voice.

"Oh? Elder Gao, you rate him so highly? Isn't that a bit much..." Di Rong turned to look at Gao Xueting, unconvinced.

"If you knew what he did in the Four Seasons Land, you wouldn't think so." Gao Xueting replied calmly.

Wen Zishan smiled, "So you're saying he did something earth-shattering in the Four Seasons Land?"

"He refined a furnace of Supreme Mystic Pills. Does that count?" Gao Xueting turned to look at him.

At these words, everyone's expression changed.

"Supreme Mystic Pill!" Di Rong exclaimed, "That legendary spirit pill said to lead straight to the Emperor Realm after taking it?"

"Whether the legend is true or not, I don't know, but he really did refine a Supreme Mystic Pill!"

"So, does that mean the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus appeared in the Four Seasons Land this time?" Wen Zishan raised his eyebrows.

"Yes." Gao Xueting nodded, and then explained everything she knew, including why Yang Kai had so many Star Seals.

After listening, the Emperor Realm experts all fell silent.

"This boy may only be at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but not only is his strength astonishing, he's also a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist?" Di Rong's expression was full of amazement as he muttered.

"And not just any Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist!" Chen Qian said in a low voice, "He refined four pills in one furnace. To achieve this, he must at least be a Middle-Level or even Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist. A beginner Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist could never do such a thing!"

"Elder Gao said he's one in a hundred million... that's quite fair." Wen Zishan said in a deep voice, "Among the rising stars of the Dao Origin Realm, to reach his level, looking across the entire Star Realm, perhaps only the last disciple of Great Emperor Miaodan could compare."

"In Martial Dao, there may be those with better aptitude than him. In Alchemy, there may also be those with better aptitude. But to excel in both at the same time, probably none!"

"Hall Master, with such a good seedling, have you never thought of bringing him into the sect? This boy seems to be a wild talent, right?" Di Rong suggested eagerly.
