## Chapter 1737 — He Zao and He Miao

In the Meteorite Sea, Yang Kai stared in astonishment at two women not far away, looking somewhat surprised.

The two women were undoubtedly even more astonished than Yang Kai; when the pursuing cultivator of the Origin Returning Realm had inexplicably died, both of them cried out in alarm, turning to look around as if to see who had come to their aid.

There was no one else nearby. They finally returned their gaze to Yang Kai, suspicion already forming in their minds, and an expression of disbelief showing in both pairs of beautiful eyes.

"What are you still standing there for? Hurry up and come over!" Yang Kai called in a low voice, waving his hand as he spoke.

Only then did the two women react; they exchanged a glance, and one of them turned and dropped down three zhang in front of Yang Kai, repeatedly sizing him up with a puzzled expression.

Yang Kai grinned at them and raised an eyebrow. "What, after so many years you don't recognize me?"

Hearing him say that, the two women both let out a long breath, confirming that their guess had been correct; the lead woman even covered her mouth with her hand and whispered, "Yang Kai?"

The other, who looked a little younger, chirped a string of questions, "Is it really you? Was that person just now killed by you? How did you become so powerful? And why are you here?" Then, suddenly growing alert, she bit her teeth and demanded, "Could you be one of Li Minghai's people?"

She spoke as if she would not stop, and Yang Kai had no time to answer any of her questions.

The slightly older lead woman studied Yang Kai carefully and slowly shook her head. "Little Sister, don't be ridiculous. If he were one of Li Minghai's people, why would he have helped us just now?"

Yang Kai chuckled softly, glancing at the younger woman with a teasing look. “He Miao, you’re still just as reckless as ever.”

He Miao's face flushed at his words and she fidgeted. "Sorry, I'm just a little too frightened."

"It doesn't matter." Yang Kai smiled slightly, glanced at the two women and sighed, "I didn't expect that after so many years we'd meet again in a place like this."

The two women were in fact the very cultivators Yang Kai had first encountered when he initially entered the Star Domain: the sisters He Zao and He Miao.

Many years had passed since they had left the Floating Continent; after they parted ways they had never met again. So Yang Kai was rather surprised at the sudden reunion. But thinking it through, He Zao and He Miao were both members of the Sword Alliance, so it was not impossible for them to appear here.

It was just that being drawn into this affair, the sisters' luck had indeed been rather poor.

"Yes, it's really been many years," He Zao said with some feeling. "I didn't expect you'd be so powerful now. You killed that person just now, didn't you?"

"Yes."

Even though the sisters had suspected it, Yang Kai's admission still left them too stunned to speak.

When they first met, Yang Kai had only been at the First Stage of the Saint Realm; the two sisters had been a little stronger than him, one at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm and the other at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

Nearly thirty years had passed, and they had both advanced to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; their aptitudes had been good, and their cultivation had progressed rapidly.

Yet compared to Yang Kai, they still seemed somewhat lacking.

The fact that he could instantly slay a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, even by ambush, showed that Yang Kai had at the very least reached the Origin Returning Realm himself — perhaps the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

At the precise moment Yang Kai had struck, He Zao had felt an energy fluctuation no weaker than Young Alliance Master Gu Jianxin's.

The two sisters were deeply shaken.

Suddenly He Zao's expression changed and she asked, "Yang Kai, could you do me a favor?"

"What is it?"

"Save my master!"

"Your master?" Yang Kai frowned and quickly realized that He Zao must be referring to that beautiful woman Yue Xi.

When they had been stranded on the Floating Continent, their master Yue Xi had been there as well. Yang Kai had dealt with her a few times and the interactions had not been pleasant; Yue Xi had looked down on Yang Kai because he came from a remote place and his cultivation rank had been low.

Furthermore, Yang Kai had once killed one of Yue Xi's disciples, which had made Yue Xi loathe him even more.

However, for various reasons Yue Xi had later changed her opinion of Yang Kai, and in the end she had relied on his strength to successfully leave the Floating Continent; as it turned out, that disciple had been no good and his death was little to be mourned.

"Yue Xi is here too?" Yang Kai peered toward the battlefield, but could only see vast flashes of light and could not make out who was fighting.

He Zao's face was full of anxiety. "We managed to escape thanks to our master delaying the enemy, but her condition is not good. I don't know how long she can hold on. Yang Kai, can you..."

She clearly knew this request was excessive. The battlefield was in chaos and there was even an expert of the Void King Realm fighting; anyone who charged in might be ground to powder.

As a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm she had no power to help Yue Xi and could only grit her teeth and beg Yang Kai for aid.

"Eldest Brother Yang..." He Miao called softly, her face pleading. She had lost her usual quick-wittedness and seemed distraught; the thought that the master who had raised them might fall on that battlefield nearly brought He Miao to tears.

Perhaps because of their experience escaping the Floating Continent, or perhaps because Yang Kai had just slain a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the sisters had an inexplicable confidence in him, as if they believed that once he acted their master would be safe.

Yue Xi had not left a good impression on Yang Kai at first, but she cared for her two disciples without question; otherwise she would not have risked herself to delay the enemy so the sisters could escape.

Yang Kai fell into thought.

He Zao and He Miao, seeing this, dared not press and could only wait anxiously.

After a moment Yang Kai lifted his eyelids and said seriously, "To tell the truth, I was hiding here mainly to ambush Li Minghai!"

He Zao and He Miao gasped in surprise, staring at Yang Kai with incredulous light in their eyes.

A cultivator of the Origin Returning Realm daring to ambush a Void King Realm cultivator — it sounded like an ant hiding in a corner stretching out a leg to trip an elephant; it was hard to believe.

"I'm not joking — when I passed this way before he ambushed me, so I stayed behind!" Yang Kai said calmly. "So I can't conveniently step out right now."

The light in the sisters' eyes rapidly dimmed.

“Still, since He Miao went and called me 'Eldest Brother', I can’t just stand by and do nothing,” Yang Kai said with a light laugh.

He Miao looked at Yang Kai with delight; her previously pale, anxious face flushed and a shy blush crossed her features.

"Come out!" Yang Kai suddenly barked, and in the next moment a scarlet stream of light shot out from his body and then coalesced into a humanoid form.

In the blink of an eye an outrageously voluptuous and stunningly beautiful woman bizarrely appeared before He Zao and He Miao.

The beautiful woman had a head of blazing red hair like a burning flame, and her clothing was also fire-red; at such close range both He Zao and He Miao felt a heart-stopping fluctuation of power within her.

It was a destructive power!

"Master, what are your orders?" the woman asked respectfully the moment she appeared, not even glancing at He Zao and He Miao, as if they were mere air and could be ignored.

"Go with them and protect their safety!" Yang Kai pointed at the He sisters.

Only then did the woman turn her attention to the two sisters and nodded slightly.

"Yang Kai, who is she..." He Zao hesitated and asked.

"My friend. You can call her Liu Yan!" Yang Kai replied.

Even Yang Kai did not notice that as he introduced her, a subtle yet exceptionally bright gleam flickered in Liu Yan's gorgeous eyes.

"So it's Sister Liu Yan — I'll trouble you this time, Sister," He Zao said. Although she could tell Liu Yan had no physical body, the presence displayed intelligence, and she dared not neglect her in the slightest.

"At my master's command, Liu Yan will obey!" Liu Yan spoke little but her words were concise and decisive.

"Go." Yang Kai nodded faintly. Liu Yan understood, twisted her body and again became a stream of light; before He Zao could react she had plunged into He Zao's body.

He Zao cried out in surprise, but soon joy spread across her face.

She felt a terrifying power now dormant within her; though it was not under her control and brought a prickling heat, with this power she could rescue her master from that battlefield!

She looked at Yang Kai with a face full of gratitude. "Thank you!"

"Be careful!" Yang Kai smiled slightly.

He Zao and He Miao exchanged a glance and then sped off toward the position of the battlefield.

With Liu Yan's assistance, the two sisters' safety would no longer be in doubt. Since Liu Yan had devoured the Qiantian Thunderflame from the Fire Radiance Sect, she had not only evolved intelligence but her strength had leapt dramatically.

Before devouring it, she had already been able to contend with a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert without being at a disadvantage.

After devouring it, she could contend with a First Stage of the Void King Realm expert.

In that battle there was only one Void King Realm cultivator, Li Minghai; none of the others were a match for Liu Yan. It was easy to imagine how the sisters' return with Liu Yan would change that one-sided battlefield.

With his mind gathered, Yang Kai turned his attention back to the combat circle where Gu Jianxin and Li Minghai were locked in battle.

Their fight was the most intense on the entire battlefield, the energy fluctuations the largest, so they were easy to locate; Yang Kai spotted them at once.

Gu Jianxin and his two Sword Servants were still three-in-one within sword-light, three phenomena—sun, moon and star—shone together, sword radiance scattering and lashing out, while Li Minghai's long spear moved back and forth with the agility of a snake.

Up to now, the two sides had reached a stalemate of equal strength!
