## Chapter 1184 — Did you find something good?

In no time at all, Yang Kai reached the end of the passage, and at that end there was, to his surprise, a small stone hut.

With the thought of “since I’m here, I might as well make the best of it,” Yang Kai stepped into the stone house.

By now he was certain—the passage and everything here had been arranged by someone; that stone hut was clearly constructed by hands.

He entered cautiously, Saint Yuan quietly coalescing around him, ready to strike at a moment's notice, fearing he might encounter someone inside; but once inside he found the hut empty, lacking even anything of substance—nothing but a single stone pedestal.

Yang Kai frowned slightly and paced the hut several times, checking carefully for a long while, but still found nothing strange; it seemed that after breaking through that maze and passing the stone-tile passage, one could only enter this stone hut and then wait for death.

He used the World-Ending Demon Eye again, but still gained nothing.

However, Yang Kai discovered a seed the size of a broad bean sitting on that stone pedestal.

He reached out and picked it up; the seed was blood-red and exuded a strange aura—an energy like that of the rampaging weeds outside.

Who knew how many years that seed had been lying there; in any case Yang Kai could still sense its vitality—if planted, it should be able to survive.

After a moment’s thought, he casually tossed it into his Spatial Ring. He had paid the price of two drops of Golden Blood to break through the weak point of that maze formation and reach this place with great effort—he couldn’t just leave empty-handed.

That seed was some consolation.

Yang Kai searched the stone hut longer and finally confirmed there was no other exit.

Did he have to return the way he came and delve back into the maze to find another route? At the thought of the maze's self-repairing function Yang Kai's head throbbed.

Reluctant though he was, Yang Kai had to accept this cruel reality. He slumped out of the stone hut.

But the moment he stepped out, his vision blurred and the frenzied weeds and stone-tile passage vanished; before him spread a red-hued space.

In midair flowed countless strands of fire-like Spiritual Qi, like a thousand serpents, and underfoot lay barren, parched brown earth.

Heat-Flame Zone!

Yang Kai's spirit jolted; fearing he had fallen back into that illusionary array, he used the World-Ending Demon Eye a third time. He finally confirmed he had not returned to that illusion, and when he looked back there was no stone hut—behind him stood a stone wall, and his position was beneath a bare little hill, as if everything he had experienced earlier had been but a mirage.

But Yang Kai knew it was not an illusion, for that blood-red seed now sat in his Spatial Ring.

Whatever the case, he had at last escaped that cursed place, and he breathed a quiet sigh of relief.

It was only him. Trapped in that maze yet still finding its weak point and tearing it open—if it were other Saint King Realm cultivators trapped inside, once bound there they'd have no choice but to wait for death, unless they were exceptionally skilled in formation array techniques.

The news of this maze had never spread. Not because no one had entered, but because those who did had no way to convey the news outside—they died within. How could they transmit anything when the maze could even seal off space? Blocking communications was trivial.

So Yang Kai guessed that the major powers on Dark Star likely knew nothing of this maze's existence.

He hoped Wei Guchang, Xuan'er, Chang Qi, Hao An and the others were not headed the same way as him; otherwise they would be doomed.

As Yang Kai quietly rejoiced, he suddenly noticed several figures flash by a few li away, moving hastily as if rushing toward some destination.

Yang Kai paused, then remembered he had been trapped in that maze for many days; any advantage he gained with his Wind-and-Thunder Wings had likely been lost—elite fighters like Wei Guchang and Xuan'er had probably gone ahead.

He took out his Yuan Magnetic Pointer and checked; the direction those people had gone was not toward the heaven-and-earth treasure area.

There was no point rushing now. He had planned to be the first to reach the heaven-and-earth treasure area and plunder it before others arrived, but the maze had delayed him and ruined that plan.

Those people must have found something valuable; otherwise they wouldn't be moving so hastily.

Yang Kai thought for a moment and followed the direction the others had disappeared into.

Tracking people in the Flowing Flame Sandland was easy—there was little vegetation here, only bare hills and mounds. Although Divine Sense was greatly suppressed by the local rules of heaven and earth, one could still see far with the naked eye, so there was little worry about losing the trail.

The farther he went the more cultivators he saw hurrying that way, as if everyone had received some irresistible news and was converging on one place.

Yang Kai was curious—if it weren't something extremely valuable, so many cultivators wouldn't be stirred; after all, more people means conflict and risk of losing one's life.

Not far off to one side were two Second Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivators wearing the same attire; Yang Kai didn't recognize their origins, but their faces didn't look villainous. He immediately changed course and flew over to question them—if it wasn't anything good, he wouldn't bother.

The two noticed Yang Kai's movement and grew wary. One middle-aged man with a refined face frowned and sized Yang Kai up; upon seeing he was only a First Stage of the Saint King Realm, the man visibly relaxed.

A First Stage of the Saint King Realm he didn't fear, so the man's caution quickly eased.

"Friends," Yang Kai called as he arrived, smiling and cupped his hands, appearing affable.

The two did not turn him away; they nodded and continued flying forward with him. The middle-aged man asked, "What's going on?"

"Why are you all running that way? Did you find something good?" Yang Kai asked directly.

The middle-aged man laughed in surprise and replied, "We don't know the specifics either, just following the crowd. But we heard someone say they've found some Fire-Glow Crystals over there—whether it's true I can't say."

"Origin-Grade Upper-Level material, Fire-Glow Crystal?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

"Exactly. It seems you're well-versed in material grades," the middle-aged man said, surprised as he looked at Yang Kai.

"Oh, I've heard the elders talk about it before," Yang Kai said casually. Fire-Glow Crystal was indeed a fine material—not only useful for forging, it could aid fire-attribute cultivators and was used in setting certain special arrays.

Yang Flame should need such things; Yang Kai himself didn't care much, but since he was here he might as well take a look. If there were truly Fire-Glow Crystals he could gather some; Origin-Grade Upper-Level materials were hard to find and often couldn't be bought with money alone.

Yang Flame had complained that the materials she used for setting arrays were too low-grade. The materials Qian Tong sent were Origin-Grade but few were Upper-Level, and Void King-Grade items were even rarer.

"Fine material, but you need the means to get it," the middle-aged man said with a meaning Yang Kai didn't grasp, "Many are rushing there now—conflicts may break out. Are you sure you want to go?"

He seemed to be hinting at Yang Kai's low cultivation level as a warning.

He meant it with no malice or ulterior motive; he was truly offering advice.

"He's a good man," Yang Kai thought, and quickening his pace he chuckled, "I'll go take a look—if I can't get any, at least I'll get some experience."

Seeing Yang Kai determined, the man remained silent. They were strangers passing by; being cautioned once was already an act of kindness—no need to nag further.

The three did not exchange names or attempt to make acquaintances.

After a short while they arrived and all three were stunned.

Ahead stood a huge hill, ten or more zhang high and roughly a hundred zhang across; at least thirty cultivators who had rushed in from various places were digging across its surface.

Periodically someone would laugh heartily, pulling out chunk after chunk of red crystal stones from their pits—some large, some small.

Yang Kai could see clearly—they were indeed Fire-Glow Crystals.

That unremarkable hill turned out to produce Fire-Glow Crystals; he wondered who first found it and how the news leaked.

It was obvious the hill had been dug for hours; pits and hollows scarred its surface, and within those holes figures bustled about.

There were both joyful and disappointed faces—some cultivators had nothing and trudged off to search elsewhere.

Although lively, no conflicts had broken out—everyone kept to themselves, each finding a spot to hunt for Fire-Glow Crystals; the brawling Yang Kai had imagined did not occur.

"Over there!" The middle-aged man who had arrived with Yang Kai suddenly pointed at a neglected spot and, along with his comrade, dashed over and produced a Secret Treasure, using it as a makeshift shovel to dig.

Yang Kai sighed faintly and slowly walked up, finding a place no one seemed to care about, hoping for a stroke of luck.

If only he had brought the Stone Puppet—then he wouldn't need to do a thing; he could just send out the puppet and half the Fire-Glow Crystals hiding in the hill would fall into his hands.
