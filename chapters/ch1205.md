## Chapter 1205 — Solidified Space

That day, Yang Kai arrived before a canyon. He halted his steps and looked toward the gorge ahead, his brows tightly furrowed.

The gorge was only two or three zhang across, flanked by mountains rising tens of thousands of ren high, as if some tremendous divine power had split the range clean in two.

Yang Kai stood there hesitating for the length of an incense stick before resolving to force his way through the gorge.

Although the gorge looked dangerous, going around it would have cost him at least several days, and he had no desire to detour; he could only press on, confident he could handle a certain amount of risk, otherwise he would never have ventured into such a place.

In the flightless Flowing Flame Sandland, such terrain was the perfect place for ambushes; if both mouths of the gorge could be blocked, even the greatest talents trapped inside would be doomed.

That said, cultivators who entered the Flowing Flame Sandland did so for various benefits; murder and pillage occurred often enough, but who would be so bored as to set ambushes in such a place?

Yang Kai reckoned that, apart from himself, no one else would take this route, so he boldly and confidently stepped into the gorge.

The ravine was long—looking from one end to the other it spanned at least a dozen li—such a landform appearing in the Flowing Flame Sandland was indeed strange.

The first few li passed without incident, but after he had gone roughly half that distance, blinding flames suddenly burst from cracks in the ground, each blaze carrying shocking surges of energy; as soon as the lights appeared they closed in on Yang Kai from front and rear, writhing and shifting until they took shape as one Fire Spirit Beast after another, each grotesque and ferocious, snapping and lunging at him.

Yang Kai's expression was cold; the Demonic Flame sword in his hand rolled with power, and his Purple Shield condensed into a violet light that hovered behind him; he paid no heed to the Fire Spirit Beasts attacking from the rear, instead cleaving at those charging from the front.

He had expected this, which was why he had hesitated a moment before entering the valley.

There was no one hiding here to ambush him, true, but there were Fire Spirit Beasts; if he did not slaughter them all, he would not be able to leave the gorge.

The Purple Shield behind him rang with countless metallic sounds as the beasts' bites were repelled, and the Demonic Flame sword in his hand smoothly plunged into the eye of a lion-shaped Fire Spirit Beast. With a brutal twist the Demonic Flame surged into the creature's body, making its crimson glow ripple with black; that darkness spread quickly across its form, turning the once-brilliant red into an eerie blend of black and crimson.

A Seventh-Tier Fire Spirit Beast could be slain by Yang Kai with a full-power strike, but there were so many here he could not afford to unleash full strength each time; he had to rely on the Demonic Flame's nature to slowly burn their semi-illusory bodies away.

The Demonic Flame longsword withdrew from the lion’s skull without the slightest pause for its life or death, then immediately slashed down upon another Fire Spirit Beast that had charged up close.

The Demonic Flame clung to its body, already somewhat solid, and quickly burned black blossoms across it that spread to other parts.

The narrow terrain limited Yang Kai's ability to use all his techniques, but it likewise hampered the Fire Spirit Beasts; with only two or three zhang of width, at most five or six could engage him in direct contact while the rest were blocked behind their comrades.

The alternating forces of cold and heat, the coexistence of opposing powers, were beyond what these Seventh-Tier and Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beasts could withstand; one by one those standing before Yang Kai dissolved amid their wails, and chunks of Crystal Stone of varying sizes fell from the air.

While slaying the beasts, Yang Kai still had the leisure to scoop up those valuable Crystal Stones, walking away with a veritable bounty.

There were hundreds of Fire Spirit Beasts in the gorge, but even such numbers could not withstand his slaughter.

These Fire Spirit Beasts were not the ordinary kind found in the valley; each contained a Crystal Stone, so Yang Kai's efforts were not without return.

As time passed, the previously endless tide of Fire Spirit Beasts gradually dwindled, and Yang Kai had advanced nearly a li.

Another beast fell beneath his sword; Yang Kai stepped forward, casually striking to fend off an attack from another Fire Spirit Beast while reaching for a fallen Crystal Stone.

He had repeated that motion countless times and was thoroughly practiced.

Unexpectedly, the step he took seemed to land on something extraordinary; a nameless heaviness suddenly assailed him from all directions, and Yang Kai felt the space around his body stiffen.

His hand, reaching for the Crystal Stone, froze in midair and could not move an inch; even the Demonic Flame sword he had swung halted abruptly, its blade ringing.

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically. Under his stunned gaze, the charging Fire Spirit Beast opened its blood-red maw and bit down on his neck. A beastly roar erupted as searing heat gushed from its mouth, laced with a heavy, burning poison.

Pain flared at his throat—the skin had been broken and the invading fire-poison scorched his neck, bringing a dizzy haze to his head.

While he was stunned, the Fire Spirit Beasts ahead launched a coordinated assault: torrents of fire-serpents and fire-sphere attacks cascaded down upon Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face went ashen; though he did not fully understand what had happened, retreat was no longer an option. He hurriedly poured all his Saint Yuan into his body, forcing himself out of the congealed space, and the Demonic Flame burst ferociously from within him, making him look like a burning man.

Boom, boom, boom...

A series of explosions sounded, light blazing; several beasts that had latched onto Yang Kai were flung backward, whimpering, and burned to ash by the Demonic Flame while still in mid-air.

When the flames died down, Yang Kai staggered into view, a sorry sight. His face was livid, his clothing torn to rags, and bite marks speckled his throat, cheeks, and wrists; black clots of fire-poison gathered in the wounds, curling like dark vapour.

Under pressure from Yang Kai's Saint Yuan, the fire-poison was expelled, and the injuries quickly healed thanks to the powerful regenerative effects of his Golden Blood.

Yang Kai fixed his mind on that patch of space before him, his expression graver than ever.

A single misstep had nearly cast him into an abyss from which there was no return; had he been a moment slower to break free, he would have suffered far worse harm.

Yet the moment he stepped back, everything returned to normal.

He had no time to ponder why that space was so strange and could only steel himself to deal with the Fire Spirit Beasts attacking from front and rear.

With the matter weighing on his mind, Yang Kai struck with even greater savagery; within a single day he cleared the gorge of its original beasts, harvesting some four to five hundred Crystal Stones.

Such a haul was staggering—likely surpassing what most forces who remained in the first Heat-Flame Zone to hunt Fire Spirit Beasts could obtain.

After all, the Fire Spirit Beasts in the First Layer's Heat-Flame Zone were neither numerous nor high in grade, and the Crystal Stones they yielded were naturally of little worth.

Pausing briefly to rest, Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense to probe the area; after confirming there were no lingering dangers, he stepped forward again.

The same sensation as before struck him the instant he moved: as he crossed that one step he involuntarily groaned and felt his upright frame suddenly compress, as if a mountain had fallen upon him, nearly unbearable.

Moreover, the space there was thick and viscous, clearly distinct from the surrounding void. Yang Kai had cultivated spatial power and had not had time to sense it while fighting the beasts; now that he investigated, he immediately discerned the peculiarity of that region.

What had happened here in the past he could not say, nor why this patch of space had changed, but within this gorge there existed a strange area spanning more than ten zhang in front of him.

If moving before felt like swimming through water, entering this domain was like the water turning to solid ice.

That solidified spatial force could bind anyone fast in place, rendering them immobile; were Yang Kai not well-versed in spatial power, he would never have noticed it.

This was not a trap or formation, but a peculiarity of space itself.

Yang Kai found even breathing here was agonizingly difficult; the air seemed coagulated, and he had to expend great effort to draw it into his lungs.

Yet why were the Fire Spirit Beasts unaffected, able to move freely within it?

Yang Kai could not quite understand.

Bent low and struggling to straighten, sweat beaded big on Yang Kai's brow; flesh and blood twitched and spasmed as he summoned every ounce of strength but still could not lift a foot.

The sweat on his forehead did not drip down but, upon leaving his skin, was crushed into dust by the congealed spatial force and dispersed into the air.

He pressed his Saint Yuan harder, but to his horror the Demonic Flame that should have flared about his body remained suppressed within his meridians, utterly immobile.

Relying on Saint Yuan alone, he could not move through this place.

A flash of insight came to Yang Kai; he ceased pouring Saint Yuan and instead condensed spatial power.

The massive oppressive force around him suddenly eased; though he could not fully recover, he could at least move his limbs very slowly.

Truly, one must apply the right remedy—the space here had clearly mutated, and only spatial power could contend with it.

Moreover, the moment he used spatial power, Yang Kai felt an extraordinary resonance with the bizarre space, and a wondrous understanding washed over him, raising his comprehension of spatial power to a new level.

This filled him with ecstatic joy.
