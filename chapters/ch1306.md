## Chapter 1306 — Persuasion

Yang Kai had thought this would be troublesome, but to his surprise the Artifact Spirit was now sleeping inside the refining furnace; although it still bore injuries, they were not as severe as he had imagined, and it even seemed to have absorbed a trace of Sun's True Essence, quietly refining it within itself.

That single thread of Sun's True Essence was visible to the naked eye, writhing inside the Artifact Spirit like a little snake, exceedingly slender; try as it might to dart this way and that, it could not break free from the Artifact Spirit's restraints and was gradually being assimilated by the spirit-fire within the Artifact Spirit's body.

The Artifact Spirit actually looked as if it had benefited from the misfortune.

This filled Yang Kai with joy; after all, both of his capable assistants had been injured when they absorbed the Sun's True Essence this time, which had vexed him greatly. Now that the Artifact Spirit was fine and the Stone Puppet had no major harm, Yang Kai could finally put his long-held worries to rest.

With the Artifact Spirit in such a state, it would likely be impossible to use the artifact furnace to refine the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl for the time being. Yang Kai simply sat down where he was, adjusting his breath while examining the gains from this trip.

Besides the large number of Saint Crystals and rare minerals stored in the four Spatial Rings he had given to Yang Yan, there were many of the same things inside the Stone Puppet's belly; beyond those, he had also gathered a number of cultivation manuals and numerous Secret Treasures originally belonging to Guyang Sect from that hidden grotto.

The Secret Treasures need no further mention — they would be handed over to Yang Yan for processing. Many of those treasures required repair before they could be used again, and since he didn't presently need other treasures to increase his combat power, he naturally paid them no mind.

But he was interested in those cultivation manuals.

After all, two thousand years ago, the Guyang Sect had been no weaker than great forces like the Battle Sky Alliance or the Leitai Sect. The cultivation methods and secret arts within the sect could not possibly have been inferior — all the more so for those stored within this secret chamber, which most likely held connections to the very inheritance of the Guyang Sect itself.

After a careful review, Yang Kai was inwardly shocked.

As he had suspected, none of these manuals were anything but masterworks; any one that fell into the outside world would attract many martial artists' interest. Among them were some of Guyang Sect's closely guarded secret techniques, of exceptionally high grade and profoundly subtle — even a cultivator at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm might be greatly tempted by them.

With the assets Yang Kai currently possessed, there was no need to waste time and effort cultivating all of them. Of course, if time allowed, he could pick one or two sets of secret techniques to practice; this would not only strengthen his combat power but also increase his chances of survival when danger came.

At the very least, Yang Kai was genuinely interested in several of those secret techniques.

But thinking of how he now had to cultivate the Golden Blood Threads, refine the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl, cultivate spatial power, and still process the Glazed Pearl Daiyuan had given him, Yang Kai extinguished the notion and silently put these manuals away for future use.

Although he had no intention of practicing them now, studying the profundities of a few of those manuals still inspired him greatly, especially one set devoted to body-tempering cultivation, which stirred him the most.

It was the first time he had known such an art existed in the world — a method dedicated purely to refining the body and strengthening the physique.

The reason his physical body was so formidable was twofold: first, because his Indomitable Golden Body had once given birth to a vast amount of demonic qi, granting him certain physical traits of the Demon Race; and second, because of the countless fortuitous encounters he had gained over the years, which had forged the strength of his body as it was now.

But thinking about it again, the Indomitable Golden Body technique he had obtained when he first began cultivating was also, in essence, a body-refining method. However, since it was a technique created by the Great Demon God himself, it naturally could not be compared to the secret body-refining arts preserved within the Guyang Sect’s hidden troves.

It wasn't that the Great Demon God lacked talent, but he only cultivated to the Saint King Realm and never left Tongxuan Continent; in terms of vision and experience he could not compare to a grand sect with countless years of accumulated inheritance.

Yang Kai did not know the exact grade of Guyang Sect's body-tempering art, but after some comprehension he could tell it was of no low order — it was likely a priceless treasure. Such a manual would be worth cultivating. With his status as an Origin-Grade alchemist, he could also concoct pills that aided body-tempering, which would make progress twice as fast; the lower levels wouldn't take too much time.

Resolving it in his heart, Yang Kai stopped pondering and sat cross-legged to continue tempering his Golden Blood Threads, taking time to study the mysteries of that body-tempering technique in between.

Time flew by; seven or eight days passed.

During that period the little mountain range was unusually quiet and nothing occurred. No wonder — this place was close to Zangxiong Valley; ordinarily people would not come this far. If it had been a thousand or two thousand years ago the situation would have been different: many would head deep into Zangxiong Valley seeking treasure, and it would be lively here.

But now, although people did enter Zangxiong Valley, they were few: apart from those like Shen Shitao with fixed objectives, most were greenhorns eager to prove themselves; these youngsters mostly perished within Zangxiong Valley and failed to return safely.

One day, as Yang Kai sat in front of his stone cave meditating, his expression shifted; he looked up toward the not-so-distant horizon and saw an azure streak rapidly approaching. The newcomer showed no intention of concealing their trail, and Yang Kai immediately recognized a Star Shuttle was drawing near — it was Shen Shitao.

He calmed his Saint Yuan and waited quietly.

Moments later Shen Shitao flew in and, with a turn of her figure, alighted not far from Yang Kai, smiling as she looked at him.

After these days of recuperation, Shen Shitao had clearly recovered; her face was like a peach blossom, her eyes rippled like water, and a languid charm exuded from her. When she landed a faint fragrance wafted toward Yang Kai, causing him to feel a start.

"Miss Shen." Yang Kai did not rise, merely nodded faintly in greeting, his brow lifting slightly as he said, "You look to be out of danger?"

Shen Shitao pursed her lips and smiled. "Thank you for your concern, Brother Yang. I was never seriously injured; it was only that my Saint Yuan was heavily depleted before, and it has now recovered."

"Good. Tell me, is there anything that brought you here? Are you preparing to depart?"

"Not yet." Shen Shitao shook her head slowly. "Fanlei's injuries this time are neither light nor heavy; he will likely need to remain here a few more days."

"That suits me; I also need a few days' time."

“This time, I came specifically to thank Brother Yang for his two acts of great kindness. The first time is one thing — our lives were not in danger — but without Brother Yang’s help the second time, we might truly never have left Zangxiong Valley alive. This grace, I will remember in my heart. Should there ever come a day when Brother Yang requires my aid, simply come to Qiantian Sect and call upon me — I will never refuse!”

When she spoke she wore a solemn expression; her sincerity was plain to see.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and waved a hand. "I did not do much, I only helped you out of your predicament. That you survived is largely down to your own strength. That Silver Night Thunder Beast could not be sure of killing you without restrictions, so it chose to withdraw."

"Really?" Shen Shitao knit her brows, seeming puzzled. If that were the case the Silver Night Thunder Beast should not have provoked them in the first place. During her recovery she had been considering this question and could not fathom why the beast suddenly withdrew.

She thought it over and could only speculate there might be some connection to Yang Kai. Now that she probed and Yang Kai denied it outright, she couldn't help but doubt whether the Silver Night Thunder Beast's retreat had truly been as he described.

Yang Kai had no intention of dwelling further on the matter; he said coolly, "There's no need to thank me. When travelling one always encounters difficulties. Since we've met, we should help one another — perhaps next time I will be the one who needs Miss Shen's aid."

A coquettish smile crossed Shen Shitao's pretty face and her eyes gleamed as she said happily, "Knowing Brother Yang is truly my good fortune."

"You really think I'm some lucky man?" Yang Kai gave a surprised laugh.

“Giggle…” Shen Shitao let out a charming laugh. “Though such a saying has little basis, I, for one, firmly believe it. If not for sharing in your good fortune, how could I possibly still be standing here speaking with you right now?”

"Fine, think whatever you like." Yang Kai shook his head slowly and did not argue.

"Actually..." Shen Shitao opened her lips as if to speak but hesitated, looking somewhat troubled.

Yang Kai immediately realized she intended to say something delicate and assumed a listening posture.

Seeing this, Shen Shitao slowly said, "I came not only to thank you but to ask whether Brother Yang has any intention of entering a Sect."

"Enter a Sect?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and smiled. "Miss Shen wouldn't be asking me to join Qiantian Sect, would you?"

"Speaking with someone as sharp as Brother Yang is effortless." Shen Shitao bloomed with a smile and nodded. "I do have that idea. You have always cultivated alone with no master to guide you or sect to shelter you. The drawbacks may not show now, but if your cultivation advances further, there will be situations Brother Yang cannot handle alone."

Yang Kai nodded slightly; he knew her reasoning made sense.

For example, he had never heard of the unique force the elite of the Origin Returning Realm possessed before clashing with the warrior Xie Hongwen had brought; he had no elder to tell him of such things. Had he known earlier he would not have been so passive.

Shen Shitao seemed encouraged by Yang Kai's reaction and continued, "Besides, since you've reached the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, your aptitude must be high. At your present level, entering Qiantian Sect won't be an issue. In half a year our Qiantian Sect will hold a trial open to the entire Dark Star; anyone who passes will be admitted to the sect."
