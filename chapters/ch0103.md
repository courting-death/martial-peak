## Chapter 103 — Instantaneous Battle

“You do not yet have that qualification!” Yang Kai roared furiously, his Primordial Qi bursting forth violently from his body. He resembled a blazing fireball, radiating an oppressive heat that forced the air to tremble.

As he spoke, Yang Kai clashed palms with Yuan Lang. With a muffled impact, Yang Kai staggered backward, while Yuan Lang let out a startled cry and was flung away by the force.

Retreating three steps, Yang Kai instantly found himself surrounded by the other three. As three attacks converged upon him, he quickly ducked to evade a strike from another Separation and Union Realm expert, simultaneously exposing his back to the Blood Battle Gang disciple with the weakest strength.

With both palms pressing forward like a mountain-crushing tide, he aimed straight at the chest of the most vigilant among them, Senior Brother Cai.

It was this very man who had just warned Yuan Lang, preventing him from falling into Yang Kai’s trap.

Among the four, led by him, their strength was naturally the greatest. Even with their cultivation sealed, he still possessed the power of two stages within the Qi Movement Realm. Yang Kai resolved then and there: he must kill him first! Once he was dead, the remaining three would be no threat.

Within a single breath, Yang Kai had engaged all four in various forms of combat.

Senior Brother Cai frowned as he saw Yang Kai recklessly charging at him, disregarding his own safety. Though uncertain of Yang Kai’s intent, a foreboding feeling stirred within him.

There must be a profound secret hidden within those palms!

Retreat! Cai was decisive. Though skeptical that Yang Kai could truly harm him, caution prevailed, and he immediately stepped back, raising his hand to strike at Yang Kai’s advancing palms, hoping to test his opponent’s strength.

Before his palm could fully extend, he noticed a cold, sinister smile curling at the corner of Yang Kai’s mouth.

This is bad—he’s fallen into a trap!

The next moment, he saw Yang Kai’s palms shift left and right, bypassing his block with a fearless, death-defying stance, still pressing toward his chest.

His two palms would surely strike him, but his own attack would also land on Yang Kai! Was this a deliberate exchange of wounds?

Before the thought could fully form, Yang Kai’s palms underwent a new transformation. The burning hands suddenly turned blood red, as if coated with some viscous liquid, the scorching heat intensifying to a new level.

There was no way to dodge! A ruthless gleam flashed in Senior Brother Cai’s eyes as he rapidly circulated his Primordial Qi. This strike would decide who lived and who died!

Two sharp impacts sounded.

Senior Brother Cai’s palm struck Yang Kai’s chest, while simultaneously Yang Kai’s double palm pressed into Cai’s own chest.

In an instant, the Primordial Qi guarding Cai’s chest roared turbulently, as if his chest was about to be melted away.

This young man’s Primordial Qi was incredibly pure! Shocked, Cai thought that if his own realm were not higher, this strike might have seriously injured him.

Before he could fully process his astonishment, a wave of scorching heat radiated again from Yang Kai’s palms.

Accompanied by this heat, Cai’s chest throbbed with intense pain, as if pierced through, his internal organs churning violently.

“Get away from me!” Cai roared in fury, unleashing a palm force that sent Yang Kai flying like a broken sack.

Before Yang Kai could land, the weakest Blood Battle Gang disciple behind him thrust a sword forward. At the critical moment, Yang Kai twisted his body, and the blade pierced through his shoulder, leaving a bloody hole.

But it was not over. Seizing the opportunity while Yang Kai was wounded, another Separation and Union Realm expert landed a kick on Yang Kai’s ribs, sending him hurtling through the air.

Earlier, Yang Kai had dodged his strike, causing him some humiliation. Now, he struck without mercy.

As Yang Kai flew, a bottle suddenly slipped from his chest and fell to the ground.

Midair, Yang Kai spat a mouthful of blood, staggering as he landed. He glanced ruefully at the fallen bottle but dared not retrieve it. Suddenly, a fiery glow erupted beneath his feet, and he vanished into the forest like lightning.

Yuan Lang witnessed everything and hurried forward to pick up the bottle.

Yang Kai’s laughter echoed from afar: “Hahaha, Blood Battle Gang, Separation and Union Realm—nothing more!”

Why is he running? The Blood Battle Gang members exchanged glances. Yang Kai had called them over with his roar, standing here arrogantly and full of swagger. Earlier, his tone had been so brazen, and they had assumed he had some trump card. Yet now, he fled.

Was it all thunder and no rain? They had truly overestimated him. Watching the direction of his escape, they sneered.

“Chase him! He’s badly wounded and won’t last long!” Yuan Lang spat angrily, shaking his palm. He had suffered a minor loss in the clash with Yang Kai, not expecting his palm force to be so difficult to counter. By the time he managed to neutralize it, the fight was already over.

No more than three breaths had passed—the speed was astonishing.

With that, Yuan Lang immediately gave chase toward Yang Kai’s direction, the others following closely behind.

But before they had taken more than a few steps, a heavy thud sounded behind them. Surprised, they turned to see Senior Brother Cai lying face down in the dirt, motionless.

“Senior Brother, what happened to you?” Yuan Lang called out, but there was no response.

“What’s going on?” The weakest disciple was equally baffled.

Just moments ago, Cai had exchanged a single palm strike with Yang Kai, trading blows. Surely, he should not have been severely injured?

“This is not right!” The third man frowned and hurried back, turning Cai’s body over. Suddenly, he let out a startled cry.

“What’s wrong with Senior Brother Cai?” Yuan Lang asked as he approached, his eyes widening in disbelief.

Cai’s skin was flushed red, the blood beneath boiling fiercely. His eyes bulged grotesquely, resembling the dead Nu Lang lying nearby.

At this moment, Cai’s breath was gone. A finger-sized hole in his chest oozed a steady stream of bright red blood.

“It’s so hot!” The Blood Battle Gang disciple holding Cai’s body hastily set it down.

Upon contact with the ground, the corpse suddenly burst open, spewing scalding blood that splattered across the earth, rising in a mist of blood vapor.

The three survivors were drenched head to toe, their expressions horrified. They could never have imagined that their strongest comrade would die so mysteriously!

How did he die? When did Yang Kai strike?

The three stood dumbfounded, staring at their fallen brother who was beyond death, their faces a mixture of shock and disbelief.

Four Blood Battle Gang experts had united against Yang Kai, yet in an instant, he had turned the tables and slain one of them. Though wounded by a sword, a kick, and a palm strike, he had escaped.
