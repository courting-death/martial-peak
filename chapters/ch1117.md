## Chapter 1117 — You won't kill me to silence me, will you?

Yang Yan continued, "Finding veins is only one of the Stone Puppet's abilities. It has another power every artificer dreams of — it can temper the essence of ore. With its help an artificer no longer needs to laboriously refine ores; the Stone Puppet can easily accomplish it, and does so far better than any artificer."

Pill refining requires condensing medicinal liquids, and artifact refining requires tempering ores—both are processes of removing impurities and retaining the essence. This step is indispensable in both pill refinement and artifact refinement.

The cleaner the impurities are removed, the finer the Pills and Secret Treasures produced will be. More often than not, one can judge a true craftsman's level by how well they purge impurities.

In this respect, both Yang Kai and Yang Yan are outstanding in their respective fields.

But the Stone Puppet is born with the ability to purge impurities and temper ore, and its tempering is the most thorough — superior to any artificer — which is why Yang Yan is so interested in the little thing.

What Yang Kai did not know was that the Stone Puppet also had another title — the artificer's strongest assistant!

Whether it was its talent for finding veins or its ability to temper ore, both were exactly what artificers most needed.

An ordinary non-artificer like Yang Kai possessing a Stone Puppet made Yang Yan's eyes go red with jealousy; it felt like a precious pearl placed in foul hands, a robbery of heaven's bounty — how wonderful it would be if that Stone Puppet were hers.

"Go on, does it have anything else?" Yang Kai smiled broadly; the more he looked at the little creature the more fond he became. He hadn't expected one of the two Jet-Black Spheres he brought back from the Tongxuan Continent to hatch such an extraordinary being.

"Since it's a puppet, it can naturally be used in battle!" Yang Yan sighed, "You know artificers are like alchemists — their personal combat ability isn't strong. The Stone Puppet compensates for that perfectly; it was essentially born for artificers."

Yang Yan herself wasn't all that interested in fighting, so she didn't go into much detail.

Yang Kai frowned at the small thing on the ground, unable to imagine how it would fight. A puppet no bigger than the palm — even if it had combat ability it would be limited, right? Unless it dug tunnels? It was indeed superb at burrowing.

"Brother Yang Kai…" Yang Yan blushed and cooed in a sweet voice.

Yang Kai, lost in thought, shivered and glared at her. "Speak properly!"

Yang Yan was not the sort who usually acted coquettish; this affectation only made her lose some of her natural charm.

"Can your Stone Puppet—"

"No!" Yang Kai cut her off before she finished.

Yang Yan pouted, "I hadn't even finished talking yet."

"I know what you're thinking — you want it?" Yang Kai chuckled, "Impossible. I've already formed a link with it; even if I gave it to you it would only obey my commands."

"You actually tamed it?" Yang Yan's eyes widened in disbelief. "How did you tame it? Stone Puppets are hard to tame unless… unless you raised it from before it fully matured."

"A child can be taught!" Yang Kai grinned; he'd raised it for many years, and in the end expended a drop of Golden Blood to forge that delicate bond.

"I'm furious!" Yang Yan stamped her foot hard. She had hoped to get the Stone Puppet, but upon hearing Yang Kai had already tamed it, her desire faded.

Because the Stone Puppet had little intelligence, once it recognized someone it couldn't be taken by another unless it was destroyed.

Seeing Yang Yan's disappointed face, Yang Kai cleared his throat and proudly said, "Although it only obeys me, if you want to use it to temper ores I can lend it to you. I don't forge things anyway."

"Really?" Yang Yan immediately cheered and clapped, "Wonderful! With it I can temper your shield up to Origin-Grade Middle-Level! The Secret Treasures I forge afterward will be of the finest quality. Brother Yang Kai, you're the best — I'm so lucky to follow you."

She was overjoyed.

"Come, let me see how it tempers ore." Yang Kai's curiosity flared; hearing Yang Yan was one thing, but he wanted to witness it himself.

"It's simple, watch." Yang Yan produced an Origin-Grade ore from her Spatial Ring — a chunk of Tianqing Stone the size of a human head, the same Tianqing Stone Yang Kai had bought in Tianyun City last time for her to forge an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure.

"Little one, come over, sister has something tasty." Yang Yan waved the Tianqing Stone at the Stone Puppet.

The Stone Puppet sprang from Yang Kai's shoulder and bounded onto the Tianqing Stone.

Yang Kai heard a crackling sound; in less than a breath the human-head-sized Tianqing Stone was consumed completely by the Stone Puppet, yet its belly showed no sign of swelling — it remained as small as before.

Yang Kai gaped in astonishment. "So fast?"

Yang Yan was elated too. Although she knew the Stone Puppet's secret, it was her first time witnessing a living thing do it; after it finished, the Stone Puppet put the Tianqing Stone on the ground.

"And now?" Yang Kai asked.

"Wait a moment."

The two of them watched the Stone Puppet closely.

Soon Yang Kai noticed the puppet's surface lost some of its luster, as if something seeped out of its body and coated its smooth stone exterior.

Moments later the Stone Puppet turned dull and gray, utterly devoid of sheen.

It gave a light shake and the gray, stony layer flaked off its body, falling to the ground in countless pieces.

Yang Yan explained, "Those are the impurities hidden inside the Tianqing Stone; all the essence has been condensed out of it."

Then, smiling kindly, she told the Stone Puppet, "Now spit the material back out."

The Stone Puppet stood there foolishly, unmoved.

Yang Yan knew her command hadn't taken effect, so she looked to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai understood and immediately issued an order to the Stone Puppet.

The next moment the Stone Puppet opened its mouth and, miraculously, spat out a fist-sized, utterly impurity-free nugget. Yang Kai's eyes brightened and Yang Yan reached to take it.

Then another nugget was spat out, then another, until like hail they kept coming, clinking together with a bright tinkling.

Yang Kai stood frozen; Yang Yan did too.

The scene before them was unlike what they'd imagined.

After ten breaths a small mountain of ore lay before them; each piece was crystal clear, glowing with an ethereal halo, and among them one stood out with a bluish hue.

The Stone Puppet wobbled in place, appearing somewhat exhausted, and collapsed onto the ground.

But Yang Kai and Yang Yan's minds were no longer on it; they stared dumbly at the miniature mountain of ore.

"Yang Yan, the Stone Puppet ate one ore and produced so many?" Yang Kai felt foolish for asking.

"Impossible." Yang Yan was at a loss for words. She picked up the lone bluish piece from the pile, sensed it and said, "This is definitely Tianqing Stone — it must be the one I gave it. It was tempered perfectly, without any impurity."

Yang Kai hastily picked up a piece and inspected it. After a moment his expression changed and he exclaimed, "This isn't Tianqing Stone — this is Ethereal Crystal!"

"Ethereal Crystal?" Yang Yan's face changed; she hurriedly grabbed a piece and trembled, "It really is Ethereal Crystal!"

They had both been stunned by the Stone Puppet's display and hadn't paid attention to what kind of ore it produced until now.

The two of them exchanged a glance, their hearts stirred into a storm.

If asked which ore in the world was the most precious no one could give a single answer, but there was no denying Ethereal Crystal was among the rarest and most valuable minerals!

Ethereal Crystal is extremely difficult to collect because it lacks its own vein; it appears as an accessory mineral of a kind of vein called Kongming Stone veins. Kongming Stone itself is of little value — sometimes used by artificers — but the Ethereal Crystals that accompany it are a different matter: they are high-value materials used in Spatial Rings and space arrays.

Often an entire Kongming Stone vein that yields a basin-sized Ethereal Crystal would be considered rich; many veins yield none. Finding Ethereal Crystal depends on luck — if fortune favors you you'll find some, if not you'll get nothing.

Because demand is immense and yield tiny, Ethereal Crystal's price has only climbed.

And now, a small mountain of Ethereal Crystal lay before Yang Kai and Yang Yan, fist-sized pieces numbering at least three to four hundred.

Even Yang Kai was moved by such an astronomical fortune; one piece of Ethereal Crystal could be exchanged for at least fifty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals, its value rivaling an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure.

There was no reason for a Stone Puppet to produce so many Ethereal Crystals from one Tianqing Stone; the only explanation was that it had stored them inside its belly beforehand.

"Yang Kai…" Yang Yan's voice trembled, "Has the little thing ever been to any veins before?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "I've only been training it the past few days. It had been inside that Jet-Black Sphere before, though lately it has been going underground a lot!"

Yang Yan involuntarily swallowed and, in a small voice, asked, "You mean…"

Yang Kai inhaled deeply and answered her with certainty.

Yang Yan covered her mouth, afraid she'd scream. Hundreds of fist-sized Ethereal Crystals were shocking enough; now to learn such an unbelievable fact made it all the more so.

She suddenly looked at Yang Kai with tears in her eyes: "Yang Kai, you won't kill me to silence me, will you?"
