## Chapter 1007 — Pointing Out a Clear Path

The mysterious elder's cultivation pierced heaven and earth; with a single thought, the state of the entire continent could not escape his perception.

He discovered something strange about Yang Kai.

His Divine Sense rapidly converged toward the cave where Yang Kai was.

Inside the cave, Yang Kai—who was attempting to refine a Saint King-Grade Pill—suddenly stiffened, opened his eyes, and sharply looked upward, his expression grave.

In the dimness he felt as if an invisible pair of eyes were peering at his actions, which made him involuntarily tense.

But after careful inspection there was nothing wrong; he shook his head in bafflement, unsure whether he had been overly jumpy.

Because of that pause, the Saint King-Grade Pill he was trying to refine immediately failed; a scorched odor rose from the alchemy furnace, and the medicinal liquids he had painstakingly condensed mingled together and became unusable.

Yang Kai sighed softly, scooped the ruined medicinal liquid out of the furnace, refrained from using Divine Sense Fire for the time being, and closed his eyes to recuperate.

Taking all of this in, the mysterious elder, thousands of miles away, retracted his Divine Sense and murmured suspiciously, "So sensitive?"

He believed that by his means that brat could not possibly have detected his Divine Sense probe, yet he remained on guard—this was clearly an instinctive sensitivity to the coming of danger.

Shaking his head, the elder no longer paid attention to Yang Kai and returned to handling his own affairs.

He wouldn't concern himself too much with a junior martial artist like Yang Kai.

Inside the cave, Yang Kai shut his door and continued refining pills.

It was unclear how much time had passed; he had refined several hundred Saint-Grade Middle-Level and Saint-Grade Upper-Level pills, many of which bore Pill Patterns.

His alchemical skill had improved immensely; now he could even concoct Saint King-Grade Pills.

One day, Yang Kai solemnly took out some medicinal ingredients from the Demon God's Secret Codex; each plant contained exceptionally dense energy, all of Saint King-Grade caliber.

He was about to begin refining a Boundary-Breaking Pill!

He knew the prescription for the Boundary-Breaking Pill by heart; it was an existing formula on Tongxuan Continent, and the grade of the pill produced depended on the quality of the ingredients used.

Since he chose Saint King-Grade ingredients, the resulting Boundary-Breaking Pill would naturally be Saint King-Grade.

A few of the required ingredients he did not have on hand, but he found substitutes.

Yang Kai was now a capable alchemist; altering the prescription was a trivial matter for him.

Calm and focused, Yang Kai adjusted his condition to its best and began to work.

His movements flowed like drifting clouds, without the slightest hesitation; his expression was detached—neither nervous nor eager—just as when refining an ordinary Pill.

Because he had complete confidence in producing this Pill!

He did not think he would fail.

Indeed, in no more than half an hour a pale-yellow Boundary-Breaking Pill, its energy restrained within, was produced.

Taking the Pill from the furnace, Yang Kai held it in his hand and silently sensed it; after a moment he slowly shook his head.

This Pill was genuinely a Saint King-Grade Pill.

However, from his observation it should only be of Saint King-Grade Lower-Level quality.

He did not know whether such a Pill could dissolve the seal; if Lü Guichen's strength were at that level, there would be no doubt, but Yang Kai estimated Lü Guichen was at least at the Second Stage or even the Third Stage of the Saint-King Realm.

He had little confidence.

Frowning and pondering for a moment, Yang Kai shoved the Pill into his mouth and swallowed it.

He closed his eyes, sat cross-legged on the ground, and waited for the medicine to take effect.

After a short while Yang Kai's face changed, contorted in extreme pain. He felt surging waves of heat welling in his lower abdomen—those waves struck like lightning and like a raging torrent—bursting forth and sweeping through his limbs and bones.

The obstructed meridians were expanded, and a tearing, rending pain spread through his whole body.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and bore it, his Divine Sense tracking the medicine's flow to perceive his own condition.

He clearly saw chains of illusory shackles appear within his flesh and blood; those shackles were suffused with Lü Guichen's aura—the very sealing he had laid down.

The Boundary-Breaking Pill's effect was like a trapped dragon leaping from its abyss; using Yang Kai's body as the battlefield, it fought a desperate struggle against those shackles.

The entire process brought him unbearable pain.

Although the Pill's effect was considerable, it was clearly insufficient to shatter those shackles and restore Yang Kai's freedom; with each collision and dissolution the medicine's efficacy was drained, while the shackles stood immovable, continually binding Yang Kai's Saint Yuan and meridians.

Half a day later, Yang Kai opened his eyes weakly, his face resigned.

As expected, a Saint King-Grade Lower-Level Boundary-Breaking Pill could not do the job.

But with his present means he could at most refine pills of this grade.

It wasn't the materials, nor his technique, but the limitation of his cultivation realm.

Yang Kai was only at the First Stage of the Saint Realm; being able to cross a major realm to refine pills already testified to the refinement of his artistry—if he wanted to craft higher-grade pills he had to raise his own strength first.

However, Yang Kai did not lose heart; instead his eyes shone.

That ordinary Saint King-Grade Lower-Level Boundary-Breaking Pill failing did not mean a Boundary-Breaking Pill with Pill Patterns would likewise fail.

Once a Pill formed Pill Patterns, the internal potency would increase at least twofold or more.

As long as he could refine a Boundary-Breaking Pill with Pill Patterns, he was confident he could break the seal.

He did not dwell on the previous failure; using Wan Yao Ling Ye he quickly recovered and began again.

He still had many ingredients gathered with Shen Tu; enough to support him in refining four or five Boundary-Breaking Pills.

Yang Kai worked feverishly in the cave; almost every half a day another Boundary-Breaking Pill came out of the furnace.

They were all ordinary Pills—none developed Pill Patterns.

It seemed the difficulty of producing Pill Patterns on Saint King-Grade Pills had increased considerably.

Yang Kai remained unhurried and calm, his mind steady; failures did not affect him, because even if these materials were exhausted he could gather more—on this resource-rich continent medicinal ingredients were inexhaustible.

Realizing this, he felt that even if everything failed it wouldn't be a major problem.

When he took the fifth Boundary-Breaking Pill from the furnace, his eyes instantly brightened and his spirits lifted.

That Pill bore vein-like lines akin to human meridians, restraining its medicinal nature to the extreme and making its effect vast, concentrated, and potent.

Success! Gazing at the painstakingly refined Pill, Yang Kai grinned.

Since Lü Guichen had sealed his cultivation, nearly two months had passed; here he had no one to rely on—only Shen Tu, who had been friendly, still lacked the ability to remove the seal.

He had to depend entirely on himself.

Now that he held a Boundary-Breaking Pill, a strong sense of exhilaration and pride welled up within him.

Yang Kai did not hastily consume the Pill; he recovered once more.

Half a day later he finally tossed the Pill into his mouth, waiting with eager expectation.

Worthy indeed of a Pill bearing Pill Patterns—no sooner had its medicinal power dissolved in his abdomen than fierce torrents of energy surged outward in all directions, the violent commotion several times greater than the last.

Yang Kai's face flushed; his blood rushed and boiled as he endured the inconceivable pain, his expression contorted, yet the eyes he opened gleamed brightly.

He perceived the shackles within his body breaking inch by inch.

The meridians that had been sealed for over two months finally loosened, and the long-stagnant Saint Yuan began to flow.

Crack...

The noise of the shackles shattering resounded deep in his soul; the Saint Yuan flowed faster and faster and his strength began to recover.

At this rate, within the time it takes to prepare a cup of tea the seal would be thoroughly broken.

But at that moment he suddenly stirred; his Divine Sense sharply expanded outward.

He sensed someone approaching nearby and felt a strand of vigilance.

During his pill-refining period there had occasionally been one or two martial artists passing by who detected his life aura, but none had ventured into the cave to cause trouble.

After all, no one dared make trouble in that elder's territory.

However this time seemed different; after the martial artist outside detected Yang Kai's presence he did not leave—he walked straight in.

Yang Kai frowned, displeased.

Although he did not fear being troubled here, having someone interrupt him at such a critical moment was extremely vexing.

He urged the medicine's effect to accelerate, hastening the breaking of the seal, outwardly calm and seated.

Not long after, a sliver of light appeared ahead, and a figure emerged.

The light came from a strange stone, its glow soft yet illuminating a vast area. The cultivator holding the stone walked straight up to Yang Kai, chuckling as he looked him over and sneering, “Well, well, I was wondering who was hiding here—turns out it’s you, brat.”

As he spoke, the stone's radiance cast his face into a somewhat grim and terrifying look.

"Are you He Miao's Senior Brother?" Yang Kai asked him coolly.

He recognized the man; whenever He Miao had tried to come find him recently she had been intercepted by this fellow—Yue Xi called him Wei Wu.

"That's right." Wei Wu nodded in confirmation. "What are you hiding here for, brat? There's nothing worthwhile here."

"Doing nothing; it's dangerous outside."

"It is dangerous—especially for you." Wei Wu sneered with malicious delight, "Lü Guichen sealed your cultivation, didn't he? How pathetic; alone with no one to rely on, you can only hide and scrape by. Tsk tsk, it makes me feel sorry for you just to think about it!"

He mocked in a sinister, sarcastic tone, clearly pleased to see Yang Kai in such a miserable, helpless state.

Yang Kai remained silent.

"Kid, how about I point out a clear path for you?" Wei Wu suddenly crouched down in front of Yang Kai.

"What path?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Look, you're in unfamiliar ground with no protection and your cultivation sealed; if danger comes you have no way to fight back—say some ill-intentioned person approaches you!" he said with a cold laugh, pressing his gaze onto Yang Kai.
