## Chapter 416 — Making a Bet

Hearing Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu claim to be under his command and speaking with such respectful attitudes, Huo Xingchen couldn't help but furrow his brow, sensing instinctively that something was amiss.

The Yang Family Blood Servants Hall's experts didn't seem this friendly to outsiders, did they?

"How about we make a bet?" Yang Kai suddenly proposed, smiling as he looked at Huo Xingchen.

"A bet on what?" Huo Xingchen immediately became interested.

"On whether I can survive tonight!"

Turning to Yang Kai, the Zhongdu Wolf’s expression grew playful, his eyes narrowing slightly as his mind raced.

"Are you scared?" Yang Kai chuckled dryly. "If you’re scared, then don’t follow me here. Be careful not to lose your life tonight. I heard you're the sole heir of the Huo Family; if you die in the battle city, things won’t end well."

"Scared?" Huo Xingchen sneered coldly, "I’ve grown up long enough to know the meaning of fear. If you dare to bet with me, I’ll make you lose convincingly! Don’t you know that I’m best at eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling?"

His face was full of excitement.

"What’s the wager?" Huo Xingchen pressed.

Yang Kai sized him up and down, saying, "You’re penniless right now; I doubt you have anything worth betting?"

Huo Xingchen was momentarily stunned, scratching his head, "That’s true."

"Then let's keep it small," Yang Kai smiled faintly. "If you lose, I don’t want anything from you; you just have to run naked ten laps around the battle city."

"This... isn’t really appropriate, Brother Kai..." Huo Xingchen frowned deeply. Running naked around the battle city would be humiliating beyond belief.

"Your reputation’s already in the gutter; running ten laps won’t make things worse. Debts don’t bother the keen, and fleas don’t itch the thick-skinned," Yang Kai said slyly, raising an eyebrow.

Hearing this, Huo Xingchen couldn’t help but feel this made sense and nodded, "You’re right. But I don’t think I’ll lose. What if you lose? What can you offer me?"

Yang Kai whistled sharply. A loud eagle cry suddenly echoed from the sky!

Immediately, a golden light dove down, and a handsome Golden Feather Eagle landed steadily on Yang Kai’s shoulder, its sharp eyes gleaming.

"If I lose, I’ll give you this!"

Huo Xingchen was ecstatic. If Yang Kai offered some treasure, he might not have been interested—being the sole heir of the Huo Family, he wasn’t short of treasure.

But the Golden Feather Eagle was different. It was a unique Demonic Beast belonging solely to the Yang Family. Not only was its strength considerable, but its appearance alone was enough to make Huo Xingchen very tempted.

In the future, if he could bring a Golden Feather Eagle with him like Yang Kai, it would indeed be a great honor.

The pampered and arrogant young masters liked such things.

"Agreed!" Huo Xingchen hurried to confirm the bet, gazing joyfully at the Golden Feather Eagle, whispering, "Eagle, eagle, after tonight your surname will change to Huo!"

Yang Kai smiled and said nothing.

About a hundred miles from Zhongdu, there stood the battle city.

This city was built by the Yang Family themselves. Although not as prosperous or vast as Zhongdu, it was still quite good. Usually, it was used as an ordinary city, but during the succession war, it turned into a battlefield.

The battle city was octagonal, each corner hosting a mansion prepared for the eight young masters competing in the succession war.

Perhaps for a long time in the future, they would engage in a drawn-out tug of war here.

Looking back on past succession wars, few Yang Family contests ended swiftly. Most were prolonged battles lasting three or five years before a victor emerged.

According to the Yang Family’s recorded seals, a hundred years ago, one progenitor managed to claim victory in less than half a year.

Such an achievement was impressive; after all, the enemies became stronger as the war progressed, making victory harder.

Only with a considerable advantage at the start could one easily defeat the enemies.

The brothers entered the city one after another, and the entire battle city soon buzzed with excitement. Many residents had fled to avoid getting tangled in the succession war.

Those who stayed were daring souls who looked forward to the impending conflict.

After exchanging some pleasantries, the brothers tacitly dispersed, each heading to their mansion.

Yang Kai’s mansion was at the northwest corner, a rather poor location—remote and quiet, but he did not mind.

Only four people walked leisurely to the northwest mansion, where two fresh-faced maids stood guard at the entrance. Inside, some servants waited to be summoned. These were assigned by the Yang Family to serve each young master in daily life. Such treatment was standard for every mansion.

These people were just ordinary and would not influence the war's outcome.

When Yang Kai arrived, the two youthful maidens bowed politely and said, "Greetings, Young Master Kai."

Their tone was not overly warm, just routine. Yet, both Yang Kai and Huo Xingchen subtly noticed the sadness behind the maidens' expressions.

Clearly, they felt hopeless about being assigned to a mansion with no future prospects.

Although servants did not involve themselves in the succession war, they hoped to serve a talented young master. Such a relationship would guarantee their safety and allow them to rise in status if their master succeeded in inheriting the family headship.

Huo Xingchen smiled at Yang Kai, finding it amusing that even these ordinary servants believed he had no future.

Yang Kai remained indifferent, merely nodding slightly and leading Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu into the mansion.

Behind them, Huo Xingchen chuckled lewdly and asked the two young maids, "What are your names, ladies?"

Seeing Huo Xingchen’s lascivious expression, the two maidens paled and backed away hastily.

They knew the reputation of the Zhongdu Wolf well and feared they might not escape this time. But then Yang Kai’s voice came from inside:

"No one in my house is to be touched!"

Huo Xingchen paused, yelling, "Yang Kai, you’re being way too controlling!"

As he spoke, he quickened his pace to catch up, angrily complaining, "There don’t seem to be other beauties around here; what am I supposed to do for fun?"

Yang Kai glanced at him coolly: "There should be brothels in the battle city. As long as you’re not afraid of being caught, you can go live it up!"

"Better to avoid it," Huo Xingchen quickly waved off the suggestion. Choosing Yang Kai as his ally in broad daylight was equivalent to becoming everyone else’s enemy. Going to the brothel now was definitely asking for trouble.

"Who wants to find beauties? Let me show you how it’s done!" Suddenly, a woman’s voice echoed from the mansion’s main hall.

Yang Kai was taken aback by the voice, and Huo Xingchen reflexively ducked his head, then looked dumbfoundedly toward the source.

There appeared a striking woman with bright eyes, flawless white skin, wearing a pale purple long dress. A gentle smile graced her face as she walked forward. Approaching them, she lifted her ample chest and looked at the two with delight.

"Qiu Yimeng?" Huo Xingchen exclaimed.

"I was wondering who was looking for beauties—it turns out to be you, pampered son of privilege!" Qiu Yimeng smiled teasingly at Huo Xingchen, who winced in displeasure. Secretly cursing his bad luck for running into her here, he suddenly grew shocked, as if recalling something.

"Why are you here?" Yang Kai frowned.

Today’s events were strange; Huo Xingchen had become an unlikely ally, and now even Qiu Yimeng had appeared here.

"Aren't your Qiu Family on my Sixth Brother's side?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

The Qiu Family’s Qiu Ziru was indeed aligned with Yang Shen, the sixth brother. When the Qiu Family patriarch, Qiu Shoucheng, was present, he had announced clearly that the Qiu Family were allies of Sixth Brother Yang Shen.

Yang Kai couldn’t understand why Qiu Yimeng would show up at his mansion—and she seemed to have been waiting here for some time.

"The Qiu Family is the Qiu Family, and I am me!" Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly, lifting her smooth chin. "What, aren’t you glad to see me?"

"Beautiful lady, you haven't been kicked out of your family by your father, have you?" Huo Xingchen dared to ask bluntly.

"What do you mean? Be clear," Yang Kai said, still unclear on the matter.

"I'm here to assist you. Isn’t this a succession war? Nothing to be confused about—henceforth, we are allies," Qiu Yimeng said with a charming smile, clearly pleased at Yang Kai’s confusion.

Huo Xingchen rolled his eyes, laughing coldly: "Your father is truly sly to bet on two treasures."

He obviously misunderstood, thinking the Qiu Family was allying with both Yang Shen and Yang Kai. Yet Huo Xingchen himself was full of doubt, unable to comprehend what miraculous quality Yang Kai had to convince the Qiu Family to place half their bets on him. He had only come to play with Yang Kai for thrills, but the Qiu Family’s intentions were serious.

"I said, the Qiu Family is the Qiu Family, and I am myself," Qiu Yimeng shook her head slowly, "This time, I’m not representing the Qiu Family but only myself."

Yang Kai’s mind spun rapidly and soon understood much of the situation, nodding slightly: "I see. How many people do you have?"

Qiu Yimeng smiled bitterly. "The people from Autumn Rain Hall came with me."

Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense, instantly discerning the cultivation strength of every martial artist in the mansion, nodding slightly in approval.

Huo Xingchen snorted disdainfully, "Autumn Rain Hall? That’s the pavilion that accepts only rejects, right? There should be no more than twenty people."

"Correct, it’s the pavilion that takes in the flawed!" Qiu Yimeng glared at Huo Xingchen.

Any Qiu Family martial artist who had suffered severe wounds and could no longer advance in strength was sent to Autumn Rain Hall to do lighter tasks. In the entire hall, only one or two Divine Roaming Realm experts were present, and even those weren't high-level.

The people Qiu Yimeng brought were utterly insufficient to handle the crisis looming tonight.

"Well, at least it’s some strength," Yang Kai said, smiling at her.

Qiu Yimeng pressed her lips into a smile. "I hope you won’t let me down."

"Why are you so optimistic?" Huo Xingchen shook his head. He didn’t understand why these two seemed less concerned about the succession war than himself. Patting his chest, he said, "You have a helper with no power, two heavily weakened Blood Servants, and now a young lady who brought a group of useless people. Yang Kai, you’re truly doomed."
