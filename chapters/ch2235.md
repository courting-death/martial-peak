## Chapter 2235 — Dealing with Deceit

"Hehehe..." Yang Kai struggled to his feet, holding the Soul-Severing Blade aloft and pointing it at the woman from afar. The corners of his mouth curled into a subtle arc as he said, "To receive such praise from Granny, this boy truly feels honored!"

The woman's expression shifted slightly as she replied coldly, "What did you say?"

Yang Kai shook his head, a mocking look on his face. "At this point, you’re still playing dumb? Must I really spell out your identity... Granny You!"

The moment the words "Granny You" left his lips, the woman's expression instantly turned icy cold.

Yang Kai continued, "At first, I was a bit puzzled, not sure where I’d seen you before. I just felt your face looked familiar, but no matter how I racked my brains, I couldn’t recall..."

"So when did you remember?" The woman didn’t deny Yang Kai’s guess, instead asking with interest. The Soul-Devouring Worms gathered around her protective barrier were completely ignored.

"It was just a matter of connecting the dots." Yang Kai grinned. "There were so many people imprisoned in the Heavenly Prison, so why did you only see the martial artists from Qingyang Shrine? Clearly, there was a special reason. Either you knew them, or there was something different about them compared to the local martial artists. But everyone’s spirit bodies are the same, so the only reason you’d see them is because you recognized them and wanted to find something from them... As for what you were looking for, it must have been the Warm Spirit Lotus."

"Earlier, you even spoke Hall Master Wen’s name, and the look of utter hatred you showed in that instant..." Yang Kai smiled faintly. "It’s hard not to let one’s imagination run wild after seeing that."

It was precisely because he vaguely heard the other party call out Wen Zishan’s name that he suddenly figured it out.

The woman before him was none other than Granny You, the one who guarded the Divine Roaming Mirror. That’s why he felt she looked familiar at first glance. Since Granny You had long presided over the Divine Roaming Mirror, she could naturally come and go as she pleased.

It was just that Granny You was old and decrepit, while the woman before him was as beautiful as a flower. At first, Yang Kai hadn’t connected the two at all.

"So you recognized me?"

Yang Kai sneered, "An old hag comes here and transforms into a stunning beauty, and you still have the nerve to call yourself ‘this Lord’?"

Granny You sneered back, "Trying to provoke me? If so, your methods are far too childish."

Seeing his scheme exposed, Yang Kai couldn’t help but purse his lips.

Yang Kai knew very well that facing a powerhouse like Granny You, if they were outside, he might have a sliver of hope. But in this Divine Roaming world, Granny You’s strength would be maximized, and he had no chance of winning or even escaping. He could only hope she’d make a mistake in anger, so he resorted to venomous words—only to be seen through at a glance.

"You’re not completely brainless." Granny You nodded slightly at Yang Kai, her praise genuine. "If I’m not mistaken, you used these Soul-Devouring Worms to break the restriction in your body, didn’t you?"

"So what if I did?" Yang Kai’s attitude suddenly turned arrogant. He pointed the Soul-Severing Blade at Granny You and said, "Old hag, you’d best behave. Since you recognize these Soul-Devouring Worms, you know how fearsome they are. Let me out obediently, or at my command, they’ll devour you until not even your bones remain!"

He spoke as if he could really kill Granny You right here.

"Hmph. If they grew for a few more decades or centuries, maybe I’d fear them a little. But just these Soul-Devouring Worms?" Granny You scoffed, her delicate body trembling as she shook the worms encircling her away.

Many Soul-Devouring Worms were shaken, flying about like headless flies. But soon, they recovered and once again surrounded Granny You.

"Since we’ve spoken so frankly, I’ll be direct with you." Granny You ignored the Soul-Devouring Worms outside her body and said to Yang Kai, "Erase the mark on the Warm Spirit Lotus and hand it over. I promise you won’t be treated unfairly."

"And why should I?" Yang Kai retorted angrily.

"What do you think?" Granny You sneered.

Yang Kai looked helpless, stalling for a while before saying, "Let’s put that aside for now. I want to ask something first."

"What?"

"Granny, how did you know I had the Warm Spirit Lotus? I hid it so well, no one’s ever noticed."

Granny You frowned. "No harm in telling you. I’ve guarded the Divine Roaming Mirror for over two thousand years. Though I can’t make that treasure recognize a master, I’ve studied it a bit. When your spirit bodies passed through the Divine Roaming Mirror to enter this place, I could glimpse your internal conditions. It was then that I caught a fleeting glimpse and discovered something..."

"But you couldn’t be sure, could you? So you didn’t know if you’d seen wrong, nor did you know who actually had the Warm Spirit Lotus. But you did know that after we entered the Divine Roaming Mirror, we’d be heading to Heavenly Yao Mountain for our trial. That’s why you ordered Zhou Dian to lead people to Heavenly Yao Mountain to capture the so-called ‘Calamity Stars’! Once we were all caught and brought back, you could check us one by one..." Yang Kai continued, deducing the rest aloud.

"Exactly! But I thought the Warm Spirit Lotus was on that brat Xia Sheng, or at worst, on Xiao Baiyi. I never expected it to be in the hands of the weakest one—you. Truly a surprise."

Yang Kai nodded, indicating he understood.

He finally understood why so many people were imprisoned in the Heavenly Prison, yet only Xia Sheng and the others, along with himself, were taken out. He also realized what Granny You meant earlier by ‘the last one.’

She checked Xia Sheng and the others and found nothing. When it was his turn, of course he was the last one.

"One more question," Yang Kai suddenly said.

"You’d best not push your luck!" Granny You’s face turned cold.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Granny, if you don’t want to see me destroy the Warm Spirit Lotus, you’d better not talk to me like that. Besides... you’re getting on in years, don’t get so worked up—it’s bad for your health!"

He looked extremely concerned, making Granny You so angry she was fuming, yet helpless.

After glaring at Yang Kai for a while, Granny You finally said darkly, "Boy, you’d best understand your situation."

"I understand perfectly!" Yang Kai gritted his teeth. "I hope Granny will cooperate. Otherwise, if I really destroy my soul, you won’t get anything out of me. We might as well just go our separate ways!"

He kept threatening to destroy his soul, and Granny You really didn’t dare act rashly.

The Warm Spirit Lotus is a supreme treasure of heaven and earth. Over millions of years, it has only occasionally appeared, falling into the hands of the very fortunate.

If the owner of the Warm Spirit Lotus dies, the lotus doesn’t disappear. Instead, it absorbs the previous owner’s soul energy and remains in the world, waiting for the next fated person.

When Yang Kai obtained the Warm Spirit Lotus, it was only in its three-colored form. At that time, it preserved the previous owner’s soul energy, which greatly benefited Yang Kai.

Although the Warm Spirit Lotus doesn’t vanish with its owner’s death, if one uses a special method like soul destruction, detonating the martial artist’s divine soul origin, it can be erased from the world.

Granny You’s strength far surpassed Yang Kai’s. Even with the Soul-Severing Blade and the Soul-Devouring Worms, if she truly wanted to attack, how could he escape?

The only reason she didn’t act rashly was that she feared Yang Kai might, in desperation, destroy the Warm Spirit Lotus along with himself.

Earlier, Yang Kai had all his strength sealed and his soul assaulted by her methods, leaving him powerless to resist. But now that he was free, he had a real chance to use soul destruction.

Granny You stared deeply at Yang Kai for a long time before closing her eyes. When she opened them again, she was calm.

"This is the last question. Don’t push your luck."

"Of course!" Yang Kai grinned. "If Granny cooperates, I won’t act recklessly."

"That’s for the best!" Granny You nodded.

Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn. He said in a deep voice, "Granny, what do you want the Warm Spirit Lotus for?"

At this, Granny You frowned, her face frosty, and fell silent.

Yang Kai said, "It can’t be just to nourish your soul. Earlier, you said some things that made it sound like, with the Warm Spirit Lotus, you could harm Hall Master Wen. Let me put it another way..." In that instant, Yang Kai’s gaze turned razor-sharp, locking onto Granny You’s eyes. "That so-called Mirror Soul... what is it? Why does it need the Warm Spirit Lotus as a vessel?"

As soon as he said this, a vicious look appeared on Granny You’s pretty face, and a murderous aura began to seep out.

"Granny, we had a deal. If you go back on your word, don’t blame me for doing the same. If you’re heartless, I won’t be righteous either. If I destroy the Warm Spirit Lotus, don’t come crying to me!" Seeing her hesitate, Yang Kai hurried her.

Granny You was so furious she laughed. "You really dare destroy it? If you do, go ahead and try. I’ll be watching!"

She suddenly put on a look as if she were watching a show. Yang Kai couldn’t help but touch his nose and shake his head. "Anyway, Granny, don’t push me. If you do, I’ll destroy it!"

"Hmph! Brat!" Granny You cursed angrily, clearly in a foul mood.

For a powerhouse like her, being threatened by Yang Kai was naturally infuriating.

After a long silence, she finally gritted her teeth and said, "You should know, in this world, some Secret Treasures, through countless years and coincidences, give birth to their own will. These special wills are called Artifact Spirits!"

Hearing her explanation, Yang Kai perked up and listened intently, nodding. "Of course I know that."

Liu Yan was an Artifact Spirit, so Yang Kai was quite familiar with this.

"Secret Treasures with Artifact Spirits often possess immense power, far surpassing those without. But though there are countless Secret Treasures in the world, only a few can give birth to Artifact Spirits. Artifact Spirits themselves are extremely rare."
