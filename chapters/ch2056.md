## Chapter 2056 — The Yao Worm Wielding Twin Swords

Shentu and the others came roaring in with overwhelming momentum; they had assumed Yang Kai would be utterly helpless at the brink of his ascension, yet to their astonishment a full half of their own Void King Realm warriors fell dead in a single encounter — such a turn of events naturally left the survivors trembling in sheer terror.

But it was not over: immediately after the Moon Blade, a streak of multicolored radiance shot forward with a sharp hiss; before the attack even arrived, the fierce qi alone chilled the skin of the remaining fighters, making cold sweat bead upon their brows.

“Sword qi!” Shentu's expression shifted; at a glance he recognized that the iridescent glow concealed sword qi of the sharpest edge, and astonishingly it embodied all five elements — metal, wood, water, fire, and earth — each present and none missing, resonating with and enhancing one another under their mutual cycles of generation and restraint.

His face instantly grew grave. With a roar the stout figure swelled abruptly, his corpulent body seeming to grow in size as an inky-black aura billowed out from him, enveloping his whole form.

In the next instant countless black tendrils sprouted from his body, waving in all directions and sweeping up the incoming sword qi beneath their assault.

A series of violent energy impacts resounded as the tendrils Shentu had extended from his body were shredded into tatters beneath the countless waves of sword qi; yet at the same time, those razor-like currents were all held at bay, unable to seize the chance to take a single life.

The many Void King Realm warriors whose lives he'd saved looked at him with gratitude; one of them, his heart still racing, even fawned over Shentu with conspicuous flattery.

“Brat, daring to attack this old man at the brink of ascension — you're courting death. Very well, then give me your life!” Shentu bellowed, and a small shield with a ghost head appeared in his hand. Though small in size, the ghost head carved upon it was lifelike, with a bluish face, fangs and a ferocious leer.

He funneled Origin Qi into the Ghost-Head Small Shield and it slowly transformed into a true ghost head; it opened against the wind, swelling until it was the size of a house, and surged straight toward Yang Kai.

As it charged, the ghost head's jaws opened and shut, spewing forth clusters of silver ghost-fire from its maw, firing like a volley of arrows — an extraordinarily fearsome sight.

Seeing this, Yang Kai's eyes narrowed, yet he remained seated in place without so much as a twitch.

The clusters of silver ghost-fire arrived before Yang Kai in the blink of an eye, striking his body directly and battering the area around him into chaos.

“Huh?” Shentu was taken aback, full of bewilderment — he had not expected to so easily have Yang Kai wiped out. He knew the potency of his own Secret Treasure well: already a fearsome, mysterious attack, augmented by his secret techniques, it could scorch a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator and, if not kill, strip away flesh and blood.

Yang Kai was only Third Stage of the Void King Realm and at the moment of ascension — after taking so many blows of ghost-fire directly, how could he possibly still be alive?

Thinking so, Shentu nodded slightly, convinced that he had indeed succeeded.

Seeing Yang Kai swallowed by ghost-fire, the remaining Void King Realm men erupted into a string of sneering chuckles, as though mocking Yang Kai's presumptuousness.

Their laughter had not yet died when a shadow flickered where Yang Kai had been, eerily reappearing.

If not Yang Kai himself, then who else could that figure be?

Judging by his expression and condition, he had not been touched by the ghost-fire in the slightest; he had not even moved.

No one could fathom how he had avoided those ghost-fire attacks.

The crowd's laughter died on the spot.

Shentu likewise widened his eyes, his face full of incredulity.

At that moment a speck of golden light glittered in Yang Kai's left eye; the World-Ending Demon Eye manifested, the gold coalescing into the shape of a lotus.

The sight of that lotus sent a cold wave into Shentu's heart. Instinct told him something was wrong, yet inexplicably he could not look away — the lotus seemed to possess a strange attraction that fixed his gaze.

The lotus trembled and vanished from Yang Kai's left eye, only to manifest within Shentu's Sea of Consciousness as a bud opening slowly into bloom, its opening drawn from his own soulforce.

Shentu emitted a sudden, agonized shriek as a pain like ten thousand needles stabbed through his mind; the torment burrowed to the depths of his spirit, nearly impossible to bear.

His scream made the remaining Void King Realm warriors startle and look toward Shentu, eager to see what had befallen him.

At that instant the hiss of tearing air sounded again as Moon Blades, even thicker and larger than before, shot forth in an endless, dense torrent!

Having seen what had happened to their comrades earlier, these men knew all too well the Moon Blade's ferocity; they uttered strange cries and scrambled to disperse.

“Condense!” Yang Kai shouted, and the Power of the Laws surged; centered on him, the space within a hundred zhang seemed to heed some decree, instantly becoming oppressively solid.

The movements of those Void King Realm men slowed to a crawl as if moving like turtles.

Sputter, sputter, sputter...

The Moon Blades casually sliced through the bodies of those men, cleaving them in two; each corpse bore a crescent-shaped wound, the flesh at the gap banished into endless void.

The mangled corpses slumped downward, eyes wide and mouths frozen in a disdainful final expression.

“So this is the Law of Space?” After the strike, Yang Kai showed a pensive look, entirely forgetting the other great enemy still to be dealt with; he fell into a sudden, wondrous Enlightenment — the truth of Spatial Law flooded his mind like a bolt of lightning.

His body trembled and he was stunned; brilliant light flashed in his eyes as thoughts intertwined like lightning, his mind racing through understandings of Spatial Law.

Crackle, crackle...

Spatial fissures formed around him, collapsing and then being mended by the heavenly laws, only to split and collapse again.

The space where he sat seemed to lose stability and vision warped.

“Ah!” A sharp, mournful cry burst forth from not far away — it was Shentu, tortured by the Blooming Lotus secret technique, barely clinging to life.

Ghost-Hand Shentu, a true expert of the Dao Origin Realm, had indeed been struck by Yang Kai's Blooming Lotus secret technique; though a large portion of his soulforce was drained, he managed through sheer force of will to rouse himself at the last moment and avoid immediate death.

Even so, his vital energy was gravely injured.

With so much soulforce leached away his Spirit Essence was damaged; such an injury would not be cured by ordinary Spiritual Pills — only the rarest restorative pills or special techniques, or decades to centuries of cultivation, might repair his Spirit Essence.

He clenched his teeth against the pain in his mind and turned his face in a grimace, looking about, and his heart sank.

He discovered that the Void King Realm warriors he'd brought were now all dead — not a single one remained.

The killer still sat cross-legged where he had been, eyes bright, seemingly lost in some revelation; the space beside him was undergoing strange changes, the wandering spatial fissures like spirit snakes filling a zone dozens of zhang across.

“Spatial Force!” Shentu's eyes narrowed in terror.

This moment should have been the perfect chance to strike — the enemy was lost in comprehension and could not react — but Shentu could not bring himself to charge through that uncanny space. The fissures were sharper than the finest blades and would shred flesh; if he attempted to rush Yang Kai he would likely be torn to pieces by those countless spatial rifts before reaching him.

“So it's Spatial Force! This brat...” At last Shentu understood what sort of foe he had provoked; cold sweat trickled down his brow as he gave Yang Kai a look of loathing, then spun and flew outward, attempting to flee.

He no longer wished to linger here; he only wanted to get as far away as possible.

But before he could flee thirty zhang, crystalline snowflakes began drifting down from the sky — each flake exquisitely beautiful, pure and flawless.

The surrounding temperature plunged abruptly.

Shentu shivered for no reason and felt a breath of death wash over him.

Battle-hardened, Shentu sensed danger and roared; the black qi again burst from his body, wrapping him to ward off the encroaching cold.

Only then did he clearly see the origin of it all: a gigantic yao worm, pure white and crystal-clear throughout, about two zhang tall.

Shentu had no idea when the yao worm had appeared before him; it seemed to have always been there, yet he had somehow failed to perceive it until now.

The worm exuded an ominous, bone-chilling frost.

Most bizarre of all, at its front end its two pincers each held a long sword — one azure, one purple — crossed before its body in an odd pose, making it look like a peerless swordmaster among humans, possessing a certain aristocratic bearing.

“What the fuck is that?” Shentu's eyes nearly popped from their sockets as he swore aloud.

Everything he had seen today surpassed anything in his lifetime.

First there had been an encounter with a Void King Realm cultivator versed in Spatial Force — though Spatial Force was hard to cultivate, some in the Star Realm could succeed, but none as terrifying as that brat.

Now a powerful yao worm had appeared, and what Shentu found hardest to accept was that the creature knew how to use Secret Treasures — even a twin-sword form of Secret Treasure!

That Secret Treasure must be of Void King-Grade Upper-Level caliber, surely.

Shentu was utterly stunned.

While he gaped, the yao worm slowly rotated the two swords held in its pincers.

The purple and azure lights danced and the air seemed to grow even colder; the snowflakes in the sky swelled in size.

A flash of white light passed and an icy, profound intent spread.

In that instant the Yao Worm Matriarch vanished from Shentu's sight and reappeared not far behind him, still holding that strange pose as if it had never moved.
