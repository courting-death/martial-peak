## Chapter 452 — Who Gains the Most

Along the way, everyone Yang Kai encountered in the manor greeted him with strange expressions, especially the four girls from Wan Hua Palace. Each time they looked at him, there was a peculiar meaning in their eyes.

Lan Chudie was also giggling, her smile filled with ambiguous undertones.

Yang Kai’s expression was solemn, and he didn’t bother to explain anything; such things would only make matters worse.

“Young Master Kai, getting up this late? You sure woke up early today. Why not rest more in your bed?” Huo Xingchen suddenly appeared from somewhere, grinning mischievously and winking slyly. “How have things been these past few days?”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai asked, feigning ignorance.

“Heh, don’t pretend with me.” The eldest Young Master Huo stared at him as if seeing through his act and lowered his voice with a lecherous grin. “A single man and woman cohabiting for five whole days—surely something must have happened?”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Yang Kai shook his head, playing dumb.

“Forget it, I understand. But Young Master Kai, I really have to admire you. Though I’ve been with countless women, I’ve never gone five consecutive days without leaving the bed. In this area, you surpass me. We should discuss it properly someday.” Huo Xingchen’s face was filled with sincere laughter.

“I’m too lazy to deal with you!” Yang Kai pouted.

“What are you two whispering about?” Qiu Yimeng came over just then. After seeing Yang Kai, she snorted softly, displeased. “As one of the young masters participating in the succession war, I hope you keep the greater good in mind. The tender embraces and the hero’s grave... You understand that better than anyone.”

Yang Kai frowned. “Of course I know. No need to remind me.”

Qiu Yimeng opened her mouth to say more but thought better of it. She had already grasped Yang Kai’s temperament and knew better than to scold or argue with him again. A single reminder was enough—more might provoke him into losing his temper and turning hostile.

“Greetings, Young Master Kai!” A handsome and dashing young man standing beside Qiu Yimeng stepped forward to greet after their conversation, acting politely and respectfully.

“And who might this be...” Yang Kai eyed him suspiciously; this person seemed unfamiliar.

“The Second Young Master of Tianyuan City, Liu Feisheng. I mentioned him to you before.” Qiu Yimeng explained.

Liu Feisheng smiled gently and replied humbly, “We are deeply grateful, Young Master Kai, for your acceptance. The whole of Tianyuan City sends you gratitude.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. “Liu is your surname—what is your relation to the Liu Family?”

“I dare not presume such a connection.” Liu Feisheng smiled bitterly.

Qiu Yimeng said, “Whether or not there’s a connection, it exists to some degree. For centuries, the Eight Great Families have maintained ties with external powers. Young Master Liu’s family was originally a branch of the Liu Family, but was cast out a hundred years ago due to certain incidents. If you calculate carefully, Liu Qingyao should be his cousin.”

Liu Feisheng’s expression grew faintly sorrowful, humility deepened in his posture. “As someone exiled, I dare not speak of the Liu Family. For one hundred years, we have struggled to return. Although my father has become the city lord, acceptance has not yet come.”

Huo Xingchen smiled and said, “Just follow Young Master Kai. If you can help him win the succession war, I believe the Liu Family will welcome you back.”

Hearing this, a trace of excitement appeared on Liu Feisheng’s face. He cupped his fists respectfully. “Then I take your auspicious words, Young Master Huo. The people of Tianyuan City will unquestionably rally behind Young Master Kai!”

Yang Kai nodded faintly with little comment, then looked toward Qiu Yimeng. “Has my eighth brother been defeated?”

Qiu Yimeng looked at him surprised and chuckled softly. “You noticed so early?”

“Of course. Without the arrival of those from Yao Wang Valley, my eighth brother might have held out longer. But with their appearance, my brothers no doubt felt the crisis. If they didn’t win some victories by now, no one would dare side with them.”

“Indeed. As you say, Yang Quan has been eliminated.”

“When did it happen?”

“Two nights ago.” Qiu Yimeng went on to relay the full situation.

The arrival of over thirty alchemists from Yao Wang Valley had thrown the Yang Family scions into a panic. On one hand, they urgently needed a victory to boost their prestige; on the other, they sought ways to curb the aid Yao Wang Valley was giving to Yang Kai.

Two nights ago, Yang Zhao, Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying had turned their eyes on Yang Quan’s manor simultaneously.

Yang Quan’s manor only had one Blood Servant at the Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage guarding it, and aside from that, only an allied second-tier force by his maternal family.

A total disadvantage; defense was impossible.

After a fierce battle, Yang Zhao secured the command flag, while Yang Shen captured Yang Quan himself. Thus, the second Yang Family scion was eliminated from the succession war.

“That night’s battle is quite interesting,” Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly. “Rather than attacking Yang Quan, they were attacking each other. The manor’s defenses collapsed in the first wave. Except for the Blood Servant protecting Yang Quan, the others barely fought back and were almost routed.”

“Moreover, your four brothers divided into two camps fighting one another, suffering losses on both sides. Yang Zhao and Yang Kang are full brothers, as are Yang Shen and Yang Ying, making it a sharp clash.” She glanced meaningfully at Yang Kai. “But tell me, who do you think gained the most from this fight?”

Huo Xingchen smiled, seemingly waiting for Yang Kai’s reply, confident he couldn’t figure it out.

Yang Kai sneered coldly. “They gained a command flag and my eighth brother, but those gains roughly just balanced out the losses they suffered attacking each other. Their true gain was the reputation brought by this victory alone. If anyone gained the most, apart from me... who else could it be?”

The smiles on Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen’s faces faded, replaced by shocked and astonished looks. Clearly, they hadn’t expected Yang Kai to perceive the situation so deeply.

Liu Feisheng looked equally stunned; a strange fear bloomed within him. He realized he had still underestimated Yang Kai.

“You knew?” Qiu Yimeng hesitated, then asked, “How did you know?”

“You tell me.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Suddenly, Qiu Yimeng recalled a few days prior when everyone had discussed why Yang Kai hadn’t pressed his advantage to grow stronger. Yang Kai had said he didn’t want to be too conspicuous, but there was another reason he hadn’t shared, only telling them to wait and they’d understand later; otherwise, it would come across as arrogance.

So he had already foreseen it.

“If I didn’t know you’d been shut in your room for five days straight, I might have thought someone had told you all this in advance.” Qiu Yimeng drew in a deep breath and let out a bitter smile. “You really are a man one cannot guard against. That’s right — the greatest harvest is still yours. Even without claiming a command flag or a captive, and with no direct part in this affair, you still managed to gain a Blood Servant!”

“That Blood Servant from Yang Quan’s manor defected to you after Yang Quan’s defeat.” Qiu Yimeng’s voice lowered. “That Blood Servant’s strength is comparable to Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.”

“Injured, yes? Where is he?” Yang Kai hurriedly inquired.

Blood Servants were a supremely loyal group. With Yang Quan out, the Blood Servant at his side surely couldn’t escape unscathed. The fact that he hadn’t died outright attested to his strength.

“Severely wounded and recuperating. He won’t be combat-ready for another month or two. But with your miraculous skills, curing him should be no problem, right?” Qiu Yimeng snorted. She still didn’t understand what divine pills Yang Kai had given Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu for their overnight complete recovery.

Even more baffling was how Qu Gaoyi was gravely injured that night yet appeared vigorous the next day.

Such miraculous pills must be incredibly precious, yet how could Yang Kai use them so recklessly?

“I’ll go see him soon.” Yang Kai nodded softly.

“Can you tell me why?”

“Why what?”

“Why that Blood Servant chose to come to you instead of any other young master? Why you could predict ten days ago that after Yang Quan’s fall, that Blood Servant would seek you out? There must be a reason.”

The incident at the Blood Servants Hall was only known among the Yang Family’s upper echelons and the young masters; others remained ignorant. Qiu Yimeng naturally knew little.

Little did she know that Yang Kai had risked everything by using seriously weakened Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu, earning the respect of the entire Blood Servants Hall.

Having gained the respect of all the Blood Servant experts, when their previous young master was eliminated, where else could they turn but to Yang Kai?

“No comment.” Yang Kai grinned. “But I can tell you this: every Blood Servant that gets ousted from now on will come to my manor.”

His tone was confident, his expression wild.

Qiu Yimeng’s mind pictured powerful Blood Servants gathering at Yang Kai’s manor as the young masters fell one after another. She was astonished.

Such a thing had never happened before. No Yang Family scion had ever united all the Blood Servants under their banner.

If things truly unfold as Yang Kai predicted, he would be creating a miracle. With so many Blood Servants at his command, how could he be defeated? He would stand invincible, and his remaining enemies could only pray he wouldn’t attack them.

“I suddenly pity your brothers. This isn’t a fair fight at all,” Qiu Yimeng said bitterly.

“The succession war was never fair! If it were, how could Yang Tie and Yang Quan have been eliminated so early?” Yang Kai snorted coldly.
