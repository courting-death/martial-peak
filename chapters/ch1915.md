## Chapter 1915 — The Obstructive Fellows

Lost — utterly routed!

When that second Spiritual Pill bearing Pill Patterns appeared before his eyes, Zuo De knew he had not lost unjustly this time.

Yang Kai not only managed to form two pills at once, but one of them even bore Pill Patterns; such a talent was beyond Zuo De's reach even if he had tried his hardest.

Only now did the look of unwillingness on Zuo De's face gradually fade; he looked somewhat disheartened, drew a deep breath, placed the Spiritual Pill with Pill Patterns into the jade vial, cupped his hands to Yang Kai and said in a solemn voice, "Master Yang's skill is miraculous — Zuo De submits!"

Yang Kai looked at Zuo De with mild surprise; he had not expected him to say such words. Given his previous unwilling expression and his character, Yang Kai had assumed the old man would not concede easily, yet the outcome had turned out like this.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and said with a calm air, "Don't mention it."

Seeing Zuo De treat Yang Kai with such respect, the other alchemists did not stay aloof; they clasped their fists and said in turn, "Greetings, Master Yang. We were blind before; if we have offended, please forgive us."

Yang Kai smiled and replied, "Ignorance is no fault."

His magnanimous manner only won him more goodwill from those present.

Not to mention, Yang Kai himself was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, his personal martial might ranked among the best in the entire Star Domain, and paired with his status as a Void King-Grade alchemist, one could hardly argue if someone said he was the most valuable and honored person in the Star Domain.

What was rare was his broad-mindedness — he simply did not take the earlier rudeness to heart; this was the mark of a true master.

He was far better than Zuo De's reputation-seeking antics.

"Ling'er, apologize to the Master." After conceding, Zuo De seemed to change his whole demeanor; not only did he correct his own attitude, he even demanded his granddaughter offer an apology to Yang Kai.

Zuo Ling wore an unwilling expression and shyly hid behind Zuo De's back.

Just as Zuo De was about to scold her, Yang Kai smiled and waved it off: "Children don't know any better. Master, don't make things difficult for her. I didn't take it to heart."

A complex expression crossed Zuo De's eyes. He nodded and said, "Having met Master Yang today, Zuo De recognizes many of his own shortcomings. I am grateful for the lesson."

After a pause he turned to Chairman Ai Ou and said, "Chairman Ai Ou, I intend to seclude for a year or so. Once my seclusion is over, regarding the wager with Master Yang, I will fulfill my obligations yearly. I will take my leave now!"

As he spoke he returned the Spiritual Pill Yang had refined and, without waiting for Ai Ou's agreement, took Zuo Ling and left.

Ai Ou did not stop him, only saying, "Master, take care on your way."

He knew Zuo De no longer had the face to linger. That the old man could sincerely apologize to Yang Kai and correct his attitude was already rare; to stay longer would only be awkward. People like Zuo De, famous for years, still needed to keep face.

"Master, wait for me!" Zhan Yuan cried when he saw Zuo De leaving — he dared not remain. He shouted and hurried after them; previously he had opposed Yang Kai and sneered at him constantly, and now he was filled with bitter regret.

Had he known Yang Kai possessed such skill, he would never have been so blind; it would have been better to flatter him from the start.

Watching Zuo De's somewhat desolate, aging back, Yang Kai sighed softly.

Ai Ou, moved, stepped forward and asked, "Master Yang, why the sigh?"

After witnessing Yang Kai's pillmaking technique, his way of addressing Yang Kai immediately changed; "brother" was intimate, but "master" was a term of respect — it showed how greatly Yang Kai's status had risen in Ai Ou's heart.

To refine a Void King-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Pill that bore Pill Patterns — across the entire Star Domain there was no one else like him. Word also had it that he was on good terms with Xue Yue and had come to Shuiyue Star to visit her; Ai Ou was already considering how to keep Yang Kai in the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

That would be worth at least ten times what hosting a Guest Elder like Zuo De would bring.

"I am lamenting for Master Zuo," Yang Kai said lightly.

"Huh?" Ai Ou did not understand. "What do you mean by that?"

"Master Zuo's Pill Dao, I'm afraid it will make no further progress in the future," Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Ai Ou's face changed. He thought for a moment, then suddenly seemed to understand and asked, "Is it the previous Great Dao Pill Tone?"

"Yes. Master had earlier questioned that heavenly pill tone; fortunately he came to his senses in time, otherwise his entire alchemical art might not have been preserved — he could have been cast out from the Pill Dao and never refine again."

Ai Ou was struck with terror: "That Great Dao Pill Tone can have such an effect?"

Yang Kai smiled at him and said, "Chairman Ai Ou, were you to be rejected by the Martial Dao, your foundation would likewise be destroyed."

Ai Ou grew serious and said, "If one day the Martial Dao's heavenly tone resounds, I will seize the chance and study it thoroughly."

"The Martial Dao's heavenly tone... is too distant," Yang Kai said, shaking his head.

That the Great Dao Pill Tone had been triggered this time was something he had not expected. He had not imagined it would happen — his opponent was a Void King-Grade alchemist, and the pill being refined was a Void King-Grade Middle-Level Spiritual Pill — so Yang Kai had only aimed to give his all and had not thought much beyond that.

When he poured all he had gleaned from the True Alchemy Formula into the process, it unexpectedly provoked that heaven-and-earth phenomenon, unearthing the ultimate mysteries that lay dormant within the world.

Looking back now, Yang Kai found it somewhat incredible. If he were asked to do it again, he was certain he could not trigger the Great Dao Pill Tone.

"Chairman, are you free today?" an alchemist suddenly glared at Ai Ou.

The man was an Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemist, the same rank as Zhan Yuan. He usually treated Ai Ou with utmost respect, but today he adopted an accusatory stance and showed no fear of Ai Ou, leaving Ai Ou quite surprised.

"I'm fine," Ai Ou replied, unsure whether he had offended the man or why he was being asked.

"The Chairman handles the Guild's affairs day in and day out; how could you not be busy? Chairman, you should go up."

"Exactly — Chairman, the Commerce Guild has a mountain of matters waiting for you; what are you still doing here?"

"We see the Chairman off!" the alchemists chorused.

Ai Ou opened his mouth and looked at the several hundred alchemists before him, then suddenly understood and, surprised, laughed, "So that's what you meant... you should have said so earlier."

He shook his head again and again, laughing as he scolded, "Who would have thought someone of my stature would turn out to be unwelcome here!"

"Chairman, you're such a nag," one alchemist grumbled; they were still waiting to consult Master Yang on alchemical matters, and Ai Ou was monopolizing the Master's time. How infuriating! If they could have beaten him, they would have swarmed him and beaten him so badly his mother wouldn't even recognize him.

Ai Ou's expression turned stern. He snorted coldly, "Who was it who said they would leave our Hengluo Commerce Guild to seek employment elsewhere? Step forward and let me see!"

At his words many of the alchemists instinctively ducked their heads and slipped into the crowd, lest Ai Ou single them out.

Earlier they had spoken that way out of respect for Master Zuo; Ai Ou bringing up the matter now was clearly taking a private revenge in public.

Wherever Ai Ou's gaze swept, no one dared to meet his eyes.

Ai Ou's face instantly brimmed with pride, like a rooster that had just won a fight.

When had he ever been so overbearing before a crowd of alchemists without anyone daring to look him in the eye? Alchemists were temperamental; regardless of whether you were a Void King-Grade expert, if you interfered with their refining or impeded their study of alchemy, they would not tolerate it.

Thus Ai Ou often had to speak carefully around them.

Today he finally tasted the feeling of being on high ground.

He couldn't help but laugh out loud, ecstatic: "Not bad, not bad — looks like the Guild didn't raise you for nothing. You know how to relieve my worries; you're excellent."

"Chairman... Madam Gu, is she all right? Isn't she waiting for the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill..." someone in the crowd called out.

Before the voice finished, Ai Ou, as if injected with adrenaline, dashed off and in the blink of an eye was gone.

Damn — he had been carried away by pride and forgotten that Madam Gu was still in torment, unconscious. In that instant Ai Ou felt intense guilt.

"The obstructive fellows have finally left," a group of alchemists breathed a sigh of relief. The next moment they suddenly closed in around Yang Kai, bright eyes fixed on him as if they would devour him, fanatic to the extreme.

Yang Kai felt the hair on his scalp prickle. Before any of them spoke he raised a hand and said, "Friends, I know what you want. Hmm, I have some time now; why don't we find a place to talk properly? This spot won't do — so many peers are still meditating here."

The more than two hundred alchemists who had benefited from the Great Dao Pill Tone still sat with their eyes closed in meditation and had yet to awaken; they had clearly gained much.

Those who had not benefited naturally set their sights on Yang Kai. One word from the master was worth ten years of pillmaking; they would not miss such an opportunity.

They did not know how to broach the subject, but unexpectedly Yang Kai was so approachable that he offered himself up.

The alchemists were ecstatic and immediately recognized that Yang Kai and Zuo De were of entirely different types.

They had sought Master Zuo's guidance before, but his temper left much to be desired; he would either scold them or speak perfunctorily, often leaving people without any clear takeaway.

But from Yang Kai's bearing it was obvious he intended to lecture on the Pill Dao, and how could they not be delighted?

Someone proposed, "Let's go to the eighth floor — it's empty there now."

"Yes, yes, yes!"

"All right." Yang Kai nodded.

"Please, Master Yang!" the alchemists respectfully gestured with outstretched hands.

Yang Kai made no show of false modesty. In both the Martial Dao and the Pill Dao, attainment makes the master; though he was young and junior in rank to nearly everyone present, he was nevertheless far and away ahead in both martial and alchemical arts.

Excessive humility would be hypocritical.

So he naturally walked to the front and headed for the eighth floor.

A group of alchemists followed in orderly fashion.
