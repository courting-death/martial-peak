## Chapter 619 — Shui Ling's Persuasion

Thus, the Duao Alliance enjoyed considerable prestige among many martial artists who belonged to no sect or clan; many longed to join Duao Alliance to seek certain conveniences.

Precisely because of this, although Duao Alliance had a vast number of disciples, the true masters among them were few; compared with other forces, it always felt somewhat weak.

When Yun Xuan heard that Shui Ling was a disciple of the Water Divine Hall she reacted so gravely because she had such concerns—she did not dare lightly offend anyone from the Water Divine Hall.

However, now that the Scarlet Blood True Orchid had already been acquired by their group and the mission could be completed smoothly, whether Shui Ling was actually a disciple of the Water Divine Hall no longer mattered.

Two days later, the party left the marshlands.

Another day later, a vast city rising on the wilderness came into Yang Kai’s view. That was Duao City, the headquarters of Duao Alliance.

Those three days of travel allowed Yang Kai to truly taste the richness of Spiritual Qi on the Tongxuan Continent, and from the conversations of these people he also learned of the land’s fertility; here were many things that one in his original world would not dare imagine, and many renowned masters and experts.

Yang Kai’s horizons instantly widened, and with that his state of mind seemed to undergo some subtle changes.

At the gate of Duao City stood several guards who were inspecting passersby; they only watched warily and had no intention of blocking anyone.

Under Yun Xuan’s lead, the group easily entered the city.

The bustle struck them at once; countless martial artists passed by like a river of fish, unceasing and endless.

Yun Xuan smiled and explained, “Because our Duao Alliance mainly trades in materials for cultivation, the headquarters here is very lively. Many come to purchase alchemical and forging ingredients they need. On the continent, aside from the Merchants’ Alliance headquarters mall, our Duao City has the freest flow of goods. Of course, the Merchants’ Alliance runs trade with three sides—hehe—that’s something we cannot match.”

“Three-sided trade?” Yang Kai asked, suspicious.

“Yes. The Merchants’ Alliance’s mall sits in the Neutral Territory; their business deals with demons, yao, and humans alike. You didn’t know?” Yun Xuan’s bright eyes flickered; she looked at Yang Kai with some puzzlement.

“I don’t travel much, so I’m not very clear about outside affairs,” Yang Kai replied casually, composed in manner.

Yun Xuan uttered an “oh” and did not press further, lest she upset Yang Kai. From their three days together she had seen that he was relatively taciturn, and displayed keen curiosity and interest in things commonplace to them—clear signs of limited worldly experience.

Yet his mind was weighty and his disposition deep; he rarely asked about things he did not understand, choosing instead to observe with his eyes. This left Yun Xuan unable to read him—was this youth a raw novice just out into the world, or a worldly veteran?

In short, Yun Xuan inexplicably felt a certain pressure when facing him.

“If it is convenient, please come sit at our squad’s residence. We bought a house in the city; its surroundings are not bad,” Yun Xuan invited.

“All right.” Shui Ling agreed at once; she was eager to find somewhere to clean herself—travel had left her dusty and soiled.

“Ji Hong, take them there,” Yun Xuan instructed.

The bearded big man nodded and said, “Leave it to me.”

“Please go on ahead. We still need to report to the alliance and hand over the task; once that is done we will return.”

Yang Kai nodded and, with Shui Ling, followed the bearded man as they walked into the city in a certain direction.

Before long they arrived at a residence; Ji Hong enthusiastically led them inside, called servants to prepare bathing water, and arranged lodging and baths for Yang Kai and Shui Ling with the utmost hospitality.

The house’s surroundings were decent enough; although situated in the busy quarter, it was protected by a barrier so little noise could be heard.

Yang Kai accepted things as they were and felt no discomfort.

By dinner time a servant came to summon them, saying the evening meal had been prepared.

Yang Kai stepped outside and found Shui Ling had already recovered her usual look and was waiting for him.

The two exchanged smiles and went out together.

At the banquet Yun Xuan’s squad proved exceedingly hospitable, coming round to toast; Shui Ling declined alcohol, while Yang Kai accepted without refusal, sampling the wines and dishes of this foreign land with evident enjoyment.

Yun Xuan even handed over the one hundred and fifty-two Crystal Stones previously agreed upon to Yang Kai, smiling, “Save it and use it sparingly. Don’t go spending it on revelry. There are too many temptations in Duao City you cannot resist, especially for a callow youth like you, giggle…”

As she spoke her eyes shone; likely from drinking, her tone grew more uninhibited, her cheeks flushed and breath sweet—she looked most alluring.

Seeing Yun Xuan in that state, the bearded men all abandoned Yang Kai and, with unmentionable intentions, attempted to ply Yun Xuan with drink.

Yun Xuan did not refuse the advances, and Yang Kai watched in astonishment.

The revelry lasted most of the night; Yang Kai and Shui Ling left one after the other, while the members of Duao Alliance persisted—only Ji Hong alone remained upright in the end, the others having been cleanly overturned by Yun Xuan.

Back in the room, Yang Kai took the Crystal Stones out from the Black Book Space and examined them, his expression brightening.

He discovered that these Crystal Stones contained extremely pure and vast energy—energy that any martial artist could absorb to replenish their True Yuan.

Although he had quietly asked Shui Ling about the Crystal Stone’s secrets before, it was only now in hand that Yang Kai realized their preciousness.

If such things existed, martial artists in his former world could also rapidly advance in cultivation—unfortunately, they did not have such conveniences.

On the Tongxuan Continent Crystal Stones were hard currency; they could be used for cultivation, to refine pills and forge instruments, and were the standard by which goods were valued.

Yang Kai clicked his tongue in amazement; he had never expected such things to exist in the world.

Since coming to the Tongxuan Continent he had stepped into another realm—everything felt so strange and so novel.

A knock came from outside. Yang Kai slightly opened his Divine Sense to confirm the visitor’s identity, waved, and the door opened; Shui Ling stepped in under the moonlight.

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked.

“Nothing, I couldn’t sleep. I came to chat,” Shui Ling said as she seated herself and poured a cup of tea.

“I saw you went out earlier today. Was that to report your safety to home?”

“You noticed?” Shui Ling looked at him in surprise.

Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Yes. I went to inform them. The Duao Alliance has our Water Divine Hall’s contact point there; I spoke with them after being missing for more than two years. In about half a month they’ll likely send someone to bring me home.”

“What is your status in the Water Divine Hall? You seem to hold a high position.”

“Heh, my father is the hall master of the Water Divine Hall.”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “So you are the Water Divine Hall’s little princess.”

Shui Ling curled her lips. “Little princess, my foot. When I was at your place I let you bully me however you liked!”

Yang Kai chuckled, “You’re not thinking of revenge now, are you?”

“I’m not that bored,” Shui Ling scoffed. She was grateful to Yang Kai for bringing her back; she would not be seeking revenge.

“But actually, I do have a request. I hope you’ll hear me out,” Shui Ling’s expression suddenly turned serious.

“Oh?”

“Would you join our Water Divine Hall?” Shui Ling went straight to the point.

Yang Kai looked at her oddly and frowned, “Why would you want me to join?”

“Because I’ve seen many wonders in you. I believe with your ability you will achieve much on the Tongxuan Continent, so I hope you’ll join the Water Divine Hall. If you agree I can provide the best training conditions to help you quickly raise your strength. Also, your main purpose here was to find those few friends of yours, right? With the Water Divine Hall’s help that would be much easier.”

“Generous terms,” Yang Kai said with a wry smile.

“You’re worth my offering such terms, and I have the means to fulfill them.”

“I believe you.” Yang Kai nodded; as the Water Divine Hall’s little princess, Shui Ling indeed had such authority.

“So will you agree or not?” Shui Ling watched him expectantly.

Yang Kai shook his head and became earnest, “I appreciate that you think highly of me, but having lived in Zhongdu so long you should know my character.”

“Of course I know. I won’t restrict you. If you merely join the Water Divine Hall that is enough; the rest is up to you.”

“Joining the Water Divine Hall is the greatest restriction.” Yang Kai smiled.

“I knew it…” Shui Ling sighed softly. Though she suspected her proposal would likely fail, she could not resist trying to persuade him, hoping that perhaps, after drinking tonight, he might impulsively say yes.

But now it seemed he was clearer-headed than ever.

“Enough, I won’t force you. But if one day you decide to come to the Water Divine Hall, be sure to tell me.”

Yang Kai gave no response.

The night passed without further talk. The next day Yun Xuan came over and offered to take Yang Kai and Shui Ling to see the sights of Duao City.

Yang Kai, curious to learn of this foreign land’s customs, naturally did not refuse.

Seeing her seem perfectly fine, Yang Kai marveled anew at Yun Xuan’s prodigious drinking capacity.

According to the household, the several large men in Yun Xuan’s squad had all been overturned last night; Yun Xuan alone had drunk several jars before stopping.

Such a capacity left Yang Kai astonished and caused him to regard her with a measure of respect.

Duao City was not small; though its area did not match Zhongdu’s, compared with cities from the other world it was vast.

In the sky flew strange Demonic Beasts, each with martial artists on their backs. Besides using Demonic Beasts as mounts, there were also Secret Treasures specifically for carrying people through the air; varied in design, each was adorned splendidly and paraded ostentatiously over the city.

Yun Xuan said that those who dared fly above Duao City must possess certain identity and status; small fry like them could only walk obediently below.
