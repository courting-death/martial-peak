## Chapter 35 — The First Drop of Yang Liquid

Yang Kai did not know how much Primordial Qi others possessed at the seventh stage of Body Tempering, but it certainly could not compare to his own. The initial accumulation was always painstakingly slow. It was only because he had the True Yang Technique that he could absorb the Yang energy from Heaven and Earth. Yet, how many such wondrous techniques like the True Yang Technique existed in the world?

One day, after finishing his cultivation, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes.

The Yang energy he had been absorbing over these days had gradually grown denser, and the warmth coursing through his meridians intensified. Yang Kai vaguely sensed that the Yang energy he had absorbed was nearing saturation.

Once the Yang energy in the body reached saturation, it would condense and transform into liquid Qi, forming a drop of Yang Liquid stored within the Dantian. This so-called Yang Liquid was of immeasurable use; it could be employed in battle to unleash unexpected effects. Yang Kai was quite eager to see its power.

As he slowly opened his eyes and prepared to rest briefly, his peripheral vision suddenly caught sight of a figure standing not far beside him. Yang Kai’s expression shifted; immersed in cultivation, he had not noticed when this person had arrived.

The man stood sideways to Yang Kai, dressed in a flowing azure robe, sleeves fluttering gently. His posture was upright. Though his hair and beard were white, his brows and eyes shone with clarity. A delicate goatee adorned his chin. Judging by his age, he was roughly the same as Elder Meng of the Contribution Hall, but his aura was entirely different.

At first glance, the phrase “immortal bearing and Daoist spirit” involuntarily sprang to Yang Kai’s mind. This aura sharply contrasted with Elder Meng’s roguish, lustful, and disorderly demeanor. Between the two, one was heavenly, the other earthly.

At this moment, the man had one hand behind his back, the other stroking his beard, gazing down upon the Dragon Confinement Ravine before him. His eyes were strange, tinged with a complex mixture of emotions.

This was a learned sage, a venerable elder of great martial prowess! Yang Kai’s heart stirred with calculation. He quickly rose and performed a disciple’s salute: “Disciple Yang Kai pays respects to the honored elder.”

Startled by Yang Kai’s voice, the elder slowly turned, looking at him kindly and nodding slightly. “Mm.”

“May I ask how I should address you?” Although Yang Kai knew this person was undoubtedly a high-ranking member of Lingxiao Pavilion, he had never seen him before and naturally wished to clarify to avoid confusion in seniority.

The elder pondered, furrowing his brows as if Yang Kai’s question was a difficult one. After a long moment, he said, “You may call me Elder Eleven.”

Elder Eleven? Yang Kai was somewhat puzzled. Although Lingxiao Pavilion had several elders, there could not possibly be as many as eleven. Yet, since this man was an elder, Yang Kai could only comply and saluted again: “Disciple pays respects to Elder Eleven.”

Elder Eleven stroked his beard and smiled, his expression growing even gentler. In a soft voice, he asked, “Are you cultivating martial techniques?”

“Yes,” Yang Kai nodded.

“And they are Yang attribute techniques?”

“Yes.” The elder’s strength was certainly formidable; there was no way he could not sense the Yang energy Yang Kai was absorbing here.

“How is your cultivation progressing?”

“Only a few days in, so far so good.”

Elder Eleven asked several more questions, and Yang Kai answered each carefully. He felt somewhat moved; this elder was kind and considerate, showing such care even to a lowly disciple like himself, which naturally inspired goodwill.

Seeing the elder so approachable, Yang Kai recalled a question and spoke: “Elder Eleven, I have been cultivating here for many days, but there is one thing I do not understand.”

“Oh? Please, do tell.” Elder Eleven’s interest was piqued.

“Why does Yang energy overflow from beneath the Dragon Confinement Ravine?”

Elder Eleven chuckled softly. “That is naturally because there is a Yang attribute treasure buried below.”

Yang Kai could only laugh wryly to himself. Of course he could guess that, but what exactly lay beneath remained a mystery.

“Do you know how the Dragon Confinement Ravine was formed?” Elder Eleven suddenly asked an unrelated question.

Though unsure of his intent, Yang Kai shook his head honestly.

Elder Eleven glanced at the ravine and spoke slowly, “It was split open by a sword.”

Yang Kai’s mind trembled violently! The Dragon Confinement Ravine, hundreds of zhang wide, of unknown length and unfathomable depth, was actually cleaved by a single sword? Had anyone else told him this, Yang Kai would have doubted it, but this Elder Eleven had no reason to deceive him.

Yet, who was this person whose sword’s might could create such a chasm? And what realm had they attained?

“Several hundred years ago, Lingxiao Pavilion did not exist here,” Elder Eleven’s gaze grew deep, his voice low.

Yang Kai knew the elder was about to reveal some unknown secret and focused intently.

“At that time, the Patriarch passed through here and encountered a powerful demon. The two fought fiercely in this very place. No one knows the details of the battle, but in the end, the demon realized defeat and unleashed a sword strike.” As he spoke, Elder Eleven traced a line across the east and west ends of the ravine. “With that single sword, the Dragon Confinement Ravine was formed! The demon fled into the ravine’s depths, and the Patriarch pursued, enduring great hardship before finally slaying the demon.”

“Though the demon was powerful, and its body and soul destroyed, the Patriarch was not at ease. Thus, he founded Lingxiao Pavilion here and guarded this place for decades. Only after confirming no further threats did he depart. This is the origin of Lingxiao Pavilion.”

“The Dragon Confinement Ravine has existed for centuries. Its depths are pitch black and sunless. Later, many disciples with crimes were exiled here. It is not impossible that some Yang attribute treasure emerged here by chance. That is why you can absorb Yang energy here.”

Yang Kai nodded but asked, “Elder Eleven, did you come here to seek that treasure?”

“Me?” Elder Eleven’s expression was strange as he slowly shook his head. “I did not come for the treasure. I came to observe the people.”

“Observe the people?”

Elder Eleven smiled faintly. “Old age brings many words. That will be all for today. You should cultivate diligently, but do not foolishly attempt to venture deep below. The dangers there are great; even I dare not go lightly.”

With that, Elder Eleven departed gracefully. Yang Kai’s heart was stirred and filled with many questions, but he could only keep them to himself.

After calming his mind somewhat, Yang Kai resumed circulating the True Yang Technique. Now that the True Yang Technique was fully engaged, the speed at which he absorbed Yang energy was many times faster than before.

Several hours later, Yang Kai suddenly felt his meridians swelling unbearably, even his Dantian felt full to bursting, as if he had overeaten.

Was it nearly saturated? Yang Kai was not alarmed but delighted, focusing all his attention.

Half an hour later, the swelling in his meridians and Dantian suddenly vanished. In that instant, all the Primordial Qi in his meridians surged into his Dantian. A drop of scorching liquid quietly took shape, dripping into the Dantian. Yang Kai even heard a faint “tick” sound.

Yang Liquid! He had finally formed his first drop of Yang Liquid!
