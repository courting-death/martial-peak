## Chapter 2208 — The Melting Cave

Half a day later, Yang Kai returned to Feiyan Peak from Wen Zishan.

During this half day, Wen Zishan explained the mysteries of the Divine Roaming Mirror to Yang Kai in detail. The more Yang Kai learned about it, the more astonished he was that such a wondrous treasure could exist and that such a mysterious space could be found.

Wen Zishan was right. As long as one could enter the Divine Roaming Mirror and come out alive, the improvement for any cultivator would be immense. This improvement was not just in pure strength, but in one’s very foundation and overall abilities. It was of extraordinary significance to any cultivator.

Only now did he finally understand why, a few days ago, Gao Xueting had suddenly come to find him and, before leaving, had given him a Ziyang Profound Light Barrier. She had either foreseen this matter or was simply being cautious, so she had deliberately given him a Secret Treasure for soul defense, just to provide Yang Kai with an extra layer of safety after entering the Divine Roaming Mirror.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat. After pondering for a while, he showed a bitter smile and muttered softly, “Ginger only gets spicier with age!”

The reason he said this was because he had figured out that his entry into the Divine Roaming Mirror had probably been decided by Wen Zishan and the others more than ten days ago.

Yet today, this Hall Master Wen had pretended to make things difficult, and in his words had repeatedly hinted that the rewards Xia Sheng and the others received were different from Yang Kai’s, all to lure Yang Kai into using up his previous promise.

In other words, even if Yang Kai did not use the promise Wen Zishan had made to him, he should still have been able to enter the Divine Roaming Mirror.

At this point, regret was useless. Yang Kai felt that he should actually thank Wen Zishan. Wen Zishan had opened up the great secret of Qingyang Shrine to an outsider like him, giving him the chance to enter the Divine Roaming Mirror. So what if that promise was used up?

The next day he would enter the Divine Roaming Mirror. So after returning to Feiyan Peak, Yang Kai was in no rush to further refine the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier, since with only half a day left, no amount of refining would make much difference.

He simply sat cross-legged in meditation, adjusting his state to its peak.

The next morning, at dawn, Yang Kai opened his eyes. Divine light flashed in his gaze, clearly showing he had rested well.

Immediately, he set out in a certain direction deep within the Qingyang Mountain Range.

About half an hour later, at the foot of a tall peak, Yang Kai landed.

On the open ground ahead, four figures were already standing. With a glance, Yang Kai saw that they were none other than Xia Sheng, Xiao Baiyi, Murong Xiaoxiao, and Shen Muji.

“Ha! I knew Brother Yang would definitely come.” Xia Sheng laughed loudly as soon as he saw Yang Kai.

Xiao Baiyi, on the other hand, looked shocked, because he thought the Divine Roaming Mirror was a sect secret, and that an outsider like Yang Kai, no matter how great his contributions, would never have a chance to enter. He never expected his own Hall Master to be so generous.

“Junior Brother Yang!” Murong Xiaoxiao smiled at Yang Kai and nodded in greeting.

“Brother Yang!” Shen Muji also cupped his fists slightly. Although he and Yang Kai were not yet familiar, at least they had exchanged a few words. Besides, since everyone was about to enter the Divine Roaming Mirror together, they would have to support each other, so it was only natural to build some rapport in advance.

Yang Kai also cupped his fists in return, greeted everyone, and after a few words of small talk, changed the subject. “Is it just us entering this time? Isn’t there an elder leading the team?”

Xia Sheng smiled, “Of course there is. It’s said the Divine Roaming Mirror is quite dangerous inside, and the Shrine wouldn’t feel at ease letting just us Dao Origin Realm cultivators enter alone. They should send an Emperor Realm elder to assist.”

“We just don’t know who it will be,” Shen Muji said with a smile.

Xia Sheng’s face darkened, and he muttered, “Just don’t let it be Elder Gao…”

Last time they went to the Four Seasons Land, he had been left behind on the flying ship by Gao Xueting both coming and going, so he was quite afraid of her.

After speaking, Xia Sheng turned suspiciously to look at Murong Xiaoxiao, his face full of confusion. “Xiaoxiao, did you not sleep well last night? Why do your eyelids keep twitching?”

“It’s not that…” Murong Xiaoxiao replied softly, her face anxious.

“Hmph!” Xiao Baiyi snorted coldly and turned his gaze elsewhere, while Shen Muji looked up at the sky and Yang Kai lowered his head to study the ground…

Suddenly, Xia Sheng seemed to understand something, and couldn’t help but shiver all over.

From behind, a chill swept over him, as if a peerless demon god was standing there. A towering figure blocked out the sky, making Xia Sheng feel as if he had fallen into an ice cellar.

“Haha…” He forced a dry laugh. “What was I just saying…?”

Before he could finish speaking, a sharp pain suddenly struck the top of his head, as if someone had ruthlessly knocked him. The next instant, he sprawled flat on the ground in the shape of a cross, not moving an inch…

“All of you, follow me!” Gao Xueting said coolly, turning and flying upward.

“Yes!” The group responded and followed closely behind Gao Xueting.

As she was leaving, Murong Xiaoxiao gave Xia Sheng a sympathetic look, but didn’t have the courage to help him up. She could only silently pray for her Senior Brother in her heart.

Along the way, Gao Xueting didn’t say a word, making the disciples feel immense pressure. For some reason, whenever they were with her, everyone unconsciously became serious, as if her icy aura intimidated them.

Before long, they reached the top of the peak.

At the summit, there was a sheer cliff facing a deep abyss, smooth and flat.

Gao Xueting hovered in midair in front of the cliff.

Yang Kai and the others stood about three zhang away from Gao Xueting, all curiously observing the place.

It was understandable for Yang Kai to be curious, since he wasn’t a disciple of Qingyang Shrine and was unfamiliar with everything here. But Xiao Baiyi and the others were different. They had lived and studied at Qingyang Shrine for many years and had passed by this place many times, always thinking it was just an ordinary mountain. They never imagined such a great secret was hidden here.

“Once inside, don’t look at what you shouldn’t, don’t say what you shouldn’t…” Gao Xueting suddenly warned sternly. “Especially you!”

As she finished, her authoritative gaze landed on Xia Sheng, who was hiding behind Murong Xiaoxiao.

No one knew when he had caught up…

“I’ll become mute right now!” Xia Sheng immediately made a gesture as if sewing his mouth shut with invisible thread.

Only then did Gao Xueting turn to face the smooth cliff wall and call out sweetly, “Granny You, are you there? By order of the Sect Master, Xueting has brought several disciples to enter the Divine Roaming Mirror. May I trouble Granny to open the barrier?”

Her tone was extremely polite. Even when facing Wen Zishan or Qiu Ran, she had never been so courteous.

As for Wen Zishan, that was one thing—Gao Xueting seemed to have been raised by him, and they were very close. Wen Zishan often did things that angered her, so naturally he didn’t get her respect. But Qiu Ran, as Deputy Hall Master of Qingyang Shrine and a Second Stage Emperor Realm, had never received such polite treatment from her.

Moreover… Yang Kai faintly sensed that, besides politeness, there was also a trace of caution and nervousness in Gao Xueting’s demeanor.

Coupled with the way she addressed herself, as if she were a junior, Yang Kai immediately guessed that this Granny You guarding the forbidden area must be an ancient figure with a terrible temper!

This guess surprised Yang Kai a little, as he hadn’t expected such a person to exist in Qingyang Shrine.

After Gao Xueting called out, she waited quietly.

Only after half a stick of incense did a flash of light suddenly appear on the cliff. Then, where there had been nothing, a cave appeared.

Seeing this, Gao Xueting whispered to the group, “Follow me!”

With that, she darted into the cave, and the others followed closely behind.

As soon as they entered the cave, a chilling aura immediately enveloped the group. Even though the weakest among them were at the Dao Origin Realm, everyone involuntarily shivered, goosebumps rising all over their bodies.

The cave was quiet and dimly lit. Gao Xueting led the way in front, with the others following behind, stumbling along.

No one spoke. Even their breathing was suppressed to the limit, and only faint heartbeats could be heard, adding to the eerie atmosphere.

The path inside the cave twisted and turned endlessly. Gao Xueting led them ever deeper into the mountain.

After a long while, a point of light suddenly appeared ahead.

Soon, they arrived at a vast, spacious cavern.

Looking around, the cavern was clean and bare, with little inside. In the very center stood something about the size of a tabletop, flashing with light, looking just like a mirror.

Everyone’s expression changed as they immediately realized this was the legendary Divine Roaming Mirror. All eyes turned to it, trying to get a clear look.

But as soon as they looked, they found the Divine Roaming Mirror was incredibly mysterious. The originally smooth surface instantly transformed into a huge vortex, emitting unimaginable suction. Immediately, everyone’s Sea of Consciousness churned, their souls restless, as if even their spirits were about to be sucked away.

Startled, they quickly averted their gaze. No one dared look at that strange object again, and everyone broke out in a cold sweat.

“Young people only know how small they are after suffering a loss, hmph!”

Suddenly, a harsh voice echoed through the spacious cavern, making everyone feel as if their skin was being scratched by a hundred claws, completely ill at ease.

To describe it, the voice was like two pieces of iron being ground together… After hearing it, Yang Kai and the others felt their scalps tingle.

As the voice sounded, a figure bizarrely appeared before them.

No one noticed when she had appeared. Even Gao Xueting, at the moment this person showed up, had her Origin Qi surge instinctively, though she quickly suppressed it.
