## Chapter 2543 — Joining Forces Against the Enemy

“There are exactly twelve people here, and the cave entrance isn’t very wide—about enough for four to stand side by side. What I mean is, we can split into three groups, each taking turns to block the entrance and hold off these ghost creatures. Every group defends for the time it takes an incense stick to burn, then the next group swaps in!”

“This way, each round gives everyone about half an hour to rest, enough to recover most of your strength, so no one will be completely exhausted.”

“As for these ghost creatures, kill them if you can, block them if you can’t. The windstorm will pass eventually. As soon as it stops, we can leave this place without getting tangled up with them, and maybe we’ll have a chance to survive.”

“But if we want to cooperate like this, everyone must give their all and trust each other. No one can harbor hidden motives.”

“That’s my proposal. What do you all think?”

After Qi Hefeng finished speaking, he turned to look around at everyone.

The four who were already holding off the ghost creatures at the entrance had no objections, since they’d already taken the first shift and were eager to rest. They cheered loudly, nodding repeatedly, wishing they could step back right now.

The others didn’t show much expression, but anyone thinking straight knew Qi Hefeng was right. In a crisis like this, survival depended on working together—there was no way to escape otherwise.

So after a brief silence, someone nodded and said, “Brother Qi is right. I agree!”

“Agreed!”

“Agreed!”

With the situation as it was, no one disagreed, so soon most people in the cave reached a consensus.

Qi Hefeng turned to Yang Kai, as if seeking his opinion. Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, “Let’s do it.”

Qi Hefeng’s expression grew serious. “Since no one objects, let’s begin. But let me be clear: this cooperation can’t afford any mistakes. If anyone slacks off or tries anything underhanded, don’t blame us for turning on you.”

“Of course!”

Soon, under Qi Hefeng’s direction, the remaining eight were split into two groups.

He clearly saw that Yang Kai, Zhang Ruoxi, and Old Ban were together, so he didn’t separate them. Instead, he had another Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator join their group, making up the third rotation.

With the teams set, Qi Hefeng took the lead, charging out with three others.

The four who’d been at the entrance retreated, clearing the way.

Soon, Qi Hefeng’s group clashed with the ghost creatures in a fierce battle, while the original four withdrew to the back, each taking out Spiritual Pills and sitting down to recover.

They didn’t have much time—only about half an hour—so they had to make the most of it.

With the change of defenders, the previously shaky line suddenly became solid as iron. Qi Hefeng’s group was strong, and with the brilliance of their Secret Treasures, the Yin-Soul ghosts were forced back, many being destroyed.

Seeing this, everyone’s spirits lifted, feeling more and more that Qi Hefeng’s plan was right.

If they could survive this ordeal, Qi Hefeng would be the greatest hero. If he hadn’t stepped up to organize everyone, the twelve here would’ve remained a scattered mess.

Qi Hefeng’s group held the line for an incense stick’s time. Though they spent a lot of energy, they made it through safely.

As the time approached, Yang Kai slowly stood and said softly, “Old Ban, stay a bit behind me and just handle any that slip through.”

Old Ban nodded gently, saying nothing more.

He was the weakest here, only at the First Stage Dao Origin Realm, and old to boot. Forget the Ghost Generals—even a dozen or twenty ordinary Yin-Souls would be enough to finish him off.

He knew Yang Kai’s cultivation was extraordinary, not even afraid of the Ghost King, let alone the King’s underlings. Yang Kai was protecting him, so there was no reason to refuse.

As Yang Kai moved, he led Zhang Ruoxi, Old Ban, and the other Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator to take over, replacing Qi Hefeng’s group.

As soon as Zhang Ruoxi acted, she shone brilliantly. Her Divine Sense burst forth, forming invisible blades that swept the field like divine weapons, cutting down the Yin-Soul ghosts at the entrance like stalks of grain.

The Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator who joined Yang Kai’s group turned in astonishment to look at Zhang Ruoxi, finally realizing that this stunningly beautiful girl possessed such power. He felt both awe and respect.

Perhaps out of male pride, he gritted his teeth and desperately unleashed his own Divine Soul power, not wanting to be looked down on.

Yang Kai’s performance wasn’t as flashy as Zhang Ruoxi’s, but every time his Divine Soul power erupted, he silently wiped out a large swath of Yin-Souls. Most of them hid in the strange mist nearby, so even if he made a big commotion, the others couldn’t see it.

Occasionally, he’d deliberately let one or two ordinary Yin-Souls slip by for Old Ban to handle.

It wasn’t to spare Old Ban’s pride—everyone else was working hard to resist the Yin-Souls, so if Old Ban did nothing, it wouldn’t sit right.

One or two ordinary Yin-Souls were easy for Old Ban to deal with—he wouldn’t be idle, nor would he be in danger.

As soon as Yang Kai’s group took over the defense, the situation changed dramatically.

Before, no matter who stood at the entrance, they saw endless ghost creatures—no matter how many they killed, more kept coming, driving everyone to despair.

But now, with Zhang Ruoxi slaughtering openly and Yang Kai secretly cutting off the Yin-Souls’ reinforcements, in just ten breaths, the entrance cleared up considerably.

The number of ghost creatures dropped noticeably, giving everyone the illusion that the disaster was passing.

Seeing this, the eight resting in the back couldn’t help but perk up, as if seeing a ray of hope in the gloom, their faces lighting up.

After another incense stick’s time, the first group of four came over on their own to take over.

By now, no one was thinking only of their own survival—everyone knew that working together was the only way out.

But after they took over, it didn’t take long to notice that the ghost creatures, which had nearly been wiped out, were suddenly increasing again, leaving them frustrated.

And so, round after round, the twelve in the cave rotated methodically, constantly fending off the ghost creatures’ attacks.

After a day, everyone’s expressions grew more serious.

Because after a whole day, the ghost creatures still showed no sign of retreating, endlessly charging at the cave.

In this day-long struggle, most people had suffered some injuries—not fatal, but troublesome if not treated promptly.

Only Yang Kai’s group of four remained unscathed, thanks to Yang Kai’s secret protection.

The injuries were troublesome, but what truly wore everyone down was the relentless strain on their Divine Soul. No matter who it was, after channeling their soul power for so long—even with half an hour’s rest each round and the aid of Spiritual Pills—the exhaustion clung to them, impossible to shake off.

Worse, the Spiritual Pills for restoring Divine Soul power were almost used up.

If their Spiritual Pills really ran out with no other way to restore their Divine Soul power, and the windstorm still didn’t let up, then there was only one fate waiting for everyone—death.

A sense of unease spread through the cave. Qi Hefeng even took out his extra Divine Soul Spiritual Pills to share, but it was a drop in the bucket—barely helped at all.

Another half day passed, and things got even worse.

People’s moods grew unstable, with constant shouting and cursing as they vented their frustration.

Qi Hefeng’s brow furrowed tightly, but he had no way to change the situation.

All he could do was look to Yang Kai, his eyes full of pleading.

Yang Kai glanced at him, snorted softly, and though he was a bit annoyed, he couldn’t stay out of it any longer.

After telling Old Ban and Zhang Ruoxi not to follow, he slowly stood and walked toward the cave entrance.

The others watched curiously, not knowing what he was up to.

At the entrance, Yang Kai took a deep breath, flicked his wrist, and the Myriad Sword appeared, its aura surging like the sea and spreading out instantly.

Hummm…

The whole cave seemed to tremble.

“What’s that…?”

“Emperor Realm!”

“There’s actually an Emperor Realm master here?”

Everyone stared in shock at Yang Kai standing at the entrance. His heroic figure seemed to grow taller in an instant. Even the four struggling at the entrance turned to look at him, dazed.

Yang Kai had performed well before, but hadn’t shown his full strength, and with everyone fighting for their lives, no one paid much attention.

Only now did they realize Yang Kai was actually an Emperor Realm master!

No wonder the three with him were unharmed, no wonder every time he took a turn, the ghost creatures thinned out so much. People had wondered before, but hadn’t thought much of it—now it all made sense.

“Haha, we’re saved! We’re really saved!”

“Damn, I thought I’d die here, but looks like the King of Hell isn’t taking me yet.”

“Master, please show these bastards what you can do!”

Faced with this sudden hope, everyone erupted in cheers, their excitement overflowing. It was as if, with Yang Kai finally stepping forward, all the ghost creatures blocking their path would be swept away in an instant.
