## Chapter 609 — Going to Tianlang

As the days passed, the relative strengths of the three colors within the Heavenly Journey Palace changed in a way that was plainly visible each day.

The pitch-black demonic aura grew ever more potent, while the fiery red and pearly white lights gradually waned.

Nearly a month later, with a single explosion, the black hue flooded the entire Heavenly Journey Palace, and the fire-red and pearly white were extinguished in an instant.

Immediately, those pitch-black demonic energies surged toward a single source, as if a whirlpool had opened up there and swallowed them whole.

Slowly, Yang Kai's figure came into view for all to see; the destructive aura that had oppressed the skies over Zhongdu for a month at last dispersed.

Whoosh...

The Heavenly Journey Palace that had enveloped and sustained Yang Kai's residence expended its remaining energy at that moment and shattered apart.

The exact grade of the Heavenly Journey Palace was unknown, but ever since Meng Wuya left it had been able to protect Yang Kai's residence; no one had poured energy into it and yet it had sustained itself until now, a testament to its power.

The small palace drifted down from the sky; Yang Kai reached out and summoned it into his palm.

It was Meng Wuya's Secret Treasure. Yang Kai tried to sense it but found he could not communicate with it at all, so he gave up and placed it into the Black Book Space.

Standing quietly where he was and feeling the changes within and without, a faint smile tugged at Yang Kai's lips.

Everyone at the residence stepped forward one after another, their faces alight with joy as they looked at Yang Kai.

Huo Xingchen laughed heartily, "Young Master Kai, it seems you've gained much."

Yang Kai nodded lightly. "A little."

The thirteen Blood Servants, however, wore puzzled expressions, for they had noticed Yang Kai spent a month absorbing the True Spirit's power; although he had succeeded, his cultivation showed no change—he remained at the Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage.

This discovery left them somewhat baffled.

If his cultivation had not changed, where had the True Spirit's power that Yang Kai absorbed gone?

That frenzied, destructive True Yang force should at the very least have raised his cultivation by two or three Stages.

Yet Yang Kai did not explain, and they did not press him; sometimes an increase in power is not so simply measured by cultivation alone. Unseen, the thirteen Blood Servants now felt a trace of oppression when facing Yang Kai.

It seemed that, if Yang Kai so wished, he could take their lives at any time.

They all shook their heads in bewilderment.

Having absorbed the True Spirit's power and reclaimed the Heavenly Journey Palace, at parting all of Yang Kai's wishes had been fulfilled.

The only regret he felt was that, during the battle with the True Spirit, Su Yan's Ice Jade Bed had been completely melted.

The grade of the Ice Jade Bed, after all, was no match for the True Spirit.

After staying in Zhongdu for another two or three days to arrange everything and bid farewell to friends and family, Yang Kai finally set out on his journey.

Shui Ling followed him with excitement, never once leaving his side.

Outside Zhongdu city a large crowd sent him off; many had moist eyes and reddened rims, reluctant to part.

Huo Xingchen drew a soft breath. "With Young Master Kai there, that foreign land will likely find no peace," he said, as if sensing something.

...

Flying along, Shui Ling was especially lively; having accidentally fallen into this world and been unable to find her way home for nearly two years, she now finally had hope of returning, and so she chattered happily all the way about the conditions in that foreign land.

Yang Kai paid her little mind, only listening to gather more information about that place.

Shui Ling was not offended and went on talking to herself; when tired she would rest for a while, then resume.

The two traveled at an even pace. As they flew, Yang Kai took in the various customs and scenery, feeling refreshed and filled with expectation and drive for the future.

Ten days later, Shui Ling still had not found a way home and could no longer contain herself; she asked, "Where are we?"

"Tianlang!"

"Tianlang?" Shui Ling puckered her lips. Having lived here two years, she had naturally heard of the Tianlang Kingdom — a country bordering Great Han, with rugged customs and barren land, utterly different from Great Han.

"No wonder these women are so shameless," Shui Ling muttered softly, her bright eyes fixed on several women walking nearby. Each was dressed outrageously revealing: above they wore only a single chest-binding that barely covered the front, showing deep cleavage, flat exposed midriffs, delicate navels and pink shoulders all bared.

Below they wore only tiny shorts; their long legs were arresting to the eye.

As those women passed by, their lips wore seductive smiles and they repeatedly made lascivious gestures at Yang Kai.

"What are we doing here? Weren't we supposed to be looking for the way to the Tongxuan Continent?" Shui Ling asked, puzzled.

The Tongxuan Continent was the name for that foreign land — a place rich in Spiritual Qi, dotted with Sects, where the strong rose in profusion.

"I'm looking for someone," Yang Kai answered casually, then raised his hand and called, "Ladies, wait a moment."

The women halted. The eldest among them giggled and cast a sidelong glance at Yang Kai. "Young man, what do you want?"

She wore an amused expression, as if appraising Yang Kai's build.

Yang Kai paid it no mind. From that Tianlang girl of years past he had long learned of Tianlang women's freedom of manner and knew such customs were common here.

"I want to ask for directions. How do you get to Senluo Palace?" Yang Kai asked bluntly, revealing nothing.

At these words the women's faces changed; the older girl eyed Yang Kai with caution and said in a low voice, "You want to go to Senluo Palace?"

After a pause she demanded, "What do you intend to do at Senluo Palace?"

Yang Kai frowned, sensing something, but still answered pleasantly, "I'm looking for someone. I left something with her."

"Who? What did you leave?" the girl continued to press.

Yang Kai smiled. Unfamiliar with this place, he had seized the rare chance to ask these girls for directions, yet he had not expected such wariness, as if he meant to do some wicked thing at Senluo Palace.

He did not wish to meddle in Tianlang's affairs or those of Senluo Palace; seeking Zi Mo of Tianlang was only to reclaim a strand of soul-thread he had once planted in her mind.

After all, Di Mo had warned that leaving such a thing in another's mind posed danger to oneself — if that person died, Yang Kai would suffer harm.

After reclaiming the soul-thread, Yang Kai also intended to have Zi Mo guide him to a certain forbidden place within Tianlang.

The girl's reaction was overly intense, which made Yang Kai somewhat impatient.

His expression suddenly twisted into a feral snarl; white, sharp fangs bared as he sneered, "No need to ask so many questions — just give me the answer."

Seeing his attitude swing so markedly, the other girls involuntarily took a step back, gathering their power with hostile expressions, ready to strike.

Yang Kai snorted lightly. A vast pressure descended from the sky, and the girls immediately felt as if carrying the weight of a mountain; their faces flushed and they panted for breath.

The older girl's face turned deathly pale as she finally grasped Yang Kai's terror. Her small hand made a furtive motion, as if scattering something onto the ground.

Yang Kai's eyes lit up. He stretched out a hand and a powerful suction emanated from his palm.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Several small things beneath the earth were drawn up to Yang Kai.

"Control Soul Insects?" Yang Kai's expression turned amused as he watched the writhing little bugs in his palm, inexplicably feeling a pang of fondness.

Back then in that foreign place, several warriors of the Tianlang Kingdom had used Control Soul Insects to control hundreds of Demonic Beasts and fighters from Dahan.

Zi Mo had tried to use that trick on Yang Kai, but he had easily dispersed it.

The insects the girl had secretly scattered onto the ground a moment ago were indeed a few Control Soul Insects, evidently intended to imitate Zi Mo's old method to control Yang Kai.

But such a technique could not succeed against Yang Kai.

As soon as those words were spoken, the girls all showed shock; the older girl cried out, "How do you know them?"

"Of course I know them," Yang Kai said with a self-satisfied smile.

"Impossible. Your dress makes you look like a warrior from Great Han; Control Soul Insects are our secret—there's no way you could have seen them," the girl protested.

"Your secret technique?" Yang Kai frowned, his bared fangs looking all the more fearsome. "What is your relation to Zi Mo?"

Astonishment shone in the girl's pretty eyes as she exclaimed, "You know my Senior Sister?"

"Senior Sister?" Yang Kai was taken aback; he had only asked casually and did not expect these girls to actually be connected to Zi Mo.

Zi Mo had once told him that those few were merely a branch of Senluo Palace, primarily studying control of exotic insects. Seeing this girl use Control Soul Insects earlier, Yang Kai suspected she was indeed linked to Zi Mo.

So they were Senior Sister and juniors... Yang Kai's expression grew strange; what a coincidence.

"Indeed, Zi Mo is our Senior Sister! How do you know her?" the girl pressed again.

"Knowing is knowing," Yang Kai frowned. "Since you are Zi Mo's Junior Sisters, you may have your Control Soul Insects back."

As he spoke, he tossed the few insects back to them.

The girl reached out to take them, sizing Yang Kai up from head to toe. Confusion clouded her pretty face; though still somewhat wary, fear dominated her expression.

"Take me to your Senior Sister. I have business with her," Yang Kai said calmly.

The girls stared at him and hesitated for a long moment before the older girl nodded slightly.

One must bow the head when under another's roof.

They led the way, Yang Kai and Shui Ling following behind. From time to time the girls glanced back and whispered; clearly they could not fathom how their Senior Sister would know a Great Han warrior, nor why his appearance suggested some entanglement with their Senior Sister.

Could he be here to seek revenge? The girls wondered inwardly, startled.

He looked around their age, yet his cultivation was beyond their comprehension—mysterious and unfathomable.

If he were truly here for vengeance, the girls were not afraid; after all, Senluo Palace had powerful figures. Him rushing in rashly would only be walking into a trap.

Thinking this, the girls relaxed and, walking along, casually drew conversation from Yang Kai to try to glean information.
