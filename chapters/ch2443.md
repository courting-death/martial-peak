## Chapter 2443 — Instant Kill

"Senior Brother Zhong, what... are you doing?" Only now did Yu Ying realize what was happening, staring at Zhong Zhenyong in shock, not understanding why he suddenly launched a sneak attack on Yang Kai.

After all, along the way, Zhong Zhenyong had always treated Yang Kai fairly well, joking and chatting with him. Why did he suddenly turn hostile the moment they arrived here? Yu Ying simply couldn't make sense of it.

"That's right, Senior Brother Zhong, what are you doing?" Yang Kai looked at Zhong Zhenyong coldly, his face dark as he said, "Did I, Feng, offend you in some way that you would try to kill me in secret?"

"Feng?" Zhong Zhenyong raised his eyebrows, then burst out laughing and said in a low voice, "Brother Feng, I’ll just ask you one question. If you answer well, I’ll apologize for what just happened. But if you can’t answer... heh heh..."

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and said, "Go ahead and ask, Senior Brother Zhong."

Zhong Zhenyong’s expression turned serious as he barked, "Brother Feng, in the Great Wilderness Star Domain, which Sect are you from? And how did you come to know Junior Brother Yin?"

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately fell into deep thought.

Zhong Zhenyong watched Yang Kai’s expression closely, not missing a single detail. Yu Ying stood to the side, glancing at one, then the other. Even if she was slow, she realized something was wrong. She furrowed her brows and quietly circulated her Origin Qi, watching Yang Kai warily.

After a moment, Yang Kai looked up at Zhong Zhenyong and said, "Senior Brother Zhong, that’s... two questions, isn’t it? You’re not keeping your word."

Zhong Zhenyong was taken aback, then snapped angrily, "Whether it’s one or two, just answer them!"

Yang Kai grinned, looking at Zhong Zhenyong thoughtfully. "Looks like Senior Brother Zhong has figured something out."

This man had suddenly attacked him, clearly because he’d gotten some information about him and realized that this Feng De was a fake.

"Senior Brother Zhong, what’s going on?" Yu Ying asked, her face turning ugly.

Zhong Zhenyong snorted coldly, pointing at Yang Kai. "Junior Sister Yu, this guy who’s been following you around as Feng De is a fake."

"A fake?" Yu Ying was stunned, looking at Yang Kai in astonishment.

"The real Feng De died long ago!"

"Dead?" Yu Ying murmured, dazed. "How could that be?"

If Feng De was dead, how did this man know so much about Senior Brother Yin? What was his relationship with Senior Brother Yin? Why did he impersonate Feng De to get close to Senior Brother Yin? Thinking about how she’d spent so much time with Yang Kai without ever seeing through his disguise, Yu Ying couldn’t help but shiver.

"The real Feng De died in the Starlight Passage. Junior Brother Yin saw it with his own eyes—there’s no way it’s false. And this man before you has a grudge with Junior Brother Yin." Zhong Zhenyong sneered at Yang Kai. "Am I wrong, Brother Yang?"

He emphasized the words "Brother Yang" heavily.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in surprise. "Oh? You even know my surname. Looks like the one who sent you the message must be Yin Lesheng, right?"

As he spoke, his eyes lit up slightly, glancing toward that strange, dark red star.

Although Zhong Zhenyong hadn’t mentioned where Yin Lesheng was now, Yang Kai was ninety percent sure Yin Lesheng was inside that star. Otherwise, Zhong Zhenyong wouldn’t have been able to contact him and ask about Yang Kai.

"That’s right." Zhong Zhenyong didn’t deny it. "All of this was told to me by Junior Brother Yin. No matter what grudge you have with him, you won’t get the chance to take revenge."

As he spoke, a trace of ferocity and greed appeared on Zhong Zhenyong’s face. He looked at Yang Kai like a starving wolf eyeing a piece of fat meat.

"Who are you really? Why did you deceive me!" Yu Ying was furious, her beautiful eyes blazing as she glared at Yang Kai, killing intent written all over her face.

Yang Kai glanced at her coldly. "What a heartless woman. I even saved your life before, and now you dare show killing intent toward me? Truly disappointing!"

Yu Ying shouted, "So what? You dared to deceive me, so you deserve to die!" She turned to Zhong Zhenyong. "Senior Brother Zhong, this man possesses a complete Stellar Origin. If you can obtain it, it’ll be of immense benefit to you."

Zhong Zhenyong licked his lips excitedly. "Of course I know that."

In the Netherworld Sect, although he believed his current strength was not much weaker than Yin Lesheng’s, with Yin Lesheng’s terrifying rate of progress, it was only a matter of time before he surpassed him. The greatest reason for Yin Lesheng’s rapid improvement was his identity as a Star Lord, possessing a complete Stellar Origin.

This was a fortune no cultivator could ever hope for.

But now, another cultivator with a complete Stellar Origin was right in front of him. This Origin was completely different from the broken origins of the Shattered Star Sea. If he could obtain it, the benefits would be unimaginable. He would never have to worry about being surpassed by Yin Lesheng again. With both of them possessing complete Stellar Origins, it would all come down to diligence and perseverance in cultivation—and in that, Zhong Zhenyong was confident he was second to none.

Suddenly, Yang Kai asked, "So Yin Lesheng really is on that star now?"

Zhong Zhenyong snorted coldly. "What’s the point of asking such questions when you’re already a dead man?"

Yang Kai laughed coldly. "Since I’ve found Yin Lesheng, there’s no need to let you two live!"

Zhong Zhenyong was stunned for a moment, then flew into a rage. "You arrogant brat! No one has ever dared speak to me like that before! Taste the power of the Netherworld Infernal Banner—prepare to die!"

As he finished speaking, he suddenly summoned a black banner. From within, the wails of ghosts and howls of wolves echoed, stirring up a sinister wind and endless chill, as if it could freeze a person’s Divine Soul.

As the Netherworld Infernal Banner unfurled, the rolling yin energy condensed into something tangible, like the waters of the Yellow Springs, surging toward Yang Kai.

Seeing Zhong Zhenyong use his trump card right away, Yu Ying’s face changed and she quickly retreated to avoid being caught up in the attack.

"Good stuff! This would make a fine gift for Ghost Ancestor." Yang Kai’s eyes lit up as he looked at the Netherworld Infernal Banner. This strange Secret Treasure was quite similar to Ghost Ancestor’s Ten Thousand Souls Banner—likely from the same origin—but the Netherworld Infernal Banner was of much higher grade.

Yang Kai could even sense a faint trace of Imperial Might from it.

In other words, this Secret Treasure had likely been personally refined by an Emperor Realm expert and already had the makings of an Imperial Treasure, though it wasn’t fully formed yet. Once Zhong Zhenyong advanced to the Emperor Realm, he could use Imperial Aura to nurture the Netherworld Infernal Banner, and it would eventually become a true Imperial Treasure.

No wonder he was a top-three disciple of a great Sect—his methods were truly extraordinary.

The clamorous wails and howls were like demonic music piercing the ears, filled with a strange power that could affect the mind of any opponent. Zhong Zhenyong was clearly planning to finish Yang Kai in one move, giving him no chance to fight back.

The allure of a complete Stellar Origin was simply too great!

Yang Kai composed himself, raised his hands, and quickly formed a series of seals.

After a few complex movements, a mysterious power suddenly spread out in all directions. The wondrous power of Law scattered through the void, surging to the four corners.

Zhong Zhenyong’s eyes bulged as he suddenly sensed something was wrong. In that instant, he felt his thoughts and every movement slow down, and even the world around him seemed to freeze.

The only thing that didn’t freeze was the man who had been impersonating Feng De.

What kind of divine ability was this! Zhong Zhenyong’s face changed drastically, a chill rising in his heart.

Even though Yang Kai hadn’t finished forming his seals, Zhong Zhenyong already sensed danger—this Yang fellow was not to be trifled with.

In the next moment, a whisper echoed in his mind, shaking his very soul.

"The years wither and flourish, like a shuttle, like a dream!"

An unprecedented sense of crisis erupted. At the critical moment, Zhong Zhenyong bit his tongue and spat out a mouthful of Essence-Blood.

As the blood sprayed out, the strange stillness around him finally broke, and everything came back to life. But as he looked up, a giant seal was already descending upon him, leaving him no chance to dodge.

Boom...

A dull thud sounded, and Zhong Zhenyong froze in place.

He didn’t feel the impact he expected, nor did he sense any wounds, but to his horror, a strange power invaded his body. His vitality and lifespan began to drain away at an unbelievable speed. In the blink of an eye, it was as if hundreds or thousands of years had passed over him.

"Senior Brother Zhong!" Yu Ying screamed, her eyes wide with disbelief as she stared at Zhong Zhenyong, as if witnessing something terrifying.

Zhong Zhenyong seemed to realize something too. He slowly raised a withered, stick-like hand to his eyes, then trembled as he asked, "You... what did you do to me...?"

Yang Kai looked at him coldly, then raised his hand and sent a Moon Blade slashing toward him.

If Zhong Zhenyong had been at his peak, he might have dodged this attack. But now, aged and feeble, with ninety percent of his vitality and Qi and blood drained, he couldn’t react at all.

The pitch-black Moon Blade swept through Zhong Zhenyong’s body, slicing him cleanly in two.

Yu Ying’s face instantly turned pale.

Dead. Senior Brother Zhong Zhenyong was actually dead—just like that, killed in utter confusion.

This Senior Brother, ranked top three in the Sect and considered a young genius in the Eastern Territory and even the entire Star Realm, was killed in the blink of an eye by a cultivator of the same level.

If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, Yu Ying would never have believed it.

But the truth was right in front of her, leaving no room for doubt.

Only now did she realize that Yang Kai had been hiding his strength all along. When he fought Chang Hao of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land and spat blood, that was just an act! How laughable that she’d naively thought Yang Kai wasn’t a match for Chang Hao.
