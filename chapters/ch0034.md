## Chapter 34 — Dragon Confinement Ravine

After walking for a short while, an immense ravine appeared before him, so vast it seemed to span the heavens and earth. A fierce wind blew directly at Yang Kai, nearly knocking him off his feet.

Snapping back to his senses, Yang Kai looked up and was instantly stunned.

How could it be here? The ravine before him was over a thousand zhang wide, seemingly bottomless, its length immeasurable. This was none other than Lingxiao Pavilion’s most perilous and mysterious place—the Dragon Confinement Ravine!

The very existence of this ravine was strange. Lingxiao Pavilion was not situated in the mountains but on a flat plain. This ravine was less a mountain gorge and more a massive fissure in the earth—only far larger than any ordinary crack.

The Dragon Confinement Ravine was a forbidden zone within Lingxiao Pavilion, a place of extraordinary danger. The howling winds were relentless, and one careless step could send a person plummeting to certain death.

It was also the place where Lingxiao Pavilion exiled traitors and rebellious disciples. For centuries, whenever someone committed unforgivable acts of treachery, their cultivation would be stripped away, and they would be cast into the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Yang Kai found this hard to understand. If someone was truly treasonous, why not simply execute them? Why choose exile? To be stripped of one’s cultivation and thrown here was effectively a death sentence.

Of course, besides being a place of exile, the ravine was also the preferred site for many star-crossed lovers to end their lives together.

Countless tales circulated within Lingxiao Pavilion—tales of love and sacrifice. After the death of a beloved, some refused to live on and chose to leap into the ravine. These moving stories were well known.

Almost every male disciple in Lingxiao Pavilion harbored one or two such stories in their hearts, waiting for the right moment to impress a maiden. If they could make the beloved weep with sorrow, then reveal a broad chest and warm embrace, success was all but guaranteed.

These touching stories had forged countless romantic legends, becoming a great source of inspiration for the male disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion.

As these thoughts swirled in his mind, Yang Kai took a few cautious steps forward and glanced into the seemingly bottomless ravine, his heart filled with confusion.

How could there be True Yang Primordial Qi here? Moreover, it was unlike the energy he had sensed earlier. The ravine was suffused with a dense, vibrant Yang Qi that continuously rose from its depths. Even standing at the edge, Yang Kai could feel a faint warmth in the air.

This warmth was not the power of the sun, yet it was incomparably purer.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai sat down on the ground, choosing not to dwell on the cause but to absorb the energy. The True Yang Technique was best cultivated in an environment rich with Yang Qi, accelerating the speed of progress.

His internal Primordial Qi was scarce, and the True Yang Technique operated slowly, but with this abundant Yang Qi aiding him, his cultivation should advance much faster.

It was dusk, the sun setting behind the western mountains. Though little sunlight remained, Yang Kai still felt his cultivation efficiency was far higher than in previous days.

He cultivated through the entire night. When dawn broke, he opened his eyes to assess his progress.

The difference between having Yang Qi and not having it was remarkable. Previously, even under the sun, it had taken him three days to generate a small amount of Primordial Qi. Now, in just one night, he had achieved what would have taken three days before—a startling increase in efficiency.

His internal Primordial Qi had grown stronger, no longer flickering like a candle in the wind.

Moreover, as his Primordial Qi strengthened, Yang Kai found it easier to control.

With the new day, Yang Kai ceased cultivating the True Yang Technique and instead practiced the Body Tempering Chapter for half an hour.

By the Dragon Confinement Ravine, sweat poured from him like rain. Despite having cultivated all night, he felt no fatigue, only vibrant energy.

After finishing the Body Tempering Chapter, Yang Kai completed his task as the sweeper boy and then hurried back.

His Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs were nearly depleted, and the incense burner could no longer be used. Thus, cultivating here remained his only option.

Originally, Yang Kai had intended to confront Su Mu and the others, but strangely, since that night, Su Mu and his group seemed to have vanished from Lingxiao Pavilion without a trace.

Though Yang Kai held some grudges against them, it was not true enmity. Their conflicts were more for his own amusement and to test his growth. He had not taken their nighttime ambush seriously.

If the roles were reversed, anyone with the power to retaliate would surely seek revenge.

Returning to the edge of the Dragon Confinement Ravine, ignoring the gale that could have blown away a living person, Yang Kai focused his mind. The scant Primordial Qi within him surged through his meridians repeatedly.

The circulation of Primordial Qi seemed to awaken a mysterious power, causing every pore on his skin to open wide. The Yang Qi in the air was like a cat smelling blood, eagerly rushing into his body.

A warm sensation spread through him, as if bathing in hot water. Yang Kai relaxed completely, feeling utterly comfortable.

Two hurried days passed, and Yang Kai reaped great rewards.

With these two days of cultivation, his Primordial Qi had grown significantly, now imbued with a gentle Yang Flame.

This was the most obvious sign of cultivating the True Yang Technique, for the Primordial Qi was formed by absorbing Yang energy and was naturally Yang in nature.
