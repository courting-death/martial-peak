## Chapter 2493 — A Word of Caution

This old man could see that Zhang Ruoxi’s bloodline was extraordinary, even able to seal a Divine Spirit’s Spirit Essence with her Essence-Blood, and he recognized the ferocious beast Qiong Qi, and directly named the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor. If he were just an ordinary Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, there’s no way Yang Kai would believe it.

“Mm, I can’t tell you that either!”

Yang Kai was furious and snapped, “Then what can you tell me?”

The old man thought for a moment, then patted Yang Kai’s shoulder and said earnestly, “Cultivate well and reach the Emperor Realm as soon as you can. The future of the Star Realm depends on you all.”

“Get lost!”

The old man wasn’t angry at all. He just looked at him with a smile, then turned around, his expression turning solemn as he called out loudly, “Everyone, if you’ll heed this old man’s advice, please leave this place at once. It’s very dangerous here. If you stay any longer, your lives will be at risk.”

Liang Qiu laughed and said, “You really are an interesting old fellow. Whether it’s dangerous or not, we know best. There’s no need for your reminder.”

Earlier, his spear strike had been casually neutralized by the old man, so he knew that although this old man was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, his strength was unfathomable. He didn’t dare look down on him at all. If it were any other Dao Origin Realm saying such things, he would have already attacked with his spear.

“You seem quite knowledgeable. Why not tell us whose remains these are? Which Great Emperor left behind that skeleton?” Liang Qiu changed the subject, bringing up the skeleton hidden in the black hole.

Earlier, because Mo Xiaoqi’s Sacred Soul Seal had suddenly been released, everyone’s attention had been drawn away, filled with fear and anxiety, so no one had the mind to pay attention to the Great Emperor’s skeleton and the Spatial Ring.

But now that the crisis of the Sacred Soul Seal had been resolved, everyone’s attention naturally shifted back to the Spatial Ring.

Liang Qiu’s question hit the mark, and everyone looked at the old man curiously, hoping he would give an explanation.

The old man’s expression grew serious. “No matter which Great Emperor left these things behind, it no longer matters. Back then, the battle among the Emperors was fierce, the sun and moon lost their light, and only a few things were left behind. All the other Secret Treasures were smashed to pieces. There’s nothing good left in that Spatial Ring, so you’d best not covet it.”

“You think I’ll just believe you?” Liang Qiu snorted coldly.

“I believe him!” Lan Xun suddenly stepped forward and shouted.

Liang Qiu glanced at her and curled his lip. Lan Xun was the daughter of the Radiant Moon Great Emperor. Since she stood up to support the old man at this moment, he couldn’t argue against her.

Lan Xun said, “Senior, what exactly is so dangerous about this place? If it’s convenient, could you tell us?”

The old man frowned. “It’s a matter of life and death, Miss Lan. Take your people and leave here at once.”

Hearing this, Lan Xun pondered for a moment, then nodded. “Since Senior says so, I’ll take my leave. Please take care, Senior.”

As she spoke, she glanced at Yang Kai. Seeing his indifferent expression, she didn’t try to persuade him. She just looked at the martial artists watching from afar and called out, “Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters from the Southern Territory, if you trust me, Lan Xun, leave this place at once!”

After saying this, she immediately sped off into the distance. Although Xiao Chen was a bit unwilling, as a proper protector, he naturally wouldn’t leave Lan Xun’s side and followed after her.

As soon as she left, many of the Southern Territory elites among the distant onlookers summoned their Secret Treasures and left as well.

It was clear that the Star God Palace’s influence in the Southern Territory was immense. No one else could have achieved such an effect.

In an instant, the crowd shrank by several hundred.

Xia Sheng, Xiao Baiyi, and Murong Xiaoxiao whispered among themselves for a while. It seemed they also felt the old man wasn’t just making things up. They secretly sent a message to Yang Kai and soon left as well.

If Xia Sheng were alone, he might not have left, since he was also in the Emperor Realm. But with Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao with him, he had to consider their safety and didn’t dare risk their lives.

“Yao Si. You go too!” The old man turned his head and looked in Yao Si’s direction, calling out calmly.

Yao Si raised his eyebrows and said coldly, “I’ll stay wherever I want. No one can order me around!”

As the son of a Great Emperor, he was naturally extremely proud. Although the old man had shown some astonishing ability earlier, it was still too soon for him to take orders from him.

Hearing this, the old man sighed, then suddenly waved his hand. A streak of light shot toward Yao Si like lightning.

Yao Si’s expression changed. He hurriedly activated his Emperor Yuan and retreated rapidly, trying to dodge the attack.

But to his shock, the streak of light was unbelievably fast—he couldn’t avoid it at all, and even his protective Emperor Yuan was useless.

The light struck him directly.

Yao Si couldn’t help but stagger back several steps, his face turning pale.

“Old man, how dare you launch a sneak attack!” Liang Qiu shouted in anger and surprise.

He was angry that the old man had attacked without warning, and shocked that even Yao Si couldn’t withstand his sneak attack. Such strength was truly terrifying.

Red Ghost, Wuchang, and many other Emperor Realm experts all looked grim.

They had advanced to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea, thinking they could roam the Star Realm as they pleased from now on. But before even leaving the Shattered Star Sea, their morale had been crushed by this old man again and again.

If he could so easily ambush Yao Si, wouldn’t it be just as easy for him to ambush the rest of them?

From now on, whenever they encountered a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, they’d have to be careful. Otherwise, they might die without even knowing how.

Over there, Liang Qiu, furious, had already summoned his spear, ready to fight the old man to the death. Earlier, Yao Si had called him a friend, which had moved Liang Qiu. Now that Yao Si was in trouble, he naturally wouldn’t stand by and do nothing.

But before he could act, Yao Si suddenly reached out and stopped him, saying sternly, “I’m fine. Don’t be impulsive!”

Liang Qiu turned his head, looking at Yao Si in astonishment.

But Yao Si’s expression was solemn. He glanced inexplicably at his own palm, then suddenly shuddered, staring at the old man in shock and exclaiming, “You are…!”

The old man raised a finger to his lips and gently shushed him.

Yao Si understood, quickly swallowed the rest of his words, and respectfully cupped his fists. “I was ignorant and spoke out of turn earlier. Please, sir, don’t hold it against this junior!”

As soon as he spoke, the whole crowd was in an uproar. Everyone stared at him in disbelief, utterly shocked.

Yao Si was the son of the Great Emperor Youhun, with extraordinary talent, and now in the Emperor Realm. In the entire Star Realm, aside from a few people who could make him bow his head, no one else—no matter how strong—could make him say such words.

Yet now, facing this old man, his attitude and tone were respectful, even a little… humble!

The son of a Great Emperor, acting humble and calling himself a junior before an old man at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—what was going on?

But with this, everyone understood: the old man’s earlier strike wasn’t a sneak attack, but a way to convey some message to Yao Si. It was through this message that Yao Si realized his identity and became so respectful.

The old man chuckled and said, “It was a last resort. As long as Young Master Yao Si doesn’t mind this old man’s rashness.”

Yao Si said solemnly, “Senior, you’re too serious!”

The old man nodded. “Good. Now take them and leave.”

Yao Si replied, “I will obey your command, sir!”

As he spoke, he looked up and said coldly, “If you don’t want to die, follow me!”

Liang Qiu protested, “Are we really leaving? But there’s still a…”

Before he could finish, he saw Yao Si’s icy eyes fixed on him, so cold and emotionless that Liang Qiu couldn’t help but shudder.

He could only twitch his mouth and say, “Let’s go, let’s go.”

Yao Si withdrew his gaze, his figure flickering as he sped off into the distance.

Red Ghost and the others, though full of doubts, had no choice but to follow. Staying behind now would be disrespectful to Yao Si. Red Ghost’s Ahan Palace was also in the Eastern Territory—offending Yao Si would bring nothing but trouble in the future.

In a rush, nearly all the Emperor Realm experts left. Wuchang thought for a long time, but in the end, he left as well.

After all, even the descendants of two Great Emperors, Lan Xun and Yao Si, had been persuaded to leave by this old man. Judging by Yao Si’s reaction, this old man was probably someone truly extraordinary.

Someone like him had no need to make empty threats. Staying any longer would really put their lives at risk.

Not only did all the Emperor Realm experts leave, but a large number of the remaining Dao Origin Realm cultivators also departed.

In the blink of an eye, fewer than a thousand Dao Origin Realm cultivators remained, still watching from the sidelines. These Dao Origin Realm cultivators probably hadn’t gained much in the Shattered Star Sea, so even though the old man’s advice was earnest, he couldn’t persuade them to leave.

The Great Emperor’s skeleton and the Spatial Ring in the black hole were what attracted them most.

“You’re not leaving?” The old man saw Yang Kai still standing there and frowned.

Yang Kai said in a deep voice, “Tell me what’s going on with Ruoxi’s bloodline, and I’ll leave immediately!”

The old man replied, “You’ll find out in due time.”

“If you won’t tell me, I’ll just follow you,” Yang Kai said shamelessly.

The old man looked him up and down, then grinned. “You really are thick-skinned. How did Wen Zishan end up with a disciple like you?”

Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly. “How do you know I’m from Qingyang Shrine?”

He had never revealed this information since arriving here.

The old man chuckled, pointing to a spot on Yang Kai’s body.

Yang Kai suddenly understood—it was the Qingyang Gold Token he kept close that had given him away. Earlier, to better sense the messages from Xiao Baiyi, Murong Xiaoxiao, and the others, he had taken the Qingyang Gold Token out of his Spatial Ring and kept it on him. He hadn’t expected the old man to notice such a small detail.

The old man shook his head. “When the upper beam is crooked, the lower beam is slanted. If I ever meet Wen Zishan, I’ll have him expel you from the sect!”
