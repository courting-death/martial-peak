## Chapter 2244 — The Strange Insects Manual

Blood Aphid, Two-Legged Silkworm, Iron Ant, Silver-Patterned Six-Horned Spider, Tyrant Bee…

On top of each wine jar was the name of a strange insect or beast. Yang Kai had hardly ever heard of most of these names, with only one or two being remotely familiar to him.

And those very few that he did know were all terrifying creatures that would make any cultivator turn pale at the mention of them.

Yang Kai’s mind trembled, and he faintly began to form a bold guess.

Just then, within the internal space of the Slave-Insect Bracelet, a brilliant light suddenly flashed. In that light, something resembling a book slowly appeared within Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

Driven by curiosity, Yang Kai used his Divine Sense to investigate.

On the front of the tome, several large characters were inscribed in seal script: “Strange Insects Manual.”

“A Divine Sense Book!” Yang Kai exclaimed inwardly.

In this world, there were some extremely profound secret arts and techniques that did not exist in physical form, but were instead recorded in ways invisible to the naked eye, hidden in secret places.

Recording them in this way could prevent precious information from being easily obtained by others. It was also a common method used by many experts before their end.

The Divine Sense Book was one such method.

The Divine Sense Book inside the Slave-Insect Bracelet was most likely written by the Insect Emperor, because Yang Kai could sense the Insect Emperor’s aura from this Strange Insect Manual. Even after so many years, Yang Kai could still remember that unique aura.

Yang Kai moved his Divine Sense again, opening the Strange Insects Manual and reading it carefully.

The Strange Insects Manual was indeed authored by the Insect Emperor; the very first page contained a preface written by the Insect Emperor himself. Yang Kai was not interested in this, so he skimmed it and turned the page.

“Strange Insect Ranking!”

These three large characters immediately entered Yang Kai’s sight, making his expression brighten as he examined them closely.

The Strange Insect Ranking was divided by the Insect Emperor into two lists: Heaven and Earth. Any strange insect or beast that could make it onto these lists was an extremely rare and troublesome existence in the world.

Thirty-six on the Heaven List, seventy-two on the Earth List, for a total of one hundred and eight strange insects and beasts, each with detailed descriptions and rankings.

Yang Kai quickly found the descriptions of the strange insects that existed in those wine jars on this ranking.

Blood Aphid: Earth List Thirteen. Drawn to blood. Extremely small and hard to detect. Anyone afflicted will have all their blood drained, becoming a dried corpse.

Two-Legged Silkworm: Earth List Twenty-Seven. Pure white body, stands on two legs, possesses the most potent ice poison in the world. There is no cure for those afflicted.

Iron Ant: Earth List Thirty-Six. Lives in colonies. Devours iron and steel, can destroy any Secret Treasure in the world.

Silver-Patterned Six-Horned Spider: Heaven List Nineteen. Silver patterns on its back, extremely poisonous. Even experts at the Emperor Realm cannot withstand it.

Tyrant Bee: Heaven List Twenty-One. Its stinger’s poison is among the top ten poisons in the world. Already extinct.

…

There were many more, too numerous to list.

In the Heaven List, Yang Kai found the description and introduction of the Soul-Devouring Worms.

Soul-Devouring Worms: Heaven List Eleven. Specializes in devouring Divine Soul power, the nemesis of Divine Souls. When young, they can be killed by Divine Sense Fire or suppressed by overwhelming Divine Sense, but if they grow, they become extremely troublesome—even Emperors cannot subdue them.

In this Strange Insect Ranking, the Soul-Devouring Worms were ranked eleventh on the Heaven List, which was already a very high position. As for the ten types of strange insects ranked above them, Yang Kai had never even heard of them.

According to the Insect Emperor’s notes, those ten strongest strange insects had all gone extinct and no longer existed in the world.

Of course, that was just his personal opinion. Whether they were truly extinct, no one could say for sure.

Yang Kai suspected their high rank was likely due to their immense potential for growth.

Just as the Insect Emperor’s notes said, Soul-Devouring Worms are not difficult to deal with when they are weak—Divine Sense Fire can kill them, and powerful Divine Sense can suppress them. But if they grow, they become a huge problem.

The Holy War in the Divine Roaming World was the best example of this.

Suddenly obtaining such a strange book, Yang Kai couldn’t help but become interested, eagerly flipping through it. Since the Insect Emperor dared to take such a title, it meant that his research in the field of strange insects and beasts was second to none. His knowledge was likely unique in the entire Star Realm. With this in hand, if Yang Kai ever encountered any strange insects from the Heaven or Earth Lists, he would not be caught unprepared.

In the Strange Insects Manual, after the Heaven and Earth Lists, there were detailed introductions to the habits, methods of raising, and ways to restrain each type of strange insect.

Most strange insects and beasts had specific methods to restrain them. For example, the Blood Aphid of the Earth List Thirteen, though drawn to blood and extremely tiny—so small that even Divine Sense might not detect them—were most afraid of fire. Any fire-type secret art or divine ability was enough to make them retreat.

Another example was the Iron Ant of the Earth List Thirty-Six. Although it was the bane of Secret Treasures, it feared a special stone called Moonlight Stone. If an Iron Ant swallowed this stone, it would soon dissolve into liquid and die completely.

The key point was that Moonlight Stone was not particularly rare; it was just a type of illuminating stone with little practical value. Across the Star Realm, it could be found in many places.

Yang Kai deliberately searched for the method to restrain the Soul-Devouring Worms.

The Insect Emperor only provided two methods. One was to use Divine Sense Fire to kill them while they were weak. The second was suppression, because once they grew strong enough to no longer fear Divine Sense Fire, they could no longer be killed—suppression was the only option left.

After reading through, Yang Kai gained a lot and also had some ideas about how to handle the Soul-Devouring Worms he possessed.

Half a day later, Yang Kai closed the Strange Insects Manual.

Just as it had appeared, it vanished without warning—a flash of light, and it was gone from that space.

However, Yang Kai was now the master of the Slave-Insect Bracelet. As long as he willed it, he could summon the Strange Insects Manual at any time in the future.

Immediately, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense, focused his mind, and while unleashing the power of the Slave-Insect Bracelet, guided the Soul-Devouring Worms from the Warm Spirit Lotus, intending to transfer them into the Slave-Insect Bracelet.

The batch of Soul-Devouring Worms he originally possessed was not difficult to handle. Although they had shown a rebellious side in the Divine Roaming World, under the suppression of the Slave-Insect Bracelet’s aura, they now obediently allowed themselves to be transferred into the bracelet’s space.

However, the Soul-Devouring Worms that had been sealed away made Yang Kai extra cautious.

That sealed ball of light, protected by both the power of a Great Emperor and the Heaven and Earth power of the Divine Roaming Mirror’s Mirror Soul, was doubly insured, but Yang Kai still dared not be careless.

After much effort, he finally managed to transfer them safely into the world of the Slave-Insect Bracelet.

Only at this moment did he unconsciously let out a breath.

Now that there were no more Soul-Devouring Worms in his body, he naturally had nothing to worry about.

Both batches of Soul-Devouring Worms were transferred by Yang Kai into an unused wine jar.

These wine jars were vessels crafted by the Insect Emperor in the past using extremely rare and precious materials, specifically for raising strange insects and beasts.

The dangerous auras Yang Kai sensed from these vessels were all left behind by the strange insects and beasts of the Insect Emperor’s era. Although tens of thousands of years had passed, in the special environment of the Slave-Insect Bracelet, nourished by that unique power, these strange insects and beasts had not weakened—instead, they had become even stronger than before.

Yang Kai did not dare to release them at all.

Since he had not raised these strange insects and beasts himself, Yang Kai was not fully confident he could enslave them. If he released them and they refused to obey, he would only be bringing disaster upon himself.

He could only wait until his own strength improved before gradually attempting it.

For now, the most important thing was to deal with the Soul-Devouring Worms.

With both groups of Soul-Devouring Worms placed in a single wine jar, Yang Kai sealed it tightly. Then, using his Divine Sense, he formed hand seals and used a secret art to undo Tian Yan’s seal.

In the next moment, a buzzing sound came from within the wine jar.

Yang Kai listened for a while, and his face involuntarily turned a little pale.

He could clearly sense that the two groups of Soul-Devouring Worms were now like two armies, engaged in a fierce and earth-shaking battle inside the wine jar.

However, since their strengths were not too different, the battle was especially intense and bloody. Inside the wine jar, it was as if a storm of blood and blades was raging.

Still, Yang Kai was not worried.

The Strange Insects Manual also noted that this was a natural method and means for the Soul-Devouring Worms to survive and evolve.

Although they had no intelligence, they possessed their own instincts.

Just like with Gu techniques, a Gu refiner would place various poisonous creatures in a space and let them fight to the death. The last survivor would become the strongest Gu.

The evolution and growth of the Soul-Devouring Worms was exactly the same, and this was driven by their instincts—no method could suppress it.

However, this process of evolution could be stimulated by external means.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense from the Slave-Insect Bracelet, shook the token in his hand, opened the cave mansion’s barrier, and flew out.

Soon, he arrived at the summit of Purple Bamboo Peak. After looking around, he quickly found the location of Gao Xueting’s cave mansion.

Flying over, Yang Kai stood outside the cave mansion, just about to call out when Gao Xueting’s voice suddenly came from inside: “Come in!”

Yang Kai was taken aback, but a trace of gratitude appeared on his face.

Gao Xueting was able to sense his presence so quickly, partly because her cultivation was strong, and also likely because she had been paying attention to his movements during this period.

This was not surveillance, but protection.

She had probably heard some things from Wen Zishan, so during the days Yang Kai was in seclusion, she had never let her guard down.

Yang Kai said nothing more and flew straight into the cave mansion.

Twisting and turning through the cave, Yang Kai soon arrived at a stone chamber.

This should be where Gao Xueting lived and rested.

Looking around, Yang Kai was surprised to find that the cave mansion was extremely simple, with almost no furnishings—just a meditation cushion and a bamboo bed, nothing else.

Gao Xueting was sitting on the bamboo bed at this moment, gazing at him calmly.
