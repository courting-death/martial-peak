## Chapter 1937 — New Realm

In the cave, Yang Kai tended his wounds while asking Liu Qianyun about the Star Realm; the woman was frank, speaking plainly and without reserve, which considerably improved Yang Kai's impression of her.

"So that means the realm above the Void King Realm is the Dao Origin Realm, and above that is the Emperor Realm?"

Liu Qianyun nodded. "Correct. Only when a martial artist's Shi field was fully formed could they break through to the Void King Realm and comprehend the Domain Field; when the Domain Field matured, they could breakthrough the Void King Realm and perceive the power of the Laws, and what Dao Origin Realm practitioners mastered was precisely the power of the Laws."

"The power of the Laws!" Yang Kai showed a look of reverence.

Liu Qianyun smiled slightly and said, "Brother Yang, don't overthink it; even Dao Origin Realm experts could only make simple use of the power of the Laws. I have heard that only upon reaching the Emperor Realm can one truly master the Laws—that is when a single thought can change seas into mulberry fields and words carry the force of Law!"

"I understand!" Yang Kai nodded.

"Of course, comprehending the power of the Laws is only a basic requirement for ascending to the Dao Origin Realm. Another most important condition is converting one's own power into Origin Qi!"

"Origin Qi?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened. "Is that the name for the new power we have in our bodies?"

"Correct. Origin Qi is a level higher than Saint Yuan. Brother Yang must have felt it—this new power is closely linked to one's own Origin, hence it is called Origin Qi."

He indeed felt it.

"Within that Starlight Passage, the greatest function of the starlight is to accelerate the conversion of a Void King Realm practitioner's Saint Yuan into Origin Qi. So the more starlight one can absorb inside the Starlight Passage, the better," Liu Qianyun explained.

"You stayed in there for five years, so you must have absorbed a lot?" Yang Kai's face turned serious.

Liu Qianyun shook her head with a wry smile. "Brother Yang, you're thinking too much. Although we were there for five years, the time we actually spent absorbing starlight totaled less than two months; the rest of the time we hid under the Netherworld Domain Veil."

"The Netherworld Domain Veil?" Yang Kai raised a brow.

"Yes, it's Senior Brother Yin's defensive Secret Treasure, a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure. It's said to have come down from the Netherworld Sect of the Star Realm. Senior Brother was carrying it; without its protection we would have been expelled from the Starlight Passage long ago and could not have stayed there for five years."

"What do you mean by that?" Yang Kai was astonished.

"The starlight inside the Starlight Passage brings tremendous benefits to martial artists—especially those of us coming from low-level Star Domains to the Star Realm. That starlight is our first real opportunity. But do you really think a martial artist can linger there at will?" Liu Qianyun smiled. "That's impossible. No one can stay in the Starlight Passage for longer than two months; when the time is up, the passage's heaven-and-earth laws will expel them."

Only then did Yang Kai look enlightened.

He had already suspected that if every martial artist could remain in the Starlight Passage for years, it would be disastrous for those from low-level Star Domains.

If someone like Yin Lesheng were to control the Starlight Passage, no one else would stand a chance.

Now, after Liu Qianyun's explanation, he understood it was the work of the Netherworld Domain Veil.

"The Starlight Passage's starlight accelerates the conversion of Saint Yuan into Origin Qi; naturally, the more absorbed the better—especially for Star Lord practitioners, who possess a Stellar Origin and thus have great affinity for starlight, absorbing it far faster than ordinary martial artists," Liu Qianyun said, then suddenly paused, her pretty eyes widening as she sized Yang Kai up in astonishment.

"What is it?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Strange!" Liu Qianyun knit her brows, speaking with surprise and doubt. "Brother Yang, aren't you a Star Lord?"

In the Starlight Passage she had clearly seen the surrounding starlight surge into Yang Kai like water being sucked by a whale—that was the most obvious sign of a Star Lord; that speed was something even Yin Lesheng could not match.

Another Star Lord who had accompanied Yang Kai had not even reached one tenth of that speed.

"I am a Star Lord!" Yang Kai did not hide it; after all, it had already been exposed inside the Starlight Passage.

"Then why is there no starlight on your body?" Liu Qianyun's expression became even stranger.

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai looked at her in puzzlement.

Liu Qianyun explained, "When Star Lord practitioners first enter the Star Realm, because they absorb so much starlight in the Starlight Passage that they cannot refine it at once, a layer of stellar radiance appears on their bodies. That stellar radiance is obvious; only after they absorb and fuse all that starlight does the stellar radiance disappear. But you..."

Yang Kai looked down and found no trace of stellar radiance on his body.

Then he turned his thoughts inward and checked his Sea of Consciousness, discovering it filled with starlight—especially the region where the Warm Spirit Lotus resided; the starlight there was unimaginably dense.

He relaxed at once, realizing the starlight he had yet to fuse had gathered in his Sea of Consciousness.

Liu Qianyun had not been mistaken; Yang Kai's situation was simply unusual, and it related to the Warm Spirit Lotus—he did not bother to explain.

"Could it be related to the final shattering of the Starlight Passage?" Liu Qianyun frowned, thinking of a possible explanation.

"Perhaps!" Yang Kai immediately seized upon the idea.

Liu Qianyun glanced at him and did not press the matter further, smiling slightly. "In any case, having no stellar radiance on your body will make you much safer, Brother Yang."

"Why is that?" Yang Kai asked.

"Because of the Stellar Origin," Liu Qianyun explained. "Why did Senior Brother Yin target you? It's because he wanted to seize your Stellar Origin. In the Star Realm, Stellar Origin is highly prized. Those with Stellar Origin can more easily comprehend the power of heaven-and-earth's laws and more readily ascend to the Dao Origin Realm and become an Emperor. Hence everyone covets Stellar Origin; if you bear visible stellar radiance on your body, wouldn't that announce to others that you just came out of the Starlight Passage as a Star Lord and tempt them to make a move? You must know there are more than one secret arts in the Star Realm for stripping others of their Stellar Origin. I must warn you: in future you had better not let others know you are a Star Lord, or you may well invite assassination."

"Crap!" Yang Kai's face suddenly changed.

Liu Qianyun was taken aback and cried, "What's wrong?"

"My companion!" Yang Kai thought of Ai Ou, also a Star Lord, and his expression darkened.

Ai Ou knew nothing of Star Realm affairs, and he had absorbed a great deal of starlight in the Starlight Passage; if he had arrived in the Star Realm now he would certainly bear obvious stellar radiance.

If Liu Qianyun's words were true, Ai Ou's situation might be perilous.

Liu Qianyun had immediately realized this and considered it for a moment. "When the Starlight Passage shattered everyone was swallowed by spatial rifts; you were powerless—now all you can do is pray he is fortunate on his own. Besides... everything has two sides: although Star Lords are easily coveted, if they meet a person of noble character they may instead be valued."

Seeing Yang Kai look toward her, Liu Qianyun volunteered, "Perhaps your friend will encounter some strong expert who will take him as a disciple. Star Lords from low-level Star Domains are very sought after in the Star Realm; every Star Lord has tremendous potential. Some great Sects even like to recruit people like you and your companion as disciples for focused cultivation."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai was greatly surprised.

"Of course." Liu Qianyun nodded seriously. "There are said to be ten top Emperors in the Star Realm; I heard six of those ten came from low-level Star Domains, and all of them were once Star Lords."

"The ten top Emperors?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened. "Who are they?"

He suddenly thought of Yang Yan and wondered whether she might be among those ten.

Liu Qianyun smiled awkwardly. "I don't know that much. Everything I know I heard from Senior Brother Yin; his Netherworld Sect has a legacy in the Star Realm, so he knows more than we do. Those top Emperors are world-shaking figures beyond our reach... well, Brother Yang may aspire to it; as for me, I would be content to reach a common Emperor level."

Saying that, Liu Qianyun gave a bitter smile.

Yang Kai said, "Don't be modest; cultivation is unpredictable—perhaps one day you'll soar to the heavens."

Liu Qianyun returned his smile. "I'll take your auspicious words to heart."

Yang Kai nodded. Though he worried for Ai Ou deep down, he was helpless and could only hope his companion would notice danger, hide for a while, and after absorbing and fusing the starlight re-emerge; after all, Ai Ou was no fool.

After that conversation the two felt much more at ease; the previously tense atmosphere when they first met had dissipated.

Yang Kai also gained some understanding of Liu Qianyun's character and realized someone like her would not have attacked them without being forced.

Back in the Starlight Passage she must have been helpless; the fault was not hers.

Yang Kai did not rush into seclusion to heal; instead he slowly recovered while chatting idly with Liu Qianyun.

Unfortunately, Liu Qianyun herself did not know much about the Star Realm, so after half a day she had exhausted what she could tell.

Afterwards the two chatted about the situations in their respective Star Domains.

Though it was casual conversation, Yang Kai found that the Great Wilderness Star Domain was not much different from his home Star Domain; in almost every respect the two domains were nearly on par.

The difference was that the Great Wilderness had a man named Yin Lesheng who dominated all, while Yang Kai's homeland had no single overlord but rather a tripartite balance of power.
