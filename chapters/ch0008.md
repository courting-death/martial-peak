## Chapter 8 — Curvaceous Legs, Fair Skin, and Slim Waist?

Half an hour of training had already pushed Yang Kai up one stage. The effect of the Body Tempering Chapter was evident. Though much credit belonged to Yang Kai’s own accumulation of strength, without the Body Tempering Chapter, he believed it would have taken at least three to four more months to advance.

Overcome with emotion, Yang Kai could no longer hold it in and abruptly expelled a breath.

A dense, pitch-black qi, like thick smoke, spewed from his mouth, filthy and foul, rushing straight to the ground and stirring up a swirl of dust. After this breath, Yang Kai immediately felt a lightness throughout his body; all his senses sharpened significantly.

Was this the afterbirth impurities? Yang Kai was shocked.

Each advancement in Body Tempering cultivation expelled impurities from the body. Yang Kai had experienced this before, but never to such an extent.

Countless thoughts and joys swirled in his mind, refusing to dissipate. Though this time’s training instantly advanced him a stage, he had not fully unleashed the Body Tempering Chapter’s true power. Half an hour of practicing the fist and leg techniques had barely unfolded one percent of the Chapter’s routine. If he could perform it all, what results might follow?

But one cannot rush; haste makes waste.

After some deep reflection, Yang Kai formed a rough plan for his future path. Though incomplete, it was far from the step-by-step uncertainty of before. His heart stirred with excitement.

After eating a little, Yang Kai picked up his broom and resumed his duties as the sweeper.

Though a sweeper disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai was not tasked with cleaning the entire Pavilion. He was responsible for merely a tenth of it, so the job was not overly strenuous and usually took about an hour.

Xia Ningshang stood in the treetops, overseeing the day’s disciple activities. She noticed Yang Kai sweeping below and found it strange; he seemed distracted and absent-minded, lingering in one spot for half an hour without leaving, polishing the floor until it shone like glass, so glossy that even a mosquito landing there would risk breaking its leg.

This person... Xia Ningshang could only smile and shake her head.

Yang Kai was indeed preoccupied. Having obtained such a great opportunity yesterday, he naturally needed to consider his future. But after much thought, he found no better way than the half-hour of training before dawn. What else could he do with the rest of his time?

While pondering, a sudden, hurried set of footsteps approached from behind. Yang Kai dodged, but the other person also moved aside. They collided head-on.

Yang Kai was unharmed, only his body wobbling slightly. The other, however, felt as if he had struck a steel plate. He cried out and fell, his limbs numb from the impact.

Yang Kai regained composure and apologized, “Junior Brother, are you alright?”

The man, initially annoyed, saw Yang Kai — the frequent target of beatings every five days — and his anger dissipated. It was meaningless to get mad at someone like him, and besides, this time he was partly at fault.

He quickly waved it off, “I’m fine, I’m fine!”

He got up hurriedly and rushed away.

Yang Kai asked, “Junior Brother, where are you rushing off to?”

Without looking back, the voice came from afar, “To the Contribution Hall, where else?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai suddenly recalled — today was the eighth day of the month. Every month on the eighth, the sect distributed the previous month’s contributions.

So, on this day each month, the sect’s logistics department bustled with activity, especially the Contribution Hall. Countless people flocked there to learn how many Contribution Points they had earned. Those with more contributions would exchange them for miraculous pills, divine weapons, armor, or martial manuals to enhance their strength. Naturally, the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples were excited.

Some rejoiced; others were sorrowful. Yang Kai was among the latter.

He stood stunned, counted on his fingers, and frowned deeply. His contribution from last month was as pitiful as ever.

Sweeping earned ten Contribution Points, but last month he had been challenged six times, losing all six. Each loss deducted one point, leaving him with only four Contribution Points gained.

This... was a bitter pill to swallow.

Fortunately, as a Trial Disciple, the lowest rank in Lingxiao Pavilion, he only lost one point per defeat. An Outer Disciple would lose two points per loss — he would have been in even worse shape.

Relieved by this, Yang Kai felt a bit fortunate.

But even a mosquito is still meat. In his current precarious state, he had to rely on those few Contribution Points to get by this month.

Without hesitation, he resumed sweeping.

By noon, Yang Kai finished his work and carried his broom toward the Contribution Hall.

After a morning lull, the Contribution Hall was nearly empty, quiet and serene. This was why Yang Kai hadn’t come earlier — morning arrivals meant long queues, which were troublesome.

He strolled leisurely into the upper chamber of the Contribution Hall. Indeed, it was quiet inside, with only the elderly shopkeeper dozing behind the counter.

The old man, in his fifties or sixties, had thinning white hair and a kindly appearance, seemingly harmless. But Yang Kai knew better — the man was a formidable expert.

Once, an Elite Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion had acted arrogantly in the Contribution Hall and was flicked out dozens of yards by the old man’s finger, nearly losing his life. Yang Kai was present then, learning of the old man’s formidable power.

Yang Kai approached and saw the old man deep in sleep, snoring loudly, mouth continuously mumbling with a sly, lecherous smile.

That old rascal! Probably dreaming of some female disciple again!

Unfazed, Yang Kai gently tapped the counter with his broom and softly called, “Shopkeeper Meng!”

The old man’s surname was Meng. Yang Kai did not know his full name and had always called him by this title.

The tapping awoke the old man, who opened bleary eyes. Seeing Yang Kai, his face immediately twisted as if he’d seen a pile of excrement.

“What’s with that look?” Yang Kai snapped angrily.

Shopkeeper Meng rolled his eyes, “Why didn’t you come this morning?”

Yang Kai replied confidently, “It was crowded this morning. It’s quiet now.”

“Disturbing an old man’s good dream — do you know what respect for elders and care for the young means?”

Yang Kai leaned in, whispering, “Which girl did you dream of?”

Shopkeeper Meng perked up, about to speak when he caught the mocking disdain in Yang Kai’s eyes. He immediately realized and slammed the counter loudly, “How dare you say that! You’re sullying my good name!”

“Good figure, yes?”

“Yes!” Shopkeeper Meng’s drool nearly ran out.

“Curvaceous legs, fair skin, and a slim waist?”

“Uh-huh, uh-huh...” Meng nodded eagerly, almost regarding Yang Kai as a kindred spirit.

“Heh heh...” Yang Kai sneered silently.

Shopkeeper Meng babbled on, red-faced and embarrassed like a monkey’s behind, wishing he could just crawl into a hole.
