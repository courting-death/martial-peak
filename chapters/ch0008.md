## Chapter 8 — Curvaceous Legs, Fair Complexion, Beautiful Waist?

Ascending one Stage in just half an hour, the effect of the Body Tempering Chapter was already beyond doubt. Although Yang Kai’s own careful accumulation certainly contributed, he believed that without the Body Tempering Chapter, it would have taken him at least three or four more months to advance.

Overcome with excitement, Yang Kai couldn’t hold it in any longer and immediately吐了出来.

A thick, pitch-black aura akin to dense smoke burst forth from Yang Kai’s mouth, filthy and foul, striking the ground and stirring up a swirl of dust. After releasing this breath, Yang Kai felt as if a great weight had lifted. His five senses became much sharper.

Could this be the postnatal impurities? Yang Kai was stunned.

During cultivation in the Body Tempering Realm, every advancement expelled impurities from one’s body. Yang Kai had experienced this before, but never to such an extreme degree.

Countless thoughts and joy swirled in Yang Kai’s mind, refusing to dissipate. Though he had ascended a Stage just now, he had barely unleashed even one percent of the Body Tempering Chapter’s techniques while performing his punches and kicks for half an hour. If even that fraction could yield such results, what would happen if he executed the entire chapter?

But haste makes waste; one cannot rush perfection.

After deep reflection, Yang Kai at last formulated a rough plan for his path ahead. Though incomplete, it was far better than his previous one-step-at-a-time approach, stirring his heart with renewed fervor.

Having eaten a little, Yang Kai took up his broom to continue his duties as a sweeping servant.

Though a sweeping servant of Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai was not responsible for the entire pavilion—just about a tenth of it—so it was not too arduous, usually finished in about an hour.

Xia Ningshang, who stood atop a treetop overseeing the day's activities of Lingxiao Pavilion’s disciples, happened to glance at Yang Kai sweeping below and found it odd. Today he seemed distracted, so much so that he swept one spot for half an hour straight without moving, polishing the ground to a mirror-like shine, as if even a mosquito landing there would sprain its foot.

This fellow... Xia Ningshang couldn’t help but smile wryly.

Yang Kai was indeed deep in thought. Having obtained such a great opportunity yesterday, naturally he was weighing his future carefully. Yet after much contemplation, there was no better plan—only the half-hour before dawn for cultivation left. What should he do with the rest of his time?

While pondering this, hurried footsteps came from behind. Yang Kai quickly dodged, only to find the other person also moving aside, and they collided head-on.

Yang Kai was unscathed, only swaying slightly. The other person felt like he had hit a steel plate, wailing as he fell, numbness spreading where they had collided.

Snapping back to awareness, Yang Kai looked apologetic: “Junior Brother, are you alright?”

The other was initially irritated, but upon seeing Yang Kai—the frequent punching bag beaten badly every five days—his anger quickly faded. There was little point getting mad at such a person, especially since he shared some blame this time.

He waved his hand quickly. “I’m fine, I’m fine!”

Then he got up and hurried away.

Yang Kai asked, “Junior Brother, where are you rushing off to in such a hurry?”

Without turning back, the voice came from afar: “To Contribution Hall. Where else?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai remembered—it was already the eighth day of the month. On the eighth day of every month, the Sect distributed the previous month’s contributions.

So on this day, the Sect’s Logistics Department bustled, especially the Contribution Hall, where crowds flocked to see how much contribution they had earned last month. More contributions meant exchanging them for elixirs, divine weapons and armor, and martial arts manuals to improve one’s strength. Needless to say, Lingxiao Pavilion disciples were often in high spirits this day.

Some rejoiced; others despaired. Yang Kai belonged to the latter.

Frozen in place, Yang Kai calculated and frowned. Last month’s contribution was pitifully meager as usual.

Sweeping earned ten contribution points, but last month he had been challenged six times and lost all six! Each defeat cost one contribution point, so he only ended up with four points.

How could he bear this?

Fortunately, as a Trial Disciple, he was at the lowest rung in Lingxiao Pavilion. Being defeated only deducted one point in contribution. If he were an Outer Disciple, each loss would cost two points, leaving him with a negative balance.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai felt fortunate.

But even a mosquito is meat. He was barely surviving this month and relying on those few contribution points to get by.

Without further hesitation, he resumed sweeping.

By noon, Yang Kai finally finished and swiftly headed to the Contribution Hall.

After the morning’s rush, the Contribution Hall was now quiet and deserted, which was why Yang Kai hadn’t come earlier; the crowds and lines in the morning made it inconvenient.

He strolled into the Contribution Hall’s loft to find it indeed peaceful; only an old man behind the counter was napping.

The old man was the shopkeeper of the Contribution Hall. About fifty or sixty years old, his hair was sparse and white, his expression kind and harmless. To most, he seemed docile, but Yang Kai knew this old man was a formidable master.

Once, an elite disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion had been arrogant in the Contribution Hall and was volleyed out dozens of zhang by the old man’s finger, nearly losing his life. Yang Kai had been present then and only realized the old man’s tremendous power afterward.

Approaching, Yang Kai saw the old man snoring thunderously, his mouth moving as if in a lustful dream, a sleazy smile on his face.

That old devil! No telling which Lingxiao Pavilion female disciple he was dreaming of now!

Yang Kai was used to this and gently tapped the counter with his broom, softly calling, “Shopkeeper Meng!”

The old man’s surname was Meng. Yang Kai did not know his full name and always addressed him this way.

The tapping awoke the old man, who opened bleary eyes. Seeing Yang Kai, his face immediately twisted as if spotting a pile of excrement.

“What’s with that look?” Yang Kai angrily retorted.

Shopkeeper Meng rolled his eyes. “Why didn’t you come this morning?”

Yang Kai replied justifiably, “Too crowded in the morning. It’s just quiet now.”

“You disturbed an old man’s sweet dreams. Do you know the meaning of respecting elders and loving the young?”

Yang Kai leaned in and whispered, “Who was the lady in your dream?”

Shopkeeper Meng perked up immediately, ready to tell Yang Kai with a wink, but seeing the sly, disdainful look in Yang Kai’s eyes, he suddenly realized and smacked the counter loudly, “How dare you! You’re sullying my good name! Absolutely outrageous.”

“She got a good figure, right?”

“Good!” Shopkeeper Meng almost drooled.

“Curvaceous legs, fair complexion, beautiful waist?”

“Mm-hmm, mm-hmm…” Shopkeeper Meng nodded vigorously, almost calling Yang Kai a confidant.

“Heh heh...” Yang Kai smirked coldly without uttering a word.

Shopkeeper Meng stammered on, his face as red as a monkey’s behind, utterly embarrassed, wishing he could vanish into a hole in the ground.
