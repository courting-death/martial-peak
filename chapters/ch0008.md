## Chapter 8 — Curved Front, Rounded Back, Long Legs, Fair Skin, and Slim Waist?

In just half an hour, Yang Kai had already advanced by one stage. The effect of the Body Tempering Chapter was self-evident. Though this owed much to his own long accumulation, he believed that without the Body Tempering Chapter, it would have taken at least three or four months more to achieve such a breakthrough.

Overcome with excitement, Yang Kai could not hold it in and suddenly exhaled.  

A thick, pitch-black qi, like dense smoke, spurted from his mouth, foul and filthy, striking the ground and raising a swirl of dust. With this breath expelled, Yang Kai immediately felt a great lightness; his five senses sharpened considerably.  

Was this the postnatal impurities? Yang Kai was stunned.  

In Body Tempering cultivation, every advancement expelled impurities from the body. Yang Kai had experienced it before, but never to such a degree.  

Countless thoughts and joy surged in his mind. Though he had advanced a stage just now, he had only performed less than one percent of the Body Tempering Chapter’s routine in that half-hour of punches and kicks. If so little could bring such effect, what wonders would unfold if he could complete the entire chapter?  

Impatience can’t eat hot tofu, and panic can’t grab a hot backside.

After pondering deeply, Yang Kai finally formed a rough plan for his path ahead. Though incomplete, it was far better than the step-by-step muddling along of before, and his heart surged with excitement.  

After eating a little, Yang Kai picked up his broom and resumed his duties as a sweeper.  

Though a sweeper in High Heaven Pavilion, Yang Kai was not responsible for the entire sect—just one-tenth of it—so the task was not too strenuous, usually finished in about an hour.  

Perched atop a treetop, Xia Ningshang oversaw the day’s activities of the Pavilion’s disciples. By chance, her gaze fell upon Yang Kai below. She found it strange: today Yang Kai seemed absent-minded, standing in one place and sweeping for half an hour without moving, polishing the ground until it gleamed like a mirror—so much that a mosquito landing there might twist its leg.  

This fellow… Xia Ningshang could only smile helplessly.  

Yang Kai truly was lost in thought. Having obtained such a great opportunity yesterday, he naturally needed to plan for his future. Yet after much contemplation, there was little he could do beyond training for half an hour before dawn. What of the rest of the day?  

As he pondered, hurried footsteps came from behind. Yang Kai quickly sidestepped, but the other also dodged—and the two crashed head-on.  

Yang Kai was unharmed, only swaying slightly. The other felt as though he had struck a steel plate, cried out, and fell to the ground, the spot of impact going numb.  

Recovering, Yang Kai looked at him apologetically. “Junior Brother, are you alright?”  

The other man had been irritated, but upon seeing it was Yang Kai—the one beaten bloody every five days—his anger quickly ebbed. There was little meaning in venting at such a person, especially since he too bore some fault.  

He waved his hand quickly. “I’m fine, I’m fine!” Then he scrambled up and rushed away.  

Yang Kai called after him, “Junior Brother, where are you running off to in such a hurry?”  

Without turning back, a voice came from afar: “To the Contribution Hall! Where else?”  

At this, Yang Kai recalled—it was already the eighth day of the month. On the eighth of each month, the Sect distributed the previous month’s contributions.  

Thus, on this day, the Sect’s Logistics Department was always bustling, especially the Contribution Hall, as countless disciples gathered to see their rewards. More contribution meant exchanging them for pills, weapons, armor, and martial arts manuals to raise their strength. Naturally, disciples of High Heaven Pavilion were filled with anticipation.  

Some rejoiced, others despaired. Yang Kai was among the latter.  

Startled, Yang Kai counted and frowned. As usual, his contribution from last month was pitiful. Sweeping earned him ten points, but he had been challenged six times and lost all six! Each defeat cost him one point, leaving only four in the end.  

How could he bear such misery?  

Fortunately, he was only a Trial Disciple, the lowest rung of the Pavilion. A loss deducted just one point. If he had been an Ordinary Disciple, each defeat would have cost two points, leaving him in debt.  

Thinking of this, Yang Kai felt a bit of relief.  

Still, even a mosquito is meat. Those meager contribution points were his lifeline for this month’s survival.  

Without further delay, he resumed sweeping.  

By noon, Yang Kai finally finished and hurried to the Contribution Hall with broom in hand.  

By then the morning rush had passed, and the hall was nearly empty and quiet—this was why Yang Kai hadn’t gone earlier, as the morning crowds meant long queues and trouble.  

He strolled leisurely into the Contribution Hall’s loft. As expected, it was quiet; only an old man behind the counter was dozing.  

This was the shopkeeper of the Contribution Hall. About fifty or sixty years old, his hair sparse and white, his face kindly and harmless. To most, he seemed harmless, but Yang Kai knew well—this old man was a true master.  

Once, an elite disciple had acted arrogantly inside the Contribution Hall and had been flicked dozens of zhang away by this old man’s finger, nearly losing his life. Yang Kai had witnessed it then and understood the old man’s unfathomable strength.  

Yang Kai approached and found him snoring thunderously, mouth smacking as if savoring a dream, a lewd smile spreading across his face.  

That old rascal! No doubt dreaming of some female disciple again!  

Yang Kai was unfazed, gently tapping the counter with his broom and softly calling, “Shopkeeper Meng!”  

The old man’s surname was Meng. Yang Kai did not know his full name and always addressed him this way.  

The tapping disturbed his dream. He opened bleary eyes, and upon seeing Yang Kai, his face twisted at once as if beholding a pile of dung.  

“What’s with that look?” Yang Kai snapped.  

Shopkeeper Meng rolled his eyes. “Why didn’t you come this morning?”  

Yang Kai retorted, “Too crowded in the morning. It’s quiet now.”  

“You disturbed this old man’s sweet dream. Do you even know what it means to respect your elders and cherish the young?”  

Yang Kai leaned closer and whispered, “Which girl were you dreaming of?”  

Shopkeeper Meng immediately brightened, ready to gossip with a smirk. But catching the sly disdain in Yang Kai’s eyes, he suddenly realized and slammed the counter with a bang. “How dare you! Sullying my good name—outrageous!”  

“Good figure, right?”  

“Good!” Shopkeeper Meng nearly drooled.  

“Curved front, rounded back, long legs, fair skin, slim waist?”  

“Mm, mm, mm…” Meng nodded vigorously, almost calling Yang Kai a confidant.  

“Heh heh…” Yang Kai sneered coldly without another word.  

Shopkeeper Meng stammered, his face as red as a monkey’s backside, utterly embarrassed, wishing he could sink into the floor.
