## Chapter 1043 — Kills Both Men and Women

Yang Kai's Divine Sense darted like a needle and lightning, weaving and lingering within the Star Chart that hovered above his Sea of Consciousness.

Soon, following Xue Tong's introduction, he located a cultivation star as large as a silver plate; at this moment its seas and lands each occupied about half its surface, and its volume was comparable to the Hengluo Commerce Guild's homeworld — Shuiyue Star.

This was Rainfall Star!

Around Rainfall Star orbited a far larger Sun Star, and several much smaller Moon Stars; under the pull of gravity the moon-stars circled Rainfall Star while Rainfall Star in turn revolved around that Sun Star — independent yet bound together by countless subtle links.

The star domain here was inscrutably profound; the patterns of motion concealed the great Dao's laws and held a maddening fascination for observers.

Sun Stars and Moon Stars were two kinds of celestial bodies always found near a cultivation star: the Sun Star emitted sunlight to nourish the plants and living things on the cultivation star, while the Moon Star shed a holy radiance, its cold moonlight bathing minds in tranquility.

After locating Rainfall Star, Yang Kai began to apply his understanding of the Star Domain to sketch various safe travel routes.

He was soon surprised to discover that using his consciousness as a brush and his Divine Sense as ink to draw routes on the Star Chart actually enhanced his understanding and application of Divine Sense power.

This unexpected discovery filled him with ecstatic delight.

He threw himself into simulating one Star Chart after another, imprinting each chart marked with safe routes into his Star Shuttle.

He was completely absorbed and gradually lost all sense of time, sunk into this extremely abstruse realm.

Sketching and imprinting Star Charts consumed vast amounts of Divine Sense power; Yang Kai immersed himself for many days, producing countless maps of safe passages from one cultivation star to another. Some routes spanned such vast distances that even by warship they would take years, while others connected two neighboring cultivation stars, requiring no more than a few months round trip.

His comprehension of star domains deepened, and his grasp and use of the Divine Sense Fire grew increasingly instinctive, producing from within a sensation of the soul being purified and uplifted.

Yet he could not tell how effective the charts he had drawn would truly be — whether navigating the star domain according to his charts would indeed be completely safe, free from any danger.

Such matters required practice to verify; only then could one arrive at a definite answer.

He resumed scrutinizing the warship's planned course and compared it against the Star Charts he had sketched.

He found the safe charts he had worked out matched the ship's route exactly; he was elated and felt invigorated, his confidence soaring.

He began to scan the route ahead, wanting to see if any danger lay in wait.

Almost immediately his observation revealed several troubling signs.

If the warship continued for another day or two it would enter a frigid, lifeless sector of the star domain — a vast region dense with meteors, an ocean formed from a mass of rocks, the surrounding stars dim and dead, utterly devoid of Spiritual Qi.

All those stars were dead worlds.

He relayed his findings to Xue Tong via the compass.

Xue Tong replied quickly: "Young Master, don't worry — that place is the famously ice-cold Dead Domain; we will indeed pass through it."

"Really?" Yang Kai asked, unconvinced.

"Really. Every warship traveling from Rainfall Star to Shuiyue Star goes through there. Nothing has ever happened before." Xue Tong seemed to find Yang Kai's concern a bit excessive and chuckled.

After a pause he asked in surprise, "Young Master, how did you know we'd pass through the ice-cold Dead Domain?"

From what he knew of Yang Kai, it was impossible for him to be versed in such matters, which made Xue Tong click his tongue in amazement.

Yang Kai did not explain; he severed the connection and returned to concentrating on drawing Star Charts and refining his use of Divine Sense power.

In another cabin, luxurious to the extreme, Xue Yue sat in a comfortable chair, relaxed, a goblet between his fingers filled with wine as red as fresh blood; he sipped elegantly, listening to the Origin Returning Realm elder's report.

"Young Master, I've inspected everything thoroughly. The cargo aboard the warship is exactly what Blazing Flame ordered; I found nothing that should not be permitted for transport."

"Nothing missing?" Xue Yue asked softly.

"Nothing! I even captured one person and probed his memories; found nothing amiss."

"Oh?" A thoughtful expression crossed Xue Yue's face; his hand, more delicate and fair than a woman's, idly toyed with his hair as a faint frown creased his brow.

The casual movement, though unintended, struck another attendant standing nearby like a thunderbolt; his body trembled and he stared at Xue Yue with a worshipful look, his breath growing heavy, his gaze lascivious and red, like a famished wolf eyeing a sumptuous feast.

A clear surge of power issued from him, as if he would cast aside everything, regardless of gender, to throw himself upon Xue Yue.

"Young Master!" The Origin Returning Realm expert instantly perceived the danger and barked a warning.

"Hm?" Xue Yue snapped back to himself, saw the other's lecherous behavior, and a hint of disgust flashed in his deep, clear eyes. He said to the attendant, "Get out!"

That Saint King Third-Stage cultivator finally came to his senses; his face flushed crimson in an instant, and he wished he could crawl into a hole. After offering a quick apology, he fled in utter shame, rushing out the door.

After the man departed the elder gave a wry smile. "Young Master, you must be more careful. The fault wasn't entirely his."

Xue Yue snorted lightly. "Weak willpower like that — if there is trouble next time, don't let him come near me."

"Understood." The elder nodded and sighed inwardly.

If not for his deep cultivation and age, the elder would likely have been ensnared by the aura Xue Yue unintentionally emitted; it confirmed the rumors — this prodigious Young Master really could kill both men and women!

What he usually displayed was only an attraction for women.

But the charm he revealed unconsciously could also enthrall men, making them lose all self-control.

If such a man were to mature further, who could possibly withstand his allure?

"No problem with the cargo… so what exactly is Xin Rui hiding?" A faint smile touched Xue Yue's features before he added, "Never mind — I'm too lazy to waste my mind on it. You may withdraw."

"Yes!" The elder respectfully retreated.

……

The warship's speed suddenly slackened as it prepared to thread through the ice-cold Dead Domain, dodging the erratic meteors; that was why it had not maintained its previous pace.

Soon the enchanting scenery outside vanished; darkness and cold replaced it, bleak and empty. The warship seemed to have entered a purgatorial abyss.

Occasional lights flashed past like afterimages and vanished swiftly.

The enormous warship ploughed steadily through the seas of meteors, seemingly unimpeded.

This route was not truly deadly, merely bumpy; ships of the Commerce Guild had passed here countless times and no accident had ever occurred.

Thus the cultivators aboard felt reassured and let down their guards.

But as the warship's commander and leader, Xin Rui watched the surroundings constantly, never daring to relax for an instant.

He knew that any unexpected event might cause unforeseen losses.

Two days later the warship again entered a meteorite sea; Xin Rui steered carefully, guiding the ship through the rocks to avoid collisions.

As they pushed into the meteor-wrapped zone, he suddenly felt a chill crawl over his body — an unpleasant sensation, as if a breath of death had rushed toward them.

He had last felt such a premonition many years ago when hunted by an Origin Returning Realm cultivator; it was precisely that unusual instinct that had saved his life.

He trusted his instincts.

Xin Rui peered through the window to see if some danger approached.

There, in the pitch-black cold domain, a white light began to bloom.

The dazzling white pierced the gloom like a blade and set off a chain reaction; quickly some twenty white lights flared around the warship, scattering like fireflies on the nearby meteors.

Xin Rui's pupils shrank and he barked, "Full speed — get out of here! It's a Fragmented Star Flash; someone set a trap!"

His roar echoed through the warship and the cultivators in the engine room turned pale; in an instant they pushed the ship to maximum thrust, desperate to flee.

But it was too late. The white lights, as they blossomed, emitted subtle energy fluctuations; before Xin Rui's words had fully fallen, the lights flared into searing brilliance like suns, their rays piercing the depths of the starry sky and illuminating the cold Dead Domain until every corner shone with blinding light.

Terrifying energy ripples radiated from each pinpoint of white; circles of visible waves surged outward. Twenty-some lights, twenty-some ripples, layered and colliding endlessly, bringing a despairing air of death.

The space of the ice-cold Dead Domain warped instantly, fragments collapsing and scattering; countless meteors were ground to dust, utterly annihilated — wherever the ripples passed, all turned to nothingness.

The Saint King-Grade Upper-Level warship had only just accelerated when it was engulfed by the ripples.

The warship’s hull—normally sturdy enough to traverse the Star Domain—shattered like fragile tofu, crumbling into dust like the surrounding meteorites, exposing everything within.

Each cultivator from the Hengluo Commerce Guild turned deathly pale, their faces twisted in utter horror. Their eyes brimmed with both the terror of death and an unwillingness to let go of life.

Where the ripples passed, people of all cultivations exploded into blood mist, leaving no bones behind!
