## Chapter 1784 — Provoked into Madness

His father was the master of Purple Star, one of the most powerful forces in the entire Star Domain; when he stamped his foot the whole Star Domain would tremble three times. And yet he actually softened toward a young man who had previously provoked and insulted him? Zi Donglai could hardly believe his ears and privately thought the world had gone utterly mad.

"Shut up!" Zi Long glanced at him coldly, his authority absolute; when their gazes met Zi Donglai immediately dared not make another sound.

"Is this supposed to be an apology?" Yang Kai grinned.

Zi Long frowned and said mildly, "If you say it's an apology, then so be it."

"Hmm... since it's an apology, I'll reluctantly accept it."

Reluctantly accept...

Zi Donglai was so furious he almost spat blood!

To have the master of Purple Star apologize of his own accord — this brat not only failed to show gratitude, but even said he would 'reluctantly accept' it? Did he not know what an honor that was? That bastard... utterly unforgivable!

"But... what do you want to do?" Yang Kai ignored the look Zi Donglai shot him and instead smiled at Zi Long, asking with meaning.

Saying 'sorry' was nothing more than a few moving lips and cost nothing, so Yang Kai didn't take Zi Long's words to heart; instead, it was the other's attitude that made him quietly wary.

He did not believe Zi Long couldn't see the heart-demon he'd planted in Zi Donglai earlier; he did not believe Zi Long was truly so magnanimous as to care nothing for the earlier provocation and insult.

The master of Purple Star truly had a frightful depth of scheming!

"I do not wish to do anything to you; I only... want to ask if you are interested in joining our Purple Star?" Zi Long looked at Yang Kai solemnly and issued the invitation.

"Join Purple Star?" Yang Kai chuckled.

"That's right. Although your cultivation does not reach the Void King Realm, from your performance just now I can give you the status of an Honored Guest Elder!"

"An Honored Guest Elder!" Zi Donglai could no longer contain himself and let out a low exclamation.

An Honored Guest Elder of Purple Star was nothing like an Honored Guest Elder of an ordinary sect or family—it was a symbol of true strength, a mark of status!

At present Purple Star had only seven Honored Guest Elders, each a Void King Realm expert, and historically Purple Star's Honored Guest Elders had always been Void King Realm — there had never been a precedent of someone below Void King Realm becoming an Honored Guest Elder.

But now the master of Purple Star was personally inviting and attempting to win over a martial artist at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm to join Purple Star, and promising such a status.

If news of this spread, the entire Star Domain would likely be shaken.

“An Honored Guest Elder, hmm…” Yang Kai chuckled lightly, showing not the slightest hint of interest. Shaking his head, he said, “No need. I’ve always preferred my freedom and dislike being bound by rules. So I’ll pass on this Honored Guest Elder position.”

Was this man an idiot? Zi Donglai looked at Yang Kai as if at a fool — did he not understand how weighty those words were? To refuse so casually without a second thought?

Zi Donglai's mind churned incessantly.

"An Honored Guest Elder is not bound by my Purple Star; entirely free. Young friend, you seem to have misunderstood my proposal..." Zi Long patiently explained.

Yang Kai cut him off, "No need to explain, I know what an Honored Guest Elder is. It's just... I don't want to join any force."

Zi Long's eyes narrowed and a faint smile crossed his face, "Young friend, won't you reconsider?"

"You are so long-winded." Yang Kai sneered at him, showing him no face.

Zi Long's expression immediately turned grave.

"Ha, kid, you're right to refuse!" Xu Wei chortled at the side. "Do not believe his honeyed words; if you truly agreed, you'd have trouble later. But your temper really suits this old man — how about considering joining the Abandoned Nest? You've offended this fellow; it'll be hard to get by in the Star Domain later, but my Abandoned Nest is not afraid of Purple Star — I, this old man, will vouch for you. With your ability and temperament, you'll surely carve out a place in the Nest!"

"You're long-winded too!" Yang Kai turned to Xu Wei and sneered, "Two old foxes. You think I don't know what you're scheming? Trying to stall for time, huh?"

At this, Xu Wei and Zi Long both changed expression slightly — Yang Kai had clearly seen through their intent.

Although Xu Wei and Zi Long were enemies, seeing Yang Kai so close at hand caused them both to sense danger; both were deeply scheming and needed no consultation to know how to stall for time and wait for the Seven Luminaries Divine Light to fade.

After Yang Kai exposed them, Zi Long's face grew ugly and he said coldly, "Kid, being too clever isn't a good thing. Don't think mastering a bit of spatial power lets you escape my palm. You are only at the Origin Returning Realm; you do not understand the terror of the Void King Realm, and I am a very strong presence even within the Void King Realm. If you plan to rely on your spatial power, you'd be gravely mistaken. I will give you one chance now: pluck a Wudao Flower and hand it to me, and I will spare your life!"

He had thoroughly torn off the pretence with Yang Kai.

"Hahaha!" Yang Kai laughed, "What's so remarkable about the Void King Realm? I've killed more than one Void King Realm myself."

"Arrogant!" Zi Donglai snapped from the side.

Even a genius capable of fighting above his rank, at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, could not pose any real threat to a Void King Realm; conversely, others could easily kill him.

There was an unbridgeable chasm between the Origin Returning Realm and the Void King Realm!

So instinctively he thought Yang Kai was talking nonsense.

But he did not know that Yang Kai had really killed more than one Void King Realm, and had even killed a Second Stage of the Void King Realm — albeit by borrowing the power of the Star Emperor Token — yet that was still experience.

If Zi Donglai knew, he would surely be ashamed.

"Enough, I'm not bothering with you anymore." Yang Kai turned away, a little listless; although he had been bickering with Xu Wei and Zi Long, in his mind he was calculating the time until the Seven Luminaries Divine Light withdrew.

There was still one incense stick of time left; plenty of time!

“Wow, what a rich medicinal fragrance!” Yang Kai exclaimed exaggeratedly, then took a deep breath of the aroma wafting from the five Wudao Flowers before him. His face showed an expression of bliss, as if teetering between life and death. “Mm, worthy indeed of being Wudao Flowers—the Dao essence within is truly extraordinary. I can feel my bottleneck loosening already… oh dear, whatever shall I do?”

As he spoke he scratched his head, looking quite distressed.

He fussed and fawned after gaining the advantage, and Zi Donglai watched with reddened eyes.

Just by inhaling the medicinal scent, the bottleneck loosened?

Yang Kai’s cultivation was the same as his—at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, just a hair’s breadth away from stepping into the Void King Realm. And now… without a doubt, Yang Kai had seized that very chance.

Meanwhile Zi Donglai could only hide more than one hundred zhang away, watching helplessly.

This tormented Zi Donglai body and soul — he wanted to rush forward and take the chance himself; his fists clenched so hard they made cracking sounds.

"No, no — breaking through in this damned place is a death sentence. Quickly suppress the fluctuating qi; wait until it's safe to breakthrough later!" Yang Kai shouted again.

Zi Donglai was truly about to vomit blood.

The opportunity he had longed for sat before Yang Kai, yet Yang Kai forcibly suppressed it — could anything be more crushing?

Zi Donglai felt that meeting Yang Kai in the Lost Realm was the worst nightmare of his life! He had been utterly devastated by Yang Kai...

"Kid, enough!" Zi Long saw his son's expression and could not help but angrily shout at Yang Kai.

"Hehe..." Yang Kai glanced at him sideways, rubbed his hands like a lecher who had found a naked beauty, saliva almost dripping — an utterly unsightly image — then reached toward one of the Wudao Flowers.

With a light tug Yang Kai plucked that Wudao Flower clean from its root, not damaging the root at all.

By reason, such heaven-and-earth treasures should be harvested by pinching them off at the stem, so as to gain the greatest benefit without eradicating the root—allowing the Wudao Flower to retain a thread of life. After several thousand years, it might even bloom once more.

Alchemists always did this when collecting medicinal materials.

But Yang Kai thought that even if he left the Wudao Flower a thread of life, it would only end up benefiting Zi Long and Xu Wei in the end. So he acted decisively, leaving no chance for those two old foxes to take advantage of it.

"Ah, so this is the legendary Wudao Flower — not bad, not bad. It has nine petals and is pale purple; it looks at least three thousand years old in medicinal age. This will make me rich; when I ascend to the Void King Realm I won't lack good materials. Even if I don't use it myself, I can trade it for something — I'm sure many will want it." Yang Kai said this as he took a jade box from his Spatial Ring, opened it, and carefully placed the Wudao Flower inside.

His movements were leisurely and the entire process was watched clearly by Zi Long and Xu Wei.

For some reason the two Void King Realm experts both felt as if their hearts were bleeding.

That bastard was definitely doing it on purpose!

Xu Wei and Zi Long both had the same thought and their hatred for Yang Kai intensified.

It was like a starving man, days without food or drink, suddenly seeing a table of delicacies before him — yet he could not eat any of it and had to endure the torture of the person at the table eating and commenting on how delicious each dish was.

Yang Kai was undoubtedly the one sitting at the table gorging himself while endlessly chattering about how good everything tasted...

"Second one, hehe..." Yang Kai said, plucking another Wudao Flower and placing it in his jade box.

The movement was identical to before, slow to the point of outrage!

Zi Long drew a deep breath and closed his eyes.

He no longer wanted to watch; out of sight, out of mind.
