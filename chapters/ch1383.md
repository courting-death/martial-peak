## Chapter 1383 — Conditions

"Mm." Hearing his elder's question, Deng Ning nodded helplessly.

"Oh?" The Origin Returning Realm martial artist's face brightened. "If you already know him, that makes things easier. Deng Ning, explain it carefully to this young brother — Elder Jin Shi needs that piece of Xuan Gold; see if he can part with it."

This Demon Blood Sect disciple was, unexpectedly, the same Deng Ning Yang Kai had met before. When Yang Kai had left Flowing Flame Sandland, he had run into Deng Ning being pursued by two sect brothers and had lent him a hand; it was from Deng Ning that Yang Kai had obtained the Demon Blood Threads secret art. That technique was tremendously powerful and had helped Yang Kai more than once.

Later, Deng Ning repaid the favor: he escorted Yang Kai into Demon Blood City and, through connections, arranged use of the city’s Space Array so Yang Kai could be transported to another town and then return to Tianyun City.

On that basis alone, Yang Kai's impression of Deng Ning was favorable. Although Deng Ning’s origin — the Demon Blood Sect — was not reputable, there was no problem with private interaction.

He had not expected Deng Ning to come near Tianyun City this time, nor that he would be sent to shadow him along with other Demon Blood Sect members. Yang Kai knew Deng Ning had no choice and held no grudge.

Besides, their friendship was shallow; there was nothing worth taking to heart.

Deng Ning replied and looked helplessly at Yang Kai. Before he could speak, Yang Kai raised a hand and said, "Brother Deng, no need to say more. Since the Xuan Gold is in my possession, there is absolutely no way I will hand it over. I'm afraid you'll be disappointed; please leave."

The Origin Returning Realm martial artist from the Demon Blood Sect's expression darkened. Just as he was about to retort, a burly man from Myriad Beasts Mountain began to laugh. "Young man, don't be so absolute. Hear what terms Myriad Beasts Mountain proposes before making a decision. Though we don't compare to the Leitai Sect or the Battle Sky Alliance, we are still a frontline sect and won't let you be shortchanged. No one refuses a good offer."

His words were casual, but there was an implicit threat.

The Demon Blood Sect's Origin Returning Realm man sneered, "You speak boldly. What terms can you offer? If you had the capital, why did you back down at the auction?"

The burly man from Myriad Beasts Mountain snorted and ignored him, staring at Yang Kai. His lips moved as he transmitted his Divine Sense: "Young man, it seems you lack no Saint Crystals; otherwise you wouldn't have bid so high at the auction. But you know what Myriad Beasts Mountain does. I'll give you thirty Seventh-Tier demonic beasts and ten Eighth-Tier demonic beasts, and teach you the method of beast-taming, if you hand that Xuan Gold over to me. Your little mountain headland is small; with these beasts guarding it, it will be as solid as iron. I can't promise much more, but common thieves certainly won't dare meddle. How about it?"

Frankly, the price wasn't low, but it still couldn't match the amount of Saint Crystals Yang Kai had paid. After all, a Seventh-Tier demonic beast was roughly equivalent to a Saint Realm martial artist, and an Eighth-Tier only equaled a Saint King Realm.

Myriad Beasts Mountain clearly hoped to get a bargain, and Dragon Lair Mountain already had layers of arrays protecting it; what use were those beasts?

Even if the offer showed some sincerity, Yang Kai shook his head decisively.

The Myriad Beasts Mountain man frowned and transmitted again, "I'll add five more Eighth-Tier demonic beasts — that's the highest Myriad Beasts Mountain can offer. Think carefully before you answer!"

"I said it already: once the Xuan Gold is in my hands, I will not hand it over. Please leave," Yang Kai said coolly.

"You ungrateful brat! Don't pick and choose—I'll level your little mountain headland right now!" The burly man flew into a rage; Yang Kai’s shameless attitude infuriated him.

Hearing the threat, Yang Kai grinned. "Fine. I'll be watching to see how you level my Dragon Lair Mountain!"

"You seek death!" The burly man's eyes flashed with killing intent, but then he glanced sideways and noticed the Demon Blood Sect people watching eagerly, as if they wanted him to start a fight with the youth.

His heart chilled. He knew if he acted rashly he'd only benefit the Demon Blood Sect, so he suppressed his anger, smirked, and stood aside as if enjoying the show.

He wouldn't let the Demon Blood Sect take the Xuan Gold either — otherwise he couldn't account for it to Elder Feng.

Moreover, this was near Tianyun City; he wouldn't dare casually kill someone. If not for that, Old Woman Feng and Jin Shi would have personally come to see Yang Kai.

Because this was territory near Tianyun City, they didn't want the reputation of a powerful bullying the weak. That was why the two Third Stage Origin Returning Realm experts had dispatched disciples to negotiate with Yang Kai in hopes he would be sensible and hand over the Xuan Gold.

The Demon Blood Sect's Origin Returning Realm man, seeing the Myriad Beasts Mountain people looking at him, did not hold back. He declared, "I don't know what terms this Myriad Beasts Mountain friend offered, but my Demon Blood Sect is willing to provide twenty pristine blood-slaves. Young man, what do you think of that proposal?"

He said it confidently, looking at Yang Kai as if expecting no refusal.

The Myriad Beasts Mountain members changed expression; the burly man inhaled sharply. "Twenty pristine blood-slaves! Your sect spends lavishly!"

After saying it, he looked toward Yang Kai with anxious emotion, fearing he would accept. After all, the temptation of twenty pristine blood-slaves was enormous; ordinary people could hardly refuse.

If the Demon Blood Sect were willing to offer him such benefits, he would immediately defect from Myriad Beasts Mountain and pledge himself to the Demon Blood Sect.

"Ha! Compared to Elder Jin Shi's divine skill, twenty blood-slaves are nothing," the Demon Blood Sect's leader smiled faintly and said to Yang Kai, "Blood-slaves are cultivated continuously; only our Demon Blood Sect on Dark Star can produce them. With certain rituals, they will obey you absolutely until death — utterly loyal. Each blood-slave's yuan-yin energy can also aid a martial artist's qi and blood strength."

Saying this, he glanced at a woman behind him, an evil smile spreading across his face. "This is one of my blood-slaves."

Then he issued a command that stunned the crowd: "Take off your clothes!"

The woman hesitated at the order; her expression turned pale and her body trembled.

The woman's brows and eyes were like a painting, her waist lithe and graceful; she radiated a seductive charm — perhaps the result of some allure technique — with a disarming coquettishness lingering at the corners of her eyes.

Her cultivation wasn't low either — First Stage of the Saint King Realm — yet upon that man's command she actually began to undress in public, before everyone.

Biting her thin lip, her face white and obviously unwilling, she could not disobey his order.

Clothes rustled as the Myriad Beasts Mountain male disciples watched dumbfounded, swallowing hard, while the few female disciples displayed disdain and scorn.

One garment after another was removed until only undergarments covered her vital parts. Her skin was snow-white, like mutton fat jade, gleaming temptingly and driving men's thoughts wild. That hint of exposure was devastating to any man, quickening the blood in their veins.

Seeing she was about to remove even that undergarment, Yang Kai frowned in displeasure and said in a deep voice, "I'll say it one last time: I will not hand over the Xuan Gold. Stop testing me."

The Demon Blood Sect's Origin Returning Realm man's face shifted; he stared at Yang Kai and said in a low voice, "Young man, are you truly so resolute, with no room for compromise?"

Yang Kai looked at him indifferently and was too lazy to speak further.

"Hmph. Fine. Young man, your ambition may reach the heavens; I hope your life isn't as thin as paper!" The man sneered, spat that vicious phrase, and sensibly chose not to fight Yang Kai here, waving his hand as he led the Demon Blood Sect away.

Before they left, the blood-slave bowed her head to Yang Kai in a slight nod, showing a trace of gratitude. She snatched up her clothes from the ground and vanished with a sway of her body.

Deng Ning clasped his fists toward Yang Kai with an apologetic face and retreated with his elder.

The Demon Blood Sect departed. The burly leader of Myriad Beasts Mountain chuckled, "Young man, think it over carefully. If you change your mind, come to Tianyun City to find me; the terms I offered can be redeemed at any time."

He wore a friendly expression as if their earlier unpleasantness had been nothing more than a misunderstanding.

With that, he too led his people away.

The conflict dissipated, but Yang Kai frowned. Recently he had made more and more enemies, but this was unavoidable; the Xuan Gold was of great use, and he would not hand it over lightly.

Dragon Lair Mountain lay near Tianyun City and was under the protection of Yingyue Hall. Though Yingyue Hall wouldn't intervene in the Xie Family's affairs, if Myriad Beasts Mountain or the Demon Blood Sect attacked Dragon Lair Mountain, Yingyue Hall certainly would not stand idly by.

Those two powers could be left alone for the moment; it was the Xie Family that required consideration.

Yang Kai had planned to settle things with the Xie Family after his last breakthrough, but now that he learned Lu Ye was also with the Xie Family and people from the Haixin Sect had gone there too, it would be difficult to act hastily.

Dragon Lair Mountain's defenses were unquestionably solid, but its offensive strength was somewhat lacking. This matter must be handled over time. Yang Kai was wary of Lu Ye; the mere fact that the man could restore a severed arm was enough to make one cautious. Until Lu Ye's background was uncovered, rash action would be unwise.

With that in mind, Yang Kai turned and entered the mountain-guarding array.

Yang Yan was waiting ahead; she hadn't gone to rest. Seeing him return safely, she wasn't surprised and simply waved, heading toward the stone residence.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and followed at an easy pace.

Inside the stone residence they sat face to face. Yang Yan reached out and said, "Let me see that Star Emperor Token."
