## Chapter 2591 — Submit or Face Extinction

“What the hell!” The Yao King was shocked. When had he ever seen such a bizarre secret technique? Startled, he tried to retreat, but the Incarnation only grinned wickedly and slapped at him.

Unfortunately, there was still a gap in strength. He could only watch helplessly as the Yao King broke free from the Domain and fled to the side.

Just then, the Saint Envoy’s attack arrived.

“Don’t worry about me!” Yang Kai suddenly shouted. The Incarnation, who was about to lend a hand, stopped as soon as he heard this.

Whoosh...

A flash of light, and suddenly a small, ancient bell appeared in Yang Kai’s hand. The bell was mottled with age, but carved with clear patterns of flowers, birds, beasts, mountains, and rivers.

Yang Kai gently tapped the bell, Emperor Yuan surged, and the bell instantly grew to the height of a person, blocking the way ahead.

Roar...

The phantom of a colorful giant tiger lunged at Yang Kai, biting down right onto the bell.

Clang...

The bell’s sound shook the heavens. Ripples spread out from Yang Kai, containing mysterious power. All living beings who heard the bell—whether the thirty-plus Yao Kings or the Stone Spirits—were all frozen in place, feeling an inexplicable suppression.

The colorful giant tiger was directly shattered, dissolving into specks of light and vanishing.

Puff...

The burly Saint Envoy spat out a mouthful of old blood, his spirit suddenly wilting.

That giant tiger phantom was the power of his own Inner Core, a full-force attack. After being shattered by the Mountain and River Bell, he suffered a backlash.

“Mountain and River Bell!” The burly Saint Envoy clutched his chest, staggering backward. His eye twitched violently, his mind dazed, unable to believe what he was seeing.

“Mountain and River Bell?”

“Impossible!”

“Wasn’t this thing stolen tens of thousands of years ago? How could it appear here again?”

The yao were stunned, and the Saint Envoys kept exclaiming, each with shock in their eyes.

There was no helping it—the Mountain and River Bell’s reputation was simply too great. It had spread from the Wild Ancient Land, and as creatures living in the wildlands, no one understood its terror better than they did.

Looking around, the giant bell blocking the human’s path was exactly like the legendary Primordial Era treasure. Combined with the suppressive power just now, what else could it be but the Mountain and River Bell?

Instantly, the gazes of the many Yao Kings grew wary.

An ordinary First Stage Emperor Realm human might not be worth their attention, but if he possessed the Mountain and River Bell and could wield its power at will, that was a different matter.

No one was willing, nor had the courage, to test the bell’s terrifying might.

With the bell in hand, Yang Kai sent a chill through the hearts of every Yao King and Saint Envoy present. None dared to act rashly, each wary of provoking the Mountain and River Bell’s dreadful power.

Yang Kai raised the Mountain and River Bell high and shouted, “Follow me!”

The Stone Spirits reacted, and while the Yao Kings were still dazed, they rushed to Yang Kai’s side, gathering around him.

“Anyone who blocks me dies!” Yang Kai held the Myriad Sword in one hand and the Mountain and River Bell in the other, shouting fiercely as he picked a direction and dashed forward.

In that direction, several Yao Kings stared in shock. Seeing Yang Kai leading a group of Stone Spirits charging over, they were startled.

Before they could clear the way, Yang Kai raised the Myriad Sword and struck the Mountain and River Bell hard.

Clang...

The deep bell sound gathered into a visible shockwave, sweeping toward the blocking Yao Kings. Wherever it passed, space was suppressed.

The Yao Kings’ faces changed, cursing loudly. Not daring to hesitate, they scattered to the sides, barely avoiding the shockwave.

As soon as they retreated, Yang Kai led the Stone Spirits right through their midst, arrogant as if no one could stop them.

Every Yao King looked grim, and the eight Saint Envoys’ expressions were extremely cold.

Nearly all the top combat power of the Ancient Land’s yao was gathered here, yet a single human was rampaging through them. If word got out, how could they preserve their dignity?

But with Yang Kai’s murderous aura, none dared to be the first to challenge him. Who knew what would happen if the Mountain and River Bell struck? Didn’t they see the burly Saint Envoy’s miserable, blood-spitting state? That was just a backlash—if hit head-on, nothing would be left.

The yao all had different thoughts, so Yang Kai easily led the Stone Spirit Race out of the encirclement, about to escape.

Just then, Yang Kai, charging ahead, suddenly narrowed his eyes, staring in a certain direction.

The Stone Spirits following him instinctively sensed a chill rising in their hearts.

Buzz...

Heaven and earth suddenly trembled. At the horizon, several small black dots appeared.

In the blink of an eye, those dots flew close. Four terrifying auras descended from the sky, converging in one place, like ten thousand mountains pressing down. Yang Kai’s chest felt heavy, almost unable to breathe.

“Divine Spirits!” Yang Kai’s eyes widened in fury, staring at the four figures that appeared, his face as ugly as could be.

He knew these four Divine Spirits were already on their way back, but he only needed a little more time to collect the Stone Spirit Race into the Small Xuan Realm. Then he could use space techniques to escape.

However, in front of the four Divine Spirits, even a little time was a luxury.

Yang Kai’s body suddenly halted, and the Stone Spirit Race stopped as well, their eyes full of despair.

They knew that with the Four Great Saint Venerables present, there was no escape today.

The Elder gave a dry smile: “Young Brother, my Stone Spirit Race has implicated you.”

If not for him and Mu Na insisting Yang Kai bring them to the Blood Gate, how could today’s disaster have happened? The Elder was full of guilt.

“It’s not the end yet, Elder. You’re speaking too soon.” Yang Kai shook his head, lips pressed tight, his gaze sweeping over the four Divine Spirits.

He hadn’t been in the Ancient Land long, but he’d long heard of the Four Great Divine Spirits—they were the overlords of the Wild Ancient Land!

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, Cang Gou, Shi Huo...

Yang Kai looked at their faces, the names flashing through his mind.

“Hmm?” Luan Feng suddenly narrowed her beautiful eyes, looking at Yang Kai in surprise. “Little friend, have we met somewhere before?”

Little friend...

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, but in front of such an ancient and powerful being, he supposed she was qualified to call him “little friend.”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly: “Over ten years ago, outside Fenglin City at Yuqing Mountain, I was lucky enough to glimpse your greatness. You probably don’t remember.”

He was referring to the time he and Liu Qianyun escaped Biyu Sect and headed to Fenglin City. That time, a Luan Feng cub appeared at Yuqing Mountain, attracting many martial artists to search and hunt. Luan Feng herself arrived, unleashing the World-Ending Black Flame, burning countless martial artists and leaving Yuqing Mountain ablaze ever since.

That was his first time seeing a living Divine Spirit. Back then, Luan Feng was in her true form; now she had taken human shape. But there was only one Divine Spirit Luan Feng in the world, so Yang Kai knew this beautiful woman was the giant he’d seen years ago.

Luan Feng’s eyes flashed, seeming to recall, and she nodded slightly.

“Madam Feng, you know him?” Fan Wu asked calmly.

Luan Feng smiled: “Just a brief meeting. I didn’t expect him to grow so much in just over ten years. He must have great talent—given time, he’ll surely become a powerful figure.”

“Hmph!” Cang Gou sneered, staring at Yang Kai. “Only those who survive can be called powerful.”

“The Mountain and River Bell is his? Looks like he’s had some lucky encounters.” Fan Wu’s face was cold as he stared at the bell in Yang Kai’s hand.

The four Saint Venerables had been lured away by the bell, and were annoyed. Now, knowing the bell belonged to Yang Kai, they were even less pleased, feeling he’d played them.

“Boy, how do you want to die!” Shi Huo suddenly stepped forward, his oppressive aura surging. Even with the bell’s protection, Yang Kai felt unbearable pressure.

Today’s events would not end peacefully. Yang Kai’s mouth was bitter.

The Stone Spirit Elder rumbled: “Lord Shi Huo, this young friend was brought here by me. Today’s events have nothing to do with him. If you let him go, my Stone Spirit Race will accept any punishment.”

Shi Huo sneered: “Isn’t it a bit late to say you’ll accept punishment? For years, I’ve tried to subdue you, but you always refused. Now, at the end of the road, you beg me? Do you think I’ll agree?”

The Elder’s expression was dry; he didn’t know what to say. The Stone Spirits were never good with words.

Shi Huo shouted: “Today, your Stone Spirit Race either submits to us or is wiped out. As for this boy... daring to play tricks on me, not even the Heavenly King can save him!”

“Play tricks? What do you mean?” The Elder was confused, clearly unaware that Yang Kai had used the bell to lure them away.

The Saint Venerables had dominated the Ancient Land for years, but today a human had used the Bell to play them. If the human were strong, it’d be fine, but he was only a First Stage Emperor.

Shi Huo didn’t bother explaining. With his status, he didn’t need to. He said arrogantly, “Extinction or submission, Elder, you choose. Time is short—I’ll give you ten breaths!”

The Elder said solemnly, “As I said, if you let this young friend go, my Stone Spirit Race will submit!”

“That’s not up to you. You’re not qualified to bargain with me!” Shi Huo waved his hand impatiently.

The Elder glanced at the other three Saint Venerables, his voice hoarse. “Do the rest of you share this view as well?”
