## Chapter 2091 — Coercion

The Origin Qi within the seven Dao Origin Realm experts roiled and surged, pouring out like the waters of a breached dam; it flowed away so swiftly that every face changed.

Qin Chaoyang barked, "Don't panic. This formation appears like this before it's fully formed — all of you must unite and work together!"

At his words, everyone hastily calmed themselves and resumed tracing the spirit seals.

The Origin Qi, like a tide, became visible to the eye, gradually converging together and fusing; after a moment, a shape of a colossal, hideous thing suddenly congealed.

It had a dragon head, a tortoise back, and a snake tail — majestic and imperious; it was the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise.

A terrifying pressure suddenly spread out; its strength made even the seven who had formed the array startle.

At this moment, the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise, formed from the seven people's Origin Qi, looked lifelike; its head turned and its tail swayed as if it were alive, though far smaller than a true Black Tortoise — even so, it remained gigantic.

Among the seven, Duan Yuanshan occupied the dragon-head position; four others were dispersed at the limbs; the middle-aged man surnamed Fu took the snake-tail position; Yang Kai was placed squarely in the center, with Qin Yu at his side.

Such an arrangement had, of course, been deliberately chosen by Qin Chaoyang.

He had placed Yang Kai in the exact center specifically so he could guard Qin Yu.

Looking out, the seven Dao Origin Realm experts now seemed to be sheltered within a translucent body of the Black Tortoise Divine Spirit.

And when this Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation was completed, the Origin Qi that had been continuously flowing out from the seven finally slowed, becoming extremely sluggish.

The seven showed expressions of delight. They did not rush to act; instead, they all closed their eyes and silently sensed the wondrous subtleties of this unparalleled formation.

Demonic Qi rolled in from all directions, enveloping the seven and soon engulfing the translucent Black Tortoise silhouette. Countless fiends attacked from every side, using the cover of Demonic Qi to launch wave after wave of assaults.

The Black Tortoise figure vanished from sight.

On the city wall, countless gazes brimmed with worry as they watched anxiously, afraid these seven Dao Origin Realm experts would perish there.

Suddenly, a low roar rose from the place where the Demonic Qi swirled — a sound like a dragon’s cry and a beast’s howl that shook heaven and earth.

With the roar came an explosive burst of power that seemed capable of destroying heaven and earth.

The Demonic Qi that had encircled that area was immediately cleared away, and the innumerable fiends that had leapt forward were hurled back, rolling and exploding into clouds of blood mist while in midair.

The Divine Spirit’s phantom reappeared, and the eight people sheltered within the phantom were completely unharmed.

Duan Yuanshan laughed heartily, “With such an extraordinary array assisting us, what great task can we not accomplish? Move out!”

Having briefly experienced the subtleties of the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation, his confidence swelled.

With that, he led the charge forward, the others following closely behind, maintaining the operation of the array with their distances kept precise.

Along the way, whenever a fiend tried to bar their path, the Divine Spirit’s phantom would swing a palm larger than a door — with a single sweep no fiend could withstand it; they were all flung aside, reduced to nothing but a bloody smear.

Fenglin City was not far from that mine; it was only two thousand li away, but if anyone of the seven Dao Origin Realm experts tried to fly there alone from here, only a few might reach it safely.

Yet now, aided by the array’s might, the seven’s Origin Qi became one to form the Divine Spirit’s silhouette; they swept on like a hurricane, irresistible.

That highly corrosive Demonic Qi could not affect them in the slightest and was repeatedly repelled away from them.

It was the countless, boundless fiends that delayed their advance.

“This formation is truly splendid.” The group advanced with no difficulty. Hua Qingsi, positioned at the right forelimb of the Black Tortoise phantom, suddenly pursed her lips in a smile; her lovely eyes glanced to the left as she said, “I wonder whether Sir Qin has any intention of selling it? If you do, I could—”

"Madam Hua, no need for more words. This formation was completed at the cost of my ancestor’s heart and soul, the latter half of his life devoted to it; I will not sell it." Qin Chaoyang cut her off with a dark face before she could finish.

“Sir Qin, do not be so decisive. What in this world does not have a price? After this is over, I shall find a chance to speak with you privately.” Hua Qingsi smiled, clearly not prepared to give up. As she spoke her eyes shimmered like flowing water; even Qin Chaoyang, old and frail, felt his chest flutter and his blood heat up, his throat dry.

He silently cursed her as a vixen, hurriedly steadied his mind, drew in a deep breath, and forced down the surging qi and blood in his chest.

“This Lord is also very interested in the formation; count me in.” The middle-aged man surnamed Fu suddenly interjected, his tone brooking no argument.

“Sir, that is rather unreasonable.” Hua Qingsi was clearly displeased and spat, “I was the one who first mentioned this to Sir Qin; if you are interested, should you not wait for me to finish speaking with him?”

“Must everything be ordered by who came first?” The man surnamed Fu glanced at Hua Qingsi with a sneer, scoffing, “Do you think this is buying buns from a market?”

Hua Qingsi’s lovely eyes narrowed slightly, a faint smile still on her face as she said, “Sir, are you really going to be so brazen as to bully a lone weak woman like me?”

Fu’s brows lifted as he gave a cold snort. “So you disagree?”

The two exchanged barbed words and the encounter had already sparked friction.

Duan Yuanshan shouted from the front, “You two, the immediate priority is to repair that damaged seal; other matters can wait. Could you grant me a little face and stop arguing for now?”

Hua Qingsi pursed her lips and smiled, falling silent.

The man surnamed Fu remained arrogant and coldly said, “This Lord does what he pleases; why should you interfere? Believe it or not, I will leave this array now and ensure you never return.”

At that, not only did Duan Yuanshan’s face change, but Qin Chaoyang, Zhuang Pan, and Du Lishen all went pale.

The Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation required all seven to cooperate; if Fu truly abandoned them now, with his powerful cultivation at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he might fight his way out, but the others would not have that capability.

At minimum, those who were only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm had no confidence in resisting the corrosive Demonic Qi for long; before long they might be transformed into fiends.

Although Qin Yu could serve as a substitute, she was only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — how could she coordinate with the others to form the array? If that were attempted, within a few breaths her internal strength would be drained.

It could be said that if Fu truly abandoned them, at least half of the remaining people would die.

“Sir, you need not be like this.” Zhuang Pan’s face went white; he had not come willingly but at Duan Yuanshan’s summons. His strength was inferior to the Drunken Old Man’s; Duan Yuanshan needed the Drunken Old Man to remain in Fenglin City after he left, so he had brought Zhuang Pan along. Seeing Fu so arrogant, Zhuang Pan felt panic and bitterness and scolded Duan Yuanshan for misjudging people and finding such a fool, utterly lacking in moral restraint — it inflamed him.

“Yes, Sir, you need not act rashly.” Du Lishen also tried to dissuade him, “We can discuss things properly.”

As he spoke he shot a fierce look at Qin Chaoyang, signaling him to think of a solution.

Yang Kai said nothing, only looking at Duan Yuanshan with some surprise.

Since Fu had come from the City Lord’s mansion, Yang Kai had assumed he must have some connection with Duan Yuanshan, that they were acquainted, but now it was clearly not so.

Fu had never held Duan Yuanshan in any regard.

Or rather, he held no one in regard; he carried an air of supreme self-importance.

Yang Kai guessed silently that this fellow came from a powerful background; only someone of distinguished origin would be so arrogant.

“Discuss? This Lord never discusses anything with others.” Fu sneered at Qin Chaoyang and said, “Old man, will you sell this Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation or not? Give me an answer!”

He bore the look of a man who would storm off the moment he failed to get a satisfactory answer, a stance that both enraged and terrified the others; all eyes turned to Qin Chaoyang, each face pleading desperately.

“Sir, how could you act so?” Qin Chaoyang looked incredulous and aggrieved.

Duan Yuanshan also trembled with anger, clenching his fists.

Not because the man had disrespected the City Lord, but because he had struck when they were down; had he known this man bore such treacherous ambition, he would never have allowed him to join the array.

If the timing had been better, Duan Yuanshan would have immediately turned on Fu.

“This Lord has poor patience. One last time: are you selling or not?” Fu pressed, leaving Qin Chaoyang no room to breathe.

“Old Qin…” Du Lishen was panicked, looking at Qin Chaoyang with pleading eyes.

“Brother Qin, think of the bigger picture.” Zhuang Pan also urged, then added, “We do not mind either way, but without the array’s protection, your Yu’er—”

He wore an expression of concern for Qin Yu, as if he were genuinely worried for her.

Qin Chaoyang’s face swam with indignation and reluctance; after all, he had offered the Qin Family’s heirloom formation himself and personally taken the field, bringing his precious granddaughter Qin Yu into danger to ease Fenglin City’s crisis — he did not expect his zeal to be so heartlessly doused.

How could he be willing to hand that formation over?

“Fine, the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation — I will sell it to Brother Fu.” After a moment of contemplation Qin Chaoyang saw no other choice, gritted his teeth and said in a low voice.

“Ha! A man who knows when to seize an opportunity is a hero!” Fu laughed loudly. “Old man, you are quite something.”
