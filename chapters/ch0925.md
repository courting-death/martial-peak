## Chapter 925 — Courtesy Before Force

"Saint Lord, is there some important matter for this summons?" In the main hall, Li Rong asked while sizing up the two Hu sisters, an odd gleam appearing in her beautiful eyes.

With her strength she could tell that although the sisters' power wasn't high, the cultivation method they practiced was unusually strange. Even twins shouldn't have their life traces and energy fluctuations be utterly indistinguishable.

The Saint Realm experts all noticed the curious phenomenon and gave the Hu sisters a few extra glances.

"I'm going out for a while," Yang Kai said as his gaze swept over everyone. "Li Rong and Han Fei, come with me."

The two leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan acknowledged him.

"Also, I need an elder familiar with the route to guide us," Yang Kai said calmly, turning his gaze to the six elders. "Which one of you knows the way to the Xiaoyao Divine Cult?"

"I know it," Shi Kun stepped forward.

"Then Elder Shi Kun will accompany me; the others remain in the Sacred Land."

"Saint Lord, is there some dispute with that Xiaoyao Divine Cult?" Xu Hui asked with a frown; Yang Kai's expression looked off and his tone was different from usual, which made him sense something amiss.

"No dispute yet, but there might be, so I need to bring several experts over."

"Then I also—"

"Great Elder, don't go," Yang Kai interrupted before he could finish. "Someone must stay to guard the Sacred Land; you remaining will make handling affairs here easier."

Xu Hui thought it over and agreed with Yang Kai, so he did not insist.

"Little Senior Sister, you stay as well," Yang Kai looked to Xia Ningshang. "Shopkeeper Meng might return soon."

"Mm, I won't go. I'll stay here to refine pills and wait for Master," Xia Ningshang said obediently, nodding.

"We want to go!" the Hu sisters said in unison.

Yang Kai glanced at them, sensing the resolve in their expressions, and nodded slightly.

Only then did Hu Jiao'er and Hu Mei'er break into smiles.

"No time to waste, let's leave at once." Yang Kai waved his hand and, without delay, led the way out.

Outside the Saint Lord's courtyard, Yang Kai briefly instructed the remaining leaders and elders, then summoned the Flying Shuttle. Once the six boarded, it transformed into a streak of cyan light and vanished in an instant.

The Flying Shuttle was about three zhang long; carrying seven or eight people was no problem, and because it possessed a defensive barrier, no headwind could be felt regardless of speed.

Still, Yang Kai distinctly felt that carrying so many people caused his own energy expenditure to increase exponentially.

Shi Kun stood at the front, guiding direction and route, while the other five sat behind.

Along the way, Yang Kai briefly recounted the Hu sisters' background and the reason for going to the Xiaoyao Divine Cult; only then did Li Rong and Han Fei understand why he was being so cautious.

That place was where Yang Kai had grown up, so he naturally felt differently about it. Now that all the Small Xuan Realm entrances had opened and the Xiaoyao Divine Cult could enter Zhongdu's world, whether they'd use their strength to bully others was uncertain; if they relied on their power and disregarded Zhongdu's warriors, they might oppress or enslave them.

His friends and family were there—how could he allow such a thing to happen?

During the flight, Shi Kun kept glancing back from time to time, his expression odd.

"Elder Shi Kun, is there something you want to say?" Yang Kai asked when he saw him hesitating.

Shi Kun smiled. "It's nothing much, only that the two young ladies' auras are extremely similar."

"Oh, that's because they practice a special cultivation technique."

"I see," Shi Kun scratched his head. "If not for the Saint Lord saying so, I'd have thought you came from the Twin Pavilion."

"Twin Pavilion?" Yang Kai frowned, vaguely recalling the name of that force.

Last time at the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, when Sun Yu emerged from Dragon Valley, his master Ling Jian had said he should take refuge in the Twin Pavilion for a while, and mentioned that the Dragon-Phoenix Palace and the Twin Pavilion had always been on good terms.

"Elder, why did you think we were from the Twin Pavilion?" Hu Jiao'er asked loudly.

"Because the Twin Pavilion mostly takes twins as disciples," Shi Kun explained with a smile. "This force is peculiar—every disciple it accepts are twins without exception. Though their numbers are not large, because of their special cultivation method, a pair of sisters or brothers fighting together can often surpass their rank. When cultivated to the extreme, their life aura and internal energy fluctuations become alike—though not as completely as you two. You two are basically indistinguishable. When I was young doing my trials outside, I once met a pair of brothers from the Twin Pavilion, so I know a bit about them; that's why I assumed you hailed from there."

"We haven't heard of it," Hu Jiao'er smiled and shook her head. The sisters had been on the road for months and were unaware of information in this region.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened slightly; after a moment's thought he asked, "Elder Shi Kun, was the Twin Pavilion powerful in the past?"

"Not exactly powerful; although there are Saint Realm experts within the pavilion, they don't seem particularly strong... Oh right, those two brothers did say that long, long ago the Twin Pavilion was indeed an extraordinary sect, but for some unknown reason its lineage was severed and it gradually declined. They spoke with certainty—who knows if it's true."

"Lineage severed?" Hu Jiao'er exclaimed, light gleaming in her eyes—she had clearly thought of something.

A plan formed in Yang Kai's mind; he could be fairly certain that the Hu sisters' Consonant Spirit Technique came from the Twin Pavilion.

Their situation was similar to his and Su Yan's—both had inherited teachings from long ago.

Explained this way, the Dragon-Phoenix Palace's longstanding friendship with the Twin Pavilion made sense. Both sects had once been top powers long ago; when their lineages were broken and they declined, they would naturally feel like two fellow exiles.

"When there's a chance, I'd like to visit the Twin Pavilion," Hu Jiao'er murmured; she was clearly curious.

"After we resolve the Zhongdu matter, I'll take you there," Yang Kai said.

"Mm." Hu Jiao'er nodded, then leaned in and whispered in Yang Kai's ear like a soft breeze, "By the way, Yang Kai, what cultivation levels are the people you brought? Why can't I sense how deep they are?"

"Saint Realm."

"Saint Realm?" The Hu sisters looked at him in astonishment.

"Above the Transcendent Realm is the Saint Realm," Li Rong interjected with a smile. "You two are currently First Stage of the Transcendent Realm—mm, nearly at Second Stage. Above that is Third Stage, and then the Saint Realm. It seems the world the Saint Lord comes from has no Saint Realm experts."

"Don't mention it. Ten years ago they didn't even know the name Transcendent Realm; they only called it 'beyond the Divine Roaming Realm,'" Yang Kai said, somewhat embarrassed.

"Then above the Saint Realm?" Hu Mei'er widened her beautiful eyes and asked, full of curiosity.

"Above the Saint Realm?" Li Rong and Yang Kai exchanged a glance and slowly shook their heads. Li Rong smiled, "That is unknown—no one has reached beyond the Saint Realm."

The Hu sisters fell silent together.

The existence of the Saint Realm seemed to have struck them; they were slowly digesting what they'd heard and trying to acclimate themselves to this world.

On Zhongdu's side, when the two fought together they had been almost invincible, but arriving here they were horrified to find many experts they could not possibly contend with.

This shift in their conception of strength had a massive impact on their perception.

They had to reassess themselves and began to examine the Tongxuan Continent.

For most of the flight the group remained silent; Yang Kai took the opportunity to ask Shi Kun in detail about the Xiaoyao Divine Cult.

Two days later the Flying Shuttle came to a sudden halt in midair; Yang Kai expanded his divine sense and carefully scouted the surroundings.

Hu Jiao'er suddenly cried out, "I remember this town below—we only traveled two days from there to arrive here."

"Then which way do we go now?" Yang Kai asked.

Hu Jiao'er examined it carefully and pointed with a delicate finger, "This way!"

The cyan light flashed again.

After the time it takes for a stick of incense to burn, Yang Kai saw in the distance an entrance to a Void Passage opening some ten zhang above the ground. Near the entrance many warriors stood on guard, forming a strict array, watching the surroundings; should anyone approach they would immediately drive them away.

"This is the place," Hu Mei'er hissed through clenched red lips. "My sister and I came through here."

Yang Kai nodded lightly, guided the Flying Shuttle down, and the six strode toward the entrance.

"Saint Lord, five Saint Realm experts are stationed here, but all are only First Stage—nothing to fear," Li Rong's divine sense spread out and instantly discerned the number and cultivation of the local experts.

"It seems not only the Xiaoyao Divine Cult is involved," Shi Kun mused. "They appear to have found some allies—at least three factions seem to be mixed in."

Yang Kai nodded. "Zhongdu is a big prize; one sect alone cannot take it."

"What do we do?" Li Rong asked softly.

"Courtesy before force!" Yang Kai said in a low voice.

The arrival of the six clearly drew the attention of the nearby warriors; a host of gazes focused on them, all assessing Yang Kai and his company.

Among the scattered warriors, five concealed a sharp light in their eyes and their power quietly gathered, ready to strike at any moment.

One of them hesitated, then slowly stepped forward to stand before Yang Kai and the others. Raising a hand, he loudly declared, "Halt. This Small Xuan Realm was discovered by our Xiaoyao Divine Cult; please investigate elsewhere."

Since all the Small Xuan Realm entrances had opened recently, almost every force and warrior was exploring in hopes of finding opportunities.

The sect that discovered an entrance first would often dispatch disciples to guard it, preventing outsiders from approaching.

A powerful force naturally wants to monopolize the benefits of the Small Xuan Realm, and the Xiaoyao Divine Cult has that capability.
