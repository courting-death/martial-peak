## Chapter 518 — Killing at the Door

While Yang Zhao was scolding Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng, a furious shout suddenly rang out: “Xiang Chu, Nan Sheng, your days are numbered!”

The voice was not loud, but it was crystal clear, reaching everyone's ears without any distortion.

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng, already ashamed and furious at themselves, heard those words and their expressions instantly changed dramatically, panic overwhelming them.

Yang Zhao’s face grew strange as he cast a sidelong glance at Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng, chuckling coldly, “What does this mean? Why has Ninth Brother come here?”

Nan Sheng kept silent, unwilling to speak.

Xiang Chu gritted his teeth and said with difficulty, “It seems Yang Kai has pursued us all the way…”

“Nonsense!” Yang Zhao clenched his teeth and growled, “Of course I know he’s chasing after you! Why is he doing this? Are you hiding something from me?”

Earlier, when recounting the battle with Yang Kai, Xiang Chu did not reveal anything about Lingxiao Pavilion and the others, fearing Yang Zhao would overthink.

But now that Yang Kai had arrived at the estate's gate, Xiang Chu immediately realized there was no way to conceal the matter.

“Tell me, what exactly did you do to anger him so deeply?” Yang Zhao took a deep breath, trying to moderate his tone.

“It’s the Lingxiao Pavilion people... Eldest Brother Nan injured one of their disciples.”

“Lingxiao Pavilion? Ninth Brother’s sect?” Yang Zhao frowned and pressed on, “It’s more complicated than that, isn’t it?”

“Second Young Master, please calm down...” Xiang Chu’s brow knitted tightly; with no other choice, he laid out the entire matter plainly.

After hearing this, Yang Zhao nodded lightly. “Enemies will use any means necessary; by that measure, you haven’t done wrong.”

Xiang Chu brightened upon hearing this, thinking Yang Zhao had no intention of pursuing their responsibility. Yet just as a smile began to bloom, Yang Zhao’s expression turned cold again, and with chilling eyes, he said, “If you have the ability to withstand Ninth Brother’s retaliation, I would applaud your actions! But do you? If not, then you’re just a pair of stupid pigs blinded by hatred.”

Xiang Chu shrank into silence as if frozen by cold.

Nan Sheng looked up and said, “Let’s put aside right or wrong for now. Yang Kai is making such a ruckus outside the estate. If Second Young Master ignores it, people will look down on you.”

“Trying to provoke me?” Yang Zhao laughed. “Nan Sheng, you underestimate me too much. No wonder you and Xiang Chu suffered such losses at Ninth Brother’s hands.”

Nan Sheng trembled and replied, “I meant no such thing, Second Young Master, please forgive me.”

Yang Zhao cast a cold glance at him and said, “But you’re right. Ninth Brother openly provokes and causes trouble outside my estate in broad daylight — I cannot just ignore it.”

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng were overjoyed upon hearing this and quickly said, “Thank you, Second Young Master!”

“No need,” Yang Zhao slowly shook his head, calm yet firm. “This time I will protect you because you are still my allies. After today, return to your own clans. War City doesn’t need you; the Yang Family’s Succession War doesn’t need you either!”

He snorted coldly, turned, picked up his clothes, and strode outside.

Behind him, Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu’s faces went pale, their spirits crushed. They hadn’t expected Yang Zhao to intend to cast them out over this matter.

The Xiang and Nan families held considerable influence, and in this Succession War had early on attached themselves to the great tree that was Yang Zhao. Over this long period, they had weathered wind and rain, endured trials great and small, and fought shoulder to shoulder with him.

They had invested a lot into the Succession War: manpower, resources, wealth, and more.

Now, just as the Succession War was nearing its end, they were being expelled by their own master.

If this became public, the two great families would surely become a laughingstock. After investing so much, to gain no advantage is one thing, but the damage to their family’s honor would be dire.

They had made enemies of Yang Kai and failed to gain Yang Zhao’s protection or favor. It would become unrealistic to hope for ties with the Yang Family again.

Other forces in the world might also shun them because of this, making their family’s development extremely difficult.

It was also quite possible that because of this, the heirs to their families would be stripped of their statuses.

Thinking of this, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng broke out in cold sweat, trembling all over.

Their eyes filled with hatred and malice, biting their teeth and clenching their fists.

If not for Yang Kai... if not for Yang Kai, how could they have fallen to such a pitiful state?

“Two young masters...” a coquettish voice suddenly came from beside them. Lost in thought, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng looked up and saw Ye Xinrou smiling coyly, holding a quilt in front of her chest. Two fragrant shoulders were exposed, shimmering with porcelain-like temptation.

Normally, they would have burned this beautiful scene into their memories, but at this moment, they had no mood for such pleasures.

Ye Xinrou giggled without caring about her exposed skin, pulled the quilt tighter, revealing just a hint of springtime radiance, and softly said, “You two are standing there; it’s hard for me to get dressed. Could you please move aside? Besides, Second Young Master has already left. Aren’t you going to follow him?”

At these words, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng seemed to awaken from a dream. They rushed outside, though Yang Zhao said he would protect them this time, who could be sure he meant it?

After they left, Ye Xinrou pursed her lips in dissatisfaction. “Not even closing the door behind them, how careless.”

Yet her expression grew excited, cheeks reddened as she murmured, “This Yang Kai is interesting. He even dared to mess with Kang Zhan—he’s quite bold…”

Though she had met Yang Kai a few times, she had never spoken to this youngest Yang Family young master and did not know his temper. But today’s episode had given her some insight. She was quietly watching, wondering who would win the Succession War—Second Young Master Yang Zhao or Yang Kai.

Outside Yang Zhao’s estate, Yang Kai stood alone, a murderous aura piercing the sky as he silently stood there. His vast Divine Sense enveloped the entire estate, penetrating every corner.

More and more people rushed toward Yang Zhao’s estate, slowly gathering. These were individuals drawn by Yang Kai’s voice, all unaware of what had happened.

Within War City, a tempest suddenly stirred.

Several hundred zhang away, in a teahouse near a window, Yang Wei, whose appearance was concealed, squinted towards Yang Kai across the distance, his expression shifting in astonishment. He noticed that although Yang Kai appeared calm, an overwhelming killing intent locked stubbornly on a particular spot in Yang Zhao’s estate. His face was resolute—a stance of "not defeating this target means not giving up"—uncompromising to the extreme.

“What is Ninth Brother trying to do?” Yang Wei was stunned. War City had been unusually calm for over two months, with everyone striving to grow stronger for suppressing enemies. Ninth Brother’s sudden drastic action baffled him.

Yet he felt faintly that he had missed some good spectacle.

There must have been a conflict between Ninth Brother and Second Brother that he was unaware of, or Ninth Brother wouldn’t cause such a ruckus in broad daylight.

A streak of blood light tore through the sky, carrying unparalleled ferocious and malevolent aura. Yang Wei’s breathing faltered as he focused on the blood light.

Moments later, the blood light landed beside Yang Kai—it was the demonic master who had appeared at Yang Kai’s estate more than two months ago.

“Young Master!” Di Mo appeared, positioning himself near Yang Kai, alert to all around.

Yang Kai merely nodded slightly; he had expected this.

“What is this person’s background?” Yang Wei pondered deeply but could not grasp the origins of Di Mo.

Out of the corner of his eye, he suddenly spotted a familiar figure calmly sitting on the chair across from him.

Turning his head, he was shocked to see Liu Qingyao of the Liu Family!

Yang Wei nodded slightly and poured him a cup of tea.

“That person’s true background, no one knows,” Liu Qingyao suddenly said. “He seems to have appeared out of thin air. All we know is that over half a year ago, he was active in Cangyun Evil Land and killed many people.”

“Oh?” Yang Wei raised an eyebrow, “So he is from the Evil Land?”

“Not really. Cangyun Evil Land is under the command of six great evil kings, but there is no such person among them.” Liu Qingyao shook his head. Because of Di Mo’s earthshaking skills two months ago, Liu Qingyao paid close attention to him. He used the Liu Family’s power to investigate for a long time but gained no leads.

“However, it seems he shows great respect to Ninth Brother. Such a powerful person is so obedient in front of Ninth Brother?” Yang Wei inhaled lightly, puzzled to no end.

Ninth Brother was a master just one step away from Divine Roaming. Even among the Zhongdu Eight Great Families, there were not many like him. Though these men’s status might be below those beyond Divine Roaming, the difference was small. Upon promotion, they would command enormous respect and attention.

“Setting him aside, your Ninth Brother isn’t to be underestimated either.” Liu Qingyao’s expression turned serious as he gazed far away, fixing his eyes on Yang Kai.

Yang Wei looked at him and suddenly laughed, “Never thought Young Master Liu would praise someone like this. If Ninth Brother knew, he would certainly take pride.”

Liu Qingyao shook his head. “I don’t have the qualification to judge him. His future accomplishments will surpass mine.”

“He already surpasses you now!” Yang Wei said, smiling with deep meaning.

Yang Kai’s Qi and Blood were extremely vigorous. Although he was only at the Ninth Stage of the True Yuan Realm, even across such a distance, Yang Wei could still feel a tremendous pressure emanating from Yang Kai.

He estimated if he fought Yang Kai now, he would be defeated within ten breaths.

Even if Liu Qingyao was stronger than him, he was no match for Ninth Brother.

Yang Wei could see this clearly, and Liu Qingyao could as well. Complex expressions appeared on Liu’s face. He didn’t argue but nodded: “If this continues, he will sooner or later fall to the demonic path. No matter how strong or talented he is, it won’t help. His True Yuan is suffused with too much malevolent aura; this is something he cannot suppress.”

Hearing this, Yang Wei’s expression darkened. He knew Liu Qingyao was not exaggerating and was filled with doubt, wondering how Yang Kai had ended up like this.

Could it be that during these two months, Ninth Brother was cultivating some evil technique? Yang Wei silently speculated.
