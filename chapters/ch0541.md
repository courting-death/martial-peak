## Chapter 541 — Truly Despise You

The public opinion surged like a tide, spreading fiercely. In less than half a day, the news had already traveled throughout the entire War City and Zhongdu. Everyone was abuzz with discussion. Those who had once held great hopes for Yang Kai had unwittingly begun to change their attitudes.

Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen, who were forced to leave, had also become the center of public attention. Rumor had it that these two young masters had seen through Yang Kai’s evil nature and, after futile attempts to persuade him, had turned against him.

If this were not the case, they would never have left Yang Kai’s estate under any circumstances.

The news caused an uproar across the city. The efforts Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen had invested over such a long time seemed wasted, and rage towards Yang Kai’s actions and attitude ran deep.

At the Yang Wei estate.

Since Yang Kai’s advancement to the Divine Roaming Realm, no further moves had been made at Yang Wei’s estate. All the martial artists under his banner were focused solely on cultivation, paying no mind to the Succession War. Even Eldest Young Master Yang Wei himself lacked confidence in winning; what could these subordinate warriors do?

It was more important to improve their own strength quickly and leave the War City once the Succession War concluded.

The usually quiet estate was undisturbed by any sound, until suddenly, the silence was shattered by hurried footsteps approaching from afar. The footsteps grew louder, quickly reaching Yang Wei’s room. Without knocking, the visitor dashed inside, urgently calling out, “Eldest Young Master! Eldest Young Master!”

Yang Wei, who was meditating, slowly opened his eyes. Looking at the visitor, Meng Shanyi, whose face was a mix of shock and excitement, Yang Wei raised his sword-like brows and said sternly, “Shanyi, how many times have I told you not to panic like this? You always act like this when something happens.”

He shook his head slowly, a trace of helplessness clouding his expression.

“Eldest Young Master, this is different,” Meng Shanyi said, complexion flushed as if he had received tremendous good news, yet a complex sorrow lingered in his brows.

“What exactly is it?” Yang Wei had been secluded recently, completely cut off from outside news, and was unaware of the city’s public opinion.

Meng Shanyi said, “Yang Kai is about to be eliminated.”

Yang Wei’s expression instantly sharpened. He coldly asked, “Where did you hear such rumors?”

“They’re not rumors,” Meng Shanyi shook his head gravely and proceeded to summarize the events of the day in the city.

Yang Wei’s demeanor turned strange after hearing it.

The departure of Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen from Yang Kai’s estate was beyond his expectation.

The fierce public outcry in War City made it clear someone was stirring the waters behind the scenes. The identity of those people needed no guessing; only the Zhongdu Eight Great Families possessed such power to manipulate public opinion.

He had not imagined that his Ninth Brother, who possessed unparalleled ability, would attract such serious attention from the Eight Great Families.

An uneasy feeling crept deep within him...

Even if Ninth Brother had the potential to become an Evil Lord, the Eight Great Families would never openly harass a younger generation. Why was this happening? What greater meaning lay behind it?

Moreover, they first manipulated the tide of public opinion, putting Ninth Brother in a passive position in terms of righteousness. Then...

Yang Wei seemed to recall something alarming, his face suddenly paling.

“Eldest Young Master, there’s one more thing,” Meng Shanyi said hesitantly, frowning.

“What is it?”

“The Meng Family sent word, ordering us to cooperate with Second Young Master... to defeat Yang Kai,” Meng Shanyi said bitterly.

“The Meng Family sent a message?” Yang Wei raised an eyebrow. “What about the Yang Family?”

“The messenger said the Yang Family would not intervene in this matter, so we could act boldly.”

Meng Shanyi had received the message during his own seclusion and had hastily gathered intelligence within the War City before coming to inform Yang Wei.

“Cooperate with the Second Young Master... haha,” Yang Wei suddenly smiled bitterly. “Even if everyone from our two estates combined forces, we probably couldn’t defeat Ninth Brother. Are there other plans?”

Meng Shanyi smiled wryly. “Eldest Young Master is insightful. The messenger said we need not worry, just show an appearance and make a statement. The rest will be handled by Second Young Master’s estate.”

Yang Wei fell silent, his eyes gleaming with sharp light.

“Eldest Young Master,” Meng Shanyi pressed, “Although the message came from the Meng Family, it seems your Yang Family tacitly approved.”

Yang Wei nodded lightly. Without the Yang Family’s approval, Meng Family wouldn’t dare act this way.

“Since that day, the Second Young Master has lost all fighting spirit, and his estate’s forces have tremendously shrunk. He can’t possibly be the Third Young Master’s match,” Meng Shanyi’s expression grew gloomy, “But from the tone of the messenger, the Second Young Master is now confident in absorbing Yang Kai’s estate... How does he have such assurance?”

“Reinforcements—reinforcements from the Eight Great Families,” Yang Wei said bluntly.

Meng Shanyi was shocked. Yang Wei had said aloud the very suspicion he had been harboring. His expression turned bitter. “Eldest Young Master... does this mean the Second Young Master has already been chosen as the next Yang Family head?”

The reinforcements bypass the Eldest Young Master’s estate and head directly to Yang Zhao’s estate. That alone was telling.

The Yang Family clearly hoped Yang Zhao would inherit the headship. Therefore, reinforcements gathered there, enabling him to defeat Yang Kai and win the Succession War.

Yang Wei smiled faintly and nodded. “Setting aside Ninth Brother’s case, judging by the current situation, the Yang Family indeed desires this.”

“Don’t you feel any heartbreak?” Meng Shanyi couldn’t help but ask.

The Succession War had reached a point where Yang Kai appeared to be the clear victor, and the most tragic figure was undoubtedly Yang Zhao. After suffering a heavy blow, Yang Zhao had lost all will to fight. How was such a person fit to lead the Yang Family?

By temperament alone, Yang Wei was more suitable.

Why then were reinforcements sent to Yang Zhao’s estate?

Yang Wei shook his head with a smile. “Why should I grieve? To be honest, I don’t want to be the head of the Yang Family. I suspect Ninth Brother feels the same.”

“How?” Meng Shanyi was stunned. Yang Kai’s performance in the Succession War was overwhelmingly fierce, showing unshakable determination.

“Ninth Brother and I both want to reach the pinnacle of martial Dao. Those with great ambition rarely desire the headship. The position may seem illustrious, but it is filled with trivial affairs, leaving no time for cultivation. From what I know, Ninth Brother joined the Succession War mainly to restore the reputation of his sect, Lingxiao Pavilion. It seems he reached an agreement with the family head: if he wins, Lingxiao Pavilion will be cleared of the label of Evil Sect and regain its former glory.”

“Only for that reason?” Meng Shanyi was dumbfounded. He could not fathom anyone indifferent to power.

“Exactly,” Yang Wei nodded. “I’m participating in the Succession War mainly due to clan rules and also to temper myself. The head position means little to me.”

Meng Shanyi was silent.

“From this perspective, the family’s choice to back the Second Young Master is wise. Though unstable in mentality, he’s better suited to pursue power and assume the headship,” Yang Wei said with a faint smile, utterly unconcerned.

“Do you feel disappointed that your efforts have been unrewarded?” Yang Wei glanced at the silent Meng Shanyi.

Meng Shanyi lightly shook his head. “To hear your true feelings is already an honor. If you don’t want to be head, I must change my mindset.”

After a pause, he asked, “Should we cooperate with the Second Young Master then?”

Yang Wei laughed. “Since this comes from the Meng Family and the Eight Great Families have joined forces with Yang Family’s tacit approval, how can I refuse? Just make an appearance. You’ll go. From now on, this won’t be a Succession War anymore.”

In fact, from the moment Yang Kai ascended to Divine Roaming Realm, the Succession War should have been over.

What followed were just secret intrigues staged under its name by the Eight Great Families.

“I understand.” Meng Shanyi nodded slightly and turned to leave, preparing to contact Yang Zhao’s estate.

Once Meng Shanyi departed, Yang Wei’s expression became solemn. He pondered long and hard, still unable to understand why Ninth Brother was being targeted so severely.

He felt a deep sorrow for him.

Meanwhile, at Yang Zhao’s estate.

Groups of experts gathered rapidly. These were masters who had not appeared previously in the Succession War but now seemed to have arrived as if by prior agreement.

The original warriors at Yang Zhao’s estate watched in stunned silence.

They noticed that many among these reinforcements were high-level Divine Roaming Realm masters, Ninth Stage in particular abundant, alongside countless Seventh and Eighth Stage cultivators.

There were seven groups in total, each assembled with extraordinary force.

Those with sharp eyes immediately discerned the origins of these seven groups.

These were all forces dispatched by the Zhongdu Eight Great Families. Except for the Yang Family, representatives were present from the other seven clans.

Among these groups, a man and a woman exchanged a look filled with helplessness and pain.

After a while, the man walked over to where the woman stood and nodded.

They found a secluded corner and gazed at the multitude of masters assembled, their expressions heavy.

These two were Huo Xingchen and Qiu Yimeng.

They had left War City that very morning but returned by nightfall.

In just one day, they had been forced to switch allegiances, from allies of Yang Kai to allies of Yang Zhao—a swift and bitter irony.

“What conditions did your father offer you?” Huo Xingchen asked softly while glancing at Qiu Yimeng.

“To inherit the Qiu Family’s great cause as a daughter!” Qiu Yimeng breathed out softly.

“Congratulations—that’s what you’ve dreamed of, isn’t it?” Huo Xingchen smiled.

“Yes.” Qiu Yimeng tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, her beautiful eyes clouded with confusion. “What about you?”

“The old man said if I didn’t come, he’d cast me out of the Huo Family, forbidding me from setting foot in the family again... The old man is serious, and I can’t afford to play games,” Huo Xingchen said helplessly with a bitter smile.

“Looks like we’ve both compromised.”

“Yes.”

They looked at each other and then, in unison, sneered, “Despicable!”
