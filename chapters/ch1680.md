## Chapter 1680 — White-Clad Corpse General

Yang Kai's overwhelming soul power made the white-clad man flinch; humiliated and furious, he let out a long roar and his whole being underwent a startling transformation.

Just like Fang Fengqi, whom Yang Kai had slain back in Tianyun City, his body suddenly swelled in size. White, needle-like hairs sprouted from his exposed skin, two sharp fangs jutted from the corners of his mouth, and even the breath he exhaled was a sickly green corpse miasma.

He leapt straight into the air like a fired cannonball, blasting a gaping hole through the palace roof. His eyes burned with ferocity as he locked onto the direction of Yang Kai’s approach. Both hands, sharp as talons, slashed through the air again and again, sending out claw-lights capable of tearing space itself as they struck toward Yang Kai.

"Get lost!" Yang Kai barked. Without dodging, his fist wrapped in ink-black flame slammed forward.

The skyfull of claw light shattered. The enormous force struck the white-clad man, forcing from him a muffled groan as he fell like a meteor toward the ground.

Moments later, with a thunderous boom, a human-shaped crater was blasted into the ground.

The white-clad man grew even more violent and enraged. Having endured Yang Kai's blow seemingly with little injury, he sprang from the pit and spat out a round bead; concentrated jade-green corpse qi condensed into arrow-like shafts that rained toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's wrist twitched and the Dragon Bone sword Dripping Jade appeared, infused with Saint Yuan. With a lofty roar of a dragon, the Dragon Bone sword trembled and transformed into a jade-green giant dragon that lunged downward, thrashing head and tail.

Yang Kai stood alone atop the dragon's head, looking down at the white-clad man with nothing but disdain in his eyes.

That corpse qi, enough to fell an Origin Returning Realm expert on contact, had no effect on the Jade-Green Giant Dragon; both corpse qi and the dragon were toxic, and the corpse qi could do nothing to it.

Instead, the jade-green giant dragon opened its maw and swallowed the jade-green corpse qi spewing from the corpse pearl, leaving the white-clad man in a panic.

The distance closed in an instant.

Fixing his gaze on the expanding dragon head and its gaping maw, the white-clad man could no longer remain composed. He howled and scrambled away.

The jade-green giant dragon lunged at empty air. Yang Kai leapt from the dragon's head, beckoned, and the dragon instantly condensed back into the Dragon Bone sword, which he gripped and brought down in a brutal strike.

It seemed as if he would cleave the very heavens; the bladeless long sword exuded a harrowing aura.

The white-clad man was horror-struck and hurriedly raised an arm to block.

Silent and swift, a green flash passed—the arm, covered in white hair, was severed and fell to the ground.

The white-clad man was truly frightened now. He had never expected such a terrifying figure to exist on Dark Star; he had once sparred with the rumored strongest on Dark Star, Ye Xijun, and thought she was nothing special. Yet this sudden youth surpassed Ye Xijun by far; he was utterly outmatched.

Seeing another blow coming, the white-clad man no longer cared for pride and rolled away, avoiding the strike while snatching up his severed arm, then staggered to his feet and retreated.

Only after he had put roughly a hundred zhang between himself and Yang Kai did he halt in trembling relief, pressing the severed arm to the wound while glowering.

At the place where Yang Kai's Dragon Bone sword had chopped off the arm, flesh sprouts had grown and writhed, and in moments the arm was reattached.

While the white-clad man did this, Yang Kai watched coldly without intervening. When the arm was back in place Yang Kai suddenly smiled: "Have we met somewhere before?"

Hearing that, the white-clad man's brows knitted, then recognition dawned. Pointing at Yang Kai, he cried incredulously, "It's you—it's really you!"

"We did meet," Yang Kai smiled lightly. "It was in that Corpse Den; I remember you now."

The first time Yang Kai saw the white-clad man he felt some familiarity; now he recalled it—he and Yang Yan had once delved beneath Zangxiong Valley into the Corpse Den and had crossed paths with this white-clad man, who had even attacked them.

Back then the white-clad man had already been at the Corpse General tier, and a single blow had forced Yang Kai to flee. Over the years his strength had clearly increased.

"I remember you too!" the white-clad man sneered. "You sneaked into the Corpse Den and stole many things, but this Protector should thank you!"

"Thank me for what?" Yang Kai frowned.

"For taking away that chunk of Sun's True Essence! If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have my present achievements!" the white-clad man laughed heartily.

"What does the Sun's True Essence have to do with it?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

"You wouldn't understand even if I told you!" the white-clad man sneered. "I am of the Corpse Spirit Sect, the White-Clad Corpse General—Kang Feirao. Boy, state your name!"

"White-Clad Corpse General..." Yang Kai arched an eyebrow. "Is there a Red-Clad Corpse General and a Green-Clad one as well?"

He recalled seeing several other corpse generals wearing different colors in the Corpse Den.

"Indeed!" Kang Feirao did not deny it. "Boy, our Corpse Spirit Sect will one day unify Dark Star. You are young and your cultivation is not weak; why not join our Corpse Spirit Sect? I will report to the Sect Master and get you a Deacon post!"

"Not interested," Yang Kai sneered.

“Brat, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit! This Protector is merely showing some appreciation for talent—do you really think I can’t deal with you?”

"Can you?" Yang Kai smiled lightly.

As soon as the words fell, Kang Feirao's face changed; he suddenly realized that Yang Kai, who had been a hundred zhang away, had somehow closed the gap in an instant and launched a surprise attack right before him—a massive spatial rift formed at his fingertips, like a great blade slicing toward him!

"Spatial Force!" Kang Feirao's already ashen face drained further. He recalled that when Yang Kai had escaped the Corpse Den before, it was by relying on Spatial Force.

Seeing him display such a technique now demonstrated how profound his mastery of Spatial Force had become.

A chill crept over Kang Feirao and he retreated rapidly, narrowly avoiding the consuming rift.

A hint of vexation flickered across Yang Kai's face, but it was quickly replaced by a sly smile.

Kang Feirao sensed something amiss but could not put a finger on it. Before he could react, an immense force slammed into his back as if a mountain thousands of zhang high had fallen upon him, and the sound of bones shattering echoed within his body.

From the heavy blow Kang Feirao opened his mouth, spewing a gush of jade-green blood. His spirit wilted, and he tumbled toward Yang Kai under the momentum.

Struggling, he barely managed to turn and see what had silently crept close enough to strike him so heavily.

When he looked he went dumbfounded.

The assailant turned out to be a simple-minded stone giant wielding a black staff!

The stone giant had no life aura at all—that was why Kang Feirao had been unable to detect it.

"Now let's see how you dodge!" Yang Kai grinned ferociously as a flurry of spatial rifts formed and wove into a heavenly net that closed to seal off Kang Feirao's escape routes.

Kang Feirao's face twisted as he felt the uncanny force within the rifts. He took a deep breath and suddenly halted.

In the next instant his entire body seemed to turn to nothingness and he sharply burrowed into the earth!

It was as if he could fuse with the ground itself.

The web of spatial rifts swept over his head and accomplished little.

"Block him!" Yang Kai's expression grew grave; he knew he absolutely could not let Kang Feirao vanish underground, or he wouldn't be able to find him again.

The Stone Puppet received the order and vanished from where it stood, diving into the earth.

Soon after, tremendous combat fluctuations rolled up from below; the ground heaved like waves spreading outward.

Moments later, followed by a furious roar, Kang Feirao burst from the ground, his face contorted.

The Stone Puppet gave chase without pause, wielding the Heaven-Shaking Pillar as if it were weightless, swinging a blur of staff strikes that forced Kang Feirao to keep moving.

Using burrowing tricks in front of the Stone Puppet was nothing but foolishness on Kang Feirao's part.

Burrowing is one of the Stone Puppet's native divine arts.

Yang Kai had by now arrived high above Kang Feirao. With a flick of his fingers dozens of Golden Blood Threads spilled forth like golden serpents and wrapped about Kang Feirao.

In an instant they bound him tightly.

Kang Feirao tried to struggle, but the Stone Puppet's Heaven-Shaking Pillar slammed down and pulverized his lower body into paste, the force flinging his torso in twisting circles through the air.

Misfortune was not finished: spatial rifts formed like gaping maws and devoured the majority of his body.

When Kang Feirao crashed to the ground, only a mutilated torso remained.

An ordinary person would have long since been beyond saving from such wounds.

But the Corpse Spirit Race were born of the dead; their vitality was tenacious—such injuries could not claim his life so easily.

Intense energy rippled from his abdomen through his limbs as the flesh around the wound writhed and began repairing his damaged body.

Yang Kai stepped forward and plunged his hand into Kang Feirao's belly, seizing the Corpse Pearl.

The writhing flesh finally stilled. Kang Feirao lay motionless, staring at Yang Kai with terror in his eyes.

His eyes full of hate, he ultimately relented and sighed: "Speak—what do you want in exchange for sparing me?"

"You're bargaining with me?" Yang Kai sneered contemptuously.

"Indeed!"

"You think you have the qualification?" Yang Kai continued to sneer.

"You spared me because you want something; otherwise why leave me alive?" Kang Feirao snorted.

"You're clever," Yang Kai nodded. "But you still lack the standing to negotiate—someone like you I could crush with one hand!"

Kang Feirao's face flickered and he could not retort.
