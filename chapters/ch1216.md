## Chapter 1216 — A Hair’s Breadth from Death

"Senior Brother, did you send a message to Junior Brother Yang? Has he replied?" Xuan'er suddenly turned to Wei Guchang and asked.

"No!" Wei Guchang answered with a bitter smile.

"Could it be that Junior Brother Yang—" Xuan'er trailed off, a wash of worry showing on her face.

"You think he would perish here?" Wei Guchang gave a short laugh, then shook his head. "I don't think so. With his methods and skill, unless his luck is as rotten as ours and he ran into one of these strange formations, he wouldn't fall."

"Then why has he given no reply?" Xuan'er's pretty eyes dimmed; instinctively she felt Yang Kai must have encountered something, which was why he hadn't responded.

Wei Guchang hesitated, unsure how to answer. After a moment's thought he sighed, "Perhaps Brother Yang didn't check the Transmission Compass. Before we came in I sensed he wanted to act alone. Even though I gave him the Transmission Compass, if he didn't inspect it how would he know we were trapped and couldn't leave? Now... he is the only one I can call for help, and with his ability he should be able to reach the Third Layer. Let's hope our luck isn't terrible."

"Senior Brother Wei, the lava formation has erupted again!" One of the two male disciples cried out in alarm.

The remaining four all went pale, turning to look. The once relatively calm lava lake now boiled as if set to a boil—more bubbles burst up from below, several right beneath them, the blasted fire venom and corroding power from their rupture rapidly spreading toward the five of them.

Wei Guchang snorted, waved his hand, and a burst of crimson thunderfire flickered out, driving those fire-venom and corrosive forces away and keeping them at bay.

But after exerting himself even this little, Wei Guchang swayed slightly; in times past he would not have feared such fire-venom and corrosion, yet now, spent to the bone, any technique he used brought a tremendous burden.

"They're coming!" the male disciple called out tremblingly. Dark-red lava in the lake surged up, forming columns of flame that rushed from all directions toward the central spot.

This had happened countless times over the past month. Each time it took the five of them combined to hold back the eruption of the formation. But this time felt different.

"Why so many?" The tall woman's face changed at the sheer number of attacks the formation spat out; she stood nearly stunned.

This time, the number of attacks released by the restriction was far greater than before. They had already struggled to cope with the previous waves, and Wei Guchang had sustained multiple injuries. Now that none of them were at their peak condition, how could they possibly withstand this new onslaught?

It's over! The tall female disciple and the two other young men went ashen, staring dumbly at the lava pillars barreling toward them. They no longer intended to resist but stood resigned, as if awaiting death.

"Don't panic!" Wei Guchang barked. He and Xuan'er poured the remainder of their strength into the turtle shell, igniting its protective power.

The red-hot turtle shell suddenly shone with a blue-tinged barrier; within that veil was an intense water-element aura that enveloped the five of them.

Hisssss...

The lava pillars struck the veil; the blue light trembled and after the first wave of attacks it teetered on the verge of collapse.

When the second wave of formation attacks arrived, it shattered completely.

A chill ran through Wei Guchang's heart—this time escape truly seemed impossible. If his three Junior Brothers and Junior Sister weren't resigned to die, they might have lasted a few breaths longer, but with no action from them, the turtle shell's protection could not hold with only him and Xuan'er.

So be it. To die beneath such a strange formation would not disgrace his life of brilliance—yet...

Wei Guchang turned to look at Xuan'er and met her gaze; the two exchanged a faint smile, words unspoken yet everything understood.

Swish, swish, swish...

Strange sounds came from afar, as if energy had been shot over long distance; then, around the turtle shell, countless shields formed like coalesced black fire—shield after shield, dense and countless, sealing off the space around the five.

The lava pillars continued to assault them, but the shields repelled them all. Shield after shield was smashed, and more formed in succession until the space around the turtle shell was guarded with no gaps.

Then from that distant spot, black sword lights streaked over and swept many of the incoming lava pillars aside mid-flight.

From near death to life again, the five atop the turtle shell all broke into expressions of joy and turned to look toward the source of the sword lights.

"Brother Yang!" When Wei Guchang saw Yang Kai—the one who had saved them at the critical moment—he burst into loud laughter. Yang Kai stood at the lake's edge, wielding a pitch-black demonic sword like an ancient demon god descended, continuously cleaving out black, swirling sword radiance.

"Keep at it!" While easing the burden on Wei Guchang's group, Yang Kai took his purple shield from the ring and hurled it with all his might toward them.

The shield was his Secret Treasure; only he could unleash its full power. It was, however, intrinsically sturdy—forged from the hard shell of a Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast—and had defensive capability. Letting Wei Guchang borrow it temporarily was acceptable.

The Purple Shield transformed into a streak of purple light and landed perfectly into Wei Guchang's hands.

Catching the shield, Wei Guchang immediately used it to block the densest onslaught of lava pillars, and he shouted back to Yang Kai from afar, "Brother Yang, such great favor needs no thanks—once this passes I'll repay you properly!"

"Mm, and take this too!" Yang Kai nodded and tossed over a jade vial.

Xuan'er was the one to catch it, and upon opening the cap she cried out with delight, "It's an Ice-Snow Pill!"

The three disciples of Yingyue Hall leaped for joy upon hearing that, calling out, "Senior Sister Dong, give me one quickly!"

The five had long since exhausted their pills; the Ice-Snow Pill was a timely salvation—taking one would greatly lessen their strain.

Xuan'er nodded and poured the Ice-Snow Pills out, giving one to each of the three, then shoved one into Wei Guchang's mouth before taking one herself.

Once the Ice-Snow Pill entered their bodies, a chill spread through the five, driving away the unbearable heat and fire-venom; the three recovered spirit and strength as if from nothing and no longer wished to await death. They each unleashed their methods to stop the lava pillars that had broken through the Vast Heaven Shield and were heading toward them.

On the lava shore, Yang Kai used the Profound Heaven Sword to relieve Wei Guchang's group, periodically expending Saint Yuan to conjure a Vast Heaven Shield at range for their protection.

The ugly woman who had come with him only heaved a heavy breath once they reached the shore.

Whatever secret art she had used, she hadn't even been breathing while racing here, yet she had trailed Yang Kai closely and only began to recover upon arriving.

Seeing the danger, she silently threw out a brocade handkerchief-like Secret Treasure, which became a swirl of pink clouds. Wherever those pink clouds hovered around Wei Guchang's group, any lava pillars covered by them simply vanished.

"Huh—the Rainbow Handkerchief?" Xuan'er recognized the Secret Treasure at a glance and glanced toward the shore. When she saw the ugly woman's figure she exclaimed with delight, "So Sister Daiyuan is with Senior Brother Yang."

As far as she knew, Daiyuan had always kept to herself because of her looks; even among fellow disciples she never traveled in company. Yang Kai likewise seemed like a lone operator—these two traveling together was truly strange.

"Perhaps they happened to meet on the way." Wei Guchang chuckled, spirited. "But whatever the case, this danger should be over. Later we'll have Brother Yang find a way to get us up out of here."

"Mm, Sister Daiyuan's Snow Silkworm Silk should work; it shouldn't fear this lava." Xuan'er brightened. The three remaining Yingyue Hall disciples heard this and smiled broadly, their previous gloom and despair wiped away.

The killing power of the lava formation on the lake wasn't especially great; it was the entrapment that had left Wei Guchang's group helpless. With Yang Kai and Daiyuan's help, the five on the turtle shell fended off this eruption without further injury.

When everything finally calmed down, everyone let out a quiet breath of relief. The feeling of surviving a brush with death was not something one could experience often.

The five rested a little on the turtle shell and recovered their breath. After a moment Wei Guchang stood and called loudly to Yang Kai, "Brother Yang, don't rush into the lava lake. My Origin-Grade Secret Treasure couldn't withstand those scalding waters—it would be destroyed in an instant."

“How am I supposed to get you all up there?” While they were recovering, Yang Kai had already examined the lava lake. This lava was far from ordinary — even with his strength, he dared not dive into it recklessly. Just as he was at a loss, Wei Guchang spoke up.

"Have Sister Daiyuan help." Wei Guchang smiled at the woman beside Yang Kai.

So that's her name—Daiyuan! Only then did Yang Kai learn the woman's name.

Daiyuan bit her red lip and said to Wei Guchang, "I don't know whether Snow Silkworm Silk can resist this lava. If it is destroyed, another plan will be needed."

“I know,” Wei Guchang said with a slight nod. “If the Snow Silkworm Threads are damaged, I will certainly compensate Junior Sister Daiyuan.”

"Who wants your compensation? I only want to save Sister Xuan'er." Daiyuan snorted, clearly not fond of Wei Guchang, leaving him awkwardly smiling.

Despite her words, she quickly produced that white thread Yang Kai had seen her use before.

Earlier, when Yang Kai had watched her struggle with that Battle Sky Alliance disciple, he hadn't realized the material of that thread—now he saw it was Snow Silkworm Silk!
