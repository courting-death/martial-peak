## Chapter 1775 — Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi

"Mm. No mistake, this is absolutely a Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit!" Yang Kai grinned widely. "Across heaven and earth, whenever a spirit flower or strange herb bears the character 'Sacred' or 'Dao' in its name, it is without fail a treasure. During its growth it attracts the power of the world's laws to nurture it—its maturation is gruelling; if conditions even slightly fail it withers and dies. But once ripe, it carries a trace of wondrous law-power itself. Whether swallowed whole or refined into a Pill, it benefits Void King Realm experts enormously! Elder, our luck isn’t bad!"

"Heh heh heh… you brat know a fair bit about spiritual medicines," the Ghost Ancestor said in high spirits, glancing at Yang Kai with a hint of surprise.

"Only a little," Yang Kai chuckled.

"Mm, there happen to be four of them; as agreed just now, you and I will split them evenly!" The Ghost Ancestor said as he reached for the Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit nearest him.

"Wait!" Yang Kai hurriedly stopped him.

"What?" the Ghost Ancestor asked, puzzled.

"Elder, taking the Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit like that isn’t a big problem, but if you don’t preserve them properly the potency will drain severely," Yang Kai warned.

"Oh? How should one preserve them?" the Ghost Ancestor asked humbly. He knew some rare flowers and herbs required special methods to keep their efficacy; the loss of potency for a Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit would be unimaginable. From Yang Kai’s tone it was clear he knew how to store them, so the Ghost Ancestor pressed for details.

"Simple—store them in a container of metal attribute," Yang Kai explained with a smile. "Look, the area where this Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit grew is saturated with a strong metal-attribute aura. If I’m right, there should be a mineral vein beneath the tree, and the fruit-tree depends on that vein to grow. Match the storage to its growth habit and you’re set."

"I see!" the Ghost Ancestor nodded lightly.

Among the Five Elements, Metal restrains Wood, so using a metal-type box to store the Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit was perfectly reasonable. However… the fact that this fruit tree was actually growing atop a mineral vein was truly beyond comprehension.

The Ghost Ancestor didn’t probe further; he produced a deep-red metal box from his Spatial Ring and asked Yang Kai, "Is this all right?"

"Ah… a box made of Nethermetal—Elder, you actually have such a treasure; that’s certainly fine. Put the Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruit inside it and even after a thousand years its potency won’t have leaked away a hair’s breadth!" Yang Kai nodded.

"Very well, then I won’t stand on ceremony," the Ghost Ancestor laughed and first plucked two Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruits, carefully placing them into his Nethermetal box for safekeeping.

Yang Kai retrieved the remaining two Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruits as well. He didn’t possess a Nethermetal box, but as an alchemist he routinely carried many containers for storing materials, and a metal one was not lacking.

After splitting the four Brahma Heaven Sacred Fruits evenly, the two of them resumed their search with renewed enthusiasm, slipping past the surrounding spatial rifts while hunting for the ancient spiritual medicines scattered throughout the Medicine Valley.

The Medicine Valley was vast beyond measure; no one could say how large it was. In any case, after Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor rushed in, they saw no one else and had no idea where others might have gone.

Moreover, searching for spiritual medicine here was tremendously convenient because these specimens were old enough to give off strong medicinal scents; one only needed to follow the aroma and one would surely harvest something.

Half an hour later, the two of them once again used that trait to locate a lingzhi the size of a palm.

The lingzhi grew in a fissure of the rock and was extremely hard to spot; if the scent hadn’t been so intense, they would likely have missed it.

"Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi!" Without Yang Kai needing to point it out, the Ghost Ancestor recognized the herb at once and his heart fluttered. "This is a Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi! Heh heh heh, my luck is really quite good."

"Congratulations, Elder. This Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi looks to be two thousand years old; if refined into a Demon-Suppressing Pill, Void King Realm experts would fight to the death for it," Yang Kai said with a grin as he cupped his fist.

The Ghost Ancestor glanced at Yang Kai and said, "Mm, this will be of great use to me; I’ll take it first. If later we find anything else, whatever it is you will receive an extra share, Boy Yang—no problem?"

"Of course no problem," Yang Kai answered magnanimously.

The primary use of the Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi was to dispel heart demons. When a warrior cultivated or attempted a breakthrough, heart demons might occasionally arise—these were the shadows hidden within one’s heart.

When one witnesses the strong bullying the weak yet, out of fear, fails to draw their blade to help, such a matter can become a heart demon.

Being wronged and unable to avenge oneself—such matters could become heart demons.

The death of a beloved woman and the ensuing melancholy—this too could become a heart demon.

A heart demon is a general term encompassing all the regrets and negative emotions that dwell within a cultivator’s heart.

They were extremely harmful. Ordinarily a heart demon wouldn’t influence a warrior too much, but as a cultivator’s strength rose the danger a heart demon posed would grow accordingly. Especially at the moment of breakthrough, a heart demon’s power could be magnified without limit; if it could not be suppressed, the breakthrough might fail—at best the realm would be lost, at worst one would suffer Qi Deviation and fall irretrievably.

Therefore, high-level cultivators usually make exhaustive preparations when attempting breakthroughs; one common method was to take certain spiritual Pills.

The Demon-Suppressing Pill refined from the Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi was the best remedy for subduing heart demons. Even if not refined into a Pill, chewing a slice of the Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi during a breakthrough could produce miraculous effects.

The Ghost Ancestor was at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm; ascending to the Third Stage would be fraught with difficulty. Given his lifetime of unresolved grudges and his practice of demonic arts, the power of his heart demons was certainly not small; across the world, only the Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi could suppress the might of his inner demons.

That was why he had made such a proposal.

Yang Kai naturally did not refuse.

The Ghost Ancestor treasured the Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi like a precious object; Yang Kai, however, cared little for it.

In Lingxiao Sect’s Ascension Dragon Hall there existed a treasure-level item called Ten-Thousand-Year Incense, which likewise dissolved heart demons and whose effect surpassed even that of a Demon-Suppressing Pill. In other words, the Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi was of no use to Yang Kai.

“I’ll remember this favor,” the Ghost Ancestor said solemnly, then carefully collected the Transforming Demon Mushroom. While doing so, he even sought Yang Kai’s opinion, asking whether any special method was needed to preserve it. After learning that none was required, he proceeded without further hesitation.

Just as the Ghost Ancestor plucked the Demon-Dispelling Lingzhi, Yang Kai—who had been standing nearby—suddenly changed expression and whispered, "Elder, did you hear something?"

The Ghost Ancestor paused and pricked up his ears to listen.

Moments later, both their faces changed sharply as they hissed in low voices, "Bad—Seven Luminaries Treasure Light!"

A breath-sound came from somewhere far off…

With that peculiar noise the Medicine Valley trembled. Looking toward the sound’s source, seven-colored radiance surged like a tide, sweeping across the valley just as it had earlier retreated.

"Where are the spatial rifts?" the Ghost Ancestor asked Yang Kai anxiously.

The numerous spatial rifts that had been nearby were all gone; with no other option the Ghost Ancestor could only place his hope in Yang Kai.

The Seven Luminaries Treasure Light was the aura produced when the divine bird Seven Luminaries Peacock inhaled and exhaled; it could erode soul and rot flesh, ignoring any defense—even the Ghost Ancestor lacked the confidence to withstand it.

The only way to evade it was to rely on the spatial rifts present in this place.

"This way!" Yang Kai appeared not especially panicked; as if with confidence, he beckoned to the Ghost Ancestor and swiftly shot toward a spot in the sky.

The Ghost Ancestor’s figure flickered and turned into a black light, tailing closely behind.

A moment later, the two stood suspended in the air, motionless.

"Is there really a spatial rift here?" the Ghost Ancestor looked around, seeing the Seven Luminaries Treasure Light growing ever closer from the depths of the Medicine Valley and feeling a spike of alarm.

"Of course there is," Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Elder needn’t worry; I’m not one to gamble with my life. Hmm, this spatial rift is fairly large—about this long!"

Yang Kai spoke as he gestured.

Seeing him so matter-of-fact, the Ghost Ancestor finally relaxed a little.

At that moment the Seven Luminaries Treasure Light had already swept over them!

Despite Yang Kai’s assurances, watching that terrifying radiance rush toward their position made the Ghost Ancestor break out in a cold sweat.

Since ascending to the Void King Realm he had not experienced such fear in a long while.

Soundless and silent…

The Seven Luminaries Treasure Light flowed past the place where the two of them stood and, with terrifying speed, filled the entire Medicine Valley.

Yet where Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor stood there remained a narrow strip roughly five zhang long that the Treasure Light did not fill; the dreadful radiance in front of that strip seemed to plunge into a bottomless abyss and vanish, leaving a patch of safety behind.

The Ghost Ancestor let out a long breath and finally set his mind at ease.

Yang Kai had been right—the Treasure Light had outlined the presence of the spatial rift, and its shape and size were exactly as Yang Kai had indicated.

The Ghost Ancestor’s gaze toward Yang Kai grew slightly complicated.

He had studied Spatial Force and knew how difficult mastery of that power was. He had lingered on the Floating Continent for two thousand years and couldn’t even get an entrance, yet Yang Kai demonstrated astonishing attainments in this domain; by comparison the Ghost Ancestor felt his own aptitude shamefully poor.

Moreover… when he had first seen Yang Kai, the youth had only been at the First Stage of the Saint Realm; now Yang Kai had already reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Such rapid progress was rare across the Star Domain.

"This brat will certainly become the brightest new star in the Star Domain," the Ghost Ancestor thought.
