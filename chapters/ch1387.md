## Chapter 1387 — Shattering the Void

The warships on Dark Star were all low-grade and extremely scarce; only a few major sects could possess them.

The Haike Family last sent a warship into the Star Domain after spending a fortune renting one from Yingyue Hall, and the Haike Family paid a heavy price for it.

Refining a single warship is not a simple matter — it often requires hundreds or even more artificers working together for many years to complete.

Yet Yang Yan managed to reach this level by her lone effort.

It’s small, yes, but it still qualifies as a warship.

"So what? I can refine a bigger one," Yang Yan said proudly, and if she had a tail it would already be wagging to the sky.

Yang Kai gaped, suddenly feeling his mouth dry as he stared at her with hopeful expectation.

Why was Dark Star isolated and unable to trade with other stars in the Star Domain? Simply put, its location was too remote; the nearest inhabited star was several years' travel away, and the route was fraught with danger. A warship refined to Dark Star's standards could not possibly support such a long, perilous voyage.

If there were a Void King-Grade warship, or at least an Upper-Level Origin-Grade warship, the fighters on Dark Star could fully restore contact with the outside.

Yang Kai had been stranded on Dark Star for quite some time and knew there were only two ways to leave: either become powerful enough to ignore the Star Domain’s perils and travel the star path by his own strength, or use a high-grade warship.

Neither path was easy — to say nothing of Dark Star’s restrictive natural laws preventing cultivators from breaking into the Void King Realm, a warship capable of withstanding the Star Domain’s hazards simply couldn’t be produced.

Yet now Yang Yan produced one. The Flying Shark Battle Shuttle was absolutely a secret treasure capable of supporting long-distance Star Domain voyages.

This gave him hope of leaving Dark Star!

He suddenly felt that the distance between himself and the woman he yearned for had inexplicably shrunk. Before hearing news of Su Yan he had no particular designs, but learning that Su Yan also lived safely somewhere in this Star Domain made him dream that one day he could go find her.

And Xia Ningshang, who lived on Tongxuan Continent! Yang Kai very much wanted to return and see how she was doing.

Seeing Yang Kai stare at her, Yang Yan knew exactly what he was thinking and glared playfully at him. "Fine, fine. Once this is settled, I’ll let you see it. The thing has long been refined — it’s just been kept in Dragon Lair Mountain’s underground vault. It still needs some improvements though; using it now would be a bit premature."

"Dragon Lair Mountain has an underground vault?" Yang Kai asked, more astonished.

Yang Yan laughed lightly. "You’ve been meditating all day, of course you don’t know."

Yang Kai felt sheepish. Although he was the lord of Dragon Lair Mountain, he never meddled in its affairs; the only thing he concerned himself with was funding. If Saint Crystals or materials ran low, he would find a way to procure them. What they were used for, he never asked.

He had thought Dragon Lair Mountain spent like water because Yang Yan was arranging formations. Now he realized she had been refining warships.

No wonder no amount of Saint Crystals and materials ever seemed enough for her. Remembering the scale of the warships he’d seen at Shuiyue Star under the Hengluo Commerce Guild, Yang Kai’s mind cleared.

As they spoke, the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle surged forward at incredible speed. Yang Kai’s Divine Sense reached out and could scarcely keep up with it — that showed just how fast it was.

"I’m going to run a test. If anything goes wrong later, remember to save me," Yang Yan said suddenly and inexplicably.

"What?" Yang Kai blinked, before seeing Yang Yan smile oddly. Saint Yuan swelled about her and she poured it into a complex formation before them. A loud humming filled the room as all the Origin Saint Crystals slotted into the grooves flared brilliantly, and terrifying energy fluctuations gathered.

Yang Kai’s face showed shock as he turned to the Origin Saint Crystals and found, with horror, that their light dimmed in an instant, as if all their internal energy had been drained.

He quickly tallied the total energy in his head; even Yang Kai, with his steady temperament, went pale.

Boom……

A muffled roar, as if from the nine heavens, shook the soul, and the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle trembled violently.

The next moment Yang Kai saw a pillar of blinding, dazzling energy erupt from somewhere on the Shuttle and strike the void.

That patch of void melted away like snow under the blazing sun, quickly dissolving into a whirl of chaotic nothingness that spun slowly and emitted intense spatial power fluctuations.

"Void Passage!" Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

Yang Yan had already driven the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle into the Void Passage. Yang Kai didn’t even have time to stop her, hearing her tinkle-laughter like a silver bell.

The familiar sensation descended — the weightlessness one feels when passing through a Void Passage or using a Space Array.

The feeling came and left quickly. When everything stabilized, Yang Kai found himself and Yang Yan in an unfamiliar place, the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle slowly emerging from a vast whirl.

Too shocked to waste time, Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense to scan the surroundings and his face darkened the next moment.

Not far ahead, two groups were fighting fiercely. Their strengths were not very high; the leaders were only at the First or Second Stages of the Saint King Realm, while many of the rest were in the Saint Realm.

The two sides totaled some thirty to forty people, and at the center lay several bodies, their deaths gruesome to behold.

Nearby lay the corpse of an Eighth-Tier demonic beast called a Wind-Fire Tanuki; it was clear the two groups had fought over the beast, likely teaming up to slay it and then clashing over the spoils.

Such situations were far too common; with a single Divine Sense sweep Yang Kai guessed the situation almost completely.

"Oh…" Yang Yan murmured, embarrassed. She hadn’t expected the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle’s maiden voyage shattering the void for long-distance teleportation to be witnessed, especially at night in such a remote place where who would have guessed so many would be present.

"What are you standing there for? Let’s go — do you enjoy being stared at like a monkey?" Yang Kai glared at her fiercely.

"Oh." Yang Yan immediately snapped back, tapped the Formation Plate, and with a hum the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle turned into a streak of light and vanished.

Below, both sides who had been fighting froze.

"Senior Brother, what was that?" a woman dressed like a married lady asked a Saint King cultivator nearby, her beautiful eyes trembling. She did not look young but had been well preserved. Her face was full of panic from the recent shock.

"I don’t know either," the Saint King muttered, dazed.

Their narrow experience was excusable — the earlier scene was too shocking: a void whirl had appeared out of nowhere and that shark-like thing had climbed out. Even an Origin Returning cultivator would be taken aback, let alone them.

"But it looks like a warship, doesn’t it?" the man muttered.

"A warship that small?" the married woman doubted. "Little Sister once had the fortune to see Leitai Sect’s warship launch — that was dozens of times larger than what we just saw."

As they spoke, a cry of pain rang out. The man and woman’s expressions turned cold as they saw one of their own struck down by the enemy and bleeding profusely.

The man flew into a rage. "Third Brother Xu — you actually launched a sneak attack; how shameless!"

He summoned his secret treasure and fired, breaking the temporary quiet as the two groups resumed slaughter, and the strange thing they’d seen was forgotten amid blood and hatred.

A thousand miles away above a certain grassland, the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle hung silently.

Inside the warship, Yang Kai’s shock had not yet faded while Yang Yan busily replaced Origin Saint Crystals.

Yang Kai had not expected the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle could shatter the void! Although it consumed a tremendous amount — instantly draining all the energy from more than a hundred Origin Saint Crystals — this was beyond imagination.

Moreover, the distance the Shuttle crossed by shattering the void exceeded what Yang Kai could achieve by tearing space himself; his Divine Sense could detect nothing of their original location.

After a moment, Yang Yan had reinstalled the Origin Saint Crystals and drove the Shuttle forward again.

"How far can a single void-shattering run reach?" Yang Kai asked.

"That last jump was about one hundred thousand li," Yang Yan replied casually, frowning slightly as if not entirely satisfied.

"One hundred thousand li…" Yang Kai breathed out.

"Yes, but the consumption is too great and the landing point is hard to determine. I only used the Space Array principle; it needs more improvement," Yang Yan said, chin resting on her hand as she pondered.

"This cannot be leaked, or it will be a huge problem," Yang Kai warned sternly.

"Heh heh, leaking it won’t matter," Yang Yan said confidently. "Even if others got the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle, they couldn’t use it."

"Why?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Because others don’t have Origin Saint Crystals. Upper-Level Saint Crystals aren’t enough; only the Origin Saint Crystals condensed by Xiaoxiao can meet the requirements to power this Shuttle," Yang Yan explained.

"So that’s why you monopolized the Stone Puppet," Yang Kai said, suddenly understanding.

"Mm." Yang Yan nodded readily.

Poor Stone Puppet… Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he offered a silent lament for it.
