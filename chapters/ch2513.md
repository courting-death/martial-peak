## Chapter 2513 — Masterful Craftsmanship

Ziyue City, one of the countless unremarkable cities in the Eastern Territory, sat near the Ziyue Desert. Because of the harsh environment and barren land surrounding it, this city was never very prosperous.

Its only purpose was to serve as a transit point for the many cultivators entering the Ziyue Desert. Many liked to venture into the desert for training, so Ziyue City naturally became the best place for them to rest and recover.

The cultivators in the city weren’t particularly strong overall, but not weak either—stronger than Fenglin City had been in the past. Most were at the Saint King Realm, and while there were no Emperor Realm cultivators, there were still many at the Dao Origin Realm.

Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi made their way here from the Ziyue Desert, travel-worn, and casually found an inn to stay at.

The Phoenix Egg that Liu Yan had transformed into had already been taken away by Jiu Feng and Li Wuyi. Yang Kai wasn’t worried about Liu Yan’s safety; after all, both Jiu Feng and Li Wuyi were renowned experts in the Star Realm, and they served under the Beast Great Emperor. With Mo Xiaoqi’s connection as well, Yang Kai believed Jiu Feng would surely take good care of Liu Yan and would never harm her.

Yang Kai only worried that Liu Yan’s process of refining the True Phoenix Fire wouldn’t go smoothly.

But now, he was anxious to search for Xiaoxiao’s whereabouts and had no time to accompany Liu Yan. Otherwise, he would have gone to the Spirit Beast Island with them and stayed there for a year.

This was Zhang Ruoxi’s first time going out to train with Yang Kai. In the past, no matter where Yang Kai went, he always arranged for her to stay safely in the Small Xuan Realm to focus on her cultivation.

But now, Zhang Ruoxi had reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm and possessed enough strength to protect herself.

Cultivation isn’t just about shutting oneself away. Yang Kai, who had braved countless hardships, understood this deeply. So, after weighing things, he brought Zhang Ruoxi along. This way, the little girl from the Zhang Family could see more of the customs and scenery of the Star Realm, which would surely benefit her future growth.

Zhang Ruoxi was naturally overjoyed, her spirits high and cheeks flushed along the way. She was like a bird released from its cage, finding everything new and exciting.

Over the next few days, Yang Kai shared all of his cultivation insights and experiences with Zhang Ruoxi. Though the little girl often seemed naive and silly, her talent for cultivation was so astonishing that even Yang Kai was left speechless.

For many key cultivation problems, Zhang Ruoxi could often draw inferences from one example. If not for Yang Kai’s deep foundation, he might not have been able to answer her questions. He racked his brains, verifying his own cultivation path, but at least he didn’t embarrass himself in front of her.

While teaching Zhang Ruoxi, Yang Kai didn’t neglect his own cultivation either.

He had only just advanced to the Emperor Realm, barely worthy of being called an expert. Although various accidents had caused his Emperor Yuan to fully transform, he hadn’t been in this realm long. His control over his power and understanding of the Emperor Realm still lagged behind those veteran Emperors.

The more he cultivated, the more he felt the Martial Dao was endless. It left Yang Kai both in awe and burning with passion.

Especially when he recalled the clash between the two Great Emperors—the overwhelming might unleashed with every movement, every gesture—Yang Kai found himself utterly captivated, unable to tear his thoughts away.

He looked forward to the day when he could reach, or even surpass, that level.

After arriving in Ziyue City and casually finding an inn, Yang Kai booked two rooms. Once settled, he casually set up some restrictions in his own room.

There weren’t many experts in Ziyue City, and he was the only Emperor Realm cultivator. So he wasn’t worried about trouble, but being disturbed during cultivation was always unpleasant. So restrictions were still necessary.

After setting the restrictions, Yang Kai finally reached into his Spatial Ring and took out an item.

It was a blue stone, about the size of a longan fruit, with an extremely irregular shape. At first glance, there was nothing special about it—aside from its odd color, it looked quite ordinary, and there was no strong energy fluctuation. It seemed like a very cheap material for artifact refining.

But this blue stone had come from Li Wuyi’s hand.

Earlier, Li Wuyi had flicked his hand, sending a streak of light toward Yang Kai. What he caught was this blue stone.

Traveling from the Ziyue Desert, Yang Kai hadn’t had time to examine what secrets the stone held. Only now did he have a chance to calm down and study it.

Placing the stone in his palm, Yang Kai solemnly released his Divine Sense to probe it. Soon, his expression changed—his Divine Sense surged out like countless invisible threads wrapping around the stone. His face turned from shock to awe, then excitement and admiration.

Under the probing of his Divine Sense, Yang Kai found that while the surface of the blue stone remained perfectly intact, its interior was shattered and fragmented beyond imagination.

The reason for this was that the inside was filled with countless hair-thin spatial cracks.

Those spatial cracks were almost impossible to detect with the naked eye. If not for Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Sense, he would have missed them entirely.

The spatial cracks inside the stone definitely weren’t made by Li Wuyi in advance. Most likely, he created them casually when Yang Kai asked him to teach a divine ability.

Even so, it was enough to leave Yang Kai deeply shaken.

He was also skilled in space powers, so he knew just how difficult it was to blast so many tiny spatial cracks inside a stone without damaging its surface. This required incredibly precise control over space power and a profound understanding of its mysteries.

Yang Kai had many space techniques—Moon Blade, Exile, Nothingness. He could even use the Laws of Space to instantly freeze an area. All these techniques and applications of space power were things he’d comprehended on his own, without a good teacher.

He thought his attainments in space power were already deep.

But after observing this blue stone, Yang Kai realized he’d been like a frog at the bottom of a well, thinking the sky was only as big as what he could see.

At the very least, he couldn’t replicate what Li Wuyi had done.

He couldn’t control space power so exquisitely, couldn’t create so many spatial cracks inside a stone without damaging its surface, and still keep it whole.

Admirable, truly admirable! Yang Kai’s heart burned with excitement. He’d long heard that Li Wuyi of the Spirit Beast Island in the Eastern Territory was the Star Realm’s foremost expert in space power, but honestly, Yang Kai had always thought he wasn’t far behind.

But today, he finally broadened his horizons.

If space power was a painting, then Li Wuyi was the most outstanding master artist. With a few strokes, a masterpiece appeared before Yang Kai’s eyes—fluid, unrestrained, evoking awe like gazing up at a towering mountain. As for Yang Kai… he could paint, but compared to Li Wuyi, he was far inferior.

He still had a long road ahead!

Every tiny spatial crack inside the stone contained Li Wuyi’s understanding and application of space power. From the outside in, they grew increasingly profound. The outer cracks were rough and unstable, as if they could collapse at any moment, but the deeper inside, the more exquisite and stable they became.

Yang Kai probed layer by layer, marveling at the mysteries of the spatial cracks. It seemed Li Wuyi had perfectly displayed his own growth in space power before Yang Kai’s eyes, holding nothing back.

These spatial cracks were truly the crystallization of Li Wuyi’s life’s work!

He had left them all imprinted as spatial cracks in this stone and handed it to Yang Kai.

This was far more precious than learning a single space divine ability from Li Wuyi. It was as if Li Wuyi had passed down his entire legacy. But how much Yang Kai could comprehend from it would depend on his own talent and effort.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s expression changed, and he sent his Divine Sense probing toward the very center of the stone.

In the next instant, his breath caught and his heart pounded wildly.

He discovered that at the very center of the stone, there was an extremely tiny black hole.

It was just like the black hole formed by his Exile technique, only shrunk countless times over.

Though this black hole was so small it was invisible to the naked eye, it still exuded an aura of devouring all things. When Yang Kai’s Divine Sense touched it, it was swallowed up completely.

This was truly—

Divine craftsmanship, masterful beyond compare!

If those spatial cracks had already left Yang Kai deeply shocked, then the appearance of this final black hole left him utterly awed, making him realize just how far apart he and Li Wuyi truly were.

In the domain of space power, Li Wuyi was indeed far ahead of him—he simply couldn’t compare at present.

Yang Kai was filled with deep respect.

That such a tiny stone could contain so many mysteries was simply unimaginable.

After the shock faded, Yang Kai became obsessed, throwing himself entirely into studying the stone.

He wanted to peel back the layers of secrets hidden within, to absorb all of Li Wuyi’s attainments in space power.

In an instant, Yang Kai forgot everything else, completely immersed in the stone’s mysteries, unable to extricate himself.

He probed each spatial crack, feeling its stability and hidden wonders, experiencing how it was formed.

It was as if he had split Li Wuyi open and could study him however he wished.

One day, two days, five days, ten days…

As he studied the stone, Li Wuyi’s journey of growth in space power seemed to vividly unfold before Yang Kai’s eyes, letting him experience firsthand the process of becoming stronger and more at ease in this domain.

At first, Yang Kai was still comprehending Li Wuyi’s attainments and learning his exquisite methods. But as time passed, Yang Kai was no longer satisfied with just learning from others.

He would first comprehend Li Wuyi’s understanding of a spatial crack, then overturn it and try it himself, transforming it into his own foundation.

Yang Kai forgot to eat or sleep, completely absorbed.

Though his strength didn’t increase, his eyes became sunken, his gaze bloodshot, and he looked half-crazed. Yet his eyes were bright, his spirit extremely excited.

In this period, his growth in space power surpassed what he’d gained in the past ten or twenty years.

He could clearly feel that he had taken a great step forward on the path of the Power of Space.
