## Chapter 957 — Decision

Yang Kai read their expressions, understood their difficulties, paused to consider, and then invited, "If you like, come with me back to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land."

Shui Yun was taken aback, and looked at Yang Kai with some surprise. "Is that appropriate?"

"There's nothing improper about it, only that the environment there isn't ideal for your cultivation. Of course, if Senior Shui is willing, you can first hold a steward post at my Nine Heavens Sacred Land, and if in the future you wish to revive the Water Divine Hall, my Sacred Land will fully support you!"

Hearing Yang Kai's words, a deep joy and gratitude flooded Shui Yun's eyes.

"In that case, I thank Saint Lord Yang for this great kindness!" Shui Yun was moved to tears with gratitude.

"Shui Ling and I are friends; Senior Shui needn't be so formal," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

Shui Yun possessed the strength of the First Stage of the Saint Realm; taking a steward post at the Sacred Land would not be a humiliation for him.

After discussion, the three of them set off together for the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Two days later Yang Kai returned and immediately sent word to Lingxiao Pavilion.

Half a day later Su Mu, Su Xuanwu and Ling Taixu arrived at the Sacred Land and met Yang Kai inside the main hall.

At that moment several elders of the Sacred Land and the leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan were all present, faces solemn and the atmosphere heavy.

Sensing the wrongness of the mood, Ling Taixu could not help but frown and looked at Yang Kai suspiciously, wondering why he had summoned all the high-ranking figures together.

"Yang Kai, where is Su Yan?" Su Xuanwu asked, concerned for his granddaughter's safety; he scanned the hall but found no sign of Su Yan and could not help but inquire.

"Yes, brother-in-law, where has Sister gone?" Su Mu also asked in puzzlement. They all knew Yang Kai had gone out to find Su Yan, yet now Yang Kai had returned and Su Yan was nowhere to be seen, which made them uneasy, fearing something had happened to her.

Yang Kai hesitated a moment, chose his words carefully, and said, "Su Yan is safe for now, but she is no longer on the Tongxuan Continent."

Su Mu was stunned, scratched his head and said, "What do you mean? Sister isn't on the Tongxuan Continent—did she go to some Small Xuan Realm?"

They had been here a while and had some understanding of the wondrous Small Xuan Realms; those from the Great Han even knew that their homeland counted as a rather large Small Xuan Realm.

Yang Kai shook his head and pointed to the heavens, "She went into the starry sky."

In the main hall, everyone's bodies trembled violently; the Sacred Land elders and the Ancient Demon Clan leaders looked at Yang Kai in utter disbelief.

"The starry sky?" Ling Taixu furrowed his brow. "Isn't the starry sky said to be full of peril? That fellow Wu Jie once told me that unless one's cultivation reaches the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, anyone who enters the starry sky will surely die."

"Yes, that's what was said, but Su Yan didn't go alone this time. Five Saint Realm practitioners accompanied her, and they possess secret treasures suited to operating within the starry sky."

"Brother-in-law, what's going on?" Su Mu shouted, bewildered.

Yang Kai sighed and recounted the events of his recent outing in full.

After hearing his account everyone was stunned. They were shocked by the Bone Clan's strangeness, and the Sacred Land elders showed unmistakeable dread.

"Saint Lord, you mean those beings called the Bone Clan are nothing but skeletons that can draw upon the essence of flesh and blood to fashion bodies?"

"Yes."

"And they can use large quantities of corpses and flesh, combined with medicinal materials, to create new clan members?"

"That's right!"

"The higher the quality of the materials, the stronger the beings they make?"

"They admit as much."

Everyone's hearts sank to the bottom of their stomachs.

From the intelligence they had so far, people seemed to envision a future where the Bone Clan would slaughter the living and dominate the Tongxuan Continent.

This race could sustain itself by war. There was no worry about numbers—so long as they slew enough masters, they could continuously spawn new members, and those newly born would provide them with tremendous power.

Someday, this world might well become the Bone Clan's.

This would be a calamity—a catastrophe for the whole continent!

"This is dire!" Xu Hui said gravely. "This must be reported to all of humanity."

"Even if we report it, how many will believe it?" Yu Ying asked with a worried face. The Bone Clan was so bizarre that, were it not for Yang Kai telling them, the elders might have dismissed it as madness.

"Whether they believe it or not will be proven in time. We will do what we can. I called you here today for this reason—assign people to notify the various powers and have them spread the word to one another. Use the Sacred Land's name as guarantee; tell them if they have doubts they can come to the Sacred Land to face me directly!"

"Yes!" the elders answered in turn.

Without hesitation they hurried out to make arrangements; they all understood the gravity of the matter. If the Bone Clan were not strangled in its cradle, once it grew strong it would be very difficult to deal with—perhaps the entire human race's forces would be insufficient.

After the elders left, Yang Kai looked at Li Rong and said, "You and Han Fei will come with me to the Demon Capital."

Li Rong shuddered slightly. "My lord has decided to go?"

"Yes. It seems something is hidden there; I intend to find out the truth."

"Very well!" Li Rong nodded decisively.

"I will go with you too!" A low voice came from outside the hall. Yang Kai's expression changed, and Ling Taixu turned sharply to look out.

Meng Wuya strode in from outside, face full of smiles, laughing, "Brother Ling, it's been more than ten years—how have you been?"

"Brother Meng!" Ling Taixu's face brightened; the two old friends, separated for over a decade, reunited with great emotion.

After Meng Wuya was brought back by Yang Kai, he had left again a few days later, and fighters from the Great Han had come here.

After a while of conversation, Yang Kai said, "Shopkeeper Meng, your return is perfectly timely."

"You're going to the Demon Capital?" Meng Wuya asked, turning his gaze to Yang Kai.

"Yes."

"I'll go with you. I want to know what secret is hidden there!" Meng Wuya's eyes flashed with determination. "Besides, I want to meet the Demon Lord. Last time I fell into his scheme and had my cultivation sealed—this time I want to see what he can do to me."

Yang Kai smiled wryly, "I'm not going there to make trouble for Changyuan."

Meng Wuya frowned. "You've already met him?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

“Be careful of him. Changyuan is a true overlord—don’t be fooled by that kindly face he usually wears. If he really makes a move against you, he will be ruthless."

"I know. Besides, with you coming along, I doubt Changyuan would dare try anything too reckless," Yang Kai said, feeling more at ease.

With Li Rong and Han Fei accompanying him, that was sufficient; now with Meng Wuya added, Changyuan would likely think twice before attempting any trickery.

"I hope he behaves himself," Meng Wuya snorted lightly.

"Shopkeeper Meng, where have you been for nearly a year?" Yang Kai asked.

"Gathering information, related to that Bone Clan you mentioned!" Meng Wuya's face grew serious. "But all I know is they came from beyond the stars, and their slumber has something to do with the Great Demon God. I don't know much else. I had planned to go alone to the Demon Capital to ask Changyuan, but now that you're going too, that's even better. I have a feeling that once we get there and unravel the secrets left by the Great Demon God, everything will become clear."

"I have the same feeling!" Yang Kai said, staring at him; they exchanged a knowing smile.

Moreover, Yang Kai held the key to breaking that restriction—the Wordless Black Book, the Demon God's Secret Codex Changyuan had spoken of!

The secrets left by the Great Demon God had troubled generations of Demon Lords; Changyuan himself was surely curious about them.

That Meng Wuya could even dig up some information about the Bone Clan impressed Yang Kai greatly.

He had heard it from the Bone Clan, but Meng Wuya must have used some method Yang Kai did not know.

Shopkeeper Meng's wide network made it unsurprising he could uncover some clues.

After staying two days at the Sacred Land to settle matters, Yang Kai set off for the Demon Capital with Meng Wuya, Li Rong and Han Fei.

Passing the Beast Sea Great Forest, Yang Kai stopped at Thundertree Palace to inform Great Lord Lei Long of the Bone Clan's revival, pointing out the stakes so he could prepare.

Lei Long listened and, though incredulous, chose to trust Yang Kai without reservation.

He solemnly promised to pass the news to the other two Great Lords of the yao and confer with them on how to handle it.

Yang Kai pressed on without delay toward the Demon Capital.

Crossing the entire Yao Realm, the four arrived at the Demon Domain in just a few days.

Feeling the malevolent demonic qi flowing through the land, Li Rong and Han Fei both looked refreshed. As heirs of the Ancient Demon Clan, this environment was more suited to their residence and cultivation; they had only remained at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land because they followed Yang Kai.

Indeed, the Demon Domain's environment was undoubtedly better for their living and training.

Even within the Demon Domain Yang Kai boldly guided the Star Shuttle, and at the Star Shuttle's speed, even if Demon Domain masters noticed them, they could not intercept them.

The Demon Domain's territory was smaller than humanity's lands but much larger than the Yao Realm; Meng Wuya knew the routes, so they did not delay to ask directions to the Demon Capital.

With leisure time, Yang Kai asked Meng Wuya about the great battle he once had with the Demon Lord.

Unexpectedly, Shopkeeper Meng grew angry and began to curse without restraint.

From his curses Yang Kai inferred that Meng Wuya had bravely gone alone to challenge the Demon Lord years ago, not knowing the Demon Capital hid a secret array. Changyuan had used the array's power to trap Meng Wuya and tormented him for three months before Meng Wuya fell prey to the Tianxuan Sealing Art.

Despite this, Meng Wuya had narrowly escaped catastrophe, though his cultivation dropped from the Third Stage of the Saint Realm to the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm.

After that he went into hiding, seeking a way to lift the seal.

Eventually he went to the Great Han and by chance found Xia Ningshang, who possessed the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body.
