## Chapter 1833 — All Was Heaven's Will in the Unseen

The Imperial Path, many Star Domains, the Domain Barrier, the guardians...

Many strange things assailed Yang Kai's mind, leaving him silent for a long time.

Yang Yan seemed to open a new door before him; light blazed within that portal, so dazzling it made Yang Kai's eyes ache, yet it quickened his blood and set his heart ablaze...

"By your account, the guardian of our Star Domain has been missing for tens of thousands of years — wouldn't that be a prize anyone could covet? Why, over all these years, has only the Insect Emperor ventured in?" After a long while Yang Kai raised his head and asked Yang Yan.

Yang Yan gave a light chuckle. "Do you think shattering the Domain Barrier is that simple? The Domain Barrier is a Law, and Law is supreme; even those ten top experts of old dared not touch it lightly. To break the Domain Barrier and descend here exacts a tremendous price!"

As she spoke, her dark brows knit tightly, as if some recollection had surfaced.

She paused, then continued, "In short, that price is not something everyone can bear. If one could personally comprehend the power of the Law, why risk coming to a Star Domain to refine the origin of a Cultivation Star? Only those whose cultivation has stagnated and whose realm is blocked would choose such a path. You must understand, once someone enters a Star Domain not their own, their realm can fall many levels; no expert would wish for that to happen to themselves."

"Even if their realm fell, they could still refine a Stellar Origin to peer into the Law?" Yang Kai exclaimed in astonishment.

As a martial artist, he naturally understood the agony of a drop in realm after having acquired great power. If he were at the Void King Realm today, a fall to the Origin Returning Realm or the Saint King Realm would be a devastating blow.

It would very likely send one into permanent decline, ending their martial path.

"Of course!" Yang Yan lifted her fair neck slightly. "You have not reached such a realm and cannot comprehend the lure that the power of Law holds for those people. A drop in realm can be recovered through cultivation, but mastering the Law is not so simple. You are the lord of the Dark Star and can vaguely sense some power of Law — that is your advantage. Every Star Lord has this advantage, and if they possess sufficient strength to shatter the void and travel to that place, they will become targets for every great power to court."

"That place... is it called the Star Realm?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at Yang Yan.

Yang Yan was taken aback. "How do you know that? I don't remember saying this to you..."

Mid-sentence her expression suddenly changed. "Who have you encountered?"

Yang Kai smiled wryly. "I did meet someone. That name, Star Realm, is what he called it."

Yang Kai then recounted in detail the matter with the Devouring Spirit Sect he had encountered on Tongxuan Continent.

After hearing it, Yang Yan snorted coldly. "So someone has descended again — truly courting death! The Devouring Spirit Array is such an evil formation that even in the Star Realm it is forbidden. It had long been sealed, yet someone still controlled it and brought it into this Star Domain."

“That formation was indeed quite impressive, and the Devouring Spirit Crystals refined from the world’s Spiritual Qi were rather ingenious as well, but they aren’t actually that effective, are they?” Yang Kai mused. “Absorbing Devouring Spirit Crystals to increase one’s strength can never compare to the benefits gained through one’s own cultivation. When I fought the Sect Master of the Devouring Spirit Sect, I noticed that although he was at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, his true combat strength was inferior to any other Void King Realm cultivator.”

"You think that person taught the Devouring Spirit Sect that secret art to increase their strength?" Yang Yan snorted. "He was merely testing — probing what reaction the guardians of this Star Domain would have. Until he has definite information, he will not act rashly. The Devouring Spirit Sect was merely a pawn he pushed onto the stage."

Yang Kai was stunned. "I heard the Devouring Spirit Sect suddenly rose a hundred years ago — does that mean that person arrived in this Star Domain a hundred years ago and has been patient until now?"

"Compared with one's life, a hundred years is nothing."

"True enough. Your long slumber spanned tens of thousands of years..." Yang Kai reflected, and it no longer seemed strange; plotting for a century was trivial compared to Yang Yan's dormancy.

"Lower your Divine Sense defenses; I will enter and see what that fellow left in your Sea of Consciousness. If possible, I will personally find him — consider it the last thing this Lord does for you before leaving this Star Domain."

"Very well!" Yang Kai nodded slightly.

The next moment he immersed his mind and opened the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness.

He had no reason to distrust Yang Yan; though this encounter felt different from before, Yang Kai still discovered many familiar things.

A coolness brushed his Sea of Consciousness and a beautiful apparition eerily appeared beside Yang Kai — the spirit body of Yang Yan.

She looked him over from side to side and showed an approving expression. "Your spirit power truly differs from ordinary people; it likely reached the level of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and your Divine Sense is a mutated fire type... Hm? A Warm Spirit Lotus? A seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus?"

She suddenly cried out, covering her small mouth with her hand, her beautiful eyes trembling as if she had seen something incredible. "You actually possess a seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus?"

This was her first time entering Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, and upon seeing the Warm Spirit Lotus she was stunned.

It truly was the Warm Spirit Lotus in its seven-colored form; iridescent light blossomed from it and she felt her spirit purified, an ease sweeping through her.

"Is that thing of great value? Why does everyone react like that when they see it?" Yang Kai touched his nose; the unnamed expert who had seen the Warm Spirit Lotus a few days earlier had reacted almost identically to Yang Yan.

"Of great value?" Yang Yan glanced at Yang Kai. "This Heaven-and-Earth treasure's worth is simply incalculable. As its owner you can feel the benefits it brings; I need not say more, right?"

Yang Kai nodded.

"No wonder your Divine Sense is so much stronger than an ordinary martial artist's — you have had a Warm Spirit Lotus nurturing it all along! And this is the seven-colored form of the Warm Spirit Lotus; your luck is truly extraordinary." Yang Yan showed a hint of envy and solemnly warned Yang Kai, "Even in the Star Realm the Warm Spirit Lotus is legendary and few have seen it. If you ever go to the Star Realm, you must never let others know of this secret."

"I understand. Only my closest few know that I possess a Warm Spirit Lotus," Yang Kai said, nodding.

Hearing him say that, a flicker of emotion flashed through Yang Yan’s eyes, but it vanished in an instant as she regained her usual composure. She said calmly, “Enough. In a moment, I will impart to you a secret Divine Soul technique. Once you cultivate it, you’ll be able to seal your own Sea of Consciousness. Combined with the restriction I’ll place, unless someone’s cultivation reaches my level, they won’t be able to invade your Sea of Consciousness. The restriction will not harm you—in fact, as your strength grows, it will gradually dissolve on its own.”

"Thank you then." Yang Kai gave a small laugh.

Yang Yan glanced at him, then turned her head to look around. When her gaze reached the sky, the host of stars impressed themselves in her eyes and she froze, murmuring, "Star Chart?"

"Oh, I obtained that when I first came to this Star Domain by chance," Yang Kai explained casually, examining Yang Yan's expression closely.

Yang Yan's face became strange upon seeing the Star Chart; she seemed to grow somewhat desolate, as if some precious thing had been lost, sorrow etched across her lovely features.

Yang Kai did not understand; the unnamed man had been clearly excited upon seeing the Star Chart, more so even than when he saw the Warm Spirit Lotus. Why would Yang Yan...

"The Star Chart actually appears here!" Yang Yan closed her beautiful eyes and stood motionless.

Yang Kai did not dare disturb her and waited quietly.

After a long while, Yang Yan slowly opened her eyes and let out a soft sigh. “Yang Kai, the guardian of this Star Domain—there’s no one more suited for that role than you.”

Yang Kai frowned. "Don't joke. What can my strength possibly guard? Though I do not know what experts dwell in the Star Realm, I know for sure they are far beyond what I can contend with."

"You cannot escape it, because the Star Chart is with you — it belongs to the guardian!" Yang Yan turned to look at him.

"What do you mean?"

Yang Yan spoke softly, "A Cultivation Star has its own Stellar Origin; a martial artist who refines it can become the Star Lord and guard that Cultivation Star. In other words, the Star Lord is also the guardian to that star. The same principle applies to a Star Domain — it has its origin, which is the Star Chart!"

As she spoke she pointed to the heavens. "Only by refining the Stellar Origin of the Star Chart can one qualify as the guardian of a Star Domain. And now the Star Chart is with you. Do you think you can run away?"

Yang Kai was stunned. "This thing is the origin of the entire Star Domain? Come on, I always used it just to find directions — I never noticed any other use."

Yang Yan only looked at him, her expression serious.

"Are you serious?" Yang Kai's face changed slightly.

"How could I joke about such a matter?" Yang Yan said with some feeling. "It seems Heaven's will threads through all things. You have the Star Chart and that man's Xuan Realm Pearl, and you have cultivated spatial power as he did — it seems you are truly to inherit that fellow's legacy. The reason you have failed to perceive the Star Chart's marvel is simply lack of strength. When you reach my level you will appreciate the Star Chart's preciousness; it is something countless people desire yet cannot obtain."

"You mean that man was the previous guardian of this Star Domain?"

"Correct."

"Then where is he now?"

"Wherever he is, the chart is here. The Star Chart is with you — where else would he be?" Yang Yan looked Yang Kai straight in the eye.

"Dead?" Yang Kai exclaimed in alarm.

"Who knows?" Yang Yan sneered with a hint of disappointment. "He liked to roam between the void rifts; perhaps the void has swallowed him long ago — his misdeeds caught up to him, deservedly so!"
