## Chapter 1670 — Yingyue Hall's Crisis

As the Great Elder of Yingyue Hall, Qian Tong had held immense prestige within the sect for many years. The old Hall Master had long been in seclusion, seeking to comprehend the supreme mysteries of the Void King Realm, so within Yingyue Hall, Qian Tong’s position was virtually that of a vice-Hall Master.

Moreover, his cultivation is very high, and Xie Chen has always been extremely wary of him.

Now, at the sudden appearance of Qian Tong, Xie Chen instinctively took a few steps back, his face showing some panic.

But very quickly he halted, his expression turning fierce and ruthless.

Indeed, ten years ago he truly wasn't Qian Tong's match—after all he was a Stage below in cultivation—but now...

He dispelled that deep-rooted fear of Qian Tong in his heart, replacing it with eager anticipation.

"Oh? Home at last?" Qian Tong stepped out of the vortex, and at a glance saw Tianyun City not far off; he laughed heartily, "Finally home — I was far too bored in that damned place."

Although the Xuan Realm Pearl was peaceful and its Spiritual Qi abundant, it still lacked something, and Qian Tong did not quite adapt to it.

Now back in his homeland and once more before Tianyun City, Qian Tong was in high spirits.

"Well, well, well. Chang'er, Xuan'er, long time no see — your cultivation has improved nicely; you're even about to advance to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm... Hm? How did you get injured?" Qian Tong's face darkened, thunderous anger showing: "Who hurt you?"

He still did not fully understand the situation at hand.

Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er stared at Qian Tong in a daze, unable to regain themselves; after a long while the two of them suddenly fell to their knees at Qian Tong's feet with a thud.

"Elder Qian, your disciples have failed the trust you placed in us; we did not protect Yingyue Hall. Please punish us!" Wei Guchang pressed his forehead to the ground, his voice trembling in a guttural roar.

"Master, punish me!" Dong Xuan'er also bowed to the ground, softly sobbing.

Even when facing enemies several times their strength, even facing death, the two fellow disciples had never furrowed their brows. But now, upon seeing Qian Tong, their resolute will finally crumbled, like wronged children seeing their parent.

Qian Tong now sensed that something was amiss; his gaze swept coldly around. He paused briefly on Xie Chen, vaguely suspicious, but did not immediately press the matter — instead he reached out, helped Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er to their feet, and said in a deep voice, "Get up and speak — Yingyue Hall... what happened?"

Qian Tong's expression was calm, but like the eve of a storm it caused an inexplicable, crushing oppression to settle over the world.

"Yingyue Hall... has been destroyed," Wei Guchang answered, grief-stricken.

"Destroyed?" Qian Tong's face darkened. "By whom? Tell me everything in detail."

"Yes!" Wei Guchang nodded respectfully, and then proceeded to recount the calamity that had befallen Yingyue Hall step by step.

Two years ago the entire Dark Star suddenly underwent a massive upheaval: a strange, miraculous force surfaced and began brutally suppressing the great sects and noble families on Dark Star; those who refused to submit were hunted to the death. In an instant the whole Dark Star was drenched in blood — countless cities were reduced to ruins overnight, hundreds of millions of lives perished, wails filled the plains, corpses heaped into mountains, and blood flowed in rivers.

Before long, the claws of that mysterious force reached out toward Yingyue Hall; faced with such evil might, the higher ranks of Yingyue Hall did not know how to respond.

Yingyue Hall had long been divided into two factions — this was already evident back when Qian Tong still resided on Dark Star — and in the face of crisis that division only deepened.

In the end the pro-submission faction led by Xie Chen achieved victory.

Xie Chen and his followers ambushed the old Hall Master and some of the high-ranking members of the pro-war faction, leaving Yingyue Hall grievously wounded and torn apart.

In a single night Yingyue Hall changed hands, and Xie Chen became the new Hall Master, pledging fealty to that mysterious force.

Those who had once supported and stood with Qian Tong among the high ranks were almost exterminated; Fei Zhi Tu, who was in Tianyun City, was also taken prisoner.

Only a few elites managed to flee; on the eve of the incident Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er were summoned by the perceptive old Hall Master and told to leave with the ancestral treasure — the Heavenly Moon Silver Plate.

For the past two years the two of them have hidden their names and wandered east and west, living in extreme hardship.

The reason they appeared near Tianyun City this time was precisely to attempt to rescue Fei Zhi Tu.

Xie Chen had spread word that today he would publicly behead the unyielding Fei Zhi Tu in Tianyun City as a warning, so Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er had no choice but to show themselves.

Even though they knew it was a trap, the two of them leapt into it without hesitation.

"The old Hall Master is dead! Old Fei imprisoned?" Qian Tong's face was as dark as a thundercloud; anyone could clearly feel his sky-reaching fury.

"What of Lingxiao Sect?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice. "Yingyue Hall has suffered this calamity — did Lingxiao Sect send no aid?"

If Lingxiao Sect truly offered no help, that would be deeply disappointing.

When Yang Kai fell into misfortune previously, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu had helped him many times; Fei Zhi Tu's fall in status was partly connected to Yang Kai as well.

But on second thought, with Ye Xijun stationed in Lingxiao Sect, given her temperament she would not sit idly by.

"Lingxiao Sect did send aid. Many of the disciples who escaped Yingyue Hall have been taken into Lingxiao Sect for refuge. Great Elder Ye also dispatched several Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts — however..."

"However what?"

"However they were no match; several died and were forced to withdraw," Wei Guchang said with a dim expression.

"What?" Yang Kai was terrified.

Even Qian Tong wore an expression of disbelief.

The Origin Returning Realm fighters sent by Lingxiao Sect must have been strong experts from Star Emperor Mountain. How could even they be no match, and how could several of them die?

Yingyue Hall could never possess such overwhelming strength!

"That Corpse Spirit Sect abounds with strong fighters; rumor has it they even have four Void King Realm experts in their ranks. The Lingxiao Sect people were struck down by one of those Void King Realm experts," Wei Guchang explained.

The Corpse Spirit Sect — that is the name of the newly risen, mysterious force.

"Impossible!" Qian Tong looked unconvinced.

Yang Kai was also stunned.

Void King Realm experts have appeared on Dark Star? And four of them at once?

How could that be?

This place has wondrous heavenly rules that suppress such births — for tens of thousands of years no Void King Realm experts have been born here; if that were not the case, Qian Tong and the others would not have sailed off with Yang Kai.

Yet now Wei Guchang claims there are four Void King Realm experts on Dark Star; no one could accept that lightly.

"I only heard this by word of mouth. I don't know the true situation," Wei Guchang said despondently, then, as if recalling something, added, "By the way, Great Elder Ye should be aware."

"How so?" Yang Kai's expression shifted.

"It is rumored that Great Elder Ye once encountered two of those four and fought a fierce battle. She was gravely injured and retreated back to Lingxiao Sect, where she is still recuperating."

Ye Xijun is gravely injured!

That was extremely bad news.

Yet Yang Kai and Qian Tong exchanged a glance and deduced some useful information.

Those four rumored figures should not actually be Void King Realm experts; otherwise Ye Xijun, when faced with two of them, could not possibly have escaped with her life — any one of them could have killed her with ease.

In fact, Ye Xijun only escaped by fleeing while grievously wounded.

However, the opponents' strength was indeed not to be underestimated. Ye Xijun's cultivation at the Origin Returning Realm had reached its limit — had she been willing to leave Dark Star, she might well have become a Void King Realm expert by now. The fact that the opponents dispatched only two to injure her suggests they are of the same level as Ye Xijun, or possibly even superior.

Yang Kai and Qian Tong's expressions shifted continuously as they quietly processed the information Wei Guchang had conveyed.

Who would have thought that after being away seven or eight years such a vast upheaval could have occurred on Dark Star? What on earth is this Corpse Spirit Sect? Why had it been obscure before, then suddenly burst onto the scene?

"Brother Yang needn't worry about Lingxiao Sect. Present-day Lingxiao Sect can be regarded as the last pure land of the entire Dark Star. Although its outskirts are besieged on all sides, no one can penetrate it," Wei Guchang said, seeing Yang Kai's sour expression and hastening to reassure him.

"I know that," Yang Kai nodded.

Yang Kai was not worried for Lingxiao Sect's safety — outside Lingxiao Sect are two Three Flames Rings guarding it; those are Imperial Treasures, and even a Void King Realm expert could not breach the Three Flames Ring's defenses.

"Many who refuse to submit seek to flee into Lingxiao Sect, but..." Wei Guchang sighed.

He and Dong Xuan'er had intended to enter Lingxiao Sect back then, but the enemies at the outskirts were simply too many; they had no chance, and these past two years they had only been able to hide and survive in hardship.

"Has the idle talk concluded?" Suddenly a sinister voice sounded from the side.

Xie Chen!

He had been watching coldly from the side without striking or stopping Wei Guchang from speaking, and it was only at this moment that he spoke.

Qian Tong turned his head toward him; his expression was icy and his gaze like a blade.

Xie Chen's heart lurched; he forced himself calm and sneered, "Great Elder Qian, long time no see!"

"Xie Chen!" Qian Tong took a deep breath. "It seems I was far too merciful back then. I thought that, being of the same Yingyue Hall lineage, internal slaughter would only weaken Yingyue Hall, so when the Xie Family rebelled I spared you — I never imagined that past mercy would lead to today's disaster. This Qian cannot escape blame!"

"Hahaha!" Xie Chen laughed madly. "Qian Tong, facing death and still spouting empty words! Who do you think you are? True, you once made me wary — you had the means to kill me. But since you did not, you have no chance now. Today I am a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator and the Hall Master of Yingyue Hall; you are no match for me! Qian Tong, in light of your past merits to Yingyue Hall, this Hall Master can spare you — provided you are willing to submit to the Corpse Spirit Sect. I might even restore you to your Great Elder post!"

Qian Tong looked at him coldly, as if looking at a vainglorious clown; the mockery and contempt in his eyes were plain to see.

Yang Kai was even amused by Xie Chen.

Xie Chen had only recently advanced a few years ago to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and yet dares to challenge the present Qian Tong — he truly seems not to know the meaning of death.
