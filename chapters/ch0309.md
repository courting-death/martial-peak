## Chapter 309 — If You Don't Believe, Come and See for Yourself

In a state of anxiety, it was unclear what Bai Yunfeng was thinking when he suddenly shouted, “Yang Kai, I won’t let you off even if I become a ghost!”

“What are you going crazy for!” Yang Kai retorted, extremely annoyed.

“Hehe…” Bai Yunfeng let out a bitter laugh, his voice sharp as he said, “If it weren't for you breaking through the ground, how could we have fallen here and been caught by this group of spiders?”

“If I hadn’t broken through the ground, you would have been killed by Gu Yuanming and his people long ago. Would you still be alive now?” Yang Kai sneered, realizing that Bai Yunfeng might be a bit out of his mind.

“I am from the Bai Family; do those trash dare to kill me?” Bai Yunfeng roared, “As long as I reveal my true identity, they will only take me to the Bai Family to seek rewards, how could they harm my life?”

“You might not have to die, but if Miss Qiu and Miss Luo fall into their hands, heh, their innocence might not be preserved. I think they would rather be trapped in a spider web than be caught by those people.”

“Their innocence has nothing to do with me; I just want to live!” Bai Yunfeng shouted angrily, speaking without thinking.

As soon as the words left his mouth, he seemed to realize he shouldn’t have said such things and suddenly fell silent, brooding in silence.

“Bai Yunfeng… I didn’t expect you to think like this.” Luo Xiaoman’s voice came through, filled with deep disappointment and disgust.

A woman’s innocence is sometimes more important than life itself. If she were truly captured by the martial artists of Cangyun Evil Land, Luo Xiaoman would rather end her life than suffer humiliation.

Qiu Yimeng said lightly, “People are not for themselves; heaven and earth will punish them. Xiaoman, don’t take it to heart!”

Her voice was calm, revealing no emotions.

“Cowardly and afraid of death, people from the Bai Family are indeed spineless!” Luo Xiaoman mocked.

“I can’t be bothered to talk to you.” Bai Yunfeng mumbled, feeling a rift had formed between him and the two women. Although it wasn’t to the point of drawing blades against each other, even if they managed to escape, it was unlikely they would walk together again.

Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo exchanged glances, both at a loss for words.

After a long silence, Yang Kai furrowed his brow and said, “If you want to leave, you can go now, right? The Spider Mother doesn’t seem inclined to keep you.”

Shan Qingluo slowly shook her head. “But it won’t let you go.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned strange as he scrutinized her seriously. He hesitated and said, “Our friendship doesn’t seem to be at that level. Just like Qiu Yimeng said, people are not for themselves; heaven and earth will punish them.”

Shan Qingluo merely smiled at him.

“You can’t be serious, right?” Yang Kai’s heart stirred slightly.

“I’ve said it before, women from the Poison Widow lineage only fall for one man in their lifetime. Do you think I’m lying to you?” Shan Qingluo sighed softly, “If it weren’t for you leaving your aura in my Sea of Consciousness last time, I wouldn’t care whether you lived or died. You little rascal, so lecherous and rogue, you should have been killed long ago to prevent you from ruining the innocence of those girls. But now, what can I do?”

Unless Shan Qingluo didn’t want her cultivation to reach fruition! The seed of love had already taken root in her heart, and it was only a matter of time before it grew.

When the seed of love matured, it would require a night of union with the man she loved.

Moreover, women from the Poison Widow lineage, once they fell in love, experienced feelings more profound than other women.

Thus, this lineage of women was always marked by extreme sorrow.

On one side was unwavering love until death, and on the other was the completion of their cultivation.

Even if they sacrificed their cultivation for love, they could not resist the attraction and temptation between them.

Shan Qingluo’s mother, Han Feiyan, had one night inadvertently shared intimacy with her father, and when she woke up, her beloved lay dead beside her, leaving her in pain for a lifetime.

Yang Kai’s expression grew serious as he stared deeply into Shan Qingluo’s eyes, as if trying to penetrate her heart and see into the depths of her memories.

Shan Qingluo smiled slightly, unreservedly releasing the defenses of her Sea of Consciousness, and softly said, “If you don’t believe, come and see for yourself!”

Yang Kai did not hesitate, directly sending his Divine Sense into her Sea of Consciousness.

An endless ocean spread out before him, resembling what he had seen last time.

Above the sea, Shan Qingluo’s delicate figure stood against the wind, smiling as she watched Yang Kai’s Divine Sense, softly saying, “Don’t touch me; this is my soul. If you do, the consequences will be unimaginable.”

“I know.” Yang Kai replied solemnly.

If their souls merged, they might experience a connection far more wonderful than the merging of their physical bodies. However, if their minds were unstable, they would lose themselves in the process and become fools in an instant.

Yang Kai was well aware of the stakes involved.

With a wave of her delicate hand, Shan Qingluo sent beams of light into Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

Peering into the information contained within these beams, Yang Kai comprehended all of this enchantress’s emotional experiences and thoughts without any reservations or concealments.

He also saw the peculiarities of her lineage and the dangers of her cultivation method, and he became aware of his future fate.

Scenes flashed before his eyes, vivid as if he had experienced them himself.

After a long time, Yang Kai slowly withdrew from her Sea of Consciousness.

Their eyes met, and Shan Qingluo laughed, “Now do you believe?”

Yang Kai nodded gravely, never expecting the cultivation method of this enchantress to be so unique.

With a wry smile, Yang Kai said, “Should I say I’m honored or should I say I’m unlucky?”

It was true that she had feelings for him, but in the end, it could cost him his life.

Shan Qingluo’s expression dimmed slightly as she said softly, “Women from our lineage never truly want to kill the man they like. But this attraction is fundamentally irresistible. Even if they are far apart, they can draw each other closer, and in chaos and unconsciousness, they might kill the man they fancy with their innocent bodies!”

Though it is said that dying under a peony flower is a romantic way to go, when the time comes, no man would likely die with a smile.

“Have you never thought about resolving this?”

“Of course, but we don’t know how to do it.” Shan Qingluo slowly shook her head.

“Forget it. Let’s not talk about this for now.” Yang Kai said, feeling somewhat disinterested and not wanting to continue.

“Mm.”

“Since you don’t want to leave me behind, let’s think of a way to escape from here first.”

“Let’s wait until the Spider Mother wakes up in five days, and I’ll talk to it then.”

“What if it doesn’t work?” Yang Kai frowned.

“If it doesn’t work, then I’ll just leave.” Shan Qingluo smiled, showing no signs of worry.

Yang Kai’s gaze flickered as he softly asked, “If you could restore all your strength, could you leave here?”

“Of course I could leave.” Shan Qingluo nodded. “But right now, I’m only at the Third Stage of True Yuan. It will take at least a few months to fully recover.”

“I might have a way.” Yang Kai grinned, having gleaned many of Shan Qingluo’s thoughts and feeling more at ease.

This enchantress, despite her wild reputation and the unsightly treasures she used, was actually quite innocent before meeting him.

She understood matters of men and women better than most, yet she had never practiced them herself.

“What method do you have?” Shan Qingluo asked curiously.

Yang Kai extended a hand, holding a small piece of Wan Yao Ling Paste, and said, “Open your mouth!”

Shan Qingluo shot him a glance, unsure of what he was up to, but still opened her delicate lips.

The Wan Yao Ling Paste was directly tossed in.

“Cultivate and refine it!” 

Without needing Yang Kai to say more, the moment the Wan Yao Ling Paste entered, Shan Qingluo’s expression turned astonished, and she quickly closed her eyes, operating her cultivation method.

Her strength had declined primarily due to the backlash of her cultivation method, which was essentially an internal injury.

With a small piece of Wan Yao Ling Paste to assist, this injury should be recoverable.

The Spider Mother would awaken again in five days, and with the help of Wan Yao Ling Paste, Shan Qingluo would definitely recover in less time than that.

With nothing else to do, Yang Kai also conserved his energy.

As time passed, the momentum and True Yuan fluctuations emanating from Shan Qingluo grew increasingly intense, clearly indicating she was recovering rapidly.

Noticing the changes, Qiu Yimeng, who had been silent, suddenly raised her head to look over, her beautiful eyes flickering, her expression slightly struggling, as if she were lost in thought.

Having been trapped for so many days, her strength had long since recovered, but with so many Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts outside, even if she could break through the spider web, she dared not act rashly.

Shan Qingluo’s movements undoubtedly gave her a glimmer of hope.

However, recalling the conditions she had previously proposed, Qiu Yimeng felt somewhat indecisive.

After all, she was the young lady of the Qiu Family; how could she serve a nameless junior as a maid? Not to mention her, even Luo Xiaoman’s status was far nobler than that of that man. If this were to spread, how would the Qiu Family and Ziwei Valley save face?

Moreover, it was for a year; who knew what that rogue would do in that time?

Three days later.

Shan Qingluo suddenly opened her eyes, her watery gaze sparkling, and her soft, plump body seemed to harbor terrifying power.

“Recovered?” Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

“Mm.” Shan Qingluo nodded with joy, looking at Yang Kai with great interest, “I didn’t expect you to have such a treasure.”

She praised him and then reached out to pinch Yang Kai’s chest, twisting it hard while gritting her silver teeth, “With such a good thing, why didn’t you use it for me before? You rascal, you really have been wary of me.”

Yang Kai’s expression turned awkward as he forced a laugh.

If he hadn’t seen into her thoughts, how would Yang Kai have dared to let this enchantress recover her strength?

“Now that you’ve recovered, let’s hurry and leave.” Yang Kai grasped her small hand.

Shan Qingluo hesitated for a moment and said, “Since I’ve come here with great difficulty, I want to take some of the Spider Mother’s venom as well. Otherwise, if I take you away this time, it will definitely anger the Spider Mother, and I won’t be able to come back again.”

“Are you confident?”

“A little bit. Did you control a spider?”

“Mm.”

“Have it create some chaos.”

“Alright!” Yang Kai nodded and then issued a command to the spider he controlled.
