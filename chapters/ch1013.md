## Chapter 1013 — We Are Very Sorry

On the flat stretch halfway up the mountain, Purple Star and a contingent from the Sword Alliance watched on edge, every person holding their breath; not a single voice dared break the silence. The wide area was so quiet one could hear a pin drop — the atmosphere heavy and taut.

They had no idea how much time had passed when Yang Kai suddenly shuddered, his face going pale as if he had encountered something unimaginably terrifying.

The Void Passage that had been opened by the spatial array began to writhe and close like a beast's gaping maw; in the blink of an eye the black corridor of void vanished and the warped space at the mountainside returned to normal.

The instant the Void Passage sealed, Yang Kai's Soul Incarnation and the vengeful spirit the Ghost Ancestor had released both shot out of the corridor as if fleeing for their lives.

The Ghost Ancestor waved a hand and that vengeful spirit was drawn back into him; Yang Kai retracted his Soul Incarnation as well, did a quick check and his face hardened like water. “Senior, my Soul Incarnation can't be used again — it's on the verge of collapse.”

The Ghost Ancestor seemed occupied examining the feedback from that vengeful spirit and didn't pay Yang Kai immediate attention. After a while he nodded and said, “Mm, you did well. Recover and go.”

“Senior, if this happens again next time, you won't call on me, will you?” Yang Kai asked coldly.

The Ghost Ancestor grinned, “Depends on my mood, and whether you behave, kid.”

Yang Kai's expression darkened; without another word he flew back and sat down beside Shen Tu.

“Carry on with your tasks; don’t wander too far. I’ll call for you if I need you,” the Ghost Ancestor said in a measured tone.

Hearing that, everyone felt as if a huge burden had been lifted, and they hurriedly dispersed, fleeing from that mountainside flat as if escaping a disaster.

Yang Kai and Shen Tu hurried down the mountain as well, both eager to leave that cursed place and not willing to linger another moment.

In short order only the Ghost Ancestor remained on the mountainside. He stared at the spatial array he had poured immense effort into arranging, his face bleak as he frowned in thought, considering how to adjust the formation so it would function with precision.

Although this attempt had failed, he had mentally prepared for it and did not appear too disappointed.

After all, when he first came here, he had only just broken through to the Saint King Realm, and his attainments were far from profound. Being able to spend a thousand years to devise this Space Array could already be considered quite fortunate.

Yet the mysteries of space were not something he could fully fathom; even now at the height of the Void King Realm, the secrets of space remained intricate and unfathomable.

Such matters required both talent and opportunity!

He sat at the center of the great formation and soon began moving the Saint Crystals again, redrawing the array's diagrams.

Ten li from the peak Yang Kai halted his steps and stopped.

“What's wrong? Keep running,” Shen Tu said, surprised, urging him on.

“Where do you think you can run to?” Yang Kai looked at him with a strange expression.

“I don't know — as far as I can!” Shen Tu shivered. “I don't want him to lock onto me and drag me into that corridor where life and death are beyond control!”

Yang Kai shook his head. “Here, he's the master of everything. No matter where you run he'll be able to find you.”

“That's true,” Shen Tu conceded after some thought, nodding. “Still, brother, sorry about earlier — I really couldn't help you.”

“It's fine. I did something that drew his attention,” Yang Kai said. He understood why the Ghost Ancestor had singled him out first: it was clearly because he had slain Wei Wu.

He felt he had defied the Ghost Ancestor's orders and that he had not been sufficiently obedient.

It had nothing to do with Shen Tu, and even if Shen Tu wanted to help, under the Ghost Ancestor's overwhelming dominance there was little he could do.

“What did you encounter in that Void Passage?” Shen Tu asked curiously.

“I’m not entirely sure. My Soul Incarnation had no will of its own; although I attached a sliver of Divine Sense, it didn't observe much. All I can tell you is this: with the Ghost Ancestor's study of spatial law… whoever enters that place dies! My Soul Incarnation escaped only because it had no physical form — the speed of a spirit is not something a body can match.”

Shen Tu went pale. “Then what’s he still researching it for?”

“He's been trapped here for two thousand years and naturally wants to leave. Yet this place is a genuine Sacred Land for cultivation for us. The reason he could rise to the Void King Realm here is inseparable from the training environment.” Yang Kai drew in a breath and smiled wryly. “You should be glad he still has things to study. If one day he loses interest in spatial arrays and decides escape is impossible… that will be the real catastrophe.”

“Brother, don’t scare me!” Shen Tu's face showed terror; the image in his mind chilled him to the bone.

If the Ghost Ancestor ever gave up on researching the array and resigned himself to never escaping, given his temperament and character, everyone here might be worse off than dead.

“What are you going to do next?” Yang Kai asked him.

“I don’t know — wait to die?” Shen Tu's mouth twitched. “And you?”

“Find a place to seclude and cultivate,” Yang Kai answered casually.

Shen Tu was surprised and couldn't understand why Yang Kai remained so calm, showing no sign of worry.

After thinking a moment he said, “I’ll find something to do too. Ugh, living on edge like this is unbearable!”

On this continent only he and Yang Kai could converse easily; the people of the Sword Alliance and Purple Star formed their own groups and naturally would not bother them. Now that Yang Kai planned to go into seclusion, Shen Tu lost the only person he could talk to and felt a pang of dissatisfaction.

For reasons unknown he felt inferior to Yang Kai, even though his strength was clearly much higher — a gnawing sense of being outmatched.

Yang Kai seemed remarkably composed in any situation; when circumstances slipped beyond his control he would quietly observe until he could take control.

Shen Tu couldn't help but admire him.

After a bit more idle chatter the two parted ways.

Yang Kai didn't know what Shen Tu planned to do; he himself intended to go to the cave where he had previously refined pills.

Strength at any time is a guarantee of survival! Yang Kai understood this more clearly than anyone.

Because of Lü Guichen's restraints, he could not increase his strength for two months, and he did not want to waste this rare training environment. He was almost impatient to start.

“Senior, I want to cultivate and refine pills in the cave where you found me before. Is that acceptable?” Just to be safe, Yang Kai sent out a Divine Sense message to ask the Ghost Ancestor.

After a moment the Ghost Ancestor's voice sounded in his ear: “Go. I don’t need you for now.”

“Thanks!” Yang Kai nodded, summoned the Star Shuttle and flew in that direction.

He had not gone far when a sharp feminine call came from the side, “Yang Kai!”

Yang Kai halted and turned toward the voice to see the two He sisters flying toward him from not far off.

In a moment the two sisters arrived before him.

He Zao's expression was complicated, as if she didn't know how to begin; He Miao, however, asked bluntly, “Senior Brother Wei Wu was really killed by you?”

“What do you think?” Yang Kai asked in return without answering.

“I don't think it's possible!” He Miao scoffed. “Senior Brother Wei Wu reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, bearing all of Master’s true teachings. You're so weak — how could you have killed him?”

“Am I that weak?” Yang Kai said, astonished.

He Miao sized him up, sweeping him with Divine Sense and giggled, “Anyway, you're not strong. I think I could defeat you easily.”

“Is that so…” Yang Kai nodded slightly and didn't argue, asking instead, “Did you come to see me for something?”

He Zao spoke softly, “We came to apologize.”

She bit her lip, looking apologetic. “You saved our lives in the Chaos Abyss. We should have properly thanked you, but Master—”

“It's not your fault,” Yang Kai said with a smile, unconcerned.

“Anyway… we are very sorry. And Master is furious about Senior Brother Wei Wu's death. She told us to find a chance to kill you, Yang Kai. If one day we sisters really draw swords against you, please don't blame us — it's not our will.”

Yang Kai grinned, “I understand. But if you truly try, be mentally prepared to be killed by me. I won't let you attack me and just take it.”

“You're so arrogant…” He Miao snorted. “If we sisters really tried to kill you, could you resist?”

“Try me and you'll see!”

“He Miao, don't be so rude,” He Zao chided lightly.

“Okay.” He Miao stuck out her tongue playfully.

“All settled then?” Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at them.

“Nothing else. We just came to tell you this.”

“Farewell then.” Yang Kai once more used the Star Shuttle, but as he prepared to leave he frowned and asked, “Tell me this — if you two died in the Chaos Abyss, what good would it do Wei Wu?”

“What do you mean?” He Zao looked at him, puzzled and wary.

Yang Kai chuckled, “Just asking.”

He Zao furrowed her brows in thought and said seriously, “Master belongs to the Sword Alliance and hasn’t taken many disciples. Among them, my sister, Senior Brother Wei Wu, and I are considered the more promising ones. If we were to die, Master would surely devote all her effort to nurturing him.”

“Then how did you get lost in the Chaos Abyss?” Yang Kai asked again.

“Senior Brother Wei Wu sent us a message to wait outside the Chaos Abyss, but we ran into a group from Purple Star. We were outnumbered and forced… forced to…” He Zao's face suddenly changed as she thought of something; her body trembled and she looked at Yang Kai incredulously.

“Farewell!” Yang Kai said little else; his form wrapped in a green rainbow and in a blink he was gone.

He Zao stood there deep in thought, her pretty face twisted in anger, while He Miao wore an expression of bewilderment.

After a long while He Miao muttered softly, “This person is really strange — he says all sorts of nonsensical things.”

“I think he's smarter than anyone,” He Zao's eyes shone with a different light. “And you underestimate him. If he could kill Senior Brother Wei Wu, there's definitely more to it than meets the eye. Perhaps… he doesn't even consider the two of us worth noticing.”

“No way, sister, aren't you overestimating him?” He Miao cried out.

“Do you remember when we met him in the Chaos Abyss? He didn't dodge; he had no idea who we were or whether we intended him harm, yet he still waited in place. That means he believes that even if we had malicious intent, his strength alone could handle it,” He Zao murmured low.
