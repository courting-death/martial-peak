## Chapter 1120 — Strike the Snake, Yet It Lives

The two emerged from that concealed burrow. Yang Flame tugged at Yang Kai and said, "Wait a moment — I’ll set up an array to hide this place."

"All right."

Yang Flame was not only adept at refining artifacts, she was also skilled in arrays — a talent far beyond someone half‑baked like Yang Kai. She withdrew all manner of materials from her Spatial Ring, used her power to forge them, then arranged what she had made at the cave entrance in a seemingly chaotic but actually orderly pattern.

When she finished arranging them, the cave mouth suddenly vanished; it could not be seen with the naked eye, and even probing with Divine Sense made detection difficult.

Yang Flame patted her hands in satisfaction. "Just remember this spot. Next time come straight down from here."

Yang Kai was also quite pleased with her work. Although he might not come back, it was better to prevent anyone from accidentally finding the burrow — if news that this place held a large amount of Ethereal Crystal leaked out, the whole Dark Star would likely be stirred into uproar.

Since ancient times wealth has moved hearts; no one would ignore such a precious ore as Ethereal Crystal.

The two headed toward where the cave was. Before they reached it, Yang Kai’s expression changed — he saw Yu Feng running over for some reason, looking anxious as he paced near the cave as if searching for him.

Yang Kai quickened his pace and soon stood before Yu Feng, calling out, "Brother Yu!"

"Yang Kai!" Yu Feng had been like a headless fly, unable to find Yang Kai. Hearing the call, he was overjoyed. "Where did you run off to? I searched all over Dragon Lair Mountain and couldn’t find you — I thought you’d already gone."

Yang Kai chuckled, "I just went out for a walk with Yang Flame. If I were leaving, I’d let Wu Yi know. I wouldn’t slip away without telling anyone."

Yu Feng shook his head and cut him off, speaking seriously, "Are you really going to leave now?"

Yang Kai frowned. "What do you mean? Has something happened?"

He knew Wu Yi wouldn’t drive him away. Wu Yi had a grand dream; it was because of that dream she had kept him, had temporarily given Dragon Lair Mountain as a place for him to stay, and she had come by several times these days. She’d treated him well.

But since Yu Feng had come, he must be acting on Wu Yi’s behalf. If there weren’t some emergency, she wouldn’t have done this.

Yang Kai immediately remembered that he had killed a few people before — there was a high chance it was connected to Xu Tianze. If you don’t cut the grass to the root, troubles will follow; sure enough, there were aftereffects.

Yu Feng urged hastily, "There’s no time to explain. See if you have anything to pack; if you do, hurry and gather it. I’ll take you away now and explain on the road."

"What’s the matter? I still wanted to wash up first," Yang Flame said, filthy from staying in the burrow so long; she hadn’t yet grasped the situation.

"Miss Yang, bear with it. Wash once we reach a safe place. What are you two standing there for? If there’s nothing to pack, we leave now." Seeing their slack expressions, Yu Feng grew anxious.

Yang Kai gave a wry laugh. "Brother Yu, calm down a moment — what exactly happened?"

Yu Feng stamped his foot in frustration, wishing he could knock Yang Kai senseless to stop his chatter. "I told you there’s no time to explain. I searched everywhere for you. The young lady delayed them at the clan; if we don’t leave now it’ll truly be too late."

"Hm." Yang Kai’s expression changed. He glanced to one side. A great number of people were rushing over; the pale cyan glows of Star Shuttles streaked across the sky like falling meteors.

Yu Feng’s face darkened and he sighed, knowing the young lady’s efforts had been in vain. Before those people drew near he warned, "Brother Yang, did you beat up a Young Master of the Xu Family recently?"

"Yes." Yang Kai thought to himself that he hadn’t only beaten their Young Master — he’d killed a few people — and wondered why Yu Feng hadn’t mentioned it.

Yu Feng gave a bitter smile and pointed toward the approaching group. "The Xu Family is coming for you."

"How do the Xu compare to your Haike Family?" Yang Kai asked.

"They’re about on par," Yu Feng replied. "Both are peripheral families of Yingyue Hall and don’t count for much on the big stage, but Haike and Xu have a lot of trade between them and a decent relationship. And Yang Kai, you’re not of the Haike Family — the elders won’t shield you, and the young lady can’t protect you. You were far too reckless."

Although reproving him, Yu Feng had no intention of immediately renouncing Yang Kai. As the Xu group neared he, intentionally or not, stepped in front of Yang Kai and Yang Flame.

This moved Yang Kai’s favor toward him. He stepped forward, patted Yu Feng’s shoulder, and reassured him, "Brother Yu, don’t worry. If they only want to talk, fine — but if they want to cause trouble for me, I won’t mind making sure they never return."

Yu Feng turned, surprised, and could only shake his head with a helpless sigh. "Young people… ah!"

He thought Yang Kai was speaking boldly. Although the Xu Family, like the Haike Family, was a peripheral force of Yingyue Hall, they were still a family. Even without Origin Returning Realm experts, they had a few Saint King Realm practitioners. How could a Third Stage of the Saint Realm fighter like Yang Kai stand against such power?

Moreover, the clan had no intention of protecting Yang Kai. Rather than shelter him, the elders, because of their trade ties with the Xu Family, pressured the young lady to reveal Yang Kai’s whereabouts — they were eager to hand him over so as not to damage relations between the two families.

If not for the young lady’s delay, Yu Feng could never have arrived early enough. Now that things had gone awry, he felt he had let her down and was filled with remorse.

“Hmph, such arrogant words from a youngster. This old man would like to see how you plan to make us never return!” A cold snort echoed as a thin, elderly figure descended, glaring at Yang Kai with a hostile expression.

Yang Kai hadn’t spoken softly; of course the old man had heard.

As the words fell, one figure after another alighted — at least twenty in all. They were of mixed ages and genders, with varied cultivation levels, and the strongest among them reached no more than the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Beside the speaking elder stood a bald middle‑aged man who looked nervous and pale.

Yang Kai remembered him. He had been the one who escorted Xu Tianze away; had that man not fled fast, Yang Kai would have slaughtered him long ago.

Wu Yi also arrived. After landing she looked at Yang Kai with extreme vexation, clearly not expecting him still to be here. Her glare at Yu Feng made her displeasure obvious, and Yu Feng lowered his head awkwardly, avoiding her gaze.

"Good, good — the brat didn’t run!" The Third Stage Saint King elder nodded heavily, his face full of murderous intent. Coldly he asked, "Qiu Yuan, the one who injured the Young Master last time — that was him, right?"

The bald man quickly nodded. "Yes, Elder Zhishen — it was he who wounded the Young Master."

Yang Kai raised a brow, surprised as he stared at that bald middle‑aged man called Qiu Yuan.

He had not only wounded Xu Tianze but had killed three First Stage Saint King Realm warriors, yet now the man made no mention of the three deaths.

Qiu Yuan had not told the whole truth. Yang Kai realized in an instant: Qiu Yuan was a Second Stage Saint King Realm practitioner who had brought three First Stage disciples yet still failed to protect his own Young Master. He must be concealing the full facts for fear of harsher punishment.

That the matter hadn’t been exposed meant either Xu Tianze aided Qiu Yuan in hiding it, or Xu Tianze had been reduced to an idiot by then — Yang Kai’s sudden outburst of Divine Sense had the potency to do such a thing.

The latter seemed far likelier; a Young Master like Xu Tianze would have no reason to help cover it up.

"Since it’s him, this is easy! Qiu Yuan, here’s a chance for you to atone through meritorious service: go and chop off that brat’s four limbs. I’ll take him back and dunk him into a medicine vat — I want him to live a fate worse than death!" Xu Zhishen roared, his face contorted with rage as he glared at Yang Kai.

Many shivered in horror.

To have one’s limbs hacked off and be boiled in a medicinal pot meant one might not die immediately but would be tormented for months on end — a torment truly worse than death, a cruel human punishment.

Yang Kai looked steadily at Qiu Yuan without a hint of panic.

To everyone’s surprise, Qiu Yuan did not immediately lunge forward. Instead he appeared meek and submissive; though he offered a brief reply, his feet seemed to be filled with lead and he stood rooted, his face full of terror as big beads of sweat slid from his brow and fell to the ground.

Everyone noticed something was amiss — Qiu Yuan seemed to be shaking, and no one knew why.

Bitter fear filled Qiu Yuan’s heart. He understood better than anyone the terror of this underpowered youth. If someone had told him before that a Saint Realm fighter could kill three Saint King Realm men with casual ease, he would have scoffed — the gap between realms was an unbridgeable chasm. Even if someone could fight above their level, they could not possibly accomplish such a thing.

Yet Qiu Yuan had witnessed it. That youth had killed Saint King Realm opponents as if crushing ants. Had Qiu Yuan not fled quickly when the youth had been occupied by the woman, he likely would have been killed.

The final burst of Divine Sense had made Qiu Yuan fully realize Yang Kai’s strangeness. It was a force that shrouded one’s body and mind and turned the world black. Though their Young Master had survived, he had become a drooling idiot, eyes empty and spittle running — a revolting sight. Qiu Yuan himself had been severely wounded; his Divine Sense had not yet recovered, and his Second Stage Saint King Realm cultivation had even slipped.
