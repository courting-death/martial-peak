## Chapter 668 — The Grand Gift

Towering, jagged snow mountains rose up; beneath the dazzling white lay ice layers thousands of zhang thick that had never melted. Feathery snow still whirled about, reducing visibility to nothing within thirty zhang.

The temperature here was bitterly low; even cultivators would avoid setting foot in such a place unless compelled by some special reason. Viewed from the sky, the distance vanished into whiteness, an endless expanse of snow as far as the eye could see.

Halfway up one of the peaks there was an extremely well-hidden cave entrance that led straight into the mountain's belly. Inside the walls were studded with ice crystals, the ice layers crystalline and clear, and an oppressive chill pressed outward.

A force from the void suddenly spread through the cave. In the next moment a surge of red light flared, bathing the whole cavern and turning everything within it eerily strange and forbidding.

A figure materialized from the void, apparently not yet clear on his surroundings, and crashed down onto the ice with a thunderous impact.

Once he steadied his footing, a powerful Divine Sense immediately radiated outward and probed the surroundings; after a moment his face relaxed and he drew his Divine Sense back in.

"So it really is inside the snow mountain." Yang Kai used his Divine Sense to scout the nearby terrain and murmured to himself.

Before leaving the Small Xuan Realm, Li Rong had told him that Senior Coffin-Servant was very likely hiding in a desolate, bitterly cold place.

Now it seemed her words had been true.

Coffin-Servant had been dead for who knew how many years; even if he had been a Saint Realm powerhouse of the Ancient Demon Clan with a formidable body in life, over the long years a corpse would rot and decay. The only viable way to preserve a corpse was to find some utterly uninhabited, extremely cold place to hide it away.

The interior of this snow mountain clearly met those conditions.

Li Rong had said Coffin-Servant would go out once every ten years to seek a cultivator who possessed Divine Sense Fire, or, when his body could no longer endure, he would return to his hiding place to recuperate.

A decade later he would set out again.

Coffin-Servant had carried out this routine for countless years and had brought back more than a dozen cultivators who possessed Divine Sense Fire for Li Rong and the others.

Turning his head, Yang Kai immediately saw Coffin-Servant seated in lotus posture. A foul, nauseating stench of rot exuded from his body, and the exposed flesh was covered in festering sores and tumor-like growths.

That body would not be able to hold together much longer.

Yang Kai understood inwardly; though he could not fathom what kind of obsession bound such a powerful man to his duty even after death, such loyalty was both admirable and worthy of respect!

Behind Coffin-Servant he still carried that blood-red coffin.

The world did not know what mysteries were sealed within that coffin, but Yang Kai did: the Small Xuan Realm was sealed inside it, and it was from there that he had been transmitted out.

After reaching an agreement with Li Rong and the others, Yang Kai took only half a month to refine all their remaining medicinal materials into pills. After a short rest, the three great commanders acted together, broke open the Small Xuan Realm's void, and sent Yang Kai out.

Whether they had discovered the gift he had left for them, he did not know. Yang Kai thought this and a faint smile touched his lips as he slowly withdrew, watching Coffin-Servant with vigilance.

He had no desire to rouse this Saint Realm undead from his meditation.

Although using Demon God Transformation could dispel his hostility, if any nearby powerhouse detected the fluctuation of his aura it would only expose this place.

Fortunately, Coffin-Servant remained in slumber, showing no sign of waking.

After a long while, Yang Kai left the cave.

The bitter wind struck his face and he involuntarily broke out in gooseflesh; the True Yang Technique activated of its own accord to drive away the surrounding cold.

He watched the falling snow for a while and then abandoned any attempt to fix a direction.

Although he had been on the Tongxuan Continent for a year and a half, most of that time had been spent inside the Small Xuan Realm, so he remained unfamiliar with this world. Even if he could discern a direction, he had no idea where to go.

He streaked off, vanishing into the wind and snow like lightning.

..........

At Mo Shen Fort, the three great commanders stood dumbly and watched the rift in the sky slowly close, their silence lasting a long while.

"He's gone." Han Fei murmured.

"Mm." Li Rong nodded, "But he will come back."

Hua Mo hesitated, then asked with reluctance, "Forgive me for thinking ill, Lady Li, but why are you so certain he will keep his promise?"

Li Rong smiled faintly. "My feeling." She said. "His promise that day was sincere. I choose to believe him. Wait and see—he will return, and, as he promised, lead us out of this place."

Hua Mo frowned and said no more.

Though he also wanted to believe Yang Kai's promise, humanity's deceit was notorious; who knew if he was merely deceiving them.

"Lord! Lord!" Guan'er suddenly ran up, calling urgently.

"What is it?" Li Rong turned and tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear as she asked softly.

"Look at this." Guan'er said, holding out her palm and presenting its contents to the three commanders.

"Crystal Stone?" Li Rong exclaimed. "Where did you get it?"

Although Han Fei had brought back many Crystal Stones last time, for an entire clan it was still far too few. Those Crystal Stones were now managed in batches by the three great commanders and would only be distributed at certain times.

Guan'er had received a few last time as well, but had used them quickly—she should have none left on her.

"I found them in Yang Kai's pill-refining stone chamber. Go and see—there are so many." Excitement flushed her face as she gestured eagerly.

Li Rong and Han Fei exchanged a glance and immediately flew out.

Very soon the three great commanders arrived at the stone room Yang Kai had used to refine pills. When they saw the scene inside they were struck dumb.

In one corner of the stone chamber, Crystal Stones were heaped like a mountain, an uncountable mass.

"This..." Li Rong could barely speak; her delicate body trembled and her expression overflowed with emotion.

"This must be what he gathered beneath that volcano," Han Fei explained.

"So many?" Hua Mo nearly bit his tongue, his face twitching with emotion.

When they had returned from the volcano, Han Fei had recounted what she and Yang Kai had encountered; everyone knew Yang Kai possessed vast Crystal Stone resources, but no one had mentioned this matter or demanded any of it.

Yet unexpectedly, before leaving he had left behind such a fortune.

These Crystal Stones amounted to four times what Han Fei had brought back.

"He left us so much; he himself probably doesn't have much left." Gratitude softened Han Fei's pretty face, and her gaze paused on a dozen particularly conspicuous stones—Saint Crystals—"He even left Saint Crystals..."

Recalling how she had scrambled for Crystal Stones with Yang Kai beneath the volcano and even tricked him into removing his shirt so she could carry more, Han Fei suddenly felt childish.

"Lady Li..." Hua Mo drew a deep breath, calming his excitement, and said in a deep voice, "This old one now believes he will return."

"Yes, he will return." Li Rong smiled happily, tears of relief glinting at the corners of her eyes.

If Yang Kai had never planned to return, he would never have left such an enormous fortune.

But because he had left it, it meant he hoped these Crystal Stones would bolster the Ancient Demon Clan's strength, so that when they departed this place they could defend themselves.

We must not disappoint his expectation! Li Rong thought. Now within Mo Shen Fort there were pills and Crystal Stones aplenty; in a few years' time their development need not worry them.

When he comes back next time, the Ancient Demon Clan will present him with a grand gift! Li Rong inhaled deeply, resolve hardening within her.

..........

In the snow mountains Yang Kai traveled alone. The wind and snow were so fierce he could not sustain flight for long—doing so would drain too much physical strength and spirit.

Along the way he saw no sign of other people, nor any trace of Demonic Beasts moving about.

The entire world seemed to contain only him as a spark of life.

The Spiritual Qi here was unusually rich, yet no one cultivated in this place. Even cultivators versed in cold-aspected techniques and Martial Skill would find it difficult to endure such conditions.

Yang Kai felt neither sorrow nor joy as he trekked through the endless snow peaks. From time to time a wave of unbearable pain pulsed through his shoulder blades—that was the wind-and-thunder force trapped within the Wind-and-Thunder Wings acting up.

He had absorbed the Wind-and-Thunder Wings into his body some time ago and his progress in refining them had been sloppy; Yang Kai still felt the wings would not be so easily broken down and used, and that special methods would be required.

After threading through the snow mountains for over ten days, the blizzard gradually eased.

On the summit of a high peak Yang Kai stood and looked down below. The long-missed sunlight bathed him and brought a pleasant ease to his body and spirit.

"Huh?"

He suddenly perceived several fairly strong life auras dozens of li away.

Yang Kai could not help but feel a flicker of joy. He had no clear sense of where he was and had planned to seek people to ask for direction, but after so many days had found none—now at last there were others.

Judging by the strength of those auras, there ought to be no Transcendent Realm powerhouses among them, which made Yang Kai much more at ease.

Smiling faintly, Yang Kai flew down at a leisurely pace toward them.

Dozens of li away, in the boundless white, a party of three was traveling: one man and two women, each cultivating at the seventh or eighth level of the Divine Roaming Realm. The man was handsome, the women beautiful, and they all wore golden garments; the glaring gold stood out starkly against the snow, suggesting they belonged to the same sect or clan.

At that moment the two women walked ahead, arm in arm. Even in such bitter cold one of them wore thin clothing that revealed her proud figure—tall, with ample breasts and a pert, rounded rear—that caused the man trailing behind to continually stare at her sinuous waist and the sway of her hips.

The other woman was a little shorter; her pretty face showed an innocent, inexperienced charm as she now and then cupped her hands to warm the breath at her lips, appearing coy and endearing.
