## Chapter 27 — A Sparring Match Won’t Cause Pregnancy

Before long, a group of groggy Lingxiao Pavilion disciples gathered inside Su Mu’s room.

“Young Master Su, what’s the matter?” one rubbed his eyes and asked.

“Nothing much, just something from this morning,” Su Mu said, struggling to steady his emotions. “I called everyone here because I want you all to help me come up with some ideas on how to exact revenge and ease the hatred in my heart.”

Another spoke up, “Young Master Su, why not just wait four more days? After that, I’ll challenge Yang Kai and guarantee to beat him into a bloody mess.”

Su Mu frowned, displeased. “If I could wait until then, why would I have called you all here now?”

The group had been sound asleep and were now roused abruptly, clearly lacking energy. No one responded to Su Mu’s words; instead, yawns echoed throughout the room. Seeing their reaction only fueled Su Mu’s anger further. He slammed the table and shouted, “Think carefully! If no good ideas come up today, none of you are going back to sleep!”

The disciples were startled. Only then did they realize Su Mu was truly angry. Their drowsiness vanished as they hurriedly racked their brains to devise plans.

Soon, a Lingxiao Pavilion disciple named Li Yuntian’s eyes brightened with an idea. He stepped forward and said to Su Mu, “Young Master Su, we could do this…”

As he spoke, he leaned in to whisper the details, explaining how this plan could work and what it would accomplish.

Su Mu’s face lit up with delight, repeatedly patting Li Yuntian’s shoulder. “Excellent, excellent! This is a great idea. I’ll leave this matter in your hands!”

“Rest assured, Young Master Su!” Li Yuntian beamed.

“Alright, everyone, go back to sleep,” Su Mu waved his hand. The tension eased, and the disciples quickly dispersed.

Gazing out into the pitch-black night, Su Mu smiled darkly. “Yang Kai, Senior Brother Yang, we’ll settle this at dawn!”

Moments later, Su Mu fell asleep, satisfied.

The next day, Yang Kai rose and practiced the Body Tempering Chapter once before heading out to sweep the grounds.

After a full day of cultivation using the incense burner yesterday, though his body ached terribly with soreness in his back and waist, the results were remarkable. The most noticeable effect was that when practicing the Body Tempering fists and kicks, he clearly felt the overwhelming power of heaven and earth lessen somewhat. This made sense—the exotic fragrance within the incense burner had exerted immense pressure on him, and cultivating the Body Tempering Chapter also carried great strain. Once he adapted to one, naturally, he could handle the other.

The incense burner was indeed a marvelous tool! Yang Kai felt invigorated and eager to finish his chores so he could continue cultivating.

However, halfway through sweeping, someone suddenly blocked his path. Yang Kai looked up and found the figure somewhat familiar. The man was smiling amiably at him.

Li Yuntian, who had given Su Mu the idea last night and received today’s assignment, already had a plan in mind but dared not be careless. He was confident of victory against Yang Kai but needed to lure him into a fight.

Fortunately, when causing trouble with Su Mu yesterday, Li Yuntian had stayed behind the crowd and spoken little, so Yang Kai likely hadn’t noticed him. This made things easier.

Waiting early along Yang Kai’s sweeping route, Li Yuntian soon saw him approaching. He put on a friendly smile and walked over, wearing an expression as harmless as a lamb.

“My face should look kind enough now,” Li Yuntian encouraged himself.

“Is there something you need, Junior Brother?” Yang Kai asked without ceremony. After all, all disciples at the Body Tempering Realm were his juniors. Though his realm was low, his early entry granted him seniority, so he addressed them as junior brothers.

“Are you Yang Kai, Senior Brother Yang?” Li Yuntian asked, feigning ignorance.

Yang Kai nodded. “Yes.”

Li Yuntian’s face lit up. “So it is you! Senior Brother Yang, I’ve long heard your name. Meeting you today, you truly live up to your reputation!”

Even Li Yuntian felt disgusted by his own flattery, but he had to appear sincere and friendly.

“That’s an exaggeration,” Yang Kai said modestly. Among ordinary disciples, his name was indeed quite well-known.

Li Yuntian acted overly familiar, grabbing Yang Kai’s hand and shaking it vigorously. “Senior Brother Yang, I heard you gave Zhao Hu a harsh lesson yesterday. Truly satisfying to hear!”

“Do you have a grudge against him?” Yang Kai scrutinized him.

Li Yuntian’s expression darkened. “Yes, I do. That man is a beast in human form, despicable and shameless. He once humiliated me.”

“Then why don’t you seek revenge?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

“I dream of revenge every night, but…” Li Yuntian sighed. “Senior Brother Yang, you probably know Zhao Hu has powerful backing. I don’t care about Zhao Hu himself, but his supporters are beyond my reach.”

“True enough,” Yang Kai nodded. Su Mu did have influential patrons, so ordinary disciples dared not provoke him.

“So, Senior Brother Yang, you teaching Zhao Hu a lesson yesterday was like avenging me,” Li Yuntian said gratefully.

Yang Kai smiled. “It was just a friendly sparring match, nothing serious.”

Li Yuntian continued, “If Senior Brother Yang can defeat Zhao Hu, your strength must be considerable.”

Yang Kai waved his hand. “Trifling skills, nothing worth mentioning.”

Li Yuntian sneered inwardly. That was the truth—if not for Yang Kai’s strategy, Zhao Hu wouldn’t have lost yesterday. But he dared not show it, lest Yang Kai grow suspicious.

“Senior Brother is too modest. Come, come, I, Li Yuntian, love sparring with others. Since Senior Brother has done me a favor, now that we’ve met, I can’t miss the chance,” Li Yuntian circled around until he found an opening to express his intent.

Yang Kai smiled wryly. “You want to spar with me?”

Li Yuntian nodded vigorously. “Naturally. I hope Senior Brother will kindly teach me, so I can see how you taught Zhao Hu a lesson yesterday and ease a grievance of mine.”

The excuse was somewhat far-fetched. Yang Kai shook his head. “Forget it. I don’t usually fight with others.”

Li Yuntian grew anxious. “That won’t do. Whether you agree or not, you have to agree today.”

Yang Kai looked at him with amusement.

Li Yuntian’s heart skipped a beat. His eagerness had made his tone too forceful. He quickly forced a smile. “Junior Brother is simply obsessed with martial arts. A day without sparring leaves him restless. I hope Senior Brother will indulge me.”

“That’s not appropriate,” Yang Kai refused.

“Why not?”

“This is without reason…”

Seeing Yang Kai seemed inclined, Li Yuntian pressed his advantage. “Sparring among fellow disciples is to test each other’s skills. No reason is needed. A friendly match benefits both you and me.”

“Though you say that… still no, no, no,” Yang Kai waved his hands repeatedly.

“Come on, Senior Brother, a sparring match won’t cause pregnancy,” Li Yuntian said anxiously but kept his tone polite. Then, as if struck by a thought, he added, “Are you afraid of losing and having Contribution Points deducted?”
