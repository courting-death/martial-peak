## Chapter 1790 — Divine Bird Leaves the Nest

"What's happening?" Yang Kai cried out, standing in place, his gaze trembling as he stared at the scene on the horizon.

Over there was the spot from which the sound came every time the Seven Luminaries Peacock breathed—the very place the Divine Bird nested!

Yang Kai had long been curious just how strong the Seven Luminaries Peacock truly was, but he had never been able to get a handle on it.

However, judging from the power of the Seven Luminaries Divine Light it exhaled, the Divine Bird was by no means inferior to a Third Stage of the Void King Realm! It might even be more terrifying than a Third Stage.

He had even considered going to see what the Divine Bird looked like, but had never worked up the nerve. Yet now, from the situation over there, the Seven Luminaries Peacock seemed to be acting strangely.

Had some blind fool gone and provoked it?

Yang Kai thought this and inwardly felt pity for whoever had angered it; to have provoked the Seven Luminaries Peacock would likely mean death without a grave.

"Wait, that's not right!" he exclaimed, because only then did he notice that although the commotion over there was obvious, there were absolutely no battle ripples—clearly no one had stirred up the Seven Luminaries Peacock. When that seven-colored radiance spread across the sky, a huge silhouette rose from the ground and merged into the light; then the seven-colored radiance slowly contracted and sped off into the distance, growing smaller and smaller.

"It flew away?" Yang Kai frowned and could only make that guess.

The next moment, his face was alight with wild joy!

The Seven Luminaries Peacock had always nested in some spot deep within Medicine Valley; wherever that place was, there must be something that attracted it to stay—meaning there was bound to be a treasure there!

Now that the Seven Luminaries Peacock had flown off, wasn't this the perfect chance to go and take a look?

Once that thought arose, Yang Kai could not suppress it; intent on investigating, he stood there struggling over the decision for a while, then gritted his teeth and sped off in that direction.

At the same time, in a certain place within Medicine Valley, Zi Long stood with his eyes flashing fanatical light as he stared at the seven-colored radiance disappearing at the horizon, and he shouted, "The time has come—didn't expect to be this lucky; after only being in here a little over ten days I encounter the Divine Bird leaving its nest. Hahaha, truly a heaven-sent opportunity!"

Zi Long had always appeared calm, but now his expression was excited, as if he had stumbled upon something that only appeared once in ten thousand years.

Xu Wei stood beside him looking utterly bewildered.

Zi Donglai immediately asked with delight, "So does that mean we can obtain the Everlasting Tree?"

"The Everlasting Tree?" Xu Wei's eyes went wide. Staring at Zi Donglai, he blurted, "Young Master, did you just say the Everlasting Tree?"

He obviously knew of the Everlasting Tree's existence and what it signified, but he'd only heard of it in rumor and had thought such a thing might not actually exist.

Yet just now he had actually heard Zi Donglai say the words 'Everlasting Tree.'

Putting the clues together, Xu Wei immediately deduced that the Divine Bird's nesting place must house the Everlasting Tree—a supreme heaven-and-earth treasure!

"What's it to you?" Zi Donglai coldly sneered at Xu Wei; earlier his excitement had exposed some key information, but it didn't matter too much—after all, the three of them would be going over there. Even if he didn't say anything now, Xu Wei would see the Everlasting Tree for himself soon enough.

Xu Wei looked embarrassed and dared not ask further.

"Whether we can obtain it I don't know yet, but this is undoubtedly an excellent opportunity!" Zi Long took a deep breath. "Let's go—if I'm right, others will be heading that way too."

Zi Donglai snorted, "They're courting death!"

The Everlasting Tree—this Heaven-Defying supreme treasure—belonged by right to Purple Star; only he and his father were qualified to refine it, and once obtained they would share it. Father and son would achieve undying bodies; given time, they could cultivate to the peak of the Martial Dao and dominate the Star Domain—what a glorious prospect!

Anyone who dared to compete for the Everlasting Tree with them deserved to die!

Elsewhere, Ni Guang, with Xue Yue at his side, was also hurrying toward the Divine Bird's nesting place.

"Uncle Ni, how long before the Seven Luminaries Peacock returns?" Xue Yue asked as she followed Ni Guang.

"I'm not sure," Ni Guang replied. "The Divine Bird leaves its nest at intervals; sometimes for a short time, sometimes for a long time—it depends on its mood. But this is a rare chance; even if we can't get the Everlasting Tree, we must take the Immortal Source Liquid! Though not as precious as the Everlasting Tree, it is one of the Three Divine Waters—one drop can restore flesh to bone and bring the dead back to life; it's a true lifesaving elixir!"

"Zi Long and his group will go too, right?" Xue Yue frowned.

"They won't miss this chance. We've prepared to secure the Immortal Source Liquid; Zi Long surely won't be unprepared either, but once we're there how the treasure is taken will depend on each person's skill. Be careful— I might not have much energy to watch over you."

"I know. Don't worry, Uncle Ni." Xue Yue nodded, staring ahead—she didn't know whether that fellow would be drawn by the commotion and come; if they could meet up, it would improve their odds.

Two thousand li to the left of Ni Guang and Xue Yue, Ghost Ancestor, shrouded in black mist, gazed in the direction of the disturbance. After a long silence, he spoke somewhat listlessly, “Hmm… might as well take a look. That boy Yang probably wouldn’t pass up such a lively scene. Best to head over there and meet up with him—there’s less and less worth collecting in this damned place anyway.”

Three Void King experts at the Second Stage were all drawn by the commotion and advanced toward the same destination, and other Void Kings at the First Stage likewise could not help but be attracted.

Although most people didn't know about the Everlasting Tree or the Immortal Source Liquid, their thoughts were the same as Yang Kai's: the Divine Bird's nesting place must hold a great treasure, and none would miss such a rare opportunity.

In an instant, everyone in Medicine Valley was drawn there, each employing their own methods to surge forward.

At the very center of Medicine Valley was a vast flat ground, open and bare—no trees, no weeds—only a sapling one chi high, its whole body verdant, swaying in the wind.

This small sapling looked fragile and delicate, yet within its leaves and roots was contained an unimaginable vitality—so rich and dense that it was visible to the naked eye, forming a faint halo around it.

The sapling bore only seven leaves, and on several of those leaves were droplets like dewdrops—round, flawless, milky white, emitting an intoxicating fragrance.

There were only three droplets in total.

This was the fabled Immortal Source Liquid, the wondrous treasure that grew on the leaves of the Everlasting Tree! It was an impossible-to-find object; rumor held that the Immortal Source Liquid could revive the dead—if someone had not been dead for too long and their body was not too badly damaged, a single drop could bring them back to life.

Among the Three Divine Waters, the Immortal Source Liquid was the most valuable because it was a lifesaving treasure.

Suddenly a figure flew in from afar and quickly arrived beside the flat ground. From the speed and the Saint Yuan fluctuations emanating from him, he was clearly a First Stage of the Void King Realm expert.

Meng Tong!

That Void King expert with no background, who had always cultivated alone!

"No one else!" Meng Tong glanced about and, finding himself the first to arrive, rejoiced—his small eyes spun about and he spotted the Everlasting Tree not far off.

"What is this?" Meng Tong stared at the Everlasting Tree in astonishment; for a moment he couldn't recognize it.

Although he couldn't identify the Everlasting Tree, he could tell the sapling was extraordinary, and that the milky droplets on its leaves were treasures.

"Damn it, why is the Seven Luminaries Divine Light still here?" Meng Tong shouted, almost so frustrated he felt sick.

The Divine Bird had indeed left, and he had been the first to arrive, but within a radius of ten zhang around the Everlasting Tree the Seven Luminaries Divine Light still lingered, wrapping the Everlasting Tree tightly.

Anyone who wanted to take the treasure had to break through the sealing of the Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

Meng Tong did not dare risk his life; he scratched his head in frustration, with no good idea.

Whoosh——

The sound of a strong wind came from not far away. Meng Tong's expression changed as he sensed others approaching. He turned and saw three lights streaking together; in no time they arrived beside him, the lights dissipated, revealing Zi Long and his son and Xu Wei.

Meng Tong frowned and subtly put some distance between himself and Zi Long's group. His gaze fell on Xu Wei's missing arm and his eyes involuntarily narrowed, heart heavy with sympathy.

He did not know what Xu Wei had suffered to lose an arm, nor why Xu Wei was allied with Zi Long and his son, but he knew himself to be alone and utterly no match for these people.

The heaven-sent opportunity had slipped past him, and Meng Tong sighed heavily, filled with loathing for the presence of the Divine Light.

If not for the Divine Light's protection, he would have snatched the Everlasting Tree already instead of standing here dazed.

"Good opportunity!" Zi Long said as he landed, his eyes flashing with killing intent.

He had not expected to have arrived so quickly; there was only Meng Tong here, and from Meng Tong's appearance it was clear he had no idea what to do.

Since Meng Tong had gotten here first, Zi Long would not waste time—he moved to approach the Everlasting Tree.

"Brother Zi, you're quick!" A voice that made Zi Long uneasy sounded, and he halted. Looking toward the source, he soon saw Ni Guang arrive with Xue Yue, landing not far away.

"Brother Ni, you're fast too!" Zi Long snorted, deeply displeased—if Ni Guang had been only a bit slower, he might have been the first to seize the treasure.
