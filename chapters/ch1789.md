## Chapter 1789 — Anomaly

"Huh..." Zi Donglai suddenly exclaimed in surprise, and produced from Xu Wei's ring a token-like object.

The token's material was strange, neither metal nor wood; even Zi Donglai's trained eyes could not identify it. The token was pitch-black, and on its face was carved a large character meaning "Emperor."

The characters flowed with an incredibly profound meaning. At a single glance, Zi Donglai felt his very soul struck by that mysterious essence, and his expression changed in shock.

"Star Emperor Token!" Zi Long blurted the words the moment he saw the token, snatching it from Zi Donglai's hand; hot light flared in his eyes as he released his Divine Sense to probe it.

It was unmistakably a Star Emperor Token!

The Star Emperor Token had been personally forged by the Great Emperor in ages past; within the Star Domain it was the stuff of legend, rarely seen. Zi Long, as the lord of the Purple Star, was one of the little handful of experts perched atop the Star Domain, so he was naturally not ignorant of the token's secrets.

Moreover, Purple Star itself also possessed a Star Emperor Token, kept by a Grand Elder at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; that Grand Elder used the Imperial Might contained within the token to seclude himself for years, contemplating the Martial Dao in hopes of a breakthrough.

"An already unsealed Star Emperor Token..." Zi Long said after a moment's probing, his face betraying a faint disappointment when he discovered the imperial ability originally sealed within had already been used.

"This thing was obtained by this old servant during earlier adventures..." Xu Wei forced a smile as he explained, inwardly bitter to the core—if this Star Emperor Token had not already been unsealed, he would never have fallen to his present state.

Rumor held that the Great Emperor had forged nine Star Emperor Tokens in total, each one sealing a single divine technique of his, their might unfathomable.

How powerful the Great Emperor truly was, no one could gauge, but using one of the Great Emperor's techniques to annihilate Zi Long and his son would be perfectly feasible.

If the technique sealed within this Star Emperor Token still existed, Xu Wei would have used it long ago; he would not have handed over his soul imprint and been forced into subjugation.

"Father, I've heard people say the Star Emperor Token hides a world-shattering mystery— is that true?" Zi Donglai asked curiously, staring at the token in Zi Long's hand; as the Young Master of Purple Star he had indeed never before seen a genuine Star Emperor Token, only read about them in various records.

"Whether there is some earth-shattering secret I cannot say for certain. But there is indeed such a rumor," Zi Long replied calmly. "Even if such a secret exists, one or two Star Emperor Tokens would not reveal it. Perhaps only by gathering all nine could one glimpse its truth."

"Gather all nine?" Zi Donglai was stunned for a moment, then laughed. "I fear no one in the world could manage such a thing now. The Star Emperor Tokens have existed for so many years and have long been lost across the Star Domain; I only heard that the Hengluo Commerce Guild has one..."

"Not just the Hengluo Commerce Guild— the Sword Alliance has one as well!"

"The Sword Alliance actually has one too?" Zi Donglai voiced his surprise.

“Don’t underestimate the Sword Alliance. Though among the three great forces of the Star Domain it is relatively the weakest, it is still not to be taken lightly. In the era when the Great Emperor still lived, all three of our forces had dealings with him and lent him some small assistance. As thanks, the Great Emperor bestowed upon each of our factions a Star Emperor Token, each one sealed with a trace of his divine ability. That is how the Star Emperor Tokens of our Purple Star, the Hengluo Commerce Guild, and the Sword Alliance came to be.”

"There was such a thing?" Zi Donglai was continually shocked, and even Xu Wei listened beside them with his mouth agape.

Although he was an elder of the Abandoned Nest, he was entirely ignorant of such secret matters.

"It has been too long," Zi Long sighed. "Over tens of thousands of years, the Star Emperor Tokens held by our three powers have already been used in their respective calamities. Were it not for those tokens, perhaps our three forces would not have survived. The rise and fall of powers is like the tide; there is no everlasting dynasty, no undefeated power. Only individual strength is truly eternal. Remember that."

“Yes, this child understands!” Zi Donglai nodded respectfully, though in his heart he swore to himself: once he returned, he would enter seclusion and never emerge until he broke through to the Void King Realm. And if one day he could reach the Great Emperor’s level, he would become the new legend of the Star Domain—surpassing the Great Emperor himself. What greater glory could there be?

By the time he finished speaking, Zi Long had already stored the Star Emperor Token in his Spatial Ring.

Although this Star Emperor Token had been unsealed, its value remained immense.

Zi Donglai then returned the Spatial Ring to Xu Wei, but the good things inside had already been swept away. Xu Wei released a sliver of Divine Sense to probe it and winced as if several jin of flesh had been cut from him, cursing under his breath.

"Let's go. Be careful of those spatial rifts— that brat might really be hiding among them, waiting for a chance to strike!" Zi Long scanned the surrounding spatial fissures and took the lead.

Zi Donglai quickly fell in beside him, while Xu Wei covered the rear, his face pale and helpless.

Within the void rift, Yang Kai drifted about at will.

After ambushing Xu Wei, he had returned to the safe confines of the void rift and, in high spirits, begun hunting for Ethereal Crystals.

The words he left before were merely to intimidate his foes— he would never be so bored as to tail Zi Long and the others constantly. One raid was enough; a second attempt would assuredly be guarded against, and besides, it would be a waste of time.

There were so many good things here; Yang Kai had no intention of squandering time on those few people.

So after leaving that remark, he departed with a casual air.

He had considered his targets carefully— Zi Long was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm and Yang Kai could not be sure of a successful sneak attack, so he focused on Xu Wei. Though he had failed to kill him, having the Seven Luminaries Divine Light sweep Xu Wei's arm had at least brought back some small gain.

If things went as he guessed, Xu Wei would have to sever his own arm to survive; such a grievous injury would severely deplete his Yuan Qi, and perhaps Zi Long would not spare him, leaving him to bleed out on the spot.

What Yang Kai did not anticipate was that Zi Long did not kill Xu Wei, but instead had his son accept Xu Wei's soul imprint...

The Seven Luminaries Divine Light had only just receded and time was ample, so after drifting about the void rift for half an incense Yang Kai found a thinner point in the void and slipped back into Medicine Valley.

The place was quiet, with no sign of anyone; Yang Kai cheerfully began seeking heaven-and-earth treasures.

Half an hour later he returned to the void rift.

Cycle after cycle, Yang Kai's gains grew ever larger.

At the same time he quietly kept track of the time.

Before coming in, Ni Guang had mentioned to him that in this Lost Realm a person could remain at most one month, after which they needed to return through the entrance to the Star Domain, otherwise the consequences would be grave.

The residual ancient aura here was too intense for modern cultivators to remain long; if one stayed too long the realm's laws would suppress and expel them.

Just as Qian Tong had been rejected by the Dark Star's laws, various heavenly tidal forces would be levied upon a cultivator— forces no mortal strength could withstand.

But it was still early; Yang Kai estimated he had been in the Lost Realm no more than eleven or twelve days. Even accounting for time to return, he believed he still had at least ten days left.

Thus he felt free to roam about Medicine Valley.

In the blink of an eye, several more days passed.

As time wore on, the number of heaven-and-earth treasures to be found in Medicine Valley dwindled; it was only natural— though the valley was large it had its limits, and even the small number of cultivators who had entered had already taken what could be found after such prolonged searching.

Even the yield of Ethereal Crystals began to shrink drastically.

That day Yang Kai spent half a day and gathered only three Ethereal Crystals and a single herb of mediocre quality.

Compared with his first day in the valley, this haul was utterly meager.

"Time to rendezvous with Ghost Ancestor!" Yang Kai said to himself as he preserved the herb in his Spatial Ring.

With the harvest dwindling, splitting up from the Ghost Ancestor no longer made much sense; reuniting would allow them to watch each other's backs.

With that in mind, Yang Kai began to pour Saint Yuan into the mark Ghost Ancestor had left on his shoulder.

He waited for a long while, but Ghost Ancestor did not appear.

It seemed Ghost Ancestor was not within a thousand li, so he could not sense Yang Kai's call.

Yang Kai did not fret and planned to try elsewhere when suddenly a tremendous sound echoed from the depths of Medicine Valley.

At first Yang Kai instinctively thought the Seven Luminaries Divine Light was coming, but in the next instant he realized something was amiss.

The arrival and departure of the Seven Luminaries Divine Light followed a fixed rhythm he could measure precisely, and by his reckoning there should have been at least another cup of tea's worth of time before its next appearance.

Moreover, the sound itself was wrong.

Because the Seven Luminaries Divine Light was exhaled and inhaled by the divine beast, the Seven Luminaries Peacock, every time the light surged forth, the sound of its breathing could be faintly heard from the depths of the Medicine Valley.

But the sound now reaching his ears was not breathing at all; it sounded like the wind stirred by the beating of wings, a mournful whistling.

At that thought Yang Kai's expression altered sharply as he looked up toward the source of the noise.

In that instant a strange cry rang out.

The call resembled a cat's mew but was far louder and crystal-clear, piercing the clouds like a sword as if it would cleave through the Lost Realm itself.

Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness trembled, churning with a sudden storm.

Immediately the horizon bloomed with seven-colored light, spreading across half the sky!
