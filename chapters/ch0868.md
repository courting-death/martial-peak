## Chapter 868 — Not a Single Soul Left

If they were really settled inside the Tianxiao Sect, never mind what outsiders would think, the sect’s disciples might well come into conflict with the Ancient Demon Clan.

And it would damage the reputation of the Tianxiao Sect.

Outsiders might even assume the Tianxiao Sect was colluding with demons.

Hearing Chu Lingxiao ask, Yang Kai didn’t hide anything and said gravely, “I already have a place in mind to settle them.”

“Oh? Tell us.”

“I want to take them to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. It sits at the very edge of human territory and borders the Yao Realm; if we put them there, there shouldn’t be any problems.”

“The Nine Heavens Sacred Land?” Cang Yan frowned. “You’re familiar with that place? Why would they agree to let you bring demons there?”

“Besides, I heard something major happened over at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and it’s now occupied by a Great Yao Lord,” Fei Yu said with worry. “If you go there now, even if you once knew people there you probably won’t be able to find them. That Great Yao Lord has top-tier cultivation at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—he’s not someone to bargain with.”

Yang Kai scratched his head, watching their reactions, and lowered his voice: “To be frank with you, senior aunt and uncles, I am the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land…”

The four seniors were struck dumb, staring at Yang Kai in stunned silence.

Even Chu Lingxiao was momentarily taken aback.

After a long pause, Cang Yan looked at Yang Kai hesitantly. “Are you joking, little nephew… or are you serious?”

“Do I look like I’m joking?” Yang Kai shrugged.

“A new Saint Lord?” Li Wan’s mouth twitched as if he still hadn’t processed it.

Fei Jian thought for a moment and nodded. “Hm, I did hear the Nine Heavens Sacred Land has a new Saint Lord—and he’s young…” He looked Yang Kai up and down, searching for signs.

“You little rascal!” Fei Yu ground her teeth and hissed, “If you’ve been hiding anything else from us, spit it out!”

“There’s nothing else.” Yang Kai shrank his neck. “I’d planned to find a chance to tell you, but there never was a good moment. So… heh heh.”

“That Great Yao Lord… can you handle him?” Chu Lingxiao asked solemnly, a trace of worry showing.

“Rest assured, Ancestor, I made an agreement with that Great Yao Lord. The Nine Heavens Sacred Land is only being kept under their watch for a time; when I go there this time I’ll take it back.”

“Hm. You do have that kind of power now.” Chu Lingxiao glanced toward Li Rong and the others standing nearby, who were watching closely, and smiled slightly. “Although I don’t like demons, from their manner they truly care for you. The one who fought that demoness earlier—was that the woman?”

“Yes. Xueli slew the Coffin-Bearer; their hatred can no longer be resolved.”

“That’s for the best. As for these demon folk… you decide what to do. If it weren’t you standing before me, I absolutely wouldn’t let them walk away.”

“Thank you, Ancestor.” Yang Kai looked grateful.

Yang Kai felt Chu Lingxiao and the senior uncles and aunt’s indulgence and protection keenly.

As Chu Lingxiao said—if it hadn’t been him standing there, he would not have let the matter drop.

“Ancestor, what about those from Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall?” Cang Yan’s brows knitted and a cold light flashed in his eyes. “If we let them go, word of what happened here will spread quickly!”

Chu Lingxiao’s brow creased; after a moment he said leisurely, “Today I brought you four here and only intercepted Xueli for an instant. As for the others… I didn’t see anything.”

Hearing this, the four seniors of the Tianxiao Sect were stunned; when they recovered they all glanced at Yang Kai with knowing looks and low, meaningful laughter.

Cang Yan patted Yang Kai’s shoulder. “Little nephew, take care of yourself. If anything goes wrong, return to the sect—Tianxiao Sect will always be your home.”

“I’ll keep your seat on Qixiu Peak warm for you—remember to come back and visit.” Fei Yu said cheerfully.

“Who knows, maybe we’ll pay a visit to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land as well, to see for ourselves the might of you, the Saint Lord! I hear there are quite a few Saintesses over there… each one elegant and extraordinary, far from ordinary.” Li Wan wore a lewd grin across his face.

Fei Jian said nothing, merely nodded slightly at Yang Kai.

“Senior aunt and uncles…” Yang Kai’s lips moved; he didn’t know what to say, only feeling a warm glow in his chest.

“Let’s go, see if we can still catch that demoness’ trail. After taking a hit from the Locking Demon Chain, she’s probably badly wounded.” Chu Lingxiao’s gaze suddenly deepened; True Yuan wrapped the four of them, and their forms flickered into streaks of light that vanished in an instant as they sped off toward the void.

“Chu—Brother Chu…” Zhang Ao cried, alarmed, shouting hoarsely.

No one expected Chu Lingxiao to simply leave like that; he clearly had no intention of rescuing them.

“Brother Zhang, looks like we’ve been abandoned—Chu Lingxiao and that brat are clearly in league!” Cao Guan’s face went ice-cold.

Realizing this, unease rippled through everyone.

Around them, over a thousand Ancient Demon Clan warriors glared like wolves. The faces and bodies of five Saint Realm experts were covered in feral demon marks, their auras erratic.

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan and the others involuntarily stepped back, gathering their strength, swallowing hard as they looked at Li Rong and the others with dread.

“My lord, what should we do with these people?” Li Rong asked softly.

Yang Kai grinned, making no sound.

Sensing the killing intent, Zhang Ao cried out: “Saint Lord Yang, must you wipe us out? This is our fault, but leave us a way out so we can meet again! I swear I won’t reveal what I saw today!”

“Leave you a way out?” Yang Kai laughed. “There’s no need for that, is there? I don’t think we’ll ever meet again!”

His expression turned cold as he spat a single word: “Kill!”

Ever since the crisis at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land began, these people had opposed him at every turn; moments ago they’d even tried to twist the truth. People like them would inevitably become future disasters if left alive.

Yang Kai was not a magnanimous man—on the contrary, he was vengeful in certain matters.

With his temperament, how could he allow Zhang Ao and Cao Guan to live?

At Yang Kai’s command, over a thousand Ancient Demon Clan warriors cried out in joy, clutching strange, aged secret treasures and surging like madmen toward the forces of Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall.

The Ancient Demon Clan had been sealed away for too long.

They were the elite among demons—bloodthirsty, brutal, and wicked.

The violence hidden in their bones had been suppressed for thousands of years; now it finally had a chance to be unleashed.

Each of them used their full strength in an instant; like a tidal wave they swept over the forces of Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall, scattering them to pieces.

The two factions’ four Saint Realm experts were likewise targeted by Han Fei and the others.

Han Fei and Hua Mo, both at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, were eager for a bloody battle to deepen their understanding of their realms, and they struck without mercy.

Though Zhang Ao possessed Second Stage of the Saint Realm cultivation, facing an Ancient Demon who unleashed the Demon God Transformation left him powerless to retaliate; Li Rong didn’t even need to move and the four Saint Realm experts were overpowered.

Blood flew; awful screams rang through the skies as the white mountain was stained crimson, a shocking sight.

Corpses collapsed one after another; in their last moments it was as if they had seen something terrifying—their eyes bulged wide.

The Ancient Demon Clan’s savagery chilled even Wu Jie, who stood watching nearby and felt his eyelids twitch.

In battle they were utterly inhuman; even after killing their enemies they tore them apart, leaving no intact bodies—only gore.

During the slaughter the demon clansmen licked their lips unconsciously, feral and cruel as they stared at their foes, evidently reveling in the butchery.

Even the usually mischievous Guan’er became another person in battle; her delicate body radiated murderous intent, her pretty face contorted, and with the demon marks across her skin she often crushed an enemy’s will simply by drawing near.

“Leave none—chickens and dogs alike!”

Li Rong issued the command coldly; with a flick of her pale hand several blood-lights shot up like banners and tore through the crowd. The stench of blood rose as warriors from Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall were swallowed by the lights, floundering and screaming like evil spirits—before long a great many lay dead.

Her lithe form surged forward and attacked Zhang Ao.

Wu Jie’s lips went dry and his body shook as he watched the scene of carnage that resembled Shura’s Purgatory; he was terrified.

The Ancient Demon Clan fought like wolves and tigers, their twisted laughter echoing as they moved through seas of blood, slaying enemy after enemy with palpable excitement.

They seemed to love this slaughter—no mercy, no restraint, just indulgence in killing.

Wu Jie finally realized the terror of these people, a chill rising in his heart.

Compared to ordinary demons, these were the true devils.

The frenzy before him even affected his mind, making his blood boil. Gradually his eyes reddened, his trembling ceased, and from deep inside rose a craving for the baptism of blood—an urge to rush forward and fight with his own hands.

He wanted to cherish that inner thrill.

“Wu Jie!” Suddenly Yang Kai’s low command sounded in his ear.

The voice jolted Wu Jie; his body shook and his reddened eyes cleared, the bloodlust in his heart calming as if a hand had been laid upon it.

Coming to his senses, Wu Jie broke out in a cold sweat and hurried to calm his spirit, guarding the clarity of his soul for fear of being influenced again by the Ancient Demon Clan.

“Thank you, Saint Lord!” Wu Jie said in a low voice, his respect for Yang Kai growing.

This young man’s cultivation was one stage lower than his own, yet here he remained composed and untouched by the chaos—clearly his mental cultivation surpassed Wu Jie’s.

Realizing this, Wu Jie felt a shock in his heart.
