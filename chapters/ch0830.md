## Chapter 830 — Senior?

In the deepest part of the valley, Yang Kai stared at the suddenly appearing golden dragon head, his thoughts in turmoil.

The numbness along his back surged to an extreme; accompanied by a loud dragon roar, the golden dragon pattern branded on his back shot out like a living thing, flying straight for the dragon head in the sky.

For a moment, golden light flared so brightly it was almost blinding.

When everything settled, Yang Kai discovered he was standing within a world of dazzling gold, vast energies swirling around him, and a golden dragon only a few zhang long kept devouring those energies.

Yang Kai made a brief probe and immediately relaxed.

The little golden dragon carried its own aura — it should be the image that had been imprinted on his back — but for some reason it had manifested. As it swallowed the golden energies, its form subtly changed, growing larger while its aura grew richer and more far-reaching.

A heavy thud sounded from behind; Yang Kai turned and saw a youth of about fourteen or fifteen collapse to the ground, his face deathly pale as he stared at Yang Kai in terror.

Yang Kai knit his brows.

Earlier, all his attention had been drawn to the anomaly here; he hadn't even noticed when the boy had been dragged in.

The youth's cultivation was only True Yuan Realm, Seventh Stage — compared to Yang Kai, he was like an ant.

Yang Kai released his divine sense and slowly shook his head; something was off here — his divine sense was trapped inside the golden sea of energy and couldn't detect anything outside.

And looking around, there was nothing to be seen; at this place and time there was only himself and the youth.

He smiled faintly and stepped toward him.

He had plenty of guesses. This was the perfect chance to confirm them with the boy.

As Yang Kai drew near, the youth panicked utterly; before Yang Kai could get close, the boy's eyes rolled back and he fainted.

"Really?" Yang Kai was astonished — he wasn't especially handsome, but he certainly didn't look terrifying; the kid's courage was pitifully small.

With no other choice, Yang Kai sat cross‑legged and waited quietly while he scanned the area.

This place was completely swathed in a golden sea of energy; the thing manifested from the dragon pattern on his back continued to consume it, and Yang Kai tried to see if he could break through that energy's seal but found himself powerless.

That golden barrier was as solid as metal; Yang Kai estimated that even if he entered the Demonic State and forced a breakthrough, he couldn't tear an opening.

Tearing space might let him leave, but the dragon image from his back would remain here — he couldn't recall or summon it away — so he could only accept the situation.

In any case, it was unlikely anyone from outside could enter.

He examined the youth and was surprised to find the boy cultivated the same Yang attribute as he did. The True Yuan in the boy wasn't particularly dense, but for someone at his level it was respectable.

It took a good half day before the youth finally stirred awake.

When his eyes opened, he seemed momentarily puzzled; upon seeing Yang Kai sitting before him with a smile, his face changed and he scrambled back a short distance, eyes full of caution.

His gaze was full of dread.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Don't be afraid — I just have a few questions to ask."

The youth remained on guard, adopting a desperate stance as his True Yuan surged.

Yang Kai couldn't help but show a trace of approval.

In a way, the youth reminded him of his former self: when facing a powerful foe, one instinctively wanted to fight back.

"Killing you would be a mere gesture, something you couldn't stop me from doing!" Yang Kai grinned, revealing a set of white, sharp fangs.

Hearing that, the youth seemed to accept it as likely; he sighed heavily, resigned himself, patted his backside as he stood, and said casually, "Senior, ask whatever you need."

"Senior?" Yang Kai was startled — it was the first time anyone had called him that. He nodded slightly, thinking 'senior' or 'elder' would do; after all, his strength far exceeded the boy's and he was nearly ten years older, so it wasn't inappropriate.

"Which faction are you from?" Yang Kai considered for a moment and then asked.

The youth's eyes flickered; after hesitating he said, "Dragon-Phoenix Palace... Senior don't know it?"

"Dragon‑Phoenix Palace... of course!" Yang Kai drew in a light breath — when he had felt the abnormality in the dragon pattern on his back he had already guessed as much; this merely confirmed it.

When he had been with the Ice Sect, Yang Kai had heard the Ice Lord Qing Ya mention the Dragon‑Phoenix Palace.

Qing Ya had told him that the inheritance he and Su Yan obtained might be related to the Palace; long ago the Palace had been a powerful force on par with the Ice Sect, but due to an accident its line of inheritance was severed and it gradually declined.

Though diminished, its flame had never been completely extinguished.

There were several forces on the continent with similar fates; Dragon‑Phoenix Palace was not unique.

At that time Yang Kai had secretly resolved to visit the Palace when he had the chance, but after leaving the Ice Sect he was swept into a series of troubles.

Until today, when by chance he tore space and arrived here.

He didn't know whether it was fate.

Once he learned this place was Dragon‑Phoenix Palace, Yang Kai immediately confirmed that the inheritance he and Su Yan had received in the Inheritance Celestial Cave indeed came from this force.

"Senior... who are you? Why did you trigger a sealing formation in Dragon Valley that had been sealed for countless years? Before this we all thought it was only a legend."

"Me?" Yang Kai thought for a moment and replied casually, "I'm somewhat tied to your Palace."

The youth's face lit up and he hurriedly asked, "So that means we're family?"

"Family? Heh — if that's how you want to think of it, fine."

The youth visibly relaxed, "That's good, that's good — I thought I was dead this time."

"Worried I'd kill you?" Yang Kai glanced at him sideways.

The youth awkwardly scratched his head. "Senior, forgive me — I was just being foolish. Oh, by the way, so you know, I'm Sun Yu, a disciple of Dragon‑Phoenix Palace."

"My surname is Yang..." Yang Kai smiled and inclined his head.

"Greetings, Senior Yang." Sun Yu looked elated, as if he'd met a senior of his sect, and showed respectful manners.

It was no wonder he felt that way: whoever could activate Dragon Valley's seal must have some connection to the Palace, and Yang Kai's admission put Sun Yu at ease; as family there was no need to be anxious.

"Come, sit and tell me — I have many questions." Yang Kai invited in a friendly tone.

"Ask, Senior Yang, and I will answer everything I know." Sun Yu nodded eagerly.

After a long conversation with Sun Yu, Yang Kai gradually understood the situation of Dragon‑Phoenix Palace.

It was neither mighty nor weak; the Palace had at least one Saint Realm expert — the one Yang Kai had sensed at the valley's entrance, Palace Master Chen Zhou.

Though only First Stage of the Saint Realm, he could still barely ensure the Palace's safety.

The Dragon Valley trial opened once every three years. The youths here had been selected from nearby subordinate forces during that period.

Some of them were Palace disciples, like Sun Yu.

Those chosen from subordinate forces or minor families who failed the trial had to return to where they came from.

Each Palace Master had continued to hold such trials in the hope that someday a disciple would pass and restore the Palace's glory.

Unfortunately, over the years masters had changed many times without anyone succeeding, and aside from the Master, others came to believe there was no real mystery in Dragon Valley.

It wasn't until Yang Kai inadvertently arrived that they saw hope.

As Sun Yu spoke, he suddenly slapped his thigh and cried, "Oh no — the Master will surely think I opened the seal and passed the Dragon Valley trial!"

"Let them think that — what's the harm?" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"But… it wasn't me. I was just walking in the valley when a force yanked me here. No — I have to get out and tell the Master."

"You can't leave," Yang Kai shook his head and looked around. "Not just you — I can't leave either until these golden energies are completely consumed."

"No way!" Sun Yu's face drained of color. "Then what do we do?"

"Wait." Yang Kai was brief and unshaken.

Seeing his calm, Sun Yu was reassured and sat back down in front of Yang Kai.

In further conversation Yang Kai learned from Sun Yu that Dragon Valley hid the Dragon Emperor's inheritance, and that besides Dragon Valley the Palace had another forbidden place — the Phoenix Nest!

Hidden within that Phoenix Nest was the Phoenix Empress's inheritance.

Anyone who passed the Dragon Valley trial could seek out a favored woman to inherit the position of Phoenix Empress.

The Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress were the titles of the Palace's two strongest figures long ago; with them present the Palace had been among the continent's mightiest forces.

Now the Palace's helmsman only dared to call himself the Palace Master.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he grew curious about the Phoenix Nest — it should be where Su Yan had gone.

"For those of us selected, even if we don't pass Dragon Valley, the Master will grant us a set of cultivation techniques. If we find a suitable girl, we won't fall far behind in our training."

"Dual Cultivation Technique?" Yang Kai said, speaking the secret plainly.

Sun Yu's face reddened and he nodded slightly.

"Have you found a favored girl?"

Sun Yu shook his head, cheeks even redder. "There are many beautiful girls in the Palace... we can choose freely, and once we choose, we are bound for life."

Yang Kai's expression moved; only those who had practiced dual cultivation knew what 'bound for life' truly meant, and Sun Yu's words struck a chord with him, warming his gaze considerably.
