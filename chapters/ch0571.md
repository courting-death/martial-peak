## Chapter 571 — The Secret Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm

“So long?” Yang Kai frowned, then smiled and said, “Senior Li, if you’re here to inquire about those Ancestral Treasures, there’s no need to worry. As I said before, once we get through this difficult period, I will surely return everything in full.”

Yang Kai bore no ill will toward Li Yuanchun.

Perhaps at first, when those people from overseas sects just arrived, Yang Kai felt a bit annoyed. But as matters unfolded, he had already resolved to keep them here and face the crisis together.

Those overseas individuals were by no means weak—over fifty Divine Roaming Realm experts, and one beyond the Divine Roaming Realm—a powerful force to be reckoned with.

How could Yang Kai lightly let them all leave? In this critical moment of life or death, every ally meant an extra thread of hope. Even if they were all merely at the True Yuan Realm, Yang Kai would not release them, let alone when they were Divine Roaming Realm cultivators.

So, although forcibly holding them under the pretense of those Ancestral Treasures might seem despicable, Yang Kai no longer cared for such trivialities.

Li Yuanchun had repeatedly brought up those treasures to Yang Kai. Seeing him again, Yang Kai assumed he was here to demand the Tai Yi Seal or other Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures and hastened to clarify his stance.

But Li Yuanchun smiled and waved his hand, “This time, I’m not here about the Ancestral Treasures.”

“Oh? Then what is it you wish to say?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows in surprise.

Li Yuanchun chuckled awkwardly and hesitated for a while before biting the bullet: “I wanted to ask if Young Master Yang could allow us overseas folk to soak in that pool as well?”

The miraculous pool water created by Xia Ningshang truly had tremendous efficacy. Cultivators at the True Yuan Realm who soaked in it for a few days would advance at least one small stage, sometimes three, with nearly daily breakthroughs happening within the pool.

Such a huge event at the estate naturally drew the attention and envy of those from overseas.

They all expressed a desire to enter the pool to purge their meridians and refine their marrow.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai had been in seclusion, and only today when Li Yuanchun sensed his emergence did he hasten to find him.

After finishing, Li Yuanchun quietly awaited Yang Kai’s reply, his heart aflutter, unsure whether Yang Kai would refuse. After all, these overseas people were strangers without familiarity or friendship, having come only to demand things from him.

It would be natural if he outright declined.

To everyone’s surprise, Yang Kai turned to Xia Ningshang and asked, “Does that water have any efficacy for Divine Roaming Realm experts?”

“It’s effective,” the Junior Sister nodded lightly, glancing at Li Yuanchun with a smile, “But for those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, it’s probably useless.”

“That’s fine by me,” Li Yuanchun quickly said, “I don’t need to enter then.”

“What about the materials? Are there enough?” Yang Kai inquired again.

Xia Ningshang pondered briefly, then softly nodded.

The herbal ingredients in the pool had to be refreshed every three days, consuming immense resources. In three days, the practitioners of one faction could nearly absorb all the medicinal power from the pool.

Replacing the batch guaranteed the next group might better purge their meridians and improve their physique.

“If there are enough, then arrange it for the overseas guests,” Yang Kai commanded.

Qiu Yimeng nodded, calculated quietly, and smiled at Li Yuanchun, “Senior, the overseas group will be the last batch to enter. But rest assured, even the last batch won’t affect the quality of the pool water in the slightest.”

Li Yuanchun was overjoyed, not expecting Yang Kai to be so accommodating. He had feared Yang Kai might refuse this time and hastened to say, “Many thanks, Young Master Yang.”

“No need for such formality,” Yang Kai smiled warmly and kindly. “From now on, we’re all one family. We must not forget our own when there is benefit.”

Li Yuanchun’s face twitched slightly. He thought that after this, he might feel too embarrassed to ask Yang Kai for the Tai Yi Seal again.

But it mattered little; having put his words out, Yang Kai would surely return those treasures—it was only a matter of timing.

During the past month Yang Kai had been in seclusion, the estate had seemingly erupted into a frenzy of cultivation. With safety no longer a concern, everyone naturally wanted to exert themselves to enhance their own defenses.

Not only were the major factions awaiting their turn to soak in the pool to improve their bodies, but Yang Kai's nine Blood Servants also entered seclusion.

Even Yang Wei, Yang Zhao, and their four Blood Servants who were rescued dared not slack off.

After a brief update with Qiu Yimeng on the estate’s happenings in the past month, Yang Kai felt gratified.

Despite the invasion from the Cangyun Evil Land, no one at the estate had lost hope; instead, they were actively seeking ways to survive.

After dealing with these matters, Yang Kai departed straight for Meng Wuya’s residence.

Only Ling Taixu, Earth Demon, and Shopkeeper Meng were inside Meng Wuya’s room.

The three often gathered to discuss the Daoist laws and the path to the peak. Ling Taixu had gained much insight from the others and seemed to have broken through anew. However, Meng Wuya and Earth Demon frequently differed in opinion, quarrelling heatedly.

The scene was lively.

When Yang Kai arrived, the two were again debating their perceptions while Ling Taixu listened smilingly from the side, drawing useful opinions.

“Different paths make shared progress impossible.” This perfectly described Meng Wuya and Earth Demon. Their Dao paths diverged, naturally causing disputes.

Yet despite different paths of cultivation, their ultimate goal was the same.

“Three gentlemen, your tastes are refined indeed,” Yang Kai laughed, then sat before them.

Meng Wuya and Earth Demon ceased their quarrel and glanced at him with suspicion and surprise. “You’ve broken through again?”

Since Yang Kai entered the Divine Roaming Realm, his power had advanced at an unprecedented speed. In less than ten days, he rose to the Second Stage within the Divine Roaming Realm, and after over a month, ascended to the Third.

Even the well-experienced Meng Wuya was amazed at Yang Kai’s rapid growth.

Yang Kai was instead surprised to see Earth Demon, and after careful sensing, his expression brightened. “Earth Demon, you’ve reached beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?”

Earth Demon chuckled, “With the great gifts the Young Master gave me, I could break through easily.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. Meng Wuya had mentioned Earth Demon already had a foundation beyond the Divine Roaming Realm and had understood its mysteries. But his current body’s constraints, damaged as it was, limited him to the Divine Roaming Realm’s peak level.

With the assistance of the Wan Yao Ling Paste, he surpassed everyone, breaking through beyond the Divine Roaming Realm with ease.

“What brings you here this time?” Meng Wuya asked.

Yang Kai straightened his expression, took a deep breath, and said, “Shopkeeper Meng, I remember over a month ago you praised Evil Lord Yang Bai as the number one under Heaven, correct?”

“That’s right,” Meng Wuya nodded with a serious face.

“Even you, without any seals on yourself, cannot match him?”

“Still almost a step short,” Meng Wuya slowly shook his head.

“Then I want to know—what level is Yang Bai really at? And what level is the lot of you who are beyond the Divine Roaming Realm? You are all called beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, but why is there such a great difference in strength? What exactly is this realm beyond Divine Roaming?” Yang Kai asked a series of questions, probing a mystery that had long clouded his mind.

The three exchanged glances.

Meng Wuya sighed lightly. “I’d hoped not to let you know about this realm so soon. The more you know, the harder it becomes for your current self to develop.”

“Afraid I’ll grow too haughty?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

“Afraid you’ll be discouraged,” Meng Wuya smiled. “But now it seems it is time for you to understand what kind of enemies you face.”

After some thought, Meng Wuya seemed to consider how to best explain it, then finally spoke, “People call the realm beyond the Divine Roaming Realm simply ‘beyond the Divine Roaming Realm’ because they don’t know its real name. Now, I can tell you, it’s not really called that. That title is just your designation for the top-tier strongs. It does have a true name.”

Yang Kai’s breath caught, quietly sensing that Meng Wuya was about to reveal a secret that had puzzled the world for thousands of years.

“The realm beyond the Divine Roaming Realm is called the Transcendent Realm!” Meng Wuya said solemnly.

“Transcendent Realm?”

“It is a realm transcending the mortal level, thus called Transcendent. Once reached, one is no longer a mortal, having shed mortal troubles and constraints.”

“How so?”

“For Transcendent Realm strongs, anyone below the Divine Roaming Realm is a mere mortal—just as cultivators compare to ordinary people. Facing a Transcendent Realm expert, fighters below Divine Roaming have virtually no ability to resist.”

Yang Kai furrowed his brow, feeling Meng Wuya’s explanation was too vague. He did not yet grasp the full mysteries hidden in the Transcendent Realm. Perhaps only when he truly ascended could he understand even a bit.

“The ones you have seen beyond the Divine Roaming Realm are all Transcendent Realm experts. But unlike the Divine Roaming Realm, the Transcendent Realm is not divided so intricately—there aren’t nine Stages. When one reaches this level, further breakthroughs are extremely difficult, but each one brings enormous strength gain.”

“Oh, how is it divided then?” Yang Kai asked with interest.

“Only three Stages!”

“Three Stages?” Yang Kai was stunned.

“The First, Second, and Third Stages of the Transcendent Realm!” Meng Wuya explained, “Those eight from Fengshen Hall you have seen are all at the First Stage. Nine-tenths of the Transcendent Realm experts in your Eight Great Families and across the land remain at the First Stage—they simply cannot comprehend more profound secrets of the martial Dao and Heavenly Dao, and so their achievements end there in their lifetime.”

Meng Wuya smiled lightly, “But Li Yuanchun at the estate has some base. He is probably at the limit of the First Stage, stronger than ordinary First-Stage experts. Without guidance, however, this is likely his final achievement, and he will never break through to the Second Stage.”
