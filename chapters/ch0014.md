## Chapter 14 — The Incense Burner

Yang Kai continued cultivating until the time to extinguish the lamps. Only then did he reluctantly stop. Despite the long hours of practicing fists and kicks, he felt no fatigue; instead, his spirit shone brightly, and his strength seemed boundless. Ever since attaining the Proud Bone Golden Body, his stamina had improved greatly. Today, he had walked twenty li without tiring, and carrying that heavy sack of rice felt as light as a feather.

Only when cultivating the Body Tempering Chapter did he truly feel pressure. Thinking back to this morning’s session, Yang Kai shuddered involuntarily—the sensation of the heavens pressing down upon him was unbearably oppressive.

Yet, it was precisely this pressure that brought progress. Without pressure, how could one cultivate?

A person’s potential was always forced out, and a martial artist’s growth was no different. Step by step, pushing one’s limits, bit by bit surpassing one’s boundaries—that was how strength was gained.

But now, after throwing so many punches and kicks, he felt no weariness at all. How could he have reached his limits, and how could he force out his potential?

This was a difficult problem. Yang Kai was somewhat frustrated. Attaining the Proud Bone Golden Body was indeed a great blessing, but with its powerful restorative ability, the foundational exercises of Lingxiao Pavilion could no longer challenge him. Was he destined to only train for half an hour before sunrise every day?

A full day had twelve hours; training for only half an hour left the rest of the time to be wasted. Should he just bury his head in sleep? Absolutely not. Yang Kai dismissed this thought without hesitation.

While absentmindedly lighting a fire to cook, he pondered how to create pressure for himself. If others knew, they would surely find it laughable.

Other martial artists longed for an easier path, but Yang Kai was deliberately courting hardship.

After much thought, no good solution came to mind. The main reason was his current financial situation. Many pills could assist cultivation at the Body Tempering Realm, and besides pills, there were other external methods—but all of these required one thing: money.

Within Lingxiao Pavilion, money meant Contribution Points. Unfortunately, Yang Kai had only twelve points, far too few to make a difference.

After cooking, Yang Kai wolfed down several bowls of plain rice—no dishes to accompany it—but he was content. This was the only full meal he had eaten in days.

After eating, he did not continue cultivating. Instead, he took a bath and lay down. Continuing to train without progress would only waste effort; it was better to think of a solution first. Sharpening the axe before chopping wood.

As he contemplated, an idea struck him. He summoned the Wordless Black Book once more.

Yang Kai had roughly grasped the nature of this black book. Each page contained a sealed item that could be summoned once his strength reached a certain level.

The first page had granted him the Proud Bone Golden Body—his foundation and root.

The second page was the Body Tempering Chapter, tailored to cultivate the Proud Bone Golden Body.

The third page remained a mystery, for last night, when he tried to peer into it, nothing appeared. This was undoubtedly related to his strength.

Now that the first and second pages were empty, Yang Kai studied them carefully but found nothing new. However, when he inadvertently flipped to the third page, his vision blurred.

“Hm?” Yang Kai furrowed his brow and stared intently at the third page.

In an instant, golden light flickered across the page. Countless golden shadows surged forth, leaping directly into Yang Kai’s mind. Then, a vortex slowly appeared on the page’s surface, within which rose an ancient, fragrant incense burner.

This sudden change left Yang Kai momentarily stunned. Once he understood, his joy was boundless.

Of course! He had broken through to the fourth stage of the Body Tempering Realm this morning. Last night, he couldn’t see the secret of the third page, but now, after the breakthrough, why hadn’t he tried?

Though only a single stage difference, it was enough to block his view of the third page’s mysteries.

Realizing this, Yang Kai felt a twinge of regret. Had he checked earlier, perhaps he wouldn’t have had to rack his brain now.

Suppressing his excitement, Yang Kai took the incense burner in hand and examined it carefully.

The burner was not large, resembling an ordinary household incense vessel. It was semi-enclosed, with a lid perforated by several small holes. Its antique style was unremarkable, so it would attract no attention wherever placed.

Yang Kai sniffed lightly but detected no scent. It was also surprisingly light.

What was its purpose? For a moment, Yang Kai was puzzled. He had no choice but to close his eyes and concentrate, reviewing the information that had flooded his mind moments ago.

After a brief moment, Yang Kai opened his eyes with a strange expression.

According to the information, this incense burner was meant to assist cultivation. The burner itself had no effect; it required certain herbs to be placed inside and burned to produce a special fragrance. This fragrance was the true aid to cultivation.

Different realms required different herbs to be placed in the burner.

What puzzled Yang Kai was that the herbs suitable for his current realm were the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower and the Desolate Deadwood Herb.

From what Yang Kai knew, these two herbs were not particularly valuable, only somewhat rare. They also possessed mild toxicity. Though the poison was slight, long-term inhalation of their medicinal properties could harm a person.

Could these herbs really aid his cultivation?

The Contribution Hall surely stocked these herbs, but with Shopkeeper Meng’s habit of squeezing every last coin, their price would be exorbitant. Yang Kai had barely any Contribution Points to spare.

Thus, he would have to find these herbs himself. Fortunately, the Black Wind Mountains lay not far from Lingxiao Pavilion. Having hunted there many times, Yang Kai was familiar with the terrain. Perhaps the herbs grew there.

Tomorrow, he would enter the mountains! Resolving this, all his worries vanished, and he soon fell into a deep sleep. Before sleeping, he checked the fourth page of the Wordless Black Book, to avoid another awkward situation like today. However, the fourth page remained inert—his strength at Body Tempering Realm Stage Four was still insufficient to glimpse it.

The next day, Yang Kai rose early.

Having reaped such great benefits from yesterday’s Body Tempering Chapter cultivation, he naturally craved more. Besides, he was not a lazy man.

As the purple light of dawn rose in the east, the slow yet profound techniques of the Body Tempering Chapter gradually unfolded.

Though his cultivation level was higher than yesterday, today’s practice showed little progress. After half an hour, he remained at only one-twentieth completion. However, his body was sore and aching, bones cracking like the sound of snapping beans in rapid succession.

Drawing in a mouthful of purple qi, the faint qi sense within grew clearer and denser. His meridians seemed to have expanded greatly, and his skin exuded many acquired impurities.
