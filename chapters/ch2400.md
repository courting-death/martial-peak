## Chapter 2400 — Why Insist?

Fan Xin had no idea why her Honored Master would give such an order, since these disciples of Ice Heart Pavilion had basically never been out to sea, nor did they have any need to.

What surprised her even more was that Honored Master actually put Yang Kai in charge of everything, instructing her and the others to follow his commands.

Yang Kai hadn’t been at Ice Heart Pavilion for long, yet he had already earned such great trust from Honored Master, who even entrusted several Senior Sisters to his care. Fan Xin truly didn’t know what Yang Kai had done to make Honored Master confide in him so deeply.

Still, despite her doubts, Fan Xin dared not disobey Honored Master’s command in the slightest.

“Let’s wait here for a while,” Yang Kai said, glancing toward the city gate.

“Alright.” Fan Xin didn’t ask further, simply nodded lightly, and found a place to stand quietly.

Not long after, Yang Kai suddenly saw several familiar figures approaching from the city gate, and couldn’t help but smile knowingly.

“Big Sister Ling?” As soon as Liu Qianyun saw Ling Yinqin arrive, she understood what Yang Kai was waiting for and hurried over to greet her.

After some brief greetings, Ling Yinqin walked up to Yang Kai with a grave expression and said, “Senior Brother Yang, we’ll go with you.”

“Alright.” Yang Kai nodded with a smile. “I promise you won’t be disappointed!”

Scanning the group, he noticed that only about half of Ling Yinqin’s crew had gathered here, with the rest nowhere to be seen. It was clear that even with Ling Yinqin’s prestige, she couldn’t get all her crew to trust Yang Kai.

Jiao Yi, who had come along with Ling Yinqin, winked at Yang Kai and said, “Brother Yang, we’re putting our lives in your hands, so don’t let anything go wrong.”

Yang Kai replied, “You’ll see for yourselves soon enough. Let’s board the ship and set out.”

The dock was bustling with people, and multi-deck ships were everywhere. So, Yang Kai’s group boarding a ship and leaving wasn’t anything out of the ordinary.

Moments later, everyone was sailing on the vast sea, gradually moving farther from Tongtian Island.

Although these disciples of Ice Heart Pavilion had little experience at sea and knew nothing about sailing, Ling Yinqin and her crew were all veterans. The multi-deck ship sailed smoothly, cutting through the waves.

After a day, the ship was already more than a hundred and fifty thousand li from Tongtian Island.

Worried, Fan Xin came up to the deck to find Yang Kai and asked, “Pillmaster Yang, where is Honored Master? Why hasn’t she shown up yet?”

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, “The Pavilion Master’s means are extraordinary. There’s no need to worry. She needs to shake someone off before she can join us.”

“Shake someone off?” Fan Xin raised her delicate brows at his words. She seemed to understand and nodded before leaving.

Just then, Yang Kai suddenly sensed something and turned his head to look to the side, only to see a streak of rainbow light racing toward them from the distant horizon. Though it started far away, it arrived in the blink of an eye.

The rainbow light landed on the deck, the glow faded, and Bing Yun’s figure appeared.

“Who goes there!” Ling Yinqin and the others were shocked, shouting in alarm. On the open sea, someone suddenly boarding the ship without warning was a grave taboo, so they immediately went on guard.

But as their Divine Senses swept over and sensed Bing Yun’s unfathomable depth, their expressions changed again, and none dared to act rashly.

Although they couldn’t gauge Bing Yun’s true strength, the immense pressure radiating from her was real. A brief probe made their qi and blood churn and left them breathless—this was a powerhouse they absolutely couldn’t afford to provoke.

“Senior, you’ve arrived.” Yang Kai cupped his fists toward Bing Yun.

Bing Yun nodded lightly.

“Honored Master!” Fan Xin and the others hurried over to pay their respects, each one visibly excited, as if they had found their pillar of support.

“Senior… Honored Master…” Ling Yinqin and the others were completely dumbfounded.

Yang Kai was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. For someone he called ‘Senior’ to appear, it could only be an Emperor Realm expert. Ling Yinqin also knew Fan Xin was from Ice Heart Pavilion, and now, hearing Fan Xin call this young woman Honored Master, Ling Yinqin immediately realized her identity.

This young woman was actually the famous Pavilion Master of Ice Heart Pavilion! The only top expert on Tongtian Island who could stand on equal footing with the Island Lord!

Realizing this, Ling Yinqin and the others were all inexplicably excited, their eyes filled with admiration and reverence as they looked at Bing Yun. Their confidence in Yang Kai also grew considerably.

If Ling Yinqin had chosen to leave with Yang Kai before only because she didn’t want to stay on Tongtian Island any longer and decided to take a gamble, now they truly saw hope.

With someone as powerful as the Pavilion Master of Ice Heart Pavilion on board, what did they have to worry about?

“Are these your friends?” Bing Yun glanced at Ling Yinqin and the others and asked.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “When Junior Sister and I first arrived, we received much kindness from Big Sister Ling and the others, so I invited them to come along this time.”

Bing Yun nodded and said, “You know how to repay kindness. They’re lucky to have met you.”

Seeing Bing Yun address her, Ling Yinqin hurried forward, so nervous that sweat beaded on her nose, and said respectfully, “Junior Ling Yinqin greets the Pavilion Master.”

Jiao Yi and the others also quickly paid their respects, standing straight and not daring to show the slightest disrespect.

“Since you’re Yang Kai’s friends, we’re all on the same side. No need for such formalities,” Bing Yun said calmly.

“Thank you, Pavilion Master!” Ling Yinqin said gratefully, her heart full of surprise. She had never expected the elusive master of Ice Heart Pavilion to be so approachable. Even more astonishing was how Yang Kai spoke so easily in front of her, completely at ease and conversing without the slightest hint of pressure. Ling Yinqin couldn’t help but wonder how he managed to maintain such a calm and transcendent demeanor.

Comparing herself to Yang Kai, Ling Yinqin realized she was far inferior.

“Senior, did you shake off that old toad?” Yang Kai asked.

According to the plan he and Bing Yun had made, he would take everyone out to sea first, and only then would Bing Yun leave Tongtian Island. Once she left, Chi Ri would surely notice and give chase.

Bing Yun’s task was to lead Chi Ri in circles outside, then find a chance to shake him off before coming to meet up with Yang Kai.

Now that Bing Yun had appeared here, Chi Ri had undoubtedly been left behind.

Bing Yun nodded, but just as she was about to answer, her expression suddenly darkened. She looked up in a certain direction and said through gritted teeth, “You just won’t give up until you see the coffin!”

As soon as she finished speaking, a sudden thunderclap exploded in the sky, deafening to the ears. With the roar, a mass of fiery red light abruptly appeared in the sky, like a blazing sun rising, so bright that no one could keep their eyes open.

At the same time, an overwhelming pressure radiated out. The force was so strong it felt as if the sky itself was collapsing, making it hard to breathe.

Everyone on the ship turned pale, all equally shocked.

As the light faded, two figures suddenly appeared there.

One of them stood tall and imposing, exuding authority. Whatever he had just experienced, there was a faint trace of anger on his face. The other stood half a step behind him, like a servant, smiling obsequiously and standing respectfully.

“City Lord!” Ling Yinqin’s face went pale as she looked at the stern-faced middle-aged man.

Although she had never seen Chi Ri in person, she had seen his portrait, so she immediately recognized the expert chasing them as the City Lord of Tongtian City.

“Pang Guang!” Yang Kai was utterly shocked, staring at the figure behind Chi Ri, his eyes nearly popping out.

He never expected Pang Guang to be allied with Chi Ri, and judging by his appearance, it seemed he had already been subdued. The last time Yang Kai saw him, Pang Guang was seriously injured and hoping to get the Butian Lotus from him to recover. Now, though he still didn’t look fully healed, he was clearly much better—probably thanks to some spiritual pill or miraculous medicine.

But since he had already been subdued by Chi Ri, it wasn’t surprising that he’d gotten some healing medicine from him.

Pang Guang’s gaze passed over everyone and fixed on Yang Kai, his expression filled with venomous hatred.

If not for Yang Kai, he wouldn’t have ended up in such a miserable state. Even though his strength was far below Chi Ri’s, he was still an Emperor Realm expert and had his own dignity. If he hadn’t been forced into a corner, how could he have sought refuge with Chi Ri?

The other two First Stage Emperor Realm experts on Tongtian Island were also under Chi Ri’s control, but their situation was much better—they at least had their freedom.

And the one responsible for all this was Yang Kai! If he had handed over the Butian Lotus back then, Pang Guang wouldn’t have ended up like this, with his life and death out of his own hands and even his freedom lost.

So when it came to hatred, Pang Guang’s resentment toward Yang Kai was as deep as the Jixu Sea itself.

“Bing Yun!” Chi Ri suddenly shouted, his voice booming and echoing in all directions. Sensing his suppressed anger, even the sea began to churn, with waves rising over ten zhang high. “Why are you in such a hurry? Where are you going?”

Bing Yun stood alone, looking up at Chi Ri. With a wave of her hand, she dispersed his overwhelming aura and said calmly, “Where I go is my own business, City Lord. Why do you care?”

Chi Ri’s expression darkened and he snorted coldly. “Bing Yun, are you thinking of leaving this place?”

“Why bother asking what you already know?” Bing Yun replied coldly, clearly not wanting to waste words with him.

“You really want to leave?” Although Chi Ri had suspected as much, hearing Bing Yun admit it still made him furious and heartbroken, as if she had abandoned him. The feeling left him unsettled. Suppressing his anger, he took a deep breath and said, “Bing Yun, you and I both know that leaving this place is just a fantasy. Why insist? I can let bygones be bygones today. As long as you’re willing to come back and become my partner, we can live freely in this Jixu Secret Realm. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?”

Bing Yun shook her head and said, “You know it’s just a fantasy, so why insist? I don’t want to be your enemy, nor do I wish to fight you. You should go back.”

Chi Ri roared, “You insist on being so stubborn? Aren’t you afraid I’ll send everyone on this ship to the bottom of the sea!”
