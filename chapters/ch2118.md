## Chapter 2118 — Red-Clothed Woman

The next morning, Yang Kai arrived early at the Qin Family compound.

Qin Chaoyang had already made all the preparations. Seeing Yang Kai arrive as promised, he was naturally delighted. After a brief exchange of courtesies, he said to him, “Brother Yang, before you depart, this old man has something to entrust to you.”

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked.

Qin Chaoyang gestured to the side, and Qin Yu, who had been waiting respectfully nearby, stepped forward carrying a wooden box in both hands. When she stopped in front of Yang Kai, she smiled at him.

Yang Kai glanced at the wooden box and found it was long, about four zhang in length. The material was extraordinary and mysterious; intricate patterns were carved on its surface.

From inside the box, an unusual energy fluctuation emanated.

“Hm?” Yang Kai frowned, instinctively sensing that the item inside the box was no ordinary thing.

He looked at Qin Chaoyang, who nodded, signaling him to open it and take a look.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai reached out and opened the wooden box.

A sword light shimmered out, making Yang Kai squint. When he saw the item inside, he couldn’t help but exclaim, “This is…”

As he spoke, he reached in and took out the long sword from the box, calling out in a low voice, “Imperial Treasure?”

The sword was over three zhang long, four fingers wide, and the blade was thick and heavy. Both sides of the blade were smooth and unadorned, except for a word engraved on the hilt.

“Myriad!”

“One sword drawn, it blocks a myriad. This is the Myriad Sword left behind by our Qin Family’s ancestor!” Qin Chaoyang explained solemnly from the side.

Yang Kai raised his brows. “Myriad Sword? What a domineering name!”

As he spoke, the sword’s body soared. When he urged his Origin Qi, the long sword hummed and trembled.

It was as if the heroic spirit that had slumbered for countless years was awakened again. Light flowed across the blade, and sword energy hissed sharply.

Seeing this, Qin Chaoyang’s eyes narrowed slightly. He felt a bit disappointed, yet also shocked, and said, “Brother Yang, your strength truly surpasses mine. You can draw out the sword’s power without even refining it!”

This was, after all, an Imperial Treasure. Even though it had slept for countless years, it was not something an ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator could wield. Even if Qin Chaoyang poured all his Origin Qi into the blade, he might not be able to elicit any reaction.

What surprised Qin Chaoyang even more was that, upon learning this was an Imperial Treasure, Yang Kai showed no sign of shock or excitement. It was as if, in his eyes, this was just an ordinary item.

“Brother Qin, what does this mean?” Yang Kai casually spun the sword in a few flourishes, then turned to look at Qin Chaoyang.

Qin Chaoyang smiled slightly and said, “If you want a horse to run, you have to let it eat grass…”

Before he finished, Qin Yu shot him a reproachful glare.

“A slip of the tongue, a slip of the tongue…” Qin Chaoyang said awkwardly, then continued seriously, “Take this sword for self-defense, Brother Yang. The Four Seasons Realm… is not a peaceful place.”

Yang Kai said, “Brother Qin, aren’t you afraid I’ll run off with it?”

Qin Yu interjected, “If Lord Yang truly did that, it would be this sword’s honor. This sword has been passed down from our ancestor to the present generation of the Qin Family, left buried for countless years. I think… it also hopes to find a better master, begin a new journey, and display its brilliance.”

Yang Kai shot her a look, thinking to himself that this little lass was quick-witted and had a way with words.

But after Qin Yu’s words, even if he had such thoughts, he would feel embarrassed to actually take it. Besides, he never intended to claim it for himself.

Imperial Treasures were rare, but it wasn’t as if he didn’t have any—he had more than one…

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai said, “I’ll accept the Myriad Sword for now. Once I leave the Four Seasons Realm, I’ll return it to your Qin Family.”

Qin Yu smiled and handed over a jade slip. “This is the secret method our ancestor left for refining the Myriad Sword. It might be helpful to Lord Yang.”

Yang Kai nodded and accepted it, not examining it closely, but directly storing the jade slip and the Myriad Sword in his Spatial Ring.

“Well then… let’s set out.” Qin Chaoyang said with a wave.

Yang Kai nodded and left with him.

“Lord Yang…” Qin Yu called out from behind, “Above all, keep yourself safe!”

Yang Kai didn’t look back, only waved his hand from afar…

Leaving Fenglin City, Yang Kai immediately summoned the tower-ship he’d obtained from Fei Sheng Palace. After he and Qin Chaoyang boarded, he activated the Secret Treasure’s power and sped forward.

Fenglin City had a Space Array, but after the siege by Demonic Qi last time, the Drunken Old Man smashed it to pieces. It won’t be rebuilt anytime soon. This had to be reported to Star God Palace or one of the great Sects, asking them to send people to set up a new one.

Of course, Yang Kai could help, but he was unwilling to do so.

His current strength was still low, and the fewer people who knew he was proficient in Space Power, the better.

The tower-ship flew at great speed. Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang took turns steering, so it wasn’t too tiring.

Along the way, Qin Chaoyang found time to explain the details of the Four Seasons Realm and some things to watch out for. Yang Kai kept it all in mind.

According to Qin Chaoyang, the entrance to the Four Seasons Realm was in a valley in the Southern Territory. It would open automatically at intervals, and each opening lasted only thirty-three days. After thirty-three days, all outsiders would be expelled by the secret realm’s power and teleported out.

The Four Seasons Realm was so named because its environment was extremely peculiar, divided into four major regions corresponding to the seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The Spring Domain was always filled with birdsong and flowers, the Summer Domain was perpetually blazing hot, the Autumn Domain was clear and refreshing, and the Winter Domain was covered in white snow…

The Four Seasons Realm contained many heaven-and-earth treasures and rare Spiritual Herbs seldom seen in the Star Realm, and even other opportunities. Disciples of the major Sects entered to search specific regions according to their cultivation methods and needs.

Since Yang Kai was going to search for the Calamity Fruit, he naturally had to go to the Winter Domain, because only the Winter Domain’s icy environment was suitable for such a spiritual fruit to grow.

The opening of the Four Seasons Realm was not only an opportunity for the major Sects of the Southern Territory to obtain rare resources, but also a chance for them to compete in secret. So they allowed their disciples to fight and kill inside, using it to test their disciples’ cultivation results.

For this reason, even if the disciples sent in by the major Sects weren’t the very best, they were all elite. Every round of fighting was unimaginably fierce, and the casualty rate often exceeded forty percent.

Qin Chaoyang wasn’t from any major Sect and had never entered the Four Seasons Realm. Everything he knew came from records Qin Yu had read in various ancient texts, or from information passed down by word of mouth.

So when Yang Kai actually entered, he would have to judge the situation for himself.

The journey was uneventful.

Besides chatting with Qin Chaoyang, Yang Kai spent his time studying the jade slip on refining the Myriad Sword.

He gained some insights.

Although he had quite a few Imperial Treasures, the Myriad Sword was a sword artifact and an Imperial Treasure. Studying its refining method might lead to other realizations.

Five days later, the tower-ship sped across a desolate wilderness.

While sitting in one of the cabins refining the Myriad Sword, Yang Kai suddenly felt something; his heart skipped a beat and he abruptly opened his eyes, focusing on a spot in the void.

Qin Chaoyang seemed to sense it too and stopped the tower-ship in midair.

Then Qin Chaoyang’s voice came from the front, “May I ask who you are, and why do you block our way?”

As he called out, Yang Kai had already darted over from behind. Fixing his gaze ahead, he saw a fiery-red figure a hundred zhang in front of the tower-ship, standing with her back to them.

That figure was like a burning flame. Though her face was unclear, her graceful figure and long hair, which reached her hips, made it obvious she was a woman.

“What’s going on?” Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

Qin Chaoyang shook his head. “This woman suddenly appeared ahead. I don’t know if she was already here or what…”

Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense over and murmured, "Profound and unfathomable…" His expression changed slightly.

When he swept his Divine Sense there was actually no presence; if not for his eyes seeing the red-clothed woman’s figure, he might not have noticed her at all.

“Is that… Emperor Realm?” Qin Chaoyang exclaimed, a chill rising from the depths of his heart.

“And not an ordinary Emperor Realm!” Yang Kai swallowed.

When he was entangled by demonic intent, he had fought with three First Stage Emperor Realm experts, so he had some understanding of their abilities. But the feeling this red-clothed woman gave him was that even those three combined couldn’t compare.

In other words, this red-clothed woman was at least a Second Stage Emperor, and very likely even a Third Stage!

Thinking of this, Yang Kai’s heart sank.

No matter what this woman was doing here, if she was angered, he and Qin Chaoyang might both meet their end here!

“Brother Yang… do you know her?”

“How would I know?” Yang Kai retorted.

After thinking for a moment, he called out, “May I ask this honored one’s name, and why do you block our way?”

As he spoke, the woman slowly turned half her body, glancing over with a sidelong look.

Jade nose and red lips, brows like a painting, black hair flying, a graceful figure, proud chest, skin as smooth as jade, white as snow, unstained by dust… Especially those limpid eyes, as if they could speak. When she looked over, even an old man like Qin Chaoyang was dazed, momentarily lost in her beauty.

“So slow.” The woman murmured softly. Although Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang were both highly cultivated and had keen hearing, they couldn’t make out her words, not knowing if she used some mysterious power.

After speaking, the red-clothed woman’s lips curled in a half-smile as she gazed at the tower-ship.

Yang Kai’s whole body stiffened!

For no reason, he felt as if the woman’s gaze pierced through the void and the tower-ship’s barrier, landing directly on him. He became extremely alert, quietly urging his Origin Qi and rapidly trying to recall when he had met her before or where he might have offended her!
