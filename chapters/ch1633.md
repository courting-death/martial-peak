## Chapter 1633 — I Will Go

Su Yan and Qing Ya actually joined Ice Heart Valley!

How fickle the world can be.

Years ago, when the Imperial Garden party traveled together, Yang Kai had already tangled with people from Ice Heart Valley; after he unintentionally arrived at Chi Lan Star he learned that Ice Heart Valley was a powerful force.

Yet he never imagined that Su Yan and Qing Ya would actually become members of Ice Heart Valley.

Had he known earlier, he would have gone searching for them long before now.

Ice Heart Valley only accepts female disciples, and it is renowned for ice-based cultivation methods and secret techniques—truly a perfect fit for Su Yan and Qing Ya, since the Ice Sect they once belonged to shared identical principles with Ice Heart Valley.

“Su Yan misses you greatly, but she cannot return to Tongxuan Continent; she kept telling me that once she is capable of traversing Star Domains by herself, she will surely return to find you,” Qing Ya said as she looked at Yang Kai, believing he had remained on Tongxuan Continent all these years.

“I know. I have been looking for her these years as well.” Yang Kai smiled faintly; as he was about to ask Qing Ya further about Su Yan’s situation, his brow suddenly knit and he said, “This is no place to talk—let us leave.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai swept out his hand; Saint Yuan wrapped Qing Ya, and with her enclosed he vanished from that spot.

After a dozen or so breaths, a group of seven or eight cultivators arrived at the spot, glancing about; their leader frowned in puzzlement, “There were people here a moment ago—how did they suddenly vanish?”

“Perhaps they sensed our presence and ran,” someone guessed.

“Hmph, never mind that—reinforcing our sect’s disciples is the priority.” The leader waved his great hand and led the others toward the battlefield.

Tens of thousands of li from that battlefield, in a small city Yang Kai and Qing Ya rented a room in an inn and took an upper chamber.

In the room Yang Kai carefully questioned Qing Ya about Su Yan’s circumstances over the years.

Only after learning that Su Yan was safe, had not only entered Ice Heart Valley but become a disciple under Great Elder Ran Yunting and been highly valued, did Yang Kai finally relax.

Ice Heart Valley had a Void King Realm expert fighting for it and was not a minor power; Great Elder Ran Yunting’s cultivation must be high indeed. For Su Yan to enter her tutelage was a great blessing.

Yang Kai felt a faint gratitude toward Ran Yunting.

If not for her meticulous guidance, Su Yan could not possibly have reached the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm in such a short time!

Xia Ningshang had refined the Stellar Origin of Tongxuan Continent to achieve her realm, yet Su Yan rose through cultivation alone to stand shoulder to shoulder with Xia Ningshang—such talent was extraordinary.

Indeed, Qing Ya even told him that Su Yan had already begun preparing to break through to the Second Stage.

From his heart Yang Kai rejoiced for her!

As for how she managed to enter Ice Heart Valley, there was some luck involved.

Qing Ya said that after they parted from Qian Yue they traveled through the Void Passage to Cuiwei Star; she, Su Yan, and Qian Hao worked hard there for a time, but their cultivation was so low—only Second or Third Stages of the Saint Realm—that they could not earn enough Saint Crystals or Spiritual Pills to support their training.

Until they met Ran Yunting by chance.

Ran Yunting had come to Cuiwei Star for reasons unknown; upon seeing Su Yan she was overjoyed and immediately said she would bring her back to Ice Heart Valley to cultivate her.

Such a boon, how could the three refuse?

After carefully investigating Ice Heart Valley’s reputation, Su Yan and Qing Ya resolutely decided to join; as for Qian Hao, being male he could not enter.

However, Ran Yunting arranged for Qian Hao as well, placing him in a sect affiliated with Ice Heart Valley, and he now possessed cultivation at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm.

Hearing Qing Ya’s account, Yang Kai’s expression grew strange.

“So you really went to Cuiwei Star.” He forced a bitter smile.

Qian Yue had remained on Cuiwei Star so long yet could not uncover any trace of Su Yan and the others—turns out she had simply arrived too late.

Had she gone two or three decades earlier she may have met them, but by the time Qian Yue arrived, Su Yan and company had already left for Chi Lan Star.

“Oh—by the way, Qian Yue misses you all.”

“You met Qian Yue? Is she well?” Qing Ya asked in delight; after they separated years ago she had not known Qian Yue’s fate and had worried, so Yang Kai’s news filled her with joy.

“If you want to know how she is, ask her yourself.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“Ask her myself?” Qing Ya’s brows knit; she did not understand what Yang Kai meant.

Yang Kai closed his eyes and used Divine Sense to contact the Xuan Realm Pearl, locating Qian Yue’s trace; confirming she was not in seclusion, he spoke to her and with a wave released her from the Xuan Realm Pearl.

“What is it?” Qian Yue appeared, bewildered.

“See who this is,” Yang Kai said with a smile, pointing behind her.

Qian Yue turned; her eyes widened and tears sprang to her lashes as she trembled, calling out, “Sect Master!”

“Qian Yue—” Qing Ya could not contain her own excitement.

The Star Domain may be wondrous, but it could never erase their longing for old acquaintances. In the Ice Sect on Tongxuan Continent Qing Ya and Qian Yue had been as close as sisters; after decades apart, this reunion overwhelmed them.

Both women’s eyes reddened.

They exchanged greetings and confirmed each other’s safety and great advances in cultivation, scarcely able to conceal their joy.

“Yang Kai, you actually found the Sect Master!” Qian Yue looked at Yang Kai with deep gratitude. Ever since meeting him on Dark Star, she had made it her mission to find Qing Ya and the others—this goal had long since become an obsession weighing on her heart.

Today Yang Kai fulfilled her wish!

“Su Yan? My brother? Are they all right?” Qian Yue asked anxiously.

“Su Yan is fine. Your brother Qian Hao is doing well in a sect called Phantom God Sect; you need not worry.” Qing Ya comforted her.

“That’s good, that’s good.” Tears wet Qian Yue’s cheeks as she smiled through her joy.

“Come, tell me about these years. I’ve already told Yang Kai our story.” Qing Ya took Qian Yue’s hand and sat her down to inquire.

Qian Yue answered everything in detail.

When she learned Qian Yue had nearly been forced into a brothel she saw Qing Ya’s usually cold face harden with frost; Qing Ya cast Yang Kai a grateful glance.

Upon hearing that Yang Kai had almost unified a Cultivation Star, Qing Ya was utterly shocked.

Even if that Cultivation Star lacked a Void King Realm presence, to unify it was no simple feat—it demanded overwhelming advantage and immense personal charisma.

Time slipped by as the two women, reunited after so long, seemed to have endless things to say.

Yang Kai did not interrupt; he sat quietly to the side and listened.

At dusk Qing Ya seemed to come back to herself and cast Yang Kai an embarrassed look. “We may have talked for too long.”

“Senior Qing Ya, you worry too much. I completely understand.”

Were he reunited with Su Yan he would likely be just as overeager.

“Your cultivation far surpasses mine now, so don’t call me senior.” Qing Ya smiled as she pursed her lips. “Besides, you are now a Sect Master—your status is incomparable to mine. If you keep calling me senior I will be mortified.”

“Senior is senior.” Yang Kai shook his head; he never felt increased strength permitted him to slight his elders.

“If you don’t mind, you may call me Senior Sister,” Qing Ya said with a gentle smile. “Su Yan and I are now fellow disciples of the same Sect, Senior and Junior Sisters in name. This is the Star Domain, no longer the Tongxuan Continent—there’s no need to dwell on the past. We should all look forward.”

Yang Kai nodded. “Then I will follow Su Yan and call you Senior Sister.”

“That will do.” Qing Ya nodded and thought of Su Yan with a knowing smile. “Su Yan should already know of your arrival. Although she resides in the inner island and cultivates in seclusion, I left her a letter before I left; she reads it once every month, so when she sees it she would know you reached Chi Lan Star.”

“May I enter Ice Heart Valley?” Yang Kai asked with hopeful eyes.

“You want to go?” Qing Ya frowned. “Ice Heart Valley has treated Su Yan and me kindly, but this time their disciples mobilized in force to search for you. I do not know the reason; if you appear in Ice Heart Valley voluntarily, who knows what might happen.”

“Can Su Yan leave Ice Heart Valley?” Yang Kai asked again.

Qing Ya shook her head. “The Great Elder has high hopes for Su Yan. This is a critical moment as Su Yan prepares to break to the Second Stage, and with the conflicts between Ice Heart Valley and Fire Radiance Sect growing frequent, the Great Elder will not permit Su Yan to depart now.”

“Then I will go!” Yang Kai said in a low voice.

“You—” Qing Ya opened her mouth as if to persuade him, but once she saw his resolute expression she knew her words would be useless; she sighed, “Allow me to consider.”

Yang Kai nodded and did not press her.

After a long while Qing Ya sighed and looked up at Yang Kai. “If you want to enter Ice Heart Valley you must expose your identity so they bring you in—otherwise you cannot enter. Ice Heart Valley has never allowed men to set foot within; in ten thousand years there has been no exception!”

“If I expose myself, will they actively welcome me?” Yang Kai raised his brow.

“I’m not certain, for I do not know why Ice Heart Valley seeks you. But this time the commotion is great. If the Great Elder and Sect Master value you highly, it is possible.”

“Then expose me!” Yang Kai grinned. “I’ll trouble Senior Sister Qing Ya for this.”

“You are not troubling me—only that I must report it, and a high-level sect member will come to escort you.” Qing Ya’s expression grew serious. “However, think carefully: if you truly enter Ice Heart Valley no one can predict what will happen.”

“It matters not; I only wish to see Su Yan once.” Yang Kai nodded calmly.

“Very well—since you have decided, I will contact them.” Qing Ya nodded and drew a Transmission Compass from her spatial ring, pouring Divine Sense into it.

After a moment a clear Divine Sense fluctuation came from the Transmission Compass.
