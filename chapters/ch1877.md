## Chapter 1877 — Overpowering

The situation shifted abruptly. So many strange and fantastical creatures suddenly appeared above Purple Star Palace that everyone was left dazzled, momentarily at a loss for what to do.

"Roar..."

A roar echoed through the heavens; the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao below, acting on Yang Kai's orders, struck its chest with both fists, and with the drumbeat of war its body suddenly swelled, transforming straight into a Stone Giant.

In the next moment blazing fire flared from its exterior and a terrifying heat erupted, causing the stone of its surface to melt away.

It looked as if it were clad in a layer of Lava armor.

Xiaoxiao's final transformed form: a Lava Giant!

Merely that giant, over ten zhang tall and its whole body suffused with lava, already exuded an unimaginable oppression; moreover, it hoisted on its shoulder a thick Heaven-Shaking Pillar that weighed hundreds of thousands of jin, which in Xiaoxiao's hand felt feather-light — with a single sweep, houses within a hundred zhang around it were pulverized into dust.

The gale of savage power struck each Void King Realm expert's chest like a great hammer, leaving them with visibly wary expressions.

Boom...

The Incarnation crashed to the ground.

The Incarnation, as towering as a mountain, fell like a meteor; the enormous shock rocked the whole of Purple Star City three times over — even houses in the outer city developed many fissures, inner-city buildings nearer the impact collapsed outright, and those slightly farther off were swaying precariously.

Yang Kai stood in midair with a calm, unconcerned look, casually whistling. A wanton smile played on his face as he fixed his gaze on the ashen-faced Kuang Shizong.

The Incarnation slowly lifted a great foot and stepped forward.

Its movement was agonizingly slow, as if some curse bound it; yet when that foot came down a gigantic footprint appeared somewhere in Purple Star City, and everything beneath the print was gone, leaving only a deep pit.

The Incarnation made no other offensive movement; it simply walked forward, step by step.

And yet the destruction it brought was beyond imagination!

"What the hell is that thing?"

"Quick. Attack it! If we don't stop it, the whole Purple Star City will be finished!"

Many experts shouted; without waiting for Kuang Shizong's command they each unleashed techniques and attacked the Incarnation.

A full ten Void King Realm experts joined the fray, among them two at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. Each did not hesitate to unleash their secret arts and display their Secret Treasures, converging into a powerful killing force aimed at the Incarnation in an effort to halt its advance.

A series of detonations rang out; earth and stone flew, brilliant light burst forth, forcing people to squint.

When the light faded and they looked again, everyone's hearts chilled.

The combined might of ten Void King Realm experts had not been able to destroy that behemoth at first strike; though many stones were blasted away and its surface pitted and scarred, those losses did not affect the Incarnation's movement — instead they only roused its ferocity.

Controlling the Incarnation's actions was a wisp of Yang Kai's divided soul, inheriting Yang Kai's personality, thought, and methods — how could it tolerate being attacked without retaliating?

A terrifying ferocity flashed in the Incarnation's eyes; its vast body sank slightly, it raised a foot and stomped fiercely.

Crack, crack...

The ground split into huge chasms, jagged and interlocking, spreading outward at lightning speed.

The Incarnation raised both hands, and from the fractured earth countless chunks of soil of every size were heaved up by an invisible force — some only as big as heads, others comparable to whole houses.

Its body trembled and it roared; all those controlled earth-blocks shot out like a locust swarm in every direction.

Such an assault might not injure Void King Realm experts — even Origin Returning Realm cultivators could easily evade it — but as stones flew, palace halls were pierced and house after house was blown apart.

In merely five breaths' time, centered on where the Incarnation stood, half of the Purple Star Palace lay in ruins!

Kuang Shizong's face grew ashen to the extreme.

At his own stronghold the enemy acted with such brazenness, and all of Purple Star's top forces could not stop them — if this spread, this would become the laughingstock of the Star Domain and the greatest stain in Purple Star's history.

He wished to capture the ringleader, but Yang Kai's attention remained fixed on him, leaving him no opening.

A bird-cry sounded; the Fire Bird that had been calmly circling above Yang Kai suddenly flew out without waiting for an order.

Yang Kai frowned, unsure what this fellow intended to do. His gaze swept across the field and, upon noticing a certain object, he immediately understood. He didn’t try to stop the Fire Bird’s actions.

The Fire Bird moved with great speed; with a beat of its wings it leapt a distance of a hundred zhang.

It flew straight to stand before Li Maoming; opening its beak it spat a mouthful of flame laced with lightning like a Jiao bursting into the sea.

Sensing the terrifying power within the flame, Li Maoming did not dare neglect it and hurriedly dodged; at the same time he slapped his gourd, from which surged a great volume of Blue Flame that formed a river in the sky sweeping toward the Fire Bird.

The Fire Bird's eyes took on an almost human guile; instead of retreating it advanced, clamped the Blue Flame in its beak, and its belly swelled with a gurgling sound — then an astonishing thing happened.

It actually drew that Blue Flame down into its stomach.

With its trick successful, the Fire Bird turned and flew back toward Yang Kai without looking back.

Li Maoming stood there with his mouth agape, dumbstruck and unable to collect himself for a long time.

After a while he slapped his thigh and cried out, "Ah — my Kunlan Blue Ice Flame!"

As he spoke he continuously formed hand seals, stirring his Divine Sense and Saint Yuan together to try to seize back the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame he had refined and draw it from the Fire Bird; visibly the Fire Bird's belly bulged and heaved, as if something inside were rampaging.

Its surface flashed with red, purple, and blue light.

The Fire Bird cried out in pain.

It would not be so easy to forcibly take another's Kunlan Blue Ice Flame — there had to be a price; after all the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame was no common thing, but a wondrous treasure Li Maoming had obtained at the cost of near-death.

Of the three colors on the Fire Bird, red represented its native fire power, purple was the power of the previously devoured Qiantian Thunderfire, and blue, naturally, was the power of the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame.

The three colors shone and vied with one another; across the Fire Bird's body it looked like an irreconcilable struggle.

But the Fire Bird was still the Fire Bird — having absorbed Sun’s True Fire and Qiantian Thunderfire, either flame was no weaker than the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame; after only a brief stalemate the blue light dimmed.

At that moment the Fire Bird's body trembled and an illusory portrait of a treasure cauldron manifested inside its belly.

It was none other than its life-bound Secret Treasure — that Void King-Grade refining furnace!

In that instant the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame was thoroughly sealed within the Refining Furnace; given enough time the Fire Bird could refine that strange fire, and when refined it would surely increase in strength.

"Pft..." from afar Li Maoming spat a mouthful of blood, feeling the link between his Secret Treasure and his mind severed; he understood the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame could no longer be recovered unless he killed the Fire Bird.

While the Fire Bird and Li Maoming struggled over the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame, the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao was locked in fierce combat with Gongsun Liang.

Though Xiaoxiao had become a Lava Giant, compared to the Incarnation it was still like a grandson standing before his grandfather — only by craning one's neck could one glimpse its nape; seeing that the Incarnation could not be stopped, Gongsun Liang turned his attention to Xiaoxiao.

He did not dare use that short sword Secret Treasure whose spirit had been greatly diminished; instead he produced a heavy, hammer-shaped Secret Treasure.

He poured all his might into it and slammed it down at Xiaoxiao.

Xiaoxiao met it with a single staff stroke.

The hammer-shaped Secret Treasure exploded into powder on the spot; Gongsun Liang was flung backward, his arm bones shattered.

Only now did Gongsun Liang realize what a grave mistake he had made. His hammer-shaped Secret Treasure, though not Void King-Grade, was still an Origin-Grade Upper-Level artifact—extremely sturdy. Yet it had been shattered into dust with ease. That alone made clear just how terrifying the power contained in that seemingly casual swing truly was.

That force alone was enough to make one man's strength beat ten.

Both Second-Stage Void King Realm practitioners were utterly humbled; the remaining eight First-Stage Void King Realm elders exchanged glances, for a time uncertain what to do.

The Incarnation still walked at an unhurried pace; with every step the earth split and it left massive footprints, its presence pressed on everyone like a ten-thousand zhang-high mountain and made it hard to draw breath.

Even those sheltered behind Yang Kai, like Shen Tu, gaped with mouths agape, staring at everything as though their minds were utterly blank, incapable of thought.

With only his own power he resisted all of Purple Star's experts — including eight First-Stage Void King Realm, two Second-Stage Void King Realm, and one Third-Stage Void King Realm — without falling behind in the slightest; on the contrary, he seized the advantage everywhere.

If one had not seen it with one's own eyes, one would never believe it.

Shen Tu, shaken, felt a subtle bitterness well up in his heart.

He recalled the first time he met Yang Kai: Yang Kai had been impressive, but in terms of cultivation he lagged far behind; they had helped and looked out for one another just to survive.

But now, meeting again, Shen Tu found Yang Kai had risen to a height he could not even look up to — the chasm between them was so vast he could never bridge it in his lifetime.

That realization left Shen Tu feeling despondent...

Over the years he had not wasted his time, training hard to win Chairman Ai Ou's recognition and to surpass his naturally gifted Third Brother, but his achievements meant nothing in the face of Yang Kai.
