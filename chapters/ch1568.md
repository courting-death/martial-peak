## Chapter 1568 — Dare Not Kneel?

Thinking this, the yao warrior's wrist twitched and the long whip he had been swinging at Yang Kai veered off, striking only empty air with a crisp snap.

Unable to gauge Yang Kai's depth, he dared not act rashly, yet on the other side Young Master Mi Tian's face had to be defended; after all, so many yao experts had already paid him respect, and it seemed outrageous for a mere human to be standing there.

This was contempt toward Mi Tian, an insult to the yao as a whole.

For a moment the yao warrior was at a loss, not knowing what to do, and he cast a pleading look toward Mi Tian.

"How bold a human you are, to see me and still dare not kneel?" Mi Tian smiled lightly, appearing harmless, but anyone could hear the contempt in his voice.

Mi Tian's noble status and overwhelming power gave him the standing to say such things.

This human is done for! Many warriors thought, looking at Yang Kai with expressions full of pity.

But more showed schadenfreude: with Yang Kai drawing Mi Tian's attention, that notorious Evil-Eyed Young Master would likely have no spare energy to pay attention to Huiyue City's pretty women.

Thinking that, many quietly felt grateful to Yang Kai and furtively pressed the heads of the attractive women beside them down, keeping their faces from being fully seen.

"Kneel?" Yang Kai chuckled, meeting Mi Tian's gaze without fear. "Why should I?"

A yao shamelessly demanding that he kneel? Yang Kai was amused by the arrogance.

To be honest, he did not wish to stir up trouble on Di Chen Star. If Mi Tian had pretended not to see him, the matter would have passed. No one would have said anything. But now the conflict seemed inevitable, and Yang Kai naturally stepped forward to meet it.

"Simply because you are a human!" Mi Tian sneered, his presence undiminished. "When humans see me, they must kneel!"

Sensing his anger, the two Thunderflame Flying Lizards pulling the carriage grew agitated, turning their heads and fixing their gaze on where Yang Kai stood, snorting hot breath from their nostrils, their beastly eyes shining with bloodthirsty cruelty.

The faces of those beside Yang Kai changed drastically; without hesitation they scattered, no longer daring to remain with him, fearing being caught in the crossfire.

In an instant, with Yang Kai at the center, within a radius of over ten zhang, he was left alone.

Yang Kai became even more conspicuous.

"Human, on Di Chen Star, you had better not be so presumptuous. Otherwise, you'll pay a heavy price!" Mi Tian watched Yang Kai indifferently, and the two stunning women at his side glared at Yang Kai with wide almond-shaped eyes, as if he were extremely rude.

"Di Chen Star is the yao's territory. You, a human… hm. Best to tuck your tail and behave. I am not an uncaring man. Considering this is your first offense, I can overlook it—kneel, and I will spare your life!" Mi Tian extended a finger and pointed downward, his expression full of arrogant command.

"What if I don't?" Yang Kai's eyes flashed cold light, yet he smiled faintly at Mi Tian.

"You won't have that choice!" Mi Tian snorted coldly.

As the words fell, the Thunderflame Flying Lizard on the left suddenly opened its mouth, and a ball of fiery light crackling with electric arcs formed and hurtled toward Yang Kai with terrifying momentum.

Feeling the oppressive heat and the terrifying killing power within the fireball, many warriors showed looks of alarm.

Most had long heard of the Thunderflame Flying Lizard's fearsome nature but had never seen it with their own eyes; today they finally witnessed it.

No wonder it was said that a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioner would flee from a Thunderflame Flying Lizard; this single fireball alone was not something an ordinary Origin Returning Realm could withstand.

The terrifying fireball bore down, yet Yang Kai stood as if unaware of the danger; only when the fireball drew near did he suddenly spread his hand and snatch at it.

"Courting death!" many warriors watching the scene thought.

The Thunderflame Flying Lizard's attack was not so easily neutralized; that kid looked insane to try to take it with his body—no wonder he dared to provoke Mi Tian.

A scene that shocked them unfolded.

When Yang Kai's large hand seized the fireball, he did not, as everyone expected, burn to ashes; instead the fireball made a soft hissing sound in his hand.

A wave of incomparably mysterious power rippled outward and vanished in an instant. The terrifying ball of fire suddenly deflated like a punctured bladder, shrinking rapidly until it disappeared completely.

Yang Kai was unscathed.

A chorus of gasps rose up.

Mi Tian finally sat up slowly, brushing aside the woman half-reclining on his lap, his eyes conveying a look of serious appraisal.

"Good, Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!" Mi Tian grinned, showing a mouthful of white teeth. "No wonder he dared be so arrogant—turns out he has some ability!"

At the instant Yang Kai struck, he had already discerned Yang Kai's cultivation level.

The Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm was no small matter on Di Chen Star, and moreover, he was a human!

On Di Chen, the yao dominated; though resources were plentiful and the world's Spiritual Qi rich, hardly any humans could rise to the Origin Returning Realm—those with such aptitude had long been crushed in the cradle.

The yao would never let humans grow powerful; they allowed humans to survive in the cracks only because they valued certain unique human talents—there was no way they'd permit humans to usurp them.

Thus, upon realizing Yang Kai was a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioner, Mi Tian's interest was instantly piqued; standing on the beast-cart, he waved his hand and snorted coldly, "Kill him!"

The two Ninth-Tier demonic beasts immediately went berserk, rearing up and gaping their huge mouths as flames and lightning danced faintly within.

A commotion broke out at the city gate, and most warriors hurriedly scattered and fled.

Yang Kai laughed loudly: "Two beasts and they dare act so brazen!"

The blades under Yang Kai’s control shot forth like arrows loosed from a bow, streaking toward the Thunderflame Flying Lizards.

Two pillars of fire spewed simultaneously from the mouths of the Thunderflame Flying Lizards, meeting the Golden Blood Threads head-on—yet they still failed to halt their advance. The Blazing Flames that would make anyone pale in fear didn’t inflict the slightest harm upon the Golden Blood Threads.

In the blink of an eye, the Golden Blood Threads shot into a Thunderflame Flying Lizard's mouth.

In the next instant, the two Ninth-Tier Demonic Beasts let out roars that sounded almost like wails of agony. Their massive bodies staggered and swayed, crashing into the nearby buildings and smashing them to pieces.

The Golden Blood Threads that had pierced their bellies were now cutting wildly inside them under Yang Kai's control, inflicting unimaginable damage.

Yang Kai did not idle either; in a flash he darted out, quickly reaching the lizard's head, and landed a punch on the back of its skull.

It seemed like a light, airy punch, giving no hint of the force contained within.

But when that fist struck the Thunderflame Flying Lizard's head, everyone clearly saw the massive beast stagger as if hit by a ten-thousand-pound hammer; it first reared back then fell like a meteor, crashing to the ground.

The earth shook and mountains trembled!

A huge pit immediately formed in the ground, the lizard's entire head sunk into it.

Worthy indeed of being a Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast—though the Golden Blood Threads were wreaking havoc inside its body, and Yang Kai had struck it hard on the back of the head, it still did not die. Instead, its ferocity was aroused even further. With a thunderous roar, its massive flesh wings beat furiously, trying to throw Yang Kai off its back.

Yang Kai twisted his body, instantly appearing before the Thunderflame Flying Lizard. Planting both feet firmly against its lower jaw, he raised his arms in a motion as if supporting the heavens, forcefully holding up the creature’s upper jaw that was about to bite down.

"What is he trying to do?" The onlookers were stunned, staring at Yang Kai in shock.

The stance he struck made it seem as though he meant to tear the Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast apart with his bare hands. Yet the sight of a single human’s small frame straining against the gaping maw of the Thunderflame Flying Lizard formed a striking, almost unreal contrast.

It seemed the lizard could swallow the human whole with a single bite.

Yang Kai's body curled into a shrimp-like shape, the exposed muscles bulging as if storing unimaginable power.

He and the Thunderflame Flying Lizard were engaged in a clash and contest of strength.

Everyone thought Yang Kai was mad.

As everyone knew, the yao possessed unimaginable natural advantages in strength, not to mention a massive Ninth-Tier beast like the Thunderflame Flying Lizard, whose bite force was particularly terrifying.

Yang Kai's deliberate move up to the beast's mouth was essentially a challenge to the lizard's toughest, most resilient body part.

Is this guy out of his mind? Many people couldn’t help but have that thought flash through their hearts.

But the result made their eyes pop; it arrived so swiftly.

At the very moment they suspected Yang Kai of being mentally unsound, his shrimp-curled body suddenly straightened.

As if wielding a power fierce enough to pierce through the entire Star Domain, the Thunderflame Flying Lizard’s gaping maw could do nothing to restrain the extension of Yang Kai’s body.

That enormous mouth stretched into an impossibly exaggerated arc—the upper jaw was flung upward while the lower jaw dropped sharply downward.

Tear...

Blood sprayed everywhere as the Thunderflame Flying Lizard's head split apart, the muscles and tendons ripped by the tremendous force, laid bare before everyone's eyes.

The entire crowd was dumbstruck, staring at Yang Kai with oddly bewildered expressions, as if their minds could not process it.

If someone said Yang Kai was a yao expert famed for strength, the scene might make sense—but... he's only a human!

Could a human possess such terrifying strength?

With a thunderous boom, the massive lizard's body collapsed to the ground, kicking up a cloud of dust.

Yang Kai stood half in the air, soaked in blood and murderous intent, like a god of slaughter from ancient times, sending chills down spines.

He turned his head toward the other Thunderflame Flying Lizard charging at him and grinned ferociously.

Although the lizard had not transformed into a person, it had some intelligence; seeing its companion killed by that human in an inconceivable way, how could it dare approach?

It let out a low growl, flapped its wings fiercely, attempting to halt its advance.
