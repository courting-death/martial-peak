## Chapter 386 — Hidden Meanings

In that moment when the middle-aged man was lost in thought, Yang Kai made his move.

With two beast roars, the White Tiger and Divine Ox rushed forth.

A crimson long sword was gripped in hand, slashing forward with a sword energy that spanned over a dozen zhang, shooting straight at the middle-aged man. Suddenly, countless petals flew out from within, swirling and sharp as blades, hurtling towards him.

The purple ghostly light surged again, and the soul technique was displayed in all its glory!

In that instant, Yang Kai utilized all conventional means available to him.

Sensing the terrifying power approaching, the middle-aged man let out a strange cry, finally daring not to show any carelessness. He awkwardly avoided that sword energy but was entangled by the White Tiger and Divine Ox. Before he could disperse the two beast souls, he was completely enveloped by the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia, which came with the fragrance of flowers.

With a loud boom...

The middle-aged man madly urged his True Essence, creating a visible shock wave that spread outward from him, a fierce wind rising, containing his power, blocking the attacks of the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia and the two beast souls.

His body leaped into the air, twisting in mid-air; unexpectedly, he did not retreat but advanced, pouncing towards Yang Kai.

After all, he was a Third Stage martial artist of the Divine Roaming Realm. Although he had temporarily been affected by Yang Kai's words and had lost the initiative, his instinctual combat experience still led him to choose the most suitable way to fight.

This young man was undoubtedly very strong, possessing combat power far beyond his own True Essence Realm's Seventh Stage level. Yet the middle-aged man sharply sensed that the soul technique Yang Kai was employing seemed somewhat ethereal and insubstantial, not as refined as the techniques of an ordinary Divine Roaming Realm practitioner.

To be precise, it was like a tree without roots, or water without source.

Though powerful, it wasn’t as terrifying as it seemed.

The reason was simply that Yang Kai currently only had Divine Sense; although he could utilize soul techniques, he lacked a Sea of Consciousness.

Once his Sea of Consciousness was established, the power of his soul techniques would truly unleash its full potential.

Although the middle-aged man did not know the reason behind this, he made the correct choice.

As long as he could withstand Yang Kai's soul attack, he was still merely a True Essence Realm martial artist at the end of the day. Even with a high-grade treasure in hand, and possessing extraordinary martial skills, the realm disparity still placed him at several levels below.

He might not be able to kill him!

In a daze, the middle-aged man stabilized his footing, forming seals with his hands. A series of thunderclaps rang out, seeming to suggest that his True Essence could summon the miraculous power of heaven and thunder.

Crack, crack, crack...

Bolts of lightning thicker than a man's thigh descended from the heavens, electric snakes slithering in the air and wrapping around Yang Kai layer upon layer.

He was the strongest among the four pursuing Yang Kai, and as he made his move, his momentum was exceptional.

Yang Kai could not avoid it, and was instantly entangled by those roaming electric strikes, making each step a struggle, his body feeling numb.

With a cold expression, the True Yang Primordial Qi erupted from within him, forming a seemingly thin defensive shield around his body, blocking the encroaching arcs of electricity.

With a flick of the Shura Sword, waves of sword energy sliced toward the middle-aged man, causing the previously dispersed Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia to once again gather, striking fiercely at him.

The middle-aged man did not dare hold back, quickly bringing out a small hammer, which sparkled with arcs of electricity. Upon grasping the hammer, he found his own power enhanced by the lightning.

The two beast souls charged forth but were repeatedly obstructed by the bolts he released, unable to advance or retreat.

One was in mid-air, the other on the ground, less than ten zhang apart. Both unleashed their techniques, creating a situation that was surprisingly evenly matched.

Frowning deeply, the middle-aged man sensed something amiss.

This assassination attempt on the young master of the Yang Family had carried a great risk. According to their plan, they would strike successfully and retreat immediately. Even if the young master had two Blood Servants by his side, they were not afraid.

But unexpectedly, this young master was so formidable, having killed three opponents of higher realms than himself, and could engage in a fierce battle with a Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert.

The two treasures he had employed were extraordinary, all high-grade heavenly items.

His martial skills were exquisite, his True Essence pure, and he also utilized soul techniques!

The middle-aged man quickly calculated that it would take him at least half an hour to kill him! This was under the most ideal conditions, with no one interfering.

Now, time was tight, and the opponent wouldn’t give him half an hour! Moreover, the middle-aged man had no idea whether this young master had some hidden trump card remaining.

This time, it seemed he was doomed! Anxiety gripped the middle-aged man's heart.

Just then, an echoing roar suddenly erupted from another part of the battlefield.

On that battlefield, the fog enveloping the three Divine Roaming Realm experts quickly dispersed with that howl. Tu Feng, resplendent in red light, revealed his form, his face twisted in a terrifying grimace, the scar on his face seemingly alive.

Blood Fury Technique!

“Yuxian, leave this to me!” Tu Feng said calmly, his cold gaze making the three Divine Roaming Realm experts feel their scalps tighten.

Tang Yuxian said nothing, leaping out of the fray and rapidly flying toward Yang Kai.

Seeing Tang Yuxian's approach, the middle-aged man who was fiercely battling Yang Kai dared not linger.

He was merely a Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm practitioner, and in this plan, he was only responsible for killing the young master of the Yang Family. He was not qualified to engage with Blood Servants.

In a panic, he unleashed all his skills, briefly obstructing Yang Kai before turning tail and fleeing, not looking back.

Just as he departed, Tang Yuxian had already arrived at Yang Kai's side, anxiously asking, “Young master, are you injured?”

Yang Kai waved his hand, and a thousand petals lined up into a dragon shape, chasing after the fleeing figure but unable to catch up. He hurriedly called out, “Bring him back!”

Tang Yuxian froze but did not hesitate for a moment, her delicate figure swaying as she vanished from sight.

In just a brief moment, Tang Yuxian returned, carrying the fleeing middle-aged man.

A Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm martial artist, in the presence of Tang Yuxian, had no qualification even to hold her shoes.

His True Essence had been imprisoned; not even sparing a glance at him, Tang Yuxian tossed him down before Yang Kai.

The middle-aged man appeared defeated, fearfully glancing at Tang Yuxian, seemingly realizing the terror of the Blood Servants only at that moment.

With a bitter smile, he turned his gaze to Yang Kai, stating resolutely, “Young master Yang... you won't be able to extract anything from me.”

Yang Kai smiled, unhurriedly approaching him. When he stood before him, he looked down from a height and said quietly, “When have I said I wanted to ask you anything?”

As his words fell, the blood-red long sword carved a beautiful arc, and the middle-aged man’s face showed bewilderment as his head rolled to the ground.

“Those who know my secrets either die or become my people!” Yang Kai snorted lightly.

Tang Yuxian suddenly trembled, looking at Yang Kai with some fear, her expression thoughtful.

Yang Kai's words seemed to imply something deeper!

What secret did this middle-aged man know about the young master that led to such a decisive murder to silence him?

What about herself? Had she inadvertently grasped some of the young master’s secrets as well?

Lost in thought, Yang Kai had already sheathed the long sword, calmly stating, “Go help Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman.”

“Oh!” Tang Yuxian nodded blankly, not daring to delay, and once again shot out.

Yang Kai stood still, gazing for a moment, discovering that although Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman were not the opponents of the enemies, they remained unharmed. The opponents clearly had no intention of harming them; they were simply leaving two people there to block their path.

As Tang Yuxian approached, those two seemed not to have realized the seriousness of the situation. They had no time to react before being slaughtered.

Meanwhile, Tu Feng and the three Divine Roaming Realm experts had already vanished without a trace, possibly realizing the futility of the situation and not wanting to engage with the Blood Servants wielding the Blood Fury Technique, having fled far away.

Tu Feng was hot on their heels.

Moments later, Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman arrived to join Yang Kai, led by Tang Yuxian.

Both women appeared somewhat anxious and worried, and a hint of fear lingered in their expressions.

Looking at Yang Kai with suspicion, Qiu Yimeng asked, “Why are you completely uninjured? Didn’t I see you being struck down from the sky?”

Hearing this, Tang Yuxian immediately became worried, looking Yang Kai up and down, her beautiful eyes filled with concern.

When Yang Kai was in danger earlier, she had been busy entangling those three experts, leaving her no time to pay attention to his situation.

Qiu Yimeng, however, had known beforehand that she would not be in any life-threatening danger, hence her concern for Yang Kai was naturally greater.

“Young master, are you really unhurt?” Tang Yuxian asked hesitantly, seemingly afraid he might deceive her.

“A small injury, nothing to worry about.” Yang Kai casually replied, though in truth, he had not suffered even a scratch. However, given the perilous situation he had faced, claiming he was completely unscathed would only deepen their suspicions.

“You...” Qiu Yimeng slowly shook her head, her expression heavy. “I’m increasingly unable to see through you.”

Glimpsing at the three corpses on the ground, Tang Yuxian was equally astonished.

Though the men were dead, she could still sense that these three had significantly higher realm cultivation than Yang Kai, with one even being a Divine Roaming Realm practitioner.

Yet Yang Kai had killed all three without any external assistance!

Moreover, he had managed to tangle with a Third Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert for a long time!

“Enough about me, how are you, Yuxian?” Yang Kai clearly did not want to prolong this topic and turned his gaze to Tang Yuxian.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman suddenly realized that Tang Yuxian seemed to be injured.

Her clothing was somewhat tattered, there was fresh blood still at the corner of her mouth, her True Essence was surging restlessly, evidently suffering some internal injuries, and a long wound stained her snowy arm, the bleeding having stopped, yet her clothes were soaked in red.

With her strength, she should not have ended up this badly had she not faced three enemies alone.

The main issue was the time constraint; she had to make some sacrifices to allow Tu Feng to unleash the Blood Fury Technique so she could rush to rescue Yang Kai.

Had they been given enough time, she and Tu Feng would have been able to defeat those three experts unscathed, or even kill them.

But concerning Yang Kai’s safety, both she and Tu Feng had had no time to waste, so even if she knew facing three opponents was a terrible idea, Tang Yuxian still acted without hesitation.

Even knowing that unleashing the Blood Fury Technique would drain his vitality, Tu Feng acted without hesitation.

The loyalty of the Blood Servants had been vividly demonstrated in this battle.

“I’m fine; young master, you don’t need to worry!” Tang Yuxian said, a look of gratitude washing over her face, slowly shaking her head.
