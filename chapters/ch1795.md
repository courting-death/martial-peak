## Chapter 1795 — Secured It, Flee for Your Life

At the horizon, a band of seven-colored light rapidly closed in; amid the glowing radiance, a hulking shape could be vaguely made out.

"Not good!" the Ghost Ancestor shouted, abandoning any mockery of Xu Wei and Kong Fa, and with a single all-out move he struck both Void King Realm men back and bellowed at Yang Kai, "The Divine Bird is returning—Yang Kai, hurry!"

No reminder was needed; the instant he heard that clarion cry Yang Kai already understood what was happening.

His face grew extremely grave.

The Divine Bird somehow sensed the change in the Everlasting Tree; it had been disturbed the moment they made even slight progress. At its speed it would be back here in no time, and when it arrived everyone present would have to clear out.

He sat cross-legged where he was, commanding his Incarnation with all his strength while simultaneously issuing orders to Xiaoxiao.

"Roar!" Sensing Yang Kai's urgency, Xiaoxiao's body dropped, it let out a fearsome bellow, audible shockwaves spewed from its mouth, and in the next moment the little creature abruptly swelled, growing larger!

In the blink of an eye Xiaoxiao's size surged three to four times.

Though not at its limit and still short of a Stone Giant, the added strength it gained was by no means negligible.

The Everlasting Tree was instantly uprooted at a remarkably rapid pace…

Yang Kai stole a hurried glance toward where the Divine Bird had been and his expression changed.

The seven-colored light was already almost upon them, less than a hundred li away from his position—hundred li sounded far, but at the Divine Bird's speed it might only take a couple of wing beats to arrive.

At that moment not only was he panic-stricken, everyone appeared flustered and at loose ends.

Ni Guang and Zi Long had stopped what they were doing and shot back; the former wrapped Xue Yue in Saint Yuan and dashed away like a bolt of lightning. Before leaving, Xue Yue shouted Yang Kai's name loudly, urging him to flee—

And Zi Long dragged Zi Donglai with him, not daring to linger for an instant, hastily retreating.

"Brother Kong, let's go!" Xu Wei's scalp tingled; shouting as he cast a hand seal, he expelled a mouthful of filthy breath and transformed into a streak of rainbow light, moving faster than anyone else.

Kong Fa followed close behind.

Many Void King Realm experts fled like dogs with their tails between their legs—utterly comic to behold.

In an instant everyone around the Everlasting Tree had entirely evacuated, leaving only the Ghost Ancestor guarding Yang Kai.

Even the mighty Ghost Ancestor had sweat beading on his brow; the black mass of qi wrapped around him surged and struggled uneasily.

"Grand Elder, you go first!" Yang Kai cried urgently.

"I'll go with you." In a critical moment the Ghost Ancestor proved reliable; he did not abandon Yang Kai to save himself, which made Yang Kai think bringing him into the Lingxiao Sect had indeed been a sound decision.

It must be known that Ghost Ancestor, by choosing to stay behind at such a time, was risking his very life.

In times like this a man's true character was revealed, and the Ghost Ancestor had undoubtedly won Yang Kai's approval in his heart.

"I can make it out. Don't worry about me," Yang Kai said quickly.

The Ghost Ancestor paused then understood; Yang Kai was likely relying on his spatial power. He solemnly warned, "Then you must be careful, I'll leave ahead."

As he spoke, his body flickered and the Ten Thousand Souls Banner wrapped him up, turning him into a cloud of black qi that fled into the distance.

By the time the words left his mouth the Divine Bird was already very near—perhaps a breath away—and at such close range Yang Kai could finally make out what the Divine Bird actually looked like.

It was an immense peacock, its plumage riotous with color, its tail feathers long and exquisitely beautiful.

Apart from the legendary phoenix, there was probably nothing in the world more beautiful than the Divine Bird before his eyes.

Yet beneath that beauty lurked an overwhelming murderous intent!

Another piercing cry rang out. Over where the divine bird was, the Seven Luminaries Divine Light erupted wildly, pouring down like a torrent of stars collapsing from the heavens.

Yang Kai leaped up from where he stood and charged forward.

At the same time the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao and the Incarnation had already secured the Everlasting Tree.

The instant the Everlasting Tree was pulled from the ground the whole Medicine Valley churned; Xiaoxiao grabbed its fellow Incarnation with one hand, the other seized the uprooted Everlasting Tree, planted both feet and shoved off the earth, charging toward Yang Kai.

The two parties met halfway.

Yang Kai shoved the two Stone Puppets into his Spatial Ring, then thrust his hands out, surging with dense Spatial Force; he plunged into the void and split to either side!

A spatial rift immediately opened.

He dove straight in!

The incoming Seven Luminaries Divine Light enveloped the spot he had just been standing at but was barred by the rift, while Yang Kai had vanished.

The Divine Bird seemed to sense something; its massive body dipped and lunged toward the torn rift.

Inside the void rift Yang Kai slowly exhaled, his face still pale with lingering fear.

If he had been any slower a moment ago he likely would have fallen prey to the Divine Bird—fortunately Xiaoxiao had lived up to expectations and successfully pulled the Everlasting Tree free.

Thinking of the Everlasting Tree, Yang Kai's heart burned hot again.

Such a treasure had fallen into his hands?

He had never imagined this trip into the Lost Realm would yield such earth-shattering gains. His original intention had only been to seek a Jingkong Beast and obtain its Inner Core, but what happened afterward had all been beyond his expectations.

Whether the many heaven-and-earth treasures gathered in the Medicine Valley or this Everlasting Tree, everything far exceeded his expectations.

Yang Kai's blood was boiling with excitement…

At that moment a strange fluctuation of power came from not far behind him.

He frowned and turned to look; upon seeing what lay before him his face changed in horror and his eyes widened.

From the rift he had torn to escape a huge claw reached in—and judging by the shape of the claw it was undoubtedly that of the Seven Luminaries Peacock.

It could pierce the seal of spatial power and accurately seek out the space he occupied? Yang Kai's face darkened.

Immediately a second claw reached through the rift; the talons were sharp, glinting like swords.

Looking out, it was as if those two claws had seized a gate, and something terrifying was trying to emerge through that portal, sending a chill down the spine.

The next moment the two claws split apart, and the rift Yang Kai had torn widened.

Through the tear Yang Kai could vaguely make out a portion of the other side, though the view was unclear.

The Divine Bird's head poked through the rift, its two crimson eyes immediately fixed on Yang Kai suspended in the void.

In that gaze there was a hatred carved into bone and marrow.

The Divine Bird opened its beak and gave an enraged screech; dazzling seven-colored light quickly formed in its throat.

"Damn!" Yang Kai was frightened out of his wits and could not remain where he was. The Seven Luminaries Divine Light was something even Ni Guang and Zi Long would not dare to touch; although he believed his strength was considerable, he could not compare himself to those two and naturally needed to flee.

No sooner had he left the spot than a pillar of Seven Luminaries Divine Light shot from the bird's mouth at incredible speed, piercing deep into the void.

Wherever it passed the void trembled incessantly.

"Huh?" Yang Kai frowned; though he had avoided the beam and suffered no injury, he keenly sensed that under the assault the spatial rift had become unstable, as if it might collapse at any moment.

The discovery made cold sweat break out all over him.

He had never expected the Divine Bird to possess such earth-shattering means.

Another seven-colored beam was expelled; although Yang Kai had already put distance between himself and the Divine Bird and the bird had no intention of diving fully into the rift, when the second beam poured into the tear the space there became even more unstable.

"This creature… could it be trying to destroy the rift and force me out?" Yang Kai considered the possibility and his mood turned foul.

If that were the case then the situation would be utterly dire.

He had thought that with the Everlasting Tree in hand hiding in the rift would be safe; he never expected that with that creature's methods one could still be terrorized even inside a rift.

A third beam poured in…

A fourth…

The Divine Bird, seemingly tireless, kept spewing beams into the void, and with each addition the rift grew ever more unstable.

Finally, when it had spat nine beams, a black hole suddenly opened in a certain spot of the void struck by the light.

The scene looked as if the rift had been punched through by the Divine Bird's light.

At this point the entire rift began to collapse; spatial force turned chaotic and the shreds of void rushed to contract rapidly toward a central point.

It was clear that once the rift fully contracted the space would cease to exist and Yang Kai would be mercilessly crushed into pulp by the compressive force.

Yang Kai cursed and without thinking flew straight for the hole the Divine Bird had punched.

To escape the rift now he could either return the way he had come or try to find another weak spot back into the Lost Realm, though returning to the Lost Realm was hardly safe—if the Divine Bird scented him there he would still be hunted down.

He could only pin his hopes on that newly appearing hole, praying it connected to a safe place.

With spatial power at his back he wasn't worried about losing his way in the void, so wherever that hole led was better than going back to the Lost Realm.

He made a snap decision with no hesitation.

After ten or so breaths he arrived before the hole and dove through it.

Only after his figure disappeared did the Divine Bird coldly watch the direction he had gone and retract its head and claws.
