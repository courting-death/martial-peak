## Chapter 1845 — Purple Star’s Command Token

In the Commerce Guild's backyard, Chairwoman Hua Youmeng, Gao Hong and the others were stunned; compared with Commander Lu Tianfeng's servile groveling, they were far more concerned with what sort of identity Yang Kai might possess, and why the Commander of Purple Star City, after entering to see him for only a short while, had altered his attitude so drastically.

They didn’t hear a single word of Lu Tianfeng’s flattery that followed — their minds were buzzing, blank with shock.

"There was a misunderstanding just now," Commander Lu Tianfeng said solemnly. "My foolish subordinates seem to have heard rumors from somewhere and mistakenly thought there were troublemakers here; they arrested people without distinguishing the facts and caused varying degrees of loss and damage to your Commerce Guild's people and property. Chairwoman, rest assured — since I am a Commander, I will not tolerate slack. I will deal with this matter sternly and give Chairwoman a satisfactory explanation."

"Hmm..." Chairwoman Hua Youmeng forced a smile. "This matter is not entirely the fault of Deputy Commander Bai Zhengchu and the others; we bear some responsibility as well."

Hearing her say that, Bai Zhengchu immediately had tears welling in his eyes; he stared at Chairwoman Hua Youmeng with an expression of gratitude as if ready to die for her.

"Is that so?" Commander Lu Tianfeng raised an eyebrow, then cast a cautious glance toward the side room and, unhurriedly, said, "Since Chairwoman is so understanding..."

"Humph!" a cold snort came from within the side room.

Commander Lu Tianfeng's expression turned stern and he snapped, "Even if Chairwoman is so understanding, they made mistakes and must be punished. As members of Purple Star City's guards, if you cannot hold yourselves to the law, what are you doing as guards? If at the slightest provocation you rush in to smash and wound people, will the myriad Commerce Guilds of Purple Star City still be able to do business? Deputy Commander Bai Zhengchu, what do you say?"

Bai Zhengchu now fully realized he had kicked an iron plate this time. Wearing a mournful expression, he stepped forward, bowed, and said, “This subordinate has been incompetent in handling the matter. I ask Commander to punish me as you see fit, and President Hua to be magnanimous and not hold this one’s foolishness against him.”

Chairwoman Hua Youmeng hurriedly stepped aside and said she dared not refuse.

Commander Lu Tianfeng declared righteously, "You were blind and short-sighted, offending Chairwoman and the Commerce Guild. I will punish you by sending you to the Cold Prison to face the wall for one month — do you accept?"

"The Cold Prison!" Bai Zhengchu's body trembled and his face went white.

He had just said earlier that he would throw Xia Jingwu and the others into the Cold Prison; he had never expected that fate would turn on him so swiftly. As one of the eight Deputy Commanders, he understood the terror of the Cold Prison intimately.

The place was an innate realm of frozen ice; no matter how high one's cultivation, once imprisoned there, one's Saint Yuan would be sealed by the ice. In other words, entering the Cold Prison left one relying solely on the strength of the flesh to resist that bone-deep cold.

Without the protection of Saint Yuan, how many fighters could withstand that?

One month — it was practically a march toward the gates of death!

"Hmm?" Commander Lu Tianfeng said when he saw Bai hesitate, and he glared at him angrily.

“W–we accept, we yield!” Bai Zhengchu shrank his neck and nodded repeatedly.

"Good, accepting is fine; this is merely punishment for your assault, and for the damage to the Commerce Guild's buildings and goods... this is how it will be: hand over your Spatial Rings."

When Commander Lu Tianfeng said that, who dared resist? Each of them looked as if their parents had died; one by one they slipped the Spatial Rings from their fingers and handed them over.

Commander Lu Tianfeng chuckled and shoved a handful of rings toward Chairwoman Hua Youmeng, saying, "Chairwoman, please be magnanimous and do not bother with these fools — this is their compensation for the injuries."

"Commander..." Chairwoman Hua Youmeng was utterly bewildered; faced with the dazzling pile of Spatial Rings, she neither wanted to accept nor refuse and felt helpless.

"Chairwoman, please, do not decline," Commander Lu Tianfeng pleaded with a grave expression, imploring Chairwoman Hua Youmeng.

The person in the side room was still watching; if this matter were not handled well, he feared his position as Commander might be at risk.

Xia Jingwu stepped forward and laughed softly, cupped his fist toward Commander Lu Tianfeng and said, "Since Commander Lu personally upholds justice, the Commerce Guild will naturally cooperate fully. Thank you, Commander; your nobility earns my admiration!"

"No need to thank me..." Commander Lu Tianfeng took the opportunity to slip a Spatial Ring into Chairwoman Hua Youmeng's hand, secretly wiping the cold sweat from his brow, thinking the matter was at last settled; though far from perfect, it at least showed where he stood.

"What are you still standing there for? Get moving and go to the Cold Prison to accept your punishment!" Commander Lu Tianfeng barked at Bai Zhengchu and the others.

"Yes, yes!" Bai Zhengchu and the others immediately scattered like frightened beasts, fleeing that place of horror.

After all those subordinates had disappeared, Commander Lu Tianfeng turned, cupped his fist toward the side room and said with an awkward smile, "Sir, are you satisfied with how this was handled?"

Yang Kai's voice answered from inside, "Commander Lu, you're joking. Maintaining the city's peace and rewarding good while punishing evil is the Commander's duty. If you are satisfied, then that is enough — what business is it of mine?"

Hearing that, Commander Lu Tianfeng visibly relaxed, knowing the other would not pursue the matter further; he bowed and said, "You are right. I will take my leave. Rest well, sir!"

After saying that he also nodded cordially to Chairwoman Hua Youmeng and the others, then strolled out.

Chairwoman Hua Youmeng, Gao Hong, Xia Jingwu, Yao Qing, Haitang and the rest still stood there dumbfounded; each face showed extreme oddity — recalling the scenes that had just unfolded felt unreal, like being trapped within a dream.

Only after a long while did Hua Youmeng let out a muffled groan and exhale sharply. Mixed within her breath was a faint pink mist — the Flowery Rain Powder she had forced out of her body.

"Chairwoman, are you all right?" Gao Hong quickly asked, looking at her.

Chairwoman Hua Youmeng shook her head. In the earlier conflict with Bai Zhengchu and the others she had been the safest; the others had suffered injuries of varying degrees.

"Chairwoman, what do we do now..." Gao Hong glanced toward where Yang Kai was.

Chairwoman Hua Youmeng slowly shook her head and said, "Uncle Xia, close the shop's doors; suspend business for five days so the brothers can rest. For those injured, provide sufficient healing funds. As for these rings... ah, Uncle Xia, you handle them."

"Yes." Xia Jingwu answered as he took the rings.

"Yao Qing, Haitang, you two go help out," Chairwoman Hua Youmeng called to the side.

"Oh." Haitang obeyed and followed out dutifully. Yao Qing, however, looked angrily at the side room, his face full of ire as he muttered, "I want to..."

"What do you want?" Gao Hong glared and cut him off. "Hurry up and get out of here!"

Yao Qing rolled his eyes, grumbling something unintelligible, and left in a huff.

In the blink of an eye only Gao Hong and Chairwoman Hua Youmeng remained. The two exchanged a look and both detected hesitation in the other's eyes; they transmitted Divine Sense between them as if to communicate.

After a moment, Chairwoman Hua Youmeng sighed and said, "Thank you, sir, for your help today."

"Chairwoman, you are welcome — it was nothing," Yang Kai said with a faint smile. He had detected a trace of awe and chill in Chairwoman Hua Youmeng's tone, which was not unexpected, so he did not pay it much mind.

"I am weary from today; I will not disturb your rest further. I will come to visit you again tomorrow," Chairwoman Hua Youmeng said softly.

"No need to trouble yourself, Chairwoman — go about your duties. I will be fine on my own."

Chairwoman Hua Youmeng nodded, signaled Gao Hong with her eyes, and the two women left.

Inside the side room Yang Kai wore a helpless smile as he toyed with the token in his hand and murmured to himself, "I didn't expect this thing to be so useful; even someone like Lu Tianfeng behaved like a mouse before a cat when he saw it."

Commander Lu Tianfeng was a warrior of the First Stage of the Void King Realm; even if Yang Kai could subdue him by force, that alone would not make him so deferential — the cause of everything lay with this token.

"Of course," came a voice from the side — Zi Donglai. "This is our Purple Star’s Command Token. Whoever holds this token holds a status equivalent to one of Purple Star's three Great Elders. Lu Tianfeng is only of the Commander rank; he would never dare act wantonly before the token's holder." At that moment Zi Donglai's soul body floated over the Soul-Fixing Bowl; Yang Kai had placed it aside.

"How many of these Respected Tokens did Purple Star issue?" Yang Kai asked.

Zi Donglai thought for a moment and replied, "As far as I know, only two were issued, and both are held by experts of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. This token represents not only status but can, to a certain extent, mobilize Purple Star's resources and personnel. It would never be issued except to those who have made tremendous contributions to Purple Star."

"I see." Yang Kai nodded lightly, understanding the token's value.

He had found the thing while searching Zi Long's Spatial Ring. Although the materials used to craft it were rare, he had never paid it much mind until today when it finally proved useful.

He had no other choice. His original plan had been to steal the Star Emperor Token and then slip away from Purple Star unnoticed, but after the incident involving Chairwoman Hua Youmeng and the Commerce Guild, he could no longer proceed as planned.

Though Yang Kai did not fear Lu Tianfeng’s arrival, this was still Purple Star City. If they truly came to blows, it would only attract even stronger opponents.

So he asked Zi Donglai how to handle the present situation.

Zi Donglai strongly recommended he use the Command Token.

Once tried, it truly had miraculous effect.

Commander Lu Tianfeng had charged in with an aggressive aura and left groveling; without Yang Kai lifting a hand the whole matter had been resolved perfectly.

Yet by doing so he would likely draw Purple Star's attention to himself, which would increase the difficulty of stealing the Star Emperor Token. Yang Kai felt a headache at the thought; for now he could only proceed one step at a time.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai looked at Zi Donglai and said, "Give me a general rundown of Purple Star's situation: who the experts are, whether there are internal disputes, and so on."

Although Zi Donglai was reluctant, with his soul in Yang Kai's hands he dared not resist, and so he obediently explained many matters concerning Purple Star.

Yang Kai took careful notes, since the information might prove useful; at key points he would ask questions, and Zi Donglai answered everything without reservation.
