## Chapter 1809 — Planting

The matter of the Incarnation refining the Stellar Origin filled Yang Kai with eager anticipation, for if it truly succeeded, he would become the first ever Star Lord of two Cultivation Stars in the entire Star Domain's history.

The petty fame meant little; what mattered were the myriad benefits that came with becoming a Star Lord.

Just after he had advanced to the Void King Realm, he could clearly feel the bond between himself and the Dark Star, which lay tens of millions of li away, tighten by several degrees, and with his own cultivation rising, the Dark Star would surely receive no small nourishment in turn.

There was no doubt about that; the precise details, however, would have to be verified by returning to the Dark Star.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and quietly probed the state of the Incarnation. The next moment his expression shifted strangely; then he hastily flew upward to look down on the Floating Continent. After a moment his body trembled and he cried in astonishment, "What on earth is this?"

He stared down at the Floating Continent in utter disbelief, his eyes nearly bulging from their sockets.

The development exceeded his expectations and imagination; he never would have thought the Incarnation would behave like this while refining the Stellar Origin.

It was not that the Incarnation was failing to refine; on the contrary, in his sensing the refinement proceeded astonishingly smoothly. At some point the Incarnation had thoroughly absorbed the Origin into itself and become the Star Lord of the Floating Continent.

The aura of the Incarnation swelled greatly as a result.

That was not the crucial point; the crucial point was that the Incarnation had fused with the entire Floating Continent!

In his perception, the whole Floating Continent beneath him had become his Incarnation.

Looking afar, at one end of the Floating Continent a huge indistinct skull could be seen; though it had not yet fully formed, its rudiments were already present.

On both sides of the Floating Continent, there were signs that arms were forming.

At the other end, traces of two legs had appeared.

The Floating Continent now resembled a colossal giant, stretched out and slumbering within the void.

"Gulp!" Even Yang Kai, who had weathered great storms, swallowed nervously and felt cold sweat bead down his forehead.

What in the world was happening?

Yang Kai felt his mind in chaos; what he saw could not be explained by anything he knew—this was an eerie, uncanny sight.

He drew a deep breath to steady his spirit, closed his eyes, and probed once more into the state of his Incarnation.

His Incarnation still lay beneath the ground and had not changed much in appearance, but it had indeed fused with the entire Floating Continent. Moreover, under the interference of the Incarnation's will, the continent was shifting and reshaping according to its form.

"The Stone Puppet race's innate divine art! It actually intends to devour and refine the whole Floating Continent?" Receiving that feedback in his mind, Yang Kai was genuinely taken aback.

What a terrifying feat this was.

The Floating Continent might not be large, yet it still spanned two or three hundred thousand li in area. If the Incarnation could truly use the Stone Puppet's innate divine art to refine it successfully, it would become a stone giant, head to the heavens and feet to the earth.

Such an immense Stone Giant would exert a terrifying pressure by mere presence; even Void King Realm experts who confronted it would likely have only flight as an option.

Imagine a fist larger than a mountain falling—who would survive?

"No way," Yang Kai murmured, still as if in a dream, equal parts astonished and delighted.

Astonished because the Incarnation's action had exceeded his expectations; delighted because if it succeeded, he would gain a tremendous ally—one that would be mightier even than Xiaoxiao or Liu Yan.

The will of the Incarnation represented his own will. Although only a fragment of his Soul Incarnation controlled it, since the Incarnation had taken such action it meant everything was still within his grasp.

Running his cultivation method, Yang Kai calmed himself; he wanted to see whether the Incarnation's undertaking would truly succeed or whether it was only wishful thinking.

"Rumble..." Suddenly a humming roar rolled through the Floating Continent. The land shook violently, and from within came steady thudding sounds, like a beating heart.

With each beat, large chunks of earth were shattered into powder and dissipated into the void.

Countless intersecting, longitudinal ravines tore across the surface.

The scene resembled an impending apocalypse; the entire continent seemed on the verge of fracturing apart.

Yang Kai's expression hardened as he observed for a moment; soon he relaxed, realizing this was the process of refining the Floating Continent—those shattered lands were merely useless impurities.

Anything of slight value was preserved and ingested by the Incarnation for refinement.

Refining an entire continent, even one of only two or three hundred thousand li, would normally be impossible; yet the Incarnation was of Stone Puppet form and possessed the innate devouring divine art. Now, as the Star Lord of the Floating Continent, it controlled the land and enjoyed lordly privileges and conveniences that allowed it to accomplish such a feat.

He felt keen anticipation.

Yang Kai discovered that this Incarnation had brought him a tremendous surprise, and his heart surged with excitement.

Thud... thud...

The rhythmic sounds continued endlessly; the continent split increasingly quickly. The entire land visibly shrank, and the great skull and limbs Yang Kai had noticed began to clarify.

At this rate, it would likely take only a short while—an month or two at most—before the Incarnation finished refining everything.

Yang Kai hovered in the void and watched for several days to ensure all remained under the Incarnation's control, then finally set his mind at ease.

With nothing urgent to do, he produced the Xuan Realm Pearl and entered the Small Xuan Realm.

Sending out his Divine Sense, he soon perceived Liu Yan's aura; she was in seclusion somewhere emitting an unbearably fierce scorching heat.

It seemed she had swallowed a strand of Sun’s True Fire and was painstakingly refining it.

Even with her present strength, refining a strand of Sun’s True Fire was not easy, but once refined it would increase her power.

Yang Kai did not call to her; instead he withdrew the Everlasting Tree from his Spatial Ring.

A three-foot sapling, a few tender green leaves; on one leaf a milky, dew-like droplet had formed.

The Immortal Source Liquid! The healing sacred elixir said to flesh the bones and revive the dead.

Yang Kai produced a jade bottle and carefully collected the single drop of Immortal Source Liquid.

The Immortal Source Liquid originated on the Everlasting Tree itself; once produced it could be harvested, so his action had no effect on the tree.

The legendary Everlasting Tree was a heaven-and-earth treasure, every part precious—its leaves and roots teemed with boundless vitality. If one could refine the whole tree, one might even achieve an undying, imperishable body.

To share the heavens' longevity and join the earth's eternity—unchanging through the ages and everlasting—this would be true undying immortality.

Even a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert only lived for a few thousand years; with careful maintenance perhaps ten thousand, but there was a limit.

Yet a single Everlasting Tree could grant a martial artist immortality... Yang Kai's breath quickened.

Gazing at the Everlasting Tree for a long moment, Yang Kai scratched his head in frustration—he had no idea how to refine it.

This was a legendary heaven-and-earth treasure, more precious even than his own Warm Spirit Lotus—how could one refine such a thing?

The treasure sat before him and he could do nothing but watch; it vexed him deeply.

Tilting his head, Yang Kai tried to use his Divine Sense to seize the Everlasting Tree.

After all, when he had obtained the Warm Spirit Lotus he had done it that way; as fellow heaven-and-earth treasures, it was worth a try.

But no matter how he stimulated his Divine Sense, the Everlasting Tree did not respond.

He next attempted to refine it with his Saint Yuan.

Several days passed and Yang Kai grew dejected; he had tried every method he could think of—even nearly devouring the tree raw—yet he could not refine it.

Devouring it raw was unwise; who knew what drastic changes it would cause to his own body.

"Very well, I'll ask Yang Yan when I return—she has great divine arts and should know something," he resigned himself to a temporary halt.

After inspecting around the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai chose a spot and replanted the Everlasting Tree.

This heaven-and-earth treasure pulsed with vitality, so there was no fear it would not survive being planted; even placed on a Dead Star it would remain unharmed.

The Everlasting Tree settled in the Small Xuan Realm, and unimaginable vigor spread through the soil. In moments Yang Kai felt the realm become more vibrant; the other trees seemed greatly nourished and began to grow rapidly.

Even the land itself seemed to be mended and improved.

Seeing this, Yang Kai was moved; he took out the heaven-and-earth treasures he had gathered in the Lost Realm and carefully planted them around the Everlasting Tree.

To his great delight, those treasures quickly adapted to the soil and each gave off an aura of joy.

"Hmm... it looks like I can make a medicinal garden around the Everlasting Tree!" Yang Kai mused.

The reason Medicine Valley in the Lost Realm flourished was entirely because of the Everlasting Tree; with its vitality nurturing them, the heaven-and-earth treasures there grew rapidly.

Now that the Everlasting Tree had been settled in the Small Xuan Realm, with proper management this place could very well become another Medicine Valley.

Thinking this through, Yang Kai took out the medicinal herbs Lü Guichen had given him and planted a few that looked near death—Void King-Grade specimens.

A few days later, those plants actually revived.

These herbs had long been collected by Lü Guichen and their potency had waned; they should have been unable to revive, yet the Everlasting Tree possessed such a heaven-defying function.

"Ha!" Yang Kai laughed with joy.

Although he had failed to refine the Everlasting Tree and achieve undying immortality, this accidental discovery still brought him great gains.

Full of vigor, Yang Kai busied himself in the Small Xuan Realm.
