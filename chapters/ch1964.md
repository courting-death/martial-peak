## Chapter 1964 — Sect Master?

"Someone's come — hurry and act!" Wu Mengchuan suddenly went cold, shouting in a deep voice.

Yang Kai sensed the sound of someone entering at the Bone Prison's entrance and, without hesitation, lunged to Wu Mengchuan's side and grabbed one of the conical Secret Treasures fixed to his right hand.

That Secret Treasure seemed to have been forged from Yanling Gold; the moment Yang Kai gripped it he felt every ounce of power within him suppressed, unable to draw on even a fraction.

"Use the force of your flesh!" Wu Mengchuan reminded him.

Yang Kai nodded, the muscles on his arm bulging as he unleashed all his bodily strength.

With a soft ripping sound the conical Secret Treasure was pulled free, dragging out a smear of pitch-dark blood, thick and congealed as if on the verge of drying up, utterly devoid of normal color.

Yang Kai repeated the method and soon pulled the conical Secret Treasures from the other limbs of Wu Mengchuan.

Only then did the elder pinned to the wall fall to the ground, collapsing in a near-dead gasp while an eerie, raucous laugh kept escaping his lips.

Chains forged of Yanling Gold still bound him, unusually sturdy; Yang Kai tugged with all his strength but could not snap them. In the end he was forced to employ the Undying Five Elements Sword qi, and only then did the chains break apart.

The Undying Five Elements Sword qi was a body-tempering art and therefore not suppressed by Yanling Gold.

Freed, Wu Mengchuan stood up shakily, his greenish eyes beating faster and faster; he smiled low and carried an expression of mad hatred and grim delight: "Zhu Junshan, Bian Yuqing, Miao Qi, Tong Cong! Prepare to endure my wrath!"

Yang Kai felt a chill in his chest; the four names Wu Mengchuan spat out were unmistakably the four great Protectors of the Biyu Sect. Evidently Wu Mengchuan harbored an earth-shattering hatred for them. One could even suspect those four had a hand in torturing him to this state.

However...

Wu Mengchuan's present condition was barely clinging to life; he had only just escaped, yet he shouted such brazen boasts. Yang Kai thought his intentions were far from realistic.

He even regretted not fleeing immediately after freeing himself and instead squandering precious time helping this old man.

But regret changed nothing. Yang Kai considered for a moment and said, "Senior, our bargain is complete; I will not linger here. Let our fates be left to Heaven!"

He turned to leave.

Wu Mengchuan snorted softly and glanced sideways at Yang Kai. "What? You think I am no match for those fellows?"

Yang Kai frowned. "It's not that I distrust you, Senior, but given your current state..."

"Hmph!" Wu Mengchuan gave a disdainful snort and waved his hand boldly. "Follow behind me — I'll broaden your horizons."

His nonchalant manner startled Yang Kai for a moment; he had no idea what the elder planned. But since the old man had gone to great lengths to have him rescue him, it seemed unlikely he intended to die easily. Yang Kai restrained himself and followed.

Before long the two arrived before the cells holding many warriors.

On seeing Wu Mengchuan, the warriors who had earlier guided Yang Kai all grew excited and gathered at the prison doors, staring at Wu Mengchuan with eager eyes.

Wu Mengchuan stood in the corridor, looked around once, and then gave a low, dry chuckle; his shriveled hands slowly opened, and with that motion an inexplicable suction seemed to surge from his body.

Yang Kai was shocked; in that instant his Sea of Consciousness surged as if being pulled, his soul-force wanting to leave his body. His qi and blood churned violently and his whole body felt as if it had been set aflame.

He changed color and hastened to circulate his profound arts to suppress the discomfort, yet even so he strained to endure it.

The prisoners in the cells were not so fortunate. Seeing Wu Mengchuan assume that posture, cries of alarm erupted and the previous hope and fervor towards him vanished; they recoiled as if avoiding snakes and scorpions.

But there was only the prison wall behind them — where could they flee?

Screams rang out as blood-red lights streaked from the cells in every direction. Wu Mengchuan opened his mouth and inhaled, drawing those crimson lights entirely into his belly.

To the eye, his withered body visibly began to swell; his filthy robe billowed though there was no wind; the cracked skin exposed beneath glistened and his sparse white hair rapidly blackened and thickened.

He seemed suddenly reinfused with unimaginable vigor, instantly casting off his near-death state and transforming into one brimming with life.

Yang Kai's shock was boundless.

He clearly saw that the blood-red lights emanating from the cells were the qi-and-blood force and life essences of those warriors, and at that moment they were all becoming Wu Mengchuan's means and capital for growing stronger.

What kind of evil art was this to have such heaven-defying effect?

Yang Kai immediately thought of the Heaven Devouring Battle Art Wu Mengchuan had once given him. Though Yang Kai had not studied it carefully, he vaguely understood its nature; what Wu Mengchuan was using now was undoubtedly that very Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

This technique was so twisted and perverse — it could forcibly strip others of their qi-and-blood force and life essence for its user!

This art was also astonishingly potent, restoring a near-death man to full vigor in such a short time.

What kind of cultivation art could this be? Yang Kai dared not think further.

Yet he also knew that the more heaven-defying a technique appeared, the greater its drawbacks; the Heaven Devouring Battle Art must have flaws he had not yet discovered. Perhaps Wu Mengchuan's vicious nature was tied to it.

While Yang Kai brooded, the power within Wu Mengchuan surged at an incredible speed: from entering the Saint Stage to the Void King Realm in the span of three blinks, then the First Stage of the Void King Realm, the second, the third, then the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm... climbing steadily upward as if not yet at its limit.

If this old man claimed to be a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert, it seemed he was not boasting.

"Sect Master, spare me! We followed you faithfully back then, with utter loyalty and no regrets; even locked up all these years we never wronged you. Why do you treat us like this?" a warrior cried from within a cell.

Cries of begging rose from all directions, and they all addressed Wu Mengchuan as 'Sect Master.'

"Sect Master?" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed.

Which sect's Sect Master was Wu Mengchuan? Could he be the Biyu Sect's...?

The thought struck Yang Kai and jolted him.

He denied it instinctively, but after reflection the possibility was real.

Until now he had never learned the Biyu Sect's Sect Master's name. In the month since arriving at the Biyu Sect he had investigated its affairs; the four Protectors' names were long known, but when he asked Senior Brothers about the Sect Master's name, they all showed a look of deep taboo.

Once when he asked Kou Wu, Kou Wu scolded him for poking into matters — warning him to beware of causing trouble with his tongue.

Yang Kai had not understood at the time; now it became clearer.

This was interesting: the Biyu Sect's Sect Master was imprisoned at the deepest part of the Bone Prison, bound tight with Yanling Gold conical Secret Treasures and chains, tortured until unrecognizable. If not for a powerful body like Yang Kai's aiding him, Wu Mengchuan might never have escaped in his lifetime.

No wonder the secret technique he taught Yang Kai to break the restraint was so effective.

If he truly was the Biyu Sect's Sect Master, then he would naturally be familiar with his sect's forbidden arts.

The cries for mercy continued; each prisoner wore a deathly pallor and despair in their hearts. They had hoped that Wu Mengchuan's escape would free them and avenge past humiliations, but instead he used the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to strip them of their qi-and-blood force and life essence to empower himself.

Only when trust and hope were betrayed did they see Wu Mengchuan's cruel true face.

"I have felt the sincerity of your hearts, but I need power now. You swore to follow me to the death — now I ask you to fulfill that oath. Is that too much?" Wu Mengchuan ignored their pleas and screams, merely standing while he activated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, speaking calmly.

Hearing those words chilled Yang Kai to the bone.

If a leader is corrupt, the followers will be crooked. Yang Kai finally understood why the Biyu Sect cultivated such treacherous internal ways; with a Sect Master like Wu Mengchuan, what could be expected of his disciples?

If the upper beam is crooked, the lower beams will bow — Yang Kai finally understood why the Biyu Sect's cultivators were so full of scheming and backstabbing, even turning on their own. With a sect master of such character, how could the disciples be expected to be any different?

He must not entangle himself here any longer! Yang Kai resolved to leave the Bone Prison and flee the Biyu Sect; otherwise, with Wu Mengchuan's temperament, he might be killed one day.

Yang Kai had no desire to entrust his safety to anyone.

"Wu Mengchuan, you arrogantly claim descent from the Heaven Devouring Emperor and you shame the Emperor; I curse you — may you die a terrible death!" someone finally could not bear it and, seeing pleading useless and death inevitable, shouted an insult.

That explosive revelation stunned Yang Kai.

The Heaven Devouring Emperor?

Yang Kai had never heard of such a figure, but the words alone conveyed an extraordinary weight.

Only those who reached the Emperor Realm could be called an Emperor.

But an ordinary Emperor Realm expert had no right to bear a title. Only the outstanding figures within the Emperor Realm were worthy of possessing one. These titles differed from person to person, yet they often represented the Law that Emperor was most proficient in, the cultivation art they had mastered, or even the great achievements over the course of their lives.

A title represented a legend, an epic, and a world-shaking honor.
