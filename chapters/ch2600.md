## Chapter 2600 — Seizing His Origin

In that instant, cold sweat broke out on the backs of Fan Wu and the other two Saint Venerables, especially Cang Gou, whose face was full of relief as he secretly rejoiced at his narrow escape—he had almost been swayed by Shi Huo’s words to join forces with him just now.

Had that truly happened, he would likely be sharing in the humiliation of kneeling on the ground right now.

“He really... knelt down.”

Ten li away, the many Yao Kings stared wide-eyed, their jaws nearly dropping in shock, while the Stone Spirits they had been restraining were all visibly elated, secretly feeling a surge of satisfaction.

The Incarnation let out a cold chuckle, “If you don’t want to die, let us go now. Otherwise, you’ll all die miserable deaths in a moment.”

The Yao Kings and the eight Saint Envoys were startled by these words, exchanging glances before hurriedly leaping away from the Stone Spirits, no longer daring to trouble them.

Even an existence like Shi Huo had knelt at a single word from Zhang Ruoxi. How could these Yao Kings dare act recklessly? Their hearts were filled with unease, uncertain what fate awaited them.

Only then did the Stone Spirit Race and the Incarnation shake themselves off and stand up together, gazing off into the distance.

Over there, Shi Huo, still kneeling on the ground, seemed unable to believe what had just happened. The pitch-black flames in his eyes flickered violently, his mind on the verge of collapse.

He was a Divine Spirit, one of the Four Great Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land, yet he had knelt on the ground because of a young girl’s words? The humiliation was simply unbearable.

“Roar...” Shi Huo howled in rage, hysterical, desperately trying to stand, but at some point, a faint red glow had enveloped him, binding him so tightly he could not move at all.

Clang—

Ruoxi pointed the Heaven’s Punisher Sword at Shi Huo’s chest. As she did, the sky above churned with wind and clouds, and even the giant female phantom behind her began to move.

The enormous sheathed longsword was suddenly drawn by the phantom, pointing straight at Shi Huo’s location. Her magnified, beautiful face was cold and expressionless.

“The force of Heaven and Earth...” Fan Wu’s expression changed as he looked up at the sky, the bitterness in his mouth worse than swallowing bitter herbs.

If he had still doubted how much of Heaven’s Punisher’s power Ruoxi had inherited, and harbored thoughts of resistance, now those thoughts had vanished. The only thing left to consider was how to survive under Zhang Ruoxi’s hand.

With a single sword, she summoned the force of Heaven and Earth—this clearly meant the Heaven’s Punisher bloodline had fully awakened. Given enough time, Zhang Ruoxi would surely become a second Heaven’s Punisher, a nemesis that would make all Divine Spirits tremble in fear.

“You... what are you doing?” Shi Huo’s face changed wildly as he cried out in alarm, realizing the vast gap between himself and Zhang Ruoxi. He could no longer remain calm, his flame-like eyes full of unease and terror as he shouted, “This Lord is the Divine Spirit Shi Huo! Don’t think you can kill me!”

“Divine Spirit Shi Huo—merciless and cruel, a being who revels in slaughter. Here and now, Zhang Ruoxi, descendant of Heaven’s Punisher, will seize his Divine Spirit origin. Let all Divine Spirits of the world take heed: his power shall be stripped away as a warning to all.” Zhang Ruoxi’s face was expressionless, her tone cold and detached.

“What?” Shi Huo’s eyes widened as he cried out, “You want to seize this Lord’s Divine Spirit origin?”

Zhang Ruoxi did not answer. The Heaven’s Punisher Sword in her hand slowly thrust forward.

At the same time, the giant female phantom behind her also thrust her massive sword into Shi Huo’s body.

Shi Huo’s body was incomparably tough—even Fan Wu and the others, also Divine Spirits, could hardly hope to injure him. In terms of physical strength, he surpassed even the Stone Spirit Race.

Yet such a formidable body was as fragile as tofu before the Heaven’s Punisher Sword.

Zhang Ruoxi didn’t seem to use much force, but the Heaven’s Punisher Sword pierced straight into Shi Huo’s chest.

“No!” Shi Huo cried out in anguish, staring wide-eyed at his chest. Panic finally overtook him as he shouted, “No, you can’t take this Lord’s Divine Spirit Origin! This Lord is the Divine Spirit Shi Huo! This Lord refuses!”

Sss sss sss sss—

The sound of the Heaven’s Punisher Sword piercing Shi Huo’s body rang out, making Fan Wu and the others turn pale. Hearing that sound, they seemed to feel the pain of the blade piercing their own bodies.

Luan Feng’s delicate body trembled violently, her smooth back drenched in cold sweat.

“No, no, my Lord, Shi Huo was wrong! Please, my Lord, give Shi Huo a chance to change. Shi Huo will never do evil again!” Seeing that resistance was futile and his Origin Power was beginning to loosen, Shi Huo finally couldn’t help but beg for mercy.

He was a Divine Spirit, he had his pride. If not forced, how could he humble himself so?

Fan Wu and the others watched, feeling a pang of sorrow in their hearts.

But Zhang Ruoxi was unmoved. The Heaven’s Punisher Sword in her hand was almost completely buried in Shi Huo’s body, right up to the hilt.

“If you’d known this would happen, why act as you did before?” Ruoxi’s beautiful eyes flashed coldly as she gave the sword a fierce twist.

Boom—

A loud explosion rang out as a hole as wide as a person’s body was blasted through Shi Huo’s chest, piercing straight through.

Shi Huo shuddered violently, his once-mighty aura rapidly collapsing.

As the Heaven’s Punisher Sword trembled, something like a heart was flicked out. It still throbbed violently, thumping loudly, and within it was a power that made one’s heart tremble in fear.

“Shi Huo’s Origin...” Fan Wu’s face was pale, his body swaying as if he might fall.

He recognized at a glance that what Ruoxi held was the Divine Spirit Shi Huo’s Origin Power. Without it, Shi Huo was doomed to fall from the heights of a Divine Spirit and become an ordinary stone yao.

Luan Feng and Cang Gou were so shocked they could hardly breathe, their heads spinning.

Though their inherited memories told them Heaven’s Punisher could strip a Divine Spirit’s Origin Power, memory was one thing—witnessing it with their own eyes was another.

In all the world, perhaps only the Heaven’s Punisher lineage could so easily seize a Divine Spirit’s origin.

Shi Huo was finished.

Having lost his Origin, even if he survived by some miracle, he would be nothing but a cripple.

Looking over, Shi Huo was still kneeling in a daze, a gaping hole where his heart had been, a shocking sight. The black flames that had once burned on his body had vanished without a trace.

His aura was utterly depleted, not even as strong as an Emperor Realm cultivator.

With a wave of Ruoxi’s sword, a flash of light appeared, and Shi Huo’s massive body collapsed to the ground, shattering into a pile of rubble—utterly lifeless, dead beyond all doubt.

A pair of beautiful eyes swept coldly to the side. Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou all felt their hearts jolt, involuntarily retreating a few steps, their faces full of fear.

What they feared most now was that Zhang Ruoxi would turn her hand against them.

Judging by what had just happened to Shi Huo, if Zhang Ruoxi truly wanted to kill them, none of the three could escape. The suppressive force from within the Blood Gate was simply too terrifying, far beyond what they could resist. They weren’t even sure if it only targeted Divine Spirits, but Yang Kai didn’t seem affected at all.

Fortunately, Ruoxi only glanced at them coldly before turning her Heaven’s Punisher Sword and making a motion as if to sheathe it.

The Heaven’s Punisher Sword vanished in an instant, along with the giant female phantom behind her.

Fan Wu and the others all breathed a sigh of relief. Though they didn’t know what Zhang Ruoxi meant by this, it clearly showed they were not in immediate danger.

Turning her head, Ruoxi looked in Yang Kai’s direction.

At this moment, Yang Kai was in a wretched state—this was the most miserable he had ever been in his life. His clothes were stiff with dried blood, his face bruised and battered, eyes nearly swollen shut, his head bleeding, both legs broken. He had no strength to stand and could only slump on the ground.

Their eyes met, and Yang Kai gave a bitter smile.

He couldn’t tell whether Ruoxi’s transformation was a good thing or a bad thing.

Comparatively, he preferred the gentle, obedient Ruoxi of before. The descendant of Heaven’s Punisher standing before him now seemed cold-blooded and distant, her gaze and aura utterly unfamiliar.

After a moment of silence, Ruoxi reached out her hand. With a swish, a beam of light shot out from within the Blood Gate.

Fan Wu and the others turned pale again, quickly focusing their attention.

Last time, Zhang Ruoxi had summoned the Heaven’s Punisher Sword from within. What would it be this time?

To their surprise, what Ruoxi held was not some divine weapon, but a spirit fruit. The fruit was bright red and alluring, exuding an incredibly rich fragrance that made one’s mouth water.

In a flash, Ruoxi appeared before Yang Kai, crouched down, and handed him the spirit fruit.

Yang Kai didn’t take it, only staring at her in a daze. After a while, he finally asked, “Are you Ruoxi?”

Ruoxi nodded slightly and said softly, “Sir, it’s me. Eat this first—your injuries will heal quickly.”

“You...” Yang Kai said in surprise.

“Sir, Ruoxi is still Ruoxi. I won’t change.” As she spoke, the coldness and indifference in Ruoxi’s eyes gradually melted, replaced by a familiar warmth.

“Heh heh heh heh...” Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh, his mood suddenly much lighter.

He reached out and took the spirit fruit from Ruoxi, glancing at it. His expression changed slightly. “A Ten-Thousand-Year Phoenix Blood Fruit!”

The spirit fruit Ruoxi had summoned from the Blood Gate was actually a Ten-Thousand-Year Phoenix Blood Fruit.

This was a peerless treasure. The tree that bore this fruit could only be cultivated with the fresh blood of a Phoenix. The Phoenix race was among the most powerful of all Divine Spirits. Let alone killing one for its blood, even becoming their enemy was something few in the world could do.

To grow a Phoenix Blood Fruit tree required all the Essence-Blood of a Divine Spirit Phoenix. It would bloom once every ten thousand years and bear fruit once every ten thousand years. In terms of rarity, it was even more precious than the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus Yang Kai had encountered in the Four Seasons Land.

He never expected to see a Phoenix Blood Fruit appear before him now, and for Ruoxi to summon it so casually from the Blood Gate.

It was clear that there must be a Phoenix Blood Fruit tree inside the Blood Gate, likely cultivated with the blood of a Phoenix Race member slain by Heaven’s Punisher in the past.
