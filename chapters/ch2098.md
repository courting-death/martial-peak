## Chapter 2098 — Black Eye

Stars rained down across the heavens like meteors, each one carrying unimaginable power, slamming into the man surnamed Fu until he cried out in misery.

The Chasing Star Arrows and Starfall were secret techniques of the Star God Palace, so the fact that Hua Qingsi would use them made it plain: she belonged to the Star God Palace.

Once he realized that, a bitter taste lodged in Fu’s mouth as if he had swallowed bitter herbs.

From the very start he had put on an air of superiority, looking down on everyone else; what he relied on was nothing more than his profound cultivation and the backing of Fei Sheng Palace.

Across the entire Southern Territory, Fei Sheng Palace wasn't counted among the top sects, but it still had an Emperor Realm expert stationed there, which lent it some reputation.

If not for that, how would Ning Yuancheng back then—or this man surnamed Fu now—dare act so heedlessly, strutting about Fenglin City as though no one else existed?

Only now did Fu abruptly discover that Hua Qingsi’s background was even greater than his own, and the shock was mingled with mortified fury.

It felt like boasting about wealth before a beggar, only for that beggar to casually smash a few gold bricks in your face, leaving you humiliated and bruised.

In an instant Fu’s sense of superiority evaporated, and beyond that he felt clumsy and constrained.

His opponent came from the Star God Palace, one of the Southern Territory’s foremost sects — how could he dare treat such a person as an enemy?

If he lost, that would be one thing; but if he won… the consequences were unimaginable.

Thus a ludicrous scene unfolded: faced with Hua Qingsi’s endless array of secret techniques, Fu could only defend and dared not strike back.

Hua Qingsi, however, showed no intention of letting up; not only did she unleash secret techniques in succession, she even called forth secret treasures to utterly suppress Fu.

Elsewhere, Yang Kai, who stood quietly before the stone wall seal, was also groaning inwardly.

As Qin Yu had observed, when a mouthful of Yang Kai's Golden Blood was blasted onto the seal by Jiang Taisheng's self-destruction, Yang Kai inexplicably formed a mysterious bond with the seal.

He could clearly feel an immensely terrifying will beyond the seal, silently staring at him.

It froze him solid, rendering him utterly unable to move.

Even as the pure Ancient Demonic Qi poured into him, Yang Kai could do nothing but watch helplessly as it happened.

Yang Kai did not truly know what lay sealed behind the stone wall; only through Jiang Chuhe’s Sea of Consciousness had he seen fragments suggesting it was part of an Ancient Giant Demon’s body, though which part he could not say.

But since it was sealed here, that proved it was a presence that could not be destroyed. If those Emperor Realm experts of the ancient age could truly have eliminated this threat, they would not have been forced to seal it.

Over countless years the seal’s location changed many times; shifting geography eventually led to it being damaged by the Jiang Family.

As that pure Ancient Demonic Qi poured in, Yang Kai felt sick all over; his mind was no longer as clear as before, becoming muddled and dazed.

When Fu struck at him, he had thought this time he was surely doomed — who would have known that at the last moment it was Hua Qingsi who saved his life?

That left him both grateful and puzzled; he did not understand why Hua Qingsi had done so.

As time passed and more Demonic Qi flooded in, Yang Kai’s whole being vanished; the place where he stood became nothing but a pitch-black hole that seemed to devour all light.

In an instant, a tremendous voice reverberated through Yang Kai’s mind.

The sound seemed to shake from the depths of his soul, as if it were an ancient summons; it was ear-splitting yet impossible to make out, and Yang Kai’s seven orifices instantly bled.

The Golden Blood did not drip away; instead it was drawn by some mysterious force toward the stone wall, merging into the seal.

In that instant Yang Kai trembled all over, his eyes widening as he stared fixedly ahead.

In his world and in his sight, everything vanished; he felt as if he stood inside a black hole with no light, surrounded only by boundless darkness that bred despair and fear.

Above that pitch-black canopy hung a single, enormous solitary eye.

The lone eye almost obscured half the sky, utterly dark and deep, seeming to contain extremely profound mysteries that attracted Yang Kai’s soul and caused it to resonate.

"Black Eye!" Yang Kai cried out inwardly, instantly understanding that this was the Ancient Giant Demon’s jet-black solitary eye.

In Jiang Chuhe’s consciousness he had witnessed scenes of the ancient Black-Eyed Giant Demon shooting forth pitch-black mystical light from its single eye, turning mighty Emperor Realm experts into wrecks and shattering warships.

That pitch-black mystical light seemed even more potent than the power released by Imperial Treasures!

So that was it.

In that moment Yang Kai’s heart suddenly cleared; he finally understood what part of the Ancient Giant Demon had been sealed here.

It was, obviously, that single black eye!

The Ancient Giant Demon's black eye had been born from the very workings of heaven and earth — it was not something mortal hands could destroy.

Even those all-seeing, world-shaking powerhouses had exhausted every means and still could not make that single eye disappear; they had no choice but to seal it.

Though he understood, Yang Kai could do nothing at that moment.

Even though the Ancient Giant Demon itself had long since perished, a portion of its will still dwelt within that black eye, so powerful that a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator could not withstand it.

Yang Kai could only stand by and watch, utterly powerless.

Beneath that heaven-covering black eye, Yang Kai felt as insignificant and trivial as an ant.

Slowly, the solitary eye seemed to notice Yang Kai’s existence and turned its gaze toward him.

In an instant Yang Kai felt an intense pain within his Sea of Consciousness, his soul on the verge of being torn apart; he could not help but cry out.

Boundless Demonic Qi poured through the breach in the seal, endlessly flooding into his body. His flesh and blood ruptured under its assault, only to knit back together and be reborn in an instant beneath the combined force of his Golden Blood and the Demonic Qi.

The pain was more excruciating than the legendary tearing by a thousand knives.

What terrified Yang Kai even more was that the solitary black eye that had hovered in the air was rapidly approaching him.

He could distinctly feel a note of joy emanating from that black eye, as if after waiting countless years it had finally found what it sought.

A moment later, the black eye enveloped Yang Kai and, like an invisible substance, surged into his body.

At that moment, a pitch-black pillar of energy burst forth from Yang Kai, blasting into the heavens, rending the clouds and soaring to the very zenith of the sky.

The boundless Demonic Qi that filled tens of thousands of li seemed to be drawn as well, rolling in from near and far to converge crazily upon Yang Kai.

Within that Demonic Qi, countless demonized creatures turned their bodies and fixed their gaze upon Yang Kai’s location.

Devoid of reason and ignorant of life or death, they nonetheless betrayed expressions of joy and knelt to the ground, showing devout worship.

It was as if a king who had waited a thousand years had finally returned, as if an invincible sovereign had awakened…

Five hundred li away, Duan Yuanshan supported Qin Yu and the unconscious Qin Chaoyang, engaged in a bloody fight against a swarm of demonic creatures.

The fiends themselves were not difficult to deal with—their cultivations were uneven, far from a match for Duan Yuanshan. But their numbers were simply overwhelming, and with him needing to shield the two members of the Qin Family, he soon found himself stretched perilously thin.

Seeing the defensive circle on the verge of being breached, Duan Yuanshan, furious and alarmed, no longer cared for his own losses; he bit his tongue and burned his Essence-Blood.

At that moment a harsh howl came from afar, tearing through eardrums; Demonic Qi churned and the demonic creatures fell to their knees, suddenly ignoring them altogether.

Duan Yuanshan’s eyes narrowed. Though he couldn’t fathom exactly what had happened, he knew time would not wait; with no thought to contend with those boundless fiends, he swept the two Qin Family members up, rose into the air, and tore off madly toward Fenglin City.

Along the way, the dense throngs of demonic creatures all knelt to the ground; the demonized beasts crawled in place, unmoving.

"What’s happening?" Duan Yuanshan wondered, glancing back but seeing nothing; only an all-enveloping blackness met his eyes, yet he could clearly feel a terrifying wave of energy emanating from the seal.

In Fenglin City, atop the various walls, countless cultivators gaped in disbelief.

The monstrous creatures that had been rampaging against the defensive barrier had, in the span of a single breath, gone completely still, as though they had all been struck dead.

Those with keener sight peering through the dark Demonic Qi could still make out vague outlines of the creatures, but all of them either knelt or crawled… utterly motionless.

Not far from the seal, Hua Qingsi and Fu also ceased their pointless struggle, staring with widened eyes down below.

The towering jet-black pillar of energy filled them with dread; the shocking presence issuing from Yang Kai made them tremble all over.

The sensation was more terrifying than facing a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert.

The two exchanged a look and simultaneously retreated ten li to avoid being affected.

"Do you sense it? The Demonic Qi seems to be converging in that direction!" Hua Qingsi said gravely.

Fu nodded coldly, then sneered, "It seems your Young Brother is doomed."

"Why are you taking pleasure in that?" Hua Qingsi snorted.

"This Lord... I'm merely speaking the truth. Why are you so worked up?"

Since learning of Hua Qingsi’s true identity, Fu no longer dared to call himself a Lord in her presence; yet he remained puzzled why she seemed so attached to Yang Kai. With her level of power it was impossible for her to have romantic feelings for a man she had just met—after all, they were centuries old; one did not fall in love so easily.

He vaguely suspected that Hua Qingsi harbored some other hidden purpose.
