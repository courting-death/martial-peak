## Chapter 2387 — Life Is Cheap

As soon as she finished speaking, a few miserable screams suddenly rang out.

Yu Leping and the others’ faces changed drastically. They all turned to look, only to see that a few of their own martial artists had turned blue in the face, foaming at the mouth, trembling as they collapsed to the ground, and in the blink of an eye, their lives were snuffed out.

“Snakes, so many snakes!” someone cried out in terror.

At some point, the deck had become densely covered with snakes of all sizes, and the air was instantly filled with a nauseating stench—clearly the accumulated snake venom. Just inhaling it made people feel dizzy and lightheaded.

A strange sound rang out as Snake Lady brought her slender jade hand to her lips and blew gently. The venomous snakes seemed to receive a command, leaping up from where they were like arrows, shooting straight at Yu Leping and his group.

A few of the weaker martial artists, already dizzy from the snake venom, couldn’t dodge in time and were bitten directly. In less than ten breaths, those bitten fell stiffly to the ground, dying on the spot.

On the other side, Man Kuai, seeing Snake Lady had made her move, let out a thunderous shout and summoned a massive bronze hammer taller than a man, sweeping it forward with a mighty swing.

The martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion, already thrown into chaos by the endless tide of venomous snakes, instinctively leapt into the air, desperate to escape the writhing mass below. But just then, Man Kuai’s massive hammer swept across with a thunderous roar. Origin Qi surged, and a vortex of power spiraled around the giant weapon, its pull so strong that those caught near its edge found themselves trapped—unable to advance or retreat.

Boom…

A dull thud sounded, and several martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion were smashed to pieces on the spot, leaving not a single bone behind.

Before the few lucky survivors could even catch their breath, the always-silent Sangde suddenly let out a cold snort. A formation flag appeared in his hand out of thin air, and he tossed it into a certain spot in the void. Instantly, a formation’s glow flickered across the multi-deck ship, tightly sealing it off and even suppressing flight.

The martial artists who had leapt into the air all cried out in alarm as they plummeted from above.

Sss sss sss sss…

Shen Fei, sword in hand, radiated killing intent. Like a breeze, he swept into the crowd, his movements unpredictable. Each swing of his sword claimed another enemy, and with every strike, a foe fell with a scream.

“You dare lay a hand on this Lord!” Yu Leping no longer had his previous composure. His hair was disheveled, his body covered in blood. Though he hadn’t been killed in the earlier ambush, he was clearly badly injured.

Of the fifteen City Lord’s mansion martial artists who had come with him, only three remained after the blink of an eye. All three were at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but Yu Leping was the strongest among them.

Though the three were in a sorry state, they formed a triangle, supporting each other and barely managing to hold their ground against attacks from all sides.

Unable to break through, Snake Lady and the others immediately eased their assault, afraid of pushing Yu Leping into doing something reckless.

Meanwhile, on the City Lord’s mansion’s multi-deck ship, the few martial artists left behind saw the fierce battle and their own side suffering heavy losses. They were so terrified their faces turned pale, frozen in shock, not even thinking to flee at first.

“Brat, you’re actually slacking off!” the Snake Lady shrieked, staring at Yang Kai as though she’d just realized it for the first time.

In the earlier fight, everyone had acted—except Yang Kai. He simply stood there, as if watching a good show.

Today’s events were clearly stirred up by Yang Kai. If not for his grudge with Yu Leping, the other side would never have chased them out to sea, leading to this conflict.

Yet while everyone else had acted, the instigator Yang Kai remained indifferent. How could Snake Lady not be furious?

Shen Fei and Man Kuai didn’t say anything, but their faces also showed displeasure.

“Who says I was slacking off?” Yang Kai shot back sharply, his face full of disdain. “Are you blind? I'm holding the line for you.”

Snake Lady trembled with rage. She found this Yang Kai utterly infuriating—ever since boarding the ship, he’d never given her any face, always opposing her as if they had some deep-seated enmity. Now he dared to lie with his eyes wide open, claiming to be holding the line when he was clearly loafing around. Shameless!

Gritting her silver teeth, she secretly vowed to herself that she’d make Yang Kai pay and let him know the consequences of offending a woman.

“If you’re holding the line, then now’s the time. These three are yours to deal with!” Sangde, apparently also dissatisfied with Yang Kai’s lazy attitude, said coldly.

“What about those guys?” Yang Kai pointed at the martial artists still on the City Lord’s mansion’s multi-deck ship. Whether they lacked combat experience or were simply scared stiff, they hadn’t thought to run until Yang Kai pointed at them. Only then did they panic and start fleeing in all directions.

“Leave them to me. You just need to handle Yu Leping and his lot.” With a snort, Sangde leapt from the multi-deck ship like a great roc spreading its wings, exuding a powerful aura as he chased after the fleeing martial artists.

Those few weren’t very strong, left on the ship just to watch over it. Even if they scattered, they couldn’t possibly escape Sangde’s pursuit. Their deaths were only a matter of time.

“Brat, still not making a move!” Snake Lady urged when she saw Yang Kai still standing there. She, Shen Fei, and Man Kuai had the three surrounded, but they weren’t easy opponents. Working together, they defended flawlessly.

“The longer this drags on, the more trouble. Brother Yang, hurry up,” Shen Fei urged impatiently.

“Brother Yang, is it? A few days ago, I was blind and offended you. Please, Brother Yang, be magnanimous and spare me this time. I, Yu Leping, will repay you handsomely!” Yu Leping pleaded, his face pale as Yang Kai looked his way, speaking rapidly.

If he’d known this trip to sea would threaten his life, how could he have acted so rashly? Wouldn’t it have been better to stay on Tongtian Island, enjoying himself and throwing his weight around, where no one dared disrespect him?

He never imagined that someone as influential as himself on Tongtian Island would be nothing out here in the deep sea. Snake Lady and the others were not to be trifled with. He knew begging them was useless, so he could only plead with Yang Kai.

“I have a million Source Crystals! I’ll give them all to Brother Yang—just let me go!” Yu Leping, realizing empty promises wouldn’t work, quickly offered something real.

“A million Source Crystals!” Snake Lady and the others’ eyes instantly turned red with greed.

Though they had some fame and strength on Tongtian Island, the Source Crystals they’d painstakingly earned were barely enough for their own use, with nothing left over. Hearing Yu Leping had a million Source Crystals, they stared at him like hungry wolves eyeing fresh meat, unable to look away.

If they could get their hands on that million Source Crystals, this trip would be worth it.

Thinking this, Snake Lady frantically winked at Yang Kai, signaling him to play along and agree for now—just get the Source Crystals first.

Yang Kai ignored her completely, looking at Yu Leping with contempt. “A mere million Source Crystals and you want to buy your life?”

Mere… Snake Lady and the others’ faces all darkened. A million Source Crystals, and he calls it ‘mere’? Does this brat even understand numbers?

Yu Leping wailed, “Brother Yang, my life is cheap!”

“I can see that. You really are a wretch!” Yang Kai snorted.

Yu Leping pleaded, “Brother Yang, please be magnanimous and spare me!”

Who under the eaves does not bow their head? Even knowing hope was slim, Yu Leping couldn’t give up seeking that sliver of survival.

Yang Kai sneered, then turned to the two martial artists beside Yu Leping. “Do you want to live, or die?”

The two, already terrified, not knowing when their defense would be breached, hurriedly nodded. “We want to live! We want to live!”

From Yang Kai’s words, it sounded like they still had a chance!

“If you want to live, help me kill him!” Yang Kai pointed at Yu Leping. “I have a grudge with him, not you. As long as you help me kill him, I’ll let you live.”

At this, Yu Leping’s face changed dramatically, while the other two City Lord’s mansion martial artists hesitated, weighing their options.

Yu Leping shouted, “Don’t listen to him, brothers! He’s trying to sow discord. If I die, they definitely won’t let you go!” He glared at Yang Kai. “You’re so insidious!”

Knowing Yang Kai would never spare him, Yu Leping no longer bothered to beg.

The other two City Lord’s mansion martial artists frowned. They knew Yang Kai was trying to drive a wedge between them, but at the brink of life and death, his offer was still tempting.

“You two aren’t really…” Yu Leping watched their expressions, his heart filled with dread. If Yang Kai succeeded in turning them, he’d have no way out.

With that thought, he let out a long howl, gathering all his strength, and shot into the air like an arrow, trying to escape.

“Yu Leping, you…” The two remaining martial artists’ faces changed drastically.

The only reason they’d survived so far was because the three of them had defended together, and Snake Lady and the others hadn’t pressed too hard, maintaining a delicate balance.

But now, with Yu Leping abandoning them, their defensive circle instantly developed a huge gap.

Man Kuai’s massive iron hammer swept across, and the venomous snakes swarmed in. In the blink of an eye, the two remaining martial artists were devoured.

Yu Leping didn’t even make it five zhang high before he fell back down in disgrace. The flight-restricting formation on the multi-deck ship was clearly of a high grade—he couldn’t resist it at all.

Shen Fei, who had been prepared for this, swept in with his long sword wrapped in a shimmering arc of light, instantly drawing Yu Leping into a deadly curtain of sword flashes.
