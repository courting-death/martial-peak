## Chapter 1457 — Affairs of the World Are Uncertain

After all, they had no grudge between them, and Yang Kai was not a cold‑blooded man; there was no need to slaughter the innocent. Besides, even if he refused to strike, at her current state she would not be able to live much longer.

No matter how one looked at it, the peril faced by the three from Qiantian Sect was inseparable from this woman. Had she not tried to divert disaster onto others, the three from Qiantian Sect would never have fallen into such grave danger.

Thinking so, Yang Kai crouched down, straightened her body, and reached out to sweep aside the black hair that concealed her face.

In an instant her face came into view, and Yang Kai’s expression froze; in the next breath his pupils contracted sharply and an incredulous expression spread across his face as he blurted, “How is this possible?”

He looked as if he had seen a ghost at noon, as though witnessing something utterly unbelievable.

“What? Sect Master Yang knows her?” Gu Zhen, always crafty, immediately formed a conjecture.

Yang Kai did not answer. His features shifted like weather, his gaze repeatedly sweeping over the woman’s face. The more he looked, the more shocked he became—this woman’s appearance was identical to that of a woman in his memory, with almost no difference; though two or three decades had passed, Yang Kai’s impression of her had not faded.

Only… was she truly the woman from his memories?

If she was not, then the coincidence would be absurd. In this vast world there might be people who resembled one another, but never would there be someone exactly the same; yet if she was indeed that woman, how could she have appeared here?

For a while Yang Kai’s emotions rode a turbulent tide, and past scenes flickered through his mind like a galloping parade. One scene after another rose up in his thoughts.

What puzzled Yang Kai most was that since she was here, the other woman should also have been present—so why was she alone? This plainly made no sense.

“Sect Master Gu, I need to heal her wounds; please guard me!” Yang Kai had no time to indulge in speculation. The woman before him had her eyes tightly shut; though unconscious, pain still marked her brow, and the life within her seemed to be ebbing rapidly. If he did not act in time to save her, she would soon perish.

Whether or not she was the one he suspected, Yang Kai resolved to rouse her and question her carefully.

“Rest assured, Sect Master Yang,” Gu Zhen said solemnly. “I swear on my life—no one will disturb you!”

“Thank you.” Yang Kai said little, lifting the woman to sit cross‑legged before him. He seized her fair wrist, and poured Saint Yuan and Divine Sense into her, probing her condition.

As he examined her, Yang Kai’s face slowly darkened.

Her injuries were worse than he had imagined. Her internal organs were all displaced, and furthermore some other energy raged within her meridians—what kind of attack had inflicted such damage was unclear.

Such injuries were grievous; an ordinary warrior would be helpless. All one could do was expend Saint Yuan to keep her clinging to life, striving to maintain her vital spark.

For Yang Kai it was also a dilemma—he had little confidence that he could fully save her, but having come so far, he could only act decisively.

With that, Yang Kai reached to his Spatial Ring, retrieved a jade bottle, and without hesitation opened it, producing a single pink pill.

The pill gave off a delicate fragrance and brimmed with spirit; it was plainly of high grade.

Gu Zhen, though serving as protector, had been watching the scene. The moment he saw the spirit pill in Yang Kai’s hand his face showed surprise, for if he was not mistaken that pink pill ought to be a Lower‑Level Void King‑Grade healing saint pill!

Void King‑Grade pills were treasures throughout the Dark Star and even the whole Star Domain—so precious that those who could refine them were Void King‑Grade alchemists.

If that were all, it would be surprising enough, but the crucial thing was that the pink pill even bore pill patterns!

Gu Zhen’s eyes nearly bulged. He immediately suspected the woman’s relationship with Yang Kai was not simple—otherwise Yang Kai would not risk such a precious pill to heal her.

A pill like that was scarce across the Star Domain; if returned to Dark Star it would send countless experts into a frenzy.

Just what was this woman’s background that Yang Kai would go so far to save her life? Curiosity flared in Gu Zhen.

That Void King‑Grade spirit pill had originally been obtained in that hidden valley; Yang Kai had not expected it to be needed so soon. With his own alchemy he could not have produced such a pill.

When they had distributed pills in the valley with the young wife from Ice Heart Valley, Yang Kai had deliberately set aside various pills for different uses, naturally including those for healing.

Though a Void King‑Grade pill’s efficacy was great, in the woman’s present condition taking it might be either blessing or curse—if her body could not withstand it she might die even sooner.

With that thought, Yang Kai gently drew a breath and forced a drop of pure Golden Blood from his body into the pink pill, then pinched the woman’s cheek and popped the pill into her mouth.

With the pure Golden Blood reinforcing her life and qi, there was no need to fear the pill’s power bursting through and harming her.

The rest depended on helping her refine the pill’s effect.

Yang Kai did not hesitate to take her delicate hands in his, pouring pure, masculine Saint Yuan steadily into her and guiding the circulation of the Saint Yuan within her body.

As time passed, Mo Yu and Shen Shitao had both finished recuperating. They came to Gu Zhen, asked about the situation, and then quietly stood aside to watch.

Under the pill’s effect and Yang Kai’s guidance, the grievously wounded woman’s complexion gradually improved; her organs were slowly repaired, and the marauding energy in her meridians was expelled.

After two full hours she suddenly uttered a soft sound and spewed a clump of black blood that shot toward Yang Kai’s face.

Quick‑eyed, Yang Kai casually swatted the clump aside.

Only then did he finally exhale.

At last he had pulled her back from the gates of death, though to recover fully she would need a long period of rest, and in the short term her combat strength would be less than half; within the Imperial Garden such a state was perilous—should trouble arise she would be helpless.

After coughing up the black blood, the woman’s eyelashes trembled as if about to wake.

Yang Kai rejoiced beyond measure.

A moment later she truly opened her beautiful eyes, though still uncertain of the situation; her gaze was bewildered. When she saw the man seated cross‑legged before her she paused, staring at Yang Kai speechless.

Yang Kai did not dare to speak hastily, fearing the answer might not be what he wished.

Long moments passed before the woman reached out a trembling hand, seeming to want to touch Yang Kai’s cheek. A flicker of emotion crossed his eyes; he did not pull away.

“They truly know each other!” Shen Shitao murmured, watching from the side. “And it seems their relationship runs deep.”

A meeting with an old acquaintance in a foreign place was surely a joyful thing; Shen Shitao felt glad for Yang Kai and was secretly moved by the reunion after so many years.

In the next instant an unexpected scene unfolded.

When the woman’s small hand was only three inches from Yang Kai’s cheek, it suddenly changed from a caress to a slap, as if to strike him—though she had no strength. The motion looked more like playful teasing, exceedingly ambiguous.

“Damn it! The first person I see after dying turns out to be you! After Lord waited for you all these years, how could you die too? Wasn’t it said that good people die young while scourges live for a thousand years?”

As she berated him, tears spilled from her beautiful eyes like pearls cut loose from a string, falling steadily as though heartbroken.

“Biluo?” Yang Kai’s face twitched as he rasped the name from his throat.

At that moment he could finally be certain of her identity—his guess had been right. She was indeed the woman he had known before; otherwise he could not have recognized her at a glance.

Biluo, the personal maid of the Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo!

Their parting at Cangyun Evil Land had been nearly thirty years ago; Yang Kai never imagined he would meet Biluo here.

Affairs of the world truly are uncertain!

He had yearned to reunite with Su Yan in the Imperial Garden but had failed; instead he saw Xue Yue and the woman he had thought he would never see again, Biluo.

For no other reason than this—over the years, though he had yet to reunite with Su Yan, he at least had some clue of her whereabouts and knew she was still alive. But as for the Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo and Biluo, he hadn’t heard a single trace of news.

The last time he left Zhongdu for the Tongxuan Continent was his final meeting with Shan Qingluo and Biluo.

Nearly ten years later, when he returned to Zhongdu he once went to Cangyun Evil Land in search of Shan Qingluo but could no longer find either woman. After inquiries he learned from the Lightning Shadow King that Shan Qingluo and Biluo had last gone to the Spider Mother’s Nest. When Yang Kai reached the nest he found only an altar; whether Shan Qingluo and Biluo lived or died he had no way to tell.

From then on he had thought he would never see Shan Qingluo or Biluo again.

Who could have imagined that the Imperial Garden trip would unfold such a dramatic scene?

For a time Yang Kai felt as if in a dream and scarcely dared to believe it.

While Yang Kai stood dazed, Biluo seemed to realize she had not died; she felt a little embarrassed, but even more she was joyful.

She had not expected to see Yang Kai again here.

Although the bastard had bullied her back then and caused the Enchantress Queen to pine after him for years, it could not be denied that to encounter him in a place like this at a time like this stirred Biluo’s heart; her beautiful eyes shone with a new light, and even her anger seemed much diminished.
