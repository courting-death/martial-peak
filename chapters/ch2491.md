## Chapter 2491 — Eccentric Expert

Yang Kai said in a low voice, "I've seen him a few times. He was always active in Fenglin City before. Last time, when your Star God Palace's Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda opened, he was inside selling some so-called ancestral Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill that could supposedly bring the dead back to life! He even tricked Xiaoqi out of some Source Crystals!"

"Is that true?" Everyone was shocked on the spot.

Lan Xun's expression darkened as she said, "Isn't he just a swindler?"

As for this Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill, Lan Xun had never even heard of it, let alone believed it could bring the dead back to life. Any Spiritual Medicine with such an effect would be a supreme treasure of heaven and earth, something to be hidden away, not hawked around for sale.

Originally, when this old man had stepped forward so confidently, Lan Xun thought she had encountered some extraordinary expert and felt a glimmer of hope. But after hearing Yang Kai's words, her heart immediately sank to the bottom.

Judging by the old man's previous behavior, he clearly didn't have any real ability. At this moment, he was obviously just spouting nonsense. If he got close to Mo Xiaoqi, who knows what might happen?

Liang Qiu shouted angrily, "Old man, get out of my way this instant!"

No matter what, Mo Xiaoqi's current situation was at least a little bit his responsibility. Even if it wasn't much, if something really happened to Mo Xiaoqi, the Beast Great Emperor might not listen to his explanations. So, seeing that the old swindler was already near Mo Xiaoqi, he hurriedly thrust out his spear, trying to force the old man back to prevent him from making things worse for Mo Xiaoqi.

Right now, Mo Xiaoqi was merely in the process of having her seal undone—there was no real danger to her. But if anyone tried to interfere or tamper with her at this critical moment, it could easily lead to her untimely demise. That was a risk Liang Qiu absolutely could not take.

The spear thrust out, an astonishing power exploded, as if it could pierce through the void, ignoring the barriers of space. In an instant, it struck right in front of the old swindler.

However, though Liang Qiu's spear was impressive, it carried no killing intent. He didn't intend to kill the old man, just to drive him back.

Yet, facing an attack from an Emperor Realm master, the old swindler remained calm, as if he hadn't sensed any danger at all. His slightly narrowed eyes shone with a sharp light, fixed intently on Mo Xiaoqi.

Only when the spear intent arrived did he gently wave his hand.

It was as if he were casually swatting away a mosquito, his expression relaxed, his movements unhurried.

An astonishing scene unfolded. With just a wave of the old swindler's hand, the brilliant spear light was instantly extinguished, and the fierce power stirred up by the spear was smoothed away in a heartbeat.

It was as if Liang Qiu had just attacked not an old man at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but someone at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Every gesture of the old swindler exuded the bearing of a true master, making him seem unfathomable.

The stark visual contrast left everyone dumbfounded. All eyes were wide as they stared at him, utterly shocked.

Liang Qiu couldn't believe his own eyes. After a moment of daze, he rubbed his eyelids hard, wanting to see more clearly.

But over there, the old man stood perfectly unharmed. Not even his clothes were wrinkled.

"What the hell!" Liang Qiu cried out in shock. While stunned, he was also deeply shaken, feeling inexplicably discouraged.

Earlier, relying on his Emperor Realm cultivation, he had tried to teach Yang Kai a lesson, only to be neutralized with a single punch. Now, trying to drive back the old man, his spear light was dispersed just as easily.

If it hadn't happened to him personally, Liang Qiu would never have believed such things possible in this world.

These days, are Dao Origin Realm cultivators all so arrogant and domineering? Can they just casually dissolve an Emperor's attack? If that's the case, why bother risking everything to advance to the Emperor Realm? Might as well stay in the Dao Origin Realm for life.

Or... is his Emperor Realm fake?

In an instant, countless thoughts flashed through Liang Qiu's mind. The joy and pride from breaking through to the Emperor Realm were gone, replaced by utter dejection.

Yang Kai was also shocked.

Although he had blocked Liang Qiu's attack earlier, he couldn't deny Liang Qiu's strength. If it were a life-and-death battle, even if he could win, it wouldn't be easy. After all, Liang Qiu was exceptionally talented, the top disciple of the Hundred Barbarian Mountain, a great sect in the Western Territory, a genius among millions.

He had some idea of the power behind that spear. If he were in the same position, it wouldn't be too hard to resolve, but he could never do it as effortlessly as the old swindler.

Just what was this old man? Could he be some expert hiding his true strength?

But thinking carefully, that didn't seem likely. Back when the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda of Star God Palace opened, only Void King Realm cultivators could enter. Since the old man got in, he must have been at the Void King Realm then.

In the years since, for him to reach the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was already fast enough. It was basically impossible for him to have hidden his cultivation.

It's just... Yang Kai had no idea how he managed to dissolve Liang Qiu's attack.

Not only Yang Kai, but no one present understood what had happened. The shocking scene left everyone unable to calm down.

But after this, no one dared to look down on the old swindler anymore.

Even if he really was a swindler, being able to dissolve an Emperor Realm attack with a wave of his hand meant he was a capable swindler!

"Young man, don't be so impulsive. I'm old and frail, not as energetic as you youngsters. I can't take much rough treatment," the old man said lightly after dissolving Liang Qiu's attack.

Liang Qiu's face darkened. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being mocked for his incompetence.

"Senior..." Lan Xun looked at the old man, her voice trembling. "Do you really have a way to solve Little Sister Xiaoqi's problem?"

After witnessing the old swindler's astonishing skill, Lan Xun regained some confidence in him. In this world, there were always some eccentric experts, hidden in the wild or among the masses. They might seem ordinary, but at critical moments, they would shine brilliantly.

Maybe, the old swindler Yang Kai spoke of was just such an expert.

Overcome with emotion, Lan Xun even changed how she addressed him. Though they were both at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, she called him "Senior."

Unexpectedly, the old man accepted it without hesitation, smiled slightly, and said, "I can give it a try."

Lan Xun's beautiful eyes lit up as she exclaimed, "Senior, do you know the Burning Moon Rainbow Seal? I heard from my father that the Beast Great Emperor used the Burning Moon Rainbow Seal to seal the Illusory Heaven Butterfly. It's incredibly profound and complex. In the whole world, only the Burning Moon Rainbow Seal can seal a Divine Spirit's Spirit Essence."

The old man shook his head and said, "The Burning Moon Rainbow Seal is a secret art that the Beast Great Emperor never passed on. I’ve never had the fortune to even glimpse it."

Lan Xun's expression dimmed. "Then what should we do?"

She had thought this senior knew the sealing technique, but now, hearing him say otherwise, her heart turned cold.

The Radiant Moon Great Emperor had personally told her that, to seal a Divine Spirit's Spirit Essence, there was no other way but the Burning Moon Rainbow Seal. Since this senior didn't know the secret art, how could he seal it?

It made sense. The Burning Moon Rainbow Seal was the Beast Great Emperor's own creation. Even when her father asked about it, the Beast Great Emperor would dodge the question and never reveal a thing.

"That Beast Great Emperor is so stingy!" The words of the Radiant Moon Great Emperor echoed in Lan Xun's ears.

"That guy, while strong, is stingy by nature. He won't even share his best wine with friends, so how could he pass on the Burning Moon Rainbow Seal?" the old man grumbled, his voice low but clear enough for the nearby Emperor Realm masters to hear.

With a crash, a bunch of people fainted on the spot.

The Beast Great Emperor was one of the current Ten Great Emperors, with unfathomable cultivation and a transcendent status. To all the cultivators of the Star Realm, he was like a god. Just mentioning his name inspired awe and reverence. He was practically the symbol of supreme power in the Star Realm. Yet, in the old man's mouth, he became "that guy"...

That was just too disrespectful to a Great Emperor.

Lan Xun, however, wore a strange expression.

Because those words... were exactly what her father had said before.

The old man seemed to realize his words were too shocking, so he quickly changed the subject. "I don't have the ability to reseal the Divine Spirit's Spirit Essence."

Yang Kai’s face darkened at those words, and he snapped angrily, “If you don’t have the ability, then why act so confident? Are you just toying with me?”

The old man grinned. "I may not have the ability, but someone else can."

"Who?" Yang Kai frowned, suddenly glancing around before finally fixing his gaze on Yao Si.

If anyone here could reseal the Divine Spirit's Spirit Essence, it would be one of the two Great Emperor's children present, who shared Mo Xiaoqi's status. Lan Xun definitely couldn't do it, but maybe Yao Si could.

Sensing Yang Kai's gaze, Yao Si said coolly, "Killing people is my specialty, not saving them. Want to give it a try?"

Yang Kai glared at him, then turned back to the old man. "Stop dawdling and hurry up, find someone to help already."

The old man chuckled. "Young people are always impatient. Don't worry, the seal still needs a bit more time before it's fully undone. After all, this is the first time it's being released. The Divine Spirit's Spirit Essence needs to merge with the girl for a while before it can move freely."

Seeing Yang Kai’s face grow darker and darker, the old man finally stopped rambling. He lifted his head, his expression turning solemn as he looked at someone in the crowd. Beckoning with his hand, he called out, “You there, young lady, come over here and give this old man a hand.”

Following his gesture, everyone turned to look. Over there, a young girl stood pale-faced, her Origin Qi fluctuating wildly. No one knew what was wrong with her.

Zhang Ruoxi!

Yang Kai turned his head in astonishment, his expression growing extremely strange.

He never would have thought that the person the old man was talking about was actually Zhang Ruoxi!

Come to think of it, ever since Mo Xiaoqi's strange change, Zhang Ruoxi had also seemed a bit off. But because the Sacred Soul Seal was such a big deal, Yang Kai hadn't had time to check on her carefully. He had only secretly told Liu Yan to keep an eye on her and report anything unusual.

Now, the old man was clearly beckoning Zhang Ruoxi over to help.

What was this old man up to? Yang Kai was completely confused.
