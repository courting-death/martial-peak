## Chapter 801 — External and Internal Troubles

If An Ling'er had begged him to stay when she discovered him, Yang Kai might have left without hesitation.

But she let him go!

Clearly she was thinking of him. If An Ling'er could think for his sake, Yang Kai could not simply walk away.

Something major must have happened within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Seeing Yang Kai choose to remain, An Ling'er was especially glad and hurriedly recounted everything that had happened since he entered the Sacred Tomb.

Only then did Yang Kai learn he had spent a full nine months inside the Sacred Tomb.

The first half year passed without incident.

But around half a year later the protective formations arrayed around the Nine Peaks suddenly failed, leaving all the elders and guardians of the Sacred Land unprepared.

No matter how they searched, they could not discover the cause, much less repair or restart the arrays.

Just when everyone was at a loss, Saintess Nan, who had sensed the arrays' collapse, charged into the Sacred Land.

Together they repelled Saintess Nan, but the Sacred Land's foundation was shattered in many places, and countless disciples were killed or injured in the battle.

To make matters worse, external enemies invaded at the same time.

"External enemies?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"Yes. Though our Sacred Land has been powerful in recent years, which power has no enemies? While the old Saint Lord lived he could keep them in check, but he died nearly two years ago and no new Saint Lord has taken the seat. They saw an opportunity. Our Nine Peaks are an excellent place to cultivate—those factions covet it."

"Isn't this just kicking someone when they're down?" Yang Kai sneered softly.

"Indeed," An Ling'er nodded, her expression dim. "It's not all their fault; the old Saint Lord was harsh in his methods, and they resented him..."

"That might be forgiven, but..." Yu Ying interjected, her brows narrowing, "Saintess Nan's recent rampage has enraged the populace. Those factions seized the chance to gather many experts and demanded we give an explanation. Some of those experts suffered losses because of Saintess Nan, or their kin were killed by her—now they regard our Sacred Land as an enemy to be crushed."

"Rain falls on a leaky roof, and a boat that's late meets the headwind," Yang Kai murmured, realizing why the Nine Heavens Sacred Land lay in such ruin.

The arrays failed about half a year ago, right when he obtained the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring.

Could it be related? Yang Kai wondered, though he dared not be certain.

"Two weeks ago they came again, clamoring for us to hand over Saintess Nan. But since that battle six months ago Saintess Nan fled severely wounded and her whereabouts are unknown—how could we produce her? The Grand Elder tried to reason with them to no avail. Those covetous factions fanned the flames and fighting broke out. Both sides suffered casualties and the hatred deepened. It seems irreconcilable now..." An Ling'er sighed.

"Which factions came to stir trouble?" Yang Kai asked, frowning.

"Leading them were three nearby powers: Poxuan Prefecture, War Soul Hall, and Youming Sect!" Yu Ying's face showed disgust and hatred. "Those three are the culprits. If it were only one, even if our Sacred Land lost much Yuan Qi, we wouldn't care. But they gathered many other sects and families' formidable figures. After that battle, our Sacred Land was nearly at odds with half the world!"

"The situation is that dire?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

But remembering Saintess Nan's deeds outside, it made sense.

Saintess Nan had been killing wherever she went, leaving corpses in her wake. Her deeds created enormous hidden dangers for the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. She, a Second Stage of the Saint Realm cultivator, was profoundly powerful and possessed great Divine Arts; only Third Stage of the Saint Realm experts could confront her, and such masters were exceedingly rare.

Even Chu Lingxiao of Tianxiao Sect might not be at that level, Yang Kai thought.

"Far worse than you imagine!" Yu Ying said coldly. "Those three powers covet not only the Nine Peaks' foundation—they covet Ling'er herself!"

She glanced meaningfully at An Ling'er.

Yang Kai's eyes flashed as he grasped their intent: they wanted to arrange marriages between their sects' disciples and the Saintess to obtain the Saint Lord's legacy.

Securing such a heritage would skyrocket one's status—something decades or centuries of effort could never buy.

"Exactly!" Yu Ying nodded heavily. "When they retreated two weeks ago they threatened to raze the Nine Peaks within a month if we didn't hand over Saintess Nan. That night the Grand Elder received a secret letter saying if we couldn't produce the previous Saintess, offering this generation's Saintess instead would suffice!"

"What audacity..." Yang Kai clicked his tongue, astonished at their brazenness. "So you'll just sit and await your doom?"

Yu Ying's eyes dimmed. "What can we do? There's nowhere for us to go. In half a month the Grand Elder hopes to persuade those drawn-in powers to withdraw. If it comes down to only those three, we may weather it; once our Sacred Land recovers we'll settle the score."

"Your old Saint Lord did them no favors," Yang Kai said slowly, shaking his head. "Why not treat them better in life? No wonder they now stir trouble."

"Which side are you on?" Yu Ying shot him an irritated glare.

"I'm just being honest," Yang Kai shrugged.

"While the old Saint Lord lived he was harsh and demanded tributes of cultivation resources each year, but under his protection those three powers flourished in peace," An Ling'er explained. "Now they repay kindness with ingratitude—they're turncoats."

"How did your old Saint Lord protect them?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

"Did I not tell you? Our Sacred Land sits on the edge of Human Territory. Cross those towering mountains and beyond lie the Beast Sea Forests—the domain of the yao. Had the old Saint Lord not held this place, the Yao's Great Lord long ago would have led forces to seize these lands."

"The yao?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "So that side is the Yao Realm?"

"Yes."

"Then why didn't they take this chance to attack?" Yang Kai asked.

With the old Saint Lord's fall the yao should have moved. Human, yao, and demon tribes bore mutual hatred; any would have seized such an opportunity. Yang Kai sensed there must be hidden reasons—secrets unknown to most.

An Ling'er looked to Yu Ying for confirmation. Yu Ying hesitated, expression complex, then nodded slightly.

"It seems the old Saint Lord had some rapport with the Yao Lord... they did not attack for that reason," An Ling'er murmured.

"Oh?" Yang Kai smiled wryly and scoffed, "So the yao are more humane, then... Their lord must be formidable."

"We've never met him, but he should be strong," Yu Ying agreed.

"That's the gist of it," An Ling'er finished, staring at Yang Kai as if waiting for his response. Yu Ying watched him anxiously, fearing he might abandon them upon learning of the disaster.

If so, Yu Ying would be truly undone.

Having passed the Sacred Tomb's trial and returned safely, Yang Kai was now effectively equal to the Sacred Land's lord. His presence would steady the disciples and ease the handling of affairs.

With two women staring at him, Yang Kai felt helpless and asked in a low voice, "Where is Xu Hui?"

At his question both An Ling'er and Yu Ying brightened; Yu Ying hurriedly said, "I'll take you to him!" and led the way smiling.

Yang Kai and An Ling'er followed.

"Are you... going to be the Sacred Land's lord?" An Ling'er asked softly.

"I didn't say that—don't misunderstand. But if I can help now, I will. I can't promise I'll solve this catastrophe, only that I'll do my best. If the Sacred Land falls, at least I won't be to blame."

"That's enough," An Ling'er beamed. "You're very good—we are friends, right?"

"Yes." Yang Kai smiled wickedly. "So don't fall in love with me—if you do, I'll leave and we won't even be friends."

"Don't be so full of yourself!" An Ling'er blushed and punched him playfully, claiming, "You aren't my type despite being decent."

"What is your type?" Yang Kai asked, surprised.

"Older than me, tall and mighty, someone who knows how to care for others..." An Ling'er drifted into reverie, eyes soft with sweetness.

"You have no taste!" Yang Kai scoffed, arrogantly amused, which made An Ling'er giggle.

The path was littered with ruins, bloodstains, and the marks of battle.

Disciples of the Sacred Land who saw Yu Ying and An Ling'er saluted; when they noticed Yang Kai walking beside An Ling'er they were dumbfounded and could scarcely believe their eyes.

Ahead, Xu Hui was organizing people busily. Yu Ying called out cheerfully; Xu Hui turned to reply, but his eyes suddenly bulged as if he had seen a ghost—he gaped, unable to speak.
