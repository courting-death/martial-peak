## Chapter 2583 — Four Spirits Gather

At this moment, Ruoxi was hiding atop the crown of a large tree, doing her best to suppress her presence.

Although her strength was decent now, she absolutely did not want to cause trouble in a place like this. Naturally, she focused on hiding, quietly waiting for Yang Kai to arrive. As long as Sir arrived and a conflict broke out with the yao, she would rush out to lend him a hand. Surely, Sir would not blame her then.

She truly only wanted to help a little, and did not wish to be immediately stashed away in the Small Xuan Realm by Yang Kai to wait in boredom whenever danger appeared. That would make her feel useless.

Patrol squads of little yao passed nearby, but none discovered Zhang Ruoxi’s whereabouts. This made her secretly rejoice and gave her much more confidence.

It was her first time doing something so dangerous, so she was naturally extremely nervous. Fortunately, after years of following Yang Kai across the world, she had gained plenty of experience. Even though she was tense, she could barely maintain her composure.

Time slowly passed.

Another patrol squad of yao approached from ahead. These yao were extremely vigilant, scanning all around as if searching for something suspicious. As the group passed beneath the tree and was about to move away, one yao suddenly stopped, his nostrils twitching as he sniffed the air.

“What’s wrong?” Another yao looked at him, asking suspiciously.

The yao didn’t answer, sniffed for a while longer, then suddenly raised his brows and said, “There’s a human scent!”

Hearing this, Ruoxi’s face changed dramatically. She knew things had gone bad—she must have exposed herself. If this group of yao confirmed her location, she would have no chance to escape.

Now she could only hope the yao was merely suspicious and not certain. If so, maybe she could still avoid disaster.

But that hope quickly vanished. After sniffing a bit more, the yao suddenly looked up toward the crown of the tree.

Though thick leaves blocked their sight, Zhang Ruoxi’s heart still pounded fiercely, knowing she could no longer hide here.

Just as she resolved to flee, a dirty head suddenly appeared beside her, hair in disarray, hanging upside down in front of her, grinning widely.

Ruoxi was startled, nearly crying out, but after seeing who this filthy person was, she quickly covered her mouth, not daring to make a sound, only staring wide-eyed at the dirty face.

A hand reached for Zhang Ruoxi, grabbed her, and in the next instant, their figures flickered and vanished like ghosts.

Swish—

A yao leapt onto the tree crown, looked around for a while, but found nothing, scratching his head in confusion.

“What’s up there?” a yao waiting below called out.

“Nothing at all,” the observing yao replied, jumping down and laughing awkwardly. “Maybe it was just my imagination.”

The group of yao looked at him with displeasure, blaming him for being overly nervous, then continued onward.

Atop the crown of another large tree, Zhang Ruoxi watched the group of yao gradually move away. She finally let out a heavy breath, her chest heaving violently. In that moment, her heart nearly leapt out of her chest—she almost thought she was going to die. Thankfully, someone had intervened at the critical moment.

She quickly turned her head to look beside her.

Right next to her, the Third Disciple of the Ice Heart Valley was grinning foolishly at her. As Ruoxi looked closer, she realized this woman must have an absolutely stunning face, but her mind was damaged, and she neglected her appearance, living in the ancient land for years. Her beauty was completely hidden beneath layers of grime, making one sigh in pity.

“...Senior, why are you here?” Ruoxi didn’t know this person’s name—neither did Yang Kai—so she could only address her vaguely.

The Third Disciple giggled, seemingly not understanding Ruoxi’s question, and had no intention of answering. Instead, she kept sniffing like the yao, her dirty nose nearly touching Ruoxi, apparently finding Ruoxi’s scent pleasant, showing a look of intoxication as she sniffed.

Ruoxi felt uncomfortable being sniffed, her body itching. She quickly raised her hand to block the Third Disciple’s advances, saying, “Senior, stop messing around, or the yao will notice us.”

The Third Disciple was pushed away, immediately pouting in displeasure.

Seeing her like this, Ruoxi felt a bit sorry. Such a beautiful woman, with powerful Second Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivation, would be admired by countless men outside, like a celestial maiden. Yet now she was reduced to such a state. Ruoxi wondered if her master, Senior Bing Yun, would feel heartache if she knew.

“Alright, Senior, I have things to do. Be good!” Zhang Ruoxi took the Third Disciple’s dirty hands, showing no disgust, gently patting them and softly said, “I’m waiting here for Sir. You know, the one who gave you fruit last time. Sir has been looking for you. Don’t run off, let’s wait here together for him, okay?”

The Third Disciple stared at Zhang Ruoxi for a moment, then suddenly nodded vigorously.

Ruoxi smiled, “You can understand me?”

The Third Disciple pounced, hugging Ruoxi tightly, burying her head in Ruoxi’s ample chest, wriggling about with abandon...

“Senior... I can’t breathe...” Ruoxi’s face flushed, a strange feeling in her chest making her whole body weak. The force holding her was so strong she could barely breathe, and her strength was no match for the Third Disciple. She wanted to break free but couldn’t.

...

Ten li outside the Blood Gate, just as Mu Na had said earlier, after the Blood Gate mutated, the mysterious force nearby seemed to vanish. Normally, no one could approach the Blood Gate— even the strongest Yao King would be dissolved by the mysterious power, dying instantly. But now, weak yao kept pouring in from all directions, their eyes red, as if they’d lost their minds, rushing toward the Blood Gate, desperate to enter.

Bloodline attraction!

Xie Wuwei had mentioned this before. After the Blood Gate mutated, the aura of the Divine Spirit Palace’s Divine Spirit Origins leaked out, which was a huge temptation for any Ancient Land creature. The weaker yao were lured in, gradually losing their reason, recklessly charging toward the Blood Gate.

But these yao were doomed to never get within ten li.

Because at this moment, eight figures were constantly patrolling around the Blood Gate. Whenever they found a yao trying to approach, they would kill without hesitation.

These eight yao were the left and right Saint Envoys under the Four Great Saint Venerables.

For a time, outside the Blood Gate, corpses littered the ground, blood filled the air, and in just a few days, countless Ancient Land creatures had died at the hands of these eight envoys. Yet, the endless rush of yao could not be stopped.

Fifty li further away, atop a high peak, stood a stone pavilion. Inside, four figures sat or stood, while outside, some yao guarded respectfully, their gazes full of awe whenever they looked at the four.

These four figures were the Four Great Saint Venerables of the Wild Ancient Land.

The Blood Gate’s mutation was a major event. Even they had to personally come to investigate, sitting nearby to guard against any mishaps.

On the left sat a middle-aged man in a purple brocade robe and ornate crown, looking no different from an ordinary human. Yet his face radiated authority, his eyes like lightning, making anyone who met his gaze feel a chill. This was the Eastern Saint Venerable, Fan Wu.

On the right was a figure resembling a Stone Spirit, with a body like rock, skin like stone armor. But unlike the gentle Stone Spirits, this figure was fierce, covered in stone spikes, even his face was savage, a murderous aura swirling around him, his eyes burning like flames, as if ready to devour anyone.

The Northern Saint Venerable, Shi Huo!

In the Star Realm, the other three territories might not know Shi Huo’s name, but for martial artists of the Eastern Territory, his name was legendary.

Three thousand years ago, the top sect in the Eastern Territory, Black Tortoise Sect, was wiped out by Shi Huo. Nearly all its disciples were slaughtered. After the massacre, Great Emperor Youhun was enraged and personally tried to capture Shi Huo, but he escaped into the Wild Ancient Land.

To escape even the Great Emperor’s personal attack showed just how strong Shi Huo was.

In Fenglin City, Qin Chaoyang’s ancestors were disciples of the Black Tortoise Sect. The Imperial Treasure, Myriad Sword, was their ancestral sword. The Black Tortoise Seven-Segment Array Qin Chaoyang taught Yang Kai was also a secret technique of the sect.

After the Black Tortoise Sect was destroyed, the Qin Family ancestors fled to the Southern Territory, settling in Fenglin City. Not long after, they died from severe injuries and over generations, the family declined.

In the center of the stone pavilion, a stone table held a pot of fragrant tea, steam rising.

A beautiful woman sat at the table, skin like snow, features exquisite, figure alluring, eyes charming, long black hair cascading down her back to her shapely hips. Her beauty was unmatched. She reached out with slender hands, poured herself a cup of tea, and quietly savored it.

The Southern Saint Venerable, Luan Feng!

If one didn’t know her background, no one would believe that such a seductive beauty was actually a top Divine Spirit with ancient lineage. Anyone who dared provoke her had already been burned to ashes by the World-Ending Black Flame.

The last figure had a sinister gaze, clearly not someone to be trifled with. He sat on a stone stool opposite Luan Feng, unmoving like a fossil, his eyes always drifting to Luan Feng’s alluring figure, but not daring to be too blatant, acting somewhat sneaky.

Luan Feng sipped her tea, lips parted slightly, and said coldly, “Cang Gou, keep staring and I’ll dig your eyes out!”

The man called Cang Gou showed a hint of fear, but could only smile awkwardly, “Madam Feng, must you keep me at arm’s length? Don’t you know how much this Lord cares for you?”

Luan Feng didn’t even lift her eyes, her voice still indifferent, “All I know is, you’re very annoying.”
