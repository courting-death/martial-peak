## Chapter 2309 — So It Was You Behind This

Everyone stared wide-eyed at the point where the energies converged, wanting to see how Yang Kai would resolve such danger. To their great disappointment, Yang Kai did not emerge; not even a hint of movement could be seen.

“Young Master Yang!” Ye Qinghan’s expression changed dramatically as she cried out.

Given Yang Kai’s cultivation at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, there was simply no way he could withstand such a fierce attack. She felt he was most likely doomed.

Over there, Luo Jin sneered, his face full of mockery.

After a short while the energy dissipated, and where Yang Kai had been standing a huge pit remained—there was no sign of him at all.

“Where is he? Where did he go?”

“Dead, right? Was he blasted into ashes like Cheng Fei?”

“Makes sense. This brat is just here to make people laugh, all thunder and no rain!”

“With so many martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion attacking at once, even someone at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm would surely die. How could this young man possibly withstand it? He must be dead with not even a corpse left.”

Seeing this, everyone began to discuss in hushed tones. Some lamented Yang Kai’s untimely death, some mocked his overconfidence, and others immediately flattered Luo Jin, showering him with endless praise.

Luo Jin wore a faint smile, but deep down a vague unease grew, leaving him restless.

Chai Hu’s face was ashen, and he didn’t recover for quite a while.

At the table on the other side, Du Xian’s face was also pale as he kept swallowing nervously, not coming back to his senses for a long time. After a while, he finally snapped out of it and said in a low voice, “We need to leave quickly. If we don’t go now, it’ll be too late.”

Yang Kai was already dead. Although he had nothing to do with the Thousand Leaves Sect, he had been sitting at their table. People might misunderstand, and Luo Jin could take the opportunity to make things difficult for the sect and detain them.

If Luo Jin really did that, he would have a legitimate reason; no one would blame him.

Thinking of this, Du Xian panicked, and as he spoke, he hurriedly grabbed Ye Qinghan, intending to sneak away while everyone’s attention was elsewhere.

Who would have thought that Ye Qinghan wouldn’t move at all, her beautiful eyes merely sweeping the void?

“Ye'er, what are you doing?” Du Xian was anxious.

Ye Qinghan said, “Young Master Yang won’t die. He can’t be killed so easily.”

Du Xian didn’t know where her confidence came from. He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “He’s already dead and gone. What are you still looking for?”

Ye Qinghan said, “I’ve seen Young Master Yang’s abilities. How could he die just like that?”

After all, Yang Kai had promised her to return to the Thousand Leaves Sect together to repair the Space Array. This concerned the future rise and fall of the Thousand Leaves Sect, so how could Ye Qinghan not care? As long as she hadn’t seen Yang Kai’s corpse, she absolutely refused to believe he was dead.

“So what if he’s strong? Two fists can’t beat four hands, Ye'er!” Du Xian tried to persuade her earnestly.

“I believe in him!” Ye Qinghan bit her red lips and continued searching the void. Suddenly, as if she had discovered something, she stared intently in one direction and gasped, but quickly covered her mouth with her hand.

Du Xian and the others looked surprised and followed her gaze. Over there stood a strong expert from the City Lord’s mansion, apparently at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, one of those who had just attacked Yang Kai.

But at that moment, a faint shadow eerily appeared behind the man, gradually solidifying into Yang Kai’s form.

“This…” Du Xian nearly popped his eyes out, his voice trembling, “He’s really… not dead?”

His heart trembled. Just how strong must one be to escape such an attack unnoticed? Not only was he alive, but he was completely unscathed, not even a wrinkle on his clothes.

In the hall, countless Divine Senses overlapped and covered everything. The several experts at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm seemed to have never let down their guard. As soon as Yang Kai appeared, they immediately noticed, and several pairs of eyes turned to him at once.

When Luo Jin saw Yang Kai’s figure, his expression changed dramatically and he shouted, “Brat, what are you trying to do?”

Yang Kai poked his head out from behind the Second Stage expert, grinned at Luo Jin, and made a slight slicing motion with his hand. A hidden wave of space power surged out and quickly vanished.

After doing this, he finally spoke, “I said, if anyone dares to attack me again, don’t blame me for being rude!”

As soon as he spoke, Luo Jin inexplicably shivered, a deep sense of unease spreading in his heart.

At that moment, the Second Stage expert in front of Yang Kai suddenly toppled forward. Before he even hit the ground, blood spurted from his neck and his head flew high into the air.

Cries of alarm erupted from all directions. Countless people stared at Yang Kai in terror, retreating again and again to put distance between themselves and him.

The man who had just died was a famous expert in Tianhe City, always Luo Jin’s right-hand man, helping him manage the city as a deputy city lord.

Yet such an expert was killed by Yang Kai without a sound! Judging from his bewildered eyes before death, it seemed he hadn’t even realized what had happened.

Everyone was shocked. Just how powerful was this young man to kill a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert so stealthily? Even the victim hadn’t noticed a thing.

Yang Kai looked at Luo Jin and said calmly, “I’m sorry to have blood spilled on the City Lord’s joyous day, so I hope no one else will try to stop me!”

With that, he once again walked toward the bride, who had been standing motionless the whole time.

As he passed, everyone unconsciously parted to make way for him, and the martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion all retreated with ugly expressions, not daring to step forward.

Luo Jin’s face was as dark as water as he stared at Yang Kai’s back, his eyes filled with murderous intent.

This young man named Yang Kai had caused such a scene at today’s grand ceremony, greatly damaging his prestige. If he couldn’t restore his reputation, how could he stand in Tianhe City in the future?

But even several Second Stage experts together couldn’t do anything to him. Perhaps only he himself could subdue him now.

With this thought, Luo Jin glanced inconspicuously at a certain spot in the crowd.

Over there, Yang Kai had already strode up to the bride, his face showing a mix of complexity and nervousness. He reached out to grab the red bridal veil and said, “Forgive me!”

All the guests stared wide-eyed, partly to see how things would develop, and partly out of curiosity about the bride’s appearance.

Yang Kai had caused such a commotion just to see what the bride looked like, even offending the City Lord’s mansion and killing a deputy city lord. Now, even those who hadn’t been curious about the bride’s looks were interested.

For a moment, under everyone’s gaze, the hall was silent, so quiet that a pin drop could be heard. It seemed everyone was holding their breath, waiting for that crucial moment.

Just as Yang Kai’s hand was about to touch the red veil, the bride suddenly reached out with a jade-like hand and grabbed his arm. At the same time, her delicate body surged with Yao Qi, and she struck fiercely at Yang Kai’s chest. The energy in her palm was overwhelming, containing immense power.

“Watch out!” Chai Hu shouted. He had just suffered a great loss at the bride’s hands earlier; if he hadn’t had a hostage, he wouldn’t have been captured so easily.

Seeing this sudden change, Ye Qinghan also cried out in alarm.

That palm strike was extremely powerful. Yang Kai, having concerns, didn’t dare to resist for fear of hurting the bride, so he let her palm land on his chest. He felt as if struck by lightning, was sent flying backward, and blood trickled from the corner of his mouth as his internal organs churned.

At that moment, Luo Jin silently appeared behind Yang Kai, suddenly producing a Secret Treasure shaped like a jade scepter and struck Yang Kai hard with it, sneering, “This Lord will send you on your way!”

As he spoke, the jade scepter struck Yang Kai. The scepter shone brightly, releasing mysterious power that tore open a black hole in the void, swallowing Yang Kai’s body.

In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai was torn to pieces.

Luo Jin, having succeeded, laughed loudly, “This is the fate of defying this Lord!”

All the guests were silent with fear, staring at the jade scepter in Luo Jin’s hand, their faces full of dread. It seemed this Secret Treasure was extremely powerful.

But in the next moment Luo Jin’s smile froze; he suddenly realized the Yang Kai who had been smashed to pieces had not bled. Instead, the body twisted and faded away like smoke.

"Afterimage!" Luo Jin’s face changed dramatically. He never expected such a sure sneak attack to fail.

"So it was you behind this!" Yang Kai's voice rang out from the crowd, startling the nearby guests into retreat. When they looked back, they saw Yang Kai gripping a middle-aged man by the neck, sneering coldly.

The crowd didn’t seem to recognize this middle-aged man, but seeing his misfortune, they couldn’t help but show sympathy, not knowing why Yang Kai had targeted him.

This man also had the cultivation of the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. He was quite strong, but after witnessing Yang Kai kill the deputy city lord, how could he dare resist? His body trembled as he looked at Yang Kai in fear and said, “Young Brother, let’s talk this out. What are you doing?”

Yang Kai squeezed his neck, making it creak, and sneered, “Stop pretending. Tell me, how did you control the bride?”

At these words, the man’s face changed dramatically, his eyes flustered as he tried to cover up, “You… I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“You know exactly what I mean. I’ll give you ten breaths to obediently undo that secret technique, or you’ll never get the chance!”

The man panicked and looked to Luo Jin for help.

Meanwhile, the despairing Chai Hu seemed to realize something upon hearing this. He struggled to get up and looked at Yang Kai, asking, “Friend, what do you mean by that…”
