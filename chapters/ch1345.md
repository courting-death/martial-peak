## Chapter 1345 — Heaven and Earth Spirit

Once the Saint King Realm juniors had taken a careful look, each of them showed astonishment; the garments on those ice-carved figures clearly resembled the attire of several Sects currently on Dark Star. Though there were differences, a closer inspection revealed commonalities.

For example, one man had a small “Lei” character embroidered on the chest of his robes, identical to the attire worn by the present-day Leitai Sect.

Another bore a "Battle" character on his cuff, marking him likely a member of the Battle Sky Alliance in life.

Others came from Liuli Sect, Li Huo Sect, and Wanshou Mountain in abundance; Fei Zhi Tu even discovered a predecessor from Yingyue Hall among them.

Every warrior frozen here was a master of superb cultivation; to have penetrated this place they must have been greatly blessed, each possessing peerless methods, yet all had met their end here, stirring sighs of regret.

"Now is not the time to gawk at these," Yang Kai said, brow knit, noticing how Fei Zhi Tu and the others' gazes were fixated on the Spatial Rings worn by the fallen elders, and he warned calmly, "They were frozen here for a reason; this place may truly harbor great danger. Shouldn't we hurry through?"

At Yang Kai's words, Fei Zhi Tu and the others' expressions tightened.

When they first discovered the ice sculptures, amid their lament they had noticed the Spatial Rings. Since these were once famed Lords, the Spatial Rings surely contained many valuable things.

Everyone was greedy by nature, and while coveting those rings they had all neglected to wonder why the warriors had been frozen here until Yang Kai spoke.

Fei Zhi Tu suddenly broke out in a cold sweat and quickly nodded, "Right! Let's leave at once!"

Ning Xiangchen and the others reluctantly withdrew their lingering looks and followed close behind Fei Zhi Tu and Yang Kai.

But they had not gone more than a hundred zhang before Yang Kai suddenly barked, "Who goes there!"

As his voice fell, a golden thread shot forth at a finger's snap and tore toward the void. A flash of white light flickered there; a blurred silhouette swayed in their sight and vanished. At the same moment, a sheet of bitter cold swept toward them, colliding with the defensive barrier formed by the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird with a crackling hiss.

In the blink of an eye, the first layer of protection laid by the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird had a hole torn through it by that chill, but the Li Fire Shield fortunately sprang into effect and blocked the remaining cold.

Even so, Fei Zhi Tu's face drained of color; that residual chill had already nullified much of the Li Fire Shield's potency and nearly shattered it.

"What is that?" Ning Xiangchen's face darkened as he turned to look around.

The others likewise grew pale. Regardless of how strong the Fire Bird's protection was, the Li Fire Shield treasure possessed by the Hall Master of Yingyue Hall was itself an item meant to suppress freezing cold; yet upon contact with that residual chill it had nearly been undone—one could imagine the true might of that cold.

Had it not been for these two layers of defense, the brief encounter just now would likely have sent them to the same fate as those predecessors.

There was indeed some other peril here!

Yang Kai's face was especially grim, for in that fleeting contact he had found his Fire Bird Artifact Spirit somewhat outmatched—this surprised and shocked him greatly.

The Artifact Spirit was formed after being scorched by the Earth-Lung Fire Vein for tens of thousands of years; if even it was no match, then what could they be up against?

Luckily, the fleeting white flash had not completely hidden its form; after the missed strike it revealed its true appearance and hovered not far off.

At sight of it, everyone gaped.

The thing presented itself in the shape of a white rabbit, but it was fat and massive—three times the size of an ordinary white rabbit—its fur pure and immaculate like carved jade, yet its two eyes were blood-red, emitting a savage, cruel light.

"A Spiritual Qi manifestation!"

"A Heaven and Earth Spirit!"

Several Origin Returning Realm experts including Fei Zhi Tu cried out in astonishment.

With their eyesight they could immediately discern that this white rabbit was not flesh and blood but, like the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, a being formed of Spiritual Qi with awakened intelligence.

Such beings are Heaven and Earth Spirits!

Artifact Spirits can be considered a kind of Heaven and Earth Spirit, though not entirely—the birth of an Artifact Spirit relies on an artificing furnace as its vessel; should that furnace be destroyed, the Artifact Spirit may be wiped out.

But this blood-eyed white rabbit was a true Heaven and Earth Spirit in the fullest sense. It had no birth vessel; it had simply coalesced from the thick icy energies here and awakened its own intelligence.

Heaven and Earth Spirits are exceedingly rare in number, yet their value is incalculable.

If a cultivator of the same attribute obtains such a Heaven and Earth Spirit and refines or even absorbs it, their strength can increase dramatically without harm, bypassing years of toil.

But a Heaven and Earth Spirit's power is unpredictable; so even if one discovered such a spirit, capture is not guaranteed—one might instead be slain by it.

The group had long suspected that in this harsh cold, after years of accumulation some treasures might be born here, but none expected that such an oddity as a Heaven and Earth Spirit would be formed.

For a time, every face displayed a complex mixture of fear, excitement, and panic.

They now understood why those predecessors had been frozen into ice sculptures: it had to be the work of this Heaven and Earth Spirit, lying hidden in the cold and launching sudden ambushes. Even a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert might not evade it; struck by its means, a warrior's end would be grim.

If Yang Kai had not sensed a warning from his Fire Bird Artifact Spirit, they certainly would not have noticed; Fire Bird and this white rabbit Heaven and Earth Spirit were of opposing attributes, so when it attacked the Fire Bird had detected it.

No wonder the Artifact Spirit seemed outmatched—so it was a Heaven and Earth Spirit! Yang Kai's expression eased a little.

At this moment the white rabbit Heaven and Earth Spirit watched them with covetous eyes and ill intent; none dared make a rash move.

Fei Zhi Tu's face twitched. "This is a big problem. Do any of you have a good way to scare it off?"

He no longer hoped to defeat or capture the spirit—only to drive it away so they could safely pass along the Ice Path. Before such an unpredictable Heaven and Earth Spirit, even the eight of them together might not prevail; the spirit remained still partly because the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit and the Li Fire Shield had some restraining effect.

But the place was bitter cold; if things dragged on until the Artifact Spirit and the Li Fire Shield were exhausted, they would be unable to survive even without the rabbit moving further.

Upon hearing this, everyone shook their heads sourly.

Ning Xiangchen's face went iron-gray as he murmured, "I hear Heaven and Earth Spirits most love to devour the life force of living creatures to grow themselves; it seems that's why those predecessors met such a cruel fate."

"Devour life force?" The Saint King Realm juniors paled—clearly none had heard of this secret before.

Yang Kai, however, wore a strange expression as he schemed inwardly; if this rabbit did indeed feed on life force, he might have a way to lure it away.

After all, the Golden Blood in his veins contained surging vitality and an unimaginable force of Qi and blood; to give up a single drop should be enough to draw the spirit. But the rabbit's speed was tremendous, and the end of the Ice Path was unknown. If it drank one drop of Golden Blood and they hadn't yet left, it would surely return to pursue them—he might have to sacrifice a second drop, a third, perhaps more.

Not worth it! Yang Kai shook his head inside and resolved to keep that method as a last resort; only if all else failed would he use Golden Blood to attract its attention.

"If we can't scare it off, then we'll have to force our way through!" Fei Zhi Tu forced a bitter smile. "We must go now before things change. Everyone be careful."

"Understood!" they all replied, each producing protective Secret Treasures and taking up guard.

Lian Guang said nothing. He suddenly threw out a python-shaped puppet; after inputting Saint Yuan it transformed into a giant serpent as thick as a water bucket and more than ten zhang long. Fierce in aspect, armored in heavy scales, it gave off energy fluctuations not weaker than a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

"Go!" Lian Guang uttered a low shout and the giant serpent immediately slithered ahead, clearly meant to draw the rabbit's attention.

Generally speaking, rabbits have an instinctive fear of serpents; though whether this Heaven and Earth Spirit shared that instinct was unknown, Lian Guang at least held out a slim hope.

Seeing this, a look of satisfaction flashed across Fei Zhi Tu's face as he led the others to follow the giant serpent slowly onward.

Their movements were careful and their pace slow—none dared make sudden motions lest they provoke the white rabbit.

The giant serpent puppet kept flicking its tongue in and out, swaying its head from side to side. It looked incomparably fierce and majestic, truly broadening Yang Kai’s horizons.

The Lian family's art of forging and commanding puppets clearly had its secrets; the giant serpent looked utterly lifelike, save for its lack of true vitality.

The white rabbit's blood-red eyes flashed a trace of brilliance, revealing considerable intelligence; it stared at the giant serpent a moment, then suddenly shifted and transformed into the form of a massive eagle.

A clear, piercing cry sounded; in the next moment the great eagle swooped and landed on the serpent's head, opening its beak to spew a cloud of white mist.

Everyone's expressions changed—none had expected it to understand transformation.

Lian Guang was especially stunned. Forming a hand sign, the giant serpent reared up, jaws agape, and a crimson beam burst from its mouth with terrifying force.

But when that crimson beam touched the white mist it froze instantly. After the mist enveloped the serpent, ice formed on its body at a speed visible to the naked eye with cracking sounds.
