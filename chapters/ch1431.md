## Chapter 1431 — Rely on the Mountain to Live off the Mountain

Worried he might have overstepped, Mo Yu immediately added, “Of course, if you, Yang Kai, find it difficult, then just take it that this old man never said anything.”

“What’s there to feel awkward about.” Yang Kai shook his head slowly, appearing unconcerned. “Since Senior Mo is the master of Miss Shen and Miss Lü Ying, I naturally wouldn’t refuse. Not to mention merely departing from here to enter the Imperial Garden, Senior Mo is welcome to linger in my Lingxiao Sect for a while if he wishes.”

At these words, both Shen Shitao and Lü Ying, who had been standing behind Mo Yu, brightened visibly; their beautiful eyes glittered with a different radiance as they looked at Yang Kai with gratitude.

Mo Yu wore a delighted expression as well, clearly not expecting Yang Kai to agree so easily. He had been considering whether, if Yang Kai refused, he should have Shen Shitao and Lü Ying step forward to plead, but it turned out such trouble wasn’t needed at all.

Mo Yu had a deep appreciation for Yang Kai’s generosity; after all, matters like this aren’t decided lightly. For someone to agree at once most likely did so out of consideration for Shen Shitao and Lü Ying’s faces.

These two disciples of his might not have top-tier aptitude, but their luck was good—they’d made an excellent friend. Mo Yu felt deeply gratified in his old heart and thanked Yang Kai repeatedly. As for Yang Kai’s suggestion that he stay at Lingxiao Sect a while longer, he certainly didn’t take it seriously; that was clearly just polite talk. Having lived long and seen much, how could he not tell?

The Lingxiao Sect had only just been founded, and there were surely countless matters awaiting attention. For him to receive Yang Kai’s promise was already a great blessing—how could he have the gall to stay and impose further?

“Mm, Elder Qian, the people of Yingyue Hall can also enter the Imperial Garden from my Lingxiao Sect!” Yang Kai turned to Qian Tong.

“In that case, I thank you in advance.” Qian Tong chuckled without much formality. Yang Kai’s willingness to let Qiantian Sect enter the Imperial Garden from here naturally wouldn’t exclude his Yingyue Hall—Qian Tong understood that well.

“Miss Daiyuan, if you’re willing, you can be included as well.” Yang Kai glanced toward Daiyuan at the rear. “But the others from Liuli Sect can forget it.”

Yang Kai was generous to friends but not a pushover; allowing those present to enter the Imperial Garden from Lingxiao Sect was due to personal ties and didn’t mean the rest of Liuli Sect had the same privilege. He had no dealings with the others of Liuli Sect, and even had many grievances with Yin Sudie.

Daiyuan’s expression dimmed and she smiled bitterly. “Daiyuan thanks Junior Brother Yang for his kindness, but… I probably don’t have a chance to enter the Imperial Garden.”

Yang Kai frowned, but quickly realized why she would say that. Within Liuli Sect, Daiyuan wasn’t especially favored; if any of the younger generation had the qualifications to enter the Imperial Garden, it would be Yin Sudie, not Daiyuan—entries were simply too precious.

Qian Tong chuckled meaningfully. “Daiyuan, don’t look down on yourself. If it were before, you might indeed have had no chance of entering the Imperial Garden. But now… heh, I won’t claim too much, yet there’s at least a seventy percent chance—so long as that old fellow Gong Xinghe hasn’t gone senile.”

Daiyuan’s eyes brightened; she looked at Qian Tong in surprise, as if unsure why he would say that.

She wasn’t foolish; a flash of insight lit her mind. Everything suddenly became clear.

Indeed, if before she had little chance, now among Liuli Sect, only she maintained a good—indeed very good—relationship with Yang Kai. If Liuli Sect truly intended to rely on Yang Kai, they wouldn’t treat Daiyuan poorly.

Would Liuli Sect need to lean on Yang Kai? The answer was clearly yes.

Setting aside the matter of entering the Imperial Garden itself, the Lingxiao Sect was the best place from which to set out—and that Void King-Grade warship was something even Liuli Sect’s Sect Master, Gong Xinghe, could not ignore. He too was a peak Third-Stage Origin Returning Realm expert, yearning for a breakthrough to the Void King Realm.

To breakthrough to the Void King Realm, one must leave Dark Star and escape the constraints of its local heavenly laws.

Boarding a Void King-Grade warship was the only choice.

In that case, Gong Xinghe would surely intend to build friendly relations with Yang Kai and the Lingxiao Sect. That way, Daiyuan would have a chance to be allotted an Imperial Jade and thus gain a slot for entry.

Thinking of this, Daiyuan’s heart stirred. Her beautiful eyes filled as she looked gratefully at Yang Kai.

Although nothing was confirmed, any chance for her to enter the Imperial Garden existed only because of Yang Kai’s presence.

When one’s power and resources reach a certain level, they can subtly affect others’ fates both seen and unseen. Daiyuan had never felt this before, but experiencing it today astonished her.

Daiyuan immediately grasped the key to the matter, and Yang Kai, smiling, said, “Miss Daiyuan, when you return you might tell Senior Gong a word—if Liuli Sect is led by you, this Sect Master wouldn’t mind allowing Liuli Sect’s others to likewise depart from our sect to enter the Imperial Garden!”

At this, Daiyuan’s delicate body trembled; she bit her thin lip, seemingly at a loss for words, but the gratitude in her eyes overflowed plainly for all to see.

Yang Kai’s words effectively snatched a quota for her from Liuli Sect!

The condition sounded domineering, but Liuli Sect would likely make a wise choice—after all, Daiyuan, no matter her faults, was still one of them, and if she benefited in the Imperial Garden, it would strengthen Liuli Sect.

Taking a deep breath, Daiyuan rose slowly and bowed to Yang Kai. She said nothing, but that was enough.

Qian Tong and the others watched with knowing smiles.

In truth, the old fellows didn’t quite understand why such a promising youth as Yang Kai would show such care for a woman like Daiyuan—she wasn’t pretty!

And ‘not pretty’ was a euphemism; Daiyuan’s features were, frankly, hideous!

Yet because of this, their estimation of Yang Kai rose further—this lad clearly was not one to judge by appearances; he was loyal and sentimental.

After Daiyuan excitedly sat down, Yang Kai’s eyes flicked with an idea. “Seniors, if you don’t mind, please do me a favor later.”

“Oh?” Qian Tong looked at him in surprise. “You, who now possess such extraordinary means, what could you possibly need our help with? Tell us and we’ll return a favor.”

Fei Zhi Tu and Mo Yu nodded in agreement, curious.

Yang Kai smiled slyly and whispered a few words to the gathered men.

Hearing this, Qian Tong and the others exchanged glances, their expressions instantly turning colorful. Qian Tong gave a wry smile and said, “You little brat, you truly are full of schemes. If this news gets out, you’ll probably get exactly what you want right away!”

“Indeed! With Lingxiao Sect holding such a prime location, you’re even able to make use of that—what a waste it’d be if you didn’t go into business!” Fei Zhi Tu said with a sharp twitch of his mouth.

“Just living off the mountain when by the mountain, and off the water when by the water—no more than that. Seniors, please don’t tease this junior,” Yang Kai said quickly, waving his hand.

“Don’t worry. After we leave, we’ll spread the word for you. Besides… even if we said nothing, those outside would probably inquire—seems they’re already getting impatient.” Mo Yu chuckled.

Yang Kai’s expression brightened; he couldn’t help but feel expectant.

Yang Kai had asked Qian Tong and the others to spread a single piece of news: that the Lingxiao Sect intended to open the restrictions of the Flowing Flame Sandland and sell several prime locations, allowing the various Sects of Dark Star to enter the Imperial Garden in advance when it opened.

But there were only three slots, and Yang Kai said nothing about the price—whoever paid the most would get them, with prices varying by location.

The best and the worst plots differed by at least three or four hours’ travel from the Imperial Garden.

If someone could offer an Imperial Jade, letting their sect’s disciples depart from Lingxiao Sect’s front hall square would be acceptable.

Yang Kai currently had only two Imperial Jade, but according to earlier estimates Lingxiao Sect needed at least three to meet demand. He and Yang Yan would certainly go in, and Ye Xijun wouldn’t be left behind—her strength would increase security considerably. Lacking one Imperial Jade had troubled Yang Kai, but an idea now occurred to him that should solve it.

Departing from Lingxiao Sect’s front hall square to enter the Imperial Garden was a tempting offer; losing one Imperial Jade was acceptable.

Qian Tong and the others praised the proposal but cautioned Yang Kai to be wary and not give others an opening.

Yang Kai nodded; having made the decision, he would not allow any mistakes. He would have Yang Yan deploy formations around those plots so they couldn’t move about freely, and increase surveillance.

If anyone dared to step out of the designated plots, they would be slain without mercy!

That problem would not be hard to solve.

Afterwards, Yang Kai politely asked Qian Tong and the others about various matters concerning breaking into the Origin Returning Realm. They shared everything they knew, and Yang Kai gained much.

Particularly the opinions of Wei Guchang and Xuan’er proved instructive. They had only recently advanced into the Origin Returning Realm, so many experiences were fresh; while their knowledge couldn’t match the veterans like Qian Tong, it still had value.

Daiyuan listened intently at the side.

Like Yang Kai, she was Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; after returning she would likely seclude herself to attempt the Origin Returning Realm. She still had the Origin Condensing Pill Yang Kai had refined for her.

After a full half day, Yang Kai rose and saw everyone out of the Reception Hall; outside, Wu Yi had a Flying Shark Battle Shuttle ready to escort them out of Flowing Flame Sandland.

Sitting in the Reception Hall, Yang Kai pondered for a while, then took out the Transmission Compass and poured his divine sense into it to call a few times.

After a moment, Yang Yan arrived.

Yang Kai told her his plan to sell the plots. She approved and immediately set to prepare—after all, once the news spread it would trigger fierce competition among countless powers.
