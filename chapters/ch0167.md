## Chapter 167 — Cui'er's Care

Cui'er looked at Yang Kai with sympathy, noticing that he was wearing only a thin, tattered garment. His body was emaciated, and she could faintly see the ribs between his chest and abdomen.

His face was dirty, yet his features were handsome, with bright, spirited eyes, clearly indicating that he was still quite young.

It was truly pitiful to be so small and suffer from hunger and cold, Cui'er thought.

Hearing her words, Yang Kai felt a warmth in his heart and smiled faintly, "It's nothing."

"Make sure to eat well. If it's not enough, just go over there and serve yourself; no one will dare say anything to you," Cui'er said, clapping her hands as she stood up to attend to the lady and young miss.

The night passed without incident, and the next day the caravan set off again.

For two consecutive days, Yang Kai remained with the caravan, sitting beside Old Wu during the day, watching him whip the horses. During breaks, the maid Cui'er would sometimes come over to chat with him.

Through their casual conversations over these two days, Yang Kai learned about their destination.

About three days' journey from their current location lay a city called Haicheng, which was their goal. This group hailed from Tongzhou, originally a small force there.

However, half a year ago, the master of this household had passed away, and the lady took her daughter to Haicheng to seek refuge with a close friend of her late husband.

Cui'er spoke vaguely about these matters, clearly hesitant to divulge too much, but Yang Kai inferred some things from her words.

No one would willingly drag their family away from home, especially a widow and her daughter. This long journey of a thousand li, fraught with risks and worries, was not a choice made lightly; there must have been some dire reason for them to make such a decision.

Yang Kai speculated that the master of the household must have offended many people during his lifetime in Tongzhou. After his death, the lady and her daughter lost their support and had no choice but to seek refuge elsewhere.

The presence of these numerous martial artists traveling with the caravan confirmed Yang Kai's deductions. According to Cui'er, half of these martial artists had been trained by her master during his lifetime, and even after his death, they were still willing to assist in escorting the lady and her daughter safely, intending to return to Tongzhou once they reached their destination. The rest were hired mercenaries.

Along the way, they encountered several bandit attacks but managed to escape unscathed.

Yang Kai also inquired a bit about Haicheng, but Cui'er had never been there herself. She only heard the lady mention that it was a coastal city with scenery unlike that of the inland.

A coastal city! Yang Kai felt a surge of curiosity. If it weren't for this experience of understanding footwork, he doubted he would have traveled such a distance. He was aware of the territory of the Great Han Dynasty, and the southernmost point was the endless sea.

If what Cui'er said was true, then Haicheng must be the southernmost city of the Great Han Dynasty.

With a sense of anticipation, Yang Kai continued to travel with the caravan.

Despite his disheveled appearance, Yang Kai did not bother to groom himself. This group had already formed a preconceived notion of him as a little beggar; if he were to clean up and suddenly appear handsome, it would only raise suspicion.

Over these two days, Yang Kai spent most of his time observing Old Wu's actions as he drove the carriage. He noticed that when the old man whipped the horses, there was an indescribable charm to his movements.

The whip cracked softly, with minimal movement, yet it could make the horses gallop swiftly.

His cultivation was only at the True Yuan Realm, which was not particularly high. However, given his age, he possessed a depth of understanding and experience in martial arts, all of which was reflected in his whip movements.

Yang Kai watched in rapt fascination, and combined with his recent insights into footwork, he felt an uncanny similarity.

Old Wu paid him no mind, continuing to whip the horses, occasionally taking a swig of strong liquor. The old and the young sat together on the carriage, not exchanging a single word throughout the day.

That evening, the caravan stopped again.

Yang Kai got off the carriage and distanced himself from the crowd, as usual, finding a secluded spot to sit down. He pulled a wild grass from the ground and casually waved it around.

The martial artists of the caravan did not particularly like him. No one would favor a beggar; if it weren't for the young miss's kindness, they would not have brought Yang Kai along.

After a moment, footsteps approached from behind. Without turning around, Yang Kai already knew who it was.

"Hey, little beggar," Cui'er's voice called out.

Yang Kai forced a smile, rubbing his forehead, "I've already told you my name; can't you use a different title?"

The term "little beggar" was rather unflattering.

"Little brat!" Cui'er shot him a glare, flipping her palm to reveal two chestnuts. She handed one to Yang Kai and began to peel the other.

This girl often shared snacks with Yang Kai during breaks. He had initially found it puzzling why she didn’t despise him despite his beggar-like appearance.

Later, he learned that Cui'er had a younger brother who had starved to death. The two siblings had once begged for food before being taken in by the lady and her daughter.

Yang Kai looked to be about the same age as her deceased brother, so naturally, she didn’t harbor any disdain.

"Where did you steal these from your young miss?" Yang Kai rolled his eyes.

Cui'er glared at him, "I didn't steal them! These are given to me by the young miss. She treats me very well and shares whatever food she has."

"Then why don't you stay and serve her?" Yang Kai peeled the chestnut and stuffed it into his mouth.

"The young miss and the lady are tired from the journey and said they wanted to rest, so I don’t need to serve them," Cui'er replied. After a moment, she glanced at Yang Kai and asked, "Little beggar, what do you plan to do when we reach Haicheng?"

"I don't know; I guess I'll wander around," Yang Kai shook his head.

Cui'er pouted, "Sounds nice, but isn’t it just going to beg with a broken bowl? My sister did that back in the day."

Yang Kai chuckled, not bothering to explain.

"How about this: you can come with us. Once we reach Haicheng, we will definitely need to hire some servants. I think you’re clever enough; being a little servant wouldn’t be too bad. What do you say? I can guarantee that the lady and the young miss will have no issues with you. Once you save up some money, you might even be able to find a good wife!" Cui'er tempted him.

She had a somewhat charming demeanor and was not unattractive. As she spoke, her expression was filled with flirtation, adding to her allure.

Yang Kai readily agreed, "Sure. If I could find a wife like you, that would be great."

Cui'er covered her mouth and laughed lightly, "You little beggar, you’re truly incorrigible. You deserve to beg for the rest of your life. I’m really considering whether I should let a wolf into the house."

"You really should think it over," Yang Kai said seriously.

He had only casually agreed; his purpose for coming out this time was to train, and he certainly couldn’t go work as a servant. However, refusing now would require some explanation.

"Alright, I won't joke with you anymore. I've never seen a beggar as talkative as you," Cui'er shot him a glance. Lazily standing up, she said, "We’ll reach Haicheng in another day. You should rest well tonight; I’m tired too, so I won’t come to help you serve food later."

"Okay." Yang Kai nodded. For the past few days, Cui'er had been the one to help him serve food, worried that he might be bullied by the martial artists.

Watching Cui'er enter the third carriage, Yang Kai continued to wave the dried grass in his hand, trying to find that feeling from Old Wu's movements.

Before long, the food was ready, and with a shout, many martial artists rushed over.

Yang Kai also stood up and walked toward them, but before he could take a few steps, a figure suddenly stepped in front of him.

Looking up, Yang Kai saw the middle-aged man from that day, his face cold as he stared at Yang Kai.

"What’s the matter?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Get lost; you won't get any food tonight!" The middle-aged man looked down at Yang Kai with disdain, his voice low and filled with menace.

A cold smile appeared on Yang Kai's lips as he quietly regarded him.

"Your gaze is quite good." The middle-aged man nodded slightly, threatening again, "But if you want to die, I can help you with that."

Yang Kai said nothing and turned to sit back down.

He did not wish to conflict with these people; after all, he was being sheltered, and Cui'er treated him well. There was no need to make a fuss over a meal.

Missing one meal wouldn't kill him.

"Good, you know your place!" The middle-aged man snorted coldly.

Whether it was a misconception or not, Yang Kai felt that the man's expression seemed to relax slightly as he turned away.

This change in expression caused Yang Kai's heart to thump, and he instinctively felt something was off. He called out to Di Mo to remain alert and surveyed his surroundings again.

Upon closer inspection, Yang Kai's unease deepened.

Although this place was also a desolate wilderness like where they usually rested, it felt even more desolate. The usual resting spots had traces of people passing through, but this place was definitely an uninhabited ghost town.

To put it bluntly, this was the perfect place for murder and disposal of bodies.

Could it be? Yang Kai felt a sense of paranoia creeping in.

Looking up at the sky, it was pitch black, and the wind howled, making it a moonless, windy night—perfect for murder and arson.

On the other side, many martial artists were scrambling for food, laughing and chatting as they gulped it down. Although Old Wu was just a coachman, his status was certainly not low, as someone was currently serving him food. He sat by the carriage, drinking and gazing at the sky, looking old and frail.

Before long, everyone was full, and the concerns Yang Kai had were not realized, causing him to self-deprecate for being too sensitive.

After the group finished eating, they chatted for a while. Under the middle-aged man's orders, a few stayed to keep watch while the majority gathered around the campfire, falling asleep in their clothes.

Yang Kai gradually relaxed, lying down at a distance with his eyes closed, resting.

An hour later, Di Mo's voice suddenly rang out, "Young Master, something feels off!"

Yang Kai abruptly opened his eyes. Without Di Mo’s reminder, he had already sensed something was wrong.

The martial artists surrounding the campfire were now breathing heavily.

Generally speaking, when martial artists traveled in the wild, even when in groups, they had to remain vigilant. It was impossible to fall into a deep sleep at night; they typically only took light naps to conserve energy and spirit.

They had been doing just that for the past few nights.

But now, these people were all sound asleep, and Yang Kai estimated that waking them would require quite a commotion.
