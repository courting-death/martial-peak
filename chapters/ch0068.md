## Chapter 68 — The Crime Imposed Without Cause

The moment the voice sounded, a figure suddenly appeared before Yang Kai. Without a word, he struck Yang Kai’s shoulder with a palm. The overwhelming force sent Yang Kai tumbling through the air with a muffled grunt.

“Senior Brother Yang!” Li Yuntian and the others were shocked and hurried forward to support him.

Yang Kai struggled to his feet, coughing lightly as he sized up the newcomer. Standing beside Wei Zhuang was a young man with a grim expression, his gaze fixed coldly on Yang Kai. Supporting the staggering Wei Zhuang with one hand, he asked, “Young Master Zhuang, are you all right?”

Wei Zhuang glared venomously at Yang Kai, swaying slightly but shaking his head. “I’m fine.”

“That’s good. I came late,” the youth exhaled in relief. Though his strength surpassed Wei Zhuang’s, he was merely a subordinate of the Grand Elder and naturally of lower status.

“It’s not too late!” Wei Zhuang sneered, his tone dripping with sarcasm. “Brother Cao, as a disciple of the Enforcement Hall, you are well versed in our sect’s rules. Tell me, if someone dares to commit murder within the sect, what punishment should they face?”

Cao Zhengwen’s face darkened. With a resolute voice, he declared, “Depending on the severity, the lightest punishment is breaking limbs and expulsion from Lingxiao Pavilion; the heaviest is execution on the spot to serve as a warning!”

Wei Zhuang chuckled coldly, pointing at Yang Kai. “This man just tried to kill me. Brother Cao, you decide what to do!”

With backing like this, Wei Zhuang no longer needed to endure humiliation as before.

Cao Zhengwen barked, “Is that true?”

Wei Zhuang sneered, “Brother Cao, when you arrived, you saw everything with your own eyes, didn’t you?”

Cao Zhengwen nodded. “Indeed. This disciple held a deadly weapon against Young Master Zhuang’s chest. Had I not intervened in time, Young Master Zhuang would have been poisoned. This man is truly reckless, daring to commit such crimes in broad daylight!”

Their words harmonized perfectly, swiftly pinning the charge of attempted murder on Yang Kai.

“Nonsense!” Li Yuntian shouted angrily. “Senior Brother Yang and Wei Zhuang were merely sparring in a challenge. How could it be as serious as you claim? You are twisting the facts—what is your true intention?”

Cao Zhengwen snorted coldly. “You say it was only sparring?”

Zhao Hu added, “If you don’t believe us, ask the other disciples who witnessed the scene. We can all testify. Besides, this was provoked by Wei Zhuang; Senior Brother Yang was merely caught in the middle.”

“Who will testify?” Wei Zhuang tilted his head, sneering as he scanned the crowd.

The many onlookers from Lingxiao Pavilion immediately scattered like frightened birds, quickly fleeing the scene. Having heard of the elder disputes within the pavilion, none dared intervene. Offending either side would make their future here unbearable.

Seeing this, Li Yuntian’s anger burned, but he still held his ground. “We were present throughout. We know every detail clearly. We are witnesses!”

Cao Zhengwen shook his head. “You have the crime of gathering to fight. How can you testify?”

“Gathering to fight?” Zhao Hu jumped up, shouting, “It was Wei Zhuang who sent his men to challenge us! Where is the gathering to fight? Cao Zhengwen, don’t think that just because you are an Enforcement Hall disciple, you can act arbitrarily. Lingxiao Pavilion is not yours to command.”

“How dare you!” Cao Zhengwen scolded. “The Enforcement Hall represents the sect’s laws, always fair and just. To question its authority is to add one more crime!”

“Imposing crimes without cause, what excuse is there not to?” Yang Kai waved off Li Yuntian’s protests and looked at Cao Zhengwen with a sneer. “Fair and just? Today I have truly seen what that means.”

“Hmph!” Cao Zhengwen sneered and ordered, “Seize them all! After the elders deliberate, we will decide their fate!”

With a rustle of robes, a dozen Enforcement Hall disciples appeared from all directions. Each was at least Open Origin Realm Stage Five or higher. Li Yuntian and the others were no match and were quickly subdued and restrained. Yang Kai did not resist, knowing it was futile.

“We shall see!” Wei Zhuang, emboldened, approached Yang Kai with a cold smile.

“Take them away!” Cao Zhengwen commanded, and the Enforcement Hall disciples dragged Li Yuntian and the others off.

Casting a glance at Su Mu, still unconscious on the ground, Cao Zhengwen frowned. He did not care about Yang Kai or Li Yuntian’s group, but Su Mu’s status was special. Hesitant, he ordered after a moment’s thought, “Take Junior Brother Su to the Second Elder.”

“Yes!” A disciple stepped forward, lifting Su Mu and hastily leaving.

“Young Master Zhuang, you have suffered!” Cao Zhengwen spoke softly.

Wei Zhuang narrowed his eyes, gritting his teeth. “That Yang Kai must not be spared! He humiliated me today. This grudge must be avenged! You know what to do.”

Cao Zhengwen hesitated. “Young Master Zhuang, this matter has grown serious and will surely alarm the Elders’ Council. To act now may be unwise. It would be better to wait for the elders’ decision.”

“But I cannot swallow this grievance!” Wei Zhuang’s face twisted with rage.

“Rest assured, I will teach Yang Kai a lesson so he knows the consequences of offending Young Master Zhuang.”

“Don’t kill him—I want to finish him myself!”

“As you wish.”

Within Lingxiao Pavilion’s prison, Yang Kai and the others were confined. The cell was dark and damp, filled with coldness. Rats and mosquitoes swarmed everywhere, and a foul stench assaulted the senses. The conditions were unbearable.

The prison was where Lingxiao Pavilion detained disciples who had erred. Li Yuntian and the others never imagined they would one day be here, each feeling a bitter taste in their hearts.

“Senior Brother Yang, sorry for dragging you into this,” Li Yuntian sat beside Yang Kai, apologizing softly.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. “This has nothing to do with you. I couldn’t stand watching our own people turn on each other like dogs.”

“Dogs biting dogs…” Li Yuntian nearly choked. Wasn’t he including themselves in that insult?

“Call it infighting if you prefer, but isn’t it just dogs biting dogs?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

“True enough. But don’t worry, Senior Brother Yang. Young Master Su will not abandon us. We only need to wait a few hours here, and he will rescue us,” Li Yuntian said with simple faith.

Yang Kai shifted his position to get more comfortable. “Tell me, why is there discord between the Grand Elder and the Second Elder?”

Li Yuntian sighed. “It’s related to our Sect Leader.”

“Oh? Please elaborate.”

Li Yuntian explained, “Young Master Su mentioned the Sect Leader’s two disciples before. Ever since the Sect Leader personally captured the Second Disciple and banished him to Dragon Confinement Ravine, the Sect Leader has rarely appeared in public. Even the pavilion’s affairs have been neglected. For years, the Grand Elder has acted as the Sect Leader. Perhaps with time, he has grown ambitious and now truly sees himself as the Sect Leader. The Second Elder cannot tolerate this and believes the Grand Elder often oversteps his bounds. Naturally, friction has arisen.”
