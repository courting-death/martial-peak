## Chapter 2397 — Tongtian Island Lord

Bing Long’s earlier guess was correct. Bing Yun had not perished, but had left that world for a vaster sky. Now, she was standing alive right in front of Yang Kai!

Ice Heart Valley was also Su Yan’s sect, and Bing Yun its founder. So, after understanding her background, Yang Kai felt a new sense of closeness to Bing Yun, and his previous restraint and caution faded away.

Bing Yun’s expression remained cold, but a gentle light appeared in her beautiful eyes. Even for her, meeting someone from her home Star Domain in such a place was a rare experience.

“Sit down. I have many questions for you,” Bing Yun said, pointing to a chair nearby.

“Yes.” Yang Kai cupped his fists and obediently walked over to sit down.

Over the next hour, Bing Yun asked Yang Kai many things about Chi Lan Star and Ice Heart Valley. Yang Kai recounted everything he knew, including his relationship with Su Yan and all his experiences in Ice Heart Valley, leaving nothing out.

After listening, Bing Yun remained silent for a long time.

After all, Ice Heart Valley on Chi Lan Star was her creation. Even though she had come to the Star Realm and hadn’t returned for tens of thousands of years, her feelings for it had never been severed by time or distance.

When she heard that Ice Heart Valley now only had a single First Stage of the Void King Realm, Bing Yun couldn’t help but sigh.

Back when she was in Ice Heart Valley, it was the overlord of Chi Lan Star, and even in the entire Hengluo Star Domain, it was a renowned force, with experts emerging one after another. But after tens of thousands of years, the sect had declined so much, which was inevitably saddening.

Still, as a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, her state of mind was extraordinary. She understood that no sect could remain prosperous forever, and no force could stand unshaken for all time. After all these tens of thousands of years, the fact that Ice Heart Valley had survived and its legacy endured was already a testament to the efforts of the disciples who came after her.

“Senior, how did you leave your home Star Domain and come here back then?” Yang Kai asked, seeing her look a bit desolate and quickly changing the subject.

Bing Yun smiled faintly and said, “It was just a coincidence. I entered a secret realm, and when I came out, I was in the Star Realm. What about you?”

Yang Kai scratched his head and said, “A few friends and I used the Star Emperor Tokens left by the Starry Sky Emperor to forcibly open a passage.”

“Starry Sky Emperor?” Bing Yun’s elegant brows furrowed, looking quite beautiful.

Seeing her expression, Yang Kai immediately understood that when Bing Yun had left her home, the Starry Sky Emperor had not yet appeared. He quickly explained the situation to her. After listening, Bing Yun nodded and said, “I didn’t expect such a small place to produce someone so powerful. But as for this Yang Yan you mentioned, I’ve never heard of her.”

“I don’t know where she is now, or what her cultivation or status is,” Yang Kai said with a wry smile.

After coming to the Star Realm, Yang Kai hadn’t deliberately searched for Yang Yan, but he had never heard of a Great Emperor named Yang Yan. At the very least, she wasn’t among the ten Great Emperors.

Thinking of Yang Yan, Yang Kai also remembered the little girl Lin Yun’er. Back then, when Yang Yan left Dark Star, she took Lin Yun’er with her. He wondered how the little girl was doing after so many years.

Back then, she was just a little brat. After all these years, she should have grown into a graceful young lady by now.

“If fate allows, you will meet again,” Bing Yun said softly.

Yang Kai nodded solemnly. Fate was a mysterious thing—uncertain and indescribable. If fate was not there, no amount of effort would help; if it was, even the ends of the earth could become as close as next door.

Being able to meet Bing Yun in the Jixu Secret Realm today was also a kind of fate for Yang Kai.

“By the way, Senior, did you call me here for something?” Before coming, Yang Kai had been a bit nervous, not knowing what this Ice Heart Pavilion Master wanted with him. But now, he was completely at ease.

“It’s hard to find a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist on this island. You’re probably the last one I could find. I just wanted to ask, if I give you enough materials, when can you advance?” Bing Yun asked.

“Advance to Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist?” Yang Kai raised his brows, vaguely understanding. “Senior, do you want me to refine some kind of Spiritual Pill?”

Bing Yun said, “That’s right. The Spiritual Pill I want to refine is of a high grade. If your alchemist rank is too low, the success rate can’t be guaranteed.”

“What pill does Senior want refined?” Yang Kai asked.

“Emperor Yuan Pill!”

Yang Kai’s brows shot up at her words.

As an Imperial-Grade Alchemist, he naturally knew what the Emperor Yuan Pill was for. It was a Spiritual Pill used by Emperor Realm experts to restore their Emperor Yuan. A single Lower-Level Emperor Yuan Pill could restore about ten percent of an Emperor Realm expert’s strength in a short time, a Middle-Level pill could restore twenty percent, and an Upper-Level pill thirty percent, all in a very short period.

However, since Emperor Realm experts usually had abundant strength, they rarely needed such pills, and because they were difficult to refine, there wasn’t much market for them.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected Bing Yun to want him to refine Emperor Yuan Pills, and he didn’t know what she wanted them for.

Just as Yang Kai was about to reveal his alchemy skills, Bing Yun’s expression suddenly changed. She looked up in a certain direction and then shouted, “You, come here!”

As she spoke, she reached out toward Yang Kai. A powerful suction came from her jade hand, and Yang Kai was pulled in front of her without any resistance. Then, she slapped the seat beneath her, and a small hidden compartment appeared.

Without another word, Bing Yun stuffed Yang Kai into the compartment and hurriedly instructed, “Restrain your aura and hold your breath. Don’t come out unless I call you, and absolutely do not reveal your presence!”

Yang Kai had no idea what was happening, but seeing Bing Yun so tense and on guard, he knew something was wrong. She was a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert—anything that could make her so cautious couldn’t be simple.

He didn’t say a word, curled up in the compartment, and immediately used the Nothingness secret technique to conceal all his aura.

With a thud, the compartment was closed again. Bing Yun sat cross-legged above it, unmoving, circulating her power to isolate Yang Kai’s location.

She had worried that Yang Kai’s cultivation wasn’t high enough and his concealment technique might leak his aura, but after checking, she found that Yang Kai had become so ethereal that it was as if he’d been banished to another space. Even her Divine Sense could barely detect him at such close range. Only then did she relax, realizing she had underestimated Yang Kai’s abilities.

She had just finished all this when a figure flashed in the loft. Someone appeared there, smiling, cupped his fists to Bing Yun, and greeted her politely, “Bing Yun, little sister, it’s been three months. You’re as radiant as ever. My heart is truly comforted.”

Beneath the compartment, Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat in shock.

He didn’t know who this person was, but to so brazenly call Bing Yun ‘little sister’—that was beyond bold.

In all of Tongtian Island, only one person had the right to address Bing Yun that way.

The Lord of Tongtian Island, Chi Ri!

Realizing that the speaker was the Lord of Tongtian Island, Yang Kai’s heart pounded, and he understood why Bing Yun was so on guard.

But why had Chi Ri come to Ice Heart Pavilion? What kind of grievances or entanglements existed between these two Third Stage of the Emperor Realm experts? Why did Bing Yun hide him in the compartment the moment she sensed Chi Ri’s arrival?

Yang Kai was completely confused, but he knew Bing Yun was extremely wary of Chi Ri.

Just as Yang Kai was thinking, Bing Yun’s cold voice came from outside: “Chi Ri, are you going to try again?”

Chi Ri laughed loudly, “There’s little joy in life on this island. Only Bing Yun, little sister, lingers in my heart. Since you’ve given me a test, I naturally want to complete it and win the beauty’s heart, so we can fly together!”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s face twitched. He vaguely understood Chi Ri’s intentions. Judging from his words, he seemed interested in Bing Yun. But it was no wonder—on all of Tongtian Island, only Bing Yun could stand as his equal, and she was not only beautiful but pure and flawless. Even someone as powerful as Chi Ri would be moved.

But it seemed Bing Yun had set some kind of test, and Chi Ri hadn’t completed it yet, so he couldn’t win her heart.

In Yang Kai’s view, even if Chi Ri completed the test, Bing Yun might not agree to marry him. She had cultivated for tens of thousands of years and must have met countless outstanding men. If she’d wanted to be with someone, she would have done so long ago. Why would she wait for the Lord of Tongtian Island?

Yang Kai knew that many of Ice Heart Valley’s techniques required maintaining one’s virginity and avoiding excessive intimacy with men. Since Bing Yun was the founder, she must have practiced many such techniques herself.

The Lord of Tongtian Island was just a fool with unrequited feelings. Even Yang Kai could sense Bing Yun’s coldness and rejection—he didn’t believe Chi Ri couldn’t feel it.

Bing Yun snorted coldly, “If that’s so, then come!”

After she spoke, silence fell outside.

Yang Kai didn’t dare use his Divine Sense or leak the slightest aura, so he had no idea what was happening outside.

After a while, the silence was broken by the sound of howling winds, and Yang Kai could sense immense power clashing in a very small space. Even though he was hiding in the compartment, he was terrified, afraid that the two’s power would destroy the loft.

If the loft was destroyed, he would have nowhere to hide.

The fight didn’t last long—just about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea—before the intense sounds suddenly stopped.

Bing Yun’s cold voice came: “You spilled the water!”

Chi Ri said in frustration, “Just a little more and I could have tasted tea brewed by your own hand, little sister. What a pity!”

“Please leave!” Bing Yun said coldly, showing no intention of hospitality.
