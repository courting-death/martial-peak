## Chapter 1095 — Black Rock Beast

Grief needs contrast; once you find someone worse off than yourself, sorrow fades away — Yang Kai's words made Wu Yi feel a certain superiority.

Compared to the homeland of the man called Yang Kai, Dark Star was practically paradise.

She greatly admired Yang Kai for having stormed out of Tongxuan Continent alone and plunged into the Star Domain; her two beautiful eyes were full of worship. She clearly appreciated such reckless bravery, and if given the chance, she guessed she would do the same.

Unfortunately, various constraints kept her trapped here.

As they chatted, the mood warmed and Wu Yi no longer bore hostility toward Yang Kai. He was an easygoing person and naturally had no schemes to harm her. It wasn't until Yu Feng ran over to report something that Wu Yi left feeling both reluctant and intrigued.

After she left, Yang Kai continued to take out Saint Crystals, consume pills, and run his cultivation method to restore his strength.

Time passed. A month later Yang Kai had recovered to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, but the Saint Yuan in his body had not accumulated much — at least compared to before it was negligible.

He kept absorbing energy from the Saint Crystals to replenish his internal reserves.

He had grown used to endless, inexhaustible power that never left him no matter how he used it; this new state made him somewhat uncomfortable.

The energy in the Saint Crystals rapidly transformed into Yang Kai's formidable resources. Saint Yuan surged through his meridians; his heart was as calm as a mirror, and his Divine Sense traversed his channels, examining those hundred drops of the purest Demon God Golden Blood.

Those hundred drops of golden blood had arisen because that altar combined with his vast Saint Yuan — only a hundred drops in quantity, and they would run out; if he wanted to produce more later, what method could he use?

The altar in the Body Tempering Divine Pool was gone, and Yang Kai had not been able to fully memorize the complex array carved on it. Even if he wanted to replicate it, it would be unlikely.

As he pondered this, the golden blood flowing in his body seemed to be stimulated by something and began ravenously devouring his Saint Yuan.

Yang Kai, who had only recently recovered, suddenly turned pale and felt a wave of weakness wash over him.

Concentrating to investigate, Yang Kai was startled.

Half of the Saint Yuan in his body had vanished in an instant; the disappeared Saint Yuan had been swallowed by the golden blood in a short time, and the golden blood that had consumed the Saint Yuan had sprouted a purer shade of gold — only the size of a needle tip.

It was an immature drop of pure Demon God Golden Blood!

Yang Kai's expression flickered as he contemplated a possibility, and he silently released his suppression to let the golden blood continue devouring Saint Yuan.

The hard-earned Saint Yuan depleted rapidly, but that needle-tip golden drop grew a bit larger.

So it was true!

Yang Kai couldn't help but feel ecstatic. Golden blood could indeed be produced by consuming Saint Yuan. This confirmed his earlier suspicion: the reason his vast Saint Yuan had been completely consumed was precisely because a hundred drops of golden blood had been generated.

From now on, if he wanted to refine pure golden blood again, he only needed to expend Saint Yuan.

But the cost was steep; Yang Kai winced. A month's worth of restored Saint Yuan could only refine a grain‑sized drop of golden blood, meaning he'd need at least three months of cultivation to convert all his Saint Yuan into a single pure drop.

Despite his pain at the expenditure, Yang Kai felt reassured.

Saint Yuan could be replenished through cultivation and by taking pills, and acquired by consuming Saint Crystals. As long as he found the right place and method, gaining Saint Yuan wouldn't be difficult. Demon God Golden Blood, however, was not readily available. That there existed a one‑way conversion between the two delighted Yang Kai; unlike Yang Liquid, it couldn't be reversed, but at least the Demon God Golden Blood wouldn't be exhausted completely.

With a hundred drops of golden blood still in his body, Yang Kai was in no hurry to produce more — accumulating Saint Yuan was the priority.

In high spirits, his cultivation pace seemed to quicken; in one day he consumed ten Saint Crystals, drawing every ounce of energy from them.

Wu Yi came again.

Throughout that month, whenever she had spare time she would run to Yang Kai. The news he brought from the outside fascinated her; she listened to everything eagerly. The more she heard, the more she yearned for the outside world, wishing she could order the ship to change course and head straight toward that wondrous realm.

Seeing her plop down in front of him as if ready to absorb every word, Yang Kai felt a headache and muttered, "Wu Yi, I haven't been in the Star Domain for many years; I've already told you what I know and what I've seen. There's nothing I'm hiding."

Yang Kai couldn't tolerate her; a person's curiosity could be so boundless that he didn't know whether to pity her or himself.

"Think about it — there must be things you haven't told me. If it's news from outside, I'll listen to everything,"
Wu Yi persisted, eyes sparkling as she stared at Yang Kai. Previously, when she'd said that, Yang Kai had scraped together a few small tales to sate her curiosity and sent her away. Today he refused to relent.

That little vixen was an insatiable wolf; if he yielded today there would certainly be a next time.

"There's nothing more, really. I've even told you about my flirts with women — what else could there be?"

"Then tell me this: I want to know how men and women outside treat love, and how that's different from on Dark Star." Wu Yi perked up and paid no heed to Yang Kai's sullen face.

Just then, Yu Feng came running and saved Yang Kai.

Seeing his agitated expression, Wu Yi's face sobered. "What's happened?"

"A pack of Black Rock Beasts is following outside the ship."

Wu Yi's face changed and she sprang to her feet, rushing to the window to peer out. When she took in the scene her expression worsened.

She had no time to pry more information from Yang Kai, and hurriedly ran out with Yu Feng.

After they left, Yang Kai moved to the window and looked out. He saw a great crowd of jet‑black demonic beasts clustered near the ship — at least three or four hundred within his sight, and who knew how many beyond that.

Yang Kai had heard Wu Yi mention Black Rock Beasts while they chatted: these demonic beasts lived in the Star Domain, possessed tenacious vitality, and liked to gnaw on ore. So in the Meteorite Sea, on Dead Stars, or on ore planets, traces of Black Rock Beasts were common.

Wu Yi and her companions called such demonic beasts star beasts.

The Black Rock Beasts were not highly ranked. The weaker ones were only Fifth‑Tier, equivalent to the Divine Roaming Realm among martial artists; the strongest reached Seventh‑Tier, the level of the Saint King Realm, but most were Sixth‑Tier.

What troubled Wu Yi was that Black Rock Beasts lived in packs, and what they loved to gnaw on wasn't just ore but also warships!

The ship's hulls were forged from all manner of precious ores, the most delectable fare for the Black Rock Beasts. They were tough and hard to kill. Many ships that set sail from Dark Star had met disaster not because of starry storms but because they encountered Black Rock Beasts.

When a ship was gnawed to pieces by such beasts, the martial artists aboard lost their shelter and suffered casualties. Over the years Dark Star's powers had taken heavy losses from these star beasts. They once joined forces to exterminate them, but the Black Rock Beasts multiplied like bamboo shoots after rain — you cut one patch down and another would spring up; they couldn't be eradicated.

One could say the Black Rock Beasts were Dark Star's greatest enemy and a major obstacle preventing their warriors from venturing deeper into the Star Domain; until this hurdle was resolved, integration into the Star Domain was impossible.

Wu Yi's ship was only a lower‑level Saint King‑Grade vessel and could not withstand the Black Rock Beasts' razor‑like teeth.

So when she heard Black Rock Beasts trailing nearby, Wu Yi's expression instantly changed.

Yang Kai stood still, considered for a moment, and then went outside.

During the month he hadn't integrated into the ship, but no one had bothered him. After all, his true cultivation wasn't high, and Wu Yi allowed him to walk about the ship so long as he didn't go into secret areas.

In the corridors the warriors rushed toward the alarm, each bristling with killing intent. Under Yu Feng's shout, they ran in an orderly fashion in one direction.

Many cursed and vowed to fight the Black Rock Beasts to the death, swearing to live and die with the ship.

Everyone ignored Yang Kai.

At that moment the ship shuddered violently and a terrifying energy fluctuation rolled out. All the warriors grinned as Yang Kai looked out the window and saw a white light beam shoot from a part of the ship, blasting into the Black Rock Beast pack.

Dozens of clustered Black Rock Beasts turned into a mist of blood in an instant; wherever the beam passed the space was left empty — nothing remained.

A Crystal Cannon!

A secret treasure every ship carried, wholly powered by Saint Crystals. Its power was immense, but its consumption was equally enormous.

With Wu Yi and her fellows' finances, they could probably fire it only once.

As expected, the Crystal Cannon's discharge stirred the warriors aboard; the ship's hatch slowly opened, and led by Yu Feng everyone rushed out.

Even Wu Yi was no exception. She wore a fiery red treasure armor studded with flickering flames that seemed to have souls, emitting lower‑level Saint‑Grade energy fluctuations. Her pretty face was set with determination.

After these people left, the hatch slowly closed again.

Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense to sweep the ship and found that, counting himself, fewer than ten people remained aboard — the minimum needed to operate the ship. The rest had charged into the Black Rock Beast pack; the battle was fierce.

Accustomed to the Hengluo Commerce Guild's wealth, Yang Kai felt a subtle emotion seeing a bunch of people fighting desperately to protect a lower‑level Saint King‑Grade ship.

If Xue Yue rather than Wu Yi were in command, she probably wouldn't have gone out to fight; her safety would be worth more than the ship.

On the other hand, if it had been Xue Yue's ship, she wouldn't have fired the Crystal Cannon just once — that madwoman would have kept firing until the Black Rock Beast pack was blasted to pieces.
