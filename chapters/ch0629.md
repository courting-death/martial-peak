## Chapter 629 — Can I Have Both?

Enchantress!

Yun Xuan's use of that title for the woman stunned Yang Kai; he suddenly realized that this woman was not an ordinary person.

"What is an Enchantress?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice, suspicious.

Though his words were quiet, they did not escape the delicate woman's ears; upon hearing them she cast Yang Kai another look, her beautiful eyes pure and untainted, a smile playing about her features as she said softly, "You haven't heard of the Enchantress Lineage?"

Yang Kai grinned, "No. I came out from a very remote corner; I'm not well acquainted with the outside world."

The Enchantress giggled, "Interesting—there are actually people who haven't heard our illustrious name. Hmm, let me see…" She touched her red lips with a slender finger, feigning innocent charm, then after a moment said, "Young man, you have some nerve. Since you want to die with some understanding, I'll indulge you. That girl over there seems to know a fair bit about our Enchantress Lineage; ask her."

"Young man?" Yang Kai exclaimed in surprise. "Miss, how old are you?"

"A woman's age is a secret," the Enchantress tittered, a perfect blend of coquettishness and innocence that left Yang Kai momentarily dazed.

A woman like her dealt a greater wound to a man's heart than even Shan Qingluo could.

Zhou Luo had already lost all composure, gazing at the Enchantress with adoring, infatuated eyes.

The Enchantress glanced at him and snorted softly, clearly looking down on him.

"Yun Xuan, exactly what is an Enchantress?" Yang Kai turned to Yun Xuan and asked.

"Is this really the time?!" Yun Xuan frowned, clearly annoyed. At a moment when life and death hung in the balance, this man still had the nerve to probe into the secrets of the Enchantress—truly besotted and hopeless.

"We're going to die anyway; tell me. I don't want to become a muddled ghost," Yang Kai shrugged.

Yun Xuan stared at the Enchantress above, smiled wryly, and said with trembling lips, "Fine, since we're going to die. The Enchantress… is a branch of the Yao race, a high-tier existence. Each is born peerlessly beautiful, their temperaments varying—some cold, some alluring, some coy, some fiery. In short, Enchantresses are the bane of men; whether human, Yao, or demon, no man can withstand an Enchantress's charm—they are spirits born to seduce the heart."

"The Enchantress's body differs from other Yao; their frames are fragile, so their numbers have always been rare and survival difficult. But once they mature, they are thorny foes, for their strength does not lie in the body but in their Divine Sense! Among warriors of the same rank, an Enchantress's Divine Sense is stronger than anyone else's. Uncle Sun and the others were likely killed by her Divine Sense!"

As she spoke, Yun Xuan gnashed her teeth and stared up at the frail girl in the sky, her eyes filled with hatred.

The Enchantress smiled serenely and made no move to stop Yun Xuan from revealing this secret, wearing an expression of assured victory.

Yang Kai's heart stirred as he suddenly saw a thread of opportunity.

The Enchantress's Divine Sense already far surpassed his own; if he could not lure her Spirit Body into his Sea of Consciousness, his only option was to rely on physical strength.

Yun Xuan had just said the Enchantress's body was frail, and from outward appearances that was indeed true.

Concealing the stirrings in his heart, Yang Kai continued to listen to Yun Xuan's explanation.

"I heard Enchantresses like to feed on people's Essence-Blood," Yun Xuan said, a flush rising to her face as she spoke.

Even Ruan Xinyu's expression grew awkward; a faint blush crept up her tender throat and her eyes shone with a dewy light.

"Quite an appetite," Yang Kai smiled, then puzzled, "Then why did she slaughter the members of the Duao Alliance?"

If she fed on Essence-Blood, she would need her victims alive, yet she killed them without mercy—Yang Kai could not fathom why.

"I do not feed on just anyone's Essence-Blood," the Enchantress pursed her lips in a meaningful smile.

Yun Xuan's face reddened further; already mature and full of allure, her shy expression only made her more enticing.

"She seeks the Essence-Blood of those who are overcome with passion—the men and women aflame with feeling."

Yun Xuan's voice was barely a whisper.

Yang Kai stared, dumbfounded, and hesitated before asking, "What do you mean?"

Yun Xuan stamped her foot, "Don't you know what that means yourself?"

She glared at him.

Yang Kai's face took on an odd expression as he looked up at the Enchantress, "Your tastes are rather vile."

The Enchantress giggled, unconcerned.

Yang Kai's expression turned playful as he grinned, "So does that mean I can still have one last dalliance before I die?"

"Indeed," the Enchantress inclined her head and regarded Yang Kai with interest, "So, are you not afraid?"

"Afraid!" Yang Kai nodded solemnly, then added in a low voice, "But there is a human saying: 'If one must die beneath the peonies, one will be a gallant ghost.'"

No wonder she had left four alive, specifically two men and two women—she had some particular use in mind. At that moment Yang Kai understood.

He was no fool; though Yun Xuan's explanation had been vague, he already grasped what the Enchantress intended.

The Enchantress was surprised—she had not expected the young man's broad-mindedness—and she nodded slightly, "Since you show yourself so reasonable, I can grant you the right to choose."

"What right?" Yang Kai looked up at the Enchantress, smiling.

"You may choose one of these two women to spend the night with," she said.

The moment those words fell, Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu's faces changed drastically; both became extremely guarded as they stared at Yang Kai. Ruan Xinyu even clutched her collar, her expression warning and hostile, while Yun Xuan went ashen and trembled in her delicate frame.

Although Yun Xuan had explained the Enchantress's nature to him, when faced with the reality of the moment she still found it unbearable.

"Can I choose both?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

The Enchantress laughed, unable to contain herself; she had never met such an amusing man—on the brink of death he still had so many schemes. "Young man, you have a large appetite, but you may not feast on both. You can only pick one; the remaining one belongs to that man."

Saying that, she pointed to Zhou Luo.

Yang Kai wore a disappointed expression, then cast a lascivious look at Ruan Xinyu.

Under his stare, Ruan Xinyu felt as if her clothes had been stripped away, as if she stood naked under Yang Kai's gaze; all of her beauty exposed, she flared with anger, "If you dare choose me, you are dead."

"We're all going to die anyway," Yang Kai shrugged, smirking, "Besides, I'm not well acquainted with you and have no interest. I prefer mature women—more alluring, with real flavor."

With that he fixed his gaze on Yun Xuan.

Yun Xuan's face contorted, and she snapped, "You bastard! You know how I've treated you all this time; you owe me a favor—this is how you repay me?"

"What can be done?" Yang Kai shook his head helplessly. "When under a roof, one must bow. Even if I resist, I doubt I could succeed."

The Enchantress lightly clapped, "Wise choice. You humans are such an ugly species; when your lives are at stake, the evils hidden in your hearts burst forth. I've seen it countless times."

"As if you Yao are any purer," Yang Kai sneered.

"Better than you humans," the Enchantress replied with disdainful laughter.

Yun Xuan's chest heaved and her expression struggled; suddenly she steeled herself and snapped coldly, "Even if I die, I will never give myself to a heartless beast like you!"

With that she began to draw in her True Yuan, her entire aura turning perilous—she clearly intended to end her life.

Yang Kai's face changed, but before he could move the Enchantress had already projected a surge of Divine Sense into Yun Xuan's mind.

Yun Xuan went limp and collapsed; her eyes became dazed and her face flushed with spring-like longing as she stared at Yang Kai, a strange light in her gaze—equal parts desire, terror, and some resistance.

"No one may kill themselves before me!" the Enchantress snorted coldly, looking down at Yang Kai at her leisure. "There—you've been struck by my Divine Sense toxin. No woman can resist it. Young man, you've hit the jackpot; do not keep me waiting—begin."

Yang Kai gave a dry laugh, "Miss, would you do me one more favor?"

The Enchantress grew visibly impatient. "What do you want?"

"There are others watching; I'm embarrassed. Can you knock them unconscious?" Yang Kai pointed at the dazed Zhou Luo and the terrified Ruan Xinyu.

The Enchantress frowned, hesitated, then said, "As you wish."

With that she waved her hand and an invisible barrier separated Yang Kai and Yun Xuan from the rest; everything around them vanished, leaving only the two of them and the Enchantress.

"Here you needn't worry about being seen."

"Also, could you—"

"Shut up!" the Enchantress snapped, and poured her Divine Sense into Yang Kai's mind.

In the next instant Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness churned; some strange energy infected his mind and spirit, making him outwardly exuberant. His blood boiled, his breathing grew heavy, and urges he had never felt before rose fiercely within him.

"Begin—let me see what you can do!" the Enchantress chuckled, her beautiful eyes widening as she peered downward; her red tongue curled about her lips as she murmured, "The Essence-Blood of lovers aflame with passion is exquisitely delicious."

She burst into a mad, triumphant laugh; the gentle, tender air about her vanished in an instant.

Yun Xuan gave a soft cry, her face crimson as heat surged in her lower belly; her long, graceful legs clenched as she writhed on the ground.

Yang Kai too felt an unbearable burning; Yun Xuan's mature aura had become the deadliest temptation, and he could not help but throw himself upon her, groping her full form and pressing his lips to her red mouth. A scene of decadent abandon unfolded as the air thickened with depravity; the Enchantress's breath grew heavy and her eyes widened as she watched the struggle below.
