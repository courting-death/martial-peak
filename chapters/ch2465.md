## Chapter 2465 — Heart Demon

Feng Xi's face was dark and uncertain, his Divine Sense constantly sweeping over Yang Kai. All the humiliations he had suffered at Yang Kai's hands surged up in his heart, making Feng Xi's aura suddenly turn violent.

More than two years ago, he hadn't been Yang Kai's match, which was why he had used the Emperor Extinction Pill. But today, things were completely different.

He had advanced to Emperor, while this bastard was still only at the Dao Origin Realm. The gap in strength was vast.

Thinking of this, Feng Xi's heavy mood suddenly relaxed. He gave Yang Kai a cold smile and said, "Whether you're man or ghost, since you've run into me today, there's no good end for you. You're doomed to be utterly destroyed!"

"Oh my, Sect Master is so fierce—are you going to eat me alive?" Yang Kai looked at him with mockery and said, "Actually, I'm quite curious. How did Sect Master manage to advance to the Emperor Realm?"

Feng Xi let out a proud laugh and declared, "With my peerless talent, how could a mere mortal like you ever hope to compare?"

Yang Kai said, "Is that so? But judging by the special nature of your Wenqing Sect's cultivation art, shouldn't my existence be your heart demon? If you don't get rid of your heart demon, how can your Emperor Realm be stable? Or is it..." Yang Kai grinned, showing a sinister smile. "Did Sect Master think I was already dead, so you advanced to Emperor with a clear conscience? Are you sure that's not a problem?"

As soon as these words left his mouth, Feng Xi's face changed dramatically. Under Yang Kai's burning gaze, it was as if he had been struck by a giant hammer—his body swayed and he staggered back two steps.

There was a faint cracking sound, coming from deep within his mind. Feng Xi's face instantly turned pale. He felt as if something inside him had split open.

His Dao Heart! A crack had actually appeared in his Dao Heart. And all of this had started with just a single sentence from Yang Kai.

Back in Binglun City, Yang Kai's provocations and actions had already made his existence Feng Xi's heart demon. If this heart demon wasn't removed, Feng Xi's cultivation would never advance again.

He had thought he had already killed Yang Kai, so he was happy and his thoughts were clear. Only then could he advance to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea. But as it turned out, Yang Kai—the heart demon—wasn't dead at all, and had reappeared before him, alive and well.

Yang Kai's words had directly stirred up the heart demon he thought he had cut away, affecting his Dao Heart and causing it to crack.

Feng Xi's face instantly turned deathly pale. He gritted his teeth and roared, "Die, die, die! I want you dead!"

He suddenly seemed to go mad, his body surging with unimaginable violence. With a wave of his hand, a blast of Emperor Yuan shot toward Yang Kai. The shockwave even sent the two Wenqing Sect disciples beside him flying, and they barely managed to steady themselves, looking at Feng Xi in horror.

The two had never seen Feng Xi in such a terrifying state. One glance told them his heart demon was raging, and he was showing signs of Qi Deviation. Frightened, they hurriedly called out, trying to pull Feng Xi back from the brink.

Yang Kai laughed loudly. Facing Feng Xi's wild but uncoordinated attack, he simply dodged with a flicker and looked at Feng Xi with contempt, beckoning with his finger and continuing to provoke: "Young Sect Master, if you want to kill me, come after me. Otherwise, I'm leaving!"

With that, he rushed off into the depths of the void.

Feng Xi, eyes red, roared in fury and chased after him.

The yellow-faced youth and the scholar exchanged glances and hurried after them, cursing Yang Kai in their hearts for being despicable—deliberately rubbing salt in Sect Master's wounds and throwing his mind into chaos. If they couldn't calm him down, the Young Sect Master might really fall into Qi Deviation.

After all, the Young Sect Master had only just advanced to Emperor Realm, his foundation was unstable, and now Yang Kai had stirred up his heart demon. This was a terrible omen.

But in this situation, the two of them were powerless to help Feng Xi. All they could do was pray he could pull himself out of that rage.

In the midst of their chase, the four quickly left the area where Zi Yu and the others were on that shattered star.

The reason Yang Kai did this was simply to avoid the aftershocks of their fight disturbing Zi Yu's advancement. He hadn't expected Feng Xi to be so easily provoked.

It seemed this guy either lacked mental discipline or just hated him too much, which was why a few words could send him into a frenzy.

An hour later, when Yang Kai judged they were far enough from Zi Yu and the others, he suddenly stopped, turned, and coldly faced the three Wenqing Sect pursuers.

What he saw surprised him a little.

Because during that hour of pursuit, Feng Xi had gradually calmed down. Though his face was still furious, it was no longer the uncontrollable rage from before.

At this moment, Feng Xi's anger was mixed with a bit of clarity.

This made Yang Kai click his tongue in surprise. He thought, this guy really does have some skill. No wonder he could advance to the Emperor Realm so quickly—he's not just an empty-headed fool.

Feng Xi stood a hundred zhang away, the yellow-faced youth and the scholar quickly catching up to stand at his sides. Seeing Feng Xi's improved state, both secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

The scholar whispered, "Young Sect Master, no matter what he says next, you must not lose your temper again."

"I know!" Feng Xi snapped impatiently, then looked at Yang Kai with a cold face and said, "You brought me here so Zi Yu could break through in peace, didn't you?"

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and said, "Young Sect Master really is smart, to even guess that."

Feng Xi snorted, "It's obvious! But it doesn't matter!"

Yang Kai asked, "How can it not matter? Maybe by now Zi Yu has already advanced to Emperor Realm."

Feng Xi sneered, "Do you think the Emperor Realm is child's play? Anyone can break through at will? Zi Yu still needs some time to advance, but killing you is just a wave of my hand. After I kill you, I'll go find her—there's plenty of time."

Yang Kai's face darkened. "Young Sect Master, that's not a very nice thing to say!" He curled his lips in mockery. "Last time, even an Emperor Extinction Pill couldn't kill me. What makes you think you can?"

Feng Xi's face darkened in anger, but he suddenly took a deep breath, calming his agitation. He said coolly, "Last time, I was careless, so I let you escape with your dog life. But this time is different..." His face twisted, his voice cold. "This time, I'll tear you to pieces with my own hands."

Yang Kai said coldly, "Sect Master, don't talk too big. Be careful you can't back it up!"

"Heh!" Feng Xi smiled slightly. "Actually, I should thank you. If you hadn't shown up at just the right time, I really would have thought you were dead. If I kept cultivating like that, and one day learned you were still alive, I might have fallen into Qi Deviation and burned myself to death. But now it's different. I just need to kill you to mend my Dao Heart, perfect my cultivation, and maybe even reach a higher level!"

As he spoke, his eyes shone brilliantly, bright as the stars.

Yang Kai said solemnly, "I didn't expect I'd be so useful to the Young Sect Master. How should you thank me?"

Feng Xi said proudly, "Make your move, or don't blame me for not giving you a chance when you die!"

Yang Kai laughed loudly. "Since the Young Sect Master is so sincere, I won't hold back!"

He raised his hand, and the Myriad Sword appeared in his palm. As Origin Qi surged, the broad sword slashed forward fiercely.

A massive sword light appeared, as if to split the void itself, slashing across.

The power of this sword alone showed Yang Kai's extraordinary strength—far beyond what a Dao Origin Realm could display.

The yellow-faced youth and the scholar beside Feng Xi were both shocked. Facing that overwhelming sword aura, their hands and feet went cold, and they shivered all over.

"You do have some skill!" Feng Xi, however, was unafraid. He sneered, "But how can a firefly compete with the bright moon!"

As he spoke, he too summoned a longsword. With a slight shake, he thrust it forward. The sword tip touched the void, and miraculously shattered the massive sword light, breaking it into pieces in an instant.

The yellow-faced youth and the scholar were overjoyed and cheered loudly.

"Get out of the way!" After dissolving Yang Kai's attack, Feng Xi was full of confidence and shouted at the two, who were in his way.

The two didn't dare disobey and quickly retreated to the side, watching from afar.

"Yang Kai, you're truly not an ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator! If we were on the Binglun City arena, I wouldn't be your match. But in this world, strength trumps all. My realm is a whole level higher than yours—how can you compete with me!" He kept talking, but his hands didn't stop. With each swing, sword lights wove into a net, enveloping Yang Kai.

Not only that, but as he swung his sword, an indescribable profound intent suddenly spread out.

Affected by this profound intent, Yang Kai felt extremely uncomfortable, as if he was losing his fighting spirit. Memories of his time with Su Yan, Xia Ningshang, Shan Qingluo, and Xue Yue kept surfacing in his mind—tender and intoxicating.

Yang Kai was shocked. He knew this was the Supreme Sentiment Art's strange power, able to affect his emotions and desires. It was not to be underestimated.

He bit his tongue, dispelling the discomfort in his mind. The Myriad Sword danced back and forth, sword aura surging as he fought fiercely with Feng Xi.

A strange light flickered in Feng Xi’s eyes. Suddenly, he formed a seal with one hand, then ran two fingers along the blade of his sword, shouting in a low voice, “The fate of an ant—why struggle? Just die already!”

Boom—

A heaven-shaking sword aura shot forth, swift as thunder.

Yang Kai's face changed dramatically. He realized that with his movement and speed, he couldn't dodge this strike. In desperation, he could only use the Nothingness secret art, banishing himself into the void.

His body suddenly faded, and the sword aura pierced straight through him, shooting off into the distance.
