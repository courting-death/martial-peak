## Chapter 1432 — Something Good?

As for who would ultimately claim those plots, Yang Kai trusted that Wu Yi, Yang Yan, and the others would handle it properly—there was no need for him to concern himself. His foremost task now was to break through to the Origin Returning Realm!

After briefly instructing Yang Yan, Yang Kai immediately returned to Tianyi Palace and began his seclusion.

Judging by the size of the protective barrier formed from the Imperial Jade, the Imperial Garden will likely not open for another half a year; trying to ascend to the Origin Returning Realm within that half-year buffer is somewhat hurried, but it was manageable.

This was the first time Yang Kai sought to advance purely for the sake of advancement.

In the past his breakthroughs had come naturally and organically; he never forced them. But this trip to the Imperial Garden carried great weight, and since he happened to be stuck at the threshold of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, he naturally had to give it a try and push into the next realm.

Striving to advance for the sake of advancement runs somewhat counter to the spirit of cultivation, but it posed no real danger. Yang Kai had lingered long at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, had fought in numerous great battles, and had long since comprehended the realm thoroughly. His Saint Yuan was puissant and pure enough to meet the standards for promotion; all he lacked now was an opportunity and a breakthrough point.

In Tianyi Palace Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his expression composed. He did not rush into meditation to accumulate power; instead he calmly took out many medicinal herbs from his Spatial Ring and set up his pill furnace.

He intended to refine pills!

Alchemy was part of his cultivation. Through pill refinement he could steady his mind and temper his Saint Yuan and Divine Sense; this would greatly aid his coming breakthrough.

Very few knew he was an alchemist. Apart from Daiyuan, who had once asked him for help, perhaps only Yang Yan knew; even Wu Yi was hazy on the matter. Yang Kai had mentioned it to her once, but Wu Yi did not believe him.

After all, for a martial artist to reach the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm at Yang Kai's age was already remarkable — who would have the extra energy to study alchemy?

She assumed Yang Kai was merely teasing her.

But Yang Kai truly was an alchemist, and a Middle-Level Origin-Grade practitioner at that; he could easily produce Middle-Level Origin-Grade pills, and when fortune smiled upon him he could even refine Upper-Level pills Origin-Grade.

If this identity were exposed, Yang Kai's standing would instantly soar. Countless forces would compete to court him.

An Origin-Grade Middle-Level Alchemist was an outstanding existence even in other parts of the Star Domain—let alone on a special star like Dark Star. Yet with such status inevitably came the covetous eyes of countless powerful experts.

Yang Kai refined pills to aid his cultivation. He had no intention of devoting all his energy to alchemy — why would he broadcast such a sensitive secret and invite trouble?

Flames of Divine Sense burst forth, engulfing the pill furnace. Yang Kai methodically fed herbs into it, using his pure Divine Sense Fire to refine them.

Time slipped by; in the blink of an eye one month had passed.

Now in Tianyi Palace, before Yang Kai lay jars and bottles of all sizes, each filled with pills of varying grades. Many of the pills bore delicate patterns like the mysterious lines of meridians.

Pill Patterns!

These special markings could double a pill's value. Pill Patterns not only preserved a Spiritual Pill's efficacy against the ravages of time, they also signified that a pill's potency was twice that of an ordinary pill.

Pill Patterns were rare and coveted. Countless alchemists spent their lives trying to discover how to spawn such marks, yet most never succeeded. Yang Kai had taken a different route: by inscribing varied spirit formations into a pill, he increased the chance of producing Pill Patterns to a terrifying thirty to forty percent.

Back on Rainfall Star, the Daoist alchemy master Zong Ao had been astounded by Yang Kai.

At that time Yang Kai had been only a Saint King-Grade alchemist, while Zong Ao was already an Origin-Grade, Upper-Level master. What Zong Ao could not achieve, Yang Kai had done with ease — how could Zong Ao not be shocked?

Although the two had traded methods and Yang Kai had taught him the technique, Zong Ao could only sigh in frustration because he lacked Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire and could not as easily refine with Divine Sense and inscribe spirit formations. Still, a wise man's gain could be another's gain; over the years Zong Ao might have progressed to become a Void King-Grade alchemical grandmaster.

If he had succeeded, he would be the pinnacle of the Star Domain, revered by the world.

Putting aside extraneous thoughts, Yang Kai let his gaze sweep over the fruits of his month's labor.

Three Purities Pills, Jade Spirit Pills, Saint King Pills, Minor Recovery Pills…

All sorts of types—too many to count—covering nearly every kind of Pill. The Spiritual Herbs he possessed had been almost completely exhausted.

With a turn of his wrist, a pale cyan pill appeared between Yang Kai’s index and middle fingers. A refreshing fragrance wafted out, soothing to the heart and mind. The pill was about the size of a longan, its surface covered in intricate patterns—it was a Spiritual Pill that had even formed Pill Patterns.

Origin Condensing Pill!

A supplemental pill that could raise the chance of a Saint King Realm breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm. Daiyuan had gone to Dragon Lair Mountain last time hoping Yang Kai would refine one for her, but back then Yang Kai had casually produced a Origin Condensing Pill that had not borne Pill Patterns — nothing like the one he now held.

Staring at the pill, Yang Kai fell into thought and only after a long while slipped it back into storage.

It was his insurance — a safeguard for his ascension to the Origin Returning Realm!

If he failed to break through through seclusion and hard cultivation, he could only rely on the Origin Condensing Pill's effects before the Imperial Garden opened.

Relying on pills to break through was not unheard of; many martial artists had done it. Ninety-nine percent of cultivators had such an experience, but it deprived them of a little of the insight that comes with a natural ascension, making the breakthrough imperfect.

No one could say for certain whether this had drawbacks or what long-term effects it might have — perhaps none, perhaps it might affect a cultivator's future training. Even if there were effects, they would likely be minuscule.

Yang Kai had never used pills to break through in all his years of cultivation, so he did not want to leave a blemish on his path.

Of course, that was merely a notion; when the last moment arrived Yang Kai would not fuss over small matters. This Origin Condensing Pill with Pill Patterns was merely an assurance.

With the pills finished, Yang Kai inhaled deeply and pulled from his Spatial Ring a fist-sized, round, white crystal.

Origin Saint Crystal!

These Saint Crystals produced by the Stone Puppet through devouring others surpassed even Upper-Level Saint Crystals. Within them was contained an extremely pure and dense energy—nothing could be better for secluded cultivation.

Beneath Tianyi Palace there was also a Spirit Spring Source, and the Spiritual Qi there was exceptionally rich. Combined with the Origin Saint Crystal, cultivation would progress by leaps and bounds; with the five-month buffer, Yang Kai was confident he could raise his realm to the Origin Returning Realm.

Just as he was preparing to sink into concentrated cultivation, Yang Kai's face flickered with surprise and he looked up.

The protective formation of Tianyi Palace had actually reacted, and his brow tightened.

Before entering seclusion he had warned Yang Yan not to disturb him until the Imperial Garden opened. How had someone come to Tianyi Palace after only one month?

Could something major have happened to Lingxiao Sect?

Thinking this, Yang Kai rose, left his seclusion chamber, and with a wave of his hand sent out a few threads of Saint Yuan to shut the formation.

In short order he stood outside Tianyi Palace. There Qian Yue waited; upon seeing him she hurriedly bowed.

"What is it?" Yang Kai asked, watching her closely. He noticed Qian Yue's face showed no sign of anxiety; evidently nothing had befallen Lingxiao Sect. That made his interruption all the more puzzling: if Lingxiao Sect was fine, why had he been disturbed?

"Miss Yang Yan asked you to come over," Qian Yue replied softly.

"Yang Yan?" Yang Kai's mouth twitched; he thought, of course it was that woman — nobody in Lingxiao Sect dared disturb him during seclusion except her. After a pause he asked, "Did she say what she wanted me to do?"

Qian Yue shook her head slowly and smiled, pressing her lips together. "Miss Yang Yan only said she wanted to show you something good."

“Something good, huh?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and gave a cold snort. “That woman must be itching for trouble—disturbing me at such a crucial moment, and even telling me to come in person. If it turns out not to be something worthwhile, just wait and see how I deal with her!”

Saying so, he shot forward.

Opening his Divine Sense, he soon located Yang Yan's position.

Hundred Flowers Residence, where Yang Yan and Ye Xijun lived, was shrouded beneath a wondrous formation. It enjoyed eternal spring and every manner of rare flower competed in bloom — a place of picturesque beauty.

It lay a dozen or so li from Tianyi Palace, but with Yang Kai's current speed ten or so li was only a moment's travel.

He arrived quickly and passed through the flowerbeds. In a pavilion he found Yang Yan sitting on a stone chair with one leg draped over the other, leisurely sipping fragrant tea. Ye Xijun stood behind her like a maid, hands lowered, humble and respectful.

The Stone Puppet was there as well, squatting on the stone table before Yang Yan, its face blank and expressionless, looking just like a statue.

"Yang Kai!" Yang Yan cried out in delight when she saw him.

"If it's something good, bring it out and let me see." Yang Kai materialized before her and spared no small talk; time was pressing and he had no patience for Yang Yan's chatter.

"Why the hurry?" Yang Yan curled her lip, but she made no delay. She reached into her Spatial Ring and produced something that looked like a chunk of ore.

The thing was about the size of a basin, its surface pitted and uneven, with an ancient bronze hue and an irregular shape.

Yang Kai's expression went stern as he looked at it; a trace of something unusual passed over his features.

With his eyes he could tell this ore was of no low rank and exceedingly rare, but what exact mineral it was he could not identify.
