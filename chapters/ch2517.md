## Chapter 2517 — A Fellow Disciple’s Call for Help

When Yang Kai appeared suddenly with Zhang Ruoxi, the demonic beast was in a frenzy, opening its maw to bite at one of the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivators. Whether that cultivator was simply exhausted or caught off guard, he failed to dodge and was bitten in the abdomen by the demonic beast. Blood gushed out instantly as he let out a miserable scream.

At that moment, Yang Kai’s expression turned cold as he swung his fist.

With a single punch, the once-mighty demonic beast let out a wail. Its massive body was suddenly pierced through, blood and entrails spilling out as it died on the spot.

The martial artist caught in the beast’s jaws hadn’t recovered his senses yet, but he struggled desperately, screaming and shouting in agony.

The other two Dao Origin Realm cultivators, however, noticed what happened. They looked up toward Yang Kai, then at the now-dead demonic beast, and their hearts trembled as they realized they had encountered an expert.

Although Yang Kai looked young, to kill an Eleventh-Tier peak demonic beast with a single punch meant he was at least an Emperor Realm expert.

The two didn’t dare be negligent. With solemn expressions, they cupped their fists and were about to thank him when Yang Kai interrupted them, asking in a low voice, “Which direction is Kunyuan City?”

The two were stunned. One of them, a man in a purple robe, quickly pointed in a direction and said, “Sir, if you fly five thousand li that way, you’ll reach Kunyuan City.”

Although he couldn’t discern Yang Kai’s true age, since he was an Emperor Realm expert, addressing him as ‘Sir’ was certainly correct.

Yang Kai glanced in the direction indicated. In the next instant, the air rippled, and he and Zhang Ruoxi vanished from the group’s sight.

A long while later, someone asked in a low voice, “Did I… did I see things? Did two people just appear here?”

“I saw it too, Senior Brother. You weren’t seeing things. He even killed that Green-Furred Tiger Turtle and saved Little Senior Uncle.”

“Ah, Little Senior Uncle is hurt. Quick, get a Spiritual Pill!”

“Little Senior Uncle, hang in there! Don’t die!”

The group of seemingly inexperienced youths immediately gathered around the Little Senior Uncle who’d been bitten, fumbling to treat his wounds. Only the other two Dao Origin Realm cultivators remained where they were, staring in the direction Yang Kai had disappeared, unable to calm their hearts for a long time.

The two of them had no idea how Yang Kai had arrived or left. Even though they’d been watching him the whole time, that Emperor Realm expert had vanished so mysteriously.

If not for the corpse of the Green-Furred Tiger Turtle, they might have thought they were dreaming.

This was the Emperor Realm! The peak realm that all cultivators in the Star Realm longed for and revered.

Once, they too had been high-spirited and passionate, thinking they might one day glimpse the mysteries of the Emperor Realm. But as they grew older, limited by poor aptitude and scarce resources, they could only linger at the First or Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. The passing years had worn away their youthful sharpness, leaving only a desire for a peaceful life.

Glancing at the young disciples of their sect, they saw the same vigor they once had. But in a few decades or a hundred years, how many would survive? And even if they did, how far could they go?

……

On the wooden boat, Yang Kai pushed his Emperor Yuan to the limit, moving even faster than before.

“That token is a disciple token of Qingyang Shrine. Besides representing a Qingyang Shrine disciple’s identity, it can also serve as a Transmission Compass, allowing disciples to communicate with each other. I just received a call for help from a Qingyang Shrine disciple,” Yang Kai explained to Zhang Ruoxi as he stood on the boat.

Ever since Yang Kai encountered Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao in the Origin Sea, he had kept the Qingyang Gold Token close to his chest. His intention was to be able to sense any messages from Xiao Baiyi or Murong Xiaoxiao at any time. Yet, after that meeting, he hadn’t needed to use it—until now.

Yang Kai hadn’t put it back in his Spatial Ring. Keeping it on him didn’t affect his actions anyway.

Who would have thought that in this distant Eastern Territory, Yang Kai would receive a call for help from a Qingyang Shrine disciple?

The message was very short—just a single line.

Kunyuan City, Qingyang Pavilion—help!

Since the message reached his Gold Token, the sender was clearly a Qingyang Shrine disciple. But Yang Kai couldn’t figure out why they were in the Eastern Territory or what danger they’d encountered.

After all, Qingyang Shrine was a sect in the Southern Territory, separated from here by hundreds of millions of li.

But since it was a call for help, Yang Kai couldn’t just ignore it. That’s why he’d hurried to ask for Kunyuan City’s location.

This was his first time in the Eastern Territory, and he had no idea where Kunyuan City was. Fortunately, there was a group of people nearby, so Yang Kai had teleported over at once.

“I don’t know what’s happening over there, but if a fight breaks out, take care of yourself,” Yang Kai instructed.

Kunyuan City was definitely a city, and if it was a city, there might be experts guarding it. Although Yang Kai had already advanced to the Emperor Realm, he wasn’t arrogant enough to disregard everyone. If a real fight broke out, he wouldn’t be able to look after Zhang Ruoxi.

By warning her now, she could act accordingly when the time came.

“I understand,” Zhang Ruoxi nodded firmly. “Sir, do what you must. I won’t be a burden to you.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, and in his urgency, sped up even more.

Kunyuan City was located in the heart of the Eastern Territory and was one of its most important cities. Compared to Ziyue City, it was undoubtedly more prosperous. The area around Kunyuan City was vast and rich, attracting many cultivators to settle there.

The constant flow of cultivators only added to the city’s prosperity.

The city lord of Kunyuan City, Zu Hong, was a First Stage Emperor Realm expert. He had many capable subordinates, and since taking charge fifty years ago, he had managed the city in perfect order.

The city’s laws were strict, and few dared to break them.

Zu Hong had established eighty-one rules for Kunyuan City. Anyone who dared violate them would be punished equally, from public flogging to execution by dismemberment. His iron-fisted yet fair approach had earned him the love and respect of everyone in the city.

At this moment, in the heart of the city, a shop called Qingyang Pavilion was tightly surrounded by a squad of city guards, their uniforms crisp and imposing as they blocked every possible entrance. Not far away, a Dao Origin Realm cultivator lounged in a teahouse, sipping his tea with leisurely grace. His eyes, sharp as a hawk’s, swept over every passerby near the shop’s entrance, vigilant and watchful, as if expecting trouble at any moment.

The surrounding crowd whispered among themselves, all wondering what Qingyang Pavilion had done to draw the attention of the City Lord’s mansion and be surrounded like this.

Qingyang Pavilion was just a small shop, selling nothing special. Most of its Spiritual Pills and Secret Treasures were bought from others and resold, so it barely made any profit, just enough to stay afloat.

Anyone who had dealt with Qingyang Pavilion knew that, aside from the shopkeeper, there were only two assistants. These two were lazy and idle, often sleeping at the counter even when customers came in, never bothering to greet them.

Over time, cultivators familiar with Qingyang Pavilion stopped visiting the shop.

If not for the city guards surrounding it, many people wouldn’t even know such a shop existed in the city.

No one knew what crime Qingyang Pavilion had committed, but since the guards had come to surround it, nothing good would come of it. Cultivators passing by avoided it like the plague, staying as far away as possible, as if getting close would bring bad luck.

Just then, a man and a woman suddenly stepped out from the crowd and walked straight toward Qingyang Pavilion.

The man and woman both looked young. The man was tall and steady, not particularly handsome but very resolute, dressed like an ordinary youth. The woman, however, was stunningly beautiful, delicate and gentle, following closely behind the young man. She looked even younger, barely in her early twenties.

Because the city guards had surrounded Qingyang Pavilion, the area within a dozen zhang was empty. As the pair walked straight over, they immediately drew a lot of attention.

The Dao Origin Realm expert in the teahouse narrowed his eyes, a sharp light flashing as he scrutinized the pair.

He quietly released his Divine Sense, but strangely, he couldn’t sense the cultivation of either of them.

In an instant, the Dao Origin Realm cultivator’s expression grew serious.

He was a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert. For someone to hide their cultivation from him, they had to be either at the Emperor Realm or possess some kind of Secret Treasure that concealed their aura.

There was no way this pair was at the Emperor Realm, so it had to be some strange Secret Treasure.

To have such a Secret Treasure, they were clearly not ordinary. But who were these two, and why had they come to Qingyang Pavilion?

As he pondered, the pair had already walked up to the guards, looking them over curiously. The man shouted, “What’s all this? Haven’t you heard the saying, ‘A good dog doesn’t block the way’? Move aside!”

At those words, the surrounding cultivators were startled.

This man actually dared insult the city guards—he must have a death wish! How could he hope to survive?

Everyone could already imagine him being thrown into the city dungeon and tortured. Shocked, they backed away even further.

The guards blocking the shop entrance were indeed enraged, glaring at the young man with fiery eyes. Their leader snorted, “Watch your mouth, friend. Insulting us is a serious crime.”

The young man just laughed and grinned. “It’s a crime to insult someone? You say that like you’ve never insulted anyone yourself.”

The guard captain said, “By the laws set by the City Lord, I can take you away at any time, throw you in jail, and give you eighty lashes.”

“That serious?” The young man was startled, his face turning pale.

The guard captain looked at him disdainfully and said coldly, “Afraid now, are you?”
