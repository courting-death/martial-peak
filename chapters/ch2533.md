## Chapter 2533 — You Hit Me?

"What does the dirty girl’s illness have to do with this Young Lady? My time is extremely precious. I can’t waste even a moment, let alone a few days. I’ll ask you one last time—are you going to guide me or not!" The red-clothed young lady snorted coldly, unmoved in the slightest.

Old Ban pleaded bitterly, "Just two days, I only need two days. After that, I will definitely escort Young Lady safely into the Ancient Land!"

"Refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit, you old thing, courting death!" The red-clothed young lady shouted sharply, clearly in a foul mood. With a flick of her hand, her soft whip lashed out at Old Ban with a piercing whistle.

The red-clothed young lady’s cultivation was not low. Like Zhang Ruoxi, she was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. The whip she lashed out in anger carried a terrifying momentum, with faint sounds of wind and thunder—who knew what secret art she was using.

If this whip struck, with Old Ban’s First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, he would have no way to resist. He’d likely be beaten half to death on the spot.

But as her whip swept through the air, it was suddenly caught by a hand. The other party didn’t seem to use much force, yet she found herself completely unable to move.

The red-clothed young lady was furious. She turned her head and saw a girl about her own age standing behind her, glaring at her with righteous anger.

The one who caught her whip was, of course, Zhang Ruoxi. Though this girl from the Zhang Family was violent and ruthless in battle, she was usually gentle and pure, with a kind heart. Seeing such brutality before her eyes, she couldn’t bear it and acted before Yang Kai could say a word.

"If you have something to say, then say it. How can you just hit people!" Zhang Ruoxi shouted.

The red-clothed young lady’s brows tightened, her anger surging. "Who are you, little girl? How dare you meddle in this Young Lady’s affairs!"

Zhang Ruoxi snorted coldly, "Calling me a 'little girl'—aren’t you one yourself? No matter what, hitting people is wrong. Didn’t this old man ask you to give him two days? Can’t you see this Little Sister is sick?"

"You dare talk back?" The red-clothed young lady erupted like a volcano, her whole body blazing with fury. She shouted, "Believe it or not, I’ll kill you!"

As she spoke, she suddenly yanked her soft whip, trying to pull it back. But no matter how hard she tried, Zhang Ruoxi held it firmly in her grasp.

Zhang Ruoxi’s small hand looked delicate and fair, yet she gripped the whip with unyielding strength.

The red-clothed young lady’s expression changed. She realized Zhang Ruoxi was not someone to be trifled with. Though both were at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the red-clothed girl clearly only had the cultivation but little real combat experience.

No matter how she struggled, she couldn’t retrieve her whip. Her face flushed red with frustration as she stomped her foot and shouted, "Elder Fu, aren’t you going to act? This Young Lady is being bullied! If you don’t help, I’ll report to my father and have him break your legs! And those two useless fools—how can you let intruders in without stopping them? Later, I’ll strip their souls and refine them into soul slaves!"

She ranted and raved, but Elder Fu still didn’t make a move.

It wasn’t that Elder Fu didn’t want to act—he simply couldn’t.

When Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi barged in, he saw them, but didn’t pay much attention. After all, both looked young, and even if they had some skill, they couldn’t be too strong.

When Zhang Ruoxi reached out to grab his young lady’s whip, he intended to intervene. But the moment he met Yang Kai’s gaze, his heart skipped a beat and he froze, unable to act.

After that, he and Yang Kai just stared at each other for a long while.

At this moment, Elder Fu’s heart was in turmoil. He realized the young man before him was a genuine Emperor Realm cultivator!

So young, yet already an Emperor—was he a prodigy from some great force, or did he obtain some incredible opportunity in the Shattered Star Sea?

Lately, many rising stars in the Star Realm had advanced to the Emperor Realm like bamboo shoots after the rain. It was no secret. In Elder Fu’s eyes, Yang Kai was likely one of those new elites.

Even so, he didn’t take Yang Kai too seriously. In this world, there were very few who dared provoke his young lady, and Yang Kai was definitely not one of them.

So, after being urged repeatedly by the red-clothed girl, he finally acted.

His eyes suddenly flashed with a divine light, turning into an invisible force like a sharp sword, stabbing straight at Yang Kai’s mind.

"A Divine Soul attack!" Yang Kai raised his brows in surprise.

Both he and Elder Fu were at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, evenly matched. Unless Elder Fu was extremely confident in his Divine Soul strength, he wouldn’t risk using such an attack first—if Yang Kai’s Divine Soul was stronger, he could suffer backlash.

Judging by the strength of the attack, Elder Fu’s Divine Soul was indeed impressive, surpassing most at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, and could even barely compare to the Second Stage.

That was likely the source of his confidence.

Once the Divine Soul attack was launched, Elder Fu ignored Yang Kai, as if certain that even if he couldn’t injure him, he’d at least keep him busy for a while. He immediately reached out to grab Zhang Ruoxi.

Seeing Elder Fu finally act, the red-clothed girl shouted excitedly, "Good! Good! Elder Fu, grab that wretch for me! I want to scar her face so she knows what happens if someone offends me!"

As Elder Fu moved, Zhang Ruoxi’s body trembled, suddenly feeling suppressed. Her breathing quickened, and after hearing the red-clothed girl’s vicious words, her face turned even paler.

She was just over twenty, a girl with little worldly experience. If her face was ruined, she’d never dare show herself again.

Though she didn’t care much about her looks, who would want to suffer such torment?

The red-clothed girl saw Zhang Ruoxi’s fear and burst into wild laughter, overjoyed. "Now you’re scared? Too late! I’ll not only scar your face, I’ll strip you naked and throw you out for all those filthy, stinking men to enjoy!"

Zhang Ruoxi’s mind went blank, her already pale face drained of all color.

She couldn’t help but imagine herself being stripped and paraded before a crowd, pointed at and mocked. Terrified, she nearly burst into tears.

If that really happened, she’d never have the courage to live on.

"Hmph! What kind of family raises such a vicious little girl?" Yang Kai suddenly snorted coldly. Even as a man, he couldn’t stand it. The red-clothed girl’s threats to scar faces and strip people were simply too cruel.

Elder Fu, who was reaching for Zhang Ruoxi, shuddered as if he’d seen a ghost in broad daylight. His fierce aura instantly vanished, and he let out a muffled groan, stumbling back several steps, his heart pounding and eyes full of shock.

His Divine Soul attack had been countered by Yang Kai. Fortunately, he hadn’t used his full strength in his haste to save his mistress, or the consequences would have been dire.

This young man's Divine Soul was even stronger than his?

How could that be?

Elder Fu knew exactly how strong his Divine Soul was. Years ago, he’d had a fortuitous encounter and refined the Soul Water Grass, which greatly enhanced his Divine Soul. Ordinary First Stage Emperors couldn’t compare. Yet this young man not only emerged unscathed from his attack, but even left him slightly injured. Could he be a Second Stage Emperor?

He’d long heard that Desolate City was full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Now he saw it was true!

Elder Fu’s face darkened as he looked at Yang Kai with growing apprehension.

He’d thought that with his status and strength, he could at least protect himself in Desolate City, if not run rampant. Now, it seemed he’d been naive.

If even a random young man had such power, just how many monsters were hiding in the Desolate City?

With Elder Fu’s suppression gone, Zhang Ruoxi quickly recovered. The red-clothed girl was still ranting about using the cruelest means to punish her, which made Zhang Ruoxi’s heart blaze with fury. She let go of the whip and slapped the girl’s chest with her palm.

"Ah!" The red-clothed girl had been counting on Elder Fu to save her. She never expected such a turn of events and was caught off guard by Zhang Ruoxi’s strike. She screamed as her petite body flew back like a paper kite.

Elder Fu was alarmed. With a wave of his hand, a surge of Emperor Yuan caught the red-clothed girl.

He didn’t even dare touch her with his hands.

To Yang Kai’s astonishment, after taking Zhang Ruoxi’s furious blow, the red-clothed girl was completely unharmed. She wobbled a bit, steadied herself, and stared blankly at Zhang Ruoxi for a long time before finally reacting, dazed, "You… hit me?"

She seemed unable to believe what had just happened.

"You wretch, how dare you hit me!" The red-clothed girl suddenly went hysterical, as if Zhang Ruoxi had done something utterly unforgivable. Her beautiful eyes turned red, her face twisted with rage.

With a fierce shout, her whip once again crackled with wind and thunder as she lashed out at Zhang Ruoxi with ruthless force.

Zhang Ruoxi was stunned. She’d struck out in anger, but the other girl was completely unscathed. In fact, the sensation of her palm hitting the girl’s chest was strange, as if she’d struck a bundle of cotton, leaving her with nowhere to exert force.

This was the first time she’d encountered such a thing, and she couldn’t help but overthink it.

As the whip came at her, she snapped back to her senses. Gritting her teeth, her figure flickered like a ghost, dodging several times in an instant. In a flash, she appeared before the red-clothed girl, her jade-like palms leaving countless afterimages as Origin Qi surged, raining blows down on the red-clothed girl.
