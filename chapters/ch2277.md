## Chapter 2277 — The Two Forms Record

In the very next instant after Yang Kai appeared, several figures shot through the air with a whooshing sound, suddenly materializing above the Spirit Lake.

The group hovered in midair, not deliberately releasing their auras, but as soon as they appeared, all the cultivators training here were startled, raising their heads to gaze at them.

When their faces came into view, a chorus of sharp intakes of breath rose up.

"Gao Xueting of Qingyang Shrine!"

"Chen Wenhao of Tianwu Sacred Land!"

"Feng Ming of Wuhua Hall!"

"Zeng Yuan of Qiyao Commerce Guild!"

"Lou Chi of Ziyuan Commerce Guild!"

"Even Lord Xiao from Star God Palace has come!"

These six were all familiar faces to the countless cultivators of Fenglin City. The last time Luan Feng appeared, it was these very six who arrived at Fenglin City to investigate, and in the end, they presided over the opening of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda of Star God Palace, allowing the cultivators of Fenglin City to train within. They had thought that being able to witness these esteemed figures once was already a blessing from the heavens, and that they would never see them again in this life.

Yet unexpectedly, after just two years, these six had gathered together once more and returned to Fenglin City. For a small city like Fenglin City, this was simply an impossible event.

Normally, even in ten or twenty years, it was unlikely for even a single Emperor Realm expert to pass through here, but now, Emperor Realm experts seemed to come by every few days.

For a moment, all around the Spirit Lake, there was utter silence, so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. Everyone looked up in awe.

The six seemed to realize this as well. Lou Chi of Ziyuan Commerce Guild let out a chuckle and said, "I've always felt there was something unusual about this Fenglin City. I’ve long wanted to set up a branch here, but never had the time. Now it seems, establishing a branch is inevitable."

Although Ziyuan Commerce Guild already had businesses in Fenglin City—like the Spiritual Pill Shop once managed by Kang Siran—there’s a difference between a branch and an industry.

A branch is a symbol of a Commerce Guild, and must have an expert stationed there to oversee everything. As for industries, they can be large or small. The Spiritual Pill Shop was just a tiny store—if not for the major events that kept happening in Fenglin City, Lou Chi might never have even heard of it.

Yet Lou Chi was thoroughly familiar with the situation of every branch.

If Ziyuan Commerce Guild really did set up a branch here, it would greatly boost Fenglin City’s economy. Given time, Fenglin City would no longer be an obscure little town.

"Hindsight!" Zeng Yuan sneered. Qiyao Commerce Guild and Ziyuan Commerce Guild were the two great Commerce Guilds of the Southern Territory, and competition between them was fierce. As vice presidents of their respective guilds, Zeng Yuan and Lou Chi naturally didn’t see eye to eye. Hearing Lou Chi speak like this, he immediately jabbed, "If you really had such foresight, you fat bastard, why are you only saying it now?"

Lou Chi squinted at him and snorted, "How could a mere mortal like you hope to glimpse this Lord’s far-reaching vision?"

"Keep bragging, as if boasting costs you nothing!" Zeng Yuan sneered, utterly disdainful.

Lou Chi roared in anger, then turned to Xiao Yuyang, cupping his fists, "Lord Xiao, Lou Chi requests a martial duel to the death with this horse-faced freak!"

Zeng Yuan’s brow twitched, veins bulging on his forehead as he gritted his teeth, "Who are you calling horse-faced freak?"

He pulled a long face, making his already long cheeks look even longer.

Lou Chi glanced at him sideways and snorted, "Then who are you calling fat bastard?"

Zeng Yuan mocked, "So what if you’re fat? If you’ve got the guts, cut off that belly full of flab." As he spoke, he grinned and patted Lou Chi’s big belly.

Lou Chi stepped back a few paces and shouted, "Hey, you horse-faced freak! Talk all you want, but keep your hands to yourself." He turned to Xiao Yuyang and said, "Lord Xiao, you saw it—this guy is going too far. Today, I’ll fight him to the bitter end!"

"Enough, enough!" Xiao Yuyang wiped sweat from his brow. "You’re both businessmen—don’t you know harmony brings wealth? Why start fighting the moment you meet? Do you want the juniors below to laugh at you?"

Hearing this, the two looked down and saw countless eyes staring up at them, mouths agape in shock that Emperor Realm experts could act like this.

"It’s embarrassing to stand with you two!" Gao Xueting looked at them with utter contempt.

"Indeed, both our status and prestige have been dragged down," Chen Wenhao added expressionlessly.

Feng Ming, standing to the side, chuckled, his eyes flashing. Suddenly, his expression changed as he turned to look in a certain direction, exclaiming, "Hey, isn’t that the kid who refined the Supreme Mystic Pill? What’s he doing in Fenglin City?"

Following his gaze, everyone immediately looked toward Yang Kai.

"It really is him!" Xiao Yuyang smiled. "Come to think of it... I always thought this kid looked familiar. Turns out we met before in Fenglin City."

"This kid’s a real talent. I want him for Ziyuan Commerce Guild!" Lou Chi’s eyes lit up as he looked at Yang Kai.

Zeng Yuan snorted, "Maybe he already has a Sect. Who says you get to recruit him?"

Lou Chi sneered, "If I personally step forward, what Sect would dare refuse me? Horse-faced freak, I’m warning you—if you try to compete with me this time, I’ll fight you to the death!"

Zeng Yuan frowned, falling silent as if weighing the pros and cons.

Gao Xueting said coolly, "Vice President Lou, did you even ask for my opinion before making such a decision?"

Lou Chi’s eyes went wide as he stared at Gao Xueting in astonishment, "What’s this got to do with Elder Gao?"

Gao Xueting tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and said calmly, "That kid has long been mine..."

"Gulp!"

The sound of swallowing echoed out. Xiao Yuyang’s eyes also flashed with surprise as he kept glancing at Gao Xueting.

"Y-you... yours?" Lou Chi was completely tongue-tied, feeling that there was a huge amount of information hidden in that one sentence...

Zeng Yuan was even more dumbfounded, weakly asking, "Doesn’t Hall Master Wen... have any objections?"

"What objections could he have?" Gao Xueting looked at Zeng Yuan in confusion, not understanding his question. But soon, she seemed to recall something, her face turning cold as a blush crept up her cheeks. Her delicate body trembled, and the Imperial Treasure Scorching Sun Mirror suddenly floated above her head. Flames erupted from the mirror, making everyone’s skin tingle. Gao Xueting said coldly, "If any of you dare let your imaginations run wild, I’ll cut you into eighteen pieces!"

"Why such a specific number—eighteen? Is there some special meaning?" Lou Chi, ever the businessman, couldn’t help but fixate on the number.

"That’s not the point!" Zeng Yuan shot Lou Chi a look of disdain, then turned to Gao Xueting, "So, this kid is already a disciple of Qingyang Shrine?"

Gao Xueting snorted, put away the Scorching Sun Mirror, and didn’t answer, looking inscrutable.

How could she tell them she had tried to recruit Yang Kai but he had politely refused? It would be too embarrassing. After all, she was an elder of a great force like Qingyang Shrine, and even after personally reaching out to a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, she had failed. No one would believe it if she told the truth.

Xiao Yuyang smiled and said, "Lan Xun thinks very highly of this kid, believes he’ll achieve great things in the future. Since Elder Gao has already taken him in, I must offer my congratulations."

"You’re too kind, Lord Xiao," Gao Xueting replied coolly.

As they spoke, they kept glancing in Yang Kai’s direction.

The people around Yang Kai felt as if a mountain was pressing down on them, cold sweat pouring from their foreheads.

Most people looked on in amazement, not understanding why Yang Kai was attracting so much attention from so many experts.

"Alright, since everyone is here, let’s deal with the matter of the Spirit Lake first." Xiao Yuyang changed the subject, looking down at the Spirit Lake below, his eyes flashing. "Before coming here, I’d heard a bit about the situation, but I didn’t expect the Spiritual Qi here to be so dense!"

Chen Wenhao’s expression changed as he asked in a deep voice, "How does it compare to the Heaven-Grade Sacred Land of the palace?"

The others also looked at Xiao Yuyang curiously, wanting to know just how impressive the Heaven-Grade Sacred Land of Star God Palace was.

Xiao Yuyang was silent for a moment, then said, "It’s a bit inferior, but not by much!"

At these words, everyone was shaken.

The Spirit Lake below was the densest place for Spiritual Qi they had ever seen. No training ground in their own sects could compare. Yet it still couldn’t match the Heaven-Grade Sacred Land of Star God Palace. One could only imagine how dense the Spiritual Qi there must be.

No wonder Star God Palace could dominate the Southern Territory for so long. Even without mentioning the top expert Radiant Moon Great Emperor, just that Heaven-Grade Sacred Land alone could produce countless experts, enough to sustain a Sect for generations.

Realizing the gap, everyone felt a bit dejected.

"That aside, it seems there are eighteen Spirit Springs beneath this lake, constantly supplying Spiritual Qi and forming the Spirit Lake. But if this continues unchecked, it won’t be long before it dries up. We must seal it off first." As Xiao Yuyang spoke, he looked at Lou Chi, "Brother Lou, I recall your Imperial Treasure, the Two Forms Record, has the power to seal and suppress, right?"

Lou Chi smiled proudly, "Lord Xiao, you have a good memory."

Xiao Yuyang said, "Then I’ll trouble you, Brother Lou."

Lou Chi replied, "At Lord Xiao’s command, I shall obey."

As he finished speaking, he stepped forward, his expression turning solemn.

His foot landed on empty air, yet visible ripples spread out, radiating in all directions.

Boundless Emperor Intent descended and spread. The cultivators gathered around the Spirit Lake immediately realized that an Emperor Realm expert was about to act. Their faces changed, and they quickly retreated to avoid being caught in the aftermath.

Lou Chi then grasped at the air, and a thick tome suddenly appeared in his hand. The tome seemed to have come from ancient times, bearing the marks of endless years and tribulations, exuding a mysterious and profound aura.

Everyone’s attention was instantly drawn to it.

Yang Kai’s eyes also shone with interest.

Although he knew Lou Chi was taking out an Imperial Treasure, it was his first time seeing this type of treasure, and he had no idea what kind of mysterious powers it held.

"The Imperial Treasure, Two Forms Record!" Duan Yuanshan, who seemed to have heard of it before, called out in a low voice from the side.
