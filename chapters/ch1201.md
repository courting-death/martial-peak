## Chapter 1201 — Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree

Shen Shitao was already worried whether her Spatial Ring was large enough, and whether she should contact other sectmates to come help mine. Who cared about the Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine outside — as long as there were enough Saint Crystal, who would fail to find good things?

Thinking that, Shen Shitao suddenly cast a burning look at Yang Kai, as if trying to gauge how thick the fortune hidden in his body truly was that he could so casually lead them to such a tremendous boon.

To be safe, they still checked a few other passages to see if there was anything besides Saint Crystal, and, as expected, the three or five passages they inspected were filled with huge Upper-Level Saint Crystals exposed to the air.

"There's still time; disperse and mine separately. Gather as much as you can before the Flowing Flame Sandland closes. If we could exhaust the whole vein it'd be ideal; if not..." Shen Shitao hesitated for a moment, glanced at Yang Kai, and seeing no reaction from him, added, "Then take the news back to the Sect and have others come mine it when the Flowing Flame Sandland opens next time!"

By her thinking, she ought to contact other sectmates now — the more who came, the faster the mining and the greater the spoils. But besides the five from their Qiantian Sect there were two outsiders, Yang Kai and Chang Qi, and Shen Shitao didn't want to summon more people and risk offending them.

Chang Qi didn't care; this youth Yang Kai seemed blessed with great fortune, and Shen Shitao wanted to get on his good side — perhaps there might be benefits in following him in the future.

Yang Kai was very satisfied with her decision and nodded his agreement at once.

The seven of them immediately dispersed, each entering a passage and using techniques to harvest Saint Crystal.

Yang Kai naturally chose the passage he had long been watching. Not even ten zhang in, the road ahead was blocked by a massive Saint Crystal. Yang Kai condensed Demonic Flame in his hand into the shape of a dagger and easily sliced into the Saint Crystal vein, cutting down huge chunks, each larger than a washbasin, then tossed them into his Spatial Ring.

Yang Kai wasn't as obsessed with mining Saint Crystal as the others, but more Saint Crystal was never a bad thing.

While he labored at mining he carefully searched the surroundings, trying to find where that little snake-shaped Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object had concealed itself. He was certain it had slipped into this passage, but there were no other exits and he found nothing suspicious.

The Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object seemed to have vanished after entering here, which left Yang Kai very puzzled.

After thinking it over, aside from burrowing into the Saint Crystal itself there was no reasonable explanation he could find — but what kind of heaven-and-earth spirit could burrow into Saint Crystal? He had never heard of such a thing.

Moreover, this place felt strange. With such an enormous Saint Crystal vein underground, the plain above should be carpeted with Spiritual Herb and Spiritual Medicine, but up top there was nothing but weeds.

He could not fathom why, so he continued to search and dig deeper. Large chunks of Saint Crystal were tossed into his Spatial Ring, and the vein within his passage decreased rapidly.

The dagger formed from Demonic Flame was unimaginably sharp and could cut Saint Crystal with ease, but the Demonic Flame burned everything it touched, so cutting caused significant loss.

A loss here and there was acceptable, but over time the amount would be incalculable.

After some thought, Yang Kai forced out a drop of Golden Blood and shaped it into the form of a short sword.

The Golden Blood short sword only needed to draw across the Saint Crystal vein and it cut through like slicing tofu. The ease of it was unimaginable — speed rose and the wastage vanished. Yang Kai was very pleased.

A day later Yang Kai had harvested a great deal of Saint Crystal, yet the little snake-shaped Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object remained nowhere to be found, and his passage extended another dozen or so feet inward.

As Yang Kai labored at his mining, light footsteps came from the entrance, and Chang Qi's figure soon appeared there.

The Guest Elder now wore an inexplicably excited expression, suppressing his aura and footsteps; seeing Yang Kai's puzzled look, he waved at him and acted mysteriously.

From his expression Yang Kai knew he had found something good. His eyes brightened and he quietly walked over.

After following Chang Qi out, Yang Kai transmitted his Divine Sense and asked, "Did you find the whereabouts of that Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object?"

Chang Qi froze for a moment, a blank look on his face.

"It was hiding here? It went into my passage — unfortunately I didn't discover it."

Chang Qi shook his head and replied, "I didn't come for it. I found something very peculiar. I'm old and my eyes are poor, so I couldn't recognize it and dared not meddle. You come from the outside and have seen much; you might know what it is."

Hearing this, Yang Kai was somewhat disappointed but also curious. He fell silent and followed Chang Qi into another passage.

The Saint Crystal vein in that passage had already been mined some by Chang Qi, though not as much as Yang Kai had taken — only about half the yield. Even so, it was a tremendous fortune.

"Look at this — do you recognize it?" Chang Qi pointed ahead.

Yang Kai looked in the direction he indicated and his eyes narrowed.

Embedded within the Saint Crystal ahead was something that resembled a small tree, roughly three chi high. Every twig and leaf appeared as if polished from crystal stone, white and translucent, exquisitely beautiful.

It seemed to have grown from within the Saint Crystal, yet also to be frozen like a fossil, vivid and lifelike.

No sign of life could be felt from it, yet a variety of wondrous auras radiated from its branches and leaves. Whether it was Chang Qi or Yang Kai, both felt as though they were being enlightened the moment they sensed that aura.

Chang Qi even perceived his years-long bottleneck showing faint signs of loosening.

The sight terrified him and he hastily suppressed his stirring Saint Yuan, forbidding any stray thought.

This was the Flowing Flame Sandland. Any Origin Returning Realm expert who entered would be doomed; Chang Qi was now at the peak of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. If he broke here and reached the Origin Returning Realm, he would only be killed by the Sandland's laws with no hope of escape.

It was precisely because of this worry that Chang Qi rushed to find Yang Kai upon discovering the white jade-like little tree.

First, he did not know what it was and how to handle it; second, he did not dare touch it — if it caused a breakthrough, it would be a blunder that cost him his life, though he also knew it was an extraordinary thing.

Yang Kai, however, plunged unabashed into the wondrous aura and wore an expression of utter satisfaction.

He soon composed himself, his expression shifting as he studied the small tree in the Saint Crystal, then after a long moment he exhaled softly and said, "This should be a Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree."

"Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree?" Chang Qi evidently had never heard of it and asked in astonishment, "What's that?"

"A heaven-and-earth treasure!" Yang Kai's voice fell low. "A grade above a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object. I once saw records of it in a tome at Zong Ao on Rainfall Star. It only appears in rich veins of Upper-Level Saint Crystal, born of the vein's essence after tens of thousands of years. It first produces a tiny sprout; this Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree has already reached three chi in height — it has existed here for at least twenty to thirty thousand years, perhaps even longer."

Chang Qi could not help but be moved.

Anything that had endured for twenty or thirty thousand years was extraordinary; even a mere weed might awaken into a Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object.

But this Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree had been born from the Saint Crystal vein itself, and from a rich deposit of Upper-Level Saint Crystal at that. Its origin alone was supremely high; one could imagine the staggering value it possessed.

Yang Kai's knowledge of such things came from records at Zong Ao on Rainfall Star. The tomes there were messy, but precisely because of that he had learned many wondrous things — the records mentioned the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, the Warm Spirit Lotus, and other heaven-and-earth treasures.

Although the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree was not as valuable as the Warm Spirit Lotus, it was no common treasure.

Both the Warm Spirit Lotus and the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree were things warriors across the Star Domain had only heard of; they had only flickered into being in ancient times and then vanished without a trace.

“What’s its use? Can it be used for alchemy?” Chang Qi asked at once, seeing that Yang Kai indeed seemed to know something about the thing.

"Alchemy?" Yang Kai chuckled. "Of course it can be used for pill refinement, but using it that way would be to rob heaven itself. If those who know of the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree learned of it, they'd grind us to dust."

Chang Qi flushed scarlet, realizing his ignorance and that he'd asked a foolish question.

"Its greatest wondrous use you should understand — training near it can help a warrior break through their bottleneck. That's a priceless thing," Yang Kai clicked his tongue.

Most things that assisted breakthroughs were special pills, but pills were an external push — if they failed to cause a breakthrough, taking a second pill had no effect. The Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree was different: it made a cultivator truly comprehend their own cultivation and state, letting the bottleneck naturally vanish.

Taking a pill was an external aid; the tree's miracle solved the cultivator's shackles from the root. The two were not comparable.

Hearing this, Chang Qi's eyes instantly brightened and his whole body trembled with excitement.
