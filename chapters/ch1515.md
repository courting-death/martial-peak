## Chapter 1515 — Interference

Qu Zheng's heart felt as if it were being torn by a blade; the Battle Sky Alliance's foundation, built over tens of thousands of years, was now truly, truly on the verge of being destroyed by his own hands.

At this moment he faintly regretted provoking Yang Kai, that murderous, terrifying existence; even if he had defied Star Emperor Mountain's orders, perhaps the outcome would not have been this disastrous.

The great tide has already turned!

Qu Zheng understood better than anyone that the moment the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array was ruined, this battle was already lost.

That array had been his proudest bastion, yet the other side unraveled it in a few moves—the speed was simply inconceivable.

Even if they killed Yang Kai now, it would likely not be enough to salvage the Battle Sky Alliance's enormous losses.

But was Yang Kai so easy to kill? Qu Zheng had no confidence he could slay a warrior versed in spatial power, one even capable of tearing space and escaping!

"Alliance Master…" Mo Xiaosheng called softly from the side; his already aged face seemed to grow even older in that instant, his expression grave as he said, "We should go."

"Go?" Qu Zheng turned to him and slowly shook his head. "As Alliance Master of the Battle Sky Alliance, while the Alliance lives, I live; should the Alliance fall, I die with it. I will not flee!"

"Alliance Master, preserve your life and the Alliance will live on—there will be fuel for the fire. This time we underestimated the Lingxiao Sect's strength; our losses are incalculable. But as long as you remain, there will be a chance to avenge our fallen disciples. If you die here, who will avenge them?" Mo Xiaosheng urged desperately.

Qu Zheng shot him a look and said sternly, "That may be so, but where in this vast world can I go? If I can still fight, then even should I die, I will drag that little bastard down with me."

"Alliance Master, have you forgotten who started this? If we flee to that place, they surely won't stand idly by either," Mo Xiaosheng said in a low voice.

Qu Zheng frowned and pondered carefully.

Liang Yong, who had stood nearby the whole time, hurriedly spoke up: "Indeed, Alliance Master, the Lingxiao Sect's momentum is at its peak; we should avoid the limelight for now. We cannot deal with that warship, but Star Emperor Mountain may have means."

In the main hall, the Battle Sky Alliance's Great Elder and Third Elder did their utmost to persuade him, and others chimed in alongside them.

After all, who would willingly seek death if they could live? The enemy’s warship was simply too terrifying—something no human strength could possibly stand against.

Everyone feared Qu Zheng would order them to go out and face it; naturally, they wanted to leave this place as quickly as possible.

For a time, everyone spoke at once, a chaotic din.

Qu Zheng seemed to have come back to his senses. His gaze swept over the crowd, and he gave a slight nod. “Very well. For now, we’ll withdraw—head for Star Emperor Mountain!”

"Alliance Master, your wisdom is unmatched!" Relief visibly dropped from their chests and they all breathed out in unison.

…

In the inner city, screams had not ceased since the attack began; one after another, warriors affected by the Glazed Light and then ensnared by the Mirage Stone's uncanny power were dragged into illusions and slain at the hands of the Lingxiao Sect.

Thousands of warriors—now barely one in ten remained.

As time passed, the Mirage Stone's influence gradually waned.

When the hallucinations faded and the situation became clear, the surviving Battle Sky Alliance warriors were filled with horror; no one dared stay to fight. They all used their movement arts and defensive Secret Treasures to dash outward.

The troops routed like a collapsing mountain!

The entire inner city seemed dyed red with blood. The ground was littered with severed limbs and torn flesh; the rank stench of blood permeated the vast city, making one nauseous at the smell.

Golden light filled the sky as dozens of Golden Blood Threads formed cutting blades that shredded the enemies blocking the way; Yang Kai's expression was as calm as a still well.

Though he rampaged through the enemy ranks and slew many, his clothes remained clean—not a drop of blood stained them.

After a while he looked up toward a direction and his brow tightened.

A strange fluctuation of power came from that direction—it was the ebb of Spatial Force!

In an instant he discerned what that fluctuation was; a cold smile curled at the corner of his mouth as he lightly slashed the void before him.

A pitch-black spatial rift eerily opened, and Yang Kai dove in, his figure vanishing.

In the inner city of the Battle Sky Alliance, within a secret underground chamber, more than a dozen elders and protector-level powerhouses of the alliance were gathered.

At this moment they watched the great Space Array ahead with expectant yet anxious faces.

As one of the two great powers on Dark Star, the Battle Sky Alliance had stood for thousands upon tens of thousands of years and knew to leave itself a way out; the Space Array in this underground chamber was one such lifeline.

For thousands upon ten thousands of years it had never been used, for no one had ever been able to force the Battle Sky Alliance to resort to it.

But today that sealed sanctuary was finally opened.

Qu Zheng intended to use it to leave Battle Sky City and travel to some place a million li away.

Although it had never been used, the Space Array was intact; after a brief adjustment and the insertion of Saint Crystals, the array began to function.

"I and the Great Elder will go first; Third Elder, you shall stay to cover our rear," Qu Zheng ordered as he and Mo Xiaosheng walked together toward the Space Array.

Liang Yong opened his mouth as if to speak, but swallowed his words and responded with clasped fists, "Yes!"

He was truly frightened of Yang Kai—last time at the Fallen Emperor Mountains he had barely escaped death at Yang Kai's hands. Although Yang Kai had been true to his word and not killed him, Yang Kai had since become his nightmare.

He naturally wanted to leave as soon as possible.

But the Alliance Master's order had been given; Liang Yong had no choice but to obey and cover the rear.

This Space Array could transport at most five people at a time, so they had to leave in batches.

When Qu Zheng and the others stood in position the array immediately burst into light and enveloped the five.

Just as the five figures began to fade and were about to depart, an anomaly occurred.

From the void before them came a chill-inducing fluctuation of energy, and then a one-zhang-long pitch-black rift strangely materialized.

"What is that…" everyone froze, not understanding what it could be.

"A spatial rift!" Qu Zheng shouted—he had seen one before at the Fallen Emperor Mountains and was familiar with it now.

No sooner had he finished speaking than a figure shot out of the rift. Without a moment's hesitation, the figure reached out and viciously grabbed at the already-activated Space Array.

A veiled, unfathomable, and extremely mysterious force swept forth.

The Space Array, which had been blazing, trembled and its dazzling light dimmed at tremendous speed.

"Not good!" Mo Xiaosheng cried out and, without thinking, grabbed Qu Zheng's arm and bolted outward like a frightened rabbit.

In a flash the two had moved some ten or so zhang away.

"Yang Kai!" Qu Zheng's eyes flew wide with rage as he glared at the figure that had emerged from the rift, his face a terrifying mask of fury.

"Alliance Master, where do you think you're going?" Yang Kai cast him a sidelong glance, his tone mocking.

Before Qu Zheng could reply, someone nearby cried out in alarm, "Elder Zhou, Protector Qi…"

The voice was frantic, evidently shaken by great fear.

Qu Zheng frowned, his face darkening as he looked over, and a chill ran from his head to his heels.

On the Space Array remained three incomplete corpses.

Judging by their clothing, they had been the subordinates who had been standing at the array preparing to be transported; now their upper halves had vanished in a bizarre manner, leaving only their lower bodies standing in place. The cuts were neat, as if severed cleanly by some sharp blade.

"Great Elder!" the person who had spoken a moment ago shouted again, staring at Mo Xiaosheng with eyes trembling violently.

A ticking, dripping sound echoed loudly.

Qu Zheng turned his head and found his scalp prickling.

The Great Elder who had helped him out of the Space Array was missing an arm—the wound on the arm was the same as those on the others, neat and smooth.

"You can even interfere with a Space Array's transmission!" Mo Xiaosheng's face went pale; he seemed to be suppressing immense pain as he stared at Yang Kai in disbelief and snarled through his teeth, "You have refined spatial power to this degree?"

"How embarrassing," Yang Kai said coolly, not denying it.

Qu Zheng's expression shifted; with his experience and insight, he fully understood how his three subordinates had died and how the Great Elder had lost an arm.

It was because the transmission had been interfered with!

Spatial Force is profound and unfathomable, yet terrifyingly powerful. What end could there be when a transmission is disturbed during transit?

No wonder the Great Elder had anxiously pulled him out of the Space Array—he had already sensed something amiss.

Had that not been the case, Qu Zheng would likely have met the same fate as those three subordinates, with only half his body remaining on the array.

Realizing this, Qu Zheng broke out in a sweat.

Yang Kai felt some annoyance—he had detected the Space Array's activation earlier and rushed here in haste; his timing had been good, but in the end Qu Zheng had escaped death by a hair.

Mo Xiaosheng was indeed capable—had he not noticed, Qu Zheng would have certainly perished.

But that did not matter; now that Yang Kai had arrived, no one in this place would be allowed to escape.

Yang Kai understood the logic of not letting a wounded snake live—he would finish the job.

He looked indifferently at the few people in the chamber; alone yet unafraid, he remained composed.

With a wave of his hand, the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao appeared before him, shouldering the huge Heaven-Shaking Pillar. Its eyes rolled, and it looked ready to spring into mischief.

The enormous Heaven-Shaking Pillar contrasted comically with Xiaoxiao's small body, creating an oddly ridiculous sight.

Yet no one dared belittle Xiaoxiao even a little; even Qu Zheng frowned—he sensed from Xiaoxiao a pressure beyond imagination, a pressure he had not even felt when facing Yang Kai.
