## Chapter 2144 — The Might of the Incarnation

"Master!" Liu Yan let out a sigh of relief when she saw Yang Kai finally arrive. Her massive body flickered, reverting to human form, and she stood respectfully behind him.

Yang Kai glanced over at Zhang Ruoxi, seeing her wrapped in a barrier of black flames. Within those flames, he sensed a familiar and intimidating aura, and immediately understood that Liu Yan was using her greatest strength to protect Zhang Ruoxi. If not for this, even if Liu Yan was no match for the three enemies, she wouldn’t have been so battered from the start.

"You did very well. Thank you for your hard work," Yang Kai nodded.

"It was my duty," Liu Yan replied calmly.

Yang Kai turned his head again, his cold gaze sweeping over the three people below.

"Who are you!" Huagu, who had nearly suffered a great loss at Yang Kai’s hands just now, shouted indignantly. "Why are you ruining our plans?"

Yang Kai smirked and said, "Are you deaf? Didn’t you hear how she addressed me just now?"

Huagu frowned and said, "So, you’re the master of this Artifact Spirit?"

"At least you’re not completely stupid!" Yang Kai sneered.

"Insolence!" Huagu roared angrily, his tone fierce. "A mere piece of trash at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm dares to possess such an Artifact Spirit? Boy, I advise you to hand it over obediently, and perhaps I’ll spare your life. Otherwise..."

"Otherwise what?"

"Today, this will be your burial ground!" Huagu shouted harshly.

"Hahahaha!" Yang Kai couldn’t help but burst out laughing, his laughter wild and arrogant, as if he didn’t take his opponents seriously at all. After a while, his smile faded and he suddenly said in a deep voice, "If that’s how you want it... then die!"

As soon as he finished speaking, Yang Kai waved his hand.

With that movement a strange pressure descended from the sky. The canyon below, already dimly lit, grew even darker, as if something had blocked out the light from above.

Huagu and the others looked up in astonishment, and in the next moment, they all cried out in shock.

"What the hell is that!"

"This is..."

"Not good, dodge!"

The three shouted as they scattered to both sides.

Boom...

The ground shook violently. A gigantic figure suddenly fell from the sky, smashing into the earth and shattering it. The massive being looked like a humanoid monster, seven or eight stories tall, its whole body made of solid stone with sharp, angular features...

Huagu and the others were dumbfounded.

With all their experience, the three couldn’t tell what this thing was at first glance. It looked somewhat like the legendary Stone Demon, but upon closer inspection, it was clearly not.

After all, even a Stone Demon couldn’t possibly be this huge!

"Oh? You finally let me out?" The Incarnation appeared, shaking its head and swinging its arms, looking like it hadn’t stretched in years and was starved for fresh air.

In fact, that was exactly the case.

Ever since the day the Incarnation devoured the Floating Continent, after Yang Kai and it joined forces to deal with the master of Purple Star, he had kept it inside the Xuan Realm Pearl. For all these years, the Incarnation had never left the Xuan Realm Pearl.

After all, its body was formed by fusing an entire continent, making it truly enormous.

If Yang Kai wanted to summon it from the Small Xuan Realm, he had to expend a tremendous amount of Divine Sense. In the midst of battle, how could he spare the effort to summon the Incarnation? He could only let it stay inside.

As time passed, the unique physique of the Stone Puppet race gradually showed its benefits. The Incarnation continuously tempered its body, removing impurities and slowly shrinking its massive form.

But it still wasn’t at the point where it could be summoned at will.

The appearance of the Heaven Devouring Battle Art was a turning point. This technique was practically tailor-made for the Incarnation. Since cultivating it, and combining it with the Stone Puppet clan’s innate abilities, the Incarnation’s body had improved greatly in a very short time.

Even so, to humans, it was still a colossal being. After summoning it, Yang Kai felt that nearly a third of his Divine Sense was instantly consumed.

Visually overwhelming, its bizarre appearance left Huagu and the other two stunned, as if in a dream, unable to believe their eyes.

As the Incarnation warmed up, fragments of stone kept falling from its body, clattering to the ground.

There was no need for Yang Kai to explain anything. As soon as the Incarnation appeared, it immediately understood the situation and knew that Huagu and the others were enemies.

It grinned at the dumbfounded Huagu and said in a booming voice, "Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, huh? To be the first in so many years to die by my hand isn’t too shameful!"

"Alright, I’ll leave it to you. I’m curious to see what kind of abilities you have now!" Yang Kai nodded calmly.

"There’ll be a surprise!" The Incarnation grinned. As it spoke, it suddenly bent its waist and punched at Huagu.

That fist didn’t seem to carry any energy—just a straightforward blow—but the force it stirred up swept toward Huagu like a hurricane, threatening to swallow him whole.

Huagu was terrified and cried out, "Are you kidding me!"

He didn’t dare be careless, leaping into the air in an instant.

Although his cultivation was strong, at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, he didn’t dare take a direct hit from such a giant.

The Incarnation’s huge body made it a bit clumsy, but it seemed to have anticipated this. The moment Huagu leapt into the air, its other hand clenched into a fist and smashed upward.

Huagu let out another strange cry and hurriedly dodged.

The situation instantly became overwhelmingly one-sided.

After dodging the Incarnation’s attacks several times, Huagu calmed down, thinking the giant stone man looked impressive but its attacks were simple and easy to avoid.

Just as this thought crossed his mind, the Incarnation suddenly snorted and said, "Jumping around like a flea. If you’re a man, fight me head-on!"

Huagu shouted, "Do you take me for a fool? You actually have the nerve to say something so childish?"

“Heh…” The Incarnation bared its teeth in a grin. “Whether it works or not—no harm in giving it a try. Since that’s how it is, then…”

As it spoke, it flipped its hand, palm facing down. A strange power surged out, and the earth and stones on the ground rolled and tumbled, quickly gathering in its palm. In the blink of an eye, a long spear appeared in the Incarnation’s hand.

The spear was formed entirely from the canyon’s stones and earth, but looked solid and indestructible, clearly strengthened by the Incarnation’s power.

With the spear in hand, combined with its massive body, the Incarnation looked truly imposing and unstoppable.

It gripped the spear and thrust it fiercely toward Huagu’s direction.

Whoosh...

A sharp sound tore through the air as a huge vortex appeared in the void, a rift ripped open by the immense force. This strike seemed to ignore the barriers of space, arriving directly in front of Huagu.

Huagu’s eyes widened in terror. In his panic, he opened his mouth and summoned a round shield-shaped Secret Treasure, which turned into a curtain of light to block in front of him.

Boom...

The spear struck the light curtain with unstoppable momentum, shattering it completely and driving into the canyon wall.

An even louder crash rang out as stones tumbled down. Where the spear struck, a huge round pit appeared in the rock.

Cold sweat poured down Huagu’s face as he hid to the side, his heart groaning in despair...

If he hadn’t dodged in time, that terrifying blow would have pulverized him.

That round shield was a Middle-Level Dao Origin-Grade defensive Secret Treasure that had followed him for countless years, earning great merit in many battles. Even Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade offensive Secret Treasures could barely leave a mark on it.

But today, it was shattered in a single blow by a strange Stone Giant.

A Middle-Level Dao Origin-Grade defensive Secret Treasure was no different from paper.

The most crucial thing was that the spear was formed entirely from earth and stone, and Huagu had seen the whole process with his own eyes.

With such absurd attacks, how could he possibly win this fight?

At this moment, Huagu couldn’t help but feel the urge to retreat, while also feeling deep regret.

When Yang Kai first appeared, he should have realized that fighting with a disciple from a great sect would never end well. Even if their cultivation was lower, they would always have powerful trump cards and Secret Treasures bestowed by their elders. None of them could be underestimated.

But he had been blinded by greed and desire, and Yang Kai’s First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation made him underestimate him. Now it was too late for regrets.

"Why is your face so pale? Where’s your courage from just now?" The Incarnation’s mocking voice rang out. Huagu looked over and felt his legs go weak.

He saw the Incarnation holding both hands down, as earth and stones rolled and squirmed on the ground, quickly forming two more spears just like before...

Meanwhile, Liu Yan and Xiong Ning had already started fighting.

Liu Yan, who had been besieged by the three earlier and forced into a disadvantage, was now full of pent-up anger. So, while the Incarnation was dealing with Huagu, she went after Xiong Ning.

Even though Xiong Ning’s cultivation was a stage higher than hers, Liu Yan still fought him to a standstill, gaining a slight upper hand.

This time, Liu Yan didn’t reveal her true form, fighting in human form!

In this form, Liu Yan could only use eighty percent of her strength. It was clear that if she really let loose and revealed her true body, she could definitely suppress Xiong Ning.

After all, Liu Yan had absorbed so many Heavenly Fires, and the advancement of an Artifact Spirit was extremely difficult—much harder than for human cultivators. Special beings like Liu Yan, born of the world’s fortune, often had the ability to fight across realms.

It was only natural that Xiong Ning was no match for her.

At the bottom of the canyon, two battlefields raged fiercely.

Yang Kai didn’t move, nor did Zhou An.

Yang Kai stayed still because he wanted to see what surprise the Incarnation would show, and also to guard Zhang Ruoxi in case the Incarnation’s actions disturbed her cultivation.
