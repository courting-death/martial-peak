## Chapter 234 — Liuyan Liquid

After Qi Jianxing's death, a blood pearl quickly formed. It was about the same size as the one that appeared after the death of the person from Ghost King Valley.

After all, they were both young martial artists in the True Yuan Realm, and the gap in strength was not too significant.

Yang Kai gasped for breath as he stored the blood pearl away, then began to search Qi Jianxing's body. In a short while, he found several blood pearls of varying sizes, which should be the spoils from Qi Jianxing's previous battles, yet he had not consumed them.

In addition, there were some silver notes and a completely green bottle.

This was all he had obtained.

He stored everything into his Spatial Pouch and quickly left the scene.

Half a day later, in a cave within a mountain, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, having consumed several Healing Pills and changed out of his blood-stained clothes to eliminate any possible traces of blood.

This cave was one he had dug himself. After learning that those from Tianlang Kingdom could enslave Demonic Beasts to fight, Yang Kai realized he needed to be more cautious in his future actions. He dug out a cave to hide in while healing, sealing the entrance to avoid any potential troubles.

The battle with Qi Jianxing had left him with injuries that were neither light nor heavy. However, Yang Kai's current strength and recovery ability had greatly improved compared to before, and he would not need many days to fully recover, especially with the assistance of Healing Pills.

In just three days, the three blood holes on his body had mostly healed. Although not completely, they no longer bled. During these three days, Yang Kai had been reflecting on his battle with Qi Jianxing, analyzing his arrogant defeat and seeking to identify the shortcomings of others through self-reflection.

He had gained a lot!

After opening his eyes, he felt a sense of joy throughout his body. A full-force battle brought a pleasant feeling.

He needed to replenish the Yang Liquid in his Dantian. Fortunately, his Master Ling Taixu had left several bottles of Yang attribute Pills in his Spatial Pouch, so he did not have to worry about this.

After consuming an entire bottle of Yang Liquid, he had only managed to produce a dozen or so drops.

Now that his Yuan Qi was more refined, the energy required to condense a drop of Yang Liquid had increased significantly compared to before, which was a good thing.

After some thought, Yang Kai swallowed the remaining bottles of Yang attribute Pills, finally causing the quantity of Yang Liquid to surge.

Searching through his Spatial Pouch, Yang Kai took out a green bottle.

This bottle was taken from Qi Jianxing, but he had no idea what it contained.

Upon opening the bottle, a wave of intense heat surged forth, a sensation that was both familiar and slightly alarming to Yang Kai.

He could clearly sense the energy contained within this bottle was pure and rich. Although it bore some resemblance to the energy in his Yang attribute Yuan Qi, it was not entirely the same.

Looking down, Yang Kai saw a liquid within the bottle that resembled colored glaze, displaying a fiery hue.

There were only four or five drops at most.

Qi Jianxing had nothing else on him, but he had treasured this bottle, which must be of considerable value.

But what exactly was this thing? Yang Kai looked around, sniffing curiously.

“Di Mo!” Yang Kai called out.

“Ah, old servant is here,” Di Mo replied, sounding quite sycophantic.

“Take a look at this. Do you recognize it?” Yang Kai asked.

Di Mo coughed a few times, awkwardly.

“Forget it…” Yang Kai thought to himself, knowing Di Mo was likely clueless again.

This old demon had a muddled memory; sometimes he could be quite useful, while other times he was utterly useless, something Yang Kai had long since grown accustomed to.

If Di Mo truly recognized this item, he would have jumped at the chance to prove his knowledge without waiting for Yang Kai to ask.

After sniffing for a while, Yang Kai felt that this thing should be non-toxic. After discussing it with Di Mo, he shared the same sentiment.

However, Yang Kai still felt a bit uneasy. He rushed out from his secluded spot and searched for a long time before finding a lone Fourth-Tier Demonic Beast. Without hesitation, he gave it a thorough beating, knocking it unconscious, and then brought it back to the cave.

On the way back, he plucked a piece of dry grass and carefully dipped it into the liquid from the bottle, then placed it into the Demonic Beast's mouth.

He quietly waited and observed.

In just a short moment, the Demonic Beast let out a piercing howl, as if it had been poisoned, convulsing violently, foam spewing from its mouth, its body flickering erratically.

Yang Kai's expression turned serious, secretly glad he hadn't taken the risk of trying it himself; otherwise, he might not even know how he would die.

Just as Yang Kai was thinking this, the Fourth-Tier Demonic Beast suddenly emitted a surge of powerful energy fluctuations, and it broke free from Yang Kai's grasp, roaring fiercely as it began to battle him within the cave.

In this state, it no longer resembled a poisoned creature at all!

After a fierce battle, Yang Kai killed it in a fit of rage!

Staring at the corpse of the Demonic Beast in a daze, Yang Kai felt puzzled.

Before he brought it back, it was clearly just a Fourth-Tier Demonic Beast, and he had easily knocked it out. But why did it feel so much stronger just now? It seemed to possess the strength of a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast.

While he was still in doubt, a blood pearl quietly formed.

Yang Kai focused his gaze and stared for a long time, his expression shifting between dark and light, before he couldn't help but curse loudly!

“Young master, please calm down…” Di Mo quickly spoke up to comfort him.

The reason for Yang Kai's anger was not without cause; he had already guessed what the green bottle contained.

The evidence was the blood pearl that formed after the Demonic Beast's death!

This blood pearl was the size of a pinky nail. Although it was not as large as the blood pearl from a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, it was much larger than that of a Fourth-Tier Demonic Beast.

To allow a Fourth-Tier Demonic Beast to grow to nearly Fifth-Tier in such a short time, the liquid within that bottle was clearly a treasure!

Recalling what he had heard over half a year ago and comparing it to the form and color of the liquid in the bottle, Yang Kai felt a wave of regret wash over him.

Liuyan Liquid!

A heaven-and-earth treasure for refining Yuan Qi, capable of making Yuan Qi more pure and concentrated.

In this world, there were not many things that could refine a martial artist's Yuan Qi, so each was worth its weight in gold. For example, Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew was one of the high-end existences among them.

And this Liuyan Liquid was no different.

When he had heard the elder from Yingyue Sect mention Liuyan Liquid by the lake, Yang Kai had not been too moved because he already possessed Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew and felt no need to covet more. But now, having fortuitously obtained Liuyan Liquid, the situation was different.

Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew could be saved for when he advanced to the True Yuan RealmLiuyan Liquid could be used right now; using both would surely yield better results.

Unfortunately, such a treasure had allowed a Demonic Beast to absorb half a drop, causing Yang Kai to feel heartache, liver pain, lung pain… every part of him ached.

At this point, regret was useless. While lamenting the good fortune of the people from Jiu Xing Sword Sect, he sat down cross-legged.

Carefully, he drew a drop of Liuyan Liquid from the bottle and swallowed it, quickly closing his eyes, focusing his mind, and entering a meditative state!

As the True Yang Technique began to operate, Yang Kai felt a burning sensation spreading from his abdomen. Those who practiced Yang attribute or fire attribute techniques generally would not experience such a feeling.

This indicated just how intense the energy contained in Liuyan Liquid was.

The burning sensation was initially not very strong, but as time passed, Yang Kai soon felt as if he were in a furnace, the heat overwhelming him, causing the new clothes he had just put on to be drenched in sweat.

This intense burning sensation lingered for a moment in his lower abdomen, then, under the guidance of the True Yang Technique, surged towards his limbs and bones.

His meridians throbbed with pain! Yang Kai gritted his teeth, daring not to slacken for a moment, and the technique's operation accelerated.

This heat felt as if it could burn through the heavens, like magma capable of incinerating the earth, coursing through his meridians while refining the Yuan Qi within.

After several cycles of the technique, Yang Kai suddenly discovered that his previously compressed and refined Yuan Qi had become even purer.

His spirit jolted, and he focused even more.

Moments later, the Yuan Qi in his meridians reached its limit and could no longer become more refined. Yang Kai guided the energy of the Liuyan Liquid into his Dantian.

In his Dantian, there were nearly a hundred drops of Yang Liquid available for refining.

Time slowly passed. A few days later, Yang Kai opened his eyes, his gaze shining brightly as he involuntarily took a deep breath: “Refreshing!”

A drop of Liuyan Liquid had refined his entire Yuan Qi once again. The hundred drops of Yang Liquid had decreased by a dozen, but each drop now contained significantly more energy than before.

Not only had his Yuan Qi changed, but even his meridians and flesh had undergone subtle transformations.

His meridians had become more resilient and broader, while his flesh had become solid and taut. Every inch of skin and every cell felt invigorated, rejuvenated from the inside out.

Originally at the Seventh Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, he had solidified his strength considerably, and he was not far from the Eighth Stage of Separation and Union!

This was the effect of refining Yuan Qi; sometimes, breakthroughs in cultivation did not solely rely on increasing the energy within the body!

“Di Mo, do you think if I consume another drop of Liuyan Liquid, I might directly break through?” Yang Kai felt a surge of eagerness.

Although Di Mo was sometimes unreliable, he provided valuable experience now: “Probably not. The fact that it has refined your Yuan Qi to this extent is already the maximum effect of this heaven-and-earth treasure. Such things do not work better the more you consume. To refine further, you would need to find even better and higher-grade treasures.”

“I think so too.” Yang Kai put away his thoughts and solemnly stuffed the green bottle into his Spatial Pouch.

He wondered where the people from Jiu Xing Sword Sect had found the Liuyan Liquid. Qi Jianxing had a few drops on him; what about Wu Chengyi? He probably had even more, right?

Thinking of this, Yang Kai couldn't help but chuckle coldly.

Wu Chengyi had sent Qi Jianxing to hunt him down; how could Yang Kai let this go easily? There was already enmity, and now knowing the other party possessed a precious treasure, it would be strange if Yang Kai did not target him.

However, Wu Chengyi was too strong, and he was also the temporary leader of that group of martial artists. If he were to fall out with him now, there would be no good outcome. This matter could only be plotted slowly.

Regaining his composure, Yang Kai broke through the barrier and emerged.

For an entire month, Yang Kai hunted Demonic Beasts in foreign lands. Throughout this month of wandering, he encountered no one else. However, the number of Demonic Beasts he found was exceedingly low. It seemed that what Chen Xueshu had told him that day was indeed true; most of the Demonic Beasts in these foreign lands had already been enslaved by the people of Tianlang Kingdom!
