## Chapter 1567 — Commotion at the City Gate

Not far from the gate of Huiyue City, there was a teahouse.

Positioned well, with a clear view of the comings and goings at the gate, Yang Kai had been coming early and leaving late, staking out this teahouse for several days in a row, yet he had not seen any of the palace maidservants appear.

One day, just as he was bored and sipping his fragrant tea, a sudden commotion rose from the direction of the city gate.

The warriors who had been lining up to enter the city all parted to either side of the road at once, as if to make way for some noble Lord or Lady, and shouts mixed through the crowd; Yang Kai vaguely heard cries like "They're here! They're here!"

Could it be the palace maidservants? Yang Kai's spirit stirred and he naturally assumed so.

The agitation at the city gate spread to the teahouse; the warriors drinking inside came out in turn and gathered toward the street. In no time the broad avenue was lined with people on both sides, all staring toward the city gate.

Though many in number, they were as silent as crows, eerily quiet.

Yang Kai stepped out of the teahouse as well, squeezed into the crowd and peered toward the gate, his face expectant, planning to find a suitable person to present his request and have them deliver his message.

The ground shuddered faintly; the solid earth transmitted distant tremors as though an army of a thousand horses were thundering this way.

Yang Kai frowned and suddenly realized matters might not be as he had imagined; after all, if it were merely palace maidservants out buying supplies, there wouldn't be such a grand show.

Besides, since those maidservants came out once every month, the residents and warriors of Huiyue City should be used to it, not prone to such spectacle.

Realizing this, he felt a touch disappointed — it seemed the palace maidservants had not appeared.

Still, he was very curious: who exactly had come to Huiyue City to draw such interest from so many warriors?

Shortly after, a majestic wolf-shaped demonic beast suddenly leapt in from outside, and atop its back sat a yao warrior whose face Yang Kai found rather familiar.

"Move aside! Move aside! Everyone, move aside!" The yao warrior called loudly as he strode into Huiyue City, cracking a long whip in his hand to drive the onlookers farther away and clear a wider path.

Behind him followed a dozen or so similarly sized wolf-type demonic beasts, each ridden by a yao warrior. They spread themselves to the sides and formed orderly ranks, standing at attention.

Isn't this the yao troupe he questioned a few days ago? Yang Kai looked at the lead warrior and quickly recalled.

"Friend, which Lord or Lady is arriving in Huiyue City with such a procession?" a voice nearby asked; the speaker was clearly puzzled and was asking those beside him for news.

"Don't know," replied the questioned man as he craned his neck to look, equally curious.

"Then why are you looking?" the asker retorted, displeased.

"Exactly because I don't know, that's why I'm looking — aren't you?"

"Ahem…"

While the crowd whispered and puzzled over the matter, two enormous heads suddenly poked out at the gate. Each bore a single horn, jet-black in color, their skulls armored with hard scales and eyes like snake pupils that glinted with a cold light, chilling to behold.

“This is…” Someone knowledgeable cried out in surprise, having already recognized what these two Demonic Beasts truly were.

The full forms of the two demonic beasts were soon revealed: besides their huge heads, each bore a pair of wings, their bodies covered in scales like a dragon's, and long tails swung behind them, exuding raw, explosive power.

"Ninth-Tier demonic beasts — Thunderflame Flying Lizards!"

Not all demonic beasts can assume human form; some remain beasts their entire lives. These Ninth-Tier Thunderflame Flying Lizards were clearly such creatures. Among Ninth-Tier demonic beasts, they were notorious, naturally adept at commanding thunder and fire, vicious and cruel in temperament; even a cultivator at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would flee before them.

Few experts possessed the strength to tame such beasts.

Yet now these two Thunderflame Flying Lizards had been reduced to draft animals, yoked by reins about their necks. Behind them a sumptuous carriage, decorated to the utmost, slowly rolled into Huiyue City.

The carriage's interior overflowed with luxury, tastefully adorned; as the wheels turned, a clear, tinkling chime emanated from within, delightfully melodious.

The carriage was wide open without doors or windows, only some pink curtains hanging about, suggesting the owner of the beast-carriage enjoyed being the center of attention.

Three people sat inside the carriage, but in that instant nearly everyone's eyes were fixed on a single figure.

It was a man dressed in a pristine white robe, lounging lazily upon a soft couch. Handsome and elegant as jade, his very posture exuded effortless nobility—so much so that anyone before him would unconsciously feel diminished.

At first glance he seemed merely handsome; look a second time and one would be sunk in his gaze.

His eyes were bright and spirited and seemed to emit a strange power; any woman meeting that gaze would unconsciously lose herself, like a moth drawn to a flickering lamp, heedless of consequence.

A peerless beauty half-prostrated herself on his knees; the man's slender, exquisite hand gently caressed her black hair. The woman narrowed her eyes slightly, wearing an expression of exquisite indulgence, as if she were a pet relishing her master's affection.

Another woman lay slantwise in the man's embrace, equally dreamy-eyed, her cheeks flushed as if freshly bathed in dew, breathing softly, her red lips exuding a bewitching allure.

Though watched by countless onlookers, the man still smiled, his eyes filled with an uncanny power as he glanced about. Any woman who met his gaze felt her heart leap, aching to rush up to that carriage and be with him, offering her body and soul.

"I know who he is — he's the Evil-Eyed Young Master! He's Mi Tian, the son of the Thousand-Eyed Lord!" a cry rang out in the crowd, revealing the noble identity of the man in the beast-carriage.

Many recognized him.

The faces of numerous men turned pale; they looked at Mi Tian with changed expressions, filled with dread.

No wonder — the Evil-Eyed Young Master, Mi Tian, bore an utterly vile reputation across Emperor Chen Star. It was said that the women who perished by his hand numbered if not a thousand, then at least eight hundred. And yet, he had neither forced nor personally slain them; rather, those women had willingly offered up their lives to him.

Rumor said Mi Tian cultivated a secret art tinged with yin absorption and yang replenishment; after a night with him, even a magnificent woman would wither away and die.

Even so, more women still threw themselves into Mi Tian's embrace without hesitation.

What made it worse was that Mi Tian would indiscriminately seduce women of both human and yao lineages.

Many women were poisoned by him in this way, so normally wherever Mi Tian went men would keep their women indoors, doing their utmost to prevent them from encountering him.

Previously no one had heard Mi Tian would come to Huiyue City, so no precautions had been taken; had they known, they would have avoided him like the plague instead of lining the roads to welcome him.

But now, with a beast-carriage drawn by two Ninth-Tier Thunderflame Flying Lizards, Mi Tian had appeared before them; how could they make him leave?

"Damn it!" Many warriors looked at the beloved women beside them and, seeing the admiration and love for Mi Tian in their eyes, wished they could tear the bastard to pieces.

But that was only wishful thinking.

For one, Mi Tian himself was an expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; few could match him. Even putting that aside, those two Ninth-Tier demonic beasts drawing his carriage were not to be trifled with.

Moreover, Mi Tian had a powerful backing.

The Thousand-Eyed Lord!

He was a true regional power, a Void King Realm expert. Who in their right mind would dare harm his son? The Thousand-Eyed Lord doted on him; otherwise he would never have allowed Thunderflame Flying Lizards to be used as draft animals.

Standing in the crowd, Yang Kai learned this man's identity from the surrounding exclamations and murmurs and felt a bit puzzled — why would the Thousand-Eyed Lord's young son come all the way to Red Moon Domain?

As far as he knew, the relations among the ten great lords on the Imperial Star were not particularly harmonious.

But he did not ponder deeply; upon learning the source of the commotion was not the palace maidservants he had been waiting for, he had no desire to watch the spectacle.

He disliked the Evil-Eyed Young Master's stare — it was the arrogance of a man who thought all the world's women belonged to him.

He had intended to turn and leave, but when he recovered his senses he froze.

All those standing along the street had dropped to one knee, bowing respectfully to welcome Mi Tian’s arrival in the city.

Yang Kai looked around and involuntarily frowned.

He suddenly realized he stood out like a crane among chickens…

Of all the onlookers, everyone else was half-kneeling; Yang Kai alone remained standing, making him particularly conspicuous.

Mi Tian's eyes turned his way, his chin lifted slightly; though seated in the beast-carriage he looked down upon Yang Kai with contempt, his gaze suffused with oppressive force.

"How dare you!" an angry roar came from the side. The yao warrior who had ridden the wolf beast that escorted Mi Tian into the city tightened his reins; the mount lunged before Yang Kai, and a long whip cracked out as he scolded, "Kneel down this instant!"

With that he lashed out at Yang Kai, seemingly intent on teaching him a lesson.

Yang Kai stared at him with a calm, indifferent expression.

The yao warrior paused, then suddenly recognized Yang Kai's face — wasn't this the human warrior who had asked him for directions a few days ago?

He had thought the man somewhat inscrutable at the time…
