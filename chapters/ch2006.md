## Chapter 2006 — Heavy Earth

The Star Realm was vast, and there were countless perilous places.

Not only in the Star Realm, but even within the Star Domain, there were such natural gravity fields.

In certain spots the gravity was several times, even a dozen times stronger than normal, often catching people off guard and causing great losses.

But the natural gravity field here was even more terrifying; it had pinned Yang Kai, a Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivator, in place so he could not move—one could imagine how tremendous its power was.

It was, without doubt, thousands upon thousands of times the gravity of an ordinary place.

Natural gravity fields were extremely rare and formed only under very harsh conditions. Yang Kai had encountered them before, but those he could break free from by exerting a little force; however, this place...

His expression gradually turned grave as he continuously urged his inner strength, yet he could only crawl forward slowly; flying was completely impossible.

Looking up, a sliver of sky was visible at an unknown height. From such a great distance, without the ability to fly, there was simply no way to reach it.

After scanning the surroundings again, Yang Kai's eyes narrowed slightly.

The gorge was actually not long, only about one hundred zhang, yet beneath this one hundred zhang gorge lay piled white bones — some the size of demonic beasts, others humanoid. Most had been smashed to pieces and lay scattered, with only a very few barely retaining their original shapes.

There was even a corpse that had clearly not been dead long; the nearby blood had not yet dried, flesh lay in tatters across the ground, and entrails were splattered far and wide — a sight too gruesome to behold.

This person was obviously a martial artist from Fenglin City who had entered the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda this time, just like Yang Kai. While flying over the gorge they had been pulled down; lacking Yang Kai's means, they ultimately ended up smashed into pulp.

He must have been extremely unwilling before dying...

Yang Kai thought inwardly; after all, they had both cultivated to the Void King Realm — who would have expected to one day fall to their death in some place like this? If that death were spread about, people would surely laugh themselves hoarse.

But why was the gravity here so horrifying? Yang Kai was at a loss; he had encountered natural gravity fields before, yet none could be compared to this place.

Forced to act, he deployed the Undying Five Elements Sword, wrapping himself in five-colored radiance. After a moment he also performed the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, finally allowing himself to move beneath the gorge at a turtle's pace.

After half a cup of tea, Yang Kai dispelled the Undying Five Elements Sword and the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, panting heavily, and collapsed onto the ground.

Sustaining those two secret techniques for so long had greatly drained him, and the gains had been negligible — not worth the expenditure — so he stopped wasting his strength.

"Won't I be trapped and die in this damned place?" that sorrowful thought surfaced in Yang Kai's mind.

After a moment, he frowned again, and an expression of extreme astonishment crossed his face.

"No — the Spiritual Qi here..."

He suddenly discovered that the Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Qi here was exceptionally dense.

He had no idea how extraordinarily thick the Spiritual Qi could be in the finest grotto paradises of the Star Realm; after all, he'd only just arrived in the Star Realm and had never been to the main headquarters of any great sect.

Yet the Spiritual Qi here was by no means comparable to the main headquarters of the Biyu Sect, nor could it be compared to the cave-dwelling he rented in Fenglin City.

The richness of the Spiritual Qi here far exceeded what Yang Kai could imagine.

Sitting there without needing to circulate his power, the surrounding Spiritual Qi flowed into his body on its own, and before long the energy he had expended earlier was restored.

When something strays so far from the norm, there must be something amiss. Ever since entering the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, Yang Kai had felt the surrounding Spiritual Qi to be exceedingly sparse—whether on the first layer or the second, it had been the same. For such a dense pocket of Spiritual Qi to suddenly appear here, it was impossible not to take notice.

Moreover, because of that terrifying natural gravity field, all the Spiritual Qi had been sucked and held tightly within a space less than three chi above the ground, unable to spread.

This created a strange sight: beneath the gorge, in the band three chi above the ground, the Spiritual Qi was as thick as a heavy mist, even beginning to show signs of condensing into threads.

Earlier, after his recent upheaval, Yang Kai had not paid much attention; now, upon close inspection, he was greatly startled.

Could there be some treasure buried underground?

The thought rose unbidden in Yang Kai's mind; only such a conjecture could explain the oddities of this place.

Thinking that, Yang Kai could not help but grow excited.

He forced himself to his feet, urged his inner power, pressed his five fingers together, and dozens of Golden Blood Threads leisurely emerged, twisting together and gradually taking the form of a drill.

At Yang Kai's soft shout, the drill formed by the Golden Blood Threads spun and struck the ground.

In the next moment, a tremendous noise resounded.

Golden light burst everywhere...

The dozens of Golden Blood Threads suddenly collapsed, reverting to their original forms and failing to maintain the drill shape, yet a spot on the ground flashed with fire and scattered sparks.

After a moment, Yang Kai widened his eyes as he stared at a rice-grain-sized pit on the ground and exclaimed, "So hard?"

He could now be certain that there was indeed a treasure underground.

The soil on the surface, by his observation, was ordinary earth, but for some reason an invisible force had rendered it hard; even the Golden Blood Threads could not deal much damage. With a full-strength strike they left only that rice-grain-sized dent, and in the blink of an eye the pit vanished.

The ground returned to smoothness!

That mysterious force even had the ability to self-repair!

Yang Kai watched, burning with desire yet helpless.

If he could not dig open the ground, he could not hope to take the treasure below; and in his present state he could not break the surface...

He had entirely fallen into a dead loop, like the old question of which came first, the chicken or the egg.

How he wished Xiaoxiao were here! Yang Kai suddenly longed for Xiaoxiao's ability — the Stone Puppet race's innate skill of devouring minerals to strengthen itself, and its capacity to traverse underground freely without restriction.

If Xiaoxiao had not been separated from him, Yang Kai could have used its power to let it bore into the earth and fetch the treasure.

Unfortunately... Yang Kai did not know where Xiaoxiao was now.

As for the Incarnation in the Xuan Realm Pearl, though it was also of the Stone Puppet clan, it was simply too large and its impurities had not yet been fully refined; Yang Kai estimated it could not perform tunneling either.

Just when he was full of disappointment, Yang Kai's eyes suddenly brightened as he thought of something.

He immediately produced the Xuan Realm Pearl, sent his Divine Sense inside, and communicated with the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat.

Since the little beast was called the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat, burrowing through earth must surely be within its abilities; if he could borrow its power...

The little beast was a Tenth-Tier demonic beast; though it did not possess human-level intellect, it was not unintelligent, and simple communication with Yang Kai was possible.

After a while, Yang Kai cautiously reached out and touched the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Light flashed, and the little beast suddenly materialized beside Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's expression turned solemn; his Divine Sense wrapped the little beast — if anything went wrong he would immediately retract it. The pressure here was too terrifying; he did not know whether a Tenth-Tier demonic beast could withstand it, and if it burst its body he could not explain it to Mo Xiaoqi.

Fortunately, matters were not as bad as he feared. After appearing the little beast showed extreme distress and pain; its whole body seemed shortened, bones creaking from within, and Xiaoxiao's eyes gradually reddened as if blood streaks had seeped out.

But after a while it seemed to adapt and it gave Yang Kai a couple of squeaks.

Yang Kai rejoiced and said, "Then it's up to you. If you feel something wrong, come back up immediately — do not force it!"

The little beast squeaked in response, then turned and sank into the ground like something falling into water.

Its speed was not fast; it took a full ten breaths before its figure gradually vanished.

Yang Kai waited anxiously in place, wanting to use Divine Sense to probe the little beast's condition, but he was completely powerless; once his consciousness left the Sea of Consciousness it was warped and pulled by that terrifying gravity, making it impossible to investigate the underground situation.

A cup of tea's time passed...

The time of an incense stick passed...

Two hours passed...

Yang Kai's expression gradually turned grim.

Just as he thought the little beast's errand might be a one-way trip, a small head suddenly popped up at his feet with extremely labored squeaks; the little beast reappeared.

Yang Kai was overjoyed and hurried to receive it.

He urgently lent his Divine Sense to envelop the little beast, bearing most of the pressure for it.

After the little beast's body fully emerged from underground, Yang Kai reached out and grabbed it; with a flick of his body he and the beast dove directly into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Somewhere inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the ground, and the little beast, panting heavily, lay on his knees as if it had endured a world-shaking battle, utterly exhausted.

"You worked hard," Yang Kai said, gently combing through its fur to comfort it.

The little beast lifted its weak eyelids, glanced at him, and then lay still.

After a long while it suddenly rose, opened its mouth, and spat out a soil-colored object about the size of a pigeon egg.

Yang Kai reached to take it; although it appeared small, the instant he received it he staggered as if a ten-thousand-pound weight had dropped into his hand, nearly toppling him forward.

Startled, he hurriedly circulated his power to steady his stance and managed to avoid an embarrassing fall.

The little beast let out a squeak, as if taking a faint, mischievous pleasure in his near-mishap.

Yang Kai ignored it and solemnly examined the irregular, soil-colored object in his hand. His expression shifted repeatedly before he finally cried out, "Heavy Earth?"

The thing the little beast had brought up from underground was indeed a piece of Heavy Earth!
