## Chapter 608 — Returns and Causes a Great Stir

The human-shaped flame burned fiercely, bearing a grotesque, distorted face; its limbs were whole, comprised purely of the essence of fire.

Intense heat swept through; Yang Kai's manor was set alight, vast swathes of houses turned to dust in that instant.

The air warped, and Yang Kai's expression grew especially grave, for from that human-shaped flame he perceived an aura of destructive brutality.

The True Spirit had already shown signs of life, but since it had not fully matured Yang Kai had prematurely separated it from the jade core; in this moment it possessed only the most primitive instincts.

Its instinct was to burn everything!

Whoosh...

A surge like a fire-dragon erupted from within the True Spirit, striking outward toward the standing Yang Kai, lightning-fast and unimaginably powerful.

Yang Kai's face changed; he hurriedly dodged, yet one of his arms was still grazed by the searing heat.

The skin on that arm, like parched earth, quickly split into cracks; pain surged, and Yang Kai could not help but emit a muffled groan.

His gaze toward the True Spirit grew ever more uncertain and suspicious.

He cultivated the True Yang Technique; the True Yang Yuan Qi within him was supremely rigid and blazing—ordinary heat could do him no harm—yet even he could not endure the temperature emanating from the True Spirit.

This heat had already exceeded a certain limit, ascending to another degree.

Before he could recover, the True Spirit attacked once more.

Throughout Yang Kai's manor there was only Yang Kai's living aura; the True Spirit's instinct to burn all drove it to make Yang Kai the target of its destruction.

Flames coalesced into dragon-like forms that swayed and shot out from the True Spirit's body, and in the blink of an eye they surrounded Yang Kai, rushing at him with dazzling speed.

Yang Kai's pupils suddenly widened; surrounded on all sides like this, he had not even the faintest hope of escape.

The Wings of Yang Flame, long unused, unfurled on his back with a sweep—fiery red like a great bird—and bore Yang Kai out of the ring of flames at a speed few could match.

Boom...

The tumultuous explosion rang out; in an instant Yang Kai's entire manor was burned flat, every dwelling gone, the ground charred. Within the enclosure of the Heavenly Journey Palace, innumerable crimson flames leapt and pursued Yang Kai without relent.

Detecting the disturbance, Zhongdu's cultivators hurried over.

When they took in the situation inside the Heavenly Journey Palace, Huo Xingchen gaped: "What is going on? Young Master Kai has been gone half a year—now he comes back and makes such a huge scene?"

Though the Heavenly Journey Palace's isolation shield prevented them from sensing any heat, the True Spirit's aura of destruction made them shiver.

"What is he doing?" Qiu Yimeng fretted, her pretty eyes burning as she peered inward; she could not make out the situation clearly, only faintly sensing Yang Kai's activity within.

That crimson, flame-like world blocked all investigation.

After quite some time, the chaotic scene gradually became clearer.

Yang Kai hung silently in midair, his look grave as he gazed downward. Below, a human-shaped flame twisted and burned, bellowing ferocious roars from its mouth.

"My heavens..." Huo Xingchen was dumbstruck, staring blankly at the birdlike wings behind Yang Kai, momentarily dazed.

Everyone was stunned.

No one had known Yang Kai possessed such reserve; since the Succession War he had never once deployed the Wings of Yang Flame.

"So beautiful!" Luo Xiaoman murmured, a little lovestruck, a strange light in her eyes as she gazed unblinkingly at the wings behind Yang Kai.

"Is that... the True Spirit?" Tang Yuxian's face drained as she cried out.

Tu Feng's expression also turned extremely grim; his gaze burned as he stared at that human-shaped flame.

The two exchanged a look and at once understood what Yang Kai was up against.

"What True Spirit?" Qiu Yimeng asked anxiously.

Tang Yuxian quickly recounted what had happened at the Lü family to Qiu Yimeng; upon hearing it, Qiu Yimeng's memory returned.

When Yang Kai had carried Lü Si's Yang Crystal Jade Bed back, Qiu Yimeng had seen it with her own eyes—only she had not realized Yang Kai had obtained such a dangerous treasure from that bed.

"This is not something an ordinary person can handle!" Tu Feng frowned; even now that he had advanced to the Transcendent Realm, across the Heavenly Journey Palace the True Spirit pressed upon him with immense force.

If one truly charged in, Tu Feng estimated he would likely be burned to death by the flames.

"It seems the young master intends to absorb the True Spirit's power to strengthen himself," Tang Yuxian said, biting her red lips. "But this is far too reckless."

She blamed herself, feeling she had failed to explain things clearly to Yang Kai before, thereby letting him mistakenly believe that with his current strength he had a chance to subdue the True Spirit.

"Can we go help?" Qiu Yimeng asked, her face anxious.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian slowly shook their heads. "That kind of temperature is beyond our endurance. The young master is safe inside precisely because his cultivation method shares the same attribute."

Besides, they could not enter the Heavenly Journey Palace.

Qiu Yimeng, anxious from concern, had entirely forgotten that point.

"You lot..." Huo Xingchen suddenly laughed and shook his head, his eyes deep and full of meaning. "Having been with Young Master Kai so long, you still don't know his character? He wouldn't do something he had no confidence in. If he dares to do this, he surely has some assurance—let us only watch."

Hearing him, everyone brightened.

Indeed, Yang Kai never acted so recklessly; he always planned before he moved, and facts often proved his decisions right.

Now worrying for him was useless; it was better to trust that he had his reasons for acting as he did.

"What if..." Qiu Yimeng still felt uneasy.

"If it fails, Young Master Kai can still escape. Didn't you see he deliberately chose the location inside the Heavenly Journey Palace? It must be to prevent excessive harm to Zhongdu," Huo Xingchen said with knowing confidence.

His analysis sounded plausible, leaving no grounds for rebuttal.

Inside the Heavenly Journey Palace, Yang Kai stared at the human-shaped flame below, repeatedly sending with his Divine Sense the thought of submitting to him.

To absorb the True Spirit's power, he had to force it into submission.

But that savage, destructive instinct made the True Spirit only grow more frenzied when confronted with Yang Kai's coaxing and commands.

Torrents of scorching flame erupted, filling every corner of the Heavenly Journey Palace, blooming like a field of fire.

Yang Kai snorted coldly. The Wings of Yang Flame beat as he darted in and out of the flames like a rider glancing over scenery, swiftly arriving at a certain spot in the estate.

This place had once been Su Yan's room.

But after the True Spirit's devastation, the site had already been flattened.

Arriving there, Yang Kai stopped and stamped the ground viciously, cracking a hole; he dove in and returned moments later, hoisting aloft a massive ice bed that exhaled visible tendrils of bitter cold from its edges.

Su Yan's Ten-Thousand-Year Cold Ice Bed!

She had long relied on it for cultivation; after Shopkeeper Meng took her to foreign lands, the ice bed was left behind in the cellar below.

Ice and fire have always been opposing attributes.

Yang Kai had intended to use this bed of cold ice to counter the True Spirit's intense heat.

As if sensing its nemesis, the previously motionless True Spirit suddenly lifted its head, its grotesque eyes staring unblinkingly at the ice bed.

A ferocious blast of heat struck; the ice bed exhaled a cutting chill.

Cold and heat intermingled, erupting into a billow of white mist.

Yang Kai remained unscathed.

In this collision of ice and fire, he was merely a spectator.

A roar issued forth; the flames within the Heavenly Journey Palace were swiftly retracted into the True Spirit, which in the next moment seemed to transform into a beast unleashed after a thousand years of confinement—roaring as it charged Yang Kai, its features twisted into a terrifying, demonic visage.

Yang Kai drew a deep breath, fixed his gaze on the charging True Spirit, and instead of evading, raised the ice bed high to meet it.

"Enter Demonic State!" A dreamlike whisper sounded; the sensation of heaven and earth splitting entered everyone's hearts. Thick, malevolent demonic qi swept across the Heavenly Journey Palace, mingling with ice and fire in this realm to herald the prelude to destruction.

Outside the Heavenly Journey Palace, everyone felt their vision blur and could see nothing.

What could be seen were only three colors.

Crimson flames, pearl-white chill, and pitch-black malevolent demonic qi.

The three colors converged, making the world within the Heavenly Journey Palace resplendent and variegated.

It was plainly visible that in an instant the crimson color gained absolute advantage; the pearl-white and pitch-black lights were suppressed to near disappearance.

Everyone instinctively clenched their fists, secretly sweating for Yang Kai.

At the same time they were filled with admiration, imagining if they were in such a situation they would likely flee immediately rather than make any effort.

Yet Yang Kai persisted; the pitch-black malevolent demonic qi, however faint at times, still did not dissipate.

Gradually the red glow of the flames weakened considerably, while the pearl-white chill and the pitch-black demonic qi slowly revealed themselves.

A cheer broke out; everyone rejoiced.

The pearl-white and pitch-black lights grew ever stronger; together they gradually held their own against the crimson hue.

At that point the situation reached a stalemate, and no further change occurred.

Time flowed on—days rose and moons set—day after day.

The situation inside the Heavenly Journey Palace remained tense; the aura of destruction spread throughout Zhongdu, leaving people sleepless and uneasy.

Yet those outside Yang Kai's residence stood watching and waiting, hoping for the moment Yang Kai would emerge safely.

One day the pearl-white chill suddenly weakened greatly; no one knew why. At the same time the red light of the flames also dimmed noticeably, while the pitch-black demonic qi grew increasingly dense.

Seeing this, everyone's expressions flickered; they knew that at this moment Yang Kai had fully seized the initiative. They craned their necks in eager expectation, secretly wondering what changes would have taken place in him when he emerged this time.
