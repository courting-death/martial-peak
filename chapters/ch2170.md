## Chapter 2170 — Seize

Lan Xun's choice undoubtedly sent a different kind of signal...

Though she was unwilling to use her status to pressure others, she also didn't want to leave empty-handed. Regardless of whether those things were useful to her or not, she had made it this far by her own abilities, so she deserved a share of the spoils. With her and Xiao Chen's strength, they were absolutely qualified to seize at least one item.

But she also had no desire to truly clash with the others and fight to the death over something that was of little use to her, so she simply picked one item at random—just enough to make a token gesture.

In this way, she gave an explanation both to herself and to the others!

"Princess!" Xiao Chen called out in a low, deep voice, as if he still wanted to persuade her.

Lan Xun's expression was indifferent. She calmly said, "Brother Xiao Chen, do you want me to take it myself?"

Meeting her gaze, Xiao Chen's heart sank. He realized that if he kept pestering, he would truly make Lan Xun unhappy. Gritting his teeth, he forced a smile and said, "Then please wait a moment, Princess. I'll be right back..."

As he spoke, his figure leapt onto the high platform.

With someone taking the lead to test for danger, the others naturally widened their eyes and watched closely.

Fortunately, aside from the restrictions covering the various treasures, there were truly no traps or dangers on the high platform.

Xiao Chen stood before the Imperial Treasure shield. Though a trace of reluctance showed on his face, he could only summon his longsword, channel his Origin Qi, and slash at the inverted semicircular barrier atop the platform.

Even though he didn't use his full strength, he still put in at least half, and struck with resentment, so the power was naturally extraordinary.

The sword flashed with light and struck the barrier fiercely.

Yet the barrier was incredibly sturdy. It only dented slightly under the forceful blow, then bounced back, completely unharmed...

"Oh?" Seeing this, everyone was startled. While marveling at the strength of the restriction, they also calculated how much force would be needed to break it and seize the treasure.

Xiao Chen's sword failed to break through. Feeling a bit embarrassed, he withdrew and flicked his sword, then slowly chanted, "Plum blossoms bloom with fragrance in the snow!"

As the sword moved, plum blossoms appeared one after another.

This ultimate killing move, performed at this moment, was poetic and picturesque, truly beautiful.

A mysterious fragrance drifted over, lingering at everyone's nose. The plum blossoms suddenly turned into countless glowing lights, fiercely bombarding the barrier.

Violent tremors spread out, and the barrier flashed wildly with light.

Though its glow dimmed, there was still no sign of it breaking.

Xiao Chen's face darkened. He spun his sword again, unleashing another ultimate move: "Slanting moon commands the mirror across the sky!"

Another elegant sword technique burst forth, its wild power continuously pounding the barrier...

Crack...

Finally, cracks appeared on the barrier. Seeing this, Xiao Chen urged his Origin Qi and stabbed forward with his sword.

With a loud crash, the restriction was completely shattered. Xiao Chen grabbed the Imperial Treasure shield, leapt down gracefully to Lan Xun's side, and said, "Princess, I've got it."

"Mm." Lan Xun nodded slightly, not even glancing at the Imperial Treasure shield. Instead, she smiled at the others and said, "Well then... Lan Xun will take her leave. Good luck to you all!"

With that, she turned and walked toward the light gate standing on the right side of the hall.

Though Xiao Chen was full of reluctance, he had no choice but to follow Lan Xun closely. As he left, he glared fiercely at the others, as if to say, "You got lucky this time..."

Soon, the two from Star God Palace disappeared into the light gate, leaving no trace.

"Princess... is really quite impressive!" After a moment of silence, Kong Qi suddenly spoke.

"Indeed," Gong Wenshan nodded in agreement. "She is, after all, the daughter of a Great Emperor. Her bearing and magnanimity are beyond compare. She makes me feel ashamed..."

"You should be ashamed!" Kong Qi looked at him with a resentful expression.

Just then, a burst of laughter rang out. Bian Yuqing's beautiful eyes sparkled as she looked around and said, "Though the Princess and her attendant have left, there are still people and treasures remaining... It seems there's not enough to go around!"

There had originally been five treasures on the high platform. Now that the Imperial Treasure shield was taken, only four remained, but there were still six people...

"I want to take one first!" Luo Yuan suddenly declared in a deep voice.

Gong Wenshan glanced over and said, "Why should you?"

Kong Qi added, "If you want to seize a treasure, you have to rely on strength. I had no objection to the Princess taking one, but if you want to take one next, I have a big problem with that."

Luo Yuan was from the Eight Directions Sect, which was only a mid-tier sect in the Southern Territory. Kong Qi, on the other hand, was from the Qiyao Commerce Guild, whose backing was far weightier. Why would Kong Qi be intimidated here?

Luo Yuan smiled arrogantly, his gaze cold as he swept over the crowd. "If anyone disagrees, come and try!"

A hint of coldness appeared on Kong Qi's face. He nodded slowly and said, "Your attitude really annoys me. I want to see your skills, friend. I wonder... Hm? Bastard, what are you doing?"

Before Kong Qi could finish, his expression suddenly changed, and he shouted angrily.

The next moment, everyone was furious.

While they were arguing, Yang Kai had already moved, appearing on the high platform and slapping one of the barrier screens.

"Bold! How dare you!" Luo Yuan roared, stomping his feet and leaping forward.

Seeing this, the others didn't hesitate. They all used their movement techniques to rush forward, afraid of falling behind.

However... when Lan Xun had Xiao Chen take the Imperial Treasure shield, everyone had already decided which treasure to seize. After all, the remaining four treasures had different uses, and everyone had their own preferences.

So, as the six rushed onto the platform, their targets were completely different.

Yang Kai's target was the fiery red bead that even Lan Xun couldn't recognize and whose use was unknown.

He chose it not because he recognized it, but because of something Zhang Ruoxi had said earlier.

She had told Yang Kai that Qiong Qi said, if you ever enter the final place, you must choose the thing that seems most useless!

Of the remaining four treasures, whether it was the Imperial Aura, the Emperor Extinction Pill, or the Taiyi Divine Water, all were extremely valuable. Only the fiery red bead, since no one recognized it, seemed the most useless.

Qiong Qi was a Divine Spirit, and had even given Zhang Ruoxi a Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress. There was no reason for him to deceive her about this.

So Yang Kai's target from the start was this fiery red bead!

And his choice, intentionally or not, avoided the others—no one was interested in the bead. Though they felt it was extraordinary, without knowing its effect, seizing it rashly might not be worth it. What if it was useless?

So the other five set their sights on the remaining three treasures.

Among them, Luo Yuan and Kong Qi both targeted the Emperor Extinction Pill! Their thinking was simple. The Emperor Extinction Pill contained the full-force strike of an Emperor Realm expert, making it the strongest trump card. With it, you had the means to survive! As long as you lived, anything was possible.

As for Bian Yuqing and Gong Wenshan, they set their sights on the Imperial Aura. This was the source from which an Imperial Treasure could be refined—its worth was simply incalculable.

Murong Xiaoxiao originally wanted to seize the Emperor Extinction Pill, but seeing Luo Yuan aiming for the same, she gritted her teeth and changed direction, rushing to the Taiyi Divine Water and immediately working to break its restriction.

Xiao Baiyi had once told her, when alone, never clash with Luo Yuan, because he was dangerous—even Xiao Baiyi wasn't sure he could win!

Murong Xiaoxiao was very obedient, so she naturally wouldn't go against Xiao Baiyi's advice.

The six quickly split into several groups. Aside from Yang Kai and Murong Xiaoxiao working alone to break restrictions, the other four fought in pairs.

The struggle between Kong Qi and Luo Yuan was especially fierce. Neither would back down, and while breaking the restriction, they kept exchanging moves, making the platform a chaotic mess, Spiritual Qi surging wildly.

As for Bian Yuqing and Gong Wenshan...

Gong Wenshan truly deserved to be called a formation master. Upon landing on the platform, he immediately summoned a Formation Talisman, which spread out in ripples and turned into mist, enveloping his area and trapping Bian Yuqing as well.

No one could see what was happening inside.

However... falling into the other's Formation Talisman, Yang Kai guessed Bian Yuqing was probably powerless to turn things around, and could only silently pity her.

The scene of Xiao Chen breaking the restriction was still fresh in everyone's mind. They all knew the barrier was extremely tough and couldn't be broken easily, so now they spared no effort.

Yang Kai directly used the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique, channeling Undying Five Elements Sword Qi, his hand turning into a dragon claw, and struck fiercely at the barrier.

With no one interfering, he tried five times before finally breaking the restriction.

As the barrier shattered, Yang Kai took the fiery red bead and put it into his Spatial Ring.

He turned his head, only to see Luo Yuan and Kong Qi refusing to yield an inch—one hand braced against the other as they contested with Origin Qi beside the restriction guarding the Emperor Severing Pill, while each man’s free hand worked ceaselessly, employing his own method to unravel the barrier.

The barrier's light was visibly fading, seemingly about to be broken.

Nearby, mist shrouded Bian Yuqing and Gong Wenshan; there was no sign of them, not even a sound.

On the outer edge, Murong Xiaoxiao anxiously urged her Secret Treasure—Feathered Heaven Ring—repeatedly striking the Taiyi Divine Water's barrier.

Though she had used all her strength, it would still take a few more breaths before it broke.

Seeing this, Yang Kai moved over to Murong Xiaoxiao's side.

"Junior Brother Yang..." Murong Xiaoxiao bit her red lips and called out, her expression complicated.

Yang Kai didn't reply. With his dragon-claw wrapped in Undying Five Elements Sword Qi, he joined forces with Murong Xiaoxiao's Feathered Heaven Ring and struck the barrier fiercely.

With their combined strength, the restriction shattered with a roar.

Yang Kai quickly took out a jade bottle, collected the drop of Taiyi Divine Water, tossed it to Murong Xiaoxiao, and said in a low voice, "Go!"
