## Chapter 2278 — Come Find Me Tonight

“Isn’t this just a book? How did it become an Imperial Treasure?” Zhang Ruoxi, inexperienced in the ways of the world and speaking without restraint, couldn’t understand and asked directly.

Duan Yuanshan smiled and said, “Secret Treasures can take countless forms; they don’t have to be swords, spears, or staves. The stranger the form, the more unique its power. I’ve heard of this Two Forms Record. It was originally a book, but after absorbing the Imperial Aura and Emperor Intent of many Emperor Realm experts, it gradually transformed into an Imperial Treasure. Lord Lou Chi obtained it, and it possesses tremendous power.”

Zhang Ruoxi listened in a daze, unable to grasp the true significance.

But the Dao Origin Realm cultivators all wore grave expressions, staring intently at the Imperial Treasure in Lou Chi’s hand, secretly excited. Each of them thought that if one day they could advance to the Emperor Realm and possess an Imperial Treasure, how wonderful that would be.

In the sky, Lou Chi’s expression was solemn. He formed seals with his hands and struck the Two Forms Record several times.

With a whoosh, the thick Two Forms Record shot out, hovering above the Spirit Lake. A mysterious aura surged forth. Lou Chi’s entire body was suffused with Emperor Intent and Imperial Might, his hand seals changing unceasingly as he chanted in a low voice, “From the One comes the Two Forms, Two Forms beget Four Symbols, Four Symbols evolve into Eight Trigrams, and the Eight Trigrams return to the Ten Directions…”

As his incantation continued, the Two Forms Record suddenly flipped open without wind, its pages rustling. With each turn, swathes of golden light shot out, radiating in all directions like drooping willow branches.

Within that golden light, there seemed to be a suppressive force capable of locking down a region, turning the world into a prison.

The speed of the seals in Lou Chi’s hands grew ever faster, and his expression became increasingly grave.

Suddenly, he withdrew his seals and shouted, “Circle Complete!”

Boom…

Golden light burst forth, so dazzling that no one could keep their eyes open.

In that instant, nearly all the cultivators gathered by the Spirit Lake were pushed back by a gentle yet irresistible force. They staggered backward but were unharmed, only managing to steady themselves after retreating over a hundred zhang.

When the golden light faded, everyone looked up and immediately gaped in astonishment.

Above the Spirit Lake, a golden, semi-circular light barrier had appeared, inverted and covering the area, sealing the surroundings completely. Not a trace of Spiritual Qi could escape.

The entire Spirit Lake spanned ten thousand zhang, yet Lou Chi alone had sealed and suppressed it. Afterward, he didn’t even look winded, as if it had been trivial.

All the Dao Origin Realm cultivators’ eyes shone with longing! Each fantasized about the day they might possess such power.

After finishing, Lou Chi turned and cupped his fists to Xiao Yuyang, saying, “I have fulfilled my duty!”

Xiao Yuyang nodded, “Thank you for your efforts.”

With that, he stepped forward, sweeping his gaze downward.

All the cultivators gathered there unconsciously straightened their backs, each feeling as if Xiao Yuyang’s gaze was fixed on them.

Who would dare be careless under the gaze of a Star Envoy from Star God Palace?

Xiao Yuyang declared in a clear voice, “The sudden appearance of the Spirit Lake in Fenglin City is a blessing for this place and for our Southern Territory. But though the Spirit Lake is rich in Spiritual Qi, if left unchecked, it will one day be depleted. So it must first be sealed. As for how to use it to benefit the people… that will require careful discussion among us.”

As he spoke, his gaze fell on Duan Yuanshan, and he said kindly, “City Lord Duan, as the lord of Fenglin City, you should join in as well!”

Duan Yuanshan was both flattered and surprised. His face flushed as he cupped his fists, “It is my honor to be invited by you, my lord!”

Xiao Yuyang nodded and said loudly, “But rest assured, everyone. Since the Spirit Lake has appeared in Fenglin City, no one can take it away, nor will we forcibly seize it. Once we have finished our discussions, it will be opened for all to use. Please await good news.”

“What? The Spirit Lake will be opened to everyone?”

“Is that true? Did I hear that right?”

“If Lord Xiao said it, it must be true!”

“Lord Xiao is truly admirable. Star God Palace is indeed the overlord sect of our Southern Territory—so generous and magnanimous!”

Many cultivators had thought they’d never have a chance to use the Spirit Lake again, but upon hearing Xiao Yuyang’s words, they erupted in excitement, their faces lighting up with joy.

Yet quite a few people wore thoughtful expressions.

Xiao Yuyang’s status was exalted; he would never lie in front of so many. If he said it would be opened, then it would be.

But… if cultivators want to enter the Spirit Lake Sacred Land in the future, it surely won’t be so simple. At the very least, there will be conditions or a price to pay. Otherwise, if just anyone could enter, even a lake of ten thousand zhang couldn’t accommodate them all.

It was easy to imagine that within a month, news of Fenglin City’s Spirit Lake would spread throughout the Southern Territory. By then, lone cultivators without sect or backing would flock here, hoping to claim a spot to cultivate.

Fenglin City would surely become the focus of the entire Southern Territory and attract countless experts.

As the city lord, Duan Yuanshan recalled how Fenglin City had always been a neglected little city, but now it was about to become the most sought-after place in the Southern Territory. His heart was filled with mixed emotions—both excitement and worry.

He was excited because with the Spirit Lake here, Fenglin City was bound to prosper. As long as they could attract enough talent, the city would quickly grow into a top-tier city.

But he was worried that his own strength was insufficient to suppress the incoming experts.

For a moment, he was filled with both hope and anxiety.

“Alright, everyone, disperse. I’m sure you’ll hear good news soon,” Xiao Yuyang said, waving his hand.

Upon hearing this, the many cultivators dared not linger. They cupped their fists and hurried toward Fenglin City.

“Yang Kai!” Gao Xueting suddenly called out.

Yang Kai turned and smiled, “Elder Gao, what can I do for you?”

“Come to my room tonight!” Gao Xueting said coolly.

“Uh…” Yang Kai was instantly dumbfounded.

The cultivators who had been about to leave all froze, turning their heads to stare at Gao Xueting in shock, their eyes wide as if they couldn’t believe their ears. They all thought that this Elder Gao of Qingyang Shrine, who always seemed cold and aloof, was unexpectedly so direct!

For a moment, everyone looked at Yang Kai with envy, jealousy, and resentment, wondering what was so special about him to earn Elder Gao’s favor.

Several Emperor Realm experts also had complicated expressions. Though they knew Gao Xueting didn’t mean it that way, the words still sounded ambiguous.

“Why are you all making those faces?” Gao Xueting glanced coldly at the Emperor Realm experts beside her, her pretty face so frosty it seemed she could scrape off a layer of ice.

“N-no reason, just a stomachache. Must’ve caught a chill last night!” Zeng Yuan clutched his stomach, looking as if he might die at any moment.

“Ate something before coming, must’ve disagreed with me!” Lou Chi replied with a pained expression.

“Are you mocking me?” Gao Xueting sneered coldly.

The two vice presidents of the Commerce Guild both forced awkward smiles, not knowing how to respond.

At that critical moment, Xiao Yuyang coughed lightly and said, “Let’s get back to business.”

“Yes, yes!” Chen Wenhao nodded repeatedly, afraid Gao Xueting would question him next.

On the other side, Yang Kai finally composed himself and cupped his fists, “As you command!”

Gao Xueting nodded, “Go on, then!”

Only then did Yang Kai feel as if he’d been granted amnesty. He pulled Zhang Ruoxi along and followed the crowd toward Fenglin City.

Along the way, countless cultivators stared at him; even Luo Yuan gave him a strange look.

“Damn it, there’s no justice! I was born so handsome and dashing, but Elder Gao doesn’t even look at me. Why is she so kind to you?” Ning Yuanshu, protected by Gao Shan and Liu Shui, shouted at Yang Kai from a distance, his face full of indignation.

Yang Kai snorted, tossed his head, his black hair flying, and blew a breath, “Isn’t it obvious? I’m just a little bit more handsome than you!”

“Do you even believe that yourself?” Ning Yuanshu sneered.

“You’re the most handsome, sir!” Zhang Ruoxi suddenly chimed in shyly from the side, her cheeks flushing as she quickly lowered her head.

Yang Kai chuckled, patted her little head, and said, “Good eye, little girl. When you grow up, you’ll definitely find a good husband!”

“I don’t want to!” Zhang Ruoxi murmured softly.

Watching this man and woman openly flirting under his nose, Ning Yuanshu’s nose nearly twisted in anger.

Suddenly, Yang Kai’s expression turned serious. He said in a deep voice, “Young Palace Master, let’s take this opportunity to speak frankly.”

“About what?” Ning Yuanshu asked in surprise.

Yang Kai glanced at him and said, “Since Gao Shan and Liu Shui are here, let them bear witness. Your eldest brother, Ning Yuancheng’s death… I saw it with my own eyes.”

At these words, Gao Shan and Liu Shui’s bodies trembled, and Ning Yuanshu’s eyes narrowed as he roared, “So it really was you!”

Yang Kai snorted, “I saw it, but I didn’t kill Ning Yuancheng.”

“Then who did?” Ning Yuanshu demanded.

“Mu Xiao!”

“Mu Xiao?” Ning Yuanshu raised his brows in confusion, clearly unfamiliar. But Gao Shan and Liu Shui’s eyes narrowed. Gao Shan exclaimed, “Two years ago, I heard that a Mu Xiao was causing trouble in Fenglin City, spreading Mu Xiao seeds, devouring souls, and enslaving people!”

"Exactly so!" Yang Kai nodded. "At some point, Ning Yuancheng was parasitized by a Mu Xiao seed, but no one noticed. The events of that day are rather complicated, but since Ning Yuancheng was a member of your Fei Sheng Palace, let me tell you what happened."

With that, Yang Kai briefly recounted the events of that day.

After listening, Gao Shan pondered for a long time before speaking, “According to you, during the auction that day, Star God Palace’s expelled disciple Han Leng tailed the Eldest Young Master and others out of the city, ambushed them to seize treasures, defeated our palace’s Elder Liu Yizhi, but was then killed by the Mu Xiao parasitizing the Eldest Young Master?”

“That’s right.” Yang Kai nodded.
