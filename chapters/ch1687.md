## Chapter 1687 — Stabilization of the Three Races

They had never expected Yang Kai to be so easygoing; he actually allowed the Liuli Sect to be rebuilt. If they had known this earlier they would have pledged allegiance long ago — who would still be nursing their petty schemes in their hearts?

Too late for regrets now. Though Yang Kai was easy to talk to, he wasn’t a fool — after they had already seen the treatment Liuli Sect received, how could he possibly accept others showing up now, wishing to join?

Many wore bitter expressions, yet forced themselves to smile and stepped forward to offer their congratulations to Gong Aofu.

Gong Aofu now counted as an elder-level figure of the Lingxiao Sect, so of course they sought to curry favor.

Gong Aofu seemed to shine because of Yang Kai's words, brimming with vitality; she responded to everyone with smiles, gracious and composed. After all, she was already a sect head — handling this scene was easy for her.

Yang Kai swept his gaze around and finally fixed it on Yan Pei.

Yan Pei's face had always been as black as the bottom of a pot; no one could read his thoughts from his expression. When he saw Yang Kai looking his way, he opened his mouth, then sighed and cupped his fists: "Sect Master Yang, take care — this old man will take his leave!"

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, “Where does Elder Yan wish to go?”

Yan Pei frowned, "I do not know either — I will go one step at a time."

Outside, the Corpse Spirit Sect's legions ravaged the land. Although Jubao Tower was no weak force, it could not stand against the Corpse Spirit Sect; otherwise they would not have dragged people to hide within the Lingxiao Sect seeking refuge. Now that they were about to leave, their prospects looked bleak, and unease sat heavy in their hearts.

“If Elder Yan doesn’t mind, why not stay? My Lingxiao Sect may not be anything extraordinary, but it’s spacious enough — there’s no need to worry about not having room for the people of Jubao Tower.”

Yan Pei trembled; a flush of excitement lit the black on his face. He looked at Yang Kai with immense gratitude, stammered a few times, and bowed his head: "This old man is ashamed!"

The last time those sects caused trouble inside the Lingxiao Sect, the people of Jubao Tower neither joined in nor stood up to stop it — they only warned Ye Xijun in advance.

To a benefactor who had taken them in and sheltered them from danger, such conduct was unquestionably ungracious.

And now, Yang Kai had put aside past grievances and personally invited them to stay — repaying resentment with virtue. Yan Pei couldn’t help but feel deeply ashamed, as though he had no face to show.

He also knew that Yang Kai had little personal connection with Jubao Tower; their few dealings had been about interests. The reason Yang Kai spoke up to retain them was largely out of respect for Qian Tong.

Yan Pei and Qian Tong had a very good private friendship.

"You flatter me, Elder Yan Pei. Once this calamity has passed, my Lingxiao Sect may need the help of Jubao Tower — I hope you will not refuse then!" Sect Master Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

"Sect Master, you are too courteous. In the future, if the Lingxiao Sect requires anything from Jubao Tower, simply notify us," Yan Pei replied solemnly.

Yang Kai smiled in satisfaction, secretly thinking that old black-faced Yan Pei was indeed quite sensible.

He had invited Yan Pei partly because of Qian Tong, but the main reason was that Jubao Tower could not be underestimated. Their combat power might be unimpressive before him, but Jubao Tower's business across the Dark Star ran deep; they had channels Lingxiao Sect did not. For Lingxiao Sect's growth, having such an ally was far from a bad thing.

Moreover, the true culprits who had forced Ye Xijun to withdraw had already been executed. Yang Kai's hatred had been vented; he did not intend to pursue the rest.

If he were to slaughter everyone present, it would be a great loss for the Dark Star. Rather than die by his hand, it was better to let them go fight the Corpse Spirit Sect and exert their remaining strength.

For a time the square was blissful, though ninety-nine percent of the experts around Yang Kai remained cautious, lest they provoke his displeasure.

Only those who had effectively joined the Lingxiao Sect, like Gong Aofu and the others, looked more natural and at ease.

Yang Kai had been away from the Lingxiao Sect for a long time; he cared deeply about sect affairs and was concerned for Ye Xijun's injuries. He had no intention of continuing the small talk. After waving them off to their residences, he summoned the people on his warship and had them disembark.

Those people did not need Yang Kai's attention — Yang Xiuzhu and the others had already arranged everything.

Yang Kai hurried toward the Sixth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

To his surprise, he had not even flown out of the Lingxiao Sect when a great radiance came to meet him from afar. The aura at its head was familiar — who else but Ye Xijun?

Yang Kai was stunned, then quickly understood: although his actions in the square had been brief, they had caused some disturbances; Ye Xijun had likely sensed this and brought Lingxiao Sect's forces from the depths of the Sixth Layer.

Since they had returned, Yang Kai stood where he was and waited.

A moment later, a party of more than two hundred people, led by Ye Xijun, descended not far before him.

Before Yang Kai could assess Ye Xijun's condition, the Great Elder stepped forward and asked, "Is everything taken care of?"

Yang Kai was taken aback for a moment, then chuckled. “Great Elder, you trust me that much?”

Ye Xijun said calmly, "You are the Sect Master — if I cannot trust you, whom else would I trust?"

Yang Kai sighed and nodded: "It's been handled."

Ye Xijun glanced toward the direction of the square and said softly, "The stench of blood is strong — many died, didn't they?"

Yang Kai sneered, "Myriad Beasts Mountain, Medicine Pill Sect, and Piaomiao Hall — all were annihilated!"

Ye Xijun showed little reaction, but those who followed her all displayed looks of exhilaration, as if great vengeance had been achieved.

It was precisely those three sects who had instigated matters and turned many of the experts against the Lingxiao Sect, forcing Ye Xijun to withdraw.

"Sect Master!" Chang Qi suddenly stepped forward from the rear and bowed to Yang Kai. "Let it be known to the Sect Master that the Great Elder led our retreat from the headquarters not because she could not contend with those scoundrels, but because the Great Elder feared the fighting would harm our disciples. Our Lingxiao Sect's bloodlines remain thin; we can ill afford the losses."

"I know," Yang Kai replied with a slight smile.

Chang Qi was surprised, then quickly recovered and respectfully returned to Ye Xijun's side.

Yang Kai had originally thought Ye Xijun retreated deep into the Flowing Flame Sandland because she was outnumbered; after seeing the state of these people, he immediately deduced the real reason.

This group before him was indeed much smaller than when he had left the Lingxiao Sect, and nearly half bore injuries, yet Ye Xijun herself appeared largely unscathed. With her abilities, if she had truly unleashed herself, how could Myriad Beasts Mountain, Medicine Pill Sect, and Piaomiao Hall have driven her away?

Her hasty withdrawal had been entirely to look after the sect's other people.

She might be able to fight ten to one, but the others could not, especially the disciples of the Haike Family who still only cultivated to about the Saint King Realm.

If Ye Xijun had not retreated, those people would have been utterly slaughtered.

In other words, if Ye Xijun had chosen to fight to the bitter end in that battle, while Lingxiao Sect might have survived, at least half of those people in the square would have died.

"Since the Sect Master knows, then I have nothing more to say," Ye Xijun said with a faint nod, her expression as cold as ever.

"How is the Great Elder's injury? On my way back I heard you clashed with two of the Corpse Spirit Sect's experts and suffered heavy wounds."

“Mm, they were indeed formidable. Facing the two of them at once, I wasn’t quite their match. But it’s nothing serious now — with a month or so of recuperation, I should fully recover.”

"That is good. Many people will be moving into the sect soon and the Great Elder will be needed to oversee arrangements."

Ye Xijun glanced at Yang Kai and snorted, "You are rather pleased to be idle."

Yang Kai laughed heartily, "This is not my forte — I have been away for seven or eight years and am not well versed in sect affairs."

"Very well, I will handle it then," Ye Xijun said, taking charge.

The party of more than two hundred people swiftly returned to the main headquarters.

When Yang Kai released nearly ten thousand people of the human, yao, and demonic races from the Xuan Realm Pearl, even the composed Ye Xijun could not help but feel moved.

Although Yang Kai had forewarned her that a large force would be moving into the Lingxiao Sect, she had not expected it to be so massive.

Furthermore, all of those people had been brought back from Yang Kai's homeland — their loyalty was not in question.

In terms of sheer numbers, the Lingxiao Sect had already surpassed any single power on the Dark Star! Of course it still could not be compared with the Corpse Spirit Sect. More and more were swearing allegiance to the Corpse Spirit Sect; nearly half of Dark Star had fallen into the grasp of their legions.

Nearly ten thousand people, covering the three races — how to settle them was undeniably a problem.

But Yang Kai had no need to worry about it himself.

After Ye Xijun summoned the top experts of the three races and inquired into their needs, she quickly assigned their people to different mountain peaks.

Each of those peaks already had existing cave mansions and building complexes. The humans, demons, and yao only needed to tidy them up a bit before moving in.

As for Lingxiao Sect's original members, they continued to live in their own residences without change.

In a single day Ye Xijun briskly arranged everything.

Lingxiao Sect had suddenly absorbed nearly ten thousand new members — it was easy to imagine that, in time, it would undoubtedly become the undisputed number one Sect on Dark Star.

After this influx, the utilization rate of those eighty-one mountain peaks was still less than one fifth — the remaining peaks remained unclaimed.

The other sect experts who had come seeking refuge looked on with envy but could do nothing about it.

Besides, most of them had offended the Lingxiao Sect before; although Yang Kai was no longer pursuing past grievances, they still lived cautiously, fearful of angering Yang Kai and being cast out.

In the following days Yang Kai went alone, inspecting the various peaks to check how well the human, yao, and demon people were integrating.

The outcome was naturally favorable — none of the three races were dissatisfied. Compared to the Tongxuan Continent, the Dark Star was a veritable paradise for cultivation, and the Lingxiao Sect occupied the most fertile lands on the Dark Star.
