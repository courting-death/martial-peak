## Chapter 847 — Elder Du's Guest

Inside the Alchemists' Association, when Mi Na saw Yang Kai—whom she hadn't seen in years—she brightened up with obvious delight.

Yet when she thought of Elder Du's care for him, a flash of resentment still prickled her teeth; because of that old man, she couldn't say how many times she'd run to the Tianxiao Sect, nearly trampling the peaks there flat.

"So here I am in person, aren’t I?” Yang Kai chuckled.

"Good of you to show some sense!" Mi Na snorted, eyeing him up and down with suspicion. "That person who just asked Wu'er to refine pills… it wouldn't happen to be you, would it?"

"It was," Yang Kai nodded.

Mi Na patted her soft chest and exhaled: "It really was you—then it's fine. I thought some blind idiot had taken a notion to go after Wu'er; I was just about to come and give them a lesson."

Yang Kai smiled. "She seemed like she needed some materials to practice with, so I indulged her… When did the Alchemists' Association get this little girl? I never noticed her before."

At that, Mi Na's expression dimmed. She glanced back to make sure Wu'er had already gone off, then lowered her voice: "Elder Du and I picked her up… poor thing."

"Picked her up?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

"Mm. When we were returning from Fuyun City back then, we passed a village that had been attacked by a pack of beasts; everyone was dead. She was the only one left, wailing amid the ruined walls. Elder Du couldn't bear to leave her there and brought her back to Giant Stone City. When he took her in, she wasn't even ten, scrawny and unable to speak—seemed half-crazed with fright… After years of care she became like this. She's full of energy now—runs around all day; I can't keep up with her."

Yang Kai couldn't help laughing and nodded: "You two certainly found a promising seedling."

"Indeed!" Mi Na's eyes gleamed. "Elder Du said he never expected Wu'er to be so suited to alchemy. When he brought her back she hadn't even begun cultivation; now look at her realm—True Yuan Realm, Ninth Stage. As for her pillcraft, she's nearly reached Mystery-Grade. As her senior sister, I feel the pressure—if I don't work harder, this little girl will surpass me."

Yang Kai burst out laughing. "That'll still take some years."

"Probably not that long…" Mi Na's face went bitter. "I'm only a lower-level Spirit-Grade alchemist—only one major step above Wu'er. With how fast that girl is growing, she could overtake me in less than ten years."

As she spoke, Mi Na suddenly glanced at Yang Kai with curiosity. "What about you? Any progress at the upper level of Spirit-Grade?"

"A little, I suppose." Yang Kai rubbed his nose, not daring to tell the full truth for fear of discouraging Mi Na.

"Alright, alright—looking at you I can tell you've already refined saint pills. I'm just a plain mortal. No point comparing me to you two freaks!" Mi Na feigned dejection, then laughed: "Let's not talk here—come in. If Elder Du knows you've come, he'll be delighted."

Yang Kai inclined his head and followed her into the Alchemists' Association.

Before they reached the inner rooms, Yang Kai's expression changed and he asked suspiciously, "Is Elder Du receiving guests?"

He sensed several presences inside Elder Du's rooms—faint laughter and the murmur of conversation. Among them was Du Wan. The others were no weaklings either; each bore a Transcendent Realm presence.

"Yes," Mi Na replied. "There happen to be guests today."

"Then I'll wait outside."

"No need…" Mi Na smiled mysteriously. "I think those guests would very much like to meet you."

Yang Kai froze, then realization dawned: "Could they be the ones we met back in Fuyun City?"

"Smart!" Mi Na purse-lipped and laughed, and by the time she spoke they had reached Du Wan's door. She called out loudly: "Elder Du, another guest has arrived."

The laughter and conversation inside paused, then Du Wan's voice called: "Tell him to come another day; I won't see other guests today."

"Are you sure, Elder Du? If that's the case, I'll chase him off." Mi Na teased as she winked at Yang Kai.

"You little thing…" Du Wan's resigned chuckle came from inside. "Who is it? From the tone of your words it sounds like quite an important guest."

Before Mi Na could answer, Yang Kai stepped forward respectfully: "Elder Du, it's me—youngster Yang Kai!"

"Yang Kai?" Du Wan's voice shot up. Then the sound of hurried steps followed; moments later the door opened and Du Wan peered out, his face lighting with surprise. When he saw Yang Kai, his clouded eyes suddenly sparkled: "It really is you!"

Yang Kai smiled and inclined his head.

"Come in, come in!" Du Wan greeted him warmly and ushered Yang Kai inside. "You've finally returned."

"I've wandered about for a while, and only recently returned to the sect. I heard Elder Du sent Mi Na repeatedly to the Tianxiao Sect to inquire about me; I appreciate Elder Du's concern greatly." Yang Kai spoke solemnly.

"Don't be so formal—you're a member of our Alchemists' Association; as the steward, it's my duty to take an interest." Du Wan chuckled, his old face lighting up like a flower. "You come just in time—we were speaking of you not long ago with a few old friends."

With that, they entered the side room.

Inside, several old men of similar temperament and age to Du Wan craned their necks toward the door, their faces alight with eager expectation.

When Yang Kai appeared, their expressions shifted from surprise to suspicion.

"Eh, Du Wan." A rotund, loutish old man on the left called out, "Something off here—I'm sure the boy I met before wasn't him. Du Wan, are you losing your mind and trying to fool me?"

The fat fellow, apparently too obese to sit upright, slumped against the wall like a lump of meat, and was out of breath after speaking.

"Yeah… similar build and the same voice, but the looks aren't right!" Another elder on the right stroked his beard as he scrutinized Yang Kai.

"Heh heh, you two fools—don't you remember when Du Wan refined pills for someone and obtained a miraculous secret treasure?" The man in the middle seemed to have seen through it at once and laughed triumphantly. "I recall that treasure could change a person's appearance and aura."

"So that means… this really is the boy? The person we saw back then wasn't his true appearance?" The fourth, an old woman with bright eyes, exclaimed.

"It is indeed me—greetings, masters." Yang Kai smiled and cupped his fist.

"Come, sit and talk." Du Wan gestured warmly. "We're all lazy here; don't be so stiff—make yourself at home."

Yang Kai glanced around and saw these masters were indeed informal—there were chairs and tables nearby, yet they sat on the floor, probably because of the overly rotund man's presence.

He didn't fuss and sat down beside Du Wan.

Four pairs of eyes watched him with keen interest, and Yang Kai let out an awkward chuckle.

He remembered that in Fuyun City, after winning the alchemy contest, he'd taken some items from these four men's spatial pouches.

"Du Wan, you're crafty—so you secretly gave the boy that disguise treasure. No wonder people kept searching for him with his portrait and never found him." The old woman smiled.

"If not for that, he'd have been beset with trouble long ago." Du Wan smiled faintly. "Although some leads pointed to the Tianxiao Sect, with Chu Lingxiao holding court there no one dared stir up trouble."

Since Yang Kai had distilled the medicine extract of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, it was natural that some would probe for his whereabouts, hoping to obtain such a heaven-and-earth treasure from him.

"You didn't know from the start that he could obtain the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's extract, did you?"

"I only thought it best not to let him reveal his identity before so many people." Du Wan chuckled. "I didn't scheme that far, but his being able to obtain the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's extract was certainly astonishing."

Then he added, "Ah, Yang Kai, let me introduce you—this is Hong Fang, the steward of the Alchemists' Association in Fragmented Star City, a lower-level Saint-Grade alchemist!"

"Greetings, Master Hong!" Yang Kai saluted respectfully.

"You're too kind!" Hong Fang stroked his beard and smiled. "Before long, you might reach my level—no need to call me 'master'."

Du Wan smiled and didn't argue; he then pointed to the rotund man: "This is Chang Bao, steward of the Alchemists' Association in Shining City, a lower-level Saint-Grade alchemist! Chang brother loves food and drink, which is why he's ended up this size—let that be a warning to you."

Chang Bao snorted: "Eating is one of life's pleasures, Du Wan—you don't know how to enjoy it."

Du Wan ignored him and indicated another: "This is He Feng, steward of the Alchemists' Association in San Chuan City, a lower-level Saint-Grade alchemist!"

No sooner had he introduced him than He Feng leaned in with a grin: "Boy, years ago I invited you to San Chuan City and you refused—care to reconsider today?"

He winked and added, "I have several pretty granddaughters you can choose from—take them all if you like, just promise to come to my San Chuan City Alchemists' Association."

"I'm grateful for your favor, master, but Elder Du has been my benefactor; please forgive me—I must decline your kind offer."

He Feng rolled his eyes and snorted: "You've got guts—nobody has ever had the nerve to refuse me face to face. You insolent brat, you've made me lose face time and time again!"

"Who asked you to make a fool of yourself?" Du Wan laughed heartily. Yang Kai's frank, plain words seemed to please him; paying no mind to He Feng, Du Wan turned to the old woman and announced, "This is Kong Ruoyu, steward of the Alchemists' Association in Broken Moon City, a lower-level Saint-Grade alchemist!"

Yang Kai's expression turned solemn and he saluted again.

Most top alchemists and artificers are men; few women achieve such heights, for women tend to be yin in constitution, which doesn't suit the yang fire needed for pillcraft and artifact-making. That Kong Ruoyu reached the lower echelon of Saint-Grade alchemy shows she worked harder and had better talent than most—had she been male, her achievements might well be higher.
