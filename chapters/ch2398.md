## Chapter 2398 — Everything Is Ready

Chi Ri seemed completely unconcerned by Bing Yun’s cold demeanor. On the contrary, he greatly admired it, finding her all the more interesting because of it. He smiled and said, “Then this Lord won’t disturb your cultivation, little sister. I’ll return in a month, and I promise you won’t be disappointed!”

With that, he let out a hearty laugh and vanished in an instant.

Bing Yun sat there with a frosty expression, her beautiful face extremely dark.

After a long while, she finally reached out and knocked on the hidden compartment below, saying, “You can come out now.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai hurriedly leapt out. Looking around, he saw that the furnishings in the pavilion were not the least bit disordered. It seemed that the earlier clash between two Great Emperor Third Stage experts hadn’t affected this place at all. Yang Kai couldn’t help but click his tongue in amazement, for he had clearly sensed the violent collision of powerful forces in this area just now, yet not a single trace remained. It was clear that both Bing Yun and Chi Ri had achieved the pinnacle of control over their own strength.

On the table nearby, there was still a cup of tea, though much of it had spilled onto the table.

“Senior, that Chi Ri…” Yang Kai opened his mouth, hesitating to continue.

Bing Yun sighed and said, “You’ve probably noticed—he has some… intentions toward me.”

“That old bastard is like a toad lusting after a swan,” Yang Kai said angrily.

Bing Yun glanced at him, understanding that Yang Kai was speaking up on her behalf. She smiled faintly and said, “He’s not quite a toad, you know. Chi Ri does have some skill—right now, I’m no match for him.”

Yang Kai was startled. “If it really came to a life-and-death battle, how much chance would Senior have to win?”

Bing Yun frowned in thought. “Less than thirty percent.” She sighed again, then continued, “He’s the master of Tongtian Island, controlling all its cultivation resources. Though his strength has declined over the years, mine has fallen even further. If we were both at our peak, I’d have nothing to fear from him. But now… as one rises, the other falls.”

Yang Kai looked suddenly enlightened.

Although the Spiritual Qi in this Jixu Secret Realm was extremely dense, it wasn’t suitable for cultivation. No matter how strong one was, staying here too long would cause their strength to decline. The cultivation resources Chi Ri controlled were far beyond what Bing Yun could access, so his decline was much slower, leaving Bing Yun at a disadvantage.

“But it’s not possible for him to take me by force, so a hundred years ago, I made an agreement with him.”

“What kind of agreement?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Bing Yun pointed to the cup of tea on the table. “If he can snatch this cup of tea from me and drink it all in front of me without spilling a single drop, I’ll let him do as he pleases. If he can’t, he must leave!”

Yang Kai looked at the teacup and the spilled tea on the table, finally understanding why Bing Yun had said, ‘you spilled the water’ earlier.

So the two experts had been fighting over this cup of spiritual tea, but in the end, Chi Ri failed at the last moment.

Bing Yun frowned slightly. “At first, he would only bother me once every few years, but lately he’s grown impatient. The last time he came was three months ago, and this time he was even harder to deal with. He’ll be back in a month, and I may not be able to stop him.”

At this, she couldn’t help but look worried.

Back then, making this agreement with Chi Ri was a last resort. Both were Third Stage of the Emperor Realm; they couldn’t really fight it out. If they did, the entire Tongtian Island would be leveled.

There were still a few of her disciples in Ice Heart Pavilion. She wasn’t afraid of offending Chi Ri herself, but what about her disciples?

The agreement had delayed things for a hundred years, but it was never a permanent solution.

“Chi Ri is also extremely petty. If he saw you and me alone together, it wouldn’t be good for you.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally understood why Bing Yun had hidden him in the secret compartment. So the master of Tongtian Island was a jealous man. A young man alone with Bing Yun—of course he’d get the wrong idea.

But he hasn’t even succeeded yet, and already treats Bing Yun as his possession. This master of Tongtian Island is truly shameless, caring only for his own pleasure and ignoring everyone else’s feelings.

“So what does Senior plan to do?” Yang Kai asked nervously, hearing that she might not be able to stop him in a month.

“That’s why I need someone to refine Emperor Yuan Pills for me!” Bing Yun said solemnly. “As long as I have enough Emperor Yuan Pills, I can leave Tongtian Island, even escape Jixu Secret Realm, and never have to worry about Chi Ri again.”

“Leave Jixu Secret Realm!” Yang Kai was invigorated by her words, but then realized something and exclaimed, “Senior, do you plan to fly all the way to the exit?”

Sangde once said that the exit was extremely far from Tongtian Island. Even Third Stage Emperor Realm experts might not be able to reach it, mainly because they’d run out of strength along the way.

Flying over the sea consumed too much energy, and without replenishment, one would be exhausted.

And on the sea, you couldn’t stop often, nor could you use Source Crystals to restore your strength. The only solution was Spiritual Pills.

Emperor Yuan Pills were the best choice!

Yang Kai only had to think for a moment to understand why Bing Yun wanted Emperor Yuan Pills—they were for restoring strength at a critical moment.

“You know where the exit is?” Now it was Bing Yun’s turn to be surprised.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I don’t. I’ve only heard about it.”

“Where did you hear that? As far as I know, only three people know the location. I’m one, Chi Ri is another, and the third disappeared long ago.”

Yang Kai grinned. “The third person Senior mentioned should be Sangde’s master. A few days ago…”

Yang Kai then recounted his experiences at sea with Sangde and the others.

After listening, Bing Yun’s beautiful eyes suddenly lit up. She stared at Yang Kai and asked, “You mean, the Bihai Shuttle is in your hands now?”

“Exactly. It’s not convenient to take it out here, but the Bihai Shuttle is indeed with me.”

“Is this fate?” Bing Yun murmured. If it weren’t fate, how could she and Yang Kai, both from the Hengluo Star Domain, meet here? If it weren’t fate, how could Yang Kai have obtained the Bihai Shuttle, and at such a critical moment?

She had only been happy to meet someone from her homeland in this place, and Yang Kai had left a good impression on her. If he weren’t a man, Bing Yun might have even considered bringing him into Ice Heart Valley.

But now, Yang Kai had given her an even greater surprise! Even someone as calm as Bing Yun couldn’t help but get a little excited.

With the Bihai Shuttle, there was no need to refine Emperor Yuan Pills. She could simply use the Bihai Shuttle to reach the exit, which was much safer than flying there herself.

She had been worried about how to take her disciples with her, but now that was no longer a problem.

“Sangde’s master disappeared over a thousand years ago. Both Chi Ri and I searched for him many times, but found no clues. We thought he’d perished, but it turns out he was hiding outside, secretly refining the Bihai Shuttle. In the end, though, it benefited someone else.” Bing Yun sighed.

She also understood why Sangde’s master had hidden himself—he was afraid Chi Ri would capture him and force him to refine the Bihai Shuttle. Willingly doing it and being forced were two very different things.

The reason she had gathered so many materials in Ice Heart Pavilion was because she wanted to train a high-level alchemist to refine Emperor Yuan Pills for her.

Over the years, she had spent countless resources collecting medicinal ingredients, but none of the alchemists she hired met her requirements. In the end, Yang Kai arrived, and Bing Yun had planned to take a gamble on him, letting him refine Spiritual Pills regardless of success or failure. Now, it seemed there was no need.

Yang Kai scratched his head. “I actually came to Ice Heart Pavilion to ask Senior about the exit, but since your strength is so great, I didn’t dare bring it up before.”

Bing Yun smiled slightly. “It’s only natural to be cautious. Don’t worry about it.”

As a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, Yang Kai was right to be careful when seeking cooperation with her.

“I have the Bihai Shuttle, and Senior knows the location of the exit. Everything is ready—we can set out at any time.” Yang Kai was elated. He hadn’t expected things to go so smoothly. He’d planned to take it slow, but after learning Bing Yun’s true identity, he had no more concerns.

“That may be so, but leaving won’t be easy!” Bing Yun frowned.

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“If I leave Tongtian Island, Chi Ri will definitely notice. If we really fall out…” Bing Yun looked worried. If it came to a real fight with Chi Ri, she wasn’t sure she could escape unscathed.

Yang Kai thought for a moment. “Senior, you said you’re not Chi Ri’s match now because your strength has declined more than his?”

“That’s right. If we were both at our peak, we’d be evenly matched.”

Yang Kai’s lips curled up. “What if I had a way to help Senior recover to your peak in a short time?”

Bing Yun’s eyes lit up. “What way? For me to recover, I’d need an enormous amount of resources. With your abilities…”

“Take a look at this, Senior.” As he spoke, Yang Kai took out a Spatial Ring and tossed it to Bing Yun.

Bing Yun accepted it suspiciously. Sweeping her Divine Sense inside, her expression changed instantly and she exclaimed, “Where did you get so many Source Crystals?”

There was nothing else in the Spatial Ring—just Source Crystals. And there were a full ten million Upper-Level Source Crystals!

Such a huge number of Source Crystals would shock anyone on Tongtian Island, even if Bing Yun herself had seen plenty before.

Even Chi Ri couldn’t produce so many Source Crystals at once.

Yang Kai grinned. “To tell the truth, I’ve only been in Jixu Secret Realm for a few months. I brought all these from outside.”

“You’ve only been here a few months!” Bing Yun was stunned. In just a few months, he’d managed to get the Bihai Shuttle—something she and Chi Ri had sought for a thousand years. The comparison was enough to drive her mad.
