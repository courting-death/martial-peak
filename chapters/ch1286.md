## Chapter 1286 — Bloom, Lotus

After Yin Sudie asked those two questions, she made no move to resist; her delicate body seemed so frail a breeze might topple her.

But the moment Yang Kai saw her face, his expression changed drastically. He waved his hand and retracted the mountain phantoms that had been hurled at them, and the Hundred Mountains Painting reappeared in his hand.

He looked in the direction where Yin Sudie stood with disbelief, his eyes full of tenderness, his lips trembling as he exclaimed, "Su Yan?"

The woman standing before Hou was no longer Yin Sudie; she was clearly the beauty Yang Kai kept hidden deep in his heart, the one who haunted his dreams at midnight.

His expression froze. He stared dumbly at that face he thought of day and night; the tenderness in his eyes seemed able to melt stone.

Opposite him, Su Yan returned his gaze with the same infinite tenderness. Yet imperceptibly her lips twitched slightly, as if that unfamiliar name had reached her and made her feel strange.

Just as she thought Yang Kai had been beguiled, his expression suddenly turned icy cold; the tenderness in his eyes vanished in an instant, replaced by thick loathing and chill.

Seeing Yang Kai's change, Yin Sudie realized something was wrong. She cried out softly, grabbed Hou—who had overexerted himself and lost much blood, his face pale and swaying—and tried to flee.

But Yang Kai's low voice suddenly rang out: "Bloom, Lotus!"

The woman who had been staring at Yang Kai stiffened. Faintly, she saw within his eyes the phantom of a lotus bud about to bloom; it was extraordinarily beautiful, radiating seven-colored light. It seized all her attention and made her involuntarily want to study it more closely.

At that moment the lotus phantom vanished from Yang Kai's eyes and, strangely, appeared in her Sea of Consciousness.

Divine Sense attack! Yin Sudie's face changed. She immediately understood what was at work and prepared to defend, but found the Divine Sense power in her Sea of Consciousness frantically converging toward one spot as if a huge whirlpool had formed, drawing her Divine Sense in and swallowing it. The source of the pull was the bud of the lotus.

Yin Sudie let out a muffled groan and fell limp from midair. Looking inward, she saw the bud glowing with seven-colored light slowly opening. With each fraction it opened, countless pieces of her Divine Sense were consumed; it seemed the bloom fed on her Divine Sense as its root.

Panic seized her and she hurriedly activated several spirit-defense secret techniques, but no matter how hard she struggled she could not stop the rate at which her Divine Sense was being devoured.

In the blink of an eye her Sea of Consciousness had been drained by more than half, and the bud had only just begun to open.

If such a small opening consumed so much, a full bloom would surely suck her Sea of Consciousness dry. Even if she did not die, her spirit would be grievously wounded—wounds not healed in a day or two.

At that thought, Yin Sudie's face turned deathly pale. She had not expected Yang Kai to dare use such a killing method on her; in an instant her eyes flashed with a boundless will to live, making her look pitiably helpless.

Thud...

Yin Sudie fell to the ground, dust covering her body. There was no trace of her previous coquettishness. Her face was pale, her head pounding, she groaned constantly, and beads of sweat poured from her until her clothes were soaked.

She could not even open her mouth to beg!

The pain of having her spirit drained was far worse than any pain she had endured before. She could only grit her teeth and cling to the last thread of clarity in her Sea of Consciousness.

Even so, she knew that once the seven-colored lotus fully bloomed, she would truly be finished.

Rustle...

A soft set of footsteps drew near from afar. Yin Sudie weakly turned her head toward the sound and saw Yang Kai approach, his face as dark as water. He stood before her, looking down coldly, his eyes utterly devoid of feeling.

Yin Sudie opened her mouth to say something but could not utter a word.

Crack—Yang Kai snapped his fingers.

The seven-colored lotus slowly blooming in Yin Sudie's mind abruptly halted, then dissolved into motes of light and vanished.

Seeing this, Yin Sudie's face brightened. She hurriedly examined her Sea of Consciousness and was both astonished and horrified: her Sea had almost dried up. If Yang Kai had not stopped that strange secret art at the last moment, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Even now, to fully recover she would have to pay a huge price and spend a long time.

From the moment Yang Kai suddenly unleashed the Blooming Lotus Secret Art until now, no more than three breaths had passed.

Within those three breaths, the strongman who had been guarding Yin Sudie did not know exactly what had occurred, but he understood that the three of them had truly run into serious trouble.

Seeing Yang Kai's attention elsewhere, he glanced at the bedraggled Yin Sudie, steeled himself, gritted his teeth, and began circulating Saint Yuan to leave.

He had no time to care for Yin Sudie.

But he had only just moved when a shadow flickered before him and the cold-faced Yang Kai blocked his path.

Hou's lips were dry as he stared at the figure before him, his eyes full of terror; he did not dare move.

Yang Kai flicked his finger and a streak of pitch-black Demonic Flame shot out, gouging a hole in the man's left chest. The man did not even have time to form a thought of resistance; he let out a muffled groan, clutched his chest and staggered several steps, then his expression went from disbelief to dim, and he fell headlong through the air, his body wrapped in Demonic Flame and incinerated to ashes.

Having done that, Yang Kai's figure flickered and he returned to Yin Sudie's side.

Yin Sudie still had her hands pressed to her head, panting weakly. It appeared the Blooming Lotus Secret Art had inflicted great harm, leaving her without strength to flee.

Beside her lay a pristine white bead that had fallen to the ground.

Yang Kai glanced at the bead, then reached out and drew it into his hand. Although he did not know what mystery it contained, it was with this very bead that Yin Sudie had peered into the depths of his mind moments ago, glimpsed that beautiful figure within, and then used her charm technique to make him hallucinate that Su Yan was standing right before him.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai made a soft whooshing sound with his hand. As the Demonic Flame rolled, the bead quickly melted and vanished from the world.

Whatever the bead was or however valuable, Yang Kai did not want to keep it.

After burning the bead, Yang Kai coldly stared at Yin Sudie and said indifferently, "Did you think I wouldn't dare kill?"

Yin Sudie's eyes were full of terror and she dared not answer.

She had watched Yang Kai kill the warrior surnamed Hou clearly. She knew her action must have struck his bottom line; otherwise he would not have waited until now to kill—he could have acted the first time the warrior surnamed Hou sought him out.

That woman called Su Yan must be extremely important to him; otherwise why would this happen?

Her thoughts turning swiftly, Yin Sudie was full of regret. Had she known Yang Kai was so formidable, she would never have come to stir trouble.

"Did you think I wouldn't dare kill you?" Yang Kai asked again.

"You can't kill me..." Yin Sudie forced herself to speak in a whisper, panting. "My Senior Brother should have already succeeded; you should consider your companion."

"Succeeded?" Yang Kai's mouth curled. He suddenly swung his hand and sent out a filament of golden light—so thin it seemed like a single golden thread—and in a flash it vanished into the void.

A moment later a terrified shout came from the other side. Where there had been nothing a layer of glow rose, shattered, and a figure appeared—the warrior surnamed Luo.

After Yin Sudie inexplicably fell from the air and Hou was killed, he seemed to realize the situation was bad and used the Fleeting Light Evasion Technique to try to escape. But pursued by the golden thread he was forced out; the golden thread seemed alive—no matter how he resisted, it invaded and entangled him, and in moments he was bound.

That golden thread was naturally Yang Kai's Golden Blood Threads technique, a sort of Secret Treasure.

The Golden Blood Threads technique derived from the Demon Blood Sect's Demon Blood Threads technique. Yang Kai had been experimenting with its power for some time, which was why he deployed it now. Seeing the warrior surnamed Luo so easily bound and unable to break free pleased him greatly.

He waved his hand again; with the Golden Blood Threads pulling, Luo was dragged back to a spot not far from Yang Kai.

At this, Yin Sudie's nose flared with anger.

Earlier she and Yang Kai had been locked in a fierce struggle, and she had full confidence in her Senior Brother, so she had not been paying attention to his situation with Yang Yan—she had instinctively assumed Yang Yan had already been captured.

Now seeing the truth, she realized how naive that assumption had been.

When Luo was brought over, the black-robed Yang Yan also strolled up. Aside from being a bit startled she appeared completely unscathed—her robe not even ruffled. No one knew how she had held Luo off for so long.

"Succeeded? Are you sleeping?" Yang Kai sneered.

Yin Sudie's face flushed with shame and anger; she wished she could hide in a hole. She glared coldly at Luo, silently cursing him for being useless.

Luo tasted bitter resentment. He had never expected Yang Yan to possess so many Secret Treasures, each formidable. In his attempt to capture Yang Yan she had never counterattacked, only defended, but those defenses could not be breached no matter how he struck. Now that Yang Kai had brought him forward, he dared not meet Yin Sudie's eyes.

Seeing Yin Sudie refuse to speak, Yang Kai snorted. He spread his hand and a huge palm imprint slammed down on Luo. Under his terrifying gaze the man was knocked to the ground; many bones cracked in the sound, and that single blow left Luo grievously wounded.

But to his secret relief, Yang Kai did not seem intent on killing him.
