## Chapter 2614 — Fu Bo

"Lady Feng, didn't you say you couldn't act too recklessly in a human Sect? Yet here you are, having just killed the Great Elder's grandson. Isn't that a bit much?" Yang Kai glanced at Luan Feng, whose face was icy cold.

Luan Feng gritted her teeth and snapped, "He dared lay his hands on me—did you expect me to just let him grope me?"

After a pause, she added angrily, "Sir Yang isn't a good person either!"

"What are you saying..." Yang Kai was speechless. "What does this have to do with me? He was the one who tried to take liberties with you, not me."

Luan Feng glared at him. "Why did you step aside then!"

Yang Kai had been fully capable of stopping what happened, but he had deliberately moved aside, which infuriated Luan Feng. If not for Yang Kai stepping away, she wouldn't have lost her temper and killed the man on the spot.

"Heh heh..." Yang Kai gave a dry laugh and said, "It was just a reflex, just a reflex. He was trash anyway, so killing him is no big deal. Lady Feng, you don't need to mind it."

Luan Feng's face remained cold, still somewhat resentful. She suspected Yang Kai had done it on purpose to drag her into trouble. Now, in a fit of anger, she had killed the Great Elder's grandson, and thus formed a grudge with the Netherworld Sect.

"You... do you even realize who he was?" Over on the side, the woman who had long since grown used to vomiting finally regained her senses, accepting the brutal reality of the Great Elder's grandson dying right before her eyes. Still, she couldn't help but stare at Yang Kai and the others in utter shock.

These people were far too bold. They had killed the Great Elder's grandson and were acting as if nothing had happened, not fleeing but standing here chatting.

"I heard him introduce himself just now. The Great Elder's grandson, right?" Yang Kai looked at the woman with a grin.

"You..." The woman was completely dumbfounded now. Her once flirtatious peach blossom eyes were now filled with terror, and she had no idea what to say. But one thing she knew for sure: the Great Elder would never let them go. The Great Elder's line was thin, and by the third generation, only this grandson remained. Unfortunately, he was unambitious and untalented, spending his days chasing after women.

Many Senior Sisters in the Sect had suffered at his hands—some willingly, others forced.

Because he was the Great Elder's grandson, he had abundant cultivation resources, so many Senior Sisters set their sights on him, taking the initiative to undress in hopes of gaining some useful resources. She herself was one of them. As for those who were forced, they had no way to seek revenge, since the Great Elder protected him.

Still, the man was clever. Those he forced were always low-status Senior Sisters in the Sect, who had no one to complain to. As for those with status, he always tempted them with benefits, never using force.

That was how she had entangled herself in this mess.

Who would have thought that after sacrificing her body, she would not only gain nothing, but also witness his death with her own eyes.

These two women and one man were doomed, and she feared she would be implicated as well...

Thinking of the Great Elder's fury, the woman couldn't help but shiver, her face growing even paler.

"Don't be afraid," Yang Kai said gently. "We won't do anything to you."

"What do you want?" the woman asked, her voice tinged with sobs.

"Where is your Sect Master Fu Bo right now?" Yang Kai asked with a smile. But that harmless smile only made the woman feel he was more terrifying than a demon.

Instinctively, she pointed in a direction. "That mountain peak is where the Sect Master cultivates."

"Oh?" Yang Kai looked in the direction she pointed and nodded slightly. "Thanks!"

As he spoke, he took Ji Yao and Luan Feng and flew toward that mountain peak.

The remaining Netherworld Sect woman stood there in a daze. After a while, she suddenly shivered and hurriedly flew toward another mountain peak.

She needed to report what had just happened to the Great Elder as soon as possible. Otherwise, if the Great Elder investigated, she would surely die.

At the mountain peak's summit, the yin energy was thick, seemingly protected by a great formation that kept the dense yin energy from leaking out.

Within the dense yin aura, faint, unearthly wails echoed out, chilling the very bones.

As soon as Yang Kai and the other two arrived, a furious shout came from within: "Who goes there!"

"Fu Bo?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and called out.

"How dare you, junior, call this Lord by name! Are you seeking death?" the voice came again.

"Looks like you are Fu Bo," Yang Kai grinned, striding forward and disappearing into the yin energy. Ji Yao and Luan Feng hurried to follow.

The yin energy enveloping the mountain peak seemed to be for cultivation only, with no defensive or confusing effects. Yang Kai led Ji Yao and Luan Feng straight in, and the view ahead suddenly opened up.

A palace appeared before them.

Releasing his Divine Sense slightly, Yang Kai immediately sensed a powerful aura inside the palace.

Stepping inside, he saw a burly man standing there, his eyes exuding authority, his face gloomy.

His Netherworld Sect was, after all, a top force in the Eastern Territory, and even in the entire Star Realm, it was quite renowned. Now, someone had barged in, straight into his cultivation place. Naturally, Fu Bo was furious.

Sweeping his Divine Sense over them, he found Yang Kai was only at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, which made his anger burn even hotter.

Still, as a Sect Master, Fu Bo's experience was far beyond ordinary. Seeing Yang Kai walk in so calmly, without a hint of nervousness, he instinctively felt this man was no ordinary person. Otherwise, how could he dare call him by name and break in here?

"Who are you people? Why have you trespassed in my Netherworld Sect?" Fu Bo asked coldly.

Yang Kai glanced around, then smiled slightly. "I am Yang Kai. I wonder if Sect Master Fu has heard of me?"

"Yang Kai?" Fu Bo frowned. "That name sounds familiar..."

After thinking for a moment, his expression changed and he said in a low voice, "Are you the enemy of Lesheng?"

Yin Lesheng was his personal disciple, in whom Fu Bo had placed great hopes. After what happened in the Shattered Star Sea, Yin Lesheng had not hidden anything from him and had mentioned Yang Kai's name.

But since it was a grudge among the younger generation, Fu Bo hadn't bothered to intervene, only telling Yin Lesheng to cultivate more and take revenge himself in the future.

Little did Fu Bo expect that Yin Lesheng, impatient and restless, after staying in the Netherworld Sect for a while, urged Hua Feichen to accompany him to the Wild Ancient Land to seek trouble with Yang Kai. When word of their departure leaked out, Fu Bo immediately ordered the Vice Sect Master Wu Yuanzheng to take some men and go support them, lest his disciple encounter any mishap in that wild place.

But what he hadn't expected was that before his disciple and the Vice Sect Master returned, this Yang Kai had shown up here.

"So Sect Master Fu does know me," Yang Kai chuckled and nodded. "That makes things easier."

Fu Bo ignored him, his face as dark as water. He said slowly, "As far as this Lord knows, Lesheng went to find you. On your way here, did you see this Lord's useless disciple?"

"I did," Yang Kai replied with a smile. "With him was someone named Hua Feichen, who I believe is an Elder of your Sect!"

Fu Bo's heart instantly sank. He asked in a low voice, "Where are they?"

Yang Kai grinned. "Sect Master Fu, you seem to understand the situation. They went to cause me trouble, but here I am, safe and sound. What do you think happened to them? You yourself said your disciple was useless. I was merciful and helped you clean house. No need to thank me!"

Fu Bo's chest surged with Qi and blood, and he roared, "Impossible!"

Yang Kai said coldly, "Wu Yuanzheng said the same thing before he died!"

"What!" Fu Bo was truly shocked now. "Even Vice Sect Master Wu is dead?"

After a moment, Fu Bo calmed down and snorted, "Brat, you're spouting nonsense. This Lord was almost fooled by you. With your meager strength, even Elder Hua could easily deal with you. How could you possibly kill Vice Sect Master Wu? What a joke!"

Yang Kai said indifferently, "It's true my strength is inferior to Wu Yuanzheng's, but I never said I killed him. The one who killed him... was someone else!"

Fu Bo frowned, feeling Yang Kai wasn't lying. His heart skipped a beat, and he quickly released his Divine Sense again to probe the two women beside Yang Kai.

The woman with the icy aura had impressive cultivation, actually at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm, which surprised Fu Bo.

When he tried to probe Luan Feng, he suddenly sensed a terrifying Divine Sense pressing toward him. Startled, he involuntarily stepped back a few paces and exclaimed, "Who are you, Senior!"

Only now did he realize how unfathomable this beautiful woman was.

Standing there, she gave him the feeling of facing a Great Emperor!

As the Sect Master of the Netherworld Sect, Fu Bo had seen Great Emperors before. In the Eastern Territory, he had met Great Emperor Youhun more than once.

Every time he went to the Soul Palace to meet the Great Emperor, his mood was just like now—extremely uneasy, as if the other could take his life with a wave of the hand.

This young man actually had a Great Emperor at his side? Who was he really?

Compared to that, Fu Bo was even more eager to know this beautiful woman's identity.

Luan Feng snorted softly, but had no intention of revealing her identity.

After all, as a Divine Spirit, coming to a human Sect was already improper. Unless necessary, she didn't want to expose herself.

"Does Sect Master Fu believe me now?" Yang Kai looked at Fu Bo with a leisurely smile.

Fu Bo swallowed, glancing warily at Luan Feng, then at Yang Kai, realizing Yang Kai was the one in charge. He nodded. "With this Senior's strength, Wu Yuanzheng likely had no chance of surviving."

If Wu Yuanzheng was dead, then Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen naturally had no chance either.

What he didn't know was that both Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen had been killed by Yang Kai, and it had nothing to do with Luan Feng.

Sighing, Fu Bo said dejectedly, "Since my useless disciple offended you, his death is deserved! However... the grudge between you and my disciple was personal. Now that he has paid with his life, may I ask what business you have at my Netherworld Sect?"
