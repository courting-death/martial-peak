## Chapter 2288 — Did He Die Just Like That?

At the same time, the other three Blood Saber cultivators also rapidly changed their hand seals, their expressions solemn.

Buzz...

A strange sound suddenly rang out, and Origin Qi surged from the four of them, halos undulating around them.

Yang Kai's expression changed. He realized that at this moment, the power of these four had produced a tremendous resonance, tightly linking them together.

"Immovable... as a mountain!" The Mountain character cultivator, who had not spoken until now, suddenly shouted, his face flushing red as he slammed both palms down into the void. With a thunderous boom, a massive mountain phantom appeared behind him, flashed, and then merged into his body.

An invisible ripple spread out from him as the center, transforming into a strange force that locked down the surrounding world.

He sat cross-legged in the void, closed his eyes, and became as still as an old monk in meditation, unmoving and unresponsive to the outside world.

Boom...

At that moment, Yang Kai's Myriad Sword also slashed down. The Wind character cultivator, who bore the brunt of the attack, curled his lips into a mocking smile.

Crack...

The sword struck three inches in front of the Wind character cultivator, its sharp sword Qi slicing through the black hair on his forehead and even tearing a bloody gash in his skin, but it failed to kill him as Yang Kai had hoped.

The Myriad Sword was actually blocked by an invisible barrier.

"What the hell!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed in disbelief as he stared at the Wind character cultivator. He could see clearly that the other party had made no defensive move, yet had miraculously blocked his lethal strike.

Just as Yang Kai was shocked, the Wind character cultivator pointed a finger at his chest, wind and clouds swirling at the fingertip, containing immense power.

In his haste, Yang Kai raised his sword to block.

The finger struck the blade of the Myriad Sword dead on.

In the next instant, Yang Kai's expression changed dramatically as he felt a tremendous force from ahead. It was as if a mountain had crashed into him, sending him flying backward uncontrollably, his momentum thrown into chaos.

While he was still in midair, a fiery red figure silently attacked. The Fire character cultivator, wielding a Blood Saber, swept up a cloud of fire and struck down at Yang Kai.

"Young Master Yang, be careful!" Ye Qinghan's pretty face turned pale as she cried out in alarm.

Whoosh whoosh...

Wind swept up fire clouds, the two different forces merging perfectly, instantly dyeing the world a fiery red.

Yang Kai could naturally sense the ferocity of this move. As his face changed and he was about to teleport away, a crackling explosion sounded behind him. The Thunder character cultivator had appeared like a ghost behind Yang Kai, striking at his back with a palm.

The palm landed solidly. Yang Kai couldn't dodge at all. In an instant, thunder surged, lightning flashed wildly like a horde of demons, and Yang Kai's body was paralyzed by the thunder and lightning, immediately swallowed by the fire cloud.

The coordination of the Wind, Thunder, and Fire trio was brought to the peak, their timing flawless. It was as if one person had split into several bodies to attack at once. In just a few moves, Yang Kai was plunged into a hopeless situation.

Ye Qinghan's face turned ashen as she watched, her eyes trembling as she stared at the burning fire cloud, asking herself over and over: Is he dead? Did he die just like that?

It was undeniable that Yang Kai was the most powerful Dao Origin Realm cultivator she had ever met. His commanding presence, unrestrained demeanor, and unfathomable methods all made her yearn and admire him, secretly believing that Yang Kai would surely achieve great things in the future.

Yet such a person was actually killed before her eyes.

And killed so easily. Ye Qinghan simply couldn't believe it.

Swish swish swish...

The Wind, Thunder, and Fire character cultivators appeared leisurely, standing side by side in midair, their eyes coldly fixed below.

Fire Ghost snorted disdainfully, "Aren't the higher-ups making a mountain out of a molehill? This brat doesn't seem all that impressive to me."

The Wind character cultivator frowned, focusing on the movement within the fire cloud. He snapped, "You went too far with your attack! The higher-ups told us to capture him alive, not bring back a corpse. If he's really dead, how are we supposed to explain ourselves?"

The Fire character cultivator's face changed slightly, realizing something was wrong, but he still insisted, "How was I supposed to know this brat was so fragile? He couldn't even take a single move... So what do we do now?"

The Wind character cultivator snorted, "You deal with the mess you made yourself. I'll report everything truthfully when we get back."

The Thunder character cultivator frowned, "Enough arguing. We don't even know if he's dead yet. Maybe this brat is just seriously injured. Fire Ghost, go check."

The Fire character cultivator was displeased at being ordered, but still flickered into the fire cloud to investigate.

The Wind and Thunder character cultivators waited anxiously, afraid that Yang Kai had really died. After all, the order from above was to capture Yang Kai alive. If they accidentally killed him, their good days would be over. The punishments within Blood Saber were not something they could bear.

The fire cloud continued to burn fiercely, as if it would never end. Inside, all was silent, and after Fire Ghost entered, there was no response for a long while.

The Thunder and Wind character cultivators exchanged glances, both sensing that something was wrong.

At that moment, a sudden change occurred.

A muffled grunt came from within the fire cloud, and Fire Ghost's figure shot out, spitting a mouthful of blood in midair.

"What!" The Thunder and Wind character cultivators' faces changed dramatically at the same time.

Swish swish swish...

A strange sound rang out from the fire cloud, as if sword intent was spreading, sword Qi crisscrossing. With this sound, the towering flames suddenly dispersed and vanished, leaving a figure standing quietly, his whole body shining with multicolored light.

"Young Master Yang!" Ye Qinghan looked at the figure radiating multicolored light and burst into tears of joy.

"Impossible!" Seeing Yang Kai's current state, the Wind and Thunder character cultivators cried out in shock, for they were horrified to find that Yang Kai didn't seem to be injured at all—he just looked a bit disheveled.

Moreover, the multicolored light radiating from him seemed to contain profound mysteries. From that five-colored glow, the two could clearly sense the pure power of the five elements. The power of the five elements appeared perfectly and simultaneously in one person, mutually restraining and generating, circulating endlessly, greatly boosting his aura.

"Be careful, this guy... is not easy to deal with!" Fire Ghost hurried back, wiping blood from his mouth, his eyes burning with fighting spirit as he stared at Yang Kai.

"Like we need you to tell us!" The Thunder and Wind character cultivators glanced at Fire Ghost.

"Sorry to have worried you all," Yang Kai said, waving his Myriad Sword as the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi swirled around him and a fierce grin crossed his face. "While I was resting, I figured out your combination technique. Wind, Thunder, Fire, Mountain—your powers resonate and merge, so you gain each other's strength in addition to your own..." He glanced at the Mountain character, who remained seated cross-legged in the void. "That Mountain brother handles defense and locks down the area, right? No wonder my teleportation didn't work earlier. If my body hadn't been tough enough, I would have suffered a great loss. Whoever created this combination technique is a genius." He looked genuinely impressed.

The Wind character cultivator's face changed slightly. "You figured out all that in such a short time?"

"That's right!" Yang Kai patted himself. "I even had time to change into clean clothes. I wonder if you all like them."

The Wind character cultivator's face turned truly ugly, because he realized Yang Kai really had changed clothes, not just joked about it.

The Thunder character cultivator said darkly, "There's a reason the higher-ups sent all four of us. This brat... can't be judged by common sense."

"No matter how strong he is, he's just at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm! The four of us together could even take on an ordinary Emperor, so why should we fear him?" Fire Ghost seemed a bit embarrassed and angry.

Hearing this, Ye Qinghan, who had just relaxed, immediately became anxious again.

If the four of them together could really fight an ordinary Emperor Realm cultivator, then Yang Kai surely had no chance. No matter how strong he was, it was only within the Dao Origin Realm. How could he compare to the Emperor Realm?

After a round of back-and-forth, the three fell silent, their gazes heavy as they stared at Yang Kai.

On the other side, Yang Kai smiled calmly, as if nothing could faze him.

A chilling, murderous atmosphere slowly spread.

Ye Qinghan felt cold all over, as if she had fallen into an ice cellar. The omnipresent killing intent seemed to pierce her skin, making her unbearably uncomfortable.

She knew that with her strength, she couldn't help Yang Kai in this battle, so she simply avoided causing him trouble and slipped to the side.

At a certain moment, the clashing killing intent exploded like gunpowder, and the atmosphere changed abruptly. Fire Ghost shouted, "Kill!"

As the shout rang out, the Thunder character cultivator, the fastest, instantly appeared before Yang Kai, raising a hand high. Thunder surged in his palm as he struck down, crackling sounds filling the air.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as he snorted, "Three Thousand Sword Dao, Seal!"

As the ultimate move appeared, sword light like a strip of white silk cut through the air, spreading around Yang Kai and slashing toward the Thunder character cultivator.

Yet the Thunder character cultivator showed no fear. The corner of his mouth curled up, and his figure blurred—then, in the blink of an eye, he vanished completely. In his place, Fire Ghost appeared like a phantom from several dozen zhang away, suddenly materializing right in front of Yang Kai.

"Transposition Shift!" Yang Kai's expression changed.

Fire Ghost swept his long saber, fire clouds howling as he shouted, "Blazing Fire Sweeps the Plains!"

Boom boom boom...

Sword Qi and flames collided, producing violent sounds. For a moment, Spiritual Qi was thrown into chaos, the void trembled, and spiritual energy splashed in all directions, shooting to the four corners.

"Thunderstorm!" The Thunder character cultivator had somehow appeared to Yang Kai's left. With a single palm, several bolts of lightning as thick as an arm appeared above Yang Kai's head, crashing down wildly.
