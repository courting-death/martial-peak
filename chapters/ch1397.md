## Chapter 1397 — Please Enter the Trap

Careless movement will only trigger more of the formations and hasten your march into the grave.

Sure enough, Dragon Lair Mountain was riddled with formations, each step fraught with danger; more than eighty Saint King Realm cultivators were completely annihilated within less than half an incense-stick's time after entering — not a single one survived.

Ning Xiangchen could hardly believe his eyes!

Those were over eighty Saint King Realm warriors — even if he himself had encountered them he could at best have skirted the edge of their blades; yet here at Dragon Lair Mountain, without expending a single soldier or anyone even lifting a hand, they were all sent to their graves.

What are dragon pits and tiger lairs compared to this? This little hill was even more terrifying than a dragon pit or tiger lair.

Ning Xiangchen also saw that sheer formation power alone could not so effortlessly eliminate eighty Saint King Realm — the hand that had laid the arrays was truly horrifying.

The things serving as the formation's eyes were, astonishingly, potent Secret Treasures! Coupled with the formation's might, these treasures' power was greatly amplified, which is why those Saint King Realm cultivators had absolutely no strength to resist.

How many Secret Treasures would be needed to deploy so many formations? Ning Xiangchen could not imagine.

Elsewhere in Tianyun City, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were likewise aghast; they exchanged a look of utter astonishment. Although they knew Dragon Lair Mountain must be riddled with formations, they had never imagined such overwhelming power.

They had thrown in eighty Saint King Realm and still could not probe Dragon Lair Mountain's depths — now the Xie Family and the Demon Blood Sect of Myriad Beasts Mountain had suffered a grievous loss.

"It looks like the Tianluo Hall people don't even need to take action!" Wei Guchang jeered nearby.

"Not necessarily!" Fei Zhi Tu shook his head slowly. "They only lost Saint King Realm cultivators. The Origin Returning Realm haven't acted yet — keep watching."

Wei Guchang pondered for a moment and agreed; after all, the power an Origin Returning Realm can exert is entirely different from that of a Saint King Realm. Though the Xie Family and the allied parties appeared to have suffered severely, in truth their sinews and bones were not truly harmed.

Outside Dragon Lair Mountain, Xie Li, the Elder surnamed Du of Myriad Beasts Mountain, and the middle-aged man from the Demon Blood Sect all wore sullen faces; each expression was hideous. No one could have imagined Dragon Lair Mountain's defenses were so mighty — those three old men hadn't even acted and yet dozens of Saint King Realm were slain.

If the formations inside Dragon Lair Mountain were all this powerful, then Saint King Realm cultivators could exert little effect here and would only be cannon fodder.

After a moment's thought, Xie Li suddenly said, "Everyone, shall we strike from multiple directions?"

"Strike from multiple directions?" Elder Du of Myriad Beasts Mountain frowned.

"Yes. The formations on the front hills appear numerous and are not easily breached. Given that, try other approaches. I do not believe the whole hill is like this — there must be weak points," Xie Li said slowly.

"Hmm, Brother Xie speaks reasonably." Elder Du considered and agreed, then said, "Then I will go that way."

He pointed, then beckoned to Myriad Beasts Mountain's disciples. The Green-Eyed Blood Toad leapt from its seat and shot off to the side.

The middle-aged man from the Demon Blood Sect had no objection either and immediately led his disciples in the opposite direction.

The remaining people from Haixin Sect's Liu Yun Valley did not move; instead they chose to stand united with the Xie Family, following Xie Li's lead.

In an instant, the allied forces split into three routes, probing Dragon Lair Mountain's defenses for weak points from three directions.

A ruthless gleam flashed in Xie Li's eyes; his lips moved as he issued several orders, then he waved his hand and actually led the charge toward Dragon Lair Mountain. Under his lead, the other Origin Returning Realm spread out, each taking some Saint King Realm warriors. They divided into several teams, wary of their surroundings as they advanced.

Divine senses swept over every inch of Dragon Lair Mountain as the attackers probed, unwilling to miss any detail or suspicious spot. They feared that carelessly triggering a formation would lead to irrevocable doom.

Such caution indeed proved effective.

They actually found traces of several formations and avoided them with extreme care; even if someone occasionally triggered a formation, it would not render them utterly powerless as before.

After all, with Origin Returning Realm experts now present, even if one fell into a formation, there was still room to fight back.

What delighted them further was that the formations on Dragon Lair Mountain's front hills, having expended their miraculous effect earlier, now seemed exhausted with greatly reduced power; even when triggered they were successfully withstood by the Origin Returning Realm warriors.

They pushed forward a full one hundred zhang without a single casualty. Morale surged and everyone glared maliciously at the three — Chang Qi and the others — not far off, still drinking and carousing, as if they wished they could sprout wings and fly over to lop off the three men's heads to vent their hatred.

After a moment, many warriors under Xie Li's lead had come within ten zhang of Chang Qi and the other two. Xie Li raised his hand to signal a stop, coldly appraising the three with a frosty expression and sneering, "Gentlemen, if you have any tricks left, don't hide them — use them all now so I can see. Otherwise you'll have no further chance."

At his words, Chang Qi looked up, showing no hint of alarm; instead he smiled strangely. "Brother Xie, do you think you could have come here so safely? Do you really think Dragon Lair Mountain is so easy to breach?"

Those two casual questions made Xie Li's face change wildly; he cried, "No good!"

As he spoke he lashed out a jet-black long whip; wind and thunder seemed to howl from it, lightning flashing—clearly a fearsome Secret Treasure. The whip, like an ocean Jiao, struck toward Chang Qi's chest.

What puzzled Xie Li was that Chang Qi made no move to defend; he remained seated, smiling at him without stirring.

Xie Li had only intended to seize Chang Qi to force Dragon Lair Mountain's defenders into caution; who could have known that after his thunderous blow, the other would offer no resistance?

"Courting death!" A vicious light flashed in Xie Li's eyes; he did not intend to withdraw the whip, but poured even more Saint Yuan into it, intent on annihilating Chang Qi in one stroke.

With a boom, the whip wrapped in lightning struck Chang Qi's body. Arcs danced and electric serpents writhed; Chang Qi's body was blasted to pieces. The table, chairs and wine jars before him were all shattered to powder, and even Hao An and Ning Xiangchen were not spared.

As Chang Qi's body was torn apart, the two of them also burst apart in the same manner.

There was no smell of blood, no splattering gore, and no sense of having struck something solid. Xie Li's eyes shrank in horror as he exclaimed, "An illusion formation?"

Looking again, there were no tables or chairs; the surroundings twisted and vanished, replaced by a gray, murky world with no sun, moon, or stars. The earth was parched, and for a hundred li in every direction not a blade of grass grew.

He had unknowingly stepped into an illusion formation laid by the enemy, and Xie Li's heart sank into the abyss.

Worse, the Origin Returning Realm warriors who should have been clustered around him were nowhere to be seen; only four Saint Kings remained by his side.

It seemed that the moment the illusion formation took effect everyone was separated, each plunged into solitary combat.

"How is this possible?" Xie Li's face contorted. How could a mere small hill have arranged such profound formations? He suddenly felt that provoking Dragon Lair Mountain might not have been a wise decision.

While Xie Li and the many warriors under him were wrapped by the illusion formation, the Myriad Beasts Mountain side also tumbled into bitter fighting.

Under Elder Du's lead, the Myriad Beasts Mountain warriors flanked around to seek weak points. To his surprise, all went smoothly; his chosen direction seemed free of fierce formations and formations, allowing him to press forward and soon almost reach the central area of Dragon Lair Mountain.

He even sensed many warriors hiding inside a cave.

Overjoyed, Elder Du immediately ordered a direct strike, preparing to drive straight into the cave's location to fetch out Yang Kai.

But his luck ended there: no sooner had his order been given than from all directions surged forth demonic beasts of varying shapes and tiers, their bodies blazing crimson.

Elder Du could hardly believe his eyes; these beasts had no real bodies, clearly formed from pure fire-type Spiritual Qi, and he felt an odd sense of familiarity about them.

Only when one of his disciples shouted did he suddenly realize — weren't these the Fire Spirit Beasts unique to the Flowing Flame Sandland?

How could they appear in this cursed place? This area wasn't particularly rich in fire-type Spiritual Qi!

Puzzled but unafraid, Elder Du was instead a little delighted; Fire Spirit Beasts produce Crystal Stones, and Crystal Stones are prized — useful for forging or alchemy. Unfortunately, Crystal Stones are only obtainable on Dark Star when the Flowing Flame Sandland opens.

With such a multitude of Fire Spirit Beasts before him, the harvest from slaughtering them all would certainly be large.

Buoyed by the thought, Elder Du drove his Green-Eyed Blood Toad and launched into fierce battle with the Fire Spirit Beasts.

Soon he noticed something amiss: however many Fire Spirit Beasts he slain, not a single Crystal Stone appeared — these beasts simply did not contain Crystal Stones.

Instead they seemed endless, inexhaustible by slaughter. The leading few, with strength comparable to Ninth-Tier demonic beasts, had already caused many casualties among his disciples.

Furious, Elder Du unleashed secret techniques and with thunderous power scattered those Fire Spirit Beasts.

Infuriatingly quick, those Ninth-Tier-level Fire Spirit Beasts inexplicably reappeared from who knew where, as if they were immortal.

This repeated several times; Elder Du grumbled inwardly and grew anxious.

Though Fire Spirit Beasts are not hard to deal with individually, a swarm can still fell an elephant. If this continued, aside from the Origin Returning Realm cultivators who might escape, no one else would hope to leave alive.
