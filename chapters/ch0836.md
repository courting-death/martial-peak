## Chapter 836 — You Little Brat

Ling Jian stood at the mouth of the valley, anxiously waiting, muttering to himself, yet Sun Yu did not emerge from Dragon Valley.

Gradually, Ling Jian even feared that in that terrifying outpouring of heavenly-and-earth power just now, his disciple had perished.

Just as he was panic-stricken and at a loss, a lithe figure came racing from the direction of Dragon Valley; Ling Jian's body trembled and he widened his eyes to stare that way.

The figure bore some resemblance to Sun Yu but was taller and more robust than the image in his memory; Ling Jian's sight, dull with age, couldn't make a quick confirmation, so he watched closely.

After a moment, the newcomer's face finally entered Ling Jian's view. When he confirmed it was Sun Yu, tears streamed down his face in an instant—half laughing, half crying as he cursed, "You little brat, you finally came out! You scared the life out of me!"

"Master!" Sun Yu wore an expression of unbounded excitement and hurriedly rushed to Ling Jian, performing a deep salute. Before he could say more, Ling Jian grabbed him and urged, "Come with me!"

Seeing his demeanor, Sun Yu asked suspiciously, "Where to?"

"Youhan Grotto-Heaven has invaded. The palace head and the others are meeting them, but the enemy has two cultivators at the Saint Realm—we can't stop them. Before leaving, the palace head told me to take you to safety once you emerged. The future revival of our sect depends on you."

"Where's a safe place?" Sun Yu frowned.

"The Twin Pavilion... Dragon-Phoenix Palace has long been on friendly terms with the Twin Pavilion. Go there to lie low for a while; we'll wait out this storm and deal with things afterward."

Ling Jian had already settled on the destination: his disciple Sun Yu had inherited the Dragon Emperor's legacy and would one day grow into a regional hegemon. He urgently needed to find a suitable maiden to inherit the Phoenix Nest's legacy; once Twin Pavilion learned of this, they would surely protect them properly.

Owing them this favor, it wouldn't be unreasonable for Sun Yu to find a Phoenix Empress within Twin Pavilion.

In any case, the Phoenix Empress's inheritance must not fall into the hands of an enemy like Youhan Grotto-Heaven.

"I'm not leaving!" Sun Yu suddenly broke free of Ling Jian's grasp, planting his feet and shouting.

Ling Jian froze for a moment, then turned to look at him and stamped his foot anxiously. "You little brat. At a time like this you still won't listen to your master—do you want to kill me with worry?"

Sun Yu snorted coldly, "The sect is in peril—how can I just run away? If Youhan Grotto-Heaven dares to invade, I'll make them pay!"

Ling Jian couldn't help but stare, bewildered, at his disciple, utterly at a loss to understand the situation.

Though the disciple had inherited the Dragon Emperor's legacy, where did he get such confidence? Claiming he'd make Youhan Grotto-Heaven pay—did he really have the ability?

Ling Jian sent out his divine sense and swept it over Sun Yu. When he sensed his current realm, his eyes nearly popped out and he gasped, "You..."

"Make us pay? Hahahaha—what arrogance!" A loud laugh suddenly came from the side.

With that mocking voice, several shadowy figures materialized from the surrounding area like ghosts; each wore moon-white robes that made them appear impeccably clean.

Sun Yu's expression changed and he instinctively stepped behind Ling Jian. Ling Jian's face hardened as he shielded his disciple and coldly surveyed their surroundings, growling, "People from Youhan Grotto-Heaven!"

The newcomers were indeed from Youhan Grotto-Heaven—five in total—and all were Transcendent Realm cultivators.

With that number and caliber of cultivators, facing a near-blind old Ling Jian who was only a First Stage Transcendent was hopeless.

They therefore appeared with full confidence, leisurely eyeing the master and his disciple with thinly veiled malice.

The leader, a middle-aged man, appraised Sun Yu with a sneer and jeered, "Kid, are you the one who just said you'd make us from Youhan Grotto-Heaven pay?"

Sun Yu went pale and didn't dare make a sound.

Although Yang Kai had greatly nurtured him—improving his aptitude and boosting his cultivation—he was still only a sixteen- or seventeen-year-old youth who'd never seen much of the world. Now, faced with five Transcendent Realm opponents, his courage drained away before the fight even began; without his master protecting him, his fighting spirit would likely have collapsed.

Hiding behind Ling Jian, he cast anxious glances around as if searching for something. After a moment his face brightened and his panic subsided.

The middle-aged man, having said his piece, stopped paying attention to Ling Jian and the youth. He and the other four turned their gazes toward the bottom of Dragon Valley, stroking his chin and saying, "That strange heavenly phenomenon just now must have come from in there, right?"

"Yes. This is said to be Dragon-Phoenix Palace's Dragon Valley, where some Dragon Emperor legacy is hidden. We never believed it—until now. Chen Zhou and the others have been guarding here these past two years."

"So someone from Dragon-Phoenix Palace must have obtained the Dragon Emperor legacy?"

"Indeed. We've already inquired—who entered was called Sun Yu, and his cultivation was only True Yuan Realm, Seventh Stage!"

"That kid's lucky—go in and take a look; if we catch him, we'll grab him!"

The five Transcendent cultivators completely ignored Ling Jian and his disciple as they continued to discuss among themselves.

Ling Jian had been on tenterhooks, but upon hearing their conversation realized an opportunity: they apparently didn't recognize that the youth before them was the Sun Yu they sought.

After all, they had never seen Sun Yu before and his cultivation had changed so drastically that they made the mistaken assumption he was still inside and hadn't emerged.

"Sirs..." Ling Jian spoke cautiously, "If you intend to enter, I won't stop you, but could you let us leave first?"

"Want to leave?" The leader glanced at him and laughed softly, then said, "Fine—let the kid cut out his own tongue! He dared to say he'd make us from Youhan Grotto-Heaven pay; that tongue only invites trouble. It's useless—sooner or later it'll get him killed."

Ling Jian's expression changed and he forced a smile, "My disciple was young and ignorant—I'm here to apologize on his behalf. Please, sirs, show mercy and spare him this once."

"Hahaha!" The five from Youhan Grotto-Heaven laughed aloud, amused.

The middle-aged man sneered, "We could spare him—young people make mistakes, and we don't wish to bully the weak... Hmm, since he's your disciple, have you take the punishment instead. Kneel and kowtow a few times, then loudly say your Dragon-Phoenix Palace is worse than swine and dogs, and I'll consider letting him go. How about that?"

He stared at Ling Jian as if coercing him.

Ling Jian's face turned cold. Though aged and frail, he had reached the Transcendent Realm in cultivation; his blood and pride still burned within him.

How could he not be angered at such brazen humiliation from the middle-aged man?

But remembering the palace head Chen Zhou's earlier instructions, Ling Jian suppressed his fury. He cast a humiliated glance at the middle-aged man, expression impassive, and the old body slowly sank to his knees.

The middle-aged man's eyes flashed with mockery as he let out a light, cold laugh.

"Master..." Sun Yu suddenly reached out and steadied Ling Jian. His youthful face had gone dark as the calm before a storm; the earlier timidity and terror seemed vanished, replaced by eyes that shone with hatred and killing intent.

"You little brat..." Ling Jian glared at him.

Sun Yu slowly shook his head, then stepped forward to stand before Ling Jian and said to the five across from them, "You're here for Sun Yu, right?"

"Kid, you talk too much," the middle-aged man replied, displeased.

"I am Sun Yu. You don't need to look inside any further!"

The middle-aged man was stunned and stared at Sun Yu in astonishment; the other four wore the same expression.

"Don't doubt it!" Sun Yu sneered. "When I entered, I really only had True Yuan Realm, Seventh Stage cultivation, but that was two years ago!"

"Two years to cross an entire realm?" the middle-aged man blurted in shock.

Sun Yu was now Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm—a full realm above True Yuan Seventh Stage. Because of this vast power gap, none of them had expected the boy before them to be Sun Yu.

Another of the five's eyes lit up, "Could this be the power of that so-called Dragon Emperor legacy?"

"If you want to think that... fine!" Sun Yu snorted lightly, wearing an air of calm; facing five Transcendent Realm experts, there was not the slightest hint of fear—he was a different person from before.

The five from Youhan Grotto-Heaven were instantly stirred by his words.

To grow from True Yuan Realm Seventh Stage to Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage in two years—this was nothing short of a miracle. They immediately realized how tremendous the Dragon Emperor legacy's power must be.

Their gazes toward Sun Yu grew fervent.

"You little brat!" Ling Jian spat blood in anger.

Those five lackwits had failed to recognize his identity; if they had only taken advantage of a little humiliation, they could have left with a chance to get away. As long as Sun Yu was kept safe, Ling Jian could have borne any insult. But the fool had admitted everything himself—wasn't he setting himself on fire?

He wondered whether his disciple's head had a hole; he'd never seemed this dense before. Though not especially gifted or smooth, he had never been so stupid.

What happened to him after a trip to Dragon Valley that made him change so drastically?

Ling Jian wanted nothing more than to slap his disciple unconscious so he would stop babbling.

"Master... it's fine!" Sun Yu smiled faintly and nodded to his master, resolute.

Seeing that smile, Ling Jian felt something shift inside him—calm washed over him inexplicably, and the pressure from the five Transcendent Realm opponents seemed to lighten.

He gave a wry laugh. "Very well. Since things have come to this, your master will accompany you—our fate will decide life or death for the two of us."

"We won't die. If anyone dies, it will be them!" Sun Yu's tone grew cold and his gaze turned icy as he stared at the five, like a sharpened blade aimed straight at their eyes, radiating an overwhelming, hostile force.

The five involuntarily took a step back, faces grave and brows tightly knit.
