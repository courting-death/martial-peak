## Chapter 2403 — Children Shouldn’t Watch

This five-colored spear was actually Yao Changjun’s Imperial Treasure!

Imperial Treasures are rare even among Emperor Realm experts; each one is regarded as a priceless treasure and never discarded lightly. Yet now, Yao Changjun’s Imperial Treasure had appeared in Yang Kai’s hands. What did this mean? It meant that Yao Changjun was most likely doomed!

No wonder he hadn’t seen Yao Changjun at all. Ever since arriving in the Jixu Secret Realm, he’d even run into Yang Kai, but never caught a trace of Yao Changjun. Now it seemed it wasn’t that Yao Changjun was hiding well, but that he was no longer in this world.

But... how could Yang Kai, just a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, possibly have killed Yao Changjun? If he wasn’t the one who did it, then how did the five-colored spear end up in his hands?

Pang Guang was completely baffled, staring blankly at the five-colored spear, unable to make sense of it. He didn’t know whether Yang Kai was telling the truth or not.

Just as his mind was reeling, a sudden chill swept over him from behind. The cold came without warning, and by the time Pang Guang sensed it and tried to dodge, it was already too late.

A streak of light flashed like a whip, accompanied by a beastly roar that echoed like a tiger’s cry through the mountains. Pang Guang only felt a sharp pain in his back, then his body was struck by a tremendous force, sending him flying forward uncontrollably, blood spraying from his mouth as he tumbled through the air.

Before Pang Guang could steady himself, Yang Kai was already upon him, a savage grin twisting his face. With a fist wreathed in dense spatial energy, Yang Kai struck down. Wherever his fist passed, a pitch-black scar was left in the air, as if even space itself had been shattered.

Pang Guang sucked in a cold breath, forcibly gathering his Origin Qi and urging the bronze gong to shield himself.

Boom...

A thunderous crash rang out. The bronze gong’s light flared wildly, and under this blow, even the spirit of the Imperial Treasure seemed damaged, making Pang Guang’s heart ache.

But now was clearly not the time to feel sorry for the Imperial Treasure. Pang Guang’s face turned pale as he used the recoil to rapidly widen the distance between himself and Yang Kai.

Ssshh—

A faint sound rang out, and an extremely dangerous aura coiled around his heart. For a brief instant, the world grew dazzlingly bright. Then, a thread-thin bolt of lightning shot from somewhere, striking Pang Guang dead-on.

Even though Pang Guang was an Emperor Realm expert, after being hit by that bolt of lightning, his whole body convulsed uncontrollably, his hair standing on end, the stench of burnt flesh rising from him—he looked utterly miserable.

Eyes bulging with rage, he forced himself to turn and look to the side. In the next instant, his eyes went wide.

Over there, a little girl of about seven or eight, exquisitely delicate yet with a face full of icy coldness, sat astride a white tiger, holding a pale blue orb in her hand, staring at him coldly.

Neither the little girl nor the white tiger beneath her had given any warning of their appearance. Pang Guang had no idea how they’d shown up. Clearly, all the earlier sneak attacks and assaults had come from this pair.

What Pang Guang found hardest to believe was that the pale blue orb in the little girl’s hand was actually a lightning-attribute Imperial Treasure! Whether it was because her cultivation was lacking or for some other reason, after unleashing the Imperial Treasure’s power, the little girl’s face was now pale—obviously, she’d exhausted herself.

What was going on! Pang Guang’s mind couldn’t keep up; everything he saw and heard was simply too unbelievable.

Just then, an angry shout rang out: “Pang Guang, today, this place will be your grave. Prepare to die!”

Pang Guang shuddered in fright, no longer daring to underestimate Yang Kai in the slightest. He’d charged in full of murderous intent, hoping to kill Yang Kai and avenge his humiliation, but instead he’d blundered into a trap and been beaten half to death before his enemy had even done much.

That white tiger-like beast radiated an aura that only Emperor Realm experts possessed—it was clearly not to be trifled with. Pang Guang doubted he could handle just the beast alone, let alone with Yang Kai lurking nearby, watching him like a hungry wolf. There was simply no way to win this fight.

If he’d known it would be this dangerous, he’d never have come. Wouldn’t it have been better to stay over there cheering for Chi Ri?

For a moment, Pang Guang was filled with endless regret. He turned to flee.

"Condense!" Yang Kai, seeing his intent, shouted explosively. As Spatial Laws gathered, the surrounding space instantly became viscous, trapping Pang Guang and making every step a struggle.

That instant of delay sealed Pang Guang’s fate.

Under Liu Yan’s command, the White Tiger turned into a streak of light, flashing to Pang Guang’s side and clamping its bloody jaws around his neck.

Pang Guang was scared out of his wits, pouring all his strength into protecting his neck to keep it from being bitten through, while desperately struggling to break free.

“Get in there!” Yang Kai sneered, tossing the Xuan Realm Pearl toward Pang Guang, instantly swallowing him, the White Tiger, and Liu Yan all at once.

Immediately after, Yang Kai’s figure flickered as he too entered the Small Xuan Realm.

Somewhere inside the Small Xuan Realm, Pang Guang, after exhausting himself and even burning his Essence-Blood, finally managed to shake off the White Tiger. But when he turned around, he was completely dumbfounded.

Looking around, this was no ocean at all—lush greenery, birdsong, fragrant flowers, and dense Spiritual Qi everywhere. It was like a paradise.

Could he be dead already? Was this the underworld? Cold sweat poured down Pang Guang’s forehead.

Fortunately, a moment later he spotted Yang Kai, and his heart eased a little.

But after all that torment, and with his previous wounds still unhealed, Pang Guang now looked nothing like an Emperor Realm expert—he was the very picture of a beaten dog, utterly wretched.

Yang Kai looked at him coldly, as if watching a dead man.

Pang Guang’s gaze wandered, his heart shaken to its core. He cried out in shock, “What is this place?!”

Yang Kai chuckled darkly. “Naturally, it’s your grave. Look how considerate I am, choosing such a fine spot for your burial. Others couldn’t ask for a place like this. City Lord Pang, your ancestors must truly have piled up great virtue for the family tomb to be blessed with such fortune.”

Damn you and your family tomb! Pang Guang cursed inwardly, his stomach twisting with rage, yet he didn’t dare voice it aloud. Forcing himself to put on a hard front, he snapped, “If you want to kill me, let’s see whether you truly have the skill!”

As he spoke, he glanced warily at the white tiger.

He wasn’t actually that afraid of Yang Kai; what truly unsettled him was the white tiger radiating Emperor Realm aura. He didn’t know what it was—though it looked like a demonic beast, it had no Qi and blood fluctuations, like a dead thing, yet it seemed alive.

Yang Kai laughed, “In here, your life and death are at my whim. If I want you to live, you live. If I want you to die, you die!”

“You talk like you’re the master of heaven and earth. Careful you don’t burst from bragging!” Pang Guang sneered.

Yang Kai snorted, “You’re exactly right. In here, I am the master!”

As he spoke, Yang Kai reached out a hand toward Pang Guang from afar.

Pang Guang saw no sign of Yang Kai using any power or secret technique, but as that palm fell, he suddenly felt an immense pressure descend from above, making his bones creak and his straight back bend involuntarily.

Pang Guang’s face changed dramatically and he cried out, “Heaven and earth force! You can actually control the force of heaven and earth—impossible!”

Even the Great Emperors couldn’t control the force of heaven and earth! No such person existed. Yet Yang Kai truly was wielding that power, pinning Pang Guang down so hard he couldn’t even move a finger.

Pang Guang’s eyes trembled violently, his face twisted in utter terror. Under the crushing weight of that immense force, he couldn’t muster even a shred of strength—he felt as if his body might shatter into dust at any moment, panic flooding every inch of him.

He wanted to resist, but couldn’t summon any strength at all.

“Don’t kill him—leave him to me!” A thunderous voice suddenly boomed from the side, so deep and resonant it made Pang Guang’s eardrums ring.

In a daze, he looked up and was instantly stunned.

Not far away, a colossal, humanoid Stone Giant sat cross-legged, its eyes bigger than houses, staring at him hungrily.

That voice had just come from the Stone Giant.

Pang Guang’s feet cramped with fear. He’d noticed the Stone Giant before, but thought it was just a small mountain and hadn’t paid it any mind. Who would have thought it was alive—and could even speak!

The way it looked at him was like a starving wolf eyeing a fat sheep, its eyes glowing green, filling Pang Guang with terror.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and looked at the Incarnation. “You want to do that? Isn’t it a bit too cruel?”

The Incarnation grinned, “Just once in a while! You’ve killed so many Emperor Realm experts and never tossed one in here. Now that we finally have one, I can’t let him go.”

Yang Kai thought for a moment, then nodded, “As you wish.”

After speaking, he glanced at Pang Guang with a look of sympathy, then his figure flickered and he left the Small Xuan Realm.

“Hey, brat, where are you going? What do you mean, ‘too cruel’? Explain yourself!” Pang Guang shouted, a deep sense of unease welling up inside him, so strong it felt worse than death. His face turned white with fear.

He didn’t know what the Stone Giant intended, but from Yang Kai’s words and the look in his eyes before leaving, Pang Guang’s fate was clearly not going to be pleasant.

Just as Pang Guang was panicking, he suddenly noticed the light above his head was blocked. Looking up, he saw a giant palm descending toward him. Pang Guang immediately screamed, “Stop!”

The Incarnation ignored him, grabbed him up, and tossed him into its palm, rumbling, “Close your eyes, kid. Children shouldn’t watch, or you’ll be scarred for life.”

Pang Guang: “...”

The Incarnation’s expression turned solemn as it intoned, “Heaven Devouring... Battle Art!”
