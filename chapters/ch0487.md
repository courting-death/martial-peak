## Chapter 487 — Clash of the Mystery-Grade Treasures

The two Blood Servants exchanged calm glances. Suddenly, their True Yuan surged simultaneously, and a violent tendency gradually emerged.

Soon, whether it was Tang Yuxian or Ying Jiu, their Qi and blood surged rapidly. Their momentum and True Yuan shattered layer upon layer of previous limitations, breaking into a new realm.

Blood Fury Technique! Both of them now possessed cultivation equivalent to the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Whoosh, whoosh...

Their figures vanished simultaneously. In the night sky, only two streaks of red light were visible, constantly clashing against each other.

Di Mo ravaging among the crowd sensed these fluctuations and involuntarily looked up, his expressions slightly grave. "Indeed, they have some skill."

With the Blood Fury Technique empowering them, Di Mo believed that though these two might not be his match one-on-one, defeating them would still require some time.

Tang Yuxian had been restrained by Ying Jiu. Tu Feng was incapacitated by the Sealing Yuan Curse and unable to help. Now, Yang Kang had no one to guard him.

“Fifth Brother, please!” Yang Kai calmly fixed his gaze on him.

Yang Kang’s expression turned serious. He took a slow breath, a cold gleam flashed like lightning in his eyes, and his aura grew increasingly perilous—but his expression only grew calmer and calmer.

Not bad, Yang Kai thought to himself.

He suddenly realized that this Fifth Brother of his wasn’t so immature after all. Among the young generation with similar cultivation, he quite likely ranked among the elites.

In battle, the more furious one became, the easier it was to fall into a passive position.

Martial artists contend by momentum, cultivation, strategy, experience— and above all, by temperament.

If external factors disturb a fighter’s temperament during a clash, it becomes difficult to unleash their full strength, sometimes leaving fatal flaws.

A martial artist blinded by rage would find it hard to act rationally, allowing the opponent to control the fight’s tempo and potentially cost them their life.

Once Yang Kang prepared for battle, he immediately became calm—clearly embodying the demeanor of a seasoned expert. Given another twenty years, he would certainly rise to become a powerful figure in his own right—only now, he was still too young.

Yang Kai was even younger. Their experiences differed greatly, so naturally, their perspectives also varied.

“Ninth Brother, if you can spar with Liu Qingyao, that means I, Fifth Brother, am definitely no match for you,” Yang Kang said evenly, uttering those words without shame. “But if you want to defeat me, you’ll have to pay a price!”

As he spoke, a compass-like artifact suddenly appeared on his wrist.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted subtly, glancing at Yang Kang in shock. “Why bother?”

“I am of the Yang Family. You understand the temper of Yang family men!” Yang Kang sneered but remained indifferent.

Suddenly, arcs of electricity surged from the compass. The space around Yang Kang seemed to collapse, the atmosphere saturated with a dangerously potent aura spreading outward.

Yang Kai moved leisurely—like a lightning bolt, swift, decisive. He lashed out a fierce palm strike infused with his blazing True Yuan and radiant Yang Qi, coiling like a spirit serpent.

Yang Kang only stared calmly at the incoming palm strike, showing no sign of evasion.

Smash...

Yang Kang grunted and was flung backward, but laughing toward the heavens, he called out, “Ninth Brother, try the power of this Mystery-Grade treasure of mine!”

The compass in his hand seemed to devour all of his True Yuan in an instant, glowing brightly. The air was thick with ominous energy fluctuations.

Crackling...

Lightning bolts as thick as human thighs blasted forth from the compass. These thunderous dragons took the shape of sea dragons, flaunting two sharp horns on their heads. Each body stretched over ten zhang, moving sinuously, their blood-red jaws wide open, fiercely snapping at the pursuing Yang Kai.

Yang Kai abruptly halted, flickered several times, and immediately retreated over a hundred zhang.

The dragon-like electric attacks vanished into the night sky. Yet, Yang Kai’s spine chilled as if blown by a cold wind. Without hesitation, he unleashed the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia. One thousand fluttering petals formed an impenetrable defensive net around him.

Suddenly, the previously hidden electric dragons reappeared from all directions, launching another ferocious assault.

Petals danced and electric dragons writhed, clashing violently with explosive sounds.

Watching Yang Kai encased by the electric dragons, Yang Kang grinned bitterly. He did not bother with tentative attacks or hesitation; his first strike was his strongest. For he understood that against Ninth Brother’s cultivation, he had only one chance.

It was a pity... He had only refined this treasure halfway.

That compass was the Mystery-Grade treasure seized during the treasure war at Po Jing Lake. It contained the secrets and power of lightning—swift, piercing, and indomitable. Once fully refined, Yang Kang would be able to contend with fighters at the Fifth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

But Yang Kai did not give him the time.

His only option was to unleash this half-finished treasure in a final strike.

The price, however, was steep.

Without fully refining the treasure, Yang Kang could not fully control it. The moment the electric dragons erupted, he suffered massive backlash. Moreover, lightning dragons could only release power, never reclaim it. After a single strike, the compass was utterly ruined. It would require a master refiner to repair it and gather lightning energy anew to restore it.

Such a method was extremely harmful both to the user and the treasure itself, so until fully refined, no martial artist dared to use the artifact lightly.

This was unlike when Liu Qingyao sacrificed the Water Moon Azure Wave Armor. That Mystery-Grade treasure vanished without chance of repair, but the sacrifice did not harm Liu Qingyao herself.

Nonetheless... Yang Kang was satisfied.

No matter how strong Ninth Brother was, he could not withstand a strike from a Mystery-Grade treasure, right? If he could at least injure him, then Yang Kang's goal would be achieved—if he was to fall, Ninth Brother wouldn’t walk away unharmed!

Qiu Yimeng watched anxiously as Yang Kai was encased by the electric dragons. Her palms were slick with sweat. She clearly sensed the ferocity of those lightning dragons and wasn’t sure if Yang Kai could withstand the attack.

Yet, seeing Xiao Shun standing calmly nearby, expression unreadable, Qiu Yimeng quietly let her worries ease.

If Yang Kai were truly in mortal danger, Xiao Shun wouldn’t ignore it. Because he didn’t move, it meant Yang Kai’s life was secure.

Suddenly...

A flurry of bright red petals floated down through the air, drifting gracefully and releasing a fragrant aura.

The Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia’s defense... was breached!

Qiu Yimeng gasped in shock, barely catching her breath before a fierce suction force emerged exactly where Yang Kai stood.

A vortex seemed to be pulling the lightning dragons. No matter how much they struggled, they could not resist its devouring power.

Soon, the dazzling dragons of electricity vanished entirely. Yang Kai reappeared before everyone’s eyes, unharmed.

In his hand, he held a bone shield as large as a tabletop. The shield bore the open maw of a beast, terrifyingly fierce.

Within the beast’s mouth, faint flickers of electric sparks shimmered.

“Mystery-Grade treasures are indeed formidable,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head. The Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia could not withstand the Mystery-Grade compass’s attack, so he was forced to summon the bone shield and swallow those electric dragons.

“Damn!” Seeing this, Yang Kang couldn’t help but curse. Then, his figure wavered, and he fell headfirst from midair.

The compass had drained all of his True Yuan. He was no longer able to fight. He had hoped his strongest strike could trouble Yang Kai, or even wound him.

But killing Yang Kai? Yang Kang never entertained the idea. Not only was Yang Kai highly skilled, but also, no matter the outcome, they were still brothers.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai could even wield that bone shield. Yang Kang found that hard to accept, his emotions complicated.

Xiao Shun glanced at Yang Kai. When Yang Kai nodded to him, Xiao Shun immediately rushed out and caught Yang Kang, who was falling upside down, placing him gently on the ground. He chuckled, “Fifth Young Master, you have bested me.”

“You’re full of yourself, aren’t you?” Yang Kang sneered, scowling darkly. “It wasn’t you who defeated me.”

His face was filthy, hair wild with anger. He had been shocked by the electric dragons earlier and was injured; compounded by dashed hopes, his sour mood was understandable.

Xiao Shun suppressed a smile and nodded, “Fifth Young Master, please do not get angry. You better return to Zhongdu to recuperate.”

“None of your damn business!” Yang Kang’s mood was evidently foul. Xiao Shun ignored him and quickly walked away.

The duel between the two Yang Family disciples was decided within a single move, and the martial artists below gradually quieted, ceasing resistance.

After all, with Yang Kang effectively captured, he was out of the succession war. Continuing resistance was meaningless.

On the other side, Gao Rangfeng stared incredulously at Huo Xingchen and shook his head with a bitter smile. “Young Master Huo, that’s enough. Fifth Young Master is already out; we needn’t continue fighting.”

“No victor declared yet. Why rush? They are who they are; we are who we are. Come on, continue!” Huo Xingchen smiled lecherously, full of enthusiasm.

Gao Rangfeng sighed helplessly, “I admit Young Master Huo is more skilled. I’m no match.”

He was speechless. He could never have imagined such a frivolous, irresponsible prodigal son had surpassed him in cultivation.

Impossible! When did Huo Xingchen become this formidable?

“If you’d said that earlier, we’d have saved a lot of trouble,” Huo Xingchen laughed loudly. Hearing Gao Rangfeng’s surrender, his mood soared. “Brother Gao, we can fight, but our friendship remains, right?”

“Yes, yes.” Gao Rangfeng disliked Huo Xingchen and felt ashamed to be associated with him. Outwardly agreeing, his mind thought otherwise; they had no friendship at all.

“I’ll take you to a brothel sometime!” Huo Xingchen spoke provocatively.

Gao Rangfeng’s face darkened. He had no words.

“We’re all men; you know how it is.” The eldest Young Master Huo’s brow twitched with a lecherous gleam.
