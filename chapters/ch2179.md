## Chapter 2179 — Not a Robbery

Countless circular sword marks swept down to envelop where Yang Kai stood, the sharp sword aura producing a piercing, clear slicing sound that was chilling to the ear.

Cheng Tai’s expression changed slightly…

Only now did he realize that the two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect hadn’t used their full strength when fighting him earlier. If they had unleashed such a secret technique before, he truly would have struggled to defend against it.

Even now, though this strike wasn’t aimed at him, Cheng Tai still felt deeply uneasy, as if his very will was about to be shattered within those countless sword marks.

He widened his eyes, wanting to see how Yang Kai would defend against this killing move.

After all, this was someone who possessed an Imperial Treasure, surely of high birth and profound learning. Such a strike was terrifying, but to take his life would not be so easy… so Cheng Tai thought, quite naturally.

Yet what he saw before him was completely beyond his expectations.

When the overwhelming sword marks descended, Yang Kai just stood there like a fool, not reacting for a long time. Only at the last moment, when danger was imminent, did he finally make a defensive gesture.

But it was already too late…

Sss sss sss sss…

A strange sound rang out as Yang Kai was completely enveloped by the countless sword marks, sliced into innumerable pieces.

“What?” Cheng Tai cried out in shock, staring ahead in disbelief. “He… died just like that?”

The man he had so deeply feared was so easily killed in a single blow. The scene before him was hard for Cheng Tai to accept!

But soon, he felt relieved…

He secretly thought that Yang Kai’s earlier display of strength was probably just the power of the Imperial Treasure. His own strength was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Thinking this way, everything made sense.

“Overestimating yourself!” Senior Brother also sneered, flicking his longsword with a flourish. In the next instant, his eyes shone with excitement, gaze fixed on the Myriad Sword in Yang Kai’s hand.

Just then, the corpse of Yang Kai, which had been sliced into countless pieces, suddenly twisted and transformed, vanishing directly into midair.

Senior Brother’s face froze as he blurted out, “A remnant image!”

Only now did he suddenly understand the strange feeling that had been lingering in his heart. It was hard to describe, but something had felt off, though he couldn’t say what.

The scene before him explained the source of that strangeness—the thing that was cut apart was clearly not a real body of flesh and blood, but a remnant image.

“Senior Brother, be careful!” the young married woman’s face suddenly changed, and she cried out in alarm.

At the same time, a flash of light swept past Senior Brother’s neck and shot behind him.

Senior Brother’s face changed drastically. He tried to turn his head, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t move it at all. Not only that… he felt a faint pain at his neck, and with a little more force, his entire head suddenly fell from his neck, his vision completely inverted.

“I… died?” A ridiculous thought flashed through Senior Brother’s mind. Darkness swallowed him completely. The last thing reflected in his eyes was Yang Kai, holding the Myriad Sword, standing quietly not far behind him, a drop of bright red blood sliding down the broad blade and dripping to the ground.

“Ah… pfft…” Senior Brother’s death seemed to trigger some kind of chain reaction. The young married woman, whose body and mind were connected to him, suddenly turned pale and spat out a mouthful of blood. Her aura instantly withered, and her beauty aged by countless years in a split second.

She seemed unable to control her body, flailing helplessly as she plummeted, unable to steady herself in midair.

In no time, she crashed among the rocks below, her body shattered to pieces!

“Backlash?” Yang Kai frowned, deep in thought.

This Peerless Spirit Rhinoceros Technique was indeed powerful, but it seemed to have significant drawbacks… He had only killed Senior Brother, yet hadn’t expected it would also cause the woman’s death!

Suddenly, two streaks of light shot out from the corpses of Senior Brother and the woman, aiming for the sky.

Yang Kai reacted quickly, his figure flickering as he grabbed both streaks of light in his hands.

A slight heat tingled the back of his hand. When Yang Kai looked down, he saw that two Star Seals had appeared there!

These two Star Seals had originally belonged to the two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, but after their deaths, the Star Seals became ownerless and could be easily taken.

Neither Star Seal was of particularly high grade. Yang Kai glanced at them—one was a Triangular Star Seal, the other was a Diamond-shaped Star Seal, just like the one he had obtained before!

With this, he now had three Star Seals from the Four Seasons Land!

Star Seals were actually very hard to come by. He had spent over twenty days in this secret realm, and aside from one he got by chance, he hadn’t found any more. Their rarity was clear.

Yet now, he had obtained two more.

While he was examining the Star Seals, Cheng Tai, who had been watching events unfold, was already chilled to the bone!

The situation before his eyes had changed so abruptly that Cheng Tai hadn’t even seen what Yang Kai did—one moment, the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect’s Senior Brother was standing there, and the next, he was beheaded with a single sword strike. In that instant, Cheng Tai realized just how gravely he had underestimated Yang Kai’s abilities!

Although this guy’s cultivation was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, his true combat power absolutely couldn’t be judged by his realm! He was the kind of elite who made fighting above one’s level seem routine!

Thinking this, Cheng Tai no longer wanted to linger. He regretted not leaving earlier, and now, he wasn’t sure if Yang Kai would make things difficult for him if he tried to go.

But staying wasn’t an option either. Cheng Tai could only brace himself, cup his fists, and say, “I offended you before, friend. Please forgive me! I’ll take my leave now…”

“Wait!” Yang Kai suddenly glanced at him coldly and called out.

“Fellow friend... is there something else you require?” Cheng Tai’s face twitched, fear gripping his heart. He wished for nothing more than to flee this place as quickly as possible, yet dared not make a rash move.

“Hold on a moment!” Yang Kai had no intention of killing him. Instead, he flew down to the two corpses from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, took their Spatial Rings, and swept his Divine Sense through them, as if searching for something.

Even so, Cheng Tai obediently stood still. He knew full well that in his current state, he was no match for Yang Kai. If he angered him, he’d end up just like those two corpses!

“There’s nothing useful at all!” After searching the two Spatial Rings, Yang Kai muttered in dissatisfaction.

Actually, that wasn’t quite true.

The two fellow disciples were at least Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm martial artists. Their Spatial Rings naturally contained plenty of good things—Source Crystals, Pills, Secret Treasures—all quite valuable. But none of it was what Yang Kai wanted at the moment.

Saying this, he walked up to Cheng Tai, paused for a moment, and said, “If it’s convenient, Brother Cheng, could you let me see your Spatial Ring?”

Hearing this, Cheng Tai’s face turned ashen, but with no choice, he forced a smile and said, “Of course, no problem.”

As he spoke, he reluctantly took off his Spatial Ring and tossed it to Yang Kai, then hurriedly said, “If there’s nothing else, I’ll take my leave. Sorry for disturbing you…”

“What’s the rush?” Yang Kai glanced at him. “Don’t you want your Spatial Ring back?”

“Huh?” Cheng Tai looked bewildered, not understanding what Yang Kai meant.

“Did you think I was going to rob you?” Yang Kai curled his lip. “Do you think I’d do something so despicable?”

Cheng Tai’s expression shifted through a wonderful array of emotions. He really didn’t know what to say.

“Haha… found something useful.” At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly laughed, moved his Divine Sense, and took something from Cheng Tai’s Spatial Ring.

Cheng Tai looked over and saw that it was a pitch-black Spiritual Herb.

To be honest, Cheng Tai wasn’t sure what this Spiritual Herb was or what it was used for. He just thought it was of high grade and great value, so he picked it. It had come from the Autumn Domain of Four Seasons Land.

He hadn’t expected Yang Kai to take it out now.

Cheng Tai was completely baffled…

He knew exactly what was in his own Spatial Ring. In terms of value, there were things far more precious than this Spiritual Herb, but this strange kid had taken only the herb and left everything else untouched.

While Cheng Tai was lost in thought, Yang Kai tossed the Spatial Ring back to him, playing with the pitch-black Spiritual Herb in his hand, looking overjoyed.

“Do you want anything else…?” Cheng Tai asked cautiously.

“I told you, I’m not robbing you!” Yang Kai shot him a sidelong glance and barked, “Now get lost!”

“Yes, yes, yes!” Cheng Tai replied as if granted amnesty, clutching his Spatial Ring and fleeing in haste. In the blink of an eye, he had vanished without a trace.

After Cheng Tai disappeared, Yang Kai leisurely landed not far from the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, gazing at the pitch-black Spiritual Herb in his hand and muttering, "With this Ink-Black Flood Herb, I'm now short only three more ingredients for refining the Supreme Mystic Pill… Most of the materials I already possess; it's just these three that will be troublesome. I wonder if anyone else might have them."

Muttering to himself, Yang Kai looked around. At this moment, he actually hoped someone would be drawn by the commotion of the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus’s emergence, so he could gather the remaining ingredients for refining the Spiritual Pill.

If the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus were used as the main ingredient, it could be refined into a heaven-defying Spiritual Pill called the Supreme Mystic Pill, which would possess all the effects of the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus and be even stronger.

A single Supreme Mystic Pill could increase a martial artist’s chance of advancing to the Emperor Realm by one-tenth!

If possible, Yang Kai would rather wait for the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus to mature and then refine it into a pill! That way, not only could it be preserved for a long time, but its precious effects could be fully realized. Still… that was easier said than done, especially since he hadn’t gathered all the ingredients for the refining yet.
