## Chapter 1076 — Divine Sense Intrusion

Zong Ao was right about one thing: this place was no place to linger. Shuiyue Star probably still didn’t know whether Xue Yue lived or died; if word reached them and reinforcements came, it would be hard to explain.

Xue Yue herself had no desire to expose her greatest secret.

He had to hurry to bring her back to consciousness, lift the Soul Chain, and then let the heavens be wide and the seas vast — birds free to fly, fish free to leap.

He rested for half a month straight, and during that time Yang Kai received extremely generous treatment: daily mountain delicacies and seafood, fine wines and feasts, rare spirit fruit served as after-meal tidbits. It took a great effort to recover his lost Qi and blood and to shake off that endless weakness.

He silently swore that unless absolutely forced, he would never refine a Pill Cloud again.

If luck smiled while pill-refining and the Pill itself produced a Pill Cloud naturally, that would be one thing. But forcing a Pill Cloud to appear through sheer effort, as he had done before, consumed far too much energy and simply wasn’t worth it.

The palace in Zong Ao’s valley was already built. Halika had sent out only top-tier experts; a dozen or so of them constructing a palace was nothing.

Yet Zong Ao himself did not return, because the Spiritual Qi in that valley remained thin. It would be some time before it reached the average level of Rainfall Star.

Word had spread that he had refined a Leaving Flame Pill that produced a Pill Cloud, and pillmasters from all over Rainfall Star flocked to pay their respects. They were peers, and Zong Ao couldn’t put on airs; each day he endured the flattery and torment of those people, never at ease.

Every time Yang Kai saw that scene he quietly thanked his past self for making the right decision.

Had the credit for producing the Pill Cloud been pinned on him, there was no way things would have been so harmonious. Those aged men and matrons would have made life miserable for him, inspecting his methods and means until everything fell apart.

They would never admit that their ability was inferior to Yang Kai’s; for them that would be an insult.

In the room, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the bed and lifted the unconscious Xue Yue to sit opposite him.

Staring at that alluring, ravishing face, Yang Kai found he was rather reluctant to rouse her.

The sleeping Xue Yue was the easiest to deal with; she was obedient to his manipulation, offered no resistance nor complaint. Once she woke, she would only bring endless trouble and danger.

Yet Yang Kai had no choice but to awaken her; undoing a Soul Chain required the consent of both parties. Now Xue Yue’s Spirit Body was nowhere to be found — without her response Yang Kai could not lift that binding.

His Divine Sense burst forth and silently slipped into Xue Yue’s Sea of Consciousness.

In the next instant, Yang Kai’s Spirit Body manifested above that Sea of Consciousness.

It wasn’t his first time entering Xue Yue’s Sea of Consciousness. He had come once before to check her injuries, though at that time he had not pried deeply.

Peering into another’s Sea of Consciousness is a cardinal taboo for martial artists; it’s something only the closest of intimates would do. A Sea of Consciousness contains a person’s entire life and secrets; to examine it is worse than stripping someone naked. It is the utmost humiliation.

The last time Yang Kai had restrained himself and refused to dig too deeply into Xue Yue’s secrets because he didn’t want excessive entanglement with the woman.

But this time, no matter how unwilling, he had to do it.

A sea breeze blew. The surface was calm; Xue Yue’s Sea of Consciousness contained only a vast ocean and nothing else, unlike his own Sea of Consciousness, which was brilliant and variegated — resplendent and ornate.

This woman’s life must have been very dull; a person’s Sea of Consciousness reflects their inner state. From the condition of a Sea of Consciousness one can see a person’s character.

Although born a woman, Xue Yue had been raised by Ai Ou as a man, forced always to assume the bearing and airs of Xue Yue the Young Master. She might have long since hated such a life, yet been compelled to persist.

“I don’t want to pry into your secrets, but I can’t wake you without doing so. Don’t make trouble for me later,” Yang Kai murmured, and his Spirit Body dived into Xue Yue’s Sea of Consciousness.

Warm seawater enveloped him, like countless boneless hands stroking his whole body, delivering sensations of unimaginable stimulation and comfort.

Yang Kai nearly lost himself for an instant.

The mingling of spirits is terrifying; in that process both parties can experience pleasures far more intense than physical union — tremors from the depths of the soul. That pleasure is like the most dangerous quicksand: once ensnared, it is hard to extricate oneself.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had done this before. When he went to the Ice Sect to find Su Yan, he had experienced a spiritual merging with her and had some experience in handling it.

He struggled to steady the trembling of his spirit and resist the pulls from his heart’s depths, repeatedly urging his mind back to his original purpose: this was no time to indulge.

Gradually the delight receded; he regained control of his Spirit Body and felt a measure of relief.

For some reason, the whole situation made Yang Kai think of the word ‘rape.’

Xue Yue’s Spirit Body was nowhere to be found and clearly felt nothing, unable to resist Yang Kai’s Divine Sense intrusion. If this wasn’t rape, what was it? And it was of the most vicious kind!

Merging with a woman who had no feeling was no different from merging with a log. At that thought, Yang Kai’s interest evaporated and the stir in his chest instantly calmed.

This sort of thing was a solitary performance and terribly boring; only twisted, perverse minds would indulge in it.

Yang Kai spread his Spirit Body out, scattering it across the broad ocean.

Within the Sea of Consciousness, bubbles floated in the water; each bubble sealed a fragment of Xue Yue’s past — a piece of her memories.

Yang Kai carefully probed the information hidden within those bubbles.

He saw countless scenes…

A newborn wailed at birth. The exhausted mother lay pale and bloodless on the bed; hearing the baby’s cry she blossomed into the most beautiful smile. A burly man waiting outside strode in, trembling as he cradled the infant, ignoring the filth on the child and pressing his face close to kiss the baby’s brow, revealing the glory of a father’s love.

Seven or eight older children were cradled in their mother’s arms as she breastfed them, sucking with closed eyes and obvious relish. The mother wore a smile of contentment and would now and then tease her daughter, while the burly father stood to one side, grinning and showing a row of white teeth.

An elderly man with white beard examined the baby carefully, then spoke gravely to the burly father. The laughter and joy vanished from his face. He looked upon the child he treated as his heart’s apple with a face dark as the eve of a storm.

When she was three, the child was taken to a palace, forced into male clothing, and raised as a man. She stood bewildered in the vast palace, trailed by servants and maids, ordered to stay within the compound, clinging to doorframes, never to see the loving mother again — only the stern father.

She began to learn a variety of skills and cultivation. She grew strong, but could only live as a man.

Her talent was exceptional; only when her strength increased would she glimpse a faint smile from her father. At other times he offered only severity and scolding.

The name ‘Xue Yue the Third Young Master’ spread; the entire Star Domain came to know her.

She learned how to greet strangers with the most flawless smile and mastered the most graceful etiquette. Her beauty overturned men and women alike, young and old.

Yet she could not see her mother. Only late at night, in silence, would she take out sets of women’s clothes and lay them on the bed, sorrow filling her heart.

Those feminine garments had been secretly sent by her mother, and they seemed to still retain traces of her mother’s warmth and scent.

Watching scene after scene, Yang Kai immersed himself and seemed to feel Xue Yue’s bitterness and indignation, perceiving the woman’s helplessness and sorrow.

Beneath that unchanging, dazzling smile lay a bitter heart; a fragile soul hidden beneath a strong exterior.

Years of pretense had deceived not only the world but had even deceived herself.

Until that desperate battle on the Dead Star — at that time, though enraged and full of murderous intent, she experienced for the first time the shyness of a daughter. Naked and held by another, her full chest pressed and squeezed, no one knew how fast her heart pounded or how hot her little body burned. That unprecedented sensation spread through her, making her light-headed and weak; every recollection flushed her face scarlet.

The chaotic, flirtatious days that followed became the most unforgettable period of her life — she wished time to halt and to remain forever on that Dead Star.

For only in front of that man could she let go and be herself.

Yang Kai injected her life with vitality; she was no longer deadened.

While exploring the ancient ruins, she ignored the deaths and injuries of her subordinates and constantly ordered faster progress, eager to leave and return sooner.

But an exploding Spatial Ring plunged her into an enduring sleep.

After a very long time, Yang Kai’s Spirit Body finally slipped out of Xue Yue’s Sea of Consciousness.

All of Xue Yue’s secrets were laid bare before him. He had never suspected this venomous woman would have such a tragic past. Though he felt some pity and sorrow, what needed to be done still had to be done.

What he saw was not only Xue Yue’s misery but also the darkness in her humanity.

No matter how pitiable she seemed, she remained a dangerous person.

Her feelings for him were not pure; they had been affected by the Soul Chain.

After so long of watching, Yang Kai had a vague understanding of why Xue Yue’s Spirit Body was missing, and he also conceived a way to begin treating her.

It was a knot tied in her heart, not an injury. Once Xue Yue’s knot was unraveled, she would naturally awaken.
