## Chapter 1031 — Star Emperor Token

The Star Emperor Token contained the divine power of the Star Domain's great emperor; once unleashed, it could annihilate experts of the Void King Realm.

Yang Kai was stunned and unable to speak.

"In my day, someone once used the Star Emperor Token to annihilate an expert of the Void King Realm."

"It can really annihilate experts of the Void King Realm?"

"That is the rumor. I have not seen it with my own eyes, so I cannot tell you its exact power—perhaps it's been exaggerated—but it certainly isn't weak. After so many years, there are probably not many of the ten Star Emperor Tokens left. Keep it carefully; if you ever face an unavoidable calamity, you may use it. But remember, the Star Emperor Token can only be used once!" the Ghost Ancestor warned.

Yang Kai suddenly felt the token burn hot in his hand and hesitated as he looked at the Ghost Ancestor. "Senior, if this token is so precious, why are you giving it to me?"

The Ghost Ancestor grinned. "I have no sons or daughters, no attachments. My strength has reached a level where no one can threaten me—what use is it? If you do not want it, throw it away; I’m sure those people over there would be happy to take it."

He pointed at Shen Tu and the others peering this way from a hundred zhang away.

Yang Kai decisively placed the Star Emperor Token into the Demon God's Secret Codex and hid it in the most concealed corner.

Seeing his action, the Ghost Ancestor nodded with satisfaction. "That’s good. Well then, shall I take you all away from here?"

"No need. I can find the way out," Yang Kai declined politely.

The Ghost Ancestor said no more, smiling broadly. "Very well, live well. I'm leaving."

Saying that, he did not linger; his figure condensed into a black cloud and rapidly departed.

Yang Kai stood for a while with a strange expression, watching the direction the Ghost Ancestor had gone. He shook his head, smiled, and then turned toward Shen Tu and the others.

The group stood quietly. Shen Tu and Yue Xi still felt some lingering fear after the Ghost Ancestor had singled them out and demonstrated his strange methods; both shivered at the recollection.

"Brother Yang… has he left?" Shen Tu asked nervously.

"Yes. He's left," Yang Kai nodded.

"He really just left?" Shen Tu was astonished. The Ghost Ancestor had suddenly approached Yang Kai earlier; they had all thought Yang Kai would be doomed, yet after a short conversation between him and the Ghost Ancestor, the latter had simply gone on his way.

It was completely unexpected.

"He really left," Yang Kai repeated. "You needn't be so nervous. Actually, he's not bad—just a bit ill-tempered."

Hearing Yang Kai, everyone breathed deeply as their bodies and minds relaxed.

"That's how experts are…" Yue Xi said wryly. "They won't look twice at people like us."

"Brother Yang, what did he say to you? You two seemed to be getting along well," Shen Tu asked curiously.

"Nothing much—just thanked me and scolded me a bit…" Yang Kai shrugged and made up a casual reply. He believed the others knew nothing of the conversation or deeds he had exchanged with the Ghost Ancestor.

He would never tell anyone that the Star Emperor Token had come into his possession.

The value of that token was too great; if word leaked out, it would cause unnecessary trouble.

After looking around, Yang Kai said, "Let’s go. We should leave this place."

The others looked at him bitterly but did not move.

"How can we get out? This is not just anywhere—this is the Chaos Abyss… Our cartographers from the Sword Alliance and Purple Star aren’t here," Yue Xi said with a bitter smile.

Bi Ya checked her Star Shuttle underfoot and shook her head. "My Star Chart has been disturbed by the chaotic domain field here; without the Star Chart's guidance, we can’t find the way out."

The brief joy of freedom was immediately replaced by despair; their faces turned grimmer by the moment.

"The Ghost Ancestor just pointed out the direction to me—follow me," Yang Kai said calmly.

A flurry of delighted gazes turned toward him.

Shen Tu exclaimed incredulously, "Brother Yang, you mean the Ghost Ancestor not only didn't kill you and kept his promise, but also kindly gave us the direction?"

"Yes," Yang Kai nodded.

"No way—how did he suddenly get so nice?" Shen Tu still found it hard to believe. "Doesn't make sense."

"It is what it is. Let's go!" Yang Kai summoned his Star Shuttle. Shen Tu climbed aboard without ceremony, wearing a mischievous grin. "Brother Yang, I'm counting on you—I have no secret treasures left on me."

"No problem."

The six of them aboard four Star Shuttles chased one another through the Chaos Abyss like lightning.

Yang Kai led the way while sinking his mind into his Sea of Consciousness to probe the vast Star Chart that hovered above his spirit sea to confirm their position.

He quickly realized how precious that Star Chart was.

With that chart, he could easily see his coordinates and thus precisely determine the direction to leave the Chaos Abyss, free from the interference of the local domain fields.

Yang Kai did not know exactly what odd encounter the Purple Star cartographer Wusuo had experienced to acquire it, only that now it belonged to him.

He felt a faint gratitude toward Wusuo; were it not for Wusuo dying near him, he would not have obtained such a Star Chart that revealed the movements of stars and the myriad dangers within the Star Domain.

With such a Star Chart, Yang Kai could travel anywhere he wished.

Time passed. Among the six, aside from Shen Tu's constant grumbling and chatter, the others maintained silence. Bi Ya occasionally chatted with Shen Tu, but after noticing his incessant prattle, she began to ignore him.

After those trials, the other five had come to regard Yang Kai as their beacon of hope and trusted him without question; they accepted any directive he gave.

Following Yang Kai, they sped through the Chaos Abyss for two months.

One day, a scene they had never encountered before suddenly appeared ahead.

It was a dense Meteorite Sea. Countless meteors of all sizes scattered in the starry sky, hurled along by some inexplicable force; the meteor field stretched into an endless line, seemingly capable of enclosing the entire Star Domain.

Seeing the Meteorite Sea, everyone visibly brightened.

"We’re leaving!" Shen Tu shouted. "Ha ha, finally getting out of here."

"How do you know?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"The outskirts of the Chaos Abyss are covered by such a meteor zone—everyone knows that," Shen Tu answered.

Yang Kai glanced at the others; all nodded.

"I must be ignorant," Yang Kai muttered, pinching his nose.

Shen Tu laughed heartily and patted Yang Kai's shoulder. "You come from a small place… it's normal not to know. You’ll learn in time. Damn, I’ll never go back to the Chaos Abyss in this life. So many disasters."

"You’re the young master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild. How did Lü Guichen and his people capture you? Where were your guards?" Yue Xi asked suddenly.

"Young master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild?" Bi Ya covered her lips and gasped, her beautiful eyes flashing as she looked at Shen Tu.

Shen Tu glanced at Yue Xi and chuckled. "When did you figure out my identity?"

"I didn't. Just guessed. When you were on the Floating Continent you told Yang Kai to send a message to the Hengluo Commerce Guild, and your appearance… looks like a noble I saw years ago—Ai Ou. That lord's name was Ai Ou!" Yue Xi said.

"Ao? Chairman Ai Ou of the Hengluo Commerce Guild?" Bi Ya exclaimed repeatedly, her gaze toward Shen Tu changing.

Even He Zao and He Miao trembled in their seats, surprised that Shen Tu might have such a background.

Yang Kai listened quietly and suddenly realized Shen Tu's origins might be significant.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild, from what he learned from Shen Tu, was a major Star Domain power not inferior to Purple Star or the Sword Alliance, but unlike those two it focused on commerce; the guild's enterprises and trade permeated the Star Domain and it had dealings with every other force.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild occupied several cultivation stars richest in resources; it could supply many scarce cultivation materials to other powers.

"You’re Chairman Ai Ou's son?" Bi Ya asked in astonishment. "Why have I never heard of you before?"

"A bastard, not publicly acknowledged," Shen Tu chuckled. "It's natural you haven't heard of me."

Yue Xi coughed awkwardly and said, "There are rumors that Chairman Ai Ou is a philanderer who sired many scandals…"

Bi Ya smiled wryly. "With your background, why didn't you just tell Lord Lü? He would have treated you with courtesy rather than tossing you into a ship's power chamber."

Mentioning Lü Guichen made Shen Tu grind his teeth. "I told him and he didn't believe me. If Brother Yang hadn't helped, I’d probably have died on your Purple Star's ship."

Faces darkened as they considered that Lü Guichen's disbelief might not be entirely unreasonable.

Chairman Ai Ou was a public figure with several sons whose names weren't secret; suddenly some unknown youth claiming to be the chairman’s illegitimate son would be hard to believe. Anyone would think he was fabricating lies.

"You're unlucky," Yang Kai said sympathetically.

"Don't I know it?" Shen Tu said angrily. "If I'd died, what a grievance that would have been!"

He Miao couldn't help but giggle at his aggrieved look.

As they spoke, their figures raced through the boundless Meteorite Sea, and after a few days the six finally burst out of it.

The scenery changed dramatically. The stars were studded about—there were ancient sun stars radiating tremendous heat, cold moon stars, many cultivation stars brimming with vitality, and more death stars where nothing grew, not even Spiritual Qi. The desolation was boundless.

"We made it!" Shen Tu shouted.
