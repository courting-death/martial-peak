## Chapter 1548 — Enlightenment

In the teahouse, seven people sat around a table, the air between them solemn and still.

Qian Tong and the others were visibly excited, their expressions unable to settle for a long while.

The tidings they had heard from the waiter stirred an inexplicable exhilaration within them.

They had originally been content simply to escape the constraints of the Dark Star's heavenly-law; who could have guessed that upon arriving at this Cuiwei Star they would encounter such fortune.

For those who had spent their lives struggling on the Dark Star, desperately seeking a higher Martial Dao, nothing could sound sweeter than this news.

Without need for further discussion, they all saw the flicker of intent in one another's eyes.

They clearly intended to take part!

"No need to rush," Yang Kai said with a sweep of his gaze. "If what the waiter said is true, the Blood Prison Trial will not begin for some time yet. If you intend to participate, you can stay here, investigate, and then act when certain."

"Indeed. That waiter is just an ordinary person; even if the Blood Prison Trial is a once-in-a-thousand-years matter, he likely knows little. This should be carefully probed and confirmed," Yang Xiuzhu nodded gently, agreeing with Yang Kai's view.

"Very well, then we'll stay. There's plenty of time, and if this place truly offers such opportunity, there's no need to leave for now," Qian Tong proposed.

"No objection," Mo Yu replied with a nod.

Having settled the matter, they hurriedly found a fine inn in Lushui City and rented several side rooms to house themselves.

Yang Kai did not remain; after entrusting Qian Yue to Qian Tong and the others' care, he boarded his Star Shuttle alone and left Lushui City.

He needed to search this Cuiwei Star for traces of Su Yan.

Given the mental link between him and Su Yan, if she truly had been stranded on this cultivation star, locating her would not be difficult—once the two approached within a certain range, some response would naturally be felt.

Moreover, Su Yan's Ice Soul Pearl was still in Yang Kai's possession; that thing would also produce a reaction in her.

Yang Kai moved like the wind, standing upon the Star Shuttle, full of expectation as he began to traverse Cuiwei Star.

Crossing over towering mountains, racing across rivers and seas, great swathes of land were left behind by Yang Kai.

As time passed, he grew steadily more disappointed.

Cuiwei Star was the nearest cultivation star to where Qian Yue and Su Yan had been separated back then; it was highly likely she might have ended up here.

Even the next nearest cultivation stars lay at least months' travel away from here.

Yang Kai felt Su Yan should not have gone farther afield.

Yet after his search, there was not the slightest trace of Su Yan, and the Ice Soul Pearl gave no reaction—this result surprised him.

Su Yan was not here.

Six months. Yang Kai had nearly traversed the entirety of Cuiwei Star in that time, never once stopping, but the ultimate outcome left him disheartened.

On top of a high peak, Yang Kai stood at the summit, gazing into the distance with a forlorn expression.

Having failed to find Su Yan, his spirits were low.

In the forest, a pair of eyes brimming with savagery watched him, approaching silently under the cover of the trees.

This was the domain of a powerful demonic beast; no living being might set foot there without the owner's permission.

Any creature that dared to violate this rule had already been devoured by the demonic beast.

The beast possessed its own instinct; it stared at Yang Kai, sensing that this man's strength was not very great, and prepared to unleash a slaughter to teach him the consequence of trespassing.

Using the wind to mask its scent, it drew near step by step, searching for the right angle and moment to strike.

Quietly, it watched as Yang Kai turned his head and cast a glance toward its hiding place.

"Bad luck for you," Yang Kai murmured, baring his teeth in a sinister grin that chilled the approaching beast to the bone; a deep unease suddenly spread from the depths of its heart.

Before it could act, Yang Kai waved his hand and his three major aids sprang into action.

The little Stone Puppet hefted the Heaven-Shaking Pillar and suddenly transformed into a stone giant; the Artifact Spirit cried out, taking the form of a flaming Fire Bird; the Dragon Bone sword released tremendous pressure, accompanied by a high dragon cry, as a giant dragon over ten zhang long and jade-green in hue appeared, swaying its head and tail.

Terror, almost human in expression, showed in the beast's eyes as it turned and fled at top speed.

In that moment it knew it had chosen the wrong target.

"Finish it!" Yang Kai snarled.

The earth trembled as the Stone Puppet strode forward in pursuit, each step leaving deep prints upon the ground.

The Fire Bird became a streak of red light, rushing toward the demonic beast and scorching every tree it passed into ash.

The jade-green giant dragon followed closely behind.

Yang Kai exhaled softly, as if releasing some inner depression, then followed at an unhurried pace.

He was in a foul mood; the beast's presumption in coveting him was practically courting death.

He needed an outlet.

Ahead came the beast's enraged howls and the Stone Puppet's rumbling roars, interspersed with the Fire Bird's cries and the Dragon Bone sword's dragon-song.

Spiritual Qi swirled tumultuously as the forest became the scene of a massacre, many assailing one.

Though the beast's rank was not low—it was at the peak of the Ninth-Tier, merely one step from breaking through to the Tenth-Tier—how could it contend with the combined might of Stone Puppet, Fire Bird, and the Dragon Bone sword?

Even escape was impossible.

There was no suspense in the battle at all; by the time Yang Kai arrived, the beast that had coveted him already lay on the ground, its breath gone.

Its waist was broken, white bone shards protruding; obviously crushed by the Stone Puppet's Heaven-Shaking Pillar, its fur scorched black from the Artifact Spirit's burning.

The jade-green giant dragon circled over its corpse, as if seeking to devour its flesh and blood essence.

Yang Kai stopped it, hurried to the carcass, and calmly shot a golden thread of blood into the body.

Under the control of Yang Kai's Divine Sense, the Golden Blood Threads moved like a living fish, swimming and weaving within the corpse.

A strange sight followed: the corpse visibly shriveled as if something were devouring the energy contained within its body.

Yang Kai watched with a composed expression, as if he had expected this.

Before long, the corpse had been reduced to a dry husk, even its Inner Core vanished.

Yang Kai raised his hand and a thread of gold-and-red flew from the corpse, flickering about his fingers like a living thing.

Gazing at it in silence, surprise and delight flickered across his face, relieving some of his earlier gloom.

With a thought, the Golden Blood Threads in his hand twisted and writhed, then formed into the likeness of a demonic beast.

It was indistinguishable from the beast that had died upon the ground, even matching its size; only this one, fashioned from Golden Blood Threads, shone gold and red and watched with eyes that seemed remarkably intelligent.

The transformation of the Golden Blood Threads!

This mystery was recorded in the lower section of the Demon Blood Threads secret technique; Yang Kai had long deciphered it, though he had never had opportunity to cultivate it.

The changes of the Golden Blood Threads were not limited to fusing and converging different quantities of threads to form varied killing moves.

They could also allow the Golden Blood Threads to devour a demonic beast's flesh and Spirit Essence, endowing the threads with new transformations.

This was the rebirth of the Golden Blood Threads—a crystallization of the wisdom of the elder who pioneered this secret art.

Back when the Imperial Garden party had clashed with the Demon Blood Sect's alluring Sect Master, Yang Kai had seen with his own eyes her two Demon Blood Threads transform into two blood serpents; at the time he had been curious how she accomplished it.

Later, after comprehending the lower part of the Demon Blood Threads technique, he understood the principle.

The Golden Blood Threads were condensed from Yang Kai's Golden Blood; they could devour and assimilate a demonic beast's flesh and essence, drain the Inner Core's energy, and thus produce these so called Blood Beasts.

The two blood serpents of the Demon Blood Sect's leader had likewise been Blood Beasts formed from her Demon Blood Threads!

Blood Beasts could inherit a demonic beast's abilities from life, and because they were formed from Yang Kai's Golden Blood, they were linked to his mind and obeyed at will.

Back on the Dark Star, Yang Kai had never had time to seek suitable demonic beasts, so he had not cultivated the blood beast art.

Now, having stumbled upon a suitable one here, he naturally would not let it slip away.

With the Stone Puppet's aid, the capture had been easy.

Sending out his Divine Sense to sense this blood beast, Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction.

Judging by its aura alone, this blood beast formed from the Golden Blood Threads should be no weaker than a warrior at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; perhaps slightly different from its former life, but not by much.

Most crucially, Yang Kai possessed more than one Golden Blood Thread!

With sufficient demonic beasts, all his Golden Blood Threads could be turned into Blood Beasts; when a hundred of them were released together, even facing the Void King Realm might not preclude him from standing a chance.

Finding suitable demonic beasts would not be easy, though, so this had to be done slowly.

Thinking this, Yang Kai reached out and touched the blood beast.

It immediately shrank until, in the blink of an eye, it was no larger than a pigeon egg, then leapt into Yang Kai's palm.

Yang Kai smiled gently, about to stow it away when something seemed to occur to him; he fixed his gaze on the intelligent little blood beast, his expression turning contemplative.

He fell into deep thought, as if pondering and feeling out some principle.

After a long moment his body trembled and a gleam burst from his eyes as he murmured, "A pill must possess spirit to be called a Spiritual Pill...so that's it!"

In that instant he understood the meaning hidden in the lines that had always puzzled him in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

Though only a conjecture, it was worth trying; if successful, he could craft a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill and ascend to the rank of Void King-Grade alchemist!

"Spread out; guard the vicinity for me and let nothing disturb me," Yang Kai instructed.

The three major aids immediately dispersed, standing guard nearby.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged and, with a wave, retrieved the Purple Void Cauldron and several boxes of medicinal materials from his Spatial Ring.

He struck a few threads of Saint Yuan into the Purple Void Cauldron, then casually opened a jade box, took out a Void King-Grade herb, and tossed it into the cauldron.

The Divine Sense Fire erupted with a roar as Yang Kai began to regulate the tempering of the medicinal liquid.

He moved with practiced ease.
