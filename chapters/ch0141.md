## Chapter 141 — The Opportunity of the Twin Flowers

Yang Kai had been guarding this place for three whole days before Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er finally showed some reaction.

Suddenly, two points of golden light shot out from the empty stone wall, disappearing above their heads. At the same time, the Yuan Qi within both of them surged violently, creating a resonance that echoed throughout the cave.

Yang Kai's expression turned serious as he looked at them. He saw the two sisters radiating a brilliant light, their Yuan Qi seemingly merging together. It first circled around Hu Jiao’er on the left, then flowed over to Hu Mei’er on the right.

Gradually, the fluctuations of their Yuan Qi became identical.

As the energy calmed down, it eventually returned to tranquility.

Both sisters let out a long breath, simultaneously opening their eyes and exchanging a glance, their beautiful eyes filled with uncontainable excitement and joy.

"Congratulations to both of you," Yang Kai's voice of congratulations rang out. After observing them for a few days, he had discerned some clues; these two sisters had fortuitously obtained a legacy from this place for some unknown reason.

However, this legacy was not from the Earth Demon.

According to the Earth Demon, countless experts had perished here during that battle years ago, so the inheritance within this Celestial Cave should not be limited to just one. Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er had simply been fortunate enough to acquire one of them.

Hearing Yang Kai's congratulations, the sisters turned their heads in unison, almost in perfect harmony, and said, "Thank you!"

After saying that, they exchanged another glance and suddenly broke into smiles.

Yang Kai was taken aback, not because of their beauty, but because he could not distinguish who was Hu Mei’er and who was Hu Jiao’er at that moment. They seemed to have truly become one, with no discernible differences.

"Now do you know who I am?" the beauty on the left asked with a smile, her eyes sparkling with pride and mischief.

"Jiao’er," Yang Kai replied with a light chuckle.

The beauty wrinkled her nose in dissatisfaction and said, "You guessed that, didn’t you?"

"Mei’er wouldn’t ask me such a question," Yang Kai explained.

Hu Jiao’er shot him a glance, "I didn’t expect you to know my little sister so well."

Hu Mei’er blushed at this and glanced at Yang Kai, only to find his expression unchanged, which relieved her of any embarrassment.

"Regardless, thank you this time," Hu Jiao’er smiled sweetly.

When Yang Kai had been guarding them, they had been completely absorbed in their fortuitous encounter, with no ability to resist. If Yang Kai had harbored any ill intentions, neither sister would have been able to escape.

Yet, throughout the entire time, Yang Kai had merely stood at the entrance, not moving an inch. They had comprehended for three days, while he had stood there for three days.

Perhaps because of this, Hu Jiao’er found Yang Kai much more agreeable and her tone softened compared to before.

This brat isn’t so detestable after all, Hu Jiao’er thought.

"No need for thanks; let’s leave this place first," Yang Kai said, eager to exit after being delayed by the two for so long.

"Mm," the two nodded, following Yang Kai out.

As they passed through a patch of strange flowers and herbs, the sisters naturally gathered a large amount.

Since it had already been stated that these items were compensation for them, Yang Kai had no intention of claiming any. One Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng was enough for him.

Yang Kai had already inquired about the effects of this heavenly spiritual item from the Earth Demon, and it was immensely beneficial for him.

It contained both Yin and Yang energies, suitable for medicine, alchemy, or consumption.

However, its greatest effect was to enhance one’s cultivation speed. But there was a prerequisite: one must find another woman who practiced a Yin-cold attribute cultivation technique and form a bond with her to share the effects of the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng.

When both he and this woman shared a mutual affection, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng would automatically transform into two streams of energy, dispersing within their bodies.

With the effects of the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, they would become one in spirit and body. During their cultivation together, both their speeds would increase.

This condition was somewhat harsh; how difficult it was to find such a woman in the world!

For this reason, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng was merely classified as a Mystery-Grade Upper-Level spiritual item. Yet for those who met the conditions, its value was immeasurable.

The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng only grew in places where both Yin and Yang energies coexisted. It had an innate affinity for both energies, and with Yang Kai possessing the True Yang Technique, it was understandable that it would settle comfortably in his chest.

During these three days, Yang Kai had also sent a drop of Yang Liquid to it. After absorbing the Yang Liquid, the ginseng displayed an expression of enjoyment, becoming increasingly reluctant to leave Yang Kai.

After a moment, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er finished gathering the herbs. They seemed to have discussed something and unexpectedly took out half to share with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai refused, saying, "I took your things; you don’t need to share with me. We’re all gaining something, so there’s no need for that."

Hu Jiao’er stared at him for a while before breaking into a smile, "Silly boy, don’t be so polite. Besides, these aren’t yours; they’re what we worked hard to gather."

Yang Kai chuckled, "Then how about you two tell me what’s happening outside now?"

Having stayed here for over ten days, he was naturally curious about the outside world.

"Don’t call us ‘misses’; it sounds strange," Hu Jiao’er frowned. "Just call us Jiao’er and Mei’er. If you feel awkward, you can call me Sister Jiao’er."

"Then I’ll just call you by your names," Yang Kai nodded.

"Let’s talk while we walk," Hu Jiao’er chided him with a glance.

As the two sisters chattered away, Yang Kai gradually learned about the events that had transpired outside over the past ten days.

Although the thousands of disciples from the three sects had different landing points, as time passed, they had slowly gathered at the central location.

Many had gained benefits here, but many had also perished.

Over these days, the disciples of the three sects had formed three forces, led by the strong from their respective sects, surrounding and hunting down some powerful demon beasts nearby.

There were a total of nine demon beasts, each reaching the sixth rank. However, due to being sealed for too long, they had just awakened, so their true strength was not very high. The disciples of the three sects could pay some price to kill them and obtain the treasures guarded by these beasts.

The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng that Yang Kai obtained was one of the treasures guarded by a demon beast, but it had a spirit of its own. Sensing danger, it fled early, leading the sisters to chase it here and encounter Yang Kai, thus obtaining their own fortuitous chance.

"When we left, eight of the nine demon beasts had already been killed, leaving only one in the central position. That one is stronger, probably at the peak of the sixth rank, and no one dares to target it for now," Hu Jiao’er said with a smile. "For the treasures guarded by these demon beasts, the disciples of the three sects have gone mad."

Hu Mei’er nodded vigorously, "Yes, yes! You have no idea how fierce those people are when they’re fighting over things."

Their conversation was quite entertaining, with each sister seamlessly picking up from the other, creating the impression of a single person speaking, reminiscent of a duet.

Before long, the three of them exited the cave.

Just as they stepped out, a furious roar echoed from afar, a beastly growl that sounded like a war drum, shaking the earth.

The expressions of all three changed.

Hu Jiao’er said, "Which side has the guts to provoke it?"

According to what she had just said, this last remaining demon beast was at the peak of the sixth rank, equivalent to the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. Even if it had been sealed for countless years and was currently weakened, it was not something the disciples of the three sects could withstand.

During the time the disciples had spent killing the other eight demon beasts, they had suffered heavy losses. If they were to face such a demon beast, they would be slaughtered!

"Let’s go take a look," Yang Kai’s gaze flickered as he dashed forward.

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er quickly followed suit.

Before long, the sisters had caught up to Yang Kai.

Turning his head to glance at them, Yang Kai was astonished. He noticed that their breathing rhythms while running were completely synchronized, and there was some mysterious essence in their steps that allowed the weaker Hu Jiao’er to keep pace with her sister without showing any signs of exhaustion.

What kind of fortuitous encounter had they obtained in the cave to achieve such an effect?

Yang Kai stared for a moment longer, and the beauty on the left blushed slightly, saying, "Why are you staring at us?"

"Uh… are you Jiao’er or Mei’er?" Yang Kai truly couldn’t tell them apart now.

The beauty giggled, her eyes sparkling, "I’m Mei’er."

The other beauty quickly interjected, "I’m the real Mei’er! Sister, don’t say nonsense!"

"Why are you calling me sister? You’re the sister!" the one on the left exclaimed in a fluster.

"Enough with the nonsense. He really can’t tell us apart," the other one said.

"I’m not being silly; it’s you who’s confusing things!" 

Yang Kai felt a headache coming on, nearly stumbling.

Suddenly, both sisters burst into laughter. This laughter made Yang Kai realize he had been played, leaving him utterly helpless, and he could only remain silent.

"Just a joke; you’re not mad, are you?" he couldn’t tell if it was Hu Jiao’er or Hu Mei’er who asked.

"No," Yang Kai shook his head.

"Then why the long face? Smile a little," she said.

Yang Kai cleared his throat, maintaining a serious expression, ignoring them.

After running for several dozen miles, they finally reached the location from which the beastly roar had emanated. Upon looking, not only was Yang Kai stunned, but even Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er were also left speechless.

Not far ahead, there was an enormous turtle-like demon beast.

It stood over ten zhang tall and was about thirty zhang long, its body resembling a moving hill, trampling the earth with each step, causing the ground to tremble.

Its back was covered with a thick shell, with deep grooves and crisscrossing patterns that seemed to tell the tale of time’s passage. Behind it was a long tail resembling a meteor hammer.

Its speed was not particularly fast, but each step covered over ten zhang. Its massive body charged through the area, and its meteor hammer-like tail swung back and forth, creating powerful gusts of wind.

Roars continuously erupted from its mouth, and in mid-air, over a hundred people were fiercely attacking it, but none could halt its advance. It charged with an unstoppable momentum, and every attack and roar sent shivers down the spines of all who faced it.
