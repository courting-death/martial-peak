## Chapter 1642 — Ran Yunting's Coercion

Ran Yunting gave a faint nod, her gaze cold as it swept across Qing Ya's face.

Whether it was because of Yang Kai or not, Ran Yunting suddenly found this outer‑island disciple from Tongxuan Continent somewhat annoying; Yang Kai's tactless face flashed through her mind and left her feeling irritable.

"What are you all making such a racket about? Don't you know Su Yan is in seclusion?" Ran Yunting barked.

The two female disciples assigned to guard Su Yan showed a flicker of panic in their eyes; sensing the Great Elder's sour mood, they immediately became meek and compliant.

The woman surnamed Zhou glanced at Qing Ya and said aggrievedly, "Great Elder, this junior sister insists on entering to see Su Yan. We tried to stop her, but she just keeps yammering and refuses to leave!"

"The Great Elder can see for herself — it isn't that we deliberately meant to disturb Su Yan; there are reasons behind it!" another woman protested.

Ran Yunting’s sharp gaze fell upon Qing Ya as she said coldly, “If she refuses to retreat, don’t you know how to beat her back? Have all these years of cultivation been for nothing?”

At this, Qing Ya and the other two froze, expressions blank.

No one had expected the Great Elder to say something like that.

Inside Ice Heart Valley, between senior and junior sisters there was rivalry and friction, but no one would ever resort to physical beating.

The idea that the Great Elder would order them to strike Qing Ya left the woman surnamed Zhou momentarily bewildered; she stood there stunned.

"What are you standing there gaping for? Are your ears deaf?" Ran Yunting barked again.

The woman surnamed Zhou shivered and finally came to her senses, realizing the Great Elder was not joking. The reprimand left an angry heat in her chest with nowhere to vent; she retorted coquettishly, "Yes — I will obey the Great Elder's orders!"

As she spoke, Saint Yuan energy circulated and she thrust a palm toward Qing Ya.

"Great Elder…" Qing Ya cried out, but before she finished the words a fierce force struck her chest and she was sent hurtling uncontrollably through the air, spitting blood and staining her pure gown red.

Rumbling……

Qing Ya was flung fully ten‑odd zhang. She slammed into an ice wall and finally fell to the ground in a sorry state.

Her face was deathly pale and bloodless; forcing herself to crawl to her feet, she could not catch her breath for a long while.

She was currently at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. The woman surnamed Zhou who struck her was at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. The vast gap in cultivation meant she could not possibly resist that blow.

In a single palm strike, Qing Ya had already been wounded.

Her beautiful eyes trembled violently as she stared at Ran Yunting in disbelief, still reeling and not understanding why the Great Elder would suddenly give such a heartless order.

"Get out! If you ever set foot on the inner island again, I will expel you from Ice Heart Valley!" Ran Yunting showed no mercy as she scolded coldly.

"Qing Ya!" The door to Su Yan's room flew open and she looked frantic, her slender form swaying as she tried to rush to Qing Ya's side.

Although she had heard Qing Ya's argument with the woman surnamed Zhou just now, Su Yan had not dared show herself because of Ran Yunting's orders and had kept the door shut.

But now that Qing Ya had been struck and injured, she could no longer hold back!

The two had both come from Tongxuan Continent and had entered Ice Heart Valley to cultivate together; they were as close as sisters — how could she stand by and watch Qing Ya be beaten?

Yet no sooner had she shown herself than Ran Yunting swept her hand and a strong gust slammed into Su Yan, pushing her back.

"If you dare step out one step, I'll kill her right now!" Ran Yunting stood outside the ice chamber, watching Su Yan's grief‑stricken face with a ruthless expression.

Panic flickered across Su Yan's features; she looked at Ran Yunting as though at a stranger, opened her mouth, then finally did not act rashly. After a long breath she grit her teeth and said, "I beg my master to show mercy for Qing Ya's first offense and not punish her further!"

Ran Yunting nodded. "If you behave, I won't make things hard for her."

Su Yan bit her lip, clenched her small fists, and whispered, "This disciple will obey Master."

Only then did Ran Yunting show a trace of satisfaction. “Good—that’s how it should be! I came here this time to tell you that man has already arrived on Icebound Island. Will you sever your own emotions to mend the flaw in your heart, or shall I take matters into my own hands?”

Su Yan trembled, staring at Ran Yunting in terror and pleading with her eyes, whispering, "Master…"

To sever her own emotions would be to cut off everything between her and Yang Kai, leaving them as strangers from that moment on.

If her master intervened, the only result would be Yang Kai's death.

Neither choice was acceptable to Su Yan — both were worse than death.

"There is no third option! I'll give you a few days to think it over. Answer me when you are sure!"

Su Yan's beautiful eyes immediately went dim, as if a cloud had passed overhead and the light ahead was lost; she stood frozen.

By the time she came back to her senses, Ran Yunting was already gone, and Qing Ya had vanished as well. Only the two Senior Sisters at the door remained, casting her gloating smiles.

Those smiles felt unbearably sharp to her.

For the first time in more than thirty years, she felt the thought of shattering the shackles that bound her and fleeing this place rise in her mind.

Undeniably, Ran Yunting had been extremely good to Su Yan. Since bringing her to Ice Heart Valley she had devoted herself to instructing Su Yan and the valley's resources had been used to give her the best possible cultivation conditions.

But while pouring herself into guiding Su Yan without reserve, Ran Yunting had also put shackles on her.

Her expectations for Su Yan were too great; she heaped unbearable burdens on Su Yan, forcefully pouring the hopes she could not fulfill herself into the girl.

Ran Yunting had spoken to Su Yan time and again about Ice Heart Valley's future and the mysteries of the Void King Realm.

Su Yan had not minded before; when her master gave instructions she simply obeyed. After all, without Ran Yunting she and Qing Ya and Qian Hao might still be struggling on Cuiwei Star and could hardly lead such a carefree life.

But now Su Yan felt exhausted.

Yang Kai's appearance gave her someone to rely on; she did not want the future of Ice Heart Valley — she only wanted to walk beside Yang Kai and roam the world together.

She had never possessed such great ambition or desire—her wishes had always been simple.

Outside the door, the two senior sisters made no effort to hide their barbed mockery, trading quips and clearly in high spirits.

Su Yan felt a chill in her heart. She said nothing further, sat cross‑legged in silence, and waved her hand to close the ice chamber door.

……

At the outer island pavilion, Yang Kai found the Ice Heart Valley disciple who looked after his daily needs.

This disciple was likewise from the outer island and was only at the First Stage of the Saint Realm; she looked about twenty‑four or twenty‑five years old and, while not dazzlingly beautiful, was rather pretty in a clean, fresh way.

Disciples of Icebound Island cultivated ice techniques, so there was a faint chill about her.

"Miss, do you know Qing Ya?" Yang Kai asked as he looked at her.

"Senior Sister Qing Ya? I know her!" the woman nodded, smiling faintly. "Our grottoes aren't far apart, so we often meet. Senior Brother, do you also know Senior Sister Qing Ya?"

"Yes. Could you take me to see her?"

"You want to see Senior Sister Qing Ya?" The woman's brow furrowed and she hesitated. "I don't think that's possible."

"Why not?"

"The elders ordered that Senior Brother may only rest here and must not go wandering without permission. You know, all disciples in Ice Heart Valley are women and no man has ever set foot inside. If you stroll around and see something you shouldn't…"

As she spoke, the woman's face reddened.

"I see… then never mind." Yang Kai laughed it off without pressing the matter, chatted with her briefly, and then returned to the pavilion.

Relieved that Yang Kai did not force the issue, the woman could not help but breathe easier, thinking him reasonable.

Back at the pavilion, Yang Kai's face was calm, betraying no emotion, but a sense of unease nagged at him.

Was he being placed under house arrest?

Moreover, it had been three days since Valley Lord Bing Long and Great Elder Ran Yunting had visited, and during those three days no one had come to see him — not even Qing Ya had shown herself.

This puzzled Yang Kai.

If others neglected him it might be excusable, but why would Qing Ya not come? She knew why he had come to Ice Heart Valley, yet he found himself confined to the outer island pavilion, unable to take a single step away, let alone visit Su Yan.

In these three days Su Yan had not once communicated with him in spirit.

The more Yang Kai thought about it, the more uneasy he felt. He discreetly released his Divine Sense and learned that the woman remained stationed outside the pavilion guarding him.

Spatial Force rippled at Yang Kai's side and in the next moment he vanished like a ghost from where he stood.

For others it would be hard to slip away, but for Yang Kai, who had cultivated Spatial Force, it was effortless.

Before the woman guarding him noticed, he had already materialized at a concealed spot three li away.

Looking up at an ice peak some ten li away, Yang Kai's figure flickered as he moved closer.

Earlier, while chatting idly, Yang Kai had casually probed the woman's grotto location and learned its exact position.

Since she had said her grotto wasn't far from Qing Ya's, Qing Ya's grotto should also be on that same ice peak.

It was just a matter of finding the precise spot.

Before long Yang Kai arrived at the foot of the ice peak. Concealing his aura, he looked upward.

The ice peak was carved with several hundred grottoes, all appearing inhabited, which gave Yang Kai a headache.

Extending his Divine Sense to investigate, he found that every cave dwelling was protected by its own barrier. Though with the strength of Yang Kai’s Divine Sense he could easily break through the restrictions of these outer island disciples, doing so would only bring unnecessary trouble.

So he frowned and watched quietly, waiting.

Just as he was at a loss, a team of about four or five Ice Heart Valley disciples approached the foot of the ice peak.

The leader among them was at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; the others were at the Saint King Realm.

Though their cultivation levels were not high, Yang Kai sensed a faint, pervasive violent aura about each of the women, a discovery that made him frown.
