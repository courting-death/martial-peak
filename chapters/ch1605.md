## Chapter 1605 — Yao Hill

“I know, I won’t act recklessly.” Yang Kai grinned. “Let’s part ways here then. Once things are settled, we’ll meet again in Lushui City. I’ll take my leave first.”

Yang Kai bowed slightly, and after speaking he turned and became a streak of light, soon vanishing from the sight of Qian Tong and the others.

"Let's go as well," Qian Tong called, "so many people died this time; the competition in the Blood Prison will probably lessen quite a bit. It's a good time to seek opportunity — we mustn't miss it."

"Brother Qian is right!" Tianze's eyes brightened; the gloom he had worn earlier vanished, replaced by excitement and anticipation.

A hundred li away from Domain Stone Mountain, in a desolate and uninhabited place, Yang Kai glanced around. After confirming there was no one nearby, he suddenly grinned and said, “Come out.”

The next instant, the ground before him gave a series of rustling noises, and then a small head poked out; two lively, mung-bean-sized eyes spun about, the little figure sprang up and hopped to Yang Kai's feet.

The Stone Puppet was very small.

Yang Kai had slipped the Stone Puppet out while locked in battle with Zhang Qing and the others; everyone had been stunned by his overwhelming presence and never noticed the puppet's movements.

Everything had happened without anyone knowing.

"How were the gains?" Yang Kai asked, looking down at the Stone Puppet.

The Stone Puppet barely reacted; it opened its mouth and spat out a fist-sized Domain Stone.

Yang Kai reached out and plucked the Domain Stone from the air into his palm, sensing it for a moment, then chuckled and patted the little puppet's head, praising, "Well done!"

He could picture it: the Stone Puppet's belly must be stuffed full of Domain Stones, a quantity so vast it would move any cultivator of the Void King Realm.

One could say the destruction of Domain Stone Mountain was entirely because of it.

It had slipped in stealthily from below and, without leaving a trace or alerting anyone, hollowed out the entire Domain Stone Mountain. That was why cultivators felt the mountain's effect weakening, and why the mountain suddenly shattered and was hollow inside.

All of this was thanks to the Stone Puppet!

Domain Stone Mountain was indeed hard as stone, but the Stone Puppet was born exceptional: it naturally devoured all manner of minerals. It had even gnawed a hole in the Ancestral Treasure of the Liuli Sect, the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain, so Domain Stone Mountain naturally stood no chance.

The moment he first saw Domain Stone Mountain, Yang Kai had entertained a crooked thought.

He had not expected that ordering the Stone Puppet to act in that way would cause Domain Stone Mountain's destruction and trigger that terrifying domain field.

The instant he sensed something wrong, he roared aloud to warn others.

Unfortunately, most cultivators were blinded by the immediate gains and ignored his warning; only a few retreated with him in time to save their lives.

He then instructed the Stone Puppet to disgorge everything in its belly. Yang Kai led it to a more secluded spot and had it spit out all the Domain Stones it had swallowed.

After a count, Yang Kai could barely contain his joy.

A full two to three thousand Domain Stones!

It was an utterly terrifying number; from when Yang Kai had entered the Blood Prison until now he had only obtained three Domain Stones, and others' hauls were not necessarily better and might even be worse.

Yet now he had acquired two to three thousand at once!

Perhaps, since ancient times, no cultivator who walked out of the Blood Prison had ever taken so many Domain Stones.

It seemed he would never again need to worry over comprehending Domain; with so many Domain Stones in hand, Yang Kai could unabashedly absorb their miraculous energy, glean Domain insights, and probe the essence of the Void King Realm.

His future would surely be bright and smooth!

His spirits soared.

Those who entered the Blood Prison primarily sought to temper their own Shi with the Domain whirlpools; a secondary purpose was naturally to hunt for Domain Stones.

Yang Kai felt he had achieved both purposes.

Leaving the Domain Stones aside, their sheer quantity was enough; the Domain whirlpools now could not stop his exploration. His understanding and application of Shi had reached a new height; even if not perfected, he was not far from completion.

Perhaps one day, when he advanced to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, his Shi field would be perfected and he would possess the capital to break through the Void King Realm!

Yang Kai did not intend to waste any time. He prepared to search for the Void Mind Crystal left behind by the Yao King who had died here tens of thousands of years ago, fulfilling the task Chi Yue had assigned him.

On Di Chen Star there were ten great lords, but none deserved the title Yao King.

To become a Yao King, one needed top-tier cultivation at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Since ancient times, Yao Kings born on Di Chen Star were rare.

There had been one tens of thousands of years ago, unfortunately drawn into the strife of Cuiwei Star and ultimately dying within the Blood Prison.

Chi Yue had told Yang Kai the exact location; after all these years Di Chen Star had quietly sent many yao elites to the Blood Prison Trial, and they had already scouted intelligence, though none had ultimately succeeded.

Yang Kai pressed on without delay.

Perhaps because of the Domain Stone Mountain incident and the many deaths, he felt the number of cultivators in the Blood Prison had indeed dropped a great deal. After several days' travel he could detect no signs of life; the surroundings were empty with not a soul in sight.

Ahead sat a bare little hill, no more than a hundred zhang high; nothing grew upon it, only rubble and earth.

Yet that small hill exuded an exceedingly strange aura that stopped one in their tracks.

Yao qi! And a very powerful kind of yao qi.

Even a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would not dare set foot lightly on that hill, for the pervasive yao qi was not something they could withstand. If one lingered too long, it would surely invade the body.

It was the yao qi of a Yao King-level expert; those at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could not dissolve it and would only be corroded, their meridians and flesh eaten away, becoming yao, or suffer Qi Deviation and die.

Thus in the Blood Prison that strange little hill had long been treated as forbidden ground; no one dared enter at will, and even passersby skirted far around it to avoid being affected by its yao qi.

"This must be the place!" Yang Kai murmured as he looked at the bare hill; the hill matched the information Chi Yue had given — the site where that Yao King had fallen.

After a moment's inspection, Yang Kai strode forward and headed straight for the little hill.

Soon he reached its base and stepped in; the pervasive yao qi attacked him like a cat scenting fish, surging from all directions into his pores and pouring into his meridians.

Yang Kai rallied his Saint Yuan to resist the yao qi's intrusion.

It was taxing — fitting for the Yao King-level yao qi left behind by such a being; even after tens of thousands of years it was not easily resisted.

Thankfully Yang Kai carried the primordial power of the Golden Sacred Dragon, so although yao qi forced its way in the effect on him was not severe; other human cultivators at the Origin Returning Realm would likely have to withdraw immediately.

Having ensured he was not in any great danger, Yang Kai advanced step by step upward.

He soon reached the summit and cast his gaze about; the surroundings were empty, nothing to be seen, which made his brow crease.

Chi Yue had only said the Void Mind Crystal lay within this barren hill, but she was not certain of its exact location.

If not on the summit, then it might be elsewhere. Yang Kai silently probed and after a moment had a plan, picking a direction and heading that way.

After the burn of an incense stick, Yang Kai arrived at the hill's rear and stood before a pitch-black cave, peering inside with focused intent.

The cave was pitch-black and gave nothing away; when his Divine Sense probed in it was bounced back.

If his guess was right, that Yao King-level expert had fallen within this cave, for the yao qi here was thickest.

He felt no fear, withdrew a nightlight stone from his Spatial Ring, clasped it in his hand, and stepped inside.

The deeper he went the stronger the yao qi became; the innermost part seemed to be the source of the yao qi.

After a while Yang Kai finally reached the deepest chamber of the cave.

The cave seemed man-made with a narrow entrance and wider interior; the innermost chamber was a rock grotto spanning dozens of zhang in diameter.

In one area of the grotto something massive lay across the ground, from which a startling yao qi spread out.

Yang Kai took out more nightlight stones and flicked them with a curved finger, shooting them into the crevices of the surrounding stone walls.

In a blink the entire dim grotto brightened.

Looking again toward the front, Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and his face showed shock.

He discovered that the massive object lying across the front was nothing other than a skeleton!

A huge Demonic Beast skeleton!

It measured about twenty zhang in length; its form somewhat resembled an ancient giant crocodile. Even as a skeleton it exuded astonishing might.

This skeleton should be the true body of that Yao King-level expert; it seemed he had been a transformation of a Demonic Beast, otherwise his true body would not be revealed in death.

Those yao born human in form remain human-shaped in death, though they may have practiced secret arts to awaken Demonic Beast bloodlines within and unleash their potential in battle.

For one to take on a beastly form upon death, he must have been a manifestation of a powerful Demonic Beast.

This was the most authentic yao, with an extremely pure bloodline!

Moreover, it was the skeleton of a Demonic Beast at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm! Even after tens of thousands of years, its bones remained vivid and each bone looked unusually solid — material of the highest order for forging artifacts.

Yang Kai's eyes burned with desire.

Chi Yue had only instructed him to hand the Void Mind Crystal over to Yu Xiong; she had not said anything about giving up this Yao King's bones, so he could certainly keep them for himself.

Lingxiao Sect was developing now, and the sect had highly skilled artificers from Star Emperor Mountain; though they could not rival Yang Yan, they were still the best on Dark Star. If Yang Kai took these bones back for them to work, he believed they could forge a large number of Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasures!
