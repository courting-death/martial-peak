## Chapter 2307 — Purely a Private Matter

The few members of Thousand Leaves Sect, upon hearing Yang Kai say this, looked at him suspiciously, confusion on their faces.

Yang Kai grinned and whispered, "With the City Lord looking so confident, how could he not have made some preparations?"

Du Xian's expression changed slightly, as if he had thought of something. He also whispered back, "Young Master Yang, do you mean he is prepared to..."

Yang Kai shook his head, signaling him to wait and see.

Over there, the bride, adorned in a phoenix coronet and red wedding robes with a red veil atop her head, stepped forward and stood before Chai Hu. Chai Hu looked at her, joy evident in his single eye, and said, "Fifth Sister, stand aside and help me hold the line. I’ll make that old bastard release Eldest Brother and the others, then we’ll escape far away and never return to Tianhe City!"

The bride said nothing, obediently moving to stand beside Chai Hu.

"You’ve caused a huge commotion in my mansion today, disgracing me. Do you think... you can just leave?" Luo Jin sneered, his face mocking as he let out a cold snort.

"Everything depends on their efforts!" Chai Hu replied with a cold laugh.

Luo Jin smiled meaningfully, saying, "I think... it’s better if you stay!"

Chai Hu’s expression changed. Just as he was about to speak, he suddenly felt a chill at his back. The next moment, a palm pressed against his back, and a surging force poured into his body, shaking him violently and sending him flying.

While airborne, he turned his head in disbelief. When he saw who had attacked him, his eyes filled with grief and despair.

Bang...

Chai Hu crashed to the ground, smashing tables and chairs, but quickly got up. However, that palm strike had left him seriously injured, and as soon as he stood, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Swish, swish, swish...

The experts of the City Lord’s mansion rushed over, several palms pressing down on him at once. Power surged in their palms, but they held it back, not releasing it.

After all, today was the City Lord’s concubine-taking ceremony, and it was truly inappropriate for blood to be spilled. If not for that, Chai Hu would likely already be dead.

Restrained, Chai Hu staggered, barely able to stand. He looked at the bride with a face full of pain and despair, blood spilling from his mouth as he cried, "Fifth Sister... why?"

The one who had just ambushed and gravely injured him was, shockingly, the bride he had come to rescue. Even now, he couldn’t believe it was real.

All of this happened in a flash. Not only was Chai Hu stunned, but the surrounding guests were left gaping, dumbfounded. Only Luo Jin seemed unsurprised, smiling faintly as if he had expected it.

Yang Kai suddenly stood up, his gaze burning as he stared at the bride, his expression constantly shifting.

"Yao Qi?" Ye Qinghan frowned, covering her red lips and whispering, "This bride... is actually a member of the Yao Race?"

When the bride struck just now, though it was brief, the power she displayed was completely different from Origin Qi, carrying a pure yao aura.

Some human martial artists do cultivate yao techniques or secret arts, making their power resemble yao energy, but it’s never this pure. Clearly, this bride was not human, but a member of the yao.

The Star Realm is not without yao. It’s just that yao rarely appear in human territories, and even if they do, it’s extremely rare and they go to great lengths to hide their tracks. After all, with different races, it’s inevitable that some people will harbor ill intentions upon seeing yao.

Many, like Ye Qinghan, noticed this as well. For a moment, everyone curiously looked at the bride.

Judging by the power fluctuations when the bride struck, she was clearly a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm martial artist.

"Young Master Yang, what’s wrong?" Du Xian saw Yang Kai’s odd expression and quickly asked.

Yang Kai ignored him, just staring intently at the bride, his body trembling slightly as if he had discovered something shocking.

"Take him away and watch him closely. After the ceremony, I’ll have a good talk with him!" Luo Jin commanded with a wave of his hand.

Several guards from the City Lord’s mansion nodded, sealing Chai Hu’s cultivation and preparing to escort him away.

"No!" Unexpectedly, a delicate cry rang out. Everyone saw Luo Bing, having escaped danger, rush straight toward Chai Hu. She punched and kicked at the guards, pushing them aside, then spread her arms to shield Chai Hu, shaking her head repeatedly, "Don’t come any closer!"

Her stance to protect Chai Hu left the guests stunned again. No one could figure out what she was thinking. After all, everyone had seen Chai Hu use her as a hostage earlier. Now that she was free, shouldn’t she be running away from him? Why was she throwing herself back into danger?

"Bing’er, what is this nonsense!" Luo Jin roared in anger. His daughter had truly infuriated him today, defying him again and again, and now she wanted to protect the very person who had ruined his ceremony. How could he not be angry?

"Father, Eldest Brother Chai saved my life yesterday. He’s my lifesaver, please don’t make things difficult for him." Luo Bing pleaded, her voice choked with tears.

Luo Jin’s eyes narrowed, "Lifesaver?"

Luo Bing said, "Yes, yesterday I was in danger, and Eldest Brother Chai saved me..."

"Yesterday?" Luo Jin frowned, his voice cold. "Weren’t you out with Young Master Qiu yesterday? How did this man end up saving you?"

Luo Bing shook her head, "I’ll explain everything to you in detail later. For now, please don’t make things difficult for him. Let him go."

Qiu Yu’s face turned pale when he heard this. He quickly flashed over to Luo Bing, grabbed her arm, and said, "Sister Bing, don’t make trouble. The City Lord already said he wouldn’t hurt him. Just listen and be good."

Luo Bing shook her head, "Then let him go now!"

Impatience flashed in Luo Jin’s eyes as he said to Qiu Yu, "Young Master Qiu, my daughter is being unreasonable. Take her away to rest."

Qiu Yu nodded, "As you command!"

As he spoke, he tapped Luo Bing, and she immediately collapsed, limp but still conscious. Qiu Yu picked her up and started toward the back hall.

After being injured by the bride, Chai Hu seemed to lose his soul, unmoved by everything around him. Only now did he, with his single red eye, grit his teeth and say, "Fifth Sister, tell me, why is this? Are you really willing to marry that old bastard?"

Luo Jin sneered, "I’ve given you enough face. If you don’t know what’s good for you, don’t blame me for being rude!"

A guest called out, "City Lord, there’s no need to be so merciful. This man’s crime is unforgivable!"

"Exactly! The bride and City Lord are a perfect match, a hundred years to cross the same boat, a thousand years to share the same pillow. Heaven made this pair, earth created this couple. How could a despicable man like you break them apart so easily?"

"I don’t believe it, I don’t believe it!" Chai Hu screamed desperately.

"Stubborn fool!" Luo Jin snorted coldly, his voice heavy. "Then watch closely and see if my wife is truly willing to marry me!"

With that, Luo Jin turned and looked around, his face dark as he said, "If any friend here disagrees with this marriage, step forward. I’ll give you a satisfactory answer."

Today, his ceremony had been disrupted and his reputation damaged. He wanted to assert his authority and restore his dignity, his face full of killing intent as he spoke.

Who would dare stand up and oppose him now?

"City Lord, you must be joking. There will always be a few who don’t know what’s good for them. You needn’t bother with them."

"Yes, letting such people ruin the mood is not worth it. Let’s continue!"

Only then did Luo Jin’s face soften a little. He snorted, "Today is supposed to be a joyful occasion. I don’t want to lose my temper. If anyone still disagrees, just speak up."

He looked around, and everyone forced a smile.

"I..." Suddenly, a voice rang out, and the relaxed atmosphere instantly grew tense again. Many people gasped, looking toward the source, thinking there really were people unafraid of death, daring to go against the flow at such a time.

Luo Jin’s face darkened, anger overflowing, his eyes full of killing intent as he looked to the side.

At the frontmost table, a young man stood up with a smile, raised his hand, and said, "I... have a tiny objection. I hope City Lord won’t be angry."

"Someone from Thousand Leaves Sect!"

"A disciple of Thousand Leaves Sect, are they going to kick someone when they’re down at this moment?"

"He looks unfamiliar. Is he really from Thousand Leaves Sect?"

"How could it be fake? Didn’t you see him sitting with Ye Qinghan and Du Xian and the others?"

"Now things are getting interesting."

Whispered discussions broke out. When everyone saw the speaker sitting with Thousand Leaves Sect disciples, they immediately realized today’s events had become even more complicated. Chai Hu was just one person; failing to snatch the bride and getting beaten was just a joke. But if Thousand Leaves Sect got involved, it could mean two forces tearing each other apart and going to war. That would affect tens of thousands of li around here.

At the main hall entrance, Qiu Yu, carrying the incapacitated Luo Bing, was about to leave. Hearing this, he suddenly stopped and looked back. When he saw who had spoken, his face changed, "Why is that brat here? He’s completely lawless!"

"Young Master Yang..." Ye Qinghan was dumbfounded, staring blankly at Yang Kai, her hand covering her red lips, not knowing why Yang Kai was stirring up trouble.

"Young Master Yang, what are you doing?" Du Xian’s expression also changed, instantly realizing the seriousness of the situation. Although they knew Yang Kai wasn’t a Thousand Leaves Sect disciple, outsiders didn’t. Since they were all sitting at the same table, others would naturally assume Yang Kai was acting on behalf of Thousand Leaves Sect. If he opposed the marriage now, it would look like Thousand Leaves Sect was making trouble.

If that misunderstanding arose, they might never be able to leave Tianhe City.

In an instant, cold sweat broke out on Du Xian’s forehead.

"Private matter! Purely a private matter!" Yang Kai smiled at the two, then looked up at Luo Jin.

Luo Jin was clearly confused as well. After staring at Yang Kai for a while, he asked, "Are you also from Thousand Leaves Sect? I’ve never seen you before."

What puzzled Luo Jin even more was that this group from Thousand Leaves Sect was sitting at the very front table. What was going on?
