## Chapter 936 — Shadow King, Greetings!

In Yao Wang Valley, on Hidden Cloud Peak, a flash of azure light passed, and Yang Kai suddenly appeared.

He didn't soar straight up; instead he deliberately halted at the foot of the peak.

This place was the Sacred Land in the hearts of every alchemist. Master Xiao Fusheng, the world's foremost alchemist, held court here, and anyone who came would never think to fly up the mountain without showing proper respect.

Years ago Yang Kai had stayed in Yao Wang Valley for a time. Though he never learned the Way of pill-refining from Master Xiao, the old man still taught Yang Kai many precious lessons.

On Yang Kai's path of growth, those lessons had proven invaluable on numerous occasions.

Yang Kai respected the kindly master from the bottom of his heart, and he respected the two beautiful women who served the master; they had once offered him their best resources.

He was deeply grateful for their generosity and aid.

On this trip he also intended to bring the three of them to the Tongxuan Continent.

Master Xiao Fusheng's lifelong wish had been to concoct a Spirit-Grade pill, but bound by the limits of this world he had never achieved that goal.

Once on the Tongxuan Continent, with its resources and Master Xiao's technique, refining a Spirit-Grade Pill would not be difficult.

Yang Kai began to walk slowly up Hidden Cloud Peak, looking at the medicinal herbs cultivated in the mountain wilds along the way, remembering the two months he'd once spent here.

He couldn't help but smile.

Yao Wang Valley hadn't changed much from before. Wu Zheng and his gang were causing trouble in Zhongdu and at Lingxiao Pavilion, but it seemed not to have spread here.

Before long he reached the summit.

As always, a few thatched huts—extremely simple.

Two well-filled figures were sweeping leaves and dust in front of the hut, their hair wrapped in scarves to keep the dust from soiling it.

Hearing Yang Kai's footsteps, both women looked up. The one standing in front wiped the sweat from her brow and eyed him with suspicion.

"Aunt Xiang, Aunt Lan!" Yang Kai grinned broadly and called out.

"You..." Aunt Xiang was stunned for a moment, then joy flashed across her eyes. She set down her broom and hurried forward. "Yang Kai?"

"It's me."

Aunt Lan hurried over as well, inclining her head and appraising him up and down before pursing her lips with a smile. "So many years—I'd almost not recognized you."

"Yes, you've filled out a lot since before; you didn't look well back then." Aunt Xiang greeted him warmly. "Come in and sit."

"Mm."

Inside the hut, at the simple table, Yang Kai and Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan sat down; three cups of coarse tea were set out.

Aunt Lan said, “There’s nothing much to offer, so don’t stand on ceremony.”

"You're too polite, Aunt Lan." Yang Kai drained his tea and smiled. "Though it's been years, Aunt Lan and Aunt Xiang haven't changed much—you still look as young as ever."

The two women exchanged a glance and smiled, pressing their lips together.

"Smooth-tongued—always trying to win people over," Aunt Xiang scolded, "You've fooled quite a few young girls, haven't you?"

"Not at all." Yang Kai scratched his head.

"I heard you left Zhongdu more than ten years ago; where did you go, and now you're back?"

"Mm, I've only been back a few days."

"We're just glad you returned safely. The master used to keep talking about you, saying that you, who are so skilled in alchemy, pretended to know nothing—when you first came here you pulled the wool over his eyes."

"Back then... I truly didn't understand. Master—where is he? Is he in secluded refinement underground?" Yang Kai asked.

The expressions on Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan darkened; their smiles faded and solemnity settled on their faces.

Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart as a bad premonition arose.

"Master... he passed away five years ago." Aunt Xiang turned her head, her eyes reddened as she whispered.

Yang Kai froze in place, a sour pain welling in his chest, grief rolling through him like a tidal wave.

Only then did he suddenly recall that Master Xiao had publicly accepted disciples because he had sensed his days were limited, which explained his earlier urgency.

He had never expected the master to have left the world five years before.

"Master..." Yang Kai opened his mouth.

"His wish was fulfilled!" Aunt Xiang fought back her sorrow and produced a jade box from her bosom. "Seven days before he passed, using his last vestige of life force, he refined a Spirit-Grade Pill. This is what he made."

Yang Kai took it; it felt weighty in his hand, as if it carried not just a pill but a life.

Opening it revealed a plump, glossy Spirit-Grade Pill, its Spiritual Qi searingly potent and its medicinal efficacy condensed—such a pill might be beyond even an outstanding Spirit-Grade alchemist to craft.

"The master left peacefully." Aunt Xiang wiped the corner of her eye and forced a smile. "So there's no need to mourn him excessively. But the master said Spirit-Grade is not the ultimate zenith for alchemists—beyond Spirit-Grade there must be even higher tiers."

Yang Kai felt a jolt of awe at Xiao Fusheng's far-sighted vision.

In that instant Yang Kai seemed to comprehend: Master Xiao's urgent desire to refine a Spirit-Grade Pill wasn't merely a personal breakthrough in his alchemy, but an attempt to use a single person's effort to shatter the world's constraints.

He had succeeded.

A Spirit-Grade pill this world had never seen had been refined by him.

"Where was the master buried?" Yang Kai looked up and asked.

Aunt Xiang rose slowly and said, "Come with me."

On Hidden Cloud Peak, in a very remote hollow, a lone earthen mound stood— not far from the summit.

It was hard to believe such a simple grave could be the resting place of the world's foremost alchemist.

"Everything was done according to the master's final wishes. His body isn't here—after cremation his ashes were scattered into the rivers. This mound only holds a few of his personal items."

Aunt Xiang explained as Yang Kai paid his respects.

"That one of his registered disciples could come see him—if the master knew he'd be very happy." Aunt Xiang covered her mouth and by the time she finished she was sobbing; Aunt Lan beside her had reddened, tear-filled eyes as well.

"It's what I should do." Yang Kai nodded softly.

......

Half a day later, atop Hidden Cloud Peak, Yang Kai bade farewell to Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan.

"You two shouldn't be so set on staying. This place may not remain peaceful; the world has now linked with a place called the Tongxuan Continent, and in the future many unimaginable experts may come here," Yang Kai urged.

Earlier he had wanted to bring the two women who had cared for him to Zhongdu, but they had refused his kindness, insisting on staying.

"No need. We've lived here all our lives and don't want to go elsewhere. Besides... the master is here; if we leave he'd be alone, and we'd rather stay to keep him company."

"We're grateful you feel that way," they said.

Yang Kai sighed helplessly.

Seeing their resolve, he knew further persuasion was useless. "Then I'll come back when I can. If anyone dares cause trouble here, use my name—it might help."

"Understood." Aunt Xiang nodded with a smile.

"Take care!" Yang Kai cupped his fist, then turned and descended the mountain.

“Be careful in all things—never act recklessly out of pride.” Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan stood atop the peak, waving their hands.

After leaving Hidden Cloud Peak, Yang Kai placed the jade box with Master Xiao's Spirit-Grade Pill into the Black Book Space, summoned his Flying Shuttle, which became an azure light, and set off west.

His destination was the Cangyun Evil Land.

This time he had left Zhongdu mainly to visit two places: Yao Wang Valley and Cangyun Evil Land.

He planned to see Shan Qingluo.

Though that enchantress was unrestrained and wanton, she still treated Yang Kai quite well. During the battle against the Evil Lord, she had lent considerable aid.

Most importantly, Yang Kai had planted a seed of affection in her heart, forging an indelible bond between them.

Since he had returned, he naturally wanted to take her to the Tongxuan Continent to keep her from being bullied here.

As for what she would do once on the Tongxuan Continent, Yang Kai didn't intend to concern himself.

Within a couple of hours Yang Kai arrived near Piaoxiang City.

This city was the most prosperous and stable in the entire Cangyun Evil Land and was under Shan Qingluo's jurisdiction.

After the Evil Lord's death and the heavy losses suffered by the Six Great Evil Kings, the Cangyun Evil Land descended into chaos, but Piaoxiang City remained untouched because the Enchantress Queen had returned safely.

The prosperity and stability here sharply contrasted with the endless slaughter elsewhere in the Cangyun Evil Land.

Many warriors unwilling to live in constant fear flocked to Piaoxiang City to make a living, making the city ever more populous and prosperous.

Yang Kai walked along, thinking about what attitude he should adopt when he met that enchantress.

She was dangerously seductive; if she really started to act coquettishly toward him, Yang Kai wasn't sure he could handle it—if he lost control, his reputation would be ruined.

Besides, she had a habit of pushing things too far, so he had to be on guard.

In short order he reached the gate of Shan Qingluo's palace in Piaoxiang City.

At the palace gate a ragged man, like a beggar, leaned against the wall with his hands folded and eyes closed, appearing to rest. He looked filthy—hair in disorder and a beard long unkempt—utterly wretched.

No passerby gave him a second glance; such a presence only bred contempt.

Yang Kai gave him a casual glance, a strange smile at his lips, and strolled up, ignoring the foul stench emanating from the man.

The noon sun was blocked by Yang Kai's figure. The beggar squinted, looked up, then casually shut his eyes again to continue resting.

He treated Yang Kai as if he did not exist.

Yang Kai grinned and called out to him, “Shadow King, greetings!”

The beggar's body trembled; he abruptly opened his eyes, which flashed with electric light. Only then did he seem to recognize Yang Kai; his face changed drastically, the gaunt, skin-and-bone figure swayed, and in the surge of power he vanished from sight.
