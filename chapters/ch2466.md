## Chapter 2466 — Discipline

After a short while, Yang Kai's body reformed, but his face turned pale and he couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of blood.

Although he had used the Nothingness secret technique to dissolve Feng Xi's strike, he still suffered some shock.

But Feng Xi was relentless, pressing his advantage. Seizing the instant Yang Kai was distracted, he soared into the air, his figure wrapped in sword light, transforming into a brilliant rainbow as he struck down at Yang Kai with overwhelming momentum.

The power of Imperial Might erupted and spread, forcing Yang Kai to crouch lower under the pressure. He staggered backward, panic appearing on his face.

"How boring! I haven't even warmed up and you're already done for. In your next life, remember to show the respect an expert deserves!"

As he spoke, the sword aura, like a long rainbow, slashed straight down at Yang Kai.

But at that moment, an inexplicable sense of dread suddenly surged up, making the previously confident Feng Xi's expression darken, his mood shifting unpredictably.

When he looked up again, Yang Kai no longer showed any sign of panic. Instead, a hint of mockery and ridicule appeared on his face.

What's going on? This brat is just a Dao Origin Realm cultivator, yet at this life-or-death moment he dares to smile at me so oddly. Could it be he still has a hidden trump card?

As his thoughts raced, Feng Xi gritted his teeth and followed his intuition, tapping his foot and floating backward.

At the very instant he retreated, a massive Moon Blade suddenly slashed out from right in front of his toes. The spatial rift it tore open surged with an extremely unsettling aura.

"Hiss..." Feng Xi sucked in a cold breath, his eyes wide as he stared at the Moon Blade, disbelief written all over his face.

This strike was incredibly mysterious—silent and deadly. He believed that if he hadn't dodged in time, just this one blow would have left him gravely injured.

What kind of power is this? Feng Xi's face darkened. He had thought Yang Kai's strength was only so-so, but after this exchange, he realized he hadn't seen the full extent of Yang Kai's abilities.

"Oh? Young Sect Master, not a bad reaction." Yang Kai also looked at Feng Xi in surprise, speaking with some unexpected admiration.

If this had been more than two years ago, Feng Xi would have died facing such a blow. But now that he had reached the Emperor Realm, he was indeed different from before. Moreover, Yang Kai could feel that this Emperor Realm Feng Xi was even stronger than Qiu Ze, whom he had killed in the past.

As expected of a disciple from a great Sect. The foundation he possessed, the secret techniques he cultivated, were not something Qiu Ze could compare to.

Although Qiu Ze was the Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace, that sect was only mid-tier at best in the Southern Territory. How could it compare to a behemoth like Wenqing Sect? Wenqing Sect had even produced a Great Emperor!

"You were hiding your strength?" Feng Xi glared at Yang Kai, his face full of displeasure and a hint of humiliation.

As an Emperor Realm cultivator, he thought he could easily dispose of Yang Kai with a wave of his hand, but in reality, he had almost been caught off guard by Yang Kai. How could he not be angry? Especially with two Junior Brothers watching from the side, he felt even more embarrassed.

Yang Kai curled his lip and said, "Sect Master, that's an interesting way to put it. You grew stronger in the Shattered Star Sea, but do you expect everyone else to stand still?"

Feng Xi had advanced to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea, his strength soaring. But Yang Kai hadn't been idle either. In just the year and a half it took him to subdue the Mountain and River Bell, his own strength had greatly increased. Both his Origin Qi and Divine Sense had seen significant improvement.

"Very good. No wonder Father always said never to underestimate any opponent, no matter their cultivation. Today, I've learned that lesson, Yang Kai. You've taught me well." Feng Xi snorted coldly. "I originally planned to take your life directly, but since you insist on resisting, don't blame me for tormenting you!"

Yang Kai snorted, "Young Sect Master, do you still think you have me at your mercy?"

"Do you really think I can't kill you?" Feng Xi's eyes widened, as if he'd just heard the biggest joke in the world.

"You can try!" Yang Kai stared at him with a grim face.

"As you wish!" Feng Xi gave a low shout. With a flick of his wrist, he put away his longsword and instantly drew another.

This sword was a deep blue throughout, exuding an extremely cold aura. As soon as it appeared, wisps of white mist rose from its blade, and the surrounding space seemed to freeze.

"Imperial Treasure!" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, his gaze fixed on the blue longsword. He grinned, "Now that's more like it. With your noble status, Young Sect Master, you should always have an Imperial Treasure at your side!"

He had found it odd earlier that Feng Xi didn't have an Imperial Treasure, but now he understood—Feng Xi did have one, he just hadn't used it until now.

Now that he had drawn this Imperial Treasure sword, it was clear he was going all out.

"Laugh while you can. Soon, I'll make you cry!" Feng Xi looked at Yang Kai with disdain. With a shake of his sword, icy cold energy swept out in all directions as he shouted, "Snowy Heaven Sentiment Sword!"

Blossoms of sword flowers suddenly bloomed, transforming into visible killing intent that layered upon itself as it surged toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai suddenly felt a chill run through his entire body, an involuntary shiver coursing down his spine. Channeling the Laws of Space, he summoned forth a surge of spatial power. With a fierce motion, he thrust out his hand and grasped at the air before him, shouting in a low voice, "Condense!"

Weng...

A deep, muffled sound suddenly rang out. The space within a hundred zhang radius around Feng Xi instantly solidified, becoming incomparably viscous.

The supreme sword technique he had unleashed was also frozen in the void at that moment.

Feng Xi's eyes bulged, nearly popping out of their sockets.

"Th-this..."

"What's going on!"

The yellow-faced youth and the scholar watching from not far away were also shocked, completely unable to understand what had happened. All they saw was Yang Kai reach out, and their Sect Master's sword technique was suppressed just like that.

"Break!" Yang Kai shouted again.

Crash...

A series of crisp sounds rang out as the sword flowers Feng Xi had painstakingly formed shattered like broken mirrors, the icy aura vanishing in an instant.

Not only that, but with Feng Xi at the center, countless fine, hair-thin spatial cracks formed, completely surrounding him.

Space became extremely unstable in an instant, as if it could collapse at any moment.

Yang Kai raised his hand, and two massive Moon Blades suddenly appeared in his palms, as if he were holding real objects. Smiling, he looked at Feng Xi and said, "Young Sect Master, your cultivation is a bit lacking!"

"Power of Space!" Even if Feng Xi were a fool, he would know what divine ability Yang Kai had used. His expression turned panicked as he cried out in alarm.

Looking at the countless spatial cracks around him and the two Moon Blades in Yang Kai's hands, his face instantly turned ashen.

Yang Kai's face turned cold. "I've killed more than one Emperor before. If you think that just because you've advanced to the Emperor Realm you can do as you please in front of me, you're gravely mistaken. Since you're wrong, you need to be taught a lesson. Young Sect Master, let me discipline you on behalf of your father. You don't mind, do you?"

Feng Xi was so furious he could spit blood, his whole body trembling with rage. He wanted to curse, but didn't even know where to start.

But Yang Kai had already waved his hand, sending the two massive Moon Blades howling toward him.

Feng Xi was startled, watching as the Moon Blades drew closer. He knew Yang Kai intended to take his life—this was no mere discipline!

In his terror, his expression suddenly grew solemn. With a gentle twist of his Imperial Treasure sword, an indescribable sword intent soared into the sky.

Yang Kai's eyes lit up. He didn't know what trick Feng Xi was about to pull, but judging by his posture, he clearly wasn't willing to sit and wait for death.

No wonder—he had finally advanced to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea, with a bright future ahead. How could he be willing to die here?

A solemn, majestic profound intent spread out. As Feng Xi slowly swung his sword, his entire aura changed dramatically. He seemed like a different person—his gaze was clear, but icy cold, devoid of emotion or desire.

“Sentiment questioned, sentiment severed; the Heavenly Dao, without Dao!” came a low chant.

The sword light suddenly blazed, and as the sword aura soared, a mysterious energy spread out.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, shocked. He hadn't expected Feng Xi to unleash such a strike. This was a move only a true expert could perform, one that resonated with the principles of Heaven itself!

If Feng Xi survived, he would surely achieve great things in the future.

Yang Kai's expression darkened. He swung his fist forward with all his might.

"Banish!"

A pitch-black black hole suddenly formed in front of Feng Xi, exuding a chaotic aura of nothingness that made one's heart tremble.

The sword move he had unleashed was instantly disrupted, revealing flaws.

The two Moon Blades finally struck, and the countless fine spatial cracks, under Yang Kai's control, also attacked Feng Xi.

"Ah!"

A scream rang out, the previously unshakable aura thrown into chaos. Feng Xi's figure was instantly enveloped by the Power of Space, blood spurting everywhere—a truly horrifying sight.

"Young Sect Master!"

The yellow-faced youth and the scholar were terrified, shouting uncontrollably.

They had thought dealing with Yang Kai would be a simple task for Feng Xi, but to their shock, Yang Kai, who was only at the Dao Origin Realm, had completely suppressed their Sect Master. How could such a thing happen?

If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they would never have believed it.

But at this moment, they didn't dare to rush in to help. So, despite their frantic shouts, they just stood in place, their eyes darting about, ready to flee at any moment.

If the Young Sect Master died here, they knew they wouldn't escape Yang Kai's wrath either.

After his strike, Yang Kai didn't stop. Instead, he shook the Myriad Sword, sending a torrent of sword light sweeping toward Feng Xi.

Shrill sword-light tore through the air in rapid succession.

Strange sounds rang out continuously. When all the sword light finally faded, the void returned to calm.

Yang Kai panted slightly, while Feng Xi now lay there, his flesh and blood mangled, looking utterly miserable. It was unclear whether he was dead or alive.

"Gulp..."

The yellow-faced man and the scholar both swallowed hard, their faces deathly pale. They stared blankly at Feng Xi, sweeping him with their Divine Sense, only to find that he was barely breathing, clearly having suffered unimaginable injuries.
