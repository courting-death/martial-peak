## Chapter 780 — Probing

It was the same great hall as before; Xueli sat waiting, but An Ling'er did not appear.

Yu Mo escorted Yang Kai in, reported respectfully, then stood to one side, watching with cold eyes.

Xueli gave a slight nod, raised her eyes to sweep Yang Kai once, and said lightly, "I've kept you all these days—are you ready to create some value for me?"

Yang Kai frowned. "I don't know what you mean."

Xueli chuckled, rose with measured steps and spoke in a soft, coaxing voice, "I told you, Sand City doesn't keep trash. Since I let you live, I won't feed you for nothing. First Stage of the Transcendent Realm—among humans, for your age that's no small achievement. You must be a core disciple of some major force, right?"

Yang Kai gave no clear answer.

"But that doesn't concern me. I don't care which power you come from; once you're in my hands you must obey. You do what I order, and if you dare disobey even a little… you know the consequences."

As she spoke, a cold, cutting gleam flashed across her movement.

"So what do you want me to do now?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

"Kill—or be killed!" Xueli laughed softly and waved a hand. "Yu Mo, explain it to him thoroughly. It's time for him to make an appearance."

She sank back into her chair, reclining lazily and watching Yang Kai at leisure.

Yu Mo stood and announced aloud, "The lands around Sand City are barren; even the territories under Lady Xueli's command are not especially rich—Heaven-and-Earth Energy is scant. Neighboring the Sand Sea, no merchants pass this way; by rights, the domain should be poor."

"Isn't that so?" Yang Kai tilted his head and looked at him.

Yu Mo smiled slightly. "Not at all. On the contrary, Sand City's wealth outstrips any city in the Demon Domain—immense riches flow in and out of here every year."

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, mildly surprised.

Yu Mo regarded Yang Kai with pride. He had expected the youth to ask why, but Yang said nothing, so Yu Mo lost interest and continued, "There is one place in Sand City that draws all manner of figures—this spot is our greatest source of profit. Even the other three Demon Generals station people there."

"Oh? What kind of place attracts so much attention?" Yang Kai's interest was piqued.

"The Death Arena!" Yu Mo grinned. "Simply put, fighters of similar levels are sent in to fight for their lives. The Lords place huge amounts of crystal stones or resources on a chosen combatant; if that person wins, they gain returns based on the odds. Different odds yield different payouts—if fortune smiles, returns can be several to dozens of times the wager."

"That's gambling, isn't it?" Yang Kai remarked.

"It is gambling!" Yu Mo agreed.

"And Sand City runs the house, so you always profit," Yang Kai smiled.

"We must cultivate, and cultivation needs supplies. If the territory is poor, we must find ways to take from the Lords' pockets."

"You want me to fight to the death with someone, right?" Yang Kai asked.

"Exactly. We had a few people, but they were all beaten to death recently, and we lost many crystal stones. You're First Stage—fights with you may not be thrilling, but with proper handling we can still recoup much of our losses," Yu Mo nodded.

"What's in it for me?" Yang Kai asked.

Yu Mo was taken aback to hear him ask.

"Of course I want something—I'm betting my life, am I to receive nothing?" Yang Kai said as if it were only natural.

Yu Mo looked up and asked Xueli, "Lord, what reward for him?"

"Give him some incentive."

Yu Mo bowed, then told Yang Kai, "If you can secure us a win, we'll give you half the proceeds."

Yang Kai pondered briefly, then nodded, "Fine."

He turned to Xueli and asked, "If I can raise enough ransom this way, will you release me?"

Xueli opened her eyes, looked coldly at Yang Kai, then closed them again and said indifferently, "Depends on my mood. If you behave I'll consider it; if you keep bargaining and nitpicking, I'll kill you on the spot. Yu Mo, test his skill—don't just talk."

No sooner had she spoken than a terrifying oppressive pressure suddenly burst from Yu Mo, sweeping over Yang Kai.

Yang Kai crouched low, nearly dropping to his knees, startled by the overwhelming force; his True Yuan surged through his meridians to resist the pressure.

Yu Mo was astonished—he had long disdained Yang Kai and intended to teach him a lesson, to make him kneel and break his arrogance, but unexpectedly the youth held firm.

His expression hardened and he intensified his power.

Yang Kai stifled a groan, his body sinking lower, knees bent, face flushed crimson; he clenched his teeth and glared at Yu Mo as flesh trembled across him.

Crackling sounds rang out.

The white jade floor suddenly shattered, a blast wave roared outward from Yang Kai, the hall's walls cracked with varying lengths, and the structure rocked as if about to collapse.

Xueli finally opened her beautiful eyes and stared intently at Yang Kai, an expression of expectation on her face—she wanted to see whether he could withstand Yu Mo's methods.

Under Yu Mo's terrifying oppression Yang Kai trembled and veins bulged, but after only ten breaths or so he seemed to adapt; the hunched form slowly straightened.

Yu Mo's expression changed; he knew how much force he'd released. Under such power, even a First Stage martial warrior would have no strength to resist, let alone someone of Second Stage—only Third Stage could barely hold out.

Yet the youth had resisted, though with great difficulty.

With a cold snort, Yu Mo strengthened his power for a third time.

Crack—

Yang Kai's feet suddenly sank into the ground up to his knees.

At that instant Yang Kai moved—like an arrow loosed from a bow he sprang up, True Yuan spouting between his hands into a thunderous strike; before he reached Yu Mo a massive golden greatsword had formed in his grasp and came crashing down at him.

Murder glinted in Yu Mo's eyes as his True Yuan slithered like a coiling snake, emitting a dangerously sinister aura.

"Enough!" Xueli's cool command resounded through the hall.

An invisible force halted Yang Kai; the Xuantian Sword in his hands dissolved into light and vanished as he fell heavily to the ground.

Yu Mo abruptly withdrew his power, frowned at the rising Yang Kai and snapped, "Kid, you tried to kill me just now?"

Yang Kai let out a grim, eerie smile.

"True Yang Yuan Qi—what an irritating aura!" Xueli frowned, clearly displeased.

Although her cultivation would not be suppressed by Yang Kai's True Yuan, her Demon Yuan inherently resented and resisted True Yang Yuan Qi as if fire and water.

"Your strength is not bad—I've underestimated you," Xueli nodded slightly. To withstand Yu Mo that long and still dare to counterattack with the intention to slay him, this human youth possessed combat power and will far exceeding his current cultivation.

As a Saint Realm expert, Xueli's discernment was not without basis.

"This can be exploited," Yu Mo said coldly, scanning Yang Kai with a hungry look.

"Yes—it's time to make those bastards bleed," Xueli said with a cold smile. "Schedule his fight for tomorrow. I want him to win only after unimaginable hardship!"

"Understood!" Yu Mo chuckled viciously, eyeing Yang Kai like a wolf eyeing a lamb.

"I have one more request!" Yang Kai shrugged and added before Xueli could take offense, "One final demand!"

"Speak!" Xueli snapped unhappily.

"Give me a Secret Treasure that can change my appearance. I don't want my face seen by too many demons—otherwise I'll be hunted later," Yang Kai said.

Xueli paused, then smiled faintly. "You think ahead."

If Xueli handles this well, Yang Kai could bring her tremendous profits; the enraged losers won't dare act against Xueli and will instead direct their wrath at Yang Kai. Even if he gained his freedom from Xueli, he would likely be unable to leave the Demon Domain.

Yang Kai did possess such a Secret Treasure—Du Wan had given it to him.

But he dared not use it. He had once used the altered face to participate in the contest for the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's elixir; if recognized, the trouble would be greater, so he had to seek Xueli's help.

"I don't have such a precious Secret Treasure on hand—too rare," Xueli shook her head. "But I can provide a mask to partially conceal you."

"Fine!" Yang Kai nodded.

"Take him away. Rest well tonight—don't die tomorrow!" Xueli chuckled.

Yu Mo led Yang Kai back to his previous room and before departing injected several strands of True Yuan into him; instantly Yang Kai felt his True Yuan flow slow and his reactions dull.

"You know why I did this?" Yu Mo asked.

Yang Kai lightly nodded without resistance—judging from Xueli's earlier words, she intended him to stage a near-death spectacle tomorrow to fool those demon bettors and cloud their judgment, so that when he fought later they would underestimate his power and bet on the wrong targets.

Without Yu Mo's means, Yang Kai might expose a flaw; those betting demons are not blind—their eyes are sharp.
