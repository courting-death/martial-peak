## Chapter 1928 — Transformation of Power

Others had clearly noticed the oddity as well, and they all turned to look at Yang Kai and Ai Ou with puzzled expressions.

"I am not using any secret technique, only ordinary circulation to absorb," Ai Ou said with an innocent face, glancing toward Yang Kai as he spoke.

Yang Kai nodded and said, "I am not using any secret technique either."

All of them were overlord-level figures who had come from the Star Domain, and naturally they acted in concert rather than resorting to intrigue, so no one doubted what Ai Ou and Yang Kai said.

"Strange, strange — is there something different about the two of you?" Gu Cangyun frowned and pondered.

Chi Yue's eyes suddenly brightened and she murmured thoughtfully, "Could it be... because you are Star Lords?"

At her words, everyone revealed looks of sudden understanding and considered it quite possible.

Among the six, only Yang Kai and Ai Ou had refined Stellar Origin and were Star Lords; the other four were not. If there was any distinction between the two and the rest, this explanation was the only one that fit.

Thinking it through carefully, this was indeed the only reasonable explanation.

"How curious — the body of a Star Lord holds such mysteries?" Wudao shook his head, a trace of regret on his face; had he known, he would surely have tried to refine a Cultivation Star himself, no matter how dangerous, one must take such chances.

The surrounding starlight had the effect of cleansing the body and soul; that was only what they could perceive, and perhaps there were other benefits yet undiscovered — the more one absorbed, the better.

For now the other four could only gaze at Yang Kai and Ai Ou with boundless envy, watching the starlight stream into their bodies and vanish.

Ai Ou could not help but laugh loudly, his face full of pride.

Yang Kai pondered a moment, then said, "Let's split up. I will take one side alone; you seniors take the other. Keep a distance, but close enough to sense one another."

Wherever he passed, not a trace of starlight remained, and naturally he could not allow others to follow directly behind him.

Fortunately, up to this point nothing dangerous had been found here, so they could safely split into two groups.

"That will do," Wudao nodded in agreement with Yang Kai's suggestion.

The others had no objections, and the six divided into two lines: Yang Kai on the right, the remaining five on the left. The six advanced forward at an unhurried pace.

Although Yang Kai still did not fully understand why being a Star Lord made things so convenient here, the starlight saturating the place clearly had something to do with Stellar Origin; otherwise he and Ai Ou would not appear so different from the others.

It was likely precisely because they carried Stellar Origin within that the starlight drew near and could be absorbed so easily.

After briefly checking the situation on the left and seeing that Ai Ou and the others were all fine, Yang Kai relaxed and focused on sensing the benefits the starlight brought as it entered his body.

His body had always been extraordinarily robust; after being tempered for several years in the Death Domain, it had long surpassed what was typical for the Void King Realm.

Yet with the starlight entering, Yang Kai still felt his physical quality significantly improve; flesh writhed and every piece of muscle seemed to contain earth-shattering power.

Even the pure Golden Blood flowing through him attained a certain degree of purification.

Those pure Golden Blood drops were Yang Kai's unique treasure; he had thought them already as refined as they could be, but only now did he realize his view had been short-sighted.

The pure Golden Blood could indeed be further condensed!

His body was cleansed to utter purity; bones gleamed like jade and even his internal organs shone like porcelain.

This was the sign of a body becoming supremely pure.

His spirit also gained enormous benefits.

Yang Kai manifested his Spirit Body and retreated into his Sea of Consciousness, where specks of starlight spread throughout, both filling and nourishing his Sea of Consciousness to strengthen his spirit, and at the same time drifting toward the treasure isle that the Warm Spirit Lotus had manifested, where it was received.

The Warm Spirit Lotus, having accepted the starlight, unleashed surreal, dreamlike seven-colored radiance that spread outward in ripples.

That radiance contained ineffable profundity; as the ripples passed, Yang Kai's spirit became more solid and stronger.

Seeing this, Yang Kai suddenly understood.

Previously, he and Ai Ou had behaved differently here and absorbed starlight at a rate the others could not match; that could be explained by their identities as Star Lords.

But both being Star Lords, he was absorbing starlight at a speed ten times faster than Ai Ou!

That was hard to explain.

He had been unable to figure it out earlier, but seeing the situation inside his Sea of Consciousness clarified everything.

It was the Warm Spirit Lotus at work! With the Warm Spirit Lotus helping to absorb starlight and integrate with him, how could Ai Ou compare?

At the sight, Yang Kai was struck by a memory of what Wu Shengfeng, a powerful expert from the Star Realm's Falling Star Sect, had once said.

Wu Shengfeng had said the Warm Spirit Lotus, when taken one step further, would reach its ultimate form.

Yang Kai had been greatly surprised then, because he had always thought the seven-colored form was the Warm Spirit Lotus's final state; only from Wu Shengfeng did he learn he'd been mistaken.

How the Warm Spirit Lotus would appear after taking that further step, and how to make it advance, Yang Kai knew nothing of — but seeing it actively absorb starlight now, he understood the starlight here was crucial to its evolution.

He allowed the Warm Spirit Lotus to act and continued forward at a leisurely pace.

Wherever he went, his whole person acted like a magnet, drawing in every nearby starlight; savoring his changes, Yang Kai enjoyed it like sweet nectar.

He simply closed his eyes and strolled with casual ease.

Time flowed slowly; there was no sun, moon, or stars here, and they did not know how long had passed, though at least a month had gone by.

Suddenly, a low exclamation came from Yang Kai's left.

Yang Kai was startled, thinking something had gone wrong over there, and quickly opened his eyes to look.

It did not take long for him to realize he had been mistaken; the five on that side were fine, but Ai Ou wore an expression of shock and furrowed his brow as if in deep thought.

The other four wore similar expressions.

"Sirs, what has happened?" Yang Kai asked.

Ghost Ancestor lifted his head and said, "Sect Master, feel the power within you — see whether it has changed!"

He did not answer Yang Kai directly but urged him to sense for himself; Yang Kai immediately understood this was no trivial matter and earnestly immersed himself in the sensation.

Soon Yang Kai's face showed astonishment and his expression shifted.

"Looks like you noticed it too," Ghost Ancestor chuckled, "we only realized it just now."

"What is happening?" Yang Kai asked the others in stupefaction.

Everyone shook their heads; none could explain.

Wudao pondered for a long while before speaking, "From my observation, the Saint Yuan in our bodies seems to be transforming into a higher form of existence."

"Transforming into a higher form?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Yes." Wudao nodded slightly. "I'll state my view first — whether it is correct I cannot be sure, but I think this is what is happening."

He paused, then continued, "When we martial artists began cultivating, the power within was Yuan Qi. Upon reaching the True Yuan Realm, Yuan Qi transforms into True Yuan; only True Yuan can support the techniques and secret arts wielded by those above the True Yuan Realm — lowly Yuan Qi is insufficient. It's like a child growing bigger and needing larger clothes; clothes too small will only restrict movement."

Everyone nodded slightly.

What Wudao spoke was common sense; after traveling the path of cultivation together, who did not understand such truths?

"And when a martial artist reaches the Saint Realm, their True Yuan becomes Saint Yuan," Wudao's eyes flashed with light, "yet after entering the Saint Realm through Saint King, Origin Returning, and Void King, the Saint Yuan showed no sign of further transformation. I have long pondered what form the power above Saint Yuan might take, but could not find an answer; today I may have found it."

At that, Wudao's eyes shone fiercely and he appeared greatly exhilarated.

"You mean..." Yang Kai's heart stirred, "the Saint Yuan within us is about to transform into a higher existence?"

"It should be so," Wudao laughed heartily. "And the starlight here is not merely cleansing the body and spirit; it also aids the transformation of our internal power! I estimate that if all the power within is fully transformed, one could take that next step!"

At those words, everyone's bodies trembled.

Among the experts here, aside from Yang Kai, they were all at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and they naturally understood what Wudao meant by taking that step.

Beyond the Void King Realm!

That was a boundary countless experts in the Star Domain had chased for years without reaching.

And now the change in their internal power represented an opportunity, a sliver of light.

This was certainly a brand-new power they had never encountered, far purer and far more condensed than Saint Yuan.

In other words, given the same cultivation and the same techniques, if two Void King Realm experts fought — one using Saint Yuan and the other this new power — the latter would win without question.

True Yuan was stronger than Yuan Qi; Saint Yuan stronger than True Yuan; this newly appearing force was naturally many times stronger than Saint Yuan.

"It's just that we don't know what to call this power," Wudao said with regret; after all, they had never encountered a higher layer of the Martial Dao.

"But I feel this power is closely related to my life origin, my soul origin!" Chi Yue said thoughtfully.

Everything in the world had an origin: stars had Stellar Origin, and martial artists naturally had their own origins — origins were the root of existence; without them, all would turn to dust.

The force transformed from Saint Yuan within their bodies was precisely linked to their own origins.
