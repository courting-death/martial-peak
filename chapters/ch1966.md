## Chapter 1966 — Parting Ways

Over a hundred thousand li from Biyu Mountain, two streaks of light cut across the sky like thunder and shot down toward a concealed spot below.

When the light faded, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun's figures were revealed.

"We've already escaped?" Liu Qianyun's pretty face lit up with surprise and disbelief, her bright eyes sparkling with excitement.

As she raced onward, she was surprised to find there wasn't the slightest hindrance — after all, she and Yang Kai were now recognized disciples of the Biyu Sect and wore identity tokens; if anyone stopped them to question them, a quick show of the token would let them pass untroubled.

After leaving Biyu Mountain, the two had flown in this direction and only descended once they judged the distance to be about right.

Over a hundred thousand li was already a safe distance, and besides, the Biyu Sect was probably in chaos right now—no one would care about two disciples having run off.

This was also thanks to Bian Yuqing and Kou Wu and the others all being absent from the sect.

"Brother Yang, we've really escaped," Liu Qianyun said, still basking in excitement with a smile on her face.

Yang Kai, however, did not look pleased; he waved to Liu Qianyun with a grave expression, then pulled several Spatial Rings from his pocket and sent out his Divine Sense to probe them.

Those Spatial Rings had belonged to enemies he had killed in the Bone Prison—there were only four in total.

After checking, Yang Kai quickly learned what each ring contained; he kept one Spatial Ring and shoved the others into Liu Qianyun's hands, saying, "Take these."

"Brother Yang, what are you doing?" Liu Qianyun asked, staring at him blankly.

"Nothing. From now on, you and I will go our separate ways," Yang Kai said solemnly.

At his words, Liu Qianyun trembled and asked awkwardly, "Brother Yang, do you think I have been holding you back?"

Yang Kai frowned, was silent for a moment, then nodded and said, "Yes."

Liu Qianyun looked at him earnestly, then bit her lip and said, "No! Brother Yang, tell me the truth—is some danger approaching? Is it related to that Senior Wu?"

"Why are you asking so many questions?" Yang Kai said with an impatient expression. "Are you women all this nagging? I told you to take the things and leave."

Liu Qianyun bared her teeth and glared at him, her chest heaving. In a low voice she said, "You have taken care of me quite a bit recently; if Brother Yang is in danger, Qianyun will not sit idly by."

"What danger could I be in?" Yang Kai laughed in irritation. "Either way, we'll mind our own business from now on: you take your sunny path, I'll take my lone bridge—let's part here. Good luck!"

After speaking, Yang Kai directly urged his power and tore through the void.

"You think you can just walk away like that?" Liu Qianyun's brows arched; she snorted and immediately gave chase.

Although she did not know why Yang Kai acted that way, from her impressions over recent days he was not that kind of heartless person; she concluded he must have encountered grave trouble and did not want to drag her down, hence the separation.

But Liu Qianyun would not be ungrateful—she certainly would not let Yang Kai face danger alone.

Even if her own strength was limited, two together were always better than one alone.

To her astonishment, after chasing for a while she lost track of Yang Kai; his speed was absurd—speed no Void King-Stage expert should possess—and where he had passed there remained a faint ripple of Spatial Force.

Liu Qianyun knew Yang Kai was versed in Spatial Force; he had used it during the battle with Yin Lesheng in the Starlight Passage.

Trying to chase someone skilled in Spatial Force who was determined to escape was undoubtedly asking too much.

So Liu Qianyun chased for a time and then had to give up; after landing she sighed softly and gazed toward the direction Yang Kai had vanished, murmuring, "Thanks for everything—take good care of yourself!"

She opened her palm to the Spatial Ring and swept it with Divine Sense; she quickly found that the ring contained many Source Crystals and Secret Treasures, and one ring held the greatest wealth—it was clearly Zhou Yi's ring.

"That really fits his character," Liu Qianyun said with a bitter smile; Yang Kai had taken only a ring belonging to a Void King-Stage warrior and left the vast majority of the spoils to her, evidently worried she would lack cultivation resources in the near future.

...

High above, Yang Kai flew alone.

The reason he chose to part with Liu Qianyun was that an unease gnawed at him, and that unease stemmed from Wu Mengchuan.

He did not know exactly what schemes Wu Mengchuan was plotting, but he did not believe the old man would kindly let him be—especially now that he had learned the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

He was certainly up to some scheme!

The old man was a Dao Origin Realm expert, possibly halfway into the Emperor realm, and Yang Kai had no confidence in facing him; to avoid dragging Liu Qianyun into it, he had to separate from her.

Liu Qianyun was a Void King and a domineering figure within her own Star Domain; he believed she could take care of herself even inside the Star Realm.

If truly misfortune struck, then that would simply be the end of her opportunity.

Now Yang Kai only wanted to put as much distance between himself and the Biyu Sect as possible, so he had no intention of stopping—he kept his head down and pressed onward.

As he traveled he took in the Star Realm's landscapes: towering mountains and rivers rich with Spiritual Qi abounded; the cultivation environment far surpassed any Cultivation Star in his homeland. At night he looked up to see countless nebulae—each one marking a Star Domain.

He flew on for over a month before he felt even a little safe.

He was now likely several tens of millions of li from the Biyu Sect; even if Wu Mengchuan possessed Dao Origin Realm power, he could not act against him across such a distance.

He stopped midair, looked around, and all he saw was desolation.

He did not know where he was; fresh to the Star Realm, he only knew it was divided into four great regions and that he should still be in the Southern Territory.

He slowed his pace and moved forward carefully, recovering his strength while looking for somewhere life clustered.

Half a day later he finally discovered something.

Ahead, a war-chariot-shaped flying Secret Treasure approached; from its energy ripples it was clearly a mid-grade Void King-Grade Secret Treasure, and it moved with astonishing speed.

Yang Kai hurriedly stepped aside and waved, hoping to stop them and ask about the location of nearby cities.

Little did he know the other had no intention of stopping; the chariot sped past not far from him, and the warrior riding it did not even glance at Yang Kai before leaving in a trail of dust.

"So cold!" Yang Kai muttered, depressed.

But soon he noticed many lights rapidly closing in behind the chariot.

"What's going on?" Yang Kai was puzzled, initially thinking he had been dragged into some pursuit; but after sensing carefully he realized that was not the case—for those behind carried no killing intent and were not targeting the warrior on the chariot.

They looked as if they were hurrying to converge on some place.

He wondered what was happening.

Yang Kai stood there waving, trying to get someone to explain, but they completely ignored him and showed no intention of paying him any attention.

Yang Kai felt extremely embarrassed.

Still, he had learned something: the Star Realm's forging arts were truly extraordinary; just from the flying Secret Treasures the warriors used he could tell they came in all manner of forms.

There were plain long-sword shapes, shuttle shapes, chariot shapes, tower-ship shapes, palanquin shapes, and even windmill-shaped treasures—each swift, leaving Yang Kai dazzled.

"Hey, what are you standing there daydreaming for? Hurry and catch up—if you're late you'll miss out on all the benefits," a voice suddenly said from beside him.

Yang Kai turned and saw a tiger-headed chariot, the head lifelike and imposing; on it sat a middle-aged man of Void King-Stage cultivation who looked at him curiously.

Overjoyed, he hastily cupped his fists and said, "Greetings, friend."

The middle-aged man nodded boldly, appraised Yang Kai up and down, and asked thoughtfully, "You're... not from Fenglin City, are you?"

"Fenglin City?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and slowly shook his head. "No. May I ask how far Fenglin City is from here?"

"Head this way and it's about a hundred thousand li," the man helpfully pointed out, then grinned, "But are you sure you're going to Fenglin City and not just going to join the excitement?"

"I was just about to ask—what are you all rushing to?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

The man smiled mysteriously. "Ten thousand li away, someone in Yuqing Mountain discovered a wondrous Fire Bird. It seems to be an Artifact Spirit come to life; everyone wants to capture it and refine it into the Artifact Spirit of their Secret Treasure."

"A Fire Bird? An Artifact Spirit?" Yang Kai was startled.

"If you want to go to Fenglin City, just head straight; if you want to join the crowd, don't be late." With that the man drove the chariot away at speed.

Yang Kai stood dumbfounded, a strange excitement welling in his chest.

Though the man's description was vague, if it was true then the one in Yuqing Mountain might be Liu Yan!

Liu Yan's true form was that of a Fire Bird—an Artifact Spirit that had awakened and gained sentience.

Such an existence as Liu Yan held enormous allure for all warriors.

There was no other reason: the birth of an Artifact Spirit was no small thing; it required great opportunity and luck.
