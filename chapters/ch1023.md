## Chapter 1023 — Second Stage of the Saint Realm

The mountain where the Ghost Ancestor originally resided was once lush and verdant, a place of scenic beauty, alive with birdsong and the fragrance of flowers.

But now the whole peak looked as if it had been set ablaze; the summit was stripped bare, the ground a carpet of scorched earth and withered timber, with none of its former beauty remaining.

Even the formation laid here to gather Spiritual Qi had apparently been destroyed.

Within the mountain’s belly, the spirit stream had vanished without a trace, entirely dried up; the brook that once flowed through it was long gone.

Inside a stone chamber, an invisible vortex whirled, drawing the world’s Spiritual Qi to this spot and then absorbing it.

The Ghost Ancestor’s figure appeared leisurely, standing before Yang Kai, frowning as he stared at him without moving.

Yang Kai seemed entirely unaware; only after a long while did he softly inhale and cease the operation of his profound art.

After quietly examining himself for a moment, Yang Kai’s expression brightened with exhilaration.

In his Dantian the Yang Liquid and the demonic energy within his Indomitable Golden Body had all disappeared, having fused together into a new force that combined the traits of both yet surpassed Yang Yuan and demonic energy in strength and lethality.

This power flowed gently through his meridians, nourishing every inch of flesh and was stored within the Indomitable Golden Body.

Yang Kai felt renewed from the inside out, as if reborn; his whole body brimmed with an unparalleled explosive power.

A single enlightenment and one session of cultivation had brought him earth-shattering change!

He even felt he could go toe-to-toe in battle with a Saint King Realm expert!

His cultivation realm had likewise increased; without hindrance he rose to the Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

Yang Kai didn’t even know exactly when he had broken through — he had been lost in the process of fusing the two forces and unaware of other matters; this unexpected boon only made him more delighted.

At a thought, Yang Kai attempted to manifest the Demon God Transformation.

Invisible demonic marks crawled up, sinking into his flesh; in an instant the power of his Qi and blood surged wildly, and the fluctuations of life rose frantically...

It appeared the Demon God Transformation could still be performed. Yang Kai’s heart settled — after fusion the power possessed all the characteristics of both Yang Yuan and demonic energy.

“Not bad, not bad. You truly are remarkable!” the Ghost Ancestor’s voice suddenly came from before him, sincere in praise.

Yang Kai opened his eyes, dispelled the Demon God Transformation, clasped his fist in salute, and said, “Senior, I thank you for your instruction the other day.”

The Ghost Ancestor’s expression was odd. He snorted coldly: “I didn’t teach you anything. Don’t thank me!”

Yang Kai chuckled: “Perhaps you only spoke casually. But if not for that remark of yours, it might have taken me years, decades, or even longer to reach this point. So in any case, I must thank you for the enlightenment!”

“Think whatever you like!” the Ghost Ancestor waved impatiently, unwilling to be drawn into further connection with Yang Kai, and said in a deep voice, “You’ve been in seclusion for over a month; I gave you plenty of time to improve your strength, and now you’ve succeeded — isn’t it time to do your duty?”

He stared coldly at Yang Kai, evidently displeased at having waited so long.

Yang Kai hastily nodded: “I’ll begin right away. But before that, I want to take a look at that Space Array.”

“As you wish. Do whatever you like, as long as you can find a way out. But remember this—if you fail to do so, this old man will rip out your soul and torment you for eternity. Disappoint me, and you’ll meet a fate worse than death!”

He issued the threat, then casually sent a blot of jet-black energy into Yang Kai’s body, which vanished in an instant.

The black energy traveled through Yang Kai and soon appeared on his arm as a mark shaped like a horrifying human face.

Within it was the Ghost Ancestor’s Divine Sense; through the mark the Ghost Ancestor could monitor Yang Kai’s every move.

Yang Kai smiled wryly, shook his head, and strode out.

Before long he left the mountain’s belly and came to the flatland where the Space Array had been laid.

That Space Array had been idle ever since the Ghost Ancestor last used it; countless Saint Crystals within the great formation had dimmed and the energy stored inside was nearly exhausted. The space gate forged from warship fragments still stood, its frame covered with a thin layer of Ethereal Crystal.

Yang Kai had more than once secretly observed this Space Array, hoping to gain inspiration to deepen his understanding of spatial formations.

Only when he scrutinized it so closely now did he realize that while the Ghost Ancestor might be lacking in true mastery of space, after a thousand years of study he had formed his own insights.

He had even thought to use Ethereal Crystal as the key to opening the Void Passage, a medium to stabilize the Void Passage.

Unfortunately, the gate used to form the Void Passage had been forged from fragments of a Saint King-Grade warship; its quality was still somewhat inferior, and the Ethereal Crystal covering the frame was scant, which was why the Void Passage the Ghost Ancestor opened was so chaotic and unstable and could collapse at any moment.

If given sufficient materials, he might well be capable of successfully arranging a stable Space Array; where such an array would send a person, however, the Ghost Ancestor probably did not even know.

Yang Kai studied the Space Array, comprehending the Ghost Ancestor’s research into the mysteries of space and making it his own, his expression focused.

After a moment, the sound of footsteps suddenly came.

Yang Kai turned and found that all the living people on this continent had come over.

It seemed they had seen Yang Kai emerge from seclusion and hurried here.

“Master...” Bi Ya paid no heed to the scornful glances, called to him warmly, and came to Yang Kai with a smile: “Congratulations, Master, on your great increase in strength and your enlightenment.”

This time she truly wished to submit to Yang Kai and remain by his side; her manner was no longer the earlier flattering pretense, so her smile was radiant.

Yang Kai lightly inclined his head.

“Brother, it’s good you’re fine. Don’t tangle with such dangerous things again,” Shen Tu laughed heartily, though a deep puzzlement flickered in his eyes.

He still didn’t clearly know Yang Kai’s real bottom line. Inside the Purple Star ship Yang Kai had suddenly erupted and slain a Third Stage of the Saint Realm warrior, but that explosive ambush did not prove much.

Shen Tu continued to speculate about Yang Kai’s true strength.

Before Yang Kai’s seclusion he hadn’t felt any pressure from him, but whenever he was near Yang Kai there was a voice in his heart shouting:

If they ever fought, it would be him who died!

That was Shen Tu’s instinct as a martial artist, which made him suspect Yang Kai was concealing his cultivation and strength.

Yet upon seeing him again, Shen Tu found Yang Kai felt less threatening than before; that instinctive warning did not flare up this time.

Shen Tu was puzzled and unsure what Yang Kai’s seclusion and the great commotion it caused had meant — was it a success or a failure?

Still, his rise in cultivation was evident to all.

“I’ll be careful in future,” Yang Kai said with a chuckle.

The He Zao and He Miao sisters smiled and nodded at Yang Kai, happy at his safety. Yue Xi stood behind her two disciples with a slightly awkward, stern face.

Nearby, Lü Guichen forced a somewhat strained smile and nodded at him. “Little brother, there’s one thing we’ve never understood. If it’s convenient, could you tell us?”

Yang Kai glanced at him and asked mildly, “What is it?”

Lü Guichen looked around, gathered himself, and said in a low voice: “You once said the Ghost Ancestor had a favor to ask of you — what did he ask you to do?”

At these words everyone looked toward Yang Kai, expecting an answer.

They really did not know why someone of mere Saint Realm cultivation like Yang Kai would reach an agreement with a figure like the Ghost Ancestor.

What could the Ghost Ancestor possibly want with him?

“You can ask the Ghost Ancestor yourself; if he’s willing to tell you, he will,” Yang Kai said with a light smile.

Lü Guichen’s face reddened and he fell silent.

Seeing the Ghost Ancestor, he could hardly hide fast enough — how could he dare question him about such things? If he so much as displeased the old monster, he’d probably be crushed to death on the spot.

“Boy, if you keep wasting time chatting with them, this old man will make you suffer!” The Ghost Ancestor’s voice suddenly rang in his ear, filled with impatience. Yang Kai’s expression changed; clasping his fists, he said, “Apologies—Senior is urging me. I won’t say more.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai already summoned the Star Shuttle and vanished like a blue rainbow.

Ten thousand li from the mountain’s mid-slope, Yang Kai halted.

The ability to rend space in such a way was known only to the Ghost Ancestor and was one of Yang Kai’s trump cards, so he was unwilling to expose it — at least not to someone like Lü Guichen.

He glanced about, circulated his power into his fingertip, and tore.

A rift in space immediately appeared; inside it was dark and cold, hollow and void, and eerie, inexplicable fluctuations issued from within.

Yang Kai did not rush inside; he stared blankly at the rift.

Previously, when he had torn space, the cut had been as clean as a blade.

But now, the edges of the tear burned with clusters of black demonic flame that flickered between cold and heat, shifting wildly and eluding pattern.

It seemed able even to burn away space itself, preventing the rift from sealing.

Yang Kai’s expression was strange.

He had not expected the new demonic flame born of the fused forces to be so uncanny.

It appeared necessary to reassess himself.

Without lingering further, Yang Kai stepped into the rift; at the motion of his Divine Sense the demonic flame suddenly extinguished and the torn space reknit.

Standing amid the spatial turbulence, Yang Kai remained calm and glanced at the human-face mark the Ghost Ancestor had branded on his arm, sneering.

Yang Kai knew better than anyone what the Ghost Ancestor had in mind.

The reason the Ghost Ancestor had not killed him and instead urged him to find the way out was to observe how he tore the void and how the turbulence behaved, so as to augment his own understanding of spatial mysteries.

He wanted to steal this technique.

Someone like the Ghost Ancestor would never stake all his hopes on Yang Kai; he had other designs of his own!
