## Chapter 1993 — Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda

Time flashed by, and it was already noon.

Duan Yuanshan hurried up to Xiao Yuyang's side on the high platform, bowed with a smile and whispered a few words of consultation; after receiving an affirmative reply he turned, drew in a breath and cried out in a loud voice: "Friends of Fenglin City, please be quiet……"

At once everyone understood the spectacle was about to begin; they immediately fell silent, kept still, and fixed their gaze upon the high platform.

Duan Yuanshan smiled faintly, clasped his hands and said: "Thanks to Star Envoy Xiao of Star God Palace for the boon of opening the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda in our Fenglin City, and with help from Tianwu Sacred Land, Wuhua Hall, Qingyang Shrine, the Ziyuan Commerce Guild and the Qiyao Commerce Guild, a large number of heaven-and-earth treasures, cultivation manuals, and Secret Treasures have been placed inside. The favor granted to us today is deeply appreciated by all in Fenglin City and will be remembered; I, as city lord, offer thanks on behalf of Fenglin City's friends and wish that your Martial Dao may climb ever higher, may you all be blessed……"

Duan Yuanshan began to speak without pause, his words full of praise and flattery, clearly well prepared.

But before he could finish, Xiao Yuyang frowned impatiently and said, "Enough chatter, get to the point!"

Though being reprimanded in front of countless martial artists from the whole city, Duan Yuanshan did not dare show the slightest displeasure; instead he hastened to nod, reflected for a moment, and continued: "The time has come—please, great lords, open the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda. Once you enter the tower, life, death, wealth—each will follow heaven's decree!"

When his words fell, the six Emperor Realm figures rose up.

The gazes of the countless people below the platform also turned toward the six.

The one in the center, Xiao Yuyang, let out a long roar and suddenly formed arcane hand seals. The surrounding Heaven-and-Earth Energy began to hum in waves, and a majestic pressure surged from him, filling many Void King Realm martial artists with both longing and dread.

It was not only the Void King Realm warriors—indeed the other five Emperor Realm figures were also staring unblinkingly at Xiao Yuyang, as if trying to glean some clue from his movements.

Xiao Yuyang's hands moved with incredible speed, flitting so fast they left behind heavy afterimages, making it seem as if he had grown countless arms.

With a light shout, Xiao Yuyang suddenly pointed his hand forward.

At a spot ahead, a mystic rune pattern abruptly manifested.

Then Xiao Yuyang used his finger as a brush, the laws of Heaven-and-Earth as ink, the void as cloth, and one rune after another slowly took shape. The moment these runes appeared they began to flow according to a fixed rhythm, as if they were living things.

Hissing sounds rang out incessantly.

Some unfathomable force splashed through the void and burst outward.

Before long, a circular, massive rune pattern about ten zhang across presented itself to everyone.

Xiao Yuyang bellowed again, "I ask for your aid, everyone!"

As his voice fell, the other five Emperor Realm figures moved in a flash, their forms flickering as they took positions at five different points; each employed their means to pour their pure and massive Origin Qi into the rune pattern.

The entire pattern began to spin round and round.

And as the six Emperor Realm experts injected their power, the pattern spun faster and faster, making one dizzy and unwell at a glance.

The six's faces remained solemn, yet the process of pouring in their Origin Qi clearly cost them greatly; before long, aside from Xiao Yuyang, the other five all showed somewhat pale faces.

Fortunately the process did not last long; when the huge rune pattern suddenly condensed into a stable gate of light, Xiao Yuyang cried out: "Have the Great Emperor strike!"

As his words fell, a palm flashed through from within the light gate; as if some barrier had been shattered, the interior of the stabilized gate suddenly revealed the shadow of a treasure pagoda, which radiated five-hued mists and rose to an unknown height—no one could make out its true appearance.

"Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda!"

The martial artists below the platform cried out in astonishment, eyes wide as they greedily stared at the towering pagoda suffused with prismatic light.

It was plainly the Star God Palace's supreme Imperial Treasure famed throughout the Star Realm: the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda. Countless people had only heard rumors of the tower and had never seen it with their own eyes; now not only were they seeing it, they would soon enter it.

At the thought, everyone could not help but breathe more rapidly.

"You've worked hard," Xiao Yuyang murmured, nodding slightly to the other five.

The five, who seemed to be severely drained, said little and swiftly returned to their original places, closing their eyes to recuperate.

At that moment a Spatial Ring appeared in Xiao Yuyang's hand; he smiled faintly, tossed the ring toward the light gate and flicked his fingers.

The Spatial Ring shattered instantaneously, and from within the ring hundreds to thousands of multicolored beams shot forth like arrows, streaking toward the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda.

"This is……"

"Those are treasures put in by the major forces—I've spotted a Secret Treasure!"

"Wow, could that possibly be a Dao Origin Fruit? If I obtain that fruit, I could advance to Dao Origin Realm."

"There are only three Dao Origin Fruits, yet tens of thousands of people have gathered here; do you really think you can get one?"

"If I don't get it, you won't either!"

……

Upon learning that the lights were treasures contributed by several top forces and placed within the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, everyone grew excited, and the presence of Dao Origin Fruit in particular set the nerves and blood of the Void King Realm warriors alight.

Though stirred, no one dared act rashly—after all, Xiao Yuyang was watching.

Xiao Yuyang smiled slightly: "You may enter."

At his words, the long-waiting martial artists could no longer restrain themselves; they unleashed body techniques and secret arts and charged toward the light gate, fearing any delay would leave them behind.

For a time the square before the city lord's manor grew uproarious and chaotic.

Even before entering, martial artists began fighting over the order of entry.

Xiao Yuyang paid them no mind, though his eyes were fixed on a certain woman in the crowd; seeing her glance his way, he only nodded slightly and secretly snapped his fingers, sending a gentle force that struck her.

Yang Kai and his two companions were mixed among the crowd, squeezed and jostled by the chaotic flow, suffering greatly.

Those who inadvertently touched Mo Xiaoqi were in for a bad time—like being pricked by sharp needles, they cried out in pain and hastily gave way.

Yang Kai signaled to Mo Xiaoqi; she understood at once and resolutely went forward to clear the path.

After some twists and turns, they finally broke through to the vicinity of the light gate and surged inside.

That familiar sensation of long-distance transmission struck again; Yang Kai steadied his Divine Sense and in a short while his vision blurred and he arrived within a most peculiar environment.

The first thing he sensed was that the Spiritual Qi in this place was not rich, but rather thin.

Yet between those heavens and earth there existed a force that drew martial artists like moths to flame—the Power of the Laws!

Although the Power of the Laws here felt strange and not as whole as in the outside world—more fragmented and broken in state—precisely because of that condition it made it easier for people to comprehend and to understand.

No wonder the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda had become a rite of passage that Star God Palace disciples must enter; in such a special environment, the palace's cultivators could touch the threshold of the laws more easily than others. Though the fragmented Power of the Laws had its flaws and could not reveal true mysteries, it was ideal as an entry point.

After Void King Realm comes Dao Origin Realm, and to ascend to Dao Origin one must perceive the laws of Heaven and Earth.

With the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda as a treasure, Star God Palace disciples had at least a thirty percent easier chance than others at passing the Dao Origin Realm barrier.

That was an extremely fearsome probability.

No sooner had Yang Kai finished that thought than an exceedingly piercing scream rang out from not far away.

He was startled and quickly turned his head.

He discovered that not far from him a martial artist who had arrived earlier had his throat ripped open by a crocodile-like demonic beast, blood spurting forth like a fountain as the man clutched his throat but could not staunch the flow.

Moreover, more crocodile demonic beasts were seizing his legs and arms, frantically dragging him beneath the grass.

Gurgle……

In the blink of an eye the martial artist vanished without a trace, leaving only murky mud and splashing, filthy water.

The place was, it turned out, a swamp!

The unlucky martial artist had clearly arrived here before him; but after being transmitted he suffered a momentary dizziness, couldn't regain his bearings in time, and was seized by those treacherous hands.

Even if Yang Kai had wanted to move earlier, it would have been too late.

The ferocious beasts hidden beneath the marsh were far too quick.

With a splash, Yang Kai's peripheral vision caught a crocodile-like fiend identical to the one that had killed the martial artist bursting from the marsh; its eyes were blood-red and its face savage and terrifying as it gaped toward Yang Kai's throat.

Having learned from the previous man's fate, Yang Kai did not dare delay; he flashed and hurled a punch, his fist erupting in prismatic light that struck the crocodile's skull.

A clanging sound……

As if striking forged metal, sparks flew; the crocodile was knocked backward and tumbled into the mud pit before him.

Yet it did not die instantly; with a flick of its tail it dove beneath the mud.

Only then did Yang Kai have the leisure to release his Divine Sense.

The next moment his expression darkened.

In his perception, from all directions there were countless life fluctuations exuding fierce auras, hidden beneath the grass and mud and silently closing in on him.

These things were clearly the same kind of crocodile fiends; each was not individually powerful, roughly the peak of Ninth-Tier demonic beasts, equivalent to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Such demonic beasts truly counted for little in Yang Kai's estimation.

But… their numbers were simply too great, and Yang Kai truly did not wish to tangle with them.
