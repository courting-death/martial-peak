## Chapter 2298 — Making a Scene

The young girl walked straight in, accompanied closely by a young man at her side. The youth had rosy lips and white teeth, a graceful bearing, and held a folding fan in his hand. He looked every bit the dashing gentleman—none other than Qiu Yu of Tianzhao Palace!

As Yang Kai met his gaze, Qiu Yu was momentarily stunned, then smiled and said, "It's you?"

Yang Kai covered his face with his hand, turned sideways, and said, "It's not me, you've got the wrong person!"

Qiu Yu looked utterly baffled, not knowing what Yang Kai was up to.

The young girl also curiously sized up Yang Kai, then looked at Qiu Yu and asked, "Brother Yu, do you know this person?"

Qiu Yu chuckled, "I suppose I know him, but we're not close."

"Oh." The girl nodded, acting brashly, and patted Yang Kai's shoulder. "Hey, you! Brother Yu is talking to you, how dare you ignore him?"

Yang Kai shrugged off her hand, glared at her impatiently, and said, "Men and women shouldn't touch so casually. Didn't your elders teach you that? What are you doing patting strangers on the street?"

The girl's face flushed red, and she bit her lip. "You dare lecture me?"

Qiu Yu smiled and said, "No need to stoop to his level, Sister Bing. This fellow is always sneaky—he was the same at the city gate, sneaking in under the Thousand Leaves Sect's name. Who knows what he's up to."

"He's with the Thousand Leaves Sect?" Luo Bing's face darkened, clearly not having a good impression of the Thousand Leaves Sect.

"Exactly!" Qiu Yu nodded slightly.

Luo Bing immediately said, "Then he must be up to no good! You, explain yourself—why did you sneak into the city? Are you plotting something?"

She actually started questioning Yang Kai to his face.

Yang Kai looked speechless, staring at her, thinking this little girl must be spoiled and a bit naive.

With a thought, Yang Kai let out a cold chuckle.

Luo Bing said with disgust, "Even your laugh is gross... Hurry up and tell me, what are you really here for?"

Yang Kai grinned wickedly and said, "What else could I be here for? I’ve heard Tianhe City is famed for its beauties—naturally, I came to steal a glance at some fragrant flowers and jade faces... Especially those fresh, delicate young ladies with skin like water—just my type!"

As he spoke, he took a deep breath, looking intoxicated, and continued, "Smells so sweet, so fragrant—just a taste, and it's delicious. Tsk tsk tsk..."

Luo Bing was so startled her face turned pale, and she stepped back a few paces, unable to say a word, as if truly frightened.

Qiu Yu frowned, stepped in front of Luo Bing, and snorted coldly, "Watch your mouth, friend. You can eat whatever you want, but you can't say whatever you want—some words can get you killed."

Yang Kai laughed, shrugged, and said, "You were the ones insisting I snuck in with ulterior motives. I'm just playing along."

Luo Bing snapped back to her senses, jumped out from behind Qiu Yu, and shouted, "You dare scare me? Do you know who I am?"

Yang Kai glanced at her with disdain, "No idea. Leave me alone, you're annoying."

"He actually... told me to leave him alone?" Luo Bing's beautiful eyes widened in anger, her chest heaving. She was the daughter of Tianhe City's City Lord, with a noble status, wealthy family, and outstanding looks. Ever since she grew up, suitors were never lacking—Qiu Yu of Tianzhao Palace always accompanied her whenever he visited Tianhe City, never leaving her side like a guardian, and Luo Jin would grant her every wish.

She had always lived surrounded by admiration, cherished by all, and had truly never been so disliked by any man before.

For a moment, she felt utterly wronged, stomped her foot, and said, "You... you... I'll make you pay!"

Yang Kai's face darkened at her words.

Though he wasn't afraid of Tianhe City, if he really clashed with Luo Bing, it might implicate the Thousand Leaves Sect, which he didn't want.

Luo Bing shouted, quickly striding up to Yang Kai, craning her slender neck and glaring fiercely at him.

As Yang Kai stayed alert, she suddenly turned and pointed at the goods on the counter, shouting to the shopkeeper, "He bought these, right?"

The shopkeeper nodded instinctively, "That's right!"

"Good!" Luo Bing gritted her teeth. "I'll buy all of these—don't sell him a single one!"

Yang Kai's face instantly darkened.

Qiu Yu was also stunned, thinking, is this how you're going to make him pay? Isn't this a bit too far-fetched?

The shopkeeper looked troubled, "Miss Luo, these items were chosen by this customer, and the prices have already been calculated."

"They haven't been paid for yet, right?" Luo Bing asked.

The shopkeeper hesitated, "No, not yet."

"Then that's fine, I'll take them all." Luo Bing snorted proudly, looking at Yang Kai with a "try to fight me" attitude.

Yang Kai looked utterly speechless, feeling more and more that this girl was spoiled—even her anger was misplaced.

The shopkeeper took a deep breath, "Miss Luo, these goods were chosen by this customer. If he insists on buying them, I must sell them to him, so I'm afraid I can't fulfill your request."

"What?" Luo Bing's face fell, staring at the shopkeeper. "Didn't you hear what I just said?"

The shopkeeper replied calmly, "Our shop has its own rules. Please understand, Miss Luo."

Though the shop wasn't large, it was still a property of Ziyuan Commerce Guild, representing the guild. So even though Luo Bing was the City Lord's daughter, the shopkeeper wasn't too afraid of her, nor would he offend other customers and damage the guild's reputation.

If he did offend the City Lord's daughter, the higher-ups would handle it. Besides, if Luo Jin learned the reason, he probably wouldn't make trouble for the shop.

"You..." Luo Bing's face turned red with anger.

Qiu Yu said, "Sister Bing, let it go. It's just some medicinal herbs. If you can't buy them here, you can get them elsewhere."

"No, I must buy them today!" Luo Bing puffed out her cheeks, not even sure who she was angry at, and said, "Shopkeeper, tell me—how much for all these? I'll pay double!"

The shopkeeper rubbed his forehead and smiled bitterly, "The shop's rules can't be broken!"

Yang Kai laughed, "Shopkeeper, only a fool wouldn't take the money. Since this young lady is willing to pay double, just sell them to her."

The shopkeeper immediately gave Yang Kai a grateful look and bowed, "Thank you for your generosity, sir."

Luo Bing shouted, "Why does it sound like he's giving them to me? I'm snatching them!"

"Yes, yes! You're snatching them—I'm completely defeated!" Yang Kai nodded repeatedly.

"That's more like it!" Luo Bing's face softened, and she proudly tapped the table, "Tell me, how many Source Crystals is it?"

The shopkeeper looked at his abacus and said, "If this gentleman buys them, it's eighteen million six hundred and forty-three thousand Source Crystals. The small change can be rounded off—let's say eighteen million six hundred thousand. So Miss Luo, you'll need to pay thirty-seven million two hundred thousand Source Crystals!"

"Gulp..." Luo Bing couldn't help but swallow, stammering, "How... how much?"

The shopkeeper calmly repeated the price.

Even Qiu Yu couldn't help but widen his eyes in shock, staring at Yang Kai.

He never imagined Yang Kai's purchases would cost so many Source Crystals. Such a sum would move most Dao Origin Realm cultivators—even Qiu Yu, as the Young Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace, didn't have that much.

With such wealth, it was clear Yang Kai was no ordinary martial artist.

Luo Bing was dumbfounded, not recovering for a long time.

After a while, she finally said hoarsely, "Shopkeeper, are you sure you didn't miscalculate?"

The shopkeeper replied with dignity, "I've managed this shop for thirty years—never made a mistake."

Yang Kai grinned, "What, Miss Luo, can't afford it?"

"Who says I can't!" Luo Bing retorted, jumping like a rabbit whose tail had been stepped on. "This amount of Source Crystals... is nothing! My father gives me much more pocket money than this..."

"Indeed." Yang Kai nodded, cupping his fists. "Miss Luo is truly wealthy—I'm impressed!"

Luo Bing muttered, "I just left in a hurry today and didn't bring it with me."

Yang Kai smiled, glancing at her, "Miss Luo, are you thinking of buying on credit?"

"Who said I want credit!" Luo Bing's face reddened—she had indeed considered it, but after Yang Kai teased her, she couldn't bring herself to do it. She could only look pitifully at Qiu Yu, "Brother Yu..."

Qiu Yu instinctively touched his Spatial Ring, his mouth twitching, "Sister Bing, I only have ten million..."

Luo Bing stomped her foot, "Why didn't you bring more Source Crystals?"

Qiu Yu looked helpless, thinking ten million was already a lot—his entire savings, in fact. Even if he had more, he couldn't take it out now. Besides, if he spent it all just to buy some herbs out of spite, Luo Bing would never pay him back.

Thinking of this, Qiu Yu glared at Yang Kai, blaming him for making trouble and putting him in a tough spot.

Yang Kai pretended not to notice, laughed, and said, "Miss Luo didn't bring enough money, so I'll just take the herbs myself."

"Stop!" Luo Bing shouted, throwing herself over the herbs, guarding them as if they were precious treasures, and yelled at Yang Kai, "Wait! I'll go ask my father for enough Source Crystals!"

"Will the City Lord give them to you?" Yang Kai sneered.

If Luo Jin hadn't lost his mind, he would never give Luo Bing such a huge sum of Source Crystals just to satisfy her whim—more likely, he'd send someone to teach Yang Kai a lesson.
