## Chapter 2 — Breaking Through the Southern Wall Without Turning Back

The first rule of Lingxiao Pavilion's Sect Regulations: every disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion has one opportunity to challenge others each day, and once every five days they may be challenged themselves! The combatants’ strength levels must not differ by more than three Stages; evading or shirking battle is forbidden, with violators expelled from the sect. The victor is awarded Contribution Points based on the opponent's level, while the loser loses Contribution Points accordingly.

Contribution Points, also known as Sect Contribution Value, are the currency of Lingxiao Pavilion!

This is Lingxiao Pavilion's unique feature. Simply put, Contribution Points are equivalent to money within the sect. As long as one has enough Contribution Points, anything desired can be exchanged at the sect’s logistics department—pills, secret techniques, weapons, armor, anything related to cultivation. Of course, gold and silver can also be exchanged, but generally speaking, Sect Contribution Value is hard-earned, and ordinary disciples are reluctant to exchange it for mere metals.

There are many ways to earn Contribution Points, such as handing in treasures found during expeditions or completing tasks assigned by the sect.

One of the simplest and most common methods is challenging! Challenge a fellow disciple no more than three Stages stronger or weaker than yourself; victory grants Contribution Points.

That is why so early this morning, so many people had gathered around Yang Kai. Everyone knows to squeeze a soft persimmon.

Yang Kai’s name is well known throughout Lingxiao Pavilion—not only because he bore the rare title of Trial Disciple but because from the time he entered Lingxiao Pavilion until now, he had rarely ever won! Each time he was challenged, the result was inevitably a loss.

Those who paid attention naturally remembered when Yang Kai was last challenged. Today was the fifth day since that time, meaning that by the sect's rules, he was once again open to being challenged. This easy-to-get Contribution Points bounty was irresistible. Though defeating Yang Kai did not award much Contribution Points, every little bit counted. Moreover, the disciples who dared to challenge Yang Kai were hardly affluent or noble—they valued even these modest points.

In the arena, Yang Kai and Zhou Dingjun had taken their stances and said together in unison, “Please instruct me!”

Though they spoke these words, everyone knew that Yang Kai was about to be thoroughly beaten again today!

As the words faded, Yang Kai took the initiative to strike. His slender, fragile frame unleashed astonishing combat power. With a single step forward, he threw a punch directly at Zhou Dingjun’s chest. The attack was simple and direct, the fist roaring with overwhelming force, as if his entire strength had been poured into it.

This punch was actually the Long Fist, a basic form every Lingxiao Pavilion disciple at the lowest level had practiced. This set of boxing techniques was not profound, only meant to strengthen the body. Naturally, the moves were simple.

Zhou Dingjun was unperturbed, a gentle smile crossing his face because his cultivation level was two Stages above Yang Kai. This battle held little suspense. Just as Yang Kai's fist was about to hit, Zhou Dingjun casually twisted his body with an ease like strolling in the park, his burly frame surprisingly nimble.

The fist grazed his clothes but did not touch Zhou Dingjun.

Before Yang Kai could retract his punch, Zhou Dingjun's elbow struck Yang Kai’s forearm while his knee sharply rose, connecting with Yang Kai’s abdomen.

Yang Kai stifled a groan, enduring the piercing pain. His footing faltered as he hurriedly retreated, narrowly avoiding Zhou Dingjun's third follow-up strike.

“Hm?” Zhou Dingjun was taken aback; he had not expected this Third Stage of Body Tempering senior brother to anticipate his move. This disrupted Zhou Dingjun’s plan to crush him at once.

But the minor mistake did not affect the overall situation. Zhou Dingjun shifted his thoughts and swiftly followed like a shadow, intending to end the fight while Yang Kai caught his breath.

Unexpectedly, as Zhou Dingjun moved forward, Yang Kai suddenly lunged again. The two figures closed rapidly, and Zhou Dingjun saw the unyielding defiance and burning fighting spirit in Yang Kai's eyes. Yang Kai clenched his fist and launched another Long Fist.

Damn! Zhou Dingjun’s heart skipped a beat, realizing he had fallen into Yang Kai’s trap. Though his cultivation was two Stages higher, his combat experience was inferior.

But even so, what of that? Zhou Dingjun grounded his breath deeply and stopped dodging, returning the Long Fist in kind.

Two soft thuds echoed. Yang Kai was flung away, while Zhou Dingjun's figure trembled slightly but remained standing, his expression a bit stern. Had the same punch been exchanged between equals, Zhou Dingjun would certainly have been the one knocked back.

Others might not have noticed the subtleties of the two punches, but Zhou Dingjun had clearly felt it. Yang Kai’s fist was actually faster, meaning he hit first, then Zhou Dingjun’s return blow landed.

However, Yang Kai’s punches lacked power, and Zhou Dingjun was physically strong and robust. In contrast, Yang Kai was thin as a dried fish, his body frail, face pale—clearly malnourished. His resilience was not on par, so the current outcome was no surprise.

“Senior Brother Ye, thank you for the match!” Zhou Dingjun felt awkward inside. It was no pride to be struck first by a disciple two Stages below him. Though he was winning, it didn’t feel satisfying.

Whispers came from the side.

“Does this person really think he won?”

“Ha, didn’t he hear of Yang Kai’s reputation before challenging him?”

“This is quite interesting.”

Zhou Dingjun raised his brow. He wasn’t very familiar with Yang Kai but had often heard others mention this senior. Today, passing by a crowd, he joined in and, luck being on his side, was chosen by Yang Kai as an opponent.

But hadn’t he won? He had punched the senior clean away, holding overwhelming advantage. By sect rules, the opponent should concede now, as there was no need to continue.

“Again!” As Zhou Dingjun pondered this, Yang Kai, who had just fallen to the ground, stood up again. His eyes showed no hint of discouragement, only stronger fighting spirit; although being hit had slightly paled his already sickly face.

Before Zhou Dingjun could answer, Yang Kai charged forward again. Less than three feet from Zhou Dingjun, he suddenly sprung and swept his legs like long whips at Zhou Dingjun's lower body.

The Whip Kick! A foundational skill every low-level Lingxiao Pavilion disciple practiced, but as Yang Kai displayed it, many disciples far above him watched with newfound appreciation.

So that’s how the Whip Kick could be used.

Before the crowd could marvel further, a soft thud rang out, and Yang Kai flew back again.

The two-Stages difference and the disparity of physical quality made it impossible for Yang Kai to match Zhou Dingjun. Zhou’s punch struck Yang Kai’s shinbone. When Yang Kai stood up, his steps were slightly unsteady, clearly his bone was injured.

“Again!” Yang Kai gritted his teeth, eyes blazing like a roaring flame.

“Thud...” Yang Kai was flung out.

“Again!”

“Thud...” Again Yang Kai flew back.

Some could no longer bear to watch and left early, while others sighed in admiration. “Yang Kai’s tenacity is incredible. He never gives up, even if knocked unconscious each time!”

This reached Zhou Dingjun’s ears, causing bitterness. He had not expected such a mad opponent in this challenge.

Yang Kai was blasted back seven or eight times, cheeks swollen, eyebags blackened, steps staggering—looking as if a gust of wind would fell him—but still stubborn as a rock, rising exactly where he fell and shouting for more.

After repeated cycles, Zhou Dingjun’s expression changed. “Are you crazy? If you don’t concede soon, you’ll die!”
