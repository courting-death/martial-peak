## Chapter 2 – Break Through the Wall Without Turning Back

Pavilion Rule #1:  
Every Lingxiao Pavilion disciple may issue one challenge per day and must accept one challenge every five days.  
The strength gap between opponents may not exceed three stages.  
Evasion and cowardice are forbidden; violators are expelled.  
The victor gains Contribution Points based on the opponent’s rank; the loser loses Contribution Points based on their own rank.

Contribution Points—also called Sect Contribution Value—are a hallmark of Lingxiao Pavilion. In effect, they are money. With enough points a disciple can exchange for anything they needed: pills, manuals, weapons, armor—anything related to cultivation. Gold and silver can also be redeemed, but because points are hard to earn, few disciples waste them on mundane riches.

There are many ways to gain Contribution Points: turning in treasures found on journeys, completing sect-assigned tasks, and more.  
The simplest, most direct method is challenge—defeat a fellow disciple within three stages of your own strength and you receive points.

That is why so many people surrounded Yang Kai at first light: everyone knew to squeeze the softest persimmon.

Yang Kai’s name was well-known in the Pavilion, not only because he bore the rare status of Trial Disciple, but because since the day he joined he had never won a single match. Every challenge ended in defeat.

The sharp ones remembered the date of his last bout. Today was the fifth day. By rule he could be challenged again. Easy Contribution Points were irresistible. Though beating Yang Kai yielded little, even a mosquito is still meat. Moreover, those who challenged him were hardly wealthy; they would never disdain a few extra points.

In the arena Yang Kai and Zhou Dingjun faced each other. Together they cupped fists. “Please give me guidance.”

Everyone knew Yang Kai was due another beating.

Before the echo faded, Yang Kai attacked first. Though thin and frail, he exploded with surprising force. One step forward, fist driving straight toward Zhou Dingjun’s chest—simple, direct, every ounce of strength poured into it.

This strike was Long Fist, a basic boxing form every beginner practiced. It was not profound, meant only to strengthen the body, so the move was straightforward.

Zhou Dingjun was unhurried, smiling. His realm outclassed Yang Kai’s by two stages; there was no suspense. Only when the fist was about to land did he twist aside with ease; his burly frame suddenly agile.

Yang Kai’s punch brushed cloth. Before he could retract his arm, Zhou’s elbow smashed into his forearm; a rising knee slammed his abdomen.

Yang Kai grunted, forced down the piercing pain, stepped sideways, and retreated just in time to avoid Zhou’s third blow.

“Hm?” Zhou raised a brow. He had not expected this Body Tempering Third Stage senior to read his follow-ups so accurately. His plan for a clean finish was disrupted.

Yet the small slip did not change the outcome. Zhou shadowed him, intent on ending the match while Yang Kai caught his breath.

But before Zhou could move, Yang Kai suddenly lunged forward. The two closed at once. In Yang Kai’s eyes burned stubborn, soaring battle spirit—another Long Fist swung out.

Damn! Zhou’s heart skipped. He realized he had fallen for a feint. Though stronger, he was less seasoned in real combat.

Even so, so what? Zhou settled his breath, no longer dodging, and answered with the same Long Fist.

Two muffled thuds.

Yang Kai flew backward. Zhou staggered but held firm, a hint of gravity in his face. Had the punch come from an equal, he would have been the one hurled away.

Others might not sense it, but Zhou felt it clearly: Yang Kai’s fist had struck first. Only his superior strength and sturdy frame kept him from harm; Yang Kai’s body was thin, malnourished, unable to translate speed into power.

“Senior Brother Yang, thanks for the lesson,” Zhou muttered, bitter. Being hit first by someone two stages lower was no honor. He had won, yet the victory felt hollow.

Whispers drifted from the sidelines.

“He thinks he’s won?”

“Haha—challenged Yang Kai without knowing his reputation?”

“This will be fun.”

Zhou frowned. He truly knew little of Yang Kai—only the name. Passing by and seeing a crowd, he joined, then lucked into being chosen.

But hadn’t he already won? His punch had sent Yang Kai flying; by sect rules, the other should concede.

“Again!” The shout cut his thoughts.

Yang Kai had climbed up. Not a trace of discouragement—his fighting spirit burned hotter. Though his sallow face had paled from that blow, he charged once more.

Before Zhou could reply, Yang Kai closed in. Three feet away he suddenly sprang; both legs swept like whips at Zhou’s knees—Whip Kick.

Another basic technique every beginner learned, yet under Yang Kai’s execution, higher-ranked disciples watching felt they understood it anew.

So that’s how Whip Kick could be used.

A light smack sounded. Yang Kai flew again.

The two-stage gap in strength and physique left Yang Kai unable to match Zhou. That punch struck Yang Kai’s shin. When he stood again, his steps wobbled—bone likely bruised.

“Again!” Yang Kai’s eyes blazed like fire.

Thud—Yang Kai flew.

“Again!”

Thud—Yang Kai flew once more.

Some watchers left, unable to bear it. Others sighed: “Yang Kai’s toughness defies belief. Unless you knock him out, he never yields.”

Zhou heard and felt a pang. He had not expected such madness.

Yang Kai was knocked down seven or eight times. His face swelled; one eye blackened. He tottered like a leaf—but every time he fell, he rose, shouting and charging again.

Finally Zhou’s expression changed.  
“You’re insane! Keep this up and you’ll die!”
