## Chapter 272 — He Won't Refine Pills...

Once again, the entire army was annihilated.

Even a genius alchemist like Wang Qiren failed to pass Master Xiao's test, a result that greatly surprised everyone.

After Wang Qiren left in disappointment, the scene fell into silence for a long time, and no one dared to step onto the stage again.

No one had the confidence to pass the test set by Master Xiao, and they were too afraid to go up and embarrass themselves.

The people from Yao Wang Valley remained calm and collected, standing there waiting as no one stepped up.

Yang Kai glanced at Dong Qingyan and noticed her small hands tightly clenched and then released, clearly a sign of extreme nervousness. Her face showed a mix of eagerness and a hint of insecurity.

With Earth-Grade Upper-Level alchemists failing, could she, a Common-Grade Middle-Level, succeed?

"Some opportunities, if missed, may lead to lifelong regret!" Yang Kai said lightly.

Dong Qingyan trembled slightly, turned to look at Yang Kai, and a glimmer of contemplation flashed in her eyes. Soon, her gaze became resolute as she took a deep breath and said, "Okay, let's go up!"

Yang Kai smiled slightly, and together they leaped onto the high platform.

Seeing someone daring to step up, a wave of cheers erupted from below, encouraging shouts echoing, causing Dong Qingyan to smile shyly.

However, someone soon noticed the embroidery on her chest and realized her rank.

"She's just a Common-Grade Middle-Level alchemist..."

"With such a low rank, she’s probably going to embarrass herself again."

"Poor girl, if she makes a fool of herself now, how will she face others in the future?"

...

Dong Qingyan listened to these words, biting her red lip and remaining silent.

The three young disciples from Yao Wang Valley surprisingly smiled at her; a beautiful girl always garnered goodwill wherever she went.

"Miss, please!"

Dong Qingyan nodded gently, took a deep breath, and walked to the medicinal cauldron, reaching out to take a Poison Pill. She turned back to look at Yang Kai, her face filled with inquiry.

Yang Kai nodded lightly and said, "Don't worry, I'll watch from the side."

If Dong Qingyan really couldn't pass the test, he would certainly take her away; he couldn't let her embarrass herself in front of so many people.

On the high platform, apart from the disciples of Yao Wang Valley, there were only Dong Qingyan and Yang Kai. Yang Kai's attire clearly indicated he was her attendant, so the disciples of Yao Wang Valley did not immediately drive him away.

Dong Qingyan took a deep breath, placed the Poison Pill in her mouth, and resolutely swallowed it before sitting cross-legged to circulate her energy and neutralize the pill's effects.

Yang Kai stood with his hands behind his back, like a spear planted in place, vigilantly observing Dong Qingyan's movements.

Half a cup of tea passed, and she showed no reaction.

A full cup of tea passed, and she still had no reaction.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and secretly released his Divine Sense to scan Dong Qingyan, discovering that her Primordial Qi was flowing rapidly, refining some impurities within her meridians.

These impurities were likely the toxins contained in the Poison Pill.

"Hey, this girl is impressive; she has persisted for such a long time!" someone below exclaimed in surprise.

Among the hundreds who had stepped up before, apart from a few alchemists from major families, very few could last this long. Moreover, there had been Common-Grade alchemists who had come up before, but they could barely last a few breaths. Dong Qingyan's performance was indeed eye-opening.

"How did she do it? She is another talent suitable for alchemy. She is not inferior to Wang Qiren."

"I know her; she is Dong Qingyan, the young lady of the Dong Family!"

"What? The young lady of the Dong Family?"

As the crowd gasped, a faint black aura suddenly appeared between Dong Qingyan's brows. In an instant, this black aura grew dense, then rapidly moved, disappearing into her body. Instead, Dong Qingyan suddenly opened her mouth and expelled a visible black aura.

After expelling the aura, Dong Qingyan stared wide-eyed in astonishment.

Qin Ze suddenly stood up from his chair, his previously stern face finally breaking into a smile as he repeatedly praised, "Not bad, not bad. Finally, someone has passed Master Xiao's test!"

Passed?

The hundreds of people fell silent, hardly daring to believe it.

Over three hundred alchemists from all over the world had stepped up, including some exceptionally talented individuals and even Earth-Grade Upper-Level alchemists, yet all had failed miserably.

Now, a Common-Grade Middle-Level alchemist had passed without a scratch? What kind of mystery and wonder was hidden in this?

Dong Qingyan was also stunned, blinking her big eyes in disbelief at Qin Ze.

Yang Kai cleared his throat and said, "Miss, this senior says you have passed the master's test."

"Wh... what?" Dong Qingyan seemed still in a daze.

Qin Ze's previously cold demeanor changed, and he smiled warmly, "Miss, congratulations on passing the test! From now on, you will be a disciple of Master Xiao! Hmm... I should call you Junior Sister!"

Dong Qingyan was stunned for a long time.

Then she suddenly leaped up, overwhelmed with joy, covering her face with her hands as tears welled up in her eyes.

The happiness came too suddenly; the young girl clearly wasn't prepared for it.

After a moment of being at a loss for words, tears began to flow uncontrollably.

After fidgeting for a while, Dong Qingyan finally said to Qin Ze, "Ying'er pays respects to Senior Brother Qin!"

Qin Ze laughed heartily, "Junior Sister is polite! It is a blessing for our Yao Wang Valley that Master Xiao has accepted you as a disciple."

After some pleasantries, the atmosphere became much more harmonious, leaving the crowd below dumbfounded.

When had they ever seen Qin Ze from Yao Wang Valley be so friendly? Every time they sought him for alchemy, he always wore a stern face, as if everyone owed him money.

But now, he was smiling so widely.

It turned out he wasn't incapable of smiling; it was just that they had failed to catch his eye.

"Since Junior Sister has passed Master Xiao's test, you are now a disciple of Yao Wang Valley. If there’s nothing else, once this matter is settled, you can enter Yao Wang Valley with us. If there is something, please handle it early," Qin Ze said with a smile.

Dong Qingyan nodded. She needed to inform the Dong Family about joining Yao Wang Valley. However, at this point, she believed her brother would not obstruct her any longer.

Being able to enter Yao Wang Valley was also a matter of pride for the Dong Family. Just think about it; every force in the world wanted to have a good relationship with Yao Wang Valley, yet the young lady of the Dong Family had already become a direct disciple of Master Xiao. This was an unparalleled advantage that no one could compare to.

"Senior Brother, Ying'er wants her guard to try as well," Dong Qingyan said, glancing at Yang Kai.

"Guard?" Qin Ze frowned, casting a dismissive glance at Yang Kai. Though he didn't show much disgust, the disdain in his eyes was evident.

"This guard has protected me since I was little, so..."

Qin Ze looked at her meaningfully, clearly misunderstanding her feelings for Yang Kai.

He didn't delve deeper, merely nodding, "Since he wants to give it a try, it’s fine. After all, Master Xiao has plenty of Poison Pills."

After saying that, he casually asked, "What level of alchemist is he?"

Dong Qingyan blushed and said, "He won't refine pills..."

"Won't refine pills..." Qin Ze's expression immediately turned sour as he scolded, "What is he trying to test if he can't refine pills? Does he think alchemy is a joke? Our Yao Wang Valley is not so easy to enter. Without a heart for alchemy, how can he pass the test? It's better not to try."

Yang Kai looked at him calmly and said, "May I ask if Master Xiao mentioned that those without alchemy experience cannot participate in this test?"

Qin Ze scoffed, "Master Xiao never said that. But since you have never practiced alchemy before, you naturally won’t walk far down this path in the future. If you have no intention of dedicating your life to alchemy, don’t come here to make a fool of yourself; this is not a place for you to play."

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly as he said lightly, "As far as I know, Master Xiao himself only began practicing alchemy at the age of twenty-six or twenty-seven, and I am only seventeen this year, ten years younger than Master Xiao back then."

This information was something he had just overheard.

Qin Ze frowned, his expression quite displeased.

Suddenly, someone below shouted, "What are you? How dare you compare yourself to Master Xiao!"

"Master Xiao is a natural talent, born for alchemy. Even if he started practicing at twenty-six or fifty, it would not be late. What qualifications do you have to compare with the master?"

"Quiet!" Qin Ze shouted angrily, and the crowd immediately fell silent.

He stared at Yang Kai, remaining silent for a long time before finally nodding, "What you said has some merit. Since Master Xiao did not say that only alchemists can participate in the test, you are also qualified. Go and take a Poison Pill."

Yang Kai nodded and, amidst the cold laughter of the three disciples from Yao Wang Valley, took a Poison Pill and directly tossed it into his mouth.

Dong Qingyan watched him nervously, while Yang Kai smiled slightly and sat down nearby.

He activated the True Yang Technique, and a scorching sensation spread out. Qin Ze raised his eyebrows, secretly nodding in approval.

Although he had looked down on Yang Kai a bit earlier, feeling his True Essence now made him realize the youth was not simple. At such a young age, he had already reached the True Essence Realm; this level of talent was not something ordinary people could compare to. If he focused on martial arts instead of being distracted by alchemy, he would surely achieve great things in the future.

A mere guard was so impressive? The Dong Family had considerable depth, Qin Ze was genuinely surprised.

As soon as the Poison Pill entered his stomach, Yang Kai felt it dissolve completely, surging directly into his meridians.

Truly, it was a pill refined by a master; the effects were unleashed far too quickly. Even if Yang Kai was currently at the second layer of the True Essence Realm, even a martial artist who had just reached the Open Origin Realm could effortlessly absorb the effects as long as they circulated their Primordial Qi.

The effects flowed through his meridians, being refined and burned by his True Yang Primordial Qi, without harming himself in the slightest.

After circulating for several cycles, Yang Kai felt the toxins completely lose their potency, surging upwards, gathering into a turbid energy at the top of his head.

He froze for a moment, inwardly cursing.

Dong Qingyan had taken a cup of tea's time to pass the test, and Qin Ze had already shown signs of losing composure. If he passed the test after just a few cycles, it might cause quite a stir.

The speed was too fast!

Thinking of this, Yang Kai held the turbid energy in his mouth, refusing to spit it out, while continuing to circulate his technique nonchalantly.
