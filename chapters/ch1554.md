## Chapter 1554 — Xia Ningshang's Saint King Realm

Yang Kai glanced left and right. Meng Wuya seemed to know what he was searching for, chuckled, and volunteered, “Ningshang is in closed-door cultivation at a critical point and cannot be disturbed. Wait until she emerges. As for your Grandmaster, he does not live in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; he and your Yang Family and the people from Zhongdu have settled at the War Soul Hall a thousand li away.”

“Understood. I will go visit them myself later.” Yang Kai took a deep breath and steadyed his emotions.

Back then, when he brought friends and family from Zhongdu to the Tongxuan Continent, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land did not have enough room to accommodate them, so Yang Kai placed them at the War Soul Hall and the ruins of Poxuan Palace a thousand li away. Those two powers had once opposed Yang Kai, but in the end they were wiped out by him; their sects' foundations remained and conveniently became ready-made holdings for people from Zhongdu to take over.

Decades later, the people from Zhongdu had grown and prospered there. With the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's protection, that place had long been safe and peaceful, becoming a true hidden paradise.

Old acquaintances met each other, and the atmosphere was lively.

The Saint Lord's return to the sect was a monumental occasion for the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Everyone welcomed Yang Kai back to the main peak; Great Elder Xu Hui ordered a grand banquet to receive and toast the Saint Lord.

All the influential figures within the Sacred Land were present.

No one asked where Yang Kai had been for these decades or what he had done. Everyone only knew he had returned safely and was sitting before them — and that was enough.

The banquet was raucous; cups were passed, toasts exchanged. Even women like Li Rong and Han Fei drank until they were drunk.

This night was destined to be sleepless.

The feast began at sunset and lasted until dawn.

Most of those present had already crawled into their beds, except Xu Hui, who remained awake.

Yang Kai called him out.

“What does the Saint Lord command?” Xu Hui asked respectfully.

“How have the Hu sisters been these years?” Gazing at the long-missed sunrise over the Tongxuan Continent, Yang Kai asked casually.

“Replying to the Saint Lord: the Hu sisters have been safe. They have been diligently cultivating within the Twin Pavilion, carefully taught by Wu Fa and Wu Tian, and they have progressed very quickly. In recent years both sisters have entered the Saint Realm together, becoming the new stars of the Tongxuan Continent’s generation!”

“Hm.” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

The friends and family brought from Zhongdu were mostly placed in the War Soul Hall and the ruins of Poxuan Palace. Only the Hu sisters, having cultivated the Consonant Spirit Technique and inheriting the legacy of the Twin Pavilion’s founders, were taken by the current pavilion masters to the Twin Pavilion.

With the two sisters’ talents and the miraculous Consonant Spirit Technique, it was only natural that over these decades they would ascend into the Saint Realm.

This was still because the Tongxuan Continent’s Spiritual Qi was thin. If they had been placed on the Dark Star, their accomplishments would surely have far exceeded this.

They were absolutely capable of standing shoulder to shoulder with Qu Changfeng and Fang Tianzhong.

“Send word to Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er; have them come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.” Yang Kai ordered.

“Yes!” Xu Hui hurriedly replied, then his expression grew odd as he added, “If they learn the Saint Lord has returned to the sect, they will likely come rushing without an invitation.”

Yang Kai glanced at him; Xu Hui gave an awkward chuckle.

“Also send summons to the Great Lords of the yao race. Ask them to come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; tell them I have matters to discuss.”

“Yes, subordinate will do so. Saint Lord, is there anything else?”

“No, that is all. You may go.”

Xu Hui bowed and took his leave. He did not pry, he simply did his duties.

Glancing back at the wrecked palace, Yang Kai grinned, and with a flicker of his figure, appeared somewhere among the Nine Peaks.

It was a secret chamber. Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang was in closed-door cultivation inside. Standing outside the chamber, Yang Kai seemed to catch her scent and felt a rush of calm and delight.

He did not know what she was cultivating within, and he did not disturb her. He only sent out his Divine Sense to probe a little.

With his current formidable cultivation, such a silent probe was impossible for Xia Ningshang to detect.

He only meant to see whether Little Senior Sister was all right, but when his Divine Sense swept across where she lay his brows furrowed, and a look of astonished shock spread across his face.

Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang’s cultivation… was actually at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm!

How was that possible? Yang Kai almost thought his Divine Sense had erred.

He immediately probed more carefully, and no matter how he tried he found his previous reading had not been mistaken.

Little Senior Sister Xia Ningshang truly was at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm!

Yang Kai’s eyes showed stunned disbelief.

Although he was now at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, a full realm above Little Senior Sister, he had spent decades roaming the Star Domain and only achieved his current cultivation there under the nourishment of abundant Spiritual Qi.

Even if Little Senior Sister were blessed with innate talent, in a place as spiritually thin as the Tongxuan Continent she could not possibly have ascended to the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm; the Spiritual Qi here could not have supported such an advancement.

It could be said that such cultivation placed her far ahead of everyone on the Tongxuan Continent; if she wished, she could alone sweep across the entire continent.

Even the Great Demon God in former times had only reached the First Stage of the Saint King Realm; Little Senior Sister was unexpectedly a step above the Great Demon God.

How had she achieved this?

Yang Kai’s mind churned with doubts. Sometimes such surprises were not good omens.

He probed Xia Ningshang’s condition with even greater care.

Just then, Xia Ningshang’s Saint Yuan seemed to go awry, showing signs of losing control; her Saint Yuan stormed wildly through her meridians. She emitted unconscious murmurs, her pretty face contorted in pain — clearly suffering great agony.

“Qi deviation!” Yang Kai’s face darkened, and in an instant he was by Xia Ningshang’s side.

He reached out a hand to envelop her, and a vast, surging Saint Yuan burst forth with a roar.

Qi Deviation was an extremely dangerous condition. If it had been a cultivator of the same realm, Yang Kai wouldn’t have been able to help at all—any outside interference would only make the situation spiral further out of control.

Those fallen into qi deviation could only rely on their own resolute will to conquer the inner demons.

But he was a full realm above Xia Ningshang now, so it was no problem for him to intervene.

Under his guidance and regulation, the Saint Yuan within Xia Ningshang calmed, and the pain on her pretty face gradually subsided.

Yang Kai finally breathed out in relief.

The previously chaotic Saint Yuan smoothed out, and Xia Ningshang seemed to sense someone aiding her. Her long lashes trembled; her beautiful eyes opened a slit.

In the next moment, her eyes flashed with a mixture of joy and bewilderment.

She showed a sweet smile, reached out a delicate jade hand, touched Yang Kai’s cheek, and murmured, “Only in dreams can I meet you; may... the long dream never end, and may you remain by my side.”

She clearly thought she was dreaming.

Yang Kai felt an inexplicable ache in his heart, as if an invisible hand had gripped him, making it hard to breathe.

He opened his mouth but had no words.

When he had left the Tongxuan Continent in his youthful fervor — though it was to search for Su Yan — it had been a pain for Xia Ningshang as well.

She neither stopped nor tried to keep him—instead, she supported Yang Kai’s decision.

She had shown great magnanimity, allowing him to find Su Yan.

Over thirty years had passed since their parting; Su Yan still had not been found, yet Yang Kai had made Little Senior Sister endure more than thirty years of loneliness.

He felt guilty toward this understanding, gentle, and naive woman. His heart was full of remorse.

“Sleep now; sleep for a bit and you will be fine.” Yang Kai held Xia Ningshang and gently infused Saint Yuan into her to induce sleep.

Xia Ningshang’s eyes fluttered; her gaze was full of longing, as if unwilling to close, as if she wanted to open them once more and carefully look at the man before her.

Yet she could not resist Yang Kai’s measures and her eyes slowly shut. Her breathing steadied.

Yang Kai watched her; the tenderness in his eyes could soften a rock. He carefully laid her down, sent out his Divine Sense, and locked onto a certain spot within Xia Ningshang’s body.

In the next instant his face turned grim and he shouted, “Get out!”

With that he thrust his hand toward Xia Ningshang’s abdomen; a torrential Saint Yuan blasted into the void.

He grabbed and withdrew, extracting a murky, grayish aura from within Xia Ningshang.

The gray aura, once it left Xia Ningshang, hissed and struggled as if it had its own intelligence, striking left and right against Yang Kai’s hand in an attempt to break free.

Yang Kai’s expression hardened; he increased his Saint Yuan output. At the same time dozens of Golden Blood Threads shot forth, merged into a mass, and burst with dazzling golden light. When the light faded those dozens of Golden Blood Threads had interwoven into a great net, encasing that gray mist in the center.

Yang Kai stared coldly at it, his Divine Sense scanning within. He was eager to know what this thing truly was.

Earlier, when he had cleared Xia Ningshang’s meridians and Saint Yuan, he had inadvertently discovered this hidden gray aura inside her.

He had not acted immediately, but let Little Senior Sister fall into sleep before suddenly striking.

He did not know whether Xia Ningshang’s qi deviation had anything to do with this gray aura, but it was clearly not something she had cultivated herself; it was an alien thing, and for some reason it had attached itself to her body.

It did not appear to be a soul, for there were no signs Xia Ningshang had been usurped.

So what was it? Yang Kai frowned. Even with his experience and knowledge he could not tell what this gray aura truly was.

Hissing sounds grew loud; the gray aura drifted within the golden net like a beast trapped in a cage, unable to break free.

Suddenly Yang Kai’s brow lifted and an expression of surprise crossed his face.

From that gray aura he perceived Xia Ningshang’s life traces and the imprint of her spirit.

That meant Xia Ningshang knew of its presence and had once refined it.

Yet Yang Kai still felt that it wasn’t something good. There seemed to be a strange, inexplicable link between it and Little Senior Sister—one that made her, too, appear lifeless and dim, just like it.

This discovery made Yang Kai’s heart sink.

If his judgment was correct, then that gray mist and Little Senior Sister shared a life-linked connection—if one suffered, the other would too; if one prospered, so would the other. To rashly destroy it might very well cause Little Senior Sister to perish along with it.
