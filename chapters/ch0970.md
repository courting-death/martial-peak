## Chapter 970 — Each Displays Their Skill

The heavens changed color and a tidal maelstrom surged; at the front line, hundreds of Bone Race warriors were instantly blasted to powder by the might of countless Secret Treasures, leaving not a single corpse.

Even more Bone Race figures emerged thickly from the waves that had surged upward, recklessly charging toward the allied ranks of humans, yao, and demons without a hint of fear.

They used the sea's resistance and the deaths of their comrades to blunt the Secret Treasures' onslaught.

A chaotic melee was about to erupt; when those two to three thousand Bone Race members surged forward, the allied forces of humans, yao, and demons were instantly split apart and forced to form separate formations.

The Bone Race knew full well that today's battle would determine the course of the entire continent.

If they lost, they would surely be hunted to extinction and could no longer preserve even a trace of their bloodline as they had millennia ago. But if they won, they could mercilessly enslave the whole continent.

So Ke Luo threw everything into the fight, giving his race's full strength and disregarding his own losses.

Roars and screams split the sky in an instant, unceasing; people kept falling from the air as blood bloomed like the most gorgeous of flowers.

The Bone Race held an absolute numerical advantage; even after Yang Kai used the Soul-Devouring Worm to strike unexpectedly, they still outnumbered the experts of the human, yao, and demon alliance by two to three times.

They were not afraid of ordinary wounds; even if their hearts or heads were pierced, the flesh would quickly mend beneath the writhing bone—so long as their skeletal root remained intact, they were effectively undead.

But they had no Secret Treasures!

Perhaps when they once set foot on Tongxuan Continent thousands of years ago they had Secret Treasures. Yet over the millennia, deprived of nourishment from flesh and strength, their treasures had long since crumbled to powder and could no longer be used.

They could only fight using their own strength.

The humans, yao, and demons were different. Each hand held several decent Secret Treasures—offensive, defensive—an endless variety.

In terms of numbers of Saint Realm experts, they also outmatched the Bone Race.

With advantages on both sides, when this battle that would decide the continent's future broke out, it unexpectedly fell into a stalemate for a time.

Bone Race warriors were swiftly slain one after another; bones were broken, skeletal bodies burned, and they perished amid piercing screams.

The human, yao, and demon alliance suffered losses too, but compared to the Bone Race, their casualties were far fewer.

Each faction's experts displayed their prowess—methods and stratagems of every kind emerged.

A dense ink-black cloud hung in the sky like a shroud, as if the heavens had been stained with ink.

Not a ray of the sun could pierce that cloud; the entire sea surface was covered.

The world dimmed. The ink cloud pressed down like a falling mountain, its crushing weight collapsing like an avalanche of snow and bearing heavily on the Bone Race warriors, making their steps sluggish and their movements clumsy.

Beneath that ink cloud, Changyuan led a host of demon experts and formed a mighty force; as the cloud took shape, Changyuan struck first.

One by one, enormous pitch-black spheres of energy rolled down from the cloud like falling boulders and smashed into the Bone Race's formations.

Each of these energy spheres was as black as ink, rippling waves moving within them, containing world-destroying power.

When a black energy sphere struck the Bone Race ranks, a burst of eerie, soundless black light exploded out.

Ripples spread in all directions, sweeping over the bones of the Bone Race creatures.

The sea seemed to be split apart; vast chasms formed across the surface.

Even the island of the Water Divine Hall ten li away could not withstand such strange attacks; the isle split into fragments in an instant, and its buildings collapsed under the strain.

Crack—crack—crack...

Countless Bone Race members hit by the ripples were reduced to chunks of flesh in the next moment, as if sliced by razor edges—uncannily neat.

Transcendent Realm Bone Race members simply could not withstand such an assault.

Even those Saint Realm Bone Race experts were grievously wounded in an instant, nearly torn apart; had they not fled swiftly, they would have met the same fate.

Upon realizing Changyuan's ferocity, deep apprehension filled the emerald-green eyes of many.

The Four Great Demon Generals followed Changyuan, each face savage as overwhelming demonic qi surged skyward and, as if berserk, they charged into the Bone Race ranks and slaughtered freely.

Meng Wuya fought alone.

His hands pulled at the void in wild gestures, and a terrifying momentum radiated out from him.

No Bone Race expert dared approach him; sensing the might of his aura, they kept away at a distance.

As he pulled, strange energies gathered around him, gradually forming the shapes of savage giant beasts—colossal creatures that stood like pillars to the sky, each seeming ancient and desolate.

They appeared to awaken under a crushing weight; the moment their eyes opened, a calamity-like aura descended.

Heaven and earth trembled.

There were eight savage giant beasts in total—some running on land, some flying in the sky, even some swimming in the sea; all varieties were present.

They condensed into solid form like living demonic beasts and charged into the Bone Race ranks, opening their jaws to swallow Bone Race members whole, bones and all.

Chu Lingxiao led Cang Yan and three others to precisely locate a Bone Race Saint Realm expert of the Third Stage; with the five of them combined they sought only to kill him quickly.

The Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon, Earth-Splitting Divine Ox, and Ice-Jade Python, three Great Yao Lords, no longer held back; they each took form and led yao experts in a rampage.

The Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon spewed forth scorching waves of fire, and wherever they passed, members of the Bone Race melted into puddles of bone water. Arcs of lightning still crackled around his body, and bolts thicker than a man’s torso were drawn down from the heavens by his power. Their might was boundless—when they struck the Bone Race experts, their bodies convulsed, unable to resist in the slightest, and they were slain on the spot.

Where the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox passed, the ground cracked and deep fissures hundreds of zhang deep appeared; from those cracks surged a dense earth aura like a giant vortex that dragged Bone Race creatures in and crushed them into pulp as the rifts closed.

The Ice-Jade Python's body gleamed like translucent white jade, her flesh defense extraordinarily strong; Bone Race's attacks struck only to produce a few sparks and could not harm her in the least.

Her tail lashed; no Bone Race being could withstand a single strike—flesh and blood scattered and bones broke apart.

Within the Ancient Demon Clan, Li Rong's figure flickered and she reached out with graceful jade hands to reap the creatures' lives with elegant motions.

Han Fei, wrapped in a chill that trailed her on the field, turned earth to frozen soil and sent snow falling from the skies; brilliant ice flowers formed on the chests of Bone Race creatures and froze them into sculptures before shattering them to pieces.

No expert among the human, yao, and demon alliance held back; at this moment they each displayed their full might and expended every effort.

They counted not their own losses but only sought to exterminate those extraterrestrial invaders as quickly as possible.

They had been stirred by Yang Kai's earlier lone charge into the enemy lines.

Yang Kai was only at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, yet he had charged alone into those three thousand Bone Race creatures and, in an instant, slaughtered several hundred of them.

They refused to show weakness.

Before departing, Yang Kai had been appointed by the three races to issue commands, but he would not boss others around nor did he wish to.

He did not speak but instead stirred the three races' fighting spirit with his actions.

He caused them to temporarily abandon racial boundaries and join forces to seek a way to survive on this continent.

Everyone fought desperately, and Yang Kai was no exception.

The effectiveness of a Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm cultivator in such chaotic fighting was truly limited; every Bone Race member was at Transcendent Realm and exceedingly troublesome, and Yang Kai, struggling, used the Nine Heavens Divine Technique to slay fewer than ten enemies.

A trace of impatience rose in his heart as Yang Kai swiftly condensed the scorching True Yuan within his body.

The golden dragon pattern on his back stirred in places invisible to the naked eye, as if endowed with life and crawling across his frame.

In the next moment, dazzling golden light exploded from that dragon pattern, dazzling every eye.

A presence of authority, as solid as substance, erupted.

A high, resounding dragon cry pierced the heavens like a sword and rang through the world.

A huge golden dragon suddenly roared into the sky from a spot on the battlefield—a sunlike being of radiance, its searing power gathered and burned every Bone Race creature that approached.

In the blink of an eye, four or five Transcendent Realm experts of the Bone Race were burned to ashes.

"The might of the Dragon Emperor!" Chen Zhou, Palace Master of Dragon-Phoenix Palace, drew breath and stared transfixed at the golden dragon soaring and slaughtering Bone Race members in midair, a flush of excitement rising on his face as he cried, "The Dragon Emperor's might returns to our Dragon-Phoenix Palace!"

Even after so many years, Chen Zhou still remembered that deja vu-like scene. On that day, the Youhan Grotto-Heaven launched a massive invasion near the Dragon-Phoenix Palace, and just as the Sect was struggling to hold out, the might of the Dragon Emperor manifested, effortlessly cutting down the enemy and saving the fate of the Dragon-Phoenix Palace.

And today, on this battlefield against extraterrestrial invaders, the Dragon Emperor's might had manifested once more.

"Xiao Ling!" Chen Zhou barked angrily after his initial thrill.

"Palace Master!" Elder Xiao Ling, fighting beside Chen Zhou, rushed over at the call.

"Has Sun Yu arrived?" Chen Zhou asked anxiously.

"No. Lord Dragon Emperor's strength is insufficient this time; he did not come."

"Then how is this possible?" Chen Zhou stared at the huge golden dragon in astonishment.

If Sun Yu, the Dragon Emperor of Dragon-Phoenix Palace, had not come, how could the image of the Dragon Emperor appear here?

He was baffled and could not make sense of it.

"The aura of a True Dragon!"

At the same time, Lei Long, the Great Lord, paused mid-action and stared at the golden dragon, exclaiming in shock.

He too had a dragon body now, though it was the Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon; compared to that golden dragon, both in size and the purity of its yao qi, it was far inferior.

That golden dragon gave off the most authentic scent of a sovereign among yao.

For a moment, tumult rolled through Lei Long's mind; he had not expected to feel such an aura in the world at this time.

Even the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox and the Ice-Jade Python fell silent and, with solemn expressions, looked at the golden dragon with reverence and longing.

At that moment, many yao experts, as if injected with adrenaline, took their forms and howled, crazed, and rampaged through the Bone Race.

The aura of the True Dragon raised the yao's spirits to a fever pitch.
