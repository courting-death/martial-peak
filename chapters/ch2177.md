## Chapter 2177 — Golden Cicada Shell Escape

These four people were clearly also active nearby, drawn here by the phenomenon caused by the emergence of the Supreme Mystery Treasure Lotus.

Among them, one was a burly man whose very presence exuded authority; he was unmistakably at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Another was a short-haired youth, his eyes shifty as if plotting mischief at any moment, his cultivation neither high nor low—just the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. The remaining pair, a man and a woman, appeared to be companions: the woman was petite and delicate, the man suave and handsome; their closeness made it obvious they were fellow disciples with an excellent relationship. Both were also at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

At this moment, all four wore expressions of astonishment, their gazes fixed unblinkingly on the Supreme Mystery Treasure Lotus, greed flickering in their eyes.

Seeing this, Yang Kai could not help but let out a long sigh.

Although he had mentally prepared himself, knowing that the phenomenon caused by the emergence of the Supreme Mystery Treasure Lotus would surely attract many cultivators, he had not expected people to arrive so quickly.

And four at once, no less…

It seemed there were indeed quite a few cultivators active on this plain, otherwise they would not have arrived so swiftly.

“Senior Brother… what kind of Spiritual Medicine is this?” After observing for a moment, the woman dressed as a young matron softly asked the man beside her. She did not recognize the type of Spiritual Medicine before her, only that it was something extraordinary.

The Senior Brother slowly shook his head and said, “I don’t know either.”

As he spoke, he licked his dry lips, eager to act, but his gaze kept darting toward the burly man—clearly wary. After all, the other’s cultivation was the highest here; if it came to seizing the Spiritual Medicine, he would be the greatest threat.

“Brother Cheng Tai, do you recognize what this Spiritual Medicine is?” At that moment, the short-haired youth suddenly addressed the burly man, as if the two were already acquainted.

“No idea.” The man called Cheng Tai replied in a deep, muffled voice, casting a sidelong glance at the short-haired youth. “Brother Bao, you can’t recognize it either?”

Bao Peng smiled and said, “If even Brother Cheng Tai doesn’t know, how could I? You give me too much credit.”

“Hmph.” Cheng Tai snorted coldly, then turned to look at the man and woman. He called out loudly, “You two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, do you recognize it?”

The Senior Brother frowned at the question and slowly shook his head, as did the woman.

Only then did Cheng Tai turn his gaze to Yang Kai, shouting, “Hey kid, you seem to be the first one here? What’s the deal with this Spiritual Medicine? Speak up.”

“I… I don’t know.” Yang Kai looked flustered and stammered, “I was just drawn here by the phenomenon…”

“What a bunch of useless trash!” Cheng Tai couldn’t help but curse before Yang Kai finished. “You all came running over, yet not a single one of you can recognize a Spiritual Medicine!”

With that, he managed to insult everyone present.

The Senior Brother and the woman from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect both frowned at his words, clearly displeased, while Bao Peng, seemingly well aware of Cheng Tai’s temperament, didn’t mind at all.

At this moment, Cheng Tai said, “No matter what this Spiritual Medicine is, I want it. If you want to live, get lost now. Otherwise, don’t blame me for showing no mercy!”

Bao Peng raised his eyebrows at this, smiling faintly. “Brother Cheng, isn’t that a bit much?”

“You have a problem with that?” Cheng Tai’s face turned grim as he looked at the short-haired youth, snorting coldly. “If you have something to say, say it boldly. Bear the consequences yourself!”

The latter quickly raised his hands and retreated a few steps, saying repeatedly, “Brother Cheng Tai, you misunderstand. If you want this thing, how could I object? But I’m afraid those two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect won’t agree so easily. After all, Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects belong to those fated.…”

Hearing this, that Senior Brother nodded solemnly. “That’s right. Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects belong to those fated. If you want it, friend, you’ll have to prove you have the ability!”

Although Cheng Tai was a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert, he and his Junior Sister were two people! So he wasn’t particularly afraid of him. Besides, with such a rare treasure right before them, there was no way he would give it up easily.

“So you two want to test my skills?” Cheng Tai grinned at these words, his smile full of menace. “I’ve long heard that the Flowing Shadow Sword Sect’s technique is ghostly and unpredictable. I wonder if that’s true… Today’s the perfect chance. Let me see your skills.”

As he spoke, Origin Qi surged over Cheng Tai’s body. His already burly frame suddenly swelled, and a shocking pressure spread out.

He continued, “Don’t disappoint me, you two!”

With that, he stomped his feet on the ground, splitting the very space beneath him. Like a meteor falling from the sky, he charged at the two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect with terrifying force.

He actually attacked directly!

“Careful!” Senior Brother shouted in a low voice. Spinning and twisting, he left behind layers of afterimages and, together with the woman, flew more than ten zhang away.

Swish, swish…

Two soft sounds, accompanied by flashes of cold light.

Swords were drawn, radiating a chilling killing intent.

The Senior Brother and the woman each held a sword in one hand and formed seals with the other, striking strange poses. Suddenly, fierce sword energy burst in all directions.

“There’s a limit to how much you can look down on people!” Senior Brother shouted angrily. The other party had attacked them after just a few words, which infuriated him. Murderous intent filled his eyes as he called to the woman, “Junior Sister, don’t hold back!”

“Don’t worry, Junior Sister will let him fully experience the might of the Flowing Shadow Sword Technique.” The woman laughed softly, her sword suddenly weaving streaks of light as she slashed at Cheng Tai.

At the same time, Senior Brother also unleashed all his skills, joining forces with his Junior Sister. Every move was aimed to kill.

Cheng Tai, after all, was a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert. He remained calm in the face of danger, his arms sweeping wide to stir up a storm of energy, fighting two at once without falling behind in the slightest.

In an instant, the three were locked in fierce battle atop the mountain, sword energy flying, energy raging, the battlefield a whirlwind of flying sand and stones—a truly spectacular scene.

And the one who started all this—Bao Peng—stood quietly on the sidelines, showing no intention of intervening. From time to time, a thoughtful look would flash across his face, as if he was gaining insight from watching the fight.

“Sigh…” Suddenly, Yang Kai let out a sigh, turning to look at a certain spot. “This Spiritual Medicine doesn’t look ripe yet. Harvesting it rashly… isn’t a good idea. If its medicinal properties are ruined…”

But where he looked, there was no one at all.

The three locked in battle were startled by his words, immediately stopping and withdrawing from the fight, looking at Yang Kai in shock and suspicion.

Cheng Tai, in particular, frowned deeply and glanced at Bao Peng, who was standing not far away.

“I already said, don’t harvest it rashly… Can’t you understand human speech?” Yang Kai shouted again, throwing a punch at a certain spot.

As energy surged, a figure suddenly appeared, ghost-like, from the empty space, his face filled with shock. He was less than ten zhang from the Supreme Mystery Treasure Lotus, and judging by his sneaky approach, he clearly intended to steal the Spiritual Medicine while everyone was distracted.

“Bao Peng!” When Cheng Tai saw the man’s face clearly, he couldn’t help but roar in anger.

But at that moment, the other Bao Peng, who had been standing on the sidelines, suddenly turned into a stream of light and vanished!

It had been an incredibly lifelike afterimage…

The real Bao Peng had long since used some secret technique to sneak elsewhere.

“You…” Bao Peng, forced out by Yang Kai’s attack, flew into a rage, glaring fiercely at Yang Kai. “Brat, you’re courting death!”

In his view, if Yang Kai hadn’t interfered, he would have already taken the Spiritual Medicine and escaped. But because of Yang Kai, his plan had failed at the last moment.

Frustrated, he naturally flew into a rage!

“Sorry…” Yang Kai scratched his head helplessly. “If possible, I wouldn’t have exposed you either, but your actions… are just too much to tolerate, truly despicable!”

He spat in contempt.

To others, his words might have sounded like something else, but what Yang Kai truly meant was that such actions would ruin the Supreme Mystery Treasure Lotus.

The Supreme Mystery Treasure Lotus was still far from maturity. How could Yang Kai allow it to be recklessly picked? His earlier act of playing dumb was just to buy time. But now, it seemed that plan wouldn’t work.

“That’s right!” Cheng Tai shouted. “After all these years, Bao Peng, you’re still so despicable! Even though I was already being extremely careful, I still almost fell for your trick!”

Although he had been fighting the two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect, Cheng Tai hadn’t been going all out. He had kept part of his attention on Bao Peng, but seeing him standing still, he had felt at ease.

Who would have thought that the Bao Peng standing there was just an illusion!

The two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect didn’t look too pleased either, but more than that, they were curious. Among everyone present, no one had noticed Bao Peng’s trick—except Yang Kai…

If they hadn’t clearly sensed that Yang Kai’s cultivation was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, they might have thought it was an illusion.

“Calm down, Brother Cheng…” Bao Peng quickly gave Cheng Tai a flattering look and said with an awkward smile, “It’s not like I succeeded. I was exposed before I could get away…”

“That’s just bad luck!” Cheng Tai snorted. “If you’d been luckier, you’d be running off with the Spiritual Medicine right now, wouldn’t you?”

“It’s not just luck…” Bao Peng stared deeply at Yang Kai and said coldly, “What I just used was my Five Aggregates Sect’s secret technique—Golden Cicada Shell Escape. Even an expert a whole Stage higher would never see through it. It’s always been the perfect technique for escaping with one’s life…”

“So it was the Golden Cicada Shell Escape!” Cheng Tai exclaimed in a low voice, clearly having heard of the technique’s reputation. He looked at Bao Peng with a complicated expression. “I didn’t expect Sect Master Qin would actually teach you such a secret art!”

"That’s not important." Bao Peng still stared straight at Yang Kai, his voice cold. "I’m just very curious—how did a piece of trash like you, at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, see through my movements?"
