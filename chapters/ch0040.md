## Chapter 40 — You Are Truly Formidable

The fierce battle raged on relentlessly. Disciples of Fengyu Tower continued to fall one after another, yet with each opponent Yang Kai struck down, a fresh wound appeared on his body. By now, his clothes were soaked in blood, his breath ragged and heavy. Veins bulged on his neck, and his eyes burned red like a ravenous beast seeking prey.

Su Mu lay exhausted on the ground, helplessly watching Yang Kai unleash his might, felling disciple after disciple from Fengyu Tower. His heart was a tangled mess of emotions. This entire ordeal was his doing; Yang Kai was his enemy, yet it was thanks to him that Su Mu had survived.

He wished to help, but his body was utterly drained. The fierce beating he had taken from Cheng Shaofeng had nearly robbed him of all fighting strength.

With a sharp thud, the last Fengyu Tower disciple collapsed to the ground, howling in agony. The invasion of True Yang Primordial Qi made his entire body feel as if it were ablaze, unbearable pain searing through him.

Yang Kai’s bloodshot eyes flicked toward the stunned Cheng Shaofeng, a cold smile curling at the corner of his lips.

Cheng Shaofeng’s heart skipped a beat. Yang Kai’s ferocity sent a chill through him. Now that Yang Kai’s gaze was fixed on him, he instinctively took two steps back.

Hu Mei’er let out a disdainful laugh.

That laugh caused Cheng Shaofeng’s pride to falter. Regaining his composure, he coldly appraised Yang Kai and slowly said, “I didn’t expect you to possess such skill.”

Yang Kai advanced step by step, his footsteps steady. His lean figure pressed forward like a wild storm bearing down.

Cheng Shaofeng’s breathing grew faintly rapid, his expression darkening. Suddenly, he shouted, “You’re courting death! Don’t blame me!”

With that, he drew the sword at his waist. Earlier, when dealing with Su Mu and the others, he had refrained from using his weapon, unwilling to cause a fatality. Even throwing stones at Su Mu was a rash act, driven by a surge of anger without much thought for consequences. But now, unarmed, Cheng Shaofeng felt uncertain.

This Lingxiao Pavilion disciple, drenched in blood, was terrifyingly ruthless.

“Be careful, this man is already at the Open Origin Realm,” Su Mu warned reluctantly.

“Open Origin Realm…” Yang Kai murmured, halting his steps.

Cheng Shaofeng’s expression brightened with delight and arrogance. He laughed loudly, “Boy, you’re only at the Body Tempering Realm. How could you possibly be my match? You’ve used so much Primordial Qi; it will take months to recover. If you keep fighting, you’ll damage your foundation and never rise again. Kneel and beg for mercy, and I might…”

Before he could finish, Yang Kai charged forward like a gale.

“You…” Cheng Shaofeng was shocked. Was this man a fool? Knowing he was Open Origin Realm and still rushing headlong?

Though startled, Cheng Shaofeng did not hesitate. His sword flashed forward, aiming at Yang Kai.

Facing the oncoming sword, Yang Kai performed an unexpected move. He stretched out a large hand and grasped directly at the blade.

Though the sword was only Common-Grade, it was still a sharp weapon. How could flesh withstand its edge?

Cheng Shaofeng’s face lit up with satisfaction, thinking Yang Kai was courting death. The sword’s speed increased, stabbing toward Yang Kai’s palm.

With a “puff,” the sword pierced through Yang Kai’s hand, blood spurting forth.

Hu Mei’er’s expression flickered with surprise. She had thought Yang Kai possessed some extraordinary technique to boldly face Cheng Shaofeng. Yet now, seeing him so easily impaled, she felt disappointed.

So this man was nothing special—just foolish!

Before her thoughts could finish, a sudden change occurred. Despite his hand being pierced, Yang Kai did not retreat. Instead, he closed the distance to Cheng Shaofeng even faster.

In the blink of an eye, they were face to face. The sound of sword scraping flesh sent chills deep into the hearts of onlookers.

With a sharp slap, Yang Kai’s wounded hand seized Cheng Shaofeng’s sword-wielding hand, the back of his hand pierced through by the entire blade.

Staring at the frenzied Yang Kai, Cheng Shaofeng could no longer hide his fear. He tried to pull back his sword with force, but Yang Kai’s grip was like iron, immovable.

Yang Kai sneered fiercely, his blood-red eyes gleaming with a bloodthirsty light. He raised his crimson fist and smashed it toward Cheng Shaofeng’s face.

In panic, Cheng Shaofeng raised his hand to block, hastily mobilizing his Primordial Qi for defense.

But Cheng Shaofeng had only recently ascended to the Open Origin Realm. How much Primordial Qi could he truly muster? Yang Kai’s fist struck his right cheek with brutal force. A tooth flew out on impact, and the cheek instantly swelled, reddened as if scalded by boiling water.

Such overwhelming Primordial Qi! Cheng Shaofeng was finally terrified. Despite his realm, he could not withstand this fiery assault. His head spun dizzily.

In a daze, Yang Kai’s second punch landed. Cheng Shaofeng’s mind blurred.

Another punch followed. His body weakened, and he half-kneeling before Yang Kai, his head bowed, eyes vacant.

Yang Kai swept his leg and kicked him flying.

Silence fell over the battlefield. Hu Mei’er was utterly shocked. This man was not foolish at all. His bold move to grab the sword had a deeper purpose: only by seizing it could he prevent Cheng Shaofeng from dodging.

All Fengyu Tower disciples, including the Open Origin Realm Cheng Shaofeng, were utterly defeated.

Yang Kai turned to Hu Mei’er. Under his blood-red gaze, she shivered involuntarily.

She had never seen anyone so ruthless at the Body Tempering Realm. Even the talented youths of the Blood Battle Gang could not compare.

A series of sharp, grating sounds followed as Yang Kai slowly withdrew the sword from his palm, warm blood dripping.

Throughout the entire process, he did not even furrow his brow. Tossing the sword aside, he steadily approached Hu Mei’er.

The coquettish young woman nervously swallowed, forcing a dry smile.

No sooner had her smile blossomed than Yang Kai swiftly closed the distance. His bloodied hand grabbed her slender, fair neck and violently threw her to the ground.

Her delicate body struck the earth with a muffled thud. A heated moan escaped her throat, stirring the imagination.

Yang Kai bent over her, smiling softly as he gazed into her eyes.

Hu Mei’er’s heart pounded wildly. She hurried to explain, “I’m not allied with them. I belong to the Blood Battle Gang. I didn’t attack any Lingxiao Pavilion disciples.”

“Is that so?” Yang Kai’s smile deepened with meaning.

“Yes.” Hu Mei’er relaxed slightly, sensing he was willing to communicate. Though a woman and weaker than Cheng Shaofeng, she possessed an advantage others lacked.

Her body.

“You are… truly formidable,” Hu Mei’er said, emboldened. She reached out a delicate hand, touching Yang Kai’s chest. When she withdrew it, blood stained her fingers. Without hesitation, she brought her fingers to her lips and sucked on them.

Immediately, a stunning beauty bloomed on her ruby lips. Her bewitching eyes gleamed with a strange light, captivating and intoxicating.
