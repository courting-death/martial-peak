## Chapter 1200 — Saint Crystal Vein

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai didn't immediately reply; instead he showed a hesitant look, rubbing his chin and pondering for a long while. Just as Shen Shitao secretly fretted, fearing Yang Kai would refuse, he finally spoke: "I don't mind going down first to scout, but how will any gains be divided?"

"Don't worry, little brother. We're not the Battle Sky Alliance, we don't act so overbearing. Whatever benefits are inside, we'll divide them per head. Look, there are seven of us here — we'll split things into seven shares and each take one. How does that sound?"

This method of division might look like a windfall for the Qiantian Sect since they have greater numbers and will take more, but in truth it's quite fair!

After all, the other side has five Saint Kings and several at the second or third Stage; if these had been Battle Sky Alliance cultivators, they'd have driven Yang Kai and Chang Qi away or even slain them, so who would they share with? That Shen Shitao proposed such terms was already exceedingly just.

They just didn't know that if anyone actually dared to move to drive others off, they'd be the ones to lose out.

"Then what if there's not enough to split into seven shares?" Yang Kai asked, posing a sharp question.

"That's easy. If there's not enough for seven shares, we'll auction off what we find — highest bid wins. That way, those with funds get the treasures, those without will split Saint Crystals. We usually handle things that way when adventuring outside." Shen Shitao was clearly seasoned in such matters and immediately laid out a plan that satisfied Yang Kai.

With such sincerity, Yang Kai naturally had no more objections and nodded at once. "Fine. Then as you say — I'll go down first and lead. I'm young and strong, not afraid of danger, so it's no problem for me to go ahead, but this Guest Elder Chang is advanced in years..."

"I'll bring up the rear; how about the old gentleman walks in front of me?" Shen Shitao smiled faintly — she knew what Yang Kai was worried about and readily accepted part of the risk.

"Good." Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction, compelled to admit that this beauty named Shen Shitao was adept at handling affairs. She seemed the sort to weigh others' risks and concerns and to put herself in their shoes — no wonder the other four men and women deferred to her so completely.

This made Yang Kai feel a certain affection toward her; people like that were scarce these days.

He guessed Shen Shitao likely had some renown within Qiantian Sect — probably a Core Disciple or some similar figure.

After the arrangements, Yang Kai wasted no time; he took the lead and leapt into the shaft.

This left Shen Shitao, who had meant to give him a last word of warning, stunned on the spot; by the time she found her voice, Yang Kai was gone.

"..." The five from Qiantian Sect all looked at one another, their expressions odd.

By now they were increasingly certain Yang Kai was a man of great fortune — he acted so rashly and hot-bloodedly, plunging into an unknown shaft without taking out a defensive Secret Treasure to shield himself, and at the very least he could have activated his Saint Yuan to guard his body, couldn't he?

Yet he had simply jumped straight down.

If he weren't a man of great luck, with his manner of acting he would likely have died countless times along the way; there would be no way he could still be alive.

"Ahem, let's follow." Chang Qi, seeing the five frozen in place, couldn't help but remind them; if Yang Kai really encountered danger below, it would be improper for them to just stand above.

"Let's go..." Shen Shitao nodded helplessly. The other four from Qiantian Sect immediately circulated their Saint Yuan and one by one jumped into the shaft. After they went in, Chang Qi followed closely, and Shen Shitao herself truly brought up the rear.

The shaft was very deep. After Yang Kai dropped in, he kept sliding downward; the passage seemed naturally formed, its walls smooth as jade, requiring no effort — he slid down quite easily.

Although Yang Kai didn't deploy a defensive Secret Treasure nor activate his Saint Yuan to guard himself, his Divine Sense remained vigilant toward what lay below; if danger came, he'd make his defenses at once.

To his surprise, there wasn't a hint of danger in the shaft. He slid for the span of half an incense stick and estimated he'd descended at least three or four hundred zhang underground, yet remained safe the whole way.

Suddenly, an extraordinarily pure energy shot up from below. Yang Kai's spirit jolted and his face displayed a look of incredulity.

The intensity of that energy was even purer and thicker than the spiritual fluid's scent in the Stalactite Cave; such a concentrated aura clearly meant something valuable lay below.

After sliding another hundred zhang or so, Yang Kai finally stepped onto solid ground. He swayed slightly, moved out of the way to give space to those behind, and took a lightstone from his ring to illuminate the place.

A soft glow emanated. With the lightstone's radiance, Yang Kai made out his position: an underground cavern with a subterranean stream flowing not far off, its water clear to the bottom.

The cavern wasn't large — only a few dozen zhang across — and around it were passages branching in every direction, leading into unknown depths.

From every passage there poured an extraordinarily thick flow of Spiritual Qi.

Yang Kai looked around, and when he saw the mouth of one passage his eyes suddenly brightened.

He discovered a faint trace at that passage mouth, exactly the same as what he'd seen when pursuing that little snake-shaped Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object before. Though the scent was very slight and faded quickly, it was undoubtedly the trail it had left.

It had really hidden in here.

Yang Kai did not rush to search; he stood where he was and waited.

After a moment, the five from Qiantian Sect and Chang Qi arrived one after another. Upon seeing the cavern's oddity and the dense Spiritual Qi, they were filled with joy and showed extreme excitement.

"Senior Sister Shen, what place is this? What good things might be inside?" another female cultivator in the group couldn't restrain her delight and hurriedly asked Shen Shitao.

"How would I know? This young brother went down first — did you find anything special?" Shen Shitao cast her gaze at Yang Kai.

"No." Yang Kai shook his head. "I came down and waited here for you."

Chang Qi frowned beside him, as if something had come to mind; his expression shifted.

Shen Shitao read his expression and could not help turning her lovely eyes toward him. "Old sir, did you find something? If you have any insight, please instruct us."

Chang Qi chuckled. "You flatter me, young lady — I'm no one to instruct. But if this old man isn't mistaken, this place should be a mineral vein!"

"A vein?" Shen Shitao and the others all exclaimed in surprise.

"A Saint Crystal vein!" Chang Qi's voice dropped as he uttered the four words that made hearts race, then added, "And a rich vein at that!"

"Is it really a Saint Crystal vein?" Excitement shimmered in Shen Shitao's eyes; the other four men and women were equally agitated, each unable to contain their thrill.

"I can't promise for certain, but I'm at least eighty percent sure," Chang Qi smiled faintly. "I once mined Saint Crystals for Yingyue Hall, so I'm somewhat familiar with places like this. As for absolute certainty, a quick inspection will tell."

Everyone agreed and decided to investigate. The cavern had many passages; Yang Kai still led the way, deliberately choosing an inconspicuous entrance to go in.

Less than thirty zhang in, Yang Kai halted and stared in astonishment at the scene before him. Even having faced great trials and possessing over a hundred million Saint Crystals, he was shocked by what he saw.

Before him lay an enormous, intact Saint Crystal ore block, uncut and as large as several houses, plugging the passage. From its color, the impurities within, and the Spiritual Qi fluctuations it gave off, it was undoubtedly an Upper-Level Saint Crystal!

And deeper inside, who knew how many equally colossal Saint Crystals there were.

From behind Yang Kai came the sound of throat-clearing and swallowing — gulp after gulp, incessant.

On Dark Star, Saint Crystal ore veins were scarce. Those great forces and major sects might have appeared lavish and unrestrained at the Jubao Tower auctions, but that was only because of their deep foundations and years of accumulation. Moreover, with the opening of the Flowing Flame Sandland drawing near at the time, none of them minded spending a few extra Saint Crystals to purchase protective treasures for their disciples, so they could obtain as many benefits as possible once inside.

It was an investment: so long as those disciples could make use of the purchased items, whatever gains they secured in Flowing Flame Sandland would more than make up for the Saint Crystals spent.

Yet however lavish they were, it couldn't conceal the scarcity of Saint Crystal veins on this cultivation star.

Qiantian Sect counted as a major sect, not one bit inferior to Yingyue Hall. Shen Shitao had heard that the sect controlled a dozen or so veins of varying sizes; only two were Upper-Level Saint Crystal veins, the rest being Middle- or Lower-Level.

And none of them matched the reputed rich veins — their Saint Crystal yields fell far short of the standard for a rich vein.

What is a rich vein? A rich vein is exactly what lay before them: Saint Crystals visible at a glance. That is a rich vein!

So upon seeing this gigantic Upper-Level Saint Crystal exposed in the open, Shen Shitao could not suppress the surge of excitement in her heart.

If this entire vein were mined, it would surely lift Qiantian Sect's coffers to a new tier.

How had Flowing Flame Sandland been hiding such an envy-inducing vein all this time — how had earlier visitors never discovered it?

"Then there's no need to divide it, right?" Yang Kai suddenly turned and asked bluntly, snapping Shen Shitao back from her astonishment.

"No need, no need. Although we haven't checked the other passages, they should be similar. Let's each mine our own — whatever we extract will be ours," Shen Shitao hastily waved her hand.

Flowing Flame Sandland had only been open for a bit over a month, with about five months left before the final cutoff. If they lingered here that long mining Saint Crystals...
