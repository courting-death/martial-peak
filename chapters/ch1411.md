## Chapter 1411 — Spiritual Qi

The woman surnamed Ye’s pride and methods were something Qian Tong and the others had experienced firsthand in their youth. As the former Sect Master of Star Emperor Mountain, she had already been one of the foremost experts of her era. Having remained in seclusion for over a hundred years, her cultivation had likely reached the realm of perfect mastery. On all of Dark Star, there were surely only a handful capable of facing her in single combat.

She barked orders at people like them, yet treated this junior, Yang Kai, with a gentleness of expression — was this for real?

Qian Tong and the others were struck by an unreal feeling.

It seemed they had also noticed Yang Kai’s unease. The woman surnamed Ye did not press the matter; after a brief thought she spoke, “Very well. I will not force you to open the grand formation. Could you let me speak a few words to that girl called Yang Yan? I bear you no ill will — I have come only to confirm one matter.”

Of course she wanted Yang Yan! Yang Kai looked up at her and nodded slightly, “If it’s only a few words, that’s no problem. Please take it, Elder.”

Saying so, he brushed his hand across his Spatial Ring, produced a Transmission Compass and tossed it toward her. The woman surnamed Ye made no move, yet the compass flew straight to her and she caught it gently in her hand.

Then, in full view of everyone, she closed her beautiful eyes and poured Divine Sense into the Transmission Compass, beginning to communicate with Yang Yan who remained in the mountain’s interior.

Time passed slowly. Everyone present, regardless of cultivation or rank, did not dare to draw a breath as if they feared disturbing this woman surnamed Ye.

As time passed, the woman’s delicate body trembled slightly. Her expression flickered from shock and confusion to fear and unease, then to joy and excitement. An unstoppable, tsunami-like momentum surged outward from her slender frame.

All the Saint King Realm warriors trembled; under that might they felt as if they hovered on the threshold of the underworld, certain that with a single thought from the woman they would fall in the next moment.

Those at the First or Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm had to exert their strength to resist. Only the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts were not affected, though they too were secretly shaken.

They were indeed of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the same realm as the woman surnamed Ye, yet not one of them could reach the degree she had attained.

This was clearly a sign that her Shi had already been perfected! In other words, if she were not suppressed by Dark Star’s heavenly laws, the woman surnamed Ye would very likely already be at the Void King Realm level.

For those of the Origin Returning Realm to ascend to the Void King Realm, one’s Shi must be consummate — a fact none of those present had satisfied.

Sensing the gap between themselves and the woman surnamed Ye, everyone’s hearts sank. Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng exchanged a look and felt nothing but relief that they had swallowed their anger earlier and not escalated the conflict; had they forced a confrontation, even two against one, whether they could have walked away intact was far from certain.

After a long while, that terrifying Shi slowly receded. The woman surnamed Ye opened her eyes; her gaze sparkled, her cheeks flushed, and a dazzling radiance shone from her as if she had received earth-shattering good news.

Yang Kai clearly felt her breathing quicken; from within her slender body came the hurried thudding of a racing heart.

What on earth had she told Yang Yan? Yang Kai’s mind brimmed with questions.

The others were equally curious — who in Dragon Lair Mountain could cause such a shift in a practitioner of this stature?

One must understand that a practitioner of her calibre would not show such dramatic emotional oscillations unless something truly monumental had occurred.

The woman surnamed Ye drew several deep breaths to calm her excitement, then looked at Yang Kai and asked softly, “Young brother, may this Transmission Compass be given to me? I can offer something in exchange.”

Yang Kai smiled easily. “No need to exchange. It’s only a Transmission Compass — take it if you wish, Elder.”

By now he had also confirmed that she bore no malice toward Dragon Lair Mountain and, more than likely, had some connection to Yang Yan — in short, she was a friend rather than an enemy.

Such a powerful reinforcement arriving all at once — Yang Kai was too overjoyed to fuss over a single Transmission Compass. Its value was negligible; it served only to transmit messages, and if he desired one Yang Yan could easily refine countless more.

“Very well, then I thank you.” The woman surnamed Ye was not one to dither; hearing his words, her face brightened and she happily put the Transmission Compass into her Spatial Ring.

At this moment everyone could see that this woman surnamed Ye must have some connection with someone inside Dragon Lair Mountain. Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng’s expressions soured as if they had swallowed a fly.

They had been applying pressure to Yang Kai and Dragon Lair Mountain, but if the woman surnamed Ye truly sided with the mountain they would have to withdraw. To make enemies of such a powerful figure over the deaths of those disciples would be foolish — only someone with a rusted brain would persist.

With that thought, Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng both felt the urge to retreat.

After all, revenge could wait; it was wiser first to investigate the woman surnamed Ye’s relationship with Dragon Lair Mountain.

“He really turned danger into safety?” Mo Yu of Qiantian Sect’s elder’s eyes shone with disbelief. He could not accept what he had witnessed. Just moments ago he had been lecturing Shen Shitao about the emptiness of fortune, claiming it could not be trusted — yet in the blink of an eye this inexplicable event had shifted.

That boy’s luck… wasn’t it a touch too heaven-defying?

“I told you his luck has always been good — see, I was right!” Shen Shitao was inexplicably elated; partly because Yang Kai had escaped harm and partly because her firmly held belief had been vindicated — no one was happier than she.

Over at Liuli Sect, Daiyuan secretly exhaled, while Yin Sudie’s pretty face grew cold with displeasure.

She had been hoping to see Yang Kai humiliated, kneeling and begging, yet out of the blue a woman surnamed Ye had intervened — and this woman was feared even by so many of the experts present.

Seeing that the spectacle was about to end, Yin Sudie could not accept it.

A pack of trash! she thought bitterly, yet she was powerless. She had only just advanced to the Origin Returning Realm; in both cultivation and rank she was inferior to the experts present. There was no place here for her to interfere or speak.

“What? Is there some heaven-defying treasure here? Why have you gathered — what do you intend?” After finishing her talk with Yang Kai, the woman surnamed Ye’s fine face turned cold. She glared around with murderous intent and demanded loudly.

At her words, many experts stepped back awkwardly while Qian Tong laughed, “Senior Sister Ye, you jest. There is no heaven-defying treasure here.”

“If that’s the case, will you still remain? Or must I drive you away myself?” Her eyebrows rose and displeasure showed in her expression.

“We will go, we will go!” Qian Tong hurriedly said, bowing slightly to Yang Kai as he spoke.

Yang Kai returned a grateful look.

With Qian Tong taking the lead, the other curious factions also did not wish to linger and annoy the woman surnamed Ye; they cupped their fists and turned to leave. Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng, unable to stand against them alone, likewise retreated with great reluctance.

Just as the commotion seemed about to settle, an anomaly occurred on the spot.

The Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth suddenly trembled, then became wildly disordered.

Everyone’s faces turned to shock; instinctively they thought the woman surnamed Ye had acted in bad faith and glanced at her — but to their astonishment she, too, had gone pale and stood bewildered where she was.

It was not she who had acted; rather, a genuine heavenly anomaly had occurred!

Thundering rumble…

A violent sound came from the sky, seeming to hover both near and far at once, baffling everyone. When they craned their necks to look up, all their eyes narrowed and their eyes trembled.

For above in the sky, at the position of the Imperial Garden, a writhing mass of silver snakes danced amid flashing lightning and thunder, as if the end of the world had arrived.

The Imperial Garden had hung above Dragon Lair Mountain since it appeared, quietly floating; over the years many of Dark Star’s experts had once teamed up to breach it and had suffered heavy losses without entry.

They concluded that although the Imperial Garden had manifested in the world, it had not reached the time to be opened — it could not be forced.

Every major force had stationed disciples near Tianyun City to monitor the Imperial Garden’s movements, ready to dispatch word once it opened.

No one expected the once-stable Imperial Garden to change at this moment; what that change meant was unknown, for the Imperial Garden was the Starry Sky Emperor’s private estate and the secrets involved were profound.

Right now, at the place where the Imperial Garden hung, dense serpents of lightning writhed and roamed, the thunderous roar seeming to rip the heavens and earth apart.

As that sound reached them, the Spiritual Qi of the world grew ever more chaotic and violent. Soon, one by one, five-colored orbs of light took form and filled the sky, drifting slowly toward where the Imperial Garden hung.

“Five Elements Spiritual Qi!” someone cried out. With many experts present, they immediately recognized the five-colored orbs as Spiritual Qi formed from the world’s five elements.

Looking around, everyone was stunned; the scene before their eyes was breathtaking.

For as far as the eye could see, all manner of five-colored orbs filled the sky. Even in places beyond sight, countless such formations rose and floated.

Though the orbs seemed to drift slowly, they were actually converging on the Imperial Garden with incredible speed, as if drawn by some irresistible force.

Gradually the once-visible Imperial Garden vanished from sight, swallowed by a vast, multicolored glow that enveloped it entirely. From within came a greater, louder hum that made the heavens and earth tremble.

“Could it be that the Imperial Garden is opening?” someone gasped. Though only a groundless guess, it lit a spark of excitement in everyone’s eyes.
