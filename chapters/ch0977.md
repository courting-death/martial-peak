## Chapter 977 — Entering the Saint Realm

A few years ago, no one had heard the name Yang Kai, but today, a few years on, his name has shaken the entire continent.

To be only thirty years old and already at the Saint Realm — such an age with such cultivation on the whole Tongxuan Continent is unparalleled, and naturally commands great attention.

Moreover, Yang Kai’s status was not low; it was he who had masterminded and led the recent great battle against the Bone Clan.

No one dared to belittle him anymore.

Everyone believed that from this day forth, his name would be spoken and spread across the entire continent, becoming its most dazzling star.

His future achievements might surpass those of anyone else.

When the human, yao, and demon contingents arrived, the members of the Ancient Demon Clan were already gathered under the leadership of Li Rong and Han Fei, encircling Yang Kai ten li away and setting a posture that would not allow anyone to approach.

The crowd could only watch from a great distance.

Once they saw Yang Kai’s present condition clearly, all were shaken to their core.

That extreme, raging heaven-and-earth power seemed capable of tearing the ground open and striking Yang Kai’s body with brutal force.

His upper clothing had already been blown to pieces, exposing his hardened torso.

There was no trace of him circulating any power; he relied solely on the toughness of his flesh-and-blood to endure that baptism of heaven-and-earth power.

Not a single drop of the falling celestial force was wasted — it was all absorbed into his body and transformed into formidable reserves.

His flesh writhed without cease, his body as solid as a rock; merely looking at him gave one a gripping, powerful shock.

Everyone could feel that his body was strengthening at an astonishing speed, becoming comparable to the most formidable defensive Secret Treasure.

The experts of the various races were all moved.

“Brother Meng, when you broke through into the Saint Realm back then…” Chu Lingxiao said softly, “how much of the heaven-and-earth power’s baptism did you endure?”

“About half,” Meng Wuya answered in a deep voice. “Any more and I could not have borne it.”

“I am probably slightly weaker than Brother Meng.” Chu Lingxiao inhaled lightly, comparing the commotion before him with his own breakthrough. He could not help but feel somewhat inferior.

Changyuan’s face twitched; inwardly he felt he truly should cultivate a better relationship with Yang Kai.

In that battle two demon generals had fallen, causing heavy losses to his demon clan; if he did not seize the present opportunity, he did not know what fate would befall his demon clan in the future.

That youth currently breaking through possessed potential that could surpass any single power.

Previously Changyuan had been puzzled why top experts like Li Rong and Han Fei would pledge loyalty to Yang Kai, whose strength was only at the Transcendent Realm. Even factoring in ties to the Great Demon God, it still seemed unlikely.

This was beneath them. With their strength, they were more than capable of establishing their own sect—none in the world would dare look down on them.  

Yet now Changyuan finally understood. Li Rong and Han Fei and the others had a longer vision than he did.

Because that youth might bring the Ancient Demon Clan a future they could not accomplish themselves, bringing new hope.

Amid the astonishment, Yang Kai suddenly made a move that chilled every heart.

Under that unrivaled pressure, beneath the heaven-and-earth power wrapped around him, he suddenly rose to his full height, glanced coldly at the sky, and then leapt — charging straight upward against the falling celestial force.

In the blink of an eye he vanished, his entire figure swallowed by the vortex of power gathering in the sky.

“This…” Everyone stood dumbfounded, their faces changing drastically.

Enduring the baptism of heaven-and-earth power is an exceedingly arduous thing. To storm directly into that vortex would multiply the pressure one had to withstand.

One misstep could mean being crushed to bits.

Those close to Yang Kai all revealed extreme worry and tension, fearing his rash action would result in disaster.

But in the next moment an anomaly appeared in the sky.

The whirling vortex seemed to be obstructed by something and suddenly stalled; then, astonishingly, the massive, fearsome storm reversed direction, and at its very center a whirlpool appeared to guide the storm’s movement.

Its rotation accelerated, yet the apocalyptic force of the storm rapidly diminished.

— They were being absorbed.

In less than a tea’s time the vortex vanished. At its center Yang Kai’s figure emerged, a trace of lingering satisfaction still on his face, even a hint of disappointment.

“That brat…” Meng Wuya chuckled, “so brazen and reckless.”

“To actually enter the center of that vortex and receive the baptism — Saint Lord Yang truly is an extraordinary man!”

“Congratulations to Brother Chu; Tianxiao Sect has produced a remarkable figure, one to envy.”

“We must also congratulate Elder Xu Hui — with such a Saint Lord, your Sacred Land will only shine brighter in days to come.”

A string of flattering congratulations rang out; Xu Hui’s smile stretched to his ears.

Having witnessed this battle and Yang Kai’s ascension in person, everyone now recognized just how powerful Yang Kai’s personal strength truly was.

Those who had formerly paid him little heed now began to reassess and correct their attitude.

Yang Kai descended slowly from the sky.

The experts of the three races spoke their congratulations in unison, from the heart.

Yang Kai cupped his fists. “My thanks to all of you. This great battle could not have been won without your efforts. I believe that future generations will not forget what you have given today, but will remember it with gratitude.”

Many wore expressions of honor and their faces gleamed with vitality.

“Saint Lord Yang…” Chen Zhou, Palace Master of Dragon-Phoenix Palace, suddenly stepped forward, stammering, “May I ask you something?”

Since the battle with the Bone Clan began, a question had been burning in his heart; he could not keep it in any longer.

Yang Kai glanced at him, sensing what he would ask, and nodded: “Palace Master Chen, could you wait a moment? I have something to tell you, but before that I wish to speak privately with the Demon Lord.”

“Very well, I shall wait.” Chen Zhou’s body trembled; he vaguely realized something and hastily agreed.

“Saint Lord Yang wishes to speak with me?” Changyuan straightened his face and fixed his gaze on Yang Kai.

“Let's step aside and speak.” Yang Kai motioned, then beckoned to Li Rong, “You two come over as well.”

Li Rong and Han Fei exchanged a glance, uncertain of Yang Kai’s intent, but they obediently followed.

The other experts remained where they were, enjoying the joy of victory and chatting about future matters.

“I wonder what Saint Lord Yang wishes to say?” Changyuan asked as he and Yang Kai walked a short distance, unable to help but inquire.

Yang Kai produced a set of brand-new clothes from the Black Book Space, dressed neatly, and then said: “Gou Qiong and Ba He are dead; please accept my condolences, Demon Lord.”

Changyuan paused, then let out a wry laugh: “They died as they should have. Thank you for your concern, Saint Lord Yang.”

“I only wished to tell you: although I originally intended to use the World-Ending Demon Eye to restrain Ke Luo, I couldn’t manage it because he did not come near me; when Gou Qiong and Ba He fell, I was powerless to save them.”

“I understand your difficulty; you need not be troubled by it,” Changyuan nodded gently.

“That is good.” Yang Kai grinned. “Now your Demon Domain is missing two demon generals and has suffered great losses — what do you intend to do?”

“What do you mean by that?” Changyuan frowned and snorted coldly. “If you worry the other two races will take advantage and invade my Demon Domain, you needn’t. As long as I live, no one can covet my Demon Domain!”

“You’re overthinking.” Yang Kai shook his head. “I only want to ask if you would be interested in finding another demon general to replace them.”

“Find another demon general?” Changyuan’s brow tightened; he suddenly snapped to attention and looked at Li Rong. “You mean this lady?”

“Of course. Li Rong is a demon clan member and her strength rivals yours. Serving as a demon general would be no problem, yes?”

“That of course would not be a problem. But… would Saint Lord Yang really part with her? And would this lady accept a post in my Demon Domain?” Changyuan smiled with deep meaning, his gaze fixed on Yang Kai as if probing his intentions.

Li Rong would have no difficulty serving as a demon general—her strength already qualified her to contend for Demon Lord—but Yang Kai’s sudden suggestion made Changyuan wary.

He suspected Yang Kai might have designs on the Demon Domain.

“I refuse!” Li Rong said coldly, her face hard.

Yang Kai raised a hand to stop her: “Hear me out. After this, I will be leaving here.”

“Leaving here?” Changyuan, Li Rong, and Han Fei were all taken aback.

“Wherever my lord goes, we follow.” Li Rong said resolutely.

Yang Kai pointed to the heavens: “I am going to the starry sky, so I cannot bring you along.”

“To the starry sky?” Changyuan’s expression changed violently. “What would you do there? It is fraught with danger. You have only recently advanced into the Saint Realm; you would not even be able to protect yourself there.”

“Yes, Lord, if you truly go, take me with you.” Li Rong hurriedly volunteered.

“I will go too!” Han Fei bit her lip.

Yang Kai shook his head slowly: “I will go alone. Over ten years ago when I first came here I was only at the Seventh or Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm and likewise lacked the strength to protect myself, yet I came through. Had I stayed in Zhongdu, I would never have achieved my present strength; if the continent’s people had invaded there I might have become a slave to some power, powerless to resist. Precisely because I came over back then, when crises arrived I could bring my family and friends to live near the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and keep them safe. The situation now is the same as it was over a decade ago.”

“How is it the same?” Changyuan asked, puzzled.

“The Great Demon God once sealed this continent, removing it from the sight of the starry sky; now that the seal has been lifted, it is possible that one day a Saint King Realm or even higher experts will come here — who then could withstand them?”

Changyuan’s face darkened slightly as he remembered the scenes from the Great Demon God’s memories and felt a chill.

Thousands of years ago the Great Demon God had held back those starry intruders; should such a scene recur, with the current level of masters on the continent, all living beings would be reduced to servitude.

A single Ke Luo had already cost them much effort and the sacrifice of two demon generals to slay; Ke Luo’s cultivation only approached the Saint King Realm and had failed to ascend.

If a true Saint King Realm appeared, then no one could resist.
