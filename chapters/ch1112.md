## Chapter 1112 — Mud Buddha Crosses the River

A roaring Demonic Flame suddenly erupted, its blaze ravenous and sky-reaching, carrying a profound intent to incinerate everything as it surged toward the Saint King Realm cultivator called Xu Wei.

Xu Wei's expression twisted; he threw back his head and laughed, "A fire-attribute cultivator? Fire is the one thing I never fear!"

As he spoke, a veil of watery mist rose across his body, concentric ripples like waves radiating outward from him; he seemed like a stone cast into a lake, sending thousands of ripples that braided together into a net saturated with an extremely yin and gentle force. Unafraid, it met the Demonic Flame head-on, intending first to extinguish the blaze and then to strangle Yang Kai, to make this mouthy brat understand just how far apart they really were.

The moment he saw the man channel his strength, Yang Kai understood that the other cultivated a water-attribute technique—and also realized where that overconfidence came from. Since ancient times, water and fire had never mixed. His strength clearly countered Yang Kai’s, not to mention his cultivation realm was higher as well. If he still couldn’t win under such conditions, then the decades he’d spent cultivating would have been for nothing.

Xu Tianze and the other Saint King Realm cultivators standing by plainly knew Xu Wei's background; they folded their arms and watched the show with mocking, disdainful eyes toward Yang Kai.

To them, Yang Kai's death was a certainty; there was no way he'd escape the strangling grasp of Xu Wei's water force. Perhaps in a little while not even a whole scrap of flesh would be found.

Xu Wei was sneering, and Yang Kai was sneering as well. Confidence filled the eyes of both men as they stared at each other—each looking at the other as though gazing upon a dead man, their expressions utterly devoid of emotion.

The ripple-like water wave rolled forward, but the extreme heat in that clump of Demonic Flame abruptly shifted and became bone-chillingly cold. The spreading water ripples seemed to freeze in place, completely arrested mid-air.

Xu Wei's sneer stiffened on his face as he stared, dumbfounded, at the uncanny scene before him. He could not fathom why his power would be suppressed by a ball of flame; although the fire was pitch-black and odd in appearance, it had been produced by a cultivator only of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

How could a flame of such apparent modest origin have enough energy to halt his power's spread?

In the momentary daze a soft, rippling crack sounded, and Xu Wei's blood ran cold—those frozen, ripple-like waves all suddenly burst into flame, and that fire spread toward him with terrifying speed.

Within the pitch-dark fireball surged eerie alternations of heat and cold, interwoven with two incompatible auras—masculine vigor and sinister yin—combining into a horrific presence that slammed directly into Xu Wei.

The Saint Yuan shielding his body did nothing to protect him; on the contrary it acted like oil on a blaze, intensifying the inferno. Xu Wei managed only a shriek before black flame wrapped his body.

He flailed wildly, unleashing martial skills in chaotic, aimless bursts and summoning his Secret Treasures one after another in a vain attempt to douse the flames. It was all for naught—the black fire clung like a death-seeking spirit, burning ever more fiercely.

He opened his mouth in agony but no sound came forth; it seemed even his voice had been swallowed by the flame.

In barely ten breaths, Xu Wei fell from the sky like a burning orb, smashing into the ground and shattering into pieces.

The air filled with a rank, acrid stench of char; the scent alone made one gag.

Eyes popped in their sockets; Xu Tianze and the other three Saint King Realm cultivators had never expected Yang Kai to be so ruthless—he was only Third Stage of the Saint Realm, yet with a single motion he had slain a First Stage of the Saint King Realm!

What manner of flame was that, capable of rendering Xu Wei utterly powerless?

Only then did they realize Yang Kai's earlier words may not have been empty boasting. Those Saint King Realm cultivators he claimed to have killed might number more than one or two—if he wielded such means, slaying Saint King Realm cultivators would not be difficult for him.

At the thought of this, two of them felt their hearts pounding. They stared at Yang Kai with eyes full of dread and apprehension; their own cultivation barely matched Xu Wei’s, and in truth were inferior. If Yang Kai could kill Xu Wei in a single encounter, dispatching them would be child’s play.

Life and death hung by a thread; both men’s calves trembled and they found themselves unable to move, casting desperate, pleading looks toward the strongest among them.

It was a bald middle-aged man, his cultivation a notch above Xu Wei and the others, yet still only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm. After witnessing the terrifying might of that Demonic Flame, he knew this was no place to linger.

He could not withstand such burning; that black flame seemed able to consume all things, bringing people an unimaginable despair.

“Still dawdling? He killed Xu Wei — strike now! Tear that bastard limb from limb; I want him to suffer!” Xu Tianze, the lowest in cultivation, stamped and shouted. Though a Young Master of the Xu family, his own talent was pitiful; despite the family’s years of using countless heaven-and-earth treasures to cleanse his meridians and marrow, he had only reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Lacking talent in martial ways, he never strove to improve and instead devoted himself to debauchery. Backed by the Xu Family's prestige, no one nearby dared cross him. Besides, he always had four Saint King Realm bodyguards; only forces the size of Yingyue Hall dared touch him—no one else would think of laying eyes on him.

Today one of his guards had inexplicably died; Xu Tianze saw not Yang Kai's prowess but only his own loss of face, and immediately vowed retribution.

Hearing him shout, the three Saint King Realm cultivators all glanced at him with strained expressions; at this moment they wished the family's useless Young Master would shut his foul mouth! Could this fool not see that the three of them were like mud Buddhas crossing the river—unable to save themselves?

The balding man suddenly looked at the other two. "You know what will happen to you if anything happens to the Young Master!"

Terrified, the two immediately turned and faced Yang Kai without a word, each activating their defensive Secret Treasures and lunging at Yang Kai together.

One of them waved his hand and a flood of silver light filled the heavens; hidden within that brilliance were layers of killing intent, enveloping Yang Kai.

The other silently slipped behind Yang Kai and a giant tiger phantom burst from his body, lunging viciously for Yang Kai's neck. At the same time he reached toward Yang Yan, who was crouched behind Yang Kai.

If he could seize that woman, he could use her as leverage to force Yang Kai to yield.

Though she was laden with Secret Treasures, Yang Yan knew nothing of combat—snatching her up should be easy.

The two moved in perfect coordination, clearly not strangers to working together; they were intimately familiar with one another's strengths and movements.

Yang Kai stood motionless. Just as the silver light closed in, a ring of black flame suddenly burst across his body, setting him aflame; not only did it wrap him, it also enveloped Yang Yan, who clung to his clothing.

The silver light struck the Demonic Flame and dissolved instantly. The cultivator who had rushed at Yang Kai's front face went pale—he had gravely underestimated the youth's ability—and hastily retreated.

"Think you can run?" Yang Kai extended a hand and fired a punch that slammed heavily into the man's chest.

The defensive armor he wore collapsed like paper. This Secret Treasure, of Saint King-Grade Lower-Level quality, was punched wide open by Yang Kai, and the man's chest caved in a great chunk.

He shot out like an arrow, the Demonic Flame clinging to him; his treasure and flesh burned away and he died mid-flight before hitting the ground.

As Yang Kai's fist struck that man's chest, a scream came from behind.

The man who had tried to seize Yang Yan had just laid his hand on her shoulder when Yang Kai's Demonic Flame scorched him.

He snatched his hand back, but the Demonic Flame raced up his arm. In a desperate move he drew a long sword and hacked his own arm off.

He would rather sever his limb than let the Demonic Flame consume his torso—both his companions had been burned to death that way; he knew the horror of that flame.

Having cut off his arm, he turned to flee without looking back, only to be met by another pitch-black flame that suddenly erupted in front of him and slammed into his face.

With hot and cold alternating, he instantly realized his face was gone. Using his last hand he clawed at it frantically to try to tear the flame away, but to no avail. His face was torn to bloody shreds; the fire soon consumed his whole body as he convulsed—he would not live long.

Yang Kai then turned his gaze to the distance; the balding middle-aged man had already fled at the same time the two attacked, bearing Xu Tianze on his shoulder, and Xu Tianze was still screaming that Yang Kai must pay.

Yang Kai's form flickered and he moved to pursue, but a tug from behind held him back—he remembered Yang Yan had been clutching his clothes the whole time, and judging by the strength of the pull, she had become even weaker.

He glanced back and found Yang Yan's face deathly pale, her spirit flagging, her delicate body trembling like a quail trapped in a wintry storm with nowhere to hide.

"Yang Yan!" Yang Kai cried out in alarm. He feared those men had poisoned her and, abandoning any thought of utter annihilation, casually unleashed a burst of Divine Sense toward the direction where the balding man and Xu Tianze had fled.

A faint azure light flashed from Xu Tianze's waist and offset part of Yang Kai's Divine Sense strike. Even so, Xu Tianze collapsed without a sound, while the balding man spat a mouthful of blood and felt as if thousands of needles prickled his brain—agonized pain shook his Sea of Consciousness and his spirit was nearly extinguished.

"Impossible!" the balding man cried in horror.

He had not expected Yang Kai's Saint Yuan to be so strange and indomitable, nor his Divine Sense to be so terrifying. Though he sat two small Stages above Yang Kai, he had nearly been directly exterminated. If not for a Divine Soul Secret Treasure on Xu Tianze's person absorbing the blow, the two of them might already have been dead.
