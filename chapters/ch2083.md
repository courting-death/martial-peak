## Chapter 2083 — Help!

Demonic Qi churned and rolled; the demonized Jiang Chuhe grew furious, opened his mouth wide, and inhaled sharply.

The writhing, surging Demonic Qi, like a whale sucking in water, frantically converged into his mouth and was drawn straight into his body.

Jiang Chuhe's belly seemed to have become a bottomless abyss in an instant...

With the Demonic Qi sucked in, the aura Jiang Chuhe gave off grew ever more dangerous; at the same time, the Demon Marks on his skin emitted a black, glossy light, as if containing some vast power, which made Yang Kai uneasy at a glance.

"Get him!"

Yang Kai shouted, knowing he could not allow Jiang Chuhe to continue like this or else something terrible might occur; at his order, the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal, two great Blood Beasts, transformed into streaks of light and charged at Jiang Chuhe from left and right.

He tightened his grip on the longsword, his body wrapped in sword radiance; man and sword became one as he thrust toward Jiang Chuhe.

Facing such a frenzied assault, Jiang Chuhe showed no hint of timidity; he only opened his mouth wide and released a deafening roar that rolled on and spread across the fields.

With the roar, a pitch-black pillar of light spat from his mouth and condensed into a rolling, ebony Jiao that bared its fangs and claws as it surged toward Yang Kai.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed involuntarily. His longsword flared with light, transforming into a field of slaughter that swept the jet-black jiao into the midst of his Sword Intent.

On the other side, Jiang Chuhe slammed out a fist that struck the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal's head as it closed in; this Blood Beast, which had originally possessed the strength of the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, emitted a sorrowful whine and its massive body was sent flying.

Before it hit the ground it was ensnared by countless Demonic Qi and could not break free; the protective blood aura around its body was corroded by the Demonic Qi, tearing with a sizzling, grating sound until a large hole was ripped through, and Demonic Qi immediately crept in through its mouth and nose.

At the same time a purple-green radiance flashed and an icy profound intent descended as the Yao Worm Matriarch manifested; the Purple-Green Twin Swords on its pincers fused into one and suddenly emitted a dazzling light that in an instant drove off the surrounding Demonic Qi and condensed into a massive sword radiance that slashed downward.

Jiang Chuhe seemed to realize he could not withstand that strike, twisted his body, and vanished from where he had stood.

Boom...

The sword radiance struck the ground the moment he disappeared, carving a deep chasm into the earth as soil and debris flew everywhere.

Elsewhere, Yang Kai had finally cleaved the pitch-black Jiao into pieces; turning, he saw what had happened to the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal and felt alarmed, instantly flashing to his Blood Beast's side, grabbing it and thrusting it into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Had he left the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal alone, it would not have taken long before it was corrupted into one of the demonic beasts.

That Jiang Chuhe had, in an instant, crippled one of the two Blood Beasts despite their joint efforts; it enraged Yang Kai and drove home how terrifyingly powerful a demonized martial artist could become.

Previously, someone like Jiang Chuhe would have been crushed by a casual flick of his hand.

The gap between the Dao Origin Realm and the Void King Realm was no laughing matter.

Within the Demonic Qi there was a sudden hush.

After evading the Yao Worm Matriarch's attack, Jiang Chuhe seemed to have completely merged with the surrounding Demonic Qi and vanished from sight.

It was likely by exploiting that advantage just now that he had been able to close in on Yang Kai.

With no enemy visible, the Yao Worm Matriarch stood silently, its entire body shrouded in a pearly white radiance that exuded intense cold—the sword intent embodiment of Snow Like Clear Sky.

"Hmph! You think hiding will help?"

Yang Kai snorted coldly, and as his eyes closed and opened, the World-Ending Demon Eye had already manifested.

He scanned the area and soon discovered a faint silhouette hidden motionless within a patch of Demonic Qi.

If not for the World-Ending Demon Eye's power to pierce illusion, even his mighty Divine Sense would never have detected it.

Moreover, not far off there were more figures using the Demonic Qi's concealment to silently approach.

The auras emanating from those figures were each scarcely weaker than Jiang Chuhe's; one or two were even a bit stronger.

Yang Kai's heart jolted; he realised he'd lingered outside too long and had drawn the ire of even more demonized cultivators — and judging from their strength, they were likely all Jiang Family members who had been transformed.

One of the silhouettes was extremely similar to Jiang Lin, the Jiang Family's Family Head—almost identical.

"Young Brother Yang, hurry back to the city—the array will soon be restored!"

Just then, from the rear in the distance, Qin Chaoyang's shout rang out.

Yang Kai's face brightened; he knew his task was essentially complete, but he was reluctant to retreat so soon.

Seeing the growing number of demons drawing near, he gritted his teeth and issued an order to the Yao Worm Matriarch.

In the next moment, the Yao Worm Matriarch unleashed its supreme sword-art secret technique.

Snow Like Clear Sky!

That icy profound intent descended over the area with the swing of the Purple-Green Twin Swords, instantly turning the region bone-chilling cold; within the space, freezing laws lingered like poison, corroding everything.

The demons moving slowly within the Demonic Qi were caught unawares and many were struck.

Howls rose as figures were revealed; those demons employed their secret arts to dispel the surrounding cold.

Seizing the opportunity, Yang Kai flashed to Jiang Chuhe's side.

"Condense!"

Yang Kai barked; his intent pointed and the Law Power of Space erupted, locking that patch of heaven and earth.

Jiang Chuhe's form was instantly exposed; at this moment a trace of panic showed on his ferocious face as he struggled desperately, Demon Marks crawling and flickering on his exposed skin, veins bulging—truly ghastly.

Yet he still could not completely shake off the influence of the Spatial Law Power; after all, he had only been a demon formed from a Third Stage of the Void King Realm martial artist and could not withstand the restraint of heaven and earth's Law Power!

Yang Kai tightened his grip on his longsword and drove it down in a ruthless, bone‑cracking stroke.

A desperate will to survive flared in Jiang Chuhe's pitch-black eyes; by some unknown strength he jerked his head to the side.

Sword light flashed and an arm was cleanly severed, black blood spurting from the wound.

Jiang Chuhe howled in pain!

Yang Kai was surprised his strike had not produced the full expected effect, but his eyes shifted and a better idea came to him.

"Bind!"

The surrounding space, as if responding to the command, suddenly compressed toward Jiang Chuhe; he seemed to suffer a tremendous impact, his bones cracking audibly as blood spilled from his mouth and nose, yet he continued to struggle without begging for mercy or attempting to flee, snarling at Yang Kai like a crazed beast.

Yang Kai formed hand seals and shifted continuously, then struck Jiang Chuhe.

Streams of Origin Qi poured into Jiang Chuhe's body, suppressing all the power within him.

After a short while, Jiang Chuhe had no strength left to resist—his cultivation was completely sealed within his body.

Yang Kai reached out and grabbed him, lifting him up.

At the same time, he called to the Yao Worm Matriarch.

The Yao Worm understood, became a streak of light, sped toward Yang Kai, and was stored within the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Immediately, Yang Kai twisted his body and dashed toward the city wall.

Seeing him appear, Qin Chaoyang's face brightened and he cried out, "Young Brother, hurry back!"

Yang Kai nodded to him and was about to slip through the not-yet-fully-healed formation into the city when his expression shifted and he turned to look back.

"Young Brother, what are you doing?" Qin Chaoyang asked blankly, not understanding why Yang Kai had halted at such a critical moment.

"Sir Qin, didn't you hear something?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Qin Chaoyang paused, listened carefully, and then his expression changed: "Is someone calling for help?"

He had indeed heard a cry for help not far outside the city; from the sound it seemed to be a man's voice and not a young one.

Qin Chaoyang's face flickered with conflict as he said gravely, "Young Brother, don't bother—whoever that is is probably already in dire straits; you must return first."

Yang Kai lightly nodded, feeling that Qin was right.

The danger of this Demonic Qi was far greater than he had expected; if someone rashly entered it, their mind would soon be devoured and they would be turned into demons.

Even with his current strength, he dared not remain in the Demonic Qi for long, or else it would be dangerous.

"Sir, wait—sir, help!" came the shout from behind.

That strange cry for help sounded again from the rear, and its source seemed closer than before.

Yang Kai's curiosity was piqued; he wondered what kind of person could preserve themselves amid the churning Demonic Qi and boundless demonic beasts and yet run so accurately toward them.

Anyone capable of that was clearly no ordinary martial artist.

"Sir Qin, you continue; I'll take a look first," Yang Kai said.

Saying so, he flung the still-struggling Jiang Chuhe he had in hand into the city.

Qin Chaoyang, caught off guard, saw Jiang Chuhe bearing a ferocious face and bared fangs flying toward him and was startled; without thinking he thrust out a palm.

Boom...

With a great crash and the sound of countless bones breaking, Jiang Chuhe spat a mouthful of black blood and his aura suddenly wilted.

Yet despite taking Qin Chaoyang's blow, he did not immediately die; instead he fell to the ground, emitting groans.

"Demon... demon!" the surrounding martial artists cried in alarm.

The nearby cultivators were stunned and shouted among themselves.

Qin Yu's delicate eyes glittered as she, too, looked at Jiang Chuhe with immense curiosity.

She was seeing a living demon up close for the first time!
