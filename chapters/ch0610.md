## Chapter 610 — Outside Senluo Palace

Facing the questions from those several young maidens, Yang Kai maintained a cold face and kept silent, pretending the air of a superior.

Shui Ling, however, was curious about everything and soon became fast friends with them, chattering away. But when they asked about Yang Kai, Shui Ling wisely kept her lips sealed.

After walking for some time, the girls despondently discovered they had learned no useful information at all.

They still did not know what the man and woman are going to Senluo Palace for, nor what relation it bore to Senior Sister Zi Mo.

Half a day later, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly paused; he concentrated and stared in one direction, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

He felt a trace of familiarity, an aura that belonged to his own soul.

Zi Mo should be over there.

The girls were still moving slowly, apparently plotting something; Yang Kai, too lazy to humor them, leapt up and dashed toward the source of the sensation.

“Hey……” The girls of Senluo Palace were startled and called out, but Yang Kai had already vanished without a trace.

After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, in the sky above a stretch of forest, Yang Kai hovered midair, looking down from on high, his brow slightly knit and his expression odd.

Below, the mountains rolled on with no sign of the imagined superpower; instead, thirty li away Yang Kai saw a vast, undulating complex of buildings, grand and magnificent, and even across those thirty li he could sense the auras of numerous formidable cultivators.

That place should be the Senluo Palace of the Tianlang Kingdom.

But why would Zi Mo be here?

Nothing visible met the eye; there must be a grotto within the mountain. Yang Kai’s heart understood at once.

He emitted a slight ripple of his own aura, and soon a coquettish scolding came from within the mountain belly: “What more do you want? We have already left Senluo Palace — are you going to wipe us out too? Have a little charity for old ties; after all, we all came from the same Sect.”

Yang Kai was taken aback, snorted and said, “Woman, why so hot-tempered? Demanding answers without hearing the facts?”

“You are……” The woman’s voice inside the mountain trembled as she tried to recollect the visitor’s identity, then after a long moment she cried out in astonishment, “You bastard Yang Kai?”

“Spare me the ‘bastard’ bit, will you?” Yang Kai’s face darkened.

“Giggling……” Like a string of silver bells, laughter echoed from the mountain belly. Before long, a huge stone slid aside to reveal a cave entrance, and from that opening a delicate, supple figure flashed out.

It was Zi Mo, styled as usual in a bold fashion, her exquisite skin bared to the air and inviting imagination. She looked up at Yang Kai standing in the sky with delighted surprise, as if she had not expected to see him after all these years.

She flicked her lips and said, “You bastard — instead of strutting about in Great Han, why come to our Tianlang?”

“I missed you, came to find you,” Yang Kai smiled.

Zi Mo rolled her eyes. “I’m not some young girl you can fool,” she said. Glancing at Shui Ling standing beside Yang Kai, she clicked her tongue in wonder, “You’ve even brought another beauty with you — you lecher, always chasing every pretty face.”

“Hey, don’t talk nonsense. I have nothing to do with him,” Shui Ling protested angrily.

“It doesn’t matter. If you stay by his side long enough, you’ll sooner or later be his,” Zi Mo teased with a coquettish laugh. “If you want to keep your reputation intact, stay as far away from him as possible.”

“We haven’t seen each other for years, you don’t have to slander me like that. I never did anything bad to you,” Yang Kai said, massaging his temples in annoyance.

Zi Mo puckered her bright red lips and huffed, “Nothing bad, huh? You groped and kissed me back then — if not for some accident, I’m afraid you would have forced yourself on me……”

As she spoke she adopted a pitiful expression, eyes welling with fake tears as if she had suffered some great injustice.

Shui Ling glared at Yang Kai with a face full of vigilance and ground her teeth, “So you’re that kind of man!”

“You believe her slander?” Yang Kai roared in anger.

“Senior Sister! Senior Sister!” At that moment, the several girls Yang Kai had shaken off finally caught up, fluttering down to Zi Mo’s side, all on guard as they pointed at Yang Kai and said, “This person said he came to see you.”

“Mm, I know. Don’t be nervous; he is not an enemy.” Zi Mo explained with a smile. “Although he’s a bastard, he once saved my life.”

“Oh.” The girls nodded and relaxed.

“A guest from afar, and this is how you entertain me?” Yang Kai sighed lightly. “Women truly are heartless.”

“Cut the sarcasm.” Zi Mo snorted, then after a moment’s thought said, “Come in and speak.”

“Senior Sister……” The girls were startled.

“Never mind. I’ll report it to master later.” Zi Mo reassured them.

Yang Kai’s gaze flickered; though he had many doubts, he knew it was better not to ask—questions only bred trouble.

He and Shui Ling vanished and descended, entering the passage into the mountain belly.

Zi Mo formed several hand seals and the large stone at the cave entrance slid back into place, sealing the grotto once more.

Inside the cave, just a dozen steps from the wall, a few crystalline lights flickered, making the place rather bright.

Zi Mo led the way with a buoyant, happy face; her gait was light, as if she hadn’t relaxed like this in a long time.

She guided Yang Kai into a spacious stone chamber within the mountain, had him and Shui Ling rest, and sent the girls to bring some fresh fruit.

“There’s not much to receive you with; make do,” Zi Mo laughed.

Yang Kai nodded, unconcerned, picked up a red fruit, rubbed it on his body, and casually tossed it to Shui Ling.

Shui Ling took it and bit into it with obvious reluctance.

“Wait here a moment; I’ll go tell Master. Outsiders aren’t normally allowed in here.” Zi Mo smiled. “It’s only because of you that I acted first and reported later.”

"Looks like I have quite a bit of standing," Yang Kai smirked.

After Zi Mo left, the girls sat down in a line and all stared at Yang Kai with curious, expectant eyes.

Yang Kai did not know what they were hoping for and said nothing, simply waiting quietly.

His Divine Sense quietly spread out, and after a while his expression became strange.

He discovered about a hundred people lived inside the mountain belly; one Transcendent Realm expert held the position of guardian, likely Zi Mo’s master. There were only a dozen Guardians at the Divine Roaming Realm, while most of the others were cultivators around the Separation and Union Realm, on the cusp of the True Yuan, and judging from their life signs, eight of them were young people.

Zi Mo’s situation here did not look very good, Yang Kai thought to himself.

Thirty li away stood Senluo Palace, Tianlang’s only superpower; Zi Mo and her people were a branch of Senluo Palace and should properly reside outside that thirty li, yet they dwelt within this mountain belly.

Besides, Zi Mo had said a few enigmatic things when Yang Kai arrived.

It seemed this was another internal dispute within a Sect. Yang Kai shook his head in silence.

About half an hour later Zi Mo returned, her face troubled. “Master says you may stay here for a while, but you must leave immediately. We are in a troublesome season and cannot receive outsiders.”

“I didn’t plan to stay,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Why did you come here?” Zi Mo sat down and asked.

“To return your freedom,” Yang Kai explained.

Zi Mo’s expression flickered as she immediately realized what he meant, then she shrugged and said, “It doesn’t matter; I don’t care.”

“I do care.” Yang Kai chuckled, then without further explanation moved to Zi Mo’s side and said, “Relax, I’m going to act now.”

Zi Mo stared at him in a daze, and after a long moment closed her eyes, relaxed her spirit, and let down the defenses in her Sea of Consciousness.

The next instant she felt a massive, destructive Divine Sense surge into her Sea of Consciousness.

The strength of that Divine Sense shook Zi Mo to her core; her face blanched in terror.

Moreover, the Divine Sense contained a power that seemed to burn all things; it felt as if her Sea of Consciousness would be instantly vaporized by that intense heat.

After a moment of trepidation, the Divine Sense withdrew from her Sea of Consciousness.

“Done.” Yang Kai said with a smile.

Zi Mo opened her eyes and immediately sensed whatever had bound her was gone; she felt inexplicably lighter, though a trace of wistfulness remained.

She looked at Yang Kai suspiciously and frowned, “What is your current cultivation?”

“Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage!”

A chorus of exclamations rose up as the girls covered their mouths in shock, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief.

They had never expected that the man they had once sought to deal with would possess such formidable strength.

Senior Sister was the most outstanding talent in their branch, yet even she had only reached the Divine Roaming Realm Second Stage; compared to this man it was like heaven and earth.

“Seems you had many strange encounters after that,” Zi Mo said with envy.

“Just luck.” Yang Kai shrugged. “Enough about that. I came for two reasons: first, to return your freedom; second, to ask a favor.”

“What favor?”

“I need to go to your Senluo Palace’s forbidden ground — the Wasteland!”

Zi Mo’s face changed.

The Wasteland was a lifeless expanse where not a blade of grass grew; it harbored all manner of dangers and strange energies. No one knew what calamity had once befallen that place; only that no one who entered ever came out alive.

Even Transcendent Realm masters who once tried to investigate the deepest mysteries of the Wasteland failed.

In Tianlang the Wasteland’s notoriety and peril equaled the status Ghostly Underworld Mountain held in the hearts of Great Han cultivators.

Both were taboo among taboos; ordinary people would not venture into such places.

The last time Yang Kai and Zi Mo went to Ghostly Underworld Mountain for an otherworldly trial, they had only stepped into the outermost edge and had not seen its true terror.

So upon hearing Yang Kai intended to go to the Wasteland, Zi Mo could not help but be frightened: “What are you going there for?”

“I have my reasons. I don’t know where it lies, so I want you to guide me. Don’t worry — just take me to the place; you don’t need to go deep inside, that way you won’t be in danger.”

“You must be courting death.” Zi Mo looked at Yang Kai as if he were mad.

Shui Ling, however, was thrilled; faintly she understood that the way home must be hidden within the Wasteland.
