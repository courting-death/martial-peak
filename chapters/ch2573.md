## Chapter 2573 — Xie Wuwei

The arrival of the three caused a bit of commotion. Not far away, a yao rushed over to investigate, but before he could get close, the Yao King held by Yang Kai let out a low growl and shot out like lightning, heading straight for the yao.

A miserable cry rang out. The yao didn’t even see who ambushed him before he was pinned to the ground. The Yao King opened his mouth and bit down on his neck, gulping down blood in great mouthfuls. In an instant, the air was filled with wails. The yao struggled desperately but couldn’t escape, and soon fell silent.

Moments later, the Yao King rose, wiped his mouth, and returned.

The yao’s blood seemed to be a great tonic for him. His previously emaciated, skin-and-bones appearance improved somewhat; his skin gained a bit of luster, and his flesh grew, with his depleted vitality also increasing.

He glanced at Yang Kai, his gaze somewhat complicated, but in the end he lowered his head and sighed heavily.

“How should I address you, Yao King?” Yang Kai asked.

“Xie Wuwei!” the Yao King replied gruffly. However, seeing that Yang Kai didn’t show the slightest neglect because he was a soul slave, he felt much more at ease. He had truly feared Yang Kai would start ordering him around. If that happened, with his explosive temper, he wouldn’t be able to stand it.

“Fearless and unflinching—Yao King, that’s a good name!” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

Xie Wuwei waved his hand dismissively. “Just a name I made up on the spot.” After a brief pause, he asked, “And how should I address you?”

Yang Kai said, “Just call me Young Master Yang.”

Xie Wuwei nodded slightly. “Young Master Yang, you said you wanted me to do something earlier. What exactly is it?”

He was clearly eager to finish Yang Kai’s task and be rid of his control, not hiding it at all.

“No rush,” Yang Kai chuckled. “Take me back to your territory first. I need manpower for what I have to do.”

Return to his own territory? Xie Wuwei’s expression darkened with distaste. As one of the Thirty-Two Yao Kings, his status was exalted. If others saw him associating with a human—let alone being ordered around by one—how could he ever show his face again?

Seeming to see through his thoughts, Yang Kai said, “Don’t worry, Yao King. I won’t make things difficult for you. If your subordinates ask, you can just say I’m a friend visiting from outside. It’s not unusual for a Wild Ancient Land yao to make a human friend or two, right?”

Xie Wuwei’s mouth twitched, and he replied insincerely, “No problem.”

If his soul imprint weren’t controlled by Yang Kai, he wouldn’t obey orders. But now, under the eaves, he had no choice but to bow his head.

With that, the three sped toward the depths of the Wild Ancient Land.

Xie Wuwei was clearly very familiar with the territory, leading Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi straight through without needing to hide.

Along the way, a few blind yao came to investigate, only to become food for Xie Wuwei to replenish his vitality.

Half a day later, a towering mountain appeared ahead. There were some buildings on the mountain, and as Yang Kai got closer, he saw they were all made of large and small stones, lacking beauty but exuding a rough, bold style, just like the yao’s nature.

From the mountainside, countless caves could be seen, each inhabited by many yao.

As Yang Kai and the others flew in, they clearly startled the yao, who came out of the caves to investigate. But before they could see clearly, the three had already rushed into the only grand hall.

Inside, several beautiful maids greeted them, fearfully bowing to Xie Wuwei, “Sir!”

Xie Wuwei was in a foul mood and ignored the maids, barging in without looking sideways. Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi, following behind, drew frequent glances from the maids.

After all, neither of them had any yao aura—they were clearly human. The maids wondered why Xie Wuwei had brought two humans back, and judging by their demeanor, they weren’t captives.

Atop the grand hall was a throne made of white bones, carved from the remains of some demonic beast. It was as rough as ever. Xie Wuwei strode forward, turned, shook out his robe, and sat down, his tiger eyes surveying the hall with a touch of majesty.

But soon, Xie Wuwei’s expression became awkward.

Returning to his own place, he relaxed and forgot his current predicament. Seeing Yang Kai smiling up at him, Xie Wuwei quickly stood up again.

“Just sit, Yao King. We’re only your friends from outside,” Yang Kai sent a message. He knew the Yao King’s unyielding temper and didn’t want to embarrass him, since there were still things to be done. Surface appearances weren’t important.

Xie Wuwei felt grateful, thinking this human was reasonable, and his resistance faded. He sat down again and gestured, “Young Master Yang, please sit!”

Yang Kai smiled faintly, then turned and walked to the side, choosing a seat for himself. As he looked around, he found this place far grander than Yang Youwei’s modest domain—whether in style or arrangement, it was on a completely different level. As expected of a Yao King. Yang Youwei, a mere Yao General, couldn’t compare at all. When he arrived, he had already sensed the presence of many Twelfth-Tier demonic beasts on this mountain—equivalent to Emperor Realm experts among humans.

The Yao King’s subordinates alone included so many Emperor Realm experts. With thirty-two Yao Kings gathered, how many would there be? Not to mention the Wild Ancient Land also had four Divine Spirits.

Such a group of monsters—if they marched out, only the combined might of the Ten Great Emperors could resist. Otherwise, they could sweep the entire Star Realm.

The Wild Ancient Land truly couldn’t be underestimated.

Zhang Ruoxi obediently stood behind him, her beautiful eyes curiously surveying the surroundings.

With a deep, commanding voice, Xie Wuwei called out, “Come!”

Six imposing yao immediately entered, seemingly waiting for a long time. Each had a fierce aura. Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, as these yao felt no weaker than Second Stage Emperor Realm experts.

The six yao entered the hall, cupped their fists, and said, “Greetings, Sir!”

Xie Wuwei lifted his hand slightly, signaling them to dispense with formalities. Only then did he speak, “Has anything happened during my absence?”

He didn’t tell his subordinates he’d accidentally fallen into the Tomb of All Spirits, as he couldn’t explain how he escaped.

The thin yao on the left stepped forward and cupped his fists, “Sir, I have an important matter to report.”

“What is it?” Xie Wuwei asked indifferently, taking tea from his maid and sipping it. The tea was deep red, thick as blood, with a strange fragrance.

The yao hesitated, glancing at Yang Kai, unsure whether to speak in front of a human.

He clearly didn’t want to report in front of a human, lest secrets be leaked.

Xie Wuwei tasted the tea, set down the bone cup, and said, “Speak freely. Young Master Yang is my life-and-death friend. There’s nothing to hide.”

He said this helplessly. With his soul imprint controlled by Yang Kai, his life depended on Yang Kai’s whim. Even if he wanted Yang Kai to step aside, he couldn’t. He regretted summoning his subordinates now, but could only let them report.

The yao were shocked. They’d wondered about the human in the hall, but now, hearing Xie Wuwei call him a life-and-death friend, they were even more astonished.

When did Sir Yao King become so close to a human?

Then they remembered that decades ago, Sir Yao King had left the Wild Ancient Land for the human world. That trip was extremely dangerous, and he nearly died. Later, it was learned that a human saved him, allowing him to return safely.

Unconsciously, the yao linked Yang Kai to the one who saved Xie Wuwei, and their arrogance and disdain faded.

The yao said solemnly, “Sir, there’s been a change at the Blood Gate!”

“Blood Gate!” Xie Wuwei’s hand paused, his eyes filled with shock as he looked at his subordinate, who nodded. Xie Wuwei’s breathing quickened, and he asked, “Is the news accurate?”

The yao replied, “Absolutely. It was first discovered by a subordinate of Yao King Xi Lei, but many saw it and reported it. Now, the situation at the Blood Gate has alarmed the four Saint Venerables, who are sending people to investigate.”

Xie Wuwei became restless, stood up, and said urgently, “Explain in detail.”

“Yes!” the yao replied, organizing his words. “Just over a month ago, the Blood Gate suddenly erupted with blood light, shooting into the sky, but it lasted only a moment before calming. Over the past month, the Blood Gate has clearly changed, emitting a kind of magic. Many who approached couldn’t help but want to rush in. Many have died there.”

“Bloodline attraction?” Xie Wuwei’s eyes flashed.

The yao nodded. “That’s our guess. I risked my life to investigate and found the Blood Gate really does attract us, making us want to rush in regardless. If not for Shu Yu and the others intervening, I would have died! All signs indicate the Blood Gate will open—the ancient legend is true.”

Xie Wuwei listened, deeply moved, pacing back and forth on the platform. After a while, he stopped and asked, “What do the Saint Venerables say?”

The yao replied, “The Saint Venerables are united, telling us not to believe rumors and risk our lives. Now, eight envoys have been sent to seal the area around the Blood Gate. No one can approach.”

“Don’t believe rumors!” Xie Wuwei sneered. “Bloodline attraction is our instinct. The Saint Venerables think silencing rumors will keep things safe. They’re playing it smart, probably just worried about new Saint Venerables emerging and threatening their status.”
