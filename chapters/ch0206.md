## Chapter 206 — The Cuckoo Bird and the Yang Family

The surname Yang! A very ordinary and common surname, found among high-ranking officials, martial families, and down to common folk and street beggars. Countless people across the world bear the surname Yang.

However, among all the Yangs in the world, there is only one family that would make Dong Qinghan specifically mention it.

That is the Yang family, one of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu! This Yang family, known for its eccentric ways that defy common reasoning, is also the top-ranking family among the Eight Great Families!

The Dong family is also considered a formidable force in this world, yet it still falls somewhat short compared to the Eight Great Families, especially the one with the most substantial strength.

If it were any other prominent family's young master who came to this desolate place to hide his identity and become an ordinary disciple, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians might not believe it. After all, which young master isn’t pampered and spoiled, enjoying all the riches and luxuries since birth, getting whatever they want?

But if this young man is from the Yang family, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians would believe it without a doubt.

This is because the Yang family's method of training disciples is indeed peculiar. Each generation of direct descendants grows up in this manner. At certain times, all direct disciples are sent out to seek opportunities for cultivation, only to be recalled after a set period.

This training method is quite dangerous, as these direct disciples cannot rely on the family's power and resources while cultivating outside. If they encounter conflicts with others, they might be killed. In fact, such incidents have occurred many times, with Yang family disciples perishing before they could even mature.

There are both drawbacks and benefits.

This method of training makes every direct disciple of the Yang family strong, washing away their dependence on the family. Years of struggling outside teach them that the only person they can trust in this world is themselves!

Thus, the direct disciples of the Yang family rarely exhibit the extravagance and debauchery typical of young masters. Each one is as sharp as a blade, with formidable means.

Moreover, through this training method, the Yang family has amassed countless martial arts techniques from various sects, enriching their family's treasury. If one were to say which family possesses the most martial arts techniques in the world, it would undoubtedly be the Yang family.

There is a type of bird in the world called the cuckoo.

The cuckoo lays its eggs in the nests of other birds, allowing them to hatch and raise its young. The chicks are extremely ruthless; not only are they gluttonous, but they will also push the biological offspring of their foster parents out of the nest to their deaths, monopolizing the care of their foster parents.

The cuckoo's reputation is not good. Just like the Yang family's reputation outside, the two share a significant similarity in their methods.

Whenever the Yang family's direct disciples are about to be sent out, all major sects and forces in the world avoid the Yang family like a fierce tiger. They fear that they might inadvertently take in a Yang family disciple, only to have them take flight after being raised.

The Yang family's method of raising their young has caused quite a stir among many forces, but alas, as the foremost of the Eight Great Families, the Yang family is too powerful. Even if those forces have grievances, they do not dare to provoke the Yang family.

It is said that a hundred years ago, a Yang family disciple entered a first-rate sect called Huitianmen. This disciple was exceptionally talented, a once-in-a-century genius.

The sect's master and elders were very fond of him and naturally trained him vigorously. They even discussed making him a successor, opening up many secrets to him without reservation.

As expected, this child was gifted; in just a few years, he learned all the martial arts techniques and methods of Huitianmen, mastering them thoroughly, which greatly pleased his teachers.

However, ten years later, this disciple, who had consumed countless resources from Huitianmen and was held in high regard by the master and elders, left the sect one night.

Only then did the people of Huitianmen realize that this disciple was actually from the Yang family!

The master and elders of Huitianmen spat blood in unison! They nearly fell ill from the shock. It was one thing to waste ten years teaching a thankless wolf, but many of Huitianmen's secrets had also been learned by him, turning into the Yang family's possessions. How could one not feel frustrated?

When Huitianmen's people came to the Yang family to cause trouble, they only received some compensation.

Because of this tragic incident, all sects and forces in the world became extremely wary of Yang family disciples. The lessons of the past serve as warnings for the future. If they waste ten years cultivating a Yang family member, only for him to run away, wouldn’t that be repeating Huitianmen's mistakes and becoming a laughingstock for the world?

Yet, no matter how cautious they are, the direct disciples of the Yang family must go out to experience the world. Before they are sent out, these direct disciples are kept hidden, with few people knowing their names or having seen them.

Thus, the Yang family is hard to guard against!

As the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians' thoughts raced, they became increasingly certain of Yang Kai's identity. About four years ago, the Yang family indeed sent out their current direct disciples.

So, could this young man before them be the youngest son of the Yang family? Wasn’t it said that he was not suited for cultivation? How had he already reached the Separation and Union Realm? While his strength may not be particularly high, it was not too shabby either.

However, it was not surprising that their young master recognized him, as the Dong family and the Yang family had a marriage alliance in the previous generation. The young master's aunt had married Fourth Master Yang from the Yang family, and the young master had visited the Yang family a few times when he was younger. They must have met before.

"Come in and talk," Dong Qinghan said, his eyes filled with a mix of disappointment and surprise as he turned to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

The two entered the room, which remained simple, but now featured a table with food and drink laid out.

"Sit!" Dong Qinghan said succinctly.

"Were you waiting for me?" Yang Kai sat down casually, looking at the spread of food and drink with some surprise.

A look of surprise flashed in Dong Qinghan's eyes as he nodded slightly. "After a few years outside, it seems you’ve grown quite a bit. The Yang family's method of training disciples truly has its merits!"

"People must grow," Yang Kai said, picking up a wine jug to pour a cup for him, then filling his own.

"Why are you no longer afraid of me, like a mouse meeting a cat? You even dared to hit me," Dong Qinghan remarked. He still felt the lingering taste of blood in his mouth from Yang Kai's punch, which had been quite heavy.

"What’s wrong with hitting you? You bullied me so many times when we were young; it’s about time I returned the favor," Yang Kai scoffed. This cousin of his held quite a grudge against the Yang family. Every time he visited, he would make a point to teach Yang Kai a lesson. Back then, he hadn’t practiced martial arts yet and was a few years younger, so he was no match for him. He always ended up with a bruised face.

Thinking back on those times made Yang Kai feel that he had been too lenient earlier.

"Back then..." Dong Qinghan's expression was calm, revealing no emotions. He downed his drink in one go and pushed the cup back to Yang Kai, signaling for a refill.

It was only natural for a cousin to pour wine for an elder cousin.

The two drank several cups before exchanging glances, both letting out a long sigh. Although their relationship had not been great in childhood, Yang Kai understood that his cousin only felt disappointed because he had not wanted to practice martial arts back then. He had wanted to force him to do so with his fists.

Overall, Dong Qinghan had left quite a few childhood shadows on Yang Kai, but it was all done with good intentions, albeit in an overly aggressive manner.

"I never expected you to come to a place like this!" Dong Qinghan chuckled lightly. "Hearing your name here, I truly couldn’t believe it. It took quite a bit of digging to confirm it was really you."

"My father sent me here."

"Oh? Did my uncle also train here back in the day?" Dong Qinghan asked, somewhat surprised.

"I'm not too sure. He didn’t say, just told me to come to this place," Yang Kai replied, having been puzzled about this for some time, unable to grasp the deeper meaning behind it.

"What about my parents?" After a moment of silence, Yang Kai raised his head and asked.

Dong Qinghan glanced at him. "Your aunt misses you very much; she has lost quite a bit of weight."

Yang Kai's expression darkened. When he left the Yang family, he was still an ordinary person. After not returning for several years, his parents must have been very worried.

"And... your aunt was once confined by your Yang family for half a year. Your uncle was even punished with thirty strikes."

With a loud "crack," the wine cup in Yang Kai's hand shattered, his face darkening to the extreme, a fierce aura emanating from his brow. "What happened?"

Dong Qinghan sneered. "Because your aunt missed you, she tried to sneak out to see how you were doing. Then she was discovered by those old geezers in your Yang family. You know the family rules of the Yang family; direct disciples must cultivate outside. No one is allowed to visit them in any way, and violators will face severe punishment! If it weren’t for your uncle taking her place, those thirty strikes would have fallen on your aunt."

Those thirty strikes were not ordinary! The Yang family's punishment hall possessed a special secret treasure that used Yuan Qi to strike. Even a True Yuan Realmpert would have to lie in bed for several days after receiving a few strikes.

If those thirty strikes landed, Fourth Master Yang would likely be bedridden for several months.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming the surging blood within him, and downed the drink in front of Dong Qinghan in one go.

"Those old geezers will pay the price sooner or later!" Yang Kai's voice was icy.

Back then, he was not suited for cultivation and had no desire to practice martial arts. As an ordinary person, he was still driven out of the Yang family, forced to cultivate alongside his brothers.

A twelve-year-old boy, merely an ordinary person, traveled thousands of miles to Lingxiao Pavilion. What hardships he had faced along the way, how could he explain it to outsiders?

"I don’t like your Yang family, nor do I like the people of your Yang family. You are too cold-hearted and ruthless," Dong Qinghan said, curling his lip.

The Yang family's method of training disciples is quite unique. While it can temper a person, it also leads to a very faint familial bond among the Yang family members. For the sake of maintaining the Yang family's prestige, they can sacrifice any member they deem expendable.

"Yang family disciples must train outside for a full ten years before they can return. It’s not even been four years yet; your aunt will have to wait another six years to see you again. I wonder if she can hold on..." Dong Qinghan's tone was filled with sorrow.

"On your next visit, please convey a message to my parents, telling them I am doing well and to not worry," Yang Kai said.

"I will," Dong Qinghan nodded slightly. "She is my aunt after all!"

As the heavy topic gradually passed, neither of them wanted to dwell on it further.

"You came to Lingxiao Pavilion this time for the Inheritance Celestial Cave, right?" Yang Kai asked.

"Of course! Otherwise, why would I come to this desolate place?" Dong Qinghan scoffed, then changed the subject. "However, your sect does have a few geniuses, especially that girl named Su Yan. It is said that not only is she powerful, but she is also stunningly beautiful, like a goddess. It’s a pity I’ve never had the chance to see her."
