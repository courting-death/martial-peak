## Chapter 1448 — Qiantian Thunderfire

Looking out, the black-robed elder did not seem to be grievously injured, only somewhat disheveled in appearance.

After sacrificing a defensive Secret Treasure, he finally tore free from the Demonic Flame’s embrace, his movements decisive to the extreme.

Yang Kai was surprised, inwardly chastising himself for underestimating the man; to have refined his realm to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the fellow’s combat experience was indeed extremely rich!

“Brat! I will flay you alive and tear your skin off, or else I cannot wash the hatred from my heart!” Having escaped, the black-robed elder showed no inclination to yield; instead his expression grew ferocious as he glared at Yang Kai, gnashing his teeth and threatening him savagely.

As his words fell, he opened his mouth and, puffing out his cheeks, blew a harsh breath outward with great effort, his expression strained as if he were about to unleash some mighty secret art.

Yang Kai would not let him have his way. Although he did not know all of the old man’s reserves, shifts in a battle often came in an instant; perhaps this ancient bastard really did have a single, decisive killing move.

At that thought, the Golden Blood Threads were whipped taut and shot forward like a spear straight at the man’s head.

The Golden Blood Threads were already unmatched in sharpness; having been nurtured by Yang Kai for so long, their might was tremendous and their transformations responsive to his will. After the opponent’s defensive Secret Treasure self-destructed, the protective armor alone could not withstand the piercing assault of the Golden Blood Threads.

Yang Kai was fully confident he could kill or grievously wound the man.

What startled him even more was that, faced with such a strike, the other party showed no intention of dodging at all. He simply stood there, expression solemn, as a torrent of fiery breath burst from his mouth—a searing wave of crimson heat so intense it was visible to the naked eye.

In the blink of an eye a crimson sphere of qi formed before him. Even Yang Kai couldn’t help but narrow his eyes at the terrifying power contained within!

It was still a fire attribute power, but this crimson sphere bore no comparison to the flames the elder had released before; its inner mysteries were unknown.

No sooner had the crimson sphere taken shape than the Golden Blood Threads had already arrived, stabbing directly into that mass of qi.

But a moment later Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly and he immediately retracted the Golden Blood Threads, frowning as he looked. The front section of the Golden Blood Threads showed traces of having been melted.

Had he not withdrawn in time, that strand of Golden Blood Threads would surely have been partially dissolved, and he would have taken some backlash.

Yang Kai’s face grew stern; he had not expected the secret art the other unleashed to possess such formidable power.

As for the elder, his once-ruddy face now turned somewhat pale; clearly the exertion of that secret art placed a massive burden upon him. Yet he laughed arrogantly, bellowing, “Brat, come and witness the might of my Qiantian Thunderfire!”

Saying so, he jabbed a finger forward and Saint Yuan poured crazily into that crimson sphere. Nourished by the Saint Yuan, the crimson mass swelled, and a scorching heat that made heaven and earth change color rolled out. The crimson sphere writhed and transformed, becoming a ferocious beast wreathed in burning flame.

Once it formed, the beast charged at Yang Kai with murderous fury; along its path even the space seemed to melt. The sand and stones on the ground instantly turned into molten iron, a gruesome sight.

Moreover, the beast’s body not only contained intense flames; streaks of pitch-black, fine lightning danced across its body, crackling incessantly and looking horrifying.

Yang Kai, however, showed no fear. A strange expression flitted across his face as his brows slightly knit, as if pondering something.

Very quickly he composed himself. With a thought a sharp bird cry rang out; accompanying it, a peculiar Fire Bird burst out from his body, its wings unfurling to cover an area more than ten zhang across.

An Artifact Spirit Fire Bird!

Once released by Yang Kai, the Artifact Spirit’s eyes gleamed with excitement as it fixed its gaze upon the charging beast like one beholding a delicious feast.

At the instant the Artifact Spirit appeared, the beast’s momentum visibly stalled; a human-like trepidation showed in its beastly eyes, and its charge toward Yang Kai involuntarily slowed.

The black-robed elder’s face immediately contorted, as if someone had punched him hard in the face; he gaped in astonishment and stared at the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

He never would have imagined Yang Kai could display a method similar to his own.

But worry and surprise were of no use now. He could not believe the technique Yang Kai displayed could be compared with the Qiantian Thunderfire he had cultivated for most of his life; he was full of confidence in his own method.

While he was lost in thought, the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird and the lightning-and-fire-wreathed beast had already collided. The two strange manifestations of flame entangled in an instant, filled with beast roars and bird cries as the clash raged.

The black-robed elder secretly perspired; although he believed his technique superior, he could not help but be anxious.

By comparison, Yang Kai remained utterly calm. The Artifact Spirit Fire Bird had swallowed several streams of Sun’s True Fire; whatever this Qiantian Thunderfire might be, it certainly could not compare to Sun’s True Fire.

Dealing with it should not be difficult for the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

Taking advantage of the lull, Yang Kai also took a moment to probe the other battlefields.

Kong Wendong and the young woman needed no comment; their cultivation levels were comparable. Without the Void King-Grade Secret Treasure Xuanyin Heart-Crushing Drum being unleashed, the two were evenly matched, fighting fiercely and trading blows.

On the other flank, the duel between two Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm opponents was much the same; in the short term it was hard to tell who held the advantage.

It was at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm front where Ice Heart Valley’s woman held the upper hand. Her opponent had been ambushed and grievously wounded earlier by Ice Heart Valley’s leading young woman and could hardly exert much combat power now, only gritting his teeth to hold on and struggling bitterly.

He would likely fall and be defeated before long.

Once this side resolved their battle, the advantage would gradually swing to Ice Heart Valley, victory for them all but assured.

Probing these situations took little time; Yang Kai merely spread his Divine Sense and immediately discerned the full picture. Just then a woeful beast cry suddenly echoed from that direction.

Yang Kai’s brows lifted as he looked that way and saw the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird suppressing the beast with overwhelming force; the Artifact Spirit treated the lightning-and-fire within the beast as nothing, forming a fire sphere to enclose it.

Though both were flame bodies, there was a clear hierarchy of superiority between them.

Yang Kai’s Artifact Spirit had long since attained intelligence. Nurtured by the Earth-Lung Fire Pool for tens of thousands of years, it was no ordinary flame. Having consumed several streams of Sun’s True Fire, its power had greatly increased; compared to it, the beast formed by the Qiantian Thunderfire was not in the same weight class.

Thus, as soon as they clashed it fell into disadvantage, and from the Fire Bird’s posture it seemed intent on devouring the beast entirely.

Seeing this, the black-robed elder grew both anxious and enraged. His trump card, unleashed with tremendous expenditure, had unexpectedly failed to produce any effect—how could he not feel like spitting blood?

He ceaselessly poured Divine Sense into trying to control the Qiantian Thunderfire-formed beast and force it out of the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird’s enclosure, but to no avail.

“Old bastard, look over here!” Yang Kai suddenly grinned and shouted loudly.

The black-robed elder involuntarily turned his head, wary of any move from Yang Kai that might allow a sneak attack.

But at that glance he could not look away.

At Yang Kai’s left eye a flower bud quietly budded into being. With a slight tremble it strangely took root within the elder’s Sea of Consciousness; then petal by petal the blossom began to spread out, as if preparing to reveal its beauty.

Terrifyingly, as the flower bloomed the elder’s Divine Sense power began to converge upon it, being absorbed uncontrollably!

It was as if the blossom’s opening drew upon his Divine Sense energy as its source.

In mere moments nearly one tenth of his Divine Sense power had been consumed, and it continued to drain at a terrifying rate; in perhaps no more than a dozen breaths it would be entirely exhausted.

Once the Sea of Consciousness dried up, he would suffer a mind-and-spirit trauma from which recovery would not be easy.

The black-robed elder, horrified, could not bother to force his Qiantian Thunderfire; he hurriedly mobilized his Divine Sense and attempted to envelop the flower to smother it.

Boom… a soundless rupture occurred within the elder’s Sea of Consciousness, the whole Sea wavering and billowing up enormous waves.

Pah… with a sound like the earth, the elder spat a mouthful of blood mist—he had clearly been grievously wounded.

Although by using his Divine Sense he forcibly dispelled Yang Kai’s Blooming Lotus secret art, he nevertheless suffered unavoidable severe injury.

Misfortunes never come alone. No sooner had the elder dispelled the immediate danger than the Qiantian Thunderfire he no longer controlled had been completely devoured by the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

The Fire Bird once more revealed its true form; the Qiantian Thunderfire-made beast had vanished without a trace. Yet if one looked closely, within the Fire Bird’s belly a streak of pitch-black lightning arced and pulsed, wandering without rest.

That, of course, was the Qiantian Thunderfire!

Pah…

Another mouthful of blood mist erupted from the black-robed elder. The Qiantian Thunderfire had been linked to his mind; now that it was swallowed by the Fire Bird the connection was severed, and the backlash naturally struck him.

One blow after another left the elder utterly dispirited; his face was as pale as paper. Where was the vigor of a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert? Now he looked decrepit and frail, as if a breeze could topple him.

One misstep and the whole board was lost. The elder had never expected that a mere First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator could drive him to such a state.

Before he could steady the Saint Yuan churning within him, a streak of golden light had already descended before him.

Yang Kai’s Golden Blood Threads!

Strike while the foe is wounded—Yang Kai had roamed the world for many years and weathered countless battles. Such a simple truth was, of course, something he understood well.
