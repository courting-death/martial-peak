## Chapter 1145 — Qian Tong's Show of Goodwill

He had to use a drop of Golden Blood just to seriously injure the two of them, cutting off one arm and one leg each while taking advantage of the moment — a losing trade. Yang Kai’s heart was filled with frustration.

A single drop of Golden Blood equaled three months of his bitter cultivation; it was not something the wind could simply blow away.

Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother likely had no fighting strength left by now — even an ordinary Saint Realm cultivator could easily finish them off. But since Qian Tong had already arrived, Yang Kai naturally couldn’t kill the Origin Returning Realm masters of Yingyue Hall right in front of him. If he really did that, Qian Tong would surely take offense.

Casting a touch of regret at Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother, Yang Kai finally stepped toward Qian Tong.

"Nephew Yang, sorry to have frightened you; I came late, how shameful of me." Qian Tong hurried forward, his face still pale with fright as he spoke.

As he spoke, he quietly glanced around the cave, afraid that the supposedly existent Origin-Grade artificer behind Yang Kai might take offense at his attitude. At the same time, he was inwardly seething — here he was doing everything he could to befriend Yang Kai and secure a better future for all of Yingyue Hall, while that fool Xie Hongwen was actually dragging him down. Utter stupidity!

Fortunately Yang Kai showed no sign of mortal peril; he was not heavily injured, and even now the Origin-Grade artificer had not appeared. That put Qian Tong somewhat at ease—if that master really intended to vent anger on Yingyue Hall he would have appeared long since. His continued absence plainly spoke of confidence in Yang Kai.

The more Qian Tong thought, the more convinced he became that his guess was correct, and his demeanor grew increasingly cautious.

It was no fault of Qian Tong for failing to see the truth—Yang Yan's existence was simply too extraordinary; Qian Tong could never have imagined she was the very Origin-Grade artificer he sought to cultivate favor with.

"Elder Qian, this Junior isn't gravely hurt." Yang Kai cupped his fist. Qian Tong had made a good impression on him; even if his advances carried ulterior motives, that was human nature. Seeking ties with an elder of Yingyue Hall could do no harm to his standing on Dark Star, so Yang Kai lowered his posture, calling himself a Junior, which steadied Qian Tong's heart.

"Very good, very good." Qian Tong exhaled with relief.

"Take this Rose Pill back, Elder Qian. I still have some healing pills on me. I won't need this for now; I appreciate your kindness." Yang Kai said, handing the Rose Pill back.

Qian Tong's eyes glittered; he understood Yang Kai's refusal to be indebted and did not press the matter. Laughing aloud, he accepted the Rose Pill, thinking that someone with a master of refinement behind them might not lack for good things—what did one petty Healing Pill matter?

"Nephew Yang, as for the Xu Family, I’ve already given orders for Luo Qing to handle it — I’m sure the outcome will satisfy you. As for the Haike Family, they seem to share some connection with you, so I’ll leave that matter in your own hands.” Qian Tong was an old fox, well-versed in what should and shouldn’t be meddled with. He hadn’t overstepped earlier precisely because he’d noticed many of the Haike Family’s cultivators standing on Yang Kai’s side. Though he didn’t recognize most of them, he knew Wu Yi by sight — the most gifted disciple of the Haike Family.

Yang Kai gave a nod of thanks, then cast a faint glance at Ian. Ian’s face had gone pale as he trembled forward, bowing his head. In a quivering voice, he said, “We were blind and failed to recognize your eminence. Not only did our Haike Family fail to receive you properly, we even offended you. Please, punish us as you see fit!”

Yang Kai let out a cold snort, inwardly thinking that Ian was simply too clever for his own good. If he had honestly begged for mercy, Yang Kai might have spared him for Wu Yi and the others’ sake. But to claim it was merely poor hospitality—wasn’t that treating him as a guest who had come to visit their Dragon Lair Mountain? And who ever heard of a guest making things difficult for the host? The logic did not hold.

Qian Tong heard the unsaid meaning in the old man's words and couldn't help but sneer, closing his eyes in disdain at the spectacle.

"Although none of you from the Haike Family struck me directly, anyone who dares offend me will not find mercy." Yang Kai regarded Ian coldly; Ian's knees went weak and he nearly collapsed.

"However..." Yang Kai's tone shifted, "whether you live or die is none of my concern. If you want to live, go beg Wu Yi yourself."

Ian froze for a moment, then his shock turned to joy. With a thud, he dropped to his knees and said, “Many thanks for sparing my life, Senior!”

He knew the Haike Family would not perish; no one understood Wu Yi's temperament better than he did. If he went to plead with her, she would not butcher her own clan—after all, she was part of it.

"Begone!" Yang Kai barked.

"Yes, yes!" Ian scrambled up and went toward Wu Yi, his mind already scheming how to petition her.

"Nephew Yang is kind-hearted; I admire that. If it were me, I'd have killed them outright to end it all." Qian Tong chuckled.

Yang Kai offered a faint smile but said nothing.

He could not bring himself to kill Ian and the others in front of Wu Yi; to slay them during battle would be one thing, but now that they did not resist, killing them held no meaning. No matter how sharp Ian's schemes, Yang Kai's strength was plain and he did not fear him.

"Nephew Yang, as for this little scum, decide his fate—old man Qian will support you unconditionally." Qian Tong opened his hand and tossed the swollen-faced, half-toothed Xie Hongwen before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and looked at Xie Hongwen with an indifferent expression.

But Qian Tong keenly noticed a flash of murderous intent in Yang Kai's eyes; he was startled. Yang Kai had shown no such murderousness toward Ian earlier; that he now displayed it for Xie Hongwen meant he truly intended to kill.

Xie Hongwen's death would be of little consequence, but he had a father who served as a deacon in Yingyue Hall; if Xie Hongwen were slain outright trouble would surely follow.

The subtle changes in Qian Tong’s expression did not escape Yang Kai’s notice. If Qian Tong had shown no reaction, Yang Kai truly would have killed him—after all, a snake left half-dead will bite back, and the Xu Family’s actions these past days had perfectly proven that truth. But the faint shift in Qian Tong’s demeanor told Yang Kai that killing this Xie Hongwen would bring him no small amount of trouble, even for Qian Tong himself.

How much power could a mere deacon hold? Even elders feared him?

Yang Kai suddenly understood. What Qian Tong feared wasn’t Xie Hongwen’s father himself, but the person backing him. It was just like how Qian Tong had shown goodwill toward him — his real goal wasn’t Yang Kai, but the one capable of refining high-grade Secret Treasures.

With that understanding, Yang Kai already had plans brewing in his heart.

Xie Hongwen had brought two Origin Returning Realm experts to cause trouble; if not for Yang Yan's formation, even if he had torn open space to escape this time, Wu Yi and Yang Yan's fate would have been dire. This matter could not be left unaddressed.

Seeing Yang Kai's murderous intent swell as if he might strike at any moment, Qian Tong sprang and kicked Xie Hongwen until he rolled like a tumbling gourd, cursing, "You wretch have shamed Yingyue Hall—do you think your father's position as a deacon makes you untouchable? Believe me, I'll kill you now and cleanse Yingyue Hall!"

Xie Hongwen's face turned ashen; he crawled back clutching at Qian Tong's leg and wept, "Elder Qian, have mercy! I know my fault; I won't dare again. I'll return and retreat into seclusion in Yingyue Hall—please spare my life!"

Qian Tong quietly studied Yang Kai’s expression and saw that his killing intent hadn’t lessened in the slightest. He sighed inwardly, knowing that if he couldn’t satisfy Yang Kai, Xie Hongwen would surely die today. So he suddenly roared, “A mere Saint King Realm dares ignore the heroes of the world! It was a mistake to assign you two Origin Returning Realm guards—they’re the ones who gave you the courage of a bear and the heart of a leopard! Since that’s the case, I’ll kill those two fools myself!”

Saying so, he suddenly unleashed two blades of force with a wave of his hand toward the two Origin Returning Realm men who were panting and tending wounds.

Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother had narrowly escaped death; though one had lost an arm and the other a leg, they had at least kept their lives. As they clung to that thought, Qian Tong's words struck them, and before they could react the two beams of force struck their brows.

"Elder, no!" Hong Zhen cried in alarm, but before his shout faded a hole appeared in his head, and the light left his eyes. His Origin Returning Realm Senior Brother likewise collapsed dead on the spot.

Xie Hongwen stood there stunned, a foul stench leaking from his crotch; his face drained of color.

Yang Kai too was stunned.

He had not expected Qian Tong to slaughter those two Origin Returning Realm experts. Hearing Qian Tong before, Yang Kai had taken his words as a veiled plea to spare Xie Hongwen because of his influential father; Yang Kai had planned to squeeze some advantage from Xie Hongwen rather than kill him. Yet in an instant, the two Origin Returning Realm men lay dead.

Startled but elated, Yang Kai quietly drew on the World-Ending Demon Eye's power and, unseen, absorbed the two men's souls into his Sea of Consciousness; a single golden light purified them away.

He had expended a drop of Golden Blood and, even with Yang Yan's great formation, still failed to slay those two. Frustrated at missing such a prime opportunity to grasp their Shi, Qian Tong had sundered them for him.

But soon Yang Kai understood why Qian Tong had acted so decisively—Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother were maimed; even if they lived, their futures were all but gone. There were no pills that could regrow severed limbs. Sacrificing the lives of two fruitless Origin Returning Realm cultivators to soothe Yang Kai's rage and grant Xie Hongwen a chance at life was flawless strategy on Qian Tong's part.

Indeed, when Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother died, Yang Kai's sullen face finally relaxed. Qian Tong breathed a secret sigh of relief; he did not know that Yang Kai's composure softened not for the reason he imagined, but because the two Origin Returning Realm experts' souls had already been purified and taken—only now could Yang Kai begin to understand what it meant to command Shi.
