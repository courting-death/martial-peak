## Chapter 251 — Facing Reality

After deciding to confront Bi Xiuming, Yang Kai naturally had no intention of showing mercy.

He had just saved this person's life, yet not only did he fail to show gratitude, but he also sought to kill him. Such a person was undoubtedly a disaster if left alive.

Moreover, Bi Xiuming had repeatedly mocked and scorned Yang Kai, further fueling Yang Kai's desire to eliminate him!

Yang Kai was not a kind-hearted person; when others bullied him, he would not simply endure!

Having suffered a sudden and significant loss at Yang Kai's hands, Bi Xiuming no longer dared to act recklessly. He glared at Yang Kai with a mix of fear and resentment, ready to unleash his full power. However, he saw Yang Kai raise both palms, and a fierce surge of Yuan Qi erupted from them.

Beast Soul Technique!

Two furious roars echoed as the blazing Divine Ox charged out, forming a triangular formation with Yang Kai as they attacked Bi Xiuming.

Shocked, Bi Xiuming felt a wave of terror wash over him, struggling to fend off the attack but finding himself unable to retaliate.

The two beast souls and Yang Kai launched a flurry of strikes, and within three breaths, they created a gaping hole in Bi Xiuming's chest.

Amidst the splattering blood, Bi Xiuming fell backward, his eyes wide open in disbelief, unable to accept his fate.

Yang Kai glanced around and saw that everyone was filled with shock.

The battle had been swift, and its conclusion even swifter, yet the outcome was something no one had anticipated. A martial artist at the Eighth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm had effortlessly taken the life of a True Essence Realm martial artist at the Fourth Stage, seemingly without breaking a sweat!

Especially Zi Mo and Leng Shan, who were even more astonished.

Though they had spent some time with Yang Kai, they had never witnessed him truly fight. Even during their recent encounter with the Demonic Beasts, Yang Kai had only displayed slightly superior strength compared to an ordinary martial artist at the Separation and Union Realm.

Thus, they had always regarded Yang Kai as merely relying on some special secret technique to control their souls.

Although they were wary of him, they did not truly respect his strength, thinking of him as just a small-time martial artist at the Eighth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm, and had not taken him seriously.

On many occasions, when Zi Mo and Leng Shan discussed this matter, they felt a hidden resentment.

Their recent boldness towards Yang Kai was partly due to this mindset.

However, now, Zi Mo and Leng Shan realized that the Yang Kai they had underestimated was astonishingly powerful. Bi Xiuming, after all, was a martial artist at the Fourth Stage of the True Essence Realm. If Leng Shan were to truly fight him, the outcome was uncertain. Even Zi Mo would need to exert considerable effort to subdue him.

After this comparison, both women were left in shock, rendered speechless for a long time…

Others felt similarly!

After killing Bi Xiuming, Yang Kai turned to look at his junior brother.

This person had been incessantly chattering, shouting for his senior brother to cripple Zi Mo's cultivation. When Bi Xiuming fought Yang Kai, he had even aimed his weapon at Yang Kai, spewing foul words.

Now, he had fallen silent, looking as if he had lost his soul.

His expression was one of horror as he stared at Yang Kai, his face turning as pale as a sheet upon seeing the killing intent and disdain in Yang Kai's eyes.

If Yang Kai dared to kill Bi Xiuming in front of everyone, how could he spare him?

The two beast souls bared their fangs at him and swiftly lunged forward.

"No... no!" the man struggled to rise, panic-stricken as he attempted to flee.

But now, he was merely a cripple with a shattered Dantian, devoid of any Yuan Qi. How could he escape the two beast souls?

The Divine Ox pounced on him, biting and crashing into him.

Screams and pleas for mercy filled the air.

The faces of the Great Han's dozen or so members twitched, and some soft-hearted martial artists opened their mouths, unsure of what to say.

In less than a moment, the screams ceased, and Bi Xiuming's junior brother also met his end under the assault of the beast souls, his body a bloody mess.

Yang Kai glanced around, saying nothing, and simply walked to the side.

Zi Mo and Leng Shan looked on, silently moving to his side, their expressions complex as they regarded him. It was only now that the two women felt a genuine sense of awe towards Yang Kai.

Setting aside the fact that Yang Kai had controlled their souls, just his terrifying combat power was enough to command their respect. In a real life-and-death battle, Leng Shan would certainly not be Yang Kai's opponent, and while Zi Mo might be able to put up a fight, she was unsure if she could truly defeat him.

There was little confidence! Reflecting on Yang Kai's sudden outburst of strength, Zi Mo assessed inwardly.

How had this man cultivated? How could a martial artist at the Eighth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm possess the ability to battle across a major realm? Everyone who came here was an elite from their respective sects, each capable of fighting beyond their level. Yet, in front of Yang Kai, all of that seemed insignificant.

He was truly the elite among elites!

It was almost predictable that if he did not die, once he truly grew, he would undoubtedly have a place in the Great Han!

"Thank you!" After a long while, Zi Mo finally spoke softly.

Yang Kai opened his eyes to look at her, smiling faintly, "Don't get me wrong; I didn't do it for you."

Zi Mo was taken aback, "Then what was it... was it just because he mocked you before?"

"Yes!" Yang Kai admitted frankly.

Zi Mo opened her mouth, forcing a bitter smile, "A tooth for a tooth! You need to change this character of yours! However... you are indeed very powerful; I had underestimated you before."

"What's wrong? Are you impressed by my grandeur? Do you wish to submit to me?" Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

This remark reminded Zi Mo of their unfinished conversation, and her expression instantly turned cold as she gritted her teeth, "One day, I will make you pay the price!"

"You also said it; I am someone who repays grudges. Threatening me is not a wise choice." Yang Kai shook a finger at her.

Zi Mo was frustrated but dared not retort. Continuing would only lead to unknown consequences. If he truly took her body, she would have no place to cry.

Moments later, footsteps approached from a distance. Yang Kai looked up to see the Great Han group, led by Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu, walking towards them.

Yang Kai stood tall, quietly observing them.

Ye Qingsi smiled at Yang Kai, and others who had some rapport with him looked at him without any psychological burden. Only a few individuals showed signs of wariness.

Yang Kai had just killed Bi Xiuming and ruthlessly eliminated Bi Xiuming's junior brother, who had no power to resist. Such a complete annihilation made them somewhat uncomfortable, but since their hands were stained with blood as well, they could understand Yang Kai's actions. At this moment, there was no hostility; they had clearly accepted the reality.

Bi Xiuming and his junior brother had been saying demoralizing things for days, so their popularity was not very high. The earlier scene had unfolded right before their eyes; everyone was not blind to the truth and naturally would not blame Yang Kai for Bi Xiuming and his junior brother's deaths.

In this place, where self-preservation was already difficult, who would still care about the lives of others? Especially when those lives belonged to two disliked individuals; their deaths were inconsequential!

Chen Xueshu approached, and he and Shu Xiaoyu each handed Yang Kai a large handful of Blood Beads, saying, "These are the spoils from earlier, and there are also Blood Beads left by the Demonic Beasts killed by Yao He and Yao Xi. In total, there are eighty-two; Brother Yang, please count them."

Zi Mo had taken down three or four dozen Demonic Beasts without resistance, and with the Demonic Beasts controlled by Yao He and Yao Xi, this battle had yielded an unparalleled harvest.

Yang Kai glanced at him and did not decline, reaching out to take all the Blood Beads.

Although everyone had a share in killing the Demonic Beasts, if it were not for Yang Kai's clever planning and excellent performance, they would not have had their freedom. Compared to these Blood Beads, surviving was their greatest reward. Moreover, after the battle, Yang Kai had also provided Healing Pills for them to use, which was already a great kindness.

"These are the Blood Beads from those four individuals, all from the True Essence Realm." Ye Qingsi giggled, placing four larger and purer Blood Beads into Yang Kai's hands.

Seeing Yang Kai's bountiful harvest, many were envious. However, despite their envy, no one attempted to snatch them, nor did anyone show any greedy expressions. Yang Kai observed the scene and, seeing this, secretly nodded, feeling relieved, knowing that individuals like Bi Xiuming and his junior brother were in the minority.

Chen Xueshu's expression turned serious as he clasped his fists and bowed, "Thank you, Brother Yang, for saving our lives. This kindness will be remembered, and if there is an opportunity in the future, we will repay you generously!"

A dozen people all solemnly clasped their fists!

Yang Kai also returned the gesture with a grave expression.

No one mentioned Bi Xiuming's death. Even if these people all survived to leave, they likely would not mention it to anyone. In this foreign land, deaths were too common; as long as no one revealed that Yang Kai had killed Bi Xiuming, his sect would not come looking for trouble.

This incident passed without further discussion, and everyone tacitly understood.

The atmosphere gradually warmed, and the slight barriers and wariness that had existed vanished in an instant. However, when everyone looked at Zi Mo, their expressions were still somewhat awkward.

If they were all martial artists from the Great Han, a smile could resolve any grievances, and it would be a good story. But Zi Mo was a martial artist from the Tianlang, and she had previously attacked them, which had elevated the situation to another level. Even if someone wanted to reconcile, they had their reservations.

Those not of my kind must have different hearts!

Zi Mo was wise and understood this point deeply. She slipped away to the side, her solitary figure hanging in the air, isolated.

After chatting for a while, Yang Kai suddenly looked at Chen Xueshu and asked, "Brother Chen, is there something else?"

Chen Xueshu's hesitant demeanor caught Yang Kai's attention.

Chen Xueshu was taken aback by the question, then forced a bitter smile, "We do have something we wish to inquire about."

"Feel free to speak!"

Chen Xueshu pointed to his Dantian, "The insects inside... are they dead?"

Yao He and Yao Xi were already dead, but the Control Soul Insects they had planted in the Great Han martial artists still existed, which was the main concern for everyone. Li Xinyuan from the Wen Xin Palace had already had his Dantian shattered; his junior brother, Zuo Fang, was supporting him. Who knew if he would become the next victim?

Hearing this, Yang Kai turned to look at Zi Mo, who expressionlessly replied, "They are not dead; they are still alive in your bodies."

Everyone's faces changed, staring at Zi Mo in shock.
