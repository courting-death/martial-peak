## Chapter 1613 — Poaching

Ba He and the others stood in place, looking at one another.

Shan Qingluo was distraught, her small hand gripping that Spatial Ring, which still seemed to bear Yang Kai's warmth.

She probed it with her Divine Sense; when she saw clearly what was inside the Spatial Ring, she was immediately moved.

Inside the Spatial Ring, there were neatly arranged at least two hundred Domain Stones!

She nearly thought she had seen it wrong, but after a careful check she discovered those things really were Domain Stones, each emitting a gentle domain-field power.

So many! Shan Qingluo's heart trembled, and her delicate body could not help but shiver.

She had been running through the Blood Prison during this time and had only obtained three Domain Stones, risking life and death; even so she felt she had gained a great deal.

Yu Xiong had obtained only one! As for Ba He, he had only two.

But Yang Kai had casually given him two hundred! That number was enough to send anyone mad.

Where did he get so many Domain Stones?

After the shock, Shan Qingluo laughed happily and sweetly, clutching the Spatial Ring even tighter.

With so many Domain Stones, she was confident she could, in a very short time, break through to the Void King Realm; she was confident she would not become a burden to Yang Kai in the future.

"No need to wait for Xue Lian and the others? What does this mean?" Yu Xiong asked, bewildered.

Ba He’s expression shifted, his eyes full of shock as he understood; he waved his hand and said, "Let's go, no need to wait."

Xue Sun also realized it; her figure flashed and she arrived at Shan Qingluo's side, pulling her toward a nearby, extremely hidden Void Passage.

That Void Passage within this basin connected to somewhere a million li outside Cuiwei Star; yao warriors coming from Di Chen Star always departed from here.

With the cultivation of people like Ba He and Yu Xiong, after leaving the Void Passage they still had to fly in the Starry Sky for three or four months before returning to Di Chen Star.

Fortunately, there was not much danger along the way, so there was little to worry about.

Two days later, Yang Kai left the Blood Prison and came to a vast, boundless wasteland.

Scattered warriors emerged from the Blood Prison one after another, sometimes alone, sometimes in small groups; without exception, each wore an expression mixing exhilaration with sorrow.

The exhilaration was because they had walked out alive. To go through the Blood Prison meant they might one day have the qualification to temper their Shi to maturity and qualify to ascend to the Void King Realm.

Even if they could not later ascend to the Void King Realm, having gone through this experience they could become outstanding members among the Origin Returning Realm.

The sorrow was that many of their companions had died!

Some forces suffered total annihilation among those who entered, such as those from the Fire Radiance Sect of Chi Lan Star.

On the wasteland countless warriors craned their necks, waiting for their sect's disciples to emerge; once someone was seen they greeted them with beaming faces and eager salutations, eyes full of covetous hope.

Naturally, no one came to greet Yang Kai.

He had rushed from Di Chen Star; Shan Qingluo and the others who had come with him had already returned.

He paid no mind to the bustle and instead released his Divine Sense to search for Qian Tong and the others.

He had come out relatively late; Qian Tong and the others should have come out long ago!

Soon he found signs and turned to head in that direction.

Not far off, a group of somewhat prominent fellows were surrounding a beautiful young woman, doing their utmost to extend invitations; each wore an exceedingly sincere expression and put forward tempting stakes.

"Madam, if you have no place to go, why not come to my Qing Luo Sect? With your cultivation and strength, once you join you can become an outer sect elder, enjoy a spiritual peak to yourself, and every month receive a considerable amount of Crystal Stone and Pills. Our Qing Luo Sect has seventy-two main peaks, one of which is currently empty and has not yet found a suitable owner."

"Qing Luo Sect is nothing — Madam, come to our Tianmeng Hall. Our Tianmeng Hall has Void King Realm experts stationed; every three years there is an opportunity to receive imparted cultivation experience and explanations of Domain mysteries; Madam, you must not miss it."

"If Madam can come to Yuling Pavilion, I can guarantee that upon entering you will be an inner sect elder; Yuling Pavilion will spare no effort to assist your cultivation and ensure you break through to the Void King Realm soon!"

The beautiful young woman paid the surrounding noise no heed, only furrowing her brows as she stood, seeming to be waiting for someone and glancing about from time to time.

Annoyed by their words, she shook her head: "Sorry, everyone, I already have a sect and do not intend to leave it, so please do not waste your time on me."

"Having a sect does not matter," the Yuling Pavilion elder who had urged her laughed. "I am not asking you to leave your current sect; Madam, you can join Yuling Pavilion in your current capacity — it does not conflict."

To win her over he seemed to lower his bottom line and did not mind her original sect.

"Sorry, I have no such intention," the woman still shook her head.

"Elder Lin," Yang Kai walked over and addressed the woman.

Hearing the call, Lin Yurao's beautiful eyes brightened; she quickly turned and said with delight, "Sect Master, you're finally out."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and glanced around. "Why are you alone? Where are Qian Tong and the others?"

Lin Yurao opened her mouth and, showing a troubled expression, said, "It's not convenient to speak here; let's walk and talk."

Seeing her odd expression, Yang Kai did not press the matter and nodded: "Fine."

"Friend, wait!" Seeing Yang Kai about to take Lin Yurao away, those who had surrounded her became anxious and hurriedly blocked his path.

"Is there a problem?" Yang Kai frowned.

The elder who had spoken earlier chuckled, cupped his fist, and politely asked, "Friend, are you the Sect Master of this Madam's sect?"

"Yes, why?"

"Nothing much. I am the Great Elder of Yuling Pavilion, here on behalf of Yuling Pavilion to invite this Madam to join as an inner gate elder!" Seeing Yang Kai was only a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the elder could not help but feel disdain; otherwise he would not dare to try to poach in front of Yang Kai.

After all, doing such a thing felt somewhat immoral...

"Is that what you intend?" Yang Kai looked at the others.

"Indeed." They all nodded, their expressions plain.

"What do you make of it?" Yang Kai turned to Lin Yurao.

Lin Yurao smoothed the hair beside her ear and replied lightly, "Sect Master, there is no need for you to ask; I will not leave the Lingxiao Sect."

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "You heard her? Well then, farewell."

Saying so, Yang Kai prepared to lead Lin Yurao away.

"Madam, won't you reconsider? If you feel my sincerity lacking, we can discuss further — anything is negotiable," the elder chattered on, closely following Lin Yurao.

"Get lost!" Yang Kai's expression turned cold and he shouted at the elder.

They had greeted him with smiles, and Yang Kai hadn’t intended to make things difficult for them—he’d only asked Lin Yurao a simple question. Yet after getting her answer, the other party still pressed on relentlessly, as if he were beneath their notice.

This was blatant contempt! Yang Kai was not made of clay; of course he had some temper.

The elder was stunned. Immediately his face darkened; he sneered and said, "Kid, this has nothing to do with you — you'd better shut your mouth, or..."

"Or what?" Yang Kai retorted coldly.

"Or you'll regret it. Don't think that just because you're some Sect Master you can go around acting unrestrained. Who do you think you are? The head of a sect, yet your own sect's elders are stronger than you — what kind of Sect Master are you? In my view, this Madam is being wasted there; she would be better off serving Yuling Pavilion early and enjoying a bright future."

As the elder spoke, the other men who had invited Lin Yurao began chattering, belittling Yang Kai's cultivation and urging him to let her go, not to waste Lin Yurao's future.

“What’s all this noise?” Yang Kai said coldly, his patience wearing thin. “Elder Lin has already refused you, yet you keep pestering her—do you not take me seriously?"

"Do I need to take you seriously? Ridiculous!" the elder snorted.

The others also looked at Yang Kai with open disdain—it was clear they held him in no regard at all.

The conflict attracted much attention. Seeing Yang Kai, a mere Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, provoke so many opponents, many felt pity and thought he would surely suffer for it.

"Old man, if you don't want to die then don't provoke him. Don't look down on him for his low cultivation; he's not someone you can handle," a sudden voice said. The elder and his group frowned. Following the voice they saw an unremarkable young man standing with his hands behind his back, a mocking smile on his lips.

The elder, insulted and about to retort, suddenly noticed a three-petal flower embroidered on the young man's chest. His face changed as if he realized something, and he respectfully cupped his fists: "May I ask, friend, what relation are you to Lord Wudao?"

The youth said lightly, "He is my master!"

A collective intake of breath rang out; everyone looked at the youth in shock, seemingly unwilling to believe it and full of envy.

"My heavens, this man is actually a disciple of Lord Wudao."

"It was rumored Lord Wudao did indeed take a disciple fifty years ago, but no one ever knew who — so it was him."

"He actually came to take part in the Blood Prison Trial as well."

"What did he mean just now? Could that Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm fellow also have such a background?"

Upon learning this youth was Wudao's disciple, everyone's expressions changed to awe and envy.

The Yuling Pavilion elder no longer dared belittle him and frowned: "Friend, may I ask what you just..."

The youth still stood with his hands behind his back and lightly shook his head: "You already heard me — what are you asking? If you want to die, then keep provoking."

The elder's face went pale; he glanced fearfully at Yang Kai, as if sensing some vast backing behind him and no longer daring to act recklessly.
