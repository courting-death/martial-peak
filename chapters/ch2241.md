## Chapter 2241 — Return

Three days later, within the forbidden cave of Qingyang Shrine, in one of the stone rooms, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes.

His Spirit Body had returned to his physical form, and the sensation at this moment was indescribably wondrous, making him feel as if he had been reborn.

He moved his limbs slightly and found nothing amiss. Although he had stayed in the stone chamber for nearly a month, with his current cultivation Yang Kai had suffered no harm. On the contrary, after tempering himself in the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, his Divine Sense had made significant progress.

He did not rush to leave, but first checked his current condition.

Looking inward, his Sea of Consciousness was calm and tranquil, yet the waters were much stronger than a month ago.

Before entering the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was already strong enough to rival a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. This time, after absorbing so many Divine Soul Origins in the Divine Roaming Mirror, it had naturally grown much stronger.

Moreover, he had also obtained a piece of Soul Jade, though the power of that Soul Jade could not manifest in a short time. In the days to come, it would be slowly fed back to his soul by the Warm Spirit Lotus.

Now, the strength of his Divine Sense could be said to be second to none below the Emperor, with his Divine Sense already half a step into the Emperor Realm. Once his physical cultivation caught up, he would be able to break through smoothly.

Within the Warm Spirit Lotus, the ball of light sealing the Soul-Devouring Worms still rested there safely, without the slightest abnormality.

But Yang Kai knew he had to deal with it as soon as possible. Keeping such a thing in his Sea of Consciousness was always a hidden danger; it could erupt at any moment.

Especially if his Divine Sense were to be injured. This matter could not be delayed.

And in his Sea of Consciousness, there was also a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, now dim and without luster. It was the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier that Gao Xueting had given him before. This Divine Soul Secret Treasure had its spirit destroyed by Ban Qing when Yang Kai fought him, and it could no longer be used. It would need careful nurturing to recover.

Yang Kai sorted through the matters he needed to handle, made up his mind, then took out the restriction token Gao Xueting had given him earlier, lifted the stone chamber’s restriction, and walked out.

Looking around, as expected, the other stone chambers were already empty.

It seemed that while he and Tian Yan were together for those few days, Xia Sheng and the others had already been brought back here by Wen Zishan, and were now likely being treated for their injuries.

As for the Divine Roaming Mirror, it still stood in the very center of the cave, slowly rotating and radiating a mysterious light.

Looking at this extraordinary treasure, Yang Kai’s heart stirred.

At this moment, he could sense a faint connection between himself and the Divine Roaming Mirror.

This connection originated from the seal on the Warm Spirit Lotus, because within the seal was the power of the Mirror Soul.

“You’re out!” In the darkness, a person’s voice suddenly rang out.

Yang Kai was startled for a moment, then quickly cupped his fists in that direction and said, “Elder Gao!”

Gao Xueting was undoubtedly waiting here for Yang Kai. Seeing him return safely, she nodded slightly and said, “There was a slight mishap in this trial. You all nearly suffered a great disaster. It was my failure to take proper care of you.”

She, an Emperor Realm cultivator, admitted her mistake openly in front of Yang Kai, without the slightest attempt to shift the blame, which moved him greatly.

He said, “This was not Elder Gao’s fault. It was all due to Granny You’s cunning schemes. By the way, how is Granny You now?”

Gao Xueting replied, “The Hall Master will deal with Granny You’s matter. You need not concern yourself.”

“And what about Brother Xia and the others?” Yang Kai asked again.

“Xia Sheng and the others suffered some shock to their souls, but nothing serious. They’ll recover after a few months of rest.”

“That’s good!” Yang Kai let out a slight breath. Although he had thought before that Xia Sheng and the others were not in any real danger, and Granny You had not gone for the kill when searching the Warm Spirit Lotus, it was only now that he could truly relax.

“Since matters here are settled, come with me. The Hall Master wishes to see you.” Gao Xueting said, then led Yang Kai outside, reminding him as they left, “The Divine Roaming Mirror is the greatest secret of the Shrine. You must keep this to yourself and never reveal it to outsiders.”

“Yes!” Yang Kai replied solemnly.

Along the way, Gao Xueting remained silent, only leading Yang Kai as they sped toward Ten Thousand Saints Peak.

However, Yang Kai noticed that several times she seemed about to speak, as if she wanted to ask something, but ultimately said nothing.

Yang Kai guessed that what she wanted to ask was probably about Tian Yan.

Even Wen Zishan summoning him immediately after he came out was likely because of Tian Yan.

There was a Great Emperor within the Divine Roaming Mirror. This was simply astonishing—probably even Wen Zishan had not anticipated it.

Soon, the two arrived at the Ten Thousand Saints Peak. Gao Xueting stopped outside the hall and said to Yang Kai, “Go in yourself. The Hall Master is inside.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and, familiar with the way, walked toward the main hall.

Inside the hall, Wen Zishan sat alone, his expression grave, cross-legged.

When he saw Yang Kai push open the door and enter, his eyes lit up and he smiled, “Boy, you’re finally back.”

Yang Kai stepped forward a few paces, cupped his fists, and said, “Greetings, Hall Master Wen. I was delayed by a few matters.”

“Good, as long as you’re back safely!” Wen Zishan beckoned to Yang Kai, “Come, have a cup of spirit wine to calm your nerves.”

As he spoke, he waved his hand, and a table, chairs, and wine jug appeared before them.

Yang Kai was surprised, but did not refuse. He strode forward and sat down across from Wen Zishan.

“This Lord has quite a few things to ask you.” Wen Zishan poured himself a cup, then poured one for Yang Kai as well, showing his easygoing nature. “If you feel you can answer, speak freely. If not, I won’t force you—just pretend I never asked, all right?”

His attitude was extremely amiable, and Yang Kai quickly said, “Thank you for your understanding, Hall Master Wen.”

“Mm!” Wen Zishan nodded, saying nothing more, as if pondering where to begin.

Yang Kai had already picked up his cup and taken a sip. Seeing Wen Zishan remain silent, he smiled, “This wine of yours, Hall Master Wen, can’t compare to Monkey God Wine.”

Wen Zishan looked at Yang Kai in surprise, “You met Yi Quan?”

Yang Kai nodded, “I did. Senior Yi Quan also told me some stories about you from back in the day.”

“Did that old rascal tell you how he got me drunk with several jars of Monkey God Wine?” Wen Zishan curled his lip.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh, “Exactly so.”

“Hmph!” Wen Zishan snorted, “If I hadn’t pretended to be a poor drinker and talked nonsense, would that old rascal have let me drink so much? It was all part of this Lord’s plan!”

Yang Kai was stunned by this, not knowing which of these two Third Stage Emperor Realm experts, living in different worlds, had come out on top in their battle of wits.

“Senior Yi Quan still thinks of you, Hall Master Wen. He said you haven’t visited since you went there centuries ago, which left him quite disappointed. He’s prepared plenty of Monkey God Wine, just waiting for your grand arrival.”

“Hahaha!” Wen Zishan laughed heartily. “At least he still has some conscience! Mm... I haven’t gone in all these years because I was worried that old woman would get suspicious. But now that she’s been locked up by this Lord, I can go to the Divine Roaming Mirror whenever I want. The only question is whether Yi Quan’s Monkey God Wine will be enough for me.”

After saying this, his expression suddenly turned solemn, and he said in a deep voice, “I heard from Little Xueting that outside the royal city of the Divine Roaming Nation, a Great Emperor suddenly appeared and took you away?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai replied seriously, nodding.

“Are you certain the other party was a Great Emperor?” Wen Zishan’s expression was extremely grave.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then said, “My cultivation is low, so I can’t judge his true realm. But forgive me for saying this, Hall Master Wen...”

“No problem!”

“That person is much stronger than you!”

Wen Zishan’s expression grew even more serious.

“Since Hall Master Wen has entered the Divine Roaming Mirror and knows Senior Yi Quan, you must also be familiar with Zhou Dian. And as for Granny You, her Spirit Body was also at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Compared to them, that senior has already surpassed the level you all stand upon.”

“Then he must be a Great Emperor!” Wen Zishan took a deep breath, his face full of disbelief. “It’s hard to imagine that such a place could produce a Great Emperor! If word of this got out, it would shake the entire Star Realm. By the way, how does that senior address himself?”

“He calls himself Tian Yan!” Yang Kai answered.

“Great Emperor Tian Yan!” Wen Zishan muttered, then looked at Yang Kai again. “Why did Lord Tian Yan take you away?”

In this world, any Great Emperor is worthy of recognition and respect, so even though Wen Zishan had never met Tian Yan, he still addressed him respectfully.

This was not only respect for a true expert, but also for the Martial Dao itself.

“It was for the Soul-Devouring Worms,” Yang Kai replied. He felt there was no need to hide this from Wen Zishan. Although this Hall Master was eccentric and unorthodox, Yang Kai could sense that he was a reliable and upright senior at critical moments.

If not, he would not have revealed the secret of the Divine Roaming Mirror to Yang Kai, nor arranged for him to enter it for training.

Previously, regarding the reward of Star Seals, Wen Zishan could have simply let Yang Kai pick three items from the Treasure Vault and been done with it.

Just for Wen Zishan being willing to share the sect’s greatest secret, Yang Kai felt there was no need to hide anything from him.

“Soul-Devouring Worms?” Wen Zishan raised his eyebrows, but soon seemed to recall something. “I heard from Yi Quan before that in that world, there was once a battle called the Holy War, and its source seemed to be a group of sacred insects. Could it be...?”

“Yes, the source was indeed the Soul-Devouring Worms. Senior Tian Yan asked me to bring them out of that world, so I was delayed a few days.”

“Soul-Devouring Worms are the nemesis of the soul! I don’t know what method you have to restrain them, or if Lord Tian Yan helped you, but even with a treasure like the Warm Spirit Lotus, you must not be careless!” Wen Zishan warned gravely.

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood that he must have discussed the matter with Granny You in detail, and also learned about the Warm Spirit Lotus.
