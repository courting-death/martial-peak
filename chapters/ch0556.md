## Chapter 556 — Who Wants to Leave

Yang Kai furrowed his brow and inquired, “What grade level?”

Up until now, he hadn’t clearly understood the grade levels of Wan Yao Ling Ye, Wan Yao Ling Milk, or Wan Yao Ling Paste because no one had ever ranked them. Now hearing Meng Wuya speak of it, he naturally became curious.

Meng Wuya didn’t answer directly but pondered aloud, “The Eight Great Families are coveting this, aren’t they?”

“About so,” Yang Kai nodded slightly, deep in suspicion. He noticed that whenever it involved something high-end, Meng Wuya would always evade the topic and refuse to talk much. Yang Kai himself didn’t know why.

Since he was unwilling to speak, Yang Kai didn’t press the matter further.

“This thing is useless to me; you keep it well.” Meng Wuya spoke as he handed back the Wan Yao Ling Paste, then glanced thoughtfully at Earth Demon, chuckling, “Old Demon, you’re in luck. With this, perhaps you could break through to beyond the Divine Roaming Realm in one go.”

“Can this really help one break through the shackles beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?” Yang Kai’s face lit up with joy. Last time, Ling Taixu had used the Wan Yao Ling Paste to achieve his current level in one go, and he had thought it a mere coincidence. But now, with Meng Wuya’s words, he realized how precious the Wan Yao Ling Paste truly was.

“This substance contains hidden Heavenly Dao principles and is very powerful in breaking bottlenecks. Old Demon already has a foundation; if with this he still cannot break through, then he might as well just commit suicide.”

Earth Demon chuckled and quickly treasured the small piece of Wan Yao Ling Paste as if it were a priceless treasure.

“How long did this take to form?” Meng Wuya gave Yang Kai a glance.

“About five or six thousand years,” Yang Kai answered truthfully.

“That’s right. Thousands of years of sediment… such a fine thing. Too bad my sealing cannot be fully broken with this.” Meng Wuya sighed.

“Then use this.” Yang Kai took out some Wan Yao Ling Ye.

Meng Wuya examined it carefully, exclaiming, “This isn’t bad either. Though not as pure and refined as the other, it is still a rare good substance, best for recovering from injuries. Hmm… this thing might even help cleanse one’s meridians and marrow.”

“Shopkeeper Meng has sharp vision.” Yang Kai gave a thumbs-up.

Meng Wuya snorted lightly, “Does the old man lack even this bit of discernment? Where did you get it from, and how much do you have left?”

Yang Kai sniffed and casually gave a number.

The three almost lost their composure, staring wide-eyed at Yang Kai.

“Give some to my disciple. Though this thing is useless to me, it will greatly benefit Ning Shang.” Meng Wuya immediately barked, showing no politeness.

“I gave it long ago.”

Shopkeeper Meng suddenly understood, “No wonder Ning Shang’s strength has improved so rapidly these past year or two. So that’s the reason. The mystery-grade pills taken by our faction’s warriors probably also contain this substance?”

“Yes.”

Ling Taixu shook his head bitterly, “The Yang Family has really shot themselves in the foot this time.”

If they knew Yang Kai possessed so much Wan Yao Ling Ye, they might regret ignoring and indirectly coercing him.

If the Yang Family treated Yang Kai properly instead of constantly talking about destroying his cultivation and labeling him an evil disciple, Yang Kai, with such immense resources, would have shared benefits with the Yang Family gladly.

His resources were so vast that even with all his friends and kin combined, they could never be used up in a lifetime. Enhancing the family’s strength would be nothing but a pleasure for him.

Yet the Yang Family’s behaviors forcibly pushed such a powerful asset into their opposition, driving Yang Kai to resist.

After leaving Meng Wuya’s room, Yang Kai first went to visit Qiu Yimeng.

Miss Qiu was no longer in serious condition. The wound she inflicted on herself wasn’t deep, and after Su Yan’s care, she’d almost fully recovered.

When he told her of his decision to leave, Qiu Yimeng merely showed a bitter expression but did not oppose it. Given the current situation, Yang Kai leaving was truly the best choice.

“Go gather everyone. I have something to say,” Yang Kai calmly ordered.

Qiu Yimeng was momentarily stunned but instantly understood his intent and nodded quietly before going out to summon everyone.

Though she had once left Yang Kai’s residence yesterday morning and returned at night leading an attack, at the last moment everyone understood her difficulties and no longer held grudges against her or Huo Xingchen. Instead, there was some sympathy.

Forced to oppose, who could truly understand the hardship in their hearts?

Qiu Yimeng remained the second most powerful figure in the mansion; no one could shake her position.

In the side hall, the leaders of all forces had gathered. Every face wore a hint of sadness; even usually irreverent Huo Xingchen was serious.

All awaited quietly.

After a long moment, Yang Kai stood and spoke: “The Succession War has now lasted nearly ten months. I thank everyone for their support and efforts over this time. Though at times we came close to victory, various matters caused us to repeatedly fail at the finish line. Now, the Succession War is no longer the Succession War, and I myself do not intend to continue. In a few days, I will leave here, disappointing everyone’s hopes.”

No one spoke. They simply looked at him quietly.

Everyone knew that Yang Kai’s choice was made out of necessity.

“As I said before, staying with me means making enemies of the Zhongdu Eight Great Families, endangering your sects and families! Before, I was unsure and only warned you, but after last night, my worries are proven true. Now, this situation is no longer for you to decide. I hope you all seriously consider your sects and families’ welfare and decide if you should stay here. If you wish to leave now, I won’t stop you, and will compensate as much as possible for your losses. The Alchemy Room and the Refining Chamber have accrued quite some surplus to distribute.”

He fell silent, waiting.

All eyes fixed on him, but no one spoke or showed intention to leave.

Yang Kai sneered, “I’ve decided to leave and not participate in the Succession War anymore. What are you still waiting for? Parting here does not mean we are forever apart. We’ll still be friends in the future, this is not life or death farewells.”

His expression hardened as he said, “To speak plainly, if you stay here, you will only endanger the safety of your sects and families. Severing ties with me now is your wisest choice. I am not trying to threaten you—this is simply the truth. I have shown kindness to many of you, but through these ten months of hardship and shared struggle, you have already repaid it in full. Now, none of us owes the other anything, so there is no need for any burden on your hearts.”

Dong Qinghan suddenly laughed, “Why so cold? You said the choice is ours. We will leave when the time’s right. As for owing, I think no one owes anyone here. Our forces have suffered losses coming here, but… who hasn’t gained more? Those still standing would not have their current cultivation if not for the faction’s Mystery Grade Pills. Without them, it might take years of effort just to reach this level. Everyone alive now has at least three Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures, a treatment few first-rate families can provide.”

“We’re relatives; you have no say,” Yang Kai glanced at him.

Dong Qinghan rolled his eyes lightly, muttering, “I’m not defending you.”

“What Young Master Dong says is what I think as well,” Han Xiao Qi smiled gently, her gaze burning fiercely on Yang Kai. “I have a say, don’t I?”

Yang Kai sighed, “I’m not driving you away… it’s just that now—”

“We understand,” Han Xiao Qi interrupted, realizing his difficulty. Before she could say more, shouts came from outside the mansion.

“All members of Yang Kai’s residence, listen carefully! You aid evil and serve wickedness, an unforgivable crime. However, taking into account your youth and inexperience, Miss Ye is willing to offer you a chance for redemption. If you abandon darkness and surrender under Miss Ye’s banner, past grievances will be forgiven. If you persist in misguided ways, then you make enemies of the Zhongdu Eight Great Families, and you will bear the consequences!”

Her voice rang like a bell, spreading throughout War City. Everyone inside heard it clearly.

Over and over the call was repeated.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted strangely. He sneered, “Ye Xinrou is quite interesting, playing this game.”

He was already prepared to leave — who knew the final act would still provide good entertainment.

“This is coercion,” Huo Xingchen shook his head. Ye Xinrou’s shout might indeed shake some hearts.

Consequences—what kind of consequences?

Yang Kai had said: those consequences relate to the families and sects behind them.

Some in the crowd hesitated, their expressions troubled.

Not everyone could swear to stand with Yang Kai no matter what, and even if they chose to leave now, Yang Kai himself wouldn’t feel any position to blame them.

“Young Master,” someone suddenly called out.

Yang Kai looked over and saw Liu Feisheng from Tianyuan City, who indicated with a calm expression, “Say what you need, Young Master Liu.”

“I, from Tianyuan City, will leave here!” Liu Feisheng’s face flushed violently, his expression fraught with difficulty.

“A wise choice,” Yang Kai lightly nodded, offering no mockery, only a plain tone: “Thank you, Young Master Liu, and all from Tianyuan City for your efforts. Bring the stuff up.”

Several Lingxiao Pavilion disciples stepped out from the side, each holding a tray as they approached Liu Feisheng.

“Here are ten bottles of Mystery Grade Pills and five secret treasures. A small token of thanks from Yang Kai. Please accept them.”

“This…” Liu Feisheng hesitated, never expecting Yang Kai to still offer gifts at the last moment.

He had thought he would be met first with cold mockery and then cast out.
