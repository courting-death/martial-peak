## Chapter 1542 — Freak

Previously, Yang Yan also said that the Emperor had forged ten Star Emperor Tokens in total, and each one sealed a divine technique belonging to the Emperor.

Now she wanted him to keep it safe himself—could it be that this Star Emperor Token still concealed some hidden mystery?

However, no matter what was concealed inside, it probably required all ten pieces to reveal it.

But gathering them was easier said than done. Since entering the Star Domain, so many years had passed, and through countless chances and coincidences, he himself had only four pieces — where the other six had gone, only heaven knew.

The only thing Yang Kai knew was that the Hengluo Commerce Guild possessed one on the main star, Shuiyue Star—something he’d learned by chance back when he was chatting with Xue Yue.

He didn’t dwell on it; after carefully stowing away the fourth Star Emperor Token, he had Ye Xijun send word to Qian Tong, Fei Zhi Tu and the Qiantian Sect to tell them the time had come, then left the hall.

Three years ago, Yang Kai had already planned to sail afar.

If not for what had happened before, he would likely already be deep within the Star Domain by now.

Because of the provocation from Star Emperor Mountain, his plans had been delayed. Now that he was free again, it was finally time to set sail—to seek the road home and to search for the beloved who had drifted somewhere across the vast Star Domain.

On his way to Tianyi Palace, Su Yan’s face flashed before Yang Kai’s eyes, and his gaze softened.

Since parting on Tongxuan Continent, more than twenty years had passed in the blink of an eye…

Those twenty years had seen wind and rain; his cultivation had climbed from the Saint Realm to the Origin Returning Realm, a strength more than a hundred times greater than when he had recklessly plunged into the Star Domain.

But the Martial Dao has no summit; the higher Yang Kai climbed, the more he discovered his shortcomings.

He was eager to grow stronger, to scale the pinnacle of the Martial Dao, to stand atop the peak and look down upon the myriad living!

Cheers and shouts came to his ears, pulling him out of his reverie. Turning his head he saw a crowd gathered over there, apparently making a great fuss about something.

These people were all disciples of the Haike Family back then. They had left the family with Wu Yi and had been following Yang Kai ever since.

Although their cultivation levels had once been uneven, over the years, with abundant cultivation resources and a good environment, each of them had advanced by leaps and bounds; most had already reached the Saint King Realm!

Yu Feng and Wu Yi were each only one step away from breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm.

Training at the Lingxiao Sect, provided one’s aptitude wasn’t too poor, breakthroughs were hardly a concern: various spiritual pills and wondrous medicines assisted, the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense of Ascension Dragon Hall removed distracting inner demons, and the Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree helped practitioners perceive the Heavenly and Martial Dao.

Each warrior felt no great difficulty when breaking through; everything proceeded naturally.

At this moment, over twenty people were gathered, watching and shouting at the center of the ring.

It seemed two people were sparring, the sounds of fists and feet colliding coming repeatedly.

Disciples sharpened their strength through sparring and examined their shortcomings; this was a good thing. Yang Kai smiled faintly and hadn’t intended to join the commotion. But when his gaze casually fell upon one of the figures sparring, he couldn’t help but utter a small sound of surprise and hurried over.

The crowd’s attention was fixed on the fight, so Yang Kai’s arrival did not alarm anyone.

In the ring indeed two were sparring, but contrary to Yang Kai’s expectation, they were not contending with secret techniques or secret treasures, nor displaying Saint Yuan; they were simply testing strength and reflexes in close-quarters hand-to-hand combat!

One of them, Yang Kai found familiar but could not name, was a burly man with a solid, muscular frame; clearly a man of brute strength whose cultivation was not weak — First Stage of the Saint King Realm!

What caught Yang Kai’s attention was the burly man’s opponent.

It turned out to be a little girl!

She looked no more than ten years old, a tiny body yet as agile as an ape, darting and flipping at the man’s side, her movements astonishingly swift.

Her hair was a light yellow, tied casually with two ribbons that hung over her shoulders; her features were delicate and cute, and as she tumbled a stray lock of hair floated with her movements.

Though young, she already had the makings of a beauty.

While evading the man’s attacks she always found opportunities to land small fists on various parts of his body.

Those seemingly light punches contained astonishing power; a man of that build would tremble from even a single blow, grimacing in pain for a long while.

Yang Kai noticed the man’s eyes were bruised and blackened — clearly the result of blows landed by the little girl.

The man’s blows showed no mercy; each powerful punch whistled through the air, making Yang Kai fear the little girl might not withstand them and be smashed to pieces.

But his worry was needless. None of the onlookers felt concern for the girl; instead they shouted and jeered, some mocking the man’s weakness and others cheering the girl on; the scene was lively.

"Lin Yun’er?" Yang Kai suddenly recognized the little girl.

She was the young girl he had once brought back from Haicheng City.

She was the one Huang Juan had adopted.

When he brought her back she had only been seven or eight years old; three years had passed, and she was roughly this age now.

Yang Kai had long known Lin Yun’er’s small body could unleash great force, but seeing her now he realized he had underestimated her potential.

Only ten years old, she already surpassed that First Stage Saint King man in sheer physical contest, even outmatching him somewhat; otherwise he would not have fallen into the disadvantage.

What a freak! Yang Kai clicked his tongue in amazement.

As he watched her with interest, the little girl flashed, slipped beneath the man’s crotch, then leapt high and delivered a beautiful uppercut that struck the man’s jaw and sent him flying.

Thud…

The man crashed to the ground, face flushed, and after struggling for a long while managed to crawl up in a sorry state.

The onlookers laughed heartily, and among them Yu Feng laughed the loudest.

Having defeated his opponent, Lin Yun’er seemed very pleased; she jumped up excitedly, shouting and clamoring.

Yang Kai looked at her, a thoughtful expression appearing in his eyes.

If it were truly a life-or-death fight, the little girl definitely would not stand a chance against that man — the cultivation gap was simply too great. But in a contest of agility and physical strength alone, she held an absolute advantage.

She was only ten and overflowing with potential; if taught according to her talent, her future achievements would be boundless!

Interesting. Very interesting! Yang Kai’s interest was immediately piqued.

"Eh, you’re that uncle!" Lin Yun’er suddenly discovered Yang Kai and pointed at him, calling out.

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

"Ah, the Sect Master!" Yu Feng cried out as he turned his head, hastily covering his eyes as if hiding something, his gaze evasive.

Yang Kai glanced around and found that most gathered here had bruised eyes and looked ashamed.

"All knocked down?" Yang Kai clicked his tongue in wonder.

"Heh…" Yu Feng was mortified, wishing he could crawl into a hole.

He was, after all, at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, only one step from breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm, yet in a contest with Lin Yun’er he had accidentally taken one of her punches and ended up like this.

This was the greatest shame of his life…

"Truly embarrassing." Yang Kai curled his lips and beckoned to Lin Yun’er, "Yun’er, come here."

The girl was obedient and quickly walked to Yang Kai. After a moment she chirped, "Disciple Lin Yun’er greets the Sect Master… Uncle!"

"Hm." Yang Kai nodded, showing a harmless smile. "That last word you can skip next time."

"Yes!" the girl nodded.

Ye Xijun had done a good job teaching her, Yang Kai thought as he looked at the girl, greatly pleased. After bringing her back he had placed her under Ye Xijun’s instruction, and now she was so sensible — clearly Ye Xijun deserved the credit.

"Do you like it here?" Yang Kai asked kindly.

"I like it!" Lin Yun’er replied at once. "There’s food, no one bullies Yun’er, Aunt Ye and the other uncles and elders are all good to Yun’er."

"Good that you like it." Yang Kai grinned. "Has Aunt Ye found you a master?"

Lin Yun’er shook her head slowly.

"Why not?" Yang Kai was surprised.

Although young, Lin Yun’er was clearly a rare prodigy; Yang Kai found it hard to imagine that the people of Star Emperor Mountain wouldn’t fight to take her as a disciple.

They were strict in taking disciples, but Lin Yun’er certainly met the requirements; that no one had taken her on was strange.

"Aunt Ye said no one there can teach me," Lin Yun’er replied in a clear voice, tilting her head with delight. "Yun’er now cultivates by Aunt Ye’s side and doesn’t need to formally apprentice to another master."

"Indeed, your Aunt Ye’s strength is extraordinary; training under her will suit you well!"

"Yes!"

"Hm, you all continue then!" Yang Kai waved and turned to leave.

Farewell calls followed behind him, but Yang Kai fell into thought.

Ye Xijun had said no one could teach Lin Yun’er — that was odd.

Although the warriors of Star Emperor Mountain numbered only around two hundred, each had their own domains of expertise; finding someone among these elites to instruct Lin Yun’er shouldn’t be a problem.

Since Ye Xijun said this, there was only one possibility.

She valued Lin Yun’er highly and did not want her to be taught sloppily; she probably intended to teach Lin Yun’er the best herself.

This matter had to be asked of Ye Xijun; Yang Kai was curious why a girl so young had such astonishing strength.

Having spent three years with her, Ye Xijun should know.

Lost in thought, Yang Kai returned to Tianyi Palace.

No sooner had he stepped into the hall than a low, distant dragon’s roar came from deep within, and a green light shot out.

Yang Kai grinned and, with a beckoning hand, caught the green light in his palm.

As the light faded, it revealed a leaf-green long sword with neither edge nor point.

Dragon Bone Sword — Dripping Jade!

A sense of spiritual connection and mingled bloodline arose; the green dragon remnant soul that swam along the blade seemed even more joyful.

After three years apart, the Dragon Bone Sword’s aura seemed stronger; after all, in the battles three years ago Yang Kai had slain many, and the sword had devoured much flesh and essence.

Three years of accumulation could indeed cause some change.
