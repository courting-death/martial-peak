## Chapter 1234 — Continuing Deeper

Not long after, Yang Kai came to her side. After a period of recuperation, Daiyuan's spirit had recovered considerably; when Yang Kai approached she happened to open her eyes, clearly sensing him, yet she wore an expression as if she wanted to speak but held back, which greatly piqued Yang Kai's curiosity.

"Junior Brother Yang, my restorative pills are used up—do you have any spare? I can pay with Saint Crystals," Daiyuan said, a faint flicker passing through her lovely eyes as she spoke.

Yang Kai didn't pay this much mind. Although he found it odd that the woman had exhausted her restorative pills, he reasoned she likely hadn't expected to reach the Third Layer and thus had consumed her supplies more recklessly.

So he had no suspicions and pulled a bottle of pills from his Spatial Ring, tossing it to her with a slight smile. "Keep the Saint Crystals; a single bottle of pills is nothing, not worth any trouble."

Daiyuan accepted it with a trace of gratitude, nodding. "Then Daiyuan thanks Junior Brother Yang."

"Mm, let us continue on our way." Yang Kai said, taking the lead and setting off.

After Yang Kai left, Daiyuan quickly opened the bottle, glanced inside, and upon seeing the pills within her delicate body trembled and her face lit with wild joy.

When she raised her head to gaze at Yang Kai's retreating figure, her beautiful eyes sparkled with excitement and ardor. She quietly put the pills away and hurried to follow.

The Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone was indeed countless times more perilous than the First Layer's; though similar in nature, the dangers concealed within were not comparable.

When Yang Kai had traversed the First Layer he had, aside from an encounter in that strange valley where he was beset by numerous Fire Spirit Beasts and expended some effort to dispel them, essentially strolled through without burden, penetrating into the Second Layer without even needing to activate his Saint Yuan for protection.

But within the Third Layer, Yang Kai had to constantly use his Saint Yuan to shield his body against the heat waves and fire toxins. Moreover, the Fire Spirit Beasts here were higher in rank—Seventh-Tier and Eighth-Tier—and besides those leaping from underground fissures there were various strange seals and formations.

The Fire Spirit Beasts posed little threat to Yang Kai and Daiyuan as individuals; as long as their numbers weren't overwhelming, the two of them together could cut them down and harvest some Crystal Stones.

Ever since witnessing the ancient seal that had ensnared Wei Guchang and the others, Yang Kai had become more wary of seemingly dangerous spots, avoiding them when possible and only covertly using his World-Ending Demon Eye to check for risk when escape wasn't feasible.

As they proceeded, Yang Kai's heart raced with dread.

Were it not for his innate World-Ending Demon Eye that could pierce illusion, in these past days he and Daiyuan would have fallen into at least five formations; those formations were concealed to an extreme degree, beyond the notice of Saint King Realm cultivators, and once triggered Yang Kai suspected the outcome would be grim.

Because Yang Kai had been secretly using the World-Ending Demon Eye to guide them past those dangers, the woman from Liuli Gate never noticed; she only privately found the Third Layer's Heat-Flame Zone somewhat overrated.

Unaware of the real peril, she followed Yang Kai with ease.

Though the World-Ending Demon Eye was a Great Demon God's innate divine art, Yang Kai had obtained and refined it later, so it was not omnipotent.

Once, the two of them slipped into a formation Yang Kai himself had failed to detect. When the formation triggered the surroundings shifted—what had been an inferno turned into bone-piercing cold, gusts howling like wailing ghosts swept past, and even large snowflakes drifted from the sky.

The environment abruptly became the polar opposite of before.

Strange ice spears formed and hurled from all directions, wind dragons of concentrated gale circled, and from their mouths blasted freezing qi sufficient to encase a body—hidden in wind blades, the utmost cold struck with cunning lethality and proved difficult to cope with.

Fortunately, both Yang Kai and Daiyuan were alchemists—one cultivated a Yang attribute method and the other a Fire attribute—so their Saint Yuan inherently resisted that formation.

Still, it cost them two or three days to forcefully break the formation and escape.

During the ordeal Daiyuan was injured; had Yang Kai not rescued her at a critical moment her wounds would have been far worse. In such places, wounded and unable to advance or retreat, one might as well be waiting to die.

After that incident Daiyuan no longer underestimated the Third Layer's guile and danger, and she followed Yang Kai cautiously.

Yang Kai was also wounded, but compared to his recovery ability those injuries were trivial. Once free of the formation he led Daiyuan to a cliff and carved a cave in which the two of them, like injured beasts, silently licked their wounds.

Three days later, Daiyuan's wounds healed and the pair resumed their journey.

The methods Yang Kai displayed and the force of his combat convinced Daiyuan that this First Stage Saint King was truly unlike those she had met before; his real fighting power was by no means inferior to hers, and his array of techniques were beyond her capacity to match, not to mention those abilities he had yet to reveal.

No wonder someone as arrogant as Wei Guchang treated him politely—perhaps that man long ago recognized Yang Kai's extraordinary nature.

Along the way they occasionally encountered several extremely rare fire-attributed spiritual herbs and medicines with fully matured medicinal age.

At those times Daiyuan would volunteer to harvest them using the most appropriate techniques and preserve them in the best possible manner.

For some reason, Yang Kai noticed the woman seemed very interested in these herbs; after each harvest she would chatter ceaselessly about their attributes, formulations, methods of refining medicinal essence, and the use of spirit formations in alchemy, as if she knew everything—she was utterly unabashed and different from her usual taciturn self.

Yang Kai remained silent and simply listened.

Under other circumstances he would have liked to discuss alchemy with Daiyuan—he could see she was skilled in the art though not ranked as highly as he was, and communication would be beneficial.

Regrettably, he was preoccupied with refining the Profound Yin Moon Water and had no mood for such conversations, missing the opportunity to exchange alchemical techniques with her.

Yang Kai's silence left Daiyuan somewhat disappointed; she began to wonder if things were not as she had assumed—otherwise why would Yang Kai be mute about these herbs and show no excitement?

She even deliberately misstated some information about the herbs to see if Yang Kai would correct her, but he offered no correction, which left her feeling uncertain.

Daiyuan did not hoard the herbs she gathered; she understood that without Yang Kai she could not have traveled so safely, so when distributing the harvest she kept a small portion for herself and gave most to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai did not refuse; they had no deep friendship beyond this journey into the Third Layer, and he accepted the gifts with a clear conscience.

After delving deeper into the Third Layer for about ten days, Daiyuan began to falter with each step.

The surrounding intense heat felt like repeated attacks of fire, battering her delicate body. Even with protective armor and the Rainbow Handkerchief unfurled into a pink veil enveloping her, Daiyuan was drenched in fragrant sweat, her clothes clinging tightly and outlining her exquisite figure.

If not for the Rainbow Handkerchief shielding her form, she might have exposed herself completely. Fortunately there were only the two of them, and Yang Kai walked ahead with no intention of looking back.

Nearly every step forward cost her tremendous effort; her delicate body trembled and a faint black vapor hovered about her.

It was the unique fire poison found only within the Flowing Flame Sandland. Daiyuan was unable to completely resist it and had already been slightly invaded by the toxin. If she went any deeper, her condition would likely worsen.

At this point Daiyuan secretly considered retreat, regretting having ventured so far.

Yet she had her reasons for staying silent—after more than ten days within the Third Layer, retreat now might not guarantee a safe withdrawal; she found herself stuck between options.

She could only steel herself and follow Yang Kai in silence.

Yang Kai, though not enduring as much, was also uncomfortable—his skin burned as if scorched, heat waves and fire toxins pressed in from all sides, making him feel on the verge of being shattered.

Were it not for his vast reserve of Saint Yuan he too would have had to find a place to recuperate.

Leading the way, Yang Kai's Divine Sense constantly monitored Daiyuan's movements; her faltering steps did not escape his perception, yet he did not rashly intervene.

This harsh environment was precisely the kind that tempered the purity and solidity of one's Saint Yuan, bringing great benefit to a cultivator.

Shielding her from the heat and fire toxin would have been a trivial gesture, but to deprive her of such an opportunity to strengthen herself would have been a greater loss.

They pressed deeper step by step; their pace crawled compared to previous days, and the deeper they went the worse the environment became.

A hint of excitement began to show in Yang Kai's eyes—he needed this kind of heat and wished for the place to become even more severe.

He calculated that based on recent observations and the changes deeper within, another five days' travel inward would place them at a suitable spot to begin refining the Profound Yin Moon Water.

Only the matter of what to do with the woman trailing him remained troublesome.
