## Chapter 1472 — Desolate Isle

Yang Kai was greatly surprised that the stele which contained the Artifact Refining Dao actually concealed something else.

By contrast, the pale Xue Yue suddenly showed a look of mingled surprise and delight when she saw the object, her beautiful eyes fixed unflinchingly on the stone token in Yang Kai's hand.

"Yang Kai, give me that thing!" Xue Yue suddenly shouted at him.

"On what grounds?" Yang Kai glanced at her, then hurriedly tucked the stone token into his Spatial Ring. He did not know exactly what lay within that token, but since it had been concealed so carefully, it must be extraordinary.

And Xue Yue should know something about it; she could even recognize those three ancient characters, otherwise she would not have reacted so excitedly.

"Give it to me!" Xue Yue cried desperately. "That thing is useless to you!"

"How do you know it's useless to me?" Yang Kai replied indifferently.

"Give it to me first; I'll explain later if I have the chance. Give that thing to me and I will withdraw from this matter forever—I will no longer trouble you or them, and our enmity will be erased." Xue Yue looked at Yang Kai with a face of earnest sincerity.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; his curiosity deepened.

What on earth could it be that would make Xue Yue yield so readily? Though the secret concealed within that stone token was clearly immense and valuable beyond measure, Yang Kai had no reason to suspect her of lying.

If she said it was useless to him, then it probably truly was. Xue Yue, despite her strong possessiveness and capability, was not the sort to lie—she esteemed herself highly, and such people scorn pettiness like deception.

On that point, Yang Kai trusted his own judgment.

Frankly speaking, exchanging an unknown stone token for Xue Yue's promise was not a bad bargain.

Seeing Yang Kai's look of wavering, Xue Yue hurried to press her advantage, saying, "My word, once spoken, cannot be taken back. You needn't doubt me—everyone here can bear witness!"

"May I ask what this thing is used for?" Yang Kai tilted his head and looked toward her.

Xue Yue's face showed a trace of difficulty. After a long moment she parted her red lips and transmitted her words silently: "I cannot tell you exactly what it does, but I can tell you this: that thing is useless to you, and it is useless to me as well. It is useless to all the cultivators inside the Imperial Garden!"

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed.

Although Xue Yue had not stated it outright, her words were already full of implication.

Most of the cultivators who entered the Imperial Garden were Origin Returning Realm practitioners, and there were even some Third Stage existences among them. If that stone token was useless to them all, then there was only one explanation.

Only a Void King Realm expert could possibly make use of that stone token!

Its value was indeed considerable—no wonder Xue Yue was willing to make such a promise. Something that only Void King-Grade experts could employ was of incalculable worth. However... he had only just advanced to the Origin Returning Realm; the Void King Realm lay far in the distance. Besides, he had many treasures and a solid foundation at hand—he might not even prize whatever secret lay inside that stone token.

With that in mind, Yang Kai calculated to himself, then looked up at Xue Yue and said, "Can I trust your words?"

"You can!" Xue Yue answered seriously.

"Very well, I hope you keep your promise." Yang Kai inclined his head slightly and was about to toss the stone token to Xue Yue when an anomalous change occurred.

A sudden, abnormal wave of energy swept through the area like an invisible ripple, passing over the ground where everyone stood.

Yang Kai was extremely familiar with this rippling energy; the instant he sensed it his face changed. He rushed toward Shan Qingluo, calling out in a low voice, "Qingluo!"

The Enchantress Queen had not yet realized what was happening. Seeing Yang Kai rush over with such urgency, she could not help but purse her lips in a slight smile and extend a jade hand toward him.

But in the next instant her expression altered—behind Yang Kai a gigantic hand formed from gathered Spiritual Qi suddenly manifested. The hand seemed to belong to a woman; though enormous, it gave an impression of slender, exquisite beauty, as if that flawless loveliness had been magnified countless times.

It came crashing down upon Yang Kai!

"No!" Shan Qingluo's face drained of color as she screamed.

Before she could finish, the delicate jade palm had already clutched Yang Kai's body; with the palm's shattering, Yang Kai vanished from before her eyes.

Before she could understand what had happened, screams erupted from all directions. Looking around, Shan Qingluo was stunned—everyone present had suffered the same fate as Yang Kai. Gigantic hands formed of Spiritual Qi gripped each person, shattered, and the power of space heaved; one by one, figures disappeared before their eyes.

Shan Qingluo instinctively looked up at the sky and found that she, too, had been affected in the same way...

When she recovered, she discovered with a start that she had been returned to Yao Star Di Chen!

On Dark Star, at a certain location, Yang Kai stood stunned in place, staring down at his own palm.

At his fingertips there still seemed to linger Shan Qingluo's warmth; the scent of that enchantress's body still hovered at his nose, making Yang Kai feel a touch of wistfulness.

After a long while he raised his head and sighed softly. Although they had only just reunited and were again forced apart, at least Shan Qingluo was living in comfort—this was more than enough.

He did not know what had occurred inside the Imperial Garden, but some strange law of heaven and earth had suddenly spat him back out. If he had been ejected, then certainly the others had been as well.

Thinking this, Yang Kai looked up and saw the massive, imposing Imperial Garden still hung in the sky as usual; only the jade teleport platform that had appeared before was gone.

He estimated that reentering the Imperial Garden would likely be impossible.

Yang Kai did not know exactly what catastrophe had befallen the Imperial Garden, but it should be related to Yang Yan. She had once said that on the day the Imperial Garden opened, it would awaken the Emperor's main body—had things gone smoothly for her and Ye Xijun?

If all had gone well, then the Emperor's main body should have already awakened!

At that thought Yang Kai's heart gave a jolt and his face suddenly darkened.

Yang Yan was a fragment of the Emperor's soul incarnation; if the Emperor's main body had awakened, what would become of her? He had never considered this before, and Yang Yan had not told him, but the more he thought the more uneasy he felt.

Without further hesitation, Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense to probe his surroundings and to ascertain the direction toward the Flowing Flame Sandland.

The results of that probe made his expression even grimmer.

He discovered that he was standing on a desolate island. The isle was small—only about ten or so li across—poorly provisioned, with almost no Spiritual Herbs or Medicines, and without any sign of living people. All around was the boundless sea, its waves glittering in the sun.

Could it be? Yang Kai frowned deeply.

When one is unlucky even drinking water brings a splinter—could he have been sent to the Wuyou Sea?

Yang Kai had been on Dark Star for some years and knew of the vast, boundless Wuyou Sea. One of the three great forbidden areas, Ghost Isle, lay within the Wuyou Sea; alas, no one had ever truly seen Ghost Isle—or those who had were dead.

His present surroundings matched the descriptions he had heard of the Wuyou Sea.

If that were indeed the case, it would be troublesome; the Flowing Flame Sandland lay far from the Wuyou Sea, and even if he flew back on his own it would take who knew how long.

Of course, this was only conjecture; to be certain of his location he would have to ask someone.

With that thought he summoned his Star Shuttle and darted away from the desolate isle at lightning speed.

Over the boundless ocean five cultivators dressed in matching uniforms were engaged in combat with a gigantic sea beast the size of an octopus; secret treasures and martial skills flared, and the battle was fierce.

The five were not particularly powerful—only of Saint Realm cultivation.

The octopus emitted an aura no higher than the peak of the Seventh-Tier.

In other circumstances the five Saint-Realm cultivators could have easily dispatched the beast, but at sea the creature enjoyed the home advantage: it could draw on abundant water Spiritual Qi to fight, forming ranks of water arrows that swept toward the five, interspersed with globules of murky, dark-green filth.

The beast's long, thick tentacles were not to be underestimated either; each lash forced the five to change color and scramble for cover.

Although the sea beast's wounds increased with time, the five were also severely taxed and were panting from exhaustion.

After the time it takes a stick of incense to burn, a shrill scream rang out—from a green-robed woman among the five. She and her companions had been so focused on slaying the Xuanjing Ink-Octopus that they had failed to notice the surrounding space becoming shrouded in a heavy mist.

The foul vapor was clearly discharged by the Xuanjing Ink-Octopus. This mist not only hindered the penetration of Divine Sense but also damaged the Spiritual Qi of secret treasures and disrupted the circulation of Saint Yuan within cultivators' bodies.

The woman, being the weakest in cultivation, was affected first. As soon as she sensed her Saint Yuan faltering, one of the beast's tentacles lashed out toward her.

Her face blanched; she tried to defend herself but was powerless. As the tentacle drew nearer she shrieked, certain this time she would not escape her fate.

The other four likewise turned pale, but in such a situation none could come to her aid; each felt a rage that split them apart, wishing they could be in two places at once.

At that moment, a streak of golden light suddenly flashed into view. Though faint, it shone like the most dazzling sun and instantly dispersed the surrounding inky green haze.

With a soft ripping sound, the tentacle of the Xuanjing Ink-Octopus that had rendered the five helpless was cleanly severed, spraying out dark-green blood.

The sea beast howled in pain; in its agony its countless tentacles lashed about wildly like massive whips, churning the nearby waters into chaos.

The golden light reappeared with sizzling sounds, cutting through all the creature's tentacles; by inertia they were flung far away and the emerald blood instantly filled the sea surface.
