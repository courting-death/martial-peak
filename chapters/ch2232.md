## Chapter 2232 — Captured

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Yang Kai’s figure flickered left and right, agile to the extreme. With Spatial Divine Ability empowering him, he kept teleporting instantly.

Yet he still couldn’t shake off the approaching Fangtian halberd.

This halberd clung to him like a maggot on bone, shadowing his every move, and the distance between it and Yang Kai kept shrinking.

In this moment of crisis, Yang Kai could no longer care about anything else. His pure Divine Soul power burst forth, transforming into a violent attack to meet the long halberd, hoping to block it for a moment.

Boom…

A thunderous sound rang out. Yang Kai’s whole body trembled, his face instantly paling, while the Fangtian halberd remained unmoved, slanting down from the sky.

Even with all his strength, Yang Kai’s strike couldn’t stop it in the slightest.

The next moment, the Fangtian halberd crashed to the ground not far from Yang Kai, its shaft sinking deep into the earth. As it pierced the ground, a clearly visible ripple spread out from the point of impact, roaring in all directions.

In just a single breath, a ten-li radius was bound and sealed by an invisible force. That power was fierce and domineering, supremely mighty, making Yang Kai feel a despair he could not resist.

He tried to use Spatial Force to teleport again, but helplessly found that under the influence of that mysterious power, he couldn’t move at all—even his thoughts slowed down.

In his field of vision, Zhou Dian’s burly figure approached slowly, his face cold as ice.

In no time, he arrived before Yang Kai, looking down on him with disdain. With a cold snort, he said, “You’ve got some skill, brat, but… that’s all!”

As soon as he finished, he flicked his finger. A stream of energy shot from his fingertip, striking into Yang Kai’s body.

Yang Kai’s body went rigid. In an instant, he felt all his strength completely sealed—he couldn’t use even a trace.

It’s over!

Yang Kai’s face turned ashen. He’d known he probably couldn’t escape under the nose of a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, but only after being captured did he realize how insignificant he was.

If not for his spatial abilities, he’d have been unable to struggle long ago.

The Third Stage of the Emperor Realm was simply not something he could contend with now.

Zhou Dian beckoned with his hand. The Fangtian halberd embedded in the ground flew back to his grasp and was absorbed into his body.

This Divine Roaming Nation’s Grand General turned his head, glancing toward the direction of Heavenly Yao Valley, his expression shifting uncertainly. After a long sigh, full of endless regret, he grabbed Yang Kai and sped off toward the outside of Heavenly Yao Mountain.

He understood that since the King had acted personally, Yi Quan likely had no chance at all.

The King’s terror was something even he, a follower of many years, could not fathom.

If possible, Zhou Dian would have preferred to be the one to defeat Yi Quan, but this time, he clearly hadn’t gotten his wish.

Still… what intrigued him even more was what secret Yang Kai possessed that could make the King leave the palace and act in person. No matter how he looked at it, Yang Kai was just a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm martial artist, nothing particularly special. If anything, it was that this brat’s escape techniques were truly outstanding.

If he hadn’t tracked him himself, and Lian Yan had come instead, Yang Kai might really have gotten away.

“Brat… do you know why the King is looking for you?” Zhou Dian suddenly asked.

Yang Kai, still dejected, replied irritably, “Shouldn’t I be asking you that?”

Before he could finish, his body stiffened and pain twisted his face—Zhou Dian had struck him secretly, causing a soul-wrenching agony.

Realizing he was under another’s control, Yang Kai dared not act too arrogant. He could only say, "Senior, have you caught the wrong person? I heard you’re looking for some Calamity Stars. Look closely—do I look like one?"

"I only capture people; everything else is not my concern!" Zhou Dian replied coldly. After a pause, he continued, "I ask you, where is Ban Qing? You met him before, didn’t you? Why is he missing?"

“Ban Qing? You mean that short, sneaky guy?” Yang Kai feigned ignorance, making up a story: “Killed by a yao expert.”

Zhou Dian’s eyes flashed with a cold light, murderous intent nearly tangible, making Yang Kai’s whole body go cold.

But soon, Zhou Dian restrained his killing intent, snorted coldly, and said, “This debt will be settled sooner or later!”

He didn’t question Yang Kai further, nor did he suspect Ban Qing died by Yang Kai’s hand, as he thought that was impossible.

Only those yao experts could possibly kill Ban Qing.

Half an hour later, Zhou Dian brought Yang Kai back to their previous encampment.

By now, nearly all the human experts who had followed Zhou Dian into Heavenly Yao Mountain had gathered here: Yu Man, Yuan Qing, and even Lian Yan, who had previously escaped from Heavenly Yao Valley, were present. Only Ban Qing was missing.

Beside these people was a group of listless, helpless captives huddled together.

Seeing Zhou Dian return, everyone hurried forward to salute.

“Take everyone and return to the palace!” Zhou Dian ordered. The crowd responded in unison, and as he spoke, he casually tossed Yang Kai into the pile of captives.

Shen Muji discreetly supported Yang Kai, keeping him from falling, then gave him a slight nod.

Yang Kai glanced around and immediately spotted several other fellow sufferers. Their eyes met, and they couldn’t help but exchange bitter smiles.

No one could have imagined that after entering this Divine Roaming Mirror world to temper themselves for just a month, they would end up captured by the very natives of this place.

The group moved quickly. Less than ten breaths after Zhou Dian’s order, they set out toward Divine Roaming City.

Along the way, Yang Kai dared not exchange information with the others and could only remain silent.

Even now, he didn’t know why they had been captured, or what exactly the Calamity Star Ban Qing mentioned was…

But it was clear this matter was of great importance. Otherwise, there would have been no need to mobilize so many experts, or for Zhou Dian and that ghost-faced King to act personally.

Yang Kai faintly felt he had fallen into a massive whirlpool, unable to extricate himself.

…

One day later.

Heavenly Yao Valley.

Yi Quan sat cross-legged, circulating his energy to heal. His face flickered with divine light, while many yao experts looked on with concern, each standing guard around him.

Yesterday, Yi Quan had first fought Zhou Dian, then battled that ghost-faced man, exhausting himself greatly.

On top of that, he was wounded by Zhou Dian during the ghost-faced man’s sneak attack, and suffered multiple injuries in the final battle.

If not for the ghost-faced man’s strength being insufficient to crush Yi Quan, the master of Heavenly Yao Mountain would have lost his life long ago, and Heavenly Yao Valley would have ceased to exist!

Fortunately, the ghost-faced man’s goal this time seemed only to capture people, not to eradicate Heavenly Yao Valley. So after fighting Yi Quan, he withdrew on his own. Even so, Yi Quan’s injuries were not something that could heal quickly.

As he quietly healed, suddenly Bai Lu’s sharp cry rang out by his ear: “Who’s there!”

Yi Quan’s eyes snapped open, shining with light as he stared ahead.

There, an elderly man with white hair and beard strolled forward. The old man’s body showed no trace of energy, as if he were an ordinary person who had never cultivated.

No one knew where he had come from, but after arriving, he walked straight toward Yi Quan.

The yao experts could not stand by idly. At this critical moment in Yi Quan’s healing, he could not be disturbed. Whether this old man was friend or foe, he could not be allowed near.

So, after shouting, Bai Lu’s figure flickered, turning into a white light as she charged at the old man.

But to the shock of this First Stage Emperor Realm expert, though she had charged at the old man, when she reappeared, she found herself behind him.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

Countless yao experts moved in response, all trying to block the old man’s advance.

Not a single one succeeded.

Every expert who charged at the old man froze in place, eyes wide as if witnessing something terrifying.

None of them saw the old man make a move, yet all failed.

The old man’s steps were unhurried, but in the blink of an eye, he stood before Yi Quan, lowering his head to gaze at him.

“You…” Yi Quan frowned, sizing up the newcomer with suspicion. But in the next moment, his eyes flashed with shock as if recalling something. “You are…?”

The old man raised his hand slightly, stopping Yi Quan from speaking further, then placed his seemingly withered hand on Yi Quan’s shoulder.

A stream of pure energy slowly poured into Yi Quan’s body.

As strong as Yi Quan was, he couldn’t help but show a look of comfort. Clearly, his injuries were easing under the nourishment of this energy.

After a while, the old man withdrew his hand.

Yi Quan was shocked to find that most of his injuries had healed, and the rest would recover with time, leaving no hidden dangers.

He stood up straight, respectfully cupped his fists to the old man, and said solemnly, “Junior Yi Quan thanks Senior for help!”

As soon as these words fell, Heavenly Yao Valley fell silent.

Countless yao experts stared at Yi Quan in shock, hardly believing what they heard.

In this world, Yi Quan was one of the most powerful and senior figures, yet before this human elder, he called himself junior.

Who was this old man? What was his status?

The yao were utterly dumbfounded.

“Since you recognize me, you should know why I’m here,” the old man finally spoke, looking intently at Yi Quan. “Where is it?”

Yi Quan showed a look of shame and replied, “It was taken away!”

The old man raised his eyebrows. “Who took it? Where was it taken?”

“Divine Roaming Nation, the royal palace!”

The old man nodded slightly. “It seems I’m still a step too late. No matter, I’ll make another trip!”

As soon as he finished, his figure blurred and faded. In just three breaths, he vanished from this world.

Yi Quan stood where he was, his face full of awe and longing. But soon, he couldn’t help but burst into loud laughter, his voice rolling like thunder throughout Heavenly Yao Valley, drawing the attention of countless yao.
