## Chapter 470 — So Many Mysterious People at the Estate

This bone shield was not large, roughly the size of a millstone, and it was unclear which Demonic Beast’s bone it was forged from. Its design was bizarre, shining inside and out with an ivory-like luster. Along the edges, sharp bone ridges stood upright, incredibly piercing. On the front of the shield was the image of a ferocious beast with a wide blood-red mouth.

The fierce beast’s face was blue, with fangs bared, terrifying to behold. Its angry eyes gawked as if it were about to choose someone to devour.

When Yang Kai first grasped it, he sensed a bloody and grim aura rushing from it, causing his heart to shudder.

Though its grade was inferior to the mirror he had obtained earlier, only a Mystery-Grade lower-level treasure, this bone shield was clearly a defensive secret treasure, so its value was not much lower than that mirror.

Secret treasures came in many varieties. Generally, defensive treasures were rarer than offensive ones, which greatly increased their value.

The three secret treasures he possessed were each more precious than the last. If he could refine all three, Yang Kai estimated his overall strength would significantly improve.

So far, he only had three secret treasures to use.

The Shura Sword, Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia, and the Locking Demon Chain.

The first two were Heaven-Grade level treasures. Having used them for so long, Yang Kai was sure they were Heaven-Grade upper-level. As the relics of a top-tier overseas Sect, their grades would not be low.

A first-tier Sect would also surely possess Mystery-Grade secret treasures, at least one. But the Shura Sword and Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia remained the Sect’s prized treasures, undoubtedly because they held special significance.

As for the Locking Demon Chain, its grade was unknown. After imprisoning the demonic master’s fragment of soul in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, the chain’s spirit had greatly diminished. Even now, Yang Kai was nurturing it with True Yuan, but it had yet to recover.

Having just obtained three high-quality secret treasures, Yang Kai naturally wanted to refine them immediately for his use.

After careful consideration, he first stowed away the Divine Soul Secret Treasure and the mirror, holding the bone shield in his hand. He circulated True Yuan, cultivating while refining it.

Pure and overwhelming True Yang Yuan Qi was poured unrestrictedly into the bone shield, greatly accelerating the refining process.

Since the day he returned from the treasure-snatching battle, Yang Kai had secluded himself in his room without venturing out. His Senior Sister did come back daily but never disturbed him—she quietly rested beside him, peaceful in demeanor.

Within the estate, the sorrow that once arose from personnel losses had gradually faded away. Members of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower quickly integrated into Yang Kai’s household, and the Hu sisters settled in comfortably, growing familiar with many young leaders from various forces.

The only irritant was that none of them had seen Yang Kai these past few days.

Not to mention them—even Qiu Yimeng, the estate’s second-in-command, found it extremely difficult to meet Yang Kai.

Yet everyone knew—Yang Kai was certainly refining newly acquired secret treasures.

Two days later, Qu Gaoyi, who guarded the hall outside the main chamber, was resting with eyes closed when a light breeze brushed past him.

Upon opening his eyes, he saw Ying Jiu gazing at him eagerly.

“Why aren’t you by the young master’s side? What brings you here?” Qu Gaoyi asked suspiciously.

Yang Kai’s safety was always Ying Jiu’s charge; he shadowed him closely without parting.

“The young master is in seclusion, and his safety… is of course assured,” Ying Jiu said, recalling the old man next door to Yang Kai without a hint of worry.

“Even so, you can’t be careless,” Qu Gaoyi began scolding.

“Never mind that,” Ying Jiu said with a sigh and a serious tone. “Old Qu, I met a master.”

“How strong?” Qu Gaoyi was shocked. The Blood Servants were already formidable. Not only were they born of the Yang Family, but also empowered with the Blood Fury Technique. As such, they had high standards and rarely admitted anyone.

“Very strong,” Ying Jiu replied succinctly as always.

“How strong exactly?” Qu Gaoyi rolled his eyes. Among brothers, he was casual in speech. Still, such praise from Ying Jiu meant the person must be powerful.

Curiosity piqued, Qu Gaoyi wanted to know more about the person who had struck such a blow to Ying Jiu emotionally.

“I estimate that if a fight broke out, either of us would be crushed in three moves,” Ying Jiu said gravely.

Qu Gaoyi’s mouth hung open. He had never heard such high praise from Ying Jiu before. After a long pause, he seriously asked, “What about if you unleash the Blood Fury Technique?”

“That wouldn’t help. At most ten moves!” Ying Jiu said.

“Beyond Divine Roaming Realm?” Qu Gaoyi asked incredulously.

“Peak of Divine Roaming!”

“Nonsense!” Qu Gaoyi spat saliva into Ying Jiu’s face.

Unfazed, Ying Jiu wiped his face and said solemnly, “It’s true.”

Qu Gaoyi gave Ying Jiu an odd look. No matter how he looked at him, he refused to believe it.

They had indeed met Divine Roaming Realm peak masters before. Among first-rate forces, there were masters at the peak Divine Roaming Realm. Even unleashing the Blood Fury Technique, both Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu had defeated such warriors before.

No matter how powerful a warrior was, there was always a limit. How could someone cut them down in ten moves even with their Blood Fury Technique unleashed?

The Blood Servants Hall master, Feng Sheng, did not even have such power. Feng Sheng was the strongest Divine Roaming Realm peak master Qu Gaoyi had ever met. There was no one stronger in the world.

“Look at me now,” Ying Jiu straightened and gestured.

“What about you?” Qu Gaoyi frowned but suddenly his expression changed to shock. “Your True Yuan is…”

He finally realized something was amiss.

“The Sealing Yuan Curse has been lifted. That master helped!” Ying Jiu said.

“Impossible!” Qu Gaoyi was thoroughly stunned.

Only two days had passed. How could the Sealing Yuan Curse be broken in such a strange way? But Ying Jiu’s True Yuan was indeed flowing freely through his meridians with no sign of restriction. Even if Qu Gaoyi did not want to believe it, he had to.

“So, who is it?” Qu Gaoyi finally got to the point.

Ying Jiu glanced around then beckoned him close, whispering in his ear.

“That old…” Qu Gaoyi was stunned. He already knew Meng Wuya was strong but had no idea he was this powerful.

“It’s him. I still feel somewhat dazed,” Ying Jiu shook his head repeatedly, struggling to accept the fact. Two days ago, he had called on Meng Wuya in desperation, hoping for a miracle. Now the effect was real.

Looking back, the old man had just poked him a few times casually and then taught him a breathing technique. Breathing in and out, Ying Jiu had roughly shattered the Sealing Yuan Curse.

It was so miraculous Ying Jiu thought he was dreaming.

Now he realized—what he said two days ago about himself having some knowledge of imprisonment techniques was no exaggeration. It wasn’t just some knowledge; it was profound mastery.

“Old Qu, I realize there are many mysterious people in this estate,” Ying Jiu sighed deeply.

“So do I,” Qu Gaoyi nodded in agreement.

Meng Wuya was one thing, but the Sealing Yuan Curse from Huang Jiuzhou was smashed just like that—an earth-shattering method.

The newly arrived pair of sisters were also extremely strange. Although they only possessed strength equivalent to the eighth stage of the True Yuan Realm, both Ying Jiu and Qu Gaoyi felt their battle prowess was not inferior to Divine Roaming Realm warriors, and even bested most at the mid-tier Divine Roaming Realm.

Then there was the young master’s Senior Sister. Shrouded behind a veil, she came and went from the pill workshop, from which all kinds of high-grade, Pill Pattern-bearing pills were produced.

Mystery-Grade pills had become commonplace in Yang Kai’s mansion.

Moreover, the woman’s strength progressed astonishingly fast. When she first arrived, she was at the first stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, seemingly having just broken through. In a blink, she reached the second stage and now was firmly stable—soon to advance to the third.

She had never been seen entering seclusion; how could her strength grow so quickly?

Furthermore, after taking those pills, the young masters and missuses in the estate also changed tremendously day by day. The men became more handsome, the women more radiant. Each seemed reborn, their progress far faster than normal, though not as terrifying as the veiled woman’s.

None were more mysterious than the young master himself.

Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu’s injuries had long since healed, leaving no old wounds behind. Even Xiao Shun, who recently joined, said he felt refreshed, his hidden ailments disappearing, and that his cultivation speed was faster than before.

All of this was surely thanks to the earth-grade pills the young master gave them, no one truly understood the secrets contained within.

His own methods were nearly miraculous; since the start of the succession war, he had performed many startling feats, earning Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu’s profound admiration.

It’s said that every generation produces new talent—how could this generation produce so many strange geniuses, all congregated around Yang Kai?

“Old Qu, I might reach the ninth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm soon,” Ying Jiu smiled faintly.

“Hmph, me too,” Qu Gaoyi replied without yielding.

“Have we ever cultivated this fast before?” Ying Jiu looked at him seriously.

“No,” Qu Gaoyi frowned. “What are you getting at?”

“I just think it’s odd that so many prodigies gather around the young master. Are they drawn together, or did the young master create them?” Ying Jiu said meaningfully.

Qu Gaoyi’s expression changed, his face filled with shock.

Ying Jiu’s words suddenly snapped him awake.

It made no sense that all these prodigies would flock to one young master’s estate. When these young masters and missuses first arrived, they did not manifest many special traits; they were only slightly stronger than average. Yet over time, each seemed to become extraordinarily gifted.

These days, breakthroughs came one after another within the estate, ascending to higher stages.

But if it was the young master’s doing, how exactly did he accomplish it? Even the Yang Family’s Transformation Dragon Pool lacked such a conspicuous effect.
