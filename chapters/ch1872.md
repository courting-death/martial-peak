## Chapter 1872 — Give an Inch, Take a Li

Whoosh whoosh whoosh...

A tearing sound rang out; countless illusory images of Gongsun Liang shot back in one direction, revealing their true body as they coldly stared at Yang Kai without a word.

Not far from him, Li Maoming's figure likewise manifested.

The two of them spread out like the horns of a crescent, closing in on Yang Kai from both sides.

Yang Kai wore an amused smile, reached out a hand, and the Golden Blood Threads that had danced across the field returned, drawn back into his body.

Only then did the others involuntarily breathe out; in those short twenty or thirty breaths just now, the number of warriors slain by the two Second Stage of the Void King Realm had already exceeded sixty.

Those sixty were all experts at the Second or Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the very backbone of Purple Star!

Fortunately the crisis had passed; while their hearts still trembled, they could not help but feel a pang of sorrow for the fallen.

As if by tacit agreement, everyone ceased fighting and turned their gazes to the three Second Stage of the Void Kings hovering in the sky; everyone knew the outcome of today's battle rested with these three.

There was no meaning in continuing the fight; since it was pointless, naturally they were unwilling to see more blood.

In an instant the once-rowdy battlefield fell quiet; countless eyes flicked among Yang Kai, Gongsun Liang and Li Maoming, faces grave.

Those on Second Young Master's side looked ashen, as if their parents had died; they were no fools and could clearly see the situation was dire for their side—if Yang Kai lost, they would be the defeated, and the defeated's fate was never pleasant.

"What? Trying to gang up on the few with the many?" Yang Kai asked with a half-smile, showing no sign of panic.

Gongsun Liang snorted coldly and said nothing, as if greatly angered at Yang Kai. Li Maoming pondered for a moment, then spoke politely: "Since your surname is Yang, I shall call you Brother Yang. Brother Yang, now that you have accepted the Venerable One token, you are Purple Star's Venerable One, one of Purple Star's people. You surely do not wish to see the current situation, do you?"

Yang Kai chuckled lightly and replied casually, "Of course."

Li Maoming forced a smile. "Brother Yang thinking this way is all the better; since Brother Yang has Purple Star in his heart, may I say a few words?"

"Brother Li, please speak!" Yang Kai said with a smile.

"Let today's matter end here. If you continue fighting, it is Purple Star as a whole that will suffer damage, which benefits no one. Enemies should be resolved, not made permanent. Why don't the two of you stop and make peace?" Li Maoming asked earnestly.

Not far off, Zi Wuji's heart trembled and his face was anxious; he feared Yang Kai might utter an approving word, for if that happened his defeat would be absolute.

He could not help but secretly pray that Yang Kai would see things through; if so, he would still have a slim chance.

Unexpectedly, after Li Maoming finished speaking Yang Kai nodded without hesitation and said, "Brother Li is right; I do intend this — I was even going to admit defeat, after all, the two of you together, I can't beat you, can I?"

Zi Wuji's face stiffened and he uncontrollably spat a mouthful of blood.

In that moment he understood he truly had no hope; he had never imagined an expert of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm like Yang Kai would be so spineless! Compared to him, Li Maoming seemed far more reliable.

Yang Kai's ready agreement left Li Maoming stunned; the earnest admonitions he had prepared fell flat. He laughed and said, "Brother Yang truly understands righteousness, I admire you. Um, Great Elder, what do you think?"

He then turned his gaze to Gongsun Liang.

Gongsun Liang narrowed his eyes at Yang Kai and said in a deep voice, "To cease and make peace is certainly allowable!"

Li Maoming rejoiced, but before he could say more Gongsun Liang added, "But this Venerable One has killed so many of mine; that cannot be left unaddressed."

Li Maoming's brow creased and displeasure flickered across his face; he could not fathom why Gongsun Liang was so impertinent.

"And what do you intend?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, his gaze colliding with Gongsun Liang's.

"To hold the title of Venerable One yet not care for the lives of Purple Star's disciples—what right have you to sit in that seat and receive Purple Star's veneration? Return the Venerable One token to Purple Star; Purple Star does not need a Venerable One like you!" Gongsun Liang snorted.

At these words Li Maoming's expression changed; he glanced at Gongsun Liang with a complicated look, seeming to want to say something but ultimately sighing and falling silent.

With his scheming mind he naturally perceived Gongsun Liang's true intention.

Even if, under his mediation, the two made peace today, grudges would remain, and with Yang Kai standing with Zi Wuji, if Gongsun Liang wished to fully control Purple Star, Yang Kai would have to be removed as an adverse factor.

Otherwise Gongsun Liang could never rest easy.

It was for this reason that Gongsun Liang proposed as he did.

But the proposal was clearly insulting; whether this Venerable One could accept it was uncertain, and if it provoked him to rage and strike again, matters would become difficult.

Li Maoming fretted anxiously, watching Yang Kai's expression carefully, prepared to step in and broker a discussion should anything go awry.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai showed no sign of anger; instead he smiled and said, "So that's all it was. Fine — I never wanted to be this Venerable One anyway. Great Elder, since you want the Venerable One token, take it!"

With that he casually tossed a token, which flew straight toward Gongsun Liang.

Gongsun Liang's eyes were quick and his hand faster; he snatched it up and upon inspection found it indeed to be the Venerable One token, and he stood there stunned.

He had not expected the other to truly be so indifferent to the token; he had only spoken to lead into another demand, not to truly strip Yang Kai of his title, so the token being handed over left him incredulous.

Yang Kai's cooperation had instantly thrown his plan into disorder.

Gongsun Liang did not know what to say.

"Heh heh... Brother Yang is indeed a carefree man, I admire you!" Li Maoming looked at Yang Kai as if at a monster, then turned to Gongsun Liang and said, "Great Elder, Brother Yang has returned the Venerable One token; so today's matter..."

"It's not over!" Gongsun Liang waved his hand, cutting Li Maoming off, and glared at Yang Kai: "Though the Venerable One token has been returned, your killing of so many cannot be left unpunished."

"You're not finished?" Yang Kai sneered. He truly had no use for Purple Star's Venerable One token — he had come here only for the Star Emperor Token, which he had already obtained; he would never return, so the Venerable One token was worthless to him, and he tossed it aside.

He had not expected Gongsun Liang to keep pressing and refuse to relent, which angered Yang Kai greatly.

"Killing must be paid for with death, that's only right! But your power is profound and I cannot guarantee taking your life. How about this: you compensate with valuables so I can answer to my people!" Gongsun Liang said.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but grin, looking at Gongsun Liang with amused interest. “Compensation? Mm? And what exactly is it you want me to compensate with?”

Gongsun Liang's face turned solemn as he stared at Yang Kai, his lips moving slightly.

Li Maoming leaned in with a sullen face, trying to eavesdrop but unable to hear, feeling helpless.

To him it would be best if today's matter ended here; he would have repaid Gongsun Liang's face and avoided fighting Yang Kai. Heaven knew what had come over Gongsun Liang to make him so greedy.

He believed that whatever valuables Gongsun Liang demanded would be exceedingly precious; if they could not reach an agreement, trouble would surely follow.

Irritated yet on guard, he watched carefully.

Sure enough, after Gongsun Liang whispered secretly, Yang Kai said, "So you want that thing — I understand."

The item Gongsun Liang wanted was none other than the Void Mind Crystal Yang Kai had obtained at an auction half a month ago! That old man had surely sensed the auctioned item's extraordinariness and had been thinking it over these days, and so now demanded it.

"Hand the item over and I will let you go!" Gongsun Liang said in a low voice.

"What if I don't give it?" Yang Kai asked, casting a sidelong glance.

Gongsun Liang said unhurriedly, “Before you speak further, you’d best think it through. Your strength is impressive, yes—but if I join forces with Brother Li, it’s not certain we couldn’t subdue you. Do you truly mean to set yourself against this old man to the bitter end?”

Yang Kai burst into loud laughter. “What a joke! You’re the one overstepping. You want something of mine? Fine—come take it yourself. Let’s see if you have the ability!”

Seeing the talks collapse, Li Maoming felt a headache coming and stood to one side, frowning.

"Very well, words are useless. Brother Li, join me in striking!" Gongsun Liang roared; his Saint Yuan erupted as he pointed ahead and a short-sword-shaped Secret Treasure appeared. He grasped the hilt and charged in with the blade.

He was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, stalled in that realm for years and immensely powerful. As he summoned the Secret Treasure, a Domain Field coalesced around him, wildly pressing down toward Yang Kai.

In an instant the space where Yang Kai stood became viscid; even the flow of Spiritual Qi seemed to halt.

He shifted his feet, and in an instant appeared above Yang Kai’s head, bringing his sword cleaving down.

The short sword erupted with blinding radiance and terrifying energy fluctuations, as if slicing the heavens—its momentum astonishing.

Yang Kai stood where he was and watched coldly; as the attack neared he suddenly produced a Dragon Bone sword in his palm—no edge, no blade—and placed it horizontally to block above him.

Boom...

A deafening explosion sounded; from the point where the two sword-type Secret Treasures met, world-shattering force spread outward, casting a huge visible halo.

Gongsun Liang’s expression changed at once; his eyes nearly bulged from their sockets as he stared at Yang Kai now standing mere inches away, his face filled with utter disbelief.
