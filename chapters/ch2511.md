## Chapter 2511 — Having Quite a Bit of Fun

Yang Kai snorted, "Whenever I’m in a bad mood, I tend to spout nonsense. Who knows, maybe I’ll turn today’s events into a twelve-chapter, thirty-six-section tale and spread it to every storyteller in the Eastern Territory’s taverns and teahouses. Let them sing Senior Li’s praises far and wide! I’ve even thought of the perfect title: ‘The Daily Life of Jiu Feng of the Spirit Beast Island and Her Loyal Servant.’ What do you think, Senior Li?"

Li Wuyi flared up, "Didn't you just say you saw nothing at all? How can a junior's words be so unreliable!"

Yang Kai replied leisurely, "Well, I suddenly remembered a few things after all."

"You're actually this shameless!" Li Wuyi exclaimed in shock.

Yang Kai stretched lazily and said, "People only show their true colors when they're pushed to the edge."

Jiu Feng giggled on the side, her laughter making her body tremble like a flower swaying in the wind, clearly extremely delighted.

"Fine, fine, fine!" Li Wuyi stammered, gritting his teeth as he glared at Yang Kai. "You forced my hand, so I guess this Lord will have to teach you a lesson. Kid, take this!"

As he finished speaking, he raised his hand, and a streak of light shot toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, but didn't dodge. Instead, he reached out to grab the streak of light. As it landed in his hand, his body paused slightly, his eyes flickered, and he quietly put the object away without a word.

"Now you know this Lord's strength, don't you? See if you dare spout nonsense again and tarnish this Lord's reputation." Li Wuyi snorted coldly.

Yang Kai grinned and cupped his fists, "Senior Li's cultivation is profound. This junior admits his inferiority. If I offended you earlier, I hope Senior Li won't take it to heart."

Li Wuyi said boldly, "This Lord is magnanimous. How could I stoop to your level?"

Jiu Feng glanced at the two coldly and said with a pout, "You two are having quite a bit of fun."

Li Wuyi burst out laughing, "Just gave a little lesson to a youngster who doesn’t know his place—can’t let the youth get too cocky. If you have any advice, Lady Jiu Feng, I’m all ears."

Jiu Feng snorted coldly. Her beautiful eyes lingered on Yang Kai for a while before a hint of admiration appeared. She said, "Last time we met, you were only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. I didn't expect that in just a few short years, you've already advanced to the Emperor Realm. I really misjudged you."

No matter who it is, to advance from the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm to the First Stage of the Emperor Realm in such a short time, and to have such a solid foundation and pure, dense strength, is truly worthy of being called a genius.

"Senior flatters me. This junior only made it this far by chance." Yang Kai replied modestly.

Jiu Feng said, "But the First Stage of the Emperor Realm is only the beginning of the Martial Dao's peak. If you want to glimpse the true summit, you must work even harder. Don't become arrogant and impatient."

Yang Kai's expression turned solemn, and he said in a deep voice, "I will remember your teachings, Senior."

Although Jiu Feng's words seemed mild, with her strength, if she didn't truly think highly of Yang Kai, she wouldn't bother saying anything at all. For her to offer such encouragement and warning was already giving him great face.

Jiu Feng nodded lightly, clearly satisfied with his attitude. Only then did her phoenix eyes narrow, exuding a dangerous aura. Her sharp gaze seemed to pierce through Yang Kai, stabbing straight at Mo Xiaoqi, who was hiding behind him. She said coldly, "Aren't you coming out yet?"

Hearing this, Mo Xiaoqi pouted and reluctantly walked out from behind Yang Kai, her eyes darting around as if searching for an escape route.

Jiu Feng, both exasperated and amused, said, "Do you really think hiding like that will keep Uncle Li and Aunt Feng from noticing you? Are you pretending to be blind, or do you think we are?"

Mo Xiaoqi retorted angrily, "With your strength, does it matter where I hide?"

Jiu Feng arched her brows and snapped, "Still talking back? Looks like you’re itching for trouble! If I don’t discipline you every few days, you’ll turn the house upside down."

Mo Xiaoqi pouted pitifully at Li Wuyi, her voice tinged with a sob, "Uncle Li, Aunt Feng wants to hit me. You have to stand up for me!"

"She wouldn't dare!" Li Wuyi's expression turned fierce, his aura surging. The timid look from before vanished, replaced by a dazzling brilliance like the sun.

Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart, suddenly realizing the vast gap between himself and these veteran Emperor Realm experts.

"Hmm?" Jiu Feng snorted from her nose, glancing sideways at Li Wuyi.

Li Wuyi snorted, "Don't be afraid, Xiaoqi. If she really dares to hit you, I'll, I'll..."

"You'll what?" Jiu Feng looked at him coldly.

Li Wuyi immediately grinned cheekily, "I'll just grab Xiaoqi and let you hit her as much as you want!"

Crunch, crunch...

Mo Xiaoqi stood beside Yang Kai, grinding her teeth so hard she nearly cracked them.

At that moment, Li Wuyi's expression suddenly turned serious as he looked at Mo Xiaoqi. Then his face changed dramatically and he cried out, "Xiaoqi, you undid the seal?"

"What?" Jiu Feng was also startled. In a flash, she appeared beside Mo Xiaoqi, grabbed her, and examined her carefully.

After a while, Jiu Feng discovered clear traces that Mo Xiaoqi had indeed undone the Sacred Soul Seal. Her face paled as she asked, "How did you undo the seal? Did you encounter a life-threatening danger? Who was the bastard that dared to harm you?"

Her peak Emperor Realm aura erupted, and a violent, murderous intent radiated from her body, as if she could kill at any moment.

Caught off guard, Yang Kai was sent flying several zhang away, his chest churning with Qi and blood, nearly unable to catch his breath.

Zhang Ruoxi cried out in alarm, retreating even farther than Yang Kai.

"Who was it? Tell Aunt Feng, and I'll wipe out his entire family right now!" Jiu Feng's killing intent was so intense it seemed to make the very air sizzle.

Li Wuyi also descended from the sky, his face so cold it seemed to freeze the very air. He didn’t say a word, but the murderous intent radiating from him was even more palpable than Jiu Feng’s.

Mo Xiaoqi's Sacred Soul Seal was her final trump card. Unless she faced mortal danger, she would never undo it. Now that there were signs it had been undone, it meant she had truly faced a life-or-death crisis in the Shattered Star Sea.

These two top experts had watched Mo Xiaoqi grow up. How could they tolerate anyone harming her? So, upon sensing the seal had been undone, both were filled with murderous intent, oblivious to everything else.

Seeing their terrifying expressions, Mo Xiaoqi naturally didn't dare tell the truth. She could only stick out her tongue and say, "No one tried to harm me. I just accidentally undid it myself."

"Impossible!" Jiu Feng snorted coldly. "The Illusory Heaven Butterfly's Spirit Essence was sealed by the Lord himself with the Burning Moon Rainbow Seal. The only way to undo it is if your life is in danger."

Li Wuyi added, "Be good, Xiaoqi. Tell Uncle Li and Aunt Feng what really happened."

"Really, it's nothing. I just undid it by accident." Mo Xiaoqi waved her hands repeatedly.

Jiu Feng snorted, knowing there must be a reason for Mo Xiaoqi's insistence. Unable to get anything from her, she turned to Yang Kai and said coldly, "Since you appeared here with Xiaoqi, you must have traveled together in the Shattered Star Sea. Tell me, what really happened?"

Yang Kai sighed and said, "Seniors, to be honest, the reason Xiaoqi undid the seal was ultimately because of me."

"Because of you?" Li Wuyi frowned suspiciously. "Did you try to kill Xiaoqi?"

But that didn't make sense. Though Xiaoqi was naive, she wasn't stupid. If Yang Kai had really tried to kill her, she would've run as far away as possible.

Jiu Feng said coldly, "Explain yourself!"

Yang Kai nodded, organized his thoughts, and explained how Mo Xiaoqi, thinking he was in mortal danger, had an emotional outburst and undid the Sacred Soul Seal.

After hearing this, Jiu Feng and Li Wuyi looked at each other in surprise.

They had never known that Mo Xiaoqi could undo the Sacred Soul Seal because someone else was in danger. But thinking back, the Lord had only said that if Xiaoqi sensed a life-threatening crisis, the seal would be triggered—she never said it had to be Xiaoqi's own life.

In that case, it seemed Xiaoqi valued this boy greatly, almost putting him on the same level as herself. So when he was in danger, the seal was triggered.

As their eyes met, Jiu Feng and Li Wuyi both understood what the other was thinking, and a strange feeling welled up inside them.

They turned and glared fiercely at Yang Kai at the same time.

Yang Kai felt a chill run down his spine, but didn't dare make a sound.

"How was the Sacred Soul re-sealed? This method isn't the Lord's, but another extremely advanced technique. Was it... you who sealed it?" Jiu Feng asked in disbelief.

Yang Kai gave an awkward laugh, "I don't have that ability. Someone else re-sealed the Sacred Soul."

"Oh?" Li Wuyi grew interested. "Among the younger generation, someone can seal the Sacred Soul? Tell us, which family's kid is so capable?"

"That person isn't some junior. That person is..." Yang Kai's mouth twitched. After hesitating for a moment, he finally mouthed three words softly.

Li Wuyi and Jiu Feng were both shocked, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Yang Kai said quietly, "No need to doubt. It's exactly the person you two are thinking of."

"Impossible!" Jiu Feng shrieked. "Emperors can't enter the Shattered Star Sea. No matter how strong that Lord is, it's impossible to break that restriction."

Li Wuyi's expression was also grave. "That's right. Besides, that Lord is as elusive as a dragon. Why would they go to a place like the Shattered Star Sea? The Origin Power there is nice, but that Lord probably wouldn't care about it."

Yang Kai said, "If anyone else asked, I wouldn't say a word, since this is a serious matter. But since you two are from the Spirit Beast Island, I won't hide it. I hope that after you return to Spirit Beast Island, you can report what happened in the Shattered Star Sea to the Beast Great Emperor and see if he can think of a solution."

"A solution? What kind of solution?" Jiu Feng looked at Yang Kai suspiciously, clearly confused.

"What exactly are you trying to say?" Li Wuyi also looked at him strangely.
