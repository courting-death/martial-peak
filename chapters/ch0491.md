## Chapter 491 — Already Too Late

The father and son bickered like a well-rehearsed duo, their quarrel unending. Qiu Yimeng’s delicate brows furrowed slightly, her tone laced with indifference as she said, “Uncle, if you only want to discipline your son, you could do so back at the Lü Family. It’s not necessary to do it here.”

Sensing the impatience and coldness in Qiu Yimeng’s voice, Lü Liang was startled at heart. Disregarding his concern for his son, he strode over to Lü Song, abruptly lifting him up and then pressing him down to the ground.

With a swift movement, he restrained him.

Lü Song’s face flushed red, kneeling on the floor, feeling utterly humiliated. Even his gaze toward Lü Liang turned hostile.

“If you dare defy me again, I will cripple you right now!” Lü Liang’s expression darkened, his tone calm but resolute.

He was not joking.

Realizing this, Lü Song did not dare utter another word.

“You’ve embarrassed the young lady,” Lü Liang said with a slight bow and cupped fist.

Qiu Yimeng suddenly found the situation tasteless. She naturally understood Lü Liang’s intentions, but having such an unruly son was a headache no one wanted to deal with.

This Lü Song was even worse in character than Huo Xingchen, who was regarded as a spoiled prodigal. Though Huo Xingchen was arrogant and unruly, at least he was clever enough to stay close to Yang Kai.

“If Uncle has something to say, please speak plainly,” Qiu Yimeng no longer wished to look at Lü Song’s scoundrel expression and was too tired to even offer polite words.

Lü Liang sighed, “This time, I originally intended to visit your father in Zhongdu, but on the way, I unexpectedly received some shocking news.”

“That bastard son was driven out of the manor by the Ninth Young Master, yet he didn’t send word to inform me of the truth at the Lü Family. Instead, he deliberately concealed it. I had always assumed he was working under the Ninth Young Master, but only now did I learn he had thrown himself under the Fifth Young Master’s banner.”

“Uncle...” Qiu Yimeng called out, signaling Lü Liang to stop discussing trivial matters. Regardless of knowing the truth, the most important thing now was what Lü Liang planned to do.

Lü Liang’s expression turned awkward. He stopped pursuing the matter and instead smiled politely: “Young lady, I only wish to ask... how is the Ninth Young Master’s current attitude?”

“His attitude?” Qiu Yimeng pondered briefly, then gave a wry smile. “If you ask me, Uncle, you are overreacting.”

“Huh?” Lü Liang looked puzzled.

“Yang Kai never took Lü Song seriously in the first place. For him to be beaten up like this was the doing of the Dong Family. Knowing Yang Kai’s character, if Lü Song had truly angered him, do you think he would still be alive last night?”

“Would he dare kill me?” Lü Song twisted the corner of his mouth, demanding fiercely.

“You can try and see if he dares!” Qiu Yimeng’s pretty face suddenly went icy cold.

Chilled at heart, Lü Song immediately suppressed his arrogance.

“Uncle,” Qiu Yimeng turned to Lü Liang, her tone softening, “Lü Song came to seek refuge. Being chased out by Yang Kai, I also bear some responsibility because I thought he was not fit to stay in Yang Kai’s manor. You know your son’s nature well enough. If he stays there, one day he is bound to meet an untimely death. So I encouraged him to do certain things so Yang Kai could find an excuse to expel him.”

Lü Liang smiled bitterly and nodded: “Young lady, your intentions are sincere; I am truly grateful.”

“The next day, I also talked to him, telling him to leave War City. He refused and stayed on. Seeking shelter with Yang Kang was also his freedom of choice. Yang Kai doesn’t even know this, and even if he did, he probably wouldn’t care. There’s no reason to blame you — if he doesn’t want your support, is he not allowed to turn to others?”

Qiu Yimeng spoke earnestly and sincerely.

“This mess was his own doing; no one else is to blame,” she said, gazing at Lü Liang: “If anyone is at fault, it’s you, for allowing him to participate in the succession war.”

“I have failed to educate my son properly!” Lü Liang looked ashamed. He was well aware of his son's character, but the succession war was such a major event that he hoped having Lü Song participate would temper and cultivate his disposition, preparing him to inherit the Lü Family’s legacy.

Before coming, he had repeatedly warned Lü Song, but all his words were ignored.

“Yang Kai will not blame you; rest assured. Even if he truly becomes the head of the Yang Family, your Lü Family will not be implicated in this matter.”

Hearing this, Lü Liang finally breathed a sigh of relief.

What he feared most was exactly this. Judging by appearances, Yang Kai would inevitably become the next head of the Yang Family. If one day he chose to settle the grudges born from the succession war, the Lü Family might suffer unwarranted disaster.

“Thank you for your guidance, young lady!” Lü Liang repeatedly expressed his gratitude, visibly relaxing. After a pause, feeling somewhat embarrassed, he asked, “Young lady, one more question—is the Ninth Young Master still in need of men?”

Qiu Yimeng looked at him with a light laugh: “Uncle, what exactly do you want to do?”

Lü Liang rubbed his hands nervously and smiled: “I only want that bastard son to redeem himself by service! Don’t worry, once the Ninth Young Master says the word, my Lü Family will offer men and strength without asking for anything in return.”

“That chance probably won’t come,” Qiu Yimeng shook her head slowly.

“You’re worried about Lü Song? After this loss, I think he should have gained some sense. If only...” 

“Uncle, when Yang Kai and I stayed at your Lü Family, I told you that if I were you, I would choose Yang Kai as an ally!”

“Yes,” Lü Liang said bitterly. He did recall that Qiu Yimeng had said so but did not heed her advice, firmly believing his own judgment. At first, he cared somewhat about Yang Kai, but later his attitude turned distinctly disdainful.

“But what about you...” Qiu Yimeng sneered, “Spending three million taels, Uncle, you’re quite generous.”

Lü Liang’s face flushed red, wishing he could crawl into the earth and disappear.

Three million taels was indeed a substantial sum, but for the Lü Family and to support the disciples from the Yang Family in the succession war, it was merely a drop in the bucket. When Yang Kai left the Lü Family, Lü Liang only gave him three million taels, partly because of his association with Yao Wang Valley’s Xiao Fusheng.

Who would have known Yang Kai’s popularity would soar so high?

Had he known earlier, Lü Liang would have bound the Lü Family and Yang Kai inseparably—giving people, money, and resources without hesitation, never belittling him.

Now, Lü Liang’s regret was bitter beyond words.

“It’s too late, uncle. Helping someone in dire straits is not the same as assisting them when they already have success,” Qiu Yimeng said, rising. “I’m busy with affairs at the manor and won’t see you off. Do as you please.”

She turned and left without looking back.

Lü Liang stood there, stunned, his expression shifting as a storm of emotions swirled within him. Unspoken frustration and discomfort weighed heavily.

The Lü Family was his creation. Once only a second-tier force, it had risen to a first-rate force under the auspices of the Qiu Family.

All these years, Lü Liang strove to raise the family’s stature. The succession war was the perfect opportunity. Standing on the right side, the Lü Family could rise step by step.

But this promising chance slipped right through his fingers.

There was even room to salvage the situation when Lü Song came with people and resources to join. If, instead of Lü Song, another young disciple from the family had come to manage this matter, perhaps they could now be laughing alongside the martial artists at Yang Kai’s manor, watching the turning tides of fortune.

“Bastard!” Lü Liang swung his hand and delivered a heavy slap to Lü Song, sending him flying. His eyes were filled with bitter disappointment.

“Dad, you hit me?” Lü Song held his swollen cheek, staring at Lü Liang in disbelief.

Lü Liang took a deep breath and said firmly: “Step down from inheriting the family leadership. Yuan Di is more suitable than you.”

This incident finally opened Lü Liang’s eyes. If the family were entrusted to Lü Song, it would surely fall into decline within a few years.

“Yuan Di is the son of the Second Uncle...” Lü Song was stunned.

“My mind is made up. Go home,” Lü Liang said without even looking at his son, folding his hands behind his back as he strode away. Lü Song was left disheartened and lost.

He never expected that merely because of the succession war, he would be stripped of his position as heir.

...

In Senior Sister’s room, Yang Kai had already treated it as his own. Whenever free, he would stay here for a few days.

Having received a batch of newly forged pills from Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai immediately threw himself into cultivation.

Tu Feng and Yan Lingxing’s Sealing Yuan Curse would take at least several days to lift. Although Ying Jiu, Qu Gaoyi, and Tang Yuxian had all taken the medicinal pills with Wan Yao Ling Ye, their recovery would also require days.

Yang Kai was only one step away from Divine Roaming Realm, so there was no question of him slacking off.

He cultivated while simultaneously refining treasures.

The immense utility of the Bone Shield made Yang Kai clearly recognize the strength of a Mystery-Grade treasure. Naturally, the Mystery-Grade middle-level mirror was also added to his list of urgently needed items to refine.

With Senior Sister’s elixir nourishing him, the true essence consumed during refining could be quickly replenished.

Moreover, his Divine Sense continuously probed the secrets of the True Alchemy Formula.

Yang Kai’s cultivation was practically twofold, but his efficiency and progress were not hindered.

Sensing pure thoughts and grasping the intricate and mysterious alchemical path in the True Alchemy Formula, Yang Kai’s expression shifted brilliantly as he deeply absorbed its teachings.

The alchemical path within the True Alchemy Formula differed greatly from the common alchemist’s experience and methods. The mysteries it contained were hard to measure by ordinary logic.

Connecting all knowledge previously gained from the formula, Yang Kai developed a deeper understanding of alchemy at a new stage.

Unconsciously, Yang Kai’s precious experience had already drawn a considerable gap between his level and the rest of the world. The only shortcoming was his own practical hands-on experience.

But he knew the opportunity would come. He was still young, with a long future ahead. He could try many different endeavors. Even trying to glimpse the secrets of martial arts through alchemy was not impossible.
