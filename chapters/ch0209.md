## Chapter 209 — Battle of True Essence

The entire arena was in shock as Dong Qinghan stared blankly at Yang Kai. He never expected that after four years of absence, his cousin would become so ruthless. A martial artist at the Separation and Union Realm, Fifth Stage, had fallen to the ground in less than thirty breaths of time, while Yang Kai remained completely unscathed.

Amidst the swirling dust, Yang Kai stood tall, his expression cold and indifferent, surveying the entire scene with an air of superiority.

Bai Yunfeng and Fan Hong displayed slight shock on their faces. After a moment, Bai Yunfeng glanced at the fallen Cao Zhengwen and snorted coldly, “As expected of disciples raised by small sects, they are truly weak and unable to withstand a single blow. It seems I must take matters into my own hands!”

Fan Hong looked at him in surprise, then quickly understood. As the young master of the Bai family, Bai Yunfeng held himself in high regard. Although he did not care about Cao Zhengwen's life or death, he was still a disciple he had recruited, making him half a member of the Bai family. Now, in front of him, that disciple had been beaten to a pulp; how could Bai Yunfeng let this slide?

If it were him, Fan Hong would not let it go either. Moreover, that Yang Kai possessed a set of Mystery-Grade martial skills. It was a perfect excuse to teach him a lesson and then force him to reveal the cultivation method of that martial skill.

Thinking of this, Fan Hong couldn't help but feel a bit regretful. He shot a cold glance at the Lingxiao Pavilion disciple standing behind him, wondering why Yang Kai hadn’t targeted him earlier. If he had been beaten down, he would have had a reason to act.

“Bai brother, isn’t it inappropriate to act on someone else's territory?” Dong Qinghan stepped forward, worried that Yang Kai might not be able to handle it. After all, Bai Yunfeng was already a True Essence Realm expert, and there was a significant gap between the True Essence Realm and the Separation and Union Realm.

Bai Yunfeng replied coldly, “What does it matter whose territory it is? Anyone who dares to harm a disciple of the Bai family must pay the price!”

He was determined to make Yang Kai suffer.

Dong Qinghan furrowed his brows, wanting to help but unsure how to intervene. After all, to outsiders, he and Yang Kai were merely acquaintances. If he acted too obviously, it would likely expose him. Once Yang Kai's identity was revealed, it would only bring him trouble, not benefits.

The Yang family was powerful, but they had many enemies. Countless people in the world harbored hatred towards the Yang family.

Just as he was in a dilemma, he noticed Yang Kai secretly giving him a glance. Dong Qinghan's heart stirred, and he stopped speaking.

Bai Yunfeng slowly walked towards Yang Kai, instructing, “Elders, please stand by and observe.”

“Yes!” Two elderly figures responded in deep voices.

Dong Qinghan had a Divine Roaming Realm expert guarding him, and Bai Yunfeng and Fan Hong certainly had their own protectors. After all, they were the elite of their respective factions. Until they had fully developed their strength, someone had to ensure their safety.

“I'll give you one last chance. Submit to the Bai family and hand over that martial skill. I will spare your life!” Bai Yunfeng raised his head arrogantly, looking down at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sneered, his primordial energy surging, battle intent soaring.

No further words were needed; his attitude spoke volumes.

“Very well, I will spare your life, as you still hold some value!” After Bai Yunfeng finished speaking, his figure blurred, resembling dust blown by the wind, ethereal and elusive.

Yang Kai's expression turned grim, not daring to let his guard down. Although Bai Yunfeng appeared arrogant and reckless, he was the young master of the Bai family and had a significant advantage in strength. Underestimating him could lead to a fatal mistake, and Yang Kai could easily be knocked down by a single blow.

Yang Kai did not wish to confront such an enemy right now.

However, thinking about how Bai Yunfeng lingered around Su Yan's pavilion all day, Yang Kai felt a wave of annoyance. Every man regarded his woman as a treasure; although Bai Yunfeng had never seen Su Yan, his mere presence irritated Yang Kai.

Strange dust appeared behind Yang Kai as Bai Yunfeng emerged with a cold smile, lightly slapping towards Yang Kai's back, containing unmatched power, hidden yet potent.

Dong Qinghan's expression changed dramatically, nearly speaking out to warn him.

Yang Kai suddenly turned, his palm glowing red. The scorching True Yang Primordial Qi erupted from his palm, clashing with Bai Yunfeng's attack.

The wind howled, and the energies of heaven and earth became chaotic. Yang Kai's figure shook violently, flying back several dozen zhang, while Bai Yunfeng remained completely still, his expression calm and unbothered.

Previously, although they had exchanged blows, Yang Kai had used eighty percent of his strength, while Bai Yunfeng had been caught off guard, allowing them to match each other.

But now Bai Yunfeng was furious, and his attack was not comparable to before.

With just one strike, Yang Kai suffered a setback, landing on the ground before quickly standing up, his expression grave as he looked at Bai Yunfeng.

“A Separation and Union Realm First Stage dares to fight against me? You really overestimate yourself!” Bai Yunfeng sneered, his figure shifting again. It was unclear what bizarre movement technique he was using, making it impossible to discern his true position.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth, his eyes glinting coldly, remaining highly alert to his surroundings.

“Can you defend against this?” Bai Yunfeng's voice suddenly appeared in the void, and then his figure appeared just three feet in front of Yang Kai, still casually striking out.

Triple Flame Yang Explosion!

Yang Kai no longer held back, directly unleashing the martial skill he had comprehended.

Bai Yunfeng's expression flickered with caution; he had sensed the ferocity of this attack. However, as a young master of the Bai family and a True Essence Realm expert, he would not retreat. Instead, he rushed forward even faster.

He wanted to defeat Yang Kai with overwhelming power and strength, making him aware of the vast gap between them.

With a loud crash, Yang Kai was pushed back again, his primordial energy showing signs of disorder. Bai Yunfeng remained composed, ready to mock him, but his expression suddenly changed. He let out a muffled grunt as he forced out a wave of scorching True Yang Primordial Qi that Yang Kai had pushed into his body.

“Three Transformations!” Bai Yunfeng's eyes lit up, completely taken aback that Yang Kai had mastered such an extraordinary martial skill. This skill was immensely powerful and unpredictable, definitely at the Heaven-Grade level. Just now, he had almost suffered a significant loss if he had not reacted quickly to expel it.

“Good stuff! After I defeat you, I will take it all!” Bai Yunfeng grinned sinisterly, his body once again turning into a cloud of dust.

Yang Kai's body tensed, focusing even more on sensing the changes around him. Suddenly, his eyes erupted with brilliance as he reached out towards the void, his primordial energy raging like a blazing inferno.

His palm pressed against the void, erupting violently. Bai Yunfeng appeared in a hurry, his face filled with surprise and panic as he retreated just in time to narrowly avoid Yang Kai's strike.

The Divine Roaming Realm experts observing from the side were all astonished. Although they could sense Bai Yunfeng's movements due to their cultivated Divine Sense, this Lingxiao Pavilion disciple relied on what? He was only at the Separation and Union Realm First Stage, lacking Divine Sense, yet he could perceive Bai Yunfeng's secrets after just a few exchanges?

Was his battle intuition too powerful?

“I was wondering what it was. Turns out it was just relying on the power of a secret treasure!” Yang Kai looked at Bai Yunfeng with disdain, sneering. The mysterious movement technique Bai Yunfeng had used several times was even faster and more elusive than his own creation. Yang Kai had not understood it until he suddenly noticed the jade pendant at Bai Yunfeng's waist glowing, and he instantly realized.

It was not a movement technique at all; it was the secret treasure at work, confusing his vision.

Bai Yunfeng's face flushed. As a True Essence Realm expert dealing with a Separation and Union Realm opponent, using a secret treasure was indeed somewhat inappropriate. Now that Yang Kai had exposed him, he was even more furious, snorting, “Even without the secret treasure, do you think you can match me?”

With a shift of his feet, he shot directly in front of Yang Kai, his speed astonishingly fast.

Unyielding Will!

Against an enemy who was a whole realm above him, Yang Kai did not hold back, directly unleashing this mysterious martial skill of his.

His primordial energy surged violently, filled with ferocity and unparalleled malevolence, his face contorted in a fierce expression. His eyes gleamed with a bloodthirsty and ruthless light.

A surge of power erupted from his body, and a black flame suddenly ignited around him.

In that moment, Yang Kai resembled a demon descending upon the world. His entire being blazed, the air around him distorting. He raised a hand, summoning endless flames, and fiercely swept towards Bai Yunfeng.

The enemy had suddenly transformed. Bai Yunfeng was taken aback, sensing Yang Kai's sudden surge in strength and the scorching primordial energy. In an instant, he realized the terror of this strike. Startled, he dared not hesitate and hurriedly circulated his primordial energy to unleash his killing move.

“Heavenly Net!”

From his ten fingers, True Essence condensed like threads, weaving into a large net in front of him with a flick of his fingers. This net, made purely of True Essence, was sharp enough to cut through gold and jade, rivaling that of an Earth-Grade weapon.

The flames collided with the Heavenly Net, Bai Yunfeng's True Essence threads piercing through the flames without damage, directly enveloping Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's mind stirred, and an even more surging energy erupted from within him, raising the temperature of the flames even further.

To the naked eye, those threads were completely dissolved in the blink of an eye. Then, Yang Kai's palm struck Bai Yunfeng's shoulder.

Both Yang Kai and Bai Yunfeng retreated simultaneously, eyeing each other warily.

Yang Kai's body slowly bore small bloodstains, remnants of the Heavenly Net's attack, each True Essence thread having cut into his skin by half an inch, nearly dismembering him.

In contrast, Bai Yunfeng appeared somewhat disheveled, his shoulder burning as if branded by a hot iron, even emitting a burnt smell. He desperately urged his True Essence, barely managing to dissipate the residual force of Yang Kai's attack.

“Hiss!” A group of Divine Roaming Realm experts gasped, staring at Yang Kai in shock.

Facing a True Essence Realm opponent with only a Separation and Union Realm cultivation, although he was at a disadvantage, he fought with great vigor. Who was this young man? Moreover, his sudden increase in strength was quite strange. Originally at the Separation and Union Realm First Stage, he had suddenly leaped to the peak of the Separation and Union Realm. Along with this strength increase, his demeanor and aura had changed dramatically.

If he had been an ordinary youth before, he now clearly showed signs of going berserk. The most crucial point was that his primordial energy had actually melted Bai Yunfeng's True Essence threads. Did this not mean that the purity and density of his primordial energy were not inferior to that of a True Essence Realm First Stage expert? How else could he achieve such a feat?
