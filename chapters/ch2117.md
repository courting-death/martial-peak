## Chapter 2117 — Jade Maiden Beggar Token

Generally speaking, tokens are always engraved with some kind of pattern or inscription to indicate their origin and purpose.

The token Qin Chaoyang handed to Yang Kai was no exception.

There were no words on the token, but its front bore a vivid, lifelike painting of a jade maiden rising from the water.

Though the lines were somewhat stiff, the Jade Maiden painted on the token seemed to possess a life of her own, slowly emerging from a clear pool. Her graceful figure stirred the imagination, her delicate features were captivating, and the upper part of her body was half-concealed by splashing water and flowing hair.

Most crucially, her lower half was bare. The area between her legs and her belly was submerged beneath the water’s surface, impossible to see yet unbearably tantalizing—making one itch to reach in and pull her out of the token for a closer look!

“Damn it!” Yang Kai cursed after staring for a while, his mood thoroughly ruined.

Whoever painted it was surely twisted, yet understood a man’s heart all too well—deliberately provoking and making one grit their teeth in frustration.

Yang Kai flipped the token over. The back also bore a painting.

The image showed a person with messy hair, dressed in rags, curled up on the ground, with a broken bowl placed before them—empty.

It was the image of a beggar.

The Jade Maiden rising from the water on the front and the beggar on the back gave two completely opposite impressions.

Staring at the image, Yang Kai could almost feel the cold wind sweeping in, and saw the beggar shivering.

"This beggar..." Yang Kai muttered with a frown, "looks like someone I know!"

As he spoke, a sleazy figure popped into his mind unbidden.

"This was given to me by that expert," Qin Chaoyang explained weakly.

“Brother Qin... are you sure that person is an expert, and not... a swindler?” Yang Kai looked at him in astonishment. “This token’s material seems to be just ordinary wood. The painting might be the work of a master, but... what kind of expert would be so frivolous?”

“This is no ordinary wood,” Qin Chaoyang replied solemnly. “I’ve examined it closely—it’s a hundred-year-old elm!”

“Is there a difference?” Yang Kai asked.

Qin Chaoyang’s mouth twitched. “It seems there isn’t much difference.”

Any token is a symbol of authority, a substitute for identity, a manifestation of power. So the material used to forge a token is never just any hundred-year-old elm. For example, the Dragon Isle token in Yang Kai’s hand—he couldn’t even recognize what it was made of.

Yet the material of this ‘Jade Maiden Beggar Token’ was just something ordinary.

This made Yang Kai deeply suspicious, wondering if Qin Chaoyang had been deceived.

“Brother Yang, I know what you’re thinking,” Qin Chaoyang said seriously. “But... try to crush the token!”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. “Brother Qin, you really want me to do that? What if I break it...”

“Then it means I was truly fooled. If it breaks, it’s no loss!”

Yang Kai nodded. “Alright, I’ll give it a try!”

With that, he gripped the token tightly and exerted brute force.

A series of cracking sounds rang out.

Yang Kai’s expression changed abruptly, while Qin Chaoyang smiled as if he’d expected this.

The sound wasn’t the token breaking, but the joints in Yang Kai’s fingers. He’d squeezed the token with all his strength, yet it remained perfectly intact!

“How can this be?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened in disbelief.

The token’s material was clearly ordinary wood, not some special heaven-and-earth treasure. Yet under his brute force, it was completely unharmed?

Unconvinced, Yang Kai increased his strength, but no matter how hard he tried, the token didn’t suffer the slightest damage—not even a dent!

“Brother Yang, now you can be sure, right? That really was an expert!” Qin Chaoyang laughed at Yang Kai’s failed attempt. “I’ve doubted it many times over the years, but no matter what I tried, I couldn’t damage this token. If not for that, I wouldn’t have kept it.”

“That really is a true master!” Yang Kai breathed, a chill running through him as his expression shifted.

Who knew what power that mysterious expert had imbued into the token to make ordinary wood so tough. Even an Emperor Realm cultivator couldn’t do such a thing.

At this, Yang Kai no longer doubted. He solemnly returned the token to Qin Chaoyang and asked, “How do I use this token to enter the Four Seasons Realm?”

Qin Chaoyang replied, “That expert told me to go to Qingyang Shrine and ask them for a spot to enter.”

“I see!” Yang Kai nodded in understanding.

Qingyang Shrine was a top sect in the Southern Territory, second only to Star God Palace in strength and prestige. Such a sect surely had many entry spots, so Qin Chaoyang using the token to obtain one made sense.

Still, it was unclear what connection the token’s owner had with Qingyang Shrine.

“Is the Four Seasons Realm about to open?” Yang Kai asked.

“It should be!” Qin Chaoyang nodded, thinking for a moment. “I suspect all of this was foreseen by that expert. When Yu’er was five, he gave me this token and told me to go to Qingyang Shrine twelve years later. I don’t know exactly when the Four Seasons Realm will open—Fenglin City never gets such news. But it seems that time is now.”

“Brother Qin, you want me to go to the Four Seasons Realm and look for the Calamity Fruit, right?”

Qin Chaoyang smiled bitterly. “If I had half your strength, I wouldn’t trouble you. I know my own limits—though I’m Dao Origin Realm, I’m far weaker than the elite disciples of the great sects. If I went in myself... I’d never come out alive. My death doesn’t matter, but Yu’er... I can only ask this of you.”

“When do we leave?” Yang Kai asked directly.

Qin Chaoyang was surprised. “Brother Yang, you’re agreeing?”

Yang Kai grinned. “Why wouldn’t I? Since you’re willing to give me this rare opportunity, how could I not seize it? I’ve always wanted to see the secret realms of the Southern Territory!”

As he spoke, Yang Kai’s eyes shone with longing.

This time, Qin Chaoyang was entrusting him to enter the Four Seasons Realm and seek the Calamity Fruit, but from another perspective, it was a stroke of fortune!

The elite disciples of all the great sects were scrambling to enter that secret realm, so there must be plenty of treasures inside.

Not to mention the heaven-and-earth treasures hidden within—let alone the countless outstanding young talents. It was the perfect chance to test his own strength.

“Excellent!” Qin Chaoyang hadn’t expected Yang Kai to agree so readily. He’d worried about being refused, but there was no need. Overjoyed, he said excitedly, “I don’t know exactly when the Four Seasons Realm will open, but delays could cause trouble. If you’re free, let’s set out tomorrow. It’ll take more than ten days to reach Qingyang Shrine.”

“Alright.” Yang Kai nodded and stood up. “I’ll go prepare and come find you tomorrow.”

“It’s settled, then.”

Soon after, Yang Kai left the Qin Family and returned to the Zhang Family.

Not long after Yang Kai left, Qin Yu came to the secret room again. Seeing Qin Chaoyang’s expression, she understood and asked softly, “Patriarch, did Lord Yang agree?”

“He agreed very readily!” Qin Chaoyang said happily. “I didn’t even need to persuade him—Brother Yang is truly a straightforward man.”

“Did Patriarch tell him about the risks? In there, killing and treasure snatching are commonplace. The disciples of the great sects fight openly and in secret, and no one forbids it. Lord Yang may be strong, but he’s only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. What if...”

Qin Chaoyang fell silent at her words, then said after a long pause, “I don’t think Brother Yang is someone destined for an early death...”

“Since when did Patriarch start reading faces?” Qin Yu retorted.

Qin Chaoyang looked embarrassed. “There’s no other way... In Fenglin City, our Qin Family has no one trustworthy. Besides Brother Yang, I can’t think of anyone else. Or... should Patriarch go himself?”

Qin Yu’s face darkened. “If Patriarch went personally, you might never return. Our Qin Family just took over the Jiang Family’s business—if you leave, who will keep things running?”

After a moment, she added, “Forget it, Patriarch. Give Lord Yang our Qin Family’s Myriad Sword and teach him how to use it.”

“The Myriad Sword!” Qin Chaoyang’s face changed dramatically. “Yu’er, that’s our Qin Family’s ancestral...”

“I know the Myriad Sword is important, but no one in our Qin Family can wield that Imperial Treasure now. Lord Yang’s cultivation may be lacking, but with his strength, he should be able to use some of its power. Maybe it’ll help him survive in the Four Seasons Realm. Since he’s risking himself for our Qin Family, we can’t let him go empty-handed. Otherwise, I’d feel guilty.”

“Since you insist... fine. When he comes tomorrow, I’ll give him the Myriad Sword. I hope he understands your intentions!” Qin Chaoyang sighed, finally giving in.

Yang Kai returned to the Zhang Family and spoke to Zhang Ruoxi, telling her he’d be away for a while and that she should focus on cultivating.

Zhang Ruoxi looked reluctant, but she agreed at once without saying much. Even so, Yang Kai could tell the little girl was brimming with resolve, single-mindedly set on entering seclusion to cultivate and advance her realm.

After thinking it over, Yang Kai changed his mind. “Would you like to come with me?”

“Sir, you’re willing to take me?” Zhang Ruoxi’s beautiful eyes lit up in surprise.

“I don’t mind taking you, but you won’t be able to stay by my side,” Yang Kai said.

“Sir, I don’t understand,” Zhang Ruoxi replied, confused.

Yang Kai smiled, waved his hand, and wrapped her in Origin Qi. With a startled cry, Zhang Ruoxi was swept directly into the Small Xuan Realm.
