## Chapter 715 — Starry Sky

In the void, Yang Kai and Zhai Yao suddenly appeared; the instant they materialized, Zhai Yao hurriedly activated a defensive Secret Treasure — a layer of earth-yellow light forming a curtain that enveloped them both — and, with a grave expression, warned, "Brother Yang, do not leave the protective range of my Secret Treasure, or it will be life-threatening."

Yang Kai did not reply; he stood there, dumbstruck, staring at the scene before him.

Above, below, left and right—there was only nothingness, as if they stood within an endless abyss.

All around, stars dotted the expanse; some bodies emitted scorching solar energy, others a cold, lonely lunar chill. The light that washed over Yang Kai made him feel as if he were in a dream.

In this void it was not dark, yet the boundless, edge-less vastness filled Yang Kai with a sudden, deep unease.

There was no solid ground beneath their feet; the two of them floated lightly in midair. Mountains, Wangtian Cliff, the Thousand-Year Demon Flower—all had vanished. Behind them yawned a grim, dark mouth.

That was a Void Passage.

It seemed the pistil of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower served as the entrance to a Void Passage; Yang Kai had no idea to where he had been transported.

"Where is this?" Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

"The Starry Sky!" Zhai Yao drew a deep breath, his face animated as he turned to take in the surroundings.

"The Starry Sky?" Yang Kai's brow twitched as a realization struck him: "Is that legend true?"

"Of course it's true," Zhai Yao nodded heavily. "Most experts have heard rumors about the Starry Sky; the Tongxuan Continent has many items from the Starry Sky, but no one has ever actually reached it to see what it is. Who would have thought the Thousand-Year Demon Flower would be the key to reaching the Starry Sky?"

"This really is the Starry Sky? Not some Small Xuan Realm?" Yang Kai still found it hard to believe; he had been more inclined to think this was some wondrous Small Xuan Realm.

"As if I'd lie to you?" Zhai Yao chuckled. "My teacher told me this is the Starry Sky. See that vigorous planet below? That's the Tongxuan Continent where we come from!"

Yang Kai looked down and indeed saw beneath his feet a vast planet; yet from here it appeared no larger than a fist. He extended a hand, as if he might clasp it tightly.

A subtle, inexplicable feeling stirred in his heart.

"Why is it round?" Yang Kai frowned—he had not expected the Tongxuan Continent to take a circular form.

Wouldn't someone standing on the far side fall off? Yang Kai worried silently.

"That I don't know," Zhai Yao shrugged.

As they spoke, both of them suddenly became alert and turned to look toward the Void Passage behind them.

Zhai Yao even manipulated his defensive Secret Treasure, whisking Yang Kai aside.

The next moment, two people emerged from that Void Passage.

These two were the alchemists from the earlier teams; the instant they stepped out of the Void Passage they adopted battle stances.

Clearly they understood that to obtain the elixir of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower they would have to clash with Yang Kai and Zhai Yao.

Both were Spirit-Grade Upper-Level alchemists of some age and not low cultivation—both at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm—but due to the peculiar nature of alchemists their combat power was roughly only a bit above the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm and could not compare to true Transcendent Realm practitioners.

Yet facing two young men like Yang Kai and Zhai Yao, they showed no timidity and believed they could win.

Yang Kai let out a sinister laugh and was about to engage when Zhai Yao reached out to stop him, slowly shaking his head: "No need to fight them."

"Why?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Zhai Yao laughed aloud, "Because they're dead meat."

Saying that, he called across, "Friends, you'd better activate your defensive Secret Treasures quickly, or you'll die a miserable death."

The two frowned; upon taking in the scene they widened their eyes and were momentarily stunned.

They had no idea that emerging from the pistil of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower would place them in the Starry Sky.

The surrounding boundless, endless abyss filled them with utter terror.

Before they could calm themselves they felt waves of inexplicably powerful energy tearing at their bodies.

Their faces changed; they dared not hesitate and drew out their strongest defensive Secret Treasures to guard themselves.

Alchemists were not poor, so their treasures were decent—both had defensive Secret Treasures of Spirit-Grade Middle-Level or Upper-Level, the sort capable of withstanding a full strike from a Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm expert.

But in this Starry Sky such defenses could only postpone their deaths.

The inexplicable energy slammed into their defensive Secret Treasures, causing their light to flicker like a candle in wind and rain, constantly on the verge of being extinguished.

"Where is this?" one of them rasped.

"Who knows?" Zhai Yao was in no mood to kindly point the way; he waved cheerfully at them and departed with Yang Kai.

The two cast a hurried glance around and did not dare linger. As they prepared to return, the Void Passage behind them abruptly closed; when they looked again for Zhai Yao and Yang Kai, they were gone. Their faces turned ashen, eyes brimming with fear.

Faintly, Yang Kai thought he heard long, wailing screams. When he glanced back, the two were gone without a trace; even their defensive Secret Treasures had been smashed to fragments, flesh and blood hurled in all directions at terrifying speed.

"It seems some powerful force is traversing the Starry Sky," Yang Kai quickly realized the seriousness of the matter. The outer surface of the defensive Secret Treasure Zhai Yao had deployed indeed showed signs of attack, but its grade was very high, so there was no fear those attacks would breach its defense.

"Yes. The Starry Sky's power is not something we can endure. My teacher nearly died here long ago; if he hadn't by chance brought a defensive Secret Treasure, Tianzang Elder would not be with us today. Teacher said that to withstand the tearing of the Starry Sky's power you need at least the physical strength of someone at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, otherwise you must possess a defensive Secret Treasure of equal grade."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, curiosity about the Starry Sky's power stirring within him.

He had never imagined the legendary Starry Sky to be so perilous.

As they spoke, Zhai Yao suddenly stopped, grinning: "Found it."

He spoke while pointing to a spot not far off.

Yang Kai turned to look and his eyes brightened, "The Thousand-Year Demon Flower?"

There, an identical Thousand-Year Demon Flower to the one they'd seen earlier stood proudly blooming in the void — only shrunk countless times in scale, roughly the height of a child.

"Indeed, the true Thousand-Year Demon Flower!" Zhai Yao nodded. "Actually, the flower we saw on Wangtian Cliff was only its magnified projection. The Thousand-Year Demon Flower has some inexplicable link with the Tongxuan Continent; it can draw energy from it, and during that process its main body magnifies countless times and manifests on Wangtian Cliff — those energies actually flow into this place."

At this moment the Thousand-Year Demon Flower was tenderly green and in bloom; at the center of its pistil lay a few crystal-clear, gem-like droplets of liquid, resting quietly, while an intoxicating fragrance drifted through the void and soothed body and mind.

"Brother Yang, go collect them. Those elixirs don't need refining; as long as you find the flower's main body you can take them directly. This is the essence of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower — a divine medicine of tremendous use for a Transcendent Realm cultivator seeking to advance to the Saint Realm!" Zhai Yao explained.

Yang Kai nodded and together they approached the flower. He counted carefully and his face lit up: there were six crystal droplets lying in the pistil.

"Not a small number — looks like your luck's good, Brother Yang," Zhai Yao chuckled. "Last time when my teacher came it only had three drops; I was worried your senior uncles wouldn't have enough to share. Now it seems there are two extra."

"Those two drops are yours," Yang Kai said as he took out a jade vial and carefully collected the liquid.

"I don't need them," Zhai Yao shook his head. "We agreed the elixir would all be yours. Besides, even if I took them they wouldn't help — my teacher is already in the Saint Realm. As for me... I want to advance to the Saint Realm by my own merits, not by external aid."

Yang Kai looked at him and nodded, "Then I won't be polite."

Zhai Yao was clearly confident in his own potential, believing that with his aptitude he could ascend to the Saint Realm without outside assistance.

Yang Kai felt the same!

When he had broken through realms he had never relied on external help, only his own insight and effort; doing so made his foundation steady, whereas relying on outside forces might bring hazards later.

But unlike Zhai Yao, who only had Elder Li as family, Yang Kai had many relatives; those extra two drops might prove useful.

Having collected the six droplets, Yang Kai was in high spirits and asked, "How do we get back now?"

"There is another Void Passage nearby that leads to the Tongxuan Continent; as long as we find it we can return, but my teacher didn't tell me exactly where—he wanted me to find it myself," Zhai Yao said with a sneer. "Still, even if we find it I'm not in a hurry to go back."

"Why?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"It's a rare opportunity, Brother Yang," Zhai Yao said with excitement. "This is the Starry Sky; all around flows the Starry Sky's power, which contains countless Laws of the Heavenly Dao. Training here for a single day is worth half a year below. If one can glean insight here, the benefits last a lifetime!"

Yang Kai's eyes lit and he asked eagerly, "Truly?"

Zhai Yao nodded earnestly.

"Then what are we waiting for?" Yang Kai could not contain himself; he immediately sat cross-legged and began to circulate his cultivation method.

Zhai Yao gave a short laugh, "Not so fast. My Saint-Grade Secret Treasure is shielding us; the Starry Sky's power can't flow in. Wait a moment — I'll let the Starry Sky's power in so we can cultivate."

Saying this, his expression turned serious as he controlled his defensive Secret Treasure and opened a narrow slit.
