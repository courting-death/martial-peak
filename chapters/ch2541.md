## Chapter 2541 — The Great Waves Wash Away the Sand

The man at the cave entrance, flustered and furious, shouted, “Miss, are you trying to stand up for someone else? Have you considered whether this is worth it? As far as I can see, you don’t even know this person, do you? Why offend others for his sake?”

Zhang Ruoxi snorted softly, “I don’t know if it’s worth it. I just can’t stand it, and when I can’t stand it, I have to act.”

“Utterly unreasonable!” The man outside the cave was enraged, his temper erupting like a volcano, nearly setting him ablaze. Truly, his luck was rotten—he had no idea where this meddlesome little girl had popped out from, so eager to interfere in other people’s business, and at such a critical moment.

If it were any other day, he might have had the patience to argue with Zhang Ruoxi for a while, but right now, he had no such leisure.

At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly lifted his gaze and glanced at the man at the cave entrance, speaking calmly, “The wind outside is getting stronger. If you don’t find another shelter soon, I’m afraid it’ll be too late.”

Hearing this, the man stared deeply at Yang Kai, his eyes full of venom. Suddenly, he turned and sped away, vanishing in an instant—he didn’t even have time to spit out a threat.

He knew that if he kept tangling with Zhang Ruoxi, he’d miss his best chance—and might not even secure a spot in the cave. If that happened, he’d surely die in the howling wind. Leaving now was his only shot at survival, however slim.

He could only gamble.

“Thank you, Miss! I’ll never forget your life-saving kindness today. I’ll repay you handsomely someday!” The young man hiding in the deepest part of the cave kept bowing to Zhang Ruoxi, his gratitude overflowing.

If Zhang Ruoxi hadn’t stood up for him just now, he would have been thrown out of the cave to fend for himself, so he was extremely grateful to her.

Zhang Ruoxi waved her hand and smiled, “It’s nothing.”

That smile seemed to brighten the entire cave. The young man’s eyes went wide, his face full of awe.

Noticing his awestruck gaze, Zhang Ruoxi’s cheeks flushed slightly, her heart secretly annoyed.

Old Ban coughed lightly and gave a wry smile, “Miss, your kindness is admirable. But… it’s not much use.”

“What?” Zhang Ruoxi turned to Old Ban, her face puzzled.

Old Ban sighed, “When the wind howls, this refuge becomes a battleground for all martial artists. You can drive one person away, but can you drive them all?”

As soon as he finished speaking, several sharp sounds came from outside.

Immediately after, several figures shot out of the strange mist like rainbows, rushing straight to the cave entrance.

These people were clearly also seeking shelter. When they looked inside and saw the cave packed with people, their faces darkened.

But they seemed to have expected this, so they didn’t hesitate or waste words. They immediately summoned their Secret Treasures and unleashed their fiercest attacks on those standing at the cave’s edge.

Light flashed and Spiritual Qi surged chaotically, accompanied by two agonized screams.

Of the martial artists at the cave’s edge, two didn’t even have time to react before they were killed on the spot, blood splattering everywhere. The stench filled the air instantly.

Among the newcomers, someone laughed loudly and casually kicked the two corpses out, shouting, “If you don’t want to die, hurry up and make room for your masters!”

As soon as he finished, their attacks grew even fiercer, making those at the edge cry out in misery.

Zhang Ruoxi watched in shock, instantly understanding why there were so many bones at the cave entrance.

So these bones weren’t left by the wind—those people were killed by others. Every time the wind howled, countless fights broke out in this cave. People died here again and again, year after year. It was no wonder this place was known as martial artists’ grave.

If this cave was like this, the others were probably the same.

This wasn’t just sparring—it was a true life-and-death struggle. Everyone knew that if they couldn’t secure a spot in the cave, they’d die in the wind sooner or later, so every move was ruthless and deadly.

For a while, the battle at the entrance was chaotic, sand and stones flying everywhere.

The fighting here wasn’t even over when more people rushed in from outside, attacking fiercely without a word.

The battle was utter chaos. People screamed and died, the ground stained crimson with blood, severed limbs and corpses everywhere, and the thick stench of blood made people want to vomit.

The great waves wash away the sand—only the truly formidable experts could survive this chaos. Anyone slightly weaker had no chance.

These experts forced their way past the entrance, fiercely squeezing inward, as if trying to reach the cave’s depths.

Only by squeezing into the depths could one truly rest easy. Staying outside just made you a target for newcomers.

In no time, the whole cave was in complete disorder.

The fighting at the entrance was intense, and inside the cave, the sounds of battle and killing filled the air. Secret Treasures and secret techniques flashed everywhere. Everyone around seemed like an enemy—there wasn’t a single companion.

Yang Kai and the other two had been in the deep right side of the cave, but now they too were caught up in the fighting.

But after Yang Kai casually killed two Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts who tried to attack Zhang Ruoxi and Old Ban, things improved a bit. The martial artists who rushed in from outside must have realized Yang Kai was not to be trifled with, so they instinctively avoided his area, leaving Zhang Ruoxi and Old Ban in peace as well.

From time to time, martial artists were thrown out by stronger people. As time passed, less than half of the original dozen or so people remained in the cave—the rest were all newcomers.

The wind howled, growing stronger.

Suddenly, those martial artists who hadn’t managed to get inside the cave cried out in terror, their faces twisted with fear as they desperately tried to rush in, but were blocked by others.

In full view, the exposed flesh of these people was sliced away as if by invisible knives, revealing bone and sinew beneath.

Their screams were utterly miserable, the horrifying scene making everyone’s scalp tingle and limbs go cold.

Everyone hiding in the cave instinctively stepped back.

In less than ten breaths, those still outside the cave were reduced to skeletons—their clothes and flesh gone, white bones scattered everywhere with a clattering sound.

“Now it’s safe.”

After a long time, Old Ban finally let out a breath.

The full power of the howling wind was on display. Anyone who hadn’t found shelter by now was basically doomed, all dying in the wind. So no one would try to force their way in anymore, and the dozen or so martial artists still hiding in the cave could finally stop worrying about losing their spots.

Strangely, before, everyone fought as if each person was an enemy, more or less crossing swords with others, as if they had deep grudges and wanted to kill each other.

But now, everyone relaxed, their hostility fading. They exchanged glances and sat down to meditate.

As if nothing had happened.

The earlier fighting was to secure a place to survive—a life-and-death struggle. Now that the crisis had passed, there was no need to keep fighting. Everyone understood this.

Zhang Ruoxi looked around but didn’t see the young man she’d saved earlier. She sighed, knowing he must have been killed or thrown out in the chaos.

Old Ban had said her actions were useless, and it turned out he was right.

She could save that young man once, but she couldn’t keep him safe forever. On the martial path, only one’s own strength is true capital.

Of the dozen or so people left in the cave, apart from Old Ban, who was at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the rest were all at the Second Stage, with most being Third Stage—mostly newcomers, each with a fierce aura.

The earlier battle had drained many, so now everyone was meditating to recover. The cave was silent, except for the terrifying howling outside, making people worry the wind might blow in.

The wind showed no sign of stopping—if anything, it grew fiercer.

Two hours later, as Yang Kai was meditating, he suddenly frowned and looked toward the cave entrance.

For some reason, he felt a faint unease.

But outside the cave, strange mist and howling wind made it impossible to sense anything, even with his Divine Sense, so he had no idea what was happening out there.

As he focused, a wailing sound suddenly came from deep within the mist. Though distorted by the wind, everyone heard it clearly.

Every pair of eyes snapped open, all looking forward in alarm and uncertainty.

“Everyone… did you hear something?” asked one of the martial artists closest to the entrance, frowning.

“Ghosts!” another replied in a deep voice.

“Hmph, there are always ghosts in the ancient passage. What’s so strange? Who knows how many people die here every year—it’s normal for ghosts to appear.”

“I know there are always ghosts in the passage, but… don’t you feel like they’re coming toward us?” the first speaker asked, uneasy.

“Haha, you must be joking. When the wind howls, not only do we living people need shelter, but ghosts usually hide away too. Why would they come toward us?”

“That’s right. I’ve been here for years and never seen ghosts during the wind. Maybe you’re overthinking it?”

“True!” The man thought for a moment and agreed, no longer worrying.
