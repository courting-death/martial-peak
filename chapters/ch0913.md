## Chapter 913 — Half a Sentence Too Many

Recalling everything they had experienced in that bizarre space, the two Great Yao Lords felt a chill run down their spines.

Whether it was that emerald ocean, that towering sea of blood, or those final eight stone pillars, each hid unimaginable power; even if one could withstand the first two seals at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, one would still be powerless before those last pillars.

The measures set down countless years ago were astonishing—how much greater, then, must that Great Demon God's true cultivation be?

Lei Long and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox could hardly imagine it!

In the face of that legend, they suddenly felt childishly weak and were painfully aware of their own shortcomings.

“Who knows how strong he truly is,” Yang Kai said with a rueful smile. “He might even surpass the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—beyond the Saint Realm there could be yet higher levels.”

“Higher levels?” Lei Long's eyes narrowed. “Why have I never heard of them?”

“Ten years ago I didn't even know there was a Transcendent Realm above the Divine Roaming Realm. In my territory the top experts didn't even know the name Transcendent Realm, let alone the Saint Realm.”

The Great Lord Lei Long stared at Yang Kai in surprise, then his mouth twitched for a long moment. “Exactly which God-forsaken backwater are you from that news reaches you so late?”

“Let's not talk about that—how are the two of you recovering?” Yang Kai asked.

“Almost fine. Do you still have the pills you gave us? They don't look like much, but they replenish strength unbelievably well—give me more, will you? Refining pills is no trouble for your Nine Heavens Sacred Land anyway.” Lei Long asked without the slightest courtesy.

The four yao had trekked and struggled through that strange realm and gained nothing, almost losing their lives, while Yang Kai had returned with great gains.

Li Rong had glimpsed an opportunity and advanced to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, and Yang Kai had found and rescued an elder and his senior sister whom he hadn't seen in ten years.

Lei Long felt it would be unfair not to receive any reward after such a grueling expedition.

“We'll settle it when we return—I'll give you some Spirit-Grade Pills.” Yang Kai was generous, understanding their disappointment at coming away empty-handed.

“Good—I'll await the good news.” Lei Long laughed with satisfaction.

“Don't forget Old Ox's share!” the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox stuck its head forward.

“I won't forget.” Yang Kai nodded. “From now on we'll be neighbors, and we'll still rely on you two Great Lords.”

“You're welcome, you're welcome—hahaha!”

After chatting for a while, Lei Long and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox resumed recuperation, waiting for Caidie and Jin Ni to recover.

Yang Kai stayed by Xia Ningshang's side, glancing occasionally at Meng Wuya's condition, his spirits high.

Ten years apart, the little senior sister hadn't changed much—if anything she had grown noticeably fuller and rounder; clad in black, her exquisite figure was outlined perfectly as she lay on the ground, her breath rising and falling in an alluring rhythm.

Yang Kai couldn't help stealing a few more looks.

The sweet fragrance emanating from his little senior sister filled his nostrils and put him at ease.

“Master... this girl seems to be waking,” Li Rong quietly transmitted by divine sense.

Yang Kai was startled, studying her closely; indeed, the long lashes trembled slightly, her breathing was uneven, and the heartbeat through her chest was stronger than usual.

“When did you notice?” Yang Kai replied.

“When you were talking with Lei Long and the others.”

“At that moment...” Yang Kai thought for a moment, then laughed in surprise. “Pretend you didn't see anything.”

Li Rong lightly inclined her head, puzzled by whatever was going on between Yang Kai and his senior sister. After ten years apart, one would expect joy at a true reunion—why not open one's eyes?

Yang Kai, however, looked at Xia Ningshang with a face full of satisfaction and a smile at the corner of his mouth.

The little senior sister hadn't changed much—ten years hadn't improved her acting of feigned sleep; the technique still had room for refinement.

Half a day later, Caidie and Jin Ni recovered in turn. But remembering the torment and helplessness they had suffered among those pillars still left them shaken.

They had never imagined that, despite their cultivation and ability, there could exist places in the world so perilous.

Jin Ni went out to scout and confirmed this place was not the Beast Sea Great Forest; after returning to report this everyone froze.

“Then what is this place?” Yang Kai asked.

“There is a small town a hundred li away. I inquired there and learned this place is two months' journey from your Nine Heavens Sacred Land... at the pace of someone in the Transcendent Realm.”

“Two months?” Yang Kai exclaimed.

Lei Long and the others couldn't make sense of it either; they had entered from the Beast Sea Great Forest but emerged here, and in the end they blamed it on the Void Passage they used to leave.

Perhaps the void rift they went through was not the same as the one they entered.

“That place is strange—I entered from the Demon Domain side,” Meng Wuya's voice came, hoarse from just having recovered.

“Shopkeeper Meng.” Yang Kai straightened and looked toward him.

Meng Wuya smiled and inclined his head. “I didn't expect the one who rescued me this time to be you, kid—I'll have to find a chance to properly thank you.”

Yang Kai grinned. “We're family—let's not make a fuss about it.”

Meng Wuya's face darkened; he coughed a few times and said, “You may eat as you please, but don't speak so recklessly—since when did we become a family?”

He was clearly unwilling to admit Xia Ningshang favored Yang Kai.

“And who are these?” Meng Wuya asked, regaining a serious expression as he looked at Lei Long and the others.

The four yao experts stared at Meng Wuya with grave expressions, not daring to be careless.

Before them stood a figure once hailed as the strongest among humans—he had defeated Great Lord Blood Jiao in the time it took a single incense stick to burn. Not every human was as tolerant as Yang Kai; if this old man hated yao, they could be in danger.

They had to be cautious.

“These four are my friends among the yao!” Yang Kai quickly introduced them to Meng Wuya.

“So they're yao—no wonder the yao qi is so strong.” Meng Wuya nodded, then eyed Lei Long with suspicion. “Have we met somewhere? You look familiar.”

The Great Lord Lei Long said in a deep voice, “Five hundred years ago, in the Beast Sea Great Forest!”

Meng Wuya frowned and, seeing Lei Long's cool attitude toward him, wondered what he had done to offend him. Then a thought struck him: “So you were one of Blood Jiao's underlings?”

“As long as you remember.” Lei Long smiled lightly. “I will avenge Great Lord Blood Jiao's death for sure.”

Meng Wuya chuckled, “It wasn't me who killed him. He was too thin-skinned—after losing one fight he couldn't take it. Who can we blame?”

“Don't you dare insult Great Lord Blood Jiao!” Lei Long sprang to his feet and roared.

Seeing the two escalating, Yang Kai hurried to mediate.

If they actually fought now he'd be caught in the middle, and Meng Wuya had only just recovered—this was no time for combat.

“No use saying more when we don’t see eye to eye.” Lei Long snorted, looking at Yang Kai. “Kid, we'll be going first. Don't forget the Spirit-Grade Pills you promised me.”

“Mm, I remember.” Yang Kai nodded.

The four yao soon departed and were gone in the blink of an eye.

Meng Wuya, wearing an expression of mild disdain, sneered, “You little brat—ten years gone and you've grown a bit; you've even made friends with such formidable figures.”

“It's all thanks to Shopkeeper Meng's teachings back then.” Yang Kai hurriedly replied.

“Don't flatter me!” Meng Wuya rolled his eyes. “Don't think I don't know what you're up to—you were born restless, always getting into trouble; I worry for Ningshang following you.”

“Following you isn't exactly safe either.” Yang Kai teased.

Meng Wuya was momentarily at a loss for words and quickly changed the subject, looking at Li Rong. “What is this lady called?”

Yang Kai introduced her at once.

Meng Wuya glanced at Li Rong and his suspicion deepened. “I feel this lady's cultivation method is somewhat unusual.”

He spoke obliquely—Li Rong's mind was sharp and she understood his meaning. She pursed her lips and smiled. “Senior, if you observe closely, I'm actually of the demon race.”

Meng Wuya's expression stiffened; he transmitted a low-throated warning: “Kid, what are you doing? Associating with yao and with demons? Haven't you heard the saying 'those not of our kind are likely to harbor different intentions'?”

Before Yang Kai could answer, Li Rong said, “Senior, if you're worried I might harm the master, you're mistaken—my people have sworn to obey and serve him for life.”

“Master?” Meng Wuya almost popped his eyes out. He looked at Li Rong, then at Yang Kai, and asked uncertainly, “You call him Master?”

“Yes.” Li Rong inclined her head solemnly.

Meng Wuya's expression shifted, and after a long while he said to Yang Kai, “We'll have a proper talk when there's a chance.”

Ten years had passed, and seeing Yang Kai in league with yao and demons worried Meng Wuya. Those creatures were far stronger than Yang Kai; a casual gesture could kill him.

“Let's talk about it after we return.” Yang Kai grinned, knowing Meng Wuya was serious because he cared.

“I'll give this to you, but most of the blood qi inside has been consumed.” Meng Wuya handed over the Blood Essence Stone.

Yang Kai took it and felt it, his face paling slightly. “Shopkeeper Meng, what is your current cultivation? How could so much blood qi be reduced to this?”

Meng Wuya smiled. “Before entering that place I was only at the First Stage of the Saint Realm; now, though... I've recovered. It's thanks to the torment and scourging on those pillars—the energies destroyed the seal within me and saved me the trouble of unsealing it myself.”

Yang Kai's expression changed and he rejoiced. “So your seal has been completely lifted?”

“Mm,” Meng Wuya nodded.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened with genuine delight for Shopkeeper Meng's recovery.
