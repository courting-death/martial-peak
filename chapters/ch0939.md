## Chapter 939 — Everyone Has Their Fate

Zhongdu was a bustle of activity; people from the Yang Family, Qiu Family, and Huo Family were all packing their things. Although Yang Kai had ordered everyone to keep things simple, moving so many people at once still took a great deal of time.

Yang Kai waited in Zhongdu for a full ten days before everything was finally in order.

At a single command, nearly a thousand people from the three great families set out in a grand procession toward Lingxiao Pavilion.

Of course, the three families numbered far more than that in total, but no matter the household, some people were reluctant to leave Zhongdu and volunteered to stay behind. The Yang Family’s situation was better—about ninety percent followed Yang Kai; those left were mostly elders who refused to travel long distances.

The Huo and Qiu families left at least half their people behind. Only the direct lines, under the strict orders of Huo Xingchen and Qiu Yimeng, joined the traveling party without exception.

Yang Kai’s friends were in the procession as well; they had already sent word back to their respective sects. How those sects would respond depended on their elders’ decisions.

Yang Kai had already told anyone willing to go to the Tongxuan Continent to head straight to Lingxiao Pavilion; he would wait there for a time, but only for a limited window.

Outside Zhongdu’s gates, the procession stretched into the distance. Many people gathered at the gate, watching the departing column with complicated expressions.

Most of those gathered were members of the city’s other five families.

“Brother Meng, was it right for us to stay?” Kang Jian, head of the Kang Family, asked with a bewildered look as he watched the thousand-strong column recede, unexpectedly feeling a twinge of envy.

Those people were heading to a higher world, to better places, while they were stuck guarding Zhongdu, unable to join them.

Meng Shanyi, head of the Meng Family, shook his head and sighed: “I don’t know if staying is right or not. We’ve never been that close with Yang Kai. Even if we went with him, it wouldn’t necessarily be better. If he has resources or treasures, he’ll prioritize the Yang, the Qiu, and the Huo families. Our five families won’t be valued; we might even be pushed aside or absorbed.”

Ye Jingli, head of the Ye Family, nodded in agreement. “Brother Meng is right. For that reason we refused his invitation. I think he understands our concerns, so he didn’t press it.”

“Maybe we’re overthinking it,” Kang Jian hesitated. “If it’s truly a higher place, with our families’ capital, Yang Kai might not even bother with us. Perhaps his invitation was only a courteous gesture.”

“You can think whatever you want—now that we’ve refused, we can hardly catch up to them.”

“Brother Liu, what do you think?” Gao Rangxian, head of the Gao Family, turned his gaze to Liu Qingyao, seeking his opinion.

Liu Qingyao had once been the top young master in Zhongdu; among those present, his opinion still carried weight.

“I have no opinion.” Liu Qingyao shook his head slowly and refused to say another word.

……

Ten li outside Zhongdu, Yang Kai walked shoulder to shoulder with Huo Xingchen and Qiu Yimeng.

Huo Xingchen glanced back and asked, “Young Master Kai, aren’t you concerned about those people?”

“How could I be? They don’t want to follow me. I can’t force them. Everyone has their fate—let nature take its course.”

Qiu Yimeng rolled her eyes at Huo Xingchen. “It’s their choice—why worry about it?”

Huo Xingchen gave a nervous chuckle. “I’m not really worried for them; it’s just that we’ve lived together in Zhongdu for so many years, and suddenly we leave—there’s a bit of reluctance. Never mind, I won’t bother with them. Come, Young Master Kai, let me introduce you to my fifteen concubines and principal wife. They’re all very interested in you and insist I make introductions.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “Let’s not.”

Meeting a dozen or so sisters-in-law is a hassle; what if they demand gifts or favors for an introduction?

“You can’t avoid it—if you don’t go, they’ll hold me accountable tonight,” Huo Xingchen complained.

Yang Kai was about to give in when his brow suddenly furrowed. He turned his head and stared in one direction; his expression grew serious.

“My lord!” Li Rong cried out softly nearby.

“I know.” Yang Kai nodded once, then hurriedly said, “Huo, Qiu, you two lead the main body onward with the troops. I’ll be right back!”

Saying that, he vanished in a flash.

Li Rong and Han Fei exchanged a glance and hurried after him.

Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen stood frozen, bewildered by how the two had suddenly bolted.

“What’s Kai gone off to do?” Dong Suzhu hurried over and asked.

“I don’t know—he seems to have discovered something,” Qiu Yimeng said, thoughtful.

“Could it be dangerous?” Dong Suzhu asked with deep concern.

“Don’t worry, aunt. Yang Kai has two powerful guards with him. I’m not sure how strong they are, but they should be formidable.” Qiu Yimeng smiled to reassure her.

Hearing that, Dong Suzhu relaxed.

Fourth Master Yang chuckled: “He’s grown up—why do you still fuss over him? Let him do as he pleases; he knows his own limits.”

The procession continued. Aside from a few nearby people who noticed Yang Kai’s absence, most were unaware.

A hundred li away from the procession.

Two lights—one blood-red, one black—came speeding toward them.

Both raced at terrifying speed; their power was clearly high. As they flew, they emitted murderous auras that withered every tree they passed, as if ages of decay had been condensed into an instant and all vitality was sucked dry.

All creatures that sensed the horrifying aura trembled and curled up in place; those with weaker minds died in panic.

That kind of murderous qi was something cultivators of this world could not bear.

“Huh…” a startled cry came from the dark shadow, which then stalled in midair and revealed a towering figure. The moment he appeared, a mountain-like might emanated from him.

The blood-red light halted beside him. Graceful and lithe, it belonged to a woman.

“Someone beat us here?” the hulking man frowned, interest flickering across his face. “And a member of my demon race, no less—could it be Gou Chi?”

The woman shook her head. “Doesn’t look like Gou Chi. If Gou Chi had come, he would have moved with us, not come alone.”

“Not Gou Chi? Who else among my demon race could have such cultivation?” the man muttered doubtfully, then his expression shifted. “Wait—there’s a human here too. This human’s aura feels oddly familiar, as if I’ve seen them before.”

He murmured to himself but couldn’t place where he had seen the human.

While he was puzzled, the graceful woman’s face changed and she snapped, “I know who it is.”

“Who?”

The woman let out a faint, cold laugh. “Truly, enemies are fated to meet… so it’s that woman.”

“Be more specific!” the man snapped impatiently.

The woman glanced at him coldly and said, “Do you remember when I was injured a couple of years ago?”

The man grinned maliciously. “You mean when you trespassed into human territory and were beaten by human experts? Of course I remember. Is this related to that woman?”

The woman ground her teeth. “It’s more than related. The one who fought me then was her—she, a member of the demon race, sided with humanity against us, a disgrace to our people.”

The man’s brow lifted and he sneered: “Then today you’ll have a chance to avenge yourself!”

The woman warned coldly, “She’s not weak. Back then she was already at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm and held her own against me.”

“How is that possible? Are you delusional?” the man flew into a rage. “You’re a demon general—how could you not defeat someone one realm below you?”

“She’s not like ordinary people. If I’m not mistaken, she belongs to that clan.”

“Which clan?”

The woman looked at him darkly. “The clan that once served the Great Demon God.”

The man’s face changed; he seemed wary. After a long pause he asked, “Are you sure she’s from that clan?”

“I fought her. The powers she used were the Demon God Transformation passed down to that clan by the Great Demon God.”

“Is that so? That clan still has bloodlines left?” the man brightened as if he’d discovered a treasure, greed dawning in his eyes. “Meng Ge, are you interested in her?”

The woman glanced at him and asked casually.

“I’m not interested in her, I’m interested in the Demon God Transformation!” the man named Meng Ge chuckled.

“I’m interested too,” the woman giggled. “We’ll join forces. There are three people coming—two are remnants of that clan, one is human. You and I take one each of the clan’s heirs, and as for the human…”

“You’re interested in a human?” Meng Ge looked surprised and wary. “Xueli, what are you scheming? What’s so special about that human?”

From his understanding of the viperish woman, he knew she wouldn’t bother unless the human was extraordinary. The human’s cultivation was only at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm—tiny as an ant before two demon generals, easily slain.

Xueli laughed coyly. “Meng Ge, you’re overthinking. That human once escaped from my Sand City and embarrassed me badly. I want him brought back to be properly tormented, to vent my humiliation.”

Meng Ge froze briefly as the memory returned.

Back then a human escaped Xueli’s Sand City; the incident caused much gossip in the Demon Domain. The other demon generals teased Xueli about it, making her a laughingstock and infuriating her.

“Do as you like,” Meng Ge waved impatiently. “Just don’t harm my interests, or don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

Xueli nodded in satisfaction, a furtive gleam flashing through her eyes.
