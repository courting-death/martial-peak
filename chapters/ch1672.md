## Chapter 1672 — Kill Yourselves

The child hoisted up was only about two to three years old, white and chubby, carved like a miniature jade figure—truly adorable to behold.

But being handled so roughly, the child naturally burst into loud cries, flailing his arms and legs wildly in the air.

Among the crowd below, a man of about thirty suddenly trembled when he heard the child’s cries. His eyes quivered as he stared at the boy, and he let out a hoarse, anguished shout: “My child!”

That three-year-old was, astonishingly, his own flesh and blood.

A few days ago the child had inexplicably disappeared from home; he had no idea who had abducted his son.

Only now did he realize that the ones who had stolen his beloved child were, in fact, people from Yingyue Hall.

Could the rumors actually be true?

Recently in Tianyun City many children under the age of five and young, beautiful maidens had vanished without a trace; their families searched everywhere but found nothing. Privately everyone speculated that Yingyue Hall was behind it—after all, in this little patch of land only Yingyue Hall possessed the strength and means to do such things.

But suspicion was one thing and evidence another, and Yingyue Hall now was not what it had been before; nobody dared to confront them. People could only bite their tongues, swallow their anger, endure in silence, and weep quietly.

Now that his child had suddenly appeared before him, the middle-aged man was naturally overcome and immediately lunged forward.

His cultivation was low—only Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm—far from reaching the saintly thresholds.

Ordinarily he would never dare act so rashly in front of the experts from Yingyue Hall, but a father’s love knows no reason; he ignored all caution.

With a single bound he leapt from the ground and shot toward the high platform.

“How dare you!” a fierce shout came, and a streak of light flashed; the man in midair uttered a muffled groan as a bloody hole opened in his chest. By the time he hit the ground he was already a corpse.

A clamor erupted; the onlookers trembled in fear, faces pale with terror.

“Such insolence before Lord Fang—how dare you! The next to offend will see a hundred executed!” roared the warrior who had struck first.

The residents of Tianyun City seethed with righteous fury but dared not speak.

At this moment the three-year-old child was brought before the youth surnamed Fang.

The youth sized the child up and down, a look of satisfaction appearing on his face, then gave a light wave of his hand.

Immediately a young woman dressed like a married lady, her face heavy with makeup, emerged from behind him. She twisted her waist like a sea serpent, a cold, seductive smile at the corner of her mouth.

“What do you intend to do?” Fei Zhi Tu suddenly spoke up.

He stood on the high platform; though he could not use his own power, his gaze remained sharp as he stared at the youth.

The youth curled his lip and said nothing—clearly he thought a jailed man like Fei Zhi Tu had no right to address him.

Instead one of the Yingyue Hall traitors nearby sneered, “Senior Brother Fei, you’d do well to keep your mouth shut. Quietly savoring the last moments of your life might suit you better.”

After that taunt he no longer paid Fei Zhi Tu any heed.

The young woman came up to the child, seized the tender wrist with her hand, and licked her bloody-red lips with a scarlet tongue—utterly enticing. She parted her vermilion lips and laughed coquettishly, “Such tender blood; Master will surely be pleased.”

“Do it,” the youth surnamed Fang said noncommittally.

The woman complied; with a flourish a dagger that shone with a cold light appeared in her hand. She lightly sliced the child’s wrist and red blood immediately flowed from the wound.

In her other hand she produced a glazed golden goblet and placed it beneath the child’s wrist to catch the blood.

Drip… drip…

The sound of blood splattering and the child’s piercing cries tugged at everyone’s heartstrings. The watching crowd was filled with righteous indignation, their eyes blazing.

“You have no conscience! You ought to die!” Fei Zhi Tu roared, struggling as he tried to rush forward to save the child, but he barely made two steps before a warrior on the platform slammed him down and kicked him hard several times.

The youth surnamed Fang glanced coldly at Fei Zhi Tu and sneered, “A defeated lackey—what right have you to speak to me? But don’t worry, this is only the beginning for you; once I sever your head, I shall grant you new life!”

His words were bizarre and many could not fathom them, but to Fei Zhi Tu they sounded like the voice of a demon. He lay prostrate on the ground, lifted his head, and howled, “Fang Fengqi, even if I die I will never let you off!”

The youth scoffed, “Once you become one of my Corpse Spirit Race, you won’t think that way; then you’ll be entitled to enjoy such blood feasts!”

As he spoke he took the glazed golden goblet brimming with blood from the woman’s hand, sniffed it under his nose, a look of intoxication on his face, then threw his head back and drank the warm cup of blood down in one gulp.

The onlookers were struck with horror.

Countless eyes stared dumbfounded at the blood at the corner of Fang Fengqi’s mouth; each person felt as if struck by lightning, frozen in place.

This man… actually drank blood? And what, exactly, was this Corpse Spirit Race he mentioned?

The scene exceeded their imagination—at this moment Fang Fengqi was, in everyone’s eyes, the very incarnation of a demon, the fountainhead of sin; many no longer even had the courage to look at him.

Fei Zhi Tu’s body trembled; his eyes shot with a hatred carved into his bones as he stared at Fang Fengqi as though he wished to tear him limb from limb.

“Not bad,” Fang Fengqi said, wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth. The sultry, bewitchingly dressed woman suddenly knelt before him, extending her crimson tongue to slowly lick his fingers clean of every trace of blood.

Strange, alluring sounds emanated from her throat.

The child who had been used as a blood vessel now looked listless, lacking the strength to cry; his little face was deathly pale as he was led away by a Saint King Realm warrior.

Though his life was not in immediate danger, suffering such a trauma at three years old would leave an indelible shadow on his soul that might never be erased.

“Enough, the time has come. Fei Zhi Tu, prepare to receive your new life. This is a special favor from the Sect Master; you should be grateful!” Fang Fengqi rose.

After drinking a goblet of blood his once-pale face took on an unnatural flush, radiating an extraordinarily strong aura.

Fei Zhi Tu laughed bitterly, “I, Fei Zhi Tu, swear here that even if I sink to become an evil ghost, I will hunt you beasts down and annihilate you—mark my words!”

His gaze swept over the Yingyue Hall traitors; those he fixed eyes upon trembled, their faces betraying dread.

“Well said!” a cold, furious voice suddenly rang from the void—utterly abrupt.

“Who!” Fang Fengqi’s expression changed drastically as he hurriedly looked up at the sky.

An ominous instinct prickled him. The newcomer’s strength seemed immense—able to reach under his very nose without being detected. Fang himself was already an expert of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; that the newcomer was not detected suggested their power might be at the peak of the Third Stage.

Fei Zhi Tu was stunned for a moment, then quickly burst into wild laughter.

He had recognized the voice. The speaker was Qian Tong!

A figure flickered in the void—Qian Tong appeared.

“Great Elder!” the Yingyue Hall traitors showed faces of terror and cried out in alarm.

“You’ve done well—at least you still remember there is a Great Elder above you,” Qian Tong said coolly, sweeping his gaze over the crowd below. Those traitors instantly felt as though a great mountain were pressing down from the heavens, leaving them almost unable to breathe.

Two streaks of light came speeding—Wei Guchang and Xuan’er arrived, closely following Qian Tong.

They immediately saw the battered figure of Fei Zhi Tu and shouted, “Uncle Fei!”

“Chang’er, Xuan’er!” Fei Zhi Tu looked at these rising talents of Yingyue Hall and breathed out heavily. He had been unable to contact Wei Guchang and Xuan’er for some time and had worried for their safety; seeing them unharmed eased a great burden in his chest.

“Go free your Uncle Fei,” Qian Tong ordered.

“Yes!” Wei Guchang and Xuan’er rushed up and reached the high platform.

The warrior guarding Fei Zhi Tu hesitated, unsure of how to respond. As he hesitated, Wei Guchang kicked him aside in one blow: “Get lost!”

“How dare you, Wei Guchang—be so brazen before Lord Fang!” someone loudly scolded.

Wei Guchang sneered and, while helping Xuan’er untie Fei Zhi Tu, scorned the man who had shouted: “Yuan Qi. I have long respected you, yet never expected you to be so cowardly and cling to life so much that you’ve become the enemy’s lapdog and even harmed Uncle Fei. Fine, very fine—today will be your death!”

The man named Yuan Qi’s face flushed green then red; he snapped back, “You whelp understand nothing—shut your mouth.”

Wei Guchang seemed about to speak further, but Qian Tong said calmly, “No need to waste words on them; there’s nothing to say to the dead.”

Wei Guchang considered for a moment and nodded, “The Great Elder speaks wisely.”

Yuan Qi, enraged, suddenly noticed what Qian Tong carried. He scrutinized it and his face changed dramatically, “Hall Master?”

Only at that moment did he realize that Qian Tong carried Xie Chen!

Xie Chen had no hands or feet!

And he was not yet dead—his expression writhed in agony as if devoured by ten thousand ants; his condition was grisly.

Hearing this, the others finally reacted. Looking at Xie Chen’s miserable fate as if it foretold their own, they grew cold and quietly edged closer to Fang Fengqi as if seeking some sliver of safety.

Qian Tong casually tossed Xie Chen’s torso onto the high platform and said coldly, “I do not wish to stain my hands with the blood of too many sect members. I’ll give you a chance—kill yourselves!”

Everyone’s bodies shuddered.

“Old ghost Qian, aren’t you speaking a bit too boldly? We should hurry and leave!” Fei Zhi Tu cried nervously.

Qian Tong was indeed formidable, but there were too many enemies here. He did not believe Qian Tong could handle them all; if Qian Tong were to fall here as well, he would not be able to die in peace.
