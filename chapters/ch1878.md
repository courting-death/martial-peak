## Chapter 1878 — Yang Leaves in Triumph

"Senior, should I keep making a scene?" In midair, Yang Kai, who had been confronting Kuang Shizong with a grin, looked at him calmly and asked, "If this keeps up, your Purple Star will probably be ruined... but it doesn't matter—Purple Star is vast, there are countless cities; if Purple Star City falls, there are others I can sweep through one by one. I reckon that'll keep me busy for a while..."

Those words sent a chill through everyone present.

If Yang Kai had said something like that before, most would have brushed it off as bluster, but after witnessing the terrifying combat power and destructive force of those strange things, no one dared doubt Yang Kai's capabilities anymore.

As long as he had enough patience, with that army of wondrous items at his command he could absolutely reduce the entire Purple Star to rubble!

All eyes turned to Kuang Shizong; virtually everyone wore a pleading expression.

They were genuinely frightened.

Yang Kai had been a handful, but up to now he had not gone on a slaughtering spree; if they truly pushed him to the brink and he fought back, few among them would survive.

"Enough!" Kuang Shizong shouted, anger boiling in his chest, though he had no choice but to roar.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "So, Senior, are you willing to talk with me?"

"You win!" Kuang Shizong said darkly, staring at Yang Kai with hatred carved into his eyes. "Take those people and get out of my Purple Star at once. If you ever set foot on my Purple Star again, I swear I will kill you with my own hand."

"Rest assured, Senior, I won't come back to Purple Star!" Yang Kai grinned broadly, entirely unconcerned by Kuang Shizong's vicious words — anyone half‑astute would know they were for show.

Yang Kai was a master of Spatial Force and a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert; in this whole Star Domain there was likely no one who could kill him, unless they trapped him somewhere and wore him down through endless attrition or sheer numbers—only then might they have a chance.

"I will not let this matter rest," Kuang Shizong said coldly, eyes fixed on Yang Kai as he spoke each word slowly. "Sooner or later I will personally go to Shuiyue Star and speak to Ai Ou."

Until that moment, he had still thought Yang Kai was connected to the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

"Shuiyue Star will welcome you!" Yang Kai replied with a smile. Then he called to Shen Tu, "Brother Shen Tu, everything is ready. You should leave first."

"And you?" Shen Tu frowned at Yang Kai, his face betraying a hint of worry.

"I'll stay to keep an eye on them." Yang Kai gestured downward. "If I left with you, they might strike at the warship. Don't worry, they can't stop me — I'll rendezvous with you later."

Shen Tu thought it over and seemed to agree with that reasoning. He did not try to persuade further. Instead, he cupped his fists and said, “In that case, Brother Yang, be careful. I’ll wait for you aboard the warship!”

Yang Kai nodded. “Be careful on your way.”

Shen Tu left without a backward glance. Several other Hengluo Commerce Guild fighters nodded thanks to Yang Kai and followed Shen Tu away.

Below, Xiaoxiao reverted to its small, harmless form, slinging the Heaven‑Shaking Pillar on its back as it trailed Shen Tu and the others. It had followed Yang Kai's orders to escort them.

The many experts of Purple Star stood idle — or rather, they dared not act rashly — and could only watch those Origin Returning Realm cultivators swagger away under their noses.

Shame colored every face as they looked at Yang Kai, their gazes practically spitting fire.

"The kid is thorough in his methods," Kuang Shizong said suddenly.

"You flatter me, Senior. One must always be cautious," Yang Kai chuckled.

"That thing which left just now — and that thing below — what are they? I've never seen anything like them. Puppets? Living beings?" Kuang Shizong narrowed his eyes.

"Living beings — a very rare species. You won't find them even if you looked for them." Yang Kai answered.

To Kuang Shizong's surprise, Yang Kai did not hide it, but said plainly, "I acquired those two by chance."

Kuang Shizong nodded slightly and, with evident interest, stared at the nearly twenty‑strong army of Blood Beasts. "And these? You don't mean to tell me these are also living beings?"

"They were formed by secret arts. Want to learn? I can teach you." Yang Kai's brow twitched and he wore a sly, impish grin.

"Spare me!" Kuang Shizong snorted. "I doubt I could afford the price!"

He knew Yang Kai was merely passing the time talking to him and would try to glean some information; as for teaching that secret art, Yang Kai would surely demand a harsh price — Kuang Shizong wasn't foolish enough to believe him.

"Very well, then," Yang Kai said without concern, idly bantering with Kuang Shizong.

Suddenly Li Maoming stepped forward, looking dejected; he clasped his fists and asked, "Brother Yang, could you return my Kunlan Blue Ice Flame?"

"The Kunlan Blue Ice Flame?" Yang Kai arched an eyebrow and glanced at the Fire Bird; he immediately realized Li Maoming must mean the blue flame the Fire Bird had swallowed.

"Yes. That Kunlan Blue Ice Flame is valuable to me; if I lost it..." Li Maoming's face flushed with embarrassment.

"Heh, Brother Li, that's not for me to decide — you must ask her yourself." Yang Kai pointed at the Fire Bird.

"You're jesting, Brother Yang." Li Maoming's mouth twitched. "Though I can't tell what sort of existence it is, it obviously regards you as its master. Whether it returns the Kunlan Blue Ice Flame or not is down to you... hmm, I can offer a Void King‑grade Secret Treasure in exchange — how about that?"

The offer was reasonable. Yang Kai thought for a moment and said, "I'll ask for you."

"Thank you, Brother Yang."

Yang Kai then turned to the Fire Bird and asked aloud, "You heard what he said. Will you return the blue flame? Nod if you will, shake your head if you won't."

The Fire Bird glanced at Yang Kai, then looked away with a petulant air.

Yang Kai smiled awkwardly. "Brother Li, you see for yourself; this creature has a bad temper. It likely refuses to return it."

Li Maoming was left speechless.

At that moment, a warship suddenly activated high in the sky. In short order it launched with great speed, breaking through the clouds and heading into the distant Starry Sky.

Seeing this, Yang Kai clasped his fists and said, "Everyone, I bid you farewell. We shall meet again someday."

Saying that, he recalled the Blood Beast army, the Fire Bird, and his Incarnation, shrinking his form into a streak of light that chased after the warship and departed at high speed.

"Brother Yang, my Kunlan Blue Ice Flame — let's be reasonable!" Li Maoming wailed, standing in place and crying out, receiving no reply.

“Patriarch, we’re just letting him walk away like that?” Gongsun Liang stood beside Kuang Shizong, looking thoroughly displeased.

Today's battle was not only Purple Star's humiliation, but also a personal shame for Gongsun Liang; he had suffered heavy losses and would not let it drop.

Kuang Shizong said nothing at first; his eyes glittered as if debating whether to seize the chance to give chase and slaughter them.

"Bad news! Bad news!" A panicked alarm sounded, and everyone turned toward the sound to find Ji Jun, who had long assisted Zi Wuji, rushing over.

"Elder Ji, what happened?" Zi Wuji forced himself through discomfort to ask.

"Second Young Master, that Venerable Yang has looted the entire Purple Star Treasure Vault!" Ji Jun shouted.

"What?" Zi Wuji and Kuang Shizong both changed color, and the others were filled with righteous fury.

"How did that Yang enter the Purple Star Treasure Vault? Where did he get the key? Who led him in?"

"I see. No wonder, Second Young Master. That's why you had the vault's guards pulled away today?" Gongsun Liang glowered at Zi Wuji. "You made a deal with him long ago?"

"I..." Zi Wuji's face flushed as blood rushed to his head; he had no words. "He said he'd only take one item. How could I have known he would be so greedy? I even had Elder Ji follow to watch."

Ji Jun looked ashamed. "I was incapacitated by his sealing and was knocked unconscious until just now..."

"Wretch!" Kuang Shizong roared with fury, a surge of power bursting forth as he struck Zi Wuji and sent him flying — his life unknown. "Everyone, pursue him without regard for cost! Kill that brat in the Starry Sky!"

"Yes!" the crowd answered, launching themselves with body technique toward a direction.

In no time at all, over ten Upper‑Level Origin‑Grade warships in the sky above Purple Star City activated; leading the charge was a Void King‑grade warship at the front, surging into the Starry Sky with murderous momentum.

Others might not know exactly what treasures the Purple Star Treasure Vault held, but how could Kuang Shizong be ignorant?

Other items aside, just the True Dragon Scale was priceless — an artifact that had existed since Purple Star's founding. Over the years countless geniuses of Purple Star had tried to refine that scale for their own use; Kuang Shizong had tried as well, but no one had succeeded.

In the end it was placed on a pedestal and sealed within the Treasure Vault.

Although no one could refine that dragon scale, it did not mean it had no value; on the contrary, its worth was incalculable.

Now that Yang Kai had stolen the True Dragon Scale, of course Kuang Shizong would not let it go — this had become a conflict of mortal enmity between them.

The tremor across Purple Star City was felt by everyone; the aftershocks of battles among Void King‑realm experts left lesser fighters trembling. At the sight of so many warships launching, even a fool would know Purple Star was in for something momentous.

Yet no one knew what exactly had caused today's commotion.

In the Starry Sky, Yang Kai soon caught up to the Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship. Sending a Divine Sense message, the ship's hatch opened and Yang Kai rushed aboard, where he saw Shen Tu and the others waiting for him.

"Brother Yang!" Shen Tu clasped his fists, expression grave. "The life‑saving favor you granted will never be forgotten by Shen Tu. If one day you need anything, just say the word."

Yang Kai chuckled. "Brother Shen Tu, you overstate it — we're family, no need for such formality."

"Family?" A flicker of puzzlement crossed Shen Tu's face, but he did not ponder further; he simply assumed Yang Kai was being polite.

That Yang Kai could speak like that delighted Shen Tu greatly — it showed Yang Kai had not grown arrogant with increased strength.
