## Chapter 1945 — Feigning Compliance

Yang Kai's expression remained unchanged; after a moment's thought he guessed and asked, "Did you reach that conclusion from the things in our Spatial Rings?"

The beautiful woman nodded slightly. "Correct. Only warriors who came from the lower Star Domain would bring so much junk!"

Having her treasures called junk by someone else made Liu Qianyun very displeased, but when she thought of the other's strength, status, and methods, she could only keep silent; perhaps the treasures she prized were indeed worthless in that person's eyes.

Yang Kai paid it no mind at all, for his Spatial Ring had always been filled with trash to conceal his true possessions; even the things that were somewhat decent were of little value, so calling them junk was not unfair. He gave a faint smile and asked, "Then does that clear our suspicion?"

The suspicion he referred to was, of course, the accusation that they were spies for Cuiri Pavilion.

The woman smiled faintly. "Perhaps. But I'm curious — which Star Domain do you come from?"

"Great Wilderness Star Domain!" Yang Kai replied without thinking.

Liu Qianyun sensibly kept silent.

"Oh." The woman appeared thoughtful. "I've heard of that Star Domain; there seems to be a Sect in the Star Realm that has ties to it."

"Do you mean Huangquan Sect? We are not from Huangquan Sect." Yang Kai knew she was probing him and answered smoothly, then coldly smiled and added, "On the contrary, we have some grievances with people from Huangquan Sect."

The woman looked at Yang Kai with a half-smile; her beautiful eyes emitted a strange light as if she wished to pierce into his soul and see truth from falsehood.

"Indeed, in the Starlight Passage we were ambushed by people from Huangquan Sect," Yang Kai snorted. His gaze turned venomous, as though he bore an implacable hatred toward them.

The woman nodded and said no more.

After a moment's thought she said, "Since you are not spies for Cuiri Pavilion, and you do come from a lower Star Domain, I can give you two choices."

"Do tell!" they both said.

"First, leave my Biyu Sect now and go as far away as you can!" The woman raised a pale white finger and smiled lightly.

Hearing that, Liu Qianyun's expression moved and she nearly blurted out her agreement, but before she could speak she glanced at Yang Kai and saw his indifferent face, so she swallowed the words.

"And the second?" Yang Kai asked.

"Second, join my Biyu Sect and become disciples of Biyu Sect. Though our sect is not a great power in the Southern Domain, it still has a foothold; joining here gives you a place to land and people to shelter you. If you encounter difficulties in cultivation, I can give you guidance."

Yang Kai's eyes brightened at the offer; he seemed greatly tempted.

The woman smiled but said nothing, pleased with Yang Kai's attitude.

Yang Kai thought for a moment, then said, "I have another question."

"Speak!" The woman lifted her chin, arrogant and cool.

"Our strength isn't very high. Why do you want to take us into the Sect?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

The woman covered her mouth and laughed, "Because you come from a lower Star Domain — warriors like you are worth cultivating. Unfortunately, you are not of Star Lord blood; had you been a Star Lord, you would receive more care."

"I see." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Liu Qianyun had mentioned this before: warriors who came from lower Star Domains were often the top geniuses of their regions, so upon entering the Star Realm they were welcomed by the great Sects and favored by many powerful figures, even if they were not Star Lords.

The woman's explanation sounded reasonable.

"So which will you choose?" she asked Yang Kai.

"What is there to hesitate about? I'll join Biyu Sect," Yang Kai answered without thinking, then turned and asked, "Qianyun, what do you think?"

Liu Qianyun was bewildered; she had not expected Yang Kai to decide so rashly and felt flustered when asked.

Yet when their eyes met, Liu Qianyun nodded, "Then I'll follow Brother Yang's decision — I'll join too!"

The woman smiled and stood from her chair. "From now on you will be disciples of Biyu Sect and temporarily fall under my charge. Kou Wu, take them down and arrange lodging; let them cultivate properly — do not disappoint me."

After speaking she turned and left.

Kou Wu respectfully promised behind her.

Once the woman had gone, Kou Wu smiled at Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun and said, "From now on we're fellow disciples. Senior Brother hasn't asked your names yet."

Yang Kai grinned, clasped his fists in greeting, and made himself at ease.

Liu Qianyun felt awkward but gave her name in return.

Upon learning their names, Kou Wu adopted a martial air and said, "So you are Junior Brother Yang and Junior Sister Liu. Senior Brother has caused you trouble recently—please do not hold it against me; I was merely bound by duty."

"Senior Brother Kou, you flatter us; the earlier matter was our fault, not yours," Liu Qianyun said.

Kou Wu nodded and beckoned, "Follow me; I'll take you to your lodgings to settle in and acquaint yourselves with the surroundings. Biyu Sect is not bad."

They went down and, when they reached the foot of the peak, Kou Wu pointed to two adjacent wooden houses and said, "This will be your lodging. Each room is set with restrictions that require an identity tag to activate. The tags will be delivered in a couple of days. Stay here for two days and don't wander; wait until the tags arrive before going out, otherwise you may encounter unnecessary trouble."

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded. "Senior Brother Kou, what do we need to do day to day?"

Kou Wu smiled, "For now there is nothing required of you — cultivate diligently. If a mission comes, I will summon you. Also, we all fall under Protector Bian's jurisdiction; other peaks are not our concern, just obey Protector Bian's orders. That's all for today; we'll speak another time."

With that Kou Wu left.

Yang Kai suddenly remembered something and called out, "Senior Brother Kou!"

"What is it?" Kou Wu frowned slightly, showing some impatience.

Yang Kai leaned in and asked softly, "Senior Brother Kou, Protector Bian's cultivation..."

Kou Wu smiled lightly, "She is at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm — that is not something you can hope for right now. Cultivation must be taken step by step."

"Understood, Senior Brother!" Yang Kai put on an obedient air.

After Kou Wu left, only Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun remained. Yang Kai's expression suddenly turned cold; he signaled Liu Qianyun and they went into one of the wooden houses.

Liu Qianyun followed close behind.

The room was simply furnished with a bed, a mat, a table, and a chair. Although it looked as if no one had lived there for a long time, not a speck of dust lay about — clearly the formations were in effect.

Once seated, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings; after confirming there was no eavesdropping, he asked, "You wanted to ask why I chose to join Biyu Sect, right?"

Liu Qianyun thought for a moment and said, "I did have that question, but on reflection this is probably our only way to survive."

"Indeed. Protector Bian gave us two choices, but who knows the consequences of taking the other path? You saw how Biyu Sect's people act — they are not gentle souls." Yang Kai sighed.

Liu Qianyun smiled bitterly, "I didn't expect the Star Realm to be like this; if only we'd known earlier..."

"There's no point dwelling on regrets now. We'll cross each bridge as we come to it — once our strength is enough, who could possibly keep us trapped here?" Yang Kai sneered.

"True..." Liu Qianyun forced a smile. "Then I'll rest first."

"Mm."

The next few days passed without incident.

Since their identity tags had not yet been issued, Yang Kai did not dare wander and remained in the room cultivating in seclusion.

Without the restrictions, the Saint Yuan converted into Origin Qi at a greatly increased speed.

Yang Kai could vaguely sense that he was about to touch the gate of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Before entering the Star Domain he had spent several years in the Death Domain outside Dark Star, contemplating the endless Imperial Might that flowed there and benefitting enormously; later he had also accumulated experience in the Starlight Passage, so he was fully confident in breaking through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Yet he was not in a hurry.

After all, he was newly arrived and had only just joined Biyu Sect; if he were too conspicuous he might attract unnecessary trouble.

So when his accumulation reached its peak, Yang Kai deliberately slowed his progress, letting his body absorb starlight and convert Saint Yuan into Origin Qi so that the next breakthrough would be easier.

A few days later, Kou Wu brought their identity tags. With the tags they truly became disciples of Biyu Sect and, except for some forbidden areas, could move about freely.

Yang Kai took the opportunity to look around and met many disciples of Biyu Sect. Regardless of their temperaments, those he befriended were Void King Realm cultivators and thus knew much about the Star Realm's affairs.

Through inquiries, Yang Kai learned a useful piece of intelligence.

That was, within Biyu Sect there were no Emperor Realm existences!

Only five Dao Origin Third Stage experts were stationed there, and Protector Bian was one of them.

This matched his earlier estimate. Upon learning that Bian Yuqing was a Dao Origin Third Stage expert, Yang Kai guessed that even if Biyu Sect had Emperors, there would be very few and they would not be high in realm.

After all, a Protector's cultivation directly reflected the sect's highest combat standard.

Besides Bian Yuqing, there were four other Dao Origin Third Stage experts — one was the Sect Master and the other three were Protectors in charge of the other main peaks; the four Protectors each performed their duties and did not interfere with one another.
