## Chapter 374 — Do You Not Believe?

The battle for supremacy within the Yang Family was about to commence, and the young masters would surely scramble to curry favor, gathering allies to help them achieve victory in this contention for leadership.

Qiu Yimeng had brought Yang Kai to the Lü Family this time. Though she hadn’t said much, Lü Liang knew the hidden meaning behind her subtle gestures; what lay before them might just be an opportunity.

Twenty years ago, the Lü Family had been in decline, precariously making a living in their small piece of land, naturally having no thoughts of participating in the struggle for power.

But now, the Lü Family had grown, standing tall as a first-rate noble clan!

People always sought higher ground, just as water flowed to lower places! Would the Lü Family not desire to ascend to greater heights?

Having already latched onto the Qiu Family, if they could also build a good relationship with the Yang Family, the future of the Lü Family would surely be bright.

However… clinging to the Yang Family's thigh was not so simple.

The Yang Family was a prestigious clan with a stable lineage, while the capable leaders were ever-changing!

Every transition of the family head would bring about significant disturbances in the situation. Lü Liang wished to engage in this power struggle, but he was unsure whether Yang Kai possessed the qualifications or strength to vie for dominance.

If Lü Family’s fortunes were tied to Yang Kai and he were to fail miserably in the contest, it could mean that decades of hard work would go down the drain.

Lü Liang had to be cautious; the upper echelons of the Lü Family also needed to keep their eyes peeled.

The consequences of picking the wrong side were no joke! It concerned the future of an entire lineage.

The conversation, guided by the crowd's subtle hints, gradually shifted towards the struggle for power, as they recalled the major incident from twenty years ago while secretly observing Yang Kai's reactions.

To their disappointment, Yang Kai appeared unfazed by it all. His expression remained calm as he savored the delicacies while quietly listening, not showing much interest nor any sign of impatience.

The people of the Lü Family were left uncertain about what he truly thought.

Slowly, the conversation turned to the current situation.

Currently, the young masters of the Yang Family had yet to reveal themselves; no one in the world knew what sort of foundation those returning heirs had.

Yet, there was a genuine young master from the Yang Family right in front of them, and Lü Liang was eager to probe Yang Kai's connections and confidence.

As the topic heated up, just as Lü Liang was about to feign a casual inquiry, he noticed that Yang Kai was yawning and stretching.

Lü Liang couldn't help but pause, swallowing back the words he’d almost spoken.

"Are you tired, Young Master?" Tang Yuxian softly asked.

Yang Kai casually replied, "Not really."

Lü Liang's eyes flickered, and he chuckled, "Since Young Master Yang is weary from travel, let us end today’s meeting here. Someone, take Young Master Yang to rest!"

Yang Kai politely rose, cupping his fists in salute to the crowd, saying, "In that case, I will take my leave."

"Young Master Yang is too polite!" Lü Liang chuckled lightly.

As the gathering dispersed after the departure of Yang Kai along with his two Blood Servants, the Lü Family members wore strange expressions as they contemplated.

They had expected Yang Kai to come to the Lü Family to recruit allies, and they had prepared accordingly. Otherwise, they wouldn't have observed him so closely at the table. Lü Liang even thought about how he should refuse if Yang Kai dove directly into the topic, ensuring they wouldn’t hurt feelings in the process.

After all, he knew nothing about Yang Kai, so it was impossible to rashly agree to support him.

But he had not expected that this young master would say nothing at all and simply leave like that.

This greatly exceeded everyone’s expectations.

"Family Head!" a senior member of the Lü Family furrowed his brow, speaking with an odd expression, "Could it be he merely passed by?"

"It shouldn't be," Lü Liang pondered for a moment, slowly shaking his head. "He must have intentions to recruit us. Though he appeared indifferent, I can feel it."

"Then why didn't he show it?" someone scoffed. "Does he lack confidence?"

Many nodded in agreement, thinking that if he had confidence, how could he say nothing? At the very least, he should showcase his strength and foundation.

"If that's the case, the Lü Family shouldn't harbor any hopes of him. We’d do well to avoid being left empty-handed after putting in the effort.”

The consensus among the crowd reduced their expectations of Yang Kai significantly.

Lü Liang furrowed his brow, his slender eyes shining brightly as he smiled faintly, "I can’t shake the feeling that he’s not lacking in confidence, but rather wanting to assess the Lü Family’s worth."

"Ah?" The others’ expressions changed, "He wants to assess us? Does he have the qualifications for that?"

Even if he was a young master of the Yang Family able to participate in the power struggle, he was just a young master. What right did he have to judge the Lü Family?

Lü Liang chuckled lightly, "Have you forgotten? The struggle for power is not only us selecting the young masters of the Yang Family, but also them selecting us. Do you really believe that we, as a first-rate noble clan, are as glorious as it seems? Should those young masters be the ones vying for our attention and begging for our assistance?"

The crowd fell silent for a moment before chuckling.

Someone said, "Family Head, your words sound a bit harsh, but we don’t mean it that way, do we?"

"Yes, yes, yes. We just think that if what you say holds true, this young man might just be too arrogant and high-handed!" 

No matter how eminent the Lü Family was, it could at least provide some support. Whether in manpower or resources, they were not weak; it was already fortunate for someone like him to receive assistance, yet he wanted to assess?

Lü Liang’s expression turned serious as he stated solemnly, "If my guess is correct, this Young Master Yang... is not simple."

The others contemplated this and started to feel moved.

Even a first-rate noble clan like theirs had to think carefully before trying to become his ally; it indicated that he had extensive connections. In his eyes, the Lü Family’s support might be inconsequential; hence, he remained so indifferent and not the least bit eager.

If he had rushed in wanting to recruit the Lü Family, that would be a sign of insecurity.

Upon realizing this, Lü Liang felt increasingly that his speculation was correct.

He quietly said, "I do not know how long this young master plans to stay at the Lü Family, but in any case, do not mention the struggle for power when you see him again, nor should you show anything.”

After a moment of contemplation, he nodded, "I will go find Miss Qiu to investigate the situation."

She brought him here, so she must understand some details about this young master, right?

Everyone nodded in agreement. Although Lü Liang might not be the most powerful among them, his reputation was undoubtedly the highest. Over these years, it was under his leadership that the Lü Family had begun to flourish, and his ability to assess people has been apparent.

…

In the back courtyard of the Lü Family, within a spacious yard.

Yang Kai stood with his hands clasped behind his back, gazing pensively in one direction.

While lost in thought, Tang Yuxian spoke up: “Little Master, why did you act so disengaged just now? Your demeanor might lead them to misunderstand. Don’t you want to recruit the Lü Family to aid you?”

Yang Kai smiled lightly, “If I said I don't want to, would you believe it?”

Tang Yuxian chuckled, shaking her head slowly.

If he truly had no interest, he wouldn’t have come here with Qiu Yimeng. Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman came here to borrow two Treading Cloud Steeds, and Yang Kai could have simply returned to Zhongdu directly.

Since he came, he surely had some intentions.

“Actually, I really don’t want to,” Yang Kai smiled lightly, shaking his head. “Believe it or not!”

Tang Yuxian was stunned, eyeing Yang Kai with suspicion, as if trying to see into his heart, but his expression was calm with no trace of deceit.

Tu Feng’s expression also shifted slightly, looking at Yang Kai in surprise.

In the current situation, the more allies one gathered, the greater the future assistance would be. There was a golden opportunity right now; as long as Yang Kai could display methods and strength that would win over the Lü Family’s genuine admiration, the Lü Family would surely gravitate towards him.

Yet he had no thoughts at all?

"I have no connection with the Lü Family. If they help me, it would only be out of self-interest; I do not prefer such relationships!” Yang Kai said softly. "Even if we were temporarily tied together, when danger arises, they would inevitably stab me in the back. What I want are allies who will steadfastly support me, regardless of pressure or harsh environments!"

Both Blood Servants gazed at Yang Kai in stunned silence, as if suddenly realizing this young master might be a bit naive.

People in the world hustled and bustled, coming and going for profit. Without interests binding them, who would willingly share joys and sorrows with you?

"You don’t believe there will be such people?" Yang Kai smiled at the two.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian both coughed lightly, unsure how to respond.

"There will be! Just wait and see." 

Tang Yuxian paused, uncertain where Yang Kai’s confidence stemmed from, but his attitude did stir something within her, and she smiled, "Then let’s wait and see."

Tu Feng also smiled, “But Young Master, your actions today were not misguided. If you had shown any intention of recruiting, the Lü Family would merely have engaged in hollow pleasantries and wouldn’t show their true stance. Rather than that, it’s best not to say anything at all.”

“Indeed.” Yang Kai nodded, “The Lü Family wants to know my background; I can tell that easily. No matter how flowery their words are, they are only probing. Until the situation clarifies, they cannot make a genuine decision.”

The situation was naturally unclear now; no one knew who the Yang Family’s young masters were or how many there were.

But when seeking to befriend someone, it was vital to curry favor while they were still weak and seize every opportunity, for the effect diverged greatly when waiting to ally after they’d grown strong.

Adding flowers to the brocade is never as comforting as sending charcoal in the snow.

"Enough of that! I’m not interested in the Lü Family, but they do possess something that intrigues me quite a bit, hehe!" Yang Kai chuckled.

“What is that?” Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian asked curiously.

“I don’t know,” Yang Kai replied before turning and walking into the house.

The two Blood Servants couldn’t help but be dumbfounded.

Is there such a thing in this world, being interested in something but not knowing what that something is? How could you be interested if you didn’t know what it was?

Watching Yang Kai step into the room to rest, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian exchanged bitter smiles, feeling increasingly unable to see through this young master.
