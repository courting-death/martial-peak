## Chapter 1222 — Hostility

Everyone knew Li Younan was talking nonsense; if he truly believed he could persuade every Sect not to seize the Red Candle Fruit and simply hand such an existence over to the Medicine Pill Sect, that would be the strange thing.

Only what one holds in one’s own hands truly belongs to oneself. Li Younan’s words carried no sincerity at all and were not to be trusted.

Besides, such a monumental matter was not his to decide. If Li Younan took the Red Candle Fruit back and the elders of the Medicine Pill Sect refused to acknowledge the junior’s decision, what could the other Sects do? Even if they joined forces to annihilate the Medicine Pill Sect, the Red Candle Fruit would still slip through their fingers.

Wei Guchang understood the hidden tricks better than anyone. He knew that once he loosened his stance and agreed, he would instantly become the target of blame. Qu Changfeng, Fang Tianzhong, Yin Sudie, as well as Qu Minghai from Shuangxin Valley and Tang Yongyi of Piaomiao Hall, would never rashly consent to such an unreasonable proposal.

Yet he was no fool who would offend the Medicine Pill Sect to their face. He pretended to ponder for a moment, then nodded slightly: “If Brother Qu and Brother Fang agree, then Yingyue Hall can take a share, that would be acceptable. But Brother Li… hehe, have you already notified that fellow?”

Saying this, he subtly gestured toward one of the nearby hillocks.

Li Younan’s face twitched; he naturally knew exactly whom Wei Guchang meant. He forced a smile and said, “I intend to consult with everyone first, then discuss the matter with him in detail.”

Wei Guchang sneered and shook his head, sighing: “This won’t be easy. If it were just our families, joining hands would be fine, but now with this extra variable, I think Brother Li should first settle that man’s stance before explaining things to us.”

Li Younan was taken aback for a moment but kept his composure and cupped his hands: “Brother Wei has a point. I shall return and ponder it. We will discuss this matter at length later.”

With that he drifted down from the hillock and went back to his side.

After he left, Wei Guchang emitted an imperceptible cold snort: “Does he really take me for an idiot?”

Daiyuan chuckled softly beside him: “Brother Wei, you know the sort of people the Medicine Pill Sect are; why haggle with them? It’s right not to agree this time. If we had agreed, that would have been trouble.”

“I know that,” Wei Guchang said gravely. “Putting that aside, whether this is a boon or a calamity is uncertain. That such a spiritual fruit has ripened and appeared now — it’s hard to tell if it’s fate or disaster.”

He looked at the elites seated on the various hills and silently wondered how many of them would die in strife when the Red Candle Fruit truly matured.

“Putting those concerns aside, I feel it would be beneficial to cultivate here for a while. There’s still some time before the Three Suns Rising phenomenon Daiyuan Sister mentioned. Why don’t we stay and attune ourselves here?” Xuan’er suggested.

The other three nodded in agreement, each finding a spot on a hillock to sit cross‑legged and savor the various subtleties contained within the fruit’s aroma.

Yang Kai quickly sensed the extraordinary nature of the Red Candle Fruit. Just as the ancient texts described, in the few days before its ripening it continuously released a fragrant aroma. When inhaled, that fragrance seeped into the flesh and bones, helping cultivators refine their control over their own strength and harmonize their cultivation realm.

Even with only a single red sun rising, such effects were astonishing; if all three suns converged, the results would surely multiply manyfold.

Since he was here with Wei Guchang and the others, Yang Kai felt little risk of being ambushed, so he only left a sliver of spirit to watch the surroundings and quickly sank into that exquisite sensation.

As an alchemist, Yang Kai had always required an exceptionally high degree of control over his Saint Yuan when refining pills, so in this regard, he was far more skilled than most cultivators. Now, under the subtle stimulation of the Red Candle Fruit’s fragrance, his mastery over Saint Yuan grew even more refined, drawing him wholly into the experience. Before long, Yang Kai found himself utterly immersed—as though he had stepped into a new world where he could commune perfectly with the power within his body and wield it with absolute precision.

Yang Kai plunged into insights on controlling Saint Yuan, while Wei Guchang, Xuan’er and Daiyuan each sank into deep realizations across different domains and forces.

The martial artists on the other hillocks, after an initial period of observation, sensibly sat cross‑legged and inhaled the Red Candle Fruit’s fragrance, ceasing to waste time.

About half a day after Yang Kai arrived, a bizarre calm settled over the place; everyone was absorbed in discerning the benefits the Red Candle Fruit’s aroma brought them.

More people kept arriving at the hillocks. Though most seemed bewildered, seeing those who’d come earlier sitting in meditation, they mimicked them and quickly, with looks of wonder, fell helplessly into immersion.

At one moment, a young warrior in cyan robes arrived alone. He was the very man who earlier had attempted to venture deeper into the Third Layer, but he was a little late: the hillocks near the valley had already been occupied. He swept his cold gaze around, briefly considering seizing a spot, but soon discarded the thought.

He had only recently obtained a new body through takeover and had just seen daylight again; he did not wish to attract attention for now.

Yet when his eyes passed over Yang Kai, who sat cross‑legged, they narrowed and a look of delighted surprise flickered across his face — he had not expected to meet Yang Kai in such a place.

But his brow soon knitted, his expression darkening until it seemed about to drip with malice.

He was certain it was this First Stage of the Saint King Realm practitioner who had taken his extremely precious item. Yet he could still sense no trace of it from Yang Kai.

Could the other have truly fused it? That seemed impossible; he knew better than anyone the tremendous power contained within that thing. Not even a First Stage of the Saint King Realm could fuse it easily; a Void King Realm cultivator attempting fusion would not finish the task in a day or two and might be severely harmed by backlash.

The peculiarity lay in that the First Stage Saint King youth had left the Stalactite Cave with his prize, and within less than an hour the item’s aura had vanished without a trace. No matter how he employed secret methods to track it, no clues could be discerned.

Besides, if he had tried to fuse it himself, he would not still be alive now; he would have perished already.

This baffling turn of events left him furious and mortified. He could not imagine that the one who fused with that thing was not Yang Kai himself but rather a heaven‑and‑earth treasure — the Warm Spirit Lotus — which had already grown to six‑color maturity.

While he brooded and could not fathom the matter, the First Stage Saint King youth on the opposite hillock suddenly opened his eyes and, from a great distance, fixed his gaze on him with deadly accuracy. The man felt a chill and hurriedly averted his gaze, pretending nonchalance, then picked a less desirable spot and sat to meditate like the others.

On that hillock Yang Kai’s brow was tightly drawn, his face full of displeasure.

He had been immersed in deep insight when he suddenly realized someone was spying on him — and that the gaze carried hostility and killing intent. He first wondered whether it was Qu Changfeng, but when he saw the man’s face clearly he was stunned.

The man was not Qu Changfeng, but Yang Kai had seen him before — he was one of those who had entered the pool to bathe in the Soul Cleansing Divine Water within the Stalactite Cave.

Being interrupted from his contemplation put Yang Kai out of sorts.

That man’s strength was considerable—at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. Yang Kai vaguely recalled that he belonged to a force known as Liu Yun Valley.

At the time there had also been an elder and another man with him; now only this one remained. Yang Kai wondered what catastrophe had befallen them, and whether the elder and the other man of Liu Yun Valley lived or died.

Why would this person harbor hatred and murderous intent for him? Yang Kai was certain he had never provoked the man or revealed many secrets before him, yet to be marked out and remembered by him out of the blue made Yang Kai secretly peeved.

“Junior Brother Yang, did you perceive anything?” Daiyuan, sensing the change in Yang Kai’s breath, opened her eyes and saw his thoughtful expression, quickly whispering.

“No.” Yang Kai shook his head, then, looking in a certain direction, asked, “Do you recognize that man?”

Daiyuan followed his gaze and promptly revealed the man’s identity: “That is Lu Ye, a Core Disciple of Liu Yun Valley. Why, do you have a grudge with him, Brother Yang?”

Lu Ye! Yang Kai stored the name away and shook his head. “No, we only met once. I don’t know why Lu Ye bears me hostility; it’s truly strange.”

Daiyuan’s pretty eyes flickered; puzzled, she said, “Lu Ye isn’t the sort to pick fights. I don’t know him well, but I’ve spoken with him a few times. His reputation in Liu Yun Valley is quite good. Why would he be hostile toward you?”

“I’d like to know that too,” Yang Kai grinned.

Daiyuan, perhaps thinking he and Lu Ye had a real grudge, furrowed her brow and softly reminded him, “Lu Ye is the son of Lu Xiangdong, the valley lord of Liu Yun Valley. Liu Yun Valley isn’t a top power but is respectable. If it’s not a major matter, I can speak a few words to Lu Ye and mediate; with his temperament, it should be no problem.”

“No need.” Yang Kai shook his head. Even if there were enmity between him and Lu Ye, he didn’t require others to resolve it. If Lu Ye did not come looking for trouble, fine; if he did, Yang Kai wouldn’t mind cutting the weed at the root.

Seeing Yang Kai refuse her offer, Daiyuan fell silent. Just as she was about to resume her meditation, Yang Kai signaled with his eyes toward the side and asked, “What about that man?”

Daiyuan followed his gaze and, seeing a lone, aloof man occupying a small hillock, could not help but change expression slightly. She quickly withdrew her eyes and warned softly, “Junior Brother Yang, do not pry into that man. I only know he should be from the Star Emperor Sect, but I do not know his name.”
