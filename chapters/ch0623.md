## Chapter 623 — There Might Be a Surprise

After seeing Shui Ling off, Yun Xuan allowed herself a faint smile. "Alright, I'll take you to the Secret Treasure Hall to retrieve that Bone Shield. Master Ma should have finished repairing and refining it."

Yang Kai's spirit stirred; he could not help feeling a quiet anticipation.

Of the Secret Treasures he possessed, aside from the Spirit-Soul Short Sword lodged in his Sea of Consciousness, only the Bone Shield remained.

Moreover, on the Tongxuan Continent, where powerful figures rose like tides and danger lurked everywhere, Yang Kai felt the Bone Shield would be far more useful, so he had not refused Yun Xuan's offering of the Kongchan Jade and had spent his Ice-Flame Star Sand to have Master Ma repair it.

With the Bone Shield, an extra layer of protection would be added to his life.

Ten days had passed now; it was naturally time to go and collect the Bone Shield.

When the bearded man and the others heard this, they all declared they wanted to follow and take a look, to see what grade of Secret Treasure Yang Kai used. Yun Xuan could only smile helplessly and allow them to trail behind.

It was the same Secret Treasure Hall as before; Yun Xuan led Yang Kai in with practiced steps and they entered an inner chamber, where Master Ma awaited them.

Seeing Yang Kai, he said little and simply handed the Bone Shield over.

The Bone Shield's brilliance was restrained, giving no obvious sign of peculiarity, but the moment Yang Kai took it in hand he felt that this shield was somewhat different from before.

The pitted damage on its surface had been fully repaired, the several broken bone spines at the edge had been reattached, and the shield felt bone-chillingly cold to the touch — clearly still bearing the properties of Ice-Flame Star Sand.

The Bone Shield's grade had risen considerably from before.

Yang Kai's expression brightened.

"Mystery-Grade, Upper-Level. It's a pity it wasn't refined up to Spirit-Grade, but it will do. With it, cultivators below the Transcendent Realm cannot break through your defenses. Even facing Transcendent Realm opponents, you will have means to resist," Master Ma said matter-of-factly.

"Thank you for your trouble, Master," Yang Kai bowed deeply.

"No need — it's just a business transaction. This is what I do. This time I'm being lenient because of Miss Yun; if you come to me next time to repair a Secret Treasure, I won't be so merciful." Master Ma replied.

Yang Kai inclined his head lightly. Yun Xuan smiled and said, "Then we will take our leave."

Master Ma made a small affirmative sound, then suddenly added, "Miss Yun, be careful in everything. Don't push yourself too hard."

"I understand. Thank you for your concern, Master," she answered.

Leaving the Secret Treasure Hall and stepping outside, the bearded man and the rest immediately clamored to inspect Yang Kai's Secret Treasure. Yang Kai did not refuse; he produced the Bone Shield and let them examine it, and the big men stared with envy.

Their own Secret Treasures, while some were Mystery-Grade, were mostly of Lower-Level, so there was still a gap between them and the Bone Shield's Mystery-Grade Upper-Level.

Moreover, the Bone Shield was clearly a chief defensive Secret Treasure; possessing such an item meant one's life was more secure. For the bearded man and the others, it was the sort of priceless prize they longed for in their dreams.

"We cannot continue to accompany you," Yun Xuan said with some apology as she looked at him. "The alliance has assigned us a task; we must leave at once. If you don't mind, you may continue staying at our residence for a while, but we do not know when we will return."

Yang Kai frowned and, after a moment's thought, said, "I will go with you."

"Going with us?" Yun Xuan's expression grew odd, then she pursed her lips and smiled. "Do you wish to join our Duao Alliance?"

Yang Kai shook his head. "I owe you a Kongchan Jade. I'll go out with you to see if I can stumble upon any opportunities. Rest assured, I won't take any share of your mission reward."

Yun Xuan's dark brows knit slightly; she felt somewhat uneasy. After all, she and Yang Kai were not well acquainted. She had treated him kindly these days only for Shui Ling's sake.

Now that Shui Ling had left, she no longer had to maintain any particular dealings with Yang Kai.

That Kongchan Jade could be treated as the price she paid to curry favor with the Water Divine Hall; she could bear such a cost.

Yang Kai's sudden wish to go with them left Yun Xuan in some doubt.

He was a Seventh Stage cultivator of the Divine Roaming Realm, which was no mean level, but he was still young and his true combat prowess was unknown. If he lost his composure in a dangerous moment, he might very well bring trouble to the squad and cause unnecessary losses.

As the squad leader, Yun Xuan had to weigh many considerations.

"Taking me along might yield some surprises," Yang Kai said calmly, looking at her. "I will obey your orders and follow your command."

"Surprises?" Yun Xuan pursed her lips and smiled. After a moment's thought she suddenly nodded solemnly. "Very well. Since you insist on repaying me a favor, I will not refuse. But remember, once we set out on a mission, everything must follow my orders. If because of you any member of my squad suffers mortal danger, I will make you pay."

Yang Kai shrugged, indicating his agreement.

He disliked owing people. Once he found an opportunity to repay Yun Xuan the value of the Kongchan Jade, he could part ways and set out to look for Su Yan and the others.

"Then let's go," Yun Xuan waved her hand.

No special preparations were necessary; the members of Yun Xuan's squad were veterans of many missions and had already prepared everything in advance.

As Yun Xuan's group left Duao City, the bearded man and Yang Kai linked arms and loudly bantered, "Brother, what surprise are you talking about? Why would bringing you mean surprises?"

Yang Kai was well acquainted with his shameless familiarity and made no reply; silence is golden.

All the while, his formidable Divine Sense never ceased probing the surroundings, seeking anything of value.

Unfortunately, he found nothing.

From the idle chatter of Yun Xuan's squad members, Yang Kai gradually learned what their mission entailed.

Seven or eight days' journey from Duao City, in the Qianye Forest, a sudden influx of unknown Demonic Beasts had appeared, and many passing cultivators and disciples of Duao Alliance had met their deaths there.

The Qianye Forest held great value for the Duao Alliance not only because many rare medicinal herbs grew within it, but also because a Ri Xi mineral vein ran through its midsection.

The Ri Xi mineral was not of high grade, but when refined by an artificer it could serve many purposes.

That was the source of the Qianye Forest's value to the Duao Alliance.

Those who had escaped reported the beasts were not of very high rank, mostly Sixth-Tier, but they were numerous.

A group had already been sent to scout; Yun Xuan's squad was to rendezvous with that group and purge the Demonic Beasts.

The beasts' demon cores, body parts, and blood were materials for alchemy and forging — a veritable feast on a silver platter that the Duao Alliance could not lightly let pass.

They rode hard and rested briefly along the way; after seven or eight days a boundless forest came into view before Yang Kai.

At the forest's edge someone waited. Seeing Yun Xuan and the others arrive, his face lit up and he hurried forward, smiling as he greeted, "Yun Xuan, you have come?"

His smile was sincere and tinged with admiration; he watched Yun Xuan intently, his expression excited.

Yun Xuan looked at him in surprise. "Zhou Luo, what are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be on another mission?"

The youth called Zhou Luo laughed and answered without embarrassment, "I heard you would come here, so I volunteered to come help."

Yun Xuan frowned and her expression instantly cooled. "What is the situation here now?"

"Xinyu's squad has been here ten days. Everything has been scouted out; there are no beasts of exceedingly high strength. We're just waiting for you and then we can begin," Zhou Luo replied softly.

"Then lead the way," Yun Xuan nodded.

Zhou Luo smiled and led politely at the front.

"Damn it, we've run into this bastard again," the bearded man muttered irritably to Yang Kai, his eyes flashing as he glared at Zhou Luo's retreating back, grinding his teeth.

"A grudge?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

"No grudge, just dislike," Ji Hong snorted. "This fellow is all honeyed words and a poisonous heart; he's two-faced. Always thinking about women, he's ruined many of the alliance's women. Half a year ago he set his sights on our captain but she never gave him a chance. Don't be fooled by his righteous appearance — he's full of ill intent. He's tried countless ways to take part in missions with our captain."

"Oh," Yang Kai responded lightly, offering no further comment.

The disputes of the Duao Alliance mattered little to him; he naturally did not wish to draw trouble onto himself.

Ji Hong had perhaps spoken a bit too loudly, for Zhou Luo suddenly turned and grinned at him; the bearded man could only snort in disdain.

After traveling about half a day deeper into the forest, Yang Kai sensed the presence of many life auras waiting ahead.

Counting roughly, there were at least a dozen.

The Duao Alliance dispatched squads of around five to eight for missions; Yun Xuan's squad numbered eight.

Zhou Luo had brought a team to assist. The Xinyu he mentioned had scouted ahead and was himself the leader of another squad.

Yang Kai's keen perception detected the aura of a Transcendent Realm expert ahead.

It seemed likely the Duao Alliance, fearing accidents here, had stationed a Transcendent Realm master to oversee matters; with such a figure present, everyone's sense of security was greatly increased.

Zhou Luo raised his hand and called out as they approached the others: "Yun Xuan and the others have arrived."

The Transcendent Realm master before them nodded indifferently; he appeared not to be very old.

Beside him stood a petite woman with a striking figure — full and curvaceous — and the bearded man and the others immediately stared her up and down, eyes shining red as if quite taken with her.

The woman snorted coldly, her manner decidedly hostile, and she also looked at Yun Xuan with open enmity.
