## Chapter 329 — No Need for Your Compensation

A dozen miles behind Yang Kai, Tao Yang and the others were walking cautiously. However, after such a long while, they had not encountered a single evil spirit, leaving them greatly puzzled.

“Why is it so peaceful here?” Rong Mei furrowed her brows and muttered.

Tao Yang had a suspicious expression, his face vaguely showing signs of shock, and said solemnly, “I fear that all the evil spirits along this way have been cleared out by someone.”

“Who would bother to clean out the outer evil spirits?” Rong Mei chuckled lightly, but suddenly seemed to recall something, turning to Tao Yang and asking, “Senior Brother, are you saying...?”

“Indeed. Others wouldn’t trouble themselves to come back, but to walk from the outside in, one must clear them out.” Tao Yang gazed intently ahead, “It seems I underestimated his abilities. Not only is he powerful, but the cultivation method and martial skills he practices seem very effective against these evil spirits. Otherwise, no matter how strong he is, he wouldn’t have acted so swiftly.”

The other three stared in astonishment, no longer daring to underestimate Yang Kai in their hearts.

...

Holding the Purifying Spirit Flask in his hand, Yang Kai faced a mass of evil spirit essence but failed to draw it in after exerting effort for quite some time.

He couldn’t help but feel puzzled.

After observing for a while, he suddenly realized that the Purifying Spirit Flask also had a capacity; it couldn’t absorb an infinite amount of evil spirit essence.

Realizing this, Yang Kai shook his head with a bitter smile, directly extending his hand to absorb the evil spirit essence before him into his palm, circulating it a few times within his meridians.

Under the purifying burn of the True Yang Yuan Qi, the mass of evil spirit essence was quickly cleansed, transforming into a surge of energy that flowed into the Proud Bone Golden Body.

It was simpler than he had imagined.

After absorbing this surge of energy, an unusual sensation suddenly surged within the Proud Bone Golden Body, as if it were desperately craving that energy, seeking satisfaction.

Indeed, the energy here was quite suitable for the Proud Bone Golden Body, and sensing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel joy.

He had felt a similar sense when refining Le Yu’s Purple Evil Energy before. Yang Kai had speculated that this place was a blessed land for the Proud Bone Golden Body, and now it seemed to be true.

Since refining evil spirit essence was quite easy, Yang Kai simply absorbed all twenty masses of essence from the Purifying Spirit Flask into his meridians.

It took less than a quarter of an hour for him to completely refine them.

The Proud Bone Golden Body conveyed an even more joyful and eager feeling, leaving Yang Kai feeling both relaxed and pleased.

The only disappointment was that this energy only increased Yang Kai's strength, and he didn’t gain any further insights, not even an increase in his Divine Sense power.

With a grin, Yang Kai felt satisfied; after all, it was said that the special evil spirit essence within the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave was quite rare, and whether one encountered it depended on luck.

Just as he was about to continue exploring, a sudden movement in his heart made him turn to gaze in a certain direction, his expression turning particularly strange.

Frowning in thought for a moment, Yang Kai hurried toward that direction.

Half an hour later, the sounds of battle reached his ears. Over there, various colors of light and martial skills flickered.

Following the light, Yang Kai saw a group of people gathered together—both men and women, not very old. Led by a young woman, they were engaged in combat with several evil spirits.

The martial skills they deployed were quite sinister. Each person's hands were ghostly white, resembling claws, radiating a chilling aura. Occasionally, someone would unleash a ghost face-like martial skill, fiercely entangling with the evil spirits.

These ghost face martial skills, in some ways, bore slight similarities to the evil spirits, both characterized by vague features and terrifying appearances.

What drew Yang Kai's attention even more was that the few evil spirits they faced seemed a bit different from those he had encountered earlier.

The evil spirits he had faced were green, while those before them were blood-red, looking even more chilling.

Moreover, these red evil spirits were undoubtedly stronger than the green ones, their wispy bodies appearing far more solid.

Thus, even though this group outnumbered Tao Yang and the others, they couldn’t achieve victory in a short time.

Four or five red evil spirits surrounded them, occasionally letting out sharp shrieks, which seemed to resonate with each other, allowing them to act in unison. If one missed an attack, they would retreat instantly, acting with mutual understanding, making them much more troublesome compared to the green spirits.

However, in terms of the overall scene, this group of martial artists had the advantage, and after a moment of effort, the bodies of the red evil spirits began to dim. Once one of them was shattered, the balance tilted toward the martial artists.

The ghost face martial skills were repeatedly unleashed, destroying the red evil spirits effortlessly.

Unbeknownst to them, one of the red evil spirits, before its demise, suddenly bypassed the group and pounced directly toward Yang Kai.

Furrowing his brow, Yang Kai didn’t dodge but reached out to test the combat power of this red evil spirit. He released his True Yuan to meet it head-on.

With a single palm strike, the red evil spirit shattered amidst its wails, leaving behind a mass of evil spirit essence floating before Yang Kai.

This mass of evil spirit essence was evidently much better than what Yang Kai had obtained before.

Initially, Yang Kai had no intention of laying claim to this mass of evil spirit essence, but it seemed that having just devoured energy had whetted the appetite of the Proud Bone Golden Body, which unexpectedly generated a pulling force, directly drawing this mass of evil spirit essence into his body.

By the time he sensed something was off, it was already too late. Yang Kai couldn’t help but be dumbfounded, feeling rather helpless.

The group of martial artists had originally been shocked to see Yang Kai obliterate the evil spirit in one blow, but now witnessing him shamelessly claim the essence, their expressions immediately darkened, turning unfriendly.

“Hey, friend, isn’t this a bit deceitful?” A handsome young man stepped forward, gazing at Yang Kai with a gloomy expression.

“Uh, sorry, I didn’t mean to.” Aware of his own guilt, Yang Kai didn’t bother to argue.

“Didn’t mean to?” The young man sneered, “Taking away the essence that belongs to us, are you really still going to claim it was unintentional?”

Though Yang Kai's earlier display had surprised him, he showed no fear. After all, they had seven or eight people on their side, and moreover, Yang Kai’s excuse was hardly convincing.

In broad daylight, forcefully seizing something wasn't unintentional, was it?

Hearing him, the others moved forward, coldly scrutinizing Yang Kai, their expressions indicating that they were not about to let this go.

Only one graceful young woman, who had been hiding behind the others, stepped forward gracefully, her beautiful face slightly paling as she gazed at Yang Kai with a hint of fear in her eyes, her delicate body trembling slightly.

She recalled the inhumane torment and unbearable pain she had endured.

“Friend, let’s draw a line; our Ghost King Valley may not be a large sect, but we are not easily trifled with.” The grim-faced young man coldly stared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned, responding apathetically, “I’ll compensate you.”

“Compensate? How?” The young man snorted lightly.

“That's not necessary.” Before Yang Kai could reply, the young woman who had stepped forward looked at Yang Kai with a calm gaze, her fear now receding. “No need for your compensation.”

“Junior Sister...” The young man looked at the girl with disbelief, unsure why she would say such a thing.

“I know him! No need to fuss over this,” the girl said coldly. When she looked at Yang Kai, a slight blush crept onto her face as she remembered the ridiculous incident where Zi Mo and she had teased him in that other realm.

At that time, believing Zimo's foolish words, she thought he had a hidden ailment, only to find that he had taken quite a bit of advantage from her.

“You know him?” The young man was even more baffled, glancing between the girl and Yang Kai, his head reeling.

“Yeah, he is kind of my savior,” the girl finally revealed a smile, albeit a forced and stiff one.

“Cold girl, it’s good to see you again.” Yang Kai smiled at the young woman.

This young woman was none other than Leng Shan from Ghost King Valley!

Both Zi Mo and Leng Shan had Yang Kai’s Divine Sense seal in their minds, allowing him to sense their presence as long as they were not too far apart. However, Yang Kai hadn’t expected to encounter Leng Shan here.

“Yes, it’s good to see you again.” Leng Shan nodded slightly, feeling relieved in her heart. It seemed this man had no intention to reveal what had happened in the other realm nor to use the soul seal to torment her further.

Though she had long known that Yang Kai was not inherently bad, Leng Shan still felt a bit apprehensive.

Seeing that the two were indeed familiar with each other, the disciples of Ghost King Valley exchanged glances, and the hostility from the grim young man also subsided considerably.

“You should refine the evil spirit essence first. If you absorb it and don’t refine it soon, it could become harmful,” Leng Shan softly advised, then turned to the others, “You all collect the essence and stay alert around; don’t let any evil spirits take advantage of the situation.”

“Oh.” The group swiftly got to work.

Yang Kai, too, chuckled as he began to operate the True Yang Technique.

The essence from the red evil spirits truly was different, containing a far higher energy than that from the green spirits.

After a moment, Yang Kai felt light throughout his body and said, “Alright.”

“Alright?” The grim young man exclaimed, frowning as he looked at Yang Kai, “Friend, refining evil spirit essence isn’t usually this quick. Did you refine it thoroughly? This stuff is no joke; if it’s not refined properly, there’s a high chance of leaving behind some hidden dangers.”

He kindly reminded Yang Kai, evidently because Leng Shan had mentioned he was her savior; otherwise, such a drastic change in attitude would be unlikely.

“Yeah, I practice a Yang attribute cultivation method, which specifically counters this,” Yang Kai explained lightly.

“I see! No wonder you were able to eliminate that red evil spirit in one move; your strength was a bit excessive. Ha-ha! Turns out it’s because of the attributes of your True Yuan that countered it. You really startled me!” The grim young man’s mood brightened as he laughed.

“Let’s get acquainted, my name is Shen Yi. I was rude earlier; please don’t hold it against me.”

“Yang Kai!”

Since the other party was willing to reconcile, Yang Kai naturally wouldn’t hold a grudge, after all, it was indeed his mistake.
