## Chapter 1210 — Pursuit and Slaughter

Though his body had undergone a tremendous change, the aura on that fat man multiplied, and the Saint Yuan surging from him nearly congealed into substance; with a wave of both hands, green beams of light danced from his palms, forming vine-like tendrils in midair that coiled toward Yang Kai.

Relying on his unique Saint Yuan and his distinctive killing moves, he had slain countless enemies; within the Battle Sky Alliance his renown, while not matching Qu Changfeng or the middle-aged man, already marked him as a core figure.

Moreover, the wood-attributed vines spread and grew at an astonishing speed. Given just three breaths of time, he could use them to seal off the entire gorge, turning it into a prison. When that happened, this place would be his domain — and no matter how capable that First-Stage Saint King Realm cultivator was, he would never escape from the vine cage.

Confidence filled his eyes.

But a plume of inky black flames, like a fire-dragon, leapt forth and doused that confidence with a bucket of cold water.

"A fire-element cultivator?" The fat man’s face registered alarm.

His wood cultivation techniques and martial skills were precisely countered by fire, so when he saw Yang Kai produce that pitch-black flame his heart sank and his expression turned grave.

Yet an arrow once loosed cannot be recalled; a single First Stage of the Saint King Realm opponent was not enough to make him hold back. He increased his Saint Yuan output, and the many green vines grew even more frenzied, threatening to envelop the entire canyon.

Hoo—

The fire suddenly became ferocious. Then the sight that truly terrified the fat man occurred: the black flame rolled in and burned every green tendril he had produced into flying ash, no matter how many he unleashed they could not keep pace with the rate of incineration. In the blink of an eye the black fire had reached him.

"Impossible!" the fat man cried. His martial skill was indeed countered by fire, but no flame should possess such overwhelming consuming power to prevent his vines from proliferating.

The sky’s green was instantly suppressed by the black blaze; within the canyon a cold-and-heat alternation washed over everything, torturing the fat man.

Yang Kai now surged forward like a blazing inferno. A pitch-black Heaven-Slaying Spear was hurled during his charge, whistling toward the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator; he himself trailed the spear, slamming down a Heaven-Covering Palm.

He had to end this quickly—the cautiousness of that pale-faced middle-aged man exceeded Yang Kai’s expectations. After the man’s two fellow disciples had been slain, his first reaction was not vengeance but an immediate retreat, a decisiveness that defied comprehension.

This was a terrifying individual, capable of suppressing the covetousness toward his Spatial Ring’s treasures and choosing the most prudent course.

Now the middle-aged man had already run dozens of zhang away; if Yang Kai continued to entangle with the fat man, once the other escaped the canyon he would indeed be beyond pursuit.

So Yang Kai struck in fury, unleashing nearly all his strength.

The fat man reacted quickly; seeing the black Heaven-Slaying Spear, he immediately produced a small round shield. The little shield spun, its surface full of intricate runes and energy lines, and a turtle-shaped pattern swam within it, lively as if animate. The small round shield guarded before him as he twisted his body to retreat.

But a great hand that seemed to blanket heaven and earth slammed down from above, giving him the false illusion that there was nowhere to dodge.

Boom—

With a tremendous crash the Heaven-Slaying Spear struck the little shield, a massive release of energy breaking out; with a crisp crack the shield split, yet surprisingly did not shatter. Though stained with some demonic flame, the turtle pattern flashed and rose from the shield, then opened its mouth and sprayed a white, misty energy that immediately extinguished the demonic flame.

Having done so, the turtle-pattern sank back into the small shield, but it no longer moved and had grown sluggish and heavy.

That secret treasure had clearly lost much of its spiritual responsiveness; unless a skilled artificer repaired it, it could not be used again.

The little shield had blocked Yang Kai’s killing blow and saved the fat man’s life, but the Heaven-Covering Palm slammed down heavily at that moment.

The fat man screamed, quickly forming complex hand seals. Two palms thrust toward the sky and then pushed out violently.

A green light-screen rose with his movement, like a protective dome that enveloped him beneath.

Another tremendous boom shook the earth. The Heaven-Covering Palm struck that green light-screen; both the screen and the giant palm print shattered simultaneously and vanished, and though the fat man did not suffer grievous wounds, his face paled—he had taken a loss.

In that short time he immediately recognized the gap between himself and Yang Kai.

This was not the strength a First Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivator should be able to display; even a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm could not manifest such power. If not for the unmistakable fluctuation of Saint Yuan within Yang Kai, he would have suspected the youth to be an Origin Returning Realm expert in disguise.

No wonder the other had the confidence to attack—such power could contend with Qu Changfeng, and dealing with him would be trivial.

He had already used his secret treasure, while the other seemed not yet to have revealed his full strength—merely employing martial skills without bothering to deploy a treasure.

He did not know that Yang Kai had only two secret treasures: a Purple Shield and the Hundred Mountains Painting.

The Purple Shield was for defense; the Hundred Mountains Painting, though formidable, was unsuitable in the narrow canyon—otherwise Yang Kai would have summoned twenty mountain phantoms to crush him and spared no trouble.

The fat man sensed danger. After blocking the Heaven-Covering Palm he produced another secret treasure shaped like a throwing knife, infused Saint Yuan into it, and casually tossed it at Yang Kai.

The flying knife became a white streak aimed at Yang Kai’s face, filled with murderous intent. At the same time, the fat man spun and fled toward the canyon’s exit without looking back.

He believed his flying-knife treasure would buy him time—if only a moment, perhaps he could escape with his life. But the moment his back turned to Yang Kai a chill of death attacked from behind.

He turned back in terror to find Yang Kai had dodged the flying knife and now wielded a pitch-black long sword, hacking continuously; terrifying black sword lights filled the canyon.

The fat man’s heart trembled; before he could form any thought ten-plus sword lights struck him together. He screamed and collapsed, demonic flame burning his body; no matter how he urged Saint Yuan, he could not extinguish it, and he was soon burned to a charred corpse.

The canyon was only two or three zhang wide; there was little room to dodge. If he had been able to maneuver, he might have delayed longer and not died so swiftly.

Dying, he could not understand why a mere First Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivator could be so terrifying.

After slaying the fat man, Yang Kai immediately looked up toward the canyon entrance.

The last middle-aged man indeed ran swiftly—already more than two hundred zhang away in that brief time.

He seemed to have heard the fat man’s scream; his figure trembled and his speed increased.

Now he realized his caution had been justified. The fat man’s scream clearly announced his death—whoever had killed his fellow disciple in five breaths, whatever method or trick employed, was beyond his ability to resist.

Thus he did not dare turn back; he only thought to leave the canyon as quickly as possible. With a trembling hand he reached into his Spatial Ring for the Transmission Compass, intending to notify his fellow disciples, preferably Qu Changfeng.

In his eyes only someone like Qu Changfeng could stand against that youth.

Just as he drew out the Transmission Compass, a roll of wind and thunder erupted behind him and a soul-chilling Divine Sense enveloped him—its strength rivaled that of some Origin Returning Realm experts.

He dared not delay and poured his Divine Sense into the Transmission Compass, but before he could speak his arm holding the communication compass felt a slight pain.

The pain was like an ant bite.

When he checked, he was horrified to find his arm had been silently severed, and not far away a pitch-black, blade-shaped rift that seemed to devour everything flew alongside him.

"A spatial rift?" The cultivator, experienced as he was, muttered; as he spoke the thing he had thought a rift wavered and vanished.

The fierce pain at the stump made sweat bead on his brow and drenched his clothes.

Hiss—

A faint, nearly imperceptible sound reached his ear, and his remaining intact arm throbbed in pain.

Thinking of what had just happened, the middle-aged cultivator’s face went ashen; he glanced and found his second arm was indeed gone, the cuts neat as if struck by a sharp blade.

A figure flashed past at lightning speed and intercepted before him.

The middle-aged man halted and stared at Yang Kai in a daze, despair written across his face.

He paid no heed to the pain in his stumps or the spurting blood; he merely stared at Yang Kai and the pair of wind-and-thunder power wings flickering behind him, finally understanding why, despite his frantic flight, the other could overtake him so easily.
