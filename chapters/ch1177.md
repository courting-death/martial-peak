## Chapter 1177 — Strange Valley

Three days later, Yang Kai burst into a region that resembled a valley; during those three days he had been hurrying along. With the help of his Wind-and-Thunder Wings his speed was far greater than ordinary people’s. Aside from an incidental encounter with an Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast which he had to fight hard to kill, nothing else had happened.

That Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast’s body had already consolidated to a certain degree, and when it suddenly sprang from an underground fissure it truly startled Yang Kai. If he hadn’t reacted quickly and had the Wind-and-Thunder Wings assisting him, that single sneak attack alone would have been enough to wound him.

Only then did he understand that the real danger of the Fire Spirit Beasts didn’t lie in their raw power, but in how perfectly they blended with the environment of this Flowing Flame Sandland; if they didn’t actively reveal themselves, cultivators simply couldn’t detect them.

Yet their appearances were always accompanied by deadly ambushes.

An Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast was equivalent to a Saint King Realm; if any other cultivator had been on the receiving end of that ambush they would likely already be dead.

Fortunately Yang Kai managed to slay it and obtained a crystal stone the size of a pigeon’s egg.

This Crystal Stone was much larger than the one he’d first obtained and certainly not of low value. If an alchemist or artificer could perfectly fuse the pure Spiritual Qi stored within into a Pill or a Secret Treasure, it would raise the rank and quality of that Pill or Secret Treasure.

Such a harvest cheered him, and he couldn’t help thinking of finding another Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast to kill — after all, he himself was an alchemist, and these things were useful to him.

Entering the valley, Yang Kai kept his Divine Sense covering a thirty zhang radius around him, afraid of being ambushed again by a powerful Fire Spirit Beast.

The terrain here was strange: in all directions there were barren high mountains, and the whole valley looked like a huge pit carved into the earth. The valley was so vast its far edge couldn’t be seen; within it, gullies crisscrossed in every direction. The larger ravines looked like split bottomless abysses, chilling to the bone.

Yang Kai paid it little mind and activated his Wind-and-Thunder Wings, pressing deeper forward.

He and Wei Guchang had the same idea: get to the heaven-and-earth treasure area as soon as possible, and while few people had entered yet collect some Spiritual Herbs and Medicines. Once the elites of the major forces all flooded in, the good stuff to be gathered would be scarce.

Everyone was probably racing against time. Yang Kai’s Wind-and-Thunder Wings gave him a significant advantage.

Half a day later Yang Kai had already reached the interior of the valley, and strangely enough he hadn’t encountered a single Fire Spirit Beast in that half day. Beforehand, even with the best luck, one or two Fire Spirit Beasts would pop up every hour or two and bar the path, but now half a day had gone by with no sign of them, which puzzled him.

It seemed as if this valley were a forbidden area for Fire Spirit Beasts — they simply didn’t come here.

Yang Kai was delighted and rode forward with his head down.

But suddenly Yang Kai’s expression changed; in a flash he darted to one side.

His earlier Divine Sense probing had sensed a slight abnormal energy fluctuation; Yang Kai was very familiar with that kind of fluctuation — it was the sign that Fire Spirit Beasts were about to spring from underground fissures to ambush.

Sure enough, after his position shifted several Fire Spirit Beasts of varying shapes and ranks burst up from the place he’d just been standing.

Yang Kai had intended to ignore them and press on, but before he could steady himself the abnormal energy fluctuation appeared beneath his feet again.

Yang Kai frowned and changed position once more.

A third energy fluctuation came from beneath his feet...

At the same time, from all directions the whole valley seemed to boil; chaotic energies rose and fell, and streams of fire shot out from the crisscrossing fissures. They swelled into the air and transformed into all manner of grotesque Fire Spirit Beasts.

The flames leaping from the fissures were astonishingly numerous, countless in number, and farther away even more firelight was flashing.

Finally Yang Kai’s face turned grim.

Something about this valley was very wrong!

He had never imagined the Fire Spirit Beasts would be so densely concentrated, and this place was nothing like the forbidden area he had assumed — it was plainly their paradise.

Who knew why so many Fire Spirit Beasts had gathered here? In just a few breaths Yang Kai found himself trapped in a ring of encirclement, Fire Spirit Beasts lurking around him with hungry, malicious intent.

Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense and his expression deepened.

Within just a hundred zhang around him there were already more than ten thousand Fire Spirit Beasts. Most were Fifth- and Sixth-Tier specimens, but there were Seventh- and Eighth-Tier ones mixed in. Farther out still more Fire Spirit Beasts were surging forward in endless waves.

Yang Kai felt as if he had unintentionally poked a giant hornets’ nest; his face was extremely ugly.

Not being able to fly meant he had to cut his way out of this encirclement; with so many Fire Spirit Beasts, how long would he have to keep killing to survive?

As Yang Kai hesitated, a beastly roar sounded and the Fire Spirit Beasts gathered around him launched an attack, surging at him in packs. Their faces bared teeth and feral fangs; among them came fiery energy attacks — fireballs spewed from their mouths, fire-serpent-like strikes lunged at Yang Kai, and arrow-like attacks shot with tremendous speed, the sound of air being split constant.

Those energy attacks could only be produced by Fire Spirit Beasts that had reached Seventh-Tier level.

Yang Kai bellowed, his Saint Yuan swelling. A long sword burning with Demonic Flame appeared in his hand, and he slashed fiercely forward. A world-shattering sword light roared out; every Fifth- and Sixth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast struck by that blade was ground to powder and dispersed into the air.

He swept his hand again and a dozen ink-black spears wreathed in Demonic Flame shot out in all directions. Each spear did great deeds, piercing countless Fire Spirit Beasts’ bodies before fading away.

The Profound Heaven Sword and the Heaven-Slaying Spear — Yang Kai repeatedly unleashed these two moves from the Nine Heavens Divine Technique, cutting down the waves of charging Fire Spirit Beasts by the scores.

If others encountered such a flood of Fire Spirit Beasts, even in groups they would likely be doomed, because there were simply too many; even if most were easy to kill, wiping them all out would expend enormous energy.

Perhaps before cultivators had killed them all their strength would be exhausted and they would be swallowed by the hordes.

Yang Kai was different; he never worried about the amount of power stored in his body. He had once stored Yang Liquid; now that his Saint Yuan had transformed into Demonic Flame, all his power was contained in his flesh and blood.

His Saint Yuan reserves exceeded those of any Saint King Realm by hundreds or even thousands of times; even Origin Returning Realm cultivators could not compare.

He freely poured out his Saint Yuan, teaching those surging Fire Spirit Beasts what it meant to be cut down like wheat.

Soon Yang Kai frowned.

When that great swarm of Fire Spirit Beasts first appeared he had indeed been startled for a moment, but the next instant he became excited.

With so many Fire Spirit Beasts, how many Crystal Stones could he harvest? Even if the Crystal Stones inside Fifth- and Sixth-Tier beasts were of little use, those from Seventh- and Eighth-Tier ones could certainly be used for alchemy and forging.

But now he discovered something strange: the Fire Spirit Beasts he killed seemed essentially different from those outside — their bodies contained no Crystal Stones at all.

In the space of a tea break Yang Kai had slain at least three hundred Fifth- and Sixth-Tier beasts, and a dozen or so Seventh-Tier ones; strangely, whether Fifth-, Sixth- or Seventh-Tier, none of them left even a single Crystal Stone when they dispersed.

This was not right! Yang Kai couldn’t fathom it. After more slaughter he suddenly fixed his gaze on an Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast not far away.

He wanted to know whether that fellow’s body was the same.

With a half-moon sweep of his Demonic Flame sword, the Fire Spirit Beasts brushed by withered and collapsed at once. Yang Kai quickly cut a gap through the horde and charged straight at the Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast.

Before he arrived a Heaven-Slaying Spear had already shot through the air.

The Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast was somewhat extraordinary; it dove into the crowd and used a dozen companions’ bodies to shield itself from the spear’s attack. Before Yang Kai could strike again it opened its mouth and spat out a fiery blast.

Yang Kai neither dodged nor retreated. With Saint Yuan surging he endured the rampaging fire blast, stepped to the side and arrived before it. His Demonic Flame long sword cleaved down toward its head.

The Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast failed to evade; the sword light split a foot-long crack in its skull, and after the light’s ravage the Eighth-Tier Fire Spirit Beast let out a whimper and vanished.

Yang Kai searched carefully and found that it too had no Crystal Stone.

At that moment Yang Kai nearly burst into a string of curses. Being trapped here by innumerable Fire Spirit Beasts would have been bad enough, but to have nothing to gain after killing them was intolerable.

If he could harvest a mass of Crystal Stones the slaughter would have been worth something; with nothing to show for it, why should he bother lingering and entangling himself with them?

With a roar a jet-black behemoth dragon dozens of zhang long suddenly rolled out from Yang Kai’s body — it was formed from the golden dragon pattern on his body.

But after being infused with Yang Kai’s unique Saint Yuan it had taken on the present form: utterly jet-black, Demonic Flame burning and surging, with dragon eyes larger than a human face, exuding tremendous presence.

The black behemoth dragon thrashed and surged into the Fire Spirit Beast horde, laying into them with savage rampage. The dense Fire Spirit Beasts fled in panic; any that touched it were destroyed and the rest scattered.

At the same time Yang Kai summoned the Purple Shield crafted for him by Yang Flame to guard his back against attacks from behind. In his hand he also produced the Hundred Mountains Painting that once belonged to the Xu Family; mountain-phantom peaks flew forth from the painting like piled mountains and crashed down on the Fire Spirit Beasts.

Yang Kai’s strength far exceeded Xu Zhishen’s; Xu Zhishen could originally only summon six mountain phantoms, but Yang Kai could easily summon eight, and showed no strain at all.
