## Chapter 1923 — Star Emperor Tokens Gather

Time passed like flowing water; in the blink of an eye it had been two years.

During those two years, Yang Kai had been constantly on the move, arranging Great Space Arrays for the Hengluo Commerce Guild's eighteen stars.

The stars the Hengluo Commerce Guild owned were spread very far apart, so the traveling truly cost Yang Kai a great deal of effort; otherwise, with his skill, merely laying down Space Arrays would not have taken more than two or three months.

Most of the time had been spent aboard the warships.

After two years, the Hengluo Commerce Guild's eighteen stars were completely linked together; with the array in Shuitian City as the hub, coming and going by teleportation could be easily achieved.

During those two years, Xue Yue had accompanied Yang Kai at his side.

With a beauty accompanying him, the journey was naturally far from dull.

One day, the group finally returned to Shuiyue Star.

Ni Guang received Yang Kai with great ceremony and, on behalf of the Commerce Guild, repeatedly thanked him for his efforts two years prior; because of those Great Space Arrays, the Hengluo Commerce Guild would save vast amounts of time and resources in transportation from then on.

Ai Ou had not appeared; after some questioning from Xue Yue, they learned Ai Ou had already departed for a cultivation star he had long sought, to refine a Stellar Origin.

This matter was of grave importance; within the whole Hengluo Commerce Guild only Long Tianshang and Ni Guang knew—everyone else assumed Ai Ou was merely in seclusion.

Xue Yue could not help but show a worried expression upon hearing this.

After all, refining a Stellar Origin was far too perilous; generally only those whose power had reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm could hope to refine one successfully—those at the Second Stage stood little to no chance.

Back then, the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, Luo Hai, had been a real exception.

Ai Ou's cultivation now barely reached the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, and she was still only a woman of flesh and blood—no wonder Xue Yue was filled with worry.

Yang Kai comforted her and explained the power of the Star Refining Technique, which eased Xue Yue's mood considerably.

"Yang Kai. Someone wants to see you." Ni Guang suddenly moved to Yang Kai's side and said in a low voice.

"Who?" Yang Kai asked, looking at him in surprise.

Ni Guang smiled: "You'll know if you come with me."

Yang Kai did not ask further and followed Ni Guang into a secret chamber.

Inside the chamber were only three people—one man and two women; the man was not old, with sword-like brows and starry eyes, handsome and stately; the two women were like spring orchid and autumn chrysanthemum, as if sister-flowers, attending on either side.

Seeing Yang Kai arrive, the man in the center laughed heartily and clasped his fists: "Brother Yang, we meet again."

Yang Kai was taken aback and said in astonishment: "Brother Gu, how are you here?"

He had not expected that the person waiting for him on Shuiyue Star would be the Sword Alliance's Young Alliance Master, Gu Jianxin.

He and Gu Jianxin had met once before and spent some time together; although they were not deeply close, they found each other agreeable. Years apart, Gu Jianxin's cultivation seemed increasingly robust, faintly not far from the Void King Realm—if his opportunities were sufficient, given some time to settle he might attempt a breakthrough.

The two women at Gu Jianxin's side were naturally his Sword Servants, Lingyue and Anxing!

These two women had grown up with Gu Jianxin; the three of them—master and attendants—had cultivated a secret art together that was not passed on to outsiders. In battle they fought as one, their combined might extraordinary, and their bond was exceptionally close. Gu Jianxin never treated his two sword servants as mere subordinates; when Li Minghai, a Void King Realm expert, once launched a fierce assault, Gu Jianxin even risked his life to protect Lingyue and Anxing.

Such conduct was one of the reasons Yang Kai felt favorable toward him.

Only those who valued sentiment and righteousness were worthy of becoming friends.

"Greetings, Young Master Yang!" Lingyue and Anxing were not strangers; upon seeing Yang Kai they hurriedly performed a salute and called out crisply.

"You two are too polite." Yang Kai smiled and returned their salute.

"Brother Yang, are you surprised that I would wait here for you?" Gu Jianxin looked at Yang Kai with a playful smile.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, many thoughts flashing through his mind, then he said: "A little surprised, but... also within expectation."

"It seems Brother Yang knows why I have come."

"I have my suspicions; Brother Gu, please speak plainly." Yang Kai said seriously.

Gu Jianxin nodded: "Talking with you is always straightforward; in that case I'll be blunt."

As he spoke he took something from his Spatial Ring and handed it to Yang Kai: "Take a look at this."

"A Star Emperor Token!" Yang Kai's eyes lit up as he quickly accepted the object from Gu Jianxin's hand.

It was clearly the final Star Emperor Token, identical to the others he had previously collected; with this piece, the nine Star Emperor Tokens the Great Emperor had made were now all gathered!

Gu Jianxin smiled slightly: "My father entrusted me to bring this to you; he said you very much needed it."

"Alliance Master Gu?" Yang Kai was momentarily stunned, then solemnly put the last Star Emperor Token away and asked: "Does Alliance Master Gu have any conditions?"

He had no deep ties to the Sword Alliance, only a bit of friendship with Gu Jianxin personally; Yang Kai did not believe the Alliance Master Gu Cangyun would hand over a Star Emperor Token for nothing—there were obviously other conditions.

Gu Jianxin laughed heartily, turned to Ni Guang at his side and said, "Conditions? Naturally there are. Senior Ni, please explain them in full."

Yang Kai turned his head and looked at Ni Guang.

Ni Guang cleared his throat and said, "It's like this, Yang Kai: before the President went into seclusion he already settled this matter for you. Alliance Master Gu is willing to entrust this Star Emperor Token to your use and to be counted among the six, but... the condition is that you must go to the Sword Alliance and lay out Great Space Arrays for them!"

"Just as I expected!" Yang Kai smiled bitterly.

He had already foreseen this, but when he learned the Sword Alliance's demand was the same, he still felt somewhat worn out.

After all, his arranging of the Great Space Arrays for the Hengluo Commerce Guild had not been done in a day or two; the Sword Alliance also had its intelligence network and certainly could have discovered it.

No power was not envious of the Great Space Arrays!

Yang Kai glumly looked at Gu Jianxin and asked: "How many Cultivation Stars does your Sword Alliance have?"

Gu Jianxin chuckled: "Not many—fewer than the Hengluo Commerce Guild, only seventeen!"

Yang Kai put a hand to his forehead.

It had taken him two years to arrange the Great Space Array for the Hengluo Commerce Guild's eighteen stars; Sword Alliance's seventeen would likely take about two years as well.

"The able should do more," Gu Jianxin said in consolation, "our Sword Alliance is counting on you."

"Besides that, are there any other conditions?" Yang Kai asked.

Gu Jianxin forced a laugh: "Apart from that, our alchemists have unanimously requested that Master Yang hold an alchemy lecture on pill-refining once on the Sword Alliance's main star!"

"This has been spread around?" Yang Kai felt a headache coming on.

"Brother Yang, perhaps you still don't know your renown across the Star Domain? Your fame is now at its height! A Second Stage of the Void King Realm with the identity of a Void King-Grade alchemist—who can be compared to you? Brewing Spiritual Pills that evoke the Great Dao Pill Tone, this will be sung through the ages."

Ni Guang solemnly nodded: "Yang Kai, you've been traveling these two years and perhaps missed the rumors, but your name truly has become widely known across the Star Domain."

Gu Jianxin continued: "Of course, the Sword Alliance will not make you work for nothing; for each Great Space Array laid we will pay sufficient reward—please do not refuse, Brother Yang."

As he spoke he performed a proper salute.

Before coming, Gu Cangyun had said that if he could not bring Yang Kai to the Sword Alliance he should not return; those words from his father were still fresh in his mind, and Gu Jianxin dared not be careless.

Yang Kai considered for a moment and nodded: "Brother Gu need not go to such lengths. I will agree to this."

"Truly?" Gu Jianxin rejoiced, "That's excellent. When will Brother Yang depart? The distance from here to the Sword Alliance is not slight!"

"Tomorrow. Directly to Qingmu Star."

"Qingmu Star?" Gu Jianxin was a little puzzled, but soon seemed to understand something and exclaimed: "Have you arranged a Great Space Array on Qingmu Star?"

"Yes." Yang Kai smiled slightly and acknowledged it.

"That will save a lot of time; in that case I will await Brother Yang's good news."

After leaving Gu Jianxin, Yang Kai went straight to find Xue Yue and told her his upcoming itinerary; although she was somewhat reluctant, she had no power to stop him.

Besides, she knew Yang Kai would soon be heading to a place called the Star Realm; if she wished to follow him she would have to train and raise her cultivation, otherwise she would only become a burden.

"Don't worry; after you leave I will go into seclusion and strive to break through to the Void King Realm!" Xue Yue vowed inwardly, "All your other women are so outstanding—I don't want to be at the bottom."

Yang Kai chuckled: "Don't put too much pressure on yourself—you are excellent as well."

Xue Yue immediately smiled sweetly.

"By the way, when Senior Ai Ou returns safely, remember to give him this." Yang Kai suddenly produced an object and handed it to Xue Yue.

"What is it?" she asked.

"A Star Chart, to guide him where to go to search for me," Yang Kai explained.

"I understand."

"One more thing: there's still one candidate left—ask your father or Senior Long to pay attention; if there's a reliable person, invite them."

"Okay, I'll remember."

That night Yang Kai explained the mysteries of the Void King Realm and the methods for refining a Domain to Xue Yue until dawn, and the two of them parted reluctantly.

Gu Jianxin and his Sword Servants Lingyue and Anxing had long since made ready; once Yang Kai was prepared they could depart immediately.

The group went straight to the Great Space Array hub in Shuitian City; Yang Kai made slight adjustments and connected it with the array on Twin Shark Island of Qingmu Star, and under the watchful eyes of the gathered, his figure gradually vanished.

When their sight returned, Yang Kai, Gu Jianxin and the other three had already arrived at Twin Shark Island on Qingmu Star, inside Yang Kai's palace.

Yue Xi and the master-disciple pair He Zao and He Miao, who had been guarding the palace, hurried out to greet them; years later their cultivation had all advanced greatly—He Zao and He Miao had even reached the Origin Returning Realm, which was gratifying.
