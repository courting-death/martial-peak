## Chapter 607 — Stripping the True Spirit from the Jade

"The Spiritual Qi in Zhongdu is barely acceptable now, but over there the world is saturated with such dense Spiritual Qi everywhere. In the regions occupied by the great forces, the Spiritual Qi is more than an order of magnitude thicker than here in Zhongdu, and there are countless blessed places and Sacred Lands; Zhongdu cannot compare to those places at all."

Shui Ling spoke lightly, yet everyone present grasped the depth and terror of that other world, and their eyes reddened slightly.

The dense Spiritual Qi in Zhongdu now was already the Sacred Land they had long yearned for.

Yet Shui Ling said that over there no place would be any worse than present-day Zhongdu, and there were places even better — how could they not long for it?

Abundant, rich Spiritual Qi means martial artists cultivate with half the effort and twice the result, able to rapidly raise their strength and cultivation.

Such differences in terrain and advantage have always been the goal of contention among martial artists.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and finally understood how Shui Ling, who was barely older than him, had already reached the Divine Roaming Realm, Eighth Stage, half a year ago, and now had reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, only one step from ascending to the Transcendent Realm.

To possess that cultivation at such an age was terrifying.

"You know that above Divine Roaming is called the Transcendent Realm, but above the Transcendent Realm — do you know what it is called?" Shui Ling smiled faintly.

"Please tell us!" Yang Zhao's eyes brightened; he asked respectfully.

"Saint Realm! Above the Transcendent Realm is the Saint Realm." Shui Ling did not tease them, revealing the truth. "Only forces that have Saint Realm experts sitting in command can be considered truly top-tier. My Water Divine Hall has only one such person, so we can barely be called a First-rate force. Correspondingly, the grades of Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures and heaven-and-earth treasures — where you top out at Mystery-Grade here, over on our side there are still higher Spirit-Grade and Saint-Grade Secret Treasures and Pills."

"Spirit-Grade, Saint-Grade?" Everyone was greatly shocked.

Shui Ling frowned. "I don't know what's happening here. It seems there is some binding in the void that not only restrains your martial development but also limits the grade of Secret Treasures and Pills you can refine."

Shui Ling was quite forthcoming and did not conceal the conditions of that world.

In the main hall people asked questions in a dozen different voices; the more they learned, the more terrified they became, for everything there far exceeded their comprehension.

A long conversation passed in an instant; no one felt bored — they all seemed transformed into eager scholar youths, drinking in the unknown experience and insight from Shui Ling.

By evening everyone’s throats were dry from questioning; Shui Ling grew irritated, able to handle a question or two, but faced with a hundred people each with their own question she was exhausted.

"Enough." Yang Kai, seeing her expression, stopped them. "Don't ask any more. The more you ask, the more unsettled you'll become."

"Even so, you still intend to go there?" Ling Taixu watched Yang Kai intently.

Yang Kai nodded heavily. "I must go."

"Su Yan is still there, Xia Ningshang is still there — no matter what, I have to find the two of them."

"I support you!" Ling Taixu smiled faintly. "A man should be like this; one must not be bound to a single small place."

"Thank you, Master!"

With Ling Taixu's approval, Fourth Master Yang and his wife naturally had nothing more to say. Though reluctant, this was Yang Kai's pursuit; how could they stop him?

"I'll go scout the route first; maybe in the future everyone can go." Yang Kai smiled slightly. "Having Shui Ling tell you this was also to make you aware of how far behind you are. After I leave, don't slack off — perhaps one day I'll return and bring you all along; if your strength is insufficient then, it will be a problem."

"Naturally." Huo Xingchen's eyes burned with fighting spirit. "We might not have known before, but now that we do we cannot remain lax. We all have two arms and a head — why should those people be better than us?"

Everyone nodded in agreement, spirits high.

After the crowd dispersed, soon only Yang Kai and Shui Ling remained in the main hall.

Yang Kai looked at her with puzzlement; he did not understand why she had deliberately stayed to wait for him.

"When are you leaving?" Shui Ling asked anxiously.

"What business is that of yours?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

"Naturally it concerns me. Your servant Di Mo said he would one day take me back. Otherwise, why do you think I've been staying here helping you?" Shui Ling said.

Yang Kai was startled, then suddenly laughed. "Don't tell me you don't know the way back?"

Shui Ling's face was awkward as she nodded slightly.

Yang Kai laughed heartily. "No wonder — I wondered why you suddenly became so obliging. So that's why."

"You know the way back, right?"

Yang Kai gave no definite answer.

"Whatever. I don't care — I'm coming with you."

"Come along then — I just so happen to need a guide." Yang Kai did not refuse.

"When shall we set off?" Shui Ling became excited; although Yang Kai had not spoken, his composed manner showed he clearly knew the route home.

"It will take a bit of time. I have some matters to deal with," Yang Kai thought for a moment. "At most, a month."

"Good." Shui Ling nodded cheerfully.

After leaving the Yang family, Yang Kai walked toward his own residence.

Ling Taixu had just told him that since Meng Wuya's disappearance, the Heavenly Journey Palace that enclosed the residence could no longer be driven; although it still unfolded a barrier to protect the residence, besides Ling Taixu no one could enter — others could leave but not enter.

So now the entire mansion was empty.

The Heavenly Journey Palace was a very powerful Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure. Since Yang Kai had decided to go find Su Yan and the others, he naturally wished to take this relic with him and return it to Meng Wuya.

Arriving outside the mansion, Yang Kai stepped inside; as he had guessed, the Heavenly Journey Palace opened a passage on its own, allowing Yang Kai to pass through safely.

This must have been set by Meng Wuya: only Yang Kai and Ling Taixu could freely enter and exit the Heavenly Journey Palace. Others could only leave; to enter from outside required Meng Wuya's consent.

In the silent mansion Yang Kai spread his Divine Sense, probing every corner and carefully investigating the mysteries of the Heavenly Journey Palace.

The Heavenly Journey Palace's true body was only a palm-sized miniature palace, yet once infused with True Yuan it could unfold a barrier. Now Yang Kai wanted to find it, but it was not easy.

He searched hard for a long time but found no clue.

Yang Kai did not hurry. Though he wanted to take the Heavenly Journey Palace to return it to Meng Wuya, if it proved impossible he would not force it.

One could only say Shopkeeper Meng had been too careless and had accidentally lost this Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure.

Sitting cross-legged, Yang Kai drew out a block of fire-red jade core from the Black Book Space and stared at it, his expression somewhat hesitant.

The jade core was not very large, only the size of a fist; its shape was odd, roughly humanoid, and one could clearly see the facial features and limbs forming on the jade.

This jade core had been taken from the Yang Crystal Jade Bed that he had obtained from Lü Si.

When Yang Kai had been a guest of the Lü family, he had traded a letter written to Xiao Fusheng in exchange for Lü Si's meditation Yang Crystal Jade Bed.

After absorbing all the energy contained in the Yang Crystal Jade Bed, what remained was this jade core.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian had both said that a True Spirit had already taken root in that jade; give it a few hundred years and it might break the jade and truly become a living being.

A True Spirit within jade is but a legendary existence — once fully grown each True Spirit possesses unparalleled combat power.

It is an existence that even Transcendent Realm experts would dare not face!

Tang Yuxian had cautioned Yang Kai not to covet the True Spirit in the jade, because it was extremely dangerous.

But now, after hearing Shui Ling describe the grandeur of the outside world, Yang Kai could not help but be tempted by the jade True Spirit.

Although he possessed the Sixth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, his realm was not high enough. That other world had many Transcendent Realm experts and even Saint Realm masters; to survive in such unfamiliar lands, Yang Kai needed the means to protect himself.

Yang Kai did not imagine he could rise to the Transcendent Realm through the jade True Spirit — that would be unrealistic. At the least, before departing he wished to become stronger so he could face unknown dangers with more composure.

After hesitating for some time, Yang Kai's expression suddenly hardened.

Time waits for no one; he had to grow stronger quickly to set foot upon the road to the foreign lands.

Looking at the jade core in his hands, he decided to risk everything.

Fortune favors the bold; with the Heavenly Journey Palace guarding him, even if he failed he could escape.

Grasping the jade core with both hands, Yang Kai circulated the True Yang Technique. The tremendous suction peeled away the surface yang-origin energy of the jade core.

A ceaseless torrent of energy poured into Yang Kai's body. Even though the jade core seemed small, the energy stored within it was astonishingly immense.

Yang Kai's expression shifted as he carefully perceived it: yang-origin energy flowed into his meridians, which quickly became saturated.

Tick—tick—

A drop of Yang Liquid formed and fell into his Dantian to be stored.

Tick, tick—

One sound after another emanated from the depths of his mind in succession.

Yang Kai accepted it like honey, though his complexion changed slightly.

The energy within the jade core exceeded his expectations.

After absorbing for half a day, two hundred or more drops of Yang Liquid accumulated in his Dantian; only then was the outer layer of that small jade core stripped away.

A scorching, searing heat suddenly surged through his hands, and at the same time a terrifying, destructive aura descended. Yang Kai's face changed as he glanced down and saw the jade core had liquefied, flowing through the cracks between his fingers.

Sizzling—

Both of Yang Kai's hands were shredded and bloodied; such ferocious heat even he could not endure.

Without hesitation, he stepped back.

Haa—

When the flowing liquid hit the ground, a massive burst of fire exploded, and the oppressive heat swept outward; for a moment Yang Kai's vision was affected.

After steadying his mind, Yang Kai's expression grew grave.

In the place where he had been sitting, there now stood a blazing, orange, human-shaped flame burning fiercely.
