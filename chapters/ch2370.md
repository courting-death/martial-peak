## Chapter 2370 — Advanced Purification Array

There are only a handful of Emperors on Tongtian Island, so Ling Yinqin never imagined that the person she happened to meet on the road would actually have the potential to break through to the Emperor Realm.

If this Yang Kai really breaks through to the Emperor Realm, he will surely secure a place for himself on Tongtian Island, and might even be able to protect everyone on this boat. But... only those who have lived long in the Jixu Secret Realm know that this place is practically a graveyard for martial artists. Those who reside here are lucky if their cultivation doesn’t regress over time. Even if one is fortunate enough to sense an opportunity for breakthrough, very few ever succeed.

Ling Yinqin had seen far too many people fail their breakthroughs in this cursed place, losing all their cultivation and becoming cripples.

So after her initial shock, Ling Yinqin’s gaze toward Yang Kai became sympathetic. She could tell Yang Kai wasn’t very old, and having reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm proved his talent was exceptional. Outside, he would surely be a rising star of some Sect, a promising youth. Given time, he might even glimpse the mysteries of the Emperor Realm.

But here... the chances of failure are extremely high.

Yang Kai looked anxious, not understanding why Ling Yinqin was gazing at him with such sympathy. Seeing her remain silent, he pressed again, “Big Sister Ling, do you have any good ideas?”

“You really want to break through?” Ling Yinqin hesitated, then suggested, “If you’re not absolutely confident, I advise you to sever your cultivation rather than attempt a breakthrough in the Jixu Secret Realm!”

Yang Kai was stunned and instinctively asked, “Why?”

Jiao Yi said, “Brother Yang, the Jixu Secret Realm isn’t a suitable place for breakthroughs. You know this world is filled with endless transforming force. Ninety-nine out of a hundred who try here fail. Big Sister is thinking of your well-being.”

Now Yang Kai was truly shocked. He’d already suspected this wasn’t a good place for a breakthrough, but hadn’t realized it was so dire. Right now, Zhang Ruoxi’s energy was surging uncontrollably. If, as Ling Yinqin said, she severed her cultivation, Zhang Ruoxi would never advance to the Dao Origin Realm and would remain at the Void King Realm for life.

For this was to sever one’s path on the Martial Dao—no miraculous Spiritual Pill or wondrous medicine could ever restore it.

The other crew members also looked at Yang Kai with sympathy, as if he’d suffered great misfortune. No one minded anymore that he’d barged into Ling Yinqin’s room. To hold a grudge over such trivial matters against someone whose Martial Dao was about to end would be too cruel.

Yang Kai only hesitated briefly before his expression grew resolute. “Big Sister Ling, please advise me.”

Seeing his determination, Ling Yinqin knew persuasion was useless and said, “I have an advanced Purification Array. Perhaps it can help you.”

The Purification Array comes in four grades: low, middle, high, and top.

In recent days, chatting with Jiao Yi, Yang Kai learned that the arrays set up in the rooms on this boat were all low-grade. The higher the grade, the more expensive the array—each step up costs nearly ten times more. Ling Yinqin and her group are among the lowest-tier martial artists in the Jixu Secret Realm, with no resources to commission stronger arrays.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected her to possess an advanced Purification Array.

The higher the grade, the better the effect for martial artists. The Purification Array acts like a net, filtering out the transforming force in the world, but also impeding the flow of Spiritual Qi. So, no matter how rich the Spiritual Qi is in this world, wherever a Purification Array is set up, the Qi is relatively thin. The higher the grade, the less it blocks the Qi, and the denser the Qi becomes. Cultivating within it yields better results.

Yang Kai was overjoyed and quickly said, “Thank you, Big Sister Ling.”

Hearing that Ling Yinqin was willing to hand over her advanced Purification Array, the crew members all changed color. Jiao Yi even called out, “Big Sister, that Purification Array…”

Ling Yinqin interrupted him, took out a set of Formation Foundations from her Spatial Ring, and handed it to Yang Kai. “If things become impossible, don’t force it.”

She also gave Yang Kai a jade slip, saying, “This is the method for setting up the array. It’s simple—just study it carefully.”

“I’ve memorized it.” Yang Kai nodded solemnly. He didn’t know the origin of this advanced Purification Array, but seeing the crew’s expressions, he understood how precious it was to Ling Yinqin. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have kept it hidden.

As far as Yang Kai knew, even Ling Yinqin’s own room only had a low-grade Purification Array.

He didn’t know the story behind this advanced array, but secretly resolved to repay Ling Yinqin once things were settled.

“I have to trouble you again, Big Sister Ling. Is there any island nearby?” Yang Kai asked.

Ling Yinqin looked up and called to a bearded martial artist, “Bring the sea chart.”

The martial artist immediately took out a beast-skin map from his Spatial Ring and spread it out before Ling Yinqin with a rustle. Yang Kai leaned in to look, but couldn’t make much sense of it.

Ling Yinqin scanned the map for a while, then pointed to a spot and said, “Southeast, five hundred li, there’s a small island.”

Yang Kai cupped his fists. “Thank you!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his figure flickered and he vanished.

Everyone was startled, even Ling Yinqin’s expression changed. No one understood how Yang Kai had left.

She’d known Yang Kai was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but hadn’t expected his strength to be so formidable. Just now, with that miraculous disappearing technique, Ling Yinqin couldn’t even glimpse his trace. If someone like him wanted to kill her, she’d have no way to defend herself.

For a moment, Ling Yinqin was secretly glad she hadn’t let the crew provoke Yang Kai; otherwise, none of them would know how they died.

“Senior Brother… is he really going to break through to the Emperor Realm?” someone nearby murmured.

Ling Yinqin looked up and saw Liu Qianyun standing there, face full of worry.

She rushed out after Yang Kai, having heard the whole conversation clearly, and was naturally shaken. Unlike Ling Yinqin, who didn’t know Yang Kai well, Liu Qianyun had been meditating and cultivating with him these days, and hadn’t sensed any sign of a breakthrough. How could he suddenly be attempting to reach Emperor?

But after the shock came deep concern, because Ling Yinqin had made it clear—breaking through in the Jixu Secret Realm is a terrible idea.

“Big Sister Ling, my Senior Brother…” Liu Qianyun looked at Ling Yinqin.

Ling Yinqin sighed and said honestly, “The chances are very slim. It’s almost impossible.”

Liu Qianyun’s face turned pale, nearly unable to stand. For someone as brilliant as Yang Kai to fall in this cursed place? And it was all her fault. If not for their chance meeting in Gao City, Yang Kai wouldn’t have stood up for her, wouldn’t have provoked Yao Changjun, and wouldn’t have been chased into Jixu Ridge and swallowed by the Jixu Secret Realm.

The more Liu Qianyun thought about it, the more she felt she’d let Yang Kai down. If he failed and became a cripple or died, it would all be her responsibility.

“Big Sister, that Purification Array was left to you by Eldest Brother back then. Why are you…” Jiao Yi looked at Ling Yinqin with pain in his eyes.

Ling Yinqin said, “He needs it urgently. Lending it for a while is no big deal.”

Jiao Yi said, “But what if he damages it…”

“If any of you needed to break through, I’d lend it to you too.”

The crew knew Ling Yinqin wasn’t lying. That was her nature—cold outside, warm inside. Yang Kai was just a passenger, with no connection to her, yet she still lent him the precious Purification Array.

But its true value wasn’t in its price, but in what it meant to Ling Yinqin. So even though everyone knew she had an advanced array, no one ever asked her to use it for them. They all just huddled in their low-grade arrays, slowly cultivating and trying to slow their regression.

“Spread the word. We’ll wait here for a few days. You all go about your business.” Ling Yinqin waved her hand, issuing a dismissal.

The dozen or so crew members glanced at each other, then quietly left.

“Senior Brother Jiao, that Eldest Brother you mentioned… who was he?” Liu Qianyun asked as she walked with Jiao Yi toward the cabins.

Jiao Yi replied, “He was Big Sister Ling’s companion. Back then, she and Eldest Brother both fell into hardship here and led us as we struggled to survive. Later, during one voyage, Eldest Brother was killed by a sea beast while protecting everyone. The only thing he left behind was that Purification Array—he’d sold his own Secret Treasure to buy it. If he’d still had a weapon at hand, Eldest Brother might not have died.”

Speaking of the past, Jiao Yi grew emotional, clenching his fists. Clearly, he’d received much care from Eldest Brother and already regarded him as family.

“Eldest Brother was really good to Big Sister Ling.” Liu Qianyun said softly. For his partner, he’d rather sell his own Secret Treasure to buy a Purification Array. It seemed foolish, but who could judge?

“Now you should understand how precious that Purification Array is to Big Sister,” Jiao Yi said through gritted teeth. “If your Senior Brother damages it, I’ll be the first to hold him accountable!”

Although Jiao Yi had gotten along well with Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun these days, and even received many Source Crystals from Yang Kai, when it came to the advanced Purification Array, he firmly stood by Ling Yinqin.

After venting, Jiao Yi felt a bit regretful. “Sorry, I’ve got a bad temper. I shouldn’t have said all that. But who knows if your Senior Brother will come back safely.”

“It’s fine, I understand, Senior Brother Jiao.” Liu Qianyun waved her hand. She couldn’t help but imagine—if Yang Kai left her something, no matter how valuable, she’d treasure it as a keepsake.
