## Chapter 1954 — Snow Like Clear Sky

Accidentally obtaining an extraordinary treasure like the Ice Flower, Yang Kai was in high spirits.

The thing was indeed useless to him, but it could be exchanged for a large amount of cultivation resources, especially the Source Crystals he was currently short on.

If he could find a decent auction house to put those three Ice Fruit up for auction, Yang Kai reckoned he would not have to worry about Source Crystals for quite some time.

The bottom of the cliff was no place to linger, so after obtaining the Ice Flower, Yang Kai prepared to withdraw.

But at that instant a sharp, uncanny hiss suddenly sounded at his ear; no sooner had it echoed than a ribbon-like snow-white radiance shot forth from nearby, roaring like thunder, its momentum fierce and cutting.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes; an immense sense of crisis rose in his heart, and in an instant he flashed away from his original spot.

Hiss…

The snow-white radiance struck the void, gouging the earth into a vast trench; ice and rock burst into the air, its terrifying might enough to alarm anyone who witnessed it.

"Who!" Yang Kai instinctively thought someone was hiding at the bottom of the Ice Cliff to ambush him, because that sudden move gave him the feeling of a Sword Dao secret technique, and that snow-white light was clearly a sword radiance suffused with an ice-cold profound intent!

But as soon as the thought formed he felt something was off: this was the bottom of the Ice Cliff, and he had used the Nothingness secret technique to cheat his way in—if there really was someone hiding here, how terrifyingly powerful would that person have to be?

Such an expert would not need to ambush him to deal with him, would they?

So he hurriedly looked toward the source of the attack.

At the sight, he was instantly taken aback.

Another snow-white sword radiance charged forward, wrapped in a bone-chilling profound intent. The Power of the Laws burst out in all directions, splashing the void, unstoppable!

Impossible to resist! Yang Kai made that judgment in an instant, and once more used teleportation to flash away from the spot.

At the bottom of this cliff he had to constantly watch for the suppression of Imperial Might and the ice-cold profound intent, and maintain his Nothingness secret technique; otherwise he could be crushed to death. Now that such a violent attack had suddenly appeared, Yang Kai truly felt flustered.

After avoiding the other's second strike, Yang Kai at last snatched a moment to carefully look toward the source of the attack.

When he clearly saw what had been attacking him, Yang Kai's eyeballs nearly popped out; his heart trembled wildly and he cried out in astonishment, "How is this possible?"

It was not a person ambushing him, but a creature in the likeness of a yao insect. That yao insect looked like a dung beetle, with a thick shell on its back. It should have been bluish-green, but perhaps because it had spent too long at the bottom of the cliff, its whole body had taken on a crystalline snow-white.

"A Spirit-Eating Yao Worm? No way!" Yang Kai could hardly believe his eyes.

Spirit-Eating Yao Worms were not a specialty of the Star Realm. They also existed in the Star Domain, so Yang Kai recognized this odd beast. Spirit-Eating Yao Worms ate anything; as long as something had any Spiritual Qi, it could become their food.

Secret Treasures, armor, a warrior's flesh, Saint Crystals... and so on, and their gnawing ignored defenses; they could even devour ancient forbidden formations of tremendous power.

In the Star Realm there was an old tale: on some Cultivation Star there stood an ancient sealed ground imprisoning a ferocious existence. A swarm of Spirit‑Eating Yao Worms bored into the seal’s power, gnawing it away until that cruel being was loosed, plunging the star into carnage and bathing it in blood — countless lives wiped out in the aftermath.

Of course, it was only a legend, impossible to verify, but where there was smoke there was fire—the trouble caused by Spirit-Eating Yao Worms was evident.

Fortunately these things grew extremely slowly and warriors all knew how dangerous they were, so once discovered they were exterminated with all-out effort.

Yang Kai had also seen Spirit-Eating Yao Worms before, so he recognized it at a glance.

But the ones he'd seen were only the size of a cluster of caterpillars and could not harm warriors.

Yet the snow-white Spirit-Eating Yao Worm before him was as tall as two men, looking mighty and imposing; merely its fierce appearance put huge pressure on Yang Kai.

"A Yao Worm Matriarch?" Yang Kai's face darkened.

Spirit-Eating Yao Worms were not all tiny; their structure was somewhat like ants: among a swarm there could be a matriarch, and all the Spirit-Eating Yao Worms obeyed the matriarch's command.

The one before him was definitely a Yao Worm Matriarch!

Most ridiculously, the front section of this snow-white matriarch's body had two large pincers, and on one of those pincers an energy-forged longsword had condensed, flashing a faint white light.

Yang Kai was nearly dumbstruck.

That such a giant Yao Worm Matriarch should suddenly appear at the bottom of the Ice Cliff was already incredible, and on top of that the matriarch could condense an energy longsword.

What was going on?

And those two identical moves just now that resembled Sword Dao secret techniques were clearly slashes from that matriarch.

Even Yang Kai, who had weathered countless storms and had plenty of experience, felt his mind go blank for a moment. What he saw utterly upended his common sense and shattered his understanding, leaving him unable to come up with any reasonable explanation.

Spirit-Eating Yao Worms had very low intelligence; even after growing for tens of thousands of years they couldn't evolve to the point of understanding how to perform Sword Dao secret techniques.

Yet judging from the profound intent contained within those two sword radiances, its attainment in Sword Dao was not low! Those two sword strikes absolutely had the bearing of a master.

One more thing puzzled Yang Kai—he had a faint sense that those two swords, or rather that Sword Dao secret technique, looked somewhat familiar.

While he was lost in thought, the Yao Worm Matriarch once again raised the energy longsword on its pincer high; its two small eyes gleamed with cold white light, gazing at Yang Kai with a human-like contempt, and then the surrounding ice-cold and the Laws coiled about that energy longsword.

White light suddenly appeared, sword radiance burst forth across the void, slashing through the void like a swimming dragon racing!

Before it reached him, Yang Kai's breath hitched; the place where he stood felt frozen, space congealed.

This was sword intent, an utmost and bitterly cold sword intent! The energy roaming the heavens and earth had condensed into fine ice-needles and wildly shot toward Yang Kai.

Snow suddenly fell.

Yang Kai cried out in alarm, "Snow Like Clear Sky!"

A shock reverberated deep within him; he had never expected to see that Sword Dao secret technique in the Star Realm. He knew well how powerful this technique was, so he didn't dare hesitate: pushing with both hands, countless Moon Blades surged forth.

Boom, boom, boom……

The cold profound intent and the power of space collided, producing a tremendous sound that shook the entire Ice Cliff; although Yang Kai's research into spatial secret techniques had reached a degree ordinary people could not approach, he was after all only a Third Stage of the Void King Realm warrior, and the harsh environment at the bottom of the Ice Cliff greatly augmented the Yao Worm Matriarch's Sword Dao secret technique.

So when the two secret techniques collided, the Moon Blades shattered with a roar; they were simply no match for the sword radiance.

The ice-cold, dazzling sword radiance tore through Yang Kai's resistance, striking his face.

Yang Kai's breath stalled; he hastily operated the Nothingness secret technique, merging himself with the void.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh……

Countless ice-needles and enormous sword radiances passed through the place where Yang Kai stood, directly breaking open his Nothingness.

Yang Kai's transparent body reappeared; although by fusing himself with the void he avoided most of the attacks, the ice-cold profound intent could not be completely resisted.

Yang Kai, appearing again, was chilled all over, his face purple; before he could rally to deal with the matriarch, the surrounding Imperial Might and ice-cold Laws already pressed down.

Panic-stricken, Yang Kai hurriedly once again used Nothingness to evade that violent killing intent.

He could not stay here; to continue remaining would be a road to certain death!

Yang Kai made a decision; the moment his body became Nothingness, he frantically urged his power, one teleport after another, rushing upward, wanting to escape this cursed place.

Even without looking back, Yang Kai knew the matriarch was closely following, because behind him sword radiances flew; had he not been proficient in spatial secret techniques, he would have been either frozen into an ice statue or cut down on the spot.

"This is impossible, this makes no sense!" Yang Kai shot upward while dodging attacks from behind, his face full of incomprehension.

The reason was nothing else: it was the Sword Dao secret technique the matriarch had used that left him bewildered.

After several observations of that secret technique, Yang Kai finally confirmed that he had indeed seen that move before.

"Snow Like Clear Sky!"

It was clearly the secret technique Su Yan had once shown in front of him.

In those days at the Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai occasionally practiced a couple moves with Su Yan; he had seen Su Yan perform Snow Like Clear Sky more than once, so the technique had left a deep impression on him.

After coming to the Star Realm, to see that technique again in the hands of a Spirit-Eating Yao Worm Matriarch—how could Yang Kai not be astonished?

That the matriarch could perform a secret technique was shocking enough, yet it was a technique Su Yan had mastered; if not for the pain that rose from his chest, Yang Kai would have thought he was dreaming.

However, on the other hand, the matriarch's grasp and comprehension of Snow Like Clear Sky was by no means comparable to Su Yan's.

After all Su Yan at the time was First Stage of the Void King Realm, and that secret technique was something she had learned in Chi Lan Star's Ice Heart Valley.

The same secret technique appearing in two different places could only be explained by someone passing it on in the middle—who was the one pulling the strings?

Had the technique flowed down from the Star Realm or been transmitted up from the Star Domain?

Many thoughts flashed through Yang Kai's mind, yet he still could not come up with a reasonable explanation.

But soon he recalled something: Su Yan had once said that everything she learned in Ice Heart Valley had been created by Ice Heart Valley's founding ancestor Bing Yun, and even the Profound Frost Divine Sword Su Yan had brought out from Ice Heart Valley had been Bing Yun's sword in former years.

Dusted-off memories were opened; Yang Kai vaguely remembered that back on Chi Lan Star's Ice Heart Valley, Sect Master Bing Long had once said that the founding ancestor Bing Yun might very well not have died, because in the forbidden Cold Pool there was only Bing Yun's sword Profound Frost, and no Void Mind Crystal of Bing Yun.

Could it be...

Had the founding ancestor Bing Yun of Ice Heart Valley also come to the Star Realm?
