## Chapter 2524 — The Vastness of Heaven and Earth

The Myriad Beasts Seal was a rare and wondrous artifact, capable of sealing away the spirit essences of demonic beasts. When unleashed in battle, these sealed spirit essences would fight at the wielder’s command, each retaining most of the formidable abilities they possessed in life. The more spirit essences the seal contained, the greater its power became—its might growing with every beast bound within.

Ever since Zu Hong advanced to the Emperor Realm, he had been hunting demonic beasts all over the Eastern Territory. Now, the Myriad Beasts Seal contained no fewer than eight hundred, if not a thousand, demonic beast spirit essences—almost all Eleventh-Tier, with more than a dozen powerful Twelfth-Tier demonic beasts as the core spirits.

And this was not even the Myriad Beasts Seal’s most powerful form. At its peak, it could seal the spirit essences of a full ten thousand demonic beasts.

If he truly went all out, an ordinary First Stage Emperor Realm cultivator would not be his match at all.

It was precisely by relying on the Myriad Beasts Seal that Zu Hong was able to unify Kunyuan City and become its exalted City Lord.

However, he was injured earlier. Although he had meditated for a while, he had not recovered to his peak, so at this moment, he could not unleash the full power of the Myriad Beasts Seal. All the demonic beast spirit essences he released were Eleventh-Tier.

But that was already enough. As long as he could slightly delay Yang Kai’s movements and create an opening, he believed Ju Tianqing would let this brat know the consequences of offending an expert.

Earlier, when he and Ju Tianqing joined forces against Gao Xueting, this was exactly how they acted, so he was quite practiced at it.

Rumble...

A never-ending tide of demonic beasts bared their fangs and roared at Yang Kai. There were those that flew in the sky and those that ran on the ground—every kind imaginable. In an instant, they gathered into a demonic beast army, their might terrifying.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up at the sight, immediately realizing that the Myriad Beasts Seal was an extraordinary secret treasure.

Yet, although the demonic beast army was fierce, he remained unafraid. With a shake of his hand, the Myriad Sword slid smoothly from its sheath. With a sweep and a slash, a ribbon of sword light swept out, slashing straight toward the demonic beast army.

“Those are all demonic beast spirit essences, they have no physical form. Ordinary attacks are useless against them... Watch out for sneak attacks!” Suddenly, Gao Xueting’s voice transmitted to his ear.

Though she was hiding within the barrier to heal her wounds and could not move freely, it did not stop her from observing the battle as a spectator.

When Yang Kai had suddenly appeared earlier, she was both shocked and anxious.

Shocked to encounter Yang Kai in such a place, and anxious as to why he would come to this wretched place.

No matter his talent, he was still young. Even with heaven-defying abilities, he could not possibly be a match for Ju Tianqing and Zu Hong. She had suffered greatly at their hands and knew their strength well. If even she was not their match, how could Yang Kai resist?

Perhaps, given time, Yang Kai’s achievements would surpass the two of them. But definitely not now.

Her first thought was to urge Yang Kai to flee at once.

But on second thought, Yang Kai’s appearance here was probably for her sake. She did not know how he learned she was trapped here—otherwise, how could there be such a coincidence in this world?

Now that he was already here, even if she told him to escape, he likely would not leave.

When she sensed that Yang Kai had reached the Emperor Realm, Gao Xueting was deeply shocked.

She still remembered the first time she met Yang Kai. Back then, he was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and together with Qin Chaoyang, he had brought the Mortal Token to Qingyang Shrine, seeking a spot to enter the Four Seasons Land. In just a few short years, he had already reached the Emperor Realm, matching her own cultivation.

Such cultivation speed—if not unprecedented, was certainly rare in history.

Her own talent was considered outstanding; otherwise, she would not have glimpsed the mysteries of the Emperor Realm. But how long had it taken her to advance from the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm to the Emperor Realm? Fifty years? A hundred years?

It had been so long, she had forgotten.

Even her own lord, Hall Master Wen Zishan, could not compare. The so-called geniuses of the Sect were like fireflies competing with the bright moon compared to Yang Kai’s cultivation speed.

What kind of opportunity had he obtained in the Shattered Star Sea to grow to such a level?

As Gao Xueting cried out, Ju Tianqing took advantage of Yang Kai’s distraction with the Myriad Beasts Seal and flew above his head, slashing down with his blade. The Starfire Sea-Cleaving Blade erupted with a sky full of stars, enveloping Yang Kai completely.

Suddenly, Yang Kai felt as if he were adrift in a boundless sea of stars, a sense of his own insignificance overwhelming him.

This momentary disturbance to his divine soul caused Yang Kai’s movements to pause slightly. By the time he reacted, the violent blade light was already upon his chest.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, a trace of panic and fear flashing in his clear gaze, and he was struck head-on by the blade light.

In the next instant, the demonic beast army surged forward, thundering over the spot where Yang Kai stood. Before their overwhelming might, Yang Kai was torn to pieces, his body shattered before their eyes.

“Ah!” Gao Xueting cried out, her pretty face turning instantly pale.

Though she had thought Yang Kai could not possibly be a match for Ju Tianqing and Zu Hong, she had not expected him to die so quickly. Her delicate body trembled uncontrollably, unable to accept this reality. Guilt and fury surged within her, making her beautiful eyes instantly bloodshot.

Yang Kai had come here for her sake—of that, Gao Xueting was certain. Yet now, because of her, he had lost his life in this place. How could she not be wracked with guilt?

Judging by Yang Kai’s previous cultivation speed and heaven-defying talent, given a little time, he would surely shine brilliantly in the Star Realm, becoming a rising star renowned throughout the land.

But now, all of that was gone.

A young man with a bright future and boundless prospects had died here because of her. He had not even had the chance to truly experience the might of the Emperor Realm.

“Hmph, overestimating himself!” Ju Tianqing sheathed his blade, standing proudly in the void, and sneered coldly.

“What was that? All thunder and no rain. This City Lord thought that brat was something special, but he turned out to be nothing but a fancy pillow.” Zu Hong also laughed. If he had known the brat was so weak, he would not have needed to act at all—Ju Tianqing alone could have crushed him. All the effort he spent recovering his strength was wasted.

“Young people these days really don’t know the vastness of heaven and earth. A little achievement and they become blindly arrogant, not realizing there is always a higher sky and stronger people.”

“Brother Ju is right. People like that need to be taught a lesson.” Zu Hong nodded in agreement.

“You two are quite right. Why don’t you tell me, then—just how high is this heaven, and just how deep is this earth?” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly rang out again, this time coming directly from behind Zu Hong.

“Brother Zu, watch out!” Ju Tianqing’s face changed dramatically as he cried out in alarm, his eyes nearly tearing at the corners.

Because he saw that Yang Kai, who should have been torn to pieces by their combined attack, was now standing unharmed behind Zu Hong. The broad sword in his hand, radiating the aura of an Imperial Treasure, was aimed with deadly intent at Zu Hong’s back, and Zu Hong was completely unaware.

Zu Hong was so frightened his soul nearly left his body. With his powerful Emperor Realm cultivation, he had not even noticed how Yang Kai appeared behind him. In disbelief, he glanced at where Yang Kai had been, only to see that the shredded Yang Kai was just a remnant afterimage.

Damn! Zu Hong’s heart sank. There was no time to dodge or turn around. As he shouted, he frantically mobilized his Emperor Yuan, a bright light flaring around him.

Especially on his back, the light was dazzling—he had pushed his protective Emperor Yuan to the limit.

In the next moment, a violent impact struck. Zu Hong felt his internal organs tremble painfully, and an unstoppable force blasted a hole in his protective Emperor Yuan, striking his back.

With a cry, Zu Hong spat blood. Using the force of the blow, he staggered forward, putting distance between himself and Yang Kai.

“A treasure armor?” Yang Kai raised his brow, staring at the spot he had struck. Through the torn clothing, he saw a pale blue scale armor.

This treasure armor was of high grade. Combined with Zu Hong’s powerful cultivation, it had prevented Yang Kai’s sneak attack from achieving its full effect.

“You dare sneak attack this City Lord, brat!” Zu Hong turned, eyes blazing with fury, and growled at Yang Kai, his face pale.

If he had not been wearing the treasure armor, even if he had not died, he would have been seriously injured. He was filled with lingering fear. How could this brat, who had just advanced to the Emperor Realm, possess such strength? That cicada-shedding–like secret technique had actually fooled both himself and Ju Tianqing at the same time.

“Brother Zu, you support from the side. This Lord will teach him a lesson.” Seeing Zu Hong injured and unsteady, Ju Tianqing did not force him to join in, but had him support from the side. With a shout, the Starfire Sea-Cleaving Blade swept up layers of blade light, surging toward Yang Kai like waves.

Zu Hong nodded heavily, his rage erupting like a volcano. He silently channeled the power of the Myriad Beasts Seal, sending the demonic beast spirit essences charging at Yang Kai again.

To be sneak attacked by a newly advanced Emperor—this was a humiliation beyond compare. If he did not avenge this, how could he face anyone?

The two Emperors joined forces, their might overwhelming, like gods enraged.

The heart that Gao Xueting had just managed to calm was once again in her throat.

Yang Kai’s sudden resurrection had delighted her, making her realize that she, Ju Tianqing, and Zu Hong had all underestimated him. But now, facing two opponents at once, how could he possibly hold out?

Gritting her teeth, Gao Xueting flipped her fair hand and took out a jade bottle from her spatial ring. She uncorked it and poured out a blood-red spiritual pill filled with a metallic scent.

Her beautiful eyes hesitated for a moment, but she raised her hand, about to put the pill in her mouth.

“Elder Gao, don’t!”

At that moment, Yang Kai’s urgent shout rang out.

Gao Xueting was stunned. She looked up at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes full of suspicion.

“You’re already injured. If you take that Blood Frenzy Pill to forcibly stimulate your potential, you’ll damage your foundation. Absolutely do not take it! And that Blood Frenzy Pill is of such poor quality—taking it will bring huge hidden dangers. Which bastard alchemist made that for you? Completely irresponsible!”

Looking around, Yang Kai was battered and struggling under the combined assault of the two Emperors, but his clear voice still reached Gao Xueting’s ears, astonishing her. She could not understand how he still had the presence of mind to worry about her.
