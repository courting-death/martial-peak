## Chapter 2041 — Wood Seed

Yang Kai, lying in wait at the side, had long anticipated this moment; when the chance arrived he would not let Mu Xiao slip away.

With the aid of spatial secret arts he appeared directly before Mu Xiao. His gaze was cold as he stared at it; his hands opened and closed, and a vast Moon Blade leisurely took shape.

Just as Yang Kai was about to unleash the Moon Blade for the finishing strike, Mu Xiao uttered a sharp cry — and with that a sudden stab of pain shot through Yang Kai’s arm. His wrist twitched, and the Moon Blade surged forth.

A sharp hiss filled the air as the massive Moon Blade sang; though it was condensed from spatial power and not specifically the Mu Xiao's bane, its might was undeniable. Yang Kai lost his aim at the last moment and failed to strike the creature's vital point, yet the blade still sliced clean through its body.

The wound gaped neat and even as emerald-green fluid poured forth, spraying out like a magnificent fountain.

Liu Yan seized the chance and pounced, transforming into a blaze that wrapped Mu Xiao completely.

Nearby the Yao Worm Matriarch held the purple-green twin swords and assumed a strange posture; light flashed along both blades, and with a twist of its body a tremendous sword radiance flew out, cleaving into the fray around Liu Yan and Mu Xiao.

In an instant Mu Xiao emitted a sharp, hissing cry.

Meanwhile Yang Kai's face turned deathly pale as he retreated dozens of zhang, tore off his clothes, and stared at his right arm. The next moment he shouted hoarsely, "Wood seed!"

At that moment, embedded in the skin and flesh of his right arm was a pale cyan speck the size of a grain of rice. As it pulsed his Qi and blood surged toward it as if uncontrolled, and it ravenously devoured them.

With the influx of Qi and blood the little thing even showed signs of breaking its shell.

Yang Kai immediately understood what it was: it was evidently Mu Xiao's wood seed, the faint flash of light that had vanished earlier.

No wonder even the six great Emperor Realm masters could not completely eradicate Mu Xiao; the wood seed hid so covertly that his two previous careful searches of his body had failed to find it. Had Mu Xiao not tried just now to obstruct him and flee, the wood seed probably would not have been activated.

It was precisely the activation of the wood seed that had caused Yang Kai's Moon Blade to lose its aim.

Yang Kai knew all too well the fate of the cultivators in Fenglin City who had been parasitized by wood seeds. In a very short time a cultivator's flesh would be consumed clean, turning them into a mindless Mu Xiao duplicate.

Yang Kai had no intention of sharing those people's fate.

Watching the wood seed gulp down ever more Qi and blood, Yang Kai gritted his teeth. A fine Space Blade condensed on his finger; he pinched the spot where the wood seed sat. With a muffled roar he tore that piece of flesh off.

In an instant his arm was dripping blood.

The clump of flesh he had ripped free, no longer under his control, was devoured by the wood seed in moments. The seed transformed into a seedling, from which thin vines shot out, attempting to re-enter Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, immediately invoked the Xuan Realm Pearl, and with a flick of his body entered the Small Xuan Realm.

Within the Small Xuan Realm Yang Kai seized the Mu Xiao seedling; flame suddenly burned in his palm, completely enveloping it.

With a piercing cry the not-yet-formed Mu Xiao duplicate was burned to ash.

After that, Yang Kai took a healing pill from a Spatial Ring and swallowed it, sat cross-legged, and used the power of the Laws within the Small Xuan Realm to carefully examine every inch of his flesh.

He was truly frightened of the wood seed.

With his Divine Sense alone he could not detect a hidden wood seed, but inside the Small Xuan Realm it was different; he could use that realm's heavenly laws. Such an inspection was far more thorough than probing with Divine Sense alone and could truly eliminate the danger.

After the search Yang Kai finally confirmed that aside from the earlier wood seed there were no others on his body, and only then did he relax.

After that period of recovery the wound on Yang Kai's arm was nearly fully healed. His Golden Blood already had powerful healing ability, and combined with his robust constitution, such an injury was nothing.

After breathing a sigh of relief Yang Kai shifted and left the Small Xuan Realm.

Returning once more to the plain, Yang Kai glanced about and found the place utterly tranquil, without the slightest sign of struggle.

Nearby Liu Yan, who had already taken human form, lightly sprang to Yang Kai's side. Her perpetually cool, lovely face at last revealed a faint smile as she called, "Master."

Yang Kai nodded, glanced at the ashes, and asked, "Is it dead?"

Liu Yan inclined her head and replied, "Killed it!"

Speaking, she turned to regard the Yao Worm Matriarch and said lightly, "The new helper you found is quite strong—much stronger than me."

Yang Kai glanced at her as if he had noticed something, and smiled, "It is good, but it has great growth limits; the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm is likely its peak. You are different—you have your own intelligence. Train well, and in time you will be stronger."

"Yes, Master." Liu Yan replied, lowering her head, though the corner of her mouth involuntarily lifted into a small curve.

Yang Kai beckoned to the Yao Worm Matriarch; it shot over at once and he drew it back into the Small Xuan Realm.

Looking around the wasteland was a scene of ruin. Within this half day two experts of the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm had died here, along with more than a dozen Void King Realm warriors, which caused Yang Kai some sighs.

"Search and see if any Spatial Rings were left behind," Yang Kai ordered, and then he and Liu Yan began searching.

Before long Yang Kai had seven or eight Spatial Rings on his person. These rings belonged to Fei Sheng Palace's cultivators; he did not inspect their contents closely, assuming there would be neither too much nor too little.

He had already secured the rings of Ning Yuancheng and Han Leng. As for Liu Yizhi's ring, whether it had been destroyed in the battle or taken elsewhere was unknown; in any case it could not be found, which left Yang Kai somewhat regretful.

After all, that was the ring of a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert; it surely contained many valuable items.

"Master, what shall we do with this?" Liu Yan asked, looking at the flying ship on the ground with curiosity in her beautiful eyes as she examined it.

She had parted from Yang Kai in the Starlight Passage and upon entering the Star Realm had not had time to enjoy many of its wonders; she knew little about this tower-ship, only that it was a flying Secret Treasure.

"Of course we'll take it." Yang Kai grinned, walked around the ship a few times, and displayed a satisfied expression.

He had firsthand experience of how fast it flew; he had once followed that ship and could not catch up no matter how hard he tried. In the later battle the ship's shield had even withstood attacks from the Flourishing Moon Great Formation, clearly showing its strong defenses.

This was unquestionably a Dao Origin-Grade flying Secret Treasure!

Yang Kai currently lacked a single flying Secret Treasure for transport; such a windfall would not be let go. Although it belonged to Fei Sheng Palace and using it later might link him to Ning Yuancheng's death if seen by malicious observers, as long as he was cautious and did not use it publicly there would be no problem.

The ship was too large for Yang Kai to instantly refine; he could only expend vast Divine Sense power to store it in the Xuan Realm Pearl and wait to handle it later.

"Let's go!" Yang Kai called to Liu Yan and prepared to return to Fenglin City. With Liu Yan's matter resolved he could accompany Kang Siran to explore that cave dwelling without worry.

But at that moment a gust of wind blew; Yang Kai, about to turn and leave, halted and looked suspiciously in a certain direction.

"What's wrong?" Liu Yan asked, startled.

Yang Kai did not answer but watched intently for a while, then suddenly shifted and went to the spot where the Mu Xiao duplicate had been killed.

There had originally been only the ashes of the burned Mu Xiao duplicate, but when the gale blew a glimmer of light flickered within the ashes, which caught Yang Kai's attention.

He crouched and brushed aside the ashes; Yang Kai immediately saw something.

He recoiled sharply, his face full of caution, and nearly let loose a Moon Blade.

Liu Yan approached gracefully and stood beside him; her eyes swept over the spot, and upon seeing the object in the ashes she murmured, "A seed?"

She glanced at Yang Kai; he nodded lightly, and Liu Yan stepped forward, inhaled, and pinched the seed between her fingertips.

It truly was a seed, only the size of a grain of rice, clearly something left after Mu Xiao had been burned.

To have survived Liu Yan's blazing flame, this seed was certainly no ordinary thing.

It was plainly Mu Xiao's wood seed!

Yang Kai's alarmed reaction was for that reason. He had suffered considerably earlier, even tearing a piece of his own flesh off to avert the crisis.

Once bitten by a snake, one would be wary of ropes for ten years.

Strangely, this wood seed differed greatly from the one planted in Yang Kai's arm; it was not cyan-green but divided into gold and silver halves—the left side glittered with golden light, the right side shone with silver—looking extremely odd.

"Is there something wrong?" Yang Kai asked warily.

Liu Yan inclined her head and said, "There is indeed a problem. This seed still contains a bit of peculiar soul-force; it seems it has not been completely extinguished."

"I knew it," Yang Kai ground his teeth.

If he hadn't been quick and dodged just then — if he'd reached out with his fingers to take that wood seed — he might have been parasitized again. And this seed was clearly no ordinary thing; when push came to shove it might not be something that could be solved by merely tearing away a piece of flesh.

Fortunately he had Liu Yan, Mu Xiao's bane, who was not afraid of its strange abilities.

"Very well, very well—this fellow actually dared to set a trap for me!" Yang Kai sneered, waved his hand, and said, "Come with me!"

As he spoke, power wrapped around Liu Yan and took her directly into the Small Xuan Realm.
