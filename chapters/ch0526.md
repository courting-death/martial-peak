## Chapter 526 — What If I Am Counted Too?

The arrival of these seven formidable figures instantly eased the tensions of Dong Qinghan and the others.

Facing the Divine Roaming and beyond alone, these young warriors were filled with dread and fear. But now, with seven powerful allies appearing, they felt they finally had support and a backbone to rely on.

Tang Yuxian also floated lightly by Tu Feng’s side.

Except for Ying Jiu, who was nowhere to be seen at the moment, the remaining eight gathered here. Facing eight opponents beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, they were unafraid and composed.

Eight against eight!

Though the numbers were equal, their strengths differed vastly.

On the opposing side, all eight were beyond the Divine Roaming Realm—Grand Elders from the Eight Great Families.

Yet among the eight Blood Servants, only four had reached the Divine Roaming Realm’s Ninth Stage, and the other four merely the Eighth Stage. The difference in power was enormous.

“Blood Fury Technique!” Upon arriving, Tu Feng and the others did not hesitate to unleash the Yang Family Blood Servants’ forbidden technique. Ferocious energy rippled out; a red glow flared on each face as their Qi and blood surged rapidly.

Yang Zhao’s estate and the onlookers were dumbfounded.

Seven Blood Servants using the Blood Fury Technique simultaneously—what a magnificent sight!

Blood Servants were by definition formidable beings, nearly invincible within their ranks. When fighting, they reserved forbidden techniques for special circumstances and wouldn’t use them lightly.

To witness even one Blood Servant unleash the Blood Fury Technique was a feast for the eyes; now, seven were doing so together.

The gathered momentum and energy shockwaves nearly threw the Spiritual Qi throughout War City into complete chaos.

The eight beyond Divine Roaming also shifted slightly, surprised they could reach such a level.

“Impudent!” Yang Liting roared with anger. “Do you even know your own position?”

“Grand Elder, please forgive!” Tu Feng’s face flushed red, Qi and blood surging wildly as he loudly replied, “Though you are the Yang Family’s Grand Elder and we are the Yang Family’s Blood Servants, the Elder Hall has ordered us to follow the Young Master. We are his men, and at this moment, naturally, we must protect him.”

“Do you consider his safety more important than the honor of the family?” Yang Liting narrowed his eyes, watching them coldly.

All eight Blood Servants nodded in unison. Tang Yuxian spoke, “Grand Elder, by order of the Elder Hall, we now serve only the Young Master. His safety naturally supersedes family honor. Should any misfortune befall him, we would bear the blame even unto death. If we offend you today, we ask for your tolerance.”

“Rebellion!” Yang Liting’s anger twisted into a bitter laugh, his face twitching slightly. With his status and power, none had ever dared oppose him openly—especially not the Yang Family’s Blood Servants, the family’s golden brand and epitome of loyalty. Yet today, these so-called left and right arms of the Yang Family defied him at all costs!

Especially under so many watchful eyes, Yang Liting felt his authority was being trampled.

“Foolish loyalty!” One of the Divine Roaming beyond elders who had earlier urged Yang Liting sneered, clearly contemptuous of the Blood Servants’ stubbornness. Though powerful and loyal, in certain circumstances, the Blood Servants could be stubborn and inflexible—like this instance before them.

“We harbor no ill intent, but if you intend to trouble the Young Master, we... will not consent!” Tu Feng fixed his gaze on the eight opponents and slowly shook his head.

“Even with your help, you have no right to stop me!” Yang Liting shouted in fury, clearly determined to purge his faction here and now.

“What if I am counted too?” A voice, ethereal and elusive, drifted from afar.

Hearing this, the eight beyond Divine Roaming immediately stiffened and concentrated their sight toward the sound’s source.

From the shadows emerged a figure, drifting like an immortal, walking slowly and leisurely, calm and poised.

He moved at no great speed, yet in just three steps stood before the crowd. Whether by intent or accident, he took a position in mid-air noticeably higher than the eight beyond Divine Roaming.

He stood firm, gazing down at the eight with a composed expression.

Yang Liting and the others grew solemn, eyes fixed tightly on Meng Wuya, brows gradually knitting.

Though this man was only a Divine Roaming Realm peak cultivator, they sensed something unusual. His few casual steps, seemingly random, perfectly aligned with the Dao and left no trace.

Such profundity was hard even for these Divine Roaming Elders of the Eight Great Families to comprehend.

How could a Divine Roaming peak cultivator have such deep insight into the martial Dao? They inwardly shuddered.

They knew of Meng Wuya’s presence—they knew he had been in War City a while—but their understanding never extended beyond his cultivation level.

They thought he was just an ordinary peak Divine Roaming cultivator.

But now they realized this Divine Roaming peak was no ordinary figure.

Facing him, even someone as strong as Yang Liting felt a deep sense of threat and pressure, as if in a one-on-one fight, he wouldn’t be the match.

“Also me!” came another voice.

This time, the eight’s hearts chilled.

They knew of Meng Wuya, but this new voice seemed to have appeared from nowhere. His aura was completely shrouded without the slightest leak. Had he not revealed himself, the eight would never have sensed him.

Only those beyond Divine Roaming could possess such concealment.

War City had been hiding a beyond Divine Roaming master all along.

If this individual wished to harm the young experts here, the consequences would be dire indeed, causing a cold sweat to break out on the eight’s brows.

Fortunately, he appeared harmless.

Turning their eyes, they saw an elderly man with white hair and beard, exuding the aura of a transcendent sage, strolling leisurely from another direction. Like Meng Wuya’s appearance, he captivated the crowd’s eyes and shocked their hearts.

What puzzled the eight slightly was that his steps also contained Dao mysteries similar to those of the first visitor, nearly identical.

The man stood dozens of zhang away, smiling gently at Meng Wuya. Shopkeeper Meng grimaced wryly, “I’ve long known you were in War City. Finally, you couldn’t hold back?”

The elder smiled apologetically, “Brother Meng, I appreciate all your efforts these past days. I was truly inconvenienced from showing myself.”

“I understand.” Meng Wuya nodded slightly.

“Also, thanks for discussing the Way of Martial Arts with me these past ten years. I have benefited greatly since ascending, and many mysteries previously beyond my grasp are now clear.”

“This is serious,” Meng Wuya replied lightly with a smile. “No need for formalities between us!”

Seeing the two treat heroes of the world as worthless, reunited after a long separation and speaking happily here, the Divine Roaming beyond the Eight Great Families’ faces darkened instantly.

They clearly felt they were being looked down upon.

Though angry, from the brief dialogue, they sensed something unusual.

These two must be old acquaintances, and the latter stranger seemed quite courteous to the one who appeared first.

How so? Shouldn’t the latter be weaker in cultivation? What qualifications did he have to discuss the martial Dao with the other, and even evoke such gratitude?

He appeared naturally confident without arrogance.

Everyone was confused.

“May I inquire your honorable names?” Qiu Daoren asked gravely.

Although certain the two meant no harm and only came to protect Yang Kai, they wished to know their identities given their immense strength.

Meng Wuya smiled faintly and replied calmly, “Shopkeeper of Lingxiao Pavilion’s Contribution Hall, Meng Wuya.”

This self-introduction made those unaware of Meng Wuya’s background cringe invisibly.

Just a shopkeeper—yet possessing such presence and cultivation? Was Lingxiao Pavilion truly a sect of hidden dragons and crouching tigers?

“And this gentleman?” Qiu Daoren inhaled deeply, looking at the other elder.

The elder nodded lightly, “Sect Leader of Lingxiao Pavilion, Ling Taixu.”

The expressions of the Eight Great Families’ powerhouses shifted drastically.

Ling Taixu, Sect Leader of Lingxiao Pavilion!

The only figure from a second-rate sect to achieve cultivation beyond Divine Roaming—a unique and unparalleled honor in the annals of this world.

Never before had a second-rate force produced a beyond Divine Roaming warrior. Even Lü Si of the Lü Family only ascended beyond Divine Roaming after the Lü Family became a first-rate family, aided by guidance and promotion from Qiu Family experts.

Ling Taixu’s name represented legend—a living myth.

Moreover, he had a disciple.

That disciple now ruled over the Cangyun Evil Land as its Evil Lord, controlling millions of li, commanding six great evil kings, and countless vile demons.

When the Evil Lord rages, heaven and earth darken, and all living things perish.

Hence, upon hearing Ling Taixu’s name, the eight immediately tensed, especially Qiu Daoren, who still held grudges because his family once led an assault that burned Lingxiao Pavilion to the ground. The sect leader now stood before them—past grievances would be hard to smooth.

If a fight broke out, War City would likely be destroyed.

But what surprised these eight was that although Ling Taixu had only recently ascended, his understanding of the Dao and insight into martial arts surpassed theirs.

Had it not been so, how could they have failed to detect Ling Taixu's presence all this time?

Each of these eight had ascended at least fifty years ago. Over fifty years, their strength had improved somewhat but compared to Ling Taixu, their progress was negligible.

How had he achieved this?

“Brother Ling!” Qiu Daoren composed himself, nodding lightly. “Long have I heard of you.”

“Not at all!” Ling Taixu smiled kindly, showing no antagonism, only exceptional humility. “If anything, several of you are my seniors. To be regarded as a brother by you all is my honor.”
