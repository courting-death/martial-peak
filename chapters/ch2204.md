## Chapter 2204 — One Season Missing

Wen Zishan smiled and said, "It would be best if such a good seedling could join the Shrine, but it still depends on his own wishes. However... it wouldn't hurt to give it a try."

At this he turned to Gao Xueting and said, "Elder Gao, you know him best among us. I'll leave this matter to you."

"I don't really know him," Gao Xueting replied calmly. "But since the Hall Master has given the order, I'll give it a try."

Wen Zishan nodded slightly, then changed the subject, "Now, let's discuss what kind of reward would be appropriate for those disciples..."

...

Yang Kai returned to Feiyan Peak of Qingyang Shrine.

The palace that had been damaged in the fierce battle with Xue Yi last time had already been restored as good as new. After entering, Yang Kai activated the restriction barrier, rested for half a day, and then began to check the harvest from his trip to the Four Seasons Land.

Although he hadn't obtained the Calamity Fruit this time in the Four Seasons Land, overall, his gains were still considerable.

Not to mention the many Demonic Beast Inner Cores of various grades and quantities, just the spirit flowers and exotic herbs transplanted into the medicine garden of the Small Xuan Realm were already a great harvest. Most of these spirit flowers and herbs were of the ice attribute.

After all, Yang Kai had spent the most time in the Winter Domain while in the Four Seasons Land, and with Little Snowflake leading the way, at least a tenth of the treasures in the entire Winter Domain had fallen into his hands.

All these spirit flowers and herbs were picked and immediately transplanted into the medicine garden. The environment of the Small Xuan Realm's medicine garden was extremely special, with excellent growing conditions, and with the Everlasting Tree, a supreme treasure of heaven and earth, exuding boundless vitality, there was no need to worry about these plants losing their vigor. On the contrary, their growth cycle would be greatly shortened in the garden.

After being planted in the medicine garden for a year, these flowers and herbs would have their medicinal age increased by at least a hundred years.

Besides these, there was also a Fruit of Time obtained from the Time Temple. Although this thing was of little use for Martial Dao cultivation, it had miraculous effects in certain aspects. If it could be refined into a Time Pill, it would surely be sought after by countless cultivators.

Taking one could restore one's physical condition by decades, or even centuries or millennia. For cultivators nearing the end of their lifespan, this was incredibly attractive.

Especially for women of all ages... who wouldn't want to be a little younger?

Although the effect of the Time Pill was not as good as the legendary Beauty Retaining Pill that could keep one's appearance eternally youthful, the two had different effects, and it was hard to say which was better.

If an old woman full of wrinkles had to choose, she would definitely pick the Time Pill over the Beauty Retaining Pill, because the latter would have no effect on her appearance, while the Time Pill could restore her vitality and youth.

But if a young and beautiful woman had to choose, the Beauty Retaining Pill would undoubtedly be more attractive.

Yang Kai made a silent decision. Once he left Qingyang Shrine, he would find an opportunity to gather the necessary herbs and try refining the Time Pill. Perhaps, at a critical moment, it might produce some miraculous effect.

Besides these, there were also some miscellaneous items.

These included the spoils Yang Kai had obtained from killing others, as well as the Spirit Power Cores gained from defeating puppets in the Time Temple. These were of little use to him and could be exchanged for Source Crystals when the opportunity arose.

After a while, a jade bottle appeared in Yang Kai's hand. He opened the lid, and immediately saw a pill-like object inside.

Emperor Extinction Pill!

This was the Emperor Extinction Pill he had obtained from Wuchang.

The Emperor Extinction Pill contained the full-powered strike of an Emperor Realm expert. Its power was unimaginable, and its refinement was extremely difficult. Generally, only Second Stage Emperor Realm experts were qualified to refine such things. They were consumables given to their juniors for protection.

Every time an Emperor Extinction Pill was refined, the Emperor Realm expert would be weakened for quite some time. So unless absolutely necessary, Emperor Realm experts were unwilling to refine these pills. Even if they did, it was only occasionally, and the quantity was always small.

So even in the entire Star Realm, Emperor Extinction Pills were rare treasures.

And this particular Emperor Extinction Pill was obtained from the Time Temple, left behind by the Great Emperor of Time. Although it was unclear when the Great Emperor of Time had refined it, its value and grade far surpassed ordinary Emperor Extinction Pills.

Perhaps it sealed a strike at the level of a Great Emperor, or an attack equivalent to a Third Stage Emperor Realm master.

In short, this was truly a life-saving trump card. Even if surrounded by thousands of troops or beset by powerful experts, it could turn danger into safety at a critical moment.

Yang Kai carefully put it away, placing it in an easily accessible spot in his Spatial Ring, before turning his attention to the three beads in front of him.

These three beads were identical in size and shape, differing only in color.

One was fiery red, which Yang Kai had obtained in the Time Temple.

At that time, there were many treasures in the temple, and Lan Xun had identified almost all of them, except for this fiery red bead. She couldn't see through its origin or purpose.

Yang Kai had remembered the words Qiong Qi had asked Zhang Ruoxi to pass on: if he could reach the deepest part of the temple, he must take the item that seemed the most useless.

Among those treasures, apart from this Fiery Red Bead, which seemed the most useless, the others were all valuable—whether it was the Quasi-Imperial Treasure, the Taiyi Divine Water, the Imperial Aura, or the Emperor Extinction Pill, all were rare treasures in the outside world.

So Yang Kai went straight for this bead...

No one competed with him for it, so he obtained it easily.

The second bead was emerald green, which Yang Kai had obtained from the ice lake in the Winter Domain.

The third bead was the one he had traded from the round-faced woman of the Eight Directions Sect.

If not for the fact that the round-faced woman had offered such a bead, Yang Kai would never have exchanged the Supreme Mystic Pill! This third bead was pale yellow, like a withered leaf, evoking a sense of autumn's desolation and the falling of a hundred flowers.

Three beads, three colors, but no matter which one he tried, infusing it with Origin Qi or Divine Sense produced no reaction.

Their colors were distinct and clear at a glance.

Considering the Four Seasons Land, it was easy to associate them with spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

The vibrant green clearly represented the vitality of spring, the fiery red the brilliance of summer, and the pale yellow obviously stood for autumn!

One season was missing—only the Winter Bead was nowhere to be found.

Yang Kai estimated that if he could find the last Winter Bead, he might be able to unlock the secrets hidden within these four beads. But now that the Four Seasons Land was closed, even if he wanted to search for it, it was impossible.

After observing for a while, Yang Kai sighed and put away the three Four Seasons Beads. He didn't know what to call them, so he decided to name them the Four Seasons Beads in his heart.

If fate allowed, perhaps he could find the last bead in this life. If not, he might never see it. In the vast Star Realm, how difficult would it be to find a single Winter Bead?

Overall, Yang Kai's gains this time were not few, but not many either.

Not to mention the benefits from the tempering of the Power of Time on the Time Steps, and the Imperial Treasure Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress that Zhang Ruoxi obtained.

Yang Kai quickly sorted out the miscellaneous items he couldn't use and threw them all into the Small Xuan Realm, giving them to the Incarnation.

These included all sorts of Spiritual Pills, minerals, and even Secret Treasures found in others' Spatial Rings.

After all, the Incarnation cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, and with the innate divine abilities of the Stone Puppet clan, anything in the world with Spiritual Qi could be devoured...

Now, Yang Kai estimated that even if he gave the Incarnation an Imperial Treasure, it could swallow and absorb it, turning it into strength.

A moment later, Yang Kai formed a seal and, with a flicker, entered the Small Xuan Realm.

His Divine Sense swept out, and every movement in the Small Xuan Realm was imprinted in his mind.

As expected, the Incarnation was cultivating, and the Stone Puppet body never knew fatigue, so it cultivated tirelessly.

The two living people in the Small Xuan Realm, Zhang Ruoxi and Hua Qingsi, each occupied a pavilion, sitting cross-legged.

Perhaps it was because the Xuan Realm Pearl had devoured such a vast sea of Spiritual Qi last time that, upon entering, Yang Kai found the cultivation environment here to be noticeably improved.

It seemed that if there was a chance, the Xuan Realm Pearl should absorb more of the world's Spiritual Qi, at least in situations like the last time with the sea of Spiritual Qi.

With a thought, he deliberately gathered the Spiritual Qi in the Small Xuan Realm toward the pavilions, so that Zhang Ruoxi and Hua Qingsi could cultivate more efficiently.

Last time in the sea of Spiritual Qi in the Four Seasons Land, Zhang Ruoxi had advanced to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Now, with little time having passed, she was still consolidating her cultivation.

However... Yang Kai didn't dare underestimate her just because of her weak cultivation.

Bringing Zhang Ruoxi into the Four Seasons Land this time had allowed Yang Kai to witness many incredible things.

He clearly remembered that when Zhang Ruoxi was advancing to the Origin Returning Realm, a huge heroic female phantom suddenly appeared behind her. That phantom was a woman's figure, as if Zhang Ruoxi had been magnified countless times. With just one mouthful, she absorbed the energy vortex in the sky, and in the blink of an eye, Zhang Ruoxi succeeded in her breakthrough without any obstacles.

Afterwards, in the Time Temple, when Zhang Ruoxi was about to be unable to withstand the washing of the power of time, it was Qiong Qi, the Divine Spirit, who saved her life and even gave her the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress...

If someone claimed that Zhang Ruoxi harbored no secrets, Yang Kai would never believe it—not even if his life depended on it.

Qiong Qi was a ferocious beast, renowned even in ancient times. Any cultivator who encountered it rarely survived, yet such a Divine Spirit was willing to save Zhang Ruoxi.
