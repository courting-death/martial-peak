## Chapter 1195 — Taking the Blame

The golden radiance that had once been impossibly vivid on the pond's surface was now dimmed to almost nothing. Everyone hurriedly circulated their power to try to absorb it, only to find that the medicinal efficacy of the pond — the Soul Cleansing Divine Water — had been reduced to a pitiable, nearly nonexistent state.

This left all of them both astonished and enraged.

"It's him!" Qu Changfeng snarled, clenching his teeth as he glared at the cold-faced man.

In an instant dozens of eyes turned to the cold-faced man, displeasure written on every face. Yang Kai likewise wore a look of gritted-teeth fury, as if some benefit that should have been his had been stolen, and once more he suppressed the Warm Spirit Lotus.

In that brief span, nearly nine-tenths of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water's potency had been drawn into his Sea of Consciousness and poured into the six-colored Warm Spirit Lotus. Of the remaining tenth, half had already been taken by the others earlier — at most only a final half-tenth remained in the pool.

It wasn't that Yang Kai didn't want to continue absorbing it; it was that the cultivators here were emotionally unstable and hypervigilant. If he acted as he had moments before, someone with intent might spot a flaw — he certainly wouldn't make himself the target of everyone's ire.

Let the cold man take the blame; after all, not only was his personal strength formidable, his backing force was likewise immensely powerful. No matter how resentful those present grew, none would dare make trouble for him.

Sure enough, though the thirty-plus cultivators gazed at him as if they wished him dead, not one dared truly strike — not even Qu Changfeng seemed inclined to act.

After a moment they closed their eyes again, racing against the clock to snatch whatever medicinal effect of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water still lingered in the pool.

Now only a little of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water remained; if they did not seize it, someone else would benefit.

That cold and indifferent man also seemed to have reached a crucial point in his comprehension. He was completely unaware of everything happening outside and had no idea he was taking the blame for Yang Kai. Immersed entirely in grasping the profound subtleties of the Void King Realm expert’s Soul Technique, his gains were simply unimaginable. The remaining Soul Cleansing Divine Water in the pool surged even more frantically toward his side.

About a day later, the nearly thirty cultivators sitting cross-legged in the pool opened their eyes one after another. In each person’s gaze flickered a trace of joy, yet mingled within that joy were also deep regret and resentment.

Every person who had soaked here had gained a great improvement in Divine Sense; in that nearly day-long span the increase in their Divine Sense power was almost equivalent to many years of painstaking cultivation.

Moreover, the Soul Cleansing Divine Water's purging had swept away hidden troubles left by earlier Divine Sense injuries for some cultivators, making them as good as new. When they circulated their Divine Sense, each found it more condensed and clearer than ever before.

It seemed they had also received some fundamental benefit, which delighted them greatly — a basic alteration to their Divine Sense meant that future cultivation of Divine Sense power would be far easier than before.

If such vast changes could occur in a mere day, what might happen given a longer span?

It was truly a pity: if someone hadn't taken the lion's share, they could have soaked here for at least ten days. No one dared imagine how much their Divine Sense would have improved over those days.

For a moment their gazes returned to the cold-faced man, now filled with hatred.

The cold man had by now completely comprehended the Soul Technique of the Void King Realm; a dangerous thread of satisfaction had creased his previously stern face. Yet when he saw everyone staring at him with hostility, he was somewhat bewildered, not understanding what grave offense he had committed.

However, he soon attributed the hostility of these people to jealousy. Although the disappearance of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water’s medicinal effects had startled him, once he recalled his earlier comprehension of the Soul Technique and the tremendous growth of his own Divine Sense, he seemed to have found a reasonable explanation.

Could it be that he had indeed absorbed the majority of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, and that was why they were so furious?

The cold man could not fully make sense of the situation, but he had no intention of quarreling. He snorted, rose from the pool, leapt out, circulated his Saint Yuan midair to steam away the water clinging to him, and after landing walked out without looking back.

The place's greatest benefit was gone, and he naturally did not wish to remain and be despised.

The remaining thirty-odd people looked at one another, seemingly not expecting him to be so brisk and decisive.

"He gets off lucky this time!" Qu Changfeng ground his teeth in hatred and smashed his fist into the pool's edge, his expression feral.

No one else dared speak rashly; after a while they sighed and each rose from the pool, walking out one by one.

Gazing at the pool of spiritual liquid, everyone’s expressions showed a hint of disappointment and disinterest.

At other times and in other places, encountering such a pool of spirit liquid would have made them ecstatic. After all, spirit liquid was a rare treasure formed over countless years; its benefit to a cultivator could surpass that of an Upper-Level Saint Crystal. Whether for cultivation or for recovery, it was excellent.

But after witnessing the marvel of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water, the spirit liquid seemed insignificant — merely the residue left after the loss of the soul-cleansing effect.

Even so, it would make no sense to leave a treasure before their eyes uncollected. It was just that everyone’s mood was tinged with a subtle, indescribable complexity.

“Young Master Qu, how do you think we should divide this spiritual liquid?” the beautiful woman asked cautiously, looking at Qu Changfeng for his opinion. A trace of self-mockery lingered on her charming face as she added, “Our background is small and humble — unlike that person, who doesn’t even spare a glance at this entire pool of spiritual liquid. To us, this liquid is still a precious treasure.”

"Yes, Young Master Qu, what do you say? We'll all follow your call — who'd dare disobey? We'll act together and kill if need be," a cultivator from a force with good ties to the Battle Sky Alliance said in agreement. Earlier, when the Soul Cleansing Divine Water had been parceled out, Qu Changfeng had favored him a little; although that division had become a joke, now was his chance to show fealty.

"Very well, then this spirit liquid — my Battle Sky Alliance will take half!" Qu Changfeng snapped.

His fury did not dissipate because of the others' flattery; whenever he thought of the enormous benefit of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water he had not received, Qu Changfeng's hatred burned all the more.

At his words their faces shifted; one man couldn't help but mutter under his breath, "Wasn't it supposed to be a quarter before?"

"What, you have objections?" Qu Changfeng glared at the speaker, a clear glint of murderous intent in his eyes.

"Young Master Qu, you misunderstand. This junior brother merely isn't good with words—how dare he complain? Young Master Qu, be magnanimous; don't be offended on his account," a scholarly-looking man immediately stepped forward, his expression uneasy as he spoke to Qu Changfeng, and then snapped at the other fellow: "If you can't speak properly, shut your mouth, nobody would think you're mute — apologize to Young Master Qu!"

Everyone knew Qu Changfeng could not be provoked in his current state; his belly was full of anger and he sought any excuse to vent. Only a fool would invite trouble.

If the scholar did not intercede for his junior brother, Qu Changfeng would certainly unleash slaughter. Whether the other side would then relent was unknown; the scholar only prayed Qu Changfeng would not unleash his fury on his junior brother.

The man who had spoken earlier proved sensible and realized he'd spoken out of turn; he hurried forward and offered a respectful apology.

Qu Changfeng snorted coldly: "Only this once. Next time you speak nonsense I'll take your life! Taking half the spirit liquid — so what? Even if I monopolized this place, what grievance could you possibly have?"

"We wouldn't dare!" they all hastily nodded, their faces embarrassed.

The greatest benefit had already been taken by that cold man; if Qu Changfeng truly monopolized the place, they would leave with almost nothing.

"Go fetch it!" Qu Changfeng ordered a sectmate, who immediately stepped forward and began to draw the spirit liquid.

The others stood silently at the side, hoping Qu Changfeng would keep his word and really only take half.

Qu Changfeng's gaze suddenly fell upon Yang Kai, cold as ice.

The instant that look landed on him, Yang Kai knew what he intended.

The man truly sought an opportunity to vent his anger. Others were in small groups with considerable backing; Qu Changfeng wouldn't dare truly strike them, and so he had fixated on someone solitary and without ties — him.

Yang Kai split his lips in a smile, then exploded backward and shot out of the stone chamber.

He had no wish to entangle himself with this fellow. Though not afraid, if he were to kill him by accident it would draw down the Battle Sky Alliance's ire. With so many witnesses present, unless he killed them all the secret would be exposed.

Yang Kai was not yet prepared to take on the behemoth that was the Battle Sky Alliance.

Qu Changfeng's strength was considerable; Yang Kai judged he could not slay him easily. Even the Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure Qu Changfeng had once used possessed extraordinary power.

The spirit liquid was not indispensable — it was only superior to an Upper-Level Saint Crystal, not a treasure of heaven and earth — so Yang Kai decisively departed without a hint of regret.

"You ran fast!" Qu Changfeng was taken aback, not having expected Yang Kai's swiftness. He didn't give chase, merely grumbled.

The pool of spirit liquid looked ample, but once split among the eight forces present it was soon reduced to the bottom.

The milky-white crystals accumulated on the pool's floor were scraped clean as well. After searching the stone chamber to confirm there was nothing else worthwhile, the others left in succession, each looking somewhat reluctant.

Outside, the group bid Qu Changfeng farewell and dispersed in different directions.

After the time it takes to burn an incense stick, ten li from the stalactite cave, three people stopped in a mountain hollow — they were the trio from the eight forces who had the fewest numbers in the stone chamber.

Two of them were Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and one was Second Stage of the Saint King Realm.

At that moment the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm was cursing and railing at Qu Changfeng's domineering arrogance — when the Soul Cleansing Divine Water had been divided earlier they had received the smallest share, and again when the spirit liquid was portioned they received the least, for no other reason than their having the fewest numbers.
