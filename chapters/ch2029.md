## Chapter 2029 — Soaring All the Way

"Is everyone watching carefully? Alright — although this little old man is no alchemist, my cultivation method is fire-based, so I can slightly stimulate this alchemical furnace's power. Very well, I'll show you how extraordinary this thing truly is," the Drunken Old Man said, then suddenly tossed the Ink Jade Cauldron he'd been holding and quickly formed spirit seals.

As he poured wave after wave of pure Origin Qi into the Ink Jade Cauldron, the little vessel swelled as if filled by a gust of wind, rapidly growing to the height of a person before thumping down on the raised platform with a clear, resonant clang.

After it enlarged, the intricate patterns on its surface became even clearer.

Moreover, under the sweep of cultivators' Divine Sense one could even see inside the furnace: four dragon heads were inlaid, and light flowed within the cauldron, dazzling to behold.

"The master who forged this cauldron must have been extraordinary. He had inscribed countless spirit formations within it, all usable for alchemy. If one could discern them in detail, one would no longer need to carve formations while refining pills—simply trigger those already inside. The four dragon heads allow precise control of the flame, and there are other wondrous functions. Watch closely," he said.

The Drunken Old Man lifted his gourd and downed another mouthful of strong wine; his cheeks flushed redder. He patted his chest and spat toward the Ink Jade Cauldron.

A fire dragon spewed from his mouth, its head and tail thrashing; when it struck the Ink Jade Cauldron it plunged inside like a stone sinking into the sea and vanished.

The Drunken Old Man deftly wove spirit seals once more, a faint, enigmatic smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.

Suddenly one of the dragon heads on the cauldron blasted forth a roaring flame; the fire burned with searing heat yet glowed an eerie blue, and under the Drunken Old Man's control its intensity could be increased or decreased.

Then the second dragon head spat flame, then the third, then the fourth…

The Drunken Old Man withdrew his hand-seals and stood motionless to one side.

Yet the furnace's flames did not die; instead they continued to burn, seeming as if they could persist for a very long time.

"This furnace can store energy?" someone with an eye for quality exclaimed.

"Exactly, sharp-eyed friend," the Drunken Old Man laughed. "I barely used much force just now—equivalent to an ordinary blow—but pouring that into the furnace is enough to keep it burning for half a day. Once the temperature is set properly, it will remain stable and no longer fluctuate. You can imagine how much this helps an alchemist."

When he finished speaking, the hall erupted in a clamor.

Although he had not explained every detail, the cultivators present immediately grasped the cauldron's value.

When an alchemist refined pills they needed to constantly monitor ingredients, control the flame, and keep pouring in force; they could not step away.

But with this Ink Jade Cauldron it was different: an alchemist only needed to set a temperature and pour in sufficient energy; for a stretch of time the furnace would maintain that state.

The alchemist could use that time to properly recuperate.

Many failures in alchemy resulted from a cultivator's internal power failing to persist through the process.

With this Ink Jade Cauldron, that worry would vanish.

Beyond ordinary furnace functions, it had unique features and held a Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level rank; in the eyes of alchemists its value approached that of an Imperial Treasure!

"Time is limited, so this little old man won't go through the cauldron's other functions one by one. But I can guarantee this: if any alchemist were to possess it, they could advance a full tier in pill refinement."

At that claim countless people drew sharp breaths.

Advancing as an alchemist was even harder than advancing as a martial artist; many alchemists remained stuck at Void King-Grade Upper-Level their whole lives. If the Drunken Old Man's words were true, a Void King-Grade alchemist might gain the chance to refine Dao Origin-Grade pills, and success rates would be far higher.

Such temptations stirred the alchemists present, and representatives of sects and families watched with heated eyes.

"Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemical furnace — Ink Jade Cauldron. Starting bid one million Source Crystals, each increase no less than fifty thousand. Gentlemen, begin," the Drunken Old Man proclaimed cheerfully and stepped aside.

"Starting bid one million…" Yang Kai's mouth twitched at the words.

The Drunken Old Man's extravagant claims had earlier aroused Yang Kai's interest in the Ink Jade Cauldron.

Yang Kai's own furnace had come from his delving into the Imperial Garden long ago — the Purple Void Cauldron, a Void King-Grade Upper-Level furnace. It had accompanied him, but compared to the Ink Jade Cauldron it was not in the same league.

The starting price of one million still made Yang Kai smile wryly.

He had only a little over one million Source Crystals on hand, likely just enough to call out the opening bid…

"The Ink Jade Cauldron is truly that miraculous?" Kang Siran asked in surprise.

Though he could rely on his good relations with the City Lord to get early information, he did not know much about this Ink Jade Cauldron; hearing the Drunken Old Man, his expression turned grave.

If he could secure this furnace, the Spiritual Pill workshop's output would surely rise, and as its manager his performance would improve; perhaps one day he'd receive rewards and promotion from the Commerce Guild's headquarters.

But thinking of the finale Dao Origin Fruit made him hesitate.

He glanced at Yang Kai and, seeing him also smile wryly, asked in surprise, "Pillmaster Yang, you won't bid?"

"No, just watching the show," Yang Kai replied, shaking his head slowly.

Kang Siran nodded in understanding and said nothing more.

While they spoke, the auction had already begun; oddly, no one bid at first — the hall fell silent as everyone waited to gauge the market.

For a time the atmosphere grew tense and strange.

If someone else had presided, they'd likely wait confidently; good items seldom lacked bidders. But this time the auctioneer was the Drunken Old Man…

After a long moment with no bids, the Drunken Old Man grinned and said, "It seems the first item of this auction is destined to pass unsold—if so then…"

"Hold on, Deputy City Lord, aren't you being a bit too impatient?" a man's voice called from a private box.

"Then will you bid or not? If you won't I'll buy it myself and resell it later for a handsome profit," the Drunken Old Man called cheerfully back.

Hearing that, many people rolled their eyes.

An auctioneer actually bidding — they'd never seen or heard of such a thing; only the Drunken Old Man could say it aloud.

"Very well, since everyone is so reserved, I'll start with one million to set an example," the man in the box said helplessly.

"One million is too little — one million five hundred thousand, the Du Family claims this Ink Jade Cauldron."

"One million five hundred thousand and you dare to make such a bold opening? Ridiculous — the Jiang Family bids one million eight hundred thousand!"

"Then the Qin Family will join the fun as well — two million!"

Once the first bid appeared, others quickly followed; those bidding represented powerful families. After all, such vast sums of Source Crystals were beyond most cultivators; only sects and families could bear them.

In an instant, the private boxes exploded into eager bids as the major factions threw themselves into the fray. The Drunken Old Man chuckled, fell silent, hoisted his large gourd, and drank to himself, unconcerned by the commotion.

The great families in Fenglin City were already at odds beneath the surface; this Ink Jade Cauldron could clearly boost a clan's strength, so none were willing to let it go.

In a mere thirty breaths the Ink Jade Cauldron's price rose to two million seven hundred thousand, and it continued rocketing upward as no one wanted to quit.

Half a cup of tea later the price had already passed four million; only then did some families fall silent, evidently having reached their limits.

The Ink Jade Cauldron was priceless, but the finale Dao Origin Fruit could directly establish someone in the Dao Origin Realm; compared with that, some had to grit their teeth and give up.

By that point Yang Kai had entirely become a spectator; if earlier the one-million opening had made him consider selling some belongings to raise Source Crystals, now he had abandoned hope.

"The Ink Jade Cauldron is a must for the Jiang Family — four million one hundred thousand!" a resonant voice called from the Jiang Family's box.

Others fell silent; many dared not compete with the Jiang Family, whose strength in Fenglin City was considerable, and those willing to oppose them lacked the necessary Source Crystals and had to withdraw.

Seeing this, the Jiang Family's bidder rejoiced and began, "Deputy City Lord, may I—"

Before he could finish, a coquettish voice suddenly interjected: "Elder Jiang, don't be so hasty—this Little Sister hasn't bid yet. Hmm, I'll offer four million two hundred thousand."

At this the thick-browed, broad-eyed man in the Jiang box's eyes flashed; he peered toward the voice and called, "Shopkeeper Zhuo?"

At the same time Kang Siran snorted: "Zhuo Ningsi! That bitch simply cannot restrain herself."

As sworn enemies, Kang Siran immediately recognized that alluring voice as the Danqi Pavilion's shopkeeper Zhuo Ningsi.
