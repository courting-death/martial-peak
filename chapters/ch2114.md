## Chapter 2114 — Refining Dragon Blood

Yang Kai did not think too much about it. After detecting Zhang Ruoxi’s life force fading, he immediately summoned the Xuan Realm Pearl and brought her into the Small Xuan Realm, arriving beside the medicine garden.

Laying Zhang Ruoxi flat on the ground, Yang Kai gestured; the world trembled and a tangible wind stirred. From the distant Everlasting Tree, a visible emerald aura danced along the wind, swirling around Zhang Ruoxi’s body and enveloping her, pouring in through her pores.

Since her life force had been depleted, it only needed replenishment.

The astonishing vitality released by the Everlasting Tree was the perfect remedy.

As expected, once the Everlasting Tree’s vitality infused her, Zhang Ruoxi’s tightly furrowed brows relaxed, her pain vanished, replaced by immense joy.

Yang Kai probed with his Divine Sense and found her condition rapidly improving; her aging organs and meridians regained youthful luster.

The misfortune she suffered was entirely due to external forces, so the Everlasting Tree’s vitality could resolve it well. If it had been an old man already at death’s door, whether he could be restored here would be uncertain.

After a full hour, Yang Kai checked again and confirmed Zhang Ruoxi was safe and sound. Moreover, nourished by the Everlasting Tree’s vitality, she seemed to have gained other benefits.

Only then did he take Zhang Ruoxi out of the Small Xuan Realm and send her to her own boudoir.

Zhang Ruoxi was still asleep, but she should wake up soon.

Through this, Yang Kai confirmed his earlier suspicion—Zhang Ruoxi’s cultivation was insufficient and she could not comprehend the mysteries hidden within the Ethereal Jade Disc.

It was precisely because her cultivation was lacking that her life force was forcibly extracted.

But… where did those scenes come from? And what place did that unformed Void Passage connect to? While Yang Kai was puzzled, he was also eager to find the answer.

He instinctively felt that the Ethereal Jade Disc concealed a world-shaking secret!

Returning to his own room, Yang Kai set up a barrier and secretly sent word to the Zhang Family matron, informing her he would be in seclusion for a while and would not receive guests until he emerged. After receiving a reply, he re-entered the Small Xuan Realm.

He first checked on Liu Yan and found her still struggling to refine the Luanfeng feather, contending with the power within the divine feather. Though the situation was tense, it was not dangerous.

He did not linger; instead he sought a secluded spot and sat cross-legged.

He sat there for two days, until his energy, spirit, and mind returned to their peak. Only then did Yang Kai wave his hand, and two items appeared before him.

A jade bottle and a sword with no edge or blade.

Inside the jade bottle, a drop of crimson liquid churned restlessly. From time to time, it transformed into a tiny dragon, darting about, spitting Blazing Flame from its mouth and scorching the bottle, as if it possessed a spirit and wished to escape.

Fire Dragon’s blood!

Yang Kai had obtained it from the first floor’s Dragon Ascension Altar in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, but since acquiring it, he had never used it.

The other item, the sword with no edge or blade, was Yang Kai’s Dragon Bone Sword, Dripping Jade.

The Dragon Bone Sword was forged from a section of Dragon Spine Bone he found in the Flowing Flame Sandland on Dark Star, combined with a roughly refined Dragon Pearl, without damaging the material’s properties.

At this moment, Yang Kai took out these two True Dragon Treasures with an obvious purpose—refining!

He had already refined one Dragon Treasure—the Dragon Scale—placed at his chest’s vital spot. Relying on its formidable defense, Yang Kai had benefited many times in battle.

Even now, he still remembered the pain endured when refining the Dragon Scale into his body.

Previously, he had not considered refining more Dragon Treasures because his cultivation was insufficient.

But now, he had advanced to the Dao Origin Realm, and would not be able to break through again for a while. To strengthen himself, he could only seek other methods.

And refining Dragon Blood and the Dragon Bone Sword into his body was the most direct and effective way.

He possessed the Yao Transformation Technique and the Golden Sacred Dragon’s Origin Power, enough to make the impossible possible.

His gaze lingered between the Dragon Bone Sword and the Dragon Blood for a moment, then he decisively picked up the jade bottle.

Sensing something, the tiny dragon in the bottle turned its head and glared at Yang Kai. Its mouth opened, and a pillar of fire shot toward Yang Kai’s face…

But the jade bottle was no ordinary item. Since it could store True Dragon Blood, it was specially refined, so the tiny dragon’s actions could not harm Yang Kai at all, making it look rather comical.

Yang Kai smirked and directly opened the bottle.

Instantly, the tiny dragon shot out from the bottle, its tail flicking as it turned into a streak of fire, trying to escape.

But in the Small Xuan Realm, all things obeyed his will. How could it escape Yang Kai’s grasp?

Yang Kai simply reached out and grasped the void, freezing the fire in midair. The tiny dragon struggled, roaring, but could not break free from Yang Kai’s hold.

With Law Power enveloping it, the tiny dragon, full of unwillingness, condensed once more into a drop of Dragon Blood, like molten lava, radiating intense heat.

Yang Kai beckoned, and the Dragon Blood flew before him.

He observed for a moment, his expression tense, but without much hesitation, he opened his mouth, wrapped the Dragon Blood in Origin Qi, and swallowed it directly.

Immediately, he activated the Yao Transformation Technique, using his Dao Origin Realm cultivation to begin refining the pure Fire Dragon Blood.

The Dragon Blood entered his body, rolling into his abdomen. The Origin Qi seemed unable to withstand the scorching heat and was instantly burned away. His lower abdomen felt like a volcano, constantly erupting with molten lava.

Yang Kai dared not slacken, continuously channeling more Origin Qi to assault the trace of spirit within the Dragon Blood, determined to extinguish it.

Time passed slowly. The place where Yang Kai sat seemed to become scorched earth.

The ground dried up, nearby trees withered, cracks appeared, and even the space was distorted by the intense heat.

Within Yang Kai’s body, a faint dragon’s roar echoed. The spirit within the Dragon Blood was making its final struggle and resistance.

Suddenly, the sound ceased.

At the same time, Yang Kai felt a surging, scorching power erupt in his abdomen, rampaging through his meridians and flesh.

He groaned, his face turning deathly pale.

Sweeping with his Divine Sense, he could clearly see the damage to his meridians and flesh. The terrifying heat had severely injured his body in an instant.

After all, it was True Dragon Blood—even Yang Kai’s body could barely withstand it.

Fortunately, his Golden Blood began to exert its powerful healing ability, resisting the destructive heat of the Dragon Blood and gradually maintaining a balance.

At this moment, Yang Kai felt as if he were sitting atop an erupting volcano, the heat making his consciousness blur.

In the haze, Yang Kai even saw a hallucination—a primordial True Dragon, blazing red, with majestic eyes, floating before him and staring intently.

Then, the Ancient Dragon let out a deafening roar, opened its massive maw, and lunged at Yang Kai, intent on swallowing him whole.

“Hmph!” At that moment, Yang Kai’s eyes flashed, and he shouted, “I’ve been waiting for you!”

As his words fell, the Golden Sacred Dragon’s Origin Power surged within him, transforming into a radiant Golden Dragon that appeared behind Yang Kai, baring its fangs and claws as it lunged at the Fire Dragon.

The Fire Dragon never expected such a turn. Stunned, its majestic eyes flickered with fear, and it retreated repeatedly.

Though every dragon was born strong, they relied too much on their bloodline power, and the suppression from a superior bloodline was deeply rooted. The Golden Sacred Dragon’s bloodline was far superior to the Fire Dragon’s.

The Fire Dragon retreated, but the Golden Dragon’s phantom did not pause, pouncing and tearing with its jaws.

The once-mighty Fire Dragon’s body, seemingly invincible, was torn like paper. The Golden Dragon took a huge gulp and swallowed the Fire Dragon whole.

The Golden Dragon shook its head and tail, majestic and domineering, surveying the surroundings. Seeing no rivals under heaven, it lazily returned to Yang Kai’s body.

Thus, the spirit within that drop of Dragon Blood was completely eradicated.

As the Fire Dragon’s spirit vanished, the pressure on Yang Kai eased. He urged his Golden Blood’s healing power to repair his meridians and flesh, while recklessly fusing the Fire Dragon Blood into every muscle and meridian.

This was a task that tested both willpower and patience.

Yang Kai was not in a hurry, proceeding methodically.

No one knew how much time passed, but eventually, that drop of True Dragon Blood was completely refined by Yang Kai.

He slowly opened his eyes and stood up.

After a brief assessment, his cultivation had not increased, but Yang Kai could clearly feel he had grown stronger.

This strength was not in his physical body, but…

“Dragon Transformation!” Yang Kai called out in a low voice.

His bloodline surged, and the power of Dragon Blood exploded. The bones in his hands suddenly expanded, transforming into two sharp dragon claws with a series of cracking sounds.

On his arms, scales formed from condensed Origin Qi gradually appeared, each one fiery red and seemingly infused with the power of flame.

Even the real Dragon Scale at his chest began to change, splitting from one to two, two to four, four to eight…

Yang Kai looked as if he were wearing a suit of Dragon Scale armor.

He waved his hands, feeling the endless power surging within, and laughed heartily.
