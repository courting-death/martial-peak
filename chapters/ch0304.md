## Chapter 304 — So You All Can't Protect Yourselves

It was not that Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo were careless; rather, the two had just been discussing trivial matters, and neither expected that there would be others ahead.

When the two appeared, they instantly attracted everyone's attention.

The ones surrounding Qiu Yimeng and the others were likely martial artists from Cangyun Evil Land. Their numbers and strength far exceeded those of Qiu Yimeng's side. They were leisurely watching the two women in the arena, their expressions relaxed, ready to enjoy the struggle and resistance of these beauties in a desperate situation.

The struggle and resistance of beautiful women always had a unique flavor, especially Luo Xiaoman, whose ample bosom trembled in fear, swaying up and down, which only fueled the primal desires of that group, their eyes gleaming with excitement.

Thus, even though they held an absolute advantage, this group did not rush to attack Qiu Yimeng and the others. Instead, they wore shameless lewd smiles, their expressions filled with ambiguity.

"Haha... this time we hit the jackpot!" When Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo revealed themselves, a burly man at the Eighth Stage of True Yuan Realm suddenly brightened, looking at Shan Qingluo and laughing wildly.

Shan Qingluo, known as the most enchanting woman in the world, naturally possessed her own unique charm, which was undoubtedly more alluring than that of Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, who were mere girls.

Especially as this enchanting woman was currently in a desperate escape, her body glistening with fragrant sweat, her cheeks flushed, making her look even more seductive.

The burly man stared at Shan Qingluo with burning eyes, his breath becoming heavy as he shouted, "Big Brother, look! Another beauty has come to us! This woman is so full of charm!"

"Indeed! In my entire life, I've never seen such a captivating woman. Let me have a taste first, and after I’m done, my little brothers can have their turn. A woman like this can be played with a hundred times without getting bored." Another person chimed in, equally excited.

"Isn't there also two little girls here? Although they can't compare to this woman in charm, they are still rare beauties. We are truly blessed today!"

"Hahaha..."

The filthy words from the group left Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman pale, while Shan Qingluo's pretty face darkened.

Among that group, the only expert at the Divine Roaming Realm stared blankly at Shan Qingluo, suddenly changing his expression, and shouted sternly, "Shut up!"

The crowd's shouts and laughter came to an abrupt halt.

"What’s wrong, Big Brother?" The others were puzzled, not understanding why he had such a ghostly expression.

The expert at the Divine Roaming Realm felt cold sweat trickling down his forehead. Suddenly, with a serious expression, he cupped his fists towards Shan Qingluo and said, "I am Gu Tianluo, a subordinate of the Beast King. I greet the Queen!"

The others did not recognize Shan Qingluo, but this expert at the Divine Roaming Realm clearly had seen her before. Enchanting and alluring, with a beauty mark at the corner of her eye, dressed in a red gown...

Wasn't this the ruthless and bloodthirsty Enchantress Queen?

Usually, if any man dared to show even a hint of lewdness while looking at her, she would tear him to shreds.

But now, her subordinates, these reckless fools, actually wanted to toy with her? Praising her charm and suggesting they take a taste first?

It was over! With her temperament, none of these people would escape today.

As he respectfully saluted, Gu Tianluo felt a chill in his heart. The confidence and bravado he had just moments ago vanished without a trace, leaving only deep fear.

What a bunch of fools! Even if you want to court death, don’t drag me down with you!

What could have been a delightful experience with two little beauties had now turned into a step into the gates of hell, a stark contrast.

Gu Tianluo's frustration was beyond imagination.

Moreover, that enchanting woman’s expression was clearly not good. This time, they were likely facing a calamity they could not escape.

As Gu Tianluo respectfully saluted, the others were also taken aback, carefully considering his words. The Queen, the Queen—who else could it be but that enchanting woman?

In an instant, everyone began to tremble, fear and horror etched on their faces. They never expected that the woman they had just teased was that one!

The situation took a sharp turn, and Qiu Yimeng seized a glimmer of hope, urgently calling out, "Yang Kai!"

Yang Kai grinned at them, subtly squeezing Shan Qingluo's palm, signaling her to leave quickly. There were still several experts at the Divine Roaming Realm pursuing them.

Shan Qingluo nodded slightly, merely snorting softly. Without saying a word, she and Yang Kai strolled leisurely away.

Qiu Yimeng quickly forced a strained smile, revealing her charm just enough, and gasped, "Yang Kai, you wouldn’t just watch us die, would you? After all, we came together."

Qiu Yimeng had experienced Shan Qingluo's methods before, having seen three Divine Roaming Realm experts killed with a mere wave of her hand! Although she had grievances with her, she was still a woman. Falling into her hands was certainly better than falling into the hands of the scoundrels before her.

She had taken Yang Kai away that day, and now the two appeared here, looking intimate. Qiu Yimeng naturally assumed they had some relationship, which is why she placed her hopes on Yang Kai.

As long as Shan Qingluo could make a move, they could escape this sea of suffering and avoid this calamity.

"Yang Kai, save us!" Luo Xiaoman also cried out, her eyes filled with hope and pleading.

"Hehe... do we know each other?" Yang Kai smiled lightly, glancing at them with an indifferent expression.

At this moment, Yang Kai was also like a clay Buddha crossing the river, unable to protect himself. How could he have the mood to care about others’ lives?

Moreover, if it weren’t for Qiu Yimeng leading people to Lingxiao Pavilion, he would have long been enjoying a carefree life with Su Yan, not having to worry about his life day and night!

If one were to trace back, these two women were the root cause of all this. Yang Kai would be doing well not to trouble them.

"It’s me, Yang Kai! I’m Luo Xiaoman! We’ve met before," Luo Xiaoman thought Yang Kai had forgotten her and quickly explained, her voice urgent and sorrowful, "Please, please save us!"

"What benefits are there in saving you?" Yang Kai chuckled, having already walked a fair distance with Shan Qingluo.

"What do you want? Both I and Sister Qiu can give it to you!"

"I want you. Can you give that?"

Luo Xiaoman was instantly speechless, and Qiu Yimeng couldn't help but take a deep breath, a hint of disgust appearing on her face.

"We should go!" Yang Kai said softly to Shan Qingluo, "Before we leave, let’s scare them a bit, so they don’t bully those two women!"

"Do you like them?" Shan Qingluo looked at Yang Kai suspiciously.

"No, I just think it would feel strange if they were ruined," Yang Kai frowned, "Actually, I’m quite sympathetic to the fairer sex."

Shan Qingluo let out a light laugh. Before she could shout, a furious shout from Gu Yuanming came from behind: "Vile maid, don’t you dare run!"

The two's expressions changed slightly, and without caring about anything else, they quickly flew away.

Gu Tianluo looked up suspiciously, furrowing his brows as he shouted, "Is that you, Brother Gu?"

Gu Yuanming was taken aback, his expression filled with joy as he said, "Brother Gu, quickly stop that enchanting woman Shan Qingluo!"

"Ah..." Gu Tianluo was greatly alarmed, thinking to himself that he had encountered the worst luck today. Not only were his subordinates blind, but even Gu Yuanming had gone mad.

You can be crazy, but why drag me into it?

"Don’t miss this opportunity! That enchanting woman is heavily injured and no longer has her former might!" Gu Yuanming shouted.

Gu Tianluo stood up straight, thinking no wonder she hurried past him. When his subordinates teased her, she ignored them.

So she was heavily injured!

In an instant, the humility and fear on Gu Tianluo's face vanished completely. He decisively formed seals with both hands, and a golden light shot out rapidly.

Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo had barely flown a distance of ten zhang when a golden light rushed towards them, suddenly transforming into a shimmering golden barrier, crashing towards them.

Caught off guard, Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo collided head-on, the astonishing rebound force sending them both flying backward.

As they landed, Gu Yuanming and the others had already closed in, spreading out to surround them.

Yang Kai cursed angrily, feeling that his luck today was truly terrible; even fleeing had led to an interception.

"Hahaha!" Gu Yuanming laughed, looking at Shan Qingluo with a cold and sinister gaze, "My lady, you can’t escape. You might as well save your strength!"

Shan Qingluo snorted coldly, her beautiful eyes fixed on Gu Tianluo, and shouted, "Gu Tianluo, do you want to die?"

Gu Tianluo shrank his neck and chuckled awkwardly, "My lady is joking. Who wants to die while they can live? Today, my subordinates have offended you, and I only wish to keep you here for a good chat, with no other intentions. I hope my lady can see this!"

"If you don’t want to die, then kill them for me. Everything today will be forgiven!" Shan Qingluo's voice was icy.

Gu Yuanming sneered, "Vile maid! Stop putting on your airs here. Do you really think you’re still in your prime? No matter how eloquent you are, you won’t be able to leave! Since we dared to act, we will definitely see this through!"

"Exactly!" Yuan Shi stepped forward, staring at Shan Qingluo with a sinister gaze, "My lady, if you still cherish your life, please do not resist. Otherwise, it will be bad for everyone."

Shan Qingluo chuckled lightly, her eyes filled with disdain: "If I fight desperately, I can at least take three of you with me. Who wants to come?"

Several experts at the Divine Roaming Realm frowned, their expressions filled with dread.

It was precisely because they feared Shan Qingluo would fight desperately that, even though they had surrounded her, no one dared to act rashly.

A dead camel is still bigger than a horse; even a rotten boat has three nails. After all, she was the Enchantress Queen, not an ordinary expert!

"So it turns out... you all can't protect yourselves either!" Qiu Yimeng looked curiously at Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo, an inexplicable glimmer of pleasure flashing in her eyes.

But then... she recalled the terrifying strength this woman in red had displayed a few days ago. Why was she so vulnerable today?

Yet, as she thought of their current predicament, she couldn't help but let out a soft sigh.

Luo Xiaoman's eyes dimmed, completely losing her spirit, like dark clouds in the sky blocking out all light.

Originally, she could still place her hopes on Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo, but now that even they were surrounded, this outcome was beyond her expectations, turning her previous pleas into a joke.
