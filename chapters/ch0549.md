## Chapter 549 — Enough

The desperate battle raged on.

The losses suffered by the Seven Great Families coalition grew increasingly severe. Nine Blood Servants at the Divine Roaming Realm, Ninth Stage, each wielding the Blood Fury Technique, had become the greatest obstacle preventing them from defeating Yang Kai’s estate.

Time and time again, they clashed in fierce battles, yet still could not drive these nine back.

These nine Blood Servants paired off in teams of two, each pair able to restrain the entire force of one great family. The remaining Blood Servant, Ying Jiu, constantly guarded Yang Kai’s side, eliminating any enemy foolish enough to approach.

Ye Xinrou and Gao Rangfeng’s expressions changed.

This was because the Blood Servants’ use of the Blood Fury Technique this time lasted far longer than expected. According to their intelligence, this forbidden technique of the Yang Family’s Blood Servants can only be sustained for at most half an hour.

But that time had long since passed, and yet the nine Blood Servants showed no sign of Qi and blood depletion; instead, they grew fiercer with each battle.

Only now did everyone realize that the Yang Family’s position at the top of the Eight Great Families for so many years was truly no accident.

Though the strong cultivators of the Seven Great Families coalition also came from prestigious clans, they were helpless against these nine Blood Servants—this made them both anxious and furious.

Within the battlefield, Yang Kai kept a constant watch on the situation.

Though these nine Blood Servants were ferocious and Earth Demon fought tenaciously, the number of Divine Roaming Realm experts on Yang Kai’s side was steadily decreasing. Such a decline could greatly influence the battle’s outcome.

Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya had yet to intervene, which Yang Kai understood—once they took action, things might spiral out of control.

Besides these two top experts, War City held others of great strength.

Yang Kai was also against them acting now; they served better as a deterrent.

No one knew how this battle would end without fighting to the last.

From the side, a pure white figure suddenly flashed forward. Yang Kai sensed a familiar, comforting aura and quickly withdrew to meet her.

Turning his head, he saw Su Yan rushing out.

“Qiu Yimeng is fine, resting now,” Su Yan said softly.

Yang Kai nodded.

“I’ll help you.”

“Good!”

Su Yan had originally not intended to join this battle, but faced with overwhelming numbers and Yang Kai’s clear declaration that this was no longer a Succession War, she could not remain idle. After settling Qiu Yimeng, she came to reinforce the fight immediately.

Along with her came the Four Elders of Lingxiao Pavilion. These four were also formidable, and their entrance immediately secured local advantages for their side.

Su Yan took out the Mystery-Grade, Middle-Level mirror Secret Treasure. The bitter cold instantly spread, as True Yuan poured into it. Towering, snow-white mountains appeared faintly on the mirror’s surface. Inside was a world draped in silver, exuding bone-chilling cold.

Light burst forth, and suddenly a vast barrier formed, enveloping over a dozen strong cultivators from the Seven Great Families within it.

Kang Zhan’s eyes trembled with fear as he exclaimed, “It’s that Secret Treasure!”

A dozen days ago, four peak Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Nan and Xiang Families had been trapped and frozen like ice sculptures by this very Secret Treasure. Seeing this again stirred terror within Kang Zhan.

“What’s so special about this Secret Treasure?” Ye Xinrou urgently asked.

Kang Zhan’s expression grew grave as he recounted all he knew.

As she listened, Ye Xinrou’s delicate face changed color. Nearby, Gao Rangfeng and Meng Shanyi likewise appeared solemn.

Who among them could break such a powerful Secret Treasure?

Suddenly the barrier surrounding the earth shattered, and two figures stepped out. Everyone gazed and unsurprisingly saw Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Those previously trapped inside remained frozen as ice sculptures, standing silently in twisted postures, their lives uncertain.

This had all happened in less than the time it takes to drink half a cup of tea.

But it wasn’t over. Su Yan again poured True Yuan into the mirror, and with a terrifying spectacle, another barrier formed.

Once again, more than a dozen people were trapped inside.

“Impossible!” Ye Xinrou screamed, “That Secret Treasure consumes immense True Yuan; even she — a Divine Roaming Realm expert — cannot use it twice in a row!”

By herself, Su Yan could not have used it twice consecutively. Doing so would deplete all her True Yuan, leaving her vulnerable inside the barrier, captured by enemies even if they were frozen.

But beside her was Yang Kai. The two practiced the Dual Cultivation Technique, their True Yuan continuously circulating between them, providing an endless source. Such a level of consumption was bearable for Su Yan.

An uneasy chill rose in Ye Xinrou’s heart.

With just this single mysterious-grade Secret Treasure, Yang Kai and Su Yan had eliminated most of their opponents. If she unleashed it several more times, who would remain on their side?

Just as she panicked, the barrier shattered a second time, freezing another dozen or so.

Light flared again, catching more of the unprepared Seven Great Families cultivators in its grasp for a third time.

Ye Xinrou’s face grew pale in terror. She desperately considered strategies, but none came to mind that could effectively counter this.

For the first time, she felt a deep helplessness. She could not help but think how fortunate it would be if the Second Young Master were here. With his temperament and methods, he might find a way to counter this tactic.

Though crude and simple, this move was devastatingly effective—at least for the Seven Great Families coalition.

“Enough!” A fierce roar suddenly burst from the void, brimming with overwhelming authority. Those who heard it all involuntarily stopped their actions.

From where the oppressive force radiated, the crowd saw a huge, semi-real palm imprint appear in the air.

The massive hand slowly slammed down toward the barrier Su Yan had formed with the Secret Treasure.

Crash.

The palm struck the barrier, causing tremors that shook the ground and mountains alike, making everyone lose their footing.

With a crisp cracking sound, the supposedly impenetrable barrier shattered like a broken mirror, fragments scattering to reveal the trapped figures.

Yang Kai and Su Yan each grunted as their faces turned pale.

The mirror Secret Treasure was jointly owned by the two, melted and refined by Yang Kai but currently wielded by Su Yan. The barrier’s forceful destruction caused damage to both.

Those previously trapped regarded this as a near-death escape and quickly fled without looking back.

They had no desire to be frozen into ice sculptures themselves.

Seeing this, Ye Xinrou’s face brightened with hope, while Gao Rangfeng, Kang Zhan, and others gaped and stared into the air.

Eight figures appeared simultaneously, the eight otherworldly beings beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, who had always guarded the Fengshen Hall.

Their eyes fixed on Su Yan and Yang Kai with mixed emotions—astonishment, shock, and fear.

Yang Kai quietly looked up at them with a cold stare.

Their arrival was both expected and unexpected.

One among them slowly withdrew a raised hand—the origin of the huge palm imprint.

Yang Kai cast a sharp glance their way and suddenly recalled: this was the top expert who previously disliked him.

“Ancestor!” Ye Xinrou exclaimed joyfully.

That person nodded slightly in acknowledgement.

Gao Rangfeng, Kang Zhan, and Meng Shanyi quickly bowed in respect.

After more than ten days, these eight beings beyond the Divine Roaming Realm appeared once again. Their purpose was obvious, and it calmed the hearts of the others while also bringing a measure of shame.

If the Seven Great Families coalition could have crushed Yang Kai’s estate, they would not have forced these eight to appear. They must have realized that with their current strength, they were incapable of overcoming Yang Kai’s estate and were thus compelled to intervene.

This was also due to Ye Xinrou’s inadequate deployment, which had brought about this dire situation.

“The Yang Family brat,” the square-faced master beyond the Divine Roaming Realm said sternly to Yang Kai, “Last time, we did not cripple you on the spot out of respect for your status as a Zhongdu native, giving you a chance to change your ways. Yet now, not only do you show no remorse, you have grown more reckless, allowing your subordinates to kill strong cultivators of the Eight Great Families. Do you intend to rebel?”

Yang Kai took a deep breath, calming the surging Qi and blood within, then said loudly, “The blade is at my neck. Should I accept my death or resist? If it were you, Senior, what would you do?”

“If you had done nothing wrong, why would the Eight Great Families treat you like this? Why would the Yang Family ignore you? Foolish and stubbornly blind,” the man retorted.

“I don’t believe I am at fault,” Yang Kai replied coldly. “If you fear I might become an Evil Lord someday, I will forgo this Succession War and stop striving to be head of the Yang Family. Then you need not worry.”

“The Eight Great Families will not tolerate a disgrace like you. Your existence stains both the Yang Family and the Eight Great Families,” the man barked.

“In the end, you want me to submit,” Yang Kai sneered, “Sorry, but I have a rebellious streak. I respond better to soft words than force. If you negotiate, we can talk. If you insist on forcing things, then we fight to the death. No one walks away pleased.”

“Impudent!” the square-faced expert snapped coldly. “You lack the right. Today, no one can save you!”

“My brother, you're well past your prime, and yet here you are sparring heatedly with one so much younger. Is this fitting?” A light voice suddenly echoed as two figures flew out from Yang Kai’s mansion.

It was Meng Wuya and Ling Taixu.

Meng Wuya smiled calmly. “This is a child’s quarrel. Best we not intervene.”

“Meng Wuya!” The square-faced man stared deeply at Shopkeeper Meng, expression unchanged, as if he had long anticipated their arrival. “I do not know what secrets you hide, but you alone lack the qualification to hinder the Eight Great Families’ actions.”

When Yang Kai last ascended to the Divine Roaming Realm, the Eight Great Families’ experts had been stirred once before. At that time, they had not attacked Yang Kai because the situation was not yet beyond control and because Yang Kai was still somewhat within their grasp, making it unnecessary to openly fight. Another reason had been the presence of Meng Wuya and Ling Taixu by Yang Kai’s side.
