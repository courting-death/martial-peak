## Chapter 1635 — You Want to Do What

After searching tirelessly and finding nothing, fate handed this key figure—whom the Fire Radiance Sect had spent a year seeking—straight to one of its own disciples by accident; Yan Chilei felt a burst of joy in his heart.

In that instant he finally understood why Yu Xueqing had mobilized forces and launched a frantic assault days earlier to draw the Fire Radiance Sect's attention.

Clearly, it was a diversion to conceal the real plan!

Moreover, judging from the direction this group had come from, it was indeed the route back to Icebound Island.

“So that's it!” Yan Chilei nodded slightly, turned to Yu Xueqing and said, “So this was your aim. Too bad—since you've run into me, Yan will see to it that you fail!”

Yu Xueqing felt a cold alarm in her heart, shot Yang Kai a glare for being talkative and asking for trouble, then hissed under her breath, “What are you standing there for? Move! No matter what, get this brat to Icebound Island!”

As she finished speaking, Yu Xueqing poured her Saint Yuan into motion; a chill visible to the naked eye radiated out from her position and rapidly spread in all directions.

The cold seemed capable of freezing heaven and earth; the ground was immediately covered with a thick layer of ice.

Sss sss sss……

Ice spikes suddenly materialized behind Yu Xueqing, sharp and glittering with an icy gleam. With a flick of her hand, countless ice cones surged forward like a plague of locusts toward the Fire Radiance Sect warriors.

“I’ve long heard of the Thirteenth Elder’s great name! I, Yan Chilei, have come to keep you company—let’s hope you don’t disappoint me!” Yan Chilei shouted fiercely. Facing the countless ice spikes before him, he showed not a trace of fear and suddenly thrust a punch forward.

An explosion rang out as scorching profound intent splashed the void. A gigantic fist formed of flame met those ice cones head-on.

Boom boom boom……

Numerous ice cones shattered. The flame fist gradually diminished and finally dissolved into nothing.

“Brother Jiang, do as you please with the others—whether they live or die is up to you, but that brat must be captured alive!” Yan Chilei shattered Yu Xueqing’s attack with a single move and closed on her at tremendous speed, shouting the warning.

“Heh heh heh… with you saying that, this old man can rest easy!” Jiang Xi sneered and set his poison arts in motion.

In an instant, a multicolored poisonous mist shrouded the ten-li area, like an inverted bowl covering the land tightly. A foul stench filled the space, making one feel sick; every woman from Ice Heart Valley who inhaled it felt dizzy and faint—their Saint Yuan could no longer be regulated properly.

“Not good—it's Jiang Xi's annihilating poisonous mist!” someone from Ice Heart Valley cried out in alarm.

“No matter what, get the brat out first!” another followed Yu Xueqing's orders and urged the others.

The Ice Heart Valley women snapped back to their senses.

For over a year, at least a thousand fellow disciples had died searching outside for Yang Kai. They had suffered so much just to find him; if he were taken here, those thousand would have died in vain.

“Come with us!” a woman dressed like a young matron shouted lowly to Yang Kai.

Yu Xueqing was tied up with Yan Chilei, and the others formed their defense around him.

“Think we can get away?” Yang Kai looked at her and slowly shook his head. “That old man's strength surpasses all of yours, and this poisonous mist seems no small matter either. If you really try to run, you’ll just end up being toyed to death.”

“Don't talk so much—if we say run, then run!” the young matron woman snapped through clenched teeth. “This man is strong; we simply can't resist!”

“Strong? How strong?” Yang Kai's expression did not change.

“Peak Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm! On Chi Lan Star he was one of the best prospects to advance to the Void King Realm. In our Ice Heart Valley only the top five elders could contend with him—don't be reckless.”

“So he is strong,” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“You…” The young matron's anger flared; she was furious at Yang Kai's indifferent attitude. She had made the situation sound so dire, and the man showed no concern at all—was he trying to drag them all down to doom?

“We've already missed the best chance!” another woman nearby said gloomily.

Hearing that, the young matron sighed.

If they had acted the instant the Thirteen Elders issued the warning, escape might still have been possible; but with Yang Kai dawdling like this, there was no chance of survival.

Jiang Xi loathed Ice Heart Valley deeply; his strength was great and his toxic arts were extraordinarily tricky and hard to guard against. The fate of her senior sisters looked grim.

Thinking that, the young matron glared viciously at Yang Kai and ground her teeth, “If we die, it's because of you. Even in the netherworld I won't let you off.”

“Why make such a big deal of it?” Yang Kai remained unconcerned. “We just need to kill him.”

The young matron froze. The Ice Heart Valley women all looked at Yang Kai as if he were a fool—men were indeed foolish creatures. Didn't he realize the gap between him and Jiang Xi? How could he speak so brazenly?

While they dithered, Jiang Xi's body became enveloped in the same multicolored poisonous mist, hiding his form. Only a chilling, monstrous laugh echoed from within the fog.

“Follow me up,” Jiang Xi said in a low, sinister voice. “But remember this—don’t kill a single one of them. These cheap sluts from Ice Heart Valley all belong to me! I’ll make them understand what it truly means not to judge a man by his appearance!”

Several Fire Radiance Sect warriors rolled their eyes in unison, but outmatched, they could only nod and comply, following Jiang Xi. Their Saint Yuan flamed like blazing fire as they charged the Ice Heart Valley women.

“They're coming! We have greater numbers—hold the line, and be especially wary of Jiang Xi's toxic mist!” the lead young matron cried. Nearly ten Ice Heart Valley women poured their Saint Yuan, pushing their cold to the extreme.

She glanced at Yang Kai and ordered, “Hide behind us… hey, what are you doing?!”

As she spoke, she saw Yang Kai take a step forward and stride directly toward Jiang Xi and the others as if courting death.

“Get back!” the young matron cried in alarm.

On the other side, Yu Xueqing—locked in a tit-for-tat with Yan Chilei—noticed the disturbance and turned her head, her face paling.

The moment of distraction allowed Yan Chilei to seize the upper hand. She was forced onto the defensive and cursed Yang Kai for his rashness.

She knew it was over.

Not only could she not bring Yang Kai back to Ice Heart Valley, those dozen or so disciples would likely not live to return; as for her own chance of escape, it was only around thirty percent. Yu Xueqing's heart burned with worry, but she was helpless.

“This brat is interesting! Well, Elder Yan said not to kill him, so he must be taken alive—what a nuisance!” Jiang Xi looked at the rapidly approaching Yang Kai, gestured, and a wisp of poisonous mist separated from his body and streaked toward Yang Kai.

In the blink of an eye the wisp attacked, twisting and writhing like a rope as it sought to bind Yang Kai and capture him alive.

“Not good!” The young matron’s heart sank, almost unable to bear watching what was about to happen, torn between anxiety and helpless anger.

If Yang Kai hadn't dawdled and acted hastily, they might at least have completed the task—even if some had to die, it would have been worth it. Now, everything was ruined.

The poisonous smoke, as if alive, coiled and bound Yang Kai's body.

“This brat may be useful to your Fire Radiance Sect—take him!” Jiang Xi commanded without a glance at Yang Kai and sped past him toward the nearby young matron and her group.

The Fire Radiance Sect men exchanged looks; one charged at Yang Kai while the others continued to follow Jiang Xi.

A squad of seven or eight brushed past Yang Kai.

Golden light flared!

Blood spattered and severed limbs flew……

Several lives were extinguished in an instant!

Corpses and gore rained down like a storm—an utterly gruesome scene.

Sensing the energy fluctuation from behind, Jiang Xi frowned and turned suspiciously to look.

The next moment his eyes widened and he spun around, his face turning grave as he stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

The poisonous smoke that had bound the brat had, for unknown reasons, dissipated; and every Fire Radiance Sect warrior trailing Jiang was gone—every one dead!

There had been no sound of battle, no dying screams—only a momentary ripple of energy, and six or seven Origin Returning Realm cultivators were dead for no apparent reason.

A chill ran from Jiang Xi's head to his toes as he realized something was dreadfully wrong.

On the Ice Heart Valley side, the women were stunned; the leading young matron trembled and stood as if in a dream.

Qing Ya's beautiful eyes shone with a strange light; she wore an expression meaning, as she thought, "So it is."

Yang Kai refused to flee and instead actively met the enemy; she had already formed some suspicions.

She didn't know Yang Kai well, but from Su Yan she had heard that Yang Kai was someone who often produced miracles and routinely took on challenges above his level.

Before she had only suspected it—now the fact lay plainly before her.

Those six or seven Fire Radiance Sect men ranged from First to Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, yet as they brushed past Yang Kai they all inexplicably died.

This could no longer be explained by a mere out‑of‑level fight; it was a miracle.

No one knew how Yang Kai had done it—they only saw a strand of golden light bloom.

“Impossible!” The young matron stared at Yang Kai in shock. Before Yang Kai hung a strand of golden thread, eerily full of vitality and the power of qi and blood, as if it possessed its own life—not to be underestimated.

A faint smile played on his face as he looked at Jiang Xi with a hint of mockery.

Jiang inexplicably felt immense pressure as if he faced not a Second Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivator but a genuine Void King Realm practitioner!

With a shift of Divine Sense, Jiang Xi dispelled his unease and growled in a low voice, “You brat dare put on a show?”

“You simply underestimated me,” Yang Kai grinned and replied calmly, “Old man, are you prepared to die?”

“What arrogance!” Jiang roared, his Shi surging out in a fan to press down on Yang Kai.
