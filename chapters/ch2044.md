## Chapter 2044 — Primordial Cauldron Mountain

Two days later, Yang Kai was in his cave dwelling refining several newly acquired Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasures when his expression suddenly shifted; he took out a Transmission Compass from his Spatial Ring, poured his Divine Sense into it, his eyes brightening at once, and he hurriedly rose to his feet.

After a moment, he calmly left the cave and headed straight for the city gate.

Half an hour later, in a small grove about thirty thousand li from Fenglin City, Yang Kai descended from high above.

Before he could inspect his surroundings, a familiar figure appeared ahead of him, chuckled, clasped his fist and said, "Brother Yang, you were fast."

"Brother Kang, sorry to have kept you waiting." Yang Kai smiled back and returned the salute.

The man before him was, of course, Kang Siran. When Yang Kai had received his earlier transmission he had immediately known the other was fully prepared; they had not left Fenglin City together but set out separately and rendezvoused here.

Kang Siran was cautious by nature, which suited Yang Kai just fine.

"Not at all — I only just arrived and haven't even caught my breath yet, Brother Yang, and here you are," Kang Siran said with a smile. "Since Brother Yang is already here, there's no time to lose; let's set off at once."

As he spoke, he opened his mouth and spat out a Secret Treasure shaped like a long shuttle; it unfolded in the wind into a shuttle-shaped object about three zhang long.

Kang Siran made a few hand seals and sent Origin Qi forward; an opening immediately appeared on the Secret Treasure.

Yang Kai saw this and realized it was a flying Secret Treasure as well; without hesitation he slipped inside, and when Kang Siran entered and exerted control, the long shuttle shot forward at great speed.

"Don't laugh at me, Brother Yang—my flying Secret Treasure is only a Void King-Grade Middle-Level, not very fast, but it conserves power. It's better than the two of us walking the whole way," Kang Siran said while guiding the treasure.

Yang Kai nodded and said, "That's sufficient. I was wondering how long the journey will take."

"About three days," Kang Siran replied. "I'll tell you about the situation there on the way."

"I was just about to ask," Yang Kai answered.

The two chatted inside the treasure. After Kang Siran's account, Yang Kai learned that the grotto belonging to Great Emperor Miaodan's Third Brother, Gongsun Mu, was located at a place called Primordial Cauldron Mountain.

From afar, this peak resembled a massive ritual cauldron, which was why the locals had come to call it Primordial Cauldron Mountain.

Primordial Cauldron Mountain lay within the sphere of influence of Blazing Fire Hall. Years ago Kang Siran had secretly explored there alone, but at that time his strength was insufficient to break the grotto's bindings, and he left in disappointment.

By his estimate then, even if the grotto's seals had decayed over the years, a Void King Realm cultivator could not break them; at minimum a Dao Origin Realm practitioner would be needed.

That was why he had to invite Yang Kai to join him; with his current strength alone he would be powerless.

One reason Kang Siran invited Yang Kai was that Gongsun Mu was adept at pill refinement and his grotto would be a tremendous attraction for Yang Kai, so he would hardly refuse. The other reason was that the days spent interacting with Yang Kai had convinced Kang Siran he was trustworthy.

Otherwise, Kang Siran would not have rashly invited a stranger to cooperate on such a major matter.

Even close friends and family had been known to turn on one another when enormous interests were at stake.

"Brother Kang, since Primordial Cauldron Mountain lies within Blazing Fire Hall's territory, we'll have to act carefully; if Blazing Fire Hall discovers us it will be troublesome," Yang Kai said, frowning.

Although Yang Kai had not spent long in Fenglin City, he had heard much about Blazing Fire Hall.

The forces around Fenglin City were such that only Blazing Fire Hall could rival the City Lord's mansion. The strongest in Fenglin City was City Lord Duan Yuanshan, who possessed the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and within Blazing Fire Hall there had likewise been a Hall Master surnamed Luo at the same Second Stage.

Unfortunately, that Hall Master Luo had been consumed by the world-ending black flame of the Ancient Divine Spirit Luanfeng on Yuqing Mountain.

Blazing Fire Hall's strength should thus have been greatly diminished.

"Rest assured, Brother Yang," Kang Siran smiled. "I had a friend look into it. Blazing Fire Hall is currently preoccupied and has little time to deal with us."

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Kang Siran said, "You should have heard that the original Hall Master Luo perished on Yuqing Mountain, right?"

Yang Kai nodded. He thought to himself that he had not only heard but had been present; if not for having the Xuan Realm Pearl to hide in, he would surely have perished alongside the Hall Master Luo.

"With the Hall Master Luo's fall, Blazing Fire Hall has become fractured. The two remaining deputy Hall Masters are busy vying for power."

"Is that information reliable?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Naturally it's reliable," Kang Siran said with a slight smile. "Besides their internal power struggle, Primordial Cauldron Mountain itself sits at the edge of Blazing Fire Hall's territory and is extremely desolate. When I explored it years ago I saw not a single soul. So don't worry too much—if we act cautiously this time, no one will notice."

"That's for the best," Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction.

The two did not dwell on the matter further and instead chatted casually.

Both men were Third Stage of the Void King Realm and were preparing to break the Dao Origin Realm bottleneck; they naturally had many topics in common, and they spent the journey exchanging cultivation experiences and their understandings of the Dao Origin Realm and the Power of the Laws, so time passed swiftly.

During the trip they took turns guiding the long shuttle so each could recover some strength.

Three days later, a cauldron-shaped peak entered their view.

"Is that Primordial Cauldron Mountain?" Yang Kai asked, looking up.

"Yes," Kang Siran answered, his gaze reflecting a flicker of ardor as if he deeply longed for the mountain ahead.

Inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda he had failed to obtain a Dao Origin Fruit, and at the auction he lacked the funds to bid. Now his hopes of advancing to the Dao Origin Realm rested entirely on Gongsun Mu's grotto; naturally he greatly anticipated that the grotto might contain already-refined Dao Origin Pills.

Suddenly Kang Siran frowned and fixed his Divine Sense toward the front.

At the same time Yang Kai eyed the scene warily and said, "That's not right, Shopkeeper Kang—it's not as you described; it looks rather lively over there."

With Yang Kai's eyesight, even from several hundred li away he could see numerous figures bustling about, and now and then a beam of light flew up and down, giving the place a lively air.

Kang Siran's face darkened and he immediately stood up.

At that moment a rainbow light flew toward them; within the light a figure stood indistinctly and came straight at them.

Kang Siran's expression changed and he hastily stopped his flying Secret Treasure.

Moments later the rainbow light drew near, its brilliance fading to reveal a man who looked to be about thirty years old, a Second Stage of the Void King Realm cultivator whose garments bore a glaring emblem of blazing fire on the chest.

"A disciple of Blazing Fire Hall!" Kang Siran exclaimed and glanced at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, motioning for calm.

At that moment the Blazing Fire Hall disciple shouted, "This area falls within the sphere of Blazing Fire Hall. Friends inside the shuttle, please show yourselves."

Kang Siran frowned, pondered briefly, signaled to Yang Kai, and then both of them revealed their forms.

The disciple swept his Divine Sense over them and discovered that both Kang Siran and Yang Kai were a stage higher than himself. He showed no alarm, however, and instead clasped his fist and said, "May I ask if you two came for Primordial Cauldron Mountain?"

Kang Siran's heart skipped a beat and he nearly thought their covert action had been exposed, momentarily unsure how to reply.

Fortunately Yang Kai answered at once, "Yes."

"If you came for Primordial Cauldron Mountain, then follow me," the disciple said, showing no surprise as he waved them onward and led the way toward Primordial Cauldron Mountain.

Kang Siran and Yang Kai exchanged puzzled looks.

But with events set in motion they decided to go along and see how matters unfolded.

Kang Siran withdrew his long shuttle, and he and Yang Kai trailed the Blazing Fire Hall disciple as they sped toward Primordial Cauldron Mountain.

In a short while they covered the three hundred li.

Before the trio had a chance to land, a humming roar issued from within Primordial Cauldron Mountain, as if dull thunder rolled through the mountain, deafening in its intensity.

Kang Siran and Yang Kai's faces changed in unison, and they instinctively activated their internal power to guard against the unexpected.

The leading Blazing Fire Hall disciple, however, appeared entirely unperturbed; he stopped and instead looked up with interest.

Following his gaze, Yang Kai also looked up.

The rolling thunder continued from below and upward, as if something inside Primordial Cauldron Mountain was about to burst forth.

A moment later, a resounding boom erupted.

From the mountain peak a sweep of five-colored radiance shot forth, solid and tangible; the glow spread outward in ripple-like rings and then gradually faded away.

At the same time Yang Kai involuntarily inhaled sharply, his face showing astonishment.

"It smells so fragrant—what is that?" Kang Siran's expression shifted; he too drew in a deep breath, for the air carried a rich, unusual aroma that cleared the mind.

The Blazing Fire Hall disciple heard this, glanced back at Kang Siran and said, "Weren't you two drawn here by that phenomenon?"

Yang Kai turned his eyes and immediately replied, "Exactly; we didn't know what the phenomenon was, so we wanted to get closer to take a look."

The disciple chuckled, “Heh heh — what exactly caused this portent, I don’t know myself. I only heard Hall Master Zong and Hall Master Lian say it’s likely a sign that an extraordinary treasure is about to be born.”
