## Chapter 738 — Imposing Momentum

When practicing the Dual Cultivation Technique, the two partners can not only merge and converge their True Yuan, producing earth-shaking transformations, but even their Divine Sense can undergo the same intermingling.

While experiencing a near-screaming ecstasy, Su Yan felt wave after wave of profound, mysterious energy transmitted from Yang Kai's Spirit Body.

All of Yang Kai's insights into the Heavenly Dao and the martial path were being shared with her.

Su Yan did not dare be negligent; she opened her heart to accept them, the memories sinking deep into her soul.

Yang Kai's spirit likewise benefited greatly. Although Su Yan's insights no longer held much use for him, through this fusion he keenly perceived his spirit rapidly solidifying, and his Divine Sense energy becoming more refined.

In the ice chamber their spirits met, and their True Yuan involuntarily burst forth, merging and exchanging, flowing along the incantation path of the Dual Cultivation Technique through each other's bodies.

Each time it flowed, the True Yuan grew a degree purer.

This session of dual cultivation granted both of them unimaginably great benefits.

Suddenly, behind Yang Kai a phantom of a giant dragon coalesced, and at the same time a phantom of an ice phoenix rippled across Su Yan's body.

The two phantoms absorbed their True Yuan and swelled rapidly; within moments they filled the entire ice chamber.

The dragon's high-pitched roar resounded, answered by the phoenix's clear cry; the Three-Thousand Glacier World trembled, the ice prisms hanging beneath the peaks turned to dust in an instant, and chunks of ice sifted down.

Boom — two terrifying energies of completely opposite attributes erupted from within the ice mountain and shot straight into the sky.

From the Ice Sect's Ice Lord Qing Ya down to the ordinary disciples, all were alarmed, faces changing as they burst out of their ice mountain dwellings.

Qian Yue was startled as well; she had been meditating in her own ice mountain, felt the unusual energy fluctuations, and hurried out to see.

As far as the eye could see, the sect's other three elders stood in the void, faces grave as they looked up, eyes trembling.

Even Ice Lord Qing Ya's pretty face had turned solemn.

"Sect Lord!" Qian Yue hurried over and called, but received no response; following their gaze, her beautiful eyes narrowed.

In the sky a giant dragon over a hundred zhang long, its body blazing with golden radiance like roaring flames, swayed majestically; beside it a vast ice phoenix, crystalline and resplendent in ice-blue, spread its wings and danced.

Dragon and phoenix chased and frolicked, their presence immense.

From them everyone felt scorching heat and biting cold; such heat and chill none present could underestimate.

What shocked Qing Ya and the others most was that two somewhat familiar auras emanated from the golden dragon and the ice phoenix.

They were the auras of Yang Kai and Su Yan!

Just as everyone was stunned, the frolicking dragon and phoenix suddenly changed direction and flew straight toward Qing Ya and the others.

Several elders of the Saint Realm flushed and quickly condensed their True Yuan, bracing themselves.

The golden dragon and ice phoenix flew to a point a hundred zhang before them and slowly stopped, the dragon ahead and the phoenix behind, intimate as if husband and wife.

The dragon's two eyes, the size of bronze gongs, fixed on them and appraised Qing Ya and the others with lively interest, bearing a strangely humanized quality; everyone involuntarily grew tense, feeling inconceivably small, as if they could be wiped out at any moment.

Especially Qian Yue; she felt that when the dragon stared at her there was a strong warning in its gaze.

Qing Ya frowned, circulated her True Yuan to resist the oppressive aura from the dragon and phoenix, and tentatively asked, "Yang Kai?"

A flash of surprise crossed the dragon's eyes, and it abruptly turned and sped away with the phoenix.

Amid the high dragon roars and clear phoenix cries the pair receded until they vanished from sight.

Only after they departed did everyone in the Ice Sect involuntarily exhale; a cold wind blew and they found cold sweat on their backs.

Watching the dragon and phoenix's departing forms, Qing Ya fell into thought.

She could sense that they had not simply left, but seemed intent on roaming and playing through this glacier world.

Sure enough, after a short while distant rumblings could be heard, evidently caused by that dragon and phoenix's mischief.

Qing Ya shook her head and smiled wryly, waving, "Go back, it's all right now."

"Sect Lord, could this really be that brat's doing?" Qian Hao asked with a furrowed brow, uncertain; when the dragon and phoenix first appeared they had been above the ice mountain where Yang Kai and Su Yan were, yet with the two youngsters' strength, how could they have produced such an enormous spectacle?

"Probably," Qing Ya smiled faintly. "They will return."

"They will return?" Qian Hao's expression changed.

"Didn't you notice? The two children's spirits and consciousness are inside that dragon and phoenix; those forms were manifested by their gathered True Yuan. Their bodies are still in my Ice Sect — where else would they go?"

"So he woke Su Yan?" Qian Yue cried, delighted.

"Not sure. Wait until they return and ask," Qing Ya said, pursing her lips in a smile.

"That brat is infuriating — making such a commotion to warn my Ice Sect not to mistreat Su Yan?" Qian Yue ground her teeth, thinking of the warning look the golden dragon had given her and growing furious.

"But Sect Lord, at their cultivation levels their bodies couldn't possibly store such vast True Yuan, right?" Qian Hao looked baffled. "If, as Qing Ya says, the dragon and phoenix were manifested by Yang Kai and Su Yan's True Yuan, how much True Yuan would that have consumed? Do their bodies hold that much?"

Su Yan could perhaps manage it — cultivating ice-method incantations, if her True Yuan within was insufficient she could draw in ice-element energy from the surroundings.

But how did Yang Kai accomplish it?

Unable to fathom it, Qian Hao shook his head again and again.

Far off amid the dragon and phoenix's chase, Yang Kai and Su Yan's consciousnesses continued to communicate.

In recent dual cultivations, every time a dragon-and-phoenix auspice seemed to appear, yet Yang Kai and Su Yan had never before imagined their spirits could take command of such dragon and phoenix forms.

This time, because their spirits were merging, they effortlessly achieved that grand feat.

The accidental discovery made Yang Kai realize that the dragon-and-phoenix pattern imprinted on him and Su Yan was not merely a design; it hid a vast energy that could even be converted into an unimaginably powerful Soul Technique.

By deliberately appearing before the Ice Sect's people, Yang Kai's intention was indeed as Qian Yue guessed — to intimidate and warn them not to meddle in Su Yan's affairs in the future, lest more well-intentioned mistakes occur.

Su Yan felt somewhat guilty about it and reproached Yang Kai twice, saying he shouldn't have acted so.

They continued to fly and chase while exchanging thoughts.

In their dragon and phoenix incarnations the world looked very different, as if the whole heaven and earth were under their control, and their states of mind were subtly elevated.

At one point Yang Kai halted, staring blankly at a towering ice mountain ahead; he sensed there was something within that ice mountain of immense energy.

Under normal circumstances, even with his Divine Sense cultivation he could not have detected it, but now with his spirit inhabiting the golden dragon his senses were exceptionally keen.

Su Yan had obviously noticed too; she hovered beside Yang Kai, staring, and conveyed by mind: "I've heard that inside some ancient ice mountains rare heaven-and-earth treasures can form. Ice Lord once obtained some, and Elders Qian Hao and Qian Yue have as well. Could that mountain contain such things?"

"What is it?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

"A Cold-Ice Jade Crystal — a Saint-Grade material that greatly aids cultivation of ice techniques."

Yang Kai's spirit stirred. "If there is one, we'll know when we look."

As he spoke, the golden dragon's radiant body charged straight at the ice mountain, emanating heat capable of melting everything.

Boom...

The ice mountain shuddered; the ancient massif split open with countless cracks like a spiderweb spreading across the entire body.

Though the mountain was wounded, its solidity still surpassed Yang Kai's imagination and it did not collapse.

Su Yan said nothing, hovering beside Yang Kai; their eyes met and everything passed between them unspoken.

In the next instant both exerted force, and the golden dragon and ice phoenix vanished like lightning.

Their combined might was several times the destructive power Yang Kai could produce alone.

Without a sound, Yang Kai and Su Yan had already passed through the mountain and arrived on the far side.

Waiting silently a moment, a thunderous roar followed as the great towering ice mountain crumbled.

As the mountain shattered, the energy fluctuation Yang Kai had sensed grew ever clearer.

But before he could search, a sudden dizziness overcame him and deep in his spirit a strong weariness arose.

He was not the only one; Su Yan seemed likewise, the ice phoenix form fluctuating and on the verge of collapse.

"Junior Brother, I think I'm a bit tired!"

"Let's return first," Yang Kai hastened. This was their first time placing their spirits into dragon and phoenix bodies; some maladjustment was inevitable. At such times they must first return to their flesh to recuperate, lest their spirits suffer damage.

Hearing this, Su Yan nodded gently and the two hurried back.

After a brief calm, the Ice Sect stirred once more as two vast energy fluctuations drew near; sure enough, the golden dragon and ice phoenix returned, moving hastily and flashing into an ice mountain where they disappeared.

Staring at the place where they had vanished, Qing Ya shook her head and smiled wryly, "It must be them, those two children... Qian Yue, come with me and take a look."

"Mm." Qian Yue promptly replied.
