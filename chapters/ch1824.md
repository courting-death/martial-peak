## Chapter 1824 — I'll Give You Two Choices

"You bastard, I'll kill you!" Mu Wu roared, his face contorting with fury; Saint Yuan surged around him as his Domain of the Void King Realm erupted forth, enveloping Yang Kai, while his body became a streak of light that descended directly above Yang Kai's head.

He knew perfectly well the cultivation of the people from Tianmu Palace; there was no way his son had been killed by them. The only possibility was that the youngster before him had suppressed and then murdered him.

A father's hatred for a murdered son left no room for compromise! Even though Mu Wu feared Yang Kai's strength, how could he stand it now?

He slapped his hands together and shoved forward; a surging force took shape into a visible cross-shaped slash, descending like an avalanche and a tidal wave, as if to cleave Yang Kai in two.

"Is that all you've got?" Yang Kai curled his mouth, a trace of disdain flashing across his face.

The moment Mu Wu made his move, Yang Kai saw through him; although Mu Wu was also of the First Stage of the Void King Realm, his true combat power was worse than any Void King Realm practitioner Yang Kai had encountered.

That gap lay mainly in the refinement of Saint Yuan and the power of the Domain Field.

It wasn't surprising — Devouring Spirit Sect cultivators boosted their strength mainly by refining and devouring Devouring Spirit Crystals, a shortcut. But the Martial Dao had no real shortcuts; rapid rises in cultivation came at the cost of an unstable foundation.

Devouring Spirit Sect cultivators might, with Devouring Spirit Crystals, reach the Second Stage or even the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, yet their real combat strength would be far lower than that of ordinary practitioners of the same rank.

Mu Wu was exactly that — his Saint Yuan was somewhat impure, and his Domain Field was imperfect.

Though that cross of energy carried tremendous force, to Yang Kai it was riddled with flaws.

He simply bent his waist, steadied his stance, and met the blow with a full-force punch.

The force of his punch roared forth, striking squarely at the very center of the cross-shaped energy slash.

Crackling sounds like brittle splinters rang out; Mu Wu's heart leapt, his eyes nearly bulged from their sockets as horror and utter disbelief contorted his face.

He felt his Domain Field be shattered to pieces beneath that single punch, unable to remain whole, and the cross-shaped energy slash likewise became fragile — it was directly blown apart.

Incredible! Mu Wu immediately realized Yang Kai was far beyond what he could withstand.

Before that thought had fully formed, the remaining fist force broke through every seal and slammed into his chest.

Pft... Mu Wu flew backwards, spitting a mouthful of blood.

"What?"

"The Sect Master actually..."

"Impossible. I must have been mistaken!"

The Origin Returning Realm cultivators of the Devouring Spirit Sect began clamoring, faces drained of blood, rubbing their eyes to see whether they'd just had an illusion.

Void King Realm experts had long been the top forces in this Star Domain, yet their Sect Master, a Void King Realm cultivator, had been knocked flying by this youth upon their first clash — such a reality was unbearable to accept.

Mu Wu trembled as well; after that strike the hot-blooded fervor that had filled his mind rapidly faded, and realizing he was no match for Yang Kai, he began to consider how to flee.

But then the world blurred, and an expression that filled him with terror suddenly appeared close enough to touch his nose.

"Demon Eye!" Yang Kai uttered softly, and in the next instant his left pupil contracted into a narrow vertical slit; a dazzling gold light burst from that eye, filled with inexorable majesty.

Mu Wu was instantly blinded; in his mind he felt a terrifying, oppressive eye in the sky staring coldly down at him, under that gaze he dared not move, even his soul trembled.

While he stood dazed, Yang Kai struck again.

A sudden punch slammed into Mu Wu's Dantian, torrents of Saint Yuan poured into his body like myriad blades tearing through his meridians and flesh, instantly ruining his channels.

The Void King Realm aura on Mu Wu's body wilted abruptly.

In barely three breaths' time, the Devouring Spirit Sect Sect Master had his cultivation annihilated by Yang Kai.

Slap... like a dead fish he plummeted from the sky and collapsed to the ground, motionless.

Thuds echoed from the planetary core as only the sound of the Devouring Spirit Sect Origin Returning Realm cultivators swallowing saliva remained; the battle had happened so fast they hadn't reacted before their Sect Master had been ruined.

Now understanding their predicament, each of them turned pale and looked at Yang Kai beside Mu Wu as if he were a demon, faces full of horror and dread.

If this youth could ruin their Sect Master within three breaths, killing them would likely be a mere flick of his fingers.

Yang Kai's left World-Ending Demon Eye had not yet faded; he bent and lifted Mu Wu, staring into his pupils as Divine Sense surged. In a low voice he said, "How is the Devouring Spirit Array configured? Tell me and I will spare your life!"

Although Yang Kai had seen a six-pointed star array before, he hadn't been able to divine its workings; his knowledge of arrays was shallow, so to learn the configuration he would have to get it from Mu Wu.

Mu Wu was the Devouring Spirit Sect's Sect Master; there was no reason he wouldn't know how the Devouring Spirit Array was arranged.

Stripped of his cultivation, how could Mu Wu resist the power of the World-Ending Demon Eye? Under Yang Kai's Divine Sense, his gaze went hollow and he answered, "The Devouring Spirit Array was given to the Mu family by that Master; he said it mustn't be told to anyone!"

"That Master?" Yang Kai frowned in surprise; he had only wanted to learn the array's operation and take it back to Dark Star for Yang Yan to study and possibly improve it, not expecting to be drawn into some mysterious 'Master.'

There seemed to be secrets afoot, Yang Kai thought.

A not-very-good feeling rose in him.

At that moment, a flicker of sharp light passed through the dazed Mu Wu's eyes and he shouted, "Master, save me!"

Yang Kai's expression changed; as he tried to step back the gleam shot from Mu Wu's eyes into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

"Bad!" Yang Kai cried, thrusting Mu Wu aside and closing his eyes as his spirit body manifested within his Sea of Consciousness.

Inside the Sea of Consciousness all seemed calm, but Yang Kai's gaze immediately fixed on an energy unlike the others.

That energy hung in his Sea of Consciousness, twisting and shifting, and from it Yang Kai sensed a completely unfamiliar aura — one that did not belong to Mu Wu.

The energy was not particularly powerful, yet Yang Kai felt unimaginable danger.

"Warm Spirit Lotus! It's actually a Warm Spirit Lotus!" a hoarse cry came from that energy; from the voice one could only tell it was a man, age indeterminate. As the voice faded the energy formed into the figure of a robed man.

His features were blurred and Yang Kai could not make them out.

The man stared straight at the Seven-Colored Treasure Isle in Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, a fanatical light faintly flaring from his eyes.

"Ha ha ha ha, it's a Warm Spirit Lotus that has evolved to Seven-Colored! One step further and it would be the Supreme Warm Spirit Lotus. I never expected such a heavenly treasure to exist in this Star Domain! It seems coming here at the cost of Yuan Qi was a fine idea!"

He seemed to ignore Yang Kai entirely, staring only at the Warm Spirit Lotus, greatly exhilarated.

Then his body trembled as he stared up into the Sea of Consciousness; his eyes flashed with even greater frenzy as he cried out, "A Star Chart — it's the Star Chart of this Star Domain! Ha ha ha, the heavens favor me!"

"Who are you? You're not Mu Wu, are you?" Yang Kai asked coldly; though the man felt dangerous, this was Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness and his realm, so he remained unconcerned.

The man cast Yang Kai a faint glance, his eyes indifferent.

Under that look Yang Kai had the sense of an ant being stared down by a great dragon, as if he were utterly insignificant to this man.

Yang Kai's heart jolted!

His Martial Dao will was exceptionally tenacious; he'd faced stronger foes before, and as a Void King Realm cultivator he shouldn't feel humbled even before a Third Stage Void King Realm opponent.

Yet this man...

Yang Kai forced down his discomfort and said coldly, "It seems you are the 'Master' Mu Wu mentioned."

The figure raised an eyebrow and smiled half-mockingly, "Young one, you're tender in years yet your cultivation is not low and your disposition is remarkable. To have someone like you in this Star Domain is unexpected. Give you time and you'll become great. Indeed, I am the Master Mu Wu spoke of."

"So you don't want Mu Wu to reveal the Devouring Spirit Array's secret, and have attached your Divine Sense to him so that when he tries to speak you'll appear to stop him?"

"A promising child!"

Yang Kai nodded slightly; from the brief exchanges and the man's mutterings he had a vague guess at his origin. After a moment he looked up and grinned, "Then tell me, Senior, have you ever heard the name Insect Emperor?"

At those words the man shook and his eyes flashed with terrifying light as he hissed, "A mere ant knows of the Insect Emperor? You are not simple."

"Heh, I see — you came from that place as well!"

"You know of the Star Realm?" the man stared incredulously at Yang Kai. "Who exactly are you?"

Now he finally faced Yang Kai seriously.

"So that's what they call it, the Star Realm..." Yang Kai said, a look of sudden understanding and a trace of yearning crossing his face.

"You don't know?" the man frowned, puzzled by Yang Kai's knowledge of the Insect Emperor yet ignorance of the Star Realm. Irritated, he waved his hand and said, "I don't care where you heard the Insect Emperor's name — since you have seen me, I cannot let you live. I’ll give you two choices—death, or surrender. Hand over the Warm Spirit Lotus with both hands, and perhaps I’ll consider sparing your life.”
