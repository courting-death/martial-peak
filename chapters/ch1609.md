## Chapter 1609 — Ridiculously Strong

“Why run?” Yang Kai stood there casually; at the words his brows lifted and he countered.

“Aren't you afraid of death? Aren't you afraid I will kill you?” Xue Lian said with an expression of keen interest.

“Who kills whom is still far from certain, Senior. Don’t you think you’re speaking a bit too soon?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

Xue Lian narrowed his eyes, studying Yang Kai intently for a moment before nodding slightly. “I don’t like to admit it, but you humans are proving to be more capable than several of our young yao. It seems my race has truly declined.”

“Senior flatters me,” Yang Kai replied calmly, his expression unchanging. “But there’s no need to put on airs. Even if you were some great Yao King tens of thousands of years ago, after seizing another’s body now—how much of that strength can you truly wield? Careful you don’t capsize in the gutter; dying that way would be quite an ugly sight.”

Xue Lian was taken aback for a moment, then burst into roaring laughter, the sound rolling like thunder as if greatly delighted; he nodded and said, “Not bad, not bad. Even knowing my identity you show no fear and can speak so freely with me. You human brat are indeed impressive; you've made me admire you and I'm somewhat loath to kill you. Hmm, I only recently seized this body and endured tens of thousands of years of weakness, so I can't display my full strength yet, but… killing you is still no problem. Besides, you must die — I like the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Force inside you; hand it over obediently and I'll give you a quick death!”

“The Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Force?” Yang Kai frowned and showed a flash of realization. “So it was Senior who tried to move on me in the cave earlier; no wonder something felt off.”

“Your perception is sharp!” Xue Lian snorted coldly. “Enough chatter. Surrender obediently; I won't be too cruel to you. But if you dare resist…”

“What if I resist?” Yang Kai snorted. As the words fell, his figure flickered and he suddenly vanished from where he stood.

“What's this…” Xue Lian knit his brows and showed a trace of gravity. The instant Yang Kai disappeared, he sensed a strange power spreading out — familiar yet alien — and quickly realized, exclaiming, “Spatial Force!”

Xue Lian's eyes shot out terrifying blood-red light, his expression twisting into one of wild excitement.

He had not expected this — that the human body would conceal so many treasures that even he coveted so fiercely.

Leaving aside the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Force—something every yao expert longed to possess—even this unorthodox Spatial Force was not something an ordinary cultivator could ever hope to master.

If he could occupy this human brat's body, both the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Force and the Spatial Force he cultivated could be his! Though his original yao body inherited ancient blood and bore the lineage of Primordial Aberrant Species, how could it compare to the Golden Sacred Dragon and that spatial power? Xue Lian thought that if he seized Yang Kai's body, his future cultivation might even surpass his peak!

“Good, good! Heaven really aids me!” Xue Lian roared with laughter, greed shining in his blood-red eyes.

A hissing sound suddenly rose as a crescent-shaped spatial rift appeared five zhang before Xue Lian. The rift was three zhang long; once formed it rushed at him with a thunderous force, exuding a voidish, chaotic aura that made one extremely uneasy, as if it intended to banish him to endless emptiness.

“You can use spatial power to this extent!” Xue Lian shouted, more thrilled than surprised.

He remained in place without moving to dodge; not even a hint of retreat. Xue Lian merely reached out with a large hand and clenched forward.

As he grasped, the rapidly advancing crescent rift seemed to be bound by some force and froze midair, unable to inch forward.

Xue Lian's brows tightened as his yao essence whirled madly; he roared, “Break!”

At his shout, the crescent rift was actually grasped and shattered in midair; the severed spatial seam writhed and then repaired itself.

Clatter…

A faint sound came from beneath Xue Lian’s feet, and a gray, hazy figure shot up above his head. Gripping a pitch-black staff in both hands, it swung it down with all its might.

“What is this?” Xue Lian was startled — even with his perception he had detected no sign of the figure approaching; he only noticed when it burst from the ground.

Focusing his gaze, he found the figure was not flesh and blood but like a humanoid chunk of rock.

It was not tall, only about the length of an ordinary person's thigh.

Yet the pitch-black staff it held swung with a force that made Xue Lian's heart quake.

If that staff struck true, Xue Lian reckoned even he would not fare well.

His face turned dark as he snorted; blood-red mist suddenly spread from his body like a sentient thing to form a solid defense above him.

The pitch-black staff came crashing down.

A cracking sound rang out — Xue Lian's defense could not hold against the staff's might and shattered; the black staff, its momentum unspent, slammed down toward his head.

Xue Lian's expression finally changed; blood-red scales covered his body as he unleashed the Jiao Transformation and threw a brutal punch at the staff. His fist carried not only terrifying force fluctuations but also a strange aura.

The power of Domain!

Boom…

Blood-red and black lights collided, erupting a dazzling halo; Xue Lian's body slammed into the ground while the small figure was flung back, landing hard before staggering to its feet as if nothing had happened.

A loud bird cry sounded; in the void a crimson strange bird swayed its beautiful form and suddenly appeared.

It beat its wings and opened its beak, spitting out ball after ball of fire imbued with terrifying power that instantly enveloped Xue Lian's position.

Xue Lian’s furious roar rang out in an instant, followed by the successive bursts of exploding fireballs, echoing one after another in violent resonance!

Yang Kai's figure reappeared like a phantom, his expression cold as he swooped down from high above with the Dripping Jade Dragon-Bone Sword in hand, Saint Yuan poured into it, and the massive jade-green giant dragon manifested, shaking its head and tail, opening its blood-red maw as it lunged toward Xue Lian as if to swallow him whole!

Yang Kai had almost used his full strength; he had no intention of holding back.

The opponent's strength was unfathomable; naturally he would not take him for a mere Origin Returning Realm.

The jade-green giant dragon's enormous body slammed the ground, causing the earth to tremble. Yang Kai then launched over a hundred Golden Blood Threads that danced like maddened demons, frantically shredding that space.

“Brat, you're courting death!” Xue Lian screamed madly — he hadn't expected that just after returning to the world he would suffer such a heavy loss at Yang Kai's hands.

He had thought Yang Kai was no different from Mi Tian or Lie Feng he had slain earlier; he had underestimated Yang Kai's skill.

The power of Xue Lian’s Domain surged outward, forming an invisible barrier—no matter how fiercely the fireballs rained down, none could penetrate within three zhang of his body. Each burst exploded harmlessly in midair. The jade-green dragon was sent flying by a single punch, and even Yang Kai’s golden blood threads failed to inflict any serious damage, leaving only shallow marks across his skin.

After being taken over, Xue Lian's strength was almost unbelievably formidable.

Yang Kai's eyelids tightened; he reached out and a Purple Shield instantly manifested, spanning before his body.

In the next moment, a blood-red giant fist slammed into the shield.

Crash…

The Origin-Grade upper-level defensive secret treasure Yang Kai had carried for years and refined many times by Yang Yan was shattered to pieces and could no longer aid him.

The Purple Shield's destruction slowed the fury of Xue Lian's punch, and Yang Kai seized the momentum to answer with a punch of his own.

When the two fists collided, Yang Kai felt an overwhelming power he could not resist; his throat burned as he was hurled back, flying several hundred zhang before he could barely steady himself.

Once steady, Yang Kai spat a mouthful of clotted blood and focused his gaze ahead.

Over there, dust settled; Xue Lian stood disheveled and savage, his face hideous and terrifying, his scarlet eyes glaring straight at Yang Kai across hundreds of zhang.

He seemed to have been truly enraged this time.

Yang Kai grinned, greatly relieved in his heart.

What had seemed like his all-out effort before was actually merely a powerful probe.

Now that he had attained the result he wanted, he was naturally pleased.

Xue Lian was not invincible!

He feared the Heaven-Shaking Pillar in the Stone Puppet's hands; he feared his Golden Blood Threads; he feared the Dripping Jade Dragon-Bone Sword; and he feared the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird!

All of his methods could injure him!

That was enough — Yang Kai dreaded the scenario where no matter how hard he fought, Xue Lian remained unscathed. If that happened, he'd turn tail immediately; if you can't break someone's defense, what's the point of fighting?

As Yang Kai's thoughts spun, Xue Lian's furious expression eased noticeably, as if he had realized something; a hint of apprehension flashed in his eyes.

He finally saw the situation clearly: Yang Kai was not like Mi Tian or Lie Feng — he was not someone he could slay at will.

This brat was absurdly powerful!

His gaze swept gravely over the Fire Bird, the Stone Puppet, and the jade-green giant dragon. Xue Lian suddenly cried out, “Brat, you truly are impressive! You've cultivated Spatial Force; I can't guarantee I can kill you! Here's what we'll do — leave my Void Mind Crystal, we'll shake hands and part peacefully, no more troubles between us!”

“You want the Void Mind Crystal?” Yang Kai sneered.

“Yes, that is my inner core; no matter what, I will not give it up.”

“You wish,” Yang Kai laughed. “Once the Void Mind Crystal is in my hands, I will never return it to you. If you want it, take it by force.”

“Boy, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit! This King sees potential in you and has no wish to bully the weak—don’t take my leniency for weakness.”

“Is that so? I feel like Senior lacks a bit of confidence. Weren't you the one who wanted my Golden Sacred Dragon Origin Force? Kill me and it's all yours — why dawdle here with petty talk and waste breath?”
