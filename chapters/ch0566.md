## Chapter 566 — Are You Really This Cold and Ruthless?

Ye Xinrou had thought her fate was sealed this time, but unexpectedly, at the last moment, Yang Kai led a large group of experts in a sudden and effortless breakout, rescuing Yang Wei and Yang Zhao with surprising ease.

At present, the Yinming Ghost King and the Destruction Poison King were entangled with Ling Taixu and Li Yuanchun, leaving Ye Xinrou with no one guarding her. Naturally, she wanted to seize this chance to escape.

But she could not move at all. The Poison King had done something to her; her True Yuan would not condense, and her limbs were weak. All she could do was stand there and call out to Yang Kai.

Hearing her, Yang Kai glanced back at her once. His eyes were cold and merciless.

Ye Xinrou felt a chill deep in her heart and suddenly remembered the deep enmity that had developed between her and Yang Kai. Not long ago, she had ridiculed and belittled him in every way, but now she regarded him as a last straw to cling to and called for his help, which struck her as somewhat ridiculous.

Suddenly, the Poison King waved his hand, and a dense poisonous fog enveloped Ye Xinrou and Kang Zhan at lightning speed, cutting off all contact between them and the outside world.

"Young Master Yang, we must leave now!" Li Yuanchun shouted anxiously. The battle with the two Evil Kings had placed enormous pressure on him. Not only were their True Yuan thick and their realms profound, but their cultivation techniques were also strange and insidious, making it impossible to guard against.

Li Yuanchun reckoned that if the fight continued, it would be only a matter of time—less than a tea break really—before he and Ling Taixu would be defeated.

"Go!" Yang Kai bellowed and hurriedly retreated. Tang Yuxian, Qu Gaoyi, and others supported the four Blood Servants who had followed Yang Wei and Yang Zhao, closely trailing behind.

Only after Ling Taixu, Li Yuanchun, and the others had moved far away did they make a feint and withdraw from the battlefield.

After the fierce battle, Yang Kai and his group were completely unharmed, successfully rescuing six people.

This displeased the Poison King and the Ghost King, who stood quietly gazing in the direction they had left. The Ghost King sneered, "Where could they possibly escape to? Our Lord is on his way."

The Poison King waved his hand, dispersing the poisonous fog enveloping Ye Xinrou and Kang Zhan. Looking at them, he suddenly laughed, "This young lady seems quite ill-regarded by that man. Young lady, tell me, if I hadn’t intervened just now, do you think that young man would have rescued you?"

Ye Xinrou was momentarily stunned. After pondering, her delicate face twisted in expression.

She indeed thought that with Yang Kai’s vengeful, cruel, and selfish nature, he would likely not care whether she lived or died.

Her heart instantly swelled with incomparable rage and hatred.

The Poison King and Ghost King laughed sinisterly in unison. They seemed to delight in watching such scenes and expressions.

Within War City, chaos reigned.

When Yang Kai and the others retreated, they found countless people scrambling to flee.

The entire city, gathering tens of thousands due to the Succession War, was naturally restless as the five Evil Kings of Cangyun Evil Land launched their coordinated assault.

Before they could escape the city, countless Demonic Beasts broke through the walls, bearing the summons of death as they stormed into the city.

These were the Demonic Beasts commanded by the Thunder Beast King, the highest-ranking Demonic Beasts that could be found throughout Cangyun Evil Land. The Thunder Beast King had painstakingly prepared them for this attack on Zhongdu.

Terrifyingly fierce and fearsome, whether on land or in the sky, every beast was monstrous.

Among the tens of thousands in War City, very few were outstanding experts; when struck by these strange Demonic Beasts, they were utterly powerless to resist.

A strong stench of blood soon filled the air; broken walls and scorched earth covered the ground as birds flew past the sky, and the land groaned mournfully.

In contrast, Yang Kai’s residence remained safe and sound.

It seemed even the Demonic Beasts knew better than to provoke those inside, deliberately avoiding Yang Kai’s estate while wreaking havoc elsewhere.

“Heal them!” Yang Kai ordered as he had Yang Wei, Yang Zhao, and the four Blood Servants brought inside the residence, instructing Qiu Yimeng to attend to their injuries.

Qiu Yimeng nodded quickly and set about making arrangements.

Yang Wei and Yang Zhao were not seriously injured; they had only been affected by poison and ghostly energy, and after a few days of meditation and cultivation, they would likely suffer no lasting harm. However, the four Blood Servants protecting them had been severely wounded by the Poison King’s strike and urgently needed Wan Yao Ling Milk to dispel the injuries within their bodies.

From the time they went out to rescue Yang Wei and Yang Zhao to their return had been no more than the time it took to drink a cup of tea. After Yang Kai finished arranging for the rescued, he released his Divine Sense to survey beyond War City—only for his expression to darken.

The battle outside War City had already ceased.

Within Fengshen Hall, the seven had fought against the three great Evil Kings, and the outcome was apparent.

The three ominous evil auras still lingered, yet the seven inside Fengshen Hall had vanished without a trace. Only a faint aura was rapidly approaching on this side.

Looking up, a figure suddenly flashed in front of his eyes—a heavily bloodied and grievously wounded body fell heavily from the sky, landing right before Yang Kai’s residence.

Yang Kai rushed out and brought the person in.

Everyone stared with sorrow.

This man was none other than the rotund elder of the Huo Family. Half his body had been destroyed; his internal organs were exposed, both legs severed at the knees, and his blood almost completely drained.

Under normal circumstances, such injuries would have been fatal long ago.

Yet this fat elder, relying on exquisite cultivation, clung to his final breath and managed to fly here.

Huo Xingchen, this spoiled scion, panicked the moment he saw his family’s patriarch in such a state, frozen and at a loss.

“The might of the Evil Kings… is truly not exaggerated.” The fat elder’s face drained of color as he coughed painfully, gripping Yang Kai’s hand tightly. The last glimmer of light remained in his eyes as he said gravely, “Young man of the Yang Family, if you survive this ordeal, run far and high. When your cultivation is complete, you must return to repay our vengeance!”

Yang Kai looked at him indifferently. Though he felt some regret, he shook his head slowly, “Senior, after experiencing a Succession War, these Eight Great Families have nothing to do with me anymore.”

Hearing this, the faint light in the fat elder’s eyes suddenly dimmed. Summoning strength from somewhere, he roared angrily, “Are you really this cold and ruthless?”

This roar seemed to drain his last reserves. He then sagged weakly and said, “Though indeed it is we Eight Great Families who have wronged you… you… run for your life. I don’t even know if it’s still in time…”

His voice grew increasingly faint and weak until the last word was uttered. The fat elder’s eyes lost all expression, staring wide open but lifeless.

“Ancestor!” Huo Xingchen dropped to his knees, howling in grief.

Yang Kai took a slow breath and gently closed ancestor’s wide-open eyes.

In such a short span, the seven masters from Fengshen Hall had been completely annihilated. So this was the so-called might of those above the Divine Roaming Realm? Yang Kai truly didn’t know whether to scoff.

It seemed that the seven of Fengshen Hall truly were the weakest among those at the Divine Roaming level.

Yang Kai had yet to reach that realm, so he did not understand its secrets well enough to judge the lives of others.

Standing up, he looked out. Outside the estate, three figures and a beast had appeared.

Heaven-Dominating Force King, Lightning Shadow King, Thunder Beast King—and the seventh-tier Demonic Beast, Spider Mother!

Swish, swish—

Two more figures flew in swiftly, standing in another direction.

The Destruction Poison King and Yinming Ghost King had also caught up.

The five great Evil Kings had gathered, all looking at Yang Kai’s estate with disdainful, mocking eyes, wearing relaxed and casual expressions mixed with curiosity.

They did not understand why the people inside this residence had yet to flee. The entire War City was in flight to save their lives, yet they were calm and unmoving as if rooted like a mountain.

Heaven-Dominating Force King grinned widely, locking eyes with Yang Kai and showing a hint of interest. He noticed that this young man was utterly fearless, his expression calm and composed.

Facing these five Evil Kings, anyone else would have felt immense pressure.

Everyone within the estate changed color.

Li Yuanchun was even eager to act, determined that if they could not hold the line here, he would immediately take Yang Kai and flee.

“Shopkeeper Meng, it’s time to act. If we don’t move now, we’re just waiting to die,” Yang Kai said softly to Meng Wuya in the back.

Until this moment, Yang Kai still did not know what methods Meng Wuya had concealed to ensure the safety of everyone in the estate, but now was the moment for the mystery to be unveiled.

Meng Wuya nodded lightly and without further delay extended his hand. In his palm, a small secret treasure in the form of a palace suddenly appeared.

The treasure gleamed brilliantly, exquisitely beautiful. The small palace seemed carefully carved with superb craftsmanship, its beams and decorations masterfully intricate.

The instant this small palace appeared, it attracted everyone's attention.

Yang Kai was also moved. He realized that this secret treasure was unlike ordinary ones; even the highest-grade Mystic treasures he had obtained paled in comparison.

He was uncertain about the grade of the secret treasure Meng Wuya wielded, but it was definitely of very high caliber.

The five Evil Kings watched greedily, coveting it and eager to study its powers and functions in detail.

Meng Wuya remained calm and suddenly poured his True Yuan into the treasure with great intensity.

As the True Yuan infused, the small palace rapidly expanded. In the time of a single breath, it swelled into a colossal, incorporeal body, passing through everyone and the buildings of the estate, enveloping the entire residence.

From outside, Yang Kai’s residence now appeared to be encased in a palace—transparent nonetheless, allowing all movements inside to be clearly seen. Yet, an inexplicable mysterious energy blocked the Evil Kings from probing Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

The five furrowed their brows, puzzled by what had just happened.

“Trying to stop me with a barrier? Delusional!” Heaven-Dominating Force King bellowed. His burly figure, surprisingly agile and nimble, quickly charged to Yang Kai’s estate and swung a fist out fiercely.

Boom—

A thunderous sound erupted; the entire War City seemed to tremble.

Heaven-Dominating Force King was the strongest in strength under heaven!

When he unleashed his full power, he could deliver an attack overturning rivers and seas. In raw power, even the Evil Lord Yang Bai was no match for him.
