## Chapter 277 — Not Like This...

After fleeing to Hidden Cloud Peak, the two finally slowed down. Yang Kai looked at Dong Qingyan with suspicion, his face filled with confusion, not understanding why she was blushing.

“What’s going on?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows and asked.

Dong Qingyan shot him a glance, then took a deep breath and explained helplessly, “Cousin, when alchemists talk about sparring, it refers to exchanging insights on alchemy. We gather some common materials and then refine Pills, determining the winner based on the quantity, quality, and refining time, not like you…”

While speaking, she animatedly waved her small fists, “Not like this…”

Yang Kai was taken aback, his face turning red as well, awkwardly saying, “They didn’t make it clear; how was I supposed to know?”

Dong Qingyan let out a苦笑, “This is common sense… Luckily, you didn’t go too hard and didn’t injure them. If you had really hurt them, the consequences would have been serious.”

As she spoke, she slapped her forehead, exasperated, “Indeed, martial artists are just a bunch of brutes who only know how to fight…”

Yang Kai felt extremely embarrassed, realizing why those three guys were so excited when they heard he agreed to spar, as if they had no idea how to write the word “death.”

They thought he was going to compete in alchemy…

That beating was truly unjust.

Feeling guilty, Yang Kai remained silent on the way back, while Dong Qingyan kept giggling, covering her mouth as she recalled what had just happened.

Upon returning to the peak, after handing over the medicinal materials they had gathered today to the two beautiful women, and finishing the medicinal meal they had prepared, Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan each returned to their rooms to rest.

The next day, before Yang Kai even stepped out, he caught a whiff of a rich and fragrant aroma wafting from outside, filling him with a sense of comfort.

Curious, Yang Kai opened the door and stepped outside, following the scent.

Looking around, he saw two large vats steaming in the distance, each boiling a variety of strange medicinal materials. The two beautiful women were each responsible for one vat, fanning the flames beneath, busy and sweating profusely.

“What is Master going to refine?” Dong Qingyan also came out, curiously observing, her big eyes sparkling with excitement.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai stepped forward and asked, “Do you need our help?”

Aunt Xiang, one of the beautiful women, stood up upon hearing this, smiling as she looked at them. She nodded and said, “Yes.”

Yang Kai rolled up his sleeves and asked, “What should we do?”

Aunt Xiang smiled slightly, “You don’t need to do anything for now. These two pots of medicinal soup are prepared for you two. They’ve been simmering all night and will be ready soon.”

“Prepared for us?” Yang Kai was taken aback.

Aunt Lan nodded, “Yes. Elder Xiao has been preparing various medicinal materials for the past month, and the ones you gathered yesterday are all in there.”

“I have a share too?” Yang Kai felt a little touched. He could understand why Elder Xiao would prepare something for Dong Qingyan, as she had already become his disciple and inheritor. But to think he also had a share surprised him.

Aunt Xiang slightly nodded, “Of course. Once you enter Hidden Cloud Peak, you are part of Hidden Cloud Peak. You two should eat something first and prepare yourselves. Come back in an hour.”

Yang Kai opened his mouth, feeling a hint of warmth in his heart.

Breakfast was already prepared in the kitchen, and it was also steaming hot, likely just finished. While eating, he watched Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan busily working, and a gentle warmth rose in his heart.

It had been a long time since he felt this way.

An hour later, Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan each entered a room.

In Yang Kai’s room, Aunt Xiang was in charge. Following her instructions, Yang Kai took off his upper garments, wearing only a thin pair of pants, and jumped into the medicinal soup.

He had always respected these two beautiful women on Hidden Cloud Peak.

They had silently contributed over twenty years on Hidden Cloud Peak, spending the best years of their lives here. Yet, the world only knew of Xiao Fusheng on Hidden Cloud Peak, and no one had ever acknowledged these two inconspicuous women.

Even Yang Kai, after entering Hidden Cloud Peak for a month, had his daily life taken care of by them, with meticulous attention, only calling them Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan, without knowing their full names.

Thus, even though he was bare-chested at this moment, he felt no sense of awkwardness.

“Aunt Xiang, what should I do now?” Yang Kai asked, feeling the warmth around him, his body and mind relaxed.

“Operate the cultivation technique that Elder Xiao taught you! That technique is specifically designed to absorb the medicinal effects of this pot of soup, and it has no other use. These medicinal materials are hard to gather, and Elder Xiao spent a lot of effort to collect them all. There are only these two pots, so you must be careful not to waste the medicinal effects and disappoint Elder Xiao’s good intentions.”

“I understand!” Yang Kai replied solemnly, closing his eyes and starting to operate the technique.

As he operated the technique, Yang Kai felt as if every pore in his body was opening up, and the medicinal power hidden in the soup seemed to transform into countless sharp needles.

Omnipresent and penetrating.

It surged into his body through his pores.

Unable to help himself, Yang Kai let out a muffled groan, his body trembling slightly.

Meanwhile, from the next room, a heart-wrenching scream came from Dong Qingyan.

After all, Dong Qingyan was a girl, and having been pampered, she could hardly endure such pain.

Aunt Lan’s comforting voice immediately followed from next door, while Aunt Xiang focused on observing Yang Kai’s reaction, her beautiful eyes flashing with concern, unable to help but feel moved.

Elder Xiao had previously mentioned that this method of using medicinal soup to refine the body had significant effects, but the pain endured was inhumane. He had worried whether Yang Kai and Dong Qingyan could withstand it, but now it seemed that Yang Kai had no issues at all.

The pain seemed to intensify gradually, and after a moment, not only did he feel pain on the surface of his body, but even his meridians and internal organs were not spared from the intense agony.

It felt as if millions of ants were gnawing at his body.

Sweat beads dripped down his forehead, and Yang Kai’s skin turned crimson like blood, yet the technique continued to operate without pause.

This endless pain lasted for a full hour, and suddenly, the pain lessened significantly.

It seemed to reach a limit, and this alleviation became increasingly apparent. In just a moment, all the pain disappeared without a trace.

In its place was a refreshing sensation.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but take a deep breath, slowly opening his eyes, his gaze shining brightly.

Aunt Xiang looked at Yang Kai with satisfaction, a smile on her face. After listening for a moment, she said, “Elder Xiao underestimated your endurance. It seems that she has held on over there as well.”

As she spoke, she tossed various medicinal materials into the soup again and turned to continue fanning the flames.

The miraculous technique no longer needed to be deliberately operated; it was now moving autonomously under the influence of the medicinal soup flowing into his body.

With each cycle, Yang Kai could feel his flesh and blood becoming more solid, his meridians wider and tougher, and the True Essence within him purer.

“Aunt Xiang, this pot of medicinal soup should be reserved for Miss Dong,” Yang Kai felt a bit uneasy. He had come to Hidden Cloud Peak for another purpose and had previously stated that his ambitions did not lie in alchemy, yet Elder Xiao still treated him as one of their own.

Aunt Xiang chuckled lightly, “Elder Xiao’s medicinal soup is too potent; one can only use it once in a lifetime. If your young lady uses it a second time, her meridians won’t be able to bear it.”

After a pause, Aunt Xiang added, “Don’t feel burdened. Elder Xiao actually has high hopes for you; it’s just that your path differs from that of an alchemist.”

“What effect does this pot of medicinal soup have?” Yang Kai asked curiously.

Aunt Xiang pondered for a moment before patiently explaining, “According to Elder Xiao, it can fundamentally improve a person’s meridians, making it easier for you to refine Primordial Qi in the future, allowing the Primordial Qi to become purer.”

“Is this related to alchemy?” Yang Kai frowned, suddenly recalling something Elder Xiao had said when they first met.

“The path of an alchemist is one that many have gone astray on, and I too have erred!”

Yang Kai still remembered the loneliness and regret in Elder Xiao’s words.

Aunt Xiang nodded, “Of course, it is related. Elder Xiao only recently comprehended this, but he realized it too late. Alchemists, like martial artists, need pure Primordial Qi as a foundation to refine good Pills, which is why he uses such tests to select disciples.”

As she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, Aunt Xiang fell into thought, and after a moment, she said, “Elder Xiao once said that if he were to take a disciple, he would definitely teach them one principle.”

“What principle?”

“Without entering the Divine Roaming Realm, one cannot refine Pills!” Aunt Xiang let out a苦笑, “Perhaps this is not the ultimate truth and may not be correct, but it is Elder Xiao’s understanding of alchemy.”

Without entering the Divine Roaming Realm, one cannot refine Pills! No wonder he had not taught Dong Qingyan any alchemy techniques until now; instead, he had shown great concern for her realm advancement over the past month.

“If you are interested in learning alchemy, you would be the kind of talent Elder Xiao desires!” Aunt Xiang chuckled.

Elder Xiao intended to cultivate an alchemist only after first nurturing a Divine Roaming Realm disciple, which required his disciples to have a certain pursuit in martial arts.

Yang Kai’s yearning for martial arts clearly met this requirement.

“Elder Xiao is too kind,” Yang Kai shook his head slightly. Until his strength reached a certain level, he did not plan to divert his attention to other matters.

While alchemists were indeed noble and admired by the world, that was not Yang Kai’s pursuit.

“By the way, I heard you beat up the three disciples of Elder Duan from Cloud Coming Peak yesterday?” Aunt Xiang changed the subject, fearing Yang Kai would feel too awkward.

Yang Kai’s face flushed, scratching his head and mumbling, “I didn’t know that their sparring meant competing in alchemy…”

Aunt Xiang covered her mouth and chuckled, her shoulders shaking for a while before she regained her composure, “Now there are rumors outside that a disciple from Hidden Cloud Peak is not very skilled in alchemy but is a rogue in fights!”

“Didn’t it cause Elder Xiao any trouble?” Yang Kai felt a bit guilty.

Aunt Xiang shook her head, “No, you didn’t injure them; it was just that someone came to inform us this morning. But be careful next time; don’t just fight without understanding the reason.”

“Definitely, definitely!” Yang Kai nodded repeatedly.

This was too dishonorable, and every time he thought about it, it made him blush.
