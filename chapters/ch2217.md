## Chapter 2217 — Purple Civet

This was only natural—Soul-Devouring Worms were the bane of all Divine Soul power. Aside from their fear of the strange energies like Divine Sense Fire, there was little in this world that could threaten their existence.

Although Yang Kai's Soul-Devouring Worms originally had some drawbacks, as they grew, those flaws had long since disappeared.

To destroy these Soul-Devouring Worms, one had to possess Divine Sense Fire to restrain them, just like Yang Kai. There was no other way.

Moreover, Yang Kai wasn't even sure if Divine Sense Fire would still work on them now.

The reason he could still command these Soul-Devouring Worms to serve him was largely thanks to the Warm Spirit Lotus.

Such a bizarre thing—how could the giant python or the purple civet not be terrified?

As the black cloud swooped down, the giant python, in its panic, opened its mouth wide and spat out a mass of emerald-green mist, sending it back toward the insect cloud. In an instant, a foul stench filled the air.

“Divine Sense Poison!” Yang Kai exclaimed in astonishment.

Who knew what kind of opportunity this giant python had encountered, or if it was simply born this way, but it could actually make its Divine Sense power highly toxic. Clearly, it wanted to use this unique soul power to deal with the Soul-Devouring Worms.

Moreover, it had no intention of staying. After spitting out that poisonous cloud, it ignored both Yang Kai and the purple civet and turned to flee!

But it had clearly underestimated the strangeness of the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms.

When the pitch-black insect cloud collided with the emerald poison cloud, the green color quickly vanished before the naked eye—in just three breaths. Only the black insect cloud remained.

It looked as if all the poison cloud had been devoured by the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms.

The poison cloud was also formed from Divine Soul power, so naturally, it was a delicacy for the Soul-Devouring Worms.

After devouring the poison cloud, the Soul-Devouring Worm cloud didn’t linger and immediately swept toward the giant python, covering its head in the blink of an eye.

With its vision blocked by the insect cloud, the giant python couldn’t see at all. Its massive body began thrashing and crashing about, like a headless fly, moving without any pattern.

Yang Kai watched quietly for a while, frowning.

He realized that the always-invincible Soul-Devouring Worms didn’t seem to have a good way to deal with this giant python.

The python’s scales covered its body so tightly that even the tiny Soul-Devouring Worms couldn’t break through to gnaw at its flesh.

At this rate, the Soul-Devouring Worms probably couldn’t finish off the python unless they broke through its defenses.

With a thought, Yang Kai’s eyes lit up, and he immediately gave the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms a command.

Controlling the Soul-Devouring Worms was far more taxing than commanding the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao. The former possessed no intelligence whatsoever, while Xiaoxiao, though not particularly bright, could at least comprehend Yang Kai’s instructions.

Comparing the two, the former undoubtedly required much more effort to control.

Fortunately, the insect cloud was obedient enough. With a bit of effort, Yang Kai managed to get them to burrow into the python’s body through its mouth and nose.

After a few dozen breaths, the pitch-black insect cloud had vanished, and only a buzzing sound came from the python’s belly.

At this moment, the giant python seemed to be suffering some inhuman torment and unbearable pain, rolling and thrashing on the ground, knocking down countless trees.

But this attack from within was something it simply couldn’t resolve, so it could only await death!

As it struggled, the python clearly didn’t want to sit and wait for death. Waves of soul attacks blasted out in all directions, wild and indiscriminate. Yang Kai watched in alarm and dared not get too close.

As time passed, the light on the python’s body flickered, growing dimmer and dimmer, and its struggles gradually weakened.

Finally, at a certain moment, the python raised its head straight up, then collapsed limply, the light on its body suddenly going dark.

Yang Kai stood there with a calm expression, quietly waiting.

After a while, a hole suddenly burst open somewhere on the python’s body, and countless Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms swarmed out, flying back to Yang Kai and returning to his sleeve.

Only then did Yang Kai step forward, crouching to examine the leftover python skin. This layer of skin was as thin as a cicada’s wing, covered in scales. He had no idea what it was made of, but it was incredibly tough—even the Soul-Devouring Worms ignored it.

So after devouring all the python’s essence, the Soul-Devouring Worms simply flew out.

If he could take this thing out, perhaps it could be refined into an impressive Defensive Soul Secret Treasure…

Thinking this, Yang Kai tapped the python skin. To his surprise, at his touch, the skin instantly crumbled apart like rotten wood, turning to dust.

This result left him stunned.

He secretly thought that the python’s previous defensive power must have come from some special energy within its body.

Now that the skin was useless, Yang Kai naturally didn’t bother taking it. Besides, he didn’t know how to bring things from this world outside, unless it was something that could be absorbed into his Spirit Body, like a Divine Soul Secret Treasure.

But whether Divine Soul Secret Treasures even existed in this world was another matter entirely. After all, everything here—mountains, earth, even the trees—was formed from a strange energy akin to Divine Soul power. There simply weren’t any of the rare minerals needed to forge Secret Treasures in the first place.

He turned and returned to where the purple civet had originally been.

To his shock, the purple civet that should have been lying unconscious on the ground had vanished without a trace.

Yang Kai was truly surprised.

It seemed that, as a Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast, the purple civet’s ability to survive here wasn’t just luck.

However… as soon as Yang Kai swept his Divine Sense, he immediately locked onto the purple civet’s location.

At the top of a large tree, the purple civet was quietly hiding, its small eyes full of intelligence as it warily watched below.

Just as it was focused on observing, Yang Kai suddenly disappeared from its sight.

Driven by instinct, all the purple civet’s fur stood on end.

“Hmph, did you really think hiding would keep me from finding you?” Yang Kai’s cold laugh sounded from behind the purple civet. Before it could react, he reached out, grabbed it by the scruff of its neck, and lifted it up to eye level.

The purple civet immediately began to tremble, its eyes full of fear as it looked timidly at Yang Kai.

“It seems you’re only fast and a bit intelligent, nothing else.” Yang Kai mused, staring at it. If it had any other abilities, it would have used them by now. Being held like this, it was clearly helpless.

But as Yang Kai spoke, the purple civet seemed to think of something and quickly reached its paw toward its belly.

Yang Kai’s gaze followed, and he immediately saw something surprising.

He discovered that the purple civet’s belly actually had a pouch-like thing, as if it was born that way.

This made him even more curious.

At that moment, the purple civet took something from the pouch on its belly—a fruit that looked just like a grape, entirely purple and exuding a strange fragrance.

After Yang Kai took a sniff, he immediately felt refreshed. The discomfort caused by absorbing too much Divine Soul Origin was somewhat alleviated.

His eyes lit up, gaze fixed on the purple fruit.

After taking out the fruit, the purple civet held it in its paws and offered it straight to Yang Kai, looking at him with a pitiful expression as if to say, “Great King, please accept this fruit and spare my life…”

This action made Yang Kai feel the creature was even more intelligent.

Clearly, it wanted to use the fruit to win his favor so he wouldn’t harm it.

Finding it amusing, Yang Kai smiled at the purple civet, stopped making things difficult for it, and set it down.

Perched on the treetop, the purple civet let out a sigh of relief, but still held the fruit, standing on its hind legs and offering it to Yang Kai.

“Then I’ll gladly accept it.” Yang Kai coughed lightly and took the fruit from its paws.

To be honest, he was very curious about the fruit. Although Gao Xueting had said before that this world had many strange products with wondrous effects, Yang Kai had never expected that even here, spirit fruits could grow.

And this fruit was clearly something greatly beneficial to the soul.

Since he couldn’t take it out, Yang Kai gave up that idea, examined the fruit for a while, then popped it into his mouth.

After a few chews, Yang Kai swallowed it, and his expression immediately brightened.

He could clearly feel the fruit turning into a wondrous energy inside him, not only strengthening himself but also greatly relieving his discomfort.

Yang Kai estimated that if he had three or four more of these fruits, he could completely rid himself of the discomfort.

“Do you have any more of these?” Yang Kai looked down at the purple civet, gesturing as he tried to communicate with the Demonic Beast.

Unexpectedly, the purple civet immediately understood, pointed its little paw at the spot where the python had died, then at the depths of the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range, chittering away.

Yang Kai frowned in thought, then said, “You mean…the python was guarding the fruit, and because you stole one, it chased you here? And there are more fruits where it lived?”

The purple civet nodded vigorously.

“Then what are we waiting for? Lead the way!” Yang Kai waved his hand, his spirits lifted as he called out.

The discomfort in his soul not only prevented him from absorbing more Divine Soul Origin, but also affected his state. If he could resolve it quickly, it would be a great thing.

So Yang Kai was eager to find more of those fruits.
