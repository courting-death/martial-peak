## Chapter 1641 — A Clash of Words

"Young Brother Yang, what brings you to Chi Lan Star this time?" Bing Long asked again.

"I was merely passing through by chance."

"Do you know the Fire Radiance Sect has been searching for your trail for the past year?"

"I've heard as much."

"Why is the Fire Radiance Sect making such a big show looking for you?"

After a few questions, Bing Long's inquiries gradually became more direct.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, lifted his teacup and took a sip, then shook his head and said, "I don't know!"

"You don't know?" Bing Long chuckled softly, her voice suddenly lowering. "Then I shall ask again—did Lord Luo Hai, Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, come to Chi Lan Star because of you?"

"Since you already know, why ask further?" Yang Kai replied.

Bing Long was astonished. "Lord Luo Hai truly came because of you?"

Although she had suspected as much—after all, Luo Hai, upon arriving at Chi Lan Star, went to the Fire Radiance Sect, which then began searching for Yang Kai—these links naturally invited conjecture.

Conjecture or not, once Yang Kai confirmed it, Bing Long still felt very surprised.

What kind of figure was Luo Hai? Across the entire Star Domain, his name ranked among the foremost—yet he had actually come all the way from Cuiwei Star to Chi Lan Star for Yang Kai’s sake. It was impossible not to take notice of such a thing.

"Why?" Bing Long pressed again.

Yang Kai shook his head and adopted a serious tone. "This junior cannot answer. If you wish to know, you might ask Luo Hai himself."

The surprise in Bing Long's eyes deepened.

Yang Kai had actually called Luo Hai by name—without the slightest display of respect.

One must understand: at Luo Hai's level of strength, regardless of any ties, out of respect for such experts one would normally append 'Lord' or 'Elder' to the name.

Even ordinary Void King Realm cultivators do not forgo this custom. Bing Long, though Valley Lord of Ice Heart Valley, still had to respectfully address him as Lord Luo Hai.

Yang Kai, however, treated him as if he were nothing.

Observing him, Bing Long exclaimed in astonishment, "Do you have enmity with Lord Luo Hai?"

"He chased me from Cuiwei Star all the way to Chi Lan Star; several times I nearly died and yet survived—are you asking whether I bear a grudge against him?" Yang Kai sneered coldly.

He made no attempt to hide it—such matters could not be concealed.

Bing Long and Ran Yunting both shuddered and stared at Yang Kai in disbelief.

After a long moment, Bing Long's expression grew complex. "You are truly lucky—to have escaped with your life from Lord Luo Hai's hand!"

She believed Yang Kai’s survival was purely a matter of luck. Otherwise, how could someone at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm possibly have escaped alive from the hands of a Second Stage Void King Realm expert?

"What grudge do you hold against Lord Luo Hai? Tell it in detail!" Ran Yunting suddenly spoke; it was her first word since arriving, and her tone brooked no contradiction.

Yang Kai's brow tightened. He thought privately that he was not a disciple of Ice Heart Valley—what gave her the right to address him in such an overbearing manner?

But considering she was Su Yan's master, Yang Kai refrained from giving her attitude and said, "On this matter I beg your pardon; this junior cannot disclose it."

“Boy, have you still not grasped the situation? This is Icebound Island—and you’ve even provoked a powerhouse like Lord Luo Hai. If you want to live, you’d best cooperate with us obediently. Otherwise, no matter how great your ability, you won’t escape this calamity!” Ran Yunting’s face darkened as she saw how little sense Yang Kai showed.

Yang Kai looked at her with narrowed eyes. He said calmly, "Is this a threat, Elder?"

Ran Yunting’s charming face turned cold, and just as she was about to speak again, Bing Long hurriedly interjected, “The Great Elder did not mean it that way. It’s just that this matter is truly of great consequence. I may be presumptuous, but let me call you by name, Yang Kai—though your talent and cultivation are commendable, offending a powerhouse like Lord Luo Hai will surely cast a shadow over your future.”

"I know," Yang Kai said indifferently, nodding.

“Since you understand, I won’t say more. My Ice Heart Valley has a Grand Elder in residence—also at the Void King Realm. Though her strength may not match Lord Luo Hai’s, her strength is by no means ordinary, and she has met him several times before. If you can clearly explain the full circumstances of this matter, I can request the Grand Elder to step forward and speak on your behalf to ease this crisis. What do you think?”

Bing Long’s open and sincere manner eased Yang Kai’s anger somewhat, but he still shook his head and said, “There’s no need to trouble the Seniors over my affairs—this junior will handle them himself.”

“You? What ability do you have to handle such a troublesome matter?” Ran Yunting clearly held a strong dislike for Yang Kai. Hearing his words, she sneered mockingly, “Boy, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit! If you’re unwilling to speak, then why did you even come to my Ice Heart Valley?”

"Isn't Ice Heart Valley the one that's been looking for me?" Yang Kai glanced at Ran Yunting.

Ran Yunting's face flared with anger as Saint Yuan surged within her and began to circulate; immense might descended like heaven and enveloped Yang Kai as if she intended to strike.

Bing Long's face shifted slightly and she hurriedly said, "Yang Kai, since you refuse to speak, neither I nor the Grand Elder will force you. Think it over—if you agree, have a disciple send word to me at any time, and I will ask the Grand Elder to intervene and help resolve this matter."

"I appreciate your kindness, Elder; this junior understands," Yang Kai replied coolly.

"Very well, then rest here for now; we'll address future matters later." Bing Long sighed and took her leave.

Ran Yunting glared at Yang Kai, snorted coldly, and followed. At the main gate she suddenly turned, fixed him with a frigid gaze and said sternly, "Boy, don't think I don't know what you're scheming. I advise you to give up that thought—she is destined to soar and become a phoenix; someone like you mustn't lay a hand on her. Don't ruin her future!"

Having said it, Ran Yunting gave him no chance to reply and turned away.

Yang Kai remained impassive, standing as he watched her and Bing Long depart.

From her words it was clear she had discovered his relationship with Su Yan; no wonder she had been so hostile from the start.

It was likely born of an anxious wish to protect her disciple. Yang Kai inhaled deeply and calmed his anger.

Frankly, for Su Yan to have such a master looking out for her was not a bad thing—yet Ran Yunting's attitude left Yang Kai deeply displeased.

"Junior Sister, you seem off today." On the return to the inner island, Bing Long looked at Ran Yunting thoughtfully. "Do you know something? Why are you so harsh toward Yang Kai—did you know him before?"

"I don't!" Ran Yunting shook her head, pondered for a moment, then sighed. "Senior Sister, I'll be frank. Yang Kai and Su Yan knew each other before!"

"Oh? How did they come to know one another?" Bing Long asked, greatly surprised.

"Didn't he say he came from Tongxuan Continent? Su Yan is from that place as well. They once seemed to be senior and junior sisters, and..."

Bing Long's brows drew together as a realization dawned on her. "Could it be that they..."

"Indeed! Not only that—Su Yan is no longer the flawless white jade she once was!"

"What?" Bing Long's expression changed in shock. "But... but didn't Su Yan cultivate the Ice Jade Skill? How could she not have suffered backlash?"

"The backlash has already come—Su Yan's cultivation has declined and her state of mind has developed cracks; the Ice Heart is tarnished!" Ran Yunting ground her teeth. "If I'm not mistaken, that boy came to Icebound Island for Su Yan's sake. Yesterday I even discovered they were communicating through some strange spiritual connection.

Bing Long's face flickered as she murmured, "They can communicate through mind power—could this be a kindred connection of the heart? It seems their relationship is indeed extraordinary. If that is so, wouldn't Su Yan's future be ruined?"

“There is a way to resolve it!” A fierce and ruthless light flashed in Ran Yunting’s eyes.

Seeing her expression, Bing Long soon realized the implications and shook her head. "We cannot act so hastily. Lord Luo Hai came because of him; if he dies now, Ice Heart Valley will have no way to answer to Lord Luo Hai. Besides, the method is unsafe—what if Su Yan bears a grudge against you..."

"Let her bear a grudge!" Ran Yunting chuckled, a tinge of madness in her smile. "To be frank, Senior Sister, I likely have no hope of advancing to the Void King Realm in this lifetime, but Su Yan has that potential. What I cannot achieve, I hope she will. If she reaches that step, what does it matter if she resents me? One day she will understand I did it for her own good!"

"Junior Sister..." Bing Long looked at her, then sighed, her expression dim.

Ran Yunting claimed she had no hope of advancing to the Void King Realm—but was Bing Long any different? She had lingered for countless years at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, repeatedly striking the bottleneck and failing, unable to grasp the secrets of the Void King Realm.

As Ran Yunting said, their generation would likely be confined to the threshold outside the Void King Realm; only a heaven-defying opportunity might grant a sliver of possibility.

Bing Long understood Ran Yunting's feelings, yet believed such measures improper, and ordered, "Let me think this over—do not act rashly!"

"I know."

After walking a while, the two went their separate ways.

Ran Yunting went straight to Su Yan's dwelling—she needed an open, honest talk with her disciple to make clear that the Dao was eternal and that romantic attachments were but passing clouds, not worth cherishing.

Not long after, Ran Yunting arrived and from afar saw a disciple outside Su Yan's ice chamber pleading with the two who stood guard, a look of supplication on her face.

Approaching, Ran Yunting discovered the disciple was Qing Ya, who had accompanied Su Yan to Ice Heart Valley.

Ran Yunting remembered the girl; when she had brought Su Yan to Ice Heart Valley years ago, Qing Ya had followed, though with inferior talent and so had always resided on the outer island.

Seeing Ran Yunting approach, Qing Ya and the two women immediately fell silent, turned toward her and saluted respectfully: "Disciple pays respects to the Great Elder!"
