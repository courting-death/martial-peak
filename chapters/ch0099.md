## Chapter 99 — Fierce Battle with Nu Lang

In the blink of an eye, the two had already clashed. Yang Kai’s fist struck fiercely against Nu Lang’s palm, only to be tightly gripped by his five fingers, held fast without escape.

Within their bodies, Primordial Qi erupted violently, colliding at the point of contact between fist and palm.

“Hmm?” Nu Lang’s eyes flashed with surprise. He realized that the Primordial Qi within Yang Kai was overwhelmingly domineering, so much so that even he could not withstand it for long.

How could this be? His own strength far surpassed Yang Kai’s; there was no way this youth could pose a threat. Yet the facts were undeniable, forcing Nu Lang to treat him with caution.

If this stalemate continued, his fingers might truly be scorched by the searing energy.

With that thought, Nu Lang abruptly withdrew his hand and took several steps back. Seizing this brief moment, he hurried to dissipate the scorching Primordial Qi that had invaded his body.

Frowning darkly, he looked toward Yang Kai again, growing even more astonished. In their previous clash, he had failed to crush Yang Kai’s fist!

Though five finger marks were left on the fist, it did not match his expectations. In his mind, that grasp should have shattered the entire fist.

This kid… truly had some skill. No wonder several of his junior brothers had been slain by him. It seemed his victories were no mere luck. Nu Lang’s expression grew grave.

Yang Kai shook his fist, glanced down at it, and when he raised his eyes again, a wild madness burned ever brighter within them.

He had long concealed this power, letting his blood boil fiercely, feeling the pain from his wounds, and the pressure from his enemy. Yang Kai sought to awaken his Unyielding Will.

Only when his indomitable spirit and resolve to win surged forth could his unique and mysterious martial technique unleash its full might.

Now, that moment had arrived!

Yang Kai no longer restrained himself.

A scorching heat suddenly surged through his bones. As this heat spread, he felt himself transform entirely.

Previously, when he had inadvertently triggered his Unyielding Will, Yang Kai had been somewhat bewildered, winning battles in a haze.

But this time was different. He clearly sensed a vast energy spontaneously growing within his bones, pouring into his meridians, saturating his flesh and blood, wildly enhancing his strength.

“Come again!” Yang Kai snarled like a ravenous wolf stalking prey in the jungle, his eyes fixed unblinkingly on Nu Lang as he unleashed a punch.

It was the same as before—no flashy moves, just a straightforward punch.

“Courting death!” Nu Lang sneered. Though surprised by Yang Kai’s Primordial Qi, he did not truly believe Yang Kai could harm him. As long as he withdrew in time, no matter how strange that energy was, it could not harm him in the slightest.

Meanwhile, he could strike Yang Kai repeatedly. Sooner or later, he would crush that entire fist! In fact, Yang Kai’s reckless fighting style suited Nu Lang’s taste perfectly.

With a cold smile, Nu Lang’s large hand reached out to grab Yang Kai again.

In their second direct clash, Nu Lang sensed something amiss. The power contained in Yang Kai’s punch was much greater than before, and the Primordial Qi erupting from it was fiercer.

It was almost like a full-force burst from the fifth stage of the Open Origin Realm!

But what of it? The fourth and fifth stages of the Open Origin Realm were mere trifles in his eyes, posing no threat at all—only a fate of death awaited.

As they exchanged blows, the wounds on Yang Kai’s fist worsened, blood pouring down. His body staggered backward, looking utterly battered. Nu Lang seized the opportunity to press the attack, claws howling through the darkness, leaving deep scratches as he relentlessly assaulted Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grunted silently, stubbornly countering. Whenever Nu Lang’s attacks came, he responded with punches—left, then right—in a clear rhythm. Though his hands were badly injured, he blocked every strike, preventing Nu Lang from landing a fatal blow.

In the night, dull thuds echoed repeatedly. With each sound, Yang Kai was forced to retreat several steps, his wounds growing heavier.

Yet his gaze never wavered; instead, it grew ever more resolute. A firm belief in victory brewed within his heart, waiting to erupt at the final moment.

“How is this possible?” Nu Lang was deeply shocked. On the surface, he held absolute advantage. After all, his realm far exceeded Yang Kai’s. If he could not dominate under such conditions, his years of cultivation would be in vain.

Yet Nu Lang was at a loss for words. His ten fingers had been scorched by Yang Kai’s searing Primordial Qi, each finger blistered as if burned by fire. The pain radiated from fingertips to heart, causing him to gasp sharply.

If that were all, Nu Lang would not be so shocked. What truly stunned him was Yang Kai’s strength.

In their first clash, Yang Kai had shown only the fourth stage of the Open Origin Realm, nothing to fear.

The second time, his strength rose to the fifth stage.

By the fourth clash, the punch and Primordial Qi Yang Kai unleashed had reached the sixth stage!

The seventh time, the seventh stage!

The twelfth time, the eighth stage!

It was as if, with each passing moment, his strength climbed steadily like a blooming sesame flower—an unfathomable and extraordinary phenomenon.

Moreover, this ascent showed no sign of stopping.

Nu Lang’s expression turned grim. He did not know how far Yang Kai’s strength could rise. If it reached the Qi Movement Realm directly, he would have no hope of victory, for Yang Kai’s Primordial Qi was far too domineering.

Half an incense stick’s time passed, and Nu Lang could no longer confront Yang Kai head-on. He simply could not gain the upper hand. Each clash left Yang Kai as immovable as a rock, while he was forced to retreat repeatedly.

Nu Lang resorted to evasive footwork, employing flexible and varied techniques, seeking an opening to deliver a fatal strike.

But Yang Kai’s defense, though simple, was impenetrable, leaving Nu Lang unable to find a moment to strike decisively.

Yang Kai had reached the ninth stage of the Open Origin Realm! Nu Lang’s eyes trembled as he realized Yang Kai’s strength had indeed climbed once more, reaching the peak of the Open Origin Realm.

Yet the fluctuations of his Primordial Qi finally stabilized, showing no further signs of rising. This discovery allowed Nu Lang to breathe a slight sigh of relief.

Though he himself was only at the first stage of the Qi Movement Realm, theoretically just one realm above the ninth stage of the Open Origin Realm, that single realm was a vast chasm.

Therefore, Nu Lang still had confidence in slaying Yang Kai.

Yang Kai must have consumed some pill to boost his strength, but whatever it was surely carried side effects. His true essence remained at the fourth stage of the Open Origin Realm. In terms of the reserves of Primordial Qi within, he could not compare to Nu Lang at all! Nu Lang waited patiently, anticipating Yang Kai’s exhaustion before delivering the killing blow.
