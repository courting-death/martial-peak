## Chapter 795 — Breaking Through

At the foot of one of the Nine Peaks, Xu Hui and the others stopped when they brought Yang Kai here.

Yang Kai frowned in puzzlement. Before him stood a massive slab of bluestone, as if it had been cut flat; moss covered its surface, and two imposing characters were carved into it.

Sacred Tomb!

This was clearly the entrance to the Sacred Tomb.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. Though he could see nothing definite, he faintly felt hidden energy fluctuations emanating from the bluestone.

Xu Hui stepped forward and formed several mysterious hand seals; the bluestone suddenly blurred, like the moon in a mirror or flowers in water—illusory and evasive—then a moment later a hole opened in the center of the stone.

Yang Kai was slightly startled and barked, "Void Passage!"

Xu Hui nodded lightly. "More or less. Entering here leads to the Sacred Tomb, where successive Saint Lords have been interred. It’s a Small Xuan Realm separate from our world. Every Saint Lord must pass this trial before taking the throne. Be careful when you go in, young brother, and whatever you do, bring out the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring the old Saint Lord wore—that ring is the key for our Sacred Land."

"Yes—no matter what, you must come out alive!" Yu Ying reminded solemnly.

"The future of the Sacred Land rests on you," Cheng Yuetong murmured, her lips pressed thinly.

The others looked on with a mix of expectation and worry, staring at Yang Kai in silence.

Yang Kai glanced at them and let out a crooked laugh, "You’d better pray I don’t come back."

"Why's that?" Xu Hui asked, puzzled.

Yang Kai’s eyes flashed like lightning as he stared coldly at them. "If I come out, you’re all in for a show."

The group fell silent, finally realizing how much he resented being forced into the Sacred Tomb. Before they could protest, Yang Kai plunged headfirst into the Void Passage.

"This future Saint Lord… not much breadth of mind. He won’t seriously come after us later, will he?" Shi Kun frowned.

Xu Hui’s expression shifted in unreadable ways as he sighed, "Young temperaments… still too immature."

"Anyway, this was the Grand Elder’s idea—I’m just here to make up numbers. If the future Saint Lord blames us later, the Grand Elder will take responsibility!" Meng Tianfei said with schadenfreude.

The others cast disdainful looks.

…

Inside the Sacred Tomb. The instant Yang Kai stepped in, the Void Passage behind him closed; a sickly green glow filled the place like a ghost-haunted realm, cold winds howled at his ears, and distant keening rose like the cries of the damned, chilling the blood.

The light was dim but enough to see; the Heaven-and-Earth Energy here was absurdly dense, almost condensed into clouds of white, thick as cotton at ground level.

This indeed was a peculiar little Xuan Realm; Yang Kai had never seen such concentrated Spiritual Qi—nearly as good as the finest Earth Vein. No wonder the old Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land chose this place to seclude himself.

With such thick Spiritual Qi, there was no need for pills or Crystal Stones; one could simply open oneself and absorb it.

Apart from its somewhat eerie atmosphere, this was truly a cultivation treasure ground.

While warily scanning his surroundings, Yang Kai’s face suddenly changed.

In his perception, clusters of energy filled with a fierce, ominous killing intent sprang up from all directions and surged toward him.

The emergence of these energies was bizarre—almost as if they had always been present, waiting for Yang Kai’s arrival to strike.

Before he could react, the energies had already surrounded him in a ring.

Yang Kai condensed his True Yuan against the unexpected threat, but he quickly sensed something was off.

These gathered energies merely circled him and didn’t actually injure him.

Frowning, Yang Kai probed more carefully and, after a moment, felt both surprise and astonishment.

He found there were nine clusters of energy in total, each containing profound and mysterious motifs—half artificial and half natural—deep and unfathomable.

Three of those clusters held motifs that struck a chord of familiarity within him.

Cautiously sending out his Divine Sense to test one of the clusters, he immediately caught a trace of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique.

Xuantian Sword!

Yang Kai’s expression shifted; probing the other familiar energies, he found the imprints of Youtian Lock and Juntian Draw.

These three divine techniques were the very moves Yang Kai had learned from An Ling'er, and he hadn't expected to encounter them here.

So these nine clusters must be the nine moves of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique, he guessed, almost certain his deduction was correct.

Xu Hui had said that to enter the Sacred Tomb one must master the Nine Heavens Divine Technique—only by relying on it could one enter safely.

These nine energies that wrapped around him were likely the trials blocking his advance; without breaking through them, there was no way to reach the inner parts of the Sacred Tomb.

Yang Kai suddenly understood a corner of the tomb’s secret. He sat cross-legged, calmed his mind, and focused on the cluster imbued with the Xuantian Sword motif.

The Nine Heavens Divine Technique was peculiar: it could be used as a martial skill wielded with True Yuan or as a soul technique by the spirit—something no ordinary manual or secret art could match.

To overcome this trial he had to deploy the Nine Heavens Divine Technique, shatter the seal of those energies, and open a path.

His Divine Sense surged; the formless power condensed into a great sword and stabbed toward one of the clusters.

Soundless and unseen.

Even Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Sense attack sank like a stone into the sea, vanishing into the energy.

He frowned and launched the Xuantian Sword several more times at that specific cluster, but each strike produced no reaction.

Yang Kai began to suspect this was more complicated than he’d thought.

Recalling Xu Hui’s words and what he’d heard about the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, an idea suddenly lit up in his mind.

Perhaps his Nine Heavens Divine Technique wasn’t refined enough—he hadn’t grasped its core mysteries, and therefore couldn’t break the energy’s seal.

He’d learned his version from An Ling'er; he could only reach the depth of her comprehension. She was young; it made sense she hadn’t fully penetrated the technique.

Yang Kai had seen Saintess Nan perform the Xuantian Sword—her execution was on an entirely different level from his, showing how consummate her mastery was.

Moreover, past Saint Lords of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had to enter the Sacred Tomb before ascending. Their cultivation levels weren’t necessarily higher than his, but they passed the tomb’s tests—so these trials weren’t about raw power but about one’s comprehension of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique.

With that in mind Yang Kai calmed himself and didn’t attempt clumsy uses of the technique; instead, he immersed his spirit in the energy laden with the Xuantian Sword motif and relaxed, carefully contemplating and probing.

As time passed, his gains were immense. Countless times his spirit witnessed the birth and execution of the Xuantian Sword within that energy, unlocking deeper secrets until the motif became ingrained in his soul.

When he opened his eyes again, the cluster he’d absorbed had become legible—its hidden laws and secrets were now within his grasp.

His Divine Sense erupted once more, and the Xuantian Sword manifested.

This time it was the purest form of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique—several degrees above what An Ling'er had grasped.

With a crisp snap, the cluster shattered as the Divine Sense strike struck true.

A winding road appeared before Yang Kai, eerily stretching into the depths of the Sacred Tomb.

Yang Kai smiled faintly; he instantly understood the tomb’s design.

Those who never practiced the Nine Heavens Divine Technique would be torn to pieces by the nine energies; but those who had could break any one of them and find a way through.

The more moves you broke, the clearer and safer the path became.

Xu Hui was right—the Nine Heavens Divine Technique was indeed the key to entering the Sacred Tomb.

Yang Kai didn’t hurry inward; instead he turned his attention to another cluster.

Having been forced into the Sacred Tomb by Xu Hui and the others, he might as well come away with something useful.

Each move of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique was exquisite and wondrous; he’d long coveted what he’d seen Saintess Nan perform. With this perfect opportunity before him, Yang Kai was not about to let it pass.

Besides, the more he cracked, the safer his further progress would be.

Resolute, Yang Kai began to probe the secrets of the other two moves he had learned.

After three or five days, Youtian Lock was broken; after another three or five days, Juntian Draw yielded…

From then on his pace slowed dramatically. The first three moves he’d learned from An Ling'er were relatively familiar, but the remaining six were wholly foreign, so he had to learn them from scratch. Fortunately, the motifs and mysteries within the energies allowed him to observe and comprehend.

The old saying that cultivation erases years was true—Yang Kai lost all sense of time while training on the Nine Heavens Divine Technique inside the Sacred Tomb, but outside the elders and guardians waited with torturous impatience.

When Yang Kai had only just entered, they were full of hope that he would emerge suddenly, ring in hand, to inherit the Saint Lord’s mantle.

Ten days later their faces grew anxious; though they said nothing, each wondered if Yang Kai had encountered trouble inside.

A month on, the atmosphere turned heavy.

Two months passed and everyone’s expressions dimmed; sighs began to drift through the camp.

Three months, four months…

The elders and guardians left behind dwindled in number; many began to believe Yang Kai would never reappear.
