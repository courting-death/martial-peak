## Chapter 435 — Old Friends Meet

In a side hall of Yang Kai’s manor, Dong Qinghan was sipping tea, reflecting on the things Feng Yun and the other had told him after returning last night. The shock in his heart had yet to fully subside.

Though he had not been present at the time, through Feng Yun’s descriptions, Dong Qinghan realized just how terrifying Yang Kai had become.

This cousin of his had grown as if guided by divine aid over these years! Dong Qinghan couldn’t help but feel a touch of envy.

After quite a while, Yang Kai finally stepped out from inside, drenched in sweat. Dong Qinghan offered no blame for the delay or any show of airs; after all, they had fought a lot when they were kids. Seeing Yang Kai, Dong Qinghan felt even closer than to his own brothers. Naturally, he did not take offense.

“You brat,” Dong Fatty said without rising, his gaze playfully fixed on Yang Kai. “You've got some skills, huh? Good thing I lent Feng Yun and the other to you last night.”

Yang Kai chuckled: “If you don’t have the diamond drill, you shouldn’t take on porcelain work. Thanks for your efforts, gentlemen.”

Yang Kai held Feng Yun and the others in high regard — not merely because they served as his cousin’s guards, but because, before the calamity that befell the Lingxiao Pavilion, Feng Yun had journeyed a thousand li alone to deliver warning. That single act had bought more than a hundred Pavilion members the precious time they needed to escape.

Had Feng Wei not arrived in time, the Lingxiao Pavilion might have suffered heavy losses. If that had happened, the currently improving relationship with Qiu Yimeng would have been impossible.

Feng Wei gave a wry smile: “Old Yun and I just took a stroll around, didn’t contribute much. The real talent is still Young Master Kai.”

Yun Wei nodded quietly. Looking at Yang Kai now, both elders were full of admiration.

No other young man had amazed them so. Their own young master was among the better young generation, but compared to this young lord, he was far from comparable.

Even Feng Yun did not know what heights Yang Kai could ultimately reach.

“This time I bring you thirty people. Besides Feng Yun and the other two, there are five Divine Roaming Realm cultivators, and the rest are all True Yuan Realm, with the lowest at the Fifth Stage!” Dong Qinghan composed his tone. “Besides that, my father sent some supplies—mostly finished Pills and some materials. Not many, but not too few.”

Yang Kai nodded silently, smiling: “Uncle’s kindness is appreciated.”

The Dong Family was Dong Suzhu’s maiden family. Yang Kai was her son. As a first-rate force, sending so many people, so many Divine Roaming Realm experts, as well as Pill materials, was quite substantial.

Before this, Yang Kai’s chances of winning the succession war had been essentially zero. There was no hope to speak of.

The Dong Family’s current investment showed they had prepared psychologically for sacrifices, especially if Divine Roaming Realm experts were lost. Such a blow would affect them deeply.

Yang Kai was fully aware of the Dong Family’s sacrifice.

“I’ve handed over the people and supplies to your housekeeper,” Dong Qinghan smiled, the slightly portly face as sly as it was grotesque.

“You mean Qiu Yimeng?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Who else? Young Master, victorious on the battlefield, and successful in love as well—you really are living the high life,” Dong Qinghan said, his envy obvious. “I also heard from my sister there’s a pure and innocent beauty who thinks of you day and night.”

He spoke with scorching envy and jealousy.

Even as a son of a first-rate family, Dong Qinghan found it hard to compete with Yang Kai’s luck with women.

Yang Kai’s heart stirred at this. Just as he was about to ask more, Qiu Yimeng walked in, beaming: “What are you two brothers talking about? I swear I just heard you badmouthing me.”

“Not at all!” Dong Qinghan quickly got up. Before Yang Kai, he could be casual; after all, they were cousins, closer than brothers even. But before Qiu Yimeng, he dared show no disrespect.

Yang Kai chuckled lightly but before speaking, his gaze flickered sharply toward a woman standing beside Qiu Yimeng. His brow furrowed slightly.

This was a rare beauty, black hair like a flowing waterfall, graceful brows like willows, captivating starry eyes, a delicate nose, cheeks faintly flushed pink, cherry lips like twin drops, a flower-shaped face dazzlingly beautiful, skin fairer than frost or snow, an exquisite figure both alluring and enchanting, capable of both charm and coyness.

This beauty’s figure, looks, and bearing were in no way inferior to Qiu Yimeng’s.

However, any stranger’s first glance would not be caught by her face but by the pair of full breasts pressing against her chest.

These twin jade peaks were exceedingly rare, nearly bursting out of her clothes, trembling with supple elasticity.

Next was her slender waist like a water snake, soft and boneless, and her firm, round hips, which seemed to stir enticing ripples with every step.

Yang Kai’s gaze involuntarily lingered a moment on those breasts. Qiu Yimeng noticed his eyes wandering, emitting a subtle huff as she straightened her waist.

Drawing in a breath, Yang Kai raised his eyes just as they met the woman’s watery gaze.

Within those eyes lay happiness, regret, excitement, embarrassment, and a host of emotions.

Yang Kai’s lips curved subtly, and the woman smiled quietly in return.

“Yang Kai, do you still remember this young lady?” Dong Qinghan asked with a grin.

“Of course,” Yang Kai nodded, greeting her: “Senior Sister Lan, long time no see.”

“Yes, it’s been three or four years since last we parted,” the woman replied evenly, rein in the complex emotions in her eyes.

This woman was none other than Lan Chudie, once a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion.

Yang Kai had once bought two seeds of Yang attribute spiritual herbs from her. Later, in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, they traveled together. However, some unpleasant incidents occurred between them, and they went their separate ways.

Afterwards, upon hearing that the Inheritance Celestial Cave had appeared near Lingxiao Pavilion and many disciples had benefited, several first-rate forces sent strongmen to forcibly recruit talents.

Lan Chudie was recruited by Dong Qinghan's Dong Family during that period, and she had gained considerable benefits in the Cave.

At that time, Lan Chudie’s cultivation was only Qi Movement Realm at the Seventh Stage, but now she had reached True Yuan Realm at the Sixth Stage.

Yang Kai had no strong impressions either good or bad of this senior sister. She seemed calculating and competitive, always careful in her dealings.

With time passing, Yang Kai no longer cared much for past minor squabbles. Lan Chudie was alone in Lingxiao Pavilion and, as a woman, it was only natural she would seek power to avoid becoming merely a plaything.

Everyone had their struggles — Yang Kai could understand.

“Senior Sister, your rise in strength has been fast,” Yang Kai complimented.

“Not as good as Junior Brother,” Lan Chudie smiled, “Senior Sister never imagined that I would have a junior brother born in Zhongdu Yang Family. Had I known, I wouldn’t have charged you for those two seeds.”

Her tone was courteous, even somewhat reserved, perhaps a little unsettled by Yang Kai’s changed status.

Qiu Yimeng observed their interaction, sensing the relationship between senior and junior was too flat, lacking the joy of reunion. Though she didn’t know the cause, her shrewdness allowed her to guess some things.

Dong Qinghan laughed and interjected, “Yang Kai, Miss Lan is now a rising star in our Dong Family’s young generation. Many admire her.”

“Is that so?” Yang Kai showed a slight surprise.

“A fast-rising talent and a beauty, you can bet many are fond of her,” Dong Qinghan said casually.

A flush rose on Lan Chudie’s cheeks and she glared at Dong Qinghan: “Young Master Dong, don’t talk nonsense.”

While speaking, she stole glances at Yang Kai’s indifferent reaction and felt a bit disappointed.

“All right, all right,” Qiu Yimeng clapped her hands, interrupting their pointless talk, “Let’s put the reminiscing on hold. Since everyone is here, Yang Kai, why don’t you tell us your plans for the coming days?”

“What plans?” Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

The young lady blinked twice: “You’re the lord of this manor, victorious yesterday with a great triumph. Surely you must have plans for what comes next?”

“What plans would you want?” Yang Kai smiled.

“You could attack your eighth brother, Yang Quan. From what I know, Yang Quan has only one Divine Roaming Realm at the Eighth Stage Blood Servant under his command. With our current strength, we can easily take him out. If you strike first, Qu Gaoyi or Ying Jiu can tie down that Blood Servant, making it effortless to capture him or seize his command flag.”

“You think my brothers are all pushovers?” Yang Kai laughed dryly. “Do you think they’d stand idly by if I attacked Eighth Brother?”

“They’re not pushovers, of course. Sitting back to watch and reap the benefits is something anyone can do, especially when you started it. But besides your eldest brother Yang Wei, who was unharmed last night, the others have lost some strength. In the next few days, they’ll be recruiting and building up their forces; they won’t have spare energy to deal with you. Even if they do, it’d only be some minor harassment. In my opinion, we should move tonight and take your eighth brother out!”

“You’ve got big ambitions.” Yang Kai looked at her with a smile. “I admit you have a point, but I won’t attack Eighth Brother.”

“Why?” Qiu Yimeng looked suspicious. “If you miss this chance, you might never have a better one.”

Dong Qinghan nodded solemnly: “Miss Qiu is right; I think we should act tonight.”

Unable to join the battle last night, he was eager to stir things up.

“Have you not figured out the rules of the succession war? If you defeat Eighth Brother, you’ll have a chance to gain his power. Why hesitate at such a perfect moment?” Qiu Yimeng could not understand. If she were in Yang Kai’s place, she would strike immediately to make a name for herself.

Hearing Yang Kai refuse her proposal left her confused.
