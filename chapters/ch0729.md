## Chapter 729 — Ice Sect

On the glacier, several Ice Sect disciples in snow-white robes were sprinting; they were the very group who had struck the deal with He Pu and the others.

Under the lead of a middle-aged man, the group strode on, their course wavering left and right, unpredictable.

The glacier was littered with ice peaks of all sizes, and clad in white as they were, their means of concealing their qi were remarkably subtle; without careful scrutiny, one could not detect their traces at all.

The middle-aged man at the head ran with the disciples while frowning deeply. He had a constant feeling of being tailed; whenever he opened his Divine Sense to probe, however, he found nothing, which left him increasingly irritable.

After running half a day, not only had they not drawn any closer to the Ice Sect’s location, they were actually moving farther away from it.

At last a young woman at his side could no longer contain herself and asked, “Senior Uncle Ni Ren, why are we running in this direction?”

The middle-aged man gave no answer, as if he had not heard.

The young woman pouted and asked again, “And one more thing — that person just asked after Junior Sister Su Yan. Why did you tell her she wasn’t at the Ice Sect? She clearly is; I saw her a year ago.”

Only then did Ni Ren cast a cold glance at the woman. Under his stare the woman instantly grew terrified and hastily shut her mouth.

A young man beside her tried to soothe her: “Junior Sister, don’t ask. Senior Uncle has his reasons for doing this; it’s for our good. Outsiders are treacherous. That fellow has a rodent’s face and eyes — not someone to be trusted. He came to our Ice Sect to look for someone; who knows what his intentions are.”

“Oh.” The young woman replied once. Though inwardly unconvinced, she dared not press the matter further.

Another disciple, who looked steadier, quickened his pace, drew near to Ni Ren, and asked softly, “Senior Uncle, are we being followed?”

Ni Ren furrowed his brow and said faintly, “I don’t know. It might be my imagination. None among that group should possess the power to track me without my noticing. To be safe, let us detour a bit longer.”

“Yes.”

Ni Ren’s brow remained tightly knitted as he recalled Yang Kai’s appearance, shaking his head repeatedly; he wondered whether he had been overly cautious.

True, the young man looked somewhat exceptional and was not an ordinary talent among the younger generation, but given his age, his cultivation surely could not be exceedingly high.

What unsettled Ni Ren, however, was that the man was searching for Su Yan.

That woman who had inexplicably entered the Ice Sect two years ago!

Not long after joining, she had burst forth with an astonishing, peerless brilliance; the Sect Master and several elders all said that, given time, she would inevitably reach the pinnacle of Saint Realm Third Stage!

Her performance was astonishing. When she joined the Sect she had been at Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage, yet in less than a year she had successfully advanced to the Transcendent Realm. Her cultivation progressed by leaps and bounds. According to Elder Qian Yue, over the past year Su Yan had secluded herself within the Ice-Snow Cave, and nobody knew to what height her cultivation had now risen.

She only glanced at the Ice Sect’s secret scriptures and techniques and instantly mastered them all.

No one in the history of the Ice Sect had ever accomplished such a feat.

Her aptitude approached that of the legendary special constitution — the Ice Crystal Yu Body. Unfortunately, the Ice Crystal Yu Body is far too rare; no one had ever definitively discovered a person who possessed such a constitution.

Ni Ren had had only a few interactions with Su Yan, but from Elder Qian Yue he had learned that a woman like Su Yan was the best candidate for mastering the Ice Sect’s supreme techniques. The Sect Master had accepted her reluctantly, but upon discovering her astounding talent, Elder Qian Yue had formed the intention of taking her as a disciple. He even opened the secret manuals and martial techniques to her and permitted her free access to the forbidden Ice-Snow Cave.

Regrettably, the girl did not seem inclined to fully join the Ice Sect, which left Elder Qian Yue alternating between resentment and affection and truly at a loss.

The mere mention of Su Yan when Yang Kai’s name came up made Ni Ren alert.

Had it been another disciple, Ni Ren might not have concealed the matter, but since it involved Su Yan, he felt it should first be reported to Elder Qian Yue to see what she intended.

With that thought, he kept moving, continuing to weave through the world of glaciers and ice peaks.

Far behind, Yang Kai narrowed his eyes slightly, a cold smile at the corner of his mouth.

The others seemed to have sensed they were being followed but could not be sure, hence their aimless circling in hopes of shaking him off.

But under Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Sense, everything Ni Ren did was in vain.

Three days later Yang Kai noticed the group suddenly vanish into a cluster of ice peaks, their life signatures mysteriously disappearing without a trace.

After waiting a moment, Yang Kai frowned and walked toward that densely packed region of ice peaks.

He searched carefully for a long time but found nothing; he could only conclude that some secret lay hidden within those ice peaks.

What thrilled him, however, was that he sensed Su Yan’s aura!

Because of their practice of the Dual Cultivation Technique, once the two of them were within a certain range they could sense each other’s presence.

Moreover, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng’s energy flowed within both their bodies, strengthening the intangible bond between them.

Su Yan was not far away; she was somewhere inside that cluster of ice peaks. Her aura was even and steady, as if she were in a deep sleep; no matter how Yang Kai transmitted his Divine Sense, he could not elicit a response from her.

Yang Kai’s expression turned instantly dark.

Su Yan had likely met with some misfortune! Otherwise, sensing his arrival, she would certainly have rushed out in excitement.

In an instant a surge of anger rushed through Yang Kai; killing intent flared, and his gaze grew harsh.

Within the ice peak, everything was crystalline and translucent.

The Ice Sect’s foundation lay among these endless ice peaks. Long ago, the Ice Sect had been a widely known power on the Tongxuan Continent, but after an accident the entire Sect relocated and secluded itself here, ceasing contact with the outside world and refusing to accept outsiders.

Every few decades the Ice Sect elders would journey out to seek disciples of exceptional aptitude to bring back, replenishing the Ice Sect’s lifeblood; these candidates were invariably orphans wandering outside without parents.

The strict selection cultivated disciples with formidable talent and ability.

The Ice Sect was not populous — from the Sect Master down there were only about five hundred members — yet it possessed many experts: several Saint Realm masters, and two or three dozen Transcendent Realm cultivators, a testament to the Sect’s formidable training and discerning eye for talent.

At this moment, at the heart of one ice peak, inside an ice chamber, Ni Ren was reporting the details of the transaction to Elder Qian Yue.

Qian Yue was a middle-aged beauty; though she appeared youthful, she was in truth a Saint Realm First Stage expert, and, like Fei Yu, maintained her looks through arts of preservation.

After listening to Ni Ren’s report, Qian Yue nodded slightly. “Well done. Thank you for your efforts. Let those disciples take their supplies and go train on their own.”

“Thank you, Elder.” Ni Ren replied respectfully, but did not immediately withdraw; he looked as though he had something on his mind.

“Is there something else?” Qian Yue’s beautiful eyes appraised him and she perceived something keenly, parting her lips to ask.

“It’s like this, Elder. Something happened during that transaction which made the disciples uneasy.”

“Do tell.”

“A young man asked the disciples after Su Yan’s whereabouts. I don’t know where he got the information, but he seemed to know Su Yan was within our Ice Sect.”

“He came looking for Su Yan?” Qian Yue’s lovely face turned stern and her brows knit. “What sort of man was he?”

Ni Ren hurriedly described Yang Kai’s appearance, adding, “He was young but strange. I could not ascertain his strength. Yet he gave me a feeling of pressure.”

“He pressured you?” Qian Yue looked surprised, thought for a moment, and murmured, “Could he be the fellow that old man mentioned to the Sect Master long ago? How did he arrive so quickly?”

When that old man had delivered Su Yan to the Ice Sect for the Sect Master, he had said that one day a young man would come searching for her, and at that time the Sect Master must let her go, otherwise immense trouble might result.

Back then neither the Sect Master nor she knew Su Yan’s aptitude was so outstanding, and they had agreed begrudgingly. But now, after witnessing Su Yan’s brilliance, Qian Yue truly did not want her to leave. If she remained in the Ice Sect, with her talent she could inherit the Sect Master’s position and become a leader of the sect.

What made Qian Yue most helpless of all was that Su Yan was currently in a state in which she should not be seen.

The young man’s relationship with Su Yan must be extraordinarily intimate; if he were to see Su Yan in her present condition, who could say what trouble would erupt.

Qian Yue rubbed her forehead, very troubled, and asked, “Has that man come to the Ice Sect?”

“No.” Ni Ren shook his head. “I thought it best to first report to the elder, so I did not tell him the full truth.”

“Good. Well done.” Qian Yue nodded satisfactorily, about to offer some praise, when her expression suddenly changed. She released her Divine Sense to probe and snorted coldly: “Ni Ren, Ni Ren, you truly are incompetent! That fellow followed you all the way here to our Ice Sect, and you didn’t detect him at all?”

“Ah?” Ni Ren was shocked. “Impossible. I deliberately circled outside for several days and was certain there were no problems before returning. How could he—”

“Humph!” Qian Yue snorted. “I tell you he came. And that brat seems to harbor strong resentment toward our Ice Sect; his aura is somewhat violent at present.”

“Elder, please calm down. I will drive him away at once!” Ni Ren hurriedly said, irritation apparent on his face.

He had been cautious when returning but had still been tracked to the doorstep; the embarrassment stung.

“Go, and take more people. That brat is no good; give him a proper lesson, but do not kill him.” Qian Yue warned. After all, the old man had some connections, and if they killed him it would be hard to explain before that old man and the Sect Master.

The Sect Master had already rebuked Qian Yue once over Su Yan’s mishap; Qian Yue did not want to be lectured again.

Ni Ren hastily acknowledged the order, bowed, and withdrew, his expression as cold as ice.
