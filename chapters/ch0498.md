## Chapter 498 — Capture

At Yang Kai’s residence, the disturbing sounds of Di Mo’s eerie laughter and shouts had already alerted everyone.

By the time Yang Kai arrived, he was shocked to find a certain area not far from the pill workshop tightly surrounded by the estate’s martial artists, forming three concentric rings. Each martial artist’s True Yuan fluctuated erratically, their faces filled with vigilance and apprehension as they stared toward the center.

Seeing Yang Kai approach, they respectfully parted to make a path, greeting him with deference.

Yang Kai nodded faintly, his expression composed as he strode inward.

In the innermost circle, Qiu Yimeng and the others gathered around Di Mo, all wearing expressions of profound curiosity and astonishment as they observed the scene ahead.

“Young Master, she’s here!” Di Mo’s tone held a trace of excitement as he spoke, extending a hand to point forward.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. About five zhang away, a few towering red beams of light ascended from the ground like glowing iron pillars, forming a circle. Within that circle, a faint, almost transparent figure was struggling wildly, yet it remained trapped within the restraints of the red light.

Everyone watched in amazement, even Qiu Yimeng and the others were utterly shocked.

This figure wrapped in red light was nearly invisible; without careful observation, her presence was nearly imperceptible. As she moved, it seemed as though a stream of crystal-clear water flowed through the air, slightly distorting the view beyond.

Up until now, no one had discerned her true form.

This technique had completely surpassed their knowledge and understanding!

Ying Jiu, also an expert in concealment and assassination, could fade his figure into the air using special techniques and True Yuan manipulation to be overlooked by others.

But this mysterious person was different. She was plainly there, yet everyone failed to see her!

Yang Kai’s expression stiffened; he realized he had underestimated this mysterious expert’s abilities.

This shadowy master had appeared twice before in Yang Kai’s presence, yet each time she had escaped unscathed. The last time was at Po Jing Lake, where Yang Kai managed to snip a strand of her hair and gave it to Di Mo to track her down.

After diligent efforts, only today had Di Mo sensed this mysterious expert’s aura and immediately used a powerful divine technique to trap her.

Even confined, she showed no signs of worry, casually pacing back and forth within the small circle of red light. Faintly, it seemed she was observing the surrounding crowd.

“Eh… is it a woman?” Qiu Yimeng was stunned. She had caught a glimpse of the figure’s two full mounds at her chest. Though only a flash, it confirmed her gender.

“Miss, reveal your true visage.” Yang Kai’s face was stern as he calmly ordered.

There was no response, no movement to reveal herself. She simply stood quietly. Yang Kai felt a pair of eyes fixed unblinkingly on him.

“I have some questions I wish to ask; please cooperate.” Yang Kai frowned.

Still no answer.

His patience began to wane. Yang Kai did not know what this person was trying to achieve by sneaking around the pill workshop, nor who had hired her. But allowing such a figure to run rampant would only sow fear among his people. And now, with the woman refusing any cooperation, Yang Kai saw no point in continuing this dialogue.

“I’ll give you ten breaths to think it over!” His tone grew colder as he spoke, then silently waited.

Soon, ten breaths had passed.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head and looked toward the figure’s location. With a cold voice, he said, “Make your move. If she resists, killing her will cause no harm.”

Di Mo let out a wicked chuckle and stepped forward. The figure wrapped in red light seemed unprepared for Yang Kai’s ruthlessness; she solidified momentarily but then faded once again from sight.

“Collect!” Di Mo barked sharply. The red beams suddenly contracted toward the center, radiating a bizarre and sinister aura.

“Hmph, do you honestly think you can capture me?” Just as the red lights were about to bind the woman, she suddenly spoke.

Her voice startled everyone.

Not because it was particularly beautiful or ugly, but because it sounded very young and tender.

As people age, their body, appearance, and voice all undergo subtle changes. The qualities of sound between old and young are different.

This mysterious expert’s voice was pure, crisp, and young, leading everyone to involuntarily associate her with a girl barely in her twenties.

Yet soon they shook their heads in disbelief.

A girl in her early twenties couldn’t possibly possess such profound cultivation and powerful skills! Even Qiu Yimeng was only in the First Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, at twenty-two or twenty-three.

Liu Qingyao was even older.

Could this woman’s talent really surpass theirs so fantastically? Maybe her voice was naturally youthful, they guessed.

No sooner had the mysterious woman finished speaking when Di Mo’s expression abruptly turned grim. Without hesitation, he pulled an object from his bosom.

At the same time, accompanied by the woman’s gleeful laughter, her figure trapped within the red light suddenly exploded.

Yang Kai took a swift step forward, slapping a Hand Seal to snatch at the spot.

He had seen this happen twice before, each time this expert escaped the same way.

His Hand Seal struck only mist. The woman visibly vanished under everyone’s watchful eyes.

Everyone present was moved to silence.

This place gathered young martial artists from the next generation, several experts from the Divine Roaming Realm, and a few Yang Family Blood Servants. Yet no one could fathom how she had escaped.

Di Mo, however, appeared exhilarated, tightly clutching the object he pulled out earlier. Infusing it with True Yuan, the oddly shaped item suddenly brightened.

“Capture!” Di Mo said softly. The object turned into a streak of light and vanished instantly, speeding toward a certain direction in the War City.

“Heh heh, I knew she would play this card!” Di Mo smiled proudly, watching the light disappear.

“Are you sure?” Yang Kai asked, glancing briefly at the item. It was made from that pale blue hair he gave Di Mo last time.

“Rest assured, you just wait,” Di Mo said confidently.

Yang Kai lightly nodded. Several Blood Servants looked at Di Mo oddly. They were not naive, yet the methods Di Mo used were unheard of. They grew curious about his background.

In War City, inside the Wind Guest Inn’s main room, a young girl slowly opened her beautiful eyes and puckered her crimson lips.

“Really irritating, they’ve been lying in wait like this, shameless to the extreme. I’m not here to do harm, just wanted to find someone, and it’s infuriating,” she grumbled.

Three times now she had encountered that man who seemed even younger than her, and twice he had seen through her concealment. She was somewhat annoyed.

How could such a powerful youth exist in this barbaric land? His strength was still lacking. If he weren’t born here but from her homeland, he would surely achieve great things. But since he was born here, his potential was limited.

Thoughts like these brought a faint joy to the girl’s heart, a sort of schadenfreude over Yang Kai’s humble origins.

Suddenly—

Whoosh—

A sharp rush of air swept past her ears, and her skin tightened. A dangerous sensation approached, chilling her to the bone and making her suddenly uneasy.

Before she could understand what was happening, a streak of light shot through the window and struck her body.

“Ouch…” Taken off guard, the girl fell onto the ground. When she got up, the light had vanished.

She found no trace of injury but sensed something was missing.

What was missing? She searched carefully several times but found nothing. Puzzled, she shook her head softly and tapped her red lips in confusion.

Back at Yang Kai’s estate, after his order, everyone had dispersed.

Only Di Mo remained.

The master and servant waited silently.

After a long time, a flash of light flickered past Yang Kai’s eyes. Di Mo reached out and caught it, examining it carefully before exclaiming, “Young Master, it’s done!”

He handed the item over while speaking.

Yang Kai took it and examined it closely, letting out a wry smile.

He had only glanced casually earlier and paid no attention to what Di Mo had crafted from the woman’s hair. Now it was clear—it was a small figurine.

Di Mo possessed such craftsmanship! The doll’s features were naturally blurred, but its limbs were complete; a crude model at best.

At present, a faint glow surrounded the doll, with obscure energy swirling within.

“Young Master, this is a soul binding curse the old servant made! This doll connects directly to the woman’s energy and spirit. If you do anything to this doll, no matter how far she is, she will feel it as if it were happening to her.”

“Should I just twist its neck?” Yang Kai glanced at Di Mo.

“Then the woman is as good as dead!” Di Mo chuckled, “Right now, she is completely controlled by you, Young Master.”

“Good!” A trace of satisfaction appeared on Yang Kai’s face.

Di Mo laughed nervously, “This curse was invented when the old servant was researching ways to control my subordinates. Ah, I suddenly recalled it just now.”

“So, life wasn’t easy for you before. Using such means to control your subordinates, who would willingly serve you?”

“Yes, yes, I had no choice.”

Yang Kai shook his head, dropping the matter. He stretched out a hand, curling his middle finger to gently flick the doll’s forehead.
