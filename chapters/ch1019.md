## Chapter 1019 — Will Serve People

"Not bad at your craft." Yang Kai was taken aback.

"As long as Master likes it." Bi Ya breathed sweetly in Yang Kai's ear, sounding a little pitiable. "I have no other skills, I only know how to serve people."

"Serve men?" Yang Kai chuckled.

Bi Ya giggled, unfazed by Yang Kai's teasing.

"Enough, don't try your charms on me. Your cheap seduction tricks won't work on me." Yang Kai snapped impatiently.

Bi Ya froze, hastily restraining her coquettishness and forced a smile. "I'm used to it, Master, please don't be angry!"

"If I wanted a woman, there are two inexperienced girls in the stone chamber beside us. Your trying to seduce me won't do any good."

"Master thinks my body is unclean…" Bi Ya gave a bitter smile, then suddenly said, "Do you want me to train those two girls? I'm very skilled at disciplining women. I guarantee they'll be unable to resist Master's charm, will willingly give themselves body and soul, not only allowing you free rein but actively seeking you out."

Yang Kai's face darkened. "I regret having kept you around!"

Bi Ya immediately fell silent and obediently served Yang Kai, deliberately pressing her hot, supple body and astonishingly firm, full breasts against his back.

After a while, Yang Kai waved his hand. "You may leave. Find a place to live on your own. If I need you I'll call. Do not enter here without my order."

"Yes!" Bi Ya rose gracefully, her shapely hips swaying as she left.

Inside the adjacent stone chamber, He Miao pressed her ear to the rock wall and suddenly spat angrily, "Sister, Yang Kai actually paired up with that Bi Ya woman—what an utter shamelessness. From now on we really should keep an eye on him!"

He Zao sat cross-legged on the ground, remaining silent.

……

Ghost Ancestor had not shown his face for half a month straight; no one knew what he had been doing.

During this time, Yang Kai devoted himself entirely to cultivation, his mind undistracted.

In the stone chambers within the mountain, He Zao, He Miao, Shen Tu and Bi Ya all lived peacefully, especially Bi Ya, who, having submitted to Yang Kai, had abandoned her former licentious ways. She became more obedient than anyone and no longer behaved flirtatiously.

Unless summoned by Yang Kai, she stayed shut inside her chamber.

She knew clearly she could not move someone like Ghost Ancestor. To live, she had to work on Yang Kai; if Yang Kai was pleased, she might have a chance to survive.

To prove her determination, she had even broken with Lü Guichen and handed over the compass treasure used to contact Purple Star warriors to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had summoned her several times but never made a move. Bi Ya found this perplexing; she wondered if Yang Kai had some problem in that area, otherwise why was he completely indifferent to female charms?

She made herself available, would not resist—yet he felt nothing?

Young men were full of vigor; their desires in that regard were usually stronger than anyone else's. Could there be a physical problem with him?

Bi Ya grew suspicious and paranoid. Her gaze toward Yang Kai changed; she even felt a touch of pity for him.

One day while Yang Kai was cultivating, he suddenly sensed something amiss. He hurriedly opened his eyes and saw Ghost Ancestor standing quietly before him, his gaze fixed on him with a shifting expression.

Yang Kai's body stiffened and his heart froze.

His Divine Sense was now impressive, yet he still couldn't tell when Ghost Ancestor had arrived; this old devil's cultivation was truly beyond nature.

"Elder, have you need of me?" Yang Kai asked.

"Boy, have you forgotten your task?" Ghost Ancestor said with displeasure. "I brought you here not so you could simply raise your strength."

"I haven't forgotten. It's just that the spatial domain fields of this continent aren't stable yet. Even if I tore open space I couldn't probe much," Yang Kai replied calmly, then after a moment added, "But if you're anxious, I can go investigate other matters."

"Other matters?" Ghost Ancestor looked puzzled.

"That seven-colored sky… If I'm not mistaken, that sky is the cage binding this continent. It's because of it that you cannot leave."

"Correct." Ghost Ancestor's eyes brightened and he nodded heavily. "You have some insight. The sky of this continent is composed of various domain fields from the Chaos Abyss, stranger even than the Chaos Abyss itself, disorienting anyone who tries to find direction, so no one can fly away from this continent. I'm surprised you noticed this; since you did, go and investigate."

Saying this, he seized Yang Kai and like lightning they left the mountain, arriving high above the continent.

When Yang Kai came to his senses he found himself thousands of zhang above the land.

"Look carefully and see what else you can discern," Ghost Ancestor said lightly, standing beside him.

Yang Kai nodded and released his Divine Sense, letting it spread in all directions.

After a moment, he frowned and said, “It’s indeed chaotic here. Even when extending my Divine Sense, I can’t find the right direction. The overlapping domain fields are disrupting all sense of orientation. Senior, can you estimate how far this field extends?”

Ghost Ancestor pondered and said, "This continent isn't that large, so the chaotic field's range shouldn't be too vast—perhaps thousands to tens of thousands of li."

"I can tear space at most six or seven hundred li in one go… If the field is that large, it means I'd need to rip space a dozen times at least to clear the coverage, and I can't make a mistake even once!" Yang Kai frowned and shook his head. "That's difficult."

"If you think it's difficult, why keep you?" Ghost Ancestor sneered. "I might as well kill you now and use soul-search techniques to probe your memories, then I'll figure it out myself!"

Yang Kai chuckled. "That's a last resort. You wouldn't do that unless absolutely necessary, would you?"

Ghost Ancestor snorted.

"This matter can't be rushed. Wait another half month. After that the continent's spatial domain fields should stabilize, and I'll think of a way."

“We’ve no other choice, then,” Ghost Ancestor said with a helpless nod.

"Do you have any further orders? If not, I'll take my leave."

"Wait!" Ghost Ancestor raised a hand, then suddenly placed his palm on Yang Kai's shoulder. In the next moment an extreme chill surged into Yang Kai's body like a swarm of locusts, sweeping through every inch of his flesh and examining him inside and out.

Yang Kai's expression changed; he didn't understand why Ghost Ancestor suddenly did this.

A moment later Ghost Ancestor's expression shifted and with a gesture something appeared in his hand.

The Demon God's Secret Codex!

Yang Kai's face darkened, his eyes sharp with alertness as he stared at Ghost Ancestor.

"Did you think I couldn't sense the presence of this storage treasure within you?" Ghost Ancestor sneered. "I simply chose not to pay attention. But this thing seems odd. Where did you obtain it?"

"From the continent I was born on." Yang Kai answered honestly.

"There was originally a legacy within it?" Ghost Ancestor asked further.

"Yes!" Yang Kai was inwardly startled but kept his face calm.

"No wonder there are two completely different kinds of power within you… and some inexplicable external forces as well."

Yang Kai understood; the external forces Ghost Ancestor spoke of were the dragon emperor and phoenix empress patterns on his body.

"Have you ever considered fusing these two distinct powers?" Ghost Ancestor suddenly asked.

"Fusing them together?" Yang Kai was stunned.

"Exactly. You can call upon two different powers, but isn't that inconvenient? Their attributes oppose each other; whenever you use one, the other must be set aside temporarily."

"Indeed."

"If you could fuse these two powers, your strength would undergo earth-shattering change!"

"How to do that? Please instruct me, Elder!" Yang Kai cried out, energized by Ghost Ancestor's words; he felt a new horizon opening before him.

The old man rolled his eyes. "How should I know? It's your problem to solve. But I did witness someone once perfectly fuse ice and fire powers. That person was a freak. Whether you can do it depends on your effort; I can't help—I have no experience."

Yang Kai smiled bitterly. "Then why tell me at all?"

"Because the stronger you become, the better our chances of leaving this place. And even if you grow strong, you still can't escape my grasp, so I'm not worried about your rise—rather, I'm somewhat anticipating it." He chuckled, showing he didn't take Yang Kai seriously.

"That makes sense." Yang Kai forced a wry smile and nodded.

A Star Lord of the Void King Realm would not trouble himself over a small game like Yang Kai.

"Huh, inside your storage treasure there's even a strange tree. It must have taken thousands of years to reach that size," Ghost Ancestor exclaimed as his Divine Sense probed the Demon God's Secret Codex and marveled at the presence of the Divine Tree.

He paid no heed to Yang Kai's sour expression and continued to pry into the secrets within the codex.

"What are these spirit liquids, spirit milk, spirit salves? They seem quite good. This salve appears to be Saint King-Grade." Ghost Ancestor kept exclaiming.

"Elder, could you return my things?" Yang Kai's face grew dark as a sense of helplessness settled over him.

Ghost Ancestor snorted. "You think I'd covet your treasures? Don't worry—what's valuable to you might be useless to me. Hmm, I won't take them…"

He said this while continuing his examination.

Suddenly his expression changed and he cried out, "You actually have this?"

"What?" Yang Kai was bewildered. He didn't understand what Ghost Ancestor had spotted inside the Demon God's Secret Codex that had made him react as if he'd seen a ghost.

"Where did you get this?" Ghost Ancestor reached out, and three stones appeared in his hand.

One was entirely blood-red, brimming with dense blood energy—the Blood Essence Stone Yang Kai had previously obtained.

The other two were those peculiar jet-black spheres, their surfaces covered in vein-like patterns like human meridians; if one listened closely they seemed to pulse rhythmically from within.
