## Chapter 1277 — Glazed Pearl

Deep beneath Qianhuan Peak, a thousand zhang down, beside the three-zhang-square Yin Pool, Yang Kai sat cross‑legged, his brow slightly furrowed and eyes full of contemplation, idly turning over a dull, gray, unremarkable bead in his hand.

The work of expelling the Glaze Poison from Daiyuan had already been completed; fortune had smiled upon her and she had managed to survive the last critical moments, successfully purging the Glaze Poison from her body. Just before she sank into a deep faint she suddenly spat out a bead like this and only had time to tell Yang Kai that it was a Glaze Pearl before collapsing.

Yang Kai hauled her out of the Yin Pool, circulated his Saint Yuan to steam away the yin-cold qi clinging to her, took off his own clothes to cover her, and then stayed by her side the whole time.

If he could, Yang Kai would have liked to carry her back to his room to rest, but she was wearing nothing more than undergarments, and the idea of lifting her up in that state felt awkward.

There was nothing special about the bead at first glance — toss it aside and no one would notice — but when Yang Kai examined it carefully he was shocked to discover that inside the drab exterior countless rays of colored light shimmered. That radiance was exactly the same as the Glazed Light, possessing the power to bind the body and seize the soul; it could easily pierce the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness and unsettle his spirit.

Yang Kai instantly understood that such a bead must be an item of great value.

Although Yang Kai had never personally seen the Thousand Illusions Glaze, he had a vague notion that this bead’s formation was related to the Thousand Illusions Glaze Daiyuan had ingested and the cultivation method she practiced. After examining it countless times he found something strange: the bead resembled a pill in some ways, yet also looked like a material used for forging — it sat somewhere between the two and was difficult to classify.

As he toyed with it, Yang Kai’s expression shifted and he held the Glazed Pearl in his palm, glancing toward Daiyuan, who lay on the ground nearby.

There, Daiyuan’s long lashes trembled gently and the ten delicate fingers of her hands gave the faintest movement; it was clearly the sign that she was about to wake.

Staring at her face, so utterly different from before, Yang Kai could not help but be moved. Before the Glaze Poison had been expelled, Daiyuan’s appearance had been unbearable to behold; now she had become a peerless beauty, even slightly surpassing Yin Sudie.

Yang Kai wondered whether he could have kept his composure had she entered the Yin Pool in this very form to begin with. After thinking it over he admitted to himself that any man would be distracted — after all, however upright a man might be, no one would remain unmoved when faced with such a beauty who was practically unclothed.

After a while, Daiyuan finally opened her eyes and moved slightly; discovering how weak she was, she let out a low groan.

Yang Kai’s calm voice carried over: "Now that you’re awake, take it easy and recuperate — your condition isn’t good."

Hearing him, Daiyuan lowered her eyelids and at once saw Yang Kai sitting not far from her, smiling as he watched her. Her expression shifted and she tried to speak, but no words would come forth.

When she noticed that Yang Kai’s long robe was not being worn and that something was draped over her, a flicker of safety and gratitude passed through her beautiful eyes. She then closed them again and silently circulated her Saint Yuan.

Two hours later Daiyuan was able to sit up. After dressing, she took many prepared restorative medicines from her Spatial Ring, swallowed them, and resumed meditative recuperation.

A full day later she exhaled deeply and opened her eyes; a lively sparkle had returned to them, and her cultivation seemed to have improved somewhat. Though her face remained a little pale, she was no longer in any grave danger — with calm recuperation she would surely recover.

She rose gracefully and came before Yang Kai, offering a deep bow: "Daiyuan thanks Junior Brother Yang Kai. Had it not been for Junior Brother Yang Kai’s help this time, I would likely have perished. Junior Brother Yang Kai’s great kindness shall be remembered by Daiyuan for the rest of her life."

Yang Kai rose as well and, smiling as he waved a hand, said coolly, "You getting through that gate of death was your own effort; I didn’t do much."

Daiyuan shook her head slowly. "Junior Brother Yang Kai holds me in too high regard. I know myself — if the person summoned this time had been Master Xiao or one of the elders from the Medicine Pill Sect, I absolutely wouldn’t be standing here now. Not to mention that the bottle of potion you gave me must have used many precious ingredients; without that concoction I couldn’t have made it through those last hours."

She could clearly feel that after taking the Blood Zhi Mushroom and that bottle of potion her depleted life root had recovered a great deal, and even continued to slowly increase over time.

Because of that she had been able to persevere to the end; otherwise she would have died halfway through.

Simply consuming a raw Blood Zhi Mushroom would not have such an effect; a refined Blood Zhi Pill might, but an unrefined Blood Zhi Mushroom probably could not, so the true cause must lie in that unknown bottle of potion.

Although she did not know how much trouble Yang Kai had taken to prepare that potion, it was obviously no ordinary thing. Yang Kai did not mention it, but Daiyuan would not forget such a debt.

Yang Kai neither denied nor admitted it.

What Daiyuan did not know was that the main ingredient in that potion was a single drop of his Golden Blood. Yang Kai’s Golden Blood contained an extraordinarily potent life force and qi-and-blood power, perfectly suited to replenish her life root at that moment.

"In any case, Miss Daiyuan, you made it — congratulations!" Yang Kai laughed lightly and changed the subject.

Daiyuan smiled charmingly and turned to gaze at the reflection of that peerless face in the still water of the Yin Pool; a sheen of watery color rose in her lovely eyes.

Yang Kai watched her and, knowing how to read the moment, kept silent so she could savor the joy and excitement of seeing her beauty restored.

After a while Daiyuan suddenly swept her hand, and a gust from her sleeve ruffled the clear pool water, shattering that face which would have made any man’s heart beat faster.

Then Daiyuan circulated her Saint Yuan, and under Yang Kai’s stunned gaze that exquisite visage reverted once more to the appearance Yang Kai had first seen — hideous, withered skin pocked and scabbed, a sight no one could bear to look upon.

Yang Kai’s brow tightened.

No woman does not love beauty; Daiyuan was no exception. Otherwise she would not have lost her composure at the provocation from the Battle Sky Alliance when she was in the Flowing Flame Sandland, nor would she have shown such a wistful expression earlier.

Yet since she did this there must be a reason, and Yang Kai did not press her further. What piqued his curiosity was that when he swept his Divine Sense over her face he could not find the slightest flaw — Daiyuan’s ugliness truly seemed to have returned.

This greatly surprised him, for he had personally seen Daiyuan’s true colors before.

Yang Kai did not ask, yet Daiyuan took the initiative to explain: “Junior Brother Yang, please don’t laugh at me. I feel that it is not yet the right time to reveal this matter, so I can only mislead others for now. Once I advance to the Origin Returning Realm, it won’t be too late to report everything to my Master.”

"You have considered this carefully — that is right," Yang Kai agreed with a nod, then changed the subject and asked, "May I ask, Miss Daiyuan, what use this bead has?"

As he spoke he produced the Glazed Pearl from his hand.

Daiyuan looked at the Glazed Pearl and smiled faintly: "Ah, I forgot to explain when I spat it out before; I was too occupied with cleansing the toxin. This bead, to me, is somewhat like the inner core of a demonic beast."

"Inner Core?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

"Yes. The Thousand Illusions Glaze method was created based on the cultivation methods of demonic beasts. Junior Brother Yang Kai should know that some demonic beasts can naturally swallow and refine minerals, condensing essence in their natures and storing it in their inner cores. After I began to practice the Thousand Illusions Glaze and ingested the elixir, something like that formed within my body."

Yang Kai was astonished and hurriedly asked, "If that is so, now that you have lost it will it have any effect on you?"

"There will be an effect, but it won’t be great. It’s only something similar to an inner core — not as critical as an inner core is to a demonic beast. Given enough time and enough of the Thousand Illusions Glaze elixirs, I can still produce such a thing again."

Hearing this, Yang Kai finally relaxed, though he could not help but marvel at the genius who created the Thousand Illusions Glaze. To cause a martial artist’s body to produce something akin to a demonic beast’s inner core was extraordinary. No wonder when he examined the bead it had seemed part pill and part forging material — now he understood why.

Daiyuan looked at Yang Kai with a smile, her breath fragrant as orchids: "Though this Glazed Pearl is important to me, it is not indispensable. To Junior Brother Yang Kai, however, it could prove very useful."

"Oh? Please explain, Miss Daiyuan!" Yang Kai’s expression sharpened. He had probed and pondered the bead for a long time and had thought of asking Yang Yan, but hearing Daiyuan speak now it seemed she might know how to handle it.

"If Junior Brother Yang Kai were to refine this Glazed Pearl, you might be able to glean some profound truths from it. After all, this contains the condensed essence of the Thousand Illusions Glaze; if you truly comprehend the mysteries of the Glazed Light, you will gain an additional means against your enemies. I estimate, given your talent, you would have about an eighty percent chance of refining it."

"Glazed Light!" Yang Kai’s expression changed. When he had been helping Daiyuan purge the poison he had suffered a little at the power of the Glazed Light and thus knew just how devastating those myriad rays could be. Aside from those who practiced the Thousand Illusions Glaze, no other martial artist could hope to comprehend the Glazed Light, yet now it might be possible through this Glazed Pearl — Yang Kai could not help but feel wildly elated.
