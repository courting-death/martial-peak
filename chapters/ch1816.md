## Chapter 1816 — Self-Destruction

Right now it was almost certainly a death sentence; Zi Long knew there was no way he could escape.

A trace of unwillingness flashed across his eyes; he glared at Yang Kai with venomous hatred, then formed a hand seal and his face flushed crimson as his whole body swelled like a balloon, veins bulging grotesquely, while wildly turbulent fluctuations of energy poured from him.

"Bad—this fellow is going to self-destruct!" the Ghost Ancestor's expression changed dramatically, and the soles of his feet even began to cramp.

Although he was some ten li away from Zi Long at that moment, a Second Stage of the Void King Realm's self-destruction was not something that distance could neutralize; if Zi Long truly detonated, the void for hundreds of li around might be swallowed.

The Ghost Ancestor could not guarantee he would remain unscathed in such circumstances.

He immediately realized Zi Long had indeed been driven to a dead end, otherwise why would a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert choose such a decisive course?

"Delusional!" Yang Kai's face was extremely grave; he reached out and produced a pale cyan bead, into which he madly poured his own Saint Yuan and Divine Sense.

In the space of a single breath, Yang Kai appeared to grow faint, while the pale cyan bead only gave off a faint glow.

"Go!" Yang Kai flicked his finger across the bead and a hair-thin arc of lightning shot forth from it, streaking straight for Zi Long.

Cold sweat dripped down the Ghost Ancestor's forehead and his eyes nearly popped out as he stared dumbly at that seemingly insignificant arc of lightning, his heart trembling violently.

For from it he felt an aura of destruction, a force that made him unable to summon any will to resist.

That power seemed to transcend the Void King Realm itself, as if it governed that piece of heaven and earth.

"Heh heh, at the end of your rope? Even if I die you won't have it easy!" Zi Long sneered cruelly, mocking the faint arc of lightning coming from Yang Kai, believing Yang Kai had exhausted his strength.

But he only saw Yang Kai regarding him with a similarly mocking glare.

Zi Long's brow furrowed, and at that moment the hair-thin arc suddenly raced before him, flashing past his eyes.

The next instant Zi Long felt his whole body go numb, as if struck by divine thunder from the ninth heavens, his mind freezing.

Out of the corner of his eye he saw countless arcs of lightning crawling across his body like spirit snakes, and under their destructive power the physical body he had relied on as a Second Stage of the Void King Realm began to fracture and collapse; his strength dissolved like snow under the scorching sun.

His swollen body shriveled with terrifying speed.

"This… impossible!" Zi Long snarled in unwillingness.

In the next moment, Xiaoxiao's Heaven-Shaking Pillar slammed down and the Fire Bird Liu Yan's thunderfire engulfed him.

Three breaths later the dust settled and the place where Zi Long had stood was empty; the Purple Star's master had been reduced to skeletal dust, leaving only his Spatial Ring, which was shot away by the force.

Liu Yan transformed back into humanoid form and chased after the Spatial Ring.

"Pfft…" Yang Kai spat a mouthful of blood, his face ashen; he sat cross-legged in the void, took out a Spiritual Pill and popped it into his mouth, then circulated his cultivation to heal.

The Ghost Ancestor stood to one side, stunned and dazed.

He had watched the whole fight from beginning to end; although at first he and Yang Kai had jointly wounded Zi Long, in the final moments he had contributed nothing—put another way, Yang Kai deserved roughly eighty percent of the credit for killing Zi Long.

Perhaps… even without his help, Yang Kai could have achieved this.

That thought suddenly frightened the Ghost Ancestor.

A newly advanced Void King Realm cultivator could actually kill someone like Zi Long? This kid… was he even human?

The Ghost Ancestor stared at Yang Kai as if looking at a monster.

What astonished him even more was that pale cyan bead Yang Kai had used at the last moment—without question it was an extraordinary Secret Treasure, though the Ghost Ancestor could not discern its grade.

As he stood there dazed, Xiaoxiao and the Fire Bird returned together, flanking him and glaring with hostile eyes.

"What are you doing?" the Ghost Ancestor's mouth twitched. "I am the Grand Elder of Lingxiao Sect and on the same side as your master—don't look at me like I'm about to do him harm."

He knew Xiaoxiao and the Fire Bird's vigilance was entirely due to Yang Kai recuperating, so he had no intention of arguing.

But Xiaoxiao and the Fire Bird remained unmoved, standing their ground as if prepared to kill the Ghost Ancestor at the slightest provocation.

"No rudeness!" a buzzing sound suddenly echoed, almost deafening. "You two, stand down for now."

Hearing the shout, Liu Yan immediately stepped aside without hesitation, while Xiaoxiao scratched its head, looking a little dazed. Seeing it like that, Liu Yan reached out, pulled it to her side, and knocked lightly on its head.

Xiaoxiao lowered its head in grievance.

The Ghost Ancestor gaped and looked up to see a towering Incarnation stepping toward him, each footfall shaking the void like a small mountain; he asked in astonishment and doubt, "Did you just speak?"

Then, like a cat with its tail trodden on, he exclaimed, "You can speak?"

"Why couldn't I?" the Incarnation chuckled like thunder, a hilariously expressive smile on a face very similar to Yang Kai's. "Grand Elder, did you think this body was a dead thing?"

"You called me Grand Elder?" the Ghost Ancestor frowned. "So you're Yang Kai."

"Sort of—I can represent the main body," the Incarnation nodded slightly, then frowned. "This body is too large; it's awkward to move."

"It is a bit big…" the Ghost Ancestor wiped the cold sweat from his brow. Though he knew the Incarnation was Yang Kai, seeing such a huge figure approaching with such varied expression still weighed on him like a mountain.

“The main body just overexerted itself a bit. It should wake up soon. No need to worry, Grand Elder,” the Incarnation said, seeming to realize its voice was too loud and deliberately lowering it.

I am not worried at all! the Ghost Ancestor cried inwardly. He could plainly see Yang Kai's true state, yet this battle had shown him so many shocks that his thoughts were in disarray.

"Boy, didn't your main body just ascend to the Void King Realm? How did he suddenly become the peak of the First Stage? If he gets more opportunities he might attempt to break to the Second Stage," the Ghost Ancestor asked angrily, remembering how he had lingered on the Floating Continent for two thousand years and by chance advanced to the Void King Realm, then spent five hundred years without progress until leaving the Floating Continent and finally breaking through.

Yang Kai had gone away for a few months and already reached the peak of the First Stage; he bitterly lamented the injustice of heaven—talent envied by the heavens.

"Main body's situation has something to do with me," the Incarnation finally settled before the Ghost Ancestor, sat cross-legged and looked down at him, propping up a thick finger and pointing to itself. "Because of my birth, the main body was able to breakthrough again after ascending."

The Ghost Ancestor's brow knitted into a stream-like frown as he muttered, "How profound…"

"Heh heh, put it this way—when I prosper, the main body prospers; my power can feed back to the main body."

"I understand," the Ghost Ancestor rubbed his sore neck. "But how does one cultivate an Incarnation?"

This was the part that piqued the Ghost Ancestor's interest: the notion of an external incarnation existed only in legend, and he yearned to cultivate one—if he could, his strength would soar.

"If Grand Elder wishes to cultivate it, I can teach you."

"How can I accept that?" the Ghost Ancestor rejoiced, rubbing his hands, speaking modestly while showing no embarrassment on his face.

The Incarnation chuckled and said, "Do you recall the time on the Floating Continent when you had the main body enter that Space Array to investigate?"

The Ghost Ancestor's face turned sheepish. "That was a thing of the past—why bring it up?"

At that time he had not been very friendly toward Yang Kai.

"The main body did not go into that Space Array himself; he sent a strand of Soul Incarnation in…" the Incarnation smiled at the Ghost Ancestor.

The Ghost Ancestor considered it and said, "You mean…"

"Exactly. That strand of Soul Incarnation became me today," the Incarnation nodded lightly. "To cultivate an Incarnation one must first cultivate a Soul Incarnation; when the Soul Incarnation grows strong, one finds a suitable body and enters it—then an Incarnation is born."

"Is it that simple?" the Ghost Ancestor asked in astonishment.

"It is that simple," the Incarnation smiled faintly, "but… simple does not guarantee success."

"Please, explain." the Ghost Ancestor asked humbly.

"Besides how difficult it is to find a suitable body, even if one is found there is no certainty the Soul Incarnation will successfully fuse with it; after all, it resembles possession. And even if successful, the Incarnation need not be terribly strong—against someone of the Grand Elder's calibre an Incarnation may not be of much use."

"But yours…" the Ghost Ancestor was puzzled. Though he could not fathom the Incarnation's origins, from the palm strike that had surprised Zi Long the Incarnation's combat power clearly rivaled, if not exceeded, a Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

"Mine is an exception—too many coincidences and fortuitous chances occurred," the Incarnation did not elaborate.

The Incarnation had originally been only the second Stone Puppet, having not consumed many minerals and lacking great fighting power; Yang Kai had kept it hidden, but this time its devouring and refining of the entire Floating Continent led to a leap in strength.

Such a thing could never happen a second time.

"So, Grand Elder, do you still wish to learn?" the Incarnation asked.

The Ghost Ancestor pondered; cultivating an Incarnation would consume vast time and energy, and the more powerful the secret art the harder it was to cultivate.

Would it be worth delaying his pursuit of the Martial Dao for this?

"Forget it, not for now. If I wish to learn in the future, I will come to you," the Ghost Ancestor said after long thought; he decided he would wait until he had reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm before studying Incarnation.

“Very well,” the Incarnation nodded. “Mm, the main body is about to wake up. Continue with him.”
