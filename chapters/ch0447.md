## Chapter 447 — Stealing People

Yang Kai had no Blood Servants accompanying him, yet anyone present who had reached the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm could still clearly feel as if a pair of eyes were watching their every move from the shadows.

Ying Jiu!

This elusive and powerful Blood Servant must be lurking nearby, ready to strike without mercy should anyone dare to harm Yang Kai.

The Blood Servants following several young masters immediately reported this discovery.

"They're all here," Yang Kang said grumpily, clearly displeased. He had hoped to gain an advantage by acting first, but now everyone in War City knew members of Yao Wang Valley had appeared, attracting one enemy after another to scramble against him.

Among the crowd, a pair of bright, beautiful eyes suddenly froze as they stared intently at Yang Kai’s figure. Her heart was instantly filled with joy and excitement.

Yang Kai's gaze also met hers, his murderous intent and iciness vanishing in an instant, replaced instead by infinite gentleness. A faint smile curved his lips.

Caught in his look, Xia Ningshang became painfully shy. She clearly wanted to see how her junior brother was faring lately and whether he had changed, but she couldn’t help but divert her gaze, her cheeks flushing red as her heartbeat fluttered wildly.

Xia Ningshang’s bashfulness bloomed into a unique charm. Though she had always worn a veil and no one could see her true face, none doubted that she was an unparalleled beauty.

Her beauty was very restrained and reserved. The veil spared her from attracting too much attention or stealing the spotlight, but this very semi-obscurity made people all the more curious.

Everyone wondered what kind of peerless visage lay hidden beneath the veil.

The subtle exchange of looks between Yang Kai and her did not escape the perceptive bystanders. In an instant, several Yang Family disciples grew sullen.

Unlike them, Ninth Brother seemed to have some connection with this woman. This was a truly advantageous position.

"Junior Brother Yang!" Qin Ze, who usually carried an arrogant demeanor, now greeted Yang Kai warmly, behaving very affably. That form of address left others somewhat perplexed.

"Senior Brother Qin!" Yang Kai returned the greeting cheerfully, then looked toward two beautiful women ahead and spoke seriously, "Aunt Xiang, Aunt Lan."

The two lovely women smiled gently in return.

"Shopkeeper Meng!"

Meng Wuya nodded lightly.

Taking in the scene of Yang Kai greeting this crowd, Yang Zhao’s eyelids twitched sharply.

Only now did he realize these two lovely women were no ordinary figures. They were rumored to be the two maids who had long served Xiao Fusheng on Hidden Cloud Peak!

For decades, they had lived in seclusion on Hidden Cloud Peak, never descending the mountain, yet today they had come to War City!

Rumor had it they were ordinary people without any strength, yet none dared to disrespect them because they had devoted their best years silently caring for Xiao Fusheng. Without their attentive service, perhaps there would be no Master Xiao Fusheng today!

In Xiao Fusheng’s eyes, they must be crucial figures!

Why would such people come to War City? Was this Xiao Fusheng’s will? Why would he do this?

Yang Zhao shuddered at the thought. Glancing again at Yang Kai, his eyes were filled with dread.

Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying likewise sensed the subtle shift in the atmosphere. The group from Yao Wang Valley being so close to Yang Kai clearly meant they sought to enlist his support. Had this been another faction, they could have used force to block or expel them from War City, but not Yao Wang Valley. They dared not act rashly, and all looked to Yang Zhao for advice.

Yang Zhao also saw the situation clearly, but even if these people were from Yao Wang Valley, they had to be confronted this time or things would only become more troublesome later.

Drawing in a deep breath of Primordial Qi, Yang Zhao declared loudly, “Senior Qin, Yao Wang Valley has never involved itself in the succession war. Why have you come to break this balance now? We ask you to give our juniors an explanation!”

Qin Ze wore a trace of impatience and said coldly, “Second Young Master, as I have said, those from my valley have come solely to learn the alchemy arts, not to participate in any succession war. Your struggles have nothing to do with Yao Wang Valley.”

Yang Zhao smiled faintly, composed, “Since your purpose is alchemy, then I invite you to our manor to practice. We can supply all materials, and even offer the Seven-Colored Ghost Infant Flower we mentioned earlier.”

Qin Ze frowned, dissatisfied. “Is there any alchemist of high caliber in your manor who can be a teacher for the disciples of Yao Wang Valley?”

“There is none in my manor, but perhaps there is in Ninth Brother’s?” Yang Zhao’s tone grew stronger, clearly realizing that words alone wouldn’t persuade these self-important alchemists. Since softness failed, he would have to try force.

As he spoke, Yang Zhao gave a meaningful look to the other Yang Family disciples, who nodded in understanding and made quiet preparations.

“Indeed!” Qin Ze responded unexpectedly at once.

Yang Zhao sighed bitterly and shook his head. He thought the excuses offered by the Yao Wang Valley party were terribly flimsy.

Ninth Brother’s manor had not recruited any alchemists in days, and even if they had, none would be worthy of apprenticeship by Yao Wang Valley’s people.

Growing colder in expression, Yang Zhao shook his head helplessly. “If you have already made your choice, I have nothing more to say. Yao Wang Valley is revered not only because it gathers the world’s finest alchemists, but because it has maintained neutrality for thousands of years. Since you seek to break that long-standing tradition, forgive us if we show no respect!”

Qin Ze barked, “Do you intend to engage in combat then?”

“An act of helplessness, I ask for your understanding! But rest assured, my brothers and I will be careful not to harm any of your disciples.” Yang Zhao’s attitude was calm and all-encompassing, speaking both well and ill. In this way he claimed the moral high ground, so if word got out, people would not blame him.

Behind Yang Zhao, a group of experts stepped forward in unison.

At the same moment, Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying also exchanged grim looks, issuing orders. Unlike Yang Zhao’s decisiveness, they were less willing to offend Yao Wang Valley. But given the circumstances, they had no choice but to join him in pressuring Qin Ze’s group quietly, hoping they would not be stubborn and that all could retreat a step toward peace.

The atmosphere suddenly turned tense to a knife’s edge.

The onlookers gaped in shock at the audacity of the Yang Family disciples.

Although Yao Wang Valley had been severely damaged by an attack from Cangyun Evil Land last time, even its Dan Sheng’s portrait was destroyed, it still bore incomparable weight.

No one had ever dared insult Yao Wang Valley before, yet today someone had broken that precedent!

“Do you think I don't exist?” Yang Kai, who had been observing coolly, finally sneered, glaring around with murderous intent. “Anyone wanting to move against me had better ask first!”

Yang Zhao shook his head lightly. “Ninth Brother, I admit you are not weak now, but you bringing only this small group and expecting to protect your people against all of us working together—do you not think that's unrealistic? Don’t lose your men and get knocked out early.”

Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying cast ugly looks at Yang Kai, eager to strike him.

They feared Yao Wang Valley, but despised Yang Kai and wished him gone immediately.

“Second Brother, by all means, try it out!” Yang Kai answered calmly.

Yang Zhao’s face darkened as his eyes swept over Yang Kai’s reinforcements.

There were only two groups: one from the Huo Family, including two powerful Divine Roaming Realm Fifth Stage warriors, comparable even to Seventh or Eighth Stage Masters, and one from the Dong Family, with two Seventh Stage Divine Roaming practitioners. Beyond that were a few Divine Roaming Realm disciples of lesser strength and a group of True Essence Realm individuals.

Ying Jiu remained hidden in the shadows, nowhere to be found.

Though not weak, this group was clearly at a disadvantage against the combined forces arrayed before them. So why was Ninth Brother still so calm?

The events of that previous night made Yang Zhao realize Yang Kai was not as easy to confront as imagined. This Ninth Brother was cunning, skilled at hiding his talents, and had a unique style of action.

He would not bring men to their deaths without preparation!

What of the other reinforcements? According to his intelligence, eleven groups more should have gathered under Yang Kai’s banner in recent days. There were only two groups here. Where were the other nine?

At that thought, Yang Zhao’s expression shifted sharply. Looking at Yang Kai again, he saw cunning within his smile.

Without hesitation, Yang Zhao shouted, “Fifth, Sixth, Seventh Brothers, let us join forces and teach Ninth Brother how to respect his elders today!”

“Just say the word, Second Brother!” the three chorused.

In an instant, the radiance of martial skills and secret treasures erupted, spreading swiftly over Yang Kai’s forces.

Facing the combined might from all sides, the Dong and Huo families quickly fell into a harsh predicament.

All Divine Roaming Realm experts summoned their defensive treasures and exerted every effort but still failed to block all attacks.

Huo Xingchen, Dong Qinghan, and Yang Kai each deployed techniques, seeking safe spaces amid the chaotically erupting energy storm.

Seeing Yang Kai’s group overwhelmed, Yang Kang and the others could hardly conceal their delight, imagining the moment of Yang Kai’s defeat.

Yang Zhao knew better. With Ying Jiu lurking nearby, capturing Yang Kai was nearly impossible unless two or three Blood Servants from each young master’s side intervened—but that would expose them to danger too.

“Steal them!” Yang Zhao bellowed furiously, eyes locking onto the alchemists of Yao Wang Valley while Yang Kai’s people scrambled in confusion.
