## Chapter 446 — We Are Just Here to Learn the Way of Alchemy

However, those born in Yao Wang Valley were all like this—each one carried an arrogance as extreme as the desert sun, their eyes dismissive of all. The four young masters paid no heed to this; instead, they each wore a gentle smile and referred to themselves modestly as juniors.

"Senior Brother Qin!" Dong Qingyan said with a vexed expression. "I told you that you should disguise yourselves before entering the city, but you refused to listen. Now look, we’re surrounded and treated like circus monkeys. What are we to do?"

"Never mind," Qin Ze waved dismissively, completely unconcerned. "The disciples of Yao Wang Valley—no one dares to attack us. I will just send them off."

Having spoken, Qin Ze coldly scanned the enclosures, his voice sharp and commanding: "Four young masters, surrounding us here—is it your intention to start a war with Yao Wang Valley?"

The accusation was blunt, and every Yang Family disciple present gasped in alarm, hastily waving their hands in denial, saying, "No, no, Senior Qin, you misunderstand."

Qin Ze snorted coldly. "Previously, the Cangyun Evil Land launched a massive assault on Yao Wang Valley, burning all its peaks, killing countless valley disciples. And now, your Yang Family disciples do not even take us seriously? Fine. The Yang Family truly is the first in Zhongdu—bold and reckless."

The four young masters retreated their necks nervously, offering no response.

"Don’t say it’s just you four juniors. Even Yang Yinghao himself would not dare show the slightest disrespect to me," Qin Ze declared with an unyielding tone, hostile and relentless.

Though irritated, Yang Kang and the others dared not let their displeasure show. They forced polite smiles and profuse apologies.

Though they had by force blocked the Yao Wang Valley group, the four Yang family disciples aimed only to pull them into their own ranks to serve under them in alchemy; no offense was intended.

Therefore, every attitude they displayed was increasingly respectful. Qin Ze’s cold mockery was met with guarded silence.

They neither retorted nor yielded but stood smilingly firm, clearly unwilling to let them leave.

After Qin Ze vented his anger, Yang Zhao smiled slightly and said respectfully, "Senior Qin, you are a guest from afar. If you are not in a hurry, why not come to my manor for a visit?"

Upon hearing this, Yang Zhao, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying hastened to extend their own sincere invitations with utmost humility, hoping Qin Ze and his group would rest and have tea at their residences.

Qin Ze snorted coldly. "No need. No service without due reward. Step aside, we must continue on our journey."

Yang Zhao and the others were rooted to the spot, expressions conflicted. The people of Yao Wang Valley were even more difficult to deal with than peak Divine Roaming Realm experts. They couldn’t fight them, and mere words would fail to convince.

Beyond that, Yang Zhao was deeply concerned about why this group had appeared at War City. Yao Wang Valley never previously took part in the succession war. Now, with over thirty of their people suddenly present, the implications were profound.

If only there were some way to pique their interest. Then they might come willingly without invitation.

But what could that be?

After a moment’s thought, Yang Zhao brightened and loudly declared, "Senior Qin, I have a matter I wish to ask about. Is it convenient for you?"

Qin Ze’s resentment showed clearly on his face, and his tone was sour. "I am trapped here, unable to leave or advance. You tell me if it's convenient or not."

Understanding his displeasure, Yang Zhao softened his approach and said, "Some years ago, while training outside, I once accidentally stumbled into the depths of the mountains. At night while resting, I heard an infant’s cries. Curious, I sought out the source and discovered a very peculiar Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Herb—a flower with a baby’s face that radiated seven-colored light..."

Qin Ze’s expression, once dark with annoyance, now lit up. He looked at Yang Zhao eagerly, as if no longer caring about his irritation.

"And then?" Qin Ze asked hurriedly, eager to hear how the story concluded.

Seeing Qin Ze’s interest sparked by the topic of spirit herbs, the other Yang Family disciples secretly lamented that their second brother’s quick wit was paying off. They knew it was useless to be forceful with the Yao Wang Valley people; speaking of spirit herbs was exactly their weakness. Each of them racked their brains, recalling if they had come across any extraordinary treasures in recent years.

"The flower developed consciousness. I reached to pluck it, but it fled."

"Fool!" Qin Ze cursed.

Yang Zhao was unmoved and smiled. "Yes, I was ignorant and didn’t think it through then—allowing it to escape."

"What happened in the end? Did you manage to obtain the herb?"

Yang Zhao smiled and nodded. "Luckily, I was fast enough to catch up and harvest it fully. Returning to the sect afterwards, I made many inquiries and learned it to be a Mystery-Grade Upper-Level Seven-Colored Ghost Infant Flower. Per the advice of an alchemist, I confined it with a formation and nurtured it in sand and stone. It seemed fine at first, but recently it began showing signs of withering. I don’t know what went wrong."

"Slow-witted, utterly slow-witted!" Qin Ze roared with rage, as if someone had insulted his beloved wife. "Who told you to nourish the Seven-Colored Ghost Infant Flower in sand and stone?"

"Please, Senior, instruct me," Yang Zhao humbly asked.

Calming down, Qin Ze then revealed invaluable knowledge: "The Seven-Colored Ghost Infant Flower naturally emits the wails of a baby. If a martial artist listens long-term, it helps advance their Divine Sense. And this herb can be refined into a Mystery-Grade pill that nourishes Divine Sense."

"This is true. But since it is such a rare herb, aside from Master Xiao, few dare to refine it. So, I have kept it as it is," Yang Zhao responded seriously.

"Who says only Master Xiao can refine it?" Qin Ze sneered, though he said no more. "However, this herb is naturally fond of cold. Nourishing it in sand and stone and supplying energy is fine briefly, but over time the medicinal power fades and it withers. Your Yang Family has abundant resources—get some spirit qi-rich ice crystals. The alchemist who advised you is simply a fool, an insult to our craft."

"I see. I’ve been taught well," Yang Zhao exclaimed in realization.

Qin Ze nodded arrogantly. "Better late than never. If you wait another six months, that herb will be worthless."

"Yes, yes, Senior Qin is right. I will follow your advice immediately upon returning." He brightened and added, "But I’m clumsy in my work. If you are willing…"

Qin Ze laughed coldly. "I won’t go. No matter how eloquent you are, I won’t."

Yang Zhao was shocked; this refusal was so straightforward. Normally, alchemists like Qin Ze would be dazzled by Mystery-Grade Upper-Level refining materials, eager to see them.

Why was this different this time?

Seeing Qin Ze’s refusal, the other Yang Family disciples were inwardly pleased but soon frowned. Qin Ze’s firmness left them truly perplexed.

Just then, another group approached.

The four brothers’ eyes narrowed as the newcomer was none other than Yang Wei.

Since the start of the succession war, Yang Wei had remained inactive. Yet today, the appearance of Yao Wang Valley’s people at War City had stirred him.

All brothers inwardly feared Yang Wei, cautious yet allowing him to stride forward.

"Yang Wei pays respects to the seniors," Yang Wei greeted Qin Ze coldly.

"Hmm," Qin Ze nodded, indifferent.

"I have a matter to request, hoping you will consent."

Qin Ze frowned, carefully appraising him before saying, "As long as it doesn’t involve me refining pills for you, speak your request."

Yang Wei nodded. "I wish to ask you and your peers to refine pills for me."

At this, all were silently filled with awe. The reason they blocked Yao Wang Valley’s people was precisely to get this favor. But none dared voice it openly until Yang Wei bluntly declared it.

For a moment, tension grew as everyone awaited Qin Ze’s response.

If Qin Ze agreed outright, these four would be resigned even to death.

Unexpectedly, Qin Ze did not grow angry. Instead, he smiled softly and said to Yang Wei, "Eldest Brother of the Yang Family, hmm, I like that spirit. But this time, I didn’t come to War City to help you."

Yang Wei showed no surprise or disappointment. He simply nodded and cupped his fist. "I have troubled you, senior."

Without another word, he turned and strode away decisively, without hesitation.

Yang Zhao, however, heard unusual meaning behind Qin Ze’s words and hesitated. "Senior Qin, who are you here in War City to help?"

"Nobody. We are just here to learn the way of alchemy," Qin Ze snorted coldly and refused to explain further.

Yang Zhao was stunned. Learn the way of alchemy?

Who would Yao Wang Valley need to learn from? Especially when said by Qin Ze, one of the world's few Mystery-Grade alchemists.

It was an utterly unconvincing excuse.

The thought weighed heavily on Yang Zhao’s face.

Five Yang Family disciples had already appeared in the succession war but none swayed Qin Ze. Two remained.

Yang Quan was surely not one.

Could it be...

The grim thought passed when, from afar, a cold snort echoed and a large group suddenly appeared, wrapped in a brilliant light.

Yang Kai led the charge, moving like he belonged nowhere else but here. He strode directly toward Yao Wang Valley’s group, followed by Huo Xingchen, who smiled lightly, waving a folded fan as he greeted the Yang Family disciples one by one as if they were intimate friends.
