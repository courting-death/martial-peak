## Chapter 824 — With People Under You, Things Get Done

At Zhang Ao’s shout, everyone nodded in unison. True Yuan gathered, killing moves surged; they readied themselves to strike alongside him and subdue Yang Kai.

But before they could act, sharp, hurried screams suddenly rose from not far away. The cries reached their ears and made every face change at once.

Divine Senses flared out. Two or three breaths later, the experts surrounding Yang Kai all wore dark looks.

None of them were weak. As their Divine Senses swept out, they were appalled to discover wave after wave of unbridled, violent auras surging in from beyond the Nine Peaks. In a heartbeat, the whole of Nine Peaks was on edge.

At the edge of the sky, a tide of energy rolled like a black cloud, racing toward them. Within that black cloud, vague figures stood proudly in the air, watching coldly from above. A sense of oppression descended like a mountain.

Zhang Ao’s face changed drastically. He no longer had time to make a move on Yang Kai and barked, “What’s happening?”

Screams rose one after another; the stench of blood soared to the heavens. No one had a moment to answer him. Only after a while did a disciple of Poxuan Palace, drenched in blood, rush over to report, “Palace Master, this is bad—there are hordes of Demonic Beasts!”

“Demonic Beasts?” Zhang Ao’s eyelids twitched. He looked that way and just happened to see a green‑eyed giant python swallowing a cultivator whole—a horrifying sight.

Who knew which force that cultivator belonged to. His strength wasn’t low—peak Divine Roaming Realm—but before that massive python he had no power to fight back. A boundless suction seemed to pour from its ferocious maw as it drew him in and gulped him down whole. Before their eyes, a bulge pushed down the python’s thick neck.

Sss, sss, sss…

Blows struck the python again and again, throwing off showers of sparks. Its body was covered in black scales, solid as a fortress; it seemed barely hurt. With a lash of head and tail, several more cultivators were swallowed, several were swatted flying and burst into blood‑mist on the spot.

And this was only one scene from that bloody purgatory.

Looking across the Nine Peaks, all manner of ferocious Demonic Beasts of every size and shape rampaged among the crowd, each with blood‑red eyes and their bloodiest instincts roused. They ran wild, committing appalling slaughter that no one could stop.

Screams rose and fell without cease, mixed with sheer panic and confusion.

“Where did these Demonic Beasts come from?” Zhang Ao’s face went pale. While he watched that black cloud in dread, he shouted the question.

“They seem to be coming from the direction of the Beast Sea Great Forest!” Cao Guan answered quickly.

At those words, every expert around Yang Kai felt as if dumped into an ice cellar; they shivered all over.

Beast Sea Great Forest was a territory of the yao. A Great Yao Lord ruled there—one of the top experts under heaven!

Looking again at the black cloud swiftly approaching, everyone understood in an instant what was happening.

“Damn brat—colluding with fiends of the yao!” Zhang Ao’s eyes spat fire as he turned to look at Yang Kai—only to freeze. The Yang Kai who should have been surrounded in their midst was gone, leaving only dozens of experts gathered there.

The black cloud finally descended over the Nine Peaks. From the rolling waves of cloud, a seven‑colored radiance flared. Shrouded in that iridescent glow, a graceful figure with wings drifted down from above, her delicate, beautiful face cold as ice.

Caidie!

Close beside Caidie, twenty or thirty Yao experts who had already taken human form spread out with vicious grins and surging momentum. Kuang Shi was first onto the field—he slammed into the ground like a cannonball, gouging out a huge pit, then shot like thunder to a Transcendent Realm cultivator. He ignored the man’s blows on his rock‑hard body, grabbed him, and bit into his neck.

Blood spurted. Kuang Shi was like a lunatic, joy blazing in his eyes. The Transcendent cultivator didn’t even form the thought of resistance before Kuang Shi bit through his throat and killed him.

The bloody scene seared into the nearby cultivators’ eyes and shattered their nerves. They scattered in panic, not daring to face Kuang Shi.

Before they could reach safety, several Demonic Beasts burst in from the flank and cut off their retreat.

On one of the Nine Peaks, atop its summit, Yang Kai stood and watched the bloody purgatory below with a cold gaze.

With a flicker of shadow, the Great Yao Lord appeared at his side.

“Great Lord, you’re late,” Yang Kai greeted with a smile.

“Hmph. Gathering manpower takes work. You didn’t give me much time to prepare,” the Great Yao Lord snorted.

“How many came?”

“Three thousand. Above Sixth‑Tier! Eighty at Seventh‑Tier and above; nine at Eighth‑Tier and above.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help raising a brow. “Quite a lineup.”

“Otherwise, how do you think I keep the peace in the Beast Sea Great Forest alone? Your humans would have wiped us out long ago.” The Great Lord slowly shook his head. “It’s the same with your Nine Heavens Sacred Land—you relied too much on your Saint Lord. Once the old Saint Lord died, this place became paper‑thin.”

“That’s them, not me,” Yang Kai said with a chuckle. He had seen Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s weakness as well. Unlike the yao, who had many experts besides their top Great Lord, so that even if the Great Lord died one day, the Beast Sea Great Forest wouldn’t be easy to invade.

This time, the yao had likely emptied their nest.

“Remember what you promised me,” the Great Yao Lord said with a sidelong glance at Yang Kai.

“Relax. We agreed—I’m not about to go back on my word,” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

“How do you want me to handle these intruders?” the Great Yao Lord asked again.

“Use your judgment,” Yang Kai said with a shrug, as if it had nothing to do with him.

The Great Lord let out a derisive laugh. “You sly brat—you’d love for me to kill them all, wouldn’t you?”

Yang Kai gave a dry laugh and didn’t answer—tacit admission.

“But you’ll be disappointed. Killing too many does my yao no good. It’ll only invite even crazier human retaliation,” the Great Lord snorted. He’d long since seen that Yang Kai wanted to borrow the Yao’s strength to solve his crisis.

If these people died, the hatred would fall on the yao, and Nine Heavens Sacred Land could stay out of it.

Though he saw through it, the Great Yao Lord still couldn’t refuse Yang Kai’s proposal—but as for how to carry it out, he wouldn’t necessarily follow Yang Kai’s wishes.

“There’s something I don’t quite understand. Mind answering, boy?” the Great Yao Lord asked, slanting a look at Yang Kai.

“What is it?”

“Where did all the people of your Nine Heavens Sacred Land go? It looks like you’re the only one here.”

“Naturally, they’re hidden somewhere safe. No need to worry, Great Lord. When this is over, the alchemists and artifact refiners I promised you will return on time.”

“All the better. I didn’t think you’d dare deceive me.”

Below, seeing the yao surging in with countless experts, Zhang Ao and the others knew the situation was hopeless. One after another, they wrapped themselves in True Yuan and tried to break out.

Bitter as it was, there was nothing else to be done.

The Duao Alliance’s leader, Yun Cheng, stood dumbstruck as he watched his disciples die in droves. In that moment, he felt heartfelt regret.

If only he had listened to his daughter earlier and withdrawn with everyone at once, they wouldn’t have been dragged into this storm—and no one would have been hurt.

Now it was too late to pull back. Of the several hundred disciples he’d brought, nearly half were already dead or wounded, and he himself was fleeing in disgrace under the fierce assault of yao experts.

Seeing Zhang Ao and the others retreating, Yun Cheng didn’t dare linger. He rallied those disciples still alive and followed close behind Zhang Ao to carve out a bloody path.

From the yao’s arrival to now, scarcely a stick of incense had burned before the battle gradually died down.

Within the Nine Peaks, the ground was strewn with corpses and blood. The sight was shocking. Of the cultivators gathered here, close to a thousand had died.

Massive Demonic Beasts thundered like rolling drums, galloping across the hellish ground in wild pursuit.

“Don’t chase them!” a crisp, feminine shout rang out. Caidie’s graceful figure fluttered down. The Demonic Beasts that had chased beyond the Nine Peaks halted as if spellbound and howled at the sky.

Their howls carried far, making the half‑dead cultivators even more panic‑stricken as they ran with every ounce of strength.

“When you’ve got people under you, everything’s easier,” Yang Kai sighed. The massive crisis facing Nine Heavens Sacred Land had been resolved with such ease by the yao. The contrast was disheartening.

“This strength was accumulated by my yao over hundreds and thousands of years. Did you think such power could be had at a whim?” The Great Lord sneered. “Still, your Nine Heavens Sacred Land isn’t bad—though you’re a ways off from us.”

“We’re definitely a ways off—otherwise I wouldn’t have borrowed your strength,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Cultivate well. In less than a hundred years, you’ll stand where I do. Then your Nine Heavens Sacred Land will be strong once more.”

“A hundred years? Great Lord, you look down on people too much,” Yang Kai said with a curl of his lip.

“Don’t tell me ‘twenty or thirty years’—I won’t believe such nonsense.”

“Just you wait,” Yang Kai rolled his eyes.

As they spoke, Caidie flew up to them and landed lightly. After a faint glance at Yang Kai, she reported, “Great Lord, the humans have all fled.”

“Mm. Pass the order—clean up the battlefield, then let everyone do as they please. From today on, the Nine Peaks is our yao’s territory. Make good use of the resources here.”

“Yes.”

“Boy, I’ve solved your problem. Time you fulfilled your promise.”

Yang Kai nodded.

Having struck a bargain with the Great Lord, he had no intention of going back on it.

He went to the Sacred Tomb and released the alchemists and artifact refiners he had arranged in advance, handing them over to the Great Lord—who was delighted.

Though the Sacred Land’s alchemists and artifact refiners were somewhat frightened by the yao, once the Great Lord guaranteed their personal safety, they calmed down.

Yang Kai also activated the grand array of the Nine Peaks for the yao, making the Spiritual Qi here dense once more.

As for the spirit formation diagrams they had discussed beforehand, Yang Kai had already found fine jade and carved marks into it with his Divine Sense before giving it to the Great Lord for his own comprehension.

These spirit formation diagrams concerned the yao’s Huasheng Pool—and they were what the Great Yao Lord valued most.
