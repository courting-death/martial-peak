## Chapter 606 — I Will Go to That World

After a moment, the figure of the Golden Feather Eagle appeared. Yang Kai reached out and called; the Golden Feather Eagle cheerfully alighted on his shoulder, using its beak to preen Yang Kai’s hair with extreme affection.

“Your nose is still the most sensitive!” Yang Kai patted its head.

He had never expected that upon returning to Zhongdu, the first to come meet him would be this little eagle.

Following the eagle came a graceful figure.

Qiu Yimeng pushed her speed to the limit and arrived at Yang Kai’s side almost simultaneously with the eagle.

“Long time no see!” Yang Kai greeted her with a broad smile.

Qiu Yimeng’s expression was a tumult of excitement, joy, fear and worry; she stopped ten zhang away from Yang Kai, crystal tears shining in her beautiful eyes as she stared at him, looking foolishly at ease.

She hesitated to come closer, as if afraid it might be an illusion that would shatter the moment she approached.

“What’s the matter?” Yang Kai smiled.

Qiu Yimeng drew a deep breath and then suddenly stepped forward; when she reached him, a fierce look flashed across her pretty face, she grabbed Yang Kai’s arm and bit down hard.

Tilting her head up to look at Yang Kai, tears flickering in her beautiful eyes, she wore an expression of deep grievance; gradually her bite loosened and she began to sniffle and sob.

Yang Kai sighed, “Starting off with such a tragic and solemn tone — I didn’t bully you.”

“I… I thought… I thought you were really dead… dead… Where have you been these past six months?” Qiu Yimeng could no longer contain herself and burst into loud weeping, pouring out the worries she had held these past six months; her delicate body slowly sank down, her fragrant shoulders trembling, looking pitiably bereft of support.

Yang Kai’s feelings became complicated. After she had vented for a while, he reached out and helped her to her feet.

Qiu Yimeng wiped her eyes with small hands, choking on sobs, cheeks faintly flushed, looking somewhat embarrassed.

“This is the first time I’ve seen you cry.” Yang Kai laughed aloud, “You’re nothing like your usual self — it’s quite entertaining.”

“Pervert!” Qiu Yimeng glared at Yang Kai, tears turning to a smile.

She drew a deep breath to steady herself and returned to her usual composed manner, but seeing Yang Kai’s teasing grin again, she couldn’t help but become angry; she gave him a kick with her foot, snorted, and turned to walk toward Zhongdu.

Still, a trace of a happy smile lingered at the corner of her mouth.

Yang Kai scratched his head, thinking that even the most outstanding and clever women can be fragile at certain moments.

It seemed the Golden Feather Eagle’s movements had alerted those busy in Zhongdu; before Yang Kai even returned to Zhongdu, a large group of people were already racing over from that direction.

From afar, Huo Xingchen bawled with tears and snot, “Young Master Kai, Young Master Kai, you really aren’t dead! I always said that good people don’t live long; disasters last for a thousand years!”

Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Behind Huo Xingchen came the Dong siblings, the four girls of Wan Hua Palace, Luo Xiaoman of Ziwei Valley, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu of Yingyue Sect, Zuo Fang of Wen Xin Palace, Chu Jingshan of Fei Yu Pavilion, the Hu sisters of the Blood Battle Gang, Fang Ziqi of Fengyu Tower, Tao Yang of Baoqi Sect…

Nearly all the rising young leaders of the manor were present; each of them wore an excited expression and smiled warmly in welcome.

They quickly flew to Yang Kai’s side. Huo Xingchen didn’t bother to be formal and gave Yang Kai a bear hug, overcome with excitement.

“Young Master Kai, you’ve finally returned — we missed you terribly.” Huo Xingchen exhaled heavily, speaking from the heart.

Yang Kai was moved. He pushed Huo Xingchen aside and, adopting a serious expression, nodded, “I missed you all too. Come now, everyone, let me hug you — let me see if you’ve grown while I was gone.”

“Shameless!” Han Xiao Qi of Wan Hua Palace flushed and spat in annoyance.

Laughter rose around him. Yang Kai gave Luo Xiaoman a leering glance and nodded in a lecherous way, “Mm, Xiaoman has grown — the chest has gotten bigger.”

“No it hasn’t…” Luo Xiaoman’s face reddened; she felt deeply aggrieved.

“Enough with the lechery, we’ll sort this out when we go back.” Qiu Yimeng glared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai, who had been missing for half a year, suddenly returned to Zhongdu; the thirteen Blood Servants of the manor, other young family heads and elders of the Eight Great Families all stirred and hastened to the Yang Family to meet him.

In the Yang Family main hall, Fourth Master Yang and his wife wept openly; Dong Suzhu tightly gripped Yang Kai’s hand, unwilling to let go as if afraid he might vanish again.

The hall was densely packed with people — the Eight Great Families and hundreds from Yang Kai’s household had gathered.

Everyone stared at Yang Kai with curiosity, wanting to know where he had gone these past six months and why he had not appeared; they most wanted to know what had happened underground in Zhongdu half a year ago.

Why had so many people gone missing, and why, until now, had only Yang Kai appeared?

Countless questions tangled in everyone’s minds; confusion and unease filled the crowd.

“Ninth Brother.” Yang Zhao suddenly stood, “Now that you have safely returned, the position of head of the Yang Family—”

Yang Kai raised a hand to cut him off, smiling, “Second Brother, my ambitions lie elsewhere; the position of head of the Yang Family is better suited to you.”

Yang Zhao shook his head slowly, “I was utterly defeated in the Succession War; how could I possibly have the right to be the head of the Yang Family?”

Yang Kai said, “Second Brother, you are being modest. Your methods and abilities are apparent to all; the Succession War does not prove everything.”

“But—”

“Let me finish.”

Yang Zhao nodded slightly.

“In a while I will be leaving here, so I cannot stay to be head of the Yang Family.” Yang Kai said slowly.

Dong Suzhu’s delicate body trembled; she gripped Yang Kai’s hand tighter and asked softly, “Where are you going?”

Yang Kai pointed upward with his hand, “To a higher world.”

Everyone in the hall looked baffled.

“Put simply, the world we know is not the only world. There are places we have never heard of. Just as we once did not know there was a realm above the Divine Roaming Realm — that realm is called the Transcendent Realm!”

Many faces immediately showed interest.

“The Evil Lord Yang Bai led the Cangyun Evil Land to launch a major invasion of Zhongdu; his goal, like mine, was to reach that higher world.”

“What does that have to do with invading Zhongdu?” Dong Qinghan asked, puzzled.

“Underneath Zhongdu there is an Earth Vein, and within that vein there is a gate. Passing through that gate leads to the higher-tier world. His true aim was that gate.” Yang Kai inhaled lightly. “Half a year ago he slaughtered and used Blood Sacrifice to pierce the underground Earth Vein and sought that gate. The eight Family Heads went to stop him; Di Mo and I pursued as well, Shopkeeper Meng and his disciple, and my Senior Sister Su were also in the depths. After a fierce battle, Shopkeeper Meng slew Yang Bai, but before dying Yang Bai attempted to destroy that gate in order to trigger a catastrophe and take us all with him.”

Everyone held their breath, listening intently.

What Yang Kai was saying precisely answered the long-standing mystery in their minds — what had happened underground half a year ago.

“The gate was destroyed, and at the crucial moment Shopkeeper Meng led his disciple and my Senior Sister through that gate; they safely reached that higher-tier world.”

Meng Wuya sent some information at the last moment before the Void Passage collapsed; it was through that information that Yang Kai learned they had safely passed through the Void Passage.

“But I entered too late. I was ultimately carried off by the burst force of the void and transported Overseas, where I remained for half a year.”

Everyone immediately understood and at last realized what had baffled them.

The battle beneath the city six months ago had been far more dangerous and bizarre than they had imagined.

“What became of those eight Family Heads?” someone asked anxiously.

“They most likely perished.” Yang Kai’s expression dimmed. “Their movements were slower than mine; while I was carried away by the shattered void’s force, they were struck by the erupting Earth Vein energy and likely did not survive, buried in the depths. It is a grave loss for the Eight Great Families.”

Many faces immediately fell and sorrow spread through the hall.

“As long as you survived, that is enough.” Ling Taixu nodded lightly. “We all thought you and the others were dead; learning that some are alive makes this less terrible.”

Meng Wuya was safe and sound, and Ling Taixu was genuinely happy for him.

Silence settled over the hall for a long moment before Qiu Yimeng asked, “Yang Kai, you say you want to go to that world. Do you know what that place is like?”

“I know a little, not very clearly.” Yang Kai shook his head, smiling faintly as his gaze dropped to a remote corner of the hall. With significance he said, “Although I am unclear, someone here is—Shui Ling, what do you say?”

In that remote corner, a woman with pale blue hair who stood out from the crowd, Shui Ling, leaned against the wall idly cracking nuts. When Yang Kai’s gaze turned to her, Shui Ling sneered slightly.

“If I’m not mistaken, you should be from that world, right? Like Shopkeeper Meng and Di Mo.”

In an instant everyone’s eyes turned toward Shui Ling.

“What has that to do with me? Why are you all staring?” Shui Ling was displeased; she had been regretting that during the battle half a year ago she had not followed Meng Wuya — if she had, she would have returned safely and would not still be here.

“I want to know what that world is like.” Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

“What is it like?” Shui Ling frowned. “If you want me to explain, I can’t be very precise.” After a pause she offered, “To put it another way, don’t you have superb families here and first-, second-, and third-ranked Sects?”

Yang Kai nodded and motioned for her to continue.

“Compare the forces here with those over there, and the Zhongdu Eight Great Families would at best count as a second-rate power.”

Every face changed color instantly.

Yang Kai pondered, “Then how about your Water Divine Hall?”

“It can barely be considered a first-rate power.”

Yang Kai drew a soft breath, realizing he had underestimated how complex that other world was; yet that stark contrast only deepened his yearning for the higher world.
