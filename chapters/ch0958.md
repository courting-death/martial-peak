## Chapter 958 — Doesn't It Look Like It?

The journey passed beneath Meng Wuya's curses and simmering resentment.

It was clear he still bore a grudge over Changyuan having used formations against him back then. Yang Kai smiled wryly; had he known Shopkeeper Meng cared so much about that matter, he wouldn't have asked so many questions. Now he only suffered for his curiosity—he had quite literally lifted a stone to drop on his own foot.

A few days later, the Demon Capital loomed ahead.

From afar the whole Demon Capital lay like a prostrate primeval beast, exuding an ancient desolation; even dozens of li away Yang Kai could feel waves of fierce, malevolent qi rolling from that direction.

It was the aura of the demon experts who dwelt within the Demon Capital.

Although the entire Demon Domain had only five cultivators who had reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, the Demon Capital, being a strategic seat, had no fewer than a dozen masters at Saint Realm level stationed there.

Demon Lord Changyuan was normally secluded, meditating on Heaven's Dao and martial principles and rarely meddling in the Demon Domain's affairs. Rumor held he sought to break through his current shackles and reach the heights once attained by the Great Demon God.

Unfortunately, decades—even centuries—had passed and his cultivation seemed to have made no progress, remaining stuck at its present level.

Even so, he remained the foremost expert within the Demon Domain, far more formidable than the Four Great Demon Generals.

Demon cities differed from human ones not only in architectural style—which here appeared fierce and rugged, possessing a wild kind of beauty—but also in that they had no guards posted at their gates.

Anyone could pass through the gate at will, unlike human cities where sentinels stood within and one had to pay a Crystal Stone to gain entry.

The four of them made no effort to conceal themselves; brazenly, they strode through the gate into the Demon Capital.

In an instant countless gazes shot toward Yang Kai, appraising him with keen interest.

"A human?"

"Heh heh—interesting. Someone actually dares to barge into my Demon Capital!"

"This kid's got guts; does he take us demons for nothing?"

The demon cultivators walking the city all turned toward Yang Kai with feral grins, murderous intent and ill will on their faces; many subtly closed in, intending to teach him a lesson.

Meng Wuya snorted coldly; his stern gaze swept the area. Any demon caught in that stare halted in their tracks, a chill sinking into them as if plunged into an ice cellar.

Only then did they realize the human youth who dared to enter the Demon Capital had backing.

Yang Kai smiled lightly and stopped in his tracks, no longer advancing. Hundreds of demons soon ringed them three layers deep; if they continued onward a fight would almost certainly erupt.

"Is there anyone here with authority?" Yang Kai scanned the crowd and called out in a clear voice.

The demons only stared; no one answered.

Yang Kai suddenly fixed his gaze on one spot in the crowd. A demon cultivator, his strength at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, strode over with a grim expression; his Demon Yuan surged and ebbed, and when he looked at the three standing behind Yang Kai his eyes filled with obvious apprehension.

Other demons lacked the discernment to see the threat presented by Meng Wuya, Li Rong and Han Fei, but this one was different.

Those three alone exerted tremendous pressure; he naturally knew they were not nobodies. That such top-tier experts were trailing a human youth—who on earth was this human?

"Who are you? What brings you to my Demon Capital?" The demon stopped ten zhang before Yang Kai, unwilling to approach further, and shouted from a distance.

"The Demon Lord invited me. Can you send word to him—tell him Yang Kai has arrived!"

"Yang Kai?" The demon frowned, vaguely recalling the name yet unable to place it, then barked, "Are you truly invited by the Demon Lord?"

"Do you think I'd lie to you?" Yang Kai chuckled.

"Fine, wait here a moment; I'll go to the Demon Palace to report!" the demon said, then suddenly paused as if he heard a summons. After a long moment he solemnly nodded and, face full of respect, answered, "Yes!"

Turning to Yang Kai, he clasped his fists and said, “The Demon Lord has just sent word—he ordered me to escort you to the Demon Palace immediately. No need for further approval. This way, please!”

Yang Kai nodded and, together with Meng Wuya and the others, followed his lead.

Countless demons watched curiously as they departed, wondering why the Demon Lord would summon such a human to the Demon Capital.

Before the Demon Palace lay a vast plaza.

Black stone pillars jutted up across the square, each containing subtle arcane secrets; faint streams of energy flowed within them.

Many of the pillars had prisoners bound to them—some already dead, others barely breathing and on the verge of death.

The whole plaza gave off a stench of rot; carrion crows cawed as they landed upon the corpses and pecked at the flesh.

As the demon guide led them past, Yang Kai couldn't help but stare and furrow his brow.

The guide seemed to notice his puzzlement and offered an explanation: "These are sinners who defied the Demon Lord. They must endure ninety days of the Extreme Rending Punishment here before being allowed to die!"

"Ninety days? The Demon Lord's methods are excessively cruel—killing would be a quicker mercy," Yang Kai said with displeasure.

The guide sneered. "The Demon Lord has already spared them some mercy. If it were me, I'd extract their souls and torment them for eternity!"

Yang Kai shot him a glance and inwardly shook his head.

Though he knew the demon folk were ferocious, this method was still excessively brutal.

"Not all bound here are demons," Yang Kai remarked, looking at one pillar where the corpse bore no trace of Demon Yuan—clearly a human.

"Oh, those are the rare few—your so‑called human experts who dared to invade our Demon Domain; naturally they must pay the price!" the guide said with a grim chuckle.

Yang Kai nodded; there were always some who, bloated with false confidence, came to stir up trouble in the Demon Domain only to misjudge their limits and suffer the consequences.

For such people Yang Kai felt no sympathy whatsoever.

"Yang Kai!" Meng Wuya suddenly stopped and looked gravely at one of the pillars.

"What is it?"

"Look at that one!" Meng Wuya pointed.

Yang Kai followed the gesture and saw a disheveled demon bound to the pillar; his aura was faint, like a candle about to be snuffed by the wind.

He hung his head, his tangled long hair hiding his face so that his features could not be seen.

His hands and feet were each pierced through by long black spikes that pinned him to the stone pillar, rendering him immobile.

The blood that flowed from those wounds had long since dried, making the sight especially woeful.

Li Rong and Han Fei both frowned, relieved inwardly that the masters they served were not as savage as Demon Lord Changyuan.

The guide who had brought Yang Kai glanced at the bound demon and grinned. "That fellow's got backbone; even I admire him."

He went on to explain, "He's a rising talent in our Demon Domain. Ten years ago he was unknown, but over the past decade his strength has risen explosively. Now he stands at the peak of the First Stage of the Saint Realm; give him two years and he might reach my level. Pity... he refused to submit to the Demon Lord, so they nailed him here and told him he'd be freed when he relented. It's been months, but he still won't yield. The Demon Lord says he will eventually attain the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; in time our domain may produce a fifth Demon General!"

"Doesn't he look like him?" Meng Wuya ignored the guide's chatter and, with a solemn expression, looked toward Yang Kai.

"Not just looks like—he is!" Yang Kai's face darkened as he strode toward the pillar.

"Hey, what are you doing?" The guide sensed something amiss and hastily called out, stepping forward to block Yang Kai.

"Shut your mouth!" Meng Wuya shot him a glare, killing intent surging in his eyes. "Say one more word and I'll kill you this instant. Take one step and I'll kill you too!"

The guide opened his mouth but his face flushed crimson; he dared not utter another word or make any move.

He had seen the dense, almost tangible killing intent in Meng Wuya's eyes.

"What's wrong with Master? Does he know that demon?" Li Rong asked, puzzled.

"He knows," Meng Wuya answered gravely.

Li Rong's slim body trembled and she looked over with concern.

Yang Kai had already reached the pillar, his excitement barely contained and tinged with guilt. With trembling hands he pushed back the ragged hair to reveal the demon's ashen face.

Stirred by the movement, the demon opened his eyes. As Yang Kai's features resolved before him, the dull, lifeless gaze suddenly flared with a flash of clarity. Surprise lit his expression; his cracked lips twitched as if to speak, but no sound came.

"I know," Yang Kai nodded. "Don't speak now."

The demon gave a faint nod and obeyed.

"Hang on; I'll get you down." Yang Kai gripped the black spike driven through the demon's right hand and, with a sudden pull, tore it free, drawing up a spray of jet‑black blood.

He repeated the method and removed the remaining three spikes.

Throughout the ordeal the demon trembled in agony, but his will was iron‑hard—he did not utter a sound.

Li Rong and Han Fei watched in pained discomfort.

Yang Kai lowered the half‑dead demon to the ground, gave him some Wan Yao Ling Milk without question to aid his recovery, then hurriedly checked his condition.
