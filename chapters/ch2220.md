## Chapter 2220 — Ban Qing

As the newcomer sized up Yang Kai, Yang Kai also watched him warily!

With a sweep of Divine Sense, Yang Kai instantly saw through the other’s cultivation—Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—laid bare, with nowhere to hide. Judging by his appearance, he seemed to be a man in his early forties, with a steady, resolute face. Yet at this moment, his eyes betrayed a trace of panic and fear.

The other harbored no hostility—Yang Kai was certain.

However... this was the first time Yang Kai had encountered a martial artist within the Divine Roaming Mirror world, so he was naturally extremely curious. Upon careful observation, he found that the other’s body, just like his own Spirit Body, was condensed from soul energy, without any flesh and blood.

The world truly is full of wonders! Yang Kai marveled inwardly.

“If you don’t want to die, hurry up and run!” At that moment, the other man suddenly shouted in a low, solemn voice.

“What?” Yang Kai frowned. The other’s words were abrupt and made no sense to him at all.

But the newcomer clearly had no intention of explaining further. As he spurred his power and fled in a certain direction, he shouted again, “If you don’t run now, it’ll be too late.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately had a bad premonition. He vaguely realized that some powerful being was chasing this man, and that being was undoubtedly extremely dangerous and vicious.

With this thought, he made a decisive decision and hurried to leave this place of trouble.

After all, he had only been brought into this world by Gao Xueting to temper himself. He had no interest in meddling in the grudges and entanglements between the native forces and martial artists of this world. After all, the total time he could stay here was, at most, just one month.

As this thought passed, Yang Kai prepared to act.

But at that moment, a sudden change occurred.

A mighty pressure belonging solely to the Emperor Realm abruptly descended from the sky. The pressure was so heavy it felt almost tangible, making one feel as if the sky itself was collapsing.

Yang Kai’s body instantly shrank a notch, his face turning extremely unsightly.

At the same time, out of the corner of his eye, he suddenly caught sight of a ghostly figure appearing, materializing right beside the martial artist from before.

This figure was not tall—in fact, rather short and small—but before he appeared, Yang Kai hadn’t sensed a thing, as if he had always been there, simply unnoticed.

As this mysterious Emperor Realm expert appeared, a flash of light manifested in his hand, and a dagger-like weapon materialized.

This weapon was clearly condensed from this person’s soul power, not a Divine Soul Secret Treasure.

The dagger gleamed coldly, and before the middle-aged man could react, the newcomer had already stabbed forward.

A soft squelch sounded out, and Yang Kai felt his scalp prickle with unease.

The middle-aged man, at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, had no time to defend himself and was pierced through the chest by the other’s attack.

In the outside world, this would have been a fatal wound, for the spot struck was the heart. No matter how strong a martial artist was, if their heart was damaged like this, they would likely die instantly—unless they had cultivated some heaven-defying secret art, or could suppress the injury with their own powerful cultivation, barely clinging to life.

But in the Divine Roaming Mirror world, since living beings had no physical bodies, the wound, though severe, was not fatal.

After landing the blow, the Emperor Realm expert withdrew his hand and stood coldly, glancing at the other man with eyes devoid of emotion, as if looking at a piece of wood.

The middle-aged man, on the other hand, let out a pained cry and stood rigidly in place.

Looking over, Yang Kai saw that the dagger was still lodged in the man’s chest. From the wound, a strange energy radiated outward in arcs, forming a complex pattern, like a mysterious and powerful restriction.

It was this strange energy that restricted the man’s movements, leaving him unable to take a single step.

From his wound, wisps of soul energy leaked out. Clearly, his power was draining away. If left unchecked, all of his soul energy would eventually flow out through the wound.

When that happened, he would surely die.

“Are you the Calamity Star of this world?” The Emperor Realm expert, having succeeded in his strike, asked in a calm, indifferent tone.

“My lord... what are you saying?” Though gravely wounded by the sneak attack, the middle-aged man dared not lose his temper. He could only look at the other with pleading eyes, asking in confusion.

“Enough!” the short Emperor Realm expert replied, sounding bored. “Whether you are or not, we’ll know after taking you back to the royal palace for questioning.”

With that, he no longer paid the man any attention.

"The royal palace!" The middle-aged man, hearing this, caught something unusual in those words. Staring wide-eyed at the other, his face changed several times before he asked with difficulty, "May I ask... are you Lord Ban Qing?"

“Oh?” Ban Qing looked at the man in surprise. “You recognize me?”

Seeing that he didn’t deny it, the man gave a bitter smile and said, “Among the four Deputy Commanders under Lord Zhou Dian, the Grand General—who doesn’t know their names? Who hasn’t heard of them?”

“If there are four, why are you so sure it’s me? Couldn’t it be one of the others?” Ban Qing didn’t seem in a hurry to deal with Yang Kai, but instead chatted with his prey with interest.

The man replied, “Deputy Commander Lian Yan has a head of red hair, a distinctive feature. Deputy Commander Yu Man is a woman. As for Deputy Commander Yuan Qing... rumor has it that Deputy Commander Yuan is as beautiful as a flower, with a face like white jade—even ordinary women pale in comparison. Since you’re from the royal palace and possess such cultivation, I can’t think of anyone else but Ban Qing.”

“Hahahaha!” Ban Qing suddenly burst out laughing. “As beautiful as a flower—so that’s how the world talks about Yuan Qing. I wonder what he’d think if he heard that... Hm, your analysis is good. This Lord is indeed Ban Qing!”

Seeing him finally admit it, the man gave up all hope, his expression wilting. “Seeing is believing. Lord Ban’s skills in stealth and assassination are truly extraordinary!”

“Hmph!” Ban Qing snorted disdainfully, not caring for the flattery.

“But... Lord Ban, I have no grudge with you. Why—” Though unable to move, the man still hoped to plead for his life.

But Ban Qing clearly had no intention of giving him that chance. This time, he had entered Heavenly Yao Mountain on Zhou Dian’s orders to capture the Calamity Stars of the present world. Though he couldn’t kill without reason, injuring or crippling was no problem.

So before the man could finish, Ban Qing reached out and grasped the air from a distance.

The dagger lodged in the man’s chest suddenly burst with light, and the strange energy radiating outward instantly solidified under its influence.

The man convulsed as if struck by lightning, his body shuddering before he collapsed, completely unconscious.

Though not dead, he had fallen into a deep coma, and even if he woke, he would likely never recover his peak. Ban Qing’s strike had clearly damaged his very foundation.

After all this, the dagger whooshed back into Ban Qing’s hand. He turned and looked coldly at Yang Kai.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s mind was racing…

He hadn’t quite understood what had happened before, but after listening to the conversation between these two, he had a vague grasp of the situation.

He even had some guesses about the larger situation here.

Since these two mentioned the royal palace, it seemed that within the Divine Roaming Mirror world, there was a nation ruled by a king as the supreme authority.

Beneath the king, there appeared to be a Grand General named Zhou Dian.

And under Zhou Dian’s command were four experts at the Emperor Realm—just like Ban Qing before him!

At this moment, they had all entered Heavenly Yao Mountain to capture the so-called Calamity Stars…

The middle-aged man was either the target or just an unlucky bystander. Yang Kai guessed it was the latter, since from his words, he knew nothing about this Calamity Star business.

As for himself, he was probably in the same boat!

People like Ban Qing didn’t know who exactly they were supposed to catch, so they simply cast a wide net, grabbing anyone they came across—no one could escape.

What rotten luck! Yang Kai cursed inwardly.

It was rare to have a chance to temper himself in this world, yet he’d gotten caught up in the grudges of its martial artists—and right off the bat, it was an Emperor Realm expert… Yang Kai couldn’t help but complain.

“Not bad, boy!” Ban Qing looked at Yang Kai for a while, then suddenly smiled and nodded, his expression kindly.

“What do you mean by that?” Yang Kai asked in a deep voice.

“This Lord means… you know your limits, and realize you’re no match for me, so you didn’t try to run. Good, if you behave, I can let you suffer less.” Ban Qing spoke calmly, then suddenly changed his tone, his voice turning cold: “But if you don’t know what’s good for you, you’ll end up like him!”

As he spoke, he pointed at the man lying on the ground.

Yang Kai frowned, pondered for a moment, then said, “My lord…”

“Don’t talk to me about innocence!” Ban Qing seemed to know what Yang Kai wanted to say, cutting him off impatiently. “I’m just following orders. If you really are the Calamity Star, then you’re out of luck. If not, you’ll be fine.”

Staring at Yang Kai, he said, “Will you surrender yourself, or do I have to do it? I can’t guarantee you’ll be unharmed if it’s the latter!”

“I see…” Yang Kai, having failed to negotiate, sighed helplessly and asked with a heavy expression, “I have one more question I’d like to ask.”

“Speak!” Ban Qing replied coldly.

“From your conversation with that gentleman just now, it sounds as though there are three others like yourself. I was wondering about those three…”

“They’re searching elsewhere. Right now, Heavenly Yao Mountain is completely sealed off, so don’t even think about escaping—it’s pointless.”
