## Chapter 2427 — Not His Own Flesh and Blood

"Father, the Bloodjade Qilin Seal must not be destroyed!" Feng Xi cried out in alarm.

"Shut up!" Feng Xuan snapped, glaring at Feng Xi with a look of bitter disappointment. He suddenly realized that, compared to this young man, his own son was utterly lacking.

Had he spoiled his son too much all these years? Feng Xuan reflected inwardly.

On the other side, Yang Kai spoke up again, "Looks like Lord Feng can't actually come up with one billion Middle-Level Source Crystals after all. Just now you were boasting about how grand and wealthy Wenqing Sect is, and here I was, a country bumpkin who's never seen the world, hoping to broaden my horizons. But it seems... tsk tsk tsk. Senior Bing Yun, since they can't pay the price, go ahead and destroy it!"

Bing Yun nodded slightly and raised the longsword in her hand high.

Feng Xuan's face turned ashen as he hurriedly said, "Fine, one billion it is."

It was just one billion Middle-Level Source Crystals. He could afford it. The only reason he hadn't agreed before was because he didn't want to let Yang Kai lead him by the nose. After all, he was a Third Stage Emperor Realm master. To be manipulated by Yang Kai in front of so many people was disgraceful. But now, he had no choice but to agree.

"Straightforward! Lord Feng, you really are a decisive man. I appreciate that!" Yang Kai laughed heartily.

At these words, even the ever-calm Bing Yun broke out in a cold sweat, thinking, This brat really dares to say anything.

Feng Xuan said coldly, "I can give you these one billion Middle-Level Source Crystals, but I have one condition."

Yang Kai snorted, "Lord Feng, are you still half-asleep? Do you think you have the right to bargain with me? Hand over the Source Crystals first, then we can talk."

Feng Xuan looked at him mockingly, "Aren't you even curious what my condition is before refusing outright?"

Yang Kai scoffed, "You can't expect anything decent from a dog's mouth. I don't care to listen." As he spoke, he thrust out a hand toward Feng Xuan and snapped, "Money in one hand, goods in the other—stop wasting my time."

Feng Xuan suppressed his fury and said coolly, "My son suffered a setback at your hands the night before last. Young people should pick themselves up where they fall. Today, my son wishes to challenge you. Young Brother, do you have the courage to accept?"

As if to match his words, Feng Xi stepped forward, looking down at Yang Kai with utter disdain, completely lacking the timidity he had shown the previous night.

Feng Xi didn't think Yang Kai was anything special. The only reason he had suffered such a loss the previous night was because Yang Kai had borrowed the power of the Ice Heart Valley's Emperor Realm masters. He and Yang Kai had never actually fought head-on.

As the Young Sect Master of Wenqing Sect, Feng Xi had learned the most powerful techniques and secret arts in the world, and wielded formidable Secret Treasures. Among cultivators of the same realm, almost no one could match him.

In a one-on-one duel, Feng Xi believed he would not lose to anyone.

After last night and today, Wenqing Sect had lost face. If they wanted to regain their honor, they could only start with Yang Kai, the instigator.

Feng Xuan and Yao Zhuo could not attack Yang Kai directly. If they did, the Emperor Realm masters of Ice Heart Valley would never stand by, and it would mean all-out war between the two sects.

The only option was to have Feng Xi challenge Yang Kai and then kill him in front of everyone, restoring Wenqing Sect's reputation.

Feng Xi clearly understood his father's plan, so even though they hadn't discussed it beforehand, he immediately stepped forward with a provocative look.

Yang Kai glanced at him and grinned. "Young Sect Master, are you sure you're really his own flesh and blood?"

Feng Xi was stunned for a moment, then flew into a rage. "Brat, all you can do is talk big!"

Yang Kai sneered, "If you were really his own, why would Lord Feng be so eager to send you to your death?"

Feng Xi's face darkened. "You dare look down on me? If you have the guts, let's settle this on the arena. The winner will marry Zi Yu, and the loser will get out of the Northern Territory and never return!"

Zi Yu frowned in displeasure. "What does this have to do with me!"

This Feng Xi was really something, dragging her into this for no reason. It was infuriating. But then she remembered how Yang Kai had run his mouth the previous night, claiming in front of everyone that the two of them had already pledged themselves to each other. Zi Yu immediately realized this was just a jealous spat.

But that was just Yang Kai's excuse. Afterwards, none of the dozen or so Senior Aunts or Uncles had asked about it again, clearly understanding the truth. Only Feng Xi took it seriously—his intelligence was truly worrying.

Just for that, there was no way Zi Yu would ever be interested in Feng Xi.

"Hand over the Source Crystals first. Lord Feng, you don't intend to go back on your word, do you?" Yang Kai ignored Feng Xi's provocation and turned to shout at Feng Xuan.

Feng Xuan sneered, taking out a prepared Spatial Ring. "The Source Crystals are all here. But why are you changing the subject, Young Brother? Are you afraid of my son? If you are, just apologize. My son is magnanimous—he might forgive you."

"Give me the Source Crystals first, then I'll talk nonsense with you!" Yang Kai urged impatiently.

Feng Xuan snorted and, looking pained, tossed the Spatial Ring over.

Yang Kai caught it and swept his Divine Sense inside, his face lighting up with joy.

The ring didn't contain one billion, but it did have five million Upper-Level Source Crystals and five hundred million Middle-Level Source Crystals—exactly one billion in total.

It seemed Wenqing Sect really was filthy rich. They could just produce one billion Source Crystals at a word. Yang Kai suddenly regretted not asking for more—judging by Feng Xuan's expression, he could have gotten even more.

After confirming the amount, Yang Kai tossed the Bloodjade Qilin Seal back.

Feng Xuan didn't even look at it, just threw it to Feng Xi. "If you lose it again, you can forget about being Young Sect Master."

Feng Xi's face changed and he quickly said, "Rest assured, Father, I will keep it safe and never lose it again."

Feng Xuan nodded slightly, then looked at Yang Kai again. "What do you think of my earlier proposal?"

Yang Kai sneered, "Are you really so eager to send your own son to the Yellow Springs? Looks like he really isn't your own flesh and blood. No wonder, with so many wives and concubines, it's hard to keep track. It's only natural for your ladies to seek a little fun elsewhere now and then."

Hu Yuan and the others all wore strange expressions, wanting to laugh but not daring to, holding it in with great difficulty.

In all the world, who would dare speak to Feng Xuan like that? It was nothing short of declaring, in public, that Feng Xuan had been utterly disgraced. Once again, everyone’s understanding of Yang Kai’s sheer audacity was shattered—admiration mixing with deep unease.

They were truly afraid Yang Kai would completely enrage Feng Xuan. An enraged Third Stage Emperor Realm master was a disaster.

"Insolent brat!" Feng Xuan roared in fury. Anyone would lose their temper at such words.

Yang Kai shouted back, "What, Lord Feng, you were so spirited when slandering Senior Bing Yun earlier, but now that you're being slandered, you lose your temper? Your temperament is lacking. Compared to Senior Bing Yun, you're worlds apart."

Feng Xuan was stunned for a moment, but quickly regained his composure. The rage and agitation vanished, replaced by calm—he had clearly adjusted his state of mind.

After a moment of silence, he said coolly, "Let's put other matters aside for now. Today, your duel with Xi'er must take place!"

Yang Kai snorted, "Since you're so unreasonable and bullying the weak, I suppose I'll just have to accept."

Feng Xi was nothing to him. Even if Feng Xi had some trump card, Yang Kai was confident he could escape.

Thinking this, Yang Kai quietly asked Bing Yun, "If I kill him, will there be trouble?"

Bing Yun frowned slightly, but didn't doubt Yang Kai's words at all. She knew how powerful he was—he'd even killed Emperor Realm masters before. No matter how strong Feng Xi was, he couldn't compare. After a moment's thought, she said, "Best not to kill him. If you kill Feng Xi in front of everyone, Feng Xuan will never let it go. My Ice Heart Valley doesn't fear him, but if the two sects go to war, countless disciples will die. It's not worth it."

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded, a wicked smile curling at his lips. "Then I'll just cripple him."

Hearing this, Bing Yun glanced at the smug, eager Feng Xi and couldn't help but feel a trace of sympathy.

On the other side, everyone saw Yang Kai actually accept Feng Xi's challenge and had mixed expressions. The women of Ice Heart Valley were full of worry and anxiety. They didn't know how strong Yang Kai was, but Feng Xi was the Young Sect Master of Wenqing Sect—he surely had some tricks up his sleeve.

Even Zi Yu might not be able to retreat unscathed in a duel with him. Could Yang Kai really handle it?

On the contrary, Hu Yuan and the others were all excited. Not because two Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators were about to fight—they were all Emperor Realm masters, so such a duel wasn't much to see. But this way, the conflict between Ice Heart Valley and Wenqing Sect could be resolved through this duel, without destabilizing the entire Northern Territory. This was what they hoped for, so they were actually a bit grateful to Yang Kai for agreeing.

Anyone could see that Yang Kai had every reason to refuse this duel. Feng Xuan was just being unreasonable and throwing his weight around.

At this, Hu Yuan quickly said, "I remember there's an arena in the city. If everyone doesn't mind, shall we move there?"

Feng Xuan nodded. "In that case, let's go."

As he spoke, his body flickered, Emperor Yuan surging, and he took Feng Xi and disappeared. Yao Zhuo shot Yang Kai a cold, mocking glare and followed.

"Master, if it really comes to it, let Zi Yu go up instead. Against her, Feng Xi definitely wouldn't dare to go all out, and they're about evenly matched. She might not lose." Sun Yunxiu was straightforward and spoke her mind, not caring about Yang Kai's feelings. She was just short of saying outright that Yang Kai was no match for Feng Xi and would die if he went up.
