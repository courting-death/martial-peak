## Chapter 1997 — Dragon's Oppressive Might

After Qin Yu finished speaking, countless martial artists stirred with suppressed excitement.

Although they had previously thought the treasures on that altar were impressive, there had been no certain confirmation, and with so many martial artists eyeing the place, no one dared act rashly for fear of inviting death.

But now, hearing Qin Yu say this, everyone’s thoughts came alive.

The temptation of being able to achieve the Emperor Realm was enough to make them risk their lives.

“May I ask, Miss Qin, what dangers does the Dragon Ascension Altar have?” someone asked loudly.

“Danger… there certainly is; it might cost lives. But exactly what dangers… is not something I, Qin Yu, can know. After all, the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda is the Star God Palace’s shrine treasure, and the scriptures contain very little record of what’s inside; this is my first time entering, so…” she answered.

At her words, disappointment showed on many faces.

Although everyone knew Qin Yu surely had more she wasn’t saying, she had already revealed a great deal and had been more than forthcoming; to press further now would be to openly offend the Qin Family.

Everyone here eked out a living in Fenglin City—who would want to make enemies and perhaps be paid back later?

Qin Yu added, for reasons no one could tell, “However… it’s said the Dragon Ascension Altar itself is a Secret Treasure, and it was forged from Dragon Bone, so to approach the altar one must withstand the oppressive might of an ancient True Dragon.”

“Forged from Dragon Bone?”

“The Dragon’s oppressive might of an ancient true dragon?”

A chorus of astonished exclamations rose up.

At that moment, a hissing sound came from not far off, tearing through the air at great speed; everyone startled, instinctively circulating their power and looking around.

Then someone cried out, “Despicable and shameless—acting so furtively, how hateful!”

It turned out that while everyone’s attention had been drawn to Qin Yu and her description of the altar, some cultivator from an unknown power had concealed their form and aura and silently crept toward the Dragon Ascension Altar.

Their concealment arts were exceedingly profound; not a single person present had detected them.

If the Dragon Ascension Altar had not suddenly reacted, likely no one would have noticed until those people had taken the treasures off the altar.

But now… those people all revealed themselves—only four or five—splitting into several directions and cautiously approaching the altar.

Whether it was some unlucky fool stepping on a nearby restriction, suddenly the altar discharged lines of mysterious light which bombarded those people.

The attackers failed to notice in time; two of them died on the spot, blood splattering as their bodies were shattered, while the others, seeing the danger, hurriedly dodged and could no longer conceal themselves, their forms exposed.

Fortunately the altar’s restriction did not seem overwhelmingly powerful; after dodging, the two or three survivors were essentially unharmed; they exchanged glances, saw their cover blown, gritted their teeth, and regardless pressed forward.

“Damn it, they’re from the Ghost Dance Sect!”

“A bunch of jumping clowns, daring to covet treasure—truly courting death!”

“The treasure is mine!”

As soon as some people began approaching the Dragon Ascension Altar, the remaining martial artists could no longer restrain themselves; they employed movement techniques and surged toward the altar, each trying to reach it quickly and claim the treasures.

Jiang Chuhe reacted fastest; with a twist of his body he shot forward over ten zhang, leaping far ahead, eyes blazing as he fixed on a cultivation manual atop the altar, and swung his hand forward.

A rope-like Secret Treasure slid out from his sleeve and streaked toward the manual dozens of zhang away.

“Young Master Jiang—!” someone gasped in alarm.

“Hahaha!” Jiang Chuhe laughed, as if he already saw the manual in hand and himself invincible after cultivation, arrogance written all over him. “Treasure goes to the capable; this manual… belongs to Jiang.”

No sooner had he spoken than his smile stiffened; he stared at his rope Secret Treasure and cried out, “How can this be?”

The rope had only extended less than three zhang before it went limp and sagged as if its spirit were gone; no matter how he urged his power or formed hand seals, it would not move.

Not only him—those others who tried to use their Secret Treasures to seize the altar’s items all lost their mental link to their treasures in an instant.

While Jiang Chuhe stood stunned, it felt as if a tremendous force struck from the sky, sending him crashing to the ground; dust covered him and dirt filled his mouth and nose.

“Hahahaha! Young Master Jiang, your Vicious Dog Eating Dirt technique is truly perfected to the pinnacle—this one is impressed, impressed!” The martial artist burst into laughter and sprinted past Jiang Chuhe, not forgetting to mock him as he left.

“Damn you, I’ll remember you!” Jiang Chuhe rose up filthy and angry, cursing.

Looking about, everyone who had tried to fly straight toward the Dragon Ascension Altar met the same fate—each fell from the sky, tumbling miserably.

This discovery put Jiang Chuhe’s mind somewhat at ease.

In an instant, everyone understood: to obtain the treasures one must rely on oneself and physically reach the altar’s side.

But… that would by no means be easy.

From a distance they had felt little, but the closer they approached the Dragon Ascension Altar the more fierce the mysterious pressure became; in every martial artist’s eyes the altar seemed to have transformed into an ancient ferocious dragon, snarling and opening a blood-filled maw, waiting for prey to be delivered.

Some with weak minds, thin-willed or simply lacking strength, lost their composure and froze, eyes full of terror, their bodies trembling violently.

Others, even if they could resist that dreadful dragon might, still found each step arduous and could no longer advance as quickly as before.

On the other side, a group from the Qin Family still clustered around Qin Yu, and under her instruction they advanced toward the Dragon Ascension Altar at an unhurried pace.

Qin Yu coughed lightly from time to time, appearing calm, while the other Qin Family guards looked anxious, fearful someone would take the lead.

“Don’t rush!” Qin Yu finally breathed and said softly, “The Dragon Ascension Altar… is not so easy to approach. You should take this opportunity… to properly feel the oppressive might of the ancient True Dragon; it is of great use in tempering the mind. If you gain from it… you will be less embarrassed when facing powerful foes later.”

Though Qin Yu’s own cultivation was only Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, she carried great authority among her Qin Family guards; when she said this they truly calmed, each silently circulating mind methods to purge distractions, protecting Qin Yu as they slowly advanced while using the dragon might to temper their hearts.

Suddenly Qin Yu frowned and glanced in a certain direction.

There, Yang Kai grinned at her, looking entirely at ease as he strolled forward leisurely.

“This man…” Qin Yu peered long and hard at Yang Kai’s retreating figure, and to her surprise—she who had always been so sharp at reading others—found him oddly inscrutable.

He showed no eagerness for the treasures on the Dragon Ascension Altar; while others were fighting desperately, he walked as if in a garden, utterly composed and comfortable.

Qin Yu secretly shook her head, lowered her eyes, and when she looked up again an unusual light passed through her beautiful eyes, shining like stars.

At the same time Yang Kai’s whole body stiffened, as if some pair of eyes that could peer into fate were probing his secrets.

He spun around and met Qin Yu’s gaze.

For a moment Qin Yu trembled and began to cough violently.

“Miss!” the guards cried in alarm.

Qin Yu waved repeatedly, bent over and clutched a silk handkerchief against her mouth, coughing painfully; after a long moment she gradually recovered.

“It’s all right,” Qin Yu panted; when she looked again toward where Yang Kai had been, she found he was no longer there and could only sigh.

“That girl is very strange,” Yang Kai, mingling among the crowd, frowned.

He always felt that Qin Yu was no ordinary woman, yet her cultivation was only Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, which puzzled him.

Especially that look she had given him a moment before—as if she could see into his secrets—had sent a chill down Yang Kai’s spine.

Yang Kai vowed silently that, unless necessary, he would avoid contact with this woman in future, for fear his secrets might leak.

“Ah…”

At that moment a terrible scream rang out.

A cultivator already shaken by the dragon’s might stood frozen in place, shrieking; his eyes trembled as if he had seen some unspeakable horror, his power running amok as he flailed attacks wildly.

Moments later, with a sickening thud his head exploded; red and white matter sprayed about, and his headless body collapsed limply, a grisly sight.

Those nearby were struck with horror.

That was not the end—this man’s death seemed to act as a fuse; in the next moments screams erupted one after another from different spots, the victims suffering the same fate as the first: as if in a nightmare, their power ran wild, they struck blindly a few times, and their skulls burst.

“Dragon’s oppressive might!” someone shouted in terror.

Everyone understood how those people had died: they had been struck by the supreme Dragon Might on their Divine Sense and then met disaster.

For a time, the timid and the weak refused to advance any further and instead retreated to save themselves.

But as soon as they began to move back, the Dragon Ascension Altar suddenly spat out countless beams of mysterious light with hissing sounds.

Everyone was aghast.

Unexpectedly, those mysterious beams did not kill at random but targeted the retreating martial artists—none missed.

In the blink of an eye, more than thirty corpses lay scattered on the ground.
