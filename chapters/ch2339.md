## Chapter 2339 — Time Is Running Out

"From now on, you may come and go as you please." Qiu Ze said indifferently.

Shi Cangying was overjoyed at these words, knowing that Qiu Ze truly regarded him as the Sect Master of the Chiyue Sect—of course, only because he had bowed his head in submission. If he dared harbor any rebellious thoughts, Shi Cangying was certain he would meet a miserable end.

Qiu Ze's ascension to the Emperor Realm was bad news for any sect, but for Shi Cangying, preserving his own life was the most important thing.

The experts from Heavenly Extreme Hall and several other sects also stood behind Qiu Ze. Seeing him command with such authority, their hearts filled with envy, jealousy, and resentment. This was the power of the Emperor Realm—just standing here made others afraid to even breathe too loudly.

All these experts secretly resented that it was Qiu Ze, not them, who had broken through to the Emperor Realm.

Just then, an elder hurried over, cupped his fists in salute to Qiu Ze, and said, "Palace Master, Ye Hen refuses to reveal the method to enter the valley."

Before Qiu Ze could speak, Ruan Hongbo of Heavenly Extreme Hall spat, "That old fool Ye Hen really doesn't know what's good for him. Palace Master Qiu has shown great mercy by sparing his life, and yet he remains so stubborn."

Mu Guan of White Cloud Tower added, "Exactly. If Ye Hen won't cooperate, Palace Master Qiu need not be polite with him. If we all act together, I refuse to believe we can't break the valley's formation."

As he spoke, he looked eager to try.

Qiu Ze said coolly, "Do you know that Chiyue Sect has been passed down for tens of thousands of years? Even among the top sects of the Southern Territory, few can match its long history. The formation in this valley was personally set by a great master tens of thousands of years ago. Even I have no confidence in breaking it. Do you really think you few can manage it?"

His face was full of mockery. Mu Guan and the others dared not retort, only forcing awkward smiles.

"Sect Master Shi, what do you think?" Qiu Ze turned to Shi Cangying.

Shi Cangying pondered for a moment, then said solemnly, "Ye Hen is a tough nut to crack. I've worked with him for many years and know his temperament well. Even if tortured, even if killed, he would never reveal the method to break the formation!"

"Oh? Sect Master Shi, you hold Ye Hen in such high regard?" Qiu Ze looked at Shi Cangying in surprise.

Shi Cangying replied seriously, "He's just a stubborn old man. If not for that, our Chiyue Sect wouldn't have declined so much..."

"Enough. I have no interest in your Chiyue Sect's affairs. Just tell me how to break the formation." Qiu Ze interrupted impatiently.

Shi Cangying said, "Since we can't get anything from Ye Hen, perhaps we should try to find a breakthrough with someone else..." At this, he gave a sly smile. "Ye Hen and his daughter have depended on each other for years. Their bond is unusually strong."

Qiu Ze turned to look at him, his eyes deep and sharp.

Shi Cangying's heart skipped a beat, thinking he had said something wrong. Under Qiu Ze's gaze, he broke out in a cold sweat, but Qiu Ze suddenly smiled. "Sect Master Shi, that Ye Qinghan is someone you've watched grow up, isn't she? Don't you feel any pity for her?"

Shi Cangying's expression grew stern. "The girl is reckless, daring to stand in the way of Palace Master Qiu's grand ambitions. Of course she must pay a price. Precisely because I am her elder, I want her to mature quickly. This is a test of her character."

"So, you're doing this for her own good?" Qiu Ze's lips curled in a mocking smile.

Shi Cangying replied seriously, "I mean well. I hope she can understand."

Ruan Hongbo and the others listened on the side, all breaking out in cold sweats and glancing at Shi Cangying. It seemed only now did they see his true nature, and they felt sorry for Ye Hen for having raised such a monster. But then they remembered that they were now enemies of Chiyue Sect, so there was no reason to sympathize.

"Very well, I'll leave this matter to you. I hope Sect Master Shi won't disappoint me!" Qiu Ze smiled faintly.

"I will do my best!" Shi Cangying cupped his fists and said solemnly. Then he waved to the rear, shouting, "Bring them up!"

In the blink of an eye, Ye Hen and several high-ranking sect members who had always followed him were brought outside the valley. As soon as they arrived, they cursed and spat at Shi Cangying, their eyes red with hatred, wishing they could tear him apart. But Shi Cangying remained calm and composed, as if he hadn't heard a thing. Standing at ease, he called into the valley, "Niece Ye, open your eyes and look carefully. See who stands beside me."

His voice rang out loud and clear, echoing in all directions, clearly reaching deep into the valley.

Not long after his words fell, the scenery in the valley suddenly shifted. In an instant, the illusion that had lasted for tens of thousands of years was dispelled, and the true valley appeared before everyone's eyes.

Looking around, Ye Qinghan, Chi Yue, and the others could be seen clearly, only a few hundred zhang away from Shi Cangying and the rest. Beside them stood a Formation Foundation platform.

"Hmm?" Qiu Ze narrowed his eyes, staring at the platform. The next moment, he exclaimed, "A Space Array?"

With his keen eyesight, he could naturally see that the Formation Foundation platform was a Space Array, ancient and weathered. What puzzled him was why such a thing existed in this valley.

Where did this array connect to?

Qiu Ze couldn't help but look at Shi Cangying suspiciously.

Shi Cangying was just as confused. He had always known the valley was Chiyue Sect's forbidden ground, accessible only to the Sect Master, but he had no idea what lay within.

He had always thought the forbidden ground was the burial place of Chiyue Sect's past Sect Masters, which was why others were not allowed in. But now it seemed he was mistaken.

This forbidden ground seemed to connect to another place.

Noticing Qiu Ze's gaze, Shi Cangying gave an awkward smile. "This is my first time seeing it too. I have no idea what secrets are hidden here."

Qiu Ze snorted coldly, clearly displeased, but said carelessly, "That Space Array must be damaged. Otherwise, these people would have escaped long ago."

Shi Cangying quickly said, "Palace Master Qiu, your insight is truly sharp to have thought of that."

As the two spoke, Ye Qinghan had already seen Ye Hen, who was forced to kneel outside the valley. At this moment, Ye Hen was covered in blood, his breath weak, and his cultivation seemed to be sealed, leaving him powerless to resist.

Ye Hen was already old, and now, after such torment, his condition was even worse. He coughed blood continuously, making it hard to watch.

"Father!" Ye Qinghan cried out, tears streaming down her face, her heart aching so much she could barely breathe.

Hua Qingsi and the others saw this scene and looked grim, feeling sympathy.

After calling out, Ye Qinghan glared angrily at Shi Cangying. "Let my father go!"

Shi Cangying grinned. "Junior Nephew, you're a grown woman now. Senior Uncle won't waste words with you. If you want me to release your father, it's not impossible, but you should know what you have to do."

At this, his expression darkened and he shouted, "Undo the valley's formation, and I will spare their lives!"

Before Ye Qinghan could speak, Ye Hen shouted, "Qinghan, no matter what, you must not undo the formation..."

Shi Cangying's face darkened. He struck Ye Hen, completely restraining him so he couldn't even speak.

Seeing this, Ye Qinghan cried out, "Don't hurt my father... Senior Uncle, you're also of Chiyue Sect, and you're the Vice Sect Master. Why are you doing this? When has my father ever wronged you? Please, let him go! I'm begging you!"

Her desperate, heart-wrenching pleas echoed through the valley, the scene unbearably tragic.

But Shi Cangying was unmoved, only shaking his head regretfully. "Senior Uncle wants to spare your father's life too, but now I'm not in control of myself. I hope you can understand!"

As he spoke, he walked over to a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm elder, placed a hand on the elder's head, and looked at Ye Qinghan. "Junior Niece, watch closely. Before you open the formation, every ten breaths... I will kill one person!"

As he finished, he urged his Origin Qi, and the restrained Chiyue Sect elder's head exploded instantly, his body falling stiffly to the ground.

The sudden killing left Ye Qinghan pale and hopeless, and even Ruan Hongbo and the others were shocked and horrified. After all, the person killed was a Chiyue Sect elder, a fellow they had known for countless years. Yet Shi Cangying killed him without batting an eye, showing just how ruthless and vicious he was.

Only Qiu Ze smiled in satisfaction.

"Senior Uncle doesn't have much time. Think carefully." After killing one, Shi Cangying moved to another elder, placing his hand on the elder's head, then silently stared at Ye Qinghan.

Ye Qinghan bit her lip so hard it bled, staring at Ye Hen, who kept shaking his head, making it clear he did not want her to undo the formation.

Ye Qinghan was tormented. She knew undoing the formation would not end well, nor would it help her father's situation, but she felt guilty and uneasy about the elder who had just been killed.

She felt as if the elder had died because of her, as if she had killed him herself.

That elder had watched her grow up, cared for her, played with her as a child, taught her cultivation as she grew older, and now had died right before her eyes.

She could only watch helplessly, unable to help.

As time slowly passed, Shi Cangying was about to kill again. Ye Qinghan became completely lost, not knowing what to do.

Just then, Shi Cangying gave a sly smile and moved his hand from the second elder's head to the person beside him.

Ye Qinghan's face turned deathly pale, her body trembling violently.
