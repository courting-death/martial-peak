## Chapter 604 — Courting Death

Seeing the Spider Mother really brazenly sending her soul out, Yang Kai could not help but let a strange smile twitch at the corner of his mouth.

In a serious tone he admonished, “Spider Mother, you best not try any tricks inside my Sea of Consciousness. Though my rank is lower than yours, my Divine Sense is far stronger than that of an ordinary Divine Roaming—do not bring misery upon yourself.”

Hearing his warning, the last scrap of hesitation in the Spider Mother evaporated at once, and she transmitted a thought: “Rest assured, if you are willing I would like our souls to merge; but if you are unwilling, I will not force you.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly and lowered the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness.

In the next moment, the Spider Mother’s soul slipped into Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

On the boundless ocean, the Spider Mother’s spirit body gradually took form; unlike how she had appeared outside, now she truly looked like a human. Her upper body remained bewitchingly alluring, and her lower half was equally enchanting—two long legs, straight and proud, a verdant meadow of flesh brazenly exposed, not a scrap of clothing on her body.

She stood poised above Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, looking him over from left to right with no sign of nervousness.

She was a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast, equivalent to a Transcendent Realm expert among humans; Yang Kai was only a Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage. The absolute gulf in realm gave her every reason to be arrogant and fearless.

Yang Kai’s spirit body also quickly appeared before her. Taking one look, Yang Kai’s brow knit and he snorted, “Is this really the form you desire to evolve into?”

“Indeed.” The Spider Mother nodded lightly, full of springtime longing. She turned, radiant light flowing across her tender form, her rich hips and breasts enthralling, and she purred, “So? Are you tempted?”

“Licentious!” Yang Kai curled his lip.

“Heh heh…” the Spider Mother laughed coquettishly, entirely unconcerned. “Isn’t the Enchantress Queen with her Poison Widow constitution even more wanton? Enough idle talk—hurry and give me the secret of the Huasheng Pool.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. “Indeed, I don’t wish to waste words with you either.”

As he spoke, a grim, wolfish chuckle escaped him.

The Spider Mother’s expression gradually hardened. Staring intently at Yang Kai, his odd behavior made her swiftly realize something. Composed but cold-voiced, she said, “So this was a trap.”

“Indeed.” At this point Yang Kai no longer needed to pretend.

“Hmph.” The Spider Mother sneered, “Your acting was convincing—said so much and did so much, all to lure my soul into your Sea of Consciousness.”

“Now you know. But it is too late.”

“You think with your current Divine Sense you can do anything to me? If I wish to leave, I can go at any time!”

“You are mistaken. I said before: don’t take on a job you lack the skill for. Since I have drawn you in, you will not be allowed to leave.”

“How presumptuous!” the Spider Mother shrieked. Her spirit body blazed into a streak of light as she tried to extricate herself from Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness.

No sooner had she moved than the boundless ocean erupted, towering waves surging up as if the Milky Way had fallen to block the heavens, cutting off every avenue of escape.

The Spider Mother’s spirit body slammed left and right but could not break through the watery barrier. Forced, she manifested again, her cold eyes staring at Yang Kai as she screamed, “How can your Divine Sense be so powerful?”

This man’s Divine Sense was not at all inferior to hers; it even surpassed hers by a hair. If not for this, she would not have been unable to flee.

“Tell me how to purge the deadly toxin in Shan Qingluo’s body and I will let you go; otherwise you will be obliterated here!” Yang Kai’s face was merciless.

“Deluded!” The Spider Mother’s expression turned fierce. Barely contained, she leapt at Yang Kai like a crazed hag, baring claws and fangs, aiming to merge their souls and disturb his mind.

Suddenly a sense of majesty rippled through the Sea of Consciousness. Detecting it, the Spider Mother could not help but panic and froze, craning her head toward the source of the aura. In midair a single eye slowly opened; within that single eye was a streak of golden pupil that stirred in the Spider Mother a compulsion to bow and worship.

Whoosh—

A beam of golden light suddenly shot from that single eye, grazing the edge of the Spider Mother’s spirit body and streaking outward.

Sizzling—

The Spider Mother’s spirit body resembled snow exposed to the scorching sun, instantly partially purified.

A shrill, agonized howl tore from the Spider Mother’s lips; her beautiful eyes filled with disbelief and terror.

“What is this? What is this?” the Spider Mother demanded fiercely.

“Something that restrains you.” Yang Kai remained calm. “If it strikes you squarely you will be destroyed in an instant—your thoughts, your consciousness, will vanish. That last strike was only a warning. I have no time to bargain; disclose your secret now, or do not blame me for being ruthless.”

The Spider Mother stared hard at Yang Kai, then looked up at the opened Golden Pupil Eye. A vengeful hatred warped her lovely face.

She panted heavily; that snow-white breasts rose and fell violently—she was clearly furious.

“I’ll give you three breaths. If after three breaths I have not received the answer, you will die.” Yang Kai’s face was icy as he issued his final ultimatum, raising a hand to count, “One, two…”

“Wait!” the Spider Mother cried out loudly. “I can tell you, but you must promise me—after you learn the secret, release me!”

“I promise.” Yang Kai nodded gravely.

The Spider Mother stared at him for a long moment before waving a fair hand. A pearl-white glimmer of light separated from her spirit body and drifted toward Yang Kai.

That pearl-white light contained the Divine Sense-energy that held the secret. By dividing that energy from herself, the Spider Mother would lose that portion of her memory.

To her, that was a form of injury.

Yang Kai’s face brightened as he reached out and drew it in. Before he could examine it closely, the Spider Mother suddenly lunged at him as if possessed.

Her body wrapped around him tightly, and she laughed wildly, “I will devour your spirit body—your Divine Sense is so powerful it will suffice me for a long while. Ha ha, now that we are this close, will you dare use that golden light?”

She thought that by doing this Yang Kai would hesitate, unable to act against her.

At the same time, a wicked Divine Sense force surged to harass Yang Kai, enveloping his spirit body and inducing a sensation like falling into an abyss.

Yang Kai stared coldly at her, utterly unmoved. “Since it is under my control, it naturally cannot harm me. You are too naive.”

The Spider Mother’s smile froze on her face; looking into Yang Kai’s eyes she finally showed a trace of terror.

Whoosh—

A blinding sheet of golden light descended and pierced through the Spider Mother’s enticing form.

There was no sound; the Spider Mother’s thoughts and consciousness were shattered in an instant, leaving behind only a cluster of pure energy.

“You sought your own death.” Yang Kai shook his head. If the Spider Mother had not tried to strike at him in her final moment, he would not have minded letting her live—after all, they had no great debt between them.

He probed the memory-energy the Spider Mother had separated out with some unease, and his expression turned strange.

The Spider Mother had not lied: that chunk of memory-energy did indeed contain the method to resolve Shan Qingluo’s constitution problem. But that method… required the Spider Mother’s death!

It was necessary to obtain her fresh blood and her Demonic Core, and have Shan Qingluo take them—using poison to counter poison—to purge the toxin from her body.

Fate’s sins can be forgiven, but one’s own sins are unforgivable.

Yang Kai shook his head again and again.

He did not immediately absorb the pure energy left by the Spider Mother’s death. Yang Kai opened his eyes at once.

The giant spiders gathered around him seemed to sense the Spider Mother’s demise; as Yang Kai opened his eyes, he found they were fiercely attacking him.

Snorting coldly, Yang Kai’s True Yuan surged forth. Unmatched ripples of energy shot out, and the giant spiders fell dead and wounded in great numbers.

Sixth-Tier giant spiders were only on par with Divine Roaming Realm cultivators. Enemies of that level were no longer worthy of being taken seriously by Yang Kai.

After killing for a time, the giant spiders suffered heavy casualties and the survivors retreated. Yang Kai did not pursue. He leapt onto the spider statue and went to where the Spider Mother lay dead.

He thrust his hand into her chest and pulled out a Demonic Core that shimmered with seven-colored light. Enormous energy dwelled within it; as Yang Kai took it, his hand went numb and quickly turned black.

Such potent toxin! Yang Kai’s face changed and he hastily tossed it into the Black Book Space, using his cultivation to disperse the invading poison in his body.

He also took some of the Spider Mother’s fresh blood, then quickly departed.

Two days later, Piaoxiang City.

No sooner had Yang Kai returned than he heard sobbing coming from Shan Qingluo’s room.

Changing expression, he hurriedly pushed the door open.

Inside, Bilo lay draped by Shan Qingluo’s bed, weeping in pear-shaped tears. Yunli and the two maidservants Ruoyu and Ruoqing were also beside her, their eyes streaming.

The whole room felt like an oven, stifling with heat.

That heat was emanating from within Shan Qingluo’s body.

Her breathing was rapid, her delicate body flushed like a hot iron, and her consciousness fuzzy.

Seeing Yang Kai return, Yunli brightened with joy and hurriedly said, “Young Master Yang is back.”

Bilo froze for a moment, then turned her head. Her eyes were swollen with tears; anxious and hopeful, she stared at Yang Kai and her lips trembled, as if wanting to speak but unable.

“How is she?” Yang Kai asked urgently.

Bilo shook her head slowly and then covered her face in fresh sobs—it was clear the situation was dire.

“Move aside.” Yang Kai roughly pushed her away, sat on Shan Qingluo’s bed, took out the Spider Mother’s Demonic Core and blood, pried open the Enchantress Queen’s mouth, and without ceremony forced the Demonic Core in and then poured half a handful of the Spider Mother’s blood down her throat.

“What are you giving Madam?” Bilo demanded anxiously.

Yang Kai offered a brief explanation.

Bilo gaped. “You killed the Spider Mother?”

“Yes. Now only poison can counter poison.” Yang Kai drew a breath. “Let us hope it works.”

“If anything happens to you… you must die with me!” Bilo looked at Yang Kai wronged and plaintive.

Yang Kai glanced at her, annoyed and disinclined to indulge her, and climbed onto Shan Qingluo’s bed. Helping her up, he placed a hand on her fevered shoulder and circulated his True Yuan to neutralize the energies contained within the Demonic Core and the Spider Mother’s blood.
