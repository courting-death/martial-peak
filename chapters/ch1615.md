## Chapter 1615 — It's Him

A breakthrough to the Void King Realm — such a scene is encountered once in ten thousand years, rarer even than the opportunities of the Blood Prison Trial; would they give up the chance before them just because Yang Kai said a word?

They wished they could move even closer!

"Please, everyone, give this Yang a little face; this Yang will be forever grateful!" Yang Kai seethed with anger in his heart, itching to intimidate them with force, yet for Qian Tong's promotion he had to suppress that fury and speak politely.

"Who do you think you are? We're standing here and not bothering anyone, and we're not rampaging about — this isn't your private place, you can't forbid others from standing here." Someone shouted in displeasure.

"Exactly, exactly — a mere Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and he dares to point fingers here; begone or I'll cripple you!"

"Young man, go find somewhere cool to stay; this is not a place where you can speak at will."

A group of people jeered and taunted, not taking him seriously at all.

Yang Kai's face turned ashen!

"Gentlemen, this is a crucial moment for someone's breakthrough — is it appropriate for you to come here and make such a fuss? When you ascend one day, shall I come bother you in return?" Xu Binbai chuckled softly; his voice was low but carried to everyone's ears.

"Kid, who do you think you are?"

“These youngsters nowadays really have no respect for their elders or care for the young—speaking so recklessly like that, they’ll suffer for it sooner or later!”

"You're courting death — that fellow is Lord Wudao's disciple; how dare you speak to him like that."

Not everyone was ignorant of Xu Binbai's background; some had overheard a conversation between Xu Binbai and an elder of Yuling Pavilion outside the Blood Prison and thus knew his status was exceptional, so they quickly warned others in hushed tones.

"What? Lord Wudao's disciple? Are you kidding me?"

"No way — it's said Lord Wudao hasn't shown his face in centuries; when did he ever take a disciple?"

"Believe it or not, it's up to you; haha, don't blame me if you come to regret it later."

"Uh... it's true. Look at the emblem on his chest — that's clearly the mark of Lord Wudao's Three-Flower Divine Skill; only those closest to Lord Wudao are qualified to wear it."

"My heavens — Lord Wudao's disciple? Their future attainment will be boundless."

"Could it possibly be fake?"

"Who would dare joke with that emblem? Do you want to die?"

"So it would seem. This person really is Lord Wudao's disciple..."

After learning of Xu Binbai's identity, those few previously arrogant cultivators who had not taken Yang Kai seriously went white-faced, regretting their earlier impertinence for speaking without first checking Xu Binbai's background.

Xu Binbai gave a delighted chuckle. "Moreover, that man is about to ascend to the Void King Realm. If you dare act so presumptuously now, aren't you afraid he'll come after you once he succeeds?"

At these words, everyone changed color!

If Xu Binbai's identity made them wary, this remark filled them with dread.

They had only been watching the spectacle out of curiosity and had not considered this layer; Xu Binbai's reminder made them realize how foolish they'd been.

Indeed, that person was about to ascend to the Void King Realm — if the breakthrough failed, there would be nothing more to say, and the man would likely be obliterated in the Heaven-and-Earth Energy's Baptism, but if he succeeded and rose to become a Void King Realm expert, would he not settle scores later?

Remaining here to observe was courting death!

With that thought, several faces drained of color; those who had shouted at Yang Kai earlier cupped their hands to Xu Binbai and said, "Thanks for the warning!"

Saying so, they hastened to step back, wearing awkward smiles, and bowed from a distance toward Yang Kai. "Young Brother, forgive our earlier offenses — it was thoughtlessness on our part; please do not hold it against us!"

The others likewise offered sheepish laughter and gentle words.

Yang Kai's expression brightened slightly and he nodded lightly. "No need for courtesy, everyone — I was at fault earlier too. If you would simply stand a little farther away so as not to affect my senior's promotion, I naturally would not interfere."

"All right, all right — young Brother, you speak plainly and frankly; we thank you."

The disturbance dissolved as if by magic; almost everyone nearby behaved sensibly and withdrew.

Yang Xiuzhu and Chu Hanyi discreetly wiped cold sweat from their brows.

Yang Kai descended and gave a faint nod to Xu Binbai, thankful. "Thanks to Brother Xu for defusing that; I will remember this favor."

"No trouble, Brother Yang needn't mind," Xu Binbai replied with an easy smile.

At that moment, a burst of murmurs swept through the crowd.

"My heavens — Lord Luo Hai has arrived."

"The commotion here has indeed attracted Lord Luo Hai; after all, he is the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star."

"So many Void King Realm experts! Isn't that Elder Lei of the Sword Alliance?"

"Look — that is our Purple Star's Li Wanning, Elder Li."

"That is Old Jiu of the Hengluo Commerce Guild..."

Seven or eight Void King Realm experts were recognized at once; unlike Wudao, they were not inscrutable recluses — although they also kept to themselves, they still showed their faces occasionally, and in the entire Star Domain they carried great renown.

These Void King Realm experts came from the distant horizon, led by Luo Hai, the others close behind; in the blink of an eye they were among the crowd.

An invisible pressure emanated from them, and everyone nearby involuntarily took a large step back; within a radius of thirty zhang around them a vacuum-like zone formed.

"Tsk tsk — this Blood Prison opening truly produced a Void King Realm ascension; judging by his stance, he's clearly touched the threshold of a Domain; if luck favors him, he'll definitely ascend!" Elder Jiu of the Hengluo Commerce Guild clicked his tongue; his hawk-like gaze pierced the hills of Spiritual Qi and locked onto Qian Tong's position. He said with suspicion, "I've never seen this man before and don't know which force he's from."

The beautiful woman of Purple Star, Li Wanning, chuckled. "Elder Jiu, are you planning to woo him? If so, just say it plainly; no need to hide it."

"What would I be hiding? Aren't you all thinking the same?" Elder Jiu snorted lightly.

The others laughed without speaking; clearly Elder Jiu was not wrong.

"This man must be worth wooing, but I myself am also quite curious about that miraculous youth. Lord Luo Hai, where is that youngster now — is he here?" An old woman of the Sword Alliance leaned on her cane and asked with a smile, scanning the area and fixing her gaze on anyone who appeared to be Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Luo Hai’s expression flickered slightly, but he made no attempt to conceal it. He nodded and said, “Indeed, he is here. As for who it is—surely, with your Divine Senses, it won’t be difficult for you all to find out, will it?”

“Since Lord Luo Hai has said so, then we shall put on a humble display!” a burly man chuckled, and in the next instant, his vast Divine Sense spread out in all directions.

The others did likewise.

In an instant, seven or eight layers of Divine Sense belonging to Void King Realm experts piled together, enveloping all the cultivators and making every person shudder in fear, not knowing what these high masters intended.

"It's him!" Elder Jiu suddenly called in a low voice, fixing his gaze on Yang Kai; a fierce light flared in his sinister eyes.

Immediately those around him noticed Yang Kai's presence.

After all, among over a thousand people present, those at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm were not many, and among them Yang Kai's Saint Yuan was the most robust and condensed, his life force and Qi and blood the most vigorous.

“This boy truly is impressive. Look at how refined his Saint Yuan is — at least twice that of an ordinary Third-Stage Origin Returning cultivator. No wonder he could slaughter his way through the Blood Prison,” Elder Jiu said with a satisfied smile and a slight nod.

"I'm curious what body-tempering cultivation method he practiced; his physical body looks very powerful," matron Lei said with a sliver of doubt in her eyes.

"This kid is no ordinary fellow."

"Why stand here and judge him? Go and talk to him yourself — are you afraid he'll eat you?" Li Wanning pursed her lips and smiled, swaying her hips as she walked toward Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes fixed on his face.

Yang Kai immediately frowned.

The arrival of these Void King Realm experts had stunned Yang Kai for a long time; he had thought it was the commotion from Qian Tong's promotion drawing them here, and his heart fluttered, not knowing what they intended.

A Void King Realm expert is spectacular in power; seven or eight of them together would make anyone uneasy.

He had been on edge when he saw the beautiful woman walking toward him, staring without turning away, which left Yang Kai puzzled.

Following the beautiful woman, the others also looked at him and strolled over...

What did they want to do?

Yang Kai's Saint Yuan involuntarily circulated and his expression grew extremely wary.

At his present strength, he was invincible below the Void King Realm, but facing a Void King Realm expert he likely only had the option to flee — one mishap and he could be killed in a single move.

The gulf between the Void King Realm and the Origin Returning Realm is immense; otherwise the Star Domain would not have so many cultivators trapped at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm for their whole lives, nor would Void King Realm experts be so few in number.

"Brother Yang, don't be nervous." Xu Binbai's voice suddenly came from his side; seeming to see Yang Kai's vigilance, he chuckled and said, "They likely bear you no ill will."

"How do you mean?" Yang Kai asked softly.

"Well, after every Blood Prison Trial the Void King Realm experts of the great forces try to woo some outstanding cultivators; this time should be no exception. I suppose they have their eye on you — they intend to recruit you, not harm you."

"Recruit me?" Yang Kai frowned. "There were others who came out of the Blood Prison besides me — why single me out?"

Xu Binbai beamed. "Naturally because Brother Yang's performance in the Blood Prison was flawless; to be honest, I felt great pressure facing you!"

"My performance... how could they know what I did in the Blood Prison?" Yang Kai's face darkened.

"They might not know all the details, but Lord Luo Hai of Cuiwei Star can sense some things — he is the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, after all," Xu Binbai explained.

Yang Kai's expression suddenly changed as he realized the situation was grim.
