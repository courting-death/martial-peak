## Chapter 1509 — Battle Sky City

When Yang Kai first studied the Incarnation Technique, he knew that if he could find a suitable vessel and inject a Soul Incarnation to work in concert with it, it could become an avatar-like existence — something to send to places his main body could not go, or to do things his main body could not.

For example, Yang Yan was the Great Emperor's avatar.

The Great Demon God was only at the Saint King realm, yet with his prodigious talent he comprehended the Incarnation Technique and grasped secret arts only the Great Emperor had mastered — it was clear that his becoming a legend was no empty reputation.

The Golden Stone Puppet had no intelligence, but its body was intact; wasn't that precisely an ideal vessel?

Yang Kai stroked his chin, gazing at the Golden Stone Puppet without a word, musing to himself.

After a long while he decided to give it a try; whether it would succeed he did not know, but it was surely better than leaving the Golden Stone Puppet in its idiotic state forever.

He ordered Xiaoxiao to guard nearby. Yang Kai sat cross-legged before the Golden Stone Puppet. His Divine Sense power, vast as an ocean, surged, and a gray, hazy shadow suddenly shot from his mind.

The shadow was somewhat insubstantial and unsteady, but on closer inspection its outline bore a resemblance to Yang Kai.

This was naturally the Soul Incarnation Yang Kai had nurtured in his Sea of Consciousness for many years.

The Soul Incarnation rushed into the Golden Stone Puppet's mind and vanished in an instant.

……

In Lingxiao Sect's council hall the sect's Origin Returning Realm disciples had all gathered. Presiding was Great Elder Ye Xijun; seated below were Chang Qi, Hao An, Ge Qi, Ning Xiangchen, and the Deacons Wu Yi and Qian Yue, who were also present in the hall.

Not only them; Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were here as well.

The great hall was silent. Each person had a cup of tea before them, and disciples kept stepping forward to replace cups of tea that had gone cold.

"Where has the Sect Master gone? It's been more than a month and we haven't seen him. I had people look into it; it seems he's not in Tianyi Palace," Chang Qi asked Ye Xijun with concern. "Great Elder, do you know where the Sect Master is now?"

"He is still within the sect, but I do not know what he is busy with; it seems he is cultivating some secret art. It concerns something grave, and I dare not pry. Wait and see," Ye Xijun replied calmly.

With her formidable cultivation she had naturally sensed the recent abnormality at that mountain peak, so she could be sure of Yang Kai's location. Yet as she said, since he was cultivating some secret art, she had no intention of spying.

“Sect Master will definitely return. Before leaving, he already laid out the course of action for this operation. When he discussed it with me, I found no issue with it. This time, all of you are to accompany him; as for the Sect, it will be left in the care of Deacons Wu Yi and Qian Yue.”

"Yes." Wu Yi and Qian Yue answered upon hearing this.

"Also, Elder Huang Juan is in seclusion breaking through; you must take good care not to disturb her. And Yun'er — that girl is too lively. With me gone she may be restless; you two should watch her closely and ensure she cultivates properly."

“Please rest assured, Great Elder. Senior Sister Qian Yue and I will see to everything within the Sect,” Wu Yi said solemnly. “But all of you—please be sure to return safely.”

“Mm. With the warship personally forged by the Lord, this expedition shouldn’t pose much difficulty. By the way—have the personnel and supplies aboard the warship been properly arranged?”

"All in order!"

"Good." Ye Xijun nodded slightly, then turned to Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu. "Junior brothers, thank you for your efforts this time."

“Senior Sister Ye is too polite,” Qian Tong chuckled. “Last time, Old Fei and I were ambushed and captured—had Yang Kai not turned the tide and rescued us, the two of us would’ve long been silenced! For this operation, we naturally cannot shirk our duty.”

Fei Zhi Tu nodded in agreement. If not for Fang Peng and Qu Zheng's treachery that day, he would never have fallen to such a state — his hair gone white, his cultivation reduced a level. Whenever he recalled it he seethed with hatred.

"Hm? The Sect Master is here." Ye Xijun's expression suddenly changed as she looked toward the hall entrance.

The others reacted as well, turning their attention.

Sure enough, after a moment a rainbow of light shot over and, as the brilliance dissipated, revealed Yang Kai's figure. He looked somewhat tired, but his eyes were bright and sharp.

"Has the Sect Master come upon some good fortune?" Ye Xijun seemed to suspect something.

"Sort of." Yang Kai nodded lightly without explaining much. Scanning the hall with his gaze, he asked in a low voice, "Is everything ready?"

"Yes!"

"Then let's go!" Yang Kai smiled brightly.

Everyone rose and headed outside.

In the plaza the Void King-Grade Warship was already docked, its hatch wide open. A number of people filed in; after a while, accompanied by a humming roar, the warship surged like thunder and lightning and sped away, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

……

Battle Sky City loomed vast and imposing, covering a huge area. Tens of thousands of warriors passed through its streets year-round, and shops of all sizes lined the lanes.

This was the headquarters of the Battle Sky Alliance. As one of Dark Star's two great powers, the Battle Sky Alliance was a household name and naturally drew countless warriors here like a stream of fish crossing a river.

Some came hoping to join the Battle Sky Alliance, some to seek opportunities, and others to set up shops and earn Saint Crystal.

Battle Sky City was one of Dark Star's largest cities, divided into an inner city and an outer city.

The outer city served as the place where the Battle Sky Alliance interacted with cultivators from the outside world, with various shops scattered throughout. The inner city, however, was accessible only to Alliance disciples—any trespassers were to be killed without mercy.

Battle Sky City had stood on Dark Star for thousands to tens of thousands of years, growing ever more prosperous. This was inseparable from the Battle Sky Alliance's might. Every power had its rise and fall; the Alliance was no exception, and despite its great name it had also drawn enemies.

Over the millennia the city had been attacked several times by powerful foes, yet each time disaster had been averted. Even when the Alliance was weakest and short on experts, it still held.

The most dangerous time was several thousand years ago, when Guyang Sect launched a fierce assault.

Back then, aside from the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect, there was also a sect called the Guyang Sect, which stood on equal footing with them—its influence even surpassed the other two by a fair margin. For reasons unknown, conflict eventually arose between the Guyang Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance, and in the end, blades were drawn.

The Battle Sky Alliance was the weakest of the three powers then, with few strong experts, and could only defend helplessly.

Guyang Sect's elite forces were deployed in full; they stood at the city's gates, and the Alliance teetered on the brink.

Yet after a great battle the Alliance, though suffering heavy losses, held firm. Guyang Sect inflicted a thousand wounds upon the enemy but suffered eight hundred casualties itself, and in the end had to retreat.

What the Alliance relied on was the inner city's Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array.

Most sects seldom set up their main headquarters inside a city; they usually chose high mountains, for a city's comings and goings would disperse Spiritual Qi and hinder disciples' cultivation.

Rumor had it the reason the Battle Sky Alliance placed its headquarters in Battle Sky City was that the inner city contained the Condensed Jade Ice Spring, whose endless cold emanations formed the power of the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array, with the spring serving as the array's focal point.

After that battle the fame of the Ten-Thousand Cold Spirit-Sealing Array spread far and wide across Dark Star.

Later, Guyang Sect offended Star Emperor Mountain and was annihilated overnight; its ruins became the now-famous Zangxiong Valley.

Yang Kai and Yang Yan had been there once. From that place Yang Kai obtained the Sun's True Essence and the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade Platform; it was also where he acquired the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi.

Without Guyang Sect's constraint, the Battle Sky Alliance could flourish; otherwise whether it would still exist today was uncertain.

As one of Dark Star's two superpowers, the Alliance had long made other sects cower and act at its whim.

Yet two months ago rumors began to spread through the city.

Word was that the Alliance had offended someone it ought not to have, and its situation had become precarious, like treading on thin ice.

Nine times out of ten people scoffed at the news.

What could the Battle Sky Alliance have offended that it needed to be so cautious? If it didn't start trouble, who would dare to rouse it? Apart from Star Emperor Mountain there was no one who could make the Alliance back down; even Leitai Sect lacked such power.

But there is no smoke without fire. The Alliance's recent restrictions — sealing its borders and allowing exit but not entry — caused much speculation.

Over countless years the Alliance had acted arrogantly, and many sects and families had suffered extermination for refusing to bow. Even those who did submit were heavily extorted, breeding deep hatred. Now, seeing the ominous signs, many secretly hoped for its downfall.

Some suspected the Alliance had actually offended Star Emperor Mountain and feared it might follow in Guyang Sect's footsteps.

If that were true, it would be a thing to rejoice at.

At any rate, the city's atmosphere was indeed different from before. Everywhere Alliance disciples hurried about, frantically stocking up supplies as if preparing for some looming calamity.

At this moment two Origin Returning Realm First Stage warriors were flying slowly above the city. Both wore Battle Sky Alliance uniforms, but unlike ordinary disciples the uniforms bore the crossed-sword emblem, giving them a menacing air.

Law enforcers!

A city as large as Battle Sky had its law enforcers patrolling. Should anyone break rules or cause trouble, they would be punished by the enforcers.

Those who committed grave offenses would lose their lives; the lesser ones would merely be fined Saint Crystals.

Thus warriors in Battle Sky City feared those wearing such garb — one misstep and they'd be targeted.

At this moment the two enforcers both looked troubled and burdened.

"Brother Huang, what do you think is going on? Since the Alliance Master and the Great Elder returned, they've issued a string of baffling orders, and now disciples are being told to buy supplies like mad. Do we have war coming?" the short-haired burly man on the left asked suspiciously.
