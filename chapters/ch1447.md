## Chapter 1447 — A Fair Proposal

Compared to Kong Wendong, the young woman still held a bit of initiative; after all, she had only used Yang Kai and had not directly made him an enemy, so with a quick thought she immediately cried in a sweet voice, "Young brother, truly impressive — I knew you would be all right."

As if she had foreseen it all.

Yang Kai snorted and walked forward leisurely. He said, "Spare me the flattery, madam — is what you just said still valid?"

The young woman was stunned for a moment, then beamed with delight and quickly nodded, "Of course it stands!"

"Good." Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction. "If so, once this is done I will take half of the gains from that cave dwelling. If you agree, I will act at once to help you; if not, consider my offer never made."

"Half?" The woman stared at Yang Kai in surprise, her expression immediately souring as she snapped, "Young brother, don't you think that proposal is unfair?"

"How is it unfair?" Yang Kai asked with a playful smile.

"You are only one person, and you are but at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, while our Ice Heart Valley counts three people — even if divided, you could at most take a quarter or less. Half… ha, don't you think you're asking for too much?"

"I do not." Yang Kai shook his head seriously. "If I had not intervened, you would not have obtained anything inside. If anything is gained, it will be because of my participation. So a half share is a fair and reasonable proposal for both you and me."

"Impossible!" The woman shook her head like a rattle, resolute. "I cannot agree to that. At most I will decide to give you a fifth. If you won't accept, then forget it."

“Is that so?” Yang Kai’s smile deepened as he looked at her with interest. “Even if their reinforcements arrive later, you still won’t agree?”

"What did you say?" The woman's face changed.

"What I said — can't you see for yourself?" Yang Kai replied indifferently.

The woman was no fool; hearing him she immediately turned and glanced toward the four over there. A moment later her beautiful eyes narrowed and her expression turned cold. The reason was plain: she had seen the Origin Returning Realm warrior she had gravely wounded secretly pouring his Divine Sense into the Transmission Compass, apparently trying to contact someone — whether he had succeeded she could not tell.

Seeing this, the woman instantly knew the matter could no longer be delayed. She bared her silver teeth and cried, "Fine — half it is! As long as we obtain what is inside that valley, I will not break my word!"

"I hope you keep your word!" Yang Kai gave her a meaningful glance. A chill ran through the woman's heart; for some reason she felt a twinge of unease.

But she quickly shook off the thought. For now, the main thing was to drag this brat into the affair. How the spoils would be distributed after they obtained the valley's treasures was another matter; that would be up to her. Giving him ten or twenty percent would be plenty.

Half… utterly laughable. He should count himself lucky she had no intention of burning the bridge after crossing it—if he failed to recognize his place later, it wouldn’t be too late to make a move then.

With that thought she flashed a faint smile.

Throughout Yang Kai's negotiation she had received no interruption from Kong Wendong. He knew full well he and Yang Kai were enemies now; arguing more would be pointless. When they finished he gave a sinister grin and said, "Kid, you really think you're someone special?"

“Why don’t we let our hands do the talking?” Yang Kai grinned, not bothering to trouble Kong Wendong. After all, that man was the strongest among the four from Fire Radiance Sect—dealing with him would be troublesome. Instead, Yang Kai fixed his sights on a middle-aged man at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. The man wore a dark robe and had three long whiskers, giving him a somewhat immortal air, yet his face was ruddy and his skin smooth like that of a newborn child.

Golden Blood Threads flicked from Yang Kai's fingers and shot toward the dark-robed elder, immediately enveloping him in their onslaught.

Seeing Yang Kai strike with such decisiveness—without the slightest hesitation—and even choosing an opponent a whole realm above his own, the three women from the Ice Heart Valley all lit up with delight. The leading young woman let out a sharp cry and took the initiative to engage Kong Wendong, while the other two each picked their own targets, pairing off in fierce combat.

On the Ice Heart Valley side, aside from the leading young woman at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the other two women were at the Second Stage and the First Stage respectively.

Likewise, among the Fire Radiance Sect there remained cultivators of those same stages.

However, that First-Stage cultivator on the opposing side had already been heavily injured by the young woman. For the Ice Heart Valley woman, finishing him off would take little effort—just a matter of time. Once this battlefield reached its conclusion, they could move to reinforce the others.

A slight advantage could snowball into a large one; when that happened, Fire Radiance Sect would inevitably suffer a catastrophic collapse.

The woman quickly forecasted the unfolding battle and, while her heart rejoiced, she cast a worried glance toward Yang Kai — that prediction depended entirely on Yang Kai being able to tie down the dark-robed elder.

If Yang Kai were killed shortly thereafter by the Fire Radiance elder, that rosy forecast would come to nothing.

She had to pay more attention to Yang Kai.

She had expected the fight there to be one-sided, that Yang Kai would barely hold on and be hard-pressed, since the opponent he chose was a stage above him.

But when she looked, she was taken aback!

The battle was indeed one-sided — but not as she had imagined; it was the Second Stage dark-robed elder who was barely holding on.

A vast golden light shrouded the elder, cutting through the void with a hiss as if severing space itself. Enclosed by that radiance, the elder was locked into complete defense, with no opening to strike.

The leading young woman's eyes nearly popped from her head!

Startled and almost bested by Kong Wendong, she hastily gathered her spirit and hurled herself into battle with him again, no longer able to spare attention for Yang Kai.

At the same time, the dark-robed elder's face had gone ashen; he had not expected this First Stage youth to be so troublesome.

Those strands of golden thread were incomparably sharp—who knew what kind of secret art it was? Wherever they swept, golden light filled the sky, and whenever his protective Saint Yuan was sliced by them, cracks would instantly appear.

The dark-robed elder was forced to invoke his defensive treasure-armor, yet even so he felt the edge of those threads.

What distressed the elder most, however, was that his Shi could not envelop the opponent. In Origin Returning Realm duels, the power of Shi could be decisive.

If one's Shi were stronger, encircling and crushing the enemy's Shi could reduce their combat effectiveness and make them far easier to deal with.

The dark-robed elder had never taken Yang Kai seriously; he meant to seize initiative with his Shi. Yet no sooner had he started to release it than those golden threads shredded it, preventing it from forming let alone encircling Yang Kai.

Those golden threads actually had an effect that could break Shi! The elder's face went pale; he no longer dared to underestimate Yang Kai. With a fierce shout his hands opened and shut, and a basin-sized ball of flame suddenly appeared before him. He hurled it forward and the fireball headed straight for Yang Kai.

Halfway there the fireball exploded violently, splintering into countless smaller fireballs that filled the sky with terrifying momentum.

Yang Kai lifted an eyebrow and snapped his fingers in quick succession; clusters of pitch-black Demonic Flame shot forth to meet those fireballs.

"Playing with fire?" The dark-robed elder sneered. As a Fire Radiance Sect practitioner who had devoted a life to flame, he considered himself an expert in all fire arts and secret techniques. Though the youth might possess a shi-breaking technique, in a contest of fire arts he believed himself superior.

He adopted the posture of one amused at a spectacle.

Yet in the next moment his smile froze and his expression changed as if he had seen a ghost in broad daylight.

The black flames gave off an icy chill surpassing even the cold techniques of Ice Heart Valley's cultivators. At first the black flames revealed nothing special, but as they flew they twisted and transformed into small flocking birds. Seemingly chaotic, they nonetheless struck the elder's flames with pinpoint accuracy.

"Yuan Control Art!" The dark-robed elder's eyes narrowed in horrified recognition.

Although the Yuan Control Art was something cultivators of the Origin Returning Realm could come into contact with, not everyone could master it. The robed elder had studied and practiced it himself, but his understanding was only superficial—nothing like Yang Kai’s ability to precisely manipulate every strand of Saint Yuan that left his body.

Achieving that required not only practiced skill but also a powerful Divine Sense!

How could someone at only the First Stage possess such capability? The elder inwardly cried out and knew danger at once.

Though both were fire in nature, once controlled by Yuan Control Art, Yang Kai's assault proved markedly more potent.

Sure enough, each black bird that met the elder's fire immediately froze and extinguished the burning flame, while the birds themselves suffered little loss. They then regrouped into a larger Fire Bird that dove at him.

"Taste my fire as well!" Yang Kai grinned, and with a thought the frigid Demonic Flame he wielded turned blisteringly hot.

Demonic Flame could be cold or hot; its temperature shifted with Yang Kai's intention, mysterious and unpredictable.

The dark-robed elder was taken unawares and suffered greatly.

The rapid change from cold to heat left him with no time to prepare. He hurriedly produced a shield-shaped secret treasure that transformed into a flux of light to guard at his side, but in the next instant his whole body was wrapped by Demonic Flame.

Just as Yang Kai stepped forward, believing the strike would finish the elder, his expression suddenly grew grave and he immediately drifted backward.

Boom — with a deafening crash the elder's defensive shield exploded; using the blast of the treasure the elder's figure flickered and he vanished from his original spot, reappearing more than ten zhang away.
