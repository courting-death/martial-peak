## Chapter 1140 — What Is This Power

Thinking this, Xie Hongwen actually strode forward to seize the woman, but no sooner had he taken a step than one of the two Origin Returning Realm experts blocked him.

"Young Master, something's odd up ahead; it should be a formation of considerable power." The warrior frowned, staring at the vast space before the cave as his Divine Sense swept back and forth.

When they came, Ian had told them how a dozen or so Xu Family Third Stage of the Saint King Realm warriors had been annihilated, but everyone had taken it lightly—thinking even a formation's might would be limited and couldn't stop the Origin Returning Realm's bombardment. Only when they drew near did they discover the formation's clear and extraordinary sophistication.

"Strange?" Xie Hongwen was not a fool; he nodded and said, "Mm, this young master won't go up — better not to fall into their trap."

At that moment, Yang Yan had finished what she was doing and hurried back into the cave to hide behind Yang Kai, her delicate body trembling; Wu Yi grasped her hand and gently patted her.

Xie Hongwen drew his gaze away from Yang Yan and cast a sidelong look at Wu Yi, emitting a cold, cruel laugh and a face full of malice as he shouted, "Wu Yi, don't say this young master won't give you a chance—if you're sensible, come along obediently and return with me; this young master can let bygones be bygones. If you're not sensible, don't blame this young master for being ruthless."

Wu Yi's face turned pale, but she still said, "You're dreaming if you think I'll go with you—only if you kill me!"

"Good, good, good." Xie Hongwen didn't get angry; instead he laughed. When he learned Wu Yi was involved with Yang Kai he had indeed been furious, but now he saw Yang Yan, who was even more outstanding than Wu Yi. The resentment immediately dissipated; this time he could not only have Wu Yi but also this voluptuous beauty—two birds with one stone—so Xie Hongwen was naturally delighted.

He no longer paid attention to Wu Yi and instead looked at Yang Kai, sneering coldly, "Kid, you've got some nerve daring to set your sights on my woman; no matter where you come from, you're dead. Roll over here and kowtow to confess, call me "grandfather" a few times, and this young master might give you a reprieve—if you can hand that woman over to me. Heh heh. I might spare your life!"

Yang Kai frowned. He'd seen many second-generation heirs, but he'd never met one as arrogant as Xie Hongwen, who seemed to think that anyone and anything should bow at his words. First he demanded Wu Yi obediently follow him back, then he wanted Yang Kai to crawl over—who did he think he was?

“This guy only knows how to boast?” Yang Kai glanced at Wu Yi.

Wu Yi replied scornfully, "He's not right in the head."

“Mm, well said. His head really isn’t right—probably got twisted because of his body's defect.” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Seeing him so calm, the tension in Wu Yi and among the others seemed to dissipate considerably.

On the other side, when Xie Hongwen said he'd spare Yang Kai, Ian actually spoke up: "Young Master Xie, this man is of unknown origin—he has occupied our Haike Family's Dragon Lair Mountain and turned host into guest. Drive him out or slay him, we ask you to uphold justice and kill him!"

Since they had decided to snuff Yang Kai out early, lest he grow to threaten the Haike Family's interests, Ian naturally would not let him go easily. As for Wu Yi, she had already left the family and was no longer of the Haike Family—what fate awaited her if Xie Hongwen took her back was none of his concern.

"Do I need you to boss me around when I act?" Xie Hongwen glared at Ian; Ian's face turned awkward and he fell silent.

Immediately Xie Hongwen bellowed towards the cave, "Kid, you've got nerve—daring to set your sights on my woman and seize another family's territory. You hold Yingyue Hall in such low regard? Do you not know the Haike Family is an outer force of Yingyue Hall?"

"If you want to fight, then fight—stop the nonsense!" Yang Kai was too lazy to argue; the fellow was mad, and talking more was a waste—ultimately it would come down to action.

"Fine, today I'll let you know what it means to offend me. Don't worry, I won't kill you immediately. That woman should be yours, right?" Xie Hongwen pointed at Yang Yan. "You dare touch my woman, I'll take your woman—I'll show you how I satisfy her; don't feel inferior then!"

Saying so, he shouted, "Hong Zhen, seize that brat—damn him, how dare he offend me—he's gone too far!"

The Origin Returning Realm expert called Hong Zhen frowned and hesitated, "Master, there's a formation over there!"

"What formation? A few small arrays stop you? What use are you then?" Xie Hongwen leaped up. "If one isn't enough, send two—I'm not believing that trash array can stop you. Hurry and grab him; I'll throw him on the ground, step on his face, and piss on it."

Hong Zhen's face turned so dark it nearly dripped ink.

A First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert was already considered powerful on the Dark Star; after all, the strongest here were only Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. But he was ordered to protect Xie Hongwen and couldn't refuse his command.

The other Origin Returning Realm expert looked at him as if to say something. Hong Zhen waved his hand, "I'll go try; if I can't do it, you join me."

"Fine." The man nodded without another word.

Hong Zhen then stepped toward the cave; his Divine Sense burst forth to probe the surroundings, but the more he searched the more alarmed he became. The space felt like a quagmire—his Divine Sense fell into it with no response. He instantly realized he'd underestimated the formation's power.

Retreat was already too late; he had clearly entered the formation's range. What surprised him was that the other side showed no sign of activating the formation—perhaps it couldn't be activated.

Moreover, the young man opposite, a First Stage of the Saint King Realm, actually walked straight toward him, which both surprised and delighted Hong Zhen.

"Yang Yan, Little Sister, open the formation!" Wu Yi anxiously grabbed Yang Yan's small hand. Last time the Xu Family's dozen-plus men fell into a formation and were easily slain by Yang Kai; now Yang Kai actually charged an Origin Returning Realm expert, and Wu Yi naturally worried.

A First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and a First Stage of the Saint King Realm are a full great realm apart. Even if Wu Yi had great faith in Yang Kai, she didn't believe he could defeat a master like Hong Zhen.

Yang Yan shook her head. "Yang Kai says not to open the formation yet."

"Why?"

"I don't know either."

She soon understood why Yang Kai didn't want her to activate the formation, because Yang Kai actually charged first at Hong Zhen, the long sword rolling with Demonic Flame appearing leisurely as a jet of pitch-black sword radiance slammed toward Hong Zhen.

Yang Kai was clearly testing his combat capability.

"Overreaching!" Hong Zhen sneered coldly and without any flourish threw out a punch. The moment his fist was unleashed the atmosphere in a radius of a hundred zhang shifted as if space itself had been stirred.

Yang Kai's face changed; he had long known the vast gap between a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm and the Origin Returning Realm, but he had not expected Origin Returning Realm attacks to be so bizarre.

The power driven by that fist was not immense, but as Hong Zhen struck Yang Kai a strange sensation arose—as if an invisible force wrapped him, instantly slowing his Saint Yuan's circulation; his movement became much more laborious, and even the speed of the pitch-black sword radiance he slashed out fell precipitously.

His strength was suddenly suppressed a great deal.

What is this power? Yang Kai was slightly shocked. On his journey he'd met many Origin Returning Realm experts, but he'd never fought someone of this realm before—this was his first time.

He suddenly realized Origin Returning Realm warriors seemed to possess a peculiar power capable of suppressing lower-ranked opponents. He didn't know whether it was unique to Hong Zhen or common to all Origin Returning Realm elites.

He was desperate to find out what kind of power this was.

Back on the Tongxuan Continent, if he ran into problems in cultivation, he could still seek guidance from people like Meng Wuya. But here, there was no one who could help him. If he wanted to find answers, he would have to slay an Origin Returning Realm cultivator and absorb that person’s comprehension of the Heavenly and Martial Dao—only then might he grasp the mysteries of this power.

As his thoughts raced, the winds rose and roiled; a fierce Wind Blade surged from Hong Zhen's fist, cleaving through the pitch-black sword radiance and in an instant streaking to Yang Kai's front.

If his power hadn't been suppressed, Yang Kai could have dodged, but now his movements were much slower than usual, and when he sensed the Wind Blade he couldn't evade it.

That Wind Blade carried wildly violent force; Yang Kai believed that even with his strong physique, taking that strike would certainly injure him.

Wu Yi cried out, worry evident in her beautiful eyes.

"Lowly wench!" Xie Hongwen jumped and cursed again. Wu Yi's concern for Yang Kai displeased him greatly; he secretly decided to strip and brutally violate her before dozens of people here and then discard her, so she'd learn the consequences of offending him.

Yang Yan, however, showed indifference and didn't even intend to open the formation.

With a thunderous "boom..." the giant Wind Blade struck Yang Kai, and his body was flung backward at high speed.

"Huh?" Hong Zhen had thought Yang Kai surely dead, but he quickly saw that a purple shield had appeared before Yang Kai. Purple radiance flowed over the shield; Spiritual Qi pressed outward—clearly a high-grade treasure. The Wind Blade struck it and left not even a scratch.

"An Origin-Grade Secret Treasure?" Hong Zhen's eyes lit up with greed.

With his discernment he could naturally tell the treasure's quality, and he also knew the treasure hadn't been fully refined—this youth must have acquired it not long ago.

If he could seize an unrefined Origin-Grade Secret Treasure, his strength would surely increase greatly.

"Impressive!" Yang Kai looked at his purple shield, swayed his body to calm the tumult in his chest, and unabashedly praised it.
