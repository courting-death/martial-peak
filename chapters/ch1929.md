## Chapter 1929 — Yin Lesheng

"Yang Kai, you absorbed the most starlight; how much of the power in your body has been converted now?" Gu Cangyun asked suddenly, his concern plain.

When his words fell, everyone involuntarily turned their heads to look at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai sensed briefly and then said, "About one percent."

"So much!" Wudao exclaimed in alarm, and the others looked at him with expressions of envy.

"Is that a lot?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

Wudao gave a wry smile. "A great deal. The conversion in my body is less than one ten‑thousandth, yet even so it has benefited me enormously. You have converted one percent; before long, I fear all the power in your body will be fully transformed!"

"Indeed. At my rate, even if I stayed here, it would still take at least five or six years to convert all of my Saint Yuan," Chi Yue nodded.

"What about Chairman Ai Ou?" Everyone turned their gaze to the other person they were concerned with.

"Much worse than boy Yang—only about one tenth of his amount," Ai Ou said slowly, shaking his head.

"That's still quite fast," they couldn't help but sigh.

No one had expected that as a Star Lord, upon entering here Yang Kai would gain such exceptional benefits; the speed at which his body's power converted was something they could not hope to match.

They chatted idly a while longer, then decided they could not afford to dally—such a chance did not come around often. Once more they split into two parties to absorb the starlight and press on with their journey.

......

Somewhere roughly a hundred thousand li away from where the others were.

This place was likewise filled with starlight, identical to the environment Yang Kai and the others stood in.

And yet here, startlingly, three figures were present.

The three consisted of two men and one woman; none of them seemed old, all dressed like young cultivators, but each bore an incredibly mighty aura.

One of them had a dark, fierce expression and sat cross‑legged in the sea of starlight like a beast in hiding; his presence made others recoil, so much so that the other two kept their distance and dared not approach.

All three were cultivators of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Around where they sat there was a semicircular energy barrier enveloping them; that semicircular shield displayed some strange property that actually blocked the surrounding starlight from intruding.

Thus the place where the three were seated was utterly clean within a radius of around a dozen zhang — nothing at all remained there.

The man who resembled a crouching beast kept his eyes tightly closed. His hands formed a profound hand‑seal as if cultivating some secret art, and fierce surges of energy rolled out from his body from time to time.

Although all three shared the same Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation level, the other man and woman were clearly far inferior to this man.

Suddenly the bald man among the two opened his eyes, impatience showing on his face. After looking around a while he muttered, "We've waited here five years already—how much longer must we wait?"

Hearing him, the woman beside him opened her eyes. She glanced at the center and said in a low voice, "Be patient, Brother Feng. Has five years been long for us? Thanks to Senior Brother Yin Lesheng's provision of the Huangquan Nether Veil we could remain in the Starlight Passage and already have benefited greatly."

When she mentioned Yin Lesheng, the bald man, Feng De, cast a somewhat wary look toward the man radiating murderous qi and then nodded. "Indeed. We could only stay here because of the Huangquan Nether Veil Senior Brother provided; otherwise the Starlight Passage would reject anyone after only two months. Yet… to just keep waiting isn't a solution, is it? What exactly is Senior Brother waiting for here, Junior Sister Liu — do you know?"

Liu Qianyun shook her head slowly. "I do not know. Only that Senior Brother surely has his plans."

Feng De forced a bitter smile. "Enough of that. Speaking of which, Junior Sister Liu, how much of the Saint Yuan in your body has been converted?"

"About one fifth," Liu Qianyun said with a wry smile, looking over at Yin Lesheng with some envy. "He cannot be matched; I think his Saint Yuan has almost entirely converted to Origin Qi! Once he leaves this Starlight Passage he might advance to the Dao Origin Realm at any moment."

"The body of a Star Lord is indeed extraordinary," Feng De exclaimed with feelings. "Had I known, I should have tried to refine a Cultivation Star myself."

"How perilous is it to refine a Stellar Origin?" Liu Qianyun said, slowly shaking her head. "Without a supreme providence it's impossible to succeed. In our Great Wilderness Star Domain over the past nearly ten thousand years, how many Third Stage Void King experts have died trying to refine a Stellar Origin? I myself have never dared to attempt it without absolute certainty. Besides, we can come to the Star Realm now and search for a Stellar Origin later—there's no rush."

Feng De shook his head slowly. "Even so, I hear Stellar Origins are exceedingly rare within the Star Realm; many strong ones even sever their own cultivation and risk plunging deep into the Starlight Passage to return to the great Star Domains. We missed our chance before; it will likely be difficult to obtain a Stellar Origin again."

Liu Qianyun's expression dimmed; she knew Feng De spoke truly.

"You two are quarrelling so loudly this Lord cannot find peace," a sudden cold voice said.

Liu Qianyun and Feng De both trembled and fearfully raised their heads, just in time to see the man who had been sitting cross‑legged, Yin Lesheng, open his eyes.

Those eyes were chillingly cold, showing no emotion at all, making anyone who looked upon them extremely uncomfortable.

Liu Qianyun forced a smile and said apologetically, "Junior Sister and I were merely chatting idly; we did not mean to disturb Senior Brother Yin Lesheng — please do not blame us."

Yin Lesheng's expression was indifferent; he said nothing more.

Feng De frowned and asked, "Brother Yin, we have waited here five years; must we continue to wait?"

"You wish to leave this place?" Yin Lesheng asked Feng De with a cool glance.

Feng De answered, "If Senior Brother can tell us what exactly you are waiting for, Feng De would gladly risk his life to accompany you. It's just that… ever since entering the Starlight Passage you have remained here in seclusion, Senior Brother, and I am…"

"Are you dissatisfied with my methods?" Yin Lesheng's voice turned cold.

Feng De looked displeased and frowned, "I would never dare say that, only…"

Before he could finish, his vision blurred — Yin Lesheng had somehow already appeared before him. Under those icy eyes, Feng De felt a chill run down his spine and a murderous aura envelop him; terrified, he cried out and reflexively struck forward.

"No!" Liu Qianyun's face changed as she cried out.

Yin Lesheng snorted coldly. Facing Feng De's terrifying blow, he did not dodge but casually raised a hand and dispelled the attack, then opened his palm and grabbed Feng De by the throat.

In an instant, Feng De, also of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, was subdued; his powers faltered, and he was lifted like a chick by Yin Lesheng.

The scene was simply unbelievable; even Liu Qianyun stood frozen.

Only then did she realize she had long underestimated Yin Lesheng. He must have fully converted the Saint Yuan in his body into Origin Qi; otherwise, with equal cultivation he could not have subdued Feng De in a single move.

Indeed, Yin Lesheng had been strong before coming here, but not so overwhelmingly formidable.

Yet after coming here, the distance between them had suddenly widened.

This was the direct manifestation of Saint Yuan having been converted into Origin Qi.

"Brother Yin…" Feng De struggled, but could not break free from Yin Lesheng's grip. A look of absolute terror filled his eyes as he felt death calling him; his face turned deathly pale.

"If you were not also from the Great Wilderness Star Domain, do you think I would kindly allow you to enjoy the benefits of the Huangquan Nether Veil? You are ungrateful and dare to question my conduct — you deserve to die!" Yin Lesheng reprimanded coldly, adding pressure to his grip, making Feng De's soul reel.

Liu Qianyun's face had gone pale; she wanted to plead, but thinking of Yin Lesheng's cruel methods she could not bring herself to speak.

She knew that if she provoked Yin Lesheng's anger, Feng De would not be the only one to die.

She forced a smile and said, "Senior Brother Yin, have mercy. Junior Sister and Brother Feng know our fault; please spare Brother Feng."

"You know your fault?" Yin Lesheng asked indifferently.

Feng De nodded hastily.

"Let this be the last time!" Yin Lesheng sneered and casually tossed Feng De aside as one would throw away a broken hemp sack.

Liu Qianyun wanted to go help him, but dared not move, only watching Yin Lesheng anxiously.

After punishing Feng De slightly, Yin Lesheng did not press the matter further. He folded his hands behind his back and said nonchalantly, "I do not wish to take things to the extreme. After all, you both come from the Great Wilderness Star Domain like I do, and my Huangquan Sect has a legacy in the Star Realm. Once we enter the Star Realm you will join my Huangquan Sect; in the future we will still be family."

Liu Qianyun forced a smile and replied, "If Senior Brother Yin says so — then I will humbly obey."

The reputation of the Huangquan Sect in the Great Wilderness Star Domain was not particularly good; it was likely not renowned in the Star Realm either. Yet the sect possessed many powerful experts, and few dared to offend it. Entering the Star Realm and joining it might well smooth one's future cultivation.

Still… to be stained by the Huangquan Sect's ill repute made Liu Qianyun uneasy in her heart.

But now that events had reached this point, she had no choice.

Feng De, having narrowly escaped death, was grateful and dared not show the slightest defiance.

Yin Lesheng was pleased with their attitudes and took the initiative, "Do you want to know why I have delayed entering the Star Realm and waited here?"

Liu Qianyun and Feng De exchanged a look. She said, "If Senior Brother is not at liberty to speak…"

"There is nothing I cannot say," Yin Lesheng replied calmly. "Since you both will join the Huangquan Sect and are not outsiders, I can tell you. The reason I have waited here all this time is to await cultivators from other Star Domains entering the Star Realm."
