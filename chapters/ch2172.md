## Chapter 2172 — Winter Domain

“To become this Lord’s meal is your honor. Who wants to go first?” Qiong Qi swept his fierce gaze across the crowd, asking in a deep voice.

No one dared to answer. Every Emperor Realm present was pale, their bodies trembling, and a deep sense of oppression weighed on their hearts.

“Not speaking, are you…” Qiong Qi’s tone was mocking. “If you won’t speak, then this Lord will just pick one at random. None of you can escape anyway, it’s only a matter of time. Don’t be afraid…”

“Lord Xiao!” Lou Chi, Vice President of Ziyuan Commerce Guild, couldn’t help but call out, looking earnestly at Xiao Yuyang, as if pinning all his hopes on him.

Xiao Yuyang’s expression darkened. Realizing that if he didn’t act now it would be too late, he could only summon a golden, mirror-like object. As soon as it appeared, it suddenly shattered.

At the same moment the mirror-like object shattered, a gentle yet ocean-deep pressure descended from the sky. Within the shattered space, a majestic figure slowly emerged.

Everyone turned to look, their expressions solemn, all showing reverence and worship toward the figure.

The man wore a jade belt and golden crown, his posture as upright as a mountain, his aura deep as an abyss, and his presence unfathomable.

When he appeared, his form was misty and insubstantial, clearly no true body; yet in the next breath, two gazes as solid as steel pierced the void and locked directly onto Qiong Qi.

Even Qiong Qi, as strong as he was, couldn’t help but restrain his aura, snorting coldly, “Emperor’s soul descent?”

From this apparition, it sensed the aura that only an Emperor possessed, and naturally understood what the figure was.

This was clearly a wisp of the soul of the master of this world—Radiant Moon Emperor!

Like two brightest lights in the darkness, as Qiong Qi focused all his attention on the Emperor, the Emperor was also closely watching him.

“This Lord truly did not know that Qiong Qi still existed in this world!” Radiant Moon suddenly spoke.

“Hmph.” Qiong Qi was not intimidated, replying coldly, “When this Lord roamed free, you might not even have been born yet. What’s with the act in front of me?” He showed no respect for Radiant Moon, sneering, “What, you think a mere soul descent is enough to scare me?”

As the man and beast exchanged words, their clash was like a collision of tangible energies. The void collapsed, pressure filled the sky, tiny spatial cracks spread everywhere, and in an instant, the world was dark, sand flew, and nameless valley nearly collapsed.

Xiao Yuyang and the others didn’t dare make a sound. Each stood solemnly, secretly urging their Origin Qi to resist the terrifying pressure from all directions.

“Lord Qiong Qi jests.” Radiant Moon, one of the few true experts in the world, didn’t mind Qiong Qi’s arrogance at all. Instead, he smiled slightly, “I only wished to congratulate you on finally gaining your freedom!”

Qiong Qi’s eyes darkened, and he asked in a low voice, “What do you know?”

Radiant Moon replied, “When I was young, I heard that Lord Time had a playmate, the Divine Spirit Qiong Qi. Sadly, after Lord Time passed away, this playmate also disappeared, and for tens of thousands of years, no one knew your whereabouts. Do you still remember those happy days?”

“Time…” Qiong Qi seemed awakened by Radiant Moon’s words, memories dormant for countless years resurfacing. The arrogance and violence in his aura gradually faded, and his burning beast eyes were filled with reminiscence.

Radiant Moon stood quietly, not disturbing him, and Xiao Yuyang and the others didn’t dare move at all.

After a long while, Radiant Moon finally said, “Would Lord Qiong Qi care to visit my Star God Palace? This Lord has a relic of Lord Time that might be passed on to you!”

“Hmph, trying to curry favor won’t work!” Qiong Qi snorted, shaking his head, then said, “This Lord is hungry.”

Radiant Moon smiled, “Everything will be prepared for you.”

“That’s more like it!” Qiong Qi said loudly, “Since you’re so sincere, this Lord will give you some face. What harm is there in going?”

“Radiant Moon awaits your good news. Here is the location of my Star God Palace!” Radiant Moon said, pointing forward. A ball of pure white light slowly flew out from his fingertip, arriving before Qiong Qi.

Qiong Qi swallowed it in one gulp, stood in place thinking for a moment, then turned and vanished in a flash of fire.

After Qiong Qi left, Xiao Yuyang and the others finally let out a long breath. A cool breeze swept by, and their backs were sticky and cold with sweat.

Radiant Moon glanced at the crowd, said nothing more, and with a shake of his body, turned into countless white lights, dispersing into the world.

“We respectfully see you off, Lord!” All the Emperor Realm bowed with cupped fists as they spoke.

After a while, the six Emperor Realm slowly straightened, exchanging glances, all seeing lingering fear in each other’s eyes. Though they were all experts in this world, since advancing to the Emperor Realm, never had they been so close to death as today!

“If not for Lord Xiao, today’s events…” Zeng Yuan said with lingering fear.

“Indeed, if not for Lord Xiao, we might truly have died here today,” Lou Chi nodded in agreement.

Xiao Yuyang’s mouth twitched, and he smiled bitterly, “It was the Emperor who saved us… not my doing. But… now that Qiong Qi has appeared, I fear the Southern Territory will be plagued with disaster.”

Hearing this, everyone’s hearts sank.

Qiong Qi is a baleful beast, the very embodiment of calamity and war. Its reappearance will surely stir up unpredictable, vicious tides. Everyone silently resolved that once they returned to their sects, they would immediately report to their leaders and make preparations in advance.
…

In Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai traveled alone, crossing Two Seasons Mountain, heading toward the Winter Domain.

Not long ago, while he and Murong Xiaoxiao waited in Two Seasons Mountain, she used the Sect’s Transmission Compass to contact Xiao Baiyi, who was nearby. After meeting, Xiao Baiyi naturally didn’t show Yang Kai any kindness.

After all, at the Platform of Discourse, Yang Kai had openly defeated Xiao Baiyi, but also cut off his path to further exploration and opportunity!

Otherwise, in the final palace where treasures were seized, Xiao Baiyi would at least have claimed a spot, and might have gained something extraordinary.

Knowing Xiao Baiyi held a grudge, Yang Kai didn’t linger. After a brief word with the two, he set off alone for the Winter Domain.

On the way, he took out the Fiery Red Bead to examine, but couldn’t figure out its use. Whether probing with Divine Sense or infusing Origin Qi, the bead showed no reaction.

Helpless, Yang Kai could only store it in his Spatial Ring for now.

At this moment, Two Seasons Mountain was peaceful.

Whether it was due to the recent appearance of the Time Temple or Qiong Qi’s emergence, Yang Kai hadn’t encountered a single Demonic Beast along the way.

Two days later, he successfully crossed Two Seasons Mountain.

Ahead lay a completely different world.

All he could see was white—snow everywhere, silver covering the land, heavy snow falling, and the ground blanketed in more than ten feet of snow.

As soon as he entered, the pervasive cold enveloped him, seeping through his pores, chilling his blood and condensing his soul.

Braving the wind and snow, Yang Kai explored this world of endless white.

In Four Seasons Land, each domain’s natural environment was completely different. In the Summer Domain, the sun blazed and temperatures soared, but in the Winter Domain, it was the exact opposite.

The Calamity Fruit grows in extremely cold places, and the Winter Domain’s environment was indeed perfect for such a spirit fruit to be born.

Holding onto a sliver of hope, Yang Kai didn’t find the search too arduous.

He trekked through the Winter Domain, crossing mountains and rivers. Though he occasionally found rare spirit flowers and fruits, he saw no sign of the Calamity Fruit.

The omnipresent cold made his Origin Qi drain at least twenty percent faster than usual.

Helpless, he summoned Liu Yan to accompany him.

Liu Yan, as a fire-type Artifact Spirit who had devoured many exotic flames, naturally feared no cold. Moreover, her presence beside Yang Kai dispelled most of the chill for him as well.

Liu Yan thoughtfully stayed close to Yang Kai, constantly using her heat to drive away the cold around him.

Unlike other domains, the Winter Domain seemed almost deserted. Even if a cultivator was teleported here upon entry, they would likely try to leave as soon as possible.

Unless, like Yang Kai, one had a special purpose, no one would linger in such an environment.

Thus, Yang Kai spent several days here without seeing a single person. It seemed he was the only one in the entire Winter Domain.

Three days later, somewhere in the Winter Domain, Yang Kai looked around, his face full of confusion.

He was completely lost in this silver world, unable to even tell directions.

For an expert like him, this was almost impossible, but the Winter Domain’s environment was so harsh and unique that even Yang Kai couldn’t move freely or remember the way.

Looking back, he saw that his footprints had already been covered by snow.

“What’s wrong?” Liu Yan asked with concern.

“Hmm, seems I’m lost,” Yang Kai replied calmly.

Liu Yan smiled, “Even that can happen…”

“It’s fine. At worst, I’ll just fly in one direction until I leave. But searching aimlessly like this, it’s unlikely I’ll find anything.” Yang Kai sighed.

“Too bad… I can’t help you much,” Liu Yan answered sadly.

Yang Kai grinned, “Just staying by my side is the greatest help.”

Liu Yan’s lips curled into a smile, but in the next moment, she suddenly exclaimed in surprise.

Yang Kai sensed something was wrong and quickly looked at her.

Liu Yan stood there, her beautiful eyes fixed in one direction, her expression constantly changing. After a long while, she said, “Master, I think I’ve found something interesting!”

“What is it?” Yang Kai asked.

“Wait for me, I’ll be right back!” As she spoke, Liu Yan turned into a streak of fire, shooting forward and quickly disappearing into a snowy peak ahead.
