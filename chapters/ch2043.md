## Chapter 2043 — Token

When Yang Kai returned to Fenglin City, the sky had already gone dark.

He entered the city as if he'd done it a hundred times before and headed straight for his cave dwelling.

He deactivated the dwelling's wards and slipped inside.

Before he had even steadied himself, an excited voice suddenly called out, "Sir, you're back?"

Yang Kai was momentarily taken aback; when he turned to look he suddenly remembered there was someone else in the dwelling — that little maid from the Zhang Family, Zhang Ruoxi.

He had spent these years roaming outside mostly alone, so sudden company felt somewhat unfamiliar; besides, he'd been busy these past few days with Liu Yan's matters and had almost forgotten Zhang Ruoxi's presence.

Coming to his senses, Yang Kai gave her a slight nod.

"Sir, you've worked hard these past few days; it must have been difficult for you out there," Zhang Ruoxi murmured, bowing her head.

Her voice was so soft that had the dwelling not been utterly still, Yang Kai might not have heard her.

Looking her over, Yang Kai noticed the little maid seemed nervous; her small hands twisted the hem of her clothes and she appeared ill at ease.

Liu Yan's voice sounded in his mind with a teasing lilt, "Master, who is this maid? She looks afraid of you. Her strength isn't high — did you kidnap her from somewhere? But...the little maid is rather pretty, a good face and a good figure, tsk tsk..."

Before Liu Yan finished, Yang Kai's mind shifted and he tossed her into the Xuan Realm Pearl, cutting off their connection.

Within the Small Xuan Realm, Liu Yan froze for a moment, then snorted, "Guilty conscience!"

After speaking, she casually searched out where the Sun’s True Essence lay, transformed into a Fire Bird to envelop it, devouring the Sun’s True Fire and swelling her own power.

Inside the dwelling, Yang Kai watched Zhang Ruoxi; with her anxiously waiting, he asked, "You've been waiting here the whole time?"

If she hadn't been waiting here, he wouldn't have seen her the instant he entered the dwelling.

"No. I only just came here," Zhang Ruoxi replied, keeping her head bowed.

Yang Kai didn't believe her. He glanced around and saw the dwelling had clearly been tidied, neat as new, and he smiled, "Sit. I have something to tell you."

Zhang Ruoxi hurriedly waved her hand, "No need, Sir. I'm fine standing."

Yang Kai sighed. With one reach he pulled her over and, while she remained stiff, pressed her into the chair; he then walked to the opposite seat and sat down.

After pausing to choose his words, Yang Kai said, "Ruoxi, is it all right if I call you that?"

Zhang Ruoxi slowly shook her head and did not speak.

Yang Kai smiled and softened his tone, "If you won't speak, I'll take that as agreement. Look — I didn't take you from the Zhang Family to make you owe me anything, nor to do anything to you. My matter with the Zhang Family was only because of your great-grandfather Zhang Gaoxuan's arrangement, so now I'm clear with the Zhang Family; no one owes anyone anything."

"Sir has shown the Zhang Family great kindness; Ruoxi will remember it and will work to repay you for the rest of her life!" Zhang Ruoxi said softly, her voice light but her resolve firm.

Yang Kai nodded, "Think as you will. I tell you this because I might need your help in the future."

Zhang Ruoxi kept her head lowered, "If Sir has orders, Ruoxi will endeavor to do them well. Since Sir took me from the Zhang Family, I am no longer of the Zhang Family; whatever Sir asks, I will do it, so long as it pleases you."

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, feeling as though he was speaking to a wall, and finally said helplessly, "Don't call me 'Sir' any more, and don't call yourself 'servant.' I'm a bit older than you — from now on call me Eldest Brother Yang."

"How could I?" Zhang Ruoxi looked up and waved her hands, seeing Yang Kai looking at her and quickly bowing her head again, "That absolutely won't do; your servant cannot be disrespectful to Sir!"

Yang Kai was amused, "You and that head of yours..."

Zhang Ruoxi's face flashed with panic; thinking he was really angry, she hurriedly rose to kneel.

Yang Kai reached out and brushed his hand, causing her to fall back into her seat.

"Forget it — I won't fuss with you over that. Since you're with me now, I'll have need of you at times and I won't mistreat you. First, take this." He produced a jade bottle from a Spatial Ring, opened it, and poured out a single Spiritual Pill bearing pill patterns.

"What is it?" Zhang Ruoxi asked, curious as she examined it.

"A poison — do you dare to take it?" Yang Kai said with a straight face; after saying it he realized his streak of dark humor and felt some contempt for himself.

Zhang Ruoxi pursed her lips and smiled, "You're deceiving me."

Yang Kai looked a little embarrassed and did not explain much, instead saying, "Take this pill and then find a bedroom to cultivate properly. I'll be leaving for a few days; stay here quietly and don't wander about."

"Sir is going out again?" Zhang Ruoxi looked up at Yang Kai, pursed her lips, and asked, "Should your servant accompany you?"

"No need, just take care of yourself," Yang Kai said as he rose, smiled faintly, and went straight to his usual cultivation room.

After Yang Kai left, Zhang Ruoxi examined the Spiritual Pill again; seeing nothing definite, she pinched it to her nose and inhaled — a clear fragrance hit her face, and her eyes flickered; for reasons she couldn't explain her cheeks flushed and she put the pill into her mouth.

The Spiritual Pill dissolved in her stomach, immediately turning into a hot current that rushed through her limbs and bones.

Zhang Ruoxi's expression changed; she did not delay, hurried into the smallest bedroom, sat cross-legged, and silently circulated her profound arts.

The pill she had taken was the Marrow Cleansing Pill Yang Kai had spent several hundred thousand Source Crystals to obtain; with this pill's help, before she reached the Void King Realm her innate aptitude would improve significantly and the time needed for cultivation would be greatly reduced.

Though young, the little maid's experience was considerable; she naturally knew a patterned Spiritual Pill was valuable — even if the entire Zhang Family pooled their resources, they might not obtain such a pill.

In her heart she was deeply grateful to Yang Kai for his generosity.

Elsewhere in the room, after seeing Zhang Ruoxi take the Marrow Cleansing Pill and begin meditating, Yang Kai waved his hand and activated all the room's wards.

He then took out nearly ten Spatial Rings and began sorting this haul.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai gazed with delight at the neatly categorized array before him.

From these nearly ten Spatial Rings, the Source Crystals alone amounted to over eight million, and most of that belonged to Han Leng — almost six million in total.

Thinking back, at the auction Han Leng had bid more than six million to contend with Ning Yuancheng over Liu Yan; if he hadn't had that many Source Crystals, he wouldn't have risked opening his mouth.

Such a vast number of Source Crystals made Yang Kai ecstatic.

Previously he had painstakingly accumulated only a million Source Crystals and had spent several hundred thousand at the auction; now, all of a sudden, he'd come into over eight million.

It seemed that for a very long time to come Yang Kai would not need to worry about Source Crystals.

Besides the large sum of Source Crystals, there were some pills and the like, though those meant little to Yang Kai — as an alchemist he looked down on many of them — but he could sell them.

He had also acquired several Secret Treasures; aside from the exquisite tower ship still lying in the Small Xuan Realm, he had procured three Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasures.

One of them was the long sword Han Leng had used; although it was only Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level, it still pleased Yang Kai.

Another was an armor once owned by Ning Yuancheng; that armor's material was unknown and it too was Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level, but as a defensive Secret Treasure its value was naturally higher than the sword.

The third was the Ink Jade Cauldron Han Leng had previously bid on — a Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemical furnace with many wondrous functions; Han Leng had spent vast sums to obtain it and likely wouldn't have imagined it would soon fall into Yang Kai's hands so easily.

Besides those three Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasures, the others were Void King-Grade Secret Treasures, which together were also of considerable value.

There were also materials: herbs for alchemy and ores for refining implements, all neatly arranged by Yang Kai.

Of all these things, the item that occupied Yang Kai's attention most was a token-like piece.

If Yang Kai recalled correctly, it had been taken from Han Leng's Spatial Ring.

The token was only palm-sized, gleaming gold; on the front a lifelike dragon reared its head and swung its tail, while on the back the character "dragon" had been inscribed in ancient script in a flowing, calligraphic style.

Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense and used his own power to examine the token, but he could not determine its material, and searching his memory he could not discover what the token was for.

But since a powerful expert like Han Leng had treasured it and kept it in a Spatial Ring, the token's origins were probably extraordinary.

Yang Kai decisively tossed it into the Xuan Realm Pearl to study at leisure later.

He then packed away the pills and Secret Treasures, sent out his Divine Sense and felt that Zhang Ruoxi was improving well under the Marrow Cleansing Pill, and so he rose with measured calm.

Half a day later, in Fenglin City's black market, Yang Kai sold many of the spoils he'd recently amassed.

Fenglin City's black market accepted any goods and buyers did not inquire about origins; although the prices were considerably lower than elsewhere, the trade was safe and discreet.

Yang Kai did not sell everything in one shop but distributed the goods among several to avoid attracting notice.

Throughout the process he disguised himself and used his Divine Sense to mask his appearance, confident that the local fighters in Fenglin City would not see through his true face.

When Yang Kai returned from the black market, his Source Crystal holdings had surpassed the ten million mark and he had suddenly become wealthy.
