## Chapter 508 — I Am Also Doing This for Your Own Good

Such a vast Lingxiao Pavilion, although merely a second-rate Sect, still boasted several thousand disciples. Yet after the last sect calamity, only just over a hundred loyal disciples remained.

Though many still lingered within Lingxiao Pavilion, their devotion and attachment to the sect was clearly not comparable to those disciples here.

These few were the foundation for Lingxiao Pavilion’s revival, and absolutely must not suffer any more damage!

News of the possible imminent battle quickly spread. While many disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion were taken aback, none showed fear. On the contrary, people like Su Mu even appeared eager.

After more than a year of hiding from the storm, of dodging peril, they had grown tired of living in constant fear. Now under Yang Kai’s protection, they no longer feared anything and instead bore a reckless sense of bravado, unaware of the true nature of the enemy they would face.

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed deeply. Yang Zhao would send people to intercept them—this was completely unexpected.

If the other side dared to act so boldly, they must be confident, at least confident in being able to stall Ying Jiu! This meant their forces included top-tier Divine Roaming Realm masters. Yet with such a large-scale mobilization, they could not have concealed the spies Qiu Yimeng placed! Perhaps his own forces were already rushing towards this place.

Thinking this brought Yang Kai some relief.

Furthermore, this was not a dead-end! They must have underestimated Ying Jiu’s true strength. Having reached the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, his combat ability was far greater than before.

They were also unaware of Yang Kai’s true power, and did not account for the variable that was Su Yan.

If the forces Yang Zhao dispatched were calculated based on past conditions, then this might actually be an opportunity! But soon Yang Kai realized he had underestimated Yang Zhao’s wariness of him.

Suddenly, a dense mass of figures appeared ahead. Yang Kai’s Divine Sense scanned the crowd and he could not help but smile wryly.

The other side had at least mobilized seven factions! Of these, Yang Kai recognized four: the Qiu Family and Kang Family from Zhongdu; and the Xiang Family and Nan Family, both first-rate forces. They were well-armed and determined to capture him.

The multitude shocked the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples. They never expected such a grand display from the enemy.

A few of the senior uncles and aunts looked horrified, instantly realizing just how important Yang Kai was to the enemy. To capture him, they were willing to send out so many top experts.

On the desolate wilderness, two groups stood facing each other, a hundred zhang apart, staring in mutual hatred.

Two pairs of eyes shot venomous glares. Following those gazes, Yang Kai smirked coldly at Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng.

Qiu Ziru’s expression was complex as he stared blankly at the fearless Yang Kai, unsure what to think; Kang Zhan appeared indifferent.

Many of the others whispered and pointed at Su Yan. Such a serene aura, likened to celestial pearls or dewdrops, naturally drew attention. Whether male or female, young or old, all felt unworthy in her presence—even the two young masters of Zhongdu felt this way.

They had seen beauties before, and in their status, any number could be had. But Su Yan’s elegance made them feel they could never hope to reach her level.

By contrast, Yang Kai standing beside her presented a perfect pairing of talent and beauty.

This thought caused Qiu Ziru and Kang Zhan’s faces to darken—they did not think themselves any less than Yang Kai.

Clearing his throat, Kang Zhan cupped his fist and called out loudly, “Ninth Young Master, long time no see!”

“Brother Kang!” Yang Kai nodded slightly, calm and composed. “Is my Second Brother not here?”

“Second Young Master is busy with noble affairs. This time it is just Elder Brother Qiu and me to receive the Ninth Young Master. Please forgive the inconvenience!” Kang Zhan replied.

Yang Kai sneered and stepped forward arrogantly: “If my Second Brother doesn’t come himself, does that mean he sent you two as cannon fodder?”

Kang Zhan’s expression darkened. “Ninth Young Master, in consideration of our acquaintance, there’s no need to speak so harshly.”

“What acquaintance do I have with you two?” Yang Kai tilted his head, smiling lightly. “I must have forgotten.”

Yang Kai had almost no social ties with Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru. He had only once drunk with Kang Zhan shortly after arriving in Zhongdu at Yang Zhao’s summons, which ended on bad terms. He had never even spoken with Qiu Ziru.

Kang Zhan inhaled sharply and shouted, “Since you say so, then I shall waste no words. We truly have no ties; let our combat speak for itself. If offenses occur, you can blame your bad luck, Ninth Young Master!”

“Mutual feelings, then,” replied Yang Kai.

Kang Zhan continued to bark orders: “Before departure, Second Young Master instructed us that if you wished to surrender, Ninth Young Master, we should not give you trouble in order to maintain your brotherly ties. So I have to ask, will you accept Second Young Master’s goodwill?”

Yang Kai shook his head laughing: “You know the answer; no need to ask.”

“Good!” Kang Zhan nodded firmly.

“Why waste words on him? I will send Nan Family’s experts to hold off Ying Jiu while the rest rush forward to capture him,” Nan Sheng’s eyes blazed with fury. He plainly wished he could defeat Yang Kai now, to vent the anger of these past years by humiliating him.

Kang Zhan frowned slightly but said nothing. He understood Nan Sheng’s grudges against Yang Kai and shared his intentions.

Though Yang Kai had brought many people, very few were Divine Roaming Realm masters. The Lingxiao Pavilion people were simply beneath Kang Zhan’s notice.

Just as Kang Zhan was about to order his troops forward, Yang Kai’s voice rang out: “Brother Kang, let’s make a deal.”

“What is it?” Kang Zhan frowned.

“In this battle, only Ying Jiu and I will fight. If you defeat us, you will have achieved a great merit before my Second Brother!”

Upon hearing this, Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru were briefly stunned, unable to believe Yang Kai did not intend to deploy his hundred-plus followers.

Those hundreds, though ignored by Kang Zhan, could still inflict some damage if they truly fought.

Hearing Yang Kai’s proposal, Kang Zhan immediately suspected trickery, his expression wavering.

Meanwhile, the senior uncles and aunts of Lingxiao Pavilion stood excited, insisting on contributing even if it meant death, their resolve fierce.

“You cannot have losses,” Yang Kai shook his head, refusing their offer gravely. “I am from the Yang Family. They dare not kill me. If I can’t win, I can flee. But if you suffer casualties, how can I explain to my seniors?”

“The Senior Aunt may stand aside, but I will fight!” Su Yan’s gaze fixed firmly on Yang Kai, her eyes unwavering.

Yang Kai considered her for a moment and nodded. Her strength was comparable to his, not to be underestimated. As they cultivated as partners, fighting side by side might yield unexpected results.

Su Yan smiled softly...

“Brother Kang, I have changed my mind. There will be three of us fighting: Ying Jiu, myself, and Senior Sister Su Yan!” Yang Kai casually shouted across. “Defeat us, and I will withdraw from the Succession War!”

Kang Zhan had been guessing at Yang Kai’s intentions but his expression shifted oddly at this. He began to believe Yang Kai’s words might be genuine, not some ploy.

“Looks like those people are very important to Yang Kai, so he is going to such lengths to protect them,” Nan Sheng sneered, his aura growing dangerous like a cold venomous snake eyeing the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples.

Xiang Chu laughed coldly beside him.

Kang Zhan scowled and asked, “Ninth Young Master, can you tell me why?”

“No reason,” Yang Kai shook his head slowly. “Those people are my sect’s elder uncles, aunts, and brothers and sisters. If they suffer harm, I fear I won’t be able to control myself. If I were to kill in a frenzy, causing Kang Family and Qiu Family to lose their men, I would have no excuse.”

“Demon Sect Lingxiao Pavilion’s people?” Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru’s faces changed. They suddenly realized where the hundred-plus disciples were from and showed some apprehension.

Lingxiao Pavilion was no ordinary second-rate Sect—it had produced an Evil Lord!

“This proposal benefits both you and me. Brother Kang, think it over carefully,” Yang Kai urged.

“Brother Kang, don’t agree to him!” Nan Sheng licked his lips, staring grimly. “They are the Evil Sect’s followers—anyone can kill them. Who knows if one of them might become another Evil Lord tomorrow? Killing them all now prevents future trouble!”

“I agree!” Xiang Chu nodded.

Kang Zhan glanced at them coldly, snorting, knowing their desire for vengeance. Yang Kai had made his position clear, yet they chose to defy his boundaries, clearly wishing him suffering to settle old scores.

Qiu Ziru, however, shook his head and said, “Brother Kang, I see no harm in agreeing. The advantage is entirely ours, and at the right moment we can sell him a favor. I doubt Second Young Master would wish to push matters to the extreme.”

To Qiu Ziru, capturing Yang Kai was certain, a foregone conclusion.

There was no need to truly provoke him.

Killing Lingxiao Pavilion’s hundred-plus would do nothing for the Succession War, only ensure Yang Kai held grudges against them.

Qiu Ziru did not want to become a target of Yang Kai’s wrath—a man known for his lawlessness.

Hearing this, Kang Zhan nodded lightly: “Brother Qiu’s words make sense.”

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu exchanged looks of frustration. Here was a perfect chance for revenge against Yang Kai, yet they had no say. Naturally, they were displeased.

“Ninth Young Master, I agree!” Kang Zhan shouted back. “None of your sect members will be harmed in this battle—provided they stay out of the fight. Otherwise, casualties are on their own heads!”

“Of course!” Yang Kai drew a breath and smiled. “Actually, I am also doing this for your own good.”
