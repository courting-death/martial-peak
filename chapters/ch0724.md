## Chapter 724 — A Bright Turn in the Gloom

From that direction a sharp, cutting presence surged up; it was plain an expert was speeding this way.

The Cheng Family in Shuilan City counted as a local force, and naturally the clan contained experts of the Transcendent Realm. Sensing the battle fluctuations near the garden, they immediately rushed over to see.

Before they arrived a harsh shout already carried: "Who dares run wild in my Cheng Family?"

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and stood where he was, waiting calmly, showing no intention of fleeing.

The newcomers possessed cultivation at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm, on par with Yang Kai now. Though there were two of them, Yang Kai showed no fear.

In same-level combat, no one could defeat him.

After a moment, two elders descended simultaneously from left and right. One wore an earth-yellow robe, the other a pale-blue robe. When they saw the garden's bloody scene their expressions stiffened.

Yang Kai frowned, for he noticed both elders were maimed—one missing an arm, the other missing a left leg—and in the places of that arm and left leg unknown Secret Treasures had been fitted. They looked lifelike, yet radiated a metallic chill.

"Kid, did you kill these people?" the yellow-robed elder roared, eyes full of mortal hatred.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, offering no denial.

"Why would you slaughter my Cheng Family people? What grievance have we done to you?" the blue-robed elder shouted in fury.

"No grievance, nor hatred!" Yang Kai replied.

"Then why spill their blood? Do you take the Cheng Family for something to be bullied?" As he spoke, both elders condensed their True Yuan, clearly preparing to act and avenge the dead.

Yang Kai's calm composure told them he had certain skill, and when their Divine Sense probing returned like a bottomless pit with no clue to be found, they grew uneasy—what background did this youth have, so young yet so unfathomable?

"If you do not give us an explanation now, the Cheng Family will be sworn enemies with you!" the yellow-robed elder shouted, face flushed.

"Sworn enemies?" Yang Kai sneered low. "Fine—fight first, talk later. I have things to ask you!"

The dead youth did not know where Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang had gone, but these two elders might.

As he spoke, scorching Divine Sense suddenly burst forth, carrying an intent to burn everything, and without form it slammed toward the two elders.

The elders were not young and had trained long; the defenses of their Sea of Consciousness were naturally not fragile, and they also wore Divine Soul Secret Treasures for protection.

Only when their Divine Soul Secret Treasures flashed did they react, sensing that searing aura and their faces changing drastically with nameless terror.

Under Elder Li's instruction, Yang Kai had gained some understanding of employing Divine Sense Fire.

Divine Sense Fire was not only exceedingly useful in alchemy, but effective in combat as well.

This was his first battle after rising to the Transcendent Realm, and his opponents were two warriors of equal rank, so he certainly intended to properly test his current strength.

Thus he struck without pity.

What surprised him was how fragile the two were; the defenses of their Sea of Consciousness were torn apart with ease. If not for those two defensive Secret Treasures, a single blow from Yang Kai could have burned their souls away.

Even so, the two elders broke into a cold sweat and deployed means to guard their bodies.

Yang Kai retracted his Divine Sense Fire and, his figure like lightning, darted before them.

Two thunderous palms sent the elders flying like kites; they spat blood continuously in midair.

They crashed to the ground and had yet to rise when Yang Kai's figure already filled their vision like an inaccessible mountain, blotting out the sky and plunging their sight into darkness.

They had no strength left to resist!

The two elders could not accept such a result.

Yang Kai himself felt a bit displeased; he thought testing himself against same-level warriors might have been a mistake.

A dangerous aura pressed down on the two elders, keeping them from daring to move. Lying there, a chill rose in their hearts and their spirits fell into a bottomless, pitch-black abyss.

"Who in the heaven's name are you?" the yellow-robed elder still kept up a show of toughness, swallowing his fear to probe Yang Kai's origins.

Yang Kai shook his head. "You need not know who I am. I'll ask you questions—answer me to my satisfaction and I'll spare you. If you do not satisfy me, heh... your Cheng Family will be exterminated here today!"

Those cold, remorseless words made them quake; they hastily nodded repeatedly. From the way Yang Kai had dealt with them, they believed he truly had the power to annihilate the Cheng Family.

"Two years ago did your Cheng Family receive an old man and a veiled woman?" Yang Kai asked, staring into their eyes.

At this the two elders' faces went deathly pale as if recalling something terrifying; panic filled their eyes.

The yellow-robed elder said, "So you were connected to them! Young brother, our family's rebellious son did wrong and paid the price; even the two of us were punished. Two years on, why press for annihilation?"

The blue-robed elder hastily nodded, "Our Cheng Family has been taught a lesson—surely this matter is finished?"

Yang Kai frowned; he realized they had misunderstood his intent.

His gaze flickered. "Was your hand and leg severed by that old man?"

Both nodded, faces full of lingering dread, reluctant to recall the events from two years past.

Yang Kai split a grin; his resentment toward Shopkeeper Meng eased considerably.

Someone had dared drug Xia Ningshang; knowing Meng Wuya's character, he would never have merely broken two legs—so it seemed the Cheng Family's two Transcendent Realm elders had indeed been punished.

The yellow-robed elder began, "That senior apparently had some acquaintance with one of our ancestors. He came to Shuilan City and stayed at our Cheng Family as a guest for several days; we treated him courteously, yet our rebellious son made a move on his disciple and slipped poison into her food. The senior flew into rage and struck back. If not for an elder from the Water Divine Hall intervening, our Cheng Family would likely have been wiped out. Even so, we paid a heavy price. In the end that senior, out of past ties with our ancestor, spared our lives."

"Water Divine Hall?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened. "You said Water Divine Hall?"

"What's wrong?" the yellow-robed elder looked confused, not understanding Yang Kai's sudden excitement.

"Did that elder and the veiled woman go to the Water Divine Hall?" Yang Kai pressed urgently.

"They should have, because it was an elder of the Water Divine Hall who led them to Shuilan City, and this city lies within the Water Divine Hall's territory. Our Cheng Family is one of the forces beholden to the Water Divine Hall."

Yang Kai slapped his forehead and stood dazed, his expression changing constantly; the two elders watched in alarm.

After a long moment, Yang Kai suddenly laughed aloud, "So that's it!"

In that instant everything fell into place.

Truly, when the cart reached the mountain and the road seemed to end, a bright turn in the willows revealed another village!

"Young brother, you..." the yellow-robed elder asked with trembling, afraid Yang Kai might in anger truly wipe out the Cheng Family.

"This no longer concerns you. Since that old fellow spared you, your ancestor must have had deep ties with him; I won't overstep. But... I did slaughter many of your men, and there was also someone who looked like a Young Master. How do you explain that?"

"That rebellious son deserved death!" the yellow-robed elder snorted coldly. "If not for his own blindness, how would the two of us have fallen to this state?"

His face filled with a violent aura; he was plainly still furious.

"Fine." Yang Kai inclined his head and let go of the idea of obliterating them, saying coolly, "Where is the Water Divine Hall? Point the way."

"That way, out in that endless sea; the islands there are the Water Divine Hall's foundation," the yellow-robed elder hurriedly pointed in a direction.

No sooner had he finished speaking than Yang Kai streaked off like lightning, vanishing in an instant.

After waiting a long time and seeing Yang Kai had gone far, the two elders glanced at one another and slowly climbed to their feet, faces alternating between green and red.

To be easily felled by a green youth was shameful; luckily no one had seen it, otherwise they might have silenced witnesses.

Wretched misfortune!

Beyond Shuilan City, Yang Kai sped forward in haste, utterly disregarding True Yuan consumption.

The Water Divine Hall was the sect where Shui Ling belonged.

It had been nearly three years since Shui Ling and he had come to Tongxuan Continent via a Void Passage through the Wasteland. When they parted at Duao City, Shui Ling had invited him to the Water Divine Hall, but Yang Kai had refused.

He now regretted that refusal.

Yang Kai was certain Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang had gone to the Water Divine Hall to seek Shui Ling; perhaps Shopkeeper Meng had left some clue for Shui Ling to pass on.

After all, in Zhongdu Meng Wuya had already learned of Shui Ling's origin, and he likely guessed that if he arrived here and could not find his trail, he would head to the Water Divine Hall.

That was Yang Kai's deduction, and it was very likely true.

The Cheng Family elders' words had confirmed this for him.

It had been an elder of the Water Divine Hall who had led Meng Wuya to Shuilan City, so Meng Wuya must have visited the Water Divine Hall before and met Shui Ling.

Having seen Shui Ling meant Meng Wuya surely knew he had arrived on Tongxuan Continent.

Burning with urgency, Yang Kai streaked across the sea like lightning, the gust he raised seeming to split the ocean in two.

After a day and a night, distant outlines of islands appeared—scattered, irregular, like stars strewn across the heavens.

The islands varied in size; some were only ten-odd li across, while others occupied several hundred or even a thousand li.

Yang Kai's spirit jolted; he knew this was surely the region where the Water Divine Hall was located.

Near the islands the sea was busy with ships ferrying supplies to the Water Divine Hall—an impressive, grand scene that displayed the Water Divine Hall's extraordinary power.
