## Chapter 625 — Gold Devouring Beast

Yang Kai immediately noticed a layer of barrier-like presence had formed around them.

He knew Sun Ying must have activated the restriction array laid the previous night to prevent any escapees.

Yang Kai frowned, a vague sense of unease stirring within him.

"Go in!" Sun Ying waved his hand and strode ahead; the others followed in single file.

The mine shaft ran deep; the tunnels, carved out over years of mining, wound and branched in countless directions.

Along the way, the passageway sides bore traces of being gnawed; the exposed Ri Xi ore had all vanished, surely devoured clean by those Gold Devouring Beasts.

These Demonic Beasts fed on minerals; having eaten through the outskirts, they had penetrated into the interior, some several li from the entrance, and were scattered about—making it convenient for the Duao Alliance folk to capture them one by one.

After walking not far, a fork in the tunnel appeared ahead.

Sun Ying took a moment to sense the surroundings, then instructed, "Miss Yun, your squad has the most members—take this branch. With your strength you should be able to handle it. Xinyu's team is smaller; I need to stay with them. If anything unforeseen happens or you run into trouble you can't handle, signal us and I will rush to assist at once."

Yun Xuan nodded solemnly, leading her squad and Yang Kai into the left passage.

"Miss Yun, be careful," Zhou Luo murmured with a face full of tender sentiment.

Receiving no reply—Yun Xuan seemed not to have heard—Ruan Xinyu snorted and looked at Zhou Luo with contempt, huffing, "Save your breath."

"All right, we'll go in too." Sun Ying, well aware of the romantic entanglements among these young men and women and unwilling to pry, waved and led the others down the other branch.

After following Yun Xuan for a short distance, Yang Kai quickened his pace to fall in beside her and quietly asked, "That elder who activated the array in advance—could that cause problems?"

"What kind of problem?" Yun Xuan looked at him in surprise.

"If the restriction isn't lifted by him, the Gold Devouring Beasts can't leave, and you all can't get out either, right?"

"We're here to capture Gold Devouring Beasts—why would we want to leave?" Yun Xuan frowned, then suddenly understood: "You're worried something dangerous might happen?"

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Yun Xuan smiled wryly. "You worry too much. Xinyu's group has been scouting here for days, and Uncle Sun personally investigated this place—of course he'd be certain it was safe before activating the restriction early. If we really encounter trouble we can't handle, Uncle Sun will come to help."

Hearing her say that, Yang Kai had no more objections; he gave a slight nod and fell silent.

Yun Xuan glanced at him and added softly, "Being cautious is fine, but a man's courage should be a bit bolder; only then can he accomplish things."

To avoid speaking loudly and alerting the Gold Devouring Beasts, Yun Xuan lowered her voice and leaned close to Yang Kai's ear.

A faint, intoxicating scent drifted into his nostrils; Yang Kai's expression stiffened.

Yun Xuan was surprised and flushed slightly, whispering like incense, "Stay behind me. If I don't let you move, don't move."

Yang Kai smiled inwardly at himself, thinking this girl really did take him for an inexperienced youth. He may look young, but the things he'd been through in recent years were countless.

"Captain!" At that moment the bearded man suddenly barked, and the seven or eight members of the squad halted in their tracks, holding their breath and fixing their gaze on a corner up ahead.

From that corner came the sound of chewing; when Divine Sense was extended, a life aura could clearly be felt.

"One." Yun Xuan's face brightened. "Not bad luck."

"Heh heh!" Ji Hong let out a strange chuckle, rubbing his hands together; the other team members likewise looked excited.

Under everyone's watchful eyes, Yun Xuan quickly signaled a few hand signs; the team understood and nodded, then one by one slipped forward.

Subtle ripples of energy drifted out. Yang Kai saw two martial artists setting something on the ground—apparently setting a trap—while the others stood guard around them to prevent any noise from alerting the Gold Devouring Beast.

Before long, the preparations were complete.

Ji Hong looked back at Yun Xuan.

Yun Xuan nodded solemnly.

Ji Hong's face contorted into a feral grin; he licked his lips and suddenly produced a two-handed great axe one zhang long. The moment the axe appeared, a chilling killing intent and a scent of blood burst forth.

Ji Hong leapt forward, gripping the great axe with both hands, making a show of bravado as he charged ahead.

The gnawing suddenly stopped. Yang Kai could clearly sense the life aura at that corner shift into something dangerous.

Ji Hong's provocation had undoubtedly maddened the Gold Devouring Beast.

Thud, thud, thud… the ground trembled, increasingly violent. Suddenly from the corner emerged a head topped with twin horns, its skull glimmering silver; golden light erupted between those silver horns, quite powerful, the energy fluctuations intense.

Gold Devouring Beast!

It was Yang Kai's first time seeing this kind of Demonic Beast. Upon closer inspection he found it was only about two zhang long, roughly human height, somewhat rotund—like an enlarged fat worm—its fat belly swaying from side to side as it ran. Despite its bulk, it moved swiftly.

What concerned Yang Kai more was the crisscrossing, trench-like plates covering its body; those carapace plates looked supremely solid and were not easy to break.

These plates wrapped its entire back and tail like a tortoise shell, leaving only the belly pressed close to the ground as a weakness.

Only when the Gold Devouring Beast had come within three zhang did Ji Hong turn and run back.

He had never intended to engage such a thick-skinned Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast head-on.

"Here it comes!" Ji Hong shouted as he ran, excitement shining on his face; the others were equally thrilled and looked forward with bated breath.

Passing over the previously set trap, Ji Hong leaped across, but the Sixth-Tier Gold Devouring Beast, ignorant of the trick, simply barreled straight over it with its bloated body.

The prepared martial artists needed no order from Yun Xuan; they activated the secret treasures embedded in the trap.

Brilliant light exploded from the earth as rope-like energies shot out, wrapping and binding the Gold Devouring Beast.

Its clumsy limbs were quickly bound, and the beast's vast bulk, driven by inertia, was flung forward more than ten zhang before slowly coming to rest, gouging a trench-like scar in the ground.

"Destroy its horns!" Yun Xuan shouted, springing into action; a force impossible to ignore burst from her slender form as she rushed to the Gold Devouring Beast.

The other martial artists surged forward in turn.

The golden radiance between the Gold Devouring Beast's horns writhed through the mine like a viper, but as a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast it was only on par with human practitioners of the Divine Roaming Realm; its attacks failed to inflict any real harm on Yun Xuan and the others.

Within little more than a dozen breaths, Ji Hong had hacked off the Gold Devouring Beast's extraordinarily hard horns with his great axe.

In obvious unbearable pain, the Gold Devouring Beast wailed.

Yun Xuan's pretty face changed; she quickly bound the creature's mouth.

"Captain!" Ji Hong laughed and presented the severed horns to Yun Xuan like a tribute. Yun Xuan nodded slightly and slipped them into her Spatial Pouch.

Because of its physiology and mineral diet, the Gold Devouring Beast's horns and carapace plates were excellent materials for forging. "That was easy," Ji Hong boasted, shaking his head with pride.

"A Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast isn't especially intelligent. With our traps it was easy to capture. But in a straight fight you'd notice how troublesome it is: its plates are very hard, the energy released between its horns is not weak, and its ramming force is terrifying. Ordinary Divine Roaming Realm practitioners are no match. In this mine, where our maneuvering is hindered, it can unleash its full power. Do not underestimate it," Yun Xuan warned sternly, to prevent Ji Hong's overconfidence from causing unnecessary loss.

"Got it." Ji Hong nodded heavily.

Yun Xuan pursed her lips and smiled. "All right, move on. Leave this one here; we'll figure out how to transport it back to Duao City when we return."

Everyone was high-spirited and full of vigor.

Pushing further inward for half a day, using the same methods, Yun Xuan's squad easily captured three Gold Devouring Beasts.

Throughout that half day, Yang Kai had not acted.

It was not because of Yun Xuan's earlier admonition; rather, with Yun Xuan's team's methods more than sufficient to capture the Gold Devouring Beasts, there was no need for him to interfere.

He had come this time mainly to repay Yun Xuan a favor. If the rewards or opportunities he obtained here could not be considered repayment, he would simply find another way—he would not force the matter.

Yet Yang Kai had been watching secretly for some time and knew they could not continue capturing Gold Devouring Beasts this way forever.

For one, they had a limited number of secret treasures for setting traps; for another, not every Gold Devouring Beast existed alone.

Ahead, two Gold Devouring Beasts' life auras were very close; alarming one would surely alert the other.

Indeed, after Ji Hong returned with news, he reported the situation to Yun Xuan, whose delicate brows knitted in concern.

"How many Beast-Binding Rings are left?" Yun Xuan asked, looking at someone.

"Three."

"Set them all," Yun Xuan decided after a moment's thought.

"Right." The man nodded and, with another martial artist, carefully placed the three Beast-Binding Rings in the passage.

With all preparations complete, Ji Hong once again baited them out. After a bout of provocation, the two Gold Devouring Beasts indeed took the bait and charged fiercely.

Passing the first trap, the Beast-Binding Ring flared to life but failed to work as before.

The two Gold Devouring Beasts' collision force tore through the Ring's restraints, surging onward like a torrent.

The second trap only slightly slowed them; only at the third trap did they manage to capture one.

The remaining beast still charged toward Yun Xuan.

"Attack!" Yun Xuan showed no panic, as if everything had been expected. At her command, the hidden martial artists on either side suddenly struck, unleashing the brilliance of their Martial Skills and Secret Treasures.
