## Chapter 1016 — Compromise

“You need something from me—naturally, you wouldn’t strike me,” Yang Kai snorted lightly.

"If that weren't the case, do you think I'd go easy on you?" the Ghost Ancestor sneered coldly. "No need for idle chatter. I didn't know you were versed in the laws of space before, but it's not too late to learn. You cooperate with me and help find a way out of here — how about that?"

"How do we cooperate?" Yang Kai frowned.

"I'll give you freedom. Whatever you want, I'll give it to you — I'll make sure you're satisfied! You seek a way to leave this place, but when the time comes to go, you must bring me with you." The Ghost Ancestor chuckled darkly. "The spatial formation I painstakingly devised probably won't do much, but since you also study spatial laws, there might be a way together!"

"I don't trust you!" Yang Kai shook his head. Dealing with a creature like this, one misstep could mean endless calamity.

"Then what would make you trust me?"

"Swear an oath!"

The Ghost Ancestor's expression twisted; he grinned fiercely. "You trust my oath? I can break it anytime!"

"Swear by your dead wife and children, and I'll believe you!" Yang Kai said earnestly.

"Kid, don't be greedy!" The Ghost Ancestor's face suddenly took on a violent look, as if Yang Kai had struck a raw nerve. He barked, "It does you no good to anger me. I can kill you right now and use soul-searching to extract your research into spatial laws!"

"The odds of success are low. You might get my notes on spatial laws, or you might get nothing, and even if you do get them you might not comprehend them — such things depend on aptitude. That's also why you've studied for a thousand years with little result; your comprehension of space is sorely lacking!" Yang Kai spoke bluntly, not afraid of enraging the Ghost Ancestor.

He stared hard at Ghost Ancestor. “Do you dare take a gamble?”

The Ghost Ancestor's expression wavered; his predatory gaze fixed on Yang Kai, as if he wanted to kill him and sift through his memories. Yet the flicker in his eyes held hesitation.

Yang Kai's words struck true, leaving him indecisive.

"If you won't swear by your dead wife and children, I'll dive into that spatial fissure now and never come out. I'd rather die in there than work with you. When I'm gone, you can tinker with your formation and hope it works." Saying that, Yang Kai meant what he said and began to crawl into the spatial rift.

"Wait!" the Ghost Ancestor thundered, his face twitching, a dense, chilling aura surging forth.

Suddenly he laughed and inclined his head. "Kid, you've got guts, daring to bargain with me like that."

Yang Kai shrugged. "Collaborating with you is like negotiating with a tiger; I have to be cautious."

"Fine, you win! I'll swear by my wife and children. As long as you cooperate, I won't lay a hand on you. If I break this oath, may heaven strike me down and I meet a wretched end!"

Yang Kai shook his head.

"What more do you want?" the Ghost Ancestor demanded.

"Not 'may heaven strike me' or 'meet a wretched end' — such oaths are meaningless. You know how to swear properly, right?"

The Ghost Ancestor stared at him coldly; the hollows of his eyes radiated an ice-deep chill, killing intent swelling like a tide.

He slowly closed his eyes. He didn't play with words; instead, he solemnly swore, invoking his dead wife and children with a vow so vicious it left no room for loopholes.

Only then did Yang Kai climb out of the spatial fissure, saying casually, "Would've been fine to say that sooner."

"Right now I'd like nothing more than to kill you, crush your bones to powder, and scatter your soul into the wind to ease the grudge in my heart." The Ghost Ancestor glared at him with cold fury.

“I believe Senior still cares deeply for his wife and child—otherwise, you wouldn’t be holding onto vengeance even after two thousand years,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile. “Senior is truly a man of deep affection.”

The Ghost Ancestor's ferocity dissolved like frost under the sun, and a flicker of memory crossed his eyes as though he had pictured his family.

"Let the past be the past. Come back with me first; we'll figure this out together and find a way to leave." His tone suddenly calmed as if that one remark had eased his anger.

With that, he waved his sleeve and wrapped Yang Kai up, heading back the way they had come.

On the flat stretch of the mountainside, everyone waited, hearts in their throats; the atmosphere was silent.

Although the Ghost Ancestor had been gone an hour, none of them dared to flee.

This continent was the Ghost Ancestor's territory; they had nowhere to run.

Everyone felt restless and uneasy inside, secretly hoping Ghost Ancestor would never return—best of all, that he’d die somewhere out there.

Just as anxiety churned in their chests, Yue Xi's expression suddenly changed and she cried out, "He seems to be back."

She turned and looked in that direction.

Following her gaze, they saw a mass of black clouds rapidly approaching, the cold aura emanating from within making everyone's skin crawl.

Despair once again wrapped around their hearts.

"Huh?" Shen Tu exclaimed in surprise, staring into the black cloud. He seemed to catch sight of Yang Kai's figure within it and was stunned on the spot.

Others quickly noticed the strange phenomenon and were left gaping.

Yang Kai had clearly been tossed into the Void Passage earlier, yet now he returned accompanied by the Ghost Ancestor—no one could explain this sight.

After a moment the black cloud descended, and the forms of the Ghost Ancestor and Yang Kai appeared before them.

Realizing they hadn't been seeing things, everyone's expressions turned odd, and gazes shifted repeatedly between Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor.

It didn't take long for them to notice that some agreement had evidently been reached between the Ghost Ancestor and Yang Kai; the old monster's attitude toward Yang Kai was markedly different.

"Ask for what you need and say it quickly. Hurry up and work out a method — I don't want to wait any longer," the Ghost Ancestor said indifferently.

"You still have to wait," Yang Kai shook his head. "Thanks to you, the continent's spatial domain is currently chaotic; otherwise I wouldn't have been caught. I could have stayed hidden in the spatial fissure and never come out."

"What's that got to do with me?" the Ghost Ancestor felt somewhat wronged.

"This spatial formation you built..." Yang Kai pointed in that direction.

The Ghost Ancestor's expression grew sheepish and he said nothing.

Though not a master of space, he'd studied it for a thousand years and understood enough to know Yang Kai was right: the formation constantly opened the Void Passage, and the repeated creation of that passage had warped the surrounding space.

"Shut the formation down for a while. Wait until the warped domain stabilizes, then I can begin my research," Yang Kai said.

The Ghost Ancestor did not speak; with a wave of his sleeve the running formation instantly fell silent, and the Void Passage framed by the gate closed in an instant.

"How long must we wait?" the Ghost Ancestor asked anxiously.

"Not sure," Yang Kai shook his head. "Maybe half a month, maybe a few months, maybe years or even decades — who knows."

"You're not using this as an excuse to stall, are you?" the Ghost Ancestor eyed him suspiciously. "Don't forget, I swore an oath, but that was on the condition you cooperate. If you try any tricks, I will show you no mercy."

"What advantage would I gain from stalling? Even if I delay ten years I still wouldn't be your match!" Yang Kai snorted.

"Good, you're sensible!" the Ghost Ancestor was satisfied. "Fine, so be it for now. Live here for the time being — I've opened a dwelling over there. The Spiritual Qi here is the richest on the whole continent; you can cultivate here for a while and I guarantee you'll be reluctant to leave. If you need anything else, tell me at any time."

At his command, his figure flickered and he disappeared.

He cared nothing for what Lü Guichen and Yue Xi thought.

After he left, Shen Tu walked over to Yang Kai and exclaimed, "Yang Kai, what's going on? You and that elder seem to be getting along well... How did you get out of the Void Passage?"

He was completely baffled, bewilderment written across his face.

The others were the same, their gazes all trained on Yang Kai, expecting an explanation.

"He needed something from me, so we made an agreement," Yang Kai replied casually.

"Needed something from you?" Shen Tu was shocked.

"What could you possibly have that would make such a figure seek you out?" Yue Xi frowned, disbelief on her face.

Yang Kai shot her a glance and couldn't be bothered to answer.

"Young brother..." Lü Guichen cleared his throat, smiling widely now and addressing Yang Kai more warmly. "May I ask, does this mean we're safe for the moment? That elder won't let us enter the Void Passage to probe things anymore?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded. "You won't be going into the Void Passage again."

He Miao's eyes lit up; she couldn't help the joyous relief of having narrowly escaped death.

"Whether you're truly safe, I can't say!" Yang Kai smiled faintly and cast Lü Guichen a mischievous look.

Lü Guichen's face changed; he suddenly recalled the grudges between him and this youth.

When they first arrived here, it had been Lü who placed the restriction inside Yang's body, depriving him of his strength.

Now that Yang Kai had come to terms with the Ghost Ancestor, his status was clearly different from theirs, the prisoners under surveillance.

With the old monster's protection, Yang Kai could act as he pleased here.

Realizing this, Lü Guichen panicked at the thought of Yang Kai settling scores later. He hurriedly plastered on a smile, cupped his hands, and said, "Young brother, Lü here was blind before and offended you. Please forgive me."

Bi Ya's face had gone pale as well; her watery peach-blossom eyes brimmed with terror. She forced a embarrassed smile and coquettishly said, "Young sir, my previous behavior was wrong. Please be magnanimous and don't hold it against me. From now on I'll follow your orders — ask and I'll do it. I know many skills; I promise I won't disappoint you!"

Her final words carried strong implications; any man could hear what she meant.
