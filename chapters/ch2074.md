## Chapter 2074 — Making a Ruckus

"Brother Kang, something serious has happened," Yang Kai said in a low, cold voice, his face grim.

"What happened?" Kang Siran's expression shifted as he gleaned a clue from Yang Kai's face, and he asked urgently.

"It was like this…" Yang Kai spoke rapidly as he related the strange events that had occurred at the mine, then added, "Brother Kang, please pack your things at once and leave Fenglin City with me!"

"How could this be? How could pure Demonic Qi from an Ancient Great Demon be near Fenglin City?" Kang Siran was dazed, hardly believing his own ears.

Had Yang Kai not come to tell him, he would have laughed it off and refused to take it seriously, but since the news came from Yang Kai himself, he could not help but ponder it.

"There is no time to deliberate," Yang Kai said anxiously, glancing back toward the sky outside the city as if sensing something; his expression shifted slightly as he added in a low voice, "Brother Kang, I will go to the City Lord's Mansion and be right back—once I return we must leave immediately!"

With that he triggered his Spatial Force and blinked through the city.

Kang Siran gave a start and, without thinking further, spun around and dashed into the Spiritual Pill Shop.

In the next moment the entire Spiritual Pill Shop erupted into chaos.

The City Lord's Mansion sat at the very center of Fenglin City, and Yang Kai had been there before with Kang Siran to attend that auction, so he knew the layout well.

He had not gone to the mansion to inform anyone in particular—he had come to find Mo Xiaoqi.

By his reckoning Mo Xiaoqi should have already explained the situation at the mine to the City Lord's people, yet she was nowhere to be seen.

Yang Kai resolved to go himself and bring Mo Xiaoqi back.

Halfway there he pulled out the Sound Bead Mo Xiaoqi had given him, poured his Divine Sense into it, and sent a message.

Unfortunately, Mo Xiaoqi gave no response.

Yang Kai frowned, withdrew the Sound Bead, and quickened his pace.

Shortly thereafter he arrived at the City Lord's Mansion and unleashed a sweeping Divine Sense that immediately located Mo Xiaoqi's trace.

Mo Xiaoqi was in a side hall of the mansion, and with her stood a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator—yet his aura felt unfamiliar; who he was, no one knew.

The Spatial Force dropped and Yang Kai immediately appeared inside that side hall.

Looking over, Yang Kai saw Mo Xiaoqi standing before a gray-faced old man, speaking with excited intensity, while the old man stood with his hands behind his back, blatantly indifferent.

The moment Yang Kai appeared, the old man sensed it. He snapped his head around, and from those calm eyes suddenly shot two sharp beams of light that fell upon Yang Kai—after which a look of surprise flickered across his face.

The old man had noticed that Yang Kai was a Dao Origin Realm cultivator he had never seen before.

Cultivators of the Dao Origin Realm like that were not common in Fenglin City.

"Eldest Brother Yang!" Mo Xiaoqi cried as if she had seen a savior, her face lighting up as she hurried forward.

"Has it been dealt with?" Yang Kai asked hastily.

Mo Xiaoqi, annoyed, jabbed a foot and pointed at the gray-faced old man. "This Deputy City Lord simply does not believe what I said—I'm arguing with him right now."

Yang Kai's brows knit.

Hearing Mo Xiaoqi's words, Yang Kai understood who that gray-faced old man was.

He was Fenglin City's Deputy City Lord, Zhuang Pan, and also a First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

Fenglin City had one City Lord and two Deputy City Lords; the City Lord was Duan Yuanshan, who had reached the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and of the two Deputies one was the eccentric Drunken Old Man who had presided over the auction, while the other was Zhuang Pan.

Although both Deputies were only First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, they had lingered at that realm for many years and could potentially break through at any time.

Perhaps because he was on duty in the mansion today, Mo Xiaoqi had met Zhuang Pan without much trouble upon arriving, but unfortunately Zhuang Pan did not put much stock in her claims; no matter how dire she painted the situation, he remained unconcerned and instead regarded her with a suspicious look, as if doubting she had ulterior motives.

This utterly distressed Mo Xiaoqi.

She had taken it upon herself to come to the City Lord's Mansion to report the leak of Demonic Qi simply out of kindness—she could not bear to see so many cultivators in Fenglin City poisoned by the Demonic Qi. She had no selfish motive, yet Zhuang Pan's attitude made her feel humiliated and deeply wronged.

Facing Yang Kai, Zhuang Pan's expression finally grew somewhat solemn; after all, Yang Kai's cultivation realm was not something he could ignore. "What is your name, friend? You are unfamiliar here," he said.

"Yang Kai, greetings Deputy City Lord Zhuang!" Yang Kai cupped his fist. Before Zhuang Pan could reply he continued, "What my friend reported is not fabricated—I saw it with my own eyes. How the City Lord's Mansion intends to defend against it, I leave to Deputy City Lord Zhuang to discuss with the City Lord; it is urgent, and I must take my leave now!"

Having spoken, Yang Kai did not bother to spare Zhuang Pan any courtesy; he grabbed Mo Xiaoqi and headed for the exit.

Zhuang Pan's face darkened at that.

At that moment a First Stage of the Void King Realm cultivator rushed in from outside in a panic, shouting, "Report to Deputy City Lord—just now a tower ship ignored the city's no-fly rules and rushed into the city; there are Dao Origin Realm experts aboard, and we were unable to stop it. Please, Deputy City Lord, make a decision!"

"A tower ship? Dao Origin Realm?" Zhuang Pan's eyes narrowed involuntarily. In the next instant he lifted his gaze to Yang Kai's retreating back and suddenly bellowed, "Friend, halt!"

Saying so, he angrily urged his Origin Qi, his figure flashing like a specter as he appeared behind Yang Kai and reached out to slap his shoulder.

Sensing the movement behind him, Yang Kai shoved Mo Xiaoqi aside, turned, and thrust one palm out to meet Zhuang Pan's hand.

With a thunderous crack the Spiritual Qi of the hall trembled, and a gale tore through the chamber.

Yang Kai stood unmoving like a mountain; Zhuang Pan took a half step backward, his face growing even more sullen.

"What do you intend?" Yang Kai asked coldly, turning his body slightly as a chill glinted in his eyes.

Zhuang Pan jolted inwardly, but as a Dao Origin Realm expert he drew a deep breath to steady his surging Qi and said in a grave voice, "Friend, as Deputy City Lord of Fenglin City I have authority over the city's affairs. You have surely heard the guard's report—what I want to know is…"

"That tower ship is indeed mine," Yang Kai cut him off.

"You are bold!" Zhuang Pan snapped. "Flight is forbidden within Fenglin City, and no flying Secret Treasures may be used—this rule cannot be broken. Since you have ignored the City Lord's orders, I must demand an explanation from you."

Before Yang Kai could answer, Mo Xiaoqi stamped angrily at his side and cried, "You are unbelievable—Demonic Qi is about to assault Fenglin City, and you stand here quibbling over Eldest Brother Yang's tower ship. Do you not place the lives of the hundreds of thousands in Fenglin City above this?"

Zhuang Pan's eyes narrowed into slits and he snorted coldly. "Whether the matter is true or false aside, I cannot trust a single-sided account. But as for this friend breaking Fenglin City's rules—you will not be allowed to leave so easily. If you intend to go, you must first gain my approval."

"When death is at the doorstep, what good are rules?" Yang Kai sneered through his fury. "Xiaoqi, don't bother arguing with him—we've already carried the news. Whether he believes it or not is his concern. When the day comes that Fenglin City is drenched in blood and its people lie ruined, I'll be eager to see whether those hundreds of thousands of wronged souls won't haunt him day and night. Let's go!"

Mo Xiaoqi nodded, shot Zhuang Pan an angry glare, and followed closely after Yang Kai.

"This Lord says: if you wish to leave, you must first pass me!" Zhuang Pan roared, and a small pagoda-shaped Secret Treasure appeared in his hand. Origin Qi poured into it and it began to spin, shooting toward Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi.

As it flew, the small pagoda unfurled and instantly swelled into a hulking monstrosity over ten zhang high; its base was black as ink, and the Power of the Laws swirled about it, pressing down on Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi.

It looked as if it intended to crush the two of them outright within the pagoda.

"A Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure!" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed at the potent aura radiating from the tiny pagoda, and anger flared within him.

He gritted his teeth, produced a pale blue orb, and poured Origin Qi into it.

The pale blue orb was not large—only about the size of a longan—yet as Origin Qi flowed into it a thin, hopping arc of electricity appeared inside.

Mo Xiaoqi stared at the orb in astonishment and let out a light, surprised sound.

At that moment the electric arc inside the orb leapt forth like a swimming fish and, with a faint pop, shot toward the descending pagoda.

Zhuang Pan sneered with contempt, his hand signs shifting; the already-large pagoda swelled even greater.

Crack—

The electric arc plunged into the interior of the pagoda and vanished in an instant; the pagoda showed no reaction.

Zhuang Pan laughed derisively, taunting, "Your trick really is…eye-opening!"

Yang Kai merely stood there and responded with a cold smile.

Seeing his bizarre reaction, a sudden unease struck Zhuang Pan—an ill feeling rose within him.

Before he could even fathom what trump card Yang Kai might have, a crackling series of explosions suddenly erupted from within the descending tower. In the next breath, layer upon layer of dense lightning flared across its exterior, writhing like a host of mad demons, while the treasure’s spiritual light flickered uncertainly.

At the very instant that lightning burst forth, Zhuang Pan felt as though struck by thunder itself. His face drained pale, and he spewed out a jet of blood, his aura collapsing by more than half as he cried out in shock, “How is this possible?”
