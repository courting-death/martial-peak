## Chapter 2355 — Divine Butian Lotus

Earlier, when Yang Kai led Liu Qianyun into Jubao Tower, many people saw them. These martial artists had nothing better to do and naturally wanted to watch the excitement. Soon after, the bald burly man shut the main doors of Jubao Tower, leaving everyone unable to see what was happening inside.

Although they couldn’t see, the violent energy fluctuations and clattering sounds coming from within were unmistakable.

In just a short while, the crowd of onlookers had grown to several thousand martial artists.

At this moment, Yang Kai opened the door and walked out, instantly drawing the gaze of thousands of eyes.

No one could believe their own eyes. They all thought Yang Kai was reckless, daring to provoke Jubao Tower in Gao City—wasn’t this courting death? Not to mention that, with Jubao Tower backed by the City Lord, even the martial artists inside were formidable. The Shopkeeper in particular possessed peak Dao Origin Realm cultivation. If not for his age and ailing meridians and body, he might well have had the qualifications to break through to the Emperor Realm.

And Yang Kai, so young—even if he had some strength, it couldn’t possibly be that great.

They thought Yang Kai was destined to suffer a huge loss this time.

But reality left everyone utterly shocked.

Yang Kai strolled out of Jubao Tower, not only completely unharmed, but his clothes didn’t even have a wrinkle. Inside Jubao Tower, however, several corpses lay scattered, blood covering the floor. The bald burly man and the Shopkeeper were both pale-faced, their auras withered—clearly their cultivation had been crippled.

A chorus of sharp inhales sounded. Many martial artists looked at Yang Kai with changed expressions, realizing this young man was not someone to provoke—he was very likely an Emperor Realm expert.

After all, how long had he been inside? In just a few dozen breaths, he single-handedly turned Jubao Tower upside down. If he wasn’t an Emperor, how could he have such means?

As Yang Kai walked out, the martial artists closest to him instinctively retreated, their eyes full of wariness.

Yang Kai swept a cold gaze around, snorted, and ignored the crowd. He simply led Liu Qianyun across the street into the teahouse and returned to the third-floor table. He called for a fresh pot of spirit tea.

He had caused a huge commotion at Jubao Tower, injuring and killing its people, yet instead of fleeing, he went to the teahouse across the street to drink tea. This scene left the onlookers in disbelief once again.

One after another, they secretly admired Yang Kai’s audacity, thinking that if he wasn’t strong enough to fear Pang Guang, then his background must be impressive—enough to make Pang Guang hesitate.

But since they had no connection to Yang Kai, they couldn’t be bothered. Instead, the wide-open doors of Jubao Tower piqued their interest.

The martial artists who roamed Gao City were all ruthless, treating lives as worthless and acting fiercely. They didn’t care who was right or wrong in this matter. Now, with Jubao Tower’s spirit herbs, miraculous medicines, and rare treasures left unguarded, it was the perfect opportunity to make a move.

Although Jubao Tower was Pang Guang’s property, people die for wealth and birds for food. At this moment, some couldn’t resist the temptation.

After a brief silence, a figure suddenly darted from the crowd, rushing straight into Jubao Tower and sweeping all the spirit herbs and medicines from the cabinets into his spatial ring.

Seeing this, the others couldn’t hold back. They followed suit, and in no time, martial artists looting Jubao Tower were as numerous as fish in a river. In just a short while, the entire Jubao Tower was emptied. Anything of value vanished, and the looters quickly scattered like birds and beasts, disappearing without a trace.

Upstairs in the teahouse, Yang Kai watched the scene unfold, his face indifferent. Still, he gained a bit of understanding about the ways of Gao City’s martial artists.

“Senior Brother…” Liu Qianyun was on edge, unable to relax. She said timidly, “We should leave.”

It wasn’t that she doubted Yang Kai’s strength, but after causing such a huge commotion—especially since it all started because of her—she didn’t want to bring even stronger enemies upon him.

“No need.” Yang Kai smiled gently, poured her a cup of spirit tea, and asked, “Why did you come to such a chaotic place?”

He was still curious about Liu Qianyun’s experiences over the past few years. Back when they escaped Biyu Sect together, he gave half his possessions to Liu Qianyun, and they split up. Later, Yang Kai went to Fenglin City and worked his way up until now. He hadn’t expected to run into her while passing through Gao City this time.

“I’ve been here for several years.” Liu Qianyun gave a bitter smile and briefly recounted her experiences.

In truth, there wasn’t much to tell.

After parting ways with Yang Kai, she wandered the Southern Territory like a headless fly until she settled in Gao City. Although chaotic, the area had many places suitable for her to temper herself.

She could search those places for cultivation resources. After several tough years, she managed to advance to the Dao Origin Realm.

Some days ago, she obtained a spiritual medicine by chance at a place called Jixu Ridge nearby. She planned to sell it for some source crystals and buy some Origin Condensing Pills. She thought Jubao Tower, backed by the City Lord, would be reliable, but after she presented the spiritual medicine, they only offered her ten thousand lower-level source crystals.

Liu Qianyun didn’t know what the spiritual medicine was or its effects, but instinctively felt it was worth far more than that, so she refused to sell. After some argument, they attacked her, and the rest Yang Kai already knew.

“Senior Brother, take this spiritual medicine. I don’t know what it is,” Liu Qianyun said, handing the jade box to Yang Kai.

“Let me see.” Yang Kai took it, dispelled the restriction, and opened the box a crack.

Instantly, a refreshing fragrance wafted out. As Yang Kai inhaled, his spirit lifted, and his Sea of Consciousness became much clearer.

With a snap, Yang Kai hurriedly closed the box, his face full of disbelief.

Warm Spirit Lotus?

Although he only opened the box a sliver, his divine sense clearly saw the spiritual medicine inside. It looked exactly like his Warm Spirit Lotus, except it was pure white instead of multicolored, and the aura it emitted was similar—just like a miniature version of the Warm Spirit Lotus.

No, that’s not right! This isn’t the Warm Spirit Lotus. Legend has it the Warm Spirit Lotus is a supreme treasure of heaven and earth, like the Everlasting Tree—there’s only one in the world, never a second.

“Divine Butian Lotus?” Yang Kai suddenly recalled the information recorded in the jade slip left by Great Emperor Miaodan’s Third Disciple, Gongsun Mu, and immediately recognized what the spiritual medicine was.

This was clearly the legendary Divine Butian Lotus!

Although the Divine Butian Lotus isn’t as precious or unique as the Warm Spirit Lotus, it’s still a legendary item, like the Life Origin Fruit—both are extinct treasures.

Using the Divine Butian Lotus as the main ingredient, one can refine the Butian Pill. While it doesn’t have the power to bring the dead back to life, it can repair a martial artist’s shattered meridians and dantian—truly a miraculous item.

For example, although Yang Kai had crippled the bald burly man and the Shopkeeper's cultivation, if they could take a Butian Pill, their damaged meridians and dantian would be fully restored within three months.

But this thing only existed in legends—no one has ever seen it.

The people from Jubao Tower tried to buy the Divine Butian Lotus for just ten thousand lower-level source crystals. Who knows what they were thinking! Ten thousand lower-level source crystals wouldn’t even be enough to take a whiff of its fragrance.

The people at Jubao Tower might not have recognized the Divine Butian Lotus, but they definitely knew it was valuable. If they truly tried to buy it, they probably couldn’t afford it, so they resorted to force.

The Butian Pill’s effects aren’t limited to repairing meridians and dantian—it has other miraculous uses as well.

In short, the value of the Butian Pill is immeasurable.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected Liu Qianyun to be so fortunate as to obtain a divine treasure like this.

“Junior Sister, do you remember where you found this spiritual medicine?” Yang Kai asked solemnly.

"Deep inside Jixu Ridge…" Liu Qianyun recalled with a trace of fear. "I was being chased by a demonic beast and fled in panic. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have gone there. I’ve heard that even Emperor Realm experts can’t return safely from the deepest part of Jixu Ridge. I only managed to return by sheer luck."

“If you went again, could you find the right path?”

“Go again?” Liu Qianyun’s pretty face turned pale, and she asked in confusion, “Why would we go back?”

She had only survived last time by luck. If she went again, Liu Qianyun was sure she wouldn’t make it out alive, so she didn’t understand why Yang Kai would risk it.

“Because…” Yang Kai was about to explain, but before he could finish, he suddenly frowned and looked downstairs.

Looking down, Yang Kai’s eyes fell upon a middle-aged man standing before the doors of Jubao Tower. The man wore luxurious robes and bore a dark, brooding expression. His presence was extraordinary—clearly an Emperor Realm expert. Sensing Yang Kai’s gaze, the man looked up in that instant, his eyes sharp as a hawk’s, piercing and cold.

“It’s Pang Guang!” Liu Qianyun exclaimed, her heart filled with anxiety.

After years in Gao City, Liu Qianyun naturally knew what Pang Guang looked like. Seeing him personally arrive, she immediately knew trouble was coming.

She didn’t know why Yang Kai was confident enough to stay, but an Emperor Realm expert was not someone to provoke lightly.

Then, Pang Guang suddenly moved, vanishing from sight.

When he reappeared, he was already on the third floor of the teahouse, standing before Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun.

Liu Qianyun screamed in fright, her face instantly drained of blood.
