## Chapter 2488 — You Can't Court Death Like This

There was only one person whom Mo Xiaoqi would call an old swindler.

Back in Fenglin City, there was an old man who once tricked her out of her Source Crystals.

That old man had spent years frequenting the black market in Fenglin City, his skills in cheating and swindling reaching the peak of perfection. When the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda of Star God Palace opened that year, this old swindler also went in, peddling his so-called ancestral Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill to many cultivators!

Even though Yang Kai was an Imperial-Grade Alchemist, he had never heard of such a thing as the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill.

Later, Yang Kai had a few more dealings with this old swindler. The most recent was when Fenglin City was surrounded by Demonic Qi, and the old swindler came running from the nearby Senmu City to ask for help.

This old fellow always gave Yang Kai a strange feeling, as if something was off about him in every way.

Yang Kai always felt that this old man was hiding some secret, but the old fellow came and went like a shadow, with the air of a dragon whose head could be seen but not its tail, making it impossible for Yang Kai to investigate.

As time passed, Yang Kai gradually forgot about him.

He never expected to see him again here in the Origin Sea.

Only, this time, the old swindler looked completely different. In the past, he wore ragged clothes, his hair was yellow and withered, and his mouth full of yellow teeth was nauseating—he looked just like a beggar.

But now, the old fellow's clothes were bright and clean, his hair neatly groomed, and he wore a black robe. With his kindly face and gentle gaze, he actually exuded an immortal-like aura.

Yang Kai's eyes nearly popped out.

He never imagined that a person could change so much. Who knew where this old swindler had struck it rich in recent years to look so radiant now?

What shocked Yang Kai even more was that the old swindler now had the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, on par with himself.

This discovery was simply unbelievable to Yang Kai.

Back in Fenglin City, this old man was only at the Void King Realm. How had he, in just a few short years, reached such a formidable level of cultivation? Was his talent truly so heaven-defying? If that were the case, why had he only shown such explosive growth so late in life? With such aptitude, he should have stood out in his youth, not waited until old age to reveal his strength.

Yang Kai couldn't figure it out, and the more he thought about it, the stranger the old man seemed.

As he pondered, Yang Kai suddenly felt a chill and realized he had overlooked something.

When he had checked his surroundings earlier, for some reason, he hadn't noticed the old man's presence. Only after Mo Xiaoqi reminded him did he snap out of it. Or perhaps, he had seen him but hadn't realized it was someone he knew.

For this to happen to him was truly unbelievable.

Just as Yang Kai was full of suspicion, unsure of who this old swindler really was, a sudden shout came from the other side: "You again, brat!"

Yang Kai turned his head and saw Liang Qiu from the Western Territory's Hundred Barbarian Mountain glaring at him, sneering, "Where's your big cousin? Didn't he come with you?"

"Big cousin had something to do and left first!" Yang Kai replied offhandedly. "Are you looking for him?"

Liang Qiu snorted coldly. “I have no business with him, but you’re in trouble now.”

Yang Kai raised his brows in mild surprise. “And what trouble would that be?”

Liang Qiu said, "Brat, don't think that just because you have some skill you can ignore all the experts in the world. Earlier, I was busy refining and absorbing my Origin, so I didn't want to stoop to your level. Now that you dare show up here again, don't blame me for being rude!"

As he spoke, his spear trembled, pointing straight at Yang Kai, and a powerful spear intent erupted.

Yang Kai sneered inwardly, knowing this guy couldn't find a suitable target and was picking on him as the easy one to make an example of.

He felt no fear, only looked calmly at Liang Qiu and said, "Why are you pointing your spear at me? Are you planning to attack?"

Liang Qiu shouted angrily, "Don't play dumb! I admit your talent is decent. Cultivation is not easy, so I'll give you a chance. Take your female companions and get out of here now, or if you lose face later, you'll never be able to lift your head in front of these beauties again."

As he blustered, Liang Qiu was also cursing inwardly, because at this moment Yang Kai was surrounded by several beautiful women, even a seven- or eight-year-old girl among them, making him... envious, jealous, and resentful!

"You want to bully the weak with strength, outnumber the few with the many? Hmph, I'm not afraid of you! If you have the guts, come at me and see who loses face! If you want me to leave, dream on! We martial artists would rather die standing than live kneeling!"

"Well said, Young Brother! We're with you!"

"Don't be afraid, Young Brother. If he dares attack you, we'll fight him together."

"That's right, we're all your backup. Don't be afraid of him!"

In the distance, the group of cultivators who had been driven away started shouting noisily. It was unclear if they were just making a scene or genuinely cheering for Yang Kai, but probably more the former. Regardless of Yang Kai's background or abilities, his defiance of Liang Qiu's tyranny was inspiring and uplifting.

As for whether Yang Kai lived or died in the end, that was none of their concern.

Liang Qiu’s face darkened, his nose practically crooked with rage. With so many eyes watching, he felt utterly humiliated. He barked out, “Fine! Since you’re so stubborn, I’ll grant your wish and see it through to the end!”

Liang Qiu’s face was dark with rage, his nose practically crooked from anger. With so many eyes watching, he felt utterly humiliated. He barked out, “Fine! Since you’re so stubborn, I’ll grant your wish and see it through to the end!”

His spear suddenly trembled, erupting with a brilliant light that wrapped around his body. In a flash, he shot toward Yang Kai like a bolt of lightning, piercing through the void as if tearing across the ages from the Primordial Era itself.

Over there, Xia Sheng's expression changed slightly. Now that he had advanced to the Emperor Realm, he could sense the ferocity of Liang Qiu's move. Even he couldn't be sure he could take it head-on.

Let alone Yang Kai, who was only at the Dao Origin Realm. And with several female companions at his side, this strike would surely leave Yang Kai dead or crippled.

In a flash, Xia Sheng was about to step in to help.

But before he could act, Yang Kai suddenly moved—not retreating, but advancing straight toward Liang Qiu.

The distance between them closed rapidly. Liang Qiu, charging in with overwhelming momentum, was momentarily stunned, not understanding what Yang Kai was up to.

"Eldest Brother Yang!" Mo Xiaoqi cried out in alarm, "Don't be reckless!"

Zhang Ruoxi's face turned pale, her body going limp as she collapsed, but Liu Yan quickly supported her, her expression calm.

Only she had complete confidence in Yang Kai, not thinking he was any weaker than an Emperor. Since Yang Kai dared to charge forward, he must have something to rely on.

As Yang Kai and Liang Qiu were about to collide, Mo Xiaoqi screamed, "If you dare hurt my Eldest Brother Yang, I'll have my father wipe out everyone in the Hundred Barbarian Mountain!"

The always gentle Mo Xiaoqi suddenly erupted with a violent aura, wild beast patterns spreading across her exposed skin, making her look utterly savage.

Liang Qiu burst out laughing, "Where did this little brat come from, still wet behind the ears and already so arrogant! If I kill your Eldest Brother Yang today, so what?"

As the top disciple of the Hundred Barbarian Mountain in the Western Territory, Liang Qiu was extremely proud. Among his peers, few could catch his eye. Mo Xiaoqi's threat was nothing to him, not only failing to make him wary, but making his attack even more ruthless.

The tip of his spear shone brightly, murderous intent surging.

Yang Kai shouted, "Take my Tyrant Fist!"

As he spoke, he smashed his fist fiercely toward Liang Qiu's spear.

"Hiss... Is this kid crazy?"

"He dares to take on Liang Qiu's spear Secret Treasure with his bare flesh? He's courting death!"

"It's over, it's over. He'll probably be blasted to pieces."

"Pitiful. He thought he was something special and got arrogant. His end is bound to be tragic. Junior Brother, remember this: when you travel the Star Realm in the future, never act like him. We men must be able to bend and stretch."

"Senior Brother is right. I'll remember it."

The cultivators who had loudly supported Yang Kai earlier now just sighed, convinced he was doomed. Even the Emperors thought Yang Kai was unlikely to survive. No matter how strong the flesh, how could it withstand a Secret Treasure head-on?

Liang Qiu's spear was a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure, incomparably sharp. With his current Emperor Realm cultivation, a single thrust could shatter a mountain, let alone Yang Kai's body.

Xia Sheng was anxious, but he had no chance to help. Yang Kai and Liang Qiu were too fast—he couldn't intervene in time.

"Foolish!" Yao Si snorted coldly, turning his gaze away. He couldn't be bothered with someone about to die.

But the abnormal state of Mo Xiaoqi over there made him narrow his eyes, a sense of unease welling up.

"Kid, you... you can't court death like this!" Liang Qiu stared blankly at Yang Kai, muttering. Although Mo Xiaoqi's words had provoked him to want to kill Yang Kai, seeing Yang Kai's determined stance, he couldn't help but hold back a little.

Boom...

A loud explosion erupted, light engulfing both Yang Kai and Liang Qiu, making it impossible to see what was happening inside.

Just when Liang Qiu thought victory was within his grasp, his eyes suddenly widened. With a fierce shake of his spear, he conjured a flurry of spear blossoms, instantly blanketing a vast area before him.

Bang, bang, bang...

Countless fist shadows burst forth, colliding with the myriad spear blossoms.

"Damn!" Liang Qiu cursed, his face turning grim. He desperately channeled his Origin Qi, but still felt a massive force coming from ahead, forcing him to retreat more than a dozen zhang.

The other figure also retreated rapidly at the same time.

When the dust settled, everyone in the void stared wide-eyed.

The scene they imagined—Yang Kai being blasted to pieces—did not appear. At this moment, Yang Kai was perfectly fine, except for his fist, which was a bloody mess, but he had no other injuries.

And the wound on his fist healed completely in an instant!
