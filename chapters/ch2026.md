## Chapter 2026 — Farewell

Until he broke through to the Dao Origin Realm, the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade remained useful to him.

Among the Secret Treasures in his possession, the most precious were the four Imperial Treasures, but none of them could be displayed openly before others; aside from those, only the Dragon Bone sword remained.

Yang Kai had already resolved to take time to fuse the Dragon Bone sword into his body, so that Secret Treasure was destined to disappear. The Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade happened to fill that vacancy; it was not of an especially high rank, so using it would not attract attention, and unusually it could stir a faint thread of the Power of the Laws.

With that in mind, Yang Kai put the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade away and did not bother to temper it fully, so as not to waste time; that way, when something better appeared he could replace it at any moment.

Afterwards he solemnly retrieved the Ethereal Jade Disc from the Spatial Ring.

When the dark, round jade appeared, Yang Kai immediately sensed it was different from earlier that day: the Ethereal Jade Disc trembled slightly, emitting deep, mysterious fluctuations of power, its surface rippling with layer upon layer of inky waves.

The black jade seemed to darken further, like a void swallowing light, as if it sought to consume everything around it.

"There really is a reaction!" Seeing this, Yang Kai knew the Ethereal Jade Disc's behavior was entirely due to Zhang Ruoxi's proximity; when he had looked at it in daylight it had been as still as an ancient well.

At that moment he felt unmistakable Spatial Power fluctuations issuing from the Ethereal Jade Disc — if one lingered within such fluctuations, one might glean methods for cultivating Spatial Power.

Back then Zhang Ruoxi had stayed at the Lu household for a month. During that time, Lu Baichuan seized the opportunity to delve into Spatial Power.

Now that he considered it, Lu Baichuan’s desire to marry his descendant to Zhang Ruoxi had been driven entirely by the Ethereal Jade Disc; one could even say he had schemed against the Zhang Family with this in mind.

However, Yang Kai still could not use these fluctuations to probe anything; he had no idea what would happen if Zhang Ruoxi came into contact with the jade.

Although the jade now lay in his hands, at heart it still belonged to the Zhang Family. Yang Kai could keep it as spoils and need not return it — the Zhangs had little standing to complain — but if he went back to pry into the jade's secrets, justification would be difficult.

The people of the Zhang Family might not even have known its true value! Otherwise, two hundred years ago they would not have given it as a dowry to the Lu Family.

It seemed everything still had to depend on himself.

Yang Kai quietly set himself to the task.

Over the next two days Yang Kai remained at the Zhang Family and never left the guest room, constantly probing for the secrets hidden within the Ethereal Jade Disc, but unfortunately he uncovered nothing.

When he realized his probing was useless, he saw no point in staying and immediately prepared to leave to bid farewell to the Zhang Family's matron.

The old matron and the middle-aged beauty repeatedly urged him to stay; seeing Yang Kai's resolve, they did not press further but personally escorted him out beyond the estate.

"Benefactor, please take care in the days ahead. Should you ever find the time, we humbly invite you to visit our Zhang Family again. All of us would receive you with the highest courtesy." After two days' rest the old matron's complexion had improved somewhat, but she was, after all, advanced in years; the battle had drained much of her vital energy, from which she could never fully recover.

Seeing her so warm and earnest, Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, "If the chance arises, then I only ask that Madam not despise my visit when the time comes."

"Benefactor, you saved the Zhang Family this time; we Zhangs are truly at a loss for how to repay you. Seeing you are alone, daily life may be inconvenient—I'd like Ruoxi to go with you to attend to your daily needs; please do not refuse!" The middle-aged beauty said this as she pulled Zhang Ruoxi out from behind her.

"Ah?" Yang Kai was stunned for a moment, having not expected such a proposal before his departure, and reflexively looked toward the girl.

The girl kept her head lowered, playing with the corner of her robe, her face flushed yet obediently silent.

A strange feeling surged in Yang Kai's chest, but he quickly understood the middle-aged woman's intention.

She clearly felt that the Zhang Family’s vitality had been gravely wounded and feared that one day a powerful enemy might come calling. Thus, she wished to cultivate a good rapport with him, hoping that he might become the Zhang Family’s protector — with Zhang Ruoxi serving as the bridge that bound the two sides together.

If he truly agreed, then for Zhang Ruoxi's sake he would not stand idly by when trouble came.

Understanding this, Yang Kai frowned, instinctively resistant, yet unable to refuse outright.

Because his original plan had been to first deal with matters concerning Kang Siran, then return to Fenglin City and visit the Zhang Family frequently to study the Ethereal Jade Disc; otherwise he would not have told the old matron he would come again.

He had never imagined the Zhang Family would already intend to send Zhang Ruoxi to him.

This left him both averse to the idea and quietly pleased, as if he had found something others had sought in vain.

Seeing Yang Kai silent, Zhang Ruoxi seemed even more embarrassed; the middle-aged beauty smiled and said, "Although Ruoxi's cultivation is not high and she cannot help you in battle, she is naturally talented, quiet in disposition, dexterous with her hands—if you take her, you will not be troubled by trifles and can devote yourself to cultivation, reaching the Dao Origin Realm sooner."

The middle-aged matron continued earnestly promoting Zhang Ruoxi before Yang Kai while watching his expression closely, saying, "I only fear… Benefactor may find her unworthy. If that is so, then let it be — it only means Ruoxi lacks the fortune for such a blessing."

At those words Zhang Ruoxi trembled and clenched both small hands into fists.

“Miss Ruoxi is gentle and clever; how could I possibly look down on her? It is only that…” Yang Kai frowned slightly. As he spoke, he glanced toward the old matron and saw her watching him with hopeful eyes. At once, he understood that this matter had likely been discussed between her and the middle-aged woman beforehand.


Perhaps that night at the feast he had looked at Zhang Ruoxi a few times, which led them to misunderstand.

Seeing Zhang Ruoxi with her head bowed, lips bitten, on the verge of tears, Yang Kai sighed and swallowed the refusal; he said, "I don't want to force anyone. This must be asked of Ruoxi herself—if she wants to go with me, I can take her away; if she does not, then forget it."

The middle-aged beauty heaved a sigh of relief and smiled, "Of course."

Looking at Zhang Ruoxi she said, "Girl, Benefactor asks you—answer truthfully: do you wish to leave with Benefactor and from then on serve him as a maid?"

Zhang Ruoxi did not dare lift her head and only nodded lightly.

The middle-aged beauty smiled, "You should speak plainly; otherwise Benefactor won't know your thoughts."

Zhang Ruoxi then, in a voice no louder than a mosquito, said, "Willing!"

The middle-aged beauty pursed her lips and looked at Yang Kai, saying, "See, she is willing; no one is forcing her."

Yang Kai sighed, "Very well. If that is so, then you shall come with me."

"Thank you, sir." Zhang Ruoxi then gave a graceful bow.

"Rest assured, as long as I am around, I will not let anyone bully you—please, Madam, rest easy on that point." Yang Kai turned to the old matron and spoke earnestly.

The old matron smiled, "It is Ruoxi's good fortune to follow Benefactor; our Zhang Family trusts your character."

Yang Kai nodded and looked at Zhang Ruoxi, "If you have anything to say to your family, say it now; I will wait ahead."

After saying that, Yang Kai leapt and flew a short distance away.

Looking back, Zhang Ruoxi was nestled in the old matron's arms, sobbing endlessly; the old matron kept patting her shoulder to comfort her and whispering admonitions.

Afterwards Zhang Ruoxi bade farewell to the middle-aged beauty and the others one by one; before leaving she kowtowed three times toward the Zhang Family's estate, then, taking three steps forward and looking back thrice, walked toward Yang Kai.

When she came near, she wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and said softly, "Sir, I am ready."

Yang Kai chuckled, "No need to make it like a life-and-death parting. I live in Fenglin City; if you miss home you can come back at any time—I won't bind you."

Zhang Ruoxi shook her head and said softly, “Great-Grandmother told me that, from this day on, I am no longer a member of the Zhang Family. Unless there is urgent need, I should not return—my duty is simply to attend to Sir with all my heart.”

Yang Kai was taken aback for a moment, then nodded, "The Madam means well."

The old matron had given that instruction clearly to avoid provoking him, and she had no idea he did not care; moreover, the real reason he agreed to take Zhang Ruoxi was not what they believed, but such matters were troublesome to explain, and Yang Kai was too lazy to do so.

As they flew back, Yang Kai had no superior flying Secret Treasure—only a Star Shuttle he had bought years ago in his home Star Domain, which had long since become obsolete with his rising cultivation.

He wrapped Zhang Ruoxi in his power and carried her back by flight.

Zhang Ruoxi had only the First Stage of the Saint King Realm and had never left the Zhang Family; she had never experienced such rapid flight and shut her eyes tight, fists clenched, looking as if she were walking to the execution ground.

Seeing this, Yang Kai smiled and shook his head, saying nothing.

A short while later they arrived before the gates of Fenglin City, descended, and entered the city.

The girl rarely came into town; used to serving the old matron, she looked around in wonder.

Yang Kai noticed her clothes were plain and she wore no jewelry. He had wanted to give her a few things but feared she might misunderstand, so he refrained.

Arriving at his cave dwelling, Yang Kai took out his identity plaque and was about to lift the cave's restriction when suddenly someone sprang out from beside him and hurriedly said, "Pillmaster Yang, you have finally returned."

He turned at the sound. Seeing a familiar face, he let out a light chuckle. "So it's you."

The man was a worker from the Spiritual Pill workshop; Yang Kai had seen him before when visiting to refine pills.

“It is I, Sir.” The attendant bowed to Yang Kai. After straightening, he cast a puzzled glance at Zhang Ruoxi, unable to fathom why Yang Kai was accompanied by a First Stage Saint King woman.
