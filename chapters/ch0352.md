## Chapter 352 — Provocation

Watching Xiang Chu's back, Yang Kai felt a moment of astonishment.

Initially, seeing that a group of people here did not seem to welcome him, Yang Kai had assumed that this person was some kind of arrogant young master.

The Xiang family was a prestigious family, so it was quite normal for a young master born into such a large family to be somewhat spoiled and overbearing.

However, seeing him behave appropriately and respond gracefully, with a gentle and refined demeanor, made Yang Kai admire him somewhat.

Yang Kai could clearly see the affection Xiang Chu held for the Sisters from the Hu Family. He didn't hide it in the slightest, and even though Hu Jiao’er treated him coldly, he showed no annoyance and didn't entangle himself, which could be considered the mark of a true gentleman.

For some reason, the Sisters from the Hu Family and everyone here didn't seem to like him very much.

Yet, there must be a reason behind everything. Yang Kai understood that people's hearts are often hidden, so he instinctively felt that Xiang Chu definitely had aspects unknown to others.

After Xiang Chu's figure disappeared, Fang Ziqi leaned closer to Yang Kai and chuckled, “Yang Kai, don’t be fooled by that guy. He seems amiable, but he's actually quite scheming and deep-minded; otherwise, he wouldn’t be in charge of this place.”

“I know.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, not intending to underestimate Xiang Chu.

People like Bai Yunfeng, openly overbearing and whose intentions were written on their faces, were no threat to Yang Kai at all.

Rather, someone like Xiang Chu, who appeared to be smiling, was the one to watch out for.

“This place is under his command?” Hu Jiao’er picked up on the unusual tone in Fang Ziqi’s words and looked at him in surprise. “What’s going on? He’s just part of the younger generation; how could he be in charge here? Isn’t there an elder from the Xiang family stationed here?”

Fang Ziqi was taken aback, chuckling awkwardly and glancing at Guan Chile.

“Misses, you two have traveled a long way. Why don’t you rest first? I’ll explain things to you tonight.” Guan Chile hesitated before speaking.

“Alright.” Hu Jiao’er did not press further; she too sensed that something was off, and she really needed to clean up after spending a month hiding alongside Yang Kai.

Women tend to be more particular about cleanliness.

“Yang Kai, come with me.” Fang Ziqi warmly beckoned.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and followed him.

At night, bonfires were lit outside. The Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower members gathered in this area. The flames danced as Yang Kai and Fang Ziqi roasted some game.

With a crackling sound, silence fell over the gathering.

After a long while, Hu Jiao’er finally asked, “Uncle Le, what’s going on here? There seem to be significantly fewer masters around. Where have the senior members of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower gone?”

When they left two to three months ago, there were still quite a few experts in the Divine Roaming Realm here, but upon returning, they found that there were fewer than ten left. Besides two powerful ones guarding Xiang Chu, the others were not particularly strong either.

Though this location wasn’t particularly important along the entire front line, having so few experts in charge seemed utterly irresponsible. If the enemy attacked from across the mountain, everyone here would likely perish.

Guan Chile sighed, stating despondently, “About a month ago, we received orders from the Eight Great Families in Zhongdu, summoning all the experts involved in besieging the Cangyun Evil Land to gather in the capital, as it seems the Eight Great Families and the Evil Lord wish to engage in a final battle.”

“Final battle?” Hu Jiao’er exclaimed.

Guan Chile nodded slightly. “After all, we’re not an army; we are just rogues harboring grievances. After such a prolonged conflict, everyone longs for an end. It seems both sides have reached some consensus, hence most of the experts here have been recalled, including your father.”

“Father also went…” Hu Mei’er murmured.

Though Hu Man had the strength of the Eighth Stage in the Divine Roaming Realm and was a prominent figure, in the grand scheme of the world, he was still nothing much. Being called to participate in the decisive battle could lead to dire consequences with just a slight misstep.

Wouldn’t the Sisters from the Hu Family be worried?

“The same applies to us at Fengyu Tower; my master and the elders have all left. Most of the experts on the other side have gone as well,” Fang Ziqi said with a bitter smile; his master was Xiao Ruohan, the head of Fengyu Tower.

“If it weren’t for the gang leader’s insistence, I wouldn’t have been able to stay behind,” Guan Chile said, his expression turning gloomy. He looked up and continued, “The gang leader said that the two misses would definitely return to seek him one day, so he allowed me to stay behind—one, to care for these young people, and two, to wait for you two. Given the circumstances, the gang leader’s decision has proven to be remarkably wise.”

Upon hearing this, Fang Ziqi became extremely indignant, gritting his teeth as he said, “If it weren’t for Elder Guan’s repeated protection, the ten or so of us from both the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower would probably have perished long ago.”

“What happened?” Hu Jiao’er’s expression darkened.

“It’s just as I said,” Fang Ziqi sneered. “Because our two factions are near the Lingxiao Pavilion, the people here don’t take us seriously. It was better when you two were present; Xiang Chu had to maintain a good showing in front of you. But once you vanished, Xiang Chu no longer paid us any mind. Whenever there’s danger, it’s always the disciples from our two factions who step up.”

His expression darkened as he added, “When we came here, we were over a hundred strong; now? There are barely a dozen left.”

Having witnessed many of his junior brothers and sisters meet tragic ends, the pain in Fang Ziqi’s heart was palpable.

Pausing for a moment, Fang Ziqi suddenly remembered something and awkwardly looked at Yang Kai, saying, “Don’t take it to heart; I meant no offense.”

“I understand.” Yang Kai nodded lightly. While Fang Ziqi said this to avoid misunderstandings, Yang Kai also knew that due to the Lingxiao Pavilion’s influence, the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower had been severely affected.

This point was indeed a burden on both factions from the Lingxiao Pavilion.

But it was also the external forces that were stirring trouble! Just because the Evil Lord came from a certain sect, the Lingxiao Pavilion was burned to the ground, bringing the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower along for the ride. This was utterly unreasonable.

After hearing Guan Chile’s explanation, Hu Jiao’er thought for a moment and said, “Since that’s the case, then this line of defense is even less important, right?”

Guan Chile nodded slightly. “Indeed. In as little as three to five days, and at most half a month, the decisive battle will begin. The battlefield over there will determine the conflict’s outcome. Therefore, neither we nor those on the other side care much about one another. For now, we only need to wait for results; it’s unlikely there will be conflict between us and them again.”

“Oh.” Hu Jiao’er nodded slightly.

“That’s why the Xiang family can confidently entrust this place to Xiang Chu,” Fang Ziqi chuckled. “They probably want to use this rare opportunity to hone his skills.”

Such opportunities were rare; there were at least five or six forces gathered here, and when various groups converged, disputes were bound to arise. If Xiang Chu could handle the affairs here well, he would undoubtedly be capable of managing the Xiang family’s matters in the future and potentially become the head of the Xiang family!

The Xiang family was nurturing him as a future successor.

Upon learning of these matters, the Sisters from the Hu Family were relieved, although they still had some worries about Hu Man’s safety.

The game was roasted and emitted a delicious aroma. Yang Kai ate heartily without restraint, and the Sisters from the Hu Family also found it hard to resist temptation, eating gracefully.

The past month following Yang Kai had been quite challenging.

As they ate and chatted, the atmosphere turned harmonious and joyful, especially as the remaining members thought about potentially returning to their sect soon, their spirits brightening further. Fang Ziqi unexpectedly brought out some wine, drinking heartily with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai showed no fear and matched him cup for cup.

Just as they were enjoying themselves, a group of people ambled over from the darkness.

Leading them was a young man and woman, both appearing quite young. The man was handsome, and the woman was beautiful.

Especially the woman, her figure was enchanting, and her tight-fitting clothes accentuated her curves perfectly. She wore no sleeves, exposing two snow-white arms; even in the night, her delicate fairness was clearly visible.

They approached with strange smiles, followed by many others.

When they got within about ten zhang, the young man suddenly stumbled, nearly falling to the ground.

With his movement, a large handful of sand and dirt flew up, smashing against the members of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower.

“Ah!” The young man exaggeratedly exclaimed, seemingly rushing to regain his balance.

The members of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower, who were enjoying their meals, didn’t expect such a turn of events. When they sensed something awry, Guan Chile casually waved his hand to summon a gust of wind, but couldn’t block all the sand.

Among the sand, there was clearly some True Yuan hidden.

Bang! Bang! Bang...

Many were struck directly, feeling a burning sensation on their faces and bodies. Even the jars of wine and the roasted meat on the bonfire became tainted.

With a start, the members of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower leaped up, casting dark looks at the newcomers.

The young man feigned adjusting his waist with a shocked expression, saying, “I almost fell!”

The young woman laughed charmingly, “Thank you, Senior Brother Xie, how could you be so careless?”

Xie Rong replied, “Junior Sister Li Fu, you may not know this, but I was watching a monkey perform earlier, and I got distracted for a moment.”

Li Fu covered her mouth with a light laugh, glancing around with innocent eyes, saying, “Senior Brother, you jest! At this hour, where did the monkey come from? Junior Sister didn’t see it at all!”

Xie Rong chuckled, “Junior Sister, your eyesight is poor. This monkey not only performs but also knows how to eat meat and drink wine. Isn’t that strange?”

Li Fu was immediately filled with surprise, “Really? In this world, there are such clever monkeys! Junior Sister must see it for herself. Where is it? Where is it?”

As she spoke, her beautiful eyes sparkled as she looked over toward the bonfire, her delicate face wearing a sneer of disdain.

Hearing their veiled mockery, the members of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower immediately turned sullen.
