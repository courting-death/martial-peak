## Chapter 753 — In Life, Kill Not a Single Soul

Sensing their malicious intent, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Saintess’s expression shifted; she suddenly raised a hand, and a subtle force burst forth from her Spirit Body.

That force was astonishingly strange—devoid of any killing intent or malice—yet when it appeared it fell like heaven-sent rain, scintillating and covering Yang Kai, Hai Wangu, and the Cheng elder, seeping into their Spirit Bodies and vanishing.

The three frowned, uncertain what the Saintess intended.

Strangely, after her action Yang Kai felt his heart calm considerably; a comfortable ease rose within him from the inside out, and thoughts of leaving worldly turmoil to live in seclusion began to circle his mind, draining his interest in everything before him.

Startled, he hastily gathered himself and drove away the languor, only to look at Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder and find them similarly pacified—their restless fluctuations had been soothed, and each seemed much clearer in spirit.

It appeared the Saintess’s Soul Technique could cleanse and calm a person’s mind.

Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder exchanged glances, brows tight; after pondering for a long moment, Hai Wangu said, “You saw what happened just now, Your Highness the Saintess, didn’t you?”

The Saintess’s lovely face changed; she forced a smile. “Yes, but rest assured, I will not speak of it. I do not want others to know I came here. What we need most now is to find a way out and leave—what do you think?”

Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder fell silent, their expressions dark as if deep in thought.

The Saintess grew uneasy; although her peculiar Soul Technique had temporarily steadied their minds, these two were ill-natured by temperament—once wicked thoughts took hold, even her technique might not control their actions.

She quickly cast a pleading glance at Yang Kai. Yang Kai pretended not to notice.

The Saintess ground her teeth in frustration.

After a long moment, Hai Wangu suddenly said, “Brother Cheng, what say you?”

The Cheng elder drew a long breath and said in a deep voice, “Now that matters have come this far, either do nothing or do it thoroughly.”

Hai Wangu smiled ferociously. “No wonder—you and I think alike, Brother Cheng.”

He cast a cold glance at the Saintess and sneered, “Saintess or not, no one here cares about your status; if you die here, no one will know.”

The Saintess’s face finally drained of color—she realized the two elders intended to kill to silence witnesses and preserve their secret.

So many outsiders had already died and the Seven Families Alliance had suffered losses; if the truth spread it would gravely harm the Hai Family and the Cheng Family.

And this place was indeed perfect for a clean-up.

As they spoke, their soul fluctuations rose again, revealing a wild, evil aura; without warning, two pure, dangerous Divine Sense attacks suddenly surged toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s cultivation seemed lower, so Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder naturally aimed to deal with him first before turning on the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Saintess.

Yang Kai’s expression chilled; at the instant those attacks struck, he suddenly evaded.

Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder were both somewhat astonished.

“I’ll hold one of them for you. One-on-one you should be able to win, right?” Yang Kai called to the Saintess, then beckoned Hai Wangu with a curl of his finger and a contemptuous smile. “Old man, come with me!”

“Brat, you’re courting death!” Hai Wangu snorted, easily provoked by Yang Kai, and hurried after him.

Under normal circumstances Hai Wangu wouldn’t obey so readily, but having devoured so much other people’s soul energy his judgment was clouded; instinct largely drove his actions, and Yang Kai’s provocation sent him charging.

“Hey—” The Saintess panicked and tried to explain to Yang Kai, but suddenly saw the Cheng elder’s murderous strike race toward her; her face changed and she hurriedly used a Soul Technique to defend.

Yang Kai had already led Hai Wangu far off; he didn’t engage, only dodging Divine Sense strikes while taking the chance to observe the Saintess’s situation.

He had planned to let the Saintess eliminate Hai Wangu and the others so he wouldn’t have to reveal his strength or the secret of his Divine Sense Fire before her.

He also believed, given the Saintess’s background and foundation, that she should be capable of it.

Though her cultivation was a little lower than Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and the Seven Families Alliance were leagues apart, and from the Soul Technique she had just displayed she indeed possessed that capability.

But after watching a while, Yang Kai sensed something amiss.

Under the Cheng elder’s relentless assault she only defended and dodged—she showed no intention to counterattack.

From her demeanor and movements she had ample opportunity and the conditions to strike back, but she did not seize them.

It wasn’t that she lacked the means; it was as if she had no will to fight the Cheng elder.

“What are you doing?” Yang Kai shouted in annoyance. “Fight back! Why do you keep running?”

“I—” The Saintess, helpless to cry, managed only a syllable before another killing move from the Cheng elder forced her to evade.

“Kid, you should watch yourself!” Hai Wangu stalked after Yang Kai, close behind, laughing grimly.

Yang Kai glanced coldly at him, shifted his direction, and charged toward the Saintess.

Before long he caught up to her and demanded, “What’s wrong with you? Why keep taking hits without fighting back?”

The Saintess gritted her teeth. “You ask that with full knowledge!”

“How am I asking with full knowledge?” Yang Kai was puzzled.

“I am the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land!”

“I know—so what?” Yang Kai noticed her words were oddly muddled.

“You don’t know what the Saintess cannot do?” During the pursuit she looked at Yang Kai with surprise.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

“Where did you crawl out from, you poor bastard?” The Saintess stared, astonished by his frankness. “The Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—she does not kill anyone in life!”

“Who made that rule?” Yang Kai’s face darkened; his plan seemed at risk of collapse.

“It has always been so!” the Saintess hurried to explain. “We may not take lives; if we break this taboo the cultivation methods we practice will develop flaws!”

“What kind of bullshit technique is that?” Yang Kai snapped; he had never heard of such a restrictive method.

Then again, if the restriction was so severe the technique she cultivated must indeed be powerful.

“Then why don’t you act?” The Saintess asked while they fled, eyeing him. “You look so at ease—why must I be the one to move?”

Yang Kai curled his lip, utterly resigned; it seemed he couldn’t use her to kill for him this time.

“Although I cannot strike personally, I can aid you. If you fear you cannot face them, you needn’t worry.” the Saintess said hastily.

“How will you help?”

The Saintess was silent, then suddenly released a Soul Technique that surged into Yang Kai’s Spirit Body.

Yang Kai’s face shifted; at the instant the Soul Technique seeped into him he felt a strange sensation, as if in some unseen way a bond had formed between him and the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—she appeared to have conferred something peculiar upon him, and he clearly felt his soul strength swell considerably.

Moreover, mysterious flashes crossed his mind—unknown mysteries and formulas flowed through his thoughts.

Yang Kai felt he could wield them with ease!

The feeling was bizarre and baseless, yet Yang Kai believed it without doubt.

He halted mid-pursuit, took a deep breath, and his eyes gleamed with fierce light.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s Saintess also stopped briefly behind him, eyes anxiously fixed on him.

“Where do you think you’re running to!” Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder bellowed; though these juniors were weaker, they ran swiftly—had they not stopped of their own accord the elders might not have caught up.

Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder were furious, killing intent rippling across their faces.

Yang Kai slowly turned to face them, brow furrowed, still pondering the earlier oddities.

After a long moment he raised a hand; Divine Sense energy erupted, and an enormous golden greatsword suddenly manifested in midair.

The greatsword was purely a Divine Sense manifestation, over ten zhang long, its golden blade radiating a heat capable of incinerating all.

An unparalleled oppression descended; Hai Wangu and the Cheng elder, who had been glaring fiercely at Yang Kai, shook uncontrollably. Under that pressure they felt as if a mountain pressed upon them, teetering on the verge of being crushed, their minds filled with terror and unable to muster resistance.

The Saintess trembled as well, her face showing disbelief; she stared at Yang Kai, her eyes lighting with a peculiar glow, as if she had discovered an incredible secret and felt inexplicably elated.

Yang Kai fixed his gaze on the Divine Sense greatsword, moved his mind, and the sword descended from the sky, cleaving down where the Cheng elder stood.

A violent shockwave swept through; the Cheng elder vanished beneath the blade without a sound, and Hai Wangu was blasted into the air by the force, struggling to keep his footing.

“Is that the Xuantian Sword?” Yang Kai frowned and turned to the Saintess to ask; she unconsciously nodded, “It is!”
