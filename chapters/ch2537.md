## Chapter 2537 — Enshrouded by a Strange Mist

A day later, Yang Kai, who was meditating, suddenly opened his eyes and said in a low voice, "He's here!"

Upon hearing this, Zhang Ruoxi quickly put away the Ethereal Jade Disc, then stood up and gazed into the distance.

In the distance ahead, a figure was rapidly approaching, constantly looking around as if searching for something.

Yang Kai released a trace of Divine Sense to guide him, and that person immediately sensed it and rushed straight over.

In no time at all, Old Ban appeared before Yang Kai, cupped his fists, and said, “Sorry to have kept you waiting, Young Master.”

"You're too polite, Old Ban," Yang Kai returned the gesture. "We'll be relying on you for this trip."

Old Ban smiled slightly and said, "Rest assured, with me leading the way, I guarantee you can enter the Ancient Land safely." As he spoke, his face brimmed with confidence, a stark contrast to the timid man who had been scolded and beaten by the red-clothed girl yesterday.

Yang Kai nodded to himself, thinking that Pi San's recommendation was indeed accurate. Although Old Ban's cultivation wasn't much, he definitely knew a safe route in and out of the Ancient Land, or perhaps he had grasped some kind of pattern. Otherwise, with his level of strength, how could he be so confident?

"Before entering the Ancient Land, you two should refine this first." As Old Ban spoke, he handed something to Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi.

Yang Kai took it and found that what he was given was something similar to a Sound Bead, but not quite the same as an ordinary Sound Bead. The crafting was also extremely rough, clearly not the work of a professional artificer, but rather something someone had casually made from whatever materials were at hand.

"What is this?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

Old Ban explained, "The Ancient Land passage is filled with strange mist that blocks Divine Sense and sight. If you enter without a guiding object, it's easy to get separated and lost within. This is a communication bead I made from Gui Jia Stone, a specialty of the passage. It allows you to sense each other's positions and isn't affected by the strange mist. After you refine it, you'll be able to detect my movements within the mist. However, the sensing range is only thirty zhang, so you'll need to stay close behind me."

Yang Kai understood and nodded, "Alright!"

With that, he and Zhang Ruoxi began refining the Gui Jia Beads.

These things weren't hard to refine. In less than the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi had both finished refining them. Holding them in their palms and sensing slightly, they could indeed detect the positions of the other two beads. It was extremely convenient.

Yang Kai knew Old Ban was right. With these, it would be hard for him and Zhang Ruoxi to get separated from Old Ban.

"Since you two are ready, let's set out. Before we go, I must remind you again: you must not leave my side, not even a step. If you get separated, it'll be very hard to get out." Old Ban warned solemnly, afraid Yang Kai would rely on his high cultivation and not take it seriously. He even gave an example: "Over thirty years ago, an Emperor Realm expert got lost in this strange mist and wandered for a full ten years."

"Ten years!" Yang Kai exclaimed in shock.

Old Ban nodded gravely, "That's right."

Zhang Ruoxi asked curiously, "How does Old Ban know the time so precisely?"

An Emperor Realm expert lost in the strange mist for ten years—how could anyone know? Even if Old Ban was familiar with the passage, with his low strength, could he really observe someone for ten years under the mist's interference?

Zhang Ruoxi wasn't doubting him, just curious.

Old Ban replied seriously, "Because during those ten years, I ran into that person many times in the passage. Each time, they wandered aimlessly like a lost soul. More than once, I was nearly injured by them. Luckily, I ran fast."

"What happened to that person in the end?" Zhang Ruoxi asked nervously.

Old Ban shook his head, "I don't know. Maybe they died somewhere in the passage, or maybe they escaped by chance. I haven't seen them since twenty years ago. But it seemed that after being trapped so long, her mind was a bit unclear. I vaguely noticed she was a woman."

"How pitiful!" Zhang Ruoxi sighed.

A woman, no matter how strong, was still a woman. Trapped in the strange mist for nearly ten years—how did she survive? Was she alive or dead in the end?

If she herself were trapped in the passage for ten years, what would become of her? Thinking of this, Zhang Ruoxi couldn't help but shiver.

But this was all a matter of the past. Old Ban only brought it up to make Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi act cautiously, nothing more.

"Don't worry, Old Ban. We definitely won't leave your side," Yang Kai said solemnly.

"Good, then let's go." Old Ban nodded, waved his hand, and sped toward the Ancient Land passage.

Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi followed closely behind.

During the day they waited for Old Ban, Yang Kai also took the opportunity to check out the Ancient Land passage. It seemed to be a vast canyon, its length unknown, but about a dozen li wide.

Over the past few days, many cultivators had entered the passage. Each looked confident and high-spirited, as if they were going in to seek treasure. Among them were the red-clothed girl and Elder Fu.

For the first twenty or so li of the passage, the view was still fairly open. Even though there was some strange mist, it didn't affect visibility. But the deeper one went, the denser the mist became. By fifty li in, you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.

When Yang Kai probed inside with his Divine Sense, he found it was like plunging into a mass of highly elastic cotton. His Divine Sense was completely bounced back, making it impossible to investigate deeply—he could only sense a short distance.

He had long known this strange mist was bizarre. Otherwise, so many cultivators in the Desolate City wouldn't speak of it with such dread.

Old Ban moved swiftly, not stopping for a moment. In no time, they had traveled fifty li.

By now, the three had entered the area shrouded by the strange mist.

Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi suddenly felt as if they'd fallen into a bottomless sea. Their vision was pitch black, and even their Divine Sense could only extend three zhang to the sides—no further.

Yang Kai was secretly shocked, feeling that nature truly worked wonders. Such a powerful natural barrier couldn't possibly be man-made. If this strange mist were near a Sect, it would be as effective as a grand protective array—anyone daring to invade would likely get lost within.

Though he was at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, Yang Kai's Divine Sense was no weaker than that of a Second Stage expert. Yet even he was helpless against the strange mist. How many in the entire Star Realm could perceive the dangers and secrets within?

Perhaps only experts at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm would fare differently here.

As soon as they stepped into the area covered by the strange mist, Old Ban's pace slowed. He said in a deep voice, "You two must pay close attention to the Gui Jia Beads and track my position, so you don't get separated."

"Mm." Zhang Ruoxi, following behind him, nodded emphatically.

In fact, there was no need for his reminder. The moment they entered the strange mist, Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi had already gripped their Gui Jia Beads tightly, sending a wisp of Divine Sense into them.

With the beads' guidance, even though they couldn't see anything and their Divine Sense couldn't reach far, they could still follow closely behind Old Ban.

Crackle...

Strange sounds came from beneath their feet, making one's hair stand on end, as if they were stepping on something brittle.

Curious, Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense to investigate. When he saw what was beneath his feet, he couldn't help but gasp.

The ground was covered in bleached white bones. Who knew how many corpses lay here? The weathered, brittle bones had been exposed for ages—one step and they crumbled to powder.

Yang Kai glanced at Zhang Ruoxi and found she wasn't too frightened. Though a bit tense, she wasn't scared, so he relaxed.

Zhang Ruoxi was quite adaptable.

Old Ban's voice came from ahead: "Throughout history, who knows how many heroes have died in the Ancient Land passage? The entire passage is practically paved with bones. Countless cultivators at the Dao Origin Realm and above have perished here. After death, their flesh vanishes, but their bones remain. If their Divine Soul is fortunate, it might persist. With the strange mist's eerie properties, Yin-Soul ghosts are easily born here!"

"Yin-Soul ghosts!" Zhang Ruoxi shuddered, goosebumps rising all over her.

She wasn't too afraid of stepping on bones, but the mention of Yin-Soul ghosts truly scared her.

Old Ban continued, "These Yin-Soul ghosts hide in the strange mist and occasionally attack people. This is one of the three great deadly dangers of the Ancient Land passage. Ordinary ghosts are one thing, but if you encounter a powerful Ghost General or Ghost Commander, they're extremely troublesome. Moreover... at the center of the passage, there's a Ghost King of unimaginable strength! It's said he was once a Second Stage Emperor Realm expert whose Divine Soul transformed after death. So, anyone who knows a bit about this passage will stick to the edges and never enter the center."

As Old Ban was speaking, Zhang Ruoxi suddenly cried out softly, as if startled by something.

Immediately, her Origin Qi surged, and she struck fiercely in a certain direction.

Energy surged, the momentum was terrifying. From the direction she attacked came a shrill, piercing scream, like a baby wailing at night.

The moment Zhang Ruoxi made her move, Yang Kai had already released his Divine Sense to investigate. He discovered that, at some point, a strange energy had appeared just half a foot to her right. Concealed within the mist, this energy had gathered into a twisted human face, watching her with an expression of intense curiosity.

But under Zhang Ruoxi's strike, the twisted face instantly became ferocious.

Old Ban's expression changed and he shouted, "A Yin-Soul?"

His strength was the lowest, so even if he released his Divine Sense, it was suppressed nearby and he couldn't sense what was happening on Zhang Ruoxi's side. He could only ask aloud.
