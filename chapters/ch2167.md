## Chapter 2167 — Eight Directions Returning to Origin Array

Deep within the Time Temple, at a secluded spot, many powerhouses had gathered.

This was already the deepest part of the temple. Only the very top experts of the Dao Origin Realm from the Southern Territory were qualified to come here.

Lan Xun, Xiao Chen, Luo Yuan, Kong Qi, Murong Xiaoxiao, Gong Wenshan, and Bian Yuqing were all present.

Among these seven, apart from Lan Xun being at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm and Gong Wenshan at the Second Stage, the rest all possessed the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Lan Xun needed no further introduction. As the cherished daughter of the Radiant Moon Emperor, she possessed a special constitution, and her strength could not be measured by cultivation alone. She was absolutely qualified to be here. Gong Wenshan was the same; although his cultivation was a stage lower than most present, as a master of formations, his methods were mysterious, and his strength could not be judged by cultivation either. It was no surprise he could come here.

At this moment, aside from Xiao Chen, who remained by Lan Xun’s side without leaving her for a moment, the others each found their own spot, sat cross-legged, and conserved their strength, seemingly waiting for something in silence.

Murong Xiaoxiao occasionally glanced in a certain direction, her beautiful eyes full of worry and anticipation.

Suddenly, a dozen zhang away from where everyone was, ripples surged within a circular portal of light, and then a figure slowly emerged from within.

The group noticed and all turned to look.

"Finally, everyone’s here?" Luo Yuan, apparently impatient from waiting, couldn’t help but snort coldly.

Murong Xiaoxiao immediately stood up, a smile appearing on her face as she walked over, seemingly to greet the newcomer.

The others also showed interest, wanting to see who had arrived.

The figure gradually took shape and finally stepped out of the portal, revealing their true appearance.

"Ah?" Murong Xiaoxiao’s smile froze, staring at the newcomer in astonishment, her expression extremely complicated—there was a bit of disappointment and a bit of surprise.

She hadn’t expected that the last person to come out of the portal would be Yang Kai, and not the Xiao Baiyi she had imagined!

The others also had varied expressions. Kong Qi’s face even twitched, and he quickly looked away, as if even glancing at Yang Kai would sully his eyes.

Bian Yuqing covered her mouth and smiled…

"Eh? So many people!" Yang Kai, after stepping out of the portal, immediately saw the seven figures ahead and couldn’t help but be surprised. "Why are you all waiting here?"

"We're waiting for you!" Bian Yuqing smiled charmingly.

Yang Kai rubbed his nose and said, "Don’t joke around. I’m not important enough for all of you to wait here on my account."

He thought Bian Yuqing was just teasing him.

Who would have thought…

"It's not a joke, we really are waiting for you!" Gong Wenshan also stood up at this moment, looked at Yang Kai seriously, and said, "But that’s not quite right. We’re not waiting for you specifically, but for the last person to come!"

Yang Kai frowned, looked around, and finally fixed his gaze ahead, pondering, "Looks like, to break this restriction, you don’t have enough people!"

"Exactly!" Gong Wenshan nodded.

"Can someone explain what’s going on right now?" Yang Kai smiled and looked around.

Gong Wenshan said disdainfully, "Such a troublesome matter, I don’t want to explain it twice!"

After saying that, he ignored Yang Kai.

Murong Xiaoxiao pursed her red lips and said, "I’ll explain. Junior Brother Yang, come here."

She beckoned Yang Kai over.

Yang Kai nodded and walked over.

Murong Xiaoxiao immediately began to explain to him.

After listening to her explanation, Yang Kai finally understood. At the main entrance of the hall ahead, a formation called the ‘Eight Directions Returning to Origin Array’ had been set up. This formation wasn’t particularly profound or useful, and was very easy to break.

All that was needed was eight people standing in specific positions, and the formation would break on its own, without requiring any effort from the martial artists.

Of course, if there wasn’t someone proficient in formations here, it would be hard to see the intricacies, but for Gong Wenshan, this kind of formation was hardly a challenge.

"So, you all could only wait here for the last person to arrive?" Yang Kai asked after listening.

"Yes." Murong Xiaoxiao nodded gently and smiled. "I didn’t expect Junior Brother Yang to be the last one to arrive."

Yang Kai glanced at her and said softly, "Don’t worry, Brother Xiao Bai is only slightly injured, his life isn’t in danger!"

Murong Xiaoxiao’s eyes lit up at his words. "Junior Brother Yang, you saw Senior Brother Xiao?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

"Where is he now?" Murong Xiaoxiao asked nervously.

"I don’t know, maybe he was teleported out, or maybe he’s still somewhere in the temple." Yang Kai shrugged.

Murong Xiaoxiao seemed to think of something, covered her mouth, and exclaimed softly, "Junior Brother Yang… did you defeat Senior Brother Xiao?"

"Eh?" Yang Kai was surprised. "From what you’re saying… you also went to the Platform of Discourse?"

"That’s right…" Murong Xiaoxiao replied. "I met an opponent there and only came here after defeating them."

"Looks like everyone’s experiences were pretty similar…" Yang Kai mused.

If everyone had gone through the Time Steps and the Platform of Discourse, then it made sense that only eight people were left here now.

Those two trials weren’t something just anyone could pass; the rest had probably already been eliminated.

As Yang Kai spoke, he glanced at the others and found that each of them had some kind of Star Seal on the back of their hands, even Murong Xiaoxiao.

It seemed their fortunes within the Time Temple had been quite good, whereas he himself had only obtained a single Fruit of Time upon first arriving at Two Seasons Mountain, and had found no other Star Seals at all.

"Are you done with the nonsense? If so, hurry up and get moving. I don’t have time to waste here!" Luo Yuan urged impatiently.

If breaking the formation didn’t require eight people, Luo Yuan would have already gone on a rampage and driven out the idle bystanders.

Yang Kai glanced at him but didn’t say much, only nodded to Gong Wenshan. "Brother Gong, I understand the situation now. What should we do next? Please instruct us!"

Gong Wenshan, taking charge, nodded. "In that case, everyone listen to my orders. Stand where I tell you to stand, and don’t move. Although this Eight Directions Returning to Origin Array is easy to break, if anything goes wrong… hmph…"

He didn’t finish his sentence, but everyone understood what he meant.

Xiao Chen smiled, "Brother Gong, just give the instructions. This concerns everyone, I don’t think anyone will be unreasonable."

As he spoke, he glanced at Luo Yuan, intentionally or not.

"Very good!" Gong Wenshan replied coldly, then formed seals with his hands and suddenly pushed forward.

Ripples visible to the naked eye spread out, and the Origin Qi actually materialized, forming a Heaven And Earth Seal not far in front of everyone.

Immediately, Gong Wenshan pointed and said, "Please, friend, stand at the Qian position!"

He was pointing right at Luo Yuan.

Luo Yuan was sensible enough not to say a word. He leapt and landed precisely at the spot Gong Wenshan had indicated.

"Madam, please take the Li position!" He then pointed to Bian Yuqing.

"Calling me madam makes me sound so old…" Bian Yuqing pouted, but still gracefully landed at the designated spot.

"You, take the Dui position!" Gong Wenshan pointed at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded and flew to Bian Yuqing’s side.

Next, under Gong Wenshan’s guidance, everyone took their respective positions.

In the brief lull, Bian Yuqing glanced at Yang Kai with a playful smile. “Well, well—never thought that you would make it all the way here, you little rascal!”

"What? Underestimating me?" Yang Kai raised his brows and snorted, "Protector Bian hasn’t seen what I’m capable of yet."

"Is that so…" Bian Yuqing smiled with interest, her charm on full display. "Hearing you say that, I’d like to see for myself."

"There’ll be plenty of chances!" Yang Kai shot her a look, then asked, "Where’s Senior Brother Kou? Wasn’t he with you?"

Bian Yuqing’s expression dimmed at his words.

Yang Kai exclaimed, "Don’t tell me…"

Bian Yuqing laughed, "It’s not what you think. Kou Wu knew he wasn’t strong enough and stopped at the Time Steps!"

"Oh, that’s a shame." Yang Kai sighed.

Although the Time Steps were full of dangers, if one could cross them, there were many benefits to be gained. Yang Kai knew this well—not just him, but the other seven who had arrived here were all stronger than before, clearly thanks to the Time Steps.

But what Bian Yuqing said confirmed Yang Kai’s earlier guess—everyone’s opportunities were basically the same, especially in the later stages. They all passed through the Time Steps and the Platform of Discourse to reach this place.

As the two spoke, everyone had already taken their positions, with only Gong Wenshan left.

Gong Wenshan stood outside the formation, carefully checked everyone’s positions, and, confirming there were no mistakes, gracefully leapt to the final spot.

As soon as his feet touched the ground, he suddenly shouted, "Don’t move! No matter what you feel, no matter what happens, don’t use your strength, or bear the consequences yourself!"

Seeing how serious he was, no one dared disobey. Everyone held their breath and focused, entering a state of emptiness.

Soon, a buzzing sound was heard.

The Spiritual Qi of Heaven And Earth all around seemed to rush about, triggering a chain reaction.

As these movements continued, the buzzing in the void grew louder and more frequent.

Finally, accompanied by a strange sound, it was as if something shattered, and the noise reached everyone’s ears.

Only then did the always-tense Gong Wenshan let out a sigh of relief. He knew the Eight Directions Returning to Origin Array had been broken.

Crackle…

A sound rang out, and a crack suddenly appeared in the door ahead, light shining through. Then, the door slowly moved to both sides, and the gap gradually widened.

When the gap was wide enough for a person to pass through, Gong Wenshan suddenly shouted, "Don’t move yet!"

Everyone was startled, and their previously eager bodies froze.

But at that moment, Gong Wenshan shot into the door like an arrow released from a bow.

"Damn, we’ve been tricked!" Kong Qi shouted angrily and quickly chased after him.
