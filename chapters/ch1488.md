## Chapter 1488 — Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation

Within the Fallen Emperor Mountains, in a certain mountain hollow, Yang Kai and four companions, after three days of flight, finally came to a stop here.

This was already deep within the Fallen Emperor Mountains. Before the Imperial Garden had emerged, no living being had ever been able to set foot here—the dense power of Imperial Might alone was enough to crush to dust anyone who dared trespass.

However, after the Imperial Garden manifested, the Imperial Might within the Fallen Emperor Mountains dissipated into nothingness, leaving this place without any natural defenses.

The five of them arrived with ease; along the way they had encountered no complications.

"Is it here?" Elder He turned his head and looked around, brow deeply furrowed; the others wore expressions of bewilderment.

Although the Spiritual Qi here was not poor, under everyone's Divine Sense there were absolutely no traces of any formation or restriction to be found, let alone the cave abode of an ancient martial cultivator.

"Indeed, it is exactly here." Elder Jiang, however, was full of confidence, a smile playing on his lips. "Had I not by chance been involved in a fight here back then, I would never have discovered the secret — my noticing it was nothing but luck."

"Elder Jiang, stop keeping us in suspense — where exactly is that ancient cave dwelling?" Chen the burly man, the most impatient of the group, asked eagerly.

"Far as the eye can see, yet right before you." Elder Jiang smiled slightly. "Brother Chen, strike over there once at random and you will see the clue."

The burly man sneered, raised his brows, and looked in the direction Elder Jiang pointed; there was nothing but a smooth rock wall, and even under his Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm Divine Sense he could not discern any hint.

But since Elder Jiang said it, there must be a basis. Without hesitation, the burly man let out a grunt and threw a punch.

Saint Yuan surged forth, the force of his punch nearly taking solid form. A fist shadow, dazzling with golden light, shot from his hand and smashed straight toward the cliff face.

The Saint Yuan within that man was clearly of the metal attribute — fierce and unmatched.

Yang Kai raised a brow and nodded faintly; he did not know which force the burly man came from, but from the condensation and vigor of his Saint Yuan he appeared a cut above an ordinary Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator.

Madam Yi stood smiling at his side, evidently very satisfied with her husband's strength and the bearing in his every move.

An unexpected scene unfolded: just as the punch-shadow was about to strike the wall, a ripple suddenly spread through the air. An energy membrane, invisible even to the naked eye, seemed to stand before them. The mighty fist vanished as if a brick had been smashed into the sea — it produced no stir, simply disappearing.

The next instant, an attack identical to that golden fist bizarrely appeared from the space ahead and flew directly toward the burly man's face.

An abnormality flared; the burly man yelled and hurriedly dodged.

Boom... with a single sound the golden fist shot forward one hundred zhang, blasting the nearby rocks and trees into a rain of debris.

"It can actually reflect attacks back?" The Chen elder was not alarmed but rather delighted, his eyes flashing with interest.

"Indeed. The Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation grows strong against strength and weak against weakness — I had no means to deal with it!" Elder Jiang nodded gently.

Although the burly man had been somewhat embarrassed just now, he bore no anger, and from the side said, "This formation is quite interesting. Elder Jiang, tell us — how should we break it?"

Elder Jiang gave a chuckle. "This old man is not clever, but the method to break it has indeed been worked out. If everyone cooperates we can do it. Please, come over here."

Hearing this, the others hurriedly gathered closer.

The expression on Elder Jiang’s face grew solemn at once, and he began explaining how everyone should coordinate in order to break the formation.

All present were Origin Returning Realm cultivators; though not the very best, they had trained for many years and had seen many formations. After Elder Jiang's explanation they all nodded slightly, indicating their understanding.

"Good. Since you have grasped the method, let us first recover a bit and adjust our states to the best."

They had no objections and immediately sat cross-legged, clutching Saint Crystals to recover the Saint Yuan they had expended on the journey.

After about half a day, they opened their eyes one after another, each looking vigorous and expectant.

"By the way, Young friend Yang, do you carry Spiritual Pills that can quickly replenish Saint Yuan?" Elder Jiang asked again, uneasy. Although he vaguely suspected Yang Kai came from a good background, this was a serious matter and he dared not be careless.

"I have them, Elder Jiang, rest assured," Yang Kai replied coolly.

With the vast reserves of Saint Yuan stored within him, he scarcely needed recovery pills; even if his Saint Yuan were exhausted, one drop of Golden Blood exploding would make him vigorous again.

In all the years Yang Kai had wandered, he had rarely encountered true depletion of his Saint Yuan.

"Good. Everyone should keep their recovery Spiritual Pills where they are easiest to reach. Though the Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation is not difficult to crack, it demands continuous Saint Yuan output. If you wish to enter that ancient cave, none of you may slacken."

"We know that; stop wasting time, Elder Jiang, let's begin now," Chen urged.

"All right, take your positions then, according to the plan I just explained." Elder Jiang's face turned serious and he shot off toward one direction.

The other four also sped to their respective spots; in an instant the five were arrayed at the five points of a pentagon, spaced with the precision of a ruler.

"Everyone, exert together!" Elder Jiang called, instantly unleashing his Saint Yuan and pouring it into the void before him.

The others wasted no time either; seeing him act, they all forced their own power to the surface, driving their Saint Yuan outward.

In an instant five distinct energy fluctuations of different attributes rose up. Though not exceedingly powerful individually, they were unceasing.

Yang Kai's Saint Yuan was naturally of the fire attribute. Though the cultivation method he first touched had been a Yang attribute technique, as his strength grew the attribute of his Saint Yuan shifted; now, in its blazing state, his Demonic Flame could be regarded as fire attribute.

Of course, the nature of the Demonic Flame followed the will, at times cold and at times hot, ever changing.

The burly man who had struck before was metal attribute, Madam Yi was water attribute, Elder Jiang carried wood attribute, and Elder Chen bore earth attribute.

The five elements gathered, five differently hued Saint Yuan streaming into the void; strangely they did not disperse but instead gradually drew together toward the center, as if some invisible suction was greedily devouring their Saint Yuan.

The Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation grows strong against strength and weak against weakness, capable of reflecting any attack. At its height even Void King Realm experts were helpless before it — only by assembling the full five elements could it be safely broken.

If one attempted to rely on brute force, at the very least one would need the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, or the aid of a powerful Secret Treasure or secret technique.

But the spirit formation before them had stood for who knew how many tens of thousands of years and naturally no longer possessed its prime potency.

Even so, it was not something ordinary means could dispel.

The five poured their Saint Yuan into the formation and met no rebound — first because this was not an attack, and second because everyone kept their eyes on Elder Jiang, using his output as the baseline and adjusting their own Saint Yuan accordingly. Not a drop more, not a drop less; the balance of the five elements had to be maintained. If that balance broke, the formation would immediately rebound the Saint Yuan.

Beginnings are always hardest. Seeing the other four adjusting their Saint Yuan rather well, Elder Jiang involuntarily breathed out and let down the tension he had been carrying; after all, this was a cooperative effort and a mistake by any one person would affect the others — how could he not be anxious?

Seeing the progress go smoothly, he too gradually released his suppression and increased his output.

The others naturally followed suit, not daring to slacken in the slightest.

Time passed slowly; the great quiet was such that one could hear a needle fall. As the minutes crept by, the Saint Yuan pouring from the five bodies gradually filled the central space. The five colors interwove; the five attributes generated and overcame one another in a ceaseless cycle, already beginning to flow in a clockwise motion.

With the circulation of Saint Yuan, the once-smooth, mirror-like rock wall faintly revealed the outline of a cave mouth.

The entrance to an ancient cave abode!

All five were shaken, their eyes flashing with expectation.

But the entrance remained dim and seemed about to vanish at any moment; everyone knew this was because the formation had not yet been fully broken. They immediately produced Spiritual Pills, stuffed them into their mouths, swallowed and refined them to replenish their exhausted Saint Yuan.

Yang Kai was no exception. Because his cultivation was only the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, he did not want to stand out. He casually took a few Spiritual Pills and swallowed them to keep up appearances.

In the blink of an eye another two hours passed.

All five were drenched in sweat. No cultivator could endure the long-term sustained output of Saint Yuan; even with Spiritual Pills the intake did not cover the outflow.

Yet the cave entrance still had not fully revealed itself. Although clearer than before, it was a far cry from the formation being shattered.

Realizing this, everyone's faces turned grim.

"Everyone, this is looking rather bad," Madam Yi cried out first in a sharp, worried voice.

“Brat, you’d better hold out a while longer! If you collapse now, I’ll be the first to deal with you!” the burly man surnamed Chen barked at Yang Kai. Seeing Yang Kai on the verge of collapse, he feared the young man’s Saint Yuan would run dry and ruin all their efforts at the final moment.

"No problem!" Yang Kai replied lightly.

Elder Jiang frowned, casting a worried glance at Yang Kai. He privately regretted inviting a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator to join them; he had underestimated the power of the Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation, thinking merely gathering the five elements would suffice. Who knew it would require so long? Judging by the looks of it, they would need to continue for at least several more hours.

So drawn-out a task made even him uneasy — let alone Yang Kai, who was a rank lower.

He worried inwardly that Yang Kai might not be able to hold on until the moment the formation finally broke.
