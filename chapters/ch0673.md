## Chapter 673 — So Powerful?

The burly man had only spoken casually, yet unexpectedly his words struck directly at the heart of the matter.

Yang Kai had been practicing alchemy in order to make pills for the Demon race, and not just any demons but the Ancient Demon Clan that had been forgotten by the world for thousands of years — servants of the Great Demon God!

Inside the Alchemists' Association a faint medicinal fragrance wafted everywhere; from time to time Yang Kai could even sense surges of scorching True Yuan from the side chambers, no doubt alchemists concentrating on pill-refinement.

The burly man led him to a rather secluded side chamber and then abandoned him there. “Wait here; someone will come to receive you soon,” he said.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, found a chair at random, and sat down.

The side chamber was small and sparsely furnished, giving it an empty, echoing feel.

Yang Kai waited for two full hours; just as impatience began to show on his face, hurried footsteps could be heard.

The door was pushed open and a woman with a displeased expression strode in, sizing Yang Kai up and down before asking, “You’re the one applying to join the Association?”

Yang Kai nodded, rose, and asked, “Can the examination begin now?”

“How long have you been studying alchemy?” The woman’s brow tightened; she seemed displeased and asked coldly.

“Not long. I don’t know exactly how long.”

In truth he had only actually done hands-on pill-refinement for just over a year, but if one counted the time spent learning the fundamentals, it had been several years — from the moment he acquired the True Alchemy Formula until now at least four or five years, though his study of the formula had been intermittent.

Faced with her question, he did not know how to answer.

“Playing coy!” the woman snorted, displeased that Yang Kai hadn’t given a straight answer. She dug into the Spatial Pouch at her waist, hesitating for a while before withdrawing an herb and passing it to Yang Kai. “This is a Lower-Level Heaven-Grade Cold Star Herb. Refine it into liquid for me to see.”

Yang Kai took it and blinked in surprise. “Just refine it like this?”

The woman sneered. “If you can’t even do this, then don’t bother joining the Association. Do you think the Association accepts anyone? Only alchemists of Heaven-Grade and above deserve their own jade token. Hurry up — I’m pressed for time.”

She muttered as she spoke, “My master is ridiculous. If this young brat truly just started learning, why not just kick him out and save my time!”

Yang Kai heard this and couldn’t help but let out a small, silent laugh.

He understood why the woman wore that displeased expression; his arrival had interrupted her pill-refinement.

Alchemists most detested being disturbed during refinement; her annoyance was understandable.

Yet her words and demeanor clearly showed a measure of contempt, which left Yang Kai a bit helpless.

She probably assumed he had only just begun to learn alchemy.

With that thought, Yang Kai circulated his True Yuan and wrapped it around the Cold Star Herb in his hand, letting the True Yuan permeate the herb.

Very quickly a faint, clean fragrance spread, and the woman finally reined in her disdainful expression, watching Yang Kai’s hands with concentration.

The Cold Star Herb seemed to melt, becoming liquid; under the influence of True Yuan it suspended in Yang Kai’s palm, impurities drifting away and evaporating cleanly.

In short order the Heaven-Grade Lower-Level Cold Star Herb had been refined into a vividly green liquid.

With Yang Kai’s skill in the True Alchemy Formula and his technique, refining Heaven-Grade herbs was effortless. Even without a furnace or auxiliary spirit formation, he could drive away impurities completely.

In barely more than a dozen breaths the medicinal liquid had taken form. The woman released her Divine Sense to inspect it carefully; at last a hint of surprise appeared on her pretty face as she looked at Yang Kai with astonishment.

“Is that sufficient?” Yang Kai asked.

He could have further condensed the liquid to a higher level, but he chose not to; this degree should meet her requirement.

“Tell me, what grade of pills can you refine?” the woman asked seriously, regarding Yang Kai. Only now did she realize she might have underestimated the young man’s skill and ability.

“Spirit-Grade,” he replied.

“What?” Her face changed color in disbelief as she stared at him.

“Lower-Level Spirit-Grade, sometimes it may fail.” Yang Kai added this modestly; he did not dare overstate his ability for fear of attracting attention, but even saying Lower-Level Spirit-Grade seemed to shock the woman.

“Impossible — you’re at most twenty. How could you possibly refine Spirit-Grade pills?”

“I can make one for you to see.” Yang Kai shrugged.

The woman studied him deeply, as if trying to determine whether he was boastful. After a long moment she said soberly, “Come with me. If you truly possess such ability then you’ve stepped beyond the scope of my tests.”

She herself was only an Upper-Level Mystery-Grade alchemist and had no right to test Spirit-Grade talents.

In the next side chamber the burly man Yang Kai had seen earlier was frowning, studying an alchemical text in his hand as he examined an intricate spirit formation and seemed puzzled by it.

A knock came at the door. The burly man looked up and asked, “What is it?”

“Master.” The woman called softly, “It’s about the youth who just tried to join the Association.”

“Oh? Did he pass the test?” the burly man asked.

“No.”

“If he didn’t pass, don’t bother me. Go refine pills yourself,” he replied.

The woman bit her lip then suddenly kicked the door open. Yang Kai stared in astonishment.

She strode inside with aggressive momentum. The whiskered burly man slammed the table in anger. “What conduct is this? You defied my orders — do you still regard me as your master?”

The woman snorted, hands on her hips, angry. “Master, didn’t you say that the fellow had only just begun studying alchemy?”

“Yes — what of it?”

“Then how could he refine Spirit-Grade pills? I used a Lower-Level Heaven-Grade Cold Star Herb to test him and ended up embarrassed!”

“Huh?” The burly man goggled. “He can refine Spirit-Grade pills? Impossible — you’re lying to me again, young miss!”

“I’ve already brought him here. If you doubt it, verify it yourself.” The woman motioned outward, and Yang Kai forced himself to walk in.

The burly man fixed Yang Kai with a severe gaze and barked, “You claim you can refine Spirit-Grade pills?”

Yang Kai nodded calmly.

The burly man's expression turned grave and his voice grew dark. “Boy, you must understand, this is the Alchemists' Association. No matter which faction you come from, if you spout such nonsense here you will not walk out alive!”

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, feeling a headache. All he wanted was a jade token; he hadn’t expected so much trouble.

“Forget it — I won’t take the jade token. I don’t mean to bother you. I’ll take my leave.”

“How dare you!” the burly man thundered, his voice like a bell. He sneered, “The Alchemists' Association is not someplace you can come and go from as you please. Try to back out now and it won’t help. I’ll prepare the materials and watch how you attempt to refine Spirit-Grade pills. If you can’t satisfy me, hehe…”

“I’d like to see it as well, whether you truly have this skill.” The woman sized Yang Kai up from the side.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, utterly helpless.

“Mi Na, take out your Spirit-Grade materials.” The burly man stared at Yang Kai and ordered the woman.

The woman nodded lightly and rummaged through her Spatial Pouch; soon a set of Spirit-Grade materials was arranged on the table in the room.

The burly man gestured and produced a medicine furnace the size of a human head, saying, “This is my own furnace. I collected materials for eight years and had a Saint-Grade artificer specially craft it; it greatly increases the chance of successful pill-forming. Don’t say I didn’t give you a favor. If you still can’t produce Spirit-Grade pills with this furnace, expect your head to fall!”

With that he tossed the furnace over.

Yang Kai caught it casually, weighed it in his hand, and nodded with satisfaction.

The furnace’s quality was indeed excellent, superior to ordinary furnaces, and the spirit formation engraved within could assist the pill-forming chance. Yet Yang Kai keenly noticed the spirit formation was incomplete and could not exert its full effect.

“There are materials for five Spirit-Grade pills here. If you can make three, I’ll consider you to have passed the test. If not, hehe!” The burly man sneered and signaled, “Begin. I’ll be watching; don’t try any tricks.”

By now Yang Kai could not back down. He set the furnace on the table and inspected the five sets of materials carefully.

After a moment he frowned and swapped the positions of several of the herbs.

The burly man and the woman regarded him suspiciously, unsure why he appeared so confident and why he casually rearranged the carefully selected materials.

Neither of them said more; they simply watched silently.

After a short time Yang Kai began. With consummate skill he added each material into the furnace; True Yuan was poured in, medicinal liquids condensed, and both timing and flame were handled with perfect precision.

The burly man and the woman brightened as they watched.

The very way he took hold of things made them realize this young man might truly have talent — he was not merely boasting. His technique and confidence clearly came from practice.

One by one the ingredients were added to the furnace, and under Yang Kai’s control the side chamber gradually filled with the scent of medicine.

The burly man and the woman stared unblinking at Yang Kai, their expressions growing serious, the previous disdain gone.

In the time it takes to burn an incense stick Yang Kai slapped the furnace; a round, golden pill shot out from the furnace. The burly man’s reflexes were quick; he inhaled and caught the pill in his palm.

He examined it carefully, eyes widening as he exclaimed, “Indeed, a Spirit-Grade pill.”

“This young man is that formidable?” Mi Na was dumbfounded; she had not expected Yang Kai to actually produce a Spirit-Grade pill. Though it was only a Lower-Level Spirit-Grade pill, it was something she herself could not achieve.

“The medicinal properties are restrained, no wastage of materials; it’s only missing a small bit before the Pill Patterns would form. Remarkable.” The burly man sighed, sounding somewhat regretful.
