## Chapter 1290 — Breaking the Encirclement

A few Yin-Souls were not powerful; struck by Yang Kai's attack, they dissipated in an instant, but in doing so Yang Kai's figure was inevitably exposed, drawing the notice of the four over there.

The four were all startled, their faces grave as they looked this way, and they saw Yang Kai standing there with a trace of helplessness and embarrassment.

The two men among them naturally looked displeased, for they were trapped inside the restriction formation while an outsider prowled about outside; suspicion sprung up at once. They immediately ceased their actions and turned to glare at Yang Kai with hostile expressions.

The two women were momentarily taken aback when they saw Yang Kai, but before long Shen Shitao and the other delicate-looking woman both recognized his face.

How could Shen Shitao forget the man who had brought her such great benefit? Her face lit with delight and she raised a jade-like hand to beckon, "So it was you."

The delicate woman offered Yang Kai a slight smile, her expression unbearably sweet.

Yang Kai felt a headache coming on, yet he had to feign surprise and, feigning uncertainty, asked, "You are…?"

Shen Shitao covered her mouth with a coquettish laugh, her eyes like silk: "What, Brother Yang don't recognize me? I am Shen Shitao of the Qiantian Sect; we met in the Flowing Flame Sandland."

"Flowing Flame Sandland?" At the mention of it, the two men beside Shen Shitao both stiffened and once more scrutinized Yang Kai.

After all, those who could come out of the Flowing Flame Sandland alive were not to be taken lightly. The two had missed that opportunity for various reasons and had long regretted it; later they learned Shen Shitao and the others had gained great benefits there and regretted it all the more. Their understanding of the Flowing Flame Sandland, however, came only from Shen's descriptions. Now, seeing a cultivator who had safely returned from it, they naturally paid closer attention.

But once they detected that Yang Kai possessed only the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, one of them gave a barely noticeable sneer and no longer paid him much mind, as if thinking Yang Kai had only been active in the First Layer and so posed no threat.

The other man, whose cultivation was a bit lower but who looked spirited with bright eyes, was instead more interested in Yang Kai.

His cultivation was the same as Yang Kai's: both were Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, and naturally comparison sprang to mind.

Seeing Shen Shitao act as if she were well acquainted, Yang Kai felt even more vexed. He had known this woman was troublesome the last time they met, yet he had still underestimated how forward she could be. With such warmth, he could only smile and say, "So it's you — I remember now."

"Finally you remember me. I thought Brother Yang had so many noble acquaintances you'd forget ordinary people like me," Shen Shitao giggled as if very pleased. Trapped inside the formation, she still laughed and flirted, leaving the other three utterly astonished.

Hearing her, Yang Kai could only laugh awkwardly to appease her.

After a moment of laughter, Shen Shitao's bright eyes turned to Yang Kai and she asked, "By the way, Brother Yang, how did you end up here?"

"I wandered in by accident. It struck me as odd, so I came to have a look. I didn't expect to hear some movement here; I didn't reveal myself right away, please forgive me!" Yang Kai offered a slight salute.

"Wandered in by accident…" Shen Shitao smiled meaningfully and looked Yang Kai up and down. Though she did not truly believe his words, she did not press the matter; instead she shifted her gaze and asked, "I take the liberty — could I trouble Brother Yang for a favor?"

"What favor?" Yang Kai felt his scalp prickle; he knew trouble was coming.

"Could you and your companion attack the formation from the outside? It has a rebound effect; we inside can scarcely move, but I reckon attacking from the outside should be fine."

Yang Kai hesitated a moment and looked toward Yang Yan, who gave him a faint nod.

Only then did Yang Kai nod and say, "Of course."

Shen Shitao's pretty face brightened. She hurried, "Thank you, Brother Yang. Once we're freed, I'll come thank you in person."

"It's nothing," Yang Kai waved a hand. He asked them to stand back a little, then produced the Hundred Mountains Painting and summoned image after image of mountain peaks to slam into the formation.

He did not use his own Saint Yuan, mainly because he didn't want to reveal too much to outsiders. The Hundred Mountains Painting was a secret treasure, so others could not deduce anything from his attack.

One phantom mountain after another thundered down with overwhelming force. As Shen Shitao had surmised, that rebound formation only affected those trapped inside; attacking from the outside did not trigger the recoil.

Under Yang Kai's assault, that semi-circular energy shield soon grew precarious and began to crack, its color growing faint; it would likely be broken within the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.

Shen Shitao and the delicate woman could not help but feel encouraged. After all, the four had been trapped here for two days; although they might have forced the formation in another day or two, help now was naturally far preferable and would spare them lingering in this ghostly place.

The male cultivator of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm suddenly asked in a low voice, "Sister Shen, do you know this man?"

Shen Shitao pondered briefly and then honestly shook her head, "Not well — I've only seen him twice in the Flowing Flame Sandland. But he's an interesting fellow."

"Interesting?" The male looked puzzled, unable to understand the meaning behind Shen Shitao's remark. Before he could probe further, the other energetic man interjected, "Sister Tao, did you say he also went into the Flowing Flame Sandland before?"

"Yes, I met him in the Flowing Flame Sandland. Hmm… he was only First Stage of the Saint King Realm when he went in; now he's Second Stage. It seems he did indeed gain some opportunity," Shen Shitao's eyes brightened as if at a discovery.

"A First Stage daring to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland — truly reckless!" The man who had spoken earlier snorted coldly, showing disdain. "If he came out alive, he's simply been lucky. He probably only operated on the outskirts of the First Layer."

For some reason the man seemed to look down upon Yang Kai; though he had only just met him, he was eager to belittle him before Shen Shitao.

Shen Shitao smiled and shook her head, "He wasn't just active on the First Layer's periphery; he passed through the First Layer. I encountered him in the Second Layer."

"He passed the First Layer?" The male's face registered shock. He had heard that the Flowing Flame Sandland's First Layer, the Heat-Flame Zone, wasn't the hardest to pass but was nonetheless perilous; many cultivators with impure Saint Yuan or insufficient preparation at the Second Stage had been stopped. How could a man who had been First Stage have the ability to get through?

He stared in disbelief.

"Of course — Junior Sister Lü Ying was there too. If you don't believe it, you can ask her," Shen Shitao said, pointing to the delicate woman at her side.

The woman called Lü Ying nodded repeatedly, confirming Shen Shitao's words.

"However… Senior Brother Wang, you weren't entirely wrong; his luck is indeed quite good," Shen Shitao said with a meaningful smile.

"Luck is not strength," the cultivator surnamed Wang slowly shook his head. "Sister Shen, haven't you heard the saying that extremes eventually reverse? If everything were dependent on luck, we wouldn't need to cultivate."

Shen Shitao gave an indulgent look. Wang then turned to the other man and asked, "Junior Brother, do you think Senior Brother's point holds weight?"

"Yes, Senior Brother is right," the man who shared Shen Shitao's surname and bore a passing resemblance to her nodded vigorously, not hesitating. Still, he smiled at Yang Kai and asked Shen Shitao, "Sister Tao, is this the fellow you mentioned last time?"

"Yes!" Shen Shitao lightly inclined her head.

"So it's him — then I should make friends with him properly," the man said.

He clearly had already received information about Yang Kai from Shen Shitao and, like her, was very interested in Yang Kai.

Seeing the pair behave as they did, Wang snorted and fell silent.

Outside, Yang Kai's brow twitched slightly; his expression remained indifferent.

Although the voices inside were low, his Divine Sense was strong — how could he not hear them? Every word of their conversation reached him, and he inwardly cursed his curiosity for having brought him here. Not only was he being used as a laborer, he had also drawn another's attention.

Still, the fact that these four had appeared here suggested they had other business; they might not want to tangle with him, and might even be hoping he'd leave sooner rather than later.

Thinking that, Yang Kai felt much more at ease. He concentrated the Hundred Mountains Painting's power and continued to batter the formation.

After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, with a gargantuan phantom mountain crashing down, the restriction trapping Shen Shitao and the others finally reached its limit and began to shatter, cracking inch by inch.

Seeing this, Yang Kai withdrew the phantom peaks and stored the Hundred Mountains Painting away, then stood waiting in place.

Shen Shitao and the others stepped out from the trapped space with smiles all around and approached Yang Kai.

As they drew near, a pleasant scent wafted over, lifting the spirits. Shen Shitao smiled and said, "Thank you for your help freeing us, Brother Yang; I am truly grateful."

"It was nothing, Miss Shen," Yang Kai waved a hand and was about to exchange a few polite words before taking his leave, but out of the corner of his eye he saw Yang Yan slip out silently to search the area where the formation had been.
