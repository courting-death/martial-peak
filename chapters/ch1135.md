## Chapter 1135 — Total Annihilation

In the mist-shrouded formation, the five remaining members of the Xu Family were on the verge of losing their minds.

They knew the formation enclosing them spanned only a thousand zhang, yet no matter how they ran or struck, they could not break free from the pall of fog.

It felt as if they were trapped circling endlessly within that thousand-zhang radius!

What filled them with the deepest despair was that even the Star Shuttle could not be used, nor could they fly through the air; a mysterious force within the fog would press anyone attempting to rise three zhang downwards.

“Vermin, crawl out and face me in single combat—hiding your head and tail won’t save you!” Xu Zhikun roared with hair-raising fury, his eyes blazing red.

He had been tormented to the point of utter frustration, his patience completely spent. Now he only wanted to fight Yang Kai head-on—live or die, it would be better than being trapped in this fog, unable to find his way.

“Old fool, you dare call yourself my opponent?” Yang Kai laughed loudly, every syllable laced with contempt.

To be honest, Yang Flame’s formation had surprised him immensely; Yang Kai was in a splendid mood and couldn’t care less about Xu Zhikun’s taunts.

“I surrender, I surrender! I’m not of the Xu Family—I’m merely a Guest Elder they hired, please let me go.” A sallow-faced elder cried out, begging.

Trapped in the formation for this time, his spirit had been tormented, and he knew that if things continued he would surely die; begging like this made him appear dishonorable and shameful, but what was honor when one’s life hung by a thread?

“Guest Elder Huo, you…” Xu Zhikun’s frantic voice sounded, “you disappoint me. The Xu Family has treated you well all these years—why speak such humiliating words?”

The Guest Elder Huo looked sheepish; though embarrassed he still shouted loudly, “From today onward I am no longer a Guest Elder of the Xu Family. Their affairs are none of mine—please, friends, let me go. I can serve you in the future; I am also Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, my strength is not weak.”

“Hm, I’ll consider it,” came Yang Kai’s voice.

“You seek death!” Xu Zhikun roared, his long staff striking viciously at the Guest Elder Huo—he knew now was the worst time for wavering hearts. If the five of them kept to themselves they might last longer, but once infighting began Yang Kai could pick them off one by one.

He hated cowards like the Guest Elder Huo to the bone; of course he wanted to kill him quickly.

The Guest Elder Huo wasn’t a fool either; as Xu Zhikun and he clashed he loudly professed loyalty to Yang Kai, hoping to be spared while the two of them fought.

The three other Xu Family experts froze, momentarily at a loss what to do.

At that moment Yang Kai’s voice rang out again: “Whoever kills Xu Zhikun, I will spare!”

Those three, thrown into confusion, suddenly revealed murderous intent—two of them leapt into the fray at once, shouting, “Brother Huo, I’ll help you!”

The remaining man was an elder of the Xu Family proper and would not be swayed by Yang Kai’s words; he joined the fight alongside Xu Zhikun, attacking the three Guest Elders of other surnames.

In an instant, within the mist-enshrouded formation, the five surviving Xu Family members split into two camps, producing their secret treasures and fighting desperately.

Yang Kai sneered and leisurely stepped out of the formation to the outside.

A retching sound came, and Yang Kai looked toward it, speechless.

Yang Flame could not stand such slaughter any longer. Although others could not see clearly through the fog, as the one maintaining the formation how could she not?

No one knew how long she vomited; her face was deathly pale. Wu Yi stood beside her, gently patting her back.

Seeing Yang Kai come out, Wu Yi shot him a glance. “If you’re going to kill, just kill—why make it so disgusting?”

“This is what you call disgusting…” Yang Kai didn’t even know what to say. All he’d done was burn people to death—how was he supposed to describe those scenes of severed limbs and shattered flesh flying everywhere, entrails scattered across the ground? If Yang Flame ever saw something like that, her very soul would probably flee in terror.

“You’re truly devious, letting them turn on each other.” Wu Yi bit her lip and smiled, all charms unleashed—several men who had followed her nearby watched with eyes wide.

She held little affection for the Xu Family; it mattered not to her if they all died.

“Those who provoke me never fare well.” Yang Kai snorted coldly, glanced at Yang Flame’s face, and casually put a pill into her mouth.

“I don’t care…” Yang Flame swallowed the pill weakly and looked at Yang Kai with little strength. “Quickly gather plenty of materials—I want to set up a killing formation. I won’t host formations to help you kill enemies anymore…”

“Understood. Wu Yi, help her inside to rest—she’s no use here.”

“Mm.” Wu Yi nodded and supported Yang Flame into the cave.

“Brother Yang, how many of them are left?” Yu Feng hurried over, excitedly asking; the dozens of warriors who originally belonged to the Haike Family also looked to him expectantly.

This time the Xu Family had brought their elite—over a dozen warriors. They expected a fierce battle and assumed everyone here might die.

They never imagined they wouldn’t need to fight; the Xu Family had been nearly wiped out already. One by one their spirits soared—staying here seemed more promising than remaining with the Haike Family. They felt elated at having left the family to follow Wu Yi.

The family life couldn’t compare to this place.

In the family, entering training grounds required paying Saint Crystals; without those crystals one had to render family contributions earned by completing tasks.

But here, among the hundreds of stone chambers, each one had a small Spirit Gathering Formation. Beside every formation were piles of Saint Crystals, allowing them to cultivate within the chambers without a single worry.

In terms of efficiency and speed it was far better than the family training grounds.

The stone chambers were also laid with refined formations—once the stone door closed there was not a whisper; no one’s Divine Sense could penetrate in.

The future looked bright!

Moreover, the entire Dragon Lair Mountain contained a large spirit formation; given enough time the Spiritual Qi here would only grow richer and more abundant. Dozens of people felt their hearts bubble with joy—those who had despaired at leaving the family now saw far better prospects here.

Even if driven away now, they would not leave; they were resolved to remain and follow Wu Yi for life.

They also knew Wu Yi had allied herself with Yang Kai—following Wu Yi was, in effect, following Yang Kai.

Among them Yu Feng was the most proud; Yang Kai had been the one he personally retrieved from the Starry Sky. Had he not discovered that blood-red crystal by chance, none of this would have happened.

Hearing Yu Feng’s question, Yang Kai replied, “Five remain.”

Immediately after those words, a miserable scream came from within.

“Only four left,” Yang Kai added.

The Xu Family head Xu Zhikun and one remaining Xu elder faced off against three Guest Elders of other surnames—no one held back. In a brief moment one Guest Elder was cut down: it was the Huo warrior who had loudly proclaimed he would switch sides.

Yang Kai hated fence-sitters like that most—if they died, it was of no consequence.

Xu Zhikun’s strength was indeed considerable—far greater than Xu Zhishen earlier. No wonder Wu Yi had said he was about to break into the Origin Returning Realm; given another year or so he might have done so.

But now he had no chance.

A moment later, another miserable scream rang out—it was the last remaining elder of the Xu Family. Though Xu Zhikun’s strength was formidable, he had yet to reach the Origin Returning Realm. Earlier, he had forced himself to take injuries in order to slay the Guest Elder surnamed Huo, and now the final elder had also been killed under the combined assault of those two Guest Elders.

Xu Zhikun erupted with rage, blood spouting from his mouth; his power surged, his momentum swelling. He swung his long staff, light streaming in great waves, forcing the two Guest Elders back step by step.

Without Yang Flame maintaining it, the scenes inside the formation were indistinct even to Yang Kai—he could only judge by the sounds of battle. Though his World-Ending Demon Eye could see through the formation, he did not use it; there was no need.

As Yang Flame rested in the cave, the fog that had covered the thousand-zhang area gradually dissipated.

A moment later, when the fog had fully vanished, Yang Kai and Yu Feng and the others saw Xu Zhikun strike down the last Guest Elder with a single staff blow.

Corpses lay all around. The Xu Family had brought over a dozen Saint King Realm warriors; in the end only Xu Zhikun remained standing, proudly alone amid the carnage, bloodied and missing an arm—pitiful to behold.

Only then did he seem to realize the formation that had trapped him had failed. Staring at the corpses around him, Xu Zhikun glared at Yang Kai with murderous hatred and leapt toward him, shrieking hysterically, “Vermin, taste death!”

A fierce aura exploded forth. Yu Feng, standing beside Yang Kai, changed expression and shouted as he retreated.

Yang Kai remained motionless; his own aura spread to confront Xu Zhikun. The two forces collided like two invisible storms, producing cracking sounds in midair. Xu Zhikun’s charge faltered—he spat blood and then surged forward with even greater speed.

“Hmph!” Yang Kai’s expression turned cold. His Divine Sense flared, instantly ripping Xu Zhikun’s Sea of Consciousness defenses apart and flooding into his mind as he took a step and drove a punch.

Unparalleled force erupted—an invisible fist struck Xu Zhikun’s rushing body. The Xu Family head froze mid-leap as if blocked by an unseen wall and could move no further.

A deathly pallor flushed with an unnatural redness across his face. He widened his eyes and glared at Yang Kai, howling, “Yingyue Hall will not spare you!”

As the words fell, his body suddenly exploded, torn into pieces—blood and severed limbs rained from the air.
