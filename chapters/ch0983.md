## Chapter 983 — Great Beauty, Little Beauty

Standing on the meteorite, Yang Kai's face lit with excitement as he looked around left and right.

Traces of life were everywhere!

There were even signs of life on this meteorite!

Yang Kai was beside himself with excitement; he had been drifting into uncertainty, not knowing which way to go, but at this most crucial moment he found information that invigorated him.

His gaze instantly hardened, the earlier daze gone, and he began to carefully examine those traces.

The meteorite he stood on was nearly the size of a small mountain, and many other meteorites of varying sizes lay scattered nearby, gathering into a sea of meteorites that, driven by the starry sky storm, drifted boundlessly through the starry sky.

This huge meteorite bore many pits and hollows that were not naturally formed; rather they looked like aftereffects of energy collisions, and there were also neat cuts as if made by blades.

Someone had fought here!

Yang Kai understood at once, and judging from those marks the battle had not occurred long ago—perhaps ten-odd days, perhaps one or two months, at most no more than three months, otherwise the raging starry sky storm would have smoothed them away.

He could almost picture the scene of that fierce battle; the most surprising thing was that the fighters' power did not seem very high.

That put one of his worries to rest—being new here he had feared running into an overwhelmingly powerful expert.

His gaze passed over the oncoming starry sky storm as he looked deeper into the starry sky, then he guided the Star Shuttle and sped off in the opposite direction of the storm.

The starry sky storm had come from that direction, which meant the lifeforms who had fought on the meteorite might still be over there.

Though the odds were slim, it was worth a try.

Yang Kai flew at full speed, his divine sense stretched to the utmost so as not to miss any meteorite he passed by.

From those meteorites he indeed found some traces; all signs indicated he was drawing ever closer to the lifeforms he was tracking.

He urged the Star Shuttle on with increasing exertion.

After who knew how long, as he passed through a stretch of dark, icy starry sky, the scene ahead suddenly brightened and he stared forward in astonishment.

Ahead, within the vast starry sky, another boundless starry void unfolded before his eyes.

The starry sky was beautiful—countless stars glittered with a moving radiance, brimming with vitality; he seemed to have arrived at the other side of the starry sky, where the beauty here stood in stark contrast to the deathly stillness on the other side.

One by one, stars great and small had been born in this starry void since ancient times, and they displayed a peculiar order as they orbited and spun around a certain point.

Multicolored light illuminated the entire starry void.

Some stars burned like fire, emitting searing power; Yang Kai had no doubt that the latent might within such a star would make any lifeform hesitate to approach.

Anyone who approached it would be melted.

That scorching power flowed into Yang Kai's body yet made him feel indescribably comfortable—that was the force of Yang attribute.

Other stars were ice-cold through and through, like gigantic ice spheres; swirling chill clung to those frozen stars, forming an ice-cold field visible to the naked eye for hundreds of thousands of li around them.

That field seemed poised to freeze the whole universe.

Still others were jade-green and unlike the neighbouring stars; they were umbrella-shaped rather than spherical, appearing like colossal trees that radiated a rich wood attribute aura.

They rose like enormous trees, standing proudly in the starry sky.

Yang Kai's head swam at the dazzling sight; his eyes could not take it all in.

He at last witnessed firsthand the wonders of a starry void.

The vast energies radiating from different stars converged within the broad starry void, making the Spiritual Qi contained there incomparably dense.

Compared with this, any Sacred Land on the Tongxuan Continent seemed utterly insignificant.

Cultivating here for a year could even be worth several to over ten times the time spent cultivating elsewhere.

Yang Kai's pores involuntarily opened; he closed his eyes and greedily drew in the Spiritual Qi that suffused his surroundings, his flesh and blood squirming and his expression full of joy.

He even felt the urge to seclude himself here and cultivate for a time, though he knew the idea was impractical; still, he was reluctant to give up such abundant energy.

Just as he hesitated, his extended divine sense suddenly detected the sign of a lifeform intruding.

Yang Kai swiftly retracted his divine sense, opened his eyes, and looked toward that direction with delight.

He found them; they seemed to have noticed him too, because the moment he withdrew his divine sense two other divine senses of equal strength spread out.

Two people! And their power was not very high—only in the Saint Realm, around the Second to Third Stage.

After all, this was a starry void—by chance meeting two people it was not unusual that they were Saint-Stage cultivators; Yang Kai felt some awe, but their cultivation level also reassured him, since even if they meant him harm he would not be without means to resist.

With that in mind, Yang Kai hastened the Star Shuttle and flew toward where they were.

Having finally encountered two people, Yang Kai naturally wouldn't miss the chance to gather information—ideally to learn where lifeforms were gathering.

To his surprise, as he drew near the two, they also seemed to be quickly flying toward this side.

This made Yang Kai somewhat wary.

Given their cultivation they should have perceived his strength; if they harboured ill intent this would easily explain their movements.

Yang Kai did not retreat, but approached with caution, because he urgently needed a guiding light.

After a moment, a green light appeared ahead, very similar to the Star Shuttle's glow.

Yang Kai halted; the green light likewise stopped not far from him, and the next moment two pairs of bright, beautiful eyes both sized him up.

Only then did Yang Kai realise that those who had intruded into his divine sense were in fact two women.

Both wore pristine white dresses, their demeanours serene and their looks quite pleasing; their figures were graceful, and on their full chests the same sword-shaped emblem was carved, indicating they were from the same faction.

The two of them were standing together on a single Star Shuttle.

Yang Kai watched for a while and nodded inwardly—the Bone Race leader Ke Luo had been right: in a starry void Star Shuttles were not rare, after all they were travel Secret Treasures and therefore common.

However, their Star Shuttle was clearly superior to his, both in the materials used to forge it and in the energy fluctuations emanating from within.

Yang Kai guessed that Star Shuttles indeed had grades; he adopted a harmless demeanour, nodded slightly at the two women and greeted, "Hello."

The woman standing in front nodded lightly, her pretty face showing some caution as she regarded Yang Kai, though since his cultivation was lower she did not appear overly alarmed.

The younger-looking woman behind her scanned Yang Kai with curious eyes, her gaze bold and impudent, full of mischief.

"Sister, is he from over there?" the little beauty asked softly. "I don't think I've seen him before."

"His cultivation is too low, he probably isn't," the great beauty said slowly, shaking her head. "But we should still be careful."

"Mm." The little beauty nodded vigorously.

"Hello!" they said simply; the great beauty parted her lips. "It's like this—we approached with no ill intent, we only want to ask a favour, so please don't be too nervous."

"Oh?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and grinned. "I'm not nervous—coincidentally, I also want to ask you for a favour."

"You want our help too?" the great beauty's dark brows drew into a line.

"Mm." Yang Kai smiled slightly. "Since everyone has needs, how about we help each other? Of course, within our own limits—no forcing the other."

He truly feared owing others favours, so the proposal appealed to him.

The great beauty turned to the younger woman and whispered; after a moment she replied at once, "All right."

"Tell me first—what do you want me to help with?" Yang Kai took the initiative, in high spirits.

"Could you let us copy a version of your Star Chart?" the great beauty asked.

"Star Chart?" Yang Kai was taken aback. "What Star Chart?"

"What else could a Star Chart be?" the great beauty frowned, feeling Yang Kai's words strange. "You don't have a Star Chart?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

"Who are you kidding?" the little beauty cried from behind the Star Shuttle. "How could you come here without a Star Chart? Don't think we're easy to bully just because we're women."

She chattered angrily, a look of incredulity on her face, even waving a small pink fist at Yang Kai as if convinced he was lying.

"I haven't bullied you, have I?" Yang Kai said in surprise.

"You don't have the means—be careful or I'll beat you, take your Star Chart, and teach you a lesson," the little beauty snorted.

"He Miao!" the great beauty called sharply.

The little beauty pouted, "Sister, he looks like a decent sort, yet he's full of lies—maybe he's from over there, here to stall us."

Hearing that, the great beauty's face showed a flicker of vigilance as she sized Yang Kai up; she then bellowed, "I don't care whether you're from there—right now I want your Star Chart, I'll buy it! Are ten Lower-Level Saint Crystals enough?"

As she spoke, a bracelet on her wrist flashed with splendour, and in her delicate hand ten translucent Saint Crystals appeared.

"Sister, our Saint Crystals are already few," the little beauty cried, her eyes full of pain; those ten Lower-Level Saint Crystals were a considerable sum to her.

Yang Kai's face remained calm, but he was inwardly stunned.

It wasn't that she produced ten Saint Crystals so casually that shocked him, but the bracelet she wore.

If he wasn't mistaken, that bracelet should be a space Secret Treasure!
