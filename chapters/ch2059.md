## Chapter 2059 — Seedling

The birth of the Incarnation was steeped in coincidence, and its strength likewise owed much to fate.

If not for the second Stone Puppet's lack of innate wisdom, Yang Kai would never have thought to pour a strand of his Soul Incarnation into it, making it his own Incarnation. And if not for a small stroke of fortune within the Floating Continent, the Incarnation would never have grown so swiftly.

Because it had been refined from an entire Floating Continent, it could grow to such a terrifying level in a short time.

When that punch landed, the force the Incarnation wielded was equivalent to the power of a continent—an entire world.

Even though Yang Kai's physical body was strong and his Realm considerable, how could mere flesh and blood withstand the bombardment of a continent?

Being sent flying, even suffering injuries from it, was not surprising.

"You should get me a stick like Xiaoxiao's!" the Incarnation grinned.

If he had a Heaven-Shaking Pillar or the like, the Incarnation, even without using other powers, could easily beat ten opponents at once! Moreover, he could do it even better than Xiaoxiao.

"There will be a chance!" Yang Kai agreed, then his figure blurred as he suddenly appeared above the Incarnation; his body turned and a Whip Kick swept down.

On that leg, Origin Qi raged; Yang Kai showed no mercy.

The Incarnation, upon seeing this, remained calm, raising one hand to block overhead, while the other great hand swept from under its armpit, five fingers spread like a mountain, reaching to seize Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and he shouted, "Condense!"

As the word fell, the surrounding space, affected by the Power of the Laws, suddenly grew rigid with a humming sound.

The Incarnation's movements faltered. Its vast body encountered a tremendous hindrance; the hand reaching for Yang Kai no longer moved with its former speed.

His body sank and he gave a low roar: "Break!"

From the giant frame erupted, in an instant, a burst of savage qi.

Crackling sounds rang out...

The brittle noises spread, and the solidified space loosened.

Relying on brute strength of body, it actually tore through the Spatial Law suppression Yang Kai had deployed and continued to reach for him.

Yang Kai dared not advance any further; he stamped, the soles of his feet producing explosive snaps as his body shot back like an arrow loosed from a bow. Immediately his hands opened and closed, and a massive Moon Blade formed in his grasp and was released.

The huge Moon Blade was black as ink, like a curved knife, slashing toward the Incarnation's arm.

The Incarnation's gaze hardened. It changed the grab into a fist and struck out with a force like a fierce tiger.

The savage punch thrust through the air. Before the Moon Blade could fall, the two met midair with a thunderous roar; the Moon Blade vanished and the punch's force dissipated.

Before Yang Kai could fully react, the Incarnation stamped its feet and from the earth a column of soil shot up; the Incarnation seized it, and the gathered column flashed with a streak of light, instantly hardening like iron into an earthen staff.

With a grab and a swing, that more-than-ten-zhang-long earthen staff rushed at Yang Kai through the void with a shrill boom, as if wanting to pierce the space itself.

Yang Kai's expression changed; he dared not remain, and with spatial power surrounding him he flickered aside so the staff struck empty air.

"Heh heh heh!" The Incarnation, as if expecting this, showed no alarm; with a strange laugh it suddenly bent, both giant hands pressed to the ground, and the earth trembled and hummed.

Beneath Yang Kai, a spray of writhing earthen dragons exploded forth, vivid and lifelike, baring fangs and claws as they swarmed to attack him; counting roughly, there were more than a dozen, cutting off all his retreat.

"Dragon Transformation!" Yang Kai called, unleashing the Golden Sacred Dragon's primordial power within him; his right arm swelled, the arm covered in a layer of energy-dragon scales, his hand forming into a dragon's claw.

He twisted and plunged into the mass of earthen dragons.

Soon snarls and explosions sounded; the earthen dragons broke apart and crumbled, and amid the choking dust Yang Kai's figure, like a descending deity, shot out.

On his body, resplendent clouds bloomed; streams of Five-Elements sword qi furiously fired toward the Incarnation.

The Incarnation sneered and, stamping once, caused an earthen wall to rise before it; like the earthen staff, its surface flashed and became extremely solid.

Hisss...

The sword qi crashed against the earthen wall but could not break through; it was all resisted by that defensive layer.

When the sword qi was exhausted, the Incarnation waved a hand and the wall collapsed in a thunderous heap.

But before it could act further, Yang Kai suddenly revealed a strange smile, and a golden light blossomed at his left eye.

"Not good!" the Incarnation yelped, trying to wrench his gaze away in haste—but it was already too late. The instant he caught that thread of golden light, his attention was ensnared, unable to think of anything else. His eyes went dull and vacant, utterly transfixed.

After a moment the golden light faded and the Incarnation snapped back to its senses.

Yang Kai stood before it with a rueful look; the two stared at each other for a moment, then burst into boisterous laughter.

After a long while, the laughter gradually subsided.

"Make sure today's matter doesn't get out," Yang Kai warned solemnly.

The Incarnation straightened and nodded in earnest agreement.

The thought of fighting himself, exhausting every trick and ability and finally using the World-Ending Demon Eye to gain a sliver of advantage, would make anyone laugh their teeth out if it spread.

Yet from this he could somewhat determine the Incarnation's capabilities.

With his current measures, aside from Divine Sense suppression, there was no good way to deal with it. The Incarnation's Divine Sense being weaker than his own was natural — it was but a sliver of his Soul Incarnation; how could it compare to his true main spirit?

Using soul suppression against it was cheating...

It’d be no different from ordering him to lie there and let Yang Kai pummel him.

Yang Kai thought how humiliating that sounded.

"Do you have any spare Secret Treasures?" the Incarnation suddenly asked.

"I do." Yang Kai nodded, eyeing it suspiciously, but with a thought he understood why the Incarnation wanted Secret Treasures and exclaimed in surprise, "The Heaven Devouring Battle Art can even devour Secret Treasures?"

The Incarnation said, "I'm only guessing; whether it can must be tested."

Hearing this, Yang Kai nodded, rummaged in his Spatial Ring, and pulled out several Secret Treasures to toss to it.

These Secret Treasures came from Shentu's people; earlier spoils had already been taken by Yang Kai to Fenglin City's black market in exchange for Source Crystals.

After taking those Secret Treasures, the Incarnation sat down, held them in its palm and rumbled, "The seed seems to have sprouted."

Yang Kai was stunned, but quickly understood what the Incarnation meant; a pleased expression crossed his face and his figure vanished from where he stood.

When he reappeared, he was already near the herb garden.

Only two things now grew in the herb garden: the Everlasting Tree Yang Kai had obtained in his homeland Star Domain years ago, and the gold-and-silver Wood Seed he had planted in a corner.

Yang Kai had tried to refine the Everlasting Tree but could not; in the end he transplanted it into the Small Xuan Realm's herb garden.

Because of the Everlasting Tree's presence, the Small Xuan Realm's herb garden had become teeming with vitality.

Yang Kai had once asked Yang Yan how to refine the Everlasting Tree to achieve an undying body.

Yang Yan had not spoken plainly, leaving him helpless.

The Wood Seed had come from the slain Mu Xiao. Because the seed was peculiar and could not even be burned by Liu Yan, Yang Kai kept it.

Not yet a year had passed, and the Wood Seed had already taken root in the herb garden and sprouted into a seedling roughly three cun high.

The seedling, like the seed, was half gold and half silver, looking extremely strange, and bore no resemblance to Mu Xiao's original body — the reason unknown.

Yang Kai gazed blankly at the three-cun seedling, bewildered.

He did not recognize the thing and had never heard of it, yet he could feel a peculiar power contained within; that power was still slight now, but if the seedling continued to grow it would surely become formidable.

He did not underestimate this three-cun seedling.

This was the result of nearly a year of nurturing in the herb garden of the Small Xuan Realm.

The herb garden in the Small Xuan Realm had Heavy Earth, five Earth Vein pearls, and the vitality brought by the Everlasting Tree; one day planted here was roughly equivalent to a hundred days outside.

In other words, if planted elsewhere, even if the Wood Seed survived, to grow to three cun would require at least a hundred years.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai grew more interested in the gold-and-silver seedling.

The harder something is to grow, the more valuable it becomes; after all, the Everlasting Tree survived countless years yet only reached three zhang in height.

Having confirmed the Wood Seed had taken, Yang Kai no longer paid it much attention; what use it had would require observation and inquiry later.

In the following period, he meditated in the Small Xuan Realm, refining the long-sword Secret Treasure once used by Han Leng and the Fei Sheng Palace's tower-ship.

The long sword Secret Treasure was a Dao Origin–Grade Lower-Level piece, just right for his current use. It would bolster his strength a bit, and paired with the Undying Five Elements Sword qi, it could even serve as a killing move. As for the tower-ship, that was naturally just for travel.

Time flew by, and more than a month passed.

Yang Kai left the Small Xuan Realm again and checked on Liu Yan, finding she still slept underground and it was unknown when she'd awaken.

Furrowing his brow and pondering, he summoned the tower-ship and flew toward Fenglin City.

Unable to determine when Liu Yan would emerge from seclusion, he saw no reason to waste time waiting.

After all, Liu Yan knew he was in Fenglin City; when she left seclusion she could come there to meet him. He needed to return to his cave-house in Fenglin City to prepare to refine the Dragon Bone sword into his body.
