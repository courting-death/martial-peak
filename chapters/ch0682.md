## Chapter 682 — Cang Yan

About a hundred zhang away from the Wind Eye, Duan Hai halted, looked at Yang Kai with a trace of regret, and was just about to say something when Yang Kai suddenly spoke with a venomous expression: "If I manage to turn this crisis into safety, you Leiguang just wait for my revenge!"

Duan Hai’s face went cold. He no longer hesitated and casually flung Yang Kai into that enormous Wind Eye.

He didn’t know if it was an illusion, but at the instant before Yang Kai’s figure vanished into the Wind Eye, he seemed to see the other reveal a sly smile.

Xu Qi rushed over, gaze alight as he looked toward the Wind Eye, his expression full of anticipation.

"Senior Brother, are you a little worried?" Xu Qi suddenly asked.

"Yes." Duan Hai nodded slightly. "I’m still a bit mindful of what Elder Du said to me before…"

"He shouldn’t have any backing. Things have come to this—if he really had backing, he would have said it. He’s not an idiot. Elder Du must have made a mistake," Xu Qi consoled.

"That’s true." Duan Hai smiled faintly. "But it’s also true that we’ve ruined a rare talent. We should carefully consider how to explain this to Elder Du."

"If he really asks, just say the man is in seclusion. With Elder Du’s status, he’s not going to personally come to our Leiguang to demand someone. After a few years, once the clamor dies down, I imagine Elder Du will forget about him."

"That’s also a way." Duan Hai sighed slightly. "Let’s wait a few days. This brat’s divine soul is unusually firm—in my view, not inferior to an ordinary Transcendent Realm cultivator. Even inside the Wind Eye he should be able to hold on for a few days. When his soul is blown out, we’ll gather it up and pry into the secrets he’s hiding."

"I’ll follow Senior Brother’s lead," Xu Qi said excitedly.

The two stood waiting. In less than two hours, Duan Hai suddenly furrowed his brows, turned to look into the distance, and said coldly, "Why is there a disciple coming over?"

Xu Qi also looked displeased. "I already ordered this place temporarily sealed. No one is allowed to trespass. Is that disciple deaf or blind?"

Saying so, he added impatiently, "I’ll go take a look."

Duan Hai nodded slightly.

Xu Qi unfolded his movement technique and swept away. Moments later, he returned with a strange look and said to Duan Hai, "Senior Brother, the Cult Master has given an order—he wants you to go over at once. That disciple came to transmit the command."

"The Cult Master?" Duan Hai was startled. He quickly composed himself and hurriedly said, "I’ll go take a look. You keep watch here."

"Rest assured, Senior Brother. I will keep a strict guard."

Duan Hai left in a hurry. When he reached the messenger disciple, he took him along and together they flew toward one of Leiguang Divine Cult’s peaks. That was where the Cult Master usually rested—very secluded and rich in Spiritual Qi, the finest peak of Leiguang Divine Cult.

"Did the Cult Master say what matter he summoned me for?" While speeding along, Duan Hai asked the disciple.

"This disciple does not know. The Cult Master only said to ask the Great Elder to come as soon as possible, without delay," the disciple replied respectfully.

"Could it be the Cult Master has advanced to the Saint Realm?" Duan Hai suddenly thought of a possibility and asked excitedly.

"I don’t think so. This disciple didn’t sense the commotion that should accompany the Cult Master’s advancement."

Duan Hai couldn’t help feeling puzzled, not knowing what urgent matter would lead the Cult Master to summon him at this critical juncture.

Leiguang Divine Cult’s Cult Master, Xia Chengyin, was a powerhouse at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, but he had been stuck at his own bottleneck for over a hundred years, unable to comprehend the mysteries of entering the Saint Realm. For these past dozen years, he had been in seclusion cultivating, sometimes not even seeing Duan Hai for several months at a time, yet this time he had summoned him in haste.

Could it be because of that boy?

Duan Hai’s heart gave a thump, then he felt he was being overly anxious and ridiculous. He smiled wryly and shook his head, asked no more, and sped along with the disciple.

In Leiguang Divine Cult, on a mountaintop where the Spiritual Qi was far denser than on the other peaks, there stood alone a single palace, built resplendent in gold and jade, quite imposing.

It was the residence of Leiguang Divine Cult’s Cult Master, Xia Chengyin.

At this moment, Xia Chengyin sat at the head seat, a cheerful smile on his face, warmly receiving the two sitting below. Even though they had disturbed his seclusion, Xia Chengyin didn’t dare show the slightest displeasure. Instead, he treated them with courtesy, extremely polite.

He had people present fruit platters and fine wine; after a bout of eating and drinking, Xia Chengyin finally asked, "Elder Du and Brother Cang Yan arriving together truly brings luster to my humble abode."

"Cult Master Xia is too polite. Disturbing your cultivation, this old man truly feels somewhat ill at ease." Du Wan seemed burdened with worries. He forced a smile at these words, reached out to pick up a spirit fruit from before him, and tossed it to Mi Na, who stood behind him.

Mi Na had come along with Elder Du this time as well. She was craning her neck, peering about, as if waiting for someone.

Reading their expressions, Xia Chengyin was full of doubts. He had no idea why Elder Du would arrive together with Tianxiao Sect’s Cang Yan. Concealing his misgivings, he laughed heartily and said, "What are you saying, Elder Du? If Elder Du wishes to come to my Leiguang, you may come at any time. Even if I’m cultivating—even if I’m dead—I’d crawl out of my coffin and sweep the couch to welcome you!"

Du Wan forced a smile and didn’t say more. With his status as a Saint-Grade Alchemist, he indeed had no need to exchange too many pleasantries with Xia Chengyin.

Even though he was Leiguang’s Cult Master, someone at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm was still somewhat lacking in stature before Elder Du.

Xia Chengyin looked over at the ever-solemn Cang Yan and felt a headache coming on.

Although Elder Du’s status was exalted and ordinary people could not even meet him, his temperament was gentle and he wasn’t hard to handle. But this madman from Tianxiao Sect was not on the same path as Elder Du. No matter how he thought about it, Xia Chengyin couldn’t figure out why he had deigned to descend upon Leiguang.

Could someone in the cult have offended him? If that were the case, he might very well turn Leiguang upside down.

Tianxiao Sect’s Four Madmen each had the level of the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, equal in strength to Xia Chengyin himself, and they had a Patriarch at the Saint Realm besides. One could say that even on the Tongxuan Continent, Tianxiao Sect was a major force, far from anything Leiguang could compare to.

Offend a force like that, and Leiguang would have only one end—annihilation!

Even one-on-one, Xia Chengyin didn’t dare guarantee he could defeat Cang Yan.

He gave a light cough and asked, "Brother Cang Yan, has anyone in my Divine Cult been blind and offended you recently?"

"No." Cang Yan was sparing with words, his expression wooden.

"Then why has Brother Cang Yan…" Xia Chengyin frowned and turned his gaze toward Elder Du, his face seeking an answer.

Elder Du gave a few dry laughs. “As the saying goes, one does not enter the Three Treasure Hall without cause. This time, Junior Brother Cang Yan and I truly have come for an important matter.”

"Elder Du, please speak plainly!" Xia Chengyin straightened his expression.

"We’re here to find someone."

"To find someone?"

"Mm. To find a Spirit-Grade Alchemist. Elder Duan Hai of your esteemed cult should know where he is. Two months ago, it was Duan Hai who took him from my Alchemists’ Association, inviting him to become one of Leiguang’s Honored Guests."

"So that’s how it is." Xia Chengyin suddenly understood. No wonder they had asked to see Duan Hai as soon as they arrived. He had been made to worry for nothing. After understanding the crux of the matter, Xia Chengyin couldn’t help relaxing a great deal, and he smiled. "Such a small matter should have been said earlier. Since he is an Honored Guest of my Divine Cult, Elder Duan Hai would certainly treat him with full courtesy and hospitality—he would never have neglected him."

"It had better be so. I’ve been looking for him for nearly two months." Cang Yan nodded in satisfaction upon hearing this.

For these two months, Cang Yan had remained in Giant Stone City, relying on the hazy impression the Patriarch had driven into his mind to search for Yang Kai’s traces, but he had never found him. In the end, by a stroke of chance, he inquired at the Alchemists’ Association and only then learned that Yang Kai was no longer in Giant Stone City.

Cang Yan was full of vexation. The Patriarch had entrusted him with such a small task, yet he had spent two months without accomplishing it. He immediately pinned the blame on Leiguang for taking Yang Kai away. Though he didn’t say it aloud, that icy gaze of his carried a distinctly displeased air.

"With Tianxiao Sect’s deep foundations, can you still be lacking a Spirit-Grade Alchemist? Brother Cang Yan, if you’ve come here to snatch our man, this Cult Master cannot agree." Xia Chengyin smiled and shook his head. There was no malice in these words; he was merely stating his stance.

Upon hearing this, Cang Yan said coolly, "It’s not that I want to snatch your man—it’s that my sect’s Patriarch wants to see him!"

Xia Chengyin was instantly struck dumb.

Off to the side, Du Wan shook his head and sighed, full of remorse.

Although he had long since guessed that Yang Kai’s background was extremely hard, he hadn’t expected even that person of Tianxiao Sect to be paying attention to him. When Cang Yan found the Alchemists’ Association, Elder Du had wished he could find a hole to crawl into.

If he had known earlier that Yang Kai had ties to Tianxiao Sect, how could he have recommended the other to enter Leiguang Divine Cult?

The way he had handled this matter was truly too foolish.

From the looks of it, that person from Tianxiao Sect and the boy’s backing sect must have some connection. Learning that he had entered the world to temper himself, he wanted to give him a bit of shelter. Elder Du pondered inwardly, feeling this was very likely the case.

"Still not here? Why so slow?" Mi Na finished that spirit fruit, stared at the door, and grumbled in dissatisfaction.

Xia Chengyin chuckled. "Be patient, little girl. Duan Hai should be here soon."

"Who wants to see some Duan Hai? I want to see Yang Kai! That bastard was so heartless, leaving me alone at the Alchemists’ Association. This time I’ve got to properly teach him a lesson!" Mi Na huffed.

Xia Chengyin felt thoroughly awkward.

"Do not be rude!" Seeing Xia Chengyin’s embarrassment, Elder Du gave a light reprimand. Mi Na pouted.

Just then, an aura rapidly approached from afar.

"He’s here!" Xia Chengyin smiled slightly.

In no time, Duan Hai’s voice came from outside the door: "Cult Master, Duan Hai has come as ordered."

"Come in," Xia Chengyin called out.

Duan Hai answered and stepped inside. After entering the grand hall, just as he was about to salute, he suddenly saw Cang Yan and Du Wan seated below.

Duan Hai’s heart lurched; he wished he could turn around and leave on the spot.

Cang Yan appearing here was already most unusual. As one of Tianxiao Sect’s Four Madmen, Duan Hai knew something of his cruel methods and formidable cultivation. He had always kept a respectful distance from this man.

And Elder Du appearing here shocked him even more.

Du Wan was a Saint-Grade Alchemist. For these last dozen years, he had always been seated in Giant Stone City and had never taken a single step out of the Alchemists’ Association. The four great nearby forces had each enthusiastically invited him, hoping to have him come to their forces to impart some experience to their alchemists, yet aside from Tianxiao Sect succeeding twice, whether Rashomon Gate, Ancient Moon Sanctuary, or Leiguang, none had ever managed to invite him.
