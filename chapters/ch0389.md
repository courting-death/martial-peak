## Chapter 389 — South and North Do Not Gaze Upon Each Other, The Number One City in the World

Yang Kai had long awoken, one might even say that he had not rested throughout the entire night.

The two Blood Servants were refining a Pill to heal their injuries, and since Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman were both women, the duty of monitoring the surroundings naturally fell upon him.

Looking at Yang Kai, the two Blood Servants couldn't help but feel a subtle warmth in their hearts.

Just as they were about to express their gratitude, Yang Kai cast a faint glance at them and asked, "Which force does this area belong to?"

Tu Feng pondered for a moment and then spoke, "I remember that this should be within the jurisdiction of Tianyuan City."

Tianyuan City was not only the name of a city but also the name of a force.

"What rank is Tianyuan City?" Yang Kai frowned.

"A first-rate force, young master, why do you suddenly inquire about this?" Tu Feng did not understand why he had grown concerned about Tianyuan City.

Yang Kai revealed a set of sharp white teeth and smiled at him, a hint of cunning in that grin.

Qiu Yimeng opened her eyes and scoffed from beside him, "He has found another target to rob."

"Forced by the circumstances, a helpless act!" Yang Kai shrugged.

Seeing that he did not deny it, the two Blood Servants couldn't help but feel a sense of dread.

After all, even the Lü Family, located thousands of miles away, had suffered an unforeseen calamity because of yesterday's events; soon Lü Liang would probably burden himself with gifts to bring to Zhongdu for Yang Kai. How could Tianyuan City, located nearby, remain uninvolved?

No matter how one looked at it, Yang Kai had been attacked within the sphere of influence of Tianyuan City, and the responsibility could be large or small.

It all depended on how the higher-ups of that force chose to act.

During such a sensitive period, even the smallest matter could evolve into a major incident.

"Do we need to send a message to Tianyuan City?" Tu Feng, clearly experienced by now, could not help but feel a surge of anticipation upon hearing this. "If it is necessary, I can go take care of it right now; I believe they wouldn’t dare say anything."

Even Tang Yuxian now showed an excited expression, seemingly wanting to snatch the messenger task from Tu Feng.

"No need, they will naturally know about this sort of matter." Yang Kai shook his head, stood up, and said, "Alright, let us depart. We have already delayed quite a bit; I truly wonder what Zhongdu has turned into."

"Is the condition of both seniors serious? Should we rest for a few more days?" Qiu Yimeng frowned and asked with concern.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian exchanged a glance and quickly shook their heads. "It’s nothing serious."

Seeing him say so, Qiu Yimeng did not insist further.

Without the Treading Cloud Steed, the group of five could only fly to speed up their journey, causing their pace to naturally slow significantly.

After a day and night, the disparity in strength among the several young people became evident. Even after flying for so long, Yang Kai remained calm, his face unchanging, as if he had not exerted himself at all.

Qiu Yimeng was, however, slightly out of breath. To keep up with the two Divine Roaming Realm cultivators, her True Essence had been severely drained.

As for Luo Xiaoman, she was in a more dire state, her face flushed. Sweat was pouring down her forehead, and the two bunnies on her chest rose and fell with her breath, creating quite a spectacle.

Yet she gritted her teeth and followed the others in silence.

Had it not been for Tang Yuxian's pity, offering her support, Luo Xiaoman would have already been left behind by the group.

They traveled on a backroad and encountered no further dangers. They stopped for the night, and after one night’s rest, they set off again.

As the sun rose and the moon hidden, after a full eight days, the group finally caught sight of a massive city.

Zhongdu!

Seemingly the center of the entire world, the size of Zhongdu was beyond description; even from hundreds of miles away, they could still see its outline.

The grand momentum surged towards them, instilling a sense of smallness within their beings.

When people think of Zhongdu, they can’t help but recall a saying: 

"South and North Do Not Gaze Upon Each Other, The Number One City in the World!"

Standing to the south of the city, one could not see the north at all; the entirety of Zhongdu seemed like an endless ocean, vast and impressive, covering a broad expanse.

There may often be instances where, on one side of the city, dark clouds gather and thunder roars, while on the other side, the sun shines bright, and the sky is as blue as it gets.

Even a Divine Roaming Realm expert would take at least two or three hours to fully fly across the entire city!

From this, one could see the enormity and scale of this city.

The Number One City in the World, a name truly well-deserved!

It was hard to imagine how such a massive city, capable of becoming a small nation, had been established. It seemed it had existed in the records of history for ages. Over the years, the Eight Great Families had firmly occupied this largest city in the world, continually expanding and fortifying it, greatly increasing its area.

This had forged the miracle that was today!

The footsteps of the five came to a halt as they gazed into the distance at Zhongdu.

"Though I have lived inside for so long, each time I return after being out, I can't help but want to take a few more glances," Tang Yuxian remarked with a hint of nostalgia.

Tu Feng nodded gravely. It was not only them; anyone who stood outside Zhongdu would marvel and stop to behold its grandeur, whether they had lived there long or were visiting for the first time.

Looking at the giant city that had been absent for several years, Yang Kai maintained a calm expression. Only when he remembered his parents at home did his emotions fluctuate slightly.

Qiu Yimeng tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, glanced at Yang Kai, and said, "Why don't Xiaoman and I split off here and walk separately from you? At this time, if anyone sees us all walking together, it might raise some suspicions."

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded in agreement.

Tu Feng suddenly looked at Qiu Yimeng with a smile and asked, "Miss Qiu, will your Qiu Family stand by young master in this competition for the throne?"

Qiu Yimeng chuckled lightly, her gaze fixated on Yang Kai for a moment. "Even though I am acquainted with your young master, this competition for the throne is of great significance; I must think it through carefully."

"What more is there to consider?" Tang Yuxian smiled and said, "Aside from the young master, you don’t know the other young masters and their depths; rashly supporting them might prove unwise. Even though losing wouldn’t greatly impact the Qiu Family, a figure like young master is undoubtedly worth the gamble."

Qiu Yimeng gazed at Yang Kai with a playful smile, as if she was awaiting something.

But after waiting for a long time, Yang Kai showed no intention of speaking, causing her to feel slightly annoyed in her heart. With a light snort, she said, "Then it all depends on how your young master performs."

These words carried significant implication.

Performance; was it in front of her or in the competition for the throne?

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian exchanged meaningful glances, their expressions becoming strange as if they had uncovered a great secret, and they focused intently on Qiu Yimeng.

Qiu Yimeng remained unfazed, her demeanor calm.

Tu Feng continued to stoke the flames with a lewd expression, saying, "If young master and Miss Qiu join forces, they would surely be a perfect match. The future of Zhongdu might very well belong to both of you; who knows, it could even become a lovely story."

Tang Yuxian quickly took over the conversation, "I think the same. Miss Qiu, please don’t hesitate."

"Hehe..." Qiu Yimeng smiled lightly, appearing not to understand the implications of Tu Feng's words. She felt neither awkward nor flushed, casually glancing at Yang Kai now and then.

Just when Tu Feng was about to say something else while rubbing his mouth, Yang Kai suddenly spoke, "Until we meet again."

This statement came quite abruptly; Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were both unsure whether to make another effort to secure a powerful ally for Yang Kai, but unexpectedly, he just wanted to leave like that.

After saying this, he indeed left.

The two Blood Servants stood stunned for a moment before clasping their fists toward Qiu Yimeng and hurriedly chased after Yang Kai's pace.

As they watched Yang Kai's silhouette vanish quickly, Qiu Yimeng also stood dumbfounded for a long time, seemingly surprised that his departure had been so decisive and straightforward, devoid of any hesitation.

"This guy!" Luo Xiaoman huffed angrily, "How rude! After everything we've been through together, he actually leaves without a word?"

Qiu Yimeng's gaze flickered with thought.

Did he see through it?

He must have seen through it, right? That’s why he didn’t bother to put in any effort and just left in such a straightforward manner.

This man was indeed not easy to fool.

"Sister Qiu, aren’t you angry?" Luo Xiaoman seemed to advocate for Qiu Yimeng, stamping her foot. "How can he ignore you?"

"Alright." Qiu Yimeng took a deep breath and pulled Luo Xiaoman along. "Let’s go back to the Qiu Family first."

"Okay."

"Once we reach the Qiu Family, I’ll send a message to Ziwai Valley so they don’t worry."

"Mm, I understand."

"It’s been such a long time since you saw your Senior Brother Fan Hong; do you miss him?" Qiu Yimeng smiled as she attempted to find a topic to alleviate her own sense of loss.

"Not really," Luo Xiaoman blushed and shook her head, murmuring, "I don’t know why; it seems I haven’t thought of him at all during this long period."

"That’s because you’ve seen the wonders outside!"

The two young girls hadn’t known each other a year prior, but ever since their trip to the Lingxiao Pavilion, experiencing various dangers together along the way, they had remained inseparable, treating each other like family.

Thus, no matter what Qiu Yimeng said, Luo Xiaoman would always comply without a word of opposition.

On the other side, Yang Kai and the two Blood Servants sped towards the southern part of Zhongdu.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian closely followed Yang Kai in silence, both filled with doubt, not understanding why he showed no enthusiasm towards gaining the support of the Qiu Family.

If Yang Kai looked down on the Lü Family, the two Blood Servants could understand, but the Qiu Family was different! As one of the Eight Great Families, obtaining the support of any of them would be a considerable advantage.

As long as one’s mind remained clear, there was no reason to let such an opportunity slip away.

Moreover, Qiu Yimeng’s position in the Qiu Family was not low; winning her over meant securing the Qiu Family's support.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were eager to ask but didn’t know how to broach the subject. They followed behind Yang Kai, feeling anxious.

After a while, Tang Yuxian subtly sent a surge of energy that directly struck Tu Feng.

Tu Feng, who had been deep in thought, was caught off guard and let out a startled cry.

Tang Yuxian couldn't help but roll her eyes, feeling utterly speechless.
