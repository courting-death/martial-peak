## Chapter 1502 — Coercion

Everyone present could hardly believe their eyes.

How long has it even been? From the moment Yang Kai produced the Formation Talisman until now, it had been no more than the time for one stick of incense to burn; in just that brief span, a dozen-odd Origin Returning Realm cultivators had already lost their lives at Yang Kai’s hands.

Just what had happened within that formation?

No one knew, but none dared look down on Yang Kai in the slightest any longer.

“Good, good, you are very good!” Qu Zheng stared at Yang Kai with bloodshot eyes. The hatred for his son’s killer was carved into his heart, and seeing Yang Kai at this moment, he naturally refused to let the matter rest. “You truly did not disappoint this old man. Your life—this old man will personally take it!”

As his voice fell, Qu Zheng’s figure transformed into a long rainbow, pouncing toward Yang Kai like a tiger descending the mountain.

“Alliance Master, you must not!” Exclamations rose from all directions. Half of the people had already died at Yang Kai’s hands—his strength was clearly anything but ordinary. Now that Qu Zheng’s rage was attacking his heart, heedless of consequences, regardless of who was stronger between him and Yang Kai, rushing in like this would only put him at a disadvantage.

If he was not a match, he would certainly be injured.

If he killed Yang Kai, Star Emperor Mountain would hold them to account.

Thus, the instant Qu Zheng made a move, many tried to stop him.

It was to no avail. Qu Zheng now wanted only to put Yang Kai to death and avenge Qu Changfeng; how could he heed anyone’s persuasion?

Midway through the charge, his palms crossed; boundless Saint Yuan condensed into substance and came crashing down over Yang Kai’s head.

Yang Kai looked at him with a cold sneer, utterly unafraid. He flipped his hand and pushed out a palm; a massive palm imprint appeared out of thin air, completely covering the space before Qu Zheng and even momentarily blotting out the light before his eyes.

Heaven-Covering Palm!

Qu Zheng’s expression hardened. Though enraged to the extreme, as a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert who had experienced countless battles large and small, his accumulated battle experience was incomparably rich; in an instant he perceived the tremendous lethality of that palm imprint.

He had no intention of dodging; his Saint Yuan surged all the more violently.

The two energies met at the midpoint, thunderous booms rolling without end. The rampaging energy fluctuations formed sudden gales that spread in all directions.

Qu Zheng was blasted backward, and Yang Kai also retreated more than ten steps.

This exchange was actually evenly matched!

Fang Peng’s face changed drastically.

To achieve this under Qu Zheng’s strike born of fury meant that Yang Kai’s strength was in no way inferior to the other! In other words, he was on par with himself as well.

This brat truly is a freak.

“Brother Qu, curb your anger!” Fang Peng barked sternly. “The dead cannot be brought back to life. Your anger now is useless. If you want the enemy to suffer, killing him is not the only way.”

At these words, some of the blood-red light faded from Qu Zheng’s eyes, as if he had come back to his senses. He fixed a chilly gaze on Yang Kai, drew a light breath, nodded, and said in a deep voice, “Brother Fang speaks true. It was I, Qu, who was reckless.”

He finally reacted—this operation was not as simple as killing Yang Kai, but to capture him alive.

While the two spoke, Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent, yet he intentionally or otherwise glanced toward the crowd at an old man in a brown long robe with grizzled hair.

This should be the old fellow Liang Yong had warned about earlier.

At first glance, the man was utterly unremarkable, standing casually amid the crowd, but when Yang Kai probed him carefully, he discovered that this old fellow was anything but simple.

There was actually an aura on him that even made Yang Kai somewhat apprehensive.

He did not dare observe too closely, lest he alert the snake; Yang Kai did not know what ability the old man possessed that made him wary.

If his guess was correct, this old fellow should be from Star Emperor Mountain. This time, Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect had joined hands against him precisely because they had received Star Emperor Mountain’s orders; as the one issuing commands, Star Emperor Mountain would naturally send someone to accompany them.

He hid himself perfectly. If not for Liang Yong’s reminder, Yang Kai would not have noticed him; the limelight of Qu Zheng and Fang Peng had completely drowned him out.

“Sect Master Yang is indeed a hero in the bloom of youth; this old one is impressed!” From afar, Fang Peng cupped his fist, a trace of pain and anger flashing deep within his eyes. Among those dragged by Yang Kai into the formation and slain just now, fully half belonged to his Leitai Sect, and not a few among them were Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts.

To die so for nothing—Fang Peng naturally felt heartache.

After this battle, though it would not injure the sect’s foundation, it would certainly damage Leitai Sect’s strength. Moreover, if word spread, Leitai Sect’s prestige would plummet a thousand zhang.

“Sect Master Fang, do you think the people you have left can capture me?” Yang Kai smiled faintly and looked at him coolly.

“Hehe, earlier I, Fang, thought it foolproof, but after witnessing Sect Master Yang’s methods, I no longer dare think so.” Fang Peng slowly shook his head, a face full of helplessness.

“It’s for the best that Sect Master Fang thinks so,” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

“However, although I have no wish to be enemies with Sect Master Yang, you have killed so many people; I cannot just let you walk away. Mm, Sect Master Yang, please be patient and meet two friends first.”

“Two friends?” Yang Kai’s brows knit as a sense of foreboding rose within him.

“Bring them up!” Fang Peng clapped his hands and looked at Yang Kai with a face full of smugness.

At his command, two arcs of rainbow light suddenly appeared not far away and sped toward them. When the radiance dispersed and the figures within were revealed, Yang Kai’s pupils involuntarily contracted and his face grew grim.

The two figures within the rainbow light were actually Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, who had entered together with him!

The two had clearly gone through a bitter battle; their bodies were mottled with blood and they were in a miserable state. At this moment both appeared dispirited—Qian Tong’s left arm was twisted, obviously broken, and in Fei Zhi Tu’s chest and abdomen there were several small holes, as if wounded by a weapon like a sharp sword, blood flowing in a steady stream.

Escorted to this place, both men could only give Yang Kai a helpless, bitter smile.

They had never expected to be plotted against here—let alone that the scheme would be aimed at dealing with Yang Kai! Both Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu had underestimated the audacity of Qu Zheng and Fang Peng.

By rights, their statuses were not low; Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect would not lightly offend them. But this time, with Star Emperor Mountain behind the scenes, how would Qu Zheng and Fang Peng still scruple Yingyue Hall?

“We were ambushed,” Qian Tong pursed his lips and said dryly.

Though it had been a sneak attack, victory belongs to the victor and defeat to the vanquished—his expression at this moment was anything but pleasant.

Otherwise, with the strength of the two of them, how could they have been captured alive? If they could not win, could they not even flee? They were also Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts; only because they were caught off guard and exploited did they instantly fall behind, leaving them no way to escape.

Moreover, to deal with the two of them, Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect had dispatched five or six people. Being few against many, the result was self-evident.

“I can see that,” Yang Kai nodded lightly. “You two—are you unharmed?”

“Still all right; we will not die for the time being. They have only placed a restriction on us, so we cannot circulate Saint Yuan.” Fei Zhi Tu grinned, looking not too bad in spirit.

“Then good!” Yang Kai drew a light breath, turned his head, narrowed his eyes at Fang Peng, and said in a low voice, “Sect Master Fang, what do you mean by this!”

“Nothing much.” Fang Peng chuckled, his manner affable. “I merely heard that Sect Master Yang has mastery over some special powers, so I took precautions in advance—who would have thought they would actually be of use. Sect Master Yang seems to have quite a good relationship with Elder Qian and City Lord Fei, yes? I wonder whether you will bind your own hands for their sake?”

“You want me to surrender without a fight?” Yang Kai sneered. “Sect Master Fang, have you just woken up? Do you have any idea how the world will see your Leitai Sect and Battle Sky Alliance once word of this gets out?”

Fang Peng slowly shook his head. “Let the world think what it will—what matters is how Sect Master Yang chooses. Sect Master Yang, you’ve already killed quite a few of our people; how about we end things here today? If you stop resisting, this old man will guarantee no harm comes to Elder Qian or City Lord Fei. We’re all figures of some standing on Dark Star—I’ve no wish to tear our faces apart. Otherwise, it’ll make future meetings rather unpleasant, don’t you agree?”

He spoke kindly with patient persuasion, as if merely urging Yang Kai to give up something unimportant.

“What if I say no?”

“Hehe…” Fang Peng laughed, pondered a moment, and then said, “It seems Sect Master Yang has not yet understood the seriousness of the matter.”

“If he does not understand, then this old man will make him understand!” Qu Zheng suddenly spoke from the side.

As he said this, his figure flickered and he instantly arrived before Fei Zhi Tu. Under Fei Zhi Tu’s startled gaze, he flipped his hand and a short-spear-like Secret Treasure appeared in his palm. Without the slightest hesitation, he thrust it straight toward Fei Zhi Tu’s chest.

With a wet puff, blood splattered in all directions.

Fei Zhi Tu’s body was pierced through—the short spear passed through his chest and abdomen, its shaft drenched in crimson blood.

“Old Fei!” Qian Tong cried out in shock, never imagining that Qu Zheng would be so decisive and vicious.

“Cough, cough…” Fei Zhi Tu hacked violently, a cloud of blood mist spraying out to shroud Qu Zheng’s face, and the latter actually did not dodge, allowing the blood mist to dye him red; his already ferocious features became all the more deranged.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed to slits.

Under his Divine Sense probe, that strike just now, while it had not directly taken Fei Zhi Tu’s life, had grazed his heart; had it been off by a hair, Fei Zhi Tu would have died on the spot.

And with such a severe penetrating wound, even with the foundation of a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator, recovering would not be easy.

“Hehe, Alliance Master Qu has just suffered the pain of losing his son. This old man also spent quite some time persuading him before he calmed down. Sect Master Yang, I think it best that you do not anger him at this moment.” Fang Peng reminded leisurely from the side. “In truth, you also do not wish Elder Qian and City Lord Fei to really die here because of you, do you? Whether they live or die lies in a single thought of yours.”

“Yang Kai, I will give you ten breaths. Consider carefully. If you cannot satisfy this Alliance Master, I will kill them at once!” Qu Zheng growled.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu wore faces full of resentment. Being taken as chips to coerce Yang Kai, they felt wretched; unfortunately, with restrictions placed within their bodies and unable to circulate Saint Yuan, they could not help Yang Kai in the slightest.

“Fine, I will go with you. Let Elder Qian and City Lord Fei go!” To everyone’s surprise, Yang Kai agreed at once, though his face was exceedingly grim.

“Yang Kai, you…” Qian Tong looked at him with grief and guilt. “You need not do this!”
