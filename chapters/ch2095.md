## Chapter 2095 — Regrowing a Severed Limb

Their guesses were largely correct, yet no one had expected Mu Xiao's involvement; if Mu Xiao had not secretly possessed Ning Yuancheng, Han Leng would not have been killed by a sneak attack.

With Yang Kai's strength at that time, facing a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm warrior from a noble lineage like Han Leng, he would not necessarily have any advantage.

Faces shifted; everyone secretly envied Yang Kai and felt alarmed at his luck.

"Kid, hand over that vial of Spiritual Pill and that Secret Treasure!" the man surnamed Fu suddenly demanded, thrusting his hand toward Yang Kai, "these items rightfully belong to my Fei Sheng Palace; you should return them!"

"That claim makes no sense, sir."

Before Yang Kai could reply, Hua Qingsi gave a disdainful smile and said, "Unclaimed things belong to whoever picks them up. This Junior Brother obtained these items by fate — it's his opportunity. You open your mouth to demand them? Have you no shame?"

Then she turned to Yang Kai and said, "Junior Brother, don't listen to him."

"Junior Brother..."

Yang Kai's mouth twitched; he felt distinctly uncomfortable.

"Wretched slut, do you really think this Lord is afraid of you?" The man surnamed Fu, having been rebuked and mocked by Hua Qingsi time and again, was boiling with rage; he couldn't hold back any longer and blurted the insult.

"Men without ability sure look ugly when they start insulting others, tsk tsk..." Hua Qingsi's look of contempt deepened.

The man surnamed Fu was furious. If not for the Heart-Demon Oath he had just sworn, he would have fought Hua Qingsi to the death to defend his honor.

Hua Qingsi continued to needle him, "So petty! Junior Brother, would you be willing to give Sister a Blood-Returning Origin Pill?"

"Sure!" Yang Kai nodded; he produced the vial of Spiritual Pill, partly to use the chance to clear himself of suspicion and partly because he intended to share it with everyone.

In the formation they shared honor and disgrace; he could not remain aloof.

"Everyone gets a share." Yang Kai said as he handed each person a Blood-Returning Origin Pill — everyone received one except the man surnamed Fu.

As a senior of Fei Sheng Palace, no one would believe he had no such pills; since he hoarded them and refused to share, Yang Kai was not stupid enough to give him one.

"This Junior Brother is generous; Sister takes a liking to you." After Hua Qingsi pocketed the Blood-Returning Origin Pill, her eyes shimmered with allure. Smiling, she regarded Yang Kai with enthralling peach-blossom eyes and gemlike lips, "Since you gave me a Spiritual Pill, Sister will protect you; if anyone dares make a move on you, they'll have to get through me first!"

As she spoke she glanced at the man surnamed Fu, full of provocation.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Well then, many thanks to you, Sister!"

Seeing him so obliging, Hua Qingsi couldn't help flashing him a coquettish smile. Yang Kai instantly put on a lovestruck, utterly bewitched expression that left Duan Yuanshan and the others feeling put out — they cursed the shameless pair under their breath, wondering why such good fortune never fell to them.

"You have some nerve!" the man surnamed Fu fumed, his scalp prickling with anger, "This isn't over."

"Sister! He's threatening me!" Yang Kai immediately pleaded for help.

Hua Qingsi's eyes flicked, unconcerned, "He hasn't even laid a hand on you yet — Junior Brother, don't be so timid!"

"Can you all be a bit quieter? This is splitting my attention." Qin Yu, who had been focused on repairing the seal, suddenly snapped, scowling angrily and glaring at the noisy few.

When she spoke, everyone instantly fell silent, though all could feel how delicate the atmosphere had become.

The seven in formation were not of one mind; this expedition was destined to run into trouble.

For a time the mine fell into a deathlike hush; only the ceaseless howling Demonic Qi and the low roars of the monsters could be heard.

Qin Yu continued to repair the seal without a word.

Before long Duan Yuanshan suddenly frowned and cried out, "Something is coming!"

The man surnamed Fu and Hua Qingsi showed no surprise, evidently having noticed it earlier; Yang Kai was likewise unperturbed — his Divine Sense was in no way inferior to a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert, so he had noticed even earlier and could vaguely perceive circumstances unknown to others.

The other First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivators stiffened upon hearing this.

Whoosh...

Amid the billowing Demonic Qi, human and beast silhouettes began to coalesce—clearly beings corrupted into demons.

The group had lingered in the pit a while, and this place was the source of the Demonic Qi leak; the creatures naturally would not ignore it.

No sooner had they appeared than they launched a desperate, all-out assault, as if their lives meant nothing.

Before long the front was piled high with countless corpses; the blood stench was overpowering.

Though their results were remarkable, everyone felt uneasy, for they were suppressing the leaking Demonic Qi while fighting endless demonic creatures, and the rate at which their Origin Qi was draining had increased by a third.

In less than the time an incense stick burned, each person's Origin Qi had been consumed by over half.

At this rate, it would not be long before their Origin Qi was exhausted, and they would have to take the Blood-Returning Origin Pill.

"Roar..."

Suddenly, a furious roar rang out from somewhere, and a blinding radiance flared up, coalescing into a colossal, world‑shattering axe that came crashing down from the sky.

Even before it struck, a surging pressure descended from the sky, causing several First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivators to blanch.

Even the man surnamed Fu and Hua Qingsi grew suddenly solemn.

"Giant Spirit Axe?" Duan Yuanshan exclaimed, as if recognizing the Secret Treasure; he barked an order and quickly formed seals with both hands.

The Black Tortoise's shadow reared its head and raised a massive palm to meet the axe.

Boom...

The normally indestructible Black Tortoise palm merely managed to block the axe this time, and its palm was split open with a large gash, nearly torn in two.

Duan Yuanshan's face changed again as he realized he had underestimated the Giant Spirit Axe's potency and hastened to reinforce the formation's power.

Just then, a shadow flickered to the side and a figure materialized like a phantom not far from them. His eyes were a deep, crimson-black; he made no use of a Secret Treasure, instead raising a fist swathed in Demonic Qi and driving it down with brutal force.

"Delusional!" Duan Yuanshan roared, accelerating the formation seals in both hands. The Black Tortoise opened its enormous maw and, with a swing of its head, lunged to bite down on the phantom-like figure.

The massive mouth, like a house, swallowed that person whole.

Yet before anyone could feel relief, the Black Tortoise's mouth began to bulge and contract as if something violent stirred within; with a bang the swallowed figure burst out, staggered back, and stood beside the one who had wielded the Giant Spirit Axe, their throats letting out low howls.

"Brother Cheng, Brother Zhou..." Duan Yuanshan's gaze grew complex as he looked at the two suddenly appearing demons; he sighed, "We parted three years ago — I never expected to see you two in such a state today."

His face was full of lament; he clearly recognized the pair.

Qin Chaoyang likewise paled and said gravely, "They are the two City Lords of Musen City!"

"Musen City!" Yang Kai murmured, then sighed, "It seems Musen City has fallen."

Earlier that old fraud said he'd come from Musen City to Fenglin City seeking aid; now both city lords of Musen City have appeared here and have been turned into demons — Musen City's fate was plain to see.

Yang Kai suddenly hissed, "If they're here, then Jiang Taisheng must be here as well! Everyone be careful."

"Just a few First Stage demonized foes, what is there to fear? Watch this Lord handle them." The man surnamed Fu, full of frustration, saw an outlet for his anger and deliberately sought to display his strength.

He intended to show off; with that he produced in his hand a short spear a zhang long, pouring Origin Qi into it.

"Conserve Origin Qi!" Duan Yuanshan warned as soon as he saw the move.

But it was too late: the short spear glittered, and in a flash it vanished from his hand with a ripping sound as it tore through the void.

Not far off, the demon Cheng seemed to sense it and twisted his body.

A moment later blood mist erupted from his shoulder; that arm exploded open, revealing dark, oozing flesh and white, exposed bone — a stark contrast.

Cheng howled in pain; the roar acted like an invisible shockwave that unsettled the Sea of Consciousness, but the gathered warriors had formidable strength and, relying on the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation, simply channeled power to suppress the disturbance.

"Still alive?" the man surnamed Fu was astonished.

His spear was a Dao Origin-Grade, Middle-Level Secret Treasure with tremendous power; he had expected that dealing with a mindless demon would be trivial, yet the opponent managed to avoid the vital point and only lost an arm.

"It seems that once their minds are lost, their combat instincts are heightened considerably," Yang Kai mused; the previous strike had made him feel threatened — clearly not something easily evaded.

Hua Qingsi nodded in agreement.

Then a startling scene unfolded.

At Cheng's severed shoulder, Demonic Qi churned and flowed toward the wound; before everyone's eyes the flesh at the wound writhed and rapidly regrew.

In no more than ten breaths, his severed arm had regenerated!
