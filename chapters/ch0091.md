## Chapter 91 — A Tangle of Unease

Upon hearing these words, Long Hui’s expression brightened considerably. “You mean the thing they seek lies just ahead?”

“Indeed. They should have arrived here yesterday, but have yet to make a move. Clearly, they have reached their destination,” Wen Feichen replied with a smile.

“Then what are we waiting for? We have pursued them all this way for this very moment!” Long Hui’s heart surged with eagerness. The treasures and geniuses were secondary now; what he truly longed for was to behold Xia Ningshang’s true face. After holding back for so many days, his patience was wearing thin.

Wen Feichen smiled calmly. “Though they have arrived, it seems they have yet to acquire what they seek. Young Master Long, bear with it a little longer. I assure you, that woman will not escape.”

Long Hui grew impatient. Wen Feichen had said the same back in the small town, yet their pursuit had been costly. Now hearing it again, Long Hui’s displeasure was evident.

Still, he dared not show too much eagerness. After some thought, he said, “Then we wait no more than two days. If they remain inactive after that, we strike!”

Wen Feichen sighed inwardly, thinking Long Hui was hopeless—his mind consumed only by women, with no other ambition. Such a man’s future achievements would surely be limited.

Under the dark and windy night, Xia Ningshang, who had been recovering in the valley, finally opened her eyes. The exhaustion had vanished; she was fully restored.

After expressing her thanks, she and Yang Kai took out some food and drink to replenish themselves.

“It will soon be midnight. At that time, this valley will be filled with Yin energy. Junior Brother, do not stray far from me. Your realm is not high, and your Primordial Qi reserves are limited—you cannot afford to waste it,” Xia Ningshang warned solemnly.

“Understood,” Yang Kai nodded. Though he had dozens of drops of Yang Liquid stored in his dantian and was not worried about consumption, he kept this to himself.

They spoke for a while longer when suddenly the valley stirred with an unusual change.

By all rights, this valley, sunken dozens of zhang beneath the earth and surrounded on all sides by rock walls, should have been windless. Yet now, a sudden gust of chilling wind howled through the valley, its mournful sound like a woman weeping in the night, sending shivers down the spine and striking terror into the heart.

With the rising Yin wind came a creeping coldness from the ground, so chilling that Yang Kai’s True Yang Technique involuntarily activated.

This cold was unlike the biting chill of winter winds; it was suffused with a ghostly aura, penetrating to the bone with its icy touch.

Accelerating the True Yang Technique, Yang Kai finally dispelled the chill within his heart.

“Junior Brother!” Xia Ningshang suddenly tugged Yang Kai close, pulling him beside her. She then produced a purple jade pendant, clutching it tightly.

As Yang Kai neared her, the coldness vanished without a trace, replaced by a warm current flowing around them.

“Stay close to me. Don’t stray far. This jade pendant can resist the invasion of Yin energy,” Xia Ningshang explained softly.

Yang Kai glanced at the purple jade pendant in surprise. It was yet another secret treasure. When Xia Ningshang channeled her Primordial Qi into it, the pendant emitted a faint glow, driving away all surrounding Yin energy.

He was astonished. This senior sister’s bracelet was a secret treasure, and now this jade pendant was another. How many treasures did she possess?

“Why are you staring at me like that?” Xia Ningshang’s face flushed crimson, her voice barely above a whisper.

Yang Kai was taken aback, suddenly realizing the awkwardness of the situation.

Because the pendant’s protective range was limited, the two stood almost pressed together, their bodies nearly touching. He could clearly feel her warmth—the softness of her body and the faint fragrance of her hair.

No doubt, Xia Ningshang felt the same.

Such intimacy overwhelmed her. A shy mist gathered in her eyes, and a rosy blush spread across her earlobes and neck.

“Your Primordial Qi is precious. You must not waste it here; it should be reserved for capturing the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew,” Xia Ningshang said, trying to distract herself from the warmth radiating from Yang Kai’s body. Yet the more she tried, the more vivid the sensation became.

“This is only the beginning. When midnight arrives, the entire valley will be suffused with dense Yin energy. Junior Brother, you must not leave my side, or the consequences will be dire.”

“Very well,” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Neither spoke further. They stood closely together in silence, awaiting the arrival of midnight.

A few heartbeats.

A tangle of unease.

Xia Ningshang’s body grew warmer and warmer. For the first time in her life, she felt as if needles pricked her back, a maddening itch coursing through her. She wanted to move but dared not. By the end, her body trembled slightly.

Yang Kai noticed her discomfort and frowned, looking at her blood-tinged skin. “Shall I step outside?”

He was confident in resisting the Yin energy’s invasion; after all, his True Yang Primordial Qi was the Yin energy’s bane. Even if it consumed some, it would be minimal. Seeing her so distressed made him uneasy as well.

“No!” Xia Ningshang hurriedly shook her head. “You just stay by my side. Don’t go out.”

Her insistence left Yang Kai with no choice.

Meanwhile, the Blood Battle Gang had already sensed the disturbance and hurried over.

Watching the churning Yin energy below, Wen Feichen pondered deeply.

Long Hui’s expression brightened. “Chief Wen, have they succeeded?”

If Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang had succeeded, they could act without hesitation.

Wen Feichen did not answer immediately, continuing to observe the valley below. There was surely something strange about it, but even with his insight and experience, he could not discern it. Seeing Long Hui’s impatience, Wen Feichen sighed and said, “Whether they have succeeded or not is uncertain, but this celestial anomaly must be caused by a great treasure about to appear. Perhaps we should—”

Before Wen Feichen could finish, Long Hui interrupted impatiently, “No more waiting. Since the treasure is about to emerge, whether they get it or not is irrelevant. Chief Wen, let us strike now. We can deal with them first, then take the treasure.”

Wen Feichen sighed and nodded. “Very well, we shall act!”

In the black night, Long Hui’s eyes gleamed with a sinister light. Just thinking of the masked beauty soon to have her defenses stripped away, her fair face revealed before him, and then lying beneath him in ecstasy, he could hardly contain his excitement.

“Yang Kai, if you dare set your sights on my woman, I will make you know the true meaning of regret. I will not kill you immediately. Instead, I will let you witness how I violate your woman, hear her screams of agony, and savor your rage and helplessness.”

The thirteen men made no effort to conceal their presence. At Wen Feichen’s signal, they leapt down into the valley below.

The disciple from Fengyu Tower, who had only reached the Body Tempering Realm, was the most pitiful. Faced with the dozens of zhang drop, he dared not jump. Yet Long Hui, growing impatient, kicked him down, killing him instantly.

Nu Lang and the others dared not voice their anger, their hearts filled with humiliation.
