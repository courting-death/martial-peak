## Chapter 2025 — Misunderstanding

Late at night in the Zhang Family manor's great hall.

The Zhang Family's old matron hosted a banquet to thank Yang Kai for that day's aid; only Yang Kai, the middle‑aged beauty, and the old matron sat at the table.

The young girl Zhang Ruoxi stood to the side, attending dutifully, holding a wine ewer and pouring for the three; whenever her bright eyes glanced at Yang Kai they were full of gratitude and admiration.

The girl was young—only sixteen or seventeen—right in the flush of youth and dreaming of heroes. Today Yang Kai had nearly single‑handedly annihilated the Lu family and avenged her Zhang family; how could she not revere him?

Of all the people she had ever encountered, perhaps only Zhang Gaoxuan had been the strongest — regrettably, her grandfather had perished in the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda.

Yang Kai also appeared young, yet his strength surpassed that of her grandfather, so she could not help but steal a few more glances; perhaps warmed by the wine, her small face flushed under the candlelight and she kept her head lowered, moving only to pour—appearing exceedingly obedient.

"The Zhang Family has little to offer—Benefactor, please don't stand on ceremony," the old matron said. Though her wounds had not yet healed, her face still glowed with health as she busied herself, warmly urging Yang Kai to eat and drink.

The middle‑aged beauty likewise busied herself with hosting.

"Madam, you are too kind—Benefactor is a title I cannot accept. If you do not mind, simply call me by my name," Yang Kai said awkwardly; he was uncomfortable being called Benefactor on every side.

After slaying Lu Baichuan, Yang Kai had intended to leave. Were it not for Zhang Ruoxi and the Ethereal Jade Disc, he would not have agreed to stay.

Yet he did not know how to raise the matter; instinct told him the Ethereal Jade Disc hid considerable secrets likely tied to the Zhang Family, and a rash question would do more harm than good, so he waited for a proper opportunity.

Thinking this, he glanced up at Zhang Ruoxi and happened to meet the girl's bright eyes watching him furtively.

Startled by his gaze, Zhang Ruoxi jerked and quickly bowed her head; her lovely face flushed vermilion.

Yang Kai let out a soft laugh and casually turned his gaze elsewhere.

The beauty sitting to Yang Kai's left had seen the whole scene; she smiled faintly, as if a thought had occurred to her.

"Madam, the matter with the Lu Family has been settled. As per the agreement I made with Brother Zhang, this may be considered the fulfillment of my promise." Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn as he spoke.

"Naturally," the old matron nodded.

"As for that Dao Origin Pill, once I find an alchemist to refine it I will hand it over to the Zhang Family—please rest assured," Yang Kai continued.

The matron chuckled. "I trust Benefactor's character, and our Zhang Family is not in haste. With our depleted talent, even if we obtained a Dao Origin Pill what would it change? So do not worry yourself—refine it when you have time."

"That is best," Yang Kai agreed.

At that moment the middle‑aged beauty—who had spoken little until then—suddenly said, "Brother Yang, though you are young, your cultivation is astonishing and your bearing heroic; I imagine there must be many women who admire you?"

Yang Kai was taken aback; he had not expected the woman to broach the subject.

The old matron's brow knit; though she felt the topic somewhat improper, she knew her daughter‑in‑law would not speak without cause and so merely sipped her wine.

The beauty watched his reaction and when Yang Kai paused her eyes softened with a look of recollection—she guessed that Yang Kai's romantic life was not empty.

Indeed, given his ability—reaching the Third Stage of the Void King Realm despite his youth—he had surely experienced much and would have met memorable women along the way.

If Yang Kai were truly inexperienced in matters of the heart that would be the strange thing.

The banquet fell into an odd, silent atmosphere as Yang Kai's memory stirred.

After a long sigh Yang Kai rose. "Madam, the night is late; I will retire. You were injured in battle—rest early to avoid aggravating your injuries."

The matron smiled and inclined her head. "Thank you for your concern, Benefactor. Ruoxi, take our guest to the guest room and attend well."

"Yes." Zhang Ruoxi set down the wine ewer and offered a graceful bow. "Please follow me, sir."

Yang Kai excused himself and followed Zhang Ruoxi.

After Yang Kai left, the matron shot the beauty a sharp look.

The beauty reddened with embarrassment. "Mother, I know I spoke improperly."

"Hmph! If you had angered our Benefactor I would not have spared you," the matron snorted.

The beauty nodded repeatedly.

"But... why were you probing those matters earlier?" the matron asked with a frown.

The beauty smiled faintly. "Did you not notice? Our Benefactor seemed to glance at Ruoxi several times."

"So what?" the matron retorted.

The beauty said, "Ruoxi may not be a breathtaking beauty, but she's still a pretty little thing—our Benefactor might have some interest in her."

The matron hesitated. "Impossible? Ruoxi is only a First Stage of the Saint King Realm; how could she catch the eye of our Benefactor?"

The beauty smiled, "Mother, men do not look only at cultivation; they look at feeling. If the feeling is right, low cultivation matters little; if the feeling is wrong, high cultivation means nothing."

The matron scolded, "Are you lecturing this old woman on matters of men and women?"

The beauty stuck out her tongue. "I would not dare—only our Zhang Family's strength is small after Gaoxuan's death. Though the Lu family is gone, other families still sit within a thousand li of here. If we have no powerful protector and a strong enemy comes, what then? And the three requests Zhang Gaoxuan secured from Benefactor have been used; we cannot call on him later."

"You mean..." the matron fell into thought.

"If we can tie our Zhang Family to him through some relationship, would he stand by idly when we are in trouble?" the beauty smiled. "Ruoxi is the key to binding him to us."

"I understand your meaning," the matron pondered. "If what you say is true, it might be a sound plan. Gaoxuan is dead; our family must find a way forward."

"Indeed. He is so young yet reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and from his actions today he seems more than an ordinary Third Stage. An ordinary Third Stage could not infiltrate the Lu estate and capture Lu Baichuan alive. With his aptitude, Dao Origin Realm is not impossible. If our Zhang Family could be connected to him, we might find shelter. Even if we stand alone, who would dare touch us then?"

Hearing this, the matron's eyes brightened; she was tempted. Around Fenglin City few families could claim ties to a Dao Origin Realm expert; with such backing a clan could be secure for a century.

Yet she hesitated: "That may be so, but what if our hopes are one‑sided and we offend the Benefactor?"

The beauty laughed softly. "Mother, we can try..."

She leaned close and whispered in the matron's ear.

The matron nodded and smiled. "Very well—do as you say. But this will trouble Ruoxi."

The beauty waved it off. "How could it trouble her? Benefactor is no villain—if Ruoxi truly follows him she will enjoy comfort. I will speak to her tonight."

"If she refuses, do not force her; I will not trade her happiness for the Zhang Family's future," the matron said.

...

Led by the girl, Yang Kai walked through the estate and soon arrived at a side chamber; she pushed open the door and deftly made the bed.

Along the way Yang Kai asked her a few questions, but the girl blushed easily and answered with a trembling voice; Yang Kai found it awkward to continue.

Once everything was in order, the girl bowed. "Sir, rest well. Ruoxi takes her leave."

"Thank you," Yang Kai inclined his head.

The girl hurried past him, and in the moonlight Yang Kai could plainly see her ears were flushed red.

After she left, Yang Kai surveyed the chamber and found its furnishings luxurious. He waved his hand and wove a sealing formation with his power and Divine Sense to block outside probing.

He sat cross‑legged on the bed and began to inspect today's gains.

The haul from the Lu family treasury need not be mentioned: the Source Crystals numbered over six hundred thousand.

Combined with Yang Kai's previous holdings, he now possessed roughly one million Lower‑Level Source Crystals.

There were also Secret Treasures in the treasury—mostly Void King‑Grade. Yang Kai glanced at them and casually tossed them into his Spatial Ring, while some rare ore he sent into the Small Xuan Realm, letting his Incarnation absorb and smelt them with the Heaven Devouring Battle Art.

He sorted the pills one by one and categorized them for future use.

Next he examined Lu Baichuan's Spatial Ring. Its contents were largely similar to the treasury's.

However, the Lei Feng Hammer and the Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade did pique Yang Kai's interest. The Lei Feng Hammer could wield the power of lightning—fierce and overwhelming—but as a Void King–grade secret treasure it could not be pushed beyond its inherent limits. 

The Silver Moon Purple Frost Blade, however, was able to stir faint threads of the Power of the Laws.
