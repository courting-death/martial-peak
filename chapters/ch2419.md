## Chapter 2419 — Kid, Are You Trying to Extort Me?

"Such petty tricks, and you dare show off!" Yao Zhuo sneered, grabbing the bead in his palm and squeezing it hard, his face full of mockery and ridicule.

But in the next instant, his expression changed drastically, as an incredibly terrifying force suddenly erupted from his palm. The strength was so overwhelming that even as a Second Stage Emperor Realm, he momentarily lost control of his mind.

"Emperor Extinction Pill!" Yao Zhuo was no stranger to the world. He immediately realized that the bead Yang Kai had thrown was no ordinary bead, but an Emperor Extinction Pill!

A bone-chilling cold instantly enveloped him. Yao Zhuo shivered, his hands and feet turning icy.

Immediately after, violent waves of power surged, and a beautiful phantom suddenly appeared before Yao Zhuo.

The moment the phantom appeared, all the experts of Ice Heart Valley were dumbfounded. Pairs of beautiful eyes stared at the phantom, their delicate bodies trembling violently.

"Master..." An Ruoyun's hand lost all strength. She simply stared blankly at the figure and face she had longed for over three thousand years, unable to suppress her excitement no matter how hard she tried.

Sun Yunxiu, Changsun Ying, and the others were all the same. Their Emperor Realm auras collapsed, and they fell from midair, gazing at the phantom, calling out "Master" and "Teacher" one after another.

"Bing Yun!" Yao Zhuo looked as if he had seen a ghost in broad daylight, staring at the phantom with a pale face. He had dealt with Bing Yun in the past and naturally recognized the phantom at a glance. This meant that the Emperor Extinction Pill was refined by Bing Yun.

A low chant suddenly rang out. Though soft, it echoed throughout the entire Ice Heart Valley, shaking everyone's heart and soul.

"Ice Snow Pear Blossom Sword!"

Accompanying the chant, a longsword formed purely of energy suddenly appeared in the phantom's hand. Pure white and flawless, the sword trembled, enveloping Yao Zhuo's vital points, its strike as fierce as a dragon.

Yao Zhuo was shocked, letting out a low roar. A long halberd appeared in his hand, and with wide, sweeping movements, he mustered all his strength to defend with his life.

A series of crisp clangs rang out. Imperial Might clashed and spread, Emperor Intent splattered through the void, and the laws of heaven and earth shattered with a roar.

In less than ten breaths, Yao Zhuo suddenly retreated, gasping for air. The phantom of Bing Yun sheathed the sword and turned its head, as if sentient, glancing at An Ruoyun, Sun Yunxiu, and the others before shattering and dissipating into countless motes of light.

Yang Kai's eyes widened in astonishment.

He had used an Emperor Extinction Pill once before. That time, the pill from the Great Emperor of Time was magnificent, filled with the power of the four seasons, allowing him to comprehend the Martial Dao under the power of time and break through to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Compared to last time, this was child's play.

Although Bing Yun’s sword intent was extraordinary and her technique remarkable, in every aspect, it could not compare to the Emperor Extinction Pill of the Great Emperor of Time.

Moreover, it only lasted for ten breaths before vanishing.

Was this the difference between an ordinary Emperor and a Great Emperor? But when refining the Emperor Extinction Pill, both were at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. By reason, their power should have been similar.

Looking around, Yang Kai noticed that although Yao Zhuo appeared disheveled, there wasn’t a single sign of injury on him. How could this be?

Just as Yang Kai was full of suspicion, Yao Zhuo’s face suddenly turned pale, and with a muffled groan, pear blossom-shaped ice flowers suddenly appeared all over his body.

Each pear blossom was as white as snow, dotting Yao Zhuo’s shoulders, waist, arms, and legs, making it look as if he had picked many pear blossoms and stuck them on himself—vivid and lifelike.

As these pear blossoms appeared, Yao Zhuo felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar. His whole body trembled violently, and his lips turned purple from the cold.

“Senior Uncle!” Feng Xi cried out in panic.

Yao Zhuo couldn’t utter a word from the cold, his whole body wrapped in icy laws. After a long while, he suddenly roared, and with a surge of Emperor Yuan, shattered the ice pear blossoms covering him, returning to normal.

But his aura had already fallen to rock bottom. He looked extremely weak, and as soon as he opened his mouth, a mouthful of fresh blood sprayed out—clearly, he was severely injured.

Feng Xi hurried forward to support him.

“Valley Lord An, Elder Sun, is this how your Ice Heart Valley treats its guests?” Yao Zhuo forced himself to stay upright, gritting his teeth as he questioned An Ruoyun and Sun Yunxiu.

An Ruoyun frowned, her voice icy: “If you were truly guests, Ice Heart Valley would never neglect you!”

The implication was clear: Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi were not considered guests of Ice Heart Valley.

Yao Zhuo’s face twisted with anger, nearly coughing up blood again. Gritting his teeth, he snapped, “In two days, it will be Xi’er and your sect’s Ziyu’s wedding—the joyous union of our two families. Valley Lord An, how can you be so heartless?”

“Zi Yu is my disciple. Without my consent, she will not marry anyone!” An Ruoyun snorted coldly.

Yao Zhuo was stunned. He had never seen An Ruoyun so forceful. In his impression, she was gentle, even weak, but today she seemed like a different person.

He naturally knew the reason for her change—it was clearly because of news about Bing Yun. He sneered inwardly, secretly despising her for becoming tough now that she had backing. He said coldly, “This matter was personally agreed to by your Great Elder. We have already informed all the major sects of the Northern Territory. How can Valley Lord An deny it with a single word? If word gets out, all the powerful forces will laugh at Ice Heart Valley for going back on its word.”

Sun Yunxiu stepped forward and said coldly, “I did agree before, but now I regret it. The marriage between Zi Yu and the Young Sect Master is hereby canceled. I will take full responsibility!”

Yao Zhuo was dumbfounded, his mind buzzing. He pointed at Sun Yunxiu, his hand trembling, unable to speak for a long time. Clearly, he was furious. He never expected that such a major event could be canceled just because Sun Yunxiu changed her mind.

Ice Heart Valley could afford to lose face, but Wenqing Sect could not. If the marriage failed to happen in two days, it would be Wenqing Sect who became the laughingstock of the entire Northern Territory.

At this, Feng Xi’s face darkened with anger. He barked, “Elder Sun, how can you go back on your word like this? A true man stands by his promises—once spoken, it’s as solid as iron! How could you break faith so easily?”

Sun Yunxiu looked at him strangely and said lightly, “What makes you think I’m a true man? I am a woman!”

Feng Xi was speechless. He had been so angry that he spoke without thinking. As soon as the words left his mouth, he knew something was wrong, but it was too late to take them back. He could only grit his teeth and say, “Fine, I understand your attitude. In two days, my father will come in person. I hope your explanations will satisfy him. Farewell!”

With that, he shot a venomous glare at Yang Kai, then helped Yao Zhuo out. With things having escalated to this point, neither he nor Yao Zhuo had the face to remain as guests in Ice Heart Valley and could only leave.

The women of Ice Heart Valley all turned pale when they heard that the Wenqing Sect Master would come in person in two days. Clearly, they were extremely wary of him.

Yang Kai’s face was cold as he watched Feng Xi and Yao Zhuo, murderous intent surging in his heart. If he hadn’t used the Emperor Extinction Pill given to him by Bing Yun at the critical moment, he would have been skinned alive today, if not dead.

Wasting an Emperor Extinction Pill like this—how could he let these two leave unscathed? They had to pay a price. So before they could turn around, Yang Kai shouted, “You think you can just leave? How naive!”

Everyone’s expression changed at his words.

Only now did the women of Ice Heart Valley realize how bold Yang Kai was. With things having escalated so far, it would be best to end things peacefully, but Yang Kai clearly had no intention of letting it go.

He was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—how could he dare challenge a Second Stage Emperor Realm? Did he have more Emperor Extinction Pills? Even if he did, he was in no condition to use them now.

Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi had no idea what Yang Kai was up to. They stopped in their tracks, Feng Xi glaring at him as if he wanted to skin him alive.

Yao Zhuo snorted coldly, “We’ve already lost today. Kid, what more do you want?”

Yang Kai gave a cold, mocking smile. “Vice Sect Master, you look ready to eat someone alive! Just now, you shamelessly bullied me, relying on your strength to strike at me. I was scared half to death—my soul still hasn’t returned, wandering who knows where. I fear my three souls and seven spirits will never be whole again, and my bright future has been ruined in an instant. Vice Sect Master, you’ve left me with an indelible trauma—don’t you think you should at least offer some compensation?”

With a collective gasp, all the women of Ice Heart Valley nearly fainted on the spot, their expressions a mix of disbelief and amusement as they stared at Yang Kai.

What being scared half to death, what soul not returning, what irreparable trauma—this was all nonsense. Yao Zhuo hadn’t even fought Yang Kai directly; he just used an Emperor Extinction Pill to resolve the crisis. How could he have been traumatized? This kid was lying through his teeth without even blushing.

The women of Ice Heart Valley couldn’t help but marvel at the spectacle, secretly thinking to themselves: so this is how thick someone’s skin can be! 

Feng Xi shouted angrily, “You look perfectly fine to me—what trauma?”

Yang Kai snorted, “Young Sect Master, don’t talk nonsense. My head is spinning, and I’m about to collapse. Can’t you see, or are your eyes on your ass?”

“You, you…” Feng Xi had never seen such shamelessness and was momentarily at a loss for words.

The women of Ice Heart Valley blushed, secretly thinking Yang Kai’s words were so crude, it was disgraceful.

Yao Zhuo thought for a while, then suddenly realized, “Kid, are you trying to extort me?”

Yang Kai said, “Vice Sect Master, why put it so harshly? A life for a life, a debt repaid in kind—that’s only right. You’ve damaged my foundation and ended my Martial Dao. I won’t stoop to your level, but it’s only fair you offer some compensation, isn’t it?”

“Isn’t this extortion?” Yao Zhuo shouted angrily.

Yang Kai frowned, rubbing his chin and pondering for a moment before sighing, “Fine, I am extorting you. What are you going to do about it, Vice Sect Master? Bite me!”
