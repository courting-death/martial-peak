## Chapter 1866 — Settled?

Yang Kai looked at him and smiled faintly. "Why are you asking about this?"

Zi Wuji said in a deep voice, "The Lost Realm was so perilous that even a figure like my father, who once shaped the heavens and earth, has fallen—Eldest Brother should not be safe. If he lived, perhaps it was thanks to the Venerable One; so now, the whereabouts of my Eldest Brother can only be known to you, Venerable One."

Yang Kai’s lip curled. “And what if he is? What now—does Young Master Wuji expect me to hand your Eldest Brother over for you to deal with as you please?”

Zi Wuji waved his hand in alarm. "I dare not! I would never think such a thing. Eldest Brother and I are of the same blood; with my father fallen, how could I harbor other thoughts toward Eldest Brother? I only wished to ask, Venerable One, did you come to Purple Star at Eldest Brother's behest?"

Yang Kai gave a cold laugh. “What a joke. With my status, even if he is Purple Star’s Young Master, he has no right to question my actions.”

Zi Wuji was overjoyed. "Then it will be easy. Since the Venerable One had a life‑and‑death bond with my father, you certainly would not bear to see Purple Star fall into others' hands. If that happened, how could my father rest in peace? Please, Venerable One, help me!"

Yang Kai fell silent, appearing lost in thought.

Seeing a chance, Zi Wuji hurried to press it while it was hot. "Since the Venerable One has met my Eldest Brother, you must know his character—who, in your view, is most suitable to sit upon the lordship of Purple Star?"

As he spoke, Zi Wuji no longer hid his ambition; his eyes glittered with longing.

Yang Kai said lightly, “Zi Donglai may have decent aptitude, but in terms of steadiness and scheming, he falls far short of you. He might grow into a strong cultivator, but he will never become a ruler in his own right.”

"Thanks for the praise, Venerable One!" Zi Wuji accepted the compliment without modesty and then said in a hushed tone, "Venerable One, my Father and Eldest Brother have been missing for nearly two years. Though their influence remains, the Great Elder has been acting restless. If we delay further, Purple Star will be in danger. Since the Venerable One accepted my Father's token, I will naturally treat you as one of us. With your aid, great things can be achieved."

"You so confident?" Yang Kai frowned.

Zi Wuji smiled confidently. "In Purple Star, the Zi family are the rightful lineage! I have hidden my light for so many years, and now I dare to step forward to confront that old lecher. Of course I'm not empty‑handed. What is lacking is merely a key figure who can match that old man! Your arrival gives me hope."

Yang Kai looked at Zi Wuji with some surprise, realizing he had underestimated the man. From his tone it seemed Zi Wuji had already gathered many powerful experts to serve him.

He was too lazy to bother with Purple Star's disputes—his aim was only the Star Emperor Token—yet last time his probe into the Purple Star palace had stirred the hornet's nest. If he could this time use Zi Wuji's hands to get that thing out, it would be a convenient method.

With that thought, Yang Kai pretended to ponder.

Zi Wuji did not dare interrupt and stood anxiously waiting.

After a long while, just as Zi Wuji grew restless, Yang Kai finally spoke. "Young Master Zi, you are so candid and so astute; this pleases me. I believe that if Zi Long knew in the afterlife, he could rest in peace with a smile."

"Venerable One, do you mean…?" Zi Wuji looked at Yang Kai with both shock and joy.

"I can help you, it's not impossible. As a Venerable One, I should lend Purple Star some aid. I am not heartless; I cannot watch Purple Star's foundation fall into others' hands. However…"

"State your demands; if Young Master Zi can manage them, he will never refuse!" Zi Wuji eagerly cut in before Yang Kai finished.

"Good." Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction. "I have only two demands. The first is that I must enter your Purple Star Treasure Vault and take one item—something your father promised me."

"The Treasure Vault!" Zi Wuji's expression changed, then he forced a bitter smile. "Venerable One, you may not know, but I know a little about the Purple Star Treasure Vault. It lies in the most heavily protected area of the Purple Star Palace. Though I can approach it, without the key it cannot be opened. I have never entered the Treasure Vault—only my father and Eldest Brother have."

"I have the key," Yang Kai said. "Second Young Master need not trouble himself with that."

Zi Wuji was astonished. "Father's key is in the Venerable One's hands?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

Zi Wuji's face shifted as if struck by a thought, but he quickly composed himself and inclined his head. "If so, this matter is not hard. As the Second Young Master I have the right to approach the Treasure Vault. Leave it to me."

"Good." Yang Kai nodded. "The second matter is that you must release those people from the Hengluo Commerce Guild."

Zi Wuji's face fell and he said helplessly, "Venerable One, you don't know—those people were not imprisoned by me but by the Great Elder. The guards are all his confidants."

"I know he did it." Yang Kai snorted coldly. "The Second Young Master is busied with his own affairs and hasn't time to capture Hengluo Commerce Guild people. Still, I am curious—why would the Great Elder do this?"

Zi Wuji's expression grew dark. "If I am not wrong, it is likely the old lecher's scheme aimed at me."

"Tell the details!" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"The Hengluo Commerce Guild is a behemoth, mightier than Purple Star in many respects," Zi Wuji murmured. "Among the people who came to Purple Star this time, the leader seemed to be the guild president's son. The Great Elder detained him—that will draw Hengluo's attention and they will act. This matter can be as big or as small as one makes it. At worst it's a clash between two great forces and could spark war; at best it is insignificant so long as none of their people are killed. If Hengluo learns of it and comes to demand someone, the Great Elder can hand out a scapegoat to defuse the crisis. Of course the scapegoat must carry weight—throwing out some nobody won't calm Hengluo's fury."

Yang Kai understood in his heart. "So the scapegoat would likely be you."

"Who else in Purple Star could bear that role?" Zi Wuji scoffed. "If I am handed over, Purple Star might as well change its name."

"So that's it." Yang Kai finally understood why Purple Star had suddenly targeted Shen Tu and the others—it was the Great Elder's means of dealing with Zi Wuji. Shen Tu had simply walked straight into the whirlpool of trouble.

"Therefore, if the Venerable One wants to save them, you must first deal with that old lecher!"

"I understand." Yang Kai nodded.

"Venerable One, do you know those from the Hengluo Commerce Guild?" Zi Wuji could not restrain his curiosity and asked.

Yang Kai glanced at him coolly.

Zi Wuji hung his head and laughed awkwardly. "I spoke out of turn."

"Now I want to know how the Second Young Master plans to deal with the Great Elder. Don't tell me you have no complete plan."

"Of course not!" Zi Wuji's face lit with excitement. "I've prepared for a long time, waiting for this day. With the Venerable One's help, great things will surely be achieved. My plan is as follows…"

Zi Wuji then laid out his scheme in full.

Yang Kai listened without betraying his thoughts, secretly impressed. He had never expected Zi Wuji to have patiently hidden himself away until now, and that the Purple Star would contain so many powerful experts whom Zi Wuji had brought under his sway.

The boy's long patience had indeed paid off.

After listening, Yang Kai silently calculated and found the plan was not far from the mark. He looked at Zi Wuji with newfound respect. "If Purple Star comes under the Second Young Master's control, its future will surely be glorious."

"You flatter me, Venerable One." Zi Wuji smiled modestly.

"Well, it's late. We'll leave it at that for today. When the day comes, I will seek out the Second Young Master myself."

"Young Master Zi sees the Venerable One off!" Zi Wuji rose and bowed deeply.

Stepping out of the room, Yang Kai greeted Li Nuo and then, accompanied by Hua Youmeng, walked toward the Commerce Guild.

In the side chamber Zi Wuji could no longer hide the joy between his brows and chuckled silently.

Ji Jun entered, saw his expression, and exclaimed with delight, "Young Master, have you concluded terms with that great man?"

Zi Wuji nodded.

Ji Jun struck his right fist against his left palm and said excitedly, "Wonderful. After sulking all these days we can finally hold our heads high. But Young Master, is that great man trustworthy?"

Hearing Ji Jun, Zi Wuji restrained the joy on his face. "He should be. This lord holds no deep allegiance to Purple Star, so he won’t stand firmly on anyone’s side. As long as I can meet his conditions, he can be used by me. But even so, we must remain cautious… Elder Ji, come with me back to Purple Star Palace — we should visit my mother.”

Ji Jun's expression grew solemn. "Young Master, do you intend to ask that great man to take action?"

Zi Wuji said, "Yes. Purple Star has more than one Venerable One."

After returning to the Commerce Guild with Hua Youmeng, Yang Kai entered seclusion and instructed the people of the Commerce Guild not to wander about for a while.

In truth, he need not have warned them—when Hua Youmeng returned with over two hundred million Saint Crystals, Xia Jingwu and the others were stunned.

They had only ever heard of such vast quantities of Saint Crystals in others' talk; they never had dared imagine possessing them, yet now they lay before them in reality.

No one dared believe it was true.

After more than half a day they accepted the reality and, under Hua Youmeng's direction, set aside twenty million Saint Crystals to purchase precious cultivation materials.

In the days that followed, the members of the Commerce Guild all entered seclusion to cultivate; who had time to run about?
