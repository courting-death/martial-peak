## Chapter 706 — Stirring Up Trouble on Tai Sui's Head

Nie Chufeng had cultivation at the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm; though such a level was not particularly powerful across the Tongxuan Continent, she had, after all, stepped into the ranks of the Transcendent Realm.

Zhai Yao and Yang Kai were on the same level—both had reached the pinnacle of the Divine Roaming Realm. The gap in their strength was considerable; the moment Nie Chufeng circulated her True Yuan, Zhai Yao's expression turned grave.

Before the woman could strike, Zhai Yao abruptly raised his hand and launched an object that flew straight toward Nie Chufeng.

Quick-eyed and quick-handed, Nie Chufeng clamped it in her palm; a single glance made her face change dramatically.

"Golden Dragon Token?" Nie Cong also cried out in alarm.

"No wonder he's so arrogant—this brat has the Golden Dragon Token of Fuyun City’s lord." Fei Yu instantly realized, her gaze fixed on the token pinched in Nie Chufeng's hand as her red lips trembled a few times.

"His backing is indeed not small," Yang Kai chuckled.

Possessing the Golden Dragon Token of Fuyun City's lord was tantamount to being that lord's honored guest. Though Yang Kai did not know what sort of relationship Zhai Yao had with the lord of Fuyun City, he had heard of the methods and might of that demon Saint Realm expert Ao Gu.

Once the Golden Dragon Token was recognized, the murderous intent and momentum radiating from Nie Chufeng collapsed like a punctured balloon, instantly wilting; her beautiful eyes stared at Zhai Yao in stupefaction as she demanded, "Where did you get that Golden Dragon Token?"

She found it hard to believe that such a young man could have ties with the demon Ao Gu.

Zhai Yao shrugged. "Senior Ao Gu gave it to me. If you don't believe me, you can go ask him yourself."

"I will ask." Nie Chufeng's expression flickered unpredictably; she suddenly waved to a warrior nearby and ordered, "Go and summon Deputy City Lord Zhou Liang."

"Yes!" The man answered and sped away like lightning.

The scene froze in an instant. The onlookers whispered among themselves, stunned and bewildered.

Nie Chufeng appraised Zhai Yao from head to toe; a very complicated look flashed across her beautiful eyes. His producing the Golden Dragon Token truly made her hesitate to act rashly.

"Aunt, you must kill him!" Nie Cong hissed, his voice low and fierce, his expression savage, his gaze full of hatred and malice.

"But he has the Golden Dragon Token!" Nie Chufeng shook her head slowly, her dark brows knitting.

"So what?" Nie Cong ground his teeth and growled. "Just because he has a Golden Dragon Token, does that mean my severed-arm grievance can be forgotten? No matter what, he must die!"

Nie Chufeng opened her mouth to dissuade him, but seeing the pain on Nie Cong's face, fury instantly swelled in her heart.

From childhood, Nie Cong had grown under her care and had never suffered grievances; within Fuyun City, merely mentioning Master Nie Cong's name would make anyone yield in deference three times, and he had never known disappointment.

Yet today, one of his hands had been cut off.

"Do you truly want him dead?" A dangerous glint gradually surfaced in Nie Chufeng's beautiful eyes.

"He must die. Only then will my hatred be avenged!"

"Very well, your aunt will grant you that." Nie Chufeng's face went cold as she made the decision. To kill such a man she must act before Zhou Liang arrived; otherwise, once he came it might be too late.

As for who this youth really was or what relation he had with Ao Gu, those questions need not be considered.

If Zhou Liang could put in a good word with Ao Gu, the matter could be smoothed over. After all, this youngster was merely a guest of Ao Gu.

Ao Gu would not bother to tear his relationship with Zhou Liang apart over someone like this, would he?

With that thought in her heart, Nie Chufeng no longer hesitated. A surge of emerald True Yuan flowed from her body and, before anyone could react, took the form of a venomous serpent in midair, writhing and snapping toward Zhai Yao.

Zhai Yao's face changed; heated True Yuan burst forth from his body, roaring flames wrapping him in three layers inside and out.

The emerald serpent bared its fangs, broke through the fiery barrier, and lunged at Zhai Yao with hideous ferocity; from its maw foul stenches sprayed, corroding Zhai Yao's True Yuan flames.

In an instant Zhai Yao's True Yuan defense was breached; the serpent darted in, and Zhai Yao's pupils contracted as he flashed aside, narrowly avoiding a killing strike.

Before he could regain his footing, emerald serpents erupted from the ground in great numbers, attacking from all sides and encircling him without a gap.

Zhai Yao's panicked expression suddenly steadied; like a phantom he pushed his agility to the extreme, and at that moment countless afterimages of him appeared in the surroundings.

The onlookers uttered exclamations of surprise—they had not expected this young man could remain safe under Nie Chufeng's assault.

Before anyone recovered, an earth-shattering fluctuation suddenly exploded somewhere on the inn's third floor; a power that rent the heavens shook through, sending visible ripples outward. Those ripples contained a most profound power, and the emerald serpents affected by them soon wilted, reverting to emerald True Yuan and being burned away clean.

A dazzling light flared out like the keenest blade, scattering in ten directions.

As if sun and moon had been shattered, a brilliance of ten thousand rays ripped the emerald True Yuan apart and purified it; the scene instantly cleared.

When everyone regained their senses, they found another young man standing before Zhai Yao—none other than the one who had earlier contended with him for the Earthfire Core in the trading district.

"Brother Yang..." Zhai Yao gazed at Yang Kai's back and twitched the corner of his mouth, revealing a trace of unwillingness on his face.

The instantaneous eruption of power had let him perceive Yang Kai's formidable martial strength; he had assumed a pill alchemist like Yang Kai could not excel in combat, yet the other's combat ability was even more terrifying than his own.

Inferior in alchemy and weaker in combat, Zhai Yao was struck hard.

Yang Kai frowned, helpless to the extreme.

If it were possible, he would not have wanted trouble, but judging by Nie Chufeng and Nie Cong's manner, even if he hid himself, sooner or later they would come after him.

In truth, the enmity had been destined since the moment he had fought Nie Cong for the Earthfire Core in the trading district.

Tianxiao Sect's four Guardians could likely not contend with a Saint Realm expert from Fuyun City; Yang Kai could only put his hopes in Zhai Yao now.

This kid was secretive—surely he had backing, perhaps enough to resolve the current predicament.

Realizing this, Yang Kai decisively acted.

Fei Yu lightly descended from the window and stood smiling before the two young men, gnashing her silver teeth as she taunted, "Looks like this kid's in trouble."

Zhai Yao sneered, "She can't kill me."

"Oh? Not old but arrogant—just like my damned little junior nephew." Fei Yu laughed coquettishly.

"Aunt, these two are his companions." Nie Cong, seeing Yang Kai, roared angrily and pointed at Yang Kai and Fei Yu, his eyes nearly popping from their sockets.

Yang Kai's expression remained indifferent. In the trading district he had merely given Nie Cong a single punch and had not truly harmed him, but the other's grudging memory left Yang Kai with no choice.

"Rest assured, Aunt will avenge you." Nie Chufeng's pretty face chilled as she suddenly waved her hand, "Kill them all!"

At her command, the warriors she had brought unleashed their True Yuan and charged at Fei Yu and the other two.

Fei Yu's smiling face showed no alarm at all as a dozen attackers rushed in; a subtle, sinuous power flowed from her, causing a dense mist to quickly fill the area.

The mist condensed into droplets that Fei Yu controlled into roaring, momentum-filled attacks that met the dozen warriors head-on.

"Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm?" Nie Chufeng's pretty face changed.

The moment Fei Yu acted, Nie Chufeng perceived the vast gap between them and realized she would likely be unable to help Nie Cong avenge his grievance.

Among those Nie Chufeng had brought, the strongest was only at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm; two others were at the First Stage, and the rest were all at the Divine Roaming Realm.

Such foundations were indeed insufficient before a Third Stage expert.

Her face clouded with gloom, Nie Chufeng's heart boiled with fury.

For many years no one within Fuyun City had dared offend her—thanks to Zhou Liang's protection—even those Third Stage experts treated her with courtesy.

But now the situation had turned sharply against her.

These detestable outsiders actually dared to act so brazenly in her territory—truly they had a death wish.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

The droplet attacks struck like a storm; the charging warriors screamed and were thrown to the ground, only the three Transcendent Realm cultivators escaped.

Fei Yu did not strike to kill—this was another's territory after all; she merely taught them a lesson so they would know to back off.

Having witnessed Fei Yu's methods, the three who escaped now looked ill; when they glanced at Fei Yu again their eyes were full of fear.

"Still want to press on?" Fei Yu asked with a languid smile, asking calmly, "Next time I won't be so gentle."

"Aunt!" Nie Cong cried out.

Nie Chufeng's face shifted wildly; as she wondered how to act, a roar suddenly rang out: "Everyone, stop!"

The moment the voice reached their ears, a surging, overwhelming aura descended from above, so oppressive it left all breathless.

Immediately a figure rapidly approached from the distance and soon descended into the center of the scene.

Nie Chufeng's eyes brightened and she quickly forced a smile, as if seeing a savior, calling softly, "Zhou Liang!"

Zhou Liang glanced at her coldly, then turned his gaze to Zhai Yao, who was being shielded by Fei Yu and Yang Kai, and strode over to him with a sullen expression.

Fei Yu and Yang Kai both narrowed their eyes; their auras writhed and coiled like the core of a serpent, fluctuating uncertainly.

Nie Chufeng's heart leapt—she believed Zhou Liang had come to vent her grievances for her—and she lightly patted Nie Cong's head, signaling him to remain calm.

Nie Cong sneered and widened his eyes, eager to see how those who had provoked him would meet their end.

Zhou Liang doted on Nie Chufeng; when the beauty made a request he always handled it, and this time would be no exception.

Full of confidence, Nie Cong's lips curled into a vicious and gloating smile.
