## Chapter 647 — Is He This Strong?

Seeing the changes this Demon Clan warrior underwent, Yang Kai's expression remained indifferent, but he was extremely surprised inwardly.

These vein-like markings were something he had seen on many Demon Clan members before, though many others did not exhibit them—for example Li Rong and Guan'er; at least on their exposed skin Yang Kai had seen no markings.

Now it seemed it was not that they lacked them, but that, like the demon before him, they could extend and retract them at will.

Once those markings surged forth, the Demon Clan warrior's strength would rise a whole tier!

The opponent's momentum billowed like a torrent; Pan Lang and the others wore calm, composed faces, looking on as if Yang Kai were about to suffer a great loss, secretly delighted.

Yang Kai drew a deep breath and did not evade; instead, to everyone's surprise, he charged straight at him.

He deliberately wanted to test how much this demon warrior's strength had increased.

Boom...

A tremendous crash rang out; a visible shockwave radiated outward from the two colliding figures, and Yang Kai flew backward on his back, flipping several times in midair before regaining his balance.

The demon warrior likewise kept retreating; though he tried to steady himself he failed, stepped back more than ten paces, fell on his back to the ground, and panted heavily.

Pan Lang and the others could not help but widen their eyes, looking at Yang Kai with some disbelief.

Although humans rarely appeared in the Small Xuan Realm, they all knew the Ancient Demon Clan's physical constitution surpassed every other race; even other demons could not be compared to them.

Yet now, in a direct clash, their companion was actually matched blow for blow with a human.

Pan Lang was greatly enraged and shouted, "What are you doing? Can't even take down a human?"

The demon warrior who had fallen to the ground rose a second time, shook his head, paying no heed to his injuries and broken bones, and muttered, "This kid's physique is pretty good too."

"What body could possibly compare to our Ancient Demon Clan?" Pan Lang snarled. "You have one more chance to prove yourself. If you fail again, you will have no qualification to operate with me anymore; you will be demoted to an ordinary clansman."

"Don't worry, this time I'll deal with him properly!" the demon warrior nodded gravely. As he spoke, the markings on his face changed in an unusual way, seeming to melt and spread across his entire face like a mask; his expression went blank, but his blood-red eyes exuded a cold murderous intent.

The two prior failed attempts had already stoked his true anger.

Yang Kai hovered in midair, watching coldly, increasingly astonished.

Only now did he truly realize how formidable the bodies of the Demon Clan people living in the Small Xuan Realm were; the demon who had been sparring with him was only at Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage, the same level as him, yet could repeatedly raise his momentum and strength — such means were truly terrifying.

A cultivator of the same rank outside would have been unable to stand after Yang Kai's first hit, but this demon had been grievously wounded twice and still remained vigorous.

The bodies of the Ancient Demon Clan seemed to contain an extremely terrifying potential!

From Pan Lang and the others' attitude and words, Yang Kai also realized that the Ancient Demon Clan's warriors were bloodthirsty warmongers; when one of their comrades had a row of ribs broken by him, they showed no concern, instead goading him to reclaim face.

This race truly differed greatly from humans, Yang Kai thought, silently shaking his head.

Over there, the demon warrior launched another attack; a dull air-explosion sounded under his feet, and his burly body suddenly vanished from Yang Kai's sight.

His speed reached an extreme; he had rendered his body indistinct.

Pan Lang nodded slightly. "The demonic markings' second expansion — this human kid is going to be in trouble!"

No sooner had he finished speaking than another thunderous impact echoed out.

The disappeared demon warrior reappeared, one leg raised high and pressed down on Yang Kai's shoulder; his expression was sinister, his eyes filled with resentment and defiance, as he unleashed his full strength.

The stone slabs beneath Yang Kai turned to powder for over ten zhang, yet he remained unmoving like a mountain, gazing indifferently at the demon; to the latter's astonishment, Yang Kai grabbed his ankle, spun him like a windwheel a few times, and hurled him upward.

The demon cried out as True Yuan gushed from the acupoints of his body, attempting to stop his ascent; before he could stabilize, his chest and abdomen were suddenly struck by heavy, continuous blows.

Twisting his head with difficulty, he saw that the human kid had actually followed him the whole way, and was now mercilessly beating him down while he could not steady himself.

His fists were swung so fast their trajectories were indistinguishable; a skyful of fist shadows danced forth.

From his fists poured surges of pure, burning True Yuan which, upon colliding with his demonic qi, caused that qi to instinctively recoil in dread.

Boom, boom, boom...

The explosive sounds continued one after another; Yang Kai kept his head down and attacked fiercely. Though his face showed no expression, in his heart he admired this demon warrior greatly.

Such an assault would overwhelm even a human of Transcendent Realm, yet this demon had endured it.

Only when he hit the ground did the demon widen his eyes and stare at Yang Kai in disbelief, still clutching Yang Kai's clothes with both hands, utterly unwilling to accept defeat.

Yang Kai delivered another punch that struck his face.

Several teeth flew out; that punch should have been the final straw. As the fist retreated, the demon's momentum collapsed, he went limp and motionless, and the demonic markings on his face quickly faded.

Yang Kai slowly stood up and coldly glanced up at Pan Lang and the others not far away.

Even though their comrade had been beaten so, they had no intention of stepping in to help, merely watching the spectacle at the side.

Yet whether it was Pan Lang or the other demons, surprise washed over all their faces. They had never expected this human cultivator's combat power to be so formidable, and his bloody, direct fighting style suited their tastes.

"Interesting — it seems we all underestimated you!" Pan Lang lightly clapped his hands. "But the one you beat was only the weakest among us; you won't be so lucky with the next one."

Saying this, Pan Lang signaled with his eyes to another demon warrior, who immediately stepped forward.

"No need to make things complicated; all of you come at me together!" Yang Kai shrugged. Months immersed in alchemy had left him without sparring, and this fight was exhilarating; the battle intent surging within him burned fiercely and his strength writhed to be unleashed.

He loved fighting!

Especially fighting formidable opponents — that feeling made him extremely comfortable.

Pan Lang laughed loudly. "We won't bully you like that. If it were a life-or-death battle that would be different, but to merely teach you a lesson we need not all intervene."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai drew a deep breath and unleashed all his strength without reserve; ferocious and without words, his figure blurred as he charged at the cluster of demon warriors.

Scorching True Yuan instantly enveloped him, and under Yang Kai's precise, subtle control his attacks simultaneously struck the remaining five or six.

Pan Lang roared in fury, "You truly have no sense of your place!"

As he shouted, the demonic markings appeared on the necks of those five or six, crawling up to cover their faces entirely.

Though they spoke lightly, Pan Lang and the others knew Yang Kai was not easy to contend with; a slight mistake could see them knocked down, so when they struck they used their full strength.

What Pan Lang worried about most was that this human cultivator's True Yuan seemed to suppress their demonic qi, giving him a multiplied effect when dealing with his kind.

A chaotic free-for-all quickly erupted; Yang Kai faced many alone, unafraid, actually excited, his battle intent soaring.

He had been pent up for too long; he felt that if he did not use this opportunity to vent months of boredom, sooner or later he would be unable to stop himself from starting fights.

Pan Lang and the others' provocations were exactly what he wanted.

Various exquisite Martial Skills shone brilliantly within the stone chamber, and Yang Kai thoroughly learned the Ancient Demon Clan's fierce combat power. Time passed bit by bit, and the commotion gradually subsided.

...

When Guan'er pushed open the stone chamber door, her beautiful eyes abruptly constricted as she looked at the shattered scene inside and stood stunned for a moment.

Over these months Yang Kai, this outsider, had behaved quite obediently and shown no thought of escape, so Guan'er naturally no longer had to watch him every moment.

She had not expected such a major incident to occur this time.

Six or seven clansmen lay or crawled on the ground in miserable condition; the stone chamber was littered with traces of battle and blotches of blood.

"What happened?" Guan'er cried, rushing in to check on her clansmen. After examining them she discovered each had been severely wounded; the worst had half his body bones shattered — such injuries would take at least half a year to fully recover even with the Ancient Demon Clan's physique. The least injured still had more than ten broken bones, his body covered in wounds, flesh torn — a pitiable sight.

"Pan Lang?" Upon checking the last person, Guan'er covered her mouth.

Looking up, Guan'er immediately saw Yang Kai sitting cross-legged on that bed, maintaining a meditative posture, his body still bearing signs of the battle.

Although Guan'er disliked Pan Lang, these were after all her clansmen; Yang Kai clearly looked like the ringleader who injured them, so Guan'er naturally wanted to ask for an explanation.

Before she could rush over, Lady Li's voice came to her ear: "Do not disturb him; he seems about to breakthrough. Call some people to go in and quietly carry Pan Lang and the others away."

"Lady, but here..."

"I have learned how the matter went — Pan Lang and the others provoked first; it was not his fault!"

"I understand." Guan'er nodded lightly, staring blankly at Yang Kai, her beautiful eyes filled with confusion; from Lady Li's tone it seemed he had indeed beaten Pan Lang and the others.

This human kid — is he really this strong?
