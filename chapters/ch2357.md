## Chapter 2357 — Sneak Attack

"Senior, I obtained this by accident. It has nothing to do with my Senior Brother." Liu Qianyun suddenly interjected.

Her intention was clear—she didn’t want Yang Kai to be implicated because of her own affairs.

"You got it?" Yao Changjun asked, ignoring Yang Kai entirely and instead staring intently at Liu Qianyun.

Under his soul-piercing gaze, Liu Qianyun grew uneasy and nodded, "Yes."

"Where did you find it?" Yao Changjun asked urgently.

Liu Qianyun was stunned, looking at Yang Kai in confusion. He had just asked her the same question, but before she could answer, Pang Guang had interrupted. Now Yao Changjun was asking again—could there be some other treasure where it appeared? Otherwise, why would they both ask this question?

Though puzzled, she dared not delay and quickly replied, "It was in a place deep within Jixu Ridge."

"So it really was Jixu Ridge!" Yao Changjun gritted his teeth, as if he had expected this. His expression shifted, and he asked in a deep voice, "If you went again, could you find the place?"

Liu Qianyun said, "I don’t really remember the way."

"Useless!" Yao Changjun exploded in anger. His surging Imperial Might pressed down on Liu Qianyun like a tangible force. Her face flushed, her mind shook, and she coughed up a mouthful of blood.

At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly made his move.

This old monster Yao Changjun was definitely not someone to reason with. His temperament was so erratic, he was clearly a cruel man who cared nothing for others’ lives. It didn’t matter if he wanted Liu Qianyun to lead him to the Divine Butian Lotus—at worst, they could just take him there. The real fear was that he’d kill them after getting what he wanted.

Yang Kai figured there was an eighty to ninety percent chance he’d do just that.

So, in the instant Yao Changjun’s mind was shaken with rage, Yang Kai knew his chance had come.

Spatial power suddenly surged, freezing the surroundings. In a flick of his finger, Yang Kai sent several massive Moon Blades slashing toward Yao Changjun.

Yao Changjun was still seething with rage, never imagining Yang Kai would dare strike first. In his mind, a mere Third Stage Dao Origin Realm brat should already count himself lucky to remain at ease in front of him—how could he possibly have the nerve to attack?

So this attack caught him completely off guard.

The pitch-black Moon Blades reached Yao Changjun in an instant, threatening to slice him into pieces.

Yet Yao Changjun’s expression didn’t change. He sneered coldly, "Courting death!"

As he spoke, he reached out to grab the Moon Blade.

One of the Moon Blades was actually caught in his hand and crushed to pieces. Even Yang Kai’s Spatial Law was completely suppressed by a surge of overwhelming Imperial Might.

"Spatial Force?" Yao Changjun showed a hint of surprise, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment. "Kid, you’re interesting. What is Li Wuyi to you?"

"Your grandpa!" Yang Kai roared. In that instant, the World-Ending Demon Eye snapped open—its golden vertical pupil gleaming coldly. The secret art, Blooming Lotus, unfurled without warning, unleashing the full might of his Divine Soul. Like a tidal wave, his spiritual power surged forth, crashing directly into Yao Changjun’s Sea of Consciousness.

Yao Changjun never expected Yang Kai would dare use a Divine Soul secret technique against him. After all, their cultivation gap was so vast that normally, the weaker party would never attack the stronger with such methods—it would only backfire and destroy themselves.

But Yang Kai did it anyway.

What unsettled Yao Changjun even more was that this was now his greatest weakness.

It was as if Yang Kai had known this all along, so he showed no fear and used an extremely powerful Divine Soul secret technique.

Yao Changjun was struck instantly. The defenses of his Sea of Consciousness were torn apart, pain exploded in his head, and he clutched his skull, howling. His Origin Qi ran wild, completely out of control.

"Go!" Yang Kai shouted in a low voice. He reached for the jade box in Yao Changjun’s hand, snatching back the stolen Divine Butian Lotus. Without a moment’s delay, he grabbed the stunned Liu Qianyun, wrapped her in spatial power, and teleported away.

Boom—

As the two escaped, the Yueting Teahouse collapsed with a thunderous crash.

Yao Changjun’s rampaging Origin Qi took the form of dragons and tigers, smashing everything around him. The martial artists drinking tea inside were killed or wounded in droves, and countless shops on the street collapsed.

Dozens of streets away, Pang Guang, who had just managed to crawl up in a sorry state, looked over with a pale face and blurted, "Third Stage of the Emperor Realm!"

He hadn’t figured out Yao Changjun’s exact cultivation before, but now, with his Origin Qi raging, it was clear at a glance.

The owner of this Yueting Teahouse was actually a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert! Pang Guang’s heart was instantly thrown into turmoil.

He was the City Lord of Gao City, yet he hadn’t known such a top expert was hiding in his own city. The thought made him break out in a cold sweat, secretly glad he hadn’t provoked him earlier.

What Pang Guang found even harder to believe was—who could have injured Yao Changjun? Judging by his furious howls and current state, he was clearly badly hurt. Could it have been that young man? But that was impossible. The youth was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Even if Yao Changjun stood still and let him attack, he shouldn’t have been able to injure him.

Could it be that there was more than one Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert in Gao City? At this thought, Pang Guang’s face turned deathly pale, and he grew increasingly paranoid.

"Brat, you dare ambush me? You’re dead! I’ll never let you go!" A furious roar came from the ruins of the teahouse. Yao Changjun, murderous intent surging, finally managed to suppress the pain in his mind. Sensing the direction Yang Kai had fled, he shot after him like lightning.

He, a dignified Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, had actually been ambushed and injured by Yang Kai. If word got out, where would he put his dignity? He swore to himself that he would catch Yang Kai and make him suffer every torture imaginable to vent his hatred.

In the blink of an eye, Yao Changjun vanished from sight.

Pang Guang stood where he was, his expression shifting uncertainly. After a moment’s thought, he too flickered and flew out of the city.

Judging by his actions, he was going after Yao Changjun and Yang Kai as well, though who knew what he was thinking.

Outside the city, Yang Kai kept using spatial power, moving more than ten li in an instant. Liu Qianyun was held in his arms, still dazed and unable to recover, completely stunned.

Yang Kai had actually injured Yao Changjun, and judging by the situation, it seemed he had done so with Divine Sense. How could that be? Everything she had seen today completely overturned her understanding, making her wonder if she was dreaming.

"Where is that Jixu Ridge?" Yang Kai hurriedly asked, feeling the murderous intent drawing ever closer.

Though he was skilled in spatial force, escaping with Liu Qianyun took a great deal of effort with each teleport. At this rate, Yao Changjun would catch up sooner or later, and with his strength, Yang Kai would have no way to resist.

The only option was to head for Jixu Ridge and hope to use the terrain to shake off Yao Changjun. Earlier, he’d heard Liu Qianyun say the depths of Jixu Ridge were extremely dangerous—even Emperor Realm cultivators might not make it out alive.

"That way!" Liu Qianyun replied instinctively, pointing in a direction. She had lived in Gao City for several years and was very familiar with the surroundings.

Yang Kai immediately changed direction and sped toward Jixu Ridge.

"Senior Brother..." Though Liu Qianyun was held in Yang Kai’s arms, she still felt icy cold, the murderous intent behind them growing ever closer. "You should run by yourself. I’ve dragged you into this."

"I’ve already hurt him once. Do you think he’ll let me go?" Yang Kai replied calmly. "Since you call me Senior Brother, I can’t just abandon you. Don’t worry—escaping is my specialty."

Seeing his resolve, Liu Qianyun could only purse her red lips, her heart full of emotion. Thinking back, she and Yang Kai had only met by fighting at first, and hadn’t spent much time together in Biyu Sect. But after escaping Biyu Sect, Yang Kai had given her half the things in his ring, and now, seeing him stand up for her again in this unfamiliar Star Realm, she felt a deep warmth.

Even back in the Great Wilderness Star Domain, no one had ever treated her so well. In all her years, this was the first time someone had cared for her like this. Pressed close together, Liu Qianyun gradually felt the chilling murderous intent behind them grow less cold, and instead, as time passed, a faint heat began to rise in her body.

Flustered, she quickly shifted her attention and asked, "Senior Brother, is that Yao Changjun really a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm?"

"Without a doubt!"

"Then how did you manage to injure him?" Liu Qianyun asked, puzzled. With such a huge gap in cultivation, no matter what Yang Kai did, he shouldn’t have been able to hurt Yao Changjun. But the pain in Yao Changjun’s howls was clearly real.

"Because his Sea of Consciousness has cracks!" Yang Kai said. "He’s definitely suffered a severe injury. Otherwise, with my current cultivation, if I recklessly attacked him with a Divine Soul secret technique, I’d be the one to suffer backlash—if not dead, then crippled."

"How did you know?" Liu Qianyun was amazed. After all, it was unbelievable. Yang Kai and Yao Changjun hadn’t known each other before—how could he know Yao Changjun’s secret? Cracks in the Sea of Consciousness were his greatest secret. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have hidden his identity in Gao City. Clearly, he was afraid his enemies would find him.

Yang Kai smiled slightly. "He cares so much about the Divine Butian Lotus because he wants to repair his Sea of Consciousness."

Liu Qianyun suddenly understood. "So that spiritual medicine is called the Divine Butian Lotus? Senior Brother, you mean this spiritual medicine can repair the Sea of Consciousness?"

"A single Divine Butian Lotus alone can’t do that," Yang Kai explained after a moment’s thought. "The one you found, if used for alchemy, can be refined into a Butian Pill, which can repair shattered meridians and dantian, and is extremely useful for those who’ve suffered serious injuries. But the Divine Butian Lotus also has another name: the Twin Butian Lotus. When it appears, it’s always a pair—one white, one black. If you can get both, you can refine Twin Butian Pills, which are a level above Butian Pills. They not only repair meridians and dantian, but also restore the Divine Soul, expand the Sea of Consciousness, and, with the union of yin and yang, even help one comprehend the Dao Origin Laws."
