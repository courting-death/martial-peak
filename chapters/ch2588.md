## Chapter 2588 — Suffered Miserably

If it had been before, she probably wouldn’t have dared to rush over so recklessly, even if she wanted to. But now things were different. With the Imperial Treasure, the Myriad Beasts Seal, in hand, sealing over a million Demonic Beast Spirit Essences—among them many Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beasts—she believed that with its power, she could definitely be of some help.

Even if it was a negligible amount of strength, as long as she could contribute, it would have some effect.

She had just taken off when she suddenly felt her ankle tighten, and someone yanked her back.

Landing back on the tree trunk, Ruoxi said angrily, “Senior, what are you doing?”

The one who had pulled her back was none other than the Third Disciple from the Ice Heart Valley who was with her. If not for being with the Third Disciple, relying on her strength and concealment skills, Zhang Ruoxi wouldn’t have been able to get this close.

After all, she was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Now, near the Blood Gate, there were countless Second Stage Emperor Realm yao. Only the Third Disciple, with her miraculous concealment technique, could bring Zhang Ruoxi here without anyone noticing.

Seeing Zhang Ruoxi angry, the Third Disciple looked terrified, but still kept waving her hands, pointing toward the battlefield, then drew a line across her neck and let her tongue loll out grotesquely.

Ruoxi said in a low voice, “I know it’s dangerous over there, and my life might be at risk… but Sir is over there, and I must go help.”

The Third Disciple gripped Zhang Ruoxi’s hand, shaking her head like a rattle drum, looking as if she’d never let go even if she died.

Ruoxi sighed, gently patting the back of the Third Disciple’s hand, and said softly, “Sir raised and taught me. After so many years, I have no way to repay him. Now that I finally have some strength to help, I can’t just stand by. Senior, let me go. Even if it means death, I will never regret it!”

Who knew if the Third Disciple understood, but she just held her hand tightly, refusing to let go no matter what.

“Senior, if you keep this up, I’ll hate you,” Ruoxi said anxiously.

The Third Disciple grinned at her, giving a silly smile. Her white teeth were as clean as jade, forming a stark contrast with her dirty face.

……

At the Blood Gate, the Elder had been waiting solemnly, his hand on his cane fidgeting uneasily.

Although the Eight Saint Envoys had agreed to cooperate after just a few words from him, which surprised him, besides the Eight Saint Envoys, there were still the Thirty-Two Yao Kings. The strength of those Thirty-Two Yao Kings was not much less than the Eight Saint Envoys.

If the Thirty-Two Yao Kings charged over, the Stone Spirit Race alone probably couldn’t resist. At that point, all the Stone Spirits could do was form a circle around Yang Kai and protect him for as long as possible. If that didn’t work, they’d have to find a way to help Yang Kai escape.

But something even more unexpected happened.

The Thirty-Two Yao Kings charged over aggressively, but after a shout from the burly Saint Envoy, they all stood at a distance to watch, showing no intention of joining the fight.

It seemed… the temptation of the Blood Gate was truly immense.

The Elder knew the reason the Thirty-Two Yao Kings were standing by wasn’t because the burly Saint Envoy had such authority, nor because their own side was strong enough, but because the Yao Kings were also deeply interested in the Blood Gate. They hoped his group could break the seal and open the Blood Gate, so they could reap the benefits without effort.

His mood relaxed a bit, but soon the Elder grew worried again.

In this situation, if Yang Kai could tear open the space barrier and break the Blood Gate’s seal, that would be fine. Then all the yao would rush in together, flooding into the Blood Gate.

But if he failed…

Not to mention the Eight Saint Envoys would show no mercy in their disappointment, even the Thirty-Two Yao Kings wouldn’t let them go. Nearly forty Third Stage Emperor Realm experts attacking at once—the Stone Spirit Race would have no chance to fight back!

The more he thought about it, the heavier the Elder’s expression and mood became.

“Elder!”

At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly called out in a low voice.

“Here!” The Elder quickly responded, turning to look. He saw the space at the Blood Gate twisting, but there was no sign of the seal breaking.

“Are you sure that the drawings you showed me before was truly a revelation left behind by the previous Wood Spirit Race Chief, divined at the cost of her life?” Yang Kai’s hands never stopped moving, but his face was as dark as the bottom of a pot.

“I’m sure! Why?” The Elder felt a little guilty, but answered with great certainty, looking as if he’d never lie.

“That revelation was meant for me?” Yang Kai pressed.

A bad feeling welled up in the Elder’s heart, but he forced himself to say, “That’s right!”

“What a load of crap!” Yang Kai snapped. “This damn seal—I can’t open it at all.”

“Huh? How could that be!” The Elder’s heart skipped a beat. Not daring to let Yang Kai give up, he quickly tried to persuade him: “The Blood Gate’s seal is extraordinary. It can’t be broken so easily. Please try a few more times, there’s no rush.”

“It’s not about rushing.” Yang Kai sighed, withdrawing his powers. The twisted space calmed down. He turned to the Elder and said, “I’m simply powerless. I can’t even sense the space barrier, so how could I break the seal? If we keep going, it’s just pointless. Elder, I think we should retreat, while they’re still willing to talk. If we wait any longer, the Four Great Saint Venerables might return.”

The Elder exclaimed, “Weren’t those four lured away by your clever plan?”

Yang Kai shot him a look. “They’re not fools. They’ll notice something’s wrong. Once they do, they’ll come back immediately. Three thousand li is nothing to them. If we don’t leave now, we won’t be able to when they return.”

The Elder fell silent. He knew Yang Kai was right, but after coming this far, it was hard to give up.

He straightened his expression and said, “Please step back, let me and Shi Jiu try.”

Yang Kai could see the Elder was unwilling to give up, so he didn’t try to stop him. Still, he couldn’t help but grumble bitterly, “That former Wood Spirit Chief really led us into a disaster this time.”

If he hadn’t seen those nine ancient drawings in the treehouse, Yang Kai wouldn’t have agreed so easily to the Stone Spirit Race’s request. He really thought he was the savior of the two races, but after trying, he found himself completely powerless.

He couldn’t understand why the previous Wood Spirit Race chief left those nine patterns before dying. The person in the patterns was clearly him, so why couldn’t he open the Blood Gate?

While he was full of unwillingness, the Elder and Xiaoxiao both roared in anger.

Xiaoxiao, already three zhang tall, suddenly swelled up, transforming into a five zhang tall Stone Giant.

The Elder, who had always seemed so ancient and frail, suddenly appeared reborn. His once-bent back straightened with a series of cracking sounds, and in the blink of an eye, he transformed into a Stone Giant even taller than Xiaoxiao. The layers of stone covering his body now looked like bulging muscles, each one brimming with explosive power.

The two exchanged a glance. Xiaoxiao raised the Heaven-Shaking Pillar high and smashed it down with all his might.

Boom…

A thunderous crash rang out. The force was enough to destroy heaven and earth, making the Blood Gate tremble slightly, but it quickly stabilized again.

Xiaoxiao withdrew the Heaven-Shaking Pillar, and the Elder’s fist came crashing down.

That massive fist also struck the Blood Gate, making it shake and ring, but it remained as solid as ever.

Boom, boom, boom…

Thunderous booms rang out one after another, deafening to the ears. Xiaoxiao and the Elder joined forces, striking blow after blow, hurling themselves at the Blood Gate without regard for their lives. The savage strength of the Stone Spirit Race was displayed to its fullest in that moment—even if a towering mountain stood before them, they could have flattened it with a single blow. Yet the Blood Gate showed not the slightest sign of shattering.

“That human can’t break the seal. Are they trying to force it open with brute strength now?” Hu Li watched the scene, knowing exactly what the Stone Spirit Race intended.

“But it doesn’t look like it’s working,” another Yao King said, frowning.

“The Stone Spirit Race is born with incredible strength. They’re the strongest in the world—even the Divine Spirits can’t compare. If even they can’t break it, then this Blood Gate…”

The yao all felt their hopes sink, realizing that breaking the seal was nearly impossible.

Earlier, while watching the commotion, the yao had been somewhat hopeful, looking forward to the moment the Blood Gate’s seal would be broken. But now, that hope was turning into deep disappointment.

They were only disappointed, but the Eight Saint Envoys were more than that—they were angry.

They’d been playing along with the Stone Spirit Race, turning a blind eye and letting them do as they pleased at the Blood Gate.

Who would have thought these guys would accomplish nothing, making them wait in vain for so long.

If the Saint Venerables found out, they’d definitely be in trouble.

And with all this commotion, it wouldn’t be long before the Saint Venerables noticed and came to investigate.

Boom…

Another loud crash rang out. The Heaven-Shaking Pillar in Xiaoxiao’s hands shattered into pieces.

That Heaven-Shaking Pillar was something Yang Kai had obtained in the Dark Star’s Imperial Garden years ago. Xiaoxiao had used it as a weapon ever since, but now it had finally reached the end of its life.

As the Heaven-Shaking Pillar broke, Xiaoxiao was clearly stunned.

Right after, the Elder’s punch also failed, and a look of despair gradually appeared in his eyes.

“Elder, it’s time to leave.” Yang Kai, watching the Eight Saint Envoys’ faces grow darker, realized their patience was running out and couldn’t help but urge him.

The Elder didn’t answer, still trading blows with Xiaoxiao against the Blood Gate, making the earth shake with each strike.

“Elder!” Yang Kai shouted, “As long as the green hills remain, there will always be firewood. If we don’t leave now, the Stone Spirit Race will be buried here!”

The words woke him up. The Elder stopped, his face heavy, and shouted unwillingly, “Go!”

“You think you can just leave after coming here? There’s no such easy thing in this world!” The burly Saint Envoy’s voice was icy. With no more hesitation, he struck the Stone Spirit in the chest with a punch, his Yao Yuan surging.

The Stone Spirit was caught off guard and was sent flying dozens of zhang, tumbling through the air.

The burly Saint Envoy was furious, feeling he’d been played for a fool, and naturally wasn’t willing to let the Stone Spirit Race leave so easily.
