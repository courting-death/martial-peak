## Chapter 2198 — Only One Left

Luo Yuan spoke again, "To keep you from causing me any more trouble, this Spiritual Pill... you’d better take it now!"

As he spoke, his figure flickered and he appeared right in front of the round-faced woman. He pinched her chin with one hand, took out the Supreme Mystic Pill with the other, and tossed it into her mouth.

"Cough, cough, cough..." The round-faced woman, after swallowing the Spiritual Pill, couldn’t help but stagger back a few steps, coughing lightly and pounding her chest, as if trying to spit the pill out.

But it was already too late. As soon as the Spiritual Pill entered her mouth, it instantly dissolved into a sweet liquid and flowed into her belly.

She struggled for quite a while but failed, and could only look up in despair.

In front of her, Luo Yuan was nowhere to be seen.

"He’s already gone." Lan Xun looked at the round-faced woman and sighed softly, "He went toward the exit."

Hearing this, the round-faced woman turned to look and indeed saw a streak of light rushing rapidly toward the exit.

Luo Yuan didn’t even bother to make a deal with Yang Kai, as if to prove what he’d said before—that with his aptitude, even without the Supreme Mystic Pill, he was more than capable of advancing to the Emperor Realm!

"Senior Brother Luo!" the round-faced woman called out, gritted her teeth, stomped her foot, and hurried after Luo Yuan.

At this point, no one stepped forward to trouble her anymore. For one thing, she was still a disciple of the Eight Directions Sect and Luo Yuan’s Junior Sister—after all, the one who had died so miserably at Luo Yuan’s hands earlier was an outsider. For another... the Supreme Mystic Pill had already been consumed, so what was the point of making things difficult for her now? Did they expect her to cough up the Spiritual Pill she’d just swallowed?

And so, this little episode came to an end.

"Was it really as he said, not wanting to be bound by favors... or was he unwilling to snatch someone else’s opportunity?" Yang Kai sat in place, stroking his chin thoughtfully...

With so many people present, perhaps everyone only saw Luo Yuan’s ruthlessness and cruelty, but Yang Kai saw something else.

Earlier, he had been negotiating with the round-faced woman. Before the deal was struck, Luo Yuan had shouted at him from afar, telling him to know when to stop!

At the time, Yang Kai hadn’t understood why Luo Yuan did that, but thinking back now, it was clearly out of solidarity as fellow disciples, helping the round-faced woman.

If Luo Yuan were truly so heartless and unfeeling, he wouldn’t have said that at all. He could have just watched coldly as the round-faced woman made a deal with Yang Kai...

For someone as powerful and proud as Luo Yuan, how could he accept a gift from someone else? Especially when that person was his own Junior Sister, a Junior Sister who admired and adored him...

Yang Kai thought that if he were in Luo Yuan’s position, he absolutely couldn’t accept that Supreme Mystic Pill either.

That’s what a real man should be like.

Setting aside Luo Yuan’s poor treatment of his Junior Sister, Yang Kai actually admired his decisiveness.

After thinking it over for a while, Yang Kai shook his head, a wry smile crossing his face. Why am I worrying about other people’s business?

With that, he called out loudly, "Next!"

Perhaps because the round-faced woman had managed to make a deal earlier, the remaining cultivators saw hope. As soon as Yang Kai spoke, they all surged forward, each wanting to be the first to reach him.

But under the influence of the Spatial Law, only one person could succeed.

Unfortunately, the result left that person utterly disappointed. After Yang Kai checked the items he brought out, he simply waved his hand and told him to get lost.

The next dozen or so people met the same fate!

Amidst the busyness, Yang Kai took a moment to glance around and found that there weren’t many people left.

This made him secretly anxious. The Calamity Fruit he wanted still hadn’t appeared. He didn’t know if someone else had a use for it and hadn’t brought it out, or if the person who took it hadn’t come here at all.

If, on this trip to the Four Seasons Land, he couldn’t obtain the Calamity Fruit, he really didn’t know how to explain it to Qin Chaoyang. Qin Yu was waiting for the Calamity Fruit to save her life. Without this spirit fruit, the little girl would only live a few more months at most.

Should he just directly propose to exchange the Calamity Fruit for a Supreme Mystic Pill?

Yang Kai hesitated. If he made such a request and the person who had the Calamity Fruit was here, they probably wouldn’t refuse. But if no one had it and the news got out, it would be bad for him. Someone would surely make a fuss and target him.

After thinking it over, Yang Kai suppressed the idea and continued trading as if nothing was wrong.

An hour later, Yang Kai’s face had grown gloomy.

All the cultivators who had already come had traded with him, yet he still hadn’t seen any sign of the Calamity Fruit.

His ominous premonition had come true!

The only ones left who hadn’t traded with him were a few people from Qingyang Shrine and several renowned experts who had been watching from the sidelines, never competing with the others.

At this point, Yang Kai no longer wished to waste time. He raised his voice and called out, “Which of you will go first? I won’t hide anymore—there were only four Supreme Mystic Pills refined in total. In other words… there’s just one left in my hands now.”

He had taken one himself, given one to Lan Xun, and traded one to the round-faced woman. If only four pills were refined, then there was indeed only one left.

As he spoke, Yang Kai picked up his Ink Jade Cauldron and gave it a gentle shake.

Instantly, a crisp clinking sound came from the Ink Jade Cauldron.

Judging by the sound, there was indeed only one pill inside!

After the pills were refined, all of Yang Kai’s actions had been under everyone’s watchful eyes. He had no chance or time to stash any pills away, so everyone trusted what he said.

"Since there’s only one left, I won’t stand on ceremony," Xiao Chen, who had been holding back for a long time, finally got his turn. He leapt out eagerly, striding toward Yang Kai with a confident smile, as if he was determined to get that last Spiritual Pill.

Soon, he arrived in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled at him and said, "Please, Brother Xiao."

Xiao Chen sneered, taking out some items from his Spatial Ring while lowering his voice, "Kid, I advise you to quit while you’re ahead. Just take whatever you want and hand the Supreme Mystic Pill over to me, and everyone will be happy."

Yang Kai looked up at him upon hearing this.

With a fake smile, Xiao Chen continued, "The things I’ve brought out aren’t something just anyone can see. I’m sure there’s something you want."

He had the right to say this. After all, not only was he from the Star God Palace, the dominant sect of the Southern Territory, he was also an elite disciple and the son of Star Envoy Xiao Yuyang. How could he not have good things on hand?

The items he brought out were indeed rare treasures! Whether secret treasures or miraculous Spiritual Pills, all were precious, and there were even secret manuals...

A dazzling array, too many to count.

Yet Yang Kai didn’t even glance at them. He just looked at Xiao Chen and asked, "Brother Xiao, during this trip to the Four Seasons Land, did you go to the Winter Domain?"

Xiao Chen was baffled, not knowing why Yang Kai would ask this, and replied impatiently, "No, I’ve always been by Her Highness the Princess’s side. The Princess said the environment in the Winter Domain was harsh..."

"If not, then you can pack up and leave!" Yang Kai cut him off, waving his hand.

"What did you say?" Xiao Chen’s face instantly darkened, glaring at Yang Kai with a menacing look.

"Didn’t hear me?" Yang Kai grinned, stretched his neck toward Xiao Chen, and shouted, "Brother Xiao, you can get lost!"

After saying that, he pulled back and smiled, "If you still can’t hear me, then there’s nothing I can do."

Xiao Chen’s expression changed dramatically, his face alternating between red and white. He growled, "Kid, you’d better think this through!"

In front of everyone, being yelled at by Yang Kai was a huge loss of face. More importantly, everyone now knew he didn’t have what Yang Kai wanted. If he kept pestering, everyone would see he was just bullying with his status...

But Yang Kai didn’t give him any face at all.

"Get lost!" Yang Kai said bluntly, curling his lip. With a surge of Spatial Law, he pressed toward Xiao Chen, trying to force him out of this shattered world.

It must be said, Xiao Chen truly lived up to his reputation. Earlier, Yang Kai had used this very move to directly send a Dao Source Realm cultivator out of this shattered world, but when it came to Xiao Chen, things were far from simple. An inexplicable Law Power lingered around Xiao Chen, clashing and collapsing against the Spatial Law, causing his figure to flicker in and out of sight, shifting unpredictably.

This situation lasted for a full ten breaths before Xiao Chen had to withdraw on his own.

If he stayed any longer, he’d really have to fight Yang Kai. In that strange world, Xiao Chen also sensed a deadly threat and didn’t dare remain.

Thirty zhang away, Xiao Chen glared at Yang Kai with a sinister look, gnashing his teeth.

Lan Xun felt thoroughly embarrassed. She sighed and headed for the exit.

Seeing this, Xiao Chen’s expression changed. He turned and shouted angrily at Yang Kai, "Kid, I’ll remember you. You’d better pray you don’t fall into my hands."

With that threat, he chased after Lan Xun.

Yang Kai ignored him, instead smiling at Xia Sheng and the others. "Brother Xia, there really is only one Spiritual Pill left. Don’t you want to take a look?"

If possible, he actually wanted to trade the Spiritual Pill to Xia Sheng.

After all, he would never be able to take it out with him. If he tried, those Emperor Realm masters would just rob him and toss him some random compensation.

As for giving it away for nothing...

Yang Kai had never considered it. For one, he and Xia Sheng weren’t that close, and for another, the Supreme Mystic Pill was so precious that even if he offered it, Xia Sheng wouldn’t dare accept it.

If he really took the Supreme Mystic Pill, he’d owe a huge favor.
