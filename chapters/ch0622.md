## Chapter 622 — The First Pill Refining

After a long while, he finally began his second attempt.

Because of the earlier failure, the spirit formation within the pill furnace had been burned away, so this time he had to start from scratch.

He meticulously engraved the required spirit formation inside the furnace using his True Yuan.

But this attempt fared even worse than the last; a single lapse caused a slight deviation in his True Yuan while engraving the spirit formation, and the instant the pattern took shape the formation suddenly shattered.

Within the furnace, chaotic bursts of energy rippled forth, like untamed steeds impossible to rein in.

Yang Kai felt a throbbing headache and finally understood: knowing the theory of pill refinement is one thing, actually making pills with one’s hands is another entirely.

In that light, his Senior Sister’s talent truly inspired envy; possessing the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body, she could refine pills at will—any ingredient placed in her hands would obediently fuse to whatever degree she desired.

After three more consecutive failures, the spirit formation at last stabilized inside the furnace.

Engraving a spirit formation required absolute concentration—no slack could be afforded—and the entire pattern had to be completed in one flowing motion; any mistake or discrepancy would cause the formation to collapse.

Such work was highly draining of both energy and True Yuan.

Only by executing it all with perfect precision could the spirit formation take shape and exert its proper effect.

It sounded simple enough, but once he tried it himself he discovered how fraught with difficulty it was, a maddening challenge; fortunately Yang Kai’s temperament was steadfast, and he did not become discouraged by one or two failures.

Each failure only added to his experience and brought him closer to success.

With the spirit formation stabilized, Yang Kai once again began depositing ingredients into the furnace in an orderly fashion; his True Yuan flowed over them, quickly melting them into medicinal liquid and blending them together.

Various medicinal effects activated, coalescing into masses and interacting with one another; their conflicts produced subtle changes.

This time he exercised even greater caution, yet still failed.

As he tried to purge the impurities from the ingredients to make the liquid purer, the furnace suddenly erupted with a bang, and the scent of burning filled the air once more.

Sitting cross-legged in the room, Yang Kai silently pondered and slowly gathered his spirit.

After regulating his breath, once his vital energy and spirit had returned to their peak, he started again.

Fail, fail…

The succession of failures would have left anyone feeling helpless, but Yang Kai’s expression remained calm; time and again he emptied the ruined material from the furnace and repeated the same actions he had taken before each failure.

He knew that with every failure he made some progress.

Practice makes perfect—this was no empty saying! To refine a good Pill was not something accomplished in a day. He had only just begun.

Discarded material piled up around the room and the smell of burning lingered, yet Yang Kai never once relaxed his focus.

Time flowed on, and he lost track of how long had passed.

The low-grade materials he had bought for fifty Crystal Stones had already been consumed by about eighty percent, and Yang Kai still had not produced a single finished Pill.

Yet he was like someone possessed by a demonic focus, his expression painstakingly meticulous, utterly absorbed.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai began another attempt, for the umpteenth time.

But this time it felt different—an indistinct sensation of confidence rose within him; a premonition that this attempt would surely succeed.

His engraving of spirit formations had become practiced and familiar; Yang Kai could now stabilize the pattern within the furnace in only ten breaths.

One herb after another was cast into the furnace; under Yang Kai’s True Yuan they melted, pooling into medicinal liquid as his True Yuan traversed the liquid, burning away impurities and dispelling unnecessary components.

The whole process proceeded without error; like a seasoned craftsman, Yang Kai was guiding the Pill toward formation.

Soon a faint, agreeable fragrance began to waft from the furnace.

Yang Kai’s spirit tightened; he dared not be careless, carefully controlling the output and strength of his True Yuan to govern the Pill’s tempering.

After some time, when the medicinal liquids had been refined to their limit, Yang Kai abruptly withdrew all his True Yuan.

The spirit formation within the furnace contracted fiercely like a great net, binding all the liquid together and condensing it into a plump, round Pill.

Ding-dong…

A crisp sound came from the furnace.

Yang Kai was sweating profusely, but could not contain his joy; he quickly took the Pill from the furnace.

Its enticing aroma lingered at his nostrils; the small Pill, barely the size of a thumbnail, had condensed nearly all the medicinal efficacy of the ingredients—every drop of his effort had been poured into that tiny sphere.

Feeling it carefully, Yang Kai discovered that the first Pill he had ever refined in his life was, surprisingly, only of Common-Grade quality.

All the materials he had used were Earth-Grade, for on the Tongxuan Continent Common-Grade ingredients were seldom gathered—treated like wildflowers by the roadside, largely worthless.

Earth-Grade materials had some limited use.

To use Earth-Grade materials and refine a Common-Grade Pill was an unsatisfactory result, but Yang Kai was content, for this was the first Pill he had personally made.

Holding the Pill between his fingers, Yang Kai pondered, recalling the sensations of the refining process.

He thought that if he could condense the medicinal effects a bit more, purge impurities a bit more completely, and control the tempering of the Pill a bit better, the Pill’s quality would surely improve.

And through this success he gained a deep appreciation for the vast profundity of alchemy; he had attained some understanding of its many subtleties and mysteries.

To become a competent alchemist, merely mastering the vast body of knowledge is far from enough; one must undergo countless trials and accumulate experience.

This first success had given him a great deal of precious experience.

After a short rest, he renewed his efforts and continued to strive.

Time passed in the blink of an eye—ten days had gone by.

The materials Yang Kai had bought for fifty Crystal Stones were now entirely spent, not a drop left.

Just as he was about to emerge from seclusion, light footsteps sounded outside; from their cadence Yang Kai discerned who had come.

Smiling faintly, he waved away the barrier encasing the room and opened the door.

Shui Ling stood outside, her expression somewhat complicated.

When the scent issuing from the room reached her, she covered her nose and frowned, saying, “What’s that smell?”

Yang Kai scratched his cheek, embarrassed.

Not far off, Yun Xuan and the burly Great Han and the others had also arrived.

Apparently knowing Yang Kai had been refining Pills in recent days, the burly Great Han came forward and made a few leering faces at Yang Kai. “Brother, how’d it go? Made any good Pills? Share one with us!”

“Ji Hong!” Yun Xuan shot him a sharp look.

Yang Kai had never refined Pills before; he had bought some ingredients on a whim to try his hand. Without instruction, it would be strange if he could actually produce a Pill.

If refining Pills were really so easy, the title of alchemist would not be held in such high esteem.

From the smell of burning and the stacks of discarded material drifting from the room, Yun Xuan already understood the frustrations Yang Kai had endured during the past ten days.

"Heh heh, tell us." The big, bearded man chuckled, though not maliciously.

Yun Xuan looked apologetically at Yang Kai, hesitated, and then said, “If you really want to learn alchemy, I can introduce you to a Pill association in the alliance as an apprentice; find a master within and you’ll learn far more than by groping around alone.”

“No need, I was just playing around,” Yang Kai replied with a smile, shaking his head.

Yun Xuan nodded lightly and said no more; she found the young man interesting—clearly he had some interest in alchemy, yet he refused instruction and preferred to lock himself in a room to experiment alone.

She secretly sighed—at this rate, he’d never be able to refine any decent Pills in his life—but that was not her business; as an outsider she had no right to interfere.

“Yang Kai, someone from the Hall has come to fetch me back,” Shui Ling said.

“Oh? Congratulations, then,” Yang Kai smiled.

“Mm, I’ll come by later to bid you farewell,” Shui Ling said.

The Water Divine Hall’s people had arrived in Duao City two days earlier, but because Yang Kai had been secluded and refining Pills in his room, Shui Ling did not feel she could simply leave.

After all, Yang Kai had brought her back.

Parting soon, Shui Ling showed little sadness; she was full of joy, chatting and laughing with Yang Kai and the others as they walked out.

Outside Yun Xuan’s team residence a lavishly decorated carriage waited; it was drawn by several strange, lofty beasts, and a gusty force swirled about their hooves.

Yang Kai watched and clicked his tongue in admiration.

“Miss!” Beside the carriage stood a Transcendent Realm expert waiting; he called out the moment he saw Shui Ling, his expression cold.

Shui Ling nodded lightly, then turned to Yang Kai. “In any case, I must thank you. Take this water-blue jade pendant; if you ever need it, come to the Water Divine Hall and find me. Also, I will keep an eye out for any news of your several friends’ whereabouts—if I learn anything I will find a way to notify you.”

“Thank you.” Yang Kai reached out to accept the water-blue jade pendant and thanked her sincerely.

The Transcendent Realm expert peered at Yang Kai with some surprise, as if unable to understand why such a youth would be so highly regarded by their young miss, to the point of having even given him the pendant.

Yun Xuan’s beautiful eyes flickered as she regarded Yang Kai with suspicion.

Although Shui Ling had stayed in their mansion for over ten days and they had gotten along well, Yun Xuan still had not worked out what relationship Yang Kai and Shui Ling actually shared.

“That’s all, then. I’m leaving.” Shui Ling pursed her lips in a smile and climbed into the carriage.

The Transcendent Realm expert’s expression remained austere; he did not so much as glance at Yang Kai or the others but strode to the driver’s position. His True Yuan surged forth, wind rising beneath the beasts’ hooves, bright patterns flaring across the carriage as it lifted and sped away like a bolt.

“No wonder she’s the Water Divine Hall’s little princess—this carriage is magnificent.” The burly man and the others watched enviously.

That carriage was clearly a Secret Treasure designed for conveying people—a high-grade item, not easy to refine; only a force like the Water Divine Hall could have one.
