## Chapter 54 — A Thousand Charms and Beauties

After walking for a short while, a voice of surprise and delight came from nearby: “Senior Brother Yang!”

Yang Kai glanced sideways and saw Li Yuntian waving at him with a face full of enthusiasm. In front of Li Yuntian was a stall displaying a miscellany of items—some herbs and a few bottles that appeared to contain pills.

“What are you doing setting up a stall here?” Yang Kai asked as he approached. He recalled that last time, Su Mu had issued a strict order for them all to focus intensely on cultivation.

“I just broke through,” Li Yuntian explained. “Young Master Su told me to come out and relax a bit, to stabilize my realm. Besides, the brothers need some items to aid their cultivation, so I thought I’d try my luck here.”

“I see.” Yang Kai examined Li Yuntian carefully and noticed he indeed seemed stronger than before. He had likely advanced to the eighth stage of the Body Tempering Realm.

“What brings you here, Senior Brother?” Li Yuntian asked curiously.

“I’m here to buy something.”

“What do you need? Take a look—if I have it, you can have it without hesitation,” Li Yuntian said generously, pointing to the items on his stall.

“Seeds of Yang-attribute spirit herbs or miraculous medicines—do you have any?”

Li Yuntian shook his head. “No, I don’t have those. And as far as I know, seeds are rarely sold in this trade market.”

Generally, seeds were not highly valuable but remained rare.

“I’m just trying my luck as well,” Yang Kai chuckled.

“Alright, I’ll put up a sign for you and see if anyone responds. I’ll be here these next few days, so if fortune favors us, someone might sell some,” Li Yuntian proposed.

“That would be great. Thank you, Junior Brother Li.”

Li Yuntian quickly tore a piece of paper and wrote a line of words, setting it upright beside the stall.

After chatting a while longer, Yang Kai learned that Su Mu and the others had suffered a heavy blow recently. With Su Yan’s harsh words hanging over them, the once wayward young master had finally reined himself in. These days, he had been cultivating day and night and had already broken through to the Open Origin Realm.

Parting ways with Li Yuntian, Yang Kai made his way to the stall where he had previously purchased Yang Flame Stones.

Seeing the familiar vendor, Yang Kai exhaled in relief—he had truly feared not finding him again.

“Ah, young sir, you’re back?” The Blood Battle Gang disciple recognized Yang Kai from the last time he was with Hu Mei’er and greeted him with respect.

“What do you want this time?” the vendor asked.

“Do you still have the seed of the Three Yang Fruit you sold me last time?” Yang Kai asked directly.

The vendor shook his head. “No, I only had that one seed, which I gave to you as a gift.”

“I see,” Yang Kai said, a bit disappointed. “Thanks anyway.”

Turning to leave, Yang Kai intended to search the Black Wind Trade Market carefully. With so many vendors, if luck was on his side, he might find what he sought.

The Blood Battle Gang disciple hesitated for a moment, then called out, “Young sir, please wait.”

Yang Kai turned back. “What is it?”

“Actually, there wasn’t only one seed of the Three Yang Fruit. There were several, but I only got one. The others were taken by a few others.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes brightened. “Where are the others?”

“They’re in our gang’s mining area, extracting Yang Flame Stones and other minerals. But even our own gang members are not allowed to enter easily, let alone an outsider like you.”

“When will they come out?” Yang Kai pressed, unwilling to give up.

“Not anytime soon. If you want to find them, you might have to wait one or two months.”

Yang Kai frowned. Such a long wait was unbearable.

“Do you have any way to get me in to find them? Don’t worry, I only want to buy the seeds.”

“I have no way. I’m just an ordinary member of the gang,” the vendor said with a bitter smile. Then his eyes flickered and he added, “But someone else might be able to help.”

Yang Kai’s expression changed. “Please, tell me.”

The vendor smiled slyly, his tone somewhat ambiguous. “You can ask the young lady for help. With her leading you, the people in the mining area won’t stop you.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s face twisted awkwardly. He stammered, “My relationship with your young lady is... just so-so.”

“Uh-huh,” the vendor nodded repeatedly, clearly not believing him. He pointed to a wooden house not far away. “It’s a coincidence—she’s just come to the trade market today and is resting inside that house. If you’re eager for the seeds, why not ask her?”

Yang Kai hesitated. The incident with Hu Mei’er that day had left things unpleasant; he had thoroughly offended her. Now he had to swallow his pride and seek her help. How could he bear it?

But without her, there was no other good option.

Still unwilling to give up, Yang Kai searched the Black Wind Trade Market thoroughly. Though he found some seeds, none were Yang-attribute, so they were worthless to him.

With no choice left, Yang Kai gritted his teeth. Fine, he would lose face if he must. After all, he had done nothing to deserve her enmity—what was there to fear?

These wooden houses were mostly guarded by disciples from the three sects, places where masters cultivated. Hu Mei’er, as the youngest daughter of the Blood Battle Gang’s leader, was not very powerful but held a respectable status. It was normal for her to rest inside.

No one dared to approach within thirty zhang of these houses, and all martial artists respected the masters inside. Naturally, no stalls were set up nearby.

Arriving at the wooden house the vendor had indicated, Yang Kai stood at the door, unsure how to begin. Suddenly, a sharp voice came from inside: “Who’s outside?”

The voice sounded somewhat like Hu Mei’er’s, yet strange.

Having come this far, Yang Kai would not turn back. He said, “Miss Mei’er, I am Yang Kai. I hope you will come out to see me.”

Contrary to Yang Kai’s expectation, two women sat inside. Their appearances were nearly identical, even their expressions and postures were indistinguishable. At first glance, one might think there was a mirror inside, and one was the reflection of the other.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s voice, one of them’s beautiful eyes flickered with surprise and astonishment. She turned to the other and said, “Little sister, is this the Yang Kai you mentioned?”

The woman addressed was Hu Mei’er, who nodded. “Yes. Why would he come looking for me?”

She had thought that after their last parting, there would be no further connection between them.

The other woman sneered, “It seems he is not the kind of man who regards beauty with indifference. Some men feign loftiness only to lure innocent girls like you, then seize your body and soul, damning you forever.”

Hu Mei’er’s face flushed with anger. “Sister, he’s not what you think.”

Hu Jiao’er laughed softly. “If he’s not, why come looking for you after all these days? He must know you still think of him and has come to make his move.”

Hu Mei’er scolded, “Sister, you always assume the worst.”

If he truly were that kind of man, Hu Mei’er believed she would have lost her purity that day by the lake. No man could resist such temptation.
