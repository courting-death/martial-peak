## Chapter 2012 — Power of the Laws

One day later, Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi opened their eyes in turn, each radiant with divine light — clearly fully recovered.

Mo Xiaoqi, while recalling several of her demonic beasts, asked Yang Kai, "Eldest Brother Yang, since we've reached the third layer, we can't let the benefits here go to waste — do we act together or split up?"

Yang Kai considered for a moment and replied, "What do you think?"

Mo Xiaoqi chuckled, "If you want to be safer, I think acting together is better. But if you want more benefits, we should split up. Eldest Brother Yang, you don't know — the real benefits inside the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda are not the heaven-and-earth treasures born here, nor those secret treasures left behind; the true gains are the fragmented Power of the Laws and Stellar Origins drifting through the world!"

"I've heard that, but never seen it — how does it work?" Yang Kai frowned.

Mo Xiaoqi smiled, "The first and second layers don't have much of those things, but the third layer is different. Right now it's just the two of us, with no one to compete. If we can obtain some of that fragmented Power of the Laws and Stellar Origins, it will greatly aid our advancement to the Dao Origin Realm."

Yang Kai nodded and smiled, "So you intend to split up?"

Mo Xiaoqi stuck out her tongue sheepishly. "After all, if two people are together, even if we find benefits we'd have to split them… I'm not unwilling to share with you, Eldest Brother Yang, it's just…"

"I understand. If you have confidence in yourself, then split up." Yang Kai smiled.

"Then Eldest Brother Yang, you must be careful — there are Dao Origin Realm demonic beasts on the third layer."

"You too." Yang Kai nodded.

Yang Kai wasn't overly worried about Mo Xiaoqi. With her methods and the Secret Treasures she carried, even if she encountered a Dao Origin Realm demonic beast — at most an Eleventh-Tier one — she'd be fine; and if she couldn't win, she could still defend herself.

He wasn't particularly anxious for himself either. If things went badly he could release the Yao Worm Matriarch. As long as he didn't run into a large pack of Eleventh-Tier demonic beasts swarming him, Yang Kai was confident he could remain safe on the third layer. He could even take the chance to temper his Blood Beast.

The Blood Beast army he had formed back in his Star Domain homeland was now of little use here in the Star Realm; it was time for an update.

After agreeing, they quickly searched in different directions and separated.

With the two of them going their separate ways, it was nearly certain they wouldn’t meet again before the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda closed. In this manner, each would have ample room to seek out the opportunities meant for them.

One day later, Yang Kai stood on a flat stretch of ground and, opening and closing his hands, sent a series of Moon Blades flying forward.

Not far off, the snow‑white Yao Worm Matriarch drew both swords, which emitted a purple‑green light. It unleashed the Purple‑Green Twin Swords — a Void King‑Grade, upper‑level Secret Treasure — to their fullest.

An icy profound intent radiated from the Yao Worm Matriarch, its icy Power of the Laws turning the earth within a hundred zhang into frozen soil.

As for the Yao Worm Matriarch’s opponent, it was an Eleventh-Tier Azure Flame Thunder Jackal—a Demonic Beast with the form of something between a wolf and a jackal. Its body was small, its movements extremely agile, and it was born wielding both fire and lightning. It was an exceedingly troublesome creature to face.

The Yao Worm Matriarch could now exert power comparable to the lower bounds of the Dao Origin Realm; even after contending with the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal for most of a day, it still couldn't slay it, showing how formidable its opponent was.

Yang Kai did not rush in; he stood at a distance, using spatial secret arts to continuously disrupt the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal's movements.

As time passed, more wounds appeared on the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal, and with the Yao Worm Matriarch's icy profound intent seeping in, its movements grew increasingly sluggish.

This was the terror of the icy profound intent — it could silently weaken an enemy's perception and speed, causing them to slow without noticing and eventually die.

Two hours later, accompanied by a shrill, tragic howl, the Yao Worm Matriarch's Purple‑Green Twin Swords finally pierced the enemy's vital spot, bringing out torrents of crimson blood; the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal's death struggle forced the Yao Worm Matriarch to retreat step by step.

But it was futile.

A moment later, the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal's eyes went blank; it collapsed and did not move again.

Only then did Yang Kai step forward.

The Yao Worm Matriarch opened its mouth, swallowed the Purple‑Green Twin Swords, then crawled over to rub itself affectionately against Yang Kai's feet.

Ordinary Blood Beasts would never behave like that, but the Yao Worm Matriarch possessed a kind of chaotic intelligence, so its affectionate behavior was explainable.

Squatting before the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal's corpse, Yang Kai decided to temper it into a Blood Beast. He forced a strand of Golden Blood Threads from his fingers, stabbed them into the body, sat cross‑legged, formed spiritual seals, and began the Blood Beast tempering method.

Half a day later, the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal swayed and stood, its eyes dim and devoid of spirit, its body emitting a faint blood‑qi glow.

This was the hallmark of a Blood Beast.

Yang Kai sensed and confirmed that the new Blood Beast's strength had not fallen to the Void King Realm; it still retained Dao Origin Realm strength, which pleased him.

With the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal as two Blood Beasts guarding him, most of the third layer was now safe for him to traverse.

Yang Kai took the two Blood Beasts and continued exploring.

…

Two days later, Yang Kai sat cross‑legged somewhere on the third layer, a trace of joy on his face as he silently circulated his profound arts.

From the sky above, visible streaks of light shot toward him like swallows returning to the nest, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Contained within those streaks was the fragmented Power of the Laws from this ancient battlefield.

This was the greatest advantage inside the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda that Mo Xiaoqi had mentioned.

Yang Kai had happened upon this place and, without hesitation, began to absorb them.

He absorbed those streaks of light into his body and could clearly discern the mysteries of the laws, laying a solid foundation for future advancement to the Dao Origin Realm.

But soon he noticed something odd.

After the streaks entered his body, the fragmented Power of the Laws they carried was so vast he couldn't absorb it all in time; yet they didn't disappear — instead, they flowed toward the Xuan Realm Pearl and vanished.

Information from his Incarnation told Yang Kai that the vanished Power of the Laws had surged into the Small Xuan Realm.

The Small Xuan Realm underwent a tremendous change.

With the infusion of the Power of the Laws, the space inside the Small Xuan Realm grew increasingly vast and grand, gradually taking on the outline of a true world. Inside, some inexplicable transformations also began to occur.

Yang Kai didn't fully understand why this was happening.

But after some thought he conceived a possibility.

The Xuan Realm Pearl was an Imperial Treasure — an expert‑level Secret Treasure refined by an Emperor Realm cultivator that condensed a vast space within. Its internal laws were imperfect, so although it could accommodate people and allow cultivation, it couldn't function like a true world.

Now, the Power of the Laws surging in from the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda was helping the Small Xuan Realm perfect its laws.

Once the laws inside the Xuan Realm Pearl were perfected, the Small Xuan Realm would truly become a world.

Yang Kai couldn't immediately verify this hypothesis, but it seemed likely.

So he didn't panic; he let it be. After all, this was residual Power of the Laws from the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda; the more he absorbed, the better.

The absorption took most of the day. When no more streaks of light fell, Yang Kai opened his eyes with a trace of regret.

Meditating on it, he found that his understanding of the Power of the Laws had indeed improved; he vaguely grasped some of the wonders of the Dao Origin Realm, though it was far from enough. Moreover, the Small Xuan Realm still seemed capable of absorbing more Power of the Laws and becoming more complete.

Rising to his feet, Yang Kai continued searching.

What Yang Kai did not know was that a cultivation spot like the one he had just used should have been enough for a dozen or so Void King Realm practitioners to advance to the Dao Origin Realm, but because the Xuan Realm Pearl absorbed most of the laws, it not only shortened his own comprehension time but also caused that cultivation spot to become ordinary and lose any miraculous properties for the next hundred years.

If the Star God Palace knew of this, they certainly would not let him off lightly.

From one perspective, such cultivation spots were part of the Star God Palace's foundation; damaging a sect's foundation was not a trivial matter.

In the following days, Yang Kai continued to search for similar spots, but such places proved truly rare and he did not find any.

During those days he also suffered some attacks from demonic beasts, but with the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal guarding him, those beasts had no chance against Yang Kai.

They either died miserably under the Blood Beasts' assault or fled when things went poorly.

Yang Kai did not temper more Blood Beasts; instead he processed the corpses of slain demonic beasts, extracting their Inner Cores and all valuable parts to save for future use or sale.

His experience in his Star Domain homeland had taught him that Blood Beasts did not need to be numerous — too many were hard to control and consumed vast Divine Sense power; tempering Blood Beasts also consumed his Golden Blood Threads and sacrificed the corpse's materials, which often wasn't worthwhile.

Several days of fruitless searching soured Yang Kai's mood somewhat.

He did not know when the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda would close, but it had already remained open for quite some time. It likely wouldn’t last much longer. Opportunities like this would not come a second time, so he grew impatient to seek out more drifting lights.
