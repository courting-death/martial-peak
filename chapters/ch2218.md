## Chapter 2218 — Spirit Fruit

In the jungles of the Heavenly Yao Mountain Range, a man and a beast raced swiftly through the undergrowth.

The Purple Civet led the way, with Yang Kai following close behind.

After a brief period of contact, once it was sure Yang Kai meant it no harm, the Purple Civet no longer seemed afraid of him. It didn’t even try to escape, and as it led the way, it would occasionally stop to wait for Yang Kai to catch up before setting off again.

The Purple Civet’s actions were clearly purposeful. Along the way, they didn’t encounter any other demonic beasts, though it was unclear what ability it used to evade them.

After an hour, the man and beast arrived at a mountain valley.

The valley was surrounded by mountains on all sides. Without knowing the terrain, it would be nearly impossible to find.

The Purple Civet stopped abruptly a short distance from the valley entrance, refusing to go further. When Yang Kai approached, it gestured into the valley with its little paw, then used both paws to clutch its own neck, miming difficulty breathing, eyes rolling back, and finally collapsed stiffly to the ground.

“Hm?” Yang Kai frowned as he watched, then said, “You mean there’s danger in the valley...?”

The Purple Civet rolled over, stood up again, and nodded at Yang Kai.

“Let me take a look!” Yang Kai said, poking his head to peer into the valley. With just one glance, he immediately understood what the Purple Civet meant by danger.

The valley was filled with thick, emerald-green poisonous mist. Its color and form were exactly like the venom the giant python had spat out earlier, except this time it covered a much larger area. The poisonous mist shrouded everything in the valley, making it impossible to see what lay within.

“I’m rather curious...” Yang Kai glanced at the Purple Civet with a smile. “How did you manage to steal a spirit fruit from here earlier...?”

With only Ninth-Tier strength, the Purple Civet couldn’t possibly enter such a mist-shrouded valley, let alone steal a spirit fruit.

Yet, it was precisely because the Purple Civet had stolen a spirit fruit that the giant python had chased it so relentlessly, all the way to Yang Kai.

When Yang Kai asked, the Purple Civet just blinked its eyes innocently, staring at him in confusion.

Now, it seemed it couldn’t understand him again...

“Playing dumb!” Yang Kai snorted coldly, but didn’t press further. With a wave of his sleeve and a buzzing sound, a cloud of Soul-Devouring Worms flew into the valley.

Seeing this, the Purple Civet waited expectantly.

It had clearly seen the Soul-Devouring Worms devour the poisonous mist before, so it knew the mist in this valley would be no exception.

As long as the poisonous mist was dispersed, the spirit fruit inside would be within easy reach!

And so it was. Wherever the dark cloud of worms passed, the thick poisonous mist vanished at a speed visible to the naked eye. All the Divine Sense poison was devoured by the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms, becoming nourishment for their own strength.

In less than half an hour, the poisonous mist in the valley was completely cleared away.

Having devoured so much poisonous mist, the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms seemed to have benefited greatly, buzzing as they flew back into Yang Kai’s sleeve.

“Let’s go!” Yang Kai called to the Purple Civet, striding into the valley as if strolling through his own backyard.

The Purple Civet strutted in as well, acting arrogant and overbearing, its little legs moving with exaggerated swagger...

“This must be the spirit fruit tree...” Yang Kai walked straight to the center of the valley, his gaze falling upon a tree about half as tall as a man, its entire body lush and verdant.

He had already noticed the tree from the valley entrance, but hadn’t dared to enter while the poisonous mist remained.

The tree exuded a unique aura, and traces of a large creature’s activity lingered nearby—likely left by the dead giant python.

Yang Kai’s gaze swept over the tree, and his eyes lit up.

He saw that there were five spirit fruits on the tree, identical to the one the Purple Civet had given him earlier.

As a Dao Origin-Grade alchemist who had inherited Gongsun Mu’s knowledge, Yang Kai could recognize items like the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, but he didn’t know what these spirit fruits were called.

All he could say was that these spirit fruits were unique to the Divine Roaming Mirror world, never seen outside.

Still, their effects were astonishingly powerful, especially for martial artists like Yang Kai who had entered this place from outside to temper themselves.

Without hesitation, he plucked a fruit from the tree, tossed it into his mouth, chewed a few times, and swallowed.

Instantly, not only did his discomfort ease, but even his soul felt a bit stronger.

“Not bad at all!” Yang Kai said, picking another fruit and eating it with relish.

“Gulp...”

A sound came from nearby.

Yang Kai glanced sideways at the Purple Civet crouched at his feet. The little fellow stared at him with big, round eyes, pitifully watching. The gulping sound had clearly come from it.

“Even if you look at me so sincerely...” Yang Kai said, tossing a third fruit into his mouth and speaking with his mouth full, “there’s none left for you!”

The Purple Civet’s eyes immediately dimmed, its head drooping in dejection.

“Sigh...” Yang Kai let out a long sigh. “Fine, I’ll give you one.”

As he spoke, he picked the last two fruits from the tree, ate one himself, and handed the other to the Purple Civet.

The Purple Civet perked up, eyes shining. It stood up straight, took the fruit with both paws, sniffed it carefully, showed a look of delight, and finally tucked it into the pouch on its belly like a treasured possession.

With four spirit fruits in his belly, plus the one the Purple Civet had given him earlier, all of Yang Kai’s discomfort was gone. He felt vigorous again, as if reborn.

He glanced at the Purple Civet and chuckled.

The Purple Civet immediately covered its pouch with both paws, watching Yang Kai warily, as if afraid he’d go back on his word.

“What do you take me for?” Yang Kai said sternly. “Don’t look down on me, you rascal. Once I give something away, I never take it back!”

The Purple Civet looked at him, half understanding.

“Little fellow...” Yang Kai smiled at it. “You know this place well?”

The Purple Civet was silent for a moment, then nodded.

“Then you lead the way. If we find any more good things, let’s split them like before, all right?” Yang Kai said kindly, patting the Purple Civet’s pouch. “As long as you work with me, it’s only a matter of time before your pouch is full.”

The Purple Civet’s eyes lit up, and it nodded enthusiastically, chirping excitedly.

Without waiting for further instructions, it took the lead again.

Yang Kai raised his brows and followed closely.

The Purple Civet was indeed very familiar with the Heavenly Yao Mountain. It knew where all the good things were, but most were guarded by powerful demonic beasts—like the giant python—far beyond what the Purple Civet could handle, so it could only sigh helplessly.

But with Yang Kai as a powerful backer, it had nothing to fear.

All it had to do was bring Yang Kai to the spot, let him deal with the guardian beast, and then they could happily split the spoils...

Yang Kai kept his word, always giving the Purple Civet a share of whatever they found. Whether the split was truly even, though, was open to interpretation.

In just two days, Yang Kai and the Purple Civet swept through the lairs of countless demonic beasts within tens of thousands of li, obtaining spirit fruits and Divine Soul Origins in great numbers—a tremendous harvest.

The spirit fruits growing in the Divine Roaming Mirror world were almost all beneficial to soul power.

But some were harmful. Yang Kai once ate one by mistake and became dizzy for a long time; if not for the Warm Spirit Lotus in his body, that single fruit might have cost him his life.

After all this, although Yang Kai absorbed a lot of Divine Soul Origin, his Spirit Body once again felt uncomfortable.

This state didn’t affect him much, but it meant he couldn’t absorb any more Divine Soul Origin for now.

Compared to Yang Kai, the Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms grew even more. Having devoured most of the Soul Incarnation power, in less than ten days since entering the Divine Roaming Mirror world, their strength had nearly doubled.

Moreover, Yang Kai vaguely sensed that his Soul-Devouring Worms were changing in some unknown way. He could clearly feel they were becoming more ferocious and unruly, sometimes even ignoring his commands.

Whether this was good or bad, he didn’t know.

Meanwhile, the Purple Civet’s belly pouch was nearly full.

Strangely, though it had gotten many good things, it never ate them—just kept stuffing the spirit fruits Yang Kai gave it into its pouch.

Eventually... it couldn’t fit any more.

It was small to begin with, and its pouch could only hold so much.

At last, Yang Kai had a legitimate reason to keep all the spoils for himself.

The Purple Civet didn’t seem to mind at all. It continued to lead the way diligently at the front, guiding Yang Kai through the Heavenly Yao Mountain in a carpet-sweep search, looking every bit like a laborer resigned to hard work.

Two days later, at the entrance of a cave, Yang Kai stood quietly, the Purple Civet squatting on his shoulder.

After these two days together, the Purple Civet was no longer afraid of Yang Kai, and had even grown quite familiar with him.

At this moment, both man and beast were focused, listening intently to the sounds coming from the cave, completely absorbed.
