## Chapter 2110 — Despair

As soon as Yang Kai finished speaking, someone darted in like lightning, swept his hand, and shut the door.

Looking at the newcomer, Yang Kai cupped his fists and smiled: “Sir Qin!”

The visitor was none other than the Qin Family’s patriarch, Qin Chaoyang.

“Brother Yang!” Qin Chaoyang returned the salute, his expression a bit awkward.

Yang Kai said, “Sir Qin, instead of recuperating in your clan, why have you come here?”

Qin Chaoyang’s complexion was poor, clearly still suffering from his injuries. What puzzled Yang Kai more was that he hadn’t come with Duan Yuanshan; he had come alone.

Yang Kai’s mind turned, and he understood what Qin Chaoyang wanted.

“My injuries are no longer a concern.” Qin Chaoyang waved his hand, found a seat, and said, “I heard you returned safely, so I hurried over. I didn’t expect the City Lord and the others to beat me to it.”

“So you were hiding outside?” Yang Kai chuckled.

“There are some things I can’t say in front of the City Lord.” Qin Chaoyang said awkwardly.

Yang Kai sighed, looking sincerely at Qin Chaoyang, "I think I know what you mean, but... forgive me for refusing."

Qin Chaoyang asked in surprise, “You knew before I even said anything?”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly, “Didn’t you come here to invite me to join your Qin Family?”

“Was I that obvious?” Qin Chaoyang was stunned.

Yang Kai nodded, “You’ve hinted at it several times before. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I’d be a fool. Besides… I hear the Jiang Family’s assets will be taken over by the Qin Family. With such a vast foundation, if the Qin Family swallows it whole without enough martial strength to intimidate others, I’m afraid it won’t deter those with restless ambitions.”

“You understand me!” Qin Chaoyang’s eyes lit up, nodding repeatedly, “Exactly! That’s why I came here. I want to invite you to be the Grand Elder of my Qin Family, equal in status to myself. If we join forces, the other old fellows won’t dare act recklessly!”

Yang Kai sighed, “I just refused the City Lord’s offer of the Deputy City Lord position!”

Qin Chaoyang’s face fell, disappointed, “I see…”

Both men were clever; Yang Kai didn’t need to explain much, and Qin Chaoyang knew he had no chance.

Yang Kai had just refused Duan Yuanshan’s invitation. If he immediately accepted Qin Chaoyang’s, he’d offend Duan Yuanshan. Duan Yuanshan would think Yang Kai looked down on him and might hold a grudge.

At that point, the Qin Family wouldn’t be able to stay out of it either.

Hiring a Grand Elder but offending the City Lord’s Mansion—such a deal wasn’t worth it. Qin Chaoyang understood this perfectly.

Looking at Qin Chaoyang, Yang Kai said with a hint of shame, “Originally, since Sir Qin taught me the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation, if the Qin Family ever needed my help, I would naturally not shirk. But in this matter… if I were to agree, it would only harm your Qin Family rather than benefit it. So I can only disappoint Sir Qin.”

“I understand.” Qin Chaoyang nodded.

“However…” Yang Kai changed the subject, “If the Qin Family ever needs help in the future, I can lend a hand as a friend. Please don’t hesitate to ask!”

Qin Chaoyang’s brows rose, and he laughed, “With your word, I’m at ease.”

He looked overjoyed, very pleased.

Although he didn’t achieve his original goal, Yang Kai’s promise made the trip worthwhile.

Qin Chaoyang said meaningfully, “Perhaps I’ll need your help very soon!”

Yang Kai nodded, “I’ll wait for your message.”

That day, Qin Chaoyang passed the complete Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation method to Yang Kai via jade slip. He only wanted a promise: that in a crisis, Yang Kai would protect Qin Yu’s safety. If the city fell, he could take Qin Yu away.

But things developed unexpectedly. The demonic calamity passed without danger, so the promise was void.

Yet Yang Kai had received a favor but refused their invitation, so he felt uneasy and wanted to repay it.

After a few more casual words, Qin Chaoyang got up to leave.

He was injured and needed to recuperate. Now the Qin Family was taking over the Jiang Family’s vast assets, the clan was busy, and his time was precious—he couldn’t linger.

After Qin Chaoyang left, Yang Kai finally had peace and quickly began to meditate.

The demonic transformation had left him weak; the power that had manifested—far beyond his cultivation—came at a price.

For several days, Yang Kai stayed in his room.

Until one day he opened his eyes; light shone, his spirit refreshed, and there was no trace of fatigue or weakness—he had fully recovered.

Checking his body, Yang Kai confirmed there were no lingering problems and felt at ease.

He didn’t go out immediately, but summoned the Xuan Realm Pearl, flashed, and entered the Small Xuan Realm.

The Small Xuan Realm was still peaceful. Yang Kai sensed briefly, then discovered an unusually powerful force surging in one area.

With a flicker, he arrived at that spot.

Ahead, Liu Yan sat cross-legged, one hand raised with two fingers pointing skyward, forming a gesture as she circulated her profound arts.

Her thunder-and-fire power was wild and restless. Within a radius of over ten li, lightning snakes danced and flames roared.

Behind Liu Yan, a huge phantom soared between heaven and earth, as if about to spread its wings and fly.

“Luan Feng!” Yang Kai glanced at the phantom and was startled.

The phantom was the image of the Ancient Divine Spirit Luan Feng he had once seen up close. It wasn’t a living being, just a projection.

Even as a projection, it radiated Divine Spirit aura. Black flames rolled on its surface, its imposing momentum overwhelming.

Liu Yan’s expression was extremely strained, as if she was performing a secret technique at a critical moment.

After watching for a while, Yang Kai realized she was refining the Luan Feng feather. Progress wasn’t especially smooth, but it wasn’t too difficult either.

He was powerless to help. Even as the Small Xuan Realm’s master, he couldn’t assist Liu Yan at all. She could only rely on her own will and determination.

If she succeeded, Liu Yan’s strength would surely increase. If she failed, she might suffer backlash!

Fortunately, Liu Yan had spent years refining herself by devouring Sun’s True Fire from Sun’s True Essence, so she was used to such intense energy. Otherwise, with just First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm strength, she couldn’t possibly refine the Luan Feng divine feather.

Even so, success or failure depended on her own fortune.

The Incarnation sat in the distance, closely watching Liu Yan’s condition.

Sensing the main body’s gaze, the Incarnation nodded slightly—everything was understood without words.

With the Incarnation watching, if anything happened to Liu Yan, Yang Kai would know immediately, so he left with peace of mind.

With another flicker, he arrived at another place in the Small Xuan Realm.

The area was empty, but a trembling figure sat hugging her knees, as if hiding in a corner—terrified and tormented. Her hair was disheveled, her face pale, her beautiful eyes warily scanning around, her features full of fear.

Yang Kai appeared before her, but she didn’t notice, as if she couldn’t see him.

"This..." Yang Kai watched her and murmured under his breath, "This should be about enough, right?"

With that, he snapped his fingers.

The sound wasn’t loud, but to Hua Qingsi’s ears it was like a morning bell or evening drum, shaking her to the core. She shuddered, and when she looked up, the endless darkness that had enveloped her was finally replaced by blinding light.

And the figure she had cursed countless times in her heart—wishing to tear him to pieces—appeared lazily not far away, watching her.

Seeing that face, all the grievance and fright Hua Qingsi had suffered over the past days turned into flames of vengeance. She shouted, “I’ll fight you to the death!”

As she spoke, she shot toward Yang Kai like an arrow.

Her body twisted, splitting into hundreds of butterflies that filled the sky and instantly wrapped around Yang Kai.

Yang Kai raised his hand, formed a knife with his palm, and ignored the hundreds of spirit butterflies, slashing straight at the void ahead.

With a thud… the palm knife struck something.

"Ouch..." Hua Qingsi’s figure stumbled out of the void; the butterflies vanished. She clutched her head and retreated, tears nearly streaming from the pain.

“It seems…” Yang Kai looked at her calmly, “You still haven’t understood your situation… In that case, I’ll give you more time. When you’ve thought it through… we’ll talk again!”

As he spoke, he prepared to repeat his trick.

Hua Qingsi suddenly screamed, “No! Please, I was wrong, I won’t be reckless again, spare me!”

Anyone trapped in endless darkness and killed countless times by strange beings—feeling the realistic sensation of death—could not endure.

The first time she was killed, Hua Qingsi thought she was truly dead!

But after a moment, she revived again…

Yet it was worse than death, because soon after, she was killed again by more bizarre beings.

After many repetitions, she finally understood she was caught in a masterful illusion, trapped in a cycle of life and death.

Dying hundreds of times a day, Hua Qingsi was nearly numb.

If not for her strength, such torment would have driven her mad.

Now, seeing Yang Kai—the culprit—her anger flared.

But she was subdued in one move!

Hua Qingsi was utterly in despair.

“Good, you’re so sensible—it pleases me!” Yang Kai glanced at her, nodded, and stood calmly in place.
