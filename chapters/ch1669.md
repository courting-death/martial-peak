## Chapter 1669 — The One Who Will Die Is You

Although the moonlike secret treasure possessed unfathomable power, Wei Guchang, repeatedly driving it, was paying a heavy price; during the fight he kept stuffing Spiritual Pills into his mouth to try and restore his Saint Yuan, but the effect was far from remarkable.

The five Origin Returning Realm cultivators besieging him and Xuan'er hesitated to strike decisively; they spared them for now, skirmishing at the edge to sap the two of their strength and Saint Yuan, as if intending to capture them alive.

Not far off, a figure who was a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm stood with his hands bound behind his back, his gaze cold and ruthless as he watched Wei Guchang and shouted: "Junior Nephew Wei, stop resisting—hand over the Heavenly Moon Silver Plate and this Senior won’t kill you!"

"Bah!" Wei Guchang spat in contempt; though his appearance was utterly battered, disdain covered his face. "Xie Chen, for you to once have been an elder of Yingyue Hall and yet be so cowardly as to cling to life—colluding with yao, bringing disaster on the sect, and now groveling as that thief’s lackey—hahaha… you want me to hand over the Heavenly Moon Silver Plate? Come take it by force if you can!"

Wei Guchang, drenched in blood, still could not blot out the heroic bearing that had always swelled within him.

Xie Chen’s expression chilled; killing intent flooded his eyes.

There was no doubt that Wei Guchang’s words had struck at his sore spot.

He took a deep breath, restraining his temper, and continued earnestly, “Wei, my good nephew, you’re a man of talent — do you not understand the saying, ‘A wise bird chooses the right tree to nest in’? On today’s Dark Star, that person’s power covers the heavens with a single hand; the glory of Yingyue Hall and the other great sects has long since faded. Your Uncle takes into account your youth and inexperience and does not wish to pursue this matter too harshly. Hand over the Heavenly Moon Silver Plate, and you may leave. Otherwise… your death matters little — but have you thought about Xuan’er? She’s in the prime of her youth and beauty; if she dies here with you, will you feel no guilt at all?”

Wei Guchang’s expression shifted; in the heat of battle he turned and glanced at Xuan'er, the feral blood-red ferocity in his eyes instantly softened into tenderness.

It had to be admitted that Xie Chen was old and crafty; in just a few words he had shattered Wei Guchang’s momentum.

Biting her silver teeth, Xuan'er cried out in a high, delicate voice, "Senior Brother, don’t listen to his mad talk—he is no longer our Senior. Xuan'er would count herself fulfilled to live and die with Senior Brother; under no circumstances will we hand over the Heavenly Moon Silver Plate!"

"Xuan'er…" Wei Guchang murmured her name.

At that moment Xie Chen’s eyes flashed with a murderous light; having held his hand this whole time, he suddenly surged with pure Saint Yuan and pointed toward Wei Guchang.

A jet of pitch-black radiance burst from his fingertip and struck Wei Guchang’s chest in the instant the latter was distracted.

Wei Guchang’s body jolted as if grievously wounded; he spat a mouthful of blood, and his already diminished aura quickly withered—staggering back over ten zhang, he still could not steady himself.

"Senior Brother!" Xuan'er screamed in terror; her wail was like a cuckoo’s blood-cry, piercingly tragic and tear-inducing.

Xie Chen’s face twisted into a savage grin as he laughed aloud, "You little brat dared oppose me—let’s see if you live or die; kill him!"

“Despicable!” Wei Guchang roared through gritted teeth. As several enemies charged toward him with fierce momentum, the radiance of countless Secret Treasures and secret arts burst forth, enveloping him completely. Yet he found himself unable to muster even a trace of Saint Yuan to defend, and the silver disk hovering above his head, once shining like a full moon, had gone dim — no longer able to display any power.

Death was beckoning him.

Strangely, at that instant Wei Guchang’s expression softened; he turned his gaze one last time toward Xuan'er, eyes full of shame and anguish.

Behind Xuan'er, two more Origin Returning Realm warriors unleashed brutal attacks toward her back.

Xuan'er smiled at him, and the whole world suddenly seemed to burst into brilliant color.

Before death came, the two said nothing—only a single, simple exchange of glances was enough to tell them both they were content; they had not been born on the same day, but to die on the same day—what else could one demand?

Wei Guchang reached for Xuan'er, and she likewise stretched out her jade hand.

Their palms clasped in midair as if body and soul had become one.

They embraced tightly, shut their eyes, and waited for death.

The terrified screams of their enemies rang in their ears, violent energy fluctuations crashed through the air, bones cracked—yet the death they had imagined did not come as expected…

Wei Guchang frowned, opened his eyes suspiciously, and saw a familiar face standing by his side, smiling at him.

Wei Guchang froze; his eyes widened as if he could hardly believe what he saw.

Rubbing his eyes hard to ensure the figure was no illusion, Wei Guchang finally cried out, "Brother Yang!"

The man at his side was none other than Yang Kai.

Wei Guchang’s heart hammered.

Yang Kai had long since left the Dark Star to voyage into the vast Star Domain—Wei Guchang knew this, having heard Fei Zhi Tu mention it more than once, each time with regret and chagrin.

If not for his own fall in cultivation back then, he too could have left with Yang Kai to witness the wonders of the Star Domain.

But at that critical juncture something happened to him and his cultivation declined.

In the end, from Yingyue Hall, only Qian Tong had followed Yang Kai away.

Yang Kai’s departure had lasted seven or eight years with no word—no one knew if they were safe or living well in the Star Domain.

Yet today, at this desperate moment, Yang Kai had miraculously appeared and had saved their lives!

If Yang Kai had returned, where was Elder Qian? Wei Guchang hurriedly glanced around, but aside from two unfamiliar yet stunningly beautiful women, he saw no sign of Elder Qian.

A weight sank into Wei Guchang’s heart.

“Elder Qian is doing quite well, Brother Wei, you need not worry,” Yang Kai said, immediately understanding what was on his mind and offering some reassurance. “It’s been many years since we last met, Brother Wei… hmm, your bearing is as impressive as ever.”

Hearing Yang Kai’s teasing, Wei Guchang cracked a grin; blood at the corner of his mouth made his visage look all the more fierce and wild. "Brother Yang, are you mocking me?"

"Heaven forbid!"

"Senior Brother… let me go first," Xuan’er’s tiny voice entered Wei Guchang’s ears like that of an insect.

He paused and remembered he was still holding Xuan'er tightly and had not yet released her.

The soft body in his arms was rapidly heating; the scent of her breath made Wei Guchang’s thoughts wander, and the fullness at his chest made him reluctant to let go.

The two fellow disciples had loved each other for years but had never been so intimate; only at the brink of death had they cast aside everything.

Gently loosening his hold, Wei Guchang scratched his head, "Sorry to make Brother Yang laugh."

Xuan'er blushed and stood aside with a shy smile, head bowed in silence.

Su Yan and Xia Ningshang exchanged a glance and smiled knowingly.

"Seeing Wei and Miss Dong reveal true feelings in hardship moves me deeply—how could that be mockery?" Yang Kai said earnestly, then lifted his eyes to look ahead and asked calmly, "What is going on? Since I left, it seems Yingyue Hall has undergone a great upheaval."

At this, Wei Guchang’s expression cooled. "Not just Yingyue Hall— the entire Dark Star has been turned upside down. It’s too much to explain now, but this man was once a high-ranking figure in Yingyue Hall with great power; now he’s defected to the enemy, wreaking havoc, even killing the former Hall Master and imprisoning City Lord Fei!"

"He killed the former Hall Master and imprisoned City Lord Fei?" Yang Kai’s face showed shock.

"That’s right."

"You little bastard, so it’s you!" On the other side, Xie Chen glared at Yang Kai with grim hostility, as if the two shared an unbridgeable grudge. He laughed wildly to the sky, "All my searching was for nothing, yet you come to me now like a gift. Good—today I will kill you and avenge my dead child!"

"You know me?" Yang Kai eyed him warily.

Xie Chen snarled, "Ten years ago, Xie Hongwen died by your hand—do you remember?"

"Xie Hongwen?" Yang Kai frowned, then recalled, "You mean the young master of the Xie Family who ambushed me in the Flowing Flame Sandland."

"Correct!"

"So you are related to that Xie Hongwen?" Yang Kai put the pieces together.

"Indeed I am! Today I avenge my Nephew and my Elder Brother! Little bastard, any last words?" Xie Chen roared, his eyes reddening like a crazed beast.

Yang Kai sneered. “Xie Hongwen and Xie Li brought their own deaths upon themselves — they have no one else to blame.”

"You murderer, how dare you twist things—fine, since you say so, today your death will be your own fault as well!" Xie Chen howled hysterically.

Yang Kai scoffed and shook his head, "Old fool, you are wrong—today,the one who dies will be you."

Xie Chen laughed, "You brash child, do you think I’ll listen to your nonsense?"

"Whether you listen is your business. Since this concerns Yingyue Hall I won’t meddle further—let Elder Qian clean up the mess." Yang Kai did not want to bicker with Xie Chen any longer; he communicated via Divine Sense with the Xuan Realm Pearl to inform Qian Tong, then pointed forward.

"Elder Qian…" Wei Guchang’s face brightened and he scanned the area. "Where is Elder Qian?"

"Is my master also here?" Xuan'er asked, surprised and delighted.

"He is." Yang Kai grinned and a subtle power sprang from his fingertips; a vortex began to form before them.

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er’s attention was drawn to it; tense and expectant, they watched as an aged figure stepped out from the whirlpool.

Qian Tong!

"What is this!" Xie Chen’s face changed as he stared at the eerie vortex, baffled at how Qian Tong could emerge from it—this whirlpool seemed to lead to another world.

But quickly his gaze fixed on Qian Tong with obvious dread.
