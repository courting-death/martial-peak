## Chapter 443 — The Master's Partiality

Xia Ningshang clearly did not want to continue discussing this topic. Her delicate brows furrowed slightly as she gently said, “Aunt Xiang, isn’t it somewhat improper for Yao Wang Valley to send out so many people this time...?”

She spoke while glancing back.

Behind the four women stood Old Meng wearing expressions of worry and sighing deeply. Just the thought of having to face that bastard Yang Kai again made them feel pity for their precious disciple.

But since their apprentice was so wholeheartedly infatuated with him, Meng Wuya could only helplessly sigh. Matters of love and attachment were beyond his control. With no other recourse, he forced a smile more pitiful than tears.

Behind Shopkeeper Meng, a vast group of people marched forth, all clad in white robes, numbering no less than thirty. Among them, the strongest was Qin Ze, who led the way. His cultivation was merely at the second stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. The weakest among them was only at the peak of Separation and Union. Such a group, if taken into battle, would be described only as utterly feeble.

Yet these were alchemists from Yao Wang Valley! Though their martial prowess was lacking, their existences commanded respect. Wherever they went, no one would dare strike first.

Alchemists were also graded, corresponding to heavenly materials and earthly treasures: Common-Grade, Earth-Grade, Heaven-Grade, and Mystery-Grade. Each grade was subdivided into upper, middle, and lower ranks.

On their chests, alchemists bore distinctive marks indicating their level.

A single petal represented one grade, while gold, silver, and white colors denoted the upper, middle, and lower ranks respectively. From the embroidery on their garments, their skill level was immediately evident.

Each of these Yao Wang Valley alchemists wore at least two petals embroidered on their chests, half of them three petals, and Qin Ze led them with four petals!

Four petals were the symbol of Mystery-Grade!

Across the entire Great Han, only dozens of alchemists were qualified to wear the four-petal mark. A quarter of them were concentrated in Yao Wang Valley.

Those with three petals were Heaven-Grade alchemists, capable of effortlessly refining Heaven-Grade pills, while two petals marked Earth-Grade.

“Senior Aunt, what are your orders?” Qin Ze quickly approached Xia Ningshang when she looked back, addressing her respectfully, thinking she might assign him a task.

Xia Ningshang felt somewhat embarrassed. “Senior Qin, please don’t address me that way. I am younger than you and cannot bear such a title.”

Qin Ze shook his head solemnly. “This won’t do. Since Senior Aunt Xiao has informed Yao Wang Valley that he regards you as an equal, whatever your age, you are my Senior Aunt!”

Xia Ningshang smiled wryly, at a loss for words.

Originally, she had only intended to travel to Zhongdu with Meng Wuya to assist with Yang Kai’s succession war, but at Xiao Fusheng’s command, thirty Yao Wang Valley disciples were summoned to accompany her.

Xia Ningshang had been at Hidden Cloud Peak for so long that only the people there knew of her profound alchemical talent.

Alchemists were a proud and haughty group. At first, Qin Ze and the others looked down on Xia Ningshang, but one sentence from Xiao Fusheng stunned them all.

This Xia Ningshang's alchemical skill rivaled his own, and even surpassed it. Given time, she would surely reach heights that even Xiao Fusheng had not.

Qin Ze refused to believe such a thing—who under heaven could compare to Master Xiao?

Relying on his recent promotion to Mystery-Grade alchemist, griped with confidence, he challenged Xia Ningshang to a duel.

The result was a crushing defeat! Only then did he truly respect her and dare not show any disrespect again.

Alchemists were straightforward in this regard—not deceitful like others. To command their respect, one must conquer them with their skills. In a sense, alchemists were sincerely honest people.

The disciples of Yao Wang Valley usually found it extremely difficult to meet Xiao Fusheng and learn alchemical insights from him. Now a top-tier alchemist nearly equal to him appeared—so young, too—and naturally earned respect.

These thirty individuals, once reluctant, now willingly followed Xia Ningshang to learn her alchemical arts.

But Xia Ningshang knew full well that Xiao Fusheng painstakingly assembling thirty alchemists to follow her and sharing his art was actually a covert way to assist Yang Kai.

“It’s none of your business. Ningshang is just talking to me,” Aunt Xiang waved her hand dismissively.

Qin Ze obeyed without complaint and immediately retreated, leading the thirty alchemists in close pursuit.

“It seems Yao Wang Valley has never taken part in a succession war before. This reckless intervention will surely draw criticism,” Xia Ningshang worried.

Aunt Xiang smiled softly. “Ignore such talk. No one has the right to judge Yao Wang Valley’s actions. But the Master truly cares for Yang Kai. If not, how could he have invoked the Elder’s Order to mobilize thirty men from the half-recovered Yao Wang Valley? He even ordered both Aunt Lan and me to come along, fearing for Yang Kai’s safety.”

Xia Ningshang quietly nodded.

How could Xiao Fusheng not care about Yang Kai? Yang Kai had twice brought him two sets of precious alchemical spirit formations. The Master had been utterly absorbed in their study these days, neglecting sleep and meals. To him, those formations were treasures surpassing all else. Could he not care for Yang Kai’s well-being?

What talk of Yao Wang Valley maintaining neutrality for thousands of years, or of avoiding worldly conflicts—all failed before those spirit formations!

The Master had even quarreled with the Yao Wang Valley’s Valley Chief over this, nearly causing a dispute.

Recalling the Master’s stubborn protection, Xia Ningshang could not help but smile.

After some time walking, dusk fell and the group stopped to rest by a riverbank.

Looking toward the direction of War City, Xia Ningshang’s heart swelled with anticipation. Tomorrow, she would meet her junior brother. What should she say upon seeing him?

For a while, Xia Ningshang lost herself in thought.

...

Inside Yang Kai's manor.

Incense smoke curled upward, filling the entire room with fragrance. The True Yang Technique was slowly operating as though bearing the weight of a mountain. Yang Kai remained deeply immersed, absorbing the secrets and mysteries passed down from the True Alchemy Formula, comprehending the complex laws of heaven and earth hidden within. Unconsciously, his realm ascended.

As he delved deeper into the True Alchemy Formula, Yang Kai became increasingly aware of its rarity. His expressions altered constantly—sometimes shocked, sometimes excited, sometimes confused—his countenance a reflection of myriad emotions.

Unaware of how much time had passed, Yang Kai remained absorbed in the formula, oblivious to the outside world. His entire being radiated a strange brilliance as he focused with utter sincerity on understanding and assimilating it.

The insights of countless alchemical masters merged into his mind.

A fresh vision unfurled slowly before him. Through glimpsing the True Alchemy Formula, he gained a deeper understanding of the martial arts’ true essence, progressing to the First Stage of comprehension.

An urge stirred within him to test himself, eager to try refining his first pill and witness the splendid glow upon its success.

Yet recalling Xiao Fusheng's words, Yang Kai forced down his desires.

“No Divine Roaming, no alchemy!” he reminded himself. For now, his primary goal remained breaking into the Divine Roaming Realm. Once there, he would have ample time for alchemical experiments.

A martial artist’s strength depended not only on True Yuan accumulation and physical training but most critically on their understanding and wisdom. Thus, when facing bottlenecks, warriors seldom secluded themselves completely. Instead, roaming about often led to unexpected breakthroughs.

Yang Kai sensed that probing the mysteries of the True Alchemy Formula would not only strengthen his Divine Sense but also greatly aid his realm advancement.

Lost in these thoughts, he did not notice time passing until finally regaining full awareness.

Opening his eyes, the True Yang Technique still operated slowly, but now notably faster than before. His True Yuan had adapted to the pressure, and its flow would only hasten.

Moreover, his True Yuan Realm at the Eighth Stage seemed to surge forward immensely.

He exhaled gently, joy filling his heart.

Rising, he packed away the incense burner into the Black Book Space. Pure True Yuan condensed at his fingertips, swirling rapidly with immense attraction, absorbing the incense’s fragrance throughout the room.

The incense’s power was overwhelming. Apart from someone bearing a Proud Bone Golden Body like himself, anyone below Divine Roaming would likely be poisoned fatally by its scent upon entering.

Opening the door, Yang Kai stepped outside.

He had secluded himself for days. The people Chen Xueshu mentioned should have arrived by now. As their host, he ought to appear and greet them.

Walking down the winding corridor, halfway through, Yang Kai spotted Lan Chudie and Luo Xiaoman chatting nearby.

The two women stood there, captivating anyone’s gaze with their shapely figures and equally affluent resources. A mesmerizing aura swirled enticingly between their chests, as if to pull people in.

They clearly shared much in common...

“Senior Sister Lan, Miss Luo!” Yang Kai greeted.

Lan Chudie turned, smiling happily. Luo Xiaoman appeared startled, her face paling.

“So scared of me?” Yang Kai chuckled, looking playfully at Luo Xiaoman, who darted her eyes, trying to hide but found nowhere to go. Her calves wobbled as she looked beseechingly at Lan Chudie.

“Junior Brother, don’t bully her.” Lan Chudie scolded Yang Kai with a glance, then suddenly paused and took out a handkerchief, wiping his face, explaining with a smile, “You’re a bit dirty. Junior Brother, you should wash properly; after all, you now have status.”

Yang Kai allowed her intimate gesture, a subtle smile lifting his lips, meaning clear: “Senior Sister Lan is thoughtful. I shall be mindful.”
