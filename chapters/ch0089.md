## Chapter 89 — The Azure Blood Mysterious Yang Flower

After traveling through the Black Wind Mountain for several days, Yang Kai was astonished to find that they had encountered hardly any dangerous beasts along the way.

Originally, he had been filled with worry. After all, the Black Wind Mountain was teeming with powerful beasts, and with his current strength, if he truly met one, he would only become a burden to Xia Ningshang.

Yet Xia Ningshang clearly came well-prepared. By some means unknown to him, she managed to lead Yang Kai safely past the dominant beasts lurking within the forest.

Their path was erratic and unpredictable—sometimes veering east, other times west, often making large detours. Yet, despite these twists and turns, their journey remained remarkably safe. Occasionally, they encountered a few low-level beasts of the second or third rank, but under Xia Ningshang’s hands, they were driven off within a few moves.

After careful observation, Yang Kai finally understood that Xia Ningshang was using a jade-green bracelet on her wrist to detect the presence and direction of powerful beasts.

Whenever a troublesome beast blocked their path ahead, the bracelet would emit a faint green glow.

This bracelet was something she had never worn before. Her only ornament was the sapphire set on her forehead. Thus, this bracelet must have been specially prepared for this journey.

It was undoubtedly a secret treasure! Yang Kai, having some discernment, guessed that this treasure was likely a gift from Shopkeeper Meng.

Who exactly was this old Meng? Yang Kai found himself increasingly puzzled. How could a mere Contribution Hall shopkeeper accept a prodigious disciple like Xia Ningshang and even bestow such a treasure? This bracelet was no ordinary trinket. Though its grade was unknown, Yang Kai estimated it to be at least Earth-Grade. Such treasures were rare within Lingxiao Pavilion.

In stark contrast to the ease with which Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang advanced, the Blood Battle Gang trailing behind them was enduring a living hell.

Over the past few days, they had fought more than a dozen battles, large and small. Had it not been for their considerable strength, they would have long since become prey to the beasts.

Although Wen Feichen was a formidable True Essence Realm expert at the fifth stage, his condition was far from ideal. Just recently, the group had come face to face with a peak fifth-rank beast. A peak fifth-rank beast was equivalent to a True Essence Realm master at the pinnacle, several levels above Wen Feichen’s strength.

A grueling battle ensued. Despite their numerical advantage allowing them to drive the beast away, the Blood Battle Gang suffered the loss of a Separation and Union Realm expert!

Wen Feichen was furious beyond measure.

This time, the Blood Battle Gang had only eight members in total. Wen Feichen was the sole True Essence Realm cultivator. Four others were at the Separation and Union Realm, and the rest were at the Qi Movement Realm, among whom Long Hui was the weakest, only at the first stage of Qi Movement.

They had assumed that by following far behind Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang, they would avoid major dangers. But who could have known what methods those two used to evade the beasts? Instead, those trailing behind faced continuous battles.

Now, with the loss of a Separation and Union Realm expert, how could Wen Feichen remain calm?

Yet, having committed this far, there was no turning back. They had already lost one; could they abandon the mission halfway?

After a brief rest, Wen Feichen snapped at Nu Lang without hesitation, “Lead the way forward. We must move out!”

Nu Lang stared at the severed limbs on the ground, his mind reeling. Just now, the Blood Battle Gang had lost a man, and how could the minor figures from Fengyu Tower remain unscathed?

Two Fengyu Tower disciples had been swallowed whole by the fifth-rank beast, leaving only half an arm behind.

At last, he understood why that night had felt so ominous. The Blood Battle Gang had no intention of kindly guiding them to find Yang Kai; they were clearly using Fengyu Tower’s disciples as expendable scouts!

But even with this realization, Nu Lang dared not complain, let alone resist! Leading the way forward, there was still a chance of survival. To resist now would only mean certain death.

Pale-faced, Nu Lang led the Fengyu Tower disciples ahead, while Wen Feichen’s orders echoed behind them, directing them east and west, yet never losing sight of Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang.

At this moment, Yang Kai, who was following Xia Ningshang, suddenly stopped and turned his gaze toward a certain direction, a gleam of joy flickering in his eyes.

“What is it?” Xia Ningshang asked, also halting.

“Is there any danger over there?” Yang Kai pointed to the side.

“I don’t think so. I sense no trace of beasts,” Xia Ningshang replied, lowering her gaze to her bracelet.

“Then let’s go take a look,” Yang Kai said without hesitation, dashing forward.

Though Xia Ningshang did not understand the cause of his sudden excitement, she could only follow.

After less than a hundred zhang, Xia Ningshang suddenly felt a wave of heat wash over her face, reddening her cheeks. Looking ahead, she saw a sunlit clearing adorned with numerous palm-sized flowers of a brilliant crimson hue.

There were quite a few flowers—roughly a dozen or more.

Yang Kai was already busily plucking them, showing no hesitation.

After a short while, he returned, triumphant. “Do you recognize these?”

“Azure Blood Mysterious Yang Flowers, a lower-level Earth-Grade material. So this is why you came here,” Xia Ningshang exclaimed, suddenly enlightened.

“Lower-Level Earth-Grade!” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “Not bad at all.”

He could sense that the Yang attribute energy contained within each of these flowers was no less than that of a Three Yang Fruit. It was precisely because the Yang Source Seal on his chest had reacted that he had come here to investigate—and indeed, he had reaped a great harvest.

This place was already deep within Black Wind Mountain. Naturally, treasures of Heaven and Earth would not be scarce. But since their mission was to assist Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai could not afford to waste time searching everywhere.

Such wandering would be too time-consuming and fraught with risk.

Yet, having sensed these nearby, they could not let the opportunity slip by.

“Do you want me to refine them into pills for you?” Xia Ningshang asked.

“Not yet. I’ll wait until we rest tonight,” Yang Kai replied.

Though Xia Ningshang’s pill refining skills were extraordinary, the process consumed Primordial Qi. Traveling through dense forest, Yang Kai preferred to be cautious and avoid unnecessary expenditure.

“Very well,” Xia Ningshang nodded. “We’re not far from that place. Another two or three days’ journey at most. We have ample time.”

Perhaps fortune was on their side. After several days without response, Yang Kai’s Yang Source Seal had finally reacted upon finding these dozen Azure Blood Mysterious Yang Flowers. Just one day later, he discovered more Yang-attributed treasures nearby.

However, this time luck was not as favorable. These Yang-attributed herbs were guarded by a third-rank beast.

They had no choice but to call upon Xia Ningshang to drive the beast away before Yang Kai could claim the herbs.

On this day, as the two crossed the forest, they suddenly arrived at the edge of an immense valley. Xia Ningshang exhaled deeply. “Junior Brother, we have arrived!”
