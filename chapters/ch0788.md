## Chapter 788 — Wolves in Front, Tigers Behind

Both Feng Biao and Yu Mo clearly prided themselves on their status and cultivation, unwilling to consort with other demons; confident in their own strength, they kept a subtle distance from Yang Kai.

This gave Yang Kai an opportunity.

With a soft crack, wind and thunder surged, and behind Yang Kai the Wind-and-Thunder Wings unfurled in brilliant, exaggerated splendor.

As the wings beat, his already swift speed shot up; An Ling'er, whom he held, couldn't help squinting as she circulated her True Yuan to resist the countering gale, their clothes rustling and hair streaming behind them.

In an instant they had slipped beyond the range of Feng Biao's and Yu Mo's Divine Sense.

An Ling'er couldn't help but give a delighted cry; though she had seen Yang Kai deploy the Wind-and-Thunder Wings before—during their escape from Saintess Nan—no matter how many times she saw them she remained intoxicated by their beauty.

Such a pair of wings should not belong to a man; they seemed made for a woman.

Even glancing at Yang Kai, she felt he looked unusually heroic in that moment.

An Ling'er lightly pressed her red lips, looked at Yang Kai's profile with a dreamy gaze, and unconsciously leaned against him, looping an arm around his.

"Hey, can you fawn later and pay attention to the situation?" Yang Kai immediately noticed her oddness and shot her a glare; at his elbow he felt astonishing springiness and softness that nearly deflated his momentum.

An Ling'er's face flushed; she protested stubbornly, "No, don't say that—it's just that the outside world is so wonderful. It's completely different from what I imagined in the Sacred Land."

Since meeting Yang Kai, An Ling'er's life had become thrilling—an excitement that terrified her yet exhilarated her. It seemed that as long as Yang Kai was at her side, any peril could be turned to safety.

"Most people don't have such an exciting life!" Yang Kai curled his mouth. The wings beat steadily; his body streaked like a long rainbow, gaining speed.

The demons trailing behind him all changed expressions; they had been able to see Yang Kai moments before, but in that instant his figure had vanished.

Among their ranks the two or three Saint Realm experts wore astonished faces; not daring to slack, they quickened their pursuit.

The next moment two figures flew over them in succession—Feng Biao and Yu Mo, who had sensed something was wrong and accelerated.

Both looked particularly grave, especially Yu Mo; only now did he realize that even in his death struggle with Di Xiao, Yang Kai had concealed methods.

With that jaw-dropping speed alone, Yang Kai could have toyed with Di Xiao, yet he only revealed it now—clearly long prepared—making him impossible to guard against.

As a result, Yang Kai instantly slipped beyond the range of their Divine Sense.

"That brat!" Yu Mo looked embarrassed, cursing as he strained to pursue.

Another hour later, the demons who had been tailing them finally slowed and gave up the chase; they had no idea which direction Yang Kai and the Saint Realm experts had gone, and without a target they could not pursue, so one by one they trudged back to Sand City in dejection.

Two thousand li from Sand City, Yang Kai's expression turned serious.

He realized he'd underestimated the Saint Realm experts' methods; although his Wind-and-Thunder Wings had momentarily broken their Divine Sense, by some means they still accurately located him and clung to his trail.

The Demon Domain was vast; unsure if his bearing was correct, Yang Kai sought desolate routes to flee, hoping to break out of the Demon Domain.

Potent, surging Divine Sense played a crucial role now—though Yang Kai's body was only Transcendent Second Stage, his Divine Sense rivaled that of the Saint Realm.

It was in no way inferior to Feng Biao's or Yu Mo's, and in some respects even surpassed them.

With that aid, Yang Kai could avoid areas of concentrated population to prevent other demons from discovering him and inviting unnecessary trouble.

After long flight Yang Kai was beginning to falter; both his physical strength and spirit were greatly depleted, and An Ling'er looked especially listless, clearly exhausted.

Stop-and-go flight still couldn't shake Feng Biao and Yu Mo; the other Saint Realm experts had long since given up after several days, but those two clung to Yang Kai like rabid dogs, making him endlessly vexed.

Those two, who had long disliked and opposed each other, seemed to be converging because of this chase.

Half a month passed, then a month...

Yang Kai had already driven An Ling'er for hundreds of thousands of li within the Demon Domain; the demonic aura in the air gradually thinned, jolting him—he quietly judged his direction was likely correct, and if he continued this course he would surely leave the Demon Domain.

Once out of the Demon Domain, Feng Biao and Yu Mo would likely have no choice but to desist.

Seeing hope, Yang Kai's spirits lifted at once.

That day, while flying, Yang Kai's face changed; he suddenly halted and peered intently at a dense wood ahead.

Ahead he sensed numerous experts lying in ambush, seemingly waiting for him to walk into their net.

As he paused, a pair of eyes emitting a cold light in the forest also spotted Yang Kai.

"Such a wary brat!" the demon expert inwardly praised with surprise; the auras of his companions had been concealed perfectly, blending with the surroundings, yet a flaw had been revealed and they had been discovered.

"What are you skulking about for? Come out!" Yang Kai observed a moment, inhaled, and suddenly shouted.

The man grinned, stopped hiding, shot into the sky, and brazenly approached Yang Kai.

Watching the approaching demon expert, Yang Kai's face registered suspicion—he did not recognize the man, but by their posture it was clear they had been waiting for him and An Ling'er.

This man's cultivation was not weak—roughly Saint Realm; even if slightly inferior to Feng Biao and Yu Mo it was not by much, and behind him more formidable-looking figures appeared, all curiously sizing up Yang Kai.

A sound came from behind; Yang Kai's face darkened as he realized Feng Biao and Yu Mo had also arrived.

Sure enough, moments later the two mad-dog fellows materialized and flanked Yang Kai from the rear.

"Yu Mo, is this the human brat who escaped from Sand City?" the demon expert blocking the front asked nonchalantly, looking Yang Kai over.

Yu Mo's face was cold; he gave a slight nod, "Hm," then snapped at Yang Kai, "Brat, you run fast—if I hadn't sent word to the Barbarian City Lord, you might not have been stopped!"

He spoke with an expression full of hidden hatred.

He had accepted Xueli's order, thinking he could easily seize Yang Kai and haul him back, but who would have thought the chase would drag on for a full month and nearly kill him from exhaustion.

In a sullen mood, he secretly vowed that once he caught Yang Kai he'd make him suffer to ease his grudge.

Hearing Yu Mo, Yang Kai understood: during the pursuit they had somehow transmitted a message to the Barbarian City Lord, who had laid an ambush here in readiness.

Yang Kai smiled wryly; after all, he was on their turf—though he could flee for a while, being blocked today felt like having no way out.

While Yu Mo spoke with the Barbarian City Lord, Feng Biao stood aside with an indifferent air, his eyes constantly scanning as if assessing the situation.

His aim differed from Yu Mo's—he intended to kill Yang Kai to fulfill Lord Gou Qiong's orders; now that Yu Mo had called reinforcements, Feng Biao found the matter troublesome.

His twitching ambition did not escape Yu Mo, and the Barbarian City Lord pondered, chuckling, "Isn't that Feng Biao? Why aren't you staying in Qingliao City serving Lord Gou Qiong—what are you doing out here in the wastelands?"

Yu Mo snorted, "Feng Biao, I won't trouble you today—leave."

Feng Biao coldly snorted, glared at Yang Kai with venom, then glanced at Yu Mo and stepped back a pace, saying lightly, "You can capture him yourselves; I won't interfere. But I'll report everything to Lord Gou Qiong—let's see if you can bear the consequences."

Seeing his stance, Yu Mo stopped wasting words and sneered at Yang Kai, "Brat, will you surrender, or shall I seize you? I'll warn you—if I have to act, you may suffer some injury."

"You're that confident you can catch me?" Yang Kai smiled calmly.

The Barbarian City Lord's eyes nearly bulged; astonished he cried, "Yu Mo, what is the background of this human brat—his mouth is bigger than the heavens."

How dare he make such boasts before several Saint Realm experts—had he lost his mind?

"He has cause for arrogance—he killed Di Xiao one-on-one in Sand City's Death Arena!" Yu Mo explained softly.

"What?" The Barbarian City Lord's face changed; he exclaimed, "You're not mistaken? That Di Xiao was killed by him? I thought Di Xiao was a Third Stage Transcendent!"

"I saw it with my own eyes—how could I be wrong? Moreover... when he killed Di Xiao he was only First Stage; he only broke through to his current realm after killing Di Xiao."

"Really?" The Barbarian City Lord looked incredulous, flustered and utterly shocked.

"Otherwise why do you think Feng Biao chased him with me for a month?" Yu Mo gritted his teeth. "Damn it—don't bring it up, it's embarrassing."

"Hahaha!" The Barbarian City Lord laughed loudly, mocking, "No way—you chased him for a month and still didn't catch him?"

His laughter faded and his face turned stern; he said gravely, "So it seems the brat truly has talent."
