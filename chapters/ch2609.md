## Chapter 2609 — Stumbled Upon a Good Show

Outside the pavilion, Fan Wu, Cang Gou, and Luan Feng, the three Saint Venerables, stood there with bitter expressions. Yang Kai had accepted their gifts but showed no reaction, leaving them extremely uneasy. In fact, they hadn’t even seen Yang Kai himself this time—only the woman who always accompanied him came out to speak.

After a long while, Cang Gou finally said, “Could it be that he thinks our gifts are too meager and wants even more?”

Fan Wu shot him a glance and said, “We’ve already given him a tenth of all we own. You call that meager?”

“I’m just afraid he won’t be satisfied.” Cang Gou looked worried and said with disgust, “You all know how greedy humans are.”

Luan Feng sighed, “If he’s not satisfied, what can we do? We’ll probably have to spend even more to ward off disaster. By the way, you two didn’t keep any of Shi Huo’s inheritance for yourselves, did you?”

Cang Gou curled his lip and said, “You checked Shi Huo’s things yourself, Lady Feng. Can’t you tell if we kept anything?”

Luan Feng nodded, “I was just asking.”

Fan Wu smiled bitterly, “He’s staying in the Ancient Land under the pretense of healing his wounds, so we can’t very well ask him to leave. If something really happens, and that descendant of Heaven’s Punisher comes out of the Blood Gate, we won’t be able to bear the consequences!”

At the mention of Heaven’s Punisher’s descendant, both Luan Feng and Cang Gou couldn’t help but turn pale, clearly extremely apprehensive.

The three exchanged glances, sighing and groaning, secretly plagued by headaches.

Just then, all three seemed to sense something and turned to look back. From the direction of the pavilion, Ji Yao walked over and called out, “Saint Venerables, please wait!”

Fan Wu and the others felt a jolt in their hearts, wondering if Yang Kai had further instructions. Could it be that he was dissatisfied with the contents of the four Spatial Rings and wanted even more? If so, that would be truly shameless.

Luan Feng forced a smile and said politely, “Miss, does Sir Yang have any other requests?”

Ji Yao glanced at her calmly and said, “My master asked me to inform you all that the injuries are fully healed, and we’ll be leaving the Ancient Land tomorrow.”

“What?” Cang Gou exclaimed in delight, “Is that true?”

He was a Saint Venerable, yet upon hearing that Yang Kai was leaving the Ancient Land, he couldn’t help but lose his composure. As soon as he spoke, Fan Wu quietly kicked him.

Cang Gou’s expression changed at once. He quickly shut his mouth, looking embarrassed.

Ji Yao didn’t even glance at him. After relaying Yang Kai’s message, she turned and left the way she came.

Once Ji Yao’s figure disappeared, the three looked at each other and saw the relief in each other’s eyes. Fan Wu gave a subtle signal, and the three, suppressing their joy, quickly left. Only then did they breathe a collective sigh of relief.

Cang Gou laughed, “We finally got rid of him. It seems Sir Yang isn’t as greedy as we feared.”

If Yang Kai had really demanded more, they would have had no choice but to prepare for another round of heavy losses.

"Spending money to avoid disaster, spending money to avoid disaster…" Fan Wu was in high spirits. In this world, only Yang Kai could extort them and still have them so willing. If it were anyone else, the three Saint Venerables would have put up a real fight.

“Since he’s leaving tomorrow, I’ll personally see him off. Wouldn’t want to be rude.” Luan Feng said with a smile.

Fan Wu nodded, “That’s proper. I’ll leave it to you, Madam Feng.”

Luan Feng waved her hand and smiled bitterly, “He’s staying in my place, after all. The Ancient Land is our territory. If anything happened to him here, no one could bear that responsibility.”

The three chatted for a while longer. Then Fan Wu and Cang Gou took their leave.

When they arrived, both were anxious and uneasy, but on the way back, they were completely relaxed and overjoyed—their moods were like night and day.

……

In the time that followed, Yang Kai didn’t refine any more Spiritual Pills. Instead, he began sorting through the items in the four Spatial Rings.

Source Crystals, Inner Cores, and such were easy enough to handle.

He sorted everything by category and grade, tossing them all into the Small Xuan Realm, piling them into small mountains of various sizes to retrieve as needed.

Only the more than a hundred thousand stalks of Imperial-Grade Spiritual Medicine took Yang Kai a great deal of effort. These medicines were all rare and precious, so Yang Kai had to check and store each one carefully to preserve their potency as much as possible.

After an entire night of work, he had sorted less than a tenth of the Spiritual Medicines.

The next morning, Yang Kai, accompanied by Ji Yao and led by the maid Tianlong, walked out of Fengluo Palace and saw Luan Feng waiting outside.

“Sir Yang!” Luan Feng called out as soon as she saw Yang Kai, hurrying over to greet him.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and said with a light laugh, “I’ve troubled you these days, Lady Feng. My injuries have healed, so it’s time for me to leave. As for the Stone Spirit Race, I’ll have to trouble you and the other two Saint Venerables to look after them.”

Luan Feng smiled, “Rest assured, Sir Yang. As long as the three of us are here, the Stone Spirit Race will not be mistreated in the Ancient Land.”

Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction.

Luan Feng said, “There are many restrictions in the Ancient Land, and the journey is long. Allow me to escort you.”

Yang Kai didn’t refuse her kindness. He simply nodded, then soared into the sky, with Ji Yao quickly following.

Luan Feng’s figure flickered, and she instantly appeared beside Yang Kai and Ji Yao. Her surging Yao Yuan enveloped the two of them, and together they turned into a stream of light, flying out of the Ancient Land.

Yang Kai was now at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm, so his speed wasn’t slow, but compared to Luan Feng, he found himself lacking.

Unless he used his space powers to teleport, he simply couldn’t keep up with her.

In less than two days, the three of them left the Ancient Land and arrived at the entrance to the passage.

The passage was filled with strange mists, rampant lightning, and fierce winds, with countless Yin-Souls lurking about. Even someone at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm wouldn’t dare to rush in recklessly.

But for Luan Feng, these obstacles were nothing. She led Yang Kai straight into the swirling mists, and in just an hour, they emerged from the passage.

As his vision cleared, Yang Kai hadn’t even had time to take in the scenery ahead when he heard a surprised shout: “Brother Yang!”

“Hm?” Yang Kai was startled. Following the voice, he saw a large group of martial artists of varying strength—at least a hundred people.

Judging by their posture, it seemed they intended to enter the Ancient Land.

The speaker was a young man of about thirty, his face a bit pale, clearly injured.

Seeing this man, Yang Kai frowned and said, “Qi Hai?”

This was none other than Qi Hai from Qi Family Stronghold, whom Yang Kai had met years ago in the Shattered Star Sea. Qi Hai knew Yang Kai had obtained the True Phoenix Fire, so he had once begged Yang Kai to visit the Qi Family Stronghold and use the True Phoenix Fire to save his wife. She had been poisoned by the Heavenly Frost Earth Drizzle, one of the ten deadliest poisons, in the Wild Ancient Land. Only the Nirvana attribute of the True Phoenix Fire could dispel it.

If Yang Kai still possessed the True Phoenix Fire, he wouldn’t have minded helping within his ability.

But now, the True Phoenix Fire had been absorbed by Liu Yan, and Liu Yan had been taken to the Spirit Beast Island by Jiu Feng.

Yang Kai was powerless to help.

When Yang Kai entered the Ancient Land earlier, he had also encountered another disciple of the Qi Family Stronghold, Qi Hefeng, who had been stationed in the passage by Qi Hai to wait for him.

Qi Hefeng had wanted to do Yang Kai a favor by warning him that the Netherworld Sect was plotting against him, but Yang Kai, bold as ever, charged into the Ancient Land anyway.

The result was that the entire group from the Netherworld Sect was wiped out.

As their eyes met, Qi Hai’s expression was complicated, a mix of guilt and struggle flashing in his eyes. But soon, his hesitation turned to resolve. He cupped his fists and shouted to a burly old man ahead, “Senior Wu, that’s the man you’re looking for.”

The old man looked aged but was extremely robust, wearing a sleeveless vest. The muscles on his arms were like cast iron, and it seemed as if terrifying strength could erupt at any moment.

Hearing Qi Hai’s words, the burly old man’s face darkened. He growled, “So he’s that brat called Yang Kai?”

As he spoke, his hawk-like eyes stabbed straight at Yang Kai, his face brimming with murderous intent.

Qi Hai said in a low voice, “That’s right!”

“Good, very good!” The old man’s face twisted into a ferocious grin. “I didn’t expect that before I could go looking for him, he’d come right to me. What luck!”

Qi Hai gritted his teeth and said, “Senior Wu, please keep your promise. Once this is over, let me borrow the True Phoenix Fire.”

The old man snorted, “When did I ever make you that promise?”

“But Senior, you said before…” Qi Hai’s face changed dramatically, looking at the old man in distress.

The old man sneered, “The True Phoenix Fire is a divine object. How could you possibly borrow it?”

“Senior, you’re breaking your word!” Qi Hai’s face turned ashen. Though he was furious, he was powerless against someone so much stronger.

“Insolence!” This time, it wasn’t the old man but another elder who shouted angrily, striking Qi Hai with a palm that sent him flying, spitting blood, and crashing to the ground, his aura fading.

The elder stepped forward and said coldly, “If you dare speak nonsense again, I’ll kill you myself!”

“Young Stronghold Master!”

Seeing Qi Hai fall, a group of people rushed over to help him up. Realizing he wasn’t in mortal danger, they breathed a sigh of relief. But when they looked at the elder who struck him, their faces were full of resentment, though none dared speak out.

“What kind of show is this…” Yang Kai watched with a strange expression.

He hadn’t expected that just after leaving the Ancient Land, he’d stumble upon such a spectacle—and it seemed he was part of the show himself.

Qi Hai and the old man hadn’t said much, but Yang Kai wasn’t stupid. He could naturally glean a few things from their exchange.
