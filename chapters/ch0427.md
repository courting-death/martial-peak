## Chapter 427 — Snatching People

The command flag that should have originally belonged to Yang Kang was suddenly snatched away, causing the elated Yang Kang to freeze for a moment, his mood turning utterly sour in an instant.

Moreover, after the person who snatched the flag soared up and then darted down, the command flag had already vanished without a trace.

Gritting his teeth, he cursed angrily but dared not make any rash moves.

That immense Divine Sense power, reaching the pinnacle of the Divine Roaming Realm, still hung heavily in the air over this region.

Not only did Yang Kang dare not act rashly, but everyone present also refrained from any large movements.

A hidden powerhouse like this served as a great deterrent to all, though no one knew who he was. Everyone understood in their hearts that this expert was not one of their own.

Because of this Divine Sense’s intimidation, the Yang Tie and several martial artists from the Duanmu Family, who were initially in a precarious situation, now found themselves considerably relieved.

However, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians charged into the battlefield without any reservation, swinging a left strike and a right blow, targeting only those brought by Yang Kang. Though those from Yang Ying’s faction found these two unfamiliar, they did not investigate further and let Wind and Cloud rampage freely on the battlefield.

After a few moves, the two of them had already arrived before Yang Tie.

Seeing the unfavorable situation, Yang Kang could not help but shout, "What are you standing idly for? Quickly capture my Third Brother!"

The command flag was gone; if they failed to capture anyone, this would truly be a fruitless endeavor.

This shout finally stirred those who had been guarding closely into action.

Yang Ying also roared fiercely, "Stop them!"

The martial artists on both sides resumed their fierce battle, entangled and unable to separate.

With the assistance of several martial artists from Yang Ying’s faction amid the chaos, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians successfully pushed back two formidable figures from the Duanmu Family guarding Yang Tie and seized him firmly.

Yang Ying laughed loudly and called to Wind and Cloud, "Please bring him over!"

"Understood," Feng Wei responded in a deep voice.

"Hurry."

"Okay!"

As they spoke, Yang Tie was casually thrown forward.

Yang Ying was momentarily stunned, still trying to process what happened. The person who snatched the command flag earlier had suddenly leapt into the air to intercept Yang Tie, grabbing him and flying away.

At the same time, the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians also took to the sky, wrapped in a torrent of blue light as they vanished into the night.

"Fifth Brother, Seventh Brother, thank you!" A familiar voice called out from afar.

The faces of Yang Kang and Yang Ying instantly hardened, and they exclaimed, "Old Ninth!"

The crowd overheard this and exploded into uproar!

Old Ninth! He was the youngest scion among the Yang Family’s legitimate descendants — Yang Kai!

Earlier, when Yang Kang was speaking confidently, he had mentioned that tonight Yang Zhao and Yang Shen had already gone to cause trouble at Yang Kai’s residence. Judging by his performance that day, he didn't have much support to offer. Though his backing was somewhat better than Yang Tie’s, it was hardly significant.

Yet now, at this very moment, Old Ninth Yang Kai should have been overwhelmed in his manor. How did he appear here to reap the benefits of others’ struggles?

Moreover, it seemed he had come with only two aides.

This fellow was truly audacious!

For some reason, hearing Yang Kang’s sharp shout and his tone filled with disbelief stirred the crowd’s excitement and enthusiasm.

They seemed to think that this unexpected twist in the fight was the kind of spectacle worth witnessing.

In an instant, Yang Kai had already rushed far beyond a hundred zhang, his True Essence fully deployed, his figure flashing repeatedly with a long and continuous afterimage trailing behind him.

"As expected from the Young Master!" Tang Yuxian murmured with a smile. She had suspected from the golden light glimpsed in the dark moments ago that it might be the Golden Feather Eagle. Hearing Yang Kai’s voice now confirmed her suspicions.

"You knew from the start?" Yang Kang glanced at her displeased.

Tang Yuxian shook her head with a serious expression, "It’s only speculation, not certainty."

Yang Kang’s expression darkened, and he said nothing more. He knew Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian held Yang Kai in high regard. They had deliberately selected these two as escorts for this succession war because of their strength and to spite Yang Kai.

But unexpectedly, at this critical moment, it was they who were outwitted.

The command flag and the person had both been snatched by Yang Kai. Yang Kang and Yang Ying fought tooth and nail, losing so much support, yet gained nothing.

The frustration in his heart was hard to describe.

"Pursue!" Yang Kang gritted his teeth and shouted, soaring after them.

Yang Ying’s expression was also grim; he followed silently.

Both groups set off, leaving behind a shattered residence and four or five severely injured Duanmu Family experts.

Neither cared to deal with the Duanmu survivors. Their priority was to chase down Yang Kai and retrieve Yang Tie.

This first battle of the night unexpectedly ended with a classic case of a third party benefiting from two opponents’ struggle, much to everyone's surprise. The onlookers, holding onto the excitement, all hurried after them.

They were also quite curious about this audacious and rampaging Old Ninth Yang Kai, eager to know what kind of man the youngest Yang scion was to act with such impudence.

Faintly, many secretly hoped Yang Kai would not be caught.

With such a figure involved, the succession war would be far more interesting and thrilling.

Amidst the bloodied corpses, the few survivors from the Duanmu Family exchanged looks, smiling bitterly and slowly sat down to recuperate and regulate their Primordial Qi.

They had done their best.

This time, the Duanmu Family had brought thirty or forty people, but only five remained after the fight!

Though a loss in strength, it served to boost their reputation. When people later spoke of this succession war, they would praise the Duanmu Family for their loyalty and dedication, bravely guarding despite knowing their defeat was inevitable.

Such a family would surely gain allies in the future.

Thus, in the long run, the Duanmu Family not only suffered no loss but gained benefits.

Yang Kang and Yang Ying pursued Yang Kai with their forces. Initially, they could still see his shadow, but as time passed, even that vanished.

Numerous Divine Roaming Realm experts released their Divine Sense in an attempt to track Yang Kai’s movements, but these powers sank like a stone into the sea, utterly futile.

Yang Kai and Yang Tie had seemingly vanished into thin air.

The report from the pursuers only darkened the expressions of Yang Kang and Yang Ying further.

"Your Old Ninth’s speed is truly terrifying," Gao Rangfeng said in shock. Carrying a person, he managed to shake off even many Divine Roaming Realm experts without a trace—such speed was almost inconceivable.

"No matter his speed, how can he conceal his movements and Primordial Qi under so many Divine Roaming Realm experts’ Divine Senses?" Kang Zhan shook his head in disbelief.

Yang Ying's eyes flickered as she glanced at Tang Yuxian, smiling faintly. "Fifth Brother, I’ve heard your Blood Servant here has greater soul skills than most. Can’t her Divine Sense detect anything?"

Hearing this, Yang Kang also turned to Tang Yuxian with a questioning look.

Tang Yuxian shook her head gently. "I’ve tried. I can’t find any trace of the Young Master."

Yang Kang frowned and said solemnly, "Yuxian, I know you have a good relationship with Old Ninth, but don’t forget, this is a succession war, and you are a Blood Servant of the Yang Family Blood Servants Hall!"

"I understand all that," Tang Yuxian said seriously, "but Blood Servants always separate public and private matters. Since you earned the right to have Tu Feng and me as your escorts with your merits, we will fully support you until you fail!"

Hearing that, Yang Kang could not press her further. His expression softened somewhat, nodding. "I didn’t mean to accuse. If even you can’t track him, then Old Ninth must have some powerful help hiding his movements."

"You mean the owner of that Divine Sense earlier?" Yang Ying suddenly recalled the terrifying and strange Divine Sense force.

"Probably. With such a powerful ally, he could indeed accomplish this," Yang Kang murmured, brow tightly furrowed. "Strange, who would be this powerful helper for Old Ninth?"

In the succession war, various great forces participated. The Eight Great Families rarely deployed anyone beyond the Fifth Stage of Divine Roaming Realm.

Other first-rate forces generally did not involve peak Divine Roaming Realm experts. Such experts tended to be older and reluctant to meddle in the balance of the succession war, and those families could not afford to lose such high-caliber talents.

Thus, in first-rate forces, the highest-ranking experts deployed were usually at the Eighth Stage of Divine Roaming Realm. Of course, exceptions existed, and as the war intensified, peak Divine Roaming Realm experts could appear on the battlefield.

Second-rate forces seldom had Eighth Stage experts.

For example, in the Blood Battle Gang, only Hu Man, their leader, was an Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert—but as a leader, he didn’t involve himself directly. Fengyu Tower had no Eighth Stage experts. Its leader Xiao Ruohan only held the Seventh Stage.

Therefore, second-rate force experts were roughly at the Sixth or Seventh Stage Divine Roaming Realm, at most.

Third-rate forces had even fewer experts, their support much smaller compared to the top two ranks.

Deaths were common in the succession war. If too many powerful figures died, those forces would likely be ruined.

Hence, all forces sent only as many experts as they could afford to lose.

And so far, no scion possessed a peak Divine Roaming Realm expert.

If Yang Kai truly had such support, Yang Kang and Yang Ying would be deeply alarmed, with no thought left for anything else.

"Old Ninth really struck it rich this time!" Yang Ying shook his head bitterly.

Not only did he seize the command flag, now Yang Tie was also in his hands. With one man and one flag, he could exchange for many useful supplies from the family, even treasures and martial skill cultivation methods. These resources would arm his followers, making them stronger and stronger.

"He can hold on through the night; we’ll see then," Yang Kang snorted coldly. At this time, the battlefield over there should be in upheaval as well. Old Ninth left his manor himself, an extremely risky gamble. To Yang Kang, it seemed more loss than gain.
