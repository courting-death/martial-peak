## Chapter 2477 — The Problem with the Technique

“Cousin, don’t go! You’re already here, why are you in such a hurry to leave?” Yang Kai suddenly called out enthusiastically in the direction of Wu Mengchuan.

Wu Mengchuan staggered, nearly falling out of the sky.

He quickly wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and shouted angrily, “Who’s your cousin?”

Yang Kai said solemnly, “Cousin, you’re really too much. Running into your younger cousin here and pretending not to know me? I’ll tell your mother when I get back—watch out, she’ll beat you.”

Wu Mengchuan, fuming, said, “Brat, stop spouting nonsense!”

“He’s your cousin?” The young man in tight clothes looked at Yang Kai with a strange expression. “He doesn’t look like it at all.”

Yang Kai replied, “That’s just how he is!” As he spoke, he looked up at Wu Mengchuan and said, “Cousin, someone here wants to bully your younger cousin. Shouldn’t you stand up for me or something?”

Wu Mengchuan’s face darkened. “Brat, if you keep talking nonsense, don’t blame me for being rude!”

Yang Kai immediately shouted angrily, “Everyone wants to be rude to me! Am I really that easy to bully? Believe it or not, I’ll beat you so badly your own mother won’t recognize you!”

Seeing Yang Kai constantly bringing up his mother, Wu Mengchuan was so furious he was practically steaming. But with five Emperor Realm masters below, he didn’t dare act rashly. He just sneered, “If you’ve got guts, come over here and see who beats whom!”

“Just you wait!” Yang Kai called out, then immediately flew up. While still in midair, he unleashed a flurry of fist shadows at Wu Mengchuan.

“You’ve got guts, brat!” Wu Mengchuan roared in anger. Although he was wary of the five Emperor Realm masters below, that didn’t mean he was afraid of Yang Kai. Seeing Yang Kai attack without hesitation, he immediately fought back.

However, he couldn’t figure out what Yang Kai’s relationship was with the five below, so he didn’t dare go all out—he attacked while defending, using only half his strength.

In an instant, thunderous booms echoed through the air as the two exchanged blows, fighting with great enthusiasm. The scene looked lively, but in truth, neither was using their real skills.

All of a sudden, Yang Kai shot Wu Mengchuan a subtle glance, signaling him in secret.

Wu Mengchuan didn’t know what Yang Kai meant, but after living so many years, he was no fool. While trading blows with Yang Kai, he cooperated to quickly move the battlefield away.

In just a short while, the two had left the sight of the five Emperor Realm masters. Soon after, even their Divine Sense couldn’t detect them.

“Hmph!” Yao Si snorted coldly, his face indifferent as he turned and flew back to his original position.

Although Yang Kai had annoyed him earlier, now that Yang Kai was fighting someone else, it wasn’t convenient to chase after him. He could only ignore it.

Red Ghost looked in the direction Yang Kai disappeared and chuckled, “That brat found himself a good way out.”

The young man in tight clothes nodded. “That person was probably called over to help him, putting on an act so he could leave.”

Wuchang didn’t say anything, but clearly thought the same. No matter how tough Yang Kai acted just now, shouting and posturing, in the end he was just a Dao Origin Realm cultivator. If he really fought Yao Si, he’d have no chance of survival.

This outcome wasn’t so bad either. By fighting and retreating alongside that so-called “cousin,” even someone like Yao Si, proud of his status, couldn’t do much to him.

Still... such scheming was a bit contemptible.

Soon, the five Emperor Realm masters gathered here all dispersed. Strangely, in the days that followed, they really didn’t encounter any more drastic drops in Origin Power.

This made them even more certain that the previous anomaly was Yang Kai’s doing.

…

Countless li from the Origin Sea, on a shattered star, two figures stood in the sky, facing each other from a distance.

One was tall and burly, his gaze blazing like a hungry wolf spotting prey.

The other stood against the wind, robes fluttering, eyes bright as stars.

These two were none other than Wu Mengchuan and Yang Kai. They had retreated together from the Origin Sea, each harboring their own schemes, and arrived at this desolate star.

“I really didn’t expect you to reach the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm in such a short time!” Wu Mengchuan looked at Yang Kai in amazement, a bit excited. “The technique this Lord passed to you isn’t bad, right?”

He thought Yang Kai’s rapid progress was thanks to the Heaven Devouring Battle Art. After all, the Heaven Devouring Battle Art was truly heaven-defying—so long as one could withstand its backlash, increasing one’s cultivation was easy.

“I’m naturally gifted and brilliant. It has nothing to do with your crappy technique,” Yang Kai said with a curl of his lip.

Wu Mengchuan chuckled. “This Lord was your Sect Master, and even saved your life. Is this how you talk to me?”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “If I remember right, I was the one who saved your life.”

Wu Mengchuan said, “Let’s say that’s true. But you can’t deny this Lord passed you a divine technique, can you?”

Yang Kai’s face turned angry. “You’ve got the nerve to bring that up? I actually have a question about that crappy technique of yours.”

“What?” Wu Mengchuan raised his eyebrows.

“The technique you taught me—isn’t it incomplete?”

Wu Mengchuan’s eyes lit up and his breathing quickened. He exclaimed, “You really did cultivate the divine art!”

He looked like a lecher seeing a naked beauty, his eyes shining so much that Yang Kai got goosebumps.

Yang Kai said impatiently, “Whether I cultivated it or not, what’s it to you?”

Wu Mengchuan smiled slightly. “If you hadn’t cultivated it, how would you have noticed this problem?”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “So the technique really is incomplete. You’re despicable! Back then, I risked my life to get you out of the Bone Prison and set you free. Not only are you ungrateful, you even taught me an incomplete technique! Where’s your conscience? Where’s your sense of justice? Damn it, I was just too naive back then to trust a scoundrel like you!”

He cursed bitterly, pounding his chest in regret, looking as if he wished he could buy some medicine for regret.

Wu Mengchuan beamed with joy. When Yang Kai finished cursing, he said, “The technique this Lord passed to you isn’t incomplete—it’s the complete technique!”

“Bullshit!” Yang Kai spat at him.

Wu Mengchuan easily dodged, saying calmly, “Don’t be so rude, brat. Didn’t your elders teach you to respect your seniors?”

“Sorry, I was born this way!” Yang Kai said with a rebellious look.

Wu Mengchuan snorted, “This Lord won’t stoop to your level. But about that technique, do you want to hear this Lord’s explanation?”

“Spare me!” Yang Kai glared at him.

Wu Mengchuan didn’t mind and said blandly, “Back then, our ancestor created the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, became a Great Emperor, soared through the heavens and earth, unrivaled in the universe! Unfortunately, a tree that stands out in the forest is sure to be blown down. The other Great Emperors grew jealous and joined forces to kill him. Truly, heaven is blind to such genius.”

Yang Kai sneered, “That’s not the version I heard.”

Wu Mengchuan glared at him. “Are you going to listen or not? If not, this Lord won’t say another word.”

Yang Kai shrugged, zipped his lips, and gestured for him to continue.

Wu Mengchuan snorted unhappily, then continued, “When our ancestor created the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, he discovered a huge flaw. Can you guess what it was?”

Yang Kai pointed at his own mouth and made a few muffled sounds, refusing to speak.

Wu Mengchuan said helplessly, “Though the divine art is heaven-defying, it goes against the natural order and the way of humanity, so its backlash is extremely strong. Only those with great willpower can cultivate it and withstand the backlash. Otherwise, it won’t be long before they suffer Qi Deviation and burn to death.”

Yang Kai’s heart stirred—he knew Wu Mengchuan wasn’t lying.

After all, his Incarnation had mentioned this before. But since the Incarnation’s body was a Stone Puppet, it could naturally refine and expel all kinds of impurities, so the Heaven Devouring Battle Art’s flaw didn’t affect him much.

“Besides that, when the divine art is cultivated to a certain limit, a bottleneck appears. If you don’t break through, you’ll never advance!” Wu Mengchuan’s face grew solemn as he stared at Yang Kai. “And that bottleneck is the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. That’s why neither of us can break through to the Emperor Realm!”

Yang Kai thought to himself that his failure to break through had nothing to do with the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, but he was happy to listen—he figured Wu Mengchuan was about to reveal a solution.

This guy seemed convinced he had Yang Kai in his grasp, so he was now rambling on, eager to spill everything.

Sure enough, Wu Mengchuan said, “To solve this problem, our ancestor came up with a clever method: have another person cultivate the Heaven Devouring Battle Art. When that person reaches the bottleneck at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, devour them to break through and advance to the Emperor Realm!” His tone grew more and more excited, his face flushed. “Our ancestor was truly a peerless genius—none of us can compare!”

Yang Kai looked shocked. “So that means... when you taught me the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, your real goal was to devour me!”

Wu Mengchuan grinned, revealing sharp white fangs. “Of course. Did you really think, as a descendant of our ancestor, I’d pass on the divine art so easily?”

“Despicable! Shameless!” Yang Kai shouted.

Wu Mengchuan snorted coldly. “You’re not the only one I’ve taught. Over the past few centuries, I’ve found more than a hundred talented cultivators and passed the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to them. But only you managed to reach the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. As for the others... they’re all dead.”

He paused. “The divine art I passed to you isn’t incomplete—it’s just a copy.”

“A copy?” Yang Kai frowned.

“That’s right. The Heaven Devouring Battle Art our ancestor created has a main and a copy. I cultivate the main one, and what I passed to you all is the copy!”
