## Chapter 2023 — Ethereal Jade Disc

Early on the road, Yang Kai had already caught up to Lu Baichuan.

But he did not immediately appear to strike him down; instead, he silently trailed behind.

With Yang Kai's Divine Sense and aided by the Nothingness secret art, if he deliberately concealed himself even a Dao Origin Realm expert might not detect him, let alone the fleeing Lu Baichuan.

The reason he did not strike Lu Baichuan down was that Yang Kai had developed a certain interest in him.

Spatial Force was not easy to master; although Lu Baichuan could only condense his attack into the form of a single Spatial Needle, that alone showed he had some skill with Spatial Force.

So he decided to follow and take a look.

After sensing Lu Baichuan enter that secret chamber, Yang Kai hurried in as well, maintaining the Nothingness secret art and hiding to one side.

What he never expected happened: the moment he stepped into the chamber, his Nothingness secret art was actually nullified by a strange force, exposing his presence.

He clearly felt that the force originated from the pitch-black round jade suspended in midair.

"You... how did you get in?" Lu Baichuan, as if he had seen a ghost, roared at Yang Kai with a fierce tone.

Yang Kai withdrew his gaze from the pitch-black round jade, glanced at him, and smiled. "I followed you in, of course."

“Detestable! You truly mean to wipe me out?” Lu Baichuan’s voice shook with fear and indignation. “Young Brother, you and I are strangers—no past grudges, no recent enmity. Why press me so ruthlessly? Rather than force us both into a battle of mutual ruin, why not let the matter end here? I can allow you to leave unharmed.”

"Do I need your permission to leave?" Yang Kai sneered. "Besides, although I have no grudge with you, I promised the Zhang Family I would not let you live."

"You brat are too much! Do you really think I fear you? If so, then none of us will find it easy," Lu Baichuan declared; seeing Yang Kai unmoved, he understood words were useless and resolved to fight to the death.

As he spoke, his power ran wild; with blood-red eyes he lunged at Yang Kai. The Lei Feng Hammer was wielded again, lightning flashing along the hammer, the arcs of thunder battering the small chamber into a ruin.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said calmly, "Come out!"

Saying so, he waved his hand.

The snow-white Yao Worm Matriarch, bearing the Purple-Green Twin Swords, made a stunning entrance.

At Yang Kai's command the Yao Worm Matriarch swung its twin swords and met Lu Baichuan head-on.

Previously, with so many eyes around, Yang Kai had avoided revealing the Yao Worm Matriarch. In this sealed chamber, with only him and Lu Baichuan, there was no risk; with the Yao Worm Matriarch currently at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin, dealing with Lu Baichuan was effortless.

Feeling the aura radiating from the Yao Worm Matriarch, Lu Baichuan was startled and cried out, "An Eleventh-Tier demonic beast?"

Instantly his face went pale and his fighting spirit evaporated.

He was only Third Stage of the Void King Realm; even facing an ordinary Eleventh-Tier demonic beast he would flee, let alone this Yao Worm Matriarch, which was far from common and even wielded twin-sword Secret Treasures...

"Young Brother, I admit defeat, please spare my life!" Lu Baichuan immediately begged without dignity.

Yang Kai paid him no heed.

The Yao Worm Matriarch likewise ignored him; an icy, profound intent spread as the Purple-Green Twin Swords stirred with spectral light and struck at Lu Baichuan.

In an instant the secret chamber surged with wild, tumbling energy. Lu Baichuan screamed again and again, exhausted every means, yet still could not defend himself against the Yao Worm Matriarch. In no time he was hacked bloody from head to toe, wounds covering his entire body, suffering as though he had swallowed pure gall.

At that moment Yang Kai had already reached the pitch-black round jade and frowned as he surveyed it.

This thing was bizarre; when Yang Kai probed it with Divine Sense he could detect nothing—it was like throwing a stone into the sea and seeing no trace.

Moreover, it could actually nullify his Nothingness secret art; what strange ability did it possess?

After studying it for a while, Yang Kai reached out and, surprisingly, plucked the pitch-black round jade down with ease, channeling his power into it; yet as before it vanished with no feedback.

"Strange, very strange," Yang Kai shook his head.

"Young Brother, spare me! If you wish to know the use of that thing I will tell you everything, only spare my life!" Lu Baichuan was now pressed into a corner by the Yao Worm Matriarch, with nowhere to hide.

What made him resentful was that the chamber had been built by his Lu ancestors as an impregnable vault for treasures; even a Dao Origin Realm expert would need effort to break it, and he could not break out with his own abilities.

"Do you know what this thing is?" Yang Kai turned and asked him.

Lu Baichuan hurriedly replied, "I know a little!"

Yang Kai nodded. In the next moment his Divine Sense moved: the Yao Worm Matriarch froze, the Purple-Green Twin Swords hovered an inch from Lu Baichuan's brow, nearly cleaving him, and the cold sword qi whipped his hair.

Strands of hair floated down and sliced past Lu Baichuan's eyes, sending cold sweat across him.

"Speak—what is this? Why can it nullify my secret art?" Yang Kai toyed with the pitch-black round jade and asked leisurely.

Lu Baichuan swallowed and glanced weakly at the Yao Worm Matriarch standing before him; he could not comprehend how a mere Void King Realm man could command such a powerful demonic beast.

"Don't try any tricks, or I'll kill you outright," Yang Kai snorted when he saw Lu Baichuan's wavering expression.

Lu Baichuan gave a start and said sheepishly, "I, this old man, admit defeat—how could I dare harbor any schemes? It's just... if I can tell Young Brother a little of what I know, would you spare my life?"

"You still bargain with me?" Yang Kai laughed.

"I dare not," Lu Baichuan hurriedly waved his hands. "I simply do not want to die."

"No one wants to die," Yang Kai nodded. "All right, I'll spare you."

Lu Baichuan rejoiced and was about to speak, but Yang Kai said, "On one condition—you must satisfy me with the information you give!"

Lu Baichuan's face turned bitter and he said, "I, this old man, will tell everything I know."

"Good." Yang Kai nodded and summoned over a stone stool, then sat down nonchalantly. He raised the pitch-black round jade and asked, "What is this thing?"

Lu Baichuan answered, "Ethereal Jade Disc!"

"Ethereal Jade Disc?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, seeming to recall something. "Is it related to the Ethereal Crystal?"

Lu Baichuan hurriedly replied, "The Ethereal Jade Disc is a product formed at the core of an Ethereal Crystal mine; even ten thousand Ethereal Crystal mines might not yield a single Ethereal Jade Disc."

"A product of the Ethereal Crystal mine's core?" Yang Kai's expression stirred.

"Indeed. However... this doesn't seem to be a pure Ethereal Jade Disc; it appears to have been fused with other materials by some mighty expert and refined many times—already counting as a kind of Secret Treasure," Lu Baichuan explained further.

"Oh? You know quite a lot," Yang Kai looked at him with some surprise.

"Young Brother flatters me. I have studied it over the years and read many texts, hence my conjecture." Lu Baichuan smiled awkwardly, his expression shifting before he hesitated: "May I ask, Young Brother, do you cultivate Spatial Force?"

"Don't you as well?" Yang Kai asked with a sly glint in his eye.

Lu Baichuan smiled bitterly. "My Spatial Force cannot compare to yours. When you once pinched off my Spatial Needle with a finger, I suspected it, and now it seems I was right. If you had not cultivated Spatial Force, you could not have received my Spatial Needle like that."

"Trifling skill," Yang Kai scoffed.

"Yes yes, my dim light cannot compare to your bright moon," Lu Baichuan said humbly.

"Stop flattering me. Tell me how you cultivated Spatial Force—does it have something to do with this Ethereal Jade Disc?" Yang Kai continued.

"Young Brother's eyes are keen." Lu Baichuan nodded. "I learned some Spatial Force from studying this Ethereal Jade Disc."

Hearing that, Yang Kai's doubts vanished.

When his Nothingness had been nullified by the Ethereal Jade Disc, he had already suspected it was related to Spatial Force. That Lu Baichuan understood Spatial Force confirmed the link.

"As I said, this Ethereal Jade Disc seems to have been refined by a great expert into a peculiar Secret Treasure, but I could not release its full might. Yet I inadvertently gleaned a bit of the method for cultivating Spatial Force from it, so..." Lu Baichuan explained while watching Yang Kai's expression.

But Yang Kai's face was unreadable, giving him no clue to the other's thoughts, which vexed Lu Baichuan.

"Cultivating Spatial Force is extremely arduous; without genuine aptitude no amount of pondering over millennia will open the gate. I'm curious—what opportunity did you have to unintentionally grasp the cultivation way from it?" Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and said coldly, "If you lie, I'll make sure you can neither live nor die."

Lu Baichuan shuddered and quickly said, "Young Brother, I would not dare lie. Since you wish to know, I will tell all. I indeed for special reasons managed to glean the Spatial Force method. This matter is long to tell; in truth this thing originally did not belong to our Lu Family but to the Zhang Family."

"Then how did it end up in your Lu Family? Did you seize it or steal it?" Yang Kai scoffed.

Lu Baichuan replied, "Young Brother, you wrong me—the thing was brought as part of the bride's dowry when a Zhang Family woman married into the Lu Family over two hundred years ago. You know the Lu and Zhang families have centuries of ties; marriages between them are common..."

"What does that have to do with your opportunity?" Yang Kai said, puzzled.

"Young Brother, be patient and listen," Lu Baichuan said composedly. Seeing Yang Kai's cold gaze, he dared not delay and continued to explain.
