## Chapter 1160 — Dragon-Slaying Whip

The man and woman’s status within Yingyue Hall was plainly high—otherwise they would not be sitting beside Qian Tong.

The other young disciples standing nearby, when they glanced at the two of them, all showed faint hints of envy.

"Elder Qian, you and Steward Yan are on good terms—do you know what this finale item actually is?" A female disciple standing nearby asked curiously.

Qian Tong's expression turned grave, as if he hadn't heard the girl's words. Seeing him like this, everyone held their breath; they felt even more strongly that the finale item was extraordinary—surely the elder knew some inside information, otherwise he wouldn't look so solemn.

"Luo Qing!" Qian Tong suddenly called out.

"Present." Luo Qing, who had been standing to the side, hurried forward.

"How many Saint Crystals did you gather?"

Luo Qing answered respectfully, "I followed the elder's orders and finally gathered fifty million Saint Crystals, though a large portion was transferred from the Sect."

"Fifty million…" Qian Tong's eyes narrowed. "I still have nearly thirty million here; together we've got about eighty million Saint Crystals…"

In the private room most people were shaken; even those born of Yingyue Hall and holding high positions within the Sect were astonished by the sum of eighty million Saint Crystals.

What shocked them even more was that Qian Tong actually muttered to himself, "I don't know if it's enough!"

The fair-faced woman sitting beside Qian Tong finally couldn't help but ask, "Master, what exactly is this finale item—can it really not be won even with eighty million?"

She was not the only curious one. Even another stalwart man, whose expression had been unchanged, grew curious and turned to Qian Tong, hoping he could explain a little.

Since the auction began, the priciest item so far had been the Exquisite Twin Forks sold earlier for only two million one hundred thousand Saint Crystals—could the finale possibly be a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure?

If it truly were a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure, eighty million might indeed be insufficient—but where could Jubao Tower have found such a thing?

"You youngsters don't understand!" Qian Tong smiled wryly. "Eighty million sounds like a lot, but others may have far more. Yingyue Hall is indeed a major force on Dark Star, but compared with Leitai Sect, Star Emperor Gate, and Battle Sky Alliance we're lacking; even Liuli Gate, Li Fire Cult, Twin-Heart Valley, and Piaomiao Hall are stronger than us. I'm afraid they'll have gathered more Saint Crystals."

"Master, what is that thing?" the fair-faced woman asked once more.

"See for yourselves." Qian Tong had no mood to answer. Even if he explained, these juniors might not recognize its value—let them start fighting first and they'll understand more easily afterwards.

No one in the private room spoke further; all eyes turned to the auction stage.

Yan Pei, his face dark, stood there and scanned the crowd with both eyes. He declared in a loud voice, "I am Yan Pei—thank you all for coming to Jubao Tower's auction. So far the auction has been satisfactory overall. The only thing I am displeased with is that you have all been holding your wallets too tightly. I hope you will display the grandeur and boldness of a great Sect—there's no need to spare face for others, nor to spare face for my Jubao Tower. If you want something, even if it bankrupts you, what does it matter? As long as you win it."

Yan Pei's blunt words made the experts in the private rooms gasp.

That dark-faced old man had malicious intent; from his tone it seemed he meant to drive them to ruin before he'd be satisfied. It was vicious—many people even thought of leaving immediately, lest they truly be ruined.

Yan Pei gave them no chance and continued, "Enough talk—now let me introduce the finale item of this auction!"

He waved his big hand and a palace-dressed girl appeared carrying a jade plate; the plate was covered with a red cloth, making everyone strain to see yet unable to make out what lay beneath, which only made them itch with impatience.

The palace girl stood before Yan Pei and froze; Yan Pei cried out, "Everyone, widen your eyes and look carefully…"

Saying so, he snatched the red cloth away. On the jade plate lay a crimson long whip. Its segments flowed smoothly like a scorpion's tail, tightly linked without seams; the tip was like a sharp spike that flashed with a jade-green light—clearly the spike's poison was exceptionally lethal.

"Dragon-Slaying Whip!" Yan Pei shouted.

In private room C-13, Yang Kai had just taken a sip of tea—he nearly spat it out when he heard the name Yan Pei gave the crimson whip.

The previous Exquisite Twin Forks' name was passable—neither bad nor wonderful, just middling.

But to call this crimson long whip the Dragon-Slaying Whip was utterly audacious; that old dark-faced man had a thick enough skin to dare give it such a name.

Scorching gazes came from all directions and countless Divine Senses swept over it; murmurs rose within the hall and the private rooms.

Yan Pei intoned gravely, "This is a genuine Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure. Our Jubao Tower's discerning masters have authenticated it. The main material of the whip is the tail of a Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast—the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion—reinforced with numerous Origin-Grade ores. Origin-Grade Middle-Level needs no elaboration; you all understand. This already surpasses the forging standards of Dark Star—no forger on Dark Star could craft it. The whip is two zhang and one chi long; by channeling Saint Yuan it can change length at will, responding like an extension of one's arm. Most rare of all, the master who forged this Dragon-Slaying Whip perfectly preserved the venom at the scorpion's tail tip. Though somewhat sinister, it greatly amplifies the whip's power."

As he spoke, Yan Pei lifted the Dragon-Slaying Whip from the jade plate and swung it on the high platform, sending out streaks of whip-shadow so that everyone might witness the might of an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure!

Sure enough, upon seeing the whip's power countless people breathed more rapidly.

After demonstrating it, Yan Pei placed the Dragon-Slaying Whip back on the plate.

At that moment, someone in one of the A-Class private rooms shouted, "Steward Yan, this is the thing you said would bankrupt us? An Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure is rare, but it won't break our families. I thought Jubao Tower had gathered a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure this time."

"Indeed—indeed. After making us so anxious, it's only an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure."

Yan Pei stood there as if he had not heard, a faint cold smile at the corner of his mouth.

The private rooms had received advance notice to gather Saint Crystals, yet no one knew what precious item Jubao Tower would actually present—this was confidential. Yan Pei wasn't about to spread the news, and he trusted that the shrewd Qian Tong would not leak anything either.

Each household had collected a huge sum of Saint Crystals. Now that there was only a single Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure on offer, people naturally felt disappointed and a bit embarrassed at having made such a fuss.

Still, they would fight for this treasure. Given its Origin-Grade Middle-Level rank, even if one failed to win it, one could at least push the price up and make others miserable.

For a time everyone waited with the mentality of harming others without benefiting themselves.

Yan Pei then uttered a line that made people's faces turn sour: "This Secret Treasure is most suitable for women. Even if you cannot use it yourself, buy it and give it to the woman you fancy. I guarantee the man who purchases this will surely win the beauty's favor."

"How disrespectful!" Yin Sudie in Liuli Gate's private room ground her teeth and cursed under her breath.

She had refrained from bidding on the Exquisite Twin Forks earlier to see if something better would appear. Sure enough, the Dragon-Slaying Whip had surfaced and she was determined to snatch it. She believed that with her popularity, once she bid many would bow out—she hadn't expected Yan Pei to say that; it merely invited more competitors.

The middle-aged woman beside Yin Sudie gently patted her hand and soothed, "Don't worry—we will win it."

"Thanks, Second Matron!" Yin Sudie smiled sweetly.

"Dragon-Slaying Whip—starting price one million. Each raise must be at least one hundred thousand. Place your bids!" Yan Pei had said all that needed saying; the moment had come to watch the bloodletting.

This was his favorite part; whenever others fought he felt thoroughly pleased, as if he had grown many years younger.

No sooner had his words fallen than bidding shouts erupted from the private rooms.

"One million one hundred thousand!"

"One million three hundred thousand!"

"One million five hundred thousand!"

"Two million!"

"..."

The very experts who had belittled the Dragon-Slaying Whip moments before seemed to have forgotten their remarks; eyes red, they scrambled to snatch it. Among the bidders were prominent Lords from the major forces of the Star as well as some rising talents.

"I'll offer two million one hundred thousand!" Qu Changfeng of Battle Sky Alliance always bid with an air of effortless superiority, as if his offer should cause others to yield.

"Hmph! Two million three hundred thousand!" Fang Tianzhong of Leitai Sect countered. Their respective forces were among Dark Star's top powers, and their reputations and strengths were nearly equal; neither feared the other.

"Fang brother, why would you buy this Dragon-Slaying Whip? It doesn't suit you—wouldn't that be a waste of money?" Qu Changfeng chuckled and nonchalantly raised the bid, "Two million five hundred thousand!"

“I can’t use it, but you can? Two million eight hundred thousand!” Fang Tianzhong refused to back down.

“I’m buying it as a gift, of course. I heard Junior Sister Yin of Liuli Gate lacks a fitting Secret Treasure—so I’ll just offer flowers to the Buddha with someone else’s bloom. Three million!”

It was an open declaration of affection, made in front of all Dark Star's major powers—instantly drawing a chorus of scoffs.

In Liuli Gate's private room the middle-aged woman's face turned cold and Yin Sudie's expression was displeased; she did not want any rumors to spread from today's affair. She replied softly, "Senior Brother Qu, your kindness is appreciated, but if I want the Dragon-Slaying Whip I'll bid myself—three million two hundred thousand!"
