## Chapter 1942 — You Are Unlucky

"Shit!" Yang Kai couldn't help but curse; his mood was foul.

Ever since entering the Starlight Passage, every person he had encountered seemed to be disagreeable.

First he ran into Yin Lesheng, who attacked him and his companions for no reason; then that Senior Brother Kou showed up and, again without cause, had him dragged into the Biyu Sect and thrown into the Bone Prison. Before its gates he met Yan Xiuran, who tried to snatch his Secret Treasures out of nowhere; and then there was this iron tower of a man...

Yang Kai suddenly realized that in the short time he'd spent in the Star Realm, he'd encountered nothing but unpleasant memories.

Were the people of the Star Realm all so brutal and quarrelsome? Or was his fortune simply rotten?

Whatever the cause, Yang Kai was growing intolerant.

Repeated encounters had made the fury in his heart surge like a volcano about to erupt.

The provocations and shameless boasts of this Zong Qi were clearly a fuse, one that thoroughly detonated the anger inside Yang Kai.

So when he heard Zong Qi's threats, Yang Kai was not afraid; instead he asked with amusement, "From the sound of your words, killing people in this place seems to be of no consequence?"

Zong Qi sneered, "This is the Biyu Sect's Bone Prison; what's a handful of deaths to us?"

"Understood." Yang Kai nodded lightly, then suddenly looked up and grinned, baring his white, feral teeth; in a cold voice he said, "Then you're out of luck!"

No sooner had the words fallen than he surged forward to Zong Qi, his footing shifting as he assumed a close‑quarters fighting stance, launching a straight punch forward.

That punch seemed to carry all the dissatisfaction and fury Yang Kai had accumulated recently; its momentum roared like a rainbow, swift as a thunderbolt.

Zong Qi was a hulking, broad‑shouldered man whose mastery of the Body Refining Technique was profound; he didn't even regard Yang Kai's attack as worth noting, only sneering, "How amusing — someone dares to provoke me like this? I'll crush every bone in your body as punishment!"

As he spoke, he also threw a straight punch to meet Yang Kai's strike.

The two fists met; the cold ferocity at the corner of Yang Kai's mouth twisted into a grimace, and Zong Qi's disdain suddenly turned to astonishment, then to horror...

With a shriek, Zong Qi's tower‑like body was hurled backward, and in midair a crisp sound of bones breaking rang from his arm.

Thud...

Zong Qi's body slammed into the bone bars of the Bone Prison and fell heavily to the ground.

Before he could even rise, Yang Kai pounced like a tiger, straddled him, and his fists became a storm of blows raining down like a deluge.

Bang, bang, bang...

Within the little Bone Prison, a continuous barrage of impacts sounded like war drums, shaking everyone to the core.

The three who had originally come to watch the show were now stunned, their eyes wide as they stared in shock at the scene not far away.

Liu Qianyun stood there dumbfounded as well; her heart trembled with fear yet also felt a spark of elation.

After all, in a place like this, the more domineering Yang Kai appeared, the safer she would be — in any case she now counted herself an ally on the same side as Yang Kai!

From other cells came shouts and cries; the warriors imprisoned here had been tormented for years and their ferocity was honed to the bone — they most enjoyed bloody fights like this, a pastime to dispel boredom.

Bang, bang, bang...

The dull thuds continued, and the occasional splash of dark red blood flew about, sometimes accompanied by the sound of bones shattering.

The commotion in the cell alerted the guards, and soon two Biyu Sect disciples came to investigate; upon discovering that it was this newly imprisoned fellow Yang Kai making a show of force, they only coldly smiled and showed no intention of stopping it, lingering to watch for a while before departing.

Zong Qi had been right — in the Biyu Sect's Bone Prison, a few deaths hardly mattered — so the Biyu Sect guards had no intention of intervening.

As time passed, the man pinned beneath Yang Kai, Zong Qi, first howled in pain and cursed loudly, then quickly ran out of strength to curse; only moans and pleas remained.

Yang Kai attacked like a crazed beast and paid no heed.

In the end, Zong Qi no longer even moaned.

When Yang Kai finally withdrew his hands and rose, Zong Qi lay there as a lump of mangled flesh — bloodied, every bone shattered, dead beyond any hope of revival.

Yang Kai shook the blood from his hands, took a deep breath, and immediately felt invigorated; the depression that had weighed on his heart dissipated in an instant.

The other three in the cell stepped back to the corner in terror when Yang Kai rose, their gazes trembling as they looked at him, afraid he might slaughter them all.

They knew Zong Qi's ability well; with everyone's strength suppressed in the Bone Prison, the one with the strongest body held the advantage — the three had suffered under Zong Qi, and even together they were no match for him.

Yet this newcomer had beaten Zong Qi to utter helplessness, smashing him to pieces — it was plain to see how fearsome his physical body must be!

They had every reason to be afraid.

Fortunately Yang Kai showed no intention of attacking further; he walked to the corner and sat down cross‑legged, which made the three involuntarily exhale in relief, feeling as if they had narrowly escaped death.

Liu Qianyun was sensible enough not to disturb him; knowing his mood was volatile, she simply sat down cross‑legged nearby to recuperate.

After an unknown span of time, the cell door was suddenly opened.

The two Biyu Sect guards who had come earlier stood at the doorway with cold faces and waved at Yang Kai, "You brat, get out here!"

Yang Kai glanced at them and rose slowly.

Liu Qianyun tugged at his clothes from behind, her face full of worry.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, "Don't worry — I'll be back soon; they won't dare kill me."

As long as that Protector Bian hadn't given an order on how to deal with him, the Biyu Sect wouldn't act recklessly; for that alone Yang Kai felt he ought to owe Protector Bian a measure of gratitude.

After speaking he turned and cast a look at the other three men in the cell, sneering, "If you don't want to die, don't move. If I find my companion harmed when I return, you know what will happen."

The three men, already cowed by Yang Kai's ferocity and with Zong Qi's corpse still on the ground, dared not speak and nodded their heads like pecking chicks.

"Dawdling here is courting death! Get out here at once!" the guard at the doorway urged impatiently.

Yang Kai curled his lips and strode out.

Outside, the two guards sized Yang Kai up and one sneered, "I heard you gave Senior Brother Yan a nasty surprise?"

"You're something else, kid — on your very first day here you took Zong Qi out. He's not someone to be messed with; for that alone we Senior Brothers have to admit we're impressed with you."

"But Senior Brother Yan said to treat you properly. Don't blame anyone — blame yourself for being blind and offending someone you shouldn't have."

The two spoke back and forth, and Yang Kai quickly grasped the situation.

He said little, merely motioning for them to lead the way.

The two guards glanced at each other and couldn't help but flash a thumbs‑up at Yang Kai, grinning with meaning, "You got nerve!"

Soon Yang Kai was taken to a dim interrogation chamber where he was bound and subjected to various tortures by those two Biyu Sect disciples.

Only half a day later was Yang Kai, near death, thrown back into the cell.

Seeing Yang Kai's miserable state, Liu Qianyun nearly fainted with fright — she feared he would die soon, and if he died she would be left isolated and helpless; in such a place the fate that awaited her needed no imagination.

What surprised her beyond measure was that the man who had seemed near death sat cross‑legged and began to meditate an hour later, assuming a posture to circulate his energy.

By the next day Yang Kai was vigorous and fierce once more; though he appeared somewhat disheveled, his injuries seemed not serious — even the scars on his body had vanished, his skin newly revealed as the clotted blood flaked off.

Liu Qianyun found herself increasingly unable to read Yang Kai; she instinctively sensed he hid secrets beyond imagination...

The following days went on in the same pattern.

Each day Yang Kai endured the tortures administered by those two Biyu Sect guards, was thrown back to the cell half dead, then sat and recovered — the cycle repeated.

As time passed, Liu Qianyun was startled to find Yang Kai himself seemed to be changing, growing ever stronger; within his suppressed body there stirred a tremendous, unfathomable force that, once the restraints were lifted, would undoubtedly erupt forth.

In fact, that was exactly what happened!

The tortures of the two Biyu Sect guards caused the starlight Yang Kai had absorbed in the Starlight Passage to fuse rapidly into his flesh, prompting his Saint Yuan to transform toward Origin Qi.

He had absorbed an unimaginable amount of starlight in the Starlight Passage; some had been assimilated as a catalyst to convert his internal strength, but the vast majority had been hidden in his Sea of Consciousness.

That was also why, though he was a Star Lord, he bore no visible starlight.

Under normal circumstances Yang Kai could have drawn the starlight from his Sea of Consciousness to fuse into his body and promote his power's conversion.

But now his force was sealed and he could not guide it out.

Instead, the tortures by the two Biyu Sect guards gave him a glimmer of hope.

As his body was broken and repaired, the starry power surged from his Sea of Consciousness into his flesh, forcibly converting his Saint Yuan into Origin Qi!

Discovering this, Yang Kai could not help but be overjoyed.

Thus when facing those two guards' torment, he did not find it unbearable; he welcomed it like sweet nectar, even hoping they would break him more horribly.
