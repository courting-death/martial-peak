## Chapter 805 — Change Of Attitude

Yang Kai disliked being pushed around; his destiny would always be something he gripped with his own hands.

That was why he had long resisted and recoiled at the notion of inheriting the Lordship of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land — it was not what he wanted. No matter how friendly the people of the Sacred Land appeared toward him, their goodwill was tinged with ulterior motives.

Yet when he learned that Xia Ningshang and Meng Wuya had come here and set up certain measures in the Yingyue Pool, Yang Kai found his resistance to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land inexplicably softened.

Preserving the power of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land might mean that one day he could meet his little senior sister there again.

He had already located Su Yan — she remained at the Ice Sect, diligently cultivating. He was not worried about Di Mo; that old demon was no pushover. What he constantly fretted over, however, was the whereabouts of his little senior sister.

Now that there was finally a concrete hope to cling to, Yang Kai naturally did not want that hope dashed by foreign invaders.

So he took the initiative and proposed the idea to Xu Hui.

Xu Hui soon returned word, matching Yang Kai’s expectations: once it was known that Yang Kai could securely resettle the Sacred Land disciples, the elders and protectors all expressed willingness to temporarily evacuate and conserve their strength to await a future comeback and vengeance.

But when repeatedly questioned about where he could house six or seven thousand disciples, Yang Kai was unwilling to answer immediately. It was only when An Ling'er stepped forward to persuade them that they relented.

"If you've decided to do this, then tell me about that Great Yao Lord," Yang Kai said in the main hall, staring at the elders and protectors. "The more details the better."

Since arriving on this continent he had only dealt with one yao.

The Enchantress.

That seductive yao woman who used Divine Sense toxins to awaken desire in people's hearts. So he knew little of the yao; meeting a Great Yao Lord now meant he had to prepare.

"We've never met that Great Yao Lord ourselves, but the old Sacred Lord mentioned him," one elder said. "He is originally an Eighth-Tier demonic beast, the Red Flame Thunder Dragon, born with the ability to cultivate two elemental attributes. His cultivation is not weak, and his divine prowess is formidable."

"An Eighth-Tier demonic beast…" Yang Kai frowned, silently calculating. Sixth-Tier equaled the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh-Tier the Transcendent Realm, so Eighth-Tier was indeed into the Saint Realm.

In other words, that Great Yao Lord was a Saint Realm powerhouse, at least Second Stage of the Saint Realm, and very likely Third Stage.

"Around him there are several subordinates who themselves are Eighth-Tier demonic beasts, though none match his strength. There are also many Seventh- and Sixth-Tier ones, but few have taken human form — perhaps only twenty-odd."

"Those twenty-odd are all Transcendent Realm, meaning Seventh-Tier and above…"

"They possess innate combat instinct. Although they haven't trained any Martial Skills, their fighting capability is not to be underestimated."

"But they don't understand formation arrays, so their settlements lack dense Spiritual Qi and rely purely on natural generation."

The assembly chatted loudly, laying out every scrap of intelligence they had.

Yang Kai listened closely, and when they finished he asked with curiosity, "The hatred between humans and yao runs deep. How did your old Sacred Lord become acquainted with that Great Yao Lord?"

Xu Hui chuckled. "The yao have little in the way of crystal stones, but they abound in Spiritual Herbs and medicines. Once, when the old Sacred Lord went out, he apparently met that Great Yao Lord and they fought for a time. Somehow they developed a mutual respect and decided to trade what each had. So from time to time the old Sacred Lord would take many crystal stones over and exchange them for vast amounts of Spiritual Herbs and medicines, and rare five-element metals. They aren't skilled at pill-refinement or artifact forging, so secret treasures and pills often came from the old Sacred Lord."

"I see…" Yang Kai nodded slightly. "So if that Great Yao Lord still felt some old sentiment, my visit this time shouldn't be too dangerous… Indeed, he must still remember old ties."

"What makes you say that?" Xu Hui asked in astonishment.

"The old Sacred Lord fell nearly two years ago. The yao must have learned of it long ago, yet they did not act. Clearly the Great Yao Lord did not wish to strike the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; otherwise your situation would have only worsened."

Hearing Yang Kai's words, the gathered elders fell silent in thought, then nodded in agreement.

"I heard the yao have something called a Huasheng Pool?" Yang Kai suddenly asked.

"Yes." Xu Hui nodded. "The Huasheng Pool is the yao's root. No one knows how it forms. Wherever a Huasheng Pool exists, yao gather. Once a demonic beast reaches Seventh-Tier it qualifies to enter the Huasheng Pool; if fortune and opportunity are sufficient it may transform into human form; otherwise it will forever remain in beast form."

"So it's that miraculous?" Yang Kai's interest was piqued; he could not help but want to see it for himself.

Xu Hui shook his head. "Not every beast that enters succeeds. I've heard many fail. Even those who take human form often prefer their true beast bodies and continue appearing as beasts. So the yao population likely exceeds twenty Transcendent Realm individuals; that figure may be double."

"That's truly impressive power!" Yang Kai exclaimed.

Across the Nine Heavens Sacred Land there are roughly that many Transcendent Realm cultivators; the yao's strength could essentially match the Sacred Land at its peak.

"Get some crystal stones ready first," Yang Kai instructed. "For a first meeting, as juniors we should naturally prepare some gifts; otherwise we might not even be granted an audience with that Great Yao Lord."

"Right, I'll arrange it now," Xu Hui agreed and left at once.

An hour later, everything was ready. Yang Kai carried two Spatial Pouches full of crystal stones and, following directions from the others, flew out from the Nine Peaks.

The protectors and elders watched him go, their faces full of puzzlement.

"Elder, I feel the new Sacred Lord's attitude has suddenly changed a lot," Shi Kun frowned and said.

"Yes, he’s suddenly enthusiastic about the Sacred Land's affairs. He was very indifferent before, like it wasn't his concern," Cheng Yuetong remarked, her brows knitting.

"I don't know," Xu Hui replied, shaking his head. "But that's a good thing. His sudden zeal today might mean he will accept the succession in the future."

"Perhaps it has something to do with the Yingyue Pool incident," An Ling'er murmured.

"Oh? Why do you say that?"

"Just a guess," An Ling'er smiled slightly, unable to explain why.

"But can we trust him? He says he has a place to house so many Sacred Land disciples, and now he intends to meet a Great Yao Lord. Truly, he has confused me!" Yu Ying fretted.

"Weren't you all planning on fighting them to the death anyway? If he succeeds there may be a chance; if he fails you can proceed as planned. So whether you trust him or not changes little."

"That's true." Yu Ying pursed her lips and felt somewhat relieved.

"But… I believe him," An Ling'er's expression suddenly turned solemn. "This man always finds a way out of desperate situations and turns danger into safety. I think he can do it this time too."

"If that's the case, once things are settled, regardless of whether he accepts the title, I will still honor him as Sacred Lord!" Xu Hui declared in a low voice.

"What the elder says is right." The others nodded, their eyes shining with expectation.

……

Yang Kai had barely flown clear of the Nine Peaks when he sensed he was being tailed.

Poxuan Palace, War Soul Hall, and the Netherworld Sect had all corrupted and rallied many experts; half a month ago they had attacked the Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Though driven back, they had not gone far and were likely nearby, watching and waiting for the right moment.

Anyone who left the Nine Peaks would surely fall into their sight.

Yang Kai was not alarmed; by probing with his divine awareness he quickly discerned the cultivational ranks of those tailing him.

One was First Stage of the Transcendent Realm, and a dozen or so were Divine Roaming Realm!

Such numbers were hardly worth Yang Kai's concern.

After trailing through the mountains for an hour, they lost Yang Kai's trail.

The leading Transcendent Realm expert stopped, raised a hand to signal the Divine Roaming Realm cultivators to halt, and carefully searched, but could not detect Yang Kai's location.

"Senior, where did that brat go?" a square-faced youth in the group asked suspiciously.

The Transcendent Realm expert slowly shook his head, his face grave. "This brat is odd. Let's return."

"He looks young, his strength can't be that high, right?" the youth sneered, thinking the elder overly cautious.

"You know nothing. Do you think every young person is as mediocre as you? Though he looks younger than you, being able to slip from my tracking means his cultivation won't be weak. Perhaps… he's already discovered us and set a trap ahead."

The youth was scolded into silence, slightly resentful. He snorted, "I don't think he's that impressive."

The Transcendent Realm cultivator sneered without further words and started to leave. "If you think you're stronger, go catch him. I'll see if you return alive."

With that he turned and walked off.

These followers did not belong to a single faction; many forces had sent men to watch the Sacred Land, so the group was a mixed lot. After the youth was rebuked he was not pleased, but seeing the elder leave, he lacked the courage to pursue alone and followed in sullen silence.

Just then the leading First Stage Transcendent Realm expert halted again; his face suddenly turned horrified, his body trembling, eyes staring as if he had seen an unspeakably dreadful sight.

"What now?" the previously scolded youth mumbled, following the elder's gaze and instantly standing dumbfounded.
