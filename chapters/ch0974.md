## Chapter 974 — Blood Pool Flesh Forest

The sea of blood stretched without bound, veiling heaven and earth.

In an instant, everyone’s hearts dropped to the bottom of a valley; wherever their eyes fell, there was nothing but a spreading crimson. Blood surrounded them on every side, thick and viscous, hampering movement.

Strange forces arose from that blood, disrupting the flow of power within the bodies of those present.

The thirteen of them felt as if they had fallen into a vast blood pool with no way out, unable to see any light.

At that moment all of them brought forth defensive secret treasures, guarding their bodies while remaining on alert and searching for an escape.

Ke Luo was nowhere to be seen, yet his aura permeated the blood sea in every direction.

It was as if he were everywhere at once!

The Bone Race’s forbidden art: the Blood Pool Flesh Forest.

Within that viscous sea of blood, blood dragons bizarrely formed and swam freely through the waters, exuding an overwhelmingly dangerous aura. They were clearly controlled by Ke Luo, yet he did not hurry to strike—he seemed intent on savoring the sight of them struggling.

Yang Kai stood shoulder to shoulder with Han Fei; the ice-cold power within Han Fei surged uncontrollably, but it could not freeze this blood. The frigid force was suppressed within her, unable to fully erupt.

Yang Kai produced a Blood Essence Stone and poured True Yuan into it, attempting to use this foreign oddity to draw away the surrounding blood.

But he was disappointed.

The Blood Essence Stone had no effect here; soaked in the blood, it could not siphon even a drop.

This discovery filled him with dread.

Having used Blood Essence Stones so many times before, he knew they could only extract the blood of the dead; they could not draw blood from the living.

Even if a living person were grievously wounded, blood could not be sucked from the wound because the living can circulate power to resist the stone’s pull.

Ke Luo was not dead, so naturally the Blood Essence Stone would not work.

Moreover, this entire Blood Pool Flesh Forest must have been generated by his explosive power, Yang Kai suddenly realized. That was why his aura was everywhere.

“You seem to have discovered something?” Ke Luo’s voice rang in Yang Kai’s ear as he laughed: “Indeed, you are now inside my body. Here, I am the master; if I want you to live, you live; if I want you to die, you die—no one can resist!”

As if to prove his words, the arrogant tone had barely fallen when a sharp cry suddenly rang out.

“Yu’er……” Lei Long the Great Lord cried out anxiously.

That voice had obviously been the shout of the yao Great Lord’s Ice-Jade Python; she must have been beset by some attack.

“I’m all right!” Yu’er’s voice answered from a certain direction, and Lei Long darted toward it. But when he followed the sound, he could not find the Ice-Jade Python’s trace.

Within this sea of blood, even direction could not be trusted.

The thirteen were split apart; except for Yang Kai and Han Fei standing together, the other eleven were all separated, each forced to defend alone.

The situation was as dire as it could be.

Yang Kai’s thoughts spun as he searched for a way out of the predicament, but he found himself powerless.

“Your auras resemble that man from thousands of years ago; it makes me loathe you. I’ll start with you!” Ke Luo’s voice sounded again, utterly composed, as if he truly could control the life and death of everyone in the blood sea.

Yang Kai distinctly felt vast energies converging in one direction within the blood sea, and then cries and the sounds of combat erupted from that area.

Within three breaths’ time, the enraged roar of the demon general Ba He sounded: “If you want to kill me, don’t think you’ll fare well!”

A surging Demon Yuan rolled forth, and the commotion from that area intensified.

A muffled groan rose; Ba He’s aura suddenly grew ragged, his breaths coming in gasping pulls as if something had pierced his heart and lungs.

“Ba He!” Changyuan roared in a low, furious voice.

“My lord, avenge me!” Ba He howled to the heavens with an ear-splitting cry. With a bursting sound, his aura abruptly vanished.

In the gloom, his soul-energy dispersed into the blood sea.

“Ba He is dead?” The other three demon generals scattered through the blood pool cried out in shock, faces showing stunned horror.

Among the Four Great Demon Generals, Ba He had the shortest tenure.

Though the weakest among them, he was still a Third Stage of the Saint Realm expert.

Yet after engaging Ke Luo, he perished within merely ten breaths—what sort of power could Ke Luo exert within this blood sea to accomplish that?

Meng Ge, Gou Qiong, and Xueli were all bewildered and fearful, worried that they might be next; they hurriedly wove through the blood pool in search of Changyuan’s figure, praying for some shelter.

The moment Ba He’s aura vanished, Yang Kai once again circulated True Yuan, pouring it frantically into the Blood Essence Stone in his hand.

A massive suction force spread outward; from one direction of the blood pool, surging streams of blood-qi were drawn in and vanished into the Blood Essence Stone.

That was Ba He’s blood-qi!

At that instant the Blood Essence Stone finally functioned, preventing Ke Luo from becoming stronger.

“Hmph, I’ll finish you later!” Ke Luo snorted coldly in Yang Kai’s ear. He showed no hurry to take Yang Kai’s life—of those present Yang Kai’s cultivation was the lowest, and Ke Luo felt he could kill him at will.

“My lord.” Gou Qiong’s voice came from somewhere, carrying a hint of relief.

“What is it?” Changyuan replied from another spot.

Gou Qiong seemed stunned for a moment, then uttered an astonished cry: “You are……”

He appeared to witness something incredible, and with Demon Yuan erupting, he shouted warnings while fighting: “He can take the form of anyone within the blood pool—be careful!”

Everyone’s expressions changed in a flash.

They then understood why Gou Qiong’s tone had held relief earlier—he had believed he had found the demon lord Changyuan, but that figure had been only an illusion Ke Luo had formed from the blood sea’s energy.

Taken off guard, they must have already been ambushed.

“Gou Qiong!” Xueli cried out, but received no reply.

The Blood Essence Stone in Yang Kai’s hand drew in a tremendous surge of blood-qi again; the fate of Gou Qiong was clear.

“Gou Qiong!” Meng Ge shouted fiercely as well.

Although the Four Great Demon Generals ordinarily did not meddle with one another, in the space of a blink two comrades had fallen. Meng Ge and Xueli felt wretched and sorrowful, their hearts heavy with a tragic sympathy.

At a certain point in the blood pool, Changyuan’s face darkened as if it would drip with gloom. He bit his teeth and howled: “I will make you pay. I swear on my honor, you will pay!”

“You don’t have the standing!” Ke Luo sneered. “If that powerful one of your race were still alive, my people would never dare to wake. But his aura has vanished—he has long since perished. In this world, no one can touch me. Don’t worry: after I kill you I will use your Essence-Blood and bones to make tribe members identical to you, and let them live in your stead.”

He crowed arrogantly, wielding the Bone Race’s forbidden art to toy with them all.

“You’re in my way. Looks like I’ll have to kill you first!” Ke Luo’s voice rang in Yang Kai’s ear once more. Twice already he had slain victims without gaining any blood-qi because Yang Kai’s Blood Essence Stone had claimed it all, which annoyed him greatly.

After slaughtering two demon generals and settling millennia-old scores, he finally turned his attention to Yang Kai.

A ghastly white bone, sharp as a spear, weaved through the blood pool with deadly accuracy toward Yang Kai’s position.

Silent and utterly sinister.

By the time Yang Kai detected it, the bone spike was already close at hand.

“Master, watch out!” Han Fei had been scanning the surroundings and, sensing danger, screamed.

Pfft…

With a dull sound, even Yang Kai’s iron-strong body was pierced through by the sharp bone spike; a hole opened in his lower abdomen and golden blood gushed forth.

“Master!” Li Rong cried out from somewhere, alarmed. “Han Fei, how is he?”

Han Fei could not answer; she could not see Yang Kai’s condition—though standing beside him she too was cut off by the thick blood, seeing only a field of red.

Yet through spirit-sense she detected a hitch in Yang Kai’s aura; he had been injured.

Her heart panicked.

“It’s nothing!” Yang Kai shouted, forcing calm into his voice, gripping the bone spike that ran through him with both hands, eyes fixed ahead.

Within the blood there was a faint humanoid silhouette holding the other end of the bone spike.

Yang Kai felt Ke Luo staring coldly at him from before his eyes.

“I’ve heard you mention that man from thousands of years ago more than once—are you afraid of him?” Yang Kai asked, his expression stern and his voice low.

“Afraid!” Ke Luo admitted without the slightest hesitation. “I was never his match. With just a casual strike, he sent me crashing down unconscious, and the experts of my race were slaughtered almost to the last. Tell me, how could I not be afraid?”

As he spoke he twisted the bone spike with force, sending Yang Kai fresh waves of pain and unbearable torment.

It was as if he were venting his humiliation onto Yang Kai.

“But thanks to that, I was spared being slaughtered and slept in this land for thousands of years, waiting for him to fall!” Ke Luo laughed wildly. “No other race can compare to my race’s longevity!”

Their life essence was contained in their bone bodies—so long as the bone remained, they were nearly immortal.

“What if I told you he did not fall?” Yang Kai hissed.

The faint figure before him suddenly became slightly clearer; Ke Luo’s composure cracked under the shock, fear rising. Then he bellowed: “Impossible! His aura truly vanished—he couldn’t still be alive! In the great war he was already spent; he must have died long ago. Don’t you try to fool me!”

“Then open your eyes and see whether he’s still alive!” Yang Kai’s expression turned feral as he wiped his fingertip across the wound in his abdomen; his fingertip was stained with golden blood, which he pressed into his left eye.

The golden blood flowed into his left eye like the sea swallowing a ripple, not a drop remaining.

The black and white of the eyeball drained in an instant, turning a shocking, pure white.

Soon an imposing gold emerged within that white; a sliver of golden pupil formed in the stark eye, scornful of the world and gazing down upon all.
