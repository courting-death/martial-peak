## Chapter 698 — Dark Arrow

In the silent desolate ridge, a party of several people walked at an unhurried pace.

Cang Yan led the way in front, Li Wan and Fei Yu guarded the rear, while Yang Kai, Mi Na and Elder Du were sheltered in the middle.

Except for Mi Na, the others wore calm expressions, as if unaware that danger was looming.

As they walked, Yang Kai's face suddenly went cold.

He discovered, to his shock, that Fei Jian had at some unknown moment vanished without a trace; silently, this Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm powerhouse had slipped from everyone's sight, and even Yang Kai had not noticed.

Night wind blew, towering trees swayed, leaves whispered, and in that darkness shapes seemed to flicker like ghosts.

Mi Na's pretty face drained of color; she unconsciously edged closer to Yang Kai, nestling against him for security, her lovely eyes scanning the surroundings in terror.

Yang Kai gently squeezed her hand; Mi Na relaxed somewhat but did not stray from his side.

A faint arc lifted the corner of Cang Yan's mouth, as if he delighted in the tense thrill; Li Wan and Fei Yu at the rear sneered repeatedly, glancing about with eager anticipation.

Even Elder Du, the alchemist, appeared composed and unshaken, moving with calm assurance.

He clearly had great confidence in the strength of these four from Tianxiao Sect.

Suddenly, a string of eerie, mocking laughs spread from the darkness like ghostly cries, sinister and unnerving; in that moment the night wind that brushed past seemed far colder.

Soon, several people's laughter rang by their ears, attempting to disturb their minds.

The Tianxiao Sect party remained unruffled and continued forward at a steady pace.

Half an hour later the teasing laughter gradually died down; the other side apparently discovered this tactic could not unsettle Cang Yan and the others, and they abandoned the tiresome trick.

"Hiding their heads and showing their tails — a bunch of cowardly rats!" Cang Yan muttered in displeasure; he had expected a grand fight and his blood was boiling, yet the opponents showed no intent to strike, preferring to play tricks and probe.

This annoyed him greatly.

"Li Wan, go take a look," Cang Yan ordered.

Li Wan sneered, his small frame suddenly vanishing into the darkness.

Moments later a piercing, dreadful scream tore through the forest, chilling to the bone.

The scream was extremely brief; they had been struck down before they even had time to react.

In the next moment another similar scream came from a different direction.

Yang Kai's gaze flickered; he could confirm those two screams were separated by at least several hundred zhang, and that in such a short time their hiding places had been located and a fatal blow delivered—Li Wan's strength could be glimpsed.

After a moment Li Wan returned composed, shrugged at Cang Yan and said, "Two First Stage of the Transcendent Realm trash — not even enough to stuff between my teeth."

He licked his lips as if still unsatisfied.

On hearing that, Mi Na's eyes rolled and she fainted outright.

"This little girl...her courage is too small," Li Wan said in disbelief.

Yang Kai shook his head and hoisted Mi Na onto his shoulder.

Fei Yu suddenly laughed coquettishly, "She must think you ate someone."

Li Wan's face went dark as he realized the ambiguity of his words; he wanted to explain but had lost his audience, and was furious with himself.

The group pressed on; it seemed Li Wan's earlier killing of two had made the other side more wary.

For two consecutive hours nothing unusual occurred around them.

Yet Yang Kai still keenly sensed faint strands of hostility drifting about.

If they let their guard down, the enemy would surely not hesitate to strike hard.

Cang Yan, growing impatient, suddenly halted, cast a cold look around and barked, "If you intend to kill and seize treasure, come out and fight! If you continue hiding like this — then we're leaving."

The surroundings were silent; there was no reply.

Cang Yan slowly shook his head, clearly disappointed, waved his hand, and a long sword shot out and sank into the ground dozens of zhang away.

Yang Kai's eyelids narrowed; in an instant he recognized that long sword as the Secret Treasure Cang Yan and Fei Yu had obtained that day in that previous person's cave.

"This is a Saint-Grade Secret Treasure. Frankly, I haven't had time to refine it yet—don't you want it? Kill me and it's yours. Saint-Grade Secret Treasures are rare," Cang Yan said lightly.

"I have one too," Fei Yu, intent on stirring trouble, casually tossed her own Saint-Grade Secret Treasure out.

Two unrefined Saint-Grade Secret Treasures lay side by side, and in an instant countless Divine Senses latched onto them like leeches.

Yang Kai seemed to hear heavy, greedy breaths coming from the surroundings.

"Hey, when did you two get Saint-Grade Secret Treasures?" Li Wan widened his eyes, filled with envy, "How come I didn't know?"

"Months ago," Fei Yu smiled, glancing at Yang Kai, "got them on the way back from fetching my little junior-nephew."

"No way, why didn't I get any?" Li Wan protested loudly.

"There were only two; Fei Yu and I each took one. Though, speaking of it, there was also a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level treasure with Fei Yu."

"Give it to me! Give it to me!" Li Wan hurriedly reached toward Fei Yu.

"What about Fei Jian?" Fei Yu frowned, looking somewhat troubled.

"Who cares if he's alive or dead; as long as he has a bow."

"Here's the deal: whoever kills the most gets the treasure," Fei Yu smiled faintly.

Li Wan clapped his hands, "Good idea — I've already killed two."

At that moment, figures suddenly burst from the darkness like lightning, all racing toward the two Saint-Grade Secret Treasures.

The few had been arguing here; the others clearly could not restrain themselves and thought it an excellent chance to act.

A gleam flashed in Cang Yan's eyes and the corner of his mouth twitched.

Each of those figures radiated the fierce aura of the Transcendent Realm; with incredible speed they reached the Saint-Grade Secret Treasures in the blink of an eye.

Countless large hands reached out to grab the treasures.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

In Yang Kai's peripheral vision, streaks of golden light flashed across the night sky.

Blood sprayed; those who had rushed to the Saint-Grade Secret Treasures were hurled backward by tremendous force, each body riddled with a fist-sized hole, their flesh pierced through.

And without exception, those holes were all at the position of the heart.

Suspended midair, those cultivators instantly lost all life.

One strike, instant death!

They hadn't even discerned where such razor-sharp, precise attacks had come from.

Li Wan's expression changed; he kicked into motion and dashed over, shouting, "Fei Jian, you treacherous bastard! If you have the guts, come fight openly — what good is shooting people with hidden arrows?"

Fei Jian did not reply; arrows filled with destructive energy shot from the least expected angles, and before the enemies could react their lives were taken.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense, trying to trace the origin of those arrows to locate Fei Jian's hiding place, but found nothing.

His expression turned stern as he immediately realized the power of that buck-toothed senior uncle.

The battle had lasted no more than ten breaths; by the time Li Wan struggled up and killed one enemy, the surroundings suddenly fell quiet again.

Only the overwhelming stench of blood lingered at everyone's nostrils.

The rustle of robes sounded as the remaining hidden enemies — only two or three — retreated swiftly.

They knew the Tianxiao Sect party were not opponents they could deal with.

Two people had already slaughtered them to the last man; if all four had engaged, the consequences would have been unthinkable.

Waves of powerful Divine Sense poured continuously into Yang Kai's mind; he delved a little with his spirit and found that the fallen enemies were basically all First to Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm cultivators — there were no Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm present.

He couldn't help but feel a little regretful; practitioners at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm should have some insights on how to break into the Saint Realm.

Yang Kai needed those.

At present, his comprehension of the Dao and martial path, his mental cultivation, had no bottleneck before breaking into the Saint Realm. But how to make the breakthrough into the Saint Realm — he had not grasped the key.

Although at Mo Shen Fort he had slain Chu Jian, a foe who was at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, and gained some of his insights, Yang Kai's understanding of entering the Saint Realm remained shallow.

Yang Kai needed a great number of powerful souls; from their insights and experiences he hoped to glean the path he must take.

Cang Yan and Fei Yu had already retrieved their Secret Treasures.

"What fools — of course I would refine a Saint-Grade Secret Treasure," Cang Yan sneered as he stored the treasure within his body.

Li Wan trudged back, dejected and green with envy, sighing heavily.

Fei Jian reappeared like a specter, shamelessly thrusting out a large hand toward Fei Yu, baring his buck teeth as he said, "Give it to me."

Fei Yu smiled and placed the Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure she had obtained earlier into Fei Jian's hand.

From start to finish Li Wan had killed only three people, while Fei Jian had slain five or six in a single volley — this contest was undoubtedly won by Fei Jian.

Yang Kai drew a deep breath; this battle had seemed effortless, but he knew only this handful from Tianxiao Sect could accomplish such a feat.

Perhaps other Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm cultivators could not handle it so easily.

Moreover, the gap in strength between stages within the Transcendent Realm was quite distinct. Before reaching the Transcendent Realm, a great realm is divided into nine layers with relatively small differences between each layer.

But the Transcendent Realm is different — First Stage, Second Stage, Third Stage — each advancement brings a leap in power.

These hidden enemies had misjudged the gap between themselves and the Tianxiao Sect party; lured by the treasures, they were utterly foolish.

After this fight the road ahead seemed considerably calmer; skirmishes along the way grew sparse. Those who came here were all focused on the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, and no one wished to clash before the flower had bloomed.

Everyone understands the lesson of the snipe and the clam fighting — the fisherman benefits.
