## Chapter 259 â€” True Yuan Realm

Yang Kai's situation was quite unique.

It was likely that there wouldn't be another case like it for a thousand years. To cultivate Divine Sense at the Ninth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm was not something an ordinary person could achieve. Divine Sense was a hallmark of the Divine Roaming Realm, and generally speaking, it was impossible to cultivate it in the Separation and Union Realm.

Moreover, Yang Kai currently possessed only Divine Sense without a Sea of Consciousness, making his case even more extraordinary.

The Sea of Consciousness was the ocean of Divine Sense! It was a direct manifestation of a martial artist's spiritual power. When a martial artist reached the Divine Roaming Realm and cultivated Divine Sense, it would gather into a vast existence resembling an ocean, forming the Sea of Divine Sense.

The size and depth of the Sea of Consciousness were directly proportional to the strength of the martial artist's Divine Sense.

Regarding Yang Kai's current situation, Di Mo was at a loss for words.

"That drop of amber-colored liquid should be the Soul Cleansing Dew that Zhuo Wen mentioned!" Yang Kai's eyes sparkled with certainty.

Previously, by the lake, Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu's master, Zhuo Wen, had said that thirty years ago, someone had found something extraordinary in this otherworldly place.

One was the Liuyan Liquid, and the other was the Soul Cleansing Dew!

Attracted by these two treasures, more and more people had come here to train and explore.

By killing Qi Jianxing, Yang Kai inadvertently obtained several drops of Liuyan Liquid, refining his Yuan Qi. Now, while pursuing Chi Xue, he had also acquired a drop of Soul Cleansing Dew, truly a stroke of good fortune.

Moreover, there was not just one drop of Soul Cleansing Dew!

Yang Kai turned to look and saw that the small pit in the stone had already formed a layer of amber-colored crystalline threads at the bottom. He believed that if he waited a little longer, another drop of Soul Cleansing Dew would form.

With the Warm Spirit Lotus in his mind, a supreme treasure for cultivating Divine Sense, and after being attacked by the white mist for over half a month, combined with the powerful effects of a drop of Soul Cleansing Dew, it was precisely these opportunities that allowed Yang Kai to cultivate his Divine Sense at the Ninth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm.

"Young Master, how far can your Divine Sense cover when fully unleashed?" Di Mo pondered before asking.

"About two or three li!" 

Di Mo gasped in surprise and smiled wryly. "Young Master, your fortune is not shallow. This Divine Sense strength already far exceeds that of an ordinary martial artist who has just entered the Divine Roaming Realm, roughly equivalent to the level of the Third Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai grinned.

"Yes, generally speaking, even if one breaks through to the Divine Roaming Realm, the newly formed Divine Sense is quite fragile. At that time, even if the Divine Sense spreads out, it can only detect situations within a hundred zhang at most. Only through slow cultivation and nurturing can the effects of Divine Sense grow stronger."

Di Mo, with his rich experience and knowledge, though sometimes unreliable, still offered invaluable insights.

As Di Mo recounted the powerful benefits and conveniences of Divine Sense, Yang Kai listened with excitement and encouragement, filled with boundless anticipation.

With Divine Sense, it became easier to hide and infiltrate. Coupled with his skill in concealing his aura, if he did not take action, even those at the Fifth or Sixth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm would likely be unable to discern his depth.

After chatting with Di Mo for a long time, Yang Kai's emotions fluctuated.

He glanced again at the small pit in the stone. The amber crystalline threads seemed to have increased in number, but the formation of the Soul Cleansing Dew was too slow.

It would likely take at least ten more days to form another drop.

The surrounding white mist continued to pour violently into the small hole above the stone, gathering in the pit to form part of the Soul Cleansing Dew.

The white mist attacked the soul, while the Soul Cleansing Dew formed from the white mist greatly benefited the soul. What mysteries lay hidden in this transformation, and whether it was related to this peculiar stone, Yang Kai had no idea.

Nor did he need to know; he just had to wait patiently for the Soul Cleansing Dew to form and then retrieve it.

"Di Mo, keep an eye on it. If the Soul Cleansing Dew forms, call me. I need to enter seclusion to break through to the True Yuan Realm!" 

"Understood, Young Master, rest assured."

Closing his eyes, Yang Kai immersed his entire mind into his body, unleashing dozens of drops of Yang Liquid from his Dantian.

In an instant, the True Yang Yuan Qi filled his meridians, causing them to swell, and a wave of soreness washed over him.

Without a word, Yang Kai operated the True Yang Technique, absorbing the energy of heaven and earth from the outside while compressing and refining the Yuan Qi within his body, causing his meridians to undulate, contracting and expanding continuously.

Time passed slowly, and the True Yang Yuan Qi in his meridians gradually underwent subtle changes. After being filled with such abundant Yuan Qi for an extended period, his meridians became much wider and thicker than before, and they also gained greater resilience.

The transformation of his meridians also increased the speed of the True Yang Technique's operation, and the True Yang Yuan Qi began to refine and merge with each other, gradually becoming more pure.

Once that feeling of soreness and swelling dissipated, Yang Kai unleashed five more drops of Yang Liquid, repeating the previous actions.

While Yang Kai refined and merged his Yuan Qi, the white mist outside relentlessly attacked his soul, and the Warm Spirit Lotus continuously played its role in repairing.

His Divine Sense slowly grew, keeping pace with the True Yang Yuan Qi within him.

About ten days later, Di Mo awakened Yang Kai from his seclusion.

A drop of Soul Cleansing Dew had formed once again!

Yang Kai retrieved it, this time not consuming it but placing it into a bottle.

Generally, precious heaven-and-earth treasures could only be consumed once. Even if they were effective the second time, the effect would not be as pronounced.

The Soul Cleansing Dew was too precious, and Yang Kai did not wish to squander such a treasure.

If he brought it back to refine into a pill, consuming it again would allow him to harness its full effects.

Time flies in cultivation, and this saying held true. After exiting seclusion, Yang Kai devoted all his heart and mind to refining his meridians and Dantian, striving to purify and strengthen his Yuan Qi, making it more refined and powerful, to the point that he hardly noticed the passage of time.

From time to time, Di Mo would awaken him, and another drop of Soul Cleansing Dew would be added to the bottle.

It wasn't until the bottle was filled with a little over half, containing at least a dozen drops, that Yang Kai gradually touched the threshold of the True Yuan Realm!

This time in seclusion lasted nearly four months, during which he consumed no pills and absorbed no Yang Qi, relying solely on the operation of the True Yang Technique and his willpower to refine his Yuan Qi, finally stepping out of the Ninth Stage of the Separation and Union Realm!

Although the primary purpose of staying here was still to collect Soul Cleansing Dew, the length of time it took to advance also illustrated how difficult it was to cross the threshold into the True Yuan Realm.

Many martial artists spend their entire lives unable to cross this hurdle, lamenting their wasted years in silence.

A layer of shackles weighed down on them, sealing their Yuan Qi and preventing any breakthrough in the final fusion and refinement.

Yang Kai took a deep breath and opened his eyes, his gaze flickering.

His mind sank back into the Proud Bone Golden Body, where a small amount of Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew was stored.

This was a treasure obtained with Xia Ningshang in the Jiuyin Valley, which he later split with Su Yan, keeping half for himself, and it was only now that it came in handy.

He drew out this small amount of Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew from the Proud Bone Golden Body and poured it into his Dantian.

The True Yang Technique operated frantically, refining the effects of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew. A sudden chill erupted from within his Dantian, spreading outward at an astonishing speed through his meridians, filling his limbs and bones.

Crack, crack...

Visibly, Yang Kai's entire body, including his clothes and hair tips, was covered in ice shards.

Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew was a supreme treasure for refining Yuan Qi, even more precious than Liuyan Liquid. It was a crystallization of countless years of Yin energy, and the coldness contained within it was something even Yang Kai's True Yang Yuan Qi found somewhat difficult to withstand.

But heat was indeed the nemesis of cold, and Yang Kai did not feel too uncomfortable.

Wherever the effects of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew passed, the True Yang Yuan Qi instantly solidified and became dense, as if some reaction had occurred between the two, creating radiating ripples that spread outward with a loud boom.

As the ripples expanded, the already pure True Yang Yuan Qi became even more refined!

The chill gradually faded, and within his meridians, the sound of flowing Yuan Qi echoed like a clear spring in the mountains, crisp and pleasant.

Crack...

The ice shards on Yang Kai's clothes and hair tips shattered into powder.

The world changed color as violent energy gathered in mid-air, increasing in quantity until it reached a terrifying level before suddenly pouring down, directly crashing into Yang Kai's body.

The fortune of advancing a major realm had arrived!

Yang Kai trembled, and every pore in his body opened wide. The True Yang Technique emitted a low hum, accepting the might of heaven and earth.

This force of heaven and earth traveled through his meridians, with part of it merging into his flesh and bones, refining his body. The other part, which Yang Kai could not absorb in time, should have returned to the heavens and earth, becoming part of nature again. However, at this moment, not a trace escaped, all absorbed by the Proud Bone Golden Body.

Every martial artist experiences such fortune when advancing a major realm, but how much benefit one can gain depends on their effort and limits of endurance.

Ordinary martial artists, no matter how good their talent or strength, can usually only absorb about thirty percent. This thirty percent primarily serves to refine the martial artist's body, allowing it to withstand the corresponding impact of Yuan Qi, while the remaining seventy percent dissipates.

However, since Yang Kai's first major breakthrough, every time he received the might of heaven and earth, he absorbed at least ninety percent! And this time, he did not let a single drop escape.

The might of the Proud Bone Golden Body was evident.

As the chaotic energy of heaven and earth gradually calmed, Yang Kai's aura slowly retracted, becoming indistinguishable from an ordinary person.

Taking a long breath, Yang Kai opened his eyes, brimming with spirit.

True Yuan Realm!

After all the hard work and trials, he finally reached the height of the True Yuan Realm!

Once, the True Yuan Realm was something he looked up to, and at this moment, he stood on the same stage as the masters of the True Yuan Realm!

It took only two years.

Even considering the three years of previous stagnation, it was only five years!

Cultivating to the True Yuan Realm in five years is a feat of extraordinary talent anywhere.

Gently clenching his fist, Yang Kai felt an indescribable explosive power coursing through him. The Yuan Qi flowing in his meridians had fundamentally changed, becoming more solid and filled with stronger energy compared to the previous ethereal, mist-like state.
