## Chapter 2279 — Get Lost

“I was just passing by; I never expected to encounter such a thing. At that time my cultivation was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. With immortals fighting, I could only watch from afar and saw everything with my own eyes,” Yang Kai added.

“What? You were at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm at that time?” Gao Shan and Liu Shui were stunned, then, realizing what this meant, exclaimed in shock.

If what Yang Kai said was true, two years ago he was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and now he was already at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Advancing a Stage every year—such a rapid pace of development was simply terrifying.

At this rate, wouldn’t he reach the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm next year, and the year after that, become an Emperor?

Of course, breaking through from the Dao Origin Realm to the Emperor Realm was not simple, but given ten or twenty years, Yang Kai would likely achieve it, right? Moreover, Gao Shan and Liu Shui had heard that this brat had swallowed a Supreme Mystic Pill in the Four Seasons Land, making his chances of advancing to the Emperor Realm much higher than most.

Thinking about how the two of them had struggled for most of their lives and still couldn’t even touch the threshold of the Emperor Realm, while this brat, at such a young age, already had hope of breaking through, the two elders felt all sorts of emotions welling up in their hearts—sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy, all mixed together.

“So…” Yang Kai spread his hands, “Ning Yuancheng’s death has nothing to do with me.”

Ning Yuanshu frowned, not knowing whether to believe him. After a moment of silence, he suddenly asked, “Then what about my eldest brother’s belongings? I heard you once used a Secret Treasure flying ship from my Fei Sheng Palace. Where is that Secret Treasure now? And… at that auction, my eldest brother also won a fire-type Artifact Spirit. Where is that Artifact Spirit?”

“What is the Young Palace Master talking about? I don’t understand.” Yang Kai glanced sidelong at Ning Yuanshu.

“Stop pretending to be confused!” Ning Yuanshu shouted angrily. “My eldest brother is dead, but his belongings are still the property of Fei Sheng Palace. I need to recover them.”

Yang Kai scratched his face and said, “Don’t be like that. Fei Sheng Palace is a huge force—what’s one or two Secret Treasure flying ships to you?”

“If it’s nothing, then give it back to me!” Ning Yuanshu shouted.

Yang Kai sighed. "Alright. I’ll just tell you the truth. That Secret Treasure flying ship… has already been destroyed."

“De… destroyed?” Ning Yuanshu’s eyes widened in shock. “Impossible! That was a Dao Origin-Grade flying ship, enough to withstand a fierce assault from anyone below the Emperor Realm. It couldn’t be destroyed so easily. Even Fei Sheng Palace doesn’t have many such ships.”

Yang Kai replied seriously, “It was destroyed by an expert in the Emperor Realm.”

The Secret Treasure flying ship was indeed destroyed, shattered in a single blow by Aunt Feng, who took Mo Xiaoqi away. Aunt Feng was an expert at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm. Destroying a flying ship was nothing to her. Later, to compensate Yang Kai for his loss, Aunt Feng gave him a Secret Treasure wooden boat. Although it wasn’t as grand as the flying ship, it was simple, light, and quite convenient to use.

Hearing this, Ning Yuanshu’s mouth twitched. “Just what kind of people have you provoked?!”

Gao Shan was also shocked. “You fought with an Emperor Realm expert? And survived?”

For a moment, the people from Fei Sheng Palace regarded Yang Kai as something extraordinary.

"It wasn’t really a fight," Yang Kai blushed. "I was just being trampled. Fortunately, that senior didn’t intend to kill me…" As he spoke, he continued, "Besides, after Ning Yuancheng died, that flying ship became ownerless. Whoever picked it up owned it. Since I picked it up, it became mine. Why are you all still pestering me?"

“Fine!” Ning Yuanshu shouted in a low voice. “Even if the flying ship was destroyed, what about the fire-type Artifact Spirit? I heard that Artifact Spirit has already developed its own intelligence!”

Yang Kai sneered, “The Young Palace Master already said it—the Artifact Spirit developed intelligence, so of course it ran away!”

“Ran away?”

“You’ve seen for yourself how powerful an Artifact Spirit with its own intelligence can be.” Yang Kai sneered. He was referring, of course, to the Artifact Spirit of the demonic war weapon.

Hearing this, Ning Yuanshu’s expression changed, clearly recalling the scene of the Artifact Spirit’s rampage earlier, and he couldn’t help but look a bit terrified.

“So… there’s nothing left?” Gao Shan frowned.

“What else could there be? Didn’t I already give you an explanation?” Yang Kai chuckled. “As for your Fei Sheng Palace’s other expert, Fu Sitong… Hm. That man is very powerful. Even if I said I killed him, you probably wouldn’t believe it.”

“As if you have that ability!” Ning Yuanshu sneered, “Elder Fu’s death—City Lord Duan already said it was due to being corrupted by Demonic Qi.”

“Exactly.” Yang Kai clapped his hands and grinned. “Then our misunderstanding is resolved. In the future, don’t come bothering me, saying I harmed people from your Fei Sheng Palace. Young Palace Master, I think you’re not bad. Let’s get along well from now on and be friends.”

Hearing the words ‘friends’, Ning Yuanshu reflexively glanced around, afraid that demonic Artifact Spirit would come to kill again.

“That’s not for you to decide!” Gao Shan shook his head slowly.

“Then is it up to you?” Yang Kai’s face turned cold.

“It’s not up to us either,” Liu Shui interjected.

“Then who decides?” Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

Gao Shan said, “If you truly have a clear conscience, why not return to the Palace with us and explain everything to the Palace Master in person? Let the Palace Master decide!”

“That’s right!” Liu Shui nodded. “You must return to the Palace with us.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai chuckled, looking at Gao Shan with deep meaning. “Two Protectors, are you misunderstanding something?”

“What?”

“I’m willing to explain all this to you, not because I fear you, but simply because I don’t want unnecessary trouble. Believe it or not, but if you dare to provoke me again for no reason… heh heh…” As he spoke, his face was full of smiles, but his eyes were icy cold.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui suddenly felt a chill run through their bodies, a sense of extreme danger welling up, and their pupils shrank sharply.

Then they remembered—this brat Yang Kai had a close relationship with Gao Xueting of Qingyang Shrine. Just now, Elder Gao had even told him in front of many people to visit her room that night. With this connection, they didn’t dare lay a hand on Yang Kai. If they angered Gao Xueting, their lives would be at risk.

Even if the Palace Master came in person, he might not be able to do anything to Yang Kai, unless they could secretly abduct him without anyone knowing.

Thinking of this, Gao Shan and Liu Shui both felt the situation was getting tricky.

Gao Shan said, “Young Master Yang, if you’re unwilling to return to the Palace with us, at least write a letter for us to give to the Palace Master, so he won’t blame us for neglecting our duties and returning from Fenglin City empty-handed…”

“Not my problem!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

“Come on, Young Master Yang, let’s talk this over…” Gao Shan pleaded with a fawning face.

“Get… lost!” As Yang Kai spoke, he swept the Myriad Sword Imperial Treasure across in front of him and snarled, “I’ll say this one last time—if you keep pestering me, stubbornly refusing to listen, don’t blame me for showing no mercy!”

As soon as he finished speaking, surging Origin Qi erupted, and his pure Divine Sense burst forth violently, enveloping Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

Gao Shan and Liu Shui were terrified. In that instant, the young man before them seemed to grow incomparably tall, blocking out all the light before their eyes. The pressure he exuded was like a great mountain pressing on their chests, making it hard to breathe.

Only now did the two finally realize that Yang Kai’s strength… was probably not inferior to Luo Yuan’s.

In what felt like both an instant and an eternity, when the two elders came to their senses, Yang Kai was already gone, leaving them feeling uncomfortable. They exchanged glances, both seeing the shock in each other’s eyes.

“We can’t provoke this man anymore,” Gao Shan said in a low voice, his face full of lingering fear. His instincts told him that if they kept pestering Yang Kai, he might really go on a killing spree.

“Mm.” Liu Shui wiped the sweat from his forehead and nodded heavily.

“So I just let him beat me up for nothing?” Ning Yuanshu pointed at his own cheek in grief and indignation. “He humiliated me so badly before, and… Zhuang Pan was also killed by him. Is my Fei Sheng Palace supposed to swallow this? How am I supposed to get by in the Southern Territory from now on?”

Gao Shan glanced at him and sighed, “Zhuang Pan was a petty, miserly man—his death is no loss. As for you, Young Palace Master… just treat it like a mosquito bite!”

Hearing this, Ning Yuanshu’s mouth twitched, but since even the two elders said so, he was powerless to seek revenge, and could only feel a bitterness in his mouth worse than eating bitter herbs.

…

Yang Kai returned to the Qin Family estate with Qin Chaoyang and the others.

Right now, Yang Kai truly had nowhere else to go in Fenglin City. He’d once rented a cave-dwelling, but after the lease expired last time, he hadn’t renewed it. Fortunately, the Qin Family didn't consider him an outsider, so staying there felt perfectly natural.

The people from the Eight Directions Sect also returned there. Led by Luo Yuan and the round-faced woman, they went to their own courtyards, each going their separate ways.

However, Yang Kai noticed that Luo Yuan’s gaze was dangerous, as if he still wanted to fight him, which gave Yang Kai a headache.

Qin Chaoyang personally led Yang Kai to a courtyard and said, "Brother Yang, this courtyard was specially cleaned by my servants on my orders. It’s one of the best residences in my Qin Family. Please rest here."

“Thank you, Patriarch Qin,” Yang Kai replied politely.

“No need to be so polite! If you need anything, just call for the servants.” Qin Chaoyang laughed heartily. “Alright, I won’t disturb your rest. I’ll go check on Yu’er.”

“Take care, Patriarch Qin!”

After Qin Chaoyang left, Yang Kai led Zhang Ruoxi inside. As they walked, he looked around. The courtyard wasn’t very large, but it was quiet and elegant, spotlessly clean, and the Spiritual Qi was quite abundant, which satisfied Yang Kai.

After looking around for a while, Yang Kai let Zhang Ruoxi pick a room for herself, then turned back and looked speechlessly at Ye Qinghan, who had been silently following him like a shadow. He let out a deep sigh.

Seeing this, Ye Qinghan quickly bit her red lips and forced a smile.

“Stop smiling. It looks worse than crying,” Yang Kai said with a look of disdain.

Hearing this, Ye Qinghan’s delicate body trembled, her face turned pale, and her eyes reddened.
