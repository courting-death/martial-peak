## Chapter 1694 — Insect Emperor

They lost track of the movements of the Corpse Spirit Sect's leader; with a man of that caliber, trying to find him again now would be harder than reaching the heavens.

This operation couldn’t be called a success, but most likely, the Corpse Spirit Sect’s Cult Master wouldn’t be making any more moves anytime soon. After all, he’d suffered heavy losses himself—especially when he unleashed that final strike with the Imperial Treasure, which must have placed immense strain on his body. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have waited until the very end to use it.

Qian Tong obviously understood this too, so he had no intention of asking Yang Kai to continue the pursuit. After a moment he said, "Although that man escaped, the Corpse Spirit Sect remains a major problem. Let's return to Zangxiong Valley and destroy that Corpse Den; I sensed before that many of the Corpse Spirit Race were slumbering within that den."

"Mm, I thought the same," Yang Kai agreed.

After a brief discussion the two set out at once, speeding toward the direction of Zangxiong Valley.

Three days later they returned to Zangxiong Valley. The Corpse Spirit Race that had once filled the valley had been massacred by Qian Tong's previous onslaught and suffered grievous losses, but they were not completely annihilated. The remaining Corpse Spirit Race had fled to unknown places, leaving only those still within the Corpse Den whose transformations had not finished.

Before Qian Tong destroyed the Corpse Den, Yang Kai once again went to the site of the Underworld Spring Source to see if there was any way to destroy it; after all, it was the origin of the Corpse Spirit Race's birth. Destroy it and the Corpse Spirit Race would no longer be able to increase in number; the remnants could be cleaned up gradually, and one day Dark Star would be peaceful again.

To his disappointment, it could not be destroyed. The Underworld Spring Source seemed to connect to another world; that thick Corpse Qi flowed from the other world and gathered into spring form at the Underworld Spring Source.

Rumor had it the Underworld Spring Source linked to the Underworld Hell!

The only way was to go deep inside and destroy the bridge that connected the two worlds.

Yang Kai would not risk that; he could only team up with Qian Tong to temporarily seal the aura of the Underworld Spring Source, then destroy the Corpse Den and exterminate those Corpse Spirit Race who were still in the process of transforming.

By the time Yang Kai and Qian Tong returned to Lingxiao Sect, ten days had passed.

They briefly recounted the operation to Ye Xijun and the others. Ye Xijun was greatly shocked—none of them had expected such a grotesque technique as infinite possession to exist in this world.

The other elders also sighed in astonishment.

"If what the Sect Master said is true, isn't the leader of the Corpse Spirit Sect essentially immortal?" Ye Xijun frowned.

"Not exactly. His possession art is strange and unfathomable, but it must inflict some harm on him. You can see that from the changes in the bodies he possesses. He slipped away this time. No one knows where he is hiding now; finding him will be difficult," Yang Kai sighed.

Ye Xijun nodded slightly. "Although we couldn't slay the Corpse Spirit Sect's leader, sealing the Underworld Spring Source is enough. The Corpse Spirit Race should no longer increase their numbers. It's time for our counterattack."

Yang Kai glanced at her and smiled faintly. "Great Elder, what are your plans?"

“Press the advantage!” Ye Xi Yun said in a deep voice. “The reason Dark Star’s situation has worsened over the past two years is partly because the Corpse Spirit Race is too strange—the number of powerful cultivators they’ve converted keeps increasing. But another reason is the lack of a leader that others can rally behind. Every sect and force has been fighting on its own, making them easy to pick off one by one. But now things are different. With the return of you and the Void King-Grade Warship, and Elder Qian’s breakthrough to the Void King Realm, as long as the two of you step forward—relying on the prestige of Lingxiao Sect and Yingyue Hall—I believe the entire Dark Star can be united. When that happens, what need will we have to fear the Corpse Spirit Race?”

"I have no objection. Dark Star is my homeland; it's my duty to aid it," Qian Tong immediately declared.

Ye Xijun turned her gaze to Yang Kai.

“I have no objections,” Yang Kai said with a light smile. “Then I’ll leave this matter to you, Great Elder, and Elder Qian. The entire Sect’s resources are at your disposal—just tell me where I’m needed, and I’ll lend a hand.”

“Since Sect Master wishes to slack off, then so be it. It’s settled,” Ye Xi Yun said decisively, making the decision on the spot.

The elders and Qian Tong then discussed the specifics: how to unite the remaining elites and forces of Dark Star, how to build authority, how to root out the Corpse Spirit Sect...

In truth it was simple. Lingxiao Sect's prestige was already considerable; with Qian Tong personally taking action, given his strength and status as a Void King Realm powerhouse, a single call would draw countless responses.

With the combined strength of the two sects, aided by a Void King-Grade Warship to gather and rescue those experts and sects troubled by the Corpse Spirit Sect, it would not be difficult. That force would snowball, and when it swept across Dark Star, the Corpse Spirit Sect would be no more!

Ye Xijun even prepared to have word sent out claiming that the mysterious leader of the Corpse Spirit Sect had been slain by Yang Kai and Qian Tong!

Though false, few would doubt it, and the Corpse Spirit Sect's leader, hidden and pressed for time, would naturally not step forward to refute it.

This news would greatly shake the confidence of the Corpse Spirit Race and the human warriors who had joined the Corpse Spirit Sect, and would greatly aid the coming campaign.

Yang Kai did not take part. He went alone to Yang Yan's tower.

“From what you said, that man really was the Insect Emperor.” Inside Yang Yan’s Sea of Consciousness, she sat facing Yang Kai, her expression thoughtful. “The Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu was one of the Insect Emperor’s secret arts, and that Soul Severing Blade was also his treasured artifact. I didn’t expect that after that battle back then, he actually survived… that was my oversight.”

"So that man was called the Insect Emperor!" Yang Kai exclaimed.

"Yes. What he excels at is raising and commanding strange insects and beasts. He can lodge his soul into those creatures he cultivates, allowing him to possess many times over. The Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu is merely one of the odd beasts under his command—nothing special, just effective for controlling subordinates. He has many other more fearsome methods. Wherever the Insect Emperor's swarms pass, they can leave an entire Star Domain in ruin!"

Yang Kai was horrified; he noticed Yang Yan had said Star Domain, not merely a single Cultivation Star.

Yang Yan pursed her lips and smiled. "Don't be so tense. To command such creatures one must have matching cultivation. At present he can only possess warriors at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, so he can't truly command too many of those beasts. Attempting to do so would backfire. That he could use the Ten-Thousand Poison Evil Gu at all is beyond my expectation. Believe me, he won't show his face again for years."

"But him being alive is still a calamity!" Yang Kai frowned.

He was deeply wary of the Insect Emperor—someone of a level comparable to Yang Yan. Who knew how great his capabilities truly were?

Yang Yan looked at him intently. “I do have a method — one that will allow you to slay him!”

"What way?" Yang Kai looked up at her.

Yang Yan said nothing; she reached out into the void and grabbed.

In the Sea of Consciousness a beautiful orb of multicolored light appeared suddenly in her hand, and she pressed her palm to Yang Kai's forehead.

Her movement was unhurried and seemingly casual, but Yang Kai didn't react until the orb suddenly imprinted onto his spirit body and vanished. He shuddered, "What is this?"

Yang Yan smiled faintly. "You will know when it's refined within you."

As soon as her words fell, Yang Kai suddenly felt a wild, primal aura explode within his Spirit Body. The force was so overwhelming that he couldn’t resist at all — his Spirit Body instantly shattered, and his Divine Sense was pulled back into his physical body.

The next moment, he opened his eyes — but what he saw was not the interior of the attic. Instead, he found himself in a void of utter chaos, a space without light or form, where not even his own existence could be sensed.

Yang Kai was slightly alarmed, unsure where this place was, but having endured great storms before, he remained composed and quietly observed.

The void world gradually accumulated a faint, obscure presence. These things condensed together and, over time, grew ever larger.

He didn’t know how much time had passed when a massive star appeared within his sight. It was utterly devoid of life — not even a single plant existed upon it. It was nothing more than a completely lifeless Dead Star.

Yang Kai looked at the massive star and felt a strange familiarity.

"Dark Star!" Yang Kai suddenly realized. Observed from the starry heavens, Dark Star matched this size and shape, except that now Dark Star teemed with life, unlike what he was seeing.

"I understand now." Only then did Yang Kai comprehend what Yang Yan had done; grateful and unwilling to lose the opportunity, he calmed himself and began to contemplate.

In that uncanny world Yang Kai could not sense the passage of time; it felt both an instant and eons. The barren Dark Star at last showed life: seas rose and fell, plants turned green, and sentient creatures began to appear.

Different races rose up, making ripples across the long river of history, and then vanished.

Different civilizations, seemingly eternal ages, passed beneath Yang Kai's detached observation.

He could feel an aura from a primordial, perhaps even more ancient era — and even as a mere observer, it was as if he had become part of it, accompanying that star through countless eons.

He personally witnessed the star's birth, its development, its peak, and its decline...

He gradually developed a strange feeling: he seemed to be the star, and the star seemed to be him!

Star Lord!

Only a Star Lord could have such a sensation.

When Xia Ningshang refined the Stellar Origin of Tongxuan Continent, Yang Kai assisted and observed the continent's evolution; what he now saw and sensed was remarkably similar.

This was clearly the process of refining a Stellar Origin and becoming a Star Lord!
