## Chapter 1739 — The Void King Fell

“Old dog Li!” Gu Jianxin had somehow surged forward and slain his way in; the sword light, round as the sun, dazzled the eyes and, like a falling star, struck toward Li Minghai.

At the same time, golden light suddenly flared all around, and a host of golden threads writhed like a nest of snakes, cutting through the void.

The spatial rifts that had opened up around Li Minghai’s body also began to widen and press upon him.

Almost in an instant, the helpless Li Minghai was inundated by all manner of forces.

The piercing brightness exploded from where Li Minghai stood, illuminating the nearby Star Domain with every detail; within that radiance, earth-shattering energy fluctuations surged as if to obliterate heaven and earth.

Gu Jianxin was thrown back face-up once more, even faster than the attacking speed; the prepared right Sword Sevant hurriedly met him and caught him.

With a soft gasp, Gu Jianxin leaned against the right Sword Sevant’s chest and spat a spray of blood.

“Young Master!” the right Sword Sevant cried out, worry filling her beautiful eyes.

Gu Jianxin had no time to answer; his eyes were fixed, unblinking, on what lay ahead.

He did not know whether Li Minghai was truly dead, but the sensation when that sword went forward had been unmistakable — it had struck, and had struck Li Minghai’s vital area.

But that was, after all, a Void King Realm expert! This was the first time Gu Jianxin had contended life and death with a Void King Realm expert; his lack of experience meant he dared not relax in the slightest until he had seen Li Minghai’s corpse with his own eyes.

As the light gradually dispersed, a figure still stood firm within the void.

Gu Jianxin’s pupils suddenly contracted.

Li Minghai!

Against such a terrifying assault, Li Minghai had not died. He had borne that violent energetic impact, and now this Void King Realm expert had disheveled hair and a ruined appearance; his clothes were in tatters. At some unknown moment he had donned an external protective treasured armor, but that armor had been blasted to pieces.

To Gu Jianxin’s great joy, Li Minghai’s injuries were clearly severe; his body was tattered, like a rag. Holes of all sizes and grotesque shapes riddled him from head to foot, and through those apertures one could even see Li Minghai’s bones and the writhing flesh.

Anger and terror painted Li Minghai’s face.

He was afraid! He had sensed the threat of death. That was why he was afraid!

The facts confirmed it. Li Minghai swept his gaze about. His eyes only lingered on Gu Jianxin and the right Sword Sevant for a moment before shifting and continuing to scour the void.

Unfortunately, he found nothing. He could not locate the trace of the young man who had struck from the shadows.

“You brat, one day I will have you pay for this!” Li Minghai roared, fierce but hollow, then dissolved into a streak of light and fled into the distance, leaving a trail of blood in the void behind him.

“We can’t let him escape!” Gu Jianxin shouted into the void, breath ragged.

No sooner had his words fallen than somewhere in the void a burst of five-colored radiance bloomed, like an undefeatable, world-cleaving sword qi, wielding the power to rend heaven and earth as it swept toward Li Minghai.

Li Minghai was astounded and cast a secret technique to defend himself.

But he was outwardly strong and inwardly weak; the method he employed could not even stem the five-colored radiance turned to sword qi. The radiance passed through Li Minghai’s body and vanished into the void like a gleaming meteor.

Li Minghai’s body froze in place; his eyes bulged and he no longer moved.

The vitality within him and the spark in his eyes rapidly ebbed away.

A full-fledged Void King Realm expert had, in fact, died right there!

From a distance, Gu Jianxin couldn’t tell what had happened. Gravely wounded, he dared not act rashly and simply kept a wary eye on Li Minghai’s corpse. A moment later, the still-shaken Left Sword Servant flew over to examine the body; after confirming his death, relief and joy appeared on her face as she hurried back toward Gu Jianxin.

When the left Sword Sevant returned, Gu Jianxin anxiously asked, “Well?”

“Li Minghai is dead!” the left Sword Sevant replied.

Gu Jianxin exhaled long and hard; he could no longer hold on and slumped into the right Sword Sevant’s supporting arms, still shaken as he murmured, “Good that he’s dead, good that he’s dead!”

“Young Master, that person just now…” the left Sword Sevant looked shocked and uncertain.

“He isn’t from our Sword Alliance.” Gu Jianxin shook his head, reached into his Spatial Ring for some Spiritual Pills, popped them into his mouth, and said, “Never mind that for the moment; you go support the others — that old dog Li brought quite a few experts with him, they may not be able to… huh…”

As Gu Jianxin spoke, he turned to glance at the battlefield and immediately noticed something strange.

Many of his own fighters were still alive, while Li Minghai’s men had almost all been killed or wounded. He had been engaged with Li Minghai and had no time to inspect the rest of the field; now that he looked, he was stupefied.

Gu Jianxin had a clear sense of the balance of power. His side was clearly weaker than Li Minghai’s.

After all, Li Minghai had prepared in advance, ambushed and set traps — how could he not have made thorough preparations?

That they had managed to slay Li Minghai and escape ruin must have been because someone of rank had aided them — yet how could his own men be so valiant?

He could hardly believe his eyes.

But after watching for a while, he finally understood what had happened.

It turned out to be because of Yue Xi and her two disciples!

Gu Jianxin knew Yue Xi and the two disciples He Zao and He Miao; no matter what, the three of them followed him. Although Yue Xi only had cultivation at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, she was still an Origin Returning Realm practitioner, and Gu Jianxin had some impression of her.

At this moment the three of them charged at the forefront, facing foes far stronger than themselves with unchanging faces.

Whenever they clashed, a crimson light would bloom within He Zao’s body, and their enemies would inexplicably fall…

What was that red light? Gu Jianxin could not make sense of it. He had never imagined that among his own followers there could be such an eerie warrior capable of such an unbelievable feat!

Over there the battle was already decided; Li Minghai’s side collapsed in rout and fled in panic, chased down and slaughtered by Gu Jianxin’s forces.

Gu Jianxin felt his heart settle and, drawing a deep breath, cupped his hands and shouted into the void, “May I ask the honored friend’s surname and name? I am deeply grateful for your aid just now; if you are willing, might you come out so I can thank you?”

“Heh, Young Alliance Master, no need for such ceremony.” A bright laugh came from somewhere, and Gu Jianxin turned to see the young man he had glimpsed earlier stepping out of the void.

Gu Jianxin’s eyes brightened; the left and right Sword Sevants also regarded Yang Kai with curious and grateful gazes.

Had Yang Kai not suddenly burst onto the scene, they did not care whether the two of them lived or died, but the Young Master would certainly have been in grave danger. For Yang Kai’s lifesaving effort, the Servants were full of gratitude and looked upon him with nothing but goodwill.

A glance was enough for Gu Jianxin to confirm what he had already probed earlier: Yang Kai was only at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Yet the combat prowess he had shown moments ago was far beyond that stage.

Perhaps even if Gu Jianxin and his two Sword Sevants had combined their strength, they might not have been this man’s match! Gu Jianxin’s heart trembled.

As the Young Alliance Master of the Sword Alliance, he had possessed advantages since childhood that ordinary people could never hope for. Yet he was no idle second-generation heir without ambition — he had lofty ideals and a vast future ahead of him, and for years, he had devoted himself to diligent cultivation.

He had always believed that at the Origin Returning Realm level, across the entire Star Domain, few could rival him!

Yet today he had met one — a peer of equal cultivation who made him feel immense pressure.

“Third Young Master Xue Yue?” Gu Jianxin asked suspiciously.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. “Do I look that effeminate?”

Gu Jianxin gave an embarrassed smile; the Servants also could not help but chuckle. The Left Servants, who had a more coquettish manner, even let out a snort before quickly covering her mouth with a jade hand, as if she sensed the impropriety.

“Apologies — I have long admired Third Young Master Xue Yue from afar but have never met him,” Gu Jianxin explained. “Are you Zi Donglai?”

“Who’s that?” Yang Kai asked, astonished.

“The Purple Star's Young Master…” Gu Jianxin faltered.

“What, are you saying that only the young masters of those great powers have the right to speak with you?” Yang Kai said with a smile, looking at Gu Jianxin.

“I did not mean that,” Gu Jianxin hastened to say earnestly. “It is simply hard for me to imagine someone could be so powerful without backing from a major power; if I was rude, please forgive me.”

“No matter.” Yang Kai grinned. “I am not from any great power. My name is Yang Kai.”

Gu Jianxin was taken aback; he had never heard that name before and was certain Yang Kai was not from any great power — which made Gu Jianxin even more shocked.

He immediately cupped his hands solemnly. “So it is Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and turned his gaze to the distance; there, with Liu Yan’s aid, the battle had apparently been settled. Li Minghai’s men were no match — one by one they had been cut down with none escaping.

“Brother Yang, I have a question,” Gu Jianxin suddenly spoke, “though I’m not sure if it’s appropriate to ask.”

“When I passed through here earlier, Li Minghai ambushed me, so I decided to lay in wait,” Yang Kai glanced at him and answered as if he had foreseen the question.

“Brother Yang, such courage, such spirit, such means!” Gu Jianxin’s brow twitched slightly.

Ordinarily, when an Origin Returning Realm practitioner is surprised by a Void King Realm ambush and only barely survives, they would run as far as possible and vent their anger in private; they would not dare counterattack. Yet this Yang Kai had the nerve to turn and strike back himself.

To act so implies either reckless audacity or the support of some backing.

Judging by the outcome, it was clearly the latter!

It seemed that in the previous fight he had not yet unleashed his full strength.

Furthermore, this fellow was clearly one who never left a grudge unavenged!
