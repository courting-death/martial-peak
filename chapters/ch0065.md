## Chapter 65 — Wei Zhuang

Apart from these two groups, many Lingxiao Pavilion disciples had gathered on the outskirts, eager to watch the spectacle, their numbers considerable as they pointed and whispered among themselves.

Carrying a hint of curiosity, Yang Kai pushed through the crowd and slowly made his way toward Li Yuntian and the others.

Casting a casual glance, he noticed that Su Mu in the arena was now battered and bruised, looking utterly miserable as he fought against a young man not much older than himself. That youth wore an expression of calm confidence, unmarked by even the slightest injury, a contemptuous smile playing on his lips. While deftly countering Su Mu’s attacks, he taunted him with words. Su Mu growled lowly, charging fiercely each time, yet all his efforts were effortlessly deflected.

After watching for a moment, Yang Kai’s brow furrowed slightly. Something was amiss. Su Mu’s attacks were not missing the youth; rather, they simply had no effect. His fists struck the other without causing even a flinch, yet if the youth landed a blow on Su Mu, the latter would surely suffer some injury.

The bursts of Primordial Qi from their moves were roughly equal, indicating their strength was comparable. How then could there be such a disparity in the fight?

“What’s going on?” Yang Kai asked, patting Li Yuntian on the shoulder.

Li Yuntian turned, his expression one of great joy and relief. “Senior Brother Yang!”

At this call, Zhao Hu and the others also noticed Yang Kai and greeted him before turning back to face their opponents.

“Why is Su Mu no match for him?” Yang Kai voiced his confusion. “Their strength should be about the same, right?”

Li Yuntian nodded quickly, his face filled with resentment. “Yes. Su Shao is currently at the second stage of the Open Origin Realm, and that person is at the third stage. Even in a fair fight, Su Shao would struggle, but this man is truly despicable. In a sparring match between fellow disciples, he actually wears a defensive secret treasure. Su Shao’s techniques cannot be fully unleashed.”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened. “A defensive secret treasure?”

“Yes,” Li Yuntian ground his teeth. “He is the direct grandson of the Great Elder, named Wei Zhuang. That defensive secret treasure was bestowed upon him by the Great Elder himself.”

“Another second-generation scion?” Yang Kai’s understanding deepened. Su Mu also had a powerful backer, and Wei Zhuang was the Great Elder’s own grandson. Both had their patrons, their status roughly equal. Just because others dared not challenge Su Mu didn’t mean he was fearless. But to wear a defensive secret treasure in a sparring match among disciples—that was excessive.

“The Great Elder and the Second Elder have always been at odds, and that animosity extends to Su Shao and Wei Zhuang. Now that he’s found an opportunity, he will surely teach Su Shao a harsh lesson,” Li Yuntian said anxiously.

Yang Kai uttered a low “Oh.” “So it’s just petty internal strife.”

“Senior Brother Yang, please find a way to save Su Shao. You know his temper; if this continues, he will be seriously injured,” Li Yuntian pleaded.

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent. “In sparring among fellow disciples, if one lacks skill, one must endure the blows. Are Lingxiao Pavilion disciples afraid of this?”

“But this fight is unfair. Wei Zhuang relies on the power of his secret treasure.”

Yang Kai sneered. “The world has never been fair! The strong devour the weak; the powerful reign supreme. You should have known this long ago.”

Li Yuntian was stunned into silence.

They truly could not intervene in a sparring match between fellow disciples. Although Yang Kai had been fierce in recent days, the sect’s rules were clear. How could they expect him to save Su Mu again, as he had before?

In the arena, Su Mu was already staggering, his moves growing weak. Wei Zhuang laughed loudly, full of pride, patting his chest. “Su Mu, don’t hold back. I’ll stand still here today. If you can hurt me, I’ll admit defeat willingly.”

Su Mu’s eyes were glazed, his fists stained with blood. The defensive secret treasure Wei Zhuang wore not only protected him but also reflected Primordial Qi. Every punch Su Mu threw caused him to absorb most of the force himself, hence the wounds on his fists.

Hearing Wei Zhuang’s arrogant words, Su Mu spat blood and sneered, “If you have the guts, take off that turtle shell of yours. If I don’t beat you to the ground, you’re not my grandson!”

Wei Zhuang’s expression turned cold, his face twisting into a grimace as he sneered, “Bold words! You’ll pay for your insolence!”

Clearly enraged, Wei Zhuang took three quick steps forward and delivered a sweeping punch to Su Mu’s cheek. Weak as he was, Su Mu managed to block, but his strength was insufficient. The blow landed, swelling his cheek instantly and spinning his body halfway around.

Wei Zhuang’s momentum was like a tiger’s. Without hesitation, he kicked Su Mu to the ground and unleashed a barrage of fierce punches.

Su Mu struggled desperately but to no avail. The secret treasure on Wei Zhuang’s body was clearly effective and beyond Su Mu’s ability to break.

“Call me Grandpa, and I might spare you!” Wei Zhuang threatened after a flurry of blows.

Su Mu looked at him coldly, laughing with disdain.

The last time Su Mu had been nearly crushed by Cheng Shaofeng’s stone, he never yielded. How could he submit now?

“I’ll make you regret that!” Wei Zhuang showed no mercy. After several punches, Su Mu’s teeth were shattered, and blood flowed from his nostrils, his appearance pitiful beyond words.

Wei Zhuang’s cruelty surpassed even that of Cheng Shaofeng on that day.

“Su Shao!” Li Yuntian and the others could no longer bear to watch. They stepped forward, but the sect’s rules forbade them from intervening.

Wei Zhuang ceased his assault and sneered at Li Yuntian and the others. “Want to save him?”

They said nothing, panting heavily, their faces filled with righteous indignation.

“I ask again, do you want to save him?” Wei Zhuang slapped Su Mu’s face and asked viciously.

Seeing Su Mu attacked again, Li Yuntian and the others hurriedly nodded, fearing further torment.

“Then kneel! Bow your heads a few times. If I’m in a good mood, I might spare him today!” Wei Zhuang, unable to break Su Mu, turned his cruelty toward Li Yuntian and the others. After all, these men were Su Mu’s followers. Humiliating them was humiliating Su Mu.

At these words, the crowd erupted in uproar. Li Yuntian and the others’ faces turned pale with shame and humiliation.

Su Mu struggled, glaring at Li Yuntian and the others, his eyes bloodshot as he spoke slowly and clearly, “Don’t listen to him!”

With a sharp slap, Su Mu was struck again.

Li Yuntian and the others were shocked. Knowing that hesitation would only bring more suffering to Su Mu, they looked at Wei Zhuang with bitter sorrow and slowly knelt down.

Yang Kai watched them in surprise. He had not expected them to go to such lengths for Su Mu. The saying “a man’s knees are worth gold” rang true. Without deep bonds, who would kneel for another?

He had thought Li Yuntian and the others were merely riding on Su Mu’s coattails, but now it was clear they were different.

Wei Zhuang’s eyes narrowed as he chuckled, looking down on Su Mu from above. “I didn’t expect your pack of dogs to be so obedient.”

Two lines of tears traced down Su Mu’s face in humiliation. Though beaten to a pulp, he had not shed a single tear before. But now, seeing Li Yuntian and the others kneeling, those tears fell uncontrollably.
