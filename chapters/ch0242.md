## Chapter 242 — He Has a Hidden Condition...

In the next moment, Yang Kai, enveloped in black aura, grinned at them, his smile wicked and revealing a mouth full of sharp, white fangs that appeared exceptionally sinister against the backdrop of the black aura.

Staring at those eyes and that evil smile, Zi Mo and Leng Shan both froze in place, their True Yuan involuntarily calming down, not daring to show the slightest hint of hostility.

"You..." Zi Mo's brows knitted tightly, unable to comprehend whether Yang Kai had truly fallen into Qi Deviation.

"It's time to give you some punishment!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, pushing his hands forward. The White Tiger Seal and Divine Ox Seal unleashed their power, and two beast souls appeared.

Unlike the beast souls formed from True Yang Yuan Qi, these two beast souls were pitch black, just like Yang Kai himself, filled with evil energy and mystery.

With a roar, the two beast souls lunged at them from left and right, pinning the two women directly to the ground.

"We were wrong! We thought you had fallen into Qi Deviation!" Zi Mo cried out in terror. Although her strength was much higher than that of the beast souls, she still dared not resist, not wanting to endure the pain of having her soul tormented again.

"Even if I had fallen into Qi Deviation, would that give you an opportunity?" Yang Kai sneered. If he hadn't seen through their thoughts, he wouldn't have been so polite to them.

Their current actions were merely driven by self-preservation.

With a thought, the two beast souls dissipated, and the two women hurriedly scrambled to their feet, filled with fear and trepidation.

Looking at them with a faint smile, Yang Kai said, "You can escape death, but you can't escape living punishment. Speak for yourselves; what punishment do you deserve?"

Zi Mo shivered, biting her lip as she said, "As long as you don't torment my soul, anything is fine!"

"Really?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Yes." Zi Mo nodded vigorously. Being tormented in soul was worse than death; it was the most vicious form of torture in the world.

"And you?" Yang Kai glanced at Leng Shan.

"I... I feel the same..." Leng Shan stammered.

Yang Kai coldly stared at the two, suddenly chuckling, "Then... take off your clothes."

Upon hearing this, both women trembled.

Zi Mo quickly regained her composure, then smiled coyly, unfastening her top and slowly removing it. Her eyes sparkled with allure, containing boundless charm.

On the contrary, Leng Shan's body stiffened, completely at a loss.

"You don't have to take them off. Three rounds of torment until you you lose consciousness, your choice." Yang Kai said coldly.

Recalling that kind of pain, Leng Shan felt a chill run through her body. After a long while, she closed her eyes, letting tears fall, and fiercely said, "If one day I regain my freedom, I will make you pay back double!"

Yang Kai laughed heartily, "I'll be waiting!"

As each piece of clothing was removed, the graceful figures of the two women quickly came into Yang Kai's view. Both Zi Mo and Leng Shan were exceptionally beautiful, with alluring figures; their appearances were stunning, and their bodies were voluptuous and curvaceous.

Yang Kai shamelessly swept his gaze over them, secretly comparing, his eyes blazing with fire, his lower abdomen heating up.

Soon, both were left in only their thin undergarments—one a bright red bandeau, the other a light purple bandeau. The flimsy garments could hardly conceal their boundless allure, with two crimson protrusions resembling grapes pressing against the fabric below, petite and clearly defined.

Below, the view was even more dazzling. The lush grass was half-concealed, veiled in a hazy mist, indistinct yet tantalizing — stirring boundless imagination.

Except for the most crucial parts, the exquisite beauty of the two women was imprinted in Yang Kai's eyes.

"Do you want to take off more?" Zi Mo asked softly, biting her lip, her face flushed.

Yang Kai merely intended to teach them a lesson and did not wish to go too far.

He had realized that Zi Mo was bold and unrestrained, while Leng Shan held a more conservative view. If he went too far, she might not be able to handle it.

After indulging his eyes, Yang Kai waved his hand and said, "Get lost!"

Zi Mo was stunned, and Leng Shan opened her eyes, looking at Yang Kai with uncertainty. Both women thought they were destined to face calamity this time, yet the man before them, filled with evil energy, merely glanced at them and let them go.

After a moment of thought, Zi Mo suddenly pursed her lips and looked meaningfully at Yang Kai's lower body, her eyes filled with understanding as she giggled.

In the face of such alluring beauty, aside from true gentlemen who remain unmoved, there is only one type of person who would be indifferent.

So he...

Hehe...

In that instant, a wave of delight surged within Zi Mo, and she couldn't help but want to laugh, her delicate shoulders trembling, yet she held it in with great difficulty.

"What are you still standing there for? I’ll count to three. If you don’t leave, don’t think you can escape!" Yang Kai, unaware of Zi Mo's expression, threatened with a furrowed brow.

Leng Shan felt as if she had been granted a reprieve from a dream and quickly bent down.

"Leave your clothes; get out!" Yang Kai said lightly.

With resentment and grievance, Leng Shan shot Yang Kai a glance before covering her crucial parts and fleeing like the wind.

Zi Mo, however, was unhurried, lazily stretching her body, revealing her enchanting figure without reservation, and threw another flirtatious glance at Yang Kai before turning around, swaying her serpentine waist, and departing gracefully, her shapely rear swaying enticingly.

Watching the two women disappear behind a large tree, Yang Kai finally closed his eyes, suppressing the surging emotions within him.

He actually didn't mind having a passionate encounter with Zi Mo; after all, she seemed quite open-minded. If he truly took her body, she probably wouldn't care too much.

However, they were enemies after all, and once things escalated to an irreconcilable point, it could lead to a life-and-death confrontation.

Moreover, last time on Hidden Island, he had managed to elevate his Realm significantly by resisting his inner desires, so this time he wanted to suppress himself as well.

When it came to strength and women, Yang Kai still leaned towards the former.

As Yang Kai suppressed himself and elevated his Realm, behind the tree, Leng Shan and Zi Mo concealed themselves, exchanging silent glances.

This time, their ambush had failed, and instead, that brat had taken full advantage, making them suffer a great loss!

Furious, Leng Shan's eyes brimmed with killing intent as she picked up a withered blade of grass from the ground and twisted it fiercely, cursing, "Bastard, beast! Bullying weak women, what kind of thing is that? The humiliation of today, I will make him pay back double one day!"

Zi Mo remained silent for a long while before bitterly smiling, "In front of him, we aren't really weak women, are we? His strength is lower than ours. Moreover, we were the ones who plotted against him first; he merely issued a small warning. It's just a few glances, and he hasn't truly done anything to you."

Leng Shan shot Zi Mo a cold glare, resentfully saying, "You don't care at all?"

"Hehe..." Zi Mo suddenly burst into laughter, her eyes crescent-shaped, "If it were another man, I might care. But him... letting him see more is fine."

"Hmph. It seems you've already given up on yourself." Leng Shan looked at her with disdain.

Zi Mo was unbothered and waved her hand, "Let me tell you a secret. You won't care too much after you know."

"What secret?" Leng Shan asked suspiciously.

Zi Mo leaned in closer and whispered a few words.

After hearing this, Leng Shan's face turned a mix of red and green, and soon her eyes revealed a hint of glee and delight.

"You mean... he can't perform?" Leng Shan asked, barely holding back her laughter.

"Shh. Why say it out loud? Just knowing is enough." Zi Mo placed a finger over Leng Shan's lips.

"How do you know?" Leng Shan asked curiously, feeling a sense of closeness to Zi Mo for the first time, leaning in closer.

"We both almost stripped down, and he remained unmoved. What other explanation could there be besides being impotent?" Zi Mo covered her mouth, "If it were any other man, they would probably be unable to resist the temptation of you and me. So, he must have a hidden ailment!"

Leng Shan nodded involuntarily, her face filled with agreement.

"This is a major taboo for any man!" Zi Mo seemed to understand quite a bit, as she and Leng Shan leaned their heads together, whispering, "We must never mention it in front of him, or it would surely lead to disaster."

"Yes, I won't bring it up." Leng Shan nodded repeatedly, then added, "But if he has this kind of ailment, what you said about seducing him... wouldn't that be impossible?"

Zi Mo chuckled, "Precisely because he has an ailment, we must seduce him! We can't do anything to him now, but by seducing him, we can watch him suffer without being able to vent. Isn't that also a form of revenge?"

Leng Shan suddenly understood, her face lighting up with eagerness. She looked at Zi Mo with admiration, "You know so much."

Zi Mo shot her a playful glare, "Little girl, the women of Tianlang Kingdom are not as conservative as you Great Han women."

"Then you... with men..." Leng Shan's face turned red as she spoke.

Zi Mo also felt a bit shy and embarrassed, "No! I haven't met a man who can conquer me yet."

Leng Shan scoffed, "I don't believe you!"

...

After two consecutive days of meditation and cultivation, Yang Kai first resisted the temptations and disturbances within his heart, significantly improving his Realm. He then practiced the Slave Beast Seal again. Although he still couldn't merge the White Tiger Seal and Divine Ox Seal every time, he finally found a sense of feeling, becoming much more proficient than before.

During these two days, Yang Kai expended an immense amount of energy, but the energy stored within his Proud Bone Golden Body was also unfathomably deep, so such consumption posed no burden at all.

At this moment, Zi Mo and Leng Shan were sitting among a group of Demonic Beasts, still only wearing their undergarments.

Yang Kai's punishment for them was not yet over.

Their strength was not low, so they naturally did not fear the cold, but their current appearance was too humiliating. Thus, Zi Mo had surrounded herself and Leng Shan with layers of Demonic Beasts, shielding their allure from view.

Over these two days, the two women discussed how to take revenge on Yang Kai, making him suffer unbearably. As they chatted, they grew united in their animosity, becoming much closer.

As Yang Kai's voice came from nearby, Zi Mo was taken aback, then let out a sigh of relief, "He still has a bit of conscience."

While speaking, she gestured for two Demonic Beasts to run out and retrieve their clothes.

When the two women finally dressed and walked over to Yang Kai, he casually opened his eyes as if nothing had happened.

The two women were secretly astonished. This young man before them had squandered an unimaginable amount of Yuan Qi over the past few days, even showing signs of falling into Qi Deviation, yet now he appeared as if nothing had changed, showing no signs of fatigue.

A mysterious man, the two women thought.
