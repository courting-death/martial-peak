## Chapter 2138 — Flame Beast

The man and woman from that unknown small sect were stopped by an invisible barrier the moment they tried to rush into the entrance of the Four Seasons Land, unable to enter.

Not only that, the barrier blocking them contained a savage, destructive power that instantly shredded them into a mass of flesh and blood mist, exploding in midair.

The two of them died just like that, without even knowing why!

“Ah?”

“How could this happen?”

Below, many martial artists cried out in shock, their faces turning deathly pale.

If the entrance to the Four Seasons Land was this dangerous, how could they enter? Most of those present probably wouldn’t make it through and would die right here.

But most of the Dao Origin Realm experts remained calm, as if they had expected this.

Yang Kai sighed softly.

Having received the jade slip from Qingyang Shrine, he knew those two had acted recklessly. To enter the Four Seasons Land, you couldn’t force your way in—no matter how strong you were, you’d end up like them, dead and without a corpse.

To enter the Four Seasons Land, you could only wait for a mysterious power to guide you in.

That was the benefit of having information.

If Yang Kai had come here alone and ignorant, he might have rushed in and triggered unpredictable consequences.

Just then, a transparent energy sphere floated out from the crack, like a bubble, quietly suspended in midair.

As soon as the energy sphere appeared, the disciples from Star God Palace sprang into action.

Of the forty disciples, ten entered the bubble one after another. The bubble twisted and changed shape but never burst, looking truly miraculous.

Strangely, the bubble seemed just big enough for ten people to stand inside. Once ten Dao Origin Realm experts entered, there was barely any space left, and at the same time, the bubble contracted slightly and floated rapidly toward the entrance.

In the next moment, it slipped inside the entrance and vanished.

Seeing this, the martial artists participating in the Four Seasons Land for the first time finally understood what was happening.

Clearly, the bubble was the key to entering the Four Seasons Land.

After a few breaths, another bubble floated out from the crack, and Star God Palace sent out another ten disciples...

This repeated four times before all the Star God Palace disciples had entered.

Star God Palace was the overlord of the Southern Territory, so no one objected to them entering first. No one knew how the Emperor Realm experts decided the order, but after Star God Palace, Tianwu Sacred Land’s twenty disciples split into two groups and entered the Four Seasons Land in turn.

Qingyang Shrine was third in line.

When it was Qingyang Shrine’s turn, Xia Sheng led the way, picking nine others to enter the secret realm with him, guided by the mysterious bubble.

Yang Kai followed with the remaining nine.

The bubble was truly wondrous. When Yang Kai entered, he felt no resistance—rather, it was like falling into water, soft all around, but without any sense of suffocation.

Wrapped in the bubble and passing through the void crack, he felt no danger at all.

His vision blurred, and when Yang Kai came to, he was already in a different place.

The ten were still wrapped in the bubble, floating in midair. Soon, the bubble burst and vanished, and everyone quickly circulated their Qi to remain suspended.

According to the jade slip’s information, Yang Kai knew that each group guided into the Four Seasons Land by a bubble would appear in the same place, but the location for each batch was unpredictable.

So, the ten were still together, but looking around, there was no sign of other martial artists. No one knew where the dozens who entered before had been sent.

This second group of ten from Qingyang Shrine was led by Xiao Baiyi, who had ranked second in the sect’s martial contest, just behind Xia Sheng.

This had been agreed upon beforehand, with him and Xia Sheng each leading a team.

As soon as the bubble burst, Xiao Baiyi took out a Transmission Compass from his Spatial Ring, poured Divine Sense into it, seemingly trying to see if Xia Sheng’s group was nearby.

But after waiting a while, there was no response, so Xiao Baiyi had to put the Transmission Compass away.

“This should be the Summer Domain, right?” Murong Xiaoxiao, who had been scouting the surroundings, suddenly spoke up.

The place where everyone appeared was blazing hot, the air thick with fire element energy, the temperature extremely high, the ground cracked and vegetation sparse—clearly the famous Summer Domain.

“It should be.” Xiao Baiyi nodded gently. He was about to say more when his expression changed and he turned to look in one direction.

At the same time, Yang Kai’s face darkened and he called out, “Something’s coming!”

Xiao Baiyi glanced at him in surprise, secretly impressed by Yang Kai’s keen senses.

“What do you mean?” Murong Xiaoxiao asked suspiciously.

There was no need for Yang Kai to explain. Just as she finished speaking, a distant rumbling sounded, as if some giant creature was charging toward them.

The ground shook with its steps.

Everyone was startled and quietly circulated their Origin Qi, preparing for battle.

The sound grew louder and closer, the ground shaking more and more.

Less than ten breaths after Yang Kai spoke, several streaks of light suddenly appeared ahead, racing toward them.

The leading streak was red and white, dazzling, and radiated a familiar, intimidating aura.

“Wuchang!” Xiao Baiyi’s face darkened. He hadn’t expected to encounter this scourge from Tianwu Sacred Land right after entering the Four Seasons Land.

He’d witnessed Wuchang’s clash with Xia Sheng earlier and considered him a formidable enemy. If he faced Wuchang alone, his chances of victory were less than thirty percent. Now, Wuchang and several Tianwu Sacred Land elites were charging straight toward him, and Xiao Baiyi’s nerves instantly tensed.

Because of the earlier fight with Xia Sheng, Wuchang was now an enemy of Qingyang Shrine. If he started a massacre now, Xiao Baiyi wasn’t confident he could stop him.

As he cursed inwardly, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed and he called out, “They’re not coming for us—something’s chasing them!”

“Wuchang is being chased?” a male martial artist in the group exclaimed, his face changing.

Wuchang was already a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert and the top rising star of Tianwu Sacred Land. For him to flee in panic, his pursuer must be at least Emperor Realm.

The Four Seasons Land wasn’t without such beings. Over the years, many martial artists who entered had died at their hands, unable to resist at all.

As they spoke, the thing chasing Wuchang and the others came into view. About a hundred zhang behind Wuchang, a creature over ten zhang tall, wrapped in blazing flames with crimson eyes, charged across the ground, trailing a long red light.

Each leap seemed to ignore the limits of space, instantly covering dozens of zhang, shaking the earth.

“Flame Beast!” Xiao Baiyi’s face went pale as he cried out, “This is the Flame Beast’s territory!”

The jade slip from Qingyang Shrine had mentioned the Flame Beast of the Summer Domain—a genuine Twelfth-Tier Demonic Beast, capable of Emperor Realm strength.

The Flame Beast’s territory was listed as forbidden in the jade slip, disciples were not allowed to visit lightly.

No one expected their luck to be so bad, to be guided straight into the Flame Beast’s domain.

But it seemed Wuchang and his group were even less fortunate, probably appearing right near the Flame Beast’s lair and triggering this deadly chase.

The Flame Beast, unable to catch Wuchang and the others, let out a furious roar. With the roar, a fiery red beam shot from its mouth.

Space was instantly pierced, the fiery beam’s destructive power unimaginable, spanning over ten li.

Wuchang reacted quickly. Sensing the killing intent behind him, he paused and shot upward, narrowly dodging the deadly attack. But the others weren’t so lucky.

One Tianwu Sacred Land disciple failed to dodge and was struck by the beam, reduced to ashes without even a scream.

Another disciple’s arm was grazed, instantly melted away, and he let out a world-shaking cry.

“Run!” Yang Kai shouted, immediately summoning his Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade wooden boat, stepping aboard and urging his Origin Qi. The boat shot away like the wind.

With his warning, the nine stunned Qingyang Shrine disciples finally came to their senses, each summoning their own Secret Treasures and fleeing in streaks of light away from the Flame Beast.

It wasn’t that their wills were weak—the Tianwu Sacred Land disciple had died too suddenly.

That was a top disciple of Tianwu Sacred Land, not some nobody from a minor sect. In other words, the dead martial artist was on the same level as them.

He vanished without a sound.

If they were in his place, they’d meet the same fate.

So that scene had a huge impact on their eyes and hearts...

Following Yang Kai, the nine fled with all their might, not even thinking of fighting the Flame Beast. With their strength, they couldn’t possibly win—recklessness meant death.

At this moment, the remaining Tianwu Sacred Land disciples also flew not far behind.

Still, they were quick-witted; seeing another group to bear the brunt, they immediately scattered and sped off in different directions.

But the Flame Beast didn’t care which sect anyone belonged to. In its eyes, anyone trespassing in its territory had to die, so it kept chasing relentlessly.
