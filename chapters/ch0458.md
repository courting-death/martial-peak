## Chapter 458 — Liu Qingyao

Gazing at the two figures receding into the distance, Liu Qingyao’s brow furrowed slightly, his face filled with disdain as he slowly shook his head. “Relying on outside help is ultimately not true skill.”

Though he spoke thus, his speed suddenly surged, clearly unwilling to fall behind.

Fifty li was not a great distance; within just over half the time it took to burn an incense stick, the three arrived one after another at the shore of Po Jing Lake.

Yang Kai landed to the east, Yang Zhao to the west, while Liu Qingyao dared to place himself squarely in the middle.

Only now did Yang Kai have the time to properly size up this reputed First Young Master of Zhongdu!

Clad in plain blue robes, neither ostentatious nor vulgar, he looked young, no more than twenty-six or twenty-seven years old. His build was slender and sword-like, not burly, yet his body held a power no one could overlook. His expression was indifferent, as though worldly matters did not concern him, yet his eyes revealed an overbearing, unyielding aura.

This aura of invincibility was not a show of conceit, but a natural radiance born of being at the pinnacle for years—a man who stood atop the clouds, forever looking down upon the world.

He was no pushover. Just a slight perception from Yang Kai made this clear.

Though his Realm was only Divine Roaming Realm Third Stage, he was definitively not an ordinary martial artist at this level. His true power could only be known through combat.

Recalling the bold words this man had previously spoken, Yang Kai smiled faintly. This subtle action caught Liu Qingyao’s attention. His bright yet somewhat listless eyes immediately fixed onto Yang Kai, and his Divine Sense swept over him without restraint.

Yang Kai’s brow tightened, his expression growing displeased.

Though the other’s action posed no real threat and was not hostile, blatantly probing another’s Divine Sense was an unwritten taboo.

Such behavior could very well spark unnecessary disputes or battles. People usually refrained from such acts; Liu Qingyao did so simply because he did not care much for Yang Kai.

Sure enough, after sweeping his Divine Sense, Liu Qingyao ceased paying any attention to him, standing there alone and conspicuously prominent.

No one knew why he had come this time.

At the shore of Po Jing Lake, a group had already arrived early. They belonged to First Brother Yang Wei. Upon seeing Yang Kai and Yang Zhao, he simply nodded faintly, then cast a sharp glance at Liu Qingyao. A slight ripple of True Essence stirred within him.

Rumor had it that after Yang Wei returned to Zhongdu, he had once fought a fierce battle with Liu Qingyao. But the outcome of that battle was unknown to anyone.

Now that the two met again, sparks were bound to fly.

“You’ve already reached Divine Roaming Realm Second Stage. Eldest Young Master, your cultivation speed is astonishing!” Unexpectedly, Liu Qingyao took the initiative to greet Yang Wei.

“Thanks to Young Master Liu’s favor, that battle allowed me to gain many insights,” Yang Wei replied calmly.

Liu Qingyao nodded lightly, his tone indifferent. “If you wish to gain more insight, I shall be waiting at any time.”

The expressions of Yang Kai and Yang Zhao suddenly grew strange. Although far apart, they exchanged glances and saw the deep meaning in each other’s eyes.

These two had spoken but a few words, yet those words carried intriguing implications.

It seemed the rumors were true: Yang Wei had been defeated by Liu Qingyao in that battle, and very likely defeated soundly! Otherwise, why else would Liu Qingyao speak so arrogantly?

Yet Liu Qingyao’s arrogance did not anger Yang Wei. His expression remained unchanged, and he only nodded, saying, “I shall come. I hope Young Master Liu will not be too surprised then!”

Liu Qingyao shook his head slowly, “I will not be surprised, because you are no match for me!”

At these words, Yang Wei’s allies behind him grew indignant, all glaring furiously at Liu Qingyao.

To belittle their master before their very eyes was intolerable.

Yang Wei still showed no signs of anger, simply raising his hand to quell the agitation beside him and loudly declared, “That I am not your match now does not mean this will always be so. Even if I am not your match in the future, it does not mean no one from the Yang Family is. Young Master Liu, I am not the strongest among the young generation of the Yang Family, but I know that you are the strongest of the Liu Family. The limits of your Liu Family lie within you, but the limits of our Yang Family remain unknown.”

At last, Liu Qingyao’s expression shifted, interest flickering across his face. “Is there someone stronger than you among the young generation of the Yang Family?”

After a pause, his gaze turned suddenly to Yang Zhao. “Is it Second Young Master?”

“Hey hey…” Yang Zhao could not help but chuckle bitterly. “Young Master Liu jest. Compared to First Brother, I am no match. You talk among yourselves; don’t count me in.”

Liu Qingyao chuckled softly, “If not Second Young Master, then who? Among the direct lineage young generation of the Yang Family, only your Eldest and Second Young Masters are a bit stronger. The others…” He shook his head slowly, casting a glance at Yang Kai but paying him no mind.

Always meticulous and solitary, Yang Wei suddenly burst into laughter aloud. “Young Master Liu, if you cannot see it, then it means you truly are no match for him.”

Liu Qingyao’s expression tightened as he looked into the distance at Yang Wei, puzzled why he was so certain. After careful thought, he truly could not pinpoint anyone in the Yang Family who could best him.

If such a person existed yet he failed to sense it, then that person was truly terrifying indeed.

To deceive his eyes was already a feat worthy of respect.

“Eldest Young Master, I hope what you say is true,” Liu Qingyao said gravely.

“You shall see for yourself!” Yang Wei nodded lightly.

Yang Kai watched quietly without intervening, but he felt Yang Wei’s gaze covertly drifting toward him several times.

Has Eldest Brother noticed something? Yang Kai wondered in secret.

After a while, Huo Xingchen arrived with a large contingent. Similarly, Yang Zhao’s forces also gathered around him.

As more arrived, Yang Zhao visibly relaxed, letting his guard down. Earlier, he had clearly been worried that Yang Wei might take advantage of his solitude.

Though always protected by a Blood Servant, coming so recklessly was still dangerous.

By mid-morning, the crowd at Po Jing Lake had grown larger. Yang Kang, Yang Shen, and Yang Ying also arrived one after another with their people.

After this long period of recruitment and preparation, the strength each of the six brothers commanded could be easily discerned at a glance.

The first arrivals brought roughly equally numerous forces. Even if there were some differences in strength, they were not obvious. The later three, however, were distinctly weaker. Though each had disciples from the Eight Great Families as allies, their own charisma and connections were lacking, making it hard to gather much support.

Noticing this, Yang Kang and the others’ expressions abruptly darkened.

Because even Yang Kai—whom all had earlier believed would not last the night—had now pulled ahead of them.

If this continued, the situation would only worsen.

All three silently resolved to accelerate their recruitment efforts once they returned—at the very least, they could not let Yang Kai outpace them.

Not only were the six Yang brothers gathered around Po Jing Lake, but curious martial artists from within War City had also formed a large ring around the area.

These onlookers sensibly kept their distance, staying three li outside the lake, watching from afar.

No one was foolish enough to risk their life. With so many formidable warriors assembled, getting caught up in the chaos could spell a death without even knowing how.

Among those in the crowd were the pair of sisters who had been at the inn earlier, standing far off, gazing toward where Yang Kai stood.

Months of absence had seen this man grow much stronger, likely aided by his change in status. Now, he seemed more charismatic and aggressive than before.

One sister’s eyes shimmered with a strange light; a bewitching expression bloomed on her face as she looked toward him. This mood evidently affected the other sister, making her heartbeat quicken.

Biting her lip, she took a deep breath, chest rising and falling, and gave a helpless smile.

This was a torment indeed. After cultivating that divine art, the two sisters’ feelings had gradually aligned. Influenced by her younger sister’s preferences, she too was affected.

From time to time, she would think of that man’s figure but was too shy to show it before her sister, feeling intensely restrained.

Though she had arrived at War City long ago, she still lacked the courage to face him. Hiding in the inn a li from his estate, she often gazed out the window, hoping to catch a glimpse of him leaving. But he never appeared.

Only now, with this rare chance to see him, she almost missed it by restraining herself.

Thinking of her own duplicity, the woman felt a touch of self-loathing. Unlike her sister, who plainly displayed her feelings, she hid hers completely.

“Hey, aren’t you going to help him?” the man from before asked with a light laugh.

“Help how? There’s only three of us. What can we do in such a large scene?”

“Ah, that’s why women and scoundrels are hard to support! I shouldn’t have come with just you three!” The man was frustrated. Had he known it would be such a major event, he would have brought everyone from the inn. But now, it was only three people, all at True Essence Realm, which really wasn’t much help.

Time flowed slowly, everyone secretly waiting for the arrival of the treasures, while speculating how the Yang Family planned to distribute the thousand relics here.

Yang Kai watched attentively, his mighty Divine Sense overwhelming all others, checking constantly for any movement around.

Hidden among the onlookers were many experts! Realizing this, Yang Kai shuddered inwardly. These masters were not mere spectators; they were likely warriors sent by the Eight Great Families to observe the situation.

At the bottom of Po Jing Lake, subtle energy fluctuations also emanated. These delicate ripples were difficult even for Yang Kai to detect, let alone the others.

It seemed some treasures had long been arranged beneath the lake, waiting for the appointed time to appear.
