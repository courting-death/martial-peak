## Chapter 2458 — Heavenly Wolf Valley of the Eastern Territory

After traveling for a while through the Void Passage with Lan He, Yang Kai suddenly stopped in his tracks.

Lan He didn’t know what had happened and didn’t dare interrupt. She simply stood quietly to the side.

After a moment, Yang Kai spoke, “This place is relatively safe—the space here is quite stable. Miss Lan He, rest here for a while. I need to tend to my wounds. Once I’ve recovered, I’ll send you out.”

“Send me out…” Lan He was stunned, but recalling how Yang Kai had rescued her so easily before, she was instantly filled with confidence in him. She nodded, “Alright, don’t worry about me. Focus on healing as soon as possible. The corrosive power of that Shura Earth Fiend is extremely strong—the longer you delay, the worse it will be.”

Yang Kai extended his hand, weaving the power of space through the air around Lan He. “I’ve left spatial marks here,” he explained. “If anything happens, I’ll sense it immediately and come right away.”

After saying this, he turned and darted off to a spot not far away.

Once Yang Kai left, Lan He finally sat down cross-legged, released her Divine Sense to check the surroundings, and found that, just as Yang Kai had said, the space here was indeed stable, without the strange force she’d encountered before. She didn’t dare to move around and could only wait here.

Not far away, Yang Kai also sat down cross-legged. He took out a large handful of healing pills from his Spatial Ring and stuffed them into his mouth like beans.

His injuries weren’t too serious now. The wounds from the Mountain and River Bell’s shock were already healing rapidly. The only real trouble was the Shura Earth Fiend, which clung to his arm like maggots on bones.

He had to circulate his Origin Qi to force the Earth Fiend's power out of his body.

Fortunately, his Origin Qi was vast and pure. Even though this secret technique was formidable, it couldn’t withstand his expulsion.

Time passed little by little. Yang Kai gradually forced out and dispersed the power of the Shura Earth Fiend, his expression focused and his actions methodical.

After about five or six days, he finally let out a heavy breath.

The Shura Earth Fiend had completely disappeared, though the corrosive wounds on his arm hadn’t fully healed. But with his strong physique and recovery ability, such injuries were nothing to him.

Five or six days of recovery also healed the injuries he’d suffered from the Mountain and River Bell’s shock.

Yang Kai shook his arm, slowly stood up, and walked toward where Lan He was.

Soon, he arrived at Lan He’s side. He found her still sitting cross-legged in the same spot, and the spatial marks he’d set up earlier hadn’t been disturbed, indicating that everything had been peaceful here these past few days, with no interference from the void’s power.

Sensing Yang Kai’s arrival, Lan He also stood up and asked, “Brother Yang, are you alright?”

“There’s no problem now,” Yang Kai replied with a smile.

“That’s good!” Lan He breathed a sigh of relief. After a pause, she asked, “So can we leave now?”

Yang Kai said, “Of course. Come, I’ll send you out.”

Hearing the implication in his words, Lan He was surprised. “What about you? Are you staying behind?”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, full of confidence. “I’m very familiar with this place. There’s no danger for me. I want to look for the Mountain and River Bell—it also escaped into this Void Passage. Who knows where it ended up.”

“I see!” Lan He knew she couldn’t persuade him further, since she wasn’t that close to Yang Kai anyway. “Then I wish Brother Yang success.”

“Thank you for your kind words.” Yang Kai grinned.

“Oh, right.” Lan He suddenly remembered something and said, “Didn’t you say you had something to ask of me?”

Reminded by her, Yang Kai also recalled and slapped his forehead. “That’s right. I have a friend who set out from the Northern Territory over a year ago, heading to your Heavenly Wolf Valley.”

“Brother Yang’s friend? Are they joining my Heavenly Wolf Valley? But why would they set out from the Northern Territory?” Lan He was very surprised.

If they were a martial artist from the Northern Territory, they should have chosen a sect in the Northern Territory first. There’s no reason to travel all the way to the Eastern Territory. After all, the distance between the two territories is immense. Without using a cross-territory Space Array, it could take years to get there.

“It’s a bit of a complicated story. Let’s talk as we walk.” Yang Kai called out, leading Lan He to search for a weak spot in the space while explaining.

The friend he mentioned was, of course, Ling Yinqin.

Previously, when the Holy Son Chang Hao of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land mentioned Heavenly Wolf Valley, Yang Kai had felt that he’d heard of this sect somewhere before, but couldn’t recall exactly. Only after a sudden flash of insight did the memory finally surface.

Ling Yinqin had mentioned the Heavenly Wolf Valley to him before.

Ling Yinqin’s late husband had been a disciple of the Heavenly Wolf Valley in the Eastern Territory! The two had met and fallen in love in the Jixu Secret Realm, later marrying. But her husband had died saving her, and Ling Yinqin still mourned him to this day.

The set of high-grade Purification Arrays Ling Yinqin had lent Yang Kai back then had been bought by her husband at great expense and was a token of her longing. That’s why, after the Purification Array was damaged, Yang Kai had gone to great lengths to ask Sangde to repair it, which led to many subsequent events.

When Ling Yinqin left the Jixu Secret Realm, she brought her husband’s ashes with her. The last time they parted in the Northern Territory, Ling Yinqin said she wanted to take the ashes to Heavenly Wolf Valley so her husband could rest in peace.

After briefly explaining Ling Yinqin and her husband’s story to Lan He, Lan He was deeply moved. “Miss Ling must be a devoted woman.”

If not for deep devotion, how could she willingly travel from the Northern Territory to the Eastern Territory just to return her husband’s ashes to his sect? The journey was not only long but also fraught with danger—one misstep could mean death.

“Big Sister Ling is a very good person,” Yang Kai said solemnly.

“What was her husband’s name? If he really was a disciple of the Heavenly Wolf Valley, I might have heard of him,” Lan He asked.

Yang Kai shook his head. “Big Sister Ling never mentioned that.”

“That’s alright. If I get to meet her, I’ll just ask,” Lan He didn’t press the issue.

Yang Kai said, “Big Sister Ling is deeply devoted to her husband. From the look of her, even after returning his ashes, she probably won’t want to leave his side. But since she’s not a disciple of Heavenly Wolf Valley, the sect might not let her stay long. I’d like to ask you, Miss Lan, if you ever meet her, please look after her. If possible, help her join Heavenly Wolf Valley as a disciple. If not, at least let her visit her husband’s grave often to ease her longing.”

“Since Brother Yang asks, of course it’s no problem,” Lan He agreed readily.

Yang Kai was overjoyed. “With your promise, I’m relieved.”

Lan He was the Senior Sister of the Heavenly Wolf Valley, a status far above ordinary disciples. Since she agreed, she would surely do it. Though her looks and figure were average, she had a heroic spirit that rivaled any man.

“What’s Big Sister Ling’s current cultivation?”

“Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Her strength isn’t the very best, but it’s definitely not weak,” Yang Kai said objectively.

“Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm?” Lan He’s eyes lit up. She clapped her hands. “Then joining our Heavenly Wolf Valley won’t be a problem at all. If she were a stranger, there might be some tests, but since Brother Yang recommended her, we can skip those. I’ll tell my master when I return.”

“Thank you very much!” Yang Kai couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. Although he and Ling Yinqin weren’t that close, they had at least come out of the Jixu Secret Realm together.

With her cultivation, she could have joined Ice Heart Valley back then, and Bing Yun had wanted to keep her. But she was trapped by love and only wanted to go to Heavenly Wolf Valley, so everyone let her be.

If she can join the Heavenly Wolf Valley in the future, it would be a good place for her. She’d have the backing of a sect and could stay with her husband’s grave. Ling Yinqin surely wouldn’t refuse.

As they spoke, Yang Kai suddenly stopped, and Lan He also halted.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to check the surroundings. “This is the place. In a moment, I’ll tear open space. Miss Lan He, just go out without worry—there’s no danger.”

“Alright.” Lan He nodded and cupped her fists. “Brother Yang, be careful. If you ever get the chance, you must come visit me at Heavenly Wolf Valley.”

“Definitely!” Yang Kai replied.

After speaking, his expression turned serious. He reached out and thrust his hand into the void ahead.

The Power of Space surged, the Laws of Space fluctuated instantly, and the Void Passage twisted and became unstable in a flash.

Lan He’s expression changed slightly. She held her breath and didn’t dare disturb him at all.

“Open!” Yang Kai shouted, and suddenly spread his hands to both sides. Under Lan He’s shocked gaze, the void ahead split open like a piece of silk, revealing a crack in an instant.

And as Yang Kai moved, the crack grew wider and wider.

Lan He’s eyes trembled, filled with amazement.

Tearing open the void with bare hands—she’d only ever heard of such an incredible feat, never seen it with her own eyes.

But now, this scene was unfolding clearly before her, leaving her deeply shaken.

Through the crack in the void, Lan He could clearly see the ruined landscape of the Shattered Star Sea on the other side. She immediately understood that passing through this crack would return her to the Shattered Star Sea.

“Go!” Yang Kai shouted.

Lan He didn’t hesitate. Her figure flickered as she rushed toward the crack, and in the blink of an eye, she was on the other side. Looking back, she saw the crack rapidly closing, with Yang Kai standing in the Void Passage, smiling and waving at her.

“Take care, Brother Yang!” Lan He shouted, but the crack had already closed. She didn’t know if Yang Kai had heard her.

Standing there in a daze for a while, Lan He finally sighed, picked a direction, and sped off into the depths of the Shattered Star Sea.

Though her time with Yang Kai had been short, it felt as if a new door had opened before her, showing her just how unimaginably powerful a Dao Origin Realm cultivator could be. The elite disciples of those top sects were as insignificant as ants before someone of the same level—easily killed with a wave of the hand.

She knew she could never reach such heights herself. If she wanted to become stronger, she’d have to break through to the Emperor Realm!

Deep within her heart, an intense desire welled up—to break through as soon as possible and gain even greater strength!
