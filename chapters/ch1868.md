## Chapter 1868 — Earth Vein Crystal and Dragon Scale

The haul had been enormous, but Yang Kai did not find what he truly needed.

He was not anxious, however; instead he turned his attention to the few boxes placed in the most inconspicuous corner.

There were three boxes in total, arranged in a row. If his estimate was correct, the Star Emperor Token should be hidden inside one of them.

The Star Emperor Token was critical to his entering the Star Realm to pursue higher Martial Dao, so Yang Kai cared for it deeply.

He had already collected six pieces; counting the one from Purple Star, that made seven, and the remaining two were now within reach — once he gathered them all, the passage could be opened.

He was determined to obtain the Purple Star's piece.

Reaching the three boxes, Yang Kai examined them for a time and, after confirming there were no suppressive formations around, picked up the first box.

When he opened it, there sat what looked like a piece of crystal stone.

Yang Kai's expression immediately grew strange. He inspected it closely and realized he could not recognize what it was. The crystal was round, its texture pure and flawless, appearing much like a Saint Crystal.

But it was definitely not a Saint Crystal.

A true Saint Crystal would never be stored within Purple Star's Treasure Vault.

Yang Kai took the round crystal from the box; his face turned even stranger. He found the thing gave off no energy fluctuation at all, like a useless piece of glass.

Yet when he released his Divine Sense to probe it, his face changed abruptly and he gasped, "So strong?"

In that instant, he had felt from the unassuming crystal an energy surge beyond imagination.

The magnitude of that energy was like a boundless ocean; when his Divine Sense flowed into it, he had an uncanny sensation of probing into an endless depth that made his heart skip.

"Could this really be a Saint Crystal?" Yang Kai could not be certain. He could feel the energy contained within was utterly pure and could be absorbed and refined by cultivators to aid their practice, much like a Saint Crystal, yet who had ever seen a Saint Crystal with such overwhelming energy?

He attempted to circulate his cultivation method and draw out the crystal's internal energy. Smoothly, the stored energy flowed along his palm and surged into his limbs and bones.

Yang Kai instantly felt clear-minded and invigorated, as though his whole body were wrapped in a vast surge of energy.

After only a moment's absorption, he realized he had taken in roughly the equivalent of the reserves of a hundred Saint Crystals. And the round crystal itself remained unchanged, as if its internal energy were inexhaustible.

"This can't be anything but an Earth Vein Crystal," Yang Kai suddenly recalled a rumor he had heard before and his eyes lit up.

An Earth Vein was a special accumulation of Spiritual Qi gathered beneath the earth; it could neither be moved nor transferred. Wherever an Earth Vein existed, the surrounding Spiritual Qi tended to be denser. Great powers, families, and sects liked to establish their main halls above Earth Veins so disciples would have superior environments for cultivation.

The stronger a Sect was, the more it sought to claim the finest Earth Veins.

Earth Veins were ranked; the lowest-grade veins were common in spiritual mountains and great rivers, slightly better veins were rarer, and the finest veins were as scarce as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

Lingxiao Sect's current seat was located above a fine Earth Vein deep underground, which explained the abundance of Spiritual Qi.

Earth Veins varied not only in rank but also in size. Some spanned vast lands; others extended only three or five li. Anything was possible.

Legend spoke of a supreme Earth Vein in which all heaven-and-earth energy had long condensed in one place, eventually forming the shape of a crystal stone — this was the Earth Vein Crystal.

While an Earth Vein itself could not be moved, an Earth Vein Crystal could be carried.

Possessing an Earth Vein Crystal was equivalent to carrying the finest Earth Vein at all times; a cultivator could use it to practice and no longer rely on Saint Crystals, while cultivation speed would increase by hundreds or thousands of times.

Yang Kai had never encountered an Earth Vein Crystal before; he had only heard of them in rumors.

Yet here in Purple Star's Treasure Vault, there stood an object that might very well be an Earth Vein Crystal.

It was a heaven-defying treasure. Although it served only a single person rather than an entire family or sect, possessing such a Crystal would make any cultivator's advancement inevitable.

Clutching the Earth Vein Crystal, Yang Kai's grin split his face almost to his ears.

At his current realm, few things could move his heart, but the Earth Vein Crystal was undoubtedly one of them.

He slipped the Earth Vein Crystal into his Spatial Ring without much thought and then picked up the second box.

When he opened it he found a special token inside; imperial might flowed slowly from it, and the front bore a prominent character meaning "Emperor". If this was not a Star Emperor Token, then what else could it be?

Yang Kai took it without ceremony.

With that, the seventh Star Emperor Token was finally in his possession.

He set his gaze on the last box.

One of the previous boxes had contained an Earth Vein Crystal, the other a Star Emperor Token — both were incredibly valuable, so Yang Kai naturally held high expectations for the third box.

He opened it and had not even had time to see what lay within before his expression shifted and he frantically activated his method to suppress the surging blood in his body.

At the same time, an almost imperceptible dragon's roar reverberated from his body.

The Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade burst uncontrollably outward and transformed into a jade-green giant dragon that hovered before him. The dragon's enormous head had eyes like copper bells, staring fixedly at the item in the third jade box with a complex expression.

Yang Kai's face grew grave. He formed a hand seal and, with a thought, drew the dragon back into his body, but his blood still flowed wildly and a voice from deep within kept ringing as if something in the third box was calling to him.

Carefully peering into the box, Yang Kai discovered it contained a palm-sized scale.

It looked like a fish scale, yet ornate carvings and patterns covered it. An ancient, feral aura flowed from the scale that made one's heart tremble.

"Dragon scale!" Yang Kai exclaimed in shock. "It is a dragon scale!"

He could not have imagined that the third box would hold a dragon scale, a true dragon scale.

He carried the Golden Sacred Dragon's origin and had cultivated the Yao Transformation Technique of the yao. He had also refined the Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl into the Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade. Few in the world knew dragons better than Yang Kai.

So the moment he saw the scale, Yang Kai recognized it as genuine.

It had fallen from the body of a true dragon of the Ancient Divine Spirit, a scale from a legendary true dragon.

The dense dragon might on the scale was almost tangible and resonated strongly with the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin within Yang Kai, making his blood surge ceaselessly and depriving him of calm.

The Ancient Divine Spirit existed only in legend; true dragons, phoenixes, qilin, and pixiu belonged to that category. Whether they truly existed or not, no one knew, and no one had seen them.

If Yang Kai had not obtained the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin and the Dragon Bone Sword, and had not had Yang Yan personally vouch for it, he would likely have remained skeptical.

He had acquired his Golden Sacred Dragon Origin in Dragon Valley on Tongxuan Continent, and the Dragon Bone Sword from Flowing Flame Sandland — both with long histories. And now, in Purple Star's Treasure Vault, he had once more come upon a dragon scale.

Yang Kai's eyes flashed with keen light; his heart swelled with excitement.

For most, a dragon scale or even the Dragon Bone Sword would merely be excellent materials for forging or a fine secret treasure, but to Yang Kai they held even greater significance.

Not for no reason. The Yao Transformation Technique that Lady Chi Yue had given him—its first half relied on the Golden Sacred Dragon’s origin to simulate the form of a true dragon, allowing him to grow stronger. But it was only a simulation, nothing more.

The second half explained how to fuse various body parts of ancient yao, truly acquiring their divine abilities.

For example, if Yang Kai could fuse this dragon scale into his body, he could gain true-dragon levels of defense.

He could even fuse the Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade into himself, replacing his spine with a genuine dragon's backbone.

Such an enhancement was beyond imagination. Once successful, Yang Kai's power would surge dramatically.

Previously his strength had been insufficient and he dared not attempt such fusions; the Dragon Bone Sword had been kept as a secret treasure. Now he had reached the Second Stage of the Void King Realm and was close to qualifying for fusion.

If he could fuse both the Dragon Bone Sword and the dragon scales, he could display some of a True Dragon's divine abilities.

It was almost inconceivable.

He had thought it unlikely he would ever see True Dragon materials in his lifetime, yet here was a dragon scale.

Taking a few deep breaths to steady himself, Yang Kai reached for the scale. But before his hand could touch it, the scale unleashed a frightful force that hurled toward him.

That force suddenly formed an invisible barrier that froze Yang Kai's hand in place; his hand bones cracked as if they might shatter at any moment, unable to move an inch further.

Yang Kai looked surprised and snorted coldly, "Dragon Transformation!"

At his words, golden light burst forth and surging dragon qi erupted from his body. The hand he had extended suddenly thickened, and his arm became covered with dragon scales formed from condensed Saint Yuan, lifelike as if real; his palm turned sharp like a dragon's claw.

Dragon might spread and strange sounds echoed.

This was indeed a true dragon scale, but it had fallen off countless years ago. And the Dragon Origin Yang Kai carried was that of a Golden Sacred Dragon—far beyond what an ordinary true dragon could compare to. How could a mere ancient scale possibly resist it?

The force that had restrained his movement crumbled step by step beneath the aura of the Golden Sacred Dragon Origin.

The air above him resounded with numerous cracking sounds.

Yang Kai easily seized the dragon scale, examined it carefully for a moment with a grin, then placed it back in the box and slipped it into his Spatial Ring.

The dragon might dissipated and his Dragon-Transformation technique withdrew. Purple Star's Treasure Vault returned to normal, but the small vault now looked utterly empty and desolate.

Outside, Ji Jun paced anxiously and frequently glanced at the door to the inner hall, but Yang Kai did not appear.

That bastard was absolutely ransacking the Treasure Vault! Ji Jun knew it all too clearly, but he could do nothing—his heart ached as though it were bleeding.
