## Chapter 1826 — Just You Two?

On the Tongxuan Continent, a place of outstanding people and fertile land. Here nine main peaks formed a ring; it had once been the famed Nine Heavens Sacred Land, supreme in martial power, its number of experts unrivaled across the entire continent.

But some years ago, the people of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land suddenly vanished cleanly; no one knew where they had gone.

Rumors said their lord had led them into a vast Star Domain; others claimed they had provoked an immensely powerful being and were wiped out. Various stories abounded, but the truth remained unknown.

In any case, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had become a land without a master.

Many sects and clans turned their eyes to this treasure land. After the disciples of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land disappeared, countless clashes erupted in the struggle to seize it, casualties beyond counting.

In the end, the treasure fell into the hands of two martial artists named Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai.

Both of them were free-spirited wanderers, men of no renown who never concerned themselves with worldly affairs. Their lives revolved around poetry, wine, and beauty, taking the roaming of the continent and the savoring of its myriad sights as their life’s pursuit.

One day they happened to pass by the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; seeing the place rich with Spiritual Qi and the mountains and waters clear and fair, they unceremoniously laid claim to it.

Both were experts of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—what cat-and-dog sect or clan dared resist? Though unwilling, they could only withdraw.

That stay stretched into several years; the two grew accustomed to the place and remained, never leaving.

At this moment, atop one of the main peaks among the Nine Peaks, the two sat opposite one another in a pavilion, boiling tea and discussing the Dao, carefree.

Inside the pavilion a dozen or so lithe young maidens served nearby, their beautiful eyes shining with a strange light as they watched the two. These girls had all been rescued by the two during their travels—some had lost their families and were homeless, others had been abused by ruffians and powerless to resist.

The two were free in temperament. They did not contend with others or the world, carried themselves with uncommon bearing, handsome and debonair. Though possessing peak power at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, they were affable, and naturally won the love and admiration of these women.

A chessboard lay on the stone table before them, black and white pieces interlaced. Their chess matched their temperaments; there was not a trace of murderous intent on the board. Many formations of surrounding but not killing left onlookers in awe.

"Brother Yi, I heard the other day the Jinqian Sect was also exterminated by that group of unknown people—three thousand people in the sect. Some died, some fled, the rest seem to have been enslaved. Those outsiders are truly hateful," Lin Yuhao said as he elegantly set down a piece, worry faint across his brow.

Yi Zhengkai did not drop his piece; he looked up at Lin Yuhao and said lightly, "Brother Lin, are you thinking of coming out of seclusion?"

Lin Yuhao chuckled, opened his folding fan and fanned casually. "When we swore brotherhood, we vowed this life to seek only freedom and to create no killing. If we betray that, let Heaven strike us with thunder. The world's winds shift, disasters come, families are destroyed—what does that have to do with me?"

"Is that really what Brother Lin thinks?" Yi Zhengkai looked at him with a half-smile and said sharply, "Isn't it that Brother Lin has been unsettled these days? Even your way of playing chess has changed.”

Lin Yuhao looked down and nervously fumbled with the chessboard, laughing awkwardly, "Haha, indeed—my last move seems to have been wrong."

"Brother Lin did not err, only... Brother Lin harbors killing intent!" Yi Zhengkai said, his face suddenly solemn as he dropped a piece; in an instant the entire board's atmosphere shifted from placid to murderous, that cold killing intent seeming to pierce through the board and soar into the nine skies.

Lin Yuhao's face changed slightly; he said calmly, "Brother Yi, are you not the same?"

Yi Zhengkai laughed heartily: "We truly are brothers—our thoughts coincide."

Lin Yuhao sighed a little: "These years we have only cared for our own ease and never concerned ourselves with others' life and death on this continent; even these girls..."

He glanced at the girls attending around them, a trace of guilt on his face. "I couldn't bear to watch any longer, so I brought them back. After living so freely for half a lifetime, sometimes I wonder if such a life is really right."

"When the Bone Race revived, we ignored it—yet it was the experts of the human, yao and demon races, led by the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, who crushed the foreign threat and defended this land. Without that lord and those experts, how could we have continued our carefree days? We'd likely have been devoured by the Bone Race; where would today's tea and discourse come from?"

"Indeed," Yi Zhengkai nodded. "What Brother Lin thinks is exactly what I have in my heart. Back then… we should have stood and fallen with those human-yao-demon experts; even if we died and our Dao vanished, at least we would have a clear conscience."

"Whenever I recall those days, my heart is uneasy. This land's brightness was bought with their lives, yet we have wantonly enjoyed and squandered it—how can we claim the right?" Lin Yuhao said, ashamedly laughing.

Yi Zhengkai narrowed his eyes: "Now the opportunity has come. Brother Lin, will you join me and, following the example of the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, make amends for those past regrets?"

"Of course!" Lin Yuhao leapt to his feet, heroic spirit soaring. "This continent gave me life and nurtured me—how can I watch those outsiders run rampant? Among the living, you and I are the strongest; if we don't come forth, who will raise this resounding banner?"

"Well said!" Yi Zhengkai slammed the table and rose. "Since Brother Lin has decided, I will stake my life and lend my utmost strength!"

"Just you two?" a derisive voice suddenly sounded.

The two, full of righteous spirit and blood boiling, felt as if a bucket of cold water had been thrown on them; both changed expression, turned to look around and shouted, "Who lurks there?"

At that moment a youth suddenly appeared not far off in an uncanny fashion, a trace of disdain on his face, walking through the air step by step toward them.

He had appeared without the slightest sign, as if stepping out from the void.

Yi Zhengkai and Lin Yuhao stared straight at him and sent out Divine Sense to probe; the next moment both brothers' faces turned pale, for their Divine Sense passed right through him like a stone sinking into the sea, with no response.

And the youth showed absolutely no energy fluctuations; he looked no different from an ordinary person.

But the two knew this youth was by no means ordinary; this was precisely the sign that his cultivation far surpassed their own.

"Are you one of those outsiders who have been wreaking havoc on the continent?" Yi Zhengkai asked sharply, seeming to have made the connection. At the same time he shot Lin Yuhao a look and the two quietly circulated Saint Yuan, prepared to strike with their lives at the slightest provocation.

Yang Kai didn’t even bother to pay attention to their intentions. He walked straight past them, sat down by the stone table, and beckoned to a dazed young girl nearby with a light smile. “Miss, pour me a cup of tea, will you? Just had a fight—dying of thirst here.”

The girl stood motionless, still in a state of shock.

To these girls, Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai had seemed nearly omnipotent, the most formidable men in the world; but when Yang Kai appeared, those two the girls worshipped looked as if they had met a plague god, sweat beading on their brows.

The girls were quick of wit and already understood Yang Kai's might.

Hearing Yi Zhengkai's earlier words, one of them even ground her teeth and said, "Villain, I won't give you the young masters' tea."

Yang Kai looked astonished and pointed at his nose, "Me? What makes you think I'm a villain?"

"You outsiders kill and enslave others—if that isn't being wicked, what is?" The girl, innocent and unrestrained, spoke without fear, giving Yang Kai no face.

Not only she—the dozen girls nearby all glared at Yang Kai with murderous eyes.

Yang Kai felt uncomfortable under those dozen killing glares; he awkwardly scratched his nose and said, "When did I ever say I was an outsider? Based on your young master's guess? You trust him that much?"

"Whatever the young master says is without doubt!" the girl puffed out her chest, her developing bosom swollen and rather fetching.

Yang Kai glanced at Yi Zhengkai and snickered.

Yi Zhengkai's face soured; fearing to provoke Yang Kai, he hastily rebuked, "Ling'er, do not be rude—go pour a cup of tea for this friend!"

Only then did the girl named Ling'er grudgingly walk over, lift the teapot and fill a cup, then stomp back with folded arms.

"Thanks." Yang Kai picked up the cup and drained it in one gulp, smacking his lips: "So-so."

"So-so?" Lin Yuhao's veins stood out; he said in a low voice, "Do you know what tea that is?"

"No." Yang Kai shook his head.

Lin Yuhao snorted. "This is Yangya White Snow, worth a fortune in the world; in a hundred years only three or so are produced, brewed with supreme true water—and you call it so-so..."

"Alright, alright." Yang Kai waved his hand to cut him off. "Tea is for drinking—why say so much? One swallow and it's gone."

"You..." Lin Yuhao was furious.

Yi Zhengkai said, "Brother Lin, there's no need to stoop to his level. This person plainly is no man of refinement."

Lin Yuhao snorted coldly.

"What use is refinement?" Yang Kai sneered. "Can it be eaten? Can it kill? The outside world is in chaos—you're so refined, why not make refinement a weapon, kill those scoundrels, and restore a clear sky to this continent?"

At those words, Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai both looked awkward. Lin Yuhao forced a proud tone, "No need for you to say—we and Brother Yi are preparing to come down and teach those outsiders a lesson."

"Don't be naive." Yang Kai laughed loudly. "With just the two of you, if you really went, someone would clap you dead with a single palm."

"You dare insult us!" Lin Yuhao flew into a rage, forming a strange hand sign and shouting, "Whoever you are, dare insult me and Brother Yi—prepare to be punished! Flower Plucking Finger!"
