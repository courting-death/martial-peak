## Chapter 1299 — A Successful Haul

Just as Yang Yan's expression flickered uncertainly and she seemed at a loss, the source of the Violent Aura drew ever closer, now less than a thousand zhang away, and Yang Kai could even hear the sound of hurried footsteps reaching his ears.

Yang Kai gave a slight sigh, knowing it would be too late if they didn't leave now. Although the Sun's True Essence suppressed the area and ordinary Corpse Soldiers dared not come near, who could say what means a Corpse General who had cultivated for two thousand years might possess? Staying would bring nothing but harm.

Before Yang Kai could speak, Yang Yan's beautiful eyes suddenly brightened as if she'd remembered something, and she hurriedly waved to the side, calling out, "Xiaoxiao!"

The Stone Puppet that was devouring a mine piled with rare ore shot over without hesitation. By this time the more than a dozen small mounds piled here had already been mostly consumed by the Stone Puppet, with only about half left in place.

When the Stone Puppet arrived, Yang Yan pointed at the Sun's True Essence before them and softly asked, "Can you swallow it?"

On the Stone Puppet's seemingly wooden face there showed a trace of hesitation and fear; even its eyes revealed a grave seriousness.

The Stone Puppet was born with an innate divine ability to devour all manner of ores and draw out their essences—this talent was natural and immensely powerful; it could swallow something like an Ethereal Crystal without effort, but faced with a skull-sized Sun's True Essence, it hesitated.

Clearly, this thing was exceedingly dangerous even for it.

Seeing this, Yang Yan showed a helpless expression and did not want to force it. After all, to Yang Yan the Sun's True Essence was undeniably priceless, but the Stone Puppet was equally irreplaceable. This little creature had helped Yang Yan refine crafting materials numerous times; she had long since developed affection for it and did not treat it as a mere tool, but as a living being.

To Yang Yan's surprise, after hesitating for a moment the Stone Puppet suddenly let out a low roar. Immediately light erupted from its body; the armor-like skin that cloaked it shimmered as halos flowed, and one by one strange, inscrutable rune-like sigils danced across its surface.

In an instant the Stone Puppet's aura underwent a tremendous change, giving the impression of impregnable solidity, as if nothing in the world could destroy it.

Yang Kai and Yang Yan both stood dumbfounded. They had never imagined the Stone Puppet possessed such a talent.

Those rune-like phenomena lasted only a moment before vanishing, and the Stone Puppet's already extraordinary armor-like hide now flashed with refined brilliance, making it look all the more formidable.

A series of crisp cracking sounds came from the Stone Puppet's joints, and under Yang Kai and Yang Yan's astonished gaze the small Stone Puppet's body suddenly grew many times larger—fully reaching three zhang in height—before stopping.

It then strode forward, eyes solemn, approached the Sun's True Essence, stretched out a large hand, and seized for it.

A terrifying blaze flowed from inside the Sun's True Essence, forming a fire-serpent that rushed at the Stone Puppet's great hand. The Stone Puppet seemed to expose a feral grin. With one open-and-close of its hand it snatched the fire-serpent into its palm; with a fierce squeeze, radiance scattered and the fire-serpent was crushed with ease.

Even so, Yang Kai saw that the Stone Puppet's hand appeared somewhat melted, which made his eyelids twitch.

With the fire-serpent no longer obstructing it, the Stone Puppet seized the skull-sized Sun's True Essence, opened its massive maw and tossed it in. The next moment a dull roar burst from its throat as if it were enduring unimaginable torment; its skin flushed crimson, runes on its mighty armor reappeared and shattered one by one into surges of mysterious power that poured into its body, suppressing that terrifying heat.

After doing all this, the Stone Puppet's body shrank again and in an instant returned to its original form.

Yang Kai did not hesitate; he directly stored the Stone Puppet into his Black Book Space.

Earlier he had witnessed the terror of the Sun's True Essence and dared not casually place it into the Black Book Space. Now that the Stone Puppet had swallowed it, storing it was naturally safe.

None of what had occurred here escaped the notice of the two Corpse Soldiers standing at the cavern entrance and observing.

Seeing that these two who had rashly broken into the Corpse Den actually had a way to take the Sun's True Essence, the Corpse Soldiers could no longer remain calm. They uttered sharp howls from their mouths and leapt toward them.

The female Corpse Soldier suddenly sprouted ten long, jet-black nails from her fingers; with hair disheveled like a demon she reached to claw at Yang Kai.

The male Corpse Soldier opened his mouth and a dense wave of Corpse Qi rolled out, surging straight toward where Yang Kai and Yang Yan stood.

Yang Kai snorted coldly. A strand of golden silk shot from his hand to wrap the female Corpse Soldier, and with a single hand he slashed illusions—sending forth ink-black, blade-like attacks toward the male Corpse Soldier.

"Space Blade!" The male Corpse Soldier had already learned of some of Yang Kai's methods from his comrade; seeing it now he was greatly alarmed and hurriedly dodged, while the female Corpse Soldier's body was pierced through by the Golden Blood Threads and instantly bound in place.

Yang Kai flicked the Golden Blood Threads and golden light flooded the air; that single strand seemed to become a golden net, enveloping the female Corpse Soldier.

"Impossible!" the female Corpse Soldier cried, as if witnessing something inconceivable. When the golden light retracted, her corpse became scattered pieces on the ground, like a crystal cup knocked over and shattered into countless fragments.

Seeing his equally strong comrade slain in a single encounter, the male Corpse Soldier's jade-green eyes filled with deep fear; he no longer dared tangle with Yang Kai and hurriedly retreated, nearly exiting the secret cavern.

At that moment a tall, imposing figure abruptly appeared at the cavern's entrance. He wore a blood-red robe; though still somewhat thin, he looked almost no different from the living—his face was fleshed out and his eyes carried normal coloring, black and white distinct—but from him emanated an overwhelmingly fierce killing intent and a suffocatingly dense Corpse Qi.

The moment he appeared he fixed his gaze on Yang Kai, who was removing the jade platform made from Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade. With a casual wave at the subordinate who had rushed before him, the male Corpse Soldier who had barely escaped Yang Kai's Space Blade was shattered to powder by a single strike, exploding apart.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed at the sight and he barked in a low voice, "Corpse General!"

This was the powerful Corpse General he had sensed earlier; in mere moments he had arrived and instantly slain one of his subordinates—he was clearly raging with fury.

The Corpse General saw that everything placed on the ice-jade platform had vanished and that there was no longer the Sun's True Essence's aura he feared—how could he not know something had happened?

Immediately a low roar issued from his mouth.

Yang Kai's body wavered for no reason, a sensation of being torn arose, and his Sea of Consciousness suddenly churned as if boiling over.

Yang Yan fared even worse; light flickered across her and her face went pale—she spat a mouthful of blood, clearly having suffered a severe wound.

"Leave the things!" the Corpse General snarled coldly and strode forward to press at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had no hesitation. He slashed out more than ten Space Blades, then tore at the void with both hands, ripping open a spatial rift. While the Corpse General watched the Space Blades with a look of stunned doubt, Yang Kai seized Yang Yan and plunged into the rift.

Only then did the arriving Corpse General seem to realize something was wrong. He howled wildly as a mass of yellow, dense Corpse Qi poured from his body and formed a gigantic tentacle that lashed toward the spatial rift.

But it was too late. When his Corpse Qi tentacle struck the rift, Yang Kai and Yang Yan's figures had already vanished. Although his attack rocked the rift's stability, it could not prevent their escape.

"Spatial power!" The Corpse General froze, then immediately flew into a furious rage, thunderous howls erupting from his mouth in evident unwillingness.

If the other had not cultivated this strange spatial power, how could he have let the two escape? Given three breaths' time, he could have smashed those two into pulp and kept everything.

After a moment, figures emerged throughout the secret cavern, all with sullen faces scanning around. Each emanated an aura not inferior to that of the first Corpse General to arrive; they were all peak Origin Returning Realm beings—and there were as many as four of them.

Other Corpse Generals, each possessing strength equivalent to the First or Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, were also rushing toward the scene — the entire Corpse Den was in an uproar.

"Where is the Sun's True Essence?" one Corpse General in cyan robes glanced at the spot where the jade platform had been and his expression changed.

"It was taken." The red-robed Corpse General who had arrived first replied irritably.

"What? The Sun's True Essence was taken?" the other two Corpse Generals cried out in disbelief. "Could the ones who came be Origin Returning Realm experts? But I clearly sensed that one of them was only Second Stage of the Saint King Realm."

"It's true one was Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, but how they took the Sun's True Essence I do not know either," the red-robed Corpse General answered.

"You couldn't even stop a mere Second Stage of the Saint King Realm? Junior Brother Long, have you slept too long?" the cyan-robed Corpse General sneered coldly at him.

The red-robed Corpse General cast him a faint glance and said coolly, “The opponent cultivates space power — and seems highly adept at it. He tore open space itself and escaped. Senior Brother Mo, do you truly think you could have stopped him?”

"Spatial power?"

"Tearing space?"

"Impossible!"

The other three Corpse Generals all cried out in astonishment, disbelief flooding their eyes.

"There are still residual fluctuations of spatial power here; whether or not, you can each sense it yourselves," the red-robed Corpse General said, unwilling to explain further, then fell silent.

The other Corpse Generals released their divine senses to probe; after a moment their faces turned ugly—they indeed perceived residual fluctuations of spatial power remaining, and it seemed the red-robed Corpse General had not lied.
