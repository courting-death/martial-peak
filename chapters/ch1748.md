## Chapter 1748 — Luo Lan Comes to Visit

Afterwards, Yang Kai asked Yue Xi and her two disciples about the cultivation methods they practiced and the Secret Treasures they used.

The three of them told him everything in detail, without the slightest concealment.

As for cultivation techniques, Yang Kai could not offer much advice and could only let them explore and refine on their own. As for Secret Treasures, he was not stingy.

Yue Xi originally possessed two Origin-Grade Secret Treasures, but both were Lower-Level Origin-Grade; although they could raise her combat power somewhat, their effect was very limited.

Yang Kai handed his Feather Spirit Arrow and the Formation Talisman that contained the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation over to Yue Xi.

With his rise in strength, these two Secret Treasures had become somewhat superfluous to him—things that were a pity to discard yet useless to keep.

The Feather Spirit Arrow went without saying: pour Saint Yuan into it and once triggered it delivered tremendous explosive power; sadly, the Saint Yuan stored within could at most be released twice, and after two uses the Feather Spirit Arrow needed to be recharged.

With Yang Kai’s current methods, he did not need to rely on Secret Treasures at all against cultivators of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and against Void King Realm opponents the Feather Spirit Arrow’s power was also not ideal.

It was just right to give them to Yue Xi to boost her strength.

The Formation Talisman sealing the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation was the same—its usefulness to Yang Kai was limited.

But if these two peculiarly effective Secret Treasures were placed with Yue Xi, they would greatly increase her strength; with them at her side, Yue Xi’s First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivation could pose a mortal threat to warriors of the Third Stage.

Upon receiving the two Secret Treasures, Yue Xi could not contain her joy.

Although she had Qin Wuhui’s care within the Sword Alliance and followed close to Gu Jianxin, where could she ever obtain such fine things? Yang Kai’s generosity and wealth both shocked and delighted her.

Yang Kai did not give Secret Treasures to He Zao and He Miao because the sisters had just received gifts from Qin Wuhui; those two Origin-Grade Middle-Level curved blade Secret Treasures, after the sisters had spent some time exploring and tempering them, had gradually revealed their use.

The two curved blades combined into one and could form a single circular blade, and the Secret Treasures’ grade could rival Upper-Level Origin-Grade, with terrifying lethality.

Secret Treasures were not about quantity but utility—only those that could be used were worth having.

Yang Kai gave two Origin Condensing Pills to He Zao and He Miao; with their current situation they only needed to accumulate a bit more before attempting to break through to the Origin Returning Realm.

In addition, Yang Kai supplied the three of them with a large amount of Saint Crystal and Spiritual Pills for cultivating, then sent them off to seclude themselves.

After that, Yang Kai began arranging a Great Space Array here, preparing to connect it to the transit stations he had left behind.

He deliberately chose the innermost palace as the site to lay out the Space Array.

Familiar with the work, he refined various materials, carved the formation, and infused it with spatial power.

After a few days’ effort, a Great Space Array took shape.

The Ethereal Crystals in his hand were completely consumed in the array’s construction; the number of Ethereal Crystals had almost not been enough to meet the array’s needs, but fortunately Yang Kai’s luck and calculations held, and he was able to finish the layout.

He extended his Divine Sense to probe Yue Xi and her two disciples and found they were still secluded in cultivation, so he inlaid Saint Crystals into the array and activated it.

After a single transit transfer, Yang Kai quickly arrived at that mining star.

The subterranean ruins that Yang Kai had discovered earlier were brightly lit; countless warrior figures bustled about within.

Yang Kai found, to his surprise, that there were not only disciples of Lingxiao Sect and Yingyue Hall but also people from Qiantian Sect and Liuli Sect, as well as many warriors from sects on friendly terms with Lingxiao Sect.

It seemed Ye Xijun and the others had established a foothold here, which was why warriors from other sects had come to mine.

“Sect Master Yang?” As Yang Kai watched, a startled call came from not far away.

Yang Kai turned and discovered the caller was Mo Yu of Qiantian Sect!

“Elder Mo Yu.” Yang Kai greeted him with a cheerful smile.

“So it truly is Sect Master Yang.” Mo Yu was overjoyed and hurried forward. “I thought I had mistaken you; I didn’t expect it really to be you. Where did Sect Master Yang come from?”

“Qingmu Star!” Yang Kai answered casually.

“Sect Master Yang is truly talented!” Mo Yu looked at him with admiration. “If not for you, we on Dark Star would have remained trapped; I never imagined we could now transport freely between stars. Such a feat—aside from our Dark Star warriors—no one in the Star Domain could accomplish it, right?”

“Heh.” Yang Kai laughed and did not deny it.

It was indeed true: without a Space Array founded on his Spatial Force, ultra-long-distance teleportation could not be supported. There might be a few Great Arrays left from ancient times in the Star Domain, but they were far less stable and safe than ones Yang Kai himself arranged.

No one dared use those arrays unless absolutely necessary.

“Sect Master Yang, did you come to see Great Elder Ye?” Mo Yu asked.

“Yes. Where is the Great Elder?”

“Come, I’ll take you.” Mo Yu hurried ahead to lead the way.

Because Lingxiao Sect had risen, countless sects and clans on Dark Star benefited; not to mention the last time the Corpse Spirit Sect ravaged the world and Lingxiao Sect with Yingyue Hall had turned the tide, this time Qiantian Sect’s good relations with Lingxiao Sect also earned them the opportunity to come to the ore star and mine rare minerals.

Mo Yu and Yang Kai had long been on friendly terms, so Mo Yu was especially enthusiastic now.

Soon Yang Kai met Ye Xijun and Qian Tong, who were stationed in the ruins.

When they learned he went to a cultivation star called Qingmu Star and already had his own territory, everyone was ecstatic.

This meant warriors who had reached the limit on Dark Star could finally escape the constraint of local law and attempt to sense the mysteries of the Void King Realm.

Especially for Ye Xijun, she had waited for this day for a very long time.

“When does the Great Elder plan to depart?” Yang Kai asked Ye Xijun.

To Yang Kai’s surprise, Ye Xijun shook her head. “I will not go for the moment.”

Yang Kai fell silent for a moment, then quickly realized, “Because of Yang Yan?”

“Yes.” Ye Xijun parted her lips lightly. “If I were to breakthrough to the Void King Realm on Qingmu Star, it would be difficult for me to remain on Dark Star afterward. Hall Master Qian’s condition is the best example. I think… I will wait until she wakes before I deal with my own matters.”

“I see.” Yang Kai, hearing this, could not persuade her otherwise.

Ye Xijun had sacrificed much for Yang Yan; she once had an opportunity to leave Dark Star with Yang Kai, but because Yang Yan remained in slumber she chose to stay and watch over her—this was the same reason now.

“That’s fine.” Yang Kai smiled again. “Given the Great Elder’s condition, when the time is right a rise to the Void King Realm shouldn’t be too difficult.”

“You overestimate me.” Ye Xijun gave a self-deprecating smile. “Throughout history the Void King Realm has always been the highest state for warriors; countless Origin Returning Realm practitioners are stuck at this gate and never comprehend its secrets in a lifetime. I do not have absolute confidence.”

Yang Kai chuckled, knowing Ye Xijun was being modest.

If the earlier Ye Xijun lacked full confidence, the present one—continually absorbing Domain Stone energy and comprehending the marvels of the Domain Field—had at least an eighty percent chance of successfully breaking through to the Void King Realm.

“Anyway, I came back to tell you this news.” Yang Kai looked around. “As for when you go to Qingmu Star, decide for yourselves.”

“Don’t worry; when the time comes the Great Elder, Brother Mo, and I will organize a group to head to Qingmu Star.” Qian Tong chuckled nearby. “Such a chance can’t be missed. Even if one cannot remain long on Dark Star after reaching the Void King Realm, it doesn’t matter much; with Space Arrays we can always return. Dark Star won’t face danger.”

“Alright, someone will receive you over there when you arrive.” Yang Kai nodded. “By the way, after mining here for so long, have you found any Ethereal Crystal veins?”

“No.” Qian Tong shook his head. “The Great Elder, Brother Mo, and I patrol from time to time searching for those veins. Although this ore star is extremely rich, we really haven’t found any Ethereal Crystal veins.”

Yang Kai did not hold high expectations; the Ethereal Crystal matter was only a casual question and with the negative answer he felt no disappointment.

He did not linger on the ore star; after issuing some instructions he returned via Space Array to his residence on Qingmu Star.

The round trip took him only half a day, so when he returned Yue Xi and her two disciples were still secluded in cultivation.

The days that followed passed without incident.

Zhu Liang came with several elders from Twin Shark Island to pay a visit, mainly to make themselves known; there was nothing major. After all, Twin Shark Island was nominally Yang Kai’s territory now; they would rely on him in the future and dared not be negligent.

A few First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioners did not trouble Yang Kai much; he received them politely and sent them on their way.

He waited for news from the Sword Alliance, believing such a powerful force would gather some Ethereal Crystals for him; with Ethereal Crystals he could once more set Great Space Arrays across the Star Domain, and then Dark Star warriors could go wherever they wished. Distance would no longer be an obstacle to their roaming.

Especially in connecting to Tongxuan Continent!

Yang Kai yearned to link Dark Star with his homeland.

Unfortunately, no news came from the Sword Alliance.

Two months later, while cultivating, Yang Kai received a report from Yue Xi: “People from the Sword Alliance have arrived.”

Yang Kai was greatly excited, rose at once to welcome them, and privately wondered how many Ethereal Crystals he might obtain this time.

He had thought Luo Lan would send someone casually to hand things over, but to his utter surprise the visitor was Luo Lan herself!
