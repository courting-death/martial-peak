## Chapter 1101 — Refining Instrument Pavilion

Yang Kai tidied that cave up a little, found a decent spot, and made it his bedroom.

Immediately after, he left the cave and made a circuit around Dragon Lair Mountain, which stretched for a thousand li in every direction. In his mind, he went over various great formations used to gather the world’s Spiritual Qi.

He had encountered many formations of this sort before—back in the Tianxiao Sect on Tongxuan Continent, within the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, at the Ghost Ancestor's residence on the Floating Continent, and a few years ago on Rainfall Star within Zong Ao's domain—so he was no stranger to such arrays.

Since he decided to stay here, of course he needed to give himself a comfortable environment for cultivation.

Yang Kai hadn't researched formations extensively; the ones he knew best were spirit formations used in pill refinement, but formations are manifold yet lead to the same ends, and years of exposure taught him how to set up a spirit formation to gather qi.

This required favorable terrain coupled with some materials; by using various methods he could lay out a respectable formation.

Although Dragon Lair Mountain wasn't large, Yang Kai found the natural conditions excellent—near the cave Wu Yi had found for him there were several peaks surrounding the cave, and using them as anchors would be ideal for arranging the formation.

As he wandered the hills, he kept recalling things Elder Xu Hui once told him when he had been the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, including one secret of the Sacred Land's Nine Peaks formations.

Soon he had a plan.

He didn't return to the cave but went straight to Tianyun City, fifty li away.

Tianyun City was effectively under Yingyue Hall's influence; even though the Haike Family was nearby, they did not control Tianyun City—the city was affluent, not something an outer minor clan could seize.

The Haike Family merely ran a few businesses in the city, earning cultivation provisions from passing warriors.

Entering Tianyun City, Yang Kai found it teeming with people and shops—its prosperity rivaled, if not surpassed, the cities on Rainfall Star or Shuiyue Star.

Most shop owners were disciples of Yingyue Hall or affiliated forces; they prospered in all directions and were making a fortune—each shop a money tree.

There were no crystal stone toll guards at the city gate. Yingyue Hall allowed anyone to freely enter and leave the city.

Yang Kai strolled along in high spirits, unhurriedly browsing the shops.

He was soon surprised to find that across this city—and perhaps the entire Dark Star—Saint Crystals were worth far more than on other cultivation stars.

For example, a bottle of Warm Source Pills that cost three hundred Lower-Level Saint Crystals elsewhere only required two hundred here.

Items valued at five hundred Lower-Level Saint Crystals elsewhere cost only around four hundred here.

The Dark Star's isolation had given it its own pricing system: Saint Crystals were scarce, so their value was greater and a small number could buy a great deal.

Yang Kai was excited.

His Black Book Space contained over forty-seven thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals. Conversion between qualities was one to five: one Upper-Level could become five Middle-Level, and one Middle-Level could become five Lower-Level Saint Crystals.

By that math he had over a million Lower-Level Saint Crystals—he could buy whatever he wanted.

He only purchased some ores and materials he needed.

Then he eagerly went to a place called the Refining Instrument Pavilion.

Every city had places that specialized in refining instruments—whether on Tongxuan Continent or in the Star Domain—wherever cultivators gathered, such places existed.

Not every cultivator could refine instruments; when they needed help they'd hire skilled refiners, giving those refiners practice and generous pay.

Tianyun City's Refining Instrument Pavilion was also an affiliate of Yingyue Hall. The dozens of resident refiners were mostly Yingyue Hall disciples, with some hired hands whose pay was shared with Yingyue Hall; although the hall took a large cut, these hires were relatively free to come and go.

When Yang Kai arrived he was stunned by the bustling scene inside.

Nearly two hundred cultivators of varying strength were in line, waiting for the pavilion's refiners to craft secret treasures for them.

The moment Yang Kai appeared, glances of varying temperatures fell on him; some were even wary, as if afraid he might cut in line.

The scene reminded him of when the Nine Heavens Sacred Land refined pills and crowds gathered outside the Nine Peaks—back then many would wait a month or more hoping to have pillmasters inside the Sacred Land refine their pills.

Now, standing here, Yang Kai understood the helpless impatience those people once felt.

He frowned—would he have to wait a long time as well?

A burly-looking attendant approached; the man was not young but not very powerful either—he seemed to have given up his own cultivation and worked here doing errands to earn a living.

He cheerfully handed Yang Kai a sheet of paper and said, "Take a look, choose at will—ask me if you don't understand anything."

Yang Kai took it skeptically. Looking it over, he found it listed the names of the pavilion's dozens of refiners, their abilities, fees, and a number at the end.

Yang Kai learned those numbers indicated how many cultivators were waiting for that refiner to take on a job.

He scanned and saw the top refiner already had thirty-some people waiting—and that person's greatest ability was to forge Saint King-Grade Upper-Level secret treasures!

No wonder so many sought him. Refiners and pillmasters had ranking systems; the higher the rank, the better the secret treasures or pills they could produce.

It was difficult for cultivators to gather materials; assembling the components for a secret treasure was even harder than for a pill, so they were careful in choosing a refiner—better pay more than choose a poor craftsman.

The refiner who could forge Saint King-Grade Upper-Level secret treasures charged handsomely, but his rank drew the crowds.

Yang Kai's gaze swept the list and lingered on a refiner named Yang Yan. He frowned as he studied the entry, then beckoned the attendant.

"Have you chosen which refiner you want to handle your secret treasure?" the attendant asked with a smile as he hurried over.

"Is the information on this paper accurate?" Yang Kai asked.

The attendant remained grinning. "Don't worry, sir—the pavilion is Yingyue Hall's enterprise. Most refiners are Yingyue Hall disciples. Their techniques and abilities passed the hall's tests; prices are fair—no deceit."

Yang Kai fixed him with a steady look, pushed the paper forward, and pointed: "Look at this—this Yang Yan charges so much and claims he can forge Origin-Grade secret treasures; why has no one chosen him?"

The number after Yang Yan's name was plainly zero—no one queued for him—while other refiners were swamped.

The attendant's smile turned oddly strained. "Sir, the pavilion's guarantee only covers refiners born of Yingyue Hall. For hired-in refiners we don't vouch for the accuracy of their claims. We told Master Yang Yan that when he came, but he insisted he could produce Origin-Grade secret treasures. If you distrust him, don't choose him. If any loss occurs we won't compensate you. There are many other refiners to choose from."

From the attendant's words, Yang Kai immediately realized this was Yingyue Hall's way of suppressing outside refiners.

By refusing to guarantee hired refiners, the pavilion made cultivators wary and thus unlikely to pick them.

"The other refiners..." Yang Kai frowned and slowly shook his head; their schedules were jam-packed, and even the fastest would take over ten days.

"Are you in a hurry? If so you can leave the materials here; when it's done you can come pick it up," the attendant suggested.

Yang Kai did not answer; instead he asked, "Has anyone ever had Yang Yan forge anything?"

"Yes."

"How did it turn out?"

The attendant's face twitched; he looked awkward, as if certain matters couldn't be spoken of, and after a long pause said, "Sir, I advise you to find another master to refine your secret treasure. Their fees are fairer and they won't demand outrageous sums like this one."

Even the attendant seemed to think little of Yang Yan, which puzzled Yang Kai—what was wrong with Yang Yan's skill?

As they spoke, a huge, hulking man stormed out of a room cursing, radiating murderous intent; he carried a gleaming great hammer and stomped off, furious.

Someone dared curse a refiner? Yang Kai was stunned.

Refiners and pillmasters were esteemed and rare—no cultivator would offend them, for every cultivator needed secret treasures and pills; to offend them was to cut off one's future.

The waiting cultivators seemed used to such scenes—this was not the first time they'd seen it; no one tried to stop the man, many watched with interest.
