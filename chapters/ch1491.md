## Chapter 1491 — Feather Spirit Arrow

The short arrow Yang Kai had already given a rough inspection before, so naturally he was even more curious about what was inside that jade box.

He did not know what material the jade box was made from, yet it could actually block the probing of Divine Sense, clearly of no low grade. Yang Kai took it out from his Spatial Ring, flicked his finger, and popped the lid open.

A vigorous and pure energy suddenly rushed out to meet him. The eagerly expectant Yang Kai brightened at once, involuntarily drawing a deep breath as a refreshing clarity washed through his mind.

Looking inside, he found that the jade box actually held only two immaculate, pure-white crystals shaped like hexagons. Each was roughly the size of a fingernail, yet under Yang Kai’s Divine Sense probe, the energy stored within the two crystals made his expression change drastically.

“What is this?” Yang Kai muttered to himself, pinching up one crystal and bringing it before his eyes for a careful look.

The crystal looked a little like a Saint Crystal, but its grade and texture were by no means comparable. Even Origin Saint Crystals condensed by the Stone Puppet could not compare with the energy contained within the one before him.

The two were simply not on the same level at all.

The energy stored within this crystal seemed to have already transcended the category of Saint Crystal.

Yang Kai’s heart trembled, his expression shifting.

He had roamed the world for many years, blessed with abundant opportunities and having seen countless good things. He even possessed several Void King-Grade Secret Treasures; very few things could move him.

Yet these two fingernail-sized crystals before him were definitely one of those few.

He stared for quite a while yet still could not determine what exactly they were. He could only test out that the energy stored in these two crystals was vast and pure to an inconceivable degree. It could be absorbed directly without conversion to replenish a cultivator’s Saint Yuan. Yang Kai absorbed for only a brief moment and felt that all the Saint Yuan he had expended earlier had already been fully restored.

Yet the crystal in his hand showed not the slightest change, as though the energy within it was inexhaustible.

Of course, that was impossible. It only meant that, relative to the storage within, the energy he had absorbed was merely a drop in the ocean, so no change could be perceived.

Even Upper-Level Saint Crystals — or even Origin Saint Crystals — paled instantly in comparison before these two crystalline chunks.

A fine treasure indeed! Yang Kai’s lips curled as he broke into a cheerful smile.

Though he had never worried about his Saint Yuan running dry and never needed to make special efforts to replenish it whether in battle or otherwise, these two crystals were undoubtedly helpful to him as well.

At the very least, when breaking through in the future, there would be no need to deliberately seek out places rich in Spiritual Qi.

With just these two energy crystals, he could break through safely anywhere without worrying about a lack of Spiritual Qi.

Naturally, Yang Kai was reluctant to use such bottom-of-the-chest treasures lightly. Apart from replenishing Spiritual Qi during breakthroughs, they might well have other great uses.

After a careful inspection, Yang Kai solemnly placed the two crystals back into the jade box and stowed it away with care.

Only then did he begin carefully examining that short arrow.

That short arrow was clearly a Secret Treasure, only its shape was a little peculiar—no more than half a chi in length, with the two characters “Feather Spirit” carved along the shaft, evidently the name of this Secret Treasure.

At the two ends of the Feather Spirit Arrow, a piece of unknown jade was set in respectively, pure white and flawless.

Yet the Secret Treasure itself did not emit the slightest fluctuation of energy.

That was truly strange. Since it was a Secret Treasure, it must have a grade, and anything with a grade would naturally exude an energy fluctuation for others to discern.

But this Feather Spirit Arrow seemed to defy that common sense. It looked unremarkable, and even a sweep with Divine Sense detected nothing suspicious, as if it were just an ordinary object.

Anything placed together with two hexagonal crystals brimming with energy was naturally not ordinary; Yang Kai simply could not identify it for the moment.

After a thought, Yang Kai urged his Saint Yuan and poured it into the Feather Spirit Arrow.

This was the usual way to test a Secret Treasure’s might.

It went very smoothly. The Feather Spirit Arrow accepted the Saint Yuan, and as the infusion continued, the crystal-clear jade set at the fore of the arrow underwent a change—its color gradually darkened.

On close inspection, one could even see a thread of fiery red within that black, scorching hot beyond measure.

The color of the Demonic Flame!

Yang Kai’s heart stirred. While keeping an eye on the jade’s change, he continued pouring Saint Yuan into the Feather Spirit Arrow.

Time passed. Only after a full hour did Yang Kai, his face solemn, cut off the output of his Saint Yuan and stare at the Feather Spirit Arrow, lost in thought.

The arrow was no longer as unremarkable as before. It now radiated a world-shaking energy fluctuation, seemingly in no way inferior to an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure—perhaps even surpassing it.

The energy fluctuation of this bizarre Secret Treasure was actually strengthening in tandem with the infusion of his Saint Yuan!

Moreover, Origin-Grade Upper-Level was far from its limit.

It was just that, limited by Yang Kai’s current realm and cultivation, the Saint Yuan he could pour into it could only bring forth the energy fluctuation of an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure.

A full hour of Saint Yuan infusion—such a quantity was astonishing.

Any other Origin Returning Realm cultivator could not accomplish this within an hour; only Yang Kai, with an enormous reservoir of Saint Yuan within him, could pour it in madly without regard for the consequences.

Yang Kai made a quick calculation. This round of infusion was roughly equivalent to the total Saint Yuan within a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

In other words, if another Origin Returning Realm obtained this Feather Spirit Arrow—even at the Third Stage—he would have to drain all his strength to accomplish the same.

If he were at the First or Second Stage, he might have to infuse it several times—more than ten—to reach saturation.

Yang Kai secretly clicked his tongue in amazement.

Very soon, his gaze shifted to the piece of jade at the rear end of the Feather Spirit Arrow.

The shaft of this Secret Treasure had a total of two jades inlaid; both should be able to accept Saint Yuan.

Thinking so, Yang Kai continued to urge his Saint Yuan.

Another hour later, the jade at the rear of the Feather Spirit Arrow also reached saturation, confirming Yang Kai’s conjecture.

Drawing a light breath, a look of joy surfaced on Yang Kai’s face. Though he did not know what sort of exalted master had refined this Feather Spirit Arrow, it was undoubtedly an inconceivable Secret Treasure. Used well, it could deliver a decisive blow at critical moments.

Moreover, even without refinement it could smoothly accept his Saint Yuan. Evidently, the Feather Spirit Arrow either had never had a master, or too much time had passed and the life imprint left within by its former master had completely worn away, rendering it masterless once more.

Now he need only refine it slightly to claim it for his own.

Resolute in thought and deed, Yang Kai did not hesitate. Cradling the Feather Spirit Arrow in both hands, he began pouring his Divine Sense into it, seeking to imprint his life mark and Divine Sense aura within.

The sun hid and the moon rose as time flowed on.

Half a month later, Yang Kai rose to his feet. With a thought, the Feather Spirit Arrow turned into a streak of light and burrowed into his body, vanishing from sight.

The refinement proceeded far more smoothly than he had imagined. Yang Kai did not know whether Secret Treasures of antiquity differed from those of the present day, but he had spent only half a month to refine the Feather Spirit Arrow successfully, far less time than other Secret Treasures had required.

After refining it, Yang Kai completely comprehended the Feather Spirit Arrow’s power and its usage limitations.

Strictly speaking, the Feather Spirit Arrow possessed tremendous might. The two unknown jades set fore and aft on the shaft could accept a massive amount of Saint Yuan, compressing and condensing it within to form an exceedingly formidable strike.

When facing a powerful enemy, he need only trigger the array within to unleash the attack. Even an expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm would find it hard to bear a direct hit.

Its power was immense, but it had drawbacks as well.

Because there were only two jades on the Feather Spirit Arrow, even when fully charged it could only be used twice!

After two uses, the energy within the jades would be completely exhausted. To use it again, he would have to find an opportunity to recharge.

Even with Yang Kai’s foundations, charging a single jade would still take one hour, so in any single battle the Feather Spirit Arrow could at most be used twice.

Though there was such a limitation, it did not negate the Feather Spirit Arrow’s formidable might. At the very least, Yang Kai was thoroughly satisfied with this Secret Treasure.

Nothing in this world is perfect. The Feather Spirit Arrow’s power was already frightening enough—how could he expect it to be used without end?

He had the mind to test the Feather Spirit Arrow’s might, but there was no suitable target. Yang Kai could only give up. After walking out of that natural cave, he casually chose a direction and sped away.

For the next few days, he lingered within the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

Now that he knew the presence of ancient cultivators’ abodes here was no empty rumor—and had even reaped gains—he naturally hoped to strike while the iron was hot. After all, no one ever disliked having more good things.

Unfortunately, perhaps too many cultivators had flooded into this place. Over the next few days, though Yang Kai made discoveries from time to time, he gained nothing further—those abodes had long since been preempted by others, and their contents swept clean.

Killings for treasure occurred often; ambushes and counter-ambushes were already commonplace here.

On this day, as usual, Yang Kai took out his Transmission Compass and poured his Divine Sense into it.

Though treasure hunting within the Fallen Emperor Mountains had yielded little, he had not forgotten his original purpose in coming here. From time to time he would take out the Transmission Compass in hopes of contacting Qian Tong.

He simply did not know where Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu had gone, and Yang Kai had never been able to get his wish.

But this time seemed different. As his Divine Sense flowed in, Yang Kai quickly sensed another Divine Sense coming from within the Transmission Compass. His brows rose and he hurriedly examined it.

A moment later, he put away the compass, fixed his bearings, and shot off straight toward a certain location.

At a place one hundred thousand li from here, countless Origin Returning Realm experts had gathered, gazing at the pavilions and towers hidden within the mountain range ahead.

The ruins of an ancient Sect!

Although many cultivators were keen to search outside for the abodes of ancient warriors in hopes of gains, the intelligence-savvy great forces had committed the majority of their experts to this place.

After all, the lure of an ancient Sect’s ruins was too great. Who would not want to enter and seek out good things?

At this very moment, the grand lineup of the various great forces and numerous experts gathered here was incomparably luxurious—this time’s spectacle was even more terrifying than when the Imperial Garden opened last time.
