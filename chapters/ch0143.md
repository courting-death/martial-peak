## Chapter 143 — Certain Death?

Time seemed to freeze at that moment.

The shocked and bewildered expressions of the hundreds of onlookers had yet to regain clarity, and their gasps had just begun to escape their lips.

The crimson light left in the wake of that figure had not yet dissipated. Following the trajectory of this red light, one could clearly see from where this person had charged out and from where they had leapt to catch Su Yan, who was plummeting downwards.

A massive tortoise-shaped demon beast was charging forward like a whirlwind.

Less than a zhang in front of the tortoise-shaped demon beast, a man and a woman were tightly embraced together, as if with determination to live and die together, unwavering and resolute.

In that instant, Yang Kai and Su Yan's gazes met.

A flicker of astonishment crossed Su Yan's beautiful eyes, while Yang Kai's eyes held only a trace of pity and sorrow.

Such a gaze made Su Yan's heart tremble. No one had ever looked at her with such eyes before. Elders looked at her with appreciation and approval, peers looked at her with admiration and respect, juniors looked at her with reverence and adoration, and perhaps some might have looked at her with jealousy and envy.

But this gaze of pity and sorrow was something Su Yan had never seen in her life.

She was a daughter of heaven; no one had the right to look at her like that.

Was he pitying her? What was he grieving? This faint pain felt like a sharp needle piercing through Su Yan's frozen body and heart, causing her to feel a twinge of hurt.

In that moment, she seemed to sense why he was grieving.

But… how warm! This person's body was so warm. Throughout her life, Su Yan had never experienced such a warm feeling, as if she were about to melt. Having cultivated the Ice Heart Technique, she had frozen her body and all emotions in her world, leaving only coldness, only chill, nothing else.

Cold and warmth were originally opposing forces. She should have felt disgusted by the intense warmth radiating from him, yet why did she now feel an irresistible longing to linger? Just like this, held in his embrace, even if the sea dried up and the stones crumbled, even if the heavens fell and the earth split, she did not want to move a single finger.

Unconsciously, Su Yan tightened her grip on Yang Kai's clothing.

Time flowed once more.

“It’s Yang Kai!” Hu Jiao’er exclaimed, having not noticed when Yang Kai had dashed out. Just moments ago, she had been stunned by the astonishing technique Su Yan had displayed. By the time she regained her senses, Yang Kai's figure had already vanished from her side.

Hu Mei’er quickly covered her mouth, stifling her cry, her eyes trembling violently as she gazed at the tortoise-shaped demon beast, fearing to witness a scene she did not want to see.

“Courting death!” Long Jun snorted coldly.

In the next moment, the frozen tortoise-shaped demon beast charged towards Yang Kai's arched back. Although Yang Kai had done his utmost to shift his body and evade during his leap, his current strength was too low. He could neither fly nor fully counteract Su Yan's downward momentum, causing their bodies to freeze in mid-air for an instant.

Thus, this collision was unavoidable.

At the moment of contact between the tortoise-shaped demon beast and Yang Kai, his arched back thrust forward, using that brief moment of cushioning to minimize his injuries.

With a loud thud, Yang Kai and Su Yan were sent flying like cannonballs, hurtling dozens of zhang away before slowly descending to the ground.

The two of them tumbled together, rolling like a gourd, and only after rolling out several zhang did the force of impact gradually dissipate.

Finally, their rolling bodies came to a stop. Yang Kai was in a disheveled state, his face pale as paper, while Su Yan, pinned beneath him, was unscathed except for her pristine garments being slightly soiled and her hair in disarray.

A mouthful of fresh blood spewed from Yang Kai, nearly robbing him of all strength as he collapsed onto Su Yan's chest.

Su Yan's beautiful eyes trembled, her usually calm heart unable to maintain its tranquility at this moment. Slowly, she extended a hand, gently placing it on Yang Kai's head, as if to caress and comfort him, remaining motionless.

In that earlier tumble, Yang Kai had used his body to shield her, absorbing nearly all the residual force of the impact, while Su Yan's body had not even touched the ground.

With a screech, the frozen tortoise-shaped demon beast skidded across the ground, leaving a deep trench, sliding for dozens of zhang before finally coming to a halt, resting not far from Yang Kai and Su Yan.

The world fell into silence, everyone holding their breath, staring blankly at the couple tightly embracing on the ground.

Under normal circumstances, such a scene would surely provoke the outrage of countless onlookers.

No man could so brazenly touch Su Yan; every inch of her skin was sacred and noble, something the world could only admire from afar, not desecrate.

Yet at this moment, not only was a man lying atop her, but he had even buried his head into Su Yan's bosom, inhaling her fragrance and feeling her softness.

Despite this, no one found anything amiss.

Could one be angry at a dead man?

What was there to be angry about with a dead man? He had risked his life to save Su Yan; this was the moment of grace he should enjoy before his demise.

Everyone believed that under such a brutal impact, Yang Kai was undoubtedly doomed.

Only Jie Hongchen, upon witnessing this scene, felt his eyes redden.

The last time he had seen Yang Kai playing with Su Yan's delicate hand had already driven him to madness, haunting his mind like a nightmare. Every time he thought of it, his heart felt like it was being sliced by a knife. And now, this person had gone even further, committing such an act in public. How could he endure it?

Jie Hongchen's pent-up resentment and fury surged forth like a flood, nearly driving him to madness. His gaze fixed on Yang Kai, a thick killing intent radiating without restraint.

Lying beneath Yang Kai, Su Yan slowly raised her gaze, coldly glancing at him from over a hundred zhang away.

Jie Hongchen shivered, suddenly coming to his senses. Looking down again, he was filled with regret and remorse!

If he had recklessly saved Su Yan just now, wouldn’t he be the one enjoying such a moment? With his strength, even if he were struck by that tortoise-shaped demon beast, he would definitely not die; at most, he would be heavily injured.

Exchanging a heavily injured body for Su Yan's favor was a deal too good to pass up.

Why? Why hadn’t he reacted in time? Why had he been lost in the grand illusion of Su Yan's shadow, neglecting the danger she faced? Why hadn’t this person been affected by that illusion?

Such a golden opportunity had been wasted just like that!

The wind howled, the world turned desolate.

It tousled Su Yan's hair and fluttered Yang Kai's robes, creating a rustling sound in the fierce wind.

No one dared to step forward; everyone remained frozen in place.

Su Yan's eyes gazed up at the chaotic sky, and a soft, murmuring melody escaped her lips, a song that only Yang Kai could hear.

The song was ethereal, imbued with a hint of longing amidst its chill.

Accompanied by the song, her hand gently patted Yang Kai's head again and again, like a dutiful mother soothing her child to sleep.

Beside them, the massive tortoise-shaped demon beast raised its forelimbs, its ferocious visage frozen in ice, as if it would crush Su Yan and Yang Kai into a pulp at any moment.

This was a scene as poetic as it was beautiful, yet it exuded a tragic elegance.

As the song came to an end, Su Yan's movements halted, and she let out a soft breath, the fragrant breeze stirring Yang Kai's hair as she gently said, “Once you’ve recovered, get up.”

“What song is this?” Yang Kai remained motionless, his voice weak and genuine.

Su Yan fell silent for a long while before finally speaking, “I don’t know; it’s a tune I’ve always remembered.”

“It’s beautiful,” Yang Kai slowly raised his head, blood at the corners of his mouth, his complexion pale, his body trembling, yet he gradually managed to prop himself up.

Su Yan cast a faint glance at him, the myriad emotions that had once existed in her eyes vanishing without a trace, leaving only a bone-chilling coldness.

Yang Kai sighed softly, knowing that this senior sister had forcibly smoothed the ripples in her heart, allowing her inner lake to return to calm.

He reached out a hand, gesturing to her.

Su Yan extended her small hand, and with Yang Kai's pull, she slowly rose.

She tucked a few loose strands of hair behind her ear. At this moment, despite being covered in dust and her hair slightly disheveled, her sacred and inviolable aura remained unchanged.

“How is this possible?” The shocked exclamations finally erupted, quickly merging into a chorus as everyone looked at Yang Kai in disbelief.

This man, whom they had thought was undoubtedly doomed, was now standing up perfectly fine, albeit looking haggard and desolate, yet he showed no signs of life-threatening injuries.

Was his body made of iron? To withstand such a collision and still survive?

On the Blood Battle Gang's side, Long Jun couldn't help but be moved.

Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er also let out a heavy breath. Hu Mei’er wore a relieved smile, tears glistening at the corners of her eyes as she murmured, “So good, so good.”

As she spoke, she began to choke up, covering her mouth.

Hu Jiao’er was taken aback, wiping her own eyes, where a tear had also slipped down.

What was happening? Hu Jiao’er stood there in a daze. Although she no longer disliked Yang Kai and felt anxious about the earlier heart-stopping moment, she knew that most people's feelings mirrored her own; no one would remain indifferent.

But she shouldn’t be so overwhelmed with joy and tears for a man she wasn’t very familiar with, right?

Moreover, while she no longer disliked Yang Kai, she didn’t have any fondness for him either.

Casting a glance at her younger sister, Hu Jiao’er could almost distinctly feel her sister’s sense of relief and the relaxation following immense tension, a feeling she empathized with.

So that’s how it is! A glimmer of understanding flashed in Hu Jiao’er's eyes, mixed with a hint of confusion.

At Fengyu Tower, Fang Ziqi's eyes sparkled as he exclaimed, “Junior Sister Du, he’s not dead!”

Du Yishuang's face flushed with excitement as she patted her chest, saying, “That scared me! If he had died, it would have been such a pity; he’s actually quite a good person.”

At Lingxiao Pavilion, Jie Hongchen's expression was ashen, his eyes devoid of spirit.

He was heartbroken over having missed the opportunity, and he was consumed with jealousy over Yang Kai's fortune. He felt like a general who had suffered a crushing defeat, utterly losing the ability to think.
