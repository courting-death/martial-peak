## Chapter 1773 — Seven Luminaries Divine Light

"Uncle Ni!" Xue Yue called out excitedly from Yang Kai's back.

In a place like this there was nothing that could make one happier than seeing family; although she had felt secure when with Yang Kai, whether Ni Guang was safe remained her worry, and now that she saw Ni Guang unharmed, Xue Yue naturally let go of the fear she had been carrying.

"What's going on?" Ni Guang asked, not approaching too closely but stopping ten zhang away from Yang Kai and the others, and he eyed the Ghost Ancestor warily as he spoke.

He feared Yang Kai and Xue Yue might have been captured by the Ghost Ancestor; if that were the case, his actions would certainly be constrained.

His suspicion did not stem from malice but from common sense — the Ghost Ancestor gave the impression of a treacherous man; anyone with a bit of sense would think the same.

"You needn't worry, Uncle Ni, I'm only a little hurt, nothing serious," Xue Yue replied, sliding down from Yang Kai's back as she spoke.

Hearing this, Ni Guang's expression cleared slightly; he glanced at Yang Kai, then at Xue Yue, and finally fixed his gaze on the Ghost Ancestor to make sure the man had done nothing to Xue Yue, then clasped his hands slightly and said, "May I ask who you are, friend?"

No matter what, the Ghost Ancestor had come with Xue Yue; Ni Guang had to ask the man's identity.

The Ghost Ancestor laughed harshly, the sound grating, and said, "You don't need to ask this old man's name or origins. I have no intention of joining forces with you. Take your family's junior and do what you must; you needn't bother with me!"

He behaved as if Ni Guang were beneath his notice, his tone outrageously arrogant and repulsive.

Yang Kai rubbed his nose by the side.

Ni Guang's face darkened a little; he snorted, clearly displeased.

He held a high position in the Hengluo Commerce Guild and his renown spread across the Star Domain. Those weaker than him treated him with respect, and even peers — save a few like Zi Long — did not dare show him such rudeness. The Ghost Ancestor's words had plainly offended him.

So he immediately lost any interest in further conversation; turning a cold face to Xue Yue, he said, "Let's go!"

Xue Yue opened her mouth as if to speak, but in the end nothing came out; she only gave Yang Kai a glance and said, "Be careful yourself!"

Yang Kai smiled and nodded. "You too!"

In the current situation he could not remain with Xue Yue. She would surely stay with Ni Guang, while he would go with the Ghost Ancestor.

"Yang Kai, aren't you coming?" Luo Lan, as if having perceived something, asked in surprise.

Yang Kai shook his head, hesitated, then said, "I have matters to attend to with this Elder, Elder Luo. The agreement I made with you earlier may have to be voided; if there is an opportunity in the future, I will make it up to you."

"Is that so..." Luo Lan smiled and said, "No matter. This time it was my own failure to make full preparations that caused you trouble. Since you have a benefactor now... I wish you luck!"

She was easily agreeable and showed no sign of blame for Yang Kai's sudden change of plans.

"Youngster, plotting with a tiger will end badly; think it through," Ni Guang said coldly, casting Yang Kai a warning glance.

"Thank you for your concern, Elder, I understand!" Yang Kai clasped his fist in salute.

The Ghost Ancestor continued to laugh oddly from the side, his presence ever more suggestive of ill intent.

Ni Guang and Luo Lan led Xue Yue back toward where they had been; along the way Ni Guang naturally asked about what had happened after they parted. Xue Yue did not say much, only telling Ni Guang that she and Yang Kai had struggled hard to rid themselves of the Illusory Void Butterfly and then had encountered the Ghost Ancestor.

As for what had occurred within the spatial rift, Xue Yue did not dare to speak of it.

"This man is called the Ghost Ancestor?" Ni Guang frowned. "How is it I have never heard of such a person in the Star Domain? Elder Luo, have you heard of him?"

"I have not heard of him either," Luo Lan replied, shaking her head.

"Strange. A Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert — how could such a one remain obscure? Especially with such a peculiar aura..." Ni Guang could not make sense of why he had never heard the name Ghost Ancestor before; the man seemed to have leapt out of nowhere, appearing without warning and astonishing everyone.

"Uncle Ni, what's the situation here?" Xue Yue interjected at an opportune moment.

"The situation is not promising," Ni Guang said, glancing toward a spot ahead. "That Kong Fa bastard followed Elder Luo and me all the way to this Medicine Valley; once he arrived he used secret techniques to summon Xu Wei over. Zi Long already had the location of this Medicine Valley, and Old man Meng Tong somehow got wind of it and came here as well."

"Meng Tong?" Xue Yue frowned, looking in the direction he indicated and finding a short, elderly man squinting and looking around like a thief — a comical sight.

Yet the man was a genuine Void King Realm expert; though only of the first stage, he stood at the pinnacle of that stage.

Rumor had it Meng Tong had ascended to the Void King Realm a thousand years ago but had never broken through to the Second Stage; should he be given an opportunity, the breakthrough would take but the blink of an eye.

Meng Tong's origins were mysterious; no one knew where he came from, and he did not attach himself to any great power, always cultivating alone.

An unaffiliated martial artist faces immense difficulty in reaching high levels; with no one to teach them they must grope forward on their own and are likely to err and fall short.

Moreover, unaffiliated fighters lack resources behind them; all they need for cultivation must be found themselves, which wastes time.

Thus such practitioners generally do not achieve great heights; to reach the Origin Returning Realm was already a notable accomplishment.

Yet Meng Tong was a Void King Realm master — clearly fortune and opportunity had favored him, and paired with his perseverance and comprehension, gave rise to his present achievements.

So while Meng Tong's cultivation was not the absolute peak in the Star Domain, his reputation was considerable.

Those unaffiliated martial artists regarded him as a goal and an object of admiration, and that constituency was vast.

Purple Star, the Sword Alliance, the Hengluo Commerce Guild... the great powers of the Star Domain had all extended offers to Meng Tong, promising riches and elder status, but Meng Tong had accepted none and remained solitary, never taking disciples.

In a sense, he was another legend within the Star Domain.

He neither made enemies nor grew overly close to any power, and lived a comfortable life.

At times Ni Guang even envied a life like Meng Tong's, though if truly asked to abandon everything to live as Meng Tong did, he suspected he would not be willing.

Among the warriors who entered the Lost Realm this time, Meng Tong was indeed present, and even reached the location of the Treasure Vault; whatever path had brought him here, his luck was considerable.

Counting Meng Tong and the newly arrived Ghost Ancestor, there were as many as seven Void King Realm experts present!

That number accounted for at least sixty to seventy percent of those who had entered the Lost Realm; if one counted those who had died within the Lost Realm as well, the Void King Realm experts at the Medicine Valley might constitute eighty percent of the survivors still alive!

Ni Guang gestured toward the vast valley ahead and said, "The spiritual medicines on the outskirts of the Medicine Valley have already been divided."

"They're already divided?" Xue Yue exclaimed in astonishment. "What was the harvest like?"

Ni Guang gave a slight smile. "Not bad — though there weren't many, every one of them was a treasure."

As they spoke, Luo Lan checked her Spatial Ring, as if she had found much.

"The remaining spiritual medicines are hidden inside, but for now we cannot enter!" Ni Guang continued.

Xue Yue stared at the huge valley ahead and saw it shrouded in a dazzling seven-colored light that flowed like water, filling the valley and making the vast Medicine Valley appear as though covered by a tide of color.

From that seemingly solidified light, Xue Yue sensed a lethal threat.

"Seven Luminaries Divine Light?" Xue Yue's face darkened as she uttered the name of that seven-colored glow.

Given her status and position, she clearly knew some of the Medicine Valley's circumstances.

"Indeed!" Ni Guang nodded lightly. "This is the Seven Luminaries Divine Light born when that divine bird — the Seven Luminaries Peacock — breathed. Such a thing disregards any defense; neither secret treasures nor secret techniques nor Divine Sense have any effect upon it. Once enveloped, no matter how high one's cultivation, one will soon perish — it is dreadfully terrifying!"

"Then how can we possibly get in?" Luo Lan asked, anxious; though she had followed Ni Guang here and had some gains, she remained ignorant of the valley's deeper truths.

She had heard neither of the Seven Luminaries Peacock nor the Seven Luminaries Divine Light before; knowing that even Ni Guang felt powerless against such radiance, she was well aware she had no means to dispel it.

"Wait!" Ni Guang said in a grave voice. "This Treasure Light fills the air when the divine bird breathes out; when it inhales and draws the light back we can enter. Inside the Medicine Valley the spatial rifts are numerous; though dangerous everywhere, those rifts are the best natural shields. When it breathes out again and spits forth the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, we only need to find a spatial rift, hide behind it, and rely on the rift's presence to evade..."

Hearing this, Luo Lan's face registered sudden comprehension.

While he was explaining, Ni Guang suddenly knitted his brows and looked at Xue Yue with a grave expression.

"What is it?" Xue Yue asked, baffled.

Ni Guang said nothing; he focused on a strand of her hair and after a moment snorted coldly, clenching his teeth as he hissed, "Despicable!"

As he spoke, he flicked out a pure thread of force with his finger toward Xue Yue.
