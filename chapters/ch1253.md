## Chapter 1253 — Demon Blood Threads Secret Technique

Yang Kai knew better than anyone the logic of cutting out the root; if it were possible, he would have killed Deng Ning as well. Yet Deng Ning's earlier declaration — that even if he died he would pull Ye Yangrong down with him — stirred something faint in Yang Kai.

A man who doesn't even care for his own life can be trusted, at least a little.

Asking Deng Ning for a reward was merely an excuse — after all, he had no desire to make a move for no reason. The only reason he killed An Zhiyong earlier was because the man had attacked first.

As for whatever reward Deng Ning offered, whether precious or paltry, Yang Kai did not care.

Unexpectedly, when Yang Kai said this, Deng Ning's face brightened. He pondered for a moment, then said in a low voice, "The Demon Blood Threads secret technique — I wonder if my friend is interested?"

"Deng Ning!" Before Yang Kai could answer, Ye Yangrong screamed as if possessed, his face full of disbelief. "How dare you casually leak our Sect's secret technique! Do you know what fate will befall you if the Elders learn of this?"

Deng Ning turned his head and gave him a cold, sinister smile. “Nothing more than extracting the soul and refining the spirit—what’s there to be so shocked about?”

His completely indifferent expression left Ye Yangrong momentarily at a loss for words.

Deng Ning shook his head and sneered, "Besides, as long as Senior Brother Ye dies here, who would ever know I leaked the Sect's secret technique?"

Ye Yangrong's face drained of color; only then did he realize to what depths Deng Ning hated him, that he would violate the Demon Blood Sect's prohibitions and use the Demon Blood Threads secret technique to lure someone into aiding him. If the man truly agreed without hesitation, Ye would have no chance of survival. Thinking quickly, he urged Yang Kai, "Friend, do not lightly trust Deng Ning's words. Our Demon Blood Threads technique is indeed formidable and disallowed to non-core disciples, but you have never practiced our Sect's methods; the technique would be of no use to you. Moreover, if you obtain such a technique, our higher-ups will never ignore it. Once the matter leaks out, you will have nowhere to turn — death certain!"

As he spoke, a flash of insight struck Ye Yangrong. He suddenly seemed to remember something; his face grew even paler. Looking at Deng Ning, he trembled, "So this is the scheme you've been plotting!"

Deng Ning chuckled. Seeing that Ye Yangrong finally understood, he no longer tried to hide. Instead he said to Yang Kai, "Friend, I don't know your name or origin, I only seek to kill this man. Revealing the Demon Blood Threads secret technique to you does carry a risk for you, but the same is true for me. If this is exposed, I will suffer torments far worse than you — a thousandfold. So I absolutely will not betray you. Friend, you can act with peace of mind, right?"

Deng Ning's mind was razor-sharp; he had apparently seen through Yang Kai's intent to wipe them all out, so he used the Demon Blood Threads technique to bind himself to Yang Kai.

Once Yang Kai agreed, Deng Ning could not betray him — betraying Yang Kai would be tantamount to suicide. This was his twisted way of showing good faith. And of course, he had considered that the Demon Blood Threads technique might be useless to Yang Kai.

Seeing Yang Kai hesitate, Deng Ning steeled himself and raised the price further. "If my friend still isn't satisfied, I can..."

"No need. The Demon Blood Threads technique will do." Yang Kai cut him off. He had seen through Deng Ning's intent; such petty tricks meant little to him. Deng Ning's desperate gamble left Yang Kai indifferent.

At Yang Kai's nod, Ye Yangrong went ashen instantly, while Deng Ning rejoiced beyond measure.

"Do it."

Deng Ning was momentarily stunned; thinking Yang Kai would assist him, he didn't ask further. He shifted his stance, blood qi roaring within him, a blood light flaring. He bit his tongue and spat a spray of blood-fog that writhed like a living thing, swiftly coalescing into a short spear. Grasping it with one hand, Deng Ning surged before Ye Yangrong, his face feral as he drove the spear forward.

What shocked him beyond measure happened: he clearly saw Ye Yangrong attempt to dodge, but for some reason his Senior Brother's face showed only a sudden prickle of pain; his Saint Yuan halted for an instant and his body froze in place.

Deng Ning's spear easily pierced through the other's heart and came out through the other side.

Blood sprayed. Terror and disbelief filled Ye Yangrong's face. Grasping the blood-colored short spear, he seemed to try to pull it from his body, but his strength rapidly drained and in a blink his life faded.

Deng Ning stood stunned until Ye Yangrong's corpse fell from the air and struck the ground with a sound, which snapped him out of his daze.

He was certain that his Senior Brother's inability to resist his strike must have been due to some trick performed by that Saint King Second Stage youth.

Could the other have such an ability?

Deng Ning considered himself not weak, yet he had no idea when the other manipulated events or what he had done, and still had muddledly won the duel. If that youth wished to turn on him, a blink would be enough to annihilate him.

The thought sent cold sweat across Deng Ning's body and left him inexplicably shaken.

When he saw Yang Kai kill An Zhiyong earlier, he already suspected the man was an elite of some force, but only now did he realize the man was a fiend.

Thoughts racing, Deng Ning turned and, his face outwardly calm though his eyes brimming with deep fear, laughed aloud as he flew down from high above and proactively approached Yang Kai, cupping his fists. "Friend, thank you. Seeing you here in the Flowing Flame Sandland, I suspected you were no ordinary person, and now I see I was right!"

Yang Kai nodded faintly and stayed silent.

Unable to read Yang Kai's emotions, Deng Ning grew nervous, unsure of the man's temperament and fearful he might say something offending. Hastily recalling their agreement, he rummaged through his Spatial Ring and produced a beast-skin bound manual, handing it over respectfully with both hands. "This records the Demon Blood Threads secret technique. My achievements are slight; I never obtained the complete manual — only the upper half, and it was copied, not an original. But it does not differ from the upper half of the original at all..."

As he spoke, Deng Ning carefully observed Yang Kai's expression.

After all, the payment he now offered differed somewhat from their earlier agreement, so he was uneasy.

Yang Kai glanced up at him, said nothing, and tucked the manual away into his Spatial Ring without even looking at it. To him, half a Demon Blood Threads manual was no different from a whole one — besides, he had no real intention of cultivating what it contained, so Deng Ning's concealment was of little concern.

Seeing Yang Kai store the manual and not press the issue, Deng Ning finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"Does your Demon Blood Sect allow disciples to copy such secret techniques?" Yang Kai asked with a faint, unreadable smile.

Deng Ning chuckled lowly. "Of course not, but I have had a photographic memory since childhood, so... friend, you understand."

Yang Kai's face lit with comprehension.

"May I ask your esteemed surname?" Deng Ning asked, his expression turning serious.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, then gave his name.

Deng Ning nodded. "I am Deng Ning, a disciple of the Demon Blood Sect. Brother Yang must already know. Rest assured — what transpired here is known only to Heaven, Earth, you, and me. No third party will learn of it, otherwise I will suffer the backlash of inner demons and never ascend to the Origin Returning Realm!"

Hearing such a venomous oath, Yang Kai regarded him with mild surprise. Though the vow seemed casually uttered, failure to keep it would create an obstacle in Deng Ning's heart that might trigger inner demons when attempting a breakthrough.

So one could trust it.

"I'm not worried. But you... two of your fellow disciples died here — that might cause trouble, no?" Yang Kai glanced at the two corpses.

Deng Ning was stunned, looking at Yang Kai oddly before cautiously asking, "Is this your first time hearing of our Demon Blood Sect, Brother Yang?"

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai frowned.

Deng Ning did not play coy and hurriedly explained, "It seems Brother Yang truly has never heard of the Demon Blood Sect. No wonder. Don't worry — two dead disciples are no big deal. Our Sect does not forbid our killing each other; we even encourage it. We have many disciples; a few deaths mean nothing."

Yang Kai listened, his eyes nearly bulging.

The world truly harbors everything; there could be such a cold-blooded sect, and it still persisted — astonishing.

Deng Ning's words flowed on as if a box had opened. "Our Sect has small internal upheavals every five years, great ones every ten. Each time it's internal strife and rivers of blood; many die. In this regard we are known across the Dark Star."

"Then why hasn't your Sect been wiped out?" Yang Kai asked in puzzlement.

"You jest, Brother Yang..." Deng Ning's mouth twitched. "Because our teachings encourage slaughter, and internal strife can cause those who survive to grow greatly in strength. After each upheaval countless disciples break their shackles and ascend to the next realm. So our Sect has never been wiped out."

He forced a strained smile and explained patiently.

Yang Kai was baffled and tired of probing. Instead he asked, "So this place is the Demon Blood Sect's territory?"

"Yes."

"How far is it from Tianyun City?"

"Tianyun City?" Deng Ning started in surprise, then suddenly realized. "Ah — so Brother Yang is a disciple of Yingyue Hall! No wonder your methods are so formidable; I admire you."
