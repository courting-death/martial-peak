## Chapter 984 — You Got Lost Too?

On the Tongxuan Continent, Secret Treasures with spatial properties are generally just Spatial Pouches.

Only a few leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan possess spatial rings, and those were forged back when the Great Demon God used scraps from the Soul-Calming Stone—only two or three in total.

Those two or three rings are worth who knows how many times more than ordinary Spatial Pouches.

Yet Yang Kai discovered that the first person he met in the starry void carried a bracelet-shaped Secret Treasure; there was no doubt that this bracelet-form Secret Treasure was at least as valuable as the rings held by the Ancient Demon Clan's leaders, perhaps even more so.

Could these bracelet-shaped Secret Treasures be as common in the vast starry void as Star Shuttles?

Yang Kai quietly studied the younger beauty's wrist and saw she wasn't wearing a bracelet, but she did have a ring on her index finger that gave off the same energy fluctuations as a bracelet.

Sure enough, she too possessed a Secret Treasure of a higher grade than a Spatial Pouch.

What puzzled Yang Kai, though, was that their Secret Treasures were not made from Soul-Calming Stone, but from some other unknown material.

"What are you staring at? Sneaking around like that—how hateful." He Miao saw Yang Kai's eyes darting about and, misunderstanding his intentions, scolded him with a sour expression.

"Sorry." Yang Kai put on a serious face and slowly shook his head. "I really don't know anything about Star Charts, and I've never heard of them."

"Never heard of them?" Even the elder beauty's face registered disbelief, a flash of annoyance rising on her delicate features.

"Sister, stop wasting words on him; he's clearly from over there. If we stall here we might expose ourselves. Grab his Star Chart and get out of here—don't forget, even someone at the First Stage of the Saint Realm wouldn't be a match for us."

The elder beauty's expression showed interest, but she didn't move immediately; she hesitated.

She was clearly not an unreasonable person.

"Wait!" Yang Kai raised his hand and called out, "Shouldn't you explain what this Star Chart actually is? I really haven't heard of it."

Seeing Yang Kai's serious expression, the elder beauty couldn't help but feel a prick of doubt.

Although Yang Kai's words were oddly fabricated, if someone could lie to such an extent it would be astonishing; from his expression and the fluctuations in his divine sense she could detect no flaw.

"Where did you come from?" the elder beauty asked after a moment's thought.

"Can I not say?" Yang Kai frowned. He had come alone into the starry void partly to search for Su Yan's whereabouts and partly to try to find a way out for the Tongxuan Continent's future.

Compared with the vast starry void, the Tongxuan Continent was too remote; if it were exposed, it might attract the covetousness of certain experts.

So Yang Kai did not want to mention the name of the Tongxuan Continent.

"I can only say I'm from a small place," Yang Kai shrugged.

"A low-tier continent?" the elder beauty arched a brow. She seemed to believe him—only someone from a lower-tier continent would not know what a Star Chart was.

"Something like that." Yang Kai went along with her assumption.

"If it's convenient, may I see your Star Shuttle?" the elder beauty asked.

"Sure." Yang Kai smiled. Under his divine sense, the Star Shuttle beneath his feet turned into a streak of cyan light and flew directly to her.

Yang Kai hovered in midair.

Although their contact was brief and they had said little, and despite not knowing the two women's true natures, Yang Kai felt they probably weren't unreasonable—otherwise, given their cultivation, they would have attacked him outright.

They had no reason to quibble with him.

The elder beauty raised her hand and took the Star Shuttle, yet instead of inspecting the flying Secret Treasure the two sisters stared at him in bewilderment.

Astonishment flashed in both their eyes.

Yang Kai looked himself over from head to toe and found nothing out of the ordinary; he couldn't understand why they looked as if they'd seen a ghost.

"Sister, this man has no Star Shuttle shielding him and yet he hasn't even deployed a defensive Secret Treasure—can he withstand the pressure of the starry sky? Isn't he only at the First Stage of the Saint Realm?" He Miao whispered in awe.

"He isn't circulating internal power either..." the elder beauty's feelings trembled; "is his body really that strong?"

“Could he be concealing his cultivation, and in truth be an expert above the Saint King Realm?” He Miao suggested a possibility. As soon as the words left her lips, her pretty face immediately turned pale.

"Doesn't seem like it..."

The two sisters muttered to each other in tiny voices; Yang Kai, not knowing what they were saying, couldn't help but shout, "Are you finished yet?"

The elder beauty was startled and suddenly remembered she still held his Star Shuttle. She quickly probed its interior with her divine sense, then slowly shook her head at her sister with a disappointed expression.

She returned the Star Shuttle to Yang Kai and, with a strange look, asked, "How did you get here without a Star Chart?"

"I drifted with the Meteorite Sea, following traces of where living creatures had been, and before I knew it I was here," Yang Kai explained.

"You are bold!" the elder beauty couldn't help but admire. "And you're lucky too—to rely on a somewhat damaged Star Shuttle to make it here."

"A damaged Star Shuttle?" Yang Kai was taken aback. "It runs smoothly enough—where's the damage?"

"Because you don't know about the existence of Star Charts, I can't explain it to you," the elder beauty said with a sigh.

"Fine." Yang Kai didn't press it, smiling lightly. "But it seems you've been satisfied—though I did nothing to help, now it's your turn to help me."

The elder beauty shook her head. "If you want us to point you a way out, you'll be disappointed—we can't help you."

She seemed to understand what Yang Kai wanted from her.

Yang Kai's expression darkened.

"Because we've been lost here for a long time," the elder beauty said somewhat awkwardly.

"That's why we asked you for a Star Chart," the younger He Miao interjected. "We can only leave with a correct Star Chart, and your Star Shuttle's interior is in chaos—there's no Star Chart at all."

"You two are lost too?" Yang Kai almost laughed. After all his hardships traveling from the Tongxuan Continent to get here, he'd finally met two living people and thought his luck was good, only to find they were no different from him.

Still, listening to their back-and-forth, Yang Kai managed to piece together some useful information.

Star Charts were likely maps that guided martial artists along correct routes through the starry sky, and those charts were surely stored inside Star Shuttles.

Yang Kai suddenly recalled that when he had refined the Star Shuttle, he had indeed seen a vast starry sky inside it, as if shrunk countless times and placed within.

"Yes, we're lost—what's so funny?" the elder beauty snapped, her pride wounded by Yang Kai's half-smile.

Yang Kai straightened his expression and asked earnestly, "How did you get lost?"

“Our Star Shuttle’s Star Chart was damaged, so we’ve been unable to find our way. For any cultivator traveling through the Starry Void, this is a fatal threat. If the Star Chart had been damaged elsewhere, we might still have been able to find our way back, but here it’s different.”

"Why is it different here?"

"Look at you—so ignorant. You truly know nothing about the starry void," the elder beauty said impatiently, not willing to explain further. She extended a slender finger and flicked out a small white orb of light that drifted toward Yang Kai like a firefly.

"See for yourself; it contains some basic knowledge. I hope you can find a way to survive. Farewell." Saying that, she piloted her Star Shuttle and sped past Yang Kai.

He Miao stood behind her sister, stuck out her tongue at Yang Kai, and in the blink of an eye the two disappeared.

Yang Kai shook his head and did not stop them.

Since the two were lost and couldn't find their way, there was no point in pressing further.

He drew the white orb the elder sister had released into his Sea of Consciousness and began to probe it carefully.

The orb was a fragment of their Divine Sense power and carried some information, though not much.

But the information it contained was vital to Yang Kai at this point.

It explained the function of Star Charts: as Yang Kai had guessed, they were indeed used to guide martial artists along correct flight routes through the starry sky.

When a martial artist wanted to travel from one continent to another across a great distance, they would purchase a Star Chart; each chart was different and was created by a high-level expert using divine sense.

These purchased Star Charts could be stored inside Star Shuttles; the martial artist only needed to circulate internal power to activate the chart, and the Star Shuttle would then follow the route carved by the chart, advancing safely, avoiding many hidden dangers, and could even move automatically without the martial artist needing to adjust course.

The Star Charts inside Star Shuttles could be replaced or erased.

Their many benefits were too numerous to list.

Only then did Yang Kai understand the importance of Star Charts and why the two sisters had immediately tried to take his.

Yet his Star Shuttle had been acquired by accident and had drifted in the starry sky for an unknown length of time; even if it once contained a Star Chart, it had likely long since vanished.

The miniature starry void contained within was also in chaos and could not store new Star Charts.

That was why the elder had said his Star Shuttle was somewhat damaged.

Besides explanations about Star Charts and Star Shuttles, the information the elder sister transmitted also contained clues about this place.

The Chaos Abyss!

This revelation astonished Yang Kai—he had even felt like staying here to cultivate under the beautiful starry sky, yet this place was an extremely dangerous area known among starry void cultivators as the Chaos Abyss.

The enormous, beautiful nearby stars not only exuded extremely dense energy but also emitted horribly twisted, chaotic domain fields; these countless domain fields intertwined to the point where anyone who entered would lose their sense of direction, forever confined to the area covered by the chaotic fields, unable to escape that invisible prison.
