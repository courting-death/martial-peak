## Chapter 794 — Sacred Tomb

As he spoke, the assembly fell abruptly silent, each heart struck with shock.

Before it was said aloud no one had grasped it, but now that they considered it, everyone found it astonishing—cultivated only to the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm, yet he had escaped death time and again; either his luck defied the heavens or he possessed extraordinary methods.

Most believed the latter, which only made Yang Kai's true depths harder to fathom.

The Sacred Land's Saint Lords varied before succession—some had great cultivation, others meager, some excellent aptitude, others poor.

Even if this generation's Saintess had found someone only at the Divine Roaming Realm, they were confident they could train him into a top expert—let alone Yang Kai, whose starting aptitude and strength exceeded their expectations by a hundredfold.

"No matter what, he must assume the position of Saint Lord! Without the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring, many places in our Sacred Land cannot be opened; we cannot delay this!" Xu Hui said at once, his face tightening with resolve.

"But he doesn't want it, does he?" Yu Ying frowned, feeling troubled.

"He may not want it, but he must be made to accept it! We have so many Saint Realm experts—surely one lone man shouldn't be beyond us?" Shi Kun said impatiently.

"Are you planning to force him?" Yu Ying's phoenix-like eyes narrowed, she fixed Shi Kun with a cold stare.

"That's my meaning as well!" Xu Hui inhaled lightly. "His stance has been stubborn; waiting longer will do no good. Rather than dither, we'd better take a risk—send him into the Sacred Tomb!"

The moment those words fell, every brow twitched; it seemed the Sacred Tomb held unparalleled peril, and even the Saint Realm masters present shuddered in dread.

"What if... he doesn't come back?" Cheng Yuetong said, voice tinged with worry. "This generation only has Ling'er as the Saintess now; since she has already made her pick, she won't go seek another. If he fails to return..."

"If he cannot return, our Sacred Land will have no choice but to seal itself... and wait for the next Saintess to mature."

The next Saintess hasn't been chosen yet; to cultivate a replacement would take at least twenty years. Twenty years may seem short, but without a master to inherit the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring taken into the Sacred Tomb with the old Saint Lord, many functions would grind to a halt. Those twenty years could well be enough to bring a leviathan to ruin.

They could not afford to wait, so for the past two months they had acted with extreme caution—but Yang Kai's determination forced Xu Hui to give the matter serious thought.

"But he still hasn't fully comprehended the Nine Heavens Divine Technique; how could he enter? It is said the Sacred Tomb is where the Nine Heavens Divine Technique was born—mastery of it is required to enter."

"He's grasped three moves—it's enough. This is for the benefit of our Sacred Land. Even if he is to be the future Saint Lord, sacrifices must be made when necessary!" Xu Hui barked. "If he emerges safely, he will no doubt be grateful for our decision today!"

"Indeed!" Shi Kun and Meng Tianfei and the others nodded in agreement.

Never had a Saint Lord who emerged from the Sacred Tomb failed to feel a bond with the Sacred Land. Those Saint Lords brought back by Saintesses and who devoted their lives to the Land, pouring their hearts and minds into it, were tied to secrets within the Sacred Tomb.

Though no one knew exactly what lay hidden in the Tomb, they believed without doubt.

The two middle-aged beauties, Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong, glanced away; though secretly worried, they said no more.

With the discussion concluded, everyone hurried to prepare for Yang Kai's entry into the Sacred Tomb.

The next day, Yang Kai, who had been sitting in the palace cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes; in his senses, Xu Hui and the others seemed to have come again.

This time, however, it was different: more people had come than the few he usually saw, including several he had never met.

Though they hid well, their breaths and auras carried a hint of solemnity, which put Yang Kai on guard—he couldn't tell what schemes they plotted.

A moment later there was a knock at the door. Yang Kai replied idly, and the door was pushed open; Xu Hui and all the elder protectors had arrived.

Yang Kai raised a brow, sensing Xu Hui likely meant to speak of Saint Lord matters; otherwise they would not have summoned all the Sacred Land's experts.

After brief pleasantries, Xu Hui introduced the few people Yang Kai had not met; Yang Kai nodded and greeted them.

"Elder, what business brings you today?" Yang Kai's eyes gleamed; he asked directly.

"We wish to invite you to accompany us to a place," Xu Hui said with a mild, friendly smile.

"I've toured all the nine peaks; there shouldn't be anywhere left to visit, right?"

"There are places the young do not see. The place we're going is one of those secrets."

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed slightly. "If it's a secret, isn't it unwise to let outsiders in?"

"You're not an outsider, and besides, no one but you can enter it," Xu Hui said seriously.

"Oh? If no one but me can enter, then isn't that a place only a Saint Lord should have access to? Heh—this is not something I can refuse, is it?"

Xu Hui's expression turned awkward; he cupped his fist. "We ask for your understanding, and that you accompany us."

Yang Kai snorted softly, his gaze sweeping the Saint Realm masters before him; he briefly calculated his odds of breaking free if he tried—then dismissed the notion.

There were simply too many of them, each a Saint Realm master; even if he showed his full strength he could not escape.

With that in mind his expression relaxed and he shrugged. "Then—lead the way. I'll go with you."

At his words the assembly brightened. Xu Hui smiled broadly and hurried, "Please!"

He had presumed the day would be awkward with the future Saint Lord and had resolved that if the other resisted they would forcibly take him into the Sacred Tomb, even at the cost of offending him.

He had not expected Yang Kai to be so compliant; it spared him considerable embarrassment. After all, the future Saint Lord might trouble him later if offended now.

Once outside the palace, the group surrounded Yang Kai and swiftly flew toward a mountain peak. Though they seemed to follow casually, they had in fact sealed off all escape routes—if Yang Kai showed any sign of trouble, they could restrain him in an instant.

"Elder, can you tell me what place we're headed to this time?" Yang Kai asked on the way.

Xu Hui hesitated briefly before answering, "To the Sacred Tomb!"

"The Sacred Tomb?" Yang Kai was surprised. "Sounds like a burial place."

"Indeed," Xu Hui nodded gravely. "When our Sacred Land's Saint Lords perceive their end is near, they enter the Sacred Tomb to await death. It is indeed a burial place—the tomb of our Sacred Land's Saint Lords through the ages!"

"Dangerous then?" Yang Kai asked with a smiling face, as if merely curious.

"Dangerous for us—any who are not a Saint Lord will die within. But for you, young brother, it will be the final test!"

"How so?"

Xu Hui's expression flickered with hesitation.

Yang Kai cut in at once, "If you won't say, don't—I'm not fond of others' secrets, especially great ones. The more one knows, the more perilous it becomes."

Xu Hui gave an embarrassed smile. "It's not that we cannot say... At this point I won't hide it from you. You may know Saint Lords were always brought back by Saintesses, but you might not know that a Saintess never brings back only one. Each generation has several Saintesses; each, guided by her own sight and the resonance of her methods, finds suitable candidates and brings them to the Sacred Land. Through the Saintesses' instruction they comprehend the Nine Heavens Divine Technique, then enter the Sacred Tomb. Only whoever can emerge from the Tomb alive is truly chosen as Saint Lord."

"So I am rather lucky—no one competes with me this time," Yang Kai said with a mocking tone.

Xu Hui gave a dry laugh. "You could put it that way."

"What's inside there?" Yang Kai demanded, his face cold.

"I do not know... I only know it's where the Saint Lords met their end. Beyond that, nothing—neither the protectors nor the elders know, because only those who have comprehended the Nine Heavens Divine Technique have the qualification to enter."

"So the Nine Heavens Divine Technique is the key to entry?" Yang Kai mused.

"Perhaps. What is certain is that it is not safe. When you enter you'll have to be careful—do not suffer any misfortune."

Cheng Yuetong suddenly added, "Though perilous, there are great benefits."

"Benefits?" Yang Kai glanced at her, suddenly interested. "Speak plainly—what sort of benefits?"

Cheng Yuetong pursed her lips and smiled. "How would I know? Only that the old Saint Lord chose to cultivate there, and every time he emerged his strength had increased. It's said when he entered he gained considerable harvests."

"Indeed. The old Saint Lord's secret treasure was brought from the Tomb—that is a Saint-Grade Upper-Level treasure, scarcely found in the world!"

"Each generation's Saint Lord uses a fine treasure; all are buried with them in the Tomb. It depends on your fate—you might obtain a treasure suitable to you there." Xu Hui said with a smile.

"A Saint-Grade Upper-Level treasure? Say so earlier and I would have entered long ago—no need for your soft and hard persuasion!" Yang Kai suddenly brightened.

The assembly was stunned.

"I love adventure most of all," Yang Kai grinned, a strange gleam lighting his face. "The more dangerous the place, the more I want to challenge it—especially a burial place like the Sacred Tomb!"

Xu Hui's face twitched; he found Yang Kai increasingly inscrutable.
