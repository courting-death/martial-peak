## Chapter 509 — Not Enough

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, even the usually good-tempered Kang Zhan let out a cold snort: “What a blatant lie!”

Agreeing to this proposal was simply because he did not want to provoke Yang Kai. In Kang Zhan’s eyes, he was doing Yang Kai a favor, giving him face, yet Yang Kai actually claimed it was for their own good.

This kind of ingratiating and shameless talk naturally enraged him.

Without further ado, Kang Zhan waved his hand, “Brother Xiang, Brother Nan, have your men move out.”

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng nodded, and in the next moment, two azure streaks shot out from the crowd.

Their speed was swift; in the blink of an eye, they had reached Yang Kai and the others. One hailed from the Xiang Family, the other from the Nan Family, both old men at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm.

If it were not for Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng’s fervent pleas for aid from their families, the Xiang and Nan Families would never have sent such experts to participate in the Succession War.

Without any courtesy, the two immediately targeted Ying Jiu.

Ferocious attacks poured down like an overwhelming wave, determined to deal Ying Jiu a devastating blow in one stroke.

The two Divine Roaming Realm peak masters’ strikes were extraordinary. In an instant, Lingxiao Pavilion’s people felt as if heaven and earth were collapsing.

The unparalleled force unleashed seemed to create a whirlpool intent on sucking souls in.

Everyone was horrified, their faces pale. Under such overwhelming power, not a single member of Lingxiao Pavilion could even entertain the thought of resistance.

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu sneered with pride, secretly expecting the moment Ying Jiu would be forced to unleash the Blood Fury Technique.

Ying Jiu remained indifferent. Just as the brutal attack was about to close in, he suddenly vanished.

The Xiang and Nan experts were startled, instantly losing their target. An unpleasant feeling swept over them.

They hastily stepped back, but a killing intent suddenly struck from behind.

A figure, moving too fast for the naked eye to trace, wielded two gleaming daggers, striking from behind.

Shadow Dance Kill!

The void was filled with wild energy, rippling like waves cast into a lake.

Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng’s triumphant expressions instantly froze. Their eyes trembled violently as they stared incredulously at the sky.

Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru were similarly stunned.

Everyone trembled at Ying Jiu’s formidable display of strength.

Yang Kai let out a light laugh and said coldly, “Senior Uncles, Senior Brothers, please step back a little.”

“Oh.” The few senior aunts and uncles snapped out of their daze. They realized that even if they joined the fray among these three Divine Roaming Realm peak masters, it would only result in needless deaths and no real effect. So they wisely led everyone away without delay.

Only Yang Kai and Su Yan stood side by side in place.

The wind blew, stirring Su Yan’s long hair, partially concealing her face. She turned her head to meet Yang Kai’s gaze. The two exchanged a knowing smile.

Swish, swish, swish.

The three engaged in fierce battle in the sky parted, facing each other clearly.

Ying Jiu’s expression remained cold and unyielding. Not a scratch marred his body.

In contrast, the experts from the Xiang and Nan Families showed sullen faces, their clothes torn in many places. Though uninjured, this exchange made everyone realize that Ying Jiu was no longer the man he had been before.

It also revealed just how terrifying the combat prowess of Yang Family Blood Servants was!

Invincible among peers, often breaking through rank barriers—this was the hallmark of the Yang Family Blood Servants!

“Two aren’t enough!” Ying Jiu shook his head as he lightly wielded his two daggers, chilling and laconic.

These words darkened the faces of the two experts.

“Brother Kang,” Qiu Ziru said with concern, “Ying Jiu seems to have reached the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm!” In their original plan, deploying two Divine Roaming Realm peaks to stall Ying Jiu meant that without this mighty support, the others could take down Yang Kai. But now, Ying Jiu at the Ninth Stage threw their plan into disarray.

“If two aren’t enough, then send more up.” Kang Zhan remained momentarily stunned, then coldly responded.

Qiu Ziru nodded and signaled several strong fighters within their faction. Those men immediately flew up to stand behind the Xiang and Nan experts.

Two Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage, two Seventh Stage!

Including the two Ninth Stage masters before, six faced Ying Jiu alone. Still, Ying Jiu’s expression was unfazed. Those four who had just arrived looked uneasy.

“Still not enough!” Ying Jiu shook his head once more. “Want to hold me? Bring on more people.”

Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru’s faces turned cold. They thought Ying Jiu was overly arrogant. Even if he were a Yang Family Blood Servant at the Ninth Stage, in the end, he was just one man.

“Blood Fury Technique!” Ying Jiu suddenly let out a deep roar. His Qi and blood surged wildly, and his True Yuan fluctuated violently.

Everyone’s expressions changed drastically—no one expected Ying Jiu would so decisively unleash the Blood Servants’ forbidden technique.

This secret method forcibly heightens the power of Qi and blood at the cost of one’s own life force! Each use shortens the user’s lifespan considerably.

Hence, no matter how powerful, Yang Family Blood Servants rarely live long.

In just the blink of an eye, Ying Jiu’s aura transformed. His previous coldness was replaced by feral violence. His exposed skin glowed a horrifying crimson, like a roasted crab.

Swish…

Ying Jiu seemed to move, or maybe not. The several opponents confronting him all took involuntary steps backward.

A splattering sound of blood broke out. Before one Divine Roaming Realm Seventh Stage master could even exchange a blow with Ying Jiu, his face went blank, and he plummeted from midair.

His throat gushed blood like a fountain. Before hitting the ground, his body exploded into a mist of blood, leaving no bones behind!

A chill rose from everyone’s hearts, making their bodies shiver.

“Do you think that’s enough?” Ying Jiu twirled the two daggers in his hands like butterflies dancing, elegant yet exuding a despairing aura of death. “If you think this is enough, then I will start killing!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the two Ninth Stage masters from the Xiang and Nan Families shouted angrily, “Be careful!”

They simultaneously stepped forward and unleashed their most treasured secret weapons and spell techniques, wild power surging out.

Ying Jiu’s figure darted through these forces like a lone boat tossed in a raging storm, unstable yet never sinking.

“All Divine Roaming Eighth Stage, come up!” Kang Zhan no longer dared to underestimate Ying Jiu. Now at the Ninth Stage wielding the Blood Fury Technique, Ying Jiu could spar with opponents beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

The few standing before him were insufficient to restrain him! Kang Zhan immediately ordered reinforcements.

One after another, four or five figures emerged from the crowd—all Divine Roaming Eighth Stage warriors, the total number the seven factions could muster.

Their arrival finally stalled Ying Jiu’s carefree stride for a moment, but he remained unstoppable.

Like an indestructible blade, wherever his daggers slashed, panic spread.

Ying Jiu, a master of stealth and assassination, held complete control in this one-against-many scenario. His elusive figure unsettled everyone’s hearts, holding them to the edge, refusing to lapse into carelessness.

“Still not enough!” Kang Zhan’s eyes flickered with despair. No sooner had he spoken than the only remaining Divine Roaming Seventh Stage master of the opposing forces screamed and fell.

“Elder!” someone shouted in distress.

This man belonged to one of the seven factions. Their strength wasn’t among the top, so losing a Seventh Stage master dealt a serious blow.

Looking up, the fallen master’s arms suddenly detached from his body, each severed arm clean, blood spraying vivid red.

“More people up!” Kang Zhan’s face was grim as he ordered again.

Several Divine Roaming Seventh Stage masters exchanged helpless glances and then reluctantly charged in.

With their help, Ying Jiu’s movements were finally checked, preventing him from executing the freedom of action he had earlier enjoyed.

With one man holding back two Ninth Stage, six Eighth Stage, and five Seventh Stage Divine Roaming masters, the strength of the Yang Family Blood Servants surpassed everyone’s expectations.

Even Ying Jiu himself was quite astonished.

Before his promotion, he often imagined how much stronger he would become. He had accurately appraised himself—though upon promotion and wielding the Blood Fury Technique he could hold off some experts, never did he expect this many or this level.

These numbers and tiers far exceeded Ying Jiu’s initial self-assessment.

He didn’t understand why, only knowing that he had indeed achieved this. Though it was tough, for now, his life was not in danger!

Could it be thanks to the Mystery Grade Pills from the alchemy room? Ying Jiu did not know. For now, all he could do was exert his full strength and lighten Yang Kai’s burden as much as possible.

Watching Ying Jiu struggling somewhat in the sky, Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru finally exhaled slowly.

They had never imagined such a situation and silently rejoiced that Second Young Master had foreseen this and brought so many reinforcements.

If they had stuck to the plan the two of them proposed back then, even Ying Jiu alone would likely have been beyond them—let alone capturing Yang Kai.

Second Young Master truly possessed foresight! At this moment, Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru could not help but feel a measure of respect for Yang Zhao.

“It’s our turn!” Kang Zhan took a deep breath and cast his gaze toward the ever-motionless Yang Kai.

Ying Jiu was now restrained. The rest was simply to capture Yang Kai. Though most of the strong fighters had been dispatched, Kang Zhan was still fully confident in apprehending Yang Kai.

After all, both he and Qiu Ziru had two Divine Roaming Fifth Stage experts from the Eight Great Families by their side, and other factions possessed many as well.

With such a lineup, Kang Zhan did not believe they could not subdue Yang Kai!
