## Chapter 551 — A Disguised War of Attrition

A mere War City, at this moment, had unexpectedly gathered eleven top-tier experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. The situation had completely spiraled out of the control of both sides.

At this point, no one could easily retreat; the stances were firmly established. Any withdrawal would be seen as cowardice and fear.

Ling Taixu quietly transmitted a warning to Yang Kai, advising him to be careful.

Yang Kai remained silent, instructing the warriors in his mansion to withdraw from the battle zone and gather together.

At the same time, Ye Xinrou was making similar arrangements.

Before long, the battlefield became starkly divided.

The eleven stood opposed in the sky, while below, the warriors from Yang Kai’s mansion and the joint forces of the Seven Great Families faced each other across a hundred zhang. Most of them were so tense that even their breathing ceased.

“Are they really going to fight?” Meng Wuya, looking at the eight figures opposite, saw this intention clearly in their eyes.

“The matter has come to this point. Well then, let us spar freely,” one among the eight, a fat elder, said coldly. He had been one of those who supported Yang Kai earlier and did not wish for such a conflict. Yet, fate had other plans, and he was helpless.

After all, he stood on the side of the Eight Great Families and would not do anything for Yang Kai, no matter how much he favored him.

“Very well.” Meng Wuya nodded gently, smiling as he looked ahead. “Group fight, single duel, war of attrition — how do you all wish to play? Draw your line, and the three of us will accept any challenge.”

Several among the eight coldly snorted with displeasure.

Meng Wuya’s words were too scornful of them, naturally arousing ill will.

The fat elder’s face darkened as he said, “You speak quite boldly.”

All were beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, people of status and position, usually beyond contest with mere mortals, and no one was qualified to confront them. Today’s battle was seemingly unavoidable. Should they gang up on a few, spreading such news would only invite scorn.

If group fighting was ruled out, only single duels or a war of attrition remained. None of the eight had confidence in single combat, so only one choice was left.

However, none among the eight were fools, so none directly answered Meng Wuya.

Suddenly, Yang Liting stepped forward and loudly declared, “Sect Leader Ling, we Yang family and your sect have a deep connection. Two generations of our disciples have trained under you. Thank you for your care. Today, I shall meet you to see just how skilled Sect Leader Ling truly is!”

Ling Taixu smiled faintly and replied calmly, “Very well. Since my ascension, I have never sparred with anyone of equal rank. Brother Yang, please go easy on me. Let us call it a draw after a few moves.”

“Please!” 

With that, Ling Taixu and Yang Liting shot into the night sky, vanishing in an instant. After a while, intense energy fluctuations erupted thousands of zhang above, with dazzling bursts of light illuminating the sky.

These were the exchanges between two beyond Divine Roaming experts—few were lucky enough to witness.

“Brother Yang is still impatient,” the fat elder muttered with a bitter smile before turning his sharp gaze to Meng Wuya. “Meng Brother, shall we ascend as well?”

With these words, he vanished wrapped in a pale blue radiance.

Meng Wuya followed suit.

“Demonic Master, I’ll meet you then!” another stepped forward, pointing at Di Mo.

Di Mo chuckled weirdly. “Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya have gone. I’m not going. If I leave, who will protect the Young Master?”

The man’s face darkened with anger. “What do you mean by that? Do you really think we would strike at a junior when the three of you aren’t around?”

“Aren’t you planning to?” Di Mo asked mockingly.

The man’s rage intensified as he shouted, “If you think that, you greatly underestimate us. We haven’t stooped to such disgraceful acts!”

Di Mo sneered coldly, “Who can say what you’re really thinking?”

He clearly wanted to stay and guard, fearing what he had mentioned earlier.

Refusing the challenge only made the man’s face go pale, and the other top experts showed gloomy expressions, glaring at Di Mo with True Yuan rippling around them.

“All right, I trust that you all are honorable people who would never plot against the Young Master in our absence,” Di Mo laughed loudly.

Though he believed these people were unlikely to act so unscrupulously, one must always remain vigilant.

But if he didn’t respond now, tensions would only worsen, so reluctantly he moved.

“Young Master, be careful. Do not let your guard down,” Di Mo murmured, transforming into a streak of blood-red light that shot into the sky. His distant voice then rang out, “Come up, I’m waiting for you!”

The man who spoke with Di Mo hurried to follow.

Six experts beyond Divine Roaming were now contending high above several thousand zhang. Everyone involuntarily craned their necks, concentrating on the battle, yet despite their keen eyesight, few details could be discerned.

Yang Kai, too, sensed some profound mysteries in the sky—each of those six deeply immersed in their paths of martial comprehension and Dao insights.

If one could absorb and digest such mysteries, it would be a tremendous aid to any warrior.

While observing silently and internalizing those enigmatic revelations, he stored them in his mind and body, waiting for the day he might fully decipher them.

The fight appeared to grow more intense, the light above shining like daylight, dazzling and piercing.

Within that radiant burst, fleeting human silhouettes darted about, but no one could discern their moves or techniques.

Many shrewd observers glanced at the expressions of the remaining members of the Eight Great Families and noticed their faces were tense and helpless.

Slowly, the realization dawned—the Eight Great Families were at a disadvantage in the battle above.

This revelation startled many.

The eight from Fengshen Hall had long been regarded as the epitome of strength, yet compared to the three from Yang Kai’s mansion, their inferiority was clear.

The realm beyond Divine Roaming was full of secrets; none truly knew what it entailed before arriving. Even Tu Feng and others had only superficial understanding.

Thus, learning that the Eight Great Families’ beyond Divine Roaming experts were struggling left the crowd stunned by the power shown by Ling Taixu and his companions.

Meng Wuya and Di Mo had only recently reached this stage by different methods, and Ling Taixu had achieved it barely over a year ago. Yet they were stronger than these veterans of the Eight Great Families.

Those eight had broken through beyond Divine Roaming at least fifty years ago. Could decades of hardship still not compare to a sudden breakthrough?

What sort of realm was beyond Divine Roaming indeed?

As the crowd sat in stunned confusion, a victor seemed clear in one of the battles above.

Moments later, two figures descended—Meng Wuya and his opponent.

Meng Wuya’s face remained calm and indifferent, while his adversary looked grim, reluctantly nodding and clasping his fist to Meng Wuya. “I’ve learned my lesson.”

“Well played,” Meng Wuya replied with a slight nod.

Neither showed wounds or battle marks, indicating either a peaceful spar or a vast disparity in strength.

The former seemed unlikely, given the tense words earlier, and the latter... no one wished to contemplate.

A while later, Ling Taixu and Yang Liting also descended, panting heavily while exchanging looks.

“Sect Leader Ling outshone me. I surrender,” Yang Liting said before calmly walking back.

The crowd erupted.

Meng Wuya won; Ling Taixu won. These elder figures from the Eight Great Families could not match the two from Yang Kai’s mansion.

One battle remained.

Just as people looked up, a heavy object crashed down from the sky with a thunderous boom, creating a deep pit in the ground.

Dust billowed, and when it cleared, the crowd gaped in shock.

The expert who had challenged Blood Demon stood there, his face pale. At his feet lay the crater he created by falling, and blood trickled from his mouth. He seemed injured.

Di Mo hovered dozens of zhang above, grimacing down at his opponent. “Sorry, I didn’t hold back—unlike Sect Leader Ling and Meng Wuya, who can control their strength perfectly.”

The man glanced at Di Mo silently before returning to his side and sitting cross-legged to cultivate. After a moment, he exhaled a sinister red-black breath.

This was the evil energy Di Mo forced into him.

All three battles ended in defeat!

The crowd was stunned, disbelief flashing in their eyes.

The beyond Divine Roaming experts from the Eight Great Families were so easily defeated? Yet these were figures standing atop the martial peak!

“Let’s see more. With your current attitude, you won’t be satisfied until you’re crushed. Today’s matter isn’t over yet,” Di Mo sneered.

Though sounding provocative, everyone knew the Eight Great Families’ top experts would fight to the bitter end if called upon.

Three down, five remain. Everyone understood this quietly.

Responding to Di Mo’s challenge, three more stepped forward.

Ling Taixu sighed, exchanging a helpless glance with Meng Wuya before ascending again.

The fierce battles beyond Divine Roaming flared anew. At this moment, the Seven Great Families’ coalition warriors clenched their fists, silently praying these three wouldn’t all suffer defeat as before.

All along, the eight from Fengshen Hall had been revered by many — if they all fell today, the prestige of the Eight Great Families would surely crumble.
