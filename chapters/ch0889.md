## Chapter 889 — Not Believing? Fine

Five people waited inside the hall when Yang Kai and Xu Hui arrived together.

The five hurriedly stood. The two experts of the Saint Realm kept scrutinizing Yang Kai, as if surprised that this newly famed Saint Lord was so young, and a trace of contempt flashed across their faces; but when they saw Xu Hui, their expressions grew considerably more grave.

Xu Hui’s cultivation was a level higher than theirs — a threshold they might never cross in their lifetimes — so they naturally treated him with due seriousness.

They quickly bowed.

Yang Kai greeted them warmly, and only after they sat down did he say, “You all came to refine pills, right?”

The group nodded in unison.

“Good. Hand over the medicinal ingredients you prepared and tell me the name of the pill you want refined. Wait a few hours and it’ll be done.”

Seeing his casual expression, the five stared at him in stunned silence; no one moved.

Yang Kai swept them with a look and chuckled, “What’s the matter? Didn’t you come to have pills refined? Didn’t even bring ingredients?”

“Of course we prepared ingredients… but may I ask, Saint Lord Yang, what is your sect’s pillmaster’s success rate for refining Saint Pills?” one of them frowned and asked.

“What if I guarantee one hundred percent success?” Yang Kai grinned.

The five took on odd expressions — clearly skeptical — even the middle‑aged woman who had personally seen a Spirit‑Grade Pill with Pill Patterns.

No pillmaster in the world can genuinely promise a one‑hundred‑percent success rate; even the most outstanding pillmasters sometimes fail.

That is the risk inherent to pill refinement.

Unless those words came from the elderly Tianzang, they carried no credibility.

This new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land… was a bit arrogant and reckless, they thought simultaneously; any prior hope they’d had shifted into anxious uncertainty.

“What’s the matter?” Xu Hui read their faces; seeing their hesitation, he frowned in displeasure and asked, “You don’t think my Sacred Land’s pillmaster can refine the Saint Pill you request?”

“We don’t dare say that!” the man’s face changed as he frowned. “It’s just that these Saint‑Grade ingredients I collected are hard to come by. If the refinement fails, gathering them again won’t be simple. So I was being cautious. Please forgive us, Saint Lord, and Elder.”

Yang Kai nodded faintly. “Caution is understandable. But wherever you go to refine Saint Pills you must accept the risk of failure — here is no different. However, I can promise that in my Sacred Land the risk is smallest, and there might even be unexpected gains.”

“Pill Patterns?” At his words, the five brightened simultaneously.

The middle‑aged woman stepped forward without hesitation. “If none of you want to try first, let me. I’m only having a single Upper‑Level Spirit‑Grade Pill refined. If it fails, recollecting materials won’t be hard, and there’s no great loss.”

Saying so, she produced the ingredients she’d brought.

The other four had no intention of rushing in; they all intended to first witness the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s pillmaster’s methods with their own eyes, and only then make their plans.

Knowing their thoughts, Yang Kai didn’t mind. He instructed Xu Hui to take the ingredients, then left.

The five continued waiting in the great hall.

Half an hour later Xu Hui reappeared in the hall, his expression proud.

The five rose immediately, gazing at him expectantly to learn the result.

Xu Hui casually tossed a jade vial over. “Have a look yourself. See what level our Sacred Land’s pillmaster is at.” he said indifferently.

The middle‑aged woman caught it, unable to contain her excitement. She opened the vial and poured out a dark‑blue pill.

In the next instant a shout broke out.

“Pill Patterns!”

“Pill Patterns!” echoed again.

That Upper‑Level Spirit‑Grade Pill truly bore Pill Patterns; its potency was concentrated and its value multiplied many times over.

The woman couldn’t hide her joy, clutching the spirit pill as her face bloomed into a smile.

The two Saint Realm experts exchanged a look and each saw horror in the other’s eyes.

If the rumors were true, then counting this pill, the hidden pillmaster at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had only produced four Spirit‑Grade Pills in total.

Each and every one was an Upper‑Level Spirit‑Grade Pill.

And among them three had manifested the rare and coveted Pill Patterns.

That amounted to nearly an eighty percent chance!

Ordinary pillmasters, even those renowned Saint‑Grade pillmasters across the continent, would strain for years before occasionally producing one such Spirit‑Grade Pill.

Yet at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Spirit‑Grade Pills with Pill Patterns seemed to appear as if they were free—sprouting one after another. How sensational!

“Hmph. Our Saint Lord says the master was in a good mood today, and had a good touch. If you want pills refined, hurry up. If the master’s mood sours in a few hours, he may stop,” Xu Hui said, lifting his chin arrogantly.

“Elder, these are the ingredients I brought!” On hearing this, the four wasted no more hesitation and rushed forward, eager to hand over their prepared ingredients lest the mysterious master’s mood turn sour and his touch grow poor.

If that master could produce a Spirit‑Grade Upper‑Level Pill with Pill Patterns, then refining a Saint Pill would be a mere formality for him.

Xu Hui didn’t make things difficult; he accepted them readily, and even took the reward the middle‑aged woman had offered before leaving calmly.

He couldn’t run a losing business forever; it was time to collect some payment.

The woman was honest and upright; the reward she prepared was indeed worth the pill she had asked refined.

Half an hour later Xu Hui returned again, bringing back two Spirit‑Grade Pills, which he handed to the two who had requested them.

Though these two pills lacked Pill Patterns, their quality was astonishingly high; despite some regret, the pair were satisfied, left their payment, and departed.

Only the two Saint Realm experts remained in the hall, anxious and fidgety, occasionally standing to look around in hopes that Xu Hui would appear with the refined Saint Pills.

They knew, however, that refining Saint Pills was essentially different from refining Spirit‑Grade Pills — the time and effort required scaled up geometrically, so impatience was useless.

They resigned themselves to waiting.

After more than an hour, the Saint Lord Yang Kai summoned Xu Hui, who had been waiting outside.

Entering Yang Kai’s side room, Xu Hui immediately smelled the full fragrance of pills filling the room; his expression changed as he searched around.

He wanted to know who had been helping those people refine pills, and who possessed such miraculous skill.

Unfortunately, after looking around he found nothing.

“The pills are ready. Take them over now, but don’t hand them over yet. Deliver them tomorrow morning.”

Xu Hui pondered, nodded slightly, and as he accepted the two Saint Pills asked, “Saint Lord, do you mean to let them know that refining Saint Pills is not easy?”

Yang Kai glanced at him and said coldly, “I simply want them to learn that if they doubt the caliber of my Sacred Land’s pillmaster, they’ll receive a little punishment.”

Xu Hui could only laugh and shake his head; he said no more, though his eyes kept darting about.

Seeing him reluctant to leave and still peering around, Yang Kai asked, “Are you looking for that pillmaster?”

Xu Hui chuckled and lowered his voice, “Saint Lord, when did our Sacred Land get such a master? Even this old man didn’t know. He worked so hard to help our Sacred Land through this difficulty; I should at least go thank him. After all, I am a senior elder of the Sacred Land.”

“You want to know who he is?” Yang Kai smiled at him.

Xu Hui straightened and nodded earnestly.

“What if I told you that I was the one who refined the pills?”

“Saint Lord, don’t joke…” Xu Hui looked incredulous. “You are young yet already possess Third Stage Transcendent Realm cultivation — a dragon among men who will rival past Saint Lords. I believe that completely. But that you’re also an expert pillmaster… hehe, I can’t accept that. To produce Saint Pills a master normally spends a hundred years at least in the craft. You are far too young; even if you’d been refining since the womb it wouldn’t be possible.”

"Don't believe it? Fine!" Yang Kai snorted, pursing his lips and offering no further explanation.

“Uh…” Xu Hui was stunned and grew all the more curious about the hidden pillmaster, but with Yang Kai refusing to say, he had no way to learn more and could only leave dejectedly.

The next morning Xu Hui floated back to the great hall.

The two First Stage Saint Realm experts had stayed up all night, their eyes bloodshot. Seeing Xu Hui appear, they rushed forward and asked urgently, “Elder… what’s the situation?”

Their expressions were tense; they feared Xu Hui might bring bad news.

At their level of strength they usually enjoyed high status and comfortable means, and didn’t worry about Crystal Stones.

But as one of them had said earlier, those painstakingly gathered Saint‑Grade materials were hard to find; some couldn’t be bought with money and had been sought by traversing Great Wilderness and wild ridges.

Luck played a large part in obtaining them.

If refinement failed, the Sacred Land might compensate, but not with the rare ingredients — only with Crystal Stones.

They’d have to go search or purchase them again.

Seeing the two acting like that, Xu Hui felt a strange surge of satisfaction and said arrogantly, “When our Sacred Land’s master gets to work, how could he fail? I don’t know what you were worried about.”

“So then…”

“Here, take them!” Xu Hui handed them two jade vials, flicked nonexistent dust off his robes, and snorted, “Next time you need Saint Pills refined, just come to our Sacred Land — you’ll be satisfied!”

The two inspected the pills in the vials and their faces suddenly filled with joy. One of them exclaimed repeatedly, “Your sect’s master’s skill is truly remarkable; I’ll definitely come again. By the way, I have many friends who can’t find competent masters to refine their pills—could your master help them as well?”

The other hastened to say he too had many relatives and friends in the same predicament.
