## Chapter 2076 — The City Besieged by Demonic Qi

Over Fenglin City, amid a thunderous roar and the trembling of the earth, a multicolored luminous curtain suddenly rose up, forming a semicircular arc that shrouded the entire city.

These defensive formation arrays had been painstakingly forged and arrayed over generations by Fenglin City's successive City Lords and the mighty experts of its clans to guard against outside foes — yet, in practice, the formation had essentially never been put to use.

Because until now Fenglin City had never encountered a true invading force, even the cultivators who had lived there for many years had nearly forgotten the existence of those defensive arrays.

But at that very moment, the formations were being activated one by one.

"What’s happening? How could these formations be opened?" people cried.

"Something serious must have occurred—could an enemy be invading?"

"Could an Emperor Realm expert have come?"

For a time, the city’s cultivators were filled with doubt and began to argue among themselves, and some craned their necks toward the City Lord’s mansion to see what explanation the lord might offer.

Just then, a hurried shout came from beyond the city walls: ‘Everyone, hurry inside the city at once—do not delay!’

The voice shouted several times in rapid succession, sounding urgent and authoritative, and it practically spread through all of Fenglin City.

"That’s the voice of the Deputy City Lord, Drunken Old Man!"

Some cultivators who recognized the voice stiffened and immediately leapt up to the ramparts; in no time the walls were crowded with people looking out.

In the next moment, cries of alarm rose up one after another.

"Look—the Deputy City Lord seems to be chased by something!"

"My heavens, what on earth is that? It’s a pitch-black mass!"

"Even the Deputy City Lord is no match for it?"

While the crowd debated, the Drunken Old Man had already rushed to the front of Fenglin City, and the cultivator responsible for controlling the formation’s barrier immediately opened a gap before him. The Drunken Old Man’s figure flickered and he shot through the opening into the city.

After he entered, the split in the barrier rapidly sealed up and returned to its original state.

At the same time, the pitch-black aura that had been pursuing the Drunken Old Man also arrived, still moving rapidly, and it slammed into the outermost light screen.

Boom...

A tremendous boom resounded. The luminous screen trembled and its brightness suddenly dimmed considerably, almost collapsing. The nearby cultivators who witnessed it were startled and stepped back, their faces draining of color.

The cultivators controlling the arrays hurriedly poured in more power and managed with great difficulty to stabilize the trembling screen.

Swish, swish, swish...

Streams of light cut through the air from all directions inside the city—clearly the experts of Fenglin City who had sensed the disturbance.

The City Lord, Duan Yuanshan, was the first to appear; he landed on the ramparts and stared ahead with a grave expression, his eyelids twitching slightly.

On either side of him, several experts exuding Dao Origin Realm energy also appeared, and when they saw the terrifying sight ahead, their faces changed dramatically.

"Lord Duan, what on earth are those things?" asked one white‑haired elder.

That elder was Qin Chaoyang, the patriarch of the Qin Family, a First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator—one of the oldest of the nearly ten Dao Origin Realm figures present, his face already showing age spots.

Such physical signs were extremely rare in Dao Origin Realm cultivators; they only appeared when a cultivator’s life neared its end.

"Indeed, Lord Duan, since you ordered the defensive arrays activated early, you must have received some news?" Du Lishen, the Du Family patriarch, asked.

The other Dao Origin Realm figures from the clans also looked to Duan Yuanshan, hoping he would provide an explanation.

"Demonic Qi! Pure Demonic Qi from an Ancient Great Demon!" Duan Yuanshan said heavily. "It’s said to have leaked from two thousand li away!"

"Pure Demonic Qi from an Ancient Great Demon?" The Dao Origin Realm experts all went pale at his words.

"I only just received the news myself, so don’t ask me where this Demonic Qi came from—I don’t know. I only know that if we cannot unite, Fenglin City will be in peril today!"

At those words, the Dao Origin Realm figures’ expressions all turned solemn.

Duan Yuanshan turned to those around him: "You are all leaders of your families, and many of your kin remain in the city; you do not want to see them consumed by Demonic Qi and driven mad, do you?"

"Of course not!" Qin Chaoyang was the first to reply. "But how should we resist this enemy? Please, City Lord, instruct us!"

"Indeed—this is the first time we’ve met pure Demonic Qi from an Ancient Great Demon; we do not know the most effective means to dispel it," Liang Pengle of the Liang family said sternly.

Duan Yuanshan was momentarily at a loss for words. Although he was a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm and thus slightly stronger than the others present, he, like them, had never encountered the pure Demonic Qi of an Ancient Great Demon before and did not know how best to purge it.

"Brother Duan, for now we should consolidate the defenses and deal with research later," the Drunken Old Man said; his drunkenness had long since vanished, and he was clearer-headed than ever.

"Precisely." Duan Yuanshan’s eyes brightened. "Everyone should each take a section of the wall to assist in stabilizing the defensive formations. I will find someone to question for more information!"

As he spoke, Duan Yuanshan gave the Drunken Old Man a look; understanding, the Drunken Old Man called the others over and they began studying the arrays.

In a short time, the Dao Origin Realm cultivators had determined their respective defense sectors and dispersed.

The Drunken Old Man’s expression shifted as if he had remembered something, and he hastened toward the City Lord’s mansion.

The alarm outside the city had already spread within; word of mouth quickly carried it from ten to a hundred. Fenglin City’s cultivators soon learned of the situation, and many hot‑blooded warriors answered the call and went to the walls to help defend.

In no time the ramparts of Fenglin City were filled to overflowing.

At the same time, in front of the Spiritual Pill shop, Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi returned. With a sweep of his Divine Sense, Yang Kai learned that Kang Siran and the others at the shop were already prepared and had even boarded the tower ship.

He signaled to Mo Xiaoqi, who immediately flashed into the tower ship.

Just as he prepared to board, he glanced to the side, lost in thought.

There, among the onlookers, a plain-looking middle-aged man was quietly watching him; when their eyes met, the man’s mouth curled in a strange smile.

Yang Kai frowned.

The man felt utterly unfamiliar to him, and he was certain he had never met him before—yet the man was a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, which surprised him.

Cultivators of that level rarely appeared in Fenglin City. Apart from the last time when Luan Feng had appeared on Yuqing Mountain and attracted many powerful beings to investigate, Fenglin City might not see a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert pass through even once a year.

Yet now there was one in the crowd, and he seemed interested in Yang Kai, which puzzled Yang Kai.

He didn’t dwell on it and quickly boarded the tower ship, directing it to rush outward.

After the tower ship departed, the middle-aged man chuckled coldly and muttered in a voice too low for others to hear, "After searching in vain for so long, it came to me without effort. I didn’t expect to find the Young Sect Master’s tower ship here today—so you should know something, shouldn’t you?"

That middle-aged man was the expert whom Fei Sheng Palace’s lord had sent months ago to investigate and avenge the murder of Ning Yuancheng.

Following the trail, he had easily learned that Ning Yuancheng’s last appearance was at Fenglin City’s auction and naturally made his way to the city.

But after half a year he had gathered no useful information.

He had not expected that by chance he would see Ning Yuancheng’s tower ship in the city today.

He did not believe Yang Kai had the ability to kill Ning Yuancheng—after all, Liu Yizhi, a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, had been protecting Ning Yuancheng at the time, so Yang Kai’s cultivation should not have been enough—yet he thought that since Yang Kai had obtained Ning Yuancheng’s tower ship, Yang Kai must know something.

That was why he took an interest in Yang Kai.

There were too many people in the city to make a move conveniently, so he intended to tail the tower ship and act later.

At the city walls, Yang Kai guided the tower ship into position, but the moment he looked outside his heart sank.

The boundless ancient Demonic Qi had already encircled Fenglin City with no gaps; from above the city looked as if a sturdy black wall had formed around it.

That black wall writhed and flowed, stretching for dozens of li, and any living being who rushed into it would likely meet a grim fate.

Although a tower ship was not low-grade and carried some defensive formations, to charge in so rashly would doom everyone but himself, Yang Kai estimated.

"Brother Yang..." Kang Siran had obviously seen the same thing and looked pale. "What are we to do?"

"Ah, it's already too late!" Mo Xiaoqi bit her lip, frustrated, and cursed Zhuang Pan angrily in her heart.

If they had not wasted so much time with Zhuang Pan then, perhaps they could have left before the city was surrounded by Demonic Qi; but now it was too late.

Inside the tower ship, many pairs of eyes turned toward Yang Kai.

At this moment Yang Kai was the most powerful among them and had naturally become their pillar of support.

Yang Kai’s face was stern but not overly panicked.

Even if they were driven into a corner, he could send everyone into the Small Xuan Realm and then brave the Demonic Qi blockade alone.

Yang Kai judged he had an eighty percent chance of escaping safely by using Spatial Force.

But if he did that, the colossal secret of the Xuan Realm Pearl would be exposed; the Zhang family might swear to keep silent because they saw Yang Kai as a benefactor, but the secret could not remain hidden.
