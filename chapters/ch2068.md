## Chapter 2068 — Completely a Misunderstanding

"Pillmaster Yang!" Jiang Lin suddenly rose, his gaze cold and predatory as it fixed on Yang Kai, his tone openly hostile. "I hadn't thought you had such skill to be able to find your way here. I, Jiang, underestimated you."

Yang Kai gave a cold snort. “If you feared being exposed, you shouldn’t have acted in the first place.”

A cold light flashed in Jiang Lin’s eyes, his anger plain as he cut a glance toward Jiang Taisheng and found the latter utterly impassive. He drew a deep breath and barked, “Pillmaster Yang, I, Jiang, admit you have talent and have no wish to hound you to death. If you are willing to sign this Soul Contract before my Jiang Family, we may yet spare your life!”

As he spoke, he suddenly produced a piece of ancient beast-skin paper.

Yang Kai looked closely and found that the thing was strikingly similar to the one Kang Siran had produced before — not only in shape and size, but even the aura it gave off was nearly identical.

Yang Kai immediately understood: this was a genuine Soul Contract, an item from Soul Palace.

The Soul Contract had been researched by Great Emperor Youhun, one of the Ten Emperors, and only those of Soul Palace knew how to craft them. Once a martial artist burned their Soul Brand or life mark onto a Soul Contract, that contract would exert wondrous power, binding the martial artist to fulfill its terms; if they violated it, they would suffer Soul-Devouring pain and have their soul utterly destroyed.

Back then, Kang Siran had been forced to use a Soul Contract to prevent Yang Kai from revealing the Origin Condensing Pill's formula, and it had cost him many days of grief — after all, such things were supremely precious and each was worth a small fortune.

No one knew where the Jiang Family had obtained one, yet now they had produced it.

"Soul Contract?" Yang Kai wore a half-smirk. "Jiang Family's head makes a grand gesture — such an item is extremely precious; isn't using it on me a waste?"

Jiang Lin said expressionlessly, "For Pillmaster Yang, one Soul Contract is nothing."

Yang Kai regarded him with leisurely composure. "But I do want to know — what exactly is written on this Soul Contract?"

Jiang Lin smiled faintly, "Isn't it obvious, Pillmaster Yang? It's merely a hope that you will become one of our Jiang Family and refine Spiritual Pills for us."

"I cannot agree to such a thing!" Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Jiang Lin's expression darkened as he shouted, "Yang Kai. Don't refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit — today you will sign this Soul Contract whether you like it or not; you have no say!"

A Void King-Grade pillmaster was an absolute treasure for a family like the Jiang Family; if they hadn't intended to capture Yang Kai alive, why would they have brought Jiang Taisheng, an expert of the Dao Origin Realm, into this? And today nearly every expert in the clan had been mobilized to force Yang Kai to burn his Soul Brand onto the contract.

If Yang Kai yielded, the Jiang Family would not only gain a Void King-Grade pillmaster, they would no longer fear him revealing the secrets of the mine.

Hearing Jiang Lin's brazen words, Yang Kai couldn't help but laugh aloud. "What a joke. My limbs belong to me — I'll do as I please. What can your Jiang Family do to me?"

Jiang Lin flew into a rage.

Just as he was about to speak, Jiang Taisheng, who had been silent until now, suddenly opened his eyes, glanced coolly at Yang Kai, and raised a hand to stop Jiang Lin from speaking.

He said lightly, “Young man, you think that with a bit of skill you already know how high the heavens are and how deep the earth is. That this old man personally came here today is already granting you immeasurable face. I hear you are a Void King-Grade Pill Refining Master, and that the Origin Condensing Pills you refine are of fine quality. This old man cherishes talent and has no wish to strike you down. If you obediently imprint your Soul Brand upon this Soul Contract, this old man will act as though nothing happened today. As for the little girl in your arms and the companion at your side, this old man can spare their lives as well… but the condition is that both must be married into my Jiang Family as concubines.”

"What? You want me to enter your Jiang Family as a concubine?"

Yang Kai had not yet spoken when Mo Xiaoqi, who had stood by impassively as if watching a show, suddenly sprang up. With a face of shame and fury she glared at Jiang Taisheng and snapped, "You old wretch, you have no respect for your age — how can you say such shameless words!"

"How dare you!"

"Audacious!"

A group of Jiang Family cultivators shouted at Mo Xiaoqi in anger, their expressions furious as if she had said something utterly improper.

Yang Kai chuckled, holding Zhang Ruoxi in one arm, theatrically fiddled at his ear with the other, tilted his head and asked Mo Xiaoqi, "Xiao Qi, why do I hear a mad dog barking?"

"Mmm..." Mo Xiaoqi glanced at him and, with a straight face, nodded solemnly, "Yes, and it's barking terribly."

Jiang Taisheng's eyes narrowed; a cold light flashed as he said in a deep voice, "Very well, the two juniors are indeed bold — I haven't heard anyone speak to me like this in many years. There's a path to heaven you won't take..."

"Cut the act — what are you putting on, playing god?" Yang Kai interrupted impatiently, "You think you're something just because you're at the Dao Origin Realm?"

With those words, Yang Kai's figure blurred.

Before the Jiang Family could react, Yang Kai had already appeared eerily not far in front of Jiang Lin.

"Ah?" Jiang Lin was startled and involuntarily stumbled back, but before he could do anything else Yang Kai reached out a hand toward him.

Jiang Lin, terrified, didn't think — he summoned Origin Qi, clenched both fists and struck forward.

Energy churned in the void with a tiger's roar, and a huge tiger phantom flashed forth, opening its blood-red maw to bite.

But the strike hit empty air — Yang Kai had vanished at some unknown moment.

When Jiang Lin looked around in alarm, he discovered Yang Kai had already returned to his original spot, as though he had never moved at all.

For a moment, cold sweat dotted Jiang Lin's forehead; the Jiang Family onlookers were ashen.

"Xiaoqi, see if this is real." Yang Kai casually handed an object from his hand to Mo Xiaoqi; she took it and examined it carefully.

"Ah? My Soul Contract!" Jiang Lin suddenly realized the Soul Contract he had been holding had somehow been snatched by Yang Kai; he stared at his empty hands in shock, then looked up toward the spot not far ahead and his heart sank into the depths...

"Dao Origin Realm!" Jiang Taisheng's eyes narrowed as he murmured.

Previously Yang Kai had not used any force, so Jiang Taisheng had not examined his strength carefully and had assumed Yang Kai's cultivation was at the Void King Realm level; but now, from Yang Kai's move, Jiang Taisheng discerned the truth.

Upon realizing this, Jiang Taisheng's expression grew ugly.

After all, he himself was only First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm; if Yang Kai's cultivation matched his, he would gain no advantage.

This was completely unlike what he had imagined — he had thought that by personally coming out to handle two juniors it would be an easy matter, and he had never once looked the two of them squarely in the eye.

Only now did he know he had been mistaken, terribly mistaken!

As a fellow First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator, Yang Kai already had the standing to speak to him on equal terms.

And judging from the speed of his earlier move, had he wanted to kill others in the Jiang Family, he likely would have done so already...

"That's right, Eldest Brother — this is indeed a Soul Palace Soul Contract. It's a valuable item; you should keep it, it might come in handy later." After checking it over, Mo Xiaoqi returned the Soul Contract to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it back and, indifferent, slipped it into his Spatial Ring.

"I was discourteous; it turns out you are also a Dao Origin Realm cultivator — no wonder you had such confidence!" Jiang Taisheng's demeanor was no longer light and facile, but carried a trace of gravity, his mouth twitching slightly.

Yang Kai sneered, "Your face changes quickly."

"Truly the height of shamelessness!" Mo Xiaoqi spat in contempt from the side.

Jiang Taisheng's contradictory behavior left Mo Xiaoqi with even more contempt.

Jiang Taisheng snorted coldly, "Even if you are Dao Origin Realm, today you still owe me an explanation — otherwise don't expect to leave easily."

"An explanation?" Yang Kai's face turned cold and severe: "Which of us should be giving explanations? My friend was seized by your people without cause and dragged here to mine, suffering torment. When I came to your Jiang Family to inquire, you concealed the truth—fine. But you even wished to kill and silence her. Had I not arrived in time, would my friend still be alive? And you still dare want an explanation?”

Jiang Taisheng was left speechless; he hadn't expected Yang Kai's words to be so sharp and at a loss for a response.

"Pillmaster Yang!" As head of the Jiang Family, Jiang Lin could only step forward and, cupping his fist, say, "Pillmaster Yang, calm your anger — this matter... this matter is completely a misunderstanding!"

Having just had a near-death experience at Yang Kai's hands, he no longer dared to look down on Yang Kai; his tone softened into a strained smile as he said bitterly, "This truly is a misunderstanding!"

"A misunderstanding?" Yang Kai coldly regarded him, the corner of his mouth lifting with no genuine warmth, his face growing icily severe, "You captured my people, and now you call it a misunderstanding? Tell me, Family Head Jiang—are you mocking me, or mocking yourself?”

Jiang Lin's face filled with worry as he said, "Pillmaster Yang, we did not know that young miss was yours. Had we known, we would have treated her as an honored guest rather than bringing her to the mine. Now she is safe — let today's matter end here, shall we? That Soul Contract can serve as the Jiang Family's apology... and in a few days we will deliver further generous gifts to your residence."
