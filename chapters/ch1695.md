## Chapter 1695 — Lord of the Dark Star

Yang Kai opened his eyes, and a wondrous sensation arose from within his chest.

The entire Dark Star seemed to become part of his body; he could, at will, sense any patch of land upon it, detect where this Cultivation Star was rich or barren, and perceive the births, ageing, sickness and deaths of the lives dwelling on it!

If he wished, he could easily reach any place on the Dark Star with no restraint; if he wished, he could, in a single thought, make heaven collapse and earth split, mountains fall and seas surge...

He gently clenched his fist and the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth trembled; from the void came a sound like a great bell.

At that moment countless beings on the Dark Star were struck with terror, looking up in bewilderment, unaware of what had occurred.

At the instant Yang Kai became the Star Lord of the Dark Star, the star itself underwent a most subtle change—indescribable, sensed only by a very few experts; the vast majority perceived nothing at all.

From now on the Dark Star would be closely tied to Yang Kai; as his cultivation rose, the vitality of the whole Dark Star would shine ever more brilliantly.

Yang Kai looked inward and found within his Dantian a tiny orb, appearing like the Dark Star reduced by countless times, seated there and rotating at a delicate pace.

The power of the Stellar Origin!

To become the Star Lord of a Cultivation Star one must refine that Star’s Origin, and the thing Yang Yan had previously inserted into his body was undoubtedly the Stellar Origin of the Dark Star.

That vastly shrunken Dark Star, with each rotation, fed back some wondrous and subtle force, nourishing Yang Kai’s body while also drawing on his strength to grow itself.

It was a mutually beneficial process.

Excitement and joy filled Yang Kai, yet a trace of doubt lingered on his face.

Is this how one becomes the Star Lord of the Dark Star? Is this how one becomes the master of a land?

He could not help feeling it was unreal; Little Senior Sister had become the Star Lord of the Tongxuan Continent by luck—the Spiritual Qi there was barren, like a dying old man—so the Stellar Origin sought out Xia Ningshang to be refined.

But the Dark Star was different; even if heavenly laws suppressed comprehension of the Void King Realm, this was a vigorous Cultivation Star. If the Tongxuan Continent was a withered elder, the Dark Star was a robust young adult full of vigor.

To refine the Origin of such a Cultivation Star was impossible without Void King Realm cultivation, and one must be at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm!

Someone like Luo Hai, who became a Star Lord at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, was unique across the entire Star Domain.

As if sensing Yang Kai’s doubt, Yang Yan’s voice echoed within his Sea of Consciousness: “The Stellar Origin of Dark Star has been bound by me for tens of thousands of years. Now that it finally has a chance to break free from my control, do you think it’ll obediently cooperate?”

Yang Kai was stunned.

Yang Yan chuckled: "Rest assured, its temper has long since been ground down. It was not so docile in the past, which is why I imprisoned it back then."

Yang Kai forced a wry smile and finally understood the reason; anyone confined for tens of thousands of years would likely lose their temper. Although the Stellar Origin had no independent mind, it knew it could not resist Yang Yan’s methods and could only submit.

The seat of Star Lord had come so easily that Yang Kai found it hard to adapt.

With a thought he expanded his Divine Sense; it flowed like a tide and spread like a spider’s web in all directions, and after a short while had covered more than half of the Dark Star.

Yang Kai detected many battles as if he were seeing them with his own eyes.

Yet the soul force within his Sea of Consciousness was draining at a terrifying speed.

When he retracted his Divine Sense he discovered that in the brief span of five breaths his Sea of Consciousness had been reduced by one third.

That meant he could only monitor the Dark Star for fifteen breaths before his Sea of Consciousness would be utterly exhausted, and even then he could not sustain full surveillance! Calculating it, Yang Kai could only shake his head: though his cultivation was only the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, his soul force could rival the Void King Realm, and with a treasure like the Warm Spirit Lotus his Sea of Consciousness should not normally run dry.

It seemed that even as a Star Lord, without commensurate strength beneath him, he still could not act entirely at will.

But for now, this was sufficient.

"I’ll go handle a few small troubles and return to see you later," Yang Kai said, and without waiting for Yang Yan’s reply his figure flickered and he was gone.

More than one hundred thousand li from Lingxiao Sect, a group of Corpse Spirit Sect disciples were launching a fierce counterattack while a band of human warriors struggled to resist.

Since Lingxiao Sect and Yingyue Hall issued a joint summons, the whole Dark Star had erupted into a wave of resistance against the Corpse Spirit Sect.

Under the leadership of Ye Xijun and Qian Tong, the Corpse Spirit Sect’s army was steadily beaten back; the Corpse Spirit Race suffered countless casualties, and warriors who had lost homes and sect foundations spontaneously gathered to strike at the Corpse Spirit Sect that had seized their lands.

Without the Corpse Den to convert new members, each death among the Corpse Spirit Race meant one fewer body with no fresh blood to refill their ranks; coupled with rumors that their Sect Leader was dead and senior members slaughtered, the Corpse Spirit Sect had little capacity left to resist.

Human warriors advanced like a blade through bamboo, allies blooming across the field, slaughtering the Corpse Spirit Sect’s forces until they fled in disarray.

More than eighty percent of the sects had already recaptured lost ground! They moved steadily—keeping enough hands at their main halls to guard against counterattacks while dispatching their experts to support the fronts.

They were truly terrified of the Corpse Spirit Sect; they knew that unless it was eradicated now, this bizarre race would sooner or later rise again.

Most families and sects threw their strength into the effort, determined to fight the Corpse Spirit Sect to the bitter end!

Right now, a scene all too common on Dark Star was unfolding here — a remnant group of Corpse Spirits had been hiding in this place, but once they were accidentally discovered, thousands of human cultivators rushed over and completely surrounded them.

Though fewer than a thousand in number, the trapped Corpse Spirit Race fought like cornered beasts and were exceedingly troublesome; after all, they were transformed from the dead, hardly feeling pain, with bodies as hard as iron, and were difficult to slay unless one destroyed their Corpse Pearls; at equal rank human warriors were no match.

Several thousand people had trapped the Corpse Spirit Race in a small valley but dared not launch a reckless assault; they elected to clear the outskirts selectively and gradually weaken them.

The Corpse Spirit Race clearly perceived the enemy’s plan and refused to lie down to die; they organized several desperate breakouts, suffering heavy casualties but also taking many human lives with them.

For a time the two sides reached a stalemate: the Corpse Spirit Race was trapped and ferocious, while the human warriors hesitated and held back.

Just as the human experts did not know what to do, a youth suddenly and strangely appeared in midair.

He arrived so abruptly that there was no warning; by the time people noticed he was already standing there.

The youth glanced down into the valley, then lifted a palm and lightly slapped down.

The motion was casual, as if swatting a fly.

But at that slap Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth converged crazily beneath his palm, forming a gigantic imprint large enough to cover the entire valley.

The palm-shaped imprint filled sky and earth and struck with lightning speed.

Boom...

The ground shook violently, nearly knocking the several thousand human warriors off their feet.

In the next instant everyone’s faces drained of color.

They watched in horror as under that Spiritual Qi palm the nearly one thousand Corpse Spirit Race—regardless of cultivation or strength—were all smashed into a bloody pulp.

Ninety-nine percent died instantly; only a few lucky ones escaped being struck down, standing pale and trembling, staring up in terror.

In that moment the youth’s figure was like a divine pillar, dominating the heavens and earth.

After a single palm he merely shifted slightly and vanished, as if he had never appeared.

But the giant palm print in the valley and the dead strewn about proved the event had truly occurred.

"Who is that? How can he be so formidable?"

"The might of that palm may well equal Hall Master Qian of Yingyue Hall. I heard Qian is a Void King Realm expert—could our Dark Star have a second Void King Realm?"

"No—five months ago I had the fortune to witness Hall Master Qian’s earth-shattering methods, but this palm seems even slightly beyond that!"

"How is that possible? Could he be stronger than Hall Master Qian? I don’t believe it."

"Ha! I know who he is—that’s Yang Kai, Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect! I met him once before when he was at Dragon Lair Mountain."

"He is the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect?"

Everyone’s faces lit with sudden understanding, convinced the rumors were true; that Lingxiao Sect could rise to be among the strongest on the Dark Star was not without reason—such a mighty Sect Master ensured the sect’s prosperity.

“Enough chatter — there are still a few stragglers left to deal with. Sect Master Yang already took care of the biggest trouble for us; we can’t very well trouble him to come back and give another slap, can we?”

The gathered experts all nodded repeatedly and stepped forward, each casting malicious looks toward the few surviving Corpse Spirits, closing in on them step by step.

They might as well have been killed by the palm!

Seeing enemies closing in from every side, those few Corpse Spirit Race thought just that.

Yang Kai, enjoying the conveniences of being a Star Lord, felt his heart blossom with delight.

No wonder those Void King Realm experts covet refining a Stellar Origin and becoming Star Lords—this is immensely convenient. Once one became the Star Lord of a Cultivation Star, wherever the heart wished and the body moved one could instantly reach any place on that star; it was far more convenient and swifter than using a Space Array.
