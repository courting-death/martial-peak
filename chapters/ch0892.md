## Chapter 892 — Finding Joy in It

The Divine Tree's movements sent the Moonlight Herb into a greater panic; after darting about and hiding, it plunged headlong into the Wan Yao Ling Ye.

In an instant the Moonlight Herb calmed. Clearly visible, it had absorbed some of the Wan Yao Ling Ye, and a moonlike radiance flowed over its three leaves.

Yang Kai's face darkened. Just as he was about to pull the Moonlight Herb out of the Wan Yao Ling Ye, the Divine Tree had already acted first.

An invisible force wrapped the three-leaf Spiritual Herb and tugged it free.

Immediately Yang Kai felt as if the Divine Tree's Divine Sense was communicating with the Moonlight Herb.

He smiled slightly and paused his movement.

After a while the Divine Tree transmitted, "I've scolded it and will keep watch so it won't wander in there again, but this little thing's intellect is like mine in ages past—not complete—so communication is somewhat difficult. This is the Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Object you mentioned earlier?"

"Mm." Yang Kai chuckled. "Take your time; one day you'll be able to communicate smoothly. I'll find some other Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects for you when I can, so you won't be lonely."

"Good!" the Divine Tree replied.

Yang Kai sent Xu Hui to ask the pill-seekers about Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects; he had suddenly recalled the promise he made to the Divine Tree. Many who came seeking pills were from all corners; someone would eventually be lucky enough to possess such an object.

He hadn't expected instant success, yet fortune smiled—among those people someone truly owned one and was willing to produce it.

After watching for a while to be certain there were no problems, Yang Kai's spirit left the Black Book Space and he resumed his grand work of refining pills.

For over a month he remained here refining pills, not stepping outside even once.

Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pills and Saint-Grade Lower-Level pills were produced by his hand in countless numbers, without a single failure.

Because he bore the Divine Sense Fire, he also mastered many exquisite spirit formations. His pillcraft speed far outpaced ordinary alchemists.

At his current level, forging a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill took less than the burn of an incense stick; a Saint-Grade Lower-Level pill required only half an hour.

Each day he refined exactly ten pills.

The remaining time he used to recover and to contemplate the gains from the refining process.

He took delight in it!

He felt not the slightest irritation or despair.

With a large supply of high-grade medicinal ingredients to practice on, his earlier theories about Pill Patterns were being confirmed in practice.

Pill Patterns can indeed be artificially produced, but it is mentally and physically taxing. At the moment before the pill forms one must merge countless spirit formations together and refine them into the Pill.

Once successful, a Pill Pattern forms, and the Pill will endure without decay.

He could now produce Pill Patterns at will on Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pills. Saint-Grade pills still depended on luck; sometimes his technique wasn't precise enough and a Pill Pattern failed to form.

During refining the Divine Sense Fire was invoked frequently; after more than a month Yang Kai not only did not feel exhausted, he vaguely felt his Divine Sense Fire grow purer and more concentrated.

The insights from alchemy turned into cultivation experience, settling and fermenting, solidifying and strengthening his foundation. His power advanced by great strides.

Alchemy and martial cultivation complemented one another. Together they progressed in step, and the results were gratifying.

Without deliberately training, his realm steadily increased; at this pace, within three to five years Yang Kai felt he could reach the threshold of the Saint Realm.

With other opportunities, that time could be further shortened.

Having reached the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, he was only one step away from entering the Saint Realm.

Unlike the rise from the True Yuan Realm to the Divine Roaming Realm, or from the Divine Roaming Realm to the Transcendent Realm, taking that final step into the Saint Realm was more difficult than any prior advancement.

The elixir of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower could assist Transcendent Realm fighters in breaking through; Yang Kai still had two drops left from the last condensation in the starry sky.

At that time six drops were condensed in total; he gave four to Cang Yan and the others, keeping the remainder in the Black Book Space.

The Thousand-Year Demon Flower's elixir carried no side effects; Cang Yan, Fei Yu and several senior elders used it to breakthrough to the First Stage of the Saint Realm, their foundations unaffected, and it did not hinder subsequent cultivation and advancement.

But Yang Kai did not intend to rely on external aids for now; he decided to attempt the breakthrough with his own strength—for what he comprehended himself would be most profound.

Alchemy was the best assistance; in the refining process Yang Kai gained many unexpected benefits, his body and mind purified and his soul elevated.

Days passed one by one.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land's renown for alchemy spread across the Tongxuan Continent.

Some traveled over a hundred thousand li without complaint, enduring hardship solely to have the mysterious master of the Sacred Land refine a pill for them.

Outside the Nine Peaks a line stretched for miles; every day several hundred waited, with petitioners constantly joining.

The nameless master within the Sacred Land had godlike alchemical skill; since he began, there had been no failures, and he had produced many pills bearing Pill Patterns.

Gradually people even compared him to Tianzang Elder, wondering who would prevail should the two of them spar.

But Tianzang Elder belonged to legend; even the demon and yao tribes held that elder in great awe and all living beings admired him.

On that point alone the Sacred Land's master could not compare.

As the fame spread, petitioners no longer sought only Spirit-Grade Upper-Level and Saint-Grade Lower-Level pills; even Saint-Grade Middle-Level pills were asked to be refined.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land accepted all, letting those who sought pills depart fully satisfied.

For every pill refined the Sacred Land received rewards and fees equal to the pill's value.

Xu Hui and the others now laughed with delight every day, casting off their previous anxieties.

The Sacred Land's storehouse was piled high with crystal stones and all manner of cultivation supplies, reserves astoundingly vast.

Especially after the mysterious master changed the rule from ten pills a day to twenty, the Sacred Land's gains increased markedly.

Many petitioners not only paid the pill's value but added extra gifts as thanks.

Xu Hui now suspected the Sacred Land harbored more than one alchemist.

If not, how could a single person handle twenty pills a day?

At least three, perhaps even more, Xu Hui guessed inwardly.

The leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan were aware that the Sacred Land's prosperity was largely due to Yang Kai, yet they said little to Xu Hui and the others.

They accepted generous amounts of cultivation supplies from the Sacred Land and focused on developing themselves, rarely leaving their peaks so as not to be discovered and invite trouble.

Xu Hui had been extremely generous in providing the Ancient Demon Clan with what they needed, never skimping; whenever the clan required something, he would fetch it, which made Li Rong very grateful.

...

Outside the Nine Peaks there stood a newly built stone pavilion.

Inside were several exquisite stone stools and a stone table; on the table sat a pot of tea.

Elders Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong sat in the pavilion, sipping tea as they watched the long line and spoke quietly.

So many people came seeking pills that two elders sat here each day to maintain order; today it was Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong's turn.

The two beauties carried different airs, but both were graceful—ample chests, sinuous waists like water snakes, long shapely legs, and firm, perky buttocks outlining a bewitching curve—undoubtedly the loveliest sight outside the Nine Peaks.

The bored, waiting petitioners shot burning glances their way, seeking some small spiritual comfort.

Sensing the odd stares, Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong were displeased but helpless; they pretended not to notice and ordered Sacred Land disciples to form a ring around the pavilion to block onlookers.

They called it maintaining order, but there was little for the disciples to do.

Most who came were honest and well behaved, not cutting in or bullying others.

Occasionally some thoughtless person tried to use status to seize a better spot, but without Sacred Land intervention those strong fighters nearer the front would make them comply.

Most petitioners were Transcendent Realm cultivators, and there were even powerful figures from the Saint Realm among them.

Once one incurred the rage of the crowd, there would be no good outcome.

So Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong simply drank their tea and chatted inside the pavilion to pass the time, quite leisurely.

At the far end of the long line, two women and a middle-aged man were waiting.

The middle-aged man looked somewhat impatient, glancing forward now and then and sighing softly.

With hundreds ahead, and the master refining twenty pills a day, when it reached them it would take at least a month.

One of the two women, when she gazed toward the Nine Peaks, her beautiful eyes were distant, as if harboring a complex, unspeakable emotion.

After a while the middle-aged man lowered his voice and said, "Xuan'er, aren't you acquainted with the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land? Can't you ask him to refine a pill for your father? Since that master belongs to the Sacred Land, he should heed his orders, right?"

"We're only acquaintances; we don't have much intimacy—how could I ask him? He may have already forgotten me," the woman forced a smile, her expression sorrowful.

At this the other woman snorted, "Not that close? That's wrong, isn't it? You are..."

"Xinyu!" the woman glared at her companion. The latter hastily raised a hand and said, "Fine, I won't say it. Your fate is your own choice—don't regret it later!"

The middle-aged man read the situation and chuckled, "Xuan'er, whether it works or not, go try. After all, that Saint Lord used to be part of my Duao Alliance; perhaps he'll feel some old ties."

"He never joined the Duao Alliance, okay? Why do you always think he was one of our disciples?" the woman stamped her foot. "Say that in front of me and it's fine, but don't say it to others—people might think we're sucking up."
