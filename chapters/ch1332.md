## Chapter 1332 — One Move

Seeing Yang Kai show such tact, Fei Zhi Tu's face couldn't help but reveal a trace of satisfaction; earlier, from his secret observation, he had vaguely believed this brat to be lawless and insolent, yet unexpectedly he was also a subtle, perceptive man — his painstaking efforts were not wasted.

The shops and property in the city were indeed severely damaged and burned, but those were after all inanimate things, not worth chasing over; they could be rebuilt later. As for the dozen or so people who died, most were disciples of the Xie Family and had half a hair's relation to Fei Zhi Tu — even if everyone here perished, he wouldn't care.

After a moment's contemplation, Fei Zhi Tu said, "This city lord will point you to two roads; it's up to you which one you choose."

Yang Kai put on an expression of attentive listening.

"First, hand over the Saint Crystal you just obtained as compensation. You can't commit murder and arson and simply walk away. Those Saint Crystals are enough to make amends. What do you think?"

At these words, the goat‑bearded elder and the others' faces shifted slightly; they immediately realized that the worries they'd felt earlier were true — the city lord truly meant to make a big matter small, and a small matter vanish. Coupled with some rumors circulating in the hall, their hearts sank and they dared not say more.

Yang Kai's eyes showed surprise; tilting his head to think for a moment, he gave a carefree smile. "Your suggestion is not without merit, but forgive this junior for daring to decline!"

"Huh?" Fei Zhi Tu narrowed his eyes and looked at Yang Kai with some surprise. To be honest, he proposed that compensation because he was the strongest here and, as the city's lord, thought Ma Xinyuan and the others wouldn't object to him. He never expected his goodwill would be unappreciated; anger briefly flared in his heart as he scorned Yang Kai for not knowing his place. He snorted coldly, "You dare reject it without even hearing the second road?"

Yang Kai composed himself and said solemnly, "One of my purposes in coming is to take back the Saint Crystals that were stolen. Now that they're in my hands, there's no reason to return them. Senior, please tell me what the second road is."

Fei Zhi Tu stared at him for a long moment before saying, "Since you are so determined, this city lord will not persuade you. The second road is simpler: don't dodge, don't evade, take one of my moves head‑on; as long as you don't die, I'll let you leave!"

"Take one of your moves head‑on?" Yang Kai's eyelids tightened; conversely, Ma Xinyuan and the others who heard this burst into delight.

Fei Zhi Tu was already at the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and in strength almost on par with Qian Tong. With such an expert personally making a move, even if it was only one strike, that arrogant brat couldn't expect to walk away unscathed — he might even die from that single blow.

Ma Xinyuan and the others inwardly rejoiced, thinking they had misjudged Fei Zhi Tu earlier; he clearly never intended to let the brat go. Due to the gap in status and cultivation it would be improper to bully the small without cause, but since Yang Kai had volunteered, there was nothing more to say. They looked at Yang Kai with schadenfreude, eager for the show to begin.

"Afraid?" Fei Zhi Tu jeered at Yang Kai.

“What would I have to fear!” A brilliant light flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes, sharp and dazzling. Against a Third-Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivator, he indeed wasn’t strong enough to truly contend, but if it was only to take one move, it shouldn’t be a problem. Besides, even if he were injured, with his recovery ability, he would surely heal in no time.

It was also an opportunity to probe how far he lagged behind this rank of fighters.

On Dark Star, the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm was the strongest tier; if he could walk away unscathed from Fei Zhi Tu's hands, he could reassess his own strength.

"Brat, you have guts!" The soft expression on Fei Zhi Tu's face suddenly twisted into a feral smile. He shouted, "I hope you won't regret this!"

Yang Kai's face grew cold and silent. He extended a finger and the fire bird that circled above his head let out a sharp cry. It transformed into a ball of flame that wrapped his entire body, red blaze swirling and the space around him warping.

Yang Kai then summoned his Purple Shield and poured Saint Yuan into it; a sandstorm suddenly formed, winds and dust raging, burying his figure within.

In the next instant, shields condensed from pitch‑black flames floated before Yang Kai — they were the Vast Heaven Shields he had formed with his own Saint Yuan!

Those three defenses had barely finished forming when a grotesque surge of Saint Yuan rippled from Fei Zhi Tu. In the blink of an eye he stepped forward and, unseen by others, appeared ten zhang from Yang Kai.

Suddenly, a tiger roar erupted from within him and a huge tiger head leisurely manifested above his body. At first it was a phantom, but as Fei Zhi Tu poured Saint Yuan into it, it gradually began to take on substance.

At the same time, an unparalleled ferocity issued from the tiger's head.

The onlookers such as Ma Xinyuan changed color and quickly backed away. Although Fei Zhi Tu hadn't targeted them, the murderous intent emanating from that tiger head felt tangible, like blades of wind cutting at them and sending chills through their bodies.

"The city lord is getting serious!" The crowd cheered privately.

"Boy, be careful!" Fei Zhi Tu roared. The tiger head above him suddenly opened its bloodthirsty maw and, like a tiger descending the mountain with a weight of ten thousand jun, lunged toward where Yang Kai stood.

Yang Kai's face darkened as he frantically guided Saint Yuan.

The next moment, the now‑materialized tiger head collided with the outermost Vast Heaven Shields with a series of crackling sounds. Dozens of Vast Heaven Shields shattered like paper, yet the tiger head's momentum was undiminished, still plowing toward the second layer — the sandstorm.

The sandstorm was driven by the stored power within the Purple Shield, immense in force. Once the tiger head plunged into it, sand and wind blocked its advance and its motion faltered, as if about to stop.

But Yang Kai did not rejoice; his face turned even grimmer.

Fei Zhi Tu let out a cold laugh. As his Divine Sense surged, the tiger’s head suddenly spewed out a ball of ghostly light. The moment it appeared, it exploded, tearing a gaping hole through the sandstorm. At the same time, the tiger’s head seized the opening and rushed in, the sandstorm no longer able to hinder it in the slightest.

In the span of a blink, the massive tiger head had already arrived before Yang Kai, its blood‑filled maw wide, snapping to bite him.

Yang Kai dared not slack; with a thought the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird surrounding his body whirled into motion, making him appear as if engulfed in flames, radiating an extremely high temperature.

The tiger's roar and the bird's cry intertwined, a sound that never ceased.

Ma Xinyuan and the others craned their necks to see whether Yang Kai had been grievously wounded or killed, but their view was blocked by the sandstorm; they couldn't see a thing and fretted restlessly.

A few people, however, inferred from Fei Zhi Tu's unexpected expression that Yang Kai was not seriously hurt.

Boom — with a rumble, the sandstorm suddenly collapsed, reforming into a single purple‑tinged shield that flew aside. At the same time Yang Kai's figure leapt back, his face pale; the Fire Bird that hovered about his body had once again settled above his head, and though the tiger head's color had dimmed somewhat it still pursued him closely, intent on slaying him.

Hovering mid‑air, Yang Kai's expression turned grim. As he swung both hands, streaks of jet‑black Space Blades sliced out, meeting the tiger head.

Seeing this, Fei Zhi Tu's brow knit and then, as if realizing something, his face changed greatly and he cried out, "Stop!"

No sooner had the words fallen than he surged forward and appeared before the tiger head. One hand reached out and absorbed the tiger head into his body, while the other presented the Blue Jade Bowl. From the bowl poured a dazzling blue radiance to confront the Space Blades.

Hissssss...

The blue light instantly diminished greatly; Fei Zhi Tu's face twitched and he could not hide a look of sharp pain.

That Blue Jade Bowl was a secret treasure he had been refining for years and his most relied upon item. The blue light stored within held all sorts of strange and wondrous powers; in past battles he had often used it to turn danger into safety. Now he clearly felt that some of the bowl's blue light had been lost — and he did not know where it had gone.

Coupled with the bizarre space‑rending blades, his face turned extremely ugly.

The lost blue light would take him at least several years to replenish, and would cost him precious heaven‑and‑earth treasures to do so.

In that moment he even harbored the thought of killing Yang Kai. Even against an opponent of the same rank, no one should suffer such a heavy loss; he could not believe that a mere Saint King Realm could achieve such an outcome.

When Fei Zhi Tu used the Blue Jade Bowl, Yang Kai stopped attacking, lightly stepping back and retracting his shields. He drew several deep breaths and his pale face regained some color. Only then did he look at Fei Zhi Tu with knitted brows and an odd expression.

"You..." Fei Zhi Tu glanced at his Blue Jade Bowl and then at Yang Kai; his face contorted into extreme ferocity.

Yang Kai chuckled softly, "Senior, you used your second move."

Fei Zhi Tu was taken aback and could only force a wry smile. He stared at Yang Kai long and hard, then waved his hand in an unenthusiastic gesture. "Go, go! Do not set foot in Tianyun City again, or don't blame this city lord for being uncivil to you."

"Thank you for your mercy, Senior. If possible, please also return the fragment of flame you absorbed earlier!" Yang Kai looked at the Blue Jade Bowl in his hand and said lightly.

Fei Zhi Tu's face twitched. He extended a strand of Saint Yuan into the Blue Jade Bowl and a flash of flame immediately flew out. The artifact spirit Fire Bird opened its beak and swallowed the flame; after a single circle it dove into Yang Kai's body and vanished.

It wasn't that Fei Zhi Tu was particularly magnanimous; he simply found that the flame the Blue Jade Bowl had absorbed earlier was strange and he couldn't refine it. If it remained sealed in the bowl for long it would not only affect the secret treasure's power but might harm the bowl itself; naturally he was happy to do a favor.

"Farewell!" Yang Kai cupped his fist, cast an icy glance at Ma Xinyuan and the others as if to engrave their faces in his memory, then coldly chuckled. He summoned the Star Shuttle and flew off toward Dragon Lair Mountain.
