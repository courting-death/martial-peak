## Chapter 215 — Cooperation

“Now you should understand why I said that killing there requires no reason or excuse, right? The blood beads obtained after a kill are the best excuse and reason! In that place, a life is merely a stepping stone to becoming stronger, especially since you are only at the third stage of the Separation and Union Realm, making you more susceptible to being targeted,” Ling Taixu said in a deep voice.

Yang Kai's expression revealed shock, but more than that, it was excitement and surprise.

Ling Taixu, with keen insight, observed Yang Kai's expression and couldn't help but sigh inwardly, thinking that this kid truly intended to use killing as proof of his martial path.

If it were another martial artist at the third stage of the Separation and Union Realm who heard such things, they would likely only feel fear and want to escape. Yet here was Yang Kai, brimming with eagerness, wishing he could immediately rush to that place and immerse himself in endless slaughter.

In that place, there was no need to worry about harming the innocent; even if Yang Kai did not take the initiative to kill, there would still be people coming to kill him. Moreover, there were many evil martial artists there, all of whom deserved to die.

Along the way, Ling Taixu shared much information about that place, as he had trained there many years ago and had firsthand experience, which was invaluable.

Yang Kai listened intently, not daring to miss a single detail.

According to Ling Taixu, that place was located in the Ghostly Underworld Mountain, yet it did not truly belong to the Ghostly Underworld Mountain; it was a peculiar space, and the entrance was in a lake within the Ghostly Underworld Mountain.

No one knew what kind of extraordinary energy and rules of heaven and earth existed within, but as long as a living being died there, their energy and the essence of their flesh would condense into blood beads, including both humans and demon beasts! These blood beads could be consumed directly or taken out for others to use, and their value was considerable. Moreover, the stronger the individual or demon beast that died, the higher the value of the blood bead, and the greater the enhancement it could provide.

Additionally, in that place, all offensive and defensive treasures would have no effect whatsoever, as they seemed to be sealed by some invisible energy. Upon hearing this, Yang Kai's heart sank.

With his current strength only at the third stage of the Separation and Union Realm, who knew how many True Essence Realm experts would flock there? If he encountered such experts, without the Shura Sword or the Blood Sea Begonia to assist him, he would surely be at a disadvantage, and it was highly likely he would be killed.

However, thinking that others would be in the same predicament brought Yang Kai some balance.

That peculiar place opened once every ten years, and Yang Kai was fortunate this time to have just returned to the Lingxiao Pavilion in time. If he had returned a few months later, he would have certainly missed it.

Finally, Ling Taixu solemnly handed Yang Kai a small cloth bag.

This bag was only about the size of a palm. It was engraved with many intricate patterns and made of strange materials, looking quite exquisite.

“What is this?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

“I call it the Qian Kun Bag. Don’t be fooled by its small size; it actually has great significance and can hold a substantial amount of items,” Ling Taixu replied.

Yang Kai was taken aback again. He looked at Ling Taixu in surprise, not expecting that even such a legendary treasure, specifically used for storage, would be possessed by Ling Taixu.

“It’s all left behind by our ancestor. There’s probably only this one in the entire Great Han, not even the Eight Great Families among you possess one,” Ling Taixu said casually.

Oh, wait, Meng Wuya might have one too, but that old thing hoards treasures and doesn’t share them with anyone except his disciples, truly petty.

“I’ve prepared some pills for you inside. Use them sparingly,” Ling Taixu instructed.

“Thank you, Master! When I return, I will return this bag to you,” Yang Kai said, solemnly tucking the small bag into his bosom.

This item was indeed a supreme treasure; a storage treasure was something that people only heard rumors about but had never seen.

However, Yang Kai had a Wordless Black Book made from a Soul-Calming Stone in his possession, which could also be used to refine storage treasures, and its grade was certainly much higher than that of the Qian Kun Bag.

Yet, Yang Kai now possessed a mountain of treasures but did not know how to utilize them, which was truly tragic.

After flying for about a day, a deep and continuous mountain range, exuding an eerie aura, appeared before Ling Taixu and Yang Kai.

Ghostly Underworld Mountain! The only forbidden area in the Great Han! A desolate and ancient atmosphere rushed toward them, as if this forbidden area had been lying here since ancient times like a giant dragon, sending chills down one’s spine.

As they approached the mountain, before they could enter, two teams suddenly charged out from either side.

On the left came six people, and upon closer inspection, Yang Kai realized they were all women. This group was led by an old woman and a beautiful matron, with four young girls following behind.

The four young girls wore small bells on their wrists and ankles, and as they ran, the crisp sound of the bells rang out, like a mountain stream, refreshing to the ears.

Moreover, all these women were exceptionally beautiful; the matron was regal and voluptuous, with her long black hair styled into an elegant bun, exposing her fair and slender neck, radiating a mature and alluring beauty. Especially her pair of eyes, which sparkled with autumn waves, captivating and enchanting, as if they could speak, making the sky bluer and the flowers more fragrant.

The four young girls were equally charming, at the age of blossoming youth, gracefully approaching with their delicate arms partially exposed, each with skin as white as snow, surpassing frost, with dainty feet and exquisite toes, creating a unique beauty. They smiled sweetly, some shy, some beautiful, some cold as ice, and some passionate like fire. Together, they could drive any man mad. Although the young girls’ charm was not as mature and enticing as that of the matron, they possessed their own fresh and captivating allure.

The old woman, though appearing very aged, still bore traces of her former beauty, which time had marked with many indelible scars.

This group stopped about thirty zhang away from Yang Kai and Ling Taixu, and the old woman glanced at the two with a faint hum.

Clearly, those who came to Ghostly Underworld Mountain at this time shared the same purpose.

The entrance to that peculiar space was limited, making them competitors.

Ling Taixu smiled slightly at the old woman and whispered to Yang Kai, “They are from the first-rate sect, Wan Hua Palace. Young people are impulsive; be careful not to fall for these little girls’ tricks in there, or else you’ll be devoured without even leaving bones behind.”

Yang Kai’s eyes sparkled as he scrutinized the four young girls. Hearing Ling Taixu’s words, he immediately straightened his expression, “Master, don’t worry, I will be careful.”

Moments later, the group on the right also arrived. Looking over, Yang Kai saw that the leader was an old man of similar age to Ling Taixu, followed by three young people, both male and female, each with formidable strength, but regardless of gender, they all exuded a somewhat sinister aura.

The two young men were even bolder than Yang Kai, their eyes nearly glued to the Wan Hua Palace female disciples, causing the girls beside them to frown in displeasure, unable to suppress a hum.

“These are people from Ghost King Valley,” Ling Taixu’s expression darkened. “You’re in trouble.”

“Why?” Yang Kai asked, confused.

“Because I had a few encounters with that old man across from me in the past; this is an evil sect. You must be careful of their skills,” Ling Taixu replied.

Yang Kai focused his gaze and indeed saw that the hands of the three people opposite were somewhat strange; unlike ordinary people, they lacked blood color and appeared ghostly pale, looking like terrifying claws.

The old man opposite suddenly let out a cold laugh, “Ling Taixu! You’re still alive!”

Ling Taixu snorted lightly, “Gui Li, you’re not dead either!”

“Good, good, good.” Gui Li grinned savagely, “I was worried you’d die and I wouldn’t find anyone to take revenge on. I didn’t expect to run into you here today; truly a blessing from the heavens.”

“What? Fifty years ago, was it not enough of a lesson for you? Today you wish to seek death?” Ling Taixu sneered, showing no fear.

Gui Li’s expression twisted, “Old grievances, what’s the point of bringing them up? Fifty years ago, I lost to you, but that doesn’t mean I will lose again fifty years later!”

“Want to give it a try?” Ling Taixu replied with a proud smile.

Gui Li’s eyes were as eerie as ghostly flames, staring at Ling Taixu with a hint of trepidation.

The two faced off, and the three disciples from Ghost King Valley behind Gui Li glared at Yang Kai as well.

Yang Kai grinned at them, his expression unchanged.

“Bang!” A sound echoed as the old woman from Wan Hua Palace struck the ground with her dragon-headed cane.

“If the two of you do not wish to fight, why not discuss teaming up to enter Ghostly Underworld Mountain?” The old woman looked at Ling Taixu and Gui Li calmly.

Although Ling Taixu and Gui Li had grievances, they truly did not want to fight right now, as they had brought people for training. If they missed the timing, it could ruin everything. The old woman was perceptive and saw that both needed a way out, which was why she spoke up.

Gui Li chuckled, “I’ll give Palace Master Yan face this time and won’t hold it against you. Once this matter is over, Ling Taixu, we will definitely have a battle!”

“Anytime!” 

Gui Li’s gaze was cold as he scrutinized Yang Kai, showing no intention of hiding his intentions. He turned to his three disciples and said, “Remember this kid’s appearance. Kill him once we’re inside!”

“Yes!” The three replied coldly.

Yang Kai’s expression turned icy as he secretly memorized their appearances.

With the old woman from Wan Hua Palace mediating, Ling Taixu and Gui Li temporarily set aside their grievances. The three of them quickly discussed, with the old woman leading the way, followed closely by the four young girls, Gui Li in the middle coordinating, accompanied by his three disciples. Yang Kai and Ling Taixu brought up the rear.

As for the beautiful matron, she was also in a central position, but one was on the left and the other on the right of Gui Li.

With these four Divine Roaming Realm experts guarding them, the younger generation of disciples could be said to be extremely safe, provided that Ling Taixu and Gui Li did not play any tricks on each other.

Ling Taixu would naturally not act maliciously, but it was hard to say the same for Gui Li. It was precisely because of this concern that the old woman had Ling Taixu take the rear to prevent Gui Li from launching a sneak attack.

Fortunately, Gui Li was also a sensible person; as they proceeded, he did not make any moves, honestly staying in his position.

Ghostly Underworld Mountain had a notorious reputation, and everyone entered cautiously, holding their breath, for even at the outermost edges, they might encounter powerful demon beasts of the fifth or sixth rank.

The women from Wan Hua Palace seemed to have used some method, as the bells on their wrists and ankles did not make a sound at this moment. The group moved silently.
