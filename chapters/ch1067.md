## Chapter 1067 — Third Stage of the Saint Realm

Zong Ao's worries were not without reason; even great powers won't push their young disciples to grow beyond what they can bear—there's no benefit in forcing them past their limits.

And now, everything Yang Kai is doing clearly goes far beyond what a martial artist of his level should be able to endure.

Even a cultivator of the First or Second Stage of the Saint King Realm would likely be unable to endure it for long.

Whether Yang Kai lived or died had nothing to do with Zong Ao. What Zong Ao cared about was that one arrogant claim made in their earlier wager—whether he could truly refine a Leaving Flame Pill that produced a Pill Cloud!

Though Zong Ao had not the slightest belief in his heart, he still couldn’t help but hold onto a sliver of hope—hope that Yang Kai could truly do as he claimed, and make him concede defeat wholeheartedly!

Pill Patterns have been his lifelong pursuit; for them he abandoned lofty rank and easy riches to remain here refining pills—one hundred years gone in a single stretch of alchemy. More than anyone, he longed for a reliable method to grasp those ethereal Pill Patterns or a Pill Cloud.

Therefore, even if it was just a faint glimmer of hope—or merely the boastful words of a youth—Zong Ao still couldn’t help but want to see the outcome for himself. For that reason, he did not wish for any accident to befall Yang Kai.

His worries proved pointless.

Ever since Yang Kai set up the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags array and began cultivating, Zong Ao hadn't refined a single pill for a month; instead he quietly observed him from somewhere in the palace. He watched in horror as that kid's body erupted with qi-and-blood power beyond imagination; he was horrified to see energies that could make Saint King Realm practitioners explode poured into the boy's body and be effortlessly accepted with no discomfort; even more terrifying, the boy's power fluctuations were growing day by day.

Not only did he show no sign of pain, he actually enjoyed it. Each day he remained in high spirits, making Zong Ao almost unable to believe his eyes.

As time passed, a faint yellow halo quietly lit around Yang Kai's body; at first the hue was hardly noticeable, but as more and more Spiritual Qi poured in it became increasingly bright.

Thick Heavenly Spiritual Qi swirled around him like mist, lingering and not dispersing.

It made the several hundred mu of Zong Ao's medicinal fields steam with vapor. The herbs planted there grew faster than before.

With such concentrated Spiritual Qi converging, it would be strange if the herbs did not flourish.

For a time the valley nearly became the spot where Rainfall Star's Heaven-and-Earth Energy was the densest; even the mountain palaces housing the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch could not compare.

By his power alone he had altered the Heaven-and-Earth Energy over a vast area, turning this place into a rare blessed grotto; in all his life Zong Ao had never encountered such a strange phenomenon.

"Who is this?" Zong Ao could not fathom it; he slowly shook his head, realized his worries had been fed to the dog's belly, and after a month of observation stopped bothering with Yang Kai. He went to the Alchemy Room, lit dozens of furnaces, and began his grand alchemical enterprise!

He finally understood. With Yang Kai's monstrous talent, there was no way he could bring himself harm through cultivation.

Zong Ao clearly saw him shoveling cultivation pills into his mouth one after another; Upper-Level Saint Crystals on his hands were exchanged again and again…

No matter his present strength, one day he would surely become a dazzling new star in the Star Domain! Zong Ao was certain in his heart.

......

Taking advantage of the quarterly chance to deliver herbs to Zong Ao, Lin Mufeng personally handed him several special Spatial Rings.

Those Spatial Rings were packed full of the medicinal ingredients Yang Kai needed. To save the comatose Xue Yue, Lin Mufeng and the others paid dearly; these materials were purchased with their own money and could not be charged to the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

After purchasing all those herbs, the few of them saw their fortunes nearly halved.

Once Zong Ao took the Spatial Rings he closed the palace gates, not even entertaining the idea of letting Lin Mufeng come in for a short visit.

Lin Mufeng dared not put on airs; he stood awkwardly outside, staring at that sea-like medicine field with bright eyes.

Through the thick barrier of Heaven-and-Earth Energy he discovered Yang Kai's oddity.

Which Saint Realm disciple could cultivate with such madness? From his demeanor it was clear he had been at it a long time with no ill effects; regardless of anything else, the kid's bodily strength seemed unusually distinct.

After watching for a while, Lin Mufeng slipped away quietly, not disturbing Yang Kai.

As the sun sank and the moon rose, Yang Kai sat motionless in the medicine field. On his chest, the infant face pattern that had appeared after consuming the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid was greedily devouring the surrounding Spiritual Qi, gulp after gulp. At the same time, the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags continuously exerted their effect, drawing vast amounts of Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth toward this place.

The Snow Pool Crystal Essence's effect continued to this day without a hint of weakening; his state of mind remained steady as ever, with no great fluctuations.

He took pill after pill to assist his cultivation, and the few hundred remaining Upper-Level Saint Crystals were completely exhausted!

Yang Kai had never before cultivated so madly and continuously as this time.

His cultivation at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm climbed steadily; the power contained in his body grew ever greater, and he gradually reached the threshold of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

At last one day jet-black Demonic Flame erupted from his body, rolling without end, as if about to burn the heavens and earth.

Outside the palace Zong Ao's face was grim; he said nothing and observed Yang Kai's changes from afar.

The Demonic Flame swelled; gradually the flame pouring from Yang Kai's body seemed to take on a life of its own, coalescing into the shape of a giant dragon. The golden dragon that normally drifted across his body was likewise provoked and moved ever more quickly.

A loud, high dragon roar sounded; the golden dragon left his body, merged with the Demonic Flame, and writhed and rolled among the clouds.

The ink-black giant dragon occasionally flashed specks of gold, enshrouding heaven and earth.

The giant dragon opened its huge mouth, inhaling and exhaling Heaven-and-Earth Energy; each breath cleared the foggy valley a little, and after a dozen breaths the once pitch-dark valley regained its clarity as the accumulated Heaven-and-Earth Energy was absorbed and assimilated by the black dragon.

Another dragon cry rang out as the flaming giant plunged downward and shot straight into Yang Kai's body.

Yang Kai quivered with a thunderous shake; an invisible shockwave centered on him suddenly spread outward, tossing up sand and stone, making trees sway, and uprooting massive trunks that were blown far away.

He slowly opened his eyes; sparks of divine light flickered in them, and the faint glow around his body rapidly contracted and soon vanished.

He had reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm!

A single frenzied seclusion had at last permitted Yang Kai to step into the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

On the Tongxuan Continent such a cultivation level already placed one among the very peak; whether Demon Lord Changyuan, his Four Great Demon Generals, or human figures like Meng Wuya and Chu Lingxiao, or yao Great Lords such as Lei Long and Old Ox, their cultivations were all at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

There were merely subtle differences between them at that height.

And today Yang Kai truly stood on the same level as those experts.

Yet across the Star Domain, such a Realm is pitifully low; without connections, one could not rely on any great power.

Practitioners of this level are numerous in the Star Domain; though not the very lowest, they possess little standing.

"Kid, congratulations." Zong Ao strode over. "To break into the Third Stage in only three months—though aided by a wondrous treasure—still surpasses my expectations. I thought you'd take at least five or six months. Seems your talent is truly fine."

"Thank you, Elder Zong." Yang Kai did not rise; he only gave a faint nod, neither overly excited nor dejected, as if everything were perfectly natural and deserved.

Zong Ao was astonished, recognizing that Yang Kai's state of mind had not fractured with the rapid rise in power, knowing that was due to the Snow Pool Crystal Essence and his own perseverance and experience.

"Elder Zong, any news from Halika?" Yang Kai inquired.

“Last time, Lin Mufeng sent over several rings’ worth of medicinal ingredients,” Zong Ao said unhurriedly, “but there’s still one thing missing—the Dragon Turtle Spirit Fruit. According to him, Halika has already arranged for someone to transfer it from another Medicine Star, and it should arrive in about a month or two.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly; though not close with Halika and the others, he knew they would not be sloppy in this matter—the arrival of the Dragon Turtle Spirit Fruit was only a matter of time.

"I'll go see my Lady." Yang Kai said as he stood, still not putting away the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags.

In the side chamber Xue Yue still lay as if asleep, her expression tranquil; perhaps from long lack of visitors, a thick layer of dust had settled on her body and face. Looking at that alluringly beautiful face, Yang Kai fetched water to give her a wash.

Perhaps under the Snow Pool Crystal Essence's influence, Yang Kai did this with a calm heart, without any emotional fluctuation, treating her like a stranger.

He had already decided that once he revived Xue Yue he would immediately sever all ties with her; whether she sought revenge or not, Yang Kai did not want to have any further entanglement.

His kindness toward Xue Yue was compulsory, not like the feelings that had grown over time for Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, which had developed gradually and naturally.

He believed Xue Yue felt likewise; with that woman's temper, once freed from the constraint of the Soul Chain she would likely act ruthlessly to protect her honor and secrets.

For whatever reason, she would not permit Yang Kai to live in this world; after this emotional entanglement the two were destined to become enemies.

After tidying everything, Yang Kai once more came outside the palace, sat where he had been cultivating before, and continued to run his cultivation method.

Having just broken into the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, even with the Snow Pool Crystal Essence stabilizing his mind and preventing sudden mental ruptures, Yang Kai needed to consolidate his Realm in the shortest time possible and, ideally, rise another step from his current foundation.

His expectations were modest—he knew he could not hope to breakthrough to the Saint King Realm within a few years; he only sought one more step and not to waste the Heaven Spirit Ghost Orchid's duration. That thing could only last two or three years, each day shortening its effect.
