## Chapter 271 â€” Total Collapse

In just a short span of ten breaths, an alchemist who had consumed a Poison Pill turned pale, suddenly trembling without warning, cold sweat pouring from his forehead.

The crowd below gasped in shock, never expecting the potency of the Poison Pill crafted by Master Xiao to be so formidable.

Before the gasps faded, three loud sounds of "puff" echoed from the stage, followed by an inexplicable foul odor wafting through the air.

It turned out that the alchemist, caught off guard, had let out several loud farts.

Many nearby were momentarily oblivious, inhaling the stench, nearly retching on the spot, their faces filled with disgust.

The alchemist who had participated in the test felt his pale face turn beet red in an instant, not due to the effects of the pill, but from embarrassment.

How could he endure releasing three foul farts in front of so many eyes?

Feeling countless gazes filled with pity, disgust, and contempt upon him, the alchemist was utterly humiliated, hurriedly standing up and leaping down from the high platform, fleeing like a stray dog.

"How dare he participate in Master Xiao's test with such incompetence, overestimating himself!"

"What a disgrace, he has embarrassed his ancestors!"

"Which family's alchemist is this? How will he face others in the future?"

The mocking voices from behind felt like needles in his back, making him not dare to linger, and in the blink of an eye, he vanished into the crowd.

Before the spectators could recover from the sight of that person's disgrace, a light "thud" sounded from the high platform. Upon closer inspection, the two alchemists who had just consumed the Poison Pill had fallen backward, their eyes wide open, remaining in a meditative posture, completely unconscious.

The three young disciples of Yao Wang Valley exchanged glances, snorted coldly, and walked over to kick the two off the platform.

Their demeanor was indifferent, their expressions haughty, as if they were merely kicking two objects rather than people.

But no one dared to criticize them. They had already informed everyone that this batch crafted by Master Xiao was a Poison Pill, and those who dared to consume it should be prepared for the consequences.

"They're not dead!" Someone went up to check the two's aura, discovering they were still alive, but for some unknown reason, they remained motionless, unable to be awakened even with shouts.

"It's so hot, so hot!" Another alchemist suddenly sprang up from the high platform, his exposed skin red as blood, emanating an overwhelming heat. He was tearing at his clothes, and in no time, he was bare-chested, seemingly oblivious to it, still pulling at his garments.

Dong Qingyan's face flushed, and she quickly covered her eyes with her hands.

Several martial artists rushed up from below, their faces ashen, dragging the man down. These martial artists were likely from the same family as the alchemist and did not want to witness his disgrace.

In less than thirty breaths, the first batch of alchemists who had tested the pill was completely wiped out!

The symptoms after being poisoned were bizarre and varied. Such a tragic outcome did not deter the alchemists from their determination to join Hidden Cloud Peak; instead, it only fueled their enthusiasm.

Master Xiao's creation of that Poison Pill was clearly the same type of pill, yet it produced so many different effects. Truly, he was a master of his craft.

Because of this, the alchemists present felt that Master Xiao's alchemical skills were unfathomable, beyond the grasp of ordinary people.

After this batch of people left in dejection, another thirty stepped up.

Time passed, and more and more people were poisoned, some fainting, others displaying all sorts of embarrassing behaviors. Over two hundred individuals had participated, yet not a single one passed Master Xiao's test.

The atmosphere at the testing site was filled with despair.

Another batch fell victim to the poison, and one alchemist, stiff as a stone yet conscious, shouted, "I refuse to accept this! How can a mere Poison Pill determine my extraordinary qualifications? I refuse! I want to go to Hidden Cloud Peak to see Master Xiao! Master Xiao, please give me a chance!"

"Drag him away!" Qin Ze coldly commanded.

The three young disciples of Yao Wang Valley, with cold expressions, approached the man and directly tossed him off the high platform.

The man continued to shout, "Master Xiao, I can inherit your legacy! Please give me a chance!"

"This group has gone mad," Yang Kai observed coldly, shaking his head.

Dong Qingyan whispered, "You don't understand Master Xiao's prestige in the alchemical world, which is why you say that. Look at that man; even in such a disgraceful state, has anyone mocked him?"

Yang Kai turned to look and indeed found that no one was mocking him; most wore indifferent expressions, with many showing sympathy.

"To us alchemists, the master is an existence above all. To enter his sect, enduring some hardship and losing face is nothing," Dong Qingyan said, biting her red lip, her face filled with anxiety and anticipation.

"Are you sure you want to go up and consume that Poison Pill?" Yang Kai chuckled, "You saw those people's reactions; fainting and collapsing is considered fortunate. If you fail this test and end up tearing off your clothes on the spot..."

Dong Qingyan's pretty face turned pale.

"Well, everyone here is young; I imagine they would love to see that scene. Tsk tsk, the young lady of the Dong Family in disarray, that would be quite the topic of conversation after a meal."

"That can't be!"

"Even if it doesn't go that far, if you let out a few loud farts in public..."

"Stop talking!" Dong Qingyan's face lost color.

No matter what kind of embarrassment it was, it was something this young girl could not accept. It would be a lifelong shadow; once it happened, she would never be able to hold her head high again.

Glaring fiercely at Yang Kai, Dong Qingyan waved her small fist, "I knew you had bad intentions, wanting me to return to my brother, but I must try this test! I've prepared for this day for a long time; having come this far, how can I give up?"

Saying this, her voice softened, her face flushed, "If it really turns out like you said... you must take me away early..."

Yang Kai shook his head slightly; it seemed his cousin was determined to go on stage, and no amount of persuasion would change her mind now.

Another wave of commotion arose from the crowd: "An Earth-Grade Upper-Level alchemist! Isn't that Wang Qiren, the alchemical genius cultivated by the Wang Family? He's here too?"

"If it's him, he might really pass Master Xiao's test."

"Indeed. This will be interesting."

"Look at that one, an Earth-Grade Middle-Level alchemist, cultivated by the Xiong Family."

"That one too, another Earth-Grade Middle-Level alchemist, from the Chang Family."

"The alchemists from the great families are finally stepping up; a good show is about to begin."

The alchemists stepping up this time were all young alchemists cultivated by those great families. They had come here to inherit Master Xiao Fusheng's legacy.

The previous participants were all alchemists from small places, so it was normal that none could pass the test. Now seeing this group step up, many were eagerly anticipating.

The crowd buzzed with discussion, the noise reaching the ears of the dozen or so Earth-Grade Upper-Level alchemists on the stage, their expressions revealing pride.

They also displayed good manners; upon reaching the high platform, they first bowed to Qin Ze, performing the disciple's salute, before stepping forward to stand before the medicinal cauldron.

"Wang brother, please go ahead. Among us, you are the only one who has reached the Earth-Grade Upper-Level alchemist standard, so you should go first," the alchemist from the Chang Family smiled, gesturing with his hand. The others echoed in agreement.

Wang Qiren smiled slightly, clasped his fists, and said, "If that's the case, then I shall not stand on ceremony."

After saying this, he turned and bowed toward the direction of Hidden Cloud Peak before taking out a Poison Pill. Without a care, he placed it in his mouth and walked aside to sit down and refine it.

His demeanor clearly indicated that he was determined to pass this test, confident in his abilities, otherwise, he wouldn't have bowed toward Hidden Cloud Peak.

That was the mountain where Xiao Fusheng resided.

The three disciples of Yao Wang Valley exchanged glances, unable to suppress their sneers.

So what if he was an Earth-Grade Upper-Level? The Poison Pill crafted by Master Xiao? Even a Heaven-Grade alchemist would face trouble if their qualifications weren't sufficient.

Wang Qiren truly considered himself a figure of importance! The three shared a knowing glance, secretly mocking, and awaited the unfolding of events, ready to watch Wang Qiren's embarrassment.

Before long, this group had all consumed the Poison Pill and found their positions to sit down.

The crowd held their breath, each person craning their necks to observe, feeling even more anxious than if they were participating in the test themselves.

As expected from the alchemists of great powers, each was remarkable, with exceptional qualifications. The previous participants had barely lasted half a tea's worth of time.

However, this group took a full tea time before showing any reactions.

First, an Earth-Grade Lower-Level alchemist suddenly foamed at the mouth and fell unconscious.

Then, someone burst out from the high platform, and several muffled fart sounds echoed.

One after another, these alchemists from the great powers began to have problems, leaving everyone dumbfounded.

It wasn't that these people were undeserving of their fame; it was that the difficulty of Master Xiao's test had exceeded everyone's imagination.

After a stick of incense, only Wang Qiren remained on the stage, while all the others had retreated in dejection.

Countless hearts were tense; if even Wang Qiren couldn't pass this test, they truly had no idea who could.

After a long while, Wang Qiren suddenly moved, a faint black aura appearing between his brows.

Qin Ze, who had been sitting still and unmoving since the test began, suddenly focused his gaze, his eyes shining as he closely watched Wang Qiren's reaction.

As time passed, the black aura became more pronounced and solid.

Suddenly, that black aura vanished without a trace, and Wang Qiren let out a loud retch, spewing out a mouthful of black blood!

A wave of gasps erupted from the crowd; this reaction from Wang Qiren was the first they had seen, and it was unclear whether he had passed the test.

Several martial artists from the Wang Family rushed up, hurrying to Wang Qiren's side.

Wang Qiren waved his hand, struggling to stand, his face filled with expectation as he looked toward Qin Ze.

Qin Ze sighed lightly, "Failure!"

Wang Qiren's expression darkened, but he did not lose heart. He clasped his fists and asked, "May I ask, senior, what constitutes passing the test?"

Seeing that he was somewhat of an alchemical talent, Qin Ze patiently replied, "Actually, you were only one step away from passing just now; it's a pity... you fell short at the last moment!"

"Thank you for your guidance!" Wang Qiren forced a bitter smile and jumped down from the high platform with the other martial artists.
