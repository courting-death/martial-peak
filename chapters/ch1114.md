## Chapter 1114 — Breaking Out of the Shell

Four drops of Golden Blood — normally, if Yang Kai were to rely on seated cultivation, he would need to meditate for twelve months, a full year, to accumulate enough Saint Yuan to transmute into these four drops of Golden Blood.

The Divine Tree absorbed it clean in but a moment.

Just as Yang Kai was about to ask what was happening, the Divine Tree sent a message: "Um… I seem to be falling asleep again."

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai cried out in alarm, thinking perhaps the life-force contained within the Golden Blood was so rampant that even the Divine Tree could not withstand it.

"This is a good thing," the Divine Tree said. "I think after I wake I will advance in rank. Don’t worry. If you have time, take a look at those two jet-black stones — they seem a bit off." With that it truly fell into slumber; no matter how Yang Kai called, there was no reply.

The Divine Tree could advance too? Yang Kai wore a strange expression, but since it said so he had no reason to doubt it. He found himself looking forward to its next awakening, curious what changes would occur.

What bothered him now was that final line before the Divine Tree slept — it told him to check those two jet-black stones.

Yang Kai suddenly recalled that it had been a very long time since he’d paid any attention to those odd Jet-Black Spheres. Ever since he spent a fortune in Saint Crystals on Shuiyue Star to buy countless rare ores as nourishment for them, he’d completely forgotten about those two stones.

He immediately immersed his mind and searched within the Demon God's Secret Codex.

At a glance, Yang Kai was stunned dumb.

That mountain-like pile of rare ore had now entirely vanished; the essences from the ores had clearly been fully absorbed by the two Jet-Black Spheres, leaving only some impurities piled where they once lay. From among those impurities, a distinct vitality pulsed forth — Yang Kai could even hear, with keen regularity, a vigorous heartbeat.

What was going on?

Yang Kai brushed aside the impurities and immediately saw the two Jet-Black Spheres. They looked somewhat different now; both radiated vigorous life, yet only one of them gave off a heartbeat.

"Is this thing alive?" Yang Kai could hardly believe it. He hastily retrieved both Jet-Black Spheres and placed them before him.

Examining them more closely, he was soon shocked.

The Jet-Black Sphere that gave the heartbeat was slowly writhing within, as if some living creature were wrapped inside. The sphere’s surface bore clear, intricate vein-like patterns, tangled like a human’s meridians.

It looked like a pregnant belly, bulging and taut. And within that belly a new life was being nurtured!

The other sphere was not like this; it lacked any heartbeat, though its life-force was equally dense.

Yang Kai stared blankly, unsure what to do.

Although he had possessed the two Jet-Black Spheres for many years, their secrets remained completely unknown to him.

He immediately remembered what Ghost Ancestor had told him on the Floating Continent.

"Nurture them well; one day you’ll be in for a surprise."

Ghost Ancestor was an expert of the Void King Realm and had lived two thousand years. Worldly-wise, he clearly knew what these Jet-Black Spheres were, but at the time their relationship had been strained and Yang Kai hadn’t asked, and Ghost Ancestor hadn’t volunteered the information. So even now Yang Kai was still in the dark.

The two Jet-Black Spheres had been brought from Tongxuan Continent. If Ghost Ancestor recognized them, that meant they should’ve originated in the Starry Sky. Why they ended up on Tongxuan Continent was unknown. Could this be the moment of surprise?

Yang Kai sat cross-legged and circulated his cultivation, his mind split between watching Yang Flame’s progress and observing the two Jet-Black Spheres.

Time flew. More than ten days passed.

The two Jet-Black Spheres showed little change, and Yang Kai grew impatient. He desperately wanted to know what lay hidden inside these stones — whether there truly was a living being within.

After thinking it over, Yang Kai carefully squeezed out a drop of Golden Blood and let it fall onto the sphere that had been producing the heartbeat.

Since his Golden Blood contained such enormous life-force and vitality that it could put the Divine Tree into a sleeping evolutionary state, it ought to affect the Jet-Black Spheres as well.

The moment the Golden Blood dropped in, the heartbeat from within the Jet-Black Sphere grew far stronger. The Golden Blood seeped in and made the whole sphere glow with fierce golden light.

Some obvious changes appeared on the sphere; the vein-like lines on its surface pulsed, as if something inside was about to break the shell.

Yang Kai watched without blinking, unwilling to miss the slightest thing.

Crack—

A crisp sound rang out, and Yang Kai shuddered, feeling nervous.

A small fissure formed on the Jet-Black Sphere, and quickly widened, spreading rapidly; in the blink of an eye the whole sphere split open, revealing what had been wrapped inside.

What Yang Kai saw left him speechless in an instant!

Although he had had some suspicions, he was still dumbfounded when witnessing the scene.

There really was a living thing inside the Jet-Black Sphere! It was an egg, madly absorbing mineral essences. After nurturing it for so many years and spending countless rare ores, he had finally raised whatever was inside until it broke the shell.

Now, a gray thing sat before Yang Kai. It looked like a stone carving, its whole body exuding an ancient, simple hue. It had four limbs and a head, and its face bore clear features.

It was plainly a stone man, a palm-sized stone man!

As Yang Kai stared, it slowly stood, looking strained and wobbly, swaying as if it might fall.

Yang Kai’s reflexes were quick; he hurriedly steadied it.

Its arms were oddly long, nearly dragging on the ground; its back was slightly hunched, legs bent. Its body was composed of piece upon piece of delicate stone, with distinct edges and layers. Although it had facial features, it looked simple-minded; its clumsy movements made it appear utterly foolish.

Yang Kai was dumbstruck.

It looked around bewilderedly, and when its gray eyes fell upon Yang Kai they paused for a moment.

Because it had absorbed a drop of Yang Kai’s Golden Blood, it seemed very curious about him; like the Divine Tree, Yang Kai felt an inseparable connection with it.

After looking at him briefly, it no longer paid attention to Yang Kai. Instead it reached out its long arms, picked up the jet-black shell on the ground, and put it into its mouth to chew.

Watching it eat with relish, the shell crunching loudly, Yang Kai couldn’t help but groan inwardly.

What on earth was this thing?

Yang Kai had never tried biting that jet-black shell himself, but he knew it was incredibly hard. Having absorbed years of mineral essences, after so long a sedimentation it was comparable to, maybe even stronger than, an Origin-Grade defensive Secret Treasure in terms of toughness.

Yet in this little stone man’s mouth the jet-black shell crumbled like tofu.

Before long the pieces of jet-black shell were eaten clean with nothing left. After consuming the shell, the little stone man looked somewhat exhausted and staggered toward Yang Kai, climbing up along his thigh.

Curious about its abilities, Yang Kai reached out and flicked its forehead.

The little stone man immediately turned into a tumbling gourd and rolled away a great distance.

Yang Kai’s face darkened — after nurturing it so many years and spending so many ores, he had produced something that seemed so fragile? It was hard, but apparently rather vulnerable.

The little stone man got up, shook its head, and again walked toward Yang Kai. After much effort it reached him and continued to climb up his thigh.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh and cry; this time he didn’t flick it and let it climb up onto him.

It was not picky; it simply lay on its back on Yang Kai and closed its eyes, falling into sleep.

Yang Kai watched and shook his head in a sigh. He did not despise the little fellow for being useless; it merely differed from what he had originally expected. He had intended to cultivate those two Jet-Black Spheres into two top-quality ores, planning to use them at the right time to forge an Origin-Grade defensive Secret Treasure, but who would’ve thought a stone man would pop out.

He felt somewhat disappointed.

As he watched, Yang Kai suddenly froze, his gaze fixed on the little stone man’s chest, where a dim dark-red glow faintly flickered.

He immediately sent his mind into the Demon God's Secret Codex to search carefully.

A moment later, Yang Kai withdrew his mind, his expression strange.

He finally understood why the two Jet-Black Spheres were different — it was because of the Blood Essence Stone!

The Blood Essence Stone Yang Kai had placed within the Demon God's Secret Codex now sat at the little stone man’s chest, seemingly serving as its heart.

Yang Kai only had one Blood Essence Stone, and now it had been occupied by this little stone man, which explained why the other Jet-Black Sphere did not pulse with a heartbeat.

Yang Kai was certain that the other Jet-Black Sphere also contained a little stone man, but without a Blood Essence Stone to serve as its heart, it could not hatch.

Was there a connection between the Blood Essence Stone and this thing? Yang Kai became more puzzled and could not make sense of it for a time.

Yang Flame was still forging that Origin-Grade defensive Secret Treasure and seemed to have reached a critical stage; the energy fluctuations coming from the cave were much stronger than before. Yang Kai stood guard outside and dared not disturb it, though he was not bored now.

Since the little stone man’s appearance, he had been studying its secrets.

Several days passed and the little fellow showed no sign of growing. It was extremely interested in the direction of Yang Flame; whenever Yang Kai let his guard down it would try to run toward it, as if something there attracted it. Yang Kai had no choice but to order it not to approach the cave.

From days of observation, Yang Kai discovered an issue: though the little stone man bore signs of life and could be considered a living being, it possessed little cognition. It wasn’t like the Divine Tree; its intelligence was very low, acting mostly by instinct and by Yang Kai’s commands.
