## Chapter 2090 — Hua Qingsi

Earlier, while defending the city wall alongside Yang Kai, Qin Chaoyang personally witnessed him unleash a supreme Spatial Secret Art: with a single move, he opened a black hole that swallowed countless monsters.

Thus he concluded that Yang Kai was well versed in Spatial Power.

Qin Chaoyang did not know exactly how strong a martial artist proficient in Spatial Power could be; he only knew one thing: such fighters had an innate advantage in fleeing and in pursuit, something ordinary people could not match.

He believed that with Yang Kai's attainments in Spatial Power, if Yang Kai wished to leave Fenglin City it would not be difficult.

Handing over the complete Black Tortoise Seven-Segment Formation to him in exchange for a promise to protect Qin Yu was a fair bargain.

"Fine!"

Yang Kai nodded in agreement, glanced at Qin Yu standing to one side and said, "If I do not die, Qin Yu will certainly be unharmed!"

He had that confidence—after all, he possessed the Xuan Realm Pearl as a trump card.

Qin Chaoyang laughed with delight. "With your words, Qin can rest assured. You should calmly remain here and study the formation method; this old man will take charge of defending the city walls."

Yang Kai nodded, immediately found a slightly quieter spot nearby, sat cross-legged, let his mind sink into the jade slip, and began to study it carefully.

Time passed.

Yang Kai became thoroughly absorbed in the mysteries of the Black Tortoise Seven-Segment Formation.

He found Qin Yu had not been wrong—although this set of formations had been pieced together by the Qin family's ancestors and was not the original, it was easy to grasp and produced results quickly; he soon gained some comprehension.

He had done little deep study of formation principles. Yet the Black Tortoise Seven-Segment Formation differed from ordinary defensive or offensive layouts—it was based on martial artists as its foundation and cast in cooperation; a complete Black Tortoise Seven-Segment Formation could even reproduce part of the Divine Spirit Black Tortoise's might.

Elsewhere, Dao Origin Realm experts continued to arrive in bursts, each receiving a jade slip from Qin Yu and then seeking a place to study.

What Qin Yu handed them was not the complete array method; each received one-seventh.

A day later, Yang Kai's expression suddenly changed. He took out his Transmission Compass, poured his Divine Sense into it, and instantly detected a message coming through.

It was plainly the mental summons from City Lord Duan Yuanshan gathering people together.

Yang Kai looked up and glanced at Qin Chaoyang, who nodded slightly at him.

At the same time, a corpulent, bloated figure dropped down from the sky. A large green gourd hung at his waist—if it wasn't the Drunken Old Man, who else could it be?

The Drunken Old Man stood upon the city wall and waved to Qin Chaoyang, saying, "Go."

Qin Chaoyang smiled and said, "Then the city walls will be left in the care of the Deputy City Lord."

The Drunken Old Man glanced at him and said, "Old man, be careful when you go out; don't die out there."

Qin Chaoyang's mouth twitched, but he said nothing more; he exchanged a look with Yang Kai, took Qin Yu, and hurried off toward the gathering place.

Shortly, the two of them landed at a spot in the city.

At that time there were already four people gathered there, all Dao Origin Realm experts.

Among the four were Fenglin City's City Lord Duan Yuanshan and Deputy City Lord Zhuang Pan, while the other two were unfamiliar to Yang Kai.

One was an elderly man with a pale face and no whiskers, the other a voluptuous beauty.

Yang Kai's gaze skimmed over and, to his surprise, settled on the beauty—she was, unexpectedly, a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, a notch above Duan Yuanshan. Her aura was tightly reined in, her inner power flashing and hiding like dim embers, making her utterly inscrutable.

Since when had Fenglin City become home to so many Third-Stage Dao Origin Realm experts?

Yang Kai was greatly puzzled; a couple of days earlier he had seen a male expert of this level at the gate of the Spiritual Pill shop, and now here was another.

He did not know where these two had come from, but they were definitely not local martial artists.

Seeing Yang Kai look toward her, the beauty smiled charmingly, her entire mien seductive; her peach-blossom eyes seemed to speak, emitting soul-stealing radiance.

Yang Kai's caution spiked, and he quietly averted his gaze.

"Brother Yang, Brother Qin, you have arrived," Duan Yuanshan said, clasping his fist in salute.

Deputy City Lord Zhuang Pan snorted coldly; he clearly held a grudge against Yang Kai and did not welcome him.

Yang Kai paid him no mind — the last time at the City Lord's mansion they had had an unpleasant quarrel and even come to blows, damaging Zhuang Pan's Secret Treasure's spirit; it was natural Zhuang Pan would not give him a friendly face now.

"City Lord Duan, who is this lady...?" Qin Chaoyang landed and asked, puzzled as he looked at the beauty.

The formation-method secrets for the Black Tortoise Seven-Segment Formation had all been given by Qin Yu to these Dao Origin Realm experts; Qin Chaoyang had not been involved, so he had not met this beauty and knew that Fenglin City could not possibly have a Third-Stage Dao Origin Realm expert, hence his question.

"I am Hua Qingsi—my respects to you both," the beauty said, speaking up before Duan Yuanshan could introduce her.

"So this is Lady Hua," Qin Chaoyang frowned, a trace of strangeness passing through his eyes — she had only given a name without explanation, and he could not judge whether it was true or false.

Duan Yuanshan smiled. "Lady Hua is not a martial artist from Fenglin City; she happened to be doing business in Fenglin City before the Demonic Qi besieged the walls. Hearing we were going out to repair the seal, she volunteered to help; Lady Hua's righteousness is appreciated by Duan."

Hua Qingsi covered her mouth and laughed sweetly. "City Lord Duan is too polite. Now that Fenglin City suffers, we all suffer; I merely seek to protect myself, I cannot claim any great righteousness."

The pale, whiskerless elder then stepped forward as if much interested in Yang Kai and introduced himself. "You must be Brother Yang; I am Du Lishen, we have had a brief exchange before."

"Ah — Elder Du. Pleased to meet you," Yang Kai replied calmly, offering a light salute.

Yang Kai knew of Du Lishen — he was the Du family's elder of Fenglin City and, like Qin Chaoyang, a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm; although they had never met face to face, they had used their Transmission Compasses to exchange brief messages while jointly defending Fenglin City, so he was not a complete stranger.

Qin Chaoyang, seeing Du Lishen trying to curry favor with Yang Kai, quickly changed the subject. "City Lord Duan, there's still one person missing — you wouldn't be intending to have Yu take one of the seven places, would you? Yu is only here to repair the seal."

There had originally been four Dao Origin Realm experts gathered; with him and Yang Kai it would only make six.

Duan Yuanshan smiled, "Wait a bit longer, that person should arrive soon."

As he spoke, a streak of light shot rapidly toward them from afar; judging by its direction, it seemed to come from the City Lord's mansion.

In a moment the light flashed and a figure emerged above the group.

Yang Kai looked up and unconsciously frowned.

He realized the last arrival was the middle-aged man he had run into a few days earlier at the gate of the Spiritual Pill shop, a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

The man scanned down with his gaze, paused slightly on Yang Kai, and said indifferently, "This Lord has arrived late."

His brazen manner put the others ill at ease, though none dared show displeasure given his formidable cultivation.

Only Hua Qingsi pressed her lips together and let out a soft laugh, her expression bright and lively.

The middle-aged man's gaze turned cold; his eyes fixed on Hua Qingsi, but upon discovering her cultivation matched his own he revealed a strange expression — he had not expected that in small Fenglin City there would be another Third-Stage expert besides himself.

For a moment he could not discern Hua Qingsi's true background and could only snort coldly.

"Brother Fu's arrival is well timed," Duan Yuanshan said with a laugh, evidently uneasy at two people present who surpassed his own strength.

The crucial point was that both of them had come of their own accord to offer their strength in mending the seal—Duan Yuanshan couldn't very well refuse them.

"City Lord, once we leave Fenglin City's defenses will be greatly weakened; will those remaining be all right?" Qin Chaoyang asked with concern, for the Qin family's foundations remained within Fenglin City and the losses would be great if the city fell.

"With the Drunken Old Man and other family elders here, short-term defense should be fine, but we must hurry," Duan Yuanshan said in a deep voice. "Since everyone is present, let's set out."

With that he waved and led the way, charging outward.

The others hurried to catch up.

People were already waiting at the city wall.

"Form the array!" Duan Yuanshan's eyes grew deep as he stared at the rolling Demonic Qi and the monsters streaming about, and he barked the order.

The Formation Masters beside him immediately manipulated their Formation Plates.

The impregnable defensive array, under their control, slowly cracked an opening.

When the breach was wide enough for a single person to pass, Duan Yuanshan charged through first and shouted, "Move!"

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

All present were Dao Origin Realm experts and timed their moves precisely; in an instant, streaks of light flashed and the seven had already burst out beyond the city.

Qin Yu followed closely beside Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang, not daring to stray a step.

Once the eight had left, the Formation Masters hurriedly closed the defensive array again.

Outside the city, Demonic Qi churned; gale winds shrieked in their ears, and faint, mournful wails—like ghosts and wolves—echoed, sending chills down the spine as Qi and blood surged.

Qin Yu's face grew slightly pale and her delicate body trembled.

Even with the combined protection of Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang, for her to venture so deep into such peril with only the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivation was almost too much.

"Form the array!" Duan Yuanshan roared ahead.

In the next instant they scattered to different positions and each made continuous hand-seal formations.

As their seals shifted, an indescribable connection gradually linked the seven Dao Origin Realm experts together.

Their external Origin Qi churned and spread, fusing outward in all directions; an extraordinary aura was born out of nothing and suddenly radiated, driving away all Demonic Qi and creating, for a short time, a blank safe zone where the seven stood.
