## Chapter 1425 — Subjugation

The stalemate dragged on for a full three days and three nights, yet Yang Kai made no progress.

Instead, his Divine Sense had been completely exhausted; his Sea of Consciousness had run dry. If not for an extraordinary treasure like the Warm Spirit Lotus nurturing his spirit, the current state alone would have doomed him beyond salvage.

His whole head felt as if a thousand needles were piercing it, the pain ready to split him apart.

Inside the side chamber of Tianyi Palace, Yang Kai let out a low, muffled roar — the World-Ending Demon Eye collapsed of its own accord. Without Divine Sense as its wellspring, the World-Ending Demon Eye could not be used at all.

This was the first time the World-Ending Demon Eye had produced not the slightest result! Whenever he had called upon it before it had always been invincible; whether in battle or for intimidation, it had been supremely effective.

Yet now, against the lingering remnant soul inside the Dragon Bone Dripping Jade sword, it had no effect.

Yang Kai did not grow angry; on the contrary, he brightened with joy.

The harder it was to subdue, the greater the sword’s value. If he could find a way to make the dragon soul submit, it would grant him tremendous aid.

How to make it bow? Panting heavily, Yang Kai stared at the emerald dragon before him and thought hard in the depths of his mind.

Suddenly, as if struck by a recollection, his brows rose and a flicker of excitement crossed his eyes. His expression wavered. Though it was only a vague notion, it was absolutely worth a try.

They say those involved are often blinded; Yang Kai had entirely forgotten that there was a remnant true dragon soul within his own body!

It was the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance obtained within the forbidden Dragon Valley of Dragon-Phoenix Palace on Tongxuan Continent; ever since receiving that inheritance a golden dragon pattern had appeared on his body.

In the past Yang Kai had little experience and did not recognize its worth. He did not understand the mysteries of the golden dragon pattern, but after the last exploration of the Imperial Garden with Fei Zhi Tu and the others, he learned of the existence of Ancient Divine Spirits.

Since the inheritance drawn from the Phoenix Nest was but a remnant of the Phoenix Empress — an Ice Phoenix soul — then the Dragon Emperor inheritance he obtained in Dragon Valley must likewise be a remnant.

Though unproven, Yang Kai felt his guess was likely correct; there was no reason the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance should be inferior to the Phoenix Empress’s.

Perhaps… he could rely on the Dragon Emperor inheritance to accomplish this.

Thinking thus, Yang Kai no longer hesitated. In any case it was a method; whether it would work was left to fate.

He reached out and loosened his clothes. Taking off his upper garment, his honed torso was exposed to the air.

Yang Kai’s body did not look overly bulky, but it was perfectly proportioned; each muscle hid vast power, pleasing to the eye.

At this moment two patterns marked his skin like tattoos: one a golden dragon, the other an Ice Phoenix, each rendered with lifelike detail.

There was, however, a subtle difference: the golden dragon crawled across his skin as if alive, never stopping, while the Ice Phoenix remained fixed in a single spot, unmoving.

Ultimately, the Ice Phoenix pattern was the Phoenix Empress’s inheritance and did not belong to Yang Kai; it merely used his body as a vessel and lingered there temporarily. The golden dragon pattern, however, was the Dragon Emperor’s inheritance — it belonged to Yang Kai himself.

When Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept over the Ice Phoenix pattern, he was surprised to see its eye roll as if it had glanced at him, then fall still.

Yang Kai did not know if it had been his imagination.

Yet an image of Su Yan flashed before his eyes. After all, the Ice Phoenix pattern had been left on him to bring to Su Yan; he had not had the chance to see her again over so many years.

He wondered how she was faring now.

Whether anyone had bullied her.

Whether her cultivation was progressing smoothly.

……

After a moment of silence Yang Kai composed himself and turned his attention to the golden dragon pattern. He took a deep breath and focused his mind, then began to operate the Dual Cultivation Technique. Although Su Yan was not present to pair with him, Yang Kai was already well practiced in the method and could run it without difficulty.

Saint Yuan surged; the golden dragon pattern moved with increased rapidity as if refreshed by a nourishing stream.

A moment later, a thunderous dragon’s roar suddenly resounded, and a brilliant streak of golden light burst forth, enveloping the entire room. The emerald hue that had previously filled the chamber instantly dimmed by several shades.

The emerald giant dragon that had coldly watched Yang Kai with eyes full of scorn now panicked, as if facing a nemesis; its pupils trembled violently and fear seeped from its gaze.

A howl…

Golden light radiated from Yang Kai as the phantom of a colossal golden dragon gathered above his head, forming like a lofty deity that looked down upon the emerald wyrm.

The two dragons were nearly identical in size and shape; the only difference lay in their colors.

One gold, one green.

Though the green dragon’s expression was fearful and wary, it refused to show weakness. It lifted its head and a burst of green light flared, momentarily dimming the gold, and it met the golden dragon’s majesty with defiant dignity.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s heart leapt with joy. He knew his hunch had paid off — using dragon might against dragon might worked. He would not stop now; bracing himself, he pushed his Dual Cultivation Technique to the limit.

The golden radiance intensified and once more suppressed the green light.

But it was not over. Perhaps some hidden mechanism had been triggered, for with a crisp cry of phoenix-song the Ice Phoenix pattern that had been fixed on Yang Kai’s body transformed into a streak of light and shot forth.

Bitter cold swept out in all directions while the golden dragon radiated scorching energy. Cold and heat, which should have countered one another, instead blended; rather than clashing they bolstered each other’s might.

Gold, green, and white collided, the crackling sounds endless.

The green light, already no match for the golden radiance and suppressed, now had the white shadow join against it and was routed like a collapsing mountain.

The hissing of air and flash of brilliance filled his vision; Yang Kai could not make out shapes, only that gold and white were relentlessly pressing against the green. His Divine Sense probed and found the green light shrinking at an astonishing rate.

Boom…

A muffled boom rang out; Yang Kai’s body shook. When he opened his eyes again and looked forward, his side chamber lay in ruin as if ravaged by a violent storm. Even Tianyi Palace’s warding had been torn.

The golden dragon pattern had somehow returned to its place on his body, still moving about with jubilant animation; the Ice Phoenix pattern was once more fixed in a spot.

It was as if everything that had just happened had been a mirage and had never truly occurred.

Yang Kai’s attention was immediately drawn to the Dragon Bone Dripping Jade sword on the ground. He reached out and gripped it; an indescribable sensation flowed through him.

If before he had merely been holding a Secret Treasure, now he felt a mental link as if the Dragon Bone Dripping Jade had become part of him, obedient to his will.

Though faint, it was wholly different from before.

With a lift of his brow Yang Kai poured his Saint Yuan inward. The emerald longsword instantly manifested as an enormous emerald dragon, but unlike before the contemptuous, disdainful look had vanished from its eyes, replaced by docility and obedience.

Yang Kai grinned, unable to contain his delight.

He had never expected that a fleeting idea would actually succeed; dragon might matched against dragon might had indeed worked.

Moreover, after that display Yang Kai sensed that the golden dragon pattern on his body might even surpass the emerald giant dragon.

Both were remnants of Ancient Divine Spirits, yet when the emerald dragon had faced the golden phantom alone it had clearly lost ground. Even without the Ice Phoenix remnant joining, Yang Kai believed subduing it would be only a matter of time.

The Ice Phoenix’s involvement had simply shortened that time greatly.

With a mere thought, the massive emerald dragon moved exactly as Yang Kai willed, soaring and dancing through the air under his precise control.

From now on, when using the Dragon Bone Dripping Jade sword he need no longer fear backlash. That hidden worry lifted, Yang Kai felt elated.

After testing for a long while in the chamber to his satisfaction, Yang Kai finally withdrew the Dragon Bone Dripping Jade into his body and continued to nurture it with his Saint Yuan. He was still too weak to unleash the treasure’s full power, and the Secret Treasure itself had not yet been fully assimilated. Yang Kai could not predict just how mighty the Dripping Jade would become once all conditions matured.

It was something well worth anticipating.

He withdrew some pills from his Spatial Ring and swallowed them, reined in his spirit, sat cross-legged, and began to recover his consumed Saint Yuan and Divine Sense.

In only a single day his vigor returned to its peak. Just as Yang Kai prepared to rise, a tremendous buzzing sounded outside, and then the entire Tianyi Palace began to tremble.

Yang Kai’s face changed. At first he assumed Lingxiao Sect had been attacked, but then he hesitated — Lingxiao Sect occupied the old Taixuan Sect ruins, guarded by the Three Flames Ring externally and the sect-protecting array within. Who on Dark Star had the strength to strike Lingxiao Sect from outside?

And judging from the fluctuation of the world’s Spiritual Qi, it did not seem like the reaction of an attack.

Rather, it seemed to be a change originating from within.

Frowning slightly, Yang Kai stood and pushed open the door, stepping out of Tianyi Palace. He fixed on a direction and flashed forward at incredible speed toward it.

In short order Yang Kai reached the vast square before Lingxiao Sect’s front hall.

Dozens of disciples had gathered there and all the sect’s elders were present. Everyone was gazing up at the sky, eyes fixed and unmoving, as if something in the heavens had captured their attention.

Following their gaze, Yang Kai’s expression changed. Suspended in midair was Yang Yan, her expression solemn. Her jet-black hair floated without wind as her hands turned through hand seals and pure Saint Yuan wellsprang from her body, forming streaks of light that shot into the sky.

Detecting Yang Kai’s arrival, the crowd saluted him.
