## Chapter 1889 — Inner Core Fracture

The Heaven-Shattering Moon Eye, bearing the Heaven-Shattering Moon power, and the World-Ending Demon Eye, edged with an aura of annihilation, met and clashed within that illusory space.

Surging Divine Sense energy sprayed in all directions; at Yang Kai's left eye the terrifying golden radiance was infused with Divine Sense power, almost taking on substance, coalescing into a beam of gold that thundered toward the silvery moon hanging in the sky.

The silver moon wavered slightly, seeming unstable, but in the next instant it steadied as before; from the silver moon, silver radiance scattered like countless willow branches hanging down, meeting the world-ending beam of gold.

The gold and silver lights met in midair.

Boom… boom… boom…

A series of violent explosions rang out, unceasing.

Yang Kai's body shook violently!

Although Qian Yan's location could not be seen and his condition was unknown, given such a head-on collision of eye powers driven by Divine Sense, he surely fared no better.

This clash tested far more than their control over eye-techniques—it was a contest of Divine Sense, a struggle of sheer spiritual might.

In terms of power, Yang Kai's World-Ending Demon Eye might not match Qian Yan's Heaven-Shattering Moon Eye; that did not mean the World-Ending Demon Eye was inferior in grade, but rather Yang Kai's World-Ending Demon Eye came from an inheritance and was not innate.

Qian Yan's Heaven-Shattering Moon Eye, however, had been a divine ability he possessed from birth, honed for thousands of years.

How could the World-Ending Demon Eye compare? It was a natural shortcoming.

Yet Yang Kai's Divine Sense was absolutely stronger than Qian Yan's; after all, the Warm Spirit Lotus had been nurturing his spirit for so many years, and now his Divine Sense was in no way inferior to an expert of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

With advantages on one side and disadvantages on the other, the two were surprisingly evenly matched; looking out, the gold and silver lights were locked in stalemate midair, one retreating while the other advanced, advancing and retreating in endless cycles...

Divine Sense power burst forth like a flood after a dam gave way.

Blood poured from Yang Kai's left eye, dyeing half his cheek with a dazzling golden hue, making him look both eerie and ferocious.

He suddenly felt something was amiss.

If it had been only him against Qian Yan, such an exchange would have been tolerable; it would be a matter of endurance—whoever held out to the end would win, at worst both would be grievously wounded.

But now he faced two opponents! Besides Qian Yan, there was also Xue Jiao.

Yang Kai did not expect Xue Jiao to pass up such an opportunity to ambush him.

With that thought he no longer hesitated. He drew a deep breath, his Divine Sense moved, and he poured half of his Divine Sense power into his strongest soul secret art. Shouting, "Bloom, Lotus!"

As the words fell, at his golden left eye a lotus bud abruptly appeared.

The blossom showed itself and in the blink of an eye vanished.

Oddly, the same lotus bloom appeared above that silver moon high in the sky.

The bud seemed like a bottomless pit, madly absorbing Qian Yan's Divine Sense power without limit; as it devoured the Divine Sense, the bud slowly opened.

From afar, the silver moon seemed to transform into a lotus bud, and the moment of its fullest bloom had arrived—ready to reveal its most radiant beauty.

An incredulous wail and roar erupted; the silver moon began to warp and contort, yet in no way could it free itself from the lotus's grasp.

In just three breaths the lotus had opened halfway; the moonlight that had been resisting the world-ending golden light was greatly diminished. Yang Kai's expression soured as he fiercely pressed his Divine Sense down upon it.

Boom…

With a crisp crack, the huge silver moon in midair shattered like a plate.

"Ah!" Qian Yan's howl sounded at the same moment.

The illusion that had enveloped Yang Kai was instantly dispelled, returning him to the previous scene.

Before Yang Kai could fully recover, a chill ran through him, his pores involuntarily contracted, and a deathly aura descended upon him.

"Kid, hurry and dodge!" Chi Yue's sharp, clear command reached his ears.

“Dodge? Dodge where?” Blood Jiao roared with laughter. “Chi Yue, you blocked me once—let’s see if you can stop a second strike! Stay hidden, and this brat dies for sure!”

As he spoke, a fist-sized blood-colored orb, laced with world-destroying force, slammed toward Yang Kai's chest.

That blood-colored orb contained an unimaginable violent aura and surging qi and blood power; it was none other than the Inner Core Xue Jiao had spat out earlier.

He knew Yang Kai's body was powerful and ordinary attacks might not suffice, so the instant Yang Kai was trapped by Qian Yan's Heaven-Shattering Moon Eye, he unleashed the Inner Core at him.

A yao's Inner Core was more destructive than a Secret Treasure of the same rank; if it struck, even Yang Kai's robust body would likely suffer grievous injury, perhaps even mortal peril.

The Inner Core was small, yet it charged straight at Yang Kai like a mountain, moving at incredible speed.

When Yang Kai came to his senses, the Inner Core had already closed to within less than three inches of him.

The quick duel with Qian Yan had drained much of his Divine Sense; at such a critical moment he suffered a splitting headache and reeled, unable to use Spatial Force to teleport away.

Seeing the Inner Core about to strike, Yang Kai grit his teeth, willed his mind, and summoned an item.

A palm-sized, scale-like piece suddenly manifested, blocking his chest.

Intricate patterns covered that scale, making it look fierce and mystical, giving off a very ancient and desolate feeling.

The Inner Core arrived as expected.

Boom…

Yang Kai was blasted flying by the tremendous force; Xue Jiao, seeing this, rejoiced, eyes full of expectation to see whether Yang Kai would live or die, when suddenly an extremely brittle cracking sound reached his ears.

The sound struck Xue Jiao like a thunderclap; his face changed wildly, he involuntarily spat a spray of blood mist, and his momentum abruptly wilted.

"My Inner Core!" Xue Jiao whispered, face going pale as he looked and felt dread flood through him.

His Inner Core had developed a hairline crack; though tiny, an Inner Core was crucial to a yao, and even such a small fissure dealt Xue Jiao a grievous wound.

He felt as if he had fallen into an ice cellar, utterly unable to comprehend what method Yang Kai had used to inflict such damage.

He vaguely glimpsed something, as if a fish-scale-like thing, but could not see it clearly.

In any case, recalling the Inner Core was paramount. Xue Jiao willed it back, yet before he could do so, Yang Kai had already flashed in front of the Inner Core, reached out, and snatched it.

Xue Jiao roared, "Don't even think about it!"

He desperately drove his power, trying to summon the Inner Core back.

In an instant, that Inner Core—of an expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm—became like a living thing in Yang Kai's hand, repeatedly battering and wildly restless.

The force was so great Yang Kai almost couldn't hold it.

"Dragon Transformation!" Yang Kai growled; accompanied by a piercing dragon cry, his arm swelled, scales of Saint Yuan condensed into overlapping plates, and his hand took on the shape of a dragon's claw, the talons razor-sharp.

Roaring dragon majesty rolled outward.

Xue Jiao froze in place, dared not move, staring at Yang Kai in stupefaction; his mouth hung open as if to speak, but no words came, only shock in his eyes.

The once-restless Inner Core, at the instant the dragon might manifested, no longer dared to struggle; instead it trembled in Yang Kai's palm, as if seized by instinctive fear.

"True Dragon Origin! You actually possess True Dragon Origin!" Qian Yan exclaimed; his near-hundred eyes trembled in unison as he looked at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Their clash with Yang Kai had left him badly wounded, especially after taking a true strike of the Blooming Lotus secret art, his Divine Sense nearly drained; he had been counting on Xue Jiao to avenge him, yet he never expected Yang Kai could enhance his power further, and what Yang Kai now revealed was the True Dragon Origin that made all yao covetous.

"You, a human, actually possess the power of the True Dragon Origin?" Qian Yan's voice was strange, laced with anger, jealousy, and suspicion. "And you can wield it!"

A deep sense of helplessness welled up in Qian Yan; the more he fought Yang Kai, the less he could see where Yang Kai's limits lay.

Even with Yang Kai now drawing upon a True Dragon Origin, Qian Yan could faintly sense this still wasn’t his full strength—this man clearly held cards yet unrevealed.

"What kind of True Dragon Origin do you possess?" Qian Yan snarled, eyes narrow as he demanded.

"Do you think I'd tell you?" Yang Kai sneered, casually tossing the Inner Core in his hand; strangely, though the Inner Core had been so restless, after Yang Kai displayed the Golden Sacred Dragon origin it obeyed like a lamb, and even when tossed it did not dare to fly away.

Xue Jiao beside him was already trembling.

No wonder—the Jiao race were descendants of True Dragons and bore a trace of True Dragon blood.

What Yang Kai now displayed was not only the purest True Dragon Origin aura but the mightiest Golden Sacred Dragon Origin.

It exerted an innate, absolute suppression over Xue Jiao.

Thus Xue Jiao's performance was far worse than Qian Yan's.

Yang Kai toyed with Xue Jiao's Inner Core as he looked with relish at the two lords; his gaze made both of them feel a chill to the bone, not knowing what schemes he harbored.

In truth, Yang Kai was weighing whether to kill them outright and refine them completely into Blood Beasts, or to take their Inner Cores first and then refine them into Blood Beasts.

An Inner Core from a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert was rare and precious; without an Inner Core a Blood Beast's strength would fall greatly. But if he fully refined them into Blood Beasts he would lose their Inner Cores...

This made him hesitate, unable to decide which to choose.

Just as he wavered, a voice from within Half Moon Mountain suddenly sounded: "Kid, let them go."
