## Chapter 635 — Blazing Fire City

Three days later, the three of them arrived at Blazing Fire City.

Before they reached the city walls, Yang Kai felt a scorching air strike him in the face; even the ground beneath their horses seemed to be burning, and the mounts sweated profusely as they walked.

This kind of heat made Yang Kai feel unusually comfortable, and his mood lifted considerably.

The peculiar environment of Blazing Fire City had drawn large numbers of martial artists who cultivated fire-based skills and Martial Skill to garrison here. No one truly knew why the city exhibited such an anomaly, but those who cultivated fire methods and Martial Skill could plainly sense that training here progressed far faster than elsewhere.

It was as if the air itself held several tiers more fire Spiritual Qi than surrounding regions.

Some rumors claimed that vast subterranean magma surged beneath Blazing Fire City, creating this special terrain within a hundred li, but rumors remained rumors and none could confirm them.

When Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to probe upon arrival, he indeed detected the energy of raging flames coursing beneath the earth.

His original intention had been to escort Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu to Blazing Fire City and then leave; after all, this place also hosted a branch of the Duao Alliance, so once they reached Blazing Fire City they would be, in effect, back within the Alliance.

But the two women insisted he remain and rest for several days before setting off.

Yang Kai thought it over and agreed; his injuries still required recuperation.

After entering Blazing Fire City and reporting their identities, the city lord Ji Yan hurried out to welcome them.

Ji Yan cultivated to Transcendent Realm, First Stage, placing him on the same tier as Sun Ying; because he practiced fire methods, his strength was not insignificant, and so he served as the city lord to guard Blazing Fire City.

He was also a notable force within the Duao Alliance.

Ji Yan was a burly man. Perhaps due to training fire techniques, even his exposed skin bore a dark red hue, giving him a straightforward, exuberant appearance. He personally led people to receive Yun Xuan into the city lord's residence and arranged attendants to serve and care for her.

Upon learning of the fate that had befallen the three small squads of the Duao Alliance on their mission, Ji Yan was greatly shocked and began to question them in detail.

Ruan Xinyu and Yun Xuan seemed to have reached an understanding and did not expose Yang Kai. They merely said that a passing exalted master had struck in to help and slain that Enchantress, which allowed them to survive.

This explanation satisfied Yang Kai, and he gave the two women a grateful look.

He had been quite worried they might reveal the truth; if that had happened, regardless of whether Ji Yan would have believed it, he would certainly not have been able to leave the Duao Alliance.

Fortunately, Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu had no intention of betraying Yang Kai.

Their account was reasonable, and Ji Yan probed in detail about the supposed stranger's appearance. Yun Xuan had prepared an internal story and described it carefully; Ji Yan sighed and declared he would list this unknown master as a benefactor of the Duao Alliance and that, should he be met in the future, the Alliance must repay the debt.

"I will report this to the head Alliance at once. Miss Yun has been frightened; rest a few days in Blazing Fire City and recover your injuries. I will personally escort you back to the head Alliance," Ji Yan admonished, then hurried away.

Nearly twenty Divine Roaming Realm experts and one Transcendent Realm practitioner from the Duao Alliance had perished — such a grave matter naturally required immediate reporting.

"Satisfied now?" Ruan Xinyu snorted, looking rather displeased as she gazed at Yang Kai.

"Satisfied." Yang Kai pinched his nose. "Once my injuries recover I'll leave."

"The farther you go, the better." Ruan Xinyu made her contempt for Yang Kai plain.

Yun Xuan shook her head helplessly and lay down on the bed without a word.

Excusing himself, Yang Kai returned to his room, sat cross-legged, and while cultivating to heal his wounds he examined the benefits he had obtained from the Enchantress.

The Divine Sense energy within the Enchantress had contained a poison of the mind, but that toxin had been thoroughly purified by Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire and the Golden Pupil Eye's golden light, leaving only pure energy and the Enchantress's realm-inspired insights.

Absorbing those insights and perceptions, Yang Kai obtained some understanding of changes within his own Divine Sense.

Only now did he realize that Divine Sense was not without attributes.

When a martial artist cultivates to the Divine Roaming Realm, they open the Sea of Consciousness in their mind and refine their Divine Sense. Ordinary people's Divine Sense is generally alike, a formless, attributeless chaos, yet some, through various fates and opportunities, manage to mutate their Divine Sense.

For example, Yang Kai had absorbed the True Spirit within a jade, and his Divine Sense had become blazing hot like fire.

Others' Divine Sense might be icy as frost, swift as lightning, or fierce as a gale.

Different Divine Senses produced different effects, and such mutated Divine Sense possessed destructive and lethal power several tiers beyond that of ordinary practitioners.

Yang Kai even wondered whether his fiery Divine Sense might produce special effects if used in alchemy.

From the True Alchemy Formula he had gleaned many alchemists' insights and experiences, but none of those alchemists had possessed a fiery Divine Sense, so there were no precedents for him to reference.

Still, he vaguely felt that using Divine Sense Fire for alchemy might be more effective and convenient than using True Yuan.

The thought passed, and Yang Kai abandoned the idea for the moment; after all, he was only beginning in the art of alchemy and still had much to learn.

Once he had genuine attainments in alchemy, then considering such matters would be practical.

Lost in these reflections, time quickly passed and the wound in his lower abdomen likewise healed at an astonishing pace.

The medicinal effect of Wan Yao Ling Milk was extraordinary!

Two or three nights later, Yun Xuan stood outside Yang Kai's door with a jade hand raised, yet she hesitated and could not summon the courage to knock and enter.

Ruan Xinyu appeared beside her like a specter, grinning wickedly.

"You nearly gave me a heart attack, you little devil!" Yun Xuan blushed deeply, patted her heaving chest and shot her a reproachful glance.

"What are you going to do?" Ruan Xinyu wore an ambiguous expression, clicking her tongue. "Are you planning a night raid?"

"Don't be ridiculous." Yun Xuan's face flushed redder as memories of the recent intimate scene involuntarily came to mind, making her heart tremble.

Ruan Xinyu curled her lips and snorted, "After remaining chaste so many years, once you break your vow you can't help yourself, can you?"

"That's not true," Yun Xuan murmured. "He'll probably leave tomorrow; I just wanted—"

"Stop thinking," Ruan Xinyu cut in. "A single night of passion is worth a fortune. He's already had you once — another time won't hurt. Perhaps you'll make him fall head over heels for you and he'll stay in the Alliance." Ruan Xinyu spoke Yun Xuan's hidden thoughts aloud.

Indeed Yun Xuan had such thoughts. Though she said she didn't care whether Yang Kai stayed, toward the man who had violently taken her innocence she secretly wished he would remain by her side.

Yun Xuan had grown weary over the years and longed for a dependence, yet no one had ever met her standard.

Tonight she had come to make one last attempt; she did not expect to be confronted by Ruan Xinyu and became flustered.

Ruan Xinyu cautiously probed and found Yang Kai's aura steady within the room; he was clearly in meditation. She kept signaling to Yun Xuan that this was the perfect moment for a night raid.

Yun Xuan, like a frightened rabbit, shook her head repeatedly, her face panicked.

She could not get past the barrier in her own heart: though she had been defiled against her will, she felt no hatred; instead she felt some reluctance to part.

This realization made Yun Xuan feel somewhat ashamed of herself.

"If you don't try tonight, you'll regret it for a lifetime," Ruan Xinyu sighed softly. "Think not only of your future but of the Alliance — this man has great potential; he might become a pillar of our Alliance someday."

Saying this, Ruan Xinyu became excited and ground her teeth, "So, are you going in or not? If you won't, I will."

"What would you do?" Yun Xuan stared at her in astonishment.

"Hmph!" Ruan Xinyu toyed with the hair at her ear and took on a coquettish air, "I'm not bad-looking either. A good helper like him, if you don't want him, I'll take him. For my future, a little sacrifice is nothing. We'll all need to marry one day; he's not bad — a bit young, but mature for his age."

Yun Xuan covered her mouth in disbelief and muttered, "You're so wanton."

Ruan Xinyu flushed at the remark. "So what? Will you go in or not?"

Yun Xuan bit her thin lip and hesitated; under Ruan Xinyu's combined coaxing and coercion she wavered.

After much deliberation, she finally nodded slightly, cheeks full of shyness, and pushed open the door to walk in.

"See? If I didn't push you, you never would have decided." Ruan Xinyu beamed with satisfaction, then stilled her breath and pricked up her ears to listen for sounds from within the room.

Inside, Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, awakening from meditation. He reached out, grabbed the person who had approached and threw her onto the bed; a finger jabbed into her chest as he stared coldly.

Thinking at first that someone had come to ambush him, when he saw the face of the person beneath him Yang Kai was stunned. "You?"

Yun Xuan feigned composure though her neck flushed crimson. She dared not meet Yang Kai's gaze and turned her head to bite her red lips, saying nothing; her eyes, however, overflowed with desire, moist and alluring.

Yang Kai was taken aback and, after a moment's thought, cried out in alarm, "You can't be serious?"

Yun Xuan's utterly compliant, offering manner made Yang Kai realize the gravity of the situation at once.

"So what if I am?" Yun Xuan suddenly grew bold, flipped over and pressed Yang Kai down. Her hands planted on his chest as she sat astride him, her hips coyly raised; her eyes shone and her face burned as she panted, teeth clenched, "Last time the Enchantress's Divine Sense affected me so I felt nothing — this time... this time—"

She could not finish the sentence, letting out a soft whimper and covering her face with both hands.

Yang Kai looked at her with burning eyes, swallowed hard, and his breathing grew heavier.

"But your wound—" he began.

"It's nearly healed. I don't know why, but this time the recovery was especially quick." Yun Xuan explained as she slowly lifted her clothes, shyly adding, "If you don't believe me, see for yourself..."

A breathtaking patch of pure white met Yang Kai's eyes.

"Enough. You came to me of your own accord." Yang Kai roared in anger, flipped over and once more pinned Yun Xuan beneath him as he bellowed.
