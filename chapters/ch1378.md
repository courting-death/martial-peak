## Chapter 1378 — Fell Into a Pit

"Golden Lion Thunder-pattern Beast!" Elder Jin Shi of the Demon Blood Sect cried out in alarm, a trace of apprehension faintly lacing his voice.

Many experts in the other annex rooms frowned as well; it seemed this Golden Lion Thunder-pattern Beast had quite a reputation.

"Qing'er, where does this Elder Feng hail from? And what tier is the Golden Lion Thunder-pattern Beast — do you know?" Yang Kai asked the girl standing with her head bowed beside him.

Qing'er pursed her lips and smiled softly. "To answer Elder's question, this Elder Feng is an elder from Myriad Beasts Mountain. That Golden Lion Thunder-pattern Beast is the life-bonded demonic beast of Elder Feng. It is said to be an ancient aberrant species, a Ninth-Tier demonic beast. In terms of strength it is roughly equivalent to a practitioner at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Elder Feng is of that cultivation as well, but if the two fight together to repel an enemy, they should not be weaker than those at the Third Stage."

"Myriad Beasts Mountain?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. He had long known there was a force on Dark Star that commanded and enslaved demonic beasts — it was Myriad Beasts Mountain. Back in the Flowing Flame Sandland he had crossed paths with disciples from Myriad Beasts Mountain; that sect seemed to be situated near the Liuli Sect, and the two powers often clashed.

As for the life-bonded demonic beast Qing'er mentioned, Yang Kai had heard of it too. Myriad Beasts Mountain's cultivation method differed from other warriors: each disciple had their own life-bonded demonic beast, and their personal strength rose together with the beast. If the beast advanced, the owner would gain great benefit and might even break through their own bottleneck.

According to Qing'er, this Elder Feng had already reached the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. If her Golden Lion Thunder-pattern Beast received the aid of Xuan Gold, its strength could surge dramatically, and as its owner she could break through to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

By then, one person and one beast fighting together would likely make even ordinary Third Stage practitioners no match for them.

Realizing this, Yang Kai immediately understood why this Old Woman Feng and Jin Shi were fighting over that Xuan Gold, and felt a headache coming on. Whether it was Old Woman Feng or Jin Shi, both desperately needed the Xuan Gold; to make them give up, one could only overwhelm them with wealth.

“Ren boy, it seems your Jubao Tower not only gathers the world’s treasures—since when did you also start prying into and spreading people’s affairs?” Old Woman Feng’s voice carried a trace of irritation, clearly because Ren Tianrui had just exposed the reason she needed the Xuan Gold.

Ren Tianrui on the high platform gave a dry laugh and dared not say more.

"Hmph, even so, I will not give up lightly. Your beast needs the Xuan Gold, but I need it more — forty-two million!"

Before Old Woman Feng could raise the price further, a chuckling, seductive voice came from another annex: "I'll join the fun too — forty-three million!"

Yang Kai's expression flickered; then the corner of his mouth lifted into an odd smile.

It was no surprise — he recognized the voice. The bidder was Yin Sudie of the Liuli Sect. Her presence here was not odd; Daiyuan had once told Yang Kai when she visited Dragon Lair Mountain that Yin Sudie led Liuli Sect's surveillance of Imperial Garden movements.

But for her to bid now meant she was likely acting under orders from her sect elders; Liuli Sect and Myriad Beasts Mountain had long been at odds, and they would not sit idly by while Old Woman Feng took the Xuan Gold and surged in power.

A perfect opportunity!

Yang Kai had been considering when to bid without drawing attention; Yin Sudie's bid solved that for him, and without hesitation he followed: "Fifty million!"

The auction hall erupted. In the annex, Qing'er's beautiful eyes brightened as she looked toward Yang Kai, seemingly surprised at the depth of his wealth.

Two unfamiliar voices joining the bidding made the already tense atmosphere feel even more strange.

“Good, good, good!” Old Woman Feng ground her teeth and gave a cold snort. “How amusing—any random cat or dog dares to fight this old woman over something now. Aren’t you afraid you’ll have the money to buy it, but no life left to claim it?”

Her tone was thick with menace. Ren Tianrui on the platform's face turned grim, icy and severe.

Jubao Tower had held countless auctions. Although battles over auctioned items often erupted and sometimes even led to deaths, no one had dared to make such threats in public like this.

Such words were an affront to Jubao Tower's dignity and credibility. Ren Tianrui's face sank as he said, "Elder Feng, these words I wish to hear only once in Jubao Tower. If there is a next time, Myriad Beasts Mountain will be listed as an unwelcome sect. I ask you to consider this."

Though Ren Tianrui's cultivation was not high, at that moment he represented Jubao Tower, so his words carried weight.

Old Woman Feng seemed to realize her remark had been improper. She chuckled hoarsely and said, "Nephew Ren, no need to be so tense. I was only joking — auctions are mutual affairs after all."

“Is that so.” A gentle smile suddenly bloomed on Ren Tianrui’s face as he lightly flicked open his folding fan and said slowly, “Then it seems this junior has overstepped—please forgive the offense, Elder Feng. So then, would Elder still like to raise the bid on this piece of Xuan Gold?”

"Naturally — fifty-one million!"

"Sixty million!" Yang Kai answered without hesitation, not even frowning. His primary purpose on this trip was that Xuan Gold; he would not miss it. Even if it meant spending his entire fortune, he would buy it. Seeing others still bid at this price, he wanted to display his wealth to drive them off, so each of his raises jumped considerably.

The Myriad Beasts Mountain annex fell silent; the price seemed to have surpassed Old Woman Feng's acceptable limit. After all, Xuan Gold was precious, but sixty million Saint Crystals was no small sum.

Elder Jin Shi of the Demon Blood Sect pondered a moment before saying, "Sixty million and one hundred thousand; if a higher price appears, I shall withdraw."

Sixty million had reached Jin Shi's limit.

From room B-13, Yang Kai chuckled and replied leisurely, "Sixty million and two hundred thousand!"

He had only added one hundred thousand to the previous bid.

“Good, good, good!” Jin Shi said three times in succession—no one could discern what emotion lay behind his words. But sure enough, he made no further bids, allowing Yang Kai to finally breathe a sigh of relief, secretly feeling that this piece of Xuan Gold was as good as in his pocket.

Jubao Tower seemed pleased as well. Ren Tianrui's face brightened; he looked toward room B-13 and loudly called out, "Is there anyone who will raise? If not, I will begin the countdown. Sixty million and two hundred thousand once, sixty million and two hundred thousand twice..."

“Sixty-one million!” Just as Yang Kai was brimming with confidence and about to have the young girl Qing’er go and receive the Xuan Gold, an abrupt voice suddenly rang out from within the hall.

Yang Kai's expression flickered; following the voice he gritted his teeth.

He realized the voice at the crucial moment was not some random person — it was Lu Ye of Liu Yun Valley!

Lu Ye had been the center of attention at this auction, extravagantly buying several items in the hall and spending tens of millions of Saint Crystals.

Such spending was not something a small sect's cultivator could afford. Many had started to notice him, but instead of hiding his brilliance he flaunted it, and now, at the last moment, he ostentatiously struck again — utterly against the norm.

But with the price refreshed, Yang Kai refused to back down. He gritted his teeth and wagered all his possessions: "Seventy million!"

Ren Tianrui on the platform raised an eyebrow and cast inquiring looks at Lu Ye, seemingly expecting him to bid again. Disappointingly, Lu Ye only shouted a figure once and fell silent, then looked up and grinned in Yang Kai's direction, a smile full of smugness and mockery.

Damn it! Realizing Lu Ye knew he was here, Yang Kai's face darkened; he had been tricked.

If he hadn’t placed a bid just now, that Lu Ye would likely have landed himself in enormous trouble—for he clearly didn’t possess that many Saint Crystals. He had only raised the price on purpose, knowing Yang Kai was present. Yet unexpectedly, Yang Kai had failed to notice the ploy in time and had fallen right into the trap.

Understanding this made Yang Kai's mood sour, as if he'd swallowed a fly.

He was not fussed about the extra Saint Crystals spent, but about missing the chance to drag Lu Ye into ruin — it was a pity. Jubao Tower had rules: if a bidder maliciously bid without the means, an investigation would follow, and the offender would be hunted down relentlessly.

Such a heavenly opportunity had been missed, and Yang Kai's expression became extremely displeased.

But soon he smiled again and calmed himself. One who walks near the river will get his shoes wet; fortunes shift. Let's wait and see!

With no one else raising, and after Ren Tianrui counted down three times, the Xuan Gold was declared sold to Yang Kai for seventy million.

Yang Kai took out a Spatial Ring and handed it to Qing'er, instructing her to go to Jubao Tower's rear hall to receive the item. Qing'er accepted the order.

In that moment another auction item was brought up: an egg of a Ninth-Tier demonic beast, also an ancient aberrant species like Old Woman Feng's Golden Lion Thunder-pattern Beast. Though not as precious, it was still excellent.

Such a treasure naturally stirred fierce bidding, especially from Myriad Beasts Mountain, which spared no effort.

After all, a Ninth-Tier demonic beast egg, if properly raised, could later provide a helper equivalent to a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioner.

The beast egg was ultimately seized by Myriad Beasts Mountain for a price of a little over thirty-six million — a result that left all satisfied. Several finale items were then presented one after another, each fought over by multitudes; final prices rose several times to over ten times the starting bids, leaving the hall's cultivators whispering in awe.
