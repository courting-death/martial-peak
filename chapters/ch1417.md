## Chapter 1417 — Absolute Strength Crushes All Technique

That blinding radiance flashed only once, then seemed to be blasted out by some force; immediately a cracking sound followed as the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator's fairly high-grade Secret Treasure long sword came into contact with the pitch-black staff and shattered in an instant, brittle beyond belief.

“How is this possible!” the man’s eyes trembled violently. His Secret Treasure was at least Origin-Grade; though famed for its sharpness and elegance rather than toughness, it still shouldn't have been destroyed so easily.

That Secret Treasure had accompanied him for decades, slain countless foes, nurtured by his Saint Yuan and Divine Sense—truly the piece he relied upon most.

He never expected it to be ruined here.

Pain shot through him and horror flickered in his eyes. That pitch-black staff must conceal some terrifying power to casually destroy his long sword like that; if it had struck him directly, how could he possibly have survived?

With that thought, a trace of resolve crossed his eyes. He bit his tongue, spat a spray of blood mist, and scrambled backward to avoid the staff’s sweep.

His plan was sound, but he had gravely underestimated the black staff’s strangeness.

That pitch-black staff was undoubtedly the Heaven-Shaking Pillar Yang Kai had brought from the Imperial Garden. As Yang Yan had said, the staff was forged from Heaven-Crystal Darksteel, a Void King-Grade refining material, astonishingly heavy—palm-sized chunks weighed tens of thousands of jin—and nearly indestructible; few means in the world could damage it.

Even Yang Kai himself could barely wield the Heaven-Shaking Pillar.

Somehow it had been tempered to change size at will. When the puppet in the Imperial Garden used the Heaven-Shaking Pillar, it had once reached over ten zhang in length. Eventually it had been given to the Stone Puppet, who swallowed it into its belly.

Now the Stone Puppet had drawn it to repel foes, shortening the Heaven-Shaking Pillar to no more than one zhang to suit its body, but that did not mean it could not be larger.

Seeing the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator spray blood mist and attempt to move out of range, the Stone Puppet’s round eyes flashed and the Heaven-Shaking Pillar in its hand suddenly lengthened out of thin air, enclosing the enemy again before sweeping with unabated force.

This change left the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator looking hopeless; in desperation he poured all his Saint Yuan into a protective barrier around his flesh.

Crack...

A light sound rang out as the Heaven-Shaking Pillar struck the man’s body; the dazzling protective Saint Yuan burst like a bubble. His body twisted in an unbelievable way, the sickening snaps of breaking bones making heads crawl.

Blood spurted from his mouth along with bits of entrails. The man was sent flying like an arrow loosed from a bow by the sweep of the Heaven-Shaking Pillar.

One strike and he was grievously wounded. He was not dead, but the injuries were severe.

Had he faced only the Stone Puppet, he might have had a chance to escape, but Yang Kai would not miss the opportunity to beat a fallen dog; golden blood threads shot forth, transforming into a rain of golden light that enshrouded the man.

Whooshing sounds pierced the air. The sky filled with an eruption of blood mist.

Hanging in midair, the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator's life force vanished!

In the blink of an eye, a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior died on the spot in a hideous state, causing everyone present to change faces, stricken with shock and anger.

In truth, the scene just now wasn’t extraordinarily perilous; it was simply the Battle Sky Alliance cultivator’s ill fortune to meet the Stone Puppet wielding a size-changing Heaven-Shaking Pillar, struck unexpectedly with no defense. That was the main cause of his sudden fall—had he known beforehand, he wouldn’t have been so careless.

But now words were futile.

After slaying the foe, the Stone Puppet let out a beastlike roar; its small frame swelled rapidly, in a blink becoming a three to four zhang-tall stone colossus, and the Heaven-Shaking Pillar in its hand lengthened accordingly.

Boom, boom, boom...

The transformed Stone Puppet strode forward with huge steps, full of momentum.

A three-to-four-zhang stone giant wielding the Heaven-Shaking Pillar is a force even Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts would temporarily avoid. Each sweep seemed to solidify the very space; those entangled by the Divine Tree and unable to break free were out of luck, shrieking as they desperately used yuan-draining techniques to flee the Stone Puppet’s sight.

But the Divine Tree would not let them escape so easily. Countless branches turned into a dense barrage of whips, wrapping every enemy within; any struck would inevitably be left bloodied and torn.

The Stone Puppet seized the opportunity, displaying overwhelming might; one sweep of the Heaven-Shaking Pillar after another, and every struck enemy spat blood and fell in disgrace.

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar weighed hundreds of thousands of jin, yet in its hands it was as light as nothing. Even without Saint Yuan infusion, it was an incredible killing tool—only Void King Realm experts could resist it; Origin Returning Realm practitioners could only dodge.

This was precisely the meaning of “absolute strength crushes all technique.” The Stone Puppet needed no mastery of secret arts—its earth-shaking power alone was enough to make heaven and earth pale.

First Stage warriors struck by it would die; the lucky ones who survived a blow could only cling to life a little longer before being finished by the Divine Tree’s glinting golden leaves.

Only experts at the Second Stage could withstand a single blow, while even those at the Third Stage dared not meet its edge head-on and hurriedly dodged in panic.

Mo Yu’s eye twitched and his lips trembled as he watched from not far away.

This Dragon Lair Mountain… just what kind of perilous den of dragons and tigers was it!

First there was the Awakened Ancient Tree, and now a Stone Giant had made its shocking appearance. In all these hundred and eighty years, he had never witnessed such marvels—today, his eyes had feasted on them all at once.

Mo Yu was no simple ignoramus; as the Great Elder of Qiantian Sect he was well-read and experienced, yet everything he saw today shook his composure.

Just these two beings—the Awakened Ancient Tree and the Stone Giant—were enough to rival an army of thousands. What’s more, that brat named Yang Kai seemed not to have made a single move yet; who knew what he was plotting.

Though Yang Kai had not yet moved, anyone who could command both an Awakened Ancient Tree and a Stone Giant could not be measured by a mere Third Stage of the Saint King Realm.

For a moment Mo Yu felt relieved that he heeded his disciple’s plea and avoided direct conflict with Dragon Lair Mountain; had he not, Qiantian Sect would have only suffered harm.

The Awakened Ancient Tree was formidable, but rooted and unwieldy—excellent as a defensive bulwark but less suited for attack.

The stone giant, however, was terrifying. On Dark Star, who could fight such a monster? Even Third Stage Origin Returning Realm experts were inadequate—only a massive concerted assault might have a chance to topple it.

He had helped that brat just now; Yang Kai should remember. Mo Yu’s heart fluttered—what if Yang Kai didn’t notice his earlier favor? That would be a serious loss for him.

While the Divine Tree and Stone Puppet devastated the field, a high dragon’s roar cut through the air. The sky darkened and a terrifying pressure descended.

The pressure was so intense that everyone’s scalps tingled, as if an unseen pair of eyes watched them and any misstep would shatter them to pieces.

Though not as great as the Imperial Might during the Imperial Garden incident, this pressure was not far behind.

Everyone froze and turned toward the source of the pressure with horrified eyes.

Over on that side, Yang Kai stood proudly where he was, the Void King-Grade artifact furnace beside him spinning rapidly. In his large hand, he slowly drew out a jade-green object from within the furnace—shaped like a longsword—and as it emerged, an invisible pressure surged forth, growing ever more intense.

In an instant the jade-green, swordlike object was fully withdrawn.

It measured at most three feet, emerald and dripping with life, seeming like a sword yet strange—devoid of a blade, appearing crudely made like a piece of bone.

A dragon-eye-sized bead was set at the hilt, and within the jade-green body something like a little snake writhed happily.

The sword seemed sentient. Held by Yang Kai it hummed, eager to break free and ascend to the sky.

A vast dragon-head illusion suddenly rose from the jade-green blade, lifelike; its copper-drum-sized eyes held endless majesty. When they swept across, many experts involuntarily felt like insignificant ants.

That horrifying pressure radiated from this emerald sword.

No one dared meet the dragon-head’s gaze—only Yang Kai lifted his head thoughtfully, his World-Ending Demon Eye revealed at the left, and he met it unafraid.

An invisible shockwave centered on Yang Kai exploded outward; that horrifying Divine Sense swept like a tangible force, unsettling even Third Stage Origin Returning Realm warriors and churning their Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai also let out a muffled groan, his brow furrowing slightly. Within his World-Ending Demon Eye, the phantom of a lotus bud appeared, then eerily sank into the dragon’s head.

The Blooming Lotus secret art was Yang Kai’s most powerful soul technique.

The dragon’s cry rang out again, full of dread and pain; its dragon-eye showed anguish, then its form trembled and sank into the jade-green sword in Yang Kai’s hand, vanishing.

The humming ceased and the trembling blade calmed, no longer trying to break free. Yang Kai exhaled softly, a pensive look on his face.

This jade-green long sword was Yang Kai’s first time using it, forged from Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl.
