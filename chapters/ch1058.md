## Chapter 1058 — Zong Ao

At the pavilion nestled in those mountains, blood still seeped from Halika's severed arm; Halika, Lin Mufeng, and the middle-aged woman stood quietly outside the pavilion, waiting, their faces anxious.

Yang Kai stood not far from them, expression indifferent, motionless.

No one knew what he was thinking.

After a moment, more than a dozen people suddenly poured out from the pavilion—men and women, old and young—but without exception each wore on their chest the emblem that signified an alchemist's identity.

It was the mark of a cauldron; this emblem was standard across the Star Domain.

An alchemist's rank was distinguished by the number of feet on the cauldron.

On the emblems these alchemists wore, the cauldron with the fewest feet already had eight! That was the mark of a Saint King-Grade alchemist.

There were even two venerable elders wearing nine-foot cauldrons — a symbol of Origin-Grade alchemists!

Origin-Grade alchemists held very high status in the Hengluo Star Domain; across the Star Domain there were not many who reached Origin-Grade. One tier higher, the Void King-Grade, numbered only a handful, three to five at most, taken by the most powerful forces.

Even the mighty Hengluo Commerce Guild had only a single Void King-Grade alchemist stationed on its home world!

And the dozen or so who emerged from the pavilion were the most senior and most skilled alchemists on Rainfall Star.

Halika and Lin Mufeng had summoned these people to diagnose Xue Yue's injuries and see if they could find a way to save her.

Normally these alchemists were scattered across Rainfall Star, each holding their own territories and cultivating medicinal herbs to refine pills for the Guild to sell; the Guild provided protection and certain resources. Their relationship was cooperative rather than subordinate. Thus even Halika and Lin Mufeng treated them with courtesy and dared not show the slightest disrespect.

They would not ordinarily disturb them, but for the safety of Xue Yue — the Young Master's woman — they had still invited them to assemble.

When the dozen or so emerged, Halika and the others were jolted to attention and hurried forward. Lin Mufeng cupped his fists and asked, "Sirs, how is Lady Xue's condition? Is there a way to resolve it?"

The dozen exchanged glances, seemingly reluctant to speak.

Seeing their expressions, Halika and Lin Mufeng felt their hearts sink; they realized it was not good.

"What exactly is the situation?" Halika asked urgently.

They turned their gazes toward one of those wearing the nine-foot cauldron mark. The white-haired elder had to speak: "My lords, I'll be frank: after half an hour of investigation, the dozen of us still don't know why Lady Xue fell into a coma; we only know she was invaded by a force of icy cold. Her bodily functions have been completely frozen; she has no consciousness and cannot answer questions."

Halika listened silently.

The elder continued, "If you do not tell us what Lady Xue encountered, how can we rescue her? We do not even know what kind of pill to concoct to save her."

"Indeed, at the very least you must tell us the cause and what happened to her," another Origin-Grade alchemist agreed. "Only then can we prescribe correctly and refine a pill to wake her."

Halika's face instantly showed distress.

Profound Yin Moon Water was a matter of grave consequence — a cultivation treasure that would make anyone envious. If news leaked, it would very likely attract the covetousness of powerful experts; until they had devised a way to secure compensation, Halika dared not utter the name Profound Yin Moon Water.

But doing so would delay these dozen alchemists' diagnosis of Lady Xue. For a moment they were torn, and all eyes turned to Lin Mufeng, seeking his opinion.

Lin Mufeng gave a faint, imperceptible shake of his head.

Halika said with difficulty, "Sirs, it's not that we wish to hide anything, but this matter is too weighty; we dare not speak lightly."

From his words, the alchemists realized there were matters beyond their concern and did not press further. The elder frowned, pondered for a moment, and said, "If that's the case, please forgive us — we are powerless."

"Sirs, can't you try once more?" Halika implored. "You are the finest alchemists on Rainfall Star; if even you have no way, then Lady Xue —"

Whether Lady Xue lived or died was not of direct consequence to him. What he feared was that if Lady Xue suffered a mishap it would draw the Young Master's frenzied wrath, something he could not withstand.

The dozen alchemists all shook their heads in unison, indicating they truly were powerless.

Halika, Lin Mufeng, and the others could not help but look helpless, exchanging wry smiles.

At that moment, one Saint King-Grade alchemist said, "Lord Halika flatters us by calling us the best on Rainfall Star. But there is another man — when it comes to alchemical technique and knowledge of medicinal arts he surpasses us all. If you could persuade him to come, he might see something and perhaps find a way to resolve this."

Hearing this, the elder who had spoken earlier raised his brow, as if recalling such a person, and nodded, "Indeed, if it's him, perhaps he could."

The others immediately agreed, wholeheartedly admitting that man was Rainfall Star's premier alchemist.

Alchemists were an arrogant lot; among those of the same rank, no one would admit another was superior. They always believed themselves to be the finest of their rank and dismissed others as trash — and so were the pills they made!

If something could win unanimous praise from a dozen alchemists, there was only one explanation: that alchemist's rank exceeded theirs — he must be a Void King-Grade alchemist!

Halika and the others brightened at the thought, but soon their expressions soured. "Inviting him... is difficult, very difficult. Even if we went to pay our respects, we'd probably be driven off!"

Lin Mufeng sniffed and said, "Five years ago when I visited him, I disturbed his peace and he pursued me for half a month. It only ended when his anger subsided. I don't want to be chased by him again."

At the mention of that episode, the group couldn't help but chuckle; it seemed they were all familiar with the story.

"Who is that person?" Yang Kai asked.

Earlier, while they spoke, he had remained silent — watching Halika and Lin Mufeng conceal the truth and listening to the dozen alchemists praise that man. Only now did he speak up.

The dozen alchemists turned their gazes toward him in unison, but did not answer.

To them, Yang Kai was merely a greenhorn who had entered the Saint Realm — hardly qualified to ask questions — and they were too disdainful to reply.

Halika, however, pondered and said, "He's a formidable alchemist who lives on Rainfall Star, but he does not belong to any faction."

"He doesn't belong to the Hengluo Commerce Guild either?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

Halika shook his head.

To live on Rainfall Star yet not be under the Hengluo Commerce Guild's jurisdiction had only one explanation — the Guild dared not offend him lightly.

"However, the Guild struck certain agreements with him. We supply him with herbs for alchemy and grant him a territory of three thousand li; the pills he refines from those materials all belong to our Guild."

"Free labor?" Yang Kai's brow twitched; he did not understand the master's arrangement. If this master was so skilled, there was no need to go to the trouble of refining pills only to hand them to the Hengluo Commerce Guild for free.

He could easily found a sect, take many disciples, and raise his own standing.

"It's not quite like that," came the reply. "Although we don't know precisely what he needs, we try to meet his requirements... Still, the pills he refines are indeed numerous. Every three months we dispatch people to deliver spiritual herbs and medicines to him, and the pills he produces that we retrieve number no fewer than two hundred bottles each time, the highest reaching five hundred bottles!"

Five hundred bottles!

Each bottle contained ten pills. That was five thousand pills — five thousand refined in three months, a figure that made all the alchemists present tremble with shame.

They were hired by the Hengluo Commerce Guild at great expense, but even if they worked without sleep for three months they could not reach five hundred bottles, not even a third, unless they were producing low-grade pills.

"Where is he?" Yang Kai asked again.

"Young Brother wants to go find him?" Halika immediately perceived his intent.

"It's the only thing we can do now, right?" Yang Kai glanced at him.

Halika pondered, then nodded, "Alright, I'll take you there!"

Though he had a hundred reasons not to, in the end Halika could only steel himself and go.

Yang Kai nodded, turned and rushed into the pavilion, carried the unconscious Xue Yue out, exchanged a glance with Halika, and the two flew off together.

Staring at their departing backs, Lin Mufeng pursed his lips and sighed, "I hope Old Ha won't end up like me, chased by that man for half a month..."

The middle-aged woman also wore a look of worry, secretly thinking this matter was indeed thorny.

As they sped along, Halika briefly recounted the tale of that peculiar, ill-tempered alchemist. Only then did Yang Kai learn the man called himself Zong Ao, and that he had arrived on Rainfall Star nearly a hundred years ago and had stayed ever since.

He had made various agreements with the Hengluo Commerce Guild and enjoyed status even higher than those dozen alchemists.

"He demanded a territory of three thousand li and built his dwelling in a valley. He has parceled the valley into herb-fields and planted many rare medicinal herbs. He hates being disturbed while refining pills; normally no one approaches that valley. Even when our Guild's people deliver herbs, they strictly follow his instructions and go only at specified times..."

Fearing Yang Kai's youthful arrogance and lack of caution might rashly offend Zong Ao, Halika detailed Zong Ao's situation on the way, stressing his exceptional status and proud temper.

The more Yang Kai listened, the stranger his expression became.

He felt as if he had been to Zong Ao's residence before!

Half a day later, Halika suddenly pointed ahead and said, "See that valley? That's Master Zong Ao's dwelling."

Yang Kai looked ahead and couldn't help a wry laugh; that valley was exactly the place where he had earlier discerned the diagram for probing spirit formations.
