## Chapter 652 — The Focal Point of the Struggle

Time passed swiftly; in the blink of an eye a month had gone by.

Yang Kai knew opportunities were rare; during that month he naturally spared no effort in circulating the True Yang Technique, crazily absorbing Yang Yuan energy.

After a month, there was even a faint feeling of saturation within his Dantian.

Countless drops of Yang Liquid gathered in his Dantian, beyond counting. At first Yang Kai cared about the amount of Yang Liquid, but by the end he himself did not know how much he had amassed.

His entire body was filled with power.

With so much Yang Liquid, Yang Kai estimated he could squander it for many years without worry.

Moreover, as Yang Kai frantically drew it in, the nearby magma seemed slightly affected, no longer as scorching as before and instead showing signs of solidifying.

Centered on where he stood, within roughly a one li radius, the Yang Yuan energy in heaven and earth had greatly diminished.

Yang Kai very much wanted to go deeper to the base of the volcano to investigate whether there were more opportunities, but the deadline he had agreed with Han Fei was approaching, so he could only wait.

He did not want to provoke that cold, beautiful woman and give her an excuse to question him.

He waited and waited, but Han Fei still did not appear.

Yang Kai grit his teeth, burst out of his hiding place, and followed the flow of magma downward.

True Yuan wrapped around his body, forming a protective membrane; although the magma's heat was oppressive, it caused no harm to Yang Kai.

As if endless, the deeper Yang Kai went the more he could feel the abundance and richness of energy. This environment was very suitable for a martial artist like him to cultivate in, but for members of the Ancient Demon Clan it was a place to be treated with caution and kept at a distance.

He had no intention of fleeing. In this sealed Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai knew he had no true hiding place unless he hid beneath this volcano for the rest of his life.

He only wanted to see what mysteries lay below.

After diving for a full hour he still had not reached the bottom; the surrounding temperature and heat had risen to a level even Yang Kai could not endure.

Stamping his foot where he stood, he thought for a moment and shook his head in frustration.

Although he very much wanted to probe further, it seemed that continuing downward would put even himself in danger; to act rashly before knowing whether any benefit could be gained would be more loss than gain.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai reluctantly gave up and turned to fly upward.

Another hour later, he finally returned to the spot where he had been cultivating.

There, Han Fei surveyed the surroundings with a chilling expression, as if she had mistakenly believed Yang Kai had fled and was grinding her teeth in anger.

When she saw Yang Kai she immediately shouted angrily, "Where did you go?"

"I went down to take a look," Yang Kai shrugged.

"Down?" Han Fei's slender brows knitted slightly. "You could go down?"

Even she could not penetrate very far; this position was nearly her limit. That a human could reach a lower layer naturally surprised her.

"I cultivate a Yang-attribute method; here I'm like a fish in water," Yang Kai chuckled.

That explanation did not satisfy Han Fei, for even cultivating a Yang-attribute method alone would not allow one to delve into this place without other abilities.

She did not press the matter, only saying, "You obtained what you wanted, right?"

Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

"Then let's go; Lady Li should already be anxious," Han Fei said. Without waiting for Yang Kai to reply, she unleashed True Yuan to wrap him and shot upward.

Soon the two were flying above the volcano's mouth.

At that moment Yang Kai suddenly tugged Han Fei's arm and whispered, "Wait!"

Han Fei's delicate body stiffened; she glared at Yang Kai and snapped, "What are you doing?"

She seemed unaccustomed to being touched, especially by men; even a small movement could provoke an unusually strong reaction from her.

"I'll check for myself!" Yang Kai said with a cold, stern look.

Han Fei was taken aback. She unfurled her Divine Sense, and soon her pretty face grew even darker.

If even Yang Kai could detect the abnormalities around the volcano, how could Han Fei not notice? It was only that a moment ago she had not been sufficiently alert and had not paid attention to her surroundings.

"It appears we have trouble," Yang Kai said with a cold, dry chuckle; his hawk-like eyes swept through the void without pause.

"Don't speak, I'll deal with it!" Han Fei warned. Her beautiful eyes suddenly fixed on a spot and she cried out coldly, "Chu Jian, come out!"

A hearty laugh rang out. Chu Jian, whom Yang Kai had met once before, revealed himself from concealment, looking at Han Fei with a mocking gaze; a lecherous gleam flashed in his eyes as he laughed, "Commander Han Fei, what a coincidence to meet you here."

Saying that, his narrow eyes glowered at Yang Kai, then turned away to fix burning attention on Han Fei, showing not the slightest regard for Yang Kai.

"Chu Jian, what are you doing here?" Han Fei's voice was icy as she cast an unfriendly look at him.

The area around the volcano was forbidden territory for the Ancient Demon Clan; no one would lightly venture there. She did not believe Chu Jian had happened upon her by accident.

As Chu Jian spoke, figures began to appear one after another around them; those figures were the strong from Chu Jian's domain, each grinning wickedly as they looked this way, encircling the volcano's mouth.

The other side was obviously prepared; they had clearly received word and lay in ambush here long ago.

"I do not wish to do anything. I only ask Commander Han Fei to grant me the favor of allowing me to take this human boy away!" Chu Jian said at ease, sneering.

"You have a lot of nerve!" A cold gleam flashed in Han Fei's beautiful eyes as her feelings flared with anger. "This outsider is Lady Li's honored guest and the hope of our Ancient Demon Clan. Do you intend to sever our clan's hope? Chu Jian, stop this nonsense. Lady Li's kindness toward you does not mean she will always indulge you!"

"Lady Li?" Chu Jian snorted. "One day I will replace her and become the true master of Mo Shen Fort! Our Ancient Demon Clan is brave and warlike; even imprisoned here we should not be reduced to having our fangs worn away by time. Lady Li is too soft-hearted to govern Mo Shen Fort — I, Chu Jian, am the most suitable candidate!"

Those of Chu Jian's followers nearby, upon hearing these words, instantly radiated a violent, dangerous aura. As he had said, even after being imprisoned for countless years, the strong who gathered under Chu Jian remained bellicose.

"You are mad," Han Fei said with a face of disappointment, slowly shaking her head. "Although we've long known of your treacherous designs and wolfish ambition, we did not expect you to be so obsessed. Chu Jian, if you do not turn back, the only road that awaits you is death!"

"Death?" Chu Jian roared, "Who knows whether it will be me who dies or you?"

Sensing Chu Jian's murderous intent, Han Fei felt a chill go through her; she realized he was serious this time. If he wanted to seize control of Mo Shen Fort, he would have to eliminate rivals first, and she and Hua Mo would be the first he intended to remove.

Having resided in this Small Xuan Realm for who knew how many years, Han Fei had actually forgotten the scheming and deceit she had learned from humans.

"Han Fei, I'll give you one chance!" Chu Jian stretched out a large hand and pointed at her, his face solemn. "Submit to me and I will take you as my wife; you will join me and together we will rule Mo Shen Fort. As long as this human boy can refine a Saint-Grade Pill, we can break free from this world's shackles — far more promising than remaining by Lady Li's side!"

Han Fei looked at Chu Jian with scorn and sneered, "You want me to marry you? Have you lost your senses? Even if I were to marry this human, I would never marry you!"

"Hey, why drag me into this?" Yang Kai immediately objected.

He did not care about the infighting within Mo Shen Fort. Who won or lost was none of his concern. But now that he had become the focus of their struggle, Yang Kai could not remain uninvolved.

No matter who won, he remained the key; the victorious side would inevitably have demands on him.

"Shut up; you have no place to speak here!" A faint blush rose on Han Fei's pretty face as she glared at Yang Kai; the blush quickly faded.

Chu Jian shook his head in disappointment, his face full of wounded pride. "You are wrong. It is precisely because Lady Li is too merciful that I want to take control of Mo Shen Fort! If we escape this world and go outside, with her weakness we of the Ancient Demon Clan would have no foothold. If she truly would move against me, perhaps I might not have formed such intentions, but you'll see: even knowing what I do today, Lady Li will not severely punish me. That woman... she was never fit to be born into the Ancient Demon Clan!"

"Do not use Lady Li's mercy as an excuse for your presumption!" Han Fei cried. "If Mo Shen Fort were truly in your hands, that would be the greatest misfortune for our clan!"

"You disappoint me too much," Chu Jian said, shaking his head. "Han Fei, I'll ask you one last time: are you willing to join me to create a great cause? If you dare refuse again, I will show no mercy to those under you. There are plenty of beautiful women — what I care about is your Saint Realm cultivation!"

"Give up that thought!" Han Fei roared and acted first. Enveloping Yang Kai, her delicate form turned into a streak of light as she charged outward, attempting to break the encirclement while Chu Jian was unprepared.

As long as they could break through Chu Jian's encirclement, Han Fei was confident she could bring Yang Kai back to Mo Shen Fort.

But since Chu Jian had come prepared, he naturally would not give her that chance.

The instant Han Fei made a move, he moved as well.

Before they could clearly see his trajectory, he had already blocked Han Fei's path. He flung open his massive hand; an aura of malevolent power instantly spread forth, and a snarling beast’s maw snapped toward Han Fei and Yang Kai.

Han Fei's expression changed; she hurriedly retreated with Yang Kai. As her fair hand waved, wave after wave of gentle power fanned out like wind.

Boom, boom, boom...

Violent explosions rang out as brilliant halos spread in all directions. As the halos expanded, Chu Jian's attack was dissolved by Han Fei into nothing.

"So many years without fighting, Han Fei — your strength has improved nicely," Chu Jian said composedly, laughing loudly. His figure flickered, suddenly multiplying into thousands; each one was uncannily realistic, each exactly like Chu Jian himself.

The next moment, those countless figures swung their fists and smashed toward Han Fei's delicate body.
