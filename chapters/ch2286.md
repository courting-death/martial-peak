## Chapter 2286 — Not Selling for Now

“There’s such a thing?” Yang Kai exclaimed in surprise after hearing this. He truly hadn’t known that the identity tokens of Qingyang Shrine disciples actually came in different ranks.

The Qingyang Gold Token Gao Xueting had given him was indeed quite extraordinary, a clear sign of her trust in him and recognition of his strength.

"Young Master Yang really didn't know..." Ye Qinghan said with a wry smile.

"It’s just a token." Yang Kai replied casually, pouring his Divine Sense into the token to inform Gao Xueting, then put it away and said, "Let’s go."

Ye Qinghan tucked away her complicated expression, brightened slightly, and nodded, "Alright!"

As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Kai gathered her up, and with a single teleport they appeared somewhere outside the city. Then, Yang Kai summoned his wooden boat Secret Treasure, stepped onto it, beckoned to Ye Qinghan, and after she flew up and stood firm, he formed a hand seal with one hand, and they sped off like the wind.

The wooden boat wasn’t large, but it was no problem for two people to stand on it. Moreover, it was a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level flying Secret Treasure, just a step away from being an Imperial Treasure, so its speed was astonishing, covering a thousand zhang in an instant.

Before this, Yang Kai didn’t even remember where he’d heard the name Thousand Leaves Sect, and he didn’t know much about it.

Taking advantage of the journey, Yang Kai briefly asked Ye Qinghan about the situation of Thousand Leaves Sect.

According to Ye Qinghan, Thousand Leaves Sect had once been a great Sect in the Southern Territory. Although it couldn’t compare to top Sects like Qingyang Shrine or Tianwu Sacred Land, it wasn’t far behind. But ever since the entrance to their secret realm was closed, the Sect could no longer be bathed in abundant Spiritual Qi, and many secret techniques and arts were lost. The Sect declined rapidly, and as time passed, its strength waned further. By the time of Ye Qinghan’s father, Ye Hen, the Sect had fallen into obscurity. Now, Ye Hen was the only Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator in the entire Sect, even weaker than Biyu Sect.

Although Biyu Sect also had no Emperor Realm cultivators, when Yang Kai visited, there were at least four experts at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

The last time Four Seasons Land opened, Biyu Sect had two spots to enter, but Thousand Leaves Sect had none at all, showing the gap between them.

Thousand Leaves Sect was nestled within the Chiyue Mountains of Jiangzhou, deep in the Southern Territory, about half a month’s journey from Fenglin City.

Fenglin City originally had a Space Array that led directly to Jiangzhou City, but ever since the last time Demonic Qi besieged the city and Drunken Old Man destroyed the array in a desperate battle, it had never been repaired.

After all, Fenglin City was too small, and people like Duan Yuanshan had little influence, so they couldn’t invite a suitable Formation Master to repair the Space Array.

But now, this problem probably wouldn’t last much longer. Once the Linghu Palace matter was settled, Xiao Yuyang and the others would surely have their Sects’ Formation Masters restore the array as good as new.

In the future, Fenglin City was destined to become one of the great cities of the Southern Territory, and the Space Array would surely connect all the cities in the region.

Yang Kai figured that next time he wanted to return to Fenglin City, it would be much easier—he’d just need to find a decent-sized city and use the Space Array to teleport straight there.

On the way, Yang Kai and Ye Qinghan chatted idly.

Only now did he learn that Thousand Leaves Sect was a Sect specializing in refining and controlling puppets, and most of its disciples cultivated puppet arts. It was quite remarkable.

This was the first time Yang Kai had encountered such a Sect in the Star Realm. There are three thousand Daos, all leading to the Emperor. Puppet arts were not weak, but because the requirements for cultivation were harsh and refining puppets was extremely complicated, few people achieved much in this field. But if one could master puppet arts to the extreme, it would be a formidable means indeed.

"Since your Thousand Leaves Sect specializes in puppets, why have I never seen you use one?" Yang Kai asked in confusion.

Even last time, when they encountered danger beneath the Spring Source, Ye Qinghan hadn’t used her puppet.

Hearing Yang Kai’s question, Ye Qinghan’s cheeks flushed with a hint of embarrassment. She hesitated, then said softly, “It’s nothing to hide, though Young Master Yang may find it laughable. My Thousand Leaves Sect was once renowned throughout the world for our puppet arts, but ever since a former Sect Master took many of our manuals and secret techniques into the secret realm, several of our core methods for refining and controlling puppets have been lost. Now, the puppets we can make in Thousand Leaves Sect... are hardly of much use.”

As she spoke, she gently pursed her red lips, formed a hand seal, and suddenly a small green bird appeared in her palm.

Yang Kai looked closely and found that the little bird was lifelike, just like a living creature. Even its feathers were distinct and naturally colored. But after probing it with his Divine Sense, he could tell it wasn’t made of flesh and blood, but was a puppet refined from various materials.

Yang Kai was amazed. If one didn’t use Divine Sense to examine it carefully, it would be hard to tell if it was alive or not.

Ye Qinghan changed her hand seal again, stretched out a slender finger, and tapped the little bird.

In the next moment, the green bird shone with light, flapped its wings a few times, tilted its head, and suddenly flew up, circling Ye Qinghan repeatedly. Not only that, it even let out bird calls that were almost indistinguishable from the real thing.

Yang Kai was full of praise, nodding repeatedly, "Your Sect’s puppet arts are truly impressive."

Ye Qinghan blushed and said, "Young Master Yang flatters me. Our Sect’s puppet arts can only make things like this now, useful for scouting, but useless in real combat. Because of this, some elders have started cultivating other arts and secret techniques, thinking puppet arts are pointless."

Yang Kai snorted, "That’s just shortsightedness."

Ye Qinghan’s beautiful eyes lit up, "Young Master Yang also thinks the Dao of Puppets is good?"

Yang Kai said seriously, "I haven’t studied it myself, but I know powerful puppets can’t be underestimated. It’s said that in the Star Realm, there are puppets so strong that even those in the Emperor Realm have to avoid them."

Ye Qinghan smiled bitterly, "I don’t hope to make such puppets, I just don’t want Thousand Leaves Sect’s heritage to truly die out. Unfortunately... the key to refining puppets is the Spirit Core, and our Sect no longer has the methods to make high-grade Spirit Cores. If we did, we could surely restore our former glory."

"Spirit Core?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, suddenly remembered something, reached out into the air, and a few pigeon-egg-sized crystals emitting a strange light appeared in his palm.

Before he could speak, Ye Qinghan cried out in surprise, "Spirit Cores? Young Master Yang, how do you have Spirit Cores?"

"I got them in Four Seasons Land," Yang Kai replied.

Back then, in the Time Temple, the first trial everyone faced was an endless horde of puppets. The Spirit Cores in Yang Kai’s hand were collected after defeating those puppets. There weren’t many, just a few pieces.

"Four Seasons Land..." Ye Qinghan’s face darkened, but she quickly brightened up again, "Young Master Yang, can I take a look at these Spirit Cores?"

Yang Kai glanced at her and casually tossed one over.

Ye Qinghan caught it joyfully and played with it in her hand like a child with a new toy, her face full of delight.

"The spirit array on this Spirit Core seems very ancient. Some of the patterns and veins have long been lost, and the grade of this Spirit Core isn’t low. If I’m not mistaken, it should have come from a Dao Origin-Grade puppet, right?"

Yang Kai nodded, "That’s right. I’m impressed you could tell."

Ye Qinghan said, "You flatter me, Young Master Yang. I’ve studied puppets since I was young, so I know a bit. With this Spirit Core, I could definitely refine a Dao Origin-Grade puppet..."

As she spoke, she gripped the Spirit Core tightly and looked at Yang Kai with pleading eyes, "Young Master Yang, I have a presumptuous request!"

"If it’s presumptuous, then don’t ask!" Yang Kai didn’t need her to say it to know what she wanted. He pried open her fingers and took back the Spirit Core, grinning, "I only have a few of these, so I’m keeping them."

"Young Master Yang..." Ye Qinghan looked at him with deep resentment, as if he’d abandoned her, "Can’t you sell me one? You don’t even need them."

She was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the same as Yang Kai. If she could refine a Dao Origin-Grade puppet, her strength would soar. For someone who had studied puppets since childhood and was obsessed with them, this was a gift from the heavens.

Not only that, she could study the structure of the Spirit Core and maybe discover some secrets, allowing her to mass-produce them. If that happened, Thousand Leaves Sect’s strength would multiply.

"Young Master Yang, just sell me one, please!" Seeing her pleas were useless, Ye Qinghan grabbed Yang Kai’s arm and shook it, acting like a spoiled child.

Yang Kai smirked wickedly, "Miss Ye, is it really appropriate for you to be pulling on me like this in the wilderness?"

Ye Qinghan’s pretty face flushed red. Realizing it was improper, she let go as if shocked and said sadly, "Then what will it take for you to sell me one, Young Master Yang?"

"Not selling for now," Yang Kai replied.

"For now?" Ye Qinghan raised her eyebrows, catching the hidden meaning in his words. Her eyes brightened, "Then when will you sell it?"

Yang Kai chuckled, "That depends. Maybe I’ll never sell, maybe I’ll sell when the time is right."

"You..." Ye Qinghan stomped her foot in frustration, but there was nothing she could do about Yang Kai.

Before she finished speaking, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly turned serious and he stopped in his tracks.

Ye Qinghan, standing behind Yang Kai on the wooden boat, almost bumped into him, but she reacted quickly, steadied herself with a burst of Origin Qi, and complained, "Young Master Yang, what are you doing!"

Yang Kai didn’t answer her. He just stared coldly at the surrounding void, a sneer and mockery on his face.

"What’s wrong?" Seeing his expression, Ye Qinghan couldn’t help but ask. For some reason, she suddenly felt a chill all over, as if something dangerous was watching her.
