## Chapter 558 — Let's See What You Can Offer

Upon arriving outside the mansion, after taking in the number and caliber of the martial artists assembled, Yang Kai’s expression instantly grew solemn.

These people must have come well prepared; otherwise, they would not have mobilized such a formidable lineup. The leader’s aura was restrained, his eyes shining brilliantly, exerting immense pressure on Yang Kai.

He should be beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

As Yang Kai stepped out, countless pairs of eyes fixed upon him.

Li Yuanchun’s expression was kindly as he inquired, “May I ask if you are the young master of the Yang Family, Yang Kai?”

“That is correct. And you are...”

“I am Li Yuanchun of the Tai Yi Sect.”

“Yefang of the Shura Sect.”

“Hua Duanhun of the Falling Flower Divine Sect... heh heh.”

“Xu Qianhao of the Chilian Sect.”

“Twin Island...”

“Yunlong Island...”

The leaders from various overseas factions introduced themselves while scrutinizing Yang Kai. The more they looked, the more astonished they became. The young girl beside him had already amazed them, but seeing Yang Kai now stunned them even further.

This young master of the Yang Family was even younger than that girl, yet he possessed cultivation at the Second Stage Divine Roaming Realm.

Yang Kai nodded slightly in acknowledgement and scanned the crowd. Then his gaze suddenly fixed on the girl beside him, his expression turning strange. “Biluo?”

The girl snorted coldly, clearly showing some disdain for Yang Kai.

Qiu Yimeng also cast a glance at Biluo. Upon seeing her, she too was filled with doubt and then turned toward Yang Kai, a faint ambiguous smile appearing on her face.

Biluo was the girl of Shan Qingluo’s household, the Enchantress Queen of the Cangyun Evil Land. When Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman had been confined by Shan Qingluo, they had dealings with her. One day, Qiu Yimeng even accidentally caught Biluo and Yang Kai in a compromising situation.

Seeing that girl now, Qiu Yimeng could not help but recall that scene and the milky fluid at the corner of her mouth...

Her face instantaneously flushed red.

Yang Kai’s thoughts drifted along similar lines, and subconsciously his gaze lingered on Biluo’s soft, delicate lips.

Those lips... not bad.

“So it seems young Master Yang and this young lady are old acquaintances.” Li Yuanchun chuckled, “We happened to meet here as well but did not come together.”

“I understand.” Yang Kai nodded. Li Yuanchun and the others were from overseas, while Biluo originated from the Cangyun Evil Land, so it was natural they did not arrive as a group.

But... what was Biluo doing here? A sudden unease arose within Yang Kai.

“I know why you are here. Please, come inside first and we'll speak.” Yang Kai gestured, stepping aside to make room.

Hearing this, the overseas guests brightened instantly, their expressions becoming much more amicable. At the very least, he did not deny having acquired those sect relics.

Could this mean he was willing to return them?

With these thoughts, they all entered the mansion one by one.

“Biluo, you come in too.” Yang Kai called.

“You go ahead. I want to keep my distance from you,” Biluo snorted. Ever since they had that ambiguous incident between them that day, she had been very wary of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled wryly and did not press her, instead turning to Qiu Yimeng. “Take care of her.”

“Mm.” Qiu Yimeng nodded lightly and smiled at Biluo, “Miss Biluo, long time no see.”

“It’s you,” Biluo giggled, “It’s been a while.”

As she spoke, she rushed forward and grabbed Qiu Yimeng’s hand with great warmth.

Though Qiu Yimeng found it somewhat odd, she thought Biluo was just being friendly, so she allowed her to hold her hand, and together they walked inside.

“That busty little girl?” Biluo’s beautiful eyes gleamed strangely as she asked Qiu Yimeng.

“You mean Xiaoman?” Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly. “She’s also here; you’ll see her soon.”

“Oh?” Biluo laughed with a dreamy expression.

In the same side hall as before, the overseas guests took their seats while Yang Kai had tea served. The atmosphere was harmonious, and everyone sipped tea and rested, appearing quite unhurried.

Yang Kai did not take the initiative to speak, only drinking tea quietly and watching Biluo secretly molest Qiu Yimeng over there.

Miss Qiu seemed to sense something was amiss too, as Biluo kept rubbing her hand and complimenting how smooth and well-maintained her skin was, occasionally touching her slender waist and chest.

Qiu Yimeng’s face flushed deeply.

But in such a public setting, she could not resist and instead cast a pleading glance toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai pretended not to see.

After a while, Li Yuanchun laughed and said, “Young Master Yang truly is a paragon among men. Although on the way here we heard much about the Yang Family’s Succession War and some of your exploits, only upon arriving at your estate today did we realize the rumors were not exaggerated. Your household truly conceals heroes that amaze all.”

“You flatter me, Senior.” Yang Kai replied lightly, “The mainland is unlike overseas. The islands abroad are rich in Spiritual Qi and countless treasures. That is truly the land we yearn for.”

Li Yuanchun laughed heartily, “Overseas has its conveniences, the mainland its own benefits. From your tone, it sounds like you have in fact been overseas.”

“Indeed. A few years ago, I went overseas once and suffered hardship at Yunxia Sect...”

Li Yuanchun’s eyes narrowed. “The Yunxia Sect destroyed by Gu Yun Island?”

“Exactly.”

“Gu Feng, the lord of Gu Yun Island, also found their lost three-hundred-year-old Transforming Moonbreaker Technique inside Yunxia Sect. So all this was orchestrated by you, young Master Yang.”

“Yes, I bore grievances with Yunxia Sect. Back then, weak as I was, I could only use Gu Yun Island’s force to destroy that sect.”

Li Yuanchun gasped, “Young Master Yang is truly bold!”

The others also became grim-faced.

How old was this man just a few years ago? With mere stratagem, he brought about the ruin of an entire sect. Such a character was indeed no ordinary person.

“Since you have found the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique, surely you have found other artifacts too?” Li Yuanchun’s gaze burned into Yang Kai.

“They are all with me.” Yang Kai chuckled and then produced a crimson long sword in his palm, a strikingly beautiful, fiercely charged blossom floating before them.

A faint floral fragrance spread.

“Shura Sword!”

“Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia!”

Yefang of the Shura Sect and Hua Duanhun of the Falling Flower Divine Cult rose immediately, their eyes greedily fixed on these Heaven-Grade treasures before Yang Kai, shouting in astonishment.

Their sects had searched fruitlessly for over three hundred years. Now, these relics suddenly appeared right in front of them—how could they not be excited?

“Sit!” Li Yuanchun commanded sternly.

Yefang and Hua Duanhun exchanged reluctant looks and finally sat down, yet their eyes never left their sect relics.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, calm and unperturbed, placing the Shura Sword and the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia on the nearby table as he leisurely regarded the overseas guests.

Li Yuanchun coughed lightly, frowning as he asked, “Young Master Yang, you say all these things are with you. Then why have I not sensed the aura of the Tai Yi Seal?”

Even if Yang Kai refined it into his body, Li Yuanchun could detect the Tai Yi Seal’s presence through their sect’s secret techniques.

The Tai Yi Seal was the Tai Yi Sect’s most treasured relic.

“The Tai Yi Seal requires your unique secret technique to refine. I have not refined it yet, so I placed it somewhere safe,” Yang Kai said with a smile. “The other items are also kept together.”

These items had been stored inside the Black Book Space, naturally imperceptible to Li Yuanchun and the others.

“I see.” Li Yuanchun nodded lightly, his doubts dispelled. “Young Master Yang’s frankness commands our respect.”

Before coming here, they feared denial and had prepared to resolve the matter through force if needed. They would not have sent over fifty Divine Roaming Realm experts, led by one beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, otherwise.

This showed how seriously they took the matter.

As Yang Kai had guessed, a few years ago Gu Yun Island suddenly discovered the long-lost three-hundred-year-old Transforming Moonbreaker Technique inside Yunxia Sect. Other overseas factions rushed to Gu Yun Island to investigate, but gained no useful information.

Once the excitement died down, the leaders convened and found the appearance of the Technique on Yunxia Island suspicious, concluding the Yunxia Sect had been framed.

Since the one who framed them obtained the Gu Yun Island’s Transforming Moonbreaker Technique, perhaps he had also obtained other sect treasures.

In recent years, overseas powers had been sending people to the mainland to gather intelligence. Yang Kai had acted multiple times, deploying the Shura Sword and Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia, inadvertently revealing clues. Once the news spread back, it gave these powers hope, prompting their hasty arrival.

Now that hope was realized, all were quite excited.

“You must know, young Master Yang, that while these items are not of the highest level and may have no direct use to martial artists, they hold special significance for us overseas sects. Each is an heirloom left by the founding patriarch, used as a token of office for the sect leader,” Li Yuanchun said sincerely, without arrogance or pressure.

Yang Kai slightly nodded. He had known this before—the items obtained from the Hidden Island were mostly tokens, some with no practical value.

“The purpose of our visit, young Master Yang, I believe you understand as well,” Li Yuanchun carefully chose his words, then hesitated before asking, “May I ask what conditions you require to return these items to us?”

“That depends on what you are willing to offer.” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, looking as if he were raising the price.

He did not particularly care about the items from the Hidden Island. He could even abandon the Shura Sword and Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia if he wished. As his strength rose, these things had little value for him. But giving them away for nothing was impossible.

He was no fool. To get these treasures, they needed to show sincerity.

Especially now, with numerous troubles weighing on him, and the overseas factions arriving at just this moment, it happened to collide with Yang Kai’s interests.

“This...” Li Yuanchun was immediately at a loss. They had come empty-handed, with little treasure or valuables. Yang Kai’s words naturally put them in an awkward position.
