## Chapter 2391 — Bihai Shuttle

Man Kuai's miserable scream made Yang Kai and the others change color in unison, all of them releasing their Divine Sense to look back and investigate.

When they saw his current state clearly, everyone couldn't help but gasp.

At this moment, for some unknown reason, Man Kuai's hands were pressed tightly against that slab of the exotic Heavenly Gold, as if they were stuck fast and couldn't be pulled away no matter how he struggled. If that were all, it might not be so bad, but the slab was actually devouring the essence of his Qi and blood at a speed beyond imagination. With the naked eye, one could see the crimson power of his Qi and blood being completely swallowed by the slab. The previously unremarkable stone slab turned blood-red in an instant, emitting a nauseating aura.

"Master, save me!" Man Kuai shouted with all his might, panic-stricken. If he had known this stone slab was so strange, he would never have touched it rashly. But now, it was too late for regrets.

In just a few breaths, he already felt half his strength drained. If this continued, wouldn't he be sucked dry and turned into a dried corpse?

Yang Kai and the others all turned their gazes to Sangde, wanting to see what he would do.

Sangde hurriedly said, "Don't panic, I'll be right there!"

As he spoke, he rushed straight to Man Kuai. Violent power fluctuations came from that direction, as if Sangde was doing his best to rescue him. But no one could see exactly what was happening, because Sangde's movements greatly disturbed their Divine Sense.

Before long, Man Kuai's voice gradually faded away.

Sangde returned slowly from that side, his face gloomy. When he came before the group, he said with a pained expression, "Brother Man... has, unfortunately, passed away."

Snake Lady and Shen Fei's faces changed slightly, their gazes dark as they looked at Sangde. Yang Kai's expression was also cold as water.

They all knew how strong Man Kuai was, but such a person died in such a short time. It was clear he had fallen into some terrible restriction or trap. If it had been Snake Lady or Shen Fei instead, they probably wouldn't have fared any better.

"How hateful! There was actually a Soul-Devouring Grand Array hidden on that Dragon-Suppressing Stone. I failed to notice it in time, causing Brother Man to suffer this disaster. It's truly tragic and infuriating!" Sangde sighed deeply, his tone low, as if he was grieving for Man Kuai's fate.

He paused for a moment, then looked up and said, "I hope Brother Man's misfortune hasn't left any of you with lingering shadows in your hearts."

The others remained silent and indifferent.

As for whether Sangde had truly failed to notice the Soul-Devouring Grand Array or had known about it all along and deliberately let Man Kuai die, no one could say. In any case, they had come this far, and since only an outsider had died, no one was going to back out now.

After this incident, however, no one dared to let their guard down. In this Imperial-Grade Formation Master's lair, any place could be deadly.

"If you have no objections, let's continue," Sangde said, sweeping his gaze over the group.

Yang Kai said calmly, "Master, you prepared for five people. Now that one is gone, will there be any problems going forward?"

Sangde replied, "It's not a big problem. I brought Man Kuai mainly to have him move the Dragon-Suppressing Stone. Hasn't he already completed his task? The rest doesn't require his effort."

"I see!" Yang Kai grinned. "That's good, Master, please lead the way."

Sangde nodded and indeed took the lead ahead.

The remaining three exchanged glances and followed at a leisurely pace. After Yang Kai's question just now, the three were almost certain that Sangde had known about the Soul-Devouring Grand Array on the Dragon-Suppressing Stone and what would happen to Man Kuai after moving it. He had simply kept silent on purpose. In other words, after the stone was moved, Man Kuai was no longer useful—whether he lived or died didn't matter.

This old fox always looked harmless on the surface, but in truth, he was full of schemes and trickery. Both Snake Lady and Shen Fei had long since learned to keep their guard up around him.

The group proceeded without encountering the slightest obstacle.

This was indeed a cave dwelling left behind by an expert. The interior was spacious, with glowing strange stones embedded in the walls on both sides, emitting a faint light that kept the cave from being too dim.

After half an hour, the group had walked more than a thousand zhang underground before suddenly arriving at a huge stone cavern.

Stalactites hung upside down from the stone walls, and water droplets fell, making crisp splashing sounds.

Upon arriving, everyone's gaze was immediately drawn to an object placed at the very center.

There, in the very center, rested a spindle-shaped Secret Treasure, more than seven or eight zhang long, its entire form sleek and graceful. Lines of artifact light flowed across its surface, imbuing it with an extraordinary presence.

Upon seeing it, Sangde's eyes lit up, and he stared fixedly at the spindle-shaped Secret Treasure, unwilling to look away for even a moment.

Yang Kai and the others were also filled with amazement. They all knew Sangde had brought them here to obtain a tool to leave the Jixu Secret Realm, and seeing this object, they naturally made the connection.

"Master, could this be..." Snake Lady was the first to lose her composure and asked.

Shen Fei didn't speak, but his eager eyes betrayed him.

"That's right!" Sangde nodded heavily. "This is the Bihai Shuttle refined by that old ghost! Though it's not an Imperial Treasure, it's only lacking Imperial Aura. With it, I can leave this Jixu Secret Realm!"

He looked extremely excited, his emotions running high.

Shen Fei and Snake Lady were also wild with joy, never expecting things to go so smoothly.

After all, following Sangde here, apart from needing five people to break the Waterlight Ten-Color Grand Array before entering the island, they hadn't encountered any real difficulties. Only Man Kuai had met with misfortune. They had simply followed Sangde here and now saw this special tool—it was practically handed to them on a silver platter.

"Master, don't forget our contributions when it's time to leave!" Shen Fei quickly reminded him.

Sangde chuckled and said, "Of course I won't forget." He paused, then continued, "The array flags I gave you earlier—do you still have them?"

Though they didn't know why he was asking, everyone took out the array flags they had received before. These flags had been used to break the Waterlight Ten-Color Grand Array, and after it was broken, Sangde hadn't taken them back, so everyone had kept theirs.

"Very good," Sangde smiled. "There's another array near the Bihai Shuttle that needs to be broken. I'll need your help!"

Snake Lady quickly said, "Just tell us what to do, Master!"

Things had come to this point, so she was very cooperative, having long forgotten about Man Kuai's tragic death.

"Follow me!" Sangde waved his hand and flew toward the Bihai Shuttle. The others hurried after him, each secretly excited and eager.

Before they could get close to the Bihai Shuttle, Sangde, still in midair, suddenly formed a hand seal and spat out a word. Then, at great speed, he shot forward.

The moment he uttered that word, Yang Kai and the other two sensed something was wrong. When they saw him suddenly fly away, they immediately realized the old man was up to something.

Startled, the three were about to give chase when a loud bang erupted from Shen Fei's hand.

The array flag in his hand suddenly exploded, sending violent waves of power in all directions. Shen Fei was blasted senseless, his protective Origin Qi instantly shattered.

Before he could recover, another explosion sounded—this time, it was Snake Lady's array flag that blew up.

Next was Yang Kai's. The three array flags exploded in succession, their power terrifying.

But Shen Fei and the others were no weaklings. Though caught off guard, they all summoned defensive Secret Treasures and activated their Origin Qi to protect themselves, barely avoiding instant death.

To be ambushed like this, and by Sangde no less, naturally left Shen Fei and Snake Lady furious. As soon as they withstood the blast, they wanted to settle accounts with Sangde.

But to their shock, in that instant, their bodies went limp, and they couldn't muster any strength. They fell heavily from midair, crashing to the ground, dizzy and disoriented.

Yang Kai didn't fare any better, falling beside the other two and remaining motionless.

"It's poison!" Shen Fei's face turned ashen, finally realizing that not only had Sangde planted an explosive restriction in the array flags, but the materials used to refine them were also problematic. Sangde must have planned this from the very moment he handed them over to break the Waterlight Ten-Color Grand Array.

Sangde's figure slowly walked over from a corner, his steps unhurried, his gaze calm and cold as he looked at the three lying on the ground, without a trace of pity.

"Master, why are you doing this?" Snake Lady couldn't understand at all. She hadn't shown any intention to harm him, and the Bihai Shuttle was clearly large enough inside to hold a dozen or twenty people. Sangde hadn't even gotten his hands on it yet—why turn on them now?

There was no conflict of interest, so why was Sangde doing this?

Shen Fei also looked at Sangde in anguish. He had always known Sangde was untrustworthy, but he hadn't expected the old man to turn so quickly. He thought even if Sangde did betray them, it would be after obtaining the Bihai Shuttle.

"Don't blame me, I had no choice," Sangde said blandly, not bothering to explain as he quickly formed hand seals with both hands.

As his hand seals changed, a strange sound rang out. The three turned their heads and were immediately horrified.

On the ground, holes had appeared from who knows where, and fresh blood was now bubbling out, flowing along the array patterns on the floor and gradually forming a mysterious design.

The blood smelled fresh, and the aura it contained felt familiar.

"Man Kuai's blood!" Shen Fei seemed to realize something, his face turning pale.
