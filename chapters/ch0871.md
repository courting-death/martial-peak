## Chapter 871 — Talks

Half an hour later, Yang Kai finally put away the Blood Essence Stone and told that Ancient Demon Clan member, "Move it around and see how it feels."

The man hurriedly clenched his fist; with a crackling sound the limb responded, and a look of delighted surprise flashed over his face. "It's really attached!" he exclaimed.

Li Rong and the others were stunned, hardly able to believe it.

Reattaching a severed arm—something normally impossible—had happened right before their eyes, which made them realize how extraordinary that Blood Essence Stone was.

"The flesh has reattached, but the bones aren't fully mended yet. Don't exert yourself for a while and remember to rest," Yang Kai cautioned.

The Ancient Demon Clan member nodded repeatedly, his face full of gratitude. "Thank you, Master, thank you!"

Although he had feigned indifference after losing his arm, now that his body was whole again he was naturally overjoyed.

"Go," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

The man bowed respectfully and ran back, excited.

Yang Kai toyed with the Blood Essence Stone in his hand and keenly noticed that much of its internal blood qi had been consumed.

It was an intriguing object; it seemed capable of converting ordinary blood into a strange power—one that restored and strengthened the body.

A product of the Starry Sky, it was indeed remarkable.

After watching for a moment, Yang Kai casually tossed the Blood Essence Stone to Li Rong and instructed, "See if there are any other clan members who need treatment. There's still plenty of blood qi stored inside—don't be stingy, use it as needed."

"Yes." Li Rong answered quickly and, together with the other leaders, busied herself.

There were barely a thousand Ancient Demon Clan members; Li Rong and the others valued every single one.

After they left, Wu Jie slowly approached, gazing at the Ancient Demon Clan members and remarking with feeling, "They are a very powerful people."

Yang Kai glanced at him and nodded lightly.

"Saint Lord, are you really going to take them along with us?"

"Yes."

Wu Jie couldn't help but frown. "So, Saint Lord, you don't intend to give up this power you've acquired?"

"Why would I give it up?"

"Bringing them with us will bring many troubles, unless you take them to the Demon Domain or some neutral territory."

Yang Kai shook his head and said plainly, "I'm taking them back to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land!"

Wu Jie was surprised, already imagining a fierce battle between the people of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and these demon clans.

If they truly went to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, they would be neighbors with the Netherworld Sect.

"Honestly, I don't much want to be entangled with the Saint Lord anymore…" Wu Jie said solemnly, offering a rueful smile.

Yang Kai looked at him and said calmly, "I won't force anyone. Since you once agreed to reconcile with me, you have the freedom to choose now. Of course, I won't come after you later—go wherever you wish. Besides, your Netherworld Sect hasn't suffered any losses this time."

Wu Jie nodded, then gave a low chuckle and murmured, "Perhaps I should keep my distance from you. The Saint Lord doesn't seem like someone who keeps still. But my instincts tell me you're destined for greatness—I want to see how far you'll rise, or whether you'll be destroyed on the way!"

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed. "If I'm destroyed, you won't escape death either. But if I grow strong, Sect Master Wu will gain much benefit."

"All I ask is for my sect's continuation!"

"I promise you."

The two exchanged a look and shared a knowing smile.

"Saint Lord, rest. At dawn we depart. The Nine Heavens Sacred Land is quite distant from here, and the road may be full of trouble."

Wu Jie said this and then respectfully took his leave.

……

A thousand zhang up, a black cloud surged rapidly, and within it countless figures stood; counting them out there were no fewer than a thousand.

They were all Ancient Demon Clan members.

Leaving the snowy mountains and heading toward the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, they had to cross many human territories; such a great host of demons traveling together would inevitably draw attention.

Yang Kai did not want to provoke conflict, and Li Rong and the others certainly didn't either; they could only fly high and try to avoid the sight of others.

At the front of the black clouds, Wu Jie led the Netherworld Sect scouts, searching for uninhabited routes to travel.

On Qixiu Peak of the Tianxiao Sect, Cang Yan and the others stood atop the peak, looking up at the rolling black clouds that swaggered past the Tianxiao Sect, and all of them burst into dry laughter.

"That brat…" Cang Yan slowly shook his head.

"I hope he has a safe journey," Fei Yu murmured, a trace of worry in her voice.

"There are many experts among that demon group; how could something happen to him?" Li Wan chuckled. "I'd worry more about those who provoke them. My junior nephew has a temper—if he fights, he'll definitely kill."

If he killed, Yang Kai's position would become all the more difficult.

"Worrying won't help. Since the junior nephew made this choice, he must have his reasons. It's fascinating—being the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land while commanding so many demons… what is he planning?"

None of them could fathom Yang Kai's thoughts; they only shook their heads and watched the black clouds speed away.

Inside the black clouds, once they learned the destination, Li Rong exclaimed in surprise, "So we're heading to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—Master is actually the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; that's remarkable."

"What, have you heard of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land in the Small Xuan Realm?" Yang Kai glanced at her.

"I've seen it recorded in the annals," Li Rong said with a small smile. "It's said to be a very powerful sect. Back when the Great Demon God still lived, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was one of humanity's foremost powers. Their Saint Lord once fought the Great Demon God and seems to have been defeated, though the Great Demon God was wounded—that was one of the few times the Demon God suffered injury."

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly and he nodded inwardly.

Li Rong had read the record in the books, but Yang Kai had witnessed fragments of that battle himself when he refined that drop of Demon God Golden Blood in the Sacred Tomb.

The nearly thousand Ancient Demon Clan members were jubilant; though they did not know the destination, being able to leave the Small Xuan Realm and come into this vast outside world was the greatest gift.

So each of them was lively, constantly peering around.

The road was uneventful; they traveled peacefully for ten-odd days.

With Wu Jie opening the way ahead, Yang Kai was spared a great deal of trouble.

Ten or so days later, while on the march, Li Rong suddenly furrowed her brow and fixed her attention on a spot below.

At the same time Yang Kai felt it too; their passage had likely alerted someone beneath. Several Transcendent Realm experts were tailing them, wanting to take a closer look.

"Master, shall we send someone to deal with them?" Li Rong asked.

Yang Kai hesitated a moment and then nodded slightly. "Don't kill them. Just make them stop following."

"Understood, Yinya!" Li Rong called.

Yinya, a commander within the formation, immediately flew down.

After a short time, faint battle fluctuations came from below.

A while later Yinya returned, reporting, "They won't be able to move for three to five days; we didn't injure them."

Li Rong nodded approvingly. "Good. Our clan has just reappeared in the world—if we can avoid trouble, we should."

The formation continued forward.

But as time passed and their journey lengthened, the presence emitted by the Ancient Demon Clan still alerted more and more human experts.

Each time it was Yinya or Xueji who went down to handle the matter, they immobilized those who chased so they couldn't pursue.

Though they showed mercy and never seriously injured anyone, news that a large demon clan had passed through human territories spread like wildfire.

As a result, people began to lie in wait along Yang Kai's route.

The ones trailing were mostly Transcendent Realm experts; most were sensible—sensing skilled figures among the Ancient Demon Clan, they dared not attack and only followed at a distance to gather information.

Occasionally a few arrogant fools tried to block them and speak insolently, and the Ancient Demon Clan's experts gave them a proper lesson.

Those people were like maggots on bone—drive one off and another appears.

Yang Kai was endlessly vexed but helpless.

The hatred between humans and demons could not be resolved overnight; it was inevitable the Ancient Demon Clan would be targeted. They couldn't, however, respond with wholesale slaughter—doing so would make them the world's public enemy.

It took a full two months before the group reached the vicinity of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Behind them, the pursuing force had grown to over a hundred—each a Transcendent Realm expert or higher, and more than a dozen had entered the Saint Realm.

Such strength forced Yang Kai to take them seriously.

It was time to talk to them properly.

He did not immediately allow the Ancient Demon Clan to enter the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; instead he had them halt in the long mountain range while he, accompanied only by Li Rong, went to where the pursuers had gathered.

Several li away, once those people noticed the Ancient Demon Clan had stopped, they also halted, sending out divine senses to spy on the situation.

Each human expert's face was extremely solemn.

"Old Chu, it looks like someone is coming…" one of them suddenly cried out.

The others all nodded, sensing the auras of Yang Kai and Li Rong.

"One at Transcendent Third Stage, one at Saint Second Stage—neither hiding… it seems they want to talk?" someone guessed.

If not, why would only two people come here?

"Demon scum—what's there to talk about with them? When they come over here we'll blast them to pieces!" a ruddy-faced elder shouted, his hostility toward demons plain.

"Yes, and it's the perfect chance to ambush them."
