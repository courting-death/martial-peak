## Chapter 1435 — Spiritual Qi Funnel

Half a year later, on one day, the Reception Hall of Lingxiao Sect was bustling with activity.

After half a year of waiting, with the Imperial Garden about to open, the forces that had received Yang Kai's promise naturally arrived early at Lingxiao Sect.

The visitors from Yingyue Hall were familiar faces: besides Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu there were Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er, but not all four were bound for the Imperial Garden; although Yingyue Hall had spent huge sums over the past half year to obtain a third piece of Imperial Jade, that was their limit, so Dong Xuan'er would not be able to go this time.

Yingyue Hall would dispatch Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu together, bringing Wei Guchang along.

As for Qiantian Sect, it was led by Mo Yu; besides him was a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert, an elderly white-haired man — the Sect Master Gu Zhen, whose strength slightly exceeded Mo Yu's. Shen Shitao had benefited from Yang Kai's favor and obtained a slot to enter the Imperial Garden.

By rights Shen Shitao's talent and cultivation did not merit entry to the Imperial Garden; Qiantian Sect was brimming with talent, with countless young disciples stronger or gifted more than her. But Mo Yu and Gu Zhen were seasoned elders who knew Qiantian Sect's connection to Lingxiao Sect depended entirely on Shen Shitao, so they would not abandon her; over the past half year they even bestowed upon her miraculous Spiritual Pill medicine, and several of the sect's elders jointly employed secret arts to raise her cultivation to the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

The price paid was not small!

Shen Shitao was overflowing with gratitude toward Yang Kai, standing behind Gu Zhen and Mo Yu, her bright eyes constantly glancing outward, longing to personally thank Yang Kai.

Yingyue Hall and Qiantian Sect had arrived as promised, and Liuli Sect was naturally present as well.

As Qian Tong had predicted, Daiyuan now also qualified to enter the Imperial Garden, and Liuli Sect's luck was considerable — they had acquired one more piece of Imperial Jade than Yingyue Hall, giving them a total of four slots.

Sect Master Gong Xinghe appeared in person; besides him and Daiyuan, the remaining two were Gong Aofu and Yin Sudie.

At this moment Yin Sudie bit her silver teeth in secret, her red lips moving as if murmuring, occasionally casting sulky glances at Daiyuan.

Daiyuan paid the display no heed; like Shen Shitao, her attention was fixed entirely outside, as if waiting for something. Her cultivation was now the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm as well, but unlike Shen Shitao she had broken through by her own effort, not through another's hand.

Both Gong Xinghe and Gong Aofu were greatly surprised by this result; none of them had expected her to rise to the Origin Returning Realm so swiftly, and had it not been so they might not have agreed to let Daiyuan enter the Imperial Garden.

It was precisely because Daiyuan displayed talent and a speed of advancement not inferior to Yin Sudie's that the two relented; after all she was their sect's disciple, and allowing her entry also provided an opportunity to make use of Lingxiao Sect to enter the Imperial Garden ahead of others.

Besides members from these three sects, there were two unfamiliar faces in the main hall, both of Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm caliber, their visages weathered and aged.

Yang Kai had not interacted with them before, but these two were also renowned across Dark Star.

The Hall Master and Great Elder of Piaomiao Hall — Piaomiao Hall was a first-rate force on Dark Star, so naturally their Hall Master and Great Elder's realms were not weak; they were present because they had handed an Imperial Jade to Lingxiao Sect.

It was that very piece of Imperial Jade that caused Lingxiao Sect to open its gates and lift the restrictions, welcoming them inside.

At this moment, there were already seven or eight Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts in the Reception Hall alone, and as many as three Sect Master-level figures, yet none dared to clamor or speak loudly; all wore solemn expressions.

The reason was plain: Ye Xijun was present here; with her stationed, who would dare act wantonly?

After sampling fragrant tea and eating spirit fruit, Qian Tong cleared his throat and looked toward the head seat at Yang Yan, asking, "Miss Yang Yan, has Yang Kai emerged from seclusion yet?"

Yang Yan shook her head slowly: "No movement yet."

Qian Tong frowned with worry. "He has been in seclusion for almost half a year; with the Imperial Garden about to open — perhaps in a day or two at the soonest, seven or eight days at the latest — he won't miss the opportunity, will he?"

"Elder Qian, your concerns are understandable, but I think he should not miss the chance; perhaps he will emerge within these few days," Yang Yan smiled faintly. Though her expression was calm, she was anxious inside.

She naturally knew why Yang Kai had secluded himself: to advance his strength further before the Imperial Garden opened. Yet thus far Tianyi Palace had shown no sign; whether his progress was smooth was unknown.

Wanting to investigate but fearing to disturb him, Yang Yan could only endure and wait patiently.

"You guests have traveled far; please return to your lodgings to rest. Before the Imperial Garden opens there will be heavenly anomalies; when that time comes, it will not be too late to set out," Yang Yan, now the Vice Sect Master, spoke with a composure greater than before.

Hearing this, the guests exchanged glances, rose to thank and take their leave, and prepared to return to the lodgings Lingxiao Sect had arranged for them.

But before they could leave the Reception Hall, the heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi suddenly trembled.

All present were top experts, highly sensitive to changes in Spiritual Qi; though the fluctuation was slight, they detected it.

Faces changed in unison; without further small talk with Yang Yan they blurred into motion and burst out of the Reception Hall, looking up into the sky.

In the sky the opening more than ten li across still existed, sunlight pouring through to nourish Lingxiao Sect's plants. Though outwardly unchanged, everyone felt a stifling sense as if a storm were brewing.

Soon the feeling intensified; the heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi churned and surged, like a wild horse cast free of its reins, setting hearts on edge.

"This is..." Gong Xinghe's eyelids narrowed, his face showing astonishment.

"Father, is this a sign that the Imperial Garden is about to open?" Gong Aofu asked softly, her eyes full of excitement; Yang Yan had said an opening would bring heavenly anomalies, and none had expected one so soon.

Many shared her expectation — Qian Tong, Fei Zhi Tu, Gu Zhen, Mo Yu, and the two Piaomiao Hall experts all wore looks of anticipation.

But very quickly the brows of these top experts furrowed and they withdrew their gazes, turning to look in another direction.

"No — someone is breaking through!" Qian Tong murmured, then paused, an excited expression spreading across his old face. "Yang Kai!"

He immediately connected the sign to the crucial figure.

Yang Yan brightened and, in a blur, sped toward the direction where Tianyi Palace stood.

Others naturally wanted to follow and see for themselves, but Ye Xijun's slight figure flashed forward and blocked them, her expression cool as she said, "Everyone stay where you are!"

Though most had some acquaintanceship with Yang Kai, now that he stood at the verge of a major ascension, Ye Xijun would not let them pass; a disturbance during such a breakthrough could cause catastrophic failure.

Thus she did not hesitate to stop them.

Qian Tong and the others understood and nodded, remaining where they were and watching from afar.

Seeing them behave, Ye Xijun said no more, and followed Yang Yan away.

In an instant, only Qian Tong and the remaining guests were left before the Reception Hall.

"Senior Brother, do you think Brother Yang can successfully ascend?" Dong Xuan'er asked with worry; she had gone through this step herself and knew how arduous it was to break from Saint King Realm to the Origin Returning Realm.

Every breakthrough in cultivation carries enormous risk — it is a struggle against heaven, earth, and oneself!

Not to speak of others, when she and Wei Guchang rose to the Origin Returning Realm, each had endured indescribable trials; the heaven-and-earth energy baptism during ascent nearly overwhelmed her, and the recurring inner demons almost caused her to fail.

Such tribulations are unrelated to talent; they must be faced by every cultivator.

Hearing Dong Xuan’er’s question, Wei Guchang grinned. “Don’t worry. I can’t speak for others, but Brother Yang will have no problem breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm.”

His words brimmed with confidence in Yang Kai; Yin Sudie sneered at the side, though she said nothing, inwardly hoping Yang Kai would simply die.

At the same time, three miles away from Tianyi Palace, Yang Yan stood still, quietly gazing in that direction.

She had not been there long before Wu Yi, Qian Yue, Chang Qi and others arrived in succession; after a brief exchange everyone understood the situation.

To prevent Yang Kai from being disturbed, orders were issued forbidding anyone from approaching within three li of Tianyi Palace; beyond that radius disciples were to patrol and stand guard so no ill-intentioned person could slip in.

No sooner had the orders been issued than wind and clouds above Tianyi Palace suddenly shifted.

In the sky a Spiritual Qi funnel suddenly appeared; when it first formed it only occupied an area of several zhang, but in the blink of an eye it thundered outward, rapidly expanding until it reached several mu in size before stabilizing.

As it rotated, a great pulling force affected a hundred li in every direction; the heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi was crazily drawn toward it.

Streaks of multicolored light shot past the crowd like bolts of ice, fire, and thunder, pouring one after another into the funnel, making the rumbling from within grow ever more intense.

"Five Elements Spiritual Qi?" Ye Xijun's brows knitted, her face showing astonishment.

Those differently colored lights were plainly the five-elements Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth converging; when the Imperial Garden once had a disturbance, the entire Dark Star had witnessed such a scene.

What unfolded now was somewhat similar to that day, yet not comparable in scale — it was by no means on the same level, but was still extraordinary.

The Imperial Garden is an imperial treasure; it is only natural that it could stir anomalies across Dark Star.

Yet now, merely because Yang Kai was about to break from Saint King Realm to the Origin Returning Realm, the heaven-and-earth Five Elements Spiritual Qi changed so dramatically that Ye Xijun could not help but be shaken.
