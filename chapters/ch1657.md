## Chapter 1657 — Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm

Icebound Island, within the Ice Palace, the island's senior ranks had gathered here.

Luo Li sat upright at the head; Bing Long, Ran Yunting and the other elders were seated on either side, while an elder was reporting on the island's seals and formation repairs.

The last cataclysmic battle had nearly shattered Icebound Island's sealing formations and arrays to pieces; the disciples had been repairing them over the past period, and only today had they finally finished.

However, those collapsed Ice Peaks could not be restored to their former glory; fortunately the disciples had withdrawn in time and there were no casualties — a rare piece of good news.

Luo Li had kept her eyes closed the whole time; only after the elder finished his report did she give a slight nod, though she showed no intention of speaking.

Bing Long glanced at her, then turned to another and asked, "Thirteenth Elder, any news of that man?"

At those words, Thirteenth Elder Yu Xueqing shook her head sadly. "None. We searched for him for a year before and found no trace. If he had not appeared of his own accord then, I doubt we would have been able to locate him. If he now wishes to hide his movements deliberately, there is nothing we can do."

"Sigh!" Bing Long sighed.

"Don't look for him anymore!" Luo Li suddenly opened her eyes and said coldly.

"Grand Elder..."

"If he does not want you to find him, what can you do? Besides, after that battle, he must be recovering his injuries."

"Recovering?" Bing Long and the others knit their brows in surprise, but they soon caught on. "You mean..."

"He used forbidden power; he will certainly have to pay a price," Luo Li said calmly.

"He was injured?" Ran Yunting's eyes brightened and a stirring light crossed her face. "If that's the case, then perhaps we could..."

Before she could finish, Luo Li shot her a cold glare; Ran Yunting immediately fell silent, not daring to utter another word.

"My Ice Heart Valley has endured to this day through great difficulty. My lifelong wish is not to push Ice Heart Valley further forward, but only to preserve our ancestral foundations — do you understand?" Luo Li's beautiful eyes swept the room, radiating boundless authority.

The assembly was taken aback and, reading the implication in Luo Li's words, rose hurriedly and said respectfully, "Your disciples understand."

"Good. If you understand, then do not bring trouble upon Ice Heart Valley."

Ran Yunting went pale and stammered, "Disciple was wrong!"

Luo Li gave a slight nod, pleased with her attitude, and then smiled faintly. "Call everyone who was searching to withdraw; he will return in time."

"He will return?" Some elders who did not know the full circumstances turned pale. The day Yang Kai slew Luo Hai had terrified them; the thought that this man might return to Icebound Island made them uneasy.

Bing Long seemed to understand something as well and smiled. “There’s still someone left on Icebound Island. Naturally, he’ll come back.”

Ran Yunting thought for a moment and said, "Do you mean that disciple Qing Ya?"

"Yes. Qing Ya and Su Yan entered Ice Heart Valley together and are very close. Even if Yang Kai does not return, Su Yan will certainly come back."

"Should we seek out Qing Ya and speak with her?" Ran Yunting frowned.

"I have already gone to see her a few days ago," Bing Long said with a wry smile.

"Oh? And what was the result? Did she know of Yang Kai and Su Yan's whereabouts? Is she clear about Yang Kai's attitude toward Ice Heart Valley?" Ran Yunting pressed.

"Though I went to see her, I could not meet her," Bing Long admitted with an embarrassed expression.

"How is that possible?" The elders were astonished.

"Yang Kai left a Stone Puppet to guard her. When I went there, that Stone Puppet struck me back," Bing Long explained, still showing traces of panic. "Had Qing Ya not stopped it in time, I might have been injured."

"That Stone Puppet is so formidable?" Ran Yunting's face changed.

She herself had seen the Stone Puppet; when she ordered Bing Die to kill Qing Ya that day, it was the Stone Puppet that protected Qing Ya. But at the time her attention had been fixed on Yang Kai and Su Yan, so she had not paid much heed to that strange being.

Now that Bing Long mentioned it, she realized the Stone Puppet was extraordinary.

"In direct confrontation, I am absolutely no match for it," Bing Long said gravely.

A chorus of sharp intakes of breath rang out.

Bing Long was Ice Heart Valley's top Origin Returning Realm expert — one of the foremost figures on Chi Lan Star — and if even she could not match it, then that Stone Puppet must possess strength approaching the Void King Realm.

What kind of existence could that be?

Everyone turned their eyes to Luo Li, hoping she could explain.

"Don't look to me — I don't know the origins of that Stone Puppet either. Perhaps it is a remnant automaton from ancient times, or perhaps a strange ancient creature."

Even the Grand Elder did not know? The assembly was shocked; in their understanding, the Grand Elder was almost omniscient, but that notion had been shattered today.

And the root of it all lay with Yang Kai.

"That disciple Qing Ya still harbors gratitude toward Ice Heart Valley, otherwise she would not have stopped the Stone Puppet from striking Bing Long. Do not disturb her; assign people to take good care of her. Yang Kai and Su Yan will return and take her away."

"Yes!" Bing Long bowed respectfully.

"If he comes again... do not be discourteous!" Luo Li left that admonition, and then vanished.

The elders exchanged glances and dispersed; only Ran Yunting remained behind, her face filled with endless regret.

......

Inside the Xuan Realm Pearl, in the loft where Xia Ningshang had once stayed, Yang Kai and Su Yan sat cross-legged facing one another, their palms pressed together.

Their Saint Yuan blended like water and milk, and a strange profound intent permeated the space around them.

Both of them looked somewhat pale.

The battle with Luo Hai had seemed simple and easy, but because of the use of that terrifying power, Yang Kai and Su Yan had both paid a heavy price.

So after the battle, Yang Kai had immediately left Ice Heart Valley, not even stopping for Qing Ya, to find a place to recuperate in peace.

In a sense, Luo Li’s judgment was indeed sharp and discerning.

Fortunately, this time the Star Emperor Token had been used after he and Su Yan had united their bodies and hearts. So although the price they bore was immense, with the two sharing it between them, it was still within what they could endure.

Yang Kai felt a sense of relief.

Had Su Yan not shared the burden and he had used the Star Emperor Token alone, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

The might of the Great Emperor was simply not something he could withstand alone.

Around them lay rows of Origin Saint Crystals. Beside them were several empty jade vessels — the Spiritual Pills inside had already been taken.

Pure energy flowed into their bodies, resolving injuries and hidden dangers; as time passed their complexions gradually returned and their breath slowed to a steady rhythm.

One day Yang Kai exhaled deeply and opened his eyes.

He met Su Yan's beautiful gaze.

They smiled at one another; after more than three months of recuperation, their injuries were finally healed.

"Junior Brother, did you break through?" Su Yan's eyes showed surprise.

"Seems so." Yang Kai realized the change within himself.

Before the fight with Luo Hai he had been at the peak of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; after that battle he had now reached the Third Stage.

Even he had not noticed when he had advanced; perhaps the Great Emperor's might had poured such vast energy into him that his bottleneck had been shattered without fanfare.

Moreover, the current Realm was extremely stable; Yang Kai need not worry further.

"You too." Yang Kai glanced at Su Yan and was surprised to find her cultivation equal to his — both at the Third Stage.

Su Yan pursed her lips and smiled.

The light of the entire world seemed to gather around Su Yan, making her look indescribably beautiful.

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned and reached to take Su Yan's hand, his heart stirred. "Su Yan..."

Su Yan's face flushed; sensing what he was thinking, she fidgeted and murmured, "Master and the others are waiting outside."

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to check outside and discovered that his acquaintances and friends had long since come upon the news and were waiting outside.

The human, yao, and demon experts had nearly all gathered before the loft; no one spoke, they simply stood and waited.

Yang Kai scratched his head in frustration. Gritting his teeth, he steeled himself and said, “We’ve already waited this long anyway — there’s no need to rush now.”

As he spoke, he transformed into a wolf and pushed Su Yan down onto the ground.

......

The loft door opened. Yang Kai and Su Yan appeared before Ling Taixu and the others.

Everyone hurried forward to ask about their condition; Xia Ningshang's eyes betrayed unsuppressed anxiety and care.

The day Yang Kai and Su Yan had suddenly appeared within the Xuan Realm Pearl with feeble auras and seeming grievously injured, Xia Ningshang had been alarmed and arranged for their recovery while sending the news out.

It was not until more than three months later that the two reappeared.

"Yang Kai, are you alright?" Ling Taixu was the first to ask.

"Grandmaster, your concern is needless. Disciple is now well."

"You little brat, you worried me to death... and your mother!" Fourth Master Yang breathed out, relieved, then, thinking it sounded a bit lacking in manly spirit, hurriedly pushed Dong Suzhu forward to take the spotlight.

Dong Suzhu stood by Fourth Master Yang, biting her lips, her nostrils twitching, tears welling in her eyes; she wanted to cry but held it back.

"Mother, don't worry — I'm fine." Yang Kai grinned and patted his chest to look hearty.

That was the last straw — Dong Suzhu's suppressed emotions burst and she began to cry, tears dropping like a string of pearls.

If not for the many human, yao and demon experts present, she would have rushed forward to hug her precious child and dote on him.

"You little brat!" Fourth Master Yang fumed, glaring at Yang Kai.

"Why are you yelling? Why are you yelling?" Dong Suzhu's little fists pounded Fourth Master Yang's ironlike body. "Why are you yelling at my son!"

Fourth Master Yang scowled, thinking: your son is my son — shouting won't do any harm!

The commotion grew.
