## Chapter 561 — Incomprehensible

Kang Zhan was truly bewildered. Although since the Succession War began, Yang Kai had repeatedly performed astonishing feats that made no one dare underestimate him, Kang Zhan still found it somewhat amusing that Yang Kai suddenly blurted out such an inexplicable statement.

Yang Kai noticed the disbelief on Kang Zhan’s face and said in a low voice, “I don’t have time to explain everything to you. If you trust me, then leave this place immediately. If you don’t, then stay. Your life and death have nothing to do with me!”

With that, he took a step forward.

His movement instantly alarmed the allied forces of the Seven Great Families. Countless strong cultivators quickly gathered their power, all staring at him heavily.

A cold gleam flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes, his expression growing impatient.

“Young Master…” Ye Xinrou suddenly appeared from the crowd, apparently having been informed and rushing over. An impish expression appeared on her delicate face as she said, “Isn’t what you’re saying a bit alarmist? If the people of Cangyun Evil Land really wanted to die, would they dare to leave their own territory and come here?”

“Idiot!” Yang Kai spat venomously. “Ye Xinrou, I know you have a grudge against me, and what I did last time was indeed a bit excessive. But now I don’t want to argue with you, nor do I have the time. Tell your people to step aside, or don’t blame me for being ruthless.”

“Young Master, you look so ferocious that I’m scared,” Ye Xinrou said timidly, then sneered disdainfully. “You say the people of Cangyun Evil Land have attacked, but what proof do you have? Can you show any evidence?”

Yang Kai looked at her coldly but said nothing.

What proof did he have? His proof was only his trust in Shan Qingluo and Bilo! The Golden Feather Eagle had been sent out to scout and still hadn’t returned yet. Even when it did, only Yang Kai would be able to interpret the news it brought back—still only one side of the story.

Seeing his silence, Ye Xinrou scoffed and held out her hands helplessly. “No proof and no basis—how do you expect anyone to believe that? Isn’t this just a trick you’re playing?”

“I have no need for tricks,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “I have already withdrawn from the Succession War. The Yang Family’s headship has nothing to do with me. Whether Eldest Brother or Second Brother wants it, let them take it. Right now, I only want to take my people and leave this place.”

“Heh heh.” Ye Xinrou smiled coquettishly. “Young Master, whether you’ve withdrawn from the Succession War or not, you aren’t going to leave here.”

“Who says I can’t leave?”

“You can try.”

“Don’t push me.”

Yang Kai’s aura turned dangerous.

Ye Xinrou’s smile quickly faded, and she said coldly, “Yang Kai, don’t say you were offered wine but refuse to drink and then force yourself to drink the bitter cup. Although your mansion has powerful experts, don’t forget you’ve made enemies of the Eight Great Families. Your end is foreordained. Do you really think with your abilities you can resist all of Zhongdu? You’re far too arrogant.”

“Sister Ye, now is not the time to argue.” Qiu Yimeng stepped forward. “The people of Cangyun Evil Land have indeed already attacked. Even if there is personal grudge between you, Yang Kai, and me, just wait until after we get through this mess alive, alright?”

“Isn’t this Sister Qiu?” Ye Xinrou pursed her lips and smiled slyly, looking at Qiu Yimeng with mischief. “What, did you stab yourself last night and woke up fully recovered today? Your constitution must be extraordinary, or were you just acting yesterday?”

Qiu Yimeng’s expression suddenly turned ugly.

Ye Xinrou’s shamelessness, acting as if she intended to block everyone from Yang Kai’s mansion here, enraged her. She had hoped to talk to her properly but realized it was like speaking to a brick wall.

Ye Xinrou’s jealousy and hatred toward Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng clouded her judgment.

“I can’t reason with her,” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, a trace of helplessness on his face.

Suddenly, Ye Xinrou shouted coldly, “Everyone in Yang Kai’s mansion, hear this: leave him immediately and pledge allegiance to the Eight Great Families. Forget the past. Otherwise, the Eight Great Families will treat your clans and sects as enemies. You know well what the consequences will be.”

The people behind Yang Kai all changed color.

Ye Xinrou sneered, “Allegiance to the Eight Great Families also has its benefits. If you are willing to stand with me now, I guarantee your clans and sects will prosper… Young Master Liu has a say on this, does he not, Young Master Liu?”

She glanced meaningfully to the side.

Among the crowd, Liu Feisheng stood with a weary expression. Countless eyes from Yang Kai’s mansion swept over him, making him feel a thorn in his back, as if he wanted to find a hole to hide in.

“You fucking Liu family!” Dong Qinghan couldn’t help but curse.

This Young Lord of Tianyuan City had left Yang Kai’s mansion less than an hour ago and had already been swayed by Ye Xinrou.

It was like a slap in Yang Kai’s face in front of everyone.

When he left, Yang Kai had even thanked him for his efforts in Tianyuan City during this time.

Hearing Dong Qinghan’s furious curse, Liu Feisheng’s face flushed and paled repeatedly.

“Is it only Liu Feisheng?” Yang Kai glanced at Ye Xinrou coldly.

Ye Xinrou curled her lips. “The Duanmu Family and Ziwei Valley still have some backbone. They’ve directly left War City, but even one is enough.”

Hearing this, Luo Xiaoman couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. She really feared that her Senior Brother Fan Hong would be swayed by Ye Xinrou’s persuasion and also switch sides.

If that happened, Luo Xiaoman would have no face left to stay.

“Young Master Liu, speak to them. You’ve lived with them for so long and understand them. Say what benefits Tianyuan City got and how you feel now.” Ye Xinrou looked proudly at Yang Kai while giving Liu Feisheng orders.

Liu Feisheng’s expression was extremely troubled, fists clenched tightly. Facing the gazes sent from Yang Kai’s mansion, he felt nearly unable to stand there.

“Young Master… I’m sorry, I have no choice,” Liu Feisheng muttered with guilt.

“No need to apologize. This is your choice,” Yang Kai said slowly, showing little emotion. It seemed he did not mind Liu Feisheng’s rapid betrayal.

Ye Xinrou was stunned, suddenly feeling the frustration of throwing a heavy punch but hitting cotton instead, her face twisting in displeasure.

“You’re wasting your effort. You won’t take anyone from my mansion,” Yang Kai said sternly. “I’ll say it again: get out of the way immediately. We’re leaving. Anyone who dares block us will be slain without mercy!”

“Young Master, what a temper you have,” Ye Xinrou growled through gritted teeth, “Let’s see if you really have the ability!”

Yang Kai’s patience was finally exhausted. He stared coldly at Ye Xinrou and slowly raised one hand.

Suddenly, the True Yuan of everyone in the mansion surged wildly.

“A blasphemer! You dare to lay hands?” An angry shout rang out.

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he turned to look; seven figures swiftly flew over. They were the seven Divine Roaming Masters stationed at Fengshen Hall.

Ling Taixu and the others looked displeased as well.

Although last night’s battle gave them absolute dominance, only one night had passed. Meng Wuya and Earth Demon had yet to fully recover their Yuan Qi. If they fought now, their side might suffer losses.

“Looks like we can’t leave.” Meng Wuya sighed deeply, shaking his head. He hadn’t expected that simply trying to leave War City would be so obstructed.

“Still killing people from the Eight Great Families last night wasn’t enough?” Yang Liting said coldly, looking at Yang Kai with disgust. “Though you are a Yang Family descendant, it seems you no longer respect your bloodline. In that case, you are no longer part of the Yang Family.”

The crowd erupted in shock.

Yang Liting’s words meant expelling Yang Kai from the family.

It was rare for the Eight Great Families to expel their direct descendants. If the news spread, it would shock the entire realm.

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent and composed. “Whether I’m expelled or not, I don’t care. But now I only want to lead my people out. I ask the elders for some leniency.”

“Want to leave?” Another sneered. “You killed so many of the Eight Great Families and think you can just walk away? There’s no such cheap thing in this world.”

The fat elder from the Huo Family frowned. “Yang Kai, don’t be impulsive. Consider things from the family’s perspective. Think about why we treat you this way. You cannot leave now. If you did, how would the Eight Great Families save face?”

Yang Kai took a deep breath. He liked this fat elder—it seemed he had shown goodwill toward him many times, unlike others who often used status and cultivation to threaten him.

“Elders, this place will soon be destroyed. If we don’t leave now, everyone will die here!”

The fat elder looked troubled. “Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen told us this news. We all know. But as the young lady from the Ye Family asked, do you have any proof? This is not something to say lightly.”

Yang Kai shook his head. “I’ll say the same again. Believe me, then prepare to leave immediately. If not, there’s nothing I can do.”

“Alas.” The fat elder sighed. “Saying it like this makes it hard not to suspect other motives.”

“Other motives?” Yang Kai was taken aback, then realized. “You think I’m using this as a pretext to unsettle your minds and escape?”

“Isn’t that what you intend?” One of the seven top experts sneered.

“Heh heh…” Yang Kai smiled helplessly. “I have no such plan. If I wanted to escape, I wouldn’t bother having someone notify you. You all aren’t children. Don’t be so clever that you fool only yourselves!”

“Impertinent!” Yang Liting shouted angrily. “You have no right to lecture us.”

Another said, “Setting aside whether your news is reliable, just regarding its source… You seem to have gotten it from a maid under the Enchantress Queen, right?”

“That’s correct.”

“How dare you! As a descendant of the Eight Great Families, you have ties with the Six Great Evil Kings! This is unforgivable!”

“Why would the Enchantress Queen send someone to inform you? How can the words of these demons be trusted?”

“Your reasoning is full of holes. Do you think we are three-year-olds, easily deceived?”

One after another, shouts of rebuke echoed, even the fat elder showing a trace of disappointment on his face.
