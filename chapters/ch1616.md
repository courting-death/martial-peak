## Chapter 1616 — Vying to Win Over

As the Star Lord, he could indeed freely sense every movement and fluctuation on the Cultivation Star whose Stellar Origin he had refined.

But doing so consumed tremendous spirit and attention; no Star Lord would be so bored as to peek around for no reason—if they had that time and energy, they would be better off cultivating.

Yang Kai naturally knew this, and Xia Ningshang could also be counted as a Star Lord; only her situation was special. With her ability she could perceive conditions across much of the Tongxuan Continent.

Luo Hai, being a Second Stage Void King Realm expert, was far stronger than Xia Ningshang by an unknown margin; sensing what occurred inside the Blood Prison would likely not be difficult for him.

Seeing his expression change, Xu Binbai immediately knew what he feared. He chuckled and said, "Brother Yang, you needn't be so tense. The Domains inside the Blood Prison are extremely potent; even Senior Luo Hai might not be able to perceive it perfectly."

"Not perfectly?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Yes. It is said the Blood Prison contains restrictions set down by the previous generation's Cuiwei Star Star Lord using Stellar Origin power. That previous Star Lord had reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. Since Senior Luo Hai is a Stage lower than that, until his strength can match the previous Star Lord, Senior Luo Hai cannot fathom everything within," Xu Binbai explained.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, his tense expression easing somewhat.

Nevertheless, even after Xu Binbai said that, he still felt uneasy.

The commotion over by Domain Stone Mountain was one thing — the Stone Puppets had been moving stealthily, and even Senior Luo Hai would have no reason to discover it; Yang Kai had no worries about that.

However, the situation over at Yao Hill made him feel that something was amiss.

Chi Yue and the others all knew there was a Void Mind Crystal there; as the Cuiwei Star Star Lord, how could Luo Hai not be aware?

He himself had battled Yao King Feng E at the Yao Hill, and he had taken the Void Mind Crystal for himself...

Had Luo Hai detected this? Yang Kai dared not make a rash judgment, but the Void Mind Crystal was of great importance — something even Chi Yue coveted.

Chi Yue and Luo Hai were of comparable cultivation; if Chi Yue desired it, Luo Hai surely desired it as well!

A thousand thoughts flashed through his mind like lightning. Yang Kai drew a breath, recovered his composure, and casually cast a glance at the golden‑crowned Luo Hai.

The other party was clearly watching him too. When their eyes met, Yang Kai distinctly saw a glint of sharp light flash in Luo Hai's gaze.

Yang Kai's heart sank!

"Eh... what is your relationship with Lord Wudao?" The beautiful woman stepped up to Yang Kai, about to ask him a few things, when she suddenly noticed Xu Binbai standing at his side. Her eyes swept over the three‑petaled flower pattern on his chest and she asked in surprise.

"That is my master!" Xu Binbai replied with composed dignity.

"Lord Wudao is your master?" Li Wanning couldn't help but cover her small mouth, her face full of astonishment.

“What? That youngster is Lord Wudao’s disciple?” The many Void King Realm cultivators who followed behind all cried out in surprise, as though they had stumbled upon something remarkable, and began eyeing Xu Binbai with great interest.

Even Luo Hai — the strongest and highest‑ranked among them — showed a hint of astonishment; evidently he had not expected someone of such background to appear this time in the Blood Prison Trial.

"Xu Binbai pays his respects to the seniors!" Although Xu Binbai was Lord Wudao's disciple, he was after all a junior, and facing so many Void King Realm experts he did not presume. He saluted respectfully.

"No need for such formality, Young Brother."

"Indeed — we're not outsiders, so you needn't be so polite. I, Zhou, had the fortune to meet Lord Wudao five hundred years ago; it was thanks to his guidance that I was enlightened and was able to ascend to the Void King Realm. If one were to count it up, Lord Wudao could be considered half my master — you and I would be senior and junior brothers then." The burly man spoke affably; as a Void King Realm expert he cared little for rank and freely praised Lord Wudao.

"Senior Zhou, you flatter me. What merit have I to call you Brother?" Xu Binbai smiled modestly.

"Good, good — Lord Wudao has successors. You work hard and don't disgrace Lord Wudao's reputation."

"I will bear your teachings in mind, seniors!" Xu Binbai answered respectfully.

"When you see Lord Wudao again, convey my regards to him on my behalf," Luo Hai kindly instructed.

"I will deliver the message!" Xu Binbai nodded. "My master once said that in the future Star Domain, barring accidents, the first to breakthrough to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm will assuredly be Senior Luo Hai."

Upon hearing this, many Void King Realm attendees looked at Luo Hai with reverent eyes, as if receiving such praise from Lord Wudao were the highest honor.

"Is that so?" Luo Hai raised an eyebrow, his face showing pride, and laughed heartily: "If so, I shall not disappoint Lord Wudao's great expectations!"

"I, a junior, hereby wish Senior every success in achieving your goal soon."

"Enough idle talk — do whatever you came here to do." Luo Hai chuckled and, with keen interest, scrutinized Yang Kai.

“How should I address this young brother?” The beautiful woman, Li Wanning, was the first to speak, smiling softly at Yang Kai, her breath fragrant as orchids.

Others also fixed their expectant gazes on him.

"Yang Kai!"

"Yang Kai?" At the sound of the name, many frowned and exchanged glances, slowly shaking their heads to indicate they had never heard of it.

Rising talents from the Origin Returning Realm usually bore some renown, but Yang Kai's name was one they had never heard before.

"Why do I feel like I've heard someone gossip about you before?" Only Elder Jiu wore a pensive expression.

"I don't know, Senior..."

"This is Elder Jiu of the Hengluo Commerce Guild!" The beautiful woman took the initiative to introduce Elder Jiu to Yang Kai.

"Hengluo Commerce Guild?" Yang Kai's mouth twitched. "Then Senior Jiu may have heard it from Xue Yue."

Elder Jiu's eyes brightened and he nodded: "Right, right — it was from the Third Young Master. I remember now: the last time the Third Young Master returned from the Imperial Garden he did mention you. Young Brother, do you know the Third Young Master?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded stiffly.

Not only did he know Xue Yue, that woman wanted him shredded into a thousand pieces...

"What a coincidence!" Elder Jiu was overjoyed. "Someone who lingers in the Third Young Master's thoughts must be extraordinary. Young Brother, would you consider joining my Hengluo Commerce Guild? With your aptitude, you could one day rise to the guild's upper echelons. You surely know the stature of the Hengluo Commerce Guild in the Star Domain, do you not?"

"Hey Elder Jiu — I came first, thank you very much. Isn't this a bit unfair?" Li Wanning felt a bit put out at Elder Jiu's bluntness.

"There's no such thing as first or later in this matter. Quick hands win out!" Elder Jiu laughed and continued to coax Yang Kai. "Young Brother, the Third Young Master seldom remembers anyone. I have some knowledge of your talent and strength; if you join my Hengluo Commerce Guild, I can vouch for you. I'll give you..."

Elder Jiu offered a string of tempting terms. Nearby cultivators all breathed rapidly, gazing at Yang Kai with envy and jealousy, itching to step forward and beg Elder Jiu to take them into the guild.

"Don't listen to him — Hengluo Commerce Guild isn't so special." Li Wanning sneered, then her bright eyes fixed on Yang Kai: "Young Brother, if you agree to join our Purple Star, Elder Jiu's offers will be matched in full. We can also arrange a Void King Realm expert to personally guide your cultivation. If you don't mind, I can instruct you myself. How about it?"

"Both of you, stop spouting nonsense," the old woman surnamed Lei interjected, planting her dragon‑headed cane to the ground. She looked at Yang Kai and said, "Young Brother, join our Sword Alliance. We welcome fresh young blood; if you agree now, this token will be yours!"

As she spoke, a dark token suddenly appeared in her hand.

The token was neither metal nor jade; its material was unknown. On it was a sword‑shaped emblem, and a faint, cutting aura emanated from it.

"A Sword Alliance elder token!" Someone who knew its value inhaled sharply, their eyes burning as they looked at it.

"No way — this is the Sword Alliance elder token? One can become a Sword Alliance elder at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm?"

"Senior Lei truly is bold. The entire Sword Alliance seems to have only ten Great Elders, each one a towering figure."

"With this elder token, one could mobilize a large portion of the Sword Alliance's people, funds, and resources. Future cultivation concerns would be gone."

"What on earth does this kid have that makes so many experts vie to recruit him?"

The gathered cultivators were a mix of envy, jealousy, and bewilderment.

Nobody could understand why these Void King Realm experts would ignore so many Third Stage Origin Returning Realm figures and instead expend such effort to invite a Second Stage Origin Returning Realm practitioner.

"Nobody could be worse than him, right?" they thought, a rising sense of indignation and refusal to concede swelling within them.

The three great forces each put forth their offers, and other Void King Realm experts, unwilling to be left behind, one by one attempted to pull Yang Kai into their folds, each appearing utterly sincere.

Only one loner, an elderly Void King Realm cultivator, remained unmoved — he had come only to purchase Domain Stones.

"I understand what you seniors mean." After they finished speaking, Yang Kai then nodded solemnly.

He had not expected that, having just emerged from the Blood Prison, he would attract such attention; these Void King Realm experts were here only to recruit him into their forces.

Each person's manner was cordial and their expressions extremely sincere.

Yet the more so, the more uneasy Yang Kai felt inside.

They were so enthusiastic in their invitations that they clearly knew of his performance inside the Blood Prison — otherwise, why behave this way?

And the reason they could know was entirely because of Luo Hai!

This was no place to linger. Yang Kai resolved in secret that once Qian Tong advanced successfully, he would immediately find an opportunity to leave Cuiwei Star.

"Since you understand, have you made a decision?" Li Wanning asked anxiously.

From Luo Hai they had come to fully appreciate Yang Kai's excellence. Throughout history, those at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm who entered the Blood Prison and emerged unscathed were virtually nonexistent — Yang Kai was the first.

That alone was enough to recruit him; moreover, with their eyes they could also tell Yang Kai possessed some extraordinary abilities.

He was absolutely a genius among geniuses; nobody wanted to miss out.
