## Chapter 1054 — Pills Are Hard to Refine

When Yang Kai burst into the valley, the old man who was refining pills detected him at once; the gaunt figure couldn't help furrowing his brow as a terrifying power welled up within his emaciated body, making one's heart grow cold.

This valley was the forbidden ground of the entire Rainfall Star; no one was allowed to approach, and no one dared. Yet today that peace was disturbed by a reckless brat who did not know his place.

Anger flared in his heart and he had no intention of letting the matter rest—he meant to take Yang Kai's life on the spot, to use his death as a warning to others about the fate of those who disturb the quiet of his alchemical work.

Someone as insignificant as Yang Kai was beneath his consideration.

But just as he prepared to move, one of the pill furnaces arranged around him suddenly emitted an odd sound. The old man's expression turned bitter; he sent a surge of Saint Yuan into the furnace to steady the chaotic concoction within and muttered, "Pills are hard to refine, damn it—fine, I'll let you live for a moment, but I won't let you ruin a whole good batch. Damn it, pills are truly hard to refine!"

He muttered to himself as his hands continued to shift through alchemical formations, pouring his Saint Yuan into one furnace after another. The Spatial Ring on his hand shimmered; one prepared herb after another was cast into the furnaces, each quantity, each flame, each moment precise to the tiniest degree.

More and more furnaces issued noises, yet the old man's face remained calm, free of any panic; only the speed of his hands quickened considerably.

Half an hour later, a gleam flashed in the old man's sunken eyes. At that instant all the furnaces hummed together, emitting a series of crisp sounds as a thick pill fragrance drifted through the air.

He waved his hand and dozens of furnaces, great and small, all opened. Pill after pill, varied in size and color yet brimming with Spiritual Qi, flew out and fell like raindrops into several jade bottles nearby.

Clink, clink—sweet, pleasing sounds rang out as three jade bottles were filled to the brim.

The old man showed no trace of fatigue; if anything he seemed excited. Rubbing his dry, gnarled hands, he hurried to the jade bottles and picked them up, carefully inspecting each freshly made pill.

"No... no... still no..." he muttered after inspecting each one, and the expectant look on his face slowly drained away into increasing disappointment.

Even after nearly forty pills from the three bottles had been checked, he still could not find what he sought.

As if struck by some great blow, a touch of despondency surfaced on the old man's face. He heaved a heavy sigh: "Pills are really hard to refine—why are there no Pill Patterns? Could my method of relying on quantity be wrong? It shouldn't be!"

Saying this, he casually tossed the jade bottles aside, as though discarding something worthless, without even glancing back.

In the corner of that room dozens upon dozens of jade bottles were piled up—no fewer than a hundred, each filled to the brim with pills. The pills in every bottle were no lower than Saint King-Grade; among them there were even Origin-Grade pills.

The old man sat down, sorrowful, reflecting on the gains and losses of his alchemical work, searching for the root cause of why Pill Patterns had not formed, scratching at his already sparse white hair until it grew even thinner.

He remained there for three days and three nights, motionless like a corpse. Only those eyes, shifting with uncertain light, revealed deep contemplation.

Suddenly, a faint energy fluctuation came from the outer medicinal fields, interrupting his thoughts. He frowned displeased and lifted his gaze toward the fields.

Then he recalled that three days ago an uninvited guest had come here—at the time he had no time to deal with the matter, and later he simply forgot about the youth.

"Still not gone?" the old man said with a look of surprise. He quietly released his Divine Sense outward to probe, and the next moment he uttered a slight sound of interest, as if he had discovered something exceedingly intriguing, and began to pay attention to Yang Kai's movements.

In the medicinal fields, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his Divine Sense spreading in all directions like a tide.

Threads of Divine Sense, one after another, penetrated into every inch of soil in the fields, probing the hidden wonders of those plots.

These plots were not randomly cultivated; the ridges and rows were arranged to correspond with the mysteries of spirit formations—each patch of field was a different spirit formation which, by its power, gathered Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth to promote the growth of the Spiritual Herbs and Spiritual Medicine within, shortening their natural growth cycles.

A herb planted here for fifty years could attain a medicinal age of a hundred years or more.

Yang Kai had no idea who had arranged such a thing, but it should be the owner of the palace—the alchemist hidden inside.

He poured himself into the study of the fields, deciphering the spirit formations concealed within, utterly absorbed and oblivious to all else.

Yang Kai had learned many spirit formations by gleaning them from the True Alchemy Formula; on the Tongxuan Continent these formations had already given his alchemy great aid.

Yet the True Alchemy Formula was after all only a product of the Tongxuan Continent.

The Star Domain likewise had spirit formations unique to its realm.

Each had its strengths and weaknesses. Yang Kai compared the hidden formations in the fields with those he already knew, discarding the useless and keeping the refined, and reaped huge benefits.

Seeing this, the old man within the palace at once understood what Yang Kai was up to. He thought for a moment, suppressed his murderous intent, and let out a light laugh: "Fine, go on—you're a promising talent!"

He recalled the hardships of his own days of studying alchemy.

To learn each different spirit formation he had traversed countless mountains and waters, sought out renowned masters, and often suffered scorn; being turned away at the door was commonplace, being driven out happened regularly.

Those exceptional alchemists guarded the formations they mastered as treasures and rarely passed them on. Even when teaching disciples many would not reveal everything; let alone someone who came seeking instruction like he was.

When he had been as young as Yang Kai he too had been obsessed with alchemy, vowing to carve his own path in the art and earn the world's regard.

But now he knew that his youthful thinking had been wrong. Alchemy was not a study to change how the world viewed you; it was a pursuit for life.

Yang Kai's earnest concentration stirred memories of his past in the old man, and his resolve to kill the youth faded. He no longer bothered with him and allowed him to pry into the mysteries of the medicinal fields.

Time flowed on. The old man inside the palace began refining pills, as always—dozens of furnaces operating in concert, herb after herb thrown in.

Outside the palace Yang Kai resembled a meditating monk, a thick layer of dust coating him as he hungrily delved into those spirit formations.

An old man and a young one — unrelated to each other, each engrossed in his own work, each wholly absorbed in his own focus.

After each period of refining the old man would glance out to observe Yang Kai and, upon finding him still there, felt a measure of admiration for the boy's patience and perseverance.

Youth brims with Qi and blood; few can remain utterly focused on a single task. That the lad could was commendable.

Yang Kai could also feel that the palace owner would from time to time sweep his Divine Sense over here, but since he did not drive him off he sat on shamelessly.

He intended to visit the owner in person to offer thanks once he had finished studying the formations here.

He had not come with the deliberate intent to pilfer teachings—only curiosity had led him to linger.

Tranquility continued. One day, as Yang Kai was probing the concealed uses of a particular spirit formation in a plot and comparing it with his prior study, a sudden alarm rose in his chest; an uneasy sensation swelled from the depths of his heart.

He opened his eyes and cast his Divine Sense about to investigate.

Soon his brow knit, for he could detect no danger approaching; within hundreds of miles about him, aside from himself, only the palace owner remained—there was not even a bird in flight.

He supposed it might be a false impression and prepared to settle back into study, yet the sense of unease only deepened.

It was as if his life were being threatened, as though he was about to die at any moment.

He sprang to his feet, his expression as calm and stern as still water.

At his level, his senses were extremely acute; such unease and warning could not arise without cause. There could only be two possibilities.

Either a powerful expert lay hidden nearby, waiting to take his life, or some other reason made his safety precarious.

The former seemed unlikely.

Though he did not know precisely the cultivation of the palace owner, he could be certain the man was a master; if a strong expert were lying in ambush nearby, the palace owner would not fail to notice.

Moreover, Yang Kai thought no one would deliberately target him—he had incurred no enmity in this time and had no cause to be singled out.

The only one who bore grievance, Xue Yue, was bound by the Soul Chain and had grown fond of him; she would protect him rather than lash out.

Thinking of Xue Yue and the Soul Chain, Yang Kai's face shifted as a suspicion rose in his mind.

Could something have happened to Xue Yue?

Because their lives were linked by the Soul Chain, if Xue Yue were in mortal peril it would very likely affect him as well.

The more he considered it, the more plausible it seemed. He dared not delay and immediately rode the Star Shuttle toward the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch.

He cursed inwardly—he had assumed Xue Yue was strong enough and accompanied by Halika, that Origin Returning Realm expert, so she should be safe. He had been dealing with his own matters in peace, yet now something had happened; the thought made him furious.

"Left already?" the old man glanced toward the direction Yang Kai had taken, slowly shook his head, and paid it no further heed.

To him, Yang Kai's arrival was merely a pebble tossed into his unchanging life; the ripples it caused could not touch him. Whether Yang Kai stayed or left meant nothing to him.

He resumed his focus on the dozens of pill furnaces beside him, shifting hand seals and formations, pouring wave after wave of Saint Yuan into each to master their precise tempering.
