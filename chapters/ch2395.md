## Chapter 2395 — The Pavilion Master Summons

“Spatial Force!” Pang Guang’s eyes narrowed as he stared at Yang Kai in shock.

That strange power just now was definitely a fluctuation of spatial force, and it was an extremely profound one at that.

This brat actually understands spatial force? He can even teleport others away directly? How could a Dao Origin Realm cultivator reach such an attainment?

Before Pang Guang could think it through, Yang Kai’s Myriad Sword, its sword light surging, had already slashed toward him. This strike contained Yang Kai’s lifetime of cultivation. Even someone like Pang Guang, an Emperor Realm master, couldn’t help but change expression. With a wave of his hand, he summoned a defensive Secret Treasure shaped like a jade butterfly.

Boom…

A tremendous sound rang out. The already crumbling cave mansion’s barrier finally collapsed completely under this blow. Without the protection of the formation, violent energy scattered in all directions, and Yang Kai’s cave mansion was instantly leveled to the ground.

Swish, swish…

Two figures shot out of the cave mansion one after another, facing each other from a distance.

Pang Guang’s eyes were bloodshot as he growled, “Brat, how dare you play me!”

Yang Kai would rather swallow the Butian Lotus whole like a cow chewing peonies than hand it over. This pained Pang Guang to the extreme.

Yang Kai sneered dismissively, “So what if I played you? If you’ve got the guts, come fight me!”

“This Lord will tear you apart!” Pang Guang roared in fury.

Yang Kai flicked his hair, standing motionless in midair, completely unfazed by the threat. He said coolly, “City Lord Pang, you’d better consider your own situation!”

At these words, Pang Guang’s face changed dramatically. After glancing around, his mood instantly soured.

Earlier, while hiding in Yang Kai’s cave mansion, no one could find him. But after this commotion, the entire Tongtian City’s cultivators had been alarmed.

Martial artists from the surrounding cave mansions came out to investigate, and countless others were converging from all directions.

Among them, there were two auras Pang Guang especially dreaded. It was these two who had previously joined forces to injure him, forcing him to hide in Yang Kai’s cave mansion to recover. Now, sensing their approach, Pang Guang had no intention of lingering. He shot Yang Kai a vicious glare and turned to flee toward the city outskirts.

Not long after Pang Guang left, Yang Kai’s cave mansion was surrounded layer upon layer by martial artists, all pointing and discussing, unsure what had happened to cause such a commotion.

With two soft swishes, two people suddenly descended from the sky. Both exuded an imposing aura that made others avert their eyes, and the powerful fluctuations around them revealed that both were First Stage Emperor Realm cultivators.

Yang Kai grew wary, sweeping his gaze over the two.

From the nearby whispers, Yang Kai learned that one was the Pavilion Master of Xuanyun Pavilion, the other was the President of the Free Assembly. These two organizations were powerful on the island mainly because they had Emperor Realm masters as their backing.

Clearly, these two had sensed Pang Guang’s aura and rushed over. Observing them, Yang Kai noticed faint signs of hidden injuries, suggesting they hadn’t fared well when fighting Pang Guang earlier.

“Where is he?” The Xuanyun Pavilion Master’s gaze swept the area, landing on Yang Kai as he asked in a deep voice.

Yang Kai hurriedly pointed in the direction Pang Guang had fled and called out, “He ran that way! Sirs, please uphold justice for me! That thief hid in my cave mansion and, while I was unprepared…”

Before Yang Kai could finish, the two First Stage Emperor Realm masters sped off like the wind. They had no interest in upholding justice for Yang Kai; what interested them were the cultivation resources Pang Guang carried. If not for that, even together they wouldn’t have wanted to provoke someone at the Emperor Realm.

Once the two had disappeared, Yang Kai turned, landed on the ground, grabbed Liu Qianyun, and urged in a low voice, “Let’s go!”

With such a commotion, and even his own cave mansion destroyed, the City Lord’s mansion would surely send people to investigate. If questioned, there would be many things he couldn’t explain.

Why would an Emperor Realm master hide in your cave mansion? How did you survive being ambushed by one? Yang Kai didn’t want to explain, nor could he.

So now, he could only leave this troublesome place as quickly as possible.

Sure enough, less than thirty breaths after Yang Kai left, experts from the City Lord’s mansion hurried over. After asking around, they couldn’t figure out who the owner of the destroyed cave mansion was and could only leave helplessly.

At Ice Heart Pavilion, Yang Kai brought Liu Qianyun straight inside.

“Oh, Pillmaster Yang!” Fan Xin greeted Yang Kai with a delighted smile. “You’re done with your business?”

“Yes, thank you for your concern.” Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

Just as Fan Xin was about to say more, her expression suddenly changed. “Pillmaster Yang, you’re injured!”

Having been ambushed by Pang Guang earlier, Yang Kai had escaped by luck but was still badly hurt, looking quite disheveled now.

“Ran into some trouble,” Yang Kai said awkwardly. “I came here hoping to take shelter for a while. I wonder if…”

Fan Xin glanced at him thoughtfully. “That commotion in the cave mansion district just now—was it related to you, Pillmaster Yang?”

Yang Kai gave a wry smile. “A disaster out of nowhere!”

Fan Xin was stunned. She had only guessed casually, not expecting to be right, and couldn’t help but laugh and cry. In the inner city, few dared to cause trouble, especially in the cave mansion district. Yang Kai must have had quite an ordeal to end up in such a sorry state.

“Junior Sister Fan Xin, if it’s inconvenient, we can leave now,” Yang Kai said, seeing she hadn’t let them in and thinking she was afraid of trouble, feeling a bit down.

Fan Xin covered her mouth with a smile. “Here in Ice Heart Pavilion, no trouble is ever truly trouble. You’re already our Pillmaster—where else would you go? Come with me.”

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up and he cupped his fists. “Thank you, Junior Sister Fan Xin.”

Once inside Ice Heart Pavilion, Yang Kai finally relaxed. Though the place was small and not particularly high-end, it had experts in residence, making it even safer than the cave mansion district. Living here, there was nothing to worry about.

Fan Xin led Yang Kai inside, arranged for him and Liu Qianyun to stay, and then left.

Though Yang Kai’s injuries looked serious, his physique was extraordinary, so he recovered quickly. But instead of focusing on healing, he took out another pitch-black Butian Lotus from the Xuan Realm Pearl.

The Butian Lotus came as twin stalks, one black and one white. A single stalk could only repair a cultivator’s Dantian and Divine Soul—not too heaven-defying. But if the twin stalks were refined into a pill, they could greatly expand a cultivator’s Dantian and Sea of Consciousness.

This effect was extraordinary for any cultivator. Even those at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm couldn’t resist such temptation. The expansion of the Sea of Consciousness and Dantian meant a direct increase in strength.

Earlier, forced by circumstances, Yang Kai had swallowed one Butian Lotus whole. Now only the other remained, so he couldn’t refine the Twin Butian Pill anymore.

He simply decided to swallow the black Butian Lotus as well.

Not only that, he also took out various auxiliary herbs from his Spatial Ring and swallowed them all at once—these were all needed to refine the Twin Butian Pill.

Refining the Twin Butian Pill was now impossible. He could only use this method to maximize the effect of the twin Butian Lotus, using his body as a furnace, Origin Qi as fire, and merging the world’s essence, hoping to gain some of the pill’s effects.

Though this wasted a lot of herbs, he had no other choice.

Pure medicinal power exploded in his belly, turning into energy that coursed through his body. Cracking sounds echoed in the secret room as Yang Kai focused his mind, undisturbed, refining everything with all his heart.

He could feel his Dantian and Sea of Consciousness slowly expanding—the wondrous effects of the twin Butian Lotus were manifesting.

Three days passed in a flash. Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, looking refreshed and full of gains.

Sensing his condition, he found his injuries fully healed. Not only that, but his Dantian seemed to have expanded by a tenth compared to three days ago, and his Sea of Consciousness had grown greatly as well.

At his level, any progress was hard-won, requiring great effort and luck. Yet now, just by consuming two Butian Lotuses, he had gained so much—proof of their incredible power.

After rejoicing for a while, Yang Kai gritted his teeth and cursed, “Pang Guang, you old bastard!”

If Pang Guang hadn’t forced him, he would never have swallowed the Butian Lotus whole. Thinking about it now, his heart still ached. The Butian Lotus was rare, and he’d originally planned to refine the Twin Butian Pill. Now that plan was ruined.

Compared to refining it into a pill, swallowing the Butian Lotus like this didn’t even bring out a tenth of its effects. As an alchemist, Yang Kai could hardly tolerate such waste.

He held this grudge against Pang Guang.

Just as he was stewing over this, a knock suddenly sounded at the door.

Yang Kai was startled, but quickly opened the door.

Fan Xin stood at the entrance, looking at him with a strange expression.

Yang Kai asked, “Junior Sister Fan Xin, is something the matter?”

Fan Xin replied, “Master wants to see you.”

“Master?” Yang Kai frowned, then his eyes widened in surprise. “The Pavilion Master?”

“Yes. I was sent by Master to bring you over,” Fan Xin nodded.

Yang Kai suddenly felt uneasy. He never expected the elusive Ice Heart Pavilion Master to summon him at this moment. She was a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. Although Yang Kai had long wanted to meet her and ask about the exit, the sudden summons left him anxious, unsure what she wanted with him.
