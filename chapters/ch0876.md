## Chapter 876 — I Know Who She Is Now

After extracting Zhang Ao's memories about the starry sky, Yang Kai directly refined his soul energy.

He absorbed the insights and understanding Zhang Ao had gained about the Dao of Heaven and martial cultivation.

His own temperament and cultivation improved subtly, though not dramatically.

As Yang Kai's power rose, the benefits gained from refining a dead person's soul energy grew ever smaller. Still, by using this method he would never have to worry about hitting a plateau in cultivation: at the right moments he could slay high-level martial artists and draw on their comprehension, allowing his progress to continue unimpeded—provided his physical strength could keep pace.

With Yang Kai's current temperamental cultivation, there would be no obstacle to reaching the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Retracting his spirit, Yang Kai rose slowly. Just as he was about to step outside to take a look, Han Fei's sharp shout rang out not far away: "Who's there?"

In the next instant a bone-chilling cold spread through the air; the rustle of trailing robes came to his ears as if Han Fei had given chase.

Yang Kai frowned and stepped from the tent, seeing a number of Ancient Demon Clan members gathered and pointing toward a direction.

"Master!" Li Rong hurried over. Her tent stood beside Yang Kai's, no more than five zhang away, placed there to protect him.

"What happened?" Yang Kai asked, sending out his divine sense to probe the situation.

"Someone's been spying on us the last few days, but we couldn't find out who. Commander Han Fei must have sensed it and gave chase," Li Rong reported.

"Even you didn't notice?" Yang Kai said in surprise.

"Mm. That person's concealment is extraordinarily strong—seeming to vanish entirely, as if they didn't exist at all," Li Rong's brows drew into a thin line.

"That's interesting." Yang Kai grinned. Though Li Rong was only at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, she fought like a demon general. If even she couldn't detect the intruder, what sort of being could it be?

Only a Great Yao Lord among the nearby forces could accomplish such concealment!

But Yang Kai had already struck a deal with that Great Lord; he wouldn't turn traitorous, nor would he bother to spy on them for sport.

They waited on the spot for a time. Han Fei returned, her face cold.

"Did you catch them?" Li Rong asked.

Han Fei shook her head. "They were fast, with exquisite footwork—I couldn't catch up!"

"Could you see what they looked like?" Yang Kai asked.

"A woman," Han Fei said, frowning. "Oddly, her clothes were torn, her hair disheveled, like a madwoman. She didn't speak—when I spotted her she immediately fled. Oh, and I couldn't sense any life from her; instead there was... a deathly aura."

"A deathly aura?" Li Rong exclaimed.

"Yes—death aura. Like the breath of one who has died," Han Fei said solemnly.

Yang Kai's expression shifted. His figure flickered, leaving several afterimages before he halted and asked, "Was her movement like this?"

Han Fei nodded repeatedly. "Yes, exactly that sort of movement—strange."

"Then I know who she is." Yang Kai gazed into the distance and sighed softly.

The Ancient Demon Clan leaders exchanged glances, puzzled by the shadow of melancholy that had crossed Yang Kai's face.

"Master, is that woman an old acquaintance of yours?" Li Rong asked cautiously.

Yang Kai shook his head. "I don't know her personally. But she is connected to me—she was the previous Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land."

He proceeded to recount the story of Saintess Nan, and the Ancient Demon Clan listened in astonishment.

"In life she killed no one; in death she slaughters millions..." Li Rong mused. "She's somewhat like Senior Coffin-Servant, yet entirely the opposite!"

Coffin-Servant and Saintess Nan were both living dead—one had slaughtered countless lives in life, the other had never taken a life. Both were bound by obsession, so even after death their corpses followed the will they had in life.

Because they were undead, no life fluctuations leaked from them, which was why Li Rong and the others couldn't detect it.

To deal with such a being, you either destroy the body outright or shatter the will that sustained her in life; once that will is broken, the dead flesh will cease moving.

"She needs handling," Yang Kai said calmly.

Saintess Nan had belonged to a Sacred Land; leaving her be could trigger trouble like what had happened a few years prior.

It would also threaten the stability of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Now that she had appeared here, she was likely targeting him. If he acted as bait, following her instinctual patterns, Saintess Nan would surely show herself again.

After telling the leaders his plan, none objected.

For safety Yang Kai took Li Rong and Han Fei with him and pushed deeper into the forest.

Saintess Nan still possessed the strength of the Second Stage of the Saint Realm—she could not be underestimated.

They traveled a hundred li before stopping in a valley. Yang Kai paused, glanced around, and nodded slightly.

Li Rong and Han Fei concealed themselves and laid their traps.

Yang Kai wandered the valley searching for heaven-and-earth treasures, but after a long time only found some Heaven-Grade Mystery-Grade herbs—no Spirit-Grade material.

After circling the valley, a faint unease prickled Yang Kai.

It felt as if a pair of eyes watched him from the void.

Turning sharply toward that direction, he saw Saintess Nan in white, her hair disheveled, like a terrifying specter, staring at him without moving.

Her white robes were torn from many battles and had never been changed, making her look all the more ghastly.

Yang Kai couldn't tell when she had appeared or how long she'd been watching him, but he sensed a flicker of tenderness and longing in her gaze as it fell upon the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring on his hand.

The Saint Lord's Spirit Ring was the symbol of each Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; the old Saint Lord had worn it in life. Saintess Nan had been the old Saint Lord's woman, so it was natural that the ring stirred unusual emotions in her.

Those feelings of tenderness and longing in her eyes were soon replaced by ferocity; without a word she glided toward Yang Kai like a phantom.

Before she reached him, oppressive force had already washed over them.

A long sword materialized in midair and swung down toward Yang Kai's head.

Profound Heaven Sword!

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and made no move to dodge.

"Ice and snow!" a melodious cry rang out from the side.

In an instant the valley's temperature plunged. The plants were coated in a thin sheet of ice and a faint blue barrier shimmered overhead.

The change in climate even made snowflakes fall from the sky.

Each flake carried terrifying potency; as they drifted down they burst into light, transforming into countless thin, sharp attacks that enveloped Saintess Nan.

The Profound Heaven Sword shattered on impact.

Saintess Nan's assault stalled as she instinctively raised the Vast Heaven Shield to protect herself, and a spear of divine light appeared in her hand and was hurled toward Han Fei's hidden position.

Whoosh...

The Heaven-Slaying Spear seemed to have pierced space itself and in an instant reached before Han Fei, growing enormous in her vision.

A chill rose from her heart. Demon marks crawled across Han Fei's delicate face as she reached out and precisely seized the spear's tip with her slender hand.

Drops of dark red blood trickled from her fingertips.

At the same time, Li Rong silently arrived behind Saintess Nan. A burst of red light bloomed and a gigantic flower sprang up beneath the saintess's feet.

The blossom opened in splendid beauty, spinning like a lotus platform and emitting strange ripples that tugged at Saintess Nan's body.

The surrounding petals folded inward, attempting to envelop her.

With a hoarse, terrifying roar Saintess Nan left behind an afterimage and then reappeared a short distance away.

Her murky eyes fixed on Li Rong and Han Fei with a savage, caged-beast fury.

Li Rong and Han Fei gathered together and regarded Saintess Nan with a mixture of pity and dread, realizing how troublesome she was.

"Don't hold back—bind her as much as possible. If you can't bind her... kill her outright!" Yang Kai ordered coolly.

"Yes!" Li Rong and Han Fei answered in unison and unleashed their earth-shattering methods again.

Hiss... hiss... hiss...

Ice shards shot out.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

A whirl of crimson petals danced.

With the two Ancient Demon Clan commanders combining forces against a Second Stage Saint, there was no contest.

Han Fei's barrier enclosed the valley; Saintess Nan could not flee.

Were it not for respect that she still belonged to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Li Rong and Han Fei would have already smashed her to pieces.

Half an hour later Saintess Nan was driven to the brink and was finally wrapped in the flower produced by Li Rong.

A dazzling red light flared. When the glow faded, the blossom seemed to have imprinted itself inside Saintess Nan, leaving a small flower-shaped mark on her face.

Her True Yuan was sealed and her movements blocked; Saintess Nan could not stir.

Stepping forward for a closer look at the woman who had plagued him for years, Yang Kai felt conflicted.

In youth she must have been a peerless beauty—inside and out—so lovely that even in death her face had not aged.

But now she was neither fully human nor fully ghost.

If the old Saint Lord were still alive, Yang Kai wondered how he would react to this scene.

Frankly, if Su Yan or Xia Ningshang had been turned into this, Yang Kai would die without peace.

He had planned to destroy her outright, but standing there he found he could not bring himself to do it, and after a moment's hesitation he commanded, "Take her back and watch her closely."

He decided to hand Saintess Nan over to Xu Hui and his people to deal with.

Li Rong and Han Fei exchanged a glance and nodded, the former carrying Saintess Nan as they followed Yang Kai back along the original path.
