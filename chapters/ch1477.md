## Chapter 1477 — One Vacancy

"Mm, that's good." After learning of Shen Shitao's recent condition, Yang Kai put his mind at ease.

"Sect Master Yang, how did you come to be here?" Mo Yu asked, looking at Yang Kai with a face full of suspicion.

"Ill fortune!" Yang Kai gave a wry smile and briefly recounted what had happened to him since he left; Gu Zhen and Mo Yu listened and were full of emotion.

Come to think of it, Mo Yu, Gu Zhen and the others had been rather lucky when they emerged from the Imperial Garden — they happened to appear near Qiantian Sect, so they returned to the sect without much trouble.

"This trip to the Imperial Garden was truly unexpected. I never imagined that this forbidden ground would be open to the whole Star Domain, and our Dark Star suffered heavy losses," Gu Zhen sighed deeply.

"Oh? Which powers suffered losses?" Yang Kai's interest was immediately piqued.

"I can't be certain yet, but since my return I've been probing for information; it's said that the Demon Blood Sect's Great Elder and the Sect Master both perished in the Imperial Garden."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, his expression calm.

Those two from the Demon Blood Sect were precisely the ones he had personally struck down; he naturally understood the circumstances better than anyone.

Gu Zhen and the others did not suspect anything; they assumed the Demon Blood Sect's two experts had encountered masters from other cultivation stars in the Imperial Garden and thus perished. He continued, "Besides them, Leitai Sect's great elder Cheng Pengxuan also perished; Mo Xiaosheng of the Battle Sky Alliance was grievously wounded but escaped with his life; Gong Xinghe of the Liuli Sect did not return; other powers likewise suffered losses to varying degrees. That Qiantian Sect managed to come through unscathed is truly a matter of luck."

“Even Cheng Pengxuan and Gong Xinghe are dead?” Yang Kai was greatly shocked.

"Yes. Although the news hasn't spread, it is true," Gu Zhen said gravely. Yang Kai had no cause to doubt it — between these great powers they place pawns in each other's camps, so gleaning such information was possible.

"What about Yingyue Hall? How are Qian Tong, Fei Zhi Tu, Wei Guchang and the others?" Yang Kai asked, slightly anxious.

"Sect Master Yang needn't be anxious; they are all fine," Mo Yu smiled faintly. "Old Qian is extremely shrewd — they never ventured deep into the Imperial Garden this time. They were merely probing from outside."

"I see." Yang Kai breathed out. He admired Qian Tong's caution — not that Qian was timid, but without Wei Guchang present he and Fei Zhi Tu would surely have seized the chance to go deeper into the Imperial Garden. With Wei Guchang along, however, they dared not. Their reluctance to delve into the Imperial Garden was surely for Wei Guchang's sake.

It was precisely that caution which spared Qian Tong and the others from loss. Even experts like Cheng Pengxuan and Gong Xinghe perished within. No matter how strong Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were, they too could have met the same fate.

Though the opening of the Imperial Garden yielded great gains for many, it also inflicted severe losses on numerous sects; prior to entering, no one expected this expedition to be so perilous.

Had the truth been known earlier, fewer would have rushed there.

"Compared to other cultivation stars, our Dark Star still lags behind. Because of the suppression of the heavenly laws we cannot perceive the mysteries of the Void King Realm; we have pushed our exploration of the Origin Returning Realm to the utmost, but without guidance from Void King Realm experts our secret treasures and spiritual pills fall slightly short of those outside, and when contending with them we always feel somewhat constrained," Gu Zhen sighed.

"Indeed; if our Dark Star could also produce Void King Realm experts, this situation likely would not have occurred," Mo Yu nodded in agreement.

"That may be, but how easy is it to advance to the Void King Realm?" Lü Xuan's expression darkened as he slowly shook his head. "In these tens of thousands of years, our Dark Star has not produced a Void King Realm expert. The last time in Flowing Flame Sandland a Red Candle Fruit appeared; as far as I know, Old Fellow Tang of Piaomiao Hall obtained a part of the Red Candle Fruit and consumed it, but he gained nothing — that excellent spirit fruit was wasted."

"Not only Old Fellow Tang; the Liuli Sect also obtained a part of the Red Candle Fruit — Gong Xinghe consumed and refined it, and still it had no effect, otherwise he would not have perished this time."

"Actually, there are ways to breakthrough to the Void King Realm," Mo Yu mused. "Our Dark Star is suppressed by heavenly law, but if we can leave the Dark Star and go to other cultivation stars whose conditions are favorable, naturally there will be opportunities to break through to the Void King Realm."

Hearing this, Gu Zhen and Lü Xuan were both visibly startled.

Yang Kai glanced at the three and suddenly chuckled, "Elders, there's no need to beat around the bush — you may speak plainly."

Yang Kai's bluntness made Mo Yu and the others look awkward. After a long moment Mo Yu cleared his throat, "It's like this, Yang Kai — we actually wanted to ask whether you plan to use your sect's Void King-Grade warship to voyage afar?"

Sure enough!

Yang Kai smiled knowingly; having heard the three exchange words about the Void King Realm earlier he had guessed as much, and when they tested the waters he immediately saw through their intention.

They were clearly hoping to hitch a ride out of the Dark Star to other cultivation stars to probe the mysteries of the Void King Realm.

That is only natural.

"What if I said... I do have that idea?" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

The three of them brightened instantly, their eyes full of hope.

"Not only do I have that plan, but I might be doing it soon," Yang Kai said, to their surprise.

“Is that true?” Mo Yu shot to his feet, while Gu Zhen and Lü Xuan both revealed looks of excitement.

"It is." Yang Kai said solemnly, nodding.

"Wonderful, wonderful!" Mo Yu murmured twice, then rubbed his hands together and, fidgeting, looked at Yang Kai. "Sect Master Yang, now that matters have come to this, I won't beat around the bush — may I ask how many people that warship can carry?"

"Dozens of people should be no problem."

Mo Yu's eyes lit up; he bit his lip and said in a low voice, "Could Qiantian Sect take two... no, one slot?"

Gu Zhen and Lü Xuan looked on expectantly. Gu Zhen said, "Of course — we will not occupy such a precious slot for nothing; we can provide an appropriate price."

"Will one be enough?" Yang Kai asked, somewhat surprised as he looked at them.

"One is sufficient," Gu Zhen said gravely, nodding. "If possible, we would of course hope that more could leave the Dark Star, but if all the masters departed Qiantian Sect would be left undefended and vulnerable to scoundrels. Besides, advancement to the Void King Realm is not so easy; one slot for a try is sufficient."

"If that's the case, then I can agree." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Hearing this, the three from Qiantian Sect were overjoyed. As for who would receive the slot, that was Qiantian Sect's headache; Yang Kai need not concern himself.

Afterwards Yang Kai told them that when he actually intended to use the warship to leave the Dark Star he would send word to notify them, and asked them to wait patiently — the three had no objections.

There was no further talk that night. On the next day Yang Kai bade farewell to the three of Qiantian Sect, accompanied by Huang Juan and Lin Yun'er.

Although Gu Zhen and the others wished to keep him, they knew Yang Kai had just emerged from the Imperial Garden and had many matters to attend to, so they did not stop him and personally escorted him to the location of the Haicheng City space array.

Yang Kai's next destination was Demon Blood City!

Demon Blood City is a city controlled by the Demon Blood Sect, not far from Flowing Flame Sandland.

When Yang Kai first left Flowing Flame Sandland, it was at the border that he encountered the Demon Blood Sect disciple Deng Ning, through whom he obtained the Demon Blood Threads secret art; Deng Ning then took him to Demon Blood City.

That route choice had been sound, but Gu Zhen warned him that Demon Blood City might be somewhat unsettled now and told him to be careful all the way.

Demon Blood City was indeed far from peaceful.

When Yang Kai and his party teleported from the Haicheng City space array to Demon Blood City, they immediately sensed unrest within the city and saw many people engaged in combat.

No wonder — the Demon Blood Sect's great elder and the Sect Master both perished in the Imperial Garden, and with no one to wield overall authority within the sect the elders were naturally vying for power.

The Demon Blood Sect had always been prone to internal strife; with this pretext the entire sect was now in turmoil, and Demon Blood City had become utterly chaotic.

Even the great hall housing the space array was left unguarded; all the sect disciples had been drawn into the dispute, and the city played out a continuous spectacle of killing and being killed.

After arriving in Demon Blood City, Yang Kai released his divine sense and quickly grasped the situation inside. He showed no fear; he circulated his Saint Yuan, wrapped Huang Juan and Lin Yun'er in his protection, and flew toward the city outskirts.

Those who tried to block their path along the way all became dead souls under Yang Kai's command.

With his current strength, he would not fear even a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm opponent, let alone those mere cats and dogs.

Soon the Demon Blood Sect disciples realized Yang Kai's might; no one dared to stand in his way and invite death. Moreover, Yang Kai came and went swiftly — clearly a passing master; who would invite trouble by blocking him? That would be courting death.

Therefore, in less than a dozen breaths Yang Kai had taken Huang Juan and Lin Yun'er out of Demon Blood City and headed straight for Flowing Flame Sandland, one hundred thousand li away.

A day later, Yang Kai found an exquisite palace outside Flowing Flame Sandland and rushed straight inside.

This was Yang Kai’s first time entering this palace as well. It belonged to the Lingxiao Sect, and within it stood a Space Array that Yang Yan had personally set up to allow the sect’s disciples to come and go with ease.

After all, Flowing Flame Sandland covered too vast an area; relying solely on flight it would take at least a day or two from here to reach Lingxiao Sect's main headquarters. With this dedicated space array it was different — one could come and go in an instant.

At the moment there were only two Lingxiao Sect disciples on guard in the palace; their cultivations were nothing to speak of, only Third Stage of the Saint Realm. Such strength was insignificant on the Dark Star, but with Lingxiao Sect's reputation at its zenith no one dared to ruffle its whiskers, so there was no worry about security here. Furthermore, Yang Yan had set up a grand formation around the palace; anyone attempting to use this space array to invade Lingxiao Sect would be blocked by the formation, and the guarding disciples would have ample time to destroy the space array.
