## Chapter 812 — Let Me Try

Just as Yang Kai prepared to leave, a terrifying surge of energy erupted from the Huasheng Pool with a sizzling sound; the pool seemed to boil, bubbles continuously rising from below.

At the same time, the Spiritual Qi throughout the hollow churned into chaos, and, circling the pool, a vast formation flashed into being.

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened and his step halted; he fixed his gaze on the pool, then unleashed a tide of Divine Sense that seeped into the earth.

Caidie no longer had the leisure to argue with Yang Kai; together with the cat-eared girl she watched the Huasheng Pool and the white jade deer writhing and howling in the water, worry etched across her brow.

The Great Yao Lord at the poolside grew even grimmer than before; the yao yuan he poured forth swelled fiercer and radiated around the pool, yet as always it had little effect.

Even someone as powerful as the Great Yao Lord could not suppress the pool’s energy frenzy.

The white jade deer in the water tried to leap free but seemed gripped by invisible hands it could not shake off; it cried out in frantic howls, its eyes pleading toward the Great Yao Lord, clinging to life.

Every yao who saw it felt a sorrowful sympathy, the mood turning heavy.

Visible to the naked eye, mysterious forces battered through the deer’s body like swarms of insects tunneling through flesh, swelling painful bulges at random places—horrifying to behold.

Crimson blood flowed from its seven orifices as the seventh-tier demonic beast—qualified to transform—nearly burst apart and die.

The Great Yao Lord’s flow of yao yuan slackened noticeably; he looked at the white jade deer with a complicated expression of helplessness.

Everyone realized that this clansman would soon die, and they stood frozen in silent mourning; many yao even wept.

“Sister Caidie, can you do anything to save it…” the cat-eared girl pleaded through sobs.

Caidie forced a bitter smile, stroked the girl’s head, and shook her head helplessly.

If even the Great Yao Lord was powerless, what could she possibly do?

“Let me try—maybe I can save it,” Yang Kai, who had been observing in silence, suddenly spoke up.

Caidie paused and eyed him suspiciously, anger flickering across her pretty face. “You, a human?”

Yang Kai met her without fear, his gaze steady and burning.

Caidie frowned, unimpressed by this human’s confidence. “What ability do you have to save it? Don’t think that because the Great Yao Lord accepted some terms you can do as you please. This is the Yao Realm, not your human territory. If you displease me, I can kill you at any time.”

“Instead of talking, why don’t you ask the Great Yao Lord to decide?” Yang Kai snorted. Caidie’s evident loathing since their meeting puzzled him—he couldn’t see how he’d offended her.

“Maybe I can save it; maybe it will still die. But if you keep prattling on, your clansman will certainly die. We humans have a saying: treat a dead horse as if it were a living one—ever heard of it?”

Caidie’s expression chilled; she was about to speak when the cat-eared girl hurriedly nodded, “I’ll ask the Great Yao Lord!”

The girl darted to the pool’s edge with astonishing agility and quickly reported to the Great Yao Lord.

Caidie scowled at the scene and shot Yang Kai a cold glare. “What are you up to? Trying to undermine the foundation of our yao, destroy the Huasheng Pool?”

Yang Kai laughed, “Why are you so distrustful? You seem hostile toward humans—did someone hurt you before?”

At that remark Caidie’s eyes flashed with a murderous chill; Yang Kai had touched a hidden, painful memory—her face twisted.

Before she could become furious, Yang Kai said, “I have no interest in your pool itself; rest assured. What interests me is whatever’s hidden beneath it.”

“Hidden beneath?” Caidie frowned, but before she could question further the cat-eared girl returned, seized Yang Kai without ceremony, and dragged him toward the pool, shouting, “The Great Yao Lord told you to go over!”

Yang Kai nodded slightly and, under Caidie’s wary gaze, followed the girl to the poolside.

“I want to see what you’re up to!” Caidie snorted and hurried after them.

The assembled yao experts watched with curiosity—why would the Great Yao Lord allow a human near the pool at such a critical moment?

Close to the pool, Yang Kai felt the terrifying magnitude of its energy more clearly.

“The cat lass says you have a way?” the Great Yao Lord asked in a commanding voice, his eyes sternly fixed on Yang Kai.

“I can try,” Yang Kai replied with a slight nod, careful not to promise too much.

“Just try?” the Great Yao Lord frowned, displeased.

“If it’s going to die anyway, why not let me try? Maybe I can avert disaster.” Yang Kai smiled calmly.

The Great Yao Lord considered briefly, then decided, “Fine. You may try! But no matter the outcome, you must give me a satisfactory explanation afterwards.”

“I will.” Yang Kai nodded—if he chose to act, he was ready for the Great Yao Lord’s interrogation.

Having spoken, Yang Kai closed his eyes and let a flood of Divine Sense surge outward.

Feeling the power contained in his Divine Sense, the gathered yao experts changed color; even the Great Yao Lord involuntarily uttered, “Divine Sense Fire?”

Caidie, who had been approaching, halted in her tracks, her eyes trembling.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense poured forth openly—he could no longer hide his cultivation.

It was Divine Sense power comparable to a First Stage Saint, and it was of a special character.

Like quicksilver, his Divine Sense flowed into the earth, entering everywhere; no one knew exactly what he was doing, only that his presence moved rhythmically beneath the surface.

Centered on the Huasheng Pool, bright lines of energy periodically flickered across the ground.

The white jade deer still howled in pain, its flesh twitching and bones cracking as the mysterious force within drove it toward doom.

Its deer-eyes brimmed with Blood Beads, each rolling down in turn, terrifying to behold; yet it gazed at Yang Kai as if looking at a final straw, desperate and pleading.

Unmoved, Yang Kai accelerated the flow of his Divine Sense.

Gradually, all the yao experts felt the pool’s chaotic energy calm somewhat, as if smoothed by an invisible hand, steadily stabilizing.

Everyone brightened—even Caidie, who had previously held prejudice against Yang Kai, could not help showing concern and hope, for he had achieved what even the Great Yao Lord had not.

“Come on!” the cat lass cheered for the white jade deer while watching Yang Kai with nervous intensity.

Once a positive sign appeared, excitement grew uncontrollably.

As time passed, the bubbles rising from the pool diminished in size and number; the chaotic energy steadied, and the white jade deer in the water ceased its earlier agony, instead displaying a look of almost pure contentment.

“He actually managed it?” Caidie stared, unbelieving and slightly dazed.

The yao experts around them were stunned, holding their breath—many now felt excitement and joy.

They rejoiced that the white jade deer’s death had been averted.

Half an hour later, everything quieted down.

An hour later, the white jade deer again experienced the earlier convulsions and bone-cracking; it endured inhuman torment, crying out in sharp, frantic howls.

But the observing yao experts showed no worry; instead their faces brightened with delight.

They knew the deer was about to complete its transformation.

Sure enough, amid the writhing flesh and cracking bones, the deer’s beast form gradually shifted toward a human shape.

Yang Kai opened his eyes and drank in the miraculous scene, clicking his tongue in admiration.

The transformation lasted a long time.

When a naked youth with a pair of horns on his forehead emerged from the pool, all the yao experts burst into cheers.

The Great Yao Lord reached out and swiped a prepared robe over the youth; tugging forcefully, he hauled him from the Huasheng Pool.

The youth knelt, trembling violently and gasping; after some time he staggered up and looked upon the world like a newborn, his lively eyes filled with curiosity.

“Another one, hehe…” the cat lass bounded forward, patting the youth’s head with joy. “Wonderful.”

The youth turned to Yang Kai and opened his mouth as if to speak, but could not; his youthful face, however, was full of gratitude.

“No rush.” the cat lass soothed gently. “After you recover a few days, sister will teach you to speak.”

The youth nodded obediently.

“Caidie, take him back to rest,” the Great Yao Lord ordered sternly.

Caidie nodded, her gaze complex as she glanced at Yang Kai; she and the cat lass led the youth toward Thundertree Palace.
