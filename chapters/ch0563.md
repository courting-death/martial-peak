## Chapter 563 — Still More Experts

“Fall back,” Meng Wuya said in a deep voice.

“Fall back to where?” Yang Kai asked urgently.

“Return to the mansion.”

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise, but soon his expression hardened as he nodded heavily. Since Meng Wuya said so, there must be a way to avoid this crisis.

While the two discussed, Ye Xinrou had also steadied her mind and was directing the combined forces of the Seven Great Families to act in an orderly fashion, preparing to retreat to Zhongdu. Suddenly, she seemed to recall something and turned to Yang Kai, saying, “Yang Kai, I want to conscript your men.”

Yang Kai glanced at her coldly, his face full of disdain.

“You command so many masters; you should fight alongside us. Safety in numbers will increase everyone’s chances of survival. Now, I hope you can prioritize the greater good. Our grievances can be settled after this is all over.”

These words had already been spoken to Qiu Yimeng earlier but were ignored. Now with the crisis at hand, Ye Xinrou used the same argument on Yang Kai, causing many to feel unsett.

Yang Kai shook his head. “I will not join you. If you want to return to Zhongdu, suit yourselves.”

Ye Xinrou shouted angrily, “Yang Kai, why are you always so selfish? Not working with us is just seeking your own destruction. If you won’t think for yourself, then at least consider those around you!”

“My affairs have nothing to do with you,” Yang Kai said calmly, as if unaware of the imminent danger. His cold face carried a hint of indifference. “You’d better focus on your own side. Those seven won’t be able to hold them off for long. If you keep dawdling, you may never return to Zhongdu!”

Ye Xinrou’s expression changed sharply. “There are only three of them over there, and the Eight Great Families’ seven can handle them. How could they not defeat them?”

Even now, she harbored massive illusions about the situation, thinking that Yang Liting and his seven could crush the vanguard of the Cangyun Evil Land.

“Ye Xinrou, the young master has a point. We should leave quickly,” Gao Rangfeng urged.

“Yes,” Kang Zhan nodded anxiously. Feeling the overwhelming destruction outside, no one wished to stay any longer. Zhongdu, only a hundred li away, was their ideal refuge. “Brother Meng has already gone to notify the Eldest Young Master. We should hurry. His men will soon arrive to join us. No need to force Young Master if he won’t come along!”

Gao Rangfeng and Kang Zhan’s persuasion left Ye Xinrou no choice but to stop pressing. She sulked, “If that is so, then we leave.”

She cast a resentful glance at Yang Kai, her pretty face flashing with schadenfreude. “Yang Kai, I hope you don’t die too soon. When this is all over, I’ll come looking for you.”

Without giving Yang Kai time to reply, she turned and walked away.

The combined forces of the Seven Great Families quickly followed.

“Return to the mansion!” Yang Kai waved his hand and led the group back to the estate.

They had just packed up when they were forced to return. Everyone was somewhat lost, especially as outside the War City, ten li away, a titanic battle raged. Countless Demonic Beasts surged fiercely in their direction.

Anxiety gripped everyone’s heart. A sense of impending death spread through every fiber of their being.

“What shall we do now?” those at the mansion asked Yang Kai.

Yang Kai looked back at Meng Wuya.

Shopkeeper Meng smiled, “No need to worry. If I ordered you back, it means I have a foolproof plan. Do what you must, but do not leave the mansion. It’s too unsafe outside.”

Everyone was bewildered and stunned, completely unsure of what Meng Wuya meant.

The people of Cangyun Evil Land had already crossed the threshold, and if they weren't leaving, shouldn’t they at least prepare defenses? Yet Meng Wuya told them to simply go about their business. What odd advice was this?

His expression turned serious. “I will not gamble with your lives. When the danger truly comes, you will understand. Trust me, and do not just stare at me here.”

His words only confused them more, but what was clear was that he was confident he could guarantee their safety.

Meng Wuya did not reveal his method—perhaps it was inconvenient to disclose. Yang Kai frowned. “Since Shopkeeper Meng says so, then... disperse. Do whatever you need to do.”

Upon Yang Kai’s command, the crowd scattered. Though their doubts remained, they had no choice but to trust Yang Kai’s judgment.

Li Yuanchun looked at Meng Wuya suspiciously, sweeping him with his powerful Divine Sense for a long time before doubtingly saying, “You wield such power? Don’t talk big now.”

Newly arrived, Li Yuanchun was unaware of Meng Wuya’s true stature. He assumed him only to be a Divine Roaming Realm peak cultivator.

Even Li Yuanchun felt the monstrous pressure outside. How could Meng Wuya possibly protect so many?

Meng Wuya chuckled mysteriously, his expression inscrutable.

Even Earth Demon cast a doubtful look at Shopkeeper Meng, confused about where Meng Wuya's confidence came from to guarantee everyone's safety.

“Qiu Yimeng, arrange a place for the overseas elders to stay as well,” Yang Kai instructed calmly.

“All right.” Qiu Yimeng nodded and signaled the group to follow her.

Li Yuanchun shook his head. “I will stay and follow Young Master Yang.”

He clearly intended to accompany Yang Kai until the Tai Yi Seal was returned to the Tai Yi Sect.

Qiu Yimeng hesitated and looked at Yang Kai, who lightly nodded.

Only then did Miss Qiu lead everyone into the mansion.

Violent fluctuations came from outside the war city, a dozen powerful presences locked in deadly combat.

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he extended his Divine Sense to monitor the situation.

Though he was at odds with the Eight Great Families and had even clashed fiercely the night before with many casualties, with Cangyun Evil Land’s massive invasion, Yang Kai still did not want those seven to perish so easily.

Should anything happen to them, the war city itself would be doomed to ruin. If the Eight Great Families suffered heavy losses, whether Zhongdu could be defended would be uncertain.

His parents were there in Zhongdu after all!

If not for this reason, Yang Kai would not care about the fate of those Eight Great Families.

Suddenly, Yang Kai's expression changed drastically. He quickly retracted his Divine Sense and redirected it toward one direction within the war city.

There, two extremely sinister and terrifying auras quietly spread.

“More experts!” Yang Kai was alarmed.

Ling Taixu and Li Yuanchun froze, quickly investigating. In the next moment, their faces twisted.

They had also noticed.

Unseen and unheard, two cultivators beyond the Divine Roaming Realm had infiltrated the war city. They likely took advantage of the massive disturbance caused by Lightning Shadow King, the other two, and the Spider Mother to slip in unnoticed.

Soon, Li Yuanchun’s expression grew strange. Staring at Yang Kai blankly, he realized Yang Kai had sensed those two before himself.

This boy... Li Yuanchun found himself somewhat at a loss.

“The Destruction Poison King and the Yinming Ghost King!” Ling Taixu exclaimed in horror.

He recognized their unique monstrous auras immediately. Both were extraordinarily special evil kings: one wreathed in poison, the other shrouded in ghostly qi. It was impossible not to recognize them.

“They’re heading toward the combined forces of the Seven Great Families,” Ling Taixu said, then turned to Yang Kai.

The Seven Great Families had suffered heavy losses in last night’s battle. Although Yang Wei and Yang Zhao had gathered all warriors available now, without any cultivators beyond the Divine Roaming Realm to lead them, relying on Yang Zhao and Yang Wei’s four Blood Servants alone would be insufficient to repel two such powerful evil kings.

The evil kings had revealed their presence, clearly preparing to strike.

Yang Kai’s expression showed hesitation as he pondered before speaking in a low voice, “I’ll go check it out.”

Ling Taixu smiled faintly. “I’ll go with you.”

Earth Demon said, “This old servant will go along.”

“We’ll come too,” Tu Feng and the others said in unison.

Meng Wuya cleared his throat. “I will not go. I must stay to ensure the safety of those in the mansion.”

Li Yuanchun stared at them in disbelief. “Are you crazy?”

He couldn’t understand why these people would risk scattering their strength when the situation outside was so perilous.

Why was there such a huge difference in mindset between the experts inland and those overseas? Li Yuanchun thought bitterly.

Yang Kai gave him a look. “Elder, you’ve traveled far. It’s better to rest here.”

Li Yuanchun shook his head vigorously. “No, I have to stay close to you.”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “Suit yourself.”

Li Yuanchun almost spat blood in frustration. Yang Kai’s attitude clearly assumed he’d follow anyway—treating him like a free bodyguard.

Yet he couldn’t refuse.

Though annoyed, he had no choice but to sulk quietly.

“Earth Demon, don’t go. Focus on recuperating,” Yang Kai reminded. Last night he had performed the Demonic Shadow Sacred Art, and probably had not recovered yet; going now would be of little help.

Earth Demon considered but did not insist. “Then take care, Young Master.”

“Don’t worry. There are only two enemy experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. We have two of our own plus eight Blood Servants. It won’t be dangerous,” Yang Kai said softly and stepped out briskly.

Elsewhere within the war city.

Under Ye Xinrou’s command, the combined forces of the Seven Great Families moved swiftly toward Zhongdu.

During this, warriors from both Yang Zhao’s and Yang Wei’s mansions gathered continuously until a massive force had formed.

This force numbered nearly seven or eight hundred. Though most were not very strong, the sheer mass of people made Ye Xinrou, Kang Zhan, and Gao Rangfeng feel a faint sense of safety.

It seemed that with so many shore up, even if evil kings from Cangyun Evil Land attacked, they could not overwhelm them.

Yang Zhao and Yang Wei were both in the ranks, riding their cloud-steeds side by side.

“Where is Ninth Brother?” Yang Wei asked, not seeing Yang Kai in the crowd.

“The Young Master doesn’t care to fight with us. He stayed behind with his people,” Ye Xinrou replied, sneering, “He’s seeking his own death. I can't help it.”

Yang Zhao glanced coolly at Ye Xinrou, his expression indifferent.
