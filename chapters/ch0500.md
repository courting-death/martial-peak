## Chapter 500 — Shui Ling

Inside the room, Yang Kai sat upright in the chair, his expression composed and serene.

Ying Jiu and Di Mo had also returned to the room, standing behind him, while the mysterious woman stood five zhang before Yang Kai.

Having suffered a few losses, she had become quite compliant, aware that as long as the little figure made of hair was held firmly in Yang Kai’s hand, she would have no chance of escaping his “Five Finger Mountain” grasp.

Her delicate jade hands were intertwined, revealing the tension within her heart. Her head was slightly bowed, appearing utterly submissive, but the beautiful eyes hidden beneath her bangs constantly observed Yang Kai’s movements, waiting for the slightest lapse.

Occasionally, her small, crimson lips twitched as if muttering curses.

“Your existence makes me wary,” Yang Kai admitted frankly. “You seem to possess some unique ability. For someone like you, if I cannot bring you under my control, I will destroy you immediately!”

“Really?” The woman timidly raised her head and glanced at Yang Kai. Seeing the absolute seriousness on his face, it was clear he was not merely threatening her. Her heart trembled—this was the first time she had encountered a man so ruthless, seemingly indifferent to the pain he caused.

“Indeed,” Yang Kai nodded slightly. “So, you answer my questions truthfully. If there is anything that displeases me... you know the consequences.”

“Oh.” The woman rubbed her reddened forehead and nodded gently. Under such absolute dominance, she dared not resist any longer.

“What is your name?”

“Shui Ling.” The woman pouted softly, answering unwillingly.

“Shui Ling?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows. That name seemed quite fitting given her demonstrated abilities, but in Yang Kai’s memory, there was no such person, and even the surname was rather unusual.

“Where do you come from?”

“The Water Divine Hall...”

Yang Kai’s frown deepened. He racked his brain, searching for any known faction that might be connected to the Water Divine Hall, but found none. This was the first time he had heard of this sect.

However, Di Mo behind him showed a strange expression upon hearing the three words. His eyes filled with deep contemplation and a hint of doubt, as if the phrase had stirred fragmented memories. After a moment, he slowly shook his head. His memory was severely incomplete; the Water Divine Hall seemed somewhat familiar, but he could not recall any details even after careful thought.

“No need to guess, you do not know the Water Divine Hall.” Shui Ling noticed Yang Kai was deep in thought and laughed lightly, with a hint of contempt. It seemed as if mocking Yang Kai as a narrow-minded bumpkin.

“But I know you. Didn’t you just make up that sect to fool me?” Yang Kai scoffed coldly. She wore an aristocratic demeanor that made him uneasy.

Despite being a prisoner under surveillance, Shui Ling did not appear in the least nervous, like a scion of a great faction captured by a second- or third-rate power. She was utterly fearless.

“I did not. You are the one that's a frog in the well.” Shui Ling shook her head slowly. Her light blue hair swayed gently, animated and graceful.

“Water Divine Hall... such a sect does exist, you need not pursue this further. When the time comes, I will tell you.” Just as Yang Kai began to lose patience, Meng Wuya’s voice sounded in his ear.

“I understand.” Yang Kai did not inquire further, simply accepting the Water Divine Hall as a hidden faction.

“But since this girl is from the Water Divine Hall, you must handle her carefully. Otherwise, she could very well bring a devastating disaster upon your Yang Family.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly.

The Yang Family was already the top power in Zhongdu and a foremost superpower in the entire realm.

Yet according to Meng Wuya, the power of the Water Divine Hall seemed to surpass even the Yang Family!

How was that possible? A hidden sect with such strength?

His expression flickered, and Yang Kai continued, “Your age?”

Shui Ling pouted, biting her white teeth on her lower lip, answering softly, “Is that something I should say?”

Yang Kai shook his head firmly.

“Nineteen years old.” Shui Ling was clearly displeased. For a woman, age was always a sensitive subject, especially when questioned by a man.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, suddenly engulfed by an unreal feeling.

He could judge that Shui Ling's answer was genuine. In other words, she was indeed only nineteen! Furthermore, that aligned perfectly with her temperament and tone.

Yet a nineteen-year-old at the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm was baffling beyond belief! Such talent and aptitude surpassed all other young geniuses Yang Kai knew.

Even Liu Qingyao and the others seemed unqualified to serve her.

In an instant, Yang Kai elevated his assessment of the Water Divine Hall to a new level. A hidden sect capable of nurturing a prodigy like Shui Ling could indeed be superior to the Yang Family.

Though stunned inside, his face showed no sign of surprise, remaining calm.

Noticing this, Shui Ling seemed somewhat disappointed. She had hoped to see Yang Kai shocked, despondent, and struck hard by the news.

“How old are you?” Shui Ling asked curiously.

“Almost eighteen.” Yang Kai replied kindly.

“No way?” Shui Ling was surprised. “Judging from your behavior and style, that doesn’t seem right.” Then she added with a hint of disdain, “But your aptitude is mediocre at best.”

Her criticism came confidently, showing no awareness of her status as a prisoner. Her expression was natural, as if she deserved to make such judgments.

Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Are there many like me in your Water Divine Hall, young but strong?”

Shui Ling snorted. “Let me put it this way: if you joined the Water Divine Hall, your aptitude among the young generation would rank within the top one hundred.”

“And you?” Yang Kai showed genuine interest.

Shui Ling immediately became smug, holding up three pristine fingers. “Top three.”

“Oh, noted.” Yang Kai nodded. “If time permits, I will visit your Water Divine Hall and spar with your young elites.”

Shui Ling laughed contemptuously. “You? You probably don’t have the qualifications. When I say you’re impressive, I mean only here. In our halls, you wouldn’t even count.”

“Here? There?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Hmph!” Shui Ling arrogantly lifted her head, looking at Yang Kai with disdain, slanting her eyes. “I know you’re trying to pry information out of me. So what? The fact remains. Feeling defeated?”

Yang Kai smiled calmly, his eyes burning with a fierce fighting spirit. “Water Divine Hall, I will come.”

Shui Ling’s arrogance slowly faded. She looked at Yang Kai as if he were a fool, unable to understand why this man could be so excited after hearing all this.

What sort of man was he?

“I still have a few questions.” Yang Kai didn’t want to persist on earlier topics; the woman was too young for pointless arguments.

“Will I be allowed to leave after answering?” Shui Ling’s eyes darted about.

“Whatever you want.” Yang Kai smiled.

“Then hurry up and ask.” Shui Ling’s face lit up in excitement, eager to fly away.

“You said you came here searching for someone. Who?”

“Someone I don’t know.” Shui Ling shook her head. “She hides her face behind a veil; I don’t know what she looks like...”

“What do you want with her?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. Suddenly, Shui Ling felt a chilling gaze like that of a venomous snake. She understood that if she said the wrong thing next, she might face merciless slaughter.

Her heart trembled as she stared at Yang Kai in shock, unable to understand his sudden change in aura. After a moment’s hesitation, she cautiously responded, “Her constitution is strange, and her talents surpass even yours. I want to recruit her into the Water Divine Hall...”

Yang Kai suddenly rose, his True Yuan surging wildly.

Shui Ling was startled, immediately retreating several steps and assuming a defensive stance, trembling as she asked, “What are you doing?”

“How do you know her constitution is strange?” Yang Kai advanced step by step, his overwhelming Divine Sense enveloping the entire space around her.

The person Shui Ling sought was undoubtedly Xia Ningshang! This explained why she had infiltrated near the pill workshop.

But the fact that she noticed Xia Ningshang’s unique constitution made Yang Kai uneasy. Xia Ningshang possessed the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body—a constitution born for alchemy and capable of reaching the pinnacle of the alchemist profession.

Meng Wuya had always protected Xia Ningshang to prevent others from coveting her. Yet if news of her constitution leaked, even Meng Wuya might not safeguard the young Senior Sister’s safety.

At that time, no matter who captured the young Senior Sister, it would not be a result Yang Kai wanted.

He had to guard against trouble before it happened. If necessary, he would not hesitate to kill to silence witnesses.

“I just know!” Shui Ling screamed. She detected the murderous intent in Yang Kai’s eyes, her heart terrified. Fear flooded her gaze as she retreated repeatedly.

“How do you know?” Yang Kai pressed on mercilessly, giving no time for respite.

“How would I know? When she entered the city that day, I just felt it... Maybe it’s related to my special constitution too!”

Yang Kai stopped his steps, staring at Shui Ling from less than half a chi away, observing her thoroughly from all directions.

Shui Ling shivered with cold dread, feeling utterly exposed before the man’s penetrating gaze.

“Your constitution is special too?” Yang Kai said with surprise.

Shui Ling nodded lightly, gasping for breath. Her full bosom rose and fell. She suddenly realized that this younger man exerted such intense pressure that even she, an elite of the Water Divine Hall, struggled to endure it.

From such close distance, she could have easily attacked using her nearly full-stage advantage. But Shui Ling dared not. She felt that even without the little figure restraining her, this man was not someone she could kill.
