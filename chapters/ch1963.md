## Chapter 1963 — Wu Mengchuan

Once Yang Kai really began to surge after breaking the restraining formation, Zhou Yi’s face changed drastically and he barked: “You brat, how dare you act this way — aren’t you afraid of being dealt with under sect rules!”

Chu Fei also shouted: “Yang Kai, you’re dead for sure now — absolutely dead! How dare you forcefully break the barrier; you’ve disrespected Protector Miao, no one will save you now; just wait to bear the full, wrathful fury of Protector Miao.”

He wore a gloating look, as if he truly saw Yang Kai’s death approaching, dancing with delight.

But very soon his smile froze, because in just that short span Yang Kai’s internal power fluctuations became increasingly obvious, growing ever stronger.

On his body, rune-like chains coiled like ropes, yet those rune chains seemed to be struck by some force, faintly showing signs of imminent shattering.

The restraining formation was about to be broken!

“How is that possible?” Chu Fei’s face filled with terror.

Yang Kai was only a martial artist at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; given that his power had been sealed by the formation, the fact he could break the barrier laid down by Senior Brother Pang was something Chu Fei could not believe his eyes.

“Not good!” Zhou Yi’s mind raced with other concerns — he and Yang Kai had already sworn mortal enmity; if Yang Kai truly recovered his strength and escaped from the Bone Prison, the first person he would aim for would very likely be Zhou Yi himself!

And he was already injured, his power sealed; he had no strength to fight back. That would surely be a death sentence.

At that thought, Zhou Yi’s face suddenly went pale and frantic. He shouted loudly, “Junior Brother Yan…”

No sooner had the words left his mouth than a burst of cracking sounds came from across. The rune chains tightened on Yang Kai’s body exploded into pinpricks of light and vanished, and the power of a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert surged out.

Yang Kai rose to his full height and, before Zhou Yi could even let out a second shout, used his own body as a shield and slammed straight into the prison wall ahead.

With a crash and bone fragments scattering, Yang Kai burst out like a beast escaping its cage. In a flash he appeared before Zhou Yi, thrusting a hand forward to grasp his throat.

Zhou Yi went rigid on the spot, frozen, eyes overflowing with terror as he trembled and stared at Yang Kai at arm’s reach; his throat made only wheezing sounds and no other words could leave it.

Chu Fei and the others were so frightened by the sudden change that they stumbled back and collapsed on the floor.

Yang Kai’s expression was cold as he stared at Zhou Yi. The corner of his mouth curled up slowly into a cruel, cold smile.

“Junior Brother Yang…” Zhou Yi swallowed. He did not struggle but instead looked at Yang Kai pleadingly, saying hoarsely, “You wouldn’t really want to kill me. Senior Brother did err before, but we are of the same sect… spare me and I will apologize! I won’t tell of what happened today — it’s not too late for you to stop now.”

“You think that’s possible? You fucking idiot!” Yang Kai sneered in contempt and tightened his grip a little.

With a crack, Zhou Yi’s neck was instantly snapped, twisted grotesquely to one side. Yang Kai tossed his corpse aside and took his Spatial Ring.

He didn’t bother to inspect how much wealth was stored inside. Yang Kai slipped the ring into his pocket.

In the cell, Chu Fei and the others were already trembling, collapsing weakly on the ground as they watched Zhou Yi die before their eyes. The three of them knew a great disaster had befallen them; panic and boundless regret surged up in their hearts as they looked at Yang Kai.

They had never expected that offending Yang Kai would end like this.

“Junior Brother Yang, spare my life! Senior Brother was wrong, I beg you, spare this dog’s life!” Chu Fei wailed, bawling and begging for mercy.

Yang Kai gave him a cold glance, full of disdain and disgust. He raised a finger and a strand of Golden Blood Threads shot out, striking Chu Fei’s forehead.

A smear of crimson appeared on Chu Fei’s brow; he froze, collapsing into a rigid, motionless heap as the light and vitality drained swiftly from his eyes.

The Golden Blood Threads flew through the cell, piercing the vital points of the remaining two men one after another and taking their lives, then swept up all three men’s Spatial Rings.

After finishing, Yang Kai turned and said, “Qianyun, stay here. I’ll be right back.”

“Where are you going?” Liu Qianyun looked stunned. From when she had sensed Yang Kai’s power surge, to the barrier breaking, to Yang Kai killing Zhou Yi and the others, everything had happened far too fast.

She had not fully processed it before Yang Kai had completed his deed.

Liu Qianyun quickly realized Yang Kai intended to break out of the Biyu Sect; otherwise he would not act so decisively and ruthlessly. She felt no objection — her feelings toward the Biyu Sect matched Yang Kai’s.

Who would join such a sect willingly unless forced?

Now, if they were to defect from the Biyu Sect, she had no emotional burden; her only worry was that with just the two of them they might not carve out a bloody path and could fail in the end.

Hearing Yang Kai speak, she hurriedly asked again.

Yang Kai had no time to explain; he gave her a reassuring look, then his figure blurred as he strode toward the depths of the Bone Prison.

He did not know exactly what lay at the heart of the Bone Prison, only that it was where Wu Mengchuan was held, and that the place was obviously fortified with copper walls and iron gates and strict precautions.

The deeper Yang Kai went, the darker and damper it became. The surroundings were marked by overt and hidden energy fluctuations, clearly set with powerful restraining formations or arrays — touching them would be disastrous.

What surprised Yang Kai greatly was that the prisoners in the Bone Prison looked at him with indifference; none shouted loudly. Instead, they acted as if they had long foreseen his arrival.

Some even guided his steps, showing him how to safely avoid the positions of those formations and arrays.

These fellows… must be on Wu Mengchuan’s side! Yang Kai decided in his heart; they had surely received Wu Mengchuan’s orders, which was why they were not surprised at his arrival and kindly guided him.

Yang Kai observed secretly and was shocked to find at least dozens of martial artists imprisoned in the depths of the Bone Prison. Some had their power sealed, yet Yang Kai could still sense they were not to be trifled with.

Those troublesome ones were clearly existences of the Dao Origin Realm.

Who the hell was Wu Mengchuan, and who were those people? Why were they all locked up here?

Yang Kai’s mind brimmed with questions; he faintly felt that something enormous and secretive within the Biyu Sect must be involved.

It was only after penetrating more than a hundred zhang inward that Yang Kai finally reached the end.

At the far end stood a cell hewn from some unknown material, its four sides sealed tight, with only a single window-sized opening; peering in revealed nothing but impenetrable blackness — not a thing could be seen.

Yet Yang Kai clearly sensed a living aura within, weak, lacking the majesty one would expect from a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm martial artist.

“Quick work, kid. Seems you have talent!” Wu Mengchuan’s voice came from inside the cell, tinged with surprise.

“Senior Wu?” Yang Kai tested with a question.

“Indeed, it is this old man.”

“What should I do now?” Yang Kai asked urgently. Whether they could escape the Biyu Sect safely depended on how formidable the one imprisoned here was; Yang Kai did not want to waste time.

“I will transmit a set of techniques to you; if you break the cell’s restraining formation you can open the door.” Wu Mengchuan’s voice came forth, and without further words he flowed Divine Sense into Yang Kai’s mind to imprint the method of breaking it.

Yang Kai frowned but did not resist; he began to ponder it carefully.

The method resembled the Secret Art he had used to undo the seal on himself, though it was somewhat more complex.

With his prior experience, Yang Kai comprehended it without much difficulty, and after about the time of half an incense stick he began to act.

As streams of energy burst from Yang Kai and poured into the prison door, the pitch-black gate emitted cracking sounds as strange arrays and restraints were peeled away layer by layer.

Time passed, and when Yang Kai slammed the door with a palm, the gate flashed with light and every restraining formation and array was dispelled.

Wu Mengchuan’s voice, a little excited, came again: “Well done, you truly have potential. Come help this old man pull out this damned Yanling Gold chain and I shall regain my freedom.”

His voice carried a fervent hope, bordering on frenzy.

This made Yang Kai hesitate slightly; he did not know whether releasing whatever was bound by that chain was wise — what if an uncontrollable monster was freed and they suffered for it?

But there was no choice now, so after a moment’s doubt he pushed those worries aside.

He pushed the door open and, using the faint light, focused his gaze inward.

Seeing Wu Mengchuan’s appearance made Yang Kai’s brows tighten.

On the opposite wall a humanoid figure clung like a grisly effigy, its limbs seemingly nailed in place by something unseen, frozen in that posture and pressed tight against the stone.

The human-shaped being’s original features were almost unrecognizable; it was emaciated to the point of bones, with little flesh left. Its cheekbones protruded horrifically; its hair was sparse and in disorder.

It would not be wrong to say the creature was already dead; there was barely any life aura. Yang Kai could not even sense the flow of blood within it.

Yet its two eyes were bright, glowing green like ghostly flames, making one’s skin crawl.

“Senior Wu?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Heh heh heh…” The gaunt old man nailed to the wall grinned wickedly and said, “Kid, don’t doubt it — I am Wu Mengchuan!”

“In this state you…” Yang Kai was at a loss for words. What kind of grudge could Wu Mengchuan possibly hold against the Biyu Sect to have been tortured to such a state?

“Persecuted by others, this old man merely endured and survived.” Wu Mengchuan spoke low, his voice like a demon’s wail.
