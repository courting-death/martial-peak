## Chapter 2100 — I Was Joking

The man surnamed Fu possessed formidable cultivation at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm; when he ran for his life his speed was undeniably fast.

In the blink of an eye he had ignited his Essence‑Blood and fled to a place more than a hundred li away.

Looking back with lingering fright, Fu froze—at that distant spot Yang Kai's trace had vanished; it was as if he had suddenly disappeared.

A chill sank into his heart; an inexplicable coldness and terror began to spread.

Ahead, a tumult of spatial fluctuations issued forth, and a pitch‑black figure abruptly materialized.

The figure was shrouded in boundless Demonic Qi, its features indistinct, but the gold and black twin lights radiating from its face made Fu feel as though he faced a grave foe.

Under those two gazes his mind stiffened; his consciousness muddled and his spirit grew restless.

He roared, immediately brought forth his short spear, formed complex seals with his hands, and poured Origin Qi frantically into the spear.

Whoosh…

The short spear, along with its uncanny speed, swelled—in the blink of an eye it transformed into a massive shaft more than ten zhang long; with a faint tremor it lunged straight at Yang Kai.

This was Fu's most powerful attack; he had absolute confidence in the strike—even an Emperor Realm expert would not dare ignore such an assault.

Yang Kai appeared, like those demonic men, to have lost his wits, driven only by a bloodthirsty intent; facing the impending danger he showed no intention of dodging, standing there in a daze.

Only when the spear was about to reach him did he, as if by instinct, fling out a punch.

The fist was wrapped in pitch‑black Demon Yuan, condensed and dark.

"You're asking for death!" Fu exulted, eyes widening as he watched for the aftermath, eager to see Yang Kai ground to pieces by his blow.

Boom…

A tremendous sound rang out; Yang Kai did not budge, yet the approaching spear was struck by a violent force. The more‑than‑ten‑zhang spear's radiance suddenly dimmed. It reverted to its original size and, with a speed even greater than before, plunged away into the distance and vanished.

"Ah?"

Fu's eyes nearly popped from their sockets; he could not believe what he saw. He rubbed his eyes hard and looked again, indeed finding Yang Kai completely unharmed.

While he was dazed, Yang Kai on the opposite side suddenly raised one hand.

Massive amounts of pure Demon Yuan welled from his body, flowing onto his arm and transforming that limb into something longer and larger.

In the blink of an eye a gigantic pitch‑black palm coalesced and slammed down straight at Fu's head.

It fell like a pitch‑black mountain from the sky, carrying a world‑shattering might.

Fu was terrified and hastily tried to dodge, but to his despair he found the space around him had somehow become solid and viscous, as if bound.

He could not get away!

Fu's face drained of color; as he cried out he produced a shield‑shaped defensive Secret Treasure, poured Origin Qi into it, and the shield immediately formed into a barrier above him.

Not only that, he kept forming seals and chanted rapidly, "Heaven, Earth, Xuan, Wu…"

Origin Qi within him surged and raged.

Before he could unleash that strange secret art, the pitch‑black mountain‑like palm had already come down.

Crack…

The barrier formed by the shield shattered like a mirror, splitting into countless fissures and collapsing into fragments, providing no protection; the great palm then struck Fu's body.

He only managed to emit an utterly terrified scream before falling silent.

The great palm gradually dissipated; on the ground, besides a huge palm print, there remained only a pulp‑like mass.

Under that palm, even Fu—whose cultivation reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—could not withstand it and was killed outright; all his Secret Treasures, even his Spatial Ring, were pulverized into fragments.

The items within the Spatial Ring were permanently banished into the void.

After finishing this, Yang Kai finally looked up expressionlessly and glanced in another direction.

There, Hua Qingsi—who had split from Fu and fled—looked back in terror; her lovely eyes trembled, having faintly heard the distant cry of agony, which made her heart panic and she fled even faster.

But at that moment a blur of space ahead appeared and a pitch‑black figure blocked her path.

"How can this be?" Hua Qingsi's pretty face changed and her heart plummeted.

She had parted from Fu and seen Yang Kai chase after the other, yet in less than a few breaths Yang Kai had already tracked him down and killed him, then blocked her way?

Even an Emperor Realm expert could never accomplish such a thing!

Gazing at that pitch‑black figure and feeling the violent, bloody aura emanating from it, Hua Qingsi's face went pale and the corners of her mouth turned bitter.

She did not dare act rashly. Instead, she forced a thin smile, revealing a trace of her allure and worldly grace despite the terror twisting in her chest.

The fact that the other could instantly kill Fu meant he could extinguish her with a flick—whether she resisted or not made no difference.

All she could now hope for was to awaken the deepest sliver of Yang Kai's consciousness.

"Young Brother…" Hua Qingsi trembled as she called softly, her voice more alluring than ever, "Please move aside, you're blocking my way."

Yang Kai stood motionless, merely gazing at her as if at a stranger.

The golden‑black light that shone from his eyes filled Hua Qingsi with dread and left her helpless.

It felt like a lamb facing a ferocious king of the jungle—its life and death lay entirely in the other's whim.

The only thing Hua Qingsi found fortunate was that Yang Kai did not kill her on sight; that gave her a sliver of hope for survival.

"It's your Sister—Young Brother, don't you remember me?" Hua Qingsi smoothed the hair at her ear and continued to try.

Whether by luck or misfortune, the moment she spoke Yang Kai did seem moved; his two‑colored pupils trembled violently again, as if instinctual awareness was struggling.

"Young Brother, I even saved your life just now… you wouldn't repay kindness with enmity, would you?" Hua Qingsi's garments were soaked with cold sweat, revealing her exquisite, full figure; beads of sweat slid down her cheek as her face remained pale but she forced herself to remain composed.

"Grr…"

Wrapped in Demonic Qi, Yang Kai suddenly clapped both hands over his head and emitted a low, guttural roar.

Hua Qingsi was startled and hastily took several steps back, but then realized that with his present strength even putting distance would be futile, so she forced a bitter smile and stood her ground.

"If you won't speak… Sister will leave then?" Hua Qingsi tested softly; seeing Yang Kai show no response, she rejoiced and said, "Then may the green hills remain and the waters flow—if fate allows, we shall meet again!"

At that she once again employed her Hundred‑Butterflies transformation, instantly becoming countless multicolored butterflies and fleeing like a gust of wind.

But at that moment the low‑roaring Yang Kai suddenly straightened, reached out, and snatched at the place where the butterflies were.

The hundred butterflies dispersed and Hua Qingsi's body reappeared, her expression deathly ugly.

She was suddenly mortified and cried, "What do you want? You won't say a word, you won't let me go—then just kill me!"

Yang Kai paid her no heed and reached his hand down toward where she stood.

"Ah?" Hua Qingsi felt her heart drop and cried out in alarm, "I was joking! How could you take it seriously? No, no…"

As she spoke she desperately rallied Origin Qi to try to resist.

But the disparity in strength between her and Yang Kai now was such that he could easily crush her.

Before her Origin Qi could gather, Hua Qingsi felt her body tighten as if wrapped by an invisible force; a suffocating sensation came, her Divine Sense blurred, and in the next instant everything went black.

When she regained her senses, Hua Qingsi stood dazed on an open plain, her pretty face deathly white.

 She turned and looked about; the ground was level, and dense forest surrounded the area. A breeze blew, cool and pleasant.

This was not the Star Realm!

Hua Qingsi immediately felt that this place differed from the Star Realm; she could not say exactly how, but she was certain it was not the Star Realm.

Was she dead?

Death turned out not to be as terrifying as imagined; she had felt nothing at all and had already perished.

After death she had come to a place like this? Where then was that annoying fellow from Fei Sheng Palace? Could this be the legendary Nether Prison?

Her mind swam with wild thoughts and Hua Qingsi felt faint.

"Hmm… I didn't kill you; instead I sent you here. It seems the true body's consciousness remains—at least some of it!" a thunderous voice suddenly sounded in Hua Qingsi's ear.

The sound was like war drums; it frightened Hua Qingsi greatly.

"Who!" Hua Qingsi cried, her pretty face changing as she looked about warily, but found no trace of anyone.

"Look up, look up!" the voice rang again.

At that prompt Hua Qingsi hurriedly raised her head to gaze upward.

Before her stood two pillar‑like presences, like stone columns.

She had noticed these two pillars when she first arrived, but had not yet shaken off her deathlike stupor and had not thought much about them.

Now looking more closely, she found the two pillars resembled thighs, only without flesh—entirely composed of strange stone.

Her gaze continued upward and Hua Qingsi's face shifted through surprise, puzzlement, and finally stunned horror, an intense parade of emotion.

After truly seeing what the object beside her looked like, Hua Qingsi drifted dozens of zhang away.

From a farther vantage she finally saw more clearly; her lovely eyes trembled and she was instantly thrown into disarray by the sight.
