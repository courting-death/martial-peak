## Chapter 1165 — Ren Respect One Zhang I Respect One Zhang

"Slots?" Yang Kai frowned and looked at Qian Tong, asking, "Is there a limit to how many people can enter Flowing Flame Sandland?"

"That's exactly what I wanted to tell you," Qian Tong nodded. "When Flowing Flame Sandland first opened, there wasn't much of a limit, but you know, resources on Dark Star are scarce — the better the high-grade things, the fewer they are. As one of the three forbidden lands, Flowing Flame Sandland naturally contains precious things, and every major power has been eyeing that place. The problem arose long ago: when Flowing Flame Sandland opened, every Saint King Realm who qualified rushed in all at once. With so many people, each person's harvest became small, and the heaven-and-earth treasures inside were collected without restraint, so when the land opened again next time, those who entered found little to gain."

"Overuse will certainly cause that!" Yang Kai nodded.

"You're right, nephew, so the major forces on Dark Star united and set some restrictions for Flowing Flame Sandland: each family can't send too many people. The top three powers — Star Emperor Sect, Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect — may send sixty people; second-tier forces like my Yingyue Hall can send fifty; smaller ones send even fewer. Little clans and minor forces might only be allowed two or three. This reduces losses among the Saint King Realm warriors on Dark Star and helps preserve the number of heaven-and-earth treasures in Flowing Flame Sandland. After thousands of years, the forces adhere to this distribution whenever it opens, which is why there are quotas."

Yang Kai gave a slight nod to show he understood.

Qian Tong continued, "Even so, when Flowing Flame Sandland opens, the number who enter is never less than ten thousand! But Flowing Flame Sandland is vast; no one knows its true size, so even ten thousand inside is no problem."

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood what Qian Tong meant by his earlier remark.

If he wanted to go in, he'd have to take one of Yingyue Hall's slots — Yingyue Hall can send fifty people, so finding one slot was no great feat.

"Also," Qian Tong went on, "you can't enter Flowing Flame Sandland from just anywhere. That forbidden land is strange. We suspected it might be a vast formation left by some ancient powerhouse, but we've never found a way to break it. When its heat power wanes, weak points appear at different locations like formation gates; those who enter must pass through those weak points at the right times and places to truly get inside — otherwise you can't get in."

Yang Kai listened and immediately realized he'd been thinking too simply.

Entering Flowing Flame Sandland required a quota and the right time and place; it wasn't as casual as he had presumed when it opened.

With that in mind, Yang Kai hurriedly said, "Senior, if I want to enter Flowing Flame Sandland, I will trouble you to take care of the arrangements."

Qian Tong laughed heartily. "You're too polite, nephew. If I treated you as an outsider I wouldn't have told you so much today. Since you intend to enter, leave the rest to me — I'll make sure you're satisfied."

He worried Yang Kai might not seek him out; though Qian Tong sincerely wished to befriend Yang Kai, he feared the younger man wouldn't appreciate it. Young people are proud and often ignore old men like them.

Now that Yang Kai had asked for his help, he was naturally pleased.

Changing the subject, Qian Tong said, "But nephew, if you want to go in, you must be fully prepared."

"What do I need to prepare?" Yang Kai asked humbly.

"You should forge or refine secret treasures that resist heat. If you lack suitable secret treasures, I can supply you with materials from ice-type demonic beasts. Treasure forged with these materials is best suited for Flowing Flame Sandland. I've collected plenty of such materials; there's no shortage."

Yang Kai was about to refuse, but then he paused, thought for a moment, and asked, "Wei and Miss Dong are going to Flowing Flame Sandland too, right?"

Qian Tong nodded. "Of course. That place is dangerous, but they're the hall's best two disciples — how can they grow without facing storms?"

"And their secret treasures..."

Qian Tong smiled awkwardly. "We bought some, but most are Saint King-Grade Upper-Level; I don't know how effective they'll be. Yingyue Hall once had an Origin-Grade artificer, but he's old and can no longer forge."

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "If you trust me, senior, why not give those ice-type demonic beast materials to me? In a few days I'll deliver two Origin-Grade secret treasures to them for protection."

Qian Tong already assumed an Origin-Grade artificer backed him, so Yang Kai didn't need to hide. He'd hinted earlier that he'd collected many materials, signaling he intended to ask his fictitious master to forge them. Qian Tong had helped him a lot, giving him a quota and intel for entering Flowing Flame Sandland; Yang Kai didn't mind returning the favor.

If others show me an inch of respect, I’ll return them tenfold.

Seeing Yang Kai's cleverness, Qian Tong was overjoyed and nodded repeatedly. "Don't worry, I trust you a thousand times over! Ha ha ha, thank you, nephew."

He had feared that if Yang Kai didn't catch his hint, he'd have to beg openly for Yingyue Hall's future. To his surprise, Yang Kai understood after a single roundabout remark.

Saying that, Qian Tong produced a spatial ring and handed it to Yang Kai.

He had the materials prepared and had brought Wei Guchang and Xuan'er over earlier partly so they could meet Yang Kai and partly to create an opportunity for Yang Kai to forge the treasures. Sadly, those two lacked discernment and wasted Qian Tong's effort.

Yang Kai took the ring and casually glanced inside, finding a mass of ice-cold demonic beast materials; from the strength of the chill they were unquestioningly Ninth-Tier beasts, and even the beasts' inner cores were included.

Dark Star lacked neither alchemical nor forging materials, but it lacked high-grade alchemists and artificers.

So much material could forge four or five secret treasures.

"Nephew, I'll leave this matter to you — I am most grateful," Qian Tong said.

"You've helped me much, Senior. No need for thanks. If you need anything later, just say the word."

Qian Tong nodded repeatedly; though Yang Kai spoke politely, it comforted him to hear it.

"By the way, Senior, when will Flowing Flame Sandland open?" Yang Kai finally asked.

Qian Tong pondered. "It's hard to say — it could be one or two months, or three or four. It depends on when the heat power wanes. Rest assured, experts from all the major forces watch it day and night; once it's enterable we'll get the news, and it's not too late to set out. You should take this time to rest and recover your strength. Once I get the news, I’ll inform you at once."

While speaking, Qian Tong handed Yang Kai a communication compass.

Yang Kai took it and tossed it into the spatial ring.

At that moment, someone knocked at the door again. Wu Yi opened it and saw Luo Qing entering meekly, his face cautious.

Qian Tong laughed, "Yan Pei must have sent Luo Qing to deliver the Saint Crystals."

Yang Kai's spirits lifted; Wu Yi and Yang Yan's eyes brightened too.

At the auction they'd sent four items, each fetching a handsome price; just now the Saint Crystal settlement completed. Yang Kai had waited both for Qian Tong and for these proceeds.

Thinking of that avalanche of Saint Crystals, even Yang Kai couldn't hide his excitement.

Luo Qing stepped forward respectfully and placed a Spatial Ring on the table. “Manager Yan said there should be one hundred six million, five hundred thousand and forty-five Saint Crystals,” he said. “But since the total amount was too large, the remainder was rounded off — the final sum is one hundred seven million Saint Crystals. Brother Yang, please verify it.”

"One hundred and seven million..." Yang Kai frowned — the number seemed off.

Qian Tong smiled and explained, "Jubao Tower's auction takes a fee, usually ten percent. So on a hundred million Saint Crystals they'd take ten million."

"That's robbery!" Wu Yi and Yang Yan cried out in unison; ten million gone — their hearts ached.

Qian Tong added, "But Yan Pei only took five percent this time — give him credit for some conscience. He probably hopes to work with you in the future, so he sold favorably."

Yang Kai shook his head with a smile. "There won't be such good things later. That Origin Condensing Pill was something my master obtained by chance; there's only the one. But senior, why did they fight so madly for the Origin Condensing Pill with Pill Patterns?"

Seeing Yang Kai puzzled, Qian Tong laughed. "Gu Chang and Xuan'er asked me the same question earlier."

He explained the reason, and only then did Yang Kai understand it wasn't madness but an obsession with reaching the Void King Realm.

Knowing this, Yang Kai felt reassured.

A Pill Pattern Origin Condensing Pill can be refined at any time with his alchemy techniques, but they were missing one main ingredient.

His Black Book Space held countless heaven-and-earth treasures and over a thousand Origin-Grade herbs, and two or three hundred Void King-Grade herbs, but only two stalks of Cui Luo grass — the indispensable herb for refining the Origin Condensing Pill — had already been used up. Without more Cui Luo Grass he couldn't refine the pill, so there was no chance to cooperate with Jubao Tower.

Moreover, now that he had over a hundred million Saint Crystals, he no longer needed to sell off things. One hundred million plus Saint Crystals — even Yingyue Hall couldn't raise that.
