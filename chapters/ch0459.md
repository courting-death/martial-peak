## Chapter 459 — The Snatch

Sensing this, Yang Kai's lips curled into a slight smile, though he made no overt move, content to keep his understanding to himself.

The agreed-upon time soon arrived. Everyone gathered by the shore of Po Jing Lake couldn't help but quietly gather their strength, ready to spring into action at any moment. Their eyes scanned every direction and their ears listened attentively, not only searching for the imminent appearance of the treasure but also alert to enemy movements.

To snatch the treasure, conflict was inevitable. The Yang Family intended to use this method to accelerate the progress of the succession war.

Unlike Yang Kai’s own sensations, the other five Yang Family scions, based on their own guesses, periodically glanced toward Po Jing Lake, designating the lake’s surface as a key guarded area. Occasionally, they would whisper with the nearby Blood Servants, seeking their opinions.

The atmosphere grew increasingly tense.

Suddenly, a beam of celestial light erupted from the bottom of Po Jing Lake, sending forth a burst of intense energy fluctuations. Visible to the naked eye beneath the crystal-clear water, bright streaks flickered forth and converged into a mysterious array that covered the entire lakebed.

The flow of Primordial Qi abruptly stilled.

“It has appeared!” Countless exclamations burst forth from the onlookers. Every person craned their necks, gazing eagerly at the edge of Po Jing Lake.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

One by one, beams of light suddenly shot up from the lake’s bottom, soaring straight into the heavens. Wrapped within the glow were numerous treasure pieces, each with a unique and colorful form, stirring greed and desire in the hearts of those watching.

In an instant, nearly a hundred beams of light flew upward, water droplets cascading down like a torrential storm.

All eyes clung to those beams like leeches, burning with intensity.

The beams shot up to roughly thirty zhang in height. Their momentum then slowed and, amidst a loud bang, they scattered outward haphazardly at meteor-like speeds!

“Young Master Kai!” Huo Xingchen turned to Yang Kai, anxiously urging him on.

Yang Kai lightly nodded.

At the next moment, half the forces on their side surged forward, rushing toward the nearest treasures and employing various tactics to seize them. Amidst loud laughter and joy, one treasure after another was snatched up.

None of the younger generation’s leading figures moved, and most Divine Roaming Realm practitioners remained inactive. Those rushing out were mostly True Essence Realm to Divine Roaming Realm Third Stage martial artists.

This situation was mirrored among the other factions as well.

Everyone knew that the first batch of treasures wouldn't be of very high quality. It wasn’t worth becoming disordered over these.

Moreover, since the first batch radiated outwards, effectively being offered on a silver platter, there was little risk of enemy contention or interference, eliminating any reason to rush recklessly.

Yet those watching with keen eyes felt burning greed. For these onlookers, whose strength was not very high, such a sudden appearance of numerous treasures stirred their hearts.

The six brothers had brought nearly eight hundred people in total. Even with only half deployed, over a hundred treasures seemed plentiful at first glance, but when divided, they were in short supply.

Not a single treasure escaped from Po Jing Lake; all were intercepted mid-flight by martial artists.

When these treasure bearers returned to their camps, smiles illuminated every face.

The first batch of treasures had been peacefully divided among the six factions, with no significant battle erupting. Each party's haul was roughly equal.

“All just lower-level Earth-Grade items.” Huo Xingchen looked at the treasures brought back with a sneer, muttering, “The Eight Great Families really are stingy with their Primordial Qi.”

Han Xiao Qi’s expression remained indifferent as she brushed aside strands of hair near her ear. “Young Master Huo, you hail from a super clan and cannot comprehend the hardships of lower-stage martial artists. These treasures may mean little to you, but for others, they can significantly enhance their strength.”

Huo Xingchen chuckled, “Your kindness is flattering. Although I’m from the Huo Family, we’re allies now. This matter is worth discussing; once this event concludes, let’s have a proper talk.”

Han Xiao Qi fell silent then, casting a pleading glance at Yang Kai, hoping he would interject to prevent Huo Xingchen from bothering her further.

Yang Kai frowned deeply, apparently lost in thought, his gaze fixed on the mysterious array beneath Po Jing Lake.

The shining patterns still emitted light, reflecting pool ripples. Just as Huo Xingchen’s words fell, nearly a hundred beams of light shot up again from the lake’s depths.

Huo Xingchen glanced at Yang Kai, seeing no change in expression, and hastily shouted, “Snatch!”

Those who had gained treasures earlier once again surged forth.

“Be careful!” Yang Kai suddenly admonished.

Still immersed in the joy of treasure snatching, some didn’t understand why he said this. But once they saw the flight paths of these treasures, they immediately grew alert.

This second batch of treasures differed from the first; they did not radiate outwards but instead clustered densely in the central airspace above Po Jing Lake, moving straight up and down.

Everyone condensed their True Essence, unleashing their full power. Martial Techniques and the treasures’ light bloomed, and the six factions collided in an instant.

Battle erupted fiercely!

About four hundred people from the six camps gathered there. Though ninety percent were True Essence Realm martial artists, some lower-level Divine Roaming Realm practitioners were also present.

The crowded scene in the central airspace turned chaotic at once.

Some seized a treasure only to be immediately targeted by four or five enemies. The treasure still warm in their hands, they were killed amidst shock and regret. Their broken bodies tumbled headfirst to the ground, dyeing the clear lake water with fresh blood.

Excited cries and shouts erupted from the onlookers.

Such a chaotic melee was exactly what these idlers longed to witness.

Within ten breaths, more than twenty had been killed, and the casualties kept mounting.

Almost all factions were involved, and every young leader’s face darkened with clenched teeth, thirsting to rush forth to assist.

Yet the six Yang Family scions gave no commands. Although their blood boiled and indignation flared, they remained motionless.

Everyone knew this was merely an appetizer. Should chaos break out prematurely, they would forever be on the defensive.

Gradually, each of the hundred treasures found an owner, but those holding them became targets of countless attacks. Allies guarded their own fiercely, fighting while retreating, leaving corpses dropping from the sky.

Some smart individuals, upon obtaining a treasure, hurled it forcefully back into their own camps before turning to snatch others’ treasures.

The melee gradually subsided. The six camps pulled back, distancing themselves carefully as they remained wary.

All had gains, and all had losses.

Po Jing Lake’s waters turned a deep crimson, nearly fifty bodies floating atop the surface.

“The Yang Family’s methods are indeed cunning!” Fatty Dong inhaled deeply, his Primordial Qi disturbed as he stared at the tragedy. Slowly shaking his head, he said, “More than a month of peace was shattered by a single order from a Yang Family elder, forcing these six factions to turn on each other.”

“Man dies for wealth just as birds perish for food!” Huo Xingchen sneered coldly. “The Yang Family has seen through this.”

“It’s so brutal.” Chen Xueshu sighed heavily. Since arriving at War City, this was his first time witnessing such a fight. Nearly fifty had died in less than the time it takes to finish a cup of tea. His Yingyue Sect had suffered losses too, and he was filled with sorrow.

“It’s too simple!” Yang Kai’s deep gaze suddenly spoke up.

“Simple?” Liu Feisheng looked at him in surprise, the others equally puzzled.

Yang Kai said nothing further but abruptly looked up, fixing his gaze on Yang Wei and Yang Zhao. He noticed them both frowning thoughtfully. When they caught his stare, they returned the look.

Through this exchange, Yang Kai knew they shared the same doubt.

If this snatching process really was so straightforward, then it was far too simple. The Yang Family would never choose this. The high-levels of the Yang Family now wanted as many casualties as possible. How could they allow a thousand treasures to appear in such a predictable way?

If this continued, the six factions could easily agree to divide the treasures peacefully.

Of course, that was unlikely.

Yang Kai thought this; Yang Wei and Yang Zhao thought the same. All three pondered what might come next.

The succession war was a battle of wit and courage. Raw bravery alone could not win.

As lives were lost, the atmosphere among the six factions thickened with hostility. Each faction stared coldly at the others, ready to settle old and new grudges in the next clash.

“This batch is somewhat higher in quality, but still not very good.” Huo Xingchen inspected the treasures brought back, shaking his head repeatedly.

In Young Master Huo’s eyes, except for the Heaven-Grade and Mystery-Grade treasures, everything else was rubbish. Even among Heaven-Grade treasures, only those of middle level were worthy of attention.

“We won't snatch the next batch!” Yang Kai suddenly declared.

“What?” Huo Xingchen was stunned. “Not snatch?”

Yang Kai glanced back at him. “Speak any louder and they’ll all hear.”

Embarrassed, Huo Xingchen lowered his voice. “Why not? If you don't snatch them, you'll only be handing them to others.”

Not only Huo Xingchen was confused, but the four maiden disciples from Wan Hua Palace also looked puzzled. The previous skirmish had cost them one disciple. All were filled with anger, eager for revenge. Yang Kai’s sudden refusal to snatch was hard for them to understand.

“Let’s wait and see.” Yang Kai shook his head. “If I’m right, the next treasures to appear should be upper-level Earth-Grade. Not snatching them won’t cost much, but if we do, there may be complications.”

Though still puzzled, no one dared to press the issue further.

They all secretly felt Yang Kai might be overly cautious...
