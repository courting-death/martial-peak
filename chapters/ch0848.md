## Chapter 848 — How Do You Know These?

Du Wan's room was filled exclusively with Saint-Grade Lower-Level alchemists; the roster was ostentatiously lavish.

Across the Tongxuan Continent, there were likely no more than twenty alchemists who had reached Saint-Grade; each was famed far and wide, known to all — and here, five had gathered.

As for Saint-Grade Middle-Level alchemists, there were even fewer—merely three or five in total.

It seemed the only Saint-Grade Upper-Level alchemist was the elusive Tianzang Elder, Li Rui.

Du Wan carefully introduced Yang Kai to each of the four alchemy masters, and they all regarded him with approving, pleased expressions.

They remembered Yang Kai's outstanding performance at the alchemy competition in Fuyun City; they believed that given time his achievements would surpass theirs, and they treated him as the hope of the alchemical world.

Mi Na returned once more with a fruit platter and tea, then withdrew again.

At gatherings of such high‑level figures she had no right to remain; not only her, even her master Ye Xiong was absent.

Only Yang Kai stayed behind with Du Wan, which showed how highly he regarded the young man.

The alchemists were old friends and spoke without ceremony; they spoke plainly, offering no attempt to spare Yang Kai any detail.

Yang Kai remained silent, listening calmly and composedly; he showed no impatience, and when someone raised an interesting topic he listened with evident relish.

After some discussion, Du Wan suddenly smiled and said, "You have come from so far to Giant Stone City—surely not just to chat with me? Have you encountered some matter?"

At those words the four alchemists all nodded gravely.

The old woman Kong Ruoyu said, "There is indeed something — let Chang Bao speak; he was the one who discovered it."

Du Wan couldn't help but turn his gaze to the official from the Shining City Alchemists' Association.

Chang Bao looked solemn, rummaged in his Spatial Pouch, and took out a somewhat damaged piece of beast hide; it was clearly ancient, inside and out exuding an air of antiquity. He handed it to Du Wan and said, "Have a look at this."

Du Wan accepted it and carefully spread the hide open. As he scanned it he gave a small sound of surprise and his gaze sharpened.

As he continued to look, Du Wan's expression grew excited and exhilarated, as though he had discovered something extraordinary.

Chang Bao explained at his side, "One of my disciples salvaged this spirit formation diagram and passed it to me. I pondered it for a year without cracking its secrets. So I thought to seek out He Feng, who wasn't far from me..."

He Feng forced a wry smile and said, "I was powerless as well, so the two of us went to find Brother Hong and Senior Sister Kong..."

Kong Ruoyu picked up the thread, "None of us could fathom it. Hearing that Senior Brother Du is about to reach Saint-Grade Middle-Level, we came to Giant Stone City to let you take a look."

Du Wan nodded slightly to show he understood. He studied the diagram at length, then shook his head in resignation: "You may be disappointed. This spirit formation diagram is intricate and complex; it doesn't look like formations used in recent eras—more like an ancient array. Besides, it's incomplete; even I am powerless to solve it."

Hearing him, the four showed no sign of disappointment.

They had come with nothing more than a 'let's try' attitude; they had not truly expected Du Wan could unlock the diagram's secrets.

Du Wan gave a mysterious smile and said, "Although I cannot unravel it, I know someone who could certainly tell what this spirit formation diagram is for."

"Who?" they all asked.

"Tianzang Elder!" he replied.

Chang Bao couldn't help rolling his eyes, "That master is elusive—appearing and vanishing like a dragon. How are we to find him? When I first learned alchemy this master was already world‑renowned; I'm now a Saint-Grade Lower-Level alchemist and have never seen his true face — it's a life's regret."

Among the five alchemists present, probably only Du Wan had ever seen Tianzang Elder.

But Du Wan did not boast about it; after all, he had long passed the age for showing off.

He cast a glance at Yang Kai and said, "Perhaps besides Tianzang Elder there are others who could solve it..."

He Feng impatiently urged, "Du Wan, stop teasing—if it's someone, just say it!"

Du Wan gave a dry chuckle.

Yang Kai caught his meaning and realized Du Wan wanted him to take a look—Du Wan had long suspected a powerful backer guided Yang Kai and believed that person could stand beside Tianzang Elder, hence the way he looked at him.

With no other choice, Yang Kai said, "Elder Du, may I have a look?"

Du Wan brightened and quickly handed over the hide.

Chang Bao immediately warned nervously, "Boy, be careful—don't damage it. If you do, I'll drag you back to Shining City."

"Don't worry," Du Wan chuckled decisively.

The five alchemists paid little more attention to Yang Kai; apart from Du Wan, the others assumed he was merely curious and returned to discussing the spirit formation diagram on the hide.

Having studied it for days, they each had their own theories; pooling them together they hoped to find a way to complete and decode the formation.

Yang Kai studied the diagram for a long while, then furrowed his brow.

The spirit formation on the hide was excessively convoluted—several formations cleverly interlaced, yet the whole felt somewhat cumbersome.

When those formations were separated, some resembled diagrams recorded in the True Alchemy Formula, but they were not identical; they likely came from a different era.

Alchemy continually evolves, and the formations used in alchemy are developed and refined by masters across the world; it is common for different eras to employ different formations.

With Yang Kai's current perspective he could naturally see the flaws and drawbacks in this formation.

But compared to the formations used today, the knowledge contained in this set was immense—if unlocked, it could bring great advancements to alchemy.

Du Wan clearly hoped Yang Kai would take the lead, and Yang Kai did not refuse.

He began to contemplate, comparing what he saw with the knowledge he had inherited from the True Alchemy Formula, repairing and perfecting the damaged formation in his mind.

After a long time, he finally completed the restoration.

The masters fell silent, their spirits somewhat dampened by the realization of how difficult the problem had been.

Du Wan watched Yang Kai's expressions closely; the other four looked dejected because even combined they could not complete the formation—truly a bitter blow.

"Any leads?" Du Wan suddenly asked.

Yang Kai nodded lightly. "Yes."

The four were stunned and looked at him in surprise. Hong Fang asked, "You couldn't have unraveled its secret, could you?"

He Feng even shouted, "Young man—don't spout boasts! We've all been stumped by this; how could you have solved it?"

"Whether it's boastful, you'll see," Du Wan said with a chuckle.

Yang Kai remained composed, took several fine jade pieces from the Black Book Space, held them in his palm, and used his Divine Sense as a pen to leave marks upon the stones.

After a moment he handed the jade to Du Wan: "Once dismantled, the several spirit formation diagrams are all here, but to know what each is for you'll need to verify them through alchemy. I hope they're of use to you masters."

Du Wan accepted them solemnly, kept one jade for himself, hurriedly examined it, and distributed the rest to the other four.

Seeing both elder and youth wearing serious expressions, the others fell silent and probed the jades with their minds.

After a moment, their faces displayed a rich array of emotions, excitement most of all.

The jade stones passed between the five; after inspecting the formations contained within, He Feng could not help muttering, "You really solved it?"

The scattered formations, once assembled, matched the hide's array—not only completed and perfected, but also featuring some ingenious constructions.

That the year-long problem of these Saint-Grade alchemists could be resolved so readily left them almost incredulous.

"Boy, how do you know these? These should be long-lost spirit formations. At your age you couldn't have had the chance to learn them," He Feng stared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai hesitated, then said, "I won't hide it: I once received guidance from Elder Li and studied with him for a time."

"Elder Li? Tianzang Elder?" Kong Ruoyu exclaimed.

"No way?" another voice echoed.

"You met that master?"

"Where did you meet him? What does he look like?"

At that point they abandoned all airs of reserve and clamored excitedly.

Yang Kai looked toward Du Wan for help; Du Wan quickly cleared his throat, "Actually... I have seen him too."

"Du Wan, stop boasting!" He Feng scoffed, clearly disbelieving.

"It's true," Du Wan swore. "In Fuyun City, Elder Li was present as well, though he did not reveal his identity."

Yang Kai asked, "Do you all remember the other young alchemist at the conference who matched me?"

"I remember!" Hong Fang replied after a moment's thought. "I recall he was being protected by several experts from the city lord's manor... how does that concern Elder Li?"

"Oh—he's Elder Li's closed-door disciple!"

"What? A closed-door disciple?"

"No wonder... no wonder such a young man had such alchemical skill. I always suspected some high figure had trained him."

"That young man was lucky to be taken by someone like Elder Li; his future is boundless."

They sighed and murmured, evidently envious of Zhai Yao's good fortune.

"After that I studied under Elder Li for a time; yes, those formations came from him, which is why I could complete it," Yang Kai explained.

"I see..." He Feng rubbed his chin and appeared convinced; even Du Wan nodded slightly, his doubts dispelled.

But thinking how they once stood so close to Elder Li and never sought him out, He Feng and the others were filled with regret and envy, gnashing their teeth for a time.
