## Chapter 660 — Accidentally Killed a Saint Realm Expert

If Yang Kai was not mistaken, the beautiful woman looked at him with considerable respect.

This left him somewhat puzzled.

"Are you human or demon?" Chu Jian's eyes trembled violently; his face went pale as he demanded angrily.

"Who can say." Yang Kai drew a soft breath and gave Chu Jian a grin.

"How do you know Demon God Transformation? Where did your Demon Mark come from? Why is your demonic aura purer and far more massive than mine?" Chu Jian wore an expression of utter bewilderment, accusing him with bitter anguish.

"No comment." Yang Kai shrugged and walked toward him step by step, sneering, "We have no grudge, but you put me in a hard spot and even tried to kill me — that will cost you."

"You dare!" Chu Jian roared, veins bulging with fury.

Watching that human approach and feeling the murderous intent surging from his heart, Chu Jian naturally understood what he intended to do.

Bones clattered throughout his body, the demonic pattern on his face flickering; no matter how hard Chu Jian tried, he could not summon any strength.

It was as if, under that human's influence, all his power had been sealed within his body, beyond his control.

This discovery left Chu Jian both astonished and enraged; he glared at Yang Kai with a ferocious, distorted face and asked in a low voice, "You despicable human, what did you do to me? Why can't I raise any strength?"

"So you really can't draw power; I thought it might have been an illusion, but it seems it's true." Yang Kai nodded lightly, his expression settled.

He had been approaching slowly on purpose, to pressurize Chu Jian, probe his reactions, and test whether his feeling was correct.

Now it seemed all of it was true — there was no longer any reason for him to fear them.

"Kill him for me!" Chu Jian's tone turned icy as he shouted to his subordinates. He sensed that if this human was not killed here, he himself might forever be restrained.

Chu Jian still could not fathom what method that human had used to bind his power.

What drove Chu Jian to despair was that his subordinates — whether peak Divine Roaming Realm cultivators or Transcendent Realm experts — all stood like wooden posts, rooted to the spot and unable to move, forced to watch Yang Kai's arrogant actions with helpless eyes.

"No one can save you!" Yang Kai barked; his speed increased markedly and, a moment later, he arrived before Chu Jian, his expression brutal and cold: "Today you will surely die."

Saying so, he showed no hesitation; a dense, sinister demonic qi surged from behind him, and accompanied by a piercing dragon cry, a pitch-black, enormous Jiao slowly appeared, coiling above Yang Kai's head, its copper-gong eyes staring down at Chu Jian.

"You can't kill me—I'm Saint Realm. My body is a million times harder than rock; just you—"

Swoosh...

A dark energy, like a slithering spirit-snake, shot toward Chu Jian and effortlessly tore a hole in his shoulder.

Chu Jian's voice cut off abruptly as he felt agony in his shoulder; his eyes trembled violently, staring at Yang Kai, his lips trembling.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh...

Wave after wave of energy battered Chu Jian; soon his robust body was riddled with holes, blood pouring out in streams, dyeing him crimson.

Yet the Ancient Demon Clan's formidable physique allowed Chu Jian to remain standing despite such grievous wounds.

"Saint Realm!" Yang Kai's mouth curved; he looked at Chu Jian with mockery, "Come to think of it, I have never devoured a Saint Realm master's Divine Sense before — I wonder what that tastes like. You're fortunate to be the first; I'll make full use of your insights and states of comprehension."

"What do you intend?" Chu Jian's face changed drastically. At his level, even if the body were destroyed, the spirit could escape and inhabit another place. Like when Di Mo once tried to possess Yang Kai, Chu Jian also planned to flee his ruined body.

His clanmates around him would be his targets; if he could secretly hide in one of them, a chance at resurgence remained. If he could discover the secret binding Yang Kai used and free himself, killing a Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage human brat like this would be effortless.

But Yang Kai's words made him instantly realize something was wrong.

It seemed the man meant not to spare even his Divine Sense.

At that moment, Chu Jian felt utter despair.

"You will find out soon enough." Yang Kai cracked a smile. The Black Jiao circling above him gave a high dragon roar, opened its blood-lined maw, and swallowed Chu Jian whole.

It was obvious Chu Jian struggled and resisted inside the dragon's belly, but with his power sealed he could not escape.

Gradually Chu Jian ceased moving; the Jiao collapsed and dissipated, and a bloodied, mangled corpse fell from midair.

"My lord!" Chu Jian's subordinates cried out in alarm, staring at the scene in disbelief.

A Saint Realm master of two stages had been killed without even the strength to resist.

Yang Kai's cunning and might chilled them to the bone.

From that corpse, a vast Divine Sense energy stealthily erupted — Chu Jian's spirit. He sought to flee into the body of one of his followers the instant Yang Kai had struck.

But as soon as his spirit left the Sea of Consciousness, he felt an immense pulling force nearby; this pull drew his spirit like a leash, and just as before he had no room to resist, now no matter how he struggled he could not break free.

In the haze, many seemed to have heard Chu Jian's lament.

Yang Kai felt an enormous Divine Sense energy added to his own Sea of Consciousness.

Inside that Sea of Consciousness, Chu Jian's spirit body appeared and cautiously looked around.

A sea of flame; the human's Sea of Consciousness contained thick power of fire that scorched Chu Jian's spirit, leaving him in unbearable agony.

At the center of that fiery sea stood a five-colored isle, exquisitely beautiful, like a fairyland.

In the sky above it hung a single, tightly closed eye.

The instant Chu Jian saw that eye he instinctively felt fear and submission; before he could steady his mind, the closed eye slowly opened.

Its golden, narrow pupil radiated limitless majesty.

A beam of golden light shot from the lone eye and struck Chu Jian's spirit body.

Unimaginable pain followed as his spirit was purified; Chu Jian screamed, and memories of records he had read years ago flashed through his mind. He widened his eyes and stared at the single eye in the sky, horrified: "World-Ending Demon Eye?"

So that was it!

In that instant he finally understood why the human could perform Demon God Transformation and why, like the Ancient Demon Clan's bane, no clan member could draw power in his presence.

He possessed the World-Ending Demon Eye!

The Great Demon God's majesty... is not to be violated.

Before his awareness fully vanished, Chu Jian saw and understood everything, but it was already too late.

Outside, those who had watched Yang Kai kill Chu Jian shuddered.

They were indeed warlike and fearless, but with a two-stage Saint Realm commander inexplicably slain, an unknown fear left them disoriented; when they turned to look at Yang Kai, their gazes changed, filled with terror and horror.

Yang Kai stood where he was, sensing the situation within the Sea of Consciousness. Only after Chu Jian's awareness was completely purified did he nod in satisfaction and cast a cold, grim look around.

His gaze was like a butcher eyeing lambs in a pen; those the gaze fixed on instinctively averted their eyes, unwilling to meet his stare.

He considered whether to finish off all of Chu Jian's followers.

It was not that he feared revenge; although these people had followed Chu Jian and opposed Li Rong, in the Ancient Demon Clan the strong always dominated, and warriors within the clan were free to change whom they followed.

If Li Rong's methods were sufficient, she could still bring these people to heel and make them obey.

And after witnessing today's events, they would likely not dare trouble Yang Kai again.

So whether he killed them or not, they would not be able to take revenge on him — Yang Kai was certain of that. Over the past year he had also learned much of the Ancient Demon Clan's habits and traits from Guan'er.

He would ask Li Rong first.

Yang Kai pondered, left those people behind, and strode steadily toward Li Rong.

"He's coming!" Hua Mo said in horror; as Yang Kai drew near, Hua Mo felt the suppressive force bearing down on him grow stronger. Earlier he could still summon some strength, but when Yang Kai closed to fifty zhang, Hua Mo found every step arduous; even moving a finger became extremely difficult.

"I'll negotiate with him; don't make a sound." Li Rong hurriedly warned, then turned to her clan and ordered, "Show him no hostility!"

She did not know what Yang Kai planned and naturally did not dare provoke him.

The clan members all nodded, their expressions grave.

"Lady Li!" Yang Kai's presence eased Li Rong slightly; he stopped three zhang away and greeted her with an affable tone.

"Don't call me 'Lady' — just call me Li Rong." She forced a smile and carefully watched Yang Kai's reactions.

Yang Kai was taken aback for a moment and then nodded: "I accidentally killed one of your clan's Saint Realm experts. How should this be accounted for?"

"He deserved to die!" Li Rong answered quickly.

A trace of satisfaction crossed Yang Kai's face; he could sense Li Rong's words were sincere, not mere politeness. He smiled faintly: "So you won't blame me?"

"Why should I blame you?"

Yang Kai gave a soft laugh, his eyes narrowing: "No matter the feud between you and Chu Jian, it was an internal struggle; I am an outsider. Now that Chu Jian died at my hands, somebody in the clan might seek vengeance. If I make enemies, I prefer to eradicate them root and branch."

Li Rong's expression shifted slightly. She said in a low voice, "I can guarantee that no one will trouble you over this."

Yang Kai's words had clearly sown suspicion in even her mind.

"Oh?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

"Before today you may have been an outsider to my clan, but from today on, you are no longer an outsider."
