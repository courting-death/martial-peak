## Chapter 1720 — Colluding with the Sea Race

As Yang Kai had fused the Spatial Force of his domain into the Shi field, so too did Su Yan fuse the profound intent of ice and snow into the Shi field; she had evidently already grasped the mysteries of icy cold at a preliminary level, her domain reaching into the subtleties of the Shi field.

He watched quietly for a while and found that Su Yan showed no sign of stopping her cultivation; she must have reached a critical moment.

Yang Kai didn’t disturb her. Instead, he sat down cross-legged and began tracing lines of spiritual energy in the air before him.

Those threads, condensed from Saint Yuan, were arranged and combined according to a certain pattern, gradually forming an intricate formation.

After watching for a time, Yang Kai showed a dissatisfied expression, reached out and brushed the formation away, then began to etch it anew in the void.

This formation was what he had just learned from Yang Yan, the very foundation for constructing a Space Array; with this formation, together with some special materials, one could erect a Space Array for transmission.

Yang Kai had never delved into the art of formations before.

But he possessed an advantage others did not: mastery of Spatial Force, so studying a Space Array alone posed no great problem, especially with Yang Yan’s careful guidance.

Time flowed slowly; Yang Kai lost himself in his work, his expression growing ever more focused.

He did not know how many formations he had etched before a moment arrived when he displayed extreme satisfaction; his Divine Sense shifted and he poured his own Spatial Force into the formation.

With a faint hum the formation flared with startling light, and the entire pattern began to rotate at a strange speed.

Clear ripples of Spatial Force surged forth from the formation!

Yang Kai grinned broadly.

Indeed, after mastering Spatial Force, researching corresponding formations yielded twice the result with half the effort; had he switched to other kinds of formations, even with systematic study he might not have completed one in so short a time.

With this foundation mastered, the remaining work was to use materials to build the frame of the formation, fuse the foundation with that frame, and then connect two or more Space Arrays together to enable transmission across distance.

Yang Kai exhaled softly.

"Is this a Space Array?" Su Yan’s voice suddenly came from beside him.

Yang Kai looked up and found that at some point she had already finished cultivating. She was now standing quietly beside him, gazing at the glowing, rotating array ahead, and softly asked:

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded, pulled Su Yan into his arms, and asked in a soft voice, "How went your cultivation?"

"Not bad; I should soon be able to bring my Shi field to fruition." Su Yan leaned against Yang Kai, a contented look on her face, exhaling like a breeze: "This is all thanks to the Domain Stones you gave me, Junior Brother; without them I couldn’t have progressed so quickly."

"There are many Domain Stones; don’t feel you need to conserve them." Yang Kai smiled lightly, his body and mind thoroughly relaxed.

"Mm, you came to see me this time. Is there something you need?"

"Nothing, I just haven’t seen you in a while, so I came to visit." Yang Kai chuckled.

Su Yan nodded lightly and looked up at the clouds rolling by; her eyes narrowed a little. Her supple body shifted in Yang Kai’s arms to a more comfortable position.

Yang Kai held her close and said nothing more; together they looked up at the sky.

Beneath the silver giant tree, the snow slid down and all was silent; the scene was like a painting.

From afar, Qing Ya appeared to be coming to visit Su Yan, but upon seeing that warm scene she pursed her lips in a smile and quietly turned away.

……

Half a month later, on the Wuyou Sea, at the Sea Hall’s main headquarters on Black Reef Island.

Black Reef Island was one of the major islands in the Wuyou Sea, large enough to rank among the top three; most notably, its heaven‑and‑earth Spiritual Qi was exceptionally fine, which was why the Sea Hall had set its main headquarters on the island.

As the main headquarters, the island was heavily guarded; cultivators often flew about the skies to patrol the surroundings, and Sea Hall disciples stood watch along the island’s edges—no unauthorized persons were allowed entry.

Yang Kai flew over leisurely and landed on Black Reef Island.

Immediately a squad of Sea Hall disciples surrounded him; the leader glared at Yang Kai with an unfriendly look and barked, "Who goes there? State your name!"

On another’s territory, Yang Kai did not wish to make a fuss; he cupped his fists slightly and said, "Yang Kai, Sect Master of the Lingxiao Sect, here to pay respects to Elder Sha and to fulfill a prior agreement—please inform him."

"Sect Master of the Lingxiao Sect?"

"Here to see Elder Sha?"

The squad burst into commotion; the leader sized Yang Kai up as if to see whether he was lying, even releasing Divine Sense to scan him.

But their probe could not discern Yang Kai’s true depth, and they immediately realized his strength was beyond their ability to investigate; their demeanor turned solemn. After a moment of thought the leader said, "If you know Elder Sha has returned, then you must know him; but Elder Sha only recently returned to the Sea Hall and is very busy—whether he can see you I must ask him."

"No matter, I’ll wait here." Yang Kai said amiably.

The leader nodded and instructed his men to receive Yang Kai, then took out a Transmission Compass and poured his Divine Sense into it.

After a moment, the Transmission Compass in his hand gave off a surge of soul‑vibration; he checked quickly, and then looked at Yang Kai with a strange expression: "Wait here a moment; someone will come see you."

Yang Kai frowned slightly but remained calm: "Very well."

He instinctively felt this visit might not go smoothly, and that the person who came to see him might not be Sha Hu.

After all, with the relationship he had with Sha Hu, if Sha Hu had known he was here he would not have left him waiting—he would have already instructed someone to welcome him warmly.

There seemed to be some unrest within the Sea Hall. Yang Kai pondered inwardly, but it was none of his business; his visit was only to fulfill his agreement with Sha Hu so that inland and deep‑sea resources could be mutually exchanged, which would greatly aid the future development of the Lingxiao Sect.

As Yang Kai had suspected, he had not waited even a quarter‑hour when he sensed a group of Origin Returning Realm experts swiftly flying this way; however, in his perception Sha Hu’s presence was absent among them.

Soon that group came into view for Yang Kai.

Their leader was a powerful cultivator of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, an elder with a dark complexion who drifted down some ten zhang before Yang Kai; his seemingly cloudy eyes appraised Yang Kai a few times, then he casually cupped his fists: "May I ask if you are the Sect Master of the Lingxiao Sect?"

"That is correct, I am Yang Kai. Elder, may I ask who you are?" Yang Kai returned the salute.

"I am Qi Yunhai, the Sea Hall’s Third Hall Master!" the elder said lightly.

"So you are Hall Master Qi!" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow; although his dealings with the Sea Hall had been limited, he knew the Sea Hall had three Hall Masters, and this Qi Yunhai was clearly one of them.

"I heard Sect Master Yang has come to see our Sea Hall’s Senior Uncle Sha?"

"Exactly; I made an agreement with Elder Sha—may I ask whether Elder Sha…"

"Senior Uncle went missing for over three hundred years and has only just returned to the Sea Hall; he is physically and mentally exhausted and is recuperating—he will probably not be able to receive Sect Master Yang." Qi Yunhai’s tone was indifferent. "Sect Master Yang is a distant guest—if you do not mind, why not come inside and sit a while? Though I have long dwelt in the deep sea, I have long heard of Sect Master Yang and the Lingxiao Sect’s great name; it has been my regret never to have met you. Your arrival gives me the chance to be satisfied."

His words were courteous, but his tone was neither warm nor cold; it was clear he was not sincerely inviting Yang Kai inside.

Yang Kai glanced at Qi Yunhai and smiled wryly: "That is strange—when I parted with Elder Sha on Xiaguang Island half a month ago he was perfectly fine; why now is he suddenly so weary? Besides, Elder Sha and I have an agreement; I came to fulfill it. Hall Master Qi, are you saying Elder Sha’s inability to see me is his own decision?"

A flash of sharp light passed through Qi Yunhai’s cloudy eyes; he did not answer directly but demanded, his tone pressing: "What do you mean by that, Sect Master?"

"Nothing." Yang Kai curled his lips. "The agreement between Elder Sha and me benefits not only the Lingxiao Sect but also the Sea Hall. If you refuse benefits offered on a silver platter, then I shall take my leave. The Wuyou Sea is not the domain of a single power!"

"You dare collude with the Sea Race?" Qi Yunhai thought for a moment and his face changed greatly.

"What do you mean by collude?" Yang Kai sneered. "If you insist on slapping such an absurd label on my head, farewell!"

Yang Kai’s anger flared; the last time on Xiaguang Island, Pang Zhen had sent word back to the Sea Hall and they had not responded—he had let that matter pass, but now that he had come in person he was being obstructed, and the one confronting him was a Hall Master, which to some extent represented the Sea Hall’s collective stance.

If the Sea Hall would not do business with the Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai saw no need to beg them.

"Planning to collude with the Sea Race and leave? Boy, unless you explain yourself clearly you won’t be leaving Black Reef Island today!" a stern roar suddenly came from nearby; as the voice fell, a burly middle‑aged man appeared beside Qi Yunhai, glaring coldly at Yang Kai.

Before Yang Kai could react, a thunderous bellow echoed from within Black Reef Island: "How dare you! Yang Kai is my guest—who dares be rude?"

Hearing that voice, Yang Kai smiled broadly and his displeasure eased; at last he had not been mistaken—Sha Hu had shown up and immediately stepped forward to defend him upon sensing his arrival.

The situation was somewhat complicated, Yang Kai thought.

He did not intend to interfere; he simply stood quietly and waited to hear what Sha Hu would say.

Over there, Sha Hu flew over with great momentum. In just a short moment, he landed beside Yang Kai, his face dark with anger as he glared fiercely at Qi Yunhai and the burly middle-aged man.

Qi Yunhai seemed unwilling to meet Sha Hu’s gaze, his eyes averting, while the burly middle‑aged man met Sha Hu without fear or retreat, staring him down.
