## Chapter 194 — Warm Spirit Lotus

At that time, this matter stirred up a great uproar overseas, causing various sects to lose face. The theft of treasures from over a dozen sects ignited their fury.

Forces from all sides gathered together, and the long-secluded old-timers emerged in unison, seeking to track down the thief and recover their lost items.

Efforts bore fruit; after several months of investigation, these sects finally found some clues. Various signs indicated that the person who had stolen treasures from over a dozen major sects was none other than the individual they had expelled from their mountain gate thirty years ago.

It was unclear what kind of fortuitous encounter this person had experienced, but in just thirty years, they had cultivated their strength to an unfathomable level.

At this point, the major sects understood why someone would dare to steal their treasures. It turned out that this person harbored resentment over being kicked out and sought to teach these arrogant sects a lesson.

When the experts from those sects confronted this individual to demand the return of their stolen items, they were met with refusal. A disagreement erupted into a deadly battle at sea.

This person single-handedly faced the combined assault of experts from over a dozen major sects. That battle shattered several isolated islands overseas, and the casualties among the sects were severe. As for whether the thief lived or died, no one knew.

After the experts who participated in that battle returned, they said nothing about the incident.

Some claimed he was killed, while others said he was severely injured and fled. The truth remained a mystery.

As time passed and the experts who had participated in the battle all perished, the matter gradually faded, yet the stolen items were never recovered.

Yang Kai initially thought this was merely a tale spun by predecessors, as many so-called extraordinary stories were fabricated by storytellers to make a living. Out of ten such tales, it would be lucky if three were true. Even those three, after countless retellings, lost their original flavor and were embellished with much exaggeration.

However, witnessing everything today, Yang Kai realized that it was not just a story, but a true event that had occurred.

The Tai Yi Sect's seal required the unique heart method of the Tai Yi Sect to activate, transforming it into a secret treasure for killing. At this moment, it lay atop a stone pedestal, covered in layer upon layer of dust.

The supreme techniques of Gu Yun Island, the secret treasures of the Shura Sect, the Blood Sea Begonia of the Falling Flower Sect...

Which of these was not worth its weight in gold? Which did not hold special and immense significance for these sects?

Even if some items on this stone pedestal held little intrinsic value, their mere presence here rendered them invaluable treasures to those sects!

It turned out that all the items stolen by that individual back then were stored here!

Yang Kai's emotions surged; he could imagine the tremendous shock these items would cause among the overseas forces if they were to resurface.

“Eh, the quality of these secret treasures is quite mediocre. Young Master, do you want to take a few for self-defense?” Di Mo suddenly asked.

There were not many secret treasures here, only three. Aside from the Tai Yi seal, which required a corresponding heart method to operate, Yang Kai could indeed take the other two if he truly wanted to. At the very least, these secret treasures were Heaven-Grade, which naturally tempted Yang Kai.

However, if he were to use them outside and reveal any flaws, it would only lead to trouble, so he hesitated.

Ignoring Di Mo's inquiry, Yang Kai returned the items in his hand to the stone pedestal and stepped inward.

After a short while, a rich and pure energy from heaven and earth surged toward him. Not far ahead, there seemed to be a dazzling array of colors, captivating to the heart.

Yang Kai's expression brightened, and his steps quickened significantly.

Turning a corner, he entered a place that resembled a living quarters, and the colorful light was emanating from this very location.

Looking up, Yang Kai saw a lotus flower about the size of a basin floating in mid-air, surrounded by a liquid-like substance enveloping the colorful lotus.

It appeared to be liquid, yet it was not water; instead, it gave Yang Kai an inexplicable sense of unease, as if his very soul were in a state of disarray.

“Warm Spirit Lotus!” Di Mo exclaimed in shock, “It’s actually the Warm Spirit Lotus! My heavens, this place has the Warm Spirit Lotus, and it’s a colorful one!”

“A treasure?” Yang Kai licked his lips, asking excitedly.

“Not just a treasure, it’s a supreme treasure, Young Master,” Di Mo stammered in excitement, “This is the Warm Spirit Lotus, something every martial artist dreams of. No matter how high your strength or cultivation level, this item will be of immense benefit to you. Damn it, how did I not find this thing back in the day?”

Yang Kai chuckled, “So you mean to say you can’t take it?”

Di Mo shivered, “Young Master, you jest. I am but a wisp of soul now; let alone taking it, if it touches me, I would probably be absorbed instead.”

“Tell me, what exactly is its use? You’re supposed to be an old demon; stop being so jumpy.”

Di Mo was momentarily speechless, thinking to himself that Yang Kai was blissfully ignorant of the rarity and preciousness of this item, which was why he remained so calm. If he knew its immense value, he would surely lose his composure like the old man.

Damn it, why didn’t I have such good luck? Instead, the Young Master is on a roll, having recently refined a wisp of Heavenly Dao energy to gain the power of flight, and now he encounters the Warm Spirit Lotus. How much luck does one need to have to strike such fortune consecutively?

Filled with envy and jealousy, Di Mo took a long time to regain his composure and cautiously said, “The Warm Spirit Lotus, as the name suggests, is a rare treasure for nurturing Divine Sense. Divine sense, Young Master, you know what that is, right? Although you are currently in the Qi Movement Realm and cannot cultivate Divine Sense, it still exists in your mind. Your perception stems from Divine Sense. Once you reach the Divine Roaming Realm, you can begin to cultivate it. The stronger your Divine Sense, the more benefits you will reap. When two equally matched individuals battle, the one with the stronger Divine Sense will undoubtedly have the upper hand.”

Yang Kai frowned, impatiently interrupting, “Get to the point!”

Did this old fellow think he was teaching a three-year-old? Although Yang Kai could not cultivate Divine Sense, he still understood its significance.

“Right,” Di Mo replied, feeling a bit annoyed, and continued, “Cultivating Divine Sense is extremely arduous, far more difficult than enhancing physical strength. However, certain rare treasures can enhance Divine Sense, and the Warm Spirit Lotus is the supreme item among them. Such treasures will never disappear or be refined. Once obtained, they will only exist in the martial artist's sea of Divine Sense, requiring no maintenance. They will continuously nourish and strengthen the martial artist's Divine Sense, allowing it to grow stronger and more solid over time.”

“It cannot be refined, nor will it disappear?”

“Exactly, because no one in this world can refine the Warm Spirit Lotus, not even those at the pinnacle of power!” Di Mo's tone was solemn, “This is a very special kind of rare treasure. In terms of value, it is far more precious than the Heaven-Devouring Insect you refined a while ago. Because it will accompany you throughout your life, from the moment you obtain it until the end of your life, it will nourish you, never ceasing or requiring any effort on your part. You simply need to enjoy the benefits.”

“What a good item, I want it!” Yang Kai's eyes lit up, and he immediately wanted to rush forward.

“Wait!” Di Mo shouted loudly, “Young Master, do not act recklessly.”

Di Mo was terrified; just a moment ago, Yang Kai had shown little interest, but suddenly he was filled with enthusiasm. The rapid change almost caught him off guard.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai asked, somewhat displeased.

“Young Master, do you see that there is a layer of liquid-like substance surrounding the Warm Spirit Lotus? Do you know what that is?” Di Mo inquired.

“What is it?”

“That is the sea of Divine Sense left behind by a powerful expert after their death! It contains their Divine Sense power. If you recklessly charge in with your Qi Movement Realm strength, you will likely die immediately!”

“Sea of Divine Sense?” Yang Kai was astonished, “Can a person's sea of Divine Sense be preserved after they die?”

The sea of Divine Sense is inherently ethereal and formless, a manifestation of mental power. When a person dies, their Divine Sense naturally cannot be preserved.

“Others cannot, but for those who possess the Warm Spirit Lotus, their sea of Divine Sense will be preserved after death. This is the power of the Warm Spirit Lotus,” Di Mo explained. “By the way, Young Master, if you obtain the Warm Spirit Lotus, when the day comes that you pass away, it will be the same.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but roll his eyes. Looking down, he indeed saw a withered skeleton beneath the Warm Spirit Lotus. It seemed that this skeleton was the infamous thief from years ago.

He died here, yet the Warm Spirit Lotus and his sea of Divine Sense remained.

Raising an eyebrow, Yang Kai asked, “Di Mo, don’t you need this kind of spiritual power?”

Di Mo chuckled awkwardly, “Young Master is correct. If you have no other instructions, I shall begin to devour this person's sea of Divine Sense.”

“How long will it take you?”

“Uncertain, perhaps a month,” Di Mo replied, “After all, this person was not weak in life, and with the Warm Spirit Lotus assisting, their sea of Divine Sense is quite substantial.”

“A month? Then I’ll help you guard!” Yang Kai nodded.

“No need, Young Master, just look over there. This place has more than just the Warm Spirit Lotus,” Di Mo said.

Yang Kai turned his head and saw a pure, misty energy swirling at the bottom of a nearby cave. Since entering this place, his attention had been captivated by the colorful lotus, and he hadn’t noticed much else.

“What is this?”

“Pure heaven and earth energy, also known as earth veins! Young Master, you’re fortunate; you can first absorb the energy from the earth veins to cultivate yourself. After I refine this sea of Divine Sense, you can come back for the Warm Spirit Lotus,” Di Mo explained.

“This is an earth vein?” Yang Kai was astonished. That thief from three hundred years ago truly found a great place to cultivate; no wonder he could reach a level that left the major sects helpless in just thirty years.

It turned out that not only did he have the Warm Spirit Lotus assisting him, but he also had this earth vein.

“It’s just a small earth vein, and it’s nearly depleted,” Di Mo replied.

“Alright, you go ahead and do your thing; don’t mind me.”

Di Mo was overjoyed and quickly wrapped the Soul-Breaking Spike before flying out, diving into the edge of the sea of Divine Sense to begin devouring. Yang Kai even heard him emit a satisfied and greedy sound, as if a starving ghost had finally embraced a beautiful maiden after years of yearning.
