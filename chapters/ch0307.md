## Chapter 307 — Just Listen

Inside the spider egg, Yang Kai scrutinized Shan Qingluo with suspicion, his expression peculiar as he said, “Beauty… you’re not suddenly fond of me, are you? Why are you being so nice to me all of a sudden?”

Shan Qingluo's face turned slightly red, and she shot him a glare, “So what if I am?”

Yang Kai was at a loss whether to laugh or cry, “Isn’t this like an old cow eating tender grass? Ouch… that hurts!”

Shan Qingluo smirked coldly, twisting the flesh on Yang Kai's chest without letting go, gritting her teeth as she said, “So what if an old cow eats tender grass? It’s your fortune that I can take a liking to you!”

“I can’t handle it!” Yang Kai looked at her incredulously, unable to believe it, “Even if you like me, I can’t really do anything to you. Why must you come to tease and torment me?”

Shan Qingluo's face turned cold as she looked at him with a murderous gaze, “You’ve done so many bad things to me, my body has almost been touched all over, kisses have been exchanged, and now you still want to hold onto me without letting go. You think you can just deny it?”

“Isn’t it just a few touches? Is it necessary to pin it on me?” Yang Kai forced a smile, his expression turning serious, “Besides, I’m still so young and inexperienced. Before meeting you, my body and mind were pure and untainted. You kissed me too, so if we really count it, you’ve taken advantage of me. Let’s just not mention it and call it even.”

“You little rascal, full of bad intentions, your techniques are so skilled. How can you say you’re inexperienced?” Shan Qingluo glared at Yang Kai in anger, then suddenly smiled sweetly, “The lineage of the Poison Widow only falls in love with one man in a lifetime. You’ve made me feel that way, so you can forget about escaping this life!”

“Damn it, is there no justice left?!” Yang Kai lamented.

Shan Qingluo covered her mouth and giggled, her smile like a blooming flower, her expression revealing a hint of cunning satisfaction.

At that moment, a piercing scream suddenly echoed from outside.

All those who had regained consciousness changed their expressions drastically, straining to listen. They could hear the sounds of something being sliced through, and through the layers of spider silk, they seemed to see bright red blood splattering.

“Master… don’t come out easily, they’re right outside, ah…” a person screamed in horror, and soon there was no more sound.

After a moment, a sound resembling something being chewed came through.

Shan Qingluo's complexion slightly paled, and her supple body instinctively shrank into Yang Kai's embrace.

“It’s people from the Bai Family…” Luo Xiaoman’s faint sobs and gasps came from the right. Although this girl had a large chest, she was timid. For the past month, she had been in a state of panic, her nerves stretched to the limit.

Usually, with Qiu Yimeng to comfort her, it wasn’t much of a problem, but now suddenly wrapped in spider silk and far from Qiu Yimeng, being alone made her unable to bear such pressure.

“Xiao Man, don’t cry, or you might attract those spiders!” Qiu Yimeng whispered urgently.

But how could Luo Xiaoman hold back? Although she covered her mouth with her hands, her cries grew louder. A spider the size of a calf swayed in front of her. Frightened, Luo Xiaoman let out a piercing scream and fainted.

It’s over! Everyone felt that this woman was likely to be done in by the spider.

Even Yang Kai couldn’t help but hold his breath, listening carefully to the surrounding sounds.

Unexpectedly, the spider that had approached Luo Xiaoman merely turned around and leisurely left.

“Whew…” A sigh of relief came from Qiu Yimeng, a wave of fear washing over her. When she came to her senses, she realized her clothes were soaked through, her body icy cold.

“It seems as long as we don’t break the spider silk, it doesn’t matter if we speak loudly,” Yang Kai mused.

The martial artist from the Bai Family had clearly used some method to escape the spider silk, which led to his untimely demise.

Hearing this, everyone couldn’t help but feel slightly more relaxed, heavy breaths echoing from all directions. Before this, they had been desperately suppressing their breathing and heartbeats.

“Brother Gu. Brother Gu…” Yuan Shi’s voice came through.

“I’m here!” Gu Yuanming quickly responded, whispering, “Is everyone alright?”

“No!” Gu Tianluo also answered.

“We’re just wrapped in this spider silk, unable to move for the time being.” Yuan Shi’s cold voice came, “We can break free, but Brother Gu, what about those spiders outside? How do we defend ourselves?”

Gu Yuanming was also at a loss. With twenty to thirty Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts, they only had five or six in the Divine Roaming Realm, which was simply not enough. Moreover, those spiders were incredibly precise with their webs. Even if they could fly, escaping wasn’t guaranteed.

“Damn it, this time we’ve really suffered a huge loss!” Yuan Shi cursed angrily, “How could there be a nest of spiders here?”

Hearing this frantic voice, Shan Qingluo chuckled lightly, mocking, “Karma!”

Gu Yuanming couldn’t help but curse, “You vile woman! You better pray that I don’t escape. If I do, one day I will make you suffer and beg for mercy beneath me!”

Shan Qingluo’s expression turned cold, taking a deep breath. She wanted to say something more but held it back.

Everyone couldn’t act now. In a verbal battle, women were never a match for men. No matter how many filthy words were thrown, it was always the woman who suffered.

“Haha.” Seeing her silent, Yuan Shi laughed heartily, “Brother Gu, that vile woman is famous for her beauty. You alone might not be her match. Be careful she doesn’t drain you dry!”

Gu Tianluo chimed in, “Brother Gu is not alone; we have so many brothers here.”

“Exactly! Once we break free, we’ll have over ten brothers lined up to take turns with her, not letting her rest for a moment. I want to see how long the world’s most enchanting woman can last!”

“By the way, Brother Yu, didn’t you practice the Yin-Yang technique? I wonder if your skill is superior, or if our lady’s alluring arts are better.”

Brother Yu laughed, “In terms of techniques, how can I compare to that vile woman? It is said that she indulges every night, keeping many handsome men in her palace. Every day, young men drained of their essence are taken out and thrown into the mass grave. However, if I don’t use my technique, I’m confident I can make that vile woman lose control!”

“Haha! Brother Yu, you have such spirit!”

“Brother Ban, you flatter me. A few days ago, I took in several adopted daughters, each one pure and beautiful. After we break free, I’m willing to offer those daughters to all of you brothers for your enjoyment.”

“Brother Yu is quite loyal!” Gu Yuanming praised, though trapped, he couldn’t help but breathe heavily, leering as he said, “Then when the time comes, we’ll strip the lady of her powers, feed her aphrodisiacs, and while we enjoy Brother Yu’s daughters, we can also appreciate her reactions.”

“Hehe, by then, I’m afraid the lady will be crying and begging us to have her!”

“Play with her a thousand times, then sell her to the lowest brothel in the world, letting those commoners and beggars taste her beauty. After three to five years, the world’s most charming woman will likely become a rotting piece of meat that even wild dogs won’t want to smell!”

“Hahaha…”

…

Filthy words grew increasingly vulgar and unrestrained. This group of experts from the Cangyun Evil Land, unable to escape, found solace in their misery, continuously teasing and mocking Shan Qingluo.

Hearing those words, Shan Qingluo’s face grew paler, her breathing gradually becoming heavier. Her delicate body trembled uncontrollably, her beautiful eyes filled with killing intent, clearly enraged.

Yang Kai’s expression also darkened as he listened.

“I want to kill them! I will kill them sooner or later!” Shan Qingluo gritted her teeth, her fists clenched tightly, murmuring to herself. As the Enchantress Queen, she had never encountered a man who dared to look her in the eye, let alone hear such filthy words. Yet this time, having fallen into a trap, she was humiliated by a few small fry under the Beast Kings.

“I’ll help you vent your anger!” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

“What?” Shan Qingluo looked up at him.

“Just listen!” Yang Kai smiled mysteriously, his expression gradually turning cold.

That group continued their raucous revelry, spewing filthy words, indulging in their release. Suddenly, a scream pierced the air.

The conversation came to an abrupt halt.

“Brother Yuan, what happened to you?” Gu Yuanming exclaimed in shock. He recognized the voice as Yuan Shi’s, but when he called out, there was no response.

“Brother Yuan!”

Several people called out, but Yuan Shi remained unresponsive.

An ominous feeling slowly enveloped everyone, and before they could figure out what had happened, another scream echoed.

This time it was Brother Yu, who shouted, “Get away! I didn’t go out, how could I be attacked while staying here?”

As he spoke, Brother Yu unleashed a martial technique.

This was disastrous. The surrounding eight-legged spiders reacted instantly, all crawling towards him. Brother Yu didn’t have time to react before he was completely torn apart.

Everyone fell silent, no one daring to speak.

Shan Qingluo's beautiful eyes sparkled with intrigue as she glanced at Yang Kai, unsure if this was somehow related to him.

Yang Kai grinned and softly said, “It’s not over yet.”

As he spoke, a terrified shout came from the other side, “Brother Ban, a spider is coming your way!”

“What?” In the midst of the panic, Brother Ban was unwilling to sit idly by. He hurriedly circulated his True Yuan, violently tearing through the spider silk. Just as he poked his head out, a sharp spider leg slashed down.

In the blink of an eye, his head rolled to the ground, blood spraying like a fountain.

“What’s going on?” Gu Yuanming shouted in disbelief.

He had thought speaking wouldn’t be a problem, but unexpectedly, it still attracted the spiders’ attention.

Ahead, a commotion arose. Through the hazy white spider silk, Gu Yuanming saw a massive creature standing before him, clearly a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast.

“Everyone, these spiders have started killing! Hurry and run!” Gu Yuanming shouted in confusion. With a loud crash, he broke through the spider silk and engaged the eight-legged spider in battle, using the momentum to soar into the sky.

Seeing Gu Yuanming act so decisively, the others didn’t dare hesitate any longer, each using their methods to escape, closely following his lead.

Puff puff puff…

Below, twenty to thirty Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts were glaring hungrily, simultaneously spitting out webs into the air. Those who had taken flight were quickly ensnared, falling to the ground like dumplings.
