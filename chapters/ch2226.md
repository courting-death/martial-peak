## Chapter 2226 — Heavenly Yao Valley

This unexpected calamity left Xiao Baiyi and the other two both helpless and secretly anxious.

They had no idea what had happened to Yang Kai and Xia Sheng, or whether their lives were in danger.

As the three exchanged silent glances, a burly figure suddenly appeared not far away. The figure was immensely robust, with a head of fiery red hair, and as he walked over, he carried a martial artist in his arms.

Xiao Baiyi and the other two fixed their eyes on him, and their expressions changed at once.

They saw that the person being carried was none other than Xia Sheng, and the one who had captured him was likely the Lian Yan they had heard about earlier.

An Emperor Realm expert had acted personally. Even though Xia Sheng was quite strong, he still could not escape this calamity and was captured along with the others.

Judging by his expression and condition, he had clearly put up quite a fight earlier, but now he was already badly injured.

Lian Yan carried Xia Sheng over, tossed him into the crowd, ordered his subordinates to keep watch, and then strode straight toward Zhou Dian, standing silently behind him.

Murong Xiaoxiao and the others had wanted to ask about Xia Sheng’s condition and injuries, but when they saw Xia Sheng slowly shake his head at them, they quickly fell silent.

At this moment, it was best not to reveal that they knew each other. If they concealed this, perhaps they could do something while the enemy was unprepared…

A gentle breeze brushed across their faces, bringing a rare sense of ease. Yet behind Zhou Dian, Lian Yan stood stiff and uneasy, his face taut with tension and anxiety.

He could feel the almost tangible fighting intent emanating from Zhou Dian—a strong expert’s instinctive thirst for battle.

Lian Yan knew exactly what Zhou Dian was longing for…

Since the founding of the Divine Kingdom and the unification of the world, there had been no more wars. As a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert, Zhou Dian had no rivals in the world except for a handful of other experts.

Among those few, one was right here in this Heavenly Yao Mountain.

Zhou Dian’s bloodlust, dormant for two thousand years, was awakening once again.

Lian Yan knew well how terrifying Zhou Dian was at this moment, so even as a direct subordinate, he dared not disturb him in the slightest, lest the consequences be unimaginable.

As time passed, that fighting intent fluctuated unpredictably.

Until at a certain moment the intense fighting intent suddenly vanished, leaving no trace.

Lian Yan couldn’t help but exhale, feeling almost drained.

“How is the situation?” Zhou Dian asked without turning his head.

“Reporting to my lord, the situation is still acceptable,” Lian Yan replied with a respectful bow.

“Still acceptable?” Zhou Dian turned, glancing sideways at Lian Yan.

That look and tone made Lian Yan’s face change dramatically. He quickly cupped his fists and said, “Only Ban Qing… has lost contact.”

Hearing this, Zhou Dian raised his eyebrows and said, “How could that be?”

“I don’t know either,” Lian Yan replied, looking confused. “Earlier, he would occasionally send me messages, but at a certain point, he just vanished. Maybe he’s tracking some formidable opponent.”

Zhou Dian nodded, “Mm, Ban Qing’s concealment technique is unmatched in the world. For him to be so cautious, it must be an extraordinary opponent. Enough, this Lord has rested long enough. Since the King has given the order, I suppose I’ll have to go in person this time!”

As he spoke, he urged the Nine-Resonance Kui Dragon Beast beneath him forward, striding deeper into Heavenly Yao Mountain.

"My lord!" Lian Yan called out urgently.

"What is it?" Zhou Dian looked back at him impatiently.

Lian Yan said, “Any further and we’ll be entering the range of the Yao Pact… If we trespass, the yao on that side…”

“Would this Lord fear the yao?” Zhou Dian sneered, looking at Lian Yan with mockery. “Lian Yan, you’ve grown timid.”

Lian Yan’s expression shifted several times. Suddenly, he gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, “I will accompany my lord.”

Zhou Dian stared at him deeply, nodded with satisfaction, and said, “Very good, keep up!”

With that, he continued forward. The Nine-Resonance Kui Dragon Beast’s movements seemed slow, but its speed increased rapidly. In just a moment, it turned into a streak of light, traversing a thousand zhang in an instant.

…

Deep within the Heavenly Yao Mountain lay the Heavenly Yao Valley.

This was the very heart of Heavenly Yao Mountain, and also the residence of its master.

The place followed the yao’s bold, unrestrained architectural style. All the buildings were grand and imposing, completely different from human constructions.

Outside the valley, a squad of elite Blood Wolf Clan guards, all at the peak of the Eleventh-Tier, stood watch, preventing outsiders from entering.

Yuan Fei and Bai Lu led Yang Kai all the way here without obstruction. Even within Heavenly Yao Mountain, these two were famous figures, trusted aides of the Yao King. Who would dare block their way?

However, the many yao experts looked at Yang Kai with curiosity and hostility. As they went deeper, every yao they encountered glared at Yang Kai, baring their teeth. If he hadn’t been following two Emperor Realm experts, he would likely have been torn to pieces.

Before long, the group arrived at the center of Heavenly Yao Valley.

Here stood a colossal tree that reached the sky. Its roots were as wide as several great halls. When Yang Kai looked up, he couldn’t even see the treetop. The vast canopy covered dozens of li in every direction.

This magnificent sight left Yang Kai clicking his tongue in wonder.

Moreover, upon arriving here, Yang Kai clearly felt the Heaven-and-Earth Energy in the area become much denser, making his Spirit Body feel comfortable.

He immediately understood that this giant tree was likely a divine object.

At the base of the tree, on one side, there was a large wooden door, tightly shut. When they reached it, Yuan Fei turned to Yang Kai and said fiercely, “Brat, wait here and don’t move unless you’re called. If you lose your life, you’ll have no one to blame but yourself!”

Yang Kai nodded calmly, unperturbed.

"Zhi zhi zhi…" The Purple Civet called out to Yang Kai for a moment, seemingly wanting to say something.

Yang Kai smiled and nodded, saying, “Don’t worry about me. Just take care of yourself.”

“Let’s go!” Bai Lu said, pushing open the door and entering the revealed tree hollow.

In a short while, only Yang Kai was left at the spot.

He looked up at the giant tree, eyes full of amazement. Meanwhile, the surrounding yao began to gather, their eyes flashing with malice.

In just ten breaths, Yang Kai was surrounded three layers deep, even the branches above were filled with yao experts, looking down at him from above.

Some of these yao experts had taken human form, while others remained in their beast forms—muscular and fierce.

But regardless of who they were, they only stared at Yang Kai, showing obvious hostility, but did not actually attack.

After all, Yang Kai had been brought back by Yuan Fei and Bai Lu. Without their word, the other yao dared not act rashly.

Among the yao, the hierarchy was even more pronounced than among humans. The strong had absolute authority over the weak, unless, like the Purple Civet, one had extremely powerful parents.

This scene made Yang Kai recall the past.

He realized that wherever he went, there seemed to be irreconcilable conflict between humans and yao. Different races, different views—this truth held everywhere: those not of our kind must have different hearts.

Surrounded by countless yao experts, Yang Kai showed no fear, but the Soul-Devouring Worms hidden in his sleeve suddenly became restless. Perhaps the presence of so many experts’ Divine Soul Origins excited them, and they almost surged out uncontrollably.

Sensing this, Yang Kai’s expression changed. He quickly used his soul power to suppress them.

At the instant the Soul-Devouring Worms stirred, all the yao experts felt as if they had fallen into an ice cellar, their bodies turning cold. The feeling was inexplicable, but their instincts told them that something threatening their lives had appeared.

This discovery made the many yao experts look grim, eyeing Yang Kai with suspicion and vigilance, as if reassessing him.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai was doing his utmost to suppress the Soul-Devouring Worms. With so many eyes on him, he couldn’t use the Warm Spirit Lotus’s power, and for a moment, he was at a loss.

Just then, a vast, ocean-like pressure suddenly descended from above, enveloping Yang Kai.

The pressure came so abruptly that Yang Kai was pinned in place before he could react.

But he soon realized that the pressure did him no harm. Instead, the Soul-Devouring Worms instantly calmed down.

It seemed the owner of the pressure had intentionally helped him.

Third Stage of the Emperor Realm! Yang Kai was shocked.

He had guessed that the master of Heavenly Yao Mountain would be extremely powerful, but now that he sensed the other’s cultivation, he was still deeply shaken.

This was just the world of the Divine Roaming Mirror, a strange land where all living beings had no fleshly bodies. Yet even here, such powerful experts existed.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but lose himself in thought, wondering if a Great Emperor had ever been born here.

If so, how much did they know about his situation?

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, a figure suddenly appeared before him—Bai Lu, emerging abruptly.

After glancing around, Bai Lu said to Yang Kai, “Come with me. The Lord wants to see you.”

“Thank you, Senior!” Yang Kai cupped his fists in salute.

Bai Lu said no more and turned to lead the way.

Yang Kai followed her into the tree hollow.

Only then did he discover that the inside of the tree was a world of its own.

The lowest level seemed to be a grand hall, but it was empty. In one corner, a spiraling staircase led upward, its end out of sight no matter how high he looked.
