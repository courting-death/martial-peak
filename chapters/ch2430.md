## Chapter 2430 — Wenqing Finger

It was as if a miniature Star Domain had appeared above each person’s head, mysterious and wondrous beyond words.

A mysterious and ever-changing aura flowed out from the starlight gate, and as soon as everyone sensed it, their spirits were instantly roused.

In the next instant, the starlight gate descended, directly enveloping the dozen or so people present.

Dazzling light burst forth, so bright that no one could open their eyes. When the light finally faded, all those who had been shrouded in starlight had vanished without a trace.

The same scene was unfolding across the Star Realm. In the four Great Territories, thousands upon thousands of Dao Origin Realm cultivators entered the Shattered Star Sea.

On the viewing platform in Binglun City, Feng Xuan shot a cold glance at Bing Yun, then stood up and drifted away.

He didn’t utter a single unnecessary word as he left.

At this point, there was no meaning in saying anything more. The young people had already entered the Shattered Star Sea, and the marriage between Wenqing Sect and Ice Heart Valley could only be discussed after Feng Xi and Zi Yu returned safely. If even one of them perished inside, the marriage would be called off.

Bing Yun clearly had no intention of stopping him either. Although she did not fear Feng Xuan, at their level of strength and status, every word and action carried immense weight.

……

In the cold, empty void, shattered stars lay desolate and bleak, with not a trace of Spiritual Qi. Starry Sky storms howled through, sweeping everything before them. The vast Meteorite Sea stretched endlessly, like a river that would never see its end, spanning the world between heaven and earth.

All around was absolute silence, as if the world had not yet been divided, heaven and earth not yet formed, everything still in primordial chaos.

Suddenly, in a certain spot in the void, light flared. When it faded, Yang Kai appeared out of nowhere.

Earlier, when he was wrapped in starlight atop the arena, he immediately sensed spatial power fluctuations swirling around him. This feeling was very familiar—he knew it was a sign of long-distance teleportation.

The Star Seal served as a pass for entering the Shattered Star Sea because it acted as the anchor for this long-distance teleportation. Without a Star Seal, one could not be transported into the Shattered Star Sea.

The moment he appeared, he looked up.

Everything that entered his sight left him momentarily stunned, and memories instantly surfaced in his eyes.

Because everything he saw was so familiar, he felt as if he had returned to the Hengluo Star Domain.

Back in the Hengluo Star Domain, Yang Kai had traveled to many Cultivation Stars, journeying through the vastness of the Star Domain time and again. Scenes like the one before him now were a common sight along his wanderings.

The only difference was that the scene before him seemed even more desolate and lifeless than any place he had seen in the Hengluo Star Domain. Everywhere he looked, there was nothing but shattered ruins. Yang Kai even spotted a broken Cultivation Star in the distance.

That Cultivation Star was at least a month’s journey from his current position, no smaller than his own Dark Star, but its left half had been blasted apart by some unknown, violent force, leaving only half remaining.

There were quite a few other shattered stars like this all around.

Yang Kai’s heart trembled violently!

He had no idea what kind of power it would take to accomplish such a thing. But whoever did it was definitely a Great Emperor-level expert.

Back then, when the Great Emperors besieged the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor, could this battlefield have been in some Star Domain? The thought suddenly popped into Yang Kai’s mind. Otherwise, why would the Shattered Star Sea have so many ruined Cultivation Stars?

If that was the case, then that battle must have been a catastrophe for this Star Domain. Perhaps it was precisely because of that battle that this Star Domain became so desolate, swallowed by spatial cracks, only able to open at special times.

At this thought, Yang Kai’s expression grew somber. He could hardly imagine what would have happened if that ancient battle had taken place in the Hengluo Star Domain. If that were truly the case, then the scene before his eyes was the future that awaited the Hengluo Star Domain—no more Tongxuan Continent, no more Shuiyue Star, no more Dark Star. There would be nothing left but shattered stars and a ruined battlefield, forever stripped of vitality, never to recover.

As he was lost in thought, a strange fluctuation of power suddenly came from not far behind him.

Yang Kai turned to look and saw someone suddenly appear about a hundred zhang away, also looking around in confusion just as he had.

When he saw the person’s face clearly, Yang Kai grinned: “Young Sect Master, fate really brings us together!”

Perhaps because they had stood together on the arena when the Shattered Star Sea opened, Feng Xi had appeared nearby, while the other rising stars of the Northern Territory were nowhere to be seen—who knew where they had been sent.

Earlier, his attack had failed because of the Star Seal’s anomaly. Now, seeing Feng Xi again, Yang Kai was naturally delighted.

As he spoke, Yang Kai leapt toward Feng Xi.

This was the Shattered Star Sea—no crowd of onlookers, no Feng Xuan or Yao Zhuo. Even if he killed Feng Xi here, no one would know, and there was no need to worry about sparking a war between Ice Heart Valley and Wenqing Sect.

With such a golden opportunity, how could Yang Kai let it slip by? So, this time, he attacked with full force, intent on killing Feng Xi in a single blow.

Feng Xi also snapped back to his senses. Seeing Yang Kai charging at him with overwhelming momentum, he showed no panic or intent to dodge or defend. Instead, he stood his ground, coldly watching Yang Kai and sneered, “There’s a road to heaven, but you refuse to walk it. There’s no door to hell, yet you insist on barging in. Go die.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he raised his hand and hurled a bead with all his might.

A terrifying power instantly spread out, thick Imperial Might sweeping in all directions, shaking even the Starry Sky.

“Emperor Extinction Pill!” Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically, and he cried out in shock.

Although Bing Yun had warned him before, and he had always been on guard against Feng Xi’s trump card, until Feng Xi actually used the Emperor Extinction Pill, Yang Kai couldn’t be sure he had it.

But now, the truth was right before his eyes, leaving Yang Kai no room for doubt.

Feng Xi really did have an Emperor Extinction Pill! Maybe he’d been frightened by Yang Kai on the arena earlier, so this time, upon meeting again, he used it without hesitation.

The Emperor Extinction Pill, refined by a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert—how could Yang Kai dare to take it head-on? Realizing the danger, he immediately turned and, under the surge of Spatial Law, retreated several hundred zhang in a flash.

Boom…

A soul-shaking tremor swept over. In the empty void, Feng Xuan’s phantom suddenly appeared, enormous and unmatched, head touching the sky, feet planted on the earth, gazing emptily at Yang Kai. Then, he slowly pointed a finger at him.

A low chant echoed for a hundred li around: “Wenqing Finger!”

As soon as the chant faded, Yang Kai felt a breath of death chasing after him from behind.

In great alarm, he roared, “Dragon Transformation!”

In an instant, dragon scales covered his entire body, his hands turned into dragon claws, and he also activated the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi, gathering it on his back for protection.

“Since an ant is doomed to die, why bother struggling? Hahahaha!” Feng Xi stood proudly in the void, watching Yang Kai flee in disarray, unable to restrain his triumphant laughter.

Even though he had used an Emperor Extinction Pill and lost a trump card, nearly draining all his Origin Qi, as long as he could kill Yang Kai, it was all worth it.

Yang Kai had dared to compete with him for a woman and had humiliated him on the arena in Binglun City. He had long hated Yang Kai to the bone and was determined to kill him. He never expected to run into this guy as soon as he entered the Shattered Star Sea—this was simply a gift from the heavens, and Feng Xi would not let it slip by.

He didn’t believe that a mere Third Stage Dao Origin Realm like Yang Kai could survive his father’s Emperor Extinction Pill.

Yang Kai had just activated Dragon Transformation and the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi, when a tremendous force struck his back. His mind went blank, his back felt as if it were being torn apart, the pain unbearable. His bones all cracked, and a sweet taste rose in his throat—he spat out a mouthful of blood.

He had no time to check his injuries and immediately used spatial power to teleport forward again.

Life and death hung by a thread. The Emperor Extinction Pill’s power hadn’t even fully erupted, yet it was already putting him under such pressure. If it all exploded at once, Yang Kai figured that even with his mastery of spatial force, he’d have no hope of escape.

The thick Imperial Might pressed in from behind, sealing off the space all around. Yang Kai knew that if he got caught in it, even wings wouldn’t let him fly free.

Rumble…

The violent, continuous roar from behind kept reaching his ears. The power of that one finger from the Emperor Extinction Pill still clung to him like a shadow. Yang Kai bit through his tongue, burning his own Essence-Blood in desperation, and his speed increased dramatically—he shot forward several thousand zhang in the blink of an eye.

Another muffled boom rang out. Only now did the Emperor Extinction Pill’s power seem to fully erupt.

In the direction Yang Kai was fleeing, a massive black hole suddenly appeared. Within it was utter nothingness and chaos, making one’s heart tremble with unease.

Feng Xuan’s phantom still stood in the void, gazing into the distance where Yang Kai had fled. After a long while, the phantom gradually faded away.

“Hahahaha, now there’s not even a scrap left of him! You’re still too green to fight me!” Feng Xi thought Yang Kai was surely dead and couldn’t help but laugh loudly. The laughter triggered his own weakness, and he broke into a fit of violent coughing.

Only after finally steadying himself did Feng Xi glare hatefully in the direction of the black hole, then turn and speed off in another direction.

Having used the Emperor Extinction Pill, his Origin Qi was nearly drained. He had to quickly find a place to recover, or he’d be powerless to defend himself if he ran into danger here.

The Shattered Star Sea was no safe place. In this hellish land, anyone searching for the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s legacy was an enemy—upon meeting, they could fight to the death without a word.

On the other side, the supposedly doomed Yang Kai, dragging his heavily wounded body, finally managed to rush into the Meteorite Sea. By now, his vision was blurry, and he felt he could pass out at any moment.

Since he began cultivating, he felt he had never suffered such a grievous injury.
