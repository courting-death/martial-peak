## Chapter 2169 — Take One First

"This is..." Lan Xun's gaze fell upon the fourth treasure. That thing looked somewhat like a Spiritual Pill, yet not quite, appearing extremely peculiar.

Lan Xun's delicate brows furrowed slightly, as if a bit confused, but soon her expression brightened and she exclaimed, "Emperor Severing Pill!"

"What?" Luo Yuan, who had not spoken until now, suddenly cried out in shock, "Emperor Severing Pill? Are you sure you didn't see wrong?"

At these words, Xiao Chen couldn't help but snort coldly, "Mind your words, you stand before Her Highness the Princess!"

Luo Yuan turned to glance at him, their eyes meeting, sparks flying.

Lan Xun covered her mouth with a smile and said, "This should indeed be the Emperor Severing Pill. Brother Luo, if you don't believe it, once we break the restriction and take it out, you'll see for yourself."

"It's not that I don't believe!" Luo Yuan snorted. "It's just... I never expected such a treasure would actually appear here."

Lan Xun nodded, "I didn't expect it either. The Emperor Severing Pill... I've never seen one, only heard my father mention it a few times, so I didn't recognize it at first. But... each Emperor Severing Pill contains the full-force strike of an Emperor Realm expert. If one could obtain this, it would be no less than having a trump card!"

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood the mystery behind the Emperor Severing Pill and the depths of its power.

This item actually sealed the full-force strike of an Emperor Realm expert! Its marvel was somewhat similar to the Star Emperor Token he had obtained back in his home Star Domain.

Within the Star Emperor Token, too, was sealed a divine ability of the Starry Sky Emperor!

Among everyone present, all were Dao Origin Realm cultivators. If one could possess this Emperor Severing Pill, who at the same level could be an opponent? Even when facing an Emperor, one might still have a chance to fight!

Just as Lan Xun said, this thing could indeed serve as a trump card, and a decisive one at that!

In a cultivator's trials, who hasn't faced life-and-death moments? At such critical times, the Emperor Severing Pill is undoubtedly the best ace in the hole.

Everyone's breathing grew rapid again, faces flushed with excitement...

"As for the last item..." Lan Xun's delicate brows drew together once more. She studied the fire-red bead, about the size of a longan, for a long while before slowly shaking her head. "Forgive my ignorance—I do not recognize it. Do any of you have an inkling of what it might be?"

Even someone like Lan Xun didn't recognize the fiery red bead, so naturally, no one else did either. They all shook their heads, indicating they had never seen such a thing.

Lan Xun smiled faintly and said, "No matter what it is, since it's placed here with the other items, it must be extraordinary as well."

Her words were not without reason.

Among the five items upon the high platform—a defensive pseudo–Imperial Treasure, a drop of Taiyi Divine Water, a wisp of Imperial Aura, and an Emperor Severing Pill—each is a peerless treasure worth a city, and each is nearly extinct in this world. Speaking strictly of value, it’s impossible to say which is higher or lower; there’s no reason the fifth item would be useless. That fiery red bead is at the very least on the same level as the others—only no one knows what it actually does.

"Actually..." Lan Xun's beautiful eyes grew misty as her gaze fixed on the center of the high platform, where an empty light barrier remained, nothing inside. "I'm more curious about what was originally here."

"What does Your Highness mean by that?" Kong Qi asked.

Lan Xun said, "Within this restriction, there remains a very strong trace of Imperial Might. If I'm not mistaken, there should have originally been an Imperial Treasure here..."

"Imperial Treasure?"

"Really?"

"Impossible!"

Even those present who had seen great storms were shocked. Imperial Treasures are not things one can obtain easily, so they couldn't help but cry out in surprise.

"There's no mistake..." Lan Xun said firmly. "And just not long ago, this Imperial Treasure was still here. I just don't know why it suddenly disappeared. Otherwise, the lingering Imperial Might wouldn't be so clear."

"Did someone come here before us?" Gong Wenshan's face darkened.

"Damn it, who got here first!" Kong Qi also cursed angrily.

Lan Xun shook her head, "That shouldn't be it. If someone really did get here before us, why would they only take one treasure? The rest are all rare treasures too—there's no reason to leave them behind. Besides, the restriction isn't damaged..."

"Then what's going on?" Kong Qi was completely confused.

"I don't know either." Lan Xun smiled helplessly.

As they spoke, an image of the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress flashed involuntarily through Yang Kai's mind...

Recalling the Imperial Might radiating from Zhang Ruoxi when she wore the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress, and then sensing the lingering aura on the high platform... Yang Kai immediately coughed dryly and said, "Whether or not there was once an Imperial Treasure here, since it's gone now, it means we have no fate with it. Let's talk about how to divide the remaining items."

As soon as he said this, the previously harmonious atmosphere instantly became tense. Everyone quietly circulated their Origin Qi, subtly widening the distance between themselves and the others, their gazes wary and grave.

There were five treasures, but eight people. Clearly, they couldn't be divided evenly—some would end up with nothing.

All were proud sons of heaven, all powerful figures. No one was willing to leave empty-handed.

"Everyone, I have a suggestion. Would you care to hear it?" Xiao Chen suddenly said with a smile.

Kong Qi didn't know what trick he was up to, but since he had spoken, it wouldn't be polite to interrupt, so he said, "Brother Xiao, what good idea do you have? Let's hear it!"

The others also turned their attention to him.

Seeing this, Xiao Chen laughed heartily and said, "In the Southern Territory, my Star God Palace is supreme. Just now, Her Highness the Princess generously shared much information with everyone. Her Highness is righteous and selfless—shouldn't we show our appreciation?"

At this, everyone suddenly had a bad feeling.

Sure enough, Xiao Chen continued, "I think, given Her Highness's status, she should take one item first. What do you all think?"

In their hearts, everyone cursed Xiao Chen out thoroughly! But in front of Lan Xun, they couldn't vent their anger, so they all wore gloomy faces and said nothing.

Originally, there weren’t enough treasures to divide as it was, yet this fellow even proposed letting Lan Xun take one first—pure banditry, utterly shameless. Had anyone else spoken such words, they would have been drowned in spit; but with Xiao Chen invoking Lan Xun’s name, none dared act presumptuous.

With Lan Xun's status, who would dare object? Who would dare offend her and still hope to get by in the Southern Territory?

Even someone as forceful as Luo Yuan was gloomy and silent at this moment.

He might not back down from Wuchang, but he knew there were some people in this world you simply couldn't offend—Lan Xun was one of them...

"What? You all think my suggestion is inappropriate?" Xiao Chen, waving the Star God Palace's banner, saw everyone silent and snorted coldly, "Or do you all look down on my Star God Palace?"

With this big hat thrown down, Kong Qi immediately shot Xiao Chen a look as if he'd sullied his mother, cursing him out in his heart...

"This..." Murong Xiaoxiao, kind-hearted, saw how awkward things had become and, after saying a word, didn't know how to ease the tension, her face flushed red.

The others all remained silent, not expressing any opinion.

Observing the situation, Yang Kai saw Lan Xun's brows furrow slightly, as if a bit displeased, and knew this was not something she and Xiao Chen had discussed, but rather his own decision. He nodded to himself in secret.

He still had a good impression of Lan Xun. If she really wanted to use the Emperor and Star God Palace's prestige to seize a treasure, no one would be able to stop her, but her image would suffer greatly.

Besides, though the items on the high platform were all extremely precious, with Lan Xun's status, she might not even care for them.

That pitch-black shield was utterly useless to her, since she already had a defensive Imperial Treasure bestowed by the Emperor.

Taiyi Divine Water was also of no use to her. The Star God Palace had countless Spiritual Herbs and wondrous medicines of all ages—why would she need Taiyi Divine Water to hasten their growth?

As for the Imperial Aura, she was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, so it was useless to her as well.

As for the Emperor Severing Pill...

If she truly desired it, she only needed to act a little coy with the Radiant Moon Great Emperor, and he would surely refine a few pills for her. With his boundless cultivation, the loss of a few hundred years of essence was nothing worth fretting over.

Amidst the tense atmosphere, Lan Xun suddenly smiled and said, "Since no one has any objections, then Brother Xiao Chen and I will take one first."

"Hm?" Gong Wenshan raised his brows at her words, as if hearing something between the lines. He looked at Lan Xun in surprise, but soon understood and smiled faintly.

After a brief frown, Kong Qi also caught Lan Xun's meaning and nodded with a smile, "If Your Highness wishes to take one first, I have no objection."

"No objection from me!" Bian Yuqing immediately agreed.

Everyone present was shrewd. Although Lan Xun's words sounded similar to Xiao Chen's, the intent was completely different—how could they not hear it?

"And you all?" Lan Xun turned to look at Luo Yuan and the others.

"Your Highness may do as you please. I may not trust others, but I trust you."

Lan Xun nodded gently, "Thank you, Brother Luo, for giving me this honor."

With Luo Yuan's stance clear, how could Yang Kai and Murong Xiaoxiao have any objections?

As everyone nodded in agreement, Xiao Chen grew anxious, his eyes reddening, "Your Highness..."

The smile vanished from Lan Xun's face as she looked at him coldly, "Brother Xiao Chen, since everyone has no objections, please go and fetch what belongs to us..."

As she spoke, her beautiful eyes flickered, she looked at the high platform, pointed, and said, "Bring back the pseudo-Imperial Treasure!"

Of the five treasures, it's truly hard to judge their value. Each person's needs are different, so the use of these five items varies as well...

But for Lan Xun, the least valuable among them was undoubtedly that shield pseudo-Imperial Treasure.

To her, it was completely useless! Even that mysterious fiery red bead, whose use was unknown, might be a wondrous item and of some use to her.

Yet she still chose the pseudo-Imperial Treasure!
