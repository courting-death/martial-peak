## Chapter 105 — The Mystery Hidden Within the Pill

After the few had reached an agreement and were about to act, Junior Brother Ye suddenly looked at Yuan Lang and asked, “Senior Brother Yuan, when Yang Kai fled just now, it seemed he dropped something. Do you know what it is?”

Yuan Lang was momentarily taken aback, then chuckled softly. “Junior Brother Ye, your observation is indeed keen.”

As he spoke, he opened his palm to reveal a small vial. “It should be a bottle of pills.”

“May I take a look?” Junior Brother Ye smiled faintly. Both Yang Kai and that woman possessed high-grade secret treasures of considerable value. When this vial fell out earlier, Yang Kai had clearly shown reluctance to part with it. A pill worthy of such attachment must not be of low value.

For this very reason, Junior Brother Ye was unwilling to let Yuan Lang monopolize the spoils. Having all participated in the battle, it was only fair that all share in the gains.

“Of course!” Yuan Lang understood Junior Brother Ye’s intentions and had no desire to hoard the prize. He uncorked the vial and peered inside, immediately voicing his surprise.

“It appears to be a Yang-attribute pill!” Yuan Lang’s face brightened with delight.

Junior Brother Ye and Junior Brother Wu also grew excited. “Really?”

“You’ll see for yourselves.” Yuan Lang said as he poured some pills out and flicked them to the two junior brothers.

“Indeed, these are Yang-attribute pills!” Junior Brother Wu’s expression was one of great joy. The moment the few pills touched his hand, he felt the chill around him dissipate significantly. He no longer needed to expend Primordial Qi to resist the invading Yin energy. These pills were truly the bane of the valley’s pervasive Yin aura.

No wonder Yang Kai was so reluctant to part with them. In such a hostile environment, these Yang-attribute pills were the most precious resource. Losing this support would only worsen his plight.

Yuan Lang shook the vial. “The pills have been divided. However, Junior Brothers, these pills may conceal hidden secrets. Do not consume them; merely carry them to dispel the cold. I will take my leave first.”

After all, these pills had been left behind by Yang Kai. What if they were poisoned? Though none of them were as meticulous as Senior Brother Cai, they were not foolish enough to ingest the enemy’s provisions.

With that, Yuan Lang vanished with a swift movement.

The other two also tucked the pills into their robes and pursued the direction in which Yang Kai had disappeared.

Like a wounded beast licking its wounds, Yang Kai silently concealed himself atop a tree canopy, exerting all his effort to suppress his aura. His eyes vigilantly scanned the surroundings.

His condition was poor. After a fierce battle with five disciples from Fengyu Tower, he had already sustained injuries. The subsequent ambush by four members of the Blood Battle Gang had worsened his wounds considerably.

The sword that pierced his shoulder had undoubtedly damaged tendons and bones, leaving his left hand weak and difficult to move.

To prevent his pursuers from tracking him by his blood trail, Yang Kai had used Yang Liquid to cauterize all his wounds, sealing the bleeding.

Though his Unyielding Will allowed him to maintain peak strength, he was ultimately still a Fourth Stage Open Origin Realm cultivator. After consecutive battles, his physical and mental reserves were severely depleted. Were it not for his indomitable will, he would have collapsed long ago.

Recalling the perilous fight just now, Yang Kai could not help but sneer inwardly.

Senior Brother Cai was truly a master of the Separation and Union Realm. Though most of his cultivation had been sealed, it still took ten drops of Yang Liquid to break through the Primordial Qi seal within Yang Kai’s body and land a fatal blow.

But it was worth it! Though refining ten drops of Yang Liquid was arduous, exchanging them for the life of a Separation and Union Realm expert was no waste.

In this dire situation, Yang Kai’s mind was clearer than ever. He understood that failure would cost him his life and implicate Xia Ningshang as well.

With such high stakes, how could Yang Kai afford the slightest negligence?

Besides Long Hui and the strongest member, three others remained in the Blood Battle Gang. Their strength was inferior to Senior Brother Cai’s. One-on-one, Yang Kai was unafraid, but if they united, the situation would be difficult.

To know oneself and the enemy is to win every battle! Yang Kai had to discern the movements and attack directions of these three to devise a counter-strategy.

Hence, before leaving, he had deliberately left behind a bottle of pills. The primary purpose of the recent battle was to conceal the trace of this pill’s abandonment, with the secondary goal of eliminating Senior Brother Cai. Fortunately, both objectives had been achieved.

The pill left behind was the Azure Blood Mysterious Yang Pill. A few days prior, Yang Kai had found over ten Azure Blood Mysterious Yang Flowers, and Xia Ningshang had helped him refine them.

Because his Dantian still held ample Yang Liquid and he was hurrying along, Yang Kai had not consumed them then. Unexpectedly, they now came into play.

Sometimes, pills do not need to be ingested to cause effects. Yang Kai intended to warn them that even carrying his pills could be problematic.

He trusted his plan would succeed. This was a place where the Nine Yin converged, thick with Yin energy. Suddenly possessing a Yang-attribute pill, it was obvious what those men would do.

As long as they carried the Azure Blood Mysterious Yang Pill, Yang Kai could use the Yang Source Seal to track their locations, thus seizing the initiative.

After a brief moment of concealment, the Yang Source Seal on his chest indeed reacted. Yang Kai’s expression tightened as he held his breath, suppressing his heartbeat.

Soon, one person dashed past below. Yang Kai frowned.

Why only one?

After a short wait, another hurried by nearby.

A moment later, a third appeared beneath the tree where Yang Kai was hidden. Peering down, he recognized this person as the weakest disciple of the Blood Battle Gang.

This man scanned the surroundings briefly before disappearing swiftly.

Strange—why were these three separated? Yang Kai frowned in deep thought but could not fathom the reason.

Little did he know, these three believed him to be at his last gasp, and with powerful Earth-Grade secret treasures in hand, they separated to see who might be lucky enough to find him.

It was no wonder they thought so. An ordinary Open Origin Realm cultivator would not have much Primordial Qi left after several life-or-death battles. But Yang Kai was different; his meridians might be depleted, but his Dantian reserve of Yang Liquid was abundant.

Before setting out, Yang Kai’s Dantian had stored over forty drops of Yang Liquid. Even if his meridian Primordial Qi was exhausted, a single drop of Yang Liquid could fully replenish it, restoring his vigor.

In short, as long as his Dantian reserves remained and his body and mind could keep pace, Yang Kai was an indefatigable fighting machine.

Had Senior Brother Cai survived, with his usual caution, he would never have allowed his men to separate and give Yang Kai a chance to pick them off one by one. But Yang Kai had risked everything to kill him. Now Yuan Lang was in command, and profit was paramount; he naturally did not consider such subtleties.

Though Yang Kai could not grasp the deeper meaning, the situation was unfolding even more favorably than he had hoped. How could he not seize this opportunity?
