## Chapter 527 — Waiting a Little Longer Does No Harm

Seeing Ling Taixu in such a posture, the expressions of the Eight Great Families’ cultivators relaxed somewhat. The stout elder chuckled, “Brother Ling, you are too modest. Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm there is no hierarchy of seniority; everyone interacts as equals. In truth, even among the eight of us, our ranks are all rather mixed up.”

“That’s right, that’s right.”

Someone chimed in in agreement.

After a few polite exchanges, the atmosphere suddenly eased considerably.

“Brother Ling, what brings you here this time?” Yang Liting still wore a cold expression, asking knowingly.

“Naturally, it is about this young man.” Ling Taixu smiled faintly, pointing at Yang Kai’s location. “After all, I am his grandmaster; at this critical moment of his Ascension to the Divine Roaming Realm, I must take good care of him.”

“You want to protect him as well?”

“Correct.” Ling Taixu gave a slight nod.

Yang Liting immediately felt somewhat troubled.

Ling Taixu, whose power surpassed even the Divine Roaming Realm, the mysteriously enigmatic Meng Wuya, Di Mo covered in demonic aura, and the eight Blood Servants wielding the Blood Fury Technique… the combined strength of these figures was no longer something he could ignore.

Once the Blood Servants reached the ninth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm and employed the Blood Fury Technique, they could hold their own against those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm—eight such Blood Servants was a force not to be underestimated.

Ling Taixu’s prowess was well known. Yang Liting doubted he could match him one-on-one. Meng Wuya was even more inscrutable—Yang Liting did not know how to gauge his combat strength. Di Mo watched intently from the sidelines.

This confrontation… was not to be started. Even if they could win, the resulting slaughter in War City would be catastrophic.

Yang Liting’s sharp hawk-like eyes finally trembled slightly. Piercing through the endless darkness, they fixed upon Yang Kai.

He did not understand how this junior from his own clan had managed to gather such formidable champions to speak and negotiate on his behalf.

“Gentlemen, may I say a word?” Ling Taixu’s expression turned solemn.

“Please, Brother Ling,” Qiu Daoren nodded respectfully. Facing Ling Taixu, also beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, none of them cared too much for authority or rank anymore.

Ling Taixu was entitled to speak on equal terms.

“You all wish to prevent my disciple from ascending to the Divine Roaming Realm out of fear that his character will change with newfound strength, that he will fall into evil, becoming neither man nor ghost and wreaking havoc.”

Several nodded in acknowledgment of Ling Taixu’s point.

Yet Di Mo rolled his eyes and muttered with displeasure, “The real evil is those who cannot control their strength, who are enslaved by their own power. Cultivating demonic techniques means nothing; nor does being filled with demonic aura. It’s simply that we all pursue strength differently. Since our paths diverge, why deny and suppress one another? A bunch of shortsighted fools.”

“Speak louder,” Shui Ling, who had somehow slipped to Di Mo’s side, encouraged eagerly. “If you say it that quietly, they can’t hear you.”

Di Mo gave her a sharp glare and chuckled, “You little girl, don’t try to fool me. Don’t think I don’t know your background!”

Shui Ling was startled. “You know?”

“Hmph, of course I know. Not only do I know, that old bastard Meng Wuya up there knows as well. We all come from the same sky,” Di Mo said with a proud sneer.

Shui Ling’s eyes instantly lit up. Grabbing Di Mo’s arm, she wore a look of finding a soulmate. Tears glistening in her eyes, she asked earnestly, “Senior, do you know how to go back?”

Di Mo sized her up and chuckled deeply, “What’s this? You can’t return?”

“Yes, I’ve been trapped here for so long, not knowing how to get back. If you know, could you please tell me?”

Di Mo let out a harsh laugh that made Shui Ling feel as if cats were clawing her inside. She felt miserable but forced herself to look pitiful, begging for sympathy.

“I won’t tell you!” Di Mo suddenly waved his hand dismissively.

Shui Ling was stunned, pouting in disappointment, “Why not?”

Di Mo shrugged, “Because I’m waiting for the Young Master.”

“Waiting for him?” Shui Ling was taken aback. “Do you think he can break the bonds of this world?”

Di Mo snorted, “If the Young Master can’t, then no one can.”

Shui Ling’s expression grew serious. She looked towards Yang Kai and nodded softly after a moment. “If it’s this man, then it’s quite possible…”

“Just wait and see. At most ten years, maybe three to five years, the Young Master will surely reach that level.” Di Mo’s confidence was overflowing; his expectations for Yang Kai’s future boundless.

Shui Ling’s face turned dark. Her legs felt weak. “So long?”

“If you want to return too, you can wait. But whether the Young Master brings you along is not up to me. After all, you two had some unpleasant conflicts before. The Young Master is… very grudging,” Di Mo said, glancing sideways at Shui Ling as he shook his head slowly.

Shui Ling thought it over carefully. Considering the man’s brutal disposition and cold demeanor, he likely would not take her willingly. She hurriedly pleaded with utmost reverence, “Please, Senior, guide me out of this confusion!”

Di Mo laughed loudly. “Alright, alright.”

After a pause, he spoke in a low voice, “The Young Master, though grudging and ruthless, is loyal to his friends. Having been in War City for so long, you must have seen his nature by now.”

Shui Ling nodded slightly, her eyes becoming somewhat distant.

This current incident was nearly a perfect example. Although Shui Ling did not know the full details, she had a rough idea.

For the sake of a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai would make such a big move, even returning the Soul Binding Curse to her and asking for her help in capturing Xiang Chu. This showed that he was a man of true character—merciless and bloody to enemies, generous and straightforward to friends, with an extreme personality.

“You’ve noticed this; don’t you know what to do now?” Di Mo looked at her meaningfully.

Shui Ling’s heart stirred with sudden clarity. She nodded: “I understand. I need to make him see me as a friend.”

If she could befriend him, how could he not take her with him when he leaves?

“Heh heh…” Di Mo gave a strange laugh. “The Young Master has never turned down any woman, especially a beautiful one. You should be fine. With your background, you and the Young Master are quite a match. Work hard!”

Shui Ling blushed and shot Di Mo a glare. “What nonsense! A scoundrel like him doesn’t deserve me!”

Di Mo sneered, “In ten years, you won’t say that anymore.”

Shui Ling was stunned. She felt Di Mo was overly optimistic about Yang Kai and chose not to argue further. Instead, she resolved firmly to maintain a good relationship with Yang Kai.

While the two spoke, the others beyond the Divine Roaming Realm continued their deliberations.

Ling Taixu said, “I believe that even if my disciple ascends, his character will not be influenced.”

“On what basis do you judge this?” Yang Liting snorted coldly.

“Because he grew up right under my watch. I know him better than you.” Ling Taixu smiled faintly. Unlike others, he had seen the side of Yang Kai filled with corruption, had discussed it with him, and naturally placed great trust in him.

“That is reasonable.” Qiu Daoren nodded lightly, stroking his beard, thinking deeply before saying, “But what if things develop just as we fear?”

“Then there will be no need for you to intervene. I will clean house myself!” Ling Taixu’s face grew stern as he declared loudly, before his expression darkened somewhat. “My sect has already suffered one such incident before. There can be no second time!”

The Eight Great Families’ cultivators furrowed their brows. They knew Ling Taixu was undoubtedly referring to the Evil Lord and could somewhat understand his feelings.

“You all can’t wait even this little while?” Ling Taixu looked at them.

“Fine!” Yang Liting nodded heavily. “We will follow your plan. After he ascends, if his character truly changes greatly, Brother Ling, you will handle it.”

“Rest assured. If that happens, I will strip him of his cultivation.”

“I never intended to kill him!” Yang Liting snorted lightly, falling silent along with the other seven, quietly waiting. Even if Yang Kai’s character shifted drastically after ascension, he would be no more than a Divine Roaming Realm cultivator; with so many powerful experts here, how could he escape?

So waiting a little longer was no problem.

Ling Taixu shook his head slightly but showed no sign of anxiety. It was clear he had complete confidence in Yang Kai and worried not for any accident.

With this agreement reached, the Blood Servants who had been blocking the Eight Great Families, as well as Dong Qinghan and his group, all exhaled unconsciously. Once the breath was released, they realized their bodies were drenched in cold sweat, chilled to the bone by the passing wind.

To confront those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm was something they would never have dared to imagine before. Yet today, they had done so without hesitation.

Ling Taixu and Meng Wuya nodded slightly at them, prompting the group to react with excitement…

Qiu Daoren released Qiu Yimeng, who had long been restrained, and the foremost expert of the Huo Family freed Huo Xingchen. Both quickly returned to their own factions, coordinating and arranging for everyone to retreat some distance.

The warriors of the Yang Zhao Estate also instinctively withdrew for safety.

After a while, Yang Kai was left surrounded only by Ling Taixu, Meng Wuya, and the Eight Great Families’ eight experts.

Previously, the others were engaged in negotiation or spectating, paying little attention to Yang Kai. Now, all gazes fixed on him, recognizing the terrifying baptism of Heavenly Energies he was enduring.

Massive energies bombarded Yang Kai from the turbulent clouds above incessantly. These energies would overwhelm any top-tier Divine Roaming Realm expert. Yet Yang Kai floated quietly below the clouds, his body generating a fierce suction like a bottomless pit, absorbing all the energies without waste.

No hardship, no strain; his body dealt with it effortlessly.
