## Chapter 200 — Night Raid on the Miao Family

In recent months, Miao Huacheng felt that he was particularly lucky, reaping tremendous rewards.

First, the widow of the Jiang family brought a large batch of valuable items to seek refuge with him, causing the Miao family's wealth to double overnight. Later, he contributed that mysterious turtle shell to the Yunxia Sect, and an elder from Yunxia personally promised to nurture his son, Miao Lin, in the future, even bestowing upon him some medicinal pills for cultivation.

With his son receiving such attention, Miao Huacheng felt genuine comfort and joy. Even in matters as significant as exploring the Hidden Island, Yunxia had brought his son along, showcasing their sincerity.

Miao Lin had once told him that he intended to take a girl named Yu Aoqing as his wife. If his son succeeded, Miao Huacheng believed he would also rise in status. He had investigated thoroughly and learned that Yu Aoqing was the only daughter of an elder from Yunxia. If his son could win her over, the future of the Miao family would surely be bright.

The only regret he had was that the Jiang family’s lady had resisted too fiercely that day, preventing him from taking advantage of the situation. Remembering the lady's voluptuous and fair body, her dignified yet alluring appearance, Miao Huacheng felt a pang of annoyance. If he hadn’t been so furious at the time, he would never have sold her to the Thousand Gold Brothel; he should have kept her to train until she became obedient and submissive, turning into his plaything.

Women, once in bed, could be toyed with however one wished. If he made her feel good, she would surely forget her troubles.

Later, when Miao Huacheng went to the Thousand Gold Brothel for some fun, he heard from the madam that the lady had even scratched her face. Fierce and loyal, she could no longer take clients, and was reluctantly sold to the Yunxia Sect.

Hmph, falling into the hands of the Yunxia Sect, what good could come of it? Miao Huacheng sneered; she had brought this upon herself.

Taking a sip of strong liquor, Miao Huacheng laughed heartily, one arm around a beautiful maid, feeling quite pleased with himself.

On either side of him were two beautiful maids, both recently redeemed from the Thousand Gold Brothel, exquisite and captivating. Miao Huacheng had spent the past few days indulging with them in bed.

At this moment, the three of them sat on the bed, where a small table held several exquisite dishes. Miao Huacheng wore a nightgown, while the two maids were nearly naked, wearing only form-fitting garments, their beautiful figures mostly exposed, with slender waists, long legs, and ample bosoms, a sight to behold.

As they drank and enjoyed themselves, Miao Huacheng occasionally groped the maid beside him, his gaze growing more and more hazy, his interest rising.

“Clear the table, I’ll teach you two a new trick!” Miao Huacheng waved his hand drunkenly.

The two maids giggled as they stood up to remove the table and food.

“Hehe, come here!” Miao Huacheng leered, beckoning them over. As they approached the bed, he suddenly pulled them into his embrace.

In a matter of moments, the maids’ garments were stripped away.

Miao Huacheng laid them side by side on the bed, removing his own clothes. Just as he was about to act on one of the maidens, a sudden, piercing scream rang out from outside.

The scream sent a chill down Miao Huacheng’s spine, and he jumped to his feet in an instant.

He heard an angry shout from outside: “Which brat dares to cause trouble at the Miao family!”

As soon as the words were spoken, there was a loud thud. The guards sprang into action, roaring in anger, clearly already engaged in a fight. Miao Huacheng didn’t rush out but listened intently, and after a moment, his expression changed. He realized that the intruder was incredibly strong, as his hired guards were being killed one after another.

Yang Kai, dressed in black, walked through the Miao family’s main gate, wielding a steel knife he had casually picked up. The glint of the blade promised death!

These martial artists from a small family were no match for disciples from sects. Many of the guards he had hired were those who had no future in martial arts, having given up on their cultivation to serve these families for a living.

The Miao family was not a large household; how strong could those who were recruited be?

Yang Kai had already gathered all the information about the Miao family days ago. The strongest among them was Miao Huacheng, who had only reached the peak of the Separation and Union Realm. There were a few other guards at the Separation and Union Realm, but most were merely at the Qi Movement Realm.

These individuals were mediocre in talent, having cultivated for twenty or thirty years or more, yet only reaching this level, serving as guards for Miao Huacheng, aiding him in his misdeeds.

As soon as Yang Kai broke in, he was noticed by these guards. After a brief exchange, several of them had already perished.

With his strength at the ninth layer of the Qi Movement Realm, he was far superior to many of the Miao family’s guards. Moreover, Yang Kai was filled with rage, his Yuan Qi surging violently, exuding a menacing aura, appearing almost demonic, with his crimson eyes flashing with a savage light.

This aura instilled fear in the hearts of the Miao family’s guards.

To deal with the Yunxia Sect, Yang Kai had to rely on the power of Gu Yun Island. But to handle the Miao family, he had to take matters into his own hands. Only by personally resolving the enmity could it be considered truly settled.

“Kid, who exactly are you? To possess such strength at such a young age, which island’s disciple are you?” asked one of the Miao family’s guards at the Separation and Union Realm, frowning.

At such a young age to reach the peak of the Qi Movement Realm, only disciples from overseas islands could achieve this; the families in Haicheng could not cultivate such talent. Thus, this guard was genuinely apprehensive; any overseas force was not something the Miao family could provoke.

If they killed this young man and attracted unwanted trouble, it would be disastrous. Although he had taken Miao Huacheng’s silver and worked for the Miao family, he did not want to bring disaster upon himself.

But this kid was quite strange; since he entered, he hadn’t said a word, only killing, which was infuriating. There’s a reason for every grievance; even if you come to the Miao family to kill, there should be a reason, right?

“Young man, which sect are you from? Can you tell us?” the guard cautiously inquired again.

Yang Kai’s expression was indifferent as he held the dripping steel knife, stepping forward.

Damn it! Yang Kai’s attitude completely enraged the Miao family’s guards. The first guard who had spoken roared, “Kill him!”

“What if he’s a disciple from some island?” someone else said nervously.

“This kid is filled with evil energy, ignoring our questions; he must be insane. What kind of evil martial artist would come from those islands?” 

This reasoning made sense. Since Yang Kai entered, he hadn’t said a word or answered their questions, only killing as he walked; wasn’t that madness?

Eradicating evil was everyone’s responsibility!

With this thought, the Miao family’s guards no longer hesitated. Led by several experts at the Separation and Union Realm, they charged forward.

Yang Kai swung his hand, unleashing a wave of black energy, and the steel knife glinted as he struck at a guard at the Qi Movement Realm.

The opponent raised his longsword to block, but unexpectedly, upon contact, the sword shattered, and sparks flew from the steel knife, the scorching True Yang Yuan Qi swirling, not only severing his sword but also splitting his body in half.

Blood rained down, and entrails spilled across the ground.

Two experts at the Separation and Union Realm rushed in from the side, but before they could reach Yang Kai, a strange, eerie laughter echoed in their ears. This soul-chilling sound made their hair stand on end, as if some extraordinary master was lurking nearby.

This moment of hesitation robbed them of the courage to charge at Yang Kai, but Di Mo had already arrived before them, wielding the Soul-Breaking Spike.

In the darkness, Di Mo struck stealthily. Sensing the impending danger, the two experts at the Separation and Union Realm quickly defended themselves, a series of clanging sounds ringing out. Di Mo’s first strike failed, and it immediately retreated.

The Soul-Breaking Spike soon arrived before a guard at the fifth layer of the Qi Movement Realm, piercing through his chest and emerging from his back, seizing his soul.

On the right half of Yunxia Island, Di Mo had devoured much evil energy, and on the Hidden Island, it had consumed the soul power of that thief. At this moment, Di Mo’s combat power was no longer comparable to before; effortlessly killing a guard at the Qi Movement Realm was a piece of cake. Moreover, it was using the Soul-Breaking Spike, driven by its own soul, making it even more difficult to defend against.

As Di Mo wreaked havoc, Yang Kai killed two more guards at the Qi Movement Realm. The remaining Qi Movement Realm martial artists, seeing Yang Kai’s ferocity, dared not approach. Only three experts at the Separation and Union Realm were caught in a dilemma, wary of Yang Kai while also guarding against Di Mo, their palms sweating profusely.

The three exchanged glances, steeling their resolve, and shouted in unison, “Kid, die!”

The three of them attacked simultaneously. Yang Kai raised his steel knife to defend, while Di Mo assisted from the side, unafraid of a two-on-three situation.

With a loud crack, the steel knife shattered. The guard at the Separation and Union Realm who had clashed with Yang Kai staggered back several steps, unable to steady himself. Yang Kai had already flashed in front of him, delivering a fierce punch to his chest.

Bang, bang, bang… three muffled sounds echoed out, and the guard felt a sweet taste in his throat, spitting out a mouthful of blood.

With a single strike, he was severely injured, showcasing the might of the Triple Flame Yang Explosion.

Before the other two could come to his aid, Yang Kai had already withdrawn, and Di Mo swiftly followed up, taking advantage of the turmoil in the guard’s Yuan Qi to pierce through his throat with the Soul-Breaking Spike. After lingering inside for a moment, it flew out again.

“Hahaha! Finally got a decent soul,” Di Mo’s laughter echoed, accompanied by the sound of chewing.

The remaining two experts at the Separation and Union Realm turned pale with fear, still in shock when Yang Kai suddenly reappeared before them, ten zhang away.

His palms were bright red, as if seared by a hot iron, and he struck towards their chests.

The two let out a strange cry, fiercely channeling their Yuan Qi to meet his attack.

Bang, bang… two loud sounds.

Yang Kai’s face paled as he quickly retreated, but the two guards were not faring any better; they felt a burning pain in their palms, and a domineering and fierce torrent of Yuan Qi surged into their bodies.

Not daring to be negligent, they hurriedly defended themselves.

After neutralizing one wave, another wave followed.

Three torrents of Yuan Qi, like crashing waves, surged into their meridians, causing their arms to explode in a mist of blood.

Screams echoed out as Yang Kai retreated, his self-created footwork allowing him to appear and disappear like a ghost, flashing behind the two and delivering fierce punches.

Bang, bang, bang…

The two guards’ bodies were like burlap sacks, caught off guard and taking several punches before they could hurriedly dodge. Yet the True Yang Yuan Qi that had invaded their bodies remained.

Their faces turned crimson as they exerted all their strength to dispel the scorching Yuan Qi.

Di Mo charged once more, seizing the opportunity to strike swiftly, taking the lives of the two guards with extreme efficiency!
