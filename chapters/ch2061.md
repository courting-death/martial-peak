## Chapter 2061 — Night Visit to the Jiang Family

Yang Kai had not had much to do with the Jiang Family, but he had heard of them many times and knew their strength in Fenglin City was not to be scoffed at; it was said an elder at the Dao Origin Realm level presided over the clan.

There were many families in Fenglin City, but few counted a Dao Origin Realm expert among their ranks; the Jiang Family was one, and the Qin Family was another...

Jiang Chuhe, whom he had seen at the Dragon Ascension Altar on the first layer of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, was the outstanding young figure of the Jiang Family’s new generation, possessing the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; with sufficient opportunity he could advance to the Dao Origin Realm.

The Jiang Family had maintained its lineage in Fenglin City for centuries, perhaps even a thousand years; its ties with other great clans and the city lord’s mansion were tangled and complex.

Yang Kai did not know why the Jiang Family had taken Zhang Ruoxi, but a Saint King Realm girl was of little use to the clan; his fear was that some decadent scion of the Jiang Family had taken a fancy to her beauty and intended to do her ill — if that were the case, it would already be too late.

After all, Zhang Ruoxi had been taken by the Jiang Family a month earlier; in a month’s time anything could happen.

What troubled Yang Kai more was why Zhang Ruoxi had willingly left with a few Jiang Family people; then again, the girl was young and had always stayed in the Zhang Family without venturing out — her thoughts were simple, and she could have been deceived.

For a girl like her, a few flattering words could very well make her submit.

Feeling secretly anxious, Yang Kai was also somewhat angry at himself for failing to take proper care of a mere young lass.

Since he meant to go to the Jiang Family to seek Zhang Ruoxi, marching in openly would not do. If he were to touch some nerve of the Jiang Family and drive them to silence Zhang Ruoxi with murder, it would be far too late for regret.

So Yang Kai decided to probe the Jiang Family’s situation first.

If Zhang Ruoxi really was with the Jiang Family, his current powerful Divine Sense should allow him to find her without anyone noticing.

With his mind made up, Yang Kai did not wait for nightfall and headed straight for the Jiang Family’s estate.

In the east of Fenglin City there was a continuous residential area occupying roughly dozens of acres, surrounded by red walls and green tiles, encircled by tall ramparts; anyone who had spent time in Fenglin City knew this was the Jiang Family’s base.

Generally, the Jiang Family’s important members lived here.

Yang Kai came to a stretch of the outer wall, unfurled his Divine Sense, and probed for a moment. To his surprise, the grounds within were woven through with restrictions and traps.

Such restraints, however, were no difficulty for him; now that he had found them, he would of course avoid triggering them.

Just as Yang Kai prepared to climb the wall and slip inside, his expression shifted and he turned, instantly using the Nothingness secret art to conceal himself to one side.

After a moment, a graceful figure suddenly shot over from not far away and landed where Yang Kai had been standing; she looked around, scratched her head, and murmured in a puzzled tone, “He should be right here — where did he go? How strange.”

Hearing the voice, Yang Kai was stunned and glanced that way, then called in surprise, “Xiaoqi?”

The visitor was the mysterious Mo Xiaoqi.

The two had parted in the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda over a year ago and had not met since; Yang Kai had only just returned to Fenglin City, and yet the girl had found him on her own.

Since she was a familiar face, Yang Kai no longer needed to hide; he dispelled the Nothingness art and revealed himself. Mo Xiaoqi at once saw him, giggled, and came over happily, saying, “Eldest Brother Yang, it really is you! I thought I had the wrong person. Where have you been all these months? Why haven’t you been in Fenglin City?”

She fired off a torrent of questions and Yang Kai did not even get a chance to answer.

Yang Kai gave a rueful smile and said, “I had some matters and went out for a while; I only just returned today.”

“Oh.” Mo Xiaoqi nodded and laughed, “I thought Eldest Brother Yang had left without a word — you made me sad for quite some time.”

Yang Kai smiled and said, “If I were really leaving I would have told you; how did you find me?”

Mo Xiaoqi stuck out her pretty tongue and, slightly embarrassed, said, “That sound bead I gave you before… it has a tracking mark on it; as long as the distance isn’t too great I can detect it.”

Yang Kai suddenly understood, took the round bead from his Spatial Ring, examined it, but saw nothing special, and slipped it back.

Mo Xiaoqi looked around and then lowered her voice, asking, “This is the Jiang Family — Eldest Brother Yang, are you going in?”

Yang Kai nodded.

Mo Xiaoqi’s eyes brightened and she quietly asked, “Going in for what? Did the Jiang Family offend you somehow? Do you want me to help?”

She looked excited as if she had found something extremely amusing.

Yang Kai sighed and briefly related Zhang Ruoxi’s matter; Mo Xiaoqi listened and became righteously indignant, saying, “The Jiang Family’s reputation has never been good — for them to lay hands on Sister Ruoxi is outrageous.”

"I’m not sure what the Jiang Family took Ruoxi away for," Yang Kai said with knitted brow, "so I wanted to come and find out quietly."

“I’ll help you! But Eldest Brother Yang, you should have told me you had people in your grotto earlier — if you had told me sooner I would have taken Sister Ruoxi to my place,” Mo Xiaoqi said with a hint of reproach to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai coughed awkwardly and said, “I didn’t know I’d be away so long. Never mind that — I’ll tell you what Ruoxi looks like; be on the lookout when you go in.”

Mo Xiaoqi nodded repeatedly, listened attentively, and memorized Zhang Ruoxi’s features.

A girl of sixteen or seventeen, at the peak of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm — such features were distinct; if Zhang Ruoxi was truly in the Jiang Family, she should be easy to find.

“Be careful; the Jiang Family has an elder at the Dao Origin Realm — don’t get discovered,” Yang Kai warned at the end.

Mo Xiaoqi smiled and said, "Don’t worry, the Jiang Family’s old ancestor doesn’t live in Fenglin City; he’s in a villa outside, secluding himself for long-term cultivation."

Hearing that, Yang Kai relaxed.

As long as the Jiang Family had no Dao Origin Realm presence here, no one should detect him and Mo Xiaoqi. Although Mo Xiaoqi only had the Third Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation, she was secretive and her concealment arts were excellent; there was little worry of exposure.

The two arranged a rendezvous time and then split up to act separately.

Since Mo Xiaoqi had confirmed the old ancestor was absent, Yang Kai became bolder; he infiltrated the Jiang estate, released his Divine Sense, and easily swept through every corner and inch of the property.

But as time passed, Yang Kai’s expression grew increasingly grave.

He found no trace of Zhang Ruoxi in the Jiang Family.

Two hours later, when night had fallen, Yang Kai met Mo Xiaoqi again in a small alley not far outside the Jiang Family’s wall.

They looked at each other, and Mo Xiaoqi slowly shook her head.

Yang Kai’s face darkened and his brows tightened.

"Eldest Brother Yang, what now? Could anything have happened to Sister Ruoxi?" Mo Xiaoqi too became anxious; Zhang Ruoxi being neither seen nor heard from was the worst case, and though Mo Xiaoqi had never met the girl, her kind heart worried for her.

“I hope she’s all right.” Yang Kai’s face was grim as he pondered, then said, “If covert means won’t work, we must inquire directly — I hope the Jiang Family will not do anything to seal their own fate!”

Mo Xiaoqi gave Yang Kai a long, earnest look and nodded, “We’ll go together.”

Yang Kai had no objection.

A short while later, the two arrived at the Jiang Family’s main gate.

Two Jiang Family guards at the gate immediately stopped them; one of them seemed to realize Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi were powerful and did not dare be overly negligent, politely clasping his fists and asking, "May I ask why the two of you have come to our Jiang Mansion so late at night?"

Yang Kai returned the salute and said, “Please inform the Jiang Family head that Spiritual Pill Shop Pillmaster Yang Kai requests an audience.”

“The pillmaster of the Spiritual Pill Shop?” The gate guard was surprised, scrutinized Yang Kai, and then said solemnly, “Please wait — I will report to the family head at once.”

The Spiritual Pill Shop was well known in Fenglin City, being an enterprise set up by the Ziyuan Commerce Guild, and anyone who served as a pillmaster there and could refine Spiritual Pills was at least a Void King-Grade pillmaster.

With such a figure suddenly at their gate, the guard dared not be negligent and hurried inside to inform the family head.

Yang Kai had resorted to the pillmaster identity out of necessity.

His own name carried little weight in Fenglin City; only the identity of a pillmaster could make the Jiang Family take him seriously, give them pause, and make it safer to inquire into Zhang Ruoxi’s whereabouts.

The two waited less than a teacup’s time before a loud, hearty laugh echoed from within the Jiang estate; a voice called out before the person appeared, "Pillmaster Yang of the Spiritual Pill Shop graces the Jiang Family — you truly bring honor to us; I, Jiang Lin, welcome Pillmaster Yang!"

As the words fell, a ruddy-faced, roughly fifty-year-old man stepped out, warmly clasping his fists in greeting.

This man was the Jiang Family’s current head, Jiang Lin; he wore a cyan long robe and bore a dignified visage, his eyes contained restrained brilliance, and he did not look especially conspicuous.

But his Origin Qi was extremely pure; Yang Kai inclined his head inwardly, thinking the rumors that Jiang Lin would soon advance to the Dao Origin Realm were indeed true.

Behind Jiang Lin followed several other Third Stage Void King Realm warriors, all of considerable age and likely clan elders, among whom Jiang Chuhe’s figure was plainly visible.

When Jiang Chuhe saw Yang Kai, he was involuntarily taken aback and showed surprise.

He had not expected Yang Kai to be a pillmaster.

After all, he had seen Yang Kai previously at the Dragon Ascension Altar.
