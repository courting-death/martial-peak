## Chapter 262 — You Die, I Die

With the enhancement of the sword body, Wu Chengyi felt invincible!

He stood there like an unparalleled sword drawn from its sheath, a chilling sword intent enveloping a radius of several dozen zhang. The sword energy drifting in the air emitted a sizzling sound, slicing through the heavens and the earth like blades, leaving countless fine scratches on the ground in an instant.

Yang Kai sneered, unafraid, his True Essence also pushed to the limit, a violent force surging from his body, creating a series of explosive sounds from his not-so-strong physique.

The unmatched momentum rapidly rose, reaching its peak.

The two men’s auras were completely different; Wu Chengyi appeared indestructible, while Yang Kai was madly domineering. Even before they clashed, their auras clashed, stirring up gusts of wind on the ground, swirling between them without dispersing.

“Come!” Wu Chengyi roared, his expression twisted with madness as he wielded his long sword, striking out twice with a fierce slash.

The space seemed to be cut with a cross-shaped mark, and amidst Wu Chengyi's deep and thunderous roar, a cross-shaped sword energy suddenly appeared at that position, rushing towards Yang Kai like a falling star.

Yang Kai stomped his foot hard, causing the ground to tremble violently.

A fierce force erupted from his feet, the ground cracking like a spider web, with fissures spreading outwards from his feet, extending over a dozen zhang.

Like a swift wind, he charged towards Wu Chengyi.

In mid-air, he punched, directly hitting that cross-shaped sword energy.

With a loud explosion, the sword energy shattered, and Yang Kai's figure remained unimpeded, his momentum unabated.

Wu Chengyi's pupils constricted, and he no longer held back his exquisite sword techniques. His long sword danced, slicing towards Yang Kai in a flurry.

Yang Kai dodged repeatedly, but the only option left was to punch through the attacks he couldn't evade.

In just three breaths, Yang Kai had closed in beside Wu Chengyi.

The violent aura pressed down on Wu Chengyi like a wall, nearly suffocating him, and he displayed all his strength, retreating rapidly!

“Where do you think you’re going!” Yang Kai grinned maliciously, closing the distance. His iron fists, wrapped in True Essence, relentlessly struck at Wu Chengyi, who raised his sword to block, his sword techniques ethereal and agile, reaching the peak of perfection.

A dazzling array of lights and sword techniques erupted at their location, shooting out in all directions.

At first, their figures moved neither fast nor slow, but soon, both blurred into indistinct shapes. Moments later, they completely merged together.

A cacophony of sounds erupted.

In the span of half a tea's time, they had exchanged hundreds of blows!

“Boom!”

Their figures entangled, soaring to a height of over a dozen zhang. Then, they suddenly plummeted to the ground, creating a massive deep pit.

Swish, swish...

With leaps and bounds, Yang Kai and Wu Chengyi had darted several dozen zhang away, continuing their fierce battle.

Zi Mo watched from a distance, unable to blink, her beautiful eyes shimmering with excitement.

She was not worried about Yang Kai's life or death; she was astonished by the combat power he displayed.

“This brat has become much stronger!” Zi Mo bit her red lip, feeling both envy and admiration, a faint smile playing at the corners of her mouth.

The last time they parted, he had struggled against her Senior Brother Chi Xue, relying on that bizarre martial technique to control a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast to gain the upper hand.

But now, upon their reunion, he could actually match Wu Chengyi blow for blow.

In terms of pure combat power, Wu Chengyi was likely even stronger than Chi Xue.

Yang Kai's rate of growth made Zi Mo feel both envious and impressed.

In a daze, Yang Kai and Wu Chengyi had already dashed several hundred zhang away, and Zi Mo hurriedly followed, unwilling to miss such an intense and exciting battle.

Especially since this was a fight between martial artists of similar age and cultivation level.

Along the way, there were traces of blood, and it was unclear whether they belonged to Yang Kai or Wu Chengyi. Regardless, both had clearly fought with all their might, and it was impossible for them to hold back without a fight to the death.

By the time Zi Mo arrived, she saw the two men parting again, staring at each other from over thirty zhang apart.

Wu Chengyi's face was ashen, the calm demeanor he once had vanished, replaced by boundless madness, his eyes trembling in disbelief as he looked at Yang Kai.

A trickle of bright red blood seeped from the corner of his mouth, and his complexion was slightly pale, indicating he had sustained some light injuries.

In contrast, Yang Kai also bore several sword wounds, flesh torn and bloodied, especially on his fists, which were covered in countless fine sword marks!

With Wu Chengyi's sword body enhancement, both offense and defense were formidable; if Yang Kai wanted to injure him, he would inevitably hurt himself first.

Yet he continued to smile, a wicked grin on his face.

Bathed in the glow of the setting sun, covered in blood, with his hair flying wildly, he looked strikingly handsome, causing Zi Mo's pretty face to flush.

“I have been cultivating since I was eight…” Wu Chengyi suddenly spoke, his voice somewhat hoarse and trembling, “It has been fourteen years. Throughout my life, I have been considered invincible among my peers. No one is qualified to be my opponent; no one can defeat me! Even those young masters from the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu are not my match. Wherever my sword points, none dare to disobey.”

Taking a deep breath, Wu Chengyi's expression grew serious: “You are quite impressive! A First Stage True Essence Realm martial artist can actually fight me to a standstill. Today, I, Wu Chengyi, have gained insight; it turns out there are talents in this world, and I have been too ignorant!”

“Awakening before death, you won’t have lived in vain,” Yang Kai sneered.

Wu Chengyi raised an eyebrow and coldly snorted, “Do you really think you can defeat me? I have yet to unleash my full strength!”

“I have not unleashed mine either!” Yang Kai's eyes turned icy, a slight smirk appearing at the corners of his mouth, holding a mysterious smile.

Upon hearing this, Wu Chengyi narrowed his eyes.

“Then let us see who dies first!” Wu Chengyi's competitive spirit was fully ignited, and he shouted fiercely.

From childhood to now, he had enjoyed the praises of elders and the admiration of peers. The Jiu Xing Sword Sect regarded him as their future hope, and some had even predicted that if Wu Chengyi truly grew, the Jiu Xing Sword Sect would qualify to enter the ranks of superpowers.

Such an arrogant person could not accept being injured by an opponent whose realm was far below his own.

At first, Yang Kai wanted to take his life.

Now, even if Yang Kai wanted to withdraw, Wu Chengyi would never agree.

Between the two, a victor must be determined; one of them would die here! Either Wu Chengyi or Yang Kai! The one who survives will be the true genius!

In the realm of martial arts, there is no first in literature, nor second in martial prowess! But in Wu Chengyi's view, he was the first among the younger generation! Anyone who attempted to encroach upon his position was an enemy to the death.

After the fierce shout, Wu Chengyi's frenzied expression suddenly calmed, and a chilling sword intent spread out, causing Zi Mo's expression to change as she swiftly retreated, distancing herself by several dozen zhang before stopping.

Yang Kai's expression also abruptly became serious.

“I have only one move. If you can take it, you win; if you cannot, you die!” Wu Chengyi roared, his True Essence suddenly transforming into blades, flying out from various acupoints in his body, and the sword body he had enhanced suddenly shattered.

He abandoned defense, converting all his True Essence into offense.

In an instant, Wu Chengyi was surrounded by hundreds of sword energies.

Each of these sword energies was transformed from True Essence, containing immense lethality and formidable destructive power. With hundreds of sword energies unleashed, anyone would have to avoid their sharpness.

But that was not the end; as the long sword trembled again, another hundred sword energies surged forth...

Following that, yet another hundred...

The overwhelming sword energies surrounded Wu Chengyi, making the entire world seem like a realm of swords.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, not daring to hold back, reaching out to summon the Shura Sect's treasured artifact, the Shura Sword, which appeared in his hand.

The True Essence in his meridians retreated into his Dantian for storage, and the energy from his Proud Bone Golden Body surged forth mightily.

Black aura swirled around him, and various unsettling energies erupted from Yang Kai.

The energy within his Proud Bone Golden Body was an evil energy, entirely different from the pure and yang True Yang Primordial Qi.

This energy, filled with the aura of slaughter and destruction, resonated with the aura of the Shura Sword. Yang Kai's intention was merely to maximize the power of this treasure, but he did not expect that when wielding the Shura Sword and channeling the energy from his Proud Bone Golden Body, the Shura Sect's treasured artifact seemed to come alive, frantically devouring the energy from his Proud Bone Golden Body.

In an instant, the Shura Sword erupted with a mixed red and black light!

This light resembled a black hole; when it erupted, it devoured all brightness, and the entire world lost its color in that moment.

Zi Mo in the distance felt her vision darken.

Wu Chengyi's sword energy also suddenly dimmed.

Clang...

A sound of sword ringing emanated from the Shura Sword, and the sound and energy ripples affected Wu Chengyi's countless sword energies, causing them to resonate at the same time.

The sword energies trembled, as if they were about to break free from Wu Chengyi's control and shoot out.

Wu Chengyi's expression changed drastically, hurriedly stabilizing his mind to control his sword energies, preventing them from being influenced by the Shura Sword.

Yang Kai was astonished as he sensed all of this, and then his eyes burst with joy, continuing to pour energy into the Shura Sword. At that moment, he comprehended the secret hidden within this heavenly-grade treasure, establishing a subtle connection between himself and the sword.

The Shura Sword seemed to become a part of his body, blood and essence merging.

Both sides in the battle were desperately accumulating their final strike, staring coldly at each other from several dozen zhang apart.

Wu Chengyi was surrounded by over two thousand sword energies.

As the last few sword energies erupted from his body, this elite disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect suddenly lost all color in his face, turning pale, panting heavily, as if he had become an ordinary person without the strength to lift a chicken.

“This is the unpassed secret of my Jiu Xing Sword Sect, the Ten Thousand Swords Return to One!” Wu Chengyi coldly declared, a hint of regret on his face, “Unfortunately, with my strength, I can only manifest over two thousand sword energies! This is all the True Essence I have transformed!”

Yang Kai held the ringing Scarlet Blood Sword, grinning, “I don’t know what my move is called, but its power is definitely not small, so be careful!”
