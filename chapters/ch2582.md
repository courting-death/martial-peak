## Chapter 2582 — Departure

Inside the Elder’s treehouse, the Stone Spirit Elder and the Wood Spirit Chief, who had been notified by Xiaoxiao, were overjoyed. They secretly felt that their efforts had not been in vain, as they had finally persuaded Yang Kai to agree to the two tribes’ request.

The two of them even came together, taking the initiative to enter Xiaoxiao’s treehouse.

Ruoxi and Xiaoxiao were sent outside, leaving only Yang Kai and the two tribe chiefs sitting cross-legged inside.

The Elder chuckled, clearly in a good mood, and Mu Na’s face was also beaming with joy, unable to hide her delight.

Only Yang Kai wore a sour expression, dampening the atmosphere.

“Elder, let me make it clear first. I’ll help you, but if things become impossible, I’ll take Xiaoxiao and leave at once. The rest of you will have to fend for yourselves,” Yang Kai said, looking displeased.

“Of course, of course!” The Elder stroked his stone beard and nodded repeatedly. “If things really become impossible, we won’t force anything.”

Yang Kai nodded, “Since that’s the case, I have nothing more to say. Do you two have any plans?”

The Elder and Mu Na exchanged a glance, and the former said, “Rush over and send Shi Jiu into the Blood Gate—does that count as a plan?”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched and he snapped, “What kind of plan is that? The Blood Gate is currently watched by the Four Great Saint Venerables. At the slightest disturbance, the Eight Envoys and thirty-two Yao Kings will come howling. How do you plan to rush over?”

The Elder looked a bit embarrassed and said, “Guest, aren’t you proficient in space powers? Just take us with you.”

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed as he stared at him, “Did Xiaoxiao tell you that?”

He had never displayed his space powers in front of the Stone Spirit Race, yet the Elder knew. Clearly, he had learned it from Xiaoxiao.

Mu Na said, “Please don’t be angry, guest. Our two tribes bear you no ill will and will never reveal your secrets. This wasn’t something Shi Jiu told us directly. When he found us back then, the Elder learned it from his memories.”

Yang Kai’s voice grew colder, and he let out a chilly laugh, “So, what other secrets do you two know about me?”

The Elder coughed and said, “We also know you have a wondrous Secret Treasure of space, which can take us all along without anyone noticing.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but roll his eyes. They were even prepared to silence witnesses, but now he understood why the two tribes insisted on seeking his help, not even bothering to ask about his strength beforehand.

He possessed the Xuan Realm Pearl and was proficient in space powers, so he could indeed bring them all to the Blood Gate without anyone noticing. This was an advantage no one else could offer.

There was simply no one better to ask for help than him.

The Elder said, “Our plan is this: our tribespeople will hide in that Secret Treasure of space, and then you, guest, will use your space abilities to bring us to the Blood Gate. After that, you needn’t worry about anything else. As long as we get close to the Blood Gate, we have our own way to send Shi Jiu inside.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, “As far as I know, the Blood Gate is one of the two great forbidden grounds of the Wild Ancient Land. Normally, the creatures of the Wildlands can’t even get close, let alone enter. What method do you have?”

Mu Na smiled and said, “That’s true under normal circumstances, but now the Blood Gate has changed. The restriction has loosened a lot, so getting close isn’t a problem. The real issue is how to break the seal on the Blood Gate.”

The Elder said proudly, “With our overwhelming force, if my Stone Spirit Race acts together, we can smash any seal!”

Yang Kai’s face darkened, “You want to use brute force?”

The Elder raised his brows, “What’s wrong with that?”

Yang Kai slapped his own face and turned to Mu Na, “Chief, the Stone Spirits aren’t too bright, so their recklessness is expected. But why are you joining in?”

Mu Na gave a wry smile, “Is there a better way?”

Yang Kai was speechless, realizing the two tribes had no real plan at all. They were just being forced into action by the Four Great Saint Venerables’ ultimatum, taking a desperate gamble. If Xiaoxiao could really inherit Tai Yue’s power and become an Ancient Divine Spirit, then he could protect both tribes right under the noses of the Four Great Saint Venerables.

In short, it was do or die for the two tribes!

After a moment of silence, Yang Kai said, “Maybe I can try to tear open the seal on the Blood Gate. Since the Blood Gate seals the Divine Spirit Palace, there must be a small world inside. My space abilities might be able to tear open the boundary of that small world.”

The Elder immediately rubbed his hands, “If you’re willing to help, that’s best. But if not, we’ll still have to use brute force.”

The Elder had always seemed wise to Yang Kai, but now it was clear: a Stone Spirit was still a Stone Spirit. No matter how long they lived, they weren’t very bright and preferred to solve things with force. It was hard to imagine how the Wood Spirit Race had lived alongside them for so long.

“When do we set out?” Yang Kai asked the two.

“There’s no time to waste. Sooner or later, we have to go. In my opinion, we should set out at dawn tomorrow,” the Elder said solemnly.

Mu Na nodded slightly, clearly agreeing.

Yang Kai sighed, “Alright, go back and have your tribesmen prepare. Tomorrow morning… we depart!”

The Elder and Mu Na immediately took their leave, obviously going to inform their tribesmen.

Yang Kai remained seated cross-legged in the treehouse, deep in thought. This operation by the two tribes was nothing short of reckless—truthfully, Yang Kai didn’t hold out much hope for its success. The odds of failure were simply too high. What he needed to consider now was how to increase their chances of survival and improve the likelihood of success. After all, they would be acting right under the noses of the Four Great Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land. If those four Divine Spirits decided to intervene, even Yang Kai’s mastery of space might not be enough to guarantee a safe escape.

Maybe… Xie Wuwei could lend a hand.

Yang Kai spent the whole night racking his brains.

At dawn, the sound of orderly footsteps came from outside. Yang Kai opened his eyes and swept his Divine Sense out, immediately sensing that the entire Stone Spirit Race had mobilized. Not only them, but over a hundred Wood Spirits, led by Mu Na, were flying above the Stone Spirits’ heads.

The arrow was already nocked and had to be released. Yang Kai sighed, got up, and walked out.

When Yang Kai appeared, both tribe chiefs straightened up. The Elder said, “Guest, we’re ready.”

Yang Kai looked at Mu Na and frowned, “The Wood Spirit Race is going too?”

Although Mu Na and the Elder had discussed things with him yesterday, he hadn’t expected the entire Wood Spirit Race to go. This trip was extremely dangerous. The Wood Spirits weren’t good at fighting—if they got caught up in battle, any Yao King could wipe them out.

The Elder smiled, “The Wood Spirits live together with my Stone Spirit Race. They won’t participate in the fighting directly, but they’ll still be a great help. You don’t need to worry.”

Yang Kai frowned but didn’t ask further. He nodded, “If that’s the case, do as you wish.”

Turning his head, Yang Kai asked suspiciously, “Where’s Ruoxi?”

He couldn’t find Zhang Ruoxi. He’d been meditating in the treehouse all day yesterday and hadn’t seen her, thinking she was outside. But now he realized she was missing.

The Elder and Mu Na exchanged a glance and each turned to ask their tribesmen, “Has anyone seen that little girl?”

No one answered. Not only the few Stone Spirits, but even the hundred or so Wood Spirits had no idea where Ruoxi was.

Yang Kai’s face changed. His Divine Sense surged out like a tide, instantly covering thousands of li, but within its range, there was no sign of Ruoxi’s aura.

This left him both shocked and angry. How could a living person just disappear?

“Shi Jiu, do you know something?” the Elder suddenly asked in a deep voice.

Yang Kai turned to look and saw Xiaoxiao standing there, looking uneasy, scratching his head and glancing around nervously.

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat. He looked at him and asked, “Xiaoxiao, where did Ruoxi go?”

Seeing he couldn’t avoid it, Xiaoxiao immediately drooped his head and whimpered a few times.

Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. He looked in the direction of the Blood Gate and gritted his teeth, “That girl!”

Mu Na also covered her mouth in surprise, “She actually set out for the Blood Gate ahead of us?”

Yang Kai snapped angrily, “It must be because I stopped her from joining us yesterday that she went off on her own! When I catch her, I’ll tan her hide for this!”

He was furious. Ruoxi had always been obedient, but this time she’d dared to sneak off behind his back. How could this be tolerated?

Yang Kai raised his hand and knocked Xiaoxiao on the head, scolding, “Since you knew, why didn’t you tell me earlier?”

Xiaoxiao clutched his head and whimpered in grievance.

“There’s no point talking about it now. Guest, you’d better find her quickly. The area around the Blood Gate is crawling with yao. If she falls into their hands, things will get troublesome,” the Elder advised.

Yang Kai knew this as well, so he suppressed his anxiety and said, “Everyone, relax and don’t resist. No matter what you see inside, don’t be alarmed.”

With that, Yang Kai reached out to the two tribes. As the Laws of Space surged, the entrance to the Xuan Realm Pearl opened, and all the tribespeople were taken into the Small Xuan Realm.

The Incarnation, who had already been notified by Yang Kai, sat there grinning, ready to welcome the two tribes.

The Elder had said that the Stone Spirit Race never had more than ten members—any more, and they would die young.

Who knew what expressions they’d have when they saw the Incarnation? Yang Kai couldn’t be bothered to explain its uniqueness and, after collecting everyone into the Small Xuan Realm, immediately turned and sped toward the Blood Gate.

Along the way, Yang Kai constantly sent out his Divine Sense, hoping to find Zhang Ruoxi’s trail.

But since the girl had set out a day early, if she’d gone at full speed, she might already be near the Blood Gate. There was no way to find any trace of her along the way.

And that was indeed the case. At this moment, Zhang Ruoxi was already three hundred li outside the Blood Gate. She had made her way carefully, and though luck played a part, she hadn’t encountered any major trouble.

But now that she was here, she didn’t dare go any further. There were simply too many yao ahead, all of them openly displaying their auras. If she dared to show herself, she would definitely be discovered.
