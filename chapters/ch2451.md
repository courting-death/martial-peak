## Chapter 2451 — Natural Formation

“Brother Yang, you are indeed a dragon among men, but if you want to subdue the Mountain and River Bell, it’s not just about being handsome!” Qi Hai said, forcing himself to speak. He needed something from Yang Kai right now, so he couldn’t be too blunt, lest he offend him.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted as he said, “From what Brother Qi is saying, do you know a way to subdue the Mountain and River Bell?”

“Of course I don’t know how to subdue it, but I do have some information I can offer you, Brother Yang.”

“Oh? Let’s hear it!” Yang Kai’s interest was immediately piqued.

Qi Hai said, “Everyone knows the Mountain and River Bell is the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor’s Imperial Treasure, but in truth, it wasn’t originally his. It’s actually a primordial artifact!”

“A primordial artifact!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed at these words.

“That’s right!” Qi Hai nodded. “Origin Cauldron Great Emperor only managed to ascend to the rank of Great Emperor because he obtained the Mountain and River Bell. You could say it was the Mountain and River Bell that made his name as a Great Emperor.”

“There’s actually such a thing!” Yang Kai exclaimed in surprise. This was truly a secret. If Qi Hai hadn’t said it, he never would have known.

“Otherwise, how could the Mountain and River Bell suppress the True Phoenix Fire? Even after suppressing it, not even the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor could break its defense. If it were just an ordinary Imperial Treasure, it would be impossible to suppress such a divine fire for tens of thousands of years.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai felt it made sense. The True Phoenix Fire was so domineering, yet it had been suppressed by the Mountain and River Bell for tens of thousands of years. If the bell hadn’t flown off on its own this time, the True Phoenix Fire might never have seen the light of day again.

“So what’s the information you mentioned, Brother Qi?” Yang Kai asked in a deep voice.

Qi Hai’s expression grew solemn. “According to ancient records, back then, Origin Cauldron Great Emperor ventured deep into the Eastern Territory’s Wild Ancient Land and happened upon a great bell—the Mountain and River Bell. At that time, Origin Cauldron Great Emperor was just an ordinary Emperor Realm cultivator. He wanted to subdue the Mountain and River Bell but didn’t know how. In the end, he forcibly endured eighty-one rings of the bell before finally gaining its recognition and bringing it out of the Wild Ancient Land.”

“So the Mountain and River Bell actually came from the Wild Ancient Land!” Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. He’d heard Qi Hai mention the Wild Ancient Land before but hadn’t paid much attention. Now that he knew the Mountain and River Bell originated there, he realized what an extraordinary place it was and secretly decided to visit if he ever had the chance.

Still, Origin Cauldron Great Emperor actually endured eighty-one rings of the bell before gaining the recognition of the Mountain and River Bell’s Artifact Spirit. That was truly remarkable.

Yang Kai had experienced the might of the Mountain and River Bell himself. A Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator would be killed instantly if they touched it up close. He wasn’t confident he could withstand eighty-one rings.

By telling him this, Qi Hai was undoubtedly providing Yang Kai with a method to subdue the Mountain and River Bell. But the danger was immense.

“Brother Yang, if you’re not absolutely sure or don’t have the right opportunity, I advise you not to bother with the Mountain and River Bell. There are plenty of good things in this Shattered Star Sea. We could travel together…”

Before he could finish, Yang Kai interrupted, “I still want to take a look.”

Qi Hai’s face dimmed. “If that’s the case, I won’t say more. Take care, Brother Yang.”

“Thank you, Brother Qi. Until we meet again!” Yang Kai grinned, and with those words, his figure shot off into the void.

Qi Hai stood where he was, watching Yang Kai’s back with a complicated expression. After a long while, he sighed heavily and left in another direction alone.

He didn't know Yang Kai well. The fact that Yang Kai agreed to visit the Qi Family Stronghold in the Eastern Territory if he had the chance was already quite generous. If it were someone else, they might not only ignore him but even kill him to silence him.

After all, Qi Hai had just witnessed Yang Kai subdue and suppress the True Phoenix Fire with his own eyes. If word of this got out, Yang Kai would never have a peaceful life again.

Precisely because of this concern, Qi Hai had taken the initiative to swear never to reveal what he had seen.

But he had no confidence that Yang Kai would actually visit the Qi Family Stronghold.

If Yang Kai didn’t go, his wife would surely die. But even if Yang Kai did go, given her condition, there was only the slimmest chance she’d survive.

……

Yang Kai chased in the direction the Mountain and River Bell had flown for half a day before suddenly sensing the Divine Soul mark he’d planted on Lan He earlier.

When Lan He had passed by him before, he’d deliberately patted her shoulder to plant the Divine Soul mark, making it easier to track her. As for whether it would make her unhappy or suspicious, that was unavoidable.

Without this Divine Soul mark, Yang Kai would have had no way to track the Mountain and River Bell’s whereabouts.

Following the mark’s direction, he sped through the void. After another hour, he finally spotted Lan He in a certain area.

What surprised him was that Lan He was actually fighting someone—and being besieged.

Yang Kai looked closely and saw that her two attackers were both Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivators, both quite strong. Lan He was fighting two at once and looked rather battered, already covered in blood from numerous wounds.

Scanning the surroundings, he saw that nearly all the dozens of cultivators who’d appeared in the crimson star earlier were here.

The Mountain and River Bell was floating motionless in the void.

Everyone stared at the Mountain and River Bell with eyes full of greed and desire, but not a single person dared to make a move. This struck Yang Kai as odd—he couldn’t figure out what was going on.

What reassured him a little was that Yin Lesheng of the Netherworld Sect was also here and hadn’t left. This discovery let Yang Kai breathe a little easier. The Shattered Star Sea was vast; if he lost track of Yin Lesheng here, he’d have no idea where to look for him.

Almost everyone was quietly floating in the void, except for Lan He, who was fighting her two opponents. So when Yang Kai arrived, he immediately drew a lot of attention. Yin Lesheng glanced at him indifferently, but since Yang Kai was still wearing his mask, he wasn’t worried about being recognized.

“Don’t come any closer!” As Yang Kai rushed over, Lan He, who was fighting and at a disadvantage, suddenly shouted in his direction.

The moment she was distracted, she suffered two more wounds, blood spurting everywhere.

Yang Kai stared at her in surprise, not understanding why she was stopping him, especially while she was being besieged. If it was because of his earlier actions, that seemed a bit too sensitive.

But soon, Yang Kai understood her intention.

As soon as he rushed over, he sensed something strange all around him.

There was actually a natural formation hidden in the void here, extremely well-concealed and dangerous.

From the outside, there was no way to detect it. But once inside, he felt completely enveloped by danger, with no way to find an exit.

No wonder no one dared to approach the Mountain and River Bell even though it was right in front of them. The spot where it rested seemed to be the most dangerous part of the entire natural formation—one wrong move and everything would be set off.

Realizing this, Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Glancing around, he saw the dozens of cultivators all looking at him with schadenfreude, their faces full of mockery.

Yang Kai snorted coldly and shouted, “What are you all looking at, you bunch of trash? Believe it or not, I’ll gouge your eyes out!”

He’d accidentally rushed into the natural formation and was a bit annoyed. While it was normal for the others not to warn him, their gloating at this moment was infuriating.

As soon as he said this, dozens of eyes locked onto Yang Kai, killing intent instantly filling the air and freezing the entire space.

Every cultivator here was an elite of their respective sects, all proud and arrogant. Now they’d been called trash by Yang Kai—who could endure that?

What’s more, Yang Kai’s words had insulted everyone present. He was truly reckless and didn’t know his place.

Many people looked at Yang Kai as if he were already dead.

Yang Kai curled his lip, showing he didn’t care about the others at all. He turned to Lan He and asked, “What grudge do you have with these two that you have to fight here?”

Earlier, only Lan He had warned him not to come over, and that was while she was being besieged. This moved Yang Kai a little, so of course he couldn’t just stand by.

Lan He snapped, “Sect grudges, nothing personal!”

The reason she’d called out to Yang Kai earlier wasn’t to save his life. She just wanted him to pass a message to her sect about her situation. If she died here, at least someone would know.

But this idiot had charged right in, and now there was no way out.

Lan He realized that ever since she’d met this guy, nothing had gone smoothly. It was as if she was cursed by him.

One of the two men besieging Lan He suddenly shouted, “Wretched wench! Our sect’s Senior Brother was castrated by you—he’s now neither man nor ghost! And you dare claim there’s no personal grudge?”

As soon as these words were spoken, the crowd’s expressions became a spectacle, each more colorful than the last. Secretly, many couldn’t help but feel a pang of sympathy for that unfortunate Senior Brother—after all, for a man to be castrated was a truly miserable fate. Just thinking about it made many present instinctively wince, a chill running down their spines.

Lan He said coldly, “He used that thing to commit evil, so he deserved punishment!”

The man shouted angrily, “With your looks, no man in the world would be interested in you. I think you were just jealous, so you took it out on Senior Brother.”

The other man also jeered, “That’s right. As a woman, you’ve got nothing going for you. I bet you’ll never know what a man’s like in your whole life. If you don’t believe me, strip right now and see if any man here would even look at you.”

"That’s a woman?" one of the surrounding cultivators exclaimed, eyes wide.

"My eyes must be blind. I thought she was a man!"

"Tsk tsk, this woman is something else. Maybe she was born in the wrong body."

“Haha, you guys don’t get it. Women like her are the most fun to play with.”

“Hiss… Brother, you really have some unusual tastes.”
