## Chapter 926 — Barbarian Scum

The Hu Family sisters arrived at this entrance, which wasn’t far from the Xiaoyao Divine Cult, and of course the sect had already secured the place. Nearby petty powers and small clans might be jealous, but none dared to provoke the Xiaoyao Divine Cult.

At the harsh bark from the Saint Realm cultivator, Yang Kai and the others halted. Until they knew what was happening over in Zhongdu, Yang Kai had no intention of starting a fight.

The Saint Realm cultivator gave a faint nod, satisfied, hands clasped behind his back as he continued politely, “Please leave—this is territory of the Xiaoyao Divine Cult. If you wish to enter the Small Xuan Realm in search of opportunities, go elsewhere. Excuse any rudeness.”

His tone was courteous, clearly because he had sensed Li Rong and the others’ strength and therefore treated them with more caution; otherwise he would have driven them off long ago.

Shi Kun stepped forward, cupped his fist, and asked, “May I ask your name, friend?”

The man sized up Shi Kun, frowning with some reluctance. “Xiaoyao Divine Cult—Yu Chun.”

Shi Kun put on a familiar air and laughed, “So it’s Brother Yu—I've long admired you.”

Yu Chun nodded slightly and asked, “Who are you, and what brings you to the Xiaoyao Divine Cult’s territory?”

“From the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—Shi Kun!”

A murmur of surprise rose. Nearby cultivators, regardless of rank, turned their heads to look, and Yu Chun scrutinized Shi Kun from head to toe to see if he was lying.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s name had grown too loud in recent years; it was impossible not to pay attention.

The old Saint Lord had passed away, and a new Saint Lord had taken the throne—only that new Saint Lord was a green youth who consorted with demons, unrest followed, and a top alchemist had emerged…

Rumors of all kinds swirled, and for a time the Sacred Land’s renown was unmatched.

Yu Chun suddenly turned his gaze toward Yang Kai, suspiciously asking, “Could this be the Lord of the Nine Heavens?”

He had seen Shi Kun stand behind Yang Kai respectfully when he approached, so naturally he had his suspicions.

“He is indeed our Saint Lord,” Shi Kun nodded.

“Ah—Saint Lord Yang, no wonder you look familiar.” Yu Chun’s smile was odd and sudden.

“Where have we met?” Yang Kai frowned and asked.

“Saint Lord Yang is a man of great affairs and prone to forgetfulness; it’s only natural you wouldn’t remember me. But surely Saint Lord Yang still recalls my Divine Cult’s Cult Master, Wu Zheng?”

“Wu Zheng?” Yang Kai frowned harder, thinking for a moment before remembering, “The Wu Zheng we met outside the Nine Peaks?”

Over a year ago, Yang Kai had led the Ancient Demon Clan from the Endless Snow Mountain toward the Nine Heavens Sacred Land after sensing traces of massive demon activity. A host of human experts trailed him, and at the area outside the Nine Peaks Yang Kai and Li Rong went to parley with those masters. Among those who spoke with Yang Kai were Chu Yi of Tianmu Palace, Fang Yuebai of Mist Shroud Tower, and Wu Zheng of the Xiaoyao Divine Cult.

Those three were all cultivators at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

Yang Kai remembered that Chu Yi and Fang Yuebai left quickly once he guaranteed the Ancient Demon Clan would not run amok; only Wu Zheng wore a face full of hatred and unwillingness.

So Yang Kai naturally had a certain impression of him.

“Indeed.” Yu Chun nodded. “It seems Saint Lord Yang, though young, still has some memory. I had thought Saint Lord was as arrogant as ever; turns out you remember my sect leader.”

Shi Kun’s expression chilled when he heard that, and he grew hostile.

For some reason, Yu Chun seemed inclined to pick on the Saint Lord after learning Yang Kai’s identity, which made Shi Kun and company uncomfortable.

“Of course I remember,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile. “Come to think of it, our Sacred Land owes your sect some thanks—before our alchemist became well known, things were lively for a while.”

“What do you mean by that?” Yu Chun’s face shifted; he shook his head, “I don’t understand.”

“You know what I meant,” Yang Kai said coldly.

At that time many inexplicable cultivators had lingered outside the Nine Peaks seeking secret treasures or the like; it was obvious someone had been directing them.

Yang Kai suspected Wu Zheng was behind those moves. Seeing Yu Chun’s expression confirmed his suspicion.

But those were small matters, and Yang Kai didn’t intend to pursue them now.

Yu Chun seemed to see no point in arguing the matter further. He cast Yang Kai a sidelong glance and said, “May I ask what the Saint Lord intends, bringing your Sacred Land elders to my Xiaoyao Divine Cult? And if I’m not mistaken, that woman appears to be a demon.”

The cultivators guarding the Void Passage’s entrance instantly went pale and turned their attention toward Li Rong.

Yu Chun laughed out loud. “Saint Lord Yang, you’re bold. Consorting with demons is one thing, but daring to parade a demon around—do you think there are no humans left in the world?”

At his shout, the other four Saint Realm cultivators likewise showed hostile looks.

Humans and demons do not coexist. Whether there was old enmity with Li Rong or not, upon seeing a demon in human territory their first thought was to exterminate her.

Yang Kai’s patience thinned; he barked, “I don’t want trouble. I only want to enter this passage.”

“You think you can just march right in?” Yu Chun waved his hand. “Even a mighty dragon won’t crush a local snake—let alone when my Xiaoyao Divine Cult has no fear of your Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Saint Lord Yang, aren’t you being far too arrogant?”

“Whether you’re afraid or not is none of my business. I’m going in now. If you try to stop me, do your worst.” Yang Kai snorted and strode toward the Void Passage.

Yu Chun’s face hardened. He signaled the other four Saint Realm cultivators; the five of them moved in unison to block Yang Kai, a surge of force rolling out as they lowly warned, “Saint Lord Yang, if you proceed further, don’t blame us if we…”

Mid-sentence, Yu Chun’s expression changed drastically, as if an invisible hand had clamped down on his throat. He could no longer speak; his body trembled and sweat poured from his forehead.

His eyes brimmed with terror as he looked at the demoness.

Before she made any move, Yu Chun had thought her power considerable, but when she spread out her own pressure he realized she was beyond what he could bear.

Even with the other four joining him, there was no way they could hope to contend with her.

She was plainly a top expert at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Realizing that, Yu Chun’s face went through wild changes.

Yang Kai had already led the group past them. Casting him a glance, he said, “If we go any farther, what will you do?”

Yu Chun could neither move nor speak—how could he answer?

Hu Jiao’er sneered and made a face at him, acting outrageously. She and Hu Mei’er had tried to return from here months ago, but Xiaoyao Divine Cult disciples had mercilessly driven them off, which had angered her.

Seeing Yang Kai’s show of force now, her heart stirred with excitement.

A man in a position of strength has a certain irresistible aura, and she watched him with glittering eyes.

Before long the party reached the Void Passage. The surrounding cultivators trembled and no one dared intervene.

Yang Kai frowned and focused his attention on the Void Passage entrance, which floated some ten zhang above the ground.

At the entrance, light flickered unsteadily, and after a short while figures began to step out of the Void Passage.

First to appear were a few Xiaoyao Divine Cult disciples; once they materialized they gathered near the entrance, grinning as if in high spirits.

After a moment, more people came out one after another.

But this group looked bedraggled and dispirited, their strength suppressed—clearly they had been restrained.

Stepping out, they looked around helplessly with dim eyes, as though they could see no light.

“Hurry up—what are you dawdling for?” the first Xiaoyao disciples scolded, brusquely throwing them to the ground.

Thud, thud…

One by one the cultivators were thrown down, cries of pain rising.

The Hu Family sisters covered their mouths and whispered, “They’re disciples of Fengyu Tower!”

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed and his expression turned grim.

“This little one is quite pretty, hahaha.” Another woman emerged from the Void Passage—petite and charming, with a full figure—and a Xiaoyao disciple leered and chuckled lecherously.

A man followed closely behind the woman; upon hearing the lewd remark he stepped forward to shield her and glared at the leering Xiaoyao disciple.

“Du Yishuang! Fang Ziqi!” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched.

And the woman who stepped out first was none other than Fengyu Tower’s Little Sister Du.

Years ago, during the trials in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, Yang Kai had worked with her. The man now protecting her was naturally Fengyu Tower’s senior disciple, Fang Ziqi.

Years had passed, and Fang Ziqi had reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm, but such cultivation still paled before the Xiaoyao disciples—moreover, his strength was currently sealed.

Offended by Fang Ziqi’s stance, a Xiaoyao disciple lashed out and struck him. A bolt of force slammed into Fang Ziqi, sending him tumbling through the air for several rolls before he crashed heavily to the ground.

“Barbarian scum, overreaching yourselves!” The Xiaoyao disciple treated it as nothing, glanced about, then flew down and, cupping his fists toward Yu Chun, reported, “Elder Yu, our leader ordered us to escort these people back for you to deal with as you wish. The leader said that although their cultivation is poor, they can be used for labor—mining, hauling—quite useful. There are also many good-looking women among them who can be awarded to disciples who perform meritorious service.”

“Elder Yu?”

The Xiaoyao disciple finished his report and found Elder Yu showing no reaction, which puzzled him. He looked up and discovered Elder Yu drenched in sweat, his face contorted with strain. For a long moment he stood there stunned, not knowing what to do.
