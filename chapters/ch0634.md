## Chapter 634 — You Know It Yourself

After undergoing such a tremendous calamity, everyone was a little worn in body and spirit; even knowing that dozens of precious Gold Devouring Beasts lay buried beneath the collapsed mine, and that they would not so easily perish, neither Yun Xuan nor Ruan Xinyu wished to bother hunting those Gold Devouring Beasts any longer.

Instead, Ruan Xinyu produced a small Spatial Pouch and handed it to Yang Kai.

"What is this for?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Ruan Xinyu smiled faintly. "Your spoils. While you were resting, I found it on that Enchantress. Guess what’s inside."

Yang Kai weighed the pouch in his hand and stated plainly, "It should be refined precious ore."

"How did you know?" Ruan Xinyu was immediately taken aback.

Yang Kai shook his head with a smile. "The Enchantress hinted at such matters before. She claimed those Gold Devouring Beasts were hers; if so, their appearance here was not accidental but deliberate—she brought them to this place to let them devour the Ri Xi Ore and collect the products after the beasts had refined it. Besides, when we searched the cavern we found not a trace of refined ore excreted by the Gold Devouring Beasts; those materials should already have been gathered by the Enchantress, likely kept in this very Spatial Pouch."

At his analysis, a new light flashed in Yun Xuan’s beautiful eyes.

Ruan Xinyu also seemed to regard him with altered eyes. "You, for all you look like you are nothing, are quite meticulous in thought."

She pursed her lips and smiled. "There are quite a number of refined Ri Xi Ore pieces inside; taken out and sold, they’d fetch a hefty sum in Crystal Stones."

Yang Kai thought for a moment and tossed the Spatial Pouch back. "You suffered such great losses; when you return you should have an explanation to give the Duao Alliance. Keep these things."

Ruan Xinyu's face brightened and she hurriedly accepted them. She had intended as much already, but since the Enchantress had been slain by Yang Kai, it would feel improper to snatch away the spoils.

Yun Xuan opened her mouth as if to say something, but no words came forth.

"Let's go. Leave this place first—I'll escort you to the nearby town." Yang Kai rose first; these words put Yun Xuan in thought, and she glanced at him with suspicion.

This place counted as the far edge of territory the Duao Alliance could control; about two or three days' journey from the forest there stood a not-small city they had passed on the road here.

Half a day later the three of them emerged from the forest. In a nearby village Yang Kai rented a horse cart, seating Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu inside while he took up the reins and drove them toward the town.

This tenderness and attentiveness made Ruan Xinyu view him with renewed respect, and Yun Xuan also smiled more than before.

The two women chatted idly until Yun Xuan, exhausted, lay her head down and fell asleep. Bored, Ruan Xinyu came out and sat beside Yang Kai, propping her chin in her hand, tilting her head and fixing her gaze upon the man who was concentrating on cracking the whip.

"Why are you staring at me?" Yang Kai felt a little uncomfortable under her attention.

"I'm wondering who you really are," Ruan Xinyu smiled. "You were so badly wounded—how can you be so full of life after only half a day?"

"My recovery ability exceeds that of ordinary people," he replied.

"I can see that," she nodded gently. "Youth is wonderful."

"Are you old, then?" Yang Kai sneered and glanced at her.

"Compared to you, I am already a middle-aged woman. Yun Xuan and I are both almost thirty," Ruan Xinyu said with a self-mocking smile.

"You and Yun Xuan—what is the situation between you? You were once so at odds, and now you act like close family. Are women all so fickle?"

At the question Ruan Xinyu fell silent, a trace of sorrow clouding her pretty face.

Yang Kai realized he had asked something he should not and hurriedly shrugged. "If you don't want to speak of it, then I won't pry."

Ruan Xinyu shook her head and spoke softly, "We should have been family... Do you know what Yun Xuan's true identity is?"

"I only know her status is somewhat extraordinary," Yang Kai answered casually. Both Master Ma of the Secret Treasure Hall and the Transcendent Realm expert Sun Ying had treated Yun Xuan with an ease bordering on respect—ordinary disciples of the Duao Alliance would not receive such treatment.

"She is extraordinary," Ruan Xinyu glanced back at the sleeping Yun Xuan and then said, "Yun Xuan is actually the daughter of our alliance leader."

Yang Kai stared at her in astonishment.

"I'm serious—her father is the leader of the Duao Alliance."

"Then why—" Yang began.

With such an identity Yun Xuan should not be doing tasks in person; she should be raised in comfort. Yet judging by her daily demeanor, she bore none of a highborn lady's airs.

"There are reasons," Ruan Xinyu breathed. "I'm only telling you because it's you—don't go blabbing this everywhere."

"Do I seem like the sort to blab?" Yang Kai rolled his eyes.

Ruan Xinyu fixed him with a serious look and nodded. "Yun Xuan once had a younger brother—his talent was extraordinary. From a young age he showed a genius far above others. Because of the Duao Alliance's special system, the leader deliberately had him start from the bottom to train; he went out on missions with the rest of the Alliance and performed admirably. Through his own ability he rose from an ordinary disciple to a squad leader and gathered a number of subordinates."

Recalling those sweet memories, Ruan Xinyu's face brimmed with smiles as she recounted many of the missions.

To Yang Kai these accounts were awfully dull, yet he did not interrupt.

"But those who walk by the river often get their shoes wet," Ruan Xinyu's voice suddenly fell somber. "On one mission the young master met with misfortune and died; the squad was almost entirely wiped out, with only one person surviving by a thread—much like the situation now."

"Yun Xuan cared greatly for her younger brother. Because of his death she blamed the alliance leader—if he had not insisted the young master begin from the bottom, he might not have met that fate. From that time Yun Xuan renounced her ladyship and, like her brother, entered the Duao Alliance and began from the grassroots..." Ruan Xinyu's eyes reddened and her voice choked with sorrow.

Yang Kai remained indifferent, showing no expression.

"Her actions were clearly a protest against the alliance leader and a desire to continue the young master's unfinished business," Ruan Xinyu sighed. "Do you know why Yun Xuan does not hate you for taking her body? Why afterward she made no effort to pursue you?"

"Why?"

Ruan Xinyu gave a bleak smile and added, "Because when her brother died he was only twenty years old, at the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage. He was like you are now—full of vigor. She could not bring herself to hate you."

Yang Kai drew a breath and, after a moment's thought, asked, "The only survivor of that young master's squad was you, wasn't it?"

Ruan Xinyu was startled, then slowly nodded. "Your mind is sharp. Yes—I was a member of the young master's squad. Because he gave his life to save me, I survived. It was because of that I and Yun Xuan had our conflict. But I know she does not blame me; she simply cannot face me—seeing me only makes her think of him."

"Did you love that man?" Yang Kai asked with a grin.

Ruan Xinyu's cheeks flushed and she shot him an annoyed glance. "Why do you ask that? That was long ago."

"Then why tell me all this?" Yang Kai shook his head.

Ruan Xinyu glared at him, scolding him inwardly for pretending ignorance. He clearly understood everything but acted innocent on his face.

Yang Kai's expression grew serious and, after pondering for a long time, he shook his head. "I will not join the Duao Alliance. Do not try to persuade me. Although I sympathize with Yun Xuan's suffering and admire her persistence and effort, I have my own affairs to attend to."

"You bastard!" Ruan Xinyu cried aloud in exasperation. "Having benefited so greatly, do you really intend to leave just like that?"

"What benefit did I take?" Yang Kai asked.

"Don't play dumb—you took Yun Xuan's... her..." Ruan Xinyu trailed off.

"Which part?" he asked.

"You know it in your own heart." Ruan Xinyu was angry and thought what a shameless young man he was, so bold as to lie with his eyes open.

"Anyway, you'll be held responsible!" Ruan Xinyu immediately began to play the rogue. "If you don't join the Duao Alliance, I'll expose this and have everyone in the Alliance come after you!"

Yang Kai shot her a wicked look and let out a low chuckle.

Ruan Xinyu shivered and clutched at her clothes, trembling. "What do you mean by that?"

Yang Kai lifted his head and glanced at the sky, his voice low: "A dark moon and high wind—an excellent night."

Ruan Xinyu turned pale, suddenly realizing that with his abilities if he truly wished to harm her, she would have no means of resistance.

In this desolate wilderness, if he were to rape and then kill her, likely no one would ever learn of it.

Just as her heart was clenching with dread, a weak voice came from inside the cart. "You two... stop this."

Ruan Xinyu was startled, stuck out her tongue at Yang Kai, and hurried back into the carriage.

A short while later she came out again, supporting Yun Xuan, and they sat together up front, breathing the cool night air.

"You really intend to leave?" Yun Xuan asked Yang Kai with a touch of sorrow in her eyes.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded in a serious tone.

"That is for the best. The Duao Alliance is too small to contain someone like you; it will do you well to go see the world." Yun Xuan tightened her clothing against the chill and, after a moment, said softly, "In any case, I must thank you for what you did."

"Are you foolish?" Ruan Xinyu looked at her in disbelief.

"If not for him, Uncle Sun and Ji Hong's grievances would not have been avenged; we would have died there. Of course we should thank him," Yun Xuan replied.

Ruan Xinyu frowned. It was true—without Yang Kai, they might well have been annihilated this time.

"You need not thank me; I acted only to protect myself," Yang Kai said, shaking his head.

Yun Xuan smiled bitterly and fell silent. After a moment she said softly, "Xinyu, help me back inside; it's cold out here."

"All right." Ruan Xinyu nodded, helped Yun Xuan back into the carriage, and soon even breaths could be heard inside. Yang Kai glanced back and saw the two women asleep, arms about each other, expressions peaceful.
