## Chapter 2206 — Ziyang Profound Light Barrier

With Yang Kai’s current cultivation and Alchemist rank, producing five Supreme Mystic Pills in one batch was largely due to luck.

He had secretly estimated he could only refine three pills, so he was greatly surprised by the final result.

The only thing Yang Kai regretted was that, among those five Spiritual Pills, not a single one bore Pill Patterns. This was understandable—Supreme Mystic Pills were already extremely difficult to produce, and if Pill Patterns appeared as well, that would truly be heaven-defying.

In the days that followed, Yang Kai stayed on Feiyan Peak, cultivating in peace and patiently waiting for news from Qingyang Shrine.

Searching for a Calamity Fruit was not something that could be accomplished in a day or two. The three-month deadline Yang Kai had given was entirely for Qin Yu’s sake—her body and age could not wait any longer.

And Qingyang Shrine was the only hope for both her and Yang Kai.

Feiyan Peak was located in a remote, tranquil part of the Qingyang Mountain Range, so no one came to disturb Yang Kai.

But to Yang Kai’s surprise, after a few days, an unexpected guest arrived.

The visitor was none other than Gao Xueting.

This surprised him greatly, so he did not dare be negligent; he welcomed Gao Xueting into the main hall and served her attentively.

He had thought Gao Xueting had come to see him for some reason, but it turned out not to be the case. This cold and aloof Emperor Realm expert spent most of the day with Yang Kai, simply asking about his cultivation, like a senior questioning a junior about his progress in the Martial Dao.

Yang Kai answered each question carefully after some thought, but from Gao Xueting’s expression, he couldn’t tell if she was satisfied with his answers.

Since it was rare to have such close contact with an Emperor Realm expert, Yang Kai also took the opportunity to ask about things he didn’t understand. Gao Xueting held nothing back, explaining everything as simply and clearly as possible.

Yang Kai learned a great deal from it.

Before leaving, Gao Xueting asked to test the strength of Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

Although Yang Kai was puzzled, he did not refuse. He gathered his Divine Sense and sent it toward Gao Xueting.

She received it calmly, unmoved. However, she gave Yang Kai a meaningful look, as if she could tell he hadn’t used his full strength.

Before departing, Gao Xueting left something for Yang Kai.

After seeing Gao Xueting off, Yang Kai was left confused, not knowing what Elder Gao’s purpose had been in visiting him. From their previous trip to the Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai knew she was not an easy person to get along with.

Her difficulty wasn’t due to a bad temper, but her naturally cold demeanor—her face always distant, warning strangers to keep away.

Still, Yang Kai could sense that Gao Xueting was not a bad person.

Staring at the item in his hand, Yang Kai frowned and muttered to himself, “No explanation at all—what’s this for?”

The item in his hand was exactly what Gao Xueting had given him before leaving. It looked like a small bell, about the size of a palm. Its surface shimmered with mysterious light, and it radiated a strong energy from within. Gao Xueting had called it the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier!

This was a Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure!

And it was no ordinary Secret Treasure—it was a Divine Soul Secret Treasure!

Divine Soul Secret Treasures were made from extremely special materials and could only be controlled with Divine Sense. Origin Qi was useless for such treasures.

In terms of rarity and value, Divine Soul Secret Treasures were several grades above ordinary Secret Treasures.

So, even though this little bell was only Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level, its true value might rival or even exceed that of an Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure.

Judging by its form, it was clearly a defensive Secret Treasure. If refined into the body, it could protect the Sea of Consciousness and Divine Soul from harm.

Yang Kai had never owned a Divine Soul Secret Treasure. When he was weaker, he had a small sword for attack, but as his strength grew, it had long since been discarded.

Besides, he had developed the Blooming Lotus secret technique himself, whose power and mystery surpassed most Divine Soul Secret Treasures, so he had never considered collecting such items.

Gao Xueting’s gift happened to make up for this shortcoming…

With this Secret Treasure’s protection, combined with Yang Kai’s powerful Divine Soul, it would be very difficult for anyone to injure his Sea of Consciousness with a sneak attack.

As the saying goes, one does not refuse a gift from a senior. Although Yang Kai was not a disciple of the Shrine, Gao Xueting was still an Emperor Realm expert, so when she gave him this Secret Treasure, he accepted it with thanks, without overthinking it.

Now, it seemed he needed to spend some time refining it.

Since he had nothing else to do while waiting for news, he decided to start refining the Secret Treasure.

With that thought, Yang Kai didn’t hesitate. He sat down cross-legged, released his Divine Sense, and enveloped the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier.

More than ten days passed in a flash.

During these days, Yang Kai sat cross-legged in his room, not moving an inch, working hard to refine the Ziyang Profound Light Barrier.

After all this effort, he had managed to refine about a third of the treasure’s restrictions, allowing him to store it in his Sea of Consciousness and activate a small portion of its power.

But to fully refine it would require more time.

The Ziyang Profound Light Barrier truly lived up to its name as a Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level Divine Soul Secret Treasure. Its power seemed immense—even now, it had become a layer of purple light, covering the outside of Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness and forming a strong, resilient defense.

If anyone wanted to harm Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, they would first have to break through this purple barrier.

Since it wasn’t fully refined yet, Yang Kai didn’t know if it had any other functions, but even this much was enough to look forward to.

One day, Yang Kai suddenly sensed something and quickly opened his eyes. At the same time, a voice sounded from outside the door, calling loudly, “Brother Yang, I’ve come to see you!”

As soon as Yang Kai heard the voice, he knew it was Xia Sheng.

As soon as he finished speaking, Xia Sheng pushed the door open and entered.

Another voice sounded, “Senior Brother, you didn’t even wait to be invited in. What if you disturbed his cultivation?”

This was Xiao Baiyi.

“Exactly! What if Junior Brother Yang was comprehending some secret technique? Senior Brother, don’t be so reckless!” Murong Xiaoxiao’s voice followed, sounding quite worried.

“Ah…” Xia Sheng scratched his head awkwardly, caught in a dilemma. “What should I do? I already called out…”

“It’s fine, please come in, everyone!” Yang Kai replied.

Xia Sheng’s expression relaxed, and he laughed heartily as he entered.

“Sorry to intrude!” Xiao Baiyi said, following him in.

Soon, the group appeared before Yang Kai.

To Yang Kai’s surprise, besides Xia Sheng, Xiao Baiyi, and Murong Xiaoxiao, Shen Muji was also there.

He and Yang Kai were not close, having only met a few times, so they simply nodded in greeting.

Xia Sheng enthusiastically introduced everyone to each other.

The guest room was simple, so Yang Kai didn’t invite them to sit. Instead, he looked at Xia Sheng and asked, “Did you all come together to tell me something?”

Xia Sheng nodded mysteriously. “The Hall Master has summoned us!”

“Me too?” Yang Kai frowned.

The others were all Qingyang Shrine elites, so it made sense for them to be summoned. But from Xia Sheng’s words, even Yang Kai was included, which puzzled him.

“Exactly!” Xia Sheng nodded seriously. “The Hall Master specifically told us to bring Brother Yang along.”

“Do you know what it’s about?” Yang Kai asked.

“It’s a good thing!” Xia Sheng grinned.

Xiao Baiyi added, “Didn’t the Hall Master say something last time we left? I think we’re going to receive rewards this time.”

“Rewards…” Yang Kai’s expression turned odd. “But I already made a request to Hall Master Wen. Is he going to reward me with something else?”

Xia Sheng smiled. “How could that little request compare to the merit of your six Star Seals? The Hall Master is always fair with rewards and punishments. Brother Yang, your contribution to the Shrine is far more than just a small request can cover.”

“That’s right!” Xiao Baiyi nodded. “You noticed, didn’t you? This time, the Hall Master only summoned us, and we’re all people who handed in extra Star Seals. I, Xiaoxiao, and Junior Brother Shen only handed in one each and will be rewarded, let alone you, who handed in six at once.”

“Enough talk, let’s go! I can’t wait to see what the Hall Master will reward me with.” Xia Sheng looked impatient.

“Then… I’ll trouble you all to lead the way.” Yang Kai said politely.

With that, the five of them used their movement techniques and flew toward the main peak of Qingyang Shrine.

In no time, they arrived at Ten Thousand Saints Peak and headed straight for the main hall.

But as they crossed the threshold, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed. In that instant, he felt a mysterious force descend upon him, and before he could react, a sensation of weightlessness overtook him.

By the time the group passed through the hall doors, Yang Kai had already disappeared.

“Where’s Brother Yang?” Xia Sheng’s face changed dramatically, and he cried out in shock.

Xiao Baiyi, Murong Xiaoxiao, and Shen Muji all looked equally alarmed and serious.

“Don’t worry, the Hall Master just called him aside for a private talk.” A voice suddenly came from ahead. Everyone looked up and saw that it was Gao Xueting. At this moment, Elder Gao stood before them, as serene and distant as a blooming white lotus.

The group exchanged glances. Although they didn’t know why Wen Zishan had separated Yang Kai, they were no longer worried. They all greeted in unison, “Greetings, Elder Gao!”
