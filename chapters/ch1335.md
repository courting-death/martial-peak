## Chapter 1335 — You Still Want Benefits?

"Is that all?" Yang Kai asked in surprise after hearing him finish.

“That’s all there is to it,” Fei Zhi Tu said with a slow nod. “As for what comes after passing through that ice passage—disabling the various restrictions and rescuing Qian Tong—you need not trouble yourself over it. This City Lord will make the arrangements. If it weren’t for the lack of a suitable fire-attribute Secret Treasure to counter that ice tunnel, I wouldn’t have been delayed here for so long.”

Yang Kai stroked his chin and fell silent, pondering.

Fei Zhi Tu did not press him, letting him think; after all, this was a grave matter. Although it only required using an artifact spirit's power to break the ice passage's blockade, it was still an ancient ruin and could not be risk-free. Even an expert like Qian Tong was trapped inside and unable to escape, so Fei Zhi Tu could not say what might be encountered on that trip.

Matters of life and death deserved careful consideration.

Still, he had some confidence in Yang Kai. As the City Lord of Tianyun City, he knew Dragon Lair Mountain well. Even if he had never met Yang Kai before, he'd heard the rumors enough times to know Yang Kai was not an ungrateful scoundrel.

Sure enough, after a long while Yang Kai finally lifted his head; a trace of determination flashed through his eyes—he had made up his mind. Fei Zhi Tu looked at him immediately.

"City Lord Fei, Elder Qian did me a favor at Dragon Lair Mountain. Since he is in trouble, this junior will naturally do his utmost to help him!"

Fei Zhi Tu nodded slightly at that, a hint of satisfaction on his face—this lad at least understood propriety and repaid favors.

But Yang Kai then changed tone and let out a low chuckle. "But what benefit do I get for doing this?" he asked.

"Benefit?" Fei Zhi Tu looked stunned, staring at Yang Kai. "You still want benefits?"

Yang Kai smiled wryly. "City Lord Fei, do you take me for so little? I'm past the age of reckless hot-bloodedness. This trip's outcome is uncertain. You don't expect me to follow for nothing after just a few words, do you? If I'm to take a risk, of course I'll want something in return."

Fei Zhi Tu's brows knitted; disappointment flitted across his face as he said coldly, "But the one you're going to rescue this time is Qian Tong!"

"So what? If Elder Qian himself sent for me, I'd have no choice but to go. But it's you inviting me, and we're not close. That means I should be paid—after all, when Elder Qian is rescued, he'll owe you the favor, not me. It has little to do with me."

"What twisted logic is this?" Fei Zhi Tu's face turned dark. He hadn't expected Yang Kai to make demands so bluntly. In his mind, inviting Yang Kai was already the greatest courtesy. Without that fire artifact spirit, at his Third Stage of the Saint King Realm he wouldn't qualify to participate in such an undertaking; if they rescued the man, would Qian Tong not be grateful to him?

How shameless this brat was! Fei Zhi Tu sniffed in anger.

"Whether it's twisted logic or not, City Lord Fei can judge that for yourself," Yang Kai replied calmly, unhurried.

Fei Zhi Tu glared at him in fury. After a moment, as if recalling something, he grinned slyly and said with crafty guile, "You want benefits? Then I'll give you benefits! Did you kill Xie Hongwen of the Xie Family?"

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he hastened to say, "City Lord Fei, one can eat whatever, but words must not be carelessly spoken. What evidence do you have that I killed Xie Hongwen?"

"Don't play dumb with me!" Fei Zhi Tu snorted. "You think no one knows? You think you did it with no one noticing?"

Yang Kai frowned, feeling the man wasn't bluffing, and adopted a humble, inquiring air. "Please explain yourself clearly."

Fei Zhi Tu sneered. "Many know the feud between you and Xie Hongwen. When the Flowing Flame Sandland opened last time, Xie Hongwen brought two Saint King Realm disciples of the Xie Family in specifically to find you and take revenge—everyone knows that. But he never came out. He clearly died in the Flowing Flame Sandland!"

"The Flowing Flame Sandland is perilous; even if he died in there, what does it have to do with me?" Yang Kai replied coldly, denying it outright.

"Do you not know that Yingyue Hall possesses a secret technique that can be applied by a senior onto a junior, and if that junior meets with misfortune, the technique transfers to the hand of the killer? Not only did Xie Hongwen have this technique—Wei Guchang, Dong Xuan'er, and those elite disciples had it too. Now that I've said it, do you understand?"

Yang Kai looked astonished. If Fei Zhi Tu wasn't lying, then it meant such a transfer technique had been placed on him—if so, his killing Xie Hongwen would long since be no secret.

"The Xie Family hasn't made a move against you for two reasons: one, they fear Qian Tong; two, after you returned from the Flowing Flame Sandland you rarely showed yourself, and Dragon Lair Mountain's defenses made it impossible for the Xie Family to trace whether that technique's source was on you. But the moment you leave Dragon Lair Mountain even once, your killing of Xie Hongwen will be exposed." Fei Zhi Tu gave a low chuckle. "If you come with me, I can help purge that parasitic secret technique, and I'll ensure the Xie Family won't trouble Dragon Lair Mountain again; I can even restore your trading ties with Yingyue Hall. Isn't that a considerable set of benefits?"

As he spoke, Yang Kai had already used his divine sense to examine himself, and after a moment his face turned unpleasant.

A faint energy had appeared inside him at some unknown time, hidden deep within his body. Without checking inch by inch he wouldn't have found it; even after Fei Zhi Tu's mention it took three thorough inspections before he located it.

It seemed to be that transferable secret technique of Yingyue Hall—indeed extremely concealed.

"You found it?" Fei Zhi Tu looked at him in surprise; though Yang Kai said nothing, his expression had revealed a clue.

This technique was exceedingly covert. As far as Fei Zhi Tu knew, Xie Li had planted it on Xie Hongwen; Xie Li had was of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and even peers of equal level might not detect the technique. How did this Third Stage Saint King Realm warrior manage it?

Fei Zhi Tu clicked his tongue in wonder, secretly suspecting Yang Kai had relied on some secret treasure's power.

Yang Kai didn't answer, instead wrapping the faint energy with his demonic flame and attempting to refine it. He discovered that although the energy was weak, refining it was extremely difficult—it would take several days at least to remove it completely.

But now that he'd found it, Yang Kai was not anxious. After a moment's thought, he looked at Fei Zhi Tu solemnly and said, "I accept half of your proposal."

"Half?"

"Yes. After this, Dragon Lair Mountain may restore its trade with Yingyue Hall, though the terms will need further negotiation. As for the Xie Family…" Yang Kai chuckled softly, "I have only one demand."

"Speak it," Fei Zhi Tu said, glancing at him.

"The Xie Family's business with me, Yingyue Hall must not intervene!" Yang Kai said sternly.

Fei Zhi Tu raised an eyebrow, astonished. He had assumed Yang Kai would ask Yingyue Hall to pressure the Xie Family and prevent them from troubling Dragon Lair Mountain. Who knew the youth would be so bold—he sounded like he intended to take the initiative against the Xie Family himself!

Realizing this, Fei Zhi Tu showed a look of interest.

The Xie Family wasn't top-tier, but they had several Origin Returning Realm experts and their family head was of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—could Dragon Lair Mountain contend with them in its current state? Was the boy not out of his mind?

Fei Zhi Tu didn't want to meddle in Yang Kai's feud with the Xie Family, nor did he particularly think the lad had the courage to act. He nodded. "No problem. As long as Qian Tong is brought out, I guarantee that even if you wipe out the Xie Family, Yingyue Hall will say nothing—provided you have the capability."

He looked utterly unconvinced about Yang Kai.

Yang Kai didn't argue. After settling the terms and setting the rendezvous time and place, he left the City Lord's mansion alone.

After Yang Kai departed, Fei Zhi Tu frowned. "Strange—why didn't the youth ask me to purge that secret technique's source? Does he have a way?"

After thinking a while, Fei Zhi Tu shook his head and shrugged; since the Xie Family already knew Xie Hongwen had died at Yang Kai's hands, whether the technique was removed or not no longer mattered.

At Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai returned without alerting anyone.

The rendezvous was three days away; he had preparations to make and could not reveal his movements, lest someone notice.

In those three days he intended to refine away that faint energy. Though Fei Zhi Tu had said the technique was only used to identify the killer of elite disciples, who could tell what other functions it might have.

Having such a thing inside him made Yang Kai uneasy.

Fortunately, the properties of demonic flame were extraordinary—no ordinary warrior's Saint Yuan could compare.

With the aid of the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit, it took him only two days to refine the energy away completely; after a final self-check he breathed easier.

Yang Kai then summoned Yang Yan, Wu Yi, Qian Yue, and the two Guest Elders, carefully instructing them not to go out during this time for fear of being watched by the Xie Family. After receiving their assurances, he returned to the stone residence to make brief preparations.

There wasn't much to prepare, but Yang Yan gave him many of the spherical Saint Crystals formed by Stone Puppets after purification and compression. These accidental Saint Crystals, whether in quality or the amount of spiritual qi contained, couldn't be compared with Upper-Level Saint Crystals; they were of great use for recovery, healing, and combat.

Yang Yan called the Saint Crystals produced by the Stone Puppet 'Origin Saint Crystals.'
