## Chapter 1239 — Artifact Spirit

However, a great many refining materials had indeed been collected.

Of the hundreds of stone chambers, not all were as bare as the first one Yang Kai inspected; some still held piles of materials used for forging, mostly ores and similar matter, along with a few odd trinkets — all the sort that can be preserved for a long time without decay.

There were truly quite a lot of them.

Even if only a tenth of the hundreds of chambers contained anything Yang Kai could take, it would still be significant.

Yang Kai felt dissatisfied because the haul did not match his expectations; it wasn’t as plentiful as he had imagined.

Still, while searching he discovered something that piqued his interest: the deeper he went, the denser and purer the gathered fire Spiritual Qi became in those alcoves.

This made sense — in the Earth-Lung Fire Pool, the farther down one went, the closer one was to the fire pool’s source. When he began to refine the Profound Yin Moon Water, he would need to find the alcoves located lower down.

Two days later, Yang Kai had already reached the depths of the Earth-Lung Fire Pool; at the deepest point, only two alcoves remained unchecked.

These two alcoves were built very deep, clearly intended for the sect’s most outstanding artificers to use. They sat one to the left and one to the right, not far apart. Their entrances looked ordinary and unremarkable, but ever since Yang Kai had seen some alcoves where the interior was a world of its own, he knew that without entering and investigating thoroughly, he could never know what might be inside.

Hoping for a discovery, Yang Kai thought and casually chose the alcove on the left; with a flash of movement he shot toward its mouth like an arrow loosed from a bow.

In the next moment he appeared within the alcove’s passage. Once steady, he kept moving deeper.

This alcove plunged several hundred zhang down. Yang Kai walked for a long while without reaching the end, which both amazed him and heightened his anticipation. Indeed, this was an alcove built for the sect’s top artificers — its depth was on another level. He wondered if anything worthwhile lay within.

After pressing forward another hundred zhang or more, a soft, pearly light suddenly appeared ahead. The glow was gentle, not piercing at all; it even had a calming, soul-settling effect. Seeing that pearly light, Yang Kai felt a relaxation sweep through him and an inexplicable sense of pleasure well up.

Quickening his step, he soon burst into an immense stone chamber.

This chamber was tens of times larger than any of the hundreds he had investigated over the past two days. Its vault soared dozens of zhang high. Some exquisite arrangement had been used in its design so that, even though it lay deep beneath the earth, the air inside remained clear and free of the slightest turbidity — a single point that made it incomparable to the other chambers.

The other chambers all carried a faint oppressive feel.

Around the chamber were eight fist-sized, snow-white spheres. The pearly glow came from these eight spheres; wherever their light passed, an odd calming of spirit and mind was produced.

Yang Kai raised a brow. After letting his gaze sweep once over the eight spheres, he focused his Divine Sense on the rest of the chamber.

But when he finished inspecting the chamber, the expectation he had harbored turned into profound disappointment and he sighed. For such a grand, awe-inspiring chamber, he had assumed it would surely contain something valuable.

To his surprise, this chamber was like most others: apart from a gigantic refining furnace set in the center, there was nothing else.

The formation within the chamber was still active, drawing the purest portion of the Earth-Lung Fire Pool’s flames and roasting that enormous cauldron for tens of thousands of years without cease.

When Yang Kai’s gaze swept over the refining furnace, his eyes brightened and a grin crossed his face.

He found the furnace intact — remarkably well preserved.

In those other chambers he had found several hundred refining furnaces; no matter how high their grade or how fine their craftsmanship, after tens of thousands of years of blazing heat most had been ruined and rendered useless.

Some had even been of Void King-Grade; seeing them broken pained Yang Kai greatly.

Now, to find a complete refining furnace here — whether by chance or some other cause — meant its quality had to be very high. It had to be a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure without doubt.

Only a furnace of such calibre could have survived.

Overjoyed, Yang Kai immediately began searching for the formation’s control nexus.

Unlike other chambers that had a single stone block serving as the formation’s control, this chamber had four stone blocks in total. It took Yang Kai some effort to halt the entire formation completely.

He had never cultivated an ice-and-cold attribute technique nor possessed such a Secret Treasure, so he could only wait for the furnace’s temperature to gradually subside.

About a day later the furnace’s crimson glow finally began to abate. Though it still looked blisteringly hot, Yang Kai considered his strength adequate and felt no fear.

He quickly approached the furnace, sent out his Divine Sense and verified his guess: the furnace truly was Void King-Grade. He could not yet decide its exact rank, but it was no lower than Void King-Grade Middle-Level. The whole cauldron stood five zhang tall, a three-legged, two-eared design. Unlike other furnaces he had seen, its surface bore the carving of a strange bird rather than dragons or phoenixes.

Circling the furnace, Yang Kai realized he did not recognize this bird. It resembled a phoenix yet bore the likeness of a crane: a long, pointed beak, powerful talons, and three long tail plumes. Its body was gracefully slender and each feather had been carved with lifelike accuracy, as if the bird might burst free from the furnace at any moment.

Studying it closely, Yang Kai silently recalled the tomes he had glanced through from Zong Ao and, pondering what sort of demonic beast the bird might represent, his expression suddenly shifted and his eyes narrowed toward the creature’s carved eyes.

At that instant, Yang Kai had felt a sensation as if he were being scrutinized by another.

Yet upon closer inspection the carved bird remained lifeless and unchanged, which left him utterly astonished.

That early warning prevented Yang Kai from becoming complacent. Who knew if something strange lurked within the furnace? He probed repeatedly with his Divine Sense and, after confirming there was nothing inside but a pool of burned material, he finally relaxed.

This furnace was a treasure that could not be missed. Though he had no use for such a gigantic cauldron in his alchemy since his Saint Yuan had been transmuted into Demonic Flame and he now relied on Divine Sense Fire, this could be brought back for Yang Flame to use. While she had the Stone Puppet to assist in pounding materials, and needn’t worry about tempering them, the final steps of forging a Secret Treasure — shaping and carving the sealing formation — still required a refining furnace.

Yang Flame had helped him much; of late she had devoted herself to setting formations and forging Secret Treasures for him. The two shared the secrets of the Stone Puppet and the Ethereal Crystal, so even if this cauldron was a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure, Yang Kai would not begrudge giving it to her.

With that decided, Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense, enveloped the great furnace and attempted to draw it into his Spatial Ring.

At that moment an anomaly occurred. The furnace, which had nearly cooled, suddenly hummed and clusters of astounding flames rose from its rim, flames that surged as if to lay waste to everything.

Those tongues of fire were like a prairie fire in momentum; they crazily burned toward Yang Kai’s Divine Sense.

Yang Kai was terrified. He quickly retracted his Divine Sense, but even so he suffered a loss: half of the Divine Sense threads he had extended were burned away.

His face drained of color and his mind reeled with alarm.

His Divine Sense possessed the miraculous Divine Sense Fire and burned with tremendous heat; before discovering this Earth-Lung Fire Pool, even with the Fifth Layer's degree of heat it could not have so swiftly charred his Divine Sense threads. Yet the sparks from this cauldron bore such potency — did that mean they were countless times fiercer than Fifth Layer's flames?

Moreover, those sparks displayed a faint sentience: after forcing back Yang Kai’s Divine Sense threads they shimmered and vanished, as if the whole thing had been an illusion.

Yang Kai naturally knew it wasn’t an illusion — after losing so many threads of Divine Sense that his head felt as if it would split apart, how could it possibly be an illusion?

Before he could puzzle out what was happening, the carved bird on the furnace suddenly sprang to life. Its elegant form flowed free from the cauldron and transformed into a brilliantly red firebird. Savage flames erupted from its body; after a single sweep in the air it launched itself directly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s expression turned ugly as he cried out: “Artifact Spirit!”

He immediately understood why the sparks had seemed intelligent, and why he had just felt watched: this was not a mortal probing him, and that was why he had failed to detect it earlier.

It turned out to be an Artifact Spirit born of the refining furnace. Whether it had existed from the start or had slowly been birthed by tens of thousands of years of Earth-Lung Fire Pool heat, he could not tell.

But once he realized it was the Artifact Spirit of a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure, Yang Kai’s head ached with dread.

He had fought many and seen many treasures of various grades, but never had he encountered such a ferocious spirit within any Secret Treasure.

Artifact Spirits were themselves exceedingly rare.

First, the conditions required for its birth are extremely harsh and demand extraordinary fortune. Second, the process takes an exceedingly long time—any Secret Treasure that has developed an Artifact Spirit must have undergone at least a thousand years, if not far longer, of accumulation.
