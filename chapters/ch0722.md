## Chapter 722 — Shuilan City

Sensing Yang Kai's impatience, Elder Li hurriedly offered a few consoling words.

Yang Kai also knew that brooding now would accomplish nothing; only by finding Meng Wuya and asking him could he learn the precise situation.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai's mood gradually calmed, and in a low voice he asked, "Elder Li, where did you and Zhai Yao encounter them?"

"Shuilan City!"

"Shuilan City?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Yes, it's about a few months' journey from here. But even if you set out now you might not find them. We met them two years ago; at that time Meng Wuya said he would leave Shuilan City before long, and by now he's probably gone." Elder Li spoke with some regret. Judging from Yang Kai's expression and mood, Meng Wuya and that Miss Xia must have been very important to him.

"In any case, it's at least a lead. I've been searching for them for a long time with no clue, so I think I must go take a look," Yang Kai said seriously.

"Very well." Elder Li smiled and inclined his head. "Then let me wish you, young brother, may your hopes be fulfilled."

 "I accept Elder Li's auspicious blessing!" Yang Kai cupped his fist.

After taking his leave of Elder Li and Zhai Yao, Yang Kai hurried back to the inn.

Obtaining such a precious clue from Elder Li this time was an unexpected delight; Yang Kai did not wish to delay. After telling Cang Yan and Fei Yu, he prepared to depart for Shuilan City immediately.

Cang Yan and Fei Yu both knew Yang Kai was searching for his two senior sisters; now that there was a lead, however slim, they did not stop him and even volunteered to escort him.

Yang Kai refused.

He had spent more than a year retrieving the elixir of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower; the four senior uncles were counting on that thing to ascend to the Saint Realm—how could Yang Kai allow himself to delay their great matter?

Yang Kai's stance was resolute. Cang Yan and Fei Yu could only consent, warning him again and again to be careful and to return to the sect to report any grievances if he suffered any while away.

Feeling his senior uncles' concern, Yang Kai's heart warmed.

Yang Kai was experienced in acting alone in the world; for so many years he had essentially been striking out into the world by himself.

After a brief packing, Yang Kai set out at once.

Outside Fuyun City, after seeing him off, Cang Yan and Fei Yu turned away to head to Tianxiao Sect; they too had to return and prepare for their ascension to the Saint Realm.

At the city lord's mansion, Elder Li and Zhai Yao, together with Ao Gu and the others, also said their farewells and set out to roam the world.

Traveling like wind and lightning, Yang Kai was anxious as if his heart were on fire.

Although he knew the chances were slim, he still pressed on with all his effort, hoping only to reach Shuilan City as quickly as possible to see if he could glean any useful clues.

Crossing famous mountains and great rivers, fording streams and brooks, Yang Kai sped like lightning.

Now that his cultivation had reached the Transcendent Realm, his travel speed was much swifter than before; in places where he would not be discovered, Yang Kai even unfurled his Wind-and-Thunder Wings to increase his speed.

The Transcendent Realm was already a respectable state, but on the Tongxuan Continent—where one must transcend to sainthood—it still did not place him above the common world.

Yang Kai estimated that he would need to cultivate at least to the Saint Realm before he could travel here without hindrance.

He had to become strong—stronger and stronger—if he wanted a foothold here. Although he was currently at Tianxiao Sect and the patriarch and his senior uncles treated him well, this was not his true foundation.

What he wanted was power that belonged to himself.

As time passed, Yang Kai's restless mood gradually subsided.

Once calm, Yang Kai felt a sudden clarity; the old perseverance and confidence seemed to return at once. He believed that given enough time he would someday stand at the summit of this world and become a hegemon here.

He had an Indomitable Golden Body and the World-Ending Demon Eye; although these were precious legacies left by the Great Demon God, only Yang Kai could exploit them to their fullest and use them to achieve his mighty ends.

He did not idle while traveling, meditating on the wonders gleaned from the starry sky and absorbing Elder Li's teachings on the use of Divine Sense Fire, integrating them with himself.

That change in confidence and mindset acted like a catalyst, allowing him to gain more and firmer comprehension as he realized new powers.

His newly attained Transcendent Realm consolidated rapidly.

Ahead lay an endless, dense forest; ancient trees towered to the sky, lush green as far as the eye could see, the air fresh and the energy unusually strong. The woods bore abundant traces of demonic beasts and human activity.

Yang Kai sped through without a second thought.

Half a month later, having finally passed through the forest, the instant he crossed a peak that pierced the clouds Yang Kai felt a fresh, natural breath wash over him.

It carried a faint briny tang.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; a familiar sensation rose within him.

Back when he was weak and first left Lingxiao Pavilion to venture out, he had smelled this same air upon arriving at Haicheng City.

Because it was a sea breeze, it carried the salty, fishy scent of seawater.

Looking to the distant horizon, a stretch of azure shimmered with waves; the wind blew from that direction, but the towering mountains beneath him blocked it, so the far side of the range lacked that scent.

"Seaside?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

He had not imagined that Shuilan City would be on the coast; he had departed so hastily before that he hadn't bothered to ask about the city and had come running here on impulse.

Cang Yan and Fei Yu had not warned him either, so now, seeing the vast blue sea, Yang Kai felt as if he had been transported to another life.

It seemed in an instant he had returned to that world of his, standing near Haicheng City once more.

Images of the powerful figures of the overseas isles and of the girl Zhong Miaoke, who kept a peacock, flashed through his mind. Yang Kai chuckled, shook his head to dispel the memories, and quickly flew forward.

The farther he flew, the denser the water energy in the air became; this place was undoubtedly a fine place for water-based cultivators to take root and refine their art.

Three days later, Yang Kai finally arrived at Shuilan City, paid a crystal stone, and entered safely.

Within Shuilan City, a crisp scent permeated the air. Passing cultivators commonly wore pale blue garments, for they cultivated water-style methods and martial skills and were fond of that color.

Here, Yang Kai's True Yang Technique was faintly suppressed, though it did him no real harm.

Practitioners who cultivated yang or fire systems, like him, would not wish to live long-term in such a place; prolonged residence would not only suppress their methods but could even cause their strength to regress.

Although he had long known the odds were slim, shortly after setting foot in Shuilan City Yang Kai still showed a look of disappointment.

He did not release his Divine Sense to probe, yet he could be certain that Meng Wuya was no longer here.

Because Shopkeeper Meng's defensive secret treasure, Heavenly Journey Palace, remained in Yang Kai's possession, he had specifically taken it out of the Black Book Space upon arriving in Shuilan City.

If Meng Wuya were truly in the area, there would surely be some response, for the secret treasure bore an imprint of his soul.

Since no response came, that meant Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang had long since departed.

After a brief dejection, Yang Kai rallied and began to gather information within Shuilan City.

Although Meng Wuya had left, he might have left behind some faint threads that could be pursued.

Now that he had the status of an alchemist and carried an alchemist's token, it was no longer as difficult as before to pry information loose.

He strolled to Shuilan City's Alchemists' Association, presented his alchemist's token, and questioned the alchemists there.

Yang Kai's alchemist's token was the one he had registered back in Giant Stone City and had never changed, so under others' scrutiny he merely appeared as a Lower-Level Spirit-Grade alchemist.

Even so, it surprised Shuilan City's alchemists. The head of the Alchemists' Association here—an Upper-Level Spirit-Grade alchemist well over a hundred years old—gasped in admiration, lamenting how generations produce talent, and received Yang Kai warmly.

One could not deny that with an alchemist's token, travel and inquiries were far more convenient.

Though the world was vast, nearly every city had an Alchemists' Association, unless the city was too small.

Of course, not every association leader was a Saint-Grade alchemist like Elder Du; the leader here was an Upper-Level Spirit-Grade.

In other places, a Middle-Level Spirit-Grade might be sufficient to preside over an Alchemists' Association.

Yang Kai had come partly for the convenience of his alchemist status and partly because Xia Ningshang was also an alchemist and might have had dealings with the local alchemists.

When questioned, everyone shook their heads. Only one person said he seemed to have seen that old-and-young pair, but had never interacted with them, and with two years having passed he had no idea where they had gone.

Helpless, Yang Kai could only thank them and take his leave.

The hard-won clue from Elder Li had ended just like that; Yang Kai couldn't help but give a wry smile.

Though the string of disappointments hit him hard, Yang Kai did not lose heart. He firmly believed that one day he would be reunited with Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, and as for Di Mo—that old bastard—who knew where he might have died.

In the days that followed, Yang Kai kept an eye out for information in Shuilan City and also tried to buy a certain medicinal ingredient.

That herb was also necessary to brew the sacred pill to save the Ancient Demon Clan; it only grew in the sea regions and was exceedingly rare and precious.

Yang Kai thought there might be some here.

Time passed with no harvest; not only did he fail to uncover news of Meng Wuya, the herb was nowhere to be found either. Those he asked all shook their heads, saying the herb had nearly vanished and they had never seen it.

One day a month later, while Yang Kai was questioning things in an apothecary, he suddenly sensed several presences stealthily approaching him.

Frowning, he turned and indeed saw a group of cultivators walking over led by a burly middle-aged man.

Their cultivation wasn't high—basically at the Divine Roaming Realm—but there were many of them and their auras were fierce; they were clearly men who lived on the edge of the blade.

Arriving before Yang Kai, the middle-aged man sized him up from head to foot.

"Business?" Yang Kai asked with some displeasure.
