## Chapter 1084 — Sitting on a Hill Watching Tigers Fight

"Forget it, don't make unnecessary trouble — he doesn't look like he's lying." The yao man called Diji suddenly shook his head, as if worried about something, showing no intention of attacking Yang Kai. He said loudly, "Kid, be sensible. We've been running around here for a long time trying to find some people, but haven't had any luck. Saint Crystals are being consumed fast and there's hardly any left. Give me some Saint Crystals and some recovery Pills and I won't make things hard for you."

Yang Kai frowned; he had expected this group to attack him, but didn't expect the situation to take a turn.

He nodded slightly and replied readily, "Fine!"

Saying that, the Spatial Ring in his hand flashed with brilliant light, and over a thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals shot out and flew toward them like a falling sky.

When that group saw the Saint Crystals come, their eyes reddened; they scrambled to grab them in chaos, each returning with their hands full, grinning from ear to ear.

They must really have been wandering in the Star Domain for a long time; otherwise, given their strength, they wouldn't be so delighted just from getting some Saint Crystals.

Yang Kai couldn't help recalling the He sisters from the Sword Alliance — He Zao and He Miao — who, in the Chaos Abyss, had to hole up in a cave after running out of Saint Crystals and recovery Pills to escape the ravages of the Starry Sky. If Yang Kai hadn't helped them, those two sisters would likely have died long ago.

After spending so long in the Starry Sky, Saint Crystals and recovery Pills are a matter of life and death.

Seeing Yang Kai casually throw away a thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals without batting an eye, Diji couldn't help showing surprise; he hadn't expected the youth to be so wealthy.

Being able to toss out a thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals meant there were even more in his Spatial Ring; for a moment, Diji was tempted.

Not only him, but the martial artists who had grabbed Yang Kai's Saint Crystals were also filled with greed, staring fixedly at the ring in Yang Kai's hand, eager to rush forward and snatch the Spatial Ring.

A few people had already shifted their positions quietly, suppressing their strength and waiting for Diji's order to take Yang Kai's life.

The woman who had been speaking earlier watched Diji, her beautiful eyes flashing with light, seeking his opinion.

A flash of struggle passed through Diji's eyes; he suddenly grinned and said to Yang Kai, "Kid, you're sensible. We'll spare you this time — let's go!"

The group reluctantly trailed behind Diji; many didn't understand why he let such a fat lamb go — young, low in strength, with so many Saint Crystals — there was no reason to let him off.

But when Diji spoke, they didn't argue, only sighed repeatedly.

The group moved farther until Yang Kai was out of sight, then the woman said, "Diji, this isn't like you. What's troubling you?"

Diji snorted, looked back, and saw everyone staring at him, apparently demanding an explanation. He couldn't help shouting, "I've seen many with guts, but that kid's not just brave. Are you all blind? Haven't you noticed he's not afraid of us at all? He's only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm. Why isn't he afraid? In this vast Star Domain he's alone. If we kill him, no one will know. Why the hell isn't he afraid of us?"

Someone thought for a moment and muttered, "Could he have other elders lying in wait?"

"Idiot, you should already be dead then!" Diji roared in anger. "It's a wonder you're still alive."

The man who'd been insulted flushed and dared not retort, muttering something none could make out.

The woman pondered, "You don't mean to imply that the kid is reckless because he relies on someone behind him and isn't afraid we'll strike, do you?"

Diji nodded: "That's probably it."

"How could that be? He's only Third Stage of the Saint Realm. There are so many of us — even if we truly attacked, could he slaughter us all?" the woman shouted in disbelief.

"He couldn't kill us, but we probably couldn't kill him either. That kid must have a powerful backer, perhaps a Secret Treasure given by his elder. Once we move, he'll use the treasure's power to escape. Then we get no benefit and only bring shame upon ourselves. If his elder comes looking, who can handle it?"

Hearing Diji's words, the woman and others looked thoughtful; the more they considered it, the more sense Diji's argument made. Without some backing, how could a young Third Stage Saint stand indifferent when facing so many superior opponents?

"Then you still dare to demand his Saint Crystals?" The woman, having understood, broke into a cold sweat. "Wouldn't that just make him our enemy?"

"Not that serious," Diji waved his hand. "It's only a few Saint Crystals. If he truly has an elder to shelter him, he won't care. He probably understood I'm letting him a way out. Otherwise, after all our posturing he'd have us looking ridiculous for retreating empty-handed. Didn't you see how readily he tossed the Saint Crystals over? That kid's sharp — good at handling matters. Damn, kids these days are so troublesome. Aren't they going to leave us any space to live?"

The woman pursed her lips and smiled, fingering the Saint Crystal in her hand; noticing they were all Upper-Level, she immediately believed Diji's words.

A Third Stage of the Saint Realm youth having such wealth must have received gifts from his elders.

"Forget that kid. The people we're after must be hiding nearby. You take some and split up to search; report back if you find anything. The sooner we're done the sooner we leave. I've drifted here for half a year; I don't want to stay any longer!"

"Fine." The woman agreed, selecting half the team to split off and search with Diji.

On his Star Shuttle, Yang Kai remained at ease; the earlier episode had no effect on him.

As his understanding of spatial power deepened, his ability to flee improved. Unless he encountered experts of the Origin Returning Realm, he felt no fear. At worst, he'd tear open space and flee — no one would dare follow into the spatial turbulence.

Still, if a thousand Saint Crystals could spare trouble, he was more than happy to give them.

Time passed and he continued toward his destination.

One day he plunged into a vast Meteorite Sea; looking out, countless meteorites filled the view — some as huge as mountains, others as small as plates — countless stones forming a vast ocean.

There are many such Meteorite Seas in the Starry Sky, stretching across the heavens. Some are so dense that even piloting a Star Shuttle through them takes months; they drift with the currents and follow no set pattern.

When warships navigate, they avoid the Meteorite Seas because the stones not only slow travel but also create great danger; one misstep could mean shipwreck and death.

Excellent cartographers carve suitable route maps according to a ship's destination so vessels can travel through safer areas.

Here, Yang Kai couldn't have the Star Shuttle pilot itself — one mistake would send it smashing into an oncoming meteor. He had to temporarily set aside other matters and concentrate on piloting.

Weaving through the dense meteorites, after a dozen days he reached the heart of the Meteorite Sea; ahead lay endless stones with no visible end.

Yang Kai wasn't in a hurry; he had nothing pressing to rush toward.

In the dark Meteorite Sea, pinpricks of light suddenly bloomed ahead. Yang Kai frowned and released his Divine Sense to probe toward them.

Waves of strong and weak life fluctuations came from that direction, along with sounds of fierce fighting.

People in such a place?

Yang Kai found it strange — from the situation ahead it seemed a dispute had erupted and a desperate struggle was underway.

He couldn't help but recall the group he'd met some days before.

Could it be such a coincidence? Yang Kai had wandered the Starry Sky for half a year and hadn't seen a single person; encountering them again now likely meant it was the same group.

Last time their words had indicated they were chasing their enemy; judging by the current scene, they must have caught up.

Yang Kai slipped over quietly, hiding his aura, and soon arrived behind a huge meteorite. From there he peered at the scene and found his guess was correct.

On the battlefield stood the group led by Diji, nearly twenty strong originally but now less than half remained; the rest were missing. Judging by the nearby bloodstains and chopped limbs on the meteorites, the vanished half likely met a grim fate.

The opponents fighting Diji's group were in no better shape; each exerted their full strength, gasping for breath, with various exquisite powers and Secret Treasures releasing light. Many cursed while they fought.

The fighting on both sides was fierce and merciless; people were continually wounded and killed.

Yang Kai hid to the side, unnoticed; the souls of those who died were swept by an invisible pulling force and all were absorbed into his Sea of Consciousness.

These were Saint King Realm experts; their souls greatly aided Yang Kai's advancement and his comprehension of the Dao of Martial Arts. Pleased, Yang Kai crept toward the center of the battlefield to receive the soul energy of the fallen.

Diji and his group were not good people — Yang Kai had seen enough from their earlier attitude toward him. If they died, he felt no pity.

He didn't know any of the people fighting Diji, so there was no reason for him to step in on their behalf.

Yang Kai enjoyed sitting on the hill watching tigers fight and reaping the fisherman's profit.

Neither side knew how long they'd been battling; judging by their exhaustion, at least a day or two had passed, and the battlefield drifted as the Meteorite Sea moved.

Yang Kai had been trailing them, silently praying the remaining people would die soon and move on to the next life.

As time went on fewer and fewer remained alive; on either side only a handful were left, and even Saint King Realm Third Stage experts could not escape the summons of death.

Yang Kai keenly noticed that among them one man, even when seeing his comrades fall, remained indifferent, only darting among meteorites and carefully inspecting each one, as if searching for something.
