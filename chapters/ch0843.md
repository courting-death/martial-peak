## Chapter 843 — Does This as Soon as He Returns

Yang Kai raced onward, as swift as wind and lightning.

He crossed famous mountains and great rivers, his mood placid and untroubled.

He had originally planned to go straight to the Ice Sect to find Su Yan and bring her back to Dragon-Phoenix Palace to inherit the Phoenix Empress’s legacy. But he didn’t know what condition Su Yan was in now; if she were still in seclusion and he went blindly, he might find nothing and only waste time.

Besides, he hadn’t returned to Tianxiao Sect in several years. Ever since parting with his senior aunt and uncles at Fuyun City, five or six years had already passed.

Yang Kai felt he should first return to Tianxiao Sect to let those senior uncles and aunts and his sect’s ancestor, Chu Lingxiao, know he was safe.

He had been on the Tongxuan Continent for some years, but Yang Kai still felt little attachment or belonging here. Even Tianxiao Sect felt to him only like the place where the Lingxiao Pavilion’s founding ancestor resided.

The senior uncles and aunts had treated him well, but no matter what, Yang Kai found it hard to develop the kind of dependence and intimacy toward Tianxiao Sect that he had for Lingxiao Pavilion.

To this world, he was, at best, a passerby.

Zhongdu and Lingxiao Pavilion were his roots.

He had no idea what things were like over there now; familiar faces flashed before his eyes as he sped home, memories keeping pace with his flight.

When he left Zhongdu back then, he had told those people that, once the time was right, he would bring them over. Now, thinking back, that promise seemed irresponsible—he didn’t even know how to return to Zhongdu.

Although he could now tear space, it was only enough for short instantaneous travel of a few hundred miles; after using it two or three times, his Divine Sense would be drained.

Such a method could only be used in the most urgent hours, or when one could recover leisurely without danger.

As he pondered, Yang Kai suddenly brightened—he remembered that Chu Lingxiao had been to Zhongdu, and the Water Divine Hall’s Shui Ling had also gone from the Tongxuan Continent; if he could learn how those two had traveled, he might be able to borrow their method.

Before that, though, he had to raise his own strength and build his own retinue; the power he controlled had to be in his own hands.

Otherwise, even if he managed to bring those people over, he couldn’t guarantee their safety.

The Ancient Demon Clan would be a fine force to have.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land would do as well. As for Dragon-Phoenix Palace… Yang Kai would not consider that for now; he had to find Su Yan first.

The most important thing was to find land large enough to house so many people.

Time slipped by unnoticed as Yang Kai sped tens of thousands of li; now he spread his Wind-and-Thunder Wings and, aided by the Nine Heavens Divine Technique’s Fleeting Heaven Shadow, he moved like thunder and lightning.

En route he descended into towns a few times to ask for directions. After about half a month, Yang Kai at last saw the endless towering snow-capped mountains in the distance and felt a faint chill sweep over him.

He was almost there.

Tianxiao Sect lay just a thousand li beyond those peaks.

Two days later, Yang Kai finally returned to Tianxiao Sect.

In the valley wrapped by hundreds of peaks there were many traces of martial activity. Yang Kai grinned and flew straight for one of the summits.

He landed lightly by a cave entrance on the mountainside.

Qixiu Peak.

The peak where Senior Aunt Fei Yu had her own place—also the spot where Yang Kai had stayed before.

Entering the cave, its inner passages twisted and turned. Before he had gone far, Yang Kai smelled a strong scent of wine.

His face darkened; Fei Yu was as usual—addicted to drink. With such a rich aroma, he wondered how much she had consumed.

When he reached the inner chamber, a soft hissing sound greeted him and a water curtain surged forth. The curtain carried a heavy wine scent; Yang Kai inhaled and suddenly felt dizzy and light-headed, as if his body lost weight.

He hastily circulated True Yuan to dispel the intoxicated state.

Beyond the water curtain a slender, jade-like hand reached out and accurately seized Yang Kai’s shoulder.

Yang Kai did not resist; he allowed that fair, jade-like hand to press him, swept the water curtain aside, and smilingly looked ahead to greet, “Senior Aunt!”

Hearing his voice, the person behind the water curtain seemed startled and loosened the grip on his shoulder.

Their eyes met; in those beautiful eyes bloomed intense joy, and a tipsy flush added a unique radiance to the face.

Yang Kai’s smile froze; he involuntarily averted his gaze.

He saw that the plump, full-figured Fei Yu was bathing and had been startled by his arrival. She wore only a thin bathrobe, holding it up with one hand to keep it from slipping, while her other hand kept a firm hold on him.

Two long, fair breasts were bared to the air, an astonishing patch of snow-white skin and a deep cleft at the chest, her hair wet and draped over fragrant shoulders, her bearing extraordinary.

For a moment Yang Kai thought he had seen two delicate, grape-like mounds pressing against the lower edge of the robe.

He had come at a bad time; Yang Kai’s face flushed with embarrassment.

Qixiu Peak was seldom visited except by Cang Yan and his circle; when they did come they would always announce themselves to Fei Yu, unlike Yang Kai who had barged in unannounced.

“I wondered who it was—turns out it’s you, little brat!” Fei Yu chuckled, not letting go but instead dragging him into her embrace and pressing his neck. She laughed coquettishly, “Little junior nephew, you didn’t come back for years and you return and do this—surely that’s not proper?”

A remarkable elasticity pressed into his back; Yang Kai felt something pushing at his shoulder blades and quickly patted Fei Yu’s arm, “Senior Aunt, could you let go first and then we talk?”

“If Senior Aunt isn’t afraid, why should you be? Afraid I’ll eat you?” Fei Yu teased, not letting go of Yang Kai; if anything she tightened her grip, squeezing him a little out of shape and breathing a fragrant whisper into his ear.

“Senior Aunt’s joking…” A faint, tingling warmth spread at his ear; his body involuntarily reacted despite himself.

Sensing this, Fei Yu snorted softly and quickly released him, eyes glaring as she bared her small teeth, “You little bastard, gone wild out there? Finally remembered to come back?”

Yang Kai hurriedly sat down on the stone bench beside him, poured himself a cup of water, and drank with feigned composure, his eyes fixed straight ahead. “Senior Aunt, could you put some clothes on first and then we talk? You doing this makes me very uncomfortable.”

“Little pervert! You even have a reaction to your Senior Aunt?” Fei Yu’s face went red as she scolded and feigned anger, “Sit there and don’t move; I’ll deal with you later. If you dare run off again, I’ll chase you to the ends of the world and beat you up!”

With that, her lithe form swayed and she vanished from sight.

Yang Kai breathed out inwardly, feeling overwhelmed.

This Senior Aunt was really not acting like a proper Senior Aunt at all.

After waiting a while, Fei Yu emerged fully dressed, her beautiful eyes bright as she sat opposite Yang Kai and looked at him with warm fondness.

“Heh heh, Senior Aunt, years without seeing you and you shine even more—just now I didn’t look properly, but now I see you seem much younger, like an eighteen-year-old girl, so graceful!”

“You little rascal, don’t flatter—don’t think words like that please me!” Fei Yu laughed and scolded him; the anger she had harbored for years all melted away.

These years she had been trying to find news of Yang Kai but could learn nothing; she naturally worried. After all, Yang Kai came from a poor backwater and his strength had not been high—when he went to Fuyun City he had only been at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm.

How could Fei Yu not worry?

Not only she; the other three senior uncles and aunts were also extremely anxious.

Each of them vowed inwardly that if Yang Kai returned safely, they would give him a hard time.

But upon seeing him, Fei Yu could not stay angry; she felt a great stone drop from her heart and breathed easier.

After a moment, Fei Yu’s expression suddenly grew serious. She swept her Divine Sense over Yang Kai; a strange light flashed in her eyes and she covered her mouth in surprise, exclaiming, “Little junior nephew, what cultivation level are you at now?”

She had detected it but found it hard to believe.

“Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!”

“Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm?” Fei Yu sprang up and was instantly at Yang Kai’s side. Without ceremony she took his hand, her delicate fingers tracing as she circulated True Yuan through his body to probe carefully.

While probing she anxiously asked, “You didn’t cultivate any rushed, shortcut method, did you?”

Yang Kai laughed in surprise, “No. And even if such methods existed, they only worked at the very beginning. Once you’ve reached the Transcendent Realm, there’s no way a quick method could still produce such results.”

Hearing him, Fei Yu nodded slightly in agreement.

Shortcut methods did exist; many cultivators blinded by power chose them and would grow faster early on, but later would falter or even stall, a great hidden danger.

Before the Transcendent Realm, with sufficient talent and the resources and techniques of the forces on the Tongxuan Continent, cultivation was not particularly difficult; for instance, Shui Ling had reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm before she was twenty.

Such cultivation at that age in Zhongdu would have been monstrous—Yang Kai had been awed when he first heard of it.

But on the Tongxuan Continent it was normal.

After reaching the Transcendent Realm, however, advancement was no longer easy. Each Stage’s promotion came with immense difficulty; some spent decades or centuries, even a lifetime, merely to make a small step.

Fei Yu herself had decent talent, but from the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm to the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm had taken her sixty or seventy years; at the Third Stage she then lingered for another thirty or forty years.

By strict reckoning, Fei Yu was already over a hundred years old.

But her strong cultivation and skill at preserving her looks meant she still appeared like a young maiden, both in appearance and temperament.

When Yang Kai had gone to Fuyun City he had only been at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. Now, in just five or six years, he had reached the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

Such growth was terrifying.

Fei Yu could not help but worry that he might have relied on some crooked or dangerous path.
