## Chapter 1125 — About to Break Through

"You're a formation master?" Wu Yi paused for a moment, staring at Yang Yan in astonishment. Although she knew Yang Yan had been setting the array earlier, she never imagined the casually deployed formation would be so formidable; such mastery was unheard of to Wu Yi.

Yu Feng looked at Yang Yan with an expression of outright worship.

Elsewhere, Xu Zhishen, who had summoned four mountain peaks, suddenly looked somewhat decrepit, but seeing the space that had been blasted nearly to collapse, he couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.

In all his years he had never encountered anyone like Yang Kai; he couldn't even understand how Yang Kai had avoided the first strike—there were no traces of rapid movement, as if he had ignored the existence of space and simply arrived from one place to another.

Even if he were that formidable, he should have been beyond recognition now. Xu Zhishen, exhausted in body and mind, laughed heartily; he had fought with all his strength and at least had not disgraced the Xu Family's name.

Suddenly, an uncanny sense of crisis rose in his chest. Xu Zhishen, seasoned in battle, reacted without thinking: he hurriedly drove the phantasms of the four peaks to strike at the source of the danger while turning his head to look.

At a glance, Xu Zhishen almost cried out in alarm.

The youth he had thought surely doomed was, at this moment, completely unharmed; on the great sword in his hand, roiling with Demonic Flame, a tremendous sword radiance erupted like a thorn of lightning, bearing the aura of total destruction as it slashed in their direction.

Xu Zhishen shuddered, nearly swallowing his tongue.

Boom! Boom! Boom...

The massive, pitch-black sword light struck squarely against the phantom of the mountain and was blocked outside, yet the overflowing aura—cold and scorching, righteous and wicked intertwined—carried a contradictory profound intent that made Xu Zhishen’s hands and feet go cold.

He was certain that if he were scorched by that black flame he would be unable to dispel it and would ultimately be burned to charcoal! What kind of freak was this?

Not only was Xu Zhishen filled with shock and fury, the warriors of the Xu Family and the Haike Family all cried out in astonishment; even Ba Qingyan's gaze was bewildered.

With his eyesight he still couldn't make out how Yang Kai had evaded the four-peak intercept.

Even he himself, had he not prepared to flee in advance, could not have emerged unscathed under such might, yet this youth had done so. Ba Qingyan was horrified to find he had underestimated the youth's strength time and again. He was simply not a man, but a complete monster!

Xu Zhishen roared; the four peaks first summoned surrounded him, forming an impregnable defensive bulwark.

He was truly afraid; a deep-seated terror kept him from exposing himself before Yang Kai. He feared that a single misstep would cost him his life.

A Divine Sense attack, subtly containing spatial intricacies, erupted together with Saint Yuan, and Yang Kai's assault poured toward Xu Zhishen. To his surprise, the four peaks not only guarded the old curmudgeon tightly, they even sealed off that patch of space—his attack could not penetrate to harm him.

The fifth and sixth peaks drifted out from the Hundred Mountains Painting, more magnificent than the previous four. Xu Zhishen bit his tongue, spitting blood onto the painting; his flagging momentum surged wildly and his once-dim, fearful eyes turned ferocious. He drove the two peaks, continuously smashing them down to bombard Yang Kai.

Dragon Lair Mountain trembled violently; deep pits appeared one after another in the earth. Ravines spread out in all directions.

Yang Kai exploded with rage: "Old dog, don't ruin my turf!"

If Xu Zhishen continued to entangle him like this, the entire Dragon Lair Mountain would be ruined; should the ground collapse, the Ethereal Crystal veins hidden beneath might be exposed.

Killing intent surged in Yang Kai like a tide.

He unleashed wave after wave of burning Demonic Flame that swirled around Xu Zhishen, and strangely the flames did not dissipate; instead, as more flames were added, they coalesced until, in a short time, they formed a black, burning cloud.

The fire-cloud wrapped Xu Zhishen and the four peaks guarding him, constantly scorching and refining them, while Yang Kai continuously poured more Demonic Flame into the cloud to increase its power.

"No... no..." Xu Zhishen cried in terror as the phantasms of the four peaks around him grew dimmer under the scorching of the fire-cloud, seeming on the verge of vanishing.

If those four phantasms disappeared, it would be Xu Zhishen's death knell.

"What are you standing there for? Hurry up and kill this little bastard!" Xu Zhishen shouted to the distant Xu Family Saint King Realm warriors watching.

He had fought Yang Kai alone to display his strength and uphold his elder's dignity, but never expected to be outmatched; facing death, he could no longer afford pride and had to plead to his clan's warriors for aid.

Far off, among the Saint King Realm warriors who had followed Xu Zhishen, only two rushed over without hesitation when they heard the shout; the others hesitated, shrinking back, some even discreetly taking a few steps away.

Even with something like the Hundred Mountains Painting drawn out, Xu Zhishen was still no match for Yang Kai—who would dare come forward to die?

The two who charged in hadn't grasped the situation when two balls of Demonic Flame slammed at them; they foolishly tried to block them, but in the blink of an eye were wrapped in flame that could not be extinguished. They tumbled on the ground before getting close and lay motionless.

Seeing this, the remaining Xu Family Saint King Realm fighters could no longer contain their terror and turned to flee; one even shouted, "Elder, hold on! I'll go fetch reinforcements from the clan!"

Hearing that, Xu Zhishen's breath grew ragged and blood spat from his mouth; his already flagging look faded completely.

He looked at Ba Qingyan and, with all his strength, hoarsely shouted, "Brother Ba, if you help me out today, Xu will gladly hand over the Hundred Mountains Painting!"

Ba Qingyan's eyelids narrowed; an expression of temptation immediately crossed his face.

He had long heard of the Xu Family's Hundred Mountains Painting, and today he had witnessed the overwhelming power of this Origin-Grade treasure; he believed that if he could obtain it he would surely become the Haike Family's foremost expert—perhaps even worthy to contest ordinary Origin Returning Realm masters.

But the youth was clearly not someone to be trifled with; from the start of the fight Ba Qingyan had failed to see his limits. For a moment his mind waged war and he hesitated.

"Brother Ba!" Xu Zhishen hoarsely shouted again; he was at the end of his tether and could hardly hold on.

Ba Qingyan's hesitation suddenly hardened and he was about to step forward when Yang Kai coldly glanced at him and said, "If you dare come up, don't think I'll refrain from slaughtering you just because you're Wu Yi's clansmen!"

Ba Qingyan froze on the spot; a chill ran from head to heel.

At that moment, accompanied by Xu Zhishen's shriek, the phantasms of the four peaks that had wrapped him finally vanished; the black fire-cloud rolled in and burned him to ash.

Aside from his Spatial Ring, only the Hundred Mountains Painting drifted down from the air.

Countless greedy gazes instantly fixed upon the Hundred Mountains Painting.

Yang Kai stood where he was with a strange expression, not reaching out to take it; yet his aura showed no sign of waning—if anything it grew stronger and more ferocious.

Yang Yan hurried over with small quick steps, holding her wide black robe with both hands; she scooped up the fallen Hundred Mountains Painting and Xu Zhishen's Spatial Ring, then hurried back to stand within the formation she'd set.

"Ah..." Ba Qingyan sighed leisurely; he had never summoned the courage to snatch the mouth-watering Hundred Mountains Painting and felt a wave of disappointment.

Dragon Lair Mountain—deathly silent.

The Haike Family fighters looked at one another, silent; in no way had they expected such an outcome. Xu Family's people had come on the warpath, even bringing out the Hundred Mountains Painting, yet they were slain by a Third Stage Saint Realm cultivator—even an elder like Xu Zhishen had perished.

If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn't have believed it.

Wu Yi and Yu Feng were likewise immersed in immense shock and remained speechless for a long time.

They had heard of those so-called genius practitioners: Yingyue Hall's younger generation had a few who could fight above their grade; they were the elite of the young, admired and worshipped by peers, famed far and wide.

But those so-called prodigies, plastered in halos of praise, were not even worth dogshit compared to Yang Kai.

This time Yang Kai had leaped an entire major realm in combat, and in the end he won—completely unscathed.

Could it be that the one they'd brought back was a genius among geniuses? Both Wu Yi and Yu Feng couldn't help thinking so; their family sorrow was washed away by this shock.

"Eh..." Yang Yan was fingering the Hundred Mountains Painting when she suddenly looked at Yang Kai and let out a light sound; thoughtful, a gleam of delight bloomed in her beautiful eyes. Carrying her black robe, she ran to Yang Kai again and began taking items from her Spatial Ring to quickly arrange an array around him.

When she returned, Wu Yi curiously asked, "What's wrong with Yang Kai?"

"It looks like he's about to break through."

"Ah?" Wu Yi cried in surprise.

Yu Feng wore a dumbfounded expression—both envious and ashamed. After such a battle, Yang Kai was about to break through: he was currently at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; once he broke through he'd reach the Saint King Realm, the same realm as he and Wu Yi. Any remaining sense of superiority vanished, but thinking of Yang Kai's terrifying combat power put his mind at ease.

For someone like him, breaking through at this moment was not surprising.

If Yang Yan could detect it, Ba Qingyan certainly could; from afar he stared deeply at Yang Kai, his face flickering through fear, worry, astonishment, and shock in succession.

A pale, beardless middle-aged man nearby quietly approached and said in a low voice, "Elder Ba, this kid seems about to break through; should we..."
