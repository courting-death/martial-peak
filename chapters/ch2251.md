## Chapter 2251 — Bullying the Weak with Strength

Qin Chaoyang of the Qin Family hurried anxiously into a courtyard. As he swept his gaze inside, his expression immediately darkened.

He saw that quite a few people had gathered in the courtyard. Some were disciples of the Eight Directions Sect who resided with the Qin Family, while the others were the Qin Family’s guards and servants.

Although there weren’t many from the Eight Directions Sect, each one possessed the cultivation of the Dao Origin Realm. The Qin Family’s guards, though they surrounded them layer upon layer, were all only at the Void King Realm or Origin Returning Realm.

Despite the guards' numbers, the disciples' aura was utterly incomparable.

The atmosphere at the scene was heavy, and a faint scent of blood lingered in the air.

Qin Chaoyang’s heavy, hurried footsteps startled everyone. The many guards turned to look, and upon seeing him arrive, they all called out softly, “Patriarch!”

The disciples of the Eight Directions Sect, surrounded in the center, looked rather uneasy.

Qin Chaoyang nodded lightly and walked straight forward.

The crowd parted of their own accord, allowing him to pass unimpeded.

When he reached the center, Qin Chaoyang glanced at the ground, and his eyes instantly narrowed, a trace of anger rising in his heart.

On the ground lay the corpse of a maid, blood pooling everywhere, her death tragic. Qin Chaoyang recognized her at a glance—just a few days ago, she had brought him tea, and now she lay dead here, her beautiful eyes wide open, unable to rest in peace.

Judging by the cause of death, it seemed she had been struck in the chest with tremendous force, her entire chest caved in. Even the vomit at the corner of her mouth contained fragments of her internal organs.

Witnessing this tragic scene, Qin Chaoyang’s emotions surged, and even his Origin Qi trembled slightly.

The disciples of the Eight Directions Sect glanced at each other, all looking awkward. Among them, a fair-skinned, handsome young man stood out especially.

“Who did this?” After a long silence, Qin Chaoyang finally took a deep breath. Though his tone was calm, the slight tremor in his voice revealed his inner turmoil.

As he spoke, he raised his eyes and swept his gaze over the disciples of the Eight Directions Sect.

All of them averted their eyes, not daring to meet his gaze.

“If anyone knows what happened, step forward and speak up. Don’t be afraid!” Qin Chaoyang called out in a low voice, his gaze sweeping over his own guards and maids.

One of the maids bit her red lip and stepped forward, her face pale, seemingly still in shock, her eyes swollen from crying. Suppressing her sobs, she knelt before Qin Chaoyang with a thud and said, “Patriarch, Xiaohuan cannot rest in peace. Please seek justice for her!”

“Stand up and tell me what happened.” Qin Chaoyang bent down and helped the maid to her feet.

After rising, the maid glanced at one of the Eight Directions Sect disciples. That person was glaring at her viciously, frightening her so much that her face paled and she let out a scream.

Qin Chaoyang naturally noticed this. He placed his hand on the maid’s shoulder, sending a surge of pure Origin Qi to calm her fear, and said gently, “Patriarch is here. No one can bully you. Just tell the truth.”

“Yes!” The maid nodded lightly. Her red lips parted as she said, “This servant and Xiaohuan were ordered by Patriarch to take care of the honored guests’ daily needs. We did our duty and never dared slack off. Today, the two of us came here together to deliver some food to one of the honored guests. After setting down the fruit plate, we were about to leave, but unexpectedly... unexpectedly...”

At this point, she seemed to recall something terrifying. Her delicate body trembled, and she could not go on.

Qin Chaoyang waited patiently, continuing to support her with Origin Qi.

After a while, the maid gradually calmed down and said, “Unexpectedly, that honored guest harbored evil intentions and tried to force Xiaohuan and me to stay and serve him. Of course, we refused and tried everything to avoid it. I don’t know what happened, but suddenly Xiaohuan screamed and was sent flying out of the side room. When I went to check, she... she...”

Hearing this, Qin Chaoyang’s grip tightened slightly, and the maid fainted. He turned to a nearby guard and said, “Take her away and let her rest.”

“Yes!” The guard responded at once, picked up the maid, and hurried out of the courtyard.

Only then did Qin Chaoyang turn to look at a certain side room in the courtyard. The door was already shattered, clearly broken by something. Judging from the maid’s earlier words, it must have been destroyed when Xiaohuan was struck out of the room.

“Who is staying in that room?” Qin Chaoyang pointed at the scene of the incident, his gaze sharp as he looked at the Eight Directions Sect disciples.

The group all avoided his gaze, their eyes flickering, clearly feeling guilty and embarrassed.

But one of them, ashamed and angry, puffed out his chest and shouted, “I’m staying there. So what?”

As soon as he spoke, all the Qin Family guards locked their gaze on him, as did Qin Chaoyang.

This was the fair-skinned, handsome disciple of the Eight Directions Sect.

Under everyone’s gaze, he showed no sign of guilt. He sneered, “What do you want? Before you try anything, you’d better consider your own abilities!”

As he spoke, he roused his Origin Qi, and in an instant his cultivation at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was on full display.

The pressure forced Qin Chaoyang to take several steps back, and the guards fared even worse. Each felt as if a mountain pressed down on them, their faces strained, and their bones creaked.

Though suppressed by the other’s aura, Qin Chaoyang did not shrink back. Instead, he summoned his strength and forced himself to stand firm. He said in a deep voice, “What? Are you planning to destroy my Qin Family?”

“That’s not what I mean. Don’t twist my words!” the fair-skinned man retorted.

“Was it you who killed Xiaohuan?” Qin Chaoyang asked through gritted teeth.

The fair-skinned man’s face turned awkward. He mumbled, “I didn’t want to. It wasn’t on purpose. She bit me, and I got angry and lost control. Look, she bit me pretty hard!”

As he spoke, he rolled up his sleeve, revealing a row of neat bite marks on his arm.

“Just for that, you killed her?” Qin Chaoyang suddenly stepped forward, his clothes fluttering without wind.

Although his cultivation was higher than Qin Chaoyang’s, seeing the latter’s furious appearance, the fair-skinned man’s aura diminished, and he retreated slightly, arguing, “I said it wasn’t on purpose! What more do you want? You’re a cultivator too—you know sometimes accidents happen.”

“I am a cultivator, but I would never force an ordinary person to do something against their will, let alone kill someone by accident!” Qin Chaoyang roared.

“You old bastard...” The fair-skinned man was also enraged. “There’s no reasoning with you.”

“Heh...” At this moment, another middle-aged man stepped out, chuckled, and cupped his fists to Qin Chaoyang. “Patriarch Qin, may I have a word with you in private?”

“If you have something to say, say it here.” Qin Chaoyang replied coldly.

Rebuffed, the middle-aged man looked embarrassed and cursed Qin Chaoyang inwardly for being so tactless. But he couldn’t press too hard, so after a moment’s thought, he said, “Patriarch Qin, my Junior Brother Lin Yun killed your family’s maid by accident. He is at fault, but he is now full of remorse. Please, Patriarch Qin, be magnanimous and let this matter be settled quietly.”

“Full of remorse?” Qin Chaoyang cast a sidelong glance at Lin Yun, sneering coldly. “Am I blind? I don’t see even a shred of regret on his face.”

The middle-aged man immediately shot Lin Yun a look. Lin Yun muttered a few words in dissatisfaction, then quickly lowered his head, looking listless.

“Patriarch Qin, the dead cannot return. You can’t possibly want my Junior Brother Lin Yun to pay with his life, can you?” the middle-aged man said with a smile.

“He wouldn’t dare!” Lin Yun suddenly looked up and sneered.

“Shut up!” the middle-aged man snapped at Lin Yun, finally making him behave.

The middle-aged man turned back to Qin Chaoyang and said in a low voice, “Patriarch Qin, to be honest, my Junior Brother Lin isn’t usually an arrogant or domineering person. He’s just a bit obsessed with women. Today’s incident probably happened because of that. He’s been here for a while and has always behaved himself. Who knew he’d lose control today? Even in the Sect, the Vice Sect Master spoils him, and we can’t do anything about his temper. Patriarch Qin, please don’t take it to heart.”

“Vice Sect Master?” Qin Chaoyang’s eyes narrowed.

“Oh, right. Vice Sect Master Lin Rui is his uncle,” the middle-aged man explained with a smile.

Qin Chaoyang could hear the underlying threat in his words.

Even without a backer, Lin Yun's Second Stage Dao Origin cultivation alone meant no one in the Qin Family could restrain him. Now, with this added concern, Qin Chaoyang knew that making him pay with his life was utterly impossible.

The Qin Family simply could not afford to provoke the Eight Directions Sect. Although the latter wasn’t a great Sect, it was still hundreds of times stronger than the Qin Family.

Thinking of this, Qin Chaoyang couldn’t help but feel disheartened, his expression bleak.

A family maid had been beaten to death in his own home, yet as the Patriarch, he couldn’t punish the culprit. This left him deeply unsettled.

"Why so much nonsense?" Lin Yun seemed extremely impatient and shouted, "It’s just a maid. Would a hundred thousand Source Crystals be enough? If not, I’ll give you two hundred thousand! For a small family like yours, two hundred thousand is a huge sum—enough for you to live off for years. Don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!"

He looked utterly contemptuous, showing not a trace of remorse, as if the maid on the ground hadn’t been killed by him at all.

The middle-aged man didn’t try to stop him at all, clearly sharing the same view. If money could settle things, that would be best. If not, he didn’t mind tearing off the mask and resorting to threats. In any case, today’s events must never be spread.

Hearing this, Qin Chaoyang’s previously dejected expression suddenly turned to rage.

The middle-aged man quickly tried to soothe him, “Patriarch Qin, please calm down. My Junior Brother Lin Yun’s words may be unpleasant, but his suggestion is not without merit. Name your price, and we won’t refuse.”
