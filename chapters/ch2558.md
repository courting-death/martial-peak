## Chapter 2558 — Life Is Hard

Youhun roared angrily, "Duan Hongchen, enough is enough!"

This was no longer about respecting that brat, but about disrespecting himself. How could Youhun not be furious?

Duan Hongchen replied calmly, "He is proficient in the Power of Space!"

"Is that so?" Youhun was slightly surprised. Since Duan Hongchen said that brat was proficient in the Power of Space, then he truly was. Such a person was not easy to kill.

"He also learned the Years Like a Shuttle Seal!"

"What? Years Like a Shuttle!" This time, Youhun was truly shocked. Years Like a Shuttle was the Great Emperor of Time's divine ability, the only divine ability in the world involving the Laws of Time. Even Youhun could not grasp its mysteries. Once the Years Like a Shuttle Seal was unleashed, he might even have to bury his own daughter with him.

"Oh, and the Mountain and River Bell is also in his possession!" Duan Hongchen kept tossing out bits of information, each one striking Youhun like a heavy blow, making his expression more and more exaggerated. Secretly glancing over, Duan Hongchen felt immensely satisfied.

Who knew how he learned all this? After all, back in the Shattered Star Sea, Yang Kai never revealed so many secrets.

Great Emperor Youhun was already stunned, his mouth twitching uncontrollably.

After a long while, he finally said in a deep voice, "Origin Cauldron's Mountain and River Bell?"

Duan Hongchen raised his brows, "Besides that Mountain and River Bell, what other Mountain and River Bell could there be?"

Youhun's expression twitched even more violently.

Though he was one of the Ten Great Emperors and lacked no Imperial Treasures, the Mountain and River Bell was a Primordial Era artifact. It was impossible not to covet it. Back when they besieged Wu Kuang, he risked injury just to kill the Origin Cauldron Great Emperor first, mainly because he feared the Mountain and River Bell's suppressive power.

Even Wu Kuang feared it. How could Youhun ignore it?

Power of Space. Years Like a Shuttle, Mountain and River Bell...

That brat's luck was simply too good. How could he get all the best things? An ordinary martial artist would be blessed to obtain just one, but he had them all. One could only marvel at how auspicious his ancestors’ tomb must be, to grant him such fortune.

Those without fortune have no luck—but this kid’s fortune was downright heaven-defying.

After a moment of silence, Youhun snorted coldly, "Why are you telling me all this? Truly boring!"

Duan Hongchen chuckled, "Just making conversation..."

He knew Youhun probably wouldn't try to kill Yang Kai. After all, he wasn't confident he could slay Yang Kai with just a Soul Descent body. If not for that, Duan Hongchen wouldn't have revealed all this information.

As they spoke, Duan Hongchen impatiently urged, "Hurry up and deal with things over there. I'm still waiting for you to separate me from Wu Kuang. That old dog has been squatting in my body, making it inconvenient for me to visit the brothel for some fun!"

Great Emperor Youhun was naturally a master of Divine Soul arts. Among the Ten Great Emperors, none understood the mysteries of the soul as deeply as he did. That was precisely why Duan Hongchen had come to the Soul Palace, seeking Youhun's help. He hoped Youhun might have a way to strip the soul of Wu Kuang from his own body.

If even Youhun couldn't do it, he'd have to maintain this state for now and think of another way. Just thinking about the days ahead made Duan Hongchen shiver.

Speaking of business, Youhun's expression grew serious, "Hongchen, I won't hide it from you. Your situation is a bit tricky. I may not be able to help."

"Whether you can or not, let's try first," Duan Hongchen said solemnly.

Youhun nodded and closed his eyes again.

Outside the Ancient Land passage, Yang Kai gripped the Myriad Sword, his mind focused on Elder Fu, not daring to relax for a moment.

The Soul Descended Great Emperor Youhun had told him to wait, then suddenly went silent. This left Yang Kai puzzled, not knowing what the guy was up to.

Should he take the opportunity to escape while he wasn't paying attention?

But if things here weren't resolved, he might be targeted by the Soul Palace. The Soul Palace and the Netherworld Sect were not on the same level. Being targeted by the Soul Palace was definitely bad news.

As he thought, an even bolder idea surfaced.

Should he strike first and kill the two in front of him to end it all?

But that thought only circled his mind once before Yang Kai dismissed it. If he really did that, he'd completely offend the Great Emperor Youhun.

Better observe for now. Yang Kai decided to adapt as needed. If the Great Emperor Youhun really tried to attack him, he could make plans then. Thinking this, he glanced at Lin'er, just in time to meet her gaze.

Their eyes met, and Yang Kai grinned fiercely, looking terrifying.

Lin'er was startled and quickly looked away, wondering what her father was doing. Why not just kill the brat? Her daughter was bullied and he didn't stand up for her—truly heartbreaking.

At that moment, Elder Fu, who had been standing motionless, suddenly seemed to come to his senses and looked up at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai couldn't help but swallow, then said stiffly, "Sir, do you have any instructions?"

Elder Fu's lips curled slightly as he sized up Yang Kai, then glanced at the twenty-plus dead Netherworld Sect disciples. He knew they hadn't died unjustly. With so much fortune and having joined forces with the Mortal Great Emperor against Wu Kuang, how could they be a match?

He said indifferently, "Those Netherworld Sect disciples were seeking death. You need not concern yourself with them."

Yang Kai shrugged, "I didn't want trouble, but they forced my hand."

Elder Fu nodded, his gaze thoughtful. "You handled it well. In the Star Realm, strength is everything. If you hadn't acted decisively, you wouldn't be standing here now."

Yang Kai smiled, "Thank you for your understanding, sir."

Elder Fu waved his hand, "Enough. Since the matter is settled, there's no need to dwell on it."

Yang Kai bowed slightly, grateful for Elder Fu's attitude. With the Great Emperor's words, the Netherworld Sect wouldn't dare pursue the matter further.

To think that the Mountain and River Bell—this Primordial Era artifact, after being taken away by Origin Cauldron tens of thousands of years ago, had actually returned here once more...

"I've more or less understood what happened," Elder Fu said blandly. "My daughter was indeed being unreasonable. This has nothing to do with you."

"Haha, sir, your insight is truly sharp." Hearing this, Yang Kai relaxed, knowing he was safe. Youhun was, after all, a Great Emperor. Since he said so, he wouldn't cause trouble for him.

On the other hand, Lin'er pouted angrily, her face full of displeasure.

Elder Fu nodded, "The Ancient Land is dangerous. Take care of yourself."

As he spoke, he reached out toward Lin'er, and Emperor Yuan surged, pulling her over. He was about to leave.

"Wait!" Seeing this, Yang Kai quickly called out.

"What else?" Elder Fu turned, looking at Yang Kai impatiently.

Yang Kai's mouth twitched, "Sir, you don't intend to just leave like this, do you?"

What a joke! He'd been injured by that unreasonable woman, and now they wanted to leave without compensation? Even if the Heavenly King himself came, Yang Kai wouldn't agree.

Elder Fu was stunned, his expression odd, "What do you want?"

Yang Kai bared his teeth, pointing to the gash on his chest, and grumbled, "Sir, this injury was caused by your daughter. My bones were cut, and it'll take at least a year or more to recover..."

Elder Fu's gaze dropped to Yang Kai's wound, watching the wriggling flesh, and couldn't help but twitch.

Was Yang Kai trying to fool him, acting as if he’d gone blind? Youhun didn’t know what kind of body-tempering cultivation Yang Kai practiced, but with his abilities, this wound was nothing more than a flesh wound—it would heal in just a few days. Yet he dared claim it would take a year or more! Outrageous!

Yang Kai seemed oblivious to his expression and continued, "Sir, as you said, the Ancient Land is dangerous. I have to venture inside, and if I die because of this wound, your daughter can't escape blame. If word gets out, it'll damage your reputation. People will say you let your daughter run wild. Tsk tsk... You care about your reputation, right?"

Threatening me? Elder Fu raised his brows, face darkening, "What exactly do you want?"

Yang Kai sheathed his sword and said loudly, "I'm fairly strong, but not confident about entering the Ancient Land. If you could reward me with a defensive Secret Treasure to cover my wound, that would be best."

Elder Fu was so angry he laughed, "What kind of defensive Secret Treasure do you want? Let's hear it."

Yang Kai replied seriously, "The bowl in your daughter's hand... looks pretty good..."

Lin'er was shocked and shouted, "You scoundrel, how dare you covet my treasure!"

Yang Kai glared, "Adults are talking. Children shouldn't interrupt!"

Elder Fu looked at Yang Kai with a smile, "You want the Jade Cinnamon Bowl?"

"So it's called the Jade Cinnamon Bowl..." Yang Kai raised his brows and grinned, "If you could reward me with it, that would be best. To be honest, I'm wandering the Star Realm alone, my pockets are empty. Even though I've reached the Emperor Realm, I still haven't managed to get any handy treasures. Life is hard!"

You have the Mountain and River Bell and still dare to claim poverty? Who would believe that! Elder Fu snorted inwardly.

Yang Kai pressed on, refusing to let the matter drop. "Sir, you're a Great Emperor—surely you don't lack for Imperial Treasures." He truly coveted the Jade Cinnamon Bowl; it was an excellent defensive artifact, and he happened to be short on such treasures. Leaving it in Lin'er's hands felt like a waste. If he could get it, it would be a huge boost to his strength.

"My father is my father, I'm me. Why are you so fixated on my treasure?" Lin'er was livid. This thief was truly hateful, pestering endlessly. If she could beat him, she'd have taught him a lesson long ago.

"You're the one who started this. Look at my wound!" Yang Kai puffed out his chest, and the gruesome wound made Lin'er immediately turn away.

He kept bringing up his wound, and it really did look scary.

Elder Fu was silent for a while, then nodded, "You have a point. It's not impossible to give the Jade Cinnamon Bowl to you!"

Hearing this, Yang Kai was overjoyed. He'd only wanted to try his luck. After all, the Great Emperor Youhun had a reputation to uphold. Even if he didn't give the Jade Cinnamon Bowl, anything else would do. Otherwise, his grudge with Lin'er would be for nothing.

But he never expected Great Emperor Youhun to be so agreeable. From his words, it sounded like he really would give him the Jade Cinnamon Bowl.

Yang Kai beamed and reached out to Lin'er, "Hand it over!"

Lin'er stared at Elder Fu, aggrieved, "Father!"

Elder Fu remained expressionless, "You can have the Jade Cinnamon Bowl, but not for free. This Lord will trade you for something. If you agree, the Jade Cinnamon Bowl is yours."

Yang Kai immediately became wary, "What is it?"

So there were conditions after all. What did that mean?
