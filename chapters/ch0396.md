## Chapter 396 — Golden Feather Eagle Comes Seeking

In the following days, Yang Kai closed himself off, telling the two elders that he needed to concoct the Pill Liquid.

All sorts of precious materials were sent into his room, all of which Yang Kai stored in the black book space.

These materials were not from the Yang Family but were gathered by Yang Yingfeng and his wife themselves. Although they were not top-tier treasures, they were classified at a decent level, with the highest reaching the lower level of Mystery-Grade.

Yang Kai had to create a sense of extraordinary illusion about this Pill Liquid, otherwise, if he easily concocted it, it would be difficult to explain its miraculous effects.

It was not that Yang Kai intended to hide the Wan Yao Ling Ye from the two elders; it was just that its origins were peculiar and concerned the remaining legacy of the Dan Sheng from Yao Wang Valley. If they found out, it would only add danger to their already precarious situation.

After over ten days, Yang Kai brought two large water bags filled with Wan Yao Ling Ye to Yang Yingfeng, advising him and Dong Suzhu to consume a drop daily.

He also gave an adequate amount of Wan Yao Ling Milk, which was crucial for expelling evil energy; meanwhile, the Wan Yao Ling Ye was primarily for cleansing their meridians and refining their marrow.

As for the highest grade Wan Yao Ling Paste, Yang Kai did not use it.

This item could assist one in comprehending the Heavenly Dao, and Yang Kai intended to wait until the two elders reached the pinnacle of the Divine Roaming Realm before using it to help them break through. Although that might take quite some time, Yang Kai was willing to wait.

Unbeknownst to the Fourth Master, who did not realize the value of Wan Yao Ling Ye, he casually accepted it, placing it aside, while looking at Yang Kai with a slightly peculiar expression, asking, “You’ll participate in the contention for the family leadership?”

Yang Kai sensed that he seemed to have something to say. Instead of answering, he countered with a question, “What do you mean?”

With a sigh, Yang Yingfeng said, “Your mother and I never anticipated you would grow so much during these years, hence we did not think about you participating in the contention for the family leadership. Your mother’s intention is… for you not to participate!”

Yang Kai’s gaze was piercing as he fixed it on him, a hint of a smile at the corners of his mouth.

When he asked for his opinion, his father only shared his mother’s thoughts, so he no longer needed to inquire about his father’s stance.

“Participate!” Yang Yingfeng declared solemnly. “Only by winning the position of family head can we legitimize our sect!”

“I think the same.”

The two looked at each other and laughed. As their laughter faded, Yang Yingfeng’s expression turned solemn. “Don’t blame your father for being somewhat selfish. I owe much to your Master; now I can only hope you repay that debt. The Lingxiao Pavilion cannot allow the inheritance to be cut off under your Master’s hands!”

“I understand, regarding mother…”

“I will speak to her. You don’t need to worry.” Yang Yingfeng waved his hand with audacious confidence.

“Understood.” Yang Kai nodded, relieved. Although Fourth Master often appeared to fear his wife, he was still capable of making the big decisions at home. Dong Suzhu would only tease him in trivial matters.

“By the way,” Yang Kai suddenly remembered something, “I need someone who is well-informed, quick-witted, yet loyal. Do you have anyone like that?”

“Got something to do?” Yang Yingfeng raised his thick eyebrows.

“Yes.”

After pondering for a moment, Fourth Master casually tossed a small item to Yang Kai, saying, “Go to the Tongtian Inn in the North District and find someone named Pang Chi. He should be able to help you.”

“What kind of person is he?” Yang Kai examined the item in his hand, discovering it to be a segment of green bamboo, approximately the length of a finger, crafted into the shape of a short flute that produced a sound when blown into lightly.

However, the material of this bamboo was unfamiliar to Yang Kai; it was neither metal nor jade, definitely not common material.

“The Bamboo Segment Gang Leader!” Yang Yingfeng smiled slightly. “I cultivated them myself. Although their individual strengths are not high, they are exceptionally skilled at gathering intelligence. If you can truly subdue them, it would greatly benefit you in the contention for the family leadership!”

“I understand.” Yang Kai nodded.

Fourth Master Yang felt somewhat guilty, saying, “I do manage a portion of the family’s strength, but I cannot give you any. During the contention for the family leadership, aside from those permitted by the family to participate, no one else is allowed to join. Even if I gave them to you, you wouldn’t be able to mobilize them.”

Yang Kai nodded gently, fully aware of this rule and naturally not insisting further.

“There’s still some time before the contention for the family leadership begins; you can use this time to familiarize yourself with them.” Yang Yingfeng smiled meaningfully.

Yang Kai also smiled, exhibiting a hint of danger.

Fourth Master Yang was taken aback, having never seen such an ominous side of Yang Kai.

Suddenly, the cry of an eagle echoed outside the house, causing Yang Yingfeng to frown and ask doubtfully, “Golden Feather Eagle?”

Yang Kai revealed a pleased expression and perked up his ears to listen. After a brief moment, another cry rang out, indeed confirming it was the Golden Feather Eagle.

Yang Yingfeng became puzzled. “Why would the Golden Feather Eagle come to our residence?”

The eagles of the Yang Family had always been managed by an external family. This family was quite small, consisting of only a few members, but their ancestors inherited a method to subjugate demonic beasts, which enabled them to live in the Yang Family and care for those rare beasts.

After returning to the Yang Family, the Golden Feather Eagle that had followed Yang Kai re-entered its cage but had not appeared for over ten days. Unexpectedly, it came looking for him today.

While Yang Yingfeng did not understand why the Golden Feather Eagle was here, Yang Kai knew very well.

It was likely that the eagle missed the taste of Wan Yao Ling Ye, which was why it had come seeking him.

The two hurried outside to see several servants standing under a tree, waving some meat, enticing the Golden Feather Eagle perched atop the branches.

Those meats were fresh blood food, the Golden Feather Eagle’s favorite delicacy. However, at this moment, that pair of eagle eyes did not even glance down; instead, it was staring fixedly at the interior of the house where Yang Kai was.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, the Golden Feather Eagle suddenly spread its wings and leapt down in a flash, landing on Yang Kai’s shoulder, nuzzling its beak affectionately against his hair.

A group of servants looked on in astonishment, even Yang Yingfeng was utterly amazed, staring at Yang Kai in a daze.

The Golden Feather Eagle had a high intelligence and a strong temperament; even the family that raised it would find it hard to soothe it if riled. Yet this Golden Feather Eagle flew onto Yang Kai’s shoulder and displayed such affection.

This had never happened before!

The Golden Feather Eagle continued to cry out, its sharp calls reverberating several li, becoming increasingly urgent, almost as if it were urging something.

“Quiet!” Yang Kai said sharply.

What stunned everyone was that the Golden Feather Eagle immediately ceased its cries, obediently perched on Yang Kai’s shoulder without moving.

“Master’s ability is truly remarkable!” a maid covered her mouth in surprise, her eyes sparkling with admiration as she looked at Yang Kai, her face flushed with excitement.

Another old servant chimed in, “I’ve been in the Yang Family for so many years, and I’ve never seen anyone who could make the Golden Feather Eagle obey like this. Today has truly opened my eyes.”

“How did you do it, Kai’er?” Fourth Master Yang questioned with furrowed brows.

“Maybe it developed feelings following me all this way,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly without elaborating.

Yang Yingfeng paused, seemingly incredulous.

The Golden Feather Eagle was notoriously difficult to train. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been managed by other family members. The previous generation of Yang Family heirs had also been retrieved by the Golden Feather Eagle. Yang Yingfeng had coexisted with an eagle for a long time, yet no matter how hard he tried then, the eagle remained indifferent. There was no affection like the current situation.

At that moment, a servant stepped in from outside and reported, “Master, Young Master, there’s someone named Du Chengbai at the door asking to see you.”

Fourth Master Yang thought for a moment and nodded, “Let him in.”

“Yes.”

Though Yang Yingfeng didn’t know who Du Chengbai was, he understood that the family responsible for raising and training the Yang Family’s Golden Feather Eagles was the Du family.

He likely chased the Golden Feather Eagle here; otherwise, no outsiders would dare wander about freely in the Yang Family's territory.

Not long after, that servant led in a middle-aged man. Before getting close, Du Chengbai cupped his fists repeatedly, smiling awkwardly, “The eagle trainer of the Du family greets Fourth Master Yang and Young Master!”

Yang Yingfeng acknowledged him, casually stating, “You’ve come to seek the Golden Feather Eagle, I presume?”

“Indeed,” Du Chengbai replied with a face full of embarrassment, “The eagle’s nature is hard to train; if it has intruded upon Fourth Master and Young Master’s domains, I ask for your forgiveness!”

“It’s no trouble. It was this demonic beast that brought me back in the past.” Yang Yingfeng shook his head, “In that case, take the eagle back, and take care of it properly.”

“Yes.” Du Chengbai nodded repeatedly, “Thank you for your understanding, Fourth Master!”

As he spoke, he gave Yang Kai an awkward smile and then turned serious as he looked at the Golden Feather Eagle, pursing his lips and whistling a series of crisp yet unintelligible tunes.

This was the communication method between the eagle trainer and the Golden Feather Eagle; in the past, whenever Du Chengbai produced this sound, the Golden Feather Eagle would obediently follow his commands, but this time, it clearly wasn’t effective.

The eagle seemed to possess even sharper intelligence than before. It tilted its head at him, its keen eyes holding a hint of mockery.

A group of servants surrounded, eager to witness the trainer's skills while Fourth Master Yang stood by sternly, causing Du Chengbai to feel nervous and complicated.

He blew for a while, but the Golden Feather Eagle appeared indifferent, and Du Chengbai’s mouth grew sore.

Cold sweat dripped from his forehead, and Du Chengbai felt even more awkward. Clearing his throat, he turned to Yang Kai and said, “Young Master, I beg your pardon.”

While saying this, he took a few steps forward, attempting to grab the Golden Feather Eagle that was perched on Yang Kai's shoulder.

“That’s very dangerous,” Yang Kai smiled at him.

Du Chengbai was left confused, not understanding the situation, when the Golden Feather Eagle suddenly emitted a swift cry and shot forward toward him like a streak of golden light.

Du Chengbai’s cultivation level was not particularly high, only around the seventh stage of the True Yuan Realm, yet he was still able to block this attack from the Golden Feather Eagle.

In haste, he waved his hand, forming a True Yuan barrier in front of him to nullify the strike of golden light, and he swiftly jumped back a few steps, staring incredulously at the Golden Feather Eagle.

Having raised eagles for so many years, he had never before been attacked by the Golden Feather Eagle, and he never expected to have such a close call today.
