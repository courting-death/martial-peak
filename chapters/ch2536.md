## Chapter 2536 — Limited Intelligence

After Elder Fu’s reminder, the red-clothed young woman no longer dared to mention sending a message back to the Palace to summon reinforcements. If she really did send word back, regardless of what happened to that pair of shameless lovers, she herself would definitely be put in confinement.

Thinking of this, the red-clothed young woman’s eyes reddened with grievance as she complained, “Father is so unfair! Why can my brother leave the Palace whenever he wants, without even needing to bring any guards, and no one cares even if he goes out killing and burning? But when it comes to me, not only do I have to bring you useless lot, there are so many rules to follow. Father is so unfair!”

She vented her resentment, shouting over and over.

Elder Fu didn’t dare echo her at all. His master was incredibly powerful—if the Young Lady called him unfair, it was fine, since she was his own daughter and any punishment wouldn’t be too severe. But if he himself agreed and the master found out, he’d probably lose his life.

“So what do we do now!” The red-clothed young woman stomped her foot, unable to calm the anger in her heart.

It was unrealistic to summon people from the Palace, and relying on the three people at her side for revenge was impossible. But she couldn’t just let this grudge go, could she? If she really did, she’d never be able to sleep again—this would become a lifelong nightmare, leaving a deep shadow in her heart.

Elder Fu seemed to have no good ideas either, his face scrunched up in worry.

“Useless, all of you are useless!” The more the red-clothed young woman looked at Elder Fu and the two guards, the angrier she became. She couldn’t help but curse, “I’ve been wronged and you can’t do anything about it—what use are you to me!”

Just then, Elder Fu’s eyes suddenly lit up, as if he’d thought of something. He said, “Miss, please calm down. This old servant might have a good idea.”

“What? Speak! As long as you can deal with those two shameless people and help me vent my anger, I’ll be sure to put in a good word for you with Father and get you a reward.”

Elder Fu chuckled and said, “Being able to serve at your side is already this old servant’s honor. There’s no need for—”

“Just say it, stop dawdling!” the red-clothed young woman interrupted impatiently.

Elder Fu cleared his throat and finally said, “We can’t mobilize people from the Palace, and the few of us aren’t a match for that brat. If you want revenge, Miss, we’ll have to borrow someone else’s strength.”

“Someone else?” The red-clothed young woman frowned. “Who?”

Elder Fu replied, “That’s something I’ll have to investigate. Let me see if there’s anyone nearby who could be of use to you.”

Hearing this, the red-clothed young woman’s beautiful eyes lit up. She urged, “Then hurry up and check! When I was still in the Palace, those people clung to me like dogskin plaster. Now that I need them, they surely won’t refuse, right?”

“Exactly, exactly. For them to be of use to you, Miss, is their honor—who would refuse?” Elder Fu flattered her with a smile. As he spoke, he took out a Transmission Compass from his Spatial Ring and said unhurriedly, “Please wait a moment, Miss, let me make some inquiries.”

As Elder Fu’s Divine Sense surged, the Transmission Compass in his hand emitted a faint glow. Clearly, he was sending a message to someone.

The red-clothed young woman stared expectantly, her beautiful eyes full of anticipation. She seemed to already envision Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi being surrounded by a large group under her command, forced to their knees to beg for mercy. The thought made her lips curl into a smile.

She swore to herself that when the time came, she would make Yang Kai kneel before her and lick the dust from her shoes, then scratch up that woman’s face and strip her naked to throw her into the busiest street.

Anyone who dares provoke me will never have a good end!

“Got it!” A moment later, Elder Fu’s brows lifted as he called out softly.

“Who’s nearby?” the red-clothed young woman asked excitedly.

Elder Fu said, “Not long ago, quite a few people from the Netherworld Sect entered the Ancient Land, even Elder Hua Feichen is here.”

“Hua Feichen?” The red-clothed young woman’s brows rose. “That Second Stage of the Emperor Realm guy who’s on good terms with you?”

“Yes, that’s him!”

The red-clothed young woman clapped her hands. “Ha! With Hua Feichen here, those two are doomed. Elder Fu, quickly send word to the Netherworld Sect and tell them to leave the Ancient Land. Say I have something for them to do.”

Elder Fu replied, “No need for all that trouble. We’ll just go into the Ancient Land and find them ourselves.”

The red-clothed young woman frowned. “Why should we go find them?”

Elder Fu thought to himself, This girl really has limited intelligence. She can’t even figure out such a simple question. Anyone else would have smacked her by now, but facing her, he could only patiently explain, “Miss, think about it—why did those two go looking for that old man?”

The red-clothed young woman looked at him blankly and asked, “Why?”

Elder Fu’s mouth twitched in frustration, but he still had to gently guide her, “Then why were we going to find that old man?”

“To have him lead us into the Ancient Land!” the red-clothed young woman said. “Didn’t people say he’s the best guide in all of the Desolate City? Otherwise, do you think I’d lower myself to go to such a shabby place?”

At this, the red-clothed young woman seemed to realize something and let out an ‘oh’. “So those two were also looking for that old man to enter the Ancient Land, right?”

Elder Fu thought, "Thank goodness you finally figured it out." It wasn’t easy, but he still praised her, “Miss, you truly are clever—one hint and you understand.”

The red-clothed young woman snorted, “It’s such a simple thing, why did you make it sound so complicated? Just say they’re also going into the Ancient Land.”

“Heh heh…” Elder Fu gave a dry laugh, then continued, “Since they’re going into the Ancient Land, we’ll just deal with them inside. That way, no one will find out and gossip.”

“Exactly!” The red-clothed young woman nodded and waved her hand. “In that case, let’s go into the Ancient Land too. Elder Fu, send word to Hua Feichen and tell him to fully cooperate with me. If this works out, I’ll reward him handsomely.”

“As you command!” Elder Fu cupped his fists in response.

With that, the four of them hurried toward the Ancient Land.

An hour later, not far from the entrance to the Ancient Land, Yang Kai, who was sitting cross-legged and examining a jade slip, suddenly let out a soft ‘huh’ and looked in a certain direction.

“What is it, sir?” Zhang Ruoxi asked suspiciously.

Yang Kai said, “It’s nothing. That overbearing Young Lady and her guards just entered the Ancient Land.”

“Hmph!” Zhang Ruoxi’s face was full of displeasure. “Someone as arrogant as her is just courting death by going in there!”

Yang Kai smiled slightly. “She may have a bad temper and be domineering, but she probably won’t die.”

“Sir, you’re actually speaking up for her?” Zhang Ruoxi pouted.

Yang Kai said, “It’s not that I’m speaking up for her, but she has an extraordinary background. She must have treasures given by her elders, so as long as she doesn’t act too recklessly, she shouldn’t be in any real danger.”

“Extraordinary background…” Zhang Ruoxi murmured, then realized, “Is that why you didn’t make things too difficult for them earlier?”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded. “That girl and Elder Fu aren’t much, but if I really killed them, it might attract some truly terrifying people. Besides… she hasn’t killed anyone, just acted a bit spoiled. Hopefully, after this lesson, she’ll restrain herself in the future.”

“You’re so thoughtful, sir, but I doubt she’ll appreciate it.” Zhang Ruoxi snorted.

Yang Kai glanced at her, then at the wine jar in her hand. “That Barbaric Wild Wine is pretty good, but don’t drink it too quickly. Savor the Primordial power within—it’ll help you once we’re inside.”

“Yes!” Zhang Ruoxi replied softly. Maybe it was the wine, but her cheeks were flushed, her breathing a little quick, and her beautiful eyes glistened with a hint of drunkenness.

“Right, I should give you this as well.” Yang Kai suddenly remembered something, took out the Ethereal Jade Disc from his Spatial Ring, and handed it to Zhang Ruoxi.

“Ethereal Jade Disc!” Zhang Ruoxi exclaimed softly.

“This is your Zhang Family’s ancestral treasure. It only resonates with you. Before, your cultivation wasn’t enough, so I didn’t dare give it to you. Now that you can protect yourself, take some time to comprehend the secrets within. Maybe… you’ll find the answer to your bloodline power.”

Zhang Ruoxi accepted it solemnly. The moment the Ethereal Jade Disc touched her hand, a strange spatial power suddenly surged out. Instantly, beautiful scenes appeared on the smooth surface of the disc.

Most of those scenes were of great rivers and spiritual mountains, magnificent and serene. Amidst the cloud-shrouded peaks, there were pavilions and towers, and even countless rare birds and beasts flashed by, each radiating a powerful aura, startling flocks of birds into flight.

A few years ago, when Zhang Ruoxi first touched the Ethereal Jade Disc, these scenes had also appeared.

Now they appeared again, but neither Yang Kai nor Zhang Ruoxi understood what they meant.

Yang Kai had thought the Ethereal Jade Disc contained some kind of spatial divine ability—after all, someone had used it to cultivate spatial power.

But Yang Kai had examined it many times and never found anything unusual.

The Ethereal Jade Disc seemed to only be activated in Zhang Ruoxi’s hands. No one knew what secrets it truly held.

Suddenly, Zhang Ruoxi looked up, gazing into the depths of the Ancient Land.

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise and asked in a deep voice, “What’s wrong?”

Zhang Ruoxi was silent for a long time before finally saying, “Sir, I feel like something in there is calling me.”

“Calling you?” Yang Kai was startled. The place she was looking at was deep within the Ancient Land—what could be calling her from there?

And this happened right after she received the Ethereal Jade Disc. Could it be related?

“Are you sure?” Yang Kai asked again.

Zhang Ruoxi frowned and was silent for a long while before shaking her head. “I’m not sure. It was just a fleeting feeling—it’s gone now.”

Yang Kai’s expression grew serious. After pondering for a moment, he said, “This Ethereal Jade Disc is truly strange. Maybe it really is connected to the Ancient Land. Perhaps it even originated from there. Once we’re inside, examine it carefully—you might discover something.”
