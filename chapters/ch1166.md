## Chapter 1166 — Do You Really Have a Master?

With Saint Crystals in hand, of course purchases must be made; Yang Flame produced a long list and ordered a large quantity of materials from Yingyue Hall.

Qian Tong took the list, glanced at it, and felt a chill move through him.

Each of those materials was supremely precious, and the quantities were vast; if they bought everything, it would cost at least forty to fifty million Saint Crystals. Qian Tong was not worried about the Saint Crystals—after all, Yang Kai had just gained over a hundred million in profit—he was simply puzzled why so many raw materials were needed.

Though puzzled, he did not ask further, only nodding as he said, “Yingyue Hall alone cannot muster all these materials, but rest assured, Nephew, I will contact the forces friendly with Yingyue Hall and will have these materials gathered and delivered to you within half a month.”

“Thank you, Senior.” Yang Kai cupped his hands in thanks.

Having said what needed saying, Qian Tong told Yang Kai to return and wait for news about the opening of Flowing Flame Sandland; Yang Kai took his leave at once.

Qian Tong personally escorted him out of Jubao Tower, then handed the list to Luo Qing: “Quickly collect all the materials we can find; if they come up short, contact nearby forces. As for price, just don’t sell yourself short.”

“Yes!” Luo Qing replied and left immediately.

Only then did Wei Guchang and Xuan’er arrive; seeing Qian Tong’s excited expression, Xuan’er asked in a soft voice, “Master, is that person impressive? Why do you value him so highly?”

“Impressive!” Qian Tong nodded heavily, glanced at the two disciples, and sighed, “Don’t you dare underestimate him. He’s indeed First Stage of the Saint King Realm, yet he can strike across ranks to kill Third Stage Saint Kings.”

A streak of sharp light flashed in Wei Guchang’s eyes. He looked surprised, but soon composed himself.

Because when he himself was First Stage of the Saint King Realm he could also slay ordinary Third Stage Saint King Realm practitioners, he did not think this was particularly extraordinary.

“It seems he does have talent,” Xuan’er reflected, pursing her lips and smiling. “But even so, it’s not worth you going out of your way to ingratiate yourself with him. Do you intend to recruit him into Yingyue Hall?”

“Recruit him into Yingyue Hall?” Qian Tong laughed loudly and said self-mockingly, “I’m afraid he wouldn’t look kindly upon us.”

“No way; although Yingyue Hall can’t compare with the three top powers like Star Emperor Sect, we are not weak,” Xuan’er said coquettishly.

“Do you know who stands behind him? What is his background?” Qian Tong slowly shook his head. “If you knew, you wouldn’t look down on him.”

“Elder, could you tell us in detail? I’m suddenly very interested.” Wei Guchang grinned—anyone favored so highly by the elder would certainly not be ordinary.

“We’ll talk as we walk.” Qian Tong beckoned them along; after all, this was still at the door of Jubao Tower. It was not appropriate to discuss such things standing there.

The three walked toward Tianyun City’s largest palace as Qian Tong said, “Guess who put up the Dragon-Slaying Whip and those Origin Condensing Pills for auction today?”

Xuan’er was slightly startled. “You mean…”

“Exactly—he’s the one who put them up.” Qian Tong nodded. “That Origin Condensing Pill is rare and valuable, but perhaps only a single one exists in the world—something obtained by chance and unlikely to appear again. The Dragon-Slaying Whip, however, was forged by his master.”

“What?” Wei Guchang was shocked. “That would mean his master is an Origin-Grade Middle-Level artificer? When did Dark Star produce such a high-level expert?”

“That is precisely why I want to make friends with him. Dark Star indeed cannot produce such a master; he came from outside.”

“Outside…” Wei Guchang and Xuan’er exchanged looks, their eyes filled with longing.

“Yes, he came from outside. Dark Star is almost isolated from the world; even the nearest cultivation stars are far away. The artificing level on Dark Star cannot produce the grand warships that can pierce Star Domains and withstand myriad dangers, so we have no sense of how marvelous the outside truly is. We only know that there are Void King Realm experts, Void King-Grade alchemists and artificers out there—realms we cannot reach.”

“If we can’t go outside, how did he arrive?” Xuan’er asked suspiciously.

“By sheer chance, I suppose.” Qian Tong smiled. “When I first made contact, I didn’t dare pry into his background for fear of offending him, but some time ago I had Luo Qing investigate and found that he was brought back by a Haike Family warship from the Starry Sky. He was the only one returned; he admitted he came from a place called Rainfall Star, which I’d heard of—there is indeed such a cultivation star.”

“If they only brought him back, why do you say someone like an Origin-Grade Middle-Level artificer stands behind him?”

“I don’t know that person’s intentions, but someone must have been shadowing and protecting him. When the Haike Family’s ship was about to return to Dark Star it was attacked by a large pack of Black Rock Beasts; the warship was on the verge of destruction and total loss. At the crucial moment a golden spear suddenly appeared, sweeping through the Black Rock Beast pack and rescuing them. Afterwards the Haike Family’s disciples didn’t know who saved them—their helper never showed his face.” Qian Tong spoke calmly. “Luo Qing uncovered this information; many Haike Family disciples personally witnessed it, so I can be certain someone protected Yang Kai then, and that person was likely his master.”

Qian Tong’s inference was reasonable; anyone with those reports and the cache of advanced Secret Treasures Yang Kai put up for sale would reach the same conclusion.

But he underestimated how monstrous Yang Kai was, and underestimated Yang Flame’s capacity for exaggeration; he mistook his own fabricated notion of a master for a plausible truth.

“No wonder—if he came from outside, then there could indeed be an Origin-Grade Middle-Level artificer behind him!” Wei Guchang nodded lightly.

“You are all prudent. I tell you this not to belittle you, but to make you recognize others’ strengths—do not underestimate anyone. These words are for your ears only; there is no need to let others know.”

“Disciples understand.” Both of them nodded firmly.

“Furthermore, I suspect Yang Kai’s master may be more than an Origin-Grade Middle-Level artificer. In any case, we mustn’t bear him ill will. He has agreed to refine an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure apiece for you as protection. He will also be going to Flowing Flame Sandland this time; you will have plenty of time to become acquainted—do not neglect him!”

“We’ll remember.” Wei Guchang and Xuan’er both nodded, a little remorseful that they had acted so haughty when their master led them into the private room earlier; they quietly resolved to get along with Yang Kai once Flowing Flame Sandland opened.

At Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai wrapped in his Star Shuttle descended and landed in front of the cave.

Wu Yi and Yang Flame both regarded him with a strange look; the two women kept watching him as he returned, leaving Yang Kai inexplicably puzzled.

“What do you want to ask?” Yang Kai frowned.

“Do you really have a master?” Wu Yi could no longer contain her curiosity.

“Why do you say that?”

“You asked me before which pills were valuable; I said the Origin Condensing Pill and the Void Ascension Pill, then you produced two Origin Condensing Pills—did your master give those to you?”

Yang Kai laughed. “What do you think?”

“I don’t know.” Wu Yi honestly shook her head.

“If I had a master, wouldn’t you be able to tell?”

“Then those Origin Condensing Pills…”

“If I say I refined them myself, would you believe me?”

The two women shook their heads in unison.

It's fine if they don’t believe it. Yang Kai finally understood why Yang Flame’s boasting that she herself was an Origin-Grade artificer had been met with disbelief—same principle as now.

Not to bicker further, Yang Kai tossed the Spatial Ring Qian Tong had given him to Yang Flame: “Refine two defensive Secret Treasures—doesn’t have to be too good, Origin-Grade Lower-Level will do.”

“I know.” Yang Flame nodded. Two Origin-Grade Lower-Level defensive Secret Treasures weren’t difficult for her, especially now that she had the Stone Puppet’s help; with the puppet assisting, her speed at refining Secret Treasures was many times faster than before.

The most time-consuming part of refining Secret Treasures was tempering the materials—repeatedly purging the dross and preserving the essence; it wasted time and consumed great spirit, but the Stone Puppet could complete that process in a very short time. No wonder Yang Flame said the Stone Puppet was the artificer’s best assistant; there was truth to it.

Previously, it took Yang Flame one to two months to refine an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure; now it only took three or four days—a gulf of difference.

“I will begin seclusion to prepare for entering Flowing Flame Sandland; mind things here yourselves.” Yang Kai instructed, then dove into the cave, entered his stone chamber, closed the stone door, and entered seclusion.

The opening time of Flowing Flame Sandland was uncertain, but he had at least a month or two to use.

Yang Kai needed to use this period to improve his combat strength.

As for Secret Treasures, he needed to quickly finish nurturing the purple shield and the Hundred Mountains Painting. Both had already been refined — all that remained was to let them attune more closely to himself, and then he would be able to use them in battle.

For Pills, he planned to refine a bottle or two of Ice-Snow Pills as backups.

The Ice-Snow Pills appearing at the auction were Origin-Grade Lower-Level, and were within his current refining capability; he lacked neither the materials nor the means.

As for other things like Healing Pills, he already had plenty and needn’t refine more. He had great confidence in his body’s recovery ability; if necessary he could burst a drop of Golden Blood—imbued with tremendous vitality, unless the injury damaged his foundation it should restore him.

The remaining matter, and the most crucial, was that Yang Kai wanted to quickly enhance the power of his Space Blade.
