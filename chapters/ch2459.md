## Chapter 2459 — It's Good That You're Alive

Within the Void Passage, Yang Kai moved as if walking on solid ground, swiftly traversing through, completely ignoring the ever-present chaotic void currents and the unpredictable spatial rifts.

This place might be fraught with danger for others, but for Yang Kai, it was like his own backyard. When he cultivated Spatial Power, he had entered such places many times, comprehending the mysteries of space and learning the ways of Spatial Force. He had long since mastered this environment's characteristics.

Less than an hour after parting ways with Lan He, Yang Kai suddenly felt a slight heat on the back of his hand. It was the resonance between Star Seals. His expression shifted, and he immediately sped off in a certain direction.

His current Star Seal was a high-grade Six-Pointed Star Seal, so he could sense the positions of most martial artists from far away.

Before long, he arrived at the location, but the scene that greeted his eyes made him frown.

Ahead was a bloody mess. Countless severed limbs and chunks of flesh floated and sank with the surging void currents—there wasn’t a single living person in sight.

However, in that area, seven or eight unclaimed Star Seals floated quietly.

Seven or eight Star Seals meant that seven or eight people had died here. They weren’t killed by others, but had fallen into this Void Passage, devoured by the void currents or shredded by the spatial rifts here.

As Yang Kai approached, the unclaimed Star Seals were drawn to him, shooting toward the back of his hand, turning into points of starlight and branding themselves onto his skin, making his Six-Pointed Star Seal even brighter and warmer.

He couldn’t help but feel a bit worried.

Everyone had been swallowed into this place by the collapsing space, their fates unknown. He wasn’t concerned about the others’ lives or deaths; the only one he worried about was Yin Lesheng. That guy absolutely must not die before Yang Kai found him—if he died, Yang Kai would have no way to question him for information.

There was still a faint sense of resonance coming from ahead.

Yang Kai didn’t linger and continued on his way.

The further he went, the more corpses of martial artists and lingering Star Seals he encountered.

He didn’t need to do anything—just by passing through, he had already collected more than twenty Star Seals along the way.

In other words, of the forty-some Dao Origin Realm martial artists swallowed into this place, half were already dead. Judging by what he saw along the way, they must have stuck together, probably trying to find an exit by heading in this direction. Unfortunately, not understanding Spatial Power, they couldn’t break through the spatial barriers and had no way out.

At that rate, it was only a matter of time before the group was completely wiped out.

Suddenly, a faint cry for help reached Yang Kai’s ears. His eyes sharpened, and he darted toward the source of the sound.

Soon, he arrived in front of a surging void current.

Sensing Yang Kai’s arrival, the person calling for help hurriedly shouted in his direction, “Friend, save me! Don’t leave me behind, please save me!”

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent. Sweeping the area with his Divine Sense, he instantly recognized who the man was—and saw that he was already entangled by the chaotic void currents. At this rate, it wouldn’t be long before he was completely swallowed up.

“Where’s Yin Lesheng?” Yang Kai suddenly asked.

The man was stunned for a moment upon hearing the voice, then called out softly, “Yang Kai?”

He clearly recognized Yang Kai’s voice as well.

“Where is Yin Lesheng?” Yang Kai pressed again.

The man gave a bitter smile. “Brother Yang, save me first, and everything else can be discussed.”

Yang Kai snorted coldly. “Even Chang Hao wouldn’t save you—why should I?”

This person was none other than Chang Xian of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. He and Chang Hao were both Holy Sons of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land, their strength extraordinary. But no matter how strong, they were still at the Dao Origin Realm. Falling into the void current meant only waiting for death—the more they struggled, the faster they died. There was no sign of Chang Hao here; it seemed he had already abandoned Chang Xian and left.

“Chang Hao!” Hearing the name, Chang Xian seemed to have a nerve struck. He gnashed his teeth and growled, “Don’t mention that despicable scoundrel in front of me! One day, I’ll kill him!”

Who knew what had happened between these two Holy Sons for Chang Xian to hate Chang Hao so deeply.

Yang Kai couldn’t be bothered to dig into it and just sneered, “Talk about it if you ever get out of here.”

Hearing this, Chang Xian’s momentum plummeted. He pleaded, “Brother Yang, be magnanimous, don’t hold a grudge against me. Save me from here, and I, Chang Xian, will surely repay your kindness.”

“Tell me first—which way did Yin Lesheng go?” Yang Kai stared at him coldly.

Chang Xian said, “If I tell you, will you save me?”

Yang Kai retorted, “What do you think?”

Chang Xian grew angry. “Then why should I tell you?” But as soon as he finished, he realized he had no right to be angry at a time like this and quickly added, “Don’t be upset, Brother Yang, it was a slip of the tongue.”

Yang Kai snorted, “I have no intention of saving you, nor will I. No matter what you say, it’s useless!”

Chang Xian’s expression turned panicked, rage boiling in his heart, but he dared not show it. The bitterness in his mouth was worse than eating bitter herbs.

“I won’t save you, but I can avenge you!” Yang Kai sneered. “Chang Hao and Yin Lesheng are together, right? Tell me which way they went, and I’ll help you kill Chang Hao.”

“Kill Chang Hao…” Chang Xian was stunned, then suddenly burst into mad laughter, his voice full of crazed intent.

Yang Kai didn’t rush him, just stood by coldly watching.

After a while, Chang Xian’s laughter stopped, his face twisted. “If you find Chang Hao, tear him to pieces for me!”

“That’s easy. I promise you!” Yang Kai nodded, thinking there must be some unknown grudge between these two Holy Sons, or Chang Xian wouldn’t hate Chang Hao so much.

“They went that way.” Chang Xian casually pointed in a direction.

Yang Kai turned to look, then nodded. With a slight movement of his hand, a Moon Blade slashed toward Chang Xian.

Chang Xian was shocked. Although he sensed the energy coming at him, he was trapped in the void current and couldn’t dodge. He could only cry out in horror, “What are you doing?”

With a soft whoosh, Chang Xian felt a sharp pain in his arm.

Yang Kai said coldly, “I’ll be taking your Star Seal as interest for when you all ganged up on me before. As for the rest, you’re on your own.” As he spoke, he reached out and took the Star Seal from Chang Xian’s severed arm, then turned and sped off in the direction Chang Xian had indicated.

“Bastard! Bastard!” Chang Xian clutched his wound with his other hand, roaring in fury, his face twisted.

But Yang Kai was already gone.

Continuing forward, about half a day later, Yang Kai finally sensed the positions of others. But most were already dead, either devoured by the void currents or shredded by the spatial rifts, their bodies mangled beyond recognition, leaving only Star Seals to guide Yang Kai’s way.

Another day passed, and Yang Kai had collected nearly all the Star Seals from the forty-some people.

After his Six-Pointed Star Seal absorbed more than thirty Star Seals, it finally transformed, becoming a Seven-Pointed Star Seal, allowing him to sense even farther.

Rumor had it that if a Star Seal could be upgraded to the highest Nine-Pointed Star Seal, one could find the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s legacy. Whether that was true or not, Yang Kai didn’t know, but he had no interest in that so-called legacy and wouldn’t go out of his way for it.

At a certain moment, Yang Kai suddenly sensed several Star Seals fluctuating ahead. After a quick calculation, he knew these belonged to the last survivors.

Yin Lesheng had to be among them, because along the way, Yang Kai had found the corpses of two other Netherworld Sect disciples, but not Yin Lesheng’s. That guy was really lucky, surviving in the Void Passage until the end—who knew how he managed it.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai flickered and sped off in that direction.

After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, he arrived at the place where those people were.

Sweeping with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai found that only four people were still alive. Yin Lesheng and Chang Hao were among them, and the other two also looked like top Dao Origin Realm experts, though Yang Kai didn’t know them.

Not only were those four here, but even the Mountain and River Bell, which had vanished into the void, was here as well.

This ancient treasure from the primordial era had brought about the birth of a Great Emperor and witnessed the wars between emperors. After lying dormant for tens of thousands of years, it now quietly lay somewhere in the Void Passage, its brilliance withdrawn, devoid of any spiritual aura, like a broken relic, waiting for its next master.

“You’re actually alive!” When Yang Kai arrived, Yin Lesheng suddenly turned, staring at him in shock.

Yin Lesheng knew Yang Kai was skilled in spatial powers. Back when they fought in the Starlight Passage, Yang Kai had used spatial divine abilities to shatter the passage.

What surprised Yin Lesheng was that Yang Kai had taken the Mountain and River Bell’s shockwave at such close range and had been struck by his Shura Earth Fiend, yet had survived. Not only that, but he looked full of life now.

Yang Kai curled his lip. “You’re alive too, Brother Yin, so why be so surprised?”

Yin Lesheng’s eyes lit up and he nodded. “Good, good, very good. It’s good that you’re alive.”

He actually looked genuinely happy for Yang Kai, though who knew why.

Yang Kai looked at him suspiciously. “Brother Yin, the way you’re talking is a bit misleading. You make it sound like we’re on good terms.”

Yin Lesheng laughed loudly. “No matter what our relationship is, it’s a good thing you’re alive.”

Yang Kai’s face turned cold. “Since I’m alive, you’re dead for sure.”

Yin Lesheng replied calmly, “There’s no real grudge between us. Why not just let bygones be bygones and laugh it off here?”

Yang Kai glared. “Did I hear that right? Brother Yin, you actually want to let bygones be bygones with me? Are you out of your mind?”

Chang Hao and the other two also looked at each other strangely. After all, they’d all seen the conflict and enmity between Yang Kai and Yin Lesheng—both had wanted to kill each other. How had Yin Lesheng’s attitude changed so suddenly?
