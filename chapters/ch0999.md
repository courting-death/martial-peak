## Chapter 999 — Strange Old Man

That peculiar old man gave Lü Guichen and the Sword Alliance's beautiful woman, Yue Xi, an unnerving feeling unlike anything they'd encountered before; both remained on guard even after stopping, quietly watching him.

"Yue Xi, we've known each other a long time; we both understand that neither of us can truly force the other. How about we end this duel here for today? I think both your people and mine need time to recover." Lü Guichen clasped his hands behind his back and called out to the Sword Alliance's beauty.

The woman called Yue Xi pondered for a moment, then lightly nodded. "Fine."

"Knew you'd be reasonable." Lü Guichen laughed heartily, was the first to sheath his golden armor and put away his spear. He frowned and added, "Yue Xi, there's something I've been itching to ask."

“If you’ve got something to say, say it. Don’t waste my time with nonsense.” A hint of impatience flashed across Yue Xi's lovely face; her words were hardly polite.

Lü Guichen curled his lip dismissively and pointed downward with a finger. "Is that old fellow one of your Sword Alliance people? Why have I never seen him before?"

At his question, Yue Xi's expression instantly turned odd. She looked suspicious. "He's not one of yours?"

Lü Guichen was taken aback for a moment, then slowly shook his head.

The two of them exchanged a glance; in an instant their eyes brightened and they both cried out, "There were people here all along?!"

As soon as those words left their mouths, both transformed into beams of light and darted down toward the old man who was below scavenging fragments of a warship.

Neither Lü Guichen nor Yue Xi knew what this place was or what dangers it hid.

Yet at this moment, an indigenous inhabitant suddenly appeared right under their very noses!

Naturally they wanted to strike first and seize the old man, to question him and learn whatever information they could. In an unknown place, knowledge can become absolute advantage — they understood this better than anyone.

So without a word they acted together.

Two surges of power characteristic of Saint King Realm experts roared outward, far stronger than during their earlier clash. Both radiated an aura of absolute certainty.

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi had known each other for years and knew each other's capabilities well; their strengths were comparable, and almost at the same instant they lunged at the old man, each seizing one of his arms, staring each other down with neither willing to yield.

The old man had just picked up a shard of the warship and had not yet placed it into his space ring when disaster struck. He seemed stunned, his body frozen in place, unable to move.

Then his expression shifted to something strange — a trace of interest passed over his face. Amid the standoff between two Saint King Realm experts, he calmly slipped the warship shard into his space ring.

This odd action stunned Lü Guichen and Yue Xi. In the next moment they realized something was terribly wrong.

To remain so utterly unconcerned in the face of both of them, that old man was either mad or possessed of extraordinary ability, utterly ignoring them.

The latter seemed far more likely.

So Lü Guichen and Yue Xi simultaneously released their grips and tried to distance themselves from the strange old man.

At that instant the old man's body suddenly emitted a crazed pulling force; in a flash his form seemed to turn into a quagmire, dragging Lü Guichen and Yue Xi down so deep they could not free themselves.

Moments later both felt their Saint Yuan rapidly siphoned away, streaming ceaselessly into the old man's body.

They were horrified; Yue Xi even screamed aloud.

As he drained their strength, the old man's face grew plumper and healthier, as if being nourished mightily; even his graying hair gradually regained luster and darkened.

The old man grinned, smiled faintly and mysteriously at them without speaking.

Only then did a dreadfully dangerous aura leak from his body; that presence spread and made everyone tremble, forcing them to stop their actions.

Each person's ears seemed to be filled with the cries of ghosts and wolves, and a cold wind blew; merely from the old man's aura everyone felt as though they had plunged into the nine‑nether hell, suffering torments worse than death.

"You two little brats are way too presumptuous. Hmph—it's been ages since I've seen such excitement. This time I'll spare your lives, but if you dare again, I'll tear your souls apart!" The old man sneered, his body quivering as an immense shockwave burst forth from him.

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi cried out and were blasted backward like kites with snapped strings, spitting clouds of blood in midair, their expressions wan and listless.

They had nearly lost their lives on the spot under the old man’s frenzied siphoning.

When they regained their footing and looked again at the old man, their eyes were filled with profound terror.

Yang Kai's own eyes trembled violently; he could hardly believe what he had witnessed.

Lü Guichen's transcendent power was something Yang Kai had personal experience with; under Lü Guichen's grip he had no room to resist.

Lü Guichen was at least Saint King, Second Stage, perhaps even Third Stage.

Yet in front of that bizarre old man, such an expert seemed laughably like a three‑year‑old child.

So what level of cultivation did that old man possess? Yang Kai dared not imagine.

"Hm, it's rare to have so many people come here. Don't slaughter your fellows; one death leaves the place lonelier sooner." The old man muttered, then suddenly issued an order.

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi stared at him in a daze, then hastily nodded. "We'll obey, Senior!"

After witnessing the old man's transcendent might, none of them dared act rashly; they all knew that if he wanted, he could easily slaughter every person here.

His strength was beyond anything they could withstand.

"Ah, it's a pity to waste the dead; let them come in." The old man murmured, tossed his hand and a jet‑black banner suddenly appeared. The banner radiated a grim aura and vague, ephemeral silhouettes of people and beasts swirled within it — those figures were Spirit Bodies, each monstrously powerful and heart‑chilling.

They were all bound within the banner, seemingly stripped of self‑awareness and turned into bloodthirsty, cruel resentful souls.

The banner fluttered in the wind, its howls of ghosts and wolves resounding through the heavens.

Translucent Spirit Bodies rose from the corpses of the dead warriors, as if summoned by fate, and surged toward the banner.

In a short while the jet‑black banner absorbed thirty to forty Spirit Bodies from the fallen.

Like a pebble tossed into a calm lake, ripples spread across the banner's surface; the bound resentful souls went mad and swarmed to devour the newly arrived Spirit Bodies.

The crunching of their chewing echoed unceasingly, invading people's minds.

In the blink of an eye, the dozens of Spirit Bodies belonging to the Purple Star and the Sword Alliance were devoured clean, as if they had never existed.

The banner's sinister fluctuations deepened.

"If any of you stir up trouble again, I'll take you all inside!" the old man warned with an eerie smile as he folded the Pitch‑Black Banner away.

Everyone's faces turned pale; no one dared answer.

Having seen that scene, who would dare act? Even after death their Spirit Bodies could be devoured — a fate more terrifying than death.

So everyone quieted down and reined in their strength.

"Find places to settle yourselves and get familiar with the environment. Also, let me tell you, there's no danger here; supplies are abundant and Spiritual Qi is rich — very suitable for cultivation. Do not approach the mountain within fifty li — that is where I live. Anyone who dares approach will bear the consequences!" The old man pointed to a nearby peak and chattered on as if he had not spoken in years, then drifted away and vanished in the blink of an eye.

After he left, a long while passed with no one daring to move; everyone remained frozen, chests pounding and swallowing nervously.

Lü Guichen and Yue Xi exchanged a long, wordless look across the distance between them.

Soon they took out pills and popped them, then produced Saint Crystals to restore their strength.

After an hour, the two rose to their feet one after the other.

Only when they began to move did the surviving Purple Star and Sword Alliance warriors dare to breathe — they hurried over to them.

"Yang Kai! Yang Kai!" a voice called nearby. Yang Kai looked up and saw He Miao's face pale as she waved to him.

Yang Kai stood and walked toward them.

Several dozen zhang away, Bi Ya clenched her silver teeth and glared resentfully in their direction, but dared not interfere.

The old man had warned that anyone who caused trouble would have their Spirit Bodies taken into that Pitch‑Black Banner; Bi Ya did not want to tempt his wrath.

"Thank you." Yang Kai reached He Zao and He Miao's side and thanked them sincerely.

If not for them holding Bi Ya back earlier, he would not have had the chance to escape before the old man had unleashed his power.

"No need." He Zao shook her head. "We owe you."

"Who is that old fellow? He scared me to death." He Miao patted her chest, still shaken.

"Master must have sensed something," He Zao said thoughtfully as she regarded the beauty Yue Xi. "Regardless, with him speaking, the Purple Star people won't act rashly anymore. This place is safe for now. Yang Kai, has your strength been sealed?"

"Yes. That Lü Guichen made his move." Yang Kai inclined his head.

"Come with me. I'll take you to see Master and ask her to help break the seal in your body."

"Thanks to you both." Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

"Don't mention it." He Miao giggled, finally regaining some spirit. "If you hadn't given my sister and me some restorative supplies earlier, we wouldn't have lasted until Master arrived. In that sense, we still owe you our lives."

"It's nothing." Yang Kai nodded lightly, neither overly warm nor cold, the manner of a stranger repaying a favor.

Following He Zao and He Miao toward where the Sword Alliance had gathered, they soon arrived before Yue Xi.
