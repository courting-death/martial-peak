## Chapter 869 — Who Doesn’t Have a Few Secrets

With every assault by the ancient demon clansmen, foes had their heads or bodies cleaved off, gore spraying everywhere.

Dark, viscous demon yuan surged like trapped beasts unleashed, ramming through the crowd and annihilating the will and resistance of the disciples from Poxuan Palace and War Soul Hall. They screamed, prayed, and died in despair.

The once-pure snow mountain had become Shura’s Purgatory, blood gathering and flowing like streams, limbs scattered, corpses hurled about.

In a short while, the disciples of the two factions had already suffered over a thousand casualties.

Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and the others’ eyes were rimmed red as they bellowed and howled, trying to resist, but against Li Rong and the others they were powerless and could only be slaughtered.

Those in the Transcendent Realm were nearly all slain.

Even the four who had entered the Saint Realm were gradually losing strength.

Zhang Ao’s methods were formidable; the backlash from his attacks even struck down several lesser ancient demon clansmen, which only made Li Rong more ruthless.

Yang Kai watched all this indifferently, fully understanding what survival of the fittest meant.

As time passed, the battle gradually subsided.

Bodies and gore lay everywhere; the ancient demon clansmen were drenched in blood, howling to the sky, their murderous intent still palpable. The rising murderous qi coalesced, making the whole place feel oppressive.

Of Poxuan Palace and War Soul Hall’s four Saint Realm disciples, three were killed on the spot; only Zhang Ao was captured alive.

Thick bloodlight coiled around him like ropes, binding him immobile. Li Rong hauled him before Yang Kai, awaiting his judgment.

Standing at the center of this Shura’s Purgatory, Yang Kai closed his eyes and let the World-Ending Demon Eye in his Sea of Consciousness emit a powerful pulling force, absorbing the scattered soul energies across the land.

Zhang Ao trembled and waited in terror, not knowing what fate awaited him. Once confident, his face now ran cold sweat as he looked at Yang Kai in panic.

After a long moment, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and looked down at Zhang Ao.

"Saint Lord Yang… I’m at least a notable expert. This time you’re being magnanimous—spare my life. I will defect and serve you, obeying your orders!" Before Yang Kai could speak, Zhang Ao hastily pleaded, fearing Yang Kai would kill him immediately.

Li Rong and the others couldn’t help but reveal disdain at his cowardice.

"A notable expert… not bad, chased me for months," Yang Kai said with a light nod. "But sorry—I'm not interested. The power I’ve gathered is already enough; one more or one less makes no difference. Keeping you is more harmful than helpful."

"No, Saint Lord Yang, I’ll do anything you ask…" Sensing Yang Kai’s murderous intent, Zhang Ao panicked and turned his gaze to Sect Master Wu, shouting, "Sect Master Wu, for the sake of our years of friendship, say a word for me."

Wu Jie sighed deeply. "Brother Zhang… sins inflicted by heaven can be forgiven, but sins brought by one’s own hand cannot be lived with… I advised you two years ago to stop when you could. Yet you insisted on slaughter. Now the situation has reversed—what can I even say? I’m also under the Saint Lord’s protection and merely scraping by. I can’t speak here."

Hearing Wu Jie refuse, Zhang Ao grew despondent and hurriedly said, "Saint Lord Yang, I have one secret. If you promise not to kill me, I’ll tell all."

"A secret?" Yang Kai chuckled. "Who doesn’t have a few secrets? What value would yours possibly have to me?"

"This secret may relate to the legendary mystery of the starry sky. I think Saint Lord Yang would be interested. As the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, you will one day break through to the peak of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; such a top-tier expert pursues the Way of the Starry Sky!" Zhang Ao said in a low voice.

Yang Kai’s brow twitched; he was intrigued and leaned in to ask, "Why would it be related to the mystery of the starry sky?"

"Because I personally experienced it once—apparently I was in an endless starry sky, stars all around, very strange…"

"Master, this guy may be stalling or making things up," Han Fei said coldly.

Yang Kai raised a hand, gesturing to Zhang Ao, "Continue."

Seeing Yang Kai genuinely interested, Zhang Ao brightened and hurried on, "And there was a strange power surging there. Even though I was at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, I could barely bear it; it felt like my body would be crushed to pieces. I think only those at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm could withstand such terrifying energy with their flesh."

Yang Kai frowned. What Zhang Ao described was very similar to his own experience in the starry sky. He began to believe Zhang Ao might be telling the truth; someone who hadn’t been to the starry sky would find it hard to describe such things accurately.

After a moment’s thought, Yang Kai grinned. "You sound plausible, but how do you know that place is the starry sky?"

"To be honest, at first I didn’t pay it much mind. One day I found a very strange stone in the sect; it didn’t look like it belonged to this continent… Over the following years I often found similar fragments there, until one day I obtained something."

"What did you obtain?" Yang Kai asked sternly.

"It’s in my Spatial Pouch. You can inspect it yourself—after you see it, you’ll know whether I’m lying," Zhang Ao said, indicating the pouch.

Yang Kai glanced at the Spatial Pouch, reached for it, and was about to open it when Li Rong stepped forward, "Master, let me."

She clearly didn’t trust Zhang Ao, afraid he might have tampered with the pouch.

Yang Kai nodded and handed the Spatial Pouch to Li Rong.

Li Rong took it and opened the pouch. Before she could examine it closely, a strange, peculiar force shot out from the mouth of the pouch and struck her beautiful eyes, vanishing into them.

Li Rong froze mid-motion, her body trembling slightly as if in great pain.

"There really is something strange!" Han Fei’s expression went cold; without hesitation she struck Zhang Ao with a palm, shattering the bones in half of his torso before he could rise.

"Don’t kill him!" Yang Kai hastily stopped her, his face dark as water, and rushed over to check Li Rong’s injuries.

Had Li Rong not volunteered, he likely would have been the one struck!

"I’m fine… it was only a wisp of soul-attack," Li Rong said lightly, supporting her forehead. "There was a mind-control influence, but it’s been dispelled."

Since Li Rong was also at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, Zhang Ao’s covert method could not affect her.

Zhang Ao’s eyes darkened, showing obvious unwillingness.

What he didn’t know was that even if that wisp of soul-attack had been aimed at Yang Kai, it would have had no effect.

He had schemed to lure Yang Kai into inspecting the Spatial Pouch and thereby seize control, but he had failed.

After Han Fei’s blow, Zhang Ao lay on the ground gasping in pain, glancing at everyone with a complicated expression.

Yang Kai let out a few low chuckles and walked to Zhang Ao’s side, slightly nodding. "Bold. Tell me—how do you want to die?"

Zhang Ao’s eyes were filled with resentment and helplessness. He said nothing; he clearly knew there was no escape this time.

Yang Kai waved impatiently. "Kill him."

Zhang Ao roared, "Kill me and you'll never learn that secret!"

He tried one last effort.

Han Fei answered with a lethal strike.

Unnoticed by others, Zhang Ao’s soul energy leaked from his Sea of Consciousness and was absorbed by Yang Kai.

The spirit body retreated into the Sea of Consciousness; Yang Kai carefully stored Zhang Ao’s soul force in a corner to examine later when he had time.

He was still rather interested in the secret Zhang Ao had mentioned just before he died.

Everyone from Poxuan Palace and War Soul Hall had been wiped out. Wu Jie felt a bitter-sweet sorrow—grieving for the dead yet secretly relieved. He was glad he’d specifically sought out Yang Kai a few years ago; otherwise, Netherworld Sect would likely have suffered the same fate with no chance of survival.

"Wu Jie, none of the dead are from your Netherworld Sect, right?" Yang Kai glanced at him.

Wu Jie slowly shook his head. "When I was fleeing I sent word to the deputy sect master to lead the others away. Zhang Ao and his group were eager to chase you and probably had no time to deal with them. Those who died here were only from Poxuan Palace and War Soul Hall. It seems even Ancient Moon Sanctuary and Rashomon Gate abandoned them."

"That's for the best." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"My people don’t seem to have gone far…" Wu Jie sensed slightly. "Saint Lord, may I summon them over?"

Yang Kai nodded and did not object.

"Lady Li…" The newly promoted leaders Yinya and Xueji arrived just then, holding a Spatial Pouch. "We collected the bones of Senior Coffin-Servant that we could find," they reported.

Li Rong’s expression darkened as she reached out to take it.

Yang Kai looked at her and said softly, "My condolences—Senior Coffin-Servant’s wish was at least fulfilled."

"As you say, Master."

"Rest here tonight; get used to the outside world and tidy yourselves up. We’ll leave early tomorrow."

"Yes!" Li Rong obeyed and, along with Han Fei and the others, busied herself with preparations.

Only now did the demon marks enveloping the ancient demons’ bodies gradually fade, and the dense, substantive murderous qi dissipated, easing the oppressive atmosphere.

Nearly a thousand ancient demons had fought; a few dozen died. The survivors buried their kin on the spot, weeping in sorrow.

They had longed and waited for countless years, finally emerging from the Small Xuan Realm today—only to lose their lives before they could truly see this world. Those still alive mourned them deeply.
