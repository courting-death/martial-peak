## Chapter 1525 — You Got the Guts?

At Kaiyun Peak, Ye Xijun stood proud in midair, and more than two hundred Star Emperor Mountain disciples all looked up at her.

Yang Xiuzhu and the other two exchanged a glance, sensing the moment had arrived; they dropped to one knee in unison and called out in a low, resonant voice, “We respectfully welcome the Sect Master back to the mountain!”

“We respectfully welcome the Sect Master back to the mountain!” Those who had been tipped off by Yang Xiuzhu and had friendly ties with him echoed in unison, their voices booming with incomparable force.

The remaining people glanced left and right, and, recognizing the tide of the moment, all performed grand bows with decorum.

A large portion of these people had no strong opinions about who should be Sect Master; they leaned neither toward Ye Xijun nor toward the current incumbent. They were the sort who avoided trouble and preferred to go with the flow when the situation turned.

Bai Xi and the two others who had rushed over earlier were thrown into panic; their faces drained of color and took on an unprecedentedly ugly look.

“Bai Xi!” Yang Xiuzhu barked coldly. “The Sect Master is here—are you not going to kneel?”

“She’s not the Sect Master—the Sect Master’s position already belongs to another. Why should I bow to her?” Bai Xi snorted coldly. He was an old fox and could see the tide had already turned. Still, he hadn’t expected that despite the current Sect Master’s century of careful management, the foundation remained so fragile—while Ye Xijun, after merely reappearing once in a hundred years, had shattered it completely.

At that moment the authority of the current Sect Master looked utterly ridiculous.

On one hand it was because Ye Xijun herself possessed exalted virtue and great esteem; on the other hand, it was because the present Sect Master had taken the position through plotting—an act of betraying teacher and ancestors that earned universal scorn!

In terms of righteousness and ancestral precepts, the current Sect Master could not stand his ground.

He sized up the situation and realized that even if he surrendered now it would be pointless; he feared that after Ye Xijun dealt with the current Sect Master, he would be next on the chopping block.

So he would not submit!

“Obstinately stubborn!” Yang Xiuzhu rose slowly, his eyes cold as a blade as he fixed Bai Xi with a frigid stare, his gaze overflowing with killing intent.

In that instant Lin Yurao and Chu Hanyi moved as well; without any visible motion they suddenly appeared at Bai Xi’s sides, flanking him and closing off any route of escape.

“Bai Xi, you may end your cultivation yourself—our ancestral precepts forbid Star Emperor Mountain disciples from slaughtering one another; in light of our long years as fellow disciples, I’ll give you a chance to settle this yourself!” Yang Xiuzhu said coldly as he looked at Bai Xi.

“You want me to sever my cultivation?” Bai Xi laughed heartily. “Yang Xiuzhu, are you half-asleep? Since our ancestral rules forbid internecine slaughter, I’d like to see what you can do to me!”

He carried himself with a cocky air, clearly overconfident.

Yang Xiuzhu’s brow tightened; his expression grew grim.

In recent days he had agreed that even if Yang Kai succeeded he would not take part in the bloodshed—would not soil his hands with fellow disciples’ blood—because of that ancestral precept. Bai Xi’s shameless act now put him in a very difficult position.

“Star Emperor Mountain disciples truly must not slaughter one another, but I am now the Great Elder of the Lingxiao Sect; dealing with you would not be a problem,” Ye Xijun said with a cold snort, extending a delicate jade palm. She pressed down lightly; the palm seemed ethereal, as if it bore no trace of mortal smoke and dust.

Bai Xi, however, braced as if facing a great foe; his eyes bulged, his Saint Yuan spun wildly, and an imposing Shi burst from him as he raised both hands skyward to meet the attack.

Crackling sounds—

An inaudible shattering exploded deep within his spirit; Bai Xi was struck as if by lightning, his body convulsed and he staggered back several steps, coughing up a spray of blood, staring at Ye Xijun in disbelief: “Your Shi has reached maturity!”

At those words, everyone’s eyes lit up; they stared at Ye Xijun in stunned astonishment.

Only when a martial artist rises to the Origin Returning Realm can they comprehend the power of Shi. And only when one cultivates their Shi to perfection are they qualified to ascend to the Void King Realm.

This was an essential condition; otherwise, no matter how much a practitioner at the Origin Returning Realm cultivated, they could not touch the threshold of the Void King Realm.

The Dark Star was crawling with Origin Returning Realm practitioners. On Kaiyun Peak alone there were over one hundred and fifty such practitioners, yet none had cultivated their Shi to perfection—not even Yang Xiuzhu and the other two felt their Shi possessed that final, elusive refinement.

It was a height they could not reach.

And yet now, they were seeing true, perfected Shi!

When Ye Xijun struck, it was silent and formless, yet imbued with the power of Shi; everyone could feel it clearly—this force instantly shattered Bai Xi’s defenses and wounded him!

Though both were Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioners, the gap between Ye Xijun and Bai Xi was plain for all to see.

Still, Yang Xiuzhu and the others felt that Ye Xijun’s Shi differed in some way from what they had understood.

“Fools—do you think I used Shi?” Ye Xijun snorted. After her strike she did not press the attack; she only looked down with a disdainful expression.

“Not Shi…” Bai Xi’s mind raced; he was soon seized by horror, pointing at Ye Xijun and muttering in shock, “Could it be that you…”

“Domain!” Yang Xiuzhu barked, his eyes suddenly blazing with terrible light and his body trembling with excitement.

He finally understood why Ye Xijun’s Shi felt different from what he knew.

He recalled some of the ancient secrets recorded in old texts.

Rumor had it that when Shi was cultivated to perfection, one could comprehend the mysteries of Domain—a power that only Void King Realm practitioners could normally wield, vastly stronger than Shi.

A Domain!

This was a height Dark Star practitioners could never hope to reach.

Could the Sect Master have already attained such a realm? But looking at Ye Xijun, she was plainly a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm practitioner; this could only mean one thing.

It meant Ye Xijun’s cultivation had been pushed to its ultimate limit; she already qualified to ascend to the Void King Realm, but was suppressed by Dark Star’s heavenly laws and could not break through.

What a miserable circumstance! Yang Xiuzhu lamented, clenching his hand over his heart.

Even living on the Dark Star, Yang Xiuzhu knew that in other stars of the Star Domain Void King Realm experts were extremely rare—each one a figure of thunderous renown. The Sect Master had such opportunity and talent but was born into the wrong land; the Dark Star had become the cage that bound her wings!

“The former Sect Master was truly a once-in-ten-thousand-year genius—my respect!” Bai Xi said, clutching his chest and snarling. “But so what? Though I am weaker than you, if you try to kill me you will pay a price!”

As he finished speaking, Bai Xi twirled his wrist and a bead the size of a dragon’s eye suddenly appeared in his palm.

The power of Imperial Might spread out!

Everyone’s faces changed drastically.

“Extinction Thunder Bead!” Ye Xijun narrowed her phoenix eyes. “Is that what you’re relying on?”

“So what if it is?” Bai Xi laughed. “I know the former Sect Master is formidable. But can you withstand an Imperial Treasure’s strike? If I die, you’ll be buried with me. Why not sit down and talk—find a compromise to end this strife?”

“I don’t think so!”

A cold voice answered from not far away.

The voice was utterly unfamiliar; almost no one present had heard it before. All eyes turned toward the sound to see a youth in snug combat attire approaching at an unhurried pace, a mocking smile playing on his face.

“Yang Kai!” Bai Xi’s eyes narrowed as he shouted.

Many Star Emperor Mountain cultivators wore strange expressions.

Who was Yang Kai? Most of them did not know. After all, they had not even heard of Ye Xijun’s return; how could they know of Yang Kai’s existence?

Seeing this youth, who was only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, swagger onto Star Emperor Mountain caused some bewilderment.

But with the situation tense, these people weren’t fools; they assumed Yang Kai had come with Ye Xijun and said little, merely eyeing him curiously—unsure why he showed no fear of an Imperial Treasure.

After all, that was a secret treasure even Ye Xijun might not be able to block.

“You’re just waving that thing to scare people,” Yang Kai sneered, contempt plain on his face. “Old man, if you’ve got the guts, unleash the bead’s power and see if you can take me down. Maybe you’ll kill me or the Great Elder—then you won’t have lost out. But… do you have the guts?”

Bai Xi’s face sank; he glared at Yang Kai with a feral snarl and growled, “Boy, don’t push me too far.”

“Push you too far?” Yang Kai chuckled and scratched his nose. “Isn’t it you who’s out of touch? This Sect Master is standing right there. If you’ve got the guts, unleash the bead’s power—see if I can dodge. If I don’t, I die and you die; if I do, I live and you die. Which do you choose?”

Bai Xi’s face turned a new shade of pallor as he clutched the Imperial Treasure, afraid to make any rash move.

No matter what he chose, the outcome would be grim, which left him in a tormenting dilemma.

“Of course, there’s a third option,” Yang Kai grinned, his smile dazzling as he bared a row of white, wicked teeth.

“What?” Bai Xi asked, intrigued.

“Give me the Imperial Treasure and I’ll spare you.”

“You must be out of your mind!” Bai Xi shouted.

On the Dark Star, Void King-Grade secret treasures are extraordinarily rare—each is the ancestral treasure of some great sect; an Imperial Treasure is that level of relic. Having glimpsed its might, Bai Xi could not fathom giving it up.

Moreover, he would never trust Yang Kai’s smooth words—he feared that the moment he handed over the Imperial Treasure, it would be the moment he lay dead.

“Then don’t blame this Sect Master if I get ruthless!” Yang Kai’s patience snapped; he barked, “Come out!”

At his shout, the sky suddenly roiled, clouds churning; in moments a jet-black warship more than ten zhang long appeared there with an eerie presence.

It seemed the warship had been hovering there unseen the whole time.

A burst of astonished cries swept over Kaiyun Peak; everyone wore expressions of disbelief.

With so many practitioners here—most of them at the Origin Returning Realm—how could no one have noticed the warship’s concealment? The fact it had been hidden was enough to horrify them. Had it not revealed itself, the crowd would have remained unaware.

Moreover, the warship was not ordinary; it was beyond comparison—apparently a Void King-Grade Warship!

The entire assembly was stunned!
