## Chapter 120 — The Wrath of Meng Wuya

There, the area was covered with numerous forbidden seals. The disciples hurriedly reported this discovery.

Upon receiving the news, Hu Man rushed down personally to investigate, but he could neither comprehend nor decipher these seals.

Within the Blood Battle Gang, Long Zaitian was the eldest and most experienced. Having already been informed of the situation, Hu Man entrusted him to lead the effort in breaking these seals to uncover what secrets lay hidden within.

Hu Man had a strong intuition that the secrets concealed by these seals were extraordinary. If the Blood Battle Gang could obtain them, their strength would undoubtedly soar to a new level. Even if they could not rival the long-established Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, they would at least stand on equal footing with other first-rate powers.

Yet, Hu Man was somewhat vexed. Hu Mei’er had repeatedly emphasized the utmost importance of secrecy regarding this matter, but he had not taken it seriously, resulting in the entire gang’s upper echelons becoming aware.

After returning from the mining area that day, Hu Man hurried to find Hu Mei’er, hoping to learn how she had discovered the secret beneath the mines.

To his surprise, Hu Mei’er and he had a fierce quarrel over the matter. During the heated exchange, Hu Man learned that his youngest daughter had been guided by a master—a high-level figure who had revealed the secret beneath the mining area to her.

However, due to his own negligence, his daughter had failed to honor that master’s trust. That master was not keen on the Long family learning of this secret.

“Daughter, what kind of master was this?” Hu Man asked with solemn respect. To discern a secret buried dozens of zhang underground at a glance, this master’s strength must be extraordinary.

In Hu Man’s imagination, this person must possess earth-shattering, ghost-weeping power.

“What kind of master?” At that moment, Hu Mei’er’s mind flashed with the image of Yang Kai, her face slightly flushed. She shot her father a glare. “I won’t tell you!”

Seeing her demeanor, Hu Man was startled and wondered if his daughter had feelings for this master.

After some indirect probing, Hu Man was shocked.

This master was actually a young man not much older than himself. How could such a person come from a humble background?

“Daughter, have you fallen for him?” Hu Man asked eagerly. In his view, a daughter must marry eventually, but whom she married was crucial. If she could marry into one of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, it would be ideal, and the Blood Battle Gang would soar like a phoenix.

But this discerning young man was certainly no ordinary person.

“So what if I like him?” Hu Mei’er sighed softly.

“If you like him, then get closer to him. My daughter is so beautiful; could he not appreciate that?” Hu Man encouraged. “Or does he already have a wife? That’s nothing—men having multiple wives is normal.”

Hu Mei’er turned away and glared at him. “Because of you, I have failed that master’s trust. How can I face him again? Hmph!”

Hu Man could only laugh awkwardly. Little did he know that his daughter’s words were true. Had he known, he would never have shared this secret.

One must admit, Hu Man had completely misunderstood Yang Kai. If he had known that the master he revered was merely a trial disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, he would have urged Hu Mei’er to avoid him at all costs, never encouraging her to get close.

Snapping back to reality, Hu Man sighed deeply. This matter was truly distressing. His youngest daughter had been secluded in cultivation these days, no longer wandering about as before. Her strength had improved significantly, but without approaching that young man, how could she have a chance to marry him?

Below, a group of hall masters and ship masters were still flattering him, but to Hu Man’s ears, it was like chewing wax—utterly tasteless.

Just as he was about to rise and leave, Hu Man suddenly paused, then abruptly raised his head and looked toward the door, his face clouded with a grave expression.

The hall masters and ship masters immediately fell silent and turned their heads in unison.

An invisible pressure descended like the heavens themselves pressing down, causing everyone’s hearts to tremble.

A formidable expert had arrived at the Blood Battle Gang! Everyone in the council hall sensed the presence of the newcomer.

Then, a somewhat aged voice echoed beside them: “Where is Long Zaitian?”

The voice was calm, betraying no emotion, yet everyone involuntarily shivered. They sensed that this sudden arrival was not benevolent.

Looking for Deputy Leader Long? The group exchanged glances, puzzled.

“Come with me and see.” Hu Man rose and strode outside, followed closely by the hall masters and ship masters.

Outside, they immediately saw an elderly man standing motionless in midair. His hair and beard were pure white, his face as calm as still water, and his sharp eyes swept over them like a hawk surveying the land, radiating an arrogant and unrestrained aura.

Under that gaze, all felt insignificant.

“Peak Divine Roaming Realm!” Hu Man whispered, his rugged face twitching slightly.

“Peak Divine Roaming Realm?” Someone exclaimed in shock. “Could he be the master of Lingxiao Pavilion?”

Within a thousand li radius, there were several Divine Roaming Realm experts, but only the elusive master of Lingxiao Pavilion had reached the peak of that realm.

The newcomer’s age matched the rumors of the Lingxiao Pavilion master, explaining the confusion.

“No, he isn’t.” Hu Man shook his head slowly. He had met the Lingxiao Pavilion master once in his youth and clearly remembered his appearance, which was entirely different from this old man.

Moreover, although this man was at the peak Divine Roaming Realm, the pressure he exerted far exceeded that level.

Hu Man himself possessed strength at Divine Roaming Realm, seventh stage. Even if the Lingxiao Pavilion master had come personally, he would not feel such overwhelming oppression.

This old man was different. Looking at him was like facing an insurmountable mountain or an uncrossable river. No matter how much effort Hu Man expended in his lifetime, he could only look up in awe.

The feeling was eerie, but Hu Man trusted his instincts.

This old man was invincible. He could not be challenged!

Where had this expert come from? Hu Man’s face darkened as he stepped forward, clasping his fists respectfully: “May I ask your honorable name, venerable sir?”

The newcomer was none other than Meng Wuya. His pent-up fury had been simmering for quite some time. Upon returning to Lingxiao Pavilion, he had intended to confront Long Zaitian but feared his disciple might secretly seek out Yang Kai. So he waited two days to confirm she was truly in seclusion before making his appearance.

“Are you Long Zaitian?” Meng Wuya narrowed his hawk-like eyes, fixing them on Hu Man.

Hu Man’s Yuan Qi involuntarily surged, as if facing a life-threatening moment, yet he remained composed. After all, he was the gang leader; if he were intimidated by a single question, it would be disgraceful.

“I am Hu Man, leader of the Blood Battle Gang. May I ask, venerable sir—”

Before Hu Man could finish, Meng Wuya interrupted impatiently, “If you’re not Long Zaitian, why are you butting in?”

Hu Man felt bitter but dared not lose his temper. Just as he was about to explain, Meng Wuya erupted.

“Damn you, Long Zaitian! I curse your ancestors for eighteen generations! Come out now!” 

His roar was earth-shattering, sky-splitting, reverberating through the clouds and shaking the land. Everyone in the Blood Battle Gang, as well as those in Fengyu Tower and Lingxiao Pavilion, heard it clearly.

After the shout, silence fell.

A group of Divine Roaming and True Yuan Realm experts stared blankly at Meng Wuya, dumbfounded and speechless.

They never expected such a majestic expert to curse so crudely and viciously.

Where was his dignity? His status? Any expert with even a shred of strength or prestige would never demean themselves so.

What grudge could be so deep to make him abandon all cultivation and decorum? Had Long Zaitian stolen his chicken or dog to provoke such wrath?

Yet Meng Wuya’s shout made it clear to all present that the visitor was indeed hostile.

Hu Man’s face darkened. “Venerable sir, can we speak calmly?”

Though the visitor was powerful, Hu Man did not wish to provoke conflict. But Long Zaitian was still the gang’s deputy leader, and Meng Wuya’s outburst implicated him as well.

“I said, damn it! Tell Long Zaitian to come out! If he doesn’t show up today to have his head cut off and used as my chamber pot, I’ll slaughter your Blood Battle Gang!” Meng Wuya’s fierce challenge left no room for negotiation.

He truly did not regard the Blood Battle Gang.

A murderous gleam appeared on Hu Man’s face. Even clay has some heat, let alone Hu Man’s naturally fiery temper. Were it not for Meng Wuya’s strength, he would not be so conciliatory.

But Meng Wuya showed no respect. Hu Man was genuinely angered.

“Heh heh, is Long Zaitian a coward who dares not face me?” Meng Wuya sneered, casting a contemptuous glance downward.

This time, a young man responded coldly, “Sir, please watch your words. What grievance do you have with my grandfather to insult him so?”

The speaker was none other than Long Jun.

Meng Wuya had just arrived and insulted Long Zaitian with vile language. As a member of the Long family, Long Jun could not tolerate it. Relying on the many experts present at the Blood Battle Gang headquarters, he retorted sharply.

“Peak Divine Roaming Realm or not, the Blood Battle Gang has Divine Roaming experts too. If you dare to make a move here, you will not return!”

“Your grandfather?” Meng Wuya narrowed his eyes, staring at Long Jun.

“The person you seek is indeed my grandfather!” Long Jun replied solemnly.

“Very well!” Meng Wuya laughed. “Dragon begets dragon, phoenix begets phoenix, mice beget pups that know how to burrow. Long Hui is no good, and since you are his elder brother, you are no good either!”

Why drag Long Hui into this? Everyone suddenly felt this old man was somewhat unhinged, rambling incoherently without clear intent.

Long Jun growled, “Old curmudgeon, don’t be so arrogant. This is the Blood Battle Gang; you have no right to run wild here!”
