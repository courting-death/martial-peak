## Chapter 1750 — Confrontation

Yang Kai drew a deep breath, pondered for a moment, and said, “I need to think this over.”

“That is only natural. There is still time; please, Young Brother, deliberate carefully and then give me your answer.”

That Luo Lan spoke in this way already showed considerable sincerity.

Yang Kai spoke seriously, “Very well, then please stay here a few days, Elder; I will tell you after three days.”

“Then I shall await good news. If I can obtain your assistance, I believe this trip will be considerably safer for me.”

……

Three days later, Yang Kai and Luo Lan departed Twin Shark Island and set off towards Qingmu Palace.

To be honest, the Ethereal Crystal that Luo Lan had mentioned, born within the spatial rifts, did not greatly entice Yang Kai; though rare, he could gather them by visiting more Cultivation Stars.

With the resources and wealth he currently possessed, he could buy a great many Ethereal Crystals; it would only cost him more time.

What truly attracted Yang Kai, however, was the Jingkong Beast that could traverse the void!

This ancient strange beast moved through the void and drifted among the spatial rifts; its Inner Core greatly aided the cultivation of Spatial Force. Yang Kai’s Spatial Force cultivation had already reached a bottleneck; opening the domain of the Xuan Realm Pearl had become exceedingly slow, but if he could obtain the Jingkong Beast’s Inner Core and use it as the primary material to refine a Spiritual Pill, it would allow a qualitative leap in his command of Spatial Force.

Since no Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert had entered that Lost Realm, Yang Kai had little cause for worry.

He had some confidence he could escape from opponents at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

Thus, after three days of consideration, he agreed to Luo Lan’s request and decided to accompany her into the Lost Realm.

Before leaving, Yang Kai gave Yue Xi and her two disciples a long set of instructions, ordering them to stay behind at the temporary palace and telling them that if any martial artists bearing a token engraved with the character 'Ling' appeared, they should not panic, for they would be people of the Lingxiao Sect and were to be received properly.

Yue Xi and her two disciples listened in a daze and, unable to make much sense of why strangers might suddenly appear in the palace, did not ask further.

A few days later, Yang Kai and Luo Lan arrived at Qingmu Palace.

After arranging for Yang Kai to rest, Luo Lan began her preparations; she was to leave Qingmu Star and naturally had many affairs to hand over, and she needed to ensure all preparations were complete before entering the Lost Realm.

But these matters were not Yang Kai’s concern; he simply sat in his chamber and meditated.

Gu Jianxin was no longer there. According to Luo Lan, the Young Alliance Master of the Sword Alliance had departed a month after his arrival, and before leaving he had repeatedly instructed Luo Lan to take careful care of Yang Kai.

Time passed, and a month slipped by.

While meditating, Yang Kai felt Luo Lan’s Divine Sense summon him; he immediately ended his retreat and pushed the door open.

Outside, Luo Lan waited. When she saw him emerge she inclined her head slightly and led the way.

Outside Qingmu Palace, an Origin-Grade Middle-Level warship was already prepared; the two entered it, and before long the vessel began to make its way into the Star Domain.

“The Lost Realm lies somewhere within the Star Domain, its entrance wrapped in countless spatial rifts; ordinarily it cannot be entered. Only when the fluctuations of those rifts stabilize slightly will the entrance open. At that time it may require several Void King Realm experts to jointly perform a secret ritual. We will go and wait; when the time is right we can enter,” Luo Lan explained as she led Yang Kai through the warship.

“Do you know all the Void King Realm experts who will enter?” Yang Kai asked.

“Some I know; some I’ve only heard of. I don’t know exactly who will go this time—the timing of each expedition into the Lost Realm is uncertain—so only those who received the notice and hope to make breakthroughs will risk entering.” Luo Lan stopped before a cabin and said, “You will stay here for now. If you need anything, just ask. It will take us about a month to reach that place.”

Yang Kai nodded and pushed the door open.

Inside the cabin he walked to the bed, sat cross‑legged, closed his eyes, and regulated his breath.

A month passed uneventfully; Yang Kai spent his time meditating, and during this period Luo Lan did not visit him, nor did other Sword Alliance martial artists bother him.

It was not until a month later that Yang Kai felt the warship slow to a halt.

Luo Lan’s voice summoned him in a timely fashion from outside, “Yang Kai.”

Yang Kai moved and was at the door in an instant; he opened it, inclined his head slightly to Luo Lan, and the two walked out.

The warship’s hatch opened and the two flared into streams of light and shot out.

After they departed, the warship set sail again and returned along its original route.

Standing in the void, Luo Lan glanced about to discern their position, then said, “Follow me.”

She then produced a Star Shuttle and led the way, Yang Kai following closely.

The two lights, one ahead and one behind, sped through the vast Star Domain like thunder.

Yang Kai remained silent, tailing Luo Lan and dodging the meteors and starry storms that pervaded the Starry Sky.

He did not know how long had passed when he suddenly noticed a patch of white brilliance ahead; looking up, at an indeterminate distance a round object floated in the void, radiating dazzling light.

Even from so far away, Yang Kai could sense the fluctuations of Spatial Force emanating from that place.

“That is…” Yang Kai turned to look at Luo Lan.

“That is the entrance,” Luo Lan relaxed when she saw the scene ahead. “It seems we arrived early; the entrance has not stabilized and cannot be opened yet.”

“The Spatial Force fluctuations are chaotic…” Yang Kai murmured to himself.

“You can sense them?” Luo Lan asked in surprise.

“You already know I’m versed in Spatial Force; why would you think I couldn’t sense them?” Yang Kai let out a light laugh.

Luo Lan’s eyes brightened. “Bringing you was indeed a wise choice. At this distance I can only feel that it is dangerous; even a Third Stage of the Void King Realm attempting to force entry would likely be ground to pieces. As for specifics I know nothing. But Yang Kai, you must remember not to expose this advantage in front of others, otherwise…”

“I know.” Yang Kai cut her off; the saying that an innocent man with a treasure invites suspicion was not lost on him. If this advantage were truly exposed, he feared all Void King Realm experts would set their sights on him.

Luo Lan inclined her head slightly and the two continued to race forward.

The closer they drew to the entrance, the clearer Yang Kai’s perception became, and a hint of excitement appeared in his eyes. He had come primarily for the Jingkong Beast’s Inner Core, but upon just arriving he had already gained something.

Others could only sense the danger at the entrance, but Yang Kai could glean the essence of Spatial Force from it; those chaotic fluctuations fed his absorption and comprehension, causing his understanding of Spatial Force to harmonize with his own concepts, and he could not help but feel a flash of enlightenment.

After several hours the two had arrived not far from the entrance.

Observed up close, the entrance was about five li across, emitting pure white brilliance, but within it black spatial rifts occasionally darted about like fish, nimble and lively.

These roaming spatial rifts prevented anyone from passing through the entrance and formed the most dangerous layer of defense.

Near the entrance figures already stood in the void, not many—only seven or eight. These people had evidently arrived earlier; most were alone, some in pairs, but the numbers were small.

Yang Kai did not dare probe recklessly, but a casual glance told him these people were basically all Void King Realm experts!

They stood scattered, showing they hailed from different factions and had no intention of cooperating. Some sat with eyes closed to cultivate, others glanced around; their attire varied widely.

When Luo Lan and Yang Kai revealed themselves, all eyes were immediately drawn to them.

“Elder Luo dares to come to such a place?” A thin, sharp voice came from not far on the left, with a trace of insolence in its tone.

Luo Lan frowned at the words, looked toward the voice, her expression shifting slightly, and said in a low voice, “So it is Elder Cui. What, just because Elder Cui can come here, you think I cannot?”

The martial artist surnamed Cui laughed heartily. “This Cui certainly did not mean it like that, only… the Lost Realm is extremely perilous. Elder Luo herself takes such risks—aren’t you afraid you might fall within?”

“Do not trouble yourself; Elder Cui should look after himself,” Luo Lan replied with some impatience.

The two immediately squared off as if old grievances existed between them, and from their familiar forms of address it was clear they were acquainted. Yang Kai stood by Luo Lan, watching their expressions and remaining silent while he surreptitiously pondered.

Elder Cui, put in a verbal corner by Luo Lan, did not take offense; he chuckled and said, “Elder Luo, though there may be misunderstandings between us, we are after all both elders of the Sword Alliance. Since we are here, why not join forces? That way our safety would be better guaranteed.”

“I accept Elder Cui’s goodwill, Elder Luo understands, but… I am not alone this time. Elder Cui should invite others instead,” Luo Lan replied coolly, rejecting his proposal.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted; he then realized that Elder Cui was apparently also an elder of the Sword Alliance.

It seemed the other party was likely aligned with the faction of the Vice Alliance Master; otherwise Luo Lan would not have been so cold toward him.

That cultivator surnamed Cui stared thoughtfully at Yang Kai, his gaze sharp and venomous like a serpent’s. As his eyelids flickered, he said, “Who is this boy to Elder Luo? How is it that this old man has never seen him before? Elder Luo brought him here—could it be that she hopes he’ll gain something within the Lost Realm, or perhaps expects him to break through to the Void King Realm inside?”
