## Chapter 196 — Seizing the Yang Liquid

A few days ago, while passing through a perilous area, Yang Kai sensed the presence of a Yang attribute treasure. However, since that location was marked specifically on the map, he did not dare to approach it.

Now, it seemed he had no choice but to make the trip. The entire Hidden Island had been stripped of its Yang attribute items, and to gather four hundred drops of Yang Liquid, there was nowhere else to go but that place.

He just didn’t know what kind of Demonic Beasts were guarding it.

He had to be cautious; if he encountered the two giant eagles he had seen a few days ago, even with the Wings of Yang Flame, he would not be able to escape their pursuit.

After spending a day, he arrived at the outskirts of that perilous area.

Yang Kai pondered for a long time before ordering the strange insects to prepare defenses. He carefully considered every possible scenario and response method. Only after formulating a plan did he set off.

The Yang Source Seal on his chest once again emitted a scorching reaction. Indeed, several hundred zhang ahead, there was something with a Yang attribute, and its quality was not low. If there was enough energy, he could refine four hundred drops of Yang Liquid from it.

Whether he succeeded or failed depended on this adventure. At this moment, Yang Kai felt no fear as he walked step by step toward the direction indicated by the Yang Source Seal.

The air seemed to carry a faint scent of blood, and traces of Demonic Beasts were evident around him, indicating that immense danger lay ahead.

As he moved forward another hundred zhang, the scent intensified. Yang Kai vaguely saw a massive dark red rock standing not far ahead.

The Yang energy sensed by the Yang Source Seal was emanating from this stone.

Yang Kai’s heart leaped with joy. He felt that returning home was within reach. If he could absorb all the Yang energy from such a large Yang attribute exotic stone, obtaining four hundred drops of Yang Liquid would be a breeze. This stone should be somewhat similar to the Yang Flame Stone mined by the Blood Battle Gang, but its quality was far superior.

Continuing to approach cautiously, Yang Kai noticed a not-so-deep cave at the base of the rock. Inside the cave, a majestic Demonic Beast was squinting its purple eyes, staring intently at him.

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat; he never expected his presence to be exposed so easily.

However, the Demonic Beast did not seem inclined to chase him. It merely lay in the cave, eyeing him with ill intent.

This was its lair, the source of its strength and survival. It would not leave unless absolutely necessary.

After moving forward another thirty zhang, the Demonic Beast let out a low, intimidating growl, and a fierce light flickered in its purple eyes.

It slowly stood up and stepped out of the cave.

Only at this moment did Yang Kai see its true form. It was a wolf-like Demonic Beast, but its fur was dark red, standing about two zhang tall, with fangs as sharp as blades, baring them at Yang Kai.

An invisible pressure descended. Yang Kai felt as though he could hardly breathe.

A sixth-tier Demonic Beast! It was definitely a sixth-tier Demonic Beast, not much weaker than the giant eagles he had encountered before. Even with all his strength, Yang Kai knew he could not kill it.

Bending down slowly, Yang Kai picked up a stone from the ground while remaining vigilant of the beast’s movements.

Then, with all his might, he threw the stone at the Demonic Beast.

This blatant provocation thoroughly enraged the dark red wolf demon. Yang Kai saw a flash of red light, and the beast had already appeared thirty zhang away from him.

So fast! Yang Kai’s expression darkened. Without a moment’s hesitation, he turned and activated his movement technique to retreat rapidly.

A whistling wind sound came from behind him. The Demonic Beast was closing in quickly, causing Yang Kai’s hair to stand on end. A chill ran down his spine as he pushed his speed to the limit, darting away.

“Master, this is bad! It’s about to catch up to you!” Di Mo exclaimed in panic.

“Help me!” Yang Kai dared not let his guard down and continued to flee forward. Di Mo responded, wrapping around the Soul-Breaking Spike and transforming into a black mist to pounce at the wolf demon.

The Demonic Beast reacted swiftly, opening its mouth mid-run and biting down on the Soul-Breaking Spike.

Di Mo let out a terrified scream, but the wolf demon couldn’t break the spike; it found the object too hard to chew and spat it out.

Di Mo was left shaken.

This delay allowed Yang Kai to gain some distance.

After flying forward about a hundred zhang, he finally reached the position he had previously set up. Yang Kai stopped fleeing and turned to face the Demonic Beast, which was charging at him like a shadow, its fangs glinting ominously in the air.

With a quick sidestep, Yang Kai dodged to a distance of several zhang.

Before he could steady himself, the wolf demon lunged at him again. Its speed was not much slower than that of the Heaven-Devouring Insect he had encountered before. Yang Kai felt an immediate drop in pressure and activated his movement technique to engage in a cat-and-mouse game with it.

At this moment, Di Mo finally arrived, assisting Yang Kai by distracting the wolf demon, slightly alleviating Yang Kai’s precarious situation.

The two of them, one human and one demon, dashed around within a radius of several dozen zhang, narrowly avoiding the wolf demon’s pounces multiple times, always escaping at the last moment. Even so, Yang Kai was drenched in sweat.

Facing a sixth-tier Demonic Beast with his Qi Movement Ninth Stage strength was indeed overestimating his capabilities. Without his self-created movement technique, he would have been killed without even a chance to react.

But to leave the Hidden Island, Yang Kai had no choice but to take risks.

After circling for a full incense stick of time, Yang Kai glanced around and finally revealed a faint smile. The Wings of Yang Flame unfurled behind him, and he soared into the sky.

“Di Mo, you distract it with those insects; I’m leaving!” Yang Kai instructed, turning toward the large stone.

“Master, hurry! I’m really afraid it will swallow me whole!” Di Mo said anxiously. Although it was hiding within the Soul-Breaking Spike and was not in immediate danger, the thought of being swallowed was still terrifying.

The Demonic Beast fixed its gaze on the direction Yang Kai was fleeing, seemingly sensing his intention to invade its lair. It let out a furious roar and charged after him.

However, it had barely run a short distance before it plunged into a thick mist.

A series of light sounds echoed, and the wolf demon let out a miserable howl, hurriedly retreating while warily staring at the white mist before it.

This mist did not disappoint Yang Kai’s expectations; even a sixth-tier Demonic Beast could not freely enter or exit. Its powerful corrosive properties were enough to hinder its movements.

The wolf demon was clever enough to realize the mist was deadly. It quickly changed direction, attempting to break through from another side. However, after making a large circle, it discovered that this area, spanning several dozen zhang, had been enveloped by mist, leaving it with no way to escape.

This was Yang Kai’s prior setup, having instructed the large insects to spew out a wide circle of mist, deliberately leaving a gap to lure the wolf demon inside, then sealing the gap, allowing him to use the Wings of Yang Flame to leave safely.

From start to finish, he had never intended to kill the powerful sixth-tier Demonic Beast, nor did he have the ability to do so; he only sought to trap it.

Rustling sounds echoed from below, sending chills down one’s spine as the ground erupted. Countless strange insects emerged, attacking the wolf demon fearlessly.

The wolf demon roared in fury, flames erupting from its body, causing the insects to fall to the ground before they could get close.

Di Mo dared not approach, flitting about to distract the wolf demon’s attention.

Meanwhile, Yang Kai had flown to the large stone, placing his hands on it and frantically operating the True Yang Technique, drawing the Yang energy from the stone into his body.

The Yang attribute energy contained in this large stone was indeed much better than that of the Yang Flame Stone. No wonder the wolf demon cultivated here; this kind of stone was immensely beneficial to it.

The surging Yang attribute energy surged into his body, causing his meridians to swell almost instantly.

Drip…

A drop of Yang Liquid formed and fell into his Dantian.

Drip, drip…

Yang Kai felt he had never heard such a delightful sound in his life. The Yang Liquid in his Dantian was increasing at the rate of nearly one drop per breath.

Three hundred twenty drops, three hundred fifty drops, three hundred eighty drops…

In just a short while, Yang Kai had already achieved his target. Almost one-tenth of the Yang attribute energy from the large stone had been drained.

But Yang Kai did not stop; he continued to operate the True Yang Technique.

The wolf demon’s howls echoed, filled with anger and killing intent. After all, it was a sixth-tier Demonic Beast, and Yang Kai did not know how long the mist would hold it back. If it decided to charge out regardless of its injuries, the strange insects would not be able to stop it.

After a moment, the Yang Liquid in his Dantian had exceeded five hundred drops. This amount was certainly enough to support his journey to Sea City.

At that moment, a black mist suddenly flew over; it was the Soul-Breaking Spike. Di Mo urged, “Master, hurry and escape! That beast is about to break free!”

Before the words had left his mouth, Yang Kai saw a fiery red figure rapidly approaching him; it had broken free.

The wolf demon was engulfed in raging flames, which were protecting it from the mist’s corrosive effects, only inflicting minor injuries.

One hundred zhang, eighty zhang, fifty zhang, thirty zhang…

The wolf demon’s speed was like the wind.

With a whoosh, the Wings of Yang Flame behind Yang Kai unfurled once more, and as the wolf demon lunged at him, he shot up into the sky.

Looking down, he saw the wolf demon staring at him with its purple eyes, continuously growling.

Yang Kai grinned, “Thanks! Actually, I didn’t use much of your Yang energy; I only took one-fifth. No need to hold a grudge!”

As if it understood Yang Kai’s words, the wolf demon was enraged by his attitude of taking advantage while pretending to be innocent, roaring incessantly.

Yang Kai did not wish to linger; maintaining the Wings of Yang Flame consumed energy. With a flap of his wings, he swiftly departed.

The wolf demon was smart enough to realize it could not catch a flying enemy, so it did not pursue.

Returning to the previous location, Yang Kai collected the treasures and led the surviving strange insects toward the solitary peak.

Two days later, Yang Kai finally arrived at the solitary peak. Entering the cave, he carefully retrieved the items from the stone rack. Although he did not dare to refine them recklessly, he would not leave them behind.

If used well, everything here could be a deadly weapon! Now that he had gathered enough Yang Liquid, it was time to leave the Hidden Island.
