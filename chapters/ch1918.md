## Chapter 1918 — We're All Family

"No!" Ai Ou said with a stern face, vetoing in one breath, "Other matters can be negotiated, but I do not agree to this!"

Xue Yue's expression darkened.

"Husband, you should think of Xue Yue as well — her standards are so high; how many in this world could win her favor? Do you really wish to see her spend the rest of her life lonely?" Gu Bihu coaxed in a soft, gentle voice.

"A warrior's heart, the Martial Dao is supreme; when the Martial Dao is perfected, carnal pleasures can wait!" Ai Ou still wore a stern face and did not relent.

Gu Bihu suddenly smiled faintly, an enchanting smile on her lips, and said with a pleased, teasing tone, "It seems... speaking nicely to you, this Madam will get me nowhere."

Hearing that, Ai Ou's face changed and he cried out, "Hey, Madam, what are you trying to do!"

"I'm not trying anything," Gu Bihu said with a light, cold laugh. "Chairman Ai Ou is a hero of his generation, holding the Commerce Guild's power and esteeming the Martial Dao above all — a little woman like me holds no status... You are still some distance from Martial Dao completion; since you say pleasures can wait until after your success, then this little woman must leave you so as not to interfere with your great cause."

As she spoke, Gu Bihu looked as if on the verge of tears, adopting a despondent expression about to take her leave; combined with her sickly pale beauty, she truly looked pitiable.

Ai Ou indeed panicked, hurried forward, pushed Yang Kai and Xue Yue aside, grabbed Gu Bihu's hands, and said anxiously, "Madam, I didn't mean that! I was only disciplining Xue Yue; I didn't say..."

"I understand your meaning," Gu Bihu said, reaching up to wipe the crystalline tears from her eyes. "Chairman, rest assured: this little woman will recuperate here for a few days, and once able to rise and move about, she will leave. I will not delay your Martial Dao cause. When you one day stand at the Martial Dao's peak, this little woman will return to accompany you. Not leaving, not abandoning."

She lightly bit her thin lip, tilted her head as if in unbearable pain, and as she spoke the tears streamed down.

"Madam..." Ai Ou was completely dumbfounded, not knowing what to say; anxious as if a cat scratching, he longed to kneel before Gu Bihu and beg forgiveness, but seeing Yang Kai and Xue Yue watching, how could he lose face?

He turned and glared angrily at Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

"Uh—Father, I will take my leave," Xue Yue understood the situation and, knowing the following scene was unsuitable for them, quickly tugged Yang Kai and fled.

Yang Kai hurriedly cupped his fist and followed Xue Yue out.

Before leaving, Yang Kai noticed Gu Bihu gave him a reassuring look as if to say, "Don't panic, I've got this."

Yang Kai grinned, knowing that although Ai Ou looked burly, he must be a man who valued feelings and loyalty; otherwise he would not care so much for Gu Bihu.

But then again, if one day Su Yan or Xia Ningshang or Shan Qingluo used this trick on him, he feared he would be unable to resist either.

The realm of tenderness is a hero’s tomb — an ageless truth.

They arrived at the bamboo hut to find Shen Tu gone without a trace. The hut's sealing formation had snapped shut in an instant; no sound issued from within, and even when Yang Kai silently sent out his Divine Sense to probe, he could not penetrate it.

He could only give up.

"Madam Gu..." Yang Kai thought for a moment, unsure which adjective was fitting — after all, Gu Bihu was now something of an elder to him. Any description felt inadequate; he could only say, "She seems to care for you deeply."

"Yes, Madam treats us all well and is personable, so we all respect her," Xue Yue said with a pursed smile. "Only she can keep Father in line. Don't be fooled by how obedient Father is before her; he is a different man in front of others."

"I can imagine," Yang Kai nodded. After all, he was a senior of his generation—how could he do without a bit of dignity and imposing presence?

Xue Yue suddenly poked Yang Kai and bluntly asked, "When do you intend to marry me?"

"Huh?" Yang Kai stared at Xue Yue, half-smiling and half-amused. "You're so sure Madam Gu can handle Chairman Ai Ou?"

"Madam has personally stepped in; how could Father not yield? Besides, even without Madam, given your status and cultivation, Father would give it much thought. So there is no other possibility."

"So you're so eager to give yourself away?" Yang Kai stared into Xue Yue's beautiful eyes.

Xue Yue blushed slightly and stamped her foot, "So what if I am? For someone as exceptional as you, if I don't take the initiative, what place would I have in your heart later?"

Yang Kai was stunned and left somewhat speechless.

Xue Yue snorted coldly, stepped forward, jabbed Yang Kai's chest, and said through gritted teeth, "Tell me — aside from that demoness Shan Qingluo I saw in the Imperial Garden before, how many other women are there, and what are their names?"

As she spoke a few words and jabbed Yang Kai, the delicate finger concealed a burst of Saint Yuan impact.

After a dozen pokes, Yang Kai couldn't help but cough lightly, feeling a bit guilty, "Really not many."

"Not many means how many?" Xue Yue asked with a sidelong glance.

Yang Kai raised two fingers.

"Who are they? Are they worthy of you?"

"My two Senior Sisters," Yang Kai laughed awkwardly.

"Childhood sweethearts, huh." Xue Yue was surprised, then annoyed. "No hope for the first house; second and third houses don't include me — must I be only the fourth wife?"

She grew unhappy and said through gritted teeth, "How many more do you plan to find in the future?"

"There won't be any more!" Yang Kai said solemnly.

Xue Yue gave a hollow, mocking laugh, her smile not touching her eyes. "Are you really so sure it's all right to say that? Be careful I don't find something to hold over you later—if I tell your three elder sisters, do you think you could handle it?"

"Truly no more," Yang Kai vowed earnestly, almost swearing an oath, looking sincerely at Xue Yue with clear, honest eyes. He took her soft hand and said warmly, "Having you is enough."

Xue Yue blushed slightly, sweetness filling her heart, and looked down, feigning scolding, "Cheesy!"

Done!

Yang Kai couldn't help wiping the cold sweat from his forehead!

While they were talking, the bamboo hut's door suddenly opened and the stout figure of Chairman Ai Ou strode out.

Xue Yue immediately looked like a startled rabbit, quickly pulling her hand from Yang Kai's and stepping back two paces.

Ai Ou's eyes were like thunder and lightning, staring straight at where the two stood; he had clearly noticed something but said nothing, merely snorted coldly, his old face stern, raised a hand in a beckoning gesture at Yang Kai, and said curtly, "Boy, come with me."

With that, he strode off in a certain direction.

From 'Brother Yang', to 'Master Yang', to 'boy'... it showed how Ai Ou's impression of Yang Kai had shifted in his mind.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, turned to Xue Yue, and said, "I'll go talk with the Senior; you go back for now, I'll come find you."

Xue Yue opened her mouth, intending to follow, but knowing it was inappropriate to interrupt two men, she could only say, "Be careful. If my father gives you trouble, endure it if you can; later, I... will make it up to you."

After saying this, she ran off with swift feet, her face flushed.

Yang Kai immediately wore a look of daydreaming.

"Boy, get over here!" Ai Ou stood not far off and impatiently urged.

"Coming, coming." Yang Kai knew he had been absolutely outmatched in his clash with Gu Bihu and that Ai Ou was in a bad mood, so he took it lightly.

He jogged over and stood before Ai Ou, smiling, cupped his fists, and said, "Yang Kai pays respects to my future... father-in-law!"

"What did you call me, boy?!" Ai Ou leaped up like a cat with its tail stepped on.

"Heh," Yang Kai forced a laugh.

"You can eat as you like, but you mustn't speak rashly. I'm telling you, boy: if you intend to marry Xue Yue, there's no negotiating!" Ai Ou glared at Yang Kai, his face full of displeasure.

"Truly no negotiation?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

"Absolutely not!" Ai Ou said, narrowing his eyes, his tone heavy, as if struck by heaven and thunder but refusing to yield.

"Is that so..." Yang Kai mused. "Then there's nothing much to discuss with you, Senior. Let's leave it at that; tomorrow I will leave Shuitian City."

"Huh?" Ai Ou was stunned; he had not expected Yang Kai to be so acquiescent. He had thought the boy would cling and pester, yet he backed down so readily.

Joy rose in Ai Ou's heart — if that were the case, he could give Gu Bihu an explanation. After all, it would not be that he forced Yang Kai to leave; Yang Kai was leaving voluntarily, so it had nothing to do with him.

He was about to speak when Yang Kai sighed heavily: "Ah, but if I leave here, I'm afraid the Medicine Master Hall's more than five hundred alchemists will leave with me."

"What do you mean?" Ai Ou immediately grew nervous.

"Heh, I forgot to tell you, Chairman Ai Ou: after you left I held a few days of open lectures on pillcraft, and now I am the half-master to those alchemists. They originally planned to follow me to learn alchemy, but I thought — we're all family; staying with me or remaining at the Medicine Master Hall is about the same, so I didn't agree to take them. But now that I have no fate with Xue Yue, I won't force it; if I leave, they're probably leaving too."

"Half-master?" Ai Ou was aghast, then angrily said, "Boy, you're threatening me!"

He knew Yang Kai was not joking; alchemists treasured their lineages. From Zhan Yuan following Zuo De and leaving, one could see this. Yang Kai was now the half-master of those more-than-five-hundred alchemists, and with his teaching debt, a single call from him would empty the Medicine Master Hall — not a single person would remain.

That was the elite force of the entire Hengluo Commerce Guild!

Ai Ou felt a chill in his heart, realizing he had somewhat underestimated Yang Kai's capabilities.

"How could I dare!" Yang Kai said with a smile.

"You've got nerve!" Ai Ou gritted his teeth and snorted.

Yang Kai paid him no mind, suddenly drew a stone tablet-like object from his Spatial Ring and sighed, "I had planned to present this to you, Senior—what a pity... well, it saves me the trouble now."

"What is it?" Ai Ou asked with curiosity.

"A cultivation manual!" Yang Kai smiled slightly.
