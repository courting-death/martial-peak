## Chapter 2238 — Tian Yan

"You need not worry about his safety. This old man will not harm him in the slightest. I merely need to borrow some of his strength for something." The old man patiently explained to Gao Xueting, then glanced at the palace and said, "Your disciples are still inside. Although their souls have not suffered much damage, they have been shaken. It’s best to take them away from here as soon as possible so they can rest and recover."

“Many thanks for the reminder, Senior!” Gao Xueting said hurriedly.

“Mm.” The old man nodded lightly, then turned his gaze to Yang Kai and said kindly, “Young friend, come with me!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand. Yang Kai immediately felt a gentle force envelop him, and he was involuntarily drawn to the old man’s side. He then followed, swiftly heading in a certain direction.

Gao Xueting opened her mouth, as if wanting to say something more, but the old man and Yang Kai were already gone. In the blink of an eye, they had disappeared without a trace.

Staring in the direction they vanished, Gao Xueting’s brows furrowed slightly.

She knew that with the old man’s unfathomable cultivation and strength, he had no need to lie to her. If he truly bore any ill will, he could crush her to dust with a single finger. Yet, the fact that he had taken Yang Kai away so abruptly still left her uneasy. She did not know what power the old man wished to borrow from Yang Kai, nor what he intended to do.

After thinking for a while, she realized she was powerless to resolve the matter and could not even track the old man’s whereabouts. All she could do was go to the palace, rescue Xia Sheng and the others, then use a secret technique to send a message to Wen Zishan so he could find a way to retrieve their Spirit Bodies from outside.

……

They sped along like the wind, the air roaring past Yang Kai’s ears as the ground blurred beneath them.

Yang Kai’s expression was solemn.

The old man beside him was the first Great Emperor-level expert he had ever encountered! Before this, he had only heard of such beings, never seen one in person.

Of course... perhaps Yang Yan could be considered a Great Emperor, but only possibly.

Even if Yang Yan was a Great Emperor, when she was with Yang Kai, her strength was not very high. Only after returning to the Star Realm would her cultivation gradually recover.

He had never truly witnessed the means of a Great Emperor.

But today, he finally fulfilled that long-held wish.

Granny You’s Third Stage of the Emperor Realm-level desperate strike was like a gentle breeze before this old man—utterly insignificant.

And now, as the old man traveled with Yang Kai, their speed was dozens of times faster than even Yang Kai’s own space teleportation...

Yang Kai could not even observe the scenery as they passed.

Deep inside, he was profoundly shaken. Only now did he understand the heights of a Great Emperor—simply unattainable for ordinary martial artists.

Along the way, Yang Kai remained silent, not asking what the old man wanted him to do, for it would be meaningless to ask now. When the time came, he would naturally find out.

The other party bore no hostility, so there was no need to think of escaping. He simply focused on sensing the Emperor Intent and Imperial Might radiating from the old man, tempering his own will in the process.

He did not speak, and the old man seemed disinclined to start a conversation either, merely hurrying along, his face occasionally showing a complex expression.

After about a day, the old man brought Yang Kai to a mountain valley.

Only upon arriving did the old man slow down.

Yang Kai looked around. He found the valley shrouded in thick mist. Inside, one could not see their own hand before their face, and this mist was clearly not ordinary. Even when he probed with his Divine Sense, it was as if it had sunk into the sea—completely vanished.

After a moment, the two landed on a flat area within the valley.

The gentle force that had been enveloping Yang Kai finally dissipated.

Regaining his freedom, Yang Kai looked around.

He quickly noticed that this seemed to be the only place in the valley not covered by mist. The area was not large; all he could see was a simple wooden hut, and in front of it, two or three dozen graves. In front of each grave stood a wooden tablet engraved with a name.

Yang Kai was startled.

Although he knew there could not be any corpses in these graves—perhaps nothing at all—he still felt as if many world-shaking figures were buried here.

His gaze swept over the names, but he did not recognize a single one.

The names were written in a flowing, powerful script. Each stroke, each line, seemed to contain the Dao itself, leaving him deeply shaken.

“How should I address you, young friend?” the old man suddenly asked, looking kindly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai quickly cupped his fists and introduced himself.

“So it is Young friend Yang. A pleasure, a pleasure!” The old man nodded slightly.

Yang Kai said solemnly, “May I ask Senior’s honored name?”

The old man was silent for a moment, then said, “This old one is Tian Yan!”

Yang Kai once again saluted respectfully.

After responding, Tian Yan pointed at the dozens of graves ahead and said, “Young friend Yang, do you know who these people are?”

Yang Kai replied solemnly, “Although I do not recognize any of their names, I know these Seniors must have been world-shaking figures, with peerless cultivation and abilities.”

“Heh heh...” Tian Yan smiled faintly. “That’s not a bad answer. But do you know... how they died?”

Yang Kai shook his head in confusion.

In fact, he was pondering this very question. For someone as extraordinary as Tian Yan to guard this place, and for this simple hut to be his place of meditation, those buried here must have been no ordinary people.

For a Great Emperor like Tian Yan to guard these graves, the deceased must have been remarkable experts.

But... since none of those buried here were nameless figures, who could possibly have killed them? Could it be that Tian Yan himself took action? Yet, looking at the old man, Yang Kai felt he was not someone who delighted in slaughter.

Tian Yan said, “Long ago, this world was likewise flourishing in the Martial Dao. Experts at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm emerged one after another, the various sects and factions thrived, and a hundred schools contended…”

He did not answer the previous question, but instead began recalling the past.

Yang Kai did not dare interrupt, and quickly adopted a focused expression to listen.

“Back then, I was only at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, about the same as the woman you met today,” Tian Yan continued. Yang Kai knew he was referring to Granny You.

“Though this world is very different from the outside, since it exists, it has its own trajectory and laws. Many experts sought greater strength within these laws, coexisting in harmony...” Tian Yan’s eyes filled with reminiscence.

Hearing this, Yang Kai suddenly had a bad feeling, as if a dramatic twist was coming.

Sure enough, Tian Yan continued, “But the appearance of one thing changed everything!”

“What thing?” Yang Kai asked in shock. He truly could not imagine what could have turned the world upside down, causing the deaths of so many experts buried here.

In other words, that thing possessed the power to destroy an entire world!

Tian Yan glanced at him meaningfully and said unhurriedly, “A swarm of insects!”

Yang Kai’s expression changed. Suddenly, he recalled what Yi Quan had told him before and blurted out, “Soul-Devouring Worms?”

Back at Heavenly Yao Mountain, Yi Quan had told Yang Kai that this Divine Roaming Mirror world had nearly been destroyed by Soul-Devouring Worms. He warned him that if he ever entered the Divine Roaming world again, he must never bring the worms with him unless he could fully control them, and must never leave them behind when departing.

Yang Kai clearly remembered Yi Quan’s serious expression and solemn tone when he said this.

Combining Yi Quan’s words, Yang Kai suddenly realized what the old man was referring to.

"Exactly!" Tian Yan nodded gravely. "No one knows where those insects came from. At first, they were weak and few paid them any mind. But their nature and their hold over this world allowed them to grow rapidly through slaughter and devouring. Wherever they went, all living things perished, cries of misery filled the land. Any being with its own will was devoured, and no one could resist them..."

“One family after another was wiped out, one city after another was consumed. In just a few short years, their growth was unimaginable.” As Tian Yan spoke, a shadow crossed his eyes. “By the time the experts of this world realized the danger, the swarm had already grown beyond anyone’s ability to suppress!”

Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly.

As the master of the Soul-Devouring Worms, and someone who possessed such a swarm, Yang Kai understood better than anyone the dominion and lethality they held over this world.

He had even imagined that, given enough time, the Soul-Devouring Worms could become the rulers of this world.

But that was only a hypothesis. Yang Kai did not know if it would truly succeed. Yet from Tian Yan’s words, he learned that it had indeed happened before.

Even without witnessing it, Yang Kai could imagine the tragic scene—wherever the Soul-Devouring Worms passed, all was deathly silent, with no trace of life remaining.

"They were too powerful, and their dominion over the beings of this world was too great. They could even devour the souls of experts to strengthen themselves, growing ever stronger." Tian Yan took a deep breath and continued, "So at that time, nearly all the experts joined forces, for themselves and for this world, to fight a life-and-death battle against the Soul-Devouring Worms!"

Yang Kai’s blood inexplicably boiled. Although Tian Yan did not describe the battle, he could almost see dozens of Emperor Realm experts fighting fearlessly, unleashing their powers to besiege the Soul-Devouring Worms.

That battle must have shaken heaven and earth.

That battle must have dimmed the sun and moon.

That battle was destined... to be forgotten by the world.

Because after that battle... one expert after another became nothing but empty graves, with only their names left behind!
