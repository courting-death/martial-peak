## Chapter 2070 — Stirred Up a Hornet's Nest

Mo Xiaoqi heard this and, for a moment, seemed to come to understand; she looked at the Jiang Family with contempt and said, "Are you trying to use numbers to bully the few?"

Jiang Lin's face flushed awkwardly; he gave a light cough and said, "It wasn't intentional, miss, please don't blame us!"

“Family Head, what is the point of wasting words on her? Let us act together. If she dares resist, she cannot blame us for being ruthless,” a Jiang Family elder barked sharply.

“You are all utterly shameless—I am just a young girl!” Mo Xiaoqi cried out, her face full of wounded indignation.

“On the battlefield, who cares about young girls or grown women? If you must blame someone, blame that Yang Kai!” Jiang Chuhe seemed to harbor quite the grudge against Yang Kai, and that twisted resentment spilled onto Mo Xiaoqi as well, leaving him not the least bit courteous toward her.

Mo Xiaoqi's face grew furious; she ground her teeth and glared at Jiang Chuhe, saying, "Are you really going to attack me?"

Jiang Chuhe sneered coldly, "Ha — you think I'm joking with you?"

At that, he flipped his wrist and a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure longsword materialized in his hand; the blade shuddered as he thrust it toward Mo Xiaoqi.

In an instant the sword's cry rang out, Origin Qi appeared, and where the blade pointed, sword-flowers bloomed as if about to shroud Mo Xiaoqi's whole body.

A hint of playful amusement spread across Mo Xiaoqi's pretty face; she stood her ground and made no move to dodge, instead giving Jiang Chuhe a single glare before calmly producing an item and channeling Origin Qi into it.

With a soft puff, the secret treasure she invoked expanded serenely and enveloped her, sealing her inside without the slightest seam.

The treasure took the shape of a sphere, pale blue in color. Its surface shimmered like a sheet of water, clear as glass and as thin as a cicada's wing.

From outward appearances, Mo Xiaoqi now looked as if she were wrapped inside a water bubble.

That treasure was none other than the Weak Water Pearl she had once used on Yuqing Mountain!

The Weak Water Pearl could even imprison juvenile luanfeng, so its power was evident; Mo Xiaoqi now used the Pearl with deft skill, turning what was meant for confinement into a defensive Secret Treasure.

The effect was plainly not insignificant.

The moment the Secret Treasure appeared, Jiang Lin's eyes narrowed. He suddenly cried out, "Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure!"

At those words, the gazes of the Jiang Family's many elders burned hot.

Clang — Jiang Chuhe's sword struck the water curtain, yet unexpectedly his blow had no effect; it merely dented the seemingly fragile surface inward a fraction before it violently rebounded.

Moreover, the force of the attack seemed to be entirely reflected back onto Jiang Chuhe himself.

Caught off guard, the Jiang Family's rising prodigy failed to fully absorb the backlash and gave a startled cry as he stumbled backward several steps; his face paled and his expression turned terrified.

Fortunately he had not struck with full force just now, or that one blow alone might have left him badly wounded.

"This girl's background is likely extraordinary — don't hesitate, finish this quickly!" Jiang Lin lowered his eyes and ordered in a low voice.

If she were some run-of-the-mill Void King Realm cultivator, why would she unveil a Dao Origin–grade Secret Treasure the moment she acted — and a defensive one at that? The Jiang Family boasted many Void Kings, yet not a single one of them owned a Dao Origin–grade Secret Treasure.

Only those of distinguished origin and great backing could receive such gifts from their elders and thus hold one or two Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasures.

Earlier, when Jiang Chuhe struck, Jiang Lin had somewhat relied on his status and hesitated to act, not wanting to be accused of ganging up on the weak; but now that the situation had turned, there was no time for hesitation.

At his command he formed spirit seals and pointed a single hand forward.

With a soft ripping sound, a streak of light shot from his fingertip and slammed into the Weak Water Pearl's water curtain.

At the same time, the other elders of the Jiang Family also moved.

In an instant the radiance of various Martial Skill Secret Treasures blossomed, all striking toward Mo Xiaoqi.

But...

All the attacks fizzled out; the Weak Water Pearl that enveloped Mo Xiaoqi merely kept shifting its form, effortlessly nullifying each strike and, as if by some enchantment, miraculously flinging the assaults back.

Seeing this, the Jiang Family's Void King Realm fighters changed color and hurriedly evaded.

Mo Xiaoqi huddled inside the water curtain of the Weak Water Pearl, her pretty face growing long and as cold as frost. Gritting her teeth, she cried out in a petulant, fierce voice, "You actually dare to use numbers to bully the few? Shameless — I'll fight you!"

Like a child who had been bullied, Miss Mo suddenly threw a tantrum; no sooner had she spoken than she reached to slap the small cloth bags hanging at her waist.

Those little pouches bulged and swelled; no one knew what was inside, and even if the Jiang Family had noticed them earlier they paid them no heed.

But now, an eye-popping sight unfolded before them.

At Mo Xiaoqi's motion, one by one creatures of varied forms and sizes sprang from the pouches like deities descending; the first to appear was a majestic Silver-Maned Lion-Tiger Beast over six or seven zhang long.

The beast made a thunderous, awe-inspiring roar as it reared, its maw wide, fangs bared, frightening the Jiang Family members back several paces.

The beast displayed the full might of a peak Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast!

Next, the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat appeared, then the Red-Fire Qilin emerged. Soon after, an enormous jet-black jiao also manifested—its body more than a dozen zhang long, twin horns jutting from its brow, bearing faint traces of a true dragon’s form.

The giant Jiao coiled its body around Mo Xiaoqi, raising its head and chest proudly as it spouted a crimson, serpent-like essence; its pupils were a pale blue, eerie to the extreme.

"Blue-Eyed Ink-Scaled Jiao?" a discerning Jiang Family elder, the First Brother, cried out.

Stumbling back several steps, the Jiang Family cultivators stared in incredulous shock at those rare yet overwhelmingly powerful Demonic Beasts.

Leaving aside the small Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat, the Silver-Maned Lion-Tiger Beast, Red-Fire Qilin, and the Blue-Eyed Ink-Scaled Jiao were each almost extinct beasts; ordinary warriors outside would never have a chance to see them.

The reason these Demonic Beasts were nearly extinct was that they carried the bloodlines of ancient strange beasts; such bloodlines were exceedingly difficult to pass on, and over the course of time beasts bearing those lines became rarer until they were on the verge of extinction.

The reason the Jiang elder recognized the Blue-Eyed Ink-Scaled Jiao was that years ago he sought to cultivate a secret technique that required this Jiao's Essence-Blood; he had inquired many times but, regrettably, after more than ten years of searching had failed to find any trace and was forced to abandon that cultivation.

He had never expected that, after so many years, another Blue-Eyed Ink-Scaled Jiao would suddenly appear before his eyes!

Because these Demonic Beasts carried the power of ancient beast bloodlines, each was extremely formidable and could often unleash strength beyond its nominal tier; if they manifested talents passed down from antiquity, fighting one tier above was no problem at all.

In other words, the true strength of the beasts before them should be assessed at one tier higher than listed.

And at the moment...

"Peak Tenth-Tier peak? They're all peak Tenth-Tier?"

"What kind of Demonic Beasts are these?"

"Where did they come from?"

"What exactly is this young girl's background?"

The Jiang Family cultivators cried out, their feet nearly cramping from shock.

They had thought Mo Xiaoqi alone with Void King Realm cultivation would be an easy target — a means to pressure Yang Kai — but they never expected to have stirred up a hornet's nest!

Jiang Lin's face went deathly pale; as the Family Head he could read the signs well enough to know that this time his clan had offended someone they should never have provoked.

He had assumed Mo Xiaoqi merely had some background, but seeing her summon four peak Tenth-Tier Demonic Beasts with a wave of her hand, he immediately realized she had immense backing — far beyond what a small clan like theirs could afford to provoke.

As a Family Head, his worry deepened.

He stared at the small cloth bags at Mo Xiaoqi's waist and vaguely recalled something, though he could not think it through.

While the Jiang Family were still stunned, Mo Xiaoqi ground her silver teeth and said angrily, "Xiao Yin, Xiao Hong, Xiao Hei — teach these shameless bastards a lesson; how dare they gang up on me!"

"Xiao Yin, Xiao Hong, Xiao Hei..."

The Jiang Family were immediately thrown into alarm; cold sweat trickled from their brows.

Three rare, peak Tenth-Tier Demonic Beasts bearing ancient bloodlines were given such simple and ridiculous names...

Under other circumstances the Jiang Family might have burst into laughter, but in this moment they all felt like crying.

Roar...

Whoosh...

Hiss...

The three beasts seemed to understand Mo Xiaoqi's command and answered with strange cries.

The Silver-Maned Lion-Tiger Beast let out a roar and, exhibiting unexpected agility for its massive length, leapt into the Jiang Family ranks and swept its powerful forepaws across.

With that sweep a violent wind rose, nearly changing the color of the sky.

The Jiang Family members dared not meet the strike; they cried out and dodged.

The Red-Fire Qilin opened its mouth wide and unleashed volley after volley of searing, crimson fireballs, each at least the size of a millstone and suffused with terrifying flame power.

The fireballs struck the ground and melted the earth away.

The sight chilled the Jiang Family to their bones; they kept to a wide berth, fearing even the slightest contact.

The Blue-Eyed Ink-Scaled Jiao then moved, its scales exuding a layer of black aura that coalesced into a cloud-like mass which swept into the fray and enveloped three Void King Realm Jiang Family cultivators.

Shortly thereafter, the sounds of clashing and hissing came from within the black cloud.

Mo Xiaoqi stood composed inside the Weak Water Pearl's water curtain, cradling the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat in her arms as she leisurely groomed its fur and murmured, "Seems they can't gain the upper hand — shall I call out Xiao Bai, Xiao Huang, Xiao Qing, and Xiao Lu as well?"

The Jiang Family stood in stunned silence, utterly speechless.
