## Chapter 2276 — Spirit Lake

Half an hour later, Yang Kai was once again full of vigor, his complexion rosy, his eyes bright, no longer weak or disheveled as before.

He finished circulating his technique, his figure flickered, and he reappeared before the Incarnation.

The massive Incarnation seemed to sense something and opened his eyes to look at Yang Kai.

As their eyes met, Yang Kai said, “That Artifact Spirit doesn’t seem to have been completely destroyed. There’s still a trace of its soul hiding in the warhammer. Be careful.”

The Incarnation grinned, spreading his five fingers with a buzzing sound. “You mean this?”

Yang Kai looked closely and saw a mass of black qi condensed in the Incarnation’s palm. It seemed to possess intelligence, darting left and right, trying to escape control. But this was the Small Xuan Realm, and the Incarnation’s Divine Sense was connected with Yang Kai’s. With a single thought, the laws of the Small Xuan Realm were at his command. How could this black qi possibly escape? Though it was held in the palm, it was suppressed and locked down by the world itself, like a fierce beast trapped in a cage.

“You forced it out?” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed with surprise.

The Incarnation shook his head. “It came out on its own.”

“What happened?” Yang Kai’s eyes widened.

The Incarnation chuckled. “Probably sensed danger.”

Yang Kai was stunned. “What did you do?”

“Nothing much…” The Incarnation patted his belly and said carelessly, “I just ate the warhammer.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s mouth twitched and he wailed, “Will that cause problems? That’s an ancient demonic treasure, Imperial Treasure–level. Swallowing it so rashly—won't that cause problems for you?”

The Incarnation laughed proudly, “The Heaven Devouring Battle Art can devour anything—what’s a mere demonic war weapon? You haven’t cultivated this art, so you don’t understand its mysteries, but rest assured. Since I dared to do this, I naturally have confidence. Forget just a demonic artifact spirit—even the demonic intent sealed within your body, if I grow stronger, I could swallow it all!”

Yang Kai’s body trembled, and he exclaimed, “That’s possible? Wouldn’t this art be invincible under heaven?”

The Incarnation laughed. “Probably only this body of mine can do it. If you cultivated it, it wouldn’t work. Your flesh is strong, but it couldn’t withstand the pure Demonic Qi’s corruption. If you practiced the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, you’d soon lose your mind and become a killing machine.”

Yang Kai nodded. “I understand. Wu Mengchuan really had no good intentions. I just don’t know why he passed this art to me in the first place. What was his goal?”

The Incarnation said, “He probably never expected you’d resist the temptation to cultivate it and hand it to me.”

Yang Kai was silent for a moment, then replied, “If it weren’t for you, maybe I really would have tried cultivating it. After all… the Heaven Devouring Battle Art’s reputation is too great. Anyone would find it hard to resist.”

At this, Yang Kai waved his hand. “Forget it, you go ahead and refine and devour it. If you can truly refine that demonic war weapon, it’ll be a great benefit to you.”

With that, Yang Kai’s figure flickered and he left the Small Xuan Realm, reappearing in Yuqing Mountain.

Looking around, he saw Hua Qingsi sitting cross-legged on the ground, leaning against a big tree, enthusiastically studying the Xuan Realm Pearl in her hand.

Yang Kai glanced at her. Seeing she hadn’t noticed him, he reached out and retrieved the Xuan Realm Pearl, then looked around. He asked in surprise, “Where’s Liu Yan?”

He didn’t see any sign of Liu Yan, and even the Luan Feng Black Flame that had covered a hundred li was gone.

“She went back.” Hua Qingsi stood up and answered.

Yang Kai was taken aback. With a thought, he sensed Liu Yan’s presence inside the Xuan Realm Pearl; at that moment she was wrapped in black fire, struggling to refine it.

He didn’t know when she had returned to the Small Xuan Realm, but it must have been the Incarnation who brought her back.

What surprised Yang Kai was that Liu Yan had managed to absorb so much of the Luan Feng Black Flame in such a short time; judging by her state, it would still take time to fully refine it.

"You go back too, I have other things to do!" Yang Kai said, then put Hua Qingsi back into the Xuan Realm Pearl. He took out a Transmission Compass and sent a message to Qin Chaoyang to look after Zhang Ruoxi, then headed back.

According to Hua Qingsi, Zhang Ruoxi was now with the woman named Ye Qinghan. Although Yang Kai didn’t think Ye Qinghan was a bad person, it was still better to entrust her to someone familiar.

After receiving Qin Chaoyang’s reply, Yang Kai put away the Transmission Compass. Spatial Law surged, and he crossed a hundred li in an instant.

Soon, he returned to the place where the eighteen spirit springs had been.

Looking around, the terrain here had changed dramatically due to the earlier battle. Most notably, at the site of the battlefield, a spirit lake about ten thousand zhang in area had appeared.

Earlier, the Artifact Spirit had smashed down with the warhammer, collapsing the underground space and creating a huge pit. Then, spirit liquid from beneath the eighteen spirit springs surged up, filling the pit and gradually forming a lake.

This was a true spirit lake. The sparkling water in the lake was all liquefied Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth.

In just a few hours, the lake had already overflowed, and the excess water spread outward, turning into pure, dense Spiritual Qi that filled the area.

Countless cultivators gathered around the spirit lake, all looking excited.

These people had clearly rushed over from Fenglin City.

By the time Yang Kai arrived, the lake was already crowded with cultivators.

Each cultivator occupied a spot, seizing the time to circulate their techniques and absorb the pure Spiritual Qi here. The closer to the center of the lake, the stronger the cultivators.

Those Dao Origin Realm cultivators were basically all in the center.

Around the edges of the lake were Origin Returning Realm and Void King Realm cultivators.

From time to time, people fought fiercely over a spot.

Seeing the scene, Yang Kai understood that this place would surely become a renowned Sacred Land for cultivation in the entire Southern Territory, even the Star Realm, and would eventually be controlled by the top forces.

When that happened, ordinary cultivators would no longer be able to enter freely; they’d likely have to pay a price.

Yang Kai wasn’t the only one who saw this. All the Dao Origin Realm cultivators probably realized it too, knowing this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so they were all making the most of it, cultivating here as long as possible.

No surprise, the news of the spirit lake in Fenglin City had probably already spread to all the major sects. Within three days at most, Emperor Realm experts would arrive to take over the lake.

Yang Kai saw the Dao Origin Realm cultivators from before, as well as Qin Chaoyang and the others. Zhang Ruoxi and Ye Qinghan were with Qin Chaoyang’s group, occupying a good spot in the center of the lake.

Yang Kai didn’t greet them, but quietly found a spot and dove in.

There were many cultivators under the lake as well, focused on cultivation.

Yang Kai used the Nothingness secret art, concealing his aura and the fluctuations of his Qi and blood. In the dense Spiritual Qi, unless someone looked closely, it was impossible to detect his presence.

He went straight down to where the eighteen spirit springs had been.

No one was here now, probably because the Demonic Warhammer had manifested here before, so everyone was wary of the bottom, afraid of danger.

Yang Kai was happy about this. Spreading out his Divine Sense, he found the center of the eighteen spirit springs, took out the Xuan Realm Pearl, opened a rift, and let the spirit liquid flow into the Small Xuan Realm. He sat cross-legged, consolidating his Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation.

Because the laws of the Small Xuan Realm were incomplete, it couldn’t generate its own Spiritual Qi. To maintain such a good cultivation environment, it had to be replenished from the outside.

Right now was the best time to do so.

Before the Emperor Realm experts arrived, Yang Kai didn’t have much time. Once they came, he wouldn’t be able to collect Spiritual Qi so freely.

Gradually, Yang Kai settled into meditation, his mind clear and undisturbed.

Meanwhile, the cultivators around the spirit lake witnessed a strange scene.

“Why isn’t the lake water spreading anymore?”

“Huh? It’s true. Not only is it not spreading, it’s even slowly receding.”

“Could it be that this spirit lake is just a fleeting phenomenon and will disappear in a few days?”

“Shut your crow’s mouth! It wasn’t easy for Fenglin City to get such a Sacred Land for cultivation. How could it disappear so easily? The water receding is normal. It’ll stabilize soon.”

Many cultivators noticed the anomaly but didn’t know the reason. Even the Dao Origin Realm experts couldn’t figure it out.

But with such a rare cultivation opportunity, now wasn’t the time to investigate, so after a brief commotion, the lake calmed down again.

Thousands gathered here, with more on the outskirts, and cultivators kept arriving from Fenglin City, joining the cultivation army. The scene was spectacular.

Normally, with so many cultivators cultivating together, the Spiritual Qi would never be enough, but now it was so dense it had formed a lake. Even if tens of thousands came, it couldn’t be exhausted.

Time passed slowly. From time to time, cultivators would break through; whenever that happened, those nearby would glare at them and curse under their breath.

If any cultivator sensed the signs of breaking through to a higher Realm, they would consciously leave the area, heading to the outermost edge to find a suitable place and welcome the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy.

The entire spirit lake, and even the area around Fenglin City, was swept up in a wave of breakthroughs, a joyful atmosphere enveloping the land for a hundred thousand li.

Time passed slowly. After three days, as Yang Kai was meditating under the lake, he suddenly sensed something, opened his eyes, and sighed softly, muttering, “Why did they come so quickly!”

As he spoke, he formed hand seals, put away the Xuan Realm Pearl, and with a flicker appeared above the spirit lake.
