## Chapter 2334 — Ungrateful

Liu Yan had followed him for many years; throughout that time they had watched over and helped each other. She had assisted Yang Kai countless times. If she were to perish here because of this strange stone, Yang Kai could never accept it.

If that happened, he would dig up Ye Chong’s corpse, grind his bones to dust, and vent his hatred.

Thinking it over, it didn’t seem likely. Ye Chong needed something from him and would never leave a strange stone here to harm him.

However... when he mentioned there was an opportunity in this cave earlier, why did he keep staring at Liu Yan?

Yang Kai’s mind was in turmoil. Just then, a faintly familiar aura suddenly surged from within the strange stone.

Sensing that trace of aura, Yang Kai’s expression brightened, and he hurriedly called out, “Liu Yan!”

That aura was definitely Liu Yan’s, just extremely weak. If not for their years together, he wouldn’t have noticed it.

With an aura lingering, it meant Liu Yan hadn’t perished—she was merely sealed within the strange stone. Realizing this, Yang Kai dared not attack the stone recklessly, fearing he might harm Liu Yan.

Yet despite his calls, Liu Yan gave no response. Moreover, in Yang Kai’s perception, the wisp of aura leaking from Liu Yan was extremely calm. Though the fluctuation was faint to the extreme, there were no signs of injury.

It seemed as if she had fallen into a deep sleep.

What was going on? Yang Kai couldn’t figure it out no matter how hard he tried.

He cautiously released his Divine Sense to probe again, but just like before, the moment his Divine Sense entered the stone, it was as if bitten off by an invisible maw. Not only did his probe fail, but his Sea of Consciousness also throbbed with pain.

Who knew what this strange stone was? It could even devour Divine Sense, proving its extraordinary quality.

Wisps of crimson, nearly invisible to the naked eye, began to seep from within the stone, spreading to its surface. Yang Kai’s eyes lit up at the sight. He was all too familiar with this crimson aura—it was the extremely complex flame power unique to Liu Yan, fused from countless rare fires, yet perfectly blended together. In this world, only Liu Yan possessed it. There was no second like it.

Could it be that Liu Yan was inside, trying to break through the sealing force?

At this thought, Yang Kai’s tense heart relaxed somewhat. He forced himself to calm down and observed carefully, wanting to see if there was any way he could help Liu Yan.

After the crimson color spread out, the stone suddenly let out a hum, and then it began to emit a powerful suction, madly absorbing the surrounding Spiritual Qi.

In an instant, wild winds howled through the cave, wailing and whistling. The dense Spiritual Qi of this secret realm surged into the stone, vanishing without a trace as if thrown into the sea.

On the contrary, as the Spiritual Qi disappeared, the crimson color on the stone’s surface grew even more intense, and Liu Yan’s aura became increasingly clear.

Spiritual Qi? Yang Kai’s heart stirred. Without hesitation, he waved his hand, dumping tens of millions of Source Crystals all around the stone, so many that they nearly filled the cave. These Source Crystals were all Middle-Level and Upper-Level—there wasn’t a single Lower-Level one among them. They had all been stripped from that Source Crystal vein.

Yang Kai then smashed the Source Crystals to powder, turning them into a sea of energy that enveloped the stone.

Visibly, the stone continued to absorb the surrounding energy without end, as if it would never be satisfied.

……

Just as Liu Yan found herself in peril, a tense and foreboding atmosphere descended outside Thousand Leaves Sect—every gust of wind seemed to carry danger, and even the grass and trees bristled as if ready for battle.

Over a thousand cultivators had gathered before Thousand Leaves Sect’s Protective Mountain Array, glaring at the sect like tigers eyeing their prey.

These thousand people belonged to different factions, yet all seemed to take their lead from a blue-haired middle-aged man. No one knew what secret art he cultivated, but his long, water-blue hair hung loosely over his shoulders. He was tall and imposing, his expression naturally dignified and commanding.

He sat atop a roofless palanquin carried by sixteen men. The palanquin was spacious and radiated a strong Spiritual Qi fluctuation, clearly a remarkable Secret Treasure. At this moment, the blue-haired man was leisurely sipping tea, as if he were out on a casual excursion.

Many experts were gathered around him.

Among the crowd stood Luo Jin, the City Lord of Tianhe City, whom Yang Kai had once given a harsh lesson. It was hard to tell what miraculous spiritual pill or medicine Luo Jin had taken, for all traces of his previous injuries had vanished without a mark. His spirit was vigorous, and his complexion was ruddy, as if he had never suffered a setback at all.

Gathered around him were quite a few powerful experts.

The two old men who had previously protected Qiu Yu, the Young Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace, also stood nearby, heads bowed, showing the utmost respect to the blue-haired man.

There was another striking man present. In terms of cultivation, he was no weaker than anyone here. He was broad-shouldered and burly, with a wild, rugged appearance. The aura he exuded was extremely violent, and he looked to be in his forties or fifties.

This man stood to the side, occasionally glancing at the blue-haired middle-aged man with a sneer, clearly looking down on his mannerisms.

All of them were leaders of nearby sects, with similar status and strength. Yet the blue-haired man acted as if he were above them all, a crane among chickens, which naturally made the others displeased.

If someone unaware saw this scene, they would surely think all the cultivators here were following the blue-haired man’s lead.

Over a thousand cultivators from five or six sects had gathered here, yet after assembling, not a single word was spoken. It was as if they were all silently waiting for something.

Luo Jin’s face was twisted with resentment and hatred as he stared ahead, fists clenched tightly.

Just days ago, he had been holding a grand concubine-accepting ceremony at the City Lord’s mansion, only for it to be ruined midway. Not only was his bride snatched away in front of everyone, but he himself was beaten so badly that, if not for a stroke of luck, he would have died.

Though only a few days had passed, the incident had already spread like wildfire throughout the surrounding region. Every cultivator in Tianhe City knew about it.

His prestige in Tianhe City had plummeted. Everywhere he went, he felt people pointing and whispering behind his back. Worse still, voices of discontent had arisen in the city, calling for him to step down.

How could Luo Jin tolerate such a thing? He had managed Tianhe City for so many years, and just as he was about to rise to stand equal with the surrounding sects, how could he accept failure at the final moment?

And the culprit behind it all was that brat named Yang Kai! As long as he could kill Yang Kai and wash away his shame, Luo Jin believed he could stabilize Tianhe City once more. Then, no one would dare utter a word against him!

Hating Yang Kai, Luo Jin naturally had no good feelings toward Thousand Leaves Sect for sheltering him. He secretly resolved that if Ye Hen knew what was good for him, things would be fine. If not, he would make Ye Hen suffer the consequences.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

At that moment, a streak of light shot over from the front. As the light faded, the high-ranking members of Thousand Leaves Sect appeared, with Ye Hen at the forefront. The Vice Sect Master, Elders, and others followed behind him.

Even though they had received word in advance, seeing so many experts gathered before their Protective Mountain Array still made Ye Hen and the others’ faces change dramatically.

Gathered here were the forces of five or six surrounding factions. There were at least two hundred Dao Origin Realm cultivators, more than a dozen at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and the rest were all Void King Realm cultivators. With such strength, how could Thousand Leaves Sect possibly withstand them alone?

Ye Hen steadied himself, cupped his fists, and said, “Friends, your presence brings honor to our humble sect. May I ask why you have come unannounced?”

He knew the visitors had come with ill intent and that things would not end peacefully. But with the Protective Mountain Array in place, he was not too afraid. If it were an ordinary sect’s array, it would be nothing, unable to withstand so many experts’ attacks.

But Thousand Leaves Sect’s Protective Mountain Array had been passed down for generations and was of the highest grade, far superior to those of lesser sects. If Thousand Leaves Sect were stronger, the array’s defenses could be raised several more levels. Once activated, even a dozen Emperor Realm masters working together might not be able to break it.

Even so, the array as it was now should be more than enough to hold off these people. This was the fundamental reason why Thousand Leaves Sect, though in decline, had never fallen.

If the Protective Mountain Array could not be broken, no one would dare truly fall out with Thousand Leaves Sect.

As soon as Ye Hen finished speaking, Luo Jin was the first to jump out, shouting harshly, “Ye, don’t play dumb! Don’t you know why we’re here? If you know what’s good for you, hand over that brat Yang Kai and the others, or don’t blame us for being rude!”

Ye Hen frowned and said, “City Lord Luo, what grudge do you have with Young Master Yang to be so furious?”

Seeing him feign ignorance, Luo Jin was nearly beside himself with rage. His face darkened as he said, “Ye Hen, are you mocking me? Don’t you know what happened at my City Lord’s mansion a few days ago? Or are you deliberately trying to humiliate me!”

Ye Hen replied calmly, “I’ve heard a little, but not the details.”

Luo Jin roared, “That brat caused chaos at my City Lord’s mansion, stole my concubine, and injured my guests! How could I possibly let him off?”

Ye Hen said, “That’s not quite how I heard it. I heard City Lord Luo bullied the weak, oppressed men and women, imprisoned several of Young Master Yang’s friends, and forced his mother-in-law to marry him. Young Master Yang had no choice but to fight. Though he won in the end, he was merciful enough to spare your life… City Lord Luo, not only are you ungrateful, but after just a few days, you’re already repaying kindness with enmity?”

Luo Jin’s face turned blue and then red, and he bellowed, “Nonsense!”

Ye Hen said coldly, “There were countless guests that day, all eyes were watching. Whether I’m making things up or City Lord Luo is being ungrateful, I believe everyone here knows the truth.”

A surge of hot blood rushed through Luo Jin’s heart, nearly bursting out. This was the greatest humiliation of his life. Now that Ye Hen had brought it up in public, he was burning with rage. If not for the Protective Mountain Array in the way, he would have rushed at Ye Hen already.

Ye Hen cupped his fists and looked around, saying, “Friends, you all know what happened. Why not tell City Lord Luo the details, so he doesn’t misunderstand and do something that would anger both men and gods?”

The cultivators who had come here showed no intention of speaking up. They hadn’t come to argue with Ye Hen. Even if Ye Hen was telling the truth, so what? Yang Kai had indeed killed people—elite members of their sects. Now that they knew Yang Kai was in Thousand Leaves Sect, how could they just stand by and do nothing?
