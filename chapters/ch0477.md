## Chapter 477 — Asking for Advice

The atmosphere was harmonious, and the crowd exchanged greetings continuously.

Qiu Yimeng observed quietly nearby and noticed seven or eight martial artists whose hands were wrapped in white cloth, giving off a somewhat eerie feeling. Instantly, she realized these must be disciples of Ghost King Valley.

But the backgrounds of the others brought great excitement to Qiu Yimeng.

Among them were actually artifact refining masters from Baoqi Sect! Especially the renowned name Wu Yan. Naturally, Qiu Yimeng was familiar with him. Within Baoqi Sect, apart from the Sect Leader, Wu Yan’s artifact refining skills were the most outstanding.

Legend had it that Wu Yan traveled far and wide—across rivers and mountains, even beyond foreign lands—for twenty years to collect special flames for artifact refining. He absorbed those mysterious earthly spiritual fires, forcibly transforming his constitution and True Yuan attributes.

He was a top-tier refining master capable of forging mid-level Mystery-Grade treasures.

In the refining world, his fame rivaled that of Xiao Fusheng in the alchemy circle.

However, artifact refining was more intricate and time-consuming than alchemy, needing more resources. Moreover, martial artists demanded pills far more than treasures, so Wu Yan’s reputation lagged behind Xiao Fusheng’s, and Baoqi Sect was lesser-known compared to Yao Wang Valley.

Still, none of this diminished Wu Yan’s extraordinary skills and miraculous methods in artifact refining.

Besides him, almost twenty other disciples from Baoqi Sect had come, each an outstanding refining master.

Qiu Yimeng dared not be negligent.

She and Yang Kai jointly arranged for the Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect members to rest inside the mansion. Her face flushed red with excitement, walking almost on air.

Counting on her fingers, Qiu Yimeng suddenly realized that the number of allies Yang Kai had gathered was astonishing. Ignoring the help from more than a dozen various forces, the mere addition of Yao Wang Valley and Baoqi Sect alone would make anyone envious.

How did he pull this off?

Gazing at the man ahead, Qiu Yimeng felt her heart flutter and bit her delicate lips, mesmerized.

Lost in chaotic thoughts, she blindly followed Yang Kai into the main hall, still dazed. Her mind pictured a bright future unfolding in Yang Kai’s hands.

That scene where Yang Kai subdued all his elder brothers, won the succession war, and became head of the Yang Family was too enchanting.

Her breath quickened. She felt gratitude once more for her decision to leave her clan and help him.

“Your old servant pays respects to the Young Master!” At that moment, a sudden voice echoed, making Qiu Yimeng startle. She looked over and froze.

She saw a middle-aged man, highly respected by both Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect’s Wu Yan, kneeling on one knee humbly, his demeanor respectful and his head bowed.

"Old servant"? "Young Master"?

Qiu Yimeng involuntarily parted her lips, covering her mouth with a hand, her beautiful eyes trembling.

Though she currently did not know the strength of this Senior Di, his aura felt even more oppressive than the mansion’s blood servants.

That meant this eerie middle-aged man was certainly stronger than the blood servants.

Yet here he was lowering himself so humbly, even calling himself ‘old servant’. Not even the blood servants who followed Yang Kai would behave so obsequiously.

She glanced confusedly at Yang Kai, only to find him calm and unbothered. He said lightly, “Rise, there’s no need for such formality between us.”

“Thank you, Young Master.” The middle-aged man’s face brightened as he stood, seeming relieved.

Noticing Qiu Yimeng’s surprise, Di Mo turned to smile at her. “Young lady, we are no strangers. I won’t hide my relationship with the Young Master from you, but you mustn’t tell anyone. Our Young Master keeps a low profile.”

Qiu Yimeng quickly recovered and responded seriously, “Please rest assured, elder. I… cough, I saw nothing. You may continue.”

Actually, now was best to leave quickly.

The fewer secrets she knew, the safer she was. But a woman’s powerful curiosity rooted her to the spot.

She wondered how such a mysterious and formidable expert could be like a servant to Yang Kai.

What merit did the brat have?

“How is your body?” Yang Kai did not send Qiu Yimeng away. After all, the future was long, and Qiu Yimeng was the second most important person in the mansion. He could not hide his relationship with Di Mo from her—better to be upfront.

Hearing this, Di Mo’s face turned grateful as he replied solemnly, “After these few months of activity, it’s stable. No issues will arise for at least thirty years.”

“What about after thirty years?” Yang Kai frowned, finding the idea of a soul inhabiting another’s body bewildering and its mysteries utterly opaque.

“That depends on my efforts. If I can perfectly integrate with this body, I won’t need to change it again later. But if not, I’ll have to find another suitable one after thirty years.”

“If there’s any way I can assist, just say it.” Yang Kai nodded slightly, no need for formality between them.

“Thank you, Young Master. For now, things are fine.”

“Good. If you have nothing else, go see someone in the back.”

“Who?”

“Meng Wuya!” Yang Kai smiled at Di Mo. Seeing his expression shift to apprehension, Yang Kai knew that Meng Wuya’s capabilities had made Di Mo uneasy, confirming that Shopkeeper Meng was more formidable than he had imagined.

“That old bastard!” Di Mo gritted his teeth in hatred. “I’ll go have a proper talk with him—settle new and old grudges!”

Chuckling, he said, “Young Master, you enjoy yourself with this young lady. I’ll go find him.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he waved his hand.

Di Mo vanished in a flash.

Only two remained in the main hall.

“May I ask who this elder really is?” Qiu Yimeng’s curious voice broke the silence.

Yang Kai shook his head.

“Fine, whatever you’re up to remains mysterious. I’m used to it.” Qiu Yimeng snorted.

“How is the refining progress of the treasures?” Yang Kai looked at her. Recently, both she and the others had been refining treasures.

“Almost done. In about two days, more than half should have completed.” Qiu Yimeng smiled brightly. “How about you?”

“I’ve just refined one.”

“That fast?” Qiu Yimeng’s expression changed. All the treasures Yang Kai got were Mystery-Grade; with his cultivation, five days wouldn’t normally be enough to refine one. Her shock was brief before controlling her expression. This man’s miracles and mysteries were becoming less surprising—she was developing immunity.

“The Baoqi Sect people have arrived. You’ll be busy, too. I’ve already marked the refining area. Arrange things for them. We have accumulated many materials. Also, inform the pill workshop to prepare pills that quickly restore True Yuan. Refining consumes True Yuan; don’t let the refining masters overwork themselves.”

“I understand.”

“Then that’s settled.” Yang Kai nodded and stood up, heading inward.

Watching his receding figure, Qiu Yimeng opened her mouth, then swallowed her words. For some reason, she particularly wanted to talk to him more during these days.

After Yang Kai left, Qiu Yimeng smiled bitterly and shook her head. She realized that the man’s mysteries had become her fatal weakness. Driven by curiosity, she longed to unearth all the secrets from his heart.

The next day, Yang Kai visited the Baoqi Sect members’ residence. After bargaining with Wu Yan for a while, both sides reached an agreement.

Unlike Yao Wang Valley—whose people came to learn alchemy from Xia Ningshang—Baoqi Sect sought refuge.

Tao Yang had persuaded Wu Yan to join the succession war on Yang Kai’s behalf. The condition was that once Yang Kai became head of the Yang Family, he must publicly declare Baoqi Sect under his protection.

If Yang Kai failed in the succession, he would still have to protect Baoqi Sect from harassment by other factions.

Yang Kai agreed to all terms.

Tao Yang felt embarrassed but helpless. He was a young disciple with no say in the sect’s future stability.

After the deal, Baoqi Sect immediately began their refining work.

Wu Yan also said the Mystery-Grade treasures under a certain grade Yang Kai’s group snatched from Po Jing Lake could be further refined by him, possibly upgraded a rank. Even if not upgraded, their usability would improve.

He had the skill for it!

Yang Kai was excited. Refining a treasure was different from forging it; the former was a repeated process to remove dross and enhance the core, saving time, effort, and materials. He immediately told Qiu Yimeng to let those interested know that they could approach Baoqi Sect experts.

After handling Baoqi Sect matters, Yang Kai hurried to Meng Wuya’s room.

Di Mo had gone to see Meng Wuya yesterday and nothing had come of it so far. Yang Kai worried. If the two old bastards fought, this mansion might be destroyed in an instant.

Soon, Yang Kai realized his worries were unnecessary.

Inside Shopkeeper Meng’s room, only Di Mo and Meng Wuya sat facing each other, grinning slyly. It seemed they had exchanged blows but now the atmosphere was peaceful yet strange.

“Gentlemen, enjoying your chat?” Yang Kai entered with a smile.

“Not bad.” Meng Wuya nodded slightly. Di Mo looked serious, probably having taken a loss.

“I won’t disturb your talk, but I have something to ask.” Yang Kai’s expression turned serious.

“Young Master, what is it?” Di Mo hastened to ask.

“That mysterious expert!” Yang Kai glanced at Meng Wuya. Shopkeeper Meng’s brow furrowed instantly, understanding what he meant.

Last time they both sensed that mysterious figure’s aura, but by the time Yang Kai arrived, she had vanished.

At Po Jing Lake, that person appeared again, stealing a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure!

Yang Kai felt a fishbone stuck in his throat. That person must be eliminated…
