## Chapter 915 — You Speak So Sweetly

Seeing his solemn expression, Yang Kai hurriedly asked, "Shopkeeper Meng, is there some hidden meaning in what he said? What exactly is this 'sealed world' he mentioned?"

"I don't know," Meng Wuya slowly shook his head. "But don't tell anyone else about this matter for now; let me think it over carefully."

"Oh." Yang Kai nodded, recalling the words of the Great Demon God's soul incarnation, and another thought occurred to him—he had been told to go to the Demon Capital, and that once there the secrets would naturally be revealed.

But places like the Demon Capital aren't somewhere one can go casually.

They sped along, the Flying Shuttle streaking like lightning.

Meng Wuya reined in his mind and couldn't help but marvel at the incredible speed of this Secret Treasure.

Yang Kai held the little senior sister in his arms at the rear of the Flying Shuttle, breathing in her scent, feeling the softness and warmth of her body, and his whole being relaxed at once.

He hugged her tighter.

The little senior sister's delicate body trembled slightly; her long lashes fluttered, her breath grew hot, and her flushed face seemed on the verge of bleeding with color.

Held like that by Yang Kai, their skins pressing together, each could feel the other's rising temperature and strong heartbeat; for the innocent, unspoiled little senior sister, it was undeniably overwhelming.

Yang Kai didn't wake her. He simply enjoyed the quiet, his gaze burning as he stared at her face, whispering softly, "Little senior sister, you are truly beautiful."

Seated upfront, Meng Wuya shivered involuntarily and snapped angrily, "How shameless!"

Those brazen words in his ears made him feel utterly unable to bear it.

Even Li Rong's eyes brimmed with tears; she pressed her red lips together, moved a little forward to distance herself from Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang, and, making conversation, said to Meng Wuya, "Sir, if there's nothing else, tell me about our lord's past—our branch still knows too little about him."

"You want to know his past?" Meng Wuya raised an eyebrow and let out a sly chuckle. "Oh, I know a whole basketful of stories. Come, I'll tell you in detail—let you see how shameless and lecherous your lord really is! That fellow is nothing but a lecher; wherever he goes he picks up trouble with women."

Li Rong smiled lightly without interrupting, focusing on listening.

Meng Wuya immediately began to speak at length, as if afraid Yang Kai would hear his slander. He waved his hand and formed a barrier that enveloped him and Li Rong.

Yang Kai pretended not to notice and grew even more brazen.

He grasped the little senior sister's soft, boneless hand and caressed it, bringing it to his cheek and blowing gently into her ear: "Ten years. Every day I wanted to see you. Now at last my wish is fulfilled, and under such circumstances. Little senior sister, isn't this fate? It must be heaven arranging for me to go to that place to save the most important woman in my life."

The little senior sister's lashes trembled more violently, apparently moved by Yang Kai's words; her long neck lifted slightly, fair skin gleaming with an alluring sheen.

"Thinking back now, junior brother feels quite fortunate. If I hadn't gone with Li Rong back then, I might truly never have seen you." Yang Kai said, a trace of lingering fear flickering across his face.

The two Great Yao Lords mainly invited Li Rong to go to that place; Yang Kai had volunteered to follow and unexpectedly encountered Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang there.

It was a little too coincidental.

"Ah, over these ten years I met all kinds of women, many beautiful girls, but none moved me like you and Su Yan did—leaving me longing and unable to forget. Your figures have imprinted indelibly on my heart. If you are well, junior brother is content..."

Simple words of affection flowed from Yang Kai's mouth, gentle as water; that tenderness, sweet as fresh spring, poured into Xia Ningshang's heart, prompting her to hug him tighter—her small hands gripping so hard it seemed she wanted to melt into him.

Yang Kai lifted his head and looked at his little senior sister, seeing that her beautiful eyes were moist, her cheeks flushed, and a rosy haze colored her neck as she breathed like a fragrant orchid.

Their eyes met; the little senior sister shyly averted her gaze and murmured in a half-dream, "You speak so sweetly... say more..."

After making the request, she hurriedly shut her eyes and buried her face in Yang Kai's chest, not daring to meet his gaze.

"No problem." Yang Kai, of course, would not disappoint her; he wracked his brains to pour out his longing—those brazen words like a spell that struck Xia Ningshang's heart, making it tremble and her delicate body shiver.

Feeling Yang Kai's warmth and listening to his voice, Xia Ningshang was utterly satisfied, feeling as if she could die at that moment and it would matter not.

"You little brat..." Meng Wuya ground his teeth ahead, his eyes flashing with ferocity.

Li Rong smiled lightly and said, "Sir, don't be too bothered. With our lord's talent, he can certainly give that girl happiness."

"Ah..." Shopkeeper Meng sighed softly. "Girls grow up—there's no holding them back. Fine, I'm heading to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land this trip to retire in peace."

"Don't say that, sir. You are still vigorous; our lord will need your assistance in the future."

Meng Wuya sneered and glanced at Li Rong. "You seem very loyal to that brat. With you by his side, I can rest easy. But be careful not to be deceived by his appearance—don't let yourself be bewitched and lose your senses like my precious disciple did. He looks human, but he's worse than a beast."

Li Rong's face reddened. "You're joking, sir. Our Ancient Demon Clan is the sharp blade in our lord's hand; when he commands, we dare not disobey."

"Stop calling me 'sir.' We are the same rank—both Third Stage of the Saint Realm—treat me as a peer." Meng Wuya chuckled.

"That won't do. You are my lord's elder and therefore my elder," Li Rong hastily waved her hand.

Seeing her attitude, Meng Wuya lost interest and closed his eyes to rest.

From behind came the whispers of Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang; the two seemed to be exchanging pleasant words.

In just two short days, Nine Peaks was in sight.

The Flying Shuttle's speed was terrifying to the extreme.

A streak of azure light cut across the sky and shot straight into Nine Peaks.

The group appeared, and sensing the powerful expert aura coming from them, the Saint Realm cultivators within the Sacred Land hurried out from their positions.

Meng Wuya frowned, extended his divine sense, and asked suspiciously, "Little Yang Kai, why are there so many people outside the Nine Heavens Sacred Land? What are they doing here?"

"They're here to request pills," Yang Kai grinned.

"Request pills?" Meng Wuya raised an eyebrow, disdainful. "You have pill-masters in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?"

"Our lord is a Saint-Grade alchemist!" Li Rong hurriedly explained. "Those who came are attracted by his reputation, but outsiders do not know the true identity of the alchemist here."

"Oh? You can refine pills?" Meng Wuya looked at Yang Kai in surprise.

"So-so. Of course, not as good as the little senior sister." Yang Kai glanced at Xia Ningshang standing beside him.

"At least you have some self-awareness!" Meng Wuya nodded.

Li Rong arched her brows and stared at Xia Ningshang in astonishment, a hint of doubt on her face.

She knew Yang Kai's alchemy level better than anyone; from his words it sounded like his little senior sister's alchemy might surpass his.

Could that be possible?

While they spoke, Saint Realm experts came rushing from all directions—the elders of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and several leaders of the Ancient Demon Clan arrived.

When they saw Yang Kai's return, everyone rejoiced. Xu Hui and the others immediately stepped forward to salute, their faces full of relief as they exclaimed, "Saint Lord, you're finally back! If you hadn't returned, I almost felt like taking my own life."

"What's happened? Has something occurred in the Sacred Land?" Yang Kai was greatly surprised.

"Nothing major. It's just that those masters have been asking about your whereabouts every day, urging you to return. You were away for three months, and during that time the masters grew exhausted refining pills; they kept asking for people and I couldn't avoid them."

"Uh..." Yang Kai stood there dumbfounded.

He had almost forgotten about Du Wan and the others.

With Xu Hui's reminder, he recalled that the five masters had been left in charge of refining pills after he left, and after three months of pill production they must have been worn out.

Those masters were already old, yet they'd been working for free in the Sacred Land.

A wave of guilt washed through him.

"Issue an order: the Sacred Land will temporarily stop refining pills for others for ten days so the masters can rest properly!" Yang Kai instructed.

"But more and more people keep coming to request pills. If we stop, won't we anger the masses?" Xu Hui worried; it was precisely because of this worry that they hadn't dared pause while Yang Kai was away.

"Tell them our Sacred Land masters are ill and need rest. If they come for pills, they must have patience—if they don't, they can leave. We're only making them wait ten days; it's not a refusal to help, and they won't dare complain."

Besides, if they try elsewhere, the wait will be even longer.

"Understood." Xu Hui obeyed and immediately ordered his disciples to relay the message to the outside elders.

After arranging everything, Xu Hui turned to Meng Wuya, surprised: "Isn't this the friend of the former Saint Lord?"

When Meng Wuya had brought Xia Ningshang here before, he had only conversed with the former Saint Lord during his stay; Xu Hui and the others did not know Meng Wuya's background or name, though they had some impression of his appearance.

"Let me introduce him—this is my sect elder, Meng Wuya," Yang Kai said.

"A pleasure!" Xu Hui clasped his hands in greeting, feeling the newcomer's strength and growing very solemn; he sensed this person was far more formidable than the last time he appeared.

But the name still nagged at Xu Hui—he felt he'd heard it before, yet couldn't recall where. He slowly shook his head in puzzlement.
