## Chapter 906 — Disturbance at the Heavenly Journey Palace

“I think we might be lost.” Lei Long suddenly stopped, his expression grim.

In the hazy world, visibility barely reached beyond a short distance and even divine sense could not extend; the six of them stood in place, unable to move forward.

It had been a long time since Li Rong broke through to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; no one knew exactly how long, only that her cultivation had thoroughly stabilized during this period.

With no clear direction or goal, the group floated without purpose and now had no idea where they were.

Earth-Splitting Divine Ox eyed him suspiciously. “Everything looks the same around here — what makes you think we’re lost?”

“Look over there.” The Great Lord Lei Long pointed not far off, and everyone followed his gesture to find, to their surprise, a set of bleached bones left on the wasteland.

“We passed this place not long ago. For some reason we turned back, and these scattered bones are the best proof.”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and the sight jogged his memory.

He hadn’t paid much attention to the bones the last time he saw them; if Lei Long’s observation was correct, they must have walked a large circle and returned to the same spot.

“No way — what do we do then?” Earth-Splitting Divine Ox was stunned. “How can we get lost?”

“I don’t know either. Think, all of you — any good ideas to get us out of here? Even if we can’t unravel the mysteries, we at least need to find the way back. We’ve been here a while.”

“You’re leading us and you don’t even know the way—what else can we do?” Earth-Splitting Divine Ox shouted.

“Don’t pin this on me.” Lei Long snorted. “It’s not my fault — do you want to blame me for this?”

They had been here for a long time; aside from Li Rong’s fortunate rise to the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, the others had gained nothing, so the two Great Lords were naturally in poor spirits.

Seeing signs that they were about to start arguing, Yang Kai hurriedly intervened, “Everyone stay calm. Before we came in, none of us expected this place to be so strange. Now that something’s gone wrong, don’t point fingers — we need to find a way to solve it.”

“How do you propose we solve it? Kid, did you notice anything unusual?” Lei Long asked Yang Kai.

Yang Kai shook his head.

“I think someone set this place up as a maze…” Li Rong mused. “Those bones probably belong to warriors who wandered in by accident and were trapped to their deaths.”

“I thought the same.” Lei Long nodded.

Along the way they occasionally encountered a skeleton or two — likely traces of those careless fighters who had entered and perished.

“Who could set up such a maze?” Earth-Splitting Divine Ox widened his eyes. “Who could fashion a formation none of us three at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm can break?”

Even without mastery of array techniques, cultivators who had reached the Third Stage of the Saint Realm could normally see through illusions at a glance. Yet none of the experts here had detected anything uncanny, showing that whoever arranged this formation was highly skilled.

“I increasingly feel this may be related to that legend of the Great Demon God.” Lei Long said in a low voice. “No one but him could do something like this.”

Yang Kai and Li Rong exchanged a look and fell silent.

Caidie hesitated, then suggested, “Should we split up to search for an exit?”

Lei Long and Yang Kai both shook their heads. Lei Long said, “This place is too strange. Don’t split up — you might never find each other again.”

“What rotten luck. Old Ox here will never casually enter some Small Xuan Realm again.” Earth-Splitting Divine Ox complained angrily.

Yang Kai smiled wryly and was deep in thought when he suddenly felt a ripple of thought from the Divine Tree.

With a motion of his mind he silently informed Li Rong and sank his consciousness into the Black Book Space.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai asked — he did not know why the Divine Tree would call him now.

“Something strange is here,” the Divine Tree replied.

“Those two jet-black stones again?” Yang Kai glanced toward the jet-black spheres and found them unchanged, still absorbing the essence of nearby minerals; the luminous veins across their surfaces had become even more pronounced and coherent.

“Not them — it’s something else. Wait and you’ll see!” the Divine Tree answered.

Yang Kai stopped asking and waited.

After a moment, in a corner of the Black Book Space a glimmer suddenly flashed.

“Huh?” Yang Kai felt odd and hurried his consciousness to the spot where the light flickered; when he discovered what was emitting it, he froze.

Yang Kai knew what was kept in the Black Book Space. The most precious were the Wan Yao Ling Milk series, then the Divine Tree, and the Moonlight Herb he had once sought.

Many secret treasures obtained during his travels were also stored there, though they weren’t of much value and he had never paid them much mind.

Apart from those, there were only the two strange jet-black spheres and the minerals taken from the starry sky.

And now, the thing flashing was something Yang Kai had never expected.

The Heavenly Journey Palace!

The wondrous secret treasure that belonged to Meng Wuya.

Back when the Yang family in Zhongdu fought the succession war, at the climax of that conflict the Cangyun Evil Land launched a massive invasion; the Evil Lord Yang Bai, leading the Six Great Evil Kings, stormed toward the war city.

In an instant the war city was ravaged, its people slaughtered; cries echoed across the plain and it became a dead city.

Amid the ruins, only Yang Kai’s manor remained intact, untouched by the devastation.

It was all thanks to the secret treasure Meng Wuya produced.

The Heavenly Journey Palace transformed into a barrier that shrouded Yang Kai’s manor, leaving the formidable Yang Bai and the evil kings helpless.

Afterwards there was a final subterranean battle in Zhongdu; Yang Bai met a miserable end, the earth vein ruptured, and at that desperate moment Meng Wuya took Xia Ningshang and Su Yan through a Void Passage back to the Tongxuan Continent.

The Heavenly Journey Palace was left behind at Yang Kai’s manor and was ultimately stored in the Black Book Space.

Because it was Meng Wuya’s secret treasure, Yang Kai had never intended to refine it or erase its soul and life marks; he meant to return it when he met Meng Wuya again.

It had sat in the Black Book Space for many years, and if not for the Divine Tree’s reminder today Yang Kai might have nearly forgotten it.

Why was the Heavenly Journey Palace flashing? Though the flicker was slow, it was real, as if responding to something from afar.

Pondering this, Yang Kai’s expression changed as he considered a possibility he dared not be certain of.

— Meng Wuya is here too, or at least he was here before!

The Heavenly Journey Palace was his secret treasure and bore his soul imprint; if Meng Wuya’s aura was present here, that would explain the Palace’s reaction.

Yes — from what he had learned earlier, Meng Wuya had once taken Xia Ningshang and Su Yan to the Ice Sect, entrusted Su Yan to Ice Lord Qing Ya, and then disappeared.

Later the master and disciple appeared in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land was not far from here; if Meng Wuya had come here for some reason and passed by the Nine Heavens Sacred Land on his way rather than visiting the old Saint Lord on purpose, everything made sense.

The more Yang Kai thought, the more convinced he became, and his spirits lifted.

If Meng Wuya is here, then Little Senior Sister must be here too…

Li Rong’s soft voice came at that moment, and Yang Kai quickly returned his consciousness to his body, his eyes brightening.

Lei Long watched his expression and barked, “Kid, did you find something?”

“I don’t know.” Yang Kai grinned and promptly retrieved the Heavenly Journey Palace from the Black Book Space, placing it in his palm. “I don’t know if this counts as a discovery.”

Lei Long frowned, studying the Heavenly Journey Palace. “This treasure looks strange — modeled like a palace. It reminds me of one I know.”

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise. “Which one?”

“A secret treasure owned by a human expert who died in battle centuries ago. Never mind.” Lei Long waved dismissively, but as he probed briefly with his divine sense his expression changed and he said in a low voice, “This treasure, how…”

The treasure’s grade was extremely high, likely an Upper-Level Saint-Grade item, and the remaining aura on it did not belong to Yang Kai but to someone else.

That faint trace of aura was rich and full; Lei Long could tell its owner must be a top-tier expert.

“This is the Heavenly Journey Palace?” Lei Long asked solemnly, uncertain.

A palace-shaped treasure was rare, and its high grade made Lei Long suddenly think of a possibility.

Surely it couldn’t be such a coincidence. Lei Long’s face turned grave.

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “You know it?”

“Is this truly the Heavenly Journey Palace?” Lei Long trembled and looked at Yang Kai in disbelief. “Kid, where did you get this?”

“Lei Long, is this treasure that extraordinary?” Earth-Splitting Divine Ox craned his neck to ask.

Lei Long drew a breath. “Whether the treasure itself is extraordinary matters less — the key is that its original owner was extraordinary.”

“Who was its owner?” Earth-Splitting Divine Ox seemed less learned than Lei Long and knew little about the Heavenly Journey Palace.

“Its owner was the greatest human expert of that era, Meng Wuya!” Lei Long declared in a low voice, his gaze burning on Yang Kai, as if trying to judge whether Yang Kai had any connection to Meng Wuya.

Earth-Splitting Divine Ox scratched his head. “I think I’ve heard that name before.”

“Of course you’ve heard of him.” Lei Long snorted. “Remember Great Lord Blood Jiao?”

“I remember.” Earth-Splitting Divine Ox nodded heavily. “Before I transformed, Great Lord Blood Jiao’s name once shook the yao. Later he died somehow. Right, Lei Long, you used to serve under Great Lord Blood Jiao, didn’t you? I faintly recall that.”
