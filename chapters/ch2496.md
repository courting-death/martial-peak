## Chapter 2496 — The Clash of the Great Emperors

"A true hero dares to cut off his own arm!" Wu Kuang stared at Duan Hongchen in amazement. "Impressive, truly impressive. Of all the Great Emperors back then, you were the one I admired most. You haven't disappointed me in the slightest."

Duan Hongchen burst out laughing and said, "Likewise, likewise. You are the one I admire most."

Wu Kuang sighed with emotion, "After all these years, it's remarkable that you've managed to remain at the Dao Origin Realm."

"That's where you're wrong," Duan Hongchen slowly raised a finger and shook it, his voice solemn. "I never deliberately tried to maintain any cultivation. I simply severed my own cultivation countless times!"

"Countless times..." Wu Kuang exclaimed in shock, truly astonished. "You were able to cultivate back every time? Without damaging your foundation?"

Duan Hongchen replied lightly, "Thanks for your concern. There were indeed a few times when things got truly dangerous, but I managed to pull through each one. I remember once, I made a mistake and completely lost all my cultivation in an instant. It took me two thousand years to painstakingly rebuild everything from scratch. Those two thousand years... were far from pleasant."

As if recalling that incident, a faint look of lingering fear appeared on Duan Hongchen's face.

Wu Kuang muttered blankly, "Was it really worth it for you to do all this...?"

Duan Hongchen's expression turned stern as he shouted, "It was worth it! As long as I could enter the Shattered Star Sea and find you, to utterly destroy your Divine Soul, anything was worth it."

Wu Kuang's eyes flashed sharply as he said in a deep voice, "It seems you truly hate this Lord."

Duan Hongchen smiled faintly and said, “I cannot say I bear you any great hatred. Each person walks their own path; when the Dao differs, there is no point in traveling together. It’s just that Green Lotus, Origin Cauldron, Martial Flame, and Vast Sea are all dead. If you alone were to live on… that would be rather improper.”

"So you're here to avenge those old friends," Wu Kuang nodded, looking as if he understood everything.

Duan Hongchen sighed softly and said, "Endless cycles of vengeance—when will it end? I also find this troublesome. Why don't you just stop resisting and let me send you to meet those old friends!"

Wu Kuang snorted coldly, "Back then, this Lord was nearly destroyed by you all. If not for faking death at the last moment, how could I have survived to awaken today? This Lord believed everything was done flawlessly. How did you know I was still alive?"

Duan Hongchen said solemnly, "Your methods were indeed impressive. Almost everyone was fooled and thought you were truly dead. But did you forget, there was someone who could see through fate, see the past and the future? It was he who told me you might not be dead, and warned me to be on guard."

Wu Kuang's eyes flashed wildly as he growled, "Tianshu!"

Duan Hongchen nodded, "That's right, Tianshu! So every time the Shattered Star Sea opened, I would come in to take a look. Tens of thousands of years have passed, and everything was peaceful—until now. I never expected that this time, you couldn't resist and planned to rise again."

Wu Kuang snorted coldly, "It wasn't that I couldn't bear the loneliness—it's simply that the time had come! The ability to discern fate, to see the past and glimpse the future—this Lord possesses it as well. Whatever Tianshu could see, so can I. And what Tianshu could not see, I can still perceive. Since I chose to awaken at this moment, I will not repeat the mistakes of the past!"

Duan Hongchen said in a deep voice, "Then let's see how much of your former strength you still have."

Wu Kuang laughed loudly, "Even if I have only one percent of my former strength, so what? In your current state, how can you stop me?"

"One percent. Wu Kuang, you've learned to boast. Your body isn't even fully formed yet. I fear you can't even bring out one percent of your strength. I don't need to fight you—if I just cut off this blood, I can stop your resurrection!"

"Duan Hongchen, you truly want to be this Lord's enemy!" Wu Kuang roared in fury.

Duan Hongchen said sternly, "It is you who are the enemy of the world, the enemy of all living things. If you are reborn, the Star Realm will fall into chaos!"

Wu Kuang sneered, "You were always content to play in the mortal world, but now you pretend to care for all living things? Duan Hongchen, if you dare stand in my way, then this place shall be your grave!"

"Since I came in, I never planned to leave alive!" Duan Hongchen's face was resolute. Suddenly, his hands formed a seal, and he shouted, "Break!"

In an instant, his aura soared to its limit, and it showed no sign of stopping, continuing to rise higher and higher...

Boom...

A visible shockwave erupted from the Mortal Great Emperor's body, sweeping in all directions and causing the blood to churn violently. At the same time, Duan Hongchen's cultivation broke through from the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm to the First Stage of the Emperor Realm.

This breakthrough was as simple as piercing a layer of paper—utterly unbelievable. There was not even a trace of Heaven-and-Earth Energy Baptism. It happened in the blink of an eye.

"Good, good, good! The higher your cultivation, the more useful you'll be when I devour you!" Wu Kuang, seeing Duan Hongchen break through on the spot, was not alarmed but delighted. He shouted, and a profound intent of devouring everything erupted, instantly enveloping Duan Hongchen.

The surrounding blood seemed to be drawn by some force, madly converging toward Wu Kuang's skeleton.

Heaven Devouring Domain!

Watching from afar, Yang Kai immediately recognized this as the Heaven Devouring Domain.

He had seen this move before when fighting Wu Mengchuan. Within the Heaven Devouring Domain, all things are devoured—even mysterious laws and profound intents are not spared. But the Heaven Devouring Domain unleashed by Wu Kuang was on a completely different level from Wu Mengchuan's. It truly had the power to devour the world. Just watching it made one feel insignificant.

Duan Hongchen was instantly engulfed by the Heaven Devouring Domain. His aura plummeted, and his face changed dramatically. Pressing his palms together, he thrust them forward with a low chant, "Boundless Mortal World, Three Thousand Afflictions!"

A massive imprint slammed downward. Even before the attack landed, it had already stirred the blood into towering waves.

Wu Kuang's eyes narrowed as he said in a deep voice, "Not bad, not bad. You have a bit of your former self, but defeating this Lord is impossible. Heaven Devouring Battle Art! Devour!"

As his words fell, the skeleton seemed to become a bottomless pit, devouring not only all the surrounding blood but also drawing in Duan Hongchen's secret technique, absorbing it completely.

Wu Kuang burst out laughing, his laughter full of disdain.

Duan Hongchen's face remained calm as still water. He desperately urged his Emperor Yuan, maintaining his secret technique and standing his ground.

After a moment, Wu Kuang's body trembled, and the blood flowing into his skeleton suddenly stopped. Not only that, but the newly formed flesh fell to the ground, turning into a pool of filth. He roared in anger, "Old thing, you dare to trick me!"

Duan Hongchen chuckled, "Keep devouring! Why stop? Isn't your Heaven Devouring Battle Art supposed to devour all things under heaven? Why did you stop?"

Wu Kuang shouted angrily, "What kind of profound intent is hidden in your secret technique that it could secretly harm this Lord? Unforgivable!"

Duan Hongchen snorted coldly, "Do you think all these tens of thousands of years of severing my cultivation were just to enter the Shattered Star Sea to find you? Since I bear the title of the Mortal, naturally I have to struggle and comprehend the power of the mortal world. I am no longer the man I was!"

"The power of the mortal world, the might of heaven and earth?" Wu Kuang's eyes flashed as if he realized something. He growled, "You've actually comprehended a trace of the might of the Heaven and Earth! No wonder you're so confident!"

"Wu Kuang, this time you will surely die. Stop resisting!"

"What a joke! No one in this world can kill this Lord! This Lord is the Heavens, this Lord is the Earth. Whoever resists this Lord defies the will of Heaven and Earth and will be rejected by all Laws!"

Duan Hongchen shook his head, "Wu Kuang, you've lost your mind in your sleep. Under the Heavens, all living things are ants. How dare you compare yourself to the Heavens? Even the Heavenly Dao will not tolerate you!"

"I am the one who devours the Heavens. The Heavenly Dao cannot contain me!"

These two Great Emperors—one with an incomplete body, the other having severed his own cultivation—were both far from their peak. Yet in this bizarre world, their life-and-death struggle was fierce and unrestrained. As their energies clashed, so did their words, shaking the very heavens and earth.

Each phrase sounded ordinary, but seemed to contain profound truths, stirring the patterns of the Heavenly Dao. When they reached Yang Kai's ears, his mind was shaken, and the energy within him surged uncontrollably.

This was the Dao!

This was the Heavenly Dao that countless martial artists pursued in vain!

The two Great Emperors were secretly clashing with their own Daos, each trying to suppress the other. In such a contest, whoever had the firmer heart and deeper understanding of the Dao would undoubtedly gain the upper hand.

Yang Kai was instantly immersed, savoring every word. He felt that everything they said was a priceless gem, full of wisdom, and he benefited greatly.

Suddenly, Yang Kai's heart stirred, and a look of realization appeared on his face, as if he had figured something out.

At that moment, the energy within him also reached its peak.

Yang Kai was startled, snapping out of his comprehension. His face changed as he muttered, "This is bad!"

He hadn't expected to sense the opportunity for a breakthrough at this moment.

Since entering the Shattered Star Sea, nearly three years had passed. Recently, he had seen many newly advanced Emperor Realm cultivators and fought with quite a few. Although he was confident he was no weaker than any of them, he was still only at the Dao Origin Realm.

Without reaching the right realm, one could never be called an Emperor.

He had always been searching for an opportunity to break through, but such things could not be rushed. When the time came, it would happen naturally. If not, forcing it would be fruitless.

And now, that opportunity suddenly descended upon Yang Kai.

If it were anywhere else, Yang Kai would have been overjoyed.

He had long since prepared himself for advancing to the Emperor Realm. His Origin Qi was already showing signs of transforming into Emperor Yuan. For him, becoming an Emperor was only a matter of time.

But... not far from him, two Great Emperors were locked in a life-and-death battle. How could he calmly advance? If he were caught up in their fight, the consequences would be unimaginable.

He tried to suppress the breakthrough, but found it utterly impossible—the urge only grew stronger and stronger. If he forced it down any further, he might very well shatter his foundation and lose all his cultivation.
