## Chapter 1549 — Pill Guide

In the warship, Yang Kai had repeated this sequence countless times, each step impressed clearly upon his mind.

He told himself there was not the slightest flaw in his control of stove heat or the timing of ingredient additions, yet for some reason he still could not refine a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill.

And now he entertained an exceedingly bold conjecture; whether it could truly be realized remained to be proven, so he proceeded with utmost caution, daring not give the slightest neglect.

One by one Void King-Grade ingredients were placed into the Purple Void Cauldron and, under the tempering of Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire and with various spirit-array aids, those materials dissolved into medicinal liquids, merged and gathered together, producing strange and subtle transformations among them.

Yang Kai's expression grew ever more focused and his motions of adding ingredients more careful; spirit arrays formed beneath the brush of his Divine Sense Fire and imprinted into the Purple Void Cauldron to assist the refinement.

Everything proceeded in orderly fashion, with no errors.

Time slipped by bit by bit, and a fine sweat began to bead on Yang Kai's brow.

Refining a Void King-Grade Pill was a tremendous trial for him; it demanded not only perfect control of Divine Sense power but also a heavy weight upon the mind.

The pressure on him was like a mountain.

A faint fragrance drifted from the Purple Void Cauldron — the medicinal liquids mingling perfectly and changing for the better — yet Yang Kai did not let his guard down.

In the two years he had spent on the warship, countless times had he smelled herbs from the Purple Void Cauldron, but never once had a successful Spiritual Pill been produced; every attempt ended in failure and a charred stench.

Now he had reached the most critical moment of the refinement.

As the proverb goes, one who travels a hundred li falters at ninety; Yang Kai's nostrils trembled slightly as he sensed the shifting fragrance, searching within it for the right opportunity.

The scent thickened rapidly. Within a hundred zhang all around it seemed to be suffused with that unique medicinal aroma, filling one with a refreshing ease.

At a certain instant, when the aroma reached its pinnacle, a sharp gleam burst from Yang Kai's eyes.

Now!

He extended a hand and cupped the void. A sphere of intersecting gold and crimson light appeared in his palm. Within that orb was the faintly scaled shadow of a demonic beast, reduced by countlessfold, bouncing about inside the light.

A Blood Beast!

It was precisely the Blood Beast Yang Kai had just condensed using his Golden Blood Threads.

He lifted the lid of the Purple Void Cauldron and, with a flick, tossed the Blood Beast into the cauldron.

Soundlessly, under the overwhelming might of his Divine Sense Fire, the Blood Beast dissipated in an instant and thoroughly merged into the medicinal liquid within the cauldron.

A faint metallic tang of blood mingled with the fragrance, and rather than feeling out of place, the blood scent enhanced the aroma, making it that much richer.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened; he felt he had grasped the crucial point. Without slackening, he urged his Divine Sense Fire to continue tempering the medicine.

The insights gleaned from the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy transformed into capital for his refining at this moment; his movements flowed like clouds and water, without the slightest hesitation.

The Blood Beast, condensed from Golden Blood Threads and the flesh-and-blood essence of the demonic beast, completely dissolved and became part of the medicinal liquid.

The Purple Void Cauldron suddenly trembled as if some unknowable change had occurred within. Yang Kai's expression shifted and he hurried to suppress it with his Divine Sense Fire.

Hissing sounds swelled; within the Purple Void Cauldron it seemed something living was struggling and striking the cauldron walls, seeking escape.

Yang Kai remained unmoved.

Only after the time of half a tea-serving did the movement within the cauldron slowly subside.

Yang Kai withdrew his Divine Sense Fire, drew a deep breath, and looked at the Purple Void Cauldron with grave, hesitant eyes.

Whether success or failure would follow, the outcome would be revealed next. He did not know if this attempt had succeeded, but at least there was no longer the smell of burning as before, which was a good start.

After long hesitation, Yang Kai reached his hand toward the Purple Void Cauldron.

Whether you stick your neck out or pull it back, the blade will still fall—might as well face it head-on.

Yang Kai lifted the cauldron's lid, and at that instant a stream of light suddenly shot out from within, spiraled once, and attempted to flee into the distance.

"Where do you think you're going!" Yang Kai barked, sending his hand after the streak; lightning fast, he seized it in his palm.

It was warm and smooth as jade to the touch, and he could still feel a resistance and struggle in his palm, but it soon calmed, as if the thing in his hand had resigned itself.

He relaxed his grip and examined it closely.

A pill of pale silver, about the size of a longan, met his eyes. It lacked the strong aroma of the refining process; even when he brought it near he could only catch a faint, delicate fragrance, yet this scent felt entirely different from before.

It made one even more refreshed and at ease.

A Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill! Divine Sense probing confirmed that the medicinal potency emitted by this pill was undoubtedly Void King-Grade; although only Lower-Level in rank, its quality was exceptionally high.

A delighted smile crept across Yang Kai's face; he inspected it carefully and after a long while burst into loud laughter.

He finally understood what it meant for a pill to have spirit, to be called a Spiritual Pill.

This very Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill before him was the best proof.

Golden Blood Threads possessed spirit, and the Blood Beast forged from Golden Blood Threads likewise held spirit. Using a Blood Beast as a Pill Guide to refine a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill had not disappointed him.

If before refining he had only guessed this, now the idea had been confirmed.

Pills do not possess spirit for no reason. Even the finest Void King-Grade ingredients could not have spirit unless they were Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects that had developed some semblance of sentience.

In that case, use something that has spirit to refine with.

Pill Guide! With a Pill Guide, Yang Kai could refine Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills!

The Blood Beast had been the Pill Guide for the pill in his hand.

Yang Kai had been the one to notice how spirited the Blood Beast was, and upon testing it, it indeed worked.

He didn't know how other Void King-Grade alchemists refined their pills, but this method he had realized was unquestionably viable; the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy had not explicitly pointed this path out — it was wholly his own invention.

A thousand alchemists studying the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy might come away with a thousand different insights.

Yang Kai had discovered his own alchemical path within the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

The pill in his hand was merely an High Clarity Three Origins Pill that could increase cultivation, and among Void King-Grade items its rank was not particularly high; its value was respectable but not heaven-defying.

At least, it was somewhat wasteful to use a Blood Beast condensed from a strand of Golden Blood Threads as its Pill Guide.

Though the method was workable, if he truly relied on it to refine pills in the future, his Golden Blood Threads would soon be exhausted.

He could not afford such consumption.

How to improve it?

Yang Kai was not satisfied just yet; instead, he fell into deep thought.

Soon he developed a new idea.

The Blood Beast was full of spirit and could serve as a Pill Guide; purely the Golden Blood Threads or even his Golden Blood itself likewise brimmed with spirit and should also be capable of the task.

Perhaps… the spirit essence of a demonic beast could also work.

Where thought led, action followed — Yang Kai immediately set aside distractions and began to verify his idea.

Half a day later another High Clarity Three Origins Pill was born in Yang Kai's hand, this one refined using his Golden Blood as the guide.

Comparing the two pills side by side, Yang Kai noticed that the first High Clarity Three Origins Pill seemed to hold medicinal potency slightly higher than that of the second.

Perceiving this, Yang Kai already began to weigh the implications.

He did not continue there, but instead began searching the jungle for appropriately ranked demonic beasts.

A month later Yang Kai held a jade bottle filled with Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills, each pale silver in color.

He had expended considerable effort to create that bottle; just among demonic beasts of Eighth-Tier and above he had killed dozens.

Through his experiments he confirmed that his prior idea was feasible.

Refining Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills did not necessarily require using his Golden Blood as the Pill Guide — any sentient existence that did not conflict with the herbs could serve as the guide!

For example, the spirit essence of a demonic beast.

Yang Kai possessed the World-Ending Demon Eye, and with the Glazed Light's might fused within it, restraining a demonic beast's spirit essence was no problem; extracting a demonic beast's spirit essence from its body and integrating it into the medicinal materials could make a pill possess spirit.

However, Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills demanded a high standard for the Pill Guide: a Seventh-Tier demonic beast's spirit essence was completely insufficient, Eighth-Tier merely passable, while Ninth-Tier was the ideal choice. If he could obtain a Tenth-Tier demonic beast's spirit essence, Yang Kai believed he could refine a Spiritual Pill that would bear Pill Patterns!

Besides demonic beast spirit essences, Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects that had developed sentience could also serve as Pill Guides.

The grade of the Pill Guide directly affected the chance of successful formation. After many failures, Yang Kai summarized this experience.

He reaped great gains!

After a month of arduous exploration, the birth of a bottle of Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills consumed countless materials, and it signified his complete promotion to Void King-Grade alchemist, standing atop the alchemical path in this star domain.

The method was his own creation and only he could implement it.

Others would find it difficult to seize the spirit essence of a dead demonic beast and fuse it into medicinal materials; therefore even if someone discovered Yang Kai's method, they could not replicate it unless they cultivated similar secret techniques.

The elevation of his alchemical skill deepened his comprehension of the Martial Dao another degree; although his cultivation realm saw little change, his command over his own power increased beyond before.

Having reached the Void King-Grade as an alchemist, Yang Kai's next step was to refine alchemical techniques.

He had always believed that one portion of medicinal material could only produce a single pill.

All these years he had done precisely that.

Yet the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy proposed a different and expansive opinion.

One portion of material could actually yield more than a single pill; with poor fortune producing three to five, and with great fortune producing seven or eight, even reaching the perfect ten.

This notion opened up another vast realm of alchemy before him.

But to achieve such inconceivable results, one must employ a special technique just before the pill forms, requiring vast experience accumulation; it was not something every alchemist could accomplish.
