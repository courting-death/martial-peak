## Chapter 1141 — Momentum

In front of the cave, Yang Kai flung his arms and felt as if invisible threads were winding around him, binding his movements. Not only did they hamper his motions, but his Saint Yuan flowed with extreme obstruction; it was precisely this strange sensation that prevented him from exerting his full strength. When Hong Zhen threw his first punch, Yang Kai had to take out the Purple Shield to defend.

Although the purple Shield hadn’t been fully refined and couldn’t manifest all its functions, it had been forged from the shell and Inner Core of a Ninth-Tier demonic beast combined with various Origin-Grade ores. It was incomparably sturdy; it was entirely normal that it could block Hong Zhen’s attack.

“What kind of power is this?” Yang Kai couldn’t detect what exactly was binding him and could only ask Hong Zhen.

Hong Zhen laughed loudly. “Ignorant brat, you don’t even know what Shi is, yet you dare be so arrogant?”

“Shi?” Yang Kai frowned. “Isn’t that like aura? I have an aura too.”

Saying that, a torrent of power burst forth from him — but to his disappointment, his aura was fundamentally different from Hong Zhen’s. It wasn’t that his aura was weak; on the surface, to anyone unaware of the truth, Yang Kai’s outburst seemed earth-shattering and soul-shaking. By contrast, Hong Zhen’s Shi felt like a fine, gentle drizzle — far less imposing.

Only Yang Kai himself knew that the Shi Hong Zhen spoke of was entirely different from the “aura” he understood — they were two distinct things. His released aura couldn’t affect Hong Zhen in the slightest, while Hong Zhen’s Shi severely suppressed his strength.

Is this the Origin Returning Realm? So formidable. Yang Kai’s eyes burned; instead of panic or discouragement he felt battle-lust surge.

Shaking his head to disperse his excitement, Yang Kai hefted the Purple Shield and shouted at Hong Zhen, "Come on, let me see what your Shi actually is!"

He re-sheathed his Demonic Flame longsword and adopted a defensive stance.

After just one exchange, Yang Kai already knew that with his current combat power it was impossible to kill an Origin Returning Realm cultivator. Even using Golden Blood might not be enough; this thing called Shi was very mysterious. Still, Hong Zhen couldn’t kill him — he had the Purple Shield and could tear space. Even a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm couldn’t take him down.

Seeing Yang Kai’s posture, Hong Zhen knew what he was trying to do and flew into a rage.

The Origin Returning Realm exerted absolute suppression over the Saint King Realm; never had he expected this youth at only the First Stage of the Saint King Realm to want to study his Shi. It felt like an insult. Killing intent overflowed from him and he struck without mercy. Wind Blades were flung out, countless as a plague of locusts, shredding space and issuing sharp howls.

"Fine, fine, fine, tear him to bits for me," Xie Hongwen slapped his hands and laughed, completely forgetting that he had just been boasting about stamping Yang Kai under his foot and urinating on his face.

Wu Yi’s face went pale and she cried out, which only made Xie Hongwen gloat all the more.

Many of the warriors who had followed Wu Yi could no longer bear to watch and turned away in gloom; they figured Yang Kai was done for. There was no way he could survive this round of attacks.

Yang Yan sneered and muttered softly, "If the Secret Treasure I refined can be broken by a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm’s attack, then I won’t refine treasures ever again."

Her voice was so low no one heard it; not even Wu Yi standing beside her.

Boom, boom, boom...

Violent sounds erupted. The ground in Yang Kai’s area was blasted with sand and stone, his vision impeded. His body retreated again and again, slamming heavily into a large rock that shattered into pieces in an instant. A bitter taste filled Yang Kai’s throat and he spat a mouthful of blood mist.

The Wind Blades failed to wound Yang Kai at all, but the tremendous concussive force still left his organs displaced.

Hong Zhen’s eyes narrowed; he hadn’t expected the shield’s defensive capability to be so good. Before Yang Kai could recover, Hong Zhen took a step and in the next instant found himself right in front of Yang Kai, swinging his fist at Yang Kai’s forehead.

The motion that was pulling at Yang Kai, suppressing his strength with Shi, suddenly intensified; Yang Kai felt he couldn’t make a defensive move before Hong Zhen’s blow landed.

In desperation, Yang Kai slung out the unfinished Space Blade.

Two spatial rifts rapidly tore toward Hong Zhen’s waist and abdomen. Though Hong Zhen didn’t know what the attack was, he could sense danger. A thick wave of Saint Yuan surged and formed a defense outside his body, yet his fist still slammed down like thunder.

But because of that momentary delay, Yang Kai had already raised the Purple Shield.

A tremendous crash followed and Yang Kai was hurled like a kite with its string cut, flying far away.

Hong Zhen frowned and focused his Divine Sense on the place where he had been struck, only to find there was nothing there and no sign of injury. He shook his head, unable to understand why he had felt such a terrifying illusion a moment ago.

Turning his gaze back to Yang Kai, Hong Zhen was speechless.

This youth at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm looked utterly battered but had not suffered serious injury. All of Hong Zhen’s attacks had been intercepted by that Purple Shield Secret Treasure; the injuries he had were only concussive in nature.

What’s more, he showed no terror or intent to flee; instead he seemed full of interest, his face wearing a pleased smile, and he waved to Hong Zhen.

"As if!" Hong Zhen was livid. For an Origin Returning Realm cultivator to face a Saint King Realm cultivator and fail to kill him in a short time, then be taunted repeatedly — being toyed with like a monkey was something anyone could not tolerate.

His own Shi exploded outward and once again enveloped Yang Kai, but in the next moment Hong Zhen wore an incredulous expression. Around the youth’s body flowed a faint aura similar to Shi. Though very weak, Hong Zhen could be certain it was the budding form of Shi; given enough time, it could form into its own Shi!

How could that be? Only dozens of breaths ago he had been asking him what Shi was, and now he could already do this?

He figured it out just from that brief exchange of blows? The thought made Hong Zhen shudder, a cold sweat breaking out across his back. If that were really the case, then this brat was far too heaven-defying. Even for himself, after advancing to the Origin Returning Realm ten years ago, it had taken the guidance and support of his sect’s elders for him to slowly grasp Shi—and even now, he had only barely stepped through the door, not even reaching true proficiency.

And besides, only those in the Origin Returning Realm could grope toward the threshold of Shi — without entering the Origin Returning Realm one couldn’t touch such a thing.

How had he done it? He could already vaguely understand what Shi was.

"Come on!" Yang Kai saw the shifting expression on Hong Zhen’s face and its many colors and couldn’t help goading, "Stop dawdling, do you want to fight or not?"

It wasn’t just him urging; Xie Hongwen likewise was shouting, constantly clamoring for Hong Zhen to do whatever to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai had no mind to pay them any heed. He couldn’t wait to have a good fight with Hong Zhen, or rather to be soundly beaten.

If he could understand Shi this way, what did it matter to get beaten up?

Hong Zhen drew a light breath and didn’t immediately strike. He suddenly turned his head and said, "Senior Brother, join me. His Secret Treasure is too formidable; I can’t break his defense."

He felt no shame asking; if it were someone else he wouldn’t ask a favor of his senior, but Yang Kai was terrifying. If not slain today, once he grew up he would become an invincible existence.

So he did not hesitate to ask his Senior Brother for help.

Another Origin Returning Realm cultivator who had been guarding beside Xie Hongwen looked at Hong Zhen in surprise but didn’t ask further; he simply nodded, "Fine!"

Saying that, he indeed stepped forward.

Everyone was stunned!

An Origin Returning Realm First Stage cultivator facing a First Stage of the Saint King Realm and yet inviting an assistant — and that assistant was also a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm...

Ian trembled all over. Though he hadn’t understood the situation, he knew Yang Kai was truly not easy to mess with. A very bad feeling arose in him; he didn’t know if this time insulting Yang Kai to death would be a blessing or a curse.

Seeing two Origin Returning Realm cultivators approaching, Yang Kai frowned and disappointment washed over his face as he hurried back to the cave mouth.

One Origin Returning Realm cultivator he couldn’t handle; two together? If he fought them, unless he tore open space to flee, he’d surely be killed.

"Open the formation!" Yang Kai wiped blood from the corner of his mouth, put the Purple Shield away, and called to Yang Yan.

"Alright!" Yang Yan nodded and traced a few strange seals into the formation outside the cave. In an instant ripples spread through the space outside the cave, but soon subsided back to calm.

Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother’s faces grew grave, their Divine Sense sweeping constantly, but to their surprise, before the formation had been activated they could feel some danger. After the formation was opened, however, they could sense nothing; their Divine Sense could sweep the area completely with no anomaly. Yet everyone knew that once someone fell into the formation there would be no good outcome.

"What are you hesitating for? Break that formation and drag those two women over for me!" Xie Hongwen hollered.

The two Origin Returning Realm cultivators were helpless; they finally produced their Secret Treasures and ferociously attacked the open space in front of the cave.

Both of their Secret Treasures were not low in grade; they were all Lower-Level Origin-Grade Secret Treasures. Hong Zhen used twelve flying-knife-like Secret Treasures, each throwing knife of Saint King-Grade Upper-Level quality; combined into a line they became even higher in grade and bombarded the formation’s position incessantly.

Hong Zhen’s Senior Brother’s Secret Treasure was even more powerful: an octagonal nail-hammer. Every time it struck the formation’s position the earth shook and mountains trembled.

The formation Yang Yan had set was usually invisible, but when attacked it would show some traces. Those who break formations without understanding them resort to brute force; nearly ninety-nine percent of cultivators deal with arrays this way — laborious, thankless, and sometimes the array would lash back at the breaker. Only a very few who understand formations seek the array’s gate and elegantly break it.
