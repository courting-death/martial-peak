## Chapter 2175 — Lying in Wait

This was the Inner Core of a Demonic Beast at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and it was a Demonic Beast skilled in Divine Soul power. Using it to refine Spiritual Pills that enhance the Divine Soul would make it the best possible raw material.

Yang Kai put it away into his Spatial Ring, then leisurely walked over to the altar.

There were no restrictions or traces of arrays on the altar, and the green bead was simply placed there.

After confirming for a long while, Yang Kai finally reached out and picked it up. Unexpectedly, it went smoothly.

Releasing his Divine Sense to probe, he could not sense any power fluctuations from the bead, and even after infusing Origin Qi, there was no reaction at all—everything was just like with the other fiery red bead!

He also did not know how that strange beast had managed to draw out the energy from the green bead to heal itself.

Next, he took out the fiery red bead and compared the two, finding that, just as he had observed, the two beads were exactly the same size, only differing in color.

After observing for a long time, he could only slowly shake his head.

He simply could not deduce the specific use of these two beads, so he could only put them away helplessly.

But just as he put the green bead into his Spatial Ring, a sudden change occurred.

The lake, which had been cold but showed no signs of freezing, suddenly echoed with cracking sounds from all directions, as if an omnipresent chill was sweeping in. The lake began to freeze over.

Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly, and he quickly leapt upward.

When he had completely left the water and looked down from high above, he saw that the entire lake had frozen solid, no longer reflecting the shimmering waves from before.

“It seems that it was precisely because of the green bead’s presence... that this lake avoided being frozen.” Yang Kai speculated inwardly, not knowing what kind of mysterious power was hidden within the green bead to actually ward off the severe cold.

After thinking for a while, Yang Kai turned and flew toward the shore.

When he returned, Liu Yan only nodded at him slightly without saying much, but Little Snowflake was extremely happy, circling around Yang Kai nonstop.

“Let’s continue.” Yang Kai said to Little Snowflake. The other party seemed to understand his meaning and immediately flew off in a certain direction.

In the days that followed, Yang Kai kept moving about in the Winter Domain.

With Little Snowflake’s guidance and searching, any heaven-and-earth treasure nearby could not escape its detection, and naturally, all of them ended up in Yang Kai’s Spatial Ring.

Yang Kai’s thinking was simple. Since the Mortal Great Emperor had specifically instructed Qin Chaoyang to come to the Four Seasons Land to search for the Calamity Fruit, it could not be without reason. In other words, there must be such a spirit fruit in the Four Seasons Land. He just had not found it yet.

But as long as he was patient, he would eventually find it, and now, with Little Snowflake’s help, he had a unique advantage.

He secretly resolved that he would not leave the Winter Domain until he found the Calamity Fruit. Otherwise, if he left the Four Seasons Land, he would have no way to explain himself to Qin Chaoyang.

To his disappointment, he obtained many Spiritual Herbs and wondrous medicines, but there was still no sign of the Calamity Fruit. He also slew many Demonic Beasts, but apart from collecting some Inner Cores, he did not even get a single Star Seal.

As time passed, Yang Kai could not help but grow anxious.

One day, in the middle of an icy plain, Yang Kai stood beneath a layer of ice, looking ahead at a crystal-clear fruit tree with a grim expression.

The fruit tree was about as tall as a person, its leaves like blocks of ice, exuding a  biting chill.

There was nothing on the tree, but at a certain branch, there was a clear sign that a fruit had been picked.

“I miscalculated, someone beat me to it!” Yang Kai’s face was full of frustration.

This tree was unmistakably a Calamity Fruit tree. Guided by Little Snowflake, Yang Kai had spent ten whole days searching every inch of the land before finally discovering this rare tree.

But the Calamity Fruit that should have been on it had already been taken by someone else!

Judging from the picking mark, there had been a spirit fruit on the tree just a few days ago.

“Master, you did your best, there’s no need to blame yourself...” Liu Yan quickly comforted Yang Kai when she saw his unhappy expression.

“Right now, I just want to know... who took the spirit fruit.” Yang Kai frowned deeply.

Although the Calamity Fruit was rare and precious, its uses were not widespread. Even if someone else took it, it might not be truly useful to them. If he could find out who took it, Yang Kai could offer a suitable treasure in exchange.

As long as the other party was not unreasonable, they would likely be happy to make the trade. At worst, Yang Kai could just offer a bit more.

But as things stood, Yang Kai had no idea who had taken the Calamity Fruit! This made his plan impossible to carry out.

“Are there any more of these fruit trees in the Winter Domain?” Yang Kai turned and asked Little Snowflake hopefully.

Little Snowflake’s indistinct features appeared, and it slowly shook its head.

Yang Kai’s last bit of hope was dashed.

He sighed softly and fell into thought.

After the Four Seasons Land opened, the cultivators who entered could stay for thirty-three days. When the time was up, they had to rush to a specific location to leave, or else they would be trapped inside.

Counting the days, it had been nearly twenty days since he entered, and more than half of that time had been spent in the Winter Domain.

From here to the exit would take several days, so he did not have much time left.

Moreover, he had already searched almost the entire Winter Domain, and most of the Spiritual Herbs and wondrous medicines were already in his possession. Now that the Calamity Fruit had been taken, there was no point in staying any longer.

It would be better to head to the exit and wait for the disciples of the various Sects to return, looking for a chance to inquire about the Calamity Fruit’s whereabouts. There might still be a slim chance!

With this thought, Yang Kai immediately made up his mind and turned to Little Snowflake, saying, “Take us out of here!”

“Master is leaving?” Liu Yan’s beautiful eyes flashed as she asked.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded.

Liu Yan naturally had no objections, but Little Snowflake seemed a bit reluctant. After spending this time together, this lonely being had experienced so much joy, and now that they were parting, it was naturally a little unwilling.

Yang Kai grinned and said in an encouraging tone, “If you want, you can come with me!”

Upon hearing this, Little Snowflake’s tightly furrowed features relaxed, as if showing a joyful expression, but soon it drooped again, looking dispirited.

Liu Yan softly said, “It cannot leave the Winter Domain... It’s different from me. This land is where it was born, its roots are here. If it leaves, it won’t survive for long.”

“How could that be?” Yang Kai was stunned.

Liu Yan explained, “If it leaves here, it’s like me leaving my vessel... A rootless tree, water without a source, cannot survive for long. Unless...”

“Unless what?” Yang Kai asked.

“Unless there is a similar environment inside the Small Xuan Realm, then it could survive.” Liu Yan replied.

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately realized his plan to take Little Snowflake away had failed. He had thought he could settle it in the Small Xuan Realm, but now he knew he had been too naive.

Thinking this, Yang Kai reached out, picked up Little Snowflake, and placed it on his shoulder, smiling, “Don’t be so down. If I get the chance, I’ll come back to see you! Maybe next time, I’ll find a way to take you with me!”

Though he said this, Yang Kai knew it was basically impossible. Who knew how many years it would be before the Four Seasons Land opened again? Even if it did, he might not be able to enter.

After all, by that time, he might have already ascended to the Emperor Realm…

But Little Snowflake did not think so much. It was just a wondrous thing born of heaven and earth, with a simple mind. A few words were enough to lift its spirits, and it became happy again.

This made Yang Kai feel quite guilty...

Leaving the icy plain, it took four whole days before Yang Kai saw the Two Seasons Mountain. Although he gained a little along the way, it was not much.

When they arrived, Little Snowflake would go no further.

At this point, Little Snowflake would go no further. 

Yang Kai and Liu Yan bid it farewell, a trace of sorrow lingering in their hearts... but such feelings are best left unspoken.

Crossing the Two Seasons Mountain, Yang Kai headed straight for the exit.

Before entering the Four Seasons Land, the elders of every Sect had already instructed their disciples to reach the exit before the time limit.

The location of the exit was clear—it was at the very center of the Four Seasons Land!

So Yang Kai was not worried about going the wrong way.

Three days later, Yang Kai smoothly arrived at a plain, and from a great distance, he saw the exit of the Four Seasons Land.

The exit, like the entrance at the nameless valley, was an oval-shaped light gate, quietly standing in midair.

Cultivators who entered the Four Seasons Land could leave at any time through this light gate.

But since the time limit had not yet arrived, obviously no one would leave early.

As expected, when Yang Kai arrived, the place was empty.

By his calculations, there were only about five or six days left until the time limit.

Yang Kai did not plan to explore other places in the Four Seasons Land. He intended to stay here, in case someone left early and took the Calamity Fruit without him knowing.

While waiting, he also considered what he could use to trade if he really found out who had the Calamity Fruit.

He had countless precious items, but many were things he could not part with, like the five Imperial Treasures. Such things could not be traded.

He still had a few Dao Origin Pills left from the last time he refined them, but those were only useful to peak Void King Realm cultivators. Dao Origin Realm cultivators might not care for them.

He had gained quite a bit inside the Four Seasons Land, and perhaps he could offer some of those, but others might not value them.

After thinking it over, he set his sights on a drop of Immortal Source Liquid, secretly feeling that this was a bargaining chip no one could refuse.
