## Chapter 1992 — Princess Lan Xun

By the second day, word that the Star God Palace's Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda was about to be opened had indeed spread throughout Fenglin City.

Countless martial artists were elated and cheered, praising the Star God Palace for its generosity, though a small number of Dao Origin Realm experts were seething with resentment — after all, this opening of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda had nothing to do with them.

For a time, Fenglin City's Alchemy shops, Secret Treasure shops, and many other stores were overflowing with people.

Two days later the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda was opened, and martial artists hurried to make exhaustive preparations, sparing no expense—buying up vast stocks of life‑preserving and restorative Spiritual Pills, and even gritting their teeth to buy Secret Treasures they had once been reluctant to purchase.

A craftsman must first sharpen his tools to do his work well; every martial artist understood this simple truth.

If they hoped to gain anything within the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda and still leave with their lives, they had to make even more comprehensive preparations.

Mo Xiaoqi had clearly received the news and was very interested; she even used a sound bead to notify Yang Kai, arranging to enter the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda with him two days later.

Yang Kai agreed at once, feeling a little guilty in his heart.

Mo Xiaoqi had come to inform him the moment she learned of it, yet he had long since known and had forgotten to notify Mo Xiaoqi in return.

If she wanted to go into the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, Yang Kai certainly would not stop her.

Though the girl was simple and even naive, she was a walking treasure, prickly like a hedgehog; within the Void King Realm probably no one could do anything to her.

Yang Kai continued to concentrate on refining pills.

Meanwhile, at the City Lord's Mansion.

In a certain secret chamber, a man and a woman sat cross-legged, facing each other three zhang apart.

The man was about forty, his aura deep and unfathomable. He looked stern and dignified, wearing a black robe, and on his chest a pattern of innumerable stars had been embroidered in silver thread; though the stars were inanimate, they seemed real, flickering here and there in mysterious wonder.

A Star Envoy!

Only a Star Envoy of the Star God Palace would dare wear such attire; the silver-threaded emblem was the hallmark of a Star Envoy.

Within the Star God Palace the Star Envoys were divided into three ranks: from highest to lowest, Gold Star Envoy, Silver Star Envoy, and Bronze Star Envoy; even the lowest Bronze Star Envoy required an Emperor Realm expert to hold the post.

That man of about forty was a Silver Star Envoy, indicating his cultivation had already reached the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm.

And the legendary Gold Star Envoy was a Third Stage Emperor!

Over the years the Star God Palace had deployed Gold Star Envoys only on rare occasions; many ordinary Emperor Realm experts had never even seen one. There were only three Gold Star Envoys within the entire Star God Palace, and no one knew where they were or what they were doing.

Facing that Silver Star Envoy sat a woman of twenty, bright-eyed with pearly teeth, brows like a painting, a head of silky, straight black hair; her eyes were like a pool of clear water without a trace of impurity. She wore a blue gown studded with ornate, tiny gemstones, and those gems were no ordinary things — each emitted strange waves of power.

She sat cross-legged, her dark brows slightly knit, a tempest of qi rising and falling within her, at times resonating in faint, uncanny harmony with the laws of heaven and earth.

She was clearly on the verge of a breakthrough!

Her cultivation had reached the peak of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; if she broke through, she would naturally ascend to the Dao Origin Realm.

"Princess, are you all right?" The man of about forty, though a Second Stage Emperor, still spoke with deference when facing this woman, a clear sign of her high status.

The woman lightly nodded and said, "I'm fine for the moment."

"Ah, Princess, you are far too... willful!" The Silver Star Envoy looked vexed. "You actually used a False Face Bead to trick me and left the Star God Palace with me. When we return you'll surely receive a scolding from the Great Emperor."

The woman stuck out her little tongue and teased, "Uncle Xiao, don't be afraid. When the time comes Xun'er will plead for you; you're Father's old brother — he certainly won't truly punish you."

"You?" Xiao Yuyang glanced at Lan Xun and smirked with ill-concealed delight. "You can't even protect yourself now, how can you beg for me? The Great Emperor said that after you return to the palace he'll lock you in confinement for ten years!"

"Ten years?" Lan Xun cried out, wailing, "I'd rather be killed — staying in the palace every day is so boring, that's why I wanted to come out and have a look..."

"Then pick a better time," Xiao Yuyang said helplessly, smiling ruefully. "You clearly knew you were about to break through; why didn't you stay safely inside the palace instead of risking it?"

Lan Xun lowered her head and muttered, "I heard a Divine Spirit had appeared; I've never seen a Divine Spirit, so I came to see the commotion."

“You are a Great Emperor’s daughter—precious beyond measure. Are you really afraid you won’t see a Divine Spirit in the future? If it comes to that, just have the Great Emperor take you to Dragon Isle as a guest; the place is crawling with Divine Spirits.”

"What's so interesting about a few big snakes?" Lan Xun said dismissively.

"A few big snakes..." Xiao Yuyang's mouth twitched. As a Second Stage Emperor he was briefly at a loss for words, then sighed: "Oh well. Now you cannot suppress the qi of your impending breakthrough; sending you back to the Star God Palace is too late. The Great Emperor agreed to let me open an entrance to the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda here, and the Great Emperor will simultaneously activate the real tower over there so you can enter and breakthrough. To conceal the matter, they even declared this to be a gift from the Star God Palace to the martial artists of this city, and only after much persuasion did Tianwu Sacred Land, Wuhua Hall, and Qingyang Shrine agree to help. Otherwise I alone couldn't have pulled this off. But you must be careful. I'll employ a secret art to send you directly to the Third Stage; there you should find a good place to contemplate the Martial Dao and absorb as much of those fragmented heavenly laws and Stellar Origins as possible — it will be of tremendous benefit to your future growth."

"I understand."

"Do you know how to draw in those fragmented laws of heaven and earth and Stellar Origins?"

"Yes, Father taught me before, and I specifically learned a secret technique."

"That's good — though it's a pity... Your Highness isn't of the Star Lord's blood. Had you succeeded years ago in refining that Stellar Origin, you would have gained far greater benefits this time."

Lan Xun smiled and said, "Uncle Xiao isn't of the Star Lord's lineage either, yet you still cultivated to the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. While the Star Lord's status grants many conveniences in cultivation, it is not indispensable. Xun'er is confident she'll one day reach Father's level."

Xiao Yuyang's expression shifted and he laughed heartily, "Good — the Princess has such ambition. It's a pity you're not of the male sex..."

Lan Xun immediately snorted, "So what if I'm not a man? Am I worse than those men?"

"Uh... Uncle Xiao means if you were male, I'd drink and make merry with you!" Xiao Yuyang was quick to change the subject, utterly at ease.

"I don't want to, it's all stinky-smelling; I don't know why anyone would drink that."

Xiao Yuyang did not dwell on the matter, instead speaking seriously: "Princess, the main thing this time is to break through your current Realm. Of course, if time allows you can also test yourself in the Third Stage; there are still many good things and many treasures there — even we old fellows entering might not obtain them. The Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda relies most on fate and fortune; one's strength and Realm are secondary."

"Xun'er will keep that in mind."

...

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

On that day Fenglin City was extremely lively; everyone unconsciously streamed toward the vast square before the City Lord's Mansion. Origin Returning Realm and Void King Realm martial artists were joyful, while most other martial artists wore sullen, gloomy faces.

For this time Dao Origin Realm experts were not permitted to enter the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, and those below the Origin Returning Realm felt they lacked the ability to enter and naturally did not join the crowd; even many Origin Returning Realm cultivators did not dare.

Those daring to enter the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda were people who had placed life and death aside, preparing to seek their fortunes inside.

Some time ago a raised platform had been erected in front of the City Lord's Mansion.

Seated upon it were several martial artists of varying ages.

When the crowd looked toward them, everyone showed reverent and admiring expressions.

After all, those people were Emperor Realm experts; below the Emperor Realm no one qualified to be seated there. Even Duan Yuanshan, the City Lord of Fenglin City, could only bow and stand smiling to the side.

Duan Yuanshan was a Second Stage Dao Origin Realm expert; in ordinary times he was the ruler of Fenglin City, but before these Emperor Realm figures he did not dare draw a deep breath.

Time slipped by quietly.

More and more martial artists gathered.

Everyone craned their necks, searching for the legendary treasure of the Star God Palace — the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda — hoping to catch a glimpse of its true form.

But no matter how they searched, they found nothing.

Those with knowledge of the inside story spread word that the real Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda was not present here, nor carried by the Star Envoy; although this was the Southern Territory and no one dared disrespect the Star God Palace — after all it was the palace's treasure — the tower would not be carried about casually.

This opening relied mainly on the Star Envoy joining with a number of Emperor Realm experts, using great divine powers and cooperating with some masters from the Star God Palace headquarters; together they exerted force to open a passage into the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda.

Thus, even if the actual tower was not here, entry was still possible.

Yang Kai stood among the crowd, listening to nearby martial artists' chatter, and he soon learned of this.

This eased his doubts. He had thought the Star Envoy had brought the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda with him and could not understand why that would be, but now he finally understood.

While he waited, someone patted his shoulder, and Mo Xiaoqi's voice came over: "Eldest Brother!"

Yang Kai turned and saw Mo Xiaoqi smiling by his side, while countless martial artists nearby bared their teeth and looked at her with evident apprehension.
