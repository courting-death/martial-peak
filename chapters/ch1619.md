## Chapter 1619 — Actually Succeeded

Ascending to the Void King Realm does not depend solely on strength; sometimes luck plays a part as well.

Qian Tong's luck was clearly not good.

Although his power exceeded that of an ordinary Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator by a wide margin, and he had reaped much inside the Blood Prison, the baptism of heavenly and terrestrial might he encountered during his ascension was unbelievably fierce.

That he had managed to hold on until now without dying was proof enough of how powerful he truly was.

There was no way he could possibly last until the final moment; the clouds in the sky had only cleared halfway, which meant the Baptism of heavenly-terrestrial might had only reached its midpoint.

No one held out hope for him! Even Luo Hai sighed in regret and withdrew his gaze, paying no further attention.

Though Yang Kai had spoken lightly before, inwardly he couldn’t help but break into a cold sweat for Elder Qian.

He had never encountered such a situation before, so he had no way to judge it.

However, he had faith in Qian Tong, and faith in the thing he had entrusted to Qian Tong!

Ordinary people could not comprehend how keenly the cultivators of Dark Star longed for the Void King Realm; suppressed and constrained by the laws of heaven and earth, Dark Star had not seen a single person reach the Void King Realm in tens of thousands of years, and precisely because of that, the cultivators there yearned all the more for this supreme realm.

In terms of devotion to the Martial Dao, Qian Tong was second to none.

Crack...

Another terrifying wave of heavenly-terrestrial might descended, pouring into Qian Tong's body, washing his meridians and marrow while shredding his flesh.

In that chaotic energy center, Qian Tong's already weak vitality faced the danger of being extinguished!

Lin Yurao cried out, her face paling. She instinctively covered her mouth with her hand.

Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi, Mo Yu and the others likewise changed color!

"It's over, it's over! This really is over." Elder Jiu shook his head and sighed with regret. "This person's luck is poor; otherwise he had a great chance to attain the Void King Realm, but alas... huh? What's this?"

Elder Jiu suddenly widened his eyes and stared straight ahead as if he had discovered something extraordinary.

The other Void King Realm cultivators likewise revealed extreme surprise and began to shout and exclaim.

"No way? Why is this man's qi and blood power frantically rising?"

"Could he have taken some heaven-defying pill? Is there a Spiritual Pill capable of such an effect?"

"Nonsense — what Spiritual Pill could revive a man on the brink of death? Even a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill won't do!"

"Strange. What on earth did he take?"

Many Origin Returning Realm experts were baffled, unable to fathom why Qian Tong's nearly extinguished vitality had sprouted anew like withered wood meeting spring, bursting with astonishing radiance.

That rich force of qi and blood could be felt clearly even while being disturbed by the raging ascension energy.

From afar came Qian Tong’s hearty laughter. His figure stood tall and straight like a sword, proudly rooted upon the earth. Tilting his head to the heavens, he roared with unrestrained spirit, “This old man hasn’t lived enough yet — how could I die in a foreign land? Damn heavens, whatever tricks you’ve got left, bring them on!”

Elder Jiu and the others' faces twitched and their eyes filled with alarm.

This man actually dared to challenge the heavenly-terrestrial might during ascension — in all of history, no one had ever done such a thing.

Did he not know that the heavenly-terrestrial might aroused by an ascension at his level possessed a sentience?

Such provocation was essentially digging his own grave!

Sure enough, as soon as Qian Tong's words fell, the massive clouds above began to whirl violently, and buzzing thunder rolled from within the clouds, shaking people's souls.

In the blink of an eye, a huge vortex appeared above Qian Tong's head.

Immediately after, a thick pillar of energy shot down from that vortex, striking Qian Tong directly!

Qian Tong's harrowing screams and low groans rose again as his boiling vitality was rapidly consumed.

"That old bastard!" Elder Jiu ground his teeth, at a loss for words.

Luo Hai's eyes glittered, and he gazed at that place intently, moved.

The heavenly-terrestrial might seemed to be pouring down; with that energy pillar striking him, the clouds in the sky visibly shrank and thinned.

In less than ten breaths' time, the sky suddenly cleared; the terrifying heavenly-terrestrial might vanished, and the rampant energy dissipated in an instant.

In the distance, only Qian Tong's figure stood straight, utterly motionless!

It was impossible to tell whether he was alive or dead.

Yet a strange, profound intent centered on him erupted outward with a boom, spreading across a hundred li before gradually dissipating.

Then that same intent leisurely withdrew and flowed back into Qian Tong's body.

It seemed as if something had changed...

Many Origin Returning Realm experts frowned, unable to see through the mystery, while those Void King Realm cultivators all raised their brows in surprise.

"He compressed his Shi into a Domain — this man... actually succeeded!" the old woman surnamed Lei murmured.

Yang Kai, who had been watching the Void King Realm cultivators' reactions, chuckled at the remark.

He could not discern the clues from Qian Tong's ascension scene itself and had to rely on these Void King Realm cultivators; hearing Matron Lei say this, he immediately relaxed.

Qian Tong had now genuinely become a Void King Realm expert!

Yet compared with veteran Void King Realm experts like Luo Hai, he still appeared somewhat immature; after all, perfecting a Domain was not achieved in a day or two.

Among the Void King Realm experts here the weakest had ascended five hundred years ago and had half a millennium's experience tempering their Domains.

In other words, in a one-on-one fight, Qian Tong might not hold out for more than three breaths against them!

After some thought, Yang Kai soared into the sky, cupped his fists, and called out loudly, “Everyone, although Elder Qian has now advanced to the Void King Realm, he still needs time to stabilize his state of mind. I must ask that you not linger here. If my words offend, I beg your pardon!”

The numerous cultivators exchanged glances, understanding that Yang Kai meant to disperse them.

Without the previous contempt and indifference, those Origin Returning Realm cultivators turned and left obediently; a few even cupped their hands at Yang Kai from a distance and spoke some polite words.

Previously their disdain came from numbers; but now that Qian Tong had become a Void King Realm cultivator, to provoke him now would be courting death.

No one dared to do so.

"Sirs, you..." Yang Kai looked toward those Void King Realm cultivators with an inquiring expression.

“All right, all right, no need to chase us off — this old man will leave on his own!” Elder Jiu snorted. “But when that friend of yours wakes up, tell him this: we’ll be waiting in a nearby city. He’s just broken through, so there must be much he doesn’t yet understand. If he wishes to ask anything, he may come to us — we won’t be stingy with our guidance.”

"Yes, whatever we can tell him, we will," Matron Lei nodded in agreement.

"Then I will convey thanks on behalf of Elder Qian," Yang Kai bowed respectfully.

The Void King Realm cultivators exchanged glances and then vanished from where they stood.

Yang Kai distinctly saw Luo Hai glance at him intentionally before leaving.

This place was truly no place to linger!

"Brother Yang, I shall take my leave as well; I hope one day fate brings us together again," Xu Binbai cupped his hands to Yang Kai.

"Brother Xu, take care!" Yang Kai nodded. Though he regarded Xu Binbai as a good man worth befriending, this was not the time for making connections, so he did not try to keep him.

Soon, only Yang Kai and his group remained on the noisy wasteland.

Tianze did not leave either; he stared enviously at Qian Tong in the distance and privately regretted that he lacked such ability and insight. He had entered the Blood Prison with Qian Tong and trained there together, yet Qian Tong had succeeded while he only felt his grasp of Shi had greatly improved, with the Void King Realm still a distant prospect.

"City Lord Zhao," Yang Kai called as he walked up to Tianze.

"Sect Master Yang, any orders?" Tianze asked.

"Orders is too grand a word — it's just that... we will likely depart soon."

"Leave?" Tianze was taken aback. "Where to?"

"Returning to Dark Star!" Yang Kai said in a low voice.

"Why leave?" Tianze asked, puzzled. Yang Xiuzhu and the others likewise looked at Yang Kai in surprise, not understanding his words. "Weren't those seniors inviting Elder Qian to go to their place? Why..."

As he spoke, Tianze's brow furrowed as if he had realized something.

Yang Kai could not bring himself to tell the full truth and only said: "Elder Qian will surely not join them; if he refuses, then seeking them out is pointless. Earlier I refused their enticements — though they said nothing at the time, they surely felt some displeasure. If Elder Qian refuses again, who knows whether they might turn hostile."

"They wouldn't go that far, would they?" Tianze broke into a cold sweat.

Though he thought the Void King Realm cultivators unlikely to be so petty, Yang Kai's concern had merit; one must be cautious.

"Just in case, I want to leave Cuiwei Star as soon as Elder Qian wakes," Yang Kai said.

Tianze slightly inclined his head and sighed: "What a pity — I had hoped to invite Sect Master Yang to Lushui City to rest for a few days."

"Another time," Yang Kai chuckled. "Now I have one favor to ask of City Lord Zhao."

"Sect Master Yang, speak freely — I will not fail you," Tianze said solemnly. In the Blood Prison, Yang Kai had set aside grudges and allowed him to return to contemplate by the Domain Stone mountain, and had later saved his life more than once; Tianze naturally wished to repay the debt.

"Could you please go back to Lushui City and bring Qian Yue to me?"

"Miss Qian Yue?"

Tianze was, of course, familiar with Qian Yue. When Yang Kai left Cuiwei Star in the past, Qian Tong and several Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators remained behind, and Qian Yue had stayed as well, intending to probe for the whereabouts of Su Yan and Ice Lord Qing Ya.

Naturally Yang Kai could not forget her as he prepared to leave.

"No problem — I will set out immediately. At most six or seven days, at least two or three; I will bring Miss Qian Yue here!" Tianze promised, then took his leave from Yang Xiuzhu and the others and sped away like the wind.

“Sect Master, why are you so tense?” Yang Xiuzhu looked at Yang Kai in puzzlement. He could feel that Yang Kai was on alert for something — but he had no idea what it was.
