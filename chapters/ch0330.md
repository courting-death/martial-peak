## Chapter 330 — Xiaoyao Sect, Most Xiaoyao, You Understand

In the depths of the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, at a secluded and quiet spot, the disciples of Ghost King Valley sat together, having just experienced a battle, and they needed to recover a little.

In such a perilous place, only by maintaining peak condition at all times could they ensure their safety.

Although they were meditating and resting, none of them dared to relax, remaining vigilant of the surroundings, cautious of any sudden attacks from the red evil spirits.

Yang Kai nodded subtly, curiously glancing at Leng Shan. In the nearly year since they last met, this icy young woman seemed to have grown quite a bit.

While Leng Shan was not the most powerful among this group and not the oldest, the command authority lay in her hands. It was under her arrangement that they could operate so smoothly.

Her high status in Ghost King Valley was one reason, but it was likely also due to the considerable experience she had gained during their previous trials in another location.

The youth Shen Yi sat nearby with a cheerful expression, looking kindly at Yang Kai.

He seemed unaware that Yang Kai had killed two elite disciples of Ghost King Valley and had no knowledge of the entangled relationship between him and Leng Shan.

"What are you doing here?" Yang Kai asked curiously, genuinely surprised to run into someone he knew during this trip to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

While he had a better relationship with Zi Mo during their previous adventures abroad, the imprint of Divine Sense in Leng Shan's mind still maintained a subtle connection between them.

However, this connection was one-sided; Yang Kai could feel Leng Shan, but she could not sense him.

"I can naturally be here," Leng Shan replied, a faint smile appearing on her cold face. "Don't you know where this place is?"

"The Bloodthirsty Evil Cave," Yang Kai furrowed his brow, suddenly realizing, "The territory of Yinming Ghost King... So you guys from Ghost King Valley are in the Cangyun Evil Land."

"Exactly," Leng Shan nodded lightly.

Yang Kai's expression turned astonished. "Ghost King Valley has a connection with the Yinming Ghost King?"

"Though they share the name 'Ghost King', there isn't much of a relation. It's merely within his jurisdiction," Shen Yi interjected with a smile. "Looks like Brother Yang isn't very familiar with the Cangyun Evil Land."

"Indeed," Yang Kai nodded.

Shen Yi laughed heartily, "No worries! If there's anything you don't understand, just ask me. Since you are the lifesaver of my junior sister, you're a friend of Ghost King Valley. If I may ask, where do you hail from?"

"Senior Brother!" Leng Shan gently chided. She knew Yang Kai's background, and reasoned it was significant.

Lingxiao Pavilion had not been famous before, but after the emergence of the evil lord, it gained notoriety throughout the world.

Due to the evil lord's influence, the people of Lingxiao Pavilion were not treated well nowadays, a phenomenon not only observed outside but also within the Cangyun Evil Land!

Since the evil lord appeared, he brought war to Cangyun Evil Land, which not everyone was keen to witness.

Noticing Leng Shan's warning, Shen Yi forced an awkward smile and waved his hand, "Forget I asked, Brother Yang, don't mind me."

Though curious in his heart, he wondered where such a Yang Kai came from that he could not even mention it.

Yang Kai smiled lightly.

"How about you? What brings you here?" Leng Shan asked with curiosity. Lingxiao Pavilion was tens of thousands of miles away, coming here must have been quite a journey.

"I heard there are some interesting things here, so I came to have a look!"

Both Shen Yi and Leng Shan were stunned, exchanging wry smiles.

"You truly have guts to try playing around alone in a place like this..." Leng Shan shook her head helplessly. However, since she knew Yang Kai's strength and peculiarities, she wasn’t too surprised.

Perhaps he truly was qualified to... play around.

"By the way, why are you facing those red evil spirits? I've only encountered green ones on my way here," Yang Kai voiced his curiosity.

"Hahaha." Shen Yi laughed heartily upon realizing that Yang Kai was indeed here for leisure, otherwise he would have fully gathered intelligence on the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave.

Leng Shan could not help but chuckle, lightly pursing her lips.

The others from Ghost King Valley looked at Yang Kai with amused expressions.

Yang Kai scratched his head awkwardly, feeling somewhat embarrassed.

"Alright," Leng Shan said, clearing her throat. This prompted Shen Yi to straighten his expression and ask, "The green evil spirits you encountered are indeed different from the red ones, right?"

"Yes, the red ones are undoubtedly much stronger."

"Exactly. In the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, the deeper you go, the more powerful the evil spirits you encounter. The green evil spirits are only found at the outskirts and are relatively easy to deal with. The red evil spirits are slightly stronger, but not too hard to handle. Deeper in, there are purple evil spirits and black evil spirits, each one more formidable than the last, and their physical bodies become increasingly solid. The black evil spirits already have complete physical forms; even experts at the Divine Roaming Realm would avoid them. We can barely contend with the purple evil spirits, and if we encounter the black ones, better run fast; a careless mistake could cost us our lives here."

Hearing this, Yang Kai's heart stirred. The purple evil spirits might be the origins of Le Yu's Purple Qi Evil Body and Purple Evil Energy.

"So that's how it is!" Yang Kai nodded slightly.

"Moreover, in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, besides these four colors of ordinary evil spirits, Brother Yang, you must also pay attention to a particularly dangerous type of evil spirit," Shen Yi, having changed his perception of Yang Kai, sought to establish a good rapport and spoke extensively.

"Oh?" Yang Kai looked at Shen Yi in surprise, noticing his grave expression and a hint of worry in his eyes, prompting him to inquire, "What kind of evil spirit?"

"The Soul Evil Spirit!" Shen Yi said gravely, with a somewhat warning tone. "This thing looks just like other evil spirits and is extremely difficult to distinguish, but if you do encounter it, I advise you to run!"

"Why?"

"Because it can use soul techniques!" Shen Yi grimaced, "We are only True Yuan Realm martial artists; if we bump into such an evil spirit, we would have no means to deal with it. Do you have any treasures to defend against soul attacks?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

"Then that would be troublesome," Shen Yi furrowed his brow slightly. "Generally, those who venture here carry some treasures to defend against soul attacks. Some may even bring treasures that restrain evil spirit attacks, but since your cultivation method and True Yuan attribute inherently restrain evil spirits, you needn't worry too much."

"No worries, it can't be that unfortunate," Yang Kai chuckled.

Although he didn’t possess a treasure against soul attacks, he did have techniques related to soul defense. The defenses of the Soul Palace should not be lacking.

Thus, he didn't concern himself too much.

"Well, indeed, Soul Evil Spirits are generally encountered very rarely," Shen Yi nodded.

After chatting for a while, the atmosphere lightened considerably.

Just then, a strange sound suddenly echoed from afar. The sound was sharp and piercing, resembling a flute or a wailing ghost.

Upon hearing the sound, the members of Ghost King Valley instinctively turned to look in the direction from which it came.

"Something's moving," Shen Yi's expression sharpened as he spoke in a low voice.

"Yes, let's go take a look," Leng Shan nodded slightly.

Yang Kai did not question further, but from the expressions of the others, it seemed like it wasn't something serious.

"Let’s go," Shen Yi called to the group, glancing at Yang Kai, "Brother Yang, if you don’t mind, why not join us?"

"Sure!" Yang Kai nodded, having inadvertently gathered a mass of evil spirit essence from them earlier. Since he mentioned compensating, he should follow through.

Taking advantage of others is not a good thing.

As they walked ahead, Leng Shan intentionally fell back to walk alongside Yang Kai.

"Rest assured, I won't do anything else to you," Yang Kai said, thinking she might have some worries, and hurriedly reassured her.

"I know you won’t," Leng Shan shook her head. "That's not what I wanted to say."

"Oh, then what is it?"

Leng Shan smiled lightly, "I want to tell you that we didn't come to the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave for training this time."

"If not for training, then what are you here for?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

"We're here to look for someone."

"Look for someone?"

"Yes, several outsiders have killed a number of disciples of Xiaoyao Sect, then fled in here. Ghost King Valley is not far from Xiaoyao Sect, so we were pulled in to help."

Yang Kai casually glanced at her and noticed a hint of resentment on her face as she spoke of Xiaoyao Sect.

He chuckled lightly, "So Xiaoyao Sect often bullies you Ghost King Valley? You guys aren’t here of your own volition, are you?"

"You sure do know a lot!" Leng Shan shot him a glance, further confirming Yang Kai's speculation. She said lightly, "I’ll tell you in advance; after all, you don’t belong to Cangyun Evil Land, and the ones Xiaoyao Sect are hunting are martial artists from outside. If you see any fellow cultivators in danger later, it might be difficult."

"Fellow cultivators?" Yang Kai sneered, "My sect is gone; what fellow cultivators could I have?"

Leng Shan’s expression dimmed. "I've also heard of what happened at Lingxiao Pavilion; you... have my condolences."

Yang Kai snorted lightly.

Perhaps influenced by Shan Qingluo, or because of the upheaval in Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai was indifferent towards notions of righteous or evil, and the trends of the world had no bearing on him, treating people and circumstances based on personal favor.

"So who is Xiaoyao Sect after?" Yang Kai could not help but ask with curiosity.

"Who else could it be but women?" Leng Shan scoffed. "Xiaoyao Sect, most Xiaoyao, every night reveling—You understand."

"Er... I understand," Yang Kai felt a wave of embarrassment, not expecting the cold Leng Shan to express such sentiments.

"And it's said they are a pair of twins, both exceptionally beautiful and quite strong. Their combined skills are quite formidable," Leng Shan’s eyes revealed a hint of delight, "They’ve killed over a dozen disciples of Xiaoyao Sect, doing quite well, but unfortunately, they were eventually forced to flee here."

"You seem to have quite a prejudice against Xiaoyao Sect," Yang Kai remarked with a light laugh as he scrutinized her. "Did someone from Xiaoyao Sect covet your beauty?"

"Hmph!" Leng Shan proudly raised her head and did not respond directly, but her answer was clear enough.

"Hehe..." Yang Kai chuckled, but suddenly his expression turned serious as he asked in a low voice, "If you actually capture those two women, what do you plan to do then?"

"I don't know," Leng Shan shook her head, "I don’t want to get involved with this matter, but my master ordered it, so we can only come to show our faces. We might not even actually catch them. If we do catch them... we'll figure it out then."

"That's true," Yang Kai nodded slightly.
