## Chapter 142 — Su Yan's Fury

In the sky, Yang Kai spotted many familiar faces.

Su Yan, Jie Hongchen, and Lan Chudie were among them, with many others also appearing somewhat familiar.

These individuals were all disciples of the Lingxiao Pavilion.

On the other hand, the people from the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower were keeping their distance, pointing and commenting on the battlefield, with some voices clearly reveling in the misfortune.

Among the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, Su Yan stood out as the most powerful. Wherever that pure, seemingly unattainable white figure passed, snow and wind swept through the air. Yet, even Su Yan could not inflict any effective damage on the tortoise-shaped demon beast. Despite exerting all her strength, she could only use her cold Yuan Qi to slightly slow the beast down, reducing the casualties among the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples.

The beast's defenses were too strong; although it moved slowly, its shell and thick skin served as the finest defensive treasures. The True Yuan Realm warriors could not even break through its defenses.

On the battlefield, numerous corpses lay scattered, all belonging to the Lingxiao Pavilion.

"How could it be that the Lingxiao Pavilion provoked it?" Hu Jiao'er frowned slightly. "Su Yan is not the type to act recklessly."

While in doubt, a young man rushed over, his eyes filled with surprise and unabashed admiration. However, upon noticing Yang Kai standing closely with the two women, his brow furrowed.

"Jiao'er?" The newcomer stopped in front of the two women, unable to discern which was Hu Jiao'er, and could only address one based on instinct.

"Long Jun, what’s going on?" the other person suddenly asked.

So this was Hu Jiao'er.

Long Jun did not feel awkward; instead, he gleefully remarked, "The Lingxiao Pavilion actually took the initiative to provoke it. I don’t know how it happened, but it seems to be relentlessly pursuing these people, leading to the current situation."

"Did Su Yan provoke it?" Hu Jiao'er was extremely surprised.

"It wasn't Su Yan; it was Jie Hongchen!" Long Jun laughed. "That fool led a group of people to try and steal the treasures guarded by the demon beast while it was resting. Unexpectedly, they ended up with nothing and lost several lives in a chaotic escape."

Yang Kai's eyes flickered as he asked, "What did Jie Hongchen obtain?"

If they hadn’t acquired anything, why would the demon beast be pursuing them so relentlessly?

Long Jun looked at Yang Kai with disdain, impatiently replying, "Who are you?"

"Answer his question; I want to know too," Hu Jiao'er shot him a cold glance.

Long Jun quickly adjusted his attitude and said, "I’m not sure, but according to Jie Hongchen, there was nothing there at all. After the demon beast came out, I checked as well, and indeed, there was nothing."

Hu Jiao'er sneered, "It’s impossible for there to be nothing. It must have already been taken by Jie Hongchen and he’s unwilling to reveal it."

Long Jun nodded slightly, "I think so too. But now that Jie Hongchen won’t hand it over, the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples can only face the wrath of this demon beast. Su Yan also doesn’t want too many casualties among the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, which is why she was reluctantly pulled into the battle. This woman’s abilities are far superior to Jie Hongchen’s; if it weren’t for her intervention, those people would have been dead long ago."

"Hmph, relying on a woman to turn danger into safety, Jie Hongchen is only capable of that much," Hu Meier openly expressed her disdain.

"Indeed," Long Jun nodded repeatedly. "I thought the same as Fang Ziqi from Fengyu Tower. We initially wanted to help the Lingxiao Pavilion, but Jie Hongchen is so stubborn that he refuses to admit he took anything. It’s infuriating."

They understood the principle of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold." This tortoise-shaped demon beast was so powerful that even Su Yan had no way to deal with it. Unless the three sects joined forces, they would never be able to subdue it.

But why should they help Jie Hongchen when he wouldn’t even tell them what benefits he had gained from it? Fighting a demon beast without clarity was not something the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower would foolishly engage in.

They could help, but at the very least, Jie Hongchen needed to tell them what he had obtained! What could he offer them in return?

The reason the people from the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower lingered nearby was precisely to wait for the Lingxiao Pavilion to falter before discussing terms.

Yang Kai's gaze remained fixed on the pure white figure in mid-air. Su Yan's expression was not good, likely due to immense exhaustion. However, the survival of hundreds of Lingxiao Pavilion disciples depended solely on her; how could she retreat?

If she retreated, dozens of Lingxiao Pavilion disciples would surely die.

The tortoise-shaped demon beast moved slowly, all thanks to her efforts.

Standing in mid-air, Su Yan danced gracefully. Her enchanting figure resembled a fluttering butterfly, and with a flick of her fingers, several small ice flowers shot forth, landing on the tortoise-shaped demon beast.

Crack, crack, crack… In an instant, those ice flowers grew larger, each several zhang in size, emanating a chilling aura. The massive body of the tortoise-shaped demon beast was suddenly covered by a layer of ice, and with this hindrance, the beast's speed decreased further.

Countless attacks landed on it, but they only sparked off its thick shell, having no effect whatsoever.

Yet, Su Yan's complexion had turned somewhat pale.

"Jie Hongchen, I will ask you one last time, what exactly did you take from it?" Su Yan's beautiful eyes fixed on the tortoise-shaped demon beast below, her voice cold and unyielding as she questioned Jie Hongchen, who stood nearby.

Her icy words, devoid of any emotion, made Jie Hongchen tremble involuntarily.

He sensed the hidden fury in Su Yan's voice!

Su Yan rarely lost her temper, but this time was different. Watching many Lingxiao Pavilion disciples die unjustly because of this matter, how could she remain indifferent as the Master Sister?

Jie Hongchen hesitated, struggled, fear and panic flashing across his face, but soon he steeled himself and replied, "Su Yan, do you still doubt me? If I truly took anything, would I not tell you?"

Upon hearing this, a flash of hatred and disgust crossed Su Yan's eyes. Her cold reprimand echoed in every Lingxiao Pavilion disciple's ears: "All Lingxiao Pavilion disciples, retreat immediately!"

They could not defeat this tortoise-shaped demon beast; their only option was to flee! Although it was uncertain whether it would pursue them, it was still a path to survival.

As Su Yan's voice rang out, many Lingxiao Pavilion disciples wasted no time in executing their techniques, swiftly fleeing from the tortoise-shaped demon beast.

The number of attackers in the sky rapidly decreased, one by one quietly retreating, but still, many were launching their attacks.

Su Yan's expression grew extremely grave as she shouted, "Why aren’t you leaving yet?!"

As soon as her words fell, the layer of ice encasing the tortoise-shaped demon beast exploded. The slow-moving beast broke free from its restraints in that instant, its speed suddenly increasing.

The massive meteor hammer-like tail swept through the air. Those Lingxiao Pavilion disciples who lingered in battle fell like dumplings.

A few unfortunate souls were directly struck by the tail, instantly turning into a puddle of crimson flesh.

More were caught up in the gust of wind generated by the tail, crashing down in a disheveled manner.

The tortoise-shaped demon beast let out a furious roar, as if empowered by the heavens, charging toward Su Yan with blood-red eyes.

This woman had repeatedly sealed it with ice; it loathed her to the core and naturally wanted to eliminate her first.

Su Yan's hands moved rapidly. Accompanied by the changes in her gestures, an overwhelming chill descended from the sky, blanketing the world in white, with frost rising from the ground.

All eyes were on Su Yan. In that moment, her pale face bore a hint of enchanting crimson, resembling a true celestial being, standing apart from the mortal realm, elevated above the heavens. All could only gaze at her with reverence, forever unable to reach her.

The tortoise-shaped demon beast was charging and roaring, swiftly closing the distance between itself and Su Yan. The size difference between them was like that of a watermelon to a sesame seed, yet the latter showed no signs of panic or hesitation, only calmness.

The chilling aura that seemed capable of freezing the entire world converged fiercely toward Su Yan.

Suddenly, a massive white figure appeared behind Su Yan.

It was a magnified version of Su Yan!

Dressed in a pure white gown, her exquisite figure and breathtaking beauty were magnified countless times, yet still flawless, stunningly beautiful.

This gigantic figure kept its eyes closed. But in the next moment, her eyes opened, revealing a towering snow-capped mountain, a sky full of snow, and a vast expanse of white.

A chilling aura descended once more, even more intense than before. Every person gazing at this figure involuntarily felt a sense of being frozen, shivering uncontrollably.

With Su Yan's final gesture, the gigantic figure charged unhesitatingly toward the tortoise-shaped demon beast.

The distance between them was merely a few zhang, and in the blink of an eye, this white figure penetrated the tortoise-shaped demon beast's body.

At a visible speed, a layer of ice reappeared on the demon beast, thicker than before, completely encasing it, freezing its moving limbs in place.

With a gasp, Su Yan coughed up blood; this last move had drained her immensely. Her slender body swayed in mid-air, ultimately unable to hold on, and she fell.

Simultaneously, the frozen tortoise-shaped demon beast still maintained its momentum, charging toward Su Yan.

Its size was too great; even when frozen while running, it could not stop immediately.

As Su Yan fell, her expression remained calm, her eyes reflecting the approaching body of the tortoise-shaped demon beast.

In her eyes, there was regret, sorrow, and attachment, but no hatred.

A chorus of gasps erupted.

At that moment, everyone snapped back to reality from their earlier shock. Yet now, the person regarded as a goddess by all was on the verge of demise.

Amid the gasps, a figure that was not particularly strong was rapidly approaching Su Yan, faint flames flickering beneath his feet, trailing a faint red glow as he ran.

Suddenly, this figure was enveloped in red light, transforming into a blazing fireball. His already swift speed surged to another level.

He dashed to the spot where Su Yan was about to fall, pushing off the ground with force, launching himself upward like an arrow, reaching out to catch Su Yan, then bending his body to shield her with his back against the impact of the tortoise-shaped demon beast.
