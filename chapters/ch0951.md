## Chapter 951 — Wu Fa and Wu Tian

Nine Heavens Sacred Land — the Reception Hall.

The Twin Pavilion's two pavilion masters, Wu Fa and Wu Tian, sat upright in their chairs, faces taut with anxiety, like ants on a hot pan; now and then they turned to peer outside, their eyes betraying a flicker of expectation.

They had been here for several days but still had not seen the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, nor had they encountered the twin sisters who cultivated the Consonant Spirit Technique.

Their hearts were like ants on a hot pan, unbearably restless.

Elder Xu Hui accompanied them at the side; they dared not show too much impatience and could only fret inwardly.

Several years earlier, an unremarkable young disciple from Dragon-Phoenix Palace entered Dragon Valley and awakened the Dragon Emperor's legacy, causing the Dragon Emperor's might to reemerge.

In just two short years that young disciple’s cultivation leapt from the True Yuan Realm, Seventh Stage, to the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage. When he emerged from seclusion he laid waste to all before him; the Youhan Grotto-Heaven that had come to invade Dragon-Phoenix Palace returned defeated, suffering grievous losses while Dragon-Phoenix Palace scored a sweeping victory.

When the news reached the Twin Pavilion, Wu Fa and Wu Tian were green with envy and came to fully appreciate the majesty of an ancient legacy.

While happy for Dragon-Phoenix Palace, they couldn't help feeling a touch of despondency.

The supreme inheritances of both the Twin Pavilion and Dragon-Phoenix Palace had broken off at the same time, yet now Dragon-Phoenix Palace had found fresh hope while the Twin Pavilion still had none.

After comparing the two, how could Wu Fa and Wu Tian possibly remain balanced in heart?

They often sighed, lamenting that heaven had not favored the Twin Pavilion.

But a few years later Elder Xiao Ling of Dragon-Phoenix Palace arrived beaming with joy to report that in a Small Xuan Realm two twin sisters cultivating the Consonant Spirit Technique had appeared.

And the pair had recently arrived on Tongxuan Continent — right here in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land!

Upon hearing this, Wu Fa and Wu Tian set out at once from the Twin Pavilion and hurried here without pause, not daring to tarry even a moment, finally arriving at the Nine Heavens Sacred Land as fast as possible.

Yet they could not find the pair; questioning Xu Hui yielded no clear answers, and the brothers' emotions shifted between hope and despair.

Fortunately, just now Xu Hui rushed over to tell them the Saint Lord would arrive imminently and to ask them to remain calm.

"Elder," Wu Fa could no longer contain his impatience and blurted out, "may I ask when Saint Lord Yang will be here?" The moment the words left his mouth his face flushed with embarrassment.

In the short time since they arrived he had already asked the very same question three or four times.

Xu Hui smiled faintly and inclined his head. "The Saint Lord said he will arrive at any moment. Brother Wu, are you perhaps a little too anxious?"

Wu Fa forced an awkward laugh. "A little, Elder — please forgive me!"

"Big brother!" At that moment Wu Tian suddenly stiffened and called out in a low shout.

Wu Fa immediately released his Divine Sense and indeed detected someone rapidly approaching outside. The brothers could no longer remain seated; swaying to their feet, they came out to the reception hall's entrance and looked forward toward the distance.

After a moment, a flash of azure light streaked past and three figures appeared with composed ease.

Leading them was a broad-shouldered youth, his aura formidable, eyes bright with spirit — plainly someone of strength.

Yet Wu Fa and Wu Tian's gaze was irresistibly drawn to the two women walking behind him.

The two women were identical in appearance; their life auras and True Yuan fluctuations matched perfectly. Standing together there seemed to be an invisible bond between them — True Yuan coexisting, life force intertwined.

Were it not for subtle differences in temperament, anyone would surely mistake them for the same person.

Wu Fa and Wu Tian inhaled sharply, their expressions suddenly surging with excitement; they stared unblinkingly at the Hu sisters, eyes filling with joy and exhilaration.

No confirmation was needed — the instant they saw the two, Wu Fa and Wu Tian were certain the sisters cultivated the Consonant Spirit Technique.

Across the world, only the Consonant Spirit Technique could cause practitioners to exhibit such a phenomenon; no other method could achieve it.

Moreover, the sisters practiced the most orthodox form of the Consonant Spirit Technique.

In terms of matching aura and life trace, even pavilion masters like Wu Fa and Wu Tian were eclipsed by the Hu sisters; the degree of True Yuan coexistence between the two women surpassed theirs.

"Big brother!" Wu Tian said with a low, fierce cry, a trace of fanatic fervor appearing on his face.

"No doubt about it," Wu Fa replied, equally thrilled. "This is absolutely the Twin Pavilion's lost supreme inheritance!"

The Hu sisters also studied Wu Fa and Wu Tian curiously; they had never seen warriors with a condition like theirs.

But the two men's ravenous stares gave the sisters a momentary chill, and they instinctively drew back behind Yang Kai.

Noticing the sisters' subtle recoil, Wu Fa and Wu Tian hastily softened their expressions into ingratiating smiles, projecting harmless affability.

"Are you the pavilion masters of the Twin Pavilion?" Yang Kai asked pleasantly.

Wu Fa and Wu Tian's faces turned serious and they clasped their fists in salute in unison. "Indeed. Are you Saint Lord Yang?"

Yang Kai nodded.

"I've long heard of your great name!" Wu Fa exchanged pleasantries and, wasting no time, went straight to the point. "Saint Lord Yang, these two young ladies..."

Yang Kai smiled and cut him off. "Let's speak inside first."

Saying that, he led the Hu sisters into the main hall.

Wu Fa and Wu Tian exchanged a glance and, with no choice, followed along.

Once host and guests were seated and tea was served, Yang Kai spoke calmly, "I'll be frank: I understand why you two pavilion masters have come."

Wu Fa's face flushed with eager anticipation as he looked at Yang Kai, waiting for him to continue.

"However, my Sacred Land has no prior dealings with the Twin Pavilion, and I am not particularly familiar with you two," Yang Kai said, "so some matters must be made clear first. I hope you will understand."

"Saint Lord Yang is right — that's only proper," Wu Fa and Wu Tian quickly agreed.

"Put it this way: you hope these two will go to your Twin Pavilion, correct?"

Wu Fa and Wu Tian nodded together.

"Because they possess the twin supreme inheritance and are the Twin Pavilion's hope for revival. They've also expressed a desire to visit the Twin Pavilion — I've already confirmed that with them."

"Truly?" Wu Fa nearly leapt for joy, gazing gratefully at the Hu sisters.

They'd been worried the sisters might not wish to go; if the sisters themselves had no intention of leaving, they could not force them.

This is the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, a place teeming with masters. The brothers themselves only had First Stage of the Saint Realm cultivation; though together they could likely defeat a Second Stage Saint, such strength was paltry here.

During their few days here they had sensed one terrifying aura after another from a nearby peak. There was no doubt top experts at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm held court here.

To act rashly here would be to dig one's own grave.

“This is a matter of mutual consent, and as an outsider it isn’t really my place to say much.” Yang Kai smiled gently. “But to me, these two young ladies are… well, like the little sisters next door.”

At that remark the Hu sisters glanced at him slowly.

Yang Kai pretended not to notice and continued, "They only arrived on Tongxuan Continent recently; before that they lived in a Small Xuan Realm and know nothing of this place. I must ask questions on their behalf."

"Please ask, Saint Lord Yang; my brother and I will provide satisfactory answers," Wu Fa replied earnestly.

"If they go to the Twin Pavilion, what treatment will they receive?" Yang Kai dropped politeness and asked directly.

Wu Fa thought a moment. "Dragon-Phoenix Palace has a disciple named Sun Yu who inherited the Dragon Emperor. Whatever Dragon-Phoenix Palace did for Sun Yu, the Twin Pavilion will do for these two."

Yang Kai nodded in approval. "And if they ever wish to return here..."

"We will never stand in their way. Let the Twin Pavilion's inheritance flourish wherever it may."

"While they're with you, in terms of cultivation..."

"We will provide them with the finest resources our sect can offer and the best environment for cultivation. My brother and I will protect them at all times; no harm will come to them unless we die."

"As for the Consonant Spirit Technique they possess..."

"If they do not wish to disclose it, no one will coerce them. That is a fate bestowed upon them by their forebears and the Twin Pavilion would never force them."

"They..."

......

Yang Kai addressed each point one by one, and Wu Fa and Wu Tian answered in turn as if rehearsed, earnest and unconditional in their promises — every reply exceeding all expectations.

"They..."

"Yang Kai!" Hu Jiao'er quietly nudged Yang Kai and signaled with her eyes, "That's enough — don't put them through too much."

Yang Kai's questions and demands were practical and probing; the Hu sisters had no wish to see Wu Fa and Wu Tian make any further vows.

They had already sensed the other's sincerity.

"Then it's settled," Yang Kai chuckled, turning to give an order. "Xu Hui, prepare some Saint Pills for them to take on the road."

"Yes!" Xu Hui hurried out to make the arrangements.

In recent days Xia Ningshang and five masters had continued refining the pills needed by seekers, so the Sacred Land had accumulated a number of Saint Pills and Spirit-Grade Pills.

Wu Fa and Wu Tian both flinched slightly, surprised as they looked at Yang Kai.

Saint Pills were rare indeed; for Saint Lord Yang to offer some to the two girls showed how highly he regarded them.

For a moment, their expressions became ambiguous with meaning.

"When do you wish to depart?" Yang Kai turned to the Hu sisters.

Hu Jiao'er pondered, then said, "As the seniors prefer."

Wu Fa, eager beyond restraint, said, "Let's leave right now — the road is long; it will take at least a month or two to reach the Twin Pavilion."

"Very well." Hu Jiao'er nodded and looked to Yang Kai. "Please give my father a greeting — we'll go to the Twin Pavilion to have a look and will return after some time; tell him not to worry."

"Consider it done," Yang Kai replied.

"How should we address the two young ladies?" Wu Fa and Wu Tian had come forward to ask the Hu sisters' names; they would be staying at the Twin Pavilion for a long time, so names must be known.

The Hu sisters promptly answered.

The four conversed happily and the mood was warm; the Twin Pavilion's two pavilion masters appeared deeply gratified, looking upon the Hu sisters with unparalleled kindness.
