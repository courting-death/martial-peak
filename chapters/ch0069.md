## Chapter 69 — The Difference Between Disciple and Ancestor

“Currently, within Lingxiao Pavilion, the Grand Elder has allied with the Fourth and Fifth Elders, with the Grand Elder as their leader. Meanwhile, the Second and Third Elders form another faction. The former seeks to usurp the Sect Leader’s position, while the latter aims to uphold it. However, the Grand Elder’s faction wields greater strength, and over these years of open and covert struggles, the Second and Third Elders have suffered many setbacks.”

Hearing Li Yuntian’s words, Yang Kai’s mind suddenly cleared.

When the elders are at odds, the younger generation naturally quarrels as well. The grudge between Su Mu and Wei Zhuang likely stems from this very conflict.

Zhao Hu sneered, “It’s nothing but the tiger staying in the mountains while the monkey claims the throne. If the Sect Leader were to reappear, what would the Grand Elder and his faction amount to?”

Li Yuntian shot Zhao Hu a sharp glance. “Do not speak ill behind their backs. We younger disciples must not criticize our elders, even if we disapprove of their actions.”

Zhao Hu stuck out his tongue lightly. “You think the same, don’t you?”

Li Yuntian replied, “But I won’t say it.”

At the Contribution Hall, Xia Ningshang hurriedly rushed in. Old Shopkeeper Meng smiled warmly at her. “Disciple, you’ve come to visit your master again today? Such filial piety brings me great comfort.”

Xia Ningshang said urgently, “Master, something grave has happened.”

“What is it?” Meng Wuya looked puzzled. He had never seen his disciple so flustered before.

Xia Ningshang quickly recounted the recent conflict between Yang Kai and Wei Zhuang.

After hearing the story, Meng Wuya’s face darkened. “You say that Yang Kai has already reached the third stage of the Open Origin Realm? And he even defeated Wei Zhuang?”

“Yes!” Xia Ningshang nodded repeatedly, thinking to herself that she had helped him break through.

“Looks like the fortune he gained in Black Wind Mountain was no small matter. When he strikes, it is with thunderous force. His cultivation speed is astonishing,” Meng Wuya said with some surprise.

“Master, please stop marveling and think of a way to save him,” Xia Ningshang urged anxiously.

Meng Wuya was momentarily stunned, staring at his disciple with a strange expression. “Disciple, why are you so nervous?”

Xia Ningshang hesitated, then murmured, “Am I?”

“Yes, you are very tense right now,” Meng Wuya nodded knowingly. He knew his disciple’s pure and simple nature better than anyone. Over the years, many outstanding male disciples in Lingxiao Pavilion had admired her, but she always treated them with polite distance. Yet today, she sought help for someone only at the third stage of Open Origin Realm. This was unusual.

Xia Ningshang said, “I just don’t want his path of cultivation, which has only just begun to show promise, to be cut short.”

“Are you close to him?” Meng Wuya’s tone turned cautious.

“No, but I’ve observed him for two years. You know I work in the Shadow Hall, responsible for the area where he lives,” Xia Ningshang spoke honestly, then pleaded, “Master, please find a way to save him. This time he offended the Grand Elder. Without help from a powerful figure, he’s doomed. The Second Elder may not care about his fate. Master, you are that powerful figure!”

Meng Wuya’s face lit up with pleasure. Flattery always worked, especially when it came from his precious disciple.

After basking in the moment, Meng Wuya frowned. “Disciple, this matter is difficult for your master to intervene in. After all, this is a family affair of Lingxiao Pavilion. I am but a caretaker. How could I interfere?”

This was true. Although he had a good impression of Yang Kai, as an outsider, it was improper to meddle in the Pavilion’s internal affairs.

Xia Ningshang said nothing, only fixed Meng Wuya with a pair of watery eyes. Though a veil obscured her face, Meng Wuya could still see her pout.

Unable to resist such a gaze, Meng Wuya grimaced. “Ah, my little lady, don’t be so willful. Even if I don’t act, the Second Elder will surely make arrangements. Yang Kai was only dragged into this because of Su Mu. If the Second Elder ignores him, how could he win hearts in the future?”

“What if he doesn’t?” Xia Ningshang asked angrily.

“That’s unlikely,” Meng Wuya admitted uncertainly. After all, in high-level struggles, sacrificing one or two insignificant disciples was common.

“Hmph!” Xia Ningshang turned away and sat on a nearby chair, sulking. “If you don’t help him, then I won’t be able to go to the Nine Yin Convergence Place either. Your disciple’s strength will likely remain stuck here forever!”

Meng Wuya was shocked by her words. He hurried out from behind the counter, stooping before Xia Ningshang like a servant, lowering his posture. “Where did you get such an idea?”

Xia Ningshang turned her head away, silent.

Meng Wuya quickly changed tactics and stepped before her again. “Tell me, why can’t you go there if I don’t help him?”

“Since you don’t care about his life or death, don’t care about mine either. Master, you are such a cold and heartless man!”

Her words struck Meng Wuya like an arrow, piercing his heart and stunning him as if struck by lightning. His fragile heart shattered into countless pieces.

“My lady, my lady! Can’t we talk this through? This old bone of mine can’t take such torment,” Meng Wuya kowtowed repeatedly, utterly humble.

This was no mere attitude toward a disciple—it was the reverence one shows to an ancestor.

Only then did Xia Ningshang turn back and softly say, “His cultivation technique is Yang attribute martial art, and the Yang Primordial Qi in his body is extraordinarily pure!”

“Yang attribute Primordial Qi?” Meng Wuya’s expression grew grave. “How pure?”

“More than five times purer than the person you brought last time!” Xia Ningshang replied.

“Have you tested it yourself?” Meng Wuya asked eagerly.

“Yes.”

“If that’s the case, he truly cannot be allowed to perish!” Meng Wuya straightened his back suddenly. After a moment’s thought, he strode toward the door.

At the threshold, he paused and looked back at Xia Ningshang. “Disciple, do you reject him?”

“No,” Xia Ningshang shook her head slowly.

“So you like him?”

“Not like, just not dislike.” Xia Ningshang’s face flushed with embarrassment at the question.

“Very well. You know what you must do to go there, but you must promise me you will not be moved by him. Only then will I save him.”

“Master, what are you saying!” Xia Ningshang fidgeted. “I haven’t even spoken to him.”

Her words betrayed a guilty conscience as she involuntarily recalled the awkwardness of that night.

“I do not intend to sever your feelings, but… such a small place is no place for you. There is no one here worthy of your heart. One day, you will reach heights no one else can attain. You will live for hundreds, even thousands of years, while those you love will age and perish before you. I do not want you to endure such pain. Remember, the pinnacle of martial cultivation is loneliness, solitude, and the coldness of great heights.”
