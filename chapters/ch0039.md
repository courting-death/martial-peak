## Chapter 39 — Battle!

Su Mu glared at Cheng Shaofeng with venomous eyes, not even blinking once, his voice cold and sharp: “Cheng Shaofeng, if you don’t kill the Young Master today, the Young Master will never let you off!”

“You’re still so arrogant!” Cheng Shaofeng’s fleeting hesitation vanished instantly, replaced by wild fury. The stone in his hand was slammed down with brutal force. If it landed true, Su Mu would be grievously wounded, if not dead.

“Young Master Su!” Li Yuntian and the others crouched on the ground, clutching their heads as the disciples of Fengyu Tower rained punches and kicks upon them, crying out in despair.

Hu Mei’er’s eyes flickered with shock, her heart pounding fiercely. This was merely a scuffle among junior disciples, yet she had never imagined it would escalate to such a degree. If Su Mu truly died here, then with his status, Lingxiao Pavilion and Fengyu Tower would surely be at war.

Each person’s thoughts diverged, but all eyes were fixed on the stone in Cheng Shaofeng’s hand.

Just as the stone was about to strike Su Mu’s head, a somewhat thin hand suddenly shot out to block it. The hand did not look particularly strong, even somewhat frail. The sharp edge of the stone tore through the palm, and blood splattered immediately.

The stone fell, but because of the barrier of that palm, Su Mu escaped unharmed.

The fatal blow was stopped. Li Yuntian and the others, their hearts held tight, finally exhaled in relief. They looked closely to see who had saved Su Mu at this critical moment, but upon seeing the face of the newcomer, their expressions turned awkward.

“Senior Brother Yang?” Li Yuntian muttered. He never expected the savior to be Yang Kai—the very Yang Kai they had planned to deal with today. For a moment, Li Yuntian was utterly ashamed.

The scene suddenly fell silent. Those who had been attacking ceased their blows, while those beaten took the chance to catch their breath.

Hu Mei’er stood to the side, her mouth slightly open, staring at Yang Kai in shock. She noticed that despite the blood flowing freely from his palm, his brow did not furrow, nor did any pain show on his face. Instead, there was a hint of excitement and eagerness. His bright, sharp eyes gleamed with a fierce light.

For some reason, Hu Mei’er suddenly felt this youth was dangerous.

Drip… drip…

Crimson blood dripped through his fingers, breaking the silence.

Cheng Shaofeng’s face darkened as he stared at Yang Kai, coldly asking, “You are a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded. The familiar sting thrilled him, his blood boiling with anticipation, eager to unleash a fierce battle to vent the restlessness within.

“Interfering in others’ affairs?” Cheng Shaofeng’s tone grew hostile. Hearing this, the other Fengyu Tower disciples quickly abandoned Li Yuntian and the rest, gradually encircling Yang Kai.

“Others’ affairs?” Yang Kai grinned. “You already said I’m a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. How can this be others’ affairs? After all, they still call me Senior Brother.”

“Good, another one coming right to me.” Cheng Shaofeng laughed loudly. “I really can’t stand you Lingxiao Pavilion disciples! Today, I’ll deal with as many as come!”

“Senior Brother Yang, run!” Li Yuntian shouted loudly from the ground. “They outnumber you; you’re no match. Hurry…”

Li Yuntian was unlucky. Crawling nearby was a Fengyu Tower disciple who found his incessant shouting annoying. This disciple quickly stepped forward and struck Li Yuntian’s neck with a palm, silencing him instantly.

Meanwhile, Cheng Shaofeng and Yang Kai exchanged harsh words, their quarrel accompanied by a fierce struggle over the stone. Cheng Shaofeng tried to wrest it away with force, but the stone seemed to have grown legs, firmly held in Yang Kai’s grasp.

Cheng Shaofeng was already at the Open Origin Realm. Seeing this thin, frail youth—like a gust of wind could topple him—only a Body Tempering Realm disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion causing him such trouble enraged him deeply.

He immediately released the stone and shouted, “Attack!”

The Fengyu Tower disciples surrounding them heard the order and surged toward Yang Kai. Yang Kai quickly rose, gripping the blood-stained stone, and smashed it directly onto the head of a Fengyu Tower disciple.

The power of fists and feet could never compare to a weapon in hand. Though just a stone, it could deliver a force far greater than bare hands. A disciple charging forward was struck fiercely on the head by the stone, skin split and flesh torn. He clutched his head and collapsed to the ground.

Knocking down this one did not slow Yang Kai. His movements grew even more fierce and relentless, hurling the stone at others from all directions like a hawk swooping on prey.

Yang Kai’s ferocity and ruthlessness far exceeded everyone’s expectations.

He toppled four Fengyu Tower disciples in succession. The stone in his hand shattered with a punch, sending shards flying like a burst of hidden weapons, scattering in all directions.

The Fengyu Tower disciples cried out in pain, clutching their faces. Many were cut by the flying shards, wailing in agony.

Seizing the opportunity, Yang Kai kicked out twice, sending two Fengyu Tower disciples flying. Yet, he was immediately overwhelmed by the enemy.

The number of Fengyu Tower disciples was considerable. Though Yang Kai had felled several, he was still outnumbered four to two.

The clash of blows rang out. Yang Kai staggered; several Fengyu Tower disciples fell. Those who hit the ground were all burning hot, their faces flushed red. Yang Kai’s True Yang Technique finally revealed its power. His fists and kicks infused with True Yang Yuan Qi were not something these Body Tempering Realm disciples at stages six or seven could withstand.

He had yet to unleash the power of Yang Liquid. If he did, his strength would likely increase further. But having only refined one drop after many days of cultivation, Yang Kai was reluctant to use it.

Many Fengyu Tower disciples had fallen to Yang Kai, but he himself was not unscathed. At Body Tempering Realm stage seven, lacking any body movement martial skills, he could not evade the enemy’s encirclement.

Blood streamed down Yang Kai’s forehead, arms, and thighs, marking countless wounds. Yet these pains did not diminish his fighting spirit. Instead, they spurred him on, making his strikes fiercer.

A warm sensation spread through his bones. Yang Kai seemed to possess endless strength. As this warmth radiated, his power increased, and even his speed quickened.

Yang Kai did not understand the profound mysteries hidden within the Proud Bone Golden Body, but every injury and every pain activated its power. Wounds and suffering only made him stronger.

Hu Mei’er, watching from the sidelines, eyes sparkling with interest, kept her cherry lips parted. She had thought this Lingxiao Pavilion disciple would quickly be defeated and beaten by Cheng Shaofeng and the others. But the battle’s development exceeded her expectations. Nearly ten Fengyu Tower disciples had fallen. Aside from those knocked unconscious by the stone at the start, the rest writhed on the ground, emitting waves of heat, their skin flushed crimson.

This youth was using Yuan Qi in battle? Hu Mei’er was astonished. At the Body Tempering Realm, using Yuan Qi was a double-edged sword. Every bit used was lost and difficult to recover. It was courting death. Was he not afraid this would affect his future cultivation?
