## Chapter 2121 — Qingyang Mountain Range

Qin Chaoyang finally woke up after a full two hours.

He stared blankly for a moment, then suddenly remembered what had happened before he fainted. His face changed dramatically as he looked around, but when he saw that Yang Kai was safe and sound, he finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Naturally, he was very curious about what that red-clothed woman wanted and what had happened while he was unconscious.

Yang Kai didn’t tell the truth. Since the matter involved Mo Xiaoqi’s background and identity, he made up a casual story—claiming the red-clothed woman had mistaken him for someone else.

Qin Chaoyang was half-convinced, but since both of them were unharmed, he didn’t press for details. Instead, they continued toward Qingyang Shrine.

Yang Kai’s tower-ship had been destroyed, and the red-clothed woman had compensated him with a small wooden boat before leaving. Yang Kai hadn’t had time to refine it, so Qin Chaoyang had to summon his own flying Secret Treasure.

It was a Secret Treasure shaped like a carriage, Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level. The space inside was not as large as Yang Kai’s tower-ship, but its speed was nearly the same.

Yang Kai took the opportunity to refine the wooden boat Secret Treasure.

The red-clothed woman was, after all, a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert. The Secret Treasure she casually gave Yang Kai was Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level! It was filled with many formations. Though it had no offensive power, its defense was as solid as iron, which greatly satisfied Yang Kai.

He was about to enter the Four Seasons Land, and he would definitely need a flying Secret Treasure then, so he hurried to refine it.

Nothing else happened along the way. After more than ten days, the two entered the territory controlled by Qingyang Shrine.

Qingyang Shrine was a famous sect in the Southern Territory, standing alongside Wuhua Hall and Tianwu Sacred Land. Only Star God Palace ranked above them.

Its main headquarters was located in a long mountain range, with tens of thousands of disciples and countless experts!

Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang didn’t know why that master had designated Qin Chaoyang to go to Qingyang Shrine to exchange for an entry spot into the Four Seasons Land, but since he said so, it likely had something to do with the shrine.

As soon as the two stepped into the Qingyang Mountain Range, they were shocked by the Spiritual Qi hidden within the mountains.

The rich Spiritual Qi rushed toward them, carrying the fragrance of flowers and grass, refreshing their minds. Cultivating in such a favorable environment would surely yield extraordinary results.

Yang Kai guessed that there must be many high-quality Earth Veins beneath the Qingyang Mountain Range. There might even be supreme Earth Veins; otherwise, there wouldn’t be such dense Spiritual Qi.

And this was just the outer area. If they went deeper into the center, what kind of scene would that be?

He looked around, secretly amazed at the foundation Qingyang Shrine possessed. Unexpectedly, he found Qin Chaoyang looking a bit tense and uneasy.

After thinking for a moment, he understood.

After all, this was the headquarters of a top sect in the Southern Territory. Qin Chaoyang, the head of a small family in Fenglin City, might be a big shot there, but here, he might not even be on par with an ordinary disciple. Naturally, he felt a lot of pressure, afraid he might say something wrong or be disrespectful when meeting people.

He was here to ask for a favor, after all. Of course he was nervous.

In contrast, Yang Kai seemed completely at ease, as if he were sightseeing, taking in all the beautiful scenery along the way.

Suddenly, Yang Kai stopped and said, “Brother Qin, someone’s coming.”

“Ah…” Qin Chaoyang seemed to be lost in thought. Startled by Yang Kai’s words, he quickly stopped and stood quietly in place.

Soon, two streaks of light shot over from the distance, landing precisely not far in front of them. The newcomers eyed them coldly.

One was fat, with big head and ears, his face so chubby it was hard to see his eyes. The other was a blue-faced man; it was unclear if his skin was naturally that color or if it was due to some secret technique, but he didn’t look like a normal person.

Neither of them had high cultivation—one was Second Stage of the Void King Realm, the other Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

But as patrol disciples, such cultivation was enough to show the deep foundation of Qingyang Shrine!

“Who are you, and why have you trespassed into Qingyang Shrine?” The fat man showed no fear despite the difference in cultivation. Instead, he acted high and mighty, bossing Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang around.

Yang Kai’s heart stirred. He thought, a great sect really is different. Elsewhere, if a Dao Origin Realm stood before Void King Realm cultivators, they would be trembling, but here, these two didn’t show a hint of fear. Instead, it was as if his cultivation was lower than theirs.

Qin Chaoyang was also surprised, but remembering this was Qingyang Shrine, he quickly understood. He lowered his posture, cupped his fists, and said, “Greetings, Young Brothers. I am the head of the Qin Family in Fenglin City… This is…”

Before he could introduce Yang Kai, the fat man frowned and said, “Fenglin City? Never heard of it.”

“Never heard of it!” The blue-faced man also looked impatient and said disdainfully, “Probably some backwater place.”

“Senior Brother is right!” The fat man stroked his double chin in agreement, then turned to Qin Chaoyang and shouted, “Bumpkin, why aren’t you staying in Fengye City? What are you doing at Qingyang Shrine?”

“B-bumpkin…” Qin Chaoyang was stunned. No one had ever called him that to his face before.

A surge of anger welled up inside him, but since he was under someone else’s roof, he had to swallow his pride, suppress his anger, and force a smile. “It’s Fenglin City, not Fengye City!”

“Isn’t it the same?” said the fat man.

“Yeah, same thing!” the blue-faced man nodded.

“You still haven’t answered my question. Why have you come to Qingyang Shrine? If you don’t answer quickly, we’ll treat you as invaders. Don’t blame my Senior Brother for being ruthless!” The fat man, with surprising agility for his size, took up an attacking stance.

“We Senior Brother and Junior Brother are very formidable. State your purpose quickly!” The blue-faced man also struck a pose, clearly ready to fight at the slightest provocation.

“Wait!” Qin Chaoyang was startled. These two Void King Realm cultivators dared to show killing intent so openly. Though they were overestimating themselves, this was Qingyang Shrine’s headquarters. If a fight broke out, experts would surely arrive, and no matter how capable he and Yang Kai were, they wouldn’t be able to escape.

He carefully chose his words and said, “Don’t be nervous, Young Brothers. Brother Yang and I are not enemies of your shrine.”

“Whether you’re enemies or not, my Senior Brother and I will decide!” the fat man barked.

“Right, it’s not your place to say!” The blue-faced man, though the Senior Brother, seemed to have no opinions of his own. Whatever the fat Junior Brother said, he echoed.

Qin Chaoyang sighed helplessly, “I came here to request an audience with your Hall Master.”

Hearing this, the fat Junior Brother and blue-faced Senior Brother were both stunned, silent for a long while.

After a moment, the fat Junior Brother turned to his Senior Brother and said, “Senior Brother, did I hear wrong? Did this bumpkin just say he wants to see the Hall Master?”

“Senior Brother heard it too,” the blue-faced Senior Brother nodded.

“Outrageous!” The fat Junior Brother suddenly roared, “You bumpkin, give you an inch and you want a mile! How dare you mess with me? Take this!”

In a flash, the fat Junior Brother shook his body, formed seals with his hands, and unleashed a surge of power toward Qin Chaoyang.

The blue-faced Senior Brother reacted quickly, whipping out a long sword Secret Treasure. Sword light flashed as he thrust straight for Yang Kai’s face; his moves were grand and sweeping—frankly, full of openings.

“What are you two doing?” Qin Chaoyang was shocked. He quickly activated his Origin Qi and neutralized the fat Junior Brother’s attack.

He hadn’t expected them to attack right after he stated his purpose.

Fortunately, neither of them was strong. With his Dao Origin Realm cultivation, he had nothing to fear.

On the other side, Yang Kai caught the blue-faced man’s seemingly fierce long sword between his fingers.

Both of them only neutralized the attacks, without retaliating.

“Ah!” The fat Junior Brother cried out in surprise, “Not good, Senior Brother! These two are Dao Origin Realm cultivators—retreat!”

Only now did he realize Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang’s cultivation was higher than theirs.

“Oh!” The blue-faced Senior Brother also came to his senses. Using some unknown movement technique, he abandoned his long sword Secret Treasure and quickly retreated to his Junior Brother’s side.

“They’re powerful enemies! Senior Brother, let’s go—these two aren’t easy to deal with!” The fat Junior Brother looked flustered and immediately fled.

The blue-faced man followed closely behind.

From afar, the fat Junior Brother’s voice rang out, “Just you wait! When our shrine’s experts arrive, you’ll be in trouble!”

“Uh…” Qin Chaoyang was dumbfounded, standing there with a helpless expression.

Yang Kai was also speechless. After thinking for a moment, he took the long sword caught between his fingers and held it in his palm.

“Brother Yang, what should we do…” Qin Chaoyang was flustered, ready to give up.

“Let’s go further in. If I’m right, we should soon meet someone who can actually make decisions.” Yang Kai smiled.

“Is that really okay?” Qin Chaoyang hesitated.

“If we truly run, it’s like mud on pants—whether it is or not, it’ll be taken as filth. If Qingyang Shrine puts us on a wanted list, you and I won’t be able to stand in the Southern Territory. Better to face them and explain ourselves.”

“Brother Yang makes sense… But I’m just afraid they won’t believe us.” Qin Chaoyang said worriedly.

Yang Kai laughed, “Those two we met earlier… their thinking is a bit unusual. I reckon the other people in Qingyang Shrine know that. If we explain properly, they should understand.”

“Let’s hope so.” Qin Chaoyang nodded. Once he understood, his nervousness and fear faded, and he continued forward with Yang Kai.
