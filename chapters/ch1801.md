## Chapter 1801 — You Wait and See

"Where did they go?" In the Starry Sky, Ni Guang, Ghost Ancestor and Xue Yue looked left and right.

A quarter of an hour earlier they had lost sight of Zi Long and his son and of Xu Wei; at that time they had only seen, at the direction where Zi Long and the others had been, a Secret Treasure flash its radiance, and soon after Zi Long and the others had fled far away.

"What did they use? Why did their speed suddenly become so fast!" Xue Yue fretted like an ant on a hot pan; now she could only tail Zi Long to determine the direction where Yang Kai might be, and losing Zi Long's trail in an instant, how was she to find Yang Kai?

Yang Kai was carrying the Everlasting Tree, and that would inevitably invite endless disaster; she could not bear to let Yang Kai act alone. If she and the others hurried over, at the very least they could give him a hand.

"Skybreaking Shuttle!" Ni Guang's eyes flashed with light. "So Purple Star really does have something called a Skybreaking Shuttle — I always thought the rumor was false."

"Skybreaking Shuttle? Is it formidable?" Ghost Ancestor asked.

"That is an artifact handed down by the Great Emperor himself — do you think it's formidable or not?" Ni Guang said slowly as he glanced at him.

"Handed down by the Great Emperor?" Ghost Ancestor's expression changed and he murmured.

"That wouldn't be strictly correct," Ni Guang pondered, then said, "It was the Great Emperor's method of forging that was passed down, and it was Purple Star's artificers who actually forged them."

"You gave me a fright," Ghost Ancestor said, still shaken.

If it were truly a treasure personally passed down by the Great Emperor, then perhaps none in this Star Domain could stand against it; but if it was only the forging method left behind by the Great Emperor, then it was less terrifying.

"Even so, the Skybreaking Shuttle is the fastest Secret Treasure in the entire Star Domain. Now that we've lost their trail, how are we to pursue them?" Ni Guang furrowed his brow — the Star Domain was vast; who knew in which direction Yang Kai and Zi Long had gone?

If they erred by even the smallest sliver in direction, they could be off by a thousand li.

"Heh heh, luckily I left a trick up my sleeve," Ghost Ancestor suddenly seemed to remember something and chuckled softly.

"Oh? You have a way?" Ni Guang looked at Ghost Ancestor in surprise; the disappointment in his eyes was replaced by delight.

"Yes. Wait a moment." Ghost Ancestor said, then flicked his hand and summoned the Ten Thousand Souls Banner. His hands formed seals in rapid succession; one by one mysterious seals appeared, and after a moment his expression turned grave as he pressed the banner with one finger and roared, "Go!"

The Ten Thousand Souls Banner trembled slightly, then suddenly turned into a black gas that flew off toward a direction.

"Follow me!" Ghost Ancestor gestured and set off in the direction the Ten Thousand Souls Banner had flown.

Ni Guang led Xue Yue in pursuit.

Not long after they left, where the Star Domain had earlier been empty a blurred figure appeared, skulking; the whole person was semi-transparent, his aura and life fluctuations suppressed to the utmost — unless examined at close range, one would hardly sense him at all.

This person was none other than Elder Kong Fa of the Spine of the Star River!

He came to the place where Ghost Ancestor and the others had stopped and, looking toward the direction they had gone, a battle raged in his heart.

Follow. Or not follow?

If he followed, with his First Stage of the Void King Realm cultivation he would likely face endless peril.

But if he did not follow, knowing the Everlasting Tree lay ahead, he could not bring himself to give it up.

After only a moment's consideration, Kong Fa grit his teeth and quietly tailed Ghost Ancestor and the others.

Before the temptation of the Everlasting Tree he was utterly helpless! He hoped his luck would hold — that when those powerful ones fought to mutual ruin he might fish in troubled waters.

The Martial Dao was boundless, and the Star Domain endless.

This chase across the boundless Star Domain, involving several parties, lasted a full five months.

Yang Kai had ridden at the head the whole time, teasing the three pursuing Zi Long with a calm, carefree air; his condition had long since fully recovered. Breaking away from Zi Long and the others would have been effortless.

But he did not do that.

He intended to give Zi Long and the others a grand surprise, so he kept a leisurely pace at the front; when he sensed the Skybreaking Shuttle behind him slow, he would stop on purpose and wait for them to catch up.

In the Skybreaking Shuttle behind him, Zi Long and his son fumed with anger.

For five whole months they had been unable to catch Yang Kai; Zi Long could hardly believe a cultivator of the Origin Returning Realm could maintain such sustained swiftness, such terrifying endurance and inexhaustible power.

He had long sensed something amiss — Yang Kai's behavior gave him the feeling of being fished; Yang Kai was the angler, and they were the foolish fish.

Yet even sensing something wrong, Zi Long could not lightly give up.

Things had already come to this point; giving up equaled defeat — how could Zi Long accept that?

So he gritted his teeth and kept pursuit of Yang Kai.

Xu Wei, after taking a Great Emperor Blood Pill once, had become a walking bag of skin and bones again, and this time it was worse than before — his eyes had become extremely dim, with pinpoint white lights within; the gaunt body sitting in the formation trembled as if ready to depart for the Yellow Springs at any moment.

Zi Donglai occasionally scolded him aloud; Xu Wei had no strength to answer.

In his condition, an ordinary martial artist would have long since been dead; fortunately Xu Wei was a powerful figure of the Void King Realm, and could barely hold onto his last breath.

But after this affair he would certainly be broken, unlikely to live long.

Farther back, Ghost Ancestor, who had used secret arts, led Ni Guang and Xue Yue, both probing for Yang Kai's direction while giving chase with all their might.

Kong Fa trailed at the very end, as if no one was even aware of his presence.

“It’s been too long, old ghost. Are you sure Yang Kai’s still alive? He hasn’t been caught by Zi Long, has he?” Ni Guang shouted while following close behind Ghost Ancestor.

“Mm. The boy Yang is safe, you can rest easy,” Ghost Ancestor replied. “Back in the Lost Realm, I left a fragment of soul from my Ten Thousand Souls Banner within his body. If he had died, that fragment would have been annihilated as well. Now I’m using the subtle link between the Banner and that fragment to track his location—there’s no mistaking it.”

"That's a relief then." Ni Guang said, glancing at Xue Yue and noting she exhaled in relief, he could not help a private sigh.

Had this not concerned the Everlasting Tree and Xue Yue, he would not have pursued no matter what.

He had never experienced such a long pursuit before. Even back when he was gravely injured and hunted down, it had only lasted for about a month. At that time, Chairman Ai Ou had led a large group of comrades to his aid, slaughtering every one of his pursuers and helping him vent his fury to the fullest.

Now, thinking back, the thousand-year old matters were all vivid in his mind.

"Eh!" As he spoke, Ghost Ancestor's expression suddenly changed.

"What is it?"

Ghost Ancestor turned his head and looked at Ni Guang in astonishment, saying slowly, "My soul fragment... has disappeared."

"What?" Ni Guang exclaimed in alarm.

Xue Yue went pale at the news and nearly fainted.

Ghost Ancestor had just said that as long as Yang Kai lived, his Ten Thousand Souls Banner could resonate with that soul fragment; but now the soul fragment had actually vanished — did that mean Yang Kai had...?

Xue Yue could not bear to think further; her eyes reddened and tears began to well up.

"Are you mistaken?" Ni Guang shouted.

"Wait!" Ghost Ancestor frowned, glancing all around, his face thoughtful. "Why does this damned place feel so familiar to me?"

“At a time like this, why are you still studying the place?” Ni Guang kept winking at Ghost Ancestor, hinting that Xue Yue’s condition wasn’t good and urging him to smooth things over with a few comforting words.

"Ha!" Ghost Ancestor suddenly brightened and laughed heartily, "I remember now — it's here."

"Fuck!" Even the usually suave Ni Guang couldn't help but curse; he thought the old ghost must be stupid — he'd been glaring so clearly and the old ghost hadn't seen it.

Ghost Ancestor was unconcerned and instead chuckled, saying to Xue Yue, "Girl, don't worry — the boy Yang isn't dead."

"But... but you just said..." Xue Yue looked at him anxiously.

"I never said Yang was dead; I only said the soul fragment was missing," Ghost Ancestor laughed lightly. "I was flustered just now and didn't sense clearly. Well then — the soul fragment is indeed missing, but it wasn't destroyed; it's more like... if I were in the Lost Realm I could not sense the soul fragment outside the Lost Realm. Do you understand what I mean?"

"What exactly are you trying to say?" Ni Guang glanced at him sideways.

"Ha ha, you only need to know Yang isn't dead, and besides, I already know where he's gone." Ghost Ancestor laughed, summoned back his Ten Thousand Souls Banner, then waved his great hand: "Let's go. Believe me, Zi Long is probably so frustrated he's about to vomit blood."

“You know that too?” Ni Guang found it impossible to believe him. In his mind, this old ghost was utterly unreliable. With someone like him in Yang Kai’s sect, Ni Guang truly didn’t know whether it was a blessing or a curse.

"Heh heh, you wait and see."

The three pressed on together.

One hour later Ni Guang's eyes narrowed as he looked ahead to several figures standing in the void not far off.

The one in the middle — who else could it be but Zi Long?

Sensing Ni Guang and the others' auras, Zi Long turned his head and looked coldly.

Their gazes met and Ni Guang laughed out loud, "Ha ha, the bastard really does look properly miserable."

"I told you so." Ghost Ancestor looked as if he had foreseen it.

"How did you know?" Ni Guang was genuinely curious now.

"He didn't succeed, so of course he's miserable. And after chasing for five months and suddenly losing Yang Kai's trail, imagine how he feels," Ghost Ancestor explained lightly.

Ni Guang furrowed his brow and sank into thought. After a moment, he let out a heavy sigh. “What a damn humiliation—especially since Yang Kai’s just an Origin Returning cultivator. Hell, if I were Zi Long, I’d just kill myself.”

Saying that, he laughed incessantly with schadenfreude.

"Wait, how do you know Yang Kai escaped?" Ni Guang suddenly realized something and looked at Ghost Ancestor in surprise.

“Because this place… I’ve been here before. Yes, I spent two thousand years in this very place. So I know that boy Yang has escaped— and I also know where he went!”
