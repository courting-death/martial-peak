## Chapter 1516 — Promising

A formidable enemy! Qu Zheng thought to himself; he'd heard that this strange creature could take a full-force blow from the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm head-on—whether that was true he could not tell.

Before the thought finished, Yang Kai raised his hand again; the Dragon Bone Dripping Jade Sword materialized in his palm, Saint Yuan poured inward, and the jade-green giant dragon immediately shook its head and lashed its tail into being, coiling behind him, rising up to show its upper body, glaring with two eyes larger than bronze gongs, fixing the crowd with a ferocious stare.

The dragon's might washed over the chamber, making hearts tremble and nerves fray.

Hissing, the Golden Blood Threads bounced and the golden light they emitted dazzled unbearably.

A clear birdcall rang out, the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird spread its twin wings, and the temperature in the sealed chamber abruptly spiked by a full degree.

Yang Kai stood ready!

Although the people before him were already like startled birds, Yang Kai did not underestimate them for a moment; outnumbered, he could not afford carelessness, and besides, Qu Zheng still stood unharmed.

Yang Kai had never fought Qu Zheng before, only once seeing him display his might in the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

That Great Sun Wish-Fulfillment Seal had left a deep impression.

So once he acted, Yang Kai unleashed eighty percent of the methods he could employ.

“Alliance Master Qu, when you made things difficult for me that day, did you ever imagine you’d end up like this?” Yang Kai stared coldly at Qu Zheng. “There was never much enmity between our two sides, yet Alliance Master Qu pressed on relentlessly. The grudge of that day—this junior has come to settle it. I’ll see you off to reunite with Qu Changfeng. After all, you are father and son; I imagine Qu Changfeng must be feeling quite lonely right now.”

"You impudent brat!" Qu Zheng's face suddenly twisted into a bestial snarl, as if gone mad.

The death of Qu Changfeng was the greatest wound in his heart! He knew his own child well. Although Qu Changfeng had been wantonly arrogant, his talent had been first-rate. Given time, he would surely have become a great figure.

But he never expected that in the Fallen Emperor Mountains he would be killed outright by Yang Kai.

And now, that killer stood before him boasting; no temper, however good, could tolerate that, especially since he was already hot-blooded by nature.

“Good, good, good! Boy, your arrogance knows no bounds! If this old man doesn’t kill you today, I swear I am no longer a man!” Qu Zheng roared in fury.

Mo Xiaosheng felt something was gravely wrong. Duels between masters were deadly affairs; now, with a few words, the Alliance Master had been provoked into wrath—how could he still fight at full strength? He couldn't stop it now; he could only bite down on the pain at his wound and shout: "Yang Kai, you take the Battle Sky Alliance far too lightly—daring to come in alone. Today this place will be your grave. Everyone, strike together; either he dies or we do!"

At his words, the remaining men drew forth their Secret Treasures; for a time the chamber was awash with radiant light and roiling energy.

Liang Yong moved the quickest. A long-sword-shaped Secret Treasure was produced and frantically filled with Saint Yuan; his face cruel as he glared at Yang Kai and snarled, "Die, brat!"

When the words fell, the long sword transformed into a streak of azure light and shot directly at Yang Kai.

At the same time, the others also unleashed their Secret Treasures' powers, bombarding Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's expression was indifferent; he showed no intent to dodge, only watching coldly as if wholly unaware that danger was descending.

Bang, bang, bang...

The Stone Puppet beat its own hardened chest with one hand, producing a dull thud; baring fangs like a crazed ape, it rapidly enlarged in the pounding, in an instant becoming a stone colossus over ten-odd zhang tall, majestic as it stood in front of Yang Kai.

In the next moment, various Secret Treasure powers flared across the Stone Puppet, dazzling firelight and sharp sounds resounded, yet it did not budge; not only did it refuse to retreat, it bore no wound—only under the barrage of force did its body step back a single pace.

The Stone Puppet's innate divine art was to devour minerals; it could not only refine mineral essences but absorb them for its own use, strengthening itself.

Over the years the Stone Puppet had devoured countless minerals, many of them exceedingly rare and high-grade; not only had it provided great convenience for Yang Yan's forging, it had also greatly nourished and grown itself.

These attacks were terrifying, yet when they struck the Stone Puppet they accomplished little.

The Puppet's body was as hard as any Void King-Grade defensive Secret Treasure.

Amid the crisp impacts, a muffled groan and a mad roar came from Qu Zheng.

Everyone frowned, unsure what had happened to Qu Zheng.

Even Yang Kai was baffled.

As the Secret Treasure powers faded and the lights vanished, Yang Kai's gaze passed over the Stone Puppet to Qu Zheng, and he couldn't help but utter a light "huh", his expression odd.

He found half a sword tip protruding from Qu Zheng's chest—as if someone had stabbed him from behind—blood pouring, his stance staggering, his face ghastly pale.

The long sword was clearly of uncommon quality, certainly at least a Middle-Level Origin-Grade Secret Treasure; greenish eerie light drifted along the blade, constantly spurting terrifying power from within, continuously tearing at Qu Zheng's body and worsening his condition.

Not far beside Qu Zheng, Liang Yong's eyes were complex as if tinged with guilt.

"Liang Yong, how dare you!" Mo Xiaosheng looked at Liang Yong in disbelief, shouting in grief.

Qu Zheng also glared at Liang Yong with a sinister look, fury on his face; he coughed and through gritted teeth demanded, "When did he bribe you? Was it in the Fallen Emperor Mountains?"

Liang Yong's face twitched; he glanced at Yang Kai and said in a bitter voice, "Sect Master Yang never bribed Liang, it's just... Liang knows that those who see the times are heroes; the Alliance Master and the Great Elder behaved contrary and brought disaster to the alliance; as one of the three elders of the Saint Alliance, I cannot sit idly by!"

“To sell your dignity and still speak so righteously—Liang Yong, I never knew you were such a man.” Qu Zheng laughed in fury.

He could not have imagined that at this critical moment he would be ambushed by his own Third Elder; had Liang Yong's Secret Treasure long sword not still been stuck in him, he would have doubted the truth.

"Not knowing before is fine, but the Alliance Master should see clearly today." Liang Yong's face flushed and paled in turns, embarrassed perhaps, but at this stage to live he had no choice.

Others might not know how extraordinary Yang Kai was, but he did.

Although they had the numbers and might on their side, a true fight would be far from easy; even if they could defeat Yang Kai, killing him would be impossible.

The strength Yang Kai had revealed was already terrifying enough—but what about those hidden cards he hadn’t shown yet? The last time Liang Yong had leaked secrets, he had barely escaped with his life. He had no desire to experience that a second time.

“Promising!” Yang Kai suddenly grinned. He hadn’t expected things to unfold this way, but it was a development he welcomed. Though he was confident he could slay them all, it would undoubtedly be a hard-fought battle that might force him to reveal all his trump cards. Now that internal strife had broken out among them, the problem had resolved itself.

“Sect Master Yang flatters me.” Liang Yong smiled and cupped his fists, his face full of obsequiousness. Then he turned toward the others and shouted in a deep voice, “A wise bird chooses a good tree to perch upon—surely I don’t need to teach you all this, do I? By now, you should know exactly what to do!”

The Battle Sky Alliance's faces darkened; they looked at one another, trapped in a dilemma.

Yet no one was willing to throw their life away. In the end, everyone’s gaze turned toward Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng, quietly rousing their Saint Yuan in secret.

"Very well!" Qu Zheng laughed loudly. "I never expected the wolves I raised in the Battle Sky Alliance to repay me so—I was truly blind; I never saw your true faces."

"Alliance Master, why say such things?" Liang Yong slowly shook his head. "It's simply the law of the jungle. Great Elder, what will you do? I've always admired you; if you are willing..."

"You think I would collude with you? You rascals, do not insult me." Mo Xiaosheng sneered, cutting Liang Yong off before he finished.

“In that case, Great Elder, Alliance Master—please take the road together!” Liang Yong’s expression hardened as he waved his hand. In the next instant, the Secret Treasures and Secret Arts that had been aimed at Yang Kai all turned and struck toward Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng instead.

There was no suspense; half a teacup later the fighting subsided.

Mo Xiaosheng lost an arm; though not life-threatening, it affected his strength, while Qu Zheng fared worse—having been betrayed from behind by Liang Yong, a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, it was only because he was powerful that he did not die on the spot.

Both men were wounded—how could they withstand the attacks of Liang Yong and the others?

Yang Kai hadn't even acted and yet the Battle Sky Alliance's Alliance Master and Great Elder had already been struck down by the others.

He did not relax his vigilance; the jade-green giant dragon still coiled behind him, the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird still flew above, and the Stone Puppet remained barring the way.

Once the fighting subsided, Liang Yong gave a look to a certain warrior, who understood and, without a word, leapt at one of their companions and quickly cut down that Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm companion.

Yang Kai watched with a smile and did not stop it.

"Reporting to Sect Master Yang, that Protector Liu is a close retainer of the Alliance Master and is very close to him; though temporarily subdued, hearts are uncertain—who knows if he won't wait for an opportunity to avenge the Alliance Master, so he cannot be left alive." Liang Yong volunteered the explanation.

"Ruthless and cruel!" Yang Kai smiled and nodded. "I underestimated Elder Liang."

"Sect Master Yang flatters me," Liang Yong laughed dryly.

"And those remaining?"

"These few should be fine."

“Mn.” Yang Kai looked at him with deep meaning, an inexplicable smile curling at his lips. Suddenly, he said, “Elder Liang, do you truly believe this Sect Master wouldn’t slaughter the hound once the rabbit is dead, or put away the bow once all the birds are gone?”

Liang Yong's face changed; even the remaining few grew wary.

Forcing a smile, Liang Yong said, "Sect Master Yang, you jest. We have proved ourselves—please spare our lives!"

“What use would I have for keeping you? You even killed Qu Zheng and Mo Xiaosheng—if I were to let you stay by my side, who’s to say I wouldn’t suffer the same fate one day?” Yang Kai looked at him coldly, his tone turning harsh. As if affected by his mood, the Jade-Green Giant Dragon looming behind him slowly raised its massive body.

The dragon's might swelled even more!
