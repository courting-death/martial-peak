## Chapter 2147 — Do You Have No Shame

As soon as the enormous phantom appeared, it slowly raised its head and glanced at the energy surging in the sky.

Immediately she opened her mouth and drew a fierce breath.

An astonishing scene unfolded—under her suction, the Heaven-and-Earth Energy meant for Zhang Ruoxi was instead drawn straight into the phantom’s belly, vanishing without a trace!

Afterwards the woman’s phantom lowered its head as it had when appearing, then suddenly shrank back into Zhang Ruoxi’s body, disappearing from sight.

Yet before she left, Yang Kai faintly felt as if she had looked down at him for a moment.

Even without meeting her gaze, Yang Kai was inexplicably struck with terror, a sense of insignificance and smallness welling up inside him.

“What was that…” Liu Yan’s voice trembled. Although the strange phantom had vanished, the fear it brought her hadn’t faded, leaving her chilled to the bone.

Yang Kai numbly shook his head.

"Boom…"

A ring of energy light exploded outward from Zhang Ruoxi, radiating in all directions.

After the phantom retreated into her body, she broke through to the Origin Returning Realm effortlessly—smooth as flowing water.

Yang Kai was nearly dumbfounded.

Whether it was Zhang Ruoxi condensing her own Shi earlier, the appearance of the bizarre phantom, or her abrupt advancement now, all of it was beyond his comprehension.

Everything about this felt unreal!

At this moment only one thought lingered in his mind: what kind of bloodline power had Zhang Ruoxi inherited? Was that phantom a projection of the Zhang Family ancestor’s will?

"Master, I’d like to return first," Liu Yan said suddenly.

Yang Kai glanced at her and noticed something was off. Not pressing the matter, he nodded and led her into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Meanwhile, Zhang Ruoxi, who had advanced to the Dao Origin Realm, showed no signs of stopping. She continued to madly devour the surrounding Spiritual Qi. Her petite body had become like a bottomless pit, able to absorb any amount of Spiritual Qi that came her way.

With the Xuan Realm Pearl’s absorption working in tandem, the sea of Spiritual Qi at the bottom of the canyon rapidly thinned.

After a day, the canyon, once shrouded in mist and clouds, was no longer as it had been. The sea of Spiritual Qi had vanished, making it just like any other place in the Four Seasons Land.

Only then did a delicate cry come from Zhang Ruoxi’s side, and she slowly opened her eyes.

She seemed a bit bewildered by the changes in herself. After opening her eyes, she frowned slightly, spread her hands out in front of her, and gently clenched them…

After a while, she finally came to her senses, noticed someone watching her, and looked up to meet Yang Kai’s gaze.

“Sir!” Zhang Ruoxi stood up and softly called out.

“Congratulations, you’ve successfully broken through to the Origin Returning Realm,” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Zhang Ruoxi pursed her lips and said, “I don’t know what happened. It feels like I just slept and became like this.”

“Slept?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows. “So you have no idea what happened before?”

Zhang Ruoxi looked up in surprise and asked, “What happened before?”

She turned to look around and immediately spotted two shriveled corpses. Startled, she cried out, her face turning pale, and said with lingering fear, “Did someone ambush us?”

Yang Kai smiled bitterly and shook his head. He didn’t know how to explain those strange scenes to her, so he simply said, “Just a few fools who didn’t know their place.”

But Zhang Ruoxi’s reaction gave him some guesses.

It’s said that some powerful exotic beasts, especially Divine Spirits, are born with considerable strength. Their power grows not through arduous cultivation, but simply by waiting for time to accumulate—their bloodline power slowly awakens and matures, eventually placing them at the pinnacle of the world.

Zhang Ruoxi’s situation was somewhat similar to the inheritance of those Demonic Beasts or Divine Spirits. Otherwise, there was no way to explain her massive increase in strength over just two days, with her being completely unaware of it.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai asked, “Ruoxi, has anyone ever explained the advancement to the Origin Returning Realm and the condensation of Shi to you?”

“No.” Zhang Ruoxi shook her head. “Back home, my strength was still low. The ancestor said he’d explain it when I reached the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm…”

Yang Kai nodded at her words. He remembered he hadn’t explained these things to Zhang Ruoxi either.

Advancing to the Origin Returning Realm was one thing—even without understanding, one could figure it out on their own in the moment.

But condensing Shi isn’t something that can be grasped overnight. Yet Zhang Ruoxi had done it in one go!

In other words, the method for condensing Shi was likely already deeply rooted in her soul—this was definitely the result of bloodline inheritance.

“Sir, did something go wrong with my cultivation?” Zhang Ruoxi asked anxiously.

“Not at all.” Yang Kai quickly shook his head to prevent any misunderstanding, then added, “You’ve just advanced, so it’s important to stabilize your cultivation. Return to the Small Xuan Realm first.”

"Yes!" Zhang Ruoxi nodded meekly, loosening her breath and spirit as she allowed Yang Kai to draw her into the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Standing and pondering for a while, Yang Kai still couldn’t make sense of it. He hadn’t asked Zhang Ruoxi about the giant woman’s phantom—she likely couldn’t offer any explanation.

After a moment, he turned to look to the side. Not far away, a streak of light rapidly approached.

Soon, Hua Qingsi appeared before him, looking quite pleased—clearly she’d gained a lot.

"What happened?" Hua Qingsi exclaimed when she saw the two dried corpses on the ground.

"Just some troublemakers," Yang Kai said blandly. He didn’t ask what she’d found—her harvests were hers, per their agreement. "Come back first, I still need to head to the Winter Domain."

“Wait!”

“What is it?”

Hua Qingsi smiled and said, “I suddenly remembered something on the way back.”

Yang Kai didn’t reply, just signaled with his eyes for her to continue.

"There’s a hidden stash in Two Seasons Mountain. Interested in exploring it?" Hua Qingsi asked with a smile.

“How do you know?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Hua Qingsi said, “I’m from the Star God Palace! If all went well, I’d be one of the forty chosen this time. I’ve been preparing for the Four Seasons Land for a long while—what’s so strange about me knowing of a hidden stash?”

“Two Seasons Mountain?” Yang Kai showed a thoughtful look.

“Don’t worry, I don’t know what you’re doing in the Winter Domain, but this is just on the way. It won’t take much time.”

"Do you have the exact location?" Yang Kai asked.

Hua Qingsi rolled her eyes. "That stash is something I pieced together from clues in the sect’s records. There’s a map, but it’s vague—it only marks a general area. If we go, we’ll have to search for it ourselves."

"So you don’t know what’s inside either?" Yang Kai asked.

Seeing his reluctance, Hua Qingsi pouted. "Looks like you don’t know much about the Four Seasons Land!"

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai frowned.

Hua Qingsi giggled, “Do you know who created the Four Seasons Land?”

“You know?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

Hua Qingsi said proudly, “If I didn’t, why would I ask you?”

Yang Kai grinned fiercely, “Speak!”

Seeing his threatening look, Hua Qingsi pursed her lips and snorted, “The Great Emperor of Time—have you heard of him?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

Hua Qingsi’s expression tightened. “Since ancient times, any being worthy of the title Great Emperor has stood at the very pinnacle of this world. Yet even those at the pinnacle are not exempt from falling. According to the historical records, no fewer than several dozen Great Emperors have perished. The Emperor of Time was one such figure. He cultivated the Time Requiem Divine Art. When he unleashed its secret technique—A Thousand Years in a Breath—a millennium would pass in an instant. Those struck by it would have their lifespan silently stripped away, dying a natural death without ever realizing what had happened.”

“No one knows exactly how this Great Emperor fell, but legend has it… the Four Seasons Land is one of his secret abodes. The power of the four seasons in the secret realm is a manifestation of his divine technique, lingering for countless years. There’s also a rumor that somewhere in the Four Seasons Land stands a majestic temple called the Time Temple, containing endless treasures left by the Great Emperor of Time. If you obtain even a little, your future will be smooth and unimpeded. This rumor has circulated among all the major sects, but no one has ever confirmed it—only vague records exist. The stash I mentioned is very likely related to the Time Temple!”

Her proud narration indeed piqued Yang Kai’s interest.

“But since you find it troublesome, let’s not go,” Hua Qingsi teased, deliberately keeping Yang Kai in suspense.

Yang Kai decisively reached out his hand to her.

"What are you doing?" Hua Qingsi asked warily.

"Hand over the map!" Yang Kai ordered.

Hua Qingsi immediately covered her Spatial Ring and jumped back a few steps, gritting her teeth. "I warn you, if you try anything, I’ll—"

"You’ll what?" Yang Kai grinned menacingly as he approached. "There’s no one around—if you scream, no one will come. Besides… with just a thought, you’ll obediently hand over the map!"

"You shameless brute! Don’t come any closer… If you do, I’ll scream… Fine, fine, I’ll give it to you." Hua Qingsi pulled a piece of beast hide from her Spatial Ring and threw it to Yang Kai, indignantly scolding, "Is this fun for you? A grown man bullying a weak woman—do you have no shame?"

Yang Kai ignored her and examined the crude map drawn on the beast hide. Just as Hua Qingsi said, there weren’t many clues, and the directions were unclear.
