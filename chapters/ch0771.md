## Chapter 771 — Cannot End Peacefully

Within the heart of the Divine Tree, Yang Kai repeatedly transmitted his Divine Sense, guiding and refining the tree's consciousness.

Over time he came to treat the Divine Tree as a true living being; it had feelings, thoughts, and judgments—not merely a towering tree.

Under that premise, the Divine Tree grew ever more affectionate toward him, dropping all defenses and opening its heart.

Its faint awareness resembled an innocent, mischievous infant; whenever Yang Kai's Spirit Body slipped into the tree's core, it would be overjoyed, wrapping and tugging at him, weaving through the trunk as if proudly showing off its own body.

Its consciousness was utterly simple now—like a sheet of pristine paper untouched by stain—expressing joy, anger, sorrow, and delight without reserve.

When Yang Kai arrived it was pleased; when he wished to leave it became crestfallen and reluctant. Many times, even in slumber, its soul-energy would cling tightly to Yang Kai's Spirit Body, unwilling to let him go.

Yang Kai was delighted and, from the bottom of his heart, grew fond of this pure, delicate life; its simplicity and innocence filled him with a strange shame.

Through their playful interactions, the Divine Tree's awareness was rapidly maturing.

One day, as Yang Kai sent his Spirit Body into the tree's core, a clear, unmistakable Divine Sense greeted him from ahead; soon the tree's awareness surged forward, hovering before him and enfolding him tenderly.

Yang Kai paused, dumbstruck for a long moment before he attempted to convey a message to the Divine Tree.

To his surprise, after a brief reverie it answered quickly; though not perfectly articulate, Yang Kai could at least grasp what it meant to tell him.

A grin split Yang Kai's face— the Divine Tree's consciousness had finally been born.

Thanks to his long-term supply of Yang Liquid, it had successfully evolved into another form of life. Yang Kai deserved great credit for this; without him the tree would have evolved eventually, but this process had been advanced by a large margin.

A strong sense of accomplishment welled up within him.

It was like watching a child he had raised finally stand—growing from babbling speech to tentative steps.

Yet there was still much for it to learn.

Yang Kai immediately began instructing it: how to express emotion, how to converse properly. But the little creature was too playful—it preferred frolicking with Yang Kai to learning, and it was unclear how much it actually absorbed.

After a while, Yang Kai withdrew his Spirit Body from the tree's core and rubbed his aching forehead.

As he felt helpless, many branches suddenly extended beside him, and at the same time a Divine Sense poured into his mind, conveying a message.

Yang Kai froze and looked up at the extending branches—each branch bore a golden fruit.

"Gifts for me?" Yang Kai asked quickly.

The branches trembled lightly, as if nodding.

Yang Kai couldn't help but smile and shook his head in reply. "I appreciate the thought, but I can't take these fruits."

Below, Yang Clan experts were watching. If he took those fruits he'd surely cause trouble. Though he'd long coveted these energy-laden fruits, he had never once plucked one.

The Divine Tree refused to relent. It stubbornly thrust the branches toward him as if vowing never to give up until he accepted them.

No matter how Yang Kai tried to refuse, the fruits eventually detached of their own accord and fell into his arms.

Yang Kai's face darkened—now there was no explaining it away.

The Divine Tree, as if proud of its deed, drew the branches back and swayed in the wind.

Yang Kai was both amused and exasperated. Staring at the six or seven fruits of differing vintages in his arms, he could neither keep them nor return them. After thinking for a moment, he leapt down from the trunk and called out.

Several Yang Clan experts who had been watching nearby came over at the sound. Just as they were about to speak, their eyes fell on the fruits in Yang Kai's arms and they erupted with fury.

"You brat, you dare to steal the Divine Tree's fruit? You're asking for death!" one shouted, hair on end; he steamed with rage, his True Yuan surging, ready to strike.

Yang Kai stared coldly and frowned. "I didn't steal them—they fell on their own."

"What nonsense! The Divine Tree's fruits won't fall even after hanging for centuries unless plucked. You sure spin a fine tale, boy."

"If I had stolen them, I'd have eaten them already," Yang Kai said, unwilling to waste breath on argument, and he tossed the fruits toward them.

They hastily caught them, scowling at him.

The man who'd spoken sneered coldly, "Don't think you can escape punishment this easily. We'll report this to the leader and see how he wants to deal with you!"

Yang Kai shrugged with a look of indifference.

At that moment, a terrifying surge of energy exploded forth. The air filled with a frenzied aura as streaking, golden, whip-like attacks swept out from the front, blanketing those Yang Clan experts.

Sensing danger, their faces changed; they tried to leap aside.

But the assaults were swift and relentless—countless in number and vast in range—and struck them before they could escape.

A staccato of pops rang out, interspersed with muffled groans. The Yang Clan fighters were flung bloodily through the air, utterly defenseless against the onslaught.

One weaker man was slammed into a crimson mist, his body obliterated without a bone left.

Yang Kai stood frozen; An Ling'er trembled behind him, clutching him, her delicate form shuddering as she stared dumbly at the scene.

The Yang Clan warriors who were already airborne and bleeding still hadn't understood what struck them when an overwhelming golden light struck again; even prepared, they could not withstand such indiscriminate fury.

Pop, pop, pop—

The popping sounds never ceased. Each Yang Clan fighter was struck at least a hundred times; in a blink four or five lay dead, none surviving.

Yang Kai spun and looked with a shaking gaze at the enormous Divine Tree behind him.

The air was still, yet the Divine Tree rustled violently; its dense branches and leaves twisted frenziedly like a raving demon, a grotesque, fearsome spectacle.

From its canopy there hung visible strands of golden energy, like thick, long whips—razor-sharp.

Those slain Yang Clan fighters had been struck by these energy whips.

Blood and shattered corpses littered the ground; the stench of iron filled the air.

Yang Kai clearly felt a hysterical, furious emotion emanate from within the Divine Tree—apparently enraged by how those men had treated him.

Yang Kai was utterly dumbfounded; he never expected such a turn of events.

He had returned the fruits simply to avoid trouble—he had no guarantee he could escape this place, much less find a way out.

Although he knew better than anyone that the Divine Tree had newly born awareness and was now different, he never imagined it would defend him with such savage directness.

Its attacks lacked pattern and needed none; the colossal energy birthed from its body was the most piercing, lethal assault in the world.

"Yang Kai..." An Ling'er's small frame trembled as she clutched his clothes, eyes wide and bewildered.

Yang Kai regained his senses and hurriedly transmitted a divine thought to the tree; its raging emotion gradually subsided.

The whip-like strands of energy withdrew and scooped the fallen fruits from the ground, delivering them back to Yang Kai.

"It seems... to have a mind of its own," An Ling'er murmured, dazed as she stared at the Divine Tree.

"How do I put it..." Yang Kai smiled wryly.

Just then, the tree's energy tendrils retracted again and plucked every fruit from the branches, petulantly presenting them before Yang Kai.

There were at least sixty or seventy fruits, each brimming with unimaginable power.

Yang Kai drew a deep breath—this time he suspected things would not end peacefully.

The Divine Tree meant well and was simply showing favor; in its view, slaying those men was nothing more than standing up for Yang Kai.

Yet its furious onslaught also astonished Yang Kai—those watchers nearby were all Transcendent Realm experts, but they could not withstand the tree's bombardment and were killed instantly.

A sharp glint flashed in Yang Kai's eyes and a cold light crossed his face. The corner of his mouth rose in a smile.

This could be an opportunity.

"I'll lift the seal on you—take care of yourself!" Yang Kai told An Ling'er, pouring his True Yuan and Divine Sense into her.

He had never minded the seal on her; he simply hadn't removed it to avoid attention. Now that matters had spiraled out of control, he had to throw caution to the wind.

In an instant, An Ling'er felt True Yuan pulse through her and the seal in her Sea of Consciousness shattered with a roar—freedom restored.

At the next moment, figures flooded in from all sides; the Divine Tree's fury had clearly alarmed the Yang Clan. The arriving warriors radiated long, distant breaths and formidable strength.

Seeing the blood and shredded corpses, they were enraged—there was no intention to question Yang Kai; they surged forward with murderous intent, True Yuan flaring.

Yang Kai laughed lightly, casually pocketing the Divine Tree's fruits into Black Book Space. A surge of Divine Sense power then exploded outward toward the crowd, and hidden within those waves of Divine Sense were the Soul Devouring Worms.
