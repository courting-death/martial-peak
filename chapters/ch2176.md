## Chapter 2176 — Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus

Soul Cleansing Divine Water, Immortal Source Liquid, and Life Jade Nectar—these three are known as the Three Divine Waters.

Among them, the birth of Soul Cleansing Divine Water is a matter of great chance. It requires an expert to fall with Divine Soul power lingering at the place of death; only then, through fate, might Soul Cleansing Divine Water be born. Though rare, it is not entirely extinct.

As for the other two, without exception, both are exceedingly hard to find treasures.

Life Jade Nectar might exist somewhere in a hidden corner of the Star Realm, but no one knows where.

But Immortal Source Liquid... there is simply nowhere to seek it.

For Immortal Source Liquid is a derivative of the Everlasting Tree! It is the very essence of the Everlasting Tree's life!

A single drop of Immortal Source Liquid can regrow flesh and bones, bring the dead back to life, and possesses heaven-defying, extraordinary effects.

In this world, the only Everlasting Tree is planted in Yang Kai's own little medicine garden, so naturally, no one else has any way to obtain Immortal Source Liquid.

The drop in his hand was leftover from when he first obtained the Everlasting Tree years ago, and he had never been willing to use it.

To use such a heaven-defying treasure in exchange for a Calamity Fruit—surely no one would refuse.

The only thing to worry about is whether the appearance of Immortal Source Liquid will bring about other troubles.

But for the sake of the Calamity Fruit, he couldn't care that much. If someone really did ask about it, he could just play dumb. No one would ever suspect that a supreme treasure like the Everlasting Tree would actually be in his hands.

Having made up his mind, Yang Kai sat cross-legged and waited quietly.

There were still five or six days left, and the cultivators who had entered the Four Seasons Land were in no hurry to leave. At this moment, they were probably still searching for their own opportunities elsewhere, so the area near the entrance was extremely quiet.

Time passed slowly. After a day, the plain by the entrance still held only Yang Kai, with no sign of anyone else.

At a certain moment, Yang Kai suddenly furrowed his brow and looked in a particular direction.

He had just sensed a strange fluctuation of energy that flashed and disappeared.

But when he looked toward its source, he sensed nothing, leaving him suspicious and unsure if he had imagined it.

As he pondered, a layer of visible ripples suddenly spread out from a distant location.

The ripples were almost tangible, spreading out in all directions like waves.

Yang Kai abruptly stood up and narrowed his eyes to observe.

Ahead, about a hundred li away, atop a mountain peak, ripples surged forth in succession. At first, the ripples were of a single color, but as time passed, they gradually became a dazzling array of colors.

Not only that, but the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth over there seemed to be surging violently. Above the mountain, in the sky, multicolored clouds churned endlessly, making the entire sky appear bizarre and unparalleled.

"A natural phenomenon," Yang Kai murmured. "Is a rare treasure emerging?"

Although he didn't know exactly what was happening over there, judging by the current situation, it was definitely the birth of a rare treasure, and not an ordinary one at that. Otherwise, such a clear phenomenon would not have appeared at its emergence.

"Why at this time..." Yang Kai frowned deeply, his expression darkening.

Now, there were only four or five days left until the exit of the Four Seasons Land closed. If he was right, the disciples of the various sects were probably already making their way back.

And the place where this phenomenon was occurring was only a hundred li from the exit.

In other words, this phenomenon marking the birth of a rare treasure was very likely to attract many people, and the later it got, the more people would be drawn in! At that point, a fierce struggle would be inevitable, and there might even be rivers of blood!

When that happened, his plan to exchange Immortal Source Liquid for a Calamity Fruit would certainly be disrupted.

So, upon seeing this phenomenon, Yang Kai's first reaction was not excitement, but frustration, feeling that the timing was truly most unfortunate for him.

Still, even though he was grumbling inwardly, the phenomenon was already so obvious, so of course he had to go and see for himself!

With that thought, Yang Kai immediately summoned his flying wooden boat, stepped onto it, and urged his Origin Qi, turning into a stream of light as he shot toward that direction.

The wooden boat was very fast; a hundred li could be crossed in less than a dozen breaths. As he drew closer, Yang Kai actually caught a strange fragrance in the air. The scent entered his nose, making his mind clear and refreshed, as if he had been doused with sweet dew...

"Could this be a wondrous herb..." Yang Kai silently judged in his heart. Moreover, it was clearly a rare herb that could aid a cultivator’s advancement, for as that strange fragrance entered his nose, he actually sensed the bottleneck of his First Stage Dao Origin Realm begin to loosen ever so slightly!

He had only recently advanced to the Dao Origin Realm. Although he had fought many battles and cultivated diligently, and had even gained some fortune on the Time Staircase, he was still some distance from advancing to the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Yet now, that distance had suddenly shrunk considerably, showing just how heaven-defying this wondrous herb's effects were.

He couldn't help but be moved. At this moment he was probably the only one early to the plain; if no one else arrived, perhaps he could claim this newly emerged wondrous herb for himself.

This was truly a case of unintended fortune... After all, Yang Kai had come to the entrance early just to inquire about the whereabouts of the Calamity Fruit.

As his thoughts raced, Yang Kai had already arrived near the mountaintop. He landed and stood atop the wooden boat, quietly gazing ahead.

He saw that, at a certain spot on the mountaintop, amidst strange rocks, a flower bud stood quietly.

It appeared to be a lotus, its unopened petals pure white and flawless, without a speck of dust. Dazzling spiritual light flowed endlessly across it, and an enchanting fragrance wafted out, making it seem almost unreal, dreamlike and alluring.

Not only that, but on the flower bud were some intricate runes, each the size of a grain of rice, faintly discernible, as if containing profound mysteries. If one could comprehend them, they would gain boundless benefits.

Yang Kai's heart trembled violently, and he muttered in a low voice, "This is..."

As he spoke, he flipped his hand and took out a jade slip from his Spatial Ring, closed his eyes, and immersed his mind to examine its contents.

The jade slip was something left behind by Gongsun Mu. Yang Kai had long since memorized its contents, but the sight before him still left him uncertain. Only by comparing it with the jade slip could he be sure of his observation.

After a short while, Yang Kai indeed found the answer he sought in the jade slip. He opened his eyes, excitement and fervor flashing within them, and stared at the unopened flower bud, exclaiming in a low voice, "Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus!"

Gongsun Mu's jade slip recorded: The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus is born of the fortune of heaven and earth, formed by absorbing the essence of sun and moon. When it blooms, Emperor Intent fills the four directions. Whoever obtains the Treasure Lotus will have a greatly increased chance of achieving the Emperor Realm. If refined into a pill, the effect is even greater!

In other words, this thing is a heaven-defying treasure that can increase a cultivator's chances of advancing to the Emperor Realm.

The Emperor Realm is already the pinnacle for cultivators of the Star Realm.

Aside from a few nearly extinct miraculous pills and medicines, there is nothing else that can help a cultivator increase their chances of advancing.

And the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus is one of them.

Moreover, it is completely different from ordinary spiritual herbs and medicines. It fundamentally improves a cultivator's comprehension of the Martial Dao, and its effect on condensing one's own Emperor Intent is unmatched by any other spiritual medicine.

The value of such a spiritual medicine is unimaginable! If someone like Xia Sheng or Wuchang were to obtain the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, within five years, they would surely advance to the Emperor Realm, with no chance of failure.

The Emperor Realm is the backbone of every great sect, the true pillar of strength. The birth of each Emperor Realm cultivator is enough to greatly increase a sect's power.

Thinking about it this way, the value of this Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus is simply incalculable...

Yang Kai's heart burned with desire, but soon his expression turned extremely grim.

Because the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus before him... had not yet fully bloomed, and could not be harvested. If he tried to pick it now, its medicinal efficacy would be greatly diminished.

Even if it did fully bloom, it would have to be consumed or refined into a pill within a very short time, or else its medicinal power would quickly dissipate.

In this world, there is always gain and loss.

The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus has such heaven-defying effects, so naturally, it is exceedingly rare.

This is because, after it blooms, it will wither within three hours, its spiritual energy fading away, which is what makes its legendary reputation.

Thus, even if a Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus blooms somewhere in the Star Realm, if it is not discovered within three hours, it will wither and return to the earth, never to be seen again...

"I have to find a way to conceal this phenomenon. Judging by the situation... it won't bloom for a while yet. If this continues, more and more people will be drawn here, and things will get troublesome." Yang Kai muttered to himself, but when he looked up at the obvious phenomenon in the sky, he felt powerless.

If he were proficient in formations, perhaps he could use their power to accomplish this, but his understanding of formations was still at the level of brute force breaking, far from enough to help here.

Putting it into the Small Xuan Realm was also impossible. The Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus cannot be picked before it blooms, much less moved, or it would immediately wither.

As an alchemist, Yang Kai would never allow such wasteful behavior.

For a while, he was so anxious he scratched his head.

Just as he was growing anxious, the sound of something tearing through the air suddenly came, and several figures quickly arrived from different directions, landing not far from him.

Three men and one woman arrived. The woman came with one of the men; the other two arrived alone.

As soon as the four appeared, their gazes all locked onto the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, each showing surprise and shock.

Only the woman, dressed like a young matron, cast a casual glance at Yang Kai; upon seeing he was merely First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, she lost interest.
