## Chapter 1082 — Response

Once Yang Kai understood exactly what method the three had been using to doggedly pursue him, his heart calmed.

Once the method was known, it would be easy to dismantle.

Yang Kai casually slipped the colorful ribbon into his Spatial Ring and looked at the three men with a cold, indifferent gaze.

Since Xue Yue had already stated her position and attitude, he should respond properly and put an end to matters with her.

A sharp shout rang out, and the burly man on the left suddenly unleashed his full strength; seeming to sense the killing intent in Yang Kai's eyes, he didn't hesitate to strike first.

The other two made no move, arms folded, smiling as they watched the show, ready to savor the tragic sight of Yang Kai being mauled.

In their view, Yang Kai was only a martial artist at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; any one of the three of them could easily take him down—there was no reason to fail.

A weighty, mountain-like aura exploded from the burly man's body, warping the vast Starry Sky; from all directions, surges of enormous pressure pressed upon Yang Kai, each like an avalanche or tidal wave—his bones crackled with brittle sounds as if his skeleton were being crushed.

The burly man sneered as a phantom image rose behind him—an apparition in his likeness that quickly swelled; in the blink of an eye it became a towering giant thirty zhang tall. The giant raised a mud-colored foot wrapped in energy and brought it down toward Yang Kai's head.

A soul-extinguishing pressure shot from the giant's eyes, aiming directly at Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness.

Seeing that his opponent had deployed a Soul Technique, Yang Kai cracked a smile and stood there at ease, not dodging, calmly awaiting its intrusion.

If they'd attacked Yang Kai with nothing but physical power, they might at least have been able to hold their own for a while. But to so recklessly employ a Soul Technique without understanding his true depth was sheer folly.

Yang Kai's Divine Sense power far surpassed his physical strength—at the very least it was on par with the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm—and with the strange Divine Sense Fire, even matched against a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm opponent's Soul Technique he need not suffer.

That burly man was only First Stage of the Saint King Realm and thought to bully the weak and end it with one strike—how could he know of Yang Kai's oddities?

Layer upon layer of soul fluctuations, laced with the profound intent the burly man had grasped, poured into Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness; but before those Divine Sense forces could take effect, they were engulfed by a scorching power and burned away in an instant.

The burly man's composed expression abruptly changed. His body trembled, his pupils shrank to pinpricks, and his face went deathly pale.

The Divine Sense Fire and Yang Kai's strange might dealt him a crushing blow; the Divine Sense that invaded Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness was immediately damaged, causing excruciating pain in his head as stars exploded before his eyes—he could barely think.

A wail escaped him as a spear burning with pitch-black Demonic Flame had already formed in Yang Kai's hand; before the man could react, it was hurled at him.

Whoosh...

The sound of space tearing sounded.

Sensing the crisis, the burly man hastily deployed his own power to defend himself. He summoned a Middle-Level Saint King-Grade defensive Secret Treasure to shield him.

The Secret Treasure took the form of an umbrella, spinning round and round. It could deflect many attacks; the man had relied on this umbrella to fend off numerous lethal blows before.

He believed it would work this time as well. If it could block the blow he would live—he still had two comrades who had not acted.

The umbrella Secret Treasure failed to perform its duty. The Demonic Flame spear vanished the moment Yang Kai released it and, the next instant, obscenely reappeared three inches before the burly man's chest.

The spear broke through the spatial barrier and materialized bit by bit from the void; amid the man's horrified screams it pierced through his body as if through iron and stone.

A biting-hot sensation spread from the spear. Black Demonic Flame crawled over his whole body—the chilling cold and raging heat combined left him helpless. No matter how he urged his power, he could not extinguish the Demonic Flame; instead it grew fiercer, burning his clothes, flesh, even his Saint Yuan into fuel and making the blaze roar ever higher.

The burly man was utterly transformed into a rolling ball of black fire; he screamed and wailed, flailing like a headless fly as he tore wildly through the Starry Sky until he vanished.

The two who had been folding their arms and watching the fun changed color; their earlier light-hearted air was gone, each wearing an expression gravely severe, deep eyes swelling with dread and horror.

They knew of fighting above one's Stage; those who became warriors under the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch each had their specialties and could sometimes fight up a rank, but even when victorious it would be a bitter win.

To kill a higher-ranked martial artist in a blink when separated by a whole realm was something they had never dared imagine—yet it was unfolding before their eyes.

They instantly realized how terrifying Yang Kai was and understood they had probably taken on a task far beyond themselves.

With no discussion and no exchanged glances, the two struck at Yang Kai at the same time, holding nothing back and intent on quickly dealing with him.

One of them produced a drum-shaped Secret Treasure; as he charged at Yang Kai, the drumstick in his hand slammed into the drum face.

Boom...

The sonorous boom seemed to reach to the deepest reaches of the Star Domain, and with it a weighty murderous intent surged toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai opened his left hand; his Vast Heaven Shield had only just formed when the invisible assault struck. The shield's surface was violently driven inward as if hit by a ferocious blow and nearly collapsed.

The other man brandished a long sword, sword intent icy; rainbow lights shot from the blade, combining with the drum's sonic attack to relentlessly pummel Yang Kai as if their lives depended on it.

The Vast Heaven Shield endured fewer than three breaths before shattering.

Those at the Saint King Realm were no longer mere small fry — each of them had endured countless life-and-death battles and spent endless years painstakingly cultivating to reach their present strength.

Facing the two's all-out joint assault, Yang Kai could not be careless even for a moment.

Demonic Flame churned over his body; a pitch-black great dragon rose behind him, and with a resonant dragon cry it swung its head and tail, eyes like houses glaring as it charged the two attackers.

Yang Kai stood atop the dragon's head; his vast, sea-like Divine Sense surged at the two men while his hands never paused, condensing Saint Yuan and unleashing the Nine Heavens Divine Technique with its spatial mysteries. The Profound Heaven Sword, Heaven-Slaying Spear, Heaven-Covering Palm—each strike pierced spatial seals, vanishing here and appearing there, leaving the two unable to defend.

Through his cultivation Yang Kai had learned one thing: Martial Skill was not strictly a matter of good or bad.

As one's own strength rose and one understood the mysteries of power, even low-grade Martial Skills could be made to perform tremendous deeds.

They were not like Secret Treasures—low-grade Secret Treasures are forever low-grade, unable to be turned into high-grade tools or cope with top-tier combat.

Martial Skill, however, is the flexible application of force; in the end, when one masters their power, techniques are unnecessary—control alone allows one to adapt to the ebb and flow of battle.

The cultivation of Martial Skill merely provides a framework for the inexperienced, letting them, through techniques, apprehend the mysteries of their strength.

Therefore, after coming to the Star Domain, Yang Kai's Secret Treasures and herbs from Tongxuan Continent were mostly useless, save for the Warm Spirit Lotus and the World-Ending Demon Eye; Martial Skills, however, remained at his command.

The black dragon exuded a savage aura that nearly split those two Saint King Realm warriors asunder; they threw their all at Yang Kai and the black dragon but could not inflict meaningful harm.

The black dragon pressed down like a collapsing mountain; the boundless pressure left them almost immobile.

The dragon's huge maw opened, swallowing one man whole and clamping down on the other's body. Though it did not sever him, the black Demonic Flame crawled across his flesh—no matter how he struggled he could not extinguish it, and he met the same doom as the first burly man.

Their screams gradually faded until silence.

The black dragon dispersed, becoming clusters of flames that surged into Yang Kai's body.

In the vast Starry Sky, only two charred corpses remained.

Yang Kai stood in place for a long while but, unlike before, did not absorb the souls' Divine Sense.

He shook his head helplessly, knowing the two's Divine Sense had likely been consumed entirely by the Demonic Flame.

There was no use lamenting; Yang Kai glanced in the direction of Rainfall Star, summoned the Star Shuttle, and vanished.

Rainfall Star—the palace where the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch was located.

Xue Yue, clad in a deep-red palace gown, sat with her beautiful eyes closed, motionless; her face was unreadable, neither pleased nor angry.

Halika, Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman stood at her side, occasionally exchanging glances, yet none dared to speak.

The atmosphere within the main hall was oppressively tense.

They had no idea how this had come about—Xue Yue had actually dispatched three First Stage of the Saint King Realm warriors to pursue and kill Yang Kai after he left.

Yang Kai had labored for nearly a year to wake Xue Yue; Halika and the others had witnessed it. They could not fathom how the master and servant had become enemies.

Could that brat have toyed with her affections and then discarded her? Such speculation crossed Halika and the others' minds.

Moreover, Elder Zong actually paid no attention to the matter and chose not to interfere.

The three branch leaders were nearly frantic with worry.

While they were guessing, Halika's expression suddenly changed. He took out a wooden plaque-like object from his Spatial Ring, examined it briefly, cupped his fists and said, "Lady Xue, Black Eagle's team of three... is dead!"

Xue Yue's beautiful eyes slowly opened, showing little surprise; the frown that had tormented her smoothed as if some burden had been released, and she exhaled a long breath.
