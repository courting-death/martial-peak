## Chapter 405 — Give Me an Explanation

In the study, Fourth Master Yang sat upright, while Dong Suzhu chuckled lightly. Beside them sat a sturdy man and a charming woman, who were the two Blood Servants that came to welcome Yang Kai back to Zhongdu, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

Seeing Yang Kai return, they quickly stood up from their seats and cupped their hands in greeting, “Young Master!”

Yang Kai smiled in response, “Sit down.”

Only then did Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian take their seats again. When they looked at Yang Kai, they could not help but be astonished. They discovered that Yang Kai had actually broken through a layer and reached the level of True Essence Realm Eighth Stage.

It hadn’t been long since his last breakthrough, probably less than two months. This speed was truly astonishing.

During Yang Kai's last breakthrough to True Essence Realm Seventh Stage, they had been present. At that time, it was their first meeting, and they felt he had good talent. Now, seeing him again, it was more than good; his talent was simply extraordinary.

But why did the rumors say he had only stayed in the Transformation Dragon Pool for half a day before coming out? As they thought about it, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian shook their heads quietly, feeling somewhat confused.

“Kai’er, you also sit down.” Fourth Master Yang said in a deep voice, “There are some matters I need to discuss with you.”

“Alright.” Seeing his serious demeanor, Yang Kai realized that things were somewhat unusual and hurriedly sat down beside Dong Suzhu.

After they settled in, there was a moment of silence. Only Yang Yingfeng furrowed his brows, and after a long while, he said, “Let’s talk about the first matter. Yesterday, the Elder Court issued a directive to all the main houses regarding the struggle for succession. It’s considered good news—during this struggle, the Blood Servants from the Blood Servants Hall will participate!”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, unable to hide his joy.

The Blood Servants from the Blood Servants Hall are all among the strongest. In the realm of Divine Roaming, they rarely encounter worthy opponents, unless facing experts from powerful factions.

With the assistance of the Blood Servants, the struggle for succession would be much easier.

“This is good news,” Yang Kai said in surprise, not understanding why Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, along with Fourth Master Yang, appeared to have frowning faces.

“It is indeed good news.” Yang Yingfeng nodded. “However, the Elder Court has issued an order that while the Blood Servants from the Blood Servants Hall will participate in the struggle for succession, their task is solely to protect your safety and they cannot be responsible for anything else.”

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed slightly as he contemplated, “So, they can only defend passively and cannot take the initiative to attack?”

“Exactly. The strength of the Blood Servants is too great; if they were to take the initiative, they could easily resolve an opponent,” Yang Yingfeng nodded. “This is also due to the concern that you might not be able to pull in sufficiently strong allies.”

“I understand.” Yang Kai smiled at Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, “But to obtain the help of the Blood Servants, are there any conditions?”

The two Blood Servants were taken aback, surprised that Yang Kai could guess this. Yang Yingfeng also nodded with a smile, “There are conditions. You must contribute a certain amount of merits to the family, worthy of your status. For example, the abilities you have learned in other sects over the past few years!”

The Elder Court’s order undoubtedly requires the main disciples of the Yang Family to disclose all the unpassed secrets from their respective sects.

This is something the family does every time before a struggle for succession, using it to collect worldly treasures.

Thus, the Yang Family’s accumulation of martial skills and cultivation methods is extensive and rich. In terms of the amount of martial arts and cultivation techniques stored, the Yang Family absolutely ranks first in the realm, unmatched even by the other seven great families.

“The more you contribute, the stronger the Blood Servants you can obtain, and the more options you will have!”

Although all Blood Servants are powerful, within the Blood Servants Hall, there are still differences in their strength. Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian are among the stronger ones, but there are even more powerful Blood Servants above them, which reach the strength of Divine Roaming Realm Ninth Stage.

“Moreover, each person can obtain no more than two Blood Servants at most! That is the limit,” Yang Yingfeng added.

“Hehe…” Yang Kai chuckled awkwardly, “Father, are you worried that I won’t have enough to exchange for the help of two Blood Servants?”

Yang Yingfeng nodded seriously.

Last time, Yang Kai had submitted a set of Mystery-Grade Martial Skills to the Xiang Family in exchange for a Golden Feather Eagle. Yang Yingfeng thought that after so many years, it would be impressive if his son could learn even one set of Mystery-Grade techniques, so where would he have the excess?

“You don’t need to worry about that; I have preparations,” Yang Kai replied confidently, smiling at those present, who were not outsiders, and he had no need to keep secrets.

Yang Yingfeng suddenly thought of Wan Yao Ling Ye and frowned, “Could it be that you want to use that thing?”

Wan Yao Ling Ye is incredibly miraculous. If Yang Kai reveals it, he could definitely obtain the help of two Blood Servants. However, the family would not sit idly by; it could very well cause some trouble. As a father, Fourth Master Yang naturally worried.

Yang Kai shook his head.

Yang Yingfeng finally grew concerned, realizing at this moment that he truly did not understand how much foundation his son possessed.

After looking at Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, Yang Kai smiled and said, “Tu Feng, Yuxian, it seems we really will work together from now on.”

He thought that the two Blood Servants came this time for this very matter. During the journey back to Zhongdu, Tu Feng and Yuxian had already stated that if the family allowed the Blood Servants to participate in the struggle for succession, they would definitely follow Yang Kai and serve him.

The promise made that day lingered in their ears, and neither Tu Feng nor Tang Yuxian would forget it; naturally, Yang Kai also would not forget it!

Now was the time to redeem that promise.

Unexpectedly, after Yang Kai finished speaking, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian showed no joy. Instead, they wore wry, bitter smiles, their gazes shifting away, unable to meet Yang Kai’s eyes.

Yang Kai’s smile slowly faded, his expression turning cold as he lightly snorted, “Do you both need to give me an explanation?”

Their expressions revealed many issues.

However, whether it was Tu Feng or Tang Yuxian, neither was someone who would go back on their words. While Yang Kai felt somewhat displeased, he still wished to hear what they would say.

Why did they appear so strained, avoiding his gaze?

“Kai’er.” Fourth Master Yang called out softly, trying to mediate, “It’s not what you think; don’t misunderstand.”

Dong Suzhu quickly added, “Yes, son, don’t speak like that. Yuxian and I have a private friendship and often discuss martial skills together. I know that she was the one who brought you back; your mother is delighted.”

Seeing that Yang Kai was showing signs of anger, Dong Suzhu felt a jolt of panic. She had never seen that expression on Yang Kai before; the earlier Yang Kai was incredibly well-behaved, in stark contrast to him now.

Witnessing this expression, Dong Suzhu's heart was filled with dread and pride; she realized her son had truly grown up and developed his own views and thoughts. She felt both sorrowful and happy.

With the two elders speaking on their behalf, Yang Kai's demeanor softened slightly. Taking a deep breath, he said, “If I misunderstood, I would only drive people away without saying anything.”

After hesitating for a moment, he added, “However, you must give me an explanation.”

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian exchanged wry, bitter smiles before slowly rising to half-kneel on the ground. Their expressions were filled with shame as they spoke solemnly, “It is not that we do not wish to serve the Young Master. If we could, we would gladly brave fire and tread through boiling water for the Young Master!”

Their voices were resolute, ringing with determination, stirring a tumultuous wave in Yang Yingfeng's heart!

Tu Feng actually referred to himself as a subordinate before his own son!

And Tang Yuxian did not refute!

The Blood Servants Hall is a unique entity within the Yang Family; Blood Servants mean not only status but also honor and loyalty. However, their loyalty is to the entire Yang Family, not to a specific individual.

Many years ago, two Blood Servants had welcomed him back to the family, but their attitudes towards him had been indifferent; all the way home, they merely followed their duties.

Even now, Fourth Master Yang had never received such respect from any Blood Servant.

But what he could not achieve, his son had accomplished; how could Yang Yingfeng not be shocked?

On the other hand, Yang Kai seemed indifferent, his expression devoid of any signs of honor or disgrace, acting rather ordinarily. In that moment, Fourth Master Yang could not help but feel a sense of defeat, wondering why he was not as good as his son, yet felt somewhat happy and comforted.

No wonder Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian had rushed to his estate; originally, Yang Yingfeng had been somewhat puzzled, but now it seemed there was a reason behind their hurried appearance.

“Then what is the reason that prevents you from being loyal to me?” Yang Kai asked with a cold expression.

“It is not that we cannot,” Tu Feng replied, his expression tormented and shamefaced.

Tang Yuxian promptly took over, “It’s just that before this, we have a matter to request of the Young Master!”

“Speak up,” Yang Kai frowned, suddenly realizing that whatever Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were struggling with must relate to something they required from him.

This thought filled Yang Kai with relief; these two were indeed not ungrateful people. It was his earlier impatient behavior that had been too rash.

But it was also related to his expectations of them.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian slowly rose, both looking rather awkward, with Tang Yuxian's delicate little face turning entirely red.

“This matter should not trouble the Young Master, but we have no choice but to come and ask shamelessly. We hope the Young Master will not take it to heart,” Tu Feng sighed deeply.

“What is it exactly?”

“This matter has just been discussed with Fourth Master. I currently lack the eloquence to explain, so I will let Fourth Master speak,” Tu Feng said, sitting back down gloomily.

Yang Kai shifted his gaze to Yang Yingfeng, who took a sip from his teacup before speaking, “Kai’er, do you know how many brothers have returned to Zhongdu now?”

Suddenly posing such a question, Yang Kai was somewhat perplexed but didn't rush to respond, simply nodding, “I have a rough idea.”

“Do you know about your Fourth Brother Yang Xinwu's situation?”

Yang Kai thought for a moment, recalling what Yang Zhao had said in that inn last time, and nodded, “I’ve heard of it.” 

Yang Yingfeng was slightly surprised, not expecting Yang Kai to seem oblivious to everything but still be quite well-informed. Knowing he himself had been gathering intelligence nonetheless, he felt a bit gratified.
