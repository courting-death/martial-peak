## Chapter 2551 — Ten Thousand Ghosts Devour the Body

At the height of his triumph, Yin Lesheng burst into wild laughter. “Yang Kai, did you ever imagine you’d see a day like this?”

How could he not be pleased? An expert proficient in space powers, able to tear open space at will, was now trapped here by his own hand. The joy in his heart was simply indescribable.

So even though he knew this wasn’t the time to exchange words with Yang Kai, Yin Lesheng couldn’t help but shout provocatively.

Hua Feichen said nothing, relentlessly seeking opportunities to launch fierce attacks.

Yang Kai blocked a strike, retreated, and raised the Myriad Sword defensively before his chest. He snorted coldly, “Frog at the bottom of a well, thinking the sky is only as wide as the well’s mouth. Today, I’ll let you trash see the truth and witness how I break your ridiculous formation.”

As he spoke, he flipped his hand, and suddenly a bracelet appeared. Though it was a woman’s ornament, it didn’t seem suitable for a woman to wear, as it was covered in intricate runes and pulsed with spiritual energy—clearly a formidable Imperial Treasure.

“Still so arrogant?” Yin Lesheng, enraged, used the cover of the Heaven Net Sealing Formation to sneak up on Yang Kai. Just as he was about to launch a sneak attack, a strange buzzing suddenly sounded in his ear.

The sound was bizarre, like countless flies and mosquitoes swarming in.

“What is that?”

Yin Lesheng frowned. Fearing a trick, he dared not act and instead retreated a little.

“Something that’ll take your dog lives,” Yang Kai sneered, waving his hand. Countless pitch-black insects poured out from the bracelet.

The bracelet was, of course, the Slave-Insect Bracelet, and those black insects were the evolved Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms.

Back in that cave, when he was besieged by countless Yin-Soul ghosts, Yang Kai suddenly wondered if his Soul-Devouring Worms might restrain these Yin-Souls.

After all, Soul-Devouring Worms specialized in devouring Divine Soul power, and they could even consume Demonic Qi.

From a certain perspective, those Yin-Soul ghosts were also condensed Divine Soul energy.

But with so many people around then, Yang Kai couldn’t just release the Soul-Devouring Worms for a test.

Only just now did he quietly release a few Soul-Devouring Worms, maneuvering between Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen while waiting for the result.

As expected, things turned out just as he’d hoped. Those Yin-Soul ghosts were a feast for the Soul-Devouring Worms, who not only devoured the ghosts but also the black mist here.

They seemed to greatly enjoy this energy.

Now that the test was done, Yang Kai had no reason to be polite with these Netherworld Sect people. With the Slave-Insect Bracelet unleashed, countless Soul-Devouring Demonic Worms flew out, scattering in all directions like hungry wolves among sheep, latching onto every drifting Yin-Soul ghost they could find.

In an instant, shrill, miserable wails rang out. Though the Yin-Souls had lost their minds from life, they still screamed in agony as they were bitten, making one’s skin crawl.

Yin Lesheng and Hua Feichen were both startled, not knowing what was happening—only that their side seemed to be suffering heavy losses.

With the situation unclear, they dared not attack rashly, fearing they’d fall into Yang Kai’s trap.

“What’s going on?” Hua Feichen, helpless, could only shout at the twenty-some disciples maintaining the formation.

Only they truly understood what was happening inside the formation. After all, they set it up, and its foundation was their Secret Treasures—their lives were tied to the formation’s fate.

“E-Elder Hua, something’s wrong!” a disciple cried in terror. “That man suddenly released a swarm of bugs!”

“A swarm of bugs?” Hua Feichen’s eyes bulged in fury. “What’s so scary about a few bugs? Destroy them!”

Useless fools! Even Emperor Realm experts could be killed inside the Heaven Net Sealing Formation, and they’re afraid of some bugs? How did the sect end up with such worthless disciples these days?

The disciple stammered in fear, “Elder, these bugs can’t be killed—they’re devouring the banner souls!”

“What?”

This time, Hua Feichen was truly shocked. The Yin-Soul ghosts filling the black sphere were the banner souls of the Netherworld Infernal Banner, without physical form. Just like the Yin-Souls in the Ancient Land’s passage, they were the condensed resentment from the dead—cold, sinister, and not to be trifled with.

There were actually bugs in this world that could devour banner souls?

What kind of bugs were these?

Before Hua Feichen could ask further, a chill suddenly swept toward him, aiming straight for his face.

Hua Feichen was shocked and roared, “You dare sneak attack, brat?!”

The chill was clearly Yang Kai’s doing. As Hua Feichen roared, he hastily raised his defenses. Explosions thundered out; his eyes nearly split with fury as he staggered backward, shock written across his face.

This was his first true head-on clash with Yang Kai. All their previous exchanges had been sneak attacks using the formation’s power, so he’d never expected Yang Kai’s strength to be so overwhelming.

Even with the formation’s suppression, he—a Second Stage Emperor Realm—was forced back by a lower-stage opponent.

Was this kid even human? Hua Feichen felt a sense of unreality, as if in a dream.

Yang Kai laughed loudly. “You ambush me, but I can’t ambush you? What’s so strange about a sneak attack, Elder Hua? Or do you think I should just stick my neck out and wait for you to chop my head off?”

Hua Feichen’s mouth twitched, but he couldn’t help but snort, “That would be best.”

Yang Kai chuckled. “Then let’s see if you have what it takes.”

As he spoke, his figure flashed, and somehow he precisely located Hua Feichen’s position. His attack came crashing down with world-shattering force.

Hua Feichen, terrified, shouted, “Junior Nephew, help me!”

A Second Stage Emperor Realm expert, forced to call for help from a Junior Nephew against a lower-stage opponent in his own formation—he’d lost all face.

But compared to his life, what did face matter?

Naturally, Yin Lesheng wouldn’t let Hua Feichen face danger alone. Hearing the call, he rushed over, shouting, “Yang Kai, don’t get cocky!”

The two joined forces instantly. Emperor Yuan surged as the Netherworld Sect’s secret arts burst forth dazzlingly, tangling with Yang Kai in a fierce melee.

Explosions rang out, violent energy waves spreading in all directions.

Floating in midair, Elder Fu and Lin’er both wore strange expressions.

Elder Fu frowned. “What are the Netherworld Sect people up to?”

“A bunch of useless trash,” Lin’er cursed through gritted teeth.

She’d even brought out the Taiyi Jade Cinnamon Bowl, an Imperial Treasure, to help, yet the Netherworld Sect still couldn’t take down Yang Kai. She couldn’t help but look down on them.

“Miss, should I go help?” Elder Fu asked respectfully.

Judging by the chaos inside, Hua Feichen and Yin Lesheng probably wouldn’t win anytime soon. Elder Fu was at least a First Stage Emperor Realm—if he joined, he could surely suppress Yang Kai’s arrogance.

“No need,” Lin’er refused flatly. “I’ve already given them enough face by helping personally. Why should you join? If they can’t even win like this, the Netherworld Sect is truly useless.”

Elder Fu dared not disobey and could only bow in assent.

Just then, a chorus of shocked cries erupted.

Elder Fu’s eyes narrowed. Following the sound, he saw the twenty-some Netherworld Sect disciples maintaining the formation all convulsing as if struck by lightning. Their faces were pale as paper, sweat poured down their foreheads, and even blood trickled from the corners of their mouths.

They seemed to have suffered some grievous blow.

“What’s happening?” Elder Fu stared wide-eyed, unable to make sense of it no matter how he looked.

A Netherworld Sect disciple cried out, “Elder, save me! My banner souls are almost completely devoured!”

Netherworld Sect disciples’ lives were tied to their Netherworld Infernal Banners. With a ghost banner in hand, their strength soared, but if the banner was damaged, they’d suffer terrible backlash.

They were only maintaining the formation, not fighting Yang Kai directly.

But the Soul-Devouring Worms Yang Kai released were constantly devouring their banner souls at a terrifying speed.

This disciple was especially unlucky—his banner soul was completely devoured by the Soul-Devouring Worms, causing his Netherworld Infernal Banner to be severely damaged and himself to suffer immense backlash.

Before he finished speaking, a black light suddenly shot out from the massive black sphere.

It was his life-bound Netherworld Infernal Banner.

But the moment he saw his Secret Treasure, instead of joy, he looked utterly terrified. He scrambled to his feet and fled.

The flying Netherworld Infernal Banner seemed to have a will of its own, chasing after him relentlessly.

In the blink of an eye, the banner caught up to the Netherworld Sect disciple.

With a bang…

The Netherworld Infernal Banner exploded, turning into a mass of pitch-black energy that enveloped the disciple.

“Ah…”

A scream rang out, shrill to the extreme, as if he were suffering the world’s most terrifying torture.

The black energy clung to him like black fire, refusing to disperse, and like venomous snakes, it slithered into his flesh through every pore.

As he screamed, the disciple rolled on the ground, clawing at his face.

He scratched so hard that he tore off his own flesh. In the blink of an eye, he was a bloody, skeletal mess.

“How… how could this be… what’s happening to him…”

Nearby, the red-clad girl wielding the Taiyi Jade Cinnamon Bowl turned pale, her voice trembling as she asked.

She had never witnessed such a horrifying scene.

No one would ever inflict such torment upon themselves unless the pain was truly unbearable.

“Ten Thousand Ghosts Devour the Body,” Elder Fu swallowed hard, still shaken. “He’s finished.”

With the Netherworld Infernal Banner’s power ruined, the disciple suffered backlash even worse than being thrown into a boiling cauldron.

As he spoke, the black energy on the disciple’s body suddenly contracted and burrowed into him. Even more agonized screams followed as he rolled on the ground, tearing off chunks of flesh. Blood quickly stained the earth red.
