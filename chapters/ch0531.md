## Chapter 531 — No Talk of Feelings

Unless Yang Kai found a place far from War City to ascend in secret, avoiding their watchful eyes.

Now that matters had developed to this stage, Yang Kai was unsure whether the Succession War would be affected. It wasn’t impossible that because of this, the family might strip him of his qualification to participate.

Qiu Yimeng was precisely concerned about this and had pulled Yang Kai aside to quietly discuss the matter behind closed doors.

But no matter how much they worried now, it was useless. The family’s decisions were not something Yang Kai could interfere with—just like the previous issue with the Blood Servants; if the family said they couldn’t participate, then they wouldn’t, no matter how much Yang Kai resisted or argued, in the end he had to compromise.

Although he had gained quite a few benefits at the time, the way things were unfolding differently from his expectations was truly aggravating.

Discussing with Qiu Yimeng yielded no results; the best they could do was stay alert early on.

“Anything else? If not, I’ll take my leave,” Yang Kai said hastily as he stood up.

Qiu Yimeng gazed at him blankly for a moment, then suddenly snorted and curled her lips disdainfully, “In such a hurry to find that cold and elegant woman?”

Her words dripping with sourness.

Yang Kai ignored her and strode towards the door.

“Take care of yourself. Don’t overwork!” Miss Qiu said with a mocking tone, face full of fake concern.

“So caring?” Yang Kai smirked mischievously and stopped in his tracks, burning gaze fixed on Qiu Yimeng, tilting his head. “You haven’t actually fallen for me, have you?”

Qiu Yimeng’s face flushed red. She snorted, “So what if I have?”

Yang Kai was stunned, not expecting her to admit it so straightforwardly, suddenly at a loss. Although he had often teased her verbally to keep her in check, it was all mere banter, meant to suppress her spirit, but now, faced with such an answer, unease gnawed at him.

He lingered there, not knowing what to say.

Qiu Yimeng, on the other hand, wore an indifferent expression and snorted softly, “Liking you doesn’t mean I want to be with you. Unless you can marry into the Qiu Family, only then could I give up everything and follow behind you, quietly becoming a virtuous wife and good mother. Can you become a son-in-law to the Qiu Family?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

“That’s right. So for us, it will only ever be to the extent that I like you. In the future, I will marry a young master of Zhongdu, and the Qiu Family will form a marriage alliance with his family, watching over and supporting each other, joining forces to overthrow your Yang Family, crushing you underfoot... Then, maybe we’ll become enemies.” Qiu Yimeng’s face remained composed, as if she were speaking about someone else. “Maybe I’ll marry someone like Huo Xingchen, or Gao Rangfeng, Kang Zhan, Liu Qingyao, Meng Shanyi. Any of them are possible.”

“They don’t deserve you,” Yang Kai said, shaking his head, suddenly finding the topic somewhat dull.

Qiu Yimeng giggled softly, tears glinting at the corners of her eyes. She didn’t wipe them away but turned her head quietly and said in a soft voice, “Whether they deserve me or not, I don’t deserve you either, do I? You are so strong, with a bright future, capable and charming, but also so domineering. There are almost no women worthy of you. I used to look down on the men of the world, but now, I can only look up to you...”

Yang Kai suddenly felt he couldn’t continue this conversation. If it went any further, this strong and wise woman would likely burst into tears.

He smiled crookedly, “No talk of feelings, alright? We can just fool around.”

Those words made him feel like the scum of the earth himself.

“Not now. When the day comes for me to marry, I’ll come find you!” Qiu Yimeng said seriously, shaking her head.

Yang Kai stared at her in astonishment. “You’re joking, right?”

Qiu Yimeng smiled slyly, coquettish, “What do you think?”

“I’m leaving first,” Yang Kai said, breaking into a cold sweat and rushing out in a panic.

In the corridor came crisp sounds as moonlight shone upon a graceful figure reclining against the railing, gazing up at the starry sky, holding some hazelnuts she’d apparently found somewhere, crunching them soundly.

Her light blue hair caught Yang Kai’s eyes, making him momentarily distracted. That clear, yet slightly alluring face was captivating, red lips parting to reveal white, pristine teeth, while two long legs—half exposed to the cool air—boasted skin as white and smooth as jade, dazzling the eyes.

Yang Kai furrowed his brows, staring at the woman before him.

“Want some?” Shui Ling held out her hand, still crunching hazelnuts with practiced ease.

“No, thanks.” Yang Kai shook his head. “What are you doing here?”

“I live next door,” Shui Ling said, pointing to the room beside hers. “It’s boring at night, so I came out to look at the stars.”

“I asked how you got into my manor!” Yang Kai scoffed.

“What’s the big deal? Your manor’s so big, what harm is there in me staying here for a bit?” Shui Ling pouted and whispered, “You can’t be that stingy.”

“Cut the tricks. It’s fine you stay here, but if I find out you have any schemes, you’re done for.”

“Ahh, I’m so scared,” Shui Ling bit her thin lips, looking at Yang Kai with feigned terror, her large eyes full of mock dread.

“Hmph!” Knowing she was putting on an act, Yang Kai did not probe further and after a moment’s pondering asked, “Did you hear what I just said?”

Shui Ling continued crunching hazelnuts, giggling, “I didn’t catch the first half, but the second half I heard loud and clear.”

“Go keep her company!”

The hazelnuts in Shui Ling’s mouth silently slipped down as she exclaimed, “You’re serious?”

“Either keep her company, or get lost now.”

“You…” Shui Ling ground her teeth, quickly hopping down, stuffing the hazelnuts into her bosom. She puffed out her chest, glared fiercely at Yang Kai, and said through gritted teeth, “I’ll remember this!”

Having said that, she stormed into Qiu Yimeng’s room.

After a moment, the sound of two young girls chatting drifted out, and only then did Yang Kai leave satisfied.

Shui Ling had arrived at the manor three days ago with the others. Yang Kai knew this but had paid her no mind. This woman’s origins were mysterious, her cultivation level inconsistent with her age, and that unique pale blue hair—none of it seemed like that of an ordinary woman.

She claimed to hail from the Water Divine Hall, a sect Yang Kai had never heard of.

As he kept the Earth Demons on alert for her movements, Yang Kai harbored no other intent but to uncover her secrets.

He could feel that Shui Ling currently bore no ill will towards the people in the manor, so he tacitly allowed her to stay here.

He hadn’t expected Qiu Yimeng to assign her the room right next door, clearly to keep an eye on him.

The moon was bright and the stars sparse, the night wind seductive.

Yang Kai arrived at his Junior Sister’s room.

Su Yan was also present.

It was late, and both young maidens were a bit shy suddenly seeing Yang Kai arrive. Su Yan was somewhat composed, but Xia Ningshang’s face was flush red up to her neck.

During Su Yan’s absence, Xia Ningshang had often shared a bed with Yang Kai in the dormitory, though nothing improper had ever happened. Still, now she felt embarrassed to even face him.

Bowing her head, she remained silent.

Su Yan glanced playfully at Yang Kai and softly asked, “Why are you here?”

“I’ve been living here all along,” Yang Kai replied plainly.

Su Yan suddenly understood, pursing her lips with a light smile.

She did not oppose Yang Kai’s arrangement with Xia Ningshang. In fact, when it came to relationships, she had never imposed restrictions or demands on him.

If it weren’t for the influence of the Dual Cultivation Technique, Su Yan’s cold temperament would never have felt the need for that aspect. Instead, it was Yang Kai, cultivating a vigorous and masculine path, whose demands were naturally more intense.

Yang Kai’s status was not low; he could have as many women as he wished, especially now that the manor was full of beauties who favored him.

But as far as Su Yan knew, Yang Kai had only ever been with her.

For such a man, Su Yan would never seek to control him.

“Are you going to rest?” Su Yan smiled, looking at him.

“Dual cultivation, last time we didn’t do it,” Yang Kai said.

“Oh,” Su Yan’s face flushed as she recalled.

“I’m resting now!” Xia Ningshang suddenly said, collapsing onto the bed and covering her face with the quilt, motionless, as if she instantly fell asleep.

Yang Kai and Su Yan glanced at each other and both smiled, remembering how Xia Ningshang often behaved this way back in the cave dwelling beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine in Lingxiao Pavilion.

Shaking his head, Yang Kai said nothing further. The two sat cross-legged facing each other, pressing their palms together.

The Dual Cultivation Technique had already reached the Second-Tier and no longer required physical contact to practice.

Their True Yuan merged in a flash, flowing from Yang Kai’s body to Su Yan’s, then back again—endlessly cycling and sustaining.

A few days ago, a fierce battle had set the entire War City ablaze, a fire that had yet to fully subside.

Yang Family’s Ninth Brother, Yang Kai, suddenly displayed overwhelming depth and advantage, killing Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng in front of Yang Zhao’s mansion, acting wildly and arrogantly, blatantly ascending to the Divine Roaming Realm.

The malevolent energy spread throughout War City, ultimately drawing eight powerful figures from Fengshen Hall to intervene. But facing Yang Kai’s unfathomable connections and the forces he gathered, even all eight had to concede.

Afterward, Yang Kai successfully broke through to the Divine Roaming Realm, and the eight from Fengshen Hall retreated.

Yang Zhao’s mansion lay in ruins.

The next day, Yang Wei, the First Brother, announced that until the Succession War concluded, he would take no further action.

This information caused an uproar in War City.

Yang Wei’s intentions were clear: he believed he could not win the Succession War, so he chose a passive approach. However, everyone understood and held no blame or disdain.

In the face of Yang Kai’s utterly overwhelming power, even Yang Wei’s resistance was futile.

If Yang Kai wished, he could easily take down Yang Wei and remove him from the game in an instant.
