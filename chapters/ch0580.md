## Chapter 580 — Kill Them

Among the ranks of the Eight Great Families, two Transcendent Realm powerhouses glared with bloodshot eyes, their gaze full of hatred and fear, fixating tightly on the crowd within Yang Kai’s estate.

They were Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe.

Over ten days ago, the two had fled in panic to Zhongdu and reported their experiences to the Eight Great Families. However, to their disappointment, the members of the Eight Great Families didn’t believe a word of what they said.

The Eight Great Families knew exactly how many martial experts Yang Kai’s estate held, and what levels they were at. Even though their intelligence was from six months ago, it was impossible that, as Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe claimed, nine blood servants of the Transcendent Realm had suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

That was too unrealistic.

Though Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe swore solemnly and repeatedly insisted their words were true, the Eight Great Families refused to trust them, dismissing their words as mere excuses to prevent their elite from rushing to reinforce Zhongdu.

For this reason, Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe suffered constant suspicion. Not only were they not trusted by the Eight Great Families, but even other first-rate forces coming to assist Zhongdu shunned them.

This debt had now been squarely placed on Yang Kai’s head.

If Yang Kai had not been ruthless, ordering the killing of their families’ elites, how could they have ended up in such a dire state?

Although furious, the two remained clear-headed enough to know that, given their strength, they had no means to confront Yang Kai’s estate.

They exchanged meaningful looks and then smiled darkly, quietly making their way over to two other Transcendent Realm powerhouses.

Like Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe, these two also stared at Yang Kai with intense hatred and murderous intent, as if they bore irreconcilable enmity toward him.

“Brother Xiang, Brother Nan, that kid is the murderer of your families’ heirs. Now that enemies meet, don’t you have any thoughts?” Huang Xiao sneered sarcastically.

Xiang Ning detected the bait hidden in his words and snorted coldly. “The grudge between the Xiang and Nan families and Yang Kai is irreconcilable. If I get the chance, I will naturally take his life. No need for Brother Huang to trouble himself.”

The Xiang and Nan families, as first-rate noble lineages, had naturally responded to the call of the Eight Great Families and arrived in Zhongdu to reinforce it. They were one of the few major forces already present.

After days of fighting, both families had suffered heavy losses. Xiang Ning, the head of the Xiang family, and Nan Xilou, head of the Nan family, were in low spirits. They wanted to retreat from Zhongdu but lacked the courage. Now, upon seeing the very murderer of Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng, the two family heads burned with fury.

Nan Xilou glanced toward the Eight Great Families and said grimly, “I wonder what attitude they hold toward Yang Kai over there.”

Huang Xiao sneered, “Yang Kai and the Eight Great Families have long since fallen out. That’s common knowledge. What is there to worry about?”

Jiang Zhe laughed coldly, “The enemy is before our eyes. Are you two still going to swallow your grievances in silence?”

Xiang Ning and Nan Xilou snorted coldly. Although they wished to personally kill Yang Kai to avenge Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng, they were not fools and could clearly see that the Heavenly Journey Palace encasing Yang Kai’s estate was no trivial matter.

That light curtain, like a barrier, was likely impossible to break with their strength.

Without breaking the barrier, revenge was impossible.

Just as they hesitated, Yang Kai suddenly moved.

He strode out of the barrier boldly and carelessly, followed closely by thirteen blood servants, the Earth Demon, Li Yuanchun, Lü Si, and others, along with countless Divine Roaming Realm experts stepping forward.

This move shocked everyone present.

No one expected Yang Kai to be so audacious as to directly enter this chaotic battlefield.

Scanning the surroundings, Yang Kai gave a brief order, “Kill!”

At that command, those Divine Roaming Realm experts immediately pounced upon the stunned warriors of the Cangyun Evil Land. In an instant, the stalemate shattered.

There were no fewer than four or five hundred Divine Roaming Realm experts from Yang Kai’s estate, charging forward like fierce tigers descending the mountain. The exhausted Cangyun Evil Land warriors had no strength to resist and were routed at a mere glance, retreating in disarray.

Cries of pain rang out, blood splattered.

Yang Kai felt the Golden Pupil Eye in his Sea of Consciousness stir with a mysterious attraction once again, absorbing the Divine Sense energy of the fallen Divine Roaming Realm warriors.

Refreshed and invigorated, Yang Kai stood quietly, delighting in the absorption process.

The blood servants remained still, guarding Yang Kai carefully to prevent harm from any Transcendent Realm experts from Cangyun Evil Land.

Witnessing this, the family heads of the Eight Great Families exchanged strange glances. They had never expected Yang Kai to take the initiative to attack, let alone ruthlessly strike at the Cangyun Evil Land forces!

“Battle commenced!” Yang Yinghao, invigorated, shouted loudly, “Support Yang Kai! Devour these demonic villains!”

At his command, the Divine Roaming Realm experts among the Eight Great Families and the reinforcements from the major forces all surged forward with overwhelming momentum, taking advantage of the chaos caused by the warriors from Yang Kai’s estate.

“Here’s our chance, Brother Xiang, Brother Nan. Let’s see if you can seize it well,” Huang Xiao chuckled meaningfully.

Xiang Ning and Nan Xilou exchanged a glance; though tinged with worry and caution, the burning desire for vengeance for their slain children nearly destroyed their reason.

After a long moment, their expressions steeled, and they vanished with a flash.

The elites of the Xiang and Nan families charged forward alongside their family heads.

Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe remained quietly, grinning maliciously, faces filled with smug satisfaction and schadenfreude. They knew Xiang Ning and Nan Xilou had been swayed by their words and were about to taste the overwhelming strength of Yang Kai’s estate.

For more than ten days, Xiang Ning and Nan Xilou had consistently suppressed them, filling them with resentment; now, that anger was finally about to be vented.

Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe felt utterly relieved.

Suddenly, a furious roar thundered into Yang Kai’s ear.

Still absorbing the Divine Sense energy of the fallen, Yang Kai looked up to see two Transcendent Realm powerhouses hurtling toward him with murderous intent.

He frowned, wondering where he had earned their enmity.

His expression remained unchanged, even his body unmoved, as he gazed coldly at them.

Sensing the mockery in Yang Kai’s eyes, Xiang Ning and Nan Xilou abandoned their last shred of hesitation. Their sole thought was to kill Yang Kai and avenge Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng.

Tu Feng and others quietly waited, watching Xiang Ning and Nan Xilou as they rushed closer. When the two came within range, a sudden surge of ferocious True Yuan burst forth.

Feeling the tremendous killing power in the True Yuan attack ahead, Xiang Ning and Nan Xilou’s eyes almost popped from their sockets.

It was power no weaker than their own, perhaps even stronger.

In a blur, the two were flipped dozens of times in midair, pinned to the ground by Tu Feng, Ying Jiu, and others, utterly immobilized.

Eyeballs popped all around.

The family heads of the Eight Great Families gaped in shock. When the blood servants had remained still, they hadn’t realized just how strong they were. But once they acted, the family heads were horrified to see these individuals were no longer mere Divine Roaming Realm experts but truly beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

“Just as expected!” Feng Sheng, the head of the Blood Servants Hall, beamed with joy and laughed heartily.

Although he had his suspicions, when faced with the truth, Feng Sheng could barely believe it. More than shock, he was thrilled that their brothers and sisters had advanced even further, rising to new heights.

While joyous, Feng Sheng also held a faint envy toward them.

“Family heads of the Xiang and Nan families, what is the meaning of this?” Lü Si asked in alarm.

“Family heads of the Xiang and Nan families?” Upon hearing their titles, Yang Kai instantly understood why these two bore such hostility toward him.

Xiang Ning and Nan Xilou’s faces turned pale as death. Though pinned to the ground and thoroughly humiliated, they stubbornly lifted their heads, staring at Yang Kai with horrified fury.

“Young Master, what shall we do with these two?” Tu Feng inquired.

“Kill them.” Yang Kai’s eyes gleamed with icy coldness. Before knowing who they were, he had held back his murderous intent, but upon discovering their identities, he saw no need to spare their lives.

Xiang Ning and Nan Xilou were utterly incredulous. They never expected that, given their prestigious status, this Young Master of the Yang family would dare give such an order.

Xiang Ning roared, “Yang Kai, always leave a way out, so we may meet again in the future!”

Yang Kai laughed bitterly, “I need not leave a way out, for we shall never meet again, and the Xiang and Nan families will cease to exist in this world!”

Their faces turned deathly pale.

Tu Feng and Ying Jiu wasted no hesitation, releasing fierce True Yuan bursts that instantly ended the lives of the two first-rate family heads of the Transcendent Realm.

Two distinct streams of Divine Sense energy, different from earlier, were drawn into Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness by the Golden Pupil Eye. Feeling their vast power, Yang Kai’s expression brightened.

Raising his eyes, from over a hundred zhang away, Yang Kai coldly stared at the triumphant Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe, waving his hand, “Kill those two as well!”

Last time, when he was probing the secret of the Golden Pupil Eye, these two had escaped, much to Yang Kai’s regret. Now, meeting them again, how could he let them live?

Five blood servants sprang into action. Before Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe could react, they found themselves surrounded and overwhelmed. In less than a dozen breaths, both lay dead.

Though the blood servants had only recently ascended to the Transcendent Realm, with the tutor Meng Wuya’s guidance, their power surpassed many ordinary Transcendent Realm experts.

Five against two—how could Huang Xiao and Jiang Zhe stand a chance?

After their deaths, Yang Kai frowned slightly and stepped forward. When he reached within twenty zhang, he sensed two great energies rushing into his Sea of Consciousness.

Twenty zhang—this should be the maximum effective range of the Golden Pupil Eye’s absorption ability.

Unintentionally, Yang Kai had glimpsed this secret.

“Bastard!” Ye Kuangren roared angrily. The other family heads of the Eight Great Families were also stunned.

They had assumed Yang Kai came to Zhongdu to join forces with the Eight Great Families against the invasion of Cangyun Evil Land. Yet unexpectedly, he had mercilessly slain even the reinforcements.
