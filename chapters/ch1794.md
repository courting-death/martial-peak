## Chapter 1794 — Power of the Law

The clash between Zi Long and Ni Guang erupted in an instant.

Xu Wei and Kong Fa looked up at the terrifying spectacle in the sky, their gazes trembling slightly as they felt the depth of their own powerlessness.

As cultivators of the Void King Realm, they were men of high pride, yet they were only of the First Stage; now, seeing masters of the Second Stage unleash their full might, they immediately understood the gulf between themselves and those opponents.

If Ni Guang and Zi Long were so formidable, what of the Ghost Ancestor who stood at their same level?

The two of them shared a mutual unease and turned their eyes to the Ghost Ancestor.

The Ghost Ancestor had no intention of attacking them; instead he stood guard beside Yang Kai, utterly still. He understood priorities — protecting Yang Kai’s safety was what mattered now. He had no leisure to bother with Xu Wei and Kong Fa; as long as those two did not act, the Ghost Ancestor would not create trouble for them.

What the Ghost Ancestor did not expect was that Xu Wei’s life and death were no longer under his control, but were gripped by Zi Donglai.

Seeing his father already locked in a brutal fight with Ni Guang, Zi Donglai naturally did not want his father to battle alone; he immediately sent a thought-command to Xu Wei, ordering him to go and intercept the Ghost Ancestor.

Xu Wei’s face contorted with rage as he cursed Zi Donglai in his heart.

But with his soul mark controlled by Zi Donglai and lacking any courage to resist, he could only turn his hopes to an old friend. He steadied himself and quietly transmitted to Kong Fa, “Brother Kong, an opportunity has come.”

Kong Fa frowned. “Brother Xu, the opportunity you mean… you don’t mean to try to attack that brat now, do you?”

“That is exactly what I’m thinking.”

“Have you lost your mind? The old man by that brat looks hard to provoke — even the two of us together might not be his match.” Kong Fa was taken aback.

“Brother Kong, fortune favors the bold! Since we reached the Void King Realm, have either of us ever broken through? Do you want to stay at the first Stage forever? The Everlasting Tree is a treasure so few can ever see — if we miss this chance, I will never be at ease. No matter how you think of it, I’m going to risk it. Even if I lose my life, so what?” Xu Wei argued earnestly, trying to drag Kong Fa into the scheme; alone, he dared not provoke the Ghost Ancestor.

Kong Fa’s expression turned grave as he appeared to ponder the matter.

Seeing a chance, Xu Wei hurried to press the point: “We don’t have to clash head-on with that old man. Ni Guang is being tied down by Zi Long. One of us only needs to distract the old man while the other strikes that brat — if we capture him, the old man will be cautious.”

“That may be, but…” Kong Fa was still somewhat timid.

“Brother Kong, I will go entangle the old man. You take care of that brat.” Xu Wei, having little else to lose, immediately took the riskiest task upon himself.

Kong Fa trembled, staring at Xu Wei in amazement, moved to say, “Brother Xu, you…”

In his memory, Xu Wei was not the sort to sacrifice himself, so this proposal surprised him greatly.

Xu Wei laughed heartily. “Just remember not to forget my efforts if you succeed!”

“Of course I won’t!” Kong Fa was finally persuaded. He said in a low voice, “Since you put it that way, if I do not agree I’d be ungenerous — it’s settled! If I really succeed, the Everlasting Tree will be split between us!”

Xu Wei was delighted, thinking he had at last pulled his old friend in; his words had not been in vain.

With their plan made, they no longer delayed; both circulated Saint Yuan and cast malicious glances toward Yang Kai.

“Heh heh heh…” The Ghost Ancestor chuckled strangely. “Finally could not be restrained? Fine — I’m bored sitting here; you two kids can keep me entertained.”

As the Ghost Ancestor’s words fell, the massive ghostly head that had hung in midair suddenly roared, opened its black maw, and lunged to bite at Kong Fa and Xu Wei.

The two were shocked. They quickly scattered, each using evasive measures while unleashing Secret Treasures and Secret Arts toward the ghost head.

The Ghost Ancestor remained unhurried. With a single finger he pointed, and the ghost head immediately split into two, causing their attacks to miss. The split halves then contorted and transformed back into two ghost heads, each giving chase to one of them.

Xu Wei and Kong Fa’s faces darkened as they realized they had underestimated the Ghost Ancestor. The pursuit by the ghost heads alone was not something easily shaken off, and approaching Yang Kai to attack was out of the question.

For a time, the place where the divine bird nested became a riot of activity; fierce battles unfolded above and below.

Under the protection of Xue Yue and the Ghost Ancestor, Yang Kai was safe as he guided his Incarnation to advance into the Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

Before long, the Incarnation arrived in front of the Everlasting Tree.

Through the Incarnation, Yang Kai observed the Everlasting Tree up close; the nearer he was, the more he felt the terrifying life force contained within it.

He had heard the legends of the Everlasting Tree before and knew it had supposedly vanished from history long ago. He had not expected to find one here in this Lost Realm.

This was a supreme treasure capable of granting an undying body — even more precious than the Warm Spirit Lotus — and it stood before him now.

Yang Kai’s heart stirred. After steadying himself, he controlled the Incarnation and attempted to uproot the Everlasting Tree.

The Stone Puppet Incarnation’s two palms clenched the tree’s root near its base and heaved upward.

To Yang Kai’s surprise, the Everlasting Tree did not budge. The sapling seemed rooted as if in iron-cast ground.

He applied a little more force...

Still nothing.

Yang Kai stubbornly added even more strength...

After three or five such attempts he could not help but be shocked.

Although the Stone Puppet Incarnation had not consumed many rare minerals and had not grown much, Stone Puppets were a species born with immense strength; under his control it could shake even a small mountain.

Yet the Everlasting Tree would not be pulled free.

Even more astonishing, under such force the Everlasting Tree bore no damage whatsoever.

An ordinary tree would have been snapped long ago.

It became clear that the reason Ni Guang and Zi Long’s two puppets had failed to claim the Everlasting Tree was not mutual interference, but that those puppets simply lacked the power.

Even if they had joined forces back then, they still wouldn’t have been able to obtain the Everlasting Tree!

“Not enough strength?” Yang Kai muttered; a gleam flashed in his eyes. In the next instant he waved his hand and the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao made a brilliant appearance!

One Stone Puppet lacked power; surely two would suffice, right?

Besides, Xiaoxiao had devoured countless rare minerals and in strength exceeded the Incarnation by many times.

As soon as Xiaoxiao appeared, it received Yang Kai’s command and immediately strode toward the Everlasting Tree with astonishing speed.

The next moment it charged into the Seven Luminaries Divine Light!

The light’s suppressive force pressed from all sides, yet Xiaoxiao’s exterior suddenly radiated an indescribable, supremely profound fluctuation that neutralized that suppression.

Xiaoxiao only hesitated briefly, then advanced unimpeded through the Seven Luminaries Divine Light as if walking on level ground.

“This is... the Power of the Law?” Yang Kai cried out in astonishment. Although his Soul Incarnation controlled the Incarnation and he was not affected, he still perceived the change in Xiaoxiao clearly.

The force that surged from Xiaoxiao bore unmistakable traces of the Heavenly Laws.

As the Star Lord of the Dark Star, he could sense the Dark Star’s law; the law force on Xiaoxiao, though extremely slight, was undeniably genuine.

When had Xiaoxiao comprehended such a power? Yang Kai frowned. Stone Puppets were of low wit and could not achieve true Enlightenment on their own, so this force had to have been formed by external influence.

When had that occurred?

Thoughts racing, Yang Kai suddenly realized.

Previously on that mineral star, Xiaoxiao had devoured the remaining Stellar Origin and then slept for a time. At the time Yang Kai had assumed Xiaoxiao would become much stronger when it awoke.

But later events showed it had not displayed much change, and Yang Kai had been a little disappointed.

Now it seemed not that Xiaoxiao had not changed, but that it had simply not shown the change.

After devouring that remnant Stellar Origin, it had indeed acquired a trace of law power; though faint, it was more than enough to withstand the Seven Luminaries Divine Light.

The Power of the Law — that was an exceedingly profound force.

While Yang Kai was lost in thought, Xiaoxiao had already reached the Incarnation’s side, stood opposite it, and reached out to grasp the Everlasting Tree.

The next instant, a deep roar issued from Xiaoxiao’s throat. Its small eyes widened as it seemed to exert every last ounce of strength.

Crack, crack...

From beneath the ground, vague sounds of something fracturing could be heard.

The once immovable Everlasting Tree was finally shaken by that unmatched force; the fragile sapling was being pulled free at a subtle speed, and the ground split with jagged fissures.

As the Everlasting Tree was uprooted, the Spiritual Qi of the surrounding world went into violent turmoil, triggering a startling chain reaction.

“This is…” The Ghost Ancestor, idly holding back Xu Wei and Kong Fa while concentrating on sensing the surroundings, turned solemn. He discovered that within the thousand-li range his Divine Sense could perceive, the life-energy in heaven and earth was stirring and frantically converging toward the Everlasting Tree; in mere moments the vitality in Medicine Valley had been greatly reduced.

In an environment like this, this place would likely never again sprout any treasures of real value.

“The Everlasting Tree is actually closely linked to the life-force of Medicine Valley!” the Ghost Ancestor realized, his eyes flashing with a keen light.

At that moment, from the far horizon a clear, ringing cry suddenly sounded, filled with furious wrath. The Ghost Ancestor looked up and his face changed drastically.
