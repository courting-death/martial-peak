## Chapter 2314 — How to Write the Word "Death"

In the main hall, more than a dozen Dao Origin Realm experts set up a formation, instantly restraining Yang Kai, Chi Yue, Chai Hu, and the other three in place.

Luo Jin laughed loudly, looking around with a proud expression, and called out, "Which friend here can help this Lord kill this brat? This Lord will be eternally grateful!"

He had no intention of acting himself—not because he feared Yang Kai's strength, but simply because he didn't want to. He wanted to use this method to save some face and solidify his own position.

Sure enough, as soon as he finished speaking, someone cupped his fists and volunteered, "Mu Zheng of White Cloud Tower is willing to lend the City Lord a hand."

Another person stepped forward, cupping his fists, "Guo Zhe of Heart Inquiry Pavilion awaits your command."

A third also stepped out, saying, "This villain is despicable and shameless, spreading lies and deceiving the crowd. I, Yuan Mo of Soul-Seizing Sword Sect, cannot stand by and watch. I am willing to take his head as a warning to others!"

In a rush, seven or eight people stood up, representing seven or eight forces, expressing their loyalty to Luo Jin in this way.

Luo Jin, who had been stifled for so long, finally felt much better. He smiled and nodded, "Good, then I'll trouble you all."

The group responded in unison, "Please rest assured, City Lord. We will not let you down."

As soon as they finished, these people turned around, grinning viciously as they looked at Yang Kai.

Although Yang Kai had performed remarkably before, at this moment he was bound by the formation set up by the City Lord’s mansion’s martial artists, unable to move at all. He was like a piece of fat meat on the chopping block, ready to be slaughtered however they pleased.

Suddenly, Mu Zheng of White Cloud Tower smiled, "Everyone, if word gets out that we are bullying the few with the many, it won't sound good. Besides, there are so many guests here. Even if we win, it won't be an honorable victory."

Guo Zhe said, "Then, Brother Mu, what do you suggest?"

The others also looked at him curiously, not knowing what he intended.

Mu Zheng smiled slightly. "My suggestion is that only one of us should act, while the rest stand by and support. How about that?"

Upon hearing this, everyone smiled knowingly, understanding his meaning, and immediately nodded in agreement, "Brother Mu is absolutely right."

Mu Zheng said, "Then... who should be the one to act?"

Yuan Mo of Soul-Seizing Sword Sect said, "Since Brother Mu suggested it, let Brother Mu do it."

The others had no objections. After all, they had already stepped forward at the critical moment to show their loyalty to the City Lord. As for who would kill Yang Kai, it no longer mattered. Dead is dead—whoever did it made no difference.

Mu Zheng, looking as if this was exactly what he wanted, nodded with a smile, "Since everyone agrees, then I shall not decline."

As he spoke, the corners of his mouth curled up in contempt. He glanced at Yang Kai with a look of certainty, then walked toward him unhurriedly.

"Yang Kai!" Chi Yue's face grew tense, desperately urging her Origin Qi, but no matter what she did, she couldn't break free from her restraints. Her beautiful face changed color in anxiety as she said, "If you can escape, go! Don't worry about me. As long as the green hills remain, there will always be firewood to burn."

Chai Hu also said, "That's right, Young Brother. Just remember to avenge us."

"Hahaha, you still think of escaping in this situation?" Mu Zheng laughed mockingly, looking at Chi Yue, "Madam, rest assured. I am always precise with my strikes—I won't accidentally hurt you."

Even at this moment, he didn't forget to curry favor with Luo Jin.

Luo Jin stood not far away. Hearing this, he nodded in satisfaction.

"Do you really think you have what it takes to kill me?" Yang Kai remained calm, smiling as Mu Zheng approached step by step.

That smile entered Mu Zheng's eyes, making his heart skip a beat. A sense of unease spread within him, causing him to panic. He gritted his teeth and shouted fiercely, "You're about to die and still act so arrogant! Watch how I take your dog life!"

With a loud shout, he suddenly summoned a broadsword. As Origin Qi surged, the blade shone brightly, shadows overlapping, and a dazzling display of colors exploded as he slashed down at Yang Kai.

Clearly, he didn't want to drag things out and aimed to finish it quickly, so he used his full strength from the start.

This strike enveloped both Yang Kai and Chai Hu, but excluded Chi Yue. It was obvious he had guessed Luo Jin's intentions—leave the new bride, kill the rest.

Seeing the blade light coming at him, Yang Kai's eyes flashed coldly. He said in a frosty voice, "A mere First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm dares to act so presumptuously before this Young Master!"

As soon as he finished, his figure flickered and he disappeared from where he stood, seemingly unaffected by the formation. Spatial power surged, and he appeared right in front of Mu Zheng, his fingers like a sword, Undying Five Elements Sword Qi swirling at his fingertips, slashing straight at the opponent.

"Ah!" Mu Zheng was shocked, his face turning deathly pale. He could hardly believe what he was seeing.

He was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. If he hadn't seen Yang Kai bound by the formation, given Yang Kai's previous ferocity, he wouldn't have dared to provoke a tiger.

But now, with the situation suddenly reversed and Yang Kai breaking free from the formation, he was scared out of his wits, trembling all over. The strike he unleashed with his Secret Treasure instantly lost all momentum.

As blade and sword clashed, a series of crisp clangs rang out. Mu Zheng was struck hard, sent flying, and vomited blood in midair.

Yang Kai shouted sternly, "Since you all don't know how to write the word 'death,' let this Young Master teach you!"

As he spoke, Undying Five Elements Sword Qi flickered on his finger, which moved like a dragon and a snake, tracing something in the air right in front of Mu Zheng's body.

Mu Zheng's miserable screams instantly echoed through the heavens, chilling everyone to the bone. No one knew what kind of torment he was suffering, but his cries were truly wretched.

All the guests around were silent with fear.

Meanwhile, Ye Qinghan, who was about to risk everything to save Yang Kai, was dumbfounded. She knew Yang Kai was extraordinary, but never imagined he was this monstrous.

The binding formation secretly set up by the City Lord was completely useless against him.

But then she remembered Yang Kai possessed Spatial Force, and felt relieved. With spatial abilities, even if Yang Kai couldn't win, he could escape easily—unless an Emperor Realm expert acted and suppressed him instantly, leaving him no chance to use his spatial power.

In a moment, Mu Zheng crashed heavily into the wall, spitting out blood mixed with fragments of his internal organs. He lay motionless, completely lifeless.

He was already dead.

Just then, Yang Kai snapped his fingers.

With a crisp sound, Mu Zheng's body exploded, turning into a mist of blood. Strangely, the blood didn't scatter but was imprinted onto the wall by a force, dyeing it bright red, as if someone had splashed a bucket of paint on it.

The stench of blood filled the air, making people nauseous.

Hiss—

The sound of people sucking in cold breaths rang out, followed by gulping. Everyone stared wide-eyed at Yang Kai in disbelief.

This sudden turn of events happened in a flash, dazzling everyone. Before most could react, Mu Zheng, who had charged at Yang Kai with murderous intent, was already dead.

What kind of terrifying strength was needed to achieve this?

"Come, come!" Yang Kai shouted, pointing at the blood-red wall. "All you illiterates, come and see how the word 'death' is written." He laughed coldly, "Don't say this Young Master never taught you. If you die with regrets, it won't be my fault."

Following his finger, everyone looked again, and their legs cramped in fear.

On the blood-red wall, a huge character for 'death' had appeared. Blood still dripped from the strokes, each drop echoing like a requiem, sending chills down everyone's spine. Bits of flesh and organ fragments clung to the wall between the strokes.

Recalling Yang Kai's earlier actions, everyone realized with horror that he had used his finger as a brush and Mu Zheng's body as ink to write that character on the wall.

This was open provocation, a blatant show of force.

Yet no one dared say a word about it.

Luo Jin's face was ashen. He had hoped to use others to kill and intimidate the guests, regaining some face, but instead ended up shooting himself in the foot, his face twitching in pain.

"Someone just called me despicable and shameless, spreading lies and deceiving the crowd!" Yang Kai suddenly flickered and appeared beside Yuan Mo of Soul-Seizing Sword Sect, hooking his arm around his shoulder like an old friend, smiling as he asked.

Yuan Mo hadn't even processed what was happening. Still in shock over Mu Zheng's death, he was already caught by Yang Kai. By the time he realized and tried to escape, it was too late.

The others, seeing this fiend approach, were all terrified, scrambling to get away, watching Yang Kai with dread, afraid he would target them next.

Judging by Yang Kai's earlier display, if he really wanted to kill them, they would have no power to resist.

Each of them was filled with deep regret, wishing they hadn't chosen sides so early and brought trouble upon themselves for nothing.

Yuan Mo was trembling all over, his calves shaking, face pale, stammering, "Young Master Yang... I, just now, spoke without thinking and offended you. Please, Young Master Yang, be magnanimous and don't hold it against me."

"Spoke without thinking?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows. "Then I'll give you time to think carefully. Tell me, who exactly is despicable and shameless, spreading lies and deceiving the crowd?"

Yuan Mo shuddered, lowered his head, and stammered, "It's me, it's me, all me. I'm the one who's despicable and shameless, spreading lies and deceiving the crowd!"

"Hmm?" Yang Kai snorted coldly, "Looks like you still don't know how to write the word 'death.' Do you want me to teach you again?"

Yuan Mo was about to cry. He fell to his knees, wailing, "It was the City Lord who was despicable and shameless, deceiving us! Young Master Yang, spare me! Please spare me!"

Even though he knew that speaking out like this in public would offend Luo Jin, at the brink of life and death, he couldn't care less.
