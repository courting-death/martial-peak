## Chapter 480 — You Really Want to Kill Me?

“If you really want to, then just try.” Yang Wei’s expression grew calm.

Meng Shanyi was stunned.

He hadn’t expected Yang Wei to not stop him from acting on his own accord and taking matters into his own hands. For a moment, he was dumbfounded. Then, overjoyed, he exclaimed, “Thank you, Eldest Young Master, for allowing this!”

Yang Wei did not deny it, but instead cast a glance at him filled with some pity.

“Ninth Young Master, forgive me!” Meng Shanyi’s face darkened as he waved his hand.

In an instant, more than a dozen experts above the Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage attacked Yang Kai from all directions.

This was the side hall of Yang Wei’s residence. Although the space was not small, it was not large either! Meng Shanyi could not bring in too many people. Among those dozen or so Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage and above experts, five had even reached the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, forming what he considered a formidable lineup to easily capture Yang Kai.

As he gave the order, Meng Shanyi narrowed his eyes, searching for Ying Jiu’s position.

Ying Jiu remained hidden. However, when those dozen Divine Roaming Realm warriors drew near Yang Kai, no less than three zhang away, a faint arc curled at the corner of Yang Kai’s mouth.

Suddenly, a chilling dark glow burst forth within him, an obscure and sinister energy rippling out. Amidst the confusion and suspicion of the attacking warriors, the martial skills they launched vanished as if sinking into the depths, not even rippling the air before disappearing entirely.

Stunned, they all retreated simultaneously.

Looking carefully, all were visibly moved.

In Yang Kai’s hand, a bone shield had appeared unbeknownst to anyone. The shield was oddly shaped, about the size of a millstone, its edges lined with jagged, razor-sharp bone spikes standing upright. At its center was a monstrous beast’s mouth, blood-red and wide open, bristling with fierce fangs, terrifying enough to send chills down one’s spine.

At this moment, the bone shield radiated a faint, exquisite glow. Yang Kai simply held it in front of him, standing quietly, yet it gave everyone the feeling of an impenetrable fortress.

Yang Wei’s expression turned strange, and Meng Shanyi could barely believe what he saw.

This very bone shield was the one Liu Qingyao seized a few days ago and then passed to Yang Kai. It was a Mystery-Grade treasure of the defensive type.

Only seven days had passed; how had Yang Kai already refined it?

As a Mystery-Grade defensive treasure, breaking through its defenses was no simple feat—but that did not mean it was invincible. The group had not attacked at full power. If all those Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage and above warriors launched an all-out assault, surely they could breach the bone shield.

There was no time to dwell on this; Meng Shanyi shouted angrily once more, “Attack!”

The dozen or so warriors’ expressions hardened with cold resolve. Holding nothing back, they unleashed their martial skills and the dazzling light of their treasures. The earth shook and the heavens roared as the explosive attack enveloped Yang Kai.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Loud blasts echoed as the side hall trembled violently, cracks sprouting across the walls like spiderwebs.

Yang Kai’s steps faltered and he retreated repeatedly, his face flushed and his True Yuan under immense pressure. Yet the bone shield in his hands remained firm, blocking all attacks. The energy unleashed by the warriors and their treasures was absorbed by the beast’s gaping maw on the shield, swallowed without a trace.

What baffled everyone even more was that, as it consumed the energy, the bone shield suddenly expanded rapidly.

After a single barrage, its surface grew to more than three times its original size, completely shielding Yang Kai behind it.

Meng Shanyi’s eyes trembled in disbelief. He had never imagined that a mere lower-level Mystery-Grade defensive treasure could withstand such an onslaught from so many Divine Roaming Realm experts.

He himself possessed Mystery-Grade treasures, but none worked as miraculously as this bone shield.

What was going on?

In astonishment, the look in Yang Kai’s eyes turned dangerous. He slammed the seemingly fragile bone shield into the ground, creating a large crater.

In the next instant, all the bone spikes jutting from the shield’s edge shot forth violently.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

These spikes were incredibly sharp, their aura overwhelming as they streaked forward with deadly force.

The dozen or so Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage and above warriors changed expression drastically and braced to defend themselves.

Boom!

From the beast’s mouth at the center of the shield exploded a terrifying beam of energy that caused hearts to quail in dread. It was as if the energy it had absorbed just moments ago was now being unleashed as counterattack.

The energy beam was thick as an arm and dashed straight toward Meng Shanyi.

A terrifying pressure descended suddenly. Facing the call of death, Meng Shanyi froze in fearful shock, unable to dodge in time.

“Ji Li!” Yang Wei roared.

Suddenly, a figure appeared before Meng Shanyi. The man had a square face, eyes gleaming with divine light, radiating authority without anger.

He was one of the two Blood Servants beside Yang Wei.

Ji Li appeared with a sharp shout, and golden light flared over his robust body, as if he were cast from pure gold, his exposed skin shimmering brilliantly.

He struck both fists forward, meeting the energy beam head-on.

With a tremendous explosion, Ji Li was thrown backward midair, his golden glow dimming as the beam vanished completely.

Meng Shanyi stood dumbfounded, sweat pouring from his forehead, a look of terror and panic on his face.

His eyes involuntarily revealed deep fear and reverence as they flickered toward Yang Kai.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The dozen or so Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage and above warriors deflected the speeding bone spikes back to the shield’s edge. The swollen bone shield shrank back down to millstone size after the energy beam was fired, losing its former menace.

Suddenly, the scene fell silent. No one dared move.

Yang Kai had held off all attacks with a single Mystery-Grade treasure, and Ying Jiu, hidden in the shadows, had yet to act.

Even if this time they could capture Yang Kai, it would come at a great cost.

“Both offense and defense are well-prepared. Ninth Brother, you have acquired quite the treasure.” Yang Wei looked at the bone shield in Yang Kai’s hand with burning eyes, full of envy, as if nothing had happened.

“Eldest Brother, your treasure shouldn't be any worse, right?” Yang Kai chuckled, storing away the bone shield.

Yang Wei smiled but said nothing more. Yet both knew that even if Yang Wei’s treasures were not poor, none could compare to that bone shield.

From what had just transpired, that treasure was extraordinary, capable of swallowing attacks and reflecting them. Such treasures were rare indeed.

Yang Wei mused that the bone shield’s effects might vary depending on its wielder.

“Ninth Young Master,” Meng Shanyi, still shaken, looked straight at Yang Kai and asked gravely, “Did you really... want to kill me just now?”

The destructive power contained in that energy beam had been enormous. Although Meng Shanyi possessed Mystery-Grade treasures himself, he was unsure whether they could withstand such force.

If struck, who knew what would have become of him.

The succession war was no stranger to death. Yet those who died were generally unimportant, and none dared kill the young lords and ladies of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu. In all past succession wars, not a single noble scion of Zhongdu had died, and the chances of injury were slim.

If Ji Li had not defended that beam at the critical moment just now, Meng Shanyi might have set a precedent.

Meng Shanyi cared deeply whether Yang Kai had truly wanted to kill him.

“What do you think?” Yang Kai said nothing, instead grinning broadly at him.

Meng Shanyi’s expression darkened. His heartbeat quickened. This Ninth Young Master... really might have wanted to kill him.

“Eldest Brother, let’s call it quits over what happened just now. Ninth Brother will leave first.” Yang Kai nodded to Yang Wei, covering his face, and left calmly.

No one stopped him anymore. Meng Shanyi dared not give any further orders. Yang Wei harbored no intention of holding Yang Kai back, and the dozen or so Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage and above experts naturally would not act rashly.

After Yang Kai left, Yang Wei glanced faintly at Meng Shanyi and said, “Ninth Brother was merely warning you. He had no intention of killing you.”

“Who can say?” Meng Shanyi took a deep breath, calming the turmoil and fear within. “At least, I’ve witnessed Ninth Young Master’s madness firsthand.”

He shook his head with a bitter smile. “But it’s true as Eldest Young Master said, he dares to venture so lone because he has some support. That bone shield... it’s too strange. Even as a Mystery-Grade defensive treasure, it should not function with such power.”

If Mystery-Grade treasures were all that formidable, cultivation would be pointless.

Generally, Mystery-Grade defensive treasures could not withstand the attacks of so many experts combined.

“Fifth Brother is probably done for,” Yang Wei said with deep eyes.

“I think so too,” Meng Shanyi agreed solemnly.

Having refined a Mystery-Grade defensive treasure days in advance, plus Ying Jiu abruptly lifting the Sealing Yuan Curse and regaining peak Martial Peak strength, Yang Kai’s advantage over Yang Kang was great.

How could the calculating Yang Kang resist?

Most likely, when Yang Kai leads the assault against Yang Kang tomorrow, Yang Kang will still be trying to refine his own treasure. With such a head start, plus the Blood Servants and the treasure gap, Yang Kang’s defeat is certain.

“Shanyi, scheming is not your forte,” Yang Wei frowned. “If I were you, I wouldn’t make a move within the residence. Instead, I’d send people to someone else’s mansion to leak Ninth Brother’s whereabouts, then just watch the show.”

Hearing this, Meng Shanyi was stunned. He looked at Yang Wei, surprised that this usually straightforward and aloof man had such a cunning side.

But thinking it over, Yang Wei’s suggestion was brilliant! If only he had done that earlier, he could have watched the tiger fight from safety.

He cursed his own tardiness in frustration. “Eldest Young Master, if you thought of this, why didn’t you say it sooner?”

Yang Wei shook his head slowly. “Be more disciplined from now on. I have no intention of fighting Ninth Brother before the succession war concludes.”

“I understand.” Meng Shanyi nodded softly, shivering as he recalled the perilous moment just now and unwilling to say more.

Outside Yang Wei’s residence, Yang Kai walked alone in the shadows. Having caused such a commotion, naturally many paid close attention to Yang Wei’s mansion.

Yang Kai slipped out stealthily and quickly concealed his form, drawing no one’s notice.

Ying Jiu silently followed beside him. They stopped in a dim alley, where Yang Kai drew a deep breath, steadying his turbulent Qi and blood within.
