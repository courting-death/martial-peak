## Chapter 2134 — Wuchang

Time passed, and scattered cultivators gradually arrived from all directions.

However, their numbers were not great; it seemed they were all from small Sects or family clans located far from this place.

After arriving, they wisely chose unoccupied spots to set up camp. Those who knew each other naturally gathered together, preparing to join forces inside the Four Seasons Land and make a big move.

Only cultivators at the Dao Origin Realm could enter the Four Seasons Land; those at the Void King Realm simply did not qualify, and entering would be courting death.

However, this did not mean that Emperor Realm experts could not enter the Four Seasons Land.

In fact they could enter, but each Emperor Realm cultivator who did so would destabilize the entrance. If more than three Emperor Realm experts entered, the entrance would immediately close.

Because of this the few Emperor Realm slots couldn't be allocated fairly, so at Star God Palace's suggestion Emperor Realm cultivators were barred from entering to prevent the entrance from closing prematurely.

Yang Kai had learned all this information from the jade slip Murong Xiaoxiao had given him.

As he recalled the details recorded in the jade slip, he tried to memorize everything while also strengthening his connection with the Myriad Sword.

Although this Imperial Treasure would eventually be returned to the Qin Family, it should be of great help to him inside the Four Seasons Land.

"What are you doing!"

Suddenly, a woman's angry shout reached his ears, and at the same time, a powerful force erupted from a certain spot.

The woman immediately cried out in surprise, emitting a muffled groan as if she'd been struck.

Yang Kai snapped his eyes open, frowned, and looked in the direction of the voice.

He recognized the owner of the voice—it was Murong Xiaoxiao, who had given him the information about the Four Seasons Land.

He found it strange; Murong Xiaoxiao was an elite disciple of Qingyang Shrine, with a high cultivation. Who would dare cause trouble for her in a place like this?

Looking over, he saw Murong Xiaoxiao biting her red lips, her gaze wary and furious as she stared in one direction. Beside her, another female disciple from Qingyang Shrine supported her, nervously asking, "Xiaoxiao, are you alright?"

Murong Xiaoxiao shook her head, indicating she was fine.

But judging from her slightly disordered aura, she had clearly just experienced a dangerous moment.

The place she was looking at was a gathering spot for Dao Origin Realm cultivators, and among them was one particularly strange-looking man.

This man was male, but it was as if an invisible line divided his body down the center—his left side, skin and hair, was fiery red, while his right side was pure white. The two starkly different colors on one person created a strong visual impact and gave off completely different impressions: the left side was masculine, the right side feminine.

Murong Xiaoxiao's angry gaze was fixed on this man!

He held one hand aloft, making it clear he was the culprit; a faint trace of lingering power still clung to his fingertip.

A figure flashed by, stepping in front of Murong Xiaoxiao and quietly staring at the strange cultivator.

It was Xia Sheng!

Oddly enough, Xia Sheng's figure was not particularly tall, yet standing there he gave off the feeling of a solid mountain—extremely reliable.

Yang Kai frowned and also stood up, slowly walking over.

"Xiaoxiao, what happened?" Xia Sheng asked calmly.

Murong Xiaoxiao said, "I don't know. That man suddenly attacked me!"

"Oh?" Xia Sheng narrowed his eyes and said coolly, "Interesting. Someone dares to bully Qingyang Shrine right under our noses? This won't be settled so easily!"

As he spoke, a dangerous cold light flashed in his eyes.

The strange-looking cultivator also turned his gaze to Xia Sheng. Their eyes met in the void, and sparks seemed to fly…

The atmosphere suddenly grew tense, as if a sword had been drawn.

On Qingyang Shrine's side, and among the other gathered cultivators, expressions grew serious as they quietly circulated their Origin Qi.

It looked as if a great battle was about to break out.

The commotion spread like ripples from a stone thrown into a calm lake, and many turned to watch.
"Xia Sheng?" The strange-looking cultivator suddenly curled his lips in a wicked smile and spoke, as if he knew Xia Sheng but was meeting him for the first time.

"Wuchang?" Xia Sheng raised his brows.

Yang Kai frowned as he listened. He had never heard the name Wuchang before, but judging by Xia Sheng's wary expression, this fellow was clearly not easy to deal with.

This man likely possessed some kind of special physique! That would explain his bizarre appearance.

"Is that Xia Sheng from Qingyang Shrine? I heard he took first place in the sect's recent martial contest."

Among the onlookers, someone exclaimed in surprise. It seemed Xia Sheng was quite well-known.

"Wuchang… isn't he the rising star of Tianwu Sacred Land? That's right, with that appearance it must be him. Rumor has it Wuchang possesses the Yin-Yang Twin Body… so that's what it looks like, truly eye-opening!"

"Shh… keep your voice down. I hear Wuchang is moody and violent. If he hears you…"

"What's there to be afraid of? There are so many people here, what could he possibly do to me…"

The speaker fell silent when Wuchang turned and fixed him with a cold stare.
In that moment, the man's mismatched red and white eyes released a mysterious power, manifesting before him as a massive red-and-white vortex. From the vortex came a terrifying force of strangulation, sweeping toward him.

The man cried out in terror and tried to retreat hastily.
But to his horror, his body suddenly became rigid and immobile. He could only stand there, face pale, eyes trembling as he watched the vortex spin closer and closer.

"Ah!"

Bang—

With a loud explosion, the man's head burst like a smashed watermelon, scattering red and white matter in all directions. The nearby cultivators quickly retreated in fear.

The headless corpse slowly toppled over, raising a cloud of dust and a pool of blood—a truly gruesome sight.

The other cultivator who had spoken with him earlier was so shocked by his companion's fate that he didn't even think of seeking revenge. Instead, he was scared witless, collapsing to the ground as if his soul had left his body, his teeth chattering uncontrollably, unable to utter a single word.

Who knew which small Sect or family these two belonged to? They had finally earned a spot in the Four Seasons Land, only for one of them to meet disaster for a careless remark.

At the Wuhua Hall camp, a handsome man in green stood watching the horrific scene, unable to help but snort coldly. He turned to his Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters and said, "Remember, once inside the Four Seasons Land, if you encounter Wuchang, run as far as you can—never face him head-on!"

"Yes, Senior Brother Zhuang!" The group replied quickly, all deeply shaken.

After witnessing Wuchang's brutal killing method, none of them had any desire to challenge him. In their minds, only Senior Brother Zhuang Bufan might be able to contend with Wuchang.

"So that's Tianwu Sacred Land's Wuchang?"

At the Star God Palace encampment, Lan Xun, robed in blue like a sprite, hovered in midair, while to her left a handsome, fair-faced youth stood guard at her side.

At that moment, Lan Xun frowned slightly, displeased as she spoke.

After all, she was a woman; witnessing that brutal scene moments ago left her somewhat unsettled and displeased.

"That's right." The pale-faced man nodded, his eyes never leaving Lan Xun's beautiful face, his gaze filled with fervent admiration. He said, "I've fought that fellow a few times before—he's tough to deal with."

"Even Brother Xiao can't handle him?" Lan Xun asked in surprise.

Xiao Chen said, "If I used the Imperial Treasure my father gave me, I could defeat him, but… the cost would be too great!"

"I see…" Lan Xun was unconcerned. Although Xiao Chen was the son of Xiao Yuyang and possessed an Imperial Treasure given by his father, who could say Wuchang didn't have one as well?

After all, Tianwu Sacred Land was no ordinary force. As its top rising star, it was only natural for Wuchang to have an Imperial Treasure for protection.

"Princess doesn't believe me?" Xiao Chen seemed to sense something, raising his brows and saying, "If Princess wants to see for herself, I can go right now…"

"No need!" Lan Xun waved her hand, frowning. "I was just speaking casually."

Xiao Chen said, "Still… for Wuchang to kill someone so brazenly in public, he really doesn't care about Star God Palace at all. No matter what, the Southern Territory isn't a place for Tianwu Sacred Land to do as it pleases!"

Lan Xun said nothing, her beautiful eyes flickering as she suddenly let out a soft cry of surprise, her gaze showing unexpected interest as she looked into the distance at a certain figure.

"It's that guy!" Lan Xun thought to herself.

She still remembered, the last time she was breaking through to the Dao Origin Realm on the Third Stage of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, that guy had somehow snuck into the Third Stage and snatched away many fragments of Law Power from her.

But… it was lucky he appeared. Otherwise, given the situation at the time, even if she had managed to break through, she would have suffered greatly, perhaps even been seriously injured.

Lan Xun was very interested in this man and wanted to know how he had managed to sneak into the supposedly sealed Third Stage of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, and what technique he had used to snatch so much Law Power!

After leaving the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda she had secluded herself to consolidate her cultivation, so she hadn't thought much more about him.

She hadn't expected to see him again in the valley—and he had advanced to the Dao Origin Realm.
