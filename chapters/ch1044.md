## Chapter 1044 — Somewhat Extraordinary

When Xin Rui's voice rang out, Yang Kai was still immersed in studying the Star Chart.

From that urgent, terrified roar he sensed something was wrong. He immediately withdrew his Divine Sense, and then felt violent energy rippling in from all directions so intense that he had the sudden illusion he might instantly be killed.

The compass trembled, and a message from Xue Tong came through it: "Young Master, hurry…"

His words never finished; the signal cut off.

The room suddenly shattered; a slab of the barrier materialized then evaporated into nothing, and Yang Kai's body was exposed directly to the Starry Sky.

He looked around and saw clouds of blood-red mist explode open and witnessed Hengluo Commerce Guild cultivators struggling to flee, but they could not escape those devouring ripples.

Ripples flowed through their bodies in concentric circles, like the sharpest blades, slicing them into powder.

Realizing the danger, Yang Kai summoned all his strength and lunged into the void, trying to tear space and flee.

To his despair, his normally infallible technique to rend space failed this time; no tear opened. The ripples ruptured outward, affecting the spatial field across this vast area and throwing the space here into utter chaos.

Yang Kai could not tear space!

One by one, black, hole-like tears formed around the warship, opening and closing like fish jaws, devouring everything nearby.

His face darkened. He instantaneously activated Demon God Transformation, pushing his power to the utmost, and without hesitation fled in the opposite direction of the ripples' spread.

The deathly aura behind him clung like maggots to the bones, unwilling to let go; the shattered space was like the fiercest spatial weapon, cutting every inch of Yang Kai's flesh until he was a bloody mess, while golden radiance pulsed about his body.

He clenched his teeth against the pain. Rotating Saint Yuan, he condensed layer upon layer of the Vast Heaven Shield to guard himself, and the long-unused Silver Leaf Secret Treasure was finally invoked, transforming into a milky river of stars that wrapped him in an impenetrable embrace.

Hiss, hiss, hiss…

The force of space kept cutting. The silver light quickly dimmed; that Silver Leaf Secret Treasure, a Saint-Grade Upper-Level artifact, rapidly lost its spiritual potency and immediately collapsed.

The treasure was destroyed outright.

The brittle cracking sounds never ceased as the Vast Heaven Shields Yang Kai manifested could not withstand that world-shattering force; shields that had only just formed shattered, offering him no breathing room.

Pain wracked his whole body; Yang Kai almost believed he was about to die.

His speed had already reached its limit. Roaring, he threw himself desperately forward to break free and carve out a path to survival.

At that moment, an angry shout came from the side.

"Young Master, go! I will buy you some time!"

Yang Kai stole a glance and saw an old man freeze in place, arms spread as if to embrace something, his expression grave as he faced the approaching ripples. Strange energy radiated from him. The aura of the Origin Returning Realm spread as he released his power, using his own strength as a pillar, forcibly prying open a space tear that was about to close, tearing it wider.

The ripples rolled up to him and he stood like someone embracing death—unmoving. That world-shattering force fell upon him, leaving him instantly bloodied, his clothes torn to pieces, flesh ripped apart.

Yet because of his effort, many of the destructive forces were channeled into that space tear.

Yang Kai suddenly felt the pressure ease and his heart leaped with joy.

Not far from the old man, a young man with hair draped over his shoulders and a face so handsome it verged on the uncanny glared with fury at the man who had sacrificed himself for him. He wanted to save him but was powerless, teeth clenched, and he manifested a suit of armor—fiery red, dazzling—plates assembling over his body, wrapping him in a heroic sheen.

He and Yang Kai exchanged a look and then bolted in the same direction.

Xue Yue!

Yang Kai cursed inwardly, wanting to stop and throttle the man here and now.

The other's eyes were bright with grief; he clearly recognized him, but in the desperate moment of escape he had no time to pay him heed. Both fists were clenched—helplessness and fury written plainly—and he turned back once more, imprinting the image of the old man's pulverization into the depths of his memory, burying the hatred in his heart, then fled without looking back.

The Origin Returning Realm old man held the delay for less than three breaths; the space tear he had forced open was destroyed, and ripples continued to spread outward with unchecked momentum.

Very soon the ripples reached where Yang Kai and Xue Yue had been.

Yang Kai felt a staggering blow as if struck by tens of thousands of fists; every inch of his skin split, his Sea of Consciousness churned, the world spun, and he lost consciousness.

In the instant before he blacked out, he saw Xue Yue's armor peeling away in pieces, his garments tearing bit by bit to reveal a flawless, alabaster body beneath.

Yang Kai's pupils dilated; he felt as if he had seen something extraordinary…

Those two bulging pectorals of his… seemed rather extraordinary.

Yang Kai thought this strangely, then lost consciousness.

……

In the cold, dark Star Domain, a desolate silence reigned.

The nearby Meteorite Sea that had once existed had been swept clean in that blast; huge Saint King-Grade Upper-Level warship was nowhere to be found, hundreds of cultivators aboard gone without a trace, and all supplies lost.

It was as if none of it had ever existed—no trace remained.

Amid the stillness, Yang Kai's bloodied, mangled form drifted quietly through the Star Domain; he seemed to be asleep, with no sign of when he might wake.

Golden light enveloped him; the potent regenerative power of his Demon God Golden Blood took effect again, causing his shredded flesh to writhe and wounds to knit rapidly, new flesh growing where it was missing.

His fingers twitched and his eyelids struggled open. His gaze was vacant; he was groggy and not fully alert.

Scenes from before his faint flitted before his eyes—desperate screams and roars echoed in his ears—and he immediately realized what he had faced.

He suddenly sprang up but then froze, his body rigid.

He felt as if every bone in his body had been dismantled; scars covered him everywhere.

He lay back down and probed his condition with Divine Sense.

The situation was dire: much of his flesh was missing, his meridians severely damaged, flow of power impeded; he did not have half the strength he had at his peak.

Even with his robust constitution and Demon God Golden Blood, to fully recover from such injuries would require at least half a month.

After assessing his condition, he retrieved a Saint Pill from the Demon God's Secret Codex and swallowed it to dispel the wounds' lingering effects.

He felt somewhat fortunate; if not for the Origin Returning Realm old man who delayed matters for a short while near Xue Yue, his injuries might have been far worse—or he might have perished in that calamity.

Even an Origin Returning Realm expert had already perished—so what chance did a minor figure like him, merely at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, possibly have?

What about Xue Yue? Was he dead?

Recalling the scene before losing consciousness, Yang Kai's expression turned strange. He thought carefully and confirmed he had not hallucinated: that famed Hengluo Commerce Guild Young Master actually hid such a colossal secret!

Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense but detected no life nearby. Even if Xue Yue had not died, he was likely in no better shape than Yang Kai. Having accidentally glimpsed the other's secret, and given that the man had previously tried to kill him intentionally, there was little chance he would let the matter rest.

Yang Kai had already marked Xue Yue as his enemy!

Xue Tong…

He thought of another person and hurriedly took out the compass, pouring his Divine Sense into it to try to contact Xue Tong.

To his disappointment, no matter how he called there was no response. Before the catastrophe, Xue Tong had sent Yang Kai a message via the compass to flee, but the connection was cut off before he could finish.

He must have run into trouble at that moment.

Yang Kai sighed softly and put the compass away, feeling a pang of sorrow—Xue Tong likely had little hope of survival. That yao warrior had been a decent companion, and had it not been for Shen Tu insisting he take Yang Kai away, he would not have suffered this misfortune.

He truly was unlucky…

Who had set that trap in the Meteorite Sea to try to destroy a Hengluo Commerce Guild warship?

What kind of trap could possibly possess such world-shattering, heaven-destroying power?

Was it an act of vengeance, or was it aimed at a particular individual? Yang Kai had no way of knowing.

He only remembered Xin Rui had shouted something like Fragmented Star Flash before the disaster, but he did not know what that meant.

He silently resolved to uncover the truth behind it all—not only because he had nearly lost his own life, but also to give Shen Tu an explanation for Xue Tong’s death!

A tug pulled at him from below, dragging his body downward. Yang Kai turned his head with effort and looked down: tens of thousands of zhang below him lay a modest dead star.

The pull was the gravity emitted by that dead star.

He allowed himself to fall.

Two hours later, just as he was about to hit the dead star's surface, he gathered his strength and stabilized his posture, and then landed.

Looking around, the dead star was truly lifeless—an arid wasteland like a barren desert, without a single blade of grass or sign of life, pitted with hollows and ridges.

He now stood beside a vast crater, completely naked.

—His clothes had been destroyed in that explosion.

After this period of recovery, Yang Kai felt significantly better. Just as he was about to retrieve a set of clothes from the Demon God's Secret Codex, his expression changed and he released his Divine Sense.

He detected a faint life aura not far from him.

His face shifted slightly; with no time to hesitate he darted toward it.
