## Chapter 197 â€” Gu Yun Island

On the boundless sea, a figure was flying swiftly. From the figure's back sprouted two wings resembling those of a great bird, yet these wings burned like raging flames, distorting the air as they passed.

Yang Kai had left Hidden Island for a day. Throughout this day and night, he had been flying, carrying two large bundles. One bundle contained the rare treasures he had collected from Hidden Island, while the other held the items from the stone platform.

Flying with these two bundles was far from pleasant. Several times, Yang Kai wished he could throw them all into the sea, yet he could not bring himself to do so.

The Yang Liquid in his dantian was constantly depleting. The consumption of Yuan Qi required by the Wings of Yang Flame was immense; in just one day, he had lost nearly two hundred drops of Yang Liquid. If he had not made ample preparations beforehand, he would surely have struggled to return to Haicheng City.

The strange insects had been left on Hidden Island. Although these insects were obedient and occasionally quite useful, Yang Kai truly did not know how to take them with him and could only bear the pain of abandoning them.

The sea stretched endlessly, the azure waters rippling beneath him, reflecting the clear blue sky and evoking a sense of insignificance and panic.

Fortunately, the weather had been good these past few days, and the storm he feared had not appeared.

After flying for so long, Yang Kai felt somewhat fatigued. The headwind buffeting against him nearly numbed his face, and his physical strength was severely depleted, though he did not feel mentally tired. He suspected this was related to the Warm Spirit Lotus he had absorbed into his body, nourishing his spirit and preventing any feelings of exhaustion.

Squinting ahead, he spotted the outline of a small island about fifty li away. Yang Kai's expression brightened, and he quickly changed direction to fly toward it.

Before long, he arrived. With the Wings of Yang Flame, his speed was indeed remarkable.

Upon arrival, Yang Kai realized that this could hardly be called an island; it was merely a large stone occupying an area of only a few zhang. He did not know why it protruded above the sea.

Without further ado, he hurriedly placed down the two bundles and collapsed onto the stone, gasping for air.

After a while, Yang Kai finally regained his breath, rubbing his face vigorously to restore sensation.

"Hehe, Young Master, your strength is not yet at the True Yuan Realm. Once you reach the True Yuan Realm, with True Yuan protecting your body, flying will not be so uncomfortable," Di Mo comforted.

"I now understand why martial artists below the True Yuan Realm dare not use flying treasures lightly. This feeling is truly unbearable," Yang Kai said, smacking his lips.

"Actually, Young Master, you are already doing well. If you hadn't refined a few drops of Coagulated Blood Pearls beforehand and your vitality wasn't strong enough, you wouldn't have been able to endure for so long."

After recovering most of his strength, Yang Kai set off again.

Another day and night passed before he finally caught sight of land on the horizon.

The Wings of Yang Flame behind him were too conspicuous, and the two bundles he carried could not be exposed; otherwise, they would surely attract deadly trouble. He specifically sought out a secluded spot and, confirming that no one was around, landed.

After checking, he found that only a few dozen drops of Yang Liquid remained in his dantian. Over the course of more than two days, he had consumed over four hundred drops of Yang Liquid. Such a loss would have been unbearable without prior preparation.

Turning to survey his surroundings, Yang Kai felt that this place was unfamiliar, but he believed he must be close to Haicheng City. While on the grand ship of Yunxia, he had observed the direction daily, and when he left Hidden Island, he had flown in the opposite direction.

After walking for a long time, he finally reached the official road.

Yang Kai was now covered in dust, his clothes tattered, making him look no different from a beggar. However, the two bundles he carried were somewhat alluring; if he encountered robbers on the road, it would surely be a troublesome matter.

As he walked along the official road, he passed a small teahouse and inquired with the couple selling tea. Only then did he realize he had indeed veered off course.

This place was a full thousand li away from Haicheng City.

After confirming his location, Yang Kai once again spread his Wings of Yang Flame and flew toward Haicheng City.

There, a grudge remained unresolved!

An hour later, Yang Kai arrived near Haicheng City. He did not enter the city immediately but sought out the residence of the old man and his granddaughter by the sea.

The dilapidated door was wide open, and the sea breeze rushed into the house, making the entire place feel exceptionally cold.

Stepping inside, Yang Kai found that the furnishings were unchanged from when he had been captured that night. The old man and the silent little girl were no longer there; they must have left long ago.

When he left that night, he had given the old man many silver notes, enough for him and the little girl to live without worry for several lifetimes. As long as he was careful, they would no longer suffer hardships.

Finding a safe and hidden spot nearby, Yang Kai carefully concealed both bundles, taking only a Middle-Level Earth-Grade Spirit Herb with him to exchange for some silver.

A day later, Yang Kai appeared in Haicheng City.

He did not do much, only gathered useful information. For several consecutive days, he had been probing various sources of information, returning to the dilapidated house by the sea each night.

Three days later, Yang Kai took action. His target was Yunxia Sect! Although the deaths of the three Jiang sisters had little to do with Yunxia, there were still some connections. Moreover, Yang Kai had an irreconcilable grudge with Yunxia Sect. The parents of that silent little girl must have also perished within Yunxia.

On one night, he quietly flew out, making some arrangements.

There was no need for further action; he could simply watch from the sidelines.

In the morning, Gu Yun Island.

The disciples awoke from their cultivation, each attending to their duties, managing the various affairs of the island.

As a top-tier force overseas, Gu Yun Island occupied more than three islands. Compared to a sect like Yunxia, whether in terms of resources or the quality of disciples, they were far superior.

Relying on the resources produced by these three islands, the disciples had indeed excelled. For hundreds or even thousands of years, talented individuals had emerged, and although they could not compete with the transcendent Tai Yi Sect, they had made a name for themselves, their reputation widespread, and few dared to provoke them.

However, the disciples of Gu Yun Island all knew that their sect harbored a secret that could not be spoken of: three hundred years ago, they had lost a supreme technique that had yet to be recovered.

Such secrets existed in every major force overseas.

But the young were curious about these matters. If any rumors leaked, they would always dig deeper. One would tell two, two would tell three, and they would discuss it privately with great enthusiasm, each of them well aware but never daring to speak of it in front of their elders.

Zhong Miao was an ordinary disciple of Gu Yun Island, her aptitude not particularly good. After several years on the island, she had only reached the second stage of the Qi Movement Realm.

She had been assigned to a remote area of Gu Yun Island, feeding several peacocks that were the beloved pets of an elder. She had little to do besides teasing and caring for these peacocks, and diligently cultivating. She knew that with her mediocre aptitude, it would be exceedingly difficult to stand out in the talented Gu Yun Island.

Yet, she did not complain about her fate; she simply worked hard to do her best.

When she woke up in the morning, Zhong Miao opened her door as usual, intending to feed the peacocks that were much more noble than herself. However, just as she stepped out, she saw a dagger inserted into her door, with a letter beneath it.

Strange, who left a letter here?

Zhong Miao was puzzled but still reached out to take the letter, glancing down to see a line of large characters written on it: "To be opened by the Island Master and Elders of Gu Yun Island!"

Zhong Miao immediately pouted, thinking it was some senior brother or sister playing a prank on her.

Such things had happened before. With her low strength and status, no connections, and not being particularly beautiful, she was often bullied for amusement by some annoying senior brothers and sisters.

Moreover, the wording of the letter was quite odd, demanding to be opened by the "Island Master and Elders."

Since it was meant for the Island Master or the Elders, why was it stuck on my door? Zhong Miao's chest heaved, feeling somewhat wronged; those people were truly annoying.

Feeling a bit angry, she still opened the letter, pulling out a yellowed page.

Upon closer inspection, she softly murmured, "Transforming Moonbreaker Technique?"

As she read it aloud, her expression froze for a moment.

Why did it sound somewhat familiar? Moreover, this yellowed page looked quite old, at least a few hundred years old.

"Transforming Moonbreaker Technique?" Zhong Miao murmured again, memories flashing through her mind. Her eyes suddenly widened, filled with disbelief, and her jade hands trembled uncontrollably, as if the page had become scalding hot.

Isn't this... isn't this the name of that supreme technique? She had heard people say privately that the technique lost by the sect three hundred years ago was called Transforming Moonbreaker Technique.

Just a few days ago, she had overheard the elder who came to visit the peacocks muttering that if the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique had not been lost, the cultivation speed of those talented senior brothers and sisters on the island would have improved significantly.

Is this real or fake? Zhong Miao's heart raced, and she felt like crying.

Looking again at the yellowed page, she hurriedly stuffed it back into the letter, forgetting about the peacocks, and ran out, lifting her skirt as she dashed away.

On the way, she encountered a few annoying senior brothers and sisters, but Zhong Miao didn't even hear their mocking words.

After running for more than ten li, she finally arrived at the residence of the peacocks' ownerâ€”Elder Han Zhao.

Before she could enter, she was stopped by two senior brothers.

"What do you want?" one of them coldly asked.

Zhong Miao gasped for breath, taking a while to calm down, covering her chest as she trembled and said, "Senior brothers, I need to see Elder Han. I have something important to report."

Although her status and strength were low, she knew this matter was significant and did not dare to casually mention anything about the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique.

The senior brother sneered, "The elder is in seclusion and won't see anyone."

"This is truly important!" Zhong Miao was frantic, trying to push her way in, but unexpectedly, she was shoved back by the senior brother.

"You, a little girl who feeds peacocks, what important matter could you possibly have?" the other one chuckled, clearly looking down on her.

Zhong Miao puffed her cheeks and glared at the two senior brothers, but they would not let her pass. In her desperation, she did not know where her courage came from. She cupped her hands around her mouth, gathering her strength to shout, "Elder Han, something big has happened! Your peacocks are all dead!"
