## Chapter 1597 — If You Don't Want to Die, Then Wait There

No one had anticipated this turn of events, and no one had ever encountered anything like it before; there wasn't even a whisper of rumor to prepare them.

Five people found themselves inside the same Domain vortex, but astonishingly the vast majority of the vortex's power was being drawn toward a single person; it seemed even the Domain vortex had begun to target that person, denying him access to the very center.

The three elders felt their pressure suddenly ease; naturally they saw a sliver of hope and were unwilling to surrender the Domain Stones.

They closed on the center with blistering speed, faces cold and fierce, staring at Yang Kai with a murderous intent—clearly hostile.

Xue Sun's expression shifted; after shouting a warning to Yang Kai she too dashed forward.

"If you don't want to die, wait there!" Yang Kai's voice suddenly rang in her ear.

Xue Sun's raised foot never advanced; she watched Yang Kai's back with a shifting expression, her brows slightly furrowed, not understanding what trick he was playing.

But she did not probe further; she chose to trust Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's situation looked perilous—the tremendous Domain power he was drawing in was hardly something an Origin Returning Realm could withstand; the fact that he could remain standing was itself a miracle.

Xue Sun clearly felt Yang Kai's Shi being suppressed back into his body inch by inch; his Shi simply could not contend with that uncanny Domain power.

She couldn't help but grow anxious; she didn't know what fate would befall him once his Shi was completely suppressed.

He very well might die on the spot!

If that happened, Little Senior Sister Qingluo would surely grieve herself to death; it was said the two of them were quite close...

Under her tense watch, Yang Kai’s Shi clashed head-on with the Domain power within the vortex—like two great armies locked in fierce battle. Yet Yang Kai’s Shi was routed again and again, collapsing like a broken front, utterly suppressed.

His Shi field shrank bit by bit until it only covered the area immediately around his body.

The fluctuations within the Domain vortex grew stranger and more violent, as if all its power had been drawn to Yang Kai, launching a merciless final strike that in an instant shattered his Shi field and submerged him entirely.

Xue Sun couldn't help but give a sharp cry and turned away, unable to bear the thought of seeing Yang Kai's body torn apart.

The imagined shower of blood and flesh never came; Xue Sun, filled with doubt, then heard Yang Kai's loud laughter—amid that desperate situation it sounded unusually free and unburdened.

She whipped her head around and stared at Yang Kai in astonishment; to her surprise, the man submerged in the Domain field was completely unharmed.

"How can this be?" Xue Sun was stunned.

She had felt no trace of Yang Kai releasing any Shi. He stood unguarded at the very center of the Domain vortex and yet remained unscathed!

A strange force swirled around Yang Kai, merging him with the Domain vortex; without the naked eye one would be unable to detect his presence—at that moment he seemed to have fused with the vortex, becoming part of it.

He halted midair and then plunged down, truly arriving at the very center.

As his foot came down, the chaotic Domain vortex he had disturbed swiftly returned to order. The terrifying pressure that should have existed surged in again from all directions, forcing a muffled groan from Xue Sun as she struggled to withstand it.

The old man and his two companions weren’t nearly so lucky.

When their pressure had decreased earlier they had frantically surged inward, rushing several dozen zhang at a time and coming to within only about ten zhang of where Yang Kai stood.

Now that the Domain vortex's pressure had returned, how could they possibly withstand it?

The sudden onslaught of Domain power terrorized the three; they cried out and, in panic, poured their Saint Yuan into action and deployed various Secret Treasures around themselves, attempting to retreat.

This place was not somewhere they should have been able to reach—had Yang Kai not earlier diverted most of the vortex's pressure, they wouldn't have had the means to get here.

Now it was undoubtedly too late to pull back.

They could not resist the profound strangling force erupting in the Domain field. One by one their protective Secret Treasures shattered to powder. Amid screams, the three exploded and died, blood and entrails strewn across the ground...

Xue Sun stared blankly at it all, watching three experts of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm be killed within the span of three breaths—a chill ran from her head to her toes.

She suddenly recalled Yang Kai's earlier warning to her.

"If you don't want to die, wait there!"

She was certain that had she not listened to Yang Kai's counsel at that moment, the three elders' fate would have been hers as well; she too would have died then and there.

A mood of having narrowly escaped death rose inexplicably in her chest; Xue Sun's complexion paled somewhat.

This guy... so that was his plan? He intended to merge himself into the Domain vortex to escape its targeting? Where did he get the confidence to do that? How deep was his understanding of Shi?

Had he already comprehended the mysteries of the Domain?

Countless questions swirled in Xue Sun's mind, yet she did not press him. She only knew that this human's attainments in the Martial Dao were something to admire.

In truth, although this Domain vortex was formidable, had the three elders advanced step by step—gradually grasping its secrets and inching forward—they might still have had a chance to reach the very center instead of dying horribly.

Their misfortune lay in never getting the chance — Yang Kai had given them hope, only to bring despair crashing down the moment they glimpsed the light.

He needed little effort to use the vortex's power to slay all three!

If this had been something he'd planned from the start, that would be despicable...

It should have been a coincidence, right? Xue Sun's expression was a tangle of emotions.

"What are you standing there for? Get out." Yang Kai's voice rang out; Xue Sun started and came to herself, only to find Yang Kai already before her, casually playing with two Domain Stones that emitted an odd gleam.

As he spoke he casually tossed one Domain Stone over.

Xue Sun caught it and eyed him suspiciously, frowning: "Why give me one? I didn't do anything."

Yang Kai smiled faintly: "You brought me here, and you found the Domain Stones first, so I'll give you one. Don't want it? Give it back."

Xue Sun swiftly stored the Domain Stone inside her Spatial Ring.

Why turn down a free windfall?

Yang Kai chuckled: "I'll give you a Domain Stone, and I'll take those three fellows' Spatial Rings—there doesn't seem to be anything good inside them anyway."

"I didn't mean to take their Spatial Rings either," Xue Sun replied calmly. After a moment's thought she added, "Well then, let's part here. Good luck to you."

"You're not going out?" Yang Kai asked, surprised.

"I want to stay and continue to comprehend!" she said.

Yang Kai nodded and did not force her. With a serious tone he said, "Then good luck. I'll go ahead."

Saying that, he brushed past her and strode outward.

"Yang Kai!" Xue Sun suddenly called from behind.

"What?" Yang Kai turned to look at her.

"May I ask—how did you make yourself merge into the Domain vortex?" Xue Sun asked curiously.

Yang Kai stroked his chin, pondered for a moment, and smiled slightly: "I went with the flow."

"Went with the flow?" Xue Sun's brows knit as she weighed the deeper meaning of the phrase; suddenly her eyes brightened and she showed gratitude, sincerely saying, "Thank you!"

"You're welcome." Yang Kai waved his hand lightly and continued on without looking back, growing more distant.

...

In the days that followed, Yang Kai continued to roam about the Blood Prison; whenever he discovered a Domain vortex that matched his needs he would go study it, probing its secrets.

Drawing on the marvels within those Domain vortices, his Shi—and the terrifying speed of its growth—increased.

No Domain vortex could trap him so that he could not escape; for the most part he could enter and exit at will. Even when he met some powerful ones that cost him time, he could still merge into them and move freely within.

He discovered that the method Xu Dingyang had taught him before was somewhat off.

Using one's Shi to confront a Domain and glean its secrets might be one path, but integrating one's Shi into it permitted a deeper glimpse into its subtlety.

That was why he had told Xue Sun to "go with the flow."

But to do that requires an extremely strong mastery of one's Shi; otherwise one would only humiliate oneself.

Domain Stones were hard to come by—even in the Blood Prison they were exceedingly rare. Half a month after parting from Xue Sun, Yang Kai encountered dozens of Domain vortices and managed to obtain only two more Domain Stones.

While traveling he studied this peculiar material, the Domain Stone.

Inside they indeed harbored Domain power, of the same lineage as the Domain vortices within the Blood Prison.

Yet the Domain power contained in a Domain Stone was gentle, not as wild or intractable as a Domain vortex.

That gentleness was enough for any Origin Returning Realm to safely absorb, improving their understanding of Shi and allowing them to probe a Domain's secrets.

This was one of the reasons Domain Stones were so valuable.

Apart from Xue Sun, he hadn't bumped into any acquaintances—neither the yao experts who had rushed here with Di Chen, nor Qian Tong and the others who had remained on Cuiwei Star; he hadn't encountered a single one of them.

Yang Kai didn't know whether Qian Tong and the others had entered the Blood Prison, but since their main reason for staying on Cuiwei Star had been this, they surely wouldn't have missed such an event.

They probably had come in; it's just that their whereabouts were unknown.

In his spare moments Yang Kai would take out the Transmission Compass and pour his Divine Sense into it, hoping to contact Qian Tong and the others.

Unfortunately, over all those days the Transmission Compass had given no reply.

One day, while Yang Kai was sitting cross-legged in a secluded spot of the Blood Prison restoring his energy, he again took out the Transmission Compass to check.

He had not held out much hope, but when he poured his Divine Sense into it his expression brightened and he immediately began probing.

Qian Tong actually responded!

And he was even summoning his companions to his location.

He seemed to have discovered something extraordinary!
