## Chapter 1338 — Underground Dark River

While the others conversed, Fei Zhi Tu seemed to have discerned something; after rolling up the beast-skin map he gave a beckoning gesture and, in a blur of motion, darted into the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

"Heh heh, young friend, you go first—this old man will bring up the rear. Oh, and try not to resist the Imperial Might within the Fallen Emperor Mountains; quietly perceive it instead," Ning Xiangchen kindly reminded once more.

"Thanks for the reminder, Senior!" Yang Kai inclined his head lightly, then, together with Cai He, Du Sisi, and Lian Guang, charged into the Fallen Emperor Mountains.

After the four Saint King Realm practitioners entered, Ning Xiangchen and the three Origin Returning Realm elders brought up the rear.

Inside the Fallen Emperor Mountains one needn't worry about ferocious beasts or venomous snakes, but it is common to encounter maddened warriors who attack without rhyme or reason.

These cultivators came here to refine, yet for various reasons lingered too long; their minds were shattered by the Imperial Might, leaving them in a state of frenzy.

Every year countless fighters arrive here, and accidents happen frequently; besides that, some with ill intent use this place to ambush and plunder, doing all manner of despicable deeds.

Fortunately, among Yang Kai's party of eight there were four Origin Returning Realm masters, and an expert like Fei Zhi Tu leading them, so they needn't worry about such problems.

The moment he stepped into the Fallen Emperor Mountains, Yang Kai felt an invisible force envelop his body; under its influence his Saint Yuan circulation grew slightly sluggish, and when he released his Divine Sense he could only probe a few hundred zhang around him.

His Divine Sense had been suppressed to such an extent by the Imperial Might.

Yang Kai couldn't help but feel chilled; the Imperial Might was everywhere, as if a pair of unseen eyes watched his every move—an uncanny sensation of being observed.

This is only a trace of the Imperial Might! If the Starry Sky Emperor himself descended, how terrifying would that be?

At this point Yang Kai no longer doubted the Starry Sky Emperor's existence. The two Star Emperor Tokens he'd obtained were rumored to be left by the Starry Sky Emperor; Star Emperor Mountain's legends tied to that figure, and the Fallen Emperor Mountains was no different.

Rumors don't arise from nothing—it's likely the Starry Sky Emperor truly existed.

Faced with the Imperial Might, Yang Kai instinctively wanted to resist. But recalling Ning Xiangchen's kindly warning and seeing Cai He and the others remain calm, he held his breath and opened his mind to perceive it instead.

They were still at the outermost region; the Imperial Might here was not that strong, so even if one did not resist it posed little danger.

Following Fei Zhi Tu closely, they indeed encountered no cultivators; Fei Zhi Tu expertly guided them around the fields of vision and Divine Sense ranges of those who came to train here.

After all, this operation was highly secretive; Fei Zhi Tu did not want any unnecessary complications.

Their journey took two days.

As they delved deeper into the Fallen Emperor Mountains, the surrounding Imperial Might grew stronger, yet Yang Kai felt pleased rather than alarmed—after only two days he sensed his Divine Sense had strengthened, and the Sea of Consciousness had become clearer under the Imperial Might's subtle influence.

This truly was a fine place to cultivate Divine Sense; simply remaining here brought benefits. If one took time to cultivate Divine Sense or a Soul Technique here, the gains would be multiplied.

Unfortunately, the power of Imperial Might within the Fallen Emperor Mountain is only suitable for tempering a cultivator’s Divine Sense. Aside from that, it merely aids in condensing one’s own Shi, making its effects somewhat limited. Otherwise, this place would undoubtedly become a true Sacred Land of cultivation, and the great forces across Dark Star would likely wage war over its ownership.

After three more days Yang Kai began to feel weary. The Imperial Might purifies the Sea of Consciousness and strengthens Divine Sense, but this harsh, one-sided purification also pressures the cultivator; if one couldn't endure, their mind would be affected.

Yang Kai had fared well—he had not resisted the Imperial Might and followed Ning Xiangchen's advice, quietly perceiving the wonders within the imperial aura and gaining much.

The other three Saint King Realm fighters fared worse; as early as yesterday they had all, without agreement, activated their Divine Sense to slightly resist the imperial intrusion, and the contrast in Divine Sense cultivation became obvious.

This sight astonished Cai He and the others and caused Ning Xiangchen and the rest to click their tongues in wonder.

It must be noted that although Cai He and the others were each Third Stage of the Saint King Realm like Yang Kai, two of them excelled in arrays and the other specialized in puppetry techniques.

Either discipline demands terrifying Divine Sense—Lian Guang, when fighting, could command over a hundred puppets, each imbued with his Divine Sense. The requirement for Divine Sense in puppetry exceeds that of array research.

In short, these three should have had Divine Sense cultivation surpassing peers of the same rank.

Yet compared to Yang Kai, they were somewhat inferior.

How could they not be shocked? They silently wondered what methods Yang Kai had practiced to achieve such strong Divine Sense.

Yang Kai naturally didn’t know the hidden intricacies behind it. He only felt that if he tried to resist, the benefits he could gain here would diminish, so he opened his mind and body completely to comprehend the Imperial Might.

When Du Sisi noticed this, she instantly showed a trace of displeasure. Prideful since her cultivation of arrays, her Divine Sense strength had always exceeded same-rank cultivators; to be bested by Yang Kai stung her pride.

Gritting her teeth and steeling herself, she also dropped her Sea of Consciousness' defenses.

Only when her face turned slightly pale did Cai He realize something was wrong; he hurried forward to fuss over her, only to be brushed off and left smiling helplessly.

Ahead lay a marsh; Fei Zhi Tu stared solemnly at it, taking out the beast-skin map for comparison. After a moment he gave a low shout: "We're near—it's right here. Keep up."

Hearing him, everyone brightened and quickened their pace.

This marsh within the Fallen Emperor Mountains formed in a vast valley; no one knew how such a swamp came to be, but the miasma and muddy pools kept most cultivators away.

After all, those who come here seek to temper their Divine Sense and prefer comfortable spots for cultivation—who would choose such a place to suffer?

Following Fei Zhi Tu through uneven footing for half a day, he suddenly halted, staring at a vast pool and falling silent.

"Is it here?" Ning Xiangchen stepped forward, standing beside Fei Zhi Tu and asking.

"Mm. According to the message from Old Qian, it should be here, though we must make a small adjustment." Saying that, Fei Zhi Tu produced a bead and spat once, then tossed the bead into the center of the pool.

Under everyone’s watchful gaze, as the bead dropped into the puddle, the water immediately began to surge and ripple, as though something beneath the surface was stirring and agitating the entire pool.

White cold vapors rose, and within moments the temperature plummeted across a hundred zhang radius.

Crackle crackle...

Cracking sounds rang out as the great pool froze at a visible speed, leaving in its center a straight passage plunging downward—black and bottomless, its destination unknown.

Yang Kai sent out his Divine Sense but could not probe the bottom.

After a while, when the cracking ceased and the passage stabilized, Fei Zhi Tu called out: "Go down. Ning, you and the others stay at the rear; I'll take the youngsters first."

"All right." Ning Xiangchen nodded once.

Fei Zhi Tu glanced at Yang Kai and the others; seeing Du Sisi's pale face and cold sweat, his brow furrowed with displeasure. He could tell Du Sisi had been sulking and caused her own condition. This mission was crucial; had he not lacked a decent Formation Master, he would never have brought that girl along.

A burst of blue light flashed as Fei Zhi Tu used his Saint Yuan to envelop the four of them, then leapt into the passage.

After who knew how long Yang Kai estimated they had fallen at least a thousand zhang before landing, the sound of flowing streams reached his ears. Illuminated by that blue glow, he turned to look and discovered they were beside the channel of an underground dark river.

Upon arrival, the ever-present Imperial Might that had enveloped him vanished.

"An underground place like this?" Cai He clicked his tongue as he surveyed the surroundings, clearly surprised that the Fallen Emperor Mountains' depths hid such a wonder.

“Hmph. If ancient ruins were so easy to find, they’d have been ransacked long ago—Old Qian would never have gotten the chance,” Fei Zhi Tu snorted, glancing at Du Sisi. “Rest for a while. If something like this happens again, you won’t need to enter the ruins next time.”

Du Sisi bit her lip and nodded; prideful though she was, she did not dare defy Fei Zhi Tu.

After a time Ning Xiangchen and the others ventured down and the eight reunited; they took a brief rest.

Yang Kai stared toward a certain direction in silence. Whether it was illusion or not, he felt an age-old desolate aura emanating from that way—indescribable yet full of character.

Fei Zhi Tu noticed him staring and raised an eyebrow; the route they were about to take led that way, so he wondered if Yang Kai had sensed something.
