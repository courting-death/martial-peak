## Chapter 2486 — Great Emperor's Remains

The damaged Origin Power was already extremely difficult to refine and absorb, let alone a complete Origin Power. So for now, Yang Kai could only snatch it first and deal with it later when he had time.

After succeeding, Yang Kai immediately teleported away, vanishing without a trace.

Only at this moment did the group locked in battle realize that the Stellar Origin had disappeared. Looking around, they couldn’t see any sign of the thief, and they instantly flew into a rage, cursing furiously.

Meanwhile, Liu Yan, Zhang Ruoxi, and Mo Xiaoqi had already rushed toward another cluster of Stellar Origin.

Mo Xiaoqi no longer concealed her strength. Earlier, when she fought Lan Xun, she had only used her secret techniques and hadn’t even shown half of her true ability. Now, to compete for the Stellar Origin, she waved her hand and summoned an army of Demonic Beasts.

Silver-Maned Lion-Tiger Beast, Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat, Crimson Fire Qilin, Blue-Eyed Ink-Scaled Jiao...

All kinds of Demonic Beasts surrounded her, their roars rising and falling, charging forward with overwhelming momentum, frightening the martial artists ahead into dodging repeatedly.

Liu Yan’s White Tiger Puppet was also released. Although it was still somewhat inferior to a true Emperor, it was not something a Dao Origin Realm cultivator could contend with. The unique aura of the Emperor Realm it exuded made countless martial artists tremble in fear.

Although Zhang Ruoxi didn’t have powerful helpers, her own aura was extremely dense. No one knew what secret technique she activated, but she suddenly radiated a terrifying pressure. Not only did the nearby martial artists retreat, even Mo Xiaoqi’s Demonic Beasts shivered in fear.

Mo Xiaoqi glanced at Zhang Ruoxi suspiciously, shocked in her heart.

As the daughter of the Beast Great Emperor, Mo Xiaoqi was born able to communicate with Demonic Beasts. So at this moment, she could clearly sense the fear and terror of her beast pets.

Her beast pets all had extremely noble and pure bloodlines, many with the blood of Ancient Divine Spirits. Though thin, it was not something ordinary Demonic Beasts could compare to. All of them had been personally selected for her by the Beast Great Emperor.

Even when facing an Emperor, these beast pets could fight without the slightest fear.

Yet after Zhang Ruoxi released that unique aura, these beasts trembled uncontrollably, as if suppressed by something innate. A few even whimpered at Zhang Ruoxi.

Mo Xiaoqi was completely shocked. These whimpers meant they were trying to curry favor. Sometimes, when she threw a childish tantrum and ignored her pets, they would make these sounds to win her attention. It always worked.

But now, these beasts that wouldn’t flinch even before an Emperor were trying to please an unremarkable little girl.

What was going on?

Previously, Mo Xiaoqi hadn’t paid much attention to Zhang Ruoxi, since the latter rarely spoke and kept a low profile. But after this commotion, Mo Xiaoqi suddenly realized that Zhang Ruoxi seemed to be hiding some secret, and it was clearly related to Demonic Beasts.

Her heart was full of doubts, but it wasn’t convenient to ask. She could only keep her suspicions to herself and wait to investigate later.

Though the three women used different methods, together they were unstoppable. Wherever they went, everyone retreated.

In no time at all, they seized a cluster of Stellar Origin. No one knew what agreement they had, but Mo Xiaoqi grinned and put the Stellar Origin into her Spatial Ring.

Yang Kai watched them for a while from the side. Seeing that the three didn’t need his attention, he let go and joined the scramble with the others.

At this moment, the Origin Sea was boiling, with complete Stellar Origins constantly rising from below, and countless martial artists fighting fiercely for them.

Using his mastery of the Power of Space and the Star Refining Technique, Yang Kai flickered unpredictably. Whenever a new Stellar Origin appeared, he was first to arrive, snatching it and fleeing immediately.

The martial artists who tried to compete for the Stellar Origin didn’t even know what happened before the Origin was gone.

As time passed, Yang Kai roamed the Origin Sea alone, collecting more and more Stellar Origins.

His haul alone surpassed anyone else’s.

In such a chaotic scramble, speed was everything. With his mastery of the Power of Space and ability to teleport, he had an advantage no one else could match.

After half a day, the Stellar Origins emerging from the bottom of the Origin Sea became fewer and fewer. Each time one appeared, hundreds of people rushed for it.

In this situation, even Yang Kai found it hard to perform. After several attempts, he finally managed to snatch one from the crowd, leaving hundreds behind to argue and fight among themselves.

Another half day passed, and the sea gradually calmed. After waiting a long time, no more Stellar Origins appeared.

It seemed all the complete Stellar Origins had been taken.

Yet the bloody fighting continued. Anyone who had obtained a Stellar Origin became a target, and the Origin Sea echoed with screams. Countless elite martial artists died here, their blood dyeing the sea below red.

Yang Kai’s figure flickered a few times as he found Liu Yan and the others amid the chaos above the Origin Sea.

Perhaps because people feared the terrifying strength Liu Yan and the others had displayed, no one dared to target them, and the three remained unscathed.

When Yang Kai arrived, Mo Xiaoqi immediately ran over with a bright smile and called out, “Eldest Brother Yang, Eldest Brother Yang, we got so many Origins!”

As soon as she spoke, countless burning gazes shot over from all around.

Now, with thousands of martial artists gathered at the Origin Sea, only a small number had actually obtained a Stellar Origin. Most had never even seen a complete one.

So Mo Xiaoqi’s words undoubtedly touched a nerve.

Mo Xiaoqi clearly realized she’d said something wrong and stuck out her tongue.

Yang Kai swept his gaze around, snorted coldly, and unleashed his aura without reservation. With a boom, even the void seemed to tremble.

The martial artists eyeing Mo Xiaoqi hesitated, weighed their own strength, looked at Yang Kai’s group, and reluctantly withdrew their gazes.

Only then did Mo Xiaoqi whisper, “Each of us got two or three Stellar Origins.”

She looked excited, and Zhang Ruoxi and Liu Yan’s faces were also flushed, clearly very satisfied with their gains.

“Not bad, not bad!” Yang Kai nodded with a smile.

If each got two or three, that meant the three of them had seized at least seven or eight clusters. Such a harvest was already extremely rich. If they could find time to refine them, it would greatly benefit their future growth.

But by comparison, Yang Kai’s gains were even greater.

Though he hadn’t counted exactly, he had snatched at least thirty clusters of Stellar Origin by himself.

A single Cultivation Star would only produce one Origin. Over thirty clusters meant they came from over thirty Cultivation Stars.

And in just this one day, the Origin Sea had produced at least three or four hundred clusters of Stellar Origin.

In other words, the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor must have devoured at least three or four hundred Cultivation Stars back then to leave behind such a rich legacy after his death.

Such actions, such methods, were simply beyond description—utterly inhuman.

“This place isn’t safe. Since there are no more Stellar Origins, we should leave.” Yang Kai glanced around and frowned.

Mo Xiaoqi said, “I’ll follow Eldest Brother Yang.”

Yang Kai nodded. Just as he was about to lead them away, a sudden disturbance came from the Origin Sea below.

The crimson sea water seemed to be drawn by some force and began to swirl. In no time, the entire Origin Sea started spinning.

A subtle pulling force spread out, making all the martial artists above the Origin Sea change their expressions.

Everyone stared intently, and the sound of sharp inhales echoed all around.

At the center of the Origin Sea, a huge vortex gradually formed. As the sea spun, the crimson water poured into the vortex and disappeared, no one knew where it went.

The vortex seemed able to swallow the very void, making everyone who saw it feel their scalp tingle and their bodies go cold.

The water poured in faster and faster, more and more violently. In just a few breaths, the Origin Sea shrank by half.

After a while, the entire Origin Sea vanished, the water gone from the void, leaving only a black hole at the center.

Through that black hole, a skeleton could be vaguely seen inside, sitting cross-legged, deathly pale, clearly dead for countless years. If that was all, it wouldn’t be so strange, but on one finger of the skeleton, a Spatial Ring still remained.

Everyone saw this scene and froze, their burning gazes latching onto the Spatial Ring like leeches.

Gulp, gulp...

The sound of swallowing echoed out.

“What’s with this skeleton? Who died here?”

“Judging by the looks of it, this person has been dead for at least tens of thousands of years.”

“Tens of thousands of years... The battle of the Great Emperors was also tens of thousands of years ago. Five Great Emperors fell in that war.”

“This is the skeleton of a Great Emperor! That ring... it’s a Great Emperor’s Spatial Ring!”

Martial artists from all directions gathered near the black hole. In no time, the area was packed, and discussions buzzed from all sides.

Most were guessing which Great Emperor had left behind this skeleton.

Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart.

He had just heard from Lan Xun that the Origin Sea was where the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had fallen. Now, seeing a skeleton left behind from tens of thousands of years ago, he couldn’t help but speculate.

“Xiaoqi!” Yang Kai called softly, glancing at her for confirmation.

Mo Xiaoqi’s face turned a little pale. Nervous and excited, she said, “This is probably really that lord’s remains!”
