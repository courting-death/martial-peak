## Chapter 767 — The Wondrous Uses of Yang Liquid

Under everyone's eyes, Yang Kai walked up to the massive Divine Tree.

Gou Chi and An Ling'er both clenched their hands in secret, unsure what he had in mind.

Standing at the root of the Divine Tree, Yang Kai frowned slightly and slowly reached out, laying a hand on the thick trunk.

In an instant his body trembled.

The Divine Tree before him was like a vast treasure trove — it stored an enormous Yang attribute energy beyond reckoning, streaming ceaselessly along the veins inside the trunk, surging like a roaring river; if one listened closely, one could even hear the murmur of flowing water within.

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he thought that if such colossal energy could be his, how far he might leap in cultivation.

He quickly shook his head, however — after all, this was the Yang Clan's Divine Tree, and with so many experts present he could not simply absorb its energy; if he did, he would become a corpse the next moment.

As he observed, every one of the Yang Clan's experts had their Divine Sense locked onto him, as if any improper move would invite merciless annihilation.

Yang Kai, however, behaved sensibly and only probed.

After a long while, impatience showed on their faces, for the fluctuations from the Divine Tree remained chaotic and unstable with no change.

Yang Kai stopped wasting time, smashed the restriction in his Sea of Consciousness once more, let his spirit body slip out of his flesh, and dove into the tree's trunk.

A world of golden light spread out; his spirit body swam as if in a river of gold, the water entirely condensed Yang energy, and following the river's source Yang Kai moved upward.

Before long he arrived at a strange and wondrous place.

This was somewhere within the Divine Tree — strictly speaking, at the tree's heart.

Ahead, a distinct mass of energy sat quietly in the golden river. It radiated heat like the surrounding waters but differed from them in subtle ways.

Rhythmic undulations emanated from this mass, making it appear like a powerfully beating heart.

Watching it, Yang Kai's face showed astonishment.

He thought to himself, "So that's how it is!"

When he arrived and the tree's energy wound around him, he had felt something; seeing this mass confirmed his conjecture.

At the same time, he fully understood what lay behind the Divine Tree's convulsions and instability.

The Yang Clan folk did not know the reason and could only nourish the tree through blood sacrifices.

Yang Kai snorted softly and fixed his gaze ahead.

The energy continued to pulse, conveying to Yang Kai a message of craving.

The mass was in a chaotic state now, but Yang Kai believed that given enough time and nourishment, it could become a conscious entity.

In the Myriad Worlds, life takes countless, strange forms.

The True Spirit inside jade he had encountered before was one such lifeform; the Bone Race he had seen in the Ice Sect was another. This Divine Tree was itself a living body, and now it seemed poised to transform into yet another form of life.

From unconsciousness into consciousness!

The energy in the tree-heart was the gathering of its spirit; once it completed evolution, this mass would become the tree's soul convergence, its spirit body.

Yang Kai felt stunned — he had never imagined a simple tree could reach such a stage.

The tree's instability and convulsions were not due to sickness or impending death, but because this evolution demanded vast energy and nourishment.

Rooted here, it could not draw sufficient nutrients, and whenever it needed more it convulsed unconsciously, so after someone was used in a blood sacrifice the tree would calm for a time.

Once fed, it would naturally be steady.

But that method treated only the symptom; when its hunger returned, it would again present situations that left the Yang Clan helpless.

The energy required for evolution was too enormous, and from the frequency of its convulsions Yang Kai secretly thought the tree wasn't far from succeeding.

As he pondered, Yang Kai quickly pieced together the situation, though he did not know how much the Yang Clan understood of it.

In theory, if they sent a spirit body in to investigate they would also understand, but judging from how nervous and uneasy they reacted to the tree's convulsions, they seemed not to grasp the reason.

Yang Kai was puzzled and could not understand.

This matter needed to be asked about in detail!

With that thought he hastened to withdraw his spirit body and return to his own flesh.

No sooner had he opened his eyes than the Yang Clan experts' accusations and angry shouts rang in his ears; they seemed very impatient and at any moment would sacrifice Gou Chi and his companions.

"What's the hurry?" Yang Kai cast them a sidelong glance and said coolly, "I've got some leads. Wait a bit longer."

The Yang Clan leader glared at Yang Kai with ill intent and said coldly, "I'll give you half a cup of tea of time. If you still can't settle the tree, every one of you dies here today!"

"Half a cup of tea..." Yang Kai chuckled lightly. "Should be enough."

With that he vaulted into the air and slipped into the dense leaves, vanishing from sight. The Yang Clan did not worry — though they could not see him, with Divine Senses locked on, they were not afraid of tricks.

On a massive trunk Yang Kai estimated the distance and judged the spot he occupied to be where his spirit had seen the mass of energy.

He drew a finger and cut a fissure into the trunk.

At once a drop of Yang Liquid burst from his fingertip and fell into the crack.

The Yang Liquid seeped in and disappeared.

Waiting silently, Yang Kai's heart beat erratically; he had little confidence.

What he did now was merely a try; he could not be certain it would take effect.

He remembered that when he was very weak he had used his Yang Liquid to cultivate Yang-attribute spirit herbs and trees, and he knew his Yang Liquid promoted growth with very marked results.

Spirit herbs and trees that normally needed years to mature required only a drop or two of Yang Liquid to grow within half a month to a month.

Since this Divine Tree needed energy to evolve, feeding it Yang Liquid was unquestionably the best option. Besides, Yang Kai's current drop was far different from before — the energy it contained was orders of magnitude greater.

Perhaps it would satisfy the tree's demand!

But it was only perhaps; if it failed, Yang Kai would have to risk everything.

During the anxious wait his heart rose, not from fear of fighting the Yang Clan but from anticipation; he hoped his Yang Liquid would take effect and he was eager to see what the tree would be like when it evolved into a conscious form.

Suddenly the tree's already unstable pulses became even more chaotic and violent, as if provoked; Yang attribute energy ran rampant and hot gales rose across the plains.

"Kid, what did you do?" someone among the waiting Yang Clan bellowed, and flew up to deal with Yang Kai.

"Wait!" the Yang Clan leader waved him off, frowning as he probed carefully with his Divine Sense.

"Leader, that brat must've tampered with the tree — let me kill him!"

"I said wait!" the leader swept him with an austere glance and the man fell silent.

On the trunk Yang Kai heard them below and was not the least flustered; instead he showed a pleased expression.

The Divine Tree indeed craved Yang Liquid. Its convulsions were not from discomfort but because it had tasted something delicious and was unconsciously begging for more.

The crack Yang Kai had cut into the trunk had, to his surprise, split open further on its own.

The tree seemed to think this would bring it greater benefit.

Its consciousness was in a chaotic, bewildered state, like a fetus growing and sensing the outside but unable to distinguish details; the fissure opening by itself was a direct reflection of that awareness.

Yang Kai grinned and dropped another drop of Yang Liquid from his fingertip into the trunk.

After a moment, the tree's convulsing aura abruptly became much more stable.

At this, odd expressions spread across the faces of the Yang Clan below; even the leader was moved, a cold, sharp light flashing in his keen eyes.

As time passed, the tree's aura seemed smoothed by an invisible hand, gradually calming until it was untroubled.

They waited beneath for a long while before seeing Yang Kai leap down, his face pale.

After landing he sat cross-legged without a word and silently circulated his profound arts.

No one dared disturb him; even the Yang Clan held their breath, quietly waiting to see what method had allowed him to soothe the tree's convulsions.

Gou Chi and An Ling'er glanced aside and secretly breathed a sigh of relief — they knew they had narrowly escaped disaster this time.

Much later Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes; though his face was a little flushed, anyone could see he was extremely weak and his True Yuan seemed utterly spent.

His expression was extremely sullen; he did not look pleased.

Yang Kai was indeed in a bad mood — to feed the tree he had expended twenty drops of Yang Liquid just to barely calm it.

It was a huge loss.

"Kid, what method did you use?" the Yang Clan leader hurriedly asked. "How could you calm the tree?"

"Do you think I'd tell you?" Yang Kai sneered.

"Ingrate! If you don't say, we'll make you endure torments like no human has known!" someone immediately threatened.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, unruffled and fearless: "Doesn't matter. This calming was only temporary. If you refuse to truly solve the tree's problem, go ahead and strike me down. I guarantee you — even if I lose a single hair, the next time the tree has trouble I will stand by and watch!"
