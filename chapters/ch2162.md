## Chapter 2162 — The Stairway of Time

Guided by the light ahead, Yang Kai quickened his pace.

Before long, he passed through that great door.

What greeted his eyes was a long, unbroken stairway of white jade, pure and flawless, stretching upward without end. Its length was unknown, and its end could not be seen, not even with Divine Sense.

At the base of this white jade stairway, to Yang Kai’s right, stood a stone stele, upon which a line of large characters was engraved.

Yang Kai looked down and read aloud, “Stairway of Time?”

He looked utterly confused, frowning, unsure what mysteries this stairway of white jade might hold. He dared not advance rashly, lest he encounter some danger.

Fortunately, there was no one else here. After a moment’s thought, he summoned Hua Qingsi.

After all, Hua Qingsi was a disciple of Star God Palace and had long prepared for the Four Seasons Land. She should know more about this Time Temple than he did.

With a flash of light, Hua Qingsi’s figure appeared.

She looked around in confusion at first, seeming unsure where she was.

"This is the Time Temple!" Yang Kai called out.

“Ah?” Hua Qingsi responded in surprise, then her face lit up with joy. “You really found the Time Temple?”

"Yes, by a stroke of luck, it appeared of its own accord." Yang Kai said, "Take a look at this first…"

As he spoke, Yang Kai pointed ahead at the white jade stairway and the stone stele beside him.

Hua Qingsi glanced at the stele, her delicate body trembling. “The Stairway of Time?”

"So you do know about it…" Seeing her reaction, Yang Kai immediately understood she must know something about the Stairway of Time. He quickly said, "Tell me, what's special about it?"

Hua Qingsi took a deep breath, calming her excitement. In a solemn voice, she said, “The Stairway of Time is said to contain the Great Emperor of Time’s comprehension and mastery of the Power Of Time. Those who ascend it can have their bodies washed by the Power Of Time, which is of immense benefit to cultivators!”

Her eyes sparkled, and she looked eager to try.

“What if you fail?” Yang Kai frowned.

Hua Qingsi was taken aback. After hesitating for a while, she said, “I don’t know… There will probably be some terrible consequences.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. It seemed Hua Qingsi didn’t know much more about the Stairway of Time than he did, but she was still better informed.

Seeing Yang Kai deep in thought, Hua Qingsi pursed her red lips and said, “Whether you go up or not, I want to give it a try!”

Yang Kai glanced at her and smiled. “Since it’s a rare opportunity, we can’t miss it. Hmm… Let’s call Ruoxi out as well.”

As he spoke, he summoned Zhang Ruoxi.

After explaining the wonders of the Stairway of Time to Zhang Ruoxi, Yang Kai looked at her and said, “It’s up to you whether you want to go up. Although I don’t know what the consequences of failure are, they probably won’t be pleasant. But don’t worry, if it comes to that, I’ll put you into the Small Xuan Realm.”

“I want to go!” To Yang Kai’s surprise, Zhang Ruoxi showed no hesitation or doubt after hearing this. Instead, she responded with great enthusiasm.

Hua Qingsi smiled and said, “The little girl may be young, but she’s got plenty of spirit…”

“In that case, let’s go together.” Yang Kai nodded and solemnly reminded, “Don’t stray too far from me. If anything happens, I might not have time to put you into the Small Xuan Realm.”

Zhang Ruoxi nodded nervously, her face flushed with excitement. Hua Qingsi, however, smiled charmingly and said, “Then you’d better follow right behind your elder sister…”

Yang Kai shot her a glance, snorted, and stepped onto the white jade stairway.

Seeing this, Hua Qingsi and Zhang Ruoxi both straightened their expressions and stepped up together.

Suddenly, a pure white energy surged from the white jade stairway, turning into mist that enveloped their feet, making them feel as if they were walking on clouds.

At the same time, Yang Kai’s body trembled. He suddenly felt a strange power pour into him, like a catalyst, washing over his Origin Qi and the Divine Sense in his Sea of Consciousness, making both more powerful and condensed.

This power was indescribable, as if time itself was passing by. As the years flowed, his strength steadily increased.

Though it was only an instant, the three of them felt as if a long time had passed.

A wondrous feeling lingered in their hearts.

Yang Kai glanced to either side and saw that Zhang Ruoxi and Hua Qingsi both looked perfectly fine. Confirming they were unharmed, he took another step forward.

The sensation grew even stronger. Yang Kai’s spirit was shaken, and he opened his mind to accept the cleansing of time’s power from the stairway. His Origin Qi and Divine Sense became increasingly powerful and refined.

At first, Yang Kai still had the presence of mind to check on Hua Qingsi and Zhang Ruoxi, lest they be unable to withstand the Power Of Time and something happen. But as he climbed higher, he gradually became immersed in this slow yet rapid feeling of growing stronger, unable to pull himself out for a while.

“So this is the Power Of Time?” Yang Kai raised his brows in admiration. “What a strange force! Though only a short time has passed, it feels as if I’ve spent ages cultivating… This peculiar power is even more remarkable than Spatial Force.”

Just as his mind was racing, he suddenly sensed an unusual fluctuation of power from ahead.

Yang Kai jolted, collected his thoughts, and looked up. He saw Zhang Ruoxi several steps ahead, walking forward one step at a time, her clothes soaked with sweat, revealing her graceful figure.

As she took that step, a wave of energy burst from her petite body, spreading out with a boom.

“Are you kidding me!” Yang Kai nearly popped his eyes out.

He had no idea when Zhang Ruoxi had gotten ahead of him, let alone by so many steps. But more importantly, she had just broken through a Stage, reaching the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, Yang Kai would never have believed it.

After all, Zhang Ruoxi had only just broken through to the Origin Returning Realm a few days ago. Now, in such a short time, she had advanced another Stage. It was simply unbelievable.

Although Yang Kai himself had gained much on the Stairway of Time, it was nothing compared to Zhang Ruoxi’s progress.

This little girl really is strange! Yang Kai recalled the day she advanced to the Origin Returning Realm, when that giant figure appeared behind her. He was utterly baffled. He truly had no idea what was special about her bloodline that allowed her to advance so quickly.

Yang Kai opened his mouth, wanting to call out to Zhang Ruoxi so she wouldn’t get too far ahead, but found he couldn’t utter a single word. Even his Divine Sense couldn’t leave his body; whenever he tried, it was immediately suppressed.

He looked back and saw Hua Qingsi about six or seven steps behind, drenched in sweat and struggling to move forward, looking utterly exhausted.

The Stairway of Time truly wasn’t a test of cultivation level. If it were, Hua Qingsi should have been in the lead, not the lowest-ranked Zhang Ruoxi.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then stopped to wait for Hua Qingsi. In his view, she would be the first to reach her limit. He had to be ready to put her into the Small Xuan Realm at the right moment!

As for Zhang Ruoxi, Yang Kai could always catch up to her later.

And indeed, things went just as Yang Kai expected.

When they were about halfway up the Stairway of Time, Hua Qingsi finally couldn’t withstand the cleansing any longer. What had been beneficial at first now became torment. The erosion of time’s power made her feel as if her youth was slipping away, and she panicked, looking up at Yang Kai, wanting to call out.

But at that critical moment, she couldn’t utter a single word, and sweat poured from her body in anxiety.

Fortunately, Yang Kai had been watching her closely. As soon as he noticed, he quickly reached out and put her into the Small Xuan Realm.

At this point, when Yang Kai looked up again, he could only vaguely see Zhang Ruoxi’s back. The little girl had left him dozens of steps behind and seemed completely absorbed in the benefits she was receiving, never stopping as she continued upward.

Seeing this, Yang Kai dared not slack off and climbed with all his might, trying to close the distance between himself and Zhang Ruoxi.

…

Elsewhere in the Time Temple, in a vast, pitch-black hall, the sounds of deep breathing and a powerful heartbeat echoed faintly. An inexplicable pressure filled the hall. If any living being entered, they would surely collapse to the ground at once. The pressure was as heavy as a mountain, enough to make even those of the Emperor Realm tremble in fear.

Suddenly, two narrow red lights flared in the darkness. Accompanied by a heavy exhalation, the two beams of light widened abruptly—they were a pair of eyes as large as bronze gongs.

These were the wild, murderous eyes of a beast, with golden irises and red pupils, radiating boundless ferocity.

“Oh? Have these little bugs finally found the Time Temple?” A thunderous voice echoed through the dark hall. As it spoke, dazzling flames suddenly burst forth from the darkness.

The flames came from a strange giant beast wreathed in fire. It stood as tall as a three-story building, resembling both a tiger and an ox, as if forged from pure flame. A crimson horn jutted from its forehead, twin wings sprouted from its back, and its body was covered in scales, exuding an awe-inspiring presence.

“Looks like this Lord’s task is almost complete… How many years has it been… This Lord is finally about to be free!” The voice that shook the entire hall came from the beast’s belly. It straightened up, its twin pupils scanning the surroundings as if they could pierce the void.

As it looked around, it muttered, “Let this Lord see what’s so special about these little bugs.”

Wherever its gaze swept, not one of the dozens of cultivators within the Time Temple escaped its scrutiny. As it watched, it muttered commentary to itself: “Mm, this one’s aptitude is decent, but… hmph, still not enough to catch this Lord’s eye. Huh… this little girl is a bit interesting—good physique. Her cultivation isn’t high, yet she actually carries an Imperial Treasure. A descendant of some Great Emperor, perhaps? Mm, she barely meets the criteria, but… forget it. Great Emperors are nothing good to tangle with.”
