## Chapter 1712 — Forced Break-In

Sha Hu burst out laughing and waved his hand dismissively. “No need for you to go. Without tempering your bodies with Huntian Pills, you’d only be marching to your deaths. This time, Yang Kai and I will go — the rest of you can just stay back and enjoy the show.”

"Sect Master Yang?" Pang Zhen glanced suspiciously toward the stern where Yang Kai stood and murmured, "Sect Master Yang is indeed a man among dragons; I once sparred with him and was no match, but... he only arrived on Ghost Isle recently. What help can he possibly offer Senior Uncle?"

He had no doubt about Yang Kai's strength, but that had been shown on the Wuyou Sea; from what had happened to him and Qian Mo, it was clear that a powerful fighter outside did not necessarily remain powerful here.

Any warrior who had lived on Ghost Isle even a few years could be toyed with at will by those who had been there longer.

So when Sha Hu said he would only take Yang Kai along, Pang Zhen felt uneasy.

Sha Hu merely smiled wryly. "What do you know? Even I am no match for him. Do you think he can help?"

"Ah?" Pang Zhen's mouth gaped wide enough to fit an egg; his face was full of shock — he almost thought he had misheard.

He looked back at Yang Kai standing at the stern and saw Yang Kai smiling innocently. Pang Zhen couldn't help but shiver.

"Don't doubt it — the boy is indeed stronger than I am. A month ago I tried a move on him and was repelled by a single palm. As for now..." Sha Hu did not continue, but Pang Zhen read the unspoken implication.

Sha Hu's meaning was plain: a month earlier he had been driven back by Yang Kai's palm. Now he was likely even less able to withstand him.

Pang Zhen grew increasingly stunned.

They had all been trapped on Ghost Isle together for months; in that time none of them had advanced even a bit. They had been ordered about by Ghost Isle's warriors, made to do meaningless tasks. Yet Yang Kai had been able to defeat Sha Hu, who had lived on the isle for three hundred years.

Was this boy a monster?

The boat was small, but it sailed steadily on the sea, with the little dolphin occasionally giving it a push from behind so the speed was not slow.

In just five days they could see Ghost Isle in the distance.

"You all stay here and wait. After I finish, I'll fetch you up." Sha Hu ordered, then casually tossed a bottle of Huntian Pills to Pang Zhen. "One pill each — absorb and refine it."

Pang Zhen received it with delight.

He had long coveted the Huntian Pills on Ghost Isle. He knew the reason Ghost Isle's warriors were stronger was because of these spiritual pills. Unfortunately he had never found a way to obtain them.

Originally they would have to formally join Ghost Isle to have the qualification to receive a few Huntian Pills from the Island Lord after completing tasks. That process could take ages; most might die for one reason or another before then, and even if they did receive pills the amounts would be small and the quality low.

Yet now Sha Hu had tossed him a bottle.

Pang Zhen thanked him respectfully and did not delay; he opened the cap and gave one pill to each disciple of the Sea Hall.

Qian Mo watched greedily at the side, heart aching and bitter, when at the corner of her eye she suddenly noticed something flying toward her. She reached out and caught it in her palm.

Looking up, she found Yang Kai smiling at her. He said, "You should each have one as well."

Qian Mo blinked and snorted coldly, "I'll repay you for this when I return as the Commander."

"We'll see later." Yang Kai smiled, then followed Sha Hu as they rushed toward Ghost Isle.

The little dolphin let out a strange cry from behind, as if warning Yang Kai to be careful all the way.

Giving Qian Mo a bottle of Huntian Pills was not a whim for Yang Kai; he knew that even if he hadn't gifted it, the little dolphin would have asked him for it. It was obviously close to Qian Mo and would naturally think of her.

Most of the Huntian Lotuses in Yang Kai's hand had been found with the little dolphin's help; in that sense the little dolphin deserved half the credit for both the Huntian Lotus and the Huntian Pill. One bottle of Huntian Pills meant little to Yang Kai.

Ahead, Sha Hu slowed his pace, clearly waiting for Yang Kai.

Only after Yang Kai drew level with him did Sha Hu’s expression turn grave. “Yang Kai,” he said solemnly, “my purpose on this trip is simply to kill the traitor Ming Yue. Ming Yue is the strongest on Ghost Isle, but there are still several other formidable foes — when the time comes I’ll need you to help me sweep through their ranks.”

"No problem." Yang Kai agreed readily, then asked, "How confident are you of defeating Ming Yue, Elder Sha?"

Sha Hu's expression turned serious; he thought for a moment before answering, "At least sixty percent. Although I haven't met Ming Yue in a century, his strength must have grown. But with those inferior Huntian Pills, he could not have improved much. I have some confidence I can finish him with my palm."

"Then I wish you victory, Elder Sha," Yang Kai said with a grin.

Sha Hu brimmed with spirit. Ever since taking the Huntian Pills refined by Yang Kai, his strength, which had long stagnated, had risen steadily. Though still not as great as Yang Kai's, to others he was already formidable.

Compared to the Huntian Pills Yang Kai produced, Sha Hu thought the ones he had taken before were dogshit: low quality, hard to refine, with muddled and impure medicinal power. While they improved the body's constitution they also brought hidden dangers. Those hazards might not show short-term, but long-term consumption would surely cause problems.

Without the advantage of the Huntian Pills, Ming Yue was nothing in Sha Hu’s eyes.

The two sped forward; in a short while they arrived at Ghost Isle and, looking toward the city at the center of the island, Sha Hu sneered and accelerated, leaving only a trailing afterimage.

Yang Kai followed leisurely, right behind Sha Hu without falling back.

Youhun City was the only city on Ghost Isle; within it seven to eight thousand warriors survived, and it was the isle's sole living stronghold. The city had been built long ago; the ancient walls bore the marks of time. Almost every warrior cast ashore on Ghost Isle eventually came to this city.

The highest position in Youhun City was held by the Island Lord Ming Yue, followed by his trusted lieutenants who managed the whole isle and controlled the flow of Huntian Pills.

Those living on Ghost Isle who wanted Huntian Pills had to submit to Ming Yue's rule.

At the city gate, four or five armored warriors inspected passersby. Any warrior returning from the sea had to hand over half of their gains before being allowed entry.

The most precious Huntian Lotuses were confiscated entirely; none were allowed to be kept privately. Any who dared hoard Huntian Lotuses faced the harshest punishment.

Teams of exhausted warriors who had returned from the sea queued outside the city gate, preparing to enter Youhun City.

Many of them were wounded, some missing limbs, looking utterly miserable — clearly they had encountered sea-beasts while at sea and suffered heavy losses.

As the armored men inspected the spoils of those waiting to enter, a shout rose from the crowd. The lead guard frowned and, about to scold, suddenly sensed something and turned to look toward the distance.

There, two figures were rapidly approaching Youhun City like lightning, each dragging a long afterimage behind them. Only after they had closed the distance of one hundred zhang did the trailing images begin to fade.

The lead guard gasped and signaled his comrades. They drew their secret treasures and formed a barrier before the gate.

As the two figures neared, one of the guards shouted aloud, "Who goes there? Stop at once!"

"Get lost!" came a fierce roar, and the two figures — one leading, one following — charged through the gate and into Youhun City.

Those still queuing to enter were thrown into an uproar and displayed expressions of disbelief and doubt.

Ghost Isle's control was so severe that few dared to force their way into the city — many had never seen such a thing in years — yet now they witnessed it with their own eyes and many silently mourned the two intruders.

They felt the two were doomed; to provoke Ming Yue's authority in Youhun City was to invite certain death without burial.

Before they could finish that thought, a sickening explosion sounded; turning, they saw the lead armored guard had burst apart, leaving a pool of blood and scattered flesh where he stood.

The onlookers felt a chill from head to toe and fell silent; none of them had noticed when the guard had been struck.

At the same time, a thunderous roar echoed through the city: "Ming Yue, get out here!"

The shout was earth-shattering and deafening; many people went pale.

Yet there were always those who thrived on chaos — after a moment of stunned silence, their faces lit with excitement as they flocked toward the source of the voice, eager to see which audacious fool dared to call out Ming Yue’s name so brazenly within Ghost City.

The whole city erupted into chaos. At Sha Hu's roar countless warriors converged toward where he stood.

In no time over two thousand people had gathered around, and the numbers were still rising.

Sha Hu stood quietly on a street in Youhun City, hands behind his back, expression indifferent.

Yang Kai was one pace behind him, looking bored as he surveyed the surroundings.

The city looked passable — somewhat dilapidated, but in this grim place the fact that people had managed to create a living stronghold was noteworthy.

Near the streets there were even some shops selling daily necessities.

But now the shops were deserted; under Sha Hu's overwhelming aura no one dared linger — they had all fled far away.

Whispers spread around; many pointed at Yang Kai and Sha Hu, some gloating, some coldly watching, some itching to act, faces showing varied expressions.
