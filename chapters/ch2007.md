## Chapter 2007 — Earth Vein Pearl

Heavy Earth and Weak Water were treasures of the same rank; both were unimaginably heavy and each possessed its own properties. Ordinary martial artists rarely saw them, and even those of profound cultivation found it extremely difficult to encounter such treasures.

Mo Xiaoqi had a Weak Water Pearl, which seemed to have been forged from Weak Water itself; on that day in Yuqing Mountain she had used the Weak Water Pearl's power to bind that Luan Feng cub.

The Luan Feng was an Ancient Divine Spirit; even a cub was not to be trifled with. The many deaths on Yuqing Mountain that day were the best proof, and once the beast had been sealed by the Weak Water Pearl and was powerless to struggle free, the pearl's might became evident.

Mo Xiaoqi's background was not small, so it was not surprising she possessed a Weak Water Pearl.

And Heavy Earth was a presence that ranked alongside Weak Water.

In some respects it was even more rare and precious than Weak Water.

Because Heavy Earth was not only unimaginably heavy, but wherever it existed it produced a natural gravity field. Martial artists could train within it, and it could be refined into all manner of treasures. Any Secret Treasure that incorporated some Heavy Earth would grow much heavier and become extraordinarily solid, not easily destroyed.

Moreover, Heavy Earth had certain wondrous properties: if it were used to fashion an alchemical furnace or a refining furnace, those cauldrons could increase the chances of success when refining pills or forging artifacts.

Alchemists and artificers were frenzied in their pursuit of Heavy Earth.

Not only that, because Heavy Earth possessed rich spiritual essence and an earth attribute aura, planting Spiritual Objects on Heavy Earth could greatly shorten their growth cycles.

In other words, a Spiritual Herb that normally took a hundred years to mature might, when planted on Heavy Earth, ripen in ten years, five years, or even much less.

Such a supreme treasure drew countless martial artists and aroused the envy and covetousness of the great sects.

Which sect did not have its own medicinal garden? Each sect's garden cultivated large numbers of Spiritual Herbs and wondrous medicines; the rarer the medicine, the more horrific the growth cycle—decades or a century might be short, centuries or a thousand years were common, and some took several thousand years to mature.

These long‑growth medicines were generally beyond the cultivation capability of an individual martial artist. They did not have the time or energy; only sects possessed that power, and even then they had to invest massive time.

But once one possessed Heavy Earth, the situation changed completely.

A sufficient quantity of Heavy Earth might allow an acre of medicinal garden to continuously produce various Spiritual Herbs and wondrous medicines. If run well, it could push a Shi force up another level!

Unfortunately, the rarity of Heavy Earth also bred despair.

The few Heavy Earth pieces that occasionally appeared in the world were often used to forge Secret Treasures, leaving none available for medicinal gardens.

Yang Kai knew about Heavy Earth because he had been cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword.

The Undying Five Elements Sword required Five Elements Treasures to advance, so he paid close attention to treasures of the Five Elements. Heavy Earth was unquestionably the supreme soil treasure of the Earth attribute! In some respects it was even more precious than the Sun's True Essence and comparable to the Warm Spirit Lotus.

Even a pigeon‑egg‑sized chunk of Heavy Earth, though enough to refine several Secret Treasures, was not something Yang Kai would be satisfied with.

He believed there must be more Heavy Earth deep beneath the gorge; otherwise how could the gravity field here be so terrifying?

After thinking for a moment, he set the Heavy Earth down, then took from his Spatial Ring a handful of recovery Spiritual Pills, placed them in his palm and offered them to the little beast.

The little beast had been exhausted, scarcely able to move, but at the sight of the pills its eyes brightened; it opened its small mouth and swallowed them all.

Crunch, crunch……

The pills were like candy beans, and the little beast chewed them with a crisp snap.

"Want Spiritual Pills? I have plenty." Yang Kai smiled faintly, waved his hand and produced a dozen or so jade vials.

The beast's eyes grew even brighter.

"Good. Help me fetch that thing from underground, and you'll have as many Spiritual Pills as you want!" Yang Kai chuckled, pointed at the Heavy Earth and tempted it with profit.

The little beast rolled its eyes, plainly very tempted; after a moment it chirped twice in response to Yang Kai.

Inside the Xuan Realm Pearl the gravity field had no effect, so Yang Kai and the little beast recovered very quickly while meditating, and with those Spiritual Pills, in only two hours the beast was once again full of vigor.

Yang Kai then took it and reappeared in the gorge.

After another hour the little beast dug out from underground; Yang Kai, quick of eye and hand, brought it back to the Xuan Realm Pearl to recuperate.

A moment later Yang Kai was pleased to have obtained another pigeon‑egg‑sized chunk of Heavy Earth!

This kept repeating in cycles.

After five days the pile of Heavy Earth before Yang Kai had grown to the size of a tabletop and was three fingers thick.

Such a quantity of Heavy Earth was horrifying. One only needed a fingernail‑sized piece to elevate a Secret Treasure by a rank, and such items were priceless. A tabletop‑sized, three‑finger‑thick slab of Heavy Earth would make even the Ten Great Emperors envious and prompt them to seize it regardless of status.

Yang Kai finally believed that the interior of the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda truly was an ancient land.

If it were not so, where would such treasures come from?

It was also thanks to the gorge's special terrain and terrifying gravity field; otherwise such boons would not have fallen to him and would long since have been taken by others.

Any who passed through the gorge and discovered the anomaly would have already fallen and been killed; only he, by using the Xuan Realm Pearl, had escaped disaster and ultimately reaped great rewards.

He really should have thought of it earlier; the abnormality beneath the gorge was so obvious—aside from Heavy Earth, what else could trigger such effects?

The little beast was still busy outside, but by now the gorge's gravity field had weakened to nearly negligible levels. After all, most of the Heavy Earth had been transferred into Yang Kai's Xuan Realm Pearl, and the gravity that Heavy Earth produced had naturally vanished.

So Yang Kai had no need to worry about the beast's safety.

At that moment, with a thought he gathered up all the Heavy Earth lying before him.

If he had left it outside he absolutely could not have done this—probably only an Emperor Realm cultivator could have managed such a feat.

But here was the Small Xuan Realm, the internal space of the Xuan Realm Pearl, and the Xuan Realm Pearl was Yang Kai's Secret Treasure. After a period of refinement, here Yang Kai could exercise dominion over everything.

Even so, carrying so much Heavy Earth while flying was still extremely strenuous.

With difficulty he brought the Heavy Earth close to the medicinal garden. Yang Kai looked at the empty garden and smiled knowingly, then performed a technique to bury the Heavy Earth into the soil.

In this way he had a heaven‑defying medicinal garden; in future, if he saw the seedlings of heaven‑and‑earth treasures he could transplant them here to shorten their growth cycles. As long as they were not those Spiritual Objects that died immediately upon transplant, he need not worry about survival.

Of course, Yang Kai left a small piece of Heavy Earth behind to use in cultivating his Undying Five Elements Sword.

After inspecting his gains, Yang Kai was greatly satisfied, then his figure flickered and he vanished from the spot.

When he reappeared he was already beneath the gorge.

Without the gravity field, the dense Spiritual Qi under the gorge was no longer restrained and flowed upward.

There was no sign of the little beast; it should still be busy underground.

Heavy Earth was so rare that Yang Kai naturally did not want to miss a single bit, so he had the little beast search underground; finding more would be excellent, and if it could not, it did not matter—his haul this time was already ample.

He walked on and soon came before a set of bones, taking the Spatial Ring that lay in the skeleton's hand.

It was unclear what had died here; the flesh was long gone, leaving only white bones and a Spatial Ring.

A dead man's goods were of course not something Yang Kai would leave behind.

After searching, Yang Kai surprisingly recovered more than fifty Spatial Rings beneath the gorge.

In other words, more than fifty people had accidentally fallen and died here, and most of them should have been Void King Realm martial artists. Aside from those who had died recently, the remaining ones were likely all disciples of the Star God Palace.

After a brief inspection Yang Kai felt somewhat moved.

Indeed, they were disciples of the Star God Palace: each ring contained abundant wealth, not only large amounts of Source Crystals but also some Secret Treasures and Spiritual Pills.

Unfortunately some rings were too old and broken, making their contents impossible to retrieve, and some items, even when extracted, had lost much of their spiritual efficacy and were useless.

Yang Kai kept what was useful and discarded what was not.

He instantly acquired more than three hundred thousand Lower‑Level Source Crystals and over five thousand Middle‑Level Source Crystals; no Upper‑Level Source Crystals were seen. As for Void King‑Grade Secret Treasures, he obtained thirty or forty items, and there were even two Dao Origin‑Grade pieces.

This moved Yang Kai to reflection.

The last time he had secretly sold many Spiritual Pills on the black market he had gotten less than two hundred thousand Source Crystals; now, merely a single trip beneath the gorge had yielded such enormous gains.

It immediately resolved his pressing shortage of funds.

After ensuring nothing had been missed, Yang Kai stood in place, satisfied, and waited.

Not long after, the little beast dug out from somewhere and flew to Yang Kai. It opened its mouth and spat some things out.

Yang Kai looked and, seeing no Heavy Earth, felt somewhat disappointed.

But upon closer inspection of those items he brightened with joy.

"Earth Vein Pearls? There are so many Earth Vein Pearls?"

This time everything the little beast had gathered from underground turned out to be Earth Vein Pearls!

Earth Veins were products formed when the world's Spiritual Qi grew concentrated to a certain degree; the headquarters of sects were invariably established where Earth Veins existed so they could guarantee places for their disciples to cultivate.

The stronger the sect, the better the Earth Vein it would occupy; small sects and minor schools could only secure somewhat inferior Earth Veins.

Each year many sects and families fought fiercely over lands possessing Earth Veins, leaving countless dead and wounded.
