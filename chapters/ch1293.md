## Chapter 1293 — Corpse Soldier

Inside Zangxiong Valley, Yang Yan stood in place, staring at the two torn map fragments in her hand, her expression wavering — those two scraps had led them here, but there was no further clue.

That she had managed to gropingly reach this far with only two map fragments was a testament to Yang Yan's skill, yet no matter how she tried she couldn’t determine the final location the scraps pointed to; she only knew it lay somewhere within a thousand-li radius.

A thousand li — not exactly vast, but not small either; if one were searching for an especially concealed spot, it would take a great deal of time.

Delving this deep, the formations and sealing arrays hadn’t posed much of a difficulty for her, but the overwhelmingly thick yin energy here continuously gnawed at her Saint Yuan; fortunately Yang Kai’s Saint Yuan reserves were vast and could support her at every moment, otherwise the two would have long since been forced to retreat.

“What should we do?” Yang Yan turned to Yang Kai. Having come this far, she naturally didn’t want to give up — perhaps if they pushed a bit more they could find where the fragments led — but that depended on Yang Kai’s decision.

Yang Kai frowned and pondered. Though they hadn’t met great danger on the way, in the past two days the yin-souls they encountered had already reached strength comparable to the Saint King Realm, and some of those yin-souls, nourished by the constant yin energy, had even developed a degree of awareness, each one stubborn and hard to deal with: once they detected something wrong they would retreat, recover for a while, then come at them with renewed vigor. If not for Yang Kai’s endless array of tricks, it would have been impossible to thoroughly eliminate them in a place like this.

He faintly sensed that he was not the only one to have perceived the danger within Zangxiong Valley—otherwise, there would not have been rumors outside claiming that even Origin Returning experts had fallen here.

After a moment, Yang Kai said in a deep voice, “If I say we go back now, would you feel dissatisfied?”

Yang Yan nodded obediently.

Yang Kai grinned and said, “I’d feel the same. Since that’s the case, let’s look for it — after all it’s only within a thousand li; at worst we’ll turn this thousand li inside out.”

Hearing that, Yang Yan immediately brightened. The two began searching the nearby thousand-li area.

A day later, Yang Kai abruptly stopped, eyes narrowing as he scanned the surroundings suspiciously. Yang Yan saw this and, knowing he’d found something, quietly waited. After a while Yang Kai displayed a strange expression and slowly asked, “Do you smell something weird?”

“Yes — like something rotting,” Yang Yan replied; she had clearly noticed it too.

“So it really is as I thought. Seems it wasn’t just my imagination.” Yang Kai let out a low chuckle as a jet-black fireball suddenly appeared in his palm. The instant it emerged, the surrounding void was scorched and distorted, the searing heat within it seeming powerful enough to burn through space itself.

Yang Kai flicked his hand and hurled the black fireball at a nearby withered tree.

The fireball didn’t travel fast, but just as it was about to touch that unremarkable dead wood a repressed, low roar issued from within the tree — the sound of a trapped beast howling from a cage, deep and grave. Immediately a murderous aura burst forth.

With a thunderous boom, the withered tree was blasted to powder by a tremendous force erupting from within, and a towering, imposing figure suddenly appeared in its place.

The giant shape thrust a palm forward like a fan; a pale yellow aura instantly wreathed its hand. It reached out unflinchingly toward the black fireball.

A hissing roar rang out as the pale yellow aura met the black fireball; it was like throwing a handful of salt into a hot oil pan, provoking a violent reaction. The pale yellow aura quickly dimmed, but Yang Kai’s Demonic Flame also weakened considerably.

After a moment the pale yellow aura and the black fireball both dissipated without a trace, and the true visage of that towering figure was revealed to Yang Kai and Yang Yan.

Seeing this face, Yang Kai’s color changed violently. A look of incredulity crossed his features, while Yang Yan cried out in alarm, “Corpse Soldier!”

“Corpse Soldier?” Yang Kai glanced at her — it was the first time he’d heard of such a thing. The tall figure opposite was clearly not a living person; its face was desiccated as if every drop of moisture had been sucked dry, skin stretched over bone, eye sockets sunken, two green eyes flashing like ghost-fire. Its body, though towering, matched its face: skin tight over bone, gaunt to the point of horror, its appearance enough to send a chill down one’s spine.

Yang Kai felt no trace of vitality from it — only dense deathly qi and the stench of corpses. Were it not for the waves of aura emanating from its body on par with the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, Yang Kai would have taken it for a mere corpse.

Yet this thing that resembled a corpse had just dispersed his Demonic Flame fireball with a single strike, thwarting any effect it might have had.

The rank stench the two had smelled earlier came from this being; it had been muffled by the dead wood, which is why it hadn’t been so clear.

“What is this?” Yang Kai asked, bewildered.

“You can think of it as a kind of living being!”

“A living being?” Yang Kai’s face changed. He opened his mouth to ask more, but the Corpse Soldier’s face suddenly twisted into a strange grin — because its skin was so shrunken the expression looked especially grotesque and ferocious — and then a hoarse voice issued from its throat: “Good, good, two fresh meals have come, especially that girl; her flesh is tender — she’ll taste exquisite when I eat her.”

At those words Yang Yan shuddered and quickly darted behind Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s earlier bewilderment quickly subsided. If Yang Yan said the Corpse Soldier was a living being, then its awareness and speech were less surprising. It was his first time encountering such an odd creature, but considering the existence of yin-souls, Corpse Soldiers were not so hard to believe.

Grinning, Yang Kai looked at it and said, “You want to eat my companion?”

“Do you have a problem with that?” the Corpse Soldier sneered, its green eyes glinting dangerously. “Don’t worry — you won’t escape either. Soon you’ll be filling my belly.”

“You want to eat me?” Yang Kai sounded amused. His face went cold and he barked, “Aren’t you afraid you’ll shatter your teeth?”

With that he flicked his hand and a jet-black long sword appeared. He slashed forward with brutal force; streaks of black sword light tore through the void and flew toward it like a storm.

The Corpse Soldier showed no fear. With a hideous chuckle it did not dodge; its arms crossed before it and the faint pale-yellow aura that had appeared earlier instantly rolled over its body as it charged straight into the sword light.

Yang Kai’s face tightened, but he made no other moves and merely watched coldly.

The sword lights struck precisely against the creature’s arms, yet its body only staggered slightly from the impact; its arms were completely uninjured within that pale-yellow aura, and the clash produced crisp metallic ringing.

“A Corpse Soldier’s flesh is incredibly tough — not comparable to a cultivator of the same rank, and not inferior to a defensive Secret Treasure.” Yang Yan’s warning came from behind.

“I see!” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

“You girl seem to know a lot about beings like us. Heh heh, you’ll be my first taste!” the Corpse Soldier snickered, and in an instant lunged at Yang Kai, stretching out a shriveled hand whose long, black nails gleamed with a cold, uncanny light as it reached to seize Yang Kai’s head.

Before its hand fully closed, the tearing sound of air sliced through incessantly, as if it had been trying to wrench Yang Kai’s skull from his body.

Yang Kai raised his hand and threw a punch directly at its gaping palm.

“Foolhardy!” the Corpse Soldier jeered at Yang Kai’s attempt to engage it with raw strength. Its fingers tightened and curled, gripping Yang Kai’s fist tightly, and then it exerted force at the fingertips to crush his hand into paste.

Yet to his surprise, when he grasped it, the opponent’s fist—though appearing full of flesh and seemingly fragile—was incomparably solid. Even with seventy percent of his strength unleashed, he could not tear through so much as a single layer of its skin.

Instead, the tremendous force from Yang Kai’s fist caused the Corpse Soldier’s green eyes to flicker wildly; with a shriek it was hurled backwards like a kite, its face full of astonishment.

Yang Kai’s body jolted as he retreated a few hurried steps, feeling a coldness spread across his fist. Looking down he saw five black fingertip marks on the back of his hand, emitting thick black qi that writhed as if alive, trying to seep into his body.

“Beware of its Corpse Qi — that stuff is venomously yin; once it invades it’s hard to expel,” Yang Yan warned in time.

Yang Kai’s face went cold as his Demonic Flame erupted through his body, transforming into an existence of scorching iron.

The writhing black qi seemed to meet an antidote; after emitting faint, almost imperceptible howls it fled from the back of Yang Kai’s hand and dissipated into the air.

Seeing this, Yang Yan breathed easier. The most troublesome aspects of Corpse Soldiers were their hardened bodies and that bizarre Corpse Qi; since Yang Kai feared neither, she had less to worry about.

Indeed, when Yang Kai easily dispelled the Corpse Qi, the fallen Corpse Soldier’s pupils shifted and it displayed an expression of hesitation.

In its mind it had thought that a Second Stage Saint King Realm cultivator plus Yang Yan would be no match for it; it believed it could finish them off in a few moves and devour their flesh to strengthen itself.

It had done such things more than once before, but now it found this Second Stage Saint King Realm practitioner unlike those it had met previously, a type not so easily dealt with.

This made it uncertain whether to continue the attack.

While it hesitated, Yang Kai did not intend to let it off; with a flick of his finger an almost imperceptible golden thread shot forth noiselessly. Only when it reached the Corpse Soldier’s face did it notice; with a low roar the creature opened its maw and spewed a dense wave of Corpse Qi toward the golden thread.
