## Chapter 917 — It's Fine Like This

"You two keep talking; I'll go on ahead. If Ningshang has anything she doesn't understand, she can come find me anytime—I live in the Saint Lord's Garden too." An Ling'er saw the five masters leave and, showing good sense, departed as well.

"Mm, I'll be troubling you a lot from now on, Sister." Xia Ningshang nodded softly and watched her figure disappear.

The next moment she felt Yang Kai sweep her up in a horizontal carry; she couldn't help a small gasp, her little hands clutching his neck as she hurriedly asked, "Junior Brother, what are you doing?"

"I have so many things to tell you." Yang Kai smiled as he carried her toward his room.

"I do too..." Xia Ningshang rested her head on Yang Kai's shoulder.

In the side room, on the fragrant bed, Yang Kai sat at the edge while his Little Senior Sister was placed on his thigh, maintaining an intensely intimate posture.

Their bodies pressed close, chests opposite one another; Yang Kai's eyes burned hot as fire, a mischievous smile playing at his lips, his large hands boldly misbehaving.

Dressed in jet-black, the Little Senior Sister's figure was exquisitely delicate and still guileless, full and rounded; feeling Yang Kai's hands glide over her waist and between her thighs, waves of shivering tingle ran from his fingers through her. Her beautiful eyes were moist, her face flushed with bashfulness, and she dared not look him in the eye.

Her breathing grew heavy, and the heat radiating from her slender body became blistering.

Yang Kai ignored it, taking liberties with a carefree relish—his spirits soared and he grew ever more unrestrained.

"Junior Brother... don't do this..." Xia Ningshang bit her red lip, her voice a faint whisper.

"Do what?" Yang Kai asked with perverse amusement. For some reason, seeing Little Senior Sister so ready made him especially excited; it was as if he wanted to see how far her shyness would stretch.

"Exactly like that... it makes me so restless." Summoning her courage, Xia Ningshang gripped one of Yang Kai's hands and stopped its motion at her waist.

The sensations from between her thighs intensified, causing her to clamp her legs shut without realizing it.

In that instant the Little Senior Sister felt her sensations amplify by hundreds of times, able to clearly sense every subtle change in Yang Kai's body.

In her chest, her heart pounded fiercely, the thudding like war drums.

This tremor of mind and body was unlike anything Xia Ningshang had ever experienced; her heart fell into chaos and for a moment she was at a loss, helpless.

"Didn't you bring me here to talk?" Xia Ningshang tried to keep her mind clear, but an irresistible tide of feeling assailed her senses, leaving her dizzy and disoriented.

"Aren't we talking?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

"Mm..." Xia Ningshang couldn't argue and grew ever more overwhelmed, feeling weak all over as if thrown into a volcano; heat surged through her body, and her forbidden place unconsciously grew warm and wet.

"What does Little Senior Sister want to say?" Yang Kai asked again.

"I... I don't know. It's fine like this." Xia Ningshang closed her eyes and leaned her full weight against Yang Kai, feeling more satisfied than at any other time.

Seeing her like that, Yang Kai's thoughts wandered dangerously and he nearly lost control; he immediately circulated his cultivation to dispel the wicked notions.

His hands stilled; he watched her quietly, waiting for her mood to calm.

After a while, Xia Ningshang opened her shy eyes, an expression of lingering desire apparent on her face.

Yang Kai sat up straight and said in a serious tone, "When everything has settled, we'll proceed with what comes next."

Xia Ningshang nodded lightly, lowering her head to say softly, "Junior Brother, whenever you want."

Yang Kai's eyes brightened and he pulled her into an even tighter embrace; for the bashful Little Senior Sister to say that, she must have mustered considerable courage.

"For now let's talk properly—I have a lot to ask you," Yang Kai said, satisfied.

"What does Junior Brother want to ask?" Xia Ningshang asked in a gentle voice.

"How did you spend these past ten years?"

"I just followed Master around..." Xia Ningshang leaned against Yang Kai's chest and recounted the past ten years of her life. Yang Kai listened quietly, as if experiencing her hardships himself, feeling the trials Little Senior Sister had endured.

After a long time, Little Senior Sister finished and then asked Yang Kai about his own experiences during this period.

Yang Kai naturally did not hide anything.

Time slipped by as the two traded seemingly endless tender words, speaking softly and enjoying the quiet time that belonged only to them.

"By the way, Senior Sister Su Yan is at a place called the Ice Sect..." Xia Ningshang suddenly remembered and looked up to say.

"I know; I went to find her," Yang Kai grinned. "The environment there suits her cultivation. When I went she was in seclusion; we exchanged Divine Sense for a while, then I left. I don't know how she's doing now."

"Junior Brother, should we bring her back?"

"After this round of business is over, we'll go together to fetch her."

"Alright." Xia Ningshang nodded emphatically and then leaned down again.

"What about Di Mo? Do you have any news of him?" Yang Kai asked after a moment of thought.

Xia Ningshang shook her head. "When we surfaced from beneath Zhongdu back then, Senior Di Mo parted from us. He said he was going to the Demon Domain. Master and I also went to the Demon Domain, but we never heard anything about him—we don't know where Senior Di Mo's is now."

"That old demon... don't worry about him. It's not so easy for others to kill him," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

Di Mo's cultivation may not be very high now, but his physical body is extraordinary—the body of a demon general, the shell of a top expert at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm.

Only experts of the same tier could harm him.

So Yang Kai had never worried about that old demon; after all, top-level cultivation like the Third Stage of the Saint Realm is rare anywhere.

"I still miss the days at Lingxiao Pavilion," Xia Ningshang murmured. "Back then we were carefree—weak and ignorant of the mysteries of transcending into the Saint Realm." Her lovely eyes shone with nostalgia.

"Yes." Yang Kai sighed as well. "As one's strength grows, the things one encounters increase as well."

As he spoke, Yang Kai suddenly remembered something and said excitedly, "Right, Little Senior Sister, I have something good for you."

"What is it?" Xia Ningshang sat up and looked at him.

Yang Kai produced a jade vial containing two crystalline, translucent drops of liquid.

At the sight of the two drops, Xia Ningshang's eyes grew serious; she seemed to recognize their extraordinary nature.

"What is it?"

"The elixir of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower!" Yang Kai replied.

Xia Ningshang covered her mouth in astonishment—she had clearly heard of its renown. "Is it the elixir from the Thousand-Year Demon Flower that bloomed over at Fuyun City in the Neutral Domain?" she exclaimed.

"Yes. You know of it too, Little Senior Sister?"

"Mm. At the time Master said he would take me to see it to see if I could seize any opportunity, but there were simply too many people and it was too dangerous; Master couldn't guarantee my safety, so we left halfway." Xia Ningshang said, a strange light in her eyes. "So you were there too, Junior Brother?"

Yang Kai's face registered deep regret. "You were there too."

Xia Ningshang nodded slightly.

They exchanged a look of mutual regret; that time in Fuyun City they had no idea of each other's presence and merely passed one another, so that by the time they met again many years had already passed.

"So it was you who obtained it, Junior Brother."

"Although I obtained it, another person also deserves credit—someone you should know." Yang Kai smiled and continued without suspense, "A young man named Zhai Yao—do you remember him?"

"Elder Li's disciple?" Little Senior Sister indeed recalled him. "I remember him; I even competed with him in alchemy."

Yang Kai nodded with a smile. "Zhai Yao seemed pretty irked and vowed to challenge you again next time you met, though I don't think he'd be a match for you."

"Maybe. That time I barely won; with Elder Li guiding him, his alchemy was no slouch," Xia Ningshang said humbly.

"You are the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body—no one can rival you in alchemy." Yang Kai said as he produced an empty jade vial, drew a single drop of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's elixir into it, and handed it to Little Senior Sister. "When the time is right, refine this elixir; it should help you enter the Saint Realm. The Medicinal Spirit Saint Body can refine all the world's spiritual herbs and medicines without side effects. You are better suited than anyone to use this to reach sainthood."

"Mm, thank you, Junior Brother. But I still need time to accumulate the cultivation for my current realm." Xia Ningshang did not toy with Yang Kai; she accepted it with solemn gratitude and placed it into her Spatial Pouch.

"Come, I have another gift for you." Yang Kai said, scooping her up and leaping onto the bed.

He set her opposite him and sat cross-legged, saying in a low voice, "Lower the defenses of your Sea of Consciousness!"

Xia Ningshang did not hesitate and obeyed at once.

The next moment she felt Yang Kai's Divine Sense surge into her.

Inside Xia Ningshang's Sea of Consciousness was a pleasant landscape—befitting her innocent nature; the world within the Sea of Consciousness often mirrors a person's inner heart.

Their spirit bodies manifested and stood facing each other. Yang Kai asked, "Do you still remember the True Alchemy Formula I once taught you?"

"Of course I remember. Thanks to it my alchemy has improved so quickly."

"When I taught you in War City last time I hadn't fully grasped the True Alchemy Formula myself, so I only passed on half of it. Now I can teach you the whole thing."

Hearing that, Xia Ningshang's expression lit up with joy.

"Little Senior Sister, what level is your alchemy at now?" Yang Kai asked again.

"I haven't been certified by the Alchemists' Association, but I can refine Saint-Grade Middle-Level pills," Xia Ningshang replied, then a frustrated look crossed her face. "But once you reach this step you can't progress further; Saint-Grade materials are too scarce—there are hardly any chances to practice."

Although he'd had a vague suspicion, when his guess was confirmed Yang Kai was still stunned by Xia Ningshang's alchemical aptitude.
