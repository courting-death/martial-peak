## Chapter 1398 — Closing the Door to Beat the Dog

In the direction opposite where Myriad Beasts Mountain and its people stood, a group from the Demon Blood Sect was moving cautiously through a thicket. At their head was a man wrapped in bloodlight, his face taut with vigilance; although his Divine Sense detected nothing unusual here, a vague, unpleasant feeling nagged at him, as if some immense danger hovered at his side.

This spot should be considered the right flank of Dragon Lair Mountain, not far from the center; after all, Dragon Lair Mountain was not large, merely a speck of land.

Suddenly, distant piercing cries and the thunder of battle drifted over, and violent energy ripples surged in from afar.

The Demon Blood Sect followers trailing him all changed expression. One First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator said in a sullen tone, "Senior Brother Wu, the commotion is coming from the Myriad Beasts Mountain side. It looks like they've run into something. This little hill truly can't be judged by ordinary standards."

"Mm." The cultivator surnamed Wu turned his head and gave a curt order, "It doesn't look wrong here, but everyone be careful — don't fall into the enemy's traps or formations."

"Yes."

"Huh, what's this?" Suddenly a disciple seemed to spot something strange and asked in puzzlement, but before the cultivator surnamed Wu and the few other of the Origin Returning Realm could go investigate, a terror-filled scream came from that direction and cut off abruptly, then there was a muffled sound and the stench of blood spread.

Crunch... a chilling chewing sound echoed, making everyone’s hair stand on end. The man surnamed Wu and the others turned around in horror, only to see that at the spot where their fellow disciple had been standing, a bizarre, blood-red plant about three zhang tall had appeared. At that very moment, the plant had coiled around a corpse, its body writhing and twisting, as though a gaping mouth were savoring a delicious meal.

The teeth‑gnashing chewing came from that very plant.

What made faces blanch was that as it chewed and coiled, the Demon Blood Sect disciple's corpse shriveled at a visibly rapid pace, as if all the essence of his flesh and blood had been sucked dry. In the blink of an eye he became a desiccated corpse.

After absorbing the blood and flesh essence, the strange plant turned even more crimson; its long, swordlike leaves shimmered with a bloodlike gloss that sent chills down the spine.

Whoosh...

Those leaves that had seemed rock‑hard suddenly lashed out like long whips, snapping out for over ten zhang and directly enveloping another Demon Blood Sect disciple who stood frozen in place.

The disciple did not react slowly. In a panic he hurriedly produced a black‑gold, shieldlike Secret Treasure to block before him; though not top‑grade, it was at least a defensive Secret Treasure.

With the shield before him the Demon Blood Sect cultivator let out a breath of relief and and was about to retreat rapidly, when his eyes suddenly widened as he stared incredulously at the shield.

Crack...

The supposedly impregnable shield could not withstand the leaf's force; it was split clean in two and its luster dimmed. The long leaf, undeterred, sliced like a blade and plunged into the cultivator's belly, encasing him and dragging him backward.

“Courting death!” the man surnamed Wu roared in fury. How could he stand by and watch his sect’s disciple die so miserably before his eyes? The only reason he hadn’t reacted earlier was because the scene before him was simply too bizarre—he had never before encountered such a ferocious and sinister plant.

As he shouted, his right hand flicked and a swordlight‑like attack slashed at the retracting long leaf.

Energy collided and sparks flew; a metallic scraping rang in their ears. The leaf only trembled, its speed slightly hindered — it did not, as expected, get cut clean through.

It was that hard! Senior Brother Wu sucked in a cold breath. Though his strike had been casual, he was after all a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator; that a mere leaf could withstand him seemed unbelievable.

A fierce glint flashed in his eyes; with a snap of his fingers he launched a pitch‑black filament that exuded an extremely uncanny aura, dark vapors rolling and coiling upon it.

The Demon Blood Threads secret art!

Compared to the secret art Yang Kai had practiced, this was the genuine Demon Blood Threads technique — a method the Demon Blood Sect's upper echelons almost all mastered, endlessly variable and hard to guard against, and possessing the wondrous ability to shatter Shi.

The black filament flashed and vanished, and the long leaf dragging the Demon Blood Sect disciple could not withstand its assault; with a crisp snap it was severed into two sections. One segment continued retracting, while the section wrapped around the disciple fell to the ground.

What made their scalps crawl was that crimson blood flowed from the cut; even when severed it writhed and struggled on the ground as if it were alive.

The Demon Blood Sect disciple ensnared by the plant ultimately could not escape his fate. Though the man surnamed Wu acted swiftly and managed to pull him free within moments, when the group tore open those long leaves in a flurry of hands, they discovered that all the blood in his body had vanished—drained completely dry.

“What in the hell is this thing?” The man surnamed Wu’s face turned ashen as he turned to glare at the strange plant, deep wariness flooding his expression. This was only a single one—if there were ten of them, a hundred…

He did not dare think further. If that many appeared, nine out of ten people here would perish. Where had Dragon Lair Mountain obtained such things? Planting them here — wouldn't they risk injuring their own people?

Just as his brows furrowed and his expression grew grim, another cultivator at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm suddenly spoke in a trembling voice, “Senior Brother Wu… doesn’t something feel wrong about this?”

"What?"

"That... that thing keeps slapping the ground... it seems... it seems..."

"Seems what?" The cultivator surnamed Wu's expression shifted as something occurred to him.

Before his words finished, the ground around them rustled and split, and one by one plants identical to the strange specimen before them burst from the earth like bamboo shoots after the rain.

These things varied in height; some were two or three zhang tall, terrifying to behold, while others were not even half a chi, clearly newborn — but every one of them was crimson, as if their whole bodies had been cast with fresh blood.

Worse still, once they appeared the swordlike leaves began to sway slightly, like a hunting hound's nose sniffing prey.

Senior Brother Wu immediately broke out in a cold sweat.

All the Demon Blood Sect disciples stood rooted to the spot, not daring to move an inch.

They had witnessed the terrifying power of that strange plant with their own eyes; two senior brothers had died without a chance to strike back. Now so many had surged up from beneath, encircling them — who would rashly act and court death?

But their inaction did not mean the plants would also remain still. After a brief ripple of motion each leaf snapped rigid and, accompanied by howls of fierce wind, shot out like arrows in all directions. Every leaf accurately locked onto one Demon Blood Sect disciple.

"Dodge!" Wu barked as Saint Yuan exploded within him. He slashed the Demon Blood Threads forward, severing one leaf aimed at him in two, and his figure flickered as he vanished to the side.

Yet not everyone had his strength. Those of Saint King Realm were terribly unlucky: in the first wave five or six Saint King Realm cultivators were slaughtered on the spot, shredded into pieces by a single leaf. Blood sprayed onto the ground and then vanished as if even the spilled blood were being absorbed. Feeding on the blood made the plants even more violent; the leaves danced and turned a one hundred zhang area into a bloodsoaked killing ground. With screams sounding, one after another cultivator fell, dying on the spot.

Senior Brother Wu's heart churned with sorrow and rage, yet he was powerless; though he did not fear the leaves, to try and save so many alone was a fantasy.

High above Dragon Lair Mountain, within a certain point in the void, Yang Kai and Yang Yan stood silently side by side, overlooking the entire scene below.

The reason they could remain there unseen was largely thanks to Yang Yan's cloaklike Secret Treasure, whose concealment was miraculous; it was not guaranteed to hide them from a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm's scrutiny, but the nearest Third Stage was fifty li away, and even the strongest Divine Sense could not penetrate their disguise.

"Blood Sword Grass has really reached such a scale?" Yang Kai was greatly surprised. The crimson strange plants the Demon Blood Sect encountered were precisely the Blood Sword Grass he had brought back from the Flowing Flame Sandland.

At that time he had only obtained a single seed and had planted it, even dropping a single drop of Golden Blood onto it. After that he had paid it no attention, yet now the Blood Sword Grass had given him a surprise.

"The plant inherently possesses great growth potential; given sufficient blood it can grow without limit and once caused Dark Star considerable trouble," Yang Yan explained calmly, though a hint of puzzlement crossed her beautiful eyes. "But it shouldn't have grown this quickly — we haven't provided much blood these past years. That's odd."

Yang Kai sniffed and privately suspected it had to do with the drop of Golden Blood he had given it, but he did not say so; instead he asked curiously, "But wasn't there only a single Blood Sword Grass? How are there so many now?"

"Its vitality is tenacious. From one mother plant it can split off countless offspring — there's nothing strange about that."

“So that’s how it is.” Yang Kai nodded slightly, then glanced toward the Myriad Beasts Mountain cultivators fiercely battling the Fire Spirit Beasts on the other side. Grinning, he said, “Form the array—time to close the gate and beat the dogs.”
