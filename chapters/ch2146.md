## Chapter 2146 — A Strange Breakthrough

By the time Yang Kai rushed back, the fight between Liu Yan and Xiong Ning had already ended—as expected, Liu Yan had won decisively.

However, she hadn’t killed Xiong Ning; she’d crippled him and tossed him to the ground. Xiong Ning’s aura was feeble, and he groaned and howled in pain, looking utterly miserable.

On the other side, Huagu was still trapped in the earth, only his head exposed, while the Incarnation sat cross-legged in front of him, its massive hands spread wide like two giant claws, grasping at Huagu’s position.

A mysterious power emanated from those two giant hands.

Under the influence of this power, Huagu’s Origin Qi and even the essence of his flesh and blood were transformed into pure Spiritual Qi, surging into the Incarnation’s body to be completely absorbed.

Witnessing this, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed slightly.

"Master…" Liu Yan walked over, her beautiful eyes filled with shock. "What technique is this?" she asked in a low voice.

She too was startled by the Incarnation’s actions. Although Huagu and his companions had acted despicably and deserved death, what the Incarnation was doing now looked like it was extracting the very essence and power from Huagu’s body, turning it into its own strength.

As the Incarnation continued, Huagu’s body rapidly shriveled like a fruit drained of moisture. His skin cracked, his face turned sallow, and his cultivation at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm diminished at a terrifying speed.

To die in such despair and torment was far more terrifying than being torn to pieces.

“Heaven Devouring Battle Art!” Yang Kai answered in a low voice.

He was a bit surprised as well, not expecting the Incarnation to have cultivated the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to such a degree.

The scene before him felt strangely familiar…

Back in the Bone Prison of Biyu Sect, when he released Wu Mengchuan, Wu Mengchuan had used the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to devour all the other martial artists in the prison, causing them to die unnatural deaths. In a very short time, he had recovered to his peak state.

The Incarnation clearly couldn’t use it as freely as Wu Mengchuan, but the nature was the same—they were both absorbing others’ power to strengthen themselves!

The Heaven Devouring Battle Art could devour all things with spirit in the world. When cultivated to the extreme, it was incomparably domineering and unstoppable. The Heaven Devouring Great Emperor had provoked public outrage precisely because he practiced such a technique, which ultimately led to his own downfall.

“This technique is too domineering and evil!” Liu Yan frowned, clearly displeased.

Yang Kai nodded slightly in agreement. After witnessing this scene, he had to admit—it was an extremely evil and domineering technique.

As the two spoke, Huagu had already lost all vitality. His body was nothing but skin and bones, as if all flesh had vanished, while the Incarnation looked unsatisfied, reaching out to draw the half-dead Xiong Ning over and repeating the process…

Miserable cries echoed, reverberating in the canyon below for a long time.

Soon, Xiong Ning too became a dried corpse.

Only then did the Incarnation exhale in satisfaction.

Yang Kai could clearly sense that after using the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to devour the full cultivation of two Dao Origin Realm martial artists, the Incarnation’s aura had grown much stronger. Yet for some reason its once-clear eyes now flickered with a strange, sinister light.

Through his Divine Sense connection, Yang Kai vaguely felt that the Soul Incarnation residing in the Incarnation’s body had changed somewhat, with an unfamiliar aura lingering within.

"This technique… you didn’t cultivate it back then. That was a wise decision!" the Incarnation rumbled.

“Oh? Why?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

The Incarnation said, “Before, I was only absorbing the essence of various minerals and didn’t notice anything. I just thought this technique was incredibly powerful and made cultivation progress fast. But now… something is affecting my soul. I can’t help but feel bloodthirsty, wanting to kill, wanting to devour more!”

As he spoke, a faint red light flashed in his eyes.

“Addictive, is it…” Yang Kai muttered, stroking his chin.

The Incarnation shook his head. "That’s not the point. When you use this technique to devour energy, you also devour other things that can affect your true nature!"

“I see.” Yang Kai nodded, then asked, “And now…?”

“Nothing to worry about!” The Incarnation waved a hand. “I reckon the ‘other things’ devoured are the lingering obsessions of the dead, or the panic and rage at the brink of death. If you were the one to absorb them, they’d be nigh impossible to purge. But I am different…” He grinned, slapped his body, and said with pride, “This is the flesh of the Stone Puppet race—born to cleanse impurities. I think… a short rest, and it will be fine.”

"Then don’t delay—come back now!" Yang Kai said, taking the Xuan Realm Pearl from Liu Yan and, with a thought, storing the Incarnation inside.

"That big guy… he’ll be all right, right?" Liu Yan asked worriedly.

“He’ll be fine. The Stone Puppet race’s constitution is special. But until he completely purifies those things affecting his true nature, he probably can’t use the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to devour energy again,” Yang Kai replied.

Still, after all this he began to understand why the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor ended up on a path of ruin at his peak. It seemed it wasn’t just his devouring of all things that provoked others’ resentment—his changing temperament likely played a part as well.

Just think, such a powerful martial artist, always thinking of devouring this and that—who could ever feel safe? And at the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s level, the only targets that could interest him were probably the other Emperors…

Even just for self-preservation, the other Emperors had no choice but to join forces and eliminate him!

“Hm?” As Yang Kai pondered, he suddenly turned to the side in surprise. “She’s about to break through?”

He had just noticed an unusual energy fluctuation from Zhang Ruoxi’s direction—a clear sign of an impending breakthrough!

Without needing his instruction, Liu Yan retrieved the Luanfeng feather.

“That little girl’s constitution is strange!” Liu Yan said quietly, watching. “She seems able to directly absorb Spiritual Qi from the world, without needing much time to convert it!”

"Her constitution?" Yang Kai frowned and shook his head. "Her constitution should be normal—I checked before. But the bloodline power hidden in her body is hard to pin down."

The Ethereal Jade Disc reacted only to Zhang Ruoxi, indicating she’d inherited some ancestral bloodline power. But Yang Kai didn’t know what kind of bloodline it was, nor what the disc’s reaction truly meant.

Whatever the reason, Zhang Ruoxi’s cultivation speed was simply astonishing.

Previously, without a good cultivation environment, she’d seemed average enough. Her speed wasn’t slow, but that was thanks to the Marrow Cleansing Pill Yang Kai had given her—a Spiritual Pill that could let any martial artist below the Void King Realm cultivate and advance rapidly, improving their aptitude.

But once a martial artist reached the Void King Realm, the pill’s effects would disappear.

Yet here in this sea of Spiritual Qi, it was as if some restriction in her body had been lifted. She frantically devoured the surrounding Spiritual Qi, leaping in a short time to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and now she was about to break through to the Origin Returning Realm!

For a martial artist to break through from the Saint King Realm to the Origin Returning Realm, the first step is to condense their own domain.

Yang Kai had experienced this step himself, so he knew how difficult it was.

So he quickly focused his mind, preparing to send Zhang Ruoxi some guidance in secret.

With his current cultivation, he was qualified to do so.

But before he could speak, his face suddenly showed surprise.

Around Zhang Ruoxi, an invisible energy field surged forth, condensing her essence, energy, and spirit and maintaining itself within a ten-zhang radius; anything that happened within that range she could instantly perceive.

Shi!

Yang Kai’s expression was extremely odd.

Zhang Ruoxi had so effortlessly and without warning condensed her own Shi—and before even breaking through to the Origin Returning Realm…

Such an unbelievable thing—Yang Kai had never even heard of it, let alone seen it.

Liu Yan’s beautiful eyes also flickered with astonishment.

In the sky, clouds gathered, and the sea of energy churned in the canyon below.

After Zhang Ruoxi condensed her domain, her Heaven-and-Earth Energy Baptism arrived!

A thunderclap split the sky, Heaven-and-Earth Energy gathered into a pillar and crashed down onto Zhang Ruoxi’s delicate body.

With a muffled groan, a trace of pain appeared on Zhang Ruoxi’s face.

Yang Kai and Liu Yan immediately retreated, watching from afar!

With their current cultivation so far above Zhang Ruoxi’s, if they rashly entered her breakthrough range, they could interfere with the laws of Heaven and Earth and cause unpredictable consequences.

Zhang Ruoxi’s breakthrough was something only she could endure.

But the little girl had always seemed frail and delicate—Yang Kai couldn’t help but worry whether she’d succeed.

That thought had barely formed when his eyes suddenly widened as he stared behind Zhang Ruoxi.

He saw a phantom appear behind the little girl—ethereal and transparent, unreal. It rapidly expanded, transforming into a figure over a dozen zhang tall.

“What is that…” Yang Kai couldn’t help but exclaim softly.

Liu Yan’s face suddenly turned pale. For some reason she felt a deadly threat from that phantom—a terror that gripped her heart and made her want to flee as far as possible.

At this moment, the phantom’s outline became clear. Looking at it, it was like a woman magnified countless times, clad in armor, a cloak billowing behind her, hands crossed atop the hilt of a giant sword.

The woman’s figure was curvaceous and heroic, her hair flying.

Her features couldn’t be seen clearly—only a vague outline, and even that was unstable, constantly twisting. Yet she resembled Zhang Ruoxi, as if it were a magnified projection of Zhang Ruoxi wearing that outfit.
