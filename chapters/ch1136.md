## Chapter 1136 — Must Not Befriend

Outside the cave, a hush of stunned consternation fell.

Yu Feng and the Haike Family's dozens of warriors stood there, staring at the scene in complete silence.

Although they had witnessed last time when Yang Kai leapt ranks to slay Xu Zhishen and already knew of his fearsome might, they now realized he had grown even stronger.

Even Xu Zhikun, though wounded, had been a cultivator nearing the Origin Returning Realm; in the end he even overstretched his life, burning his Essence-Blood to unleash his potential, yet still could not withstand Yang Kai's single fist.

Is he a monster? Yu Feng watched Yang Kai's retreating figure, his eyes trembling violently.

Or could it be that all cultivators from the outside world are this fierce? If everyone out there is like Yang Kai, then just what have the people of Dark Star been cultivating all this time?

Amid their shock, Yang Kai stepped out, gathered the Secret Treasures and the dozen Spatial Rings scattered on the ground, swept them with his Divine Sense, snorted, and casually tossed them to Yu Feng.

"Give the Saint Crystals and materials inside to Wu Yi; divide the remaining items among yourselves."

"Huh?" Yu Feng cried in astonishment. "You don't want them?"

"I don't need them."

He had no use for what the Xu Family possessed—unless they harbored something like the Hundred Mountains Painting, but relics of that caliber were rare; Yang Kai believed even the Xu Family would possess at most one.

“Many thanks, Brother Yang.” Though startled, Yu Feng no longer stood on ceremony and quickly nodded in gratitude. Cheerfully, he ran to the side and began examining the contents of the dozen or so Spatial Rings with a wide grin, while the others gathered around him—every now and then letting out cries of astonishment.

No matter how formidable, the Xu Family were still a minor clan; among the Spatial Rings, the Family Head Xu Zhikun's ring contained the most—Secret Treasures, Pills, the Xu Family's cultivation manuals—and more than twenty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals, over forty thousand Middle-Level Saint Crystals, and upwards of a hundred thousand Lower-Level Saint Crystals.

Yu Feng's eyes went bloodshot.

He had long known killing and looting were the fastest ways to get rich, but the Haike Family were a bottom-tier clan—who could they kill, who could they provoke? Seeing this today removed any need for hearsay.

Their hundreds of brothers had risked life and death across the Starry Sky, spending years mining for ore; the clan's rewards seldom amounted to more than ten thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals—and even those crystals had been supplemented out of Wu Yi's own purse.

Yet today Yang Kai had slain only a few dozen men and reaped rewards the lot of them could not earn in their lifetimes—this gulf left them exhilarated and bitter.

The Secret Treasures and Pills were not of the highest tier; most were Saint-Grade, a few Saint King-Grade—perfectly suited for the several dozen who followed Wu Yi.

Most among them were cultivators of the Saint Realm; only four or five reached the Saint King Realm—and only at the first Stage—so Saint-Grade treasures and Pills would be put to full use.

"King Transformation Pills—there are ten of them!" Yu Feng suddenly shouted, his large hand trembling as he clutched the jade vial.

At those words many faces lit with excitement.

Though Yang Kai had never manufactured King Transformation Pills himself, he understood their purpose. A Saint King Pill was used to stabilize the cultivation of a newly advanced Saint King; a King Transformation Pill, on the other hand, could raise a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm toward the Saint King Realm—it was a Saint King-Grade Lower-Level Pill.

Many cultivators hit a ceiling at the peak of a major realm and cannot break through to the next. The Third Stage of the Saint King Realm was such a bottleneck; perhaps nine and a half out of ten had faced it. Fighters like Yang Kai, who could advance without such a choke point, were exceedingly rare.

Yang Kai had also relied on the function of the World-Ending Demon Eye to achieve what he had; without that eye he would have been like other cultivators and would need Pills to assist during major breakthroughs.

One Pill could raise the chance by at least thirty percent—so long as one's aptitude wasn't terrible, possessing such a Pill meant roughly a ninety percent probability of ascending into the Saint King Realm.

Nearly twenty among Wu Yi's followers were at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; the usefulness of those King Transformation Pills was self-evident.

The Haike Family also possessed King Transformation Pills, but they were reserved for the clan's promising disciples; the several dozen who followed Wu Yi had no claim. Those on the verge of breakthrough could be stalled—given these Pills, they could readily rise to the Saint King Realm.

Seeing his brothers' eager faces, Yu Feng's expression instantly grew grave. He solemnly tucked the jade vial into his bosom and said in a deep voice, "This is for the Miss; she will arrange a fair distribution!"

Everyone nodded in unison, offering no objection.

A thought struck Yang Kai—he should refine some cultivation Pills for them. Just because he had never needed Pills did not mean others did not; besides, producing King Transformation Pills was no great task.

Having settled on this, Yang Kai's gaze turned cold and fixed on the distance.

He well understood that the Haike Family's people had stood aside without acting. Their masters had come with the Xu Family but had not struck in concert—Yang Kai had no cause to take action against them.

Sensing his gaze, Ba Qingyan suddenly trembled like sifted chaff and, his voice quavering, said, "Family Head, I forgot one thing—last time Yang Kai stated that without his permission anyone who approaches within fifty li of the cave is his enemy."

When Yang Kai had declared that before, Ba Qingyan had not taken it to heart—after all, Dragon Lair Mountain belonged to the Haike Family and Yang Kai's words were something like seizing another's turf. But now, with the Xu Family's provocation and their heavy losses, Ba Qingyan no longer dared to belittle Yang Kai.

If Yang Kai used that as a pretext to strike, their people might not be able to withstand him.

"What?" Ian cried in alarm. "Fifty li?"

They were not even five li from the spot where they stood.

"Retreat!" Ian dared not linger and shouted, immediately falling back; the elders and Guest Elders hurried after him.

After falling back fifty li and discovering Yang Kai harbored no intent to pursue, they halted. Face to face they felt ashamed—before a single youth they had fled like dogs, a humiliation beyond bearing.

There was no time for such thoughts. Having witnessed the complete annihilation of a dozen Saint King Realm fighters from the Xu Family, all present grasped the magnitude of Yang Kai's worth.

Ian shot Ba Qingyan a venomous glare.

Ba Qingyan well understood the accusation and immediately stepped forward, clasping his hands. "Family Head, I misjudged. I never expected Yang Kai to possess such potential, nor that the woman's mastery of formations would be so profound. Had I known, I would have stopped Xu Zhishen from seeking trouble—Wu Yi would not have been driven from the clan, and then…"

"Enough—there's no point in saying that now," Ian snapped, waving his hand impatiently.

"Should we make efforts to befriend him?" Huang Juan asked anxiously. "His potential is terrifying, and the woman's array skills are so advanced—if we can tie them to us it would do us no harm."

"Indeed," Warren agreed, nodding. "Such two talents ought to be courted and drawn closer."

Unexpectedly, Ian shook his head. "Now is not the time to befriend them!"

"Why?" Huang Juan couldn't understand. "Before we had not seen their abilities, so abstaining might be excusable. But now that we've seen them—how could we let such an opportunity pass? Has the Family Head gone mad?"

"Have you all forgotten what Xu Zhikun cried out as he died?" Ian snorted.

Everyone reflected carefully, and before long each was visibly moved.

"Family Head—do you mean Yingyue Hall…?" Huang Juan asked uncertainly.

Ian sneered coldly. "Although the Haike and the Xu are low-tier, we still hang beneath the name of Yingyue Hall. Now that the Xu Family has lost so many—even their Family Head—Yingyue Hall has been slapped in the face. If they do nothing, who will trust them? Yingyue Hall will surely take action, and we must report everything witnessed today—otherwise we'll be in trouble when they come asking."

"But Family Head, won't that risk offending that youth? We won't be able to recruit him then," Warren asked.

"Recruit?" Ian scoffed. "Even if we brought him in, who could bind him? If he cannot be controlled, what use is he? With his talent and that woman's mastery of formations, should they be granted time to grow, who would speak for the Haike Family then? This place would end up bearing the Yang name."

Previously Ian had been inclined to recruit Yang Kai—he hadn't witnessed Yang Kai's true might and believed his years of experience plus the Haike Family's power could bring him under control.

But in the final instant of battle Yang Kai's fist reduced Xu Zhikun to splinters, and Ian realized such a man could not be kept within their grasp—if they recruited him they might raise a white-eyed wolf that would strip them to the bone.

Although Ian's attitude had reversed swiftly—even utterly—none present found fault; instead they admired the Family Head's resolute decisiveness.

To be a Family Head, his mind truly differed from ordinary men.

The Haike Family returned to their clan and immediately dispatched envoys to Tianyun City to report the day's events.

Tianyun City lay within Yingyue Hall's sphere of influence—one of the Hall's cities—and the city lord's mansion naturally hosted Yingyue Hall experts.

The envoy sent by the Haike Family was Huang Juan.

To her surprise, she was stopped outside the city lord's mansion by several guards who ogled her with leering eyes, making Huang Juan very uncomfortable.
