## Chapter 600 — Zhong Miaoke's Opportunity

Hua Duanhun’s conditions not only caused Zhong Miaoke’s face to lose its color, but everyone else’s expressions also turned strange.

Yefang, Xu Qianhao and the others thought for a moment and immediately realized; inwardly they cursed Hua Duanhun for being cunning, shrewd, and decisive, and each of them then offered handsome rewards and promising positions within their own Sects, sincerely hoping Zhong Miaoke would join the Shura Sect or the Chilian Sect.

The people from Yunlong Island and Twin Island likewise hurriedly issued similar invitations.

In an instant, the authorities of the five great Sects all looked at Zhong Miaoke with hungry eyes, their gazes full of expectation, as if in that moment Zhong Miaoke had become a rare prodigy the world would never again produce, and every one of those Sects had opened their doors to her.

Zhong Miaoke was stunned, and so were those disciples from Gu Yun Island who had just been gloating; their moods suddenly became especially complicated, filled with envy and jealousy.

On what basis? On what basis could this utterly unremarkable disciple cause so many Sects to court her so assiduously?

“Island Lord……” Elder Han Zhao quietly jabbed Gu Feng and gave him a look.

Gu Feng, suddenly alert, came to his senses and with a mingled warmth and anger said, “Friends, this is not right, is it? Zhong Miaoke is a disciple of my Gu Yun Island — you dare try to pry her from under my nose in front of me and think I, Gu Feng, am dead?”

“Heh heh……” Hua Duanhun laughed coquettishly, chuckling as he said, “Island Lord Gu, what are you saying? Weren’t you just about to throw this little girl into Cangyan Cave? You clearly don’t care whether she lives or dies. Why not do us a favor and let her come with me to the Falling Flower Divine Cult? I will cultivate her properly and will not waste her talent.”

“Yes, Island Lord Gu should do us the favor.” Xu Qianhao smiled.

“Impossible, impossible — Zhong Miaoke was born on Gu Yun Island and if she dies she will be a ghost of Gu Yun Island; no one will take her away!” Gu Feng shook his head like a rattle and refused outright.

By now he also saw that Zhong Miaoke carried some weight in Yang Kai’s heart; to control Zhong Miaoke was, in effect, to control the ties with Yang Kai.

“This matter must depend on the young lady’s own will; Island Lord Gu, your word alone doesn’t decide it. You can’t determine her future simply because she was once a disciple of Gu Yun Island.” Hua Duanhun snorted softly, looked at Zhong Miaoke with tender eyes, and in a low gentle voice said, “Little girl, don’t be afraid. Tell us — which Sect do you wish to join? Rest assured, whichever you choose, no one will make things difficult for you.”

“We will all respect your decision!” Yefang emphasized, and the others voiced the same.

Zhong Miaoke looked flustered, lowered her head and trembled, shrinking back and not daring to reply; she unconsciously edged closer to Yang Kai, as if seeking some safety.

She had been tending peacocks in a secluded corner of Gu Yun Island, burying herself in cultivation — when had she ever seen such a grand spectacle? For a time she could not adapt.

Especially faced with invitations from these Sects, Zhong Miaoke truly had no idea how to choose or what to do.

“You need not compete!” Li Yuanchun suddenly said with authority. “I have been searching these years for a disciple to take into seclusion; it is a pity I have not found a suitable candidate. Today I finally meet one, so do not contend with me over her.”

“Senior……” Gu Feng and the others were shocked, all staring at Li Yuanchun in utter astonishment.

From Li Yuanchun’s words it seemed … he intended to take Zhong Miaoke as a disciple.

This was a momentous matter!

The three top experts from the Tai Yi Sect who stand above the Divine Roaming Realm are like ancestors in the Overseas; the other two already have personal disciples, leaving only Li Yuanchun without one. Over the years it was indeed said he had been seeking a suitable seclusion disciple, but none in the Overseas had met his standards.

Unexpectedly, today Zhong Miaoke had the good fortune to obtain this opportunity.

“Indeed, I will take her as a seclusion disciple!” Li Yuanchun nodded slightly.

Once that sentence was spoken, not only did the disciples of Gu Yun Island’s eyes redden, but Gu Feng and the others also looked at Zhong Miaoke with faces full of envy.

With a top expert above the Divine Roaming Realm to instruct her, they could already foresee Zhong Miaoke’s bright future.

“Little girl, would you be willing to join my lineage as a disciple?” Li Yuanchun kindly asked Zhong Miaoke.

Zhong Miaoke’s face flushed, her excitement obvious; appearing flustered, she suddenly drew a deep breath, her chest rising, and she spoke softly, “B-but I am a disciple of Gu Yun Island…”

“Gu Feng!” Li Yuanchun turned to him and sneered, “I intend to take her as my disciple; do you object?”

Gu Feng hurriedly waved his hands. “I would never dare — to be noticed by Senior is her good fortune; Gu Feng could never have any objection.” As he spoke he looked toward Zhong Miaoke and said, “From this day forth you shall no longer be of Gu Yun Island. Once you follow Senior Li, you must put filial piety first and never commit any act of betraying your former Sect or of bringing shame upon your teachers and ancestors, understand?”

“The disciple will keep that in mind!” Zhong Miaoke nodded repeatedly.

Li Yuanchun laughed heartily.

While these people were clamoring to take Zhong Miaoke, Yang Kai had remained silent, quietly observing; only after matters were settled did he speak: “Congratulations, Senior Sister, on meeting a wise master. This Junior Brother will present you a small gift.”

“No need.” Zhong Miaoke hastily waved her hand.

“When Young Lord Yang offers a gift, one must accept it — one cannot refuse Young Lord Yang’s face!” Li Yuanchun promptly interjected, anxious at the thought Zhong Miaoke might decline.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, produced a small waterskin and handed it to Zhong Miaoke, quietly instructing, “Take one drop of this each day. When you return, hand it to Senior Li for safekeeping. Consider it my thanks for saving my life.”

“Oh.” Zhong Miaoke accepted the small waterskin, looking at the palm-sized item with a puzzled expression, not understanding what Yang Kai had given her or why he was so solemn about it.

When she looked up, Zhong Miaoke was startled to see many people staring at the little waterskin in her hand with blazing eyes, as if they had discovered some incredible treasure.

“Rest assured, Young Lord Yang — since this gift was given to my disciple, I can guarantee that no one else will be allowed to use it.” Li Yuanchun said in a deep voice.

“That is fine.” Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction; he still trusted Li Yuanchun’s character. Saying this before so many people publicly expressed his stance.

“Everyone, please stay — I will take my leave!” Yang Kai cupped his fist, gave Shan Qingluo a slight nod, and together they rose into the air and, like lightning, departed.

Watching his retreating figure and recalling all he had displayed in Zhongdu, the people of the Overseas Sects’ hearts were stirred.

“Senior, just what sort of person is my Junior Brother?” Zhong Miaoke’s gaze softened and grew a little misty; even now she could not understand how the junior who had lived with her for half a year could suddenly transform into someone accorded such respect by everyone.

“Still calling me Senior?” Li Yuanchun stroked his beard and smiled slightly.

“Master……” Zhong Miaoke felt embarrassed.

“Hmm, your Junior Brother is actually the head of the Yang Family, the foremost of Zhongdu’s Eight Great Families. Half a year ago it was under his leadership that Zhongdu was able to resist the invasion of the Cangyun Evil Land and slaughter those bandits.”

“That impressive?” Zhong Miaoke, with little worldly experience, could only give a small exclamation at Li Yuanchun’s words.

“By the way.” Gu Feng suddenly interjected, “it seems you and he have some fate. Years ago it was he who stuck that letter with a dagger on your door, telling us the whereabouts of the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique. Years later you saved him from the sea; could this not be called good returns?”

“Ah?” Zhong Miaoke’s pretty face changed and she cried out, “It was him?”

“Yes, it was him — didn’t he tell you?” Gu Feng asked in surprise.

Zhong Miaoke choked up, her delicate shoulders trembling as she stared blankly toward where Yang Kai had disappeared; her heart was filled with great loss and remorse.

…………

Like the wind and lightning, the surroundings sped past.

Yang Kai, Shan Qingluo and Biluo — the three of them — sped like lightning toward Zhongdu.

Following behind Yang Kai and watching his broad back, Shan Qingluo’s gaze grew somewhat absent, and her breathing gradually became heavier.

Detecting her abnormality, Biluo hurried forward and took her hand.

Shan Qingluo slowly shook her head to indicate she was fine, not daring to pay Yang Kai any more attention.

Yet she felt a little surprised; though this young man only possessed the Sixth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, his flight speed was even a bit faster than hers, and the purity and richness of the True Yuan swelling within him surpassed hers.

Shan Qingluo felt no loss, but rather some pride.

They flew on in silence, keeping their heads down for three days.

Then Shan Qingluo and Biluo, who followed Yang Kai, suddenly halted.

Sensing this, Yang Kai also stopped, turned his head and asked, “What is it?”

Shan Qingluo panted lightly and smiled through pursed lips: “Let us part here. You will return to Zhongdu, but I am the Enchantress Queen, a remnant of the Cangyun Evil Land; naturally I must return to Piaoxiang City.”

Yang Kai frowned. “The Cangyun Evil Land is gone — why do you still care? No one there will blame you.”

Shan Qingluo shook her head, her expression firm.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and said, “If that is so, I will not force you. Once I have affairs in Zhongdu arranged, I will come to see you and resolve what is between us.”

“I will wait for you!” Shan Qingluo smiled radiantly.

Yang Kai nodded and then sped away.

After he left, it was a while before Biluo sighed softly: “My lady, is this all right?”

“There is nothing wrong, provided it does not harm him.”

“But the seed of attachment in your heart……” Biluo’s eyes instantly reddened. “Can you still suppress it? Once you cannot, you will bring about your own destruction! He never once cared for your feelings; why do you worry about him? Release that attachment and simply take his life — end it all!”

“Biluo!” Shan Qingluo gasped for breath, her face flushed. “Stop. Let me end the tragedy of the Poison Widow Lineage; it must not be passed down generation after generation. Otherwise my daughter will suffer the same pain — this is the curse of the Poison Widow Lineage!”
