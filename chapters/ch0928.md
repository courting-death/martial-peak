## Chapter 928 — Obey Without Question

"Not late, not late — you returned just in time." Su Xuanwu wiped at the corner of his eye and said with relief.

In their most perilous hour, Yang Kai had once again appeared from the skies and resolved their crisis, just as he had over ten years ago. Past events were vivid in their minds; time had moved on, but their absolute faith in Yang Kai remained unchanged.

It seemed that as long as he was present, there was nothing to fear.

"Brother-in-law!" Bound hand and foot, Su Mu wobbled to his feet and grinned at Yang Kai, part ashamed but more excited than anything.

After more than ten years apart, Su Mu had astonishingly reached the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

Yang Kai's eyes brightened; he patted Su Mu's shoulder and laughed, "Long time no see — you've made good progress."

As he spoke, he shattered the ropes binding him and broke the seal inside his body.

Su Mu's advancement had been far faster than Fang Ziqi's. This was very likely connected to the benefits he gained back in the Inheritance Celestial Cave.

Su Mu had indeed obtained certain advantages inside the Inheritance Celestial Cave, though no one knew exactly what he had received.

Moreover, the Wan Yao Ling Ye Yang Kai had given Su Yan — Su Mu had gotten a large portion from his sister. With the Wan Yao Ling Ye improving his constitution, it was not an exaggeration that he could reach this level in ten years.

"Sister? Has she come back?" Su Mu scanned the arrivals but saw no trace of Su Yan and felt a pang of disappointment.

"No — don't worry. Su Yan is in a very safe place right now," Yang Kai reassured.

Su Mu nodded.

While Yang Kai spoke with old acquaintances, Li Rong and the others had already removed the restraints from the warriors of the three factions, restoring their strength. Many of the fighters wore expressions of astonished delight and gathered around, visibly moved.

Li Yuntian, Zhao Hu, and the others who knew Yang Kai could not help but cry out in surprise, their excitement boundless.

Their growth had been limited; none of them had reached the Divine Roaming Realm — they were all at the True Yuan Realm level. After all, they lacked the opportunities and talent of Su Mu and Yang Kai; even a lifetime of effort would yield only modest results.

"What of Master?" Yang Kai frowned; he could not find Ling Taixu's figure and asked with concern.

"The Sect Leader went to Zhongdu to seek aid several months ago, but Zhongdu's situation may also be..." Su Xuanwu explained gloomily.

"The Sect Leader?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. "Who is the leader now?"

Su Mu chuckled and pointed at himself.

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise and gave a slight nod.

With Su Mu's current strength, he was indeed qualified to be Lingxiao Pavilion's Sect Leader, since several elders had not yet attained the Transcendent Realm.

Su Mu pulled a rueful face. "Brother-in-law, you wouldn't know — since you left the Sect Leader has been traveling the world and hasn't managed sect affairs. A few years ago he returned briefly and handed the leader's position to me. I couldn't very well refuse..." He sighed.

"No wonder you're the only one tied up like that and treated differently — turns out it's because of your status," Yang Kai laughed heartily.

"Don't tease me, brother-in-law," Su Mu said, scratching his head awkwardly. "How could I compare to you? By the way, what's your cultivation now? I can't quite make you out."

"Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm."

"Ah!"

Everyone cried out in shock and disbelief.

Ling Taixu was only at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm; the Hu family sisters, recently lauded as the nation's top experts, were only at the First Stage. Yet Yang Kai had already reached the Third Stage.

When he left Zhongdu he had been only at the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm; now, in just over ten years, such rapid advancement was downright astonishing.

"What about my sister? She must be strong too, right?" Su Mu asked, visibly stirred.

"She should also be at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm," Yang Kai said with a faint smile. "But I haven't seen her for years, so I'm not clear on her current situation."

After a moment, Yang Kai asked, "What's the situation with the sect? Has it been occupied?"

"Yes," Su Mu said with a bitter chuckle. "Not only has Lingxiao Pavilion been occupied, but the nearby Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower were taken as well. Their numbers weren't large — just a few hundred — but they included very powerful experts; we couldn't resist at all..."

Everyone began talking at once, recounting the current state of affairs.

As Yang Kai had guessed, the entrance to this world had appeared near the Xiaoyao Divine Cult. The cult naturally investigated; upon discovering the land's vastness and its hidden wealth, they immediately sent a large contingent of experts and crushed the three nearby factions with overwhelming force. The people of Lingxiao Pavilion, Fengyu Tower, and the Blood Battle Gang were all reduced to prisoners.

To ensure they could claim this prize, the Xiaoyao Divine Cult even called in two or three other factions to assist.

They then used this place as a springboard to march toward Zhongdu.

That had happened a month ago; no one here knew Zhongdu's current condition — there had been no useful news. But judging by the enemies' strength, Zhongdu would have no means to resist.

Otherwise Ling Taixu would not have failed to return; it was quite possible he had met with misfortune.

The warriors of the three nearby sects had mounted resistances at times, but each time many were slain.

"They don't regard us as human; they kill or spare as they please. Many were slain for no reason — like pigs and dogs..." Su Mu said through clenched teeth.

"Many of the Blood Battle Gang's female disciples were violated by those beasts!" Hu Man charged forward, shouting angrily. At his words the Hu family sisters' expressions darkened noticeably.

There was some relief: when the Void Passage entrance first opened, if the two of them had not gone in advance to probe, they likely would have suffered as well — not to mention the timely arrival of Yang Kai's reinforcements.

"Nephew Yang, what do you intend to do? We'll follow your lead," Xiao Ruohan, master of Fengyu Tower, stepped forward and looked at Yang Kai.

"They bully others with their power?" Yang Kai snorted coldly, his gaze turning icy. "Very well. I didn't wish to raise a fist, but since they are so inhumane, there is no need for restraint. Li Rong!"

"My lord!" Li Rong, equally angered, answered, her voice taut with fury.

"You and Han Fei take a sweep — clear out every invading enemy among the three nearby factions. Don't leave a single one."

"Yes!" Li Rong replied. She and Han Fei's graceful forms flickered, and they were gone.

The gathered folk watched, dumbstruck; before they could react, Li Rong and Han Fei had already left.

"Yang, my nephew, do not be rash," Xiao Ruohan blurted, startled, hurrying to stop him. He had not expected Yang Kai to act so boldly without first gauging the enemy. "There are several formidable masters among them."

"Indeed — they have more than a dozen Transcendent Realm experts, many at the Second and Third Stages. I've even heard they have someone of the Saint Realm, apparently stronger than the Transcendent Realm," Hu Man complained. "Isn't sending those two girls over a bit too reckless?"

"Saint Realm?" Yang Kai grinned and shook his head. "Relax. Even if there is a Saint Realm expert, they would be insignificant before those two."

"What realm are those two at?" Wei Xitong's body trembled as he looked at Yang Kai with bright eyes.

“They’re also in the Saint Realm, but should be far stronger than the enemy. It’s not just that there’s only one Saint Realm expert here—even if a hundred of them came, they still might not be a match for them.”

Everyone was rendered speechless, staring at Yang Kai as if he were a monster.

Leaving aside his own cultivation, in just over ten years he had advanced from the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm to the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, forging a legendary miracle — and on this return he had even brought two such women.

From the way those women addressed Yang Kai and how he treated them, he seemed to hold absolute dominance — summoning them like a master.

They not only harbored no complaint, but obeyed Yang Kai's words without question.

Weren't they far stronger than Yang Kai? How could they so readily follow his orders?

This strange phenomenon left everyone puzzled and unable to explain it.

“My good girls…” Hu Man quietly came up beside the two Hu Family sisters and said softly, “From the looks of it, the road ahead for you two is still a long one.”

"What road?" Hu Mei'er asked suspiciously, glancing at her father.

Hu Man said, "Those two ladies are deeply skilled, pretty, and extremely obedient — you can't compete with them."

"Why would we compete with them?" Hu Mei'er grew more confused.

Hu Jiao'er rolled her eyes as realization dawned; she glared at Hu Man. "Mind your own business."

Hu Man chuckled, "Isn't a father worried about his daughters' lifelong happiness? Don't miss a good match. Yes, your father supports you — always. Find an opportunity to throw yourself at him; be proactive, not passive. Men like him don't lack women!"

Hu Mei'er finally registered and demurred shyly, "What are you saying?"

Hu Jiao'er said with a sly smile, "If you still want someone to look after you in your old age, shut your mouth."

"I won't say any more, I won't," Hu Man immediately clamped his mouth shut and sighed softly, thinking to himself that despite dozens of concubines and many households, he had only two daughters — why couldn't he have a son like Yang Kai? Now he had to rely on his daughters' favor to be cared for in his old age.

"Everyone." After speaking with the Lingxiao Pavilion people for a while, Yang Kai announced loudly, "It's about time to return to your sect. If you feel unsafe, you may temporarily stay at Lingxiao Pavilion. Su Mu, can the pavilion accommodate people from the three sects?"

Su Mu thought seriously for a moment and said, "If we squeeze them in it should be fine, though the conditions may be a bit cramped."

"Master Xiao, Chief Hu — whether you come to Lingxiao Pavilion is your decision. A few elders and I will return to the pavilion first," Yang Kai informed them, then headed toward Lingxiao Pavilion.

Hu Man and Xiao Ruohan exchanged a look and wordlessly followed.

The Xiaoyao Divine Cult's invasion had left them psychologically scarred; they secretly felt uneasy if they did not stay close to Yang Kai.
