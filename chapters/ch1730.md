## Chapter 1730 — Mine Star

People were born, grew old, fell ill, and died; stars were no exception.

Although Yang Kai did not know what had caused this star to become a Dead Star, from the supplies the Stone Puppet had brought back earlier it was obvious that long ago this place had been rich in resources and beautiful in scenery! The ruins before him should have been where some Sect's main headquarters once stood.

A call from not far off interrupted Yang Kai's thoughts; when he turned his head he saw the Stone Puppet calling to him.

Yang Kai nodded lightly, his figure flickered, and he gave chase.

As he walked, Yang Kai repeatedly checked his surroundings, and he soon discovered there was no danger here, for there was no Spiritual Qi in the heavens and earth, so even if formations remained in the ruins, even if they were intact, they could not be activated.

In other words, this ruin was an extremely safe place.

After a short while, the Stone Puppet led Yang Kai to a storeroom-like place where a large amount of minerals had been piled up, along with some jade bottles and various odds and ends.

The jade bottles evidently contained Spiritual Pills.

Yang Kai picked up several jade bottles to inspect them and found the Spiritual Pills inside had long since lost their Spiritual Qi and crumbled to ashes, so he paid them no further attention; some of the worthless items were clearly herbs that had, over countless years, lost their potency and become useless.

There were also large quantities of Saint Crystals, but because these Saint Crystals had been poorly preserved they were basically useless; the Saint Crystals the Stone Puppet had swallowed were likely all of the usable Saint Crystals inside.

In such a storeroom, the only things of real value left were those minerals!

Minerals endured the ages; even without special preservation they did not lose their efficacy.

In the storeroom there were roughly several times the amount of minerals the Stone Puppet had swallowed; each was a rare item of enormous value.

Yang Kai swept his hand through and gathered all the minerals into his Spatial Ring, then continued exploring the surrounding area with the Stone Puppet.

A day later he had finished exploring the entire ruin.

There was nothing particularly remarkable to be gained; the valuable things in the ruins had likely all been stored in the storeroom, and even the Spatial Rings on the bones had collapsed long ago for lack of Spiritual Qi, their contents destroyed.

However, Yang Kai discovered that within this vast underground space the surface ruins were merely the tip of the iceberg.

Beneath the ground, it seemed there was another world! It covered an exceedingly vast area.

He decided to explore it.

After leaving the surface ruins, Yang Kai had flown forward for only half a day before arriving at a desolate mountain range whose interior contained countless cave-like openings.

Upon arrival, the Stone Puppet that had been following Yang Kai suddenly wore an eager expression, as if very interested in the mountain's interior.

"Are there minerals inside?" Yang Kai asked as he turned to it.

The Stone Puppet was especially sensitive to minerals; the more precious the item, the more it stirred its desire. Like wolves and dogs with naturally keen noses, the Stone Puppet had a unique scent for minerals!

Hearing Yang Kai's question, the Stone Puppet immediately nodded.

"Let's go, take a look!" Yang Kai laughed, swept his hand out, and Saint Yuan wrapped the Stone Puppet as they charged into the mountain.

A moment later, a low shout from within the mine reached Yang Kai: "Annihilation Crystal vein!"

Indeed, there was a vein here, and it was an extremely rare Annihilation Crystal vein!

Annihilation Crystal could not be used to forge Secret Treasures, because it was extremely repellent to Spiritual Qi—one could say it reached the point of utter incompatibility with Spiritual Qi! If used to refine a Secret Treasure, no one could use it and the Secret Treasure would be completely ruined.

But its value was beyond doubt.

Precisely because it innately repelled Spiritual Qi, it could be used to arrange formations! A formation laid with Annihilation Crystal could restrict a warrior from using Saint Yuan; if one accidentally fell into it, it would be like arriving at Ghost Isle, forced to rely only on the strength of the flesh.

The renowned Annihilation Void Grand Array required Annihilation Crystals to serve as its Formation Cores.

A warrior who could not use Saint Yuan or even Secret Treasures—what could such a person be called? The residents of Ghost Isle used Huntian Pills to temper their bodies to survive there; not every warrior had Huntian Pills, nor did every warrior concern themselves with tempering their flesh.

The Annihilation Void Grand Array could be said to be the nemesis of almost all warriors; even a Void King Realm expert falling into it would not escape humiliation.

Though the great array was mighty, Annihilation Crystal was exceedingly rare and seldom seen.

Yet here there was an Annihilation Crystal vein, and from the crystals exposed on the rock face, the vein was actually a rich deposit!

Veins were divided into three grades—rich, ordinary, and poor—with distinct appraisal standards.

Generally, a vein of rich grade would allow one to casually mine corresponding minerals whose value would be astonishing, and such veins were extremely scarce.

Yang Kai had not expected to discover a rich Annihilation Crystal vein here.

The Stone Puppet had already rushed forward and began devouring them in great gulps; in a short time it had swallowed countless Annihilation Crystals into its belly.

Yang Kai did not hesitate either and surged forward to scavenge.

Although Saint Yuan was greatly suppressed here by the influence of the Annihilation Crystal, Yang Kai's body strength was immense, and his mining speed was only marginally slower than the Stone Puppet's.

In less than a day he had mined at least five hundred Annihilation Crystals, and the amount swallowed by the Stone Puppet was simply incalculable.

Five hundred Annihilation Crystals were already enough to lay an array that could cover a small Sect, but no Sect would be foolish enough to do that; if they truly did, disciples would have no need to cultivate in the future.

If they could not sense any Spiritual Qi at all, what would be the point of cultivating?

Annihilation Crystal was especially suitable for arranging formations in certain locations, such as a forbidden ground, or… traps!

The vein within the mountain showed no signs of diminishing, and when Yang Kai released his Divine Sense he could not help but sigh; for one person alone, the thought of completely exploiting this rich vein was simply impractical.

He might have to linger here for several years to accomplish it.

After a moment's consideration, Yang Kai did not continue; he summoned the Stone Puppet and, taking it with him, left the mountain to continue exploring ahead.

Another day later, guided by the Stone Puppet's uncanny sense, Yang Kai arrived at another mountain range; looking into its interior, even the well-traveled Yang Kai could not help but exclaim, "Heavenly Hook Jade!"

This turned out to be a Heavenly Hook Jade vein that could nurture soul power.

Heavenly Hook Jade was a very special kind of jade, emerald-green in color. When stimulated with Saint Yuan, it could release a gentle power that nourished the Sea of Consciousness and strengthened a cultivator’s Divine Soul.

This property was somewhat similar to the Warm Spirit Lotus, but its effectiveness was far inferior to the Warm Spirit Lotus.

The Warm Spirit Lotus could exist within a warrior's Sea of Consciousness, constantly nourishing the soul; Yang Kai's strong soul power was due to the Warm Spirit Lotus's years of nourishment.

But the Warm Spirit Lotus was, after all, a treasure of the heavens and earth—how could it be obtained casually? Even Void King Realm experts coveted such an item.

Heavenly Hook Jade was different; although much lower in rank than the Warm Spirit Lotus, it was still extremely precious and the best material for cultivating soul power. On each star's market, Heavenly Hook Jade occasionally appeared and was always snatched up by warriors.

Heavenly Hook Jade was a precious cultivation material that had value but little supply!

Yet here, a Heavenly Hook Jade vein actually existed.

From the scattered jade-green glow, this Heavenly Hook Jade vein was not particularly rich, but it was by no means barren; it was of normal grade.

As usual, while Yang Kai was dazed, the Stone Puppet had already begun devouring the Heavenly Hook Jade.

Yang Kai didn’t collect too many — after gathering just over a hundred pieces of Heavenly Hook Jade, he stopped, called out to the Stone Puppet, and, despite its obvious reluctance, took it along to continue their exploration.

He vaguely felt that this Dead Star he had stumbled upon might conceal unimaginable wealth!

Three days later Yang Kai discovered yet another vein of Phoenix Tear Azure Iron.

A month later, the veins Yang Kai had found had already numbered eight, and among them one was even a Saint Crystal vein!

He did not continue exploring; the month of searching had already made him vaguely realize that this Dead Star was definitely a mining star.

Every Cultivation Star had its own heaven-and-earth laws; these laws were broadly similar yet held subtle differences.

Those differences would cause the resources produced on each Cultivation Star to vary greatly.

Perhaps some stars were suited to the growth of medicines; such stars were called Medicine Stars.

Medicinal herbs that normally took a hundred years to mature might on such a Medicine Star take only fifty, thirty, or even ten years—greatly shortening their growth time.

Other stars were suited to the birth of minerals; those stars were mining stars.

On a mining star, rare minerals were countless, of dazzling variety and extreme abundance.

Among the most powerful forces in the Star Domain, several controlled a number of mining stars and Medicine Stars; for example, Xue Yue's Hengluo Commerce Guild possessed more than one mining star and Medicine Star, and because of such backing the Hengluo Commerce Guild could conduct business across the Star Domain and gain wide renown.

The Dead Star Yang Kai had found was undoubtedly a mining star, and judging from the number and quality of the veins, even among mining stars this one ranked among the top.

This was a windfall!

If Lingxiao Sect could seize control of this mining star, how could it not grow and prosper?

Yang Kai's feelings surged, and he was, unusually, somewhat excited.

He did not hesitate and immediately began arranging a Space Array in the Saint Crystal vein where he stood, linking it to the array in the valley on the surface.

Because he was not setting up a cross-star superlong-distance Space Array, progress was naturally much faster; within about a day Yang Kai completed the array, stood within it, inserted a Saint Crystal into the formation foundation's groove, and with a flash of white light he had already arrived at the surface valley.

Wasting no time, Yang Kai again took out a Saint Crystal, placed it into the Great Space Array at his feet, locked his Divine Sense onto the light point representing Dark Star within the formation, and activated the array.
