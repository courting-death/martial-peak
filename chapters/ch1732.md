## Chapter 1732 — Unexpected Attack

Ten days later, on the former ruins a stretch of contiguous houses had already been built; because this was to be a long-term encampment, the two sects' disciples had spared no effort when constructing them, leaving nothing to chance.

These houses did not look particularly exquisite, but they were extremely practical; living in them felt like residing in one's own Sect, except the surrounding Spiritual Qi was somewhat lacking.

But that was no great problem—if one truly wanted to cultivate, one could rely on Saint Crystals.

Along the ruined roads, luminous pearls hung at intervals, emitting a gentle glow that lit up the once pitch-black ruins until they were brilliantly illuminated and bustling with life.

Yang Kai had already told Qian Tong and Ye Xijun the locations of the eight veins he had explored; he was too lazy to worry about how the two sects would mine them—naturally, Qian Tong and Ye Xijun would take charge of supporting that.

If more manpower was needed, they could at any time be supplemented from Dark Star; Yang Kai had arranged everything for them.

Not only that, once everything here was in order and the disciples began extracting minerals, Yang Kai went out alone again and set up three more Space Arrays at different points within ten million li of this area!

In the coming decades, these Space Arrays that Yang Kai had arranged would guarantee that warriors coming from Dark Star could move about easily and conveniently within that ten million li radius.

A month later, Yang Kai prepared to leave.

After all, his original intention had been to open a channel between Dark Star and the outside world; discovering this mining star had simply been an incidental gain.

Since things had already settled into a normal course, there was no point in him staying.

Standing on the ruins, Yang Kai called for Stone Puppet in his mind!

He had not taken the Stone Puppet back because this place was simply a paradise for it; by devouring various rare minerals the Stone Puppet could strengthen itself, and if it consumed enough of the same kind of mineral it might even evolve a divine ability of its own.

For example, its Lava Armor!

It had obtained that power by devouring and refining the Sun’s True Fire.

Once the Lava Armor appeared, no one could approach within ten zhang; the scorching heat was enough to make even Origin Returning Realm experts retreat in fear.

In any case, the mining star contained an enormous amount of minerals, and no matter how much the Stone Puppet devoured it still couldn't consume that much. So during this period Yang Kai didn't pay it much attention.

But when he called the Stone Puppet this time, he discovered that it had tunneled down into the earth to who knew how many tens of thousands of zhang and he didn't know whether it had found something good.

Sensing Yang Kai's call, the Stone Puppet lazily popped up from below.

An hour later, the Stone Puppet reappeared before Yang Kai.

But at a glance Yang Kai was taken aback.

For the Stone Puppet's condition seemed somewhat off.

Before the Stone Puppet had grown larger it had always been blockish and dull, with a simple, foolish look; because its intelligence was low this was evident at first sight, but now it seemed even more dazed, and the original trace of spirit in its eyes had vanished.

When it walked it wobbled and staggered, swaying like someone drunk.

Yang Kai was startled, thinking the Stone Puppet had eaten something it shouldn't and something had gone wrong, but when he probed it carefully he was surprised to find that the Stone Puppet had not suffered any accident—its physical condition was better than ever.

Moreover, Yang Kai detected a peculiar, eerie force within its body.

This force was strangely familiar, like the heavenly law that had shrouded Dark Star when he refined that star's Stellar Origin and became its Star Lord.

"Law power?" Yang Kai's face changed greatly and he hurriedly probed more carefully.

After a while he withdrew his Divine Sense with a face of unsettled expression.

He had not been mistaken—the Stone Puppet truly contained a trace of law-power, though it was extremely slight; compared to Dark Star's law it was a world apart.

But law was law; it was a domain that even the Void King Realm could not reach!

How could a trace of the power of law have inexplicably been born within the Stone Puppet?

Recalling where it had been before, Yang Kai's eyes brightened and an audacious conjecture surged into his mind: "Did you devour and refine the Stellar Origin of this Dead Star? It actually still had an Origin?"

The Stone Puppet raised its hazy eyes to look at Yang Kai with a baffled expression, then lifted one foot, spun several times in place, crashed to the ground, and sent up a spray of dust.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh and cry at the same time. Sensing that the Stone Puppet was not in any real danger — merely experiencing some discomfort from being unable to fully digest that faint trace of Law Power — he simply put it away into his Spatial Ring.

But this matter still greatly surprised Yang Kai.

Moreover, for such a Dead Star to still retain some Origin was indeed astonishing.

A Dead Star could not possibly contain an Origin—without Spiritual Qi there were no heavenly laws and thus naturally no Origin, just as when a person died their body decayed and their Dao perished.

Yet there were always exceptions.

According to Yang Kai's prior speculation, that Dead Star had once been extremely fertile but had gradually died over hundreds of millions of years; if it still retained some Origin, it was not entirely impossible.

Apparently the Stone Puppet had gone deep into the subterranean depths and refined that remaining sliver of Origin.

That was luck for it—had it been the Origin of a true Cultivation Star the Stone Puppet would have been utterly incapable of refining it.

This kind of refining was completely different from how Yang Kai had refined Dark Star when he became its Star Lord. Between a Star Lord and a Cultivation Star there was an intimate, shared destiny; after Yang Kai became Star Lord, Dark Star's Origin remained connected to him in a mysterious way, granting him many conveniences others could not have.

But the Stone Puppet had simply devoured and absorbed it; the Origin it refined was gone, becoming only capital for its own strengthening.

Those thoughts passed through Yang Kai's mind and he confirmed his conjecture was probably correct.

Since the Stone Puppet was fine, Yang Kai no longer worried; after saying a word to Qian Tong and Ye Xijun, he left the mining star and continued on his journey.

Traveling through the Star Domain was lonely and monotonous, especially since there were no Cultivation Stars nearby at all.

By consulting the Star Chart Yang Kai confirmed the nearest Cultivation Star was at least a year's journey away.

He was not impatient; sometimes he landed on a drifting meteorite to cultivate while letting it carry him forward.

At other times he would head to some Dead Star to see if he could find anything else.

But the thing about Dead Stars was they were dead—Yang Kai examined many without finding anything. The last major discovery had really been a fluke.

That sort of accident wouldn't happen twice.

However, on one Dead Star he passed by he left a concealed Great Space Array that connected with one he had set previously.

During this time the Stone Puppet had been sleeping soundly in his Spatial Ring without the slightest movement, but Yang Kai keenly noticed an extra thick, impurity-like layer had formed around its exterior, slowly enveloping it and taking on the appearance of a stone cocoon.

Just as it had been before the Stone Puppet was born.

Could the Stone Puppet still evolve? Yang Kai felt dubious yet excited, eager to see what changes would occur the day it broke free of the cocoon.

And he himself had sensed a barrier during his cultivation in these days.

That was the shackles of the Void King Realm! Only by breaking through that barrier could one attain the exalted Void King Realm.

At a time like this, if he could find a Cultivation Star to seclude himself for a year or so, Yang Kai was confident he could attempt to break through and see whether he could successfully ascend.

That day Yang Kai habitually checked on the Stone Puppet's condition.

Because the Stone Puppet had shown no signs for a year, he checked on it from time to time; until now there had been nothing unusual, but this time he clearly felt the Stone Puppet was about to break out of its cocoon.

Filled with joy, Yang Kai wanted to find a place to stay for a while to wait for the Stone Puppet to complete its evolution.

After surveying the surroundings he shot straight toward a nearby Meteorite Sea.

This Meteorite Sea hovered quietly in the void and showed no sign of movement, making it a perfect place to stop.

But as Yang Kai approached the Meteorite Sea his brow suddenly twitched.

He detected the presence of living beings hidden within the Meteorite Sea, and there was more than one; although concealed, each aura was extremely powerful—indeed, they were all Origin Returning Realm experts.

Thanks to the strength of Yang Kai's Divine Sense he had managed to notice them; otherwise he might never have detected them.

This group hid furtively here, clearly with some scheme afoot.

Yang Kai felt extremely unlucky and, not wanting to be dragged into some murky affair, turned to leave.

But no sooner had he moved than a flash of radiance suddenly flickered in the distance, and then a blade-like beam shot directly from behind a meteorite.

That radiance carried unimaginable, terrifying power; even from dozens of li away it arrived in an instant, making Yang Kai feel his skin tighten with danger.

"Void King Realm!" Yang Kai's face darkened—hidden within the Meteorite Sea was a Void King Realm expert! He had not even sensed them before.

Although with his current strength he was almost unrivaled below the Void King Realm, he still did not dare to be careless before a Void King Realm opponent.

The Void King Realm and the Origin Returning Realm were fundamentally different existences; otherwise so many Third Stage Origin Returning Realm experts would not be stuck at the Void King Realm's gate their whole lives unable to advance.

The other party erupted into action suddenly, clearly intending to kill Yang Kai with a single blow.

But the attacker had underestimated Yang Kai's skill; facing such a terrifying strike, Yang Kai let out a long cry, waved his hand, and over a hundred Golden Blood Threads condensed from his own Golden Blood shot forth—these hundred Golden Blood Threads twisted and writhed, interweaving with each other to directly form a dazzling golden shield behind Yang Kai!
