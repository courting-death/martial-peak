## Chapter 236 — New Uses for Beast Soul Techniques

As soon as Jin Hao's voice fell, a figure emerged from the concealed, dim forest.

The audacity of the person to appear so fearlessly made Jin Hao tense up, his expression turning grave as he secretly prepared for a confrontation. He thought that, just as he had suspected before, he had encountered a formidable opponent.

However, when that person's appearance came into view, Jin Hao's expression instantly turned to one of shock, his eyes wide with disbelief.

Yang Kai gave him a cold smirk, feeling utterly helpless inside.

The other party had identified his hiding spot at a glance; what was the point of hiding any longer? Rather than being forced out, it was better to walk out openly.

With a sweep of his gaze, Yang Kai furrowed his brow, instantly discerning many things.

“It’s you!” Jin Hao exclaimed, “How could you… how could you possibly be…”

“Still alive?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

“Indeed, how could you still be alive?” Jin Hao's voice turned low.

More than half a year ago, three disciples from Ghost King Valley had pursued Yang Kai. Yu Chengkun was the fastest, chasing Yang Kai ahead, while Jin Hao and Leng Shan followed closely. However, when they reached a cliff, they sensed Yu Chengkun's death.

At that time, Jin Hao had thought that Yang Kai had dragged Yu Chengkun down the cliff to perish together, yet he never expected to meet him again after such a long time. This time, the disciple from Lingxiao Pavilion not only looked well but was also much stronger than he had been over half a year ago.

“Why can’t I be alive?” Yang Kai scoffed.

“Didn’t you fall off that cliff?” Jin Hao pondered a possibility.

“I did fall, but I climbed back up. By the way, your junior brother wasn’t so lucky; he fell to the bottom and became a pile of meat paste, with no place to be buried. Quite tragic,” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

The intention behind his words was merely to disturb Jin Hao’s state of mind and provoke his anger, but to Yang Kai's surprise, Jin Hao remained indifferent, only sneering at him.

If it had been more than half a year ago, Jin Hao would have indeed been furious, but now, with his life in someone else's hands, he had no leisure to worry about others.

Noticing Jin Hao's cold indifference, Yang Kai frowned and glanced at the three powerful Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts nearby. He sneered, “So you’ve betrayed your sect and allied with those from Tianlang Kingdom.”

These three Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts were of different kinds, and it was clear they could coexist peacefully only because someone was enslaving them.

Jin Hao did not possess such ability; only those from Tianlang Kingdom could enslave Demonic Beasts.

“What do you know?” Jin Hao, feeling a mix of shame and anger, shouted at Yang Kai, “You know nothing! Don’t sit here and spout nonsense about me! If you have time to waste, you should take care of yourself first!”

With a wave of his hand, Jin Hao commanded, “Kill him!”

Yang Kai's expression tightened as he warily stared at the three Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts.

To his surprise, the three Demonic Beasts merely showed their teeth at Yang Kai, demonstrating their hostility, but they did not heed Jin Hao's command to attack.

“Damn it, you filthy bitch!” Jin Hao couldn't help but curse. Zi Mo had ordered the three Demonic Beasts to follow him, yet they did not obey his commands. What use were they?

“Hahaha…” Seeing this comical scene, Yang Kai couldn't help but burst into laughter.

Jin Hao's face turned a mix of red and green, resembling a dye shop, and Yang Kai's mockery, combined with his current predicament, made him utterly furious. His fists crackled as he grinned menacingly at Yang Kai, “Laugh while you can; soon you won’t have the chance to laugh anymore.”

As he spoke, two ghostly claws, icy winds swirling around them, lunged toward Yang Kai with a bone-chilling coldness. 

Wherever the ghostly claws swept past, a ghostly light flickered, and an unbearable chill spread around Yang Kai, constantly eroding his body.

Yang Kai's expression grew serious as he urged his Yuan Qi, resisting the encroaching chill while fending off the attack.

There was a significant gap in their realms; Jin Hao's strength was around the Fifth Stage of True Yuan Realm, two stages higher than Qi Jianxing, but in terms of combat power, they were not too far apart.

After all, their backgrounds were different; Qi Jianxing came from the prestigious Jiu Xing Sword Sect, while Jin Hao was merely from the second-rate Ghost King Valley.

Thus, even though Yang Kai seemed to be at a disadvantage, he would not face immediate danger.

During this past month, he had also made considerable progress.

The only thing Yang Kai worried about was the three Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts lurking nearby!

Each of these Demonic Beasts was formidable, and if they all rushed at him, he would have no choice but to flee.

However, after fighting for a while, Yang Kai was surprised to find that the three Demonic Beasts merely watched from the sidelines, showing no intention of intervening. His courage grew a little, and as he maneuvered, his strength gradually increased, reaching the peak of the Separation and Union Realm.

Jin Hao was ruthless, launching fierce attacks, releasing all the anger he had accumulated over the past month. He had completely forgotten that Zi Mo had tasked him with capturing Yang Kai, instead adopting a stance of not killing Yang Kai until he was satisfied.

Taking full advantage, in just a short time, Jin Hao had already left over a dozen wounds on Yang Kai. Though they were not life-threatening, they had drawn a considerable amount of blood.

“Hey, kid, you’re definitely dead today!” During the fierce battle, Jin Hao still had the energy to taunt, sneering.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth, throwing a punch and quickly retreating while Jin Hao was on guard.

Suddenly, he raised both palms and slammed them together.

Two waves of soul-stirring energy surged forth. Sensing the lethal intent hidden within this move, Jin Hao also prepared himself.

The sounds of tiger roars and cow moos echoed as Yang Kai unleashed the Beast Soul Technique.

With a thrust of his palms, two vividly red figures shot out like thunder.

Jin Hao's expression changed drastically as he hurriedly retreated. Faced with the assault of the two Demonic Beasts, he no longer dared to hold back. His True Yuan surged to its limit, and he unleashed his killing moves.

Yang Kai, however, cursed inwardly and attacked in unison with the two Beast Souls.

Although the Beast Soul Technique was successfully executed, it was not what Yang Kai had intended. Over the past month, he had explored another use for the Beast Soul Technique, hoping for a successful strike to catch Jin Hao off guard, but fate had not favored him, and he could only give up for now.

Jin Hao was indeed a master at the Fifth Stage of True Yuan Realm. Even with Yang Kai and the two Beast Souls attacking together, they could only manage to hold their ground, fighting evenly with him.

Moments later, the two Beast Souls exhausted their energy and vanished.

Seizing this opportunity, Jin Hao charged forward, grinning maliciously, “Kid, you’re dead for sure!”

Yang Kai's expression grew serious as he raised his palms once more.

Seeing this familiar motion, Jin Hao was alarmed; he did not want to face those two intangible yet difficult-to-deal-with Beast Souls again. He immediately brought out his trump card.

With a wail of ghosts and howls of wolves, a stream of black energy suddenly shot from Jin Hao's palm, forming a twisted human face that roared ferociously, mixed with overwhelming killing intent and malevolent aura. It charged toward Yang Kai like a vengeful spirit.

This scene felt eerily familiar.

On that day, when Yu Chengkun and Yang Kai both fell off the cliff, the latter had also used such a technique.

Seeing the human face, Yang Kai felt a surge of joy! He had been waiting for Jin Hao to use this move, but he never expected it would only happen now.

With a faint smile on his lips, Yang Kai remained unmoved, his body steady as if he had not seen anything.

With a clap and a push, the two energies in his palms miraculously fused into one.

There was no White Tiger, no Divine Ox, and no beast roar—only a beam of ghostly light shot out.

Jin Hao tilted his body, effortlessly dodging.

In an instant, this ghostly light drilled into the body of a nearby Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast behind Jin Hao! It stirred no ripples at all.

It succeeded! Yang Kai was overjoyed.

Jin Hao, however, was furious, shouting, “You little brat, trying to scare me, Jin Hao?”

Having just suffered losses from the two Beast Souls, he was somewhat paranoid. Seeing Yang Kai adopt that stance and even bring out his trump card, he did not expect the opponent to merely be making a show. There was no trace of the Beast Souls, which made him furious.

As soon as his words fell, Jin Hao suddenly felt a jolt in his mind, a sharp pain shooting through his head, and his complexion turned pale. His True Yuan became chaotic, and he retreated in shock, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief, “You… you were unaffected by the Ghost King Seal, how is that possible?”

Just a moment ago, Jin Hao had clearly felt that his Ghost King Seal had vanished.

Just like the backlash Yu Chengkun experienced that day, Jin Hao was now also suffering from a significant backlash.

“Hey, now you’re definitely dead!” Yang Kai took a deep breath, grinning wickedly.

“How could you possibly dispel the Ghost King Seal?” Jin Hao's face was filled with inexplicable shock, unaware that within Yang Kai, Di Mo was currently feasting joyfully, thoroughly satisfied.

The Ghost King Seal was, in essence, a wisp of a vengeful spirit, nurtured by the disciples of Ghost King Valley with True Yuan and blood, a life-and-death bond, making it a delectable meal for Di Mo.

“Go ask your junior brother in the underworld; he died the same way.” As he spoke, Yang Kai extended his hand, and a blood-red long sword formed from Yang Liquid.

The technique in his hands was incredibly sharp; those white ghostly claws were as hard as iron, comparable to the sturdiness and sharpness of an Upper-Level Common-Grade secret treasure. Against such an enemy, using a weapon formed from Yang Liquid was the best choice.

Although Jin Hao still had the strength to fight, the inexplicable disappearance of the Ghost King Seal left him shaken. He no longer dared to clash with Yang Kai and hurriedly retreated.

However, just as he took three steps back, a killing intent surged from behind him. Jin Hao's expression changed drastically; before he could turn around, he sensed a wave of bloody wind, followed by a sharp pain in his neck.

Falling to the ground, Jin Hao struggled desperately, catching a glimpse of a Demonic Beast that had followed him, gnawing at his flesh. His heart sank to the depths of despair as he roared to the heavens, “Zi Mo, you filthy bitch!”

He thought it was Zi Mo trying to kill him.

In a life-and-death situation, Jin Hao unleashed all his strength, finally shaking off the gnawing of the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, scrambling to his feet, only to feel a bloody mess at his neck, blood flowing incessantly.

Just as he steadied himself, Yang Kai had already arrived with his sword drawn.

The blood-red long sword came crashing down. Jin Hao hurriedly raised his hand to block, and those white ghostly hands were indeed hard. Even after taking a sword strike, they only cracked open a seam without being severed.

In the blink of an eye, the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast pounced back, flanking Jin Hao from both sides. With his spirit damaged and heavily injured, Jin Hao had lost a significant portion of his strength, leaving him no match for Yang Kai.
