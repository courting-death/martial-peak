## Chapter 700 — One Old and One Young

"Master, is this Fuyun City?" the young man asked, eyes gleaming as he took in the crowds below.

"Yes. The name remains, but everything else has changed—so much has shifted in a thousand years," the old man sighed.

"And that peak over there is where Wangtian Cliff stands?" the youth asked again, gazing toward the mountains several li distant.

"Correct. The Thousand-Year Demon Flower will bloom atop that very summit," the old man nodded slightly. "Zhai Yao, the reason I brought you here this time is precisely for that blooming. Since the day you were born you've followed me, training in the wilds; you know nothing of worldly ways. When you arrive, do not cause trouble, and be wary of the treachery of human hearts."

"Disciple understands." The young man bowed respectfully. "But Master, you once condensed the medicinal elixir from the Thousand-Year Demon Flower—could you tell me more about its situation? I'm very curious."

The old man smiled faintly. "Some things cannot be put into words; when the day comes you'll understand. For now, let's first pay our respects to the city lord. If memory serves, the current lord should be the third-generation descendant of an old friend of mine."

"Master, please go slowly." Zhai Yao attentively supported the old man as they walked down from the void.

Many in the city clicked their tongues in surprise as they watched the old man and youth, though few gave them prolonged attention—Fuyun City now saw too many cultivators coming and going. The old man looked frail and on the verge of death, yet from him emanated the calm aura of a true powerhouse.

At the city lord's manor, strongers of the human, yao, and demon clans had gathered.

The city lord, Ao Gu, was a demon clansman; the deputy lords Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao were respectively human and of the yao—each of them a Saint Realm strong.

Every three years the three of them held a contest to determine the lordship; the two who lost would take the positions of deputy lords, jointly overseeing Fuyun City.

At this moment the three races were deliberating grave matters: the Thousand-Year Demon Flower was about to bloom, the city teemed with people, and they needed arrangements to prevent any chaos that might shake the very foundations of Fuyun City.

Moreover, at such a critical juncture they would not permit any Saint Realm strongers to set foot within a hundred li of Fuyun City.

The Thousand-Year Demon Flower was the symbol of Fuyun City and the root of its prosperity. In the thousand years when the demon flower did not bloom, many came to admire the grandeur of Wangtian Cliff; the comings and goings of these cultivators brought abundant revenue to the city.

For this reason they treated the matter with utmost gravity, determined that when the flower bloomed no Saint Realm stronger's presence would disturb it.

While they were discussing, a yao guard hurried in and bowed: "Lord Ao Gu, there is an old man outside who wishes to see you!"

"An old man?" Ao Gu's brow tightened; displeased, he waved a hand. "Do not admit him. Send him away."

The guard did not leave. Stammering, he said, "But Lord, he claims to have known Senior Ao Si Du, and asked me to deliver this to you."

Ao Gu's face changed abruptly; he rose at once. "He knew my grandfather?"

He furrowed his brow and demanded, "What is it? Present it."

The guard quickly handed over the item. Ao Gu glanced at it; his expression shifted, unsettled, as memories stirred. After a long moment he put the thing away and told Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao, "Gentlemen, that will do for today. I must go receive someone."

"As you wish, City Lord." Zhou Liang inclined his head.

After Ao Gu left, Jin Jiao looked toward the doorway with a thoughtful air and said in a low voice, "Brother Li, if this man truly knew Ao Gu's grandfather, wouldn't that mean he's lived for nearly a thousand years?"

Zhou Liang shot him a glance. "Are there so few ancient, monster-class strongers in this world?"

Jin Jiao laughed softly. "Not few, but those connected to the Ao Gu family are rare. Did you notice what the guard brought in? It was the Ao Gu family token—only those who have rendered great service to the family qualify for one. As far as I know, the Ao Gu line has only ever issued three such tokens down the ages. Two are in demon hands, kept by Ao Gu's retainers; one rests in human hands."

"The visitor is human!" Zhou Liang declared. He had not sensed any strong Yao aura outside the manor.

"That makes the matter more serious," Jin Jiao's expression shifted.

"How so?"

"Do you know which human strongers possess the Ao Gu family token?"

Zhou Liang pondered, his voice grave. "For the Ao Gu family to hand out a family token, the recipient among the humans must be extraordinary."

The enmity between human, yao, and demons ran deep; the three rarely mixed save in the Neutral Domain. The Ao Gu family was no small clan—someone who rendered such enormous service would be a figure with heavenly reach.

"Brother Jin, I know none of those hidden truths; if you do know, by all means speak up," Zhou Liang said.

Jin Jiao looked about, leaned close, and whispered a few words.

Zhou Liang's face underwent a drastic change. "Truly?"

"No mistake," Jin Jiao nodded heavily.

"If it really is him..." The two men could no longer contain themselves; they rose and hurried off, closely tracking Ao Gu's steps.

Outside the manor, Ao Gu hurried to meet them. When he saw the old man before him he was stunned for a long moment, then his face fell into reverent respect as he performed a deep salute: "I did not expect it to be you, Elder. Forgive my poor welcome."

Several guards nearly stared their eyes out.

The demon clan was fierce and domineering; its strongers never bowed readily, and Ao Gu was no exception—over the years none had ever seen the city lord so deferential to an arriving guest.

And the guest was a human!

What sort of background did this old fellow have to make Ao Gu abase himself?

The guards were momentarily uneasy and bewildered.

The old man chuckled softly. "Many years gone. The young man of old has grown. Rare that you still recall my face. So, how fares Ao Si Du now?"

Ao Gu's expression dimmed. "My grandfather passed away a century ago."

The old man sighed faintly. "Old friends are all gone. Only this old, undying one still clings to life, alas."

"You speak too humbly, Elder. Your presence is a blessing to the three races," Ao Gu said.

"Ha. I'm old. Truly not what I once was." The old man slowly shook his head.

Ao Gu's gaze flicked toward the young man at the old man's side, a hint of suspicion on his face. "This young brother is...?"

"Disciple Zhai Yao greets you, Elder. I am my master's disciple," the youth said with a respectful salute, giving his name.

Ao Gu's eyes brightened; his countenance stirred with excitement. "Senior has taken disciples?"

The old man nodded. "I'm near the end; I want to pass on the legacy. This child has good talent, so I kept him by my side to instruct him."

"Young sir, your luck is indeed extraordinary—being accepted by such a person as Master would make many in the world envious," Ao Gu murmured with feeling.

He also noticed that Zhai Yao was of the yao race!

Yet the Yao aura within him was hidden to perfection; one without sufficient power would not detect it.

Ao Gu admired the elder's magnanimity—born a human yet having accepted a Yao as his closed-door disciple—an act few could accomplish, and perhaps proof that in his heart the three races held no true division.

It was precisely this view that had won him the admiration of the world.

For a time the atmosphere turned solemn and respectful.

As they spoke, Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao hurried out of the manor and came before the old man, cupping hands in greeting: "We pay respects, Elder."

"You two should be the deputy lords Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao, yes?" the old man asked with a faint smile.

"Indeed. Your sight is sharp, Elder." Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao instantly glowed with pride—few expected such a figure to know their names.

"Very good," the old man nodded approvingly. "Under your joint governance Fuyun City prospers. It seems you both have labored much. If only there were more like you who could discard the chasms between races—then all under heaven might be one family. I wonder if in my lifetime I will live to see such a sight."

"We shall endeavor to do so." Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao hurried to promise. "We cannot speak for the world, but in Fuyun City, Elder, you will see it."

"Heh. Then I will watch with interest." The old man smiled slightly.

"Please, Elder, come inside and speak," Ao Gu hastened to invite, clearly not wanting Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao to monopolize the guest's attention.

The old man nodded and strode in, Zhai Yao lovingly supporting him.

Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao exchanged a glance and quickly followed, both considering whether to seize this chance to ask the elder to refine several Saint Pills for them.

Inside the manor Ao Gu arranged a lavish feast to welcome the elder and Zhai Yao—fine wines, rare delicacies, spirit fruits, and jade nectars filled the table.

The old man only nibbled a few spirit fruits and fell silent; Zhai Yao, however, ate ravenously, opening his stomach and gorging.

Seeing this, Zhou Liang and Jin Jiao lowered themselves and pressed wine to Zhai Yao repeatedly.

After several rounds of drinking, Ao Gu inquired, "Elder, have you also come for the Thousand-Year Demon Flower this time?"

"Yes." The old man nodded. "But rest assured: I will not violate the rules nor harm anyone's interests. My main purpose is to bring this young disciple out to see the world."

"We trust your character," Ao Gu said with weighty nod.

Given the elder's standing, if he truly sought the Thousand-Year Demon Flower a single utterance would eliminate all rivals; when the time came the flower atop Wangtian Cliff would surely fall into his hands.

"I have no other intent," the old man said. "I only wish to ensure my disciple's safety. I do not wish to go to the trouble of finding another heir."

"Please rest assured, Elder. No one within Fuyun City will harm him—this I guarantee with my life!" Ao Gu stated emphatically.

"Then I shall ask that of you. As exchange," the old man added, "I can refine one Saint Pill for each of you three."

At these words Ao Gu and the others immediately became excited; they glanced at one another and vied, eager to state their requests.
