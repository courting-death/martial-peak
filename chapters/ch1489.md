## Chapter 1489 — Sudden Change

But now there was no easy way out; the five people's Saint Yuan had already gathered at the central spot, thick and potent, and if they ceased, unimaginable consequences would very likely occur.

Especially since the formation had a rebound attack; once such a massive amount of Saint Yuan were reflected back, no one could easily survive.

The old man surnamed Jiang furrowed his brow into a knot.

"Worry not, everyone. Although my cultivation is somewhat lower, when it comes to storing Saint Yuan, I believe I am not inferior to anyone, so just mind your own affairs." Seeing them each anxiously eyeing his side, Yang Kai knew full well what they were thinking and immediately spoke.

"Brazen words!" The burly man surnamed Chen snorted coldly, then quickly grinned: "But I admire it!"

"Good, that will do!" The old man Jiang finally relaxed, his eyes glittering like diamonds, dazzling and bright; he gritted his teeth and said, "Since Young Brother Yang has such faith in himself, I, this old man, will increase my Saint Yuan output—everyone, keep up!"

Saying so, he emitted a low shout, and the Saint Yuan surging from his hands did indeed grow much larger, increasing by a great degree—clearly intending to accomplish everything in a single strike.

He had earlier misjudged the sturdiness of this Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation and had not expected the breaking-time to last so long, so he had hoped to finish it quickly; the only way was to raise the Saint Yuan output to saturate the formation's bearing capacity in a short time, causing it to collapse on its own.

Seeing this, the others dared not delay and all urged their Saint Yuan, increasing the speed and volume of infusion.

Yang Kai did the same.

For a time, Five Elements Saint Yuan poured massively into the void, converging and interweaving—at least twice as fast as before.

Seeing Yang Kai had not exaggerated his strength and could indeed keep pace, the other four could not help but relax; the old man Jiang showed a look of approval and nodded slightly.

But the good times did not last. As the Five Elements Saint Yuan continued to flow in, the sealing formation before them still showed no sign of breaking.

Everyone grew anxious.

After a while, the old man Jiang suddenly bit his tongue and spat a spray of blood mist; his formerly pale face flushed markedly.

He had employed some secret art to boost his strength.

The old man surnamed He, Burly Chen, and the comely Madam Yi each resorted to measures—either swallowing carefully hoarded Spiritual Pills, or using powerful secret techniques with aftereffects to maintain the operation of their Saint Yuan.

Only Yang Kai remained as before. He looked pale and on the verge of collapse, yet the Saint Yuan surging from his body did not diminish in the slightest.

The four could not help but look at him anew. No one knew just how much Saint Yuan this First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm youth truly harbored.

The tense, uneasy atmosphere slowly spread; everyone regretted rashly coming here and regretted trusting the old man Jiang's words too readily. But now, such regrets were clearly of no use.

Seeing that even exhausting their own Saint Yuan might well fail to break the formation, the old man surnamed He's eyes flashed with a ruthless light; he suddenly bellowed, "Everyone, it seems our strength cannot break this Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation. I have a beloved wife and will not accompany you—go and meet your fate!"

Faces changed drastically!

The old man Jiang shouted, "Brother He, what are you going to do?"

"You dare!" Burly Chen also roared.

But the old man He paid no heed; Saint Yuan within him erupted fiercely as he made a posture to step backward, clearly intending to withdraw from here.

If he delayed any longer, death was the only outcome. Rather than remain locked like this, abandoning now might still leave a sliver of hope.

Of course, he must beware the formation's violent rebound upon abandonment.

Still, the one who gives up first always has more chances and time to run—after all, once chaos breaks out, the others will be too busy protecting themselves to care, and will end up taking most of the hits for him.

Of the five, only the burly man surnamed Chen and the beautiful woman surnamed Yi were husband and wife, bound by close ties. The others were mere chance acquaintances, joining forces only because the formation required it—there was not the slightest bond between them. For the old man surnamed He, who now fought for his own life, how could he possibly care whether the others lived or died?

When disaster came, birds in the same forest flew different ways; all the more so for five people who had only just met.

The fragile alliance collapsed the instant the old man Chen spoke.

Alarmed, the others quickly understood Chen's plan and likewise pulled back, preparing to leave.

But the next moment, everyone's faces changed, including Yang Kai's, who had been hiding his strength.

For at that time no one could move an inch; a strange power from the void at the very center froze them in place, and Saint Yuan within them continued to uncontrollably pour into the void.

The five-elemental interwoven energy, turning, seemed to generate a tremendous suction, not only drawing in their bodies but continuously devouring the power inside them.

Earlier, while they actively delivered Saint Yuan, they had not noticed, but now when they tried to pull back, they immediately discovered it.

"What's happening?" The old man He's face changed in alarm; he twisted his body hard but still could not move, his face ashen and sensing grave danger.

"Old Jiang, what is the meaning of this?" The hot-tempered burly Chen turned his fury toward the old man Jiang, shouting at him, clearly thinking he had set a trap.

Not only he thought so—Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as he glanced at Jiang and saw that he, too, was pale and panicked.

He, too, was taken aback by the sudden change.

"I don't know either!" The old man Jiang wore a wronged expression.

"You don't know?" Burly Chen pressed on, "You were the one who discovered this place and brought us here; you provided the way to break the formation—now you dare say you don't know? Did you set a trap for us to jump into?"

"Humph, Brother Chen, that is unreasonable! This old man is hardly safe himself—what benefit would I gain?" The old man Jiang, though mild-mannered, could not help but retort when slandered.

"Regardless, this matter was caused by you. If you do not think of a way, Chen will not let you off in the afterlife!"

"Stop arguing!" Yang Kai barked softly. "Is there any point to arguing now? I believe Old Jiang isn't aware of this!"

"You believe?" Burly Chen sneered. "Who knows whether you and this old fellow are in cahoots?"

Yang Kai coldly glanced at him and refused to engage further; the man was simple-minded and not given to thinking—now trapped, panicking, continued bickering would only worsen the situation and help no one.

"Old Jiang, could the Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation change like this?" Yang Kai frowned at the old man Jiang.

"No!" Old Jiang shook his head decisively. "The Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation is only a defensive array; apart from its rebound special effect it has no killing power. It would never change like this unless—"

"Unless what?" Yang Kai's eyes narrowed.

"Unless the formation has already transformed into another formation!" Old Jiang guessed inwardly, carefully recalling the formation lore he knew as he spoke.

He could find the way to break the Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation, so he clearly had some knowledge of formations; even if far inferior to Yang Yan, he was by no means comparable to the other four.

On further thought, Old Jiang's face changed again as he exclaimed, "Could this be the Five Elements Soul-Siphoning Formation?"

"The Five Elements Soul-Siphoning Formation?" The comely Madam Yi cried out in puzzlement, asking, "It differs from the Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation by only one word—what is the difference?"

"Heh..." Old Jiang gave a bitter smile. "Though only one character off, the power is incomparable. As you can see, Madam Yi, once this formation is triggered it will not rest until death; it will not only devour our Saint Yuan clean, it will not spare even our qi and blood."

"What?" The group all paled and fell into silence.

"That Master is truly malicious," Old Jiang said gloomily, his bitterness sharper than wormwood. "He set up a Five Elements Soul-Siphoning Formation beneath the cover of the Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation—this old man was careless."

"What's the use of saying that now? I don't want to die here!" Burly Chen shouted, frantically urging his Saint Yuan to break free of the formation's binding; no matter how he struggled there was no effect and his emotions grew more agitated.

"Do not act rashly. Being trapped in the Five Elements Soul-Siphoning Formation is like sinking into quickmud—the more you struggle, the faster your Saint Yuan drains," Old Jiang hastily warned.

"Then what should we do?" Madam Yi's face changed and she hurried to restrain her husband's recklessness.

Old Jiang smiled weakly, at a loss for words.

"Are we to simply wait for death?" The old man Chen's face turned thoroughly ashen.

"Old Jiang is sorry, everyone." Old Jiang wore a guilty expression; he had thought he was leading them to treasure and had even planned distribution, yet in the end all five had fallen into peril—unable to escape, forced to watch death approach.

"Is there truly no way? Old Jiang, you know more about formations than anyone here—think of something!" Madam Yi pleaded.

Old Jiang didn't even have the courage to meet her eyes; it seemed all hope had been exhausted.

He indeed had some knowledge of formations, but attempting to simultaneously break the two arrays before them was beyond his capability.

Only if he possessed Yang Yan's depth of formation knowledge could he have easily accomplished what now seemed impossible.

Yang Kai also wore a depressed look. Although his Saint Yuan reserves were vast, without dispelling the formation he would remain trapped here. Of course, he was not without some chance of escape.
