## Chapter 253 — Yan Shou Huan Fei

This was the truth; it was definitely not as convenient to control Yuan Qi through a layer of clothing as it was through direct contact with the body.

Han Xiao Qi blinked her eyelashes and softly said, “Junior Brother Yang is a gentleman, what are you afraid of?”

Ye Han stammered, “I’m not afraid… I… I… ah…”

Before she could finish her sentence, she dove into the embrace of Senior Sister Liu Qingru, hiding away.

Zi Mo snickered from the side, her laughter carrying a deep meaning, causing all the women to feel a bit uncomfortable.

“Everyone, quiet down!” Yang Kai glared at her, then extended a hand to cover the flat and smooth abdomen of Ye Qingsi.

As soon as he made contact, Ye Qingsi couldn’t help but shiver, her pearly teeth biting down, her watery eyes staring directly at Yang Kai as if trying to see into his heart.

The exposed skin also began to glow faintly with a layer of red light.

Yang Kai was unrestrained and guiltless, his roguish eyes wandering all over Ye Qingsi, his control over True Yang Yuan Qi reaching a level of mastery.

“You little rascal!” Ye Qingsi, unable to miss the changes in Yang Kai’s demeanor, saw his eyes darting around like a thief’s and couldn’t help but blush and scold him lightly.

“What’s there to see?” Yang Kai chuckled.

Indeed, there was nothing much to see; all the women wore binding garments, and Ye Qingsi hadn’t fully undressed. Even if Yang Kai wanted to look, there was no way.

“Shameless!” Ye Qingsi’s silver teeth nearly bit through her lip. Though she said this, there was still a hint of a smile on her face; she was amused by Yang Kai’s antics.

No man had ever dared to take such liberties with her.

“A gentleman, huh…” Zi Mo teased from the side, casting a casual glance at Han Xiao Qi, whose pretty face instantly turned crimson.

Earlier, she had wanted to use the label of gentleman to suppress Yang Kai, but unexpectedly, Yang Kai was completely unfazed by it. Han Xiao Qi finally understood what Yang Kai meant by “the nature of a man.”

In the face of beauty, which man wouldn’t take a few glances? If he were truly indifferent, that would be a problem.

Better to be outwardly unperturbed while harboring unspeakable thoughts than to be pretentious.

At least he was being true to himself, without the slightest pretense.

Thinking this, Han Xiao Qi let out a small sigh, considering it… as his reward!

Before long, a small bulge appeared at Ye Qingsi’s waist. Just as Yang Kai was about to take action, Ye Qingsi suddenly said, “Be careful! If you leave a scar, I won’t let you off!”

“What time is it, and you’re still worried about that!” Yang Kai replied, feeling speechless. He swiftly cut open a small incision, forcing out the Control Soul Insect and incinerating it.

“Next!” Yang Kai turned to the other women.

The women exchanged glances, hesitating for a long while, before Han Xiao Qi finally steeled herself and blushed as she said, “I’ll go!”

As the Senior Sister among the four of Wan Hua Palace, she felt she should set an example.

After saying that, she boldly sat in front of Yang Kai, unhurriedly unfastening her clothing, then closed her eyes and entered a meditative state!

Seeing her posture, Yang Kai was even less courteous.

One after another, he treated them.

Among the four of Wan Hua Palace, Han Xiao Qi’s elegance, Ye Han’s innocence, Liu Qingru’s charm, and Hua Ruoyin’s tranquility—all had different qualities.

Along with Ye Qingsi’s allure and Feng Qianhen’s liveliness, it was a feast for the eyes for Yang Kai.

Finally, it was Shu Xiaoyu’s turn.

When she sat in front of him, her face flushed as she was about to unfasten her clothing, but Yang Kai reached out to stop her.

“You don’t need to!”

“Isn’t it hard to control Yuan Qi?” Shu Xiaoyu asked softly.

“After so many attempts, it should be fine through clothing now,” Yang Kai explained.

Upon hearing this, Shu Xiaoyu couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief.

But it wasn’t over yet; Yang Kai tore off a piece of cloth from his own clothing and blindfolded himself.

Seeing this, Ye Han huffed angrily, “Why do you blindfold yourself when it’s Shu Xiaoyu’s turn?”

Yang Kai turned his head at the sound, “She has a man; if I don’t blindfold myself, Chen Xueshu will probably come looking for me to fight.”

“Oh.” Ye Han nodded in agreement, then laughed, “You’re quite considerate.”

“Of course… do you think I’m some kind of lecher?”

The expressions of the group of women turned a bit apologetic, feeling as if they had misunderstood Yang Kai.

While Han Xiao Qi was feeling guilty, her expression suddenly turned cold as she said, “Earlier… couldn’t you also blindfold yourself?”

To force out the Control Soul Insect, he only needed to use his hand and drive True Yang Yuan Qi; whether he could see or not was naturally irrelevant. She hadn’t thought of this before, but now seeing Yang Kai do this, Han Xiao Qi immediately became alert.

Yang Kai didn’t dare to answer, his face awkward.

Han Xiao Qi’s delicate body began to tremble.

The women exchanged glances, then suddenly burst into laughter, rushing forward to rain down a flurry of playful punches.

…

Half an hour later, the group of women, chattering and laughing, reunited with the others. Chen Xueshu was the first to rush over, grabbing his Junior Sister’s hand and anxiously asking, “How was it? How was it?”

Shu Xiaoyu recounted what had just happened.

Chen Xueshu looked at Yang Kai with tears of gratitude. Yang Kai’s actions to preserve his dignity and respect undoubtedly moved Chen Xueshu deeply.

When he looked up, he was shocked to see Yang Kai’s bruised and battered face, looking quite disheveled. He exclaimed, “Brother Yang, you…”

Yang Kai forced a smile, “Just a small injury, a small injury…”

“Deserved it!” Zi Mo gloated from the side.

Yang Kai didn’t care, thinking for a moment before taking out two bottles of Healing Pill from his Spatial Pouch and handing them to Chen Xueshu.

“What’s this for, Brother Yang?” Chen Xueshu took them, puzzled.

“Keep them for everyone, just in case. Also, if you encounter Wu Chengyi, don’t trust him at all,” Yang Kai warned seriously.

“What happened?” Upon hearing Wu Chengyi’s name, everyone gathered around.

Yang Kai briefly recounted the events that had transpired.

After listening, everyone’s expressions turned grim.

Zuo Fang cursed, “I knew it! I wondered why Qi Jianxing suddenly disappeared; it turns out he was sent by Wu Chengyi to ambush Brother Yang. When I asked him last time, he said he was just scouting and would return in a few days.”

Chen Xueshu was even angrier, “This person is truly scheming. Such a vicious method, just for a bottle of Healing Pill, he would go to such lengths!”

Han Xiao Qi frowned, “So we misjudged him. If we had continued to follow him, who knows what misfortune we might have encountered.”

For a bottle of Healing Pill, Wu Chengyi could resort to such treachery against Yang Kai. Who knows what he would do for the Blood Bead, targeting these Great Han martial artists around him? With so many people and Blood Beads, and all of them being True Yuan Realm experts, it would be enough for Wu Chengyi to advance a level.

“Next time we encounter him, I’ll help you teach him a lesson!” Ye Qingsi said, her brows furrowing. She came from overseas and had no qualms about the Jiu Xing Sword Sect.

Now that this group was united, the Demonic Beast army of Tianlang Kingdom no longer existed. Besides Wu Chengyi, they only had to be wary of Chi Xue and that Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast. However, even with a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast as a slave, it was still somewhat unrealistic for Chi Xue to deal with so many people alone.

In short, as long as this group stayed together, they were an invincible force.

Chen Xueshu, however, noticed something in Yang Kai’s demeanor: “Brother Yang, you…”

Yang Kai smiled slightly and clasped his fists, “I must leave.”

The group’s expressions changed slightly. Ye Han asked, “You’re leaving? Why do you want to leave?”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Ye Qingsi’s eyes twinkled as she stepped forward, “Is it because you were just beaten, and you’re feeling unwell? If that’s the case, I can let you hit me back, just go a little easier.”

“That’s not it; I just have my own considerations,” Yang Kai didn’t elaborate further.

Upon hearing this, Zi Mo looked at him in surprise, her heart stirred. The others also guessed something, glancing between Zi Mo and Yang Kai, wanting to say something but hesitating.

“Let it be,” Yang Kai smiled, turning to Leng Shan, “You stay and join them.”

As he spoke, he silently called out to the Earth Demon.

However, there was no response. Yang Kai knew that this old demon must have sealed himself. After breaking the seal and communicating with it, he looked at Leng Shan seriously and said, “I have enmity with your Ghost King Valley. Jin Hao was killed by me, and Yu Chengkun was also killed by me. If you wish to avenge them one day, just come to Lingxiao Pavilion to find me.”

If it were a few days ago, Yang Kai would never have spared Leng Shan’s life, but after going through trials together, killing her would be somewhat inhumane.

Leng Shan blinked, shaking her head, “No need.”

Yang Kai smiled slightly, “That’s even better.”

As he spoke, he glanced at her forehead and pondered, “I can’t take back the gift I gave you for now. We’ll talk about it when I reach the Divine Roaming Realm.”

Leng Shan nodded slightly, forcing a smile, “I believe it won’t be long!”

She naturally understood what Yang Kai meant by gift; it was nothing more than the seal in her mind. Without breaking the seal, she would forever be Yang Kai’s servant, unable to control her own life or death.

In this regard, Yang Kai had not deceived her. That seal was planted by the Earth Demon, and both Zi Mo and Leng Shan had sent their Divine Sense to Yang Kai to complete it. If it weren’t for that, it would have been impossible to plant the seal.

But wanting to remove it was not so simple; it required Yang Kai to personally use his methods to lift it.

“Everyone, the green mountains remain, and the waters flow long. Let’s part ways here, and we shall meet again,” Yang Kai smiled and clasped his fists.

“Take care!”

Yang Kai turned and left like a shooting star, while Zi Mo silently followed.

After a long while, Chen Xueshu said, “Actually, having that Tianlang woman follow us isn’t a problem. Brother Yang is overthinking it.”

Ye Qingsi smiled charmingly, “Can you guarantee that you can treat that Tianlang woman with a normal heart?”

Chen Xueshu was taken aback, shaking his head with a bitter smile.

Zi Mo had once been their enemy and was a martial artist from Tianlang, possessing the Control Soul Insect, a treasure that defied the heavens. No one could treat her with a normal heart.

If she stayed, the others would certainly not make things difficult for her out of respect for Yang Kai, but they would definitely be on guard against her, and as an outsider, she wouldn’t feel comfortable either.

Yang Kai must have considered this layer before deciding to take her away.

“Leng Shan, is that woman really Brother Yang’s maid?” Chen Xueshu asked curiously, digging deeper.

Leng Shan glanced at him, her expression cold, then turned away, giving him her back.

“What did I say wrong?” Chen Xueshu was speechless. In that moment, he saw the disgust in Leng Shan’s eyes, unaware that his question had struck a nerve.
