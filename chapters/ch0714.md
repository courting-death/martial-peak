## Chapter 714 — Entering

Zhai Yao also adopted the courtesy-before-force approach, his expression composed.

Hearing him speak, the other side's faces changed. They glanced at Cang Yan and the others and realized the situation had turned bad. Although their numbers matched Cang Yan's group and their cultivations were not weak, they were nonetheless two separate teams and difficult to coordinate; Cang Yan's group, however, were plainly comrades. If a fight broke out, Cang Yan and the others would suffer, but those two teams would likely be doomed.

The experts from the two teams exchanged glances, a brief, tacit communication, and surprisingly reached a unified decision very quickly.

One of the teams shifted closer to the other, giving up their original positions.

Zhai Yao's eyes brightened, looking somewhat surprised; he had only spoken casually and had not expected matters to resolve so smoothly. He hastily said, "Thanks!"

While he spoke, Cang Yan and the others had already descended.

Stepping onto those petals, Yang Kai felt a solid, substantial sensation beneath his feet.

Although the Thousand-Year Demon Flower was composed purely of energy and not a physical object, its energy had condensed until it felt virtually substantial.

"We've yielded the positions to you; how do you refine the medicinal liquid?" one of the opposing experts asked cautiously as he sized up Cang Yan and the others, directing the question to Zhai Yao.

"Wait a little longer." Zhai Yao smiled faintly and did not answer.

The experts from the two teams suddenly wore dark expressions; they condensed their True Yuan and tightened their guard, ready to act at a moment's notice.

In less than ten breaths' time, a visible ring of energy ripples radiated from the very center of the pistil. As the ripples spread, everyone grew alert.

Zhai Yao suddenly edged close to Yang Kai and murmured something. Yang Kai said nothing and nodded slightly.

Immediately afterward, Zhai Yao shouted out an order to Cang Yan and the others.

That small maneuver did not escape the watchful eyes of the other teams' experts; someone angrily demanded, "What trick are you playing? If you dare deceive us, you'll regret it!"

Zhai Yao chuckled, "Relax, you'll soon know how to refine the medicinal liquid. I won't deceive you."

"You'd better not!"

As they spoke, the ripples from the pistil grew ever more frequent and dense, like a still lake repeatedly struck by pebble after pebble.

From the pistil, those concentric ripples spread outward, and a mysterious, wondrous energy conveyed itself from there.

"Go!" Zhai Yao suddenly barked. Yang Kai responded and dashed forward with him toward the pistil.

The two men pushed their speed to the extreme and in an instant reached the very center of the ripples.

A jaw-dropping sight unfolded: as if falling into deep water, their bodies suddenly vanished as they crossed into the center of the ripples.

The experts from the two teams, though constantly vigilant, had not expected such a strange occurrence; by the time they tried to stop it, it was already too late.

They flew into a rage and were about to strike at Cang Yan and the others, when Cang Yan said, "Hold."

"You thieves, have any last words?"

"I can let your alchemists enter; refining the medicinal liquid can only be done inside. But you must stand with us and guard this entrance. You don't want too many rivals breaking in, do you?" Cang Yan said calmly, his Saint-Grade greatsword blazing fiercely in his hands, its presence thoroughly intimidating.

Those people were momentarily stunned, then without hesitation nodded quickly, "Fine!"

"Go ahead." Cang Yan gestured.

The Spirit-Grade alchemists from the two teams hurriedly imitated Zhai Yao and Yang Kai's action, charging into the pistil; in the next moment, their figures vanished.

Four Spirit-Grade alchemists disappeared at the pistil at once, naturally drawing much attention.

Although no one understood why this had occurred, everyone keenly grasped the crucial point: this must be the correct method to condense the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's medicinal liquid.

A chorus of hostile glares turned this way; in the next moment, countless teams surged over.

Cang Yan grinned ferociously and the Saint-Grade greatsword in his hand suddenly transformed into a roaring fire dragon, surging mightily toward the incoming crowd.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh...

Fei Jian notched his bowstring, and invisible, powerful arrows streaked out like a plague of locusts.

From Li Wan's small frame erupted a dazzling golden light; in an instant that short figure swelled like a giant, standing imposingly before the crowd.

Fei Yu parted her crimson lips and exhaled a soft mist of water that instantly hardened into fang-toothed venomous serpents darting through the crowd. Those bitten turned flushed, dizzy as if drunk, staggering about.

The air was thick with the intoxicating scent of wine.

The four experts from Tianxiao Sect unleashed everything they had at once, making every Transcendent Realm by the pistil fall silent with astonishment.

No one dared be negligent. Whether the Transcendent Realm cultivators from the two teams or the six men sent by the City Lord's office, they all displayed their signature Martial Skills and brandished their powerful Secret Treasures.

For a time, the radiance of Martial Skills and Secret Treasures bloomed, and on the petals of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower a titanic battle unfolded.

Although Cang Yan and his allies numbered many — with the two teams their count reached seventeen or eighteen and their strength was not slight — a tiger still struggles against a pack. Facing hundreds of Transcendent Realm experts pressing forward, they were soon overwhelmed.

In barely twenty breaths, everyone had sustained varying degrees of injuries. Li Wan, who pressed the front, had been battered by countless attacks until he was bloodied and pitiable.

Cang Yan's expression was extremely grave. While defending the pistil with the others, he watched the motions of the pistil intently.

Since the four Spirit-Grade alchemists had breached its interior, the ripples from the pistil had seemed to spread much more slowly, and as time passed this slowdown continued.

After a while longer, no more ripples spread forth.

"Go!" Cang Yan roared, unwilling to linger. He grabbed Li Wan and streaked away like lightning.

Fei Yu and the others and the six sent by the City Lord's office followed closely.

The remaining two teams seemed still stunned, not understanding why they had given up so easily. Without Cang Yan and the others, there was no way they could hold, and seeing the furious opponents bearing down, they fled in haste.

At the pistil, the passageway stood wide open, empty.

The attackers rejoiced and leapt up en masse, fighting as they escorted their alchemists, intent on imitating Yang Kai, Zhai Yao, and the others by storming into the pistil.

To their astonishment, because the ripples no longer spread, no matter how hard they tried, no one could enter the pistil again.

For a time, countless people cursed angrily.

Cang Yan and his group had already returned to the foot of the peak, each panting and bloodied. Even a woman like Fei Yu had her hair disheveled, her face pale with lingering fright.

Fortunately, the defenders needed only to hold for about thirty breaths; had the time been longer, none of them would likely have survived.

Everyone was wounded; Li Wan's injuries were the worst. After the golden light and his giant stature faded, he collapsed unconscious.

Elder Li hurried forward and distributed a pill to each of them.

Cang Yan and the others thanked him and took the pills, swallowing to refine them.

In a short while they all felt much better; Li Wan's condition stabilized and he was no longer in danger of death.

"Elder Li, is that all?" Cang Yan opened his eyes and turned to look at the Thousand-Year Demon Flower still blossoming in empty space. Even now, countless experts remained on its petals, searching for an entry.

"Mm, that's enough." Elder Li nodded slightly. "The rest depends on their own fortune."

"Two alchemists went in because we reluctantly let them," Cang Yan said with some displeasure.

"It's fine; even if they entered, they won't gain much." Elder Li chuckled, clearly confident in Zhai Yao.

"Indeed." Cang Yan nodded slightly. "With Yang Kai in there, those two outsiders probably won't make any waves. That kid has even killed two Transcendent Realm Second Stage experts."

"We owe Elder Li a great debt this time." Fei Yu spoke with lingering fear. "If not for Elder Li's guidance, we would have been like those others, rushing about like headless flies."

Who would have thought there were so many intricacies to condensing the Thousand-Year Demon Flower's medicinal liquid? Everyone had assumed that once the flower bloomed, having an alchemist refine it would suffice. Had fate not smiled upon them — Yang Kai meeting Zhai Yao, and then receiving Elder Li's instruction — they certainly would not have been so fortunate.

"I've simply lived a few more years than you." Elder Li smiled kindly. "Hmm, there's no need to wait here any longer; let's return to Fuyun City. They probably won't emerge for some days yet."

Everyone nodded and followed Elder Li back toward Fuyun City.

Along the way, Cang Yan noticed Elder Li seemed quite interested in the young junior nephew and asked many questions about him. Although others were present, Cang Yan answered Elder Li's inquiries as fully as he could.

"Oh, so he comes from a very remote place?" Elder Li smiled faintly. "I see."

"We never expected a boy from such a place to possess such astonishing talent," Cang Yan said wryly. Put beside Yang Kai's performance, the Tianxiao Sect's elite disciples appeared worthless.

"One mustn't underestimate those from humble origins. Such places can harbor outstanding talent; it's just that various constraints suppress their development. If they can break through those harsh conditions, they often shine far brighter than ordinary people." Elder Li said in a low voice.

"Elder Li is absolutely right." Cang Yan laughed softly. "I didn't believe it before, but after meeting the junior nephew I do. The kid also told me he has two senior sisters, who are said to be not inferior to him and may even be stronger."

"Two senior sisters?" Elder Li raised his brows.

"Yes, the junior nephew has been searching for them but found no leads. Ah, in this vast sea of people, finding two individuals is truly difficult."
