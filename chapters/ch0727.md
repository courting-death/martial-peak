## Chapter 727 — Meng Wuya's Message

Shui Ling's status was exalted, so Liu Zhuo's concerns were perfectly understandable. Yang Kai had no desire to comment; this was another's territory, and if he meddled with too many words he would only make himself disliked.

Shui Ling stuck out her delicate tongue at Yang Kai, then looked at Liu Zhuo and said, "You go. Better to settle that fellow quickly."

"But, Miss..." Liu Zhuo frowned, clearly unwilling; his duty was to protect Shui Ling, everything else came second.

"If I tell you to go, then go — what are you nagging about? I'm in a hurry to chat with this bastard." Shui Ling glared at him, then softened her tone to reassure, "Don't worry, I'll hide well over here. Besides, with this bastard here, even if a Demonic Beast charges over, it probably can't do anything to me, right?"

That last question, however, was directed at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave a light chuckle and did not answer directly.

A Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast, though huge and formidable, was still something he was confident he could kill; but stealing the limelight was best avoided. Yang Kai did not want to earn anyone's enmity.

"Go on, what are you still standing here for?" Shui Ling urged when she saw Liu Zhuo had not moved.

Only then did Liu Zhuo cast a cold, distant look at Yang Kai and hiss, "Kid, keep a close eye on the Miss. Don't let anything happen to her."

"Don't worry," Yang Kai nodded.

Liu Zhuo then deployed his movement technique and streaked toward the sea surface.

With his arrival the battle changed dramatically. Two Transcendent Realm experts fought together, and the Divine Roaming Realm practitioners on the side coordinated; they quickly seized the initiative, driving the sea beast to mournful cries — all eight of its fleshy legs suffered injury.

Yang Kai stood watching for a while, and after confirming there were no further problems, he smiled faintly, "These people seem very loyal to you."

"They're all mine. Of course they're loyal." Shui Ling's face brimmed with pride. "Do you think I'm as powerless and alone as I was back in Zhongdu? I'm warning you — if you bully me again, I'll have them rip you to pieces."

"I haven't bullied you, have I?" Yang Kai said in surprise.

Shui Ling snorted, "Whether you have or not, you know in your own heart! Years apart, and you've grown a lot. What level are you at now?"

Yang Kai sniffed, "Why are you asking about that?"

He did not mean to hide it from Shui Ling, only feared telling her would be a blow. The first time they met, Shui Ling had been an Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert, while Yang Kai had only been at the peak of the True Yuan Realm; after these few years his cultivation had completely surpassed hers. He had advanced far, far too quickly.

Yang Kai kept silent, but Shui Ling had noticed. Guan'er laughed, "Even if you don't say it I can guess — such a pace of cultivation suits you. It proves I wasn't wrong about you. Wherever you go you manage to thrive; it's truly enviable. I, on the other hand, without the Water Divine Hall, am good for nothing."

"Why does a girl need such high cultivation anyway?"

"I won't argue that. Tell me — now that you've seen the wealth of my Water Divine Hall, have you thought about joining? I'll say it again: if you join, I can provide the best environment for your cultivation. Also, I have many islands under my command; if any catch your eye, pick one — from now on it will be yours."

Three years ago Shui Ling had tried to win Yang Kai over; upon meeting him now, the thought still crossed her mind.

No one else had ever made Shui Ling's eyes light up the way he did. Only Yang Kai had achieved that. Though he could be hateful at times, his skills and talent were undeniable.

"If I join I'll be ruined." Yang Kai smiled and gently refused her kindness. "The Water Divine Hall's water energies are so dense — how could I cultivate here?"

"Of course the Water Divine Hall has places suited for you. There are several volcanic islands — very hot climates."

"Still no, I already have somewhere to settle."

"Where is that?" Shui Ling brightened with interest. "It actually meets your approval?"

Yang Kai briefly recounted what had happened at Tianxiao Sect; upon hearing that the founder there was the same one who established Lingxiao Pavilion, Shui Ling felt much relieved.

Lingxiao Pavilion was Yang Kai's old sect; that he chose Tianxiao Sect was therefore understandable. Tianxiao Sect was also a major power on the Tongxuan Continent, a name even Shui Ling had heard from time to time.

While they spoke, the battle had already ended over there.

After Liu Zhuo joined in, the sea beast could not match them and fled badly wounded. It was a pity they had not slain it, but the fact their side suffered no losses was good news.

Shui Ling gave an order to let them handle matters there and led Yang Kai as they flew off in a direction.

Shui Ling's island, among the thousands of isles in this sea, was relatively large and rich in Spiritual Qi. It belonged to Shui Ling and even bore her name.

She lived and cultivated on this island most of the time.

The island's residents were mostly disciples of the Water Divine Hall and their families. Dwellings were arranged neatly, people came and went, and the place was lively.

At the island's highest point sat a row of palace-like buildings — Shui Ling's residence.

When they arrived, a young and pretty maidservant attended them with eager politeness, offering fine wines, delicacies, and rare sea delicacies, warmly entertaining Yang Kai.

But with worries in his heart, the food and drink had little taste for Yang Kai.

Shui Ling seemed to notice and dismissed the attendants. She then said, "I know why you came, and I can tell you I do have the information you want."

Yang Kai's breath quickened a little; his gaze burned as he fixed on her, "So Meng Wuya did come here and left a message for you."

"Mm. Two years ago he suddenly arrived at the Water Divine Hall with that little senior sister of yours who knows alchemy. After leaving some words they hurried off, asking me to pass a message to you if I ever saw you. I had planned to search for you at the Duao Alliance, but when I got there Yun Xuan said you were likely dead." Shui Ling sighed softly. "Luckily you're safe. Fortune favors the upright."

"What did Shopkeeper Meng ask you to convey to me?" Yang Kai asked urgently.

"He said that after that old fellow Di Mo arrived he split up from them and seemed to declare he wanted to go to the Demon Domain to build up strength, waiting for the Young Master's arrival." Shui Ling pursed her lips and smiled.

"That old fellow..." Yang Kai shook his head and smiled bitterly. But Di Mo's ambitions could very well come to pass — he was not ordinary. He possessed the body of a demon general, which was his greatest asset; if used well, within the demon ranks he would certainly fare smoothly.

"What about Su Yan? Where is Su Yan?"

Shui Ling glanced at him before speaking: “Must I tell you exactly where she is? I can tell you she is safe. Senior Meng and your Little Senior Sister seemed to have important matters to attend to, so Senior Meng entrusted Su Yan to the power of an old friend. She is temporarily cultivating there, and the location of that force is extremely suitable for her. Not only is she in no danger, but she will also gain immeasurably from it.”

“Then why don’t you tell me exactly where she is?” Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

“Because if I told you, you would certainly go after her. That force is not a place where just anyone can set foot. Its people are rather unapproachable, and their might far surpasses my Water Divine Hall. They have countless masters. With your temper, if you went there and could not see Su Yan, who knows what trouble you might stir up? By then, you might not even be able to return.”

“It can’t be that bad, right? I just want to see my Senior Sister—why would they make things difficult for me?”

“I already said, those people are unapproachable. You cannot judge them by common sense.”

Yang Kai frowned slightly, pondering, and murmured softly: “So Shopkeeper Meng entrusted Su Yan to that force before coming to the Water Divine Hall to leave word with you. That means that force is most likely near the Water Divine Hall. And since my Senior Sister Su Yan cultivates the Ice Heart Technique, only a place of extreme cold would suit her… A sect located in the frigid lands near your Water Divine Hall, and one whose power surpasses the Water Divine Hall…”

“Enough already!” Shui Ling was left speechless. In just a few words, Yang Kai had nearly deduced Su Yan’s location. Realizing that concealing it further was useless, she glared at him resentfully. “You’re too clever!”

“Then just tell me directly. Better than me racking my brains with no leads, still having to ask around!” Yang Kai chuckled. He was not very familiar with the powers of this world; otherwise, he would have guessed it earlier.

“The Ice Sect!” Shui Ling said helplessly. “Ever heard of it?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

"Several thousand li to the west of my Water Divine Hall is a land formed by glaciers — the Ice Sect resides in that glacier world. They rarely interact with outsiders, living almost in complete isolation, which is why I said they are unapproachable. The nearest place to them is my Water Divine Hall, so I know a little about them. Occasionally we do business, but each of them, young or old, man or woman, is as cold as ice. Your little ice-doll of a senior sister going there was truly appropriate."

“Why would Shopkeeper Meng bring my Senior Sister to such a place?” Yang Kai frowned.

“It seems Senior Meng has some friendship with the master of the Ice Sect. That is why he felt at ease entrusting Su Yan there,” Shui Ling explained. Then she looked at Yang Kai and asked, “You’re planning to go to the Ice Sect, aren’t you?”

Yang Kai nodded.

He had been searching here for several years, and now that he finally had definite news, he naturally had to go and see how Su Yan was doing. If the Ice Sect truly was well-suited for her, then letting her remain there to cultivate was fine. But if she wished to leave with him, Yang Kai would take her away to the Tianxiao Sect.

Chu Lingxiao was the founder of Lingxiao Pavilion—naturally, also Su Yan’s ancestral master.

“When will you leave?”

“Right now, of course.”

“Do you even know where it is?” Shui Ling rolled her eyes at him. “Wait a few days. I’ll find some people familiar with the route to lead you there. That way, you won’t waste time wandering aimlessly.”

“That’s fine.” Yang Kai nodded, not refusing Shui Ling’s kindness. Having a guide was certainly much better than searching blindly on his own.
