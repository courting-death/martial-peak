## Chapter 254 â€” Chi Xue

Walking through the dense forest, Zi Mo gazed complexly at Yang Kai's back.

Several times she wanted to speak but hesitated, unsure of what to say.

A silent tranquility enveloped the two, with Yang Kai sprinting ahead, occasionally stopping to frown in contemplation, glancing around, before suddenly setting off again.

Zi Mo followed closely behind him like a shadow, never leaving his side.

After a day, Zi Mo could no longer endure the silence. In a fit of pique, she halted in her tracks.

Yang Kai had already flown several hundred zhang when he sensed something was off, quickly turning back. He saw Zi Mo still standing in place, her chin slightly raised, coldly staring at him.

"What are you doing?" Yang Kai frowned, his expression quite displeased.

"I should be asking you the same thing." Zi Mo's chest heaved as she threw out a blunt remark, her tone softening considerably, "You really don't need to do this."

"Do what?" Yang Kai looked at her in confusion.

"Separate from those people. Being with them, you have no need to worry about your safety. In this foreign land, aside from you, me, and that group, there are only my Senior Brother and Wu Chengyi left. With their strength and numbers, there's no need to fear my Senior Brother and Wu Chengyi, so it's unwise for you to separate from them!"

Yang Kai sized her up, a mysterious smile slowly blooming at the corners of his mouth.

"You can't possibly think that I separated from that group because I was concerned about your situation?" Yang Kai frowned.

Zi Mo's face flushed slightly as she stared at Yang Kai, retorting, "Isn't that so?"

"You think too highly of yourself." Yang Kai scoffed with disdain, "You are a martial artist of Tianlang. Until yesterday, we were still enemies who shared no bond of life or death. No matter how well you perform, you still want my life in your heart. You are unkind, and I am ungrateful. Why should I care about your life or death?"

Zi Mo was furious, her chest rising and falling as she gritted her teeth, "Since you took control of me, what have I done wrong? I know you care about your pride and are stubborn, but you don't have to be so heartless!"

When he killed Bi Xiuming, it was the same. Although he was furious at Bi Xiuming's previous disdain and mockery, part of the reason was to stand up for herself. But this man stubbornly refused to admit it. Zi Mo was clever; whatever he said was what it was, and she wouldn't expose him, allowing him to save face.

But now, he actually spoke like this. Was face really that important?

"Is there any affection between us?" Yang Kai chuckled, stepping forward and wrapping an arm around Zi Mo's waist, his hand unceremoniously rubbing against her smooth skin.

Zi Mo quickly raised both hands to block Yang Kai's chest, her upper body bending backward. A wave of tingling sensation coursed through her waist, making her feel a chill in her heart. She frowned and coldly scolded, "What are you doing?"

"You say I'm heartless, so let me show you my feelings." Yang Kai's hand grew even bolder.

"Let go of me!" Zi Mo's expression turned icy.

Yang Kai grinned, no longer being reckless, and casually released her.

Zi Mo quickly stepped back a few paces, creating distance between them, her face filled with vigilance and wariness.

"You are right." Yang Kai suddenly nodded, "Separating from them indeed has part of the reason of being concerned about your situation..."

A flicker of small emotion flashed in Zi Mo's eyes amidst her anger.

"After all, you are under my control, considered my servant. If you lose face, I lose face too, right?"

Zi Mo's pretty face suddenly turned cold again.

That damned man! Zi Mo cursed inwardly, filled with resentment.

"However... that's not the main reason!" Yang Kai raised a finger and shook it.

"What is the main reason?" Zi Mo took a deep breath and asked.

"I want to find Wu Chengyi!" Yang Kai's face flashed with a hint of ruthlessness. "I want to kill him!"

Wu Chengyi had sent his junior brother to take Yang Kai's life, and Yang Kai was not someone to be trifled with. There is a head to every grievance and a master to every debt; Wu Chengyi must pay for his actions.

As an elite disciple of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect, his status was certainly not low. If he escaped this foreign land, it would be difficult to kill him outside. Therefore, Yang Kai wanted to resolve this here.

Opportunities must not be missed.

Moreover, he must have treasures like Liuyan Liquid on him, and Yang Kai could not let him go.

Although Liuyan Liquid was of no use to him, it was useful to others. However, if he acted together with that group, even if he killed Wu Chengyi, there wouldn't be enough Liuyan Liquid to share.

Yang Kai wanted it all for himself!

"You really have guts. Someone who can escape from my Senior Brother's hands must be exceptional. I won't deny that you are strong, but do you think you can defeat Wu Chengyi?" Zi Mo looked at Yang Kai as if he were a monster, her expression one of disbelief, secretly thinking this person was truly reckless.

"Whether I can win or not, I'll know after I fight." Yang Kai snorted lightly, looking at Zi Mo with deep meaning, "Aren't you going to assist me? What do you think I brought you out for?"

Zi Mo's pretty face turned cold, and she stomped her foot, "You can go die!"

So he had so many plans! How foolish of her to feel a little moved just now.

"Haha!" Yang Kai laughed heartily, reaching out to touch Zi Mo's small face, teasing, "Don't be so heartless. Spend more time with me, and you'll discover I have many merits. Perhaps you'll end up infatuated with me."

"Shameless!" Zi Mo was furious yet laughed.

Although his words were somewhat shameless, it was undeniable that he had many shining points that other young men lacked. These points, which inadvertently revealed themselves, were very attractive, especially to women!

Knowing his true thoughts, Zi Mo no longer felt angry. Instead, she smiled slightly and asked, "So you have been observing everywhere to find Wu Chengyi's whereabouts. Have you found any clues?"

"None." Yang Kai shook his head, "It's very easy for a master like him to conceal his whereabouts."

After a pause, Yang Kai smiled confidently, "But as long as he is still here, I will find him."

"I think I can help you!" Zi Mo chuckled lightly.

Yang Kai nodded, "That's exactly what I meant!"

In the following days, Yang Kai and Zi Mo searched for Wu Chengyi's traces while also hunting Demonic Beasts.

Yao He and Yao Xi had controlled over a hundred Demonic Beasts that day. Although they had killed thirty or forty, nearly seventy remained. These were probably the only Demonic Beasts left in this foreign land.

After several days, their harvest was minimal. Zi Mo had only controlled seven Demonic Beasts with her Control Soul Insect. These controlled Demonic Beasts scattered, greatly increasing the search range and efficiency.

After more than ten days, the number of Demonic Beasts controlled by Zi Mo increased to fifteen. One day, Yang Kai finally discovered Wu Chengyi's trace.

One of the Demonic Beasts searching outside suddenly died. When Yang Kai and Zi Mo went to check, they found traces of sword energy left behind.

"It's Wu Chengyi!" Yang Kai's expression brightened. This sword energy could not be unleashed by just anyone; only disciples of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect could do so.

Moreover, the one that died was a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast. To kill it in one strike, the person wielding the sword energy must possess considerable strength.

Piecing together various clues, Yang Kai almost instantly deduced that it was Wu Chengyi's doing.

Following the trail, they pursued for half a day but lost Wu Chengyi's trace again.

Yang Kai frowned tightly, feeling for the first time how frustrating it was not to have cultivated Divine Sense. Finding a person was so troublesome. If he had cultivated Divine Sense, it would be different. As long as his Divine Sense was strong enough, he could easily perceive everything within several dozen li.

Just as Yang Kai was feeling vexed, Zi Mo suddenly changed her expression and looked at Yang Kai, saying, "My Senior Brother is nearby!"

Yang Kai turned to her, "Chi Xue?"

"Yes." Zi Mo's expression was not good. "He has a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast. Combined with his own strength, he is unmatched here. If you encounter him, you will undoubtedly die. We should avoid him!"

"He is here... Could it be that he is chasing after Wu Chengyi?" Yang Kai's thoughts raced. Back then, the four from Tianlang's Senluo Palace had surrounded the martial artists of the Great Han with a horde of Demonic Beasts. Except for Wu Chengyi, who escaped by his own strength, the others were all captured. Later, Chi Xue led the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts he controlled to pursue. He must have been chasing Wu Chengyi all this time.

And Yang Kai was doing the same thing. It was not surprising that the two would cross paths.

"We don't have time!" Zi Mo's face turned pale as she turned to look aside, then softly instructed, "Don't speak when we meet. I will deal with him. If he finds out about our relationship, he will definitely not let you go."

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

Zi Mo snorted coldly, "I'm doing this for self-preservation. Don't overthink it. If you want to put me in danger, it's just a thought. So I can't let you be in any danger, lest you act out of desperation and drag me down with you."

"Hehe." Yang Kai chuckled, following her gaze.

He saw a majestic and fierce Demonic Beast suddenly leap out from the forest. This Demonic Beast resembled both a wolf and a tiger, its form agile, its limbs strong and powerful, exuding a fierce aura. It was over three zhang long, and even from several dozen zhang away, it brought an inexplicable sense of pressure to Yang Kai!

A Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast! A true Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast!

When it emerged, the Demonic Beasts around Zi Mo all crouched down, behaving as obediently as mice before a cat.

On the back of the Demonic Beast sat a young man dressed in a purple robe, around twenty-five or twenty-six years old, with eyebrows like swords, slanting into his temples, and bright, piercing eyes that radiated coldness.

This was Chi Xue! He had a completely different aura from Wu Chengyi. Compared to Wu Chengyi, who was more composed, Chi Xue appeared more domineering. But regardless of who it was, they both exuded an air of arrogance.

Both were favored children of heaven, possessing the capital to be arrogant!

He looked at Zi Mo, allowing his Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast to stride forward, not even glancing at Yang Kai.

The Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast stopped several dozen zhang away.

"Senior Brother!" Zi Mo stepped forward to pay her respects. The Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast let out a low growl, filled with a sense of threat.

The Demonic Beast's reaction made Zi Mo's heart skip a beat. Looking at her Senior Brother, she found him staring at her with a cold, icy gaze.
