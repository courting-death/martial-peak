## Chapter 1792 — Scramble

Xu Wei's surprise attack had caught Xue Yue off guard for a moment, but her reaction was unbelievably swift; the instant she sensed something amiss she activated her own Shi to relieve some of the pressure, and the light about her flared wildly as she brought forth a secret treasure shaped like a jade ruyi, which transformed into a luminous curtain that enveloped her whole body.

With the light curtain shielding her, the pressure generated by the Domain Field was greatly reduced in an instant.

That jade ruyi was clearly a potent secret treasure capable of countering the Domain Field might of the Void King Realm, much like the Bright Sea Dividing Domain Mirror worn by the Sword Alliance's Young Master, Gu Jianxin.

Such secret treasures were impossible for ordinary people to possess; they were extremely difficult to refine and required outrageously costly materials that ordinary martial artists could not afford.

But figures like her and Gu Jianxin inevitably carried one or two on their person, prepared for emergencies.

After all, they were only at the Origin Returning Realm, and for an Origin Returning Realm cultivator to contend with a Void King Realm opponent the greatest difficulty was overcoming the Domain Field's suppression of their Shi field; once that difficulty was removed, an Origin Returning Realm cultivator still had a chance to survive under a Void King Realm's hand.

For them, such a secret treasure was literally a lifesaving treasure.

Once the jade ruyi appeared, Xue Yue felt the pressure ease; she straightened from her crouch, twisted her head, and cast a cold glance over her shoulder to see exactly who had attacked her.

"Xu Wei!" Xue Yue barked, surprise flashing across her face—she could not understand what on earth had possessed Xu Wei to launch an attack on her at this moment.

After all, such an action brought him no benefit and would instead offend the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

Had Xu Wei had his head clamped in a door?

"Third Young Master, my apologies!" Xu Wei, though unwilling in his heart, could not help but bow to Zi Donglai's coercive power and pressed on with the assault on Xue Yue; since the Domain Field could not completely suppress her, he slapped out, summoning a dagger-like secret treasure and pouring Saint Yuan into it. The dagger shivered in an instant.

"Go!" Xu Wei flung it, and the dagger became a streak of light, flying like an arrow from a loosened bowstring toward Xue Yue.

Xue Yue's face changed; she dared not confront an attack from a Void King Realm head-on and swiftly twisted her body to dodge. At the same time, she invoked the bracelet treasure again; one bracelet became two, two became four, four became eight...

In moments, the sky filled with illusory images of bracelets, making it impossible to tell which were real and which were false.

The countless bracelets swirled at Xue Yue's side, forming an airtight protective net.

Clang, clang—

A series of crisp sounds rang out as the bracelet phantoms struck the dagger's light; one after another the phantoms were dispelled, and the dagger's force was gradually blunted.

"Xu Wei, you're courting death!" Ni Guang, who had noticed the commotion, roared with indignation.

Xu Wei gritted his teeth and kept silent, bitter feelings choking him like having eaten gall.

He knew that after this incident he had truly invited great trouble upon himself.

"Brother Ni, my earlier proposal still stands; you might consider it more carefully," Zi Long's voice sounded, unhurried and as if fully confident of success.

Others did not know why Xu Wei had so recklessly attacked Xue Yue, but Zi Long was fully aware—it was his son's idea, and at this moment only his son could drive Xu Wei to act.

Zi Long was very pleased with Zi Donglai's decision.

Ni Guang's face darkened like still water; while he controlled his humanoid puppet to contend with Zi Long for the Everlasting Tree, he also kept an eye on Xue Yue's situation and soon snarled, "If I can't have it, neither will you!"

"What do you intend?" Zi Long's expression changed.

Ni Guang answered with action. At the instant his words fell, the humanoid puppet on which he relied suddenly burst with dazzling light, its limbs flaring wide as it ferociously attacked the giant python puppet.

A series of thuds sounded; the giant python puppet was struck until sparks flew.

"Ni Guang!" Zi Long howled, his face twisted; his puppet, already under great pressure within the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, had taken heavy damage and now, blasted by Ni Guang's humanoid puppet, suffered even more, its limbs failing to function smoothly.

"Hahaha!" Ni Guang laughed heartily; seizing the moment when the giant python puppet was driven back, he had his humanoid puppet snatch a leaf bearing Undying Nectar from the tree and ripped it off with a vicious tug.

In the next moment, the humanoid puppet bolted outward without looking back.

Yet as it fled, the puppet made sounds like a breaking bellows and pieces of its components began falling away.

That puppet had clearly reached its limit!

Its speed slowed, and it seemed on the verge of collapse at any moment.

At the same time, Zi Long's giant python puppet was in no better shape; after Ni Guang's fierce assault its limbs moved sluggishly, actions were clumsy, and its components began to fracture.

Seeing this, Zi Long knew the situation could not continue; he had to settle for second best, commanding the giant python puppet to bite off a leaf bearing Undying Nectar and then return.

The two puppets came back one after the other, each bringing a leaf of the Everlasting Tree and each carrying a drop of Undying Nectar.

Ni Guang and Zi Long rushed forward cautiously, neither daring to let down their guard.

If the Ghost Ancestor suddenly struck to seize the treasures at this moment, then all their efforts would have been in vain and handed to someone else.

Meanwhile, Xue Yue's situation grew more precarious; Ni Guang was unwilling to forego the Undying Nectar and the Everlasting Tree leaf he had nearly secured, so he temporarily left Xue Yue to fend for herself.

He trusted that Xue Yue's foundation would prevent her from being so easily killed by Xu Wei.

Xue Yue did not disappoint him—powerful secret treasures and a variety of techniques emerged one after another, and her companion yao spirit Xiezhi was even summoned into play; still, the gap between Xue Yue and Xu Wei, after all, was a full realm, so her predicament remained grave.

"You little whelp, daring to bully the weak—how disgraceful!" The Ghost Ancestor, who had stood silently nearby, suddenly sneered and reached out a hand toward Xu Wei.

As that hand stretched forth, a sky-covering black hand formed above Xu Wei's head from dark qi, entwined with countless Yin-souls that swirled and shrieked with a horrifying, otherworldly wail.

The Ghost Ancestor's sudden move made Xu Wei's soul chill; he uttered a strangled cry and no longer dared attack Xue Yue—he hurriedly invoked his protective secret treasure, circulating Saint Yuan as he delivered a desperate strike skyward.

A thunderous boom echoed as the black giant hand shuddered slightly from the blow but still came down, directly enveloping Xu Wei.

The ground trembled; Xu Wei groaned. When the black hand dispersed he stood pale and blood leaked from the corner of his mouth.

Clearly, he had been injured by that strike.

The gap between the Second Stage of the Void King Realm and the First Stage was plain to see!

After the blow, the Ghost Ancestor did not finish Xu Wei off—though far stronger than Xu Wei, killing a Void King Realm cultivator was not so easy, and there were more important matters awaiting him; he had no time to tangle with Xu Wei.

He had acted entirely because of Yang Kai.

In his view, Xue Yue was Yang Kai's woman, and as a Grand Elder of the Lingxiao Sect he could not stand by and watch her be bullied by a Void King Realm cultivator; to do so before Yang Kai would be shameful.

"If you dare act recklessly again, this old man will kill you!" the Ghost Ancestor glared at Xu Wei with a sinister look and threatened savagely.

Xu Wei broke into a cold sweat.

Xue Yue, panting, glanced at the Ghost Ancestor and gave him a slight nod of thanks; Zi Donglai, however, was extremely displeased by the Ghost Ancestor's interference, confusion and anger flickering across his face.

He could not understand why the Ghost Ancestor would help Xue Yue.

In that brief delay, Ni Guang and Zi Long had already secured the Everlasting Tree leaf and the Undying Nectar respectively; both immediately produced pre-prepared containers and sealed the treasures inside before stuffing them into spatial rings, finally exhaling in relief.

In any case, obtaining a leaf of the Everlasting Tree and a drop of Undying Nectar meant the trip had already yielded great rewards—though the Everlasting Tree itself...

Both men's puppets had been destroyed; they no longer had the means to penetrate the Seven Luminaries Divine Light at will.

"Huh, Yang Kai has arrived!" the Ghost Ancestor suddenly felt something and looked in a direction.

Hearing him say so, Xue Yue’s face lit up with joy. She followed his gaze and indeed saw a streak of light rapidly approaching from the distance — within that light, she could sense an aura that felt deeply familiar to her.

A moment later Yang Kai appeared, and seeing so many people gathered here he was taken aback.

He hurried over but had nonetheless arrived a bit late.

He glanced at Xue Yue and gave a subtle nod, then slipped to the Ghost Ancestor's side and asked softly, "Grand Elder, did I come a bit late?"

"Yes, a little late," the Ghost Ancestor nodded, "but it doesn't matter—the greatest treasures remain here; they couldn't take them, hahahaha."

Yang Kai's gaze immediately fell on the Everlasting Tree; he squinted to examine it closely and a look of shock slowly spread across his face.

He could sense that this seemingly fragile sapling contained unimaginable vitality, and the milky, dew-like substance on one of its leaves was unquestionably a treasure of incalculable value.

"Everlasting Tree, Immortal Source Liquid?" Yang Kai murmured.

"Eh, you recognize these things?" the Ghost Ancestor looked at him in surprise.

Had he not heard Ni Guang and Zi Long's words earlier, the Ghost Ancestor himself would not have known the Everlasting Tree by sight; he did not expect Yang Kai to recognize it at a glance.

"Given such tremendous life force, I could think of nothing else but the Everlasting Tree," Yang Kai said with burning excitement on his face. "There's actually an Everlasting Tree here! No wonder the Divine Bird nested here..."

The Everlasting Tree was a treasure of the world; in terms of value it far surpassed Yang Kai's Warm Spirit Lotus—after all, the Warm Spirit Lotus only nourished and replenished the spirit, while the Everlasting Tree could render a cultivator immortal and indestructible; which was more important was obvious.
