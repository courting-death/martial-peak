## Chapter 1342 — Formation Talisman

Although the Ninth-Tier cloud beast was imposing, neither Yang Kai nor Lian Guang were ordinary Third Stage of the Saint King Realm fighters; Yang Kai need not be mentioned — fighting above one’s rank was his habit — and the puppets Lian Guang commanded were no trivial matter. With the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird cooperating, they easily entangled the Ninth-Tier demonic beast, preventing it from harassing Fei Zhi Tu and the others.

Were it not for concerns over the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation’s strangeness and myriad changes, the two would likely have slain that Ninth-Tier cloud beast in short order.

Seeing two Saint King Realm cultivators handle the matter so easily, Fei Zhi Tu and the others were overjoyed and momentarily eased in heart. After witnessing the cloud beasts’ genesis, they understood that within this formation they could only stall for time, and immediately altered their previous plan — not to kill the beasts, but to hold them back.

With that, the pressure on everyone greatly lessened, and they managed matters with composure.

During this time, Cai He and Du Sisi kept pouring Saint Yuan into the Formation Plates and Foundations, probing the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation’s mysteries, trying to find things like its Eye or Gate. But this array was an ancient wonder; even though both came from families proficient in formations, they were baffled in the short term, foreheads perspiring with anxiety.

Though the situation seemed stable for the moment, both Yang Kai and Lian Guang—both at the Saint King Realm—as well as Fei Zhi Tu and the other three Origin Returning Realm masters, were handling things with apparent ease. Yet if the battle dragged on, changes would be inevitable. Who could say whether more Cloud Beasts might emerge from within this formation?

Thus the two redoubled their efforts, applying everything they knew to continuously simulate the formation’s various shifts.

One incense-burn later…

Half an hour later…

An hour later…

Wen's expression grew increasingly grave, and Fei Zhi Tu and the others were no longer relaxed. Instead, the comparatively weaker Yang Kai and Lian Guang wore serene expressions.

For Yang Kai, the main force in this battle was still the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit; he was merely standing to the side, casually using the Nine Heavens Divine Technique to restrain the Ninth-Tier Cloud Beast. With the amount of Saint Yuan stored within his body, the expenditure was negligible. As for Lian Guang, he was controlling his puppet to face the enemy—though his Divine Sense consumption was immense, after taking a few Pills to replenish his Divine Sense, he remained calm and composed, his expression unchanged.

But after this long tangle, Fei Zhi Tu and the others were beginning to feel strained — their Saint Yuan exhausted. If it continued like this, the situation would be worrying. Fei Zhi Tu could not help growing anxious, frequently glancing toward Cai He and Du Sisi to check their progress.

Wen, seeing this, had to urge Cai He and Du Sisi forward; the two did not disappoint. After an hour of simulation they finally discovered a flaw.

A mysterious profusion of light abruptly shot forth from the countless Formation Plates and Foundations, circled twice in place, then leisurely streamed off into the distance.

In the blink of an eye that beam struck a drifting crimson cloud in midair; once struck, the moving crimson cloud suddenly froze in place.

Du Sisi’s pretty face brightened as she cried, "The Formation Eye is there! Destroy it and the Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation will be broken!"

At her shout, everyone’s faces lit up. Although since entering they had suspected the Formation Eye or gate might hide among the countless clouds, no one dared lightly touch them for fear of unforeseen consequences. Now that the eye had been found, that worry vanished.

"Brother Wen!" Fei Zhi Tu suddenly barked.

"Leave it to me!" Wen’s face hardened with a cold light. Fixing his gaze on the cloud struck by the mysterious beam, he flicked his wrist and a half-foot-long golden needle materialized between his fingers. He poured Saint Yuan into it; golden radiance burst forth as he lowly bellowed, "Go!"

With that he tossed his hand and the golden light shot toward the cloud. In midair the golden glow seemed to take the shape of a fang-toothed spirit snake, mouth wide and fearsome.

Just as the golden light was about to strike the cloud, a startling scene occurred.

The cloud writhed and shifted, suddenly transforming into a small crimson beast like a squirrel. Its eyes spun and it displayed an expression of utter disdain before its form flickered and it eerily vanished from where it had been.

The spirit-snake made of golden light lunged forward and struck only empty air.

Wen’s face darkened. He had expected the cloud to change, but had not imagined the cloud-beast would simply vanish; even using Divine Sense he could not detect any trace.

As he fumed, Yang Kai’s figure flashed like a gale. He shot to the spot where the little beast had disappeared, cool-faced, stretching his hand out to seize it.

A soft ripping sound…

Yang Kai’s large hand seemed to have grabbed something, though no one, not even Wen, could see anything — only a chorus of squeaking noises came from that spot.

Momentarily a flash of flowing light flickered and the previously vanished little beast once again eerily reappeared, and this time it was held in Yang Kai’s palm.

It had not left; rather it had concealed itself by some method that could deceive Wen’s Divine Sense!

How did the brat find it? Wen stared at Yang Kai, stunned and suspicious, unable to tell whether the youth had stumbled into the catch or had acted with intention.

As his thoughts whirled, a blob of pitch-black Demonic Flame leapt into being in Yang Kai’s hand, mercilessly burning the little beast.

No matter how the beast struggled, it could not escape Yang Kai’s grip. As the Formation Eye, the cloud-beast possessed no real combat strength — perhaps some other strange ability — but it had no time to use it.

In the blink of an eye the little beast was burned down into what looked like a wooden talisman, which unexpectedly appeared before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was surprised for a moment and snatched the wooden tag into his hand.

As the beast died, the cloud beasts that had been entangling Fei Zhi Tu and the others, the ones dueling with the Fire Bird and Lian Guang, and the countless drifting clouds around them all surged toward the wooden tag.

It was as if an astonishing suction issued from the tag; every cloud was swallowed into it.

In just three breaths the danger was gone; the cloud sea that had covered the world shattered, and when everyone regained their senses they found themselves standing by the flowerbed, the purple Sword Soul Grass still standing straight as a blade.

The Light-Splitting Cloud Sea Formation was completely broken!

Yet no one spoke. They stood rooted, staring at the wooden talisman in Yang Kai’s hand with palpable envy — Fei Zhi Tu and the others included.

Cai He and Du Sisi’s gazes could be described as fanatically intense.

At this moment the wooden tag emitted a pure white light that made it hard to look at; spiritual qi brimmed from it, clearly not an ordinary object.

"A Formation Talisman! Could this be the fabled Formation Talisman?" Du Sisi cried out, drawing everyone’s attention.

"It really is a Formation Talisman!" Fei Zhi Tu’s Adam’s apple bobbed; his expression was complicated. Though he had suspected as much, he hadn’t dared to be certain. Hearing Du Sisi’s exclamation confirmed his guess.

This was an exceedingly rare Formation Talisman!

Everyone present had heard of the Talisman’s rarity and value. Wen was greatly vexed that such a treasure had slipped past him to Yang Kai.

If he had leapt forward to seize the little beast earlier, the talisman might have become his; such a talisman was far more precious than an Origin-Grade secret treasure.

"Brother Yang…" Cai He called out, but was stunned when Yang Kai nonchalantly stored the talisman into his Spatial Ring, standing there puzzled.

"Ahem…" Fei Zhi Tu cleared his throat. "Since the boy obtained it, it’s his fate. Treasure it well."

Hearing this, Ning Xiangchen thought for a moment then laughed, "Congratulations to the young friend for taking this extraordinary treasure; your strength will increase greatly."

The old woman and Wen considered it and offered their congratulations as well, evidently agreeing with Fei Zhi Tu and showing no intent to seize or share the talisman.

After all, they had come primarily to rescue Qian Tong; acquiring this talisman was accidental. Making a fuss over it now would be unwise.

Moreover, the three Origin Returning Realm men all wished to befriend Yang Kai and borrow his Fire Bird Artifact Spirit.

With consensus among the many Origin Returning Realm cultivators, the remaining three Saint King Realm men had little room to object.

Du Sisi nearly puckered her mouth to the sky, her expression resentful as she stared at Yang Kai. He clearly knew nothing of Formation Arts or the Talisman’s value, yet he obtained it — utterly unfair.

Had the talisman fallen to her, Du Sisi’s family’s formation techniques might have leapt to a new level and finally suppressed the Cai clan.

Cai He could only resign himself and congratulate Yang Kai, though his smile was bitter. He didn’t mind losing items ordinarily, but this talisman meant far too much to a family famed for formations.

Yang Kai frowned faintly. He had never heard of a Formation Talisman, but from everyone’s reactions it was clear he’d gotten something extraordinary.

He was too lazy to ask and planned to wait until returning to Dragon Lair Mountain to ask Yang Yan about the talisman.

Accidentally encountering a Sword Soul Grass and then facing such danger made everyone realize this ancient ruin was not as peaceful as it seemed; rather, it brimmed with peril — one misstep and one could fall into a forbidden formation.

Naturally, no one dared be complacent.

"Rest here first and recover; if we encounter anything along the road don’t act rashly," Fei Zhi Tu said, then walked aside to sit in meditation.

Everyone nodded, producing Saint Crystals and pills to begin recovery.
