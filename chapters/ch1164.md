## Chapter 1164 — Of Course I'll Go

In the private room of Yingyue Hall, Qian Tong sat motionless for a long time, a trace of annoyance creasing his brow; if he had known in advance that even after collecting thirty million as a passage fee he still couldn't win that single Origin Condensing Pill, he would have bought the Dragon-Slaying Whip at any cost and given it to his disciple.

Now he had gained nothing, and naturally he felt some regret.

He waited for the length of an incense stick before Qian Tong finally said to the Yingyue Hall disciples standing nearby, "You may go back first. The Flowing Flame Sandland will open soon; train well when you return."

The disciples all nodded and left in unison, leaving only the younger disciples Wei Guchang and Xuan'er behind; Qian Tong rose and said, "You two come with me, I'll take you to meet someone."

"Yes." Wei Guchang and Xuan'er obediently followed behind him.

Inside Room C-13, Wu Yi took out some Saint Crystals and gave them to the two female disciples of Yingyue Hall who had been attending to them. After receiving the gift with joyful thanks, the two were dismissed.

The three waited and waited, but Qian Tong did not appear.

Just as boredom set in, a knock sounded at the door. Yang Kai gave Wu Yi a look; she hurried to open it and Qian Tong entered smiling, leading a man and a woman by the hand.

"Nephew Yang, sorry to have kept you waiting," Qian Tong said, cupping his hands in polite greeting.

"Senior, you're too courteous; I had nothing else to do anyway," Yang Kai rose to welcome him.

Hearing Yang Kai shift how he addressed him — from calling him Elder Qian to now saying "Senior" with a touch of respect — Qian Tong's face brightened and his smile grew even broader; he knew full well this change stemmed from the help he'd provided today and that Yang Kai felt some gratitude.

He didn't make a point of it and, following Yang Kai's invitation, sat down.

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er, who had trailed Qian Tong in, looked oddly out of place. At first they thought they'd be presented to some elder of standing, but when they arrived they found themselves before a youth younger than either of them, his strength not particularly high — only the First Stage of the Saint King Realm.

What about such a person warranted their elder's solemn treatment? They had been following Qian Tong for some time and had even detected a hint of cautiousness in his words and manner.

He couldn't possibly be from one of the three top forces. Who was this fellow really?

"And these two are..." Yang Kai eyed Wei Guchang and Xuan'er with feigned puzzlement. Although he had already guessed their identities, he pretended not to know for the time being.

Qian Tong had some purpose in bringing them, Yang Kai thought, and with only a moment's thought he understood what it must be.

Qian Tong seemed to have just remembered and chuckled, “Ah, I forgot to introduce you, Nephew.”

Pointing to the tall, imposing man, he said, “This is Wei Guchang, the most gifted disciple my Yingyue Hall has seen in centuries.” Then, gesturing to the woman, he added, “And this is my humble disciple, Dong Xuan’er. You two, hurry and greet Brother Yang.”

On hearing Qian Tong's introductions, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er were inwardly shocked; it was normally juniors who bowed to elders, and among peers respect was ordered by rank and realm. This Yang Kai fellow was obscure and his realm far lower than theirs — why would an elder ask them to bow first?

Thinking this, both of them hesitated and for the first time did not automatically follow Qian Tong's instructions.

Qian Tong saw their puzzlement at once. Though these two disciples were well behaved and lacked the bad temper of many from great forces, they had pride; even if Fang Tianzhong and Qu Changfeng stood here, they would not willingly lower themselves — these people dealt with each other as equals.

Qian Tong grew anxious inwardly, worried their attitude would offend Yang Kai; if Yang Kai took offense then all his prior efforts would be for nothing. He inwardly berated himself — had he told them clearly before coming, this awkwardness could have been avoided.

Yang Kai paid it no mind; with a light laugh he clasped his hands and said, "Ah — Brother Wei, I've long heard your name; it's thunderous to the ear!"

He had only heard Wei Guchang's name today, so the words were insincere, but Qian Tong's face had to be saved.

Wei Guchang inclined his head slightly, clasped his fist in return, and said nothing.

Yang Kai then turned to Xuan'er, "Greetings, Miss Dong."

Xuan'er returned the salute with composure and grace, remaining silent like Wei Guchang.

Qian Tong gave a little laugh, "Old Qian is getting on in years; you're all about the same age, you should get to know each other well in the future."

Yang Kai remained noncommittal, and Wei Guchang and Xuan'er offered no further expression; they saw no necessity to cozy up to Yang Kai. Although the elder seemed to value him, only true strength could earn their respect; mere status, however grand, would not make them bow.

Qian Tong felt his plan had gone a bit awry. He had brought Wei Guchang and Xuan'er precisely because they were of similar age and it would be easy to befriend them — if Yang Kai made friends, the benefits would follow — yet he'd underestimated their pride.

Slightly disheartened, he had them step out to wait.

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er bowed and took their leave, as if their sole purpose had been to see Yang Kai for a moment.

After they departed, Qian Tong forced a wry smile and said, "Forgive me, Nephew; this old man has poor instruction."

Yang Kai shook his head, "I've met many promising youths from Dark Star today; to be frank, those two left a better impression on me than the rest."

Qu Changfeng need not be mentioned — Yang Kai disliked that sort of person. When Fang Tianzhong had squared off with Qu Changfeng in front of Jubao Tower, he had shown no concern for others; had Yang Kai not been strong enough, he would have been embarrassed on the spot. As for Yin Sudie, she did not appear a virtuous woman — young in years yet smooth and artful in speech and action.

At least Wei Guchang and Xuan'er lacked those faults; their characters were more straightforward, which was why Qian Tong had been put in an awkward spot.

Of course Yang Kai merely said this to reassure Qian Tong; he had no intention of taking the initiative to befriend those two — they had their pride, and so did he.

No one is perfect.

Sure enough, Yang Kai's words put Qian Tong completely at ease, and with a smile the elder began to chat with him.

After some idle talk, Yang Kai asked, "Elder, before the auction began you said you had something to discuss with me. What was it?"

Qian Tong's expression turned serious and he asked, "Have you heard of the Flowing Flame Sandland?"

Yang Kai looked at him in surprise, wondering if what Qian Tong sought to tell him was the same matter he'd meant to inquire about. He nodded slightly, "I've heard of it, and know of its strangeness."

"Good that you've heard," Qian Tong sipped his tea and continued, "Would you be willing to go to the Flowing Flame Sandland?"

"What do you mean, Elder?" Yang Kai didn't want to lay his own intent bare so quickly; he didn't know why Qian Tong had singled him out to mention this.

"Don't misunderstand," Qian Tong smiled. "Normally I wouldn't recommend someone go to the Flowing Flame Sandland — it's too dangerous; most who go suffer heavy losses. If six out of ten emerge alive, that's already commendable. But I heard you once slew a warrior of the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm — is that true?"

"It is."

Although Qian Tong had heard of such deeds from Luo Qing, Yang Kai's own admission still astonished him; he immediately recognized Yang Kai's combat prowess must be considerable, otherwise he could not have slain an opponent of higher rank.

"In that case you qualify to go. I just don't know if you yourself wish to take the risk; if you do, this old man can arrange for you to enter."

Yang Kai frowned, "Are there restrictions on entering?"

He had assumed that once the Flowing Flame Sandland opened, one could simply find a place and enter; he was hoping Qian Tong could tell him its location and opening times.

"Of course there are restrictions," Qian Tong said, surprised at his assumption. "You wouldn't think that place is open to all, would you?"

"I only knew it could be entered at special times."

Qian Tong smiled wryly, "It seems you don't understand the Flowing Flame Sandland very well."

"Please enlighten me, Senior," Yang Kai immediately asked.

"The Flowing Flame Sandland does open only at special times, but not everyone may go. First rule: those of the Origin Returning Realm cannot enter — if an Origin Returning cultivator goes in, death is certain!" Qian Tong spoke gravely.

"Why?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

"Because of Shi — Shi is a force unique to Origin Returning cultivators, and the Flowing Flame Sandland seems to forbid the existence of Shi. If an Origin Returning cultivator enters, whether they use Shi or not, they will immediately be burned to death!"

Yang Kai's face paled; he privately counted himself lucky he'd not developed Shi during his recent seclusion, or he would have missed this chance. It seemed every gain carried a loss.

Wu Yi and Yang Yan listened with wide eyes; clearly they had not known this information.

"This was discovered at the cost of many lives by our elders on Dark Star," Qian Tong sighed. "Moreover, strength alone isn't everything in the Flowing Flame Sandland. When it opens the heat's power does lessen somewhat, but it's still beyond what ordinary Saint Realm cultivators can withstand — only Saint King cultivators go. You're only at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm; if I hadn't heard you can fight above your Stage I wouldn't have mentioned it. Ultimately, whether you go is your own decision."

"I'll go. Such a rare opportunity must not be wasted," Yang Kai grinned; that place was an ideal spot to refine Profound Yin Moon Water.

Qian Tong looked at him approvingly, "I knew you weren't content to remain mediocre. Since you've decided, take one of Yingyue Hall's slots — we have no need for it anyway."
