## Chapter 2310 — Not a Secret Technique

Yang Kai gave a faint smile, looking at Chai Hu with a touch of sympathy. Instead of answering, he asked, "Does it feel heartbreaking and hopeless? The person you risked your life to save actually attacked you from behind. That feeling must be hard to bear, right?"

Chai Hu's face was ashen, his single eye fixed fiercely on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai said, "She didn't act of her own will."

Chai Hu was startled, gritting his teeth. "You mean... she was controlled by someone?" As he spoke, he cast a hateful glance at the middle-aged man held by Yang Kai, his face brimming with murderous intent. "Is it him?"

Yang Kai burst out laughing. "You finally understand."

Chai Hu looked deeply regretful. "I should've realized it sooner, I should've! How could Fifth Sister attack me from behind? Damn it! I should've figured it out! How could I be so stupid? I, Chai Hu, am the dumbest person in the world!"

He shouted, his face full of guilt and self-reproach.

"Eldest Brother..." Luo Bing's face was covered in tears, whether from fear or something else. She rushed forward, pushing away the City Lord’s mansion martial artists who had been holding Chai Hu, then spread her arms like a mother hen, shielding Chai Hu. She cried, "Eldest Brother, go! I'll hold them off!"

She herself didn't know why she acted this way. Just yesterday, before meeting Chai Hu in that crisis, she was still the princess of the City Lord’s mansion, cherished and carefree, living happily every day. But in just one night, she felt she had suddenly grown a lot. Seeing Chai Hu's guilt-ridden, heartbroken expression, she felt an inexplicable ache and acted without thinking.

"Bing'er!" Luo Jin erupted in fury, his eyes blazing as he glared at his daughter. He never expected his always obedient child to defy him so publicly, even protecting the man who ruined his concubine ceremony! He felt dizzy, the fire in his heart burning fiercely.

"Father, please let Eldest Brother go. I beg you, he's my savior! You can't hurt him!" Luo Bing knelt, crying bitterly and pleading.

A complex emotion flickered in Chai Hu's single eye as he stared blankly at the delicate figure before him, his heart a mix of feelings.

The surrounding guests were moved, gazing at the weeping Luo Bing with newfound respect.

"Well done, Miss Bing." Yang Kai laughed heartily from the side, giving Luo Bing a thumbs up and looking at her with admiration. He shouted, "Don't worry, your Eldest Brother won't be harmed today. I stake my life on it!"

Luo Bing's eyes lit up at his words. She turned to Yang Kai and asked, "Really? You promise?"

Yang Kai replied solemnly, "I promise!"

Luo Bing wiped her tears, joyfully said, "Thank you. Thank you! Take him away quickly. Eldest Brother's cultivation is sealed. He can't leave on his own, but you're strong enough to get him out."

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. "I can't. My business isn't finished yet. Once it is, I'll take him away." Pausing, he smiled. "Of course, if Miss Bing wants to come with us, you're welcome."

"Me?" Luo Bing was stunned, glancing at her father, then at Chai Hu behind her. She gave a sorrowful smile. "No, I'll stay with my father."

Luo Jin closed his eyes, his tone heavy. "Bing'er, if you don't return to your room and keep spouting nonsense, you are no longer my daughter!"

He'd had enough, feeling that he'd spoiled Luo Bing too much, which had brought shame upon him today. The pain in his heart far outweighed his anger at Yang Kai and Chai Hu for ruining the ceremony.

Luo Bing's body trembled, her tearful eyes pitifully looking at her father, tears falling like broken pearls. Luo Jin had never been so harsh with her, never spoken such cruel words, leaving her stunned and unable to react.

"As for you all..." Though angry at his daughter's defiance, seeing her like that, Luo Jin couldn't bear to look at her and vented all his fury on Yang Kai. He turned to Yang Kai, snarling, "None of you are leaving today! Activate the formation!"

As his words fell, the City Lord’s mansion suddenly hummed, a surge of energy rising. Outside, a solid light barrier appeared, clearly a formation sealing off the entire mansion.

"Just as I wanted!" Yang Kai laughed. "Now, until things are settled, no one is running!"

"This kid is crazy, truly crazy!"

"He dares challenge the City Lord’s mansion alone. Where does he get such confidence? Youthful arrogance, it seems. Looks like he'll meet his end here."

"Why worry? Just watch the show."

A wave of chatter spread. After the commotion, the guests retreated, leaving a large open space in the center for Yang Kai and the middle-aged man he'd subdued.

"Speak. How did you control the bride? I have little patience. If you can't satisfy me, I'll kill you right now." Yang Kai's palm pulsed with Origin Qi as he stared coldly at the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man, only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—one stage below Yang Kai—turned pale, sweat pouring from his forehead. He stammered, "Young Brother, you... you must be mistaken..."

Before he could finish, Yang Kai suddenly raised his hand and sliced at the man's arm.

Pfft—

A soft sound rang out as the man watched his arm fly off, bursting into a cloud of blood in midair. Blood spurted from the wound like a fountain.

"Ah, my arm!" The man screamed in agony, his features twisted in pain.

"This is just a small warning. Next time, it'll be your head!" Yang Kai's eyes flashed coldly. "No matter what method you used to control the bride, I figure if you die... she'll be freed, right?"

The man shuddered, terror and shock on his face. He glanced at Luo Jin, who shook his head slightly.

Gritting his teeth, the man shouted, "Even if you kill me... it won't help! If I die, the bride dies too!"

At these words, the guests erupted, while Luo Jin's face darkened.

Though the man hadn't revealed much, his words said enough. If the bride agreed to the marriage, why would Luo Jin have her controlled? If she were willing, there'd be no need for this.

In other words, she was forced to marry Luo Jin.

Hearing this, Chai Hu's single eye suddenly shone with joy, and he grinned foolishly, as if a weight had been lifted from his heart.

Seeing his happiness, Luo Bing couldn't help but smile through her tears, her beauty radiant.

"Trying to fool me?" Yang Kai snorted coldly, his face fierce. "Do you know the price of lying to me?"

"I'm not lying!" the man cried. "Every word I said is true!"

Yang Kai stared at him, seeing no sign of deceit, and nodded. "Fine. In that case, lift the secret technique."

The man looked troubled and shook his head repeatedly.

"Do you want to die?" Yang Kai shouted.

The man said, "If I don't lift it, you won't dare kill me! But if I do, I'll die for sure!"

Everyone immediately understood his meaning.

If he didn't lift the technique, Yang Kai would hesitate to kill him. But if he did, not only might Yang Kai turn on him, Luo Jin definitely wouldn't spare him.

Today, Luo Jin had lost all face. If the man didn't please him, Luo Jin would never let him go. He tolerated Luo Bing, was helpless against Yang Kai, but this man—he'd grind his bones to dust.

Yang Kai raised his brows. "You've got it all figured out!"

The man gave a miserable smile. "Circumstances forced me. I hope Young Brother won't blame me!"

"Then tell me, what kind of secret technique is it?" Yang Kai pressed.

The man glanced timidly at Luo Jin, whose cold, stern look made him quickly avert his eyes.

"Looks like you're dead-set against cooperating. Fine, I won't kill you, but I can cut off your limbs!" Yang Kai sneered, raising his hand to do just that.

"Wait!" The man turned pale, whether from blood loss or fear, and cried out.

"What else do you have to say?" Yang Kai demanded.

The man hesitated, then gritted his teeth. "It's not a secret technique..."

"Not a secret technique?" Yang Kai raised his brows. "Then what did you use to control the bride?"

The man wailed, "I can't say! Young Brother, please spare me. That's all I can tell you. I have elders and children at home, and I live in Tianhe City. Please show mercy..."

Yang Kai stared coldly at him, knowing that pressing further would get nowhere. He angrily tossed the man toward the Thousand Leaves Sect. "Miss Ye, watch him for me. If he tries anything, kill him!"

"Oh!" Ye Qinghan snapped back to her senses, quickly grabbing the man and restraining him.

Only then did Yang Kai turn to the bride.

This time, the bride didn't attack him. She stood like a statue, but as Yang Kai approached, her breathing grew rapid, her body trembling with excitement.
