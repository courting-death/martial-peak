## Chapter 1612 — Young People

Luo Hai had already treated that Void Mind Crystal as good as in his own pouch!

He had the confidence and the qualification. After all, as the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, so long as Yang Kai remained on Cuiwei Star, he would never be able to slip free of his control.

Then he would fetch the crystal from that brat, give him some reward, and everyone would be happy.

If the boy was willing, Lord Luo Hai even felt he could take him on as a disciple!

It would be a tremendous honor, a chance others could never beg for.

For years Luo Hai had never felt so stirred, and at this moment he was nearly beside himself! Had he not feared that other Void King Realm cultivators in the stone pavilion might notice some flaw, he would have laughed aloud long ago.

“Lord Luo Hai, the Blood Prison will close in about ten days, won’t it?” the old woman surnamed Lei suddenly asked.

“Yes.” Lord Luo Hai nodded upon hearing this. “Indeed, only about ten days remain. When that time comes the domain within the Blood Prison will fully erupt in power, and those little ones will have no choice but to withdraw.”

“Heh heh—let us hope their gains this time are worthwhile. By the way, that brat at the Second Stage, is he safe?”

At the mention of Yang Kai everyone opened their eyes and looked toward Lord Luo Hai; plainly they all cared whether Yang Kai lived or died.

“He is safe. I judge he will be able to walk out alive; you needn’t worry about his safety,” Lord Luo Hai said.

“Good, good—so long as he can come out alive, I will at once invite him to join the Sword Alliance!” the old woman cried in delight.

“That youth has boundless prospects. Though there have been a few reckless Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivators who entered the Blood Prison, none walked out alive—many couldn’t even survive a few days inside. If he can achieve this, his future will surely be radiant!”

“I cannot wait to see this brat and learn what background he has,” another murmured.

“Indeed, from his performance I believe he will take an honored seat in the Star Domain in years to come.”

They all praised Yang Kai in turns; Lord Luo Hai smiled without interrupting, for only he knew that Yang Kai was even more outstanding than they imagined.

……

In the cave on Yao Hill, Yang Kai was lost in rapture, his mind and body immersed in marvelous enlightenment, utterly unaware of how time passed.

After a while his brow twitched and he opened his eyes.

He sensed that the atmosphere within the Blood Prison had subtly shifted; at the Yao Hill there was even a faint stream of Domain power flowing through.

Before coming here Chi Yue had warned that the moment the aura inside the Blood Prison changed, one must leave immediately; otherwise one would die without a burial place.

When such a change occurs, within five days the entire Blood Prison becomes forbidden ground no one can set foot in, filled with chaotic field-energies, and it will not settle again for a thousand years.

It was time to leave!

He rose slowly and examined what he had gained, smiling broadly.

He felt his comprehension of Shi had cleared greatly; he was only one step shy of completion. That last step seemed close yet was like a thin membrane blocking his understanding of Shi.

Still, it was nothing serious; having absorbed the soul-energy of Yao King Feng E, once he fully fathomed and understood it, perfecting his Shi would not be difficult.

Moreover, when he later advanced to the Void King Realm, forming his own Domain would be effortless.

Such benefits he could not enjoy yet; only when his strength reached the Void King Realm would they reveal themselves.

He stepped out of the cave, checked his bearings, flashed like a bolt of light, and soon vanished from sight.

Two days later Yang Kai reappeared leisurely in a basin-shaped valley.

“You’re back, brat!” A figure suddenly slipped out from the side and landed before Yang Kai, smiling at him.

“Senior Ba He!” Yang Kai nodded lightly to him.

“I thought you were dead. There hasn’t been any news of you!” Yu Xiong also popped out from some corner, boisterously greeting Yang Kai and eyeballing him as if to see whether any limbs were missing.

“Yang Kai!” Shan Qingluo’s smile blossomed as she moved to his side and hooked her arm through his.

Xue Sun appeared right behind Shan Qingluo, giving Yang Kai only a faint nod with no great display.

“Everyone’s here.” Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Did you secure the thing the foster mother entrusted?” Yu Xiong strode up to within three zhang of Yang Kai and asked in a buzzing voice.

Yang Kai reached into his Spatial Ring and drew out a round, crystal-like object, casually tossing it to Yu Xiong.

Yu Xiong caught it nervously and held it in the palm of his hand, examining it closely.

Instantly every pair of eyes was drawn to that seemingly pure and flawless crystal; each gaze burned with intensity.

“Is this… the Void Mind Crystal?” Ba He swallowed and stared at it without blinking; even the normally composed Xue Sun’s breath quickened considerably.

“This isn’t a fake, is it?” Yu Xiong glanced up at Yang Kai.

“What do you think?” Yang Kai sneered.

“Doesn’t look like a fake!” Yu Xiong shook his big head and hurriedly fetched a jade box from his Spatial Ring, carefully placing the Void Mind Crystal inside and storing it away. He then looked up at Yang Kai with a complex expression and said, “You’re straightforward, brat. This is the half-volume of the Yao Transformation Technique given to you by our foster mother—take it.”

With that he tossed a tome-like object at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai took it, skimmed through and checked it, and when satisfied nodded: “The task Senior Chi Yue assigned is complete. The things are in your hands now; I have nothing further to do with them.”

“Don’t worry.” Yu Xiong chuckled. “With so many of us here, we won’t lose it.”

Yang Kai said no more, glanced at Shan Qingluo and lowered his voice: “Come with me—there is something I want to say to you.”

“All right.” Shan Qingluo nodded and followed Yang Kai a short distance away.

As if sensing something, Shan Qingluo’s mood suddenly sank a little.

The rubble-strewn mound was desolate and without charm.

Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo looked at each other, and an atmosphere of reluctant parting hung between them.

After a long silence, Yang Kai finally sighed and asked, “I ran into a few people earlier—they seemed to have clashed with you. One of them claimed to have wounded you. How bad is the injury?”

“It’s nothing. He only struck me from afar with his Saint Yuan—doesn’t even count as a light wound.” Shan Qingluo slowly shook her head. “Those people… they’re dead, aren’t they?”

Given they had met Yang Kai, it would have been strange for them to live.

“Yes.”

“You’re far stronger than me now. Back in Cangyun Evil Land I was the one protecting you,” Shan Qingluo laughed softly.

How many years had it been? That youth who once first set out into the world had already surpassed her—even despite her bearing the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider’s Origin Power.

“Those were good times,” Yang Kai said with a reflective look, a suggestive smile playing at his lips.

Shan Qingluo clearly understood his meaning and cast him an impassioned, teasing glance.

“Are you going back to Di Chen?” Yang Kai suddenly asked.

“My foster mother did me a great kindness. I cannot simply leave. Besides, I do not wish to become a burden to you. I am half-yao now, and Di Chen is the most suitable place for my cultivation. If I leave with you, I will only be a weight on your shoulders—I won’t allow it!” Shan Qingluo’s face darkened.

The pressure Yang Kai placed on her was immense. If she wished to stay by this man’s side for life, she couldn’t afford to indulge in fleeting pleasures—Shan Qingluo understood that better than anyone.

Yang Kai nodded gently to show his understanding.

He had already considered these matters, so her words at this moment surprised him not at all.

“And you? Are you leaving?” she asked.

“Yes.” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “I’ve brought the people out of Zhongdu and Tongxuan Continent. I will take them to a cultivation star called Dark Star; it’s very remote. If there is a chance, I will come to Di Chen to see you again.”

Shan Qingluo bit her red lip and clenched her small fist; in those soul-enticing eyes a trace of wistfulness appeared. She said in a low voice, “We parted once before and did not meet again for thirty years. If we part today, who knows when we will see each other next.”

Yang Kai reached out with his large hand, took hers, drew her into his embrace, and placed her hand over his heart.

Shan Qingluo looked up; her eyes brightened and shone with astonishing radiance.

Flushing slightly, she clasped Yang Kai’s hand and likewise laid his palm upon her own heart.

You have me in your heart. I have you in mine. Both understood without words...

She rose onto her toes, eyes closed, long lashes trembling, and pressed her lips to Yang Kai’s.

“Young people…” Ba He let out a long sigh from not far away, hands clasped behind his back as he stood there, gazing up at the sky.

“Looks like that brother-in-law position of mine is locked in,” Yu Xiong chuckled foolishly, waggling his brows at Xue Sun beside him.

Xue Sun’s face flushed to the nape of her neck; she hung her head and stared at the ground as if trying to find an ant.

Breath quickening, Yang Kai’s blood roared as he tasted Shan Qingluo’s sweetness; though the Enchantress Queen was alluring and overturned hearts, this was her first time and she was inexperienced and a little outmatched.

Before long, Shan Qingluo was utterly routed—armor shattered, defenses in disarray. Her whole body felt as if cast adrift among the clouds, rising and falling, no longer her own to command.

Suddenly Yang Kai cried out and pressed a hand to his mouth.

Taking the chance, Shan Qingluo slipped from his grasp and stepped back a few paces, a rosy afterglow on her face as she glared at Yang Kai through gritted teeth.

“Why did you bite me?” Yang Kai whined with mock grievance.

“I’ll leave you something to remember me by—so you don’t forget me with time!” Shan Qingluo let out a soft, tinkling laugh, but before long tears began to fall. Her voice dropped to a whisper. “Go now… if you don’t, I’m afraid I won’t be able to let you leave.”

She seemed to have made an excruciating decision; her delicate body trembled.

Yang Kai licked his lips and nodded: “Then take care of yourself.”

Having said that, he took a Spatial Ring from his person and handed it to Shan Qingluo: “Take this and keep it safe—don’t tell anyone.”

“What’s inside?” Shan Qingluo asked suspiciously.

“You’ll see later.” Yang Kai grinned without explaining, glanced toward where Ba He and the others stood, and called out loudly: “You all should leave too—no need to wait for Xue Lian and the others.”

With that, the Spatial Force wrapped Yang Kai and in the blink of an eye he vanished from the spot.

Shan Qingluo opened her mouth but in the end shouted nothing.
