## Chapter 1660 — The Fateful Cold Pool

Su Yan was released from the Xuan Realm Pearl by Yang Kai and set off alone for Ice Jue Peak.

Although Yang Kai did not know exactly why Luo Li wished to see Su Yan, he could feel that the woman bore no ill will toward her; he even had a faint sense that this was a providential opportunity for Su Yan.

Su Yan’s uncanny appearance left the elders of Ice Heart Valley who had been guarding outside the loft utterly stunned.

None of them had seen Su Yan enter the loft, yet she had walked out from within.

For a time, no one could make sense of how such a thing could have happened.

Yang Kai remained inside the loft and began to refine pills.

Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills are not something that can be concocted at will; according to Yang Kai’s comprehension of the True Alchemy Formula, to refine a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill one must have an exceptional Pill Guide.

The Pill Guide must possess spirit; only then can the pill refined be called a Spiritual Pill.

Yang Kai selected a high-quality demonic beast Inner Core to serve as the Pill Guide.

A Demonic Beast’s Inner Core contains its essence, energy, and spirit, making it naturally full of spirituality — it certainly meets the requirements.

Yang Kai did not possess the Inner Core of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast, nor did Ice Heart Valley, but there were several peak Ninth-Tier demonic beast Inner Cores in Ice Heart Valley’s stores, and one of those had been provided among the materials.

For the next three days, Yang Kai remained in seclusion and did not come out.

Strange sounds and movements came from the loft from time to time, and soon a fragrance drifted out from the loft for ten thousand zhang.

Bing Long and the others, who had previously heard some of the news from Luo Li, stood outside the loft stunned, their jaws nearly dropping from astonishment.

Yang Kai truly was an outstanding alchemist; though it remained uncertain whether he could actually refine a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill, the mere scale of the commotion was enough to prove his deep attainments in pillcraft.

But how could this be possible?

Yang Kai did not appear very old, and the fact that his cultivation had reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm was already incredible—how could he still have spare time and energy to delve so far into alchemy?

Only now did Bing Long and the others begin to realize what a terrifying existence Yang Kai truly was.

Their gazes upon the loft gradually turned reverent.

As time passed, the odd noises from the loft grew ever more pronounced; myriad gleams of colored light streamed out, and the pill fragrance in the air thickened, filling noses with a scent that seemed to enlighten and soothe every person’s body and spirit.

Three days flew by, and the loft’s door opened on its own.

Yang Kai’s voice came from within: “Senior Sister Bing Long, please come in and speak.”

Bing Long’s expression turned solemn and she hurried forward.

She entered the loft and did not stay long before coming out again, her face tense yet elated.

“Valley Lord, what is the situation?” Great Elder Ran Yunting and the others looked on eagerly; they had heard the same news that Yang Kai had been refining a Spiritual Pill for the Grand Elder these past days and were impatient to learn the result.

Bing Long said nothing; she revealed a pure white jade vial in her hand, then wordlessly returned it to her Spatial Ring and sped toward Ice Jue Peak.

“Could it truly be completed?” Ran Yunting’s face turned ashen as she murmured to herself.

The other Elders watched Bing Long’s departing figure, then turned their gazes toward Ran Yunting. A few of them let out faint sighs, with a trace of reproach flickering deep within their eyes.

They all understood that, placed in Ran Yunting’s position when Chi Huo and Luo Hai had descended upon Ice Heart Valley that day, they might have made the same choice—abandon Su Yan to preserve the sect.

Yet Yang Kai’s strange conduct and enormous potential filled them with regret.

If at that moment they had not acted as they did and had fought to protect Su Yan to the death… how much better that would have been; they might have established ties with Yang Kai.

A Void King-Grade alchemist—what an incomparably noble status that was!

Inside the loft, Yang Kai sat with his eyes closed, regulating his breath. Refining a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill had given him much insight. Luo Li also needed time to assimilate the pill’s effects to repair her wounds and mend hidden dangers to her mind, so he could ponder boldly.

Once Luo Li’s wounds were healed, it would be time to launch a major assault on the Fire Radiance Sect.

Part of Yang Kai’s desire to destroy the Fire Radiance Sect stemmed from the matter of the Qiantian Thunderflame; the Fire Radiance Sect’s experts he had previously encountered cultivated the Qiantian Thunderfire secret art, which greatly enhanced the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

Another part of the reason was simply that they had provoked a person they should never have provoked.

Yang Kai himself had had several run-ins and grievances with that sect and held them in deep contempt.

After a day, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes and nodded in satisfaction.

Indeed, improvement in the Art of Pill Refining comes from practice; refining a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill had allowed him to accumulate considerable experience. With sufficient materials and regular practice, Yang Kai believed his alchemy could rise sharply.

A look from the side drew his attention; Yang Kai turned and saw Qing Ya hesitating as if about to speak.

“Senior Sister Qing Ya, speak plainly,” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “Are you asking me to refine a pill for you as well?”

“No, no.” Qing Ya quickly waved her hand, hesitating a moment before finally saying, “It’s about Qian Hao.”

“Qian Hao…” Yang Kai nodded; he remembered the former elder of the Ice Sect, the elder brother of Qian Yue.

In the past he had come to Chi Lan Star with Qing Ya and Su Yan, but because of his gender he could not enter Ice Heart Valley; Ran Yunting had arranged for him to be placed in a subordinate sect of Ice Heart Valley, and he had apparently fared well these years.

“You want him to leave that sect?” Yang Kai immediately understood Qing Ya’s meaning.

“Yes. Now that Su Yan and I are no longer disciples of Ice Heart Valley, if Qian Hao remains in that sect he will inevitably be looked down upon. Since the few of us are reunited, it’s unreasonable to leave Qian Hao alone outside. I want him back.”

“That’s easy.” Yang Kai smiled slightly, probed outside with his Divine Sense, and transmitted a few words to someone.

Shortly after, he smiled at Qing Ya and said, “Qian Hao will come tomorrow; then the few of you from the Ice Sect will be reunited.”

“Thank you.” Qing Ya was deeply moved.

In past days the Ice Sect had been a formidable force on Tongxuan Continent. Though its disciples were few and its reputation not flashy, any expert of some weight knew of the Ice Sect’s existence—isolated and untroubled.

But now the entire Ice Sect had dwindled to only four people.

Looking back on the past, Qing Ya cherished the present all the more.

Su Yan had found a good man! Qing Ya looked at Yang Kai with a faint, grateful smile.

Ice Heart Valley’s efficiency was high. The next day Qian Hao indeed came to Icebound Island; upon seeing Qing Ya he was warm and solicitous, and when he laid eyes on Yang Kai he was stunned as if he had seen a ghost.

He rubbed his eyes several times to confirm Yang Kai truly stood before him and it was not an illusion.

“Alright, you have much to say after this long separation. Relax your hearts; I’ll send you to a place where people are waiting for you!” Yang Kai smiled and told Qing Ya and Qian Hao.

The two did not ask many questions and immediately relaxed their minds.

Yang Kai spread his hand and an invisible force enveloped them. In the next moment Qing Ya and Qian Hao vanished and reappeared inside the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Brother and sister reunited—Qian Hao and Qian Yue wept with joy…

Ten days later Yang Kai suddenly received a summons from Luo Li and immediately left the loft for Ice Jue Peak.

Luo Li’s voice sounded much improved from before; the Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill must have taken effect. Yang Kai did not know precisely why she had asked him to come to Ice Jue Peak this time, but he suspected it had something to do with Su Yan.

Since the day Su Yan had entered Ice Jue Peak she had not reappeared.

Yang Kai was unconcerned; his sense told him Su Yan was safe.

Before long Yang Kai arrived at the summit of Ice Jue Peak. The summit was as barren as ever; apart from a draughty thatch shed there was nothing else.

Luo Li sat cross-legged inside the thatch shed, her breath even and her complexion unusually ruddy.

Her wounds were clearly healed.

“You’ve come.” Luo Li gestured for Yang Kai to sit down and speak.

Yang Kai glanced about and frowned. “Where is Su Yan?”

He could not find any trace of Su Yan here.

“You and Su Yan seem to share some strange spiritual bond—can you not sense where she is?” Luo Li smiled without answering directly.

Was this a test?

The corner of Yang Kai’s mouth curved slightly as his gaze immediately shifted toward a cold pond not far away.

The cold pool was only about five chi across; its water was crystal clear and of unknown depth. White vapors rose from the pool, and those vapors contained the purest of icy energies.

Yang Kai reflexively released his Divine Sense, then soon made a soft sound of surprise; his expression turned grave and he dared not act rashly.

He had noticed this cold pool the last time he visited, but had not examined it closely then. This time, probing with his Divine Sense, he was startled.

The pool actually contained a trace of Domain power; his Divine Sense could not extend far within it and was blocked and even frozen back.

Thanks to the Warm Spirit Lotus, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense was comparable to that of a true Void King Realm expert.

What kind of origin could this cold pool have to possess such might?

Yang Kai could clearly feel Su Yan positioned deep within the cold pool.

“This is the Ice Heart Valley’s Fateful Cold Pool,” Luo Li explained when she saw the look of confusion on Yang Kai’s face. “It stands alongside the Fire Radiance Sect’s Qiantian Thunderflame as one of Chi Lan Star’s two great divine legacies. Once you enter this cold pool, your very fate may defy the heavens — that is what people mean when they speak of this place.”

“What wondrous effects does it have?” Yang Kai asked, his eyes burning as he gazed at the cold pond, having also noticed its strange nature.

“For those who cultivate ice-based techniques, the Fateful Cold Pool is a godsend. Ice Heart Valley established itself here precisely because of this pool. Innately it can alter a warrior’s physique, making them better suited to the ice-cold energies of Heaven-and-Earth. Ice Heart Valley’s senior figures have all benefited from the pool.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, making no sign.

Luo Li continued, “All the Void King Realm experts of Ice Heart Valley, before passing away, would disperse their own domain fields and pour the power of those domains into this cold pond. Anyone who enters it can thereby comprehend the mysteries of the Ice Intent and the profound secrets of the Ice Domain.”
