## Chapter 770 — Comfort and Dependence

Life in the Small Xuan Realm passed in dull, uneventful days.

Gou Chi and another member of the demonic race spent their time idling; their True Yuan and Divine Sense had been sealed, so they couldn’t cultivate and were bored nearly to rot.

An Ling'er, though in the same situation, was a woman by nature more serene; she spent most of her time daydreaming, lost in thought over who knew what.

Compared to them, Yang Kai was unusually busy.

The Yang Clan sent a large supply of Spiritual Herbs and medicines; Yang Kai spent his days refining them into pills and ingesting them to absorb their effects, and each day he still had to go to the Divine Tree to pour in a few drops of Yang Liquid—his days were filled to the brim.

The Yang Clan’s medicinal materials were of high quality; using them for pill refinement, Yang Kai put his previous insights into practice and his alchemy steadily improved, with gratifying results.

The Yang Clan watched Yang Kai constantly, yet they still couldn’t figure out by what strange means he had soothed the Divine Tree.

Since he began insisting on visiting the Divine Tree every day, the tree no longer emitted those unstable energy fluctuations it once had.

All the Yang Clan rejoiced, convinced this human might be useful, and silently counted themselves lucky they hadn’t killed him outright.

Their only grievance was the enormous amount of materials Yang Kai consumed—he was like a bottomless pit that nothing could fill.

If he hadn’t been under their watch at all times, they would have already demanded to know what was going on.

Time slipped by; three, four months flashed past.

One day, after Yang Kai finished pouring Yang Liquid into the Divine Tree, his Spirit Body slipped into the trunk to inspect things as usual, and his eyes brightened at the sight before him.

Inside the trunk, the chaotic spirit-energy was now beating with rapid, vigorous pulses, like a butterfly about to break from its cocoon—full of life—and under Yang Kai’s Divine Sense he could sense subtle messages coming from within.

It seemed to want to communicate something to him but didn’t know how to express it.

Yang Kai’s expression changed; he realized the Divine Tree’s evolution had reached a critical point—at this rate, within a month or two its consciousness would be fully born, and it would become a different form of life.

After quietly soothing it for a while, Yang Kai withdrew his Spirit Body and, utterly spent, dropped down from the trunk; after resting a moment he strode straight to the Yang Clan expert on guard below and said, "Prepare yourselves—starting tomorrow, I will live here!"

"Live here?" the Yang Clan expert raised an eyebrow, looking somewhat surprised.

“Yes. There are matters I’m concerned about that require observation for a time, so I won’t be running back and forth; staying here means if anything happens to your Divine Tree I can detect it in time.”

“Living here isn’t the issue, kid, but I feel like you’re up to some trick.”

The Yang Clan expert eyed Yang Kai distrustfully.

“I’ll behave. As a monitored prisoner, I won’t make things hard for myself—you’re overthinking.” Yang Kai gave a light laugh.

“You’re sensible enough, but I’ll have to report to the leader first to see what he says.” The man nodded.

“Do it quickly. I’ll wait for your answer.” Yang Kai finished and walked directly toward the palace.

Back at the palace he told An Ling'er his plan; the woman immediately became tense and uneasy.

“If you leave, what will I do? Gou Chi and the others still live here.”

Yang Kai frowned, thinking it over.

Although Gou Chi seemed harmless enough, who could guarantee that without Yang Kai’s protection he wouldn’t behave indecently toward An Ling'er? And there was another demonic person with him as well.

Demons were violent and cruel, acting on whim; reasoning with them was pointless.

“Then come with me. I’ll tell them I need someone to serve and take care of me; they probably won’t make trouble over that.” Yang Kai thought a moment and said.

“Okay.” An Ling'er quickly nodded and relaxed.

The next day the Yang Clan expert came to the palace and informed Yang Kai that the leader had agreed to his request; Yang Kai seized the opportunity to raise An Ling'er’s situation.

The expert pondered and then agreed, no longer needing to report back to the leader.

After informing Gou Chi and the others, Yang Kai left the palace with An Ling'er.

Beneath the Divine Tree, An Ling'er temporarily settled in; the Yang Clan did not allow her to fly onto the trunk like Yang Kai, only permitting her to remain beneath the tree.

So long as she wasn’t too far from Yang Kai she felt safe. She knew her current safety was entirely due to Yang Kai’s protection—without him she might be blood-sacrificed or turned into the Yang Clan’s plaything, neither of which she wished for.

On the tree, after inputting a few drops of Yang Liquid, Yang Kai observed the responses of that mass of chaotic spirit-energy; as before, the Divine Tree still wanted to communicate but couldn’t express itself clearly.

A comforting ripple passed from Yang Kai’s Spirit Body, calming its agitation and gently guiding it bit by bit.

Strangely, after so long receiving Yang Liquid and Divine Sense solace, the Divine Tree had developed a strong dependency on Yang Kai—his soothing not only calmed it but brought it waves of contented ease.

Time flowed on without incident.

Each day Yang Kai’s subtle spirit-communications with the Divine Tree and his visits to keep An Ling'er company filled his time.

To ensure the Divine Tree could evolve as soon as possible, Yang Kai avoided using even the True Yang Technique lest he draw energy from it and delay its progress.

The Divine Tree’s tiny changes went unnoticed by others, save for Yang Kai who tried to communicate with it every day.

That mass of chaotic spirit-energy seemed to have reached a limit and was about to undergo an unimaginable change.

After Yang Kai and An Ling'er had lived beside the Divine Tree for over a month, one day when Yang Kai once more sent his Spirit Body into the trunk, the tree’s spirit-energy suddenly burst with a wave of joy, as if it had long awaited his arrival.

At the same time, Yang Kai clearly felt a faint consciousness being born within that energy.

Startled, Yang Kai cautiously extended his Divine Sense power and slowly approached the heart of the Divine Tree.

The instant his Divine Sense touched the Divine Tree’s heart, the heart emitted a scorching aura that instantly enveloped Yang Kai’s Spirit Body.

From deep within his mind came unusual sounds, like a gurgling infant cooing in a parent’s arms, heedless of its strength.

Yang Kai felt uncomfortable at once.

Fortunately, his Spirit Body contained elements of Divine Sense Fire; otherwise, anyone enveloped by the Divine Tree’s heart would have their soul torn apart.

He hurriedly sent forth his thoughts; the aura hesitated and slowly retreated, unwilling but gentle.

Yang Kai smiled wryly, thinking the Divine Tree’s heart was no different from a bewildered infant, instinctively seeking closeness to those it perceived as kin.

It still wasn’t fully evolved and remained at the final threshold, only one step from completion.

Perceiving its despondence, Yang Kai poured benevolent, soothing intent into the tree’s heart, and it immediately brightened again.

Two hours later the Divine Tree’s heart gradually calmed and seemed to fall into slumber, no longer sending out spirit fluctuations.

Yang Kai exhaled softly, withdrew his Spirit Body, and an overwhelming fatigue washed over him.

Tending to such an unevolved life was more taxing than battling a Saint Realm expert; it understood nothing, and Yang Kai’s every mood could completely sway its emotional ripples.

To prevent the Yang Clan from noticing anything, Yang Kai coaxed it like a child and indulged it, though the strain on his spirit was enormous.

Yet the situation was somewhat beyond Yang Kai’s expectations.

He had been pouring Yang Liquid partly to delay matters and prevent himself, An Ling'er, and others from being blood-sacrificed by the Yang Clan, and partly to see what the Divine Tree would become when it evolved.

Unexpectedly, the long-term input of Yang Liquid and Divine Sense pacification had made the Divine Tree dependent on and trusting of him.

Perhaps it mistook him for kin.

Just as some creatures become fond of the first being they see after birth.

The Divine Tree’s state now was much the same.

It was hard to say precisely what it meant, but it didn’t seem to be a bad thing.

After resting a good while, Yang Kai gradually recovered.

Following that bout of frolicking, the Divine Tree seemed exhausted; over the next few days when Yang Kai sent his Spirit Body into the trunk it showed no response and remained silent.

Only after five full days did it awaken.

This time its consciousness was a little clearer than before; it could romp with Yang Kai’s Spirit Body and convey some muddled messages.

Its transmissions were chaotic—Yang Kai couldn’t grasp what it meant; it was like a person talking to themselves, curious and exploratory about everything around it.

Yang Kai could only grin wryly and force himself to keep it company.

After all the fuss, he was mentally and physically drained.

Days passed; every day the Yang Clan came to observe and confirm Yang Kai wasn’t up to tricks and to note the Divine Tree’s changes, but they found nothing.

The Divine Tree would wake every few days, each time showing different changes; after playing with Yang Kai it would go back to sleep, seemingly carefree.

As time went on, the tree’s sleep cycles shortened—from five days to four, then three, two…

The messages coming from its consciousness gradually clarified, and Yang Kai realized the Divine Tree’s awareness was about to be fully born; his heart brimmed with endless expectation.
