## Chapter 312 — Any Requests?

Bilo had once considered the Fenghuan Tower, but despite her persistent efforts over several months, Shan Qingluo had never agreed.

However, now an unknown man was actually going to stay in the Fenghuan Tower, instantly shocking Bilo's heart.

Who is this kid? How could he attract such attention from the lady?

In her surprise, her beautiful eyes continuously scrutinized Yang Kai, filled with jealousy and discontent.

"You've traveled a long way and must be tired. Rest early today. Once I finish my business, I'll come find you to talk," Shan Qingluo said with a charming smile.

Yang Kai maintained a cold expression, giving her a glance without saying anything.

When under someone else's roof, one had to bow their head.

Just as Bilo was about to clap her hands and summon a few maidservants, Shan Qingluo said, "You personally take him to the Fenghuan Tower."

Bilo was taken aback, her expression growing even more astonished, and she nodded, "Understood!"

Shan Qingluo then gently reminded Yang Kai, "Don't bully her. Bilo has grown up under my watch and is like a sister to me."

"Got it," Yang Kai replied, somewhat annoyed.

"Go on!"

Bilo then led Yang Kai through the palace.

Following behind this enchanting young girl, Yang Kai observed that Shan Qingluo's palace was indeed tranquil. Although the outside was a bustling city, inside it was devoid of any noise, filled instead with fragrant aromas. Every path was meticulously cleaned.

From time to time, they encountered a few beautiful maidservants, all of whom respectfully greeted Bilo while curiously sizing up Yang Kai.

As they walked, he surprisingly did not encounter a single man.

Before long, they arrived at the Fenghuan Tower.

It was an elegant building with three stories, neither too large nor too small. It had a unique charm, with many flowers and plants planted in front, blooming beautifully in the season. The fragrance was overwhelming.

"Hey..." Bilo called out to Yang Kai while leading the way, "Be careful where you step, don’t trample on these flowers and plants. These were all personally planted by the lady herself. If you damage them, I won’t let you off!"

"Mm." Yang Kai replied indifferently, knowing that this little girl had some grievances against him, but he didn’t bother to argue with her.

What kind of person is this? Bilo secretly resented, thinking this kid didn’t seem like anyone important, and his attire and demeanor didn’t suggest a noble background. Why was the adult so concerned about him?

Moreover, the adult had previously instructed him not to bully her!

Could he even defeat her? Bilo was puzzled.

If it weren’t for Shan Qingluo treating Yang Kai with such high regard, Bilo would have been unable to resist challenging him to a duel to teach him a lesson.

They ascended to the second floor. Bilo opened the door and rushed in first, her pretty face revealing a joyful expression. She ignored Yang Kai and instead jumped onto a soft fragrant bed, lying there in a starfish position, hugging a pillow and sniffing it vigorously.

As she inhaled, a blissful expression appeared on her face.

This was the bed where the lady had slept, the fragrant pillow the lady had used. It still carried the adult's scent...

Bilo felt her spirit soaring, her cheeks turning rosy.

Yang Kai frowned at her, secretly amused. He realized that this little girl must have idolized Shan Qingluo, which explained her irrational behavior.

However, as she lay there, her posture accentuated her beautiful curves.

After taking a closer look at the room, Yang Kai nodded, "Not bad!"

Bilo instantly snapped awake, scrambling up from the fragrant bed, her eyes wide, and gritted her teeth, "Not bad?"

Yang Kai nodded as if it were a matter of course. This was a woman's boudoir, and it felt inappropriate for him to stay there. Giving it a "not bad" evaluation was already quite generous.

"Ha ha... it really is not bad!" Bilo bit her teeth, huffing angrily, "This is the place where the lady lived when she was a girl. I begged for a long time, and she wouldn’t let me move in. You, a nobody, can come in, and you’re not even satisfied, just saying it’s 'not bad'?"

"Uh..." Yang Kai looked at her in astonishment, finally understanding why she harbored such hostility toward him.

Scratching his nose, he awkwardly said, "Bilo, do you have some misunderstanding about me?"

"What are you even worth!" Bilo stood up angrily, holding the pillow, and stomped out.

"Why are you taking the pillow with you?" Yang Kai was speechless.

"This is the lady's!" Bilo turned around angrily, then stormed back, grabbing the bedding as well, "This is also the lady's!"

She shot Yang Kai a fierce glare before strutting away.

Yang Kai was taken aback, realizing that this woman’s admiration for Shan Qingluo was likely obsessive.

Not wanting to dwell on it, he directly jumped onto the bed and sat cross-legged.

He knew he couldn’t stay in Piaoxiang City for long. Shan Qingluo's cultivation method was too dangerous; if he stayed, he would eventually die at her hands.

But now that the enchantress had regained her strength, Yang Kai knew he couldn’t escape.

What a self-inflicted disaster; had he known, he wouldn’t have given her the Wan Yao Ling Paste! But at that time, he had no choice; it was like escaping from a tiger's den only to fall into a wolf's lair.

Moreover, the seal she had implanted in him was definitely for tracking purposes.

To leave, he first needed to resolve this seal.

Closing his eyes and concentrating, Yang Kai carefully examined his internal condition.

Although his Divine Sense could not peer inside, sensing his bodily condition was still easy.

After a while, Yang Kai felt a faint energy attached to his ribcage in his chest and abdomen, like a parasite.

He attempted to disperse it with True Yang Yuan Qi but was powerless.

The evil energy from his Proud Bone Golden Body couldn’t purify it either.

It was attached there, causing no harm to his body and not obstructing the flow of True Yuan, but this energy was like a bright beacon in the darkness; Shan Qingluo could easily sense his location.

If only the Earth Demon were here! He could analyze what kind of energy this was, but unfortunately, since the Earth Demon took over the demon body in the Dragon Confinement Ravine, there had been no news.

While he was struggling, Yang Kai suddenly sensed a wisp of Divine Sense drifting beside him.

"You little rascal, what are you doing?" Shan Qingluo's voice immediately followed, sounding both playful and reproachful.

"Sleeping!" Yang Kai rolled his eyes, cursing inwardly, realizing that the energy the enchantress had implanted in him was problematic. He hadn’t expected it to alert her.

Shan Qingluo chuckled, "Don’t bother trying. That’s a Soul Pursuit Seal; unless I personally dissolve it, even a peak expert in the Divine Roaming Realm cannot remove it. With this seal, no matter how far you escape, I can always find you!"

"Is it really necessary?" Yang Kai said with a bitter expression.

"Hehe..." Shan Qingluo laughed lightly, "Who told you to be so disobedient? If you had been honest, I wouldn’t treat you this way. Alright, you can rest for the night; I’ll come find you tomorrow, and I promise not to let you be bored."

"Forget it."

"You’re truly heartless!" Shan Qingluo huffed and withdrew her Divine Sense.

With no other choice, Yang Kai could only abandon the idea of shattering the Soul Pursuit Seal and rest peacefully for the night.

The next day.

Yang Kai was startled awake by footsteps coming from downstairs while he was meditating.

Not long after, there was a knock at the door.

"Come in!"

The door opened, and a graceful and voluptuous beauty entered, wearing a captivating smile.

This beauty appeared to be no older than twenty-five, her figure ample, and her peach blossom eyes seemed to radiate alluring spring light at all times. Her skin was fair and tender, exuding an extreme charm. Though she might not surpass Shan Qingluo, she was not far behind, radiating a ripe allure that made one want to squeeze her.

However, compared to Shan Qingluo, this woman was more overtly seductive, while Shan Qingluo was more delicate.

She smiled sweetly at Yang Kai, gently parting her lips to speak, "Did you rest well last night, Young Master?"

"Not bad!" Yang Kai nodded slightly.

The beauty stepped forward, approaching the bedside and performing a graceful bow, her breath fragrant as she said, "Just so you know, I am here to serve you on behalf of the lady. You can call me Yunli."

"And these two girls," the beauty introduced, waving her hand, and two young maidens with different temperaments stepped forward.

One appeared gentle and serene, while the other looked dignified and elegant.

Whether it was the beauty or the two maidens, they all possessed stunning looks, making them exceptionally pleasing to the eye.

"This is Ruoyu," the beauty pointed to the gentle maiden, then indicated the dignified one, "And this is Ruoqing!"

"Greetings, Young Master!" The two curtsied gracefully, their demeanor and attire comparable to those of noble ladies, leaving no room for criticism.

Yang Kai's face darkened, unsure of what Shan Qingluo intended with this arrangement. The three women had distinct temperaments, but each could easily evoke a man's desire to conquer.

Not to mention the two maidens, Ruoyu and Ruoqing; even this beauty, Yunli, was only slightly less charming than Shan Qingluo. Moreover, she had an advantage that the maidens did not possess: an extremely voluptuous figure and a pair of alluring peach blossom eyes that seemed to emit temptation at all times.

Was this meant to trap him in a world of softness? Yang Kai's heart raced.

Yunli smiled, "The lady said that during your stay in Piaoxiang City, all your daily needs and various matters will be taken care of by us."

"Thank you for your trouble," Yang Kai replied coolly.

"It’s our duty; you are the lady's esteemed guest," Yunli said with a smile, her face suddenly blushing slightly as she softly added, "The lady also said that any requests you have, we must fulfill!"

"Any requests?" Yang Kai's heart stirred, sensing the implications behind her words.

Yunli nodded gently, and even Ruoyu and Ruoqing became shy, their gazes drifting, unable to meet Yang Kai's eyes, their expressions slightly tense.
