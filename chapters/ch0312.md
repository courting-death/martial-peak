## Chapter 312 — Any Requests?

Bilo had once set her sights on Fenghuan Tower as well, but even after months of wheedling before Shan Qingluo, she never received consent.

Yet now, an obscure man was actually going to move into Fenghuan Tower. Bilo’s maiden heart was instantly flooded with shock.

What background does this brat have, to be valued so highly by my lady?

While astonished, her beautiful eyes kept sizing up Yang Kai, tinged with jealousy and dissatisfaction.

“You have traveled hard all the way. Rest early tonight. When I finish my matters, I will come speak with you,” Shan Qingluo said with a charming smile.

Yang Kai kept his expression cold, shot her a glance, and said nothing.

Under another’s eaves, one must bow their head.

Bilo was just about to clap and summon a few more maids when Shan Qingluo said, “You will personally take him to Fenghuan Tower.”

Bilo started, her expression growing even more surprised, then nodded. “Yes!”

Shan Qingluo softly admonished Yang Kai, “You little rascal, do not bully her. I watched Bilo grow up; she is like a sister to me.”

“Got it,” Yang Kai replied irritably.

“Go.”

Only then did Bilo lead Yang Kai through the palace residence.

Following behind this enchanting young girl, Yang Kai looked around as they walked and found Shan Qingluo’s palace to be truly tranquil. Though outside lay a prosperous city, not the slightest clamor reached here, and a delicate fragrance suffused every corner. Each path was spotless.

From time to time, they encountered pretty maids. All paid respectful salutes to Bilo and stared at Yang Kai with unabashed curiosity.

On the entire way, not a single man appeared.

Before long, they arrived at Fenghuan Tower.

It was an elegant three-story pavilion, neither large nor small, with its own unique charm. Many flowers and plants were planted before it, and it was the season of a hundred blossoms competing in beauty; their fragrance greeted the face.

“Hey…” Bilo led the way and called back to Yang Kai, “Watch your step. Do not tread on the flowers; these were personally planted by my lady long ago. If you damage them, I will not let you off!”

“Oh.” Yang Kai answered indifferently. He knew this girl bore a grudge against him and did not bother with her petulant tone.

What sort of person is he! Bilo fumed inwardly. This brat did not look formidable, and his attire and bearing hardly spoke of noble origins. Why would my lady care so much for him?

And my lady even warned him not to bully me!

Could he even beat me? Bilo sniffed disdainfully in her heart.

If not for Shan Qingluo treating Yang Kai with such high regard, Bilo would have already itched to spar with him and give him a sound lesson.

They went upstairs to the second floor. Bilo opened a room and slipped in first. Joy blossomed on her pretty face. Ignoring Yang Kai, she bounded straight onto the fragrant, soft bed, sprawling out spread-eagle and hugging a pillow in her arms, her delicate nose twitching as she sniffed with all her might.

As she inhaled, an expression of utter bliss surfaced on her face.

This was the bedding my lady slept on; this was the pillow my lady used. It still carries her scent…

Bilo felt her soul drifting, her cheeks flushing red.

Yang Kai frowned at her, secretly amused. He understood that this little girl must have placed Shan Qingluo on the highest pedestal in her heart, hence this unreasonable behavior.

Still, the way she lay there only made the youthful curves of her hips all the more pronounced.

Glancing over the boudoir, Yang Kai nodded. “Not bad.”

Bilo snapped awake and scrambled off the bed. Her almond eyes widened as she bit out, “Not bad?”

Yang Kai nodded matter-of-factly. This was a woman’s boudoir; he felt it ill-suited for a man to live in. Saying “not bad” was already generous.

“Heh… truly not bad!” Bilo bit her teeth and huffed. “This was my lady’s residence when she was still a maiden. I wheedled her for a long time, and she still would not let me move in. Yet you, a nobody whose origins are unknown, can walk right in, and you only think it’s not bad?”

“Uh…” Yang Kai stared at her in surprise and at last understood the source of her hostility.

He rubbed his nose, embarrassed. “Miss Bilo, perhaps there is some misunderstanding.”

“Who do you think you are!” Bilo snapped. Hugging the fragrant pillow, she stomped toward the door.

“Why are you taking the pillow?” Yang Kai was speechless.

“My lady used it.” Bilo turned back angrily, then marched back and lifted the beddings into her arms as well. “She used these too.”

She shot Yang Kai a fierce look like a little shopkeeper defending her treasures, then swept out proudly.

Yang Kai was taken aback and realized Bilo’s worship of Shan Qingluo had already reached a state of obsession.

He did not mind. He leaped upon the bed and sat cross-legged.

He could not tarry long in Piaoxiang City. The cultivation art Shan Qingluo practiced was far too fatal; if he stayed, sooner or later he would die beneath her.

But now that the enchantress had recovered her strength, he could not escape even if he wished to.

He had truly invited disaster upon himself. Had he known, he would never have given her Wan Yao Ling Paste. Yet at that time, there had been no other choice. One might say he had just escaped a tiger’s den only to fall into a wolf’s lair.

Moreover, the seal that enchantress had implanted in him earlier was certainly meant for tracking.

If he wished to leave, he would have to resolve that seal first.

Yang Kai closed his eyes and calmed his mind, carefully examining his body.

Though his Divine Sense could not achieve full inner vision, sensing his physical condition was easy.

After a short while, he found a faint strand of energy clinging to his ribs at the chest and abdomen, attached like a maggot to bone.

He tried to dispel it with True Yang Primordial Qi, but was unable.

Even the evil energy of the Proud Bone Golden Body could not purify it.

It clung there without harming his body or obstructing the flow of True Essence, yet this strand of energy was like a bright lighthouse in the dark—Shan Qingluo could effortlessly sense his position.

If only the Earth Demon were here! He could examine what this energy truly was. Unfortunately, since possessing that demon body beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine, there had been no news from him.

Just then, while Yang Kai was concentrating, he keenly sensed a wisp of Divine Sense drift to his side.

“Little rascal, what are you doing?” Shan Qingluo’s voice followed, half teasing, half pleased.

“Sleeping.” Yang Kai rolled his eyes. He cursed inwardly; he had known that energy she implanted was problematic, but he had not expected even this to alert her.

Shan Qingluo giggled. “Do not waste your strength. That is my Soul Pursuit Seal. Unless I personally dissolve it, even a master at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm cannot remove it. With that seal, no matter how far you run, I can find you.”

“Is that really necessary?” Yang Kai pulled a long face.

“Giggle…” Shan Qingluo laughed softly. “Who told you to be so unruly? If you were obedient, how would I treat you like this? Enough, make do with a night’s rest for now. I will come find you tomorrow; I promise you will not be bored.”

“Spare me.”

“You are truly cold and heartless!” Shan Qingluo huffed, and withdrew her Divine Sense.

Helpless, Yang Kai gave up on shattering the Soul Pursuit Seal and rested for the night.

The next day.

Footsteps from downstairs roused Yang Kai from meditation.

After a short while, a knock sounded at the door.

“Enter.”

The door opened, and a mature beauty of exquisite poise and full, voluptuous figure glided in, a soul-stealing smile on her face.

One could not tell her exact age, but she was certainly no more than twenty-five. Her curves were generous, and her peach-blossom eyes seemed ever filled with alluring allure. Her skin was fair and tender, her bearing utterly bewitching. Though not quite on Shan Qingluo’s level, she was not far behind—she exuded a ripe, intoxicating charm, the kind that seemed to spill over at a touch.

Compared to Shan Qingluo, however, this woman’s sensuality was more overt, while Shan Qingluo’s was more delicately tender.

She smiled at Yang Kai, parted her red lips, and spoke gently, “Young Master, did you rest well last night?”

“Acceptably,” Yang Kai nodded.

The beauty stepped forward, saluted gracefully by the bed, and breathed orchid-sweet words. “Young Master should know, this servant was sent by my lady to attend to you. You may call me Yunli.”

“And these two girls,” she continued, gesturing. At her beckon, two maidens stepped in from behind.

One appeared gentle and demure; the other, dignified and elegant.

No matter Yunli or the two girls, all three were stunning, pleasing to the eye.

“This is Ruoyu,” Yunli introduced the gentle one, then indicated the dignified, poised girl. “And this is Ruoqing.”

“Greetings, Young Master.” The two bowed gracefully. Their conduct, bearing, and attire could match the young ladies of great clans—flawless.

Yang Kai’s face darkened slightly. He did not know what that enchantress Shan Qingluo intended. The three had differing temperaments, yet any one of them could stir a man’s desire to conquer.

Not to mention the two young girls, Ruoyu and Ruoqing—this mature beauty Yunli was only a shade inferior to Shan Qingluo in bearing, and she had what maidens lacked: a voluptuous body. Her peach-blossom eyes, shimmering with allure, seemed to exude temptation at every moment.

Was she trying to drown him in a gentle trap? Yang Kai’s heart thumped uneasily.

Yunli smiled. “My lady said that during Young Master’s stay in Piaoxiang City, all daily needs and affairs shall be attended by us.”

“Then I must trouble you,” Yang Kai replied, neither warm nor cold.

“It is as it should be. Young Master is my lady’s honored guest.” Yunli’s smile deepened; a faint blush rose on her cheeks as she lowered her voice. “My lady also said that any request Young Master makes, we must satisfy.”

“Any request?” Yang Kai’s heart stirred; he tasted the meaning beneath her words.

Yunli nodded lightly. Even Ruoyu and Ruoqing flushed shyly, their eyes drifting, not daring to meet Yang Kai’s gaze, a hint of nervousness upon their faces.
