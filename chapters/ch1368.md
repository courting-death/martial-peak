## Chapter 1368 — Just a Misunderstanding

"Brother Wei!" Yang Kai chuckled and gave the man a slight salute; the arrivals were, to his surprise, among his few friends—Yingyue Hall's elite disciples, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er.

"Brother Yang, long time no see!" Wei Guchang replied with obvious delight.

"Indeed, it's been years since we last parted. I didn't expect Brother Wei and Miss Xuan'er to have both advanced to the Origin Returning Realm—congratulations," Yang Kai said sincerely.

After returning from the Flowing Flame Sandland, Wei Guchang and Xuan'er had entered seclusion to break through to the Origin Returning Realm; now, meeting again, both had indeed succeeded and reached that realm.

Moreover, judging from the aura they exuded and the fluctuations of Saint Yuan within their bodies, their cultivation at this realm had already stabilized. Otherwise, they would never have left the main headquarters of Yingyue Hall.

Daiyuan, who had said she would go into seclusion to attempt the Origin Returning Realm, had inexplicably shown no movement; thinking this, Yang Kai glanced at Daiyuan and found her hand in Xuan'er's, the two of them whispering together with intimate expressions. Daiyuan's face flushed as she snorted, while Xuan'er smiled, her bright eyes flicking toward Yang Kai.

No one seemed to pay the red-haired old man or the Haixin Sect disciples any heed; they were treated as if invisible.

The red-haired elder was naturally furious, but when he looked more closely at Wei Guchang and Xuan'er and recalled how Yang Kai had addressed them, his expression shifted; he clasped his fists solemnly and asked, "May I ask if you are Yingyue Hall's Wei Guchang?"

Wei Guchang inclined his head lightly. "Yes, it's Wei. What does senior wish to say?"

Although his generation and age were much lower than the red-haired elder's, his cultivation level made the difference clear. There was no need to be overly polite; his tone was cool and even.

"Not dare, not dare!" the red-haired elder cried out in alarm. Though Wei had only just advanced to the Origin Returning Realm, his name had long been famed across the Dark Star; in talent and speed of cultivation, others could not keep pace—these young prodigies famed north and south would be the future masters of Dark Star.

If one offended him now, it would surely lead to no good outcome.

Having learned the other's identity, the red-haired elder dared not act rashly. Seeing the intimate connection between the owner of Dragon Lair Mountain and Wei Guchang, he realized avenging his disciples was out of the question; swallowing that bitter pill felt unbearable, and it injured the Haixin Sect's dignity.

For a moment he hesitated, not knowing what to do.

At the same time, he cursed furiously in his heart. If that fool surnamed Hai hadn’t been blind and provoked such a person, how could he have ended up so constrained now? Had it been some ordinary cultivator from a small family or minor sect, with the other side killing first and him retaliating afterward, no one would have found fault with it.

But now revenge was impossible, and whether he could leave unscathed depended entirely on the other's will.

“Brother Yang, what’s going on here? Why are so many people gathered?” Wei Guchang shifted the topic and asked, “Is there going to be a fight? I just recently broke through and was worrying I’d have no chance to test my new strength. If there really is such an opportunity, why not let me have it?”

His domineering stance made the red-haired elder's face grow even more unpleasant.

"Heh heh," Yang Kai laughed. "Nothing major—just someone has their eye on my Dragon Lair Mountain and wants to requisition this place."

"Requisition?" Wei Guchang's brows rose; he sneered, "What big words. Who dares claim this priceless land? Speak up, then."

Though he said this, Wei's gaze pierced straight at the red-haired elder, his expression hostile.

The red-haired elder paled and, knowing how matters stood, quickly clasped his fists. "Nephew Wei, a misunderstanding—my junior spoke without thinking. It's nothing important, just a misunderstanding!"

He was someone who could bend and yield; he spoke calmly, showing no trace of resentment, as if he no longer cared about the earlier death of an Elite Disciple.

“A misunderstanding, you say?” Wei Guchang clearly had no intention of letting it go. Pointing at the mangled corpse on the ground, he said, “That’s quite the misunderstanding then — how come someone ended up dead here?”

The red-haired elder's eyes narrowed and his face twitched. He said, "Rest easy, Nephew Wei—this unseeing wretch deserved his fate. I will order men to clean this place so this precious land will not be sullied."

Wei Guchang's eyes narrowed as he stared at the red-haired elder, then after a long while gave a short laugh and turned to Yang Kai. "Brother Yang, what do you intend?"

"If it's a misunderstanding, then there's nothing more to say. But such misunderstandings should not recur—lest they bring about bloodshed next time," Yang Kai said, his smile strained and cold as he looked at the red-haired elder.

"Your words will be heeded; I will restrain my disciples," the red-haired elder said with a slight nod. Seeing that Wei Guchang and Yang Kai had no intention of pursuing the matter, he ordered his men to clean up the corpse and blood, clasped his fists once more, and led a dozen Haixin Sect disciples away.

Watching them leave, Wei Guchang frowned and warned, "Brother Yang, be careful—this man endures humiliation and is unlikely to let it go."

"I know. I'll meet force with force and deal with whatever comes," Yang Kai grinned, showing no concern.

“Brother Yang, I truly must apologize again,” Wei said earnestly. “It’s not that I intended to interfere with you, but you also know the current state of Yingyue Hall. If a clash here were to escalate into conflict between Yingyue Hall and the force behind this person, and other powers took the chance to exploit it, our Yingyue Hall would be in real trouble…”

"I know, Brother Wei, you needn't worry," Yang Kai said. He understood perfectly: had Wei not intervened, Yang Kai would have been free to slaughter; such action would invite a cascade of conflicts, and Yingyue Hall could not sit idle. Since Wei had stepped in, Yang Kai could not refuse to show him some face.

"Enough of this—please, come in," Yang Kai said with a laugh, waving as he lifted the barrier of Dragon Lair Mountain and led Wei Guchang and the others inside.

The moment they stepped within, rich Spiritual Qi wrapped them from all sides. Wei Guchang inhaled deeply, unable to stop praising, "Brother Yang, your Dragon Lair Mountain is extraordinary. The gathered Spiritual Qi here rivals some of Yingyue Hall's Earth Veins."

"You flatter me, Brother Wei. Dragon Lair Mountain is small and sparsely populated; it cannot compare to Yingyue Hall. Still, its Qi is more than sufficient for dozens to cultivate," Yang Kai replied.

"The scenery is lovely too. I've been telling Senior Brother that if we have the chance we should come stay a few days to unwind—it's just that I worry Senior Brother Yang might not welcome us," Xuan'er said, smiling demurely at the side.

"Ha!" Yang Kai laughed heartily. "Xuan'er, are you trying to flatter me? If you and the others come, how could I not welcome you? The gates of Dragon Lair Mountain are always open."

Xuan'er blushed and stuck out her delicate tongue, clearly embarrassed.

Just then, in the middle of the awkwardness, someone suddenly noticed an object and gave a small exclamation.

Wei Guchang raised his brows and looked in that direction, exclaiming in surprise, “Brother Yang, you actually have a Sentient Tree here?”

What they saw was the Yang attribute Divine Tree. Since Yang Kai had released it from the Black Book Space it had lived on Dragon Lair Mountain; though it had no limbs and its movement was limited, it would occasionally shift position when it pleased. At this moment it was moving—its roots coiled and uncoiled like oars, propelling it inch by inch forward.

On the Divine Tree's thick trunk there was a withered face; though aged, the features were clear.

This was clearly a sign that the Divine Tree had gained sentience.

It seemed to have heard their voices—the Divine Tree halted its movement and glanced their way. Its leaves rustled softly, and moments later, two vine-like branches extended downward from the tree, snaking through the air like tendrils toward Xuan’er and Daiyuan.

At the tip of each branch curled a golden, fragrant fruit. The withered face on the trunk seemed to smile, showing a kindly expression.

Xuan'er and Daiyuan exchanged surprised looks, then reached out and took the fruits, thanking the tree.

Yang Kai was equally astonished—this was the first time he had seen the Divine Tree behave in such a way. He was amazed and delighted: releasing it had clearly helped its spirit open more fully and aided its evolution.

After offering the two fruits, the Divine Tree resumed shifting forward.

Wei Guchang couldn’t help but laugh wryly. “So this Sentient Tree even distinguishes between men and women when giving gifts? Why do both of you girls get something, yet I alone get nothing?”

The group burst into laughter.

It was merely a small interlude. Though the Divine Tree’s fruit wasn’t anything extraordinary, it was the first time Xuan’er and Daiyuan had received such a special gift, so they naturally treasured it with great care.

Yang Kai led the group onward.

Outside, the Haixin Sect crowd led by the red-haired elder trudged away with faces ashen. They had expected their Senior Uncle to come and avenge the cultivator surnamed Hai, but instead had retreated in shame. Each of them felt a loss of face and the mood was heavy.

At that moment yet another Origin Returning Realm cultivator had stepped in front of them, and the red-haired elder was furious. He had feigned submission earlier before Wei Guchang, but who was this person now, silently blocking their path?

If he had not perceived a lack of hostile intent, the red-haired elder's wrath would have driven him to act at once.

"Friend, what business do you have? Why block us?" the red-haired elder asked through gritted teeth.

"Brother Cui, no need for alarm. I am a friend, not foe," the man said with a faint smile.

"You know my background?" The red-haired elder's face went cold and he grew wary when the man called out his surname.
