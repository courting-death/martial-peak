## Chapter 2396 — Ancestor Bing Yun

Following behind Fan Xin, Yang Kai asked, "Junior Sister Fan Xin, why does the Pavilion Master want to see me?"

Fan Xin smiled and said, "I dare not ask about Master’s affairs."

She was only following orders and had no idea why the Ice Heart Pavilion Master wanted to see Yang Kai. After a pause, she added, "But Master rarely meets outsiders. Even we disciples haven’t seen her in a long time."

As she spoke, a trace of gloom appeared on her face, along with a hint of envy, as if she envied that Yang Kai, an outsider, had the fortune to be summoned by Master.

"When you see Master later, don’t look where you shouldn’t, don’t say what you shouldn’t. If you anger her, no one on this island can save you," Fan Xin warned uneasily, afraid Yang Kai might be disrespectful before her Master.

"I understand," Yang Kai replied solemnly. But after Fan Xin’s warning, he couldn’t help feeling nervous. He had a vague sense that the Ice Heart Pavilion Master was not an easy person to get along with—most likely a cranky old woman.

"By the way, my Junior Sister these past few days..." Yang Kai suddenly thought of Liu Qianyun. Ever since she’d taken refuge in Ice Heart Pavilion, he hadn’t seen her and wondered how she was doing.

Fan Xin said, "You can rest assured about Junior Sister Liu. She’s gentle by nature and gets along well with us sisters. She even volunteered to help out, so I let her do some chores in the Pavilion."

"That’s good," Yang Kai breathed a sigh of relief. Liu Qianyun wasn’t the type to cause trouble, so he didn’t need to worry about her.

As they spoke, the two of them arrived at the sixth floor of Ice Heart Pavilion. Just as Yang Kai had guessed, the mysterious and powerful Pavilion Master resided on this very floor.

Standing before the door, Fan Xin said, "Pillmaster Yang, you can go in yourself. Master is waiting for you inside."

"Thank you!" Yang Kai nodded slightly and pushed the door open to enter.

As Yang Kai stepped onto the sixth floor, he barely had time to take in his surroundings before the door behind him swung shut with a clatter. Unfazed, he calmly glanced around, his expression composed as he surveyed the room.

The sixth floor wasn’t very large, but every detail of its furnishings exuded a lively aura, as if these inanimate objects had their own life, making one feel inexplicably at ease and happy.

Yang Kai was secretly amazed as he walked further in. The decorations were simple yet elegant, and a natural fragrance drifted through the air, giving him the illusion of stepping into a young maiden’s boudoir.

"Are you the new Pillmaster?" Suddenly, a melodious voice sounded from the side. The voice was crisp and gentle, yet carried a tranquil calmness, utterly untouched by the mundane world, as if it had drifted down from the heavens, ethereal and elusive.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. He quickly turned toward the source of the voice.

He hadn’t noticed anyone nearby at first, but then heard a voice. Clearly, the speaker’s cultivation far surpassed his own, making her presence undetectable to him.

If this person had harbored ill intent, he would have already fallen victim. Realizing this, cold sweat broke out on Yang Kai’s back.

Looking over, Yang Kai saw a young woman in palace attire standing quietly. Her expression was calm as she gazed at him. Like her voice, she exuded a lively aura, as if she were a blooming white lotus, untouched by the slightest speck of dust.

Yang Kai’s first impression of her was one of utter purity—so pure it was like a crystal-clear lake, untouched by even the slightest speck of dust. He could hardly believe it; that such a flawless, immaculate woman could exist in this world seemed almost impossible.

Then, Yang Kai felt a sense of familiarity.

It wasn’t just the pure aura that felt familiar, but also her appearance. He felt as if he’d seen her somewhere before—a distant memory flashed through his mind, but he couldn’t recall when or where.

Seeing Yang Kai staring blankly at her, lost in a daze, the young woman’s beautiful brows furrowed slightly. She raised her hand, intending to teach him a lesson.

She knew well the impact her appearance had on men. Since she began cultivating, she’d seen this scene countless times and knew what filthy thoughts men harbored when they looked at her.

She assumed Yang Kai was the same.

But she quickly realized something was off. Though Yang Kai stared at her without blinking, there was no disrespect in his eyes—only amazement, nostalgia, and puzzlement.

Amazement she could understand, but what about the nostalgia and puzzlement? The young woman clearly saw confusion in Yang Kai’s eyes, as if he were wondering about something and reminiscing about someone, his expression extremely gentle.

She quietly lowered her raised jade hand and let out a heavy humph.

Yang Kai snapped out of his daze, his face flushing red. Realizing how rude it was to stare so intently, especially since this person was likely the Pavilion Master, cold sweat beaded on his forehead. He bowed and said, "Yes, may I ask, Senior... are you the Pavilion Master?"

He still couldn’t believe that such a pure, flawless young woman was the master of Ice Heart Pavilion. He’d thought she would be a cranky old woman! The contrast was simply too great.

"I am," the young woman nodded lightly.

"Junior Yang Kai greets Senior. If I have been disrespectful, I beg your pardon," Yang Kai said hurriedly.

The young woman remained silent, but seeing Yang Kai admit his mistake so promptly, she decided not to pursue the matter. If she’d truly wanted to punish him, she could have done so a moment ago.

"Who were you thinking of just now?" After a moment, the young woman asked.

Without raising his head, Yang Kai replied, "I was thinking of my wife."

The young woman said indifferently, "Oh? Does my appearance resemble your wife’s?" Otherwise, why would Yang Kai think of his wife upon seeing her?

Her tone was calm, betraying no hint of emotion, yet Yang Kai felt as if a mountain weighed upon him. Wiping the cold sweat from his brow, he answered cautiously, "You don’t really look alike, but your auras are very similar—both incredibly pure, untouched by the slightest speck of dust. And..." Yang Kai grinned, "Just like you, she’s always so cold and aloof—like an ice doll."

Speaking of Su Yan, Yang Kai’s expression softened, a smile of reminiscence appearing on his face, his heart filled with sweetness.

"Ice doll..." The young woman seemed amused by the description, the corners of her mouth involuntarily lifting.

"Ah!" Yang Kai suddenly cried out, abruptly looking up at the young woman, his eyes trembling violently in disbelief.

"What is it?" The young woman frowned, extremely displeased by Yang Kai’s startled reaction. He’d once again raised his head to stare at her so rudely, and his expression was as if he’d seen a ghost, which annoyed her even more.

"Senior..." Yang Kai swallowed nervously, "I have a question for you. Would you be willing to answer?"

The young woman replied impatiently, "Ask."

Yang Kai hesitated, searching for the right words. After a while, he gritted his teeth and said, "May I ask, Senior, is your name Bing Yun?"

The young woman’s brows knitted, her voice cold. "How do you know that?"

None of her disciples would have told Yang Kai her name, and no one else on Tongtian Island knew it. How had Yang Kai learned her name?

Yang Kai didn’t answer. Instead, he grew even more excited, stepped forward, and asked in a low voice, "Did you found Ice Heart Valley? Did you leave behind the Profound Frost Divine Sword?"

Bing Yun’s eyes widened in surprise. "You even know that? Could it be you’re from the Northern Territory?"

"Northern Territory?" Yang Kai frowned and slowly shook his head. "I’m from the Southern Territory. I’ve never been to the Northern Territory."

Bing Yun asked curiously, "If you’ve never been to the Northern Territory, how do you know my name and Ice Heart Valley? No, even if you’d been to the Northern Territory and seen my statue, and knew my name and its connection to the Valley, you couldn’t possibly know about the Profound Frost Divine Sword. I left that sword behind long ago!"

After a pause, Bing Yun exclaimed, "Could it be that you..."

Yang Kai grinned foolishly, his whole body relaxing.

Bing Yun, too, rarely showed a smile, and said softly, "Are you from the Hengluo Star Domain?"

Yang Kai scratched his head. "Hengluo Star Domain? I don’t actually know the name of my home star domain, but there is a powerful Hengluo Commerce Guild there."

"Is there also a Sword Alliance, Purple Star, and Spine of the Star River?" Bing Yun asked.

"Yes, yes, yes," Yang Kai nodded repeatedly.

Bing Yun laughed, "So you really are from the Hengluo Star Domain. I never thought that after so many years, I’d meet someone from my homeland here."

"I never thought I’d meet Senior Bing Yun here either," Yang Kai said, his face full of amazement and emotion.

The moment he saw Bing Yun, Yang Kai had felt she looked familiar, as if he’d seen her somewhere before, but couldn’t recall where. Only when he remembered Su Yan did the long-buried memory surface.

He had indeed seen Bing Yun before, but not in person—he’d seen a statue!

Back then, when Su Yan was taken away by the people of Ice Heart Valley from Chi Lan Star, she spent many years cultivating within the Valley. When Yang Kai went to Ice Heart Valley in search of Su Yan, he had seen a statue of Bing Yun there.

Bing Yun was the founding ancestor of Ice Heart Valley, but her fate was unknown. At that time, the Valley Lord, Bing Long, had told Yang Kai that Ancestor Bing Yun had likely left that world for a broader sky, leaving behind her Profound Frost Divine Sword as the Ancestral Treasure.

Later, Su Yan inherited the Profound Frost Divine Sword.

By now, it had been tens of thousands of years since Bing Yun founded Ice Heart Valley.

Who could have imagined she was still alive, had come to the Star Domain, and had even cultivated to the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm?
