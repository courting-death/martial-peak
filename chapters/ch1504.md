## Chapter 1504 — Departure

Crack, crack, crack…

The sandstorm guarding the outermost perimeter collapsed at a touch; the Purple Shield reappeared, its glow dim and its spirituality greatly lost, yet those arcs of lightning showed no sign of waning and once more lashed toward the great net woven from the Golden Blood Threads.

Golden light blazed as thunder serpents danced; the Golden Blood Threads also suddenly dimmed, and Yang Kai spat a mouthful of fresh blood, his face turning pale.

The Golden Blood Threads are an existence between secret art and Secret Treasure, linked to the cultivator’s mind and spirit. When the Golden Blood Threads are wounded, Yang Kai also suffers—this is the only drawback of the Golden Blood Threads secret art.

At this moment, Yang Kai indeed took a small loss.

Fortunately, the flaws did not overshadow the brilliance of the Golden Blood Threads. Incomparably powerful, the great net woven from them blocked those invincible arcs of lightning and finally dispelled much of them, and what remained had its might greatly reduced.

They then slammed into the protection manifested by the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

A clear birdsong rang out as flames surged skyward. The scorching heat twisted the space within a hundred zhang around. The raging flames and arcs of lightning clashed in a fierce tug-of-war around Yang Kai’s body—advancing and retreating, surging and colliding in a desperate struggle.

However, Yang Kai’s expression was incomparably gloomy.

As the master of the Artifact Spirit, he could naturally feel the pressure the Artifact Spirit was bearing.

It could not hold!

If he acted willfully and let it continue to block, the Artifact Spirit would very likely have its soul scattered and perish here, disappearing between Heaven and Earth.

What kind of Secret Treasure is that bead, exactly? For it to possess such terrifying power—and why does a force of Imperial Might emanate from within it?

In just a short moment, the protection formed by the Artifact Spirit was already on the verge of shattering; the sky-filling blaze seemed doused with cold water and gradually was extinguished, and even its cry was clearly no longer as loud as before.

Yang Kai clenched his teeth and withdrew the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird.

He did not wish for the Artifact Spirit to fall here.

A streak of red light shot into Yang Kai’s body. Without the Fire Bird’s protection, Yang Kai’s figure was immediately exposed to the assault of countless arcs of lightning. They bounced and crackled like the sharpest blades, stabbing toward him.

Yang Kai’s face was ashen; at this point, he could only urge his Saint Yuan to guard himself.

“Yang Kai, this old man will aid you!” Fei Zhi Tu’s voice suddenly came from the side. He grinned; no one knew what secret art he used, but the power that had been sealed actually returned, and then he summoned the Blue Jade Bowl.

A ghostly blue radiance swarmed out from the bowl like moonlight pouring down, condensing into a mass as dense as substance and blocking the front.

A sizzling clamor arose. Those dancing arcs of lightning stabbed into the ghostly blue light, and the azure glow quickly dimmed.

In no more than three breaths, Fei Zhi Tu spat a mouthful of dark-red fresh blood. His face turned as pale as paper, his aura withered to the extreme.

And the Blue Jade Bowl he most relied upon even let out crisp sounds, fissuring with thread-thin cracks before collapsing to pieces and scattering all over the ground.

This powerful Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure was actually destroyed by those arcs of lightning in a single exchange!

This added insult to injury for Fei Zhi Tu even more!

“Old Fei!” Qian Tong’s face changed drastically; he looked over at him in alarm. Fei Zhi Tu slowly shook his head, not even having the strength to speak. He had already suffered grievous wounds when he was captured; later he was pierced through by Qu Zheng’s short spear; now the Secret Treasure linked to his mind and spirit was destroyed—he was already at the point of oil exhausted and lamp guttering.

However, his sacrifice was not in vain. After the obstruction of the Blue Jade Bowl, those arcs of lightning were far inferior to before. Though still powerful, Yang Kai no longer felt a mortal threat from them.

Zzzt, zzzt, zzzt…

The leaping arcs of lightning were like steel needles, boring into Yang Kai’s body and perforating him with countless tiny holes as fresh blood flowed freely.

Yang Kai drew a deep breath; Saint Yuan surged forth in abundance, shrouding Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu both. His face dark, he looked toward the ground below.

Everyone’s eyelids twitched wildly. They asked themselves that under such a berserk assault, they would absolutely have no way to cling to life, yet Yang Kai had done it. Despite Fei Zhi Tu’s desperate assistance, he had taken the remaining attack head-on, and his aura did not diminish; on the contrary, it grew madder.

Was he still human? Was he truly only at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm?

Fang Peng and Qu Zheng were stupefied, and that white-haired elder’s face was also filled with dread.

“Yang Kai, leave this place first, Old Fei, he…” Qian Tong shouted anxiously.

Yang Kai’s frenzied aura suddenly stalled, as if he came back to his senses. He gave a small nod, bit through the tip of his tongue, and spat out a single drop of Golden Blood. That blood quivered lightly and then sank into the Void, vanishing to who knows where.

Immediately, an extremely strange fluctuation of power undulated in front of Yang Kai, and a slender fissure suddenly appeared.

At first, that fissure was barely perceptible, but very soon it expanded, as though two invisible giant hands were tearing it open to either side.

Within the crack was pitch-black, chaotic, and void, as if it could devour everything.

“Impossible!” Mo Xiaosheng’s eyes trembled violently as he cried out, “Impossible, absolutely impossible—this cannot be a spatial rift!”

“What?” Fang Peng was greatly shocked. “A spatial rift?”

He was stunned, Qu Zheng was stunned, everyone was stunned. They stared blankly at that fissure spanning the Void, almost not daring to believe their eyes. They sent their Divine Sense inside to probe, but could not sense a thing.

Only Yang Kai stood tall before the rift, shielding Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu. His cold gaze swept across the enemies, his expression venomous as he declared in a low, resonant voice: “Today’s humiliation—this Sect Master will carve it into his very bones and entrails. In days to come, I shall return it a hundredfold!”

His chilling voice was like a wind blowing from the Nine Nether Purgatory, making people cold from head to toe.

As his words fell, his figure blurred, and he plunged into that spatial rift!

“Stop him!” The white-haired elder was the first to recover from the shock and roared hoarsely.

But by then, where was there any trace of Yang Kai? The attacks everyone sent out by reflex plunged into the spatial rift like stones sinking into the sea, without raising the slightest ripple.

After a single breath, that spatial rift closed on its own and vanished without a trace.

Everyone’s faces were iron-blue, their expressions shifting.

“This is impossible! Absolutely impossible!” In front of the silent palace, only Mo Xiaosheng’s muttering echoed.

To be struck down in the field he prided himself on most—Mo Xiaosheng’s arrogance was torn to shreds.

Qu Zheng and Fang Peng exchanged a glance and saw dread and regret in each other’s eyes. Qu Zheng turned his head to look at Mo Xiaosheng and said in a deep voice, “Great Elder, you did not mistake it—that was a spatial rift?”

“Heh heh…” Mo Xiaosheng’s eyes were vacant, his smile desolate. He answered upon hearing this, “This old man would rather have seen wrong, but that thing could only have been a spatial rift! He can actually rend space—at such a young age, he can cultivate Spatial Force to such a degree? It is over; this is over. On the entire Dark Star, I fear no one will be able to keep him. If he wishes to leave, no one will be able to stop him. Before he was merely toying with us!”

“No one can keep him?” Qu Zheng’s face turned ugly.

Mo Xiaosheng slowly shook his head, looking lost in soul. “Alliance Master, you do not understand how troublesome those who have cultivated Spatial Force are. This old man understands… Since we failed to kill him this time, we will never have another chance.”

Qu Zheng’s brows knit into a tight knot.

Recalling Yang Kai’s threat before leaving, his heart thumped in unease as well.

Lingxiao Sect is now deep within the Flowing Flame Sandland, where no one can invade. Yang Kai himself is so troublesome, and he can even rend space and flee. Having offended him this time, the days to come will likely be anything but peaceful!

“Elder Bai, what do you think…” Fang Peng had remained silent at the side until now. Only then did he turn to the white-haired elder in the brown long robe, his face full of inquiry.

That elder’s aura was also withered at this moment; it seemed that employing that bead-like Secret Treasure had forced him to pay a huge price. Hearing this, he snorted coldly: “Even the Extinction Thunder Bead could not keep him. This matter is no longer something this old man can handle. I will return to the mountain and report to the Sect Master; let the old man decide. Farewell.”

After saying this, he ignored what the others thought in the slightest, summoned a Star Shuttle, and fled far away at once.

Fang Peng did not even manage to utter a word to detain him; he could only glare resentfully in the direction of the man’s disappearance, and after a long time, curse hatefully.

The reason he and Qu Zheng had offended Yang Kai this time was nothing more than the order from the Star Emperor Mountain. For this they paid a heavy price, yet at such a moment others wanted to wash their hands of it.

What was that supposed to be? Dismantling the bridge after crossing the river, or cooking the hound when the rabbit is dead?

Without gaining a single benefit and for nothing provoking a troublesome enemy, Fang Peng was so angry he could spit blood.

However, the moment he thought of Qu Zheng, his mood lifted considerably. Though the Leitai Sect had suffered losses this time, Fang Tianzhong was unharmed—unlike the Battle Sky Alliance, which had lost even its Young Alliance Master, Qu Changfeng, in this place.

“Brother Qu, matters have come to this—Fang will also take his leave.” Fang Peng lightly coughed.

“Brother Fang wants to just walk away?” Qu Zheng lifted his eyelids and looked at him with a sinister gaze.

Fang Peng gave a dry laugh: “Brother Qu, you heard what that brat said before he left. He will absolutely not let today’s matter rest. Fang intends to return early to make some arrangements, then go into seclusion for several dozen years. No matter how formidable that brat is, he will not come strike at my Leitai Sect’s headquarters, right? If he really does, then he is far too overestimating himself. Brother Qu, I advise you to return and make arrangements as well. Order your disciples not to go out for no reason for the time being, so as not to be broken one by one by him; wait until the storm passes to speak further.”

“Is that all the courage Brother Fang has? To be frightened by a bout of intimidation and become a turtle shrinking into its shell?” Qu Zheng’s face was full of disdain.

“Listen to yourself…” Fang Peng curled his lips. “This Fang is merely avoiding weaknesses and playing to strengths. He himself has the Star Emperor Mountain to handle him; I do not intend to worry over this idle matter.”

“Hmph! If I do not avenge my son’s death, I swear I am no man! Brother Fang, go be that turtle shrinking into its shell if you like. I and he are irreconcilable. If he really dares to bully his way to my headquarters, I will make sure he never returns!” Qu Zheng growled in a low voice, his face ferocious.

“Then I wish Brother Qu may see his wish fulfilled soon and achieve victory with ease!” Fang Peng cupped his fists slightly, then waved his hand and swiftly departed with the remaining members of the Leitai Sect.

“Cowardly wretch!” Qu Zheng spat disdainfully in the direction Fang Peng had departed. Yet soon after, grief washed over his features. Looking toward a certain spot, he said with deep sorrow, “Bring the Young Alliance Master’s body. We’re returning.”

“Yes!” Someone immediately went over there and lifted up Qu Changfeng’s headless corpse, then transformed into a long rainbow and followed behind Qu Zheng, growing more and more distant.
