## Chapter 1347 — Spatial Array Gate

Fei Zhi Tu chuckled softly, his attitude becoming much more amiable as he explained, “It’s understandable that you wouldn’t know. The truth is, Ancient Divine Spirits are especially fond of devouring Heaven and Earth Spirits of the same attribute. After doing so, it greatly benefits them. From what I can see, that Ice Phoenix remnant soul of yours is extremely weak and must be in urgent need of this Heaven and Earth Spirit to restore its strength. Ancient Divine Spirits and Heaven and Earth Spirits are natural enemies by their very nature! But don’t worry—since that Ice Phoenix remnant soul belongs to you, after it finishes devouring the Heaven and Earth Spirit here, it will naturally return.”

"I see!" Yang Kai kept his expression calm, but inwardly he was extremely anxious.

Others might not know the situation, but he did — the Phoenix Empress's legacy was merely using his body as a vessel and was only resting temporarily; it did not truly belong to him. Had he not possessed the Dragon Emperor legacy, the Phoenix Empress inheritance would not have left the Tongxuan Continent with him and would likely still be sealed within the Phoenix Nest.

Of course Yang Kai would not expose this; hearts are inscrutable, and if these people learned the Ice Phoenix did not truly belong to him, who knew what ill intentions might arise.

Still, from this incident Yang Kai understood that within the Dragon-Phoenix Palace's Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress legacies there actually lay the remnant soul of an Ancient Divine Spirit — no wonder they wielded such might. This also explained why the two tattoo patterns seemed almost alive, constantly crawling over his skin.

The Heaven and Earth Spirit born inside the Ice Path attempted to devour everyone's vitality but, meeting its natural enemy, panicked and fled. As a result the heavy weight pressing on everyone's chests vanished in an instant and the crisis was dispelled. With the double protections of the Artifact Spirit and the Li Fire Shield there was no longer worry about the cold; they quickened their pace and rushed toward the end of the Ice Path.

Only halfway there Yang Kai noticed the frigid chill rapidly converging toward one direction, and the terrifying cold that had been oppressive greatly eased in a short span.

A moment later the strange commotion faded; at the edge of his vision a magnificent, noble figure appeared leisurely and charged straight toward them.

Yang Kai's face lit up — the Ice Phoenix remnant soul had indeed returned.

Though he had been worried, he had some confidence the spirit would not leave lightly — after all it counted as a Phoenix Empress legacy, and with the Dragon Emperor legacy in his body there was a certain resonance and pull.

For so many years it had used its own body as a vessel and slept until now; there was no reason it would simply abandon the place.

A flash of brilliance and the great form of the Ice Phoenix hovered above them, its noble, chill-filled phoenix eyes fixed below; no one dared draw breath.

A flicker of oddity passed through Yang Kai's eyes. He whispered, "Lord Fei, please open a slit in the Li Fire Shield."

"Oh." Fei Zhi Tu hurriedly nodded. With a thought the Li Fire Shield split open a seam, and at the same time the protective form taken by the Artifact Spirit, the Fire Bird, likewise opened a gap.

The Ice Phoenix flickered and became white light, plunging into Yang Kai's body and disappearing.

Although everyone was curious whether the Ice Phoenix had devoured that Heaven and Earth Spirit, no one asked at the moment — the priority was to exit the Ice Path quickly.

Fortunately the end was not far; after only a few dozen breaths they safely stepped into a palace, and only then did the lingering chill finally vanish.

Fei Zhi Tu turned his head to glance at Yang Kai. Seeing his brows tightly furrowed, as if he were examining himself, Fei Zhi Tu didn’t disturb him and merely said, “You all rest here for now. I’ll go look for the secret marks Old Qian left behind—once I find them, I’ll let you know.”

Saying that, he strode off to one side.

The others, upon hearing his words, each found places to sit cross-legged and recuperate. Though they had not exerted much while traversing the Ice Path, they had been badly frightened; if not for the Ice Phoenix remnant soul appearing at the last moment the consequences would have been dreadful. While resisting the cold and that Heaven and Earth Spirit's attack they had expended some strength, so they now hurried to recover.

Yang Kai sat silently to one side, sensing the state within his body.

Although the Phoenix Empress inheritance did not truly belong to him, since it existed within him he could probe a little. To his surprise the Ice Phoenix remnant soul did not seem to have gained much nourishment; although it felt somewhat stronger than before, clearly it was not because it had devoured the Heaven and Earth Spirit.

It had failed to devour that Heaven and Earth Spirit! Yang Kai immediately judged; only after absorbing the bitter cold energy of that place had it shown this change.

The result did not surprise Yang Kai: first, the Ice Phoenix remnant soul was not especially strong — it was merely an inheritance and could not exert great effect in his hands. Only if passed to Su Yan, and as Su Yan's strength rose, would its power be realized.

Second, that ice-type Heaven and Earth Spirit, having been born within the Ice Path, was undoubtedly supremely familiar with the environment there; evading the Ice Phoenix would not be difficult for it.

What a pity! Yang Kai sighed faintly — if the Ice Phoenix remnant had truly devoured that Heaven and Earth Spirit, unforeseen changes might have occurred, and handing it to Su Yan then would have brought her greater benefit.

Yang Kai had no intention of going back to trouble that Heaven and Earth Spirit. Though the Ice Phoenix was its natural nemesis, Yang Kai simply couldn’t command it. Besides, even a rabbit will bite when cornered—judging by that Heaven and Earth Spirit’s power, if he truly provoked it, it was hard to say who would end up victorious.

While they meditated, others kept glancing toward Yang Kai now and then, each eye reflecting deep envy; even the taciturn, ever-stony-faced Lian Guang was no exception.

Yang Kai pretended ignorance and continued to meditate and recover. How they regarded him was none of his concern, so long as they did not draw trouble upon him.

"Alright, I found the secret mark Elder Qian left — follow me!" Fei Zhi Tu's voice suddenly rang out; hearing this the group rose and assembled toward him.

The hall itself was not large; beyond its doors lay a maze-like expanse, branching and crisscrossing, each path leading who knew where, making one's head ache just looking at it.

Standing at the maze entrance the group exchanged looks, unsure how to proceed.

Fei Zhi Tu strode boldly in; seeing this everyone had no choice but to lower their heads and follow.

As they went Fei Zhi Tu explained, "Although Elder Qian's transmitted information left some matters unclear, this maze was mentioned. There are no forbidden formations inside, only mechanisms!"

"Mechanisms?" Ning Xiangchen's face showed surprise.

"Indeed, mechanisms!" Fei Zhi Tu lightly nodded. "But don't underestimate them; if you inadvertently trigger one or two, any of us might be lost here!"

Ning Xiangchen and the others' expressions shifted.

As they spoke a few forks suddenly appeared; Fei Zhi Tu stood at the junction and looked back at Lian Guang, "Lian boy, it's on you."

Lian Guang said nothing, waved his hand, and suddenly several mouse-like puppets appeared on the ground. Under Lian Guang's control they split toward the forks and in the blink of an eye disappeared from sight.

Yang Kai brightened — now he understood why Fei Zhi Tu had brought Lian Guang, a Saint King Realm, along: to use his puppets to scout.

It was a clever tactic; there were places warriors could not safely enter, but Lian Guang's puppets had no such concerns — even if lost, it caused him no harm.

After the mouse-like puppets vanished, Lian Guang closed his eyes as if sensing. A moment later a chorus of squeaks came from the left passage, and Lian Guang's face twitched faintly, revealing a hint of pain.

From the sounds it seemed the left passage was very perilous — that puppet was probably ruined.

After a while a faint sound came from the front passage; Lian Guang opened his eyes and said, "Right!"

Fei Zhi Tu nodded and took the lead to the right.

Having Lian Guang's puppets scout made everything much safer. Those rat-like puppets were of little use in battle but unrivaled for reconnaissance. After sacrificing twenty or thirty of them, the group passed through the maze without incident and met no danger along the way.

Lian Guang's face was ashen to the extreme; even a blind man could see his distress.

Though crafting those puppets wasn’t especially complex, the material cost for each was considerable. Producing those twenty or thirty rodent-type puppets had completely exhausted the stockpile Lian Guang had built up over the years.

It would be strange if he were in good spirits.

"Don't worry — once we return there'll be rewards for you," Fei Zhi Tu comforted.

With that promise Lian Guang's expression improved considerably.

"Brother Fei, that's aside for now; which way should we go?" Ning Xiangchen frowned and stared ahead.

Fei Zhi Tu heard this, turned, and froze.

After passing the maze two arched circular gates appeared ahead, one white and one black. The white seemed fashioned from white jade, the black bristled with sinister yin energy — the contrast striking.

Beyond the two arched gates lay a void of chaos; probing with Divine Sense found nothing, and the surface looked like a lake, unfathomably deep.

"Spatial Array Gate?" Fei Zhi Tu cried out in surprise.

"What — Elder Qian didn't tell you which gate to take?" Ning Xiangchen asked in astonishment. If such a detail had been in Qian Tong's message, Fei Zhi Tu wouldn't react like this; the only explanation was that Fei Zhi Tu also did not know.

"He didn't mention it!" Fei Zhi Tu slowly shook his head.

"How could that be? How could Elder Qian omit something so important?" Ning Xiangchen exclaimed.

"Elder Qian's message was sent in haste; it's normal that some things weren't mentioned," Fei Zhi Tu frowned and turned to Cai He and Du Sisi, asking, "Can you two decipher it?"
