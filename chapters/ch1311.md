## Chapter 1311 — Other Requests

Hearing his explanation, a keen light flashed in Yang Kai's eyes and he chuckled, "Brother Shen Fanlei asking me to accompany him shows he thinks highly of me—how could I blame you? Besides, I'm rather interested in this place myself."

"Brother Yang Kai..." Shen Fanlei stared at him in astonishment.

Yang Kai grinned: "Brother Shen Fanlei, you misunderstand. I'm only somewhat curious about their Dual Cultivation Technique that can help people break through bottlenecks. However, if it really works like that, then such a Dual Cultivation Technique is extraordinarily powerful. You must understand, the greatest obstacle in our cultivation is often the bottleneck; a single bottleneck can waste a lifetime. If this Dual Cultivation Technique truly works, it could be the very foundation for a Sect to establish itself—there would be no need to operate a Hehuan House here."

"So you mean..." Shen Fanlei, though not scheming, wasn't stupid; he picked up on the implication in Yang Kai's words.

Yang Kai's expression grew serious as he looked at him: "Could there be hidden dangers in using Dual Cultivation to break through bottlenecks?"

"I don't know—my Senior Brother never told me," Shen Fanlei frowned; Yang Kai's words put him on alert. Thinking it over, he realized the point: if a bottleneck could be broken through by a single Dual Cultivation session, wouldn't that be too simple?

Yang Kai paused and then explained his understanding of Dual Cultivation Technique: "I don't know whether Brother Shen has encountered such techniques before, but most Dual Cultivation Techniques in the world are extreme—either consuming yin to supplement yang or consuming yang to supplement yin. Dual cultivation usually benefits one side more than the other. Since this Hehuan House can exist here, I imagine the women cultivate not by supplementing yang with yin but by using a method similar to the former—sacrificing their own original yin or Yuan Qi to help clients advance their cultivation and break their shackles." Even if Shen Fanlei had never practiced dual cultivation, he had likely heard of such things.

Yang Kai himself had practiced dual cultivation, so he naturally had more to say on the subject.

"If that's the case, there may indeed be risks," Shen Fanlei mused. "If I don't have a specific method to temper the other party's incoming original yin or Yuan Qi, then even if my cultivation temporarily increases and I break a bottleneck, my root could still be unstable." He murmured, "But if that's so, why would my Senior Brother have mentioned such a place? If he hadn't suddenly left, I thought he would have brought me here."

"Maybe Brother Wang spoke casually and you misunderstood," Yang Kai said offhand.

"I see!" Shen Fanlei nodded. "Then what am I to do? Given this risk, I can't stick to my original plan. I'd rather spend more time in secluded cultivation than let one bout of dual cultivation ruin my foundation—especially with women I don't know."

Clearing his head, Shen Fanlei recovered his usual alertness and stood up as he spoke: "Brother Yang Kai, let's leave now."

"We've come this far; why hurry off? That would be rude, and simply leaving might offend the owner here." Yang Kai laughed softly.

Shen Fanlei scratched his head, helpless and wearing a wry smile. Had he known this, he never would have dragged Yang Kai into a place like this; now he hesitated even to try to get away.

"Do you mean we might actually stay here...?" Shen Fanlei looked at Yang Kai awkwardly, both hopeful and indecisive.

Yang Kai laughed loudly: "That depends on Brother Shen's wishes. Of course, it's best to avoid dual cultivation if possible; if it's merely seeking pleasure, then it doesn't matter—it's only a brief moment."

"Brother Yang Kai, you're joking." Shen Fanlei flushed crimson.

At that moment Yang Kai's expression shifted as he turned toward the door. A light knock sounded from outside; the young woman who had led them in returned, saying softly, "Young masters, I was remiss."

She pushed the door open and entered, followed by two maids: one bearing a fragrant wine ewer, the other carrying a plate of spirit fruits. They glided forward, performed a courtesy, set the items on the table, and stood obediently behind the young woman.

The young woman then took a seat beside them and asked, “May I know whether the two young masters have come for pleasure and amusement, or if you have other requests?”

“Suppose we’re here to enjoy ourselves — so what? And if we’ve got other requests, what then?” Yang Kai said evenly, raising an eyebrow, his calm confidence making the young woman hesitate to look down on him.

The young woman smiled, her eyes flashing with endless charm and seduction that made Shen Fanlei's eyes bulge. She parted her lips and said, "If it's merely pleasure you seek, our Hehuan House has many girls with excellent aptitude and stunning beauty for the young masters to choose from. I guarantee satisfaction. Moreover, these girls, whether by cultivation or looks, are far superior to those in the other parts of Black Crow City—though naturally, the price is also higher."

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Price isn't the issue, as long as we're satisfied. But what level of cultivation do the highest girls in your house possess?"

The young woman smiled demurely: "Your eye is sharp. As for the highest cultivation, there's the girl Hong Yue—she possesses Second Stage of the Saint King Realm!"

"Second Stage of the Saint King Realm!" Yang Kai and Shen Fanlei exchanged glances, both astonished; neither had expected such women here. With that level one could easily be accepted into a major Sect rather than drifting as pleasure workers.

The young woman continued: "But Hong Yue only leaves her chamber twice a year. After those two times, no matter the price, she won't go out again—of course, whether she goes out depends on her own will. If she isn't interested, even the highest offer is useless."

"She does have a temper," Yang Kai waved his hand, "never mind; that one's too troublesome."

"Very well." The young woman seemed relieved and eagerly asked, "May I ask, young masters, do you have any other requests?"

Yang Kai looked at her and asked, "I've heard your establishment has a group of women who cultivate the Dual Cultivation Technique and can help people break bottlenecks. Is that true?"

The young woman nodded lightly: "Indeed, our Hehuan House does have such women. And of the visitors who come here with Saint King Realm cultivation, eight out of ten come precisely for that. It seems you two young masters are the same."

"Yes; we've recently encountered bottlenecks in our cultivation that we cannot break through, so we came in hopes of that service."

"If so, that's easy to arrange. If you don't mind, leave everything to me—I will ensure you two young masters leave satisfied," she asked with a smile.

"Very well." Yang Kai nodded lightly.

The young woman rose slowly and walked outside, seemingly to make arrangements. At the doorway she turned back and said, "Before I go, young masters, let me say this first: though some who come here can indeed use dual cultivation to break bottlenecks, not everyone succeeds. If you are unable to achieve your goal..."

"Don't worry—this much we know. If we fail, it will be because our fate isn't right; we won't blame you."

The young woman nodded in satisfaction and then truly left.

After she left, Shen Fanlei looked at Yang Kai suspiciously, wondering why he particularly wanted the women who practiced the Dual Cultivation Technique. Yang Kai offered no explanation. After a moment, Shen Fanlei steeled himself—thinking it was only a moment's pleasure and, as long as there was no dual cultivation, that would be fine—and relaxed, picking up a spirit fruit from the table to eat.

Before long the young woman returned, this time accompanied by a dozen youthful, beautiful girls. Their looks and figures were outstanding, each as pretty as a flower; most remarkable, their cultivation was uniformly First Stage of the Saint Realm—far superior to the girls outside.

As the dozen stood there, fragrance filled the chamber like spring orchids and autumn chrysanthemums, exceedingly bewitching.

Shen Fanlei's eyes flashed with greed as he ogled one and then another, pleased with them all; Yang Kai, however, remained impassive.

The young woman watched their reactions and showed a flicker of surprise, but said nothing, simply clapping her hands lightly.

That first group of girls filed out, and soon another set came in.

The cultivation level of the second group seemed higher still; some of them were already Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

Yang Kai was still unmoved.

The young woman grew more surprised; her brows knit and she clapped her hands again, and the second group withdrew to be replaced by a third.

"Young masters, are you still not pleased?" She waited a moment and, seeing Yang Kai show no sign of being impressed, her pretty face cooled and she asked sharply. After all, the girls just shown were the best the Hehuan House had—some even reached Third Stage of the Saint Realm. One of the young men seemed ready to act on impulse, but the other was infuriatingly reserved, showing nothing at all.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, ignoring her irritation, and said slowly, "Surely your house's standards are higher than this? If this is all, I'd be disappointed."

The young woman sniffed and gestured for the third group to leave; her mouth tightened. "This young master's taste is extraordinary, but indeed our Hehuan House has girls of even higher quality—though few, and their price is staggering. I wonder if the young masters can afford them."
