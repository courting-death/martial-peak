## Chapter 1671 — You are at The Void King Realm?

Qian Tong fell silent. Thinking he was cowed, Xie Chen grew even more smug and brazen, his face contorted as he snarled, "Qian Tong, the prudent know how to bend with the times. The Corpse Spirit Sect has four great Void King Realm experts sitting in command; unifying Dark Star is only a matter of time. Don’t be stubborn — if you bow and submit, this Hall Master can put in a good word for you. With your cultivation, you won’t receive any less attention than I do."

Qian Tong let out a long, weary sigh, his tone carrying a faint desolation—like one standing too long atop a lonely height. Casting a light glance at Xie Chen, he said, “You’re saying there are four Void King Realm experts stationed within the Corpse Spirit Sect?”

"That’s right!" Xie Chen chuckled and nodded.

"Do you even know what Void King Realm means?"

"Void King Realm…" Xie Chen faltered, a hint of confusion flashing across his face. That realm had been talked about on Dark Star for tens of thousands of years; people only knew it was a level above Origin Returning Realm, but when pressed to describe it, Xie Chen had no idea how to put it into words.

After all, he’d never laid eyes on it.

He couldn’t help but flare with embarrassed rage, letting out a low snarl, "You do know, then?"

Qian Tong looked at him calmly and said nothing. He reached out a hand toward Xie Chen, closed his fingers around the void as if grasping air, and then withdrew his hand.

Instinctively Xie Chen stumbled back, circulating his Saint Yuan as a defense. Yet the storm of assault he had imagined never came — not a single wound appeared on his body, and he could detect no trace of Saint Yuan surging from Qian Tong.

"Qian Tong, you dare mock this Hall Master?" Xie Chen exploded in fury, his face flushing and paling in turns. "You’re as good as dead. We come from the same Yingyue Hall — I didn’t want to finish you off, but since you refuse to show me respect, no one will save you today. Kill him!"

Those last words were shouted to his subordinates.

When Yang Kai had previously intervened to save Wei Guchang, he’d noticed keenly that these men were from Yingyue Hall and, without fully understanding the situation, hadn’t cut them down — only pushing them away from Wei Guchang.

None of them were seriously injured; now they had all recovered.

Hearing Xie Chen’s order, a cluster of Origin Returning Realm fighters hesitated, their faces showing doubt.

They feared Xie Chen — who among them didn’t? Though their strength had grown since pledging to the Corpse Spirit Sect, Qian Tong’s old authority ran deep. Being ordered to strike him now, they were understandably anxious.

"Huh? Hall Master, you… you…" Suddenly a middle-aged man, as if witnessing a horrific scene, pointed at Xie Chen in terror and cried out.

Others followed his gaze and collectively gave a startled cry. Terror flitted across their faces and they involuntarily stepped away from Xie Chen, avoiding him like a plague.

"What’s—?" Xie Chen was slow to react. Looking down, his face drained of color as he exclaimed in shock, "What is this!"

He discovered that at the roots of his arms and legs there was a force ravaging his limbs. The energy was visible to the naked eye yet produced no ripple.

That ravaging force, like a leech, tore a small opening into Xie Chen’s flesh and slid inside him.

Throughout the whole process, Xie Chen felt no pain whatsoever.

A bone-chilling sensation rose, a cold that ran from his head to his feet and nearly made the soles of his feet cramp.

Bang bang bang…

Four explosive cracks sounded, blood spattering. Xie Chen’s hands and feet burst into clouds of gore; only a truncated upper torso tumbled to the ground, raising a plume of dust.

Blood flowed, staining the earth. Xie Chen’s face convulsed through expressions, his eyes full of utter disbelief.

The traitors from Yingyue Hall looked as if they’d seen a ghost in daylight; each grew as pale as if they’d plunged into an ice cellar, chilled to the bone.

"No! Impossible! This can’t be! This is a nightmare!" Xie Chen wailed like a wounded beast. Missing hands and feet, he looked both ridiculous and pitiful, as though subjected to a cruel torment.

"I’m a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; only a Void King Realm could do this — I refuse to believe it!" Xie Chen was clearly shattered, frenzied; the words stopped him cold. He stared blankly at Qian Tong, and the fear that had been buried in his eyes finally spread out. He muttered, "Void King Realm… you are already at the Void King Realm?"

If Qian Tong were not at the Void King Realm, it would have been impossible for him to reduce him to such a state with a mere flick of his hand. If Qian Tong were not a Void King, he would still have stood a chance to fight back.

"You’re not entirely stupid!" Qian Tong said coldly.

"What? The Great Elder is already at the Void King Realm?" Wei Guchang stood motionless.

Xuan'er covered her mouth with her small hand; light flared in her eyes as if a drowning person had seized a lifeline — the dimness in her gaze cleared and shone once more.

Void King Realm!

The legendary realm of Dark Star for tens of thousands of years — could their master truly have reached it?

If so, Yingyue Hall might yet be saved! Xuan'er trembled, tears welling in her beautiful eyes. In that instant she thought of the brothers and sisters who had once died before her eyes.

You spirits above, now you can rest — Master has reached Void King Realm and will soon avenge you, slay those murderers, and restore justice!

Thud…

The Yingyue Hall Origin Returning Realm traitors knelt on the ground, panic-stricken, staring at Qian Tong and kowtowing nonstop, begging for mercy.

"Great Elder, I was wrong! I know I was wrong — please spare my life!"

"Great Elder, I was forced into it. My wife and children are in those brigands’ hands; I had no choice but to collude with them. I beg Great Elder to judge me with mercy!"

"Please, Great Elder, spare us. Let us live!"

"Great Elder, be merciful and spare us!"

Qian Tong looked upon them with loathing and hatred. He inhaled lightly and asked, "Chang’er, Xuan'er, did they ever slaughter the loyal of Yingyue Hall?"

"They did!" Wei Guchang’s eyes burned with rage as he answered gravely.

Cruel enemies are hateworthy, but more detestable are traitors who aided them. Wei Guchang had seen these men slaughter their former comrades more than once.

"Good!" Qian Tong’s robes hung motionless though a maelstrom of fury radiated from him like a tsunami, an appalling aura that swallowed the Yingyue Hall traitors. "Since they killed, there’s nothing to discuss!"

With that, Qian Tong reached out and pointed at those men.

Silently, as if struck by lightning, the men stiffened where they stood.

Pain distorted each face; it seemed they were enduring some unbearable torment.

A moment later, boom boom boom…

Thunderous blasts rang out and every one of the traitors exploded, their bodies destroyed and their souls obliterated.

Only Xie Chen remained, his limbs gone, his meridians severed, his cultivation ruined.

"Kill me! Kill me!" Xie Chen howled.

In this state, death would be a mercy. After decades of arduous cultivation, a single lapse had brought such retribution; Xie Chen was full of remorse.

"Killing you would be too easy on you." Qian Tong was unmoved. With a wave of his hand he stemmed the bleeding from Xie Chen’s wounds, lifted him up, and strode toward Tianyun City.

"Chang’er, Xuan'er, come with this old man — we’ll rescue your Senior Uncle Fei!"

Wei Guchang and Xuan'er exchanged a glance and, spirits lifted, hurried after him.

They understood Qian Tong was truly enraged now — otherwise he wouldn’t have acted so cruelly. Killing was ordinarily casual to him; yet this time he had preserved Xie Chen’s life, choosing instead to break him with pain and terror. It seemed Qian Tong intended to make a major upheaval.

“Let’s go take a look as well,” Yang Kai called to Su Yan and Xia Ningshang. “That City Lord Fei once did me a favor.”

“Since he’s our Junior Brother’s benefactor, then of course we must save him,” the two women replied in unison.

……

Inside Tianyun City the vigilance was tight: sentries every few steps, posts every handful of paces, as if guarding against something grave.

On a certain plaza within Tianyun City, Fei Zhi Tu stood disheveled, shackled with heavy fetters on his hands and feet.

He looked wretched and ruined, devoid of any ripple of energy — whether sealed or his cultivation shattered was unclear.

Yet despite his wretched and downtrodden state, he still stood tall and straight.

A great number of Tianyun City residents had gathered around the plaza.

They looked up at Fei Zhi Tu on the high platform with faces full of sorrow and indignation.

Though Fei Zhi Tu had not been perfect as city lord, he had cared for the people and kept Tianyun City relatively safe.

But ever since the Corpse Spirit Sect took over, Tianyun City had descended into chaos.

Countless children vanished without explanation, many beautiful girls were seized, and any slight resistance from the people was met with brutal punishment and suppression.

Compared with life under Fei Zhi Tu’s rule, the present existence was nothing less than torture in hell.

Thus they longed fiercely for the old days.

But today was the day Fei Zhi Tu was to be beheaded as a warning to all of Dark Star: those who resist will suffer a tragic fate.

Not far from Fei Zhi Tu’s platform stood several former high-ranking Yingyue Hall members who had once been close to him; now they clustered around a youth in purple robes who looked resplendent and arrogant, flattering him obsequiously.

The boy appeared about seventeen or eighteen, his complexion unnaturally pale. Around him lingered a faint chill that made onlookers uncomfortable.

From up close one could even smell a faint stench of rot about him.

He sat under the blazing sun, seeming impatient; he kept glancing up at the sun and muttering curses under his breath.

One of the Yingyue Hall traitors read the situation and, understanding, waved his hand and shouted, "Bring the blood feast!"

At once a Saint King Realm warrior rushed over from nearby carrying a child in his hands and leapt to the side of the platform.
