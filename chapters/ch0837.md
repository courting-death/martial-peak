## Chapter 837 — Unbridled

Sun Yu wore the look of someone who had them all figured out, which left the five Transcendent Realm cultivators of Youhan Grotto-Heaven at a loss.

True, the kid had vaulted a major realm in just two years, but he still only possessed Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm; facing five of them, there was no way he could resist.

So why did he not show even a hint of fear? Instead, he looked at them with the cool, taunting gaze of a cat playing with a mouse.

Hesitant for a moment, the middle-aged leader snapped, “You little brat, putting on airs—let’s see how you plan to kill us!”

As he spoke, he waved his hand and barked, “Seize the kid! Kill the old man!”

The four behind him answered the call, moving like lightning and instantly charging to where Ling Jian and his disciple stood.

One lunged at Sun Yu to capture him alive, while the other three struck at Ling Jian, ruthless and intent on a killing blow.

Ling Jian hadn’t even reacted when the three attacks arrived; he broke out in a cold sweat and inwardly thought his life was over.

But in the next moment, something bizarre happened.

The four who had charged in—whether the Transcendent Realm cultivator trying to seize Sun Yu or the three attacking Ling Jian—seemed as if struck by a curse; their movements froze, then pain contorted their faces. Each clutched their heads with both hands and collapsed to the ground, howling miserably.

Within their Seas of Consciousness, their Divine Sense power erupted chaotically, as though some attack was tearing at their Divine Sense.

The middle-aged man’s brows tightened and he shouted angrily, demanding answers.

But there was no response.

In barely five breaths, the four fell utterly still, their bodies rigid on the ground, vitality drained, eyes refusing closure.

Ling Jian stared dumbfounded at it all, his eyes nearly bulging from their sockets.

Sun Yu, too, was panting heavily, his mind unsettled; those Youhan Grotto-Heaven warriors had already seized his arm, yet this sudden turn of events had him momentarily unbalanced.

Looking around with unrestrained joy, Sun Yu knew at once this had to be the doing of Senior Yang.

No wonder he was a master!

The four Transcendent Realm cultivators who had rendered the two helpless had just died inexplicably; from the middle-aged man’s expression, he’d noticed nothing.

Sun Yu relaxed inwardly and turned a feral grin toward the middle-aged man.

Meeting his gaze, the middle-aged man involuntarily stepped back several paces, a chill coursing through him.

“Kid, was that you?” the man asked in a shaky voice, disbelief in every word.

“Do I need to answer someone who’s about to die?” Sun Yu asked nonchalantly, a self-satisfied look on his face as he extended a single finger and pointed vaguely at the middle-aged man.

Terror seized him; he howled, produced his Secret Treasure to protect himself, and fled.

He had no idea what trick Sun Yu had used; four companions of similar strength had suddenly dropped dead. If he stayed, he might be next.

The Dragon Emperor’s legacy—so strange and unfathomable?

In any case, he needed to inform the two Saint Realm seniors in his sect so they could be on guard.

“Die!” Sun Yu shouted fiercely.

As his voice rang out, the middle-aged man—already dozens of zhang away—screamed, clutched his head like the others, and toppled face-first, sliding a long way before coming to rest. His soul departed; his eyes dimmed.

Five Transcendent Realm cultivators lay dead, and Sun Yu’s face flushed with excitement as he scanned his surroundings for praise.

“Well done, keep it up.” The voice of Senior Yang echoed in his mind, and Sun Yu’s vigor surged; he felt charged, itching to fly to his sect’s Youhan Grotto-Heaven and wreak havoc.

“You little—” Ling Jian’s lips trembled and his face went pale; he stammered, “You… you killed five Transcendent Realm cultivators?”

Even now, Ling Jian could scarcely believe it; what he’d witnessed was too unreal, too absurd.

He remembered that two years ago his disciple couldn’t even beat someone of his own rank; now, by a gesture, he had dispatched five enemies far beyond Ling Jian’s reach.

A disorienting, dreamlike feeling swept over Ling Jian.

“It’s not me, Master. It’s the Dragon Emperor legacy,” Sun Yu said, unable to lie to his master, answering smoothly.

Ling Jian stood stunned, then broke into tears, “Heaven has eyes, heaven has eyes!”

“Master, we won’t go to Twin Pavilion. I’ll go find the Palace Master and ask him to help the sect through this crisis!”

“Is that so…” Having seen Sun Yu’s strange method, Ling Jian no longer put up much resistance, though he worriedly added, “There are two Saint Realm experts over there. Even if the Palace Master can hold one, you…”

“Don’t worry, Master. I know my limits!” Sun Yu said confidently, glancing around as if expecting to spot Yang Kai. He didn’t see him, but he knew Senior Yang was hidden close by.

Sun Yu was unbridled!

“Fine. I’ll go with you. I’ll explain things to the Palace Master; when the sect is in danger, we, as disciples, must not flee!” Ling Jian felt his fighting spirit roused by his pupil and surged with resolve.

The master and disciple flew together toward where the great battle raged.

……

Thirty li away in midair, waves of cultivators clashed fiercely; people were wounded and killed, bodies plummeting earthward.

Brilliant displays of Martial Skill and the radiance of Secret Treasures split the sky, laying bare the battlefield’s savagery.

Dragon-Phoenix Palace and Youhan Grotto-Heaven had long been at odds; this time Youhan had come prepared and, with one more Saint Realm expert, gained the upper hand.

The battle had barely lasted half an hour, and Dragon-Phoenix Palace was suffering heavy losses.

Palace Master Chen Zhou and Yu Tingyi fought the two opposing Saint Realm cultivators together, their bodies scarred and their reserves badly depleted.

Had the enemy not feared Chen Zhou’s desperate resistance, those two Youhan Saint Realm experts might already have killed without mercy.

“Bai Jingchu, Yan Zhi, if you don’t annihilate my Dragon-Phoenix Palace today, we’ll hunt you down and wipe you out!” Chen Zhou roared like thunder, full of bitter rage and helplessness.

Yu Tingyi stood beside him, breath ragged, her chest heaving; a smear of red stained her lower abdomen. She was only at the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm and was clearly struggling amid such intense combat.

But because they practiced a Dual Cultivation Technique together, their combined force could boost Chen Zhou’s power during the fight.

She had to take the field—without her, Chen Zhou would be hard-pressed to hold on alone.

Bai Jingchu and Yan Zhi exchanged a look, then stepped out of the fray. The former laughed heartily: “Chen Zhou, since we came today, we’ll do as you wish. We'll annihilate your Dragon-Phoenix Palace, don’t worry about that. As for you hunting us down and wiping us out… you won’t get the chance.”

Chen Zhou brushed the blood at the corner of his mouth and sneered, “The Dragon Emperor’s legacy has surfaced; the Dragon Emperor and Phoenix Empress will return, and they will avenge Dragon-Phoenix Palace.”

Yan Zhi chuckled casually, “In Dragon Valley, right? I don’t know if my men have arrived there yet; by now they should be. Your Dragon Emperor heir is probably in my men’s hands. Don’t worry—I’ll raise your Dragon Emperor heir for you.”

“Yes, he won’t be mistreated. They say the Dragon Emperor heir must seek out a Phoenix Empress heir; Youhan Grotto-Heaven has countless beauties—when he gets there, he’ll be lost in them.”

Their easy banter turned Chen Zhou’s expression ashen; his heart sank.

At Dragon Valley, only Ling Jian stood guard. With his strength, he couldn’t fend off truly formidable foes; if that were the case, Dragon-Phoenix Palace might never rise again.

“Despicable!” Chen Zhou cursed through clenched teeth.

Yan Zhi’s eyes flashed and a pure Divine Sense burst from his Sea of Consciousness, slamming toward Yu Tingyi beside Chen Zhou.

Disturbed by their words, Chen Zhou was caught off guard; by the time he reacted, Yu Tingyi had already been struck.

A wail rose out as if a great force had hit her; the frail woman was flung dozens of zhang backward, her face white as she fell toward the ground.

Chen Zhou’s eyes nearly popped with fury as he rushed to save her, but Bai Jingchu intercepted and sneered, “Without your woman, how do you expect to fight me?”

Dual cultivation indeed amplified their strength when paired, so Yan Zhi seized the chance to grievously wound Yu Tingyi; without her, Chen Zhou could not match them.

As they spoke, Bai Jingchu engaged Chen Zhou directly; energies exploded, the scene erupting in violence.

Yan Zhi’s face was cold as he pursued the wounded Yu Tingyi, murderous intent in his eyes—clearly attempting to finish her off.

“Get away!” Chen Zhou, seeing his partner in mortal peril, flew into a rage. He brandished a fan-like Secret Treasure, whipping out gusts that carried thousands of razor-sharp wind blades, each as keen as a knife.

“Chen Zhou, you’re finished—stop resisting, watch your woman die, and join her in death!” Bai Jingchu sneered without fear and produced a bell-shaped Secret Treasure. Strange sounds emanated from it, forming a shockwave that blocked the wind blades and taunted Chen Zhou to unnerve him.

In the brief delay, Yan Zhi closed in on the badly wounded Yu Tingyi and, grinning evilly, struck at her head without mercy.

At that moment, a silver-leaf Secret Treasure swept in; as it turned it suddenly expanded, wrapping Yu Tingyi within.

Yan Zhi’s palm struck the silver leaf, but it was as if he’d hit a stone sinking into the sea—the force he threw felt like it struck nothing.

Instead, the silver leaf shimmered with layer upon layer of light, its dense, tangible energy rebounding like a tide and flinging Yan Zhi backward.

The silver leaf, cocooning Yu Tingyi, plunged downward and disappeared into Dragon-Phoenix Palace.

Seeing this, a worried Chen Zhou finally exhaled, though his brow remained furrowed—he had no idea which high-ranking figure had intervened to save her.
