## Chapter 1395 — Digging One's Own Grave?

Especially the protective mountain array of Dragon Lair Mountain — its solidity and strangeness — made these experts take it all the more seriously.

Leitai Sect and Battle Sky Alliance need no introduction; Shuangxin Valley, Li Huo Sect, Piaomiao Hall, Qiantian Sect, Wei Huo Alliance — these top-tier powers on Dark Star all coveted Dragon Lair Mountain's protective mountain array.

For such a mere hill to possess so stout a defensive grand formation — who, then, was the divine hand that had arrayed it? No one cared whether Dragon Lair Mountain would live or die, but everyone cared who arranged that formation; rescuing that person at a critical moment might win them over to one’s own faction.

Each harbored unspeakable designs, yet all tacitly chose to watch with cold eyes, allowing the Xie Family to take the lead and marshal several forces to attack Dragon Lair Mountain.

Inside Dragon Lair Mountain, Wu Yi and Qian Yue had retreated behind the protective array, both looking slightly pale.

When the two had gone out side by side to negotiate, although they appeared composed and showed no timidity, anyone who saw so many masters gathered there would be unsettled. The two women had never witnessed so grand a display; especially at this crucial moment, neither Yang Kai nor Yang Yan was in the mountain.

If Wu Yi did not possess a thorough knowledge of Dragon Lair Mountain's formations, she would have been disheartened long ago.

In terms of familiarity with the many grand formations covering Dragon Lair Mountain, aside from Yang Yan herself who had laid them, the next most knowing was Wu Yi — even Yang Kai did not match her. After all, when Yang Yan deployed the arrays, Wu Yi had assisted at her side and, through constant exposure, came to understand what perils the hundred li around Dragon Lair Mountain concealed.

So although they were uneasy inside, their emotions remained fairly steady; after withdrawing to the rear of the grand array they began issuing orders.

But relying solely on the formations to hold was certainly not enough. No matter how solid an array, if it only takes blows and never strikes back, it will eventually be pierced. The current plan was to immediately contact Yang Kai and Yang Yan — as long as either of them stood guard, Dragon Lair Mountain could turn defense into offense.

Yet Wu Yi had no idea where the two had gone, nor when they might return.

Just as anxiety peaked, Qian Yue's expression shifted; she hurriedly drew out her Transmission Compass, sent out a Divine Sense to probe, and after a moment brightened and said, "Yang Kai and Yang Yan are back."

"Really?" Wu Yi was overjoyed, her voice trembling as if a drowning person had grasped a life-saving straw.

"Yes — Yang Kai sent the message."

"Where are they?" Wu Yi looked left and right, but still could see no sign of Yang Kai.

"They are hidden outside. Yang Kai said there are too many people out there; sneaking in without notice would be difficult, so they did not come in. However..."

"However what?"

"He said to have you withdraw the Protective Mountain Array, then have everyone hide inside the Stone Residence, with Guest Elder Chang Qi and Guest Elder Hao An standing by to meet the enemy. He and Yang Yan will look for an opportunity to strike."

"Is that so!" Wu Yi wore a contemplative expression. The others appeared calm, but Ning Xiangchen, who had only been here two days, looked utterly flabbergasted.

That Yang brat can't be sane, can he? Why issue such an outrageous order? Though he had not been at Dragon Lair Mountain long, he knew the fighters' caliber and numbers here: only a few dozen, cultivation uneven — Saint King Realm, Saint Realm, even Transcendent Realm were present; the only ones truly up to the task were Chang Qi and Hao An, both at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

In contrast, the enemy numbered over thirty in the Origin Returning Realm, some even at the second Stage, and more than two hundred at the Saint King Realm. If they relied on the Protective Mountain Array to hold, they could delay, but once the array was withdrawn it would be like smashing an egg against a rock — courting death.

Even if Yang Kai himself were prodigiously powerful, he was only one man; with Chang Qi and Hao An added, what great deed could they perform?

Ning Xiangchen was full of questions and about to speak when he suddenly saw Wu Yi purse her lips into a smile and say calmly, "If that's so, then carry out his orders! It's time to let these shameless rascals see the fangs of Dragon Lair Mountain."

She spoke with absolute certainty, showing no heed for those outside, as if Yang Kai's single command had given her boundless confidence.

Ning Xiangchen nearly bit off his own tongue.

Qian Yue acknowledged and at once began transmitting orders, telling everyone to hide within Yang Kai's Stone Residence. The Stone Residence was the most tightly defended spot on Dragon Lair Mountain, laden with the most sealing formations; without the token to open it, forcing it would be even more difficult than breaching the Protective Mountain Array.

Once Yang Kai's orders were delivered, Wu Yi understood his intention; she naturally offered no objection and simply complied.

The warriors moved in haste. After Qian Yue's summons they poured in from all directions to shelter in the Stone Residence; in the blink of an eye only five remained outside — Chang Qi, Hao An, Qian Yue, Wu Yi and Ning Xiangchen.

At that moment Wu Yi frowned slightly and glanced at Ning Xiangchen; despite her sharpness, she did not know how to place him.

Let him enter the Stone Residence to seek refuge? That would be improper — the Stone Residence was Yang Kai's seclusion place, hiding many unknown secrets. Though sealed, if Ning Xiangchen accidentally discovered something, it would be a troublesome matter.

Letting him leave was definitely out of the question. He had voluntarily stayed before and offered a hand to Dragon Lair Mountain; Wu Yi felt grateful to him. To send him away now would chill his heart. Moreover, with enemies encircling outside, Ning Xiangchen could not simply depart.

It was a maddening dilemma.

Fortunately Ning Xiangchen was worldly-wise and had seen through Wu Yi's worries; he stepped forward and said, "If there is any place this old man can be of use, please do not be polite. Though my strength is not great, I can still lend a hand."

In the space of a few breaths Ning Xiangchen weighed the pros and cons in his heart and decided to gamble once more.

Though he had no idea where Wu Yi and the others drew their confidence, their composed expressions undoubtedly reassured him; perhaps Dragon Lair Mountain truly was a dragon pit and tiger den.

Besides, he had already shown his face before those outside and exchanged words with Xie Li; even if he wanted to betray them now he would be unable to do so — better to go all the way.

Ning Xiangchen had survived worse than this; having faced grimmer situations before, he knew well that the greater the risk, the greater the reward.

Now was, naturally, the best moment for him to make his stance known.

Moreover, even if Dragon Lair Mountain truly could not resist the invaders, he might yet have a chance to escape.

For these reasons Ning Xiangchen chose to take the chance.

“Very well. Since Elder Ning puts it that way, this little woman will not stand on ceremony. Elder Ning, along with Guest Elders Chang and Hao, should simply wait for the right moment to strike. I’ll take my leave first and wish you three Seniors a swift and glorious victory!” After speaking, Wu Yi gave a respectful bow, then turned and walked toward the Stone Residence.

Her cultivation was only Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, so she knew remaining outside would be futile; she decisively entered the Stone Residence.

Only Ning Xiangchen was left standing with his mouth agape, his face dazed.

He had expected Wu Yi to present clear instructions or a proper plan, but instead he received only this vague answer — "wait for the right moment to strike"? It was utter nonsense.

Could it be that he had fallen into a pit of his own making? Ning Xiangchen’s heart sank, anxiety surging to its peak.

Chang Qi patted his shoulder and laughed heartily, "Brother Ning, you will be immeasurably glad you made this decision!"

That same line again! Ning Xiangchen had already heard it twice within the span of a single stick of incense. Yet what kind of trump card lay hidden here, the other side refused to reveal. How fortunate—or rather, how foolish—must he have been to make such a suicidal, grave-digging decision! Ning Xiangchen could only smile bitterly at himself.

"By the way, Old Hao, don't you still have two jars of Drunken Moon Wine?" Chang Qi suddenly remembered and asked Hao An.

"What for?" Hao An asked, his face wary.

Chang Qi curled his lips, "We're old brothers — don't you know what I want to do?"

Hao An flushed with righteous indignation, "Last time Wu Yi brought back ten jars and we split them five and five; you drank your share dry — why are you coveting mine? Do you think Hao is so easy to bully?"

“We're family, why talk like strangers? Now that Brother Ning’s here, Old Hao, don’t be stingy—bring it out and let's take a few swigs, then we can go kill the enemy!” Chang Qi smacked his lips, wearing an expression of pure relish.

Hao An gritted his teeth and glared at him, filled with grief and indignation. After a long moment, he let out a sigh and said, “Enough, enough. I should’ve known you were eyeing these two jars of my fine wine. Since you’ve dragged Brother Ning into it, I can’t very well be stingy—lest others start calling me miserly.”

Saying that, he rubbed his Spatial Ring and took out a jar of wine.

Chang Qi chuckled and, with lightning speed, took several plates of exquisitely fresh spirit-fruits from his own Spatial Ring, then produced tables and chairs and arranged them — it was clear he had prepared in advance.

Hao An broke the seal on the Drunken Moon Wine and filled the three cups, then sat down at ease.

While entertaining Ning Xiangchen, Chang Qi lifted his cup and drained it in one gulp, his face alight with joy, and urged Hao An to fill it again.

Ning Xiangchen watched this seemingly riotous scene with utter bewilderment. He could not fathom how, with a dire enemy pressing in and a knife at their throats, these two old brothers still had the heart to drink and make merry. Did they truly not know how to write the character for death?

After hesitating for a long while, Ning Xiangchen sighed and said, "Brother Chang, Brother Hao, if convenient, could you tell Ning how you plan to repel the enemy later? With the three of us, how can we risk life and death against so many foes outside?"

Hearing his question, Chang Qi and Hao An exchanged a glance and both burst into laughter.

Ning Xiangchen was inwardly annoyed and cried out urgently, "Do you two find this amusing?"

Chang Qi waved his hand slightly, his face turning solemn: "Brother Ning, you've only been at Dragon Lair Mountain a short while, so though I find you agreeable, it's not convenient for me to disclose anything. But I ask you to wait and see — watch how these jumping clowns dig their own graves. Hmm, I won't say more; this cup is not a send-off wine but our victory wine. One jar is worth one hundred thousand Saint Crystals and is extremely hard to obtain. Brother Ning, why not taste it?"
