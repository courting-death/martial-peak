## Chapter 791 — Push Me to the Brink and I'll Turn on You

Even that alone would have been something; it simply showed he had indeed earned the recognition of Her Highness the Saintess.

What was even more remarkable was his cultivation—he was already at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

When they arrived, Xu Hui had been wondering what level this future Saint Lord might possess; if he had been at the Divine Roaming Realm it would have been acceptable—after all, with the Sacred Land's resources and secret methods, in a few decades he could stand at the Martial Peak—yet the reality left him utterly astonished.

Someone so young at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm was a near-mythical existence across the entire continent.

Recalling the message Qian Ning left before his death, Xu Hui couldn't help smiling; the more he looked at Yang Kai, the more pleasing he found him.

"By the way, Your Highness the Saintess, how did you escape from those Overseas Isles? As far as I know, those islands were razed by Saintess Nan—complete devastation; almost no one survived!" While flying, Xu Hui asked curiously.

An Ling'er glanced at Yang Kai; after he gave a slight nod, she related the matter of the ancient ruins beneath the sea.

"The Void Passage?" Xu Hui raised a brow and breathed a sigh of relief. "Heaven has truly favored our Sacred Land—so you emerged from the Void Passage and ended up in the Demon Domain, is that right?"

"Yes." Yang Kai hurriedly nodded, afraid An Ling'er might slip and reveal the Small Xuan Realm as well. "After entering the Demon Domain we unfortunately fell into Xueli's hands, and only escaped a few days ago!"

"Demon General Xueli?" Xu Hui's face changed drastically, and the other three were equally shocked; they hadn't expected Yang Kai and An Ling'er to have escaped from someone of her caliber, and their admiration deepened.

Frankly, if they had fallen into Xueli's hands, it would have been a fate with no hope of survival.

Realizing that, the experts of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land grew all the more reverent toward Yang Kai, the future Saint Lord.

They flew over famous mountains and great rivers, Xu Hui and the others maintaining an unrelenting speed—thousands, even tens of thousands of li a day—and had long since put Saintess Nan's pursuit behind them.

Along the way Xu Hui casually probed Yang Kai's background; upon learning he came from the Tianxiao Sect, he couldn't help but be surprised.

The Tianxiao Sect was by no means weak. It was simply far from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, and the two had little contact.

"The Tianxiao Sect has also seen a sudden surge in strength recently—apparently four experts rose into the Saint Realm at once," said a pale-faced elder with a sigh. "That puts their overall strength above our Sacred Land."

Yang Kai's face brightened on hearing this; he immediately thought of Cang Yan and Fei Yu—those two who had likely obtained the elixir from the Thousand-Year Demon Flower in Fuyun City, which indeed would have helped them greatly.

"I've heard this too," Xu Hui said. "They say those four went to Fuyun City in the Neutral Domain about two years ago with an alchemist to contend for the Thousand-Year Demon Flower…if I'm not mistaken that alchemist was also young, about the same age as our future Saint Lord." Saying this, Xu Hui gave Yang Kai a meaningful look.

Yang Kai's expression remained indifferent; he feigned not to hear—at this point saying anything would be like giving himself away. Xu Hui was shrewd and had clearly already guessed some things.

But the old man meant no ill will, so Yang Kai wasn't overly concerned.

Seeing Yang Kai's silence, Xu Hui chuckled, "No need to envy others. Our Sacred Land will have a new Saint Lord; it won't be long before its Yuan Qi is restored, and perhaps it will even rise another level."

The others hurriedly echoed his words, all offering Yang Kai great expectations.

Yang Kai frowned and said, "Gentlemen, I have no desire to contend for your Saint Lord's throne—when we reach a suitable place, let's part ways."

"What?" Xu Hui looked astonished. "You don't wish to be the Saint Lord?"

Yang Kai nodded. "I've discussed it many times with An Ling'er. I learned your Three Nine Heavens Divine Techniques without fully understanding them; at most I'll simply stop using those three techniques in the future."

The group fell momentarily speechless.

An Ling'er pressed her lips together and said, "I must shoulder much of the blame. He never intended to learn our Sacred Land's divine techniques—if anyone is to be blamed, blame me."

Xu Hui frowned, glanced between Yang Kai and An Ling'er, then suddenly laughed heartily. "Let's not argue over that for now. Since you're from the Tianxiao Sect, we won't make things difficult for you. If it's convenient, come back to our Sacred Land as guests for a time—see it with your own eyes. If afterwards you still insist, we won't force you."

Yang Kai's expression flickered; he understood he couldn't refuse before these Saint Realm experts.

If he were to refuse, they might use force—not to harm him, but to bring him back to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Xu Hui had already shown restraint; with his status and strength, had he truly decided to use force Yang Kai stood no chance of resisting—his words alone testified to his sincerity.

"Very well." Yang Kai gave a slight nod, not wishing to pick a quarrel.

An Ling'er couldn't help but show a delighted expression.

The group pressed on.

Unlike the previous cordial atmosphere, after learning Yang Kai had no intention of becoming Saint Lord, Xu Hui and the other three repeatedly exchanged glances and transmitted thoughts, apparently conspiring.

Yang Kai noticed, but pretended ignorance.

After a moment, the four took turns unleashing a torrent of words, describing the Nine Heavens Sacred Land's might and foundations and laying out all the benefits and splendid prospects that would come with being Saint Lord, attempting to tempt him.

Yang Kai let their silver-tongued words wash over him and remained unmoved, refusing to give in and leaving Xu Hui and the others helpless.

Yet from their descriptions he did glimpse a colossal power.

Each Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, though their tenures were short, could reach the pinnacle of Saint Realm's Third Stage.

Any force that counts even one expert at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm is among the very top.

Moreover, their method of cultivating a Saint Lord was unusual—there were places within the Sacred Land only the Saint Lord could enter, and training there could accelerate one's strength by leaps; the deeper mysteries of this were beyond what Xu Hui and the others could easily explain.

Additionally, a Saint Lord was supported in training by multiple Saintesses—sometimes seven or eight, at minimum three or four—each selected through rigorous trials; whether in innate gifts or beauty, they were unmatched in the world, and they obeyed the Saint Lord unquestioningly, granting his every wish.

In short, becoming the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land meant not only enjoying unparalleled benefits, but also the power to dominate a region.

The sole drawback was the shortened lifespan.

Not only was the Saint Lord's life brief, the Saintesses' lifespans were likewise short.

The previous old Saint Lord once had six Saintesses, yet within fifty years five had perished, leaving only Saintess Nan.

When the old Saint Lord died, Saintess Nan fell at the same time.

The previous generation of Saint Lords and Saintesses no longer existed; now the Sacred Land's hopes rested on Yang Kai and An Ling'er—how could Xu Hui and the others easily let Yang Kai go?

"Great Elder, where are Xiao Lian and the others?" An Ling'er asked, sensing something amiss in Xu Hui and the others' words, her voice trembling.

Xu Hui's expression darkened; after a moment's hesitation he replied, "All dead. Of the four Saintesses of this generation, aside from you the other three were slain by Saintess Nan!"

An Ling'er covered her mouth, her eyes shaking.

She had hoped those three sisters might produce suitable candidates for Saint Lord, in which case the Great Elder and the others would perhaps stop pressuring Yang Kai, but this dire news was impossible to accept.

On reflection, the Saintesses' patrols lacked Saint Realm guardians; once found by Saintess Nan there was simply no way to resist.

She had been lucky to encounter Yang Kai and, by chance, learn of a Void Passage in advance; otherwise her fate might have been the same as the other three Saintesses.

"Your Highness, please accept my condolences," Xu Hui hurried to comfort her. "Thus the entire Sacred Land now depends on the two of you."

Saying this, he fixed a searing gaze on Yang Kai. "Forgive this old man's discourtesy—I'll address you as young brother for now. If you do not agree to become Saint Lord, within a hundred years our Sacred Land will be no more."

Xu Hui spoke earnestly and with gravity.

The other three hurriedly pleaded as well: "Please, young brother, agree to our impertinent request—the Sacred Land's legacy cannot end with our generation!"

Yang Kai drew in a breath and offered comfort. "Tides rise and fall, flowers bloom and wither—no force endures forever. Even the mighty Great Demon God met his end. Besides...the world isn't without people fit to be Saint Lord; it's just that An Ling'er hasn't found one."

"Young brother does not know the inner workings, so it's understandable you'd say that. In her lifetime a Saintess can choose only one candidate for Saint Lord; once chosen, she will not sense others. Now that the Saintess has chosen you, there's no reason she would choose someone else!"

"So you're saying the only one fit to be Saint Lord across the entire world is me?" Yang Kai frowned—suddenly things had become thorny.

Xu Hui and the others all nodded with solemn expressions.

"If young brother refuses, then our Nine Heavens Sacred Land can only await extinction!"

"We beg you, young brother, take up the Saint Lord's mantle!"

"Don't force me—push me too far and I'll turn on you!" Yang Kai shot him a glance.

Xu Hui's face shifted and he hastened to say, "We wouldn't dare!"

Seeing Yang Kai's impatience, An Ling'er quickly interjected, "Didn't we agree not to discuss this now? Why bring it up again?"

Xu Hui gave an embarrassed laugh and shrugged, saying self-deprecatingly, "Old fool that I am—please forgive me, young brother. For now, just return with us to the Sacred Land and let us show you its splendor; you will be well entertained."

"Soon—three to five days more and we will arrive," another added.
