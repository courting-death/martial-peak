## Chapter 632 — You Don't Have the Ability

Hesitation lasted but an instant before Zhou Luo snapped back to his senses, roaring with ferocity, "I'll make you die!"

Yang Kai sneered coldly, "Make me die? You don't have that ability."

"What insolence!" Zhou Luo leapt back two steps, and suddenly a Secret Treasure in the shape of a trident manifested in his hand; the moment it appeared, a frigid killing intent burst forth.

True Yuan poured into it, the trident emitting a continuous buzzing as its power was provoked, and Zhou Luo flicked his wrist, launching the trident.

The trident tore through the void and abruptly transformed into a majestic, fierce tiger that opened its bloodthirsty maw and lunged to bite Yang Kai.

He clearly did not intend to waste words with Yang Kai; his sole aim was to kill him and purge the hatred at his heart.

Yang Kai snorted coldly; his expression quickly hardened. The other party's heedless attempt on his life had stirred his anger.

His figure flashed, evading the trident's attack.

Power surged through his body; in an instant Yang Kai's aura shifted, and a presence that made Zhou Luo's blood run cold spread around him.

Centered on Yang Kai, an invisible tide of energy rolled out, raising gust after gust of violent wind.

Yun Xuan stopped crying, staring blankly at Yang Kai, her face full of astonishment — shocked by his transformation, she momentarily forgot all that had just happened to her.

Even Ruan Xinyu could not help covering her mouth, dumbstruck.

Boom, boom, boom…

Yang Kai strode forward in rapid steps, his movement like a sudden swell impossible to predict; in a moment he was beside Zhou Luo, and under the latter's aghast gaze a violent True Yuan imprint struck his chest.

A wail of agony rang out as Zhou Luo, taken completely off guard, was flung like a paper kite, bleeding in midair, a pitiful sight.

Yang Kai watched coldly and did not pursue.

Thud…

Zhou Luo's body crashed heavily to the ground; he scrambled up at once, wiping fresh blood from the corner of his mouth, a cruel glint flashing in his eyes. "Playing dumb to catch a tiger? You're certainly no good!"

Only now did he fully grasp that Yang Kai's true strength was far more than the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage cultivation he had displayed.

To wound him so with a single strike — when Zhou Luo himself was at the Divine Roaming Realm, Ninth Stage — this was not something a mere Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage cultivator could do.

"Xinyu, join me — kill him." Having glimpsed Yang Kai's power, Zhou Luo would not let it rest; he even tried to drag Ruan Xinyu into it.

In his mind, one-on-one he was at a disadvantage; with Ruan Xinyu added, surely she could not fail to defeat Yang Kai?

No matter how formidable he was, he was still only a Divine Roaming Realm cultivator.

Zhou Luo was determined to take Yang Kai's life.

A chilling light flickered in Yang Kai's eyes; he had spared Zhou Luo earlier because the man was a disciple of the Duao Alliance and Yang Kai did not wish to bring trouble upon himself — but his mercy had been misread.

He turned his head and glanced faintly at Ruan Xinyu, who had not yet recovered from her shock, still staring as if petrified.

If that woman agreed at once, Yang Kai would not mind opening a slaughter here.

"Xinyu!" Zhou Luo barked.

Ruan Xinyu finally came to her senses, knitting her brow and snapping, "Are you insane? Why would you try to kill him for no reason?"

Zhou Luo's face went green as he looked at Ruan Xinyu with anguished fury. "Even you side with him? Were you defiled by him while I lay unconscious?"

That accusation instantly enraged Ruan Xinyu. She spat, "You're talking rubbish! Zhou Luo, pull yourself together — stop making trouble."

"Heh, making trouble?" Zhou Luo laughed in a neurotic way, his reason clearly shaken by the blow he had suffered.

At that moment Yun Xuan slowly rose to her feet, glanced at Yang Kai with a distant look, brushed the damp hair from her ear, inhaled deeply, and said, "Zhou Luo, stop. If you dare strike him again, don't blame me for being ruthless."

Zhou Luo staggered, staring at Yun Xuan in unbelief, shaking his head repeatedly: "Of course you're that lowly wench — defiled by him in body, and your heart taken by him as well?"

Yun Xuan, angered and shamed, replied coldly, "Keep affairs separate. I don't want to talk to you about this now; my matters are none of your concern — mind your own business."

"Mind my own business, huh, hehe!" Zhou Luo sneered, madness evident in his manner.

He had completely lost his wits.

His gaze hardened into hatred; looking at Yun Xuan and Ruan Xinyu, pain and scorn etched his face. He beckoned with a hand and the trident flew back, sneering, "Since you say that, I'll be no gentleman — today I must kill this brat!"

Yun Xuan shook her head slowly. "You don't have that ability."

"Even you say that!" Zhou Luo exploded in rage; Yun Xuan's words mirrored Yang Kai's earlier remark almost exactly, humiliating him. Gritting his teeth he said, "Then watch and see whether I, Zhou Luo, have that ability!"

Saying this, True Yuan surged madly through him; disk-sized spheres of light suddenly welled up from his body.

"Oh no!" Ruan Xinyu's face drained of color. "Zhou Luo has gone mad."

This move was Zhou Luo's most powerful technique, one he never used lightly; yet now, facing Yang Kai, he unleashed it, clearly unable to distinguish right from wrong, his mind devoured by hatred and shame.

While he spoke, Ruan Xinyu hurriedly retreated to avoid being caught in the blast. She even pulled Yun Xuan away, fleeing far.

Yang Kai had not spoken through it all, watching coldly; only when those spheres of energy streamed from Zhou Luo did his expression grow slightly serious.

He could feel the tremendous killing power contained within those spheres.

Yet he remained calmly unafraid.

The spheres suddenly shot forth, accompanied by Zhou Luo's trident; the combination was mutually reinforcing, the destructive force several times greater than before.

This was the true full-force eruption a Divine Roaming Realm, Ninth Stage warrior should possess.

"Watch out!" Yun Xuan cried without thinking; after shouting her face flushed red — she did not know why she had warned Yang Kai, only that the earlier chaotic moment had left their relationship strangely altered.

She hated the young man who had taken her purity while she was in a daze, especially since he was at least seven or eight years younger than her!

Yet she felt no desire to kill him.

Had it been someone else who treated her so, Yun Xuan was sure she would have found a way to eliminate that man and then take her own life.

Strange, complicated feelings rose in her heart, compelling her to warn Yang Kai when she saw him in danger.

Ruan Xinyu cast her an odd look; Yun Xuan wished she could find a hole to hide in and never see anyone again.

"You... him..." Ruan Xinyu's gossiping curiosity flared up.

"Don't ask me." Yun Xuan's neck flushed as she felt an inner resistance.

"Oh." Ruan Xinyu fell silent immediately.

Boom, boom, boom…

Not far away, Zhou Luo's attack struck; the released energy wrapped Yang Kai completely, leaving him with no way to the heavens or the earth.

The two women instinctively covered their mouths, their eyes trembling.

Pa, pa, pa…

Another series of light cracks sounded; the chaotic energy detonated repeatedly and was successively extinguished. Before long Yang Kai's figure emerged.

Not a hair out of place, save for the wound in his abdomen — this time it poured out more blood and his face looked slightly pale.

Zhou Luo staggered back several steps, staring at Yang Kai in horror and whispering, "Impossible!"

His strike was invincible among Divine Roaming Realm warriors — there was no reason the other should be able to dispel it so easily.

"Nothing is impossible!" Yang Kai took a step forward, already impatient. He was injured and should be recuperating properly; forced to fight a man who had lost his mind, he wanted a swift conclusion. "I did not originally intend to kill you, but now it seems leaving you alive is of no benefit to me."

Saying that, his form suddenly blurred.

Zhou Luo's eyes widened as he sensed imminent danger, but before he could react, every bone in his body felt as if struck by a crushing blow.

Sounds of breaking echoed, sharp and dense like snapped beans.

Yang Kai appeared again, but Zhou Luo had lost all strength; his bones were pulverized, his organs crushed to pulp, his heart meridians severed — he went limp as if boneless.

All vitality extinguished.

"Cough, cough…" Yang Kai staggered a couple of steps and steadied himself, clutching at his wound as blood flowed between his fingers.

He cast a distant glance at Yun Xuan; he found to his surprise that her expression seemed somewhat elated, though he could not fathom what she was happy about.

He shook his head in helplessness and ignored her, quickly settling into a cross-legged posture to continue cultivating and recuperating.

"Yun Xuan..." Ruan Xinyu looked at the scene before her, nearly unable to think. "What should we do?"

"Do what?" Yun Xuan was also weak, breathing lightly as she asked.

"He killed Zhou Luo."

"You want to avenge Zhou Luo?" Yun Xuan turned her head and coldly regarded Ruan Xinyu; the other immediately noticed the flicker of hostility and vigilance in her beautiful eyes.

"I have no such thought." Ruan Xinyu hastened to clarify. "I already disliked him, but he was still a squad leader in the alliance — for him to die before our eyes..."

"Isn't the number of dead this time enough? One more Zhou Luo makes little difference; with people like him gone, the alliance will at least get quieter. Yes, when we return I'll report it to the higher-ups; you needn't trouble yourself." Yun Xuan said calmly.

After the upheaval she seemed to have steadied her mind; she had sorted out many things and was no longer frantic and helpless as before — rather, she had become much more composed.

"You...you really are on his side." Ruan Xinyu's expression turned ambiguous. "What's so good about him?"

Yun Xuan's cheeks reddened and she chided, "Don't talk nonsense."

Saying that, she glanced faintly at Yang Kai, then hurriedly averted her eyes; her long lashes trembled.

"You should rest; I'll take care of things here." Ruan Xinyu sighed, looking at the corpses and the chaotic scene, massaging her temples with a headache.

Yun Xuan nodded lightly, thinking for a moment before sitting cross-legged to close her eyes and cultivate.
