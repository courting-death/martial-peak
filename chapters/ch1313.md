## Chapter 1313 — Ice Soul Pearl

Though it was just a faint, casual greeting, the four words “Elder Qian Yue” entered the woman’s ears and made her slender body tremble violently. She jerked her head up, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Immediately, joy and confusion burst from her beautiful eyes—she seemed to recognize Yang Kai, yet dared not be certain, her expression tangled and complex.

"What? Has Elder Qian Yue forgotten Yang Kai?" Yang Kai smiled faintly at her.

"Yang Kai!" Qian Yue cried out, covering her mouth with one hand, her lovely eyes trembling violently. "It really is you!"

"In a place like this, besides me, who else would know you are Elder Qian Yue?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

Qian Yue's expression grew stranger as she stared at Yang Kai, half wanting to laugh and half wanting to cry. She struggled with her emotions for a long while before calming, a trace of affection appearing in her eyes as if she had found a long-lost family member. She drew in a soft breath and her full, supple chest rose; only then did she greet him, "I never imagined I would meet you here."

Yang Kai grinned: "I never expected it either."

“Oh, right — sit down, let’s talk.” Qian Yue suddenly came back to her senses and hurriedly gestured for him to take a seat.

Yang Kai nodded and sat down as she suggested.

Qian Yue sat as well; facing each other, the two fell silent. Each had a bellyful of questions they wanted to ask, but for the moment neither knew where to begin.

Qian Yue's mood was unsettled, and Yang Kai felt the same—this Miss Yue'er before him was in fact the former Elder Qian Yue of the Ice Sect from the Tongxuan Continent.

Yang Kai had not dealt with this woman often, only knew her by sight; however, she had instructed Su Yan in cultivation, not in a formal master-disciple capacity, but there was still a debt of teaching between them.

When Meng Wuya brought Xia Ningshang and Su Yan back to the Tongxuan Continent through the underground Void Passage of Zhongdu, because Meng Wuya was bound with a body-sealing technique and needed to remove the Tianxuan seal placed on him by the Demon Lord Changyuan, he could not always protect Su Yan, so he entrusted Su Yan to the Ice Sect, a secluded sect that seldom revealed itself.

Later Yang Kai also arrived on the Tongxuan Continent, making inquiries and traveling about; he went to the Ice Sect, where he had seen Elder Qian Yue and even once fought her.

At that time the Ice Sect had several elders who had entered the Saint Realm besides Qian Yue. Yang Kai vaguely remembered another called Qian Hao, Qian Yue's elder brother, and the Ice Lord Qing Ya had achieved the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—one of the few pinnacle figures on the Tongxuan Continent.

Back then Yang Kai was only of the Transcendent Realm; his ability to contend with the Ice Sect's Saint-Grade elders relied entirely on the Soul-Devouring worms. He ultimately forced Ice Lord Qing Ya out and, after lengthy discussion, was able to merge souls with Su Yan—bringing the Dual Cultivation Technique to completion.

Having been apart for less than twenty years, the elder-level figure Yang Kai once had to look up to now appeared fallen and adrift, seemingly unable to make free choices and only able to wait here for patrons to select her to aid in breaking bottlenecks through dual cultivation. The vicissitudes of the world moved his heart, and besides, his own cultivation now surpassed that of Elder Qian Yue.

Thoughts flashing through his mind, Yang Kai suddenly shifted in expression and smiled: "I heard Miss Yue'er once cultivated an ice-attribute technique; I wonder of what origin you are, and how you came to drift to this place?"

Qian Yue's brows tightened and she instinctively glared at Yang Kai, but seeing an unusual light in his eyes she felt something and replied lightly, "Indeed I once cultivated an ice-attribute technique, but that has nothing to do with you. As for how I came to be here, that is not for you to concern yourself with."

Yang Kai took no offense and smiled calmly. "Very well, then I will not ask. But since we will be dual cultivating later, it is proper we speak more to deepen mutual understanding. I would like to have a long, close conversation with you—how do you feel about that?"

"If it is the honored guest's request, I will of course cooperate," Qian Yue replied evenly.

Yang Kai inclined his head gently and began to chat casually with Qian Yue about trifling matters, mostly amusing rumors from various places. Qian Yue listened with evident interest; though her expression remained cold, curiosity gleamed in her beautiful eyes.

After a long moment, Yang Kai paused mid-sentence, his expression tightening slightly. He gave Qian Yue a faint nod and said, “Alright — that probing Divine Sense has left.”

Qian Yue's face tightened and she showed astonishment as she said, "Yang Kai, you are still hard to see through. Back then you, only a Transcendent Realm, dared to single-handedly barge into the Ice Sect. Now here in Hehuan House you can even detect those people's Divine Sense surveillance—how did you manage that?"

A Divine Sense capable of monitoring here must belong to an Origin Returning Realm expert! Had Qian Yue not perceived an oddity in Yang Kai's expression, she would not have been so cooperative with him.

Yet Qian Yue clearly sensed Yang Kai's cultivation was only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, which greatly surprised her.

Yang Kai smiled faintly, "My Divine Sense is simply stronger than that of ordinary warriors."

“More than just a little stronger, I’d say.” Qian Yue gave a wry smile and shook her head. She didn’t press him further, but instead asked urgently, “How did you end up in this place?”

"I was about to ask you the same," Yang Kai said solemnly, fixing his gaze on her.

"That is a long story," Qian Yue smiled wryly. She picked up the teacup and teapot from the table, poured a cup for Yang Kai, composed her thoughts, and then began, "You must now understand why our Ice Sect once remained in the Glacier World and shunned the world, right?"

"Yes, I have some understanding. It is said you were stationed there to keep watch over the Bone Race," Yang Kai nodded as memories churned.

“Exactly — but the Bone Race’s resurgence was far too fierce, something our Ice Sect had never anticipated. Among them was even an existence none of us could possibly withstand. And our Ice Sect was no longer what it once was — with only a few at the Saint Realm, we couldn’t hope to resist! Fortunately, in the past, when our seniors of the Ice Sect slew the Bone Race, they had seized a Star Shuttle. That Star Shuttle was passed down to each generation’s Ice Lord. After the sect’s downfall, Ice Lord Qing Ya knew we had no hope of escape, so she took the desperate gamble of charging into the Starry Sky Gate near the sect. Relying on the power of that Star Shuttle, we managed to enter the Starry Sky!”

"I have already heard this," Yang Kai inhaled deeply. "Having entered the Starry Sky, how did you end up here? Where are Ice Lord Qing Ya and Su Yan now?" he asked urgently.

Qian Yue's expression dimmed; seeing this, Yang Kai's face went pale and a bad premonition rose in his heart.

Perceiving his look, Qian Yue immediately knew he had misunderstood and waved a hand, "Do not think too much. Although I do not know where they are now, Ice Lord Qing Ya and Su Yan should be unharmed."

"How can you be so certain?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

"Because of this." Qian Yue suddenly turned her wrist and two crystal-clear ice pearls appeared in her palm, each no bigger than a fingernail, pure and flawless.

At the sight of the two pearls Yang Kai's expression changed; his eyes fixed on one of them and would not move. From that pearl he felt Su Yan's aura, while the other held the presence of Qing Ya.

"What are these?" Yang Kai looked up at Qian Yue.

"They are Ice Soul Pearls condensed by our Ice Sect's secret art. As long as the pearl exists, the person lives; if the pearl shatters, then the person has perished," Qian Yue explained softly. "Each Ice Soul Pearl corresponds to an individual. We refined them out of fear that we might become separated after entering the Star Domain, so they serve as a safeguard. I hold their pearls and they hold mine. Since these two have not broken, it proves they are still among the living."

Hearing this, Yang Kai's heart lightened and joy flashed in his eyes.

As long as Su Yan was unharmed he could rest; though he did not know her current location, he firmly believed they would meet again.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai said, "May I have that Ice Soul Pearl?"

Qian Yue smiled faintly, "Of course, for you are Su Yan's closest person in this world."

Saying so, she handed over the Ice Soul Pearl that belonged to Su Yan. Yang Kai thanked her and took it.

It was icy to the touch, and it brought to mind Su Yan's face and every smile from the past, a tenderness flickering across Yang Kai's eyes. He felt the familiar aura once more and then carefully stored it within his Black Book Space.

After that, Yang Kai let out a long sigh and felt both body and mind relax. The long-standing, invisible pressure in his chest dissolved in that instant, and his Saint Yuan began to surge violently, stirring the surrounding Spiritual Qi into turbulent motion.

Knowing Su Yan was safe and the weight lifted, his qi churned restlessly, showing faint signs of an imminent breakthrough.

For a long time Yang Kai had seldom spoken of Su Yan; even to himself only occasionally. Yet that worry and attachment had quietly become a stumbling block on his path, a shackle around his heart.

Now that shackle crumbled under the impact of Su Yan's aura, and with the Ice Soul Pearl confirming her life, he relaxed. The last time in the Flowing Flame Sandland, after refining the Profound Yin Moon Water, his cultivation rose to the peak of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm; nearly two years having passed, he was indeed on the verge of another breakthrough.

Today's events were merely a trigger. Even without them Yang Kai estimated he would break through within three months to half a year. He was eager to return to Dragon Lair Mountain to make preparations.

Qian Yue had noticed the anomaly in him and, surprised, was about to offer congratulations when Yang Kai frowned. He forcibly suppressed the surging Saint Yuan, his face flushing slightly before he acted as if nothing had occurred.
