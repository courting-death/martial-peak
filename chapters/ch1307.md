## Chapter 1307 — Warning

“Of course, just entering a Sect at first means your rank and treatment won't be very high, but with your cultivation, after completing a few Sect assignments, becoming an inner disciple shouldn't be a problem. I wonder, Brother Yang, would you be interested in participating in this trial? If so, I can arrange a trial token for you.” With that, Shen Shitao looked at Yang Kai expectantly, genuinely hoping to become his fellow disciple.

After all, Yang Kai's strength wasn't insignificant; once he became a fellow disciple, in future travels she could more legitimately invite him along.

Under her gaze, Yang Kai pondered and did not immediately refuse, which made Shen Shitao's expression change—she seemed to think there was a chance and was about to press the advantage when Yang Kai spoke: “Miss Shen, I appreciate your kind offer, but I currently have no intention of entering any Sect.”

Shen Shitao's face darkened; she was somewhat surprised by Yang Kai's answer.

Yang Kai smiled and explained, “If I truly were alone, entering a Sect wouldn't matter, but Miss Shen has also seen that I have companions.”

“You mean that Miss Yang Yan?”

Yang Kai nodded and said, “Not just her—there are others, around dozens in total.”

“Dozens……” Shen Shitao was stunned.

“Mm, and their cultivations are uneven — some are at the Origin Returning Realm, some at the Saint King Realm, and there are even a few who have just stepped into the Saint Realm,” Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

“I see……” Shen Shitao murmured, then smiled: “No wonder you refuse. Since Brother Yang has such concerns, I won't say any more.”

Although Shen Shitao was a bit disappointed she couldn't persuade Yang Kai to join the trial, given his reasons she wouldn't press the matter. She chatted with Yang Kai for a while longer, then took her leave and returned to another nearby small peak.

After she left, Yang Kai smiled slightly, his gaze flickering as if contemplating something. Then a glint flashed in his eyes as he fixed his stare on a point in the void and said calmly, “Watching for so long, have you discovered anything?”

As his voice fell, a faint, fleeting ripple of aura seemed to come from that direction in the void, but it vanished in an instant with nothing unusual revealed.

Yang Kai gave a cold snort. “What’s this? Since Brother Wang has already come, must I personally invite you before you’re willing to show yourself?”

Hearing Yang Kai call him out by name, a ripple ran through the void and a figure suddenly appeared there with strange suddenness. He glared at Yang Kai with a sullen face and, unbelieving, demanded, “How did you detect my trace?”

As he spoke he retracted the cloak-like Secret Treasure he wore and stared at Yang Kai, saying in a low voice, “My concealment cloak is an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure; you couldn't possibly have detected a flaw.”

“An Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure!” Yang Kai raised a brow and looked at him with an almost-smile: “Brother Wang certainly has a fine treasure, and its grade isn't low, but with your strength you can't unleash its full power. Fortunately I'm very sensitive to others' prying—heh!”

“Some skill!” Wang Yuhan snorted coldly, exposing himself openly and showing not the slightest embarrassment.

“Brother Wang, why aren't you over there recuperating? Why come here? If I hadn't sensed your aura I might have already struck.” A faint smile played at Yang Kai's lips.

“Hmph, my wounds have healed. I bear no ill intent; I'm merely curious.” Wang Yuhan replied coolly.

“If it’s only curiosity, then there’s no harm done. But if Brother Wang has any grievances with me, you might as well speak them directly. If it’s something I can change, I will — and if I can’t, then Brother Wang will simply have to endure it for a while.”

“I have no grievance against you.” Wang Yuhan’s expression darkened for a moment before he suddenly smiled faintly. “Still, it was a wise choice to refuse Miss Shen’s invitation. Though your strength isn’t weak, it’s still a bit lacking for entering a grand sect like Qiantian Sect. If you were to disappoint Miss Shen’s good intentions and make things awkward for her, it wouldn’t look too good on your part.”

“That’s my own concern, no need for Brother Wang to trouble yourself over it. Mm, if Brother Wang has nothing else, please take your leave. I’m only here to borrow the Black Crow City’s Space Array with my companion—once that’s done, we’ll naturally be on our way.”

“That's for the best!” Wang Yuhan nodded with no expression, made a slight salute, and prepared to depart.

Yang Kai suddenly added, “By the way, I don't like being observed in secret. I'll let this pass this time, but if there is a next time…”

“What will you do!” Wang Yuhan turned and glared coldly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gave a sly smile, and the Divine Sense in his Sea of Consciousness surged, suddenly sweeping toward Wang Yuhan.

Wang Yuhan's face changed drastically. In that instant he sensed a wave of death surge toward him; just as he prepared to counterattack the feeling vanished, and Yang Kai sat there smiling as if he'd done nothing.

Wang Yuhan's expression immediately turned to doubt and fear; a cold sweat broke out on his back, and after a long moment he turned and flew off into the distance.

“What’s he getting jealous over? Ridiculous!” Yang Kai muttered.

He naturally understood why Wang Yuhan held some displeasure toward him, and also why he had been hiding nearby. But Yang Kai had no interest whatsoever in Shen Shitao. After leaving Black Crow City this time, they might very well never meet again. That Wang Yuhan was simply being paranoid.

Though Yang Kai knew the man was no good, he didn’t bother warning Shen Shitao. He wasn’t the sort to whisper behind someone’s back, and besides — Shen Shitao wasn’t some clueless girl. She could surely see what kind of person Wang Yuhan really was.

For him, borrowing Black Crow City's Space Array was enough; he didn't want to meddle. Still, since the man had been spying, Yang Kai resolved to teach him a lesson. The Divine Sense intimidation he displayed earlier seemed fleeting and harmless, but he had secretly planted a seed of dread in Wang Yuhan's heart. If future conflicts arose, triggering that Divine Sense seed would turn Wang Yuhan into a lamb led to slaughter.

With Yang Kai's current powerful Divine Sense, doing this to a Third Stage Saint King cultivator would naturally go unnoticed—only someone of the Second or Third Origin Returning Realm personally probing Wang Yuhan's Sea of Consciousness could possibly find and dispel that seed.

The chance of that happening was vanishingly small, so Yang Kai wasn't worried.

After a moment's thought, satisfied he had neither revealed his strength nor shown a flaw, Yang Kai closed his eyes and returned to his own affairs.

Three days later, Shen Fanlei and the others finished healing and came out of seclusion, while on Yang Yan’s side, she had already handed Yang Kai a ring-shaped item. The ring was chilling to the touch, clearly forged from materials of extreme cold attributes — and within it, Yang Kai could faintly sense the aura of Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade.

Probing inward with Divine Sense, Yang Kai immediately discovered the Sun's True Essence stored inside; the ring had many sealing arrays around it, concentrating vast cold to suppress the Sun's True Flame.

The ring resembled a Spatial Ring, but its capacity was tiny—only within a three zhang radius—and it seemed to be a Secret Treasure Yang Yan specially forged to store the Sun's True Essence.

With such an item, Yang Kai no longer worried about the Sun's True Essence's aura being exposed, and it made transportation convenient. After examining it, he was overjoyed and praised Yang Yan heartily, extolling her praise as unparalleled in heaven and earth.

Yang Yan shot Yang Kai a sharp glare.

After finishing here and reuniting with Shen Shitao and the others, they learned the others were nearly ready to depart as well.

After a brief discussion, the six of them headed for Black Crow City. Along the way, Wang Yuhan, unlike his usual enthusiasm, fell silent and kept his distance from Yang Kai; when unobserved his looks toward Yang Kai were strange.

Shen Shitao and the others didn't notice; on the road she told Yang Kai more about Black Crow City.

From her explanation Yang Kai learned that Black Crow City's geography was special, so no single power could dominate it: it sat at the junction of three mid-level powers—Jidao Sect, Quehe Sect, and Wuji Pavilion. The three had fought for the city's ownership for years, suffering casualties, yet none managed to take the city.

In the end some agreement—unknown to outsiders—left the city alone, and nobody intervened in Black Crow City's affairs.

This allowed Black Crow City to grow a respectable force of its own under the leadership of its city lord, who recruited many powerful warriors to garrison it. Using nearby mineral veins, the city survived in the gap between the three powers.

Moreover, there are many such cities across the Dark Star; most arose because rival powers couldn't decide ownership and left the city to its own devices, allowing the city itself to become a force.

Such cities attract many unaffiliated cultivators; by recruiting them they occasionally gain some powerful warriors.

Such cities were generally known as Free Cities. There were at least several hundred of them scattered across Dark Star. Unlike sects, they imposed no strict rules, their management was loose, and the position of City Lord changed hands frequently — whoever had the strongest fist ruled. Because of that, few of these cities ever grew into anything significant. The major powers simply turned a blind eye to them, and in fact, often cooperated with them instead.

Exceptions exist: two or three cities on the Dark Star rival powerful Sects—these are tightly controlled by one or several clans, relatively united; though internal strife occurs, it's kept within bounds, and when external enemies attack they band together.

After centuries or millennia of growth, these super cities on the Dark Star hold weight comparable to major Sects.
