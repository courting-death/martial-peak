## Chapter 1348 — Two Options

Two circular archways, one black and one white, stood before the gathered crowd and posed a single, binary dilemma. Ordinarily most would favor the white, for black commonly signifies mystery and evil, but in this place such assumptions held no weight—no one could say where those two circular Spatial Array Gates would lead.

Perhaps one path led to life and the other to death, or perhaps neither did...

Fei Zhi Tu could only pin his hopes on Cai He and Du Sisi.

Hearing this, the two Formation Masters exchanged glances, both looking troubled. Cai He said, “Although we’ve studied the Dao of Formations, we know nothing about spatial power and have never come into contact with something like a Spatial Array Gate. Still, the principles of formations remain the same despite their countless variations. If Senior Fei trusts us, Miss Sisi and I can examine it to see if we can find a suitable path through.”

Fei Zhi Tu nodded lightly. "Good. Don’t rush. You two study carefully, and if you find any clue, report to me."

Only then did Cai He and Du Sisi step forward, lay out their array-breaking implements, and begin probing around the two Spatial Array Gates.

The others were helpless; they could only sit or stand and keep watch. Even Yang Kai, who had trained in spatial power, could do little. The situation was clear: both Spatial Array Gates could be used, but where they led was unknown. All hope rested on Cai He and Du Sisi.

Unfortunately, though the two of them had been nurtured by their families since childhood and had devoted themselves to the study of the Dao of Formations, they were still at a loss in the current situation. At first, their cooperation went smoothly, but before long they began to disagree and quietly argue. One seemed inclined toward passing through the white Spatial Array Gate, while the other favored the black one. Neither could convince the other, and both were merely going by instinct, with no solid reasoning to back their choices.

Cai He, who had feelings for Du Sisi, nevertheless argued his point firmly—this was a serious matter, and he would not yield an inch.

Watching this, Yang Kai let out a faint sigh.

In terms of formation mastery, the two were skilled, but compared to Yang Yan they were far behind. Yang Kai had noticed this before when encountering certain arrays; if Yang Yan were to break them, she would likely find the Formation Eye in no time, yet these two, working together, took far longer.

If Yang Yan were here, what choice would she make?

Yang Kai squinted at the two array openings and smiled wryly, privately thinking that if Yang Yan were in this situation she would most likely choose the black one.

There was no other reason: that lass always wore a black robe, wrapped her head and face, and clearly had a fondness for black.

As he indulged in these idle thoughts, a tremendous tugging force suddenly issued from the two Spatial Array Gates, and the lake-smooth surfaces of the gates themselves formed enormous whirlpools, funnel-shaped vortices—the pulling force emanating from those spirals.

It seemed the array-breaking implements Cai He and Du Sisi had scattered had affected the Spatial Array Gates, causing them to react on their own.

The pull was so great that everyone’s faces blanched; when the force reached them each felt their bodies drawn irresistibly toward the black and white gates.

Fei Zhi Tu and the others shouted as they forced their Saint Yuan to surge, yet still could not resist. They felt themselves inching toward the two gates and shouted urgently, "Cai lad, Du girl, have you decided which is correct?"

Cai He and Du Sisi now wore panicked expressions; still arguing, they could not come to quick agreement, and so each cried out a different color.

Hearing this, Fei Zhi Tu realized he could not rely on them; he did not blame them, but he had not imagined such a strange occurrence here.

"Can’t hold it!" Ning Xiangchen barked, and wisely chose to give up. He turned and said, "Brother Fei, I’ll go ahead."

With that he charged into the white gate, and in the blink of an eye his figure vanished within it.

At the same time, the old woman was pulled before the black gate; seeing Ning Xiangchen rush to the other gate she struggled, but to her despair she could not escape the black gate’s pull and cried out as she was sucked into it.

In the blink of an eye, two Origin Returning Realm had submerged into different Spatial Array Gates, leaving everyone staring at one another, unsure which choice to make.

Moreover, even if they had wanted to choose, they found themselves powerless. The warrior surnamed Wen and Fei Zhi Tu were both hauled to the white gate; seeing resistance futile, Fei Zhi Tu gritted his teeth and commanded in a low voice, "Go in!"

Saying so, he and the warrior surnamed Wen plunged into the white gate.

Before the two entered, Lian Guang had already disappeared; everyone was flustered and had not noticed where he had been drawn. Only Yang Kai, a bit farther away, was still struggling, while Cai He and Du Sisi, aided by their array-breaking tools, could barely resist.

Watching most people surge into the white gate, Du Sisi ground her teeth and twisted her waist to follow, but Cai He yanked her back and snapped, "This way is right!"

Du Sisi barely had time to flare at him before the two were drawn into the black gate.

Yang Kai finally reached the two gates and stared at their differing colors, a bitter grin at the corner of his mouth as he murmured, "Yang Yan, ah Yang Yan, don’t let me down!"

Saying that, he deliberately moved toward the black gate.

In the next moment the gate swallowed him; after a dizziness and a blur, Yang Kai found himself somewhere else. Before he could carefully inspect his surroundings he heard Du Sisi’s scolding and Cai He’s apologetic voice.

Fortunately the place they arrived at was not dangerous, and everyone had been transported together, which eased Yang Kai’s mind. He immediately released his Divine Sense to probe around.

It was likewise a palace-like space, empty and bare—nothing around—which made him breathe easier.

His choice of the black Spatial Array Gate was not solely because Yang Yan favored black; Yang Kai had his own considerations. Although traveling with many experts increased safety, one could never know what lay beyond two gates; any choice might be acceptable.

Moreover, the two Formation Masters could be of great use here; since they had entered the black gate, Yang Kai was naturally willing to follow.

That way they would not be rendered helpless if they fell into some array.

"Quiet!" the old woman snapped, interrupting Du Sisi’s accusation of Cai He. After narrowing her eyes at the girl, she turned to Yang Kai and asked, "Where are the others?"

"They all went to the other side; I was the last to come through." Yang Kai looked about and did not see Lian Guang’s figure, realizing he must have gone into the opposite gate.

The old woman’s expression shifted; she had not expected to be separated from the others. Glancing at Yang Kai and the three juniors, a wave of sorrow rose in her—here and now her strength was supreme; if danger arose it would fall to her to deal with it, and the burden pressed upon her like a mountain.

But thinking of the power of Yang Kai’s Artifact Spirit, the old woman relaxed a little. She did not expect much from the two Formation Masters in combat; Yang Kai, however, could be a significant help.

After a moment’s thought she said, "Never mind what’s happening over there; Du girl, I think our choice was not wrong."

Du Sisi, cowed by the old woman, dared not scold Cai He for acting on his own and bringing her this way, but she still muttered in displeasure, "How can you be sure?"

"At least this place is safe. Over where City Lord Fei and the others are, it might not be so peaceful. Don’t blame Cai kid—he meant well."

"Oh." Du Sisi nodded reluctantly, inwardly still unconvinced and feeling that following the majority of experts would have been safer.

The old woman frowned, pondered a moment, and then looked to Yang Kai, asking, "Young friend Yang, what do you think we should do now?"

She actually sought Yang Kai’s opinion.

Yang Kai chuckled and cupped his fist. "You flatter me, Senior. I am young and my knowledge is shallow compared to yours. Command as you see fit and I will obey."

Those words pleased the old woman; her wrinkles creased into a broad smile as she said, "Very well, let us leave this place first and then discuss."

Cai He and Du Sisi had no objections, and so the three Saint King Realm juniors followed the old woman out of the sealed palace. The moment they stepped outside they brightened.

The exterior resembled the ancient ruin they had entered before: flowerbeds scattered about, rare and exotic blooms growing strong, but the scene differed slightly from before—here there were also numerous ornamental rockeries.

Yang Kai’s nostrils twitched as a look of surprise crossed his face.

The old woman and the two Formation Masters had noticed too; they exchanged looks and could see excitement mirrored in each other’s eyes.

For a pleasant fragrance wafted through the air—no illusion, but real scent—meaning the source must contain something valuable.

At that thought every heart grew hot with desire.

"I suppose you noticed it too!" the old woman smiled faintly. "Come, let us go and see what treasure lies here, but be cautious so we do not fall into any array or restriction."

The others agreed and followed behind the old woman toward the scent’s source.
