## Chapter 1197 — Evolution of the Warm Spirit Lotus

After the Warm Spirit Lotus devoured so much of the golden energy, its six-colored radiance kept flickering incessantly, as if with just a bit more consumption it might evolve.

This left Yang Kai feeling rather regretful; he knew full well how difficult it was for the Warm Spirit Lotus to evolve.

When he first obtained this heaven-and-earth treasure that nurtures Divine Sense, the Warm Spirit Lotus was only five-colored. Later, even after consuming so many pills to enhance Divine Sense power, it showed no change; it was only after taking a pill that bore a Pill Cloud — a Saint-Grade Upper-Level pill with over a thousand years of history — that the Warm Spirit Lotus finally leapt to six colors.

As for getting it to its final seven-colored form, Yang Kai had never really held out much hope before; he thought that if it could reach that goal within his lifetime it would already be more than enough.

But now, this lofty goal actually showed signs of being within reach, which left him excited and expectant, yet also a little wistful.

He had already been considering whether, once the Flowing Flame Sandland closed this time, he should refine some pills to increase his Divine Sense cultivation and take them desperately to help the Warm Spirit Lotus evolve.

How much he himself could absorb from taking pills wasn't the point; as long as it could help the Warm Spirit Lotus, it would be fine — even if it cost countless Saint Crystals or wasted many pills, it would be worth it.

After indulging in these private daydreams for a while, Yang Kai's mood brightened.

He eagerly anticipated what help the Warm Spirit Lotus would bring once it reached its final form. In the past, with his low level, although he could feel the various benefits of the Warm Spirit Lotus, he didn't fully understand them; now, as his realm rose, Yang Kai increasingly realized how important the Warm Spirit Lotus was.

He had never deliberately practiced Divine Sense power, yet his Divine Sense could far outstrip that of peers in the same rank. Eight-tenths of that was thanks to the Warm Spirit Lotus, and of course the World-Ending Demon Eye also deserved credit.

Without the World-Ending Demon Eye, he couldn't ravenously devour others' insights into the Dao of martial cultivation, couldn't make his understanding of realms free of bottlenecks, nor let his Divine Sense cultivation grow so wantonly.

Putting those thoughts aside for the moment, Yang Kai took something out of his Spatial Ring.

The item was the unknown object that had jabbed him in the pool; at the time Yang Kai hadn't had a chance to investigate and had simply tossed it into the Spatial Ring. Only now did he discover that it was a six-sided, crystal-clear gem about the size of an egg.

It looked like a perfect piece of jade.

But other than being pretty, there was nothing remarkable. When Yang Kai first touched it in the pool, there had been a faint warmth. Also, a trace of yin-cold energy had seeped from it and flowed into Yang Kai's body.

But now it was utterly mundane. Yang Kai could not sense any energy emanating from within it. Frowning and observing for a long time, a layer of Demonic Flame appeared on his hand; the flame rolled and slowly enveloped it, but no matter how he scorched it, it showed no change at all.

This greatly delighted Yang Kai — his current Demonic Flame could repel even ordinary Origin-Grade Secret Treasures, let alone a completely unremarkable stone.

Unable to feel any energy fluctuations and with the Demonic Flame unable to burn it, Yang Kai tried to probe it with his Divine Sense.

But as soon as his Divine Sense threads touched this six-sided colorless crystal, it suddenly vanished from his hand.

At the same time, a refreshing sensation spread through his mind.

Yang Kai's expression shifted slightly; he hurriedly sent his spirit into his Sea of Consciousness.

Inside the Sea of Consciousness, a fiery red ocean roiled, the Six-Colored Treasure Isle's six-hued mists blazing brilliantly, and in the sky above the Sea of Consciousness, a six-sided colorless crystal had appeared at some point — it was the very one he'd held earlier.

Yang Kai's eyes nearly bulged out of his skull.

As far as he knew, the Sea of Consciousness was an intangible existence. Even if one were to split open a cultivator’s skull, its presence could not be seen with the naked eye. This formless ocean could not be entered by any external object—except for certain Divine Soul Secret Treasures.

The World-Ending Demon Eye could barely be considered a Divine Soul Secret Treasure, while the Warm Spirit Lotus was a Heaven and Earth treasure that nourished Divine Sense — neither of them belonged to this category.

But what was this six-sided colorless crystal that, the moment he probed it with Divine Sense, had entered his Sea of Consciousness?

However, it seemed that nothing was amiss; it only brought an unimaginably refreshing, entirely harmless sensation.

Yang Kai had been about to investigate further — after all, whoever found such a strange thing in their Sea of Consciousness would be greatly unsettled.

Before he could act, the Six-Colored Treasure Isle suddenly shimmered, its mists transforming into six-colored beams that shot over from an extremely distant place like a multicolored ribbon; they bound the six-sided colorless crystal and, to Yang Kai's dumbfounded gaze, dragged it back onto the isle.

The Six-Colored Treasure Isle shimmered and writhed, reverting to the true form of the six-colored Warm Spirit Lotus, the variegated light quickly withdrawing.

With a thought, Yang Kai's Spirit Body appeared above the six-colored Warm Spirit Lotus. Looking down as he had expected, the colorless crystal lay quietly on the lotus bud, refracting the Warm Spirit Lotus's six colors into a dazzling profusion.

Then the petals folded toward the center like an open hand closing into a fist, and soon transformed into a bud, appearing like a lotus about to bloom.

Yang Kai's face changed repeatedly; even his Spirit Body trembled with excitement.

Although he didn't fully understand what was happening, as the Warm Spirit Lotus's owner he could tell that the lotus had begun evolving toward its final form!

His earlier plan to refine pills to nourish the Warm Spirit Lotus was now unnecessary.

And it was precisely that six-sided colorless crystal that had triggered this change!

When the Warm Spirit Lotus evolved last time, nothing like this happened — its colors had only increased gradually as it was nourished by massive amounts of energy.

But this time, before evolution, it actually formed into a bud; Yang Kai could almost foresee that once the bud fully unfolded it would become the seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus in its final form, undergoing a complete rebirth.

What exactly that crystal was, it seemed even more potent than the golden energy contained in the Soul Cleansing Divine Water; otherwise how could it so dramatically provoke the Warm Spirit Lotus?

Yang Kai was elated; a smile he couldn't wipe off bloomed on his Spirit Body's face. The surge of his mood made the fiery Sea of Consciousness roll up dozens of zhang-high waves like a volcanic eruption, fearsomely majestic.

After a long while Yang Kai managed to suppress his excitement and fixed his gaze on the Warm Spirit Lotus's bud, finding ring after ring of vivid halos spreading outward from the lotus throughout his Sea of Consciousness; the halos expanded with an extremely regular rhythm, like a heartbeat.

With each ripple of the halos, subtle changes occurred in his Sea of Consciousness; the already crimson waters became denser and purer, their stored firepower more ferocious. The medicinal effects of the Soul Cleansing Divine Water that had previously entered the sea but not yet been refined by Yang Kai began at that moment to dissolve and fully integrate into the Sea of Consciousness, strengthening Yang Kai's Divine Sense.

Yang Kai's eyes lit up; the Warm Spirit Lotus was still evolving and was already benefitting him, which made him all the more impatient to see what it would look like when evolution completed.

Although Yang Kai wanted to stay a while longer, he couldn't help frowning with displeasure because the portion of his spirit left outside sensed several people approaching his direction.

With no choice, he withdrew his Spirit Body from the Sea of Consciousness.

Silently sending out his Divine Sense to discover who was approaching, Yang Kai was momentarily stunned.

The people were, to his surprise, the beautiful woman he'd spoken with briefly in the stone chamber and several of her companions.

All five of the beautiful woman's party had cultivation at the Second or Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; Yang Kai didn't know which power they hailed from, but for so many to enter at once, that power was certainly no small family or minor sect — it must be fairly substantial.

Why was she following him? Surely she wasn't thinking to take advantage of his being outnumbered and weak in cultivation with some ill intent?

A cold glint flashed in Yang Kai's eyes as he deliberately paid attention to their movements.

Throughout the Flowing Flame Sandland, cultivators' Divine Sense was heavily suppressed. Although Yang Kai was also suppressed, his baseline was much higher than that group's, so he could easily monitor them without being detected.

Muffled conversation drifted over.

"Senior Sister Shen, what do we need to go after that guy for? He's only a First Stage Saint King cultivator, pitifully low in realm; having him join offers us no help at all and will only drag us down," a pockmarked man asked, his face showing reluctance.

"Yeah, Senior Sister Shen, that guy clearly has no skill. Who knows which small family he's from — with such low strength he somehow has the qualifications to be here; it looks like that family must have no stronger cultivators," another said.

"Besides, if we let him join, any good finds would have to be shared with him — it's not worth it."

The four men and women trailing the beautiful woman didn't understand why she wanted to bring Yang Kai along; they thought she was having a moment of charity and wanted to help someone, but this was the Flowing Flame Sandland — you can help others anywhere else, but not here. Danger was everywhere; a single mistake could cost a life. They were busy surviving and had no energy to look after anyone else.

When the four had finished speaking, the beautiful woman sighed softly, her crimson lips parting as she gently said, "You all think his realm is low and that he has no ability, don't you?"

"Yeah, isn't that obvious? Could he be playing possum to spring a tiger?" the pockmarked man said, eyes widening as he considered a possibility.

"That shouldn't be the case," the beautiful woman shook her head.

"If so, then why bring him along?"

"Heh heh, you all know he has no skill, but why was he able to come here? And how did he manage to pass through the Heat-Flame Zone?"
