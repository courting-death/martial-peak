## Chapter 811 — Huasheng Pool

The yao are not skilled at pill refinement or forging, but they are not short on resources; spiritual herbs and medicines are swallowed whole by demonic beasts, and the rare ores are treated with indifference. If those materials were properly utilized, their power could rise dramatically.

Although that Great Yao Lord initially spoke with firm resolve, declaring he would not meddle in human affairs, Yang Kai still caught something interesting between the lines of his words.

He wanted his people to go to the Nine Peaks to cultivate using the dense Spiritual Qi there, but Yang Kai’s proposed terms alone were insufficient to sway him.

In other words, this fellow is the sort who won’t act without clear gain. As long as the rewards are ample, his stubbornness counts for nothing.

That was why Yang Kai seized the opportunity to suggest leaving behind the alchemists and artificers from the Sacred Land.

Sure enough, the Great Yao Lord was tempted, though still somewhat hesitant.

Yang Kai chuckled, “There’s a vein of crystal stone in the Nine Peaks. Before we return, you may mine it to your heart’s content—whatever crystal stone you extract is yours.”

The Great Yao Lord’s brows lifted; he eyed Yang Kai with amusement. “All the proposals you offer are clearly in the interest of my yao. Why? You’re not simply asking us to guard your place out of goodwill, are you?”

“Mainly because there’s a place I want you to protect,” Yang Kai said after a pause. “If the Nine Peaks fall into the wrong hands, they might destroy that place… and that’s not something I want to see.”

“That place must be important to you.”

“You could say that, but to you and the other yao experts it holds no value.” Yang Kai nodded.

“You’re so sure that once we occupy it we’ll hand the Nine Peaks back when you return?” the Great Yao Lord asked with a teasing look. “Perhaps we’ll simply make it our permanent territory!”

“If I dare ask you to help guard it, I have confidence I can take the Nine Peaks back when I return,” Yang Kai said firmly. “Besides, friendly ties with the Sacred Land also benefit you. In time we can trade favors like before.”

“We’ll see how you retrieve the peaks from my hands then!” the Great Yao Lord sneered, his smile turning wicked. “If you still lack the qualifications to earn my favor by then, don’t speak of the Nine Peaks—I'll take your life instead!”

“So you agree?” Yang Kai grinned.

“Pleasure doing business.” The Great Yao Lord inclined his head. Everything Yang Kai offered was essentially a free gift to them; why wouldn’t he agree?

Although entering human territory carried some risk, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land sits on the edge of human lands, and with a power like him stationed there, it was unlikely any foolhardy human would assault them; they could simply develop the Nine Peaks in peace.

In his estimation, Yang Kai would need at least equal strength to reclaim the Nine Peaks from him.

That would be a matter for an unknown number of years in the future.

Perhaps centuries! The Great Yao Lord would not believe Yang Kai’s boast that in merely twenty or thirty years they could be equals.

Over centuries their people could attain unimaginable growth, and the crystal veins in the Nine Peaks could be exhausted.

They might even have the Sacred Land’s alchemists and artificers teach their people to refine pills and forge artifacts, eliminating the need to rely on outsiders.

Such delightful prospects flashed through the Great Yao Lord’s mind, instantly making the deal seem worthwhile.

Of course, to enter the Nine Peaks they would first have to help the Sacred Land expel those enemies—this point the Great Yao Lord understood.

At that moment, Caidie, who had been waiting outside, suddenly entered with a grave expression. She didn’t glance at Yang Kai and said in a low voice, “Great Yao Lord, something’s wrong at the Huasheng Pool!”

The Great Yao Lord’s face darkened; he rose at once and hurried outside, Caidie following closely behind.

They seemed to have forgotten Yang Kai entirely.

Not long after, Yang Kai heard the rustle of figures moving across the ancient trees as the yao experts hurried downward.

Yang Kai stood with a puzzled look, then followed their direction and leaped down himself.

He had always been curious about the Huasheng Pool unique to the yao—what mysterious power within could transform beasts into human form?

Although approaching a yao stronghold so boldly might displease their experts, Yang Kai decided to see for himself.

Opportunities to witness such things were rare.

The Huasheng Pool wasn’t far from Thundertree Palace—only a short dozen or so li. In that mountain hollow, a world-shaking energy fluctuation now radiated outward; the sky above shimmered with ever-shifting colors.

Waves of agonized beast-roars came from there, stirring Qi and blood in the chest and causing a choking unrest.

When Yang Kai arrived near the Huasheng Pool, countless demonic beasts and yao experts had already gathered.

Each watched the hollow with deep worry, their faces pale with tension.

Even Yang Kai, a human, drew no attention.

Standing among the beasts, Yang Kai glanced toward the hollow and his eyes brightened.

There, in one spot of the hollow, was a deep pit some thirty zhang across. An unknown liquid flowed within it, and all manner of profound energies radiated from it.

This must be the yao’s Huasheng Pool.

Inside the pool lay a crystalline, snow-white demonic beast with twin antlers like a tame deer; the energies in the liquid flowed through its body, altering its bones and flesh, but something had gone wrong and it writhed in unbearable pain.

At the pool’s edge the Great Yao Lord stood, surging Yao Yuan pouring from his body and spreading outward as if to aid the beast in assuming human form.

Yet the effect was minimal.

Around the Huasheng Pool the ground occasionally flashed with bright energy lines like the circuits of some deep, intricate formation.

Yang Kai frowned, puzzled.

He had heard the yao didn’t understand formations, so how had formations been laid around the pool? And judging by the Great Yao Lord’s methods, he too seemed ignorant of formations—his yao yuan flowing out clashed with the flashing energy lines—so even with his fine cultivation he could do little.

“Hey, what are you doing here?” A small figure suddenly flitted beside him, a fresh fragrance wafting in.

Yang Kai turned and found a young-looking yao expert standing at his side.

It was the cat-eared girl who had watched his fight with Kuang Shi; she stared at Yang Kai with interest, her pale blue, gem-like eyes full of curiosity, a smile curving her lips, and a tiny tiger tooth making her look particularly charming.

“Hello.” Yang Kai cupped his fist and explained with a smile, “I heard a commotion and came to see.”

“You’re bold to come here—be careful, they might tear you to pieces.” The cat-eared girl gestured as if she could really shred him.

“They wouldn’t, would they?” Yang Kai’s face darkened at the remark.

The cat-eared girl laughed like a silver bell and teased, “You’re scared!”

“You tricked me.” Yang Kai immediately saw through her ploy and pouted. “What’s going on here?”

The question seemed to touch a sore point; the girl’s smile faded and she sighed, “Poor Baiyu Deer—something went wrong during its transformation, it’s probably failing.”

“What went wrong?”

“I don’t know.” The cat-eared girl shook her head slowly. “When I transformed I also had trouble; back then the Great Yao Lord helped me, otherwise I would’ve failed too.”

“Are the consequences severe? Why do you all look so worried?”

“Very severe!” she nodded rapidly. “This isn’t a failure from lack of comprehension; if transformation fails due to the Huasheng Pool, whereas a personal failure would leave one unchanged, this kind of failure could cost one’s life.”

“Because of the Huasheng Pool?”

“Yes, it’s happened several times—those folk all died…” The cat-eared girl looked mournful.

“You wretched thing, what are you doing here?” At that moment a sharp voice rang out as Caidie rushed over to Yang Kai and the cat-eared girl, shielding the latter and glaring at Yang Kai. “Who allowed you to come?”

“Uh…” Yang Kai shrugged. “I just came to see.”

“Cat lass, did he do anything to you?” Caidie asked coldly, though she addressed the cat-eared girl behind her.

“No—he was just talking to me.” the cat-eared girl hurried to reply.

“Be careful with this human; he might do something bad to you.”

“What kind of thing?” The cat-eared girl was wide-eyed with innocent curiosity.

Caidie’s cheeks flushed and she said, “Grab you, give you a good beating, then not feed you, let you starve!”

The cat-eared girl panicked and glanced at Yang Kai with some trepidation, as if that were the harshest torture imaginable.

“Hey, don’t slander me.” Yang Kai smiled wryly. “Do I seem like that kind of person?”

“You know in your heart!” Caidie sneered. “Because of the Great Yao Lord’s orders I didn’t act on you; you’d better be sensible… or I won’t hesitate to make you behave.”

Yang Kai sighed, “Fine. I’ll return to Thundertree Palace to wait for the Great Yao Lord to come back, and we’ll finish the discussion later.”

With that he turned to leave.

Having seen the Huasheng Pool, lingering here would only provoke annoyance, so Yang Kai chose to withdraw for the time being.
