## Chapter 2050 — Magma Cave

The medicinal herbs arranged in the grooves of the stone platform gave off no scent, yet their toxicity was so fierce that even Yang Kai kept gasping in surprise.

But if he wanted to leave this cursed place, he had to fulfill the small print requirement carved on the stone platform, so Yang Kai gritted his teeth and began tasting the unfamiliar herbs again.

It took him a full half day to sample every herb he didn't recognize, and even then he couldn't be certain whether some of them were poisonous.

The torments he endured were indescribable. Were it not for Yang Kai’s robust constitution and potent recuperative ability, the poisons would have either killed him outright or cost him most of his life.

Even so, he still could not gather the full count of fifteen.

“Why are there only thirteen?” Yang Kai stood before the stone platform, his brow knitting into a knot, his face full of bafflement.

If the owner of this cave had left such a riddle for entrants to solve, he certainly would not have set out to trick people; in other words, of these twenty-five herbs there must really be fifteen poisonous ones.

Yet Yang Kai had used sight, smell, and taste, and could only confirm thirteen as poisonous; no matter what he tried, the remaining two could not be identified.

How could that be? His gaze swept across the grooves on the stone platform again and again, but he could not find the remaining two by any means.

While Yang Kai stood helpless before the stone platform, every other martial artist who had entered this cave faced the same problem.

The warriors of the Blazing Fire Hall all cultivated fire-type arts, so the first stone chamber posed no real difficulty for them; like Yang Kai, they poured fire-type power into the platform and were sent to the second chamber.

Even Kang Siran passed the first chamber’s trial with ease.

And now everyone was stumped by the riddle in the second chamber.

In one stone room, a Blazing Fire Hall disciple stared at the twenty-five herbs and scratched at his head in frustration.

Not being an alchemist, he did not even recognize these herbs, let alone tell which were poisonous. After much looking he only picked out a few he was sure were toxic; the rest he could no longer distinguish.

As time kept slipping by, the Blazing Fire Hall disciple gritted his teeth and casually plucked a herb from the groove.

The moment he took it out, the entire chamber emitted a resonant hum; the stone platform before him suddenly sank with incredible speed and vanished in the blink of an eye.

The warrior’s face went pale; he hurriedly backed away, circulating his power to prepare for the unexpected.

A buzzing sound echoed, and points of light flickered to life throughout the chamber, densely covering the walls; a rough count revealed there were hundreds, at first glance looking like the eyes of beasts, chilling to the bone.

In the next instant those flickering lights trembled slightly and all rushed to strike him, releasing terrifying waves of energy that rolled out and crashed.

The Blazing Fire Hall disciple’s face instantly turned desperate; he only had time to bellow once before being overwhelmed by the countless lights.

After a moment, when the lights faded, the Blazing Fire Hall disciple had vanished from where he stood—only a pool of dark red blood and torn scraps of cloth remained to prove he had been there.

It was not only that Blazing Fire Hall disciple who met misfortune; all those who chose wrongly among the herbs triggered the chamber’s sealing and were killed on the spot in a single breath, leaving no remains.

In another chamber, Kang Siran withdrew an herb from the groove with a solemn expression, and after a moment passed without harm, breathed a sigh of relief.

Though not an alchemist, as the shopkeeper of a Spiritual Pill shop and a native Star Realm cultivator, his familiarity with herbs far exceeded Yang Kai’s—after all, he handled herbs every day.

So while the second chamber’s test held certain difficulty for him, it was not impossible to pass.

In yet another chamber, the Blazing Fire Hall’s deputy Hall Master Lian Yuming quickly and skillfully selected more than ten herbs at once, then after some pondering picked out a few more to reach the count of thirteen; the herbs he chose were exactly the same varieties Yang Kai had painstakingly identified.

Only two remained.

Lian Yuming’s eyes were like lightning as he rifled through the remaining herbs, searching his memory for what he knew of such plants; after a stick of incense’s worth of time he smiled slightly, composed himself, and withdrew the final two herbs from the groove.

When he took out the last two, the ground beneath his feet suddenly lit up and a teleportation formation rose, sending him elsewhere; at the same time the stone platform in the chamber slowly sank.

……

In the stone chamber, Yang Kai still wore a troubled look; he had once again carefully examined the remaining herbs but still could not determine which two were poisonous.

As he stood there baffled, suddenly he seemed to recall something and his eyes brightened.

He hurriedly took portions of the remaining herbs, combining them pairwise and grinding them together.

Soon, when he mashed two of the herbs together, a pungent, sharp spicy smell wafted from his fingertips, making his head spin, and his fingertips felt an intense burning heat.

Yang Kai circulated his profound art to dispel the discomfort, his face lighting up with joy as he laughed: “It’s you, no doubt.”

In this world some herbs were harmless by themselves, but when mixed with certain others they could become deadly; such knowledge wasn't limited to alchemical circles but was common in the lives of ordinary people.

Yang Kai had not thought of that at first, but the situation now proved his idea correct.

He confidently removed the two reactive herbs from the groove and set them aside.

The next moment a teleportation formation glowed beneath his feet, and after a flash of light Yang Kai’s vision went dark as a sense of being transported overcame him again.

When he steadied himself and looked around, he wore a matter-of-fact expression and nodded: “So it is!”

He found himself in yet another stone chamber, no different from the ones he'd passed through before; at its center stood the same stone platform.

By now Yang Kai had some vague guesses about the purpose of this place, and the various clues he had gathered earlier hinted at its nature.

He suppressed the excitement rising in his chest and stepped up to the stone platform.

Looking closely, he found three identical herbs arranged on the platform; from their scent they appeared to be of low quality, roughly Origin-Grade in rank.

Yang Kai brushed away the dust on the platform and, staring at the inscription, immediately understood the trial set by this chamber.

It required refining an elixir.

Once the purity reached a certain degree, the chamber’s teleportation formation could be activated.

Refining an elixir was nothing to Yang Kai; he had refined pills thousands upon thousands of times, and with his special Divine Sense Fire it was even easier to refine a liquid and strip away impurities.

And refining the liquid from a single Origin-Grade herb was not very difficult.

With that thought, he no longer hesitated and summoned his Divine Sense Fire to envelop one of the herbs.

After a short while the herb condensed into a droplet of jade-green liquid, impurities flew out one by one, and the liquid grew ever clearer.

Because he already had guesses about the various trials here, Yang Kai spared no effort and performed the refinement as perfectly as he could.

When he had refined all three herbs into liquid and placed them back into the grooves on the platform, the familiar teleportation formation rose again.

……

Over the following several days Yang Kai passed from chamber to chamber; each room’s trial differed—some tested the drawing of spirit formations during refinement, some required producing Spiritual Pills, and some tested control of refining time—tests of every kind, strange and varied.

Yet all of the tasks revolved around alchemy.

By then Yang Kai could be certain of his earlier suspicions.

This was absolutely Gongsun Mu’s test of later generations’ mastery of alchemy; he himself was a master alchemist, so it was not surprising he would set such trials.

As a generation’s master alchemist, he naturally hoped his relics would be gained by fellow alchemists rather than by irrelevant people; the many earlier tests were enough to determine whether someone was a qualified alchemist.

Perhaps Gongsun Mu even hoped to find a successor to pass on his legacy.

……

In a chamber Yang Kai placed a newly refined Spiritual Pill into the platform’s groove; after a moment the familiar feeling of teleportation came, the light flashed, and he vanished again.

When Yang Kai’s sight returned and he looked around, his face involuntarily brightened.

For the place where he now stood was finally not another identical stone chamber, but a corridor.

The corridor was bone-dry; farther ahead a faint firelight and a strange bubbling sound could be heard, and the scorching air gave the impression of having fallen into molten rock.

Yang Kai roused his power to form a protective aura around himself and advanced step by step toward the source of the firelight.

After a short time he entered a magma cave.

The cavern lay some unknown number of zhang below ground, seemingly natural with no traces of human workmanship.

Up ahead a crimson firelight shimmered; Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and saw it was a flowing pool of magma gathered into a basin, occasionally bubbling and bursting.
