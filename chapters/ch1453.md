## Chapter 1453 — Third Young Master Xue Yue

After all, this was someone who had died tens of thousands of years ago; the clothes he wore could not withstand the wind.

Not only that, but the skeleton itself was the same.

With a clatter, the entire skeleton collapsed, each bone crumbling into flying ash. Yang Kai frowned, and Saint Yuan burst forth from his body, wrapping up the pit in the ground to prevent the raging wind from rushing in.

It would have been one thing if the clothes had been reduced to powder and blown away, but he couldn't allow the skeleton to meet the same fate—if that happened, that elder would have no grave to rest in; how utterly tragic.

Saint Yuan struck out in waves as Yang Kai gathered nearby earth and used it to fill and cover the pit.

After a moment, he lifted his brow and stared blankly at a spot in the pit, a hint of puzzlement flashing across his face. After a long pause, he drew out his Golden Blood Threads and launched them forward.

When the Golden Blood Threads retracted, Yang Kai found a section of bone in his hand.

It appeared to be a segment of a thumb bone, yet unlike the other portions of the skeleton that shattered at the wind, this piece remained remarkably intact. Though no energy fluctuation leaked from within, as Yang Kai examined the phalanx closely his face could not help but show astonishment. He exclaimed, "This is…"

The thumb bone was covered with numerous intricate patterns and runes, as if something secret lay sealed within.

He poured a little Saint Yuan into it, but there was no significant reaction. Yang Kai looked puzzled, unsure what profundity this little bone contained.

Without probing further, Yang Kai carefully stowed it away and continued filling the pit with earth.

After a short while, a tomb mound rose from the ground. Yang Kai had no intention of offering prayers; after a glance he swiftly left the valley.

All he could do for that elder was this much, though the thumb bone could be studied thoroughly—surely the elder had sealed something inside that bone, which is why it survived tens of thousands of years.

Riding the wind like lightning, Yang Kai fixed his course and sprinted straight toward where the Imperial Garden stood.

Along the way the wind was calm and nothing unexpected occurred. Though the detour to the valley had wasted some time, compared to the enormous gain it was acceptable to Yang Kai.

He had resolved that no matter what else happened, he wouldn't meddle in any further affairs. He only wanted to hurry inside the Imperial Garden.

But the closer he got to the Imperial Garden, the more he could smell the scent of an impending storm; countless martial artists lay in ambush around the outskirts, intending to strike those who tried to enter or leave.

As time passed, Yang Kai even saw many combatants clustered together in brutal fights, the clashes fierce beyond measure.

Some tried to stop him, but Yang Kai brushed them aside with ease.

Thinking it through, Yang Kai immediately understood the situation.

According to Min Sha of Qingmu Star, the interior of the Imperial Garden was filled with peril upon peril. His group had only retreated because their losses had been too great, choosing instead to seek opportunities outside. The cultivators lying in ambush beyond the garden clearly knew what awaited within, and so chose to wait by the tree for rabbits—to rob any passing cultivators who came near.

That way they could easily gain some spoils without risking themselves—killing two birds with one stone, why not?

Hence the area around the Imperial Garden was shrouded in treachery and filth, killing intent everywhere.

Yang Kai had to exert considerable effort to break through that ring of ambushers.

Three days later, Yang Kai stood on a dirt slope and gazed at the vast, majestic palace ahead.

The Imperial Garden!

He finally saw the wonder of the Imperial Garden with his own eyes; this outer courtyard of the Starry Sky Emperor floated in midair, stretching seemingly without end, as if occupying tens of thousands of li.

The last time he had been inside the Imperial Garden his impression had been far less profound. Even from a thousand li outside now, Yang Kai could sense the primeval desolation emanating from it, an aura that made one feel as if standing within the ancient Great Wilderness, utterly unsafe.

Where was the entrance? Yang Kai frowned but quickly fixed on a direction.

Over there, multicolored lights burst forth and violent energy ripples rose and fell; in midair several small black dots were dancing up and down.

Clearly many people were fighting.

The closer one approached the Imperial Garden, the greater the chaos. The Garden's opening faced the whole Star Domain, so martial artists from many cultivation stars had converged and naturally clashed.

If Yang Kai's guess was correct, the fiercest fighting would be at the location of the Garden's entrance.

With that thought he didn't hesitate and flashed toward that side.

Half an incense-stick later Yang Kai had neared the battlefield. Observing the melee up close was shocking: at least several hundred participants were involved, most at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; occasionally a Saint King Realm would appear, but those were Third Stage Saint Kings brought here under the guidance of their elders.

Their clothing and equipment varied and their realms differed, yet they were all drenched in blood, slaughtering each other. Some sought to carve a bloody path into the Imperial Garden, some wanted to flee, and others merely delighted in chaos, murdering and plundering at random.

Screams rose now and then, blood spattering, and corpses tumbled downward from midair.

It was evidently impossible to pass safely through such chaos.

Yang Kai's face darkened; although his power was formidable and could contend with Third Stage Origin Returning practitioners, he had no confidence of passing unscathed through such carnage. One slip and he'd be drawn into the whirlpool of battle, helpless.

Yet when he raised his eyes he felt a burst of joy—just as he suspected, the entrance lay not far off. At that towering palace, a gate tens of zhang high yawned open, brilliant light spilling from within so that one couldn't see what lay beyond, only a mysterious allure that tempted martial artists to enter.

As Yang Kai hesitated whether to rely on speed and force to dash through, he suddenly sensed something and turned his head to look in one direction.

A resplendent azure rainbow was rapidly approaching; though not yet close, its overwhelming pressure crashed over like a storm tide.

Every combatant froze in alarm, ceasing their blows and turning to stare.

Moments later the azure rainbow reached the edge of the chaotic battlefield, its light fading to reveal six or seven hidden figures.

When their cultivation was perceived, everyone there changed color!

Among them were men and women, old and young, but only one was at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; the rest were uniformly Third Stage Origin Returning practitioners!

Such a powerful lineup might not sweep all before it, but it was far beyond what these scattered fighters could resist—these were clearly the elite of some major force.

Upon seeing their attire some cried out, "Hengluo Commerce Guild!"

Hearing that, the crowd displayed apprehension.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild was famous throughout the Star Domain, one of the few super forces that controlled several cultivation stars. They had over a dozen Void King Realm experts.

Rumor had it that the Guild's helmsman, Chairman Ai Ou, had reached the peak of the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, one step from the Third Stage.

That was an existence the whole Star Domain revered.

So when the Hengluo Commerce Guild's members appeared, the martial artists became obedient and dared not act rashly.

But Yang Kai's expression trembled as he stared at one among them; his heart raced.

The man’s face was as flawless as carved jade, his lips like painted cinnabar. He was tall and slender, his skin so pale it seemed to outshine frost and snow—such a description would not be exaggerated. A faint, courteous smile rested on his face, evoking an involuntary sense of warmth and closeness in anyone who looked upon him.

His realm was only the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, the weakest among them, yet he shone like the brightest star, surrounded by other experts like planets orbiting him; in their presence the Third Stage practitioners dimmed.

Any woman would be smitten by him, not only for his extraordinary looks but for an aura that drew like a bright lamp attracting moths.

Xue Yue!

In the Star Domain, the famed Hengluo Commerce Guild's Third Young Master, Xue Yue!

Yang Kai never expected that though he had failed to meet Su Yan here, he would cross paths with an enemy in such a tight place.

What a coincidence.

Yang Kai had been delayed ten days outside after the Imperial Garden opened before he arrived. Why had Xue Yue only now reached the Garden?

Yang Kai didn't know what Xue Yue had been doing inside, but he certainly didn't want to attract his attention.

There was a reason: Yang Kai and Xue Yue had a tangled grudge, and he knew a tremendous secret about Xue Yue.

The gallant, dashing Third Young Master who had enthralled thousands of maidens across the Star Domain was actually a woman!

If this news were to spread, who could tell how many young maidens would be left heartsick—and how many married women would weep in sorrow.

Their feud wasn't only that Yang Kai knew this secret. They had endured many untold, shameful encounters—for example on that Dead Star, when their clothes were torn away and they lay naked, bodies entwined yet murder in their hearts, each wishing to kill the other. In the stalemate Xue Yue used the Life Chain secret art to link their lives together and resolve the crisis.

Because of that technique Yang Kai had once been forced to find ways to save Xue Yue's life, suffering greatly and nearly perishing with her.

Although Xue Yue's impression of Yang Kai improved after subsequent contact, someone like her would never allow Yang Kai to casually spread her secret. If one day he accidentally leaked it, the consequences would be inconceivable.
