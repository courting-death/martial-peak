## Chapter 110 — The Heart of a Maiden

A sharp sword pierced through the chest—this was a fatal wound.

Yuan Lang could feel his heart suddenly contract, all the blood within his body surging outwards as his vitality rapidly faded. Struggling to turn his head, he finally caught sight of Yang Kai blocking the path behind him.

“Beast!” A strange expression flickered across Yuan Lang’s face, a mixture of unwillingness and fury as he glared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai remained silent, drawing the long sword from his chest, bringing forth a gush of warm blood, then suddenly thrusting it back in again.

Struck twice in succession, Yuan Lang could no longer endure it; his body went limp and collapsed.

His consciousness gradually blurred, and before death claimed him, a bitter smile slowly appeared at the corner of Yuan Lang’s mouth.

Truly ill-fated, a cruel twist of fate! He had thought himself to hold complete advantage by cornering this young lady in the mountain crevice, yet unexpectedly, he himself was trapped inside.

If not for this peculiar terrain, how could he have been killed without even a chance to fight back?

Even if outnumbered two to one, there should have been an opportunity to flee. But now, all was in vain.

The hunter, it seems, also has a day when he becomes the prey...

“Are you alright?” Yang Kai glanced up at Xia Ningshang.

In truth, Yang Kai had already arrived nearby when Yuan Lang discovered this young senior sister, but he had not acted immediately. Instead, he waited until Yuan Lang entered the mountain crevice and engaged Xia Ningshang in battle before launching his surprise attack.

This method was somewhat underhanded. After all, Xia Ningshang was unaware of the situation and had been frightened for a time, but it was the most efficient way to dispatch the enemy.

“I’m fine, you…” Xia Ningshang’s words faltered as she noticed the half-foot-long wound on Yang Kai’s abdomen and the blood hole on his shoulder.

At this moment, Yang Kai, drenched in blood, wore a calm expression tinged with concern, his gaze resolute. He exuded a steadiness and reliability unique to men, a stark contrast to his usual fragile appearance.

Bare-chested, he stood guarding the mouth of the mountain crevice. His slender frame was as immovable as a mountain, shielding against all storms and hardships, turning this narrow crevice into a warm and peaceful harbor.

Taking two slow steps forward, Xia Ningshang’s trembling hand reached toward the wound but dared not touch it, fearing she might cause him pain. Her eyes instantly reddened.

Only two hours had passed... What hardships had he endured outside to be reduced to this state? How much blood had he shed to appear so fierce and bloodied?

In this nearly isolated valley, facing a dozen or more hostile enemies lurking with ill intent, Xia Ningshang felt a profound bond of mutual dependence with Yang Kai. Seeing his grievous condition, how could her heart not ache?

Every maiden harbors a dream of a hero rescuing her.

Though the one who saved her this time was no great hero, nor a mighty warrior, but merely an ordinary junior brother at the Open Origin Realm, whose strength was worlds apart from her own, the heart of a maiden still could not help but stir.

“A minor wound!” Yang Kai said dismissively. “By the way, I found the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.”

“Oh.” Xia Ningshang wiped her eyes, but the expected joy did not appear.

“How exactly do we collect that thing? You should tell me now, right?” Yang Kai asked. “Otherwise, if we discover it later, it might escape again.”

“We won’t take it,” Xia Ningshang said, pulling Yang Kai’s hand and motioning for him to sit.

“Why not?” Yang Kai frowned. After all the trouble to come here, wasn’t it for the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew?

Xia Ningshang ignored him, speaking softly, “Sit down first.”

Yang Kai looked at her suspiciously but slowly sat down.

Lowering her head, biting her lip, Xia Ningshang half-kneeling before Yang Kai, tore a long strip from her dress, then took out a bottle and poured some ointment onto the cloth. With both hands, she carefully wrapped the wound on Yang Kai’s abdomen.

Yang Kai allowed her to tend to him.

“We’ll wait here until dawn,” Xia Ningshang whispered as she bandaged him. “After dawn, the Jiuyin Eight Lock Formation will collapse on its own, then we can leave.”

“But we came here to—”

“No,” Xia Ningshang interrupted firmly, her tone resolute and unwavering. “It’s not worth it for that thing.”

Yang Kai regarded her thoughtfully, frowning. “I know what you worry about, but I’ve already killed nine of them. Only two remain.”

“What?” Xia Ningshang suddenly looked up, disbelief shining in her beautiful eyes.

“There are two left, and we are two. What is there to fear?” Yang Kai’s eyes gleamed with madness. “Since they show no mercy, we need not be polite! And the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew—there’s no giving up halfway.”

“You’re lying to me, aren’t you?” Xia Ningshang looked at Yang Kai with innocent charm.

“Are you really that easy to fool?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly but winced sharply as he accidentally tugged at the wound.

“Are there really only two left?”

“Yes, just Long Hui and the one who injured you,” Yang Kai nodded.

Xia Ningshang was stunned. She had thought Yang Kai’s battered return was due to being chased and barely escaping with his life. Yet now he told her that in just two short hours, he had slain nine enemies!

Several of those foes were at the Separation and Union Realm.

How did he manage it?

“If... there are only two left, then we truly need not fear them,” Xia Ningshang’s delicate brow furrowed. “My only worry now is that after dawn, the True Yuan Realm expert will recover his strength. If he pursues us relentlessly, we may not escape far.”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow. “Once the formation breaks, can his strength really return?”

“Yes.”

“Then we have no choice!” Yang Kai’s expression darkened.

If they did not kill that True Yuan Realm expert before dawn, the two of them would surely be captured alive.

“But I’ve only recovered twenty percent of my strength. If we meet that True Yuan Realm expert, it will be troublesome,” Xia Ningshang sighed softly.

“I scavenged quite a few pills here. See if any can help.” Yang Kai produced the spoils he had taken from the dead, then searched Yuan Lang’s body.

Several bottles of pills were quickly secured. Yuan Lang appeared wealthier than the others, carrying far more pills and silver notes.

“With these Minor Recovery Pills, I should be able to restore forty percent of my strength. That will suffice,” Xia Ningshang’s face brightened slightly.

“You recover first. I’ll keep watch.” Yang Kai also needed to use this time to recover. Though his Yuan Qi was inexhaustible, his physical strength and spirit required rest.
