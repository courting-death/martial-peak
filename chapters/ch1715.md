## Chapter 1715 — The Fifth Star Emperor Token

The laws of Heaven and Earth were exceedingly profound; even Yang Kai, as the lord of Dark Star, could not break the sealing laws of Dark Star—so how would Ming Yue manage it?

Thus Yang Kai concluded that Ming Yue must have used some extraordinary method to draw upon Saint Yuan power.

Yang Kai was very curious about that method.

Ming Yue’s expression flickered with surprise but he showed no panic; frowning, he said, “You are not the Island Lord—how do you know this Island Lord cannot break the force of law here?”

“I just know.” Yang Kai smiled lightly, his face filled with certainty.

The look of full understanding on his face made Ming Yue’s expression darken; his attitude finally ceased to be so affable, and he snorted coldly, “Whether this Island Lord can break the laws or not, the fact that I can wield Saint Yuan is beyond question. Boy, you’re dead!”

“Big talk is easy—let’s see if you have the skill.” Yang Kai suddenly shouted, “Come out!”

As the words fell, a clear, bright bird call suddenly rang through the skies. With that shrill cry, a magnificent, blazing great Fire Bird burst forth from his body as if its whole form were aflame.

When it spread its wings, it nearly covered half the sky; a scorching profound intent instantly spread out.

Everyone stared at that immense Fire Bird in shock, feeling the dense power of flame upon it; faces went pale. Ming Yue’s expression likewise grew extremely grave as he discovered, to his horror, that this Fire Bird—though not corporeal and composed entirely of energy—contained not only fierce fire power but also ferocious thunder force.

Within that crimson body, dazzling streaks of purple light darted about like serpents.

Thunder and fire combined? Even with Ming Yue’s ample experience and wide knowledge, he could not at once determine the origin of this Fire Bird.

But that was not all. After the Fire Bird made its striking entrance, before Yang Kai appeared another simple, blocky Stone Puppet that looked as if it had been hewn from rock; the small Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao was endearingly clumsy in appearance, yet on its shoulder it bore a pitch-black, gigantic staff.

The giant staff contrasted sharply with that diminutive body, looking rather comical.

The little Stone Puppet gave a low, rumbling roar the moment it appeared, and with that roar its body quickly enlarged; in the blink of an eye it had become a Stone Giant some ten or so zhang high, a colossus that split heaven and earth!

The pitch-black staff that rested on its shoulder also grew proportionally thicker and longer.

Everyone lifted their heads to look up; an indescribable sense of oppression descended from the sky, making their breaths come short.

Ming Yue’s face finally changed; he looked at Yang Kai in utter terror.

“Deal with him!” Yang Kai ordered coolly.

Bird calls and beast roars echoed across Ghost Isle in an instant. The Fire Bird beat its wings and in a single moment arrived above Ming Yue; its imperial phoenix eyes looked down sternly, and when it opened its beak a bolt of thunderfire, like lightning split from the heavens, struck toward Ming Yue.

Ming Yue cried out in alarm. He dared not remain in place and immediately used footwork to evade.

With a thunderous crash the ground erupted in dust. A huge pit appeared where Ming Yue had originally stood.

Before Ming Yue could recover, the sound of hurried, heavy footsteps was already approaching.

Thud, thud, thud...

The Stone Puppet strode forward; its great feet struck the ground like mallets, pounding out a drum-like roar. From twenty zhang away, it had already swung up the Heaven-Shaking Pillar.

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar, weighing hundreds of thousands of jin, was like a toy in its hands with no trace of weight—yet the gale and explosive force it whipped up nearly hurled Ming Yue away.

Ming Yue’s face suddenly went pale. He snapped his fingers and a burst of light flashed; a pitch-black hexagonal shield appeared before him, spinning round and round and emanating an Origin-Grade Middle-Level aura—clearly of extremely strong defense. An ordinary Origin Returning Realm could not possibly shatter it with a single blow.

Ming Yue nevertheless showed no sign of relaxation; his expression grew even more serious. With a sidestep he exploded backward.

Boom...

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar struck that hexagonal shield; the shield barely managed an instant’s resistance before shattering into countless fragments. The Heaven-Shaking Pillar bore its irresistible might onward and continued to smash toward Ming Yue.

Fortunately he reacted quickly and managed to avoid that terrifying strike, but the remnant force of the sweeping staff still drove him into a sorry state: his garments were instantly in tatters, the gale slashed at his body, and dark red blood flowed from many places.

A deadly bird cry resounded above. Ming Yue looked up and his heart sank into the depths of a valley!

He found that the great Fire Bird had once again come to hover above his head; serpentine bolts of thunderfire burst forth from its body and enveloped the area where he stood, sealing off several dozen zhang in every direction.

There was no escape!

Lightning flashed and thunder roared, flames soared skyward—the dozens of zhang within that circle were instantly turned into a living hell. The entire Ghost Isle trembled.

Ming Yue’s several subordinates had long since lost the ability to think; they could only stare in horror as Ming Yue’s figure was swallowed by numberless bolts of thunderfire, each feeling as if they had fallen into an ice cellar.

Even the formidable Sha Hu shuddered in shock.

Only now did he realize that when he had been fighting Yang Kai earlier, Yang Kai had not been using his full strength—had he then unleashed those strange Stone Giant and Fire Bird, he might not have survived.

Whether Stone Giant or Fire Bird, either could have easily crushed him; the physical might he had prized meant nothing before these two bizarre beings.

Fortunately, his relationship with Yang Kai had not soured too far—they had even turned from enemies into friends.

Thinking of this, Sha Hu felt a chill run through him but also inwardly rejoiced at his wise decision.

Yet... what was Yang Kai’s true origin? With such tremendous power he could sweep across the entire Dark Star, could he not? After this, Sha Hu resolved to ask Pang Zhen about Yang Kai’s origins.

Sha Hu made that determination in his heart and his spirit drifted back to the battlefield.

Looking again, he could not help but utter a slight sound of surprise.

He noticed that Ming Yue, standing at the very heart of that hellish inferno, had not perished instantly — in fact, he still showed surprisingly strong signs of life. Sha Hu had no idea how Ming Yue had managed such a feat; if it had been him taking that strike, not even ten lives would have been enough to survive it.

Yang Kai had clearly noticed this as well, yet instead of alarm he looked on with interest.

After a short while, the thunder and lightning and writhing electric serpents and the sea of flames vanished; in the charred center of those several dozen zhang, Ming Yue stood panting, utterly disheveled.

At this moment, all trace of his former scholarly grace was gone. His robes were nearly in tatters, his hair disheveled, his skin scorched and blackened, and even the vitality within his body flickered unsteadily.

If not for his solid physical constitution, he would surely have perished.

That he could still stand owed much to his long-term use of Huntian Pill, which had tempered his body and enriched his Qi and blood.

But that was as far as it went. He stared at Yang Kai with a look of despondency, unwilling to accept his fate, and clenched something in his hand.

Yang Kai’s gaze shifted and he saw the true face of that object.

It turned out to be a token, and Yang Kai felt a strong familiarity toward it; from the token emanated a clear Imperial Might.

A Star Emperor Token! Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

He had never expected Ming Yue to have a Star Emperor Token in his possession.

Under Yang Kai’s perception, it was precisely because of this Star Emperor Token that Ming Yue could communicate with the Spiritual Qi of Ghost Isle, marshal his Saint Yuan and Shi field, and endure the Fire Bird’s ferocious assault without dying.

This ghastly place was somehow related to Yang Yan? That thought flashed through Yang Kai’s mind.

He no longer hesitated. In a flash he darted to Ming Yue’s side and with a casual palm struck him.

Ming Yue was at the end of his tether and could not resist; that palm became the last straw that broke the camel’s back—he looked on helplessly as Yang Kai’s palm descended with no power to fight back.

With a muffled thud, Ming Yue fell backward. Yang Kai was quick and plucked the Star Emperor Token and the Spatial Ring from his hand.

With his back to Sha Hu and the others, Yang Kai turned the Star Emperor Token over in his hand. He soon confirmed it was indeed a Star Emperor Token, for the few he already owned were identical to this one.

With his Divine Sense, he could faintly perceive that this Star Emperor Token seemed to share a subtle connection with a certain location on Ghost Isle.

Yang Kai looked up toward that direction.

“Elder Sha, handle the rest; I’ll go check that place out.” Yang Kai said, then vanished.

Sha Hu paused but did not pay much heed; he turned and sneered at Ming Yue’s remaining subordinates.

Only now had those men recovered; they cried out in terror, “Island Lord Sha, spare our lives! The events from a hundred years ago were forced on us by Ming Yue—we were not willing parties!”

“Heh heh, whether willing or not is of no concern to me. A wrong has its head, a debt its owner—you conspired with the scoundrel Ming Yue a hundred years ago to make life hard for me. If not for my luck, I could not have avenged myself today. No more talk—give me your lives!”

A crimson light flashed about Sha Hu as he charged at those warriors like a tiger on a flock of sheep; none were his match. In barely ten breaths, those men were killed under his palm.

With his great vengeance fulfilled, Sha Hu stood tall where he was and let out a long, thunderous roar toward the heavens — a cry that rumbled and rolled in all directions.

The thousands of cultivators on Ghost Isle all lifted their heads toward the source of that howl, their expressions shifting.

They knew the power structure on Ghost Isle had changed.

Near the center of Ghost Isle, in a small mountain hollow, Yang Kai strode in.

After he had entered, the Star Emperor Token that had belonged to Ming Yue began to buzz in his hand, as if it wanted to break free from his control.

The mountain hollow was pleasant; a few thatch huts had been built—whose residence they had been was unknown, but they were now empty.

Yang Kai looked around and his expression grew puzzled.

Although he felt something odd about the hollow, from observation alone he could not detect the truth of it.

After thinking a moment, Yang Kai released his suppression over the Star Emperor Token in his hand.

The Star Emperor Token shot out and traced a graceful arc in midair; as it flew, black holes suddenly appeared one by one in the void.

Those voids were filled with chaotic nothingness, and dense fluctuations of spatial power emanated from them.

Yang Kai’s face suddenly grew solemn.
