## Chapter 74 — The Debate on Sect Rules

As if rehearsed, as if connected by some unspoken bond, Yang Kai and Su Yan uttered the very same words, their tones and expressions mirroring each other perfectly.

Jie Hongchen was momentarily stunned by the outburst! He looked at Su Yan with agonizing pain and sorrow, lamenting, “How can he not be a waste? By status and rank, he is but a Trial Disciple. In terms of cultivation and strength, he is only at the third stage of the Open Origin Realm. Such a person is nothing but a waste. Sister, how could you possibly favor him?”

“Our affairs are none of your concern!” Su Yan had clearly stepped into her role, seizing this opportunity to finally break free from Jie Hongchen’s years of entanglement, even using the intimate term “we” to emphasize their bond.

“Senior Brother, have you heard of the saying ‘love at first sight’?” Yang Kai teased, fixing Jie Hongchen with a playful gaze.

“Shut up!” Jie Hongchen snarled fiercely, “When I speak to Sister, you worthless wretch have no right to interrupt!”

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, a cold sneer curling on his lips.

“A waste is a waste!” Jie Hongchen’s usual composure and grace had long since vanished, replaced by twisted jealousy and hatred that contorted his handsome face into something ugly beyond measure. “When I was your age, I had already reached the Qi Movement Realm. You are only at the third stage of the Open Origin Realm. Now I stand at the peak of the Separation and Union Realm. That is a difference of two entire Realms and six minor stages. How can you possibly compare to me?”

“Senior Brother, please wait and see!” Yang Kai said no more. Some things are useless to explain; only by accomplishing them can one prove their worth.

“Jie Hongchen, I do not wish to bicker with you here. Step aside. Thanks to your Law Enforcement Hall, he has been gravely injured. I must tend to his wounds!” Su Yan’s voice was cold and commanding.

“No one leaves here today!” Jie Hongchen roared in fury, his gaze filled with heartbreak as his body trembled slightly. He barked an order, “Law Enforcement Hall disciples, obey! Should anyone attempt to break through, kill without mercy! Even if it is your Sister Su, show no leniency!”

Such is the depth of love and the sharpness of hatred; in this moment, Jie Hongchen embodied this truth perfectly.

Rustle, rustle, rustle... After a brief hesitation, over a hundred Law Enforcement Hall disciples sprang into action, once again encircling Su Yan and her group.

“Are you determined to act this way?” A dangerous gleam flickered in Su Yan’s sharp eyes.

Jie Hongchen gave a bitter smile. “Sister, I know I am no match for you, but if you wish to pass from here today, you will have to trample over my corpse!”

He was ready to sacrifice himself, hoping to move Su Yan with his courage and recklessness.

Su Yan’s chest heaved with anger!

She was not afraid of the Law Enforcement Hall. Her own strength had reached the third stage of the True Essence Realm, three minor stages above Jie Hongchen. Once she unleashed the Ice Heart Technique, no one here could stand against her.

But... Yang Kai, Li Yuntian, and the others were destined to suffer.

After all, she was only one person. It was impossible to shield everyone under her wings.

The standoff froze the scene. Su Yan dared not lead her group in a charge, and the Law Enforcement Hall did not press forward, merely blocking their path.

While the younger generation clashed fiercely here, the elders of Lingxiao Pavilion were embroiled in a far more tumultuous dispute elsewhere.

Within the Elders’ Hall, the five great elders of Lingxiao Pavilion had gathered: Grand Elder Wei Xitong, Second Elder Su Xuanwu, Third Elder He Beishui, Fourth Elder Zhou Fei, and Fifth Elder You Zizai.

The five elders sat in two rows. On one side were Grand Elder Wei Xitong, Fourth Elder Zhou Fei, and Fifth Elder You Zizai, seated in the lower positions.

Opposite them sat Second Elder Su Xuanwu and Third Elder He Beishui.

This was the current factional alignment among the elders of Lingxiao Pavilion.

Wei Zhuang and Su Mu, who had been involved in the earlier conflict, knelt side by side on the floor below, reporting the day’s events in turn.

Su Mu spoke first, recounting every detail truthfully—how Wei Zhuang had blocked him, how he was provoked, the ensuing duel, and the humiliation he suffered. He told it all without a trace of personal bias.

The five elders listened silently, awaiting Wei Zhuang’s account.

However, when Wei Zhuang spoke, the story took a different turn. At first, his version matched Su Mu’s, but once Yang Kai’s involvement came up, Wei Zhuang launched into a tirade of slander. With florid words and theatrical sobbing, he painted Yang Kai as excessively cruel, brandishing a sharp secret treasure that pierced through his Xiuyun Chainmail and attempting to kill him on the spot.

His tone was so pitiful it moved listeners to tears, and his exaggerated gestures magnified the scene a hundredfold before their eyes.

“You’re talking nonsense!” Su Mu exploded in anger, unable to hold back his scorn.

“The facts are exactly as I say!” Wei Zhuang insisted, claiming Su Mu had been knocked unconscious and saw nothing of what happened.

“Facts, my foot! You’re a troublemaker, a liar, and a cheat! You don’t even bother to make your lies believable.”

“Enough!” The Grand Elder slammed his hand heavily on the chair. Su Mu had insulted his daughter-in-law in front of him—how could the Grand Elder not be angered? Yet, despite his fury, he refrained from punishing the juniors for their quarrel.

“Hmph!” The Second Elder snorted coldly.

The Grand Elder said, “We have heard all the accounts. What are your thoughts?”

Though he asked the question, his gaze remained fixed on Second Elder Su Xuanwu, clearly seeking his opinion.

Su Xuanwu replied, “What is there to think? This is obvious. The disputes among the juniors should be settled by themselves. There is no need to trouble the Elders’ Council.”

The Grand Elder smiled faintly and turned to Fourth Elder Zhou Fei, who had always been loyal to him. “Second Brother’s view is mistaken. This matter began as a simple sparring match between juniors, but once Yang Kai stirred up trouble, its nature changed.”

“How has it changed? In broad daylight, he openly challenged Wei Zhuang and did not violate any sect rules. Wei Zhuang was simply outmatched and defeated. Who else is to blame?” Su Xuanwu was incensed that his grandson had been humiliated and spoke with no small measure of indignation.

Fourth Elder spoke up, “If it were merely a challenge and sparring, and Yang Kai defeated Wei Zhuang, there would be no issue. But the fact is, during the fight, he produced a sharp weapon and used it to pierce through Wei Zhuang’s Xiuyun Chainmail. Sect rules clearly state that disciples may not use weapons during sparring! Yang Kai has clearly broken this rule and must be punished!”

Su Xuanwu sneered, “Fourth Elder, the sect rules do not say that, do they? Our sect leader has been absent for many years. Has someone dared to change the rules without authorization?”

His words carried a pointed implication, stirring unease among the Grand Elder’s faction. Wei Xitong responded, “Oh? Then Second Brother, please explain how the sect rules are written.”

Su Xuanwu sneered again, “The sect rules state that during sparring, disciples may not use weapons, nor may they use any pills or secret treasures that enhance their strength. Both parties may only use their own martial arts and unarmed techniques. Senior Brother, I have not misstated this, have I?”

The Grand Elder’s expression turned stern as he nodded, “You have not.”
