## Chapter 553 — Divine Sense Battle

The old man assumed a certain air of superiority over Yang Kai, laying bare the intentions of the Seven Great Families and the Yang Family without the slightest concealment.

This was precisely the reality of the situation.

The Yang Family’s indifference toward Yang Kai, dispatching only Yang Zhen and a few elders to negotiate with him, was exactly part of this plan.

From the family’s perspective, since the Seven Great Families all intended to seize what Yang Kai possessed, he would inevitably buckle under pressure and willingly return to the Yang Family’s protection—and the cost for that would be the method of enhancing martial prowess he carried.

Forced things never taste sweet. The family did not use force against Yang Kai, partly fearing his emotional backlash, partly because he had many experts at his residence, and also because the family believed that as a member of the Yang Family, one must dedicate everything to it!

Offering the method to enhance martial strength was only natural.

But returning to the Yang Family and having his entire strength nullified was a price Yang Kai could never accept.

The Seven Great Families were exploiting this delicate contradiction between Yang Kai and the family, stirring up turmoil between them.

If they could capture Yang Kai alive in this battle, that would be ideal; it was the scene they most wished to see. Then the Seven Great Families could negotiate with the Yang Family over splitting the hidden benefits that Yang Kai possessed.

Even if they failed to capture him and instead forced him back to the Yang Family, this outcome was also acceptable to them.

As the old man said, the Seven Great Families had put on quite a show with the Yang Family, losing many lives in the process. The Yang Family had to show some sign of goodwill; otherwise, how could the Seven Great Families ever let it go?

Yang Liting’s appearance today was precisely with this consideration in mind—to both apply pressure on Yang Kai alongside others and secretly ensure Yang Kai would not fall into anyone else’s hands.

Thus maximizing the Yang Family’s interests!

Listening to the old man, Yang Kai nodded slightly to himself, a sense of desolation rising in his heart.

This was the reality of great clans and large families; within the clan, one could not resist when faced with the overall interests. Faced with the family’s demands, one had to submit completely.

The old man continued, "Our original goal was this, but I have now discovered something far more interesting."

"The secret to instantly elevating oneself beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?" Yang Kai grinned, not a fool, naturally able to guess what the opponent coveted.

Tonight, Meng Wuya and Earth Demon each used different divine abilities to elevate themselves above the Divine Roaming Realm. This shocked all who witnessed it.

Meng Wuya might just be someone who naturally dwelled at that level, merely unsealing his true power—a method others could not imitate or learn from.

But Earth Demon genuinely used a secret technique to reach beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. If this technique could be obtained, it would be more valuable than anything else.

The Eight Great Families each had at least a dozen to twenty experts at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. Possessing such a secret method would allow them to gain an additional dozen or more experts beyond the Divine Roaming Realm in times of crisis.

What kind of advantage was that?

If the Ye Family got hold of this secret, crushing the Yang Family beneath their feet would no longer be a dream.

Even if Earth Demon’s method was brutal and ruthless, under the temptation of such benefits, nothing mattered.

Whether black cat or white cat, as long as it caught mice, it was a good cat.

"Interesting. At this moment, you no longer care whether the technique is evil or not?" Yang Kai sneered at the old man. "I was targeted simply because I have the potential to become an Evil Lord. Yet you covet the techniques Earth Demon demonstrated. What, you also intend to cultivate dark secrets yourselves?"

"Regardless of the nature of the power," the old man snorted coldly, unapologetic, "if it serves the family, it is a good thing!"

Yang Kai was astonished. "So you knew all along? I thought you didn’t, putting on that sanctimonious act just to suppress and destroy me. Don’t you find any of this ridiculous?"

The old man slowly shook his head. "When one stands in different positions, one sees things differently. Suppressing and destroying you is inevitable. If I must give a reason... it’s simply because you are too weak. If you stood where I stand, no one would dare to defy you."

"I understand," Yang Kai nodded lightly, his expression grave. "In the end, it’s because I have no power or influence."

"Exactly. Even as a scion of the Yang Family, you are just a mere child before us."

"Thank you for the lesson. I shall work hard—work hard enough that all can only look up to me and obey my will," Yang Kai said with a cold, mocking smile, a fierce flame blazing in his eyes.

"You have no chance," the old man said calmly, his expression cold and detached. "You might have had a chance if you hadn’t discovered my methods. But now that you have, do you think I will simply let you leave this place unharmed?"

"You want to kill me?" Yang Kai stared at him, showing no fear, instead some eagerness.

"I won’t kill you. If I did, how could I obtain the secret from that Demonic Master? For me, controlling you is far more valuable than killing you," the old man said lightly, as if speaking of trivial matters. "Don’t think you can leave here to give the outside world information. Since I’ve made a move, I will seal your Sea of Consciousness!"

"Who says I want to leave?" Yang Kai grinned wildly. At his words, the entire Sea of Consciousness began to stir turbulently. "You old dog, have you forgotten? This is my Sea of Consciousness. Here, I am the master!"

As the words fell, countless pillars of water erupted from the Sea of Consciousness, rushing forth in all directions like Jiao Dragons, striking at the old man’s spiritual form.

The old man stood serenely, appearing entirely unfazed by this devastating assault. At the moment the water pillars struck, he casually waved his hand.

With a splash, the water pillars were all blocked, and he himself was unharmed.

"Your Divine Sense is undoubtedly strong, but compared to me, you still fall short. I told you this before, didn’t I?" The old man sneered at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned, suddenly realizing that the old man had already infiltrated all his Divine Sense power without him noticing.

With his Divine Sense coalesced here, his physical body was likely powerless to resist.

However, the battle beyond the Divine Roaming Realm was raging; everyone's eyes and attention were drawn elsewhere, so no one was likely to notice his anomaly.

In other words, if Yang Kai did not deal with him here and now, the old man might really seize control.

Waving his hands, birds flying in the sky and fish swimming in the sea suddenly turned into sharp assaults, raining down on the old man.

The old man’s expression grew serious. Although his Divine Sense was slightly higher than Yang Kai’s, it was not to the degree of ignoring him. This Divine Sense attack—of the Second Stage of Divine Roaming Realm—was extraordinary, and he dared not take it lightly.

Invisible energy radiated from his spiritual form, spreading infinitely, meeting the aggressive birds and fish.

At this point, neither the old man nor Yang Kai held back. The battle within the Sea of Consciousness grew earth-shattering.

Fish glowed and birds fell like shooting stars. Yang Kai’s attacks proved hard to break through, but the old man’s expression grew grimmer as energy released from his spiritual form was continuously depleted. Yang Kai’s tenacity exceeded his expectations.

Whoosh…

On the Five-Color Treasure Island, the small sword-shaped Divine Soul Treasure of mystery-grade shot out, trailing a string of misty radiance, rushing forward. The old man’s face changed, unable to stay calm.

Though only an upper-level Heaven-Grade item, the Divine Soul Treasure specialized in Divine Sense attack and was the old man’s greatest bane.

Yang Kai unleashed it against him, a threat the old man could not ignore.

From the old man’s body radiated strands of visibly green Divine Sense power, instantly weaving an unbreakable net before him, aimed directly at the little sword.

The net was tough; the little sword struck it but failed to break through immediately, as if sinking into mud, drastically slowing down.

Seeing this, the old man barked coldly, “Yang Family brat, surrender! For me to personally take action is already a great courtesy to you. Don’t refuse the offered wine, only to be forced to swallow the bitter cup instead!”

"Save your boasting!" Yang Kai retorted coldly. "If you had the means to control me, why waste words?"

The old man’s expression darkened. Though reluctant to admit it, Yang Kai was right.

Before infiltrating Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, he hadn’t expected his Divine Sense so formidable, causing his plan to be delayed.

As he spoke, Yang Kai beckoned with his hand, and the little sword, trapped in the net, swiftly flew over and was grasped by him. He poured Divine Sense into it, and the few-inch blade suddenly erupted with blinding sword light.

Brandishing the small sword, Yang Kai grinned fiercely and dashed directly at the old man. Before he even arrived, he swung the sword down sharply, and a sword light several dozen zhang long shot from the tip, striking toward the old man.

The old man’s face changed. "Are you mad?"

In their previous clashes, both sides had only collided with their Divine Sense powers. Though draining, it caused no physical harm. But if the spiritual body were damaged, it would be a grave injury.

At worst, one would become a fool, their spirit grievously harmed; at worst, they would die on the spot, doomed forever.

So, seeing Yang Kai charging with a small sword in hand, the old man was taken aback. Who fought like this?

He hastily cast several defensive spells, but each was quickly broken through by the Divine Soul Treasure. Moments later, the two were face to face.

Though old in years, the old man’s instinctive fear of death remained.

Though yet to fight, his courage faltered, and he hurriedly retreated, putting distance between himself and Yang Kai.

"You old dog, all you know how to do is run?" Yang Kai pursued relentlessly, jeering continuously behind him.

This was Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness; here, he held absolute advantage. From the ocean below, successive Divine Sense attacks surged forth, blocking the old man’s escape routes.

How could he spare time for response?

"You just said you want to control me? Say it again so I can hear it," Yang Kai laughed uproariously, goading the old man, whose face was now ashen.
