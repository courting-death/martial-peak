## Chapter 797 — So That's How It Is

Each time Yang Kai deciphered and mastered a move of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique, the road before him grew noticeably broader; after cracking all nine, the whole Small Xuan Realm seemed to brighten, allowing Yang Kai to peer straight into the inner reaches of the Sacred Tomb.

Letting his Divine Sense roam once around, Yang Kai's face turned extremely astonished.

With Heaven-and-Earth Energy so dense here, he had assumed this Small Xuan Realm would span great distances, but only now did he realize it was at most the size of a single town—the smallest Small Xuan Realm he had ever seen.

For such a compact space to contain so much inexhaustible energy was baffling; there must be an energy source continuously feeding it, so that no matter how much an entrant drew, the supply remained unaffected.

The Sacred Tomb was filled with deadly restrictions that sent out covert energy fluctuations and dangerous auras; a careless touch would likely trigger terrifying attacks.

That Yang Kai could see through them all wasn't because his eyes were unusually sharp, but because of the nine divine moves he had just unraveled—the more he had broken, the more of the tomb's restrictions he could perceive.

Having fully deciphered the nine moves and ingrained them in his mind, he could, at a glance, penetrate the Sacred Tomb's hidden mechanisms.

Not far away, several ghastly white skeletons lay sprawled in a jumble; the flesh and blood on them had long since vanished, and even their clothing had crumbled into fine powder.

Those bones belonged to people from past generations who had entered the Sacred Tomb and failed its trials, dying miserably here; they spanned many eras and dotted the tomb—no fewer than dozens.

Besides them, great coffins lay silently in the corners of the Sacred Tomb.

The coffins were oddly shaped and varied in color, grotesque and overwhelmingly sinister.

Yang Kai quietly condensed True Yuan, ready for danger, and strolled toward the nearest coffin.

In a short while he reached it; the lid was ajar, and inside lay the neatly dressed corpse of a middle-aged man who did not appear very old.

Yang Kai raised a brow as his gaze was drawn to an ancient-bronze ring on the man's left hand.

He stood by the coffin for some time to ensure there were no tricks, then reached out and touched the ring.

If his guess was right, this ring should be the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring Xu Hui had mentioned.

Each outgoing Saint Lord took the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring into the Sacred Tomb when their time neared; the next Saint Lord's principal task was to retrieve that ring from within.

The ring governed the operation of the entire Nine Heavens Sacred Land; without it many places could not be accessed.

Judging from the condition of the corpse, the man had died not long ago.

It was undoubtedly the previous generation's Saint Lord.

A Third Stage of the Saint Realm expert dying at only three hundred years old—throughout the world, only the Nine Heavens Sacred Land would produce such a phenomenon.

Gazing at the man, Yang Kai couldn't help but sigh ruefully; if he were to become the master here, this would be his own likeness in three hundred years.

He snorted in derision.

Sliding the ring off the dead Saint Lord's finger, Yang Kai examined it carefully and shook his head; he could not tell how it had been forged, but it was certainly a Secret Treasure—hidden energies churned within the ring, and even after thousands upon thousands of years they had not waned.

The way those energies surged was peculiarly strange, vaguely following some unknowable pattern yet leaving no trace.

As he studied it, Yang Kai suddenly felt a devouring force emanate from the ring, like an invisible hand probing out, breaking spatial constraints and reaching deep into his Sea of Consciousness, making his soul tremble.

"Supreme Heaven Draw!" Yang Kai's expression changed; in an instant he recognized the energy bursting from the ring as bearing the mysteries of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique. He hurried to resist, but he was still a step too late; a faint ghostly glow flickered within his Sea of Consciousness and vanished.

The next moment he felt a subtle connection forming between himself and the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring.

His face darkened; standing rigid, Yang Kai glared at the ring in his hand, wishing he could destroy it outright.

Juntian Draw could pull out another's soul imprint and seize control. Yang Kai had once used it on An Ling'er without warning at the seabed, obtaining her soul imprint and thereby controlling her life and probing her thoughts.

But now someone had preemptively cast Juntian Draw on the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring and burned their soul imprint into it.

No thought was needed—Yang Kai knew it was the previous Saint Lord's last maneuver.

A measure planted by a Third Stage of the Saint Realm expert was beyond Yang Kai's ability to resist or dispel.

That meant he could not simply discard the ring; his soul imprint was inside, and if an enemy obtained it they would hold sway over Yang Kai.

He cursed; he had intended to bring the ring to Xu Hui in exchange for his freedom, but now the ring was effectively his and could not be handed to outsiders.

His mood plummeted.

Before he could recover, a vast, soul-chilling force erupted from the corpse within the coffin.

At the same time, coffins arrayed throughout the Sacred Tomb discharged comparable surges of energy that all surged toward Yang Kai.

It seemed Yang Kai had become the focal point drawing them.

In an instant Yang Kai felt his Sea of Consciousness's defenses torn apart as those energies poured in, throwing his awareness into chaos and giving him a splitting headache.

His face went ashen; he sat cross-legged without delay, plunged his mind into his Sea of Consciousness, and manifested his Spirit Body.

Inside his Sea, roaring and tumultuous waves raged—apparently the invasion had triggered a self-driven counterattack.

The waters boiled like a blazing inferno, surging into towering waves that battered the intruders; those invading energies seemed to fear the Divine Sense Fire and fled in disarray.

As they fled, layer upon layer of invisible mental fluctuations transmitted from those energies, striking Yang Kai's Spirit Body.

Yang Kai frowned in puzzlement, staring unblinking at the energies streaming into his Sea, and gradually his mind steadied.

The roaring waters calmed.

He saw that these energies were the lingering wills left behind by past Saint Lords—strictly speaking, their residual souls.

For some unknown reason, these souls had little consciousness now; they merely followed the last wishes set before death and mechanically completed their tasks.

They bore no wish to harm him, only continual waves of mental influence aiming to instill something into him.

Yang Kai cocked his head and deliberately opened his soul to receive what these remnants were trying to pour into him.

A moment later his expression turned strange.

Contrary to his expectation, they were not imparting mighty techniques or rare secrets; it felt more like they were attempting to brainwash him.

In that short span he found his view of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land shifting—staying here did not seem so bad. As Saint Lord one would hold great rank and authority, command thousands, and reach the Martial Peak far faster than toiling alone outside and tasting life's bitterness.

That thought loosened him, and those past Saint Lords' remnants felt suddenly familiar, making him inclined to hear more of their teachings.

With a chill in his chest, Yang Kai hastily sealed his Spirit Body, expelled those stray thoughts, and glared icily at the soul swirling near him.

"So that's how it is!" he sneered softly, his gaze turning hostile.

He had always wondered why the Saint Lords brought back by the Saintesses so readily accepted this place, even at the cost of shortened lifespans—now he understood: within the Sacred Tomb they had been guided by these lingering souls.

Were it not for his unusually powerful Divine Sense, he too might have followed their fate and become like them within a very short time.

The spiritual onslaught by the past Saint Lords carried a strong pacifying force; under its influence anyone who came here would feel acceptance and belonging toward the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and make it their life's pursuit.

Historically the candidates chosen to enter the Sacred Tomb never exceeded the First Stage of the Transcendent Realm, and their Divine Sense cultivation was naturally not very resilient. Yang Kai was different—his cultivation was not low, and his Divine Sense far outstripped his physical realm, granting him resistance to such manipulations.

Coupled with his unwillingness to be the Sacred Land's master, he immediately snapped out of that comforting haze.

Now that he grasped the secret, Yang Kai felt fearless. If these had been ordinary traps he might have been wary, but the residual souls of past Saint Lords should not be able to shred his Divine Sense defenses and invade his Sea.

In this world, he was the only true master.

He tried to speak with those souls but received no reply; the past Saint Lords had long since died, and though their souls somehow lingered, they had lost true consciousness and simply carried out preordained wishes.

The waves of spiritual assault continued unabated, laden with pacifying and seductive intent to shake his Spirit Body. Growing impatient, he shifted his mind and the World-Ending Demon Eye floating above his Sea slowly opened.

The golden pupil brimmed with unyielding majesty as it coldly watched below; in the next instant a golden radiance bathed everything.

With a crackling roar, the countless soul energies that belonged to Third Stage of the Saint Realm experts were purified in an instant.
