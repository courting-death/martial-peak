## Chapter 1978 — Soul Contract

Late at night, Yang Kai returned to his lodgings, his face clouded with gloom.

The day's errands had not gone smoothly; although he had visited many shops, those establishments either clung to their treasures, treating pill recipes as precious secrets and refusing to show outsiders, or quoted sky-high prices that left Yang Kai helpless, and the recipes they were willing to sell were obscure and practically useless.

The truly useful and popular pill recipes, they simply would not put up for sale.

Yang Kai naturally would not be a fool to overpay.

He could understand their conduct — every shop's recipes had been handled and refined by many alchemists, improved bit by bit, and amounted to their trade secrets; how would they easily reveal them to outsiders?

So he had to seriously consider Kang Siran's proposal.

The next two days passed without incident.

On the third day, Yang Kai went to the Spiritual Pill shop again.

It seemed Kang Siran had instructed ahead; when the shop assistant saw Yang Kai he immediately greeted him attentively, smilingly saying, "Sir, you're here — please come in; the proprietor is waiting for you."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and signaled for him to lead the way.

They entered the same side room as before; Kang Siran, seeing Yang Kai punctual as promised, broke into a broad smile, warmly invited Yang Kai to sit, poured him tea, then took a sheet of paper from a Spatial Ring and handed it to Young Master Yang, saying, "This is the list of pill recipes you requested earlier — have a look and see if you are satisfied!"

Yang Kai thanked him and took the list to browse.

But as soon as he skimmed it, Yang Kai couldn't help but brighten.

Because on that list were recipes for forty to fifty kinds of pills; as he examined them one by one, the one listed first was, to his astonishment, the very Origin Condensing Pill he sought.

And afterwards, although he already knew recipes for most of the pills, recipes were not immutable — depending on geography and differing local produce, one recipe could spawn many variants, and the Spiritual Pills made from them would have slightly differing effects.

So even for recipes he already knew, he could still borrow experience from this Spiritual Pill shop's versions to improve his own — they were not without value.

Of the forty to fifty recipes, only around a dozen or so were ones he did not have.

But this result already left Yang Kai extremely satisfied. He nodded, and set the paper down.

Kang Siran, with his shrewd gaze, had been watching him closely; he already knew Yang Kai had been tempted, and now asked, "Young Master Yang, are you satisfied with the catalogue I provided?"

Yang Kai smiled faintly: "Shopkeeper Kang, you are thoughtful — these recipes were not acquired easily, were they?"

Kang Siran smiled: "Young Master has sharp eyes; only a small portion of these recipes belong to our pill shop, the rest I obtained from some old friends and are not trade secrets, so Young Master need not concern himself."

"Your shop deals in so many kinds of Spiritual Pills? Does that mean if I refine here I need to make them all?" Yang Kai asked.

"No, no, no," Kang Siran hastily waved his hand. "Our shop primarily deals in the pills ranked in the top fifteen on this catalogue; we don't sell the others because few cultivators demand them and there's little profit. Especially the Origin Condensing Pill — it is our shop's top priority. I'm not boasting; our Origin Condensing Pill is at least ten percent better than the market's, and is much sought after by Fenglin City cultivators."

"Why is that?" Yang Kai asked, astonished.

He had already noticed that many who came to the Spiritual Pill shop to buy pills were seeking the Origin Condensing Pill, and those buyers were without exception of the Void King Realm.

Kang Siran beamed with pride, stroked his beard, and said, "Because our Origin Condensing Pill recipe was personally improved by Master Huangfu at headquarters!"

Then, as if fearing Yang Kai's ignorance, Kang Siran hastily added, "Master Huangfu is an Imperial-Grade alchemist, renowned throughout the Star Realm!"

Yang Kai was momentarily stunned by that revelation.

He finally understood why the shop's Origin Condensing Pill was so sought after — the recipe had been personally refined by an Imperial-Grade alchemist, so it was only natural that its effects were somewhat superior.

That, however, was good news for Yang Kai.

What he needed most now was the Origin Condensing Pill; refining pills with a recipe improved by an Imperial-Grade alchemist would greatly assist him, and perhaps even allow him to glean some hidden secrets from the formula.

"Heh heh, Young Master Yang, I'm being frank," Kang Siran said with a smile, and he no longer appeared so anxious — from Yang Kai's expression and tone he had already guessed Yang Kai would likely join the shop temporarily.

As expected, Yang Kai nodded and said, "It would be my honor to refine for your shop; for the next two months please take care of me, Shopkeeper Kang."

"Good, good!" Kang Siran laughed heartily; the gloom that had lain over his face for days was finally swept away.

The Spiritual Pill shop's situation had been tight — because the Origin Condensing Pill opened such a profitable market, customers kept coming; formerly three Void King-Grade alchemists had manned the place and barely kept up with sales, but when two were poached by the Commerce Guild's Danqi Pavilion, the last one worked overtime and still could not cover the demand.

Now the Origin Condensing Pill was in short supply, drawing complaints from many of their longtime clients.

Business depended on steady supply; once stock ran short, many customers could be lost, which would be a mortal blow to the shop.

At last, with Yang Kai's joining, though things would not immediately return to normal, they could at least catch their breath — they only needed to get through these two months until two alchemists were sent from headquarters, and then all would be well.

Kang Siran sobered and said, "Young Master Yang, I am a businessman, so I'll be frank — if I offend you, please forgive me."

"Please speak, Shopkeeper Kang!" Yang Kai replied.

"These recipes you may observe and copy, even transcribe, but you must not leak them to others, especially the Origin Condensing Pill. I require Yang Kai to sign a contract with me using a Soul Brand — will you agree?" Kang Siran asked.

"That is naturally acceptable," Yang Kai replied readily.

"Very good. Then please see if this contract needs any modification," Kang Siran said.

Kang Siran had prepared ahead and produced the contract from a Spatial Ring.

Yang Kai could not tell what material it was made of, but a faint ripple of energy flowed from the contract.

Yang Kai read it; the contract detailed both parties' duties and obligations, and especially emphasized the secrecy of those recipes — Yang Kai was absolutely forbidden to disclose them.

After a while, Yang Kai nodded and said, "No problem."

Kang Siran said, "Then Young Master Yang, please join me in branding this contract with our Soul Brands — that will settle everything."

He went first, releasing Divine Sense to brand the contract; Yang Kai had never done this before, but with Kang Siran's demonstration he learned quickly.

When both Soul Brands had been impressed into the contract, it suddenly ignited without flame; as it burned, a strange force split into two streams and flowed into Yang Kai and Kang Siran's Seas of Consciousness.

In the dimness, Yang Kai felt a mysterious restriction settle into his Sea of Consciousness — it normally had no effect, but if he prepared to leak forbidden things the restriction would retaliate.

"This is rather wondrous," Yang Kai thought to himself, wondering which expert had devised it; for businessmen it was undeniably of great help.

Kang Siran, knowing Yang Kai lacked experience, explained, "This Soul Contract was passed down from the Soul Palace; it was researched by the Great Emperor Youhun, one of the Ten Great Emperors. This Soul Contract can guarantee both parties' integrity. If Young Master Yang later needs to cooperate with strangers while traveling, he may sign such a Soul Contract — but it comes at a high price. One contract costs at least one hundred fifty thousand Lower-Level Source Crystals, and they are virtually unmarketable and extremely hard to obtain."

"So expensive!" Yang Kai was moved — at Biyu Sect he had only earned thirty thousand Lower-Level Source Crystals in a month, so one hundred fifty thousand represented five months' worth of refining, and might still be unobtainable.

"Heh heh, my own Soul Contract was obtained years ago during an adventure by chance," Kang Siran said with a pained expression.

Though reluctant to use his Soul Contract, Kang Siran had no other choice if he wanted to save the Spiritual Pill shop.

"Pillmaster Yang, please take care of things for the next two months," Kang Siran said, folding his expression into one of genial warmth as he cupped his fist and smiled at Yang Kai.

"Likewise!" Yang Kai replied.

"Since we've signed the Soul Contract, let's discuss remuneration," Kang Siran said as he sat down. The Soul Contract only guaranteed that Yang Kai would not leak recipes; payment had not been written into it and required detailed negotiation.

Just then, a knock sounded from outside.

Kang Siran frowned and asked sharply, "What is it?"

He had explicitly instructed that important matters with Yang Kai were not to be disturbed, so an inconsiderate assistant enraged him.

"Shopkeeper, it's bad — Pillmaster Fan is leaving our pill shop," the shop assistant outside called in a panic.

"What?" Kang Siran suddenly stood up, his face turning ashen and utterly shocked.

"Shopkeeper, please go look — Pillmaster Fan says he won't work here anymore."

"How outrageous!" Kang Siran hissed, rushing toward the door; then he remembered Yang Kai was present and asked, "Pillmaster Yang, will you come along?"

"May I?" Yang Kai asked.

"Of course; now you are no longer an outsider!"
