## Chapter 520 — You Cannot Stop Us

The Black Jiao, more than a dozen zhang long, moved slowly, causing many warriors to feel a surge of terror. Their attitudes toward Yang Kai began to change subtly.

The warriors from Yang Zhao’s mansion had originally believed that they could defeat Yang Kai and his group by sheer numerical superiority this time. But after witnessing the methods Yang Kai displayed, they immediately reined in their thoughts.

Such strength and depth of foundation were not something ordinary people could overcome. Even if they managed to defeat the warriors in Yang Kai’s mansion today, capturing Yang Kai himself was by no means guaranteed.

What comforted them somewhat was that neither Di Mo nor Tang Yuxian moved much after revealing their strength. It seemed their purpose was only to intimidate, not to commence a real slaughter.

Yang Zhao’s expression changed sharply as he shouted, “Ninth Brother, are you really going to start a battle here with Second Brother?”

As Yang Kai had said before, Yang Zhao’s worries were greater than his. Though he held an absolute advantage in numbers, his number and caliber of experts paled in comparison with those of Yang Kai’s mansion. Once a fight broke out, it would only lead to mutual destruction.

In the end, the one who stood to gain would be First Brother Yang Wei.

He certainly did not want someone else to take advantage.

Until he attained an absolute edge, he had no intention of confronting anyone head-on.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai’s overwhelming power this time made him realize that the succession battle would not unfold as he had expected.

“Second Brother, I told you, I only want to kill those two. If you hand them over, I’ll leave immediately!” Yang Kai shook his head slowly.

“Impossible!” Yang Zhao shook his head as well. If he really handed over Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng, what would he become? However, even from Yang Kai’s tone, he sensed that Yang Kai also did not want the battle to start here.

No one wished to suffer a mutually destructive outcome.

Yang Zhao feared being exploited by Yang Wei; Yang Kai did not want his friends to be endangered. Though their starting points differed, they considered the same complications.

After a brief pause, Yang Zhao suddenly chuckled lightly. “Ninth Brother, since you and I both have so many concerns, I have a suggestion. Care to hear it?”

Yang Kai frowned, uncertain what scheme Yang Zhao intended to play, but still nodded gently, “Speak.”

“Consider this event as an internal dispute among Yang Family members. Since it is an internal matter, only Yang Family members can participate. You want to kill; I want to protect—each relying on their own means. How about that?”

Yang Kai’s lips curled into a wry smile. “Internal dispute?”

“That’s right.”

“Only Yang Family members can participate?”

“Yes.”

“Including the Blood Servants, right?”

“Of course. Although the Blood Servants don’t share the Yang surname, they are still part of the Yang Family.”

“I understand.” Yang Kai nodded slightly, then suddenly looked up, eyes shining brightly. “Then we shall follow Second Brother’s terms! This time, this is indeed a dispute among Yang Family members.”

“Agreed!” Yang Zhao laughed out loud, as if some scheme had succeeded.

Yang Kai laughed too, a dark and mysterious smile crossing his face. Qiu Yimeng frowned tightly, sensing something amiss but unable to pinpoint exactly what.

At the teahouse, Yang Wei and Liu Qingyao shared confused glances, unable to understand what Yang Zhao was up to with such smugness. Even more puzzling was Yang Kai’s calm demeanor and utter confidence.

These two brothers—one believed he could protect Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu; the other believed he could kill them. No one knew who would get their wish.

Since the battle was restricted only to Yang Family members, Tang Yuxian and the Blood Servant beside Yang Zhao would inevitably clash. That left Yang Zhao’s opponent as Yang Kai. Now, although Yang Kai’s aura was fierce and brutal, with some signs of having entered the Demonic State, his oppressive presence and formidable power were undeniable.

Did Yang Zhao have the confidence to stop him?

Yang Wei and Liu Qingyao were skeptical. No matter how outstanding Yang Zhao was, he was no match for the current Yang Kai and would likely fall in fewer than three breaths.

“Yuxian!” Yang Kai suddenly shouted fiercely.

Tang Yuxian nodded lightly, her delicate body rising into midair.

The Blood Servant beside Yang Zhao smiled faintly and without hesitation ascended to meet Tang Yuxian.

The two Blood Servants engaged without even a greeting.

But no one paid attention to them. Though they were strong Divine Roaming Realm experts, today’s focus remained on the two Yang Family young masters.

“Ninth Brother!” Yang Zhao commanded harshly. Unexpected to all, faced with present Yang Kai, he chose offense instead of defense, slamming his foot hard into the ground.

Suddenly, several eerie straight lines bulged from the earth, as if beneath them, massive worms writhed rapidly, terrifying energy surging upward toward Yang Kai.

Earth Fiend Dragon Technique!

On the first night of the succession battle, Yang Zhao had used this Martial Skill against Huo Xingchen.

The Earth Fiend Dragons each formed from the soul of a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, stored within Yang Zhao’s body and wielded flexibly in battle. They often caught foes off guard, making defense difficult.

At that time, he could deploy seven Earth Fiend Dragons. Now, with greater strength, he could use ten, each far more powerful than before.

Yet Yang Kai’s expression showed no change. With a thought, the Black Jiao circling above him suddenly opened its blood-red maw, releasing wave after wave of dark energy.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

Each blast struck the Earth Fiend Dragons underground. Amid the dust and debris, Yang Zhao’s Earth Fiend Dragon Technique was shattered before it could deal any damage.

Yang Zhao did not care the least. A strange smirk curved at the corner of his mouth. Standing firm, his gaze filled with pride and pity, he said calmly, “Ninth Brother, you are finished!”

Hundreds of zhang away in the teahouse, Yang Wei and Liu Qingyao simultaneously turned pale. Exchanging glances, they finally understood what scheme Yang Zhao had been plotting.

Qiu Yimeng’s face also drained. In the dust cloud, she suddenly saw a shadow approaching Yang Kai’s back at an incredible and incomprehensible speed.

This figure appeared stealthily and inexplicably. By the time Qiu Yimeng realized and tried to warn, it was already too late.

“Second Brother, do you really think Ninth Brother doesn’t know what you’re plotting?” Yang Kai suddenly shouted explosively. The Black Jiao above surged like an arrow toward the shadow behind him, biting down before the figure could close in.

The person’s expression froze in shock, surprised that Yang Kai had fully seen through his movements. Sensing the Black Jiao’s oddity and difficulty, he dared not attack impulsively. Flickering a few times, he came beside Yang Zhao, focusing his gaze on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, remaining where he was, watching the pale-faced Yang Zhao indifferently.

“So, the other Blood Servant in the Second Brother’s mansion has already broken the Sealing Yuan Curse!” Yang Wei suddenly realized.

During the treasure battle at Po Jing Lake, each young master had a Blood Servant sealed with the Sealing Yuan Curse that suppressed their True Yuan. This was the doing of Grand Elder Huang Jiuzhou of the Yang Family. For a Blood Servant to break this seal by their own power required at least two months.

The Blood Servant in Yang Wei’s mansion had been in seclusion trying to break the curse for over two months and was nearly ready to emerge.

Unexpectedly, the Blood Servant in Yang Zhao’s mansion had already succeeded.

No wonder Yang Zhao made that proposal—this was the reason.

With Ying Jiu absent, Yang Kai was effectively facing Yang Zhao and a Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage Blood Servant alone! Outsiders saw no chance of victory.

“You knew all along?” Yang Zhao’s face twitched. He thought his scheme had succeeded, intending to eliminate Yang Kai outright, but Yang Kai had long suspected the concealed a Blood Servant.

“Of course I knew,” Yang Kai said with disdain, “With my mighty Divine Sense, no movement or presence in Yang Zhao’s mansion escapes me.”

“You knew and still agreed?” Yang Zhao stared incredulously.

“So what if I agreed?” Yang Kai replied arrogantly, shaking his head slowly, “You cannot stop us.”

His arrogance was extreme.

Everyone was stunned, their expressions strange, secretly wondering if Ninth Brother of the Yang Family had truly gone mad, no longer able to be judged by normal reasoning.

Yang Wei and Liu Qingyao at the teahouse were equally dumbfounded.

Facing a Divine Roaming Realm Eighth Stage Blood Servant, he still dared such wild talk?

He had to be vastly underestimating his own family’s Blood Servant!

Everyone felt a strange mixture of emotions.

The Blood Servant beside Yang Zhao looked grim, clicking his tongue. “Young master, though we Blood Servants all respect you, being looked down on so much like this doesn’t sit well. To prove my strength, I won’t hold back.”

“Then try and stop me!” Yang Kai laughed broadly, hands sweeping as an endless wave of black qi spread forward like a plague of locusts.

The Black Jiao suddenly released a loud, piercing roar, shaking its head and tail as it lunged at the Blood Servant and Yang Zhao.

Yang Kai no longer planned to waste time and struck with full force.

With such a violent assault, Yang Zhao immediately choked, feeling an irresistible force. However, the Blood Servant beside him suddenly erupted with boundless energy, a pure white light enveloping both him and Yang Zhao, protecting them.

Clang clang clang...

The black qi slammed against the white light. In the blink of an eye, the white glow was like clear water stained with ink—completely tainted.

The Blood Servant’s expression changed, evidently surprised by Yang Kai’s cunning. Taking no chances, he hurriedly dragged Yang Zhao aside.

But the black qi seemed to have eyes, pursuing closely, refusing to relent.

Another powerful dragon roar sounded. The more-than-ten-zhang-long Black Jiao had already reached above the Blood Servant and Yang Zhao, mouth wide open.

A violent and deadly energy surged out from the Black Jiao, centered on it and suddenly boiling over, spreading in all directions. The black qi burst forth like it had been set aflame, exploding everywhere.
