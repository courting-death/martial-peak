## Chapter 223 — Aerial Battle (Part Two)

Although the two men jumped off the cliff one after the other, Yang Kai fell on his own, while Yu Chengkun used external force to propel himself down. Naturally, their speeds could not be compared; the latter was undoubtedly much faster.

“Kid, even if you die, it must be at my hands!” Yu Chengkun shouted coldly as he pounced towards Yang Kai, head down and feet up.

In mid-air, Yu Chengkun’s ghostly claws danced, and a twisted human face suddenly shot out from his palm. This face was very similar to the one Yang Kai had seen when he first encountered the Earth Demon. The face roared with a ghastly expression, mixed with unmatched resentment and murderous intent, like a vengeful spirit, and in an instant, it lunged at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai extended his hand and struck towards the ghostly face, but he felt no resistance at all; instead, he was engulfed by the vengeful spirit that surged into his body.

A chill spread through his arm, causing Yang Kai to shiver involuntarily as his entire arm quickly became covered in frost.

Yu Chengkun laughed triumphantly, “You’re dead for sure!”

This technique was the evil martial art known as the Ghost King Seal from Ghost King Valley, cultivated using human souls. It involved capturing a living person and continuously tormenting and humiliating them without allowing them to die, filling them with anger and resentment. After reaching a certain threshold, they would be killed, and their vengeful spirit would be extracted and absorbed for cultivation.

This move from the disciples of Ghost King Valley could not be defended against by ordinary means. Once the vengeful spirit entered the body, the enemy was essentially a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

Yu Chengkun did not want to waste time and naturally aimed to quickly kill Yang Kai to obtain the blood and Primordial Qi condensed into blood beads.

After successfully executing his move, he recklessly reached out to grab Yang Kai.

However, in the next moment, Yu Chengkun’s body trembled involuntarily, his face turning as white as paper, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Just now, he felt the connection between the vengeful spirit he had sent out and himself had been severed! This vengeful spirit contained his blood, true essence, and soul; once the vengeful spirit was destroyed, Yu Chengkun would also suffer a significant backlash.

“What’s going on?” Yu Chengkun was horrified as he looked down. He saw the frost on Yang Kai’s arm melting at a visible rate, and the disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion had a smug smile at the corner of his mouth.

“Jie jie jie jie…” The Earth Demon laughed wildly within Yang Kai, “I didn’t expect, I didn’t expect, that I couldn’t make a move, yet someone would bring me a delicious meal! Not bad, not bad, this vengeful spirit has a strong aura of resentment; it’s truly a delightful feast!”

After a few bites, the vengeful spirit was devoured by the Earth Demon. The Earth Demon licked his lips, “Young Master, ask him if he has any more of this stuff. Have him bring out a few more so that I can at least have a half-full meal.”

“He probably doesn’t have any left!” Yang Kai observed Yu Chengkun’s injury and knew that the vengeful spirit was undoubtedly a precious item; there was no way Yu Chengkun could have another one.

Hearing Yang Kai talking to himself, Yu Chengkun’s expression suddenly turned cold. “It’s you! What method did you use to destroy my Ghost King Seal?”

Yang Kai chuckled coldly, “Guess!”

“I’ll kill you!” Yu Chengkun was furious. He reached out and struck down towards Yang Kai’s crown, his ghostly claws shimmering with a deadly light, murderous intent radiating.

With a soft sound, two fiery red lights suddenly flashed from behind Yang Kai. Sensing the fierce wave of Primordial Qi, Yu Chengkun’s mind shook in fear, and he hurriedly released Yang Kai, instinctively retracting his attack and raising his hands defensively in front of him.

But just after he completed this action, he saw Yang Kai, who had fallen alongside him from the cliff, suddenly freeze in mid-air, while he himself continued to plummet downwards at a swift speed.

Looking up, Yu Chengkun’s pupils contracted sharply.

He saw the disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion standing proudly in mid-air, his cold eyes gazing down at him like a hawk surveying the earth, exuding an aura that commanded respect.

And behind him…

There were a pair of fiery red wings! They burned like flames, distorting the surrounding air.

He stood there, invincible, looking down upon everything!

Yu Chengkun could hardly believe his eyes.

What kind of treasure was this! No, treasures in this place couldn’t be activated; this wasn’t a treasure. Could it be a martial art? What kind of martial art could produce such a dazzling effect? What kind of martial art could sprout two large wings from one’s back?

As his mind was shaken, Yu Chengkun momentarily lost focus.

Yang Kai had already unfurled his Wings of Yang Flame and swiftly descended.

In stark contrast to the previous situation, their positions had completely reversed. Yu Chengkun’s heart tightened, and he dared not be careless. His true essence erupted, and his speed of descent suddenly slowed, showing signs of stabilizing.

Yang Kai would not give him this opportunity. In the blink of an eye, he flew above Yu Chengkun and struck down with a heavy fist towards his crown.

Yu Chengkun felt despair. He was indeed a Martial Artist at the True Essence Realm, but he was only at the Third Stage. If there were no obstacles, he could fly, but with a strong enemy attacking, how could he maintain stable flight?

In other words, a Martial Artist at the True Essence Realm had just learned to fly and could not engage in combat while airborne.

As Yang Kai’s strike came down, he had to mobilize all his true essence to meet it.

With a loud bang, Yu Chengkun plunged downwards at an even faster speed than before. In the high-speed descent, the headwind from below nearly blinded him, and he felt a chill in his mouth and nose.

He hurriedly mobilized his true essence, trying to stabilize his descent, and just as he began to see results, another wave of murderous intent came from above.

Yu Chengkun’s mind was shaken; he never expected Yang Kai’s speed to be so fast. In a moment of panic, he launched a counterattack, but how could a hasty defense stop Yang Kai’s full-force eruption?

Yu Chengkun felt a sharp pain in his hands as the scorching hot Primordial Qi surged into his meridians, nearly bursting into his Dantian.

Only at this moment did he realize that this disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion was not as easy to deal with as he appeared. His Ghost King Seal had been silently neutralized, and he possessed a martial art that allowed him to sprout wings. Moreover, this person’s Primordial Qi was exceptionally pure, truly a classic case of a pig eating a tiger!

All the previous displays of weakness were merely to deceive him.

Yu Chengkun felt immense regret; he should never have been tempted by those few bottles of pills to jump off the cliff with this kid. Now, suspended in mid-air, he could only exert a third of his strength, completely at his mercy.

Looking up, he saw Yang Kai attacking again, but there was no longer any sign of the cliff above him. In this brief moment, he had already fallen over five hundred zhang, and now even if he wanted to fly, he could not rise.

Boom…

Yu Chengkun let out a miserable cry, feeling as if his shoulder had been crushed. His already swift descent accelerated further.

At this speed, once he hit the ground, he would undoubtedly be reduced to a pile of bones!

The breath of death loomed over him, filling Yu Chengkun with fear and despair. He wanted to beg for mercy, but as soon as he opened his mouth, the strong wind rushed in, preventing him from uttering a single sound.

In the sky, the two figures were rapidly descending. The difference was that Yu Chengkun was falling uncontrollably, while Yang Kai, above, fiercely flapped his Wings of Yang Flame, chasing after Yu Chengkun while launching attacks.

Boom… Boom… Boom…

Each attack was spaced out by a long interval, as Yu Chengkun’s speed increased, making it take time for Yang Kai to catch up.

It was unclear how long they had been falling, nor how high the cliff truly was. Both Yang Kai and Yu Chengkun plunged into a thick white mist, as if falling through the clouds.

After launching over a dozen attacks, one of Yu Chengkun’s shoulders was crippled, both arms broken, blood gushing out, leaving him in a miserable and wretched state.

In this aerial battle, with the assistance of the Wings of Yang Flame, Yang Kai was the true master!

If not for Yu Chengkun desperately urging his true essence to slow his descent, Yang Kai would have long been unable to catch up to him. But even so, Yu Chengkun’s falling speed was increasing.

Once again, a wave of murderous intent came from above. Yu Chengkun looked up and saw Yang Kai attacking him again. Panic filled his eyes, and his expression turned fearful.

His arms had been crippled, leaving him unable to defend against this strike. If it landed, he would undoubtedly die!

However, to Yu Chengkun’s astonishment, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed. The attack that was meant to strike him was retracted, and the two flamboyant wings behind him flapped vigorously, slowing his descent rapidly, gradually stabilizing.

Having escaped a calamity, Yu Chengkun felt no joy, as he guessed why Yang Kai had suddenly held back and was desperately slowing his fall.

Looking down, he saw that, as he had suspected, the ground was just a few dozen zhang below.

Desperately urging his true essence, Yu Chengkun hoped to land safely.

But his speed was simply too fast; the distance of a few dozen zhang closed in an instant.

“Bang…”

In mid-air, Yang Kai’s eyelids twitched involuntarily.

As Yu Chengkun hit the ground, a large pool of dark red blood blossomed like a beautiful flower, with shattered flesh and severed limbs scattered everywhere, looking extremely horrifying.

A Martial Artist at the True Essence Realm, Third Stage, if confronted directly, Yang Kai estimated he would have no hope of victory. However, using this terrain, the enemy had caused him no harm before meeting a gruesome end.

One should never underestimate their opponent! Yang Kai bit his lip, reflecting inwardly.

At the moment Yu Chengkun died, Jin Hao and the woman rushed to the edge of the cliff, their expressions changing dramatically.

The three of them from Ghost King Valley had special methods to sense each other’s positions and vitality. Once Yu Chengkun died, Jin Hao and the woman immediately noticed.

“Senior Brother Yu is dead?” the woman gasped, standing frozen in place.

Jin Hao rushed to the edge of the cliff and looked down, only to see a thick fog obscuring the view below, unable to see anything. He could not help but rage, “He must have been dragged down the cliff by that disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, both perishing together!”

“How could he be so careless!” The woman stomped her foot in frustration. “He’s only a Third Stage Martial Artist; even if he really fell off the cliff, he should have been able to fly back up if he had been a bit more cautious.”

Jin Hao’s expression was equally grim. “It seems we underestimated that disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. He must have hidden some incredible means that caught Junior Brother off guard and led to his downfall! Sigh…”
