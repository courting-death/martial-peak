## Chapter 223 — Aerial Battle (Part Two)

Although the two of them jumped off the cliff one after the other, Yang Kai fell on his own, while Yu Chengkun used external force to leap down, making their speeds incomparable; the latter was undoubtedly much faster.

“Kid, even if you die, you must die at my hands!” Yu Chengkun shouted coldly as he pounced towards Yang Kai, head down and feet up.

In mid-air, Yu Chengkun's ghostly claws danced, and a twisted human face suddenly shot out from his palm. This face resembled the one Yang Kai had seen when he first encountered the Earth Demon, its expression twisted in a fierce roar, mixed with unmatched resentment and malevolence, like a vengeful spirit, it rushed towards Yang Kai in an instant.

Yang Kai extended his hand and struck at the vengeful face, but felt no resistance at all; instead, he was overwhelmed by the vengeful spirit that surged into his body.

A chill spread through his arm, causing Yang Kai to shiver involuntarily, frost rapidly covering his entire arm.

Yu Chengkun laughed triumphantly, “You’re dead for sure!”

This technique was the evil martial art known as the Ghost King Seal from Ghost King Valley, cultivated using human souls. It involved capturing a living person and continuously tormenting and humiliating them without allowing them to die, filling them with anger and resentment. Once they reached a certain level, they would be killed, and their vengeful soul would be extracted and absorbed for cultivation.

This move from a disciple of Ghost King Valley was something that could not be defended against with ordinary means. Once the vengeful spirit entered the body, the enemy was essentially a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.

Yu Chengkun did not want to waste time and aimed to kill Yang Kai quickly to obtain the blood and essence that could form blood pearls.

After successfully executing his move, he recklessly reached out to grab Yang Kai.

But the next moment, Yu Chengkun's body trembled uncontrollably, his face turning as white as paper, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Just now, he felt that the connection with the vengeful spirit he had sent out had been severed! This vengeful spirit contained his blood, true essence, and soul; once the vengeful spirit was destroyed, he would also suffer a heavy backlash.

“What’s going on?” Yu Chengkun was horrified as he looked down. He saw the frost on Yang Kai's arm melting at a visible speed, and the corner of this Lingxiao Pavilion disciple's mouth curled into a smug smile.

“Jie jie jie jie…” The Earth Demon in Yang Kai's body laughed maniacally, “I never expected, I can’t make a move, yet someone would deliver a delicious meal right to my door! Not bad, not bad, this vengeful spirit has quite a strong malevolent aura, truly a delightful treat!”

After a few bites, the vengeful spirit was devoured by the Earth Demon. Licking his lips, the Earth Demon said, “Young Master, ask him if he has any more of this stuff. Have him bring out a few more so I can at least have a half-full meal!”

“He probably doesn’t have any left!” Yang Kai observed Yu Chengkun's injury and knew that such a vengeful spirit was indeed a precious item; there was no way Yu Chengkun could have another one.

Hearing Yang Kai speak to himself, Yu Chengkun's expression turned icy, “It’s you! What method did you use to destroy my Ghost King Seal?”

Yang Kai chuckled coldly, “Guess!”

“I’ll kill you!” Yu Chengkun roared in fury. He reached out to strike Yang Kai’s crown, his ghostly claws shimmering with a deadly light, exuding a murderous intent.

With a soft sound, two fiery red lights suddenly burst forth from behind Yang Kai. Feeling the fierce wave of true essence, Yu Chengkun's mind was shaken, and he quickly released Yang Kai, retracting his attack instinctively, raising his hands defensively in front of him.

But just as he completed this action, he saw Yang Kai, who had fallen alongside him off the cliff, suddenly freeze in place, while he himself continued to plummet downward at an astonishing speed.

Looking up, Yu Chengkun's pupils constricted.

He saw that the Lingxiao Pavilion disciple stood proudly in mid-air, his cold eyes gazing down at him, like a hawk surveying the earth, exuding an aura that demanded respect.

And behind him…

There were a pair of fiery red wings! They burned like raging flames, and the surrounding air twisted infinitely.

He stood there, invincible, looking down upon everything!

Yu Chengkun could hardly believe his eyes.

What kind of secret treasure was this! No, the treasures here couldn’t be activated; this was not a treasure. Could it be a martial technique? What kind of martial technique could produce such a dazzling effect? What kind of martial technique could cause two large wings to sprout from a person's back?

As his mind was shaken, Yu Chengkun was momentarily dazed.

But Yang Kai had already unfurled his Wings of Yang Flame and swiftly flew downward.

In stark contrast to the previous situation, their positions had completely reversed. Yu Chengkun's heart sank, and he dared not be negligent; his true essence surged, and his falling speed suddenly slowed, showing signs of stabilizing.

Yang Kai would not give him this opportunity. In the blink of an eye, he flew above Yu Chengkun and struck down with a heavy punch aimed at his crown.

Yu Chengkun cried out in despair. Although he was indeed a True Essence Realm martial artist, he was only at the third layer of True Essence Realm. If unimpeded, he could fly in the air, but with a strong enemy attacking, how could he maintain stable flight?

In other words, a True Essence Realm martial artist had just learned to fly and could not engage in combat while airborne.

As Yang Kai's strike came down, he had to channel all his true essence to counter it.

With a loud bang, Yu Chengkun plummeted downward at an even faster speed than before. The rushing wind from below nearly blinded him, and he felt a chill in his mouth and nose.

In a hurry, he tried to stabilize his descent, but just as he made some progress, another wave of killing intent came from above.

Yu Chengkun was shocked; he never expected Yang Kai's speed to be so fast. In his haste, he attempted to counterattack, but his hurried defense was no match for Yang Kai's full-force explosion.

Yu Chengkun felt a sharp pain in his hands as the scorching true essence surged into his meridians, almost rushing into his dantian.

Only at this moment did he realize that this Lingxiao Pavilion disciple was far from as easy to deal with as he appeared. His Ghost King Seal had been silently resolved, and he possessed a martial technique that sprouted wings from his back. Moreover, this person's true essence was extraordinarily pure, truly the epitome of a wolf in sheep's clothing!

All his previous weakness was merely to deceive him.

Yu Chengkun felt immense regret; he should never have been tempted by those few bottles of pills to jump off the cliff with this kid. Now, suspended in mid-air, he could only exert a third of his strength, and he was being thoroughly dominated.

Looking up, he saw Yang Kai attacking again, but there was no longer any sign of the cliff above him. In this brief moment, he had already fallen over five hundred zhang, and now even if he wanted to fly, he could not ascend.

Boom…

Yu Chengkun let out a miserable cry, feeling as if his shoulder had collapsed. His already rapid descent accelerated even further.

At this speed, once he hit the ground, he would undoubtedly be reduced to a pile of bones!

The breath of death approached, and Yu Chengkun was filled with dread, his heart pounding. He wanted to beg for mercy, but as soon as he opened his mouth, the fierce wind rushed in, preventing him from uttering a sound.

In the sky, the two figures were plummeting rapidly; the difference was that Yu Chengkun was falling uncontrollably, while Yang Kai was fiercely flapping his Wings of Yang Flame, chasing after Yu Chengkun while launching attacks.

Boom… Boom… Boom…

Each attack was spaced out by a considerable interval, as Yu Chengkun's speed increased, and Yang Kai needed time to catch up.

It was unclear how long they had been falling, nor how high the cliff was. Both Yang Kai and Yu Chengkun plunged into a white mist, as if falling through clouds.

After launching a dozen or so attacks, one of Yu Chengkun's shoulders was rendered useless, both arms broken, blood flowing profusely, looking utterly miserable.

In this aerial battle, with the aid of the Wings of Yang Flame, Yang Kai was the true master!

If not for Yu Chengkun desperately channeling his true essence to slow his descent, Yang Kai would have had no way to catch up. Yet even so, Yu Chengkun's falling speed was still increasing.

Once again, a wave of killing intent came from above. Yu Chengkun looked up and saw Yang Kai launching another attack at him. His eyes darkened, and his expression turned to one of terror.

His arms were already incapacitated, and he could no longer defend himself. If this attack landed, he would undoubtedly die!

But to Yu Chengkun's astonishment, Yang Kai's expression suddenly changed, and the attack that was meant for him was retracted. The two flamboyant wings behind him flapped vigorously, and his falling speed rapidly slowed, gradually stabilizing.

Having escaped a calamity, Yu Chengkun felt no joy, as he guessed why Yang Kai had suddenly held back and was desperately slowing his descent.

Looking down, it was indeed as he suspected; just dozens of zhang below was the ground.

With his true essence surging out desperately, Yu Chengkun hoped to land safely.

But his speed was simply too fast; the distance of dozens of zhang closed in an instant.

“Bang…” 

In mid-air, Yang Kai's eyelids twitched involuntarily.

As Yu Chengkun fell to the ground, a large pool of dark red blood blossomed like a beautiful flower, with shattered flesh and severed limbs scattered everywhere, looking extremely horrifying.

A True Essence Realm third-layer martial artist, if facing head-on, Yang Kai estimated he would have no hope of victory. However, using this terrain, his enemy had caused him no harm and had met a tragic end.

Never underestimate your opponent! Yang Kai bit his lip, silently reflecting.

At the moment Yu Chengkun died, Jin Hao and the woman rushed to the edge of the cliff, their expressions changing.

The three of them from Ghost King Valley had a special method to sense each other’s positions and vitality. Once Yu Chengkun died, Jin Hao and the woman immediately noticed.

“Senior Brother Yu is dead?” the woman gasped, standing frozen in place.

Jin Hao rushed to the edge of the cliff and looked down, only to see a thick mist obscuring the view below, unable to see anything. He couldn’t help but curse, “He must have been dragged down the cliff by that Lingxiao Pavilion kid, both perishing together!”

“How could he be so careless!” the woman stamped her foot in anger, “He’s only a third-layer True Essence Realm; even if he really fell off the cliff, he should have been able to fly back up if he was a bit more cautious.”

Jin Hao's expression was equally grim, “It seems we underestimated that Lingxiao Pavilion kid. He must have hidden some formidable means that caught Junior Brother Yu off guard, leading to his downfall! Sigh…”
