## Chapter 1350 — Exit

Cai He and Du Sisi listened at the side with intense focus.

The old woman pondered for a moment, then said, "It is said the Immortal Tree has existed since the dawn of heaven and earth — an extraordinary tree that neither dies nor perishes, coexisting with the world and manifesting myriad transformations. The Immortal Source Liquid is its sap. Rumor has it that a few fate-defying individuals once obtained some of the Immortal Source Liquid, but no one has ever seen the Immortal Tree itself. Whether it truly exists, this old woman does not know."

"Is that so!" Yang Kai stroked his chin, thoughtful. If that were the case, refining the Undying Five Elements Sword seems more plausible. Even if the claims on the Undying Five Elements Sword are somewhat exaggerated, it is still a solid body-tempering technique; training it would certainly help one’s body. The Immortal Source Liquid and the Immortal Tree exist only in rumors and illusions — far too unrealistic.

“Alright, that’s enough about the Three Divine Waters. Let’s divide this Life Dew first before anything else,” the old crone said, waving her hand as her expression turned much more solemn. Looking toward the three at the Saint King Realm, she added, “This old woman won’t bully the young. How about we split the Life Dew here evenly among the four of us?”

Cai He and Du Sisi exchanged a glance and both nodded joyfully.

Yang Kai naturally had no objections.

The old woman then took out several jade vials and began to perform methods to draw the Life Jade Nectar from the pool. The entire process took place right under the noses of the three Saint King Realm disciples; the old woman did nothing deceitful. She truly divided the pool into four equal portions, each person taking one.

"Keep these items safe, but when you return, under no circumstances expose them to unrelated people!" The old woman’s face grew grave as she warned them.

"Yes!" Cai He and Du Sisi gripped their Life Jade Nectar tightly, their faces flushed with happiness, and carefully stored the jade vials inside their Spatial Rings.

Having obtained such precious things, no one felt the trip had been in vain, and Du Sisi had even less reason to blame Cai He for acting on his own and bringing her to the Spatial Array Gate — deep down she felt grateful.

If not for Cai He, she would likely have missed out on such a strange treasure.

"Let's go; we'll look for an exit." The old woman seemed in quite good spirits as she said this, then led the three Saint King Realm disciples and flew off toward the distance.

Yang Kai remained silent, but before they left he glanced back once at the artificial hill; a hint of something unusual flashed in his eyes.

Life Jade Nectar — since it is counted among the Three Divine Waters, its effects ought not to be so limited. The old woman’s brief experiment only made her a few years younger; that was clearly inconsistent with expectations.

Moreover, the old woman splitting the Life Jade Nectar into four shares puzzled Yang Kai. Given her strength and age, she could easily have taken more. Even if she asked, Yang Kai believed Cai He and Du Sisi would not have refused, and he himself would not have objected. Yet she insisted on a quarter share, appearing magnanimous.

Recalling the traces of liquid that flowed over the artificial hill, Yang Kai secretly suspected the pool they had found might not have been pure Life Jade Nectar.

Perhaps... it had flowed in from somewhere else and been diluted along the way!

If he could follow the direction of that flow, he might find more, purer Life Jade Nectar!

If that were the case, the old woman’s behavior would be easily explained — she must have noticed this and therefore split the pot to placate the others while planning to return later to search more thoroughly.

That was not impossible. Yang Kai's mouth curled into a faint smile; others might think like that, so why shouldn't he? After all, hoarding treasure alone brought greater accomplishment and satisfaction.

Of course, these were only his own conjectures; whether they were true remained to be verified.

About a day later, the four gathered again at one point and took turns reporting their findings.

After half a day of exploration earlier, they discovered there really was no immediate danger here and decided to split up to search for an exit. After another half day, they regrouped at this spot.

After sharing their respective discoveries, Yang Kai immediately understood that the place they were currently in was a semi-enclosed space of immense size. Aside from the Life Jade Nectar they had previously found, there wasn’t a single treasure worth noting to be seen—and there were very few exits as well.

The only exit had been discovered by Cai He.

After he described the situation, the old woman fell into thought and said, "So then, our only way out is that exit? Cai lad, is there anything about it to note?"

"Senior, only one thing is noteworthy: there stands a humanoid statue over ten zhang high before the exit. It looks brutal and hideous — it stands there with the exit under its crotch."

"A humanoid statue?" The old woman's brow knit.

"Yes. Other than that, there’s nothing unusual."

The old woman nodded slightly. "Very well, then let us go and take a look."

After some discussion, the four headed toward where Cai He had found the exit. Half an hour later they reached the destination. Cai He pointed ahead: "Senior, that is the exit I found."

Everyone followed the direction of his pointing finger, and their expressions brightened with delight, for there truly was a round doorway over there. It was pitch-black and bottomless, and when they extended their Divine Sense into it, it vanished without a trace, like a stone sinking into the sea—they couldn’t perceive what lay within at all.

And before that round gate stood a grotesque statue over ten zhang tall, legs spread, the round gate positioned beneath its crotch. The sight made everyone smile wryly.

Though it was only a statue, passing under its crotch still made people feel somewhat uncomfortable.

Whether the statue hid some strange feature remained to be examined. The old woman said nothing and released her Divine Sense to thoroughly probe the statue; Yang Kai did the same.

After a long moment, the old crone finally withdrew her Divine Sense and said in a low voice, “This statue doesn’t seem to have any issues. There are no fluctuations of restrictions nor traces of formations. Still, everyone, be careful—since the statue exists here, there must be some trick to it. Don’t let your guard down.”

The younger Saint King Realm disciples hastened to respond and sharpened their focus.

The seals within this ancient ruin are extremely concealed—sometimes even Fei Zhi Tu cannot detect them. Had that not been the case, they would not have been trapped repeatedly upon entering this place.

This statue might very well be the trigger for some sealing mechanism.

A grave look flickered in the old woman's eyes as she opened her mouth and spat out a beam of earthy yellow light. The light flashed and instantly enveloped her entire body. Whatever kind of treasure it was, its defensive power seemed extraordinarily strong.

With that exotic protective ward in place, the old woman relaxed slightly and said slowly, "I will lead the way. Follow closely."

Yang Kai and the others quickly invoked their own Secret Treasures for defense and trailed behind the old woman.

A moment later the old woman walked to within a dozen or so zhang of the round gate. Throughout the approach she kept vigilant, especially watching the statue.

Still nothing happened, which made her breathe a little easier — since they entered this region they had not encountered any danger, and she thought perhaps this place really was exceedingly safe.

But she did not relax her guard; if anything, she became even more wary.

After taking a few more steps forward with nothing occurring, the old woman let out a slight smile and was about to speak when the humanoid statue ahead emitted a faint sound.

Hearing this, everyone's faces changed dramatically.

The old woman's reaction was lightning-fast. Her body blurred and a residual image remained where she had been as she retreated rapidly.

But a terrifying scene unfolded: high in midair, a huge palm struck from the side with the speed of thunder and grabbed her in its hand — she had no chance to dodge.

"Senior!" Cai He cried out, his eyes trembling violently.

Yang Kai's face turned grave as he exclaimed, "A puppet?"

The statue, which had been motionless, actually moved. Dark red light bloomed from its eyes, fearsome and dreadful. Although it seemed clumsy and massive, its motions were terrifyingly swift.

Yang Kai had been right behind the old woman and had seen everything clearly. The moment the statue made a sound, its great hand swept out and seized the old woman; despite her swift reaction, she was still taken.

All of this happened in the blink of an eye. By the time Yang Kai leaped back reflexively, the old woman had been captured.

She was after all a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator who had spent many years immersed in that realm; her methods were not those of an ordinary Origin Returning Realm practitioner. She furiously stirred her Saint Yuan, pointed, and a massive blade suddenly formed and slashed fiercely at the puppet's hand that held her.

A crisp metallic clash rang out, sparks flying. The old woman stared in disbelief — the puppet's huge hand had not been harmed in the slightest; not even a mark remained.

Seemingly enraged by that strike, the giant puppet tightened its grip. A flash of red light surged in its eyes as it clutched the old woman's body even harder.

The old woman's face went ashen. Her frail body erupted with strength not inferior to that of a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, and she struggled violently.

To no avail — the great hand was like an iron hoop, binding her tight. No matter how she urged her Saint Yuan, it did nothing.

Crack... crack...

The sound of despair came as the earth-yellow protective layer she had deployed shattered under the puppet's grip, splitting with countless fissures at remarkable speed. In the next moment it collapsed into a bead-shaped Secret Treasure and fell to the ground, reduced to powder.

That protective Secret Treasure was directly destroyed!
