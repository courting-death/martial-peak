## Chapter 2038 — Watch Your Back


The final clash between the two Second-Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivators had clearly left Han Leng gravely wounded. After steadying himself, he spat out a mouthful of purple-black blood, and the razor-sharp aura that had surged moments ago collapsed into feebleness.

Liu Yizhi, meanwhile, had already vanished without a trace—there wasn't even a scrap of his presence within a one hundred zhang radius. Only the shield-shaped Secret Treasure he had deployed fell from the sky in tatters, its surface dim and lifeless, its spiritual potency gone.

That shield-shaped defensive Secret Treasure had clearly been destroyed.

If even such a Secret Treasure could be annihilated, the outcome for Liu Yizhi was easy to imagine.

"Damn it!" Han Leng said with a sullen face, gritting his teeth as he bellowed; another mouthful of blood spurted out, yet his breathing finally eased somewhat.


Only then did Ning Yuancheng—who had been hiding on the tower-ship watching the battle—finally react. He scrambled up in a panic, trembling hands forming spirit-signs as the exquisitely crafted tower-ship hummed, shifted direction, and began to flee.

If even Liu Yizhi had been killed by Han Leng, what nerve did Ning Yuancheng have to remain? All he could think was to get as far away as possible.

But how could Han Leng allow that? The moment the tower-ship stirred, Han Leng snorted coldly, forced himself to his feet, his figure flickered, and he disappeared from where he had been.

Immediately, the numerous silver moons that had dimmed abruptly brightened for an instant; the great formation thrummed, converging once more into a terrifying beam of moonlight that slammed toward the tower-ship.

Han Leng obviously intended to leave no survivors; if word of today’s events spread, Fei Sheng Palace would never spare him.

The moonlight beam struck like lightning, slamming into the tower-ship’s protective shield. The tremendous force rocked the sizeable vessel, and Ning Yuancheng, who stood on the deck, slipped and rolled to the ground in surprise.

Ssshhh……


A grating sound rang out as the corrosive moonlight gnawed at the tower-ship’s shield. At that moment Han Leng revealed a trace of his figure—he had truly been concealed within the moonlight beam—and the long sword in his hand flashed; aided by the formation’s might, he sought to rend the ship’s defenses in one stroke.

"Senior Han, why must you do this to the end? Spare me. Spare me, will you? Let today never have happened," Ning Yuancheng begged, though he possessed cultivation at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; seeing Han Leng attack like a tiger descending the mountain, he was flustered and implored for mercy, never thinking to put up a fight.

Han Leng said nothing, his gaze growing ever colder and more merciless.

Ning Yuancheng was instantly terrified out of his wits and begged all the harder.

Crack……

The crisp sound rang like the funeral bell of death in Ning Yuancheng’s ears. His face went pale as his eyes focused——he saw a sight that sent his soul fleeing: a fissure had split open on the tower-ship’s shield, and it was on the verge of failing.

Crack, crack……

The fissure widened, and more cracks appeared around it; soon the spiderweb of cracks crossed and multiplied, clearly on the verge of giving way.

In the end, with Han Leng’s explosive shout, the tower-ship’s protective shield shattered into pieces, and at the same time the many silver moons that had covered this small space vanished.

The Flourishing Moon Great Formation, its last vestige of power spent, unraveled and collapsed of its own accord.

The moonlight beam dispersed, and Han Leng—wreathed in sword-light—surged forward with a sharp, relentless momentum and came to a stop before Ning Yuancheng. His longsword barely twitched in his hand, and in the next instant his figure had slipped to a position just behind Ning Yuancheng.

Under threat to his life Ning Yuancheng instinctively formed a defensive posture, but that was all he could manage……

A short while later a spot of crimson appeared on Ning Yuancheng’s forehead, and he collapsed onto his back, slamming onto the tower-ship’s deck with a thud.

The Fei Sheng Palace tower-ship’s Secret Treasure, having lost its controller, spun wildly as it plummeted from the heavens, finally smashing into the ground and sending up a billowing cloud of dust.

Not far off, Yang Kai, who had concealed himself and watched the battle from start to finish, looked on with a detached expression, narrowing his eyes as he searched for Han Leng’s silhouette.

This man had single-handedly eliminated so many Fei Sheng Palace cultivators. Though he had relied on the formation’s power, his personal strength could not be underestimated. After such a great battle he must be exhausted; perhaps not even half of his usual combat power remained.

Yang Kai figured that if he acted now he’d have roughly a ninety percent chance of success — a textbook case of the snipe-and-clam struggle where the fisherman reaps the reward.

However, Yang Kai’s only concern was that Han Leng might have hidden some trump card, or, like Liu Yizhi, use a self-destruction of a Secret Treasure; if that were the case, even if he did not die he would be badly wounded.

As Yang Kai's thoughts flickered, Han Leng had already emerged from the tower-ship—he seemed to have rummaged through Ning Yuancheng's corpse and now clutched a Spatial Ring; after a moment a flash of light bloomed in his palm and a round, bowl-shaped object materialized.

He weighed it gently, a satisfied smile crossing his face, then returned the round bowl to the Spatial Ring.

Seeing this, Yang Kai immediately confirmed Han Leng’s purpose matched his own: both had come for Liu Yan, who was sealed inside that round bowl.

After finishing all that, Han Leng unexpectedly didn't leave right away. He suddenly lifted his eyelids, fixed a razor-sharp gaze toward where Yang Kai was hiding, and said coldly, "Kid, you've been watching for so long—have you enjoyed the show?"

Yang Kai frowned but did not reveal his figure at once.

Han Leng snorted and sneered, adding, "What? Do you need Han to ask you out personally?"

As he spoke, the long sword in his hand began to glow faintly.

A flicker of astonishment finally crossed Yang Kai’s face — he realized the other was not merely putting on a show, but was truly aware of his presence.

He no longer hid; calmly he dispelled the Nothingness Secret Technique and revealed himself.

Han Leng raised an eyebrow and conceded, "Quite a clever concealment method, interesting."

Yang Kai looked at him and grinned, "You flatter me, Senior Han. A clever concealment is still seen through by you — I’m just wondering how you were able to see through it."

"It seems you’re confident in your concealment technique," Han Leng appraised Yang Kai from head to toe. Because Yang Kai was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, Han Leng showed no sign of alarm and said loudly, "With my skill I couldn’t have detected it, but… because you were inside the Flourishing Moon Great Formation’s encirclement, that changes matters."

Yang Kai nodded in understanding, "I see!"

Han Leng regarded Yang Kai with cold indifference and said lightly, "So—you're hiding here to be the oriole behind the mantis, snatching the prey after someone else has done the hunting?"

Yang Kai chuckled without hiding it, “I did have that in mind — but if Senior Han is willing to hand over that round bowl, I’ll take it and be gone immediately.”

"You want this fire-type Artifact Spirit?" Han Leng’s expression darkened; as if recalling something, he nodded, "Right, you also bid at the auction."

"Indeed, but my funds were short, so I had to try other means."

"You think you can snatch something from Han? Do you not know how to write the character for death?" Han Leng sneered.

"Since I dared to come, I naturally have some backing. Senior Han has just fought a great battle and is greatly drained — now is not the wise time to make an enemy of me."

Hearing Yang Kai speak so calmly, Han Leng’s eye twitch betrayed his irritation.

What right did a Third Stage of the Void King Realm have to act so brazenly before him? Yet, as the other had said, he must have backing — backing sufficient to make him unafraid. At that thought Han Leng’s mood soured.

He did not want to fight again; his injuries were not fatal but not light either, and, most importantly, his Origin Qi reserves were running low.

“Heh, heh—it's been a long time since anyone dared be so insolent before Han,” Han Leng said after staring at Yang Kai for a moment, suddenly sneering as he let out that seemingly offhand remark. “Kid, I’ll remember you. I hope you live long enough.”

Yang Kai smiled and said, "Senior Han had better not try to flee — unfortunately for you, I’m very good at tracking those who run; you probably... won’t get away."

As he spoke, the spatial energy around Yang Kai surged and he vanished from sight.

The next moment he had appeared at Han Leng’s other side, as if he had been standing there all along.

Even the well-seasoned Han Leng was taken aback and exclaimed, "What kind of footwork is this?"

Such strange and unfathomable movement speed was something even he could not match; it seemed the earlier claim about being adept at tracking fleeing cultivators was not empty boasting. If this kid used such movement repeatedly to harass him he would be hard-pressed to cope.

Han Leng’s expression turned dark.

Yang Kai opened his mouth to speak again, but his eyes suddenly widened in disbelief as he stared at the space behind Han Leng, as if he had seen a ghost, then he shouted, "Watch your back!"

Han Leng sneered, "Petty tricks and you dare to show them before me……"

He assumed Yang Kai was deliberately trying to distract him so that he could launch a sneak attack.

Such a childish ruse would not fool a battle-hardened warrior like him. If he really trusted Yang Kai and looked back, Han Leng was certain Yang Kai would strike in the next moment.

But no sooner had the words left his mouth than something felt wrong.

There really was some eerie movement behind him.

Han Leng shuddered inwardly, hurriedly spurring his protective Origin Qi around his body, and with a step he intended to glide forward.

But even his swift movement was too late.

Behind him a razor-sharp, azure spike quivered and then thrust forward.

The spike moved with such speed it seemed to tear space itself, producing visible ripples.
