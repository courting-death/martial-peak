## Chapter 1805 — Change a Body to Refine

The process of refining the Origin of the Floating Continent had gone quite smoothly at first; it seemed that once the continent's Origin Force was drawn into himself he would have succeeded, but unexpectedly it failed at that final step.

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he recalled the scene just now. His brows furrowed tightly. “Could it be that two types of Origin Power cannot coexist within one body?”

In that instant he had distinctly felt the Dark Star's Origin within him erupt; it was like a guardian bird driving the Floating Continent's Origin back.

That was what caused Yang Kai to suffer the backlash injury.

"Origin Force is bound up with the laws of heaven and earth; one realm, one law, and even one Cultivation Star can only possess a single heaven-and-earth law—let alone a mortal body…"

"I already refined the Dark Star's Origin and am closely linked to the Dark Star's law; I fear it will no longer tolerate another law or another Origin…"

"Yes, it must be that!"

Thoughts raced through Yang Kai's mind, and before long he understood the root of the matter. Although it was only his own conjecture, he believed this conjecture did not miss by much.

It was precisely because he had once refined the Dark Star that he could not refine the Tongxuan Continent's Origin Force this time.

From the looks of it, the reason no one in the Star Domain had ever become the Lord of two Stars wasn’t because those Void King Realm experts lacked strength, but because such a thing was fundamentally impossible.

Once he saw through this, Yang Kai felt considerably dispirited.

The situation was like being desperately hungry yet unable to eat a thing—utterly frustrating and depressing.

Was this heaven-bestowed opportunity to be squandered just like that?

Not to mention the Tongxuan Continent's Stellar Origin had only just been born; it was extremely easy to refine, and, more importantly, that Origin already bore the mark of his soul—he met all the prerequisites. An opportunity like this appeared once in ten thousand years; Yang Kai was far from willing to give up the Origin Force before him.

But his body could no longer accommodate another Origin, and that left him helpless.

Yang Kai sat where he was, healing his wounds and racking his brains for a way to have it both ways.

He thought for a long time and could come up with no good solution; he fretted and scratched at his head in frustration.

Then, slowly, something seemed to occur to him; his anxious, irritable gaze cleared and brightened, and after staring in thought for a moment he could not help but laugh out loud.

"Stupid. Truly stupid. How did I not think of this?" Yang Kai slapped his forehead with his palm, half-mad with excitement.

At the next moment he waved his hand and both the Stone Puppet and the Fire Bird appeared before him.

"Master, any orders?" Liu Yan immediately asked, as always, upon appearing.

"You two, examine that thing in front of us—whoever can swallow it gets it. If both can swallow it, split it in half!" Yang Kai pointed at the Stellar Origin and said indifferently.

The Stone Puppet and the Fire Bird had always been his greatest aids; both now possessed the strength to contend with Void King Realm opponents. If they could swallow the Stellar Origin, it's power would surely cause them to grow further.

Since he himself could not refine it, he might as well let his two great aids try; if they succeeded, it would be a tremendous boon to him.

Liu Yan glanced toward that Origin, and in the next moment fear rose in her beautiful eyes. She said in alarm, "Master, I don't know what that is, but I don't think I can swallow it. There is a profound intent about it higher than mine; if I swallowed it rashly I'd be destroyed by it."

"That's a Law," Yang Kai nodded and explained.

As an Artifact Spirit, Liu Yan's knowledge was limited, so she did not recognize the Stellar Origin, but she had instincts—like a wild beast she knew by instinct what was dangerous to her and what was not.

The Origin before them gave Liu Yan a strong sense of danger.

The power of a Law was unfathomably profound; how could Liu Yan dare to swallow it recklessly?

It was not just Liu Yan—little Xiaoxiao, usually goofy and simple, now stared with small eyes fixed on the Origin and made no move.

Had it been before, if Yang Kai allowed it to swallow something, it would have leapt forward in impatience and gulped it down; with its innate talents and divine power it never feared indigestion.

Now it stopped short as well, clearly feeling the threat the Stellar Origin posed to it.

The last time it managed to swallow an Origin from a mineral star, that Origin was from a dead star and had dispersed—only a trace remained and posed no harm, which allowed it to succeed. But the Floating Continent's Origin was whole; although newly born, it was by no means something little Xiaoxiao could touch.

Seeing their state, Yang Kai immediately knew the two were powerless and said, "Very well, you two may go back."

With a wave he took back Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan.

A different golden Stone Puppet then reappeared before Yang Kai.

The Stone Puppet Incarnation!

Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan could not handle the Origin, but Yang Kai did not worry—he still had his Incarnation. He had called Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan out earlier to let them gain some benefit and grow sooner.

Since they were powerless, it was time for the Incarnation to take the stage.

If his body could not accommodate two Origins, then surely using another body would pose no problem?

Moreover, the Incarnation carried a strand of his Soul Incarnation—equivalent to another self—which he thought would perfectly match the mark on the Origin.

He released the Soul Incarnation into the Golden Stone Puppet, and its once-murky, dim eyes suddenly brightened.

Controlling the Incarnation, Yang Kai sat before the Origin and repeated the earlier actions, performing the Star Refining Technique.

Time passed little by little, and Yang Kai's face on his true body grew extremely grave.

Although he believed his reasoning to be sound, Yang Kai didn’t dare be too sure before seeing the results. If even his Incarnation failed to refine the Stellar Origin, then he could only grit his teeth and give up this hard-won opportunity.

In that case he would have his relatives and friends attempt to refine it, see if any of them were fated for it. But that too would require them to grow stronger—at least to Void King Realm… who knew when that might be.

At a certain moment, closely watching the fluctuations between the Incarnation and the Origin, Yang Kai's brow rose and a look of wild joy appeared on his face; he could not help laughing aloud.

The Stellar Origin before him was being drawn into the Incarnation at a slow but subtle pace, showing no hint of resistance.

It had succeeded!

His guess had indeed been correct — the reason his true body had been unable to refine it was that two kinds of Origins could not coexist within a single body. Once he used another body, the problem was solved with ease.

The Incarnation was essentially another self; if the Incarnation became the Star Lord of the Floating Continent, then that was equivalent to him becoming the Floating Continent's Star Lord.

Though it might seem a bit like taking advantage of a loophole, this way, he was still the lord of two stars.

Tsk tsk… if word of this spread, it would almost certainly shake the entire Star Domain.

In high spirits, Yang Kai held his breath and concentrated, not daring to be careless. He watched the Incarnation's movements closely.

Everything proceeded in an orderly fashion; once the Origin Force was fully poured into the Incarnation, the great work would be complete.

Only… the speed was a bit slow.

Yang Kai grew greatly displeased.

By his estimate, the Incarnation would need at least a month or two to fully refine the Origin, whereas back when he became the Dark Star's lord it had been done in the blink of an eye.

But that time Yang Yan had directly delivered the Dark Star's Origin, so the two situations were not comparable.

"Fine, I'll go open the furnace and refine pills!" He was bored sitting around, so Yang Kai stood up, formed a hand seal, and space power surged through him as he vanished.

The Incarnation no longer needed monitoring; it was only a matter of time, and he could not be bothered to wait any longer—he might as well use the time to refine a few batches of Spiritual Pills.

He had reached the peak of the Origin Returning Realm; in the Lost Realm he had felt the opportunity to breakthrough, but at the time the situation was tumultuous and he had forcibly suppressed it.

The Floating Continent was perfectly safe and the heavenly laws were intact—an excellent place to breakthrough. He intended to use pill-refining to stir the qi that would lead to his breakthrough.

His gains in the Lost Realm had truly been considerable.

A short while later, Yang Kai arrived at a spot on the Floating Continent, sent out his Divine Sense to probe a little, and then moved to the left.

After a dozen or so breaths, Yang Kai reappeared.

Lü Guichen, who had been waiting here, was startled; when he recognized Yang Kai he hurried over carrying the Spatial Ring with both hands and said with a fawning smile, "Young hero, everything is inside; take a look and see if you're satisfied."

Having witnessed Yang Kai's methods, Lü Guichen was now as obedient as a rabbit, showing no hint of defiance.

"Hm." Yang Kai gave a faint reply, drew the ring to him from afar, swept his Divine Sense inside, and raised an eyebrow with a half-smile at Lü Guichen. "You gathered quite a lot these years."

"Heh heh…" Lü Guichen chuckled awkwardly. "With nothing else to do here but cultivate, I just roamed around."

"And you collected every heaven-and-earth treasure you saw?"

"The young hero is wise!"

"Idiot!" Yang Kai's face darkened and he shouted.

"Huh?" Lü Guichen looked up in surprise.

"Utterly foolish!" Yang Kai's expression turned iron-blue. "You're already at Origin Returning Realm—how could you gather heaven-and-earth treasures at will without proper preservation methods? Do you not know their potency fades? Look at these medicinal materials in the ring—some of their effects have already faded by half. How am I supposed to use them? You're as stupid as a pig."

Yang Kai was nearly furious.

There were indeed many medicinal materials in the ring, and many were Void King-Grade, but because they had not been properly preserved their potency had faded too much and their value was greatly reduced.

Any alchemist who saw this would likely fly into a rage.

Lü Guichen took the scolding without daring to reply, forcing an embarrassed smile.

Yang Kai sighed; he knew it was not wholly Lü Guichen's fault—if he had his own Spatial Ring back then, the potency would not have faded so much. Unfortunately, at the time everyone's Spatial Rings had been seized by Ghost Ancestor.

Ghost Ancestor must bear some responsibility for that matter as well.
