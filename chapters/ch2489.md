## Chapter 2489 — Sacred Soul Seal

Silence, a ghostly stillness.

Suddenly, the entire void erupted into chaos. Everyone was shaken to their core, their eyes vacant with shock. That Dao Origin Realm youth had taken Liang Qiu’s fierce blow and was actually unharmed?

“Whoa, no way! He blocked it?”

“That was blinding!”

“Is he really at the Dao Origin Realm? This brat must be hiding his cultivation!”

“Hahaha, Liang Qiu just made a complete fool of himself!”

Liang Qiu’s hands went numb, a chill running through him, his mind reeling. Staring at his spear and then at Yang Kai, he choked out, “Kid, are you even human?”

Horror threaded his voice; he couldn't believe Yang Kai had met his attack with a bare fist. How could that be, when Yang Kai was still only at the Dao Origin Realm?

“I don’t like the sound of that. If I’m not human, am I a ghost?” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

The surrounding Emperor Realm cultivators now all sized up Yang Kai anew, as if seeing him for the first time.

A Dao Origin Realm cultivator able to contend with an Emperor—none of them had ever heard of such a thing. Even they, when they were at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, could never have achieved what Yang Kai just did.

Just how strong was this brat’s body, to be able to clash head-on with Liang Qiu’s spear? And that recovery speed... it was simply astonishing.

Earlier, his fist had clearly been a bloody mess, but in the blink of an eye it was as good as new. And... the blood he shed wasn’t red, but a faint gold. That blood contained unimaginable vitality and surging Qi and blood fluctuations!

Yao Si’s gaze trembled slightly. As the son of a Great Emperor, he had always considered himself above his peers. He never bothered with other cultivators of his generation, for in terms of talent, strength, or background, no one in the world could surpass him.

When Liang Qiu attacked earlier, he too thought Yang Kai was doomed. He hadn’t paid any more attention.

But now he realized he was gravely mistaken.

There might be people in this world whose backgrounds surpass even his own, but when it came to talent and strength among those of the same generation, he had always believed he stood at the very peak. Yet now, this Dao Origin Realm youth before him was living proof that he was wrong!

“You brat... you’re truly strange!” Liang Qiu scrutinized Yang Kai for a while before shaking his head and speaking.

Yang Kai snorted, “Want to go again? If you do, I’ll accompany you to the end!”

“No, no more!” Liang Qiu shook his head like a rattle-drum. “You’re qualified to stay here!”

The only reason he’d attacked Yang Kai earlier was because he wasn’t at the Emperor Realm. Everyone allowed to remain here were Emperors, or had Emperor Realm companions. Only Yang Kai’s group was at the Dao Origin Realm, making them stand out glaringly.

Naturally, he wanted to teach Yang Kai a lesson, to set an example for those who’d been driven away, so they’d know the serious consequences of staying here without the strength to back it up.

Who would have thought that instead of establishing his authority, he’d end up being shocked by Yang Kai.

If they kept fighting, even if he won, it would seem dishonorable. If he lost, he’d never be able to show his face in the Star Realm again.

Liang Qiu wasn’t at all confident he could defeat Yang Kai.

“Thank you for letting me win!” Yang Kai cupped his fists grandly.

Just then, Liu Yan suddenly called out, “Master, something’s wrong with Xiaoqi!”

Yang Kai quickly turned his head and saw that Mo Xiaoqi’s beautiful eyes had turned icy cold, sharp as blades. An astonishing aura surged from her delicate body, so fierce it seemed to freeze the air. That aura felt strangely similar to the Mountain and River Bell—ancient, wild, and untamed, as if it hailed from the Primordial Era itself.

Everyone who sensed this aura couldn’t help but change their expression.

Because anything connected to the Primordial Era was always extraordinary.

At this moment, Mo Xiaoqi stared straight at Liang Qiu. The killing intent around her was so dense it seemed tangible, slicing the void beside her with a hiss. Her sharp gaze suddenly turned indifferent, as if she looked down on all living things, regarding the world with disdain. It made everyone’s heart tremble in fear.

At the same time, the unsightly butterfly mark on her cheek began to flutter, as if it had come alive, wings trembling as if about to take flight.

As those butterfly wings flickered, an extremely violent aura spread out. Everyone felt their breath catch, as if a great mountain was pressing on their chests.

“What’s going on?” Yang Kai cried out in alarm.

He had no idea why Mo Xiaoqi was suddenly acting so strangely. There hadn’t been any warning signs before. It was only when he heard Liu Yan’s shout that he noticed.

“This is bad!” Not far away, Princess Lan Xun’s face paled, her beautiful eyes trembling as she looked at Mo Xiaoqi and cried out in shock.

“Good grief!” Liang Qiu couldn’t help but wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, muttering nervously, “Why is this girl staring at me like that, as if she wants to eat me?”

Even though he had already advanced to Emperor Realm, being stared at by Mo Xiaoqi made his scalp tingle, his hands and feet go cold, and a sense of impending death linger in his heart, making him anxious and uneasy.

“It’s because you were about to strike against her Eldest Brother Yang!” Lan Xun shouted in a low voice through clenched teeth. “Xiaoqi must have thought Senior Brother Yang was about to be killed by you, and in her panic she ended up like this.”

Liang Qiu swallowed and said, “What’s that got to do with me? That brat rushed over himself. Even if he died, he’d have no one to blame. But seriously, who is this little girl? Earlier she even boasted she’d slaughter everyone in my Hundred Barbarian Mountain. What a joke.”

Though he was laughing, his smile was stiff and unnatural, clearly betraying his fear. Mo Xiaoqi had suddenly become like a different person, and the aura she was giving off was so terrifying—her background was obviously extraordinary, but he had no idea what it was.

Lan Xun glared at him hatefully, enunciating each word: “Her surname is Mo. She’s from the Eastern Territory!”

“Mo... Eastern Territory...” Liang Qiu’s face changed slightly at her words. After muttering to himself, he suddenly realized something and cried out in shock, “No way, is she that person’s...?”

“As long as you understand!” Lan Xun snapped. She was so anxious she was sweating, glancing uneasily at Mo Xiaoqi while talking to Liang Qiu, and kept calling out to her softly, but it had no effect.

“Yao Si, you’re not being fair!” Liang Qiu looked at Yao Si with a bitter face. “You’re all from the Eastern Territory—why didn’t you warn me?”

Yao Si was the son of the Great Emperor Youhun, and Mo Xiaoqi was the daughter of the Beast Great Emperor. Both Great Emperors resided in the Eastern Territory. Liang Qiu didn’t believe Yao Si didn’t know Mo Xiaoqi, but this guy had kept silent, letting him mock her as he pleased.

Remembering how he’d said Mo Xiaoqi hadn’t even grown all her hair yet, Liang Qiu broke out in a cold sweat.

If those words reached the Beast Great Emperor’s ears, wouldn’t he be skinned alive?

If he’d known Yang Kai’s group included the Beast Great Emperor’s daughter, he’d never have done something so foolish.

Yao Si said blandly, “Though we’re both in the Eastern Territory, I’ve never met her. How could I warn you?”

He really didn’t seem to know Mo Xiaoqi, but he did know Lan Xun. With Lan Xun’s status, there was no way she’d lie.

Lan Xun called out for a while, but seeing Mo Xiaoqi still unresponsive, she stamped her foot and said, “Liang Qiu, if anything happens to Xiaoqi, your Hundred Barbarian Mountain will be slaughtered to the last!”

Liang Qiu’s face changed, his mood sinking to rock bottom.

Mo Xiaoqi had said the same thing earlier, but he hadn’t cared. Now that Lan Xun repeated it, he couldn’t ignore it even if he wanted to.

Still... this really didn’t have much to do with him. Liang Qiu felt terribly wronged.

“Junior Sister Lan, what’s wrong with Xiaoqi?” Yang Kai had been watching for a while, but still couldn’t figure out what was happening to Mo Xiaoqi. He only knew her aura was growing more and more terrifying, and the butterfly mark on her cheek was becoming more and more lifelike. The mark had even flown off her cheek, circling around her delicate body.

As time passed, the pitch-black butterfly quickly changed, now the size of a person, looking incredibly bizarre.

Lan Xun said, “Xiaoqi has undone the Sacred Soul Seal!”

“Sacred Soul Seal?” Everyone looked at her curiously, wanting to know what was going on.

“Years ago, the Beast Great Emperor once obtained the Spirit Essence of an Ancient Divine Spirit, the Illusory Heaven Butterfly. Its body was gone, but its Spirit Essence was perfectly preserved, though after countless ages it was weak and frail. The Beast Great Emperor signed a Divine Soul contract with it, and when Xiaoqi was three, he sealed the Illusory Heaven Butterfly inside her body. Before Xiaoqi grew up, the Spirit Essence would protect her, and in return, it could consume a little of her Divine Soul power to survive. This is the Sacred Soul Seal!”

“The Spirit Essence of an Ancient Divine Spirit!” Liang Qiu gasped.

The others’ faces changed as well.

Ancient Divine Spirits had always been mere legends. Of all the people present, only a handful had ever seen one with their own eyes.

Yet now the Spirit Essence of an Ancient Divine Spirit had appeared, sealed inside someone’s body.

No one knew how powerful this Spirit Essence was, but judging by the commotion when it was unsealed, its strength was far beyond what anyone here could handle.

And to be able to seal this Spirit Essence inside his own daughter to protect her, just how terrifying was the Beast Great Emperor’s cultivation?

“Only in the most dangerous moments would Xiaoqi undo the seal. This should be her first time, and she can’t control it at all.” As Lan Xun spoke, she glanced at Yang Kai, a hint of reproach in her eyes.

She herself was deeply shocked. Earlier, Mo Xiaoqi had seemed to care a lot about Yang Kai. She’d thought the girl was just trying to spite her, but now she realized Mo Xiaoqi truly cared about Yang Kai. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have undone her own seal.

She must have thought Yang Kai was doomed, so she undid the seal to avenge him. Who could have guessed Yang Kai would be completely unharmed, while she herself had lost consciousness, her body now controlled by the Spirit Essence of the Illusory Heaven Butterfly.
