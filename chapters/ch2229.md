## Chapter 2229 — Has Come

"Why!" Yi Quan suddenly burst out in anger. "Are all those alchemists useless?"

Yang Kai replied helplessly, "As the saying goes, even the cleverest housewife cannot cook without rice... To refine a Life Origin Pill, you need a main ingredient called the Life Origin Fruit. It's nearly extinct. Without this spirit fruit, how could anyone refine a Life Origin Pill?"

"How could that be?" Yi Quan found Yang Kai's explanation hard to accept. "Isn't the outside world vast and abundant, with endless resources?"

Yang Kai smiled, "That's true, but some things can only be found by chance, not by searching."

Yi Quan fell silent for a long moment, then suddenly seemed to realize something. He looked at Yang Kai with renewed excitement and said, "You know so much about the Life Origin Pill—could it be that you are one of those alchemists?"

"Mm... you could say that." Yang Kai nodded, already understanding what Yi Quan was after, so before he could speak further, Yang Kai continued, "But let me make it clear, alchemists are divided into grades, just like Martial Artists' cultivation. Different grades can refine different Pills. The Life Origin Pill is an Imperial-Grade Pill, and only an Imperial-Grade Alchemist can refine it. As for me... I'm just a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist right now!"

"So what?" Yi Quan barked, "This Lord sees that you are young but already quite accomplished. If given some time, you might well reach the Imperial-Grade. Hm... When that day comes, you will refine the Life Origin Pill for this Lord, how about it?"

Yang Kai gave a wry smile and said, "But I still need the materials."

"Go find them!" Yi Quan said as if it were only natural. "This Lord is not afraid to wait, and can afford to! Whenever you find the Life Origin Fruit, then you can refine the Life Origin Pill! All I need from you now is your promise."

Seeing his attitude, Yang Kai's expression grew serious as well. After a moment's thought, he said, "Since Senior puts it that way, I will do my best. But you may have to wait a very, very long time, and in the end, there may be nothing at all."

"No matter!" Yi Quan waved his hand. "As long as you have the heart, that's enough."

As he spoke, he seemed to see hope at last and said, "Come, come, come. This jar of wine is for you!"

As soon as he finished, another jar of Monkey God Wine was placed in front of Yang Kai.

Yang Kai grinned and, without hesitation, started drinking.

In such a short time, three jars of Monkey God Wine had gone down. Even with the Warm Spirit Lotus as his foundation, Yang Kai couldn't help but feel a bit dizzy by now.

Yi Quan's gaze grew even more amiable as he looked at him. Just as he was about to call someone to take Yang Kai to rest, his expression suddenly turned cold. He turned his head to look in a certain direction.

Noticing the change in his expression, Yang Kai couldn't help but look at him in confusion.

Yi Quan didn't move, just watched quietly. After a while, he said coldly, "How bold!"

"Senior, what's happened?" Yang Kai asked.

But before Yi Quan could answer, a yao expert suddenly flew in from outside, cupped his fists, and said urgently, "My Lord, a human expert has invaded. The Blood Wolf elites are trying to stop him, but the intruder is extremely powerful. Judging by the looks of it, it seems to be..."

"This Lord knows," Yi Quan nodded coldly and ordered, "Tell the Blood Wolves to withdraw. They can't stop him. Let that person in."

The yao expert did not hesitate at all, acknowledged the order, and immediately retreated.

Yang Kai was finally coming to his senses. His face darkened as he said, "Could it be... Zhou Dian has come in person?"

For someone to be taken so seriously by Yi Quan, whose cultivation was so profound, there could be no one else but Zhou Dian.

His guess was right. Yi Quan nodded and said, "Indeed, it's him. To think he'd risk breaking the Heavenly Yao Pact just to barge into my Heavenly Yao Valley... Is it for you?"

"Me?" Yang Kai pointed at his own nose. The wine had mostly worn off, and he laughed, "That can't be. I only arrived here a dozen days ago. Before that, I didn't even know there was such a person as Zhou Dian. Why would he come for me?"

"That, this Lord does not know. But..." As Yi Quan spoke, his figure suddenly flickered, and he appeared in front of Yang Kai, reaching out to pat his shoulder.

Yang Kai was slightly startled, but knowing Yi Quan meant him no harm, he didn't resist.

A gentle force entered from his shoulder, coursing through his limbs and bones.

After a moment, Yi Quan's face darkened. "As expected, someone tampered with you. This Lord was careless."

As he spoke, the force in Yi Quan's hand suddenly surged.

At the same time, Yang Kai grunted, but he clearly heard a strange sound from within his body. Immediately after, he felt inexplicably light, as if he had broken free from some kind of shackle.

"My son told me you once encountered Ban Qing and used some means to kill him. Ban Qing was skilled in stealth and assassination, and also tracking. When he fought you, he apparently planted a mark on you. Zhou Dian has been following that mark..."

Yang Kai's face darkened at these words.

He had suspected before that Ban Qing had done something to him, but with his strength, he couldn't discover it. Now it was clear that those martial artists had been able to track him for a reason.

But... from Yi Quan's words just now, it seemed he had long known some of Yang Kai's secrets, just never pointed them out.

"Sorry to trouble you, Senior," Yang Kai said apologetically.

Yi Quan waved his hand. "No need for that. You saved my son's life, so this Lord should treat you well. As for Zhou Dian... Hmph, he's simply arrogant and blind!"

After saying this, he continued, "As for the methods you used to kill Ban Qing... all I can tell you is this: whatever you do, never, ever leave those insects behind in this place. If you ever have the chance to enter here again, unless you can fully control them, do not bring them in. Long ago, this land nearly faced total destruction because of those very insects..."

Yang Kai exclaimed, "There are Soul-Devouring Worms here too?"

"You call them Soul-Devouring Worms?" Yi Quan's face showed dread. "No matter what they're called, they're the bane of this world. The ones you have now aren't that strong, so I could help suppress them a bit earlier, but that's all. If they ever grow up, even I would become their food!"

"Understood," Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

"As long as you remember!" Yi Quan warned in a deep voice.

"Yi Quan!"

Just then, a thunderous voice rang out from outside. It wasn't actually that loud, but it was full of power, like muffled thunder, shaking the ears and stirring up a storm that swept through the Heavenly Yao Valley, reaching every yao's ears. The weaker ones even felt pain and bled from their ears.

"Hmph!" Yi Quan suddenly turned, glaring in the direction of the voice. Supreme power filled his voice, turning into an invisible attack as he shouted, "Zhou Dian, who gave you the guts to shout and bellow in my Heavenly Yao Valley?"

"Hehehehe, hahahahaha!" Zhou Dian's laughter followed. At first, it was calm, but as his emotions rose, it became more and more frenzied, until it was utterly mad.

Boom, boom, boom...

Explosions rang out from outside, tearing through the void and making the whole world tremble.

Yang Kai stood where he was, his face grim. He felt his Spirit Body was extremely unstable, the light on his body flickering erratically, so he hurriedly circulated his power to protect himself.

Only then did he feel a little better.

When he came to his senses, Yi Quan was nowhere to be seen.

He quickly rushed out of the tree-heart hall, floating in midair and looking around.

Soon, he saw Yi Quan and Zhou Dian.

About fifty li away, Yi Quan, the supreme yao, stood quietly, unmoving, his aura withdrawn. He seemed as unfathomable as a bottomless abyss.

Not far in front of Yi Quan, a burly figure sat atop a majestic Demonic Beast, looking down at Yi Quan from above.

Zhou Dian!

Even though Yang Kai had never seen this man before, he knew exactly who he was.

Only Zhou Dian could make Yi Quan treat someone so seriously.

Behind Zhou Dian stood another tall figure, a red-haired Emperor Realm expert. The fiery red hair was a striking feature, and Yang Kai immediately realized this must be Lian Yan.

Around these two human experts, countless yao experts were scattered, all glaring at them with fierce, murderous eyes, their violent aura on full display.

But not a single yao dared to make a move.

Zhou Dian remained calm, and even Lian Yan showed no sign of nervousness, only a disdainful smile as he looked around, occasionally meeting the eyes of the yao experts and provoking them with his gaze.

"Very good! After so many years, Yi Quan, you are as impressive as ever. That makes this General very pleased!" Zhou Dian was the first to speak, smiling as if the man before him was not a deadly enemy, but an old friend he hadn't seen in years.

Yi Quan sneered, "This Lord is the same as always. But I wonder, Zhou Dian, have your wounds... healed yet?"

As soon as he said this, the smile on Zhou Dian's face vanished, replaced by a chill that seemed to freeze the world.

He took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes. When he opened them again, his expression was calm once more.

Seeing this, Yi Quan raised his eyebrows.

"Yi Quan, if possible, this General would not have come to your Heavenly Yao Valley. But this time, I come by order of the King and have no choice!" Zhou Dian said.

"What does your King's order have to do with this Lord? By the Heavenly Yao Pact, humans are forbidden to set foot within thirty thousand li of Heavenly Yao Mountain. This is the agreement between our two races. Yet today, you break it yourself. Is human credibility truly worth so little?" Yi Quan shouted angrily.

Zhou Dian replied, "Today, this General comes for only one person. Hand him over, and I will leave at once. I will not trouble the experts of your Heavenly Yao Valley. You should have seen, on my way here, I did not kill a single one of your people. That should show my sincerity."

"Do you think Heavenly Yao Valley is a place you can come and go as you please?" Yi Quan raised his eyebrows. "I know who you are here for, but... he is this Lord's honored guest. If you want to take him, you must first ask if this Lord agrees!"
