## Chapter 2031 — Make a Move

"Deputy City Lord, may I ask whether this Spiritual Pill was taken out from the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda?" someone in the crowd shouted from below.

The Drunken Old Man smiled and nodded. "Indeed. And this Spiritual Pill is not one of the pills the major Sects previously deposited inside — it is a genuine Ancient Spiritual Pill. As you can see, because it bears Pill Patterns, its medicinal efficacy has been perfectly preserved; otherwise, after all these years even the most potent Spiritual Pill would have long since turned to dust."

After a Spiritual Pill was refined, it was usually stored in a jade bottle to preserve its effects and slow their dissipation.

Yet even the highest-grade Spiritual Pills would, with the passage of time, have their effects leak away entirely and ultimately become worthless.

But if a Spiritual Pill develops Pill Patterns, there’s no need to worry — those patterns can draw in the surrounding Spiritual Qi on their own, preserving the pill’s efficacy. Even more astonishing is the Pill Cloud that can form above the patterns; a Spiritual Pill with a Pill Cloud will, over time, actually grow stronger, its medicinal potency increasing step by step.

The longer the time, the more terrifying its potency.

If a Void King-Grade Spiritual Pill had produced a Pill Cloud during refinement and then accumulated for millennia, the medicinal force within might even surpass that of an Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pill.

Yang Kai had precisely such a Spiritual Pill in his possession.

Years ago, when he obtained the Purple Void Cauldron in the Imperial Garden, there was a Dragon Flame Purple-Patterned Pill inside that had produced a Pill Cloud; it had been refined by the owner of the "True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy," and for unknown reasons it had remained in the Purple Void Cauldron until Yang Kai fortuitously picked it up.

The Imperial Garden had been silent for tens of thousands of years, and that Dragon Flame Purple-Patterned Pill had been nourished by its Pill Cloud for those ages. So although it was only a Middle-Level Void King-Grade pill, the medicinal power contained within might well rival that of an Imperial-Grade pill.

Such a Spiritual Pill would be of great use even to those in the Emperor Realm.

The reason Yang Kai had never dared to consume it was precisely his fear that the force would be too strong for him to endure, so he had preserved it until now.

He wouldn't dare claim that under heaven this Spiritual Pill was utterly unique, but there could hardly be more than ten of its kind — enough to show how priceless it truly was.

Even with Yang Kai’s present strength, he dared not casually take the Dragon Flame Purple-Patterned Pill; he would have to wait until he grew stronger to see if he could withstand its force.

"Deputy City Lord, what grade is this Spiritual Pill, and what use does it have?" a martial artist below asked; this was exactly the question on everyone’s mind.

The Drunken Old Man smiled slightly. "You needn't even ask — I was just about to explain. After several days of joint research by many of the city’s experts and some alchemists, the conclusion is that this Spiritual Pill is a Middle-Level Dao Origin-Grade Spiritual Pill. And its effects are extremely tempting."

Hearing the Drunken Old Man’s words, the martial artists below immediately became excited and all looked toward the stage with eager expectation.

"No one knows what this pill was called in ancient times, and the prescription has long been lost. The City Lord has named it the Marrow Cleansing Pill; its use — hahah — the name speaks for itself: it can cleanse the marrow and transform the sinews, allowing one to be reborn and raise a practitioner’s cultivation aptitude."

As soon as the Drunken Old Man finished speaking, the crowd below gasped, and their gazes at the Marrow Cleansing Pill grew feverish and ferocious.

Even the experts in the private rooms released Divine Sense to examine that Spiritual Pill.

No wonder everyone reacted this way: a pill that could cleanse marrow and transform sinews and raise cultivation aptitude was wondrous indeed — apart from a few legendary pills that only appeared in tales, nothing like it existed in the Star Realm.

Yet the Marrow Cleansing Pill possessed such heaven-defying effects.

No one disliked having good aptitude; everyone wanted to climb higher. Why were some Third Stage of the Void King Realm practitioners unable to break through to the Dao Origin Realm? It could be due to their cultivation method, injuries, or many other reasons.

But the vast majority were held back by insufficient aptitude!

If one could improve their aptitude even a little, one might be reborn and easily reach the Dao Origin Realm.

The Marrow Cleansing Pill before them was obviously such an item, and so it naturally stirred covetousness.

"That can’t be right, Deputy City Lord." A man’s voice suddenly came from a private room — the Jiang Family man who had bid multiple times earlier. "If this Spiritual Pill truly had such miraculous effects, why would anyone be willing to auction it instead of consuming it themselves? I, Jiang, believe any practitioner with even a bit of sense would not make such a choice. Deputy City Lord, is there something wrong with this Spiritual Pill?"

At this, those whose gazes had grown hot were startled inwardly and silently thought the Jiang Family man had a point; if the Marrow Cleansing Pill’s effects were truly so miraculous, which fool would put it up for auction? One might even suspect City Lord Duan Yuanshan would privately keep and consume it.

The Drunken Old Man’s glowing description had made people instinctively ignore such concerns; now, reminded by the Jiang Family man, they all came to their senses and began clamoring for the Drunken Old Man to explain clearly.

The Drunken Old Man glanced toward the Jiang Family’s private room and chuckled. "Brother Jiang asks well. Though the Marrow Cleansing Pill is miraculous, it does have considerable drawbacks."

"Oh? Please explain," the Jiang Family man said in a grave tone.

"First, though the pill can cleanse marrow and transform the sinews, it only works on practitioners at the Saint King Realm and below; those above the Saint King Realm who take it will see no effect. Second, its effect lasts only until the user reaches the Void King Realm — once the user breaks through to the Void King Realm, their aptitude will be returned to its original state. Apart from these two points, there are no other harms; taking it will not cause side effects, so you may rest assured."

"There really exists such a strange Spiritual Pill?" the Jiang Family man exclaimed in astonishment.

The Drunken Old Man laughed. "Who can say what happened in ancient times? I do not know why such a pill was born back then, but the world is full of talented and eccentric people; it is not surprising someone could devise such a pill."

"I, Jiang, understand. Thank you, Deputy City Lord, for the explanation."

"No trouble, no trouble — this is what I should explain. Since everyone now understands the Marrow Cleansing Pill’s use, the auction shall begin; starting bid is one hundred thousand Source Crystals, and each raise must be no less than five thousand."

"One hundred thousand!"

"One hundred five thousand!"

"One hundred twenty thousand!"

Although the Marrow Cleansing Pill had many limits — being useless for those above the Saint King Realm and reverting aptitude upon reaching the Void King Realm — it still aroused great interest.

After all, the martial artists attending the auction had juniors or descendants; even if they could not use it personally, they could give it to their successors. From the Saint King Realm to the Void King Realm were two major stages; improving aptitude could greatly shorten future cultivation time.

Yet because of its restrictions, it was destined not to fetch an exorbitant price.

The bidding climbed rapidly with many offers and soon broke through the two hundred thousand mark.

In Private Room B-9, Yang Kai’s expression shifted and he began bidding.

Kang Siran stared at him in surprise and asked, "Pillmaster Yang, do you have someone who needs this?"

Yang Kai hesitated for a moment, then nodded. "You could say that. Besides... one shouldn't attend an auction and leave empty‑handed."

"Fair enough." Kang Siran inclined his head. During prior auctions he had purchased a few useful items at reasonable prices; Yang Kai had remained idle until now.

"Pillmaster Yang, feel free to bid — if your Source Crystals are insufficient, I can help." Kang Siran generously offered.

"Thanks, Shopkeeper Kang." Yang Kai smiled faintly and continued bidding, "Two hundred fifty thousand!"

He had participated because the auction involved Zhang Ruoxi; the Zhang Family girl happened to be at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm and could take the Marrow Cleansing Pill.

Although he had little relationship with her, he needed her to help unlock the mysteries on the Ethereal Jade Disc, and he might have to stay with Zhang Ruoxi for a long while; helping her grow quickly would ease his burden.

More importantly, Yang Kai had other motives toward her he could not openly state; this was a way to at least partially compensate and lighten his guilt.

As the price soared, fewer people remained in the bidding. Though rare, the item was useless to most; aside from those intending to cultivate successors, others had withdrawn.

By the time Yang Kai raised his bid to three hundred thousand, only one woman remained vying with him. She sat in the hall, looking not particularly well‑off, her cultivation only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

She hesitated for a long while before raising her bid.

Yang Kai naturally would not give up.

When Yang Kai called out three hundred twenty thousand, the woman finally sighed and appeared to give up.

The Drunken Old Man saw this and immediately went to the stage. "Three hundred twenty thousand once, twice, three times! The winning bidder please come backstage to settle your payment!"

Yang Kai smiled at the announcement, stood up, and told Kang Siran, "I’ll be right back."

"Hurry, Pillmaster Yang; the Dao Origin Fruit is likely to appear soon," Kang Siran said, looking toward the stage with expectation.

Yang Kai nodded.

He stepped out of the private room, went backstage, paid three hundred twenty thousand Source Crystals, and finally took possession of the Marrow Cleansing Pill.

Spending so many Source Crystals on a single pill was not very cost-effective for Yang Kai at present; the sum equaled about one-third of his Source Crystals, and it was not even for his own use.

But in the long run, it was still worthwhile.

Moreover, Yang Kai could study the Marrow Cleansing Pill’s ingredients; if he could deduce its prescription, all the better — after all, this was a lost Ancient Spiritual Pill, and if he could reproduce its formula and refine such pills to sell, he could certainly profit handsomely in the future.
