## Chapter 1538 — Who Won't Give Face

"May I ask who you are, and why you've come to my Bibo City to stir up trouble!" Shan Ying asked with an icy face, his voice deep and controlled.

"Does that matter?" Yang Kai sneered.

Shan Ying frowned. "I, the city lord, have never met you, yet you act so unreasonably—striking down two Deacons of my city lord's mansion. Isn't that going a bit too far?"

He had already seen that Yang Kai's strength was no ordinary thing, so he didn't dare to recklessly tear off the veil.

At such an age with such power, the youth likely had powerful backing; until he was certain, Shan Ying dared not act rashly.

"Too far?" Yang Kai grinned. "I don't think so. Today I came not only to kill your two Deacons, but to take your life as well—everyone who colluded with you will die!"

The warriors of the city lord's mansion felt their bodies and hearts grow cold.

Shan Ying froze for a moment, then suddenly burst into loud laughter. “Interesting, interesting! This City Lord hasn’t met such an amusing young man in a long time. Since you refuse to recognize your place, don’t blame me for being rude—kill him!”

Having given face only to be repaid with none, Shan Ying had reached the limit of his patience with Yang Kai.

Two Deacons had been slain; if he swallowed that humiliation, he feared he would never again retain any authority.

No matter what backing the youth possessed, it could not be greater than his own, so Shan Ying, encouraged by his confidence, no longer bothered to haggle with Yang Kai—he waved his hand and barked an order.

Dozens of the city lord's warriors obeyed; with grim expressions they became beams of light and surged toward Yang Kai.

Although the brutal death of the burly man earlier had filled everyone with dread toward Yang Kai, he was after all only one person; the green-clad girl and the others following him were not regarded by the city lord's forces.

With numbers and momentum on their side, they were fully confident they could take Yang Kai down.

Shadows pressed in as the brilliance of secret arts and Secret Treasures bloomed, sweeping to envelop Yang Kai.

The green-clad girl and the others went pale as they sensed the massive, chaotic energy fluctuations, despair showing in their eyes.

They thought themselves surely doomed.

Yang Kai stood motionless, the smile at the corner of his mouth growing ever colder.

Only when the all-encompassing assault descended did he lift a hand. A Purple Shield slowly appeared.

The shield had originally been no larger than a basin, but once manifested it suddenly expanded, instantly covering an area of around a dozen zhang.

All the attacks struck the shield.

A clanging cascade of sounds rang out, light scattering, and Yang Kai emerged unscathed.

"An Origin-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure!" Shan Ying's eyes narrowed; he immediately recognized the shield's grade, his gaze unconsciously burning with desire.

An Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure was already rare on Dark Star; being a defensive Secret Treasure made it even more valuable. Possessing such a Secret Treasure could instantly elevate a person's strength by a whole grade.

Shan Ying became ever more certain there was a patron behind Yang Kai—how else could he have obtained such an item?

Golden light suddenly flared from behind the shield, and thread-like golden strands shot out. By rough count there were at least a hundred, those strands surging with a terrifying qi-and-blood force, sending unsettling ripples through the air.

They seemed almost alive.

The golden threads swayed to and fro, cutting through the crowd.

No warrior's Saint Yuan could withstand the threads' cutting and piercing; their thick protective auras were like paper, utterly impotent.

Even ordinary defensive Secret Treasures could not withstand the sharpness of those golden strands—sliced in two, their spirit broken, they were utterly ruined.

Horrific screams rose up, unending.

Blood sprayed, severed limbs and shredded flesh littered the ground; heads flew into the air and bodies collapsed.

The city lord's warriors cried out in terror; those still alive, seeing the danger, hastily retreated, trying to flee from Yang Kai.

"Think you can run? Since you've come, don't leave." Yang Kai slowly shook his head, a faint cold smile at his lips. Under his Divine Sense the Golden Blood Threads danced and cut ever faster.

Like a horde of demons dancing in chaos!

All people saw was a blaze of golden light and heard bone-chilling screams; only a few could make out what was happening on the battlefield.

"Quickly—send word to Battle Sky City; have Lord Liang come at once to reinforce!" Shan Ying's face went pale as he urgently hissed to a nearby man; he vaguely sensed that even he might not be this youth's match, so he did not hesitate to summon aid.

The man heard the command and without hesitation turned and rushed into the city lord's mansion.

The unbearable screams continued, but gradually weakened; eventually there were none left.

The golden light slowly retracted, revealing the area once more.

Everyone stared; when they saw the scene, their legs went numb with terror...

Centered on Yang Kai, within a radius of ten zhang not a single living person remained; all who had surged at him were slain on the spot, dying gruesomely.

The scene was brutally bloody; the dense stench of blood rose, making people gag.

A hundred zhang away, the onlooking warriors stood dumbstruck; some kept rubbing their eyes, instinctively rejecting what they had seen.

Behind Yang Kai, the old man and the green-clad girl and the others were also stunned, staring blankly at Yang Kai's back with their mouths agape.

The green-clad girl's delicate body trembled—half from fear and nausea, half from an inexplicable excitement.

Earlier Yang Kai had told her to come to the city lord's mansion to make trouble and to act as a diversion; she had agreed at once, but now she realized Yang Kai needed no one to flank him—he alone could wipe out the entire city lord's mansion!

The scene fell into an eerie silence; a breeze passed, carrying the scent of blood to every corner of Bibo City.

Few had seen such a mass slaughter: severed limbs and shredded flesh flying about, entrails and fresh blood covering the ground—terms like 'bloody' and 'cruel' no longer sufficed.

Shan Ying and the members of the Elder Council nearly collapsed.

"Kill him!"

"Kill them!"

"Young Brother, well done—don't let any of them live; wipe them all out!"

Suddenly, a roar of anger rose from the crowd a hundred zhang away.

The call met resounding echoes; the entire city resounded with this cry from people's hearts.

The warriors of Bibo City had had miserable years—extorted by the city lord's mansion and wantonly abused by those people; even if they wanted to leave and find another path, they couldn't.

Many had been killed. Many small families had been exterminated; some young, beautiful women had been violated and abducted and dared not resist.

They had had enough.

A mere city lord's mansion of Bibo City—they might once not have cared much.

But they dared not defy the Lingxiao Sect!

Three years ago, on Dark Star the three top powers—the Battle Sky Alliance, the Leitai Sect, and Star Emperor Mountain—were crushed to powder under the iron heel of the Lingxiao Sect, which leapt to become the strongest force on Dark Star.

It was a sect that inspired awe and terror.

With the Lingxiao Sect's shadow behind Bibo City, these warriors, however discontented, dared not openly resist.

Anger and hatred are like fine wine—the longer sealed, the fouler and stronger it ferments.

Today's scene released all the pent-up grievances in everyone's hearts; they began to support Yang Kai's actions, venting their fury and wishing to see Shan Ying and the others receive their due.

Someone bravely stepped forward and strode to stand behind Yang Kai, glaring at Shan Ying and the others.

More people followed.

The taboo that no idle person may set foot within a hundred zhang of the city lord's mansion was thunderously broken.

A black-clad mass of people shouted "Kill!" in unison; the gathered killing intent shot into the sky and forced Shan Ying and the others to stagger back, horrified.

Even a Void King Realm expert standing here would likely be unable to face such momentum.

Shan Ying had never imagined that those who usually obeyed him would dare shout at him like this; his legs trembled.

“City Lord, was it?” Yang Kai sneered coldly as he looked ahead. “Will you kill yourself, or shall I do it for you? I’ll warn you first—if I have to make a move, you might suffer a bit before you die. It won’t be quick.”

Shan Ying's eye twitched as he bared his teeth and snarled in a fierce yet inwardly fearful tone, "Kid, do you know whom you've offended today? I serve Lord Liang Yong of Battle Sky City; Bibo City is under the jurisdiction of the Lingxiao Sect. No matter who you are or where you come from, if you offend Bibo City today you will have no good end. The sensible should leave at once—this city lord could let it pass, but if you do not, you'll be in for it!"

“Lingxiao Sect?” Yang Kai let out a light laugh. “Don’t you dare tarnish the name of the Lingxiao Sect. Lingxiao Sect would never do the things you lot have done.”

"You don't believe me?" Shan Ying ground his teeth.

“You tell me—do you think I believe you?” Yang Kai sneered.

“Who dares be so bold as to ignore the Lingxiao Sect!” A furious shout suddenly rang out from within the City Lord’s mansion. “I would like to see—after the lessons learned by the Battle Sky Alliance and the Leitai Sect—who still dares stand against the Lingxiao Sect!”

Hearing that voice, Shan Ying, whose face had been wan, was suddenly overjoyed; he turned toward the city lord's mansion as a drowning man clutches a life-saving straw, his previous fear swept away.

A flash of grimness passed through Yang Kai's eyes as he also looked in that direction.

After a short while, someone strode out of the city lord's mansion with an imposing mien, commanding without anger.

Behind him, one Origin Returning Realm expert after another followed, their expressions arrogant.

Shan Ying hurriedly cupped his fists in salute to Lord Liang.

He had just sent word to Liang Yong and hadn't expected the other party to arrive so swiftly via a Space Array.

Now there was hope.

The experts from Battle Sky City were far more formidable than those of Bibo City; however great the lad's prowess, before Lord Liang he would likely be forced to yield.

"Hm." Liang Yong nodded faintly, glanced at Shan Ying and snorted coldly, "You are becoming an increasingly useless city lord. I heard someone was making trouble here, and you couldn't settle it?"

"Forgive me, Lord Liang!" Shan Ying broke into a cold sweat and hurriedly said, "That troublemaker's strength is extraordinary; dozens of my subordinates were brutally slaughtered by him. I ask Lord Liang to render justice for me."

"Now that I have come, I will of course not stand idly by. Who dares cause trouble and refuse to give face to my Lingxiao Sect?" Liang Yong snorted coldly.
