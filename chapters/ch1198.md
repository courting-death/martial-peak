## Chapter 1198 — The Man of Great Fortune

At the woman’s words, the four of them were momentarily stunned. They realized she was right — they all knew firsthand how unbearable the Heat-Flame Zone was. Back then, the five of them had gone through tremendous hardship to break through it and reach the area of Heaven and Earth Treasures. How could someone as weak as a mere First-Stage Saint King like him have made it across?

"Senior Sister Shen, do you know the reason?" The four of them looked at the beautiful woman with curiosity.

The beauty shook her head. "I don't know for certain, but I feel he is a man of great fortune!"

"A man of great fortune…" The four men and women around the beauty exchanged glances.

Senior Sister Shen gave a soft chuckle and pursed her lips. "You might not believe me if I said it aloud, but I truly believe in these matters. Some people are simply born with better luck, while others are born with worse fate — that makes their personal opportunities different. So you can have fighters of the same innate aptitude who walk very different paths in life. Over the years I've seen quite a few people with strong fortune; whenever I stick close to them I tend to gain some benefits myself."

The freckled man’s mouth twitched and he hesitated. "Senior Sister Shen, do you mean that if we bring him along we might receive some unexpected benefits?"

"That's exactly what I mean. Think about it: a First Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior who can pass through the Heat-Flame Zone is already a miracle. I don't think he relied purely on his own skill; he must have found an exceptionally safe path to penetrate into the heaven-and-earth treasure area. Otherwise, at his cultivation he simply couldn't have forced his way past the final blockade of the Heat-Flame Zone. What carried him through was most likely his fortune." The beauty’s voice was gentle; though her words alone weren't decisive proof, they sounded immensely pleasant to hear. "Of course, this alone isn't enough to prove everything. And as you know, something happened later in the stone chamber."

"The stone chamber…" The group thought back and naturally remembered Yang Kai’s performance and the events he’d gone through; for a while they found it all rather incredible.

"Remember how I thought the Soul Cleansing Divine Water would be allocated by Qu Changfeng and that he wouldn't gain anything from it? I even advised him not to waste time and to leave early — but who could have predicted how things turned? In the end everyone still had to immerse themselves in that pool. No matter how much benefit he obtained, it wasn't nothing. Tens of thousands of warriors enter the Flowing Flame Sandland; at least three or four thousand reach the heaven-and-earth treasure area, yet only around thirty-some benefited inside the stone chamber — and among them he alone was a First Stage of the Saint King Realm!"

"Hearing Senior Sister Shen say that, his luck really does seem quite good." The freckled man stroked the short beard on his chin and nodded lightly, appearing to find the beauty’s words reasonably persuasive.

Luck is such an ethereal thing, but by any measure that First Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior’s fortune could hardly be poor.

"Senior Sister, there's a saying: when evil reaches its extreme, good fortune follows. What if his fortune runs out…" One of the other female warriors in the group murmured with quiet concern; there is no endless prosperity and no inexhaustible luck in the world.

"So what? Bringing him won't cost us anything. If he really can help us find something good, we'll share a portion with him; if not, then our luck simply wasn't good enough." The beauty smiled carefree.

"Since Senior Sister says so, then let's bring him along." The freckled man, seeing her insistence, stopped objecting. Indeed, as the beauty said, taking him along did not risk much; at worst they’d share some spoils with a lone First Stage of the Saint King Realm — how much could he demand?

If they really encountered some great danger, he could fend for himself; after all, Senior Sister Shen said he was a man of great fortune, so he shouldn't die so easily.

Once the freckled man spoke, the others fell silent. Under the beautiful woman’s lead, they moved forward.

Yang Kai retracted his Divine Sense, his expression odd.

A man of great fortune? He couldn't help but let out a faint, wry smile.

Finding that stone chamber had some connection to luck, but more to his own skill and boldness; he wasn't afraid of Qu Changfeng, so he lingered. Any other man would likely have left long before and never gained anything.

And getting through the Heat-Flame Zone… was that really so difficult? That had nothing to do with luck, did it?

Still, now that he knew why they had followed him, Yang Kai's displeasure eased. They bore no malice; in fact, they meant well.

But he refused to act together with them. They thought he would be a burden; he thought they would be a burden. It was freer and more convenient to be alone, and if he found anything good he wouldn't have to share.

The beauty and her group were not far from Yang Kai; perhaps after receiving the distributed spiritual liquid they had rushed over immediately, so before long the five of them appeared within his sight.

To avoid misunderstandings, the senior sister called out cheerfully from a distance, "Little brother."

Yang Kai feigned surprise at discovering their presence and immediately showed a trace of caution as he slowly rose.

"Little brother, don't be alarmed!" The beauty seemed to have anticipated this scene; her seductive face beamed a friendly smile, her clear eyes bright as she chirped, "We mean you no harm."

Saying so, she and the other four strode quickly toward Yang Kai.

When they reached him, Yang Kai asked coolly, "What do you want?"

"Heh heh, nothing much, we just saw you were alone and came to take a look." The beauty answered with a charming smile. "Did you come here by yourself?"

"Sort of." Yang Kai nodded indifferently.

"Truly impressive." The sweet scent about the woman and the sweetness of her voice made the compliment sound sincere; to her mind Yang Kai likely came from a minor family that had at most three quotas for entering the Flowing Flame Sandland. The other two probably couldn't pass the Heat-Flame Zone, but he had pushed into the second area — naturally admirable.

"If the miss has something to say, speak plainly." Since he understood their intentions he had no desire for subtleties; he simply planned to refuse directly when the time came.

"Quite the temper!" The freckled man couldn't help but sneer; in his view Senior Sister Shen's willingness to bring the young man along was proof of his own good luck, yet the fellow still showed no gratitude.

"Miss…" The beauty smiled when she heard Yang Kai address her that way — she hadn't been called 'miss' in a long time. She replied affably, "We're from the Qiantian Sect…"

After naming her sect, the beauty gazed at Yang Kai as if to imply her sect's strength wasn't minor. She introduced herself, "My name is Shen Shitao, and these are my junior brothers and sisters. I saw you venturing here alone; little brother, you may not understand the dangers of the heaven-and-earth treasure area. Not only are there many demonic beasts, but there are countless strange formations and traps. With your cultivation it is dangerous to walk alone — one careless step could cost you your life."

At this point she expected him to panic and fear, and for her to offer a few words of comfort and easily recruit him. Unexpectedly, Yang Kai remained expressionless, acting as if he knew nothing of the world's dangers.

Shen Shitao privately groaned and wondered what family he came from; he truly seemed ignorant of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

With no other choice, she went straight to the point. "If you want, you can come with us. There are five of us; while not particularly powerful, it's surely better than you risking everything alone. If we find anything good we'll not neglect you — the Qiantian Sect's disciples are well regarded and none of us are bullies. What say you, little brother?"

Yang Kai pretended to ponder and was about to politely decline, but his brows furrowed and he turned his head to look aside.

Not far off, a flash of vermilion light streaked like thunder toward them and in an instant swept past the group.

Flowing Flame Fireblaze? Yang Kai's first thought was that it might be that, but he quickly rejected that guess — the vermilion light was different from the Flowing Flame Fireblaze he'd seen before. Its speed wasn't slow, but it certainly wasn't as fast as a Flowing Flame Fireblaze, and Yang Kai’s Divine Sense could pick up its trace.

Besides, they were in the second area of the heaven-and-earth treasure region; how could there be a Flowing Flame Fireblaze here?

Wei Guchang had said that Flowing Flame Fireblaze only exists in the Heat-Flame Zone and cannot appear in the heaven-and-earth treasure area.

As Yang Kai noticed the vermilion light, Shen Shitao and the others also saw it.

The freckled man stared where the red light had vanished and, after thinking for a moment, suddenly cried out, "A heaven-and-earth spiritual object?"

The rest were visibly moved.

Yang Kai had also realized what it was: indeed some sort of heaven-and-earth spiritual object, though its exact category couldn't yet be determined. When that red light flicked past, Yang Kai clearly sensed a strand of vitality — whatever it was, it had life.

Before Yang Kai could move to chase it, a figure came rushing hurriedly from the direction the red light had flown.

"Huh?" Seeing the person's face, Yang Kai couldn't help but grin and remained still.

The man quickly reached them. He'd been wary — after all, he was chasing a treasure and was suddenly blocked by six people — but upon seeing Yang Kai among them he relaxed and hurried up.

"Guest Elder!" Yang Kai greeted at once; the man was none other than Chang Qi of the Haike Family. "Yang Kai, you're here too." Chang Qi was excited, laughing as though he'd seen a relative.
