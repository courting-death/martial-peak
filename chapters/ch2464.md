## Chapter 2464 — Passion Unchanged

The Emperor Extinction Pill had always been a rare item. Even though Feng Xi was the Young Sect Master of the Wenqing Sect, it was impossible for him to have more than one Emperor Extinction Pill. The one he had was already used up, and now, without the Emperor Extinction Pill, Feng Xi was nothing more than a sickly cat—someone Yang Kai no longer needed to spare a glance.

Even before entering the Shattered Star Sea, he could easily crush cultivators of the same level, and was considered invincible among those in the Dao Origin Realm. Inside the Shattered Star Sea, he comprehended the Divine Ability of the Great Emperor of Time and subdued the Mountain and River Bell. Both his Divine Sense and Origin Qi had grown tremendously.

Yang Kai believed that if he were to face Feng Xi’s Emperor Extinction Pill now, he would never be as embarrassed as last time.

“Senior Brother Yang, you must not be careless. Feng Xi is no longer the same as before…” That Ice Heart Valley female disciple quickly reminded Yang Kai when she saw he didn’t take Feng Xi seriously.

But before she could finish, Yang Kai suddenly looked up toward a certain direction in the void and shouted in a deep voice, “They’re here!”

“They’re here?” The three Ice Heart Valley female disciples were startled and all looked in the direction he was staring, but even when they released their Divine Sense, they couldn’t detect anything at all.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, “My Star Seal is a Seven-Pointed Star Seal, so I can sense things from much farther away than you can.”

“Feng Xi also has a Seven-Pointed Star Seal!” One of the Ice Heart Valley disciples’ faces turned pale. “If Senior Brother Yang can sense them, then Feng Xi can definitely sense us too. How many people are coming?”

Yang Kai said, “I sense two, so that means there should be three!”

If Feng Xi also had a Seven-Pointed Star Seal, then Yang Kai naturally couldn’t sense his presence. But what puzzled him was that Feng Xi actually had a Seven-Pointed Star Seal! How did he manage that?

He himself had only managed to obtain a Seven-Pointed Star Seal by collecting dozens of Star Seals left behind by dead cultivators in the void rift. Could Feng Xi have killed dozens of people? Though his strength was impressive, he wasn’t that formidable, was he? In the Shattered Star Sea, which cultivator was easy to deal with?

While he was still puzzled, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense had already swept over the auras of three people rapidly approaching. One of them felt especially familiar—it was definitely Feng Xi.

In the next moment, Yang Kai’s eyes widened in shock. “What… When did Feng Xi break through to the Emperor Realm?”

He clearly sensed a distinct Imperial Aura swirling around Feng Xi. Although the power within him wasn’t yet fully stable, he had definitely advanced to the Emperor Realm.

This discovery shocked him even more than when he learned that Zi Yu was breaking through here.

He had only spent a year and a half in the void rift, yet such tremendous changes had occurred outside?

First Zi Yu had begun her breakthrough, and now Feng Xi had already advanced to Emperor. What about the other sect geniuses? Had they also advanced or were they in the process of advancing?

“It’s precisely because Feng Xi has already advanced to the Emperor Realm that we sisters are no match for him. We could only flee in embarrassment. Fortunately, his Realm isn’t fully stable yet, or we’d have no way to escape at all,” that Ice Heart Valley disciple said with a bitter smile.

Yang Kai suddenly understood and realized why she had said earlier that Feng Xi was no longer the same as before.

The difference between the Dao Origin Realm and the Emperor Realm was only a single Realm, but it was as vast as the heavens and the earth.

“Senior Brother Yang, you should leave quickly!” That Ice Heart Valley disciple urged anxiously. “Feng Xi holds a grudge against you. If he sees you, he definitely won’t let you go.”

“If I leave, what about you?” Yang Kai glanced at her.

The woman replied, “Feng Xi has been chasing us not to kill us, but to force Senior Sister to submit. So, in fact, our lives aren’t in danger.”

Yang Kai said, “Even if Feng Xi doesn’t intend to kill you, right now Zi Yu is breaking through. Do you think Feng Xi will just sit by and do nothing?”

The Wenqing Sect cultivates the Dao of Emotion. If Feng Xi wants to obtain Zi Yu, he must have absolute strength to suppress her. So no matter what, Feng Xi won’t just watch Zi Yu succeed in her breakthrough. He will definitely try to interfere. Because once Zi Yu succeeds, he’ll lose his advantage.

But at such a critical moment, how could anyone dare to interfere?

If the person interfering controls their strength just right, Zi Yu might fail her breakthrough but survive. If not, she could die under the might of heaven and earth.

Either outcome was unacceptable for Zi Yu.

The three Ice Heart Valley female disciples had clearly thought of this as well. After Yang Kai’s question, all three wore worried expressions, not knowing what to do.

“Maybe we could take Senior Sister’s place and make Feng Xi give up?” one of them suggested bitterly.

The other two women’s faces turned pale, but they remained silent.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “It’s not that I want to discourage you, nor that you aren’t beautiful, but do you really think Feng Xi, who has countless wives and concubines, hasn’t seen all kinds of beautiful women? Since he’s set his sights on Zi Yu, he won’t give up so easily. You could say that Zi Yu is a hurdle in his heart, one he must find a way to overcome. The three of you can’t take her place.”

“Then what should we do? Fight them?”

Yang Kai let out a faint, cold laugh and said calmly, “Don’t worry. If they really dare to come, I’ll make sure they never return.”

As soon as he spoke, the three women stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, their faces full of surprise.

If Yang Kai had said this before knowing Feng Xi had advanced to the Emperor Realm, it might have been due to lack of information. But now, after learning Feng Xi’s true strength, to still say such a thing sounded incredibly arrogant.

No matter how strong Yang Kai was, he was still only in the Dao Origin Realm.

How could a Dao Origin Realm cultivator oppose an Emperor? They weren’t even on the same level. If they really fought, Yang Kai would surely die a miserable death.

Seeing their strange expressions, Yang Kai knew what they were thinking, but he didn’t bother to explain. Instead, he grew serious and said, “The power of an Emperor Realm cultivator is extraordinary. Zi Yu is at a critical moment in her breakthrough and can’t be disturbed in the slightest. So, I’ll find a way to lure Feng Xi away. The three of you just focus on guarding and protecting Zi Yu.”

“Senior Brother Yang, are you planning to…” One Ice Heart Valley disciple suddenly covered her red lips, looking at Yang Kai with both gratitude and shock, as if she understood his intentions.

He was clearly willing to risk his own life to create space and time for Zi Yu’s breakthrough.

Her expression suddenly turned solemn as she said, “Senior Brother Yang, I’ll go with you!”

Yang Kai frowned, “What could you do by coming with me?”

She bit her red lips and said, “Whatever Senior Brother Yang can do, I can do too.” She looked as if she had put life and death aside.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh. “No need, I can handle it alone.”

After speaking, without waiting for her to argue further, Yang Kai flew straight toward the void, leaving behind a final sentence: “Watch over Zi Yu carefully. Observing an Emperor Realm breakthrough at such close range will be of great benefit to you. Don’t miss this opportunity!”

As his words fell, he had already disappeared.

The three Ice Heart Valley women were left anxiously staring into the void, unsure whether they should go help him.

But now that Zi Yu needed someone to stay and keep watch, they didn’t dare act rashly. They were as anxious as ants on a hot pan.

In the void, the three Wenqing Sect members racing this way were all full of high spirits. The one in the lead was none other than Young Sect Master Feng Xi.

Ever since Feng Xi advanced to the Emperor Realm half a year ago, the three of them had been practically invincible in the Shattered Star Sea. Thanks to Feng Xi, his two followers had also upgraded their Star Seals to become Six-Pointed.

As for Feng Xi, he possessed a Seven-Pointed Star Seal! One could imagine how many people they had killed and how many Star Seals and treasures they had seized during this time.

The power of the Emperor Realm had made Feng Xi supremely confident. He felt as if there was no one under the heavens who could be his match.

As they sped along, Feng Xi suddenly frowned, stopping in the void and narrowing his eyes to look ahead.

“Young Sect Master, what’s wrong?” The other two quickly stopped as well, looking at him suspiciously.

Feng Xi said calmly, “Someone is coming to meet us.”

Hearing this, a sallow-faced young man’s expression turned fierce as he snorted coldly, “Who is courting death, daring to bar the Young Sect Master’s path!”

The other, a middle-aged man dressed as a scholar, added, “Probably some fool who doesn’t know any better. Just kill him!”

Feng Xi nodded lightly, “Of course he’ll be killed. But this person’s aura… feels very familiar, as if I’ve met him somewhere before.”

As he spoke, Feng Xi suddenly felt an intense sense of unease. His heart pounded wildly, making his mind unstable. This shocked him greatly. Ever since he advanced to the Emperor Realm, he had never felt this way no matter how many enemies he faced. He thought he had reached a state of perfect calm, but now his heart was rippling.

Who could it be? Feng Xi suddenly grew concerned, narrowing his eyes as he looked ahead.

In a moment, a brilliant light shot over from the distance and landed not far from the three Wenqing Sect members. As the light faded, a face that Feng Xi both recognized and hated appeared before his eyes.

“How is this possible?” Feng Xi’s face changed dramatically as he stared at Yang Kai in shock, unable to believe his eyes.

Two and a half years ago, when they first entered the Shattered Star Sea, he and Yang Kai had been teleported to the same place. Knowing he was no match for Yang Kai, he had decisively used the Emperor Extinction Pill. With one strike, Yang Kai’s aura vanished completely, and he thought Yang Kai had died with no remains left.

In the more than two years since then, he had never once encountered Yang Kai again, nor had he heard a single rumor about him.

This annoying fellow had almost faded from Feng Xi’s memory.

But now, he appeared before him like a ghost, looking completely unharmed.

How could this be? A Dao Origin Realm cultivator had taken the full force of his Emperor Extinction Pill and survived? Feng Xi's mind was nearly thrown into chaos and he blurted out, “Are you a man or a ghost?!”

Yang Kai grinned, revealing a mouthful of white teeth, and said, “It’s been over two years, and the Young Sect Master’s passion is as strong as ever. The first thing you ask is such a sensitive question—how am I supposed to answer that?”
