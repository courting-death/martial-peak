## Chapter 1623 — Enlightenment

"I'll rest a while and I'll be fine, it's nothing serious." Yang Kai saw her on the verge of tears and, knowing she worried for him, hurriedly comforted her.

Xia Ningshang nodded ever so slightly, her eyes rimmed red.

"Are there any pills that restore Divine Sense? Give me whatever you have!" Yang Kai reached out his hand to her.

Xia Ningshang hastily rummaged through her Spatial Ring and soon produced dozens of jade bottles of various sizes!

She had been diligently refining pills in the Small Xuan Realm during this time; materials were plentiful and her results were remarkable. The spiritual pills in those jade bottles were all for restoring Divine Sense, with grades ranging from Saint King-Grade to Origin-Grade Upper-Level.

If those pills were left out in the open, they would unquestionably be a vast fortune.

"This Minor Recovery Pill is the best; I managed to form pill patterns on a few of them—use these first." Xia Ningshang picked up a jade bottle, opened its lid for Yang Kai, and poured out several pills.

Yang Kai took them without a word, popped them into his mouth and swallowed.

With a wave of his hand he swept all the jade bottles into his Spatial Ring, then sat cross-legged and began to meditate.

Little Senior Sister held her breath and quietly stepped a little away from Yang Kai to avoid disturbing him; her long lashes trembled as she stared fixedly.

Visibly, Yang Kai's complexion began to recover, and Xia Ningshang then confirmed he truly was all right—only his Divine Sense had been excessively depleted.

As long as Yang Kai was safe, she could put her mind at ease.

Inside the Xuan Realm Pearl Yang Kai meditated to recover, but one strand of his Divine Sense spread outside the Xuan Realm Pearl, alertly sensing the surroundings to prevent any mishap.

As the master of the Xuan Realm Pearl, he was able to do this.

Yang Kai was not certain whether this method could ward off Luo Hai; that man was a Second-Stage Void King Realm expert—the most powerful enemy Yang Kai had encountered since his cultivation began!

If he were to notice any trace of the Xuan Realm Pearl’s existence, Yang Kai would truly become a turtle trapped in a jar.

A figure streaked past tens of li away from the enormous meteor where the Xuan Realm Pearl lay, vanishing in the blink of an eye.

Luo Hai!

He indeed had not discovered the Xuan Realm Pearl. Instead he tracked off in a direction he judged likely.

Yang Kai felt a measure of relief but dared not relax; while he frantically absorbed the pills' effects to restore his Divine Sense, he continued to remain vigilant.

After a short while, Luo Hai returned from the front and sped past on the opposite side, fifty li away from the enormous meteor.

The terrifying Divine Sense of a Second-Stage Void King surged like a tide, sweeping through the void across tens of thousands of li, inch by inch, leaving nothing untouched.

His eyes were like a hawk's, emitting a keen light as if he could see the farthest reaches.

Slowly, his gaze fell upon the enormous meteor where the Xuan Realm Pearl lay.

Yang Kai could not help but hold his breath, his heart secretly tense.

Fortunately Luo Hai soon shifted his attention and continued searching elsewhere; he clearly had found nothing.

But he was a Void King Realm expert; when Yang Kai suddenly vanished from that spot, Luo Hai did not believe Yang Kai could slip from his Divine Sense in an instant. He was convinced Yang Kai still hid nearby—only he did not know what method was masking his aura and life force so that even an expert like him could not perceive it.

"Interesting!" Luo Hai murmured. His figure cut back and forth across this void of tens of thousands of li, searching every suspicious place, while loudly calling, "Kid, I know you're hiding here, but you think this will let you escape me? Delusional. Come out obediently and hand over the Imperial Treasure and the Void Mind Crystal; I'll let bygones be bygones. I'll spare your life—if I have to root you out myself, hm..."

Yang Kai heard his shout and remained unmoved.

Since Luo Hai had already torn off his pretenses, he would never let him go; otherwise if today's matter were spread about it would damage his reputation.

Moreover, whether the Imperial Treasure or the Void Mind Crystal, both were matters of great consequence—how could Luo Hai leave Yang Kai alive?

Once he obtained those two items, he would inevitably burn the bridges behind him.

Yang Kai cursed Luo Hai inwardly as hypocritical and despicable.

Back on Cuiwei Star, Luo Hai had left a good impression; as a star lord and a Second Stage Void King Realm expert he had appeared unassuming and approachable, but now, in private and without others present, he finally revealed his true face.

Had it been any other Origin Returning Realm cultivator, they might have caved under the pressure Luo Hai exerted and walked right into his net, hoping for a sliver of mercy.

But Yang Kai knew that would only lead to quicker death.

Half a day passed as Luo Hai prowled these tens of thousands of li, pacing back and forth several times, searching every spot and every meteor thoroughly, yet finding nothing.

This enraged him to no end.

He himself began to doubt whether Yang Kai truly still hid here, or if the kid had already slipped out of his control.

He suddenly halted, his expression dark as if a decision had been made; he ground his teeth, "Kid, you have forced my hand—don’t regret it when you reach the underworld!”

After speaking he abruptly stretched out both hands, fingers splayed, forming a ring before him.

Horrifying Saint Yuan boiled forth from his body; from his ten fingers pale white light burst, converging toward the center.

The Saint Yuan inside him seemed to find a vent and poured out, gathering along those ten streams of pale white light.

In the blink of an eye a white energy orb no larger than a fist appeared before Luo Hai.

Though not large, that orb surged with a terrifying power capable of annihilating heaven and earth.

And as Luo Hai poured Saint Yuan into it, it continued to grow.

The Divine Sense Yang Kai had left outside the Xuan Realm Pearl sensed this and inwardly cried foul; he knew Luo Hai was going to get serious and, uncertain what to do, forced himself to remain calm and watch.

After ten breaths, the pale white orb between Luo Hai's hands had become the size of a washbasin.

Luo Hai gave a faint, savage laugh and thrust his hands forward.

The pale white orb drifted forward as if weightless, flying straight a hundred li away.

In the next moment a blinding white light erupted from that spot, filling an area spanning ten million li with its radiance, and centered on that light, within a range of tens of thousands of li everything struck by it was pulverized in an instant, vanishing into the void.

Countless meteors suspended in the starry sky were vaporized as if gasified; even a nearby small dead star began to fracture and dissipate.

A full-power strike from a Second Stage Void King Realm expert—its might was truly terrifying!

Luo Hai remained motionless, his Divine Sense expanded as he observed the surroundings.

He believed that as long as Yang Kai still hid nearby, death would be inevitable.

With his Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivation, it would be impossible to withstand such a frenzied assault.

As for the Void Mind Crystal and the Imperial Treasure, they were no ordinary things and could not possibly have been destroyed by such an energy eruption.

Luo Hai did not need to take Yang Kai alive; he only needed those two treasures!

Everything within the tens of thousands of li had been cleared. What made Luo Hai change color was that not only was there no sign of Yang Kai's life force being extinguished, there was also no trace of the Void Mind Crystal or the Imperial Treasure.

"Not here at all?" Luo Hai's face darkened and his mood instantly sank.

He slowly turned his head and looked toward a certain direction in the void.

At that location something seemed to have been swept up by the violent energy and was rapidly flying off into the distance!

Luo Hai frowned, puzzled and uncertain.

That one strike of his had obliterated everything in the vicinity—so what was this thing that had actually survived it?

Whatever it was, it was likely no ordinary object.

Seeing prey, Luo Hai gleefully gave chase.

When his gaze returned to the place where the Xuan Realm Pearl sat, Yang Kai knew the situation had worsened.

He hastily called out a quick goodbye to Xia Ningshang, stuffed a handful of pills into his mouth, and rushed out of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

In the next moment Yang Kai appeared in the starry sky, snatched the Xuan Realm Pearl, tore forward with both hands and plunged into the space rift.

"So you really are here!" Luo Hai roared, transforming into a streak of lightning as he pursued.

But Yang Kai soon disappeared from sight; when Luo Hai re-sensed his aura, Yang Kai had already reached five thousand li away!

"Your use of spatial power has advanced?" Luo Hai changed color and did not dare delay, charging toward where Yang Kai had gone.

Yang Kai quickly noticed this as well.

Now a single rip in space could see him escape five thousand li—and this was not even his limit; he still had reserve strength.

Being chased like this by Luo Hai, continually tearing space to flee, seemed to greatly aid his cultivation of spatial power!

A sudden realization dawned on Yang Kai.

Spatial Force surged about him; he once again reached out, tore open space and stepped through.

When he appeared again he silently calculated the distance moved this time.

Five thousand five hundred li!

Wild joy shone in Yang Kai's eyes; he could not help but laugh aloud.

He suddenly realized this was an opportunity—an opportunity to risk death and thereby squeeze out his potential.

He stood in place, waited a moment, and when Luo Hai drew within a certain distance he deliberately performed a space tear and departed unhurriedly.

Six thousand li!

Six thousand five hundred li!

Seven thousand li!

…

“Young brat, you’ve gone too far!” How could someone like Luo Hai not grasp Yang Kai’s intent? This boy was actually using the pressure he exerted to temper and cultivate his Spatial Power even as he fled!

To Luo Hai this was a great humiliation!

A warrior versed in Spatial Force was indeed hard to deal with. Had it been any other Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, they would likely have been annihilated by now.

Yet Yang Kai could play a cat-and-mouse game with an expert like Luo Hai.

Luo Hai's face went ashen; his fists clenched until his knuckles paled.

When had he ever suffered such an affront?

In the Star Domain, apart from those few ancient undying forces, he was the strongest. Even Wudao had once remarked that among all Void King Realm experts, he was the one most likely to be the first to ascend to the Third Stage.

This was the supreme honor!

Such an expert, yet helpless against an obscure kid—Luo Hai was nearly driven mad.
