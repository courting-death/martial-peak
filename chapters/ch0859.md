## Chapter 859 — Relentless Pursuit

In the endless snow mountains, suspended in midair, Xueli's face flickered with unease as she stood there.

Yu Mo stood nearby, eyes alert and scanning their surroundings.

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan, together with their friends and followers, lingered below, all looking up.

“Brother Zhang, she’s been standing there forever and hasn’t made a sound. Has that brat slipped away?” Cao Guan murmured, a thread of unease creeping into his voice.

Zhang Ao's expression was grim; his divine sense radiated outward without pause. “I don’t know, but I can’t detect that boy’s aura… That woman’s methods are stronger than mine—maybe she discovered some trace.”

“That boy’s growth is terrifying. Last time we chased him we could still barely keep up, but this time we can’t latch onto his trail at all—and… his cultivation has even reached the Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!”

Zhang Ao drew in a breath. “That’s why leaving him alive is a disaster waiting to happen! No matter what, we must kill him this time, or he’ll grow up and come back for us.”

“You’re right… I just hope that woman isn’t all bark and no bite.”

Their voices were barely audible; naturally they didn’t want Xueli to overhear, for they wouldn’t dare speak so freely about a demon general if she could hear them.

After a long moment, Xueli suddenly opened her beautiful eyes, a puzzled, suspicious look crossing her face.

Her cultivation was exceptional. Although she couldn’t comprehend exactly how Yang Kai could move a hundred li in an instant and completely conceal his aura, her own keen sensitivity still picked up traces of him.

What puzzled her was that Yang Kai didn’t seem to be in this world at all but in some other space—an unfathomable, eerie place she dared not probe further with her divine sense.

The sensation was like standing at a distance, gazing at him as only a vague silhouette—unreal and boundless.

She gave a cold snort. “You think that if you hide, I can’t touch you?”

With that she set her hair in motion; strand after strand of jet-black hair fell from her head, Demon Yuan clinging to each strand until they writhed and transformed into ferocious fang-like poisonous snakes that lunged forward.

Seeing her move, Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and the others stiffened and all raised their heads.

An eerie scene unfolded before their eyes.

The space in front of Xueli seemed to become a calm lake; the fang-snakes plunged into it, ripples spreading outward, and they all vanished.

No one knew where they had gone.

Even Xueli wore a pensive expression. This technique had tracking and attacking properties, but only if one could lock onto Yang Kai’s traces.

She rarely used it, even against powerful foes—each casting cost her many strands of hair. Xueli was a demon general, but she was also a woman; lost hair could never truly grow back, and if she used this ability too often she might end up bald.

She couldn’t accept such a state.

But this time, to force Yang Kai from his hiding place, Xueli had no choice but to pay the price.

Even so, she couldn’t precisely pinpoint Yang Kai’s location. Fortunately, the Divine Sense and Demon Yuan clung to the hair strands, and the attacks would autonomously seek out Yang Kai and strike—she needn’t guide them.

She ground her teeth and sneered internally, determined that if she forced Yang Kai out she would make him suffer.

In the void, Wu Jie was still recovering; he lacked Yang Kai’s massive resources, so his recovery naturally required time.

Yang Kai observed that strange, abyss-like space, trying to discern any special features.

Suddenly a prickling alarm rose within him; every pore tightened, the hairs on his body bristled—something dangerous was stealthily approaching.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted and he focused, sensing around him.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

A sharp tearing sound split the void; from that distant emptiness it seemed hundreds of grotesque poisonous snakes were swimming through the air toward his position.

From the nature of those snake-like attacks, Yang Kai detected Xueli’s aura!

Each snake contained horrifying power; a hundred of them descending together made Yang Kai feel a sudden, chilling brush with death.

Wu Jie snapped awake and urgently asked, “What’s happening?”

No sooner had he spoken than he shuddered.

“Sect Master, we should go!” Yang Kai’s face darkened; he couldn’t fathom how Xueli would launch attacks into this void—an expert at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm was truly fearsome.

But it seemed Xueli herself hadn’t come; perhaps she couldn’t enter. Yang Kai felt slightly relieved.

He sliced open a tear in space and hurriedly slipped through.

“Wait for me!” Wu Jie yelled and immediately followed.

No sooner had they left that chaotic void than Yang Kai cursed out loud, “Damn bitch!”

At that moment, Xueli’s divine sense locked onto him again, like a maggot clinging to bone—utterly hard to shake off.

A hundred li away, Xueli chuckled sharply; her pretty face twisted, and her eyes snapped toward Yang Kai’s direction as she bared her teeth. “I thought you’d never show your face again!”

With a flick of her body she was gone.

Yu Mo hastened to follow.

Zhang Ao and Cao Guan exchanged helpless looks and quickly deployed movement techniques to chase after them.

During this chase they felt like marionettes, with no will of their own—forced to follow Yang Kai like dust in his wake.

“Has that woman overtaken us?” Wu Jie asked, seeing Yang Kai’s grim expression.

Yang Kai gave him a faint look and nodded slightly.

“We’re done for!” Wu Jie forced a bitter smile.

“Sect Master Wu, you can still back out now,” Yang Kai said, frowning at him.

“Back out of what?” Wu Jie asked in surprise.

“Cut ties with me and serve that woman like Zhang Ao and Cao Guan.”

“Saint Lord, you must be joking. Although I’m a schemer, serving her would be like courting death… Zhang Ao and Cao Guan are destined to be cast aside by her. If I throw myself at her feet, I’d be sealing my own fate.”

“Oh? So you see far ahead,” Yang Kai said in astonishment.

“Years ago I said I had no particular talent except knowing the right time to act…” Wu Jie chuckled.

“Fine. You have two choices.”

Wu Jie’s expression changed and he cupped his hands. “Please, Saint Lord, instruct me.”

“Separate from me and save yourself. Xueli is after me now—she likely won’t bother with your fate. Before she catches me you can run for your life!”

Wu Jie frowned; he didn’t answer immediately and instead asked, “And the second option?”

“Stay with me.”

“I’ll follow you!” Wu Jie replied without hesitation.

Yang Kai stared at him in surprise. Wu Jie laughed: “Saint Lord, you look angry and vexed but not panicked—you must have a way out. While I might have a sliver of hope if I run, if you’re captured I won’t survive. Xueli won’t spare me, and Zhang Ao and Cao Guan would silence me to cover their tracks… So it’s safer to stick with you. Besides, you saved my life not long ago—if I abandon you now, what kind of man would that make me?”

Yang Kai stared deeply and grinned. “You’re clever, Sect Master Wu.”

“You flatter me, Saint Lord.”

“Then let’s go.” Yang Kai raised his hand and tore open another rift; the two of them slipped through.

Arriving in that transitional chaotic space, Yang Kai felt Xueli’s attacks lock onto his aura again.

He was calm and unafraid; after determining direction he left that void with composure.

In the blink of an eye they emerged atop a snowy peak; without pausing, Yang Kai ripped space once more.

He tore the void three times in quick succession; within ten breaths they had traveled a thousand li.

Wu Jie’s eyes widened in wonder—every time they exited the void the surroundings grew colder; it seemed they were steadily penetrating deeper into the snow mountains.

After thinking a moment, Wu Jie was stunned. “Saint Lord, can you determine direction inside that void?”

“More or less,” Yang Kai answered, taking a pill and swallowing it to replenish his Divine Sense.

Wu Jie’s face grew strange; the more he associated with this Saint Lord the less he felt he could read him.

The method of tearing space was something Wu Jie had taught Yang Kai two or three years ago, yet in such a short time Yang Kai had not only grasped its essence but could also orient himself while inside it.

Wu Jie couldn't conceive how he managed it.

Wu Jie remembered that he had spent over a decade probing this technique to approach its threshold, and even then he dared not use it lightly.

Including the one time just used, Wu Jie had only ever employed it three times in his life.

“Where are we going?” Wu Jie narrowed his thoughts and stopped speculating, asking in a low voice.

“You’ll see soon enough.” Yang Kai squinted, sending his divine sense into the swirling snow to find the right bearing.

At the same time, nearly a thousand li away, Xueli raced toward them without pause, Demon Yuan churning around her body, her form a streak of lightning—absurdly fast, constantly closing the gap to Yang Kai.

She was determined to seize the Demon God Golden Blood hidden within Yang Kai’s body!

If she could obtain that blood, Xueli was confident she could square off against the current Demon Lord.

With luck she might even extract secrets about the Great Demon God from Yang Kai’s lips.

Such an opportunity only came once in a lifetime; Xueli would not let it slip.

For this she risked treading into human territory, bringing only Yu Mo with her; she hadn’t returned to Sand City for years.

From her probes it seemed Yang Kai was deliberately heading deeper into the snow mountains, which only exhilarated Xueli further.

For some reason she always felt that the place Yang Kai was heading might have something to do with the Great Demon God!
