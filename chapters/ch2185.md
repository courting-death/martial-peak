## Chapter 2185 — Untouchable

“Hahaha! You idiot, just eat my dust back there! With your pathetic skills, you’ll never catch up to this Lord in this lifetime!” Another voice rang out, arrogant to the extreme, clearly not putting Wuchang in his eyes at all. Not only that, he even called himself ‘this Lord,’ relentlessly mocking and ridiculing Wuchang as he fled.

Everyone was stunned, turning their heads in shock toward that direction, only to see two streaks of light chasing one another across the horizon, closing in within the blink of an eye.

“Gong Wenshan!” Yang Kai instantly recognized the man fleeing in front as that very formation master, Gong Wenshan.

In that instant, he had a rough guess as to what was happening before his eyes.

In front of the Time Temple, Gong Wenshan had already formed a grudge against Wuchang…

After Gong Wenshan broke the restriction at the entrance, he actually controlled it to block Wuchang from entering, ruining his chance at fortune.

At that time, Wuchang was also extremely decisive. Realizing he couldn’t enter the Time Temple, he simply left right away.

But… whether he’d been lying in wait on Two Seasons Mountain for Gong Wenshan to come out, or had just happened to run into him later, no one knew. In any case, judging by what happened before, it was clear Wuchang wouldn’t let Gong Wenshan off. The two clearly had a deep grudge.

Yet for some reason, even someone as strong as Wuchang couldn’t do anything to Gong Wenshan, and had been chasing him all the way here.

Just as Yang Kai’s thoughts were in turmoil, Gong Wenshan soared over everyone’s heads and landed lightly. His expression turned serious as he reached into his Spatial Ring and drew out several jade talismans. Muttering under his breath, he poured Origin Qi into them, and the talismans transformed into streaks of light that shot out in all directions before vanishing from sight.

At the same time, the area where Gong Wenshan stood seemed to become rather unusual. Everyone could feel a threatening aura coming from there.

“Formation Talisman!” someone in the crowd shouted.

Though no one knew exactly what kind of formation talismans Gong Wenshan had just used, he didn’t even bat an eye as he directly threw out three or four at once, clearly well-resourced. As expected of a disciple from a formation family—something others could only dream of having one of, he had more than he could use.

After deploying the formation talismans, Gong Wenshan made no further moves, just stood there, gasping for breath, and even took out a few pills from his Spatial Ring to swallow.

Judging by his appearance, he’d probably been chased by Wuchang for quite a few days and was greatly exhausted. Now, he planned to use the protection of the formation talismans to recover a bit…

Boom…

Wuchang arrived right after, landing a dozen zhang in front of Gong Wenshan, eyes blazing as he stared ahead. His whole body was brimming with Origin Qi, nearly on the verge of rampaging, and he radiated an overwhelming violent aura that made no one dare approach.

The weaker cultivators, upon feeling this wild aura, were even more terrified, their faces turning pale.

“Come out!” Though Wuchang was furious, he wasn’t stupid. The man had just deployed so many formation talismans right in front of him and stood there calmly, clearly confident in them. So he didn’t dare charge in recklessly, only shouting from a distance.

“You come in!” Gong Wenshan replied with a lazy air, even beckoning at Wuchang like a madam soliciting customers.

“If you’ve got guts, come out here!” Wuchang roared.

“If you’ve got guts, come in!” Gong Wenshan shot back.

“Come out!”

“Come in!”

The crowd was speechless.

“Waaahhh…” Wuchang was nearly driven mad with rage, unable to stop himself from roaring.

His enemy was right in front of him, yet he couldn’t do anything about it, especially with so many people watching. For someone as domineering as him, how could he endure such humiliation?

With a furious roar, two beams of light—one crimson, one white—suddenly erupted from his body, soaring into the sky like twin Jiao, twisting and coiling around each other as they pierced the clouds. In the next instant, they spiraled downward, crashing toward Gong Wenshan’s position like falling meteors.

Clearly, he had lost all patience for trading words with Gong Wenshan. In a fit of anger, he lashed out without hesitation.

Gong Wenshan, seeing this, didn’t change expression at all. Instead, he revealed a strange smile, forming a seal with one hand. Three zhang to his side, a solid, heavy light barrier suddenly appeared.

Rumble…

The red and white energies crashed down, hitting the barrier dead on. The barrier caved inward for a moment, but quickly rebounded, not only deflecting Wuchang’s wild attack but also sending the fierce energy scattering in all directions.

“Gong Wenshan, you bastard!”

“Damn you, Gong Wenshan, you bastard!”

“Are you out of your mind?!”

The onlooking cultivators all started shouting, cursing as they dodged the rampaging energy heading their way. They didn’t dare curse at Wuchang, but they let Gong Wenshan have it without mercy.

At the same time, Yang Kai’s face turned cold. Ignoring his injuries, he shot to his feet and reached forward.

In an instant, a pitch-black hole appeared in the void ahead, pure nothingness, like a beast’s gaping maw, swallowing all the stray energy.

“Brother Gong, watch yourself!” Yang Kai glared at Gong Wenshan.

If he hadn’t acted just now, the rebounded energy would have struck the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, and that heaven-and-earth treasure would have been destroyed.

He didn’t know whether Gong Wenshan had done it on purpose or not, but this move clearly displeased Yang Kai.

“You dare block me!” Suddenly, Wuchang shouted, his gaze icy as he looked around, finally fixing on Yang Kai, murderous intent surging.

Yang Kai frowned and said, “Brother Wuchang, what madness is this? Did you not see what just happened?”

He had no idea what Wuchang was suddenly up to. Maybe, unable to do anything to Gong Wenshan, he was just venting his anger on others to save face, or maybe he just wanted to let off some steam…

Anyway, after everyone blocked the rebounded energy, Wuchang’s expression changed.

“I don’t care! Whoever blocks me, I’ll take their life!” Wuchang replied domineeringly. “If you don’t want to get hurt, get lost!”

At these words, some people really did retreat in fear.

“Ha… Wuchang!” Xia Sheng suddenly grinned, looking at him mockingly. “If you want that Spiritual Medicine, just say so. Why put on such a show? You think if you say that, everyone will leave so you can have it all to yourself?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s face darkened. Looking more closely at Wuchang, he suddenly realized that although the man’s face was full of rage, his eyes were extremely calm…

Maybe, just as Xia Sheng said, the reason he was suddenly acting so unreasonably was just to lure others away and make a move for the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus!

This guy—what a deep schemer!

He’d probably set his sights on the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus as soon as he arrived. After all, revenge could wait, but with such a precious spiritual medicine right in front of him, who wouldn’t want it?

Wuchang’s furious expression instantly calmed. He glanced at Xia Sheng and said coldly, “You think you’re clever?”

Xia Sheng let out a mocking snort. “That’s still better than someone pretending to be crazy and playing dumb!”

“Hmph, since you’ve seen through it, there’s no need to waste any more effort. I want that spiritual medicine!” As he spoke, Wuchang’s figure flickered, about to charge at the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus.

But just then, a clear, pleasant voice suddenly rang out: “Brother Wuchang, wait! That spiritual medicine can’t be touched!”

At the sound, Wuchang actually froze in place, making no further move. Yang Kai, who had been tensing his Origin Qi, secretly breathed a sigh of relief. He’d already prepared to fight Wuchang if necessary, but now, with just a word from the newcomer, Wuchang was pacified for the moment, which was just what he wanted to see.

Wuchang was wild and unruly—almost no one could make him behave. In the entire Four Seasons Land, if there was anyone he’d give face to, it was only one person: the Radiant Moon Great Emperor’s beloved daughter, Princess Lan Xun!

So as soon as Lan Xun spoke, Wuchang held his ground, turning to look in the direction of the voice and saying in a deep tone, “Princess, you’d best give me a good explanation!”

The implication was clear: if her explanation didn’t satisfy him, he wouldn’t give her any face, even as a Princess.

“Hmph, how dare you speak to the Princess like that! You’re courting death!”

Wherever Lan Xun appeared, Xiao Chen was sure to follow, and this time was no exception.

With a low shout, a man and a woman descended from the sky. The woman was stunningly beautiful, the man dignified and extraordinary. Who else could they be but the two from Star God Palace?

Lan Xun shone like the bright moon. Not to mention her status, her looks alone were enough to drive men mad. Wherever she went, she was always the center of attention.

This time was no different. Countless cultivators’ gazes turned to her, their eyes full of admiration and awe.

Lan Xun seemed long used to this and showed no discomfort at all. Instead, it was Xiao Chen who glared around, using his oppressive aura to make the others quickly avert their eyes…

“If Brother Wuchang wants an explanation, that’s no problem.” Lan Xun first glanced at the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, then turned to Wuchang.

“Speak!” Wuchang said coldly.

Lan Xun didn’t mind, smiling as she said, “Is there anyone here who recognizes this spiritual medicine?”

Xia Sheng shrugged. “Nope.”

Most people also shook their heads, giving Lan Xun plenty of face.

Zhuang Bufan, who was still healing, suddenly spoke up: “I have a guess, but I’m not sure. But since Your Highness has spoken, you must know what it is. I won’t show off, so please enlighten us, Princess!”

“Yes, yes, Princess, if you know, please tell us.”

“Your Highness is so learned, truly admirable!”

“It’s rare to see someone so beautiful, gentle, and even-tempered. Truly a blessing for our Southern Territory!”

Lan Xun hadn’t even revealed the answer yet, but the flattery was already pouring in…
