## Chapter 2367 — Stop Pretending To Be An Old Hand

"You can stay here if you want, but it’s a thousand Source Crystals a day," the woman continued.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, and he said, “Didn’t we already pay for the boat ticket?”

Although he wasn’t short on Source Crystals now, he still couldn’t agree with the woman’s way of doing things. Charging for a room on top of the ticket fee was just too greedy.

“A ticket is a ticket, a room is a room. There are free rooms, but would you stay in them?”

“What’s the difference?” Yang Kai couldn’t figure it out. Why were there paid and free rooms on this ship? The room in front of him didn’t look that great, so why charge for it?

The woman explained, “This room is equipped with a special Purification Array. It can cleanse the transforming force of the Jixu Secret Realm. The array isn’t of the highest grade, but it’s good enough for cultivation.”

Good enough for cultivation? Yang Kai’s heart stirred, and he finally understood why the martial artists on this ship could maintain their cultivation.

It was because of this Purification Array. Having cultivated here before, Yang Kai knew the kind of harm that mysterious force could cause martial artists; that force was called the transforming force.

With just a few words, the woman had cleared up many things for Yang Kai.

So, charging for the room made sense. The Purification Array in the room cleansed that strange transforming force, so martial artists inside could absorb Spiritual Qi without restraint.

But Yang Kai quickly noticed something wrong. The Spiritual Qi in the room was extremely thin, far less than the Qi outside.

It seemed this Purification Array wasn’t omnipotent. While it purified the transforming force, it also blocked the flow of Spiritual Qi into the room.

In such an environment, one wouldn’t suffer from the transforming force, but it was impossible to maintain one’s cultivation. The array could only slow the decline unless there was another way to restore Origin Qi, such as using Source Crystals.

No wonder all the martial artists on this multi-deck ship had weak auras. Even though they had Dao Origin Realm cultivation, Yang Kai had observed that they couldn’t display their true strength.

“Are you going to stay or not?” The woman saw Yang Kai’s mind wandering and impatiently asked.

“Stay, of course!” Yang Kai quickly nodded. Even though the Purification Array was low-grade and the room wasn’t great, at least it could cleanse the transforming force. It was better than nothing.

Anyway, he wasn’t short on Source Crystals. After killing Yao Changjun, he’d found over a hundred million Source Crystals in his ring.

“Pay for a month first. We’ll settle up later if there’s any difference.” The woman reached out to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai didn’t object and directly handed over forty thousand Source Crystals to the woman.

The woman swiftly stored the Source Crystals in her Spatial Ring and warned, “Don’t wander around. We’re out here on a mission. Once it’s done, we’ll take you back to Tongtian Island.”

Yang Kai nodded, “We understand.”

Only then did the woman turn to leave. At the door, she suddenly stopped, looked back at Yang Kai, and said, “Aren’t you curious why I brought you here to collect Source Crystals?”

Yang Kai was stunned, not understanding what she meant.

The woman snorted, no longer speaking, and simply stretched out her hand toward Yang Kai. “Give me another Source Crystal, and I’ll tell you why.”

The veins on Yang Kai’s forehead bulged. He thought this woman was truly obsessed with money, charging Source Crystals for everything.

He calmly took out a Source Crystal and tossed it to the woman.

The woman caught it casually, then a mocking smile appeared on her face. “Watch closely.”

As she spoke, she threw the Source Crystal directly out of the room.

With a ding, the Source Crystal landed in the corridor.

Yang Kai’s expression changed when the Source Crystal dissolved at an astonishing speed. In less than ten breaths, a whole Lower-Level Source Crystal vanished without a trace, turning into Spiritual Qi and disappearing.

The woman snorted coldly, “You’re new here, so just act like it. Stop pretending to be an old hand!”

With that, she walked out and closed the door behind her.

Yang Kai’s face reddened, knowing his lie had been exposed. She must have realized he wasn’t from this world when he tried to give her a Source Crystal outside. Otherwise, how could he not know such a basic fact?

“Senior Brother…” Liu Qianyun’s pretty face also changed. “That Source Crystal…”

Yang Kai said ruefully, “Source Crystals probably can’t be exposed outside the Purification Array, or they’ll quickly disappear.”

That woman had asked for the last Source Crystal just to show him.

“So, they know we just arrived here?”

Yang Kai chuckled awkwardly, “They definitely know, but it’s fine. That woman may seem cold, but she’s not a bad person. Let’s rest for now. When they head back to Tongtian Island, we’ll go with them and look for a way to leave this place.”

“Okay.” Liu Qianyun nodded and found a spot in the room to sit cross-legged.

……

On the deck, after the woman came out, two men immediately appeared, flanking her on both sides.

The man on the left had a huge scar running from his cheekbone to the corner of his mouth, looking fierce and terrifying. The man on the right was burly, with a menacing aura.

"Sister Ling, those two… have settled in?" the man on the left asked softly, his eyes flickering dangerously. As he spoke, he licked his lips as if a delicious meal were before him.

“Mm.” Ling Yinqin nodded slightly, glanced at him, and said coldly, “Why are you asking?”

The man on the right chuckled, “Sister Ling, you know why. That man and woman are clearly new to the Jixu Secret Realm, probably stranded here by accident. Newcomers often have plenty of good stuff.”

The man on the left nodded, “That’s right, Sister Ling. We’re down to just a few dozen Source Crystals. If we don’t get more, our cultivation will decline. You know what it’s like on Tongtian Island. Now that two fat sheep have arrived… heh, the brothers are getting restless.”

“Is this just you two, or does everyone feel this way?” Ling Yinqin stopped and asked in a deep voice.

The man on the left scratched his head, “No one’s said anything, but I’m sure everyone’s thinking it. If you give the word, we’ll go grab them right now.”

“Bullshit!” Ling Yinqin shouted angrily, spraying the scarred man’s face with spit. “Put away your greed and stop causing trouble.”

The scarred man wiped his face awkwardly and complained, “Sister Ling, just talk, don’t spit on me…”

Ling Yinqin snorted, “Want me to throw you into the sea to cool off?”

The scarred man was startled and quickly waved his hands, “No, no, please don’t!”

Ling Yinqin took a deep breath and said, “That man is not someone to provoke. Since you know they’re newcomers, you should also know that every person who first arrives here is not easy to deal with. Unlike us, who have lived here for so long that our cultivation has regressed, newcomers can still wield their full strength. That man is at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—who on this ship could possibly be his match? If we really fought him, at least a few of us would die. Is that what you want to see?”

The two men exchanged glances, calmed down, and slowly shook their heads.

Ling Yinqin said, “The first rule of survival in the Jixu Secret Realm is not to fight needlessly. Remember this well. Lost Origin Qi isn’t easy to recover.”

“Yes.” The two men seemed very obedient to Ling Yinqin and responded seriously.

“Besides, we’re on a mission this time. Don’t worry, once it’s done, everyone will get Source Crystals and cultivation resources.” As Ling Yinqin spoke, she took off her Spatial Ring and handed it to the scarred man. “I just collected forty thousand Source Crystals from that man. Go split them among everyone. Each person will get a good share.”

“Forty thousand!” The two men were overjoyed, as if forty thousand Source Crystals was a fortune.

Outside, no Dao Origin Realm martial artist would care about forty thousand Lower-Level Source Crystals, but in the Jixu Secret Realm, Source Crystals were rare treasures.

Martial artists lived here year-round and needed to consume Source Crystals, but there were no Source Crystal mines. Over time, it was impossible to make ends meet. Only those who ended up here by accident brought Source Crystals.

But not many martial artists ended up here each year, and the amount of Source Crystals they brought varied. With hundreds of thousands in Tongtian City, how could it be enough?

So, forty thousand Source Crystals was truly a huge sum for the martial artists on the ship.

Yet Ling Yinqin handed them all over without hesitation, sharing them with everyone. That’s why she, a woman, could command the whole ship and have everyone obey her.

Ling Yinqin never kept anything for herself. Such character earned everyone’s respect.

"Tell the brothers not to target those two. When we get back to Tongtian City, don’t reveal their origins. If you want Source Crystals, get them from the newcomers properly. This mission will take a while, but if you use the right methods, you might get some Source Crystals." Ling Yinqin reminded again, knowing exactly what kind of people she was dealing with.

“Got it, Sister Ling.” The two men were overjoyed, exchanged glances, and rushed toward the cabins.

Soon, the scarred man returned and handed the ring back to Ling Yinqin. “Sister Ling, we left you ten thousand Source Crystals. The rest was split among everyone. Heh, everyone said to thank you for the reward.”

Ling Yinqin snorted, “If you lot don’t cause me any trouble, I’ll count my blessings.”

“We won’t, definitely not!” the scarred man replied earnestly.
