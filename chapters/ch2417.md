## Chapter 2417 — Come Bite Me

"Don't let them fool you. Zi Yu's Yuan Yin is intact, she's still pure!" Yao Zhuo suddenly whispered in Feng Xi's ear.

Feng Xi's eyes flashed with a strange light at these words. He glanced at Zi Yu, confirming Yao Zhuo was right—Zi Yu hadn't lost her Yuan Yin and was still a virgin. Yet even so, he couldn't let it go, because at this moment Zi Yu kept her five fingers tightly clasped in Yang Kai's palm, refusing to let go.

This situation was a huge humiliation for any man, let alone for him, the Young Sect Master of Wenqing Sect.

For a sect that cultivates through emotion, the Young Sect Master's chosen woman being so close to another man wasn't just Feng Xi's personal problem. If word got out, it would be a massive blow to the sect's reputation.

"Who are you, boy, to dare oppose my Wenqing Sect? Are you not afraid of death?" Yao Zhuo stared coldly at Yang Kai, murderous intent surging in his heart. He knew if today's matter wasn't handled well, not only would the sect's reputation suffer, but Feng Xi might also develop a heart demon. The best solution was for Feng Xi to kill Yang Kai himself, but since this was Ice Heart Valley, he couldn't act rashly before things were clear.

The Emperor Realm women of Ice Heart Valley all gazed at Yang Kai with curiosity. Truth be told, they too wanted to know just who this man was. For a man to suddenly appear in their secluded valley, and to be so close with Zi Yu, even Zi Yu’s master, Acting Valley Lord An Ruoyun, found herself at a loss, unable to make sense of the situation.

She had never heard Zi Yu mention this man before.

"I'm just here to take Junior Sister Yu away. How am I an enemy of your Wenqing Sect? Senior, aren't you being a bit too arbitrary? You should speak with a clear conscience." Yang Kai snorted, then continued, "Besides, this is Ice Heart Valley. What does it have to do with your Wenqing Sect?"

“Who do you think you are, calling her Junior Sister Yu?” Feng Xi exploded in rage.

Yang Kai's gaze sharpened, his voice cold: "How I address her is none of your damn business. Why are you barking?"

Feng Xi's fury surged. He glanced at Yao Zhuo and said grimly, "Senior Uncle, I want to kill him!"

Since birth, he'd never suffered such humiliation. The woman he fancied was holding another man's hand, tarnishing his reputation, and that man was so arrogant. If he didn't kill him, how could he vent his hatred?

Yang Kai sneered, "Want to kill me? Many have tried, but they're all dead!"

"Arrogant brat!" Yao Zhuo's face darkened, his eyes blazing with anger and cold light. The pressure of an Emperor Realm cultivator swept toward Yang Kai.

The Emperor Realm women of Ice Heart Valley all looked on in surprise. Yang Kai, just a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm, was boasting so boldly in front of them. They wondered if he'd cultivated himself stupid, or was simply ignorant and fearless.

Yang Kai stood his ground, grunted, and seemed to struggle to breathe under Yao Zhuo's pressure. He sniffed and said, "Sorry—I'm young and ignorant, not good with words."

The women frowned at his words. So Yang Kai did know fear after all. Earlier, he'd seemed so defiant, but under Yao Zhuo's pressure, he wilted immediately. Clearly, he was just someone who bullies the weak and fears the strong.

A few sighs came from the crowd, as if pitying Zi Yu.

She'd chosen such a man. Who knew if Zi Yu was blinded by emotion and couldn't see his true nature? Compared to Feng Xi, this man was worlds apart. At least Feng Xi was the Young Sect Master of Wenqing Sect, a status few could match. If Zi Yu married him, even if her cultivation stalled, she'd live a stable life and might find happiness.

But if she really followed someone like Yang Kai, her future would be full of hardship.

Yang Kai looked indifferently at Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi, then sneered, "I tend to speak harshly. If I offended you just now... why don't you bastards come bite me!"

With those words, the whole place erupted.

The Emperor Realm women of Ice Heart Valley all widened their beautiful eyes, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief, as if questioning what they'd just heard. Feng Xi and Yao Zhuo's faces darkened, their fury reaching the sky.

Yao Zhuo turned to Sun Yunxiu and barked, "Great Elder, if Xi'er kills him, do any of you object?"

He didn't consult Acting Valley Lord An Ruoyun, but asked Sun Yunxiu directly, knowing An Ruoyun was too soft-hearted to be useful at a time like this.

The reason for letting Feng Xi act was also for his sake. Yang Kai and Zi Yu's behavior had already planted a heart demon in Feng Xi. Only by letting him personally kill Yang Kai could that demon be dispelled, ensuring it wouldn't affect his future cultivation. Wenqing Sect's Supreme Sentiment Art requires true emotion in cultivation, and the target must also be moved.

Hearing this, Sun Yunxiu's pretty face darkened. She snorted coldly, "This is Ice Heart Valley. Whether to kill or spare is our business. The Vice Sect Master and Young Sect Master need not interfere!"

Her icy words greatly surprised Yang Kai.

He'd thought Sun Yunxiu was on Wenqing Sect's side, a staunch supporter of Zi Yu marrying into Wenqing Sect. By rights, she should be flattering them, never opposing. But in fact, Sun Yunxiu gave Yao Zhuo no face at all. What was going on?

Though Sun Yunxiu didn't give Yao Zhuo face, she had no fondness for Yang Kai either, feeling all this trouble was his fault. When she turned to look at him, her face was full of killing intent.

Just as she was about to speak, An Ruoyun suddenly said, "Young man, you said you came to take Yu'er on someone's orders. Whose order?"

She asked without much deeper meaning, but knowing Sun Yunxiu's temperament, she realized if she didn't interrupt, her Junior Sister would definitely attack Yang Kai.

With her Second Stage Emperor Realm cultivation, if she really tried to kill, Yang Kai would have no way to resist.

No matter whose orders Yang Kai was acting on, or whether he and Zi Yu truly shared mutual affection and had come to elope, this was the outcome An Ruoyun had always hoped for. Zi Yu was her disciple—she had taught her cultivation since childhood. If not for being forced by circumstances, how could she ever have agreed to this marriage, or secretly helped Zi Yu escape? Unfortunately, fate had played a cruel joke, and in the end, Zi Yu was still captured and brought back.

Yang Kai respected An Ruoyun. She was Zi Yu's master and Acting Valley Lord of Ice Heart Valley. But her gentle, soft nature wasn't suited to leading a sect.

A true leader must be impartial, ruthless, and strong. An Ruoyun had none of these qualities, which was likely why Ice Heart Valley was bullied by Wenqing Sect and unable to resist.

Yang Kai cupped his fists and said, "Senior An, I was sent here by Senior Bing Yun to take Junior Sister Yu away!"

"What?"

"Boy, what did you just say?"

The Emperor Realm women of Ice Heart Valley all became excited, exclaiming in shock. Over a dozen beautiful eyes instantly fixed on Yang Kai, trembling slightly. Sun Yunxiu even flashed over to Yang Kai, grabbed his shoulder, and bit out, "Boy, repeat what you just said!"

"You're hurting me!" Yang Kai glanced at his shoulder, speaking coldly. His expression was indifferent, showing no sign of pain.

Sun Yunxiu's face twisted in anger, but for some reason, she forcibly suppressed her rage, took a deep breath, released Yang Kai, and stepped back a few paces, looking at him with both anticipation and nervousness.

The other Emperor Realm women of Ice Heart Valley were the same.

Yang Kai looked around and declared loudly, "I came here on Senior Bing Yun's orders to take Junior Sister Yu away!"

"Master..." An Ruoyun finally confirmed she'd heard right. Yang Kai had truly spoken Bing Yun's name. Those sacred words had echoed in her heart for three thousand years. All this time, she'd constantly recalled her master teaching her cultivation by hand, when she was carefree, relying on her master and only needing to focus on training.

But time flies, things change, and while Ice Heart Valley remained, her master had long vanished.

Not only did outsiders believe her master had perished, but even many Senior Sisters within the sect had quietly accepted it.

Yet now, hearing news of her master from Yang Kai, An Ruoyun felt her Qi and blood surge, and asked hoarsely, "Master... is she well now?"

Many beautiful eyes turned to Yang Kai, full of hope, clearly wanting to know the answer.

Yang Kai sneered, "Senior Bing Yun knows you're about to push the sect's best disciple into the fire pit, so she's in a terrible mood!"

The women all looked downcast and guilty, unable to meet Yang Kai's gaze; they turned away in shame.

"Impossible, impossible!" Sun Yunxiu suddenly screamed like a madwoman, her eyes red, glaring at Yang Kai as if she wanted to eat him. She stepped closer, gritting her teeth, "If Master is really alive, why doesn't she come herself, but instead send you, a man, to Ice Heart Valley! Boy, how dare you lie! Do you really think I can't kill you?"

"Second Senior Aunt, it's true! Senior Brother Yang was sent by the Ancestor!" Zi Yu, seeing her so fierce, hurriedly darted in front of Yang Kai.

Seeing this, Feng Xi's heart shattered.
