## Chapter 1718 — Escape

Under the watchful eyes of everyone, Yang Kai made no obvious moves; he simply closed his eyes and stood silently where he was.

Yet a pure, dense surge of soul power spread outward from his body.

The strength of that soul power was such that it caused all present to blanch in shock.

The soul power pierced the void and extended to places unknown to others.

Yang Kai possessed Spatial Force; tearing open space was always the best way to escape from a prison, but that method did not apply to Ghost Isle — that strange place existed as its own sealed space, isolated and independent. If one could not locate where Dark Star was, even if Yang Kai tore open space he would only traverse inside Ghost Isle and could not leave it.

However, having mastered part of Ghost Isle's secrets, being able to use Saint Yuan, and being the former Star Lord of Dark Star, it was not too difficult for Yang Kai to determine Dark Star's location.

His Divine Sense leapt and darted through the void; in a short while he sensed the spatial barrier between Ghost Isle and Dark Star.

He suddenly opened his eyes; Spatial Force surged turbulently all over his body. He stretched out both hands and thrust them forward.

His hands shot out like twin Jiao dragons breaching the sea, and under everyone’s watchful gaze, they plunged straight into the void itself.

Shouts of astonishment rose up. Several thousand martial artists widened their eyes and stared at the incredible sight: Yang Kai's two arms had eerily vanished — a spectacle beyond their comprehension.

In the next moment, Yang Kai suddenly bellowed.

He ripped his arms apart to the sides, and with his movement the space before him seemed like a piece of brocade being torn in two, revealing a pitch-black rift.

The rift continued to widen, and a horrifying aura poured forth from it, as if an ancient ferocious beast had opened its gaping maw, ready to devour the entire sky and earth!

Only when the rift had expanded to about ten zhang long did Yang Kai draw a deep breath and stop tearing.

But the dense Spatial Force still surged. From Yang Kai it poured out like a sharp arrow into the rift, carving a Void Passage through the chaotic nothingness that connected Ghost Isle to some spot on Dark Star.

Sha Hu was utterly dumbstruck.

A month earlier, when Yang Kai had claimed he had a way to leave, Sha Hu had not doubted him, but he also did not know the details.

Only at this moment did he truly understand what Yang Kai had to rely on.

He had cultivated an exceedingly rare spatial secret art and had mastered it to such a degree that not only could he tear space with his sole power, he could also construct a safe Void Passage!

In the entire Star Domain, few could reach such a level. Sha Hu believed that even those legendary Void King Realm experts could not accomplish what Yang Kai had.

"If we don't leave now, when will we?"

While Sha Hu was still dazed, Yang Kai's low shout suddenly reached him. He snapped back, waved his great hand, and shouted, "Follow this old man!"

Saying so, he was the first to charge into the Void Passage Yang Kai had created, his figure swallowed by darkness and nothingness.

The Sea Hall disciples followed closely behind, vanishing one after another.

The Sea Race hurried after them. As Qian Mo passed Yang Kai she nodded to him slightly. The Little Dolphin wagged its tail and emitted a string of odd tones at Yang Kai, as if urging him to hurry and follow.

After the Sea Hall and Sea God Palace's warriors had gone, the others then charged forward.

The spatial rift Yang Kai had torn open was about ten zhang long, wide enough for many people to walk side by side, so even with several thousand martial artists waiting, the evacuation was swift; in less than half a cup of tea's time the entire Ghost Isle was left with only Yang Kai himself.

After turning his head and looking around to make sure no living person remained, Yang Kai was the last to rush into the Void Passage.

Because he had personally constructed the Void Passage, Yang Kai knew its course better than anyone. Letting himself glide through the void, it seemed to take an instant and also an age; a moment later the scene before his eyes blurred and he had arrived above a stretch of sea.

The sea breeze, bearing a distinct briny scent, blew against his face. Around his ears came the cries and shouts of countless martial artists weeping and yelling — those who had escaped Ghost Isle venting their exhilaration.

From the moment they had fallen into calamity on Ghost Isle, they had believed they would never leave in this life, doomed to be exploited by Ming Yue and live out lonely days; they had never expected to return to Dark Star.

Thus when Yang Kai reappeared, many martial artists cast grateful looks toward him.

Whether or not Yang Kai had demanded some payment from them, it was true they had left the prison of Ghost Isle, and each felt the thrill of seeing the sky again.

"Yang Kai!" Sha Hu flew over and, seeing Yang Kai safe, could not help but breathe easier.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, then reached back and brushed the spatial rift behind him. The beast-like fissure began to collapse and soon vanished.

With the rift gone and the Void Passage closed, no one could again use Yang Kai's work to return to Ghost Isle.

"Where is this place? Still over the Wuyou Sea?" Yang Kai asked.

"Pang Zhen and the Sea Race have already gone to scout; news should arrive soon," Sha Hu replied.

Yang Kai nodded and waited quietly.

About an hour later, Pang Zhen and Qian Mo appeared before everyone, faces full of joy.

"Senior Uncle, this is indeed the Wuyou Sea. About ten thousand li to the west from here is our Sea Hall's main base at Black Reef Island!" Pang Zhen reported excitedly.

"Good news!" Sha Hu's face broke into a smile. "Three hundred years have passed and at last I may return home — Yang Kai, I must thank you."

Yang Kai grinned and said, "Elder Sha, you are too polite; if you truly want to thank me, then do me one favor."

"Tell me. As long as you don't ask me to betray my teachers and ancestors, I will agree to anything," Sha Hu said magnanimously.

Yang Kai was slightly moved and smiled: "It's nothing big. My Lingxiao Sect would like to trade some goods with the Sea Hall. After all, what the inland produces is very different from what the deep sea offers. I mentioned this to Chief Pang before, but the Sea Hall seemed uninterested and never gave a reply."

Pang Zhen's face turned a little awkward.

"I thought it was some other matter. Such a small thing — I can decide and agree. This kind of trade benefits everyone; the Sea Hall would not refuse. Once I return to the main base I will personally oversee it," he said.

"In that case, thank you, Elder Sha," Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Sha Hu was the previous Second Hall Master of the Sea Hall. Though he had been absent for nearly three hundred years, his prestige and seniority remained. Now that he had agreed, the matter would likely be straightforward.

"Sect Master Yang, might our Sea God Palace also participate in this matter?" Qian Mo suddenly asked with a smile.

"You wish to take part as well?" Yang Kai looked at Qian Mo in surprise.

"Naturally. Our Sea God Palace controls deep sea resources even more than the Sea Hall. If the Lingxiao Sect wants to trade with the Sea Hall, there is no reason to exclude Sea God Palace, is there?" she said.

“Of course I wouldn’t refuse. For Commander Qian Mo to say such a thing — my Lingxiao Sect couldn’t ask for anything better!” Yang Kai laughed heartily.

"That settles it then. However, the distance between inland and deep sea is great, and transporting traded goods will be costly and troublesome..."

Sha Hu nodded in agreement with Qian Mo. The reason inland and deep sea resources could not be widely exchanged was distance; this was a problem the martial artists of Dark Star could not solve.

“There’s no need to worry about that,” Yang Kai said, he had long since thought of a solution. “I’ll set up a Space Array to link the Lingxiao Sect with your two factions. Once that’s done, distance will no longer be an issue.”

Qian Mo and Sha Hu both brightened at this, and thinking of Yang Kai's ability to tear the void, they trusted his plan to lay a Space Array.

"Then I will await good news from Sect Master Yang!" Qian Mo pressed her lips into a smile.

"I await good news as well!" Sha Hu said.

While they spoke, many martial artists had already departed. The people of the Sea Hall and Sea God Palace exchanged brief words with Yang Kai, then each returned to their respective main bases.

The Little Dolphin clung to Yang Kai, reluctant to leave.

In the end Yang Kai gave it a few bottles of Huntian Pill to soothe it.

An hour later, only those seven to eight hundred martial artists who had been enslaved for ten years remained at sea, gazing at Yang Kai, waiting for his orders.

“You can make your own way to the Lingxiao Sect,” Yang Kai said. “Once you arrive, there will naturally be people to receive you. If you need to contact your families or sects, feel free to do so. Once enough supplies have been gathered, this Sect Master will return your freedom.”

"Thank you, Sect Master Yang!" hundreds of people cupped their fists in thanks.

Yang Kai nodded and said nothing further. With a flash he disappeared from the spot.

Returning to Dark Star, he could once again master this realm, possess the conveniences of a Star Lord, each movement crossing tens of thousands or even a hundred thousand li.

In less than half an hour Yang Kai had already arrived at the outskirts of the Flowing Flame Sandland.

Looking at the familiar scene, Yang Kai smiled slightly; no matter how splendid the outside world was, when body and mind were weary, there was nothing better than home.

He vanished once more; when he reappeared he was inside the Lingxiao Sect.

Without disturbing many people, Yang Kai first visited his parents to put them at ease, then went to see several elders of the Lingxiao Sect to learn about the months he had been missing and the situation on Dark Star.

The Corpse Spirit Sect had been almost completely exterminated. About half of the inland forces on Dark Star were still in a state of rebuilding; after this battle the Lingxiao Sect had truly become a flagship sect of Dark Star, one of the most powerful sects, enjoying supreme prestige.

If not for Qian Tong of Yingyue Hall, a Void King Realm expert, that "one of the most powerful" might have been removed.

With a Void King Realm expert stationed at Yingyue Hall, it could indeed stand toe to toe with the Lingxiao Sect.

Moreover, many great forces and families on Dark Star wished to ally with the Lingxiao Sect and look to it for leadership; Ye Xijun agreed on behalf of the sect.

It could be said that the Lingxiao Sect had long since surpassed the former Star Emperor Mountain in strength and prestige.
