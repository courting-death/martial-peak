## Chapter 1836 — Your Opponent Is Me

Sha Hu and Yang Kai had met on Ghost Isle and were somewhat acquainted; Lie Kong, because of trade relations with the Lingxiao Sect, also knew Yang Kai. The last time Yang Kai left the seabed, the Sea Race's little princess had even given him a Sea God Pearl, within which a Source of an Ocean was contained — ideal material for cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword.

Seeing Yang Kai now, both Sha Hu and Lie Kong were instantly overjoyed, yet at the same time wracked with anxiety.

Sha Hu hurriedly said, “Yang Kai, get out of here at once — this man is not someone you can stand against!”

“Elder Sha, rest easy.” Yang Kai smiled faintly at him. “Since I came, I naturally did not come unprepared. Besides, he came for me, so you two were merely caught up in it. Elder Sha and Palace Lord Lie Kong, please withdraw.”

As he spoke, he waved his hand.

An invisible force wrapped around Sha Hu, and in the next instant he found himself and the many experts of the Sea Hall transported ten thousand li away, while the bubble enclosing Lie Kong suddenly burst with a single flick.

When Lie Kong came to his senses, he was already safely back in the Sea God Palace.

“Palace Lord!” Many Sea Race masters rejoiced and rushed forward; several venerable elders hurriedly took out healing holy medicines from their Spatial Rings and administered them to Lie Kong.

“Star Lord? You even refined the Stellar Origin of this Cultivation Star?” The middle-aged man’s eyes brightened; he looked at Yang Kai with some surprise.

If he were not a Star Lord, then with Yang Kai only at the First Stage of the Void King Realm it would have been impossible to perform the marvel he had just seen. At the moment Yang Kai waved his hand, the man distinctly sensed fluctuations of Law power.

“What? Sect Master Yang is actually the Star Lord of the Dark Star?” Though they watched from afar, the people of the Sea Hall and the Sea God Palace heard the middle-aged man's words clearly; all of them were startled, then their faces flushed with excitement.

Especially Lie Kong and Sha Hu, when they learned Yang Kai was the Star Lord of the Dark Star, the despair that had filled their eyes rekindled into hope.

If he were a Star Lord, then under this sky it truly might be possible to contend with this inexplicable enemy!

“Brat, I'm talking to you — are you deaf?” The middle-aged man’s face darkened when Yang Kai still ignored him. He ground his teeth and hissed.

Considering his own lofty status and tremendous strength, the idea that a mere youth at the First Stage of the Void King Realm would refuse to respond when he spoke enraged him and humiliated him.

Only then did Yang Kai turn his head to glance at him, casually picking at his ear. “What did you just say? Sorry, the sea breeze is strong — I couldn't hear clearly. Say it again.”

Sha Hu and Lie Kong wore exasperated faces…

They had all heard clearly from ten thousand li away; Yang Kai was right beside him — how could he not have heard? This was plainly contempt.

Inwardly, they couldn’t help feeling a surge of satisfaction—Yang Kai had truly brought glory to the cultivators of Dark Star. Yet at the same time, they were secretly uneasy. Was it really wise to provoke such an opponent?

“Arrogant brat!” The middle-aged man sneered. “Allow me to congratulate you — you've successfully angered me. You will not die so easily later.”

“Whether I die or not has nothing to do with you. But you—you’re the one who’s about to die.” Yang Kai chuckled darkly, facing an opponent whose depth he could not fathom, yet showing not the slightest hint of fear.

“Your guts are admirable, but guts without strength are meaningless.” The man raised a finger and waved it before him. “Brat, hand over the Warm Spirit Lotus and the Star Chart obediently. If I’m in a good mood, I may spare you an intact corpse; otherwise, I will not hesitate to let you taste every human torture.”

“You want them? Come and get them if you can.” Yang Kai's expression did not change.

“Incorrigible!” The man showed little patience. Seeing Yang Kai's stubbornness, he snorted and unleashed a vast, pure Divine Sense from his Sea of Consciousness, thrusting it toward Yang Kai.

Whether it was the Warm Spirit Lotus or the Star Chart, both were in Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness; should the man attempt to seize them, he would have to start by invading the Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Kai's face finally changed; he felt something slam violently into his Sea of Consciousness. A wave of dizziness and nausea swept through him, his face paling.

Boom…

The invisible impact caused a ring of sealing formations to flare up within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness. Accompanied by mysterious prohibitive forces, they directly halted the middle-aged man's Divine Sense from entering.

“What?” The middle-aged man was also greatly surprised.

He had thought that with his own strength he could easily penetrate the other's Sea of Consciousness and seize the Warm Spirit Lotus and Star Chart. Who would have known that this brat's Sea of Consciousness contained a forbidding power that made even him shudder, blocking his intrusion.

“Brat, you hide many secrets!” The man looked at Yang Kai with unpredictable menace on his face. “Very well — once I capture you I'll study you thoroughly!”

Saying so, he suddenly reached out to grab Yang Kai.

Within a few zhang around Yang Kai, space seemed locked; a force bound him tightly and attempted to pull him toward the middle-aged man.

Sensing danger, Yang Kai frantically urged his Space Secret Technique while simultaneously rousing the power of the Stellar Origin within him. The force of that origin shattered the surrounding seal, and with a shift of his footing, he vanished from where he stood.

“Easy there, easy there—your opponent isn’t me.” When Yang Kai reappeared a hundred zhang away, he looked at the middle-aged man with a leisurely air, a trace of gloating curling his lips.

“Ridiculous. Is there anyone here stronger than you? Even you don’t dare to fight me—who else could possibly stop me?” The middle-aged man sneered coldly, unmoved.

“Your opponent is me!” A clear female voice suddenly rang out from the void; it was ethereal, as if coming from every direction.

The middle-aged man turned pale with shock and bellowed, “Who is skulking about? Show yourself!”

Ripples rose in the sky like a still lake struck by a stone. From the very center of the disturbance, a woman in a black robe strolled out. Close behind her was a little girl of fifteen or sixteen with long twin ponytails, a pretty and charming appearance.

The little girl appeared and instantly scanned her surroundings with bright eyes, then she smiled and waved at Yang Kai. “Sect Master Uncle!”

“Yun'er, come here!” Yang Kai waved back at her.

Lin Yun'er glanced at Yang Yan; when she saw Yang Yan slightly nod, she changed course and hurried over to Yang Kai's side.

“Sect Master Uncle, it's been half a year — I missed you so much.” Lin Yun'er was innocent and playful, seemingly oblivious to the tense situation; she began to act spoilt as soon as she reached Yang Kai.

“Mm, Uncle missed you too… huh, wait, when did I become your uncle?” Yang Kai looked at Lin Yun'er with mock displeasure. “Call me Brother, I'm not that old.”

“Heehee, if I call you Sect Master Brother, then what would you call Aunt Yang Yan?” Lin Yun’er looked at Yang Kai mischievously.

“Forget it — call me Uncle.” Yang Kai wiped the cold sweat from his brow.

From afar, Sha Hu and Lie Kong watched with speechless looks. They wondered what was going on — why were this woman in black and the little girl acting so casually at a moment like this? And who was this woman in black; how had she appeared?

What had happened to the Dark Star? In the past there had not even been a Void King Realm, yet today powerful figures were appearing one after another like pulling up radishes — it was unbelievable.

“Sect Master Uncle, can’t you beat that bad man?” Lin Yun’er looked up at the middle-aged man in the sky and asked Yang Kai.

“I am no match.” Yang Kai admitted frankly. He could not gauge the man's depth, much less fight him. Even if he were Star Lord of the Dark Star and had the advantage of time and place, should a fight break out Yang Kai believed he would surely die.

Under heaven, only one person could subdue him!

Yang Kai turned his gaze to Yang Yan, and deep in his heart a fierce longing surged forth — the longing for the Supreme Martial Dao.

“It’s okay. Aunt Yang Yan will deal with him—and Yun’er will cultivate hard too. If anyone bullies you in the future, Yun’er will stand up for you!” Lin Yun’er patted her developing little chest and declared solemnly.

“Ha — then I'll be relying on you from now on.” Yang Kai laughed heartily.

In the sky, after Yang Yan's appearance the middle-aged man had an increasingly grave expression. For some reason he felt an overwhelmingly dangerous aura from the woman in black — an aura he could not resist. It was as if a clash with her would lead to a miserable end for him.

But Yang Yan's face was calm and indifferent as she regarded him.

Beads of sweat rolled down the middle-aged man's forehead. He drew a deep breath to steady himself, then clasped his hands and asked, “May I ask who you are?”

“None of your business.” Yang Yan answered coolly. She glanced at the patterns on his garments and frowned. “Are you of the Falling Star Sect?”

The middle-aged man trembled, astonished as he stared at Yang Yan. “You know my sect? It seems you really are from the Star Realm — could you be this Star Domain's...?”

“No!” Yang Yan cut him off before he could finish. “Since you still show some manners, surrender yourself — I don't wish to bully the weak.”

“Have me surrender without a fight?” The middle-aged man looked as though he had just heard a joke. His face darkened fiercely as he ground his teeth and said, “I don’t care who you are. Since you’re not the guardian of this Star Domain, then keep your nose out of my business. Whatever I, Wu Shengfeng, set my sights on—has never escaped my grasp!”

“Is that so? Then you'll be disappointed this time. With me here you won't take anything, and you might even lose your life.” Yang Yan remained serene and unmoved.

“Do you insist on opposing my Falling Star Sect?” Wu Shengfeng ground his teeth and hissed.

“What of the Falling Star Sect? Even that old fool Yu Heling would not dare act wanton before me — you? One little Falling Star Sect thinks it can press down on me? Ridiculous!” Yang Yan sneered.
