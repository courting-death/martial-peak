## Chapter 1596 — Into the Depths

The white-haired elder spoke thus, then glanced at Yang Kai with curiosity and laughed lightly: "Young brother, you are human, are you not? Why are you colluding with a yao woman?"

“Colluding with a yao?” Yang Kai frowned slightly. “Elder, isn’t that accusation a bit too heavy?”

The elder shook his head. "Men are men, yao are yao. Humans hunt yao, yao hunt humans; the two races are opposed by nature. Yet you now attach yourself beneath a yao woman—if that isn't collusion, what is?"

He assumed instinctively that the stronger Xue Sun occupied the dominant position and that Yang Kai merely followed her orders.

"I ask you: this yao woman claims Brother Li and his Junior Sister have perished—are those words true?" the elder's expression suddenly turned severe as he demanded an answer from Yang Kai.

"Yes. I saw them die with my own eyes." Yang Kai inclined his head slightly.

"Were you involved?" the elder narrowed his eyes; a murderous intent subtly oozed from them.

"Indeed."

"Why?"

"Because I could not stand by when I saw injustice — I drew my blade to help!" Yang Kai answered in a low voice.

Xue Sun sneered imperceptibly at his words from the side.

"Good, very good!" the elder nodded repeatedly, his tone deadly cold. "Brave enough to take responsibility — the youngster has guts. I have your face noted; remember this: the Blood Prison will be where you meet your end."

Yang Kai grinned brightly. “Elder, before you start spouting big words, you might want to see if you’ve got the weight to back them up. Careful—the wind might twist your tongue.”

The old man gave a cold chuckle. “Whether I’ve got the weight or not, I know that well enough myself. I’ve no wish to argue with you now—let me take those Domain Stones first.”

"Domain Stones?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, speaking arrogantly: "The Domain Stones are mine. Don't even think of laying a finger on them."

The elder was taken aback; the other two likewise froze for a moment, then all three burst into loud, mocking laughter.

The one-eyed man sneered. “A brat who hasn’t even grown all his hair dares to vie for a Domain Stone? You’d better hurry back and cultivate for a few more years—raise your realm before talking big again. These youngsters nowadays really don’t know their place. A mere Second Stage Origin Returning cultivator dares to come running into the Blood Prison!”

"I have no patience to trade wits with you fools. The Domain Stones are mine to claim." Yang Kai sneered, then strode toward the Domain vortex.

"Be careful!" Xue Sun's face went pale as she hurriedly warned him.

She had already experienced the vortex's terrifying power and knew full well how dangerous it was.

The white-haired elder and his two companions all stared over in astonishment. They had not expected Yang Kai to so brazenly charge into the Domain vortex — was he courting death?

The elder couldn't help but snort, a playful smile on his face. He waited for the spectacle to unfold.

He assumed Yang Kai would be torn apart by the Domain vortex!

But in the next moment, his smile froze.

That vortex they and their companions feared so greatly failed to hinder Yang Kai in the least; the brash youth strode forward step by step toward the interior as though the Domain vortex meant nothing to him.

The elder drew a cold breath, his gaze stunned; he focused all the more intently on Yang Kai's movements.

He clearly saw the Shi enveloping Yang Kai — a power not inferior to his own, perhaps far stronger. This intangible field was like a perfect suit of armor, protecting Yang Kai and allowing him to walk through unimpeded.

Thankfully, this condition did not last long. The youth advanced less than twenty zhang before his pace slowed; after another ten zhang, his figure came to a halt.

Yang Kai closed his eyes, sensing the strange fluctuations around him and pondering the mysteries of this Domain.

Seeing this, the elder finally let out a breath.

If Yang Kai had truly marched unceasingly to the center and taken the Domain Stone, he would likely have vomited blood.

Fortunately, though this youth acted strangely, he did not entirely ignore the vortex; he had to comprehend its mysteries to reach the deepest place.

There was still a chance for them! The elder's eyes flashed with killing intent as he rose abruptly, ignoring the heavy burden he bore and pushing forward a stretch.

The other two, unwilling to be outdone, likewise moved forward a distance.

The Domain vortex grows more powerful toward its center; the pressure on those within increases accordingly. If one cannot withstand it, the vortex will grind them to death.

Therefore, when warriors study the secrets inside a Domain vortex, they usually proceed according to their limits, not daring to be greedy, lest they seek their own deaths.

Before Yang Kai arrived, the three had planned to advance step by step toward the center and slowly reach the Domain Stone; they were confident in that approach.

But Yang Kai's arrival and bizarre actions alerted them to the danger. They realized that if they did not speed up, the Domain Stones might be snatched away.

The chaotic field around them made everyone reluctant to strike at others, for doing so might trigger the Domain's backlash and result in self-inflicted suffering.

If circumstances were different, the three would have certainly joined forces to slay Yang Kai first. Now the contest was simply who could first reach the vortex's center and seize the Domain Stones.

The treasure takes precedence; none would show weakness.

Outside the vortex, Xue Sun’s beautiful eyes shimmered with a strange light as she gazed at Yang Kai’s back, her heart deeply shaken.

He had marched straight into the vortex without pause, reaching within thirty zhang of the center! Each step he took struck Xue Sun like a ten-thousand-pound hammer to the chest, leaving her breath nearly suffocated.

That she had been dispatched by the Fierce Crab Domain's ruler to participate in the Blood Prison Trial meant she was the Fierce Crab Domain's strongest Origin Returning Realm expert.

The domain ruler's attention and the respect of peers at the same Stage gave her grounds for pride; she had never taken other Origin Returning Realm practitioners too seriously.

But today, she finally put aside her arrogance.

Yang Kai's performance made her recognize that, at the Origin Returning Realm Stage, she still had much to learn — there were practitioners at this Stage who looked down on her.

Gritting her teeth, Xue Sun mobilized her own Shi and stepped into the Domain vortex.

The moment she entered, her delicate body trembled. From all sides, invisible and terrifying power forced her yao essence to whirl wildly as she struggled to resist, painfully putting one foot in front of the other to follow in Yang Kai's footsteps!

But after advancing less than five zhang, Xue Sun could not move.

She glanced up at Yang Kai and was shocked to find that in the short time he had already moved forward another stretch.

How did he do it? Xue Sun could not fathom it.

Having spent less than half a day's time with him, her pride and confidence lay in tatters; she realized she could not compare to this human at all...

Xue Lian and Mi Tian were no match either.

On Di Chen Star, all the lord-level experts held Xue Lian and Mi Tian in high regard, believing these two rising stars could very likely advance to the Void King Realm and become lord-level existences.

If Xue Lian and Mi Tian had a great chance of ascending to the Void King Realm, then Xue Sun was certain Yang Kai could absolutely reach the Void King Realm.

His outstanding performance now showed that his control over Shi had reached a level that made all Origin Returning Realm practitioners sigh in envy. He might even have comprehended the Domain's mysteries.

For the first time, Xue Sun felt awe toward another Origin Returning Realm practitioner; the retreating silhouette ahead stood like an unattainable peak, forcing her to look up.

"Impossible, this is impossible!" the one-eyed man's shout rang in everyone's ears. His eyes trembled as he stared toward Yang Kai, watching him stride toward the vortex's center as if treading flat ground; even when he paused, he resumed in moments.

The powerful Domain vortex seemed utterly unable to stop him!

The one-eyed man's gaze went blank and unfocused, his face stupefied — Yang Kai's actions had shaken him to the core.

"Calm yourselves!" the white-haired elder barked, "This youth is indeed strange, but we started earlier — we're still ahead of him in distance; we may yet have a chance. In any case, we cannot let him succeed!"

At his words, the one-eyed man seemed to regain his senses, took a deep breath, and nodded heavily: "I understand."

"Is that so?" Yang Kai suddenly grinned, looking over at the white-haired elder. "Am I behind you in distance? Look again, and calculate more carefully."

As he spoke, the youth who had stood unmoving for a long while suddenly walked forward with light, effortless steps.

One step, two steps, three steps... there was no intention to stop; he cut through like a blade through bamboo, impossibly swift, closing on the center and the Domain Stones.

The elder froze, the one-eyed man froze, the third man froze.

Xue Sun cried out in alarm, her small hand covering her lips as she stared blankly toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai seemed to have suddenly understood something: his Shi wrapped him, deflecting the Domain's power back. Wherever he walked there was no hindrance.

He effortlessly arrived at the forefront of the very center.

The three elders wore frantic expressions, helpless and at a loss.

At that moment, they did not know what to do. Had this happened elsewhere, they would have thrown everything into stopping Yang Kai. But inside the Domain vortex they could only watch helplessly and do nothing.

Their faces grew ashen with hatred.

Suddenly, the elder's eyes brightened as if he had discovered something extraordinary.

At the vortex's center, Yang Kai's advancing step hung suspended in mid-air; he could not place that final stride. His brow furrowed as a look of deep thought crossed his face.

"The youngster's in trouble!" the elder rejoiced inwardly, praying the youth would remain there or be ground to dust by the Domain vortex.

He felt the Domain behaving strangely, as if most of its power had been drawn toward Yang Kai and was pressing down to crush him to pieces!

Yang Kai's expression grew grave; sweat beaded and trickled from his forehead as the invisible Domain force relentlessly battered his body.

The pressure on the three eased abruptly; they exchanged glances and then reddened their eyes as they charged forward with astonishing speed.
