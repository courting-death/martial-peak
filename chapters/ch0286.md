## Chapter 286 — Sect Leader's Crisis

Cangyun Evil Land launched a massive attack on Yao Wang Valley, abducting over a hundred disciples from Yao Wang Valley, including three elders who were captured alive. The alchemists who came to participate in the alchemy conference at Yao Wang Valley also suffered heavy losses, with countless missing.

In addition, the disciples of various major forces suffered innumerable casualties. The twelve peaks of Yao Wang Valley were littered with corpses, and blood stained this once-pure land. In the towns within the valley, countless houses had collapsed, and the losses were incalculable.

The earth groaned in agony!

Cangyun Evil Land's actions this time were a blatant affront, inciting the fury of all forces. The Eight Great Families of Zhongdu dispatched people the very next day to unite various factions, discussing a counterattack against Cangyun Evil Land to reclaim the abducted alchemists.

However, a piece of news conveyed by Xiao Fusheng left everyone in shock.

The Evil Lord has returned!

This was a phrase spoken by a master from Cangyun Evil Land in the Divine Roaming Realm just before his death.

Cangyun Evil Land covered an enormous area, filled with countless experts and demons. Due to its vastness, it was divided into six regions, each ruled by one of the six Evil Kings. Although they all belonged to Cangyun Evil Land, they generally did not interfere with each other, maintaining a peace of sorts.

Above the six Evil Kings was the supreme Evil Lord!

This position had been vacant for over a hundred years.

The position of Evil Lord was not easy to hold. The six Evil Kings were incredibly powerful, not inferior to the top experts of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu. With numerous capable subordinates, they had governed Cangyun Evil Land for so many years without anyone daring to covet the Evil Lord's throne, indicating how strict the requirements for the position were.

A hundred years ago, there was once an Evil Lord in Cangyun Evil Land, a person of profound strength and remarkable achievements, who brought suffering to countless beings. Ultimately, it was the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu that joined forces, sending their top experts to slay him at Wolf Cry Cliff!

In that battle, the experts of the Eight Great Families also suffered countless casualties!

After a hundred years of recuperation, they had barely restored their vitality.

But now, Cangyun Evil Land had unexpectedly produced another Evil Lord. How could this not shock people?

If others had spoken of this news, no one would have believed it. However, since it was Xiao Fusheng who said it, the situation was different.

The entire world instantly became turbulent, and the atmosphere grew tense as spies from various forces frequently entered and exited Cangyun Evil Land, seeking reliable information.

But the results left everyone in disbelief.

Cangyun Evil Land truly had an enigmatic Evil Lord! The moment this person appeared, he subdued the six Evil Kings with absolute strength, taking complete control of Cangyun Evil Land.

The situation was dire. People were anxious and restless.

...

At Hidden Cloud Peak, Yang Kai bid farewell to Xiao Fusheng.

He had achieved his purpose for coming to Yao Wang Valley and had not returned to Lingxiao Pavilion for a long time; it was time to go back.

Xiao Fusheng seemed to have anticipated this, his expression showing little change. He simply said, "Though I know you came to Yao Wang Valley with ulterior motives, since you have entered my Hidden Cloud Peak, you are considered a disciple of Hidden Cloud Peak. If you have leisure in the future, do come back to visit."

"Yes." Yang Kai felt a bit guilty and respectfully took his leave.

Xia Ningshang was somewhat reluctant. However, knowing Yang Kai's intention was resolute, she naturally did not try to keep him.

Moreover, Yang Kai had already told her last night about his departure and had left her a drop of Liuyan Liquid and a drop of Soul Cleansing Dew, along with a considerable amount of Wan Yao Ling Ye. Xia Ningshang had reached the Seventh Stage of the True Essence Realm, progressing rapidly, and the items left behind could greatly assist her in advancing to the Divine Roaming Realm.

As for Dong Qingyan, Yang Kai had given her a drop of Liuyan Liquid, and she should soon be able to break through to the True Essence Realm; a drop of Liuyan Liquid was enough to refine her True Essence further.

Not only that, Yang Kai had also taught Xia Ningshang the spirit formation he had gleaned from the True Alchemy Formula, which she would pass on to Xiao Fusheng.

With this spirit formation's assistance, Xiao Fusheng should be able to refine pills above the Mystery Realm.

Although they could not be considered true Spirit Realm pills, they should still satisfy Xiao Fusheng's lifelong wish.

Elder Xiao, Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan treated Yang Kai well, and his only return was this spirit formation.

Descending from Hidden Cloud Peak, Yang Kai hurriedly made his way back to Lingxiao Pavilion, expending True Essence to travel at lightning speed.

After seven or eight days, Yang Kai finally returned to the sect.

The moment he stepped into Lingxiao Pavilion, he felt something was amiss.

A faint aura of evil permeated the entire Lingxiao Pavilion.

His expression darkened, and Yang Kai quickened his pace, observing as he walked. He was shocked to find that the entire Lingxiao Pavilion was shrouded in sorrowful clouds, with traces of battle left everywhere. Many disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion were hurrying about, even carrying bundles as they left the sect.

"Senior Brother!" After observing for a long time without understanding the situation, Yang Kai quickly stopped one of them.

"What do you want!" The person initially showed impatience, but upon realizing it was Yang Kai, his expression changed to one of surprise. "You are Yang Kai?"

As he spoke, his attitude became much more respectful. A year ago, he had heard of Yang Kai's battle with Bai Yunfeng of the Bai Family.

"What happened in the sect? Where are you going?" Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

"It's hard to say." The person looked awkward, breaking free from Yang Kai's grasp, and said, "You should ask the Sect Leader and the elders yourself."

As he spoke, he hurriedly left.

Yang Kai frowned. At that moment, he suddenly sensed something and looked up to see a pure white figure flying over.

It was Su Yan.

As always, Su Yan remained cold and beautiful. After a year apart, her strength had increased significantly. With her growing power, the icy aura around her had become even more potent, capable of freezing all things in the world. Only when her gaze met Yang Kai's did a trace of warmth flicker in her eyes.

Carrying a fragrant breeze, she landed in front of Yang Kai, a slight smile appearing on her exquisite face. "You’re back?"

Yang Kai nodded slightly, anxious. "What happened here?"

Su Yan's bright eyes dimmed as she grasped Yang Kai's arm and said, "Some changes have occurred. Let's talk as we walk."

As she spoke, her body soared into the air. Yang Kai also activated his True Essence and flew alongside her.

Sensing the fluctuations of True Essence, Su Yan turned her head in surprise to look at Yang Kai. "You’ve reached the Third Stage of True Essence?"

Yang Kai grinned. "Yes."

"Your strength has improved so quickly!"

"You’re not slow either; you’ve reached the Eighth Stage of True Essence!" Yang Kai was equally impressed by Su Yan's progress. He had gained experience and opportunities outside, allowing him to advance quickly, but Su Yan had been diligently cultivating in the sect. If she had the same resources as him, her growth would likely be even greater.

Hearing Yang Kai's praise, Su Yan's cheeks flushed slightly, a look of satisfaction spreading across her face as she softly said, "The Ice Heart Technique emphasizes the cultivation of the mind. Over the past year, my mind has improved significantly, so my strength has followed suit."

Yang Kai pondered, knowing that her rapid improvement in mind must have been due to the influence of the Dual Cultivation Technique. He chuckled and leaned in to plant a kiss on her cheek.

Su Yan shot him a reproachful glance but said nothing.

"Where are we going?" Yang Kai adjusted his direction to follow her. His eyes narrowed as he frowned. "Are we going to the Sect Leader's retreat?"

Su Yan nodded slightly, her expression suddenly turning somber as she forced a smile. "The Sect Leader said that if you returned, he would take you there immediately."

"What happened to the Sect Leader?" Yang Kai noticed something was off with Su Yan's demeanor and quickly asked.

Su Yan bit her lip for a moment before softly saying, "He was injured... severely injured..."

"Who did it?" Yang Kai's expression darkened instantly. Master Ling Taixu's strength was not much inferior to Meng Wuya's. He was exceptionally talented; had it not been for the matters concerning his two disciples, he would have broken through the Divine Roaming Realm long ago.

Such a master was now severely injured, and judging by Su Yan's expression, the injury was certainly not ordinary. Who could have inflicted such harm on him?

"The Sect Leader's second disciple!"

"What?" Yang Kai's face changed dramatically as he suddenly realized. "Isn't he...?"

"Yes, but he has emerged from Dragon Confinement Ravine and has mastered an evil technique. On the day he left seclusion, he fought against all the Divine Roaming Realm experts of Lingxiao Pavilion, injuring the Sect Leader severely, killing Elder Zhou Fei on the spot, and wounding the other elders. Countless disciples died or were injured..." Su Yan's brows furrowed tightly as she sighed. "If it weren't for the Sect Leader fighting to protect us, Lingxiao Pavilion would have..."

"When did this happen?"

"A month and a half ago..." Su Yan shook her head with a bitter smile. "The aftermath of that battle has yet to dissipate, and Lingxiao Pavilion is now filled with evil energy. The disciples must constantly circulate their energy to resist it. The higher-ups are heavily injured, and some are afraid of being implicated, already packing their things to leave the sect."

Yang Kai's expression darkened as he finally understood why the sect had become like this.

However, that second disciple could actually break free from Dragon Confinement Ravine was something no one had anticipated. For hundreds of years, countless people had been sealed beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine, and no one had ever escaped safely. Yet the Sect Leader's second disciple had succeeded.

When Ling Taixu had captured him back then, he had shown mercy due to their master-disciple bond and had not killed him, only crippling his cultivation and imprisoning him in Dragon Confinement Ravine. Little did he know that years later, this would sow the seeds of disaster for Lingxiao Pavilion.

Had he known this would happen, Ling Taixu would never have spared that person's life back then.

As they spoke, the two arrived at the Sect Leader's retreat.

Before entering, a wave of evil energy rushed toward them, thick and suffocating, causing Yang Kai to frown.

"You go in. The Sect Leader has been waiting for you!" Su Yan said softly.

Yang Kai nodded, opened the door, and walked in. Upon seeing the scene before him, his heart tightened.

A year ago, when they had parted at Ghostly Underworld Mountain, Master had been spirited and full of vigor, preparing for a life-and-death battle with Gui Li from Ghost King Valley. But now, upon seeing him again, he was already haggard, his body enveloped in black aura, clearly unable to suppress the invading evil energy due to his severe injuries.

As if sensing Yang Kai's return, Ling Taixu, lying on the bed, slightly moved his fingers and slowly opened his eyes.

Yang Kai's heart raced, and he hurried forward.

In the room, besides Ling Taixu, there was also an alchemist from Lingxiao Pavilion accompanying him.

This alchemist's strength was not high, probably only at the Seventh or Eighth Stage of the True Essence Realm, and he was a disciple of the previous generation.

"Senior Aunt, how is the Sect Leader?" Yang Kai turned to ask.

The person shook his head slowly. "It's not optimistic; he probably won't last much longer... sigh!"
