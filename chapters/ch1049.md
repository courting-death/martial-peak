## Chapter 1049 — Lucky Break

Xue Yue had silently calculated everything in her heart, preparing to let Yang Kai know what it means for a toad to long for a swan — intending to use this opportunity to rid herself of his emotional knot, to make Yang Kai recognize the difference in their status, and to draw a clear line between herself and that man!

Everything was ready — all that was lacking was the east wind!

She waited for Yang Kai to take the initiative and speak.

But left waiting and right waiting, things didn't progress as she had imagined; she couldn't help but open her beautiful eyes to look at Yang Kai, and immediately her expression turned strange.

The man who had taken every advantage of her before, who had groped her all over, was now, under the temptations of a lone man and woman sharing a room, sitting there calmly with a Saint Crystal in hand, circulating profound arts to draw energy from the Saint Crystal and replenish his own consumption.

He was actually cultivating!

A heavy sense of frustration rose up; Xue Yue grit her teeth inwardly and glared at Yang Kai with hatred.

She took the initiative to speak, forcing her voice to sound calm: “I have something I can't understand — can you answer me?”

Yang Kai opened his eyes, looked at her intently, and suddenly grinned: “I have some things I don't understand too!”

“I was going to speak first!” Xue Yue cried coquettishly.

“Then you ask first.” Yang Kai was magnanimous to the extreme, not willing to get tangled up with her over that point.

Xue Yue was stunned for a moment, then asked, “What's your name? Where are you from?”

She still didn't know Yang Kai's name; thinking back on what had happened before, she felt she'd suffered a great loss.

“Yang Kai! You probably don't know where I'm from. It's a low-tier continent — I'm the first to break out from there and succeed in entering the Starry Void!” Yang Kai answered honestly.

“A low-tier continent?” Xue Yue looked at him in surprise, curiously asking, “Then what is the highest cultivation of your continent?”

“Third Stage of the Saint Realm... There once seemed to have been a Saint King before, but he perished before he could venture deeper into the Star Domain; that was thousands of years ago.”

“Only Third Stage of the Saint Realm... that really is a low-tier continent.”

“Yes. After I came here I learned there is the Saint King Realm above the Saint Realm, Origin Returning Realm above Saint King, Void King Realm...”

“How provincial and easily startled!” Xue Yue covered his mouth and laughed teasingly. “But among the short men you stand out — it's remarkable you've come this far. You've certainly suffered a lot on the way, haven't you?”

She seemed to take an interest in Yang Kai's hardships, but that realization of impropriety flashed across her face and the smile on it abruptly vanished.

“It's alright, I just accidentally wandered in...”

“No need to say, I don't care about that.” Xue Yue cut him off coldly. “What I ask is why I couldn't find you on Shuiyue Star — where were you hiding? Did someone offer you aid?”

“Oh, I stayed in Shen Tu's palace; you probably didn't look there.” Yang Kai replied casually, with no sense of betraying Shen Tu.

“Shen Tu...” Xue Yue murmured, then suddenly smiled faintly and coquettishly: “So he was the one who meddled. I see. Hmph — a few days apart and he dares to oppose me; when I go back he'll have a good time!”

She put on a venomous woman's look, baring her teeth as if she wanted to tear Shen Tu to pieces.

“Was he the one who arranged you onto that warship?” Xue Yue continued to ask.

“Yes. He thought you'd left Shuiyue Star the previous day, but he didn't expect you hadn't actually left. I boarded the warship first and you followed right after. Beauty, isn't that fate?” he said with a grin toward Xue Yue.

“Whoever's fated with you?” Xue Yue shot Yang Kai an annoyed look, full of alluring charm that stirred his heart. He couldn't help but be distracted; images of their entanglements on the Death Star and the soft, ample feel of those touches rose unbidden in his mind, and his gaze toward Xue Yue immediately changed.

“What are you thinking about?” Xue Yue's face flushed suddenly, as if she'd detected Yang Kai's filthy thoughts. Under Yang Kai's invasive gaze she felt overwhelmed and hurriedly changed the topic: “What's going on with your Divine Sense? I've been paying attention these past days — why does your Divine Sense feel strange and erratic? What secret does your Divine Sense hold?”

“That's because I'm proficient in...” Yang Kai began without thinking, but halfway through his words his expression changed. He frowned: “The power of the Soul Chain is too formidable — it seems I don't have defenses against you...”

Whatever she asked, he seemed willing to answer; a warning bell rang in Yang Kai's mind and he dared not be careless any more.

Seeing Yang Kai actually wake and recover, Xue Yue couldn't help muttering a curse, a look of annoyance crossing her pretty face.

Just a little more and she'd have found out the secret of Yang Kai's Divine Sense; unexpectedly it failed at the last moment.

“The Soul Chain is a divine art cultivated by an elder of the guild; its power is of course extraordinary. But I'm surprised you could resist it.” Xue Yue looked at him astonished.

“Are you trying to use this chance to make me reveal everything?” Yang Kai sneered coldly.

“Of course! Think about all the things you've done to me... I must find out everything about you!”

“If you hand yourself to me, I will confess even without the Soul Chain!”

“In your dreams!” Xue Yue snorted, her face flushing with fury and shame at Yang Kai’s brazen behavior.

“Enough, now it's my turn to ask.” Yang Kai smiled lightly and, giving Xue Yue no time to think, asked, “How did you disguise yourself as a man? I know some Secret Treasures can alter appearance, but you even changed body shape — isn't that a bit exaggerated?”

Male Xue Yue and female Xue Yue bore some resemblance in features, but their body shapes were worlds apart — the perky round buttocks and full breasts baffled Yang Kai, and he couldn't understand how she had concealed them.

“Also the work of a Secret Treasure!” Xue Yue replied unwillingly. “One of our guild's masters specially forged that Secret Treasure for me. It was unique! But during that catastrophe the treasure was damaged, and now I can only keep this form!”

“That's fine.”

“I think it's fine too!” Xue Yue chuckled; she seemed to quite like his womanly appearance.

“What's your current cultivation?” Yang Kai asked again.

Xue Yue frowned, reluctant to answer, but still said, “Third Stage of the Saint King Realm! I only advanced a year ago — that's a secret. Don't let it slip.”

Yang Kai pretended solemnity, counting on his fingers: “So that's one major realm and one minor realm higher than me?”

Xue Yue giggled: “Recognize the gap between us now? If I hadn't been so badly injured earlier, someone like you would be crushed by a finger from me. How dare you act wantonly!”

“How old are you this year?” Yang Kai asked, looking at her.

Xue Yue's pretty face darkened; she ground her teeth in fury: “None of your business! Didn't anyone teach you not to ask a woman's age?”

Yang Kai smiled sheepishly.

“There's another thing I find strange!” Xue Yue suddenly turned serious. “During that catastrophe I survived because of an Origin-Grade armor I relied on. Even so, I nearly died. You're only Second Stage of the Saint Realm — how could you possibly have lived through it?”

“Lucky, I guess.” Yang Kai shrugged, suddenly recalling that during the disaster Xue Yue had indeed used a crimson armor, though plates of it had peeled off.

“I don't think it's just luck!” Xue Yue stared at Yang Kai thoughtfully. “I inflicted a lot of injuries on your physical body before, but now it seems those wounds have healed. Moreover... your blood is golden, filled with an extraordinarily surging vitality and restorative power. How many secrets are hidden within you?”

Her beautiful eyes gazed at Yang Kai, her face full of curiosity.

From her perspective, such a disaster had nearly killed even her; someone like Yang Kai had no reason to survive.

“My recovery and resistance to blows are indeed quite strong. That's probably the main reason I survived.” Yang Kai smiled faintly and changed the subject: “Do you know what exactly happened this time?”

“I don’t know.” Xue Yue shook her head, a trace of gloom clouding her face. “I’m not sure whether that trap was laid against the Commerce Guild or against me. But one thing’s certain—someone inside colluded with outsiders. No matter who it was, I’ll uncover the truth and make them pay in blood!”

Saying this, Xue Yue's eyes flashed with a cold light full of murderous intent.

She seemed to have completely changed into the ruthless, cruel, cold-blooded Young Master Xue Yue who, in search of Yang Kai, wouldn't hesitate to slaughter two thousand warriors!

“And the Fragmented Star Flash used in the trap was also developed by our guild and never sold externally. If we trace it to its source, I think the truth will soon come to light.” She sneered softly.

Yang Kai grinned and privately worried about whoever pulled the strings behind the scenes. One could imagine that once Xue Yue had the time to act, she'd stir up a bloody storm over the matter.

It would likely be a cataclysmic upheaval for the entire Hengluo Commerce Guild!

Speaking in the cave, the two lost all sense of time; as they learned more about each other, both Yang Kai and Xue Yue felt the other had become somewhat more familiar.

With unhealed wounds on her body and the worry of enemy searches outside, Xue Yue did not share Yang Kai's abnormal recovery ability; after talking a while she grew weary, leaned against the cave wall, and fell into a deep sleep.

After an unknown interval she was startled by Yang Kai's soft call; she sat up quickly, frowned at Yang Kai beside him, and turned to look at the large hand draped over her delicate shoulder, asking wordlessly, “Why are you holding me?”

Yang Kai glanced at her: “You leaned against me yourself!”

“I...” Xue Yue blushed, at a loss for how to defend herself.

“We should leave. They're heading toward this Death Star — if we don't go we'll be discovered.” Yang Kai urged, standing first and pushing aside the cave mouth's obstruction, summoning the Star Shuttle and beckoning to Xue Yue.

Xue Yue stormed onto the Star Shuttle, snorting: “Next time even if I lean over, don't you dare hold me — that wasn't my intention!”

“Fine! From now on I won't care whether you live or die!” Yang Kai replied bluntly.
