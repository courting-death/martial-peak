## Chapter 1505 — Healing

Several tens of thousands of li away from the ruins of that ancient sect, there stood a desolate mountain; its spiritual qi was thin, and scarcely any vegetation grew, making the place look utterly forlorn.

Such a place rarely saw martial practitioners tread, for there were no geniuses or heaven-and-earth treasures to be found, nor anything of value to draw explorers in.

The mountain range was small, stretching only a dozen or so li, much like Dragon Lair Mountain in appearance and spiritual qi, and in both respects it was actually inferior to Dragon Lair Mountain.

A streak of rainbow light raced in from the distance; when it passed over the desolate mountain it curved and descended, plunging straight into a natural cave halfway up the slope.

As the light dispersed, three figures were revealed.

Each of them looked utterly battered, their bodies stained with blood, as if they had endured an extremely gruelling battle and narrowly escaped death.

The three were, of course, Yang Kai and Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu.

Tens of thousands of li should be far enough to be safe; it wasn't that Yang Kai didn't want to run farther, but Fei Zhi Tu's condition was grim, and he dared not delay further, so the desolate mountain offered them a place to rest.

After rushing into the cave, Yang Kai immediately set Fei Zhi Tu down to lean against the cave wall, extended his fingers to take the other's wrist, and released Saint Yuan to probe his injuries.

Of the three, Fei Zhi Tu's injuries were by far the most severe; his qi was in utter disorder, and he looked as though his life force was all but spent.

After a moment, Yang Kai's brow tightened and his expression grew sombre.

"Yang Kai, Old Fei—" Qian Tong fussed anxiously like an ant on a hot pan, unable to tend to his own wounds, he looked to Yang Kai and asked urgently.

"The situation isn't good," Yang Kai replied in a low voice, then looked up at Fei Zhi Tu and asked, "Lord Fei, what secret technique did you use that could cause such harm?"

"Heh…" Fei Zhi Tu gave a bitter laugh, his face as pale as paper, and slowly shook his head: "Not a secret technique; this old man never cultivated such a heaven-defying technique."

"Not a secret technique? Then could it be…" Qian Tong's face changed as if he recalled something.

"Indeed. When I was captured, while they weren't paying attention, I hid an Exploding Origin Pill beneath my tongue!"

"Exploding Origin Pill?" Yang Kai's expression changed; as an alchemist he had heard of this pill. It was a pill with terrible aftereffects. Though it could grant a practitioner a dramatic temporary boost in strength, once the effect faded it would inflict unimaginable damage on the body.

It drained the practitioner's life force!

Such spiritual pills were rarely concocted and even more rarely taken; to swallow one required the courage to face death and be reborn.

No wonder that even when bound by a restriction, Fei Zhi Tu could instantly break through and restore his strength—he had concealed such a pill in his mouth beforehand.

Yang Kai understood in his heart.

As they spoke, the pill's effect seemed to have completely dissipated, and the aftereffects followed immediately.

Fei Zhi Tu's hair turned snow-white before their eyes, and his skin shrivelled and dried; deep wrinkles furrowed his face.

It was as if a hundred—or even a thousand—years had flowed past him in an instant.

Fei Zhi Tu, who had previously looked only in his forties and in the prime of life, had now become a decrepit old man, ancient and near death.

Even his cultivation slipped downward, from the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm to the Second Stage, then to the First Stage, nearly falling out of the realm entirely.

"Old Fei…" Qian Tong wailed in grief; he and Fei Zhi Tu had shared a life-or-death bond for centuries and knew better than anyone where that Exploding Origin Pill had come from.

In their youth they had adventured together and had once come across an Exploding Origin Pill; Qian Tong had scoffed at it, but Fei Zhi Tu kept it. Who would have thought that two or three centuries later Fei Zhi Tu would actually use it.

For a moment, Qian Tong felt both sorrow and guilt.

If that Exploding Origin Pill had been kept by him back then, then he would be the one suffering the pill's backlash today, and he wouldn't have to stand by helplessly watching his old friend's life ebb away.

Fei Zhi Tu had already been badly wounded; now with the pill's hidden hazard erupting and his mind struck when the Blue Jade Bowl was destroyed, he truly had little time left to live.

"Old Qian, why the face as if you've lost your parents?" Fei Zhi Tu grinned weakly. "I know my own condition. This time it was our oversight that dragged Yang Kai into this, but at least it didn't become a grave mistake. My old life still has some value to pass on. Listen, Old Qian: the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect dared to defy the heavens in targeting us—there may be backing behind them."

"Backing? You mean…" Qian Tong frowned.

"This is only my conjecture; I can't be certain. Don't rush to take vengeance. Yingyue Hall is no match for them; if we clash because of this, we'll be the ones to suffer losses."

"Leave the revenge to me, Lord Fei, you just rest for now," Yang Kai soothed.

"Heh, Yang Kai, you are thoughtful. In that case I won't trouble you further." Fei Zhi Tu nodded lightly and then fell silent.

Tears welled in Qian Tong's reddened eyes, a sheen of water at the corners betraying his grief.

"Why such mourner's faces?" Yang Kai observed and chuckled, "Though Lord Fei is gravely injured, he may not necessarily pass away."

At this, Qian Tong's eyes brightened.

Fei Zhi Tu also looked up at Yang Kai in astonishment.

As he had said, he understood his own condition. If this were merely a wound, a few years' recuperation would suffice. But after taking the Exploding Origin Pill his life force had been drained and he could not prevent the deterioration; in three to five days at best, or within a few hours at worst, he would surely die.

"Yang Kai, at a time like this don't joke with me. If you truly have a way to pull Old Fei back from the gates of death, do it now and I'll be grateful for life!" Qian Tong cried, clutching at the hope like a drowning man seizing a straw.

Fei Zhi Tu also looked to Yang Kai with expectation.

Who would want to die if they could live? But given his condition, did Yang Kai really have any way to save him, or was he merely comforting them?

"I wouldn't dare joke with two elders at a time like this," Yang Kai said seriously. He flipped his wrist and took a jade vial from his Spatial Ring, opened it, and a fragrance instantly spread.

The scent filled the air, and Fei Zhi Tu's previously ashen face suddenly regained some colour; his spirit improved as well.

"What is that?" Qian Tong, being a discerning man, knew at a glance that whatever was in the jade vial was extraordinary, though he couldn't identify it.

The liquid looked pure and flawless, like milk.

"The Three Divine Waters—surely the two elders are not unfamiliar with them," Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"What? The Three Divine Waters?" Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu were both astonished.

"Indeed. This vial contains one of them, the Life Jade Nectar!" Yang Kai said as he flicked his wrist and a drop of the pristine Life Jade Nectar shot forth, wrapped in his Saint Yuan, and floated toward Fei Zhi Tu.

"The Life Jade Nectar!" Qian Tong was overjoyed; if this truly was one of the Three Divine Waters, Old Fei might not die after all.

His current state stemmed mainly from excessive life-force overdraft, which prevented him from suppressing the wounds; if his drained life could be replenished, given his cultivation he could still contain the injuries.

The Life Jade Nectar, famed as one of the Three Divine Waters, chiefly served to replenish qi and blood and restore life force.

It was precisely the right remedy.

Qian Tong's excitement knew no bounds.

"Lord Fei, please accept this!" Yang Kai intoned softly.

Fei Zhi Tu's features twitched with emotion; without hesitation he opened his mouth and swallowed the fingernail-sized drop of Life Jade Nectar.

It melted on his tongue and a warm current surged from his mouth to his abdomen; a vigorous vitality spread through his body, jolting his spirit. He closed his eyes and circulated Saint Yuan to refine the medicine's effect.

Seeing Fei Zhi Tu's qi stabilise so rapidly and his life no longer in immediate peril, Qian Tong couldn't help but shed tears of joy at his old friend's escape from death.

"Yang Kai, this gift is too great!" Qian Tong wiped his eyes and looked at Yang Kai with deep gratitude.

"Elder, your condition is severe, and Fei is also entangled by me—he took the pill to shield me from attack. I should be the one to express gratitude; a mere drop of Life Jade Nectar is nothing. As for your wounds…"

"I'm not badly hurt. I can dissolve the restriction within myself with time and meditation. As for this arm…hah, it's nothing major. Though I'm old, I'm still robust. It's only broken; it will mend."

"Very well. Then start your recovery. I have some Healing Pills here; taking them will greatly aid your recovery," Yang Kai said, producing several vials from his Spatial Ring and taking out pills to hand to Qian Tong.

Qian Tong wanted to decline—after all, as an elder of Yingyue Hall he would carry healing pills—yet upon seeing Yang Kai's offerings he swallowed his words and accepted them graciously, smiling: "What you produce are indeed fine things; I won't be rude."

“As it should be. This junior will stand guard for you two Seniors—please focus solely on your recovery!”

"Mm, you should also treat your wounds so there are no lingering troubles."

Soon the three each claimed a spot in the cave and sat cross-legged to meditate.

Fei Zhi Tu's wounds were the most severe, but with his life no longer in immediate danger how much he could recover depended on his own ability; Qian Tong's injuries were not a major issue, and Yang Kai's were negligible.

With golden blood flowing through him, Yang Kai's recovery was naturally far faster than most, and his body was extraordinarily sturdy, so even having been struck by those arcs of lightning he had not suffered great harm and merely needed some light recuperation.
