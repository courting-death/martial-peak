## Chapter 1810 — Emerging from Seclusion

A little over a month later, Yang Kai stood beaming as he looked over the vast tract of land before him; centered on the Everlasting Tree, he had already planted many Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines.

No matter what condition those Spiritual Herbs and medicines had been in before, under the nourishment of the Everlasting Tree’s vibrant life force they had all survived.

Within a hundred-li radius, a proper medicinal garden had taken shape.

“It seems that from now on, anything I collect can be planted here and taken out when needed. Hm, this will also preserve the medicines’ potency to the greatest extent,” Yang Kai said with delight.

Then he scattered countless Saint Crystals, pulverizing them with a fist into fine powder so that the energy within the Saint Crystals would suffuse this patch of space.

Although the Everlasting Tree’s life force was vigorous enough to nurture this Small Xuan Realm, the Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines he had planted still required Spiritual Qi from heaven and earth to grow.

From now on, Saint Crystals would likely become quite a considerable expense.

After finishing these chores, Yang Kai took a moment to probe the condition of the Floating Continent.

During this time he checked on it every now and then and found that the Incarnation’s refining had proceeded extremely smoothly; the entire Floating Continent had already been reduced by more than half, and the Stone Giant that spanned the void now revealed its majestic, towering form, giving off an overwhelming sense of oppression.

But the later the process went, the harder the refining became; no one knew what the Incarnation would ultimately be able to refine the Floating Continent into.

Yang Kai did not worry overmuch; instead he sat cross-legged in the medicinal garden, inhaling the fragrances wafting from all directions, then withdrew a round, plump object from his Spatial Ring.

The Jingkong Beast’s Inner Core!

He had agreed to go with Luo Lan to the Lost Realm precisely because he wanted to obtain the Jingkong Beast’s Inner Core.

The Jingkong Beast was an ancient strange beast, innately versed in Spatial Force; its aid for a warrior like Yang Kai, who cultivated Spatial Force, was unimaginable.

In the Lost Realm he had refined that spatial vortex, greatly increasing his own spatial power; if he could obtain the profound intent and secrets contained within the Jingkong Beast’s Inner Core, he would unquestionably be able to advance further.

He produced the Purple Void Cauldron and summoned Divine Sense Fire.

He intended to refine the Jingkong Beast’s Inner Core into a Spiritual Pill and swallow it; that way he could maximize the absorption of the Inner Core’s energy.

Fortunately, the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy recorded an ancient pill formula that used the Jingkong Beast’s Inner Core as the primary material for refining, and he lacked no other auxiliary ingredients.

Time flew by. Two months passed in the blink of an eye.

Outside the Floating Continent, the Ghost Ancestor frowned deeply, his expression grim, and he could only mutter to himself.

It had been more than three months since he had felt the stirrings of Yang Kai’s ascension. Yet until now Yang Kai still had not appeared.

Could it be that he had truly failed his ascension and perished under the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy? That would be a natural tragedy indeed.

At this moment the Ghost Ancestor stood alone in the void, anxiety gnawing at his heart. After all, he had only just promised Yang Kai to join the Lingxiao Sect, planning to rely on the Lingxiao Sect’s Void King-Grade alchemical masters to raise his strength. If Yang Kai had simply died like this, where would he go to find the Lingxiao Sect? He did not even know where the Lingxiao Sect was located.

Ni Guang and Xue Yue had left more than two months ago.

Ni Guang had many matters to attend to; he could not wait around forever, and after many fruitless days he had had to return temporarily to the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

Xue Yue had wanted to stay, but how could Ni Guang allow her to remain here alone? Even with the Ghost Ancestor watching, he could not be at ease, so despite Xue Yue’s strong protests he took her away.

“If you’re dead or alive, at least pop out and say something!” the Ghost Ancestor fretted, pacing and itching to plunge into the Floating Continent once more to see for himself.

On the other side, Zi Long and the others were far more patient and continued to wait.

But even their faces had grown sour.

They believed Yang Kai had certainly perished—otherwise why would he keep hiding? Whether Yang Kai lived or died mattered little to them, but the Everlasting Tree was in his possession…

“That bastard!” Zi Donglai spat angrily.

“Brother Zi, Brother Xu, I must take my leave,” Kong Fa said after a moment, addressing Xu Wei and Zi Long.

He simply lacked the patience to linger here any longer.

Xu Wei cast a dim, listless look at Kong Fa and opened his mouth as if to speak, but in the end said nothing and only sighed.

Having had his essence drained by the Skybreaking Shuttle, Xu Wei was nearly sucked dry; even after several months, he still hadn’t recovered. At this moment, he looked as if he were on the verge of burning out completely.

Xu Wei was ignored; Zi Long, of course, would not pay him any heed, only giving a faint snort.

Feeling foolish, Kong Fa forced a smile and prepared to summon his Star Shuttle and leave.

Just then, an anomaly occurred.

From the once-still Starry Sky there suddenly erupted a wave of unusually intense force fluctuations.

Kong Fa froze where he stood and stared at that spot in bewilderment, knitting his brows.

The force fluctuations grew stronger and stronger, and within less than three breaths a vortex appeared there.

“A Chaos Vortex?” Kong Fa exclaimed in alarm. The others’ faces changed drastically; even the powerful Ghost Ancestor and Zi Long hurriedly mobilized their Saint Yuan, preparing to flee at any moment.

A figure suddenly emerged from that vortex.

“Eh!” Zi Donglai shouted, staring intently at the figure; then he cried out excitedly, “He’s out! That bastard’s come out!”

If the figure stepping from the vortex was not Yang Kai, then who else could it be?

In an instant, everyone’s gaze burned hot enough to pierce the void.

“Boy, you truly aren’t dead!” the Ghost Ancestor laughed heartily; darkness around him surged and ebbed, betraying his deep excitement.

“Since you came out, come with this old man!” Zi Long lunged the moment he saw Yang Kai, purple light shimmering around him as he floated leisurely to Yang Kai’s side and reached out with one hand, saying, “Treasures like the Everlasting Tree are not something a small nobody such as you can possess.”

“You dare lay a hand on my Sect Master? Did you ask this old master’s permission first?” Ghost Ancestor snorted coldly. His figure turned into a streak of black mist, appearing before Yang Kai in an instant. The Ten Thousand Souls Banner wailed with the cries of myriad ghosts as a surge of pure, vicious energy burst forth, striking straight into Zi Long’s mind.

“Hmph, trifling tricks!” Zi Long remained unmoved like a mountain, his purple light growing even more radiant.

The Ghost Ancestor’s black vapor was forced to retreat step by step.

“Heh heh… underestimate this old man? You take yourself far too seriously,” the Ghost Ancestor hissed, and the Ten Thousand Souls Banner transformed directly into a pitch-black curtain that enveloped Zi Long.

“What?” Zi Long was greatly astonished; he had never fought the Ghost Ancestor before. Although he knew the other was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm in strength and not far inferior to himself, only when they engaged did he realize this gloomy old fellow was even more troublesome than Ni Guang.

“Boy Yang, run now!” the Ghost Ancestor’s voice echoed from within the black curtain. “I’ll block for you for a time; run as far as you can!”

“Uh… you folks sure are patient,” Yang Kai said after stepping from the vortex and glancing around. He soon understood the situation, yet he stood calmly and did not show any inclination to flee.

“Trying to run?” Zi Donglai’s face darkened; he waved a hand and ordered, “Xu Wei, take him down.”

Although Xu Wei looked like a broken man, he was still of the Void King Realm—an emaciated camel is still bigger than a horse—so Zi Donglai naturally forced him to exert himself.

Xu Wei dared not defy orders; with a cold face he charged at Yang Kai, roaring with a ferocious look, “It’s all because of you, you bastard! If not for you, how would I be in such a state?”

He had been subdued by Zi Donglai largely because Yang Kai had ambushed him in the Lost Realm, leaving him gravely wounded; otherwise, how could Zi Long have pacified him with a few words?

Void King Realm experts were all proud to the extreme; none would willingly be enslaved and forced about.

Especially when the one commanding him was a greenhorn of the Origin Returning Realm!

That alone would have been bad enough, but during the chase after Yang Kai, Xu Wei had the Skybreaking Shuttle siphon a great deal of his primordial power, causing him to age in an instant.

All of this was Yang Kai’s doing, so Xu Wei dared not take out his anger on Zi Long or Zi Donglai; he could only vent his resentment on Yang Kai.

Thus, when Zi Donglai ordered him, he threw himself forward and unleashed the full strength his current state could muster without hesitation.

The void trembled; a full-force strike from a Void King Realm expert was no trifling matter—it was almost capable of tearing the void itself.

Xu Wei sought only Yang Kai’s life.

Zi Long and his son cared only about the Everlasting Tree; whether Yang Kai lived or died was irrelevant—if they killed him, they could find the Everlasting Tree in his Spatial Ring.

Dazzling light flashed as Xu Wei became like a small sun, descending with a thunderous roar above Yang Kai’s head.

Zi Donglai’s eyelids twitched, a hint of apprehension surfacing. He had treated Xu Wei horribly lately, and Xu Wei, bound by the mark that controlled him, dared not complain; Zi Donglai had thus come to think the Void King Realm held no real power.

But upon seeing Xu Wei’s all-out strike, he realized his mindset was flawed.

A single strike like that could have wiped out more than a dozen of him in an instant.

“That bastard’s done for!” Zi Donglai delighted inwardly.

Once he eliminated this future rival, only Xue Yue and Gu Jianxin would stand on par with him; were he to subdue them in time, he could become the king of the younger generation in the Star Domain!

Lost in such fantasies, a cruel smile crept across Zi Donglai’s lips.

“Secret Art, Exile!” Yang Kai murmured. Facing Xu Wei’s earthshaking strike, he showed no change of expression and not even a hint of avoidance; he raised one hand and covered Xu Wei.

The hand radiated a profound ripple of force that, in Xu Wei’s eyes, grew immense as if becoming the heavens and earth, blotting out the light and leaving nothing but chaotic darkness.

“What?” Xu Wei cried in astonishment.

The blinding light instantaneously faded away. Xu Wei stood stunned not far from Yang Kai, staring forward in disbelief, his eyes nearly bulging from their sockets.

He had no idea what had just happened; his world-shattering, all-out strike had evidently been unleashed, yet Yang Kai remained unscathed, not a hair out of place.

It was as if the strike had hit another plane of existence.
