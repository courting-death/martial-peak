## Chapter 1464 — You Can Go and Die

Countless spatial rifts surged in from all directions; Jin Shi's face was aghast, and he was clearly begging for mercy.

Under normal circumstances, such unstable spatial rifts would hardly frighten him—he could easily destroy them with a few techniques and escape unscathed. But now, at his weakest, having just performed the Golden Cicada Shell Escape, less than third of his Saint Yuan remained. Though willing, he simply lacked the strength.

How could Yang Kai bother listening to his nonsense? If you strike a snake and don’t kill it, you deserve to be bitten—this old fool was simply reaping the misfortune he’d earned.

The dense spatial rifts soon wrapped around and submerged Jin Shi; a piercing, tragic wail issued from there. Jin Shi barely condensed a Saint Yuan to protect himself, but it did little good—the protective Saint Yuan, upon touching those rifts, was banished into the endless void, followed by his flesh and then his bones...

When the dust settled, the former elder of the Demon Blood Sect had been reduced to chunks of flesh, mutilated—at least half of his body had disappeared.

The two women from Ice Heart Valley stood there stunned.

They had assumed the battle would be one-sided and feared Yang Kai might be instantly killed; they had already readied themselves for the worst.

Little did he know that once Yang Kai finally made his move, it would shake the heavens and rend the earth.

The jade-green long sword transformed into a jade-green giant dragon that left one of the opposing experts no time to react; his strange Shi drove the other into a dead end with nowhere to flee, and in an instant he died on the spot.

Which cultivation star did this fellow come from? Why had they never heard of him before? To wield such strength and cultivate such an odd Shi—he could not be a mere nobody; he must be a rising star of some great power.

Yet they had never heard of such a youth in the Star Domain.

Though relieved, they also grew uneasy; after all, the two of them now had no strength to fight back and did not know Yang Kai's nature. If Yang Kai gained the final victory and chose to slaughter them, they would scarcely be able to resist.

For a time, the two women from Ice Heart Valley were overwhelmed with sorrow—being at the mercy of others was unbearable. Yet they dared not act, fearing to draw Yang Kai's attention.

Elsewhere, the Demon Blood Sect's leader was equally horrified. She had witnessed Jin Shi's gruesome death and her heart was thrown into chaos. She had never expected Yang Kai's combat power to be so spectacular; even her sect's elder could not hold out long before him. Hadn't he only recently advanced to the Origin Returning Realm? How could he possess such a potent Shi?

Could it be that Jin Shi's intelligence was wrong—has this fellow been playing the fool while hiding his strength?

In an instant the Demon Blood Sect's leader cursed the deceased Jin Shi in her heart, secretly regretting provoking such a freak. Entangled by the jade-green giant dragon, she had no temper left and no extra strength to deal with Yang Kai.

The jade-green giant dragon had been forged from the bones of an Ancient Divine Spirit and fused with a strand of dragon soul and a Dragon Pearl; it was full of spirit. Though it could not, like a Fire Bird artifact spirit, independently judge the course of battle—its intelligence was incomplete and it lacked a sense of when to advance or retreat—its power was indisputable.

Coupled with Yang Kai's Divine Sense control, it was fully capable of fighting the Demon Blood Sect's leader one-on-one.

The Demon Blood Sect's leader wailed; her seductive techniques had no effect on the jade-green giant dragon. The bracelet-shaped secret treasure, enswathed in that green mist, had its spirit greatly weakened. The green mist contained deadly poison and was corrosive; though the bracelet's grade was not low, it could not stop the toxin's spread.

She did not even dare release her Demon Blood Threads for fear they would be tainted by the green dragon; she also had to divide her Saint Yuan and spirit to resist the terrifying cold here—the situation had become dire.

At the moment of Jin Shi's gruesome death, she began to entertain thoughts of retreat.

But Yang Kai did not give her that chance. With a flash he arrived nearby with Biluo, using his mind to control the Dragon Bone sword to entangle her while his own Shi rolled to envelop her.

The Demon Blood Sect's leader looked horrified, barely avoiding a puff of poisonous mist; she forced a strained smile and cooed, "Young brother, leave a way out—so we may meet again in the future. Why be so heartless? Besides, this humble woman never meant to do anything to you."

Sensing danger, she even altered how she addressed herself, no longer using her lofty title before Yang Kai but adopting a humbler form of address.

"I have no need to leave a way out," Yang Kai sneered coldly. "Because we will never meet again."

The Demon Blood Sect's leader's expression flickered; her lovely eyes filled with resentment and terror as she forced a smile and pleaded, "No, Young Brother, spare me! If you let me go, I'll obey you in everything. Whatever you ask, I'll do it. I'll serve you comfortably, alright? After all, I'm a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; I can be of considerable use to you."

As she spoke, her seductive eyes and those ruby, moist lips were truly tempting.

“Wench!” Biluo spat through gritted teeth, her face full of contempt.

"Sorry, I'm not interested in you," Yang Kai said with a solemn shake of his head. "You can go and die!"

As he spoke, countless spatial rifts again manifested around the Demon Blood Sect's leader and, under Yang Kai's command, gathered toward her.

"If you want me dead, you won't have an easy time either!" the Demon Blood Sect's leader abandoned her earlier pretence and howled hysterically; her pretty face twisted horribly. Two blood-red Demon Blood Threads leisurely shot forth; she formed hand seals and coquettishly cried, "Explode!"

A startling energy ripple rolled out from those Demon Blood Threads, and two blood-red lights blossomed like the most gorgeous flowers, unfurling their final beauty.

But that beauty concealed boundless killing intent.

Yang Kai's face changed; without thinking he immediately summoned the Purple Shield and invoked its sandstorm might to guard around himself and Biluo.

Boom... two tremendous explosions reached them, shaking the entire Ice Path.

The violent aftershocks swept everywhere, instantly shredding Yang Kai's Shi; even the jade-green giant dragon that had lunged at the Demon Blood Sect's leader was blown away by that terrifying wave.

The two Demon Blood Threads had been refined by her for years, absorbing unimaginable qi and blood essence; when they self-destructed, their force was naturally incomparable.

Within a radius of a hundred zhang, it was utter chaos.

But the Demon Blood Sect's leader was nowhere to be found—she had clearly used the confusion to flee.

A golden light flashed in Yang Kai's left eye; through the layers of mist he scanned the area and soon spotted the Demon Blood Sect's leader. Her speed was not slow—within a blink she was already a hundred zhang away, desperately charging beyond the Ice Path.

Yang Kai's mouth twitched; he did not pursue. Instead he stood there with a gleeful smirk, quietly waiting as if for a good show to begin.

Sensing this, the Demon Blood Sect's leader rejoiced inwardly. She believed Yang Kai had been hurt in that explosion and could not give chase, secretly glad she had been decisive—otherwise she would surely have died.

Before that thought finished, a grayish figure suddenly appeared in her sight. It was small—about one chi high—and looked odd, like a stone carving.

What made her suspicious was how lifelike the stone carving seemed; its two eyes were remarkably spirited. Stranger still, the carving hoisted a jet-black staff and squatted on a small ice mound motionless.

"What is that?" the Demon Blood Sect's leader asked, full of doubt, and could not help staring twice.

At that moment the stone carving actually stood up from the ice mound; its clear eyes fixed on her, and it raised the black staff and, as if lightly, swung it at her.

The action seemed ridiculous—she felt no threat from it.

But in the next moment her expression twisted wildly.

The black staff, originally only as tall as the stone carving, oddly lengthened the instant it was swung, becoming like a mountain pressing down and crashing straight onto her head.

A horror she had never felt before rose from her heart, and for a moment the Demon Blood Sect's leader found it hard to breathe.

It seemed that under that blow even heaven and earth would change color.

She had weathered countless storms in her life and fought many battles; her combat experience was considerable. At this moment she knew the stone carving had clearly been arranged by the enemy as a contingency.

She recalled Jin Shi's report about the battle at Dragon Lair Mountain mentioning a stone giant!

Could it be...

The Demon Blood Sect's leader dared not think further. She bit her tongue and spat a cloud of blood mist; the mist moved like it had a will, writhing and changing before her, then shrouded her. In an instant a blood-red treasure armor appeared over her full, delicate body, seeming to offer decent defense.

That was not all—she then manifested a mirror-like secret treasure, which became an invisible barrier above her.

No sooner had she finished than the black staff fell.

With a crash the invisible barrier tore like paper upon contact with the staff, shattered, and was blasted aside; the mirror surface broke and its spirit light dimmed.

The Demon Blood Sect's leader went deathly pale; before she could act further, the staff had already landed on her head.

Her vision went black; the Demon Blood Sect's leader knew nothing more.

Even as a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm powerhouse, struck squarely by the Stone Puppet's Heaven-Shaking Pillar, there was absolutely no chance of survival.

Her skull exploded open; her body, under that terrifying force, fell like a meteor and smashed onto the hard ice, spraying a vivid blossom of blood.

Seeing this scene, Yang Kai's mouth twitched and a satisfied smile creased his face.

The Stone Puppet had of course been sent out by him beforehand. Though the freezing cold here was terrifying, it didn't affect the puppet at all. Yang Kai's intent had only been to let the Stone Puppet seize an opportunity to launch a surprise attack and see if one decisive blow could settle matters—he had not expected such an unintended result.

He was, of course, more than satisfied; had the Stone Puppet not been lying in wait to unexpectedly strike the Demon Blood Sect's leader, it would have been rather difficult to kill her.
