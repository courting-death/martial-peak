## Chapter 537 — What Exactly Do You Want to Do?

“To me, they are no different from common dogs and cats,” Yang Kai said with a cold sneer as he turned to look at the one who had spoken.

“Arrogant!” That man snorted coldly, and the others gradually shook their heads, disappointment showing clearly on their faces.

They had been in Zhongdu all along, but every day they monitored the situation at War City. From Yang Kai’s past behavior, they had all regarded him as a reliable candidate to inherit the position of Family Head.

But now that they had met him, they suddenly realized this was a reckless youth with no regard for anyone! Naturally, they felt disappointed.

Although the Yang Family was arrogant and overbearing, they would not dare to provoke the wrath of the masses. Yang Kai’s killing of the heirs from two first-rate great families in this Succession War was undoubtedly crossing a forbidden line!

Because of this, in the future, who among the great families would dare to send participants to the Succession War if the Yang Family still presided over it? It was precisely because the sons and daughters of these great families faced no risk to their lives when joining, while also gaining experience and potential investment returns, that countless forces eagerly crowded into every succession battle.

Now, with Yang Kai’s actions, if no explanation were given to the world, no one would dare to attend any more. How then could the Succession War continue to exist?

“Relying on the status of a direct disciple of the Yang Family to decide over the life and death of heirs from other great families—your actions have caused great pain and embarrassment to the family,” a middle-aged woman in her forties glared coldly at Yang Kai with a hoarse voice.

She was not unattractive; though past her prime, she still carried a certain charm. But that voice—there was something about it that made people feel particularly uncomfortable.

“Even if I were not a direct disciple of the Yang Family, those two brought it upon themselves and had to die!” A cold glint flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes.

Several elders shook their heads repeatedly. The woman said, “It seems there’s no reasoning with you. Elder Zhen, you say something.”

Yang Zhen nodded slightly, taking over the words. “Yang Kai, you have gone too far this time. You are young and impulsive; I understand. I, too, once had such a period in my life, so I won't blame you. But as a man, you must take responsibility for what you have done.”

“And what responsibility do you want me to take?” Yang Kai smiled. “Do the two families want me to give my life?”

Yang Zhen nodded faintly. “The Nan Family and Xiang Family arrived in Zhongdu a few days ago and entered the Yang Family. They do intend exactly that.”

“And what does the family say?” Yang Kai smirked with a look of amusement.

“The family naturally would never accept such an insulting request,” Yang Zhen snorted coldly. “They don’t even weigh their own importance. Demanding the life of a Yang Family disciple is utterly laughable.”

Yang Kai’s expression was unchanged. That the family rejected their demands was not to save him but concerned the honor of the family—this he well understood.

If someone else from the Yang Family had done such a thing, the family would have protected them just the same.

Therefore, Yang Kai had no intention to feel grateful.

“But this matter must be resolved, or the Yang Family will lose face outside.” Yang Zhen’s voice turned grave. “The family commands you to formally apologize and offer compensation to those two families!”

“Formally apologize and offer compensation?” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

“Correct!”

“And if I refuse?”

“It is the family’s order!” The man in the blue robe said sternly. “Do you dare to refuse?”

“What of it if it is the family’s order?” Yang Kai glanced at him with a sidelong look.

“You rebel!” The man sneered fiercely. “I have long heard that you are unruly, but you are even more so than the rumors. We came here especially for you and have already shown much face. Do not play with fire and bring disaster upon yourself.”

As he spoke, a sudden force burst forth. Countless Divine Senses and formidable pressure poured in from all directions, enveloping the entire side hall.

Rumble...

The side hall trembled violently, dust and debris shaking loose from the roof.

Against these Divine Senses and pressure, the aura that the man in blue radiated shattered like spring snow under the blazing sun.

Several elders’ complexions changed drastically; it seemed they suddenly recalled that many powerful cultivators lived within Yang Kai’s mansion. To demonstrate force here felt like showing off before a master craftsman…

“Everyone, step back!” Yang Kai barked angrily.

The terrifying pressure instantly dissipated, and all the Divine Senses withdrew.

The man in blue perspired, his expression complex as he stared at Yang Kai.

He was an elder of the Yang Family, wielding great power, second only to the Family Head. He had thought delivering the family’s orders at Yang Kai’s mansion would be an easy task, but now it seemed extremely dangerous.

The reputation this youth held among the strong within his mansion was unprecedented.

No wonder the Family Head had dispatched several elders together. Initially, he thought it an overreaction, but now he realized the Family Head’s foresight.

Had he come alone, Yang Kai might not even have spared him the courtesy of a reply.

“What is this elder’s name?” Yang Kai asked, staring at him.

“Wei Qing!” The elder replied unconsciously, but when he realized he had done so, his face reddened.

The other elders rolled their eyes, mentally downgrading their opinion of Wei Qing severely.

“Elder Wei...” A trace of disdain flashed in Yang Kai's eyes as he said coldly, “Please do not display your subtle strength within my mansion. The people here are dangerous, as you surely know.”

Wei Qing’s expressions flickered continually, increasingly remarkable.

“That’s enough!” Yang Zhen shouted angrily, glaring coldly at Yang Kai. “Though Elder Wei Qing was not born into our Yang Family, he has contributed greatly in recent years, or he would never hold his place. You have no right to slander or belittle him. Insulting him is insulting the Elder Hall itself. Are you prepared to bear that responsibility?”

Yang Kai fell silent, his expression indifferent.

“Let’s get to the point,” the woman hurriedly urged. Originally, everyone had planned how to pressure Yang Kai. Some would play the ‘red face,’ others the ‘black face.’ The elders all appearing together would surely bring the desired effect, right?

But unexpectedly, in just a few words, Yang Kai had diverted the conversation, making it unlikely they could end things smoothly.

This youth truly knew how to lead others by the nose. The woman glanced at Yang Kai with growing interest, but his attitude was infuriating. No wonder Wei Qing could not contain himself.

How could a disciple of the Yang Family so blatantly defy family orders and openly defy the elders? Was this even a proper Yang Family disciple?

“Yes, let’s stick to the matter,” Yang Zhen said, startled and immediately alert. “Putting aside the Nan and Xiang families for now, Yang Kai, I ask you: does your household harbor a highly powerful evil magician?”

“Yes.”

“From the Cangyun Evil Land?”

“No, I have explained this clearly to the Great Elder of Fengshen Hall.”

Yang Zhen nodded. “That I know. We once sent people to investigate Cangyun Evil Land. Officially, he is not from there, but information can be fabricated. You say he’s not from there; where else could he be from?”

“I do not know,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Wei Qing fell silent, but a man in yellow sneered, “You don’t even know, yet still allowed him in? I heard you and him are master and servant.”

“I’m not one to pry into secrets. Everyone has their own. Do you elder have none? If I now asked, would you be willing to share all your affairs with me?”

“Outrageous!” The man grew enraged, slapping his chair.

Yang Zhen squeezed his fingers gently, realizing that in verbal disputes, none of these elders could match Yang Kai. With just a few words, this youth could destabilize even these haughty Yang Family elders.

“Putting that aside for now, Yang Kai, you indeed come from Lingxiao Pavilion, correct?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai frowned slightly, beginning to sense what Yang Zhen intended.

“The remnants of Lingxiao Pavilion... cough... those people are now gathered in your mansion?”

“Yes.”

“Lingxiao Pavilion is an Evil Sect. Your residence gathers many from the Evil Sect, including some from Ghost King Valley. Though I will not discuss those for now, I ask you this... Have you ever cultivated any evil arts?” Yang Zhen’s gaze sharpened, his demeanor menacingly pressing toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai lifted a corner of his mouth, amused. “If I say I have not practiced evil arts, would you elders believe me?”

They all slowly shook their heads.

Less than ten days ago, Yang Kai had ascended to the Divine Roaming Realm. The evil energy that burst from his body spread throughout War City, causing widespread fear and mental disturbance.

Everyone believed Yang Kai had cultivated evil arts. Even if he now vehemently denied it, nothing would change.

“In that case, I shall not answer.”

They had already concluded he practiced evil arts. More words would be futile—their words would be wasted.

“Then I’ll take silence as consent...” Yang Zhen took a deep breath, his face darkening. “Yang Kai, to be honest, at first, I did not favor you in this Succession War. Your displayed strength and aid were too weak. But repeatedly, you created miracles that inspired us all. I have come to believe you are the right next head of the Yang Family. The Yang Family is vast but bloated; only under outstanding leadership can it progress further—and you are such a person.”

“Elder, you flatter me,” Yang Kai said, slightly moved.

“But now, I must ask...” Yang Zhen inhaled deeply and shouted, “Yang Kai, what exactly do you intend to do?”

Yang Kai looked at him calmly, silent.

Yang Zhen stood up and took steps toward Yang Kai. Slowly, he enumerated, “You harbor disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, have close ties with people from Ghost King Valley, keep by your side a mysterious evil magician servant, yourself cultivate evil arts that nearly led to a demonic deviation, yet remain stubborn. Just a few days ago, you ascended, and now you have reached the second layer of Divine Roaming Realm. Your rapid cultivation of evil arts... is truly extraordinary.”

“Yang Kai, tell me, what do you intend? Do you plan to overturn this Zhongdu and rebel against the Eight Great Families?” Yang Zhen approached step by step, his eyes piercing like a hawk, capturing every shred of Yang Kai’s soul.
