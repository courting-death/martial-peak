## Chapter 349 — Entering Demonic State

When the Sisters from the Hu Family hurried over, their expressions were filled with panic. They were met with a scene of destruction, the remnants of a fierce battle lay scattered about, and on the ground, the bodies of the green-robed and yellow-robed elders were sprawled out.

With anxious eyes darting about, their gaze quickly fell upon Yang Kai, who was standing not far away.

He seemed to be holding onto a chain, standing still and emanating an icy and terrifying energy fluctuation.

Swish, swish, swish...

The people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect arrived one after another, their expressions shifting upon noticing the oddity surrounding Yang Kai, uncertainty clouding their thoughts regarding what had transpired.

However, the current situation was much better than they had feared; at the very least, Yang Kai showed no obvious injuries and radiated a life aura, indicating he was not dead.

Recognizing this, everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

Yang Kai sensed their presence but remained lost in thought, replaying the last words of the Demonic Spirit before its demise.

Just a single phrase, yet it concealed so much information.

Demon General Meng Ge! This was the designation the Demonic Spirit used for him. From this title, it was easy to surmise that he was not just a new Demonic Spirit but rather someone of significant status; otherwise, he wouldn’t bear such a name or identity.

Additionally, it seemed that the Demonic Spirit was merely a strand of his divine consciousness.

The four great masters, Chimei, Mei, Wang, and Liang, had joined forces to battle him, yet within the duration of a single incense stick, two were killed while two others fled with severe injuries. He, on the other hand, had only been pinned to the ground by a spear-type treasure, which he later pulled out as if nothing had happened.

A mere strand of divine consciousness wielded such power. If he were to come in person, how terrifying would he be?

Yang Kai’s heart raced at the thought of this individual’s true strength, which likely exceeded anything he had ever encountered or understood! 

Fortunately, he was a true demon; the Locking Demon Chain only responded to true demons. If it weren’t for that, Yang Kai might not have been able to deal with him even decades later.

After uttering that last sentence, the Demon General Meng Ge seemingly realized his time was limited and dissipated his body without a moment of hesitation.

He left only a great mass of icy and surging essence.

This essence was precisely the treasure contained within the Evil Spirit Spring Source.

At this moment, it had been absorbed into Yang Kai’s meridians.

The Locking Demon Chain, meanwhile, seemed to have lost its spirit during this battle, dull and lifeless, no different from waste. However, Yang Kai could still perceive a hint of vitality hidden within it. As long as it was nourished properly, it would certainly recover in time.

After all, this was a treasure left by the ancestors of Lingxiao Pavilion. Though it had been a long time, it wouldn't be easily damaged.

With a deep sigh, Yang Kai felt an endless surge of ambition rise within him. Having witnessed the prowess of Demon General Meng Ge’s Divine Sense today rekindled his heart's pursuit of the pinnacle of Martial Arts.

Clenching his teeth, Yang Kai’s expression turned weighty and his gaze resolute.

“Yang Kai...” Not hearing him speak for a long time, the Sisters from the Hu Family gently called out.

“I’m fine.” Yang Kai took a deep breath, retracting the Locking Demon Chain back into his body. He turned to the others and said, “I need to find a place to seclude myself.”

“I know a suitable location. It’s not far from here!” Cheng Ying quickly responded.

“Take me there.”

...

Within a cave in Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, alone, beginning to refine the energy contained within that mass of essence.

This place had been discovered by Cheng Ying by chance, and it was indeed extremely secluded. Additionally, after this recent upheaval in Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, there were no evil spirits appearing anymore.

The people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect understood that Yang Kai surely gained something again and did not rush to leave. Instead, they stayed behind to guard the cave above, resting and recuperating.

Taking advantage of this spare time, everyone orderly began to refine the essence of the evil spirits they had obtained.

Both Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect had each yielded two Purifying Spirit Flasks of essence, totaling forty! Divided among them, it amounted to a considerable number.

The Sisters from the Hu Family were more fortunate; they each had five flasks.

With kind hearts, the two sisters originally intended to give one Purifying Spirit Flask each to Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect, but their offerings were politely declined.

Everyone was satisfied with this haul, so why would they still covet the Sisters from the Hu Family’s spoils? Those were treasures gifted by Yang Kai to them.

Left with no choice, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er ceased the pretense. As they operated the Consonant Spirit Technique, their refining speed for the evil spirit essence was several times faster than others. Though they could not be compared to Yang Kai, they were certainly not average cultivators.

While the people above were refining the evil spirit essence, Yang Kai was engaged in a similar process.

However, the essence he was refining was somewhat different from that of others.

Even the essence left behind by the Soul Evil Spirit could not be compared to this mass.

During the process of refining, rhythmic pulsations emanated from the Indomitable Golden Body, resonating with the energy within the essence.

The True Yang Yuan Qi retreated completely into the Dantian, and Yang Kai’s entire being was engulfed by black aura, resembling the state he had observed in Demon General Meng Ge earlier.

However, the two appearances still bore some differences. Meng Ge could obviously control his power, retracting his demonic energy, while Yang Kai could not. He was enveloped in darkness, appearing as a mass of black, with only his eyes shining brightly when opened.

A chill and demonic aura spread outward, causing cracking sounds to echo throughout the cave. The cave walls soon frosted over, crystallizing into ice shards and forming black ice.

The guardians outside quickly sensed something amiss, as this sinister chill surged through the earth toward them, rapidly approaching.

With a startled cry, they swiftly retreated over a hundred zhang, only to nervously glance back. They witnessed that the entire world surrounding the cave had been enshrouded by a layer of ice, with moisture in the air crystallizing into frost, piling up in layers and spreading outwards.

It seemed that before time itself, there was nothing but frozen earth there.

Even at this distance, those with slightly weaker abilities shivered noticeably, recalling the chilling presence that penetrated to the depths of their souls, filling them with terror.

“What’s happening?” Shen Yi asked in confusion, “Why do I feel that this chill resembles that which emanated from the Evil Spirit Spring Source?"

Earlier, when they steadfastly held the high platform, they had also felt such coldness, but it was far from this clarity and horror.

“Yang Kai won’t be in trouble, will he?” Hu Mei’er gently queried her sister.

Hu Jiao’er calmly shook her head, “This should be the commotion he created. As long as the commotion continues, he won’t run into trouble.”

Yet even she was not entirely sure, but could only comfort her sister with these words.

Leng Shan nodded in agreement, “Good people don’t live long, but disasters last for thousands of years. I also believe he won’t have any issues.”

“Tsk, tsk.” Shen Yi smacked his lips, glancing at her teasingly, “Junior Sister, why do I feel like your words are dripping with vinegar?”

“Will you die if you don’t speak?” Leng Shan glared at him.

“Hey, hey...” Shen Yi immediately chuckled awkwardly.

In the depths of the cave, Yang Kai’s expression was calm, entirely unaffected by the chilling aura. This coldness seemed to perfectly suit his current state, offering no discomfort and, in fact, filling him with pleasure.

In the past, when he utilized the energy of the Indomitable Golden Body, he exuded an evil aura, but now, he was both sinister and cold. The two aspects complemented each other, amplifying each other's power.

As day turned to night outside, time passed unknowingly within the cave.

When the last strand of essence energy was refined, it seemed to transform into a key, unlocking the secrets of the Indomitable Golden Body, sealed for many years.

At that moment, the restraints of the Indomitable Golden Body completely unraveled.

Rampant evil energy surged forth, enveloping the entire cave in darkness, the demonic energy roiling like a tumultuous dragon, the sounds of its howling echoing endlessly.

Yang Kai abruptly opened his eyes, the crimson hue within them receding swiftly, revealing clarity of black and white.

Simultaneously, the myriad mysteries and wonders within his Golden Body were comprehensively perceived by Yang Kai.

Enveloped by the demonic energy, Yang Kai’s eyes sparkled with brilliance.

Squinting slightly, Yang Kai extended a finger and slowly tapped his forehead, a dreamlike whisper resounding softly.

“Enter Demonic State!”

In an instant, his body transformed into a bottomless pit, ravenously drawing in the black demonic energy from the outside.

All of this demonic energy arranged itself in a highly methodical manner, visible strands of energy coating Yang Kai's body.

In just a breath's time, all the black demonic energy vanished, replaced by numerous dark lines spreading across Yang Kai’s body.

These lines densely covered his skin, taking on an inexplicable and mysterious pattern, occupying over ninety percent of Yang Kai's skin, with only his face remaining untouched.

Slowly rising, Yang Kai's expression was composed, neither happy nor sorrowful, his eyes cold like ice.

But he could distinctly feel that his current state was vastly different from before.

He was no longer shrouded in black aura to the point of obscuring his face; rather, now, if he did not remove his clothes, he appeared much like he did ordinarily.

However, the combat power he could exert was many times stronger than before.

The realm remained the same, no progress made whatsoever; that massive evil spirit essence seemed to merely serve as the key to unlocking the Indomitable Golden Body.

As Yang Kai stood, the entire world seemed to quiver, a low hum reverberated endlessly, imbuing a sense that the world was about to collapse.

Moreover, that unparalleled demonic presence radiated outward. The guardians outside, over a hundred zhang away, felt this clearly as their eyes quivered violently, filled with terror.

Gently clenching his fist, a crisp sound resonated.

This fist seemed to contain world-destroying power.

Never before had he felt such confidence, as if he could shatter even a Divine Roaming Realm expert standing before him.

With a casual flick, a ribbon of black demonic energy shot out like a serpent emerging from the cave, directly penetrating the frozen cave wall before Yang Kai’s Divine Sense. It pushed out over dozens of zhang before slowly vanishing.

The power was impressive; Yang Kai grinned, somewhat ferocious.

In addition to this, Yang Kai felt that the blood vitality hidden within his body was in an unprecedented vigor! It was at least four to five times more robust than usual.

With such vigorous blood vitality, the most notable characteristic was its formidable healing power. Strength and speed were closely tied to the strength of one’s blood vitality.

After entering the demonic state, all the blood vitality within his body seemed to be stimulated and magnified!
