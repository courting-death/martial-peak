## Chapter 2099 — Supreme Treasure Reveals Its Might

When that enormous single black eye surged into Yang Kai's body and fused with him, Yang Kai's mind grew muddled.

All the negative emotions that had long been hidden deep within his heart seemed, as if pulled by some force, to erupt at once, causing his whole body to radiate an utterly malevolent aura.

Intricate, arcane Demon Marks crawled across his skin; with a great influx of Demonic Qi, those marks grew ever darker.

A power far exceeding the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm fermented inside him, assaulting his heart and sense of self. He lost himself in the intoxicating joy of sudden strength; a thick killing intent and an overwhelming urge for destruction rose in his chest, particularly aimed at flesh-and-blood beings.

His Divine Sense sank, wrapped by boundless darkness, with no light to be seen; with the passage of time he would have become a demon.

Yet at that moment, in the endless darkness, a faint light tore through the gloom like a keen blade and quietly blossomed forth.

The light displayed seven colors, resplendent and wondrous; seven-hued radiance pierced the boundless Demonic Qi and shone upon Yang Kai, bathing him in warmth, as if, after a freezing winter night, one finally welcomed the sun.

The malevolent aura on his body seemed to meet its nemesis and dissolved into wisps of blue smoke that quickly vanished.

Yang Kai's consciousness, which was on the verge of sinking, suddenly cleared for an instant.

He clenched his jaw and forced his vision to its limit, peering hard into the distance.

Within his sight, a phantom of a lotus radiating seven-colored light flickered in and out of view.

The seven-colored lotus was hardly large. Beside the boundless Demonic Qi it seemed worlds apart, yet the place where it bloomed had become the last patch of purity in that dark world.

"Warm Spirit Lotus!" Clarity suddenly returned to Yang Kai's mind; he realized he had, without knowing it, manifested a Spirit Body and entered his own Sea of Consciousness.

That seven-colored radiance was clearly the light emitted by the Warm Spirit Lotus.

He moved his will and immediately rushed toward the place where the Warm Spirit Lotus resided.

In a short while he was standing at the lotus's heart.

The seven-colored light enveloped him and drove away all his negative emotions. When the black smoke flew out from his body, Yang Kai finally regained full clarity.

As he gazed out, the entire Sea of Consciousness was swallowed by boundless darkness; even the Star Chart that should have hung above it gave off no glimmer. In that whole realm, save for the radiance streaming from the seven-colored Warm Spirit Lotus, there seemed to be nothing else.

A gigantic single black eye spanned the sky over the Sea of Consciousness, coldly looking down at Yang Kai with no hint of feeling.

Yang Kai could not see it with ordinary sight, but this was his Sea of Consciousness—he could sense it clearly.

From that single black eye emanated boundless oppression and will, seeking to destroy Yang Kai's soul defenses and defile his soul.

Yet under the protection of such a heavenly treasure as the Warm Spirit Lotus, any invisible assault could be purified by its radiance.

Moreover, from the Warm Spirit Lotus many tiny insects, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, suddenly flew forth.

Soul Devouring Worms!

These strange insects Yang Kai had obtained years ago on the Tongxuan Continent had long since lost their usefulness as his strength grew. He had placed them on the Seven-Colored Treasure Isle manifested by the Warm Spirit Lotus and left them to their own fate.

Years of nourishment had increased their numbers to an unimaginable scale.

Now, to Yang Kai's surprise, they all flew out of the Warm Spirit Lotus and scattered in every direction.

Where they passed came a crisp chittering, clear and pleasant; the ancient Demonic Qi that had invaded Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness was devoured at a visibly rapid rate.

Could the Soul Devouring Worms actually consume Demonic Qi? Yang Kai was greatly astonished.

As time went on, those worms that had swallowed Demonic Qi grew ever larger; they had originally been nearly undetectable, and even when Yang Kai had once released them against foes, the enemies could not see them.

Yet now, within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, their sizes increased at a speed visible to the naked eye; their exteriors gradually turned jet black, and complex, subtle Demon Marks wound about their bodies, each one giving off a most uncanny aura.

Before long, one by one the Soul Devouring Worms grew to the size of grains of rice, and continued to expand at an even faster pace.

Within the Sea of Consciousness the Demonic Qi churned restlessly; as if possessing thought, it began to flee the worms' devouring—yet this was Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness; where could it hide?

Those clumps of Demonic Qi were like leaves being eaten by spring silkworms, soon revealing large gaping holes.

Yang Kai watched in silence for a while, unsure whether it was blessing or disaster, but since it favored him he did not concern himself.

The next moment he moved his mind and drove the Warm Spirit Lotus upward to a spot high in the sky, coming face to face with that enormous black pupil hidden in the endless darkness.

The Demonic Qi slowly dispersed, finally revealing the outline of the black pupil.

Even within Yang Kai’s own Sea of Consciousness, it still spanned half the sky. Standing before it, he was as small and insignificant as an ant.

Seven-colored radiance flickered in and out, forming a halo around Yang Kai’s body. Like the turning of celestial bodies, a vast aureole swept outward in an instant.

"Get out, or... be utterly destroyed!" Yang Kai willed it, and a thunderous sound descended from the sky—a roar like an invisible blade piercing the black pupil and twisting its form.

After a long moment the black pupil settled again; that deep darkness, like a black hole, still stood motionless.

"So it truly has no mind of its own, only a lingering will?" Yang Kai pondered; though he had suspected it, he had not dared be certain before.

Now, after this probing, he finally obtained the answer he wanted—the single black eye no longer possessed its own consciousness, only the lingering will of an Ancient Giant Demon remained.

After all, in that distant ancient age countless Emperor Realm masters had destroyed and erased it; its own thinking had long since dissipated.

If that was the case, then there was fundamentally no way to communicate with it.

Yang Kai's expression grew solemn as he unleashed the Warm Spirit Lotus's power.

The next moment the seven-colored radiance burst forth brilliantly, forming blade after blade that stabbed toward the single black eye.

In that instant, the single black eye actually fixed Yang Kai with a long look, then slowly closed.

Across Heaven and Earth a titanic voice thundered, “You bear the aura of demons! I entrust it to you—take it all, go witness the end of this world, go and behold the annihilation of Heaven and Earth!”

An unparalleled ferocity leisurely spread out; the closed single black eye suddenly became a streak of black light that shot toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was thunderstruck and hurried to guard his mind against it; at the same time the Warm Spirit Lotus spun round and round, its endless seven-colored radiance forming a barrier that tried to block the black light's invasion.

Yet everything proved futile.

That black light easily pierced the Warm Spirit Lotus's barrier, tore through Yang Kai's defenses, and struck directly into his body.

The next instant Yang Kai felt his soul torn by wrenching, heart-rending pain; his entire Spirit Body could not hold and disintegrated.

Immediately his consciousness returned to his physical form and he roared, a cry like a wounded beast howling through the mountains.

Wrapped in surging Demonic Qi, Yang Kai's appearance was obscured; he clutched his right eye tightly, and golden blood continuously flowed from that right eye.

Ten li away, Hua Qingsi and the man surnamed Fu were both dumbstruck.

They had seen everything from start to finish since Yang Kai's mutation began, so they vaguely understood what had occurred.

Before their very eyes, the pitch-black Demonic Qi that had spanned tens of thousands of li surged into Yang Kai's body and vanished within the time it took a single stick of incense to burn.

Countless demonic creatures all knelt to the ground, yet for reasons unknown the Demonic Qi in them had also vanished completely.

Deprived of the Demonic Qi that had sustained them, those once-ferocious fiends suddenly became terribly weak; though their lives were not immediately in danger, their vital energies were badly wounded. One by one they stared about in stunned confusion, utterly unaware of what had happened, while the demonic beasts panicked and fled in chaotic disorder.

Sunlight returned to the land, bringing warmth.

But the man surnamed Fu and Hua Qingsi felt a chill in their hearts.

For from Yang Kai ten li away they had sensed an oppressive aura comparable to an Emperor Realm expert, yet that pressure was evil to the extreme, seemingly tinged with the scent of blood and instinctively repelling the aura of the living.

The next moment, the trembling Yang Kai suddenly calmed.

The large hand still pressed against his right eye slowly loosened; he extended both hands and held them before his face as if scrutinizing something.

From the darkness shot two mysterious lights.

One was golden, the other black.

A golden, awe-inspiring left eye with a vertical slit and a black, chaos-filled right eye with a horizontal pupil trembled violently where Yang Kai's own eyes should be, their contrast brutally vivid.

"What is this?" the man surnamed Fu nearly gaped, stunned; even born of Fei Sheng Palace, he could not fathom what sort of monstrous eyes he was beholding.

As soon as his words fell, those two utterly different gazes suddenly turned toward the direction where he and Hua Qingsi were.

"Bad!" Hua Qingsi cried out; the instant her sight met those two eyes she felt her head grow heavy, her delicate face changed, and she shouted, "Run!"

As she spoke she formed a hand seal; with a single motion she transformed into over a hundred multicolored butterflies that fled in all directions.

Seeing her act so decisively, the man surnamed Fu realized this was no mere performance; hastily he bit his tongue and spat a mouthful of blood, wrapped himself in a layer of red light, and retreated at speed, covering dozens of li in the blink of an eye.
