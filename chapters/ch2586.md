## Chapter 2586 — One Eye Open, One Eye Shut

Before the Saint Envoy could investigate, the space over there suddenly twisted, and a tall figure appeared out of thin air.

The Saint Envoy was utterly shocked. He and the other seven had sealed off a ten-li radius—no one, not even a mosquito, should have been able to get in. Fifty li further out, thirty-two Yao Kings guarded the perimeter, layer upon layer. How could someone have slipped through?

And judging by the aura, it was actually a human!

How could this be?

The Saint Envoy, both startled and furious, shouted, "Who are you, little thief? How dare you trespass in a forbidden land! Prepare to die!"

The Saint Envoy's words had barely left his lips when his form erupted into a streak of rainbow light, dense Yao Qi churning around him as he lunged at Yang Kai. Mid-flight, he thrust out a palm strike—a full-powered blow from a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, radiating fury and overwhelming force.

Yang Kai stood his ground, feeling his bones crack and pop. For the first time, he truly experienced the terrifying strength of a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert.

He wasn't flustered, only watching coldly as the yao charged at him. When the moment was right, he suddenly waved his hand.

Swish, swish, swish...

Like divine soldiers descending from the heavens, the Stone Spirit Race made a dramatic entrance, led by the Stone Spirit Elder.

But there was no sign of the Wood Spirit Race. The hundred or so Wood Spirits had vanished somewhere, leaving Yang Kai puzzled.

"Roar..."

The furious roar shook the heavens. Xiaoxiao leapt forward, his small body suddenly growing larger amid a thunderous crackling, transforming into a three-zhang-tall Stone Giant. His stone armor was thick and solid, seemingly able to withstand world-shattering attacks.

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar on his shoulder also grew longer and thicker. Facing the incoming yao Saint Envoy, he swung it in a sweeping strike.

Wind and thunder erupted. The force of this strike stirred the very heavens and earth.

The charging yao Saint Envoy was thrown into chaos. Seeing Yang Kai alone, he had attacked without hesitation, wanting to kill him and eliminate future trouble. Who could have guessed that in the blink of an eye, so many stone men would appear?

He had no time to react—Xiaoxiao's club was already smashing down.

The yao Saint Envoy was formidable, hastily halting his charge. Yao Yuan surged forth, forming a protective layer around him. He crossed his arms over his chest.

Boom...

The Heaven-Shaking Pillar struck, and the yao Saint Envoy felt an unimaginable force crash into him. His Yao Yuan shattered, his arm bones cracked, and he was sent flying uncontrollably.

Midair, he spat blood, flying several hundred zhang before barely stabilizing himself.

The Stone Spirit Race's terrifying strength was just that overwhelming. Even a yao Saint Envoy comparable to the Third Stage Emperor Realm would suffer greatly from a direct hit.

"Stone... Spirit!" The yao Saint Envoy's eyes turned red. Though he suffered a setback, it was only a minor injury, nothing serious. Instead, it fueled his murderous intent.

Swish, swish, swish...

Figures who heard the commotion flew in from all directions, standing beside the yao Saint Envoy. Including him, there were eight in total.

They were the Eight Envoys serving the Four Great Saint Venerables.

These eight yao experts all knew the Stone Spirit Race. When the Four Great Saint Venerables tried to subdue the Stone Spirits, it was these envoys who relayed messages, meeting each other more than once.

One burly Saint Envoy squinted at the front and snorted, "Elder, what are you planning?"

The Stone Spirit Race stood near the Blood Gate, the Elder at the front, leaning on his staff. He rumbled, "Our tribe's future lies here. What do you think this old man intends?"

The Saint Envoy's gaze chilled. He said, "Elder, don't bring disaster upon yourself. If you anger the Four Saint Venerables, you know the consequences. The Stone Spirit Race is few in number—you wouldn't want your race wiped out, would you?"

The Stone Spirit Elder chuckled softly, stroking his stone beard. "My tribe's people are born from the will of heaven and earth itself. To exterminate us, one would need the heavens themselves to intervene. I'm afraid no one possesses such power."

Another Saint Envoy gritted his teeth. "We're ordered to guard this place. No one is allowed near. Elder, are you making things difficult for us?"

The Elder replied calmly, "Not difficult. If you all turn a blind eye, the Stone Spirit Race will be forever grateful."

"Wishful thinking!" the previously injured Saint Envoy shouted. "Trespassing in the Blood Gate's forbidden land—today, you will surely die!"

The Elder sighed, "The Blood Gate's anomaly is a rare chance for ancient beings to reclaim ancestral glory. If the seal is broken and we enter, there's a chance to obtain a Divine Spirit Origin. You eight have long served the Four Great Saint Venerables, so you must know the Blood Gate's secrets. Rather than fight to the death, why not join forces and share the Origin Power within? Wouldn't that be wonderful?"

"I never knew the Elder was so eloquent. Today, this Lord has learned something new," the injured Saint Envoy snorted, mocking.

The Elder said, "Today, the Stone Spirit Race is all here. The Blood Gate's secret is ours for the taking. Anyone who blocks our future will be killed without mercy! Consider carefully, gentlemen."

With those words, the Eight Envoys' faces changed.

Previously, when dealing with the Elder, he seemed old and feeble, barely able to speak, so no one took him seriously. But today, he was so forceful and murderous, it was truly unexpected.

The burly Saint Envoy sighed, "If the Elder insists, we have no choice but to offend you."

The Stone Spirit Race's strength was not to be underestimated. If they fought these Stone Giants, victory was far from certain.

As they spoke, the Saint Envoy who had been struck by Xiaoxiao suddenly changed expression and shouted, "Despicable human, what are you doing!"

Everyone was startled, turning to the human who had first appeared. He was waving his hands, casting mysterious seals, and the space beside him twisted, as if it might collapse at any moment.

This scene shocked the Eight Envoys. They had no idea what mysterious power this human possessed to cause such spatial upheaval.

Yang Kai kept moving, grinned, and said, "Breaking the seal, Saint Envoy. What a strange question."

"Impudent!" the Saint Envoy's expression changed, shouting, "Stop at once, or this Lord will tear you to pieces!"

Yang Kai let out a cold snort. "I'm breaking this seal for the future of all the Divine Spirits in this Ancient Land. If you don't appreciate it, so be it—but to threaten my life over it? What kind of logic is that!"

"Human brat, stop spouting nonsense! Matters of the Ancient Land are not for you to meddle in!"

The Elder declared, "This young friend is a guest of the Stone Spirit Race. I asked him to break the seal."

"A mere First Stage Emperor, able to break the Blood Gate's seal? Ridiculous!"

The Elder replied, "This young friend is skilled in space power. Inside the Blood Gate is a separate world. If he can tear open the spatial barrier, he can naturally break the seal."

"Space power!" The Eight Envoys were shocked.

The Elder continued, "Gentlemen, the Blood Gate contains many Divine Spirit origins. You must have felt the resonance in your blood. If he truly breaks the seal, it will benefit you greatly."

The burly Saint Envoy said, "Of course we know, but the Saint Venerables have ordered..."

The Elder chuckled, "The Saint Venerables are not here. They've gone thousands of li away—they can't see us."

"The Saint Venerables aren't here?" The Eight Envoys were stunned, then turned to look where the Four Saint Venerables had been, finding it empty.

Instantly, everyone felt restless inside.

No one wanted to be inferior. The Eight Envoys were loyal to the Four Great Saint Venerables, but if they could advance their own strength, no one would pass up such an opportunity.

If this human really tore open the spatial barrier and unlocked the Blood Gate, they might enter and inherit the Divine Spirit Origin Power, regaining ancestral might.

But... who could guarantee the human would succeed? If he failed and the Saint Venerables learned they hadn't tried their best, they might be punished.

The Eight Envoys exchanged glances, each seeing the same thoughts in the others.

The burly Saint Envoy stepped forward, "Sorry, Elder, your words are tempting, but the Saint Venerables' orders cannot be disobeyed. Forgive us!"

As he finished, the Eight Envoys moved together, turning into eight streams of light, charging at the Stone Spirit Race.

"Stop them!" The Elder waved his staff forward.

At his command, except for Xiaoxiao, the other eight Stone Spirits—from Shi Yi to Shi Ba—leapt out, each blocking an Envoy.

Instantly, near the Blood Gate, Yao Yuan surged, Yao Qi rolled, and the Stone Spirits and the Eight Envoys battled fiercely, shaking the heavens and earth.

But soon, the eight Stone Spirits engaged in battle noticed something odd. The Eight Envoys weren’t fighting with their full strength—every attack was easily blocked, as if their opponents were holding back on purpose.

Though the Stone Spirits weren’t the brightest, they were far from fools. After all, they’d lived for countless years—how could they not see through the Eight Envoys’ intentions?

Each was secretly pleased, fighting their opponents with great spectacle. The bare mountain soon became a whirlwind of flying rocks, lively as could be.

Yang Kai saw this and understood—the Eight Envoys had been swayed by the Elder's words. Their actions were just for show, so the Four Saint Venerables wouldn't blame them later.

Even if they fought with all their might, they couldn't do anything to the Stone Spirit Race.

Since the Eight Envoys were willing to play along, Yang Kai had no worries. He threw himself into breaking the Blood Gate's seal, unleashing all his spatial powers without reservation.

Xiaoxiao and the Elder stood guard nearby, watching nervously.
