## Chapter 2564 — Kill the Man, Capture the Woman

Just as Yang Kai was preparing to strike while the iron was hot and press forward, the Third Disciple suddenly began to claw at her own hair with all her might, sobbing heartbreakingly, "Master, where are you? Your disciple can't find you..."

Strands of hair, stuck together, were yanked out by her and fell to the ground.

The scene was bleak, her tone sorrowful and self-reproaching, truly making those who heard it grieve and those who saw it shed tears.

Zhang Ruoxi's eyes instantly reddened, and she glanced at Yang Kai. She thought to herself, if one day Sir suddenly disappeared, she would definitely search for him, even if it took three thousand years, thirty thousand years—the passage of time would never stop her steps.

"Master!" Third Disciple suddenly shouted again, her body shooting skyward like a cannonball, twisting as she darted deep into the Ancient Land.

"Chase!" Yang Kai was both angry and helpless—angry that he had told the Third Disciple the truth, yet she ignored it, causing her mind to become even more chaotic; helpless because, given her current state, he truly couldn't reason with her.

For now, he could only pursue relentlessly, looking for a chance to knock the Third Disciple out—even if it meant hurting her a little, it couldn't be helped.

Carrying Zhang Ruoxi, he chased after her. Even though Yang Kai used his spatial powers and teleported several times, he still lost track of the Third Disciple after the time it takes for an incense stick to burn.

It had been like this before; if the Third Disciple hadn't shown herself again, he definitely wouldn't have found her.

But this time, the Third Disciple was agitated. It was unlikely she'd show herself again. Yang Kai looked around, annoyed.

He had finally experienced the Third Disciple's abilities—she could come and go freely in this damned place. He couldn't help but admire her.

Boom boom boom...

A commotion approached from afar, as if many people were coming this way. Clearly, the disturbance caused by Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi while chasing the Third Disciple had spread, attracting some attention.

Yang Kai frowned, looking toward the source of the sound, puzzled as to why so many people would suddenly appear in this Ancient Land.

He swept his Divine Sense in that direction and discovered the aura of an Emperor Realm expert. Moreover, this aura... didn't seem human.

Yao? Yang Kai immediately guessed.

Before long, numerous figures suddenly emerged from the dense forest to one side. Each of them had a fierce and menacing appearance, looking thoroughly unapproachable. Moreover, waves of Yao Qi rolled off their bodies, converging together until the energy surged skyward, unstoppable and overwhelming.

Sure enough, they were yao!

At the forefront stood a burly yao, wielding a bone spear that gleamed white and chilling, its origin unknown—perhaps forged from the bones of some fearsome demonic beast. The spear was over five zhang long, thick as a human thigh, yet he swung it with ease. He wore only simple beast hide, exposing his powerful, sculpted muscles, radiating a sense of raw strength. Beneath him crouched a steel-backed bristled pig, its tusks curling upward nearly two feet, nostrils flaring with hot breath, four hooves pawing restlessly at the earth, and its crimson beast eyes shone with a terrifying light.

The yao and his mount stood together, exuding an awe-inspiring presence, as if gods had descended to the mortal realm.

This was clearly a Yao General!

Beside the Yao General, about thirty or forty yao of varying strength spread out to either side, standing in disorder.

Dozens of eyes instantly locked onto Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi, sizing them up, mostly focusing on Zhang Ruoxi. After all, Zhang Ruoxi was stunning, her graceful figure always attracting male gazes, whether human or yao.

The scantily clad female yao immediately became displeased, glaring at Zhang Ruoxi with hostility, gritting their teeth and cursing under their breath. Occasionally, words like "wench" could be heard.

Zhang Ruoxi, on the other hand, curiously observed the sudden group. She had never seen yao before. She had seen many demonic beasts, but yao who could take human form were rare.

Seeing that these creatures appeared no different from ordinary people, she couldn't help but look a few more times.

She wasn't afraid, since Yang Kai was by her side. She had full confidence in him.

"Humans, you have guts, daring to trespass on this Lord's territory!" The burly Yao General sat atop the steel-backed bristled pig, pointing his bone spear at them, full of imposing presence.

Yang Kai's mouth twitched, unsure how to respond.

He knew that many yao lived in the Wild Ancient Land. Yao and demonic beasts were different—most demonic beasts lacked intelligence, only cultivating by instinct, absorbing Spiritual Qi. Though their lifespans were long, their strength rarely improved, and they couldn't take human form.

Yao were different. Though born from demonic beasts, they had awakened intelligence, knew how to cultivate more effectively, and even had yao-specific cultivation techniques.

In the entire Wild Ancient Land, yao were the strongest force. Besides yao, there were many primordial remnants—almost extinct races, few in number but extremely powerful, as they possessed primordial bloodlines and could display unimaginable abilities.

Yang Kai wasn't clear about the power divisions within the Ancient Land. The only information he had was from the jade slip Pi San had given him, which only covered the outskirts.

Seeing this group of yao appear, Yang Kai immediately realized that, in his pursuit of the Ice Heart Valley's Third Disciple, he had inadvertently entered this Yao General's territory.

"Kill! Kill! Kill!" The group of yao suddenly shouted, making anyone unaware think they were bandits blocking the road—it was quite amusing.

"The Lord is asking you!" The Yao General circled atop his mount, bone spear still pointed at Yang Kai, rudely demanding, "Have you seen a crazy woman?"

The Third Disciple?

Yang Kai hadn't wanted to waste words with this group, but hearing the question, it was clear they'd seen the Third Disciple. He shouted, "You've seen her?"

The Yao General grew furious, surging Yao Qi and snorting coldly, "It's the Lord asking you! If you don't want to suffer, answer honestly, or you'll learn how formidable I am."

Unable to reason with him, Yang Kai decided to act first. He grinned, "Then let me see for myself."

The Yao General sneered, "Since you seek death, don't blame me for being merciless!" He sat atop his mount, waved his hand, and ordered, "Kill the man, capture the woman!"

At his command, thirty or forty yao howled, moving like the wind. Yao Qi surged, leaves flew everywhere, and using the cover, the yao charged recklessly.

What the hell? Yang Kai was stunned. He knew yao were simple-minded, but hadn't expected them to be this simple—rushing out without even considering whether they were a match, not fearing being wiped out.

It was remarkable that this group had survived in the Ancient Land for so long.

But this was also because Yang Kai's strength and perspective had grown.

This group had a Yao General overseeing them, plenty of numbers, and the Primordial Power here suppressed human cultivators. Even if they encountered a Second Stage Emperor, they could attack together without fear.

Over the years, many Emperor Realm experts had died at their hands. Without some ability, they couldn't have survived here—there was no peace in this place; the weak had long since perished.

The yao charged, each using their own methods. Many revealed their true forms mid-air, and all sorts of strange demonic beasts roamed about. Yao secret techniques blasted forth, making even heaven and earth change color.

The Yao General stayed at the rear, unmoving, coldly watching.

A giant python spewed poisonous mist toward Yang Kai, filling the space and obscuring his view.

From within the mist, a figure suddenly tore through, attacking with gleaming fangs—a wolf-type demonic beast launching a sneak attack under cover.

Zing...

A soft clang rang out, a flash of cold light appeared and vanished. Yang Kai stood unmoving, yet somehow the Myriad Sword had already appeared in his hand.

The giant wolf flew past him, its crimson eyes flashing wildly, as if witnessing something terrifying.

Landing, its body rushed forward uncontrollably. With a splat, blood sprayed from its neck, its head separated from its body, twitching on the ground.

This yao only had Dao Origin Realm cultivation. Even with the mist's cover for a sneak attack, it was no match for Yang Kai—one strike, and it was dead.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh...

Seven or eight yao revealed their true forms, leaping from the mist, attacking from all directions.

Yang Kai's sword moved like a swimming dragon, cold light flashing constantly.

With several muffled sounds, all the attacking demonic beasts were sent flying, split in two mid-air, blood and entrails scattering, their miserable howls echoing.

The yao were momentarily silent, their charge halted, eyes wide in shock—they hadn't expected Yang Kai to be so powerful.

Drip drip drip...

Only the sound of blood dripping from the Myriad Sword remained, like a death knell, making the yao tremble in fear.

By now, they realized Yang Kai was different from the humans they'd encountered before—he was not to be trifled with.

"You brat, how dare you slaughter my kin! Prepare to die!" The Yao General, who had been lingering over Zhang Ruoxi's graceful figure with lecherous eyes, saw nearly ten of his own dead and flew into a rage. He spurred his mount and charged at Yang Kai, spear in hand.

The steel-backed bristled pig was some kind of exotic beast, incredibly fast. Its four hooves thundered, arriving in an instant. Trees as thick as several people were snapped at the base as it charged, showing its immense strength.

Seeing the General attack, the other yao quickly avoided him, turning to trouble Zhang Ruoxi instead.

Yang Kai snorted, wiped his fingers across the Myriad Sword, his expression solemn, and chanted, "Myriad Sword radiance, chase the moon and swallow the wolf!"

Sss sss sss sss...

As the broad sword danced, countless sword lights scattered outward like the ribs of a broken fan, radiating in all directions.
