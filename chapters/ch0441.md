## Chapter 441 — Your Face Is Really Big

“Thank you all for your consideration.” Yang Kai wore a glimmer of gratitude on his face. The last battle against Cangyun Evil Land had involved nearly every First-rate force, with each suffering losses—some greater, some lesser. He never expected that those individuals he had almost forgotten about would, because of his presence, persuade their senior sect elders to join the succession war.

Especially those from Wan Hua Palace, breaking precedents that had persisted for centuries. Yang Kai could imagine the many obstacles and resistance they had faced from their elders in making such a decision.

Most importantly, the events of last night had surely not reached their ears yet; they were unaware of the situation in War City. Despite not knowing Yang Kai’s current predicament, they came unhesitatingly to offer their support. That was what mattered most.

The friends he had made in foreign lands were truly sincere, coming to aid out of genuine gratitude. After all, Yang Kai had once saved their lives at the hands of martial artists from Tianlang Kingdom.

And these people were all the leading young figures within their respective sects!

“Shui Yue Hall, Wen Xin Palace, Fei Yu Pavilion, Wan Hua Palace…” Qiu Yimeng’s beautiful eyes sparkled, a seductive glow upon her cheeks as she sighed, “All are First-rate forces. Let alone the first three, but for Wan Hua Palace to come all for you in the succession war, Yang Kai, your face is truly big. How many friends have you made out there over these years?”

Dong Qinghan and Fan Hong also looked at Yang Kai with astonishment, puzzled by the breadth of his connections.

Chen Xueshu shook his head with a smile. “Actually, there are two more sects whose people we haven’t been able to contact. If we could, they would undoubtedly rush here too.”

“Oh? Which two sects?” Qiu Yimeng’s interest piqued; she was eager to probe Yang Kai’s background.

“One is the overseas Shura Sect, and the other is Senluo Palace from Tianlang Kingdom!”

Everyone moved with emotion.

Overseas Shura Sect! Only Qiu Yimeng fully understood the background of this sect. Though overseas, it was a First-rate force, no less powerful than those here in Dahan, possibly even surpassing them. These overseas sects occupied islands rich in Primordial Qi, producing materials unseen in Dahan. Such privileged conditions made cultivation easier for their martial artists.

As for Senluo Palace, everyone had heard the name!

A superpower of Tianlang Kingdom, their status equaled the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu. Anyone with even some insight wouldn’t be unfamiliar with them. All present were young masters and miss of First-rate force noble families—how could they not know the renown of Senluo Palace?

“Young Master Kai is impressive, not only knowing friends beyond the Sea of Consciousness, but also having ties with other nations. Fan Hong is truly impressed.”

“You bastard…” Qiu Yimeng grit her teeth, “When I asked before how many connections you had, you said none at all. I almost believed you. Hmph. I want to see how you still hide it now!”

Yang Kai chuckled lightly, shaking his head without explaining.

He hadn’t even counted the people Chen Xueshu mentioned among his contacts. Their gratitude and willingness to return the favor surprised and warmed him.

“Junior Brother Yang, since it really is you here, I’ll first report back so our sect can speed their arrival. Also, Fei Yu Pavilion, Wen Xin Palace, and Wan Hua Palace need to be informed. I guess they’re still guessing about matters, uncertain. Once they know you’re here, they’ll surely be delighted.” Chen Xueshu proposed excitedly.

Yang Kai nodded. “Much obliged.”

After a pause, he called out, “Ying Jiu!”

Within the great hall, a blurry figure appeared like a ghost, unnoticed by anyone regarding where he was or how he came. It seemed he had always been there. The faint ripples he caused slowly solidified into a form—thin and sharp-eyed Ying Jiu emerged into view.

Everyone’s expression changed to shock, especially the Divine Roaming Realm masters standing behind the young masters and misses. Even they had not sensed Ying Jiu’s aura before.

This elusive Blood Servant was truly extraordinary.

“At your service.”

“I will escort Senior Brother Chen out of the city!”

“Yes!”

Chen Xueshu and Shu Xiaoyu’s initial arrival to War City was unremarkable, but if they left by passing through the Yang Manor again, they would be regarded as enemies. Without protection, interception was inevitable.

Each member of the Yang Family had their own intelligence networks and naturally would suppress new powers.

Chen Xueshu understood this and did not refuse. He cupped his fist toward Ying Jiu seriously and respectfully. “Then I’ll trouble Senior Ying. Junior Brother Yang, my Junior Sister and I take our leave.”

“Little Sister Shu, you stay behind and deliver the messages alone,” Qiu Yimeng suddenly said with a smile. “Don’t misunderstand, I just want to know what this foreign training they speak of is about and what that bastard did to you to earn such gratitude.”

Upon hearing this, Chen Xueshu smiled slightly. “Very well, Junior Sister. You stay with Miss Qiu. I’ll go and return swiftly.”

With that, he cupped his fist toward Yang Kai and turned to leave.

Ying Jiu nodded and blurred again before vanishing.

“Qiu Yimeng, arrange for them,” Yang Kai instructed before turning to the others. “Make yourselves at ease. I suspect there will be no fighting for a while, so let’s take this chance to get to know one another.”

“What will you do?” Qiu Yimeng asked.

“Cultivate,” Yang Kai grinned broadly and strode away.

“Cultivation fanatic!” Qiu Yimeng shook her head with a bitter smile.

“His strength is no accident,” Huo Xingchen mused, then grinned again playfully. “If I had half his diligence, I wouldn’t be too bad either, right?”

Qiu Yimeng ignored him.

Inside his room, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the ground, examining the Black Book Space.

The recent frantic accumulation left it filled with all kinds of materials and supplies, including finished pills. Aside from a box of Earth-Grade treasures Huo Xingchen brought today, there was little in equipment treasures.

These finished treasures could be distributed to arm their forces.

Despite his resolve, Yang Kai could not help but feel moved seeing such a dazzling array of materials.

These supplies included medicinal herbs for alchemy, rare five-element metals, various pills, and materials seldom seen in the world—all gathered here.

With good alchemists and refiners, this cache of resources would produce many rare and useful pills and treasures.

Yang Kai was shocked to realize unconsciously that he had amassed wealth approaching that of a medium-sized family—and this was only the beginning.

The Bamboo Segment Gang continued to buy up circulating materials, and the arrival of numerous sects to seek refuge would only increase the supplies.

Not only Yang Kai gathered materials, other Yang Family disciples were doing the same, though he was ahead.

The first result of the Yang Family’s succession war was that prices for alchemy and refining materials soared.

As the materials rose in price, the status of alchemists and refiners also increased. Many gathered in War City and Zhongdu, awaiting summons from Yang Family sons, ready to serve.

Yesterday, the first day of the succession war, Yang Family sons were focused on claiming the first victories and had no time for other matters. Today, their manors all announced recruitment of high-level alchemists and refiners with excellent treatment. The higher the rank, the more valued.

Only Eighth Brother Yang Quan’s manor and Yang Kai’s had no announcements.

Yang Quan gave up hope of victory and did not bother recruiting, as he believed no alchemists or refiners would join him. Yang Kai, however, dismissed the external alchemists and refiners outright.

He had already made preparations!

He sorted the finished pills in the Black Book Space, extracting all those with Yang attribute and those that enhanced Divine Sense cultivation.

When he saw the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, Yang Kai’s expression involuntarily stiffened.

Where had Su Yan gone? He had sent hundreds from Bamboo Segment Gang to investigate, but no news came. Even the elders of Lingxiao Pavilion and Ling Taixu seemed to have vanished without trace.

Slightly sighing, Yang Kai knew Lingxiao Pavilion still bore the stigma of being an evil sect. The world still dreaded the presence of the evil lord. Until he won the succession war, he could not clear Lingxiao Pavilion’s name.

The title of an evil sect was not a big deal—the key was that the evil lord was born from Lingxiao Pavilion. That was why many feared Lingxiao Pavilion; if one evil lord could be raised, perhaps a second could be cultivated.

Gathering his mind, Yang Kai began absorbing the energy from the Yang attribute pills.

Eight Divine Roaming and above experts watched the city’s movements closely, making Yang Kai realize the danger. If he didn’t quickly break through to the Divine Roaming Realm, sooner or later those eight elders would discover his secret.

He was currently at the eighth stage of the True Essence Realm, only two minor realms short of Divine Roaming Realm—not far now.

After a day, he fully absorbed all the Yang attribute pills, clearly feeling his Yang Liquid in his dantian and True Essence in his meridians grow richer and purer.

He took out his long-unused incense burner again, lighting fragrant incense nearby while practicing the True Yang Technique. He freely used Divine Sense to probe the secrets of the True Alchemy Formula.

The fragrance in the burner subdued the speed of the True Yang Technique’s operation. Over time, the technique would adapt to this great pressure, and when the incense ceased, its speed would naturally increase—providing great advantage during combat.

Using Divine Sense to analyze the True Alchemy Formula was also the best method to cultivate Divine Sense itself.
