## Chapter 465 — Nine Steps Pressed Forward, Earth Annihilated and Heaven Condemned

Not only were the few members of the Yang Family stunned and uncertain, but the martial artists watching the spectacle below also revealed expressions of shock, all focusing their full attention on the sky above. They held their breath, condensing their Qi in silence as they waited.

The actions of the six from the Yang Family had long been the center of everyone’s attention, and naturally, the scene just now was firmly imprinted in their minds.

In midair, Yang Wei looked somewhat worried, unsure where his Ninth Brother had gained such confidence. Although he had his suspicions, knowing Yang Kai's mysterious strength, it was only conjecture. Before the treasure snatching, when Yang Kai had sparred verbally with Liu Qingyao, he had only secretly pinned his hopes on him without making it explicit.

If this Ninth Brother of his grew up, he would surely be qualified to contend with Liu Qingyao. But now... it was too early, the timing was not yet ripe.

After a moment's pause, Yang Kang and the others chuckled slyly, faces full of schadenfreude and anticipation. Though they were brothers to Yang Kai, they were now rivals and naturally eager for him to be defeated and humiliated by Liu Qingyao, having his reputation ruined.

Yang Kai had been too flamboyant before; now it was time for him to be struck down.

“Is this guy crazy?” came some mocking and incredulous voices from the crowd. “Daring to challenge Zhongdu’s number one, the Yang Family’s direct descendant — truly reckless!”

“Do you know anything? Under this circumstance, whether they accept the challenge or not, the Yang Family’s face will be lost in the end. It's like forcing a reluctant duck to fly. The Yang Family must at least show some action. Having the youngest member accept the challenge means that even if he loses, the Yang Family has an excuse. It's not that their men are inferior to the Liu Family's, but merely about age difference.”

Those who considered themselves clever saw through the trick, and many suddenly understood, nodding in agreement.

However, some were quietly observing Yang Kai, to see if he had some world-shaking means.

Yang Kai did not appear like a naïve fool; to dare speak arrogantly before Zhongdu’s number one meant either madness or genuine ability. Yang Kai was clearly not the former.

For a moment, all eyes converged on one man. The six factions of martial artists fiercely battling to seize the Heaven-Grade treasure long lost their audience.

In plain view of all, Yang Kai made no unusual moves. He simply stood defiantly midair, calm and composed, looking towards Liu Qingyao, extending a hand in invitation: “Young Master Liu. Please.”

Liu Qingyao furrowed his brows, displeasure darkening his arrogant face, and snorted lightly: “I want to see how you can withstand three of my attacks!”

As his words fell, an extraordinarily terrifying Divine Sense burst forth.

This Divine Sense was filled with an aura of destruction and domineering arrogance. It spread instantly, like a spear piercing the firmament, capable of tearing through any defense and shattering all willpower.

When this Divine Sense erupted, Liu Qingyao awoke like a slumbering dragon, bringing devastation to the world.

The Divine Soul treasures worn by the Yang Family members flickered violently, invisible forces emanating from them to block the residual Divine Sense waves of Liu Qingyao’s attack.

All of them turned pale; Yang Wei was especially solemn. The last time he fought Liu Qingyao, although defeated, it was not so terrible. It was clear now that Liu Qingyao had not wielded his full strength then.

No wonder he boasted about three attacks! Even now that Yang Wei had advanced two stages into the Divine Roaming Realm, facing three of Liu Qingyao’s attacks was difficult indeed.

Unlike the Yang Family disciples, Liu Qingyao carried nothing but Mystery-Grade treasures. With these high-level treasures augmenting him, his cultivation at the third stage of the Divine Roaming Realm was boosted several tiers!

Buzzing sounds reverberated in the void, bringing a sense of cataclysm, as if the heavens themselves could not endure this Divine Sense assault and were about to collapse.

“What immense Divine Sense power!” the strong onlookers exclaimed.

Those weaker were pained by the furious energy fluctuations.

They suddenly found even breathing difficult, as if a mountain pressed down upon their heads, inspiring a bewildering urge to kneel in submission.

“Ninth Brother, be careful!” Yang Wei called out sharply, hastily retreating to avoid the epicenter of the Divine Sense shockwave. Yang Zhao and others similarly withdrew, halting after over a hundred zhang, leering at the scene from afar.

“Powerful!” Within the whirlpool of Divine Sense power, Yang Kai’s eyes gleamed as he praised involuntarily.

Even enhanced by Mystery-Grade treasures, Liu Qingyao’s Divine Sense attack required a solid foundation—he was indeed unfathomable.

Yang Kai estimated Liu Qingyao’s Divine Sense intensity rivaled experts of the fifth or sixth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Liu Qingyao’s eyes were as sharp as a hawk, fixed steadily on Yang Kai, unleashing his Divine Sense attack as his opening move, clearly unwilling to grant Yang Kai the luxury of three attacks.

He merely considered Yang Kai stepping forward due to youth, thinking a loss would not be too humiliating, and thus aimed to finish Yang Kai in one, merciless strike.

But soon Liu Qingyao’s pupils trembled.

His Divine Sense strike struck without effect. While even Yang Wei and others had to flee a hundred zhang away, Yang Kai remained at the shockwave's center, as relaxed as a spring breeze, showing no discomfort but burning with fighting spirit.

In an instant, the terrifying Divine Sense dissipated completely; Yang Kai stood motionless.

He feared no Divine Sense attack!

“Heavens, how can this be? How is he unharmed? Am I mistaken?”

“Impossible, absolutely impossible!”

“The Divine Roaming Realm holds an absolute advantage over the True Essence Realm. Does the youngest Yang Family heir carry a high-grade Divine Soul defensive treasure as well?”

The crowd erupted with disbelieving shouts, unable to accept these results. After Liu Qingyao’s terrifying Divine Sense attack, all thought the battle was settled, and Yang Kai would suffer grievous injury for his arrogance. But now, they struggled to accept.

Even with Divine Soul treasures, defense could not be so flawless, right? They saw no reaction from any Divine Soul treasure on Yang Kai, as if he endured the blow solely on his own.

“Two more attacks!” Yang Kai grinned at Liu Qingyao.

“How do you...” Liu Qingyao frowned deeply, suspicion spreading across his face. As attacker, his shock was greater than anyone else’s. His expression tightened, becoming serious. He nodded slightly. “You do have some skill; I underestimated you.”

He stepped forward suddenly, and with that step, his aura shifted again. To Yang Kai, the Zhongdu number one suddenly grew several times larger, yet looking closer, Liu Qingyao remained the same.

Yang Kai’s expression turned grave, realizing this was an illusion triggered by Liu Qingyao’s martial skill, so he tightened his mind and braced himself.

Another step, and though focusing fully, Yang Kai could not resist the flash of a mental wave. Liu Qingyao appeared yet larger, though only momentarily.

The third step...

With that footfall came a deep, muffled thud from the depths of the void.

Like a giant war drum struck, the booming sound resounded in everyone's hearts.

“Nine-Curve Steps of the Liu Family!” Yang Wei’s face changed slightly, voice low and urgent.

The energy of heaven and earth twisted into a bizarre state. Liu Qingyao transformed into a bottomless pit, ravenously devouring the surrounding Spiritual Qi.

The fourth step...

Boom!

Even fiercer reverberations echoed in the hearts, causing weaker martial artists to feel their Qi and blood surging uncontrollably, their True Essence wavering.

The fifth step...

One after another came muffled moans. Below the fifth stage of the True Essence Realm, no martial artist remained untouched—all spat blood.

From such a distance, Liu Qingyao’s moves caused such reactions. No wonder he was Zhongdu’s number one!

The sixth and seventh steps...

Each footfall emitted powerful thuds. The world vibrated, trembling, as if the heavens could no longer bear his stomp.

As the steps mounted, Liu Qingyao quickly grew larger before everyone’s eyes, until now this Zhongdu number one had become a colossal being towering with head touching sky and feet trampling earth, forcing all to gaze up at him.

The eighth and ninth steps...

Spectators saw Liu Qingyao’s massive foot, capable of leveling half a War City, lowering slowly and menacingly at Yang Kai’s head, with no way to evade—one felt inevitably to be crushed into powder.

This thought struck many with visceral dread. Faces drained of color, trembling in fear.

The Nine-Curve Steps of the Liu Family, a middle-level Mystery-Grade martial skill, had always been a closely guarded secret.

Nine steps pressed forward, earth destroyed and heaven condemned!

Just as the massive foot was about to descend on Yang Kai, the youngest son of the Yang Family finally acted.

His right fist clenched tightly, a dazzling, mysterious starry pattern abruptly appearing in daylight, sparkling with countless stars, stunningly beautiful. As his fist swung, stars flickered brilliantly.

Star Mark! Yang Kai had long refrained from using this move—not for lack of desire, but no chance previously.

The energy contained within the star map on his hand exploded forth at once, directly confronting that descending colossal foot without flourish.

A momentum as radiant as a rainbow burst out, blindingly brilliant, seeming able to pierce through heaven and earth.

Boom...

The powerful energies collided violently, surging and raging in all directions, mutually negating.

The starry light rapidly dimmed, yet the enormous, outrageous Liu Qingyao seemed thrown into disarray, his foot heavy as it remained suspended—no matter what, it could not land.

The Liu Family’s Nine-Curve Steps were actually stopped head-on!

And this young man only possessed the eighth stage of the True Essence Realm!

All were shocked, eyes wide with disbelief, their minds in turmoil, hardly able to accept the scene before them.
