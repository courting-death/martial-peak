## Chapter 2060 — Missing

A few days later, Yang Kai returned to Fenglin City.

After passing through the city gate, Yang Kai did not even have time to report his safety to Kang Siran; he hurried straight back to the rented cave dwelling where he was staying.

Taking out his token, Yang Kai poured Origin Qi into it and waved it toward the dwelling's sealing formation.

To his astonishment, the dwelling's formation gave no response, as if his token had lost all function.

He frowned at this, but soon recalled something.

When he had first come to Fenglin City, the rental period for the cave dwelling had been one year, and by now that term should have expired about two months ago.

Once the term expired, the right to use the dwelling would surely be taken back.

Yang Kai felt a chill in his chest and realized matters might not be good.

It would not be the end of the world if the dwelling's term had passed; at worst he could go to the City Lord's Mansion to register and rent another one. It would only cost a few Source Crystals.

He had not left anything too valuable in the dwelling, so there was little to worry about in that regard.

But... before he left, that little maid from the Zhang Family had still been staying in the dwelling.

At the time he and Kang Siran had gone to Primordial Cauldron Mountain to explore Gongsun Mu's dwelling, they did not expect to be delayed so long; he had thought he would return before long and had not given Zhang Ruoxi any detailed explanation, only telling her he was going out and leaving her there alone.

Now that the dwelling's term had expired and the usage rights had been reclaimed, where was Zhang Ruoxi?

Yang Kai looked around but did not see the frail figure, and could not help feeling anxious.

When he left, Zhang Ruoxi only had the First Stage of the Saint King Realm, and in this chaotic Fenglin City she had little ability to protect herself; if someone with ill intent set their sights on her, the consequences would be unimaginable.

"Could she have gone back to the Zhang Family?" Yang Kai muttered to himself.

Putting himself in Zhang Ruoxi's position, if the dwelling's usage had been revoked and she had been driven out, she would surely go back to the Zhang Family first. If that were the case, there would be nothing to worry about; after all, though the Zhang Family was not powerful, they still had two Void King Realm experts.

Just as Yang Kai was at a loss, a wave of fluctuation from the formation came from beside him.

He was startled and turned to see the dwelling's main door open, a young woman's face peeking out. The woman looked to be around thirty. Her beautiful eyes scanned Yang Kai warily as she asked, "Who are you?"

Yang Kai quickly cupped his fist and said, "I am Yang Kai. I was the previous owner of this dwelling."

The woman frowned and said, "I rented this dwelling. When I entered, there was nothing left inside."

"I know. I'm not here to look for things," Yang Kai said with a faint smile, trying to appear friendlier.

"Not looking for things?" The woman looked more puzzled. "Then what are you here for?"

"To look for someone, a young girl," Yang Kai hurriedly said. "She was supposed to live here, but now she is gone. Madam, have you seen her?"

Upon hearing he was looking for someone, the woman's brows knitted and her expression shifted; she quickly shook her head and said, "I haven't seen her."

As she spoke she drew her head back and closed the door.

"Wait!" Seeing this, Yang Kai instantly realized she must know something. How could he let her retreat so easily? He thrust out a hand and braced the door, stopping it from closing.

The woman's face changed drastically and she cried sharply, "What are you trying to do? This is Fenglin City!"

Yang Kai snorted coldly, stepped into the dwelling, shut the door behind him, and fixed the woman with a chilling gaze; at the same time, a powerful aura erupted from within him and pressed toward her.

"Dao Origin Realm!" The woman cried out when she perceived the terrifying aura, and the look in her beautiful eyes changed.

In Fenglin City, fighters were generally low-level; Dao Origin Realm experts were uncommon, and each one had deep backing and was not to be provoked by ordinary martial artists.

So when she sensed Yang Kai's realm, the woman became flustered.

She was only at the First Stage of the Void King Realm; she could not withstand the pressure of a Dao Origin Realm expert. Though she tried to endure, her body went limp and she had to brace herself against the wall to stay upright.

Biting her lip, she begged Yang Kai, "Young Brother, we have no grievances between us; I have never wronged you. Please do not make things hard for me..."

"I will not make things hard for you," Yang Kai said coldly. "I will only ask a few questions. Answer them truthfully; if you dare to lie, I will make it so you can neither live nor die! You should know I have that capability."

The woman gritted her teeth and nodded slightly.

"Good. I ask you, did you see that girl?" Yang Kai's eyes bore into her, watching for any change.

She hesitated a moment, then painfully nodded. "I don't know if the girl I saw is the one you mean, but I did see a young girl standing at the dwelling's gate..."

"Describe her—about how old, what realm, any distinguishing features," Yang Kai urgently asked.

"About sixteen or seventeen years old, her realm was the peak of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, almost breaking into the Third Stage. She looked delicate, with a slender figure, spoke softly, and had straight, glossy black hair..."

"That's definitely her." Yang Kai's eyes lit up, certain the woman had seen Zhang Ruoxi. He had not expected that in less than a year Zhang Ruoxi's realm would have advanced from the First Stage to the peak of the Second Stage and be on the verge of breaking through the Third Stage.

It seemed the girl had good aptitude; of course, the Marrow Cleansing Pill had surely helped.

"You said you saw her at the gate? What was she doing there?" Yang Kai asked, frowning again.

The woman said, "She was just standing at the gate..."

"Standing?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

"Yes, standing right there. I rented this place two months ago; she was at the gate then, and I didn't pay much attention. Later I noticed she just stood there without moving. Curious, I asked her and she told me she was waiting for a Sir Yang... Young Brother, are you that Sir Yang?"

As she asked, she timidly looked up at Yang Kai and found him stunned.

Yang Kai's mind churned with emotion.

He could not help picturing a scene: among the throngs in Fenglin City, at the gate of the dwelling, a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl stood quietly in place, enduring wind and sun without moving, occasionally glancing about, yet never seeing the familiar figure she waited for...

In the clamor of the city she was like someone abandoned: lonely, bewildered, helpless.

Night fell, the cold wind came, and she could only curl up there and tremble...

At dawn she opened her eyes and resumed waiting.

Yang Kai's mood weighed inexplicably heavy.

"I felt sorry for her and invited her in to sit, but she refused and insisted on standing there waiting... Sir Yang, Young Brother, I really did not harm her; please do not make things hard for me." The woman looked terrified, fearing Yang Kai's wrath.

“Since you haven’t done anything to her, why didn’t you tell me the truth from the start? The instant I asked where she was, you tried to shut the door—if that isn’t a guilty conscience, what is?” Yang Kai’s gaze was cold as he looked at the young woman, heavy killing intent flashing deep in his eyes.

The woman seemed to sense something, shuddered, and hurriedly waved her hand. "No, no, it's not as you think... I really haven't harmed her."

"Speak. Where is she now? You look as if you know something," Yang Kai said coldly.

The woman shook her head.

Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “It seems you’re wary of something.”

"Young Brother, don't push me. Spare me and I'll do whatever you ask," the woman pleaded, her tone suggestive; her eyes suddenly filled with moisture.

Yang Kai remained indifferent. A strange power gathered around his fingertip as his voice grew low and impatient: "Tell me, or die!"

As he spoke he slowly thrust his finger toward the woman's forehead.

Seeing Yang Kai's ruthlessness, the woman finally panicked and blurted out, "Go to the Jiang Family... maybe you can find her there!"

"The Jiang Family?" Yang Kai's finger paused three inches from her forehead; the power at his fingertip vanished abruptly as he looked at her thoughtfully. "No wonder you were so scrupulous. So it's the Jiang Family. But... why would the Jiang Family take her away?"

"I don't know!" The woman shook her head. "About a month ago a few men came and spoke with her, and she then left with them. Out of curiosity I followed and saw they went into the Jiang Family's place. I really don't know anything else; even if you kill me it won't help!"

"She left with them voluntarily?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Yes!" The woman nodded.

"Good. Thank you for your honest information, madam. Farewell." Yang Kai cupped his fist, flashed past her, and rushed out.

After Yang Kai left, the woman collapsed to the ground like a puddle of rotten mud, her clothes soaked with sweat.

She was unaffiliated and had reached the First Stage of the Void King Realm through her own efforts and luck; she had never encountered a Dao Origin Realm expert. Being intimidated so closely by Yang Kai had truly frightened her half to death.

Fortunately Yang Kai was reasonable and had not actually harmed her, otherwise she would have had no way to resist.

After recovering for a while, the woman sprang up, hurried into the dwelling, and quickly packed her things.

Not long after, she left the dwelling, headed straight for the city gate, and soon departed Fenglin City.

She dared not stay in Fenglin City any longer; if the Jiang Family investigated and found her involved, her trouble would be great. As far as she knew, the Jiang Family's people were not as easy to reason with as that Mr. Yang.
