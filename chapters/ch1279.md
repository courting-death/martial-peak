## Chapter 1279 — It's Really You

Seeing this young woman speak, Gong Xinghe's expression cleared a bit and he nodded, "Fu'er, tell me—what's the plan?"

The young woman smiled at his words. "Has Father really forgotten? Under my tutelage there is also a disciple who cultivates the Thousand Illusions Glaze skill."

The woman and Gong Xinghe were plainly father and daughter, and both were experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; such a pairing wasn't rare on Dark Star, because the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm is the practical limit for warriors here, so many great Sects had fathers and sons, masters and disciples sharing the same Realm.

From how Gong Xinghe addressed the woman and from what she said, it became clear she was Gong Aofu who Daiyuan had mentioned to Yang Kai and who lived on Wanren Peak.

"Thousand Illusions Glaze…" The moment Gong Xinghe heard those words, a trace of apprehension flickered in his eyes; the other elders shared that expression, as if recalling something, their faces growing complex.

"The junior who lives on Qianhuan Peak?" Gong Xinghe's odd look soon vanished and he asked calmly.

"Indeed." Gong Aofu inclined her head slightly.

"Where is she now?" Gong Xinghe asked.

"She seems to be heading this way. She likely saw what happened here." As Gong Aofu spoke she turned to glance aside, and there a streak of azure rainbow was rapidly racing toward them.

They waited a moment and the azure streak flew close, paused slightly, then revealed a graceful figure.

But when everyone saw the face clearly, more than a few displayed surprised expressions.

The newcomer was of course Daiyuan, who had hurried here—she apparently knew this place would gather many mid- and high-ranking members of the Sect. Daiyuan showed no panic; she first performed a proper salute to Gong Xinghe and said, "Qianhuan Peak disciple Daiyuan, greetings, Sect Lord!"

Gong Xinghe inclined his head lightly and said nothing more.

Daiyuan then saluted Gong Aofu and greeted the other elders and seniors.

Gong Aofu's brows knit slightly as she swept her Divine Sense over Daiyuan and asked suspiciously, "Yuan'er, what have you been doing these days? Your Qi and blood seem a bit depleted."

Daiyuan bowed her head and replied, "Your disciple had an error while cultivating. It's nothing major. Please don't worry, Master."

Though she said this, Daiyuan's expression remained detached, as if going through the motions mechanically.

Seeing this, Gong Xinghe frowned but did not press her attitude. "Your master said you can probe beneath Glazed Mountain—can you?"

"Probe Glazed Mountain?"

"Yes. We suspect an underground formation has been damaged. We don't know whether it was sabotaged or deteriorated on its own, so we need you to take a look and see if there are any problems."

"The Sect raised and nurtured me; if the Sect has a use for me, Daiyuan will not refuse!" Daiyuan replied calmly.

Hearing this, Gong Aofu opened her mouth as if to say something but held back, only saying, "If so, go investigate and report back to us."

"As you command!" Daiyuan did not hesitate. She closed her eyes, circulated her cultivation, and soon Glazed Light burst from her slight form exactly like the radiance from Glazed Mountain itself—only it was less than one ten-millionth of the mountain's brilliance. That Glazed Light flickered around her, coalesced into a beam, shot out, and in an instant dove into Glazed Mountain.

Seeing this, many elders who had never witnessed Thousand Illusions Glaze grew interested; the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain was not restrained by the Five Elements and could bind body and soul, so even if their Realms far exceeded Daiyuan's they could not send Divine Sense or apply methods to probe beneath Glazed Mountain.

Yet Daiyuan, a Saint King at the Third Stage, had easily achieved the feat, leaving them intrigued and also somewhat stunned.

They of course knew of the Thousand Illusions Glaze and the dangers of practicing it, so after a moment's consideration they no longer paid Daiyuan close attention and waited in silence.

After a long while, the light that had flown into Glazed Mountain suddenly reappeared and shot back into Daiyuan's slight body.

Many high elders of Liuli Gate looked to Daiyuan, awaiting her answer.

Daiyuan still kept her eyes closed, as if perceiving something; after a long time she opened them, bowed, and said, "Reporting, Sect Lord, Master— the formation beneath Glazed Mountain is indeed damaged, and beside the formation there appears to be the corpse of a demonic beast. It seems this beast triggered the formation, and was not only killed by it but also caused the formation to be damaged."

"A demonic beast?" The Du family beauty's face shifted slightly. "It can't be a Drill-Mountain Beast, can it?"

"No." The man surnamed Ma looked puzzled. "By all rights a Drill-Mountain Beast shouldn't damage the formation. It has probed in there many times without incident—why would this time be different?"

The Du beauty looked at Daiyuan and asked with a faint smile, "Young junior, you didn't probe incorrectly, did you? The Drill-Mountain Beast was purchased from the Myriad Beasts Sect specifically for handling demonic beasts here; it shouldn't destroy formations."

"I can't say. These are the results I sensed; if Elder Du doesn't trust me, she can use other methods to investigate herself." After speaking this Daiyuan's face paled, seeming fatigued from using Thousand Illusions Glaze.

The Du beauty forced a smile and couldn't press further. If she had the ability to investigate in detail she wouldn't need Daiyuan's help; nevertheless she and Elder Ma had been guarding this place and now that Glazed Mountain had problems they bore some responsibility.

"If it's the Drill-Mountain Beast, that's not serious. We only need to repair the arrays. If the underground formation is ruined, we'll find other means to mend it." A thoughtful expression crossed Gong Xinghe's face, but he did not question Daiyuan further.

"Father… if it really is the Drill-Mountain Beast, should we check the visitors from these past days?" Gong Aofu asked, glancing at Daiyuan—she had learned from Yin Sudie that Daiyuan had received visitors a few days prior.

"Decide that yourselves." Gong Xinghe waved his hand, then turned and, his body flickering, vanished oddly.

With the Sect Lord gone, many elders secretly breathed easier. The man surnamed Ma and the Du beauty exchanged looks; the former spoke, "Although by Daiyuan's probe the formation's damage is unrelated to outsiders, I still feel something is off. Elder Du has raised that Drill-Mountain Beast for over thirty years with no mishap—this time's accident may conceal unknown causes."

Hearing this, everyone understood he sought to shift blame; if outsiders were responsible, his and Elder Du's liability would be lessened. They all laughed and distanced themselves, saying the matter was for Elder Ma and Elder Du to handle and they would not interfere.

Elder Ma readily accepted and set about fully investigating recent visitors with Elder Du.

Daiyuan, pale-faced, approached Gong Aofu, bowed, and said, "Master, your disciple will return to rest."

"Mm—well done. Before one has small success with Thousand Illusions Glaze one generally shouldn't use Glazed Light. From the loss of Yuan Qi you've suffered this time, it's clear you've taken a heavy toll. Return to Qianhuan Peak and recuperate for several months—take this Hundred Spirals Pill, it will replenish your Yuan Qi." With that, Gong Aofu tossed a pill toward Daiyuan.

Daiyuan accepted it, thanked her, and respectfully withdrew. Being told to recuperate fit her plans—she had intended to rest for months to then attempt the Origin Returning Realm breakthrough.

The elders of Liuli Gate busied themselves repairing formations and arrays. Once Daiyuan returned to Qianhuan Peak she went straight to the room Yang Kai had previously occupied.

Standing inside, surveying left and right, Daiyuan's beautiful eyes shifted with unsettled expression.

After a while she circulated Saint Yuan and the Glazed Light burst again from her body, drilling into the earth and vanishing. Narrowing her eyes she probed and perceived for a long time, then suddenly trembled and revealed an incredulous expression, whispering, "It's really you!"

Previously, while probing Glazed Mountain, she had noticed a small hole at its base, as if something had burrowed in, and it seemed much of the Thousand Illusions Glaze had been removed from inside the mountain.

But while following the subterranean channel she found, to her shock, that it led to her own Qianhuan Peak!

Although the entire channel had been deliberately repaired, imperceptible traces remained; under the cover of Glazed Light none could hide.

Alarmed and uncertain, Daiyuan dared not speak plainly, for she vaguely suspected Yang Kai might be involved. Unable to be certain, she prudently blamed the Drill-Mountain Beast; yet that beast hadn't been killed by the formation—it looked as if something had slapped it to death.

Returning to Qianhuan Peak and investigating confirmed her earlier suspicion.

Under the very room Yang Kai had lived in there was indeed a matching channel leading toward the location of Glazed Mountain.

Qianhuan Peak had only hosted Yang Kai and Yang Yan as guests over the years—if not them, it would be strange indeed.

Daiyuan didn't know what miraculous method Yang Kai had used to open a passage from here to the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain and to hollow out such a large section from within the mountain.

But she understood that if this were exposed, the Liuli Gate would hunt Yang Kai down; the Sect's high elders would never forgive his way of collecting Thousand Illusions Glaze without using the Thousand Illusions Glaze skill.
