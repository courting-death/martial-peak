## Chapter 2249 — Ning Yuanshu

“Of course Patriarch knows this.” Qin Chaoyang gave a bitter smile. “But my Qin Family has its roots in Fenglin City, so we can’t stay out of it… Those first- and second-tier Sect experts who came to Fenglin City didn’t want to stay in inns, so they sought out the major local families. The Zhou, Du, Liang, and Xin families have all hosted quite a few people, and even the City Lord’s Mansion has been taken over by people from Fei Sheng Palace!”

“Even the City Lord’s Mansion…” Qin Yu couldn’t help but cover her red lips with her hand.

Qin Chaoyang said, “Fei Sheng Palace at least has an Emperor Realm expert holding down the fort. The City Lord is only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—how could he compete with such a force? By comparison, my Qin Family only has one force staying with us, which is already pretty good. The City Lord’s Mansion… tsk tsk, that’s where things are really dire.”

“What happened?” Qin Yu asked in confusion.

Qin Chaoyang’s face darkened. “Zhuang Pan has returned!”

“What?” Qin Yu’s expression changed, and she gritted her teeth. “That coward, he actually has the nerve to come back?”

Back when the Demonic Qi besieged the city, everyone formed the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Grand Array and charged out to reinforce the seal. But at the critical moment, Zhuang Pan, that coward, abandoned everyone and fled, causing the array to collapse on its own.

In the end, Duan Yuanshan managed to turn the tide, bringing Qin Chaoyang and Qin Yu back to Fenglin City, but the sealing matter was left incomplete. What happened afterward, they didn’t know—only that the three Great Emperors arrived, and then the Demonic Qi retreated on its own.

Zhuang Pan had vanished since then.

He had been the Deputy City Lord of Fenglin City, assisting Duan Yuanshan in managing the area for tens of thousands of li. After he left, the deputy position remained vacant.

Duan Yuanshan had even tried to recruit Yang Kai to fill Zhuang Pan’s spot, but Yang Kai politely declined.

Because of what happened last time, the Qin Family, Duan Yuanshan, and others all held a strong grudge against Zhuang Pan. Duan Yuanshan even said publicly that if he ever saw Zhuang Pan again, he would kill him!

Who would have thought that after a few months, this guy would return? How could Qin Yu not be surprised?

Qin Chaoyang snorted coldly. “He didn’t just have the nerve to come back—he returned in high spirits!”

“What happened?” Qin Yu frowned, sensing something was off.

“What else? He’s thrown in with Fei Sheng Palace!” Qin Chaoyang sneered. “He’s the one who brought the Fei Sheng Palace people to the City Lord’s Mansion. The City Lord’s days… must be miserable now.”

Hearing this, Qin Yu fell silent, as if she could imagine Duan Yuanshan’s helplessness.

Now that Zhuang Pan had thrown in his lot with Fei Sheng Palace, he was clearly using their power to act high and mighty before Duan Yuanshan. With such a formidable backer behind him, there was nothing Duan Yuanshan could do against him; instead, he had to watch Zhuang Pan’s mood and act accordingly. The roles of master and subordinate had been completely reversed, leaving Duan Yuanshan feeling stifled and aggrieved.

Now, the City Lord’s Mansion was little more than an empty shell.

“None of the families are having an easy time. The Zhou, Du, Liang, and Xin families are all in chaos. Old Xin Gaojie has come to complain to me more than once…” Qin Chaoyang sighed and shook his head.

“What about our Qin Family…” Qin Yu hesitated.

"For now, we’re fine," Qin Chaoyang said gravely. "The ones staying with us are from a sect called the Eight Directions Sect. It’s a mid-tier sect, and the leader is a young man who keeps to himself and cultivates diligently. He hasn’t asked anything of our Qin Family. The others are also fairly easy to get along with."

“That’s good.” Qin Yu relaxed at his words.

“Compared to the others, our Qin Family is doing pretty well.” Qin Chaoyang smiled slightly.

As they spoke, they suddenly heard hurried footsteps outside, as if a servant was rushing over.

Qin Chaoyang frowned.

Soon, a maid’s voice came from outside the door: “Patriarch…”

The voice trembled, betraying her unstable emotions.

“Yu’er, rest well. Patriarch will be right back.” Qin Chaoyang didn’t want trivial matters to disturb Qin Yu, so he spoke gently and turned to leave.

“Patriarch…” Qin Yu called after him, “Be careful.”

Qin Chaoyang nodded lightly, left the room, closed the door, and fixed his sharp gaze on the maid waiting outside.

The maid’s eyes were full of tears. She was about to speak, but Qin Chaoyang’s look silenced her.

The next moment, Qin Chaoyang strode away, the maid following close behind.

Only when they were far enough from Qin Yu’s room did Qin Chaoyang say, “What is it? Speak now.”

“Patriarch…” The maid quickly recounted what had just happened.

Qin Chaoyang’s face darkened at her words, and in a flash, he rushed toward the outer courtyard.

In the boudoir, Qin Yu said to Hui’er, “Help me up.”

Hui’er was startled. “Miss, what are you doing?”

“I want to take a look. I just have a feeling of unease, as if something is about to happen.” Qin Yu said gravely.

“With Patriarch outside, what could happen? Besides, you’re not well enough to get up.”

“Will you help or not?” Qin Yu’s beautiful eyes glared.

Hui’er panicked. “Miss, I don’t dare. If Patriarch finds out…”

“Then I’ll get up myself…” Qin Yu gritted her teeth and slowly sat up. Even such a simple movement left her sweating and groaning in pain.

Hui’er watched anxiously, like an ant on a hot pan, trying everything to persuade her, but Qin Yu wouldn’t listen. In the end, she could only help while crying.

…

City Lord’s Mansion.

In the main hall, a man of about twenty sat at the head seat. Though he looked dignified, he gave off an extremely sinister feeling, as if he was always plotting something.

His cultivation wasn’t high—only First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—but his bearing was far beyond that of ordinary Sect disciples.

This was Fei Sheng Palace’s current Young Palace Master, Ning Yuanshu.

After the previous Young Palace Master, Ning Yuancheng, died mysteriously, his younger brother Ning Yuanshu was made Young Palace Master.

Beside Ning Yuanshu stood two Third Stage Dao Origin Realm experts. One had a blank face and closed eyes, the other looked stern, with white hair and a youthful face.

These two were Fei Sheng Palace’s Left and Right Protectors, Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

On the left stood Gao Shan, on the right Liu Shui—both masters of musical arts, adept at sound-based attacks. Their methods were elusive and inscrutable, and their strength was nothing short of formidable.

At this moment, Ning Yuanshu was tasting spirit fruit at the table, smiling.

Below him, former Deputy City Lord Zhuang Pan watched Duan Yuanshan coldly, his face full of contempt and pride.

The one he was looking at was none other than Duan Yuanshan.

The Drunken Old Man, face flushed and reeking of alcohol, stood beside Duan Yuanshan, looking dazed and unfocused.

“I wonder why Young Palace Master summoned the two of us?” Duan Yuanshan suddenly asked, cupping his fists, his face unhappy.

Anyone would be upset if their home was taken over, but with the strength of the two Protectors and Fei Sheng Palace’s backing, Duan Yuanshan dared not resist and could only accept their occupation of the City Lord’s Mansion. He and the Drunken Old Man had kept to themselves these days, not meddling in anything.

Who would have thought Ning Yuanshu would suddenly summon them today?

“If you were summoned, of course there’s something for you to do. Can’t you see the Young Palace Master is enjoying spirit fruits? Just wait quietly!” Zhuang Pan suddenly snapped.

A few months ago, he’d clashed with Yang Kai, and his Secret Treasure had been destroyed, nearly costing him his life. At that time, Duan Yuanshan hadn’t helped him, but instead scolded him on Yang Kai’s behalf.

Zhuang Pan had held a grudge ever since. Now that he’d turned things around, he couldn’t wait to repay that humiliation a hundredfold.

“Hic…” The Drunken Old Man suddenly let out a loud burp, and the hall was instantly filled with the smell of alcohol.

Ning Yuanshu frowned and lost interest in the spirit fruit, putting it down in annoyance.

“City Lord… hic, this old man… mm… why do I hear a dog barking… uh…” He spoke in broken sentences, looking utterly disheveled.

“You…” Zhuang Pan was furious. The insult in those words was obvious—how could he not hear it?

Ning Yuanshu waved his hand, stopping him from making a scene.

Zhuang Pan immediately fell silent, glaring venomously at the Drunken Old Man, as if to remember this grudge.

“City Lord Duan!” Ning Yuanshu greeted Duan Yuanshan with a smile.

The latter frowned.

Though the other party smiled, to Duan Yuanshan he felt like a venomous snake flicking its tongue, extremely dangerous, making his heart tremble.

“What does Young Palace Master wish?” Duan Yuanshan asked in a low voice.

“This time, when I left the Palace, my father specially sent the two Protectors, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, with me. They are second only to my father in strength and rarely leave the palace. Do you know why?” He smiled.

Duan Yuanshan thought, ‘Your father sent people to protect you—what’s that got to do with me? Isn’t it normal for Young Masters to have bodyguards?’

That’s what he thought, but he said, “I don’t know.”

“Heh…” Ning Yuanshu smiled. “Of course, it’s to protect my safety…”

Duan Yuanshan’s face darkened, as if to say, ‘Are you kidding me?’ If it were that simple, why ask?

Sure enough, Ning Yuanshu’s tone changed. “My father said the public order in Fenglin City… is very bad!”

Duan Yuanshan frowned. “What do you mean by that? I’ve managed Fenglin City for years. The cultivators here may not all be good people, but murder and robbery are rare. I can’t agree that public order is bad.”
