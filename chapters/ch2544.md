## Chapter 2544 — Bitter Melon Face

Qi Hefeng clasped his fists solemnly and said, "Thank you, Sir."

Although Yang Kai was forced to act at this moment, as long as he could drive away these Yin-Soul ghosts, he would be everyone's savior. Qi Hefeng's words of thanks were only natural.

"You all go to the rear and guard," Yang Kai said, his figure flickering as he appeared before the four blocking the cave entrance.

The four, hearing this, retreated behind Yang Kai as if their feet were greased, their movements swift and decisive.

As soon as the four withdrew, countless Yin-Soul ghosts roared and charged madly inward, each one hideous and terrifying, making everyone worry for Yang Kai, unsure if he could hold them off alone.

The Emperor Realm was truly formidable, but Yang Kai had been fighting here for a day and a half, and was inevitably somewhat spent.

Now, he had become everyone's only hope, and naturally, no one wanted anything to happen to him.

Under everyone's watchful eyes, Yang Kai stood as steady as a mountain, unmoving. Only when the Yin-Soul ghosts were three inches from his face did his Divine Soul power suddenly erupt like a tsunami.

Boom...

It was as if an invisible wall stood before Yang Kai, blocking all the charging Yin-Soul ghosts outside. Not only that, under the invisible strangling force, these Yin-Soul ghosts dissolved at an astonishing speed, their shrill screams echoing.

The scene was like snowflakes falling from the sky meeting the blazing sun—wherever the sunlight touched, the snow melted away.

But that wasn't all. Yang Kai swept out with the Myriad Sword, unleashing a fierce attack that sent sword light streaking out like meteors chasing the moon.

More Yin-Soul ghosts were slaughtered in swathes.

Although such attacks were less effective against Yin-Soul ghosts than Divine Sense attacks, Yang Kai was, after all, in the Emperor Realm, and the Myriad Sword was an Imperial Treasure. Its power was not to be underestimated.

Ordinary Yin-Soul ghosts and Ghost Generals were shattered upon contact, reduced to dust, while only the stronger Ghost Commanders barely survived, forced to flee far away.

Seeing this, everyone in the cave was invigorated, the gloom and despair in their eyes vanishing, replaced by excitement.

"Friend, you don't look well," Qi Hefeng suddenly turned to a bitter melon-faced man beside him, concern on his face. "Are you badly hurt?"

The bitter melon-faced man showed a flash of panic, but quickly concealed it and shook his head. "Thank you for your concern, Brother Qi. The injury isn't serious. A bit of rest and I'll be fine."

Qi Hefeng smiled slightly and said, "That's good. With this Sir's help, our lives are safe. Once this crisis passes, he'll be our savior."

The bitter melon-faced man didn't know why Qi Hefeng was chatting with him, but though he was impatient, he could only force a smile. "Yes."

Qi Hefeng asked again, "Friend, which sect are you from?"

The bitter melon-faced man replied, "No sect, no affiliation. I'm alone."

Qi Hefeng raised his brows and said, "To cultivate to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm alone, you must be quite talented. Interested in joining the Qi Family Stronghold?"

"Brother Qi flatters me. I'm used to being free and don't want to join any force for now."

"Alright," Qi Hefeng smiled and said no more, turning his attention to Yang Kai's movements.

The bitter melon-faced man frowned slightly, secretly glancing at Qi Hefeng. Seeing his expression was normal, as if he had just been making casual conversation, he finally relaxed.

At the cave entrance, Yang Kai stood alone, sword light sweeping, scattering the Yin-Soul ghosts.

Occasionally, a few Yin-Soul ghosts managed to slip past, but those guarding the rear swiftly intercepted and cut them down, ensuring none could break into the cave.

Everyone relaxed, no longer anxious as before.

As long as Yang Kai could hold on, this calamity could be overcome. The Emperor Realm was truly extraordinary, and many showed reverence. The only fear was that Yang Kai couldn't last much longer, for even the strongest have limits.

In fact, their worries soon came true.

Half a day later, it was obvious Yang Kai's attacks were no longer as sharp. Both his sword light and Divine Soul attacks had weakened, and more ghosts slipped through.

But it was understandable. For Yang Kai to hold out alone for half a day was proof of his strength. Before, even groups of four could only last the time it took to burn a stick of incense.

Another half day passed, and Yang Kai's sword hand trembled, his face pale—clearly nearing his limit.

Qi Hefeng stood up and said, "Sir, please fall back and rest for a while. Leave the rest to us."

"Yes, Sir. If you collapse, none of us will survive. You should rest first," others quickly echoed, urging him.

They weren't truly concerned for Yang Kai, but now he was the pillar here. Without him, their chances of survival were slim.

Hearing this, Yang Kai pondered for a moment, then nodded. "Alright."

He had held the line for a day, and the others had mostly recovered. Even if he retreated now, the rest could hold out for a while.

Just then, the howling wind outside the cave suddenly weakened—drastically.

Everyone was stunned, peering outside.

After a moment, someone said with a trembling voice, "The wind is almost over."

"Hahaha, the wind is almost over. This is great!"

"It's really almost gone. Heavens haven't abandoned us!"

Realizing the wind was ending, everyone shouted excitedly, as if they'd found a treasure, eager to share the news.

Even better, as the wind died down, the Yin-Soul ghosts seemed to receive some command and retreated into the strange mist. In the blink of an eye, the crisis that had trapped them at the cave entrance for over two days was resolved.

Everyone was overjoyed, crowding to the cave entrance, craning their necks to check if it was truly safe.

What they saw was the outside gale nearly gone, the weak wind no longer deadly, and not a single ghost in the mist.

The calamity had truly passed.

"Sir, be careful!" At that moment, Qi Hefeng suddenly shouted.

At the same time, a murky light burst from somewhere in the cave, shooting straight at Yang Kai's mind. In a flash, Yang Kai staggered, as if about to collapse.

The next moment, a figure lunged at Yang Kai from behind, striking fiercely at his forehead.

"How dare you!" Qi Hefeng roared, chasing after, but it happened so suddenly that he was a step too late, forced to watch helplessly as the unprepared Yang Kai was struck.

The others were also shocked, scattering and watching warily, not knowing what had happened.

Boom...

A muffled sound rang out as a palm struck Yang Kai's head. The attacker grinned viciously, and after succeeding, rushed out, not wanting to linger.

He knew that staying would only invite everyone to attack him, since Yang Kai had saved all their lives and was their benefactor.

When a benefactor is attacked, whether willing or not, everyone must at least pretend to catch the culprit.

As he left, he glanced at Zhang Ruoxi, his face full of smug satisfaction at his success.

But to his surprise, Zhang Ruoxi showed no panic at all, instead staring at him coldly, with no intention of stopping him.

What was going on? The man felt a sudden unease.

"You think you can leave after attacking me?" A chilling voice sounded behind him.

He quickly turned to see Yang Kai looking at him with mockery. The previously pale face was now ruddy, and his weak aura had become incomparably strong.

He showed no sign of weakness at all.

How was this possible?

Even if Yang Kai was in the Emperor Realm and had guarded the cave for a day, could he really be completely unspent? Or had he been hiding his strength all along, never showing his full power?

At this thought, the man's clothes were drenched in cold sweat.

Yang Kai reached out and grabbed his ankle. With a slight squeeze, the sound of bones breaking rang out.

"Ah!" The man screamed, trying to muster his strength to resist, but was horrified to find that under Yang Kai's grip, all his cultivation was sealed—he couldn't use any power at all.

Yang Kai casually tossed him back into the cave, slamming him into the wall, blood spilling everywhere.

"What's going on?"

"What is he doing?"

"What's happening?"

Only now did the other martial artists begin to react, but the scene before them left them confused. They had no idea why Yang Kai was fighting that martial artist.

Qi Hefeng said coldly, "This man harbored ill intent, attacking this Sir while he seemed weak. It's utterly despicable and unforgivable."

Everyone was shocked, staring at the martial artist lying on the ground.

It was the bitter melon-faced man Qi Hefeng had chatted with earlier.

Perhaps from the pain, the bitter melon face looked even more twisted, sweat pouring from his forehead.

"Truly vile! If not for this Sir, we'd all be dead here. Now that we've escaped, you not only show no gratitude, but even try to kill him. Do you have any conscience at all?"

"Such a despicable person deserves to have his soul extracted and refined. I know a bit about Divine Soul refining. Sir, if you wish, just say the word and I'll make sure he regrets ever being born."

"Heh, I know a bit too. Sir, if you need, I can help. I'll make sure he doesn't die for ten or fifteen days, but he'll wish he had."

Hearing this, the bitter melon-faced man turned as pale as snow, trembling all over.
