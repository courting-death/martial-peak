## Chapter 2567 — Ruoxi Has Grown Up

Half a day later, the group descended atop a mountain peak. The entire Wild Ancient Land was a vast expanse, densely packed with countless mountains, stretching endlessly, winding and coiling like dragons. It was the perfect place for the yao to hide themselves away.

This was where Yang Youwei’s cave residence was located.

According to him, with this place as the center, the ten surrounding peaks were all his territory.

Yang Kai took out the jade slip Pi San had given him earlier and compared it, finding that this location was still within the area recorded on the slip. However, it was marked with a crimson symbol, indicating a place of extreme danger.

It seemed the information in the jade slip wasn’t entirely useless. If ordinary cultivators saw the markings, they certainly wouldn’t dare venture here.

There was a cave halfway up the mountain, large enough for people to enter and exit. Inside, at the heart of the mountain, it opened into a hidden world, with many stone chambers carved out. Whether they were beautiful didn’t matter; the yao didn’t care about such things, only practicality.

Yang Youwei led Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi into the stone chambers, giving the best room to Yang Kai and the adjacent one to Zhang Ruoxi, then bowed and retreated.

With his life in their hands, he had no choice but to be respectful.

Inside the stone chamber, Yang Kai looked around and found that, though small, it had everything needed. It was clearly Yang Youwei’s own residence, with a stone bed and fine bedding, though who knew where he’d gotten it.

There was also a bath, seemingly fed by a mountain spring. The water was crystal clear, and when Yang Kai tested it, he found the temperature was just right.

“This yao actually knows how to enjoy life.” Yang Kai smiled and sat down at a stone stool.

“Sir, what should we do now?” Zhang Ruoxi followed beside him and asked.

“Since we’re here, let’s settle in.” Yang Kai sighed softly. He hadn’t expected such twists on this trip to the ancient land, but he couldn’t ignore the Third Disciple, and Xiaoxiao still needed to be found.

He and Xiaoxiao shared a spiritual connection, just as he’d sensed Liu Yan’s presence before. As long as they were within a certain range, they should be able to find each other.

Zhang Ruoxi naturally obeyed his every command, having no objections.

Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. The two exchanged a glance, and Yang Kai signaled Zhang Ruoxi, who then gracefully stepped outside.

Outside, Yang Youwei stood nervously, with two beautiful maids behind him, each carrying something—one a jug of spirit wine, the other a plate of spirit fruit. Their eyes were full of charm, their figures slender and curvy, draped in thin gauze that barely concealed their allure. Especially those two pairs of snow-white long legs exposed to the air, making one’s blood race.

These two maids were clearly not human, their bodies radiating strong Yao Qi. Who knew what demonic beast they’d transformed from, but since they could take human form, they’d obviously gained intelligence and learned to cultivate.

The two women were quite curious. They were originally Yang Youwei’s exclusive playthings, but this time he’d ordered them to serve an honored guest well. Yang Youwei had made it clear: whatever the guest wanted from them, they had to smile and comply, flattering him without the slightest resistance.

The two weren’t virgins, so they understood exactly what Yang Youwei was scheming. They didn’t mind—serving Yang Youwei or the guest was all the same. They just wondered if some powerful Yao Commander or Yao King had arrived. Otherwise, why would Yang Youwei let them personally go to please someone else?

The door opened. Yang Youwei looked up, about to call out “Sir,” but swallowed the words when he saw Zhang Ruoxi. “Miss, it’s you? Where’s the sir?”

Zhang Ruoxi eyed him warily, then glanced at the two provocatively dressed yao women behind him. Her pretty face instantly turned cold, especially as the two kept peeking through the door, trying to see what was inside, making her even more uncomfortable.

Turning back, she saw Yang Kai was also curiously watching, his eyes roaming over the two yao women.

With a flick of her hand, the door slammed shut, blocking the shameless gaze of the two yao women, leaving them looking aggrieved.

“Sir is tired and resting. What is it?” Zhang Ruoxi showed Yang Youwei no kindness.

Yang Youwei chuckled, bowing. “It’s like this: Sir is new here, and there’s not much to offer in these wild mountains. I’ve brought a jug of spirit wine and a plate of spirit fruit as a token of goodwill. Please don’t take offense!”

Zhang Ruoxi’s gaze finally shifted to the wine and fruit, and she snorted lightly.

Yang Youwei didn’t know what she meant, waiting for her to step aside, but Zhang Ruoxi stood like a guardian at the door, not moving at all. Helpless, he signaled the two yao women to hand the items to her.

“Anything else?” Zhang Ruoxi took the items and, seeing they hadn’t left, asked impatiently.

Yang Youwei grinned obsequiously. “Sir must be tired from the journey. I’ve prepared two servants to help him bathe and rest… Miss, could you perhaps…”

Before he finished, Zhang Ruoxi pointed back the way they’d come.

Yang Youwei turned, but saw nothing, scratching his head in confusion.

“You don’t need to bother. I’ll attend to Sir myself. Wherever you came from, go back there—and if you dare disturb Sir’s cultivation again for anything other than news about that madwoman, I’ll make you regret it!” Zhang Ruoxi’s eyes turned icy cold, her face full of murderous intent.

Yang Youwei was startled, not knowing how he’d offended this lady, but he dared not act out. After all, Zhang Ruoxi was brought by Yang Kai, and offending her would surely end badly.

He repeatedly apologized, then left with the two yao women, who had come excited but left disappointed, looking quite aggrieved.

“Shameless vixens!” Zhang Ruoxi cursed, holding the wine and fruit.

Two seductive vixens, already discarded by another, actually had the nerve to set their sights on Sir—how infuriating! What made her even angrier was that Sir himself had just been staring at them, eyes shining with curiosity, openly sizing them up as if he’d never seen anything like it before.

Turning around, Zhang Ruoxi, full of anger, was about to enter when her raised foot froze in midair.

She suddenly remembered, after so many years following Sir, she’d never seen him get close to any woman. She wasn’t a child anymore and understood the ways of men and women. When she lived with Sister Hua in the Small Xuan Realm, Sister Hua often teased her about such things, making her blush.

She knew well that, with Sir’s current cultivation and strength, if he wanted women, countless beauties would be at his disposal. Yet he seemed never to have such thoughts, always forging ahead, cultivating hard, never relaxing.

What man doesn’t like women? Why was Sir so disciplined?

She suddenly felt guilty, thinking she shouldn’t have sent the two yao women away. After all, judging by Sir’s gaze, he seemed quite interested in them, but she’d acted on her own and dismissed them.

Feeling uneasy, Zhang Ruoxi entered, placed the wine and fruit on the table, and recounted what had happened, carefully watching Yang Kai’s expression.

Yang Kai just responded with a simple “Mm,” and nothing more.

Was Sir angry because she ruined his fun? Why was his reaction so calm? Zhang Ruoxi suddenly felt anxious; some things couldn’t be guessed at, and once she started, it was hard to stop.

After a long silence, Zhang Ruoxi bit her lip and said, “Sir, you’ve worked so hard for so long. Should I call those two yao women back to serve you and help you rest?”

After saying this, Zhang Ruoxi’s cheeks reddened, feeling nervous, afraid Yang Kai would agree right away.

Yang Kai sniffed the aroma of the spirit wine and replied without looking up, “No need.”

He’d been curious about what kind of demonic beast those two yao women had transformed from, to be so alluring. They’d be a disaster outside, but he had no other intentions. As he spoke, he poured himself a cup of spirit wine to taste.

“Then… what if Ruoxi served you herself?”

“Pfft…” Yang Kai spat out the wine, hurriedly wiping himself.

This made Zhang Ruoxi laugh, and she stepped forward, rolling up her sleeves to help Yang Kai wipe his wet clothes, her movements gentle.

The scent of a maiden wafted over. Yang Kai stared at her beautiful face so close, smiled, and said, “Ruoxi has grown up.”

He still remembered when he’d brought Zhang Ruoxi out of the Zhang Family. The little girl hadn’t grown up yet, but after so long by his side, she’d become a great beauty. Maybe it was because he’d overlooked her, but only now did he realize it.

Zhang Ruoxi paused at his words, her cheeks flushing.

Yang Kai patted her shoulder, motioning for her to stand. Only then did he rise, shaking the wine from his clothes, and said with a smile, “If you ever take a liking to a man, just tell me. I’ll see to it that he marries you in grand style.”

Zhang Ruoxi pressed her lips together, saying nothing, her eyes tinged with bitterness.

“All right, there shouldn’t be anything else for now. Go cultivate on your own. If I need you, I’ll call for you,” Yang Kai waved his hand.

Zhang Ruoxi opened her mouth, as if wanting to say something, but finally just replied, “Yes!”

She left, closed the door, and entered the adjacent stone chamber, finally covering her cheeks with her hands, feeling the burning heat and the pounding in her chest like war drums.

She didn’t know what was wrong with her today. Suddenly, she’d spoken words she’d never dared say before. Now, thinking back, she couldn’t understand where her courage had come from.

She had a vague feeling that if she didn’t say these things now, she might never get another chance.

Had she reached the stage Sister Hua had mentioned—“a young girl’s budding feelings”?
