## Chapter 1949 — Summons

After realizing the gap between himself and Yang Kai, Chu Fei no longer carried the same arrogant air he once had, but with so many eyes on him he was unwilling to lose face; otherwise how could he hold his head high later in the Biyu Sect?

So even though fear gripped him, he could only force himself to keep up a hard front and throw the problem back at Yang Kai.

"It's simple." Yang Kai said with a smile as he looked at Chu Fei and raised a finger. "Senior Brother, with you making such a fuss, I probably won't be able to continue refining pills here; shouldn't you compensate for the losses?"

Chu Fei's eyes nearly bulged—he had never expected Yang Kai to be so mercenary.

Yang Kai chuckled, "Junior Brother, don't be stingy—just give me a few hundred thousand Source Crystals and that'll do."

"A few hundred thousand... you're dreaming!" Chu Fei jumped to his feet, his face twisted. "You really dare to make such an outrageous demand!"

A few hundred thousand Source Crystals was a sum Chu Fei didn't even dare imagine; counting what he'd spent and what he now had, he only possessed around one hundred to two hundred thousand, and Yang Kai's demand was effectively asking for his life.

Yang Kai's expression turned cold in an instant and he snarled, "Senior Brother shows no sincerity at all; it seems we cannot continue this conversation. In that case..."

Before he finished speaking, he suddenly tilted his head as if he had sensed something and listened intently.

Seeing this, Chu Fei's face brightened and he laughed, "Junior Brother, today's matter ends here. Senior Brother will remember you—our paths will cross again."

Seeing Yang Kai's expression, Chu Fei immediately realized a high-ranking expert was transmitting to him; with a sect's master intervening, he felt himself safe.

With that he waved his hand and shouted to the other two, "Let's go!"

Those two dared not delay; they hurriedly lifted the still-struggling Junior Brother Jiang and prepared to leave at once.

"You insult my reputation and think you can walk away?" Yang Kai's cold snort rang out. Chu Fei was startled and turned to see Yang Kai before him, a fist blazing with iridescent light already enlarging again.

A dense Domain Field swirled around Chu Fei, utterly suppressing him; he only managed a startled cry before Yang Kai pinned him to the ground and unleashed a fierce barrage of blows.

A Third Stage of the Void King Realm was by no means weak. Even if Chu Fei's internal strength had not been fully converted into Origin Qi, if he fought to the death he still had a chance.

But the prior clash with Yang Kai had shown Chu Fei he was no match, so this time he had no thought of resisting; instead he merely mobilized defensive power to protect his vital points and let Yang Kai's fists fall like raindrops.

The gathered martial artists were utterly dumbstruck.

A series of dull thuds sounded, occasionally pierced by Chu Fei's miserable howls.

When Yang Kai rose, Chu Fei lay on the ground covered in blood and moaning—clearly badly injured.

Yang Kai glanced in a direction, cursed under his breath, then called to Liu Qianyun, "Pack up!"

Liu Qianyun froze for a moment, recovered, and hurried after Yang Kai toward their lodgings.

Wherever they passed, Biyu Sect disciples made way, their looks toward Yang Kai full of fear.

...

Liu Qianyun followed behind Yang Kai, staring blankly at his broad back, her thoughts wandering.

She had never expected that Yang Kai, who usually seemed so calm, could turn so ruthless when provoked; in that crowded market, had he not restrained himself out of regard for their sect ties, Chu Fei would very likely have been beaten to death by him.

But with this, they probably truly could no longer go to the market to refine pills, which made Liu Qianyun somewhat regretful—after all, they had earned a fair amount of Source Crystals over the past month.

Walking along, Yang Kai suddenly stopped; Liu Qianyun nearly bumped into his back and hurriedly halted, asking, "Brother Yang, what's wrong?"

"You go back first, I need to go up to the peak," Yang Kai replied.

"The peak?" Liu Qianyun frowned, then realized, "Protector Bian wants to see you? Then the one who transmitted to you earlier was..."

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded. "It's nothing—don't worry."

"Do you want me to go with you?" Liu Qianyun asked.

"Protector Bian didn't summon you; you probably can't go up. You should go back," Yang Kai said, then strode toward the peak.

Liu Qianyun called after him from behind, "Be careful."

Yang Kai did not reply, only waving his hand.

Halfway up the slope a figure appeared and looked at Yang Kai coldly, the expression on his face tinged with displeasure.

"Senior Brother Kou!" Yang Kai greeted coolly and cupped his fist.

The man blocking his path was Kou Wu, who had been the one to transmit to him earlier and had ordered him to ascend the peak to meet Protector Bian.

"You're bold to defy my orders—didn't I tell you to let Chu Fei go? Why did you hit him?" Kou Wu snorted coldly.

Yang Kai sneered, "Being bullied all the way and swallowing it? Is Bian Protector's line that weak? If so, Senior Brother Kou, I'm disappointed."

"How long have you been in the sect? What do you know? Do you think today's matter is just Chu Fei coming to stir trouble?" Kou Wu's face was stern.

"I know full well it was a set up," Yang Kai sneered. "I was only there refining pills to earn a few Source Crystals — how did that harm anyone's profits? Let me guess, this is Protector Zhu's doing? And Protector Bian doesn't want to pick a fight with Protector Zhu, so I'm supposed to swallow my pride and put up with it?"

Kou Wu looked somewhat surprised and nodded. "You're not entirely stupid! Indeed, although Chu Fei wasn't directly ordered by Protector Zhu, it did concern Protector Zhu's interests. You can refine where you like—why not enter Baoyuan Hall? You should know Baoyuan Hall is the Pill Hall our line set up in the market; if you refined there, we could shelter you and you wouldn't have people coming to cause trouble at your door."

Yang Kai spread his hands, "I'm poor—if I went into Baoyuan Hall, I'd have to give away sixty percent of my earnings, and you know I just arrived in the Star Realm and don't have Source Crystals to spare."

"That excuse will do," Kou Wu admitted, unwilling to press the matter further. "But today you beat Chu Fei and gave Protector Zhu's line an excuse to pick a quarrel. If they insist on disciplining you under sect rules—Chu Fei is your senior; what you did is insubordination."

Yang Kai gave a sly chuckle. “Didn’t Protector Bian call me over precisely for this matter? I trust that esteemed Senior will handle it properly.”

Kou Wu’s face instantly darkened as he hurried to warn, “Whatever you do, don’t use the words ‘esteemed Senior’ in front of Protector, or you can kiss your dog life goodbye!”

"I understand—women, huh!" Yang Kai said with an air of having caught on.

"Enough. Come with me. I hope Protector Bian is in a good mood today—if not... you'll be unlucky." Kou Wu shook his head and led Yang Kai toward the peak.

They entered the same palace as before; Kou Wu led Yang Kai into a side chamber.

The chamber's air was thick with cloying sweetness, and pink furnishings everywhere made it look like a woman's boudoir.

Bian Yuqing was lazily reclining on a chaise, her exquisite curves evident; she propped her cheek with one hand and kept her eyes closed as if dozing, her posture coy and suggestive.

The chaise was draped with a precious beast-skin rug, and beside her several scantily clad young women clustered—some fanning her, some peeling spirit-fruit like grapes and feeding pieces to her lips, others kneeling to gently knead her long, straight, beautiful legs...

The first thought that popped into Yang Kai's head upon entering was decadence.

Kou Wu, as ever, kept his head bowed and stared at his toes, cupping his fists. "Protector Bian, the boy has been brought."

"Junior greets Protector!" Yang Kai did not lower his gaze like Kou Wu, but his look was clear and free of desire.

He knew a woman like Bian Yuqing was far beyond his reach; even a flicker of improper thought would earn him a harsh reprimand.

Hearing Yang Kai, the resting Bian Yuqing opened her eyes slightly; the sharpness in her phoenix-like gaze swept over him and made him uneasy, as if his skin were being cut by a blade.

When their eyes met Yang Kai felt her pupils like a bottomless whirlpool, trying to pull his soul in to drown it forever.

Startled, Yang Kai bit his tongue; the pain snapped him back to clarity.

When he looked again, Bian Yuqing's eyes were calm and still, restored to their normal state.

“Little brat, you’re quite bold. You’ve only been in the Sect a few days, yet you already dare cause trouble for this Lord!” Bian Yuqing’s voice was sweet and velvety, but her tone was far from pleased.

“Protector, please judge clearly,” Yang Kai said, forcing himself to withstand that suffocating pressure. “This disciple did not stir up trouble—he was bullied and merely rose to resist.”

"Rose to resist? Ha. I hear you beat your Senior into a wreck—he'll need at least three months to recover; is that what you call fighting back?" Bian Yuqing surveyed Yang Kai coolly.

"Perhaps I struck a bit hard, but only by doing so could others learn not to underestimate Protector Bian's line. If I had held back they would think our line weak and easy to bully!"

Bian Yuqing raised an eyebrow and smiled, "By your account, should I gather all the disciples and publicly praise you as an example?"

"I was merely doing my duty, Protector—you flatter me!" Yang Kai replied.

"Impudent!" Bian Yuqing scolded coquettishly and with a wave sent a mighty force that hurled Yang Kai into the wall.

"Protector, calm down!" Kou Wu hurriedly tried to appease her.

Unexpectedly, after her outburst Bian Yuqing giggled, leaving Kou Wu momentarily stunned and unsure of her true mood.
