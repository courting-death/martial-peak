## Chapter 1295 — Corpse Den

The more concealed the sealing formation, the more it confirmed Yang Kai's earlier suspicions.

Staring at the formation for a long moment, Yang Kai's expression suddenly shifted; he summoned the Void King-Grade refining furnace into his hand, pointed, and said in a low voice, "Go in and take a look!"

With a soft trill, the Fire Bird Artifact Spirit flew out of the refining furnace and, without hesitation, dove headfirst into the sealing formation. The moment the Artifact Spirit touched the formation, the surrounding space rocked, and then the spirit's trace vanished without a trace.

Yang Kai frowned, and when he felt that his link with the Artifact Spirit still remained, he relaxed.

Standing in place and carefully receiving the information the Artifact Spirit transmitted from within, Yang Kai's face shifted through several expressions; after a long moment he said, "Looks like this is the place. There's another world inside, and the Spiritual Qi is astonishingly strong—very likely the place we've been searching for."

"Really?" Yang Yan cried out with joy.

"However… there is also a lot of Corpse Qi inside. It seems more than one Corpse Soldier lives here." Yang Kai's face darkened.

Yang Yan froze and grew hesitant. If there had been only that lone Corpse Soldier, Yang Kai's methods would have sufficed and there was nothing to fear; but if there were too many, Yang Kai could not contend with them. Whether to press on required careful thought.

After a while Yang Yan said, "Since this is the remnants of the Guyang Sect, it means these Corpse Soldiers appeared after Guyang Sect was exterminated. It's very possible many of them were once Guyang Sect disciples who, by some chance, after death became like this. That means at best they're just corpse generals cultivated for two thousand years—at most equivalent to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, perhaps even a little weaker."

"Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, huh." Yang Kai's eyes showed thought as he murmured.

If that were all, then there was nothing to fear; while he might not be able to defeat every such corpse general in direct combat, escaping with Yang Yan would be no problem.

After thinking for a moment, Yang Kai made his decision and nodded slightly. "Then let's go in."

If he had only sensed Corpse Qi, Yang Kai would have turned and left. Though he did not fear those thousand-year corpse generals, needless fights were to be avoided when possible—yet besides the Corpse Qi, the world's Spiritual Qi inside was exceptionally dense, clearly hiding something valuable.

The two of them had come this far together. Now that their goal was within reach, they naturally did not want to back down at the last moment.

Saying so, he dispersed his Saint Yuan, wrapping Yang Yan along with him, and led her forward a step.

The ground spun beneath his foot. In an instant the scene before them had changed—the two found themselves standing inside a place like a cavern, with a mournful wind howling from a distant corner, sounding like ghostly wails that sent chills down the spine.

The cavern walls were covered with an unknown, phosphorescent substance, a sickly green glow like ghost-fire.

Yet within the cavern, the Spiritual Qi was concentrated to an extraordinary degree. Yang Kai even smelled a faint medicinal fragrance and his heart jolted—he knew he and Yang Yan had truly found the right place; the location indicated by those two half-maps were almost certainly this secret cave of the Guyang Sect.

The cavern was dim, but with Yang Kai's cultivation, after pouring Saint Yuan into his eyes everything before him became clear. Quietly releasing his Divine Sense to probe, Yang Kai quickly realized the cavern bore semi-artificial marks; it seemed an existing cavern a hundred zhang below ground had been further worked and expanded.

Far deeper in the cavern there were passages running in all directions, each leading to unknown places. Yang Kai followed a thread of Divine Sense deeper and deeper; only after tracing thirty li did his face change and expression turn horrified.

"Found something?" Yang Yan whispered.

"Shh!" Yang Kai immediately put up a finger, then quietly withdrew that strand of Divine Sense and sent his voice to Yang Yan: "Corpse Soldiers—many, many Corpse Soldiers."

Yang Yan's face drained of color.

Yang Kai added, "But they all seem to be sleeping, not awakened. If we are careful and don't disturb them, it should be fine."

"How many?" Yang Yan asked, face pale, voice strained.

"Not sure. In the passage I scouted there were seven or eight at the bottom; there are at least hundreds of passages here. If each passage looks like that, then—"

"Could this be a Corpse Den!" Yang Yan seemed to recall something and exclaimed.

"A Corpse Den?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Yes. It's said some special places are prone to generating Corpse Soldiers, and if those Corpse Soldiers sleep and cultivate there they can easily fuse soul and body and awaken intelligence. If this truly is a Corpse Den, it's extremely dangerous."

"Whether it's a Corpse Den I don't know, but the Corpse Qi deep in those passages is indeed very dense, and the chilling yin air is vigorous. Those sleeping Corpse Soldiers are clearly inhaling that cold white vapor to strengthen themselves."

"Then it must be a Corpse Den." Yang Yan flinched and muttered: "With so many Corpse Soldiers, some were likely former Guyang Sect disciples, while others were martial artists who perished here later. We've probably walked into something serious."

"We're already here, why worry about that now." Yang Kai chuckled, and with a thought a distant ball of flame silently flew back and then dove into his body—his probing Artifact Spirit returning.

Seeing this, Yang Yan gritted her teeth and once more activated the power of her Secret Treasure necklace. The flowing light it gave off wrapped not only her but Yang Kai as well.

In an instant, the two of their auras were sealed off.

They exchanged a glance and then quietly moved forward.

Since those Corpse Soldiers were asleep, they were not an immediate threat. Yang Kai's only worry was the Saint King-Grade peak-level Corpse Soldier he had wounded earlier—he didn't know where that one was hiding. He had not dared to probe recklessly, so for the moment couldn't find its trace.

Passing by some deep side passages, they could faintly sense the dense Corpse Qi and the sounds of inhalation and exhalation deep within; but those sounds were regular—clearly, without outside interference those Corpse Soldiers could not awaken in a short time.

Every time they passed such a passage, Yang Yan instinctively edged closer to Yang Kai, as if seeking some safety.

Fortunately, Yang Yan's Secret Treasure performed excellently and the two were well guarded, so their deeper incursion did not reveal a trace of their presence.

Meanwhile, in a dim cavern down a certain side passage, three gaunt, terrifying Corpse Soldiers sat cross-legged. Whatever cultivation method they practiced, with every breath they inhaled the surrounding white vapor into their chests to strengthen themselves.

Each of those three exuded the energy aura of a peak Saint King Realm.

A shadow flashed at the mouth of the passage as another Corpse Soldier stumbled in—ragged, with an arm severed at the elbow and fangs bared, looking hideous.

The moment he appeared the three others noticed him and opened their eyes; in an instant, the cavern's dimness was punctuated by six jade-green, ghost-fire eyes flickering to life.

"Eh—Brother Nie, how did you end up like this?" one of the Corpse Soldiers looked at his companion's severed arm and asked in surprise. "Did you run into some danger outside?"

The one with the severed arm flashed a brutal light in his eyes and ground his teeth. "Indeed I ran into danger and carelessly lost an arm!"

"Really?" The Corpse Soldier who had spoken earlier was greatly astonished. "Since many years ago, haven't there been no Origin Returning Realm martial artists entering Zangxiong Valley? Could another of those Origin Returning Realm martial artists have come?"

"Not Origin Returning Realm—just a Saint King of the Second Stage." The severed-arm Corpse Soldier seemed ashamed. "I was careless and suffered this grievous wound."

"Heh, Brother Nie, you're joking. If we still had human bodies such an injury would indeed be hard to heal, but now we're like this, such a wound is trivial; a little of our Corpse Qi and it can be mended."

"Brother Nie's wound probably won't fully recover." Another Corpse Soldier with long hair spoke as if having noticed something; her voice was mellifluous and pleasant—indeed she was of a female body. Though her full appearance was unclear, one could imagine she had been a beauty in life.

"What do you mean?" the first Corpse Soldier asked, puzzled.

"If I'm not mistaken, isn't there a portion missing from Brother Nie's severed arm?" the female Corpse Soldier's eyes flashed.

At her words the other two examined the arm closely and indeed discovered it was true: the severed arm he had brought back was missing a piece, and the cut was unnaturally neat, as if it had been cut twice.

"Could a mere Second Stage Saint King be so formidable? Brother Nie, did you underestimate him?" the female Corpse Soldier chided.

"It's not that I underestimated him; his power was too strange. I've never encountered such an attack before." The severed-arm Corpse Soldier recalled the pitch-black, blade-like strike; even as a corpse his face twitched with lingering fear. If he hadn't reacted quickly, he might have died again. After his first death he had been brought back by the other Corpse Soldiers and spent centuries in the Corpse Den to cultivate; after countless years he had regained consciousness and slowly reached his present strength. If he died again now, he would truly be gone.

"What kind of power was that?" the other three Corpse Soldiers asked in alarm, pressing for details.
