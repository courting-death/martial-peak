## Chapter 1683 — Who Do You Think You Are?

“When have I ever been afraid?” Tang Fushui snapped back, his expression dark and his tone defiant.

A soft, tinkling laugh sounded. Standing beside Old Woman Feng and supporting her, Feng Yan swayed with graceful poise, gave Yang Kai a ladylike bow, her bright eyes shifting as she parted her crimson lips and said, “Junior Sister pays respects to Senior Brother Yang. Senior Brother, please stay calm — you have been away from Lingxiao Sect for a long time and are not familiar with matters here, so there may be some misunderstandings. Right now the Corpse Spirit Sect is bringing disaster upon Dark Star; we all fled here to Lingxiao Sect seeking refuge. As leader of Lingxiao Sect, Senior Brother Yang is the host here — please consider the bigger picture. If agreeable, why don't we sit down and have a proper discussion?”

Old Woman Feng gave a faint nod, clearly thinking her legitimate granddaughter had spoken with perfect tact.

Even Tang Fushui, briefly flustered, looked a shade less sullen.

“Who do you think you are? Whose junior sister are you? Don't try to cozy up to this Sect Master!” Yang Kai glanced at her coldly, utterly dismissive.

Old Woman Feng's expression darkened.

Feng Yan's face bloomed with furious indignation; her silver teeth clenched and her small fists curled.

She came from Myriad Beasts Mountain and was no weakling; as Old Woman Feng's legitimate granddaughter she possessed excellent aptitude. Though she had not been as famous as people like Wei Guchang, she was one of Dark Star's rising stars.

Coupled with her flower-like beauty and keen mind, she had always been the object of pursuit among the young men of Myriad Beasts Mountain, regarded as a goddess in their hearts.

Young men from other sects would inevitably trail after her when they saw her.

She had seen too many men fall for her looks!

Thus she never took men seriously, viewing them as fools she could toy with at will.

But Yang Kai's reaction enraged and shamed her; from childhood till now she had never suffered such an insult — it was as if her warm face had been pressed against someone's cold backside in public, leaving her utterly humiliated.

Just as she opened her mouth to retort, Yang Kai stopped paying her the slightest attention.

To Yang Kai she was an utterly insignificant pawn.

This infuriated Feng Yan further; hate and fury shot from her beautiful eyes as she glared at Yang Kai as though she wanted to tear a chunk of flesh from him.

“I’ll give you one cup of tea’s time. Send someone out to make things clear. If this Sect Master still doesn’t have an answer by then—every last one of you can get the hell out of Lingxiao Sect!” Yang Kai’s hawk-like gaze swept coldly across the crowd as he barked the order.

The assembly erupted. Those who had been averting their eyes and dared not meet Yang Kai's gaze now flushed with anger and glared at him ominously.

The stronger figures who had already harbored hostility toward Yang Kai now had murderous intent plainly showing in their eyes.

Yang Kai snorted; he stood like a spear planted in the ground, facing the storm of complex looks and emotions as if in the eye of a raging whirlpool, unmoved.

What a joke — Yang Kai had once fought someone like Luo Hai, a Second-Stage Void King Realm Star Lord–level expert. How could he possibly fear the likes of these people?

Though the group before him were all Origin Returning Realm and very numerous, if Yang Kai truly decided to kill, he suspected none of them could escape Lingxiao Sect.

Those vicious glares of theirs were as pointless as a courtesan throwing flirtatious looks at a blind man.

After delivering his ultimatum he stopped addressing them and instead spread his Divine Sense to seek Lingxiao Sect's people, but his search through the eighty-one peaks yielded not a single clue.

The original people of Lingxiao Sect had all vanished.

This discovery made Yang Kai's face grow increasingly grim.

He could now vaguely guess what had happened to Lingxiao Sect.

One possibility was that they had all been slaughtered by these people, which would explain why he could find none of them.

The second possibility was that they had already withdrawn from the eighty-one peaks — and as for where they went, Yang Kai could more or less guess.

The first possibility was unlikely. Though the Lingxiao Sect hadn’t had many members at the start and their strengths varied greatly, ever since taking in the people from Star Emperor Mountain, even if their numbers were still limited, they were far from being some soft persimmon that others could squeeze at will.

With only the people before him, wiping out Ye Xijun and the others seemed unrealistic.

That left the second possibility: Ye Xijun may have led Lingxiao Sect's people to the deepest reaches of the Flowing Flame Sandland! That was Yang Yan's place of slumber, guarded by the Three Flames Ring, into which no one could enter!

Yang Kai did not know why Ye Xijun would make such a choice, but it must have been for a good reason.

Just as he spread his Divine Sense and his thoughts shifted, an elder of ethereal mien suddenly stepped forward through the crowd and, in a grave tone, cupped his fist and said, “Sect Master Yang, I am Li Jianming, Great Elder of Medicine Pill Sect. Sect Master Yang has come a long way; please take a rest first and then we can discuss this matter.”

Medicine Pill Sect! That sect had considerable renown on Dark Star because its disciples were adept at pill refinement. Much like the Yao Wang Valley of old in Zhongdu, Medicine Pill Sect held a special status on Dark Star.

Medicine Pill Sect had five elders, all Origin-Grade Lower-Level pill refiners — exceptionally valuable talents on Dark Star. Even the Battle Sky Alliance and Leitai Sect would show them deep respect.

As Great Elder, Li Jianming was a famed figure on Dark Star, ranking with the masters of major powers.

He naturally had the right to step forward and speak.

The old man smoothed his graying beard and smiled at Yang Kai, as if asking for a favor of face.

Yang Kai cast him a cool glance and said, his voice like ice,
“Half a cup of tea's time left. If you want to test my patience, I don’t mind. But once that time’s up—don’t expect me to hold back.”

With that, Yang Kai bared his teeth in a grin, revealing a mouthful of sharp, white fangs—like a predator ready to strike.

Li Jianming's face changed and he snorted angrily, “Sect Master Yang, aren’t you being a bit unreasonable? We came to greet you. If you won’t show us any courtesy, fine, but to speak so callously, ignoring the greater good of our race—aren’t you afraid you’ll bring disaster upon yourself?”

Yang Kai's gaze turned ice-cold, blade-like, and fixed on Li Jianming.

The old man, though an Origin-Grade pill refiner, did not have particularly high cultivation — only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — and visibly could not hold Yang Kai's stare; he stepped back two paces.

Fortunately Yang Kai did not intend to kill him without asking, or Li Jianming would have been grievously harmed.

“How dare you!” Tang Fushui suddenly shouted, eyes flashing with ferocity. “How dare you lay hands on Elder Li! You are utterly disrespectful. As a Sect Master you act on personal whims — fine; I will teach you a lesson so you learn how to behave!”

Tang Fushui spoke and his Saint Yuan suddenly burst forth.

His Saint Yuan was fire in nature; when he channeled it his whole body flared like a blazing orb, terrifying in momentum.

He merely reached out and clenched, and from the void a gigantic flaming hammer materialized and smashed toward Yang Kai.

Any Origin Returning Realm would have great difficulty dealing with such a fiery giant hammer — this was the full-force strike of the Hall Master of Piaomiao Hall.

Even Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi, and Lin Yurao, who had stood silently behind Yang Kai, showed grave expressions; Yang Xiuzhu stepped forward to act.

Yang Kai put out a hand to stop him and laughed, “Fine, fine — finally someone couldn't restrain themselves. Since you're courting death, don't blame this Sect Master!”

With that he leapt up where he stood, his visage savage as he rushed toward the flaming giant hammer.

He had returned to the Lingxiao Sect full of anticipation, only to find that the sect he had built with his own hands had been taken over by a group of complete outsiders—his own disciples and friends were nowhere to be found.

Yang Kai had long been boiling with anger.

But before he understood what had happened, he could only suppress his fury and parley with these people in words.

Though unlikely, perhaps there was some misunderstanding?

How naive — his kindness mistaken for weakness, and some were foolish enough to invite their own deaths!

Yang Kai's wrath finally exploded.

“Courting death!” Tang Fushui sneered when he saw Yang Kai meet the attack bare-handed. He increased the output of his Saint Yuan rather than holding back.

Instantly the flaming hammer expanded another circle and grew ever more formidable.

Countless people’s eyelids twitched as they watched Yang Kai strike into the hammer, their thoughts scattered.

The tiny figure collided with the massive hammer; the next moment Tang Fushui's face changed wildly as he was flung backward as if struck by an enormous force.

Rumble...

That giant hammer — forged from the pure Saint Yuan of a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert and condensed by secret arts — shattered in midair into countless fragments, fiery shards scattering.

Yang Kai sprang out from within the debris, his figure imbued with killing intent and unleashed fury that seemed almost tangible as he shot to Tang Fushui's front like a streak of light.

In stunned disbelief Tang Fushui watched Yang Kai swing a single fist down hard.

Tang Fushui reacted fast; he desperately drove Saint Yuan to form external defenses and expanded his aura to escape.

But the moment his aura surged out, it was shattered inch by inch as if meeting its natural nemesis. His entire body froze in place, the air around him solidifying—he couldn’t even move a finger.

Yang Kai's fist grew vast before his eyes.

There was no ripple of Saint Yuan, yet the punch carried an aura of death — before it landed Tang Fushui felt his protective Saint Yuan begin to break and his face sting.

“No!” Tang Fushui screamed in terror. All traces of a Hall Master’s dignity were gone—his face was deathly pale, his eyes filled with panic, and all he wanted now was to cling to life.

Boom...

Yang Kai's punch struck his face.
