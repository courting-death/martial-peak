## Chapter 1369 — Sending an Invitation

"Heh heh, although the Haixin Sect is far away in the Wuyou Sea and quite distant from here, they are by no means weak — I've heard plenty about them. A red-haired one from the Haixin Sect like this must be none other than Brother Cui." The warrior blocking the Haixin Sect's ranks explained with an air of nonchalance.

The red-haired elder's expression cleared a little at the flattery, but he did not relax his guard and asked, "Who are you?"

"My surname is Xie!" the man revealed with an inscrutable smile.

"Xie? What has that to do with me?" The red-haired elder frowned.

The man surnamed Xie frowned in turn, appearing somewhat surprised. After a moment's thought he probed, "Brother Cui, how many days have you been traveling here?"

"Only three days, but what business is that of yours?" The red-haired elder was puzzled by the other's words; the man neither stated his purpose nor revealed his identity — most suspicious — and then began asking random questions, which tested his patience.

"I see. Perhaps Brother Cui hasn't fully investigated the situation around Tianyun City yet?" The man surnamed Xie seemed to know more than he let on and smiled faintly.

The red-haired elder snorted coldly: "So? Speak plainly — don't beat around the bush!"

The man surnamed Xie chuckled: "Don't take offense, Brother Cui. If that's the case, it's not hard to explain why your sect's disciples would go to Dragon Lair Mountain to 'pluck the tiger's whisker.'"

"Pluck the tiger's whisker?" The red-haired elder's eyes narrowed. "That little hill? They dare?"

The man surnamed Xie said lightly, "If I tell you that the owner of that little hill has a good relationship with Elder Qian Tong, and there are even rumors he has some ties to City Lord Fei Zhi Tu, and that a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator died at his hand — would Brother Cui still disdain him so?"

"What?" The red-haired elder's face instantly darkened. His expression flickered as he barked, "Is that true?"

"I have no reason to lie to you."

"Even so, what of it? Killing an Elite Disciple of my sect — he must pay in blood!" The red-haired elder roared, fierce on the surface yet inwardly tense. Although the information made him wary, the matter at hand was grave; he could not help but scheme for vengeance.

If he did nothing, he wouldn't even be able to return to the Haixin Sect.

"Ha! That's the very thing I wanted to hear." The man surnamed Xie laughed aloud, a cruel glint flashing in his eyes as he lowered his voice, "Not to hide it from Brother Cui — the Origin Returning Realm cultivator killed by that little hill's owner was an elder of my Xie Family. My Xie Family and that brat are sworn enemies!"

"Oh?" The red-haired elder appeared surprised, then as if recalling something he sized up the warrior blocking their way and hesitated, "Yingyue Hall has a deacon named Xie Li — are you..."

"Xie Li is indeed my cousin!" the man surnamed Xie smiled faintly.

Hearing this, the red-haired elder's face lit up with joy. He dared not be proud and courteously clasped his fists, "So it's Brother Xie. I was remiss."

"No matter, no matter!" the man surnamed Xie waved his hand casually and warmly said, "No harm in ignorance. Brother Cui, you have disciples stationed nearby to watch the Imperial Garden's movements, correct? If you don't mind, why not stay at the Xie Family for a few days? My Xie Family may not be large, but we can spare a fine villa and a few wing rooms."

"That would be most welcome. I hope it won't trouble your family." The red-haired elder brightened — he had been worried about where to lodge, but now had an invitation. From the other's earlier words it seemed he had a deep grudge with the owner of that little hill; immediately they felt a common cause and, without a second thought, accepted. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Though the red-haired elder suspected the man might be seeking to borrow strength, he cared little.

"Brother Cui flatters us. Your sect coming to the Xie Family would honor this humble place. Please, this way — let's walk and talk. I have long yearned for the Wuyou Sea but never had the chance to go," the man surnamed Xie invited.

"Please." The red-haired elder returned the politeness, and the two of them led a dozen Haixin Sect disciples toward the Xie Family's main hall.

The man surnamed Xie was loquacious, rattling off tales of strange people and affairs along the road and artfully expressing his longing for the Wuyou Sea, which instantly made the red-haired elder feel utterly at home.

After a while the red-haired elder began to inquire about Yang Kai. When he learned that Yang Kai's backer was indeed Qian Tong, his expression changed slightly — if that were true, avenging the grievance would be no easy task.

Moreover, the Xie Family lay within the sphere of influence of Yingyue Hall; such open hostility toward Dragon Lair Mountain — would that not cause trouble?

Seeming to sense his worries, the man surnamed Xie immediately told him that Yingyue Hall would not intervene in the feud between the Xie Family and Dragon Lair Mountain. This news made the red-haired elder overjoyed; he felt increasingly certain his decision to go to the Xie Family was right. With Yingyue Hall staying out of it, and the Xie Family's strength combined with his own, toppling a little hill would be child's play.

At that thought the red-haired elder's face turned ferocious, as if he could already see Yang Kai torn limb from limb.

......

Inside Dragon Lair Mountain, in a fairly large pavilion, Yang Kai received Wei Guchang and the others. The host and guests took their seats; Wu Yi personally brought out several plates of spirit fruit and had fragrant tea served, then withdrew.

"Brother Yang, please accept a bow from Wei and Xuan'er!"

To Yang Kai's great surprise, Wei Guchang suddenly rose and, together with Dong Xuan'er, offered him a most sincere bow.

"Brother Wei, what is this?" Yang Kai was astonished and hurried to help them up.

Wei Guchang grinned: "In all my years I've rarely admired anyone. Even Qu Changfeng and Fang Tianzhong did not make me bow. Brother Yang, you are the first and the only one."

Yang Kai thought for a moment and understood why they were being so solemn. He waved his hand, "Brother Wei, you're overstating it. Last time Elder Qian's escape had little to do with me. I'm sure Elder Qian told you the details — I merely followed City Lord Fei into the Imperial Garden for a look; if not for Lord Fei and the others triggering the restriction, I too would have been trapped."

"But I know that if not for you, Brother Yang, Cai He and Du Sisi would have certainly died. Had they perished in the Imperial Garden, the two families would surely resent Yingyue Hall, so Xuan'er and I must thank you."

Hearing this, Yang Kai did not argue; such words grow hollow when debated. Daiyuan beside him listened in surprise, clearly not expecting he had entered the Imperial Garden.

“It’s a shame that Xuan’er and I were both in seclusion consolidating our cultivation at the time, completely unaware of anything happening outside. If we hadn’t overheard others mentioning it after coming out, we’d probably still be in the dark,” Wei Guchang said, a hint of sorrow flashing across his face. Although he was not Qian Tong’s direct disciple, but rather the Sect Master’s, after so many years of receiving his favour, Qian Tong held no less weight in Wei Guchang’s heart. Now that Qian Tong had suffered such hardship while he had done nothing to help, he couldn’t help but feel deeply guilty whenever he thought of it.

"Those elders of Yingyue Hall were looking out for the two of you. You had only recently broken through the Origin Returning Realm and needed to consolidate your cultivation; how could they disturb you by telling you? Enough of that — Brother Wei, is there any pressing matter today?" Yang Kai saw his gloom and steered the conversation.

"No urgent matter — merely to deliver an invitation." Wei Guchang chuckled and signaled to Dong Xuan'er.

She understood, drew from her Spatial Ring a golden, glittering invitation, and handed it to Yang Kai.

“Whose invitation is it? Don’t tell me Brother Wei and Miss Xuan’er are about to tie the knot?” Yang Kai chuckled, asking with a look of teasing implication.

Dong Xuan'er immediately blushed a deep red, clicked her tongue, and slipped over to Daiyuan, embarrassed.

Wei Guchang gave an inscrutable smile: "Not that, though perhaps one day. Should that day come, we won't forget to send Brother Yang an invitation. But this invitation is not for just anyone."

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and glanced down, astonished: "Jubao Tower?"

"Indeed — Jubao Tower." Wei Guchang returned to his seat, sipped his tea, and said slowly, "An invitation to a Jubao Tower auction. Brother Yang, interested?"

Yang Kai did not answer immediately. He had attended a Jubao Tower auction before and had profited, so he had some interest, but it was not essential. Besides, with the current turmoil and Jubao Tower suddenly holding an auction again, its motives were unclear.

"Eh — still in Tianyun City?" Yang Kai was more surprised. From his understanding, Jubao Tower was the largest commerce alliance on Dark Star, focused on trading to amass Saint Crystals. Their auctions took place every few years or decades, at varying locations rotating among cities belonging to major powers.

Now, only a few years since the last auction, it was to be held again in Tianyun City — a clear break from precedent; strictly speaking, Tianyun City's turn should be a century away.

“Of course it’ll be held in Tianyun City. With all the great forces gathered here and the Imperial Garden suddenly emerging, even if Jubao Tower didn’t plan to host the auction here, I doubt anyone would let them hold it elsewhere,” Wei Guchang said with a chuckle.

With that explanation Yang Kai understood. So many martial artists had gathered in Tianyun City — great and small powers alike — and holding an auction here took full advantage of the opportunity.

Moreover, the Imperial Garden had appeared, and though it could not yet be entered, no one knew when it might open. Many cultivators were already preparing, finding ways to strengthen themselves so they could rush in and claim their share when it did. Under such circumstances, an auction would surely draw a flood of attendees.

After all, the last Jubao Tower auction was staged when Flowing Flame Sandland opened, and the gains were enormous; this time Jubao Tower clearly intends to repeat the same tactic.
