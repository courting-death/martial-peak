## Chapter 645 — A Treatment That Makes Others Envious

Li Rong spoke with a solemn manner, her expression grave.

Yang Kai did not know what swearing in the name of the Great Demon God meant to her, but he could sense her sincerity from her tone and bearing.

Frightened by the Golden Pupil Eye? Otherwise why would the master of Mo Shen Fort suddenly change her attitude so drastically? Yang Kai frowned, unable to make sense of it.

Yet that conjecture was somewhat absurd; Li Rong, after all, was a Saint Realm powerhouse—she could not be so timid.

He nodded lightly, smiling: “No need to be so nervous. I believe you.”

Li Rong breathed a small sigh of relief and appeared noticeably more relaxed; after a moment she resumed her usual composed bearing and spoke softly: “I have seen what you can do. From now on, Mo Shen Fort will provide you with all necessary support. You may study alchemy here without worry; you need not concern yourself with anything else.”

Saying this, Li Rong waved her hand and lifted the seals on the stone chamber, then turned and walked out.

After walking a short distance she turned back and said, “By the way, if you feel bored staying here you can let Guan'er take you out to see the world—no one at Mo Shen Fort will restrict your freedom.”

“I understand.” Yang Kai’s eyes flashed.

Once Li Rong left, Yang Kai silently shook his head. He keenly perceived that the woman’s attitude toward him had shifted somewhat; although she tried to hide it, the change still showed in her expressions and words.

Unable to figure it out and unwilling to waste energy on it, Yang Kai bent his head and continued to focus on refining Pills.

Outside the stone chamber, Li Rong strolled out, glanced back once, her face faintly flushed with excitement. Guan'er hurried over anxiously and asked, “Lady, is everything all right in there?”

“All right.” Li Rong shook her head lightly and admonished, “Take good care of him.”

“Oh.”

Li Rong said no more; her graceful figure swayed and she vanished from sight.

After half a cup of tea’s time, the stone gate to the deepest chamber of Mo Shen Fort was opened and Li Rong hurried inside.

This sealed chamber had been arrayed with countless formations and restrictions; within it were stored the most valuable treasures of Mo Shen Fort, and over the years only the master of Mo Shen Fort had been entitled to enter.

Once inside, Li Rong moved with practiced ease to a corner, took down a thick tome from a shelf—this volume had not been touched in ages and was thickly coated with dust. Li Rong seemed very anxious; she did not bother with ceremony, simply wiped the dust clean and began to leaf through it.

Before long her beautiful eyes fixed on a certain page; she stared blankly, her breath growing rapid, her color becoming faintly excited.

After a very long time Li Rong closed the book, shut her eyes, drew a deep breath to soothe the excitement in her heart, and pondered for a long while.

When she opened her eyes again she had regained her composure, as if a decision had been made; with her deep, beautiful eyes set, she put the book back in its place and hurried out.

The following day.

Yang Kai was refining Pills when the stone chamber’s door was abruptly opened and, led by Guan'er, a great crowd of demon clansmen surged in.

Yang Kai’s expression changed; his True Yuan wavered for a moment and a black mist suddenly burst forth from the cauldron, completely ruining the herbs he was refining.

Guan'er shouted orders and directed those demon clansmen as they busied themselves inside the chamber.

Yang Kai watched for a while, his expression growing strange.

He realized these people were not there to cause him trouble but had brought many items and were decorating the stone chamber.

They carried in an immense, exceedingly comfortable bed and placed it in a corner; others brought tables and chairs, some set down kettles, and several maid-like women placed platter after platter of delicacies and rare wines upon the tables.

Soon the chamber was filled with appetizing aromas.

With their decorations the once cold, monotonous stone room underwent a complete transformation, inexplicably acquiring a warm, homely feeling.

Yang Kai’s brow furrowed; he was filled with questions.

When they finished, Yang Kai beckoned to Guan'er: “Come over here.”

Guan'er glanced at him, somewhat unwilling, and walked over with her head cocked: “What is it?”

“What does this mean?” Yang Kai asked, pointing at the alteration before him.

“Lady Li ordered it,” Guan'er replied. “She told us to take good care of you.”

“There was no need to go to such lengths. Do you have some scheme?” Yang Kai asked warily. The people of Mo Shen Fort did not restrict his freedom and provided him with materials for refining—already more than he had expected. Li Rong suddenly treating him like a distinguished guest made him suspicious.

Guan'er snorted, eyeing Yang Kai up and down: “You despicable, cunning human—did you say something you shouldn’t have in front of Lady Li and dupe her?”

“She is not so easy to deceive.” Yang Kai coldly scoffed.

“You wouldn’t have that ability either!” Guan'er huffed. “Don’t ask me; I’m in the dark too. I’m only following Lady’s orders. That’s all. The things are placed here—take them or don’t!”

Saying so, Guan'er waved her hand and led the bulk of the clan members away.

After they left, Yang Kai began to inspect all that they had brought.

The provisions were excellent and meticulously prepared; although Yang Kai did not recognize the chosen ingredients, he could sense notable energy fluctuations in those dishes—eating them would quickly replenish physical strength and spirit.

The large bed was also carefully crafted from some unknown material, etched with many formation patterns; meditating upon it would restore one’s strength more efficiently. Among the items Guan'er brought were, to his surprise, a considerable number of Crystal Stones.

They truly treated him as a distinguished guest? Yang Kai turned over the dozens of Crystal Stones in his hand, puzzled.

The demon clansmen had been sealed within the Small Xuan Realm for so many years that Crystal Stones ought to be rare to them as well—yet Li Rong had given him dozens at once; she must be bleeding her coffers.

Why was she doing this?

After pondering for a while, Yang Kai gave up worrying, swept the offered dishes clean, filled his belly, rested upon the large bed for a time, and then resumed his alchemy.

In the days that followed, every few days Guan'er would bring carefully prepared food and drink; Yang Kai accepted without hesitation—eating well, drinking well, resting well—spending his days amid herbs and Pills, and his skill at refining steadily climbed.

In just two months, without relying on spirit formations, he could easily refine Heaven-Grade Upper-Level Pills.

Li Rong would also come by from time to time to take a look and observe Yang Kai’s progress and growth.

Such advancement pleased her; the beauty’s face seemed to carry more smiles than before, radiant and glowing.

At Yang Kai’s rate of improvement, provided the materials were sufficient and his cultivation kept pace, it would not take years before he could refine Saint-Grade Pills.

This progress exceeded her expectations and naturally made Li Rong happy.

However Yang Kai keenly noticed that the beauty seemed somewhat fearful of meeting him face to face; each time she came she did so secretly, leaving quietly, watching from a distance or asking after him through Guan'er.

Over these months, through idle chatter with Guan'er, Yang Kai also learned quite a bit about the situation inside the Small Xuan Realm.

The Small Xuan Realm was no small territory; although all the demon clans sealed here belonged to Mo Shen Fort’s lineage, they were divided into four major branches, each governed by a leader.

Yang Kai had met all four leaders: Li Rong, Han Fei, Hua Mo, and Chu Jian—each a Saint Realm powerhouse—their domains separated by great distances, and even traveling between them took half a day.

Among the four, Chu Jian had long sought to seize Li Rong’s place and become the true master of Mo Shen Fort; Han Fei and Hua Mo supported Li Rong, and three against one meant Chu Jian’s belligerence and ambition could not succeed.

Because the leaders were not on friendly terms, their clans disliked one another; Chu Jian’s followers were warmongers, and with no external enemies in the Small Xuan Realm, they could only clash with the clans of the other three territories to vent their fighting spirit.

Despite repeated remonstrations from Li Rong and the other leaders, they could not curb this phenomenon.

The demon race, by nature, was not a peaceful people.

At dawn, after a night of cultivation, the clanspeople of Mo Shen Fort gradually awakened and went out to carry on their activities.

Outside Yang Kai’s stone chamber, Guan'er led a group of maidens carrying delicacies; before they reached the door a youth suddenly leapt out. He had a hooked nose and a sullen expression, his eyes narrow and sharp; with a leering laugh he greeted, “Miss Guan'er, good morning.”

Guan'er’s pretty face soured and she snorted, “What do you want?”

“Nothing much, just saying hello,” the youth chuckled. “Haven’t seen you for months—Miss Guan'er, you’ve become even more radiant. Have you advanced in cultivation?”

“None of your damn business.” Guan'er’s disdain for the youth showed plainly.

“Don’t be so distant—someday we’ll be family anyway,” the youth persisted, unconcerned.

Guan'er’s face darkened; she retorted coldly, “Who said we’re family? Don’t be so shameless.”

“My father said when I ascend to the Transcendent Realm he will ask Lady Li to give you to me—sooner or later you’ll be mine. Aren’t we family by then?” he boasted.

Guan'er laughed scornfully, “Lady Li would never agree. Give up on that hope.”

The youth curled his lip, did not press the matter, eyed her suspiciously and then asked, “Where are you headed?”

“None of your business—move aside!” Guan'er shoved him aside and led the others into the stone chamber.

The youth frowned, stared at Yang Kai within the chamber, then beckoned to the side; a demon clansman immediately hurried over and asked in a low voice, “Any orders?”

“I’ve been in seclusion these months—has anything happened in the fort? Why is there another human here?”

The clansman hurriedly recounted Yang Kai’s arrival and then described the enviable treatment he had been given during his time here.

Hearing this, the youth’s narrow eyes gleamed: “You mean Lady Li gave him dozens of Crystal Stones?”
