## Chapter 23 — An Extraordinary Find

This matter stirred a great commotion among the Ordinary Disciples watching the scene. Were it not for the respect they held for Su Mu’s status, the news would have surely spread like wildfire, with everyone rushing to share it. Yet, since it concerned Su Mu, the crowd showed discretion and refrained from gossiping, keeping the events of the day tightly sealed within their hearts.

At last, the area in front of the small hut fell into quiet.

Glancing at the sky, Yang Kai felt somewhat frustrated. Being delayed by Su Mu today had caused him to miss the allotted time for cultivating the Body Tempering Chapter. It was, without a doubt, a regrettable loss.

Returning to his room, he retrieved his last remaining set of clothes. Then, heading to the nearby pond, he stripped off his tattered garments, preparing for a bath. Having wandered the mountains these past few days and recently fought a battle with a Flower-Backed Spider, his body carried an unpleasant odor.

Unbeknownst to him, Xia Ningshang stealthily approached the side of the hut. She wished to discern her junior brother’s current realm, but from a distance earlier, her view had been unclear. Finding no one inside the hut, she circled to the back. Her bright eyes swept the scene—and what met her gaze were two pale, bare buttocks. Shifting her line of sight, she saw Yang Kai standing completely naked, poised as if about to dive into the water.

Xia Ningshang’s face flushed crimson in an instant. Though her cultivation was high, she was still an innocent maiden untouched by worldly matters. She had never seen a man’s thighs, let alone his bare buttocks. Suddenly witnessing such a scene was too much for her to bear.

Her heart raced wildly with excitement. Hastily, she concealed herself.

Why was she so fated to encounter such a thing today? The poor girl’s tears nearly welled up, and she had no thought left for spying on Yang Kai’s secrets. Stomping her foot, she vanished from sight in a flash.

That wretched junior brother! To be so undisciplined within the sacred grounds of the sect, standing naked in broad daylight—truly shameless and utterly disgraceful!

In the pond, Yang Kai bathed while examining his body.

Since cultivating the Body Tempering Chapter, his muscles had noticeably grown stronger and more solid. Though still lean, his physique now carried a certain vigor.

The wounds left by yesterday’s fierce battle with the Flower-Backed Spider had already begun to scab over, save for the puncture on his arm, which still throbbed faintly.

Such a penetrating injury could not heal quickly, but it was not as severe as he had feared. Judging by its condition, a few more days of rest would suffice for full recovery.

Recalling the life-or-death struggle of the previous day, Yang Kai felt a surge of excitement. He did not understand why, but the more perilous the situation, the more motivated he became. This was not his usual nature—could it be that he subconsciously harbored a masochistic streak, only awakening after more than a decade of life?

With this thought, Yang Kai submerged himself beneath the water, holding his breath deeply before finally surfacing.

Though many tasks awaited him, after finishing his bath and dressing, Yang Kai took up a broom and began sweeping the floor.

After all, this was work within Lingxiao Pavilion. Since he had accepted the task, he must perform it diligently.

As he swept, Yang Kai noticed many senior brothers casting strange, puzzled glances his way. They must have witnessed the morning’s commotion and could not fathom how he had managed to knock Zhao Hu unconscious.

Yang Kai remained calm and focused on his work.

Once finished, he returned to the wooden hut and opened his pack, retrieving the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs he needed, placing the remainder back inside.

The leftover herbs were useless to him but could be sold to the Contribution Hall for some Contribution Points.

Grabbing his pack, Yang Kai prepared to leave but then reconsidered. He changed back into the bloodstained, tattered clothes, painted a large, colorful pattern on his face, and only then dashed out.

At the Contribution Hall, Shopkeeper Meng sat behind the counter, leisurely sipping fragrant tea with his legs crossed, humming a little tune.

Suddenly, a shadow flickered at the door. Meng lazily lifted his eyes, about to scold whoever dared disturb his peace so early, only to see Yang Kai staggering in, his ragged clothes barely concealing his nakedness. His thighs were faintly visible, the fine hairs on his legs clear to see.

Two female disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion passing by the entrance gasped, calling him a rogue, covering their faces in embarrassment as they hurried away.

Shopkeeper Meng, a man of great composure who had faced countless dangers and seen mountains of corpses without flinching, suddenly spat out his tea, utterly losing his dignity.

“Little Yang Kai, what on earth are you doing?” Meng almost lost his composure, hastily standing and staring at Yang Kai in disbelief.

Yang Kai hurried to the counter, catching his breath. “I’m back!”

“Must have suffered quite a bit, huh?” Shopkeeper Meng pitied him deeply. Just a few days ago, Yang Kai had left in good condition. Who would have thought a trip to Black Wind Mountain would leave him in such a sorry state—neither fully man nor ghost. Truly pitiful.

“Yes, it was dangerous,” Yang Kai nodded, cutting to the chase. He opened his pack and pointed to the pile of herbs inside. “But the harvest was good. Shopkeeper Meng, will the Contribution Hall accept these herbs?”

Meng examined them carefully, frowning.

The herbs were only Common Grade, low quality, with little value. The Contribution Hall was already overflowing with such herbs, and there was no place to store more.

Just as he was about to refuse, Meng noticed the hopeful look on Yang Kai’s face and, glancing at his disheveled appearance, his heart softened. “Alright, alright, we’ll take them. Two herbs for one Contribution Point.”

“Then please tally them up,” Yang Kai said without bargaining, pushing the pack forward.

Meng counted carefully: thirty-two herbs in total, amounting to sixteen Contribution Points, which he promptly credited to Yang Kai’s account.

“You spent three days in Black Wind Mountain and only got this?” Meng asked casually.

“Getting these was already a good haul,” Yang Kai replied, glancing around furtively.

“Ahem, yes, it’s good,” Meng said, unwilling to dampen Yang Kai’s spirits. He understood the young man’s hardships. Though talent was lacking, Yang Kai was diligent and hardworking—such young men were rare. A pity his talent was a hard limitation, destined to cap his achievements.

As Meng pondered this, he noticed Yang Kai’s eyes darting suspiciously about and asked, “What are you looking at?”

Leaning in mysteriously, Yang Kai whispered, “Shopkeeper Meng, I think I found something extraordinary on this trip into the mountains.”

Seeing Yang Kai’s cautious demeanor, Meng immediately sensed that this “extraordinary find” was no ordinary matter. He straightened his expression and asked quietly, “What is it?”

“I don’t know. That’s why I brought it back for you to examine. You’ve seen so much; you’ll surely recognize it.” Yang Kai said as he reached behind his back and pulled out another package, gently placing it on the counter.
