## Chapter 1617 — Spiritual Qi Insufficient

On the boundless wasteland, seven or eight Void King Realm masters all turned their gazes toward Yang Kai, waiting in silence for his answer.

The eyes of over a thousand martial artists also converged on Yang Kai, and for a moment Qian Tong's rise to the Void King Realm was completely upstaged.

Xu Binbai stood to one side with a smile, showing no surprise at all; to him, Yang Kai being courted by so many people seemed perfectly natural.

"I understand what you seniors mean," Yang Kai said with a faint nod. "But pardon my insolence—your kindness is more than I deserve. I thank you all for your favor."

Elder Jiu looked stunned—he had not expected Yang Kai to turn down so many sincere invitations and entreaties from Void King Realm experts.

Li Wanning looked equally surprised; beforehand they had guessed that Yang Kai would be unable to refuse such offers, at least joining one of the factions.

But he had rejected them all, which was truly unexpected.

The onlookers erupted in a commotion.

"Is this kid an idiot? Such a golden opportunity right before him, and he just lets it go?"

"He's got to be out of his mind. Why do we cultivate if not for chances and resources? Now they're laid out before him and he refuses—why didn't it fall to me? I'm furious!"

"Elder Jiu, I will join the Hengluo Commerce Guild—take me with you."

"Elder Lei, I have long admired the Sword Alliance—please accept me."

"Senior Li..."

The scene descended into chaos: the invitations from those seven or eight Void King Realm experts had been refused by Yang Kai. They were astonished and uncomfortable; seeing others booing, their expressions soured and they released a bit of their power.

Who could withstand the anger of a Void King Realm master? Sensing their ill temper, the uproar died away, and no one dared act rashly.

"Young Brother, have you thought it over?" Li Wanning asked, hardly daring to believe what she was seeing. She truly could not understand Yang Kai's indifference—her offer had not been poor; it could be said to be the most generous, and she had even promised to personally guide his cultivation.

Personal guidance from a Void King Realm master was something any Origin Returning Realm practitioner would dream of.

And yet he remained unmoved?

"Yes, won't you think about it again?" Elder Jiu said, unwilling to give up as he stared at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head and smiled. "I appreciate your kindness, seniors, but I truly have no intention of joining any faction."

Hearing this, everyone showed looks of regret—they'd missed such a promising young talent; who knew when another like him would appear.

“All right, all right. Since this young brother isn’t willing to join, there’s no need to force him,” Luo Hai said with a gentle smile. “There are still plenty of fine candidates here — surely you all have other prospects in mind?”

"A forced melon isn't sweet; I won't force him. Young Brother, if one day you wish to join the Hengluo Commerce Guild, come seek me on our home star Shuiyue Star—our doors will always be open and the terms I offered will not change," Elder Jiu said with a light nod to Yang Kai.

"The Sword Alliance as well," the old woman surnamed Lei added.

The others likewise expressed that if Yang Kai wished to join later, he could come and find them.

......

The Void King Realm masters who had gathered around Yang Kai dispersed and began searching for other outstanding candidates.

They had come to Cuiwei Star both to lead their faction's disciples in the Blood Prison Trial and to recruit fresh blood after the trial ended.

But Yang Kai had performed so outstandingly that they had all set him as their first target; after his rejection, they naturally moved on to other prospects.

In an instant, many gathered around those Void King Realm masters, volunteering to join them.

Luo Hai did not move; he simply stood in place.

Yang Kai glanced at him, considered briefly, then cupped his hands to Luo Hai. "Thank you for smoothing things over, senior. I will remember it."

Luo Hai cast him a glance and snorted a laugh. "You're welcome—I'm the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star; it's my duty. Hm. You look troubled—does the friend who is breaking through have some relation to you?"

Yang Kai didn’t bother denying it — before such powerful figures, there was no point. He simply nodded and said, “Yes, he’s a senior of mine.”

"No wonder you weren't tempted by their offers—so your own elder is about to rise to the Void King Realm!" Luo Hai said with a knowing laugh. "I'm curious—where do you come from? How is every one of you so exceptional?"

While speaking, he looked at Yang Xiuzhu and Chu Hanyi, who had stood by Yang Kai. With his vision he could see that these people had cultivated the Origin Returning Realm to its utmost at this Stage, only lacking some understanding of Shi to have the qualification to ascend to the Void King Realm.

In other words, within the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm they were absolute standouts.

Yang Kai frowned; though reluctant, he replied, "We are from Dark Star."

"Dark Star..." Luo Hai frowned; even with his broad experience the name Dark Star felt unfamiliar. He regarded Yang Kai with deep interest and smiled. "That must be a fine place!"

He had thought Yang Kai might have invented the name of a cultivation star to fool him.

He did not pursue it further and fell silent, expression calm as he stared ahead, his thoughts vast as an ocean.

Yang Kai lifted his eyes and watched the position where Qian Tong stood with close attention.

There, Qian Tong's field of Shi had already spread out to a radius of a thousand zhang; countless tornadoes of varying sizes swirled within it, splitting and merging—small whirlwinds forming into larger ones and large ones breaking into several smaller vortices.

The ground within that thousand-zhang radius looked as if plowed by iron furrows, ridges and gullies jagged and crisscrossed.

Staggering and terrifying Heaven-and-Earth Energy gathered into the sky above that patch of land, gradually forming ink-dark clouds that pressed upon the heavens like a heavy quilt; the oppressive atmosphere made it nearly hard to breathe.

Yang Kai's heart trembled.

He sensed that those clouds contained an exceedingly dreadful Heaven-and-Earth Energy, a presence even he greatly feared.

And it was not over; the surrounding Spiritual Qi continued to rush toward that place.

Time passed bit by bit, the clamor gradually subsided, and the Void King Realm masters who had been recruiting returned one by one—each had gained something, though the terms they offered those they recruited now differed greatly from those previously offered to Yang Kai.

Not only did the recruits have to undergo high-difficulty trials, even if they passed they would not enjoy the same treatment as Yang Kai had been promised.

No one dared complain.

Bargaining with a Void King Realm master—what else could it be but courting death!

Over a thousand pairs of eyes fixed on Qian Tong's position; a few Void King Realm masters gathered and whispered together.

Soon they seemed to have received some intelligence from Luo Hai; they all looked astonished at Yang Kai. "Young Brother, is the one breaking through your elder?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

"His temper isn't like yours, is it?" Elder Jiu teased.

Having failed to recruit Yang Kai, they felt regret. But here and now there was an even more valuable prize to court—Qian Tong, who was in the midst of ascending!

After all, however gifted Yang Kai might be, his future was still uncertain.

The Star Domain was vast and full of geniuses, yet most perished in their rise and never reached the peak of martial Dao. Conversely, some obscure figures who toiled in silence ultimately laughed last and achieved great renown.

Not every Void King Realm master present had been a top prodigy, yet they were now among the mightiest warriors in the Star Domain.

In comparison, Qian Tong and Yang Kai bore different weights—if Qian Tong succeeded in ascending, he would be a bona fide Void King Realm master.

Each faction had few Void King Realm masters; an additional one could greatly strengthen their power.

In short, they were determined to secure Qian Tong.

Of course, assuming he could ascend successfully.

"Are you trying to court him?" Yang Kai quickly understood.

"Indeed," Elder Jiu nodded.

“In that case, you can speak to him yourselves when the time comes. Whether he’s willing or not, that senior of mine surely has his own mind about it.”

"You brat..." Elder Jiu only managed a helpless smile.

After that, none spoke further; everyone watched Qian Tong's ascension.

At a certain moment Yang Kai suddenly frowned and looked up at the ink-dark clouds overhead, feeling vaguely that something was amiss.

For some reason, though the clouds had been swelling and absorbing Heaven-and-Earth Energy from within a radius of ten thousand li, they had yet to baptize Qian Tong.

Great ascensions must be accompanied by a baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy so the warrior can break his limitations.

The baptism's delay left only an extremely oppressive atmosphere, making everyone uneasy.

"Brother Yang, the concentration of Heaven-and-Earth Energy seems insufficient!" Xu Binbai suddenly moved close and said in a low voice.

"Is that the problem?" Yang Kai's face showed surprise.

"Yes. As I stand at the peak of the third stage of the Origin Returning Realm, I could break through to the Void King Realm at any time, so before I came out my master taught me some principles for ascending. What matters most is that the Heaven-and-Earth Energy must be abundant when one ascends—my master told me to seek a place rich in energy when the time came," Xu Binbai explained.

Yang Kai's brow tightened.

Though Cuiwei Star's Spiritual Qi was not bad, it varied by location; the wasteland's Spiritual Qi was not particularly strong and obviously could not meet Qian Tong's requirements for ascending.

"Is there a solution?" Yang Kai asked anxiously.

"Of course there's a solution," Xu Binbai replied. Elder Jiu suddenly laughed. "If the Spiritual Qi is insufficient, think of ways to supplement it—Saint Crystals are the best choice. Young Brother, shall I lend you some Saint Crystals? I have little else, but Saint Crystals I have in abundance."
