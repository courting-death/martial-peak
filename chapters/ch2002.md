## Chapter 2002 — Gentle Refusal

“May I ask, Brother Yang, was there truly no treasure on that Dragon Ascension Altar?”

Qin Yu's voice reached Yang Kai's ear with pinpoint accuracy.

"Miss Qin, why would you ask that?" Yang Kai asked, staring at Qin Yu with a baffled expression, visibly surprised.

Qin Yu studied Yang Kai closely, her clear, flawless eyes fixed on his, as if she wished to peer into the depths of his heart.

Yang Kai met her gaze calmly; then he suddenly frowned and said in a low voice, "Miss Qin, do you mean... could it be that those ten or so treasures on the Dragon Ascension Altar were not all illusions?"

"Heh heh..." Qin Yu smiled. "I cannot be certain either, I only asked out of curiosity. At the time it was only Brother Yang, Brother Duan, and Brother Zong near the Dragon Ascension Altar, and those ten or so items were inspected by you."

Yang Kai shook his head. "At any rate I saw no treasure, and from my observation those two did not gain anything either."

"I see, then I must have overthought it," Qin Yu said apologetically, nodding her head.

"Is that what you wished to ask, Miss Qin?"

"Yes. Sorry for taking Brother Yang's time."

"No matter, no matter. Since there is nothing else, I will take my leave." Yang Kai cupped his fists and prepared to depart.

"Brother Yang, wait!" Qin Yu suddenly called after him.

"What is it now?" Yang Kai asked, frowning and slightly displeased; otherwise, seeing the other was a frail woman and of fairly pleasant temperament, he would have been too lazy to entertain her, for he had had no prior dealings with Qin Yu.

"Brother Yang, calm your anger. I wanted to ask: you are going to look for the entrance into the second layer next, right?"

"And so?" Yang Kai did not deny it.

"Then do you know where the entrance lies?"

Yang Kai shook his head; he only knew the entrance was a Five-Colored Pillar of Light reaching heaven and earth, but he had no idea where that pillar specifically stood—Kang Siran had not told him.

However, since it was a Five-Colored Pillar of Light connecting heaven and earth, it ought not be too difficult to find; so long as the distance was not great, one should discover it.

Seeing Qin Yu's mysterious expression, Yang Kai suddenly realized matters might not be as simple as he had imagined; his face shifted as he asked, "Miss Qin, do you know where the entrance is?"

"I do not know the exact location either," Qin Yu said apologetically, shaking her head.

Yang Kai was momentarily speechless.

Qin Yu grinned again. "Although I do not know the exact spot, I do know roughly..."

Saying that, she suddenly recited softly: “Among the mountains… misty clouds crown the peaks, a clear spring runs through the ravine, and a pillar of light appears.”

“Among the mountains… misty clouds crown the peaks? A clear spring in the ravine… a pillar of light appears?” Yang Kai repeated with furrowed brow.

"Exactly!" Qin Yu nodded. "Although the Five-Colored Pillar of Light reaches heaven and earth, if you do not search the right place, you cannot discover it. Even brushing past it might cost you the chance."

"Is that also something you read in the classics?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

Qin Yu nodded.

"Miss Qin truly is well-read and learned!" Yang Kai admired.

Qin Yu's pale face flushed slightly, making her instantly look more lively; she waved her head and said, "Brother Yang flatters me. I merely like reading a jumble of trivial things, not fit for lofty halls. Actually, I am also heading to search for the entrance to the second layer—if Brother Yang does not mind, would you accompany me?"

She had openly extended an invitation to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai glanced at the tower-ship Secret Treasure behind her, his expression showing temptation.

With that vessel one could conserve a great deal of energy; he could even rest aboard it to keep his spirit replenished—hardly a bad idea.

But...

"I have grown used to traveling alone, so I appreciate Miss Qin's kindness," Yang Kai said after a moment's thought, and he politely declined Qin Yu's offer.

Qin Yu showed a trace of disappointment but did not press the matter; she nodded and said, "In that case I will not trouble Brother Yang. I wish you good luck."

"You too—farewell!" Yang Kai bowed and turned to leave.

"Ungrateful!" After his figure vanished, a guard beside Qin Yu snorted coldly at the direction Yang Kai had gone, his face full of displeasure, plainly feeling it an injustice to Qin Yu.

Qin Yu smiled faintly. "He is simply careful in his actions; how does that make him ungrateful? I think his choice is the reasonable one."

"That only proves Miss has a kind and merciful heart," the guard said, his face showing displeasure. "By the way, Miss, why did you question him like that earlier—aren't the treasures on the Dragon Ascension Altar all mere illusions?"

"Perhaps... but... what I saw in the classics differs somewhat; I do not know the precise truth."

After saying a few words, Qin Yu suddenly began to cough violently.

The guard grew alarmed and hurriedly said, "Miss, you'd better return to the tower-ship quickly; it's windy out here."

"Mm." Qin Yu hurriedly nodded and turned back toward the tower-ship.

……

Meanwhile, somewhere on the first layer a slight, petite woman with a striking crescent‑shaped birthmark on her cheek could be seen — none other than Mo Xiaoqi, who had entered the Five‑Colored Treasure Pagoda with Yang Kai before they separated.

At that moment Mo Xiaoqi rode a demonic beast resembling a lion and tiger; the creature wore a ferocious visage, its fur silver-white, its bulk enormous, and the hot breath that spewed from its nostrils carried an inexplicable force that corroded the ground into pits where it struck.

Any onlooker would be greatly astonished.

For the beast beneath Mo Xiaoqi was the renowned Silver-Maned Lion-Tiger Beast; although it had not inherited the bloodline of an Ancient Divine Spirit, it was exceedingly troublesome—born as a Fifth-Tier demonic beast, and depending on its innate fortune, at its peak it could grow to the Tenth-Tier or even the Eleventh.

In other words, it could match practitioners of the Void King Realm or even the Dao Origin Realm.

There were even rumors of lion-tiger beasts that cultivated to the Emperor Realm reaching the Twelfth-Tier!

This particular Silver-Maned Lion-Tiger clearly was not on par with the Dao Origin Realm; it merely emitted the aura of a Tenth-Tier peak, yet it was still not to be taken lightly.

Silver‑maned Lion‑Tiger Beasts are born ferocious and combative—no ordinary cultivator can hope to bring one to heel. Even an Emperor‑Realm expert might not succeed; the most likely outcome is the beast fighting desperately to the death, finally collapsing from utter exhaustion.

Yet now this majestic Silver-Maned Lion-Tiger served as Mo Xiaoqi's mount without any resentment; instead it obeyed her without question, making no move contrary to her commands, a sight that was truly hard to believe.

Ahead of Mo Xiaoqi there hovered a palm-sized strange beast, flying about like a bat and seemingly insignificant, but its power fluctuations revealed it to be a Tenth-Tier demonic beast as well.

The Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat, like the Silver-Maned Lion-Tiger Beast, was an extremely rare species.

It was anyone's guess what method Mo Xiaoqi had used to get along so seamlessly with the two demonic beasts—and to bend them to her will so they obeyed her without question.

Nor was it clear whether she had tamed these two demonic beasts after entering the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda or if they had been hers already.

"Xiao Fu, hurry and find it—find the entrance and I'll give you a treat. This way, this way... Xiao Yin, hurry up and keep pace, don't be so slow," Mo Xiaoqi said from atop the Lion-Tiger, evidently searching for the entrance into the second layer.

The Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat Mo Xiaoqi called Xiao Fu seemed to possess special abilities; it led her on swiftly until they reached a place encircled by mountains, where the ravine was shrouded in mist and the peaks rose straight to the sky, their summits lost from sight—an astonishing sight.

Somewhere among those mountains the sound of a spring tinkled without end.

The Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat flew directly to the spring and began circling over a certain spot.

Mo Xiaoqi quickly urged the Lion-Tiger to follow and when she arrived she looked up and burst into a giggle: "Not hard to find... I'm definitely the first one here, hehe."

As she prepared to move forward she suddenly recalled something and said, "Oh right, check where Brother Yang is."

While speaking she produced a round bead from her Spatial Ring and input several spells into it; after a moment she showed disappointment and gritted her teeth, "Damn it, in this damned place the voice bead doesn't work—are the heavenly laws too broken? Oh well, Brother Yang will surely come here too. Xiao Fu, wait here; when you see Brother Yang, bring him into the second layer to find me."

Having given the order, she took out a jade tablet, filled it with Divine Sense, left some information, handed it to the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat, and then dashed forward in high spirits.

Not far ahead a flash of light passed and Mo Xiaoqi and the Lion-Tiger were gone without a trace.

The Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat remained behind; it circled once around the area, then suddenly alighted beside a pile of rubble and sank into the ground until it disappeared.

……

On the third layer of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, Lan Xun walked about, surveying her surroundings; a faint glow emanated from her body that seemed to ward off all danger.

Suddenly she halted in a secluded valley, sensed carefully, and her face lit with joy: "This is it."

She took many Formation Plates and Formation Foundations from her Spatial Ring and busied herself nearby.

Two days later she had arranged everything and piled a large number of Source Crystals nearby; then she sat cross-legged, quietly operating profound arts and began to press against the bottleneck of the Dao Origin Realm.

As time passed, Lan Xun's delicate form strangely began to emit an attraction, and numerous firefly-like things suddenly appeared nearby—these resembled the starlight Yang Kai had absorbed earlier in the Starlight Passage.

Yet upon careful perception the two were fundamentally different in essence.

The starlight within the Starlight Passage acted as a catalyst, allowing a practitioner's Saint Yuan to rapidly transform into Origin Qi.

But the starlight here contained many broken heavenly laws.

As the starlight entered her body, Lan Xun comprehended the Power of the Laws, and the fluctuations of her aura grew ever stronger.
