## Chapter 2385 — Strengths and Weaknesses

After waiting for a full hour without any sign of Sangde, Yang Kai grew extremely impatient and began to suspect that Sangde was deceiving him. Just then, the beautiful woman across from him suddenly took out a communication bead and frowned as she checked it.

This unusual movement caught Yang Kai’s attention. If this beautiful woman was the helper Sangde had invited, then there must be some clues to be found from her.

The woman quickly put away the communication bead, then leapt into the air and shot off toward the depths of the sea.

Was he wrong? Yang Kai was taken aback. The woman left the dock without saying a word—could it be she wasn’t with him after all?

Just as Yang Kai was growing suspicious, a soft, gentle voice suddenly sounded by his ear: “We’ll set out after a cup of tea’s time. Wait for me at sea!”

That voice was definitely transmitted by the beautiful woman. Thinking back to when she took out the communication bead, Yang Kai immediately understood—Sangde must have secretly sent her a message, then had her pass it on to him.

Realizing this, Yang Kai smiled slightly, thinking to himself that Sangde was truly cautious. But he couldn’t really blame him—Sangde was too famous in Tongtian City, and it would be easy for others to recognize him. If someone saw him taking people out to sea at the dock, it would surely arouse suspicion, especially from the masters of Tongtian Island and Ice Heart Pavilion.

Now, no one knew how Sangde had managed to leave Tongtian City without a trace. Only after the fact did he quietly send messages to the woman and Yang Kai, showing just how meticulous he was.

As the woman had said, Yang Kai waited at the dock for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea. Then, his figure suddenly flickered and he vanished from where he stood.

The martial artist who had been secretly watching him from the shadows had no idea what had happened. He only saw Yang Kai’s figure blur for a moment before disappearing entirely. Startled, he hurriedly sent a message to Yu Leping.

In no time at all, the furious Yu Leping rushed to the dock, his face dark as he scanned the surroundings. Soon, his gaze fixed on the depths of the sea.

Since Yang Kai hadn’t returned to the city and wasn’t at the dock, the only explanation was that he had already gone out to sea.

This was a heaven-sent opportunity that Yu Leping naturally didn’t want to miss. He immediately summoned a multi-deck ship, gathered a group of men, and charged out of the dock toward the open sea.

……

Yang Kai had been flying over the sea for less than a quarter of an hour when he spotted a multi-deck ship anchored in the distance. He could just make out several figures on the deck, all watching in his direction. As soon as he appeared, one of them immediately waved a flag.

Seeing this, Yang Kai didn’t hesitate and shot straight toward the multi-deck ship.

Moments later, he landed on the deck. Looking around, he saw four people standing there. The beautiful woman he’d seen earlier was among them, now smiling at him, her eyes roaming up and down as if trying to see right through him.

As for the other two, Yang Kai didn’t recognize them. One was built like a bear, with a broad waist and a back like a tiger. His burly muscles looked like works of art, radiating a unique luster and the beauty of strength. He was even a head taller than Yang Kai, and just standing there, he exuded an overwhelming sense of pressure.

The other man didn’t look remarkable at all—completely ordinary, with nothing distinctive about him. He seemed like someone you’d lose in a crowd. But his expression was extremely cold, and from where he stood, Yang Kai could tell he was a very proud person. He kept his distance from the beautiful woman and the burly man, as if he disdained being associated with them.

When Yang Kai boarded the ship, this man had only glanced at him casually before looking away, as if Yang Kai wasn’t even worth his attention.

The fourth person on the ship was, of course, Sangde.

He seemed to be using some kind of Secret Treasure to alter his appearance and aura. If Yang Kai hadn’t already known, he might not have recognized him. Now, Sangde had shed his old man’s appearance and transformed into a middle-aged man.

No wonder he could slip out of Tongtian City without a trace. With such a miraculous Secret Treasure to help him, what couldn’t he accomplish?

“Everyone’s here.” The middle-aged man, who was actually Sangde in disguise, spoke in a low voice as Yang Kai arrived. Forming a series of hand seals, he urged the multi-deck ship forward, setting their course ahead.

“Everyone may be here, but Master, shouldn’t you introduce us? It’ll be easier to work together if we know each other.” The beautiful woman suddenly giggled, her laughter as clear as bells, with a hint of enchantment that made one’s heart flutter.

As she spoke, she used a Charm Technique. A faint fragrance drifted across the deck, making everyone who inhaled it feel hot and restless.

“Snake Lady, are you looking for death?” The proud young man suddenly snorted coldly, his unremarkable eyes flashing with a sharp light as he stared at the beautiful woman. “If you don’t put away your Charm Technique, I’ll throw you into the sea to feed the fish right now!”

The woman called Snake Lady just smiled faintly, not taking his threat to heart at all. She said with a smile, “Why so angry? You’re scaring me.”

As she spoke, a strange sound suddenly came from the deck.

Yang Kai looked closely and felt his scalp tingle. At some point, countless snakes and pythons of all sizes had appeared on the deck. They all looked extremely venomous, and now they were surrounding the young man, flicking their tongues, making for a chilling sight.

“Putting on a show!” The young man’s expression didn’t change at all. He ignored the snakes, looking calmly at Snake Lady as if he wasn’t afraid of her in the slightest.

The two of them had made things so tense right from the start—who knew if there was some old grudge between them?

“Anyone who dares make more noise can get off my ship right now!” Sangde snorted coldly, his stern gaze sweeping the deck. Snake Lady and the young man immediately fell silent.

If Sangde were just a master of artifact refinement, he might not be able to keep these unruly types in check on the Jixu Sea. But Sangde wasn’t just a master refiner—his own strength was in no way inferior to theirs.

“Put your pets away. They make me uneasy!” Sangde glared at Snake Lady.

Snake Lady pursed her lips and said sweetly, “If Master commands, how could I dare disobey?”

She placed her jade hand to her red lips and gave a gentle whistle. In an instant, all the venomous snakes on the deck vanished without a trace—who knew where they’d gone?

Sangde said, “Actually, you’ve all probably heard each other’s names, even if you haven’t met before. There’s no need for me to introduce you. Just state your names yourselves.”

Snake Lady nodded. “Indeed. I’ve met you all before, so let’s take care of each other on this journey.”

As she spoke, her enchanting eyes sparkled, and her voice was soft and teasing, enough to make anyone’s heart flutter.

The proud young man snorted and said, “Shen Fei!”

After giving his name, he said nothing more. For him, even one extra word was a disgrace.

The burly man grinned, scratched his head, and rumbled, “I’m Man Kuai!”

He looked simple and honest to the extreme, but everyone knew that if you were fooled by his appearance, you’d be the one to suffer. Anyone who could make a name for themselves on Tongtian Island was anything but simple—the simple ones had all perished long ago.

“So it really is Brother Man!” Snake Lady’s beautiful eyes lit up, as if she’d long heard of Man Kuai’s reputation. As she spoke, she pressed her body against him, her voice sweet as she said, “I’ve admired Brother Man for a long time. Today I finally get to meet you—it’s truly as the rumors say.” As she spoke, she reached out her slender fingers and gently stroked Man Kuai’s muscular arm, her expression hungry, her breathing quickening, and her eyes brimming with flirtation.

Man Kuai obligingly flexed his muscles and grinned. “If you like them, feel free to touch. This is my only real skill!”

Snake Lady licked her red lips. “Is that so? Surely Brother Man has more than just that to be proud of?”

Man Kuai chuckled. “Naturally I do.”

“And how big is it?”

“Big enough to fully explore Young Sister’s depths!”

“Then we’ll have to get much closer.”

The shameless flirting between this pair, right out in the open for all to see, left Yang Kai and the others speechless. They were like a pair of toads eyeing each other. Yang Kai and the others could only watch with exasperation.

“And what’s your name, friend? You look unfamiliar.” Shen Fei seemed unwilling to look at the shameless pair, so he turned to Yang Kai and asked.

As soon as he spoke, Man Kuai and Snake Lady also turned their attention to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, cupped his fists, and said, “Yang Kai!”

“Yang Kai?” Shen Fei frowned. He and Man Kuai exchanged glances, both showing confusion—they’d never heard of Yang Kai before.

“So it’s Brother Yang. My apologies.” Snake Lady left Man Kuai’s side and sidled up to Yang Kai, pressing her body against him. Her eyes were full of flirtation as she said, “Does Brother have any strengths? Why not share them with your big sister?”

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he replied, “No, no, I’m all weaknesses from head to toe—not a single strength to speak of.”

“How could that be?” Snake Lady giggled. “If you’re a man, you must have some strengths. Don’t be so shy, Brother.”

Yang Kai’s face turned cold. “Auntie, how old are you? Calling me ‘Brother’—have some shame, will you?”

Snake Lady’s smile froze, and a chill radiated from her as she turned to Sangde. “Master, where did you find this guy? Can I tear his mouth off?”

Sangde’s face darkened. “Looks like you didn’t take my words to heart just now.”

Snake Lady trembled with rage, gritting her teeth. “Master, I’ve long heard of Brother Man and Shen Fei—they’re both famous lone experts on the island. But who is this brat? What right does he have to work with us?”
