## Chapter 2137 — The Entrance Opens

Kou Wu had escaped disaster only because he had been away on business with Bian Yuqing. Otherwise, given Wu Mengchuan’s temperament at the time, it wouldn’t have been surprising if he had killed them all.

“Looks like... you’ve remembered something!” Bian Yuqing suddenly sneered, gritting her teeth. “Brat, if not for you, this Protector wouldn’t have ended up in such a state. Now my life and death are in someone else’s hands!”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly as he feigned ignorance. “Protector Bian, what are you talking about? I don’t understand.”

Kou Wu sighed and said, “Junior Brother Yang, Sect Master... you were the one who let him out, weren’t you?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai couldn’t deny it and nodded. “That’s right!”

After speaking, he quickly added, “But I had no choice at the time. Senior Brother Kou, you and Protector Bian weren’t in the Sect, and I was locked in the Bone Prison, facing death. With no other option, I made a deal with Wu Mengchuan.”

Bian Yuqing snorted, “After the Sect Master got out, he slaughtered everywhere. The entire Biyu Sect was nearly wiped out. Only a few who reacted quickly and sided with the Sect Master survived.”

Yang Kai chuckled, “Protector Bian, you were one of them, weren’t you?”

“Me?” Bian Yuqing snorted coldly. “I was just lucky. A month after that incident, I returned to the Sect with Kou Wu, only to find the Sect had undergone drastic changes. By the time I realized and tried to escape, it was too late. But the Sect Master didn’t kill me. Maybe... he thought leaving himself all alone wasn’t good, so he spared my life. Only...” At this, her face twisted with resentment. “He placed a restriction on me. From now on, I have to obey his every command.”

“So that’s how it is!” Yang Kai looked as if he understood everything.

“This whole mess was caused by you, brat. Tell me, how should I punish you to vent my anger?” Bian Yuqing stared at Yang Kai with a sinister look, clearly wanting to teach him a harsh lesson.

Yang Kai smiled, “Protector Bian, since you all chose to act against Wu Mengchuan years ago, you must have known something about him. For someone like that, you either eliminate him completely or don’t provoke him at all. Not only did you provoke him, you even imprisoned and tortured him... Didn’t you think there would be consequences?”

Bian Yuqing frowned, staring at Yang Kai. “What are you trying to say?”

Yang Kai said, “I’m just saying, even without me, Wu Mengchuan would have escaped eventually. So your misfortune isn’t really my fault.”

“Nonsense!” Bian Yuqing’s face was full of anger.

Yang Kai spread his hands. "Besides, Protector Bian, aren’t you still perfectly fine? Even if a restriction’s been planted on you, the man is that one’s descendant. Once he rises to prominence in the future, are you really afraid he won’t bring you glory and wealth? It’s just a bit of temporary humiliation—surely Protector Bian can endure that much, no?”

Bian Yuqing looked at him coldly and snorted, “Why does it sound like I’ve gained a huge advantage... Should I thank you?”

“No need for that,” Yang Kai waved his hand.

Bian Yuqing said helplessly, “It’s too late to say anything now. Kou Wu and I can only take things one step at a time.”

Seeing she didn’t really intend to take revenge, Yang Kai finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Kou Wu smiled, “Protector Bian and I came to the Four Seasons Land this time on the Sect Master’s orders, representing Biyu Sect. We saw you at Qingyang Shrine, so we called you over to ask a few things.”

Biyu Sect is a small sect. Though it doesn’t have any Emperor Realm experts, it used to have several in the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, so it was allotted two spots to enter the Four Seasons Land.

Last time, Wu Mengchuan’s slaughter left Biyu Sect in decline, so only Bian Yuqing and Kou Wu could come this time.

“Information about the Four Seasons Land?” Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

“That’s right.” Bian Yuqing nodded. “Don’t tell me you know nothing. Since you managed to blend in at Qingyang Shrine, you must know more than we do.”

Yang Kai frowned and pondered for a moment. “I do have some information... but it’s the sect’s secret, so I can’t really reveal it.”

Bian Yuqing smiled slightly. “If you don’t say and I don’t say, who would know?”

Yang Kai shook his head.

Just as Bian Yuqing was about to say more, Yang Kai said, “The only thing I can tell you is this: this time Star Seals will appear inside the Four Seasons Land.”

“Star seals?” Kou Wu frowned, clearly not knowing what that was.

Bian Yuqing seemed to recall something. After pondering, she exclaimed, “You mean the pass to enter the Shattered Star Sea?”

“Exactly!” Yang Kai nodded.

“Shattered Star Sea?” Kou Wu finally reacted, exclaiming in shock.

Yang Kai smiled, “You two should do your best. If we encounter each other inside the Four Seasons Land, maybe we can join forces!”

With that, he ignored the two and walked off on his own.

To him, neither Bian Yuqing nor Kou Wu were close acquaintances. The little help he received in Biyu Sect was repaid with the information he just gave.

After this, he had no more grudges with the two. If they meant him no harm, all was well. If they did, he wouldn’t hesitate to be ruthless—after all, they now counted as Wu Mengchuan’s people.

Yang Kai was quite wary of this descendant of the Heaven Devouring Emperor.

Back then, Wu Mengchuan had actually taught him a complete set of the Heaven Devouring Battle Art, a technique inherited from the Heaven Devouring Emperor. It was with this technique that the Heaven Devouring Emperor became number one in the Star Realm.

To think Wu Mengchuan harbored no scheme was something Yang Kai could never believe. What baffled him was what the man was truly after—why he would even go so far as to pass the Heaven Devouring Battle Art to him.

He hadn’t cultivated the technique himself, but had given it to his Incarnation. After some time cultivating, the Incarnation’s strength had greatly increased, and from it, Yang Kai had learned just how heaven-defying the technique was.

If not for his concerns, he would have long since given in to temptation and cultivated it himself.

Lost in thought, Yang Kai soon returned to the Qingyang Shrine’s residence.

Everyone was quietly meditating and recovering, making the most of the last bit of time to maintain peak condition.

Only Xiao Baiyi opened his eyes to glance at him, but said nothing more.

Time passed day by day.

As time went on, the Spiritual Qi in the Nameless Valley grew denser and denser, until it finally reached the point where it condensed into mist.

If one looked down from above, the entire valley was shrouded in a white fog. But this wasn’t real fog—it was a sign of Spiritual Qi condensing.

The cultivation environment here reached an unbelievable level.

If someone could cultivate here for a long time, their strength would naturally increase at an extraordinary rate.

Unfortunately, this was only a sign that the secret realm was about to open. Even a sect like Star God Palace didn’t have such a jaw-dropping cultivation ground.

Finally, on the fourth day after everyone arrived at the Nameless Valley, a strange sound suddenly rang out.

The sound was ethereal and elusive, as if coming from the void, impossible to pinpoint.

Immediately, the Spiritual Qi surged and boiled, clouds and mist rolling wildly, all rushing toward a certain spot.

That spot was right at the center of the valley—the only open area.

It seemed all the sects knew the secret realm’s entrance was here, so no force had set up camp in that place.

In that instant, all the martial artists opened their eyes and looked over.

“It’s starting!” At the Star God Palace’s camp, Xiao Yuyang called out in a low voice. The disciples were all excited, secretly preparing themselves.

“The entrance is about to open!” At the Qingyang Shrine’s camp, Gao Xueting looked at the twenty people before her and said, “I hope you can stick together inside and avoid getting separated. Of course, if anyone insists on acting alone, just pretend I didn’t say anything.”

After a pause, she added, “I hope you all return safely!”

Xia Sheng grinned, “Don’t worry, Elder Gao. I’ll take good care of them.”

Gao Xueting nodded, said no more, and turned to look at the place where the Spiritual Qi was gathering.

At this moment, all the Spiritual Qi in the world was surging toward that spot. The swirling Qi whipped up fierce winds, sand and stones flying in the valley, but it didn’t affect the Dao Origin Realm martial artists’ observation.

When all the Qi reached that spot, it fell into a void like a black hole—instantly vanishing.

At that point, space suddenly became unstable.

As more Qi poured in, the instability grew more and more obvious.

Until, at a certain moment, the void suddenly split open, revealing a crack visible to the naked eye.

The Qi kept pouring in, and the crack grew larger. Looking up, it was as if a mighty expert had opened a skylight in the heavens. Through that skylight, one could vaguely see some scenery on the other side—ethereal and ever-changing.

This continued for a full half hour.

After half an hour, the valley’s Qi, which had been so dense it formed mist, was completely gone, all sucked into the void crack.

The valley was now utterly devoid of Qi, returning to its usual desolate state.

The crack was now over ten zhang long and five zhang high.

“The entrance is open!” someone exclaimed.

“Go!” Someone else couldn’t wait, leaping over everyone’s heads and charging straight for the narrow entrance.

They were a pair from a small sect—like Biyu Sect, which had only two spots, one for a man and one for a woman. They seemed to have cultivated a joint secret technique; once activated their speed was astonishing, and the two became a streak of light rushing in first.

They probably thought getting in early would give them an advantage.

Unfortunately, things didn’t go as they wished.

Several Emperor Realm experts from major sects watched coldly, not bothering to stop them.

Gao Xueting sighed. "It seems there are always reckless ones every time!"

As soon as she finished speaking, two miserable screams came from the void.
