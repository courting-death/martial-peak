## Chapter 2227 — Yi Quan

Yang Kai followed behind Bai Lu, ascending the spiraling staircase all the way up.

After walking for a full quarter of an hour, the staircase finally ended, revealing another grand hall ahead. The side door of the hall was set into the trunk, with light streaming in from outside.

Yang Kai glanced outside and found that they were already several thousand zhang above the ground. Everything below was shrouded in mist, indistinct and unclear.

Upon reaching this place, a gaze so tangible it felt solid immediately locked onto him.

Yang Kai instantly became alert and turned his head, only to see a middle-aged man in plain clothes, with an ordinary appearance and a head of black hair, standing to the side with his hands behind his back, smiling at him.

Yuan Fei, who had arrived earlier, stood respectfully to the side, looking tense and reserved.

The master of Heavenly Yao Mountain! This thought suddenly popped into Yang Kai’s mind. Although he couldn’t see anything particularly striking about this middle-aged man—he seemed just like any ordinary person in a crowd—Yang Kai was still certain that this was the Third Stage Emperor Realm expert who had acted just now, the master of Heavenly Yao Mountain, and also the father of Purple Civet!

Yang Kai straightened up respectfully, cupped his fists, and said, “Junior Yang Kai greets Senior!”

The middle-aged man nodded slightly at these words but did not speak. Instead, he slowly raised a hand and pointed at Yang Kai from afar.

Yang Kai hadn’t yet figured out what this gesture meant when his expression suddenly changed. He hurriedly mobilized his Divine Soul power, forming an invisible shield in front of him.

With a soft hiss, a surge of force struck head-on, easily shattering Yang Kai’s defense.

Yang Kai was greatly shocked and quickly retreated several steps.

But he soon stopped, realizing that the other’s strike was perfectly controlled—only breaking his defense and doing nothing more. In other words, this move posed no real threat to him; it seemed to be just a test…

“Senior, what is the meaning of this?” Yang Kai frowned and asked. Why would a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert test him like this? With his cultivation, the other could see through him at a glance.

“Hmm?” The middle-aged man raised his brows, looking at Yang Kai with some suspicion. “Why didn’t you use your Divine Soul Secret Treasure?”

Yang Kai replied, “I encountered a powerful enemy earlier. My Secret Treasure was destroyed and can no longer be used…”

As he spoke, Yang Kai’s eyes widened in astonishment. “Senior, you…”

In that instant, he realized—the man had just mentioned the words ‘Divine Soul Secret Treasure’!

That’s not something a cultivator from the Divine Roaming world could know. Divine Soul Secret Treasures are things only cultivators from the outside world possess. In the Divine Roaming world, due to the lack of materials to forge Secret Treasures, they could never have such things, let alone understand them.

Yet this middle-aged man had spoken the name of something he shouldn’t even know exists.

How could Yang Kai not be shocked by this?

“What?” The middle-aged man smiled faintly. “You think this Lord knows nothing?”

Although the words seemed out of nowhere, Yang Kai understood what he meant and was momentarily stunned, not knowing how to respond.

“But from this, it seems…” The middle-aged man nodded slightly. “You really aren’t from this world.”

Yang Kai took a deep breath, cupped his fists, and said, “Senior, your insight is as sharp as a torch. But… how did you…”

The middle-aged man smiled, and with a wave of his hand, a long sword suddenly appeared in his grasp. The sword glimmered with flowing light, its energy fluctuations extraordinary.

This longsword was not formed from Divine Soul power at all; it was genuine and tangible.

“Divine Soul Secret Treasure?” Yang Kai’s eyes nearly popped out. He could hardly believe what he was seeing.

In this Divine Roaming world, there was actually a cultivator who could take out a Divine Soul Secret Treasure—and not just any, but one of considerable grade. Judging by the fluctuations emanating from the sword, it had clearly reached the level of an Imperial Treasure. The blade was suffused with Imperial Might and Emperor Intent, perfectly complementing the middle-aged man’s own aura.

At the side, Yuan Fei and Bai Lu also stared intently at the sword, utterly entranced.

As trusted subordinates of the master of Heavenly Yao Mountain, the two naturally knew their lord possessed such a treasure, but even with their status, they rarely had the chance to see it.

In the past several hundred years, they had only seen it twice. Including today, this was the third time.

Yuan Fei and Bai Lu didn’t know what this treasure was or where it came from. They only knew it was incomparably sharp and powerful—far superior to any weapon they could form with their own Divine Soul power.

They couldn’t understand why their lord would show such a treasure to a human he was meeting for the first time like Yang Kai.

Moreover, what did their lord mean earlier by saying, “not from this world”?

They exchanged glances, each seeing the confusion in the other’s eyes.

“That’s right, this is a Divine Soul Secret Treasure.” The middle-aged man nodded, then ran his finger like a sword along the blade. Resonating with his energy, the sword vibrated and hummed, as if it possessed its own spirit.

“Eight hundred years ago, I obtained it from a fellow named Wen Zishan.” The middle-aged man smiled, closely watching Yang Kai’s expression as he spoke. “I wonder if you know him.”

“So it was Hall Master Wen…” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched, suddenly understanding.

According to Wen Zishan, eight hundred years ago was when he came to Qingyang Shrine, discovered the Divine Roaming Mirror, and stayed in the Qingyang Mountain Range.

At that time, Wen Zishan must have entered the Divine Roaming Mirror, traveled here, and met this middle-aged man. As for how the Secret Treasure ended up in his hands, Yang Kai had no way of knowing.

“He was quite an interesting fellow…” The middle-aged man’s face showed a trace of reminiscence. “We hit it off at first sight and had a great conversation. This sword, I won from him in a bet. But by your standards, at that time this Secret Treasure was only Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level. After several hundred years of my refining and nurturing, it finally advanced to Imperial Treasure.”

Yang Kai mused, “It seems Senior knows a lot about the outside world.”

The middle-aged man laughed heartily. “I got Wen Zishan drunk on a few jars of Monkey God Wine, and he nearly told me the color of his underwear. What do you think—do I know a lot or not?”

Yang Kai’s face twitched at these words. But with this, he was completely at ease. He no longer had to worry about his safety, because this middle-aged man bore him no ill will, knew Hall Master Wen, and was familiar with the outside world. For that reason alone, he would never harm him.

“May I ask Senior’s name?” Yang Kai straightened his expression and cupped his fists.

“This Lord is called Yi Quan!” the middle-aged man replied, putting away the Secret Treasure as he spoke. “I heard from Yuan Fei that you saved my son’s life outside?”

“It was just a coincidence,” Yang Kai answered honestly.

“Even so, it was a life-saving favor.” As Yi Quan spoke, he reached behind him and brought out a small figure.

Yang Kai looked closely and saw it was a child of about two years old, dressed in shorts and a short shirt, with a chubby, rosy face. His little hands and legs, exposed to the air, were as tender as white lotus roots.

It was a little boy, with a topknot tied high on his head, looking extremely cute.

“Little Purple Civet?” Yang Kai raised his brows at the sight.

The little fellow seemed a bit shy. After glancing at Yang Kai, he quickly hid behind Yi Quan, clutching his father’s clothes and peeking out.

Seeing this, Yang Kai was certain he was Purple Civet.

But now, he was clearly too embarrassed to approach Yang Kai as he had before.

“What did Daddy tell you?” Seeing this, Yi Quan patted Little Purple Civet on the back of the head, making him stumble out from behind.

Bai Lu, standing to the side, immediately looked distressed.

The little fellow pouted, on the verge of tears.

“Hmm?” Yi Quan grunted.

The sound startled Purple Civet, who quickly stifled his tears, sniffed, and looked at Yang Kai, babbling a few words.

“No need to thank me. You’ve helped me a lot too. If anything, I should be thanking you.” Yang Kai looked at the little one and spoke gently.

“A life-saving favor must be remembered for life, never to be forgotten!” Yi Quan said, stroking the child’s head with heartfelt earnestness. “Remember this!”

Purple Civet nodded vigorously.

“Bai Lu,” Yi Quan called.

“At your service,” Bai Lu quickly stepped forward.

“Take the Young Master out to play. Watch him carefully and don’t let him run off again. I have some things to discuss with this Young Brother.” Yi Quan instructed.

“Yes!” Bai Lu responded, then beckoned to the little one.

This time, he was very obedient, running over to Bai Lu and reaching out his hand to be led away. Before leaving, he looked back at Yang Kai, and Yuan Fei followed them out as well.

Once outside the hall, Yuan Fei quietly asked Bai Lu, “Did you understand what the lord meant?”

Bai Lu shook his head and looked at him. “Did you?”

Yuan Fei’s face darkened. “If you don’t understand, how could I? But… I vaguely remember that eight hundred years ago, a human came here, talked with the lord for three days and nights, and then left.”

“Yes, I remember too. That guy was very strong, not inferior to the lord at all.” Bai Lu nodded slightly.

“Strange, strange. What is a Divine Soul Secret Treasure? Why did the lord’s words seem to imply that the human boy just now also had one? But why don’t even strong experts like us know about it?”

“Why worry about it? If we were meant to know, the lord would tell us.” Bai Lu glared at him.

“True.” Yuan Fei nodded.

“Ya ya ya…” The little one being led by Bai Lu suddenly interjected.

Hearing this, Bai Lu exclaimed in surprise, “Young Master, are you saying that the boy named Yang Kai used a Divine Soul Secret Treasure in the earlier fight?”

“Ya ya ya!” The little one nodded vigorously.

“What did it look like? Tell us!” Yuan Fei immediately perked up and pressed for details.

But the little one glanced at him, snorted coldly, and turned his head away, clearly not interested in talking to him.
