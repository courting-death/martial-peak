## Chapter 1572 — Valuation

The two yao experts had quietly conspired with each other, deciding to strike once the pill was formed; in any case, they would seize that Spiritual Pill. A pill coveted even by an expert like Ba He could not be mediocre — it might even provide the chance to breakthrough to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and ascend to the Void King Realm.

After all, Ba He had reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm more than two hundred years ago; he was the most promising candidate on Yao Star Di Chen to one day rise to a lord-level existence.

While Magna and Mi Tian exchanged secret transmissions, Ba He casually cast a glance their way, a faint smile curling at the corner of his mouth.

"Young man, didn't you want to go to the palace to visit an old acquaintance?" Ba He suddenly transmitted to Yang Kai.

"Yes, sir… um, Elder Ba He, do you have any instructions?" Yang Kai looked at him warily, puzzled at why he brought up the matter.

"I don't claim to instruct you, but… I do have a method that can guarantee your safe entry into the palace!"

"Really?" Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

"Indeed! But this method is somewhat risky. If you trust me, I'll act; if you don't, just pretend I never said anything."

"Heh, we're mere acquaintances; whether I trust you or not is hardly worth mentioning." Yang Kai was no greenhorn who'd trust a stranger at once.

"Your hesitation is proper, yet to be frank… this plan carries risk even for me. If you join forces with me, I can promise this: so long as I live, nothing will befall you."

Yang Kai frowned slightly. After a moment's thought he asked, "Could you explain the details, Elder?"

"No problem." Ba He was straightforward and didn't toy with him; he candidly laid out his plan to Yang Kai.

After hearing this, Yang Kai furrowed his brows tightly. “There’s indeed some risk involved… but what a fine plan you’ve made, Senior. With a move like that, my Senior Sister and I would have no freedom left at all, would we?”

"So you refuse?" Ba He asked, a little disappointed.

"No. I accept. Do as you will, Elder." Yang Kai grinned broadly.

Ba He stared at him in astonishment, apparently not expecting such audacity from the human. In truth, his scheme was not likely to fail — he could ensure Yang Kai would be escorted into Lady Chi Yue's palace and treated with importance — yet this method might not be a good thing for Yang Kai or for the woman inside the inn who was refining pills.

He had prepared himself for refusal.

Yang Kai had accepted.

Ba He's expression was peculiar as he regarded Yang Kai; inwardly he thought the human was recklessly bold, but since he had agreed, Ba He had no further reservations.

Thinking that, Ba He smiled faintly and said, "This Spiritual Pill is already producing such a grand phenomenon before it's finished; it must be an exceptional pill. Judging by the fragrance's richness, it is likely at least Origin-Grade."

"Lord Ba He speaks sensibly," Magna agreed lightly, though he had no idea what trick Ba He intended.

"A pill like this, only the Lady could claim it. Magna, what do you think?" Ba He looked at him with a smile.

"Indeed!" Magna's brow furrowed deeper; a foreboding feeling rose in him.

"The alchemist crafting this Spiritual Pill must be a master of a sect."

"Mm." Magna nodded; the uneasy sense in his chest grew. He suddenly understood Ba He's intention.

"The lord has always favored humans with special talents. Over the years the palace has been recruiting talent. Now that such a talent has appeared in Huiyue City, Magna, you're fortunate. With your cleverness you surely know what to do next." Ba He said with a smile.

Magna's face turned solemn and he declared loudly, "Thanks for the guidance, Lord. I understand. Once this master finishes the pill, I'll escort him to the palace. The Lady will surely favor him!"

“If the Lady is pleased, you’ll be handsomely rewarded as well,” Ba He said with a chuckle.

At those words Magna's eyes lit up and he smiled all the more brightly, clasping his hands and saying, "All thanks to your patronage, Lord!"

After that he barked in a deep voice, "Guards!"

A group of yao experts responded in agreement.

"Clear out all idlers. Anyone who dares approach within fifty zhang of the inn is to be killed without mercy. Under no circumstances may anyone disturb the master's pill-refinement!"

"Yes!"

Mi Tian stood there dumbfounded.

The pact he had secretly made with Magna moments before was shattered by Ba He in a few words. Not only that, Magna had now completely sided with Ba He and even volunteered forces to protect the alchemist in the inn.

Ba He had no intention of monopolizing the Spiritual Pill; on the contrary, he seemed eager to have that master escorted into the palace.

Yao are not skilled at alchemy, as many knew; conversely, the weaker humans on Di Chen Star often produce masters adept at pillcraft. Lady Chi Yue grants humans a space to live and strictly prohibits wanton slaughter in her domain in order to protect those humans with special talents.

For example, alchemists, artificers, and the like…

Every ten years, on Lady Chi Yue's Domain there are competitions in alchemy and artificing; humans who rise to the top can shake off their lowly status and be received into the palace to serve the lord.

In recent years the palace has recruited widely, so an alchemy master capable of producing a phenomenon like this would undoubtedly be favored by Lady Chi Yue.

In other words, the master inside the inn already bore the sign of Lady Chi Yue's favor. Even if Mi Tian had the nerve, he would not dare oppose the Lady or the experts of the Red Moon Domain.

He was now merely a spectator…

Mi Tian felt sick as if he'd swallowed a dead fly.

Watching the numerous yao experts of Huiyue City surround the inn, Yang Kai chuckled.

He wasn't afraid of entering the palace; even if Lady Chi Yue was a Void King-Grade expert, so what? If given a chance, with his mastery of spatial techniques he could leave at will — and besides, he himself was an alchemy master!

His alchemical skill now surpassed Xia Ningshang's; he could refine Void King-Grade pills. If that ability leaked out, Lady Chi Yue would likely treat him as an honored guest!

After all, Void King-Grade alchemists are exceedingly rare across the Star Domain; they are unicorns, and none had appeared on Yao Star Di Chen before.

"Young man, I can only help you so far. How you act inside the palace depends on your own means. But let me warn you: if you wish to survive, don't be too reckless in the palace." Ba He looked at Yang Kai and transmitted quietly.

Yang Kai gave a noncommittal reply but asked with interest, "Elder Ba He, you exposed yourself this time not only to help my Senior Sister and the others, right? What is your purpose? If convenient, could you tell me?"

"Naturally it's not only to help you. I merely wish to use this opportunity to return to the palace and beg the Lady's forgiveness." A trace of melancholy flashed across Ba He's face.

Yang Kai's brow rose; he suddenly recalled the bystanders had said two hundred years ago Ba He was apparently slain by the Lady herself.

Yet for some reason he was alive today.

It seemed there was more between Ba He and Lady Chi Yue; the rumor was wrong — Ba He wasn't killed by her. Perhaps Lady Chi Yue spared him.

But this was other people's business, and he didn't care. He nodded and said, "If that's all, then we can cooperate. Everyone takes what they need."

"Ahem… besides returning to the palace, there's one more thing I'd like you to help me with." Ba He suddenly felt embarrassed.

"What is it?"

"I want to ask your Senior Sister to refine a pill for me!" Ba He blurted out, then hastily added, "Don't worry, I have gathered all the materials; just the refining is needed, and a generous reward will be given!"

"We'll discuss that later. It depends on my Senior Sister's mood; she might be willing to help." Yang Kai grinned.

This brat… really has the air of burning bridges after crossing them. Ba He couldn’t help but roll his eyes.

The celestial phenomenon in the sky intensified; as time passed the vortex obscured the heavens, and the congregating Spiritual Qi struck terror into onlookers.

Such an omen was no less magnificent than a martial artist's baptism when ascending to the Origin Returning Realm, perhaps even surpassed it.

No one had expected that mere pill refining could trigger such an event.

Everyone's curiosity deepened; they wanted to know what kind of pill the master inside was making.

From the thick medicinal aroma they were certain it would not be below Origin-Grade!

There were only a dozen or so Origin-Grade alchemists on Yao Star Di Chen; the most formidable among them was an Origin-Grade Upper-Level master whose reputation spread across Di Chen — though human, no yao dared disrespect him.

Humans were lowly on this cultivation star, but true talent was prized; the divide was stark.

All this was thanks to Lady Chi Yue's wise rule. Had she not sought out talented humans, the Red Moon Domain would not be so strong — among the ten territories of Di Chen, Red Moon Domain could easily rank in the top three.

One must remember that a millennium ago, the Red Moon Domain was the weakest territory on Di Chen Star.

To grow so in a thousand years, Lady Chi Yue deserves credit; it was easy to imagine that given time, Red Moon Domain might become the most powerful territory on Yao Star.

Unlike the surrounding yao who merely watched, Yang Kai, being an alchemist too, could judge Xia Ningshang's progress from the omen and the aroma. He kept vigilant over the changes, secretly anxious for Xia Ningshang.
