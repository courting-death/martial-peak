## Chapter 1390 — Two Become One

Although Yang Kai felt a storm of turmoil churning in his heart and his thoughts were in disarray, his face remained as calm as ever; he chatted with Yang Yan while probing for every scrap of information about the Great Emperor, for Yang Yan’s memories were only slowly returning, and as a Soul Incarnation she must be bewildered—if Yang Kai failed to keep his composure, he would only make matters worse.

The only thing Yang Kai could not make sense of was why the Great Emperor would choose to sleep on the Dark Star; the world laws here restricted martial artists from advancing to the Void King Realm—could that be connected to her?

After a long conversation, Yang Kai learned that the place where the Great Emperor slept was actually inside the Imperial Garden.

This reminded him of something.

It was what Fei Zhi Tu had once said: in one of the palaces of the Imperial Garden a jade coffin had been found, and within that coffin lay a person who, from their form, appeared to be a woman.

At the time, Fei Zhi Tu and the others had triggered the seals near the jade coffin, which caused the Imperial Garden to burst forth and allowed Yang Kai, Qian Tong and the others to escape.

If that was true, then the woman lying in the jade coffin would be the Great Emperor in the flesh? That such a terrifying expert could be sleeping on this backward, sealed Dark Star was something Yang Kai found almost impossible to accept.

He stole a furtive glance at Yang Yan while lost in thought, and could not, no matter how he tried, connect her with the Great Emperor who had once dominated an entire Star Domain and the Starry Sky.

“Let’s go.” Yang Yan stared at the Taixuan Sect ruins in the mist for a long while, then said with waning interest.

“Not go in and have a look?”

“No.” Yang Yan slowly shook her head, took a light step and moved forward.

“Where are we going now?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

“To the Sixth Layer, to fetch something.” Yang Yan smiled slightly and gave no further explanation.

The Sixth Layer—wasn’t that where the pavilion was? Back then he had found the Ten-Thousand-Year Incense there; it seemed that incense must have once belonged to the Great Emperor, in other words, it was Yang Yan’s.

Yang Kai sniffed lightly. There was nothing awkward about it—after all, to him, whatever belonged to Yang Yan was essentially his as well, so there was no need for any sense of formality between them.

Their pace was not fast, but with Yang Yan leading the way, any danger within the Flowing Flame Sandland kept its distance; the two of them soon reached the Heat-Flame Zone of the Fifth Stage. As when they had passed the Third Stage before, the omnipresent heat waves seemed to have a life of their own, parting aside to reveal a path straight to the Sixth Stage.

A soft chirp came from Yang Kai’s body as the Fire Bird’s Artifact Spirit appeared of its own accord.

It beat its wings and circled above Yang Kai’s head, transmitting a faint thought. Yang Kai smiled slightly; having seen through its intention, he did not stop it but waved his hand and let it be.

The Artifact Spirit cried out joyfully, immediately transforming into a streak of flame and flying off, vanishing in the blink of an eye. From its direction it was heading straight for the Earth Lung Fire Vein.

The Earth Lung Fire Vein was the source from which the Artifact Spirit had been born; although it had remained there for tens of thousands of years, its growth had been limited and it could not draw much more power—yet now it was different. Having undergone the baptism and fusion of several strands of Sun’s True Fire, the Fire Bird’s Artifact Spirit was far stronger than when Yang Kai had first acquired it.

Now it wanted to go to the Earth Lung Fire Vein to devour the pure fire there and strengthen itself.

Such a good thing—what reason did Yang Kai have to stop it?

In the span of half a day the two of them passed through the Fifth Layer's Heat-Flame Zone and arrived before the exquisite pavilion hidden in the bamboo grove.

Gazing at the modest pavilion, a trace of nostalgia flickered in Yang Yan’s beautiful eyes as memories rolled over and she savored them; Yang Kai made no sound to disturb her and stood before the bamboo grove, halting.

These bamboos were extraordinarily hard. Back then Yang Kai had spent half a year in this place, using his Space Blade to cut down only a little more than twenty stalks—now the stumps looked as if they had just been cut, and past events were vivid in his mind.

“These are Golden Crow Bamboo. Although they make excellent material for forging sword-shaped Secret Treasures, that is of little importance compared to their other use—don’t touch them.” Yang Yan’s voice came from nearby.

“Another use?” Yang Kai was astonished; he had personally experienced how hard these bamboos were and naturally knew they were no ordinary forging material.

“Yes. When Golden Crow Bamboo blooms it produces Golden Crow Bamboo Rice, the most refined source of energy in the world, which any martial artist can consume to absorb without danger and thus elevate their cultivation.”

Yang Kai’s expression flickered. “There’s such a thing?”

“Why would I lie to you?” Yang Yan scolded him with a glance.

“When will it bloom and produce bamboo rice?” Yang Kai asked eagerly.

“Soon, perhaps in no more than ten or twenty years.” Yang Yan pursed her lips and smiled slightly; she knew what he was thinking.

“Ten or twenty years…” Yang Kai’s face darkened; who could say what would happen in ten or twenty years? He might not even still be on the Dark Star by then.

Yang Yan gave a light laugh and paid him no more heed, stepping into the pavilion; Yang Kai sighed in frustration and hurried after her.

Upon entering the pavilion’s first level, the first thing to catch the eye was a hanging scroll directly ahead; there was no other image on the scroll, only the silhouette of a woman. When Yang Kai had first come here he had also studied the painting, but no matter how he examined it there had seemed to be nothing unusual—just a common scene with no energy fluctuations.

Back then Yang Kai had only felt the silhouette was vaguely familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere before.

Now, seeing it again, everything snapped into place and his mind understood.

That silhouette was identical to Yang Yan’s!

It was only that Yang Yan had long worn a wide black robe, which had kept Yang Kai from recalling at first; but now Yang Yan herself stood before the scroll, staring blankly—placed side by side the likeness could not be missed.

As he thought this, the scroll seemed to be stirred by a soft breeze and trembled slightly, and then an incredible scene occurred.

The silhouette on the scroll slowly turned, the beautiful eyes meeting Yang Yan’s with a smile curling at the lips.

Yang Kai stared in astonishment, frozen in place.

When the woman on the scroll turned, she was exactly Yang Yan’s likeness, with no difference—only their garments were not the same: Yang Yan wore black robes, while the woman on the scroll was dressed in white, appearing pure and radiant.

The eerie sight was like Yang Yan standing before a mirror, and it sent a chill through Yang Kai’s heart.

What shocked him further was that the woman on the scroll actually glanced toward him, as if she possessed life and consciousness.

If Yang Kai had retained even a shred of doubt about Yang Yan’s identity before, all uncertainty vanished now; even ignoring other matters, the peculiarity of the scroll left Yang Kai unable to fathom things.

The two—person and portrait—regarded each other for a long while before Yang Yan suddenly sighed softly: “Now that I have awakened, you need not remain here and keep vigil; come forth, you have suffered all these years.”

“I am you, you are me—why be so distant?” The voice from within the scroll was identical to Yang Yan’s. Then the woman on the scroll smiled, her delicate form shimmering, and she transformed into a stream of light that darted out and entered above Yang Yan’s head, disappearing.

Yang Yan’s body trembled and a flicker of pain crossed her face, but she quickly steadied herself, closed her eyes, and seemed to be sensing something.

Yang Kai remained silent, for everything he had seen on this trip to the Flowing Flame Sandland with Yang Yan far exceeded his comprehension—the methods of the Great Emperor were beyond a martial artist of his caliber.

And as the portrait of the Great Emperor faded from the scroll, it suddenly caught fire without any flame. In just a brief moment, it vanished completely from the world.

Yang Yan still had her eyes closed, quietly sensing something. Yang Kai did not make a sound to disturb her, merely waiting silently at her side.

About two hours later Yang Yan suddenly exhaled and slowly opened her beautiful eyes, turning to Yang Kai with a smile.

Although Yang Kai still could not measure Yang Yan’s cultivation, he felt that upon receiving the portrait’s image her aura had changed somewhat; she seemed stronger.

“This was a hidden move left by the Great Emperor,” Yang Yan explained softly. “Had I not appeared in time, it would have taken effect.”

“What effect?”

“To awaken the Great Emperor!” Yang Yan replied slowly. “You should count yourself lucky you are not a woman; if you had been, when you penetrated this place in the past you would have already been usurped.”

Yang Kai rolled his eyes speechlessly, but soon grew suspicious again: “You mean you now bear the task of awakening the Great Emperor?”

“Yes.” Yang Yan nodded.

“How is she to be awakened?”

“When the Imperial Garden opens, enter it and go deep inside.” Yang Yan looked up toward where the Imperial Garden lay, but the Flowing Flame Sandland’s heat veil had sealed the sky and blocked the view, making it impossible to see the outside world.

Yang Kai asked no more; sometimes knowing too much is not a blessing.

“With this matter done, let us return.” Yang Yan said with satisfaction.

“All right, wait a moment.” Yang Kai nodded, and in his heart sent out a command, then stood waiting.

A moment later a streak of flame rapidly flew in from afar—the Fire Bird’s Artifact Spirit returning.

In the blink of an eye the Artifact Spirit rushed before Yang Kai, its flames raging, the Blazing Flame roaring.

It seemed that despite the brief time, the Artifact Spirit had indeed gained much from the Earth Lung Fire Vein. Summoned back by Yang Kai, the spirit remained reluctant to leave and cried out repeatedly.

Yang Kai beckoned with his hand and the Artifact Spirit obediently merged back into his body.

The two then stepped out side by side.

To avoid being seen, they proceeded with great caution; fortunately the emergence of the Imperial Garden had drawn the attention of most martial artists, and few had come to the Flowing Flame Sandland to investigate, so after a period of concealment they managed to leave without incident.

Once outside that forbidden place, Yang Yan immediately summoned the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle and sped toward Tianyun City.
