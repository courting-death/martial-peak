## Chapter 1582 — The Jiao Transformation

This alone would be forgivable, but the most terrifying thing was Yang Kai's momentum; as the battle progressed his aura grew ever stronger, and the fists he swung became more and more powerful — Xue Lian, caught in the whirl of combat, felt this clearly.

After contending with him for no more than the time of a tea, the other side, whose strength had been matched with his, actually began to suppress him.

What is going on? Could it be that he had not been using his full strength all along?

Xue Lian's expression grew increasingly grave, his face taking on a crazed excitement.

He was a favored child of heaven, a dazzling rising star on Di Chen Star; he did not fear strong opponents. The madness in his blood yearned for battle — only by slaughtering the powerful could he demonstrate his might!

He had finally taken an interest in Yang Kai!

"Yu Xiong, what is going on?" A hundred zhang from the battlefield, standing on the palace roof, Shan Qingluo suddenly arrived, brows knit as she anxiously watched the struggle below.

With such noise coming from here, how could she not notice? Realizing the disturbance was coming from Xia Ningshang's pavilion, she had immediately come and arrived just in time to see Yang Kai and Xue Lian locked in a bloody struggle.

"How did Yang Kai get into a fight with Xue Lian? Didn't Xue Lian only arrive a few days ago?" Shan Qingluo frowned. If it had been Yang Kai fighting Mi Tian, she could understand — there had long been friction between them; Yang Kai had killed Mi Tian's two Ninth-Tier demonic beasts, and with Mi Tian's temperament he would never let it drop.

But Yang Kai and Xue Lian had clearly never met before. They had no deep hatred; why were they fighting to the death down there?

"I don't know." Yu Xiong shrank back, hurriedly waving his hands to show it was not his doing, yet the flicker in his eyes revealed a clue to Shan Qingluo.

"You really don't know?" Shan Qingluo narrowed her eyes and looked toward Yu Xiong with a cold gleam in her beautiful gaze.

"Ahem... I really don't know..."

"I'll ask you one last time — what exactly is going on!" Shan Qingluo ground her teeth and cried out in a harsh, clear scold.

Yu Xiong's face instantly turned into that of a bitter melon; he looked at Shan Qingluo pitifully, his mouth working in silent protest. He had no answer.

"Of course. It was your doing!" Shan Qingluo was about to blow a gasket, her bosom heaving. Xue Lian was no ordinary yao — if Yang Kai and he fought, win or lose there would be no good outcome.

Realizing it had been Yu Xiong's plot, Shan Qingluo wished she could tear her cheap Eldest Brother to pieces to vent her hatred.

"I didn't do much..." Yu Xiong scratched his head awkwardly. "Xue Lian only just arrived at the palace these few days. I merely boasted in front of him and Mi Tian about how outstanding Master Xia's pill-refining skills were, and Xue Lian happened to need some pills refined, so..."

Shan Qingluo said nothing, glaring at Yu Xiong through clenched teeth.

"It's not Eldest Brother's fault; I originally wanted to egg Mi Tian into acting, but that wretch was too sly and let Xue Lian take the lead. Hmm, come to think of it, this is partly your fault."

"My fault?" Shan Qingluo shrieked, her anger mounting.

Yu Xiong grew uneasy and whispered, "If you hadn't stopped Eldest Brother from taking action personally... it was our foster mother's orders to gauge that kid's depth. Eldest Brother thought for three days and nights before coming up with this bright idea! If you'd let Eldest Brother act sooner, I would've been more careful — I wouldn't have hurt the kid; after all, he's my brother-in-law, hahaha!"

"So it really is my fault then?" Shan Qingluo smiled faintly and bit her pearly teeth playfully.

"Not at all, it's Eldest Brother's fault." Yu Xiong readily accepted the blame; he knew if he kept arguing, it would end badly, so he chose to be a bit humble to win his Little Sister's forgiveness.

"If anything happens to my man, you're a dead!" Shan Qingluo snarled low through her teeth.

“Ah, concern leads to chaos, Miss Qing Luo!” At that moment, a voice suddenly came from the side.

Shan Qingluo and Yu Xiong both startled and turned toward the sound, only to find Ba He had come over without them noticing, standing not far away.

Worthy indeed of being the strongest below the Void King Realm on Di Chen Star! It seems that after concealing his identity for two hundred years, not only has his cultivation not regressed, but it has become even more profound!

Yu Xiong and Shan Qingluo respectfully bowed.

“Senior, those words just now… do they mean that you favor Yang Kai?” Shan Qingluo’s beautiful eyes shimmered as she looked toward Ba He, her expression filled with excitement.

Although she herself cultivated to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and was not far behind Ba He, she admitted her eyesight could not compare, so Ba He's words reassured her.

Ba He chuckled: "I did not say that exactly, only that... he is indeed no easy opponent. Xue Lian probably can't put him down — well, at his current state."

After speaking he sighed, "Amazing, simply amazing — the young people nowadays. This kid is only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, yet he can force Xue Lian like this. If he really reaches the Third Stage, Xue Lian would definitely be no match!"

Shan Qingluo's expression brightened and pride rose within her.

This was the man she had chosen — truly extraordinary.

Back when he was in Zhongdu, even with his weak cultivation he had raised storms and created miracles; decades later, he seemed even more remarkable than before!

Xue Lian was not an ordinary yao expert — he had a distinguished background and was a top existence at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

A strange light bloomed in Shan Qingluo's eyes and she felt proud, as if anything Yang Kai did, however incredible, was perfectly natural.

"Senior, when you said Xue Lian couldn't take him at his current state, did you mean that?" Yu Xiong caught another meaning in Ba He's words.

"Yes, Xue Lian hasn't used his full strength; you should be able to see it — the latent power of the Blood Jiao line hasn't been awakened yet." Ba He smiled and explained.

Hearing this, Shan Qingluo's pretty face darkened as she suddenly realized the issue.

Yu Xiong glanced cautiously at Shan Qingluo and asked softly, "Then, Senior, if Xue Lian goes all out, can my brother-in-law hold him off?"

"I don't know." Ba He smiled faintly. "I don't know this fellow's full background. If he's only got these skills, he likely can't withstand it. If he has other means, it's uncertain. But from the standpoint of pure physical strength, Xue Lian has the advantage."

"Yes. I think so too." Yu Xiong nodded in agreement.

Still, for a human one realm lower to fight Xue Lian to such a degree was itself something to be proud of.

The task given by their foster mother seemed to be perfectly fulfilled. With such a performance, foster mother should approve of him — though his womanizing is a problem; their foster mother would never allow her Little Sister to share a man with others.

"Little Sister, don't worry. If necessary, Eldest Brother will go down and separate them himself." Yu Xiong switched tone to comfort.

Shan Qingluo glared at him fiercely while Yu Xiong gave an awkward laugh.

"Eh — golden blood?" Ba He suddenly cried out in surprise, his eyes fixed on Yang Kai with disbelief.

He had discovered that the blood flowing from Yang Kai's wound was faintly golden in color...

This was not the color a human's blood should be; could he truly possess an extraordinary bloodline that allowed him to match Xue Lian in flesh-and-blood strength?

But what bloodline could produce golden blood?

That faintly golden, shimmering blood seemed to contain an immensely surging force of qi and blood and vitality; upon appearing it began repairing Yang Kai's wounds — the split flesh and blood were restored in the blink of an eye.

Such powerful regenerative ability stunned Ba He; he leaned forward involuntarily, wanting to see more clearly.

A hundred zhang away, the bloody battle continued.

Yang Kai and Xue Lian were drenched in blood, the pale gold and red colors intermingling and staining them both.

Boom, boom, boom...

Dense thunderous explosions suddenly rang from the point of violent contact, and amid the blasts Yang Kai and Xue Lian separated.

Both men's eyes were as sharp and unwavering as hawks', paying no heed to their wounds as they coldly stared at each other.

"Human, you truly are remarkable. I take back my earlier boast — you are a fine opponent!" Xue Lian drew a deep breath and shouted in a deep voice.

“Is that so!” Yang Kai grinned. “But you don’t seem to be doing too well yourself.”

Xue Lian laughed aloud. "How arrogant! I haven't met a human like you in ages. The last one who spoke to me like that I tore apart alive. I hope you last longer so I can enjoy it!"

As he spoke, crimson blood seeped from his exposed skin, and as the blood appeared it turned into a mist that wrapped around him.

It intensified his already violent, sinister aura by another degree.

In an instant Xue Lian became like a man made of blood — his entire body crimson, terrifyingly gruesome.

The blood mist writhed on him and suddenly became scales that covered his flesh like armor.

At the same time, two crimson curved horns sprouted from his forehead, making him look majestic and utterly domineering.

"The Jiao Transformation!" Ba He said in a low voice, his expression serious.

Shan Qingluo's face tightened with tension and Yu Xiong's expression grew solemn.

Xue Lian was the son of the Blood Jiao Lord and bore the Blood Jiao lineage; he represented the strongest yao lineage on Di Chen Star, a fact every yao must acknowledge.

With the Jiao Transformation, Xue Lian's power would at least surge by around thirty percent — this was a secret art possessed by the Blood Jiao line.

Most great yao possessed such secret arts, though how much potential could be awakened varied with their bloodline.

Now Xue Lian's momentum was like night and day compared to before; that fierce, surging aura radiated from him in all directions, an invisible shock that made the heavens and earth tremble.

His blood seemed to boil and burn; a red qi wrapped him, the vapor shifting like flames as it rose, making him truly look like a burning orb.

Xue Lian was about to go all out!
