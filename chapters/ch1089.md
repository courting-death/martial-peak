## Chapter 1089 — Body Tempering Divine Pool

Listening to the four of them bicker, Yang Kai finally understood: the so-called Thunder Luan was nothing more than a Tenth-Tier flying demonic beast, extremely rare in number; when it dies, its blood, flesh, and inner core transmute into nutrients that sprout an Avian Tree.

Avian Trees only form where very powerful flying demonic beasts die, and even then the odds are slim — ten thousand deaths of high-grade flying demonic beasts might still fail to give birth to a single Avian Tree; the right time and place are both indispensable.

Each Avian Tree has distinct properties, wholly determined by the attribute of the flying demonic beast that birthed it.

The Thunder Luan was a thunder-attribute demonic beast, so the Avian Tree spawned from it was naturally thunder-attribute as well.

The others were resentful that Ji Ping had hidden the Thunder Luan's existence from them, and Guiche even vowed to settle accounts with him later, but the tremendous value of this Avian Tree still stirred everyone's avarice.

Apart from Yang Kai, who picked up a few herbs and other minor gains, the others had profited handsomely from the expedition; now a thunder-attribute Avian Tree stood before them — born from a Tenth-Tier Thunder Luan — and their joy and excitement left them no time to dwell on Ji Ping's slight.

They all set to digging, turning over the surrounding earth.

A hidden glint of coldness flashed in Ji Ping's eyes; Yang Kai turned his head away to feign ignorance but helped with the digging at the side.

Before long, a huge pit opened up, and within it was a skeletal frame over a hundred zhang in length; from the bones it was unmistakably a flying demonic beast, but its flesh had long since vanished and its inner core was nowhere to be seen; even the bones had decayed to dust at a touch.

All of the Tenth-Tier Thunder Luan's energy had been transferred into that Avian Tree.

Guiche circulated his Saint Yuan, guarding his body as he carefully uprooted the waist-high Avian Tree without damaging its rootstock.

Seeing him about to slip such a treasure into his Spatial Ring, the other three protested loudly.

Guiche ignored them and forcefully took the Avian Tree as his own; though he promised they would divide it after leaving, everyone could plainly see he intended to monopolize it.

The once cheerful mood turned awkward. Yang Kai stayed aloof and guessed that if there weren't greater rewards ahead, the other three would have attacked Guiche without hesitation.

But their final destination was not far; they had to restrain their anger and wait until they had taken the last benefits before acting.

The group's atmosphere was tense and strange. Yang Kai trailed silently at the back, inconspicuous.

The further they walked, the more desolate the land became.

From the area where the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion had been, the earth grew barren; soil that should have teemed with life was suddenly lifeless, and even the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth dwindled to nothing.

One day as they traveled, a bizarre energy fluctuation rose ahead; at the same time, everyone's blood began to surge uncontrollably, flushing all five of them red-faced. The stirring of their blood made them excited and violent; their eyes reddened and their breathing grew coarse.

"Found it!" Ji Ping cried out and, without hesitation, guided his Star Shuttle toward the source of the energy. The others, unwilling to be left behind, followed close.

The strange energy grew ever stronger, further stoking the blood's flow; Yang Kai could even hear his heart pounding violently within his chest.

This was abnormal and Yang Kai immediately became alert.

In moments they hovered above a hollow filled with scarlet liquid that looked like thick blood; under the sunlight it shimmered with ripples, making the vast area appear both eerie and beautiful.

"The Body Tempering Divine Pool?" Guiche turned to Ji Ping.

Ji Ping nodded heavily, his eyes shining with joy.

"How is it used?" Ganji asked anxiously; they had suffered much on the road and paid heavy costs to find this pool; now that they were close, he couldn't wait to temper his body and harden his flesh.

After all, this was a warrior's foundation; the various gains along the way paled before such fundamental improvement.

"No particular method," Ji Ping laughed, and was the first to leap into the blood-red pool. Water splashed everywhere; only his head remained above the surface as he groaned, as if enduring some pain.

But soon that pain vanished and was replaced by boundless joy; his face was filled with delight as his body seemed greatly nourished, and the aura of the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm burst outward.

Anyone could sense his qi and blood power rising rapidly.

Guiche, Ganji, and Luo Yao had been wary, fearing Ji Ping might be hiding something in this final moment, but seeing him jump in so recklessly they no longer hesitated, lest he take all the benefits alone; they too plunged into the so-called Tempering Pool.

The pool was not large — roughly thirty zhang across — and whatever profundity it held, the three who entered immediately displayed joyous expressions.

Yang Kai remained at the edge. Ji Ping opened his eyes to glance at him and shouted, "Kid, go to the outer edge — you can't withstand being in the center."

"I can go in too?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

Ji Ping laughed, "I told you when we came; cooperate and you'll gain your share. I keep my word."

Yang Kai frowned, reluctant to rashly enter, but knowing he couldn't refuse, he obeyed Ji Ping's words and took his place at the very edge of the pool.

The moment he entered, Yang Kai's expression changed.

From every direction, fierce pressure assaulted him, causing intense pain as if his internal organs had been struck; his face turned pale.

Yet in the next moment the pain vanished and was replaced by endless comfort.

Mysterious forces seeped from the pool into his body; under their influence Yang Kai clearly felt subtle changes in his blood.

Like Ji Ping, his qi and blood power rose and his vitality strengthened.

Yang Kai calmed his mind and examined himself.

Saint Yuan flowed swiftly through his meridians; golden blood swelled in his vessels as the incoming power was absorbed by his blood.

A wondrous thing occurred: among his pale-golden blood a purer point of golden blood appeared — only the tip of a needle in size — yet within that speck surged densely packed flesh-essence and unimaginable energy.

Yang Kai stood dumbfounded.

That newly birthed speck resembled the blood of a Great Demon God and was nearly indistinguishable from it.

Owing to his Indomitable Golden Body, Yang Kai's blood had been slowly turning golden over the years; at first the change was slight, with red mingled with faint gold when he bled from wounds.

But as his cultivation rose, the golden radiance gradually overlaid the red.

In recent years his blood had no longer shown red at all, only flashing golden light.

Yet he knew better than anyone that his golden blood, though possessing strong regenerative power, still lagged behind the Demon God Golden Blood by several grades.

He did not know how to refine his golden blood to greater purity and strength; he could only train and raise his realm, hoping his blood would follow and become more refined.

This time, joining Ji Ping and the others in the Tempering Pool had brought him an unexpected gain.

Yang Kai realized in an instant that the Tempering Pool did not temper the flesh itself but the cultivator's blood; tempered blood increases qi-and-blood power and likewise solidifies the body — Ji Ping had likely misunderstood the pool's true function.

Such tempering was superior and more thorough than simply tempering the flesh.

With that thought he ceased hesitating and opened himself to the strange force pouring in from all directions; his mind watched the needle-sized golden speck grow into the size of a grain of rice, then a soybean.

At last a drop of new golden blood took form, and perceiving its uniqueness Yang Kai was moved.

The power contained within that drop was incomparable to his previous golden blood — orders of magnitude stronger — this was genuine Demon God Golden Blood.

Another drop slowly formed, undergoing the same transformation.

In the span of an hour three new drops of golden blood had formed within Yang Kai; he didn't know how much benefit the others had gained, but it surely wasn't less than his.

Just as he savored the sweetness of it, Ganji's startled shout came from his ear, "Where's Ji Ping?"

The cry snapped everyone out of their blissful absorption; they looked around and indeed Ji Ping was nowhere to be seen.

Yang Kai's face darkened; he quickly released his Divine Sense and soon detected Ji Ping's life aura at the very bottom of the pool.

"I knew something was wrong!" Guiche roared and dove down swiftly, intent on investigating what trick Ji Ping was playing.

No sooner had he disappeared than Ji Ping shot out from the pool, wet and hovering leisurely in midair, looking at them with satisfaction.

A scheming, triumphant smile covered his face.

Yang Kai immediately tried to leap from the pool, but before he could act an immense pulling force seized his ankle as if gripped by two invisible hands, immobilizing him.

Simultaneously the blood-red water foamed with bubbles that burst incessantly; far fiercer and more bizarre power than before seeped forth from the pool and violently surged into everyone's bodies.

The newly formed drop of Demon God Golden Blood in Yang Kai's body swelled at an incredible speed and quickly took shape.
