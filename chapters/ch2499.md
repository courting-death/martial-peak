## Chapter 2499 — Under Heaven and Earth, All Living Beings Are but Ants

Time passed slowly as the Golden Sacred Dragon continuously devoured the power of heaven and earth, and Yang Kai’s strength steadily grew. As one waxed and the other waned, the might of heaven and earth became increasingly feeble.

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the heavenly phenomenon above Yang Kai’s head vanished, returning everything to calm.

The thunder and lightning were gone, and the spectacle of clouds pressing down as if the sky were collapsing had disappeared without a trace.

All the Spiritual Qi and Heaven-and-Earth Energy in the surroundings vanished without a trace, completely absorbed into Yang Kai’s body. Though he remained motionless, the bones within him crackled and popped with explosive joy, as if celebrating his breakthrough.

This time, it seemed his advancement had passed peacefully.

Wu Kuang and Duan Hongchen both stared in stunned silence, lost for a long time, utterly astonished.

Yet Yang Kai felt no joy at all. On the contrary, a faint sense of dread welled up in his heart, even stronger than when he was advancing just moments ago, as if something truly terrifying was about to happen.

He could clearly sense that his realm had not truly reached the Emperor Realm, but was lingering just outside its threshold, only a single step away.

What was going on?

The heavenly phenomenon from his advancement had vanished, and he had endured the terrifying baptism of the Heaven-and-Earth Energy. Why had he still not advanced to the Emperor Realm? As Yang Kai puzzled over this, his unease grew ever stronger.

Suddenly, a vast and majestic aura sprang forth from the world itself, transforming into a stream of light that shot straight down toward the top of Yang Kai’s head, swift as thunder.

Yang Kai’s expression changed dramatically. Faced with this grand and mighty aura, he felt utterly powerless to resist, as if once that stream of light descended, he would be annihilated.

Moreover, the aura descending upon him felt both familiar and strange, as if he had glimpsed it somewhere before.

“The Great Might of Heaven and Earth!” Wu Kuang and Duan Hongchen cried out in unison, their eyes wide as they stared at Yang Kai. In that instant, the hearts of the two Great Emperors were thrown into turmoil. They had no idea what Yang Kai had done to provoke the Great Might of Heaven and Earth during his breakthrough to the Emperor Realm.

The Great Might of Heaven and Earth was an extremely special and wondrous power, even more profound and mysterious than Laws or Origins.

The Great Emperors were all masters of countless Laws, able to wield Origin Power with a mere thought, effortlessly bending the World Laws to their will in battle. Yet none dared underestimate the Great Might of Heaven and Earth.

That was the power of the world itself.

Under heaven and earth, all living beings are but ants. If heaven and earth wish you to live, you live; if they wish you to die, you die. Even someone like the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor could not fully control the Great Might of Heaven and Earth. That was why Duan Hongchen had been able to secretly injure him earlier.

For tens of thousands of years, Duan Hongchen had repeatedly severed his own cultivation, wandering the path of Martial Dao in endless cycles, struggling through the mortal world. In doing so, he gained insight into the power of the mortal world, which also counted as a form of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, and so could harm the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor.

Even so, Duan Hongchen’s power of the mortal world could not compare to the true Great Might of Heaven and Earth.

When the Great Might of Heaven and Earth appears, it is the will of the world itself! No one can defy it.

That brat is doomed! The two Great Emperors had thought they were witnessing the birth of a prodigy, but never expected such an ending. They could not help but sigh; under the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, how could Yang Kai possibly resist?

The Golden Sacred Dragon’s phantom raised its head and roared, soaring into the sky, intent on battling heaven and earth.

As the stream of light crashed down, the Golden Dragon’s phantom shattered in an instant, scattering to nothing. Without losing any momentum, the light surged straight for the crown of Yang Kai’s head.

Yang Kai looked up, his gaze icy and clear.

Only in the surging tides of the sea does a true hero reveal his colors. In this moment of crisis, Yang Kai’s mind suddenly became incomparably clear, and his entire being grew impossibly calm.

With a flick of his finger, the Mountain and River Bell was suddenly summoned. The ancient bell expanded in the wind, growing as large as a house, and the intricate patterns and designs upon it seemed to come alive, flowing vividly.

A suppressive aura that could subdue heaven and earth erupted forth!

“Mountain and River Bell!” Duan Hongchen’s eyes widened in shock, his face pale as he exclaimed, “Mountain and River Bell, that’s Origin Cauldron’s Mountain and River Bell!”

Wu Kuang’s eyes blazed with ghostly fire, so startled he forgot his struggle with Duan Hongchen, staring fixedly in Yang Kai’s direction, his gaze both shocked and burning with desire.

From Yang Kai’s advancement to the Emperor Realm until now, the depth of his foundation and the means he displayed had stunned the two Great Emperors to their core. In the past, neither could have imagined one person possessing so many treasures.

The Golden Sacred Dragon was said to be the ancestor of the Dragon Clan, long since vanished into dust and legend—yet its Origin Power now resided within Yang Kai. The Mountain and River Bell, once the prized treasure of the Primordial Era, was a relic coveted even by Great Emperors. In the ancient struggle between the Emperors, Origin Cauldron had exhausted his final strength to cast the bell into the void, where it disappeared without a trace. Now, that very bell shone with a mysterious brilliance in Yang Kai’s hands.

Just who was this brat, to be so favored by heaven and earth?

With this, the two Great Emperors finally understood why his advancement to Emperor had drawn the attention of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth.

In his growth, he must have encountered endless opportunities and blessings. Yet the way of heaven is fair and impartial; on the path of Martial Dao, gain always comes with loss. The greater the opportunities and talent a martial artist possesses, the greater the resistance they face when advancing. The two are directly proportional.

No one can explain why, but throughout history, there has never been an exception.

If someone possessed both the Golden Sacred Dragon’s Origin Power and the Mountain and River Bell, and still did not draw the attention of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, it would be truly absurd.

Realizing this, the two Great Emperors felt no more regret for Yang Kai, for the tribulation he faced was inevitable. Even if it did not come now, it would descend upon him in the future. It was only a matter of time, and utterly unavoidable.

The earlier baptism of heaven and earth’s power was just an appetizer; this strike of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth was the true ordeal.

If he could endure it, Yang Kai would soar to the heavens. If not, he would be annihilated, and nothing more could be said.

“Wu Kuang, you’ve seen much in your life. Do you think he can survive?” Duan Hongchen asked, swallowing nervously.

Wu Kuang’s throat bobbed, but as a skeleton, he had no saliva to swallow. He replied calmly, “Mountain and River Bell, its chime suppresses mountains and rivers, its Imperial Aura reverses the heavens. Of all the Emperors back then, I admired you most, but the one I feared most was Origin Cauldron! Because he had the Mountain and River Bell!”

“So that’s why you risked everything to cripple him first?”

Wu Kuang snorted, “This Lord wanted to kill him, but you all interfered and ruined my plans!”

“That was long ago. Let’s change the subject,” Duan Hongchen chuckled.

Wu Kuang said, “If Origin Cauldron himself were wielding the Mountain and River Bell, this strike of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth would be nothing. The bell can suppress the power of heaven and earth; it is the nemesis of the Great Might of Heaven and Earth. But that brat… how much of the bell’s power can he truly unleash?”

Duan Hongchen said gravely, “So you think he’s doomed?”

Wu Kuang replied, “It’s hard to survive!”

Duan Hongchen’s eyes flickered, “Then how about we make a bet?”

“What bet? What are the stakes?” Wu Kuang asked in a low voice.

Duan Hongchen pointed, “Let’s bet on whether he lives!”

“If he lives, what then? If he dies, what then?”

“If he dies, I’ll cut my own throat before you and self-destruct my Divine Soul. If he lives, you must do the same!”

At those words, Wu Kuang’s face changed dramatically, and he shouted, “Duan Hongchen, do you want so badly to see me dead that you’d wager your own life?”

Duan Hongchen said solemnly, “I’ve said it already. Today, even if my Divine Soul is destroyed, I’ll drag you down with me! If I don’t care about my life, what is there to fear?”

Wu Kuang’s eyes flickered constantly, clearly furious.

“Afraid?” Duan Hongchen sneered, glancing sideways at him.

“Don’t try to provoke this Lord!” Wu Kuang snorted. “Since birth, this Lord has never feared anything.”

“So you agree?”

Wu Kuang snorted, “My life is mine to control. No one else can decide it!”

Duan Hongchen laughed heartily, “Wu Kuang, oh Wu Kuang, I never thought you’d become so cautious. It seems that after tens of thousands of years of sleep, you’ve changed a lot. The old you would never have said that.”

“And what would the old me have said?” Wu Kuang asked coldly.

Duan Hongchen replied, “The old you would have agreed immediately, then secretly used some trick to kill that brat.”

“In your eyes, am I really that despicable?” Wu Kuang snorted.

“Whether you’re despicable or not, you know best. Why ask me?”

As the two Great Emperors spoke, the stream of light formed by the Great Might of Heaven and Earth was already very close to Yang Kai. Yet after he summoned the Mountain and River Bell, its descent slowed dramatically.

The suppressive aura of the Mountain and River Bell seemed to have a tremendous effect on it.

Even so, Yang Kai was under immense pressure.

Using the Mountain and River Bell consumed an enormous amount of energy. Though his strength had increased greatly, Yang Kai still struggled to bear it. Watching an attack that could threaten his life slowly descend would shake anyone’s heart.

Yang Kai knew that if he could not stop the Great Might of Heaven and Earth, he would surely die.

Shrouded in the aura of death, Yang Kai had never felt such suffering and hardship as he did now.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The Mountain and River Bell rang out again and again, its suppressive power growing ever fiercer, yet it still could not halt the stream of light’s descent. Instead, Yang Kai was shaken so badly he grew dizzy, blood streaming from his mouth and nose, utterly miserable.

Watching the stream of light draw ever closer, with the Mountain and River Bell no longer able to block it, Yang Kai’s heart sank to rock bottom.

Just then, a flash of inspiration struck him, and he suddenly understood what this mysterious power was.

It was the Great Might of Heaven and Earth!

It was the will of the world itself!

No wonder it felt familiar.

He had wielded the Great Might of Heaven and Earth before.

Realizing this, a bold idea sprang into his mind.

In the next instant, he pointed, and the Xuan Realm Pearl appeared at his fingertip. With a thought, a strange power surged forth from the Xuan Realm Pearl, blasting straight toward the Great Might of Heaven and Earth.
