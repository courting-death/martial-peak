## Chapter 2604 — Giving You Some Face

Fan Wu stood to the side and laughed, "This Lord’s palace is not far from where the Elder resides. In the future, Elder, you must visit me often."

The Elder replied politely, "Since Saint Venerable has such intentions, this old man may indeed have matters to trouble you with in the future. I hope Saint Venerable will not find it bothersome."

Yang Kai could afford to give Fan Wu a cold face, but the Elder still had some concerns. Before Xiaoxiao became Tai Yue, the Stone Spirit Race’s strength was still a notch below the other side. Yang Kai couldn’t always stay in the Ancient Land to protect them.

Even if they didn’t become close with Fan Wu, at the very least, they shouldn’t fall out. That would be good for the Stone Spirit Race.

Fan Wu burst out laughing, "Elder, you’re being too serious. If you have free time in the future, please be sure to visit this Lord’s palace."

Luan Feng also smiled and said, "My palace welcomes Elder as well."

Cang Gou shot them a sidelong glance and snorted, "You make it sound like this Lord is so unapproachable." He turned his head and smiled at the Elder, "Elder, though my palace is a bit farther from where the Stone Spirit Race lives, I’ve long heard that the wine and delicacies brewed by the Wood Spirit Race are unmatched. If I come as a guest someday, I hope you won’t turn me away."

"I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare! If Saint Venerable wishes to come, my tribe would naturally be honored!" The Elder gave a bitter smile. Since when had he become so sought after? The three great Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land were all trying to build ties with him, all because of Yang Kai. He wasn’t a hypocrite, and continuing to exchange pleasantries with these three would be exhausting. He quickly turned to Yang Kai and said, "Sir Yang, since things are settled here, I’ll take my tribesmen and leave. Sir Yang..."

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, "I won’t go with you, Elder. This time I entered the Ancient Land to find Xiaoxiao. Now that Xiaoxiao has gone to the Blood Gate, my business is done. I’ll be leaving the Ancient Land soon."

The Elder looked regretful upon hearing this, but still said, "Then I wish Sir Yang a safe journey. If you ever return to the Ancient Land, please visit the Stone Spirit Race’s territory. I will welcome you with open arms!"

"Take care, Elder." Yang Kai cupped his fists.

The Elder returned the gesture, then bid farewell to Fan Wu and the others before turning to leave.

Soon, the Stone Spirit Race disappeared from everyone’s sight along with the Elder.

Fan Wu and the others stood behind Yang Kai, exchanging uneasy glances. In the end, Fan Wu coughed lightly and tentatively asked, "Sir Yang, what are your plans next?"

Yang Kai tilted his head at him and chuckled, "What, Lord Fan Wu, are you hoping I’ll hurry up and leave the Ancient Land?"

Fan Wu’s expression changed and he exclaimed, "I wouldn’t dare! Sir Yang’s presence is the Ancient Land’s good fortune. How could I think such a thing?"

"Really? Just say what you think. I’m just a mere First Stage Emperor, I can’t do anything to you." Yang Kai sneered sarcastically.

You can’t do anything to me, but the descendant of Heaven’s Punisher can! Fan Wu grumbled inwardly, but forced a smile and said, "Sir Yang, you overthink. From today on, you are an honored guest of the Ancient Land. If you wish to stay, we would be more than happy to have you."

Yang Kai reached out and slapped Fan Wu’s shoulder, laughing, "I didn’t expect Lord Fan Wu to be so hospitable. In that case, I suppose I’ll give you some face and stay in the Ancient Land for a while. It’s settled."

Fan Wu’s face darkened, and he wished he could slap himself a few times.

Luan Feng and Cang Gou also looked at him resentfully, thinking, why do you have to talk so much? Wouldn’t it be better to just keep quiet?

Yang Kai pointed and said, "Do you all still want this thing?"

Fan Wu and the others snapped back to their senses and saw that Yang Kai was pointing at the Mountain and River Bell lying on the ground. Their hearts skipped a beat as Fan Wu said in panic, "This is Sir Yang’s possession. Of course it should be returned to its rightful owner. How could we covet it?"

Yang Kai snorted, "Who told me before that this was a treasure of the Ancient Land?"

Cang Gou immediately forced a laugh, "A treasure belongs to the virtuous. This bell has existed in the Ancient Land for countless years, but no one has ever been able to subdue it. Since Sir Yang has made it recognize him as its master, he is naturally the virtuous one."

It was Cang Gou who had said that before. Now, fearing Yang Kai would settle accounts later, he quickly changed his tune.

Yang Kai glanced at Cang Gou with a teasing smile. "Who would’ve thought, Lord Cang Gou—always so sullen and reserved—could actually be so eloquent when he wants to be."

Cang Gou’s face turned red, and he wished he could find a hole to crawl into. He’d lost a lot of face today. Fortunately, aside from Fan Wu and Luan Feng, there was no one else here. The Yao Kings and Saint Envoys were all ten li away. If today’s events got out, how would he maintain his authority over his subordinates?

"You really don’t want it?" Yang Kai’s face turned serious. "Don’t say I didn’t give you a chance. This is a Primordial Era treasure. Its chime can suppress mountains and rivers, and the saying ‘Imperial Aura Reverses the Heavens’ refers to this Mountain and River Bell. With it, you’d have the courage to even slap a few dragons in the face. Miss this chance and you won’t get another. Don’t regret it later."

Fan Wu smiled bitterly, "Sir Yang, please stop making fun of us."

He looked like he couldn’t take it anymore, almost begging Yang Kai to quickly put the Mountain and River Bell away.

Luan Feng also pleaded, "Sir Yang, what we did before was wrong, but Shi Huo has already been executed. Please, calm your anger."

Yang Kai glanced at her and said indifferently, "Since Lady Feng says so, I’ll give you some face."

Although Luan Feng had stood by and watched before, she had at least stopped Ruoxi from taking her own life. For that alone, Yang Kai still felt some gratitude toward her.

These words surprised Luan Feng, and Fan Wu and Cang Gou quickly glanced at her, as if realizing something.

Yang Kai stepped forward, placed his hand on the Mountain and River Bell, and let his Emperor Yuan and Divine Sense surge. He felt a bit uneasy.

Back in the Shattered Star Sea, it had taken him a whole year to subdue the Mountain and River Bell. The process had been grueling. Now, being forced to remove his Soul Brand, he didn’t know if he could make it recognize him again, or how long it would take.

If it took another year, Yang Kai would be thoroughly frustrated.

His Divine Sense and Emperor Yuan easily poured into the Mountain and River Bell, making Yang Kai’s face light up with joy. This Primordial Era treasure wasn’t rejecting him. He immediately focused his mind and imprinted his Divine Soul mark inside the bell.

Shua—

A flash of light appeared on the ancient Mountain and River Bell. Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, picked it up, and tossed it in his hand.

"This..." Fan Wu’s face changed in shock.

Fan Wu had touched the Mountain and River Bell before, but even with his strength, he couldn’t lift it and could only let it fall to the ground. Now that Yang Kai could pick it up, it was clear he had subdued it.

"So fast!" Cang Gou exclaimed in astonishment.

Luan Feng’s beautiful eyes sparkled as she looked Yang Kai up and down, as if trying to see flowers bloom on him. It was infuriating. The three of them had tried many times but couldn’t channel their power into the Mountain and River Bell, yet for Yang Kai, it seemed as easy as breathing.

"Just lucky!" Yang Kai chuckled. "This treasure seems willing to recognize me as its master."

As he spoke, Yang Kai directly stored the Mountain and River Bell inside his body, then turned to look at the Incarnation sitting cross-legged on the ground.

Ever since Ruoxi sealed Shi Huo’s source inside the Incarnation, the Incarnation had fallen into a strange slumber. In Yang Kai’s perception, the Soul Incarnation within the body had also quieted down.

But though it was asleep, there was no danger. As long as the Incarnation could refine a bit of Shi Huo’s Origin, he would awaken as the new Divine Spirit Shi Huo.

"Sir Yang, what should be done with this Stone Spirit? Do you need me to have a few Yao Kings guard him here?" Luan Feng saw the concern in Yang Kai’s eyes and quickly asked.

If anyone was the biggest winner today, it was undoubtedly the Stone Spirit Race.

One of their members had been taken into the Blood Gate by the descendant of Heaven’s Punisher to inherit the power of the Divine Spirit Tai Yue, while another had obtained Shi Huo’s source.

In one stroke, two new Divine Spirits would be born among them!

The entire Stone Spirit Race didn’t have that many members to begin with.

Just for this, the Stone Spirit Race could not be underestimated in the future.

Hearing Luan Feng’s question, Yang Kai shook his head and said, "No need."

No need? Luan Feng was stunned, still a bit worried. Although the Yao Kings and Saint Envoys below knew what had happened today and surely wouldn’t disturb the Stone Spirit about to become a Divine Spirit, it was easy to deal with the king, but the little devils were troublesome. Some ignorant little yao might come here, and if they accidentally disturbed the Stone Spirit, who could bear that responsibility?

Luan Feng was about to try persuading him again when she saw Yang Kai suddenly start making mysterious hand seals, his body twisting about as if he’d gone mad, making people worry he’d break his own bones, all while muttering incantations.

He looked extremely mysterious.

The three Saint Venerables were all dumbfounded, having no idea what Yang Kai was doing.

With several pairs of eyes watching, Yang Kai suddenly slapped the Incarnation.

Shua—

The Incarnation vanished mysteriously.

The three Saint Venerables were shocked.

Fan Wu cried out, "What happened? Where did he go?"

Luan Feng and Cang Gou were also bewildered and slowly shook their heads.

The three Saint Venerables were all top experts, yet even they felt that something utterly inconceivable had just happened. How could they not be shocked?

Yang Kai clapped his hands and brushed off some imaginary dust from his robes, giving the three a sidelong glance. "What’s there to be so surprised about? I just used a little Transposition Art to send him somewhere safe, that’s all."

"Transposition Art!" Fan Wu exclaimed in shock.

But he quickly relaxed. Yang Kai had previously shown impressive space abilities, so in his mind, this so-called Transposition Art was just another use of space techniques.

Since Yang Kai could teleport himself, he should be able to teleport others too...

What he didn’t know was that Yang Kai was just putting on a show and had actually stored the Incarnation inside the Xuan Realm Pearl. Otherwise, with their cultivation, they would have noticed the traces of teleportation and wouldn’t have been so baffled.
