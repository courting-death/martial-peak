## Chapter 1102 — Master Yang Yan

The burly man cursed as he strode out, and in no time at all he vanished from sight.

“Ah—there goes that Master Yang Yan inviting insults again,” someone in the hall said with a schadenfreude laugh.

“Don’t bite off more than you can chew—if you lack the diamond drill, don’t take on porcelain work. Master Yang Yan can’t even refine a single Saint King-Grade Secret Treasure properly, yet still dares to boast of being an Origin-Grade artificer. If all the artificers in the world were like this, who would guarantee the quality of our Secret Treasures?”

“Indeed. I heard a few days ago a man brought a Secret Treasure he’d used for decades to Master Yang Yan for refinement. It used to be an excellent Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure, but after refinement its rank dropped a whole tier and it became a Saint King-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure. The owner cried as if his heart would break—truly pitiful!”

“I’ve heard someone asked Master Yang Yan to make a sword-shaped Secret Treasure, but the result turned out to be a heavy cleaver instead… Unable to meet a martial artist’s needs and still calling oneself a competent artificer—what a joke. I reckon the skill is very limited—how could the Refining Pavilion hire such a poor craftsman?”

“That’s not the Refining Pavilion’s fault. Yang Yan was merely hired. Whenever someone commissions work from that master, the Pavilion’s attendants explain everything clearly, yet people still insist on going ahead. Those fools just crave the false prestige of an Origin-Grade artificer.”

“Anyway, I’d rather wait months than have that one craft for me.”

……

Hearing all these words, Yang Kai’s expression grew stranger and stranger.

The attendant beside him let out a sigh. “Ah, Master Yang Yan truly is eccentric. The Artifact Refining Pavilion has issued many warnings, yet the master remains obstinate as ever, refusing to change. At this rate, staying here much longer will be impossible.”

“Why?” Yang Kai turned to look at him.

“That kind of behavior harms the Pavilion’s reputation; they simply can’t tolerate it any longer!”

“But that hammer Secret Treasure the big man brought out earlier looked pretty fine, and suited his build and Saint Yuan attribute—why was he still dissatisfied?”

The attendant gave a chuckle. “That fellow didn’t want a hammer at all—he wanted a great axe…”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. He immediately understood why the huge man had been so enraged. As the gossip had said, an artificer who cannot meet a martial artist’s demands is indeed no good.

“Have you decided, guest?” the attendant asked Yang Kai.

“I’ve decided.” Yang Kai nodded and handed the paper back. “I’ll have Master Yang Yan do it.”

The attendant froze for a moment, puzzled. “Are you sure?”

Yang Kai smiled. “What I’m asking for isn’t a Secret Treasure, just some very simple items. Even with poor craftsmanship, those shouldn’t pose any problem.”

“If that’s the case, I won’t say more—this way, please!” The attendant no longer tried to dissuade him and led Yang Kai toward a room, stopping at the door and motioning for Yang Kai to enter by himself. He added meaningfully, “Good luck!”

Yang Kai snorted softly and stepped in.

The room was large, covering a hundred zhang or so, and inside sat a massive furnace; behind it, a figure seemed to be present. Cross-legged on a mat, that must be the so-called Master Yang Yan.

The earlier shouts and curses had left no trace upon the master. The aura was steady and placid, like an ancient well without ripple—only the even sound of breathing came from within.

Yang Kai took a seat on a cushion before the furnace, and from behind it, Master Yang Yan’s voice sounded: “What do you wish to forge?”

Yang Kai froze and instinctively leaned to one side to look at Yang Yan from the furnace’s angle.

To his surprise, the artificer called Yang Yan was actually a woman!

Her voice was sweet and mellifluous, jolting the spirit; Yang Kai was eager to see what a woman with such a voice looked like.

He was disappointed when he looked. Only a pair of bright eyes peered out of the darkness, Yang Yan wrapped in a huge black robe—no features were visible, nor any figure.

"Everyone's always like this—are you here to refine or to stare at people?" Yang Yan muttered in displeasure.

Yang Kai felt embarrassed and immediately realized everyone who came must be as curious as he was. "Sorry, I was a little curious. I thought Master Yang Yan was a man."

"Hm." Yang Yan showed no surprise and asked again, "What do you want forged?"

Yang Kai answered, "A few simple items—nothing that's a Secret Treasure. I'll draw them for you."

As he spoke, he picked up the paper and brush already prepared beside the cushion and quickly drew several oddly shaped designs.

Martial artists always specify their demands when commissioning artifacts; every Secret Treasure has its own design in the owner's mind, so paper and pen are always prepared.

When he finished, Yang Kai handed the sketches over.

Yang Yan took them and made a soft exclamation of surprise, asking, "You want an array laid out?"

Yang Kai was stunned. "You can tell just from the shapes?"

Yang Yan snorted. "What's the difficulty? Those items you want forged have no other use beyond being arranged into an array. If I couldn't see that, I'd be blind. Do you understand arrays?"

"Not very well." Yang Kai shook his head honestly. He was confident he could set up an array, but couldn't guarantee how effective it would be; perhaps the effect would be slight.

"If you don't understand, don't fiddle with it and waste your money. The ores and materials needed to forge those items cost a lot." Yang Yan said lightly.

Yang Kai bristled. "Laying the array is my job; forging is yours. I'll pay you the fee."

He at last understood why Yang Yan's shop was empty; she liked meddling in other people's affairs, and such a person was bound not to be popular.

Unexpectedly, the woman did not take offense. After a long silence she suddenly said, "All right, I'll forge these for you, and I can even arrange a very good array. How will you pay me?"

"You can arrange arrays?"

"I can."

"You're not lying, are you?"

"Why would I lie?" Yang Yan said with disdain. "Let me set it up—if you're satisfied you can pay. I don't ask for much. Judging by your strength, you're not rich. How about one hundred Upper-Level Saint Crystals? If you can produce them now, I'll go with you immediately."

"You're short on Saint Crystals?" Yang Kai became wary at once; her eagerness seemed too generous. He had only come to ask her to make a few simple items, yet she volunteered to arrange the array—strange.

"I'm an artificer, of course I need Saint Crystals. Buying forging materials eats up stacks of Saint Crystals."

"Aren't artificers supposed to be wealthy? How could you be short on Saint Crystals?" Yang Kai was puzzled. If anyone was rich, it would be artificers or alchemists—those trades rarely worried about money.

"Look around—do I seem the sort to have many Saint Crystals?" Yang Yan rolled her eyes in the dark.

Yang Kai understood at once: since no one came to her for work, she had little income.

His guard eased a little and he asked, still uneasy, "If you leave like this, will there be any trouble?"

"No trouble. My relationship with the Refining Pavilion is merely employer and employee; I can leave anytime. In fact they'd rather I left soon, lest I ruin their reputation—a bunch of mediocrities!"

After thinking a moment Yang Kai nodded. "Fine. If you can set up an array that satisfies me, I'll pay you one hundred Upper-Level Saint Crystals."

"Then let's go." Yang Yan said, and she tucked the huge furnace into her Spatial Ring, then rose slowly.

Yang Kai sized her up. Though he couldn't see her face clearly, he saw she was small, barely shoulder-high to him, yet she had a lavish pair of bosoms, trembling and prominent, quite eye-catching.

Delicately full and compact… Yang Kai stole a few furtive glances.

Outside the room, Yang Yan told Yang Kai to wait and went alone into another chamber of the Refining Pavilion. In a short while she came out looking refreshed and signaled for Yang Kai to lead the way.

Yang Kai wasted no time and took the Star Shuttle, Yang Yan close behind.

After the two departed, the Refining Pavilion seemed to erupt in cheers; many martial artists celebrated that Master Yang Yan was finally leaving and would no longer ruin Secret Treasures or mislead apprentices. Even the attendant who had received Yang Kai couldn't help breathing easier, standing at the Pavilion's door and waving at Yang Yan as if to bid farewell—wishing her to go as far as possible.

While flying toward Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai and Yang Yan moved side by side, but oddly he felt like her eyes were deliberately sizing him up—those beautiful eyes sparkling with an eager, exploratory glint.

At first Yang Kai paid it no mind, but as she kept staring he grew uncomfortable and couldn't help asking, "What are you looking at me for?"

Yang Yan lifted her lids and sneered, "Who said I was looking at you!"

"Then why are you staring?"

"I'm looking at the Star Shuttle under your feet." Yang Yan snorted. "A Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Star Shuttle—nice quality. Want me to refine it? I can boost its performance by ten percent, provided you can gather the materials and pay a fee."

Yang Kai nearly toppled off the Star Shuttle, barely steadying himself. He looked at her suspiciously: "You can't possibly be an Origin-Grade artificer, can you?"

Tempering a Secret Treasure and forging one are entirely different; the former is far more difficult. Anyone who could temper a Saint-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure would at least be an Origin-Grade Lower-Level artificer.

The fact Yang Yan boasted such a thing meant she possessed that ability.

"Of course I am." At the mention of her rank Yang Yan straightened her chest and wore a look of pride and self-satisfaction.

Once outside, Yang Kai realized that this woman’s appearance was just as sweet as her voice. She had the kind of innocent, pure look that seemed completely harmless—one that easily inspired goodwill in others.
