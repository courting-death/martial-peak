## Chapter 1186 — Killing to Silence

“Cruel and ruthless—quite the methods you’ve got there, friend.” Yang Kai stepped out with a mocking smile, staring coldly at Meng Hongliang. He hadn’t expected the man to strike so viciously even at his own sect-mates; clearly, he was no decent person.

He stepped up to the mid‑aged man and gave a slight nod.

The middle‑aged man was stupefied—he had been certain death was imminent, yet someone had actually come out to save him.

And the person who saved him was Yang Kai, a complete stranger to him; the sensation was surreal.

"Move aside and tend your wounds first." Seeing his pitiful state and how little Saint Yuan he had left, Yang Kai tossed him a Healing Pill and said coolly.

"But you..." The middle‑aged man accepted the pill with hesitation. Yang Kai's cultivation was far too low; he feared this rash youth who'd rushed out to save him might suffer misfortune—after all, Meng Hongliang was not to be trifled with.

Yet when he recalled the power of that black flame and saw Yang Kai's composed expression, the man suddenly nodded. "All right!"

Saying that, he truly shuffled aside, swallowed the pill, and sat down to cultivate in peace.

He had no idea what backing Yang Kai could possibly have to stand up to so many from Quehe Sect, but since the youth dared to intervene, it was clear he did not regard people like Meng Hongliang.

He instinctively assumed Yang Kai must hail from some top power, perhaps the scion of an important family within such a power; if that were true, a mere mention of the name would keep Meng Hongliang from acting rashly.

Quehe Sect was decent, but on Dark Star it wasn't first‑rate—at best upper‑mid tier. Meng Hongliang was the kind who bullied the weak and feared the strong; naturally he wouldn't provoke powerful enemies.

As expected, Meng Hongliang’s expression shifted unpredictably as he scrutinized Yang Kai, comparing him against all the renowned young elites of Dark Star he’d heard of—yet none matched the man before him. Under the strange gazes of several of his sect-mates, Meng Hongliang snapped harshly, “You killed my fellow disciple—what is your intention?”

Yang Kai let out a sneer and slowly shook his head. “You’ve got it wrong. The one who killed him wasn’t me—it was you. Mm… though to be fair, even if you hadn’t acted, he was doomed anyway. But the cause of death lies in your hand, not mine.”

Meng Hongliang’s face turned red, then pale, as he ground his teeth and said, “If you hadn’t struck from the shadows, why would I have done that?”

After saying this, his expression suddenly calmed. He nodded and said, “Yes, I killed Junior Brother Qi — but only because I couldn’t bear to watch him suffer in the flames any longer. I merely gave him release a little sooner.”

He even found a reason for it. Hearing that, the Quehe Sect men and women privately breathed easier. Though killing a fellow disciple was still objectionable in their eyes, that explanation softened matters; they'd all seen Junior Brother Qi's fate and knew that even if Meng Hongliang hadn't acted, Qi would have certainly perished. So they crowded around Meng Hongliang.

Meng Hongliang sneered and, in the blink of an eye, disentangled himself from the whirlpool of blame. He had a knack for specious argument. Fixing Yang Kai with a cold stare, he said slowly, "Which sect do you hail from? If it's convenient, tell us. Quehe Sect may not be a great power, but our elders have broad connections. If you belong to a friendly sect, don't meddle in this matter."

"Senior Brother Meng, I know this man," the woman dressed as a young married lady frowned. After she had moved closer to Meng Hongliang, her gaze had remained fixed on Yang Kai; she looked wary.

At her words Meng Hongliang immediately leaned in and asked in a low voice.

The woman did not conceal anything. She briefly recounted the clash between Yin Jianzhong of Qingque Sect and Yang Kai back when Flowing Flame Sandland had not yet been opened. She had been nearby and had seen the whole thing, so she recognized Yang Kai at once.

"Yingyue Hall?" Meng Hongliang was surprised; his brows knit and his face darkened.

Yingyue Hall wasn't topmost among the powers, but it far outclassed Quehe Sect. Yingyue Hall harbored many experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; they were not comparable to Quehe Sect.

The two powers were ten thousand eight hundred li apart and usually kept to themselves, but upon hearing that Wei Guchang, Yingyue Hall's prodigy, had intervened for Yang Kai, Meng Hongliang grew hesitant.

If Wei Guchang came to Quehe Sect to make trouble for him, it would be troublesome indeed.

But matters had already reached this point—his own sectmate had been mercilessly slain by his hand; it would be improper to slink away now. Moreover, he couldn't risk the Fire-Glow Crystal Core's existence leaking out, which was precisely why, even after obtaining it, he had determined to wipe out the middle‑aged man.

Dead men can't spill secrets!

"But he himself said he isn't from Yingyue Hall," the woman said in puzzlement.

"He's not from Yingyue Hall?" Meng Hongliang's eyes brightened.

"Indeed, I'm not from Yingyue Hall." Yang Kai stood there brazenly, as if courting death. He had kept silent while Meng Hongliang and the woman spoke; only now did he speak. "I only have a slight acquaintance with Wei Guchang. You needn't fear him coming to make trouble."

Meng Hongliang's face darkened at being seen through. His eyes flickered and he hesitated.

The middle‑aged man who was cultivating to recover almost coughed up a mouthful of blood when he heard Yang Kai speak!

The situation had just eased and the man inwardly rejoiced, convinced his guess had been right: this youth who saved him must have some backing. As long as the youth kept quiet, Meng Hongliang's character would make him hold back and desist.

If so, the two of them could slip away unharmed, and revenge could be plotted slowly later.

But the youth proved a simpleton; he blew his only leverage in one breath. Now Meng Hongliang would hardly go easy on him. Without a powerful patron—and with only First Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivation—he would certainly be doomed.

For a moment the middle‑aged man was angry and anxious; he'd never seen such a fool.

Still, the man had been saved by Yang Kai and therefore dragged down with him. He sighed inwardly and resolved to recover some strength quickly; once Meng Hongliang acted, he would do his utmost to stall them and give Yang Kai a chance to flee.

On the other side, Meng Hongliang's face flickered through many hues before settling into one of resolve. He fixed Yang Kai with a murderous glare. "Yingyue Hall or Wei Guchang—what of it? Today I will kill you. You won't live to see tomorrow!"

As he finished, he suddenly waved his hand and barked, "Beware his black flame! Don't give him a chance to send a message!"

He was tearing off the mask—planning to kill and silence. Not one to be reckless, he ordered his juniors to attack while a hidden golden radiance bloomed in his palm.

He dreaded that Demonic Flame. His plan was to have his sectmates distract Yang Kai while he slipped in to finish him off—and at no cost must he allow Yang Kai time to draw the compass Secret Treasure and send word, lest all be ruined.

Meng Hongliang's order given, four Saint‑King Second‑Stage cultivators lunged at Yang Kai with murderous intent. All four surged their Saint Yuan and activated defensive Secret Treasures to guard themselves.

Those who dared venture into Flowing Flame Sandland mostly wore defensive armor. Such armors could fend off fire poison and offered sturdy protection; at least when fighting equals they often relied on armor to blunt some of the harm.

The black flame was terrifying. Though they leapt forward, none dared approach Yang Kai's body. The woman casually drew a long‑whip Secret Treasure; it hummed like thunder and turned into a streak of azure light that struck toward Yang Kai, her lovely face hard and cruel.

The other three likewise used long‑range Secret Treasures and martial arts, unleashing a barrage at Yang Kai's position.

As they struck, a burst of golden light silently shot from Meng Hongliang's hand. Whatever trick he had used, the instant the light flew out its brilliance was somehow shrouded.

Four Second‑Stage Saint Kings and one Third‑Stage Saint King attacking a lone First‑Stage Saint King—there was no need to imagine the outcome.

So Meng Hongliang's mouth curled into a smile the moment he struck.

But in an instant that smile froze on his face.

He saw the besieged youth manifest a black flame longsword that cleaved a jet of inky light as if intent on swallowing all radiance. It not only scattered the assaults of two of his juniors but cleaved through them like a gale, slicing straight through their bodies.

Their defensive armors proved as fragile as paper; the Saint Yuan bristling about them provided not the slightest defense.

The two juniors' bodies were severed in an instant.

That was not the end. The youth produced a black spear and seemingly tossed it casually. The spear pierced the aura of the woman's long whip, bounced it back, and drove through her abdomen, leaving a hole.

From start to finish the woman had not even time to react.

Immediately a purple shield appeared at his side with a clanging ring, sparks flying across its surface. Golden lights flickered and then sped back toward Meng Hongliang's position.

Yang Kai frowned—he recognized Meng Hongliang's Secret Treasure was indeed exceptional. A golden assault earlier had nearly shattered his Vast Heaven Shield, so now Yang Kai was not careless; sensing the incoming attack, he brought out the Purple Shield to defend.

A quick glance revealed the returning radiance to be a volley of hair‑thin flying‑needle Secret Treasures.

Such Secret Treasures were rare. Flying‑needles lacked great power and required artificers to produce them in large numbers to become lethal—making them costly and difficult to craft.
