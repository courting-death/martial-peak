## Chapter 1399 — As If in a Dream

Yang Yan had been waiting for him to say that; upon hearing it she, without hesitation, took a Formation Plate from her Spatial Ring. The Formation Plate she produced was much like the one Wu Yi had used—both gold and silver in color—only slightly smaller in size.

Small it might be, but it posed no problem for controlling the great array over Dragon Lair Mountain.

A few streams of Saint Yuan poured into it, and at once a low humming sound rose from within the Formation Plate. In the next moment, the gold and silver lights drew toward the center, swiftly merging into one—indistinguishable from each other.

At the same time, Dragon Lair Mountain, which had been clearly visible, was once again shrouded by clouds and mist; the Protective Mountain Array flickered with faint light and wrapped the entire peak.

"I'll head back first—Wu Yi is still a bit inexperienced with controlling the formation," Yang Yan said.

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Yang Yan immediately flashed downward; the moment she left, Yang Kai's figure was instantly exposed, a sight that left all the experts watching this place greatly surprised.

Yang Kai's gaze swept coldly around. Although he could see no one, he knew Dragon Lair Mountain had already drawn far too many experts' attention. Most were there only to gawk; only a few were actually in some way connected to this siege on Dragon Lair Mountain.

Letting out a cold chuckle, Yang Kai's figure flickered and he plunged into Dragon Lair Mountain.

“This brat… he’s reactivated the Protective Mountain Array. Could it be he intends to wipe them all out in one sweep?” In Tianyun City, Fei Zhi Tu looked completely bewildered.

Qian Tong was also puzzled: "He wouldn't have such an appetite, would he?"

The two exchanged a glance, at a loss for how to explain the scene before them.

Elsewhere, Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng likewise felt puzzled, though they had some confidence in their subordinates and were not overly worried. Feng Yan, who had been supporting Old Woman Feng, showed a flicker of oddity at her brow, then with keen interest began to watch toward Dragon Lair Mountain.

She very much wanted to see what the final outcome of this battle would be.

"How presumptuous!" At Liuli Sect, a beautiful woman in palace dress slowly shook her head, disappointment showing in her eyes. She had once regarded Dragon Lair Mountain's heavy seals with some respect, but after taking a small advantage, Dragon Lair Mountain acted so arrogant—daring to activate the Protective Mountain Array again, attempting to trap everyone at once—truly disappointing.

Activating the great array without absolute superiority is not trapping a turtle in a jar; it's cutting off one's own path of escape.

Behind the woman stood two other women: one with a pleased, schadenfreude expression, the other anxious and pale-faced.

The two were similar in age and figure but starkly different in appearance—one alluring and seductive, the other utterly unsightly. They were Yin Sudie and Daiyuan of Liuli Sect, while the woman who had spoken earlier was Gong Aofu, the sect leader's daughter and the master of Yin Sudie and Daiyuan.

"Master, what do you think of Dragon Lair Mountain's fate this time?" Yin Sudie asked, ostensibly consulting her Master, though her eyes glanced toward Daiyuan.

She had once suffered a heavy loss at Yang Kai's hands and naturally hated him deeply. Now, seeing Dragon Lair Mountain in precarious straits, she was pleased—especially at Daiyuan's worried expression.

"Why ask me such an obvious thing?" Gong Aofu snorted coldly.

"You mean Dragon Lair Mountain won't get through this trial?" Yin Sudie giggled.

"From the start, those in charge of Dragon Lair Mountain made the wrong decision," Gong Aofu said slowly, not answering directly. "To pit such a small hill against behemoths like Myriad Beasts Mountain and the Demon Blood Sect is like striking an egg against a rock. Even if, by some chance, they win, so what? Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng are still here—will they stand by and watch Dragon Lair Mountain flaunt its might? If they intervene, won't it end in submission?"

"I see!" Yin Sudie put on an expression of being instructed, glancing triumphantly at Daiyuan, who bit her lip and said nothing.

With a light laugh, Yin Sudie continued, "So Master means Dragon Lair Mountain shouldn't have provoked Myriad Beasts Mountain and the Demon Blood Sect."

Gong Aofu neither admitted nor denied, but said leisurely, "Such is the way of the world: whoever's fist is larger gets to speak."

"But Master, if Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng really act, Yingyue Hall won't sit idly by, and Elder Qian Tong certainly won't fold his arms!" Daiyuan suddenly interjected, her face growing serious.

"Yingyue Hall?" Gong Aofu glanced at Daiyuan, smiling slightly. "Even so, so what? With Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng's methods, dealing with a Dragon Lair Mountain would take only a few breaths. If Qian Tong acted, who could he possibly stop? By then people would already be dead—do you think Yingyue Hall would pick a quarrel with Myriad Beasts Mountain and the Demon Blood Sect over a pile of corpses?"

Daiyuan trembled.

Gong Aofu frowned and looked at her, suspicious: "Yuan'er, are you unwell?"

Before Daiyuan could answer, Yin Sudie chuckled from the side: "Master, Senior Sister is only worried about Dragon Lair Mountain; she isn't unwell."

"Why would you worry about Dragon Lair Mountain?" Gong Aofu asked Daiyuan puzzled. "Do you know the people there?"

"Master, have you forgotten? A while back two people came to the sect to pay respects to Senior Sister, didn't they?"

"I remember—there was a man and a woman, right? Could that man and woman be..." Gong Aofu suddenly realized, as if she had connected the dots.

"Correct. The man is called Yang Kai and the woman Yang Yan; they are the ones in charge of Dragon Lair Mountain and seem to be on good terms with Senior Sister," Yin Sudie said with a playful smile.

Gong Aofu's brows knitted as she looked at Daiyuan, asking in a low voice, "Yuan'er, is that true?"

"Yes!" Daiyuan nodded heavily.

"Oh, no wonder you looked so worried. But whether you worry or not, remember not to bring trouble upon yourself. If Dragon Lair Mountain loses that's one thing; if they win, it won't end easily. It could involve several great powers, and Liuli Sect won't wade into that mess."

"But Master, Junior Brother Yang saved my life!" Daiyuan hurriedly said.

"So what?" Gong Aofu glared at her. "Judging by his manner you can tell he's reckless and headstrong, only prone to acts of bravado. Such a man need not be befriended—he will suffer losses sooner or later. Sudie!"

"Disciple is here!" Yin Sudie replied quickly.

"Your Senior Sister is in a bad mood; accompany her and don't let her do anything foolish."

"Yes!" Yin Sudie lifted her eyes toward Daiyuan and smiled, appearing harmless while inwardly delighted—the Master's intention was clear: have her watch over Senior Sister and prevent her from going to Dragon Lair Mountain to meddle.

Seeing Daiyuan's worried, anxious but powerless expression, Yin Sudie felt happier than if she'd picked up millions of Saint Crystals. Although her cultivation had already reached the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, higher than Daiyuan, because of the cultivation method Daiyuan practiced she was indispensable in the sect. Thus Yin Sudie felt uneasy and secretly dreamed of one day pushing Daiyuan out of Liuli Sect to monopolize the Master's favor.

……

Inside Dragon Lair Mountain, Ning Xiangchen stared blankly at an enemy of equal cultivation, looking as if in a dream.

The enemy before him was now completely lifeless, without excessive wounds—only a finger-sized hole in the chest from which dark red blood flowed.

Needless to say, this enemy had been killed by him.

Yet the ease of it made Ning Xiangchen almost unwilling to believe it; if not for his cultivation level he might have thought he had broken through to the peak of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

When he'd first met that enemy, Ning Xiangchen had only produced a short-sword Secret Treasure and sparred for the time of half a cup of tea, intending to feint and release a long-prepared killing move. Who would have known the opponent could not withstand his short-sword Secret Treasure and was pierced through the heart, dying on the spot.

Is this still the Origin Returning Realm? It felt almost like crushing a Saint King Realm.

Moreover, this was already the second Origin Returning Realm he had slain.

In the past, when meeting opponents of the same realm, which battle was not fought until heaven and earth darkened? Which fight lasted less than an hour? The longest Ning Xiangchen remembered had lasted seven or eight hours; in the end both were exhausted and their Saint Yuan depleted, agreeing to fight another day.

But now, within the time of a cup of tea, he had killed two opponents of the same level.

The enemy's eyes bulged wide, as if in death he had seen something unbelievable.

Ning Xiangchen, though puzzled by the opponent's abnormal performance, was certain there must be some hidden mystery here allowing him to kill so easily.

That hidden mystery should be related to the formations. Having encountered two Origin Returning Realm enemies in succession, Ning Xiangchen noticed they were restrained in battle—Their Saint Yuan circulated poorly, as if suppressed by an invisible force; they often cried out as if having seen a terrifying scene, and occasionally their attacks were directed into empty space.

Having lived so many years, Ning Xiangchen had never seen such an absurd sight. His regard for Dragon Lair Mountain rose another level; a formation that could cause Origin Returning Realm cultivators to falter repeatedly, even suppress their cultivation while posing no barrier to his own people, was not something any ordinary formation master could lay out.

Recalling Chang Qi and Hao An's inscrutable smiles, Ning Xiangchen suddenly understood, in part, why they had remained so calm before the powerful enemies arrived.

Perhaps this time he truly had made an exceedingly wise decision!

With that thought, Ning Xiangchen beckoned and recalled his short-sword from nearby, then continued forward with a calm expression, no longer showing the previous unease and anxiety.

He did not need to fathom how wondrous the formations were; he only knew that enemies would "just so happen" to appear before him and allow him to slaughter them at will.
