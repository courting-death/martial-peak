## Chapter 2154 — Gong Wenshan

“Then save the sarcasm!” Wuchang wasn’t the least bit afraid of Xiao Chen, even though the latter hailed from the Southern Territory’s overlord sect, Star God Palace.

To Wuchang, there were only two kinds of people in this world.

Those stronger than him, and those weaker than him!

The strong might win his respect, even rouse his fighting spirit; the weak… he never spared them a courteous word, and it had nothing to do with background.

Stung by Wuchang’s retort, Xiao Chen found it hard to keep his composure. His face darkened as he said coldly, “Count yourself fortunate that I carry an important duty this time—otherwise, I would’ve already taken your dog life.”

The important mission he spoke of was, of course, the task of personally protecting Princess Lan Xun.

Wuchang sneered and couldn't be bothered to pay him any more attention.

As the two exchanged words, many cultivators had already rushed to the front of the great hall, each finding their own spot, raising their heads to gaze up at this grand and imposing structure, feeling a deep sense of insignificance well up from the depths of their hearts.

"What do you all think?"

Suddenly, someone stepped out from the crowd, showing no fear as he came before Wuchang and the others. He swept his gaze over everyone and asked, "How should we break this golden barrier?"

This man was quite dignified in appearance, handsome and refined, looking to be around thirty, dressed in a fitted black outfit that made him seem especially capable. The energy fluctuations radiating from him made it clear he was also a cultivator at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

"Kong Qi? You're here too!" Xiao Chen looked at the man, his eyes narrowing as if he recognized him.

The young man called Kong Qi smiled slightly and said, "Why couldn't I be here? Qiyao Commerce Guild has a few spots for Four Seasons Land, don't we? Brother Xiao, your question is rather odd."

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood that this Kong Qi must be a rising star of the Qiyao Commerce Guild.

Although in the Southern Territory, Qiyao Commerce Guild and Ziyuan Commerce Guild were both mainly business-oriented, that didn't mean these two great forces lacked experts. On the contrary, the foundations of these two Commerce Guilds were no weaker than any top Sect.

It's just that people's understanding and prejudice made them think these guilds were weaker, that's all.

"In my opinion," Kong said, "this should be a type of formation barrier. Shouldn't we find someone skilled in this field to take a look?"

"Before absolute strength, any barrier or formation is just an illusion. Just smash it directly!" A cold snort rang out as Luo Yuan was the first to move. He reached out and grasped at the void, and a flamboyantly shaped battle axe suddenly appeared in his palm. Origin Qi poured in madly, Law Power coiled around the axe blade, and the surging tide of Spiritual Qi and pressure made everyone present change color.

Even someone as strong as Wuchang showed a slightly grave expression, as if he sensed a threat from Luo Yuan's strike.

"Eight Directions Sect really produced a monster!" Lan Xun's body was shrouded in a faint blue glow, offsetting the incoming pressure and Spiritual Qi shockwave, and she sighed softly.

Before this, she would never have believed that a small Sect considered only mid-tier in the Southern Territory could nurture such talent. Even Star God Palace couldn't produce many like him.

No wonder he dared to challenge Wuchang head-on. With such astonishing strength, he truly had the backing to be so arrogant.

Crack—

Under everyone's gaze, Luo Yuan's arm holding the battle axe suddenly swelled, knotted muscles bulging high, exuding a violent beauty.

He slowly spun the battle axe, seemingly gathering power, and with each rotation, the energy fluctuations from the axe doubled.

After three or five times, even the void trembled from the terrifying energy, and those like Wuchang at the front could barely keep their footing…

As for those with slightly lower strength, they fell straight to the ground, faces pale, eyes trembling as they stared ahead.

Everyone was thinking: if such a blow landed on them, what would the result be?

Yang Kai's eyes flickered, equally shocked by Luo Yuan's actions, but he also knew that such an attack couldn't be used in real combat—the charging time was too long, and no enemy would give Luo Yuan so much time. Likewise, unleashing such a blow would put a heavy burden on Luo Yuan himself.

He understood this, and so did Wuchang, Xiao Chen, Xiao Baiyi, and Lan Xun among those present.

"Haaah—" Suddenly, Luo Yuan roared, and the battle axe flew from his hand, turning into a streak of light, wrapped in seemingly world-destroying power, and shot toward the golden barrier ahead.

In that moment, everyone held their breath and watched in silence.

Boom—

Light burst everywhere, energy roared and surged, the golden barrier dented inward slightly, but… it remained as solid as ever.

In the next instant, the golden light returned to normal, and the battle axe rebounded even faster, slicing past Luo Yuan and cutting off a few strands of his black hair…

Luo Yuan reached up and touched his cheek, where a finger-length wound had opened, flesh curling and warm blood oozing out.

"Mm, looks like brute force won't break it," Kong Qi said blandly. "After all, this barrier was set by an Emperor Realm expert!"

He didn't mock Luo Yuan. Although Luo Yuan's actions were a bit reckless, he had proven with his own actions that this barrier couldn't be broken by brute force alone.

"Princess…" Xiao Chen suddenly turned to Lan Xun, calling out for her opinion.

Lan Xun shook her head and said, "I haven't figured anything out yet, I'm not confident…"

Xiao Chen nodded slightly. "Then please study it a bit more, Princess."

Lan Xun said nothing, her beautiful eyes still fixed ahead. Judging by her posture, she seemed quite knowledgeable about formations and was searching for the barrier's weakness.

At this moment, Kong Qi turned around, looked ahead, and said, "Everyone, is there anyone skilled in formations? Come take a look! This should be the legendary Time Temple. If we can break this barrier, we can enter and see for ourselves. If anyone has the ability, please don't keep it to yourself!"

Over thirty people looked at each other, but no one responded.

The Dao of Formations, like the Dao of Alchemy and the Dao of Artifacts, was broad and profound. It was easy to get started, but reaching higher realms was not so simple.

Everyone here was a Dao Origin Realm cultivator and knew a bit about formations, but who had the confidence to break a barrier left by an Emperor Realm expert?

In the silence, Kong Qi smiled slightly, turned to look at someone in the crowd, and said, "Brother Gong, won't you give it a try?"

At these words, everyone turned their gaze to that person, only to see him standing there with a gloomy face, looking at Kong Qi with a resentful expression.

"Gong… that's not a common surname. Could it be…"

"He's from the Gong family of Tianhe Valley… so that's it!"

"Ha, now there's hope for breaking the barrier."

The many cultivators all started talking at once, focusing their attention on the man surnamed Gong.

"Who is he?" Yang Kai asked in a low voice. "Why does everyone seem so confident in him?"

Bian Yuqing glanced at him sideways. "Why are you asking me?"

She looked like she had finally found a chance to extort Yang Kai for once.

"Say it or don't!" Yang Kai snorted.

Bian Yuqing narrowed her eyes. "This Protector just realized, you brat… you're really infuriating!"

"Hmph, that depends on who I'm dealing with."

Kou Wu added, "The Gong family is quite famous in the Southern Territory. Although their overall strength isn't that great, every cultivator in their family is skilled in formations and can't be underestimated. Especially their old ancestor, who achieved Emperor Realm cultivation decades ago by mastering formations, and is ranked among the top three in the entire Southern Territory in the Dao of Formations… As for this man here, if I remember right, he should be the Young Master of the current generation, Gong Wenshan."

"Got it." Yang Kai nodded.

Kou Wu was right. The man in the crowd was indeed the Young Master of the Gong family, Gong Wenshan. Although his cultivation wasn't the highest, it was still decent—at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. But when it came to formations, everyone here together probably couldn't match even a fraction of his knowledge.

The Gong family had been masters of formations for generations.

At this moment, Gong Wenshan's face was wrinkled like a bitter melon as he walked forward under everyone's gaze, muttering to himself, "Damn it… I just wanted to stroll around, how did I end up in this mess again… If I refuse now, I'll definitely anger the crowd. These guys are eyeing me like tigers, they'll beat the crap out of me… Ugh, so annoying. Kong Qi, you bastard, one day I'll make you eat shit and die!"

Kong Qi, standing off to the side, twitched his mouth and said, "Brother Gong… do you really think, with my hearing, I can't hear what you're muttering?"

Gong Wenshan looked up at Kong Qi with his bitter melon face and snorted, "I'm saying it for you to hear, so what!"

Kong Qi could only smile wryly and cup his fists. "Brother Gong, please forgive me. It's just that no one here is skilled in formations, so we can only rely on you."

Gong Wenshan snorted, "We've known each other for decades, you know my temper!"

Kong Qi nodded repeatedly. "Yes, yes, you hate trouble the most… I know that well."

"Breaking a formation barrier is the most troublesome thing!" Gong Wenshan's face was so cold it could scrape off a layer of frost. He walked up to the golden light, looked it over, then turned and said, "I can break it, but what do I get in return?"

"A reward…" Kong Qi's face twitched. Was this the legendary taking advantage of a crisis? For a moment, he didn't know how to respond.

"How about letting you live? Does that count as a reward?" Wuchang suddenly interjected.

Gong Wenshan immediately turned to look at him, a mocking smile on his lips. "Oh? Are you threatening me?"

Wuchang snorted, "Break the barrier and you live. Otherwise, I'll kill you right here!"

He looked completely serious, clearly not joking.

No one thought he was joking either, since these words came from Wuchang's mouth.

"Interesting…" Even facing Wuchang, Gong Wenshan showed not a trace of fear. Their gazes met, neither backing down—clearly, he was a tough character too.
