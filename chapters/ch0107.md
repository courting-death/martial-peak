## Chapter 107 — The Ambush

As he moved, Yang Kai naturally followed suit. At this moment, Junior Brother Ye’s entire focus was drawn to the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, making it the perfect opportunity for a stealth attack.

He could never have dreamed that Yang Kai had pinpointed his location and was bold enough to launch a surprise assault.

A greedy expression flickered across Junior Brother Ye’s face. His body moved with the agility of a cat, silent and graceful, inching closer and closer to the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.

The distance narrowed—twenty zhang, ten zhang, nine zhang...

The Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew remained stationary, continuously absorbing the valley’s yin energy, stirring the surrounding air into gusts of chilling wind.

When Junior Brother Ye was only five zhang away, his restrained Yuan Qi suddenly surged violently. Like a hunting leopard pouncing on its prey, he sprang forward, eyes blazing with fervor, reaching out to seize the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.

Yang Kai moved as well, his gaze locked on Junior Brother Ye. With feet swift as the wind and wielding the longsword he had just seized, he prepared to strike from the side while his opponent remained unaware.

Just as Junior Brother Ye thought he was about to succeed, the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew abruptly ceased absorbing yin energy. From within, it erupted with an intense wave of chilling yin energy, violently surging toward Junior Brother Ye.

The sudden change was too swift; Junior Brother Ye could not halt his advance.

His expression twisted in terror. After careful observation, he had confirmed this was a rare treasure of heavenly grade, but he had never imagined it possessed such sentience, capable of counterattacking in times of danger.

His mind reeling, Junior Brother Ye felt the oncoming cold strike and panicked. He activated his Yuan Qi, attempting to resist the impending threat.

Just as he braced for impact, the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew wavered and vanished in the blink of an eye.

The moment it disappeared, the bright surroundings plunged into darkness.

The sudden shift in light severely impaired Junior Brother Ye’s vision, leaving him unable to discern any changes around him. It was at this instant that Yang Kai struck.

Though Yang Kai’s sight was also affected, he could roughly determine the enemy’s position. His sword thrust forward—whether it ended Junior Brother Ye’s life or not, it would certainly make him suffer.

Junior Brother Ye’s entire focus was on the chilling energy before him; he was oblivious to the deadly strike coming from the side.

In the next moment, his body staggered. The cold energy struck him head-on, as if he had fallen into an ice cellar. His Yuan Qi faltered, and he shuddered uncontrollably. Before he could catch his breath, a sharp pain erupted in his waist and abdomen, as if pierced by a sharp blade.

Though caught off guard, Junior Brother Ye’s battle experience was considerable. As a master of the Separation and Union Realm, despite impaired vision, he instinctively lifted his leg and swept toward Yang Kai.

A muffled grunt escaped as Yang Kai was struck on the shoulder blade, flying backward on impact.

Heavy breaths echoed from both sides. At this moment, Yang Kai no longer needed to conceal himself.

As his vision gradually cleared, Junior Brother Ye’s eyes glared with hatred toward Yang Kai. His body trembled uncontrollably, clutching his wounded side, staggering unsteadily.

A longsword protruded from his waist. Yang Kai’s earlier strike had been nearly all-out, and with Junior Brother Ye expending energy to resist the cold, he was defenseless.

“It’s you!” Upon recognizing Yang Kai’s face, Junior Brother Ye’s expression lit up. He had considered several possibilities: that Yuan Lang or Junior Brother Wu had ambushed him, as greed and rivalry among disciples were not uncommon; or that the woman sought to kill him; or, less likely, that another faction was present in the valley.

But he never imagined that the attacker was none other than Yang Kai—the very one they had all deemed a lamb to the slaughter.

“Heh heh!” Yang Kai slowly rose, a feral smile crossing his face. He flexed the shoulder that had been struck, finding no serious injury, and advanced step by step without fear. Now, Junior Brother Ye was truly a spent arrow.

“How is this possible...” Junior Brother Ye’s face paled.

“Though I don’t know what surprises you, it seems all your expectations have been turned upside down,” Yang Kai said coldly.

“We...” Junior Brother Ye looked down in astonishment. “This is Junior Brother Wu’s sword.”

“That’s right. He’s dead now. And you’re next.”

“So, we’ve all been deceived by you!” At that moment, a surge of bitter resentment and humiliation welled up in Junior Brother Ye’s heart.

When Senior Brother Cai had been slain by Yang Kai, it could be explained by the power of the secret treasure. But now, he himself was about to die at Yang Kai’s hands.

I am a master of the Separation and Union Realm! And yet I am to be killed by a cultivator of the Open Origin Realm? What a world! How utterly humiliating!

With a sudden spurt, Junior Brother Ye spat a mouthful of blood, his expression growing increasingly feeble. The wounds on his body and the humiliation in his heart left him exhausted and powerless, unable to resist.

“I bear you no grudge, but since you came looking for trouble, don’t blame me for being ruthless,” Yang Kai said coldly. He stepped forward and raised his palm, unleashing a powerful strike.

In a last flicker of defiance, Junior Brother Ye’s eyes brightened sharply. He drew the longsword from his side, gripping it tightly as he slashed toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai lowered his body and delivered a hook punch to Junior Brother Ye’s chin. The entire jaw shattered instantly, and Junior Brother Ye’s body soared into the air before crashing heavily to the ground.

Before he could recover, Yang Kai surged forward with two punches, his Yuan Qi erupting. Junior Brother Ye’s vitality was extinguished instantly.

Rising to his feet, Yang Kai sneered, “Playing tricks and schemes? I am your grandfather!”

It was clear Junior Brother Ye had feigned weakness, hoping to lure Yang Kai close before delivering a fatal blow.

But Yang Kai had long been prepared. A cornered rabbit still bites, especially a warrior. Until the enemy was dead, any carelessness could cost one’s life.

After killing him, Yang Kai searched the body but found little of value—just a few bottles of spare pills and some silver notes.

After all, those who traveled rarely carried much.

The pills were for his own use, but the silver notes numbered several, which Yang Kai stuffed into his pocket without much thought.

He discarded the corpse against a nearby large tree and scanned the surroundings, only to find the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew had long since vanished.

Yang Kai had clearly felt the chilling yin energy it had unleashed—a domineering, icy coldness. No wonder it needed his assistance to absorb it. This treasure was truly sentient; sensing danger, it would flee. Aside from Yang Yuan Qi, there seemed no other way to capture it.

There was still more than an hour before dawn. He had to quicken his pace. But before that, Yang Kai needed to return and ask Xia Ningshang how to tame the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew.
