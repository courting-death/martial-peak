## Chapter 1353 — Fierce Battle

When plunged into crisis, the worst thing is to see not the slightest hope of survival; now, after hearing Yang Kai's words, both Cai He and Du Sisi rejoiced wildly, for if Yang Kai was right, then with the three of them working together they might yet be able to destroy that puppet.

The two of them immediately swept the gloom from their faces, exchanged a look, and were filled with renewed vigor.

No time to waste — the three moved at once. Because of Yang Kai's prior probing, everyone already understood the puppet's alert radius. Standing more than ten zhang away from it, Cai He and Du Sisi each took a corner and repeatedly produced devices for forming arrays from their Spatial Rings, pouring Saint Yuan into them and scattering them around.

The moment those devices touched the ground they flashed and vanished without a trace; even Yang Kai's Divine Sense could detect nothing.

The two of them set up the formations with practiced ease, while Yang Kai's gaze lingered incessantly on several key spots of the enormous puppet — its head, chest, and lower abdomen — the places he felt the spirit that drove the puppet must be hidden, though when he had faced it alone earlier he couldn't examine them carefully or be certain which spot it was.

If he could pinpoint it, then smashing that one spot should stop the puppet's actions.

Yang Kai silently considered this, turning the idea over in his mind and finding nothing wrong with it.

After a short while, Cai He and Du Sisi were both ready; they exchanged looks, pressed their palms together, and suddenly chanted in low unison, "He!"

In the next moment, the Saint Yuan within their bodies seemed to resonate with certain items around them; driven by that surge of Saint Yuan, the Spiritual Qi within a radius of a dozen or so zhang around the puppet trembled slightly, then quickly returned to normal.

Yang Kai scanned the scene and saw nothing unusual, but he wasn't surprised — many formations show nothing from the outside even when activated; only by entering can one glimpse their true workings.

"Brother Yang, Miss Sisi and I are ready; you can move whenever you like!" Cai He called out.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, his expression grave. "Then I'll trouble you two."

"Don't mention it, Brother Yang. This battle will rely on your strength. Be careful — Miss Sisi and I can only maintain the formations; we'll use their power to support your action!"

“Don’t you dare take this chance to run off,” Du Sisi said, her expression shifting several times, still unable to fully trust Yang Kai’s character. If Yang Kai were to seize the moment and flee while she and Cai He were busy using the formation to restrain the puppet’s speed, then she and Cai He would have gone through all that effort just to make wedding clothes for someone else.

Yang Kai didn't take offense at her suspicion; they weren't close, so such concerns were natural. Besides, the three of them had to cooperate, and any disagreement could lead to dire consequences. He said calmly, "Don't worry. Since I'm working with you, I won't abandon you."

Only after receiving Yang Kai’s assurance did Du Sisi’s face break into a bright smile. She quickly added, insincerely, “I was just saying that casually.”

Yang Kai said no more. He inhaled deeply, glanced at the enormous puppet that stood motionless, his expression suddenly solemn. With a flick of his body he charged toward it.

In the blink of an eye he had plunged into the grand array Cai He and Du Sisi had arranged. His vision shifted: he found himself as if standing on the surface of a lake, the water beneath him clear as a mirror with ripples glittering, yet from that surface there was an invisible tug that seemed intent on restraining his movement.

Not only that, but a compressing force pressed in from all sides, likewise restricting his freedom.

The lake-surface illusion beneath his feet, he realized, must be the effect of Cai He's Mirror Lake Mud Dragon Formation, while the surrounding invisible squeezing force was likely Du Sisi's Ground-Imprisonment Formation.

Indeed, there was more to them than met the eye.

Neither formation had been purposely aimed at him, yet once he stepped in he felt suppressed; if they were used against the puppet, the pressure would only increase.

At that thought Yang Kai's lips curved into a slight smile — the greater the formations' power, the better for him; stronger suppression meant a better chance to bind and restrain the puppet's actions.

As soon as he stepped into the formations, the two Formation Masters altered their hand seals and drove a stream of Saint Yuan into the Formation Foundations beneath his feet. In the next instant the restraints and compressive force he had felt vanished and his freedom was restored.

Two Formation Masters managing the Mirror Lake Mud Dragon Formation and the Ground-Imprisonment Formation naturally wouldn't allow Yang Kai to be affected by them.

Yang Kai stepped forward again; his foot touched the mirrored lake and a ring of ripples spread out from beneath him. At the same time, the motionless puppet's eyes flashed with red light, it opened its huge mouth and spewed a pillar of crimson energy directly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's expression betrayed neither joy nor fear; with a movement of his foot he vanished from where he stood.

He had seen this attack many times while probing the puppet's abilities earlier and could not be easily struck by it.

Boom — the crimson energy struck the mirror-lake and only stirred greater ripples, unable to affect the Mirror Lake Mud Dragon Formation in the slightest, which eased Yang Kai's mind.

"Go!" Yang Kai called, and his Artifact Spirit Fire Bird immediately manifested, becoming a fiery crimson monstrosity ten or so zhang long that hurtled toward the giant puppet.

The puppet raised its pitch-black great staff and slammed it down at the Artifact Spirit; the staff's passage cut the air with a mournful howl, its force like an avalanche or tidal wave that made one's face blanch.

The staff's blow scattered the Artifact Spirit's form, but the Artifact Spirit was not a true physical being, so the attack did nothing to it. The scattered flames reformed, writhed, and once more took the shape of the Fire Bird, which opened its beak and spat out fireballs each larger than a washbasin that thundered toward the puppet.

A violent concussive roar followed; the puppet staggered under the barrage, its hulking body leaning back slightly.

Angered by the blow, the puppet's red-eyed fury intensified and it fixed its gaze on the Fire Bird, wielding its staff to engage the Artifact Spirit in a brutal clash. In an instant countless staff shadows appeared as crimson beams and scorching fireballs filled the sky.

These two were both existences far beyond the ordinary, yet at this moment they were locked in a fierce, unrelenting battle. The Artifact Spirit feared nothing from the opponent’s pitch-black giant cudgel, but it was wary of that crimson energy beam—whenever the puppet unleashed that kind of attack, it had no choice but to evade and wait for the right opportunity to strike back.

Yang Kai was delighted — the Artifact Spirit had fought hard during his tests earlier, and remarkably the puppet seemed to bear grudges: now it ignored him and relentlessly pursued the Artifact Spirit, which suited Yang Kai perfectly.

Seizing a chance, he flicked his hand and a golden filament shot straight for the puppet's left eye.

With a sharp clang, the indestructible golden thread struck precisely at the opponent’s left eye—but there, only a flash of fire flickered before the thread was instantly rebounded.

Yang Kai's brow tightened, and at that moment a low shout came from his ear: "Brother Yang, watch out!"

No sooner had the words sounded than the puppet swung its staff down toward him; the killing intent the staff carried almost seemed to freeze the very space.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and was about to dodge when he noticed a strange energy fluctuation in the mirror-lake beneath his feet; the once clear mirror surface suddenly turned turbid, and several roiling torrents of murky water rose up and took the form of jiao, surging to meet the staff.

At the same time, faint lights proliferated in the surroundings like swarming fireflies — starting few but in moments filling the sky like a locust swarm. Those lights swarmed at the staff and clung to it like bone-eating maggots.

Visibly, the staff's swinging speed instantly slowed considerably.

The mud-dragons that burst from the mirror-lake struck the staff and were smashed apart, but they still blunted a portion of its force.

Seeing this, Yang Kai's face brightened.

That scene made clear that the two formations were at work; his regard for the Mirror Lake Mud Dragon Formation and the Ground-Imprisonment Formation rose another notch and his confidence in being able to destroy the puppet strengthened.

If Cai He and Du Sisi truly collaborated with him, the chances of getting away from here would increase dramatically.

The staff continued to fall, but thanks to the formations' restraints Yang Kai easily avoided it. With a thought the Artifact Spirit Fire Bird reformed into a ball of flame, wrapping the puppet and burning it fiercely.

Yang Kai did not expect the Artifact Spirit to incinerate the puppet; he did not know of what material the puppet had been forged — it was impervious to water and fire, impervious to blades and spears, extremely sturdy. Even if the Artifact Spirit bore a trace of Sun's True Fire, it lacked the power to melt the puppet by flame alone.

Yang Kai merely wanted to rely on the Artifact Spirit’s unique form to locate where that wisp of Spirit Essence was hidden within the puppet’s body.

The Artifact Spirit burned itself out, yet the giant puppet was barely affected. Once the Artifact Spirit no longer drew its attention, it turned its gaze to Yang Kai and strode toward him.

Having only taken two strides, a huge whirlpool suddenly formed in the mirror-lake, swallowing one of its massive feet; the puppet's body tilted and it seemed poised to topple.

Yang Kai seized the opportunity, thrusting a palm forward as Saint Yuan surged, and his Heaven-Covering Palm struck down upon the puppet's head.

It must be said that Cai He and Du Sisi's two formations had greatly aided Yang Kai. Earlier, when he had been testing the puppet's power, danger had loomed at every turn; but now, with the three cooperating, he could dance around the puppet with ease and without much burden.

Under these circumstances he only needed to dodge the puppet's attacks while dividing his mind to perceive the messages the Artifact Spirit transmitted; once he found the spirit's hiding place he could recklessly strike that spot and shatter it to death.
