## Chapter 46 — When No One Is Around...

Yang Kai truly had no good way to deal with this woman’s relentless pestering. His only option was to ignore her. Hu Mei’er, sensing Yang Kai’s cold indifference, naturally dared not provoke him further, though she continued to follow him like a shadow.

Following the direction indicated by the Yang Source Seal, Yang Kai walked for a while before stopping in front of a stall.

Casting a brief glance, Yang Kai’s eyes brightened. He found that the items at this stall were quite good, and most suited his taste.

There were several round stones about the size of a baby’s fist, radiating a strong, scorching Yang energy. Compared to the previous stall, these stones were far more potent, though smaller in size.

The price shouldn’t be more expensive than the last stall, right? Yang Kai hesitated. The stall owner, however, greeted him warmly: “Young sir, what catches your eye? Everything here is of excellent quality and fair price. Don’t miss out whether you’re buying for yourself or to resell—it’s a guaranteed profitable deal.”

Summoning his courage, Yang Kai asked, “How much for these stones?”

The stall owner looked down, smiling: “You mean the Yang Flame Stones? Not expensive, five hundred taels each!”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened. Though he knew the price was reasonable, he still shook his head. “A bit pricey.”

After all, his entire possessions amounted to about five hundred taels.

The stall owner chuckled and shook his head. “Young sir, you jest. Everything here is clearly priced; I would never gouge customers. Just take a look at other stalls and see their prices—you’ll know how fair mine are.”

His words were honest. Yang Kai had inquired about prices at many stalls along the way. Though he hadn’t bought anything yet, he knew this owner’s prices were not high. But in business, bargaining was inevitable.

With no other choice, Yang Kai engaged the stall owner in a verbal duel, trying to negotiate a better price. Yet the owner shook his head persistently. Eventually, he sighed in frustration and said, “Young sir, these goods aren’t mine personally; I’m selling them on behalf of the gang. The price is fixed—I can’t sell for less or I’d have to cover the loss myself. Please don’t make things difficult for me.”

“The gang?” Yang Kai was taken aback and glanced at Hu Mei’er standing nearby.

There was only one gang in this area—the Blood Battle Gang.

Hu Mei’er smiled sweetly. “Yes, this is my family’s stall. Do you want these stones?”

Yang Kai nodded.

“Promise me one thing, and all these dozen or so stones can be yours!” Hu Mei’er’s eyes flickered mischievously.

“Miss…” The stall owner’s face changed drastically. If this batch of goods was lost, he would be in serious trouble.

“It’s fine, I’ll talk to my father,” Hu Mei’er reassured him. Hearing this, the stall owner fell silent.

“Well? Just promise me one thing,” Hu Mei’er said brightly, “It’s a simple thing for you men.”

“Not a chance!” Yang Kai refused outright. Even without thinking, he knew exactly what Hu Mei’er was after.

“You…” Hu Mei’er glared at Yang Kai, her eyes almost devouring him.

In truth, her interest in Yang Kai wasn’t very deep. But since her seductive advances that day failed to conquer him, she was frustrated—and on top of that, she had suffered a minor loss!

No man could resist her beauty! Hu Mei’er firmly believed this. She intended to make Yang Kai submit, and when that moment came, she would withdraw and enjoy watching his humiliation.

If Hu Mei’er wanted a man, she could summon a crowd with a mere flick of her finger. If not for other reasons, she wouldn’t have humiliated herself like this. She was flirtatious and unrestrained, but that was only a façade to confuse outsiders.

I refuse to believe I can’t conquer you! Hu Mei’er vowed fiercely in her heart.

Her eyes flicking, she told the stall owner, “Sell it to him cheaper!”

The stall owner grimaced. “That’s not right!”

“I said sell it cheaper!” Hu Mei’er bit her lip, a cold gleam flashing in her seductive eyes.

Just as the stall owner was about to nod, Yang Kai waved his hand. “No need. Five hundred taels.”

Buying at five hundred taels meant no profit, but no loss either—it was the market price.

As he spoke, he took out a bottle of Minor Recovery Pills. “Can I exchange this pill?”

Bartering was common here; finished pills generally circulated well.

“Sure,” the stall owner nodded.

“This bottle has ten pills, worth about five hundred taels. Count them,” Yang Kai tossed the pills to him, then picked up a Yang Flame Stone from the stall.

The moment he held it, Yang Kai felt a surge of Yang Yuan Qi. His heart leapt with joy, knowing this was a good deal.

Hu Mei’er ground her teeth in hatred. Yang Kai’s actions clearly showed he did not want to owe her a favor, rendering her earlier kindness futile.

The stall owner, reading the situation, realized the notorious young lady was probably scheming against Yang Kai. Though the deal was fair, the owner knew she was displeased. After some thought, he picked up an item from the stall and said, “Young sir, if you don’t mind, I’ll give you this seed as a gift. It’s worth very little anyway.”

“What kind of seed?” Yang Kai took it and sensed a faint Yang energy from within, though very weak.

“It’s the seed of the Three Yang Fruit. We found it while mining the Yang Flame Stones,” the owner explained honestly. “The fruit is a lower-level Earth-Grade spirit fruit, but it takes quite a long time to mature.”

Yang Kai chuckled silently. What use was a seed to him? It would take at least a decade to bear fruit. But since it was a kind gesture, he didn’t refuse. The seed was of little value, so accepting it did no harm.

“Thanks.” Yang Kai stood, pocketing the seed and the Yang Flame Stone.

With the Minor Recovery Pills gone, Yang Kai was unwilling to linger. After searching for Su Mu and the others without success, he set off alone toward the Black Wind Forest.

Behind him, Hu Mei’er refused to leave, trailing him like a tail, her face showing some annoyance.

He needed to find a way to shake her off. If she followed him all the way to Lingxiao Pavilion, who knew how others would view him? This woman’s reputation was hardly good.

Rolling his eyes, Yang Kai suddenly veered off the main path, heading deeper into the Black Wind Forest. As he walked, he glanced back at Hu Mei’er with a sinister grin, the meaning clear: if she dared follow, he would first ravage and kill her, then ravage and kill again. An evil aura radiated from him.

Hu Mei’er was chilled by his smile. Seeing Yang Kai actually enter the dense forest, she hesitated. She did not know him well; what if following him led to disaster? She had witnessed his strength that day and knew she was no match. If his beastly nature flared, she might end up battered and bruised.

After a moment’s hesitation, Hu Mei’er stomped her foot and twisted her waist, following him in. She was confident Yang Kai was only bluffing.

Seeing Hu Mei’er truly follow him, Yang Kai was instantly annoyed. His intention had been to scare her off, but this woman’s boldness ruined his plan. Anger surged within him, and a fierce resolve took hold: once they were alone, he would make her understand his power.
