## Chapter 597 — Who Exactly Is He?

“What’s the situation with that young lady?” Shan Qingluo asked cautiously again, her beautiful eyes casting a glance into the room.

“I have some history with her; she was the one who saved me,” Yang Kai answered casually.

“You didn’t touch her?” Shan Qingluo’s lips curved into a subtle, ambiguous smile.

“How would I have so much time to kill?” Yang Kai snorted, then his expression turned solemn again, “How is Zhongdu over there?”

“Everything is fine, save for your disappearance. But the ones closest to you have vanished too. Those left behind have no answers to give, so everyone is at a loss.”

Yang Kai slightly nodded; this situation was already within his expectations.

Seeing that Yang Kai showed little sorrow, Shan Qingluo suddenly realized that those few close to him who vanished were probably not in mortal danger; otherwise, he would not bear such a calm expression.

“That day... what exactly happened underground in Zhongdu? What about Yang Bai?” Shan Qingluo hesitated, asking with a hint of nervousness.

“It’s difficult to explain,” Yang Kai smiled bitterly and shook his head, unwilling to say more. “As for Yang Bai, he’s dead.”

“Dead?” Shan Qingluo’s beautiful eyes flickered with delight and excitement.

“Yes, dead. I saw it with my own eyes,” Yang Kai grinned.

Bilo clenched her fists tightly, exclaiming excitedly, “What a relief!”

“Yang Bai is dead, and you are safe. Then why haven’t you returned to Zhongdu these past six months? Why stay here instead?” Shan Qingluo looked at Yang Kai quietly, “What are you avoiding?”

“I’m not avoiding anything,” Yang Kai shook his head casually, “If I return to Zhongdu, I will bear all the burdens of Zhongdu’s affairs. Qiu Yimeng and the others will only see me as their pillar and lose their own will. Without me there, they can unleash their own abilities and properly act as heads of the Eight Great Families.”

Besides, Yang Kai also needed time to sort out his thoughts and make plans, which was why he had been hiding overseas for over half a year.

“You want to fade out of Zhongdu’s people’s sight?” Shan Qingluo mused, catching the meaning hidden in Yang Kai’s words.

“You could say that,” Yang Kai did not deny it, “Because I might leave here soon. They have relied on me too much; if I come, it won’t be good for them.”

“Where are you going?” The Enchantress Queen instantly became tense. She didn’t know why, but she had a feeling that once Yang Kai left, they might never see each other again. Her heart quietly filled with melancholy.

“I’ll tell you when the time comes,” Yang Kai smiled faintly. “But since you came today, I should return to Zhongdu to take a look.”

Saying so, his gaze suddenly turned to the side as he spoke, “Elder Han Zhao, since you’ve come, reveal yourself.”

Shan Qingluo smiled faintly, her eyes shifting toward the direction with calmness.

Elder Han Zhao had arrived long ago, almost the moment Shan Qingluo stepped foot on Gu Yun Island. However, the sudden appearance of such a bewitching woman made Han Zhao wary, so he secretly hid to observe and spy.

He wanted to figure out Shan Qingluo’s identity.

Unexpectedly, she had already sensed his aura.

Startled, Elder Han Zhao immediately realized that her strength far exceeded his own; otherwise, how could she see through his concealment at a glance? Without hesitation, he tried to flee.

At the same time, he let out a sharp whistle, warning others urgently.

Yang Kai looked helpless and gave Shan Qingluo a glance.

Shan Qingluo pointed a finger, and a thread-like energy shot out, instantly binding Elder Han Zhao, who was leaping through the air.

Thud... Elder Han Zhao fell to the ground, his True Yuan trapped inside him. When he got up again, his eyes trembled violently, staring disbelief at Shan Qingluo as he cried out, “Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?”

Elder Han Zhao’s cultivation was at the Divine Roaming Realm, Seventh Stage. Even a peak Divine Roaming Realm expert could not so casually bind him completely; the only ones capable of such a feat would be those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

He was not foolish and immediately guessed Shan Qingluo’s true cultivation.

Fear surged in his heart. He didn’t know why this bewitching and exceptionally strong woman suddenly came to Gu Yun Island, nor what her intention was.

Yang Kai leisurely walked toward him, stopping three zhang away, his expression calm as he stared him down.

“Release him,” Yang Kai commanded the Enchantress Queen.

Shan Qingluo poutingly pursed her red lips, then with a thought, the spider silk binding Elder Han Zhao vanished.

Elder Han Zhao looked warily at Shan Qingluo, his heart uneasy. Seeing no hostility from her, he relaxed a little and hesitated before asking, “May I inquire, what is your identity? What brings you to Gu Yun Island?”

“She came looking for me,” Yang Kai answered. “Elder Han Zhao, there’s no need for worry. She means no harm to Gu Yun Island.”

“Looking for you?” Elder Han Zhao was stunned, staring blankly at this seemingly ordinary registered disciple. His mind was in a whirl.

Since entering Gu Yun Island, Yang Kai had always appeared ordinary, showing no trace of cultivation, leading Elder Han Zhao to think he was just an ordinary fisherman. It was only because of Zhong Miaoke’s request that Yang Kai was allowed to stay on Gu Yun Island to look after his peacocks. No one expected such a man would actually draw the attention of a supreme expert beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

At this moment, even that top expert beyond the Divine Roaming Realm obeyed him alone.

What on earth was his identity?

Looking again at Yang Kai, Elder Han Zhao thought he saw behind him a blurred shadow as vast and heavy as a mountain.

Suddenly, the flutter of garments echoed from afar—it was Elder Han Zhao’s sharp whistle summoning Gu Feng, the island lord, and several other elders to gather.

Gu Feng was a burly man, broad-shouldered and thick-waisted, with a fierce demeanor. He held cultivation at the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. Most other elders were also at the Divine Roaming Realm’s Eighth or Ninth Stage.

These men were the foundation of Gu Yun Island and its most formidable experts.

“Elder Han Zhao, what’s going on?” Gu Feng arrived and bellowed sharply, with the other elders all alert and hostile.

Before Elder Han Zhao could answer, Gu Feng’s eyes suddenly brightened as he stared at Shan Qingluo, his face full of fascination. He exclaimed, “Is there truly such a woman in this world?!”

Not only Gu Feng was captivated; the other elders felt their hearts sway, their gazes dizzy, unable to resist Shan Qingluo’s seductive charm.

Gu Feng suddenly laughed heartily, “Where did you find this woman, Elder Han Zhao? This island lord accepts her—taking her as a concubine would be splendid!”

As he spoke, he charged at Shan Qingluo.

“Island Lord, no!” Elder Han Zhao’s face immediately darkened, and he hurried to stop him.

Thud...

Before anyone could react, Gu Feng was blasted away like a cannonball, screaming in panic as he fell into the nearby sea, splashing up waves.

No one knew how he was struck. They only vaguely saw Shan Qingluo’s hand move.

“Beyond the Divine Roaming Realm?” multiple elders gasped in shock. Their faces were pale as they no longer dared to belittle Shan Qingluo in the slightest.

Elder Han Zhao stared at the spot where Gu Feng fell, cold sweat streaming down his forehead.

It was over! The island lord had just harassed someone beyond the Divine Roaming Realm. Today, this Gu Yun Island would likely be soaked in blood and wiped out.

“Everyone here, if any of you dare covet my woman, it won’t be as simple as being blasted away!” Yang Kai stepped forward, coldly glaring at Gu Yun Island’s masters.

Clattering teeth sounded, and Elder Han Zhao snapped out of his stupor, quickly responding, “Understood!”

Yet his confusion deepened. This young man actually called that enchanting woman his own—and the other party didn’t deny it. What was going on?

Elder Han Zhao glanced stealthily at Shan Qingluo and shockingly found her face full of joyful happiness.

“I’m bold to inquire: what exactly is your purpose coming to Gu Yun Island?” Elder Han Zhao shivered but mustered courage to ask. Since half a year ago, this figure had been lurking on Gu Yun Island, only revealing his true terrifying nature today. What did he want? What on Gu Yun Island attracted such a person?

The other elders’ hearts also fluttered, gripped with worry. None dared to rescue the island lord fallen into the sea whose life was unknown.

“I simply happened to be stranded here. I do not wish to do anything to Gu Yun Island. I hope Elder Han Zhao will rest assured,” Yang Kai said thoughtfully. “Now, I need to see Li Yuanchun. Which of you can help summon him?”

“Li Yuanchun?” Elder Han Zhao frowned, then suddenly realized and exclaimed, “Senior Li of the Tai Yi Sect?”

“Yes. He should have already returned to Tai Yi Sect?” Yang Kai asked.

“About a month after that battle, Li Yuanchun and those from the overseas sects could not find you and then left Zhongdu,” Shan Qingluo gently replied.

“Good that he’s back,” Yang Kai nodded slightly, looking at Elder Han Zhao again.

Elder Han Zhao broke into a cold sweat, “Please forgive me, sir. I don’t even know your true identity, so how could I possibly meet Senior Li? Moreover, the Tai Yi Sect is a major power that we cannot casually visit. Senior Li is highly respected; I’m afraid... we cannot summon him. If you truly need to see Senior Li, perhaps you should go to the Tai Yi Sect yourself.”

He was eager to send Yang Kai away.

“You just have to tell him that Yang Kai wants to see him! Whether he comes or not is his own business.”

“Hurry then?” Shan Qingluo glared at him and scolded softly.

“Yes...” Elder Han Zhao nodded stiffly and took off flying toward the Tai Yi Sect’s location.

The pressure here was too intense, and what he had witnessed had surpassed his understanding. He wanted to escape as soon as possible.

As he flew, cold wind blew, and Elder Han Zhao suddenly noticed his back was wet.

After Elder Han Zhao left, the remaining elders exchanged uneasy glances. One shrewder elder said, “Before Elder Han Zhao returns, sir, why not deign to rest for a while at the Spirit-Nourishing Hall? We can offer some hospitality.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

“Please!”
