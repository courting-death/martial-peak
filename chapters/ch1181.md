## Chapter 1181 — Sneak Attack

Not being able to fly was truly unbearable; the fissure was a thousand zhang deep, so even if Yang Kai moved with great speed, climbing out would still take him about half an hour. Fortunately he had gained something and was in a fairly good mood, so he didn't fuss over it.

Half an hour later Yang Kai finally returned to the surface. After steadying himself he drew out the Yuan Magnetic Pointer from his Spatial Ring to confirm the direction.

But before he could move again, an omen flashed through his heart; his flesh unconsciously tightened and an unimaginable sense of crisis descended from above.

The sensation was as if Death itself was beckoning him.

In haste, Yang Kai stirred his Saint Yuan and flashed to one side.

A crimson light, swift as a startled swan, streaked over from a direction and struck Yang Kai in the chest.

The tremendous force sent Yang Kai flying; the bones of his chest ached unbearably. Under that strange attack Yang Kai found that he had indeed been wounded, and the injury was not light!

Before his body hit the ground, his vast Divine Sense had already frantically spread out and instantly locked onto the source of the sneak attack.

At a glance, murderous intent surged in Yang Kai's heart like a tide!

It turned out to be that fool Xie Hongwen, and beside him were the two Third Stage of the Saint King Realm warriors Yang Kai had seen before — the pair the Xie Family had sent to protect him. One of them now looked exhausted, holding a crossbow-shaped Secret Treasure; that Secret Treasure gave off an extremely strange aura as if it were crazily sucking his Saint Yuan, leaving him growing ever more drained. Yang Kai also clearly saw a crimson gash on the hand of the crossbow-wielder, fresh blood flowing from it into the crossbow. The blood vanished as it was poured in, making the Secret Treasure flush blood-red like a savage beast.

The other hurriedly took several Pills from his Spatial Ring and forced them into the weakened warrior's mouth.

As for Xie Hongwen, he seemed to think his deed had succeeded. He excitedly stood up from the hill where he'd hidden, looking this way with elation and expectation, waving his arms and loudly cheering.

But upon seeing Yang Kai drop down and not collapse, Xie Hongwen froze and stood dumbfounded.

Yang Kai did not immediately seek to make trouble for them. Xie Hongwen was not worth fearing, and the warrior who had used the crossbow Secret Treasure to launch the sneak attack looked like he was at the end of his tether — probably even moving was difficult. In Yang Kai's eyes they were already dead; as for the remaining Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, Yang Kai believed killing him should be no trouble with his abilities.

He hurriedly checked his injuries.

In his chest was lodged a small, exquisite arrow exuding Spiritual Qi, buried more than three cun in; it seemed to have struck a lobe of his lung, making his breathing feel as if his whole lung were burning with pain.

He felt both shocked and relieved — shocked that the enemy possessed such a strange Secret Treasure capable of delivering such a powerful strike, relieved that he had sensed a trace of danger early and avoided the vital spot.

No question about it: the blow had aimed for his heart, but because of his movement it struck the right part of his chest and only wounded the lung — by sheer luck.

His robust flesh had been key to withstanding the blow. If his flesh had not condensed, such a strike would have pierced him through!

Yang Kai's face turned ashen and killing intent radiated from him without concealment. He reached out to pull the arrow from his right chest, but it dissolved without a trace, leaving only a bleeding hole from which a little Golden Blood flowed; the life force carried within that Golden Blood quickly began to repair the wound.

He looked up toward the hill, then walked step by step in that direction.

Xie Hongwen collapsed onto the ground, his face white as paper, trembling as he stammered, "Xie... Xie..."

After stammering for so long he couldn't bring himself to call out the name of either of the two warriors who had protected him.

Xie Jun, thinking he was concerned for his weakness, forced a smile and said, "Young Master needn't worry; I can recover in a month or two. Using that Secret Treasure requires paying such a price!"

It was precisely because he possessed such a strange Secret Treasure that he had absolute confidence in ambushing and killing Yang Kai.

No sooner had he finished speaking than the crossbow Secret Treasure that had been attached to his wound finally fell off and stopped sucking his blood.

Xie Hongwen wanted to curse aloud, thinking, How could I care about you? Even if you die, what business is it of mine.

In his panic his words came out sharp; he cried, "He's coming."

"What?" Xie Jun and Xie Yong's faces changed as they turned to look, and indeed they saw Yang Kai approaching wrapped in murderous qi; each of his footsteps seemed to press on the three men's fragile nerves, making them nearly jump out of their skins.

"Impossible!" Xie Jun's eyes widened in disbelief. "He can't still be alive!"

He knew better than anyone how his Secret Treasure's attack worked.

And his timing had been well chosen. Although he did not understand how Yang Kai could have survived and crawled out of that fissure, the other had clearly fought for over a day, his Saint Yuan nearly exhausted, his body tattered and scarred — he looked utterly disheveled — so he attacked without hesitation.

Such a strange strike — no one below the Origin Returning Realm could withstand it! Even in the Origin Returning Realm, if one's use of Shi was not proficient, death was certain. Only the Shi of Origin Returning Realm experts could resist that blow!

Yet no matter how incredulous he felt, the fact was before his eyes: Yang Kai truly was still alive, and his injuries seemed negligible.

This caused the already-weak Xie Jun to instantly lose all strength and collapse to the ground.

Just what kind of monster had that idiot Xie Hongwen provoked? Even their sure-kill strike couldn’t do a thing to him— and yet Xie Hongwen still wanted revenge? Fine if he wanted to die, but dragging them down with him— what the hell was that supposed to be?

"Xie Yong... what are you doing?" Xie Hongwen suddenly called out.

Xie Jun turned his head weakly and gave a bitter smile.

Xie Yong, without a word, deserted in the face of battle and fled, running like the wind. It seemed he too understood this Yang Kai was not to be trifled with, so he fled with all haste. At their level of cultivation one had an instinctive sense of danger; Xie Yong must have sensed something amiss to act so.

"Xie Yong, you crawl back here!" Xie Hongwen dared not face Yang Kai and yet treated Xie Yong without mercy, trying to keep him behind for a sliver of security as he shouted, "If you dare run, I'll report you to my father and have you punished by the family's laws!"

Xie Yong paid him no heed and ran even faster.

"Don't waste your breath. If you want to live, run — though I don't know if you'll get away," Xie Jun said faintly. Knowing himself surely doomed, his expression was oddly calm. "Hm, I guess you won't escape. You're dead for sure. Hahaha, I never thought I'd go to the Yellow Springs with a fool like you — what a shame!"

In the original plan, after Xie Jun used that strike, Xie Yong was supposed to ensure his safety. But now Xie Yong had run; even if Yang Kai did not kill him, alone he could not survive in the Flowing Flame Sandland.

He would not expect Xie Hongwen to take care of him.

Xie Hongwen paused, then glared savagely at Xie Jun. "What did you call me? You dare call me a fool? You..."

Xie Hongwen suddenly fell silent when he saw the Xie Family disciple who had always obeyed him now looking at him with mockery and scorn, the same disdain he had once shown when staring at ants crawling on the ground.

A ripping sound split the air. Xie Hongwen screamed and collapsed to the ground; when he raised his head he found Yang Kai standing silently before him, heavy as a mountain.

The Flowing Flame Sandland was blistering hot, yet Xie Hongwen felt an icy chill, as if he had fallen into an ice cellar that froze his soul; he couldn't help trembling.

A high, sonorous dragon roar sounded. Xie Hongwen widened his eyes to see a pitch-black giant dragon shake its head and tail as it issued from Yang Kai's body, then give chase toward the direction Xie Yong had fled.

Before long fierce fighting and Xie Yong's shouts came from that direction.

Gradually the noise subsided and Xie Yong's cries weakened until they vanished.

In an instant the pitch-black giant dragon returned from that direction and flowed back into Yang Kai's body.

Needless to say, Xie Hongwen knew the fate that had befallen Xie Yong. He suddenly began to weep softly, looking at Yang Kai with a pleading face, his lips moving as if begging for mercy but no sound came out.

His courage was sucked dry in that moment.

Yang Kai looked at Xie Hongwen with icy eyes; this trash had secretly arranged an ambush against him and even managed to injure him.

“Last time you escaped with your life; you should be thanking Qian Tong properly. But you squandered that chance and chose to seek death—fine, I’ll grant you that!” Yang Kai, disgusted, couldn’t be bothered to look at Xie Hongwen’s nauseating face any longer. He waved his hand; a surge of Demonic Flame enveloped Xie Hongwen, and in the blink of an eye reduced him to ashes.

From start to finish, Xie Hongwen had not once thought of resisting; one truly could not see what he had cultivated all those years for.

The Demonic Flame devours all; even Xie Hongwen's soul was gone—truly annihilated.

Yang Kai then looked at Xie Jun. This man was somewhat interesting — knowing he was surely doomed, he showed no fear, only a trace of shock when Xie Yong died.

He had not expected Yang Kai could kill Xie Yong without personally lifting a finger.

Such strength deviated greatly from their original estimates!
