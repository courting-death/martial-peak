## Chapter 1870 — Second Venerable One

At that moment, the man was still holding a wine jug; it was filled to the brim with fine liquor, its fragrance spilling into the air.

After exchanging a move with Gongsun Liang, not a drop of the wine in the jug had spilled.

He looked at Gongsun Liang with a smile and said, "Great Elder, hope you have been well."

Gongsun Liang’s expression grew solemn. He looked at the man and said, “Li Maoming! So you really are in Purple Star City. It seems the one standing behind the Second Young Master, propping him up, is you?”

The man called Li Maoming chuckled at the words. "Great Elder, you overstate it. As Purple Star's Second Venerable One, I cannot stand by when such a great matter occurs in Purple Star. As for backing up the Second Young Master, uh… that's not the right way to put it — I was merely entrusted by someone."

Gongsun Liang sneered, "If anyone could move you, it would only be that person, right, Li Maoming? After so many years you still haven't gotten over it — it truly puzzles this old man."

A dim look flashed across Li Maoming's eyes; he shook his head and gave a wry laugh. "I do not understand either. Let us not speak of it today. Great Elder, why not come with me for a few cups of flower wine and we can sit down and talk it over? We're all family — why resort to blades and blood and make things so awkward?"

As he spoke, he even lifted the wine jug and made a gesture toward Gongsun Liang, as if truly inviting him to drink.

The atmosphere, which had been on the verge of explosion, was stirred by Li Maoming and cooled into something more peaceful.

Some of Purple Star's high-ranking figures frowned as they looked at Li Maoming floating in midair, puzzled; although Purple Star had had two Venerable Ones before, no one had known who those two Venerable Ones actually were.

And now it seemed clear that this Li Maoming was evidently one of them.

"So it's him! I remember now," someone suddenly said with a look of realization, whispering.

Immediately someone beside him asked, "Brother Zhang, do you recognize this Venerable One?"

"I've only heard of him, never seen him; this is my first time seeing him," the warrior surnamed Zhang replied in a low voice.

"Brother Zhang, tell me, what is this Venerable Li's background? Why did the Great Elder say it's been so many years and he still hasn't gotten over it?"

Hearing the question, the warrior surnamed Zhang suddenly came alive, his face animated as he whispered, "This is a secret only a few know. Tell me, have you ever heard of the Second Young Master's mother?"

"She was the First Beauty of Purple Star in those days, famed far and wide — how could I not have heard of her?"

"That explains it. I heard the woman Venerable Li admired was the Second Young Master's mother."

"What?" The warrior was shocked and said in astonishment, "But the Second Young Master's mother is not with the Lord…"

"Indeed. Back then this Venerable Li fought alongside the Lord as a sworn brother, but because of the Second Young Master's mother… ah, you know how men and women are — matters of the heart are left to fate. In the end the First Beauty of Purple Star chose the Lord, and this Venerable Li disappeared into seclusion. Even the Lord did not know his whereabouts. So if anyone in this world could move him, it would only be the Second Young Master's mother."

"I see. With this Venerable One guarding, surely the Great Elder will no longer be able to deal with the Second Young Master," said the speaker, exhilarated; after all, he stood on Zi Wuji's side, and the stronger Zi Wuji's forces were, the safer he would be.

"Perhaps," the warrior surnamed Zhang admitted; though he knew some secrets, he was not very confident.

"Li Maoming, if you leave now, another day I will drink with you and we will be merry," Gongsun Liang said, staring at Li Maoming in a low voice. "How about that proposal?"

Li Maoming slowly shook his head. “I was entrusted with a task, so I carry it out faithfully — nothing more, nothing less.” He lifted his wine cup and drained it in one go, then tossed it aside, his interest fading as he sighed, “A cup of wine means nothing without a kindred spirit to share it with.”

Gongsun Liang frowned slightly and pondered for a long moment before saying, "What if I ask you to repay a favor from long ago?"

At those words, Zi Wuji, who had been brimming with pride, changed color and stared at Li Maoming in alarm. "Venerable Li, you owe that old thing a favor?"

Li Maoming blinked, thought earnestly for a moment, then let out a soft laugh. "Uh, I do indeed owe him a favor — if the Great Elder hadn't mentioned it, I might have forgotten."

Gongsun Liang's mouth curled slightly. "Brother Li may have forgotten, but I have not — that favor was not small; I paid a considerable price back then."

Li Maoming straightened his expression and clasped his fists. “The Great Elder’s kindness from back then — Li has always kept it in mind.”

"Then that makes it easy. I want you to leave now, and thereafter we will be square."

Li Maoming made no immediate reply, and Zi Wuji hurriedly said, "No, Venerable Li, do not forget what you promised that person."

Li Maoming frowned slightly and nodded. "I remember, of course. Rest assured, with me here, no one can harm you."

Zi Wuji was overjoyed. "Thank you, Senior Li."

Gongsun Liang snapped angrily, "Brother Li, you are breaking your word."

Li Maoming rubbed his temples. “Great Elder, everything has its order. I agreed to safeguard the Second Young Master first. If you press me like this, you’re putting Li in a very difficult position.”

Gongsun Liang was greatly enraged, but after pondering Li Maoming's words, a sharp light sparked in his eyes as he said, "So you are determined to guarantee the Second Young Master's safety?"

"Exactly!" Li Maoming nodded solemnly. "After all, the Second Young Master carries the blood of the Zi Family; nothing can be allowed to go wrong."

"Good!" Gongsun Liang laughed heartily. "In that case, you protect him — I will not touch him!"

As he spoke, Gongsun Liang waved his hand with a cold laugh. "Seize the people beside the Second Young Master — be careful not to hurt the Second Young Master!"

"Yes!" Those present responded and charged toward Zi Wuji, but none struck at Zi Wuji himself; each instead targeted a warrior who had followed Zi Wuji.

Zi Wuji, before he had time to react, was swept into the fray and shouted in disarray.

In an instant, a protracted battle erupted over the Purple Star Palace, a kaleidoscope of Saint Yuan light and the ceaseless might of Secret Treasures flashing and dazzling the eyes, as the world's Yuan Qi churned and trembled.

Zi Wuji's eyes widened as he looked at Li Maoming in panic. "Venerable Li, how can you act like this?"

Li Maoming glanced at him cheerfully and said, "Second Young Master, I promised that person to protect your safety, so I will keep my word; but as for the life and death of others here, Li Maoming will not concern himself."

Zi Wuji was furious but had no retort. He turned and saw that the experts he had rallied were all mired in bitter combat and were as frantic as ants on a hot pan.

Li Maoming added, "Well, the overall situation is settled. Second Young Master, why don't I take you for a few cups of wine to calm your nerves?"

"If you want to drink, go drink by yourself," Zi Wuji snapped inwardly; he would never agree to such a ridiculous suggestion.

In the sky, the battle fell into a stalemate. Since Zi Wuji had chosen today to reveal himself and challenge Gongsun Liang, the power he held was not insignificant and could essentially match Gongsun Liang. Once the two fought, it became a balance of forces; it was impossible to tell who was stronger.

Yet… Gongsun Liang had not yet struck!

As a Second Stage of the Void King Realm, once he entered the fray his presence would certainly tilt the scales toward victory.

Just as Zi Wuji's thought of fear had barely formed, Gongsun Liang's figure flickered and he darted to the side of the Third Elder.

The Third Elder, at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, had been among the first to side with Zi Wuji and was regarded as a trusted aide. Yet after being targeted by Gongsun Liang, he was suddenly in dire straits and on the verge of defeat.

Zi Wuji's face darkened as he roared, "Venerable Yang, please act!"

No sooner had he spoken than a figure flashed through the air — Yang Kai calmly appeared beside Gongsun Liang, sighed slightly, and launched a palm at Gongsun Liang.

Yang Kai himself was extremely vexed.

He had gained a great haul from the Purple Star treasure vault and intended to slip away after washing the place clean; after all, his goals had been achieved and he had no need to further entangle himself in Zi Wuji's troubles.

The people of the Five Commerce Guilds and the Tongtian Auction House, and Li Nuo among others, had already been quietly briefed by him and were prepared — they would leave Purple Star with him once he slipped away.

But he had not expected Shen Tu and the others to have been moved away by Zi Wuji.

Yang Kai could not instantly locate Shen Tu and the others, so he quietly released a Stone Puppet to search for their whereabouts.

Hearing Zi Wuji’s shout now, he could only put on a front and go along with it for the moment.

As Yang Kai appeared, a flash of sharp light crossed Li Maoming's eyes; he stared unblinkingly and his heart shook.

He had long sensed that there was another Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert within the Purple Star Palace, but he had not been able to determine how Yang Kai had appeared here.

It seemed this Venerable Yang had the ability to cross spatial barriers!

The thought made Li Maoming look grave; the earlier relaxed ease vanished as he said in a low voice, "Second Young Master, is this the much-rumored Third Venerable One?"

"Exactly." Seeing Yang Kai's arrival, Zi Wuji's expression at last calmed. "Venerable Li, what do you think of Venerable Yang's strength?"

"Very strong," Li Maoming said in a low voice. "His Saint Yuan is majestic, surpassing both the Great Elder and myself by a degree."

Zi Wuji smiled and asked, "So the Great Elder is no match for him?"

Li Maoming slowly shook his head. "A warrior's strength cannot be judged by Saint Yuan alone; there are many other factors, but… with this man holding the Great Elder in check, the Great Elder will have a hard time."

"If Venerable Li can lend his strength as well, today's affair will surely be decided," Zi Wuji's eyes shone as he looked at Li Maoming.

Li Maoming shook his head with a wry smile. "I only promised to protect your safety. The people here are brothers of Purple Star — how could I strike them?"

Zi Wuji's brow knit, a flicker of inner struggle in his eyes, and finally he said in a low voice, "If I help you pursue my mother and let you win the beauty's hand, will you then join the fight?"

Li Maoming's face turned dark. He glared at Zi Wuji and snapped, "What did you just say? “Do you understand that what you just said tarnishes your own mother’s name? If I hear anything like it again, I’ll break your arms and legs!”
