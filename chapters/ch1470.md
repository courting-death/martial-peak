## Chapter 1470 — Yuanwu Soul-Summoning Array

While Yang Kai, Shan Qingluo and the experts of the Hengluo Commerce Guild were locked in bitter, all-consuming combat, bloodshed and murder were erupting in succession throughout the Imperial Garden.

Not even those at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could guarantee their own safety.

Although everyone knew the Imperial Garden was riddled with danger, the manifold opportunities hidden within kept drawing them in; countless martial artists entered. When cultivators from different worlds and different forces met, clashes were inevitable, usually ending in total victory for one side and death for the losers.

In one place where a Blazing Flame burned, flames rolled in every direction and the inferno reached to the heavens; even those at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm could not easily withstand the searing heat. The burning was not a real fire at all but the wonder of an illusionary array.

Yet those trapped inside felt it as real as if immersed in the flames. At this moment within the illusionary array, three experts of the Origin Returning Realm sat cross-legged, jointly releasing Saint Yuan to form a protective dome, battling the fire to hold on.

They had held out here for four or five days, but still could not break the wondrous array and escape. Countless Saint Crystals and Pills had been consumed; their own Saint Yuan was insufficient. The surrounding Blazing Flame, however, coiled toward them like venomous serpents. As time passed and forces waxed and waned, the three’s situation grew ever more perilous.

Finally, one of the three exhausted their Saint Yuan; the protective Saint Yuan light about their body flickered and popped like a bubble.

The man’s face changed drastically; the other two screamed and frantically urged their powers. They tried to mend the breach, but everything was in vain. Previously the three had barely scraped by together; now, with one drained, the flames that surrounded them instantly surged like waves and overwhelmed them.

Shrill screams rose and then were quickly stilled. When the flames subsided, only three skeletons remained, without obvious wounds—yet utterly devoid of life. Such was the treachery of the illusionary array.

Elsewhere, in a labyrinthine place Yang Kai had passed through earlier, a sect’s cultivators hugged together in a tight cluster, protecting one another’s flanks and fighting bravely.

Their foes were not living beings but the ancient puppets unique to the Imperial Garden; the energy fluctuations emitted by each puppet reached the Origin Returning Realm, and some even equaled the Third Stage.

Though they lacked much intelligence and fought clumsily, their sheer numbers were terrifying.

Frankly, this sect fielded a sizable number of cultivators—five dozen in all—and their strength was not weak, yet in such maze-like terrain, surrounded and trapped by myriad puppets, there was nowhere to turn.

The battle raged for half a day; the ground was littered with the parts and fragments of shattered puppets, and blood stained the earth.

One by one the cultivators fell, struck down by the puppets. After half a day the tumultuous maze fell silent. The nameless sect was annihilated. When no living breath could be detected, the battered puppets quietly vanished as if they had never been there.

Many cultivators had died beneath the Imperial Garden’s forbidden arrays and the puppets’ blows.

Yet more had perished in fights among themselves and from sneak attacks.

Often the appearance of a single treasure could trigger a bloodbath. Within the Imperial Garden there were no rules or morality—only strength could speak. Whoever was stronger could survive; brutal, bloody fights occurred almost without pause.

If a peerless expert could fly above the Imperial Garden and look down, they would see it was a vast palace shaped like an octagon, with the buildings inside arranged according to some arcane pattern, as if concealing some miraculous law.

At this moment, in a palace at the very center of the Imperial Garden, two women stood silently. One wore a black robe, appearing mysterious and eerie; the other had a graceful figure and dignified beauty, her entire presence exuding the overwhelming aura of a peak Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm master. Yet even such a powerhouse stood thirty zhang behind the black-robed woman, looking at her back with boundless reverence.

Yang Yan and Ye Xijun!

No one knew when they had arrived at this palace, or what purpose had brought them here. From their neat garments and calm expressions it seemed they had encountered no peril and had not fought along the way.

The Imperial Garden appeared unguarded toward them, allowing them to come here with ease.

The palace was vast, spanning more than ten thousand zhang across.

Yet inside there was only one object: a not-very-large white jade crystal coffin. Though it bore no visible empowerment, the coffin hovered in midair, oddly uncanny.

Yang Yan now stood before the white jade crystal coffin, silently gazing into it, her expression complex.

Lying inside the coffin was a figure—by body shape it was clearly a woman, and her face was identical to Yang Yan’s. If Yang Kai were present, he would certainly be able to tell what kind of existence the woman in the coffin really was.

The Starry Sky Emperor!

The mighty being who had once unified the entire Star Domain tens of thousands of years ago, her legend remained familiar to all. The Star Emperor Tokens she forged was coveted by the great forces, treated as a Sect’s Treasure and seldom used—only when facing extinction would one summon it and unleash the divine art sealed within by the Emperor.

Her status was exalted; she could blot out the sky with a single hand—she was the pinnacle of the entire Star Domain!

Yet no one knew the famed Starry Sky Emperor was female—perhaps her gender had long been forgotten by the world, or perhaps no one had ever seen her true face—yet her renown endured through the ages.

Staring at the woman in the coffin, Yang Yan felt as if she were looking into a mirror; their bodies and faces were indistinguishable, the only difference being their temperament.

Even in slumber the Emperor’s countenance exuded majesty, a nobility too lofty to be stared at directly, as if merely gazing upon her was a great transgression.

"So this is what I look like," Yang Yan murmured softly.

"Lord!" Ye Xijun called out, thinking Yang Yan was about to give an order.

"Nothing," Yang Yan replied calmly. "I was only talking to myself."

Ye Xijun dared not speak further; she bowed her head and stood waiting.

Yang Yan drew in a light breath, glanced around, and sighed softly: "The Yuanwu Soul-Summoning Array should be ready to activate soon."

At that moment, deep and complex runes began to shimmer one after another across the palace floor and walls. As each rune lit, the palace gradually filled with a profound energy. Standing there, Ye Xijun could faintly hear a beautiful melody at her ear, as if someone were calling her; she felt a sudden urge to send her Spirit Body out of her flesh.

The thought caused Ye Xijun to break out in a cold sweat.

A Spirit Body was fragile and normally concealed within the Sea of Consciousness; ordinary cultivators did not send it forth except in dire peril. Once separated, if it could not find a suitable host, the Spirit Body would dissipate within half a day and the spirit would be utterly extinguished.

Ye Xijun had never heard of the Yuanwu Soul-Summoning Array and did not know its uses, but from the situation she could deduce it was certainly related to the Emperor’s awakening.

As more and more cultivators perished within the Imperial Garden, the number of dim runes lighting within the palace increased; it seemed the Yuanwu Soul-Summoning Array relied on the deaths of those outside, using their lives as its power source.

Yang Yan could never commit such a thing herself—but the Emperor could.

The Imperial Garden had been opened to the entire Star Domain; anyone who entered should be prepared to perish. Those who sought treasures here naturally faced great risk.

No one forced them into the Imperial Garden; it was voluntary. Now that they fell and became the Yuanwu Soul-Summoning Array’s activation fuel, there was nothing to complain about.

For the sake of her awakening, what did a few deaths matter? To the Emperor, those at the Origin Returning Realm might be less than ants.

Seeing only a dozen or so runes left unlit, Yang Yan could not help turning to glance toward the entrance.

But the passageway was empty—no one came.

Even the hope of seeing him one last time had become a luxury...

Time passed like lightning; in what felt like the blink of an eye the palace erupted in brilliance. All the runes were lit and the Yuanwu Soul-Summoning Array arranged here thundered into operation.

One by one the runes flew out from all corners of the palace like meteors racing the moon, magnificent and terrible, converging upon Yang Yan’s delicate form.

Yang Yan could not help but show an expression of pain.

Ye Xijun watched in a daze, but she could do nothing to help; even moving a finger felt impossible. She had become a mere spectator, forced to witness this heart-rending, historic moment.

"Elder Ye..." Yang Yan’s call came suddenly from that direction.

Ye Xijun quickly replied, "I am here!"

“No matter what I become in the future, you must continue to assist Yang Kai well!”

Ye Xijun was stunned, then gritted her teeth and answered, "I will obey your command, Lord!"

Yang Yan’s command was tantamount to the Emperor’s decree; she would not question the reason, only obey.

In the dazzling white light Ye Xijun thought she glimpsed a faint, joyful smile. Then the radiance swelled and wrapped Yang Yan entirely, forming a sphere of light that drifted serenely into the white jade crystal coffin. Yang Yan disappeared from where she had stood.

In the next moment the palace fell silent once more, as if nothing had occurred.

The lit runes faded and the Yuanwu Soul-Summoning Array ceased its operation; the main hall now held only Ye Xijun alone and the white jade crystal coffin suspended in midair.
