## Chapter 692 — The Patriarch?

Tianxiao Sect, inside a sealed chamber.

Cang Yan stood respectfully in place, reporting to the Patriarch all that had occurred after meeting Yang Kai.

Upon hearing that Yang Kai had slain Duan Hai and Xu Qi in front of Xia Chengyin, the Patriarch of Tianxiao Sect could not help but brighten visibly, a meaning-laden smile appearing on his lips.

He then asked about what had been encountered inside that predecessor’s cave dwelling; the Patriarch was astonished: "He possesses Divine Sense Fire?"

Cang Yan nodded gravely. "Patriarch, you did not know?"

"I did not." The old man shook his head slowly. "I only had a vague sense that this matter required him to resolve, so when you were about to return I had Fei Yu hurry over."

"So the Patriarch has never met that youngster either?"

"Hm, I have not met him, but he... has some connection with me."

Cang Yan looked puzzled, clearly unable to fathom what sort of connection Yang Kai could possibly have with the Patriarch.

"Those who know he possesses Divine Sense Fire — besides you and Du Wan, Xia Chengyin knows as well, does he not?" the Patriarch asked calmly.

Cang Yan's expression turned solemn and he inclined his head slightly. "Yes. That little girl from the Alchemists' Association knows too, and on the way back Fei Yu also saw it."

"I understand. You may go."

"Disciple takes his leave!" Cang Yan bowed and withdrew; once he stepped out of the sealed chamber he stared for a moment in the direction of the Leiguang Divine Cult, a cold smile curling the corner of his mouth.

……

Yang Kai remained inside Tianxiao Sect for two straight days; only Fei Yu paid him a single visit, Cang Yan's whereabouts were unknown, and no one else came to see him.

Fei Yu presented him with a jar of Thousand Red Flower Wine as a token of thanks for his help in that cave dwelling.

The beautiful woman was a little wanton and uninhibited; when she came to see Yang Kai she was drunken, reeking of wine, her cheeks flushed, and a peculiar redness glowed at the long column of her neck, highly alluring.

"Don't drink too much at once, your little frame won't hold up," Fei Yu teased coquettishly, set down the Thousand Red Flower Wine, then vanished without a trace, whereabouts unknown.

Yang Kai smiled helplessly; he didn't even get the chance to probe her for information, and could only tuck the Thousand Red Flower Wine into the Black Book Space and continue to stroll slowly in the courtyard.

To outsiders it looked like a casual walk, neither hasty nor slow, but his flesh and blood writhed visibly, as if under immense, unmatched pressure.

Yet strangely, where his feet fell there was nothing out of the ordinary — he left no traces.

Three days later Cang Yan suddenly reappeared, waved at Yang Kai and said, "The Patriarch wishes to see you."

Yang Kai's expression brightened and he hurried over at once.

He had many perplexing questions to ask, and he very much wanted to know what kind of man the Patriarch of Tianxiao Sect really was.

Not far into the walk, Cang Yan glanced at him oddly and asked in surprise, "You're nervous?"

"No." Yang Kai shook his head.

"Then why has your True Yuan been surging? And your flesh and blood are taut... no—" Cang Yan's face suddenly changed; he stared deeply at Yang Kai and exclaimed in astonishment, "Fei Yu gave you the Hunyuan Shackles?"

"Those are called the Hunyuan Shackles?"

Cang Yan nodded slightly. "The more True Yuan poured into them, the heavier the shackles become. How much weight are you carrying now?"

"About four or five thousand jin, I think."

"You truly are strange." Cang Yan's face showed astonishment. "Have you ever specially trained your body before?"

"I have."

The Indomitable Golden Body Technique is specifically for developing bodily strength; now that he bore four or five thousand jin of weight, aside from feeling slightly awkward Yang Kai showed little difference from normal—he even left no marks on the ground when he walked.

Cang Yan clicked his tongue in wonder; he himself had once worn Fei Yu's Hunyuan Shackles, but at Yang Kai's present level he admitted he could not be so calm and unaffected.

How could a pill-refiner possess such formidable bodily strength?

Alchemists, immersed for years in the path of pill-refining, rarely have time to cultivate; thus almost all alchemists are weak in combat—when facing warriors of the same rank, the alchemist will invariably lose.

Yet Yang Kai had previously slain Duan Hai and Xu Qi, and had entered and exited the Wind Eye and Thunder Eye; Cang Yan had seen this and faintly felt that this youngster was more than merely a Spirit-Grade alchemist who possessed Divine Sense Fire.

After walking for some time, Cang Yan stopped before a dwelling and said, "You may go in. The Patriarch waits inside."

Yang Kai nodded slightly, drew in a breath, and strode forward.

He entered the room, turned a corner, and deeper inside the sealed chamber a candle quivered, its flame seeming on the verge of being snuffed.

The chamber was dimly lit; an emaciated old man with white beard and whiskers sat cross-legged, his figure thin, his aura settled and undisturbed, nothing outwardly remarkable.

Yang Kai's face grew solemn—this was undoubtedly the Patriarch of Tianxiao Sect—and he approached while studying him.

When he drew near he bowed, "Junior Yang Kai pays respects to Senior!"

The old man slowly opened his eyes, regarded Yang Kai for a moment and smiled kindly, "Good aptitude, commendable perseverance, and you have courage and mettle—such young men are rare now."

"You flatter me, Senior."

"Sit."

Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the mat in front of him; once seated he suddenly shifted, for he faintly caught the scent of blood in the air.

"I know you have many questions. Don't rush to ask—open the parcel before you," the old man said with a smile.

Yang Kai looked down and indeed saw a parcel before him, from which seeped fresh blood, and the scent of blood was coming from that parcel.

Yang Kai frowned slightly but did not hesitate; he casually opened the parcel, and when he saw what was inside he looked up in shock at the Patriarch of Tianxiao Sect.

It was a human head!

The head of Leiguang's sect leader, Xia Chengyin!

“Before you mature, no one should expose the secret that you possess Divine Sense Fire,” the old man said with a smile.

"Thank you for your intervention, Senior!" Yang Kai hurried to express his gratitude.

He had intended to wait until he ascended to the Transcendent Realm before killing to silence him, but the Patriarch of Tianxiao Sect had helped him accomplish this ahead of time, lifting a weight from Yang Kai's heart.

At the time he had been helpless and thus had revealed the secret of his Divine Sense Fire, because he thought information on the Ancient Demon Clan and the Coffin-Bearer was even more important not to leak.

"It was a small matter." The old man shook his head lightly.

With his means and strength, killing a Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm Leiguang sect leader truly was nothing; Xia Chengyin's head had already fallen before he could react.

"Senior," Yang Kai sat up straight and said in a steady voice, "may I ask why? Why did you send Cang Yan to find me, why does Cang Yan treat me so well, and why did you even kill the Leiguang sect leader for me? It seems we have never met before, right?"

"Heh heh." The old man smiled. "I did this for a reason. Ah—my name is Chu Lingxiao; does that bring anything to mind?"

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he faintly perceived some information, and the wary look in his eyes gradually melted away, replaced by growing clarity.

"It seems you have an inkling, but are not certain—then let me show you proof." Chu Lingxiao laughed heartily, then suddenly extended a hand and sent a surge of energy into Yang Kai's body.

Caught unawares, a clinking sound like chains whipping echoed in the chamber.

A golden chain, dazzling in light, appeared strangely in the void and was seized by Chu Lingxiao.

"Locking Demon Chain!" Yang Kai cried out in surprise.

It was the supremely yang and rigid treasure he had acquired beneath Dragon Confinement Ravine in Lingxiao Pavilion; since obtaining it he had used it twice: once to slay a splinter of the soul of Demon General Meng Ge in the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, and the second time underground in Zhongdu, using the Locking Demon Chain against the Evil Lord Yang Bai.

After Yang Bai's death he had retracted the Locking Demon Chain.

Yet now the Locking Demon Chain was casually summoned out by the Patriarch of Tianxiao Sect.

"This is my possession!" Chu Lingxiao beamed at Yang Kai.

Suddenly the fog in Yang Kai's mind dissipated and everything became clear at once.

He scratched his head with a laugh, "Patriarch?"

Chu Lingxiao nodded slightly. "I did not expect that after hundreds of years someone could travel from that world to the Tongxuan Continent. It seems you've suffered much—thank you for your hardships."

"I haven't suffered that much; many people have helped me along the way." Yang Kai felt a subtle excitement at heart; looking at Chu Lingxiao he felt an inexplicable warmth, a sense of coming home.

"That is for the best." Chu Lingxiao sighed faintly. "A few hundred years ago I went to your side as well; I know resources are scarce over there. That you have come this far is truly surprising."

"So Lingxiao Pavilion really was founded by you?" Yang Kai's eyes lit up.

"Yes." Chu Lingxiao nodded. "I named the sect after myself. Back then I chased a demon general through a Void Passage and arrived in your world; I fought him there and shattered his soul, but his physical body I could not destroy, so I had to bind it with the Locking Demon Chain and seal it beneath that ravine. I established Lingxiao Pavilion simply so someone would guard that demon general's body. After staying there for decades and confirming the demon general's soul had dissipated, I found my way home and returned." Chu Lingxiao explained, then sighed, "Time passes quickly. Are you a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion?"

"I am."

"Good. It matters little either way; the fact you obtained the Locking Demon Chain means there is some fate between us." Chu Lingxiao chuckled, paused, then asked, "And what of matters over there now? Is everything within the sect well?"

"It's not bad now, but a few years ago we nearly suffered annihilation."

"Oh? Tell me about it—I've been somewhat irresponsible regarding the sect I founded."

Yang Kai then recounted in detail the events that had befallen Lingxiao Pavilion over the years; he had not opened his heart like this in a long time. Before him the old man looked kindly and benevolent; as the Patriarch of Tianxiao Sect and the founder of Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai held nothing back.

Chu Lingxiao listened with great interest and seemed genuinely concerned for Yang Kai, who hailed from another world.
