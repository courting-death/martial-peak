## Chapter 1104 — Can I Live Here Too?

The flow of Spiritual Qi throughout heaven and earth seemed to have undergone a subtle change; the dozens of li of territory encircled by six peaks around the cave were slowly emitting an invisible attraction, drawing the surrounding Spiritual Qi toward this place.

It was not violent, but it was continuous and unceasing.

Yu Feng's face changed and he barked, "Is the formation you set up a spirit formation?"

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

"Amazing—able to set up a spirit formation without Saint Crystals?" Yu Feng cried out, and the other martial artists all looked at the Yang Flame returning from afar with faces full of admiration.

The Haike Family also had several secret places where the Spiritual Qi was dense and reserved for clan disciples to cultivate, but arranging those places cost the Haike Family enormous financial, human, and material resources; a large number of Saint Crystals and other rare materials were needed to maintain them.

But the spirit formation arranged on Dragon Lair Mountain had been put in place with Yu Feng and others participating, and they had not seen Yang Kai and Yang Flame use many materials or any Saint Crystals, which was somewhat baffling.

"The terrain here is good; if the terrain were bad you couldn't set it up," Yang Kai explained casually, "and besides, how well it works will have to be tested over time."

Yang Kai truly did not know how effective the newly set formation would be; perhaps it would be only passable, but this place was merely a place for him to settle—he had not poured much effort into it—so even if the effect was poor he would not be disappointed.

"Time...given enough time this place will become the spot with the densest Spiritual Qi within a thousand-li radius, and as time goes by the Spiritual Qi here will grow ever denser," the returning Yang Flame said confidently about her handiwork. "You martial artists here have poor vision; this stretch of mountains and fields is a formidable Hidden Dragon Terrain, and you don't even know how to make use of it."

"Hidden Dragon Terrain?" Yang Kai asked her in puzzlement.

"A name for special terrain," Yang Flame replied offhand. "Even if I explained it to you you wouldn't understand; you only need to know it's very suitable for arranging a spirit formation. It's called Dragon Lair Mountain?"

Yu Feng nodded at her side.

"Mm, the name wasn't chosen without reason, it's just you haven't met anyone with taste," Yang Flame tilted her small face up, proud to the extreme, as if she alone in the world could recognize value.

Yang Kai and Yu Feng looked at each other; after a while Yang Kai said, "Do you want to tell Wu Yi about this? She said she gave this mountain to me; if she wants to take it back now I wouldn't mind."

"Although I'm not in a position to decide for Miss Wu Yi, I think something Miss Wu Yi gives won't be taken back," Yu Feng grinned. "You can live here with peace of mind; if you need anything, come to the manor to find us. If the Spiritual Qi here really gets rich, I'll live here too, brother, just don't kick people out then."

Yang Kai smiled and agreed, indicating he was always welcome.

Yu Feng and a group of martial artists then grandly returned to the Haike Family.

The formation had been completely set up and Yang Flame's work was finished; as previously agreed, Yang Kai took out one hundred Upper-Level Saint Crystals and handed them to her as payment for her help in setting up the formation.

Yang Flame accepted them without ceremony, counting the Saint Crystals one by one, her face beaming in a silly sort of joy.

Yang Kai shook his head and ignored her, turned into the cave, entered the sole stone chamber, took out the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags, and arranged them nearby according to a set pattern.

The Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags had been obtained from the middle-aged woman at the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch on Rainfall Star; it was a Secret Treasure used specifically to assist cultivation, and its effect was astonishingly good.

The reason Yang Kai wasn't overly concerned about Yang Flame's formation was because of these Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags; if the formation's effect proved limited he could still gather Spiritual Qi through this Secret Treasure, and if the formation worked all the better—a two-pronged approach that would speed the accumulation of Spiritual Qi.

Just after he finished setting up seven small flags of different colors, Yang Flame appeared without a sound. The wide robe enveloped her entire figure as she crouched down, staring fixedly at one of the flags. A strange light flickered in her beautiful eyes, making her look somewhat frightening.

"Why didn't you leave?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"I still have to forge a Spirit-Grade Secret Treasure for that Yu Feng—that was the agreement," Yang Flame replied quickly, then shot a burning look at Yang Kai and hurriedly asked, "An Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure! Where did you get it? You're only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—how do you have such a high-grade Secret Treasure?"

Yang Kai frowned. "Someone gave it to me."

"Want it refined? Want me to help refine these seven small flags? Ah, they have so many impurities—let me refine them and I can increase their effectiveness by at least fifteen percent!" Her gaze grew hotter, with even a hint of madness.

Yang Kai's expression darkened; he finally realized that this woman changed when she saw high-grade Secret Treasures—no matter what kind of Secret Treasure, in her eyes it could be refined and its performance improved. Whether that was true he did not know.

Yang Kai did not know the extent of her skill, so he would not take the risk; the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags were his greatest aid for future cultivation—he would not let her refine them casually.

He quickly shook his head in refusal.

Yang Flame could not help showing disappointment; her small mouth pouted and she muttered unhappily, "You all don't believe in my skill! You won't even try—how will you know how powerful I am?"

She sounded pitiful, as if a burning ardor had been poured out in vain; as she spoke she shot a glance at Yang Kai, seemingly hoping he would change his mind.

“Do you have nowhere to go?” Yang Kai suddenly asked.

"Mm." Yang Flame froze for a moment, easily distracted from the topic.

"If you have nowhere to go, then find a place here and settle down—after all, right now it's just me here."

"I can live here?" Yang Flame was overjoyed.

"One condition—don't bother me without cause," Yang Kai waved his hand.

Yang Flame ran off at once; not long after, Yang Kai felt a familiar power emanating from some part of the cave.

It was a fluctuation of Yang attribute power!

This woman cultivated a Yang attribute method? Yang Kai's eyes showed surprise; it wasn't particularly strange for an artificer or alchemist to cultivate a Yang attribute method, but what was odd was how utterly destitute she was. Any competent artificer or alchemist who sought the shelter of a respectable force would be well cared for and enjoy a bright future, yet this woman was clearly impoverished to the extreme.

She had even agreed to refine Yu Feng's Spirit-Grade Secret Treasure for the paltry reward of fifty Lower-Level Saint Crystals.

He resolved to ask her properly another day—had she offended some taboo and been expelled by a force? If so, sheltering her would be troublesome; it would be better to sever ties early.

Releasing his Divine Sense, Yang Kai soon discovered Yang Flame at a section of the cave, using her power to melt the cave wall—she seemed intent on fashioning a stone chamber.

He paid her no mind and began to check his supplies.

Since entering the Body Tempering Divine Pool and being encased by the blood-red crystal, Yang Kai hadn't had time to inspect his gains; only now did he have a moment of leisure.

One by one he took the Spatial Rings from his bosom; there were three in total, belonging to the deceased Guiche, Luo Yao, and Ganji.

In Guiche's Spatial Ring was an Avian Tree of Lightning attribute; it was a crystal formed from the essence and spirit of the Tenth-Tier demonic beast Thunder Luan after its death, its trunk wrapped in lightning and of extraordinary quality—used to forge Secret Treasures it would undoubtedly produce immensely destructive lightning-type Secret Treasures.

The dozens of crystal-clear, lightning-infused leaves were treasures as well.

Yang Kai looked on with delight and stored the Avian Tree into the Demon God's Secret Codex.

He then took out a piece of purple carapace from Guiche's Spatial Ring—the hard shell of a Ninth-Tier demonic beast, the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion; refining it into a defensive Secret Treasure would be fitting, and he also stored it in the Demon God's Secret Codex.

Item after item he took out and put away, each filling him with excitement.

The spoils of that adventure had, for the most part, ended up in his hands alone.

Except for the large pincer of a Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion that had been assigned to Ji Ping, including the scorpion's tail, various inner cores, and materials from various demonic beasts, everything was now in Yang Kai's possession.

In addition, there were countless medicinal herbs the three had gathered along the way.

They themselves were not very wealthy; some of the Secret Treasures originally kept in the Spatial Rings were low-grade, which Yang Kai had no use for, so he tossed them into the Demon God's Secret Codex without another thought.

The haul was substantial, but those things were temporarily of no use.

Yang Kai suddenly realized that if Yang Flame truly was a competent Origin-Grade artificer, he would indeed have things to ask her to do.

At minimum, the Red-Tail Purple-Armored Scorpion's carapace could be made into a defensive Secret Treasure by her—that was what Yang Kai wanted.

Whether her ability truly measured up still remained to be tested.

A day later Yu Feng returned, took away the Spirit-Grade Secret Treasure he had asked her to forge, and left jubilant.

In the following days, Wu Yi's underlings came in groups of three or five, bringing the materials they'd collected or their Secret Treasures and asking Yang Flame to refine them.

Everyone's expectations were high and each person's requirements were fully met; Yang Flame seemed to have come to her senses and stopped arbitrarily changing the form or grade of martial artists' Secret Treasures—she strictly refined them according to their wishes.

For a time praise poured in!

Nearly everyone in the Haike Family knew that in the cave at Dragon Lair Mountain there lived an artificer; although her fees were a bit high, her technique was excellent—every Secret Treasure forged by her was superb, and her refinements could increase a Secret Treasure's power by at least twenty to thirty percent.

Yang Kai did not mind, because he lived deeper in the cave and those coming to ask Yang Flame to refine their items did not disturb him.

What truly angered Yang Kai was that this woman every day found excuses to come to his place and stare covetously at the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags, repeatedly asking if she could refine them; although each time she was refused, she persisted happily, as if her sincerity would eventually move him.
