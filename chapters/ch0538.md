## Chapter 538 — An Unacceptable Consequence

To have turned Zhongdu upside down and rebel against the Eight Great Families to rebel!

Yang Kai had never imagined this. Although he had no strong sense of belonging to the family and only participated in the Succession War to vindicate the sect's name, he had never rebelled to this extent.

Hearing Yang Zhen’s harsh and stern questioning, he quickly realized something.

“Is this how the family sees me?” Yang Kai fixed his gaze on Yang Zhen and asked in a solemn tone.

Yang Zhen’s face was full of grief and indignation as he shook his head. “Don’t blame the family for thinking poorly of you. Your actions these days made it impossible not to think otherwise. Undeniably, you are indeed a promising seedling, but if a promising seedling grows into a demon, the family will not hesitate to purge it to maintain purity!”

After a moment’s pause, Yang Zhen sighed again. “If it were only the family worrying, it would be more negotiable. At worst, the family’s elder masters could use profound techniques to cleanse the demonic energy within your body, and then there would be nothing to fear. But do you know it’s not just our Yang Family concerned about this?”

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold.

“Let me be direct: after your ascension, the other Seven Great Families all sent envoys to contact the Yang Family. They, too, are deeply worried you might become like that Evil Lord!” Yang Zhen sighed deeply. “The past is a lesson for the future. Your sect is the Lingxiao Pavilion. You practice forbidden arts; your talent is extraordinary. Before this, there was an Evil Lord in the Lingxiao Pavilion. That Evil Lord still roams freely in the Cangyun Evil Land, with divine power and profound techniques unmatched across the world. No one above the Divine Roaming Realm can oppose him. You and that Evil Lord share the same source—your relationship can be considered that of senior uncle and junior disciple.”

“One Evil Lord already has the Eight Great Families somewhat helpless; if a second one appeared…” Yang Zhen shook his head slowly, deep dread filling his expression, and even his gaze toward Yang Kai turned heavy with apprehension. “Connecting all these factors, how could they not worry?”

“Worried I will become a second Evil Lord?” Yang Kai’s face darkened.

“Yes, and your talent may even surpass that Evil Lord. If it comes to that, heh…” Yang Zhen forced a bitter smile, his eyes cloudy with confusion.

If two Evil Lords of that level descended upon Zhongdu, what could the Eight Great Families do to resist?

The other elders present were equally wary and horrified, as if they were already envisioning Zhongdu’s destruction and the earth’s anguished cries.

“Ultimately, this is all your conjecture,” Yang Kai suddenly lost interest in arguing and said coldly.

The Eight Great Families were all rigid and stubborn, having lived high above others for many years, making them convinced they were always right. No matter what he said, he could not change their suspicions and views.

Even if he could sway one or two, it would not affect the grand scheme.

“Precaution is the secret behind the Eight Great Families’ endurance here in Zhongdu,” Yang Zhen seemed candid and sincere, “The Eight Great Families must guard against you!”

“My path I shall walk myself.” A mocking sneer played on Yang Kai’s lips. “Back then, I was born weak, without even the strength to hold a chicken. Unable to cultivate, my father hoped to have me enter the Yang Family’s Transformation Dragon Pool to cleanse my veins and marrow. After years of effort and numerous petitions to the Elder Hall, never was it approved—even with my father’s contributions, the Elder Hall only gave one answer: a wasteful cripple has no right to exploit the pool’s power.”

Yang Zhen’s expression turned awkward—the petitions made by Fourth Master Yang had been dismissed by him. Now with Yang Kai bringing up the matter again, he naturally felt some shame.

“Now, with my achievements and cultivation, the family wants to control me. Elder Zhen, don’t you find this laughable?”

Yang Zhen’s face went ashen and he was at a loss for words.

Yang Kai continued, “A few days ago, when I ascended to the Divine Roaming Realm, were it not for the intervention of some friends and elders, I would have been immediately nullified by the Grand Elder. Even if not dead, I would have been reduced to an ordinary person. To guard against me, the family intends to eradicate me? Elder, don’t you think the family has gone too far?”

“Presumptuous!” Yang Zhen burst out, shamed and enraged. “The family comes first — what does it matter if you sacrifice yourself for it?”

“Your noble ideals are beyond my reach. I am a selfish man.” Yang Kai suddenly took a step forward, his killing intent surging, cold and ruthless. “Since this is the case, I will help you. I shall kill several elders first, then apologize to the Xiang Family and submit to the family’s judgment. In so doing, you will have sacrificed yourselves for the clan.”

Everyone’s faces changed drastically, all rising swiftly, warily and fearfully fixing their gazes on Yang Kai as their strength gathered silently.

Yang Kai laughed loudly. “It seems the elders are rather selfish too…”

Flushing with shame, the elders realized how easy it was to talk but how difficult it would be to truly act.

“Enough of this. Let us speak of serious matters.” A hoarse female voice hastily diverted the topic.

Yang Zhen looked at Yang Kai, shaking his head with a wry smile. “Dealing with you is exhausting. I will be blunt. Asking you to apologize to the two Xiang families was just a ruse. None of the Yang Family’s younger generation have ever bowed to others. Even if you want to, the family will never agree and will try to stop you.”

“Then what does the family truly want from me?”

“Return to Zhongdu. The family’s Grand Elders will join forces to expel the demonic energy from within you. Henceforth, you need not fear falling into Qi Deviation. The family and the Seven Great Families will no longer guard against you.”

Yang Kai remained silent.

He doubted that those Grand Elders could eliminate the evil energy from his Proud Bone Golden Body. The energy was undetectable unless he activated it.

Moreover, it posed no harm to him; Yang Kai saw no necessity in disposing of it.

“You may continue in the Succession War, but the future head of the Yang Family cannot be you. The current head has said that once the Succession War concludes, he will restore the Lingxiao Pavilion’s reputation. He hopes you understand the family’s hard intentions.”

The family’s wariness and suspicion toward Yang Kai meant they would never allow him to inherit the family headship. If he became an Evil Lord-like figure one day, the Yang Family would be utterly disgraced.

“Don’t rush to refuse. The family’s motive has another layer.” Yang Zhen inhaled deeply.

“What motive?”

“It concerns the secret behind the rapid strength increase of those warriors in your residence!” Yang Zhen’s tone dropped; his burning gaze fixed on Yang Kai.

The other elders’ breathing also suddenly hastened.

“Do you think you could hide it? Although no one knows how your followers increase their strength so quickly, it is clear they have a connection to you. Blood Servants Hall members have successively ascended to the ninth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, a phenomenon too abnormal and attracting much attention. Moreover, your parents…”

A cold glint flickered in Yang Kai’s eyes, vanishing as quickly as it appeared.

“Yang Yingfeng has a chronic illness, his strength stayed at the third stage of Divine Roaming Realm for years. But now? He is at the eighth stage! And it all happened since your return to Zhongdu, in less than a year. Do you dare claim you had nothing to do with it? Dong Suzhu’s growth isn’t as terrifying, but it’s still much faster than before. Do you really think we Yang Family elders are blind?”

Yang Kai remained indifferent.

Before giving his parents the Wan Yao Ling Ye and Wan Yao Ling Milk, he had considered this very question but still gave it to them—after all, they were his parents.

“You practice forbidden arts, a fast track to strength; we can understand that. But what means did you use to get your followers and even family to increase strength so rapidly? That’s beyond our comprehension. The Yang Family cares, and the Seven Great Families do as well.” Yang Zhen's expression turned playful. “Otherwise, why would the seven families join forces to pressure us Yang Family to deal with you? You only have the potential to become an Evil Lord; your strength alone isn’t that high. They aren’t so idle as to target you this early.”

The Zhongdu Eight Great Families were shrewd, sensing profit wherever they moved.

The hidden Wan Yao Ling Ye was the bait.

What family would not covet a method to quickly enhance their warriors’ strength?

“Returning to Zhongdu is also for this reason. Only under the protection of your family’s masters can you truly rest easy.”

“The family mainly wants that secret, don’t they?”

“I won’t deny it.” Yang Zhen nodded openly. “But this time the family has done all it can. We came to you; we did not send messengers demanding your return. You should understand the difference.”

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Coming to him, explaining everything openly, clearly meant they wanted cooperation, for him to obediently return to the Yang Family and hand over the secret, bringing blessings to the clan.

If they sent messengers commanding his return to subdue him by force, imprisoning him, there would be no compromise. It would end only in mutual destruction.

The Yang Family knew Yang Kai’s temperament well and thus preferred the first, peaceful way.

“Think it through.” Yang Zhen said no more and waited quietly.

Yang Kai shook his head. “Now that I know all this, there’s no way I’m returning to Zhongdu.”

The family wanting the Wan Yao Ling Ye was acceptable; there were plenty he could produce. Though he lacked strong family ties, the Succession War was still the stage the Yang Family gave him to show his talents. He could give the family some Wan Yao Ling Ye as thanks.

But returning to Zhongdu meant he would never leave again, and his cultivation would certainly be destroyed.

That consequence was one Yang Kai could never accept.
