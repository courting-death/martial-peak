## Chapter 2438 — Chatting Passionately

In Guan Qi’s eyes, Yang Kai was the sort who lived for lust, the kind whose legs would go weak at the sight of a beautiful woman. From the way he was flattering the woman opposite him, he was clearly taken with her looks. That woman was no good either; when he’d met her here earlier, she’d tried to seduce him, hoping he would hand over the Origin, and only after he refused did they fight. Now, she was throwing flirtatious glances at Yang Kai, utterly shameless and without a shred of decency.

Yu Ying smiled and said, “Does this Senior Brother have some connection to my Netherworld Sect?”

Though it sounded like a casual question, it revealed how careful and sharp-minded she was. She knew that in the Shattered Star Sea, no one could be trusted easily — and Yang Kai’s single remark about having long heard of Netherworld Sect was hardly enough to make her believe that this man truly bore her no ill will.

She needed to probe a bit more to be sure the other party truly wouldn’t trouble her. Otherwise, as a mere Second Stage cultivator of the Dao Origin Realm, she really wasn’t his match.

“Of course there’s a connection.” Yang Kai smiled slightly, seeing through Yu Ying’s caution. After a moment’s thought, he said, “I come from the Great Wilderness Star Domain. I wonder if you’ve heard of it!”

Yu Ying’s beautiful eyes lit up at his words, and she exclaimed, “Great Wilderness Star Domain?”

Yang Kai laughed, “Since Junior Sister has heard of the Great Wilderness Star Domain, you must be quite familiar with Senior Brother Yin Lesheng, right?”

That Yin Lesheng was also from the Great Wilderness Star Domain, like Liu Qianyun; both had once been overlords there.

Yang Kai hadn’t expected to run into someone from the Eastern Territory’s Netherworld Sect here in the Shattered Star Sea. Or rather, he’d considered it, but hadn’t thought it would be so easy.

Previously, he’d set out from Thousand Leaves Sect, planning to visit the Eastern Territory’s Netherworld Sect to ask Yin Lesheng about Xiaoxiao’s whereabouts. But life rarely goes as planned—he hadn’t even reached the Eastern Territory before being swept into the Jixu Secret Realm, then sent to the Northern Territory, ruining his plans.

Upon suddenly encountering someone from the Netherworld Sect, Yang Kai was naturally delighted.

He didn’t know if Yin Lesheng had come to the Shattered Star Sea. If he was here, Yang Kai figured he could ask Yu Ying about Yin Lesheng’s whereabouts.

If he wanted to find Xiaoxiao, he’d have to start with Yin Lesheng.

For a moment, Yang Kai’s gaze toward Yu Ying changed, filled with fiery intent.

Yu Ying clearly noticed, and at just the right moment, she showed a hint of shyness, softly saying, “Senior Brother Yin treats me very well.”

“Senior Brother?” Yang Kai raised his brows, surprised.

Yin Lesheng had only come to the Star Realm from the Great Wilderness Star Domain six or seven years ago. Even if he’d joined the Eastern Territory’s Netherworld Sect, he shouldn’t have become someone’s Senior Brother so quickly.

This Yu Ying was at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and she called Yin Lesheng Senior Brother. Didn’t that mean Yin Lesheng’s cultivation was higher than hers?

“Of course he’s Senior Brother!” Yu Ying smiled, “Though Senior Brother Yin hasn’t been in our sect long, his talent is outstanding. The Sect Master personally accepted him as a disciple, and just before the Shattered Star Sea opened, he advanced to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm!”

Yang Kai inhaled sharply at her words.

Yin Lesheng had actually advanced to the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm? In such a short time? Yang Kai had thought his own cultivation speed was fast, but Yin Lesheng was no slouch—he’d progressed just as quickly.

Compared to Ai Ou and Chi Yue’s current cultivation, Yin Lesheng’s progress was downright terrifying.

Yu Ying smiled and said, “Senior Brother Yin is not only a Star Lord who ascended from a lower Star Domain, but was also personally accepted as a disciple by our Sect Master, granting him access to vast cultivation resources. Even so, for him to reach the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm in such a short time is nothing short of miraculous. When he first joined our sect, I was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm myself, but now… hehe.”

As she spoke, her expression dimmed slightly, as if she felt inferior compared to Yin Lesheng’s progress.

“Senior Brother Yin is truly exceptional, the person I admire most in my life. Now that I know he’s reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, it’s wonderful news!” Yang Kai forced himself to flatter, suppressing his disgust.

Yu Ying seemed to let go of her doubts and wariness. After all, anyone who could mention the Great Wilderness Star Domain and Yin Lesheng clearly had a close connection to him—otherwise, they wouldn’t know such secrets.

“Isn’t Senior Brother also at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm? Junior Sister thinks you’re no worse than Senior Brother Yin.” Yu Ying smiled.

“I wouldn’t dare compare myself to Senior Brother Yin. I only reached this point thanks to a rare opportunity. If I’d cultivated step by step, I’d never match his heaven-defying talent. Back in the Great Wilderness Star Domain, I received much guidance and favor from him. I even came to the Star Realm with him, planning to join your sect together. But the Starlight Passage collapsed, and I was sent to the Southern Territory, so I never got to see your sect’s grandeur.”

“You were going to join our sect?” Yu Ying looked at Yang Kai in surprise. “Why haven’t I heard Senior Brother Yin mention this?”

From her tone, she really did seem very familiar with Yin Lesheng.

Yang Kai smiled, “Senior Brother Yin probably thought I was dead. I was badly injured at the time, but later, misfortune turned to blessing—not only did I survive, I gained a great opportunity.”

“So that’s how it was!” Yu Ying nodded, not doubting him.

Yang Kai changed the subject, “By the way, is Senior Brother Yin also in the Shattered Star Sea now?”

"He is. Our sect sent twelve people this time, and Senior Brother Yin naturally has a place." Yu Ying replied.

“That’s great.” Yang Kai said excitedly, “All these years I’ve wanted to go to the Eastern Territory to find Senior Brother Yin, but the journey was too long. Who would’ve thought I’d run into Junior Sister here in the Shattered Star Sea? Isn’t this fate!”

Yu Ying giggled, “It’s Junior Sister’s good fortune to meet Senior Brother here. By the way, I still don’t know how to address Senior Brother!”

“Feng De, my name is Feng De!” Yang Kai replied.

Feng De was a real person—a bald, burly man who, back in the Starlight Passage, had followed Yin Lesheng like Liu Qianyun did. But Yang Kai had killed him later. Now, pretending to be from the Great Wilderness Star Domain, he had borrowed Feng De’s name.

Who knew what expression Yin Lesheng would have if he heard Feng De had come back from the dead?

“Greetings, Senior Brother Feng!” After chatting with Yang Kai, Yu Ying was no longer so cautious and instead became quite friendly. Her eyes twinkled as she asked, “Does Senior Brother Feng still want to join our sect, or do you already have a sect?”

Yang Kai said, "What sect? I did join a small sect once, but it was wiped out, so I’ve been on my own ever since." As he spoke, he looked at Yu Ying expectantly, "I’d love to join your sect, but first, I haven’t seen Senior Brother Yin, and second, I have no one to introduce me, so I didn’t dare be presumptuous."

Yu Ying smiled, “That’s easy. Once things are settled here, I’ll take you to find Senior Brother Yin. You can talk to him yourself—I’m sure he won’t refuse you.”

“Really?” Yang Kai asked joyfully.

“Why would Junior Sister lie to you?” Yu Ying smiled, her body leaning a little closer to Yang Kai, bringing a rich fragrance with her. With deep meaning, she said, “If Senior Brother Feng joins our sect, you must take good care of your little sister.”

Yang Kai immediately put on a lovestruck look, nodding repeatedly, “If I can really join your sect, then Junior Sister Yu will be my great benefactor. I’d never treat you as an outsider.”

Yu Ying giggled, “Then I’ll thank Senior Brother Feng in advance.”

The two chatted passionately, while Guan Qi’s face grew extremely dark.

When Yang Kai claimed to be from the Great Wilderness Star Domain, Guan Qi already sensed trouble. As the pair grew more and more animated, looking like a pair of lovebirds, his sense of crisis deepened.

Now, with the two calling each other fellow disciples, it was clear they were becoming a team. Guan Qi was both anxious and flustered.

He wasn’t sure he could beat Yu Ying alone, and with Yang Kai added, he had no chance. Besides, Yang Kai didn’t seem to like Wenqing Sect much, so as a Wenqing Sect disciple, what advantage could he hope for?

He wanted to escape, but didn’t dare to move rashly, afraid of provoking their killing intent.

But if he didn’t leave now, what could he do?

Thinking this, he gritted his teeth, cupped his fists, and said, “You two carry on, I’ll take my leave.”

As he spoke, his figure flickered, ready to retreat.

Just as Yu Ying was smiling and talking to Yang Kai, her face suddenly turned cold—her expression changed in an instant—and she shrieked, “Where do you think you’re going!”

As she spoke, she raised her delicate hand, and a sinister ghost claw shot toward Guan Qi, radiating an evil, bone-chilling aura.

Guan Qi’s face changed, and he raised his hand, sending countless fist shadows soaring.

With a thunderous crash, the two exchanged a single blow, ending in a draw.

But with Yu Ying blocking him, Guan Qi couldn’t leave even if he wanted to.

“Senior Brother Feng…” Yu Ying suddenly called out to Yang Kai in a sweet, coquettish voice, shaking his arm and stamping her foot, “This man bullied me, aren’t you going to do something?”

Yang Kai got goosebumps all over, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead. Suppressing his disgust, he snorted, “Kid, you dare bully Junior Sister Yu? You really have a death wish.”

He didn’t much like Wenqing Sect people, but he had no grudge against Guan Qi, so there was no reason to kill him on sight. Besides, he didn’t like being used as a weapon. Yu Ying was clearly trying to use him against Guan Qi, which made Yang Kai uncomfortable. So, though he acted fierce, he showed no killing intent.

Guan Qi gritted his teeth, “Brother Feng, I found this Origin first, but this lady tried to snatch it, and we fought. She’s not hurt, so I’ll give up the Origin and just want to leave. Please let me go.”
