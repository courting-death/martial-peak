## Chapter 1003 — Unappreciative

On the Floating Continent, the old man departed with unhurried grace, leaving the people of Purple Star and Sword Alliance standing frozen in place, at a complete loss for what to do.

The members of the Sword Alliance in particular looked like they had lost their parents, every face filled with grief and rage; Yue Xi's pretty features twisted, her beautiful eyes fixed on the direction the old man had taken, angry yet unable to speak.

Lü Guichen glanced at her and laughed heartily. “Well, isn’t that perfect? We’ve been fighting over it all this time, only to sew wedding clothes for someone else—what a waste of effort.”

“How dare you say that!” Yue Xi snapped, whirling to glare at him, her silver teeth clenched. “If your Purple Star people hadn’t chased after my two disciples, they would have returned to Sword Star with the Star Gate Token long ago. They wouldn’t have broken into the Chaos Abyss; we wouldn’t be stranded here and forced to grovel to others. This whole mess is your fault!”

Lü Guichen’s expression chilled. “That’s not quite right. Those two of yours found the Star Gate Token on a territory that belongs to my Purple Star. Strictly speaking, that token is Purple Star property. I haven’t accused you of theft—yet you turn it back on us?”

“Lü Guichen, you remember this—if one day I get away from here, I’ll make sure you never see redemption!” Yue Xi hissed, blaming Purple Star for the calamity of the Star Gate Token being snatched away.

“Let’s see you get out of here first.” Lü Guichen sneered, ignoring her threats, and waved to his Purple Star warriors, “Come over here and inventory what’s in this pile. See how much belongs to us; don’t let anyone pilfer our things.”

Dozens of Purple Star fighters surged toward the heap of supplies piled like a small hill.

Yue Xi’s delicate frame trembled, and the Sword Alliance began their own counting as well.

Over a hundred people swarmed together to search for what belonged to them.

“The Star Gate Token. It’s the Star Gate Token! My heavens, it’s really the Star Gate Token!” Shen Tu kept shouting, his face wild with fanatic enthusiasm, as though he could hardly contain himself.

From the moment that old man took the Star Gate Token, Shen Tu had been excited, and he still hadn’t calmed down.

Yang Kai said nothing as he sat beside him, waiting until Shen Tu’s chatter subsided before asking, “What is that thing? Why does everyone seem to want it?”

“Of course they want it!” Shen Tu answered in a low, fierce voice. “That’s the Star Gate Token! When the Star Gate Token appears, the entire Star Domain bows before it. It’s a weapon of immense power—if I could get my hands on that thing…”

He muttered, his eyes gleaming like a famished wolf hunting in snow, fantasizing about the wonders that would follow if he possessed the Star Gate Token.

“I see. No wonder Purple Star risked venturing into the Chaos Abyss to pursue the Sword Alliance—it's all for the Star Gate Token. Ha. That explains it; one Star Gate Token is enough to lure them into danger.” Shen Tu mused. “What a pity it ended up in the hands of that old freak. Once he gets hold of it, it’s likely impossible to retrieve.”

He sighed as if lamenting a cherished loss, acting as though the Star Gate Token had been rightfully his.

Yang Kai was about to press him for more information about the Star Gate Token when he noticed Yue Xi rapidly approaching. He frowned, alert.

Yang Kai didn’t fully trust the woman.

Perhaps it was the humiliation she had just endured, but Yue Xi’s face looked dark and sullen.

She came straight to Yang Kai, pursed her ruby lips, and hesitated as if wanting to speak.

“Something wrong?” Yang Kai asked with a frown.

“Can you return the Spatial Ring you gave me?” Yue Xi asked awkwardly. “You saw what happened—our elder took all our Spatial Rings, and without a Secret Treasure to store our goods it’s very inconvenient.”

Her manner toward Yang Kai yesterday had not been kind, and now asking for the return of what she had sent out made her look uneasy.

If not for necessity, she wouldn’t have humbled herself like this.

After speaking, she watched Yang Kai quietly, waiting for his reply.

“If I remember correctly, that ring was given to me yesterday, so it’s mine now,” Yang Kai said with an odd expression.

“Yes.” Yue Xi bowed her head. “But we need it back now. Don’t worry—once we leave here I’ll give you more reward. I’ll make it worth your while. How about that?”

“I can’t refuse, can I?” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

“You can refuse,” Yue Xi replied coldly. “And while we’re still here, if you refuse, I won’t do anything to you.”

“So that means once we leave, what will you do to me?” Yang Kai tested the implication behind her words.

Yue Xi neither confirmed nor denied, only said, “I can lift the restriction on your body now, restore your power, and make it easier for you to act.”

“No need.” Yang Kai shook his head. After yesterday’s events he would never allow Yue Xi to manipulate his strength again.

With that, he moved his mind and poured out a thousand Saint Crystals from the ring, removed the ring from his finger, and tossed it to Yue Xi. “I’m just telling you this: the restoratives I gave He Miao weren’t for your reward. But I’ll keep these thousand Saint Crystals. We’re square—no debts between us.”

Yue Xi caught the ring in her hand, her expression turning slightly odd. She seemed somewhat uneasy as she softly parted her red lips and said, “Without my help, no one here could possibly undo the restriction Lü Guichen placed on you.”

“No need to trouble yourself.”

Yue Xi’s pretty face shifted; she snorted coldly, “Ungrateful!”

She hadn’t expected Yang Kai to refuse her kindly offered help. In her view, the youth should be grateful—after all, on this unknown continent no one wants to be unable to use their power.

Her irritation turned to humiliation; she felt she had presented warmth only to be met with a cold shoulder.

Before, given her status and position, she would never have deigned to speak with a junior like Yang Kai.

But now, fallen and in distress, she had to lower herself.

No longer willing to waste words, she turned away with the Spatial Ring and left.

“Brother, do you have a grudge with that woman?” After Yue Xi left, Shen Tu quietly asked, “How did you manage to offend her?”

“I didn’t offend her; she’s just overly suspicious,” Yang Kai replied, shaking his head, unconcerned.

“Still, she wasn’t wrong. Without her help, you won’t be able to lift Lü Guichen’s restriction. Even if I recover, there’s nothing I can do about it,” Shen Tu said helplessly.

“I’ll find my own way.”

“Forget it, let’s not talk about that anymore—it’s just upsetting. What about these thousand Crystal Stones? Leaving them here like this doesn’t seem right, does it?”

“I have something.” Yang Kai said, and produced several delicate little pouches, tossing two to Shen Tu and taking one himself as he began putting Saint Crystals into them.

The fist-sized, translucent Saint Crystals slipped into the pouches as if swallowed, vanishing from sight. Shen Tu gaped. “What is that? It actually has storage function?”

“Spatial Pouches. A storage Secret Treasure used on our continent.” Yang Kai explained casually. These Spatial Pouches were spoils or gains from previous ventures, kept in his Demon God's Secret Codex and seldom used—this time they proved useful.

That mysterious old man had an eye on the Ethereal Crystal. Yang Kai didn’t want to reveal the secrets of his Demon God's Secret Codex—if he slipped up, that codex might be taken from him.

For now, he could only use the Spatial Pouches to conceal things.

Shen Tu clicked his tongue in admiration and mimicked Yang Kai, stuffing Saint Crystals into the Spatial Pouches, laughing, “Not bad—your lower-grade continent actually developed such a Secret Treasure. It’s got value; only the space is a little small.”

He seemed quite interested in the Spatial Pouches. After stuffing both full, he tucked them into his robes and said brashly, “These Crystal Stones are mine for now—I’ll pay you back later.”

“Fine.” Yang Kai nodded indifferently.

Purple Star and Sword Alliance fighters continued to sort and divide the mountain of supplies, while Shen Tu took Saint Crystals from his Spatial Pouch and began to restore himself.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged beside him and tried to draw on his inner power, but his meridians were bound and blocked; his strength could not circulate, leaving him frustrated.

With no other choice, he sank into meditation, sending his spirit body into the Sea of Consciousness.

He planned to devour those soul-energies first.

Dozens of soul-essences, large and small, hovered over the Sea of Consciousness—these were the spirits of warriors who had died near Yang Kai during the recent catastrophe.

Most were from the Saint Realm, and one was the soul-essence of an expert from the Saint King Realm.

Yang Kai watched for a while, then eagerly gathered them to begin invoking the power of the World-Ending Demon Eye.

A dazzling golden light shone forth—the Soul-Extinguishing Golden Light that could scatter any spirit—an art cultivated by the Great Demon God.

A sizzling sound rang out as those soul-essences seemed thrown into boiling water, and black, mistlike remnants emerged and were purified clean.

These were the memories and life’s experiences of the deceased.

Yang Kai could not and would not absorb them; doing so might scramble his mind and cause him to forget who he was.

In the blink of an eye, the dozens of soul-essences were mostly purified away, leaving behind only each warrior’s unique insights into the Dao of martial arts.

One of the essences was somewhat different; under the World-Ending Demon Eye’s golden light it resisted longer before being cleansed.

It was the soul-essence of the Saint King Realm expert.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but be moved.

Examining it closely, he found the nourishment contained within far richer than that of the others, which thrilled him.

He wasted no time and began to devour and refine it, absorbing the pure soul-energy into his Sea of Consciousness, assimilating it into his own strength.

Time passed, and before long Yang Kai had almost finished refining the dozens of essences.

He discovered something troubling.

These warriors’ insights into the Dao and combat were far deeper and purer than those of Tongxuan Continent’s fighters; their understanding of power and laws was incomparable.

That meant their combat ability outclassed Tongxuan Continent warriors of the same tier, because their mastery of power was deeper.
