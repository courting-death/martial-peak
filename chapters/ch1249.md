## Chapter 1249 — Second Star Emperor Token

When he lifted his head again, he was startled to find, above the incense burner on the altar, a portrait of a figure — but only a back view. It was clearly the silhouette of a woman: tall and slender, exquisitely formed, clad in a pristine white gown like a goddess, radiating an aura of chilling untouchability.

Yang Kai only glanced once and felt his heart suddenly lurch; an inexplicable urge to prostrate himself surged up, and flustered, he immediately circulated his cultivation technique to suppress the stirring thought.

Upon a closer look, Yang Kai frowned.

He realized that the woman's back in the painting looked faintly familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere before.

Moreover, once he dispelled that impulse to worship, the scroll seemed to flatten into ordinariness again — just a commonplace portrait, nothing remarkable.

Shaking his head inwardly, Yang Kai used his Divine Sense to inspect the scroll carefully; after confirming there was nothing hidden within it, he withdrew his gaze.

It was certain: the woman in the painting was either the owner of this pavilion or had a deep connection to its owner; otherwise her portrait would not have been placed here.

He had no intention of taking the scroll. Having already harvested a Ten-Thousand-Year Incense, he was content; there was no need to prey upon someone else's portrait.

He searched the surroundings again, but found nothing else.

On the pavilion's first level, aside from the incense burning in the censer, there seemed to be nothing but that ordinary scroll — nothing more.

There was a flight of stairs leading to the second level beside it. Yang Kai strode forward and ascended along the steps.

After rounding a corner, he easily arrived at the second level.

What met his eyes left Yang Kai stunned.

The second floor of this pavilion was, astonishingly, a woman's boudoir. Though the room held few items, Yang Kai could still deduce from the furnishings that this was indeed a woman's dwelling.

A bed, a table, a chair; a meditation cushion lay on the bed, and there was nothing else — the arrangement was extremely simple.

Scanning the table and chair, Yang Kai quickly fixed his attention on the meditation cushion; the pavilion's owner clearly used it for cultivation, so the cushion in use should not be a mundane object.

Thinking this, Yang Kai stepped forward and reached out to pick up the cushion.

To his surprise, the instant his fingers touched the cushion, it crumbled into a pile of dust.

It turned out to be an ordinary cushion, unable to withstand the ravages of time — long gone beyond use. Seeing this, Yang Kai was momentarily taken aback, then could only give a wry laugh. It seemed his streak of gains had been followed by a pinch of greed; he had almost even tried to take someone's meditation cushion, and the heavens had punished him.

After searching the second level a while longer and confirming there truly was nothing valuable here, Yang Kai turned and walked toward the stairs leading to the third level.

This trip into the Flowing Flame Sandland had already been bountiful. After the cushion incident his temper instantly calmed; even if the third level yielded nothing, he would not be overly concerned.

With that in mind, he quickly climbed the stairs and arrived at the third level of the pavilion.

To his surprise, there really was something on this third level.

Floating boldly in midair was a token!

A glance at the token sent a jolt through Yang Kai, and he hurriedly rummaged through his Black Book Space.

A moment later, another token appeared in his hand. It was almost identical to the one floating before him—made of a material neither metal nor wood, without any markings, except for a single large “Emperor” character engraved in the center.

From that token emanated a crushing aura of authority, so overwhelming it stirred instinctive fear in the heart—compelling one to kneel and bow in reverence.

"Star Emperor Token!" Yang Kai's expression hardened as he recognized it at once.

The Star Emperor Token was said to have been crafted by the Starry Sky Emperor. The Ghost Ancestor had once told Yang Kai that there were ten such tokens in total, though their whereabouts were unknown. Each token sealed within it one of the Starry Sky Emperor's divine arts, and by using that art one could easily slay a Void King Realm expert.

The Star Emperor Token in his hand had been given to him by the Ghost Ancestor. After Yang Kai had helped the Ghost Ancestor escape his two-thousand-year imprisonment when they left the Floating Continent together, the Ghost Ancestor — spiteful and lawless though he was — had for some reason gifted this token to Yang Kai at the end.

It was likely a repayment for saving his life.

He had been told that in moments of extreme peril he could pour Saint Yuan into the token to unleash the star-emperor art sealed within.

Of course, even employing the Star Emperor's art to slay a powerful enemy would leave little chance of Yang Kai surviving; the sealed art's power was so great it could drain his entire being.

Ever since receiving that token, Yang Kai had kept it hidden in his Black Book Space, never once thinking to use it.

First, because using it was far too dangerous; second, because he had never faced a calamity he couldn't resolve without it.

He never imagined that on the Sixth Layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland he would find a second Star Emperor Token within a pavilion!

But Yang Kai soon sensed something amiss: the token hovering before him looked different from the one in his hand — its internal Spiritual Qi seemed severely depleted. Though its majesty remained, it carried none of the sense of lethal threat.

Someone had used the divine art sealed within this Star Emperor Token! In other words, there was no longer a star-emperor killing technique sealed inside.

Yang Kai mused inwardly, yet he was surprised the token had not been destroyed after use.

Regardless, with such a token before him, Yang Kai was unwilling to let it go. As he reached out to take it, a layer of radiance suddenly rippled from the token.

Yang Kai's face changed. Sensing the murderous energy within the radiance, his Saint Yuan burst forth and he vaulted backward; but though he moved quickly, the radiance spread faster and swept across his body in an instant.

Yang Kai turned ashen; even a used Star Emperor Token was not something one could casually violate.

Just when he thought he was doomed, the token in his hand — the intact one — also emitted a shimmer. When the two layers of radiance touched, they both vanished.

The second Star Emperor Token, which had been suspended in midair on the pavilion's Third Stage, suddenly lost its levitation and fell to the floor with a light clatter, bouncing a few times before coming to rest.

Yang Kai, still shaken, gripped his token tightly as cold sweat broke out on his brow.

He had not expected such a turn. Were it not for his chance possession of a Star Emperor Token, that radiance would have left him grievously injured; the strange power it released was far beyond what he could withstand now.

After a moment to catch his breath, Yang Kai slowly stepped forward.

At that moment the world trembled. Yang Kai suddenly felt a strange shifting of the surrounding space, and vaguely perceived a repulsive force emanating from all directions, as if intent on expelling him.

Simultaneously, the shadow of a slender jade hand reached down from the heights, aiming to seize Yang Kai.

The delicate hand was clearly a woman's, yet it was astonishingly large, nearly blotting out the pavilion's entire sky. Ignoring the building's structure, it descended directly toward Yang Kai's head.

Yang Kai's expression darkened; in a flash he understood — the Flowing Flame Sandland was closing, and thus the surrounding spatial forces had become turbulent.

He guessed correctly that this scene must be occurring throughout the Flowing Flame Sandland; the warriors who had entered here to train would all be flung out by that slender hand.

His guess proved true. Shadows of slender jade hands reached from the void across the levels one through four of the Flowing Flame Sandland, easily snatching up those resting or fighting. The hands then transformed into beams of light and vanished, taking the warriors' figures with them.

Moments later, on the periphery of the Flowing Flame Sandland, strange silhouettes materialized, and the elders of the great Sects who had stood waiting outside rejoiced and surged forward.

But in the pavilion Yang Kai fiercely condensed Saint Yuan and struck out a palm toward the shadow of the hand.

His Heaven-Covering Palm failed utterly to stop the jade hand. Yang Kai lunged forward and rolled on the ground; a dozen Space Blades shot forth from the spot, slowing the hand's advance for an instant.

Seizing that precious moment, Yang Kai snatched the Star Emperor Token from the floor, then stood still and relaxed, deciding not to resist further.

Yet just as the hand closed on him and the spatial force began to warp to cast him out, the two Star Emperor Tokens in his possession shone simultaneously, forming a pale-blue shield that enveloped him.

The hand disappeared, and Yang Kai still stood on the pavilion's Third Stage, bewildered.

Soon the distorted spatial forces dissipated, and the sense of repulsion vanished as well.

Yang Kai seemed to have been forgotten, left standing there all alone.

After a long while he finally reacted, struck by both shock and joy.

He could confirm that the Flowing Flame Sandland had indeed closed and that the transport force had been applied to him, but it had been inexplicably blocked by the two Star Emperor Tokens — in short, he had been left behind.

What pleased him was that he now had ample time to make use of; what worried him was that, once he went out, he had no idea what dangers might await.

After all, while the Flowing Flame Sandland was open the perils of the Heat-Flame Zone were greatly reduced, but once it closed the dangers within could multiply; to leave he would have to pass through all six layers to reach the outside.

Thinking about it now was futile; by some twist of fate he had been left behind, and it was wiser to consider how to take advantage of the situation.

He dared not pocket the two Star Emperor Tokens — who knew what might happen if he withdrew them? He could only keep them close at hand.
