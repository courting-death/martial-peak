## Chapter 1686 — Submission and Joining

So after a brief silence, a man stepped forward to Yang Kai; he looked to be around forty or fifty years old. Approaching, he clasped his fists with a solemn expression and said, "I am Wang Taizhen, Sect Master of Jidao Sect, I wish to submit to Lingxiao Sect and henceforth obey Sect Master Yang's orders!"

"We of the Wei Huo Alliance will look only to Sect Master Yang; we will follow you to mountains of blades and seas of fire without hesitation."

"Wuji Pavilion is willing..."

"..."

Immediately a dozen or so Sects declared their stance, coming forward one after another to salute Yang Kai.

Yang Kai stood where he was, his manner neither cold nor warm, appearing somewhat deep and unfathomable.

As time passed, more and more forces submitted.

In the face of absolute strength, if they still refused to see the reality then they were courting death! These people had only barely managed to flee into Lingxiao Sect to take refuge — who among them would willingly die now?

Yang Kai's methods were a touch overbearing and his manner made people uncomfortable, but at least they could live.

A beautiful woman stepped before Yang Kai and, eyes flickering with sincerity, pleaded, "Liuli Sect is willing to join Lingxiao Sect; from now on Dark Star will have no Liuli Sect — I beg Sect Master Yang to be magnanimous and take us in!"

When she said that, the experts who had earlier pledged fealty were visibly moved, all looking at the speaker with looks of disbelief.

Yang Kai regarded her with interest and discovered to his surprise that he actually knew her.

She was Gong Aofu, the current Sect Master of Liuli Sect.

Strictly speaking, she could be considered Daiyuan's master, but for particular reasons Daiyuan was not favored by Gong Aofu. Instead, Yin Sudie received Gong Aofu's favor and was kept constantly at her side, cultivated vigorously.

At that moment the coquettishly adorned Yin Sudie stood beside Gong Aofu, even daringly batting a few alluring glances at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's mouth curved in a smile as he looked at Gong Aofu with deep meaning and slowly said, "Sect Master Gong, do you know what you are saying?"

Gong Aofu pursed her lips and smiled, smoothing the long black hair by her ear, and replied calmly, "I am no child; of course I know. Sect Master Yang need not worry — I will be responsible for my words."

Submission and joining are entirely different matters. Those Sects who had declared submission to Yang Kai would obey his commands, but they were not part of Lingxiao Sect — they would retain their own Sect names and positions and might one day return to their Sect's main headquarters.

But Gong Aofu's wish to join was different. To join Lingxiao Sect, Liuli Sect would have to be dissolved; in other words, Liuli Sect would end with her generation if Yang Kai accepted them. From then on, they would be disciples of Lingxiao Sect.

Yang Kai would take full control of their fates. Without his permission they could never leave Lingxiao Sect, could not revive Liuli Sect, and any unauthorized departure would be betrayal of the Sect — an error no one could tolerate.

This was an exceptionally bold decision. After the initial shock, the Origin Returning Realm experts on the square all changed expression, and before long most wore looks of admiration.

They naturally understood what Gong Aofu had in mind. With Yang Kai's forceful return and astonishing combat power, and with Lingxiao Sect now the only truly safe place on Dark Star, joining Lingxiao Sect at this time was undoubtedly the correct choice and would bring far greater protection.

Knowing that was one thing, but for most people to truly give up their own Sect and join Lingxiao Sect — few would willingly do that.

Warriors have always regarded their inheritance as sacred! Each bore the imprint of their Sect — a legacy of honor stretching centuries or millennia, a source of pride and identity.

Even Yang Kai was no exception.

That was why the force he founded on Dark Star was named the Lingxiao Sect, rather than the Nine Heavens Sacred Land or the Tianxiao Sect. Though he was deeply connected with the latter two sects—and had even served as the Master of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

But no matter what, the Lingxiao Pavilion was his true sect. Toward it, he held a special bond—one that neither the Nine Heavens Sacred Land nor the Tianxiao Sect could ever replace.

That Gong Aofu would dissolve Liuli Sect and join Lingxiao Sect showed she could see farther and clearer than most present, and that her character was resolute. Otherwise, she would never make a decision that disgraced her ancestors' honor.

Yang Kai looked straight at her, his gaze profound as if he meant to see into the depths of her heart.

Gong Aofu showed no sign of evasion or guilt; she met Yang Kai's gaze with clear eyes.

“Does Sect Master Yang perhaps find my Liuli Sect too weak and lacking in strength?”

Seeing that Yang Kai had not replied for some time, Gong Aofu could not help but feel uneasy. "Liuli Sect suffered terribly and there are indeed few left. Only fifty came with me into Lingxiao Sect, but of those fifty ten are in the Origin Returning Realm, and the others are all Saint King Realm or above."

“To have even fifty people make it here alive is already quite an accomplishment,” Yang Kai remarked casually, still without giving a clear response.

Gong Aofu felt a touch embarrassed. "I know there may have been unpleasantness between Liuli Sect and Sect Master Yang before, but if Sect Master Yang will accept us, I shall serve to the death with complete sincerity!"

For a woman to speak like that showed she had made a tremendous resolution; even an ordinary man could not issue such grand vows.

As she finished speaking, Gong Aofu gave a sharp command, “Sudie, kneel and apologize to Sect Master Yang! I know you’ve done some things in the past that angered him.”

At Gong Aofu's words Yin Sudie trembled and looked at Yang Kai with pitiful eyes. She did not defy Gong Aofu; right there in public she knelt, her voice soft and weak: "Sudie was foolish before and offended Sect Master Yang. I beg Sect Master Yang to be magnanimous and not hold it against me."

She was now a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert; without Gong Aofu's order she would never have done such a thing to humiliate herself.

If word of it spread, she would have no face to show anyone again.

"Sect Master Yang, please see..." Gong Aofu looked at Yang Kai with hopeful eyes.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment, narrowed his eyes, and turned to Gong Aofu: "I want to know where Daiyuan went. Sect Master Gong, are you aware of her whereabouts?"

Daiyuan was certainly one of the few friends Yang Kai had on Dark Star. Though their acquaintance was not extremely deep, it was not shallow either. Ever since Yang Kai reappeared, he had not seen any sign of Daiyuan; logically, if Daiyuan had escaped into Lingxiao Sect she would have shown herself.

Yang Kai had not found her, and that made him somewhat vexed — he wondered whether something had happened to Daiyuan.

Hearing the question, Gong Aofu strangely relaxed and smiled: "If Sect Master Yang worries about the safety of my disciple, I can assure you there is no need to worry."

"How so?"

"Daiyuan followed Great Elder Ye and retreated into the deepest reaches of the Flowing Flame Sandland, so she is very safe now."

Yang Kai's expression shifted; he felt a certain emotion.

That Daiyuan would follow Ye Xijun into the deepest part of the Flowing Flame Sandland — Yang Kai could hazard a guess at the reason.

Presumably she did not wish to dirty herself with the people in the square, so she resolutely left the Sect and sided with Ye Xijun; there must have been her own reasons for doing so.

If not for her personal friendship with Daiyuan, she likely would never have gone so far as to commit what could be considered an act of betrayal against her Sect.

Yang Kai felt somewhat touched.

He had few friends on Dark Star, but each was worth deep friendship. Wei Guchang and Xuan'er need no explanation — for the sake of rescuing Fei Zhi Tu they were willing to throw themselves into the net, caring nothing for their own lives; Daiyuan's actions were almost tantamount to betraying her Sect.

"Does my answer satisfy Sect Master Yang?" Gong Aofu asked, but her face was full of smiles — she had already guessed Yang Kai's thoughts and was no longer anxious.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, pulled Yin Sudie to her feet, and nodded: "Since Sect Master Gong has such intent, it would be heartless of me to turn you away. From now on, those under Liuli Sect will be disciples of my Lingxiao Sect. I hope we can share hardships together!"

Gong Aofu received the answer she wanted and was joyous beyond measure: "Thank you, Sect Master!" she said as she bowed.

She immediately altered the way she addressed Yang Kai, drawing their relations closer.

"Disciple greets Sect Master!" Yin Sudie likewise performed a graceful salute; her pretty face blushed, her cheeks like rosy clouds, provoking limitless fancy.

But Yang Kai, who understood her nature deeply, was not taken in by this feigned purity.

That little wench cultivated charm arts; altering one's aura to attract men's attention was the simplest thing in the world for her.

She did not even think of letting go of Yang Kai's hand; instead she clasped it back, wearing an expression of savoring the sweetness.

The corner of Yang Kai's mouth lifted slightly; he cast her a meaningful glance, withdrew his hand without leaving a trace, and said, "Sect Master Gong, your strength is not poor. Since you have entered Lingxiao Sect, take up the post of Elder; the original disciples of Liuli Sect will fall under your command."

Gong Aofu's mouth opened slightly, her beautiful eyes full of gratitude.

Although they faced no rejection or oppression after joining the Lingxiao Sect, Yang Kai did not dissolve the former disciples of Liuli Sect. Instead, he allowed Gong Aofu to continue leading them and even granted her the position of Elder — a gesture that moved the beautiful woman deeply.

"In the future, if opportunity arises, Elder Gong may also restore Liuli Sect's former glory — I will not forbid it!" Yang Kai considered and then dropped another bombshell.

Gong Aofu immediately displayed the look of someone who would die for a kindred spirit; her eyes reddened slightly as she bowed deeply: "I thank Sect Master for your mercy. I will spare no effort to add to Lingxiao Sect's foundations and not fail Sect Master's great hopes!"

She was now truly devoted to Yang Kai with all her heart.

Originally joining Lingxiao Sect had been an expedient measure to protect Liuli Sect's last bloodline, but receiving such great reward was beyond expectation — how could Gong Aofu not be moved?

For a moment, others from the various Sects showed expressions of regret.
