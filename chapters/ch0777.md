## Chapter 777 — Demon General Xueli

But at this moment her beautiful eyes swam with murderous intent, and her True Yuan slithered off her like a venomous snake, exuding an icy danger that made the skin crawl.

Yang Kai's eyelids tightened as he cursed Gou Chi inwardly—what a fool, provoking trouble and drawing such a woman down on them.

When he first arrived he hadn't dared release his Divine Sense to probe, and only when the woman struck did he realize Gou Chi had stirred up a truly fearsome expert.

She had clearly long since detected someone spying on her, and the moment she left the lake's surface she struck.

Gou Chi, acting brazen and reckless, clutched his cheek and shouted, "You filthy woman, you dare hit me?"

"So what if I hit you?" the woman said coldly, casting Gou Chi an icy glance. "Speak another insolent word and I'll kill you."

"You got the nerve?" Gou Chi sneered with a vicious grin. "Try touching even one finger of mine!"

No sooner had he spoken than a sharp burst of energy whistled forth and, with Gou Chi utterly unguarded, pierced clean through his shoulder.

Blood spurted like a fountain; Gou Chi's face went pallid and then drained of color as he stared up at the woman in the sky.

He hadn't expected her to act without a word; the stabbing pain in his shoulder threw him into a panic.

Though lecherous and rash, he was not utterly stupid; from the methods the woman had displayed repeatedly, even at his prime he could not have withstood her. With a bloody hole torn in his shoulder, Gou Chi instantly sobered—still furious in expression, but he dared not speak, only stared at her with venom.

"Humans?" the woman appraised Yang Kai and An Ling'er with a curious look, her brows knitting. "When did demons and humans start colluding? How interesting."

Yang Kai's expression turned grim as he subtly sheltered An Ling'er behind him, his True Yuan quietly surging as he prepared to act.

"Hmph!" she sniffed with disdain, descending from the void in an array of grace, flicking her wet hair as she glanced at Gou Chi and the other demon. "Your True Yuan and Divine Sense were sealed—could it be this human boy who tampered with them?"

Gou Chi said nothing, but the other demon slowly shook his head and explained, "Not him. We were trapped and our powers sealed by the locals; it was only thanks to this human that we managed to escape."

"Pathetic!" the woman grew icily contemptuous. "My demon sons must stoop to human tricks to survive? What right have you to live in this world!"

Saying this, her long fingers snapped, and several threads of energy shot forth.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Several bloody holes appeared on the demon's body; he emitted a muffled groan, half-kneeling and gasping, his eyes full of terror and astonishment.

She did not finish him; it seemed she was merely displeased they had relied on Yang Kai's power, giving them only a mild punishment.

"So, you have some skill then?" she asked with renewed interest, eyeing Yang Kai. A soft, feminine Divine Sense swept over him like cold air, examining him from head to toe.

"Not that impressive!" she scoffed, withdrawing her attention from him.

After a moment's thought she sneered, "You dared insult me—you're bold indeed. You need discipline. But I'm in a good mood today, so I won't kill you; come back with me."

At that she flicked her hand and a carriage-like Secret Treasure materialized; at its center lay a huge fragrant bed draped in pink curtains that filled the air with an intoxicating scent.

She stepped onto the carriage, and through the curtains sent two bolts of energy that struck Gou Chi and the other demon.

Instantly the seals on their powers were lifted and both brightened with relief.

"You human girl, come up!" she called, reclining on the fragrant bed, her graceful curves exposed as she lounged lazily and beckoned to An Ling'er.

An Ling'er was on high alert; she glanced at Yang Kai and hesitated.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod, and An Ling'er then climbed onto the carriage and stood there extremely restrained.

"You three carry her, then—need me to show you how?" the woman asked lazily, her voice soft and alluring.

Yang Kai couldn't help but frown.

Gou Chi snapped angrily, "Who do you think you are, wanting me to be your palanquin-bearer? Do you know who I am?"

"I don't care who you are. If you don't want to die you'd better obey, or I'll gladly send you on your way!" a cold flash crossed her beautiful eyes as True Yuan coalesced between her long fingers, ready to kill Gou Chi should he refuse.

Gou Chi's eyes writhed with rage, but faced with absolute power he had to relent; he trudged forward and shouldered the carriage.

Yang Kai and the other demon exchanged a helpless look and went up as well.

Guided by the woman's directions, the three bearers ran swiftly.

On the fragrant bed An Ling'er sat like a porcupine on needles, watching the surroundings while following the woman's orders to massage her shoulders.

The woman said little, simply reclining with her eyes closed, thoroughly at ease.

The perfume trailed behind them and Yang Kai seethed—he had intended to use Gou Chi's help to get out of the Demon Domain safely, but that now seemed unlikely; Gou Chi could not even protect himself, so Yang Kai had to think of another plan.

Half a day later a vast city came into view near the Sand Sea; its towering walls appeared to be molded from fused sand, the whole city tinged a dusty yellow.

Countless demons flowed through its streets.

As the carriage flew over the city, Gou Chi suddenly widened his eyes and blurted, "Sand City? So you are—"

"Silence!" the woman barely opened her eyes and quietly commanded.

Gou Chi shrank his head and fell silent, clearly terrified and all his former swagger gone.

Yang Kai watched the exchange, his expression shifting.

Soon the carriage hovered above Sand City and, at the woman's command, the group quickly arrived before a colossal palace at the center of the city.

The palace was built in an extraordinary fashion, as if seated atop a mountain of a hundred blades, rising several hundred zhang into the sky.

Flying up to that height and peering down, the entire city lay beneath their feet, a strangely magnificent sight.

The palace's style was at odds with the rest of the city: its floors were pure white jade, its halls carved with dragons and phoenixes, opulent and glittering.

Precious crystals hung everywhere.

Upon the carriage's arrival, a powerful demon immediately stepped forward and bowed respectfully, saying, "My Lady, welcome back."

The woman inclined her head slightly and stepped down from the carriage.

"And these people are...?" the demon scrutinized Yang Kai and the others; when he saw Gou Chi a flicker of doubt crossed his face, a look of recognition in his eyes.

"Send word to Gou Qiong—tell him that if he wants to see his son alive he should prepare a substantial ransom," the woman said coldly, glancing at Gou Chi. "Also report the other three; whether he ransoms them is his affair."

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed as he realized she had already seen through Gou Chi's identity, yet still treated him so. From how she addressed Gou Qiong her rank became clear.

Gou Qiong was one of the Four Great Demon Generals; only another Demon General would dare treat him so brazenly.

Among the Four Great Demon Domains there was only one woman—Xueli!

Her name sounded delicate and lovely; she was beautiful and well-formed, yet utterly ruthless and brutal.

To have accidentally crossed paths with a Demon General—and for Gou Chi to have so recklessly provoked her while attempting to ogle her body—was outrageous.

Yang Kai wanted nothing more than to tear Gou Chi to pieces to vent his hatred.

"I reckon Gou Qiong will not concern himself with the lives of those three," one of Xueli's subordinates said with a sinister smile, taking cruel pleasure in Yang Kai and the others' plight.

"Report it anyway. And tell Gou Qiong that this human boy saved his son," Xueli instructed with emphasis. "I want to see how Gou Qiong will handle this."

"Oh? That is surprising indeed—the scion of a Demon General saved by a human… interesting. I'll go and notify him at once."

"Go," Xueli waved her hand.

"Lady Xue! Lady Xue!" Gou Chi cried out anxiously.

"What is it?" Xueli glanced at him.

"Can't this be negotiated? I'll scrape together the ransom myself—don't trouble my father," Gou Chi pleaded awkwardly, clearly fearful of Gou Qiong's retribution.

"This is not for you to decide," Xueli snorted, ignoring him as she turned and entered the palace.

Another demon soon came and led Yang Kai and the other three inside.

Each was given a side chamber, while An Ling'er was placed beside Xueli.

Unlike the severe restrictions in the Yang Clan, Xueli appeared confident—she did not confine Yang Kai and the others; meals were brought three times daily and the food was good, she did not stint them.

Though left unwatched, Yang Kai behaved himself; he had no intention of fleeing.

In Xueli's presence he felt escape impossible, and with An Ling'er bound to her side Yang Kai could not abandon her to save himself.

Gou Chi seemed to grasp his mistake; he grew sullen and listless by day, his previous arrogance completely gone.

Xueli had already sent word to Gou Qiong and, without sparing the fellow General's face, demanded a large ransom; Yang Kai guessed Gou Qiong would not care about the fate of him and An Ling'er—at most he would ransom Gou Chi and the other demon.
