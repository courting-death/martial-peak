## Chapter 106 — Taking Them Down One by One

Only after confirming that the other two were nowhere nearby did Yang Kai leap down from the treetops and begin tracking the weakest among them, Junior Brother Wu.

Junior Brother Wu himself possessed the strength of the Qi Movement Realm, Ninth Stage, making him a formidable opponent. Yet now, with his power sealed, he could only muster less than forty percent of his true ability. At this moment, he was cautiously searching the dense forest for any trace of Yang Kai. Unfortunately, although he had followed a trail of blood, it had vanished nearly a tea’s time ago.

The valley was thick with trees, making it truly difficult to locate a single person.

Wu did not overlook a single suspicious spot, occasionally glancing up at the treetops. However, the dim light only added to the challenge of his search.

He dared not let his two senior brothers get ahead! If they found Yang Kai first, the Earth-Grade secret treasure would be lost to him.

An Earth-Grade secret treasure! The thought alone ignited a fire in Wu’s heart. If he could claim it, his standing within the gang would rise accordingly. With such a treasure, defeating a Separation and Union Realm warrior would be no great feat.

As he searched, a sudden rustling sound came from behind.

Startled, Wu spun around and shouted, “Who’s there?”

He scanned the surroundings, gripping his long sword tightly, alert. Yet he saw nothing. The rustling continued intermittently, caused only by the cold wind stirring the trees.

He chastised himself for being overly jumpy. In this valley, besides his Blood Battle Gang comrades, only Yang Kai and that woman remained. Both were barely able to protect themselves; they would not recklessly seek death here.

Chuckling softly, Wu turned back to continue his pursuit.

But just as his mind relaxed, a scorching sensation suddenly pressed down from above. His skin tightened as a deadly aura surged toward him.

Startled, he looked up, eyes widening in shock. “Yang Kai...!”

Before he could finish, Yang Kai had already descended above him, head downward like a hunting eagle, poised to strike. A crimson glow flared on his palm as he brought it crashing down toward Wu’s head.

The sudden attack came too swiftly. Wu barely managed to parry with a sword flourish before Yang Kai’s palm struck.

In panic, Wu twisted his head aside, narrowly avoiding a fatal blow.

With a thunderous crack, Yang Kai’s palm smashed into Wu’s shoulder. The sound of breaking bones rang out as Wu’s entire arm sagged, severed cleanly.

“Ah!” The searing Yuan Qi surged into Wu’s body, and he screamed in agony. Shaking his sword, he slashed toward Yang Kai’s neck.

Yang Kai flipped backward through the air, his feet grazing the blade’s edge, narrowly evading the strike. Landing lightly, he sprang forward like a serpent emerging from its den. His feet bounced off the ground as his hands fluttered like butterflies, wrapping around Wu’s sword-wielding right hand. With a push and pull, he disrupted Wu’s balance and executed a swift back throw, slamming him to the ground decisively.

The entire sequence was so rapid it dazzled the eyes, flowing seamlessly like clouds and water.

Falling to the earth, Wu spat a mouthful of blood. Yang Kai’s knee pressed against his shoulder blade as both hands gripped tightly.

Crack... Wu’s right arm shattered instantly.

A wail of agony escaped him. In mere moments, Wu’s hands were rendered useless, and he was completely pinned beneath Yang Kai’s foot.

Yang Kai’s gaze was cold and emotionless. With a single kick, he swept up Wu’s fallen sword and drove it straight into his chest.

“How... how is this possible...” Wu’s mouth foamed with blood, disbelief etched on his face.

How could you still have the strength to fight? You are merely an Open Origin Realm warrior — you should be utterly exhausted!

“Senior Brother Yuan, damn it! Junior Brother, you’ve been doomed by him!” The last thought flashed through Wu’s mind as his eyes dimmed and lost all light.

Having slain Wu, Yang Kai panted slightly, his wounds threatening to burst open again as fresh blood flowed.

Wasting no time, he bent over the corpse and searched carefully, soon retrieving his Azure Blood Mysterious Yang Pill.

Not only that, Wu carried other valuables: a small half-bottle of Minor Recovery Pills and some silver notes, all of which Yang Kai pocketed.

Hoisting Wu’s body, Yang Kai leapt back into the trees, concealing the corpse among the branches before dropping down and rushing off in another direction.

Time was pressing. Less than two hours remained before dawn, and he still had to eliminate at least four more enemies, one of whom was even a True Yuan Realm expert. The road ahead was long and arduous.

As his strength grew, the range of the Yang Source Seal on his chest expanded significantly. Yang Kai estimated he could sense Yang energy within two hundred zhang.

Two hundred zhang was a great distance. Normally, such movement would not escape the keen senses of Separation and Union Realm warriors. But now, Yang Kai was the master within this radius.

After running for less than the time of a single incense stick, Yang Kai suddenly halted. He sensed another presence.

Yet this person remained motionless, doing who knew what. Yang Kai waited a moment, but the figure still did not move.

Moreover, Yang Kai sensed something strange about the spot where the figure stood. It seemed as if the valley’s Yin energy was converging there.

Frowning, Yang Kai stealthily approached.

After a short while, he closed within thirty zhang and concealed himself behind a large tree, quietly observing.

Thirty zhang away stood a blurry figure, and not far in front of him was a small, bright white object radiating light.

This object resembled a tiny sun, illuminating everything nearby with perfect clarity. Though no larger than a pigeon’s egg, it emitted a bone-chilling cold that could shatter even a soul.

At this moment, the object spun ceaselessly. As it rotated, the valley’s Yin energy seemed drawn irresistibly toward it.

Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew!

Yang Kai recognized it instantly.

Though he had never seen it before, he knew what it was at a glance. Xia Ningshang had brought him to this place where Yin energy gathered to refine this very treasure.

So this was the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew! Yang Kai had thought it was merely a drop of dew, but now he realized it possessed a certain sentience, truly absorbing the Yin energy of heaven and earth.

As Yang Kai observed silently, the figure thirty zhang away finally moved.

It was Junior Brother Ye. Having failed to track Yang Kai, he unexpectedly discovered the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew here. Though unaware of its true value, he knew it was a treasure.

After watching cautiously for some time, he could no longer resist making his move.
