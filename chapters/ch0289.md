## Chapter 289 — Dragon Confinement Ravine

The third stage, the true heart-to-heart connection, would allow even if the two were separated by dozens or hundreds of zhang, their True Yuan would resonate with each other, flowing endlessly and ceaselessly.

As the two combined their energies, their combat power surged, enabling them to utilize many secret techniques of the Dual Cultivation Technique.

True Yuan flowed from Yang Kai into Su Yan, and then back from Su Yan to Yang Kai. Their True Yuan fused and tempered, becoming increasingly pure and vigorous. Over time, not only did their True Yuan begin to intertwine, but their consciousness also seemed to converge.

An intangible and formless consciousness entwined, each desiring that miraculous contact. Without the need for words, they could clearly sense each other's thoughts. Every touch sent shivers through both of them.

A dragon's roar faintly emanated from Yang Kai, while a phoenix's cry responded from within Su Yan.

In the room where they cultivated, a haze of dragon and phoenix appeared. If one were to remove their clothes and look closely, they would see a dragon and a phoenix rapidly swimming across the backs of Yang Kai and Su Yan, respectively. Accompanied by their movements, their dual cultivation was more efficient than ever before.

This breakthrough in dual cultivation lasted a full five days, with the fusion and tempering of their True Yuan washing away all impurities from this Second-Tier period.

Not only did Yang Kai's strength stabilize and increase significantly, but Su Yan also reaped tremendous benefits.

There was no intimacy or bone-gnawing passion, but both felt that this kind of dual cultivation was what they had long desired, a touching of their souls.

Until parting, Yang Kai did not engage in any unnecessary actions.

Because during this Second-Tier period, Su Yan had been honing herself with the thoughts and desires in her heart. If Yang Kai were to act recklessly now, it might disrupt the mindset she had maintained for over a year, causing her efforts to go to waste.

For Su Yan's sake, Yang Kai had to endure.

Before leaving, Yang Kai gifted Su Yan Ling Taixu's Spatial Pouch, which contained dozens of pounds of Wan Yao Ling Ye, over ten pounds of Wan Yao Ling Milk, and two bottles of Wan Yao Ling Paste.

Long-term consumption of Wan Yao Ling Ye could improve a person's constitution. Such a good thing naturally had to be shared with his woman. It wouldn’t take long; with just a month or two of persistence, Su Yan would likely undergo a transformation.

Her innate talent was already top-notch, and after another transformation, her future achievements would undoubtedly be limitless.

In addition, he left a drop of Soul Cleansing Dew and Liuyan Liquid behind. Su Yan could refine the Liuyan Liquid now to assist in tempering her True Yuan, while the Soul Cleansing Dew would naturally be useful when she broke through to the Divine Roaming Realm.

These were all items she would need soon.

After leaving Su Yan's small loft, Yang Kai flew straight to the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Before getting close, he saw waves of evil black aura rising from below the Dragon Confinement Ravine, gathering upwards.

In the sky above the Dragon Confinement Ravine, a large mass of black mist obscured the view, and a pervasive malevolent aura surged towards him.

Since the Sect Leader's second disciple broke through, the once peaceful Dragon Confinement Ravine had turned into this.

The evil energy here was dense; for the time being, it wouldn’t have too much impact, but if this continued, the area within hundreds of li would no longer be suitable for habitation.

The disciples of the three nearby sects would be implicated.

During this period, the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower had already come to the Lingxiao Pavilion to demand an explanation. However, with the Sect Leader severely wounded and unconscious, and one of the five elders already dead, they could only leave without a resolution upon seeing the desolation.

Di Mo was unusually excited, and without waiting for Yang Kai to summon it, it actively emerged. Streams of black aura gathered towards the Soul-Breaking Spike, and Di Mo opened its mouth wide to absorb them, like a sponge, devouring all the malevolent aura.

The malevolent aura, which was unbearable for ordinary people, was a great supplement for Di Mo.

Not only did its soul require such things, but the repair of the Soul-Breaking Spike also urgently needed the malevolent demonic energy.

The current state of the Lingxiao Pavilion was precisely the paradise it desired.

Reaching the edge of the Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Kai looked down and saw that in the depths, black serpentine dragons seemed to be rolling and boiling. All of this was formed from the extremely dense malevolent and fierce aura, turning the bottom of the Dragon Confinement Ravine into a birthplace of evil energy.

“Did you discover anything when you absorbed the demonic energy beneath the Dragon Confinement Ravine?” Yang Kai frowned and asked.

“I didn’t find anything; it was just that the deeper I went, the denser the demonic energy became. However, the evil aura here seems somewhat different from before,” Di Mo pondered.

“What’s different?” Yang Kai pressed.

“It seems to be purer and denser than before. Originally, there was a force suppressing the evil aura below. The Yang attribute energy you absorbed here previously was the existence that suppressed the evil aura, but now that suppression has loosened quite a bit.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, no longer speaking.

He too had noticed that the Yang attribute energy here was much thinner than before.

After a moment, he jumped down, and while in mid-air, he activated his True Yuan to stabilize his form, then refracted and entered his cave abode.

The cave abode remained unchanged, with everything inside decorated and arranged bit by bit by Su Yan and Xia Ningshang.

At the entrance, two pots of flowers had already withered. These were the two pots Meng Wuya had placed at the Contribution Hall counter, now completely wilted due to the influence of the evil aura.

Next to the two pots of flowers was a small pit, which should have been the rooting place of the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, but now it was nowhere to be found.

Since that day when the Lingxiao Pavilion underwent a great change, Su Yan hadn’t seen it.

The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng was a Spiritual Herb that had developed its own consciousness. When it sensed danger, it would autonomously hide. It was likely that on that day when the evil master emerged, the boiling demonic energy from the Dragon Confinement Ravine startled it.

However… it shouldn’t have escaped.

It loved the dual energies of Yin and Yang, and besides the Dragon Confinement Ravine, there was no other place nearby where it could stay.

Closing his eyes, he slowly released his Divine Sense, searching the vicinity.

As his Divine Sense spread, he faintly sensed a hint of danger coming from below the Dragon Confinement Ravine. Yang Kai didn’t dare to delve deeper, only searching from above.

After a moment, Yang Kai's expression brightened as he located the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng.

Just as he had predicted, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng had merely hidden itself, just a few li away in a mountain crevice.

Extending his Divine Sense, he released his goodwill. The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng quickly sensed that this familiar aura came from Yang Kai and transformed into a stream of light, flying towards him.

Moments later, the red-and-white Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng reappeared before Yang Kai, diving directly into his embrace, revealing only a portion of itself, its delicate features filled with fear and trepidation.

Yang Kai laughed heartily, extending a finger to extract a drop of Yang Liquid and pour it into its body. The Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng eagerly absorbed it, its expression immediately brightening.

“I’ll get you a new home, absolutely safe, and no one will disturb you again!” Yang Kai spoke softly, not waiting for its reaction before directly placing it into the Black Book space.

The Black Book space cannot contain living beings, but it has no problem with rare flowers and herbs. Although the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng had become sentient, it was still a type of rare flower and herb, so staying in the Black Book space wouldn’t pose a problem.

Once inside the vast space, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng curiously surveyed the empty surroundings and soon discovered the presence of Wan Yao Ling Ye.

With a flicker, it attempted to root itself near the Wan Yao Ling Ye.

Yang Kai sensed something was amiss and quickly constructed a secluded space with his Divine Sense, hiding those treasures away.

Seeing that the good stuff had vanished, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng immediately looked aggrieved, bouncing around and transforming into a stream of light, frantically searching for the Wan Yao Ling Ye within the Black Book space.

“I’ll give you a drop every ten days; just stay here obediently!” Yang Kai helplessly conveyed through his Divine Sense. Upon hearing this, the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng finally settled down.

After settling the Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, Yang Kai turned and walked into the cave abode, collecting all the items he had left here into the Black Book space. These items were all treasures obtained from the overseas hidden islands, belonging to various sects.

Each item was a blade that could not be seen in the light.

Returning to the entrance, Yang Kai gazed at the swirling demonic energy below, lost in thought.

Di Mo noticed Yang Kai's thoughts and tentatively asked, “Young Master, do you want to go down?”

“En.” Yang Kai nodded. There must be some mysteries below; otherwise, Ling Taixu's second disciple wouldn’t have been able to recover his strength and master the evil technique.

This was the battlefield between the ancestors of the Lingxiao Pavilion and a demon several hundred years ago, and Yang Kai naturally wanted to descend to uncover the truth.

The swirling demonic energy was a barrier that obstructed most people’s progress, and even many evil beings might not withstand the malevolent and fierce aura.

But with Di Mo protecting him and his Proud Bone Golden Body being inherently evil and mysterious, he was not without hope.

With this thought, Yang Kai's resolve strengthened, and he directly jumped down from the cave entrance.

Di Mo was secretly astonished by Yang Kai's boldness and quickly became vigilant.

The wind howled past his ears as his body fell straight down, the speed increasing rapidly. In the blink of an eye, he fell several hundred zhang, plunging directly into the rolling fierce aura.

In the next moment, it felt as if he had been pierced, and he quickly activated the Wings of Yang Flame, bursting out from below, his expression filled with pain as he looked down in trepidation.

At the moment he fell into the fierce aura, Yang Kai felt his soul under attack. It was an assault filled with despair, brutality, bloodlust, and coldness, all hidden within the fierce aura below.

Intangible and formless, it was impossible to defend against.

Even though Yang Kai had already cultivated his Divine Sense, he could not withstand such attacks, his head pounding.

Di Mo, however, was unafraid, suffering no harm.

With a light leap, it clung to the nearby rock wall. Yang Kai gazed down, his face serious as he pondered for a moment before diving down again.

The overwhelming fierce aura enveloped his entire body, thick and terrifying, and being in such malevolent and fierce energy sent chills down Yang Kai's spine.

A peculiar attack once again surged towards his soul from all directions, like thousands of ants gnawing or hundreds of needles piercing his mind, accompanied by faint sounds of ghostly wails.

He felt as if he had fallen into the hell of Shura.
