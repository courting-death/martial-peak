## Chapter 628 — Enchantress

Three squads had originally numbered over twenty, but at this moment fewer than half still lived.

The lives of warriors of the Divine Roaming Realm seemed astonishingly fragile at this instant.

Faces were flurried with panic and grief; there was no time to mourn the dead, only a single urge to flee.

Yang Kai walked at the rear of the group, his Divine Sense restrained and not daring to be let loose; the enemy who had slain Sun Ying had not yet revealed themselves again, yet his keen perception told him a pair of eyes were closely watching their movements.

They watched with an air of composed amusement, as though enjoying the sight of prey fleeing, savoring the delight of the quarry's panic.

Yang Kai's expression darkened; he realized this trouble was likely serious.

Unable to judge the foe's true strength or see their true form, he could only take things one step at a time.

Every survivor of the Duao Alliance felt dread and unease in their hearts.

Swoosh...

A sharp sound of air being split suddenly rang out; everyone changed color, came to a halt, and warily scanned their surroundings as their strength condensed inward.

There was nothing to be seen.

Yet Ji Hong cried out in alarm, "Miss, Zheng Wu—"

At that sound, people looked toward the warrior called Zheng Wu and found him staring blankly, the light gone from his eyes, like a wooden stake planted in the ground; the life force stored within his body was rapidly ebbing away.

"Zheng Wu..." someone who had been closer to him whispered, but received no response.

That person reached out and pushed Zheng Wu; Zheng Wu toppled stiffly to the ground, sending up a cloud of dust.

Ruan Xinyu gave a startled cry, one small hand covering her reddened lips, her face drained of color.

"Zheng Wu is dead!" Ji Hong's eyes widened, his face a mask of disbelief.

Yun Xuan also appeared greatly shaken; her delicate face turned ashen as she gazed about, but could find no trace of the enemy.

Zhou Luo couldn't help but tremble.

Zheng Wu was a member of his squad, possessed of the level of a Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage warrior, and yet, under the eyes of so many, he had been killed silently and without a single wound on his body.

Such a turn of events left Zhou Luo feeling as if plunged into an icehouse; a chill rose within him.

If the hidden enemy could slay Zheng Wu with such a method, they could just as easily kill anyone among them.

Realizing the situation, none of them knew what to do.

"Keep moving!" Yang Kai's face was dark as he barked out orders.

In that fleeting instant he felt a sinister, overwhelming Divine Sense strike at him and vanish.

The strength of that Divine Sense was such that even he felt a pang of unease. It was precisely by using an invisible, formless Divine Sense that the hidden foe could kill a Divine Roaming Realm warrior without leaving a trace.

Indeed, if that person wished, they could take all of their lives at any time.

Yet they did not.

Yang Kai could only think of one possibility: this person’s temperament was twisted, delighting in watching others struggle in hopelessness.

Such an enemy was extremely troublesome. Yang Kai had to find their flaw—if he could not reverse the kill, at least he had to find a way to escape.

Hearing his command, Yun Xuan finally pulled herself together somewhat; her face steadied and she waved her hand, saying, "Move!"

The dozen or so continued forward and soon came to the sealing formation Sun Ying had set earlier; before entering the mine cave he had activated the formation, wrapping the entire cave in a barrier to prevent the Gold Devouring Beasts from escaping. Now that very barrier had become an obstruction to their escape.

If they wished to leave, they had to break Sun Ying's sealing formation.

Yun Xuan, Ruan Xinyu and Zhou Luo hurriedly joined hands to dismantle it.

No sooner had they begun than another faint sound came.

Clink...

A Divine Roaming Realm warrior toppled straight down again, dead in an instant like Zheng Wu before him.

His Sea of Consciousness had been destroyed; no one could survive that.

Yun Xuan and the others shuddered and dared not make another move for fear of drawing the killer's attention; the perilous situation offered no semblance of safety.

They waited for a long time and nothing else occurred.

Yun Xuan and the others took a breath, looked at each other, and set to work dismantling the sealing formation once more.

Swoosh...

A third person fell.

Ruan Xinyu suddenly began to weep, tears sliding down her face like beads of rain; her delicate shoulders trembled as she cried, "What on earth is happening—who is silently striking us?"

Yun Xuan drew a deep breath. Though terror showed on her face, she struggled to steady herself and cried out in a trembling voice, "Is there a master present? Show yourself! We are disciples of the Duao Alliance, here on a mission. If we have offended you in any way, please forgive us."

"Giggle..." A string of silver-bell laughter suddenly entered everyone’s ears, imbued with an irresistible allure; when it sounded, no one could help but feel a stir in their hearts and a flush of heat in their bodies.

"You dared seize my Demonic Beasts; you must pay the price," the voice floated about, elusive and impossible to pinpoint, seeming to whisper at their ears and yet to come from everywhere at once.

Yun Xuan's face darkened; she forced a smile and said, "We did not know those Demonic Beasts had an owner; had we known—"

"No need to explain. I only want to kill you for sport. Struggle all you like, giggle..." The voice was soft and honeyed, blood-hot when heard; an odd sensation rose in the heart, making one wish to turn into a beast and find the voice's owner, to ravage and trample her, stirring every man's most primitive instincts and impulses.

Yang Kai silently circulated the Dual Cultivation Technique to dispel the agitation in his chest, a concealed smile touching the corner of his mouth.

He found his guess about the hidden enemy confirmed: their temperament was indeed twisted and strange. Such a person was dangerous, but also arrogant; if he waited, she would surely reveal a flaw.

Yang Kai now most feared that she would attack him directly.

If she struck at him, he could no longer hide his true combat strength and would inevitably become her focus.

After that voice spoke, Yun Xuan's expression grew even grimmer as she hurriedly called out a few more times, but the voice no longer answered. Instead, the fourth Duao Alliance warrior fell dead right before their eyes.

A great panic spread; Yun Xuan and the others fumbled in confusion as they pressed on with dismantling the formation.

One by one, the warriors dropped in succession; the killer's bloodlust surged, no longer content to strike singly—at times two or three would die with a single blow.

The number of Duao Alliance disciples plummeted; members of Yun Xuan's squad fell one after another.

Watching comrades they had lived with for years die without even seeing their enemy before they perished, Yun Xuan could not help but let tears fall; her heart ached.

Ji Hong had gone mad, brandishing his great axe with both hands and bellowing, "You filthy bitch, come out! Hiding and playing coy—are you too ugly to put your face in the open?"

No sooner had the words left his mouth than Ji Hong's body shuddered and froze. Though he still stood there with his axe like a wall of bronze and iron, those still alive could clearly feel Ji Hong's life force draining away.

"Ji Hong!" Yun Xuan called out in a trembling voice.

Yang Kai shook his head, his expression darkening with vexation.

That bearded man looked simple and lecherous but was a good sort; Yang Kai had a favorable impression of him.

Glancing around, on the Duao Alliance side only three people remained alive.

Whether by design or chance, the three survivors happened to be the captains of the three squads.

Including Yang Kai, that made four.

Having remained unharmed thus far made Yang Kai somewhat relieved, but with only four left, if she struck he would be at serious risk of being singled out.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai called out loudly, "Young lady, it's time to show yourself, isn't it? Even if I die, you must let me see exactly who it is that would kill me."

"Are you mad?" Zhou Luo shouted angrily, glaring at Yang Kai with a ferocious look.

The hidden enemy's methods were cruel and their temperament strange; they killed in great numbers. Now the sealing formation was nearly broken and they could escape. Zhou Luo could not understand why Yang Kai would speak at such a moment.

Was this not pouring oil on the fire?

What if she actually revealed herself...

Thinking this, Zhou Luo's eyeballs trembled.

Because in the void ahead, a blurred figure appeared, strange and gradually solidifying.

Seeing this silhouette, Zhou Luo's raging fury instantly calmed; a dreamy light filled his eyes and a look of affection suffused his face.

Not only Zhou Luo, even Yang Kai found his vision brighten, inexplicably feeling a strange emotion well up within him.

The woman in the sky was extremely beautiful: an oval face, a head of glossy black hair flowing to her waist and hips, eyes bright and full, lips thin and tender; her figure was slender and seemingly frail, evoking a desire to protect her.

Especially those pure, innocent eyes—eyes that could make any man in the world stir.

Her skin was fairer than frost and snow; though appearing fragile, her waist was tender and her hips curved, her bosom neither large nor small but perfectly proportioned. She wore a delicate leather cuirass, her flat belly and fine navel exposed, barefoot; those small feet were exquisite as porcelain, as though one would not dare touch them.

Zhou Luo's eyes flamed and his breath grew heavy as he stared unmoving at the woman, his expression softening in an instant.

Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart and went on alert.

He had never seen such a woman before; even Shan Qingluo, however bewitching, had never at first glance banished all hostility in one's heart.

But this woman could. When she revealed herself, Yang Kai suddenly felt the hostility in his heart vanish, replaced only by an urge to protect her.

Such a delicate and fragile woman, left unprotected, would surely be harmed quickly.

"Enchantress!" Yun Xuan cried out, her face going deathly pale.

Ruan Xinyu seemed to have discerned the woman's true identity as well; her body trembled and she couldn't help feeling ashamed and inferior.
