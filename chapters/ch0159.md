## Chapter 159 — Return

When this elder returned, he was accompanied by a severely injured disciple from Fengyu Tower. Under the inquiries of Xiao Ruohan and the experts from Fengyu Tower, this disciple recounted the events that had just transpired.

Before long, the experts from the Blood Battle Gang and Lingxiao Pavilion also found some disciples from their respective sects nearby. As the three parties verified the situation, they couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.

They discovered that the disciples who had entered were now all out, albeit scattered across various corners of the Black Wind Forest.

Although they did not know why this was the case, everyone felt that this should be a form of protection from the master of the Inheritance Celestial Cave towards the inheritors!

As a result, no one knew who had actually obtained the inheritance.

The experts from the three factions busied themselves, weaving through the Black Wind Forest to locate their respective disciples and ensure their safe return. Their attitudes towards these disciples were cautious and respectful, far more amiable than before.

After all, no one knew whether these disciples, who were currently only in the Open Origin Realm, would grow to a height that would earn them the admiration of the world in the future.

Even the usually hot-tempered leader of the Blood Battle Gang, Hu Man, wore a smile as he greeted each returning disciple, treating them with deference and continuously praising their performance, claiming they would surely become the pillars of the gang.

The disciples of the Blood Battle Gang were nearly driven to madness, unsure of what had gotten into their leader. Yet, many were moved to tears, pledging their loyalty on the spot, vowing to follow Hu Man to the death and dedicate their lives to the Blood Battle Gang, their hearts as steadfast as the sun and moon!

Hu Man laughed even more heartily.

To him, even if these disciples had not obtained the inheritance, they were still worthy of being courted! After all, each of them had gained something, more or less, from the experience.

The experts from Fengyu Tower and Lingxiao Pavilion were naturally aware of this. While they looked down on Hu Man's hypocrisy, they had no choice but to put on a friendly face and inquire after the well-being of the returning disciples.

The work of gathering the disciples continued for half a day, and many returned directly to their sects without being found by their elders. This only improved the situation for Yang Kai and Su Yan.

Of course, Su Yan was destined to be suspected, and there was nothing anyone could do to change that.

At this moment, Yang Kai and Su Yan stood at a certain spot on Black Wind Mountain. After stepping through that light gate, they had arrived here. Su Yan was not very familiar with this place, but Yang Kai had traversed Black Wind Mountain several times, making him much more adept.

After searching for a long time, they finally found the correct path.

“Fifty miles that way, and we will reach Wumei Town,” Yang Kai said, pointing in a direction from atop a small hill.

“We need to split up and cannot return together,” Su Yan pondered for a moment before speaking. Since she was bound to be suspected, she could not expose Yang Kai as well.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded. “You go back first. There are definitely many people looking for you now. If you return late, it will only solidify their suspicions. Remember, no matter who asks, do not admit to having obtained the inheritance.”

“I understand. Be careful yourself and come back early,” Su Yan urged, turning to leave, but was suddenly pulled back by Yang Kai.

“What’s wrong?” Su Yan asked, just as a wave of scorching heat enveloped her, pulling her tightly in.

Soft whimpers escaped her lips as she melted into his embrace once more.

After a long while, Yang Kai finally released her with a chuckle.

“Remember what you said, to find me once a month!” Yang Kai said.

Su Yan gently nodded.

The two exchanged reluctant farewells. Although they both knew they were in the same sect, there was still a lingering sense of reluctance.

After waiting for a long time, Su Yan finally stamped her foot and gritted her teeth. “I’m leaving.”

With that, she swiftly departed, leaving behind a pure and graceful silhouette.

Yang Kai watched her disappear from view, shaking his head with a smile, leisurely setting off towards Lingxiao Pavilion.

The Inheritance Celestial Cave… Yang Kai felt that his greatest gain this time was not the inheritance itself, but Su Yan!

Several hours later, Yang Kai returned to Lingxiao Pavilion at a leisurely pace. By this time, the disciples and experts within the pavilion had already returned, though some were still trickling back. Yang Kai did not attract any attention.

However, he noticed a strange phenomenon; as he walked through the pavilion, those unfamiliar senior brothers or junior brothers treated him with great courtesy. Although they did not come over to chat, they greeted him with clasped fists and smiles from a distance.

Among them was even a steward from Lingxiao Pavilion.

After pondering for a moment, Yang Kai felt relieved. Those who had survived the Inheritance Celestial Cave might have boundless prospects in the future; why would they still ignore him like before? A simple greeting now could pave the way for future friendships.

Upon returning to his small wooden house, he had yet to gather his thoughts when hurried footsteps sounded from outside.

As he wondered who it could be, Su Mu's face appeared.

Seeing Yang Kai, Su Mu let out a sigh of relief. “Senior Brother Yang, you’ve returned safely!”

Yang Kai felt a warmth in his heart and stood up. “Junior Brother Su, come in and sit!”

“No need, I just came to see if you were alright.” As he spoke, Su Mu revealed a mischievous smile. “I still have to hurry back to practice, hahaha!”

With a hearty laugh, Su Mu disappeared.

Yang Kai was taken aback, suddenly recalling that he had not seen Su Mu's figure at the Endless Steps. Where had he gone? With the commotion caused by the Beast Soul Opening Cloud Array, he couldn’t possibly have missed it.

Unless he had other matters to attend to at that time!

Considering Su Mu's earlier proud demeanor, Yang Kai couldn’t help but smile slightly.

It seemed that he was not the only one to have obtained the inheritance; this kid Su Mu had some good fortune too!

After Su Mu left, Yang Kai had barely settled down when light footsteps echoed outside, this time sounding like a woman’s.

Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat. Just as he hesitated, a green figure flashed into the doorway.

“Little Junior Sister?” Yang Kai smiled upon recognizing the visitor.

His small wooden house was bustling today; Su Mu had come, and now Xia Ningshang was here. Moreover, he had not seen her in the Inheritance Celestial Cave.

Speaking of which, she had not sought him out since returning from Jiuyin Valley.

“Junior Brother!” Xia Ningshang sighed in relief upon seeing Yang Kai, not bothering with pleasantries as she walked straight in. “You’re back?”

“Mm, just returned,” Yang Kai nodded.

“I heard them say you also entered the Inheritance Celestial Cave… but I couldn’t find you,” Xia Ningshang said, her shyness evident as her ears turned red after just a couple of sentences.

“I saw you enter that day; Shopkeeper Meng was quite imposing,” Yang Kai recalled Meng Wuya’s arrogance that day, feeling a bit strange.

“Mm, my master sent me in. By the way, I found some Yang Stones there and refined some pills for you.” Xia Ningshang took out a bottle and handed it over. “You need this for your cultivation, right?”

Yang Kai smiled as he reached out to take it. “Thank you!”

Xia Ningshang shook her head lightly. “No need!”

“Do you want to sit down and rest for a while?”

“No, I just came to check on you.” Xia Ningshang hurriedly waved her hand, feeling shy in the presence of a lone man. “I’ll be going now; take care of yourself.”

“Mm.” Yang Kai did not insist. “You should also rest well and not overexert yourself.”

Xia Ningshang smiled gently, her eyes sparkling with satisfaction.

As she turned to leave, she paused at the door, as if wanting to ask something, but after hesitating for a long while, she ultimately lacked the courage and left.

The events that had transpired in Jiuyin Valley were still fresh in her memory.

That deep kiss, filled with confusion, often replayed in her mind during the midnight hours. Every time she thought of it, her heart raced like a lively deer, unable to calm down, tossing and turning, finding it hard to sleep.

It was that kiss that forever left an image of a bloodied figure in her heart. The feelings that surged within her made her even more bashful and flustered in front of Yang Kai, yet she dared not speak of it.

Watching Xia Ningshang leave, Yang Kai held the bottle in his hand, feeling a warmth in his heart.

A night passed without incident. On the first night back at Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai did nothing but sleep soundly.

The next day, he went to Black Wind Trading Market to purchase some Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs. He had intended to buy them during his last visit, but the appearance of the Inheritance Celestial Cave had disrupted his plans.

After the events of the Inheritance Celestial Cave, Black Wind Trading Market was not any quieter; in fact, it appeared even more bustling. Disciples from the three factions were eagerly discussing the various adventures and opportunities within the Inheritance Celestial Cave, as well as the nine powerful demon beasts and the final Endless Steps.

Most people had not been able to enter the Inheritance Celestial Cave, so they were naturally listening with rapt attention.

Su Yan was not stationed at Black Wind Trading Market. Currently, she was in the limelight and could not afford to leave Lingxiao Pavilion, as all eyes were on her, eager to know whether she had truly obtained the inheritance.

After purchasing the herbs and tools he needed, Yang Kai left Black Wind Trading Market directly.

Returning to Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai arrived at Dragon Confinement Ravine.

This was where he usually meditated and cultivated. The Three Yang Fruit trees still swayed in the wind, and perhaps in a few years, they would bear fruit, but that was destined to be a distant matter.

Yang Kai rubbed his hands together; he was about to do something he had long wanted to do, but back then, his strength was too low to attempt it. Now that he had reached the Qi Movement Realm, he finally had some capital.

He found a massive stone nearby and tied it with the rope he had bought. Using the rope, Yang Kai slowly descended towards the bottom of Dragon Confinement Ravine.

No one knew what kind of extraordinary treasures lay below, but even at the edge of the cliff, Yang Kai could absorb Yang Qi for cultivation. Regardless of what treasures were down there, the deeper he went, the more intense the Yang Qi became.

Yang Kai's appetite was not large; he did not intend to delve deep into Dragon Confinement Ravine to find those treasures. After all, that Elder Eleven had sternly warned him not to venture too deep, as even he would be in danger if he entered.

That mysterious Elder Eleven was at least a master of the Divine Roaming Realm. The danger he sensed was enough to lead Yang Kai to certain doom.
