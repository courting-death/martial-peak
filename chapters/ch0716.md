## Chapter 716 — Starry Sky Tempering

In the boundless starry void, an ochre veil of light enveloped Yang Kai and Zhai Yao, and within that veil a wanton energy darted about, rending at their bodies.

The two of them sat bare-chested, their towering forms exposed, clothing drenched in blood; countless wounds scored their flesh, which twitched and writhed without cease.

Though Zhai Yao bore a face more handsome than many women, his physical constitution was also extraordinarily strong—far beyond what an ordinary alchemist would possess. One could say Zhai Yao, like Yang Kai, was not only skilled in alchemy but also had real merit in combat.

Both men sat upright within the protection of a Secret Treasure, using that safeguard to temper their flesh while simultaneously comprehending the wondrous power of the starry void, hoping to reap benefits from it.

They had been in the starry void for two days. During that time Zhai Yao had been trying to relax his Secret Treasure’s protection to let the starry power surge in; the amount had grown gradually, and the gains for him were considerable.

Two days of tempering had made his body far more robust.

Yet Yang Kai was growing somewhat dissatisfied. When the starry power flowed in, he felt no pressure at all; it was Zhai Yao who seemed to be pushing his limits each time.

At that rate, Yang Kai could not hope for much further improvement.

After a moment’s thought, Yang Kai suddenly said, “Brother Zhai, let us separate. I think maintaining your Secret Treasure takes a great deal of True Yuan; without me you should have an easier time.”

Over the past two days Zhai Yao had continuously taken Pills to replenish his True Yuan, otherwise he would never have been able to sustain the Secret Treasure’s function.

The Pills he had brought were top-grade—evidently he had prepared well in advance.

At these words Zhai Yao frowned. “Separation is fine, but do you have a Saint-Grade Secret Treasure? A Saint-Grade Lower-Level one may not be sufficient; it must be at least Saint-Grade Middle-Level.”

“I think I won’t need a Secret Treasure,” Yang Kai said with an odd expression.

“What?” Zhai Yao clearly thought he had heard wrong. “You don’t mean to endure the starry power with your body, do you?”

“I’ll try first. If it doesn’t work, then we’ll speak of it,” Yang Kai proposed.

Zhai Yao knit his brow and after a long moment nodded slightly. “Be careful. Although I also feel your body may be stronger than mine, this is not a matter to joke about. This is the starry void—if your body is not strong enough there is only death. Even Saint Realm experts are no exception!”

“I know.” Yang Kai chuckled softly. “Then I’m going out.”

With those words he burst out of the protective range of Zhai Yao’s Secret Treasure.

Standing alone in the starry void, Yang Kai immediately felt a change: from all directions a strange energy surged, as if an invisible enemy were fiercely and remorselessly attacking him.

Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh...

Countless tiny cuts appeared across his towering frame and blood flowed forth, yet Yang Kai did not feel pain; instead his face shone with wild joy.

Indeed, his body could withstand the tearing of the starry power; it brought no threat to his life, and tempering here promised unimaginable gains.

Zhai Yao’s face went momentarily ashen; he twisted his mouth and, with envy and jealousy, spat, “Monster!”

He absolutely dared not leave the protection of his Secret Treasure. Though his physical quality was not poor, it was nowhere near Yang Kai’s level.

One could even say that, even given several more years, he might still fail to reach that height.

“How does it feel?” Zhai Yao soon calmed himself and asked curiously.

A smug look spread across Yang Kai’s face as he winked and pulled faces. “Brother Zhai, care to come out and try?”

“No thanks; I know my limits!” Zhai Yao hastily refused. “Well then, since you don’t need the Secret Treasure, let us separate and see who finds that Void Passage to the Tongxuan Continent first.”

“Agreed!” Yang Kai nodded heavily.

“It won’t be convenient to keep in touch here. If I find the Void Passage first and reach my limit with you not appearing, then I will leave.”

“Brother Zhai, don’t worry about me. When I’m done playing I’ll leave as well.”

“Be careful not to die.” Zhai Yao’s voice turned grave as he warned, “And there’s one more thing you must know: the starry power is not evenly distributed. It’s not constant. There may be places where the starry power is extremely dense—don’t go to such places. If you go there you might truly die!”

“Such places exist?” Yang Kai’s face lit with eagerness; he was thrilled at the prospect.

Zhai Yao rubbed his forehead, feeling a headache. He realized that while Yang Kai’s temperament was very similar to his own, there was one absolute difference: when faced with tremendous danger, Zhai Yao was the steady sort, whereas Yang Kai was the kind who delighted in taking risks.

“I’ve told you all I can. If you die it won’t be my concern—farewell for now, see you in Fuyun City!” Zhai Yao clasped his fist in salute, no longer wishing to bother Yang Kai, and turned away.

“Take this.” Yang Kai casually tossed an object to Zhai Yao.

“What is it?”

“A good thing.” Yang Kai grinned. “If you suffer a grievous wound, apply this externally and take it internally and you’ll recover quickly.”

“Thanks.” Zhai Yao smiled and promptly plunged into the starry void, growing more distant by degrees.

Watching his receding figure, Yang Kai gave a slight smile.

Yang Kai liked Zhai Yao—this time the acquisition of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower’s medicinal liquid had owed him much help; without Zhai Yao Yang Kai did not think he could have succeeded so smoothly.

Thus, before parting he had given him some Wan Yao Ling Milk.

In the past Yang Kai had had no contact with alchemy and could not distinguish high-grade medicinal materials, but now, being a spry and capable alchemist, his eye had widened considerably.

He could now distinguish the ranks within the Wan Yao Ling Ye series.

The lowest tier of Wan Yao Ling Ye was roughly Spirit-Grade; Wan Yao Ling Milk was Saint-Grade; even the smallest amount of Wan Yao Ling Paste Yang Kai could not yet discern, but he felt it was somewhat extraordinary—seemingly beyond the realm of Saint-Grade.

Giving Zhai Yao Wan Yao Ling Milk was his way of returning the favor.

He stood waiting quietly for a moment, then turned and walked in the exact opposite direction from Zhai Yao.

In the endless starry void the only point of reference was the planet of the Tongxuan Continent below. Yang Kai searched for Void Passages while tempering his body.

The starry power constantly tore at him; though it posed no threat to his life, it was still capable of wounding him.

In the blood that flowed from him, faint streaks of golden light could be seen.

That was the Demon God’s Blood.

Li Rong and Han Fei had both said that one day Yang Kai’s blood would be entirely golden; when that time came he would possess the sky-reaching arts of the legendary Great Demon God.

Yang Kai looked forward to that day.

Time slipped by; Yang Kai could not tell how long he wandered the void. At first the starry power could still harm his flesh, but as his body grew tougher those assaults felt like mere tickles.

He still had not discovered any Void Passage. He suspected he had gone the wrong way; the direction Zhai Yao took was likely where the Void Passage lay.

But he felt no hurry. He drifted through the starry void at will, seeking places suitable for tempering the flesh and comprehending the Way.

As Zhai Yao had said, the mysterious energies in the starry void were distributed very unevenly—some places were rich, others sparse.

Places of richer energy were precisely what Yang Kai sought; only there could he receive effective tempering.

Throughout this long wandering, Yang Kai’s temperament and martial arts grasp quietly improved; his thought and Divine Sense grew keener.

One day, while sitting in an energy-dense pocket of the void tempering his body and expanding his Divine Sense to ponder the mysteries of the starry void, he suddenly sensed something amiss.

He immediately plunged his spirit inward and probed carefully; after a moment he discovered the source of the anomaly.

It was coming from his Wordless Black Book.

More precisely, it originated from something within the Black Book Space.

The surrounding starry power was, in a very subtle manner and without leaving a trace, flowing into the Black Book Space, being absorbed by some thing inside.

Watching more closely, Yang Kai was astonished: the thing absorbing the starry power was actually those two jet-black spheres of unknown material and unknown use.

As the energy flowed in, those two black spheres began to flicker with a dim light, faint and intermittent, as if suddenly growing a hint of life.

Yang Kai was stupefied.

He keenly realized that to fathom the secret of those spheres, the starry power itself would likely be the key.

Elder Du’s old friend had kept those spheres for decades yet had found nothing precisely because he had never come to the starry void.

This was a fortunate coincidence, Yang Kai thought, and he concentrated his attention to see what changes the spheres would ultimately undergo.

Time passed and, after a while, Yang Kai slowly gave up waiting.

The two jet-black spheres had not changed much from the beginning; they continued to absorb starry power, their faint glow still flickering, yet no further progress occurred.

He shook his head, no longer wasting time watching them, rose to his feet, cast a casual glance around, chose a direction, and resumed his wanderings through the starry void.

Sitting here tempering his body had already consumed a great deal of the nearby starry power; if he did not find other places he could no longer refine himself.

Time and again he changed positions, and each place he found had richer energy than the last; Yang Kai’s body grew sturdy and resilient at a frightening pace.

Wounds on his body healed only to be covered by new layers of scars—countless and terrifying—but he relished them; though the pain was acute, it was supremely valuable.

Gradually he could no longer find a spot that could threaten his life; spaces that once would have spelled death for him he now traversed as if on a leisurely stroll, receiving no harm.

Although he believed that much deeper into the starry void there must be even more violent concentrations of energy, if he went any farther he worried he might not find his way back.
