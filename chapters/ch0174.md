## Chapter 174 — Black Mysterious Fruit

Yang Kai had been living quite steadily these days. Aside from sneaking out a few times at night, he had not made many moves.

The guards here were merely Qi Movement Realm martial artists, completely unable to detect his presence.

After several inquiries, Yang Kai discovered that aside from the courtyard he resided in, there were several other similar courtyards nearby, all housing many ordinary people who had been captured.

However, these people were vastly different from the ordinary individuals in his courtyard. Many of them appeared haggard and emaciated; despite being served mountain delicacies and herbal tonics daily, they struggled to regain their vitality.

Di Mo sensed something unusual from these people; they all carried a trace of demonic aura, which was not a result of their cultivation but rather an accidental contamination.

It was this demonic aura that was gnawing away at their lives.

Upon uncovering this information, Yang Kai had some vague suspicions about the Yunxia Sect's actions, though he did not dare to be too certain.

Half a month after being captured by the Yunxia Sect, Yang Kai and the other ordinary people had gained an additional task besides eating, sleeping, and recuperating.

That was to listen to a disciple of the Yunxia Sect explain the study of herbs.

Each person was given a small booklet filled with various illustrations and descriptions of rare herbs, along with methods for harvesting them.

The Yunxia Sect disciple explained for an hour each day, and Yang Kai studied diligently, knowing that such knowledge would be useful at any time.

This explanation lasted for half a month.

Yang Kai had been at the Yunxia Sect for a month now. During this time, he secretly cultivated and unexpectedly broke through, reaching the second stage of the Qi Movement Realm. He had not consumed any pills or absorbed Yang Qi, yet he achieved such results, which demonstrated just how rich the energy of heaven and earth was in this place.

If it were not for his current predicament, Yang Kai would have been quite pleased to remain here and cultivate.

One morning, after a month had passed, the disciple responsible for guarding the courtyard summoned everyone.

It was time for slaughter! Yang Kai thought to himself.

Combining the clues he had gathered earlier, Yang Kai was certain that the Yunxia Sect intended for these ordinary people to go to some perilous place to gather herbs, a place even their disciples were reluctant to tread.

As expected, the Yunxia Sect disciple proclaimed loudly, “Everyone, after a month at Yunxia, you have all grown quite a bit. This is the Sect's grace upon you. However, there is no free meal in this world. If you wish to continue living this comfortable life, you must do something for our Yunxia. This is also a test for you. As long as you pass, you can return here and continue your carefree existence.”

A sense of unease spread among the crowd. They were unsure of what he meant.

“Now, follow me.” He did not elaborate further, leading the group outside.

Following the path they had taken to reach the Yunxia Sect, after a full hour, they arrived at the seaside, where a large ship awaited.

Yang Kai noticed that many people had already gathered on the ship, including those he had seen during his nighttime excursions. They were all huddled together, many trembling with fear and panic on their faces.

Once over thirty people boarded the ship, nearly a hundred ordinary people had gathered. Those who boarded first cast glances at Yang Kai and the others, their eyes filled with an inexplicable sense of shared suffering.

“Is everyone here?” asked a middle-aged man who had reached the True Yuan Realm.

“Everyone is here.”

“Set sail!” The man waved his hand, and the ship slowly began to move.

At that moment, a voice filled with terror rang out: “I don’t want to go! I don’t want to go to that cursed place! Please, let me go! I won’t go there again!”

As he spoke, he howled in despair, staggering towards a Yunxia Sect martial artist, his face filled with panic. His eyes were bloodshot, as if driven mad. When he reached the Yunxia Sect martial artist, he opened his mouth to bite, shouting, “You want me dead? I’ll make you die first!”

“This person has been consumed by the demonic aura and has gone mad,” Di Mo’s voice echoed.

“How dare you!” The Yunxia Sect martial artist clearly had encountered such situations before. Without a word of inquiry, he drew his sword and stabbed it into the man’s chest, then kicked him off the ship.

The sound of a beast being torn apart echoed from below.

Everyone felt a chill in their hearts!

The Yunxia Sect martial artist coldly surveyed the ordinary people on the ship, barking, “Anyone who dares to act out will be thrown overboard to feed the fish!”

The killing intent was palpable, and his imposing presence made it so that no one dared to meet his gaze.

The ship fell silent.

The ship’s destination was not the distant horizon but the right peninsula of Yunxia Island, shrouded in mist. After making a large detour, the ship finally docked.

While on the ship, Yang Kai had already learned the purpose of their mission.

They were to pick a fruit called Black Mysterious Fruit from the island. Yang Kai recognized this fruit. Half a month after arriving at Yunxia Island, he had heard the Yunxia Sect disciple explain it. It was depicted on the first page of the booklet—a dark fruit that grew in bunches like grapes, a specialty of Yunxia Island, found only in the surrounding sea.

The disciple had emphasized the importance of the Black Mysterious Fruit several times during his explanation. At the time, Yang Kai did not understand why he was so focused on it, but now he finally grasped the reason.

The Yunxia Sect's primary goal in capturing ordinary people was to have them gather the Black Mysterious Fruit.

This fruit was of low grade, theoretically only classified as Common-Grade, but it was unclear what the Yunxia Sect intended to do with it.

Each person was assigned a herb basket, and they had to collect at least three pounds of Black Mysterious Fruit to complete their task. Naturally, if they could gather other precious herbs, they could offset their task based on their value.

This was also why the Yunxia Sect had spent half a month teaching these ordinary people about herbal knowledge, fearing they might encounter rare herbs and miss them due to ignorance.

Over a hundred ordinary people were driven off the ship, while the Yunxia Sect members remained on board, treating the right peninsula as a forbidden zone that no one dared to enter.

The True Yuan Realm expert declared, “You have three days. After three days, we will return to pick you up. If you fail to complete your task, you need not return; you can fend for yourselves!” 

The ship departed, leaving over a hundred ordinary people staring despondently.

The thirty or so people who had been captured with Yang Kai were still confused about the situation, while for the others it was clearly not the first time executing such a task.

After lingering for a moment, many silently shouldered their herb baskets and ventured deeper into the peninsula.

Gradually, the number of people remaining dwindled. Yang Kai stood by the shore, looking down, and sighed helplessly.

Beneath the surface of the sea, some aquatic demon beasts were swimming about, making escape impossible.

Turning around, Yang Kai also stepped into the right peninsula.

“Master, the demonic aura here is quite thick. No wonder the Yunxia Sect disciples do not dare to enter,” Di Mo transmitted.

If even a trace of this demonic aura were inhaled, it might not pose much harm to the body, but prolonged exposure could very well consume one’s mind and body, leading one down the path of demonic cultivation.

This was precisely why the Yunxia Sect needed to capture ordinary people to gather herbs in the right peninsula. Spending a month nurturing these ordinary people was also to ensure they could last a bit longer, preventing them from going mad the moment they entered the island.

“Don’t you enjoy the demonic aura?” Yang Kai teased, remaining unperturbed.

“Hehe, what you say is true, Master,” Di Mo cackled, “With this old servant here, you need not worry about being affected by the demonic aura. However, this place is ultimately a strange land. You might as well explore a bit; perhaps you will find some rewards.”

“That is my intention!” Yang Kai nodded. Having been captured on this isolated island for a month, although he was well-fed, he still wanted to collect some interest.

With the herb basket on his back, he ventured deeper into the right peninsula.

The outer areas were surely devoid of anything, and even if the Black Mysterious Fruit had a fast growth cycle, it could not withstand repeated harvesting. Only by going deeper could he hope to discover something.

Many shared Yang Kai’s thoughts. Numerous people traveled in pairs, with few going alone.

As time passed, Yang Kai gradually noticed that he could no longer see anyone nearby.

As he walked, Yang Kai suddenly spotted a figure ahead, rushing towards a certain spot. Following the direction he was running, Yang Kai saw a vine bearing a bunch of fruits resembling grapes.

Black Mysterious Fruit!

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up. He quickened his pace, arriving beneath the Black Mysterious Fruit first and reaching out to harvest it.

Weighing it in his hand, he estimated that this bunch weighed about half a pound, meaning he only needed to find six bunches to complete his task.

The other person also rushed over. Upon seeing Yang Kai, his expression shifted to one of shock, followed by a fierce glare as he growled, “Kid, give me the fruit!”

Yang Kai frowned and sighed.

This person had likely been a kind-hearted poor soul, but after entering this place, he had been influenced by the demonic aura and gradually lost his true nature. Now, he only exhibited ferocity and madness, as if he would kill Yang Kai if he did not hand over the bunch of Black Mysterious Fruit.

“I can give you the fruit,” Yang Kai replied, not wanting to fight over it with an ordinary person.

“Quickly give it to me!” The man lowered his head, glaring fiercely at Yang Kai.

“Answer me one question: What does the Yunxia Sect want this fruit for?” Yang Kai asked, realizing that this person was likely not his first time in this place and should have some knowledge.

“Stop wasting time! Hand over the fruit, and I’ll tell you,” the man insisted.

Yang Kai smiled and tossed the bunch of Black Mysterious Fruit over.

The man caught it, a smile appearing on his face as he placed the Black Mysterious Fruit into the herb basket on his back. He sized up Yang Kai, the ferocity in his eyes gradually fading. After a moment of contemplation, he finally spoke, “I don’t know much, but I’ve heard that they want this fruit to feed fish.”

“Feed fish?”

“Yeah, a special kind of fish. I’m not sure what it is specifically,” he replied.

After saying this, the man looked at Yang Kai with a peculiar, insidious gaze and added, “You look so thin and weak. Why not team up with me? It’s very dangerous here.”

Was he trying to recruit him? Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. He guessed that if he teamed up with this person, any Black Mysterious Fruit they found would surely have to satisfy his needs first.

“Unappreciative!” The man did not press Yang Kai further, finally showing that some humanity still remained within him. He snorted coldly and walked away.
