## Chapter 1409 — Why Is She Here?

"Your Junior Sister is not wrong." Gong Aofu snorted. "Young people who lay their sharpness bare invite trouble; a tree that stands out will be the first to be broken by the wind. If he does not temper his temperament, he will surely die young. I will not allow you to have any dealings with him, lest our Liuli Sect be dragged into trouble."

"Master!" Daiyuan cried out in alarm, about to say something, when Gong Aofu fixed her with a stern look and asked, "What, do you even refuse to heed your Master's words?"

Daiyuan bit her thin lip and after a long moment replied, "Disciple will strictly follow Master’s teachings."

Hearing that, Gong Aofu at last looked away, satisfied.

Nearby, two young women stood together, both gazing at Yang Kai with bright eyes; one wore a faintly coquettish mien, the other radiated pure, innocent charm. Both, however, furrowed their brows slightly, appearing worried.

Their power was not high—both were only at the Saint King Realm—and they stood among a crowd, so Yang Kai did not notice them. If he had, he would have recognized them as Shen Shitao and Lü Ying, Senior and Junior Sisters of Qiantian Sect.

Yang Kai had crossed paths with Shen Shitao several times; she had more than once invited him to join Qiantian Sect and take part in the sect’s trials, only to be politely declined by him.

It was thanks to them that Yang Kai had been able to chance upon Qian Yue in Black Crow City, redeem her, and bring her back to Dragon Lair Mountain.

As disciples of Qiantian Sect, the two had accompanied their master to Tianyun City for the auction. They had intended to visit Dragon Lair Mountain to check on Yang Kai, but had been tied up with trivial matters and never found the opportunity—only today did they follow their master to watch the commotion.

Seeing Dragon Lair Mountain in such peril, Shen Shitao and Lü Ying were secretly anxious.

Yang Kai had left them a good impression—he had even saved their lives in Zangxiong Valley—but their strength was weak. At a moment like this they had no voice in the matter.

"Senior Sister, this time his troubles seem serious," Lü Ying whispered.

"Mm." Shen Shitao nodded instinctively. Her gaze was farther-reaching than Lü Ying’s; she understood that if Dragon Lair Mountain could not handle this properly, the result could be irrevocable doom.

"So, what do you think? Can he survive this trial?" Lü Ying asked again.

"How would I know?" Shen Shitao forced a smile. If she had sufficient strength she would not hesitate to help, but she was only at the Saint King Realm and could offer no real assistance now. Biting her red lip, she mused, "Still, he’s always been lucky—perhaps heaven will favor him this time as well."

Though their voices were low, a middle-aged man ahead of them heard every word clearly. This man’s cultivation was impressive—on par with Qian Tong and the others at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—but his long hair was even glossier and more handsome than the women’s, reaching almost to his waist. Broad-shouldered and clad in a scholar’s robe, he carried an air of uninhibited flamboyance.

He turned and smiled gently, beckoning to Shen Shitao and Lü Ying.

The two exchanged a glance and hurried forward, bowing respectfully. "Master!"

The man was none other than Mo Yu, Great Elder of Qiantian Sect, a renowned figure on Dark Star whose reputation matched that of Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu. Shen Shitao and Lü Ying would not normally have qualified to become his disciples, but during the Flowing Flame Sandland they had accomplished great deeds and brought countless Saint Crystals back to the sect, so Mo Yu had made an exception and taken them under his wing, giving them guidance and enabling their rapid growth.

The defensive Secret Treasure Shen Shitao had used in Zangxiong Valley—the Nine Palace Sky-Net Umbrella—had been bestowed upon her by him.

"Do you know this youth?" Mo Yu asked with a kindly expression.

Shen Shitao and Lü Ying exchanged a glance; they dared not lie to their master. Shen Shitao replied, "Yes, Master. He is the friend of whom I once spoke, the one who has been quite fortunate."

"Oh? The one who carries great fortune?" Mo Yu raised an eyebrow, showing interest.

"Yes, that’s him."

“Heh heh, now this is rather interesting. The so-called matter of fortune and destiny is nothing but something illusory and fleeting. A person’s luck will rise and fall—it can’t remain good forever. As the saying goes, when misfortune reaches its limit, prosperity follows. That is the principle.” Mo Yu seemed to be speaking to himself, yet also as if imparting a lesson to Shen Shitao, who did not dare to interrupt and could only listen respectfully.

Mo Yu glanced at her and chuckled, "Are you hoping I will put in a good word for him?"

Shen Shitao’s delicate body trembled as she hurriedly said, “This disciple wouldn’t dare. Though I am a woman, I still know the weight of matters—I would never dare let Master wade into such muddy waters.”

"Good, you are sensible." Mo Yu nodded slightly. "The situation is unclear now; this old man would not lightly step into such affairs."

He seemed middle-aged but was in fact quite old; calling himself ‘old man’ was not inappropriate. Then he laughed softly and added, "Still, I am curious how fortunate he truly is that you would praise him so. If he can weather this peril, I will believe him truly blessed with great fortune—and afterward you may interact with him more often."

Shen Shitao’s face lit up, though the present dire circumstances soon clouded her features with worry.

After all, Yang Kai had once saved her. Now being helpless to intervene left her uneasy and ashamed.

"But if he cannot get past this trial… well, if he cannot, then there will be no later. Sit back and watch the show with me," Mo Yu chuckled.

Shen Shitao and Lü Ying exchanged glances and could only stand aside and watch.

Within Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai stood behind the Protective Mountain Array and clasped his fists slightly. Elders, you honor me with your presence today. By right, this Junior should invite you all into the mountain as guests. However, our mountain has just endured a great battle, and there are still many matters that require my attention. I must beg your forgiveness for my lack of hospitality—please, Elders, take your leave for now!”

He did not wish to bicker with these people any longer; naturally he intended to send them away.

Everyone understood his meaning, but no one made a move—especially Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng, whose eyes looked at Yang Kai as if they would devour him. Were it not for the presence of Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, a fight would have likely broken out.

However, it was impossible for them to just leave like this. Both sects had suffered heavy losses; if they departed empty-handed, how would they save face? Yang Kai understood this, but he would at least state his stance. If they disregarded everything and attacked, he would have the moral high ground and Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu could step in to mediate, avoiding undue harm to Yingyue Hall.

Seeing no one leave, Yang Kai sneered and declared loudly, "What? Have you Elders, like the Xie Family, set your sights on claiming this little mountain of mine?"

"Brat, don’t talk nonsense. Since we have come, shouldn’t you, as the junior, invite us in to rest? That is the proper way to receive guests." Jin Shi snorted coldly.

Several experts nodded slightly at his words.

Though these strong ones had no grudge with Yang Kai or Dragon Lair Mountain and had come merely for spectacle, learning of the mountain’s peculiar formations and suppressive arrays stirred their curiosity to step inside.

Thus even if they suspected Jin Shi had ulterior motives, they still agreed with him.

Once inside Dragon Lair Mountain, could Yang Kai truly stop them from examining the arrays and restrictions? Would they care whether their prying brought calamity upon the mountain?

"Old Jin, have you no shame? He already made it clear there are pressing matters here and apologized in advance for the lack of hospitality. Are you trying to bully the weak? If you want to rest, fifty li away is Tianyun City. Come with me and I will host you there." Qian Tong glared at Jin Shi in displeasure.

After all, this was Yingyue Hall’s territory; to deny Yang Kai face was to show contempt for Yingyue Hall, which angered Qian Tong.

"Of course we'll go to Tianyun City, but this brat’s arrogance insults us. He does not seem to regard us at all," Jin Shi looked as if he would not let it go.

"Don’t use this as an excuse. If you want trouble, I’ll deal with you!" Qian Tong growled, his expression souring.

Seeing Qian Tong’s determination, Jin Shi frowned. He did not quite understand the relationship between Qian Tong and Yang Kai that would make Qian Tong risk offending him to stand up for the youth. Continuing to press the matter would surely make things worse.

Yet walking away was also inappropriate.

Jin Shi glanced toward Old Woman Feng, whose face was dark and eyes murderous as she stared at Yang Kai. Just as he thought to drag her into the dispute, a staggering Heavenly Might rolled in from afar, sweeping closer.

Jin Shi’s expression changed and the words on his lips died; he suddenly turned his head.

Others did the same.

The assembled experts numbered from about a dozen to twenty at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, but even with their might they felt the newcomer was not to be trifled with and their faces showed alarm.

Only Yan Pei, the old black-faced one, showed a trace of astonishment and murmured, "Why is she here?"

It was as if the arrival of this person was wholly unexpected.

A streak of cyan light rushed in from the distance. Moments later it flashed and stopped about a dozen zhang in front of the crowd, then the light dissipated to reveal two figures.

A man and a woman.

The woman led them—clad in an emerald palace robe, her long hair pinned up at the nape, revealing a long, fair neck. She bore an imperial bearing and a pair of phoenix-like eyes that seemed born to issue commands, so that no one dared to meet her gaze too long.

She looked to be in her thirties or forties, a beauty despite her age—skin as white and smooth as if flawless, fingers delicate and figure alluring—yet at this moment no one dared belittle her for a single moment, for the aura she exuded made all faces change.

That aura outstripped even that of an ordinary Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.
