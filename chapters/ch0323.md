## Chapter 323 — Young Master Yang Has No Taste for Women

With a sneer, Yang Kai directly pinned Bilo down, his hands indiscriminately covering her perky breasts.

The heat and amazing elasticity from her body ignited Yang Kai in an instant, causing his blood to boil and a fierce heat in his lower abdomen.

Speaking of which, it had been an eternity since he last dual-cultivated with Su Yan…

During this time, he had endured countless temptations of beauty, managing to hold back at each critical moment. However, over time, the seeds of desire had long been buried. Bilo's use of alluring arts on this occasion undoubtedly ignited that spark completely.

“Hey, what… what are you doing?” Bilo exclaimed in shock, frantically pushing Yang Kai away. Yet, after being affected by the backlash of the alluring arts, she was powerless, and with Yang Kai's caresses, her delicate body grew even softer, unable to push away the heavy body pressing down on her.

The scorching aura surged toward her, making her heart tremble, almost engulfing her consciousness.

With a tearing sound, the fabric of her clothing was rent asunder, the noise strikingly harsh. Bilo felt a sudden chill as her red garments were torn open, leaving a significant portion of her snow-white skin exposed to the air.

“You scoundrel!” Bilo cursed through gritted teeth, her eyes filled with both fear and confusion as she pounded her fists against Yang Kai’s shoulders.

“Oh…” In the midst of her struggles, a wave of delightful sensation coursed through her chest, as if an electric current had surged past, causing a strange tone to escape Bilo’s lips. The sound only served to deepen her embarrassment.

Looking down, she saw that the detestable man was kissing the crimson skin of her chest, his hands in constant, inappropriate motion, rubbing between her waist and thighs. Each caress brought dizzying shocks.

“Don’t…” Bilo softly protested, though the strength in her hands gradually waned. It seemed she no longer wished to push him away. Her entire body tensed up, a finger sucking upon her lips, emitting soft moans as she ceased to resist, instead fully enjoying the pleasure that accompanied Yang Kai. Her beautiful eyes grew hazy, beads of sweat glistening on her snowy skin, reflecting a faint rosy glow, unconsciously acquiescing to Yang Kai's advances, yearning for further delight.

Yang Kai was utterly dumbfounded.

He initially only wanted to teach Bilo a lesson. Although this lesson might seem excessive for a woman, it should depend on the person.

Since Bilo practiced alluring arts, she naturally would not be a stranger to matters between men and women. Such a lesson would ensure she never forgets. It might even prevent her from plotting against him in the future.

Never did he expect that the enchanting girl would last so little before ceasing her resistance, not only compromising but also cooperating quite enthusiastically.

This was undoubtedly exhilarating news.

Realizing this, Yang Kai hesitated no further. In one fluid motion, their clothing was shed.

As he mounted her, Bilo suddenly came to her senses and hurriedly stopped Yang Kai, her face pale with fear. “No, no, no… you can’t do this.”

“Are you joking?” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes at her. At this point, was he supposed to hold back?

“If you really can’t help it, I can call Sister Yunli over. If that doesn’t work, Ruoyu and Ruoqing can come too. They were sent by the elders to serve you. No matter how you treat them, they won’t resist,” Bilo said anxiously, her face a mask of pleading. “What do you think? I can bring all three of them in.”

“No need for that; it’s just you.” 

Bilo wore a troubled expression, her cheeks flushed as she secretly glanced at Yang Kai's imposing form, letting out a gasp of surprise, seemingly greatly frightened.

Suddenly feeling shy, she avoided Yang Kai’s fiery gaze and boldly whispered, “Do you want to try something different…”

“What?” Yang Kai asked, befuddled.

“Just… just that,” Bilo said through clenched teeth, whispering softly.

“What?” Yang Kai was utterly confused.

Bilo rolled her eyes in exasperation, tugging at Yang Kai’s ear, pulling his head down, and quietly whispered a few words in his ear. After finishing, her immaculate skin became even more enticing, her captivating eyes unfocused.

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment before suddenly realizing, staring at Bilo with astonishment. “Is that also possible?”

“Mm.” Bilo gently nodded.

“How do you know this?” Yang Kai felt a blow to his ego, suddenly feeling as pure as a blank sheet of paper in front of Bilo.

“I practice alluring arts, and all this… was taught to me by the elders.”

What Yang Kai did not know was that due to cultivating alluring arts, Shan Qingluo had specifically assigned two young women to assist Bilo, which was why Bilo had developed certain preferences after enduring intimate contact with them for an extended period.

“Do you want to…?” Seeing Yang Kai standing there in a daze, Bilo couldn’t help but let out a soft whimper, covering her face as she pressed on.

Although she usually acted recklessly, deep down, she was still a girl, and at this moment, she felt a rush of embarrassment.

“Alright!” Yang Kai was thoroughly excited.

“Let me be clear; don’t harm my body; everything else is up to you…” Bilo added, blushing, before flipping over, pinning Yang Kai down, and smiling seductively as she lowered her head.

An overwhelming shout soon erupted, mingled with rich sounds of moans.

Outside Fenghuan Tower.

The lovely woman Yunli and the others, Ruoyu and Ruoqing, were cleaning fallen leaves when faint footsteps approached from a distance.

Yunli looked up and recognized two unfamiliar women coming into view.

Strangers rarely appeared in the palace. Although Yunli had not seen these two, she quickly deduced who they were.

They were probably the two girls the elder had brought back a few days ago, one named Qiu Yimeng and the other Luo Xiaoman.

Their true essences were sealed, and they had subsequently been confined within Yingxiang Tower.

Perhaps due to good behavior, they had been allowed to wander the palace in recent days.

They were likely connected in some way to the young master practicing in a trance within Fenghuan Tower.

With this thought, Yunli approached them with a radiant smile and remarked, “You two must be Miss Qiu and Miss Luo?”

Qiu Yimeng examined the lovely woman before her, her beautiful eyes flickering with surprise, not expecting any woman in Shan Qingluo’s palace to be so outstandingly beautiful.

She nodded slightly, saying, “Yes, how should I address you, sister?”

Yunli chuckled lightly. “Miss Qiu, don’t flatter me; just call me Yunli.”

Yunli was well aware of Qiu Yimeng's distinguished status. Although she was only a monitored prisoner at present, her noble lineage meant that she wouldn’t genuinely allow her to call her ‘sister’ to gain an advantage.

Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly, not engaging in further conversation.

Yunli smiled as she inquired, “You two are here to see Young Master Yang, right?”

“Mm. I heard from someone in the palace that he resides here, so I came looking for him. I have some matters to discuss; I wonder if he’s available now?”

“Right now…” Yunli glanced back at the second floor of Fenghuan Tower, lightly smiling as she answered, “He should be available; Young Master Yang usually takes a rest around this time.”

“Rest?” Qiu Yimeng showed surprise, “Is he usually very busy?”

“Oh, ever since Young Master Yang arrived here, he’s been cultivating non-stop.”

Qiu Yimeng was momentarily taken aback, unable to suppress a wry smile.

Even though she and Luo Xiaoman worked diligently at their cultivation, they wouldn’t be constantly practicing. Hearing that Yang Kai had remained diligent here made her admire his perseverance.

“You can follow me; since you are old acquaintances of Young Master Yang, he should be willing to meet you,” Yunli smiled, putting down the broom in her hands. Saying a quick word to Ruoyu and Ruoqing, she led Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman inside.

As they assessed their surroundings, Qiu Yimeng’s expression grew increasingly bitter, while Luo Xiaoman was furious, whispering to Qiu Yimeng, “The young scoundrel lives in such a nice place! It’s full of flowers and fragrant plants, and the view is exceptionally broad.”

In contrast, their own residence in Yingxiang Tower, despite having 'fragrance' in its name, bore no flowers or plants, situated in a remote, dark corner, resembling a prison cell, utterly incomparable to the splendid Fenghuan Tower.

“And it’s even a separate pavilion, attended by three servant girls!” Luo Xiaoman’s anger grew as she spoke. Why was it that after being confined, Yang Kai was treated so well?

In terms of status, didn’t they both surpass him by a fair margin?

“Wow, and there’s a bathing pool!” Upon entering Fenghuan Tower, Luo Xiaoman became even more agitated, gazing enviously at the enormous bathing pool. Pathetically, she added, “Sister Qiu, I really want to take a bath here; I haven’t washed since coming here and I’m dying from the itching.”

At her mention, even Qiu Yimeng felt uncomfortable, gently scolding, “Xiao Man!”

“You brat!” Luo Xiaoman murmured displeasedly.

Yunli, who was leading the way, suddenly turned back, grinning, “Young Master Yang is actually a good person; you may have misunderstood him. I’ll mention this to him, and he should let you both bathe here.”

“I wouldn’t want that; what if he becomes overly lustful…” Luo Xiaoman exclaimed in alarm.

Yunli smiled gently, “That won’t happen; Young Master Yang truly has no taste for women.”

As she spoke, a blush crept onto her cheeks as she continued, “I and Ruoyu and Ruoqing are sent by the elders to serve the young master, but throughout all this time, he has treated us with great respect and has never crossed any lines, even though he could easily do so, so you need not worry about anything.”

“He’s that great?” Qiu Yimeng's eyes sparkled with an unusual light, seemingly surprised that Yang Kai could remain unaffected by beauty, choosing to focus on his cultivation instead.

In that case, this man truly had some depth. At the very least, his willpower, composure, and aptitude were commendable.

If she could recruit him into the Qiu family and provide him with cultivation resources, he would likely achieve great accomplishments in the future!

Lost in thought, Qiu Yimeng sighed; she still had no idea when she might gain her freedom again. Contemplating these things was indeed too early.

However, if she could regain her freedom, she would definitely strive to pull him into the Qiu family, as such a young talent was rare. She silently resolved in her heart.

As they spoke, they quickly reached the second floor.

Yunli softly said, “Young Master Yang is inside. Please wait a moment; I’ll inform him.”

“Thank you!” Qiu Yimeng nodded gently.
