## Chapter 474 — My Surname Is Di

After those five groups of people retreated a few steps, a strange, sinister laughter echoed over. The chilling sound caused everyone’s scalp to tingle painfully, extremely uncomfortable.

“Old man… did I let you leave?” The middle-aged man’s eyes flickered with dangerous cold light, his voice low and sinister. A grim aura spread outward, making everyone shiver uncontrollably.

Everyone’s expression changed drastically, turning extremely ugly. They no longer dared to act rashly.

“Sir, do you have further instructions?” The person who had spoken earlier frowned and asked, subtly accelerating his strength.

“Originally, I was in a good mood today and too lazy to start a massacre.” The middle-aged man leisurely smiled, a look of ease written all over his face. “But you people are shortsighted and foolish, siding with those you shouldn’t ally with, opposing those you shouldn’t oppose. In that case, I cannot sit idly by.”

Hearing the meaning behind his words, the faces of the five groups grew even uglier. The Divine Roaming Realm expert among them snorted coldly: “Our actions require no comment from you. Though your strength is formidable, with so many of us here, do you truly intend to pursue a complete extermination?”

As he spoke, the five groups gradually gathered together, their expressions solemn as they stared at the middle-aged man, revealing an attitude of mutual support through life and death.

Faced with such a powerful adversary, they had no choice but to hope the other party would show mercy and know when to retreat.

Unexpectedly, the middle-aged man didn’t find it troublesome at all. On the contrary, his expression grew even more excited and savage as he nodded repeatedly: “Not bad, not bad. So many of you—finally, a proper fight!”

As he spoke, his gaze turned fierce. He spread both hands wide, raised them slowly, and grinned menacingly: “Blood Sea Seals the Heavens!”

Suddenly, a flash of blood-light appeared behind him. The bright crimson blood sped toward the gathering point of the five groups like a released arrow.

None of them reacted in time and were caught off guard, fully enveloped by the blood-light.

What they saw was a world stained red, the sky turned an eye-piercing scarlet. The ground beneath their feet seemed soaked in fresh blood, constantly bubbling over basin-sized blisters that burst open, splattering blood onto each and every one of them, creating a terrifying scene.

Sounds of skin burning and flesh tearing were incessant.

It was like a Shura’s hell!

“What is this?” The five groups panicked. They had never seen such a sinister and eerie martial skill. Just one move had altered the very environment around them. In chaos, they all activated their True Yuan, fleeing through body techniques and using their treasures, trying to escape the blood-red realm’s grip.

Yet the blood on the ground seemed to have an enormous suction force, pinning them firmly in place. They could not budge.

The ground beneath them felt like swampy land; the more they struggled, the faster they sank.

“Ke ke ke ke…” The middle-aged man laughed again, a look of joy on his face as he watched their clumsy, helpless struggles in the Blood Sea. His narrow eyes even emitted a strange light, clearly excited and utterly exhilarated.

The people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect were equally stunned, all turning their eyes toward the Blood Sea, their pupils shaking violently.

Everyone knew this mysterious middle-aged man was powerful, yet no one expected him to be this strong.

With a single move, he had trapped five entire groups in a deadly predicament. Judging by his demeanor, it seemed he had barely exerted himself, simply striking out casually.

Ghost King Valley itself was an evil sect, its cultivation methods and martial skills dark and sinister. Yet even when Leng Shan and others compared their sect’s martial skills to this scene, it felt like a mere drop in the ocean. Looking at the sea of blood, all disciples of Ghost King Valley felt their bodies turn icy cold and their souls tremble.

The artifact refiners from Baoqi Sect turned pale; only Wu Yan forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart, casting a subtle glance at the middle-aged man.

He suddenly realized this middle-aged man was no good!

In less than ten breaths, those trapped in the Blood Sea began to change. Regardless of their strength or cultivation, all of them took on ferocious and grotesque expressions. Blood vessels burst from their eyes, which widened terrorfully. Panic vanished from their faces, replaced by boundless madness and a murderous aura.

It seemed the hidden brutality and evil within the Blood Sea had influenced their true hearts.

“Kill!” one roared furiously, his martial skill and treasure light enveloping a nearby comrade, reducing the man to a headless corpse.

Kill, kill, kill!

The five groups all seemed possessed, renouncing kinship, shouting madly as they fought to the death with those around them.

One corpse after another fell, the flowing blood making the Blood Sea even more vividly red.

The stench of blood rose to the sky.

The middle-aged man watched this epic spectacle, joy radiating from his brows and eyes.

Limbs and flesh flew wildly, bodies piled sky-high, rivers of blood flowed.

Several female disciples from Baoqi Sect and Ghost King Valley couldn’t help but take out their handkerchiefs and rush aside to gag, vomiting until their stomachs were empty.

They had never witnessed such a bloody, horrifying sight; it greatly exceeded their mental limits.

The middle-aged man glanced at them, chuckled lowly, then ignored them.

In about half a tea session’s time, almost all of the five groups trapped in the Blood Sea were dead, leaving only the Divine Roaming Realm expert who had spoken earlier still barely clinging to life.

He was the strongest among them, though only at Divine Roaming Realm Sixth Stage, his individual cultivation and martial skill were far more refined than others.

But even if he survived, he was no longer himself.

His eyes were an intense red, like a beast trapped in a cage for thousands of years, unable to break free. Hot air spewed from his nostrils, a killing intent darkening his face as he scanned left and right, standing alone on the Blood Sea.

His mind was annihilated. He was now a corpse following only the instinct to kill.

“Good! You survived, then I’ll spare you!” The middle-aged man laughed heartily, clapping his hands. As he waved, a series of profound and mysterious Seals were cast at the Divine Roaming Realm expert’s body.

With the Seals, the Divine Roaming Realm expert’s body transformed into a vortex, crazily devouring the nearby blood.

This bizarre scene impressed the people from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect once again.

As blood flowed into him, his body and face gradually changed. His body grew larger and larger with each circle, his face contorted horribly, and a large bump even protruded from his forehead.

After some time, the blood was completely absorbed, and looking at him now, one could barely discern his original appearance.

This Divine Roaming Realm expert was blood-red like a scorching hot iron rod. His face was blurred, only his eyes emitted a chilling light.

Wu Yan was shocked by the middle-aged man’s strange method. After a brief scan, he realized this originally Sixth Stage Divine Roaming Realm martial artist now radiated an astounding True Yuan fluctuation, and his aura had turned wild, brutal, bloodthirsty, and cruel.

“Roar!” The man howled wildly to the heavens, a beast-like roar escaping his lips. The wind and clouds above changed color; a massive cloud thickened overhead, and a red light shot from the bump on his forehead, breaking through the sky.

“Still useful, not wasted my nurturing you with blood!” The middle-aged man snorted lightly, spreading his hand. The Divine Roaming Realm expert suddenly transformed into a blood light, rushing toward him and vanishing into his palm.

Everyone was stunned.

The middle-aged man’s continuous techniques were unheard of and unseen before. They seemed completely alien to this world.

Having witnessed his ruthlessness and brutality, those from Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect felt a bitter chill in their hearts and a deep sorrow, as if escaping one wolf’s den only to fall into a tiger’s lair.

He killed those five groups as easily as crushing ants. Would he hesitate blinking at killing them?

Unexpectedly, after absorbing the blood light, his fierce expression melted away, replaced by a gentle smile as he descended to the ground, looking at everyone and saying, “Well, the trash is cleared. Let’s depart.”

No one dared move; all stared at him with a mixture of fear and caution.

“Hm?” The middle-aged man sensed the atmosphere was off and laughed in surprise, “Afraid I’ll kill you?”

Wu Yan awkwardly cleared his throat and hastily said, “No, sir. You saved our lives; we dare not make presumptions.”

“Rest assured, since you’re here to help Yang Kai, I won’t harm you. I’m going to find Yang Kai as well, hehe!” The middle-aged man’s expression was gentle, immediately relaxing many faces. Then he changed tone and chuckled, “But if you’re helping other scions of the Yang Family, don’t blame me for being merciless.”

The relaxed atmosphere froze once more.

Wu Yan quickly said, “No, no, we’re precisely here to join Young Master Kai.”

But inwardly, he harbored doubts—what kind of people was the youngest Yang Family scion befriending? Could this man be the notorious Evil Lord?

Among the crowd, Leng Shan hesitated for some time before summoning courage to approach, gazing at the middle-aged man and softly asking, “Thank you, Senior, for your rescue just now. Might I ask your name?”

Wu Yan’s ears twitched as he suppressed his breath, keenly listening.

“I am called Di… yes, my surname is Di,” the man replied.

“Ah, so it’s Senior Di.” Leng Shan dared not pry deeper, but her beautiful eyes narrowed suspiciously. “Senior Di, have we met before somewhere?”

Shen Yi and Cheng Ying were shocked and quickly gestured to Leng Shan not to engage further.

This middle-aged man obviously was trouble, with merciless methods far crueler than Ghost King Valley’s. Her Junior Sister was clearly insane for wanting to get close—she should have fled instead!

Unexpectedly, the man surnamed Di smiled faintly and nodded: “Indeed, we have met.”

Leng Shan was even more confused, frowning as a puzzled look crossed her delicate face: “Then why do I have no impression at all? I only vaguely feel you seem familiar.”
