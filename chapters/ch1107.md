## Chapter 1107 — Business

When he had originally gone with Guiche and the others, they had slain many Seventh-Tier and Eighth-Tier demonic beasts, and naturally obtained a fair amount of materials; the useless materials from last time hadn't all been taken, but now they were finally cleared out.

If Yang Yan continued to perform to his satisfaction, Yang Kai decided he would have her help him forge an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure.

Looking at the floor strewn with materials taken from demonic beasts' bodies, Yang Yan hesitated for a long while before finally relenting.

Isn't it only thirty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals? She figured she'd have plenty of days to make that much!

After putting all the materials into her Spatial Ring, Yang Yan produced another list and handed it to Yang Kai: "Go buy these ores for me; I need to rest a few days, then I can begin forging."

Yang Kai took it, didn't bother to look at what ores she wanted, nodded, and was about to leave.

Cautiously from behind, Yang Yan asked, "May I recover in your stone chamber? Your Spiritual Qi is somewhat richer here."

"You may!"

Leaving Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai flew straight for Tianyun City.

Following the list provided by Yang Yan, it took only half a day to purchase all the ores on it. Yang Yan seemed to know exactly what kinds of ores could be found in Tianyun City, so every item on the list was available there—there was no need to worry about sourcing materials.

While he was checking quantities and quality with the shop's clerk who sold the ores, a smiling, portly old man walked over, looked Yang Kai up and down with interest, and gently asked, "Young Brother, buying so many ores—are you going to forge?"

Yang Kai frowned and glanced at him; the clerk immediately introduced, "Sir, this is our shop's proprietor, Qian Tong!"

Yang Kai gave a faint nod without speaking. The Fat Elder looked harmless enough, but his strength was far from ordinary—he was likely an expert of the Origin Returning Realm. His aura was deeply restrained. Yang Kai wasn’t sure what the old man had perceived, but at a time like this, it was best to say as little as possible.

Qian Tong paid no mind and smiled: "Young brother, rest assured—our shop's prices are fair, we cheat neither young nor old, and we would never engage in rotten business. Yes, we also purchase Secret Treasures; if you have any to sell, we can sit down and talk—the price will surely satisfy you."

"How do you know I have Secret Treasures to sell?" Yang Kai looked at him again, greatly puzzled.

Qian Tong laughed: "Guests are welcome; I say the same to every guest."

"I do, in fact, have Secret Treasures to sell," Yang Kai said with a laugh.

This trip to Tianyun City was partly to buy the ores on Yang Yan's list, and partly to sell the Secret Treasures that woman had forged—keeping them did him no good. Whether it was the wolf-tooth club, the dagger, or the soft whip, none of them suited his use; leaving them in his Spatial Ring was mere hoarding—better to exchange them for Saint Crystals.

Buying those ores had indeed cost him quite a few Saint Crystals.

He had intended to ask Wu Yi to help offload those Secret Treasures, since he wasn't familiar with the market here. But Wu Yi's own situation wasn't good—low in strength and rank—asking her might bring unnecessary trouble.

Now this smiling, portly old man had come to seek him out—exactly how Yang Kai liked it.

The man's strength was not weak, but Yang Kai did not fear him. At worst he could tear open space and flee—having means to save his life naturally gave him leverage in negotiations.

"Oh? Then this old man's eye isn't so bad, haha—this way, Young Brother!" Qian Tong gestured and led Yang Kai aside.

Before long they reached a sealed chamber; it was clearly used for private deals. Many who sell things dislike being seen, and prefer that strangers not see what they sell—so masked customers often come to such shops to trade.

This sealed room neatly avoided such problems—the door closed and only Yang Kai and Qian Tong remained inside; even Divine Sense seemed blocked, unable to probe.

Yang Kai glanced around calmly, his expression unchanged and composed.

A flicker of sharpness passed through the smile in Qian Tong's eyes; he was secretly startled, unable to tell whether this youth was thick-skinned or genuinely unafraid.

He was a businessman; surprised though he was, he did not pry and asked, "May I ask what sort of Secret Treasures you wish to sell, and of what grade?"

Yang Kai produced the three items Yang Yan had forged.

Qian Tong glanced, picked up the three Secret Treasures and examined them one by one. After a moment he nodded: "Although I'm not versed in forging, I can see these three are top-grade for their rank, likely crafted by the same smith. What price do you seek, Young Brother?"

Qian Tong stuck to business and didn't pry into miscellaneous details, which pleased Yang Kai.

"I'm not familiar with prices—how do you usually purchase?" Yang Kai countered.

Qian Tong was taken aback; he hadn't expected Yang Kai to cede the initiative. Those who come to sell always clutch the reins—afraid of underselling, they'd shamelessly praise their wares and scheme to raise the price.

Even after a deal, many privately rued whether they'd undersold.

This youth was unusually unconcerned, apparently indifferent to whether he lost out.

Smiling, Qian Tong said, "Saint King-Grade Secret Treasures generally start at five thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals, though there's no real cap. Of your three items, two are Saint King-Grade Lower-Level and one is Saint King-Grade Middle-Level—quite well forged. I'll offer six thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals for each of the two Lower-Level pieces, and eight thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals for the Middle-Level one. How's that?"

"Twenty thousand in total?" Yang Kai frowned; the price was a little lower than he'd imagined.

But then he recalled that Saint Crystals on Dark Star fetched higher value than elsewhere, and he relaxed—Qian Tong's offer was reasonable, and as a businessman he naturally had to make a profit.

"If you feel the price is low we can negotiate—business is about starting high and settling at the end," Qian Tong said with a faint smile.

"Give me those ores outside and the deal's done," Yang Kai said, pointing toward the exterior.

Qian Tong laughed in surprise: "You're clever, Young Brother—those ores you bought cost quite a sum, over three thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals… All right, consider it me making a friend. If in future you have Secret Treasures to sell, please give our shop priority."

"Done!" Yang Kai nodded.

The shop was quick; Yang Kai left the three Secret Treasures and soon received twenty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals and all the ores he needed, then departed Tianyun City directly.

After he left, Qian Tong smiled and watched his departing back: "Interesting."

"Elder Qian…we lost on that deal—giving him ores worth over three thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals leaves us little profit," the clerk who had served Yang Kai came over to complain.

Qian Tong chuckled: "Is that so? I actually think we made quite a bit."

The clerk looked baffled, counting on his fingers and still feeling it didn't add up.

"You know what? That kid must have a powerful smith behind him. He bought ores before too, though not here—by chance I was in that other shop so I remember him. He's clever enough to switch shops to buy ores, yet most of Tianyun City's shops belong to my Yingyue Hall. Within barely a month… he's back buying ores and brought three Saint King-Grade Secret Treasures. What do you think that means?" Qian Tong was in a good mood and chatted a little, laughing heartily at the clerk's puzzled look.

"He'll come again; if he does, notify me at once. If you can't reach me, make the deal with him—even if it means taking a loss. The important thing is to keep him satisfied," Qian Tong instructed.

"Understood, Elder," the clerk hurriedly replied; though he didn't know exactly what Elder Qian meant, following his orders was never wrong.

Qian Tong immediately left the shop and went to a palace in Tianyun City, where he found another very elderly man and handed over the three Secret Treasures.

The very elderly man gently stroked the Secret Treasures, his eyes closed as if sensing something. After a moment his expression changed and he looked surprised.

A full half-hour later the very elderly man set the three Secret Treasures down and opened his eyes.

"Master Gelin, what did you discern?" Qian Tong asked at once.

"These three Secret Treasures were forged by an Origin-Grade smith!" the elder called Gelin breathed in deeply.

"Origin-Grade…" Qian Tong's eyes widened at once. Though he'd inferred a capable smith behind Yang Kai from various signs, he hadn't expected it to be an Origin-Grade.

"Yes, Origin-Grade—his ability rivals my own. The materials used are almost entirely parts from Eighth-Tier demonic beasts. Who forged these? Is there such a person near Tianyun City?" Gelin asked curiously.

"I don't know who forged them; today they were brought by a young man to sell," Qian Tong shook his head.

"Have you traced his movements?" Gelin asked.

"We didn't act rashly; we won't risk offending whoever's behind him—it's not worth the loss."

Gelin nodded: "Yes, indeed—such people must be drawn in, not offended! Being able to slay Eighth-Tier demonic beasts shows he's no weakling; to both fight and forge makes him far stronger than I. Keep a close eye on that youth—if you show enough sincerity, it shouldn't be hard to learn the identity of the person behind him."

"That's my thought as well, and he should return. Today he bought many Saint King-Grade ores—likely to be used for forging Secret Treasures," Qian Tong said.

“Not bad. I’m getting old—probably won’t live for many more years. If that person can take my place by then, there’ll still be someone to repair your Secret Treasures when they’re damaged.” Grin gave a bitter smile. Artifact Refiners didn’t focus on cultivation or combat, so their vitality was not strong; their lifespans were generally much shorter than those of martial artists of the same realm.
