## Chapter 5 — Indomitable Golden Body

The meaning of those thirty-two characters was easy enough to understand; Yang Kai read them without trouble.

But the Black Book’s origin was unclear, and that made Yang Kai uneasy. What if it was some kind of trap? Still, he chuckled at himself—he was only a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion; who would go to the trouble of targeting someone like him?

Yet judging from the literal wording in the following lines, the reason the Black Stone Pillow transformed into the Black Book was likely tied to the change in his own dream today.

He had lain on that pillow for over a year without anything happening; only today did it become the Black Book, and that change could hardly be separated from the shift in his state of mind during the dream.

It was precisely because of his transformation that the Black Stone Pillow altered.

If he had brought the Black Book into being, then the Black Book was born for him—he was its master!

With that thought, Yang Kai no longer hesitated. The inscription clearly required him to use his own blood as a catalyst. Bearing a try-it-out attitude, he bit his palm hard and pressed his finger to the first page of the Black Book.

Blood dripped down, and at first nothing happened. As time passed, however, layers of black light began to ripple across the page. Yang Kai’s constitution was poor to begin with, and having been injured earlier that day, the ordeal left him feeling faint and dizzy.

But he gritted his teeth and endured; his blood continued to flow, and the glow on the page grew ever brighter.

After the span of a tea break, Yang Kai nearly fainted to the floor before the page showed a substantive change: the black radiance writhed and constricted, and a small vortex appeared in the center of the sheet.

Then a streak of golden light flashed within the vortex. Yang Kai fought to keep his wits and stared intently at the phenomenon.

From the black vortex something bright and rounded, shining with golden light, slowly rose up.

Yang Kai was stunned—there really was something on the page. Although he had felt some hope when he decided to bleed for the ritual, he had never expected it to truly succeed.

Yet everything before him proved the thirty-two characters on the page were no lie.

With blood as the guide, the Golden Body descends!

What sort of Golden Body would it be? Yang Kai’s pale face brimmed with anticipation.

A moment later, when the bright, rounded object fully revealed itself, Yang Kai swallowed hard; no matter how vivid his imagination, he had not pictured a Golden Body like this.

It was a golden skeleton roughly half a chi tall, the first thing to emerge being its gleaming skull. The little skeleton hovered above the Black Book’s page in a cross‑legged meditation pose. Every bone shone with golden light, bathing Yang Kai’s small hut in resplendent brilliance.

The black vortex on the page slowly faded until everything returned to calm.

Yang Kai stared at the bizarre golden skeleton, uncertain how to proceed. The page had only explained how to summon the Golden Body—not what to do after it appeared.

The more he looked, the more uneasy he felt. Although the skeleton clearly had no eyes, Yang Kai felt as if it were appraising him; it had no mouth, yet it seemed to be mocking his weakness.

Sensing that, Yang Kai flew into a rage and lunged to seize the golden skeleton.

How dare such a tiny skeleton act so arrogant!

But the moment he moved, the golden skeleton hurtled toward him, passing straight through his hand and embedding itself into his chest.

It was a grotesque sight—a skeleton collided with him, then a surge of golden light erupted as the skeleton dissolved into motes of glow that seeped into Yang Kai’s body through every pore.

In an instant he was wracked with pain—not ordinary pain, but a torment that seemed to originate from the marrow of his bones. Yang Kai cried out and collapsed, curling into a shriveled shape as convulsions racked him.

It felt as if every bone in his body shattered at once; Yang Kai couldn’t summon the strength to move a finger. This was no illusion—were he able to peer inward, he would see his bones truly broken to pieces, and around each fractured fragment a layer of golden light worked to mend it. But the repair could not keep pace with the destruction: just as a bone was fixed it would be smashed again.

Bone contains marrow, marrow contains nerves, and even the slightest touch could bring unbearable agony. It was easy to imagine how immense the torment Yang Kai endured at that moment must have been.

It was not that only a single bone had broken; no bone in his body remained intact.

Had it been someone else—even a person a thousandfold stronger than Yang Kai—they would likely have blacked out; yet Yang Kai did not. The excruciating pain sharpened his mind, though it multiplied the intensity of suffering a thousand times over.

A harrowing cry rang out from the hut, startling a nearby Lingxiao Pavilion disciple who hurriedly fled without looking back.

In the midst of it, Yang Kai seemed to receive an impression from the Golden Body: erase Yang Kai’s consciousness, seize this flesh!

Yang Kai refused to yield. Though paralyzed, he fought to keep his mind clear and refused to let the Golden Body usurp him. The Golden Body, not to be cowed, repeatedly shattered his bones and tormented his nerves to drive him into oblivion.

One was the Indomitable Golden Body; the other, a soul of unyielding will—who would triumph could not be known until the very end.

Yang Kai realized this was truly a matter of life and death, not a mere contest with senior brothers back at the sect; if he failed to endure, Yang Kai would cease to exist. He had to hold on, no matter the pain.

A grueling tug‑of‑war between Yang Kai’s consciousness and the Golden Body’s destructive force raged within him, the battlefield being his own flesh. Blow after blow, neither side relented.

As time wore on, Yang Kai suddenly noticed the unbearable pain gradually subsiding, and his spirits lifted.

It was no wonder—the Golden Body’s repeated smashing and mending had, through destruction and reconstruction, infused Yang Kai’s body with elements of the Golden Body. His bones grew steadily stronger while the Golden Body’s energy dwindled. As the balance shifted, the pain naturally lessened. Once the Golden Body fully integrated into him, the war would end.

The scale of victory tipped in Yang Kai’s favor. The intolerable agony turned into tolerable discomfort, then into a prickling itch, and finally into a blissful ease—an enlightening sensation that seemed to open every pore in his body.

Detecting the Golden Body’s last flicker of resistance, Yang Kai spat a curse and, with all his will, drove his consciousness forward to crush it.

At last his body stilled.

A sigh seemed to whisper in his ear—laden with relief and a touch of satisfaction.
