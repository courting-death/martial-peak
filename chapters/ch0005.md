## Chapter 5 — Proud Bone Golden Body

The meaning of these thirty-two characters was quite clear, and Yang Kai naturally understood them.

However, the origin of the Black Book was unclear, which made Yang Kai somewhat wary. What if it was some kind of trap? Thinking this, Yang Kai gave a wry smile; after all, he was just a Trial Disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion. Who would bother to go to such lengths to target him?

But judging from the literal words in the following lines, the reason the Black Stone Pillow transformed into the Black Book was probably related to the dream he had today.

He had used this pillow for over a year without change, yet today it suddenly turned into this Black Book. This was clearly linked to the change in his state of mind within the dream.

It was precisely because of his transformation that the Black Stone Pillow had changed as well.

Since he had caused the birth of this Black Book, then the Black Book was born to serve him! He was its master!

With this thought, Yang Kai no longer hesitated. The script on the Black Book clearly required him to use his blood as a trigger. With a mindset of giving it a try, Yang Kai bit his finger hard, then held it over the first page of the Black Book.

Blood dripped down drop by drop. At first, nothing happened, but as time passed, the Black Book withered and released layers of black light. Yang Kai, already in poor physical condition and recently wounded, started to feel dizzy and faint after this ordeal.

Yet he gritted his teeth and endured it. The blood continued to flow, and the light on the pages grew increasingly intense.

After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Yang Kai nearly fainted to the ground, but only then did the page show substantial change. The black light swirled and contracted, forming a small vortex in the middle of the page.

Suddenly, a glimmer of golden light flashed within the vortex. Yang Kai struggled to keep his mind clear, staring intently at the unfolding spectacle.

Within the black vortex, a shiny, smooth, golden object gradually rose.

Yang Kai was shocked—there really was something inside the page. Although when deciding to drip his blood he was somewhat hopeful, he had never imagined it would actually succeed.

Yet now, everything before his eyes proved that those thirty-two characters on the page were not false.

Blood as a guide, Golden Body descends!

What kind of Golden Body was this? Yang Kai's pale face brimmed with anticipation.

Moments later, when the shiny golden object was fully revealed, Yang Kai swallowed hard. No matter how vivid his imagination was, he had never expected the Golden Body to look like this.

It was a golden skeleton about half a chi tall, the very first part revealed being the gleaming skull. The golden skeleton hovered on the Black Book's page, sitting cross-legged in meditation. Every bone emitted golden radiance, illuminating Yang Kai’s small room in a splendid golden light.

The black vortex on the page gradually faded away, everything returning to calm.

Looking at this strange golden skeleton, Yang Kai was at a loss for what to do next. The page only explained how to summon the Golden Body but said nothing about what to do once it appeared.

Watching it, Yang Kai suddenly felt something was amiss. This golden skeleton clearly had no eyes, yet he felt as if it were scrutinizing him. It had no mouth, yet seemed to be mocking his weakness.

Sensing this, Yang Kai was furious and reached out sharply to grab the golden skeleton.

A mere little skeleton, how dare it be so insolent!

Unexpectedly, as soon as he moved, the golden skeleton flew straight at him, passing right through his hand and imprinting on his chest.

This was an incredibly terrifying sight—when the skeleton struck Yang Kai’s body, golden light blazed forth. The skeleton transformed into countless glowing particles that seeped through the pores of Yang Kai’s limbs and torso.

In an instant, his entire body was engulfed in pain, a pain that was no ordinary ache but one that came from deep within the marrow! Yang Kai cried out in agony and fell to the ground, curling up like a prawn, wracked with spasms.

His bones all seemed to shatter at that moment. He didn’t even have the strength to move a single finger. This was no illusion—if Yang Kai could peer inside himself, he would see each bone shattered cleanly, with a layer of golden light wrapping around the broken bones, constantly repairing them, but the repair speed was far slower than the destruction. Just as one was fixed, it was shattered again.

Bones contain marrow, marrow contains nerves; even the slightest touch could cause enormous harm. One could imagine the torment Yang Kai was enduring.

It was not just a single broken bone; every bone in his body was damaged.

An ordinary person, even one thousands of times stronger than Yang Kai, would likely faint now. But Yang Kai did not; the severe pain sharpened his mind instead. The price was that the pain was magnified many folds.

Grotesque cries echoed from the small room. Not far away, some Lingxiao Pavilion disciples walking by were startled and fled in panic.

In the darkness, Yang Kai seemed to sense a message brought by the Golden Body: to annihilate Yang Kai’s consciousness and seize control of this body!

How could Yang Kai allow this? Though unable to move, he fought to keep his mind clear, refusing to let the Golden Body take over. The Golden Body was likewise relentless, repeatedly smashing his bones and tormenting his nerves to force him into unconsciousness.

One was the Proud Bone Golden Body; the other possessed an unyielding soul. Which would prevail could not be seen until the very end.

Yang Kai knew this was a true life-or-death struggle, unlike contests against fellow sect disciples. If he couldn’t endure it, the world would lose Yang Kai forever. So he had to hold on, no matter the pain.

His consciousness and the Golden Body’s destructive force engaged in a fierce tug-of-war inside his body. They battled fiercely, showing no signs of backing down.

As time went on, Yang Kai was shocked to find the unbearable pain gradually lessened, lifting his spirits considerably.

This was no surprise. After shattering Yang Kai’s bones, the Golden Body repaired them again and again. Through this cycle of destruction and rebirth, Yang Kai’s body began to incorporate aspects of the Golden Body. His bones grew stronger, and the Golden Body’s energy waned. As one rose and the other fell, the pain naturally eased. Once the Golden Body fully integrated into Yang Kai, the war would end.

The scales of victory slowly tipped toward Yang Kai. The unbearable pain turned into something bearable, then to an itchy tingling, then to a state of unparalleled comfort, like a vast enlightenment flooding through him, every pore of his body involuntarily opening.

Sensing that the Golden Body inside was still stubbornly resisting, Yang Kai cursed fiercely and pushed his consciousness forward in a single surge to crush it.

Finally, peace settled inside his body.

By his ear, it seemed as if a sigh faintly sounded, filled with relief and a hint of liberation.
