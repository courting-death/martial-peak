## Chapter 5 – Proud Bone Golden Body

Yang Kai had no trouble understanding those thirty-two characters, yet the Black Book’s murky origin made him wary. What if it was some trap? Then he scoffed at himself—who would devise so elaborate a scheme for a mere Trial Disciple?

Judging from the later lines, the pillow’s transformation into a book must be linked to today’s dream. He had slept on it a year without change; only after his inward awakening did it reveal this form. Thus the Black Book was born in response to him—he must be its rightful owner.

Resolved, Yang Kai bit his fingertip hard and let the blood drip onto the first page.

At first nothing happened. As time passed, black ripples spread across the page. Already weak from injury and blood loss, Yang Kai grew dizzy, but he gritted his teeth and endured. The page glowed darker and darker until, after a full cup of tea, a small vortex appeared at the center.

From the vortex a glint of gold emerged.

Yang Kai’s heart pounded. There really is something hidden!

The words had not lied: _With blood as guide, the Golden Body descends._  
But what sort of Golden Body?

When the object finally rose clear, Yang Kai swallowed. Never had he imagined a Golden Body would look like this.

It was a golden skeleton no more than half a foot tall. Head first, it drifted free of the page, sitting cross-legged in perfect meditation posture. Each bone shone, filling the small hut with dazzling gold.

The vortex faded; all stilled.

Yang Kai stared, uncertain what to do. The page had told how to summon the Golden Body, but not what followed.

As he watched, an uneasy feeling grew. The skeleton had no eyes, yet he felt it sizing him up; it had no mouth, yet seemed to mock his weakness.

Anger flared. He reached to seize it—but the skeleton shot forward, passed through his hand, and struck his chest. Brilliant light burst; the figure dissolved into countless motes that flooded his pores.

Agony exploded from the marrow outward. Yang Kai screamed and collapsed, body arched like a shrimp in spasm.

Every bone seemed to shatter at once. If he could have looked within, he would have seen splintered shards wrapped in gold light that strove to mend them, only for each repair to be broken anew.

The torment was beyond imagination, yet Yang Kai did not faint. Pain sharpened his mind. Through the haze he sensed a message: _Erase Yang Kai’s will—seize this body!_

Never! Though helpless, he clung to consciousness. The Golden Body pressed, shattering bone after bone to erode his spirit.

One was Proud Bone Golden Body; the other, a soul that would not yield. Neither retreated. The battlefield was Yang Kai’s own flesh.

Time crawled. The unbearable pain slowly dulled. Each cycle of destruction and repair left his bones infused with golden power; they grew stronger as the Golden Body’s energy waned. Pain lessened to aching, then to tingling, then to a rush of euphoria—as though every pore opened to fresh spring wind.

Sensing the last flicker of resistance within, Yang Kai’s will surged and crushed it.

Silence.

In his mind he heard a faint sigh—part relief, part approval.
