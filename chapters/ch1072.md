## Chapter 1072 — Break the Cauldrons and Sink the Boats?

Entering the Saint Realm, in a fertile place like Rainfall Star it hardly counts as a top-tier cultivation — there are handfuls of people at that Stage in any crowd.

Yang Kai stood on a high slope, a wine skin clutched in his hand, drinking as he watched the scene below.

He had no intention of intervening; he’d decided to simply watch the show.

The warrior was clearly no match for the Jade-Eyed Fire Dragon; his body was smeared with blood, utterly dishevelled, having cheated death several times. His defensive Secret Treasure had been smashed to pieces, and a sharp horn from the Jade-Eyed Fire Dragon had impaled his abdomen, blood pouring out.

Yang Kai was certain the man was doomed, and, losing interest, was about to leave when the battle took a sudden turn.

The Eighth-Tier Demonic Beast that had held absolute advantage began to fall back, retreating again and again, howling in fury.

After the warrior’s defensive Secret Treasure was completely destroyed, he unleashed an unimaginable surge of power, casting aside all defenses and charging the Jade-Eyed Fire Dragon with a reckless, death‑defying stance.

Half an hour later, the Jade-Eyed Fire Dragon lay dead, its entrails and blood strewn across the ground.

The Saint Realm warrior breathed raggedly, stuffing recovery Pills into his mouth by the handful, but no matter how many he took he could not staunch his wounds; blood gushed everywhere and the life force rapidly fled from his body.

The gap in strength was too great — though the warrior finally slew the Jade-Eyed Fire Dragon, he could only force a mutual destruction; that was the limit of what he could do.

Yang Kai hefted his wine skin, walked up to him, and stood over the wounded man, looking down.

The warrior’s dull, terrified eyes suddenly brightened with a thread of divine light as he painfully stretched a hand toward Yang Kai, as if trying to grab at his remaining life, yet grasping empty air again and again.

His face was full of a desperate craving for life.

Yang Kai took a sip of wine, crouched down, and wordlessly squeezed a drop of golden blood from his finger, letting it fall into the wounded man’s gaping mouth.

Demon God Golden Blood — it possessed extraordinarily potent restorative power; Yang Kai had relied on it several times to crawl back from death.

Yet he always felt his own Demon God Golden Blood was not in the same league as the Great Demon God’s when the latter had possessed it in life.

A single drop of the Great Demon God’s blood contained boundless power and myriad arcane mysteries; Yang Kai had gleaned a divine morsel of technique from it, and even the Demon General Xueli had reaped great benefit from a drop of Demon God Golden Blood.

Though the quality differed greatly, it still had some healing function.

In an instant the wounded man was wrapped in a faint golden radiance. An astonishing look crossed his face as he felt his condition improve dramatically; the approaching death fled, and he found a spark of hope to live.

He stared at Yang Kai in bewilderment, unsure why this passing stranger had saved his life.

He opened his mouth but could not force out a sound.

Yang Kai grinned at him and said, “No need to thank me. I should be the one thanking you. Well, this is all I can do for you — whether you live or die now is up to fate.”

Saying that, he tossed the untouched wine skin onto the ground and strode off, laughter trailing behind him.

Long after, the warrior painfully sat up, staring in the direction Yang Kai had gone, utterly baffled; he had no idea what Yang Kai was thanking him for and simply assumed the youth was a lunatic!

Still, there was no denying the other had saved his life; grateful, he snatched up the wine skin Yang Kai had left, gulped down a mouthful to celebrate surviving death. The fiery liquor made him grit his teeth in pain and sweat profusely; he dared not act rashly and quickly circulated his inner arts, sitting to heal his wounds.

In the valley, Zong Ao was laboring to refine Pills; he no longer used sheer quantity as his method, but, like Yang Kai, chose the best alchemical furnace and used the technique Yang Kai had taught him to concoct elixirs.

Each time a pill bearing Pill Patterns emerged from the furnace, Zong Ao’s old face would blossom like a chrysanthemum. The wrinkles piled atop one another, making him look downright frightening—yet he reveled in it without the slightest restraint.

No one ever came to this cursed place anyway; Yang Kai had already left, the only outsider still here lay unconscious, and no one had seen his terrifying appearance — he had no need for caution.

Just as things reached a critical point, Zong Ao’s expression changed and he murmured, “Back already?”

He sensed a life force rapidly approaching this side, brazen and exceedingly fast.

On Rainfall Star, besides Yang Kai no one else would dare act like this — not even Lin Mufeng or Halika and the like.

He hastily ended what he was doing and, ignoring the Pills that had failed to refine, stood ready.

A moment later, Yang Kai walked in.

Squinting, Zong Ao was taken aback; the words on his lips were swallowed back down.

He had intended to comfort Yang Kai, to urge him to regard life and death with equanimity, yet he found Yang Kai now grinning from ear to ear, an indescribable aura suffusing him.

Zong Ao stared for a long time before realizing that aura was confidence.

He slowly shook his head, donned a smile, and asked cheerfully, “Did you find a solution?”

“No!” Yang Kai replied happily.

“Why are you so happy if you didn’t find it?” Zong Ao was more puzzled.

“Why can’t I be happy without finding it?” Yang Kai countered. “Though I haven’t found it, I feel I should succeed.”

“What do you mean?” Zong Ao was baffled by Yang Kai’s few words; if he hadn’t found the method, how could he be sure of success? Grabbing Yang Kai’s sleeve, he demanded, “Say it clearly.”

“I can’t explain it. Watch and see whether I can make a Pill Cloud!” Yang Kai wriggled free of the iron‑callused hand and straightened his robes.

Zong Ao fell silent, restrained his aura, and stepped aside to watch Yang Kai’s movements.

He had long wanted to ask Yang Kai: since his soul had been bound to that girl by a Soul Chain and tied to her life, why not travel to Shuiyue Star and have the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s attendant break the Soul Chain? Even if someone had to die, it would be only that girl.

There was plenty of time; even if they set out now it would be in time.

But he felt that since Yang Kai hadn’t done that, there must be inconvenient reasons or secrets unknown to others; Zong Ao couldn’t be bothered to pry and didn’t wish to.

Lost in thought, Yang Kai had already taken his seat cross‑legged before the familiar alchemical furnace.

Zong Ao watched as Yang Kai took handfuls of medicinal herbs from his Spatial Ring, and upon closer inspection discovered they were the very materials Halika had once given — those used to refine the Leaving Flame Pill.

Nearly two hundred portions remained, piled into a small mountain.

After emptying the ring, Yang Kai took one of each herb from that little mountain.

Pitch‑black Demonic Flame leapt from his hand like a fireball, consuming the mound of herbs; the Saint King‑Grade materials were instantly reduced to ash and vanished.

Zong Ao’s eyes widened and shock showed plainly on his face.

He never expected Yang Kai to do something so mad immediately upon returning.

Break the cauldrons and sink the boats?

This brat had set fire to the remaining nearly two hundred portions of materials, leaving only one. Success or failure would come from just this one chance — was he really going to break the cauldrons and sink the boats?

Was he trying to force his potential forward with overwhelming pressure?

Zong Ao slowly shook his head, a look of disappointment forming; in martial arts or in cultivation, even in battle, such desperate measures can be understandable and might yield results unattainable by normal means.

But applying that same pattern to alchemy would be a grave mistake.

The pressure born of breaking the cauldrons and sinking the boats would be thousands of times more terrifying than usual; alchemy, which requires a calm heart, simply does not suit such a path and would only make matters worse.

If Yang Kai truly was breaking the cauldrons and sinking the boats, Zong Ao concluded he might not even be able to produce Pill Patterns.

As disappointment mounted, his eyes suddenly brightened and he stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, pondering.

To his surprise, Yang Kai sitting there appeared utterly relaxed, showing no trace of pressure; that confidence had not been diminished by the destruction of the nearly two hundred materials — it had grown stronger.

From Yang Kai Zong Ao saw a conviction — an unshakeable belief he could succeed, an elevation of confidence.

Zong Ao was slightly stunned.

How could he be so certain he could achieve his aim with this last portion? What was his reliance, what gave him such assurance?

Zong Ao sat up straight, focused intently without blinking.

As before with the Leaving Flame Pill, every procedure was precise, without the slightest error.

He carved the spirit formation, refined the medicinal liquid, controlled the fire and the timing of herb input. He altered the spirit formation...

Yang Kai seemed merely to be repeating what he had done over the past six months, yet Zong Ao felt this refining was fundamentally different — the same motions, the same processes, but they conveyed a new, startling quality.

Infectious in its practiced, confident air, Zong Ao could not help but begin to believe Yang Kai might accomplish that inconceivable feat.

He widened his eyes further, waiting for the moment the Pill Cloud would first form.

Time dragged, Zong Ao’s tension mounting; he couldn’t help clenching his fists, and even a man as hardy as he felt each moment like an age, impatient for the result.

Yang Kai, however, maintained a placid countenance; the world seemed to shrink to the furnace and the churning medicine within, and he briefly forgot his own presence.

The Saint Realm warrior who had fought the Jade-Eyed Fire Dragon to the death did not win because of overwhelming power but because of his unyielding momentum.

He was certain of victory because he knew failure meant death.

Thus he won, even though he nearly perished alongside the Jade-Eyed Fire Dragon.

Yang Kai drew inspiration from that battle, which was why he had saved the man’s life.

The failures of the past six months of refining had piled pressure upon him; each time he worried about the consequences of failure, distractions crept in, and producing a Pill Cloud under such conditions would be a miracle.

But now, his mind was free of distractions.

He burned the nearly two hundred portions not to throw himself into a desperate, do‑or‑die state, but to test his own faith — to see if his belief would waver once those materials were gone.

It did not waver, so he grew ever more confident.
