## Chapter 1703 — Body-Tempering Pill and Sea Lotus

At the command of the lanky leader, his subordinates surged forward, quickly binding the remaining human and Sea Race cultivators hand and foot. Any who dared resist were met with a flurry of fists and kicks, beaten until their faces were swollen and bruised.

No matter their cultivation level, every one of the men following the lanky leader was, without exception, far superior in physical constitution to the outsiders, so the Sea Race's resistance could not be tolerated and was quickly crushed.

The lanky man gave a thin, false smile and said, "Behave and you'll be treated well, but if any of you dare cause trouble, heh heh… a fair number still die on Ghost Isle every year; think that over yourselves."

Pang Zhen and Qian Mo's faces both darkened as an ominous sensation crept into their hearts.

……

A hundred li away, Yang Kai frowned as he looked at the two corpses on the ground and sighed softly.

He had only recently arrived and had not wished to unleash a slaughter.

But the two who had chased him would not relent and seemed intent on wiping him out; forced by circumstances, Yang Kai had no choice but to kill.

Without being able to employ Saint Yuan, there were scarcely a handful in the entire Star Domain who could match Yang Kai in raw physical strength; these two obscure lackeys were hardly his opponents.

In three or so moves they had collapsed to the ground.

Yang Kai looted their Spatial Rings, then picked a direction and swiftly departed.

Half an hour later more warriors came by, and upon seeing the two corpses on the ground their faces changed; they hurried back to Ghost Isle to report.

By that time Yang Kai was already several hundred li away.

Inside a natural sea-side cavern, Yang Kai sat cross-legged; the cave was damp and inhospitable, but he no longer cared about such things.

Sitting on the ground, he tried to circulate the Saint Yuan in his body and to communicate with the Dark Star—both attempts failed without exception.

This strange place had indeed severed his connection with Dark Star, wiping out his greatest advantage completely.

Yang Kai's face looked rather sullen.

Fortunately, although his Divine Sense had been suppressed to an extreme, it still functioned to a degree; without it he couldn't have retrieved items from the Spatial Ring or used the Secret Treasures he had nurtured within his body.

Whether it was a Spatial Ring or a Secret Treasure, a certain level of Divine Sense was required as a bridge; once Divine Sense could not be used, those external forces could not be accessed.

That fact comforted Yang Kai somewhat.

After thinking it over, he retrieved the Spatial Rings from the two men he'd killed and began searching their possessions.

With his current means, he naturally would not value the wealth of two ordinary warriors; however, through their items he could glean information about Ghost Isle, so before leaving he took their Spatial Rings.

Their cultivation levels must not have been high, and the seals on the rings were easily broken by Yang Kai.

On careful inspection he found the two were poor; besides some food, the rings contained only a few Saint Crystals, several low-grade Secret Treasures, martial manuals that Yang Kai had no use for, and a few jade flasks.

Saint Crystals were useless here—without Saint Yuan they were inert.

He paid no mind to the Secret Treasures or the martial manuals.

He took out the jade flasks, uncorked one, and poured a gray pill from it.

The moment he held it, Yang Kai curled his lips in disdain.

As a Void King-Grade alchemist, he could instantly see the pill had been imperfectly refined; it could not be called a failure, but it certainly had not realized the full potential of its raw materials—the method was crude and the medicinal potency had not been condensed.

This pill was nothing more than several ingredients mixed together and roughly formed—an abortive product.

However, remembering that Saint Yuan couldn’t be used in this damned place, Yang Kai understood.

Without Saint Yuan, an alchemist could not condense the medicinal fluids or fully activate the materials; this likely explained the incomplete refinement of such pills.

Although Yang Kai's standards made him scorn such a Spiritual Pill, he remained curious about its effects.

None of the Spiritual Pills he had known so far matched what he held now, which made him click his tongue in surprise.

After observing and sniffing the pill for a while and confirming it wasn't poisonous, he popped one into his mouth.

Moments later Yang Kai's brow rose in astonishment and he murmured, "So that's it—no wonder their physical constitutions were so good; it was because of these pills!"

From tasting it he immediately understood the pill's purpose.

It was a pill for tempering the body!

After swallowing the pill, Yang Kai clearly felt a warm current rise from his lower abdomen, flow through his limbs and bones, altering his organs and tendons and improving his body.

A single pill barely affected Yang Kai and was almost negligible.

But for those who had not specially tempered their bodies, it provided some benefit; if one took such Spiritual Pills for years, the body's constitution would undoubtedly improve.

This was likely the very reason why those living on Ghost Isle had far hardier bodies than outsiders, be they humans or of the Sea Race.

They must have all been taking this kind of Spiritual Pill!

On Ghost Isle Saint Yuan couldn't be used and Divine Sense was utterly suppressed, yet the residents had found another way to strengthen themselves; everything had its reason.

Yang Kai grew quite interested in these Spiritual Pills.

But he had no recipe and didn't know the raw materials, so he set the matter aside for the time being.

Emerging from the cave, Yang Kai scanned the distance and could faintly see a city at the center of Ghost Isle—the inhabitants' dwelling place; at the city's heart stood a building towering so high it seemed to pierce the heavens and vanish into the sky.

He withdrew his gaze, looked to the rolling sea, and without hesitation leapt into the water, using his hands and feet to swim forward.

Unable to deploy Saint Yuan, he had to rely on the most primitive means to go to sea.

He could now determine Ghost Isle was an independent, enclosed space—like the Floating Continent he had fallen into when first stranding in the Star Domain; it had its own natural laws and was unaffected by the Dark Star.

If it was a sealed space there should be a boundary; Yang Kai planned to find that limit and see whether he could break it to escape.

Even if he failed, he could try other measures later—such as infiltrating the city to question the island's lord, who would surely know more than any passerby.

The sea water was icy cold, but Yang Kai's speed was great.

Many sea beasts lived in the waters, vicious and ferocious, and they were smashed to pieces beneath his fists and feet.

After a few days Yang Kai noticed these sea beasts were unlike those outside; their bodies seemed far tougher than their kin, and killing them in the sea truly cost him effort.

Over these days he occasionally spotted a few boats sailing in certain sea regions.

They must be the vessels of Ghost Isle's residents; judging by their busied and intent manner, they seemed to be searching the sea for something.

Yang Kai did not wish to expose his whereabouts and thus avoided them whenever possible.

These ships could only operate near the coast; the farther out they went, the less daring they became. After all, the deeper one ventured into the sea, the greater the dangers that awaited. The fact that those Sea Beasts couldn’t withstand Yang Kai’s hand didn’t mean they were weak.

After several days of finding nothing, Yang Kai saw no one and yet did not give up, continuing his exploration.

That day, amid the vast expanse of the sea, Yang Kai suddenly sensed something. He quickly focused his mind and gazed intently ahead.

A patch of multicolored light penetrated the thin mist and entered his sight.

Yang Kai's spirits lifted and he rapidly headed toward it.

After several days of staring at nothing but the same monotonous ocean, this change delighted him immensely.

Whatever those multicolored lights were, they were better than the unvarying sea.

In no time Yang Kai arrived.

But the sight before him made him slightly stunned.

In the middle of the sea there was a field of lotuses!

Roughly counting, at least dozens of lotuses bloomed on the sea's surface in varying colors—pink, cyan, silver, gold—each exuding swirling Spiritual Qi.

"Sea Lotus?" Yang Kai frowned.

This cluster was clearly not ordinary sea lotuses but rare alchemical materials.

Brightening, he swam forward to a cyan Sea Lotus, plucked a petal and chewed it.

Moments later his eyes brightened and he laughed out loud: "So the main ingredient of that pill was this!"

He had long been intrigued by that peculiar type of Spiritual Pill, but regrettably, he never knew what ingredients it required. Who would have thought that this voyage out to sea would yield such an unexpected windfall — he had stumbled upon it with ease.

It dawned on him that the few boats he had encountered earlier must have been out searching for these Sea Lotuses.

Unfortunately, they could only move about near the coastal waters, and so had completely missed the Sea Lotuses here.

Yang Kai cheerfully harvested the plants, preserved them with special techniques, and stored them in his Spatial Ring.

From his investigations he discovered the Lotuses' medicinal potency varied by color: pink had the weakest effect, then cyan, then silver, and gold the strongest.

The rarer the potency, the fewer the flowers; the golden Sea Lotus existed as a single blossom, standing aloof in the pond's center.

There were only six silver ones, making them exceedingly precious.

With these materials in his hands Yang Kai could accomplish great things; at his level he could deduce the prescription for the body-tempering Spiritual Pill and later refine it himself.
