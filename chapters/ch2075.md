## Chapter 2075 — Dare Stop Me and Die

In that instant, Zhuang Pan suddenly realized that the spirit of his treasure pagoda had suffered grievous damage!

His pagoda was a Dao Origin-Grade Lower-Level Secret Treasure; he had spent many years tempering and nurturing it with Secret Techniques using his blood and Divine Sense, binding it closely to himself. Although that method greatly increased the pagoda's potency, it also meant that if the pagoda were damaged, its owner would suffer corresponding backlash!

At that moment, he suffered a tremendous backlash...

The Origin Qi in his body surged and roiled, nearly berserk; he had no strength to suppress it, which was why he had to spit out a blood jet.

Crackle…

The lightning that had danced over the pagoda continued for a while before gradually fading away.

The surface of the pagoda seemed unscathed, but its spirit had been greatly diminished, and Zhuang Pan could sense that the interior of his pagoda had in fact suffered extensive damage, riddled with many cracks — to repair it fully would require special materials and a long time.

Struck by this, Zhuang Pan again felt Qi and blood surge violently; he kept vomiting blood.

"Deputy City Lord!" the guard who had earlier come in to report cried out in alarm.

Zhuang Pan clutched his chest, his face deathly pale, breath uneven; he stared at Yang Kai nearby with a look of terror and disbelief.

He simply could not understand what level that orb-like Secret Treasure was to unleash such force in a single strike — it had even overwhelmed his Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure!

Had that blow struck him directly, would there have been any life left?

If he had known that the orb was an Imperial Treasure, he would probably have found some consolation.

After all, Zhuang Pan was a Dao Origin Realm expert; Yang Kai did not wish to waste time, so he had, at once, brought forth one of the two Imperial Treasure beads — the Extinction Thunder Bead.

When he had obtained the Extinction Thunder Bead back then, he was only in the Origin Returning Realm. Although he could trigger the bead, his realm was insufficient to unleash its full might.

He had used it many times since; with each increase in his power, the Extinction Thunder Bead's effectiveness had grown.

Now that he was in the Dao Origin Realm and could call upon the Power of the Laws, even though he still could not release the Imperial Treasure's full power, it was far beyond what a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure could withstand.

Which was stronger was self-evident.

"Deputy City Lord Zhuang, restrain yourself! If you dare block me again, don't blame Yang for being merciless!" Yang Kai said coldly as he fixed Zhuang Pan with an icy stare.

Zhuang Pan's face went ashen; he opened his mouth but dared not utter even a placating phrase.

He could feel that Yang Kai was not bluffing or making idle threats — if he interfered in the slightest, he might truly perish.

"Hahaha. What a boastful fellow." Suddenly, a hearty laugh came from outside, and two figures, one thin and one fat, darted in.

At the same time, a thick scent of wine filled the great hall.

Yang Kai frowned and glanced at the newcomers.

He recognized both: the short, fat man was the eccentric Deputy City Lord known as Drunken Old Man; upon entering the hall he scanned the place and his eyes narrowed.

But he quickly composed himself, took down the large gourd at his waist, and gulped a mouthful of wine as if to calm his nerves.

The slightly thinner martial artist was none other than Duan Yuanshan, the City Lord of Fenglin City!

He was also the only Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm expert in Fenglin City.

Yang Kai had met Duan Yuanshan many times and was of course not unfamiliar with him.

Duan Yuanshan's eyes glittered with interest as he sized up Yang Kai and laughed, "Since when did Fenglin City gain another Dao Origin Realm? Truly delightful news!"

He showed no intention of investigating Yang Kai for injuring Zhuang Pan; instead he wore an expression of apparent satisfaction.

Their sudden arrival was not hard to understand — this was the City Lord's manor, and Duan Yuanshan and the Drunken Old Man both lived here; who could fail to notice the strong energy fluctuations from the clash of Secret Treasures between Yang Kai and Zhuang Pan earlier?

So they had come at the same time.

"Greetings, City Lord, greetings, Deputy City Lord!" Yang Kai frowned and cupped his fist to both.

The Drunken Old Man grinned, wiped the wine from his mouth, returned the salute casually, said little, and instead found a spot against a pillar to sit lazily, gulping more wine from his gourd.

Duan Yuanshan snorted, "No need for such formality, friend — may I ask your name?"

"I am Yang Kai."

"So it's Brother Yang!" Duan Yuanshan's face flickered with doubt. "This city lord recalls no prominent Yang family in Fenglin City!"

"I'm nothing more than a lone wandering cultivator — I only arrived in Fenglin City a little over a year ago!"

"I see!" Duan Yuanshan displayed a trace of surprise, then said, "Then what caused you and Brother Zhuang to come to blows? We're all Dao Origin Realm — why not sit and talk instead of getting so heated?"

"City Lord, this man is somewhat arrogant and disregards the city's rules; he drove a tower-ship into the city. Zhuang merely wanted to make inquiries, but he refused to cooperate — I ask the City Lord to look into it!" Zhuang Pan spoke before Yang Kai could, and his account was not exaggerated.

"Is that so?" Duan Yuanshan frowned and turned to look at Yang Kai.

"Yes, that's true!" Yang Kai nodded.

Zhuang Pan sneered, "City Lord, the rules of Fenglin City were set by you; this man now flouts them and damages order. How should he be handled?"

He had been bested by Yang Kai earlier, and even his own pagoda's spirit had been grievously harmed; his hatred for Yang Kai had reached the extreme. Now that Duan Yuanshan and the Drunken Old Man had arrived together, if they could convict Yang Kai, they could give him a lesson.

This pleased him greatly.

"If, after hearing this, the City Lord still wants to punish Yang, then Yang has nothing to say!" Yang Kai interrupted Duan Yuanshan with a cold laugh.

"What news?" Duan Yuanshan asked, puzzled at Yang Kai's serious tone.

"Two thousand li away, the seal on an Ancient Great Demon's prison has been broken; pure Demonic Qi has leaked out and will soon harry Fenglin City," Yang Kai said.

"What?" Duan Yuanshan exclaimed in shock. "The seal on an Ancient Great Demon? Pure Demonic Qi leaking?"

The Drunken Old Man, leaning against a stone pillar and tasting wine in a drunken haze, froze; the intoxication fled his face as he gaped at Yang Kai, the wine at his mouth spilled without his noticing.

"Nonsense!" Zhuang Pan roared angrily from the side. "City Lord, don't listen to this man's lies — he..."

Duan Yuanshan raised a hand to stop him and, turning serious, asked Yang Kai, "Is this true? Where did you get this information? Any proof?"

"I saw it with my own eyes! I fled back to Fenglin City on the same route." Yang Kai glanced at Zhuang Pan, sneered, and pointed at Mo Xiaoqi. "My friend here cares for the safety of hundreds of thousands in Fenglin City and came to inform the City Lord so you could prepare, yet Deputy City Lord Zhuang would not act. Rather, he fussed over my temporary breach of rules by flying into the city with a tower-ship, made a fuss, and even fought. As for proof... go see for yourselves — it's only two thousand li, not too far!"

"I'll go see!" The Drunken Old Man, hearing this, dared not delay; he fastened his gourd and shot out like a streak of light.

"I've said what I will say, City Lord. I take my leave." Yang Kai finished, gave Mo Xiaoqi a look, and she understood, hurrying outside.

"You can't go! The matter isn't settled..." Zhuang Pan cried out from where he stood, trying to sound fierce but inwardly trembling.

"If you dare stop me, I'll make you die!" Yang Kai did not look back; with that threat tossed over his shoulder, he and Mo Xiaoqi vanished.

"City Lord, this man is far too arrogant and overbearing!" Zhuang Pan could not stop Yang Kai and now pinned his hopes on Duan Yuanshan to rein him in.

Duan Yuanshan looked at him slowly and said coolly, "If what this man says is true... Fenglin City may be in mortal peril!"

Hearing that, Zhuang Pan shivered and fell silent.

Though Duan Yuanshan did not speak further, he need not — his eyes had already shown displeasure and rebuke; he felt anger and urgency.

But... the notion that an Ancient Great Demon's seal had been broken and pure Demonic Qi leaked out seemed impossible no matter how one thought about it!

A moment later, Duan Yuanshan drew out a Transmission Compass from his Spatial Ring and poured his Divine Sense into it; evidently the Drunken Old Man had reported back.

Zhuang Pan watched expectantly, secretly praying that Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi had been fabricating; if so, he would have reason to make trouble for Yang Kai.

And if they had deceived the City Lord, Duan Yuanshan certainly would not let Yang Kai off.

But...

Under Zhuang Pan's anxious gaze, Duan Yuanshan's face suddenly went deathly pale and his body trembled.

"City Lord..." Zhuang Pan cried nervously.

"Order it — activate all the city's defensive arrays; by any means necessary, raise the formations to their maximum power!" Duan Yuanshan shouted, his command echoing through the manor.

"Impossible..." Zhuang Pan's face went ashen and he collapsed to the ground.

Duan Yuanshan glared at him, then vanished amid a blur; moments later, countless commands flowed steadily from his Transmission Compass toward every direction of Fenglin City.

Shortly after, near Fenglin City's walls, a hum arose as many defensive arrays long unused were activated en masse.
