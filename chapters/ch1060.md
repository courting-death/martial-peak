## Chapter 1060 — Deal

Zong Ao flipped the vessel in his hand, and the jade-green liquid tilted and flowed downward in distinct beads like raindrops, as if it had a spirit of its own, each drop seeping into Xue Yue through her pores.

Xue Yue’s perpetually pale face gradually flushed with color as the liquid seeped in, and the heartbeat emanating from her chest grew noticeably stronger than before.

Yang Kai watched without blinking, feeling a little relieved in his heart.

Zong Ao indeed had some ability; Yang Kai could clearly sense that after his ministrations, Xue Yue’s condition was much better than it had been.

Only after the jade-green liquid had been fully absorbed by Xue Yue did Zong Ao step back two paces, a look of soreness crossing his face, as if both the pill and that jade-green liquid were priceless to him.

"Senior, is she healed now?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment and doubt.

"Healed?" Zong Ao glanced at him sideways and sneered, "You’re far too naive if you think the Profound Yin Moon Water’s poison can be cured so easily! Though Profound Yin Moon Water is a cultivation treasure, it carries immense destructive power—any ordinary person touched by it will die! Even Origin Returning Realm warriors cannot withstand its might. This girl’s constitution seems somewhat special, and the secret treasure she wears is of a very high grade; otherwise she would have died long ago."

"You just now..."

"I merely maintained her life; within a year or two she still won’t die!"

"What about after a year or two?" Yang Kai asked urgently.

"That’s uncertain." Zong Ao shook his head slowly. "If a pill can be concocted to save her, she can recover; if one cannot be made... well, prepare to bury her."

Yang Kai’s face changed drastically. He cupped his fists and said respectfully, "Senior, you are truly a righteous person. Please point us a way!"

"Righteous?" Zong Ao raised an eyebrow and laughed aloud. "I am no righteous man! If I maintain her life for you, you must pay me. If you tell me where the Profound Yin Moon Water is, then perhaps I’ll point you the way!"

Yang Kai didn’t hesitate: "I can tell you!"

Halika and Lin Mufeng and the others planned to conceal the Profound Yin Moon Water, but Yang Kai didn’t care about their schemes—there was only one thing for him: Xue Yue must not die!

Zong Ao nodded in satisfaction. "Fine. You take me to the Profound Yin Moon Water and I will tell you how to save her!"

"Deal!" Yang Kai nodded heavily, then added after a moment’s thought, "But that place is now guarded by warriors of the Hengluo Commerce Guild. Halika and Lin Mufeng and the others won’t let you near."

"They dare? If I go, will they dare to stop me?" Zong Ao's expression grew grim. He snorted, "At worst, just give them a share of the benefits!"

He seemed unwilling to make things too antagonistic with the Hengluo Commerce Guild; after all, the Profound Yin Moon Water’s value was immense, and if he kept it all for himself it would surely draw the Commerce Guild’s retaliation.

Sometimes, a step back opens the world wide.

"But before that I must go out for a while. Special containers must be made to collect the Profound Yin Moon Water." Zong Ao seemed to mutter to himself as he instructed Yang Kai, "You stay here, boy. I’ll be back in about half a month. Wait for me."

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Zong Ao moved with decisive speed; having spoken he set off and vanished in an instant, destination unknown.

Since he said he needed special containers, he was likely going to find some master artificer.

Artificers and alchemists were equally noble and scarce talents, especially high-level alchemists and artificers—always courted by major powers.

A man like Zong Ao knowing one or two superb artificers was not surprising.

After Zong Ao’s departure, Halika’s soft call came from outside the palace: "Young Brother, Young Brother!"

He hadn’t left after all. Probably having observed from outside and seeing Zong Ao suddenly depart, he mustered his courage and came to the palace to inquire.

Yang Kai went out and told him the situation in brief. Upon learning Zong Ao had his eyes on the Profound Yin Moon Water, Halika’s face fell and he panicked, not knowing how to deal with Zong Ao’s covetousness.

He didn’t dare report the matter to the main star either. Xue Yue, the Third Young Master’s woman, lay unconscious with her life or death unknown—he was already scrambling to suppress the news, so how could he possibly report it truthfully?

After mulling it over with a sullen expression, and without scolding Yang Kai for speaking, he said, "Since Master Zong Ao claims to have a method to save her, you stay here and wait for his return. I will go consult with Lin Mufeng and the others on how to handle this."

With that he quickly left.

Yang Kai returned to the room and sat on the edge of the bed, staring at Xue Yue as if she were asleep.

This enchanting beauty now wore a calm expression, breathing evenly, sleeping sweetly—her exquisite figure fully revealed.

Yang Kai reached out and gave a firm squeeze to her chest.

He felt he had suffered a great loss! If not for the Soul Chain, he wouldn’t have to go through such trouble, nor worry over Xue Yue’s life and death.

What grated on him most was that even if he saved Xue Yue and later unlocked the Soul Chain, he had no idea how she would regard him—would she become enraged and hunt him down for ten thousand years?

Such an unpredictable future filled Yang Kai with resentment.

But at the time on that death star, forced by circumstances, he had to link his life with Xue Yue’s to survive.

The bitterness in Yang Kai’s heart overran any sweetness—if he didn’t take advantage of the chance to get some benefit, he couldn’t balance it.

Zong Ao was gone for a full half month. During that time Yang Kai stayed in his palace; with Xue Yue still unconscious and requiring no care, he threw himself single-mindedly into Zong Ao’s alchemy chamber.

Dozens of furnaces of varying sizes bore carved spirit formations for alchemy, formations that differed from those hidden in the medicinal fields—these were complete composite spirit formations, one ring fitting into another, each perfectly integrated without any conflict.

Yang Kai unceremoniously imprinted the methods and structures of those formations into his mind, making them his own knowledge.

There was also a study within the palace containing many books, and Yang Kai, bored in his spare time, went in to sift through them.

He immediately found many things that excited him.

Page after page of alchemical recipes he had never seen kept him engrossed, studying them with rapt attention.

The prescriptions Yang Kai knew were all from the Tongxuan Continent, but after coming to the Star Domain, the grade of spiritual herbs and medicines rose, and many things that had never existed on the Tongxuan Continent appeared here.

The alchemical formulas he gathered perfectly filled his gaps, bringing his knowledge and attainment in alchemy in line with the Star Domain.

Half a month passed in the blink of an eye; Yang Kai hardly noticed the time.

Zong Ao’s life aura suddenly returned to the palace and he came straight to the study. Seeing Yang Kai still poring over those alchemical manuscripts, he seemed unconcerned and gestured to him, "Go, lead me to where you found the Profound Yin Moon Water. If I can safely secure those treasures, you may study whatever you wish inside here for as long as you like."

"Good!" Yang Kai set down the tome in his hands and rose to follow him.

"Is my Lady safe if she stays here?" Yang Kai asked, uneasy.

"What could go wrong?" Zong Ao sneered, "No one dares break into my palace, and no one can break in unless several Origin Returning Realm experts charge together! On Rainfall Star, nobody dares offend me like that. Rest assured, this is the safest place on Rainfall Star!"

He wore a smug, self-important air. Yang Kai didn’t think he was boasting without reason—he indeed seemed confident.

The two of them boarded a Star Shuttle and sped toward the mining area.

Within half a day’s time they arrived at the edge of the previous mine pit.

Below many warriors stood in strict formation: Halika, Lin Mufeng, that middle-aged woman, and the Origin Returning Realm experts from the Hengluo Commerce Guild branch—all were present.

They appeared to be waiting.

"These little bastards," Zong Ao spat, displeased.

Seeing Zong Ao’s figure, Halika and the others grew solemn, visibly nervous and helpless. Exchanging glances, they stepped forward.

"We pay our respects to the Master!"

The moment Zong Ao and Yang Kai alighted, Halika and the others bowed in unison, their demeanor humble and respectful.

"Hmm." Zong Ao nodded slightly, neither warm nor cold.

"We heard Master recently used wondrous techniques to save Lady Xue’s life. We are eternally grateful. Lady Xue is a guest from the main star; if misfortune falls upon her, we would be inexcusable. Master, your great virtue toward Lady Xue is also a boon to us..." Halika’s words poured out like a barrage of flattering praise, heaping inflated honors upon Zong Ao.

Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman’s mouths twitched; they felt awkward all over.

Yang Kai’s skin crawled as he looked at Halika with contempt—he had not expected him to be such a person.

"Enough flattery!" Zong Ao waved his hand to cut Halika off, glancing at him askance and snorting, "I don’t buy it!"

Halika immediately looked embarrassed and dared not continue.

"I came here today for a reason, which I trust you all know." Zong Ao came straight to the point. "Anyone who dares to block me, don’t blame me for turning hostile!"

Halika’s face sank and he hurriedly said, "Master, we understand why you’ve come. The Master has spent a hundred years on Rainfall Star making countless pills for our guild for no reward. The Master has done great service, and Chairman Ai Ou has repeatedly instructed us to treat the Master as our most honored guest, to fulfill all his wishes without transgression!"

Zong Ao snorted, "Good, I see you’re sensible."

Halika continued, "If everything else is handed over to the Master, what harm would there be? But as for the Profound Yin Moon Water..."

"Hm?" Zong Ao’s face chilled, his gaze turning hostile.

"It concerns great matters... we really can’t make such a decision rashly!" Halika forced out.

"Indeed, Master. If the main star learns of this, we would be severely punished. Please, Master, understand!" Lin Mufeng stepped forward to plead.
