## Chapter 763 — You Ask Too Many Questions

Soon, Yang Kai was led out of the dungeon by that man; once outside, the man glanced back at him as if about to give a warning, but after taking in Yang Kai's current condition his face changed in disbelief, and he pointed at him with wide eyes: "You... your body..."

"Any problem?" Yang Kai asked indifferently.

"Weren't you near death? How is your body..."

Previously Yang Kai's body had been missing much flesh and blood, even pierced through; his kin all believed he would not live long and was surely a dead man.

Yet now he appeared whole and unscathed, which left the man astonished and unable to accept it.

"My recovery is stronger than ordinary people's!"

"That's way too strong." The man stared at Yang Kai with distrust, then suddenly barked, "Kid, do you have any miraculous pills or medicinal remedies for healing? If you do, hand them over now, or you'll suffer later."

"I don't have such things." Yang Kai shook his head calmly.

The man sized Yang Kai up and down, apparently searching for traces of a Spatial Pouch, but found nothing and grew disappointed; inwardly resentful, he ground his teeth and shoved Yang Kai along into a great hall.

The hall held many people, each with a ruddy complexion and radiant appearance, from whom waves of varying, yet scorching, auras emanated.

Every person here, male or female, old or young, cultivated Yang attribute techniques like Yang Kai; their cultivations were not low either—the weakest among them matched the Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, and several were in the Transcendent Realm.

Dozens had gathered in the hall, led by an elder whose aura was broad and ancient; he had a head of red hair and an imposing presence that commanded respect, showing remarkable vigor for his age.

Beside the elder stood a square-faced youth wearing gray robes; the True Yuan rippling faintly through him also seemed strong.

This young man should be roughly Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm!

When Yang Kai arrived, the group had apparently been discussing something; at his appearance, they all turned their surprised gazes to him and abandoned their previous topic, showing intense interest instead.

"Leader, I've brought the human!" the man who had led Yang Kai in announced, cupping his fist. The elder atop the dais nodded slightly and waved him off; the man retreated respectfully, and before leaving he glared warningly at Yang Kai, hinting he had better behave.

"Yi Feng. Is this the human you captured?" the elder stroked his beard, nodded faintly, and regarded Yang Kai with deep eyes.

As he spoke, Yang Kai clearly felt a scorching aura probe through his body, searching him from within and without.

"Yes, Leader." The youth at his side hastily replied, his expression toward Yang Kai turning strange.

"Wasn't this human nearly dead? How is he now standing here fine?" the elder asked.

Yi Feng scratched his head and frowned. "I don't know either. When I brought him back he truly looked like he was dying—I thought he wouldn't last long... Hey, you brat, what exactly is going on with you?"

Yang Kai glanced between him and the elder and frowned. "From the way you speak, you are not human?"

Only beings of other races would refer to humans as 'humans' in that way.

"Impertinent!" Yi Feng's expression chilled. "Answer my questions when I ask them—this is no place for you to speak."

As he spoke, he waved his hand and a surging force shot out like a whip, striking Yang Kai.

With a crack, a fresh wound split on Yang Kai's body; his True Yuan was sealed and he couldn't dispel the attack.

Yang Kai remained motionless, biting his teeth, his face twisted as he glared at the youth.

"Still got some backbone," Yi Feng sneered, laughter around the edge of his voice as his True Yuan surged, looking ready to teach Yang Kai a lesson.

"Enough, Yi Feng!" the elder suddenly raised a hand to stop the beating and regarded Yang Kai with curiosity, smiling slightly. "This human has some skill—if I'm not mistaken, your physical strength rivals that of an ordinary Saint Realm cultivator, does it not?"

"Impossible, Leader!" Yi Feng's face changed in surprise. "But his cultivation is only First Stage of the Transcendent Realm."

"He must have trained his body relentlessly to reach such prowess; to be so young with such a powerful physique is extraordinary!" the elder said approvingly and asked, "How did you achieve it?"

"Get whipped tens of thousands of times every day and anyone can do it," Yang Kai grinned.

"A foolish method, yet it makes sense." The elder didn't seem intent on probing whether Yang Kai was mocking him, and did not press further. He spoke kindly: "Because you are human, I spared your life instead of killing you outright; had you been a demon, you would not have been so lucky."

His expression turned cold as he continued in a low voice, "Kid, I'll ask you some questions. If your answers satisfy me I may let you live a while longer; if not... you know the consequences."

Trapped under their roof, Yang Kai could only bow.

"Do you have any ties to the demon race?"

"No ties."

"No ties? Then why are you here? How did you enter this place?"

"Under the sea—in an ancient ruin—there was a Void Passage. My companion and I were pursued by a powerful expert and had to enter that Void Passage; when I came to my senses I found myself here."

As Yang Kai spoke, the elder stared at him intently as if trying to detect lies; when he finished and after a moment's thought the elder frowned and said, "Tell me the whole account of your ordeal from the beginning."

Under that penetrating gaze, Yang Kai hid nothing and recounted everything that had happened; the elder's strength was inscrutable, and if he had some special method then lying could backfire now.

"Escaped from a Saint Realm expert?" the elder looked astonished. "You are rather capable!"

"Just lucky, and I almost died."

The elder nodded slightly, accepting Yang Kai's explanation.

"Why do you suspect me of ties to the demon race? And where is my companion now? How is she?" Yang Kai countered.

"Kid, you really do ask a lot of questions," Yi Feng snorted coldly.

The elder frowned slightly, not pleased by Yang Kai's many questions, yet he spoke: "Because only the demon race has ever entered here; you are the first batch of humans to arrive. As for your companion, do not worry—she is fine, only her freedom has been restrained."

Saying this, he turned to Yi Feng and ordered: “Go to the place where they came out and investigate. See if there are any other entrances. If you find one, destroy it immediately!”

Yi Feng was about to agree when Yang Kai interrupted: "No need to check—before coming I destroyed that Void Passage."

"You expect me to believe that?" Yi Feng sneered at Yang Kai and strode off, evidently intending to lead a search party into the forest.

After he left, the elder resumed, "You cultivate a Yang attribute technique?"

Yang Kai nodded.

The elder chuckled: "Humans cultivating Yang attribute techniques are rare; from your looks your method seems not bad."

Yang Kai's expression tightened, thinking the elder might be interested in his True Yang Technique, but the elder had no intention of inquiring deeply and said only, "But no matter how good a technique, compared with ours it still falls far short."

The elder's tone seemed self-evident; the others displayed looks of pride as if Yang Kai's method were worthless.

Yang Kai's expression shifted and he asked, "You all seem to cultivate Yang attribute techniques—what race are you, and what is this place?"

The elder stroked his beard and hesitated: "We could be called human, yet we no longer are."

Yang Kai frowned, puzzled by the vague answer.

"Our ancestors were human, but by our generation we have diverged," the elder said lightly, offering no further explanation. "This is the place we have always dwelt; people outside call it a Small Xuan Realm."

"I saw many imprisoned in that dungeon—are those all demons? Do you bear some grudge against them?" Yang Kai asked.

"Kid, you really ask many questions. You look like a fellow unafraid of death!" the elder glanced coldly at him but then ground his teeth and said, "Our hatred of the demon race is implacable; one day we will eradicate them all. As for you, I will not kill you for now—your body appears unusual and may prove useful."

Saying that, he cast a covetous glance at Yang Kai and waved, "Take him away!"

Someone immediately stepped forward and led Yang Kai away.

After he left, the hall erupted into chatter.

"Leader, the boy's physical constitution is extraordinary, and rarer still is that he cultivates a Yang attribute technique; if he became nourishment for the Divine Tree, it might stabilize it for some time."

"Indeed, the Divine Tree has grown unstable lately—if this continues we may lose our refuge altogether."

"Catching those demons isn't a long-term solution; we must find a way to solve the Divine Tree's problem—without it our clan would face destruction."

"Quiet!" the elder thundered. "Do you think I don't want to solve it? I simply have not found the root cause—how could I resolve it?"

Hearing that, the people's faces fell.

After a moment, the elder instructed, "Xu Chou, go and tell the clan to take good care of the boy—give him the finest food, lift the restrictions on him, and send a fruit of the Divine Tree; I want him restored to his peak strength as soon as possible!"

"Yes." The expert called Xu Chou rose and walked out.

At these words everyone perked up, realizing the leader was planning for the near future, and their expectations silently rose.
