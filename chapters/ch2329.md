## Chapter 2329 — All Means Unleashed

These wicked cultivators have an insatiable obsession with exhuming experts' graves, since every corpse of a powerful martial artist becomes a valuable resource in their hands. Precisely because of this, such practitioners are universally despised wherever they appear. The art of refining Corpse Puppets is the most forbidden of techniques—an absolute taboo that none are permitted to touch.

Yet even so, such occurrences can never be truly eradicated. No matter the era or the place, there are always those who defy the world’s condemnation and walk the path against Heaven’s will.

Yang Kai never expected that in a sect like Chiyue Sect someone would dare to dabble in the art of refining Corpse Puppets.

It would be one thing if the Corpse King before him were merely mindless; the key was the array patterns and diagrams covering its body, along with its obviously metal-mixed physique. At a glance, it was clear this person had been refined into a Corpse Puppet!

And it was an Emperor Realm-level Corpse Puppet!

Who could possibly have refined such a powerful martial artist into a mindless Corpse Puppet? Yang Kai was utterly shaken.

But he quickly realized something was wrong, because according to Ye Hen and Ye Qinghan, the Sect Master of Chiyue Sect from that generation had entered this secret realm alone, and then the entrance was sealed. In other words, for tens of thousands of years, apart from that Sect Master, no one else had been here.

Yang Kai also found no trace of a second person’s presence.

Moreover, that generation’s Sect Master of Chiyue Sect was a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert. Who could possibly have had the power to refine him into a Corpse Puppet?

Could it be... he refined himself into a puppet?

The moment this thought arose, Yang Kai was startled. If that were true, it would mean that generation’s Sect Master of Chiyue Sect had reached unparalleled mastery in the Dao of Puppetry, and possessed a will and determination beyond ordinary men.

After all, just thinking about refining oneself into a puppet was chilling. How much unbearable pain must one endure throughout the process?

Yet for some unknown reason, that generation’s Sect Master of Chiyue Sect seemed to have failed, resulting in his death here, and his corpse gradually became what now stood before them.

Although this was only Yang Kai’s speculation, he felt it was not far from the truth.

As his thoughts raced, the Corpse Puppet, whose expression had been flickering and struggling, suddenly turned its head to look in Yang Kai’s direction. Its ghostly eyes burst forth with a chilling light.

Yang Kai’s heart sank. The puppet seemed to have broken free from some restraint and was about to strike him down.

Before his thoughts could even finish, the Corpse Puppet flickered and appeared before him, swinging its terrifying fist at Yang Kai once more.

Yang Kai’s soul nearly fled his body. Although the Corpse Puppet had no intelligence and its fighting style was extremely monotonous, only knowing how to smash with its fists, sheer force could overcome all skill. With just one punch, Yang Kai was already unable to resist.

The intent behind that punch was ferocious, perfectly demonstrating the might of the Emperor Realm. The vortex of power was almost visible to the naked eye, as if it would shatter the sky and turn the universe upside down.

Yang Kai’s scalp tingled. He shouted, “Dragon Transformation!”

In the next instant, a high and mighty dragon’s roar resounded. A golden dragon-shaped phantom appeared behind him, and with a shake of its head and tail, it rushed into his body. Cracking sounds rang out as Yang Kai’s arms instantly transformed into dragon claws, his exposed skin covered in sturdy dragon scales. Not only that, but his spine suddenly emitted explosive sounds, pure dragon aura spreading out, his backbone like a great dragon about to soar to the heavens.

Yang Kai had pushed the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique to its limit!

He had refined dragon scales, Dragon Bone, and Dragon Pearl—the three great Secret Treasures of the dragon body. Coupled with his already formidable physique, his strength soared in an instant.

And that wasn’t all. While performing Dragon Transformation, Yang Kai also activated the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi. In a flash, multicolored radiance blossomed on his body, the power of the five elements surged forth, and he crossed his hands before him in a defensive stance.

He didn’t dare attack at all. In the face of such overwhelming power, Yang Kai felt like a lone boat tossed in a storm, battered by fierce winds and waves, ready to capsize at any moment.

Boom...

The Corpse Puppet’s fist crashed down. Yang Kai felt as if struck by lightning, his whole body shuddered, and a crisp crack sounded from his arms—both dragon claw-like wrists were broken, twisted out of shape. At the same time, a powerful force sent his body flying, worsening his already unhealed injuries.

And this was after he had used both Dragon Transformation and Undying Five Elements Sword Qi to defend with all his might.

If he had been struck without any defense, Yang Kai reckoned he would have been reduced to dust in an instant.

He had fully experienced the might of the Corpse Puppet before him.

While tumbling through the air, Yang Kai gritted his teeth against the piercing pain and shouted, “Come out!”

As soon as he spoke, a massive figure like a mountain descended from the sky, landing with a thunderous crash that shook the earth.

The Incarnation made a shocking entrance!

The moment he appeared, before he could even figure out where he was or what danger Yang Kai was facing, his whole body stiffened. He could feel the violent aura radiating from the Corpse Puppet, so powerful it nearly crushed his fighting spirit.

But every time he appeared, it was when Yang Kai faced a formidable enemy, so his shock lasted only a moment before he recovered. Reaching into the void, he caught the tumbling Yang Kai in his palm.

“Cough, cough...” Yang Kai half-knelt in the Incarnation’s palm, blood spilling from his lips as he coughed again and again, his face growing paler with each breath.

“Master!” Liu Yan also appeared alongside the Incarnation. At the sight of Yang Kai’s miserable state, her beautiful face paled, and she immediately rushed to his side to help him up with concern.

“What the hell is that thing!” The Incarnation’s eyes widened as he stared in shock at the source below, so tiny as an ant yet so formidable he dared not underestimate it. His voice even trembled slightly.

“Corpse Puppet!” Yang Kai stood up and explained, “A Third Stage Emperor Realm-level Corpse Puppet!”

“What?” The Incarnation and Liu Yan both changed color, their souls violently shaken. After a long daze, the Incarnation said bitterly, “How did you provoke such a monster?”

“It’s a long story...” Yang Kai’s mouth twitched as he shook his wrists. With two crisp cracks, his dislocated wrists snapped back into place. Looking down, he saw the flesh on his wrists had split open, exposing the white bone beneath. It was clear how much damage the Corpse Puppet’s punch had caused.

Fortunately, with the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique and the Undying Five Elements Sword active at the same time, coupled with his already formidable physique and the powerful regenerative properties of his Golden Blood, such injuries were still not enough to hinder him.

“It’s coming!” the Incarnation suddenly shouted. As he spoke, the Corpse Puppet leapt from its spot, charging at the Incarnation and swinging a fist at him.

Compared to the Incarnation, the Corpse Puppet’s figure was like a blade of grass before a great tree, utterly insignificant.

Yet that punch made the Incarnation treat it with utmost seriousness, not daring to underestimate it in the slightest.

In that split second, he also swung his fist forward.

The massive fist and the tiny figure collided, producing a thunderous roar. The explosive force sent gales raging in all directions.

The Incarnation’s mountain-like body was sent flying, flailing awkwardly through the air.

As for the Corpse Puppet, after taking the Incarnation’s direct blow, it was clearly not unscathed. At even greater speed than the Incarnation, it crashed into the mountainside and vanished in the blink of an eye.

Moments later, a loud boom rang out as the mountainside was smashed into a human-shaped pit. The Corpse Puppet was embedded within, and from its center, countless cracks spread like a spiderweb, stones tumbling down.

Yang Kai gasped in disbelief at what he saw.

He knew better than anyone how strong the Incarnation was. The Incarnation had been born from fusing an entire Floating Continent. Though the Floating Continent wasn’t huge, it already possessed the power of a world and its own source.

In other words, every strike from the Incarnation was the power of a world.

With his current strength, even an Emperor Realm expert would be instantly killed by a direct hit, yet the Corpse Puppet, after taking such a blow, was barely damaged—just embedded in the mountainside.

How tough must the Corpse Puppet’s body be?

Not only that, but its blow had even sent the Incarnation flying — a force that could destroy heaven and earth.

“Liu Yan!” Yang Kai shouted.

He didn’t even need to give orders. Liu Yan already knew what to do. Her delicate body spun, instantly transforming into a Fire Bird. Spreading her wings, she swooped at the Corpse Puppet, let out a crisp cry, and unleashed blazing flames at it.

Liu Yan’s flames were extremely complex, containing her own Earth Core Fire, Qiantian Thunderflame, Kunlan Blue Ice Flame, Sun’s True Fire, and many other wondrous fires. There was even the World-Ending Black Flame of the Divine Spirit Luanfeng mixed in.

Her flames were supremely dangerous.

With a single breath, the mountainside melted into red magma, steaming and sliding downward.

The Incarnation’s world-shaking punch hadn’t fazed the Corpse Puppet, but Liu Yan’s flames seemed to inflict real damage. Amid the blazing fire, deep roars and howls soon rang out, as if in great pain.

Suddenly, a furious howl erupted, and a beam of green light shot from the flames, pushing forward against the fire.

Yang Kai was shocked. He saw the Corpse Puppet spit out corpse poison, contending with Liu Yan’s flames and even gaining the upper hand.

For a moment, the green corpse poison and the red flames clashed in midair, locked in a stalemate.

But Yang Kai knew this was only a temporary illusion. Once the Corpse Puppet broke free, Liu Yan would be no match. Though she had experienced many wonders following him, her strength was what it was. A Third Stage of the Emperor Realm-level Corpse Puppet, even without intelligence, was not something she could handle.

Yang Kai secretly rejoiced that the Corpse Puppet had lost all reason. Otherwise, with its cultivation and mastery of divine abilities in life, the three of them together would not survive even a single move.
