## Chapter 2189 — Maturity

"Hmph! Xia Sheng, your words may sound like you're playing the good guy after taking advantage, but that's exactly what I wanted to say," Wuchang snorted. "I, Wuchang, owe nothing to Heaven or Earth, and I don't intend to owe anyone a favor either!"

Zhuang Bufan smiled and said, "Your Highness, what is yours is yours. There's no need to decline!"

For a moment, Lan Xun couldn't help but feel both amused and exasperated.

Yang Kai, wiping the cold sweat from his brow, said, "Listening to you all, it sounds like I absolutely must succeed in refining that batch of Supreme Mystic Pills. Otherwise, wouldn't I be letting down Her Highness's painstaking efforts?"

"What, you lack confidence?" Lan Xun raised her delicate brows and asked.

"It's not that I lack confidence," Yang Kai smiled slightly. "It's just... no Alchemist can guarantee absolute success when refining Pills. Just in case, let me ask—if I fail, what then?"

"We'll kill you!" Wuchang looked at him coldly and said.

"The pressure is immense," Yang Kai's forehead was drenched in cold sweat.

Lan Xun smiled and said, "Just do your best."

As she spoke, she handed her Azure-Blood Ganoderma to Yang Kai. After inspecting it, Yang Kai nodded, "There's no problem with Your Highness's stalk. Its medicinal age is at least eight thousand years, more than enough for refining. Also... judging by its color and the marks from picking, it doesn't seem to be something obtained from Four Seasons Land."

"That's right, I brought it with me. It's been in my Spatial Ring for years," Lan Xun replied.

"Alright, now that all the materials are gathered," Yang Kai said, stuffing the Azure-Blood Ganoderma into his own Spatial Ring without further ado. He looked around and declared, "Do you all want me to refine another batch of Dao Origin-Grade Spiritual Pills to prove my ability?" He paused, then continued, "Let me be clear, I can do it if you want proof. But you all know, alchemy is exhausting. If I fail to refine the Supreme Mystic Pills because of this, I won't be held responsible!"

As soon as he finished, everyone frowned.

Because what Yang Kai said was indeed true.

If everyone wanted him to prove his ability, he would have to refine a batch of Dao Origin-Grade Spiritual Pills! But doing so would greatly deplete his energy and spirit, and in a day, the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus would mature. At that time, Yang Kai would have to start refining again. In other words, he would have to refine two batches of Spiritual Pills within two days. Such high-intensity alchemy would be too much for any Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist.

Not being in peak condition would definitely affect the refinement of the Supreme Mystic Pills.

"In my opinion, there's no need for that..." Lan Xun smiled slightly. "The only reason for that suggestion earlier was because we weren't sure if Brother Yang was really an Alchemist. But now, I think everyone can be certain. If Brother Yang weren't an Alchemist, how could he know the formula for the Supreme Mystic Pill, or determine the medicinal age of the Azure-Blood Ganoderma in such a short time?"

"Her Highness is right!" Zhuang Bufan nodded. "Just from the fact that Brother Yang was already preparing alchemy materials before we arrived, it's beyond doubt that he's a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist. Brother Yang, just rest well. When the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus matures tomorrow, you can begin refining!"

"Since you all say so, I'll get some rest!" Yang Kai immediately went along, sat down without further ado, and closed his eyes to rest!

Although some people were still suspicious, with Lan Xun and Zhuang Bufan's words, even if they had doubts, they didn't dare voice them. They could only wait for tomorrow, when everything would become clear.

The scene quieted down instantly.

The cultivators who had come here each found a spot, sat cross-legged, and tried to restore themselves to peak condition.

Because everyone knew very well—if Yang Kai failed in his refinement, then so be it; at worst, he alone would bear the disappointment and wrath of the crowd. But if he succeeded, after giving Lan Xun her promised Supreme Mystic Pill, the remaining pills would be up for grabs, and it would be every man for himself!

In the face of such a great opportunity, even with Wuchang, Xia Sheng, Zhuang Bufan, Xiao Chen, and others blocking the way, no one would back down!

If they missed this chance, many of them would never reach the Emperor Realm in their entire lives! But if they could seize this opportunity, countless cultivators might advance ahead of time.

Even the places where everyone chose to rest seemed carefully considered, unconsciously surrounding the area where Yang Kai and the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus were, as if to prevent him from escaping.

Especially Wuchang, who had no intention of resting at all. He just sat there cross-legged, staring intently at Yang Kai. If Yang Kai made any move, he would react instantly!

This was also the main reason everyone agreed to let Yang Kai refine the Supreme Mystic Pills instead of trying to seize the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus now!

There was only one Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus! No one was confident they could seize it, not even the arrogant Wuchang.

Rather than fighting a hopeless battle, it was better to let Yang Kai refine the pills. Then, their chances would greatly increase. And with Yang Kai's mere First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, under so many watchful eyes, there was no way he could escape after refining.

Everyone understood this perfectly, so they waited confidently for tomorrow, letting Yang Kai refine the Supreme Mystic Pills!

"Senior Brother, things don't look good," Xiao Baiyi suddenly leaned over to Xia Sheng during their rest, sending a Divine Sense transmission.

"I know!" Xia Sheng replied calmly. "Don't worry, I've made arrangements. After Brother Yang succeeds tomorrow, we can help him break through the encirclement and escape to the exit. The Junior Brothers and Sisters are waiting there."

"No wonder I haven't seen anyone else arrive. So they're all waiting at the exit?" Xiao Baiyi looked suddenly enlightened.

Xia Sheng grinned and replied, "How could a treasure like the Supreme Mystic Pills fall into the hands of other sects? When the time comes, just have Brother Yang cooperate."

"What if he doesn't cooperate?" Xiao Baiyi asked.

"Beat him up! Knock him out and take him away," Xia Sheng replied.

Xiao Baiyi twitched his mouth awkwardly, "I'm no match for him!"

"What?" Xia Sheng turned, staring at Xiao Baiyi in shock. "Xiao Bai, when did you become so lacking in confidence? Brother Yang really did defeat Xue Yi, which is impressive. If you and I were at his cultivation, we might not be able to do the same. But he's still far below us."

"There's something I'm ashamed to admit!" Xiao Baiyi suddenly grew serious.

"What is it?"

"In the Time Temple, I fought him," Xiao Baiyi said. "The result... I lost."

"Are you kidding me?" Xia Sheng's eyes nearly popped out.

"How could I joke about something so humiliating?" Xiao Baiyi said solemnly. "And in my opinion, it's not just me—Zhuang Bufan isn't his match either."

"What... do you mean!" After asking, Xia Sheng immediately glanced thoughtfully at where Zhuang Bufan was, exclaiming, "You mean... before we arrived, those two fought, and Zhuang Bufan lost?"

"Ten to one!"

"How is that possible?"

Xiao Baiyi sneered, "Nothing's impossible. Why do you think Zhuang Bufan kept speaking up for Yang Kai just now?"

Xia Sheng frowned, "You mean Yang Kai held back earlier, so Zhuang Bufan..."

"What other reason could there be?" Xiao Baiyi retorted.

"Hiss..." Xia Sheng couldn't help but suck in a breath, muttering, "Those two fought before, I knew that, but I thought Yang Kai lost... He's only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, how could he manage that?"

"Who knows. He's even a Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist—can you believe it?"

Xia Sheng's mouth twitched, and he said no more.

After a long while, he straightened up and said, "Alright, I'll negotiate with Brother Yang when the time comes. I believe he won't refuse. If he wants to survive, he'll have to cooperate with us."

"Let's hope so..." Xiao Baiyi replied uncertainly.

While these two from Qingyang Shrine were secretly conversing, most of the other cultivators were doing the same, forming alliances with those they knew to prepare for the strong enemies. As for what to do if they actually seized the Supreme Mystic Pills, that was a problem for later.

For most cultivators, the urgent matter now was how to snatch the Supreme Mystic Pills from those few top Dao Origin Realm experts.

Time passed slowly.

Yang Kai raced against time to restore his strength.

Refining the Supreme Mystic Pills was also a test for him, so he had to face it in peak condition. Any mistake could lead to failure.

If he failed, he would become the target of everyone's anger. By then, no matter how capable he was, he wouldn't be able to withstand their wrath.

The strange movements around him, the constant Divine Sense exchanges, and even Wuchang's unblinking stare couldn't affect him. His mind gradually calmed and became clear.

Under immense pressure, he entered a wondrous state.

The fragrance of medicine filled the air, and halos of light shimmered.

The heavenly phenomenon became more pronounced, with multicolored clouds in the sky appearing and vanishing.

The pure white petals of the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus also began to bloom...

At a certain moment, the world buzzed, Spiritual Qi trembled, and all the heavenly phenomena converged into a terrifying energy that poured down from the sky like a funnel, pouring into the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus.

The fragile Spiritual Medicine, after withstanding such an infusion, was not damaged at all. Instead, it became even more wondrous.

Grain-sized runes suddenly appeared around the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, containing profound mysteries.

Between Heaven and Earth, faint celestial music sounded, like morning bells and evening drums, invigorating the spirit. Under everyone's gaze, the petals of the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus finally bloomed completely!

An even richer fragrance drifted everywhere, invigorating those who inhaled it. The enticing aroma made people want to rush up and eat the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, to savor its wonder!

As if pulled by invisible strings, many cultivators cast greedy eyes at the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus. Some even looked ready to make a move!
