## Chapter 699 — Fuyun City

A full month after leaving Tianxiao Sect, the party at last set foot in the Neutral Domain of the Tongxuan Continent.

The so‑called Neutral Domain was a region where humans, demons, and the yao coexisted — a scene impossible to see elsewhere.

The moment he entered, Yang Kai sensed streams of unusual energies flowing through the air.

There were traces of demonic qi he recognized, and another obscure, indistinct force that must be yao qi. These demonic and yao energies could not be absorbed by human warriors; they were the nourishment the demons and yao needed to grow powerful.

Cang Yan and the others immediately grew even more vigilant.

The Neutral Domain was more chaotic than any other place; a single misstep could lead to inevitable ruin.

After several more days of travel, the group finally saw a colossal, cloud-piercing mountain peak.

Dozens of li from the base of that peak stood a city — their destination, Fuyun City.

Cang Yan quickened his pace, and half a day later they reached Fuyun City.

Having paid a sufficient sum of Crystal Stone, the group entered the city together.

Yang Kai could clearly feel that Cang Yan and the others had relaxed their guard.

Du Wan smiled faintly and said, “Once inside the city there won’t be much danger. Fuyun City is jointly governed by the human, yao, and demon races, and the city lord is a Saint Realm expert; no one who comes here dares act too wantonly.”

“Which race does the city lord belong to?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“I’m not exactly sure. Fuyun City changes its city lord every three years; the experts of the three races decide the lord through bouts on the arena. It is precisely by using such a method that the city’s peace is maintained — if one race were allowed to grow dominant forever, the other two would have no place left.”

Cang Yan smiled and continued, “As far as I know, the current city lord is a demon expert. Rest assured, when matters concern the stability of the three races he will not act recklessly. If the Neutral Domain were to fall into great disorder, then this entire continent would truly be thrown into chaos.”

“This old man and Mi Na will go to the local Alchemists' Association,” Du Wan said. “Cang Yan, will you come with us?”

“We’ll pass.” Cang Yan shook his head. “Alchemists are a proud lot; they won’t care whether someone is from Tianxiao Sect. If we go to the Alchemists' Association we’ll likely be met with cold stares. With my temper I might well quarrel with them, and that would make things awkward for Elder Du.”

Looking at Yang Kai, Cang Yan said, “Junior nephew, if you wish to go you can join Elder Du. When the time comes I’ll come find you.”

Mi Na chimed in, “Yes, yes — you’re an alchemist; it makes sense for you to come with us.”

She clearly wanted to stay with Yang Kai and continue learning alchemy from him.

Fei Yu pursed her lips and teased with a playful laugh, “The little girl is so forward — has she taken a fancy to my junior nephew?”

Mi Na flushed and snapped, “Don’t be ridiculous. I wouldn’t fall for that bastard.”

Yang Kai gave an astonished chuckle and shook his head, “No thanks. I’ll stay with the senior aunt and uncles.”

Du Wan nodded lightly. “I won’t force you. Young friend Yang, come over here.” He beckoned.

Yang Kai, puzzled, stepped forward. “Elder Du, what do you wish?”

Du Wan smiled and slipped a small mirror box into his hand. “This thing I acquired years ago; you should find use for it on this trip. And best to make use of it soon.”

Yang Kai eyed the mirror box suspiciously. “What is it?”

“You’ll see when the time comes.” Elder Du smiled mysteriously and led Mi Na toward the Alchemists' Association.

After Elder Du left, Cang Yan said, “Let us find an inn and settle for the night.”

Fei Yu leaned close to Yang Kai and asked softly, “What did Elder Du give you?”

“I don’t know either.” Yang Kai shook his head.

In an inn, Cang Yan managed to secure two upper rooms. Because Fuyun City awaited the blooming of the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, guests were everywhere; those two upper rooms were scraped together with great difficulty by the innkeeper.

After discussion they decided Fei Yu would share a room with Yang Kai, while the remaining three would share the other room.

Yang Kai had no objection; he was used to living with Fei Yu. Though she was a woman, the difference in seniority put the matter beyond reproach.

After a flurry of activity, everyone finally settled.

Yang Kai sat cross-legged with the mirror box in his hands, his expression odd.

He had not expected Elder Du to hand him such an item the moment they entered Fuyun City.

“Open it, I’m curious what treasure Elder Du would give you,” Fei Yu said with a teasing smile.

Yang Kai nodded, about to open it, then gave a helpless smile and said softly, “You should all come over.”

Next door Li Wan and Fei Jian, who had been listening, were embarrassed; Li Wan sniffed and declared righteously, “This junior nephew is too disrespectful to his seniors. I’ll go over and teach him a lesson.”

Fei Jian trailed obediently after him.

Cang Yan shook his head and followed with a look of helplessness.

In the room they gathered, all eyes fixed on the mirror box in Yang Kai’s hands; they were clearly eager to see what was inside.

Under their watch Yang Kai opened the mirror box and pulled out something as thin as cicada wings.

The object was made of an unknown material, icy to the touch, and bore several holes in particular positions; at first glance it resembled a face peeled from a human, eerie and ghastly.

Cang Yan’s expression shifted. “I see! Elder Du is meticulous indeed.”

“This is used to change one’s appearance, right?” Yang Kai also recognized its purpose.

“Put it on and see.” Fei Yu urged.

Yang Kai nodded and pressed the thin facial veil over his face. The next moment he felt something crawling across his features, seeping into his skin — cold and oddly pleasant.

He did not know exactly how his appearance had changed, but from the expressions on his four seniors’ faces he could tell the difference must be dramatic.

Li Wan’s mouth opened wide in disbelief.

Fei Jian’s eyes likewise bulged.

“Is the change really that great?” Yang Kai sneered.

“See for yourself!” Fei Yu waved her hand and formed a mirror of water. Yang Kai glanced into it and was instantly stunned.

The visage reflected in the mirror was that of a complete stranger — a wholly different style, exceptionally handsome, the skin pale and delicate as a woman’s.

“How did I become a pretty boy?” Yang Kai said with a rueful expression. He pinched his face and the image in the mirror mirrored the motion perfectly.

“Incredible!” Cang Yan could not help but praise. “This Secret Treasure is truly extraordinary — not only has it altered your face, it has even changed your life aura!”

“With this we needn’t fear exposure,” Fei Yu smiled. “We must thank Elder Du; I’ve been worrying about this since we set out.”

Since Yang Kai would be going to Wangtian Cliff to refine the elixir from the Thousand-Year Demon Flower, he would inevitably attract attention. If he performed too outstandingly and drew eyes, it would be dangerous.

Elder Du’s gift perfectly solved that problem.

Simple disguise techniques were something Cang Yan and the others could perform, enough to alter Yang Kai’s appearance, but they were easily pierced by strong opponents and could not change his life aura.

Now there was no need to worry.

Even if Yang Kai acted conspicuously and drew attention, it would not matter, for the world would not be seeing Yang Kai himself.

“Elder Du truly has many good things,” Cang Yan murmured. “Last time he produced a Lianqing Stone that can only be found in the starry heavens; now this powerful disguise — alchemists really are a rich lot.”

Especially the high‑level alchemists; if they wanted something done they needn’t lift a finger — they’d merely put out word and the warriors who wanted their pills would see to it.

Whether it was the Lianqing Stone or this Secret Treasure, these must be rewards Elder Du had accumulated over years of refining pills for others.

“This junior nephew looks much more pleasing now,” Fei Yu laughed coquettishly. “I always like a pretty boy.”

The previous Yang Kai, while not ugly, had a harsh, rugged air honed by years of struggle that made him increasingly compelling and heroic.

Now he was truly astonishingly handsome, his beauty almost bewitching — a visage that could win the favor of any woman.

Yang Kai’s face remained composed. After a moment’s thought he circulated True Yuan into his face; the features rippled and shifted slightly until his appearance altered a bit further.

“That’s perfect.” He nodded in satisfaction after looking into the mirror.

“Why change it? The former look was so handsome,” Fei Yu pouted. “This is fine, but it’s not as good as before.”

“Flawlessness is the greatest flaw,” Yang Kai shook his head. “This looks more natural.”

Hearing him, Fei Yu pondered and after a moment nodded in agreement.

“Very well. We’ll have to properly thank Elder Du another day. With this at hand we can act with abandon.” Cang Yan drew a deep breath. “Tomorrow Li Wan, Fei Jian and I will fly over to Wangtian Cliff to scout the situation. Time is short; many will likely make the same choice, so it’s wise to reconnoiter in advance. Fei Yu, you and the junior nephew stay in the city and keep him safe. Fuyun City may be relatively secure, but that doesn’t mean there won’t be conflicts.”

“Understood.” Fei Yu nodded solemnly.

The group returned to their respective rooms to rest.

Yang Kai did not remove the disguise Secret Treasure; he kept it on to become familiar with its properties.

Night fell over Fuyun City, and suddenly an odd pair descended: an old man with white hair, bent and decrepit, followed by a young man who looked only about twenty. Yet that young man’s eyes were exceptionally alert as he curiously scanned the bustling city.

The old man observed in turn, and after a long while a faint light passed through his dim eyes as if memory had been stirred; he remained silent for a long time.
