## Chapter 1821 — Devouring Spirit Sect

Steadying his mind, the youth called out, “Two friends, may I ask your family names and titles?”

Once he learned that Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor were not to be trifled with, he immediately lowered his posture and no longer carried the same fierce air as before.

No sooner had his words fallen than a figure flashed before him; the man who had earlier fallen from the sky suddenly stood in front of him. His sullen face looked as if it might drip with malice and was almost pressed against his own. Meeting his gaze, the youth felt a prickle of panic in his chest and staggered back repeatedly.

“Who are you, and where did you come from?” Yang Kai asked coldly.

Among the black-clad men here, only two were at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; the others were cultivators of the Saint King Realm, beings Yang Kai did not even bother to look at.

What he most wanted to learn now was their origin and how they had arrived on the Tongxuan Continent.

The two Origin Returning Realm men guarding the youth likewise had not seen how Yang Kai had come into view, and they immediately realized this man was far more terrifying than they had guessed. One of them mustered his courage and, smiling nervously, offered, “In reply to this Young Master, we are members of the Devouring Spirit Sect. This here is our Devouring Spirit Sect’s Young Sect Master, Mu Chengfeng!”

As he spoke he pointed at the youth and introduced him to Yang Kai.

Mu Chengfeng puffed out his chest, as if aware his earlier behavior had been disgraceful and trying to act composed to salvage a little face.

“Devouring Spirit Sect?” Yang Kai frowned and glanced at Ghost Ancestor.

“I have never heard of that sect either; it’s likely insignificant,” Ghost Ancestor said lightly.

Hearing Ghost Ancestor’s assessment of their sect, Mu Chengfeng and the two Origin Returning Realm cultivators felt choked with anger, but their fists were no match for the other side and they dared not be too presumptuous.

“Was this spirit formation made by you?” Yang Kai pointed behind him to the six-pointed star array.

“It is…” The Origin Returning Realm who had spoken earlier hurriedly answered, wiping the cold sweat from his brow. “It was our sect that expended considerable effort to set it up.”

“Good!” Yang Kai sneered. “Since it was your doing, then—”

“Young Brother!” Sensing what Yang Kai was about to say next, the Origin Returning Realm cultivator interrupted him in fright. “Please understand, Young Brother — this kind of formation isn’t the only one on this continent. All disciples of my Devouring Spirit Sect are here under the leadership of our Sect Master, working toward a great undertaking. I beg you to show some mercy.”

“Not unique?” Yang Kai’s expression turned dark. He laughed with fury, “No wonder the Spiritual Qi here is worse than before — it was you lot doing this. Very well, very good.”

The Origin Returning Realm forced a smile. “Young Brother, you can’t say it like that. The cultivators on this continent are too weak; even if they retained the Spiritual Qi to cultivate, they would never achieve much in their lifetimes. If the Devouring Spirit Sect were to take this Spiritual Qi, it would be different — our Sect Master is a Void King Realm expert. If he can devour the continent’s Spiritual Qi, his power will surely increase. Once he refines the continent’s Stellar Origin, he can bring a shred of hope to this place. It is a case of risking death to gain new life. Young Brother, with your profound strength you should understand this principle.”

He deliberately name-dropped that the Devouring Spirit Sect Master was a Void King Realm expert to deter Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s anger only rose after hearing that. “You plan to refine the Stellar Origin?” he demanded.

Mu Chengfeng straightened his waist. “My father has already led the sect’s elite to the earth’s core; I fear they will begin refining the Origin soon.”

Thinking of his father as a Void King Realm expert, Mu Chengfeng felt bolstered with confidence.

He was certain those two would not dare to kill him — though Mu Chengfeng still didn’t know their background or true strength. Any sensible person would avoid making enemies of a Void King Realm expert.

So he regained his previous air of easy confidence.

After he finished speaking, he found Yang Kai staring at him with an even more terrifying gaze. Mu Chengfeng was startled and cried out, “What are you doing?”

Yang Kai grinned grimly. “What else? I’m going to take your life.”

At his words came several hissing sounds, and all the black-clad Devouring Spirit Sect disciples suffered grievous injuries at the same moment and collapsed — none had time even to scream; all were dead.

“Ah!” Mu Chengfeng screamed in terror; his eyes trembled violently and, shaking, he pointed at Yang Kai. “You… you dare oppose my Devouring Spirit Sect!”

“Oppose?” Yang Kai sneered. “Don’t overestimate yourselves. You don’t have that qualification. You dared act wantonly on my turf; I’ll make sure you never return.”

The Devouring Spirit Sect not only brazenly siphoned the Tongxuan Continent’s Spiritual Qi and enslaved the continent’s cultivators, but they had also set their sights on the Stellar Origin — how could Yang Kai not be furious?

Although the Stellar Origin had already been taken by Little Senior Sister and was not in danger of falling into the Devouring Spirit Sect’s hands, their wanton actions still harmed Little Senior Sister.

“My father is a Void King Realm expert — you dare kill me?” Mu Chengfeng was stunned, thinking his father’s name would cow them, but he had not expected the youth to not care in the least.

“Void King Realm? I’ve killed more than one of that rank. I’ll go and take your father’s head myself!” Yang Kai sneered and advanced toward Mu Chengfeng.

Mu Chengfeng fell backward onto his rear, excreting a foul stench from his groin; his face contorted and he nearly sobbed.

Yang Kai frowned; he had not expected this boy to be such a coward. He waved his hand and unleashed a Saint Yuan, sealing off Mu Chengfeng’s power, then looked back at the thousand or so Tianmu Palace cultivators and said, “Whoever wants to kill him, come on up.”

The thousand cultivators had been maintaining the Devouring Spirit array; after Yang Kai and Ghost Ancestor appeared they had only been watching. Seeing Yang Kai casually destroy the Devouring Spirit Sect disciples who were helpless to resist, they immediately regarded Yang Kai as a marvel.

Some had even seen portraits of Yang Kai and at once understood his background and identity.

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s words, there was no longer any hesitation; the thousand people — old and young, men and women alike — surged toward Mu Chengfeng with killing intent on their faces.

“You lot… you ants…” Mu Chengfeng feared Yang Kai but showed no mercy to these Tianmu Palace cultivators, snarling, “If you dare harm a single hair on me, I will make sure you can neither live nor die!”

The thousand people paused for a heartbeat, then charged with even greater speed.

In the blink of an eye Mu Chengfeng’s position was surrounded so tightly not even water could seep through.

Sounds of fists and boots hitting flesh rang out. The Tianmu Palace disciples in the center seemed to agree not to use Saint Yuan and instead attacked Mu Chengfeng with their bodies, so he could suffer longer and taste more pain.

“That bastard killed our Sect Master — avenge the Sect Master!”

“Avenge the Seventh Elder!”

“Avenge Senior Sister Liu… sob, Senior Sister Liu, can you see this from the heavens? I avenge you.”

“Move aside, let me kick these damn balls into pieces!”

A thousand people ganging up on one was a spectacular sight. Dust flew around Mu Chengfeng as the sound of blows continued, interspersed with his anguished screams.

But before long Mu Chengfeng’s cries grew weaker, and after a while all sound ceased.

“Are you… Saint Lord Yang? Are you truly Saint Lord Yang?” A woman’s voice sounded by Yang Kai’s ear as he looked on coldly.

Yang Kai turned to look and saw the woman who had earlier been dragged out by Mu Chengfeng to be shamed. Her face was gray and she looked like a bedraggled flower; the torn wide robe still hung on her. Her figure was still proud and alluring, making her resemble a small grass battered by wind and rain, arousing pity.

“You know me?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“You really are Saint Lord Yang?” The woman’s face flushed, and she stared at Yang Kai dumbfounded. Her two expressive eyes shone brightly and tears quickly filled her rims. As if seeing a savior, she fell to her knees before Yang Kai with a thud. “Saint Lord Yang, please uphold justice for the cultivators of the continent!”

“Stand and speak!” Yang Kai was taken aback and hastily raised a hand; the woman felt a gentle force lift her so she could not kneel again.

“Don’t cry!” Yang Kai felt a headache; the woman sobbed and looked at him through tear-streaked eyes, beads of tear like broken pearls kept streaming down her cheeks without pause.

Her clear features were gradually revealed.

As expected, she was an exceptionally beautiful woman. Though Mu Chengfeng was rather despicable, he had plenty of experience when it came to judging women.

“Speak plainly.” Yang Kai sighed and comforted, “Stop crying for now.”

“Yes!” The woman wiped her eyes hard and stifled her excitement. Her full bosom heaved exaggeratedly a few times, finally calming. “Saint Lord Yang is a man whose hands and eyes span the heavens; only you can lift the calamity afflicting the continent. Please, Saint Lord Yang, pity us and save the continent from fire and flood.”

A thunderous shout rose up around them: “Saint Lord Yang, pity us and save the continent from fire and flood!”

Yang Kai turned and saw that the thousand Tianmu Palace cultivators had gathered and looked at him with beseeching eyes.

On the other side, Mu Chengfeng had already been beaten into an unrecognizable mass of magled flesh.

Yang Kai scratched his nose awkwardly. “Don’t put it so gravely. I know a bit about the situation here, but I’ve just returned and don’t know much. Tell me more: what exactly is happening on the continent? When did these people arrive?”

“In reply to Saint Lord Yang, these people came to the Tongxuan Continent a year ago…” The woman parted her red lips and fell into recollection; as she spoke, the fear and anger in her eyes grew, clearly recalling a year of terror and their fellow disciples being slaughtered.
