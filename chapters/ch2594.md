## Chapter 2594 — Going Back on One’s Word

“This Lord is furious!” Shi Huo roared endlessly inside the Mountain and River Bell, causing it to buzz and tremble. “Brat, don’t you dare let this Lord escape, or you’ll be the first one I deal with!”

As soon as these words left his mouth, Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou’s faces all turned as black as the bottom of a pot.

Just now, Yang Kai had said he was afraid Shi Huo would come after him if he escaped, and now Shi Huo himself was saying it, swearing not to let Yang Kai off. How brainless did one have to be to say something like that?

“Shi Huo, enough with your nonsense!” Luan Feng couldn’t help but scold, afraid Shi Huo would say something truly irreparable.

Yang Kai pointed at the Mountain and River Bell with a look of terror and said, “Did you all hear that, sirs? With him like this, how could I dare remove the Soul Brand from the Mountain and River Bell? My life may not be worth much, but I don’t want to die for nothing!”

Fan Wu’s face was dark as he looked at Yang Kai and said, “Shi Huo’s temper is stubborn. It’s impossible to make him swear an oath, so don’t count on that. But he can at least promise not to trouble you after he’s freed.”

Yang Kai snorted, “You are you, he is he. How do you know what’s on his mind?”

Fan Wu turned to the Mountain and River Bell and said, “Shi Huo, give your word!”

There was a moment of silence inside the Mountain and River Bell before Shi Huo’s reluctant voice sounded, “Fine, this Lord won’t stoop to that brat’s level.”

“Well?” Fan Wu looked at Yang Kai again.

Yang Kai stroked his chin and gave a dry laugh, “It’s just words, nothing that matters. I still don’t feel safe. How about letting me take the Stone Spirit Race and leave a few thousand li away first...?”

“Absolutely impossible!” Fan Wu’s face showed impatience. “If you can’t accept this Lord’s terms, then Shi Huo will remain suppressed, and you... will stay here forever.”

Yang Kai was skilled in space powers. If he really got a few thousand li away, Fan Wu wasn’t confident he could stop him, so there was no way he’d agree.

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “No room for negotiation?”

Fan Wu slightly raised a hand. “You have three breaths to decide. After that, this Lord will kill you. Think carefully!”

Yang Kai gritted his teeth, humiliation written all over his face. He was rarely forced to such an extent, but today, he truly had no way out.

Fan Wu’s hand remained raised, his aura growing ever more dangerous.

Just as he was about to strike, Yang Kai let out a heavy sigh and said, “I agree.”

Fan Wu nodded slightly, not surprised at all. After all, no one would throw away their own life. He said blandly, “Release Shi Huo first.”

Yang Kai formed a seal, raised his hand, and the massive Mountain and River Bell began to hum, revealing Shi Huo’s figure, who had been suppressed inside. Black flames blazed on Shi Huo’s body, and his eyes were filled with boundless fury.

Yang Kai stayed on guard, ready to suppress Shi Huo again at the first sign of trouble. But last time he’d succeeded by luck; now that Shi Huo was prepared, his chances were slim.

Fortunately, Shi Huo only glared at him and snorted coldly, making no other move.

“Remove your Soul Brand,” Fan Wu urged.

Yang Kai withdrew the Mountain and River Bell, gazed at it reluctantly for a while, then sent out his Divine Sense, using a secret art to remove the Soul Brand from the bell.

On the small Mountain and River Bell, a flash of light appeared, and it suddenly became plain and unremarkable.

Yang Kai casually tossed it toward Fan Wu.

Fan Wu swept his sleeve to catch the Mountain and River Bell, but at the moment it landed in his hand, a tremendous force surged forth, and he failed to catch it.

With a boom, the Mountain and River Bell crashed to the ground, shaking the earth as if it had taken root, completely immovable.

“A true treasure of the Primordial Era, indeed!” A trace of shock flashed in Fan Wu’s eyes. Even now that the Mountain and River Bell was ownerless, he still couldn’t lift it. In this world, perhaps only its true master could wield it freely.

Suddenly, a violent wave of power surged.

“Shi Huo, what are you doing!” Luan Feng’s startled cry rang out at the same time.

Fan Wu’s expression changed as he looked up, only to see Shi Huo, grinning viciously, pounce at Yang Kai. His fist, wreathed in black flames, smashed down at Yang Kai as he shouted, “Die, brat!”

Yang Kai’s face changed dramatically. Even though he’d been wary of Shi Huo, he hadn’t expected this Saint Venerable to go back on his word and strike the moment the Soul Brand was removed.

In his haste, Yang Kai had no time to dodge.

That scorching power seemed able to melt dozens of zhang of space, and the massive fist could destroy the world.

Boom...

With a muffled groan, Yang Kai was smashed into the ground, vanishing without a trace.

“Roar!”

The Stone Spirits all roared in fury, their eyes nearly splitting. Especially the Incarnation, who watched helplessly as Yang Kai was smashed out of existence. Power surged within his massive body, but they were all restrained by the many Yao Kings and couldn’t break free.

“Shi Huo! Do you even know what you’re doing!” Luan Feng’s beautiful face was icy cold, as if it could freeze everything, and she shouted through gritted teeth.

Fan Wu and Cang Gou’s faces were also ugly.

They had just promised Yang Kai a way out, but Shi Huo had gone back on his word, blinded by rage and disregarding their reputation.

Now, how would their Yao Kings see them? How could they maintain their standing in the Ancient Land, where the highest powers were gathered and dozens of eyes were watching?

“It’s over, it’s over...”

Not far away, Xie Wuwei’s face turned pale, nearly collapsing to the ground.

Even though he was a Yao King whose strength rivaled the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, seeing this scene filled him with despair. He’d always worried for Yang Kai’s safety, and when Yang Kai reached an agreement with the Saint Venerables, he’d felt relieved. But he hadn’t expected Shi Huo to go back on his word and ambush a First Stage Emperor with the power of a Saint Venerable!

He was Yang Kai’s soul slave, his life tied to Yang Kai’s. If Yang Kai died, he couldn’t survive either.

Now it was truly over. Dragged to death by Yang Kai, Xie Wuwei’s face was full of grief and indignation. If he’d known, he’d rather have died in the Tomb of All Spirits, at least that was a resting place for the Ancient Land’s beings—he wouldn’t have died alone.

Now, he would die here for no reason, and there wouldn’t even be anyone left to collect my corpse.

But soon, Xie Wuwei realized something was wrong.

Because he wasn’t dead. In disbelief, he touched his body and could clearly feel his heartbeat. His eyes narrowed as he realized something, and he hurriedly looked toward the huge pit in the ground.

If he wasn’t dead, that meant Yang Kai wasn’t dead either.

But how could that be? How could he survive a sneak attack from a Saint Venerable?

“Shi Huo!” Fan Wu gritted his teeth and growled, his eyes cold. “He already removed the Soul Brand from the Mountain and River Bell as agreed. Why did you still try to kill him? Can’t you show even a little tolerance?”

“Tolerance?” Shi Huo snorted, the flames on his body gradually receding. “This Lord only knows to repay enmity with enmity and grudges with grudges. That brat dared to suppress this Lord with the Mountain and River Bell—he deserves to die!”

He turned and glanced at the other three Saint Venerables. “What, are you all going to fight this Lord for that brat? Don’t be ridiculous. He’s dead, and the dead are worthless.”

As shameless as his words were, it was true. What value did the dead have? Was it worth falling out with Shi Huo over Yang Kai?

“You shouldn’t have done this!” Fan Wu said coldly. He didn’t really care about Yang Kai’s death, but was angry at Shi Huo for breaking his word. At their level, a promise was worth more than life itself.

“Alright, alright.” Cang Gou stepped in to smooth things over. “What’s done is done. Blaming him is pointless. This was our mistake. As for this human... let’s give him a proper burial.”

To them, giving Yang Kai a proper burial was already a great honor...

Luan Feng nodded slightly and sighed, “This young man was a peerless genius. I’ll handle his burial myself—he won’t be mistreated.”

Fan Wu nodded and glared fiercely at Shi Huo, who stood there with a nonchalant expression, grinning, “I’ve vented my anger. Feels good!”

Just then, the Saint Venerables seemed to sense something and all turned to look in one direction.

Over there, a figure was rushing toward them at high speed. Judging by the silhouette, it seemed to be a woman, but her cultivation was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Closely following her was another figure at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm.

The two of them, one in front and one behind, sped over. The woman in front looked extremely anxious.

A group of little yao tried to intercept them from above, but were all beaten back by the Emperor Realm cultivator.

In a flash, the two figures had already arrived.

Swish, swish...

Both of them stopped in midair. The leading woman stared in disbelief at the huge pit below, tears streaming down like broken pearls.

The woman behind her was disheveled, her clothes tattered and dirty.

These two had charged into the gathering of yao, right up to the Four Great Saint Venerables, looking as if they didn’t know the meaning of death. Many of the yao couldn’t help but click their tongues in wonder.

“Ruoxi...” The Incarnation looked at the figure in midair, his expression pained as he sighed inwardly.

Ruoxi had rushed out like this because she’d seen Yang Kai ambushed by Shi Huo, so she’d thrown caution to the wind.

The one who came with Ruoxi was none other than the Third Disciple of the Ice Heart Valley.

The Third Disciple stood behind Ruoxi, her face fierce, making strange noises like a beast defending its territory, warning others not to approach.

But with just a single glare from Fan Wu, the Third Disciple shuddered all over and shrank back, curling herself into a ball.
