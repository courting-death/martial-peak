## Chapter 149 — Trial

Before she could finish her words, Hu Jiao’er interrupted, “So what if we approached you for this reason?”

She found it hard to accept that Yang Kai thought so poorly of them; did they really seem so scheming? How heartless and ungrateful of him.

Sensing her annoyance, Yang Kai chose to remain silent.

Hu Jiao’er continued, “Once that thing descends, we will follow you. After all, you know more than we do. You provide us with information, and I’ll protect you. How about that deal?”

“Protect me?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, glancing at her.

“With your current state, don’t you need protection? And your strength is so low; what if you encounter danger inside?” Hu Jiao’er chuckled lightly. “Don’t say that Su Yan from your Lingxiao Pavilion will protect you. She hasn’t even glanced at you these past few days; you saved her for nothing that day.”

“Do as you wish.” Yang Kai was unwilling to waste more words. In any case, they would all have to enter together, and having one more person would mean one more layer of protection.

“Hmph!” Hu Jiao’er snorted coldly, pulling her sister up and moving away from Yang Kai.

After waiting for another day, the object in the clouds finally revealed its full form, about to descend to the ground. Everyone stood up, staring blankly at the object ten miles away.

It could be described as a gigantic and majestic structure, but what caught everyone’s attention were the seemingly endless layers of steps.

At the very top, in the clouds, there seemed to be the shadow of a palace.

Is that where the inheritance is? Yang Kai let out a soft breath.

At the same time, many disciples from the three factions were also feeling excited and nervous. Although they didn’t know as much as Yang Kai, they had enough insight to realize that this colossal object must contain treasures, and everyone was just waiting for it to descend so they could rush in.

Under the eager gaze of countless people, the enormous structure finally made contact with the ground.

With a muffled sound, the earth trembled slightly, and the enormous vortex in the sky underwent a strange transformation before vanishing without a trace.

The muffled sound continued for a long time. Only then did everything settle down.

The structure had stabilized on the ground.

A shout came from among the disciples of the three factions, and hundreds of people suddenly moved, rushing toward that direction.

Yang Kai was also walking toward it, but unlike the others, he was not in a hurry. As the Earth Demon had said, the inheritance relied on fate, not speed.

In his line of sight, a pure white figure seemed to glide past. Looking up, it was Su Yan, her garments fluttering. Her pace was not fast, yet it was not slow either, as if she were strolling leisurely, exuding an air of nobility.

Noticing Yang Kai’s gaze, she turned her head to glance at him. Her long eyelashes fluttered slightly, as if she wanted to say something but held back. Yet, she said nothing.

In an instant, their gazes were separated by the figures of the disciples from the three factions.

A pair of fragrant breezes approached from either side, as the sisters from the Blood Battle Gang flanked Yang Kai, one smiling sweetly, the other casting a seductive glance.

The elder sister said, “I promised to protect you, and I will. Don’t worry, we sisters have already obtained a kind of inheritance. If there are any benefits this time, we won’t snatch them from you.”

When Yang Kai looked up again, Su Yan’s figure had vanished.

“Hey, you little brat! I’m talking to you!” Hu Jiao’er, not hearing Yang Kai’s response, couldn’t help but feel annoyed.

“I heard you.” Yang Kai replied helplessly.

“Hmph, I don’t know what’s so good about you.” Hu Jiao’er muttered softly, and Yang Kai couldn’t hear her clearly.

At a distance of ten miles, it wasn’t long before the three of them arrived at the resplendent staircase.

Next to this enormous structure, there was an additional layer of hazy light, and on that light, there was vaguely something resembling a door.

Disciples from the three factions, whether alone or in pairs, sought out the door and slipped into the light, quickly reducing their numbers.

Strangely enough, while standing before the light, they could see the scenes on the layers of steps clearly, yet all the disciples who entered through the light vanished without a trace, as if swallowed by an invisible mouth.

Seeing this scene, the sisters couldn’t help but feel a surge of anxiety.

“Yang Kai, where did they go?” Hu Jiao’er asked nervously.

“I don’t know.” Yang Kai shook his head, walking to an unoccupied door. He extended a hand, reaching inside, causing only a ripple, but he couldn’t see what was on the other side.

“Are we going in?” Hu Mei’er, feeling timid, was already trembling slightly.

Yang Kai looked up at the clouds and stepped directly into the door.

Seeing him so decisive, Hu Jiao’er bit her silver teeth and said, pulling her sister’s hand, “Let’s go!”

Upon entering the light, what they saw was just like the scene outside; it was the endless staircase stretching upward. Yang Kai, who had entered earlier, was standing at the bottom of the first step, lost in thought.

Looking around, there were indeed no signs of other people. It seemed that each door led to a separate space, and only those who entered through the same door would remain together.

Turning back, Yang Kai pressed his hand against the door, causing the ripple to spread, and the door on the light immediately vanished.

With no way back, Yang Kai took a deep breath and stepped onto the first step. Upon stepping on it, he couldn’t help but frown and stop.

“What’s wrong?” Hu Jiao’er asked.

“Come up and try it!” Yang Kai beckoned to the two sisters.

They didn’t hesitate, stepping forward, and as they stood beside Yang Kai, both sisters felt a slight tremor in their bodies.

“What do you feel?” Yang Kai asked.

“Energy is rushing into the soles of my feet.” Hu Jiao’er replied.

“Hot energy!” Hu Mei’er added.

“Hmm, this is probably the trial.” Yang Kai smiled faintly. Unlike the sisters, he discovered that the energy rushing into his feet was actually of the Yang attribute.

As the True Yang Technique operated, this energy not only caused him no harm but also replenished his Primordial Qi.

However, it was different for them; they had to use their techniques to dissipate the energy rushing into their feet. For him, it was a gain, while for them, it was a loss, making the disparity quite clear.

“However, this energy is too weak. If the trial is only this, it’s not worth mentioning.” Hu Mei’er said excitedly. With her strength at the second layer of the Open Origin Realm, she could easily withstand it.

“Don’t be careless.” Hu Jiao’er glanced at her sister. “This staircase has an unknown number of layers. If the energy we encounter increases as we go up, reaching the top might not be something we can handle.”

“Whether it is or not, we’ll find out by trying.” Yang Kai took another step, moving onto the second layer, then the third, fourth…

The sisters followed closely behind.

After walking through a hundred layers, the three of them realized that Hu Jiao’er’s earlier deduction was correct; the higher they went, the stronger the Yang attribute energy hidden in the steps became. The amount of Primordial Qi needed to dissipate it increased as well.

Looking up, they saw the seemingly endless staircase reaching up to the sky, and the sisters couldn’t help but silently groan.

In contrast to them, Yang Kai was enjoying himself immensely. After traversing a hundred layers, he had gained an extra drop of Yang Liquid in his Dantian, all derived from the Yang attribute energy rushing into his feet.

For the first three hundred layers, Yang Kai and the sisters walked leisurely. With each step, a surge of Yang attribute energy would rush into their bodies. As the number of layers increased, the energy gradually grew stronger, but it hadn’t yet reached a level that would stop them.

Needless to say, Yang Kai was fine; the True Yang Technique itself required this kind of energy. What surprised him a bit was Hu Mei’er; this girl, with her strength at the second layer of the Open Origin Realm, was surprisingly able to walk through three hundred layers with ease, which was unexpected.

However, after the three hundred layers, the energy hidden in the steps became significantly stronger. With each step, they had to pause slightly before continuing upward.

By the time they reached the four hundredth layer, this situation became even more pronounced. The sisters had to rest for about three breaths each time, and after being affected by this scorching Yang attribute energy for a long time, they were already sweating slightly, but they seemed to be managing it well.

Yang Kai continued to walk, silently counting the layers of steps.

He believed that this trial was not merely as simple as it appeared. If it were truly this easy, it would be too trivial. There must be some changes and unknown dangers hidden within.

At the four hundred and ninety layers, Hu Jiao’er and Hu Mei’er stopped. The elder sister glanced at Yang Kai, who seemed to be enjoying himself, feeling a surge of dissatisfaction.

She had promised to protect him this time, yet why did it seem that she was the one who looked more exhausted after traversing these steps? He, on the other hand, appeared completely pleased and content?

“Let’s rest before continuing.” Yang Kai glanced at them.

“No need!” Hu Jiao’er gritted her teeth and stepped ahead of Yang Kai.

After walking through ten more layers, when Hu Jiao’er stepped onto the five hundredth layer, her body involuntarily shivered.

Yang Kai, quick to react, pulled her down.

The two exchanged glances, and Hu Jiao’er asked, “What changed?”

Yang Kai frowned, not probing further. He stepped onto the five hundredth layer to feel it out. This time, the energy rushing into his feet was no longer the scorching Yang attribute energy but a chilling cold attribute energy.

Bone-chilling cold.

This sudden change from heat to cold was also the reason for Hu Jiao’er’s surprise.

“Is this the trial?” Yang Kai smiled slightly. He hadn’t expected the staircase ahead to contain the Yang attribute energy he needed; if it were just that, then any cultivator who practiced a Yang attribute technique could reach the top as long as they had enough time.

But now it was different; after five hundred layers, they were faced with the impact of cold attribute energy, which was the complete opposite of the Yang attribute.

In the face of the cold attribute energy rushing into his body, Yang Kai had two methods to choose from.

One was to use the True Yang Primordial Qi within his body to neutralize it.

The other was to operate the True Yang Technique to refine it and absorb it into his bones.

However, regardless of which method he chose, the consumption of his Primordial Qi was unavoidable, and the latter method consumed even more, making it less easy than just neutralizing it.

If Yang Kai hadn’t stored too much Yang Liquid in his Dantian, he might have chosen the first method.

But now, with over a hundred drops of Yang Liquid in his Dantian, he could choose the second method without any worries.

As the True Yang Technique operated, the cold energy rushing into his body was instantly refined and absorbed into his Proud Bone Golden Body.

“Let’s go.” Yang Kai turned back and smiled at the sisters, continuing to lead the way.

Hu Jiao’er shot Yang Kai an annoyed glance and whispered to her sister, “What is he so pleased about?”

Hu Mei’er forced a smile, “He’s not pleased.”
