## Chapter 1280 — Pursuers

Fortunately, aside from her cultivation of the Thousand Illusions Glaze technique, no one else could have detected this matter; not even the Sect Master could probe it unless the entire Glazed Mountain were uprooted. Besides, she had already shifted the blame onto that Drill Mountain Beast, so Yang Kai should not draw much suspicion.

At that thought, Daiyuan felt a small measure of relief. She immediately resolved to bury the matter deep in her heart, revealing it to no one. She even took pains to cover up the traces of the small tunnel beneath the room where Yang Kai had stayed.

Yang Kai never expected Daiyuan to have a way of discovering everything; he had assumed all had been done with neither gods nor ghosts knowing.

Before he left he had specially ordered the Stone Puppet to repair that underground passage, but he and Yang Yan both underestimated the profundity of the Thousand Illusions Glaze technique and the Glazed Light.

At this moment Yang Kai and Yang Yan were already one hundred thousand li away from the Taiqing Mountain Range, flying toward a certain destination.

Yet Yang Kai still felt an intangible unease. His expression was grave and his Divine Sense continually probed their surroundings.

"Why do I feel you’re being a bit cautious?" Yang Yan frowned and asked.

"Hm. When the Stone Puppet came out it ran into a very strange demonic beast. Although that beast was only Sixth-Tier and was struck dead by a single blow, the trouble at Glazed Mountain must be related to it. I don’t know whether that beast carried information back; if it did, we need to hurry."

"Xiaoxiao killed a demonic beast?" Yang Yan cried in surprise — she’d only learned of this now.

"It was probably a demonic beast specially kept by Liuli Sect; I don’t know the exact species. All I know is it could bypass the various seals beneath Glazed Mountain — likely Liuli Sect sent it down to scout. Luckily the Stone Puppet was sharp and killed it before it had any reaction, otherwise we would be in a right mess this time… huh." As he spoke, Yang Kai suddenly paused, looked ahead, and his expression shifted; he stopped moving.

"What is it?"

"Someone’s coming this way." Yang Kai narrowed his eyes and stared ahead, an expression of contemplation crossing his face.

Yang Yan followed his gaze but saw nothing. She knew Yang Kai was not ordinary, so she wasn’t overly surprised; she only asked softly, "They’re not coming for us, are they?"

If they were coming for them, they should be chasing from behind. Why would they meet them head-on?

"It’s Yin Sudie! They really are coming for us." Yang Kai gave a helpless smile.

Yang Yan thought for a moment, then said, "It seems the space array within Liuli Sect connects to a nearby city; otherwise this wouldn’t happen. What shall we do?"

"What can we do? If we avoid them now it would look suspicious." Yang Kai shook his head and instead feigned ignorance of the approaching figures, heading straight toward them.

He noticed the arriving party included more than just Yin Sudie, yet there were no experts of Origin Returning Realm among them, so he remained unafraid.

About a hundred li ahead Yin Sudie led two warriors at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm flying toward them. A trace of displeasure flickered across her brows — earlier she had been delighted when she heard the Sect Master ordered a thorough investigation of visitors. A few days before, when she had used her charm arts on Yang Kai she’d suffered a small setback and he had taken advantage of her, which greatly angered her.

Setting that aside, the fact that Yang Kai was Daiyuan’s guest was reason enough for Yin Sudie to pay close attention. She’d been fretting at her lack of opportunity to make trouble for Yang Kai, and now the chance had presented itself.

She very much wanted to know what the relationship between Daiyuan and Yang Kai truly was, and why this time Yang Kai had been brought back to Qianhuan Peak.

As it turned out, the supposed full investigation of visitors was more thunder than rain. She had eagerly reported to the elder in charge, only for that elder to lose interest upon learning Yang Kai was merely a Second Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivator; he had no intention of tracing the matter further. Still, that elder understood Yin Sudie’s mindset and did not stop her from going after him on her own.

So Yin Sudie pulled two capable allies from Liuli Sect, used the space array within the gate to transfer to a city a hundred thousand li away, and set out to intercept.

One of the warriors beside her was broad-shouldered and thick-waisted, hulking like a bear. The muscles on his bare arms stood up like ridges; he looked monstrously powerful and beset with murderous qi at his brows.

Yet when he looked at Yin Sudie he was all gentleness; his voice dropped when he spoke to her, careful not to offend the beauty.

The other man was handsome and dignified; at this moment a glint ran through his eyes as he surveyed their surroundings sternly, as if searching for something. Under his gaze everything within a hundred li was clear as day.

"Junior Brother Luo, found anyone yet?" the hulking man suddenly glanced at the other and asked in a low voice. "You’ve looked so long, how come you’ve found no clue? Are you holding back?"

“What are you urging me for?” The cultivator addressed as Junior Brother Luo showed displeasure upon hearing this. “They left the Taiqing Mountain Range long ago. Though we set up an ambush ahead, who can say which direction they took? Senior Brother Hou, if you’re so uneasy, why not search for them yourself? I heard you’ve been diligently cultivating your Divine Sense lately—this would be a fine chance to test the results of your hard work! It seems Master even rewarded you with a bottle of Spirit-Clearing Pills, so your Divine Sense should be much stronger than before, shouldn’t it?”

Luo’s teasing brought a flush to Hou’s face. His cultivation didn’t emphasize Divine Sense, and so Divine Sense had long been a weakness of his. As his strength grew, that weakness became more obvious, which had forced him to begin bitterly training his Divine Sense recently.

Now that his pain was teased out by his junior brother, and in front of a beauty no less, Hou’s face darkened. Usually the brothers got along well, but here, before Yin Sudie, some jealousy was unavoidable.

Seeing Hou’s embarrassment and the anger itching to erupt, Yin Sudie quickly soothed them: "Both of you, stop fighting. I asked you out precisely because I need the two of you to work together. Brother Luo’s Clear Spirit-Eye Secret Art is perfect for locating someone in this situation, and once the person is found, Brother Hou will be the one to seize him. You both must have seen the trouble with the Sect’s treasure, Glazed Mountain; the Sect Master and many elders suspect foul play. That fellow Yang left not a moment too soon, so we can’t let him slip away."

Yin Sudie showed no irritation at their quarrel; instead her pretty face displayed pleasure as if she delighted in their bickering. But tracking Yang Kai was the priority, so she urged them to cooperate.

Hearing this, Hou’s face grew fierce and he believed her words: "So that brat really was behind it?"

"I don’t know either," Yin Sudie smiled and shook her head, "but this matter is serious; any suspicious person cannot be let go. Capture him and hand him to the elders of the Sect, and they will judge him."

She spoke with a featherweight authority; she dared not claim too much. Her words were enough to placate Hou, while Luo appeared thoughtful — clearly he understood more but kept silent.

For Luo it was a trivial matter to seek someone; the real prize was currying favor with Yin Sudie.

“Fine, fine, Junior Brother Luo—search more carefully. Once you find that brat, I’ll personally take action and capture him. Daring to set his sights on our Glazed Mountain—I’d like to see whether he really has three heads and six arms!” As he spoke, a mouthful of gleaming white fangs was bared, giving him a frightful appearance.

Just as Luo was about to speak, his spirit suddenly shivered and he whispered, "Found them!"

"Where?" Yin Sudie brightened and asked anxiously.

"Over there, coming toward us!" Luo pointed and nodded slightly. "Yes, exactly as Sister described: one man and one woman, the woman wrapped in black robes — that’s them."

"Then there’s no mistake." Yin Sudie gave a coquettish laugh.

"How amusing — they’re walking right into our trap!" Hou grinned savagely and barked, "Senior Brother, go on ahead. Junior Brother Luo, protect our Sister; wait to seize them!"

Seeing this, the cultivator surnamed Luo understood that the burly man intended to snatch the credit. Since he was the one who had discovered the target, he simply let the other handle the capture—it mattered little to him. It was a good chance, after all, to enjoy some time alone with Yin Sudie. Turning his head slightly with a smile, he said, “Senior Brother Hou is still as impatient as ever. Junior Sister, let’s take our time. By the time we get there, Senior Brother will likely have finished already. Against someone at merely the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, how much of a threat could he really be?”

A flicker of something unreadable passed through Yin Sudie’s pretty eyes, but she nodded as if unconcerned. "Fine — all thanks to Brother Luo’s Clear Spirit-Eye. Otherwise it would have been a hassle to find someone over such a wide area."

"Not at all, Sister. If you ever need Brother Luo again, ask and I won’t refuse. Wanren Peak and our Feiniaо Peak aren’t far apart; if you have time one day, come visit Feiniaо Peak and Brother Luo will accompany you for a few days — an honor for Brother Luo." He even took the initiative to invite her, his admiration plain.

Yin Sudie chuckled coquettishly and offered a noncommittal reply. Though she gave no definite answer, her radiant face and tinkling laughter left Luo momentarily stunned, his eyes nearly bulging. His heart dropped as he realized his junior sister had made progress in her charm arts; he’d heard that once Master Xiao’s Origin Condensing Pill was refined she could attempt to break through to the Origin Returning Realm. It seemed the rumor was true.
