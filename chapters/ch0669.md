## Chapter 669 — The World Is Small

The three pressed on, releasing their Divine Sense into the wind and snow to probe the surroundings; before long, the thinly dressed woman suddenly brightened and pointed in one direction, saying, "There should be Spiritual Medicine over there!"

Saying that, she hurriedly led the other two and dashed over.

A few tens of zhang away, after some effort the three brushed aside several chi of thick snow, and beneath the drifts a plant of translucent ice crystal grew; its stems and leaves refracted a bewildering halo in the sunlight, like crystal—quite beautiful.

At the top of that plant grew several snow-white fruits the size of fingernails, from which a faint, clean fragrance drifted.

"Sister Ji, you're amazing—finding the White Jade Fruit hidden so deep," the younger woman said excitedly, clapping her hands.

Ji Meng chuckled, gazing indulgently at Zhu Yingyue, and comforted her, "Pay more attention; you'll find them too."

Zhu Yingyue pouted. "I've already tried very hard, but I can never beat you—even Senior Brother Qi."

Qi Chao heard this and at once felt displeased. "Am I that weak?"

Zhu Yingyue snorted, "You're quite a bit worse than Sister Ji."

Ji Meng tapped her on the head, "I'll share some with you when we get back—don't be discouraged."

The younger one nodded, coquettishly simple.

Qi Chao stepped forward. "Harvest them first, be careful not to damage the roots; wait ten or so years and it will bear White Jade Fruit again."

Ji Meng nodded, extended her slender jade hand, carefully plucked the fruits, and placed them into her Spatial Pouch.

When it came to such regenerative Spiritual Herbs and Medicines, cultivators generally avoided damaging the root when harvesting; despoiling everything at once was not a good practice and would reduce the world's yield of such herbs and medicines.

With their haul, the three seemed very happy, but suddenly Qi Chao and Ji Meng's brows tightened as they looked in one direction, their faces filling with heavy vigilance.

They sensed someone rapidly approaching from that side.

A moment later a vague figure appeared in the wind and snow, and soon the person reached a spot some ten zhang in front of the three.

Yang Kai took in their expressions but paid it no mind; in such desolate wilds anyone suddenly meeting strangers would be wary.

Before coming he had also confirmed they lacked the cultivation to threaten him, which was why he had shown himself so openly.

If the others had been masters above Transcendent two Stages, Yang Kai would have avoided them.

The three looked young; they shouldn't be hard to talk to.

Yang Kai slightly nodded and offered a friendly smile.

"Who are you?" Qi Chao stepped forward, blocking Ji Meng and Zhu Yingyue, and demanded coldly, "How did you come to appear in these snow mountains?"

"A passing traveler who carelessly lost his way," Yang Kai said kindly.

"A passing traveler?" Qi Chao frowned and appraised Yang Kai up and down, suspicion deepening on his face. "It's not as simple as being a passerby; did you come into these snow mountains with some other purpose?"

Qi Chao's ill temper puzzled Yang Kai; he couldn't tell how he had offended him and could only explain, "I really am just passing by. I sensed your presence and came to take a look; I mean nothing else. I only wanted to ask how to get out of here—I've been wandering these snow mountains for many days."

As he spoke, Yang Kai suddenly noticed the White Jade Fruit tree behind them; its crystalline, translucent appearance made him look a few seconds longer.

Qi Chao read his expression and grew more vigilant, staring intently at Yang Kai; Yang Kai's face remained frank, showing no unease.

He wasn’t exactly lying — though he had been transmitted out of the Small Xuan Realm, his present aim truly was only to find a clear direction and first leave these boundless snow mountains.

After some time Qi Chao finally suppressed his hostility and slowly nodded. "I'll trust you for now. But these snow mountains are not a place outsiders can randomly trespass. If you want to leave, go in this direction."

Saying this, he pointed in a direction.

Yang Kai turned to look, cupped his fist, and said, "Thanks. Farewell for now."

With that, he unfurled his movement and darted off in that direction.

"Wait!" Qi Chao called out coldly again.

"What?" Yang Kai halted and frowned.

"You didn't gather any Spiritual Herb or marvelous medicine in these snow mountains, did you? If you did, hand it over. This is territory of our Divine Cult; everything here belongs to Divine Cult—outsiders cannot take even a blade of grass or a single tree!"

A teasing expression rose on Yang Kai's face; he felt some impatience. Even if he hadn't gathered anything, and even if he had, no one would give it up when spoken to in such an imperious tone. These endless snow mountains could be vast; no single force could possibly monopolize them.

Glancing at the two women behind him, Yang Kai couldn't be bothered to make a fuss and replied faintly, "No."

The next moment Yang Kai felt a Divine Sense shamelessly sweep through him.

Such nerve, he thought with an amused smile—he wasn't afraid to retaliate and utterly cripple the man in an instant!

After considering it, Yang Kai made no extra move and let him probe.

A moment later Qi Chao nodded with satisfaction. "You may go."

Yang Kai said nothing, turned, and shot into the wind and snow.

After he left, Zhu Yingyue whispered, "Senior Brother Qi, over there—"

"Shh!" Qi Chao raised a finger, slowly shook his head, looked around, and led the two women off in another direction.

Zhu Yingyue followed them with a face full of suspicion, occasionally glancing back toward the direction Yang Kai had disappeared, her eyes flickering with reluctance and worry.

After walking for a full hour, Zhu Yingyue finally couldn't help but ask again, "Senior Brother Qi, why did you point him the wrong way?"

Ji Meng smiled, "I'd like to know too, Qi Chao, what are you doing?"

"That man is suspicious—didn't you notice?" Qi Chao glanced at them and said firmly, "What he said cannot be trusted."

Ji Meng was speechless and slowly shook her head. "Even if he's suspicious, you don't harm someone that way—are you trying to get him killed? That's a Demonic Beast activity zone; if he ventures in there alone, how could he survive?"

"Whether he lives or dies is none of our concern," Qi Chao snorted coldly. "When you're out, you must guard against others. His strength seems higher than ours; I'm only considering our safety."

"How do you know that? I didn't notice at all," Zhu Yingyue asked innocently.

"Because he discovered us first," Qi Chao explained seriously. "He's not a Divine Cult disciple—coming into these snow mountains he's either after herbs or has some other aim. Didn't you see his reaction when he saw the White Jade Fruit tree? He looked tempted. If I hadn't led him astray, he might have killed to seize the treasure. My death would be one thing, but if you two fell into the hands of such a man—hmm..."

Zhu Yingyue's pretty face turned pale and her delicate body trembled; thinking back on Yang Kai's appearance, she faintly felt that man might indeed be beastly in heart.

Ji Meng's brows knit and she sneered, "Why do you think so poorly of people? If he truly is as he said, he's just a lost traveler—getting lost in these snow mountains is perfectly normal."

"Then why don't you go back and find him now and tell him that way is a dead end," Qi Chao snorted.

Ji Meng retorted in annoyance, "Where am I supposed to find him now?"

"You didn't make a sound when I lied to him earlier, did you? Why argue with me now—he's just an outsider," Qi Chao replied, somewhat irritated.

"I was worried because you're a fellow disciple; I didn't want you to lose face before outsiders!"

"Stop arguing," Zhu Yingyue hurriedly urged as the two only grew more heated.

"Alright, alright, just this once—no next time. Good deeds aren't rewarded," Qi Chao said disheartened, and strode off.

Ji Meng sighed helplessly, glanced back with hesitation, and after a long moment shook her head and followed Qi Chao.

"Sister Ji, will he die?" Zhu Yingyue asked softly.

"Maybe."

"Did Senior Brother Qi do wrong?"

"No, he has his reasons," Ji Meng smiled faintly. Yet that man had released his Divine Sense before appearing, deliberately informing the three of them—clearly he bore no malice.

If he had truly intended harm, he could have concealed himself and ambushed them outright.

Ji Meng couldn't understand why Qi Chao had pointed him the wrong way; she felt guilty toward the stranger.

.........

Yang Kai's face was grim as he looked at the corpse of a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast at his feet, breathing lightly.

Blood soaked his body—the battle just fought had not been easy.

A Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast corresponded to a human's Transcendent Stage cultivation; fortunately, this particular Seventh-Tier wasn't too hard to deal with.

Following the yellow-robed man's directions, Yang Kai had traveled onward, yet in only three to five days he had encountered seven or eight attacks by Demonic Beasts.

Every one of those beasts had been slain beneath his palm; had it been another peak Divine Roaming Realm practitioner fighting native ice-type Demonic Beasts in such conditions, they would likely have died countless times over.

Moreover, as time passed Yang Kai found the wind and snow growing heavier, and it seemed he had returned to where he had been before.

This realization put a very bad look on his face.

By now he also understood he had probably been deceived by that man.

They were strangers meeting by chance; he merely asked for directions and showed no hostile intent. Once given an answer Yang Kai naturally did not suspect anything—who would have expected the man to be so despicable?

He extracted the beast's inner core, broke off its two horns, then turned, cold as ice, and retraced his steps.

Climbing towering snow mountains and walking through the boundless white world, Yang Kai's mood was far from pleasant.

Three days later Yang Kai suddenly stopped.

He listened intently, released his Divine Sense to survey, and his expression instantly became strange.

A little over ten li ahead were two familiar life auras—two of the three people he'd met earlier—but their mental states were unstable, as if chased by something; panicked, they were fleeing directly toward where he stood.

Yang Kai also detected a powerful life fluctuation hot on their heels—the aura of a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast.

The world really is small!

Yang Kai smiled oddly, stood his ground, and began to wait quietly.
