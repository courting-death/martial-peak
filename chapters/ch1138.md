## Chapter 1138 — A Brand-New Method of Attack

"So low?" Yang Kai cried in astonishment; if this were truly the case, then it would mean that both he and Yang Flame were already standing at the very pinnacle of Dark Star in their respective fields.

Yang Flame might even be higher; she had said before that with the help of Stone Puppets she could refine her purple shield up to Origin-Grade Middle-Level, which meant she was at the very least an Origin-Grade Middle-Level artificer.

"Yes, it's very low. I don't know why, but the alchemy, artificing, map-making, even array work on Dark Star have developed very slowly," Wu Yi chuckled. She knew Yang Kai came from outside; from his tone she could infer the outside world certainly wasn't like this.

Hearing Wu Yi's words, Yang Kai immediately thought that using alchemy to raise Saint Crystals was a very good idea.

His alchemical skill already stood at Dark Star's peak; would he still be afraid of not gathering enough Saint Crystals by refining pills? He could even trade with larger powers for many precious materials.

Yang Flame's array deployment was just like cultivating spatial power for himself; it burned resources. Without sufficient Saint Crystals and materials, nothing could be accomplished.

"How does the Xu Family have ten King Transformation Pills?" Yang Kai asked again. Logically, the Xu Family shouldn't have a Saint King-Grade alchemist; without an alchemist of that caliber, they couldn't refine King Transformation Pills.

"They probably traded with Yingyue Hall," Wu Yi explained. "Those small families affiliated with Yingyue Hall have chances to exchange for some pills or Secret Treasures, but they pay a high price. The Haike Family once exchanged for some King Transformation Pills before. Oh, and the Saint King Pill they brought last time also came from Yingyue Hall."

"I see." Yang Kai nodded and casually tossed two jade bottles over. "Give these to them. Tell them to stop arguing."

"What's that?" Wu Yi asked in puzzlement.

"You'll see," Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Wu Yi suspiciously opened a bottle and her complexion changed; she cried out, "King Transformation Pills — over twenty? And so many with Pill Patterns?"

She was truly stunned.

The ten King Transformation Pills taken from Xu Zhikun's ring were only ordinary pills, but these Yang Kai gave were mostly imbued with Pill Patterns; Wu Yi could hardly imagine where Yang Kai had obtained them.

King Transformation Pills could increase a warrior's chance to rise to the Saint King Realm, and those with Pill Patterns raised that chance even more!

"Eldest Brother Yang, where did you get these?" Wu Yi looked up and, to her surprise, Yang Kai had already vanished. Her head spun — a King Transformation Pill was worth over two thousand Saint Crystals; this bottle alone was worth over forty thousand!

Only then did Wu Yi understand just how generous Yang Kai truly was.

With trembling hands she opened the other jade bottle. She cried out again: "Saint King Pills!"

Many of the Saint King Pills also showed Pill Patterns. Wu Yi was certain both bottles of pills came from the same alchemist — the chance of generating Pill Patterns seemed terrifyingly high.

In her life, Wu Yi had only seen one pill with a Pill Pattern, and it was merely a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill.

Even for someone as worldly as Wu Yi, the two jade bottles felt like mountains. The King Transformation Pills could let her brothers and sisters ascend to the Saint King Realm, and the Saint King Pills could stabilize their cultivations. Yang Kai had prepared everything; they only needed to take the pills.

"Thank you, Eldest Brother Yang!" Wu Yi shouted toward the cave entrance, then turned back into the still noisy stone chamber and joyfully raised the two jade bottles: "Stop arguing — there's a King Transformation Pill for everyone, and even Saint King Pills!"

The noisy stone chamber fell silent at once, nearly twenty pairs of eyes fixed on Wu Yi.

Outside the cave, Yang Flame was arranging an array. The Saint Crystals Yang Kai had given Wu Yi had been converted into various materials except for some kept for cultivation. Yang Flame was now laying down a killing array; her slender body was wrapped by a wide black robe, and she worked busily.

"Come help!" Yang Flame called, and Yang Kai immediately went over to assist under her direction.

After a while of work, Yang Kai suddenly asked, "Yang Flame, will the array you set up be effective if an Origin Returning Realm warrior comes in?"

"Yes!" Yang Flame answered confidently, "But it won't be like last time. The Origin Returning Realm is stronger. If a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm person comes in, the array can only entrap him for ten breaths."

Yang Kai nodded, understanding in his heart.

Yang Flame's movements paused and she looked at Yang Kai solemnly: "What are your plans for the future?"

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai was taken aback.

"Do you intend to stay here long-term, or will you leave once the mine below is exhausted?"

"Of course I'll stay," Yang Kai found it odd. He was unfamiliar with Dark Star and wouldn't leave so easily with a place to settle.

"Good. I like it here, too. If you stay I'll fortify the array more solidly," Yang Flame smiled. "If you give me higher-grade materials later, I can make it so that even a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cannot get in!"

Yang Kai's eyes brightened; his opinion of Yang Flame rose considerably.

As they spoke, Wu Yi suddenly rushed out of the cave, her face flushed and clearly excited.

"Distributed already?" Yang Kai asked with a smile.

"Yes. Everyone's gone into closed cultivation; it won't be long before they reach the Saint King Realm. Thank you, Eldest Brother Yang," Wu Yi nodded and added, "I forgot to tell you something earlier."

"What?"

"Guest Elder Chang and Guest Elder Hao sent word saying the Family Head went to Tianyun City to the city lord's mansion three days ago with many gifts."

"Guest Elder Chang, Guest Elder Hao?" Yang Kai frowned and immediately recalled these two — Guest Elder Chang naturally referred to Chang Qi, who had the highest strength on the warship, and Guest Elder Hao should be Hao An, who came to meet them when the warship returned to Dark Star.

It seemed these two Guest Elders had a good relationship with Wu Yi; otherwise they wouldn't have sent word.

"Guest Elder Huang also sent word, saying the same thing," Wu Yi frowned, puzzled why Huang Juan would help her this time, and from her words it seemed Huang Juan intended to leave the Haike Family and urged Wu Yi to leave Dragon Lair Mountain soon.

Yang Kai didn't know Huang Juan and paid it no mind. He merely said, "Your Family Head going to Tianyun City — he must be seeking Yingyue Hall, right?"

"Yes. Eldest Brother Yang, what should we do? Once Yingyue Hall learns you killed so many Xu Family people they won't sit idle; they'll surely send Origin Returning Realm experts."

"Origin Returning Realm!" Yang Kai frowned. To be honest, he didn't know how his strength compared to that realm, but each great realm leap brought a world of change; someone who could easily slay a Third Stage of the Saint King Realm might not be a match for the Origin Returning Realm.

Yet he soon found it odd. "Strange — why would your family go running to report this? It should be the Xu Family reporting, right?"

Wu Yi thought a moment, biting her lip: "Maybe the Family Head feels he can't control you or drive you out, so he wants to rely on Yingyue Hall's power."

One had to admit, Wu Yi was cunning; she understood Ian's character well and her deduction was basically the truth.

Yang Kai nodded: "Don't fear. Do what we need to do. If Origin Returning Realm people come I can hold them off."

"Oh." Wu Yi nodded lightly; though not confident, since Yang Kai said it she couldn't protest.

After Wu Yi left, Yang Flame said calmly: "Don't expect my array to kill Origin Returning Realm people. Without higher-grade materials, my arrays aren't powerful."

"I don't fully rely on your array," Yang Kai grinned. As long as Yang Flame's array could temporarily entrap an Origin Returning Realm person it would be fine; provided it wasn't a Third Stage of that realm, he felt he could handle it.

This was about the Ethereal Crystal vein; even if Void King Realm fighters came, Yang Kai would fight for it. He couldn't hand over this treasure.

He stopped helping Yang Flame and returned to the cave to enter seclusion, holding an Ethereal Crystal and absorbing its energy while deepening his understanding of spatial power.

Spatial power was an obscure path, but also very powerful. Yang Kai believed that if he were to face the Origin Returning Realm, using spatial power would be the best choice.

Previously, when he used spatial power, it had been fused into attacks of Saint Yuan to break through spatial seals and catch opponents off-guard. That method strengthened Saint Yuan attacks but didn't fully reveal the secrets of spatial power.

If he could use spatial power purely as an attack, Yang Kai believed his combat strength would be stronger and more untraceable.

He didn't know when Yingyue Hall's people would come, but sharpening his skills at the last moment was better than nothing. He focused on spatial power, aiming to form a killing move unique to himself.

After consuming so many Ethereal Crystals, his understanding of this obscure power had reached a new height; he was no longer a half-bucket of water.

He believed that with his current grasp of space, if he returned to the Floating Continent he could easily leave.

Ripping open space was a means of escape, not a way to kill. Yet from countless experiences tearing space, Yang Kai had glimpsed a new attack method. He repeatedly simulated in his Sea of Consciousness, negating and revising until a complete idea formed; then he suddenly opened his eyes.

With his right hand he lightly gestured forward, and a space rift a finger's length long and half an inch wide suddenly appeared, exuding a strange aura of void turbulence; within it was utter nothingness and chaos.

After the rift appeared it did not remain stationary as before, but slowly pushed forward.

Wherever the rift passed, everything in that space — including Spiritual Qi and air — was devoured.

It moved forward two feet before the rift abruptly closed and vanished.
