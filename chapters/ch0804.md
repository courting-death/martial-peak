## Chapter 804 — Your Mother Truly Is a Heroine

Hearing Yang Kai's question, everyone nodded in unison. Yu Ying said, "Though that old fellow is a bit unpleasant, the young girl who followed him is very endearing. I haven't seen her face, but I believe she's no worse than our Saintess, and... her cultivation was very high—probably not far behind yours. Before I met you, she was the most outstanding young person we'd seen."

"That was two or three years ago; her cultivation by now should be higher than mine!" Yang Kai declared, a strange emotion flooding him.

Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang!

Very few in the world could make the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land show them such courtesy; Meng Wuya might be one of them. That he had been followed by a girl bearing such a resemblance in bearing and looks to Xia Ningshang—who Xu Hui and the others had mentioned—meant they were almost certainly the ones.

It was surprising that they had also visited the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

"Do you know them, young brother?" Xu Hui and the others exchanged glances and noticed Yang Kai was lost in thought, a meaningful smile on his face as if recalling something; they immediately realized the new Saint Lord may have met that old man and young girl before.

"How to put it... you could say I know them," Yang Kai chuckled.

Xu Hui brightened and was about to ask more when Yang Kai added, "But it's been years; I don't know where they are now."

"Is that so..." Xu Hui's face showed disappointment, but he quickly recovered. "Since we can't find anyone to help, we'll have to rely on ourselves. Fortunately, you brought out the Saint Lord's Spirit Ring; with that ring, if those people truly dare to assault us, they'll pay the price!"

"Indeed!" everyone agreed and returned to their planning.

Yang Kai seized an opportunity and slipped away unnoticed.

Following the memory from earlier in the day, he flew toward a peak on the left among the Nine Peaks.

The peak was not much different from the other eight—hundreds of zhang high, thrusting into the clouds with majestic grandeur.

But from mid‑slope upward an icy chill pervaded the air. The higher he climbed, the stronger it grew; near the summit countless jagged ice spikes, long and short like spear points, hung inverted from the rock.

When he activated the arrays on the mountain earlier that day, Yang Kai had found it odd, but he hadn't asked then.

Now he intended to see what his little senior sister had arranged there.

He soared upward and in no time reached the summit. The bone‑deep cold penetrated to the soul, nearly freezing thought itself.

Yang Kai probed carefully; his face shifted. Even with Divine Sense Fire, he had to exert fully to resist the summit's chill.

Circulating True Yuan did nothing to dispel the cold around him.

Strange.

Yang Kai shook his head, but confident in his skill, he stepped forward.

Soon an impossibly clear deep pool came into view; the chill seemed to emanate from it. The pool's surroundings were barren—people rarely came here; even those of the Sacred Land seldom visited.

Subtle energy fluctuations flowed around the pool, arranged in a strangely wondrous pattern.

Yang Kai released his Divine Sense and examined them; his expression brightened.

It was indeed his little senior sister's handiwork: many traces of spirit formations matched those he had once taught Xia Ningshang.

Why had she set this up here? Xu Hui had said she and Shopkeeper Meng had taken nothing; perhaps the time had not yet come and they would return when the moment was right.

What secret lay hidden in the icy pool? Could it relate to lifting Meng Wuya's seal?

Yang Kai guessed, but did not dare be certain.

Chu Lingxiao had said Meng Wuya once fought the Demon Lord and was struck by the Tianxuan Sealing Art, suppressing his strength down to the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm. He fled to Zhongdu, perhaps to seek the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body; in Zhongdu he broke the first seal and recovered to the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm.

Years later he remained unseen; nobody knew his current condition.

Yang Kai had long been curious about Shopkeeper Meng's true cultivation.

That old fellow knew Chu Lingxiao, Qing Ya of the Ice Sect, and the old Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—each a top‑tier figure.

Any one of those three was among the supreme masters; to know them suggested his own cultivation could hardly be weak.

Wherever he went he left behind an air of mystery.

"What are you doing at Yingyue Pool?" a voice suddenly asked from behind. Yang Kai had been deep in thought and hadn't noticed An Ling'er approach. His True Yuan surged but then settled as he turned to her. "Just looking. This is Yingyue Pool?"

"Yes." An Ling'er smiled and glanced skyward. "No moon tonight; with a moon this would be a beautiful scene. I don't know what secret the pool holds—the surface can show the moon's reflection hovering above the water, as if the moon hung in the air. Little Lian and I used to play here..."

Thinking of the three sisters slain by Saintess Nan, her mood darkened.

"So strange?" Yang Kai quickly changed the subject to spare her sorrow. "Do none of you in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land know what the pool hides?"

An Ling'er slowly shook her head. "The Grand Elder won't go down; we don't know how deep the pool is. The old Saint Lord investigated once and found nothing—afterward he forbade entry. So truly no one knows what lies within. Besides, standing on the summit used to not feel cold; only going into the pool brought the chill. Now even the summit is cold—probably related to what that young girl arranged."

After a short while An Ling'er shivered and her lips went pale. "Let's go back—it's too cold here."

Yang Kai nodded and accompanied her downward.

That night Yang Kai thought long and, by morning, had settled on a decision.

The next day he found Xu Hui and said plainly, "Grand Elder, I want to meet the yao lord."

Xu Hui trembled and exclaimed in astonishment, "You mean to see him? Do you intend to ask him for aid?"

Yang Kai smiled and shook his head. "He had dealings with the old Saint Lord, not with me. Even if I sought his aid, he would likely refuse."

"Then why..." Xu Hui asked, puzzled.

Yang Kai's expression turned serious. After a moment he said, "Grand Elder, have you considered temporarily abandoning the Sacred Land's foundation?"

"Abandon it?" Xu Hui frowned.

"Yes—abandon it, but only temporarily." Yang Kai nodded. "As the proverb goes, preserve the green hills and you will not lack firewood later. With the current enemy formation the Sacred Land cannot hold. If you insist on fighting to the last, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land may truly be destroyed in your generation. Some elders might escape, but what of the thousands of disciples?"

Xu Hui's face dimmed and he sighed deeply. "We know that, but where could six or seven thousand disciples go? Poxuan Palace, the War Soul Hall, and the Netherworld Sect have chosen to make enemies of us; they will not stop. They know the lesson of not killing a snake completely. If we flee, they will pursue and slaughter those left behind. Better to stay and fight to the death."

"So you've considered abandoning the base?" Yang Kai's eyes lit up.

Xu Hui awkwardly admitted that though dishonorable, they had considered it: preserving the Sacred Land's bloodline was paramount; they could save themselves for a future comeback and to make their enemies pay.

As he spoke, Xu Hui's face grew grim with resolve.

"Good. Since you've considered it, I won't waste words," Yang Kai smiled inscrutably. "I have a place where the Sacred Land's people can be safely housed; from there your enemies can do nothing to you."

"Oh?" Xu Hui brightened, asking eagerly, "Do you mean..."

"Not convenient to say now—wait until the time comes and you'll see. Of course, you must trust me," Yang Kai teased.

"We trust you!" Xu Hui agreed, then grew suspicious: "But how does this relate to meeting the yao lord?"

"They're separate, but if you really plan to abandon the base temporarily, I'll go see the yao lord," Yang Kai said with a sly grin. "No one will let the Sacred Land's foundation fall without consequence... Imagine if the Yao learned the place was empty—what would they do then?"

Xu Hui frowned gravely. "The Yao's Spiritual Qi is far weaker than ours; they have long coveted this land. If we truly left it empty, they would surely move in and occupy the Nine Peaks..."

As Xu Hui spoke, realization dawned and he stared, dumbfounded, at the new Saint Lord, his face twitching as he hadn't expected such cunning.

Yang Kai chuckled darkly. "My mother taught me: repay respect with greater respect, and repay harm a hundredfold!"

Xu Hui felt a chill as if plunged into ice; after a moment he muttered, "Your mother truly is a heroine among women..."

"Enough. I know you can't decide this alone. Go discuss it with Elder Yu Ying and the others. If they agree, inform me."

Xu Hui's eyes flickered; he clasped his fists and said, "I can't decide alone, but if you agree to inherit..."

"Get lost!" Yang Kai snapped, cutting him off and glaring.

Xu Hui's mouth twitched; he slunk away dejectedly.
