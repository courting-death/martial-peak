## Chapter 933 — Blood Servants' Lament

As the Cult Master of the Xiaoyao Divine Cult, Wu Zheng of course recognized Yang Kai — after all, back then he had pursued the Ancient Demon Clan together with Chu Yi of Tianmu Palace and Fang Yuebai of Mist Shroud Tower all the way outside the Nine Peaks.

He loathed this young man who cavorted with demons and even harbored a streak of jealousy.

There was no other reason: the fellow was still so young yet already the head of a major power, and he could command so many obedient demon experts.

The power he wielded made everyone envious.

Wu Zheng couldn't understand why he was inferior to Yang Kai in any way — why such good fortune never fell to him.

"Wu Zheng!" Yang Kai flashed him a grin, silent and uncanny.

"Saint Lord Yang... long time no see." Wu Zheng took in his surroundings with a furrowed brow. "I wonder why the Saint Lord has come here? Have you seen Qiu Xu and Xiuli? I just heard Qiu Xu cry out and sensed another battle nearby. Could it be that the Saint Lord..."

"If you're referring to the one-eyed man and the middle-aged woman, they're already dead."

"Dead?" Wu Zheng's expression changed. He stared at Yang Kai, "They weren't killed by the Saint Lord, were they?"

"Correct." Yang Kai admitted frankly.

Wu Zheng's face chilled and he narrowed his eyes. "Why did you kill them? They had no enmity with the Saint Lord, did they?"

"Must there be enmity to kill someone?" Yang Kai laughed loudly, casting a sidelong look at Wu Zheng. He pointed a finger at him and, with a feral grin, said, "Not only will they die today, you'll die too!"

Wu Zheng's expression twitched. He cast a cautious glance at Li Rong and Han Fei, then forced a smile. "Saint Lord, what do you mean by this? I don't believe I've offended you."

Having heard Qiu Xu's cries earlier, Wu Zheng had sensed something amiss and rushed over without stopping, finding Yang Kai here. He didn't understand the whole situation, so he felt only a faint sense of danger.

After all, Yang Kai was the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; he wouldn't kill without reason. Wu Zheng himself was a faction head and by no means inferior to Yang Kai.

Naturally, he assumed that since they were peers, any matter could be settled by talking.

Little did he know Yang Kai had no intention of negotiating — his opening words were dripping with murderous intent.

"What more could you have done to offend me?" Yang Kai's gaze was icy and his tone grim. "This place is my home; you came with your friends to bully my family..."

Before Yang Kai could finish, Wu Zheng realized the situation had turned grave.

Whether Yang Kai's words were true or false, the fact remained that Qiu Xu and Xiuli were dead. If Yang Kai had the nerve to kill them, he might well kill Wu Zheng as well.

Wu Zheng was decisive. Before Yang Kai finished explaining, he unleashed a shield secret treasure that became a luminous barrier around him and, at top speed, fled outward toward Zhongdu.

Yang Kai frowned, watching the direction of his escape, and waved his hand strangely.

Han Fei said nothing and pursued at once.

Wu Zheng's fate required no guessing — he was doomed to die.

The Ancient Demon Clan could perform Demon God Transformation, and nearly every one of them could fight above their grade. Li Rong once matched Xueli when both were at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm; today Han Fei was also Second Stage of the Saint Realm, so killing Wu Zheng was merely a matter of time.

"Li Rong, take a walk through Zhongdu and clear out everyone Wu Zheng brought here."

"Yes." Li Rong replied, vanishing in a flash as a vast Divine Sense spread like a tide, penetrating every corner of Zhongdu.

Only then did Yang Kai descend.

"Young Master!" The Blood Servants looked at him with excited expressions and shouted his name.

Yang Kai glanced over them and nodded. "It's fine. Go back for now; we'll talk later."

"Very well."

By the time Yang Kai arrived at the Yang Family, Li Rong had finished the cleanup. Most of the people Wu Zheng had brought were gathered there, and she had taken them out in one fell swoop.

After hearing the full account from Li Rong, many of the Yang Family's direct descendants waited for Yang Kai's arrival in high spirits.

Fourth Master Yang and his wife were particularly eager; Dong Suzhu kept wiping her tears, overwhelmed with relief.

Moments later, Yang Kai and the Blood Servants came into view. Dong Suzhu ignored Fourth Master Yang's attempts to stop her and ran straight up to Yang Kai.

"Mother!" Yang Kai called eagerly.

Dong Suzhu appraised him from head to toe as if to ensure he was unhurt. Once satisfied, she threw her arms around him.

The hug squeezed the breath from Yang Kai.

Li Rong looked on oddly at the reunion; had Yang Kai not called out first she would have taken the woman who looked like a young girl to be Yang Kai's sister. She had not expected her to be his mother.

"Come on, everyone's waiting. You holding onto him like that looks ridiculous," Fourth Master Yang called, heading over because there had been no movement for some time.

"I don't care... he's my son." Dong Suzhu wept as if someone were trying to take Yang Kai from her.

"Father!" Yang Kai grinned and greeted Fourth Master Yang.

"Good, well done!" Fourth Master Yang nodded heavily; a look of relief creased his eyes.

Yang Kai had been gone for more than ten years with no word, and his parents had worried sick. Now not only was their son safe, but it turned out Yang Kai had led the rescue of Zhongdu — Fourth Master Yang felt a swelling pride.

After a while, Dong Suzhu calmed and released Yang Kai.

"We can talk as a family tonight," Yang Kai patted her hand to comfort her.

"Hmm."

Yang Kai stepped forward, greeting the elders and his seven brothers in turn as his gaze swept across their faces.

There was a warm, harmonious atmosphere.

"Ninth Brother!" The brothers, stirred, looked at him. Though the youngest of the nine, Yang Kai was now the most accomplished, making the others feel both ashamed and proud.

"Second Brother, how fares the family headship?" Yang Kai laughed and asked Yang Zhao.

Yang Zhao sighed. "You don't know how costly running a household is until you do it. I used to oversimplify things. If I had another chance, I wouldn't have taken part in the Succession War."

Among the nine brothers, aside from Yang Kai, Yang Zhao was the most suitable as family head. First Brother Yang Wei was powerful but obsessed with martial cultivation and uninterested in other matters, so the elders lacked confidence to entrust him with the clan.

Thus after Yang Kai left, the family had been managed by Yang Zhao.

In the ten years since they last met, the brothers had all settled down and had children of their own.

"Let's go inside and talk; the brothers haven't gathered like this in a long time," Yang Zhao made space and invited them in.

In the Yang Family ancestral hall, under Fourth Master Yang's orders, Yang Kai entered to offer incense to their ancestors.

According to Fourth Master Yang, their narrow escape was entirely thanks to ancestral protection and had nothing to do with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai could only play along.

After the rites, Yang Kai left the hall and, following Fourth Master Yang, came to the main hall of the Yang Family.

The main hall was packed. At Yang Kai's arrival, everyone's expression shifted and dozens of gazes turned toward him.

"Master!" Yang Kai immediately spotted Ling Taixu in the crowd and hurried over, calling out with delight.

Ling Taixu smiled and inclined his head, but he looked severely wounded: his face pale as paper, his body trembling.

Yang Kai's heart tightened and he hurried to ask about it.

"It's nothing serious. That man Wu Zheng struck me with a palm but didn't attempt to kill me; otherwise I couldn't stand here now," Ling Taixu reassured him.

Without a word, Yang Kai placed his hand on Ling Taixu's wrist and examined him carefully.

After a moment, his face relaxed slightly.

Although Ling Taixu's injury was severe, it was not life-threatening. With Yang Kai's means, healing him would not be difficult.

"Master, take this pill." Yang Kai placed a pill into his hand.

Ling Taixu took it without hesitation, swallowed, and patted Yang Kai's shoulder. "We'll talk properly another day. I need to refine its medicinal efficacy first."

"All right."

"Master Ling, I'll see you out!" Fourth Master Yang quickly stepped forward and supported Ling Taixu as they departed.

"Senior Ling drew their attention so we could escape," Tu Feng suddenly spoke. "If not for Ling Taixu distracting them, we wouldn't have got away from the Yang Family."

"It's a pity we were almost taken back; thanks to the Young Master appearing in time, Senior Ling's efforts weren't wasted," Tang Yuxian lowered her head in shame.

"Don't worry about it. If Master Ling chose to act, he had his reasons. Isn't everything okay now?" Yang Kai smiled. "Come on in and sit; we'll talk."

In the main hall people jostled in and took seats. Those without seats stood nearby, every eye fixed on Yang Kai, waiting for him to speak.

"Second Brother, did the family suffer losses this time?" Yang Kai sat casually and asked Yang Zhao.

At the question, everyone's faces fell; Yang Kai's heart sank.

"The biggest loss was the Blood Servants Hall," Yang Zhao sighed heavily. "When those invaders arrived we had no idea how formidable they were. The Blood Servants Hall leader Feng Sheng and deputy leader Zhou Feng were killed, and the whole Hall was scattered."

The Blood Servants Hall was the most loyal institution to the Yang Family, a place where the family's cultivated elites gathered.

In times of peril, they naturally fought with all their might.

Yang Kai remembered the Hall leader Feng Sheng and deputy Zhou Feng from past dealings, but he had not expected them to fall in this invasion.

Tu Feng clenched his fists, his body trembling as he choked out names: "Qu Gaoyi, Ji Li, Xiao Shun, Luo Hai, Fu Cong... they are all dead."

Yang Kai's body jolted.

The names Tu Feng listed were Blood Servants who had followed Yang Kai during the Succession War. In the final stages of that conflict, Yang Kai had gathered thirteen Blood Servants and forged thirteen Transcendent Realm experts.

Especially Qu Gaoyi, who, along with Ying Jiu, had been with Yang Kai from the beginning — the two were the most loyal and the most gifted within the Blood Servants Hall.

Hearing those all-too-familiar names were gone, Yang Kai felt a sharp pang in his chest.
