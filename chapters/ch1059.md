## Chapter 1059 — Chew It Up and Feed It

When they were still thirty li from the valley, Halika halted, mumbled for a long while, and finally said, “Young Brother, I’ll wait here for you. If the matter cannot be done, leave at once and do not entangle yourself. Master Zong Ao dislikes people like this most of all; if you anger him, the consequences are unimaginable.”

Yang Kai glanced him up and down. Halika looked embarrassed and explained, “Young Brother, you’re young and your cultivation is low. Even if Master Zong Ao is angry, he probably wouldn’t lower himself to strike you. But if I go along with you…”

“Understood.” Yang Kai guessed his worry and didn’t insist; clutching Xue Yue, he departed like lightning.

Halika remained where he was, craning his neck and staring ahead with pleading eyes, his heart uneasy—he didn’t know whether Yang Kai’s trip would succeed or whether he’d be beaten senseless by Zong Ao.

Thirty li—before he knew it Yang Kai had arrived.

Yang Kai went straight to the front of the palace and called out in a clear voice, “Senior, my Lady has suffered a grave calamity and remains unconscious. I have heard that you are the most outstanding Alchemist on Rainfall Star, so I have come to ask for your aid. I humbly beg Senior to grant us this favor and examine my Lady’s condition.”

Inside the palace it was dead quiet. Yang Kai could sense life stirring within; the alchemist named Zong Ao was indeed inside, but there was no response.

He called three times in succession with no change.

Far away, Halika’s heart nearly leapt into his throat. He silently resolved that if Zong Ao burst out in fury, he would flee immediately and not linger.

Outside the palace, Yang Kai waited anxiously.

Eccentric masters often had strange tempers; Yang Kai understood that and therefore did not act rashly. Even Halika and Lin Mufeng and others feared this Zong Ao. A young warrior of the Second Stage of the Saint Realm who provoked him would have no good end, so Yang Kai stood outside holding Xue Yue and spoke respectfully while awaiting Zong Ao’s reply.

He was also considering what to do if Zong Ao refused to come out.

Xue Yue lay unconscious; he could not leave her be. Their lives were linked—if anything befell her while she slept, he could not survive alone.

So Yang Kai was impatient to wake Xue Yue and then break the Soul Chain to restore her freedom.

Just as he vacillated, an old voice suddenly called from within the palace: “Come in!”

Yang Kai was startled—he hadn’t expected things to go so smoothly. Surprise showed on his face. Listening closely to Zong Ao’s tone, he found no resentment or anger. He then stepped into the palace.

The palace doors stood wide and there were no guards or servants in sight; across thousands of li, it seemed Zong Ao was the only living person.

After walking a way through the palace, Yang Kai reached a huge chamber. A rich scent of medicine drifted from within. He crept inside and looked around; his eyes involuntarily narrowed.

This chamber must be Zong Ao’s alchemy room.

At this moment dozens of pill furnaces large and small were placed in the room, each still warm—apparently he had just finished refining pills not long ago.

In one corner of the chamber, a mound of jade bottles had been piled up, each filled with pills of various colors and types—a spectacular sight.

Yang Kai estimated roughly that the pile contained at least two hundred bottles, carelessly strewn on the ground as if they were worthless trinkets.

He was secretly shocked. Halika’s words had not been false; Zong Ao’s pill production was indeed terrifying.

At that moment Zong Ao sat in a beast-skin chair, holding a jade bottle as if inspecting it.

After examining it and finding nothing he wanted, Zong Ao casually tossed the bottle into a nearby corner among the others.

He had another ten or so jade bottles by his side.

Checking them one by one, Zong Ao’s brow brightened as he muttered to himself, “Another one, hehe, not bad—not wasted my effort. Ah, pills are hard to refine…”

Saying so, he took a pill from a bottle and placed it into another pre-prepared jade bottle.

Yang Kai watched closely and saw that the pills in that bottle all bore pill patterns.

It seemed Zong Ao kept only pills that had formed pill patterns; the rest he discarded like old shoes, indifferent to their grades or value.

While Zong Ao inspected the pills, Yang Kai remained quiet and did not interrupt, just standing there.

After a while Zong Ao finished, gathered those pills with patterns into his bosom, looked up at Yang Kai, and sneered, “You’re the brat who stole techniques from my medicinal field before, aren’t you?”

Yang Kai reddened and replied awkwardly, “A few days ago I passed by and was drawn to the mysteries of that medicinal field. I couldn’t help but stop and study for some days. If I offended, please forgive me, Senior.”

Stealing techniques was always despicable; Yang Kai knew he’d been unfair.

At that time he hadn’t thought much of it. Now the other pursued the matter and he had no defense.

“Hm.” Zong Ao was somewhat satisfied with Yang Kai’s honest admission. He rose from his chair and chuckled, “Forget it, it’s not a big matter. You’re lucky today; I’ve just finished refining pills and have some gains. Since you’re an alchemist as well, I won’t pursue it.”

Only another alchemist could comprehend the mysteries of a medicinal field; Zong Ao understood this better than anyone.

“What’s the matter with your Lady?” Zong Ao asked proactively.

Yang Kai’s expression turned solemn: “Unconscious, life sealed, mind scattered, the spirit body is nowhere to be found!”

“You entered her Sea of Consciousness?” Zong Ao asked in surprise.

Yang Kai nodded lightly.

Zong Ao burst into a strange laugh: “You and that girl have more than a simple relationship.”

He looked at Yang Kai with a leering expression, his smile suggestive.

Only someone very intimate would venture into another’s Sea of Consciousness to peer inside; if Yang Kai were truly Xue Yue’s guardian, he wouldn’t dare such a transgression.

Zong Ao, clever with age, saw through the winding reasonings.

Yang Kai did not deny it and simply said, “Please, Senior, grant your aid!”

Zong Ao curled his mouth: “Halika even came along—this girl’s status must be high. Have the other alchemists on Rainfall Star been helpless?”

“We already invited a dozen or so, and they knew nothing.”

“A bunch of useless folk who only know how to refine pills!” Zong Ao spat scornfully and sauntered to Yang Kai’s side. He inspected Xue Yue’s state and swept his divine sense over her. Suddenly his expression turned grave.

Yang Kai clearly felt his divine sense strengthen; he seemed to have discovered something.

Seeing that, Yang Kai held his breath and waited.

Zong Ao’s expression shifted—hesitant, exhilarated, then almost mad. His eyes widened and after a long while he declared in a low voice, “Brat, is this girl harmed by Profound Yin Moon Water?”

His tone was uncertain, clearly not daring to be too definitive.

Even so, Yang Kai couldn’t help admiring him. Those ten or so alchemists had gathered and investigated for a long time without finding Xue Yue’s cause, but Zong Ao had pinpointed the root at a glance—he truly had real skill. Yang Kai nodded soberly: “Yes.”

“It really is Profound Yin Moon Water?” Zong Ao shouted, a little out of control.

“Exactly Profound Yin Moon Water!”

“Ha!” Zong Ao’s face twitched with excitement and elation. He laughed loudly, “It is Profound Yin Moon Water! Does this thing truly exist?”

He gesticulated excitedly, shouting without cease, then suddenly seized Yang Kai’s arm like iron and his eyes flared with a chilling light. Urgently he demanded, “Brat, where is the Profound Yin Moon Water? Take me to it at once!”

“Please, Senior, save her first!” Yang Kai stood firm.

“You bargain with me?” Zong Ao’s face turned cold and displeasure showed. His gaze pressed on Yang Kai and he icily said, “Killing you would be as easy as turning my hand—how dare you bargain with me?”

“Please forgive me, Senior!” Yang Kai persisted.

Zong Ao fell a little into a daze, his eyes appraising Yang Kai oddly, and he sneered, “You have nerve! No one’s dared speak to me like this for many years. Looks like that girl truly matters to you—would you give your life for her?”

Yang Kai knit his brows and said, “If she dies, I die.”

Those were not lies, so Yang Kai spoke without burden.

Whether his words touched some nerve in Zong Ao, the man’s oppressive aura weakened. He pondered a moment, then nodded, “Fine, follow me.”

Saying so, he led Yang Kai through the palace.

Before long they reached another chamber. Zong Ao instructed Yang Kai to lay Xue Yue on the bed, handed him a brown pill, and said, “Make her take this.”

Yang Kai pried Xue Yue’s mouth open and was about to drop the pill in.

Zong Ao rolled his eyes: “Chew it up and feed it! Her strength can’t circulate now—if you don’t help neutralize the medicine’s effect, how can she absorb it?”

Yang Kai stared at Zong Ao in astonishment.

Zong Ao laughed with crude amusement: “Too embarrassed? If so, I can excuse myself.”

“No need.” Yang Kai shook his head, put the pill in his mouth, chewed it, then pressed his mouth to Xue Yue’s and fed it into her lips, acting calmly.

He had already touched and seen Xue Yue’s entire body—what was one more kiss now?

Her lips were icy cool yet soft; after feeding the pill, Yang Kai straightened and oddly felt a lingering savor.

“Get away!” Zong Ao brusquely shoved Yang Kai aside, holding a vessel filled with a jade-green liquid that boiled and bubbled inside.

Yang Kai had no idea what that jade-green liquid was.

Seeing Zong Ao so confident, Yang Kai did not ask further and stood aside to wait.
