## Chapter 1308 — Black Crow City

Black Crow City could not compare to those great cities, so even though Shen Fanlei was only a disciple of the Jidao Sect at the Saint King Realm, he had some connections with a senior who watched over the Space Array guarding the city; he had been entrusted by that person once to do a small favor, so it was unlikely the man would refuse him this time. Knowing this, Yang Kai relaxed—using the Space Array should be fine, not nearly as troublesome as returning last time from Demon Blood City.

That said, traveling across Dark Star truly required having some connections. Otherwise, just gaining access to the Space Arrays within the various cities would already be an enormous headache.

Luckily Yang Kai's luck held—both times he came back from outside, someone had stepped forward to help.

He wondered whether any kind of pass existed that allowed free use of Space Arrays across the entire Dark Star; if such a thing existed, it would be immeasurably convenient.

Yang Kai had thought nothing like that would exist, but when he asked casually he was shocked to learn from Shen Shitao that such a pass really did exist! This surprised him greatly, and he hurried to ask more.

Shen Shitao seemed to know what he was thinking and naturally spoke without holding anything back.

After Shen Shitao's explanation, Yang Kai could only smile bitterly and shake his head repeatedly.

Although such a pass did indeed exist and was recognized by about eighty percent of the forces on Dark Star, acquiring it was nearly impossible. There were two ways: one, accomplish a grand deed beneficial to the entire Dark Star. That condition sounded simple but in practice was utterly unattainable.

Forces on Dark Star were as numerous as oxen; though they cooperated at times, they were beset by constant conflicts. What benefited one side might harm another. With so many voices, trying to satisfy all was a fool's dream, so achieving that first condition was absurd.

The second method was far simpler: gather ten first-tier sects and have them jointly vouch for you. That could secure a pass allowing unobstructed travel across Dark Star.

That method was easier only in comparison to the first. After all, there weren't many first-tier sects on Dark Star—at most twenty—so assembling ten to guarantee someone was virtually impossible.

The sects Yang Kai had contact with—Yingyue Hall, Qiantian Sect, and Liuli Sect—were all first-tier and qualified for such guarantees. The guarantors, however, had to be respected elder-level figures within those sects.

Both routes could obtain the pass Yang Kai wanted, but after hearing Shen Shitao he extinguished the notion; with his current strength he couldn't meet either condition.

Time flew during their conversation. Five days later, the six of them smoothly arrived at Black Crow City and, after paying some Saint Crystals, the guards at the gate readily let them through.

Once inside, Yang Kai looked around and saw roads of varying widths crisscrossing the city, flanked by countless shops. The martial artists coming and going weren't countless like carp in a river, but the place was bustling enough to seem lively.

"Brother Yang, are you planning to stay here a while or leave in a hurry?" Shen Shitao suddenly turned and glanced at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai thought a moment and said, "If possible, I'd like to leave as soon as I can. I still have some matters to handle."

On this trip they had gained so many materials and Saint Crystals, and the Stone Puppet had stolen a great deal of Thousand Illusions Glaze, so Yang Yan was eager to throw herself into her artificing career. She said she intended to forge something that would shock the world. Yang Kai asked what exactly she planned to make, but Yang Yan answered mysteriously and evasively, leaving him helpless.

Even without mentioning Yang Yan, the situations of the Stone Puppet and the Artifact Spirit—two capable assistants—made Yang Kai unwilling to linger outside. Only by returning to Dragon Lair Mountain could he truly rest, letting those two recuperate thoroughly.

Hearing this, Shen Shitao's eyes flashed with a hint of disappointment, but she didn't press further. Instead she said, "Then Fanlei will go to the Space Array and see if that senior is there. If all goes well, Brother Yang, you should be able to leave before nightfall."

Yang Kai had no objection and politely asked Shen Fanlei for the favor. He then stood with Shen Shitao and the others and waited quietly.

During the waiting, Shen Shitao again attempted to invite Yang Kai to participate in Qiantian Sect's trial, but he politely declined. Seeing that, Shen Shitao didn't press and instead chatted with him pleasantly about other matters.

About an hour later, Shen Fanlei returned.

But his face looked awkward, as if he had failed in his errand.

Seeing that expression, Yang Kai felt a chill in his heart and secretly guessed they might not be able to persuade the senior. If so, flying back to Dragon Lair Mountain would take two to three months.

Shen Shitao seemed to suspect the same. When her brother arrived she hurriedly asked, "Fanlei, was it unsuccessful?"

Shen Fanlei forced a smile, guilt flickering across his face, and shook his head, "Not very successful."

"What happened?" Shen Shitao pressed.

"That senior happened not to be in the city. I asked around and learned he apparently took a task and left the city."

"He left the city?" Shen Shitao stared in surprise. "How coincidental that he left now—surely you weren't brushed off?"

"No, no!" Shen Fanlei hurriedly waved. "I checked with others and indeed that senior had a mission and left a few days ago. It seems he won't be back for at least three days."

"Three days..." Shen Shitao muttered, then turned to Yang Kai with an apologetic smile. "Brother Yang, sorry—things were a bit more complicated. I hope this doesn't disappoint you."

"No matter, unexpected things happen," Yang Kai replied lightly.

Seeing no displeasure on Yang Kai's face, Shen Shitao relaxed and said, "But that senior will take at least three days to return. Could you wait a few days here? Rest assured, once he returns we'll arrange your departure."

"Three days isn't a problem; even ten would be fine. It's certainly better than Yang Yan and I flying for two or three months. But Brother Shen, can you be sure he won't delay longer? If it drags on it wouldn't be worth it."

"That's fine too," Shen Shitao smiled coyly. "If he hasn't returned after three days we'll go elsewhere. Whether it's Jidao Sect's Liefeng City or our Qiantian Sect's Haicheng City, both are only ten days to half a month away. Those cities also have Space Arrays directly linked to Tianyun City. Here we still need to call in favors, but in Liefeng or Haicheng we can act on our own."

Yang Kai brightened at this and his last hesitation vanished. He nodded in agreement with Shen Shitao's suggestion.

Since they decided to wait here for three days, they naturally needed lodgings. Fortunately Black Crow City had many inns, and Shen Shitao and Lü Ying were well-off women with at least a million Saint Crystals each, so their chosen lodgings wouldn't be poor.

After a short while, the six of them checked into a top-tier inn called Feiling Hall.

Feiling Hall was famous in Black Crow City, the finest inn. Those who stayed were either rich or noble, each not to be underestimated, and a night's stay cost at least three thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals.

The price was exorbitant; ordinary inns charged only a few hundred Saint Crystals for their best rooms, but Feiling Hall's rates were dozens of times higher.

If not for Yang Kai's help twice on this trip—and the last time a life-saving favor—Shen Shitao wouldn't have splurged. Though she had many Saint Crystals, she wasn't extravagant; this time she was enjoying luxury on Yang Kai's account.

Despite the outrageous price, once settled in everyone felt it was worth it.

The reason was simple: each guest occupied a private pavilion divided into three floors—the first for receiving visitors, the second for meditation and cultivation, and the third containing an alchemy room and an artificing room for resident alchemists and artificers to use.

Each floor was arrayed with at least seven seals that could block others' Divine Sense and also serve as alarms.

In each pavilion two young, beautiful, slender maidens served the guest. They were martial artists of modest cultivation—mostly True Yuan Realm, some at the Separation and Union Realm—trained to satisfy most guest requests, though excessive demands would be refused.

The attendant casually revealed that Feiling Hall belonged to the city lord and several elders, so its security was reliable and no one would dare cause trouble there.

That casual hint carried a warning: do not underestimate the inn's background or cause a disturbance.

The six did not need six pavilions; Shen Shitao took the main three. She and Lü Ying shared one, Wang Yuhan and Shen Fanlei another, and Yang Kai naturally stayed with Yang Yan.

After dividing up, everyone dispersed to their pavilions to rest.

The pavilion Yang Kai and Yang Yan occupied was exquisitely built and given a sentimental name: Flying Flowers, Snow, and Moon Pavilion.

Yang Yan sneered at that, and Yang Kai had no special thoughts either. The two chose separate rooms and sat down to meditate.
