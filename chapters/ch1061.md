## Chapter 1061 — Five-Colored Meteor Essence

Zong Ao's cultivation was also at the Origin Returning Realm stage; he wasn't necessarily stronger than Halika, Lin Mufeng, and the others—he was even weaker than them in places—but because for a century he had been continuously refining pills for the Hengluo Commerce Guild without charging a single coin, and had produced a phenomenal number of pills, he therefore rose to an exalted status. Chairman Ai Ou paid him close attention and ordered Halika and the others to treat Zong Ao as the guild's honored benefactor, showing him no slights.

It could be said that on Rainfall Star, no one held a higher social standing than Zong Ao!

That was why these Origin Returning Realm experts approached Zong Ao with such extreme caution and dared not be even slightly careless.

Knowing full well that Zong Ao intended to snatch something as treasured for cultivation as Profound Yin Moon Water, they dared not show any attitude, and dared not act rashly; they could only beg him again and again to show mercy.

The three took turns pleading and wore out their tongues, but Zong Ao remained unmoved. Finally irritated by their pestering, he broke into a tirade of vicious curses—so filthy and cutting that Halika and the others did not dare to retort and could only bear it with sullen faces.

After cursing for a time he stopped, glanced at the three, and sneered coldly, "Don't think I don't know—your affairs here would never be reported to the main star. At the very least, while that girl remains intact, you dare not report it; you only hide the news. Even if I snatch the Profound Yin Moon Water, what are you going to do, bite me?"

Hearing that, Halika and the others exchanged bitter smiles and dared not answer.

"Treasure belongs to those who are capable of taking it," Zong Ao said haughtily as he looked at them. "Put it a thousand steps back—if I had no intention of taking the Profound Yin Moon Water, would you have collected it? Would you have known how to collect it? If you don't understand how to take it, you'll forever only watch meat arrive at your lips and never be able to eat."

"Master speaks the truth…" Halika no longer quibbled and responded bitterly.

The middle-aged woman, catching the tone beneath his words, looked at Zong Ao with some delight and asked, "Master, you know how to gather Profound Yin Moon Water?"

"Why else would I come if I didn't?" Zong Ao snorted, waved his hand, and said, "Make way, make way—deal with whatever you need to after I collect those things."

He paid no further heed to Halika and the others; lifting Yang Kai, he strode toward the pit and dropped in—vanishing in the blink of an eye like a shameless thief.

Halika and Lin Mufeng glanced at each other, clenched their teeth, and could only follow.

Inside the mine, Yang Kai trailed behind Zong Ao, guiding his steps.

The last time Yang Kai had entered alone he relied on tearing through space and penetrated into the ancient ruin's interior without much trouble, but this time that method would not work.

The ruin hid all manner of perilous, venomous restrictions; when Halika and Xue Yue led people to scout previously, many warriors had been lost along the way.

But Zong Ao was clearly no ordinary man. He walked at the front, holding in his hand a pentagonal crystal-like object that emitted brilliant light in shimmering rays, illuminating the dark tunnel in perfect detail. The light was blinding.

From time to time faint, hard-to-detect energy reactions pulsed from the sides; each time this happened Zong Ao grew extremely cautious, steering Yang Kai away from those reactive areas.

The five-sided crystal seemed to have a detecting function; using it Zong Ao could avoid many unknown dangers. Though his pace was slow, there was no worry of peril, and they advanced inward with ease.

The air grew steadily colder. A thin layer of ice appeared on the stone walls of the mine.

Zong Ao's expression grew excited—he knew the Profound Yin Moon Water was drawing ever nearer.

Halika and the others trailed not far behind Zong Ao and Yang Kai, following the path they had forged. They discussed by Divine Sense how to handle the situation, but after long debate could devise no satisfactory plan and were anxious.

“Boy, which way do we go now?” Zong Ao stopped at a fork in the path and turned to ask Yang Kai.

"This way!" Yang Kai casually pointed in a direction; his Divine Sense Threads had long pierced space and located where the Profound Yin Moon Water lay.

Zong Ao did not hesitate and strode down that branch.

After delving half a day's journey further, Zong Ao suddenly shivered, squinted at what lay ahead, and his body trembled uncontrollably as a feverish light filled his eyes.

The Profound Yin Moon Water—dozens of droplets of it hovered eerily in midair, maintaining the state they had been in when Yang Kai left, waiting for the fated one to take them.

"So it truly is Profound Yin Moon Water!" Zong Ao swept his Divine Sense over them and immediately sensed the extraordinary nature of those droplets. Though suspended in midair each drop felt as weighty as a mountain, containing terrifying potential power.

In this world, aside from the Profound Yin Moon Water, there exists no other substance possessing such a property.

He took a couple quick steps and stood before the dozens of droplets, eyes glittering like jewels as he circled them, clicking his tongue in appreciation.

That Zong Ao should lose his composure thus showed just how immense the value of the Profound Yin Moon Water was.

Yang Kai, however, looked calm and unmoved, standing where he was with no intention of coveting or seizing the Profound Yin Moon Water.

He understood his own strength. Not to mention Zong Ao, even those following behind—Halika and the others—were all Origin Returning Realm experts. Yang Kai had some self-awareness in their presence.

Footsteps sounded as Halika and the others emerged one by one and stood beside Yang Kai, looking toward the treasures with bitter expressions.

The dozens of droplets of Profound Yin Moon Water filled their vision and reddened each of their eyes.

This substance was a cultivation treasure; if one safely refined even a single drop, any warrior would gain a tremendous increase in power—even Origin Returning Realm experts like Halika could be greatly enhanced.

At their level of cultivation, advancing further was harder than ascending to the heavens; it could take centuries, even thousands of years, to break through a small Stage without sufficient opportunity.

Refining Profound Yin Moon Water was fraught with danger, but there is no reward without cost.

Each of them had lived through countless life-and-death battles, awakening Dao and martial insights on the brink of death and rising step by step to their current heights. They knew better than anyone that the greater the danger, the greater the reward.

Yet now they could only watch from afar and dared not step forward.

"Was the Profound Yin Moon Water sealed inside a Spatial Ring when it was discovered?" Zong Ao asked suddenly.

Yang Kai had briefly explained the situation to him, but he did not know much; what Yang Kai knew was naturally limited.

"Yes, Master," Halika's spirit stirred and he hastily replied.

"Hoarding heavenly treasures—what greed!" Zong Ao sneered. "Such things actually packed into a Spatial Ring—those ancient folk were ignorant indeed. Still, thanks to their ignorance; otherwise the Profound Yin Moon Water might have long since sunk out of reach."

The others listened, bewildered, not understanding what he meant.

Lin Mufeng cupped his fist and said, "Please enlighten us, Master."

Zong Ao grinned and said, "Profound Yin Moon Water—each drop weighs like a mountain, far beyond what a Spatial Ring can contain. When those ancients sealed the Profound Yin Moon Water into a Spatial Ring, they likely died without ever using the ring; otherwise the ring would have exploded and the water would not have remained until now."

Halika hurriedly responded, "It was because the Spatial Ring ruptured that we were taken unawares and suffered heavy casualties."

"That is only natural," Zong Ao chuckled strangely. "Moreover, once these things touch soil they will keep sinking downward. Do you know why Profound Yin Moon Water is so rare?"

Everyone shook their heads, showing they did not grasp the insider truth.

"Because they all sink into the depths of the earth and are absorbed by the Stellar Origin; thus they become hard to find. Not only Profound Yin Moon Water, but other precious heaven-and-earth treasures can also be absorbed by the Stellar Origin."

At these words the group was stunned.

They were familiar with the Stellar Origin—the heart of every cultivator star—but none had known there was any connection between the Stellar Origin and Profound Yin Moon Water.

"What luck," Zong Ao inhaled deeply. "These dozens of drops were fortunate not to have touched soil, otherwise they'd be gone already." He suddenly produced from his Spatial Ring a strangely shaped vessel.

The vessel looked somewhat like a vase and somewhat like a bowl—narrow neck, broad belly, odd and curious—its surface shimmering with five colors, radiating dazzling light and extraordinary beauty.

"Five-Colored Meteor Essence!" Halika exclaimed in a low voice; at a glance he recognized what mineral the vessel was made from.

Lin Mufeng and the middle-aged woman couldn't help but be slightly moved as well.

Yang Kai read the signs and immediately understood that the Five-Colored Meteor Essence must be an extremely valuable ore; otherwise these three Origin Returning Realm experts would not be so unsteady.

"Indeed, it's Five-Colored Meteor Essence," Zong Ao laughed. "Few know that Five-Colored Meteor Essence is precisely the nemesis of Profound Yin Moon Water. If you want to collect Profound Yin Moon Water, you only need to fashion a vessel from Five-Colored Meteor Essence!"

He laughed as he aimed the vessel at a droplet of Profound Yin Moon Water and channeled his power to draw it into the container, showing not the slightest bit of restraint.

Halika and the others' faces turned ugly; their skin twitched and their emotions ran complex.

Although Five-Colored Meteor Essence was precious, the Hengluo Commerce Guild did possess some; though not in great quantity, making a vessel would not have been impossible. Had they known this earlier they would have taken the Profound Yin Moon Water themselves and not waited for Zong Ao to take advantage.

They had let a monumental opportunity slip by, and Halika had even lost an arm over it.

At that thought the expressions of the three shifted in a most revealing way.

Zong Ao ignored how Halika and the others felt and continued collecting the Profound Yin Moon Water until only ten droplets remained. He then solemnly held the vessel in his hands, cast a sidelong look at Halika and the others, and said, "Don't say I gnaw the meat and spit out the bones without giving you even the soup—these remaining drops of Profound Yin Moon Water are for you to figure out how to collect. Just don't tell me you can't find any Five-Colored Meteor Essence."
