## Chapter 2362 — Don’t Push Me

“Take me out first, and everything can be discussed.” Yang Kai looked at Yao Changjun with a cheerful smile. “Or, you can just tell me how to get out.”

“Brat, you dare bargain with this old man!” Yao Changjun’s expression turned angry.

Yang Kai said, “I’m just afraid you’ll swindle me, Senior!”

“With my status, how could I do something so shameless?” Yao Changjun snorted coldly.

Yang Kai shook his head. “That’s hard to say. What if you don’t even know how to get out, Senior? Wouldn’t I be a fool to hand over the Spiritual Herb for nothing?”

Pang Guang shouted angrily, “You little bastard, Senior Yao asking you to hand over the Spiritual Herb is giving you face. If you don’t cooperate, you’re courting death!”

Yang Kai and Yao Changjun both turned and snorted, “None of your damn business!”

Pang Guang’s face burned with embarrassment. His attempt to curry favor had completely backfired, leaving him awkward and ill at ease.

Yang Kai sized up Yao Changjun for a moment and sneered. “Looks like Senior can barely save himself, yet he still dares to boast about taking me out. Laughable, truly laughable.”

Just by looking at Yao Changjun’s current demeanor, Yang Kai could tell he didn’t know how to leave this damned place either.

If Yao Changjun really had a way out, it wouldn’t be impossible to trade the Butian Lotus for it. The key was that this old guy couldn’t get out himself, so how could he take Yang Kai with him?

Exposed by Yang Kai, Yao Changjun wasn’t angry at all. He just said blandly, “With my cultivation, how could a mere secret realm trap me? I’ll find a way out sooner or later.”

“Then let’s talk when you find the way out.”

“Are you handing it over or not?” Yao Changjun had clearly lost his patience. His old face was now extremely dark.

“What do you think?” Yang Kai looked completely unconcerned.

“Very well!” Yao Changjun took a deep breath, killing intent rising.

But instead of attacking Yang Kai immediately, he suddenly turned his gaze to Pang Guang.

Pang Guang, who had been enjoying the show, suddenly felt Yao Changjun’s cold gaze. He shuddered and stammered, “Senior…”

“Scram!” Yao Changjun roared, “Or I’ll kill you too!”

His voice surged like a wave, stabbing at Pang Guang like a spear. Pang Guang trembled all over and staggered back several steps, his face turning pale.

“Senior, I can help you capture this brat!” Pang Guang quickly pledged his loyalty. Having suddenly fallen into this Jixu Secret Realm, his First Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivation gave him no sense of security. He just wanted to cling to Yao Changjun’s thigh, but the other party gave him no face or chance, telling him to get lost as soon as he opened his mouth.

Yao Changjun snorted coldly, “If I wanted your help, I’d ask. If you don’t leave now… you’ll never leave!”

Pang Guang was shocked. He gritted his teeth, glanced at Yang Kai, then at Yao Changjun, finally stomped his foot and shot off into the depths of the sea.

He didn’t know why Yao Changjun was so eager to drive him away, but he knew the other party was truly impatient. If he kept pestering, he’d definitely provoke killing intent.

With his cultivation, he stood no chance against Yao Changjun.

He could only run for his life first.

Although the sea didn’t look peaceful—in fact, it was full of dangers, and he didn’t even know which way to run—it was still better than staying here waiting to die.

In less than ten breaths, Pang Guang had disappeared without a trace.

“You were so eager to drive Pang Guang away—are you afraid he’d notice your Divine Soul is injured?” Yang Kai looked at Yao Changjun with a smile and asked lightly.

Yao Changjun’s face changed dramatically, a dangerous glint flashing in his narrowed eyes. “So that sneak attack of yours before wasn’t just luck!”

Yang Kai laughed loudly. “The Butian Lotus’s effect is nothing more than repairing broken Meridians, Dantian, and Sea of Consciousness. Senior, you look full of vigor and your Emperor Yuan is abundant, so clearly your Meridians and Dantian are fine. You’re so desperate for the Butian Lotus, it must be to repair your Sea of Consciousness.”

“You’re so knowledgeable about medicinal arts?” Yao Changjun was a bit surprised. To deduce his Divine Soul was injured from such clues—this brat was clearly no ordinary person.

“I’m just a humble Imperial-Grade Alchemist!” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Yao Changjun’s expression shifted, but he quickly snorted, “Do I look like an idiot to you?”

He clearly thought Yang Kai was talking nonsense.

Yang Kai was still so young—having reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was already enough to astonish anyone. But to claim he was also an Imperial-Grade Alchemist? Yao Changjun scoffed at such an idea.

Yang Kai might be an alchemist—otherwise, he couldn’t be so skilled in pharmacology—but he definitely wasn’t an Imperial-Grade Alchemist.

He figured Yang Kai was just trying to get him to spare his life. After all, even if he got the Butian Lotus, he’d need an alchemist to refine a Spiritual Pill, and an Imperial-Grade Alchemist was the best choice.

This brat was full of tricks and schemes! Yao Changjun grew extremely wary.

Yang Kai was taken aback, then shook his head with a wry smile. “Senior, your Divine Soul is injured, so your intelligence really is affected. It’s an illness, and illnesses must be treated.”

He spoke sincerely, but the other party refused to believe him, leaving him both amused and helpless.

“No matter how eloquent you are today, you must hand over the Butian Lotus!” Yao Changjun snorted coldly.

Yang Kai’s face turned cold. “I said, tell me how to get out of here first. If you can’t even do that, don’t expect to get anything. I’d rather feed it to a dog than give it to you.”

Yao Changjun’s face twisted with rage as Yang Kai compared him to a dog. “You little brat, you’re courting death! My patience has its limits,” he snapped, his anger barely contained.

Yang Kai said lazily, “Third Stage of the Emperor Realm? I’m not afraid of you. Don’t push me. If you do, you won’t get anything good either!”

Yao Changjun was stunned. Deep down, he felt a sense of absurdity. A Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm dared to talk so boldly in front of him—unbelievable! Yet this brat’s expression was utterly sincere, without a hint of guilt.

What’s going on? Could this brat really fight him? What was he relying on—those mysterious space abilities? If so, he could only run away, nothing to fear.

Yao Changjun’s mind was in turmoil. He couldn’t figure it out, but grew both angry and embarrassed. “Since you don’t know what’s good for you, I’ll grant your wish!”

He tapped his foot lightly, his figure flickering like a ghost as he closed in on Yang Kai. Forming a seal with one hand, he pointed gracefully toward where Yang Kai stood.

That single finger carried a vast, majestic force, as if the power of heaven and earth pressed down.

After all, Yao Changjun was a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert. Though his Divine Soul was injured, his Martial Dao foundation was still solid. This finger, though not a named technique, was extremely fierce, containing his understanding of the Martial Dao.

Even before the finger arrived, it carried a world-breaking momentum. The power of the Law swirled around it, as if Yao Changjun was the master of this world.

Seeing that he was really attacking, Yang Kai’s expression changed. He could no longer hesitate. His Origin Qi roared as he stuffed the unconscious Liu Qianyun into the Small Xuan Realm, then unleashed both Dragon Transformation and Undying Five Elements Sword, space power surging as he tried to escape.

Hiss—

With a soft sound, Yang Kai reappeared dozens of zhang away, but his shoulder blade now had a gaping bloody hole. Golden blood gushed out, and a stabbing pain shot through him.

“Hmm?” Yao Changjun was startled, surprise flashing across his face.

He was surprised not only that Yang Kai had avoided a fatal blow, but also at where Liu Qianyun had gone.

He’d been watching Yang Kai, paying little attention to the unconscious woman in his hand, but even he hadn’t noticed how she disappeared.

It was truly strange. Though his Divine Soul was injured and he didn’t dare use his Divine Sense lightly, his eyesight wasn’t so poor that someone could vanish before him.

"Old dog, you really want to fight me?" Yang Kai’s aura was violent, half his body was quickly soaked in blood. But not only did that blow not make him afraid, it seemed to ignite his ferocity, making him like a cornered beast.

For no reason, Yao Changjun felt a chill in his heart. He had a vague sense that if he kept pushing, something terrible would happen. The feeling was inexplicable, but made his hair stand on end.

But once the bow is drawn, there’s no turning back. He’d already injured Yang Kai—there was no point in stopping now. If he suddenly gave up, wouldn’t that mean he was afraid?

“Not bad, brat. You managed to dodge my attack—you’re a dragon among men! Heaven cherishes talent, and so do I. I’ll give you one more chance: hand over the Butian Lotus, and I’ll spare your life!”

“Get lost!”

“Very well!” Yao Changjun was furious. “Since you’re so stubborn, I’ll teach you a lesson!”

His hand gesture changed, Emperor Yuan surging. One side bound Yang Kai’s movements, while the other gathered wind and cloud power in his palm, striking fiercely at Yang Kai.

He didn’t hold back with this blow—he clearly intended to kill Yang Kai.

Boom—

With a loud bang, no matter how Yang Kai tried to defend, he was sent flying by the palm strike. Countless bones broke, his face turned pale, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Hahaha! Brat, you talk big, but this is all you’ve got? What a disappointment!” Seeing Yang Kai so miserable, Yao Changjun was reassured. He figured he’d been overthinking it—this brat was just a Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Even with some tricks, he couldn’t be a real threat. If he’d acted sooner, he could’ve finished him off already.

How shameful! To think a brat’s words had shaken his mind. Clearly, his Divine Soul injury had left aftereffects, Yao Changjun thought to himself.

Luckily, Yang Kai was only Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. If he had been as strong as Yao Changjun, he really wouldn't have gotten off easy.
