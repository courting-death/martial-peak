## Chapter 1300 — Underworld Spring

The secret cavern fell utterly silent for a time; the four Corpse Generals—each with strength rivaling the peak of the Origin Returning Realm—grew mute, and none of them moved to pursue Yang Kai. After all, he had ripped open the void and fled; no matter how strong they were, they could not hope to catch him unless they possessed the same space-rending method.

“Ah, that Sun’s True Essence is the key to our advancement to Corpse Kings, yet it’s been taken away—what are we to do now?” said a white-robed Corpse General, his brow deeply furrowed and his face full of frustration.

“Indeed. Without this Sun's True Essence, the final layer of our Corpse Refining Technique cannot proceed; we cannot ascend to the Corpse King and become an undying existence.” The black-clad Corpse General nodded in agreement, eyes flashing with murderous intent, clearly unwilling to let Yang Kai go so easily.

“No—no matter how versed in spatial force he is, I won’t let him leave. I’ll go fetch him back now.” The green-clad Corpse General ground his teeth, stamped his foot, and turned as if to give chase.

“Senior Brother Mo, have you forgotten those from Star Emperor Mountain? Though two thousand years have passed, if we leave now we will surely draw their attention. Besides, if that man is adept at spatial arts, how could he be easily pursued?” The white-clad Corpse General hurriedly blocked him.

At the mention of Star Emperor Mountain all three of the other Corpse Generals’ pupils contracted; dread surfaced, and in some even a hatred engraved deep into their bones. The green-clad Corpse General instantly dispelled his thought of pursuit.

The white-clad Corpse General gave a faint chuckle. “Although we’ve lost the Sun's True Essence, that may not be wholly a bad thing.”

“What?” The green-clad Corpse General stared at him in astonishment.

“Do any of you know why our Guyang Sect placed a Sun's True Essence here?” the white-clad Corpse General asked with a cryptic smile, his tone peculiarly eerie.

“Junior Brother Kang knows?”

The white-clad Corpse General did not answer directly. Instead, he cast a profound, inscrutable glance toward where the jade platform had stood and slowly said, “I could never be certain before, but now I am about eighty percent certain. Senior Brothers, take a look over there—see if you can sense anything.”

The other three Corpse Generals exchanged glances and, with suspicion, turned to peer in that direction, then released their Divine Sense to probe carefully.

A moment later, all three Corpse Generals suddenly shuddered, their expressions changing at once. The blue-robed Corpse General narrowed his eyes and exclaimed, “What a dense aura of Baleful Yin Qi! It seems to be sealed — only a trace of it is leaking out — yet even that faint wisp is far thicker than the Corpse Qi in this entire den.”

The red-clad and black-clad Corpse Generals remained silent, but their expressions brimmed with mingled surprise and delight; clearly, that Baleful Yin Qi meant everything to them.

The three turned their gazes to the white-clad Corpse General. The green-clad one asked, “Junior Brother Kang, you are the only blood-descendant of our Master. Do you know something? If so, do not play coy—speak plainly to your Senior Brothers.”

“Indeed, Kang—though we are older than you, how could we know the sect’s secrets better than you? When the sect was exterminated, we were only at the Saint Realm. If you had not led us here, we would long since have been scattered.”

Even the most arrogant-looking red-clad Corpse General softened his gaze toward the white-clad one and settled into a quiet, attentive manner.

The white-clad Corpse General gave a light laugh. “Those matters are in the past; do not concern yourselves. I led you here only by the Sect Master’s command, to preserve some of Guyang Sect’s legacy.”

At these words, all four of the Corpse Generals’ expressions dimmed.

Though the remnants of the sect’s flame had been barely preserved, the four Senior Brothers—once gallant and handsome—had now ended up like this; it was unknown whether they felt shame for failing the Sect Master’s past trust.

After a pause, the white-clad Corpse General steadied himself and continued, “Back then my strength was weak. Though the Sect Master was my father, I was not privy to many of the sect’s secrets. Yet once I overheard my parents discussing this secret cavern and learned of things unknown to others: it is said an Underworld Spring is sealed here.”

“Underworld Spring!” The three Corpse Generals cried out in horror.

“Indeed,” the white-clad one said solemnly. “Perhaps we did not know then what an Underworld Spring was, but now—you Senior Brothers surely do?”

“Of course!” the green-clad Corpse General nodded gravely. “That Underworld Spring is said to lead straight to the fabled Underworld. For beings such as ourselves, it is the most coveted Sacred Land for cultivation.”

“No wonder a Corpse Den appeared here—so there is an Underworld Spring,” the black-clad Corpse General murmured with comprehension.

“To seal that Underworld Spring, some past Sect Master of Guyang Sect used a Sun's True Essence—its solar blaze to pin the spring beneath it. Then later masters spent great cost to bring the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade platform to house it. This matter was one of the sect’s greatest secrets, known only to the Sect Master and a scant handful of elders.” The white-clad Corpse General finished, then chuckled dryly. “Although I overheard fragments, I knew little. With the Sun's True Essence pinned here, we could not approach, so I never told you Senior Brothers—please do not blame me.”

The green-clad Corpse General laughed heartily and slapped the white-clad one on the shoulder. “Junior Brother Kang, what are you talking about? We are brothers—how could we blame you? Besides, even if you had told us then, there was nothing we could have done. But now it truly seems there is an Underworld Spring here.”

“Yes—just the leaked Baleful Yin Qi is so dense. If the seal is broken, the benefits would be boundless. Using the Underworld Spring to forge the Corpse King form might not be impossible; it would be far safer than relying on the hazardous Sun's True Essence for the final layer.”

“Indeed. No one has ever cultivated the final layer of the Corpse Refining Technique, and it requires using the perilous Sun's True Essence. I have never approved of continuing that cultivation. Now that the problem is solved, we should thank the one who took the Sun's True Essence.”

The red-clad Corpse General fell silent for a long while before suddenly saying thoughtfully, “I always wondered why the sect would possess a Corpse Refining Technique, and you recall—Elder Liu once had several formidable corpse-thralls. It seems he cultivated them by exploiting this place.”

The Corpse Generals fell into quiet thought and nodded in agreement.

The blue-robed Corpse General waved his hand and said, “Enough. Now that we know an Underworld Spring lies here, our priority should be to find a way to break its seal. Without the Sun's True Essence suppressing it, opening it with our current strength shouldn’t be too difficult. But before that, this Sect Ruins must not be disturbed by outsiders again. If anyone notices something unusual, it might draw the attention of those from Star Emperor Mountain.”

“That’s simple enough — just let them out to stretch their limbs a bit,” the red-robed Corpse General said coldly with a sneer. “The experts outside already know this place’s situation. As long as they don’t leave the Sect Ruins, there shouldn’t be any major trouble.” As he turned to glance behind him, a vast host of Corpse Soldiers and Corpse Generals had appeared at some unknown point — densely packed, standing in eerie silence. Each exuded a sky-piercing killing intent, their eyes glowing green. Though their forms differed, the movement in their pupils made it clear these Corpse Soldiers and Corpse Generals all possessed their own intellect — and not a low one at that.

The top Corpse Generals immediately issued a string of orders. The Corpse Soldiers obeyed and broke into small groups, leaving the pit to spread out across Zangxiong Valley.

Meanwhile, far away, a fissure tore open the void some thousand li off. The rift was crooked and wild, unstable; a moment later a figure shot from it, followed almost instantly by another.

Almost as the second figure emerged, the rift in the void snapped shut.

Yang Kai turned his head with a face full of lingering fear; his expression had turned as dark as ink.

Though at the last instant he had used his space-rending method to spirit himself and Yang Yan away from a thousand li, the red-clad Corpse General’s attack had interfered with the rift’s stability. He and Yang Yan had nearly been lost within that tear. If not for his years of increasing understanding of spatial force, even if he himself might have escaped, Yang Yan would have surely died.

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat at the peril they’d faced; Yang Yan was entirely unaware. He vowed silently that next time he used this escape, he would first move to somewhere the enemy could not interfere, lest they leave behind eternal regrets.

Moreover, he could not tell whether it was his imagination, but the instant they left the Corpse Den he felt an unusual aura from where the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade platform had housed the Sun's True Essence.

Shaking his head and refraining from deeper thought, he felt fortunate simply to have escaped a peak Origin Returning Realm expert. And the haul from this venture had been enormous.

There was no time to inspect everything. Yang Kai only checked the Stone Puppet inside the Black Book Space briefly to ensure it was unharmed, then unleashed his Saint Yuan, wrapped Yang Yan, verified their direction, and dashed toward the outer reaches of Zangxiong Valley.

Yang Yan seemed quite shaken by what had occurred in the pit; she was silent the whole way, pressing herself close to Yang Kai, trembling.

She seemed to be timid by nature.

The journey encountered no further peril—aside from the Yin-Souls harried by Yang Kai’s Saint Yuan that pursued them, nothing impeded their flight. With Yang Kai so desperate to put distance between them and the place, those Yin-Souls could not catch up. In less than half a day the two had already covered most of the way.
