## Chapter 1675 — Dark Star's Great Calamity

When the Guyang Sect was annihilated back then, countless sect disciples were killed or injured, but for some reason those who died were reborn in an entirely new form — they became corpses that could cultivate, move, and fight.

On Dark Star, some of the younger generation probably did not know the situation inside Zangxiong Valley, but Qian Tong understood it.

Yang Kai also remembered; years ago he and Yang Yan had explored Zangxiong Valley together, and the Undying Five Elements Sword cultivation method, the Sun's True Essence, and the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade Platform had all been taken out from Zangxiong Valley.

At that time he had even run into several powerful corpse generals besieging them — if not for relying on Spatial Force, they likely would have had no chance to escape.

From the moment he had crossed blows with Fang Fengqi, Yang Kai had already begun to suspect something—and Qian Tong’s question only confirmed his guess.

“Old fool, your eyesight is fine; I do indeed come from Zangxiong Valley. I am of the noble Corpse Spirit Race, above all things!” Fang Fengqi shouted arrogantly without much fear.

The Corpse Spirit Race — that was how those special beings of the Corpse Spirit Sect referred to themselves, and Qian Tong had already heard of them from Fei Zhi Tu.

“And you think you can be above all things?” Qian Tong said coldly. “You are nothing more than people who should have died; you do not have that qualification.”

“Heh heh.” Fang Fengqi chuckled lowly. “Whether we have that qualification is not for you to decide — you will know in time! Old fool, don't waste your efforts; there is nothing I will tell you.”

“Oh?” Qian Tong let out a cold laugh. “Even if this old man were to destroy your Corpse Bead, you still wouldn’t cooperate?”

A corpse pearl is the bead suffused with Corpse Qi hidden in the abdomen of Corpse Spirit Race members like Fang Fengqi. For members of the Corpse Spirit Race that pearl is no less important than an Inner Core is to a demonic beast; all of the Corpse Spirit Race's abilities originate from their corpse pearl.

Fei Zhi Tu had once fought members of the Corpse Spirit Race and naturally knew these facts.

Fang Fengqi's face changed slightly and he roared: “Old fool, you dare threaten me!”

“Whether it’s a threat or not—you’ll know,” Qian Tong said, his tone pressing and forceful.

Fang Fengqi seemed to sense Qian Tong's resoluteness; his face turned cold and contorted, and he shouted, “If you think you can pry information from me, old fool, you are deluded. I will never let you have your wish.”

As he spoke, a terrifying fluctuation of energy suddenly welled up from his abdomen; a faint cracking sound rang out, as if something inside had split.

“Not good!” Fei Zhi Tu's face changed dramatically.

Everyone else quickly realized what was happening. Yang Kai immediately activated Saint Yuan, shielding Su Yan and Xia Ningshang at his side. Qian Tong waved his hand; thick Saint Yuan wrapped Wei Guchang and Xuan'er.

“One day the Corpse Spirit Sect will unify Dark Star — you will all die, ha ha ha!” Fang Fengqi laughed manically. With a heavy thud his entire body suddenly exploded.

A dense jade-green Corpse Qi burst from his center and surged outward. Wherever the Corpse Qi passed the ground corroded, tables and chairs disintegrated into powder, and the entire city lord's mansion shook as if it might collapse.

If not for Qian Tong holding the place with his Void King Realm cultivation at the last moment, the mansion would have suffered tremendous damage.

After all, that was a self-destruction by a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert — its power was unfathomable.

They had kept Fang Fengqi alive intending to probe the Corpse Spirit Sect, but instead gained nothing and invited trouble; Qian Tong's face was ugly.

If every one of the Corpse Spirit Sect's people was this recklessly suicidal, that would be a serious problem.

Outside the main hall, an Origin Returning Realm martial rushed in hurriedly, looked around in astonishment, and seemed unaware of what had happened.

“What is the matter?” Qian Tong asked in a low tone.

The man hurriedly cupped his fists and reported: “Report to Great Elder — the Corpse Spirit Sect disciples hidden within Tianyun City have all been eliminated!”

“Well done! Any casualties?”

“With the assistance of the Lingxiao Sect elders, only a dozen or so were killed or wounded!”

“Give them honorable burials!”

“Yes!”

Inside Yingyue Hall, although many had surrendered to the Corpse Spirit Sect out of fear, quite a few had held fast to their stance. Those people had all been imprisoned, and two days ago they had been rescued and were now serving Qian Tong.

Moreover, Fang Fengqi wasn’t the only one of the Corpse Spirit Race within Tianyun City. Earlier, when Yang Kai, Wei Guchang, and the others had stormed the City Lord’s Mansion, they had encountered several members of the Corpse Spirit Race there—and slaughtered them all.

Many had been hiding throughout Tianyun City, and now they were being unearthed one by one.

One could say that only now was Tianyun City truly renewed; its internal troubles had been entirely removed.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others strode in from outside.

“Thank you all for your efforts!” Qian Tong rose at once, cupping his fists in gratitude.

Yang Xiuzhu waved his hand and showed no sign of relaxation. “It was only killing some small fry, nothing strenuous, but if a single Tianyun City is like this, I truly wonder what the other cities on Dark Star are like.”

Fei Zhi Tu sighed: “Over the past two years the Corpse Spirit Sect has advanced extremely rapidly. They seem to have a secret art that can turn the living into Corpse Spirits, making them even more fanatically loyal. When the Corpse Spirit Sect first appeared two years ago they numbered only one thousand, but now it is more than tens of thousands; among these tens of thousands many are Origin Returning Realm experts from the great sects and clans — not to be underestimated!”

Fang Fengqi had previously planned to turn Fei Zhi Tu into a Corpse Spirit, which was why he had not destroyed Fei Zhi Tu's cultivation or meridians.

So long as the meridians were not destroyed, even if Fei Zhi Tu were beheaded, Fang Fengqi would still have a way to turn him into one of the Corpse Spirits, allowing him to wield the same strength he possessed in life.

“The Great Calamity of Dark Star!” Qian Tong let out a heavy sigh. After being away for seven or eight years, to return and find his homeland in such a state—the joy of advancing to the Void King Realm was instantly replaced by deep sorrow and concern.

“Everyone, I intend to return to Qiantian Sect to take a look,” Mo Yu suddenly said from the side.

He had spent the past two days helping in Tianyun City and had only now found a moment of free time.

“Brother Mo…” Qian Tong began, naturally concerned for him.

They had no idea what had happened to Qiantian Sect, but now at least half the forces on Dark Star had been drawn into this turmoil. Qiantian Sect was one of the major powers on Dark Star and a key target of the Corpse Spirit Sect, so the situation there was likely not optimistic.

It was only natural that Mo Yu wanted to return to Qiantian Sect — after all, he was a Great Elder there.

But letting him go alone at this time made people uneasy.

If possible Qian Tong would accompany him, but although Tianyun City had been retaken, Yingyue Hall's main hall problems had not yet been resolved.

The main hall was still mired in turmoil and urgently required his personal attention to rescue disciples who refused to submit and to slay the traitors who clung to life.

“I am no longer an ordinary Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; do not worry, I will be careful,” Mo Yu smiled faintly.

Seeing that his intent was firm, Qian Tong could not say more and only warned in a low voice, “Then Brother Mo, be careful on your journey.”

“Rest assured — now on Dark Star, few can stop me,” Mo Yu nodded.

In the past Mo Yu had been one of Dark Star's top Origin Returning Realm experts. After tempering in the Blood Prison, although he had not leapt to the Void King Realm like Qian Tong, his overall combat power had risen considerably.

No matter how powerful the Corpse Spirit Sect might be, without a Void King Realm master overseeing them, they likely wouldn’t be able to do anything to him.

“Senior Mo, how about waiting one more day? I’ll go with you,” Yang Kai suddenly said.

“Yang Kai, you want to return to Lingxiao Sect?” Qian Tong asked.

“Mm. Though the Lingxiao Sect is as solid as an iron fortress and I’m not worried about it being breached, I’m unsure of Elder Ye’s condition and can’t help but be concerned. I want to go back and take a look—and it happens to be on the same route as Senior Mo’s.”

“That will do!”

Though he did not know why Yang Kai wanted to wait a day, Mo Yu still agreed.

Once everything was settled, Yang Kai immediately made his way to where Tianyun City's Space Array was located.

When the Corpse Spirit Sect had taken control of Tianyun City, they had already destroyed the Space Array. Yang Kai wanted to see if he could manage to repair it.

If he could, it would save some travel time.

After all, the journey to Lingxiao Sect was not a short one!

Yang Kai had used Tianyun City's Space Array more than once and naturally knew its location. Soon he arrived with Su Yan and Xia Ningshang; the two women spread out to keep watch while Yang Kai carefully examined the Space Array.

Being adept at Spatial Arts did not mean one could set up a Space Array — that required vast formation knowledge. Yang Kai had never arranged one before, but he had seen Yang Yan set one up, so he had a measure of confidence.

He focused and observed for two hours, repeatedly sending Divine Sense to probe the internal structure of the destroyed Space Array and deducing the complex circuits.

After two hours Yang Kai's expression grew slightly pleased.

Fortunately, although the Space Array had been destroyed, the damage was not too severe; many of the patterns and structures were still discernible, and if he copied them he had some confidence he could restore it.

After carefully sorting out his thoughts, Yang Kai leapt onto the Space Array.

He took various rare minerals from his Spatial Ring, used Divine Sense Fire to smelt them, and patched the parts of the Space Array that had been destroyed.

Being his first time arranging one, he was inevitably clumsy; several times he nearly failed, leaving him quite frustrated.

But as time passed he became increasingly proficient.

Moreover, arranging the Space Array seemed to resonate with his mastery of Spatial Force, deepening his comprehension of spatial power considerably.

This unexpected gain greatly delighted Yang Kai.

It seemed that in the future there would be another method for cultivating Spatial Force.

Spatial Force had always been difficult to cultivate. At first Yang Kai trained it by drawing energy from Ethereal Crystals, but those crystals had long since been exhausted. Now Yang Kai cultivated Spatial Force mainly by opening the space of the Xuan Realm Pearl.

Setting up a Space Array was undoubtedly another entirely new method.
