## Chapter 169 — Surviving the Catastrophe

Outside, Zhang Ding listened to the lady's words, unmoved. He chuckled lightly and said, “Madam, please step down from the carriage first.”

“Are you truly so heartless?” The lady's face turned ashen. Zhang Ding's refusal to grant her request clearly indicated his intent to eliminate all threats.

“Madam.” Zhang Ding's voice turned cold, “If you cooperate obediently, I can leave you with a complete corpse. But if you refuse… Hehe, I must admit, I have admired you for a long time. It’s a pity I could not enjoy your beauty in the past, but before you die, I believe I can fulfill this wish!”

Inside the carriage, the lady trembled, her fists clenched tightly, knuckles turning white.

She could imagine what her fate would be if Zhang Ding truly intended to commit a crime against her.

“Heartless scoundrel!” Cui’er could not help but curse.

Zhang Ding sneered, “Cui’er, I hope you can still curse when someone strips you bare later.”

Among the few remaining martial artists, one laughed wildly, saying, “Cui’er, don’t worry, brother will take care of you later.”

Cui’er’s complexion turned pale as she shrank behind Yang Kai.

Inside the carriage, the three women were trembling uncontrollably, causing the carriage to sway.

“Madam, I will give you ten breaths of time to step down. I will grant you a quick death and ensure you are buried properly,” Zhang Ding issued his ultimatum.

The lady closed her eyes, tears streaming down her cheeks as she held her daughter’s hand tightly, their faces filled with despair.

After a moment, she made up her mind, opened her eyes, and gave her daughter a sorrowful smile, her gaze filled with determination.

Rather than be humiliated, it would be better to end it swiftly.

Just as she was about to rise, Yang Kai pressed her back down, shaking his head slowly at her.

Ten breaths of time quickly passed.

Zhang Ding’s impatient voice rang out, “It seems the madam is willing to give me this opportunity. In that case, I shall not be polite!”

With that, Zhang Ding reached out to lift the carriage curtain and stepped inside.

However, before his foot could land, a filthy black face with a wide grin and two rows of white fangs appeared before him.

A little beggar! This face was unmistakably that of the little beggar he had brought in a few days ago.

Zhang Ding was taken aback, his heart racing. He had focused entirely on the lady and had not noticed the presence of others in the carriage. After the shock came fury. How could a True Yuan Realm master like him be startled by a beggar? It was truly a loss of face.

Without thinking further, Zhang Ding reached out to grab Yang Kai, intending to throw him out.

Yang Kai did not dodge; instead, he swiftly struck out with seemingly weightless fists, landing four or five blows on Zhang Ding’s chest in the blink of an eye.

What incredible speed! Zhang Ding was once again astonished, but he quickly sneered, “Seeking death!”

He felt no strong destructive force from the little beggar's punches, assuming the other was merely flailing. He grabbed Yang Kai and threw him out, shouting angrily, “Kill him!”

Zhang Ding’s subordinates sprang into action, their blades and swords flashing as they charged toward Yang Kai.

“Little beggar!” Cui’er exclaimed in shock, never expecting the calm Yang Kai to be just a façade. In a single encounter, he had been dealt with by Zhang Ding.

Before her words could finish, Zhang Ding’s expression suddenly changed, half of his body frozen in place as his face turned red, his eyes bulging out in horror.

In the next moment, with a loud explosion, a spray of blood erupted from Zhang Ding's chest, and a violent surge of scorching primordial energy surged within him.

Zhang Ding was terrified, his soul shaken, realizing that the little beggar’s punches were far from ordinary.

He hurriedly circulated his True Yuan to suppress the turmoil in his chest.

Bang bang bang… A series of sounds erupted. Zhang Ding’s entire chest became a bloody mess, and he let out a scream as he stumbled out of the carriage.

As expected of a True Yuan Realm master. The robust defense of his True Yuan was not something an ordinary person could compare to. Yang Kai’s four or five Flame Yang Explosions struck him in quick succession, and although they severely injured him, they did not claim his life.

Blood and flesh sprayed onto the three women as Zhang Ding stumbled back, causing them to scream in terror.

At the same time, Zhang Ding’s subordinates attacked Yang Kai, but they only saw his figure flicker and suddenly vanish, their attacks all missing.

The footwork he had comprehended over the past month finally proved useful at a critical moment.

The Earth Demon wrapped around the Soul-Breaking Spike, cackling eerily as it transformed into a cloud of black mist, disturbing the minds of the martial artists and causing chaos around them.

“What the hell is this?” One person’s face changed dramatically. Just as he shouted, Yang Kai appeared behind him, launching a fierce punch that struck his back.

This person’s strength was not high, and the hidden force of the Flame Yang Explosion surged into his body, causing his complexion to flush red instantly.

Taking advantage of the moment, the Earth Demon, along with the Soul-Breaking Spike, drilled into his body. When it emerged again, the man’s body exploded with a loud bang, turning into a mist of blood.

The eerie laughter grew even more unsettling. The Earth Demon, being an ancient demon, though its spiritual power had greatly diminished, still contained a terrifying force within its laughter.

With Yang Kai’s cooperation, they were nearly unstoppable.

Before Yang Kai could finish his footwork, all of Zhang Ding’s subordinates had been eliminated, their bodies reduced to bloody remnants.

At that moment, Zhang Ding finally managed to suppress the True Yang energy from Yang Kai, his expression twisted with madness as he stared at Yang Kai, incredulously shouting, “Little beggar, so you were pretending to be a pig to eat the tiger all along!”

The beggar he had thought was merely an ordinary person had now become the greatest obstacle to his plans. How could Zhang Ding remain calm? Moreover, he had just suffered a heavy loss at Yang Kai’s hands, his eyes bloodshot as he glared at Yang Kai with a murderous intent.

Yang Kai stood there, covered in blood, calmly looking at him, and asked, “How much combat power do you have left?”

If Zhang Ding were at his peak, Yang Kai estimated that unless he used the Mark of the Stars, he would not be his opponent. However, the Mark of the Stars required a long time to gather power, making it unsuitable for a life-and-death battle in the blink of an eye.

But at this moment, Zhang Ding was not at his peak. After battling Old Wu, he had sustained significant injuries, and now he had been ambushed by Yang Kai, leaving his chest a bloody mess. It was uncertain how much strength he had left.

Yang Kai was not afraid of him!

“Even if I only have twenty percent left, it’s enough to kill you!” Zhang Ding roared, his long sword shimmering as he unleashed his movement technique, closing in on Yang Kai, slashing out several times, determined to slay Yang Kai.

Before he could fully execute his sword technique, the Earth Demon, wrapped around the Soul-Breaking Spike, engaged him. The eerie laughter echoed continuously, and under the heavy injuries, Zhang Ding found it impossible to break through the Earth Demon’s blockade. He could not help but scream, “What kind of treasure is this!”

He was considered an experienced fighter with considerable knowledge, but he had never seen a treasure as bizarre as the Soul-Breaking Spike. It attacked and defended on its own, and the chilling laughter emanating from within was enough to instill fear.

Truly sinister!

“A treasure that will take your life!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly came from behind him. Zhang Ding’s hair stood on end. He clearly saw Yang Kai standing not far away, yet in the blink of an eye, he was suddenly behind him!

When he looked again, the little beggar in front of him had become a blur, merely an afterimage.

In a panic, he drew his sword and stabbed backward, but it struck nothing.

Yang Kai had already used his footwork to flash to his left side, and without hesitation, he threw a punch. Zhang Ding was caught off guard, letting out a scream as his arm exploded with a cracking sound, instantly hanging limply.

This punch shattered his shoulder blade.

Moreover, the primordial energy that invaded his body was exceptionally pure, far beyond what a Qi Movement Realm martial artist could possess. This particularly shocked Zhang Ding.

Although he had only practiced the Dual Cultivation Technique with Su Yan a few times, the technique significantly enhanced the purity of his primordial energy. The purity of Yang Kai’s primordial energy far exceeded his current realm, all thanks to the effects of the Dual Cultivation Technique.

Taking advantage of this moment, the Earth Demon pressed forward, and the Soul-Breaking Spike clashed with his long sword, producing a series of clanging sounds.

Master and servant, their swords combined perfectly, leaving Zhang Ding with no room to maneuver. In less than half a cup of tea’s time, he staggered, blood covering his body.

His mind shaken, Zhang Ding no longer had the will to fight. If he didn’t flee now, he felt he would die here. But Yang Kai and the Earth Demon would not give him the chance to escape, blocking his path completely.

With another Flame Yang Explosion unleashed, Zhang Ding spat out a mouthful of blood, his spirit dissipating. The Earth Demon seized the opportunity, wrapping around the Soul-Breaking Spike and charging into his body.

Zhang Ding’s expression instantly became dazed, his eyes gradually losing their light, before he collapsed to the ground.

Moments later, the Earth Demon reappeared, accompanied by maniacal laughter and chewing sounds, transforming into black mist that vanished at Yang Kai’s fingertips.

In this battle, the Earth Demon had devoured several souls, greatly replenishing itself!

Standing in place, panting heavily, Yang Kai felt a wave of weakness wash over him.

This time, he did not activate the Unyielding Will, as the battle with Zhang Ding had not posed any real pressure or crisis for him.

However, Yang Kai could sense that his strength was still too low!

If not for Zhang Ding being injured, if not for his successful ambush, and if not for the Yang Liquid stored in his Dantian, how could he possibly face such a master in direct combat?

Just the use of Flame Yang Explosion alone required three moves to drain all the primordial energy in his meridians. Any Qi Movement Realm martial artist in this situation would likely have become a corpse.

And yet, he had unleashed nearly ten Flame Yang Explosions on Zhang Ding before he and the Earth Demon managed to kill him. The hardships he faced were not something to be shared with outsiders.

After calming down for quite a while, Yang Kai slowly walked toward the third carriage.

As he approached, the three women inside clearly tensed up, Cui’er’s trembling voice calling out, “Little beggar…?”

“En.” Yang Kai replied weakly.

The carriage curtain was lifted, revealing Cui’er’s pale, panicked face. Behind her, the lady and the young miss looked at Yang Kai with anxiety.

“What about them?” Cui’er glanced around.

“Dead.”

Cui’er immediately covered her mouth in disbelief, staring at Yang Kai, while the lady and the young miss both let out a sigh of relief.

They had thought they would not escape this calamity, but unexpectedly found themselves alive against all odds. The stark contrast of surviving death left them feeling almost drained.

Once they relaxed, the three women felt their bodies grow weak.

“Stay put, I’ll check if there are any survivors.” Yang Kai instructed before turning to investigate near the campfire.
