## Chapter 9 — Shopkeeper Meng

Throughout the entire Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai was familiar with only one person — Shopkeeper Meng before him. After all, he came here once every month.

Shopkeeper Meng had a nickname: Skin-Peeler Meng. Although he was merely a minor shopkeeper in the Contribution Hall within Lingxiao Pavilion, he took great pleasure in squeezing contributions from the disciples.

Originally, the Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment, priced at ten contribution points per bottle, was sold by him at the price of three bottles for two. His method was simple—he would put the amount of two bottles into three bottles, selling them off at a premium. Take it or leave it; if you don’t buy, get lost!

Of course, Shopkeeper Meng did not always engage in such unscrupulous acts, only occasionally. Moreover, he only targeted wealthy disciples—he had no interest in poor wretches like Yang Kai.

Every disciple’s contribution points in Lingxiao Pavilion were hard-earned; how could they tolerate such exploitation? Thus, nearly every disciple he had swindled reported him to the Elders’ Assembly. Shopkeeper Meng was repeatedly warned but remained stubbornly defiant. Yet, his position as shopkeeper was unshakable, with no one able to replace him.

Because of this, Shopkeeper Meng was hated so fiercely by countless disciples that they ground their teeth at the mere mention of him.

The old man was blunt with everyone, but had no way to deal with Yang Kai. Once, when he was eagerly staring at a female disciple’s behind, he was caught red-handed by Yang Kai.

Such disrespect for one’s elders! Having been caught in the act, Shopkeeper Meng felt completely humbled before Yang Kai.

It was precisely because of this that Yang Kai had become well acquainted with the old man.

The old lecher was thick-skinned and quickly regained his composure. He gave Yang Kai a sidelong glance and said, “Same as usual?”

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded obediently.

Shopkeeper Meng said nothing, but reached under the counter and tossed ten taels of silver in front of Yang Kai, then took out his ledger and made a note.

Yang Kai pocketed the silver and asked, “How many contribution points do I have now?”

Shopkeeper Meng rolled his eyes. “You save four points per month, spend one point monthly to exchange for ten taels of silver, leaving you three points. So far, you’ve only managed to accumulate a mere twelve contribution points. What, want to buy a bottle of Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment?”

“No, just asking,” Yang Kai waved his hand and murmured, “Only twelve points, huh.”

Such a small amount of contribution points wasn’t even enough to exchange for a valuable herb.

Shopkeeper Meng’s expression grew serious, and he lowered his voice. “Little Yang Kai, I know you want that Marrow Cleansing Pill to improve your aptitude, but if you keep saving like this, who knows when you’ll ever get enough?”

“You’ll eventually save enough, won’t you?” Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

Shopkeeper Meng was left speechless. At this rate, he thought, by the time Yang Kai saved enough, he’d have been dead a hundred years.

“But Shopkeeper Meng, I’m curious about something,” Yang Kai furrowed his brow.

“Speak!” The old man struck a tone as if he were feeling generous today.

“The Marrow Cleansing Pill is such a precious pill. How does it appear in the Contribution Hall? And how come no one else has exchanged for it yet?”

“Heh heh...” Shopkeeper Meng smirked with pride. “Because this pill is my own treasure; no one else knows about it.”

“Oh, it’s your own?” Yang Kai was stunned. He had always assumed the Marrow Cleansing Pill belonged to Lingxiao Pavilion. No wonder the old man offered it to him at an exorbitant price.

“Don’t be angry.” Shopkeeper Meng took a sip from the teapot on the counter with satisfaction. “Though it’s mine, I won’t be giving it to you cheap. If you want it, come with enough contributions to exchange for it. The name ‘Skin-Peeler Meng’ didn’t come from nowhere.”

“I’ll save enough.” Yang Kai nodded.

Suddenly, Shopkeeper Meng’s face changed, and he winked at Yang Kai, whispering, “I heard you got beaten up again yesterday?”

Yang Kai glared at him and turned to leave.

Shopkeeper Meng called after him, “Come, talk to me first. Don’t rush off.”

There was nothing to say; the old man was clearly taking delight in Yang Kai’s misfortune.

Before Yang Kai left the Contribution Hall, the old man’s expression grew solemn. Fixing his gaze on Yang Kai’s retreating figure, he said in a low voice, “Little Yang Kai, just go back where you came from. Lingxiao Pavilion is not a place for you. You’ll end up beaten to death sooner or later.”

Yang Kai paused but did not turn back. He sighed softly: “I have nowhere to go.”

With that, he left the Contribution Hall.

Shopkeeper Meng held his teapot with both hands and sighed deeply. “Why bother?”

The Marrow Cleansing Pill… heh heh, such a heaven-defying treasure I certainly don’t have. I just made up a lie to give you hope, but you actually believed it.

Yang Kai first returned to his small room and put down the broom before hurrying out of Lingxiao Pavilion.

He planned to go to Wumei Town, ten li outside Lingxiao Pavilion. Today, having exchanged a little contribution for ten taels of silver, he naturally needed to purchase some food — a monthly routine for him.

Along the way, Yang Kai felt no fatigue for the first time.

Previously, every trip to Wumei Town saw him red-faced and panting after just ten li, but today there was no such feeling. His body was only slightly warm but filled with energy. Yang Kai was confident that even if he walked a hundred li, he would not feel tired.

Was this the work of the Golden Body? Yang Kai suddenly recalled an incident from the morning. A junior brother had accidentally bumped into him while he was sweeping, yet Yang Kai remained steady while the stronger junior brother was knocked to the ground.

At that time, he had given it little thought, but now reflecting on it, it was inconceivable. With his frail frame, when had he ever been the one to make others fall? It was always him who got sent flying.

The more he thought about it, the more excited he became. The Golden Body had brought him substantial changes. These effects were not apparent yet, but only with growth would he gradually uncover the Golden Body’s true power.

Lost in thought, he did not realize he had arrived in Wumei Town.

Looking around, he followed the street on his left. Yang Kai intended to visit a rice shop. The store wasn’t large; the owner’s surname was He, a local resident running a small and honest business, trustworthy to all customers. This was why Yang Kai always dealt with him.

Such small shops were numerous in Wumei Town, a bustling place. Around this town, within a hundred li radius, besides Lingxiao Pavilion, there were Fengyu Tower and the Blood Battle Gang — two fairly reputable sects. Countless other minor sects and gangs existed, but these smaller groups were just ragtag bands of soldiers and brigands, unlike the three major sects like Lingxiao Pavilion that had their own territories.

It was this land that nurtured so many martial artists, making Wumei Town lively and prosperous, though it could not compare to places like Zhongdu.

Zhongdu was the capital of the Great Han Dynasty!

As Yang Kai walked, his eyes casually swept to a nearby alley, where a few men gathered. They looked shifty and appeared to be plotting something. One was very alert; upon noticing Yang Kai’s gaze, he glared fiercely with a sinister glare.

Yang Kai laughed lightly. Following the principle of not provoking unless provoked, he paid them no mind. What puzzled him was that one of these men looked familiar — apparently a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion.
