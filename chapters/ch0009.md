## Chapter 9 — Shopkeeper Meng

Throughout Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai was only familiar with one person — the shopkeeper Meng standing before him. After all, he came here once every month.

Shopkeeper Meng had a nickname: Meng Bapi, or "Skin-Peeler Meng." Though merely a small-time shopkeeper of the Contribution Hall within Lingxiao Pavilion, his greatest pleasure was squeezing contribution points from the disciples.

A bottle of Coagulation & Bruise-Dispelling Ointment, normally priced at ten Contribution Points, he would sell two bottles for the price of three. His method was simple: pour the quantity of two bottles into three, take it or leave it — and if you don’t buy, then get lost!

Of course, Meng did not always engage in such unscrupulous practices, only occasionally. Moreover, his targets were the wealthier disciples. Poor fellows like Yang Kai were beneath his notice.

Every disciple in Lingxiao Pavilion earned their contribution points through hard effort. How could they tolerate such exploitation? So almost every disciple he had cheated reported him to the Elders’ Council. Meng had received repeated warnings, but he remained obstinate and indifferent. Yet his position was unshakable, with no one able to replace him.

Because of this, Meng was hated and reviled by countless disciples, their teeth clenched in fury.

Meng showed no courtesy to anyone, yet against Yang Kai, he was helpless. Once, while Meng was leering at a female disciple’s backside with great interest, Yang Kai had caught him red-handed.

Such disrespect for an elder! Being caught with his pants down, Meng felt small before Yang Kai.

This was the reason Yang Kai and Meng were acquainted.

Meng was lustful and shameless but quickly composed himself and squinted at Yang Kai, asking, “The usual?”

Yang Kai nodded obediently.

Without another word, Meng pulled out ten taels of silver from the counter and tossed them to Yang Kai, then took out his ledger to record the transaction.

Yang Kai pocketed the silver and asked, “How much contribution do I have now?”

Meng rolled his eyes. “You save four Contribution Points monthly but spend one to exchange for ten taels of silver, so you have three left. So far, you’ve only accumulated a mere twelve Contribution Points. What, you want to buy another bottle of ointment?”

“No, just asking,” Yang Kai shook his head, murmuring, “Only twelve points.”

Such a small amount was not even enough to exchange for a valuable herb.

Meng’s expression grew serious. Lowering his voice, he said, “Little Yang Kai, I know you want the Marrow Cleansing Pill to improve your aptitude, but at this rate, how long will it take you to save enough?”

“You’ll save it eventually, won’t you?” Yang Kai smiled lightly.

Meng had no reply. He thought, at your pace, I’ll be dead a hundred years before you accumulate enough.

“But Shopkeeper Meng, there’s something I don’t understand.” Yang Kai furrowed his brows.

“Speak!” The old man adopted an expression of good humor, as if it were Yang Kai’s lucky day.

“The Marrow Cleansing Pill is such a precious medicine, how did it come to be in the Contribution Hall? And no one else has exchanged it yet?”

“Heh heh,” Meng smiled proudly. “Because that pill is my own treasure; no one else knows about it.”

“Oh, it’s your own?” Yang Kai was surprised. He always thought the pill belonged to Lingxiao Pavilion. No wonder the old man was charging a sky-high price.

“Don’t be mad,” Meng said with a smug look, sipping tea from the pot on the counter. “Although it’s mine, I won’t sell it cheap. If you want it, bring enough contribution points. The name 'Skin-Peeler Meng' didn’t come for nothing.”

“I’ll save enough,” Yang Kai nodded.

Meng’s expression suddenly changed, and he winked at Yang Kai, whispering, “I heard you got beaten again yesterday?”

Yang Kai glared and turned to leave.

Meng called after him, “Come talk to me, don’t leave so quickly.”

What was there to say? Old Meng was clearly gloating.

Before Yang Kai could leave the Contribution Hall, Meng’s expression suddenly grew serious. He stared at Yang Kai’s back and said gravely, “Little Yang Kai, go back where you came from. Lingxiao Pavilion isn’t a place for you. You’ll be beaten to death sooner or later.”

Yang Kai froze, but did not turn back. He sighed softly, “I have nowhere else to go.”

With that, he left the Contribution Hall.

Meng held his teapot in both hands, sighing deeply, “What a pity.”

The Marrow Cleansing Pill... Haha, such a defiant treasure. How could I have it? Just made up a lie to give you hope, didn’t expect you to take it seriously.

Yang Kai first returned to his small room, set down his broom, then hurried outside Lingxiao Pavilion.

He was going to Wumei Town, ten li away, to trade some contribution points for ten taels of silver to buy grain — something he did every month.

Along the way, Yang Kai felt something he never had before — no fatigue.

Every previous trip to Wumei Town left him breathless and dizzy after the ten-mile walk, but today he felt only a slight warmth in his body and strong endurance. He was confident he could walk a hundred li without exhaustion.

Was this the effect of the Golden Body? Yang Kai suddenly recalled an incident earlier that morning when a fellow disciple bumped into him while sweeping. Despite his frailty, Yang Kai stood firm while the other was knocked down.

At the time, he had thought little of it, but now it seemed incredible. When had this thin frame ever caused others to fall? It was always himself who was sent flying.

Growing more excited, Yang Kai realized the Golden Body’s power was no small thing. The true extent of its strength would only reveal itself as he matured.

Lost in thought, he reached Wumei Town and snapped back to reality.

Looking around, he turned left down a side street. He was heading for a rice shop run by a local named He — a small, honest family business, well regarded by the townsfolk. This was why Yang Kai always traded there.

Such small shops were common in Wumei Town, which was unusually prosperous and bustling because the surrounding hundred-mile area, besides Lingxiao Pavilion, was home to Fengyu Tower, Blood Battle Gang, and two other decent sects. Numerous smaller groups also existed, but unlike the big three sects, these scattered bands had no fixed territory.

The local environment nurtured many warriors, making Wumei Town lively and prosperous, though it still could not compare to Zhongdu — the capital of the Great Han Dynasty!

As Yang Kai walked, he casually glanced to the side and noticed a few people gathered suspiciously in an alley. One was especially alert and, catching Yang Kai’s gaze, glared fiercely at him.

Yang Kai smiled lightly, adhering to the principle of “if others don’t provoke me, I won’t provoke them.” He ignored them.

What puzzled him was that among these people, one looked familiar — seeming to be a disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion.
