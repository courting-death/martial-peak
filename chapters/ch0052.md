## Chapter 52 — A Worthwhile Investment

Gazing at his junior brother’s sour expression, Yang Kai chuckled, “Don’t be so nervous. I’m just here to earn a few Contribution Points. Rest assured, I’ll be gentle—guaranteed not to hurt you.”

Ten breaths later, the junior disciple lay sprawled on the ground as Yang Kai strode away without looking back.

Xia Ningshang stood atop a treetop, taking it all in. Her eyes narrowed into crescent shapes, a faint smile playing at her lips. Witnessing firsthand a junior brother who had suffered one hundred and forty-seven consecutive defeats slowly rise and grow stronger gave her an inexplicable sense of accomplishment. Though Yang Kai’s progress had nothing to do with her, over these two years she had grown accustomed to secretly observing him. It was a silent form of guardianship. As Yang Kai grew stronger, Xia Ningshang found herself inexplicably pleased.

Beside Dragon Confinement Ravine, Yang Kai continued his cultivation. Five days had passed since he planted the seed of the Three-Yang Fruit. The sapling had already grown to a zhang in height, changing noticeably every day. Now, the Three-Yang Fruit tree swayed gently in the breeze, three bright red blossoms in full bloom. It would be only a matter of days before the fruit appeared.

When that time came, Yang Kai would feast heartily.

His cultivation in recent days had also borne fruit. A droplet of Yang Liquid had condensed in his dantian, and his mastery of the True Yang Technique had deepened considerably.

The daily chore of sweeping the grounds had been taken over by someone else, granting Yang Kai much more time to cultivate.

In these days, Yang Kai also kept an ear out for any news from Fengyu Tower. After all, having killed Cheng Shaofeng and Nu Tao, trouble might still be brewing. Yet, to his relief, there was no unusual activity. It seemed Hu Mei’er had not betrayed him.

That woman was, surprisingly, trustworthy.

The eighth day of the new month arrived, finally time to settle Contribution Points.

On the eighth day of last month, Yang Kai had just acquired the Proud Bone Golden Body, standing at Body Tempering – Third Stage. Now, barely a month later, he had reached Body Tempering – Eighth Stage. Such speed of cultivation was unmatched across the world. Even those so-called prodigies, aided by miraculous pills, could not compare.

Entering the Contribution Hall, Shopkeeper Meng, seated behind the counter, narrowed his eyes in surprise as he looked at Yang Kai. He noticed that after several days of absence, Yang Kai’s strength had increased tremendously.

The surprise lasted only a moment before Shopkeeper Meng returned to his usual calm. He was no fool; in fact, his insight far surpassed anyone in Lingxiao Pavilion. Though Yang Kai’s growth was great, it was not enough to shock him. He had seen many youths who shone brightly in their youth, only to achieve nothing in the end.

“Shopkeeper Meng,” Yang Kai greeted.

“Here to exchange something?” the old man sized him up.

“Yes. I have fifty-nine Contribution Points this month, right?”

Sweeping earned ten points, and each victory over an opponent granted two points. Yang Kai had fought twenty-seven battles this month, though he was absent from the sect for three days. However, he had lost five points after being caught drinking with Su Mu by Shadow Hall disciples. The total came to fifty-nine points.

“Not bad. What would you like to exchange?”

“Twenty-nine Desolate Deadwood Herbs and thirty Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers.” The incense burner had not been used for some time due to a lack of materials. Though these items did not aid in cultivating Primordial Qi, they greatly benefited the tempering of the physical body.

Shopkeeper Meng gave him a meaningful glance before retreating to the back room to package the requested items.

Just as Yang Kai reached out to take them, Shopkeeper Meng pulled back his hand and smiled, asking, “Little Yang Kai, can you tell me what exactly you ate on Black Wind Mountain?”

He was still curious about Yang Kai’s strange encounter.

Yang Kai grinned and made up a story, “I don’t know either. It was just a bright red fruit. I ate it because I was hungry.”

“A bright red fruit… a bright red fruit…” Shopkeeper Meng pondered deeply but could not match it to any known spirit fruit.

After a moment, he shook his head. “Forget it. But aren’t you planning to save your Contribution Points for my Marrow Cleansing Pill?”

The old Yang Kai had been stingy, carefully calculating every point spent. Now, however, he was generous to the extreme, spending all his points as soon as they arrived. It was unlike him.

Yang Kai smiled, “No more exchanges. Only through my own effort can I grow stronger. Relying on a single pill was short-sighted of me before.”

Hearing this, Shopkeeper Meng studied him intently and nodded with a smile. “Very good. I didn’t expect you to see that so clearly. Little Yang Kai, let me give you some advice.”

“Please, Shopkeeper Meng.”

“Work hard and do not waste the fortune you have stumbled upon.”

“Your disciple takes this to heart!”

Leaving the Contribution Hall, Yang Kai hurried back to the side of Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Summoning the incense burner, he tossed the herbs inside and began to perform his martial arts by the ravine. The familiar pressure descended upon him—pressure far beyond what his current strength could bear. Soon, he was gasping for breath, utterly exhausted. Yet he refused to give up, persevering as each movement became increasingly difficult and obscure. His stamina drained like a floodgate opening, and his spirit grew dim and weary.

After a while, Yang Kai collapsed to the ground.

Struggling to sit up, he activated the True Yang Technique to restore his strength and spirit.

At first, Yang Kai had thought the incense burner had no effect on cultivating Primordial Qi. Now he realized his mistake. Under the influence of the strange fragrance, the Yang energy circulating through his meridians seemed shackled, moving extremely slowly, inch by inch, evoking a helpless feeling.

The exotic scent hindered the flow of True Yang Primordial Qi, greatly reducing his cultivation efficiency.

Yang Kai did not hastily put away the incense burner but decided to observe further. He sensed it was not merely for tempering the body; this object was extraordinary, beyond his current understanding.

With the incense burner’s aid, his body grew stronger day by day, but his progress in the True Yang Technique lagged behind. The absorption of Yang energy slowed considerably. After two or three days, his True Yang Primordial Qi had barely increased.

Was the incense burner truly just an obstacle to cultivating qi? After several days of testing, Yang Kai felt discouraged.

If so, the incense burner’s value would be greatly diminished.

Helpless, Yang Kai resolved to put away the incense burner during rest periods to prevent it from interfering with the flow of his Primordial Qi and unnecessarily prolonging recovery.

After another bout of exhaustion, he stored the incense burner inside the Wordless Black Book.

Activating the True Yang Technique, Yang Kai’s expression suddenly changed as he carefully sensed his body.

Moments later, a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. He discovered that the circulation speed of his True Yang Primordial Qi was faster than it had been in the previous two days.

The faster the qi circulates, the quicker the Yang energy is absorbed. In battle, this meant greater explosive power.

So that was it! The incense burner’s presence did not hinder his qi cultivation but, in some way, brought him immense benefit.

His body had adapted to the pressure of the exotic fragrance. Once the fragrance’s effect was removed, the qi naturally flowed faster than before. It was like a man used to carrying three thousand jin of stones suddenly switching to three hundred jin—his steps would be swift and light.

The same principle applied here.

Realizing this, Yang Kai laughed.

Though the incense burner might slow his True Yang Technique cultivation in the short term, in the long run, this minor hindrance would yield great gains. This was truly a worthwhile investment!
