## Chapter 114 — The Defeat of Wen Feichen

When masters clash, victory and defeat hinge on a single thought.

Long Hui’s death had clearly unsettled Wen Feichen’s state of mind, causing him to rush a move that revealed numerous flaws.

Xia Ningshang would never miss such a rare opportunity. Her beautiful eyes cold as frost, her palms crossed in a deadly strike.

Sensing danger, Wen Feichen struggled to defend, but could not fully block the attack. The burst of energy struck his chest, immediately wounding him.

Before he could regain composure to contend with Xia Ningshang, Yang Kai lifted Long Hui’s corpse before him and charged into their battle circle. Flames flickered over his fists as he stealthily struck a punch from beneath Long Hui’s armpit.

Xia Ningshang’s timely pressure on Wen Feichen left him caught between two assaults.

Caught in a pincer attack, Wen Feichen grew flustered and his expression turned desperate.

At his current strength, he could not harm Xia Ningshang, but if he launched a full assault, he could severely injure Yang Kai. Yet Yang Kai shamelessly used Long Hui’s corpse as a shield. No matter what tactics Wen Feichen employed, he could not act freely.

To harm Yang Kai, he would first have to destroy Long Hui’s body, but he hesitated.

“Despicable brat!” Wen Feichen’s fury blazed. Struggling to fend off both attackers, he cursed, “The dead are sacred, yet you treat Young Master Long’s corpse with such contempt. Are you not afraid of divine retribution?”

Yang Kai snorted coldly, “The ones who deserve punishment are you! If you had not pressed us so relentlessly, would things have come to this?”

Wen Feichen was speechless. Indeed, these two had only come to this valley seeking treasures. They had provoked no one. Yet his group had chased them over two or three thousand li, intent on killing them, relying on overwhelming numbers to bully the weak. Who was he to cast blame?

Amid the bickering, Yang Kai seized an opening. While Wen Feichen struggled against Xia Ningshang’s assault, Yang Kai’s punch landed squarely on his waist and abdomen.

Instantly, ten drops of Yang Liquid surged forth, transforming into sharp blades that pierced deep.

Wen Feichen grunted and staggered back, his eyes wide with shock and terror as he looked toward Yang Kai.

This young man’s attack was several times fiercer than the woman’s. The scorching Yang energy poured into his body, leaving a bloodied hole in his abdomen. Though not fatal, the injury was severe.

Yang Kai’s expression grew grave. He realized he had underestimated this True Yuan Realm expert. Even ten drops of Yang Liquid failed to pierce through his body.

The True Yuan within a True Yuan Realm cultivator indeed offered far greater defense than Yuan Qi.

“Junior Brother, be careful!” Xia Ningshang suddenly cried out.

At that moment, Yang Kai saw the murderous madness flickering in Wen Feichen’s eyes as he lunged straight at him.

Finally enraged beyond reason, was he prepared to strike regardless of consequences? A cold smile crept across Yang Kai’s lips.

He knew that by using Yang Liquid, he would become Wen Feichen’s primary target. Though his realm was lower than Xia Ningshang’s, his attacks were more lethal.

If he were Wen Feichen, he would make the same choice.

Everything was unfolding as expected.

Faced with Wen Feichen’s charge, Yang Kai did not retreat but closed in swiftly.

“Stop!” Xia Ningshang shouted desperately, but both were rapidly closing the distance, beyond her control.

“You insolent brat, courting death!” Wen Feichen’s voice was grim as he raised a palm and struck toward Yang Kai.

Drawing a deep breath, Yang Kai’s muscles tensed fiercely. His True Yang Yuan Qi surged to its limit, bones clashing sharply, hair standing on end, skin flushed crimson, his appearance wild and frenzied.

With a thunderous crash, Wen Feichen’s palm struck Long Hui’s corpse.

Like a watermelon smashed open, Long Hui’s body exploded into a pile of shattered flesh, fully exposing Yang Kai who had been hiding behind it.

Wen Feichen struck again, this time targeting the now unprotected Yang Kai.

Both men’s faces bore a meaningful smile in that instant.

Under Xia Ningshang’s horrified gaze, the palm landed squarely on Yang Kai’s chest.

It was clear to see Yang Kai’s chest cave inward sharply. Accompanied by crisp sounds of cracking bones, a mouthful of blood sprayed out, turning into a mist that unintentionally splattered Wen Feichen’s face.

Wen Feichen would not tolerate blood spattered on him. He shifted his body hastily to dodge.

But before his palm could withdraw from Yang Kai’s chest, he saw a tragic yet triumphant smile appear once more at Yang Kai’s lips.

With a sharp snap, Yang Kai gripped Wen Feichen’s wrist tightly, panting heavily, his eyes bloodshot. “You are doomed!”

Wen Feichen’s face changed drastically. He had never expected this youth’s vitality to be so tenacious, or that his Yuan Qi could provide such formidable defense. Though severely wounded by the palm strike, he had not died as anticipated.

Yet even so, anyone struck by such a blow should be powerless to resist. Why did he still have such strength? How could he hold on so firmly? Such willpower was extraordinary.

“Let go of me!” Wen Feichen raised his other palm to strike Yang Kai.

Xia Ningshang would not allow him the chance. Furious, her hair flying, she summoned the surrounding Yin energy within dozens of zhang, and suddenly a crystal-clear ice spike appeared before her, howling as it shot toward Wen Feichen.

Before Wen Feichen’s palm could retreat, the sharp ice spike pierced through it. A scream rang out as blood splattered.

Yang Kai suddenly let out a fierce, triumphant roar. His previously restless Yuan Qi surged wildly.

The wave of energy, which had stabilized at the peak of the Open Origin Realm, was shattered by his burning will to win and frenzied battle intent. At this moment, it broke through once more.

Qi Movement Realm!

Though not a true breakthrough, merely his aura radiated the power of the Qi Movement Realm.

Yet now, Yang Kai’s combat strength rivaled anyone present.

Wen Feichen felt as if plunged into an ice cellar. He tried with all his might to pull back his hand but failed utterly. Meanwhile, his other hand was pierced by Xia Ningshang’s attack, the searing pain fueling his growing panic.

With a crack, Yang Kai snapped one of Wen Feichen’s fingers.

The pain radiated through all ten fingers. Wen Feichen could not endure it and howled in agony.

Another crisp crack followed, his screams rising and falling in torment.

Yang Kai sneered, snapping finger after finger until all five were broken. Then he yanked Wen Feichen down and drove his knee into his arm, breaking it.

Xia Ningshang did not relent either, her concern for Yang Kai’s injuries unyielding as she unleashed relentless attacks upon Wen Feichen.
