## Chapter 342 — Arrogant and Domineering

Standing on the high platform and looking down, the corrupted fountain water covering the ground had already risen to a considerable height.

These waters were not actual liquid but appeared like water, thick and viscous, containing various evils and dangers.

The evil spirits flocked to these waters, constantly devouring the energy within. However, if a martial artist fell into it, there was no doubt they would meet a grim fate.

But now, Yang Kai, enveloped in black aura, was completely unaffected by the corrupted fountain water. He moved through it like a fish swimming freely, continuously darting around.

Wherever he passed, all the scattered evil spirit essences were absorbed into his body.

Occasionally, he encountered one or two blind evil spirits, yet they did not attack him. Those spirits seemed oblivious to his presence and turned a blind eye to him.

Everyone was left dumbstruck!

The old man on the high platform was no different; his eyes were wide with disbelief.

The boy’s current state was incredibly bizarre. The energy radiating from him was utterly different from before, filled with a cruel and sinister aura, as if he were a mad demon, the evilness of his presence sending shivers down their spines.

What shocked the old man even more was that Yang Kai was currently collecting the essence of the evil spirits below. The spirits had been slaughtering each other, resulting in countless essences. Just by passing through, the boy had collected dozens of them, making the spectators green with envy and jealousy.

Moreover, he directly absorbed the evil spirit essences into his body, seemingly unconcerned about the evils contained within that might harm him.

“Hehehe…” Yang Kai laughed coldly while joyfully moving through the corrupted fountain water to collect the essences, the sound echoing with a mix of surprise, pride, and an overwhelming excitement.

His body and mind were both filled with ecstasy, as if he were holding a naked beauty, indulging in delightful pleasures.

Within his Indomitable Golden Body, rhythmic pulsations were felt; the evil spirit essences he had absorbed brought immense joy to the Golden Body, which voraciously devoured the evil energy from the surrounding corrupted fountain water. It seemed these energies were precisely to its liking.

His body transformed into a giant vortex, sucking in all the evil around him.

Yang Kai felt not a trace of discomfort but rather an expression of delight.

He didn’t understand why this was happening, but since his Golden Body enjoyed such energy, there was no need to delve deeper; he would just continue to absorb it.

After a significant while, Yang Kai suddenly felt a sense of saturation.

It wasn’t that the Golden Body was saturated; it was like an endless pit, capable of absorbing infinite energy. Instead, it was his current realm that had reached its limit.

If he didn’t break through this bottleneck, the Golden Body would not absorb any further, lest it become a burden to Yang Kai.

Upon realizing this, Yang Kai could not help but feel a bit regretful.

This bout of reckless absorption not only greatly nourished his Golden Body but also allowed his Dantian to store nearly a hundred clusters of evil spirit essences. He hadn’t even had the time to refine them, so he had to temporarily put them in the Dantian.

He could no longer store more.

Especially concerning the special essence left by the Soul Evil Spirit, Yang Kai was particularly attentive, as this essence was undoubtedly quite different from the others.

He needed to refine it quickly so that he could absorb more essences and, by doing so, break through his current realm.

With this thought, Yang Kai’s heart ignited with fervor.

Turning around, he saw that the group on the high platform was still watching him with concern, especially the Hu sisters, whose beautiful eyes were filled with worry that they could not conceal.

A warmth surged in his heart, and Yang Kai leaped down from the high platform, waving at them, “Give me all the Purifying Spirit Flasks!”

“Hehe…” Shen Yi chuckled greedily, “I knew Brother Yang was a man of honor!”

Saying this, he hurriedly collected everyone’s Purifying Spirit Flasks and tossed them toward Yang Kai.

There were only five Purifying Spirit Flasks. Three were brought by the Baoqi Sect, and the people from Ghost King Valley had two. Since the Hu sisters were only refugees here, they naturally had no Purifying Spirit Flasks.

Each flask could hold twenty clusters of essence, and with five flasks, that amounted to a hundred clusters!

Such a vast number would make anyone's heart race.

Yang Kai returned to moving through the corrupted fountain water, carelessly wandering amongst countless evil spirits while continuously using the Purifying Spirit Flasks to gather the essences, filling one flask before switching to another.

In no time, all five flasks were full.

The old man and the people from Xiaoyao Sect eyed him eagerly, each filled with expressions of greed and envy.

While they were fighting for their lives up on the high platform, barely finding the time to collect essences, Yang Kai, in contrast, roamed freely in the waters, carelessly gathering one cluster after another, causing palpable jealousy.

Comparing the two, how could they not be envious?

The old man felt his regret run deep; his old face displayed a kaleidoscope of emotions, with all sorts of feelings churning within.

Had he known this boy possessed such great capabilities, he would not have torn his relationship with Yang Kai. Yet now, having witnessed his strangeness and strength, it was too late to feel remorse.

The move he made against Yang Kai earlier had completely extinguished any hope of befriending him.

Even if he couldn’t get Yang Kai to create a mysterious barrier for him, it would have been great to have him help gather some essences! Watching Yang Kai below effortlessly gather essences as if it was simpler than picking watermelons.

Truly, this was a lamentable stroke of fate; he had missed out on such a golden opportunity!

In an instant, the old man felt toothaches, liver pains, and stomach aches; he felt ill all over.

Yang Kai, holding five filled flasks, tossed them upward before leisurely hovering above the corrupted fountain water. He turned his head and cast a cold glance at the old man.

The old man’s heart skipped a beat, unsure of what Yang Kai’s gaze meant.

As he was lost in thought, he suddenly saw Yang Kai grinning at him. His crimson eyes bore a peculiar glint as he floated over with ease.

Everyone on the high platform felt a sense of impending danger, tensing up with anxiety. Dealing with the evil spirits was already straining; if Yang Kai took this opportunity to kick them when they were down, it would be dire.

This truly felt like all calamities were descending upon a beleaguered roof while a ship encountered headwinds.

Yu Qing internally blamed the old man for his earlier recklessness, while maintaining a distant smile towards Yang Kai. He said, “This friend, take it easy. Our Xiaoyao Sect has no grievances with you. Please think twice before you act!”

Seeing Yu Qing’s humble demeanor, the people from Ghost King Valley couldn’t help but feel a surge of secret delight. Looking at Yang Kai, he no longer seemed villainous to them; at this moment, his silhouette was remarkably magnificent and graceful.

Without uttering a word or making any moves, he was able to instill tremendous fear in his enemies.

“Being a man should be like this!” Shen Yi spoke admiringly, smacking his lips.

Leng Shan let out a soft grunt, rolling her eyes.

“My friend, let’s converse peacefully,” Yu Qing noticed Yang Kai remained silent, increasingly perplexed by his intentions. All he could do was force a smile.

The old man’s expression fluctuated between joy and anger. He maintained his silence while letting Yu Qing play the fool, attempting to discern Yang Kai’s intentions through him.

“I want something!” Just as Yu Qing was feeling restless, Yang Kai finally spoke.

Yu Qing was reassured and quickly responded, “What does my friend want? Just say it, as long as it’s something from our Xiaoyao Sect, I’ll present it right away!”

“Your Purifying Spirit Flasks!” Yang Kai grinned, the black aura around him accentuating the fierce look of his white fangs.

“Of course!” Yu Qing did not dare to be negligent, quickly retrieving the Purifying Spirit Flasks his fellow disciples had with them.

They only carried two Purifying Spirit Flasks, something Yang Kai was already aware of, and these contained a few clusters of evil spirit essences.

With a faint gesture, he stored them away. Turning to the old man, Yang Kai let out a chilling smirk, squinting his eyes slightly, ominously saying, “No need for me to say much, right?”

The old man snorted, his expression displeased.

He was a Fifth Stage expert from the Divine Roaming Realm, and although he was aware of Yang Kai’s enigma and strength, he wasn’t afraid of him. However, he still had four juniors to care for. Without certainty of taking Yang Kai down in one hit, the old man dare not act rashly.

Yang Kai was openly demanding items from him, especially in front of his juniors, making the old man feel somewhat embarrassed.

Despite his pride, the old man didn’t want to provoke Yang Kai further. After a snort, he suppressed his anger and said, “Give it to him!”

“But…” A young man beside the old man hesitated, clearly reluctant to comply so easily.

“I said give it to him!” The old man barked.

“Yes!” The young man glared resentfully at Yang Kai, gritted his teeth, and pulled out two Purifying Spirit Flasks from his robe, tossing them toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai reached out to catch them, looking coldly at him.

“I’ve taken note of you; you’d better be careful!” The young man, fueled by youthful bravado, warned Yang Kai with a cold smile, feeling secure with his elder’s backing.

Yang Kai’s expression hardened, a cold light flashing in his eyes.

Before he could take action, the old man unexpectedly slapped the young man on the back of the head.

Smack…

The sound was crisp and sharp, sending the young man spinning several times before he stabilized himself. One side of his face instantly swelled up.

“Can’t you keep your mouth shut?” The old man glared at him with a menacing look.

Damn, I don’t even want to provoke this strange kid again. If you keep talking and he gets angry and decides to act, none of you will escape alive.

The young man was clearly stunned by the slap, seemingly unable to comprehend why his master would strike him, dazedly clutching his cheek, humiliation and anger shining in his eyes, his face reddening and then turning pale, but he dared not utter a word, swallowing the bitter taste of blood.

“Are you satisfied, young friend?” The old man glanced at Yang Kai lightly.

“Hahahaha!” Yang Kai laughed wildly, utterly unrestrained, nodding repeatedly, “Satisfied!”

“Let’s disperse!” the old man said heavily. Yang Kai standing beside their high platform made the old man feel like a thorn in his side, constantly alert to whether he might suddenly strike while also dealing with the evil spirits, making it exceedingly burdensome.

“Not in a hurry!” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, his demeanor calm and collected.

The old man’s expression shifted slightly, becoming increasingly unpredictable.

Yang Kai waved the Purifying Spirit Flasks in his hand, leisurely starting to collect the floating evil spirit essences by the high platform.

These essences were left behind after the old man and the people from Xiaoyao Sect defeated evil spirits, and were numerous. They were rightfully their spoils, yet no one had time to collect them, allowing them to float idly.
