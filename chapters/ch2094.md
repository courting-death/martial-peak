## Chapter 2094 — Blood-Returning Origin Pill

"Of course I've studied it — so what?" the man surnamed Fu snapped, displeasure written on his face as he turned his gaze toward Hua Qingsi.

Among those present he had paid no heed to the others, even Duan Yuanshan, the lord of Fenglin City, but he felt a degree of apprehension toward Hua Qingsi, for their cultivation realms were nearly equal.

Her sudden question put him on guard.

"It seems you haven't studied it thoroughly, Sir," Hua Qingsi said with a pursed smile.

"What do you mean by that?" the man surnamed Fu cried, inexplicably feeling he must have overlooked something.

"If you had studied it thoroughly, Sir, you would know that once the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Array is formed our Origin Qi merges into one, indistinguishable among us. Put simply, the array draws on our shared Origin Qi to operate; if our Origin Qi runs out, the array will collapse."

"What exactly are you saying?" the man surnamed Fu frowned.

“Is something so simple still beyond your understanding?” Hua Qingsi shot the Fu-surnamed man a mocking look and said, “The grand formation does not draw an equal amount of Origin Qi from each of us. It maintains its own balance… mm, those with higher cultivation will have more Origin Qi drawn, those with lower cultivation will have less. The proportion of consumption is the same for everyone. I wonder if, with this explanation, you now grasp it?”

"What?" the man surnamed Fu's expression suddenly changed.

He hastily unleashed his Divine Sense and probed carefully, only to confirm Hua Qingsi’s words: the Origin Qi within him and Hua Qingsi was ebbing far faster than anyone else’s, with Duan Yuanshan a distant second. The remaining Dao Origin Realm cultivators were all roughly on par.

The discovery made his face instantly sullen; he was displeased.

Du Lishen and Zhuang Pan, prompted by Hua Qingsi, at last found a subtlety as well; the two exchanged glances and both saw the concealed delight in the other's eyes.

After all, if that were the case, the seven truly suffered and prospered together — it bound the weak and the strong together so that they were truly indistinguishable.

They would no longer need to worry about their own power drying up, while the man surnamed Fu would still remain at ease.

"This Lord will be dragged to death by you bastards!" the man surnamed Fu shouted, furious.

"Sir, don't forget the Heart-Demon Oath you just swore," Hua Qingsi added, pouring oil on the fire and making him even more agitated.

Anyone who'd been held back would hardly be in a pleasant mood.

In anger he glared viciously at Qin Chaoyang, as if to blame him.

"I thought you all understood how this array operates..." Qin Chaoyang muttered.

Hua Qingsi giggled. "Since you are from Fei Sheng Palace, you must be carrying the Blood-Returning Origin Pills famed throughout the Southern Territory — would you be willing to part with one for each of us?"

"You wench... you dare covet this Lord's Spiritual Pills?" the man surnamed Fu roared, his face contorting as he nearly spat an obscenity.

Zhuang Pan's eyes brightened at the mention of the Blood-Returning Origin Pill; he looked pleadingly at the man surnamed Fu.

Du Lishen too wore an expression of craving.

It seemed that the Blood-Returning Origin Pill would be highly useful in the current situation.

A cold glitter flashed in Hua Qingsi's eyes, but she quickly composed herself and smiled enticingly. "Sir, why be so stingy? Fei Sheng Palace's Blood-Returning Origin Pill has some side effects, but its effect is overwhelmingly powerful and its fame stretches across the Southern Territory. With your high cultivation and important post in Fei Sheng Palace, surely you would carry at least a few of these pills on you, would you not?"

"No!" the man surnamed Fu snapped, his face twitching as he refused outright.

Hua Qingsi couldn't help but click her tongue, expression full of disdain.

"What is the Blood-Returning Origin Pill?" Yang Kai quietly asked Qin Chaoyang.

"You haven't heard of it, Brother Yang?" Qin Chaoyang exclaimed, staring at Yang Kai in open disbelief, his face a portrait of astonishment.

Yang Kai felt embarrassed and slowly shook his head.

"The Blood-Returning Origin Pill is a unique product of Fei Sheng Palace and apparently requires extremely strict conditions at its refining site, so even Pillmasters from a powerhouse like Star God Palace cannot produce it. The pill's greatest effect is the rapid restoration of Origin Qi, and its power is tremendous, but..."

"But what?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"But upon taking the pill, it consumes a certain portion of one's own Essence-Blood, so there is a side effect. Yet its flaw is slight compared to its virtue; what is a bit of Essence-Blood against its effect? One such spiritual pill can save a life in a critical moment. Because the pill is produced in such small quantities, it is astonishingly expensive — a single pill is worth at least hundreds of thousands of Source Crystals!"

"You old dog, you know quite a lot!" the man surnamed Fu said with a proud smile. "Indeed, my Palace's Blood-Returning Origin Pill is unrivaled in the Southern Territory — even a great sect like Star God Palace cannot refine it, because it must be refined within my Palace's forbidden grounds. The supply can't even meet our own disciples; how would there be extras for the likes of you?"

"If you're not giving them, then don't—why make such a fuss?" Hua Qingsi snorted. "Anyway, once our Origin Qi is exhausted we'll all die here together; I won't be alone."

"Madam Hua, don't speak like that — we'll get through this," Zhuang Pan said, pale, trying to comfort himself.

"What does the Blood-Returning Origin Pill look like?" Yang Kai asked.

Qin Chaoyang said, "Blood-red in color, smells of blood, about the size of a broad bean..."

Yang Kai's expression turned odd as he produced a jade bottle from his Spatial Ring and said, "Could it be this?"

Everyone was startled and stared at him.

Yang Kai calmly opened the bottle and poured out a pill, and it matched Qin Chaoyang's description perfectly: blood-red, with a faint metallic tang, about the size of a broad bean.

"Blood-Returning Origin Pill!" the man surnamed Fu exclaimed, his gaze hardening as he glared at Yang Kai. "How do you possess such an item?"

"Ha ha — this truly is the Blood-Returning Origin Pill?" Yang Kai laughed, seeming somewhat surprised.

Qin Chaoyang's face went pale; he trembled as he signaled urgently for Yang Kai to put the pill away.

Duan Yuanshan and the others' faces shifted as well; they fell silent.

"Boy, this Lord is asking you a question — where did you get these spiritual pills?" the man surnamed Fu demanded, his tone low and cold.

"I picked them up," Yang Kai replied casually.

The others all reacted with dismay.

That bottle held at least a dozen pills, worth several million Source Crystals; how could such items be casually picked up?

It should be known that Blood-Returning Origin Pills rarely leaked outside — only important figures of Fei Sheng Palace would carry any — and Yang Kai suddenly possessing so many made people wonder whether he had done something terrible to some important person from Fei Sheng Palace, perhaps even murder.

That was why Qin Chaoyang had urgently signaled him earlier.

Indeed, some time ago an important figure from Fei Sheng Palace had come to Fenglin City: Ning Yuancheng, the Young Master of Fei Sheng Palace.

But since the auction a year prior, Ning Yuancheng had disappeared, and Fei Sheng Palace had appointed a new Young Master.

Those facts were not secret, and combined with the pills in Yang Kai's possession, many conclusions sprang to mind.

"Bullshit!" the man surnamed Fu barked, his aura turning dangerous as he glared at Yang Kai. "Kid, if you don't make this clear today, this Lord will make you regret being born into this world!"

Yang Kai laughed lightly, showing no fear, which shocked the others with his nerve. "I picked up a bottle of spiritual pills and you make such a show of it as if I murdered your parents. Even if these pills came from Fei Sheng Palace, there's no need to act like this, is there?"

Before the man surnamed Fu could speak, Yang Kai added, "But yes, I picked them up — and I also picked up a tower-ship secret treasure."

The man surnamed Fu was momentarily stunned, as if the thought of something occurred to him; he suppressed his anger and coldly said, "Describe in detail how you came by these items."

"What's there to say?" Yang Kai chuckled. "The two sides fought and ended up killing each other. I hid off to one side and watched it through, then went onto the battlefield and picked these things up."

Qin Chaoyang's eyes nearly popped out.

The proverb "when the snipe and the clam quarrel, the fisherman gains" is an old saying; in the world of martial cultivation such neat outcomes are rarely seen.

"At the time I was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm — that was a battle between Dao Origin Realm experts, so how could I have interfered?" Yang Kai explained.

"Indeed, Brother Yang only recently advanced to the Dao Origin Realm; a year ago he was at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm," Qin Chaoyang said, nodding.

The man surnamed Fu frowned slightly, showing some relief and no longer as enraged, though his tone remained harsh: "If it was a fight between two parties, then besides our Fei Sheng Palace people who else was present?"

"The other side had only one person — Han Leng!" Yang Kai replied.

"Han Leng?" everyone exclaimed, shocked.

Hua Qingsi's beautiful eyes flashed; she looked at Yang Kai with a complicated mixture of surprise and pleasure.

"So it was that Star God Palace's traitor!" the man surnamed Fu seemed to accept Yang Kai's account.

Du Lishen said thoughtfully, "So their grudge was formed at that auction?"

At the auction, nearly every Dao Origin Realm cultivator present had taken part; Ning Yuancheng and Han Leng had competed for the same item, and everyone had seen it. Now, hearing Yang Kai's account, they immediately guessed what had happened afterward.
