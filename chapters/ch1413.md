## Chapter 1413 — Bone-Eroding Parting Flame Lamp

Imperial Might shrouded the place; everyone struggled to breathe, their hands and feet gone icy cold.

In that moment and at that place, regardless of cultivation or age, every expert felt reduced to a three-year-old in the face of Imperial Might — a discovery that filled them with both astonishment and terror, finally making them realize just how exalted the Starry Sky Emperor truly was.

If mere Imperial Might carried such majesty, then if the Great Emperor still lived, a single thought from him might well shatter every body present into fragments.

That was absolutely a level beyond the Void King Realm!

Fortunately, the Imperial Might did not last long; after about the time of a single incense stick the invisible force gradually faded until it vanished completely. Labored breaths rose and fell, and every face was pale with lingering fright.

Before anyone could fully recover, another anomaly erupted!

A thunderous humming rang out from the direction of the Imperial Garden, deafening in its intensity.

"What now?" someone cried, brow creased in alarm — these repeated strange events had them on edge, fearing some ill change within the Imperial Garden.

Looking up, they saw a beam of light surge from where the Imperial Garden hovered, rushing downward as if slow yet urgent. The column was only as thick as an arm, but it seemed to contain power capable of destroying heaven and earth, impossible to stare at directly.

Yang Kai's face turned deathly ashen in an instant.

No wonder — the direction of that inscrutable beam was aimed straight at his Dragon Lair Mountain!

The Imperial Garden had always floated directly above Dragon Lair Mountain, and the beam fell straight down; Dragon Lair Mountain was taking the full blow. There was no avoiding it.

The Protective Mountain Array was formidable, its interior riddled with sealing formations, but Yang Kai had no confidence it could withstand that beam. In desperation he glanced at Yang Yan and saw her expression sour; he immediately knew matters were grave.

In a blink, the beam from the Imperial Garden struck the Protective Mountain Array surrounding Dragon Lair Mountain. This array had withstood thirty-plus Origin Returning Realm experts hammering it for two days and nights without falling, yet the light barrier dissolved like snow beneath a blazing sun.

Silently, the Protective Mountain Array was pierced; a hole opened, and the light curtain's color flashed wildly before instantaneously dimming.

The beam then struck somewhere on Dragon Lair Mountain and abruptly vanished. Faintly, a notable fluctuation of power emanated from that spot.

Countless gazes turned sharply toward the interior of Dragon Lair Mountain, faces showing varying emotions — alarm, doubt, puzzlement, greed, wariness...

Whatever that beam was, there was no doubt it had been fired from the Imperial Garden — they had seen it with their own eyes — and now that it had vanished it seemed to have left something behind.

Everyone wanted to know what it was!

Was it a great treasure, or perhaps an entrance into the Imperial Garden? Whatever it was, it made people's eyes burn with envy and their hearts long to take a look. The beam's appearance once more made Dragon Lair Mountain the center of attention.

At this moment the Protective Mountain Array had been breached; if not for a woman surnamed Ye standing there with phoenix-like eyes full of authority, the scene would have certainly descended into chaos. Her presence alone barely maintained a precarious balance.

How long her intimidation would hold no one could guarantee — this matter was weighty, and the lone woman surnamed Ye, however strong, could not stop everyone by herself.

The woman surnamed Ye seemed to sense the danger as well; an invisible force radiated from her delicate form. Though she looked slight, she stood with the aura of a single gatekeeper who could bar ten thousand.

Yang Kai's eye twitched; his mouth tasted bitter.

No one had foreseen the situation spiraling like this. For now there were two options: withdraw and let the strong forces enter Dragon Lair Mountain to satisfy their curiosity, or forcibly block them and claim whatever the beam left behind alone. There was simply no third path.

Blocking them was impossible — a lone tiger cannot stand against a pack of wolves. Relying only on Ye, how could she stop the onslaught of so many experts?

Yielding was not Yang Kai's style either. He was as curious as anyone about what the vanished beam had left behind!

Reading the room and seeing the covetous glint in the eyes of the powerful factions, Yang Kai knew he had to choose quickly; if he let them act first, he would lose the initiative.

With that in mind, Yang Kai moved his Divine Sense and transmitted to the Ye woman. She lifted a graceful brow in surprise, then imperceptibly nodded.

No sooner had their agreement formed than Mo Xiaosheng of the Battle Sky Alliance could not contain his curiosity. He stepped forward, face solemn, cupping his hands: "Senior Sister Ye..."

Before he finished, Ye's brows snapped up and she snapped, "Don't even think about it!"

At the same time Yang Kai's body blurred as he rapidly retreated; ripples of spatial energy shivered around him.

"Space force?" Mo Xiaosheng's eyes narrowed; he watched Yang Kai's vanishing form in stunned attention. As the Battle Sky Alliance's Great Elder, Mo was likewise versed in space techniques, so he was more sensitive to such fluctuations than anyone.

Seeing Yang Kai use space force to withdraw, Mo Xiaosheng instantly understood his intention. Astonished at Yang Kai's deft command of space, he roared, "Brat, how dare you!"

He feared Ye, but aside from her he dismissed everyone else at Dragon Lair Mountain. Yang Kai, a mere Saint King, dared to try to beat so many experts to the punch — how could Mo tolerate that?

As he spoke, Mo Xiaosheng also took a step forward, his figure blurring.

Like Yang Kai, he was using space force.

"Show yourself!" Ye cried, stretching out a slender hand to grasp at a spot in the void. The surrounding Spiritual Qi contracted, and a staggering figure fell out of the air — the Battle Sky Alliance's Great Elder, face full of terror.

He had not expected Ye's methods to be so formidable; even his trump card had been easily undone.

The fragile calm and balance were broken by Yang Kai and Mo Xiaosheng. The many experts who had been coveting Dragon Lair Mountain saw their opportunity and wasted no time; they activated their movement techinques and surged toward where the beam had struck.

"No one walks away!" Ye's form flickered with light as a secret treasure like an oil lamp materialized before her. She swept her hand across its wick and pinched a blue flame into existence on her fingertip, flicking it forward.

The blue fire stretched with the wind and in the next moment transformed into a giant bird over ten zhang in length, majestic and menacing. The bird opened its beak and spat out basin-sized balls of flame that swept like a storm toward the gathered experts.

"The Bone-Eroding Parting Flame Lamp!" someone who recognized it cried out in alarm, face drained as they hurriedly invoked their strongest defensive secret treasures.

At the cry of its name, others paled and retreated, unwilling to test its edge.

The lamp's reputation was terrifying — it was one of the few Void King-Grade secret treasures on Dark Star!

Treasures of that caliber could not be forged by Dark Star's current refineries; they were relics passed down from antiquity, their power incalculable. The bone-eroding flames emitted from this treasure could not be touched; once tainted by them, no matter the cultivation, death was inevitable. Though Ye stood alone, wielding that treasure made her alone nearly comparable to a Void King. Who would court death now?

In an instant many experts were routed, faces filled with panic as they scattered, the scene erupting into chaos.

Yet even Ye, formidable as she was, found dealing with so many attackers — including some equal to her realm — taxing; after the strike her face paled slightly.

At her level, commanding a Void King-Grade treasure placed tremendous strain on her.

"Miss Ye, do you truly intend to make enemies of so many of us?" Cheng Pengxuan of the Leitai Sect glared at her, voice heavy with reproach.

Ye cast him a cold glance and replied, "If you all stand idle, I will not trouble you. But if you dare storm this mountain, then see if I will allow it!"

"What arrogance! Do you take us for mud?" Mo Xiaosheng, dark-faced, stepped forward. He had been obstructed from pursuing Yang Kai and felt deeply humiliated; he would not stop here.

"I am no lump of mud either, and I won't say this twice!" Ye answered with stubborn firmness.

Mo Xiaosheng and Cheng Pengxuan exchanged a look and nodded subtly.

Though they were usually at odds and had clashed for years, in this moment they stood on the same front; their mutual familiarity meant a single glance conveyed everything.

"Then I apologize for the offense!" Mo Xiaosheng howled, producing a short ruler of ink-black color in his hand. It looked unremarkable, but when he poured Saint Yuan into it the ruler emitted a world-shaking fluctuation and became a streak of light that smashed toward Ye.

The instant Mo struck, Cheng Pengxuan also attacked.

Time was precious; none wished to be stopped by Ye. They wanted to break through her defense and explore Dragon Lair Mountain's secrets, so they unleashed their most powerful treasures and fiercest attacks.

Cheng Pengxuan summoned a great seal treasure that transformed into a colossal object and crashed down toward Ye.

Jin Shi of the Demon Blood Sect, Old Woman Feng of Myriad Beasts Mountain, and other Origin Returning Realm experts from various factions joined the fray without hesitation, unwilling to be left out.
