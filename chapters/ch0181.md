## Chapter 181 — The Couple Are Like Birds of a Feather

After leaving Yunxia Island for half a month, the large ship seemed to have lost its way. Yu Xiuping's anxiety had caused blisters to form at the corners of his mouth. He was in charge of the Turtle Shell, responsible for leading people to the Hidden Island, which meant the lives of everyone on board rested in his hands. The burden was heavy, yet now he could not find the correct route.

In his agitation, he could no longer treat Miao Lin with the calm demeanor he once had. Yang Kai often saw him shouting angrily at Miao Lin on the deck, demanding information. Naturally, Miao Lin dared not conceal anything and revealed all he knew.

The attacks from demon beasts in the sea had become increasingly frequent and fierce. The two Supreme Elders of Yunxia Sect had participated in battle multiple times; if not for their intervention, this large ship would have likely been shattered by the demon beasts.

Even so, Yunxia Sect had suffered heavy losses. Of the fifty disciples brought along, over a dozen had died, and the more than seventy ordinary people were now reduced to half, the other half having been abandoned in the sea to draw the demon beasts' attention.

On this ship, falling ill was tantamount to being abandoned.

Yang Kai had witnessed what it meant to be ruthless. Faced with those utterly defenseless ordinary people, the warriors of Yunxia Sect tossed them into the sea like livestock, all to buy a little more time as they cried and pleaded.

Life was as cheap as grass here.

The remaining ordinary people lived in constant fear and anxiety.

Three more days passed, and the number of people on the ship dwindled further. Yet the large ship seemed to be spinning in a certain sea area, unable to find the correct location of the Hidden Island.

Miao Lin was slapped several times by the furious Yu Xiuping, leaving him bloodied, yet he dared not complain.

One day, as the night faded and the sun rose in the east, Yang Kai, who was resting in the cabin below, suddenly heard a joyful shout from the deck: “Hidden Island, Hidden Island!”

This shout carried a sense of joy and excitement at escaping a dire situation. It seemed to resonate in everyone's ears.

Thud, thud, thud...

All the warriors of Yunxia Sect sprang into action, rushing to the deck, and the ordinary people followed suit. Yang Kai joined the crowd and climbed onto the deck, lifting his gaze, his expression instantly brightening.

In the light of the newborn sun, several hundred zhang ahead of the ship, a scene of ethereal beauty floated in midair.

It was a paradise-like sight. High mountains and flowing waters, towering peaks, and flocks of birds flying across the sky. The sound of mountain springs trickled in his ears. The view was breathtakingly beautiful, exuding an otherworldly aura.

It seemed like a treasure land that had not been stepped upon for thousands of years, with many rare flowers and herbs, extraordinary spirit medicines swaying in the wind, thriving and lush, filled with the fragrance of birds and flowers.

Many nameless animals flashed before everyone's eyes, running and leaving behind a trail of colorful light.

A mirage!

Yang Kai had been fortunate enough to see such a spectacle once in Haicheng; seeing it again now, he recognized it immediately.

It was said that the scenes appearing in mirages were real, but due to some special reasons, they were reflected from thousands of li away for the world to see.

However, this mirage was somewhat different from the last one he had seen, as it was so vivid that it felt as if he could reach out and touch it, as if it were right before his eyes.

Yu Xiuping was ecstatic, holding the enormous Turtle Shell, examining it closely, and suddenly burst into laughter: “I understand now! The mirage indicates the entrance to the island. No wonder we searched in vain; it turns out to be like this!”

The two Supreme Elders of Yunxia Sect were also somewhat excited at this moment. The elder Ding Jiazi asked in a deep voice, “Xiuping, what’s the situation now?”

The old woman Huo Xianglan also turned her gaze over.

Yu Xiuping did not dare to be negligent, wearing an excited smile as he respectfully replied, “To the two esteemed uncles, I believe we have arrived at the location of the Hidden Island.”

“Where?” Huo Xianglan’s seemingly murky eyes sparkled with a glimmer of light.

Yu Xiuping pointed towards the mirage ahead and said, “Right there!”

After speaking, he hurriedly handed the Turtle Shell to the two Supreme Elders: “Please, esteemed uncles, infuse your Yuan Qi into this island guide. Only with this island guide can we open the entrance to the island!”

Ding Jiazi and Huo Xianglan exchanged glances, not hesitating, and together took the enormous Turtle Shell, then circulated their Yuan Qi, fiercely infusing it into the shell.

This Turtle Shell appeared ordinary, but it was anything but. Usually, no matter how others tested it, they felt nothing unusual. However, at this moment, when Ding Jiazi and Huo Xianglan infused their Yuan Qi, they suddenly discovered that the Turtle Shell transformed into a bottomless pit, wildly devouring their True Yuan.

In just a short time, the two elderly Supreme Elders appeared somewhat unsteady, their faces pale.

“Not good!” Ding Jiazi exclaimed, shouting to the warriors of Yunxia Sect, “What are you all waiting for? Come quickly and lend me a hand!”

Upon hearing this, the warriors of Yunxia Sect rushed over, infusing their own Yuan Qi into the Turtle Shell.

With their assistance, Ding Jiazi and Huo Xianglan managed to stabilize themselves. Before long, the seemingly plain Turtle Shell suddenly burst forth with radiant rainbow light, and a whispering sound seemed to emanate from within, as the engraved route map appeared to come alive, swirling incessantly.

One after another, warriors were drained of their Yuan Qi and withdrew exhausted.

Only after over twenty warriors from Yunxia Sect took turns did the Turtle Shell seem to become full, and the rainbow light shooting from it became as dazzling as the sun.

Suddenly, Ding Jiazi and Huo Xianglan both cried out in surprise as a misty glow erupted from the Turtle Shell, forcing them to retreat.

The Turtle Shell transformed into a streak of flowing light, shooting straight into the sky.

“Esteemed uncles!” Yu Xiuping exclaimed in shock. Ding Jiazi and Huo Xianglan steadied themselves, their faces somewhat pale, but they gestured to indicate they were unharmed.

Everyone looked up to see the Turtle Shell flying several hundred zhang, landing right above the mirage. As streams of rainbow light shot out, the magnificent mirage slowly began to disintegrate.

With the disappearance of the mirage, it was as if an invisible barrier had been broken, and an island much larger than Yunxia Island suddenly appeared in everyone's line of sight.

“Hidden Island!” Yu Xiuping's voice trembled.

On the ship, the warriors of Yunxia Sect fell silent for a moment before suddenly bursting into cheers, shouting loudly to vent their excitement. Their purpose for this journey was to find the Hidden Island, and they had not expected things to go so smoothly. Although they had faced many crises along the way, they had come through unscathed.

Now, the Hidden Island was right before them, and their rise to fame was just around the corner!

Not only the warriors of Yunxia Sect were excited; the ordinary people were also thrilled. They had heard rumors of the Hidden Island, but who would have thought they would witness it in their lifetime?

“Set sail! Target, Hidden Island!” Yu Xiuping suppressed his joy and methodically issued various commands.

However, before the people on the ship could take their positions, an extremely uneasy feeling rose in everyone's hearts. The previously calm sea suddenly began to stir, and bubbles emerged from the water beside the ship, hinting at a boiling sensation.

“What’s happening?” someone asked in panic.

Ding Jiazi and Huo Xianglan's expressions grew serious as their Divine Senses spread out, and their expressions suddenly changed as they shouted in unison, “Be careful!”

Before their words fell, a massive wave surged from the left side of the ship, and a thing resembling a tentacle suddenly emerged from beneath the sea. That tentacle was enormous, over ten zhang long, and with a force like thunder, it struck the deck of the ship directly.

Several ordinary people who could not dodge in time were instantly turned into mush.

With a loud crash, the deck shattered into pieces, scattering in all directions.

The warriors of Yunxia Sect, led by the two Supreme Elders, all rushed towards that tentacle. In an instant, various martial techniques and weapons filled the air.

Yet no matter what kind of attack struck that tentacle, it could not inflict any harm, not even the techniques of the two Supreme Elders could do anything to it.

“Splash…”

On the other side of the ship, another tentacle soared into the air, slamming down. This strike hit the bow of the ship, causing the over twenty zhang long ship to tilt upward at the stern.

The violent shaking made everyone unsteady. Experts above the True Yuan Realm used their True Yuan to fly into the air, while other warriors and ordinary people fled in panic.

“Steady! Everyone, hold steady!” Yu Xiuping shouted hoarsely, but how could he calm the hearts of the people?

Splash, splash, splash...

Seven or eight tentacles simultaneously emerged from the sea, directly wrapping around the ship and dragging it down towards the depths, the immense force making everyone feel as if they were sinking rapidly.

“It must be the guardian beast of the island!” Ding Jiazi, witnessing this scene, was horrified. The strength of this guardian beast exceeded his imagination, and he could not cope with it at all. He called out to Huo Xianglan, “Let’s work together and see if we can drive it away!”

Huo Xianglan nodded solemnly, but before she could act, her eyes widened in shock as she shouted to Ding Jiazi, “Senior Brother Ding, behind you!”

Ding Jiazi was taken aback, feeling a gust of wind rush from behind him. Suddenly, his back was struck hard, and he felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He spat out a mouthful of blood and plummeted like a meteor into the sea.

Before he hit the water, another tentacle emerged from beneath the sea, accurately wrapping around him.

Ding Jiazi let out a horrifying scream, the sound of bones cracking echoed from his body as he desperately urged his True Yuan but could not break free. He reached out a hand toward Huo Xianglan, crying out in despair, “Sister Lan, save me…”

The two Supreme Elders of Yunxia Sect had once shared a tumultuous romance in their youth, loving each other deeply, even marrying. But later, for reasons unknown, they could no longer be as close as before. Though they still had contact privately, it was not the same as in the past.

Now, faced with Ding Jiazi’s plea for help, Huo Xianglan was momentarily stunned, then she activated her movement technique, rushing toward the Hidden Island without looking back.

This demon beast could severely injure Ding Jiazi with a mere gesture; it was certainly beyond her capability to handle!

To save her own life, Huo Xianglan dared not linger. She could not care for Ding Jiazi, nor the countless Yunxia Sect warriors on the ship; the most important thing now was to survive.

Ding Jiazi laughed bitterly, “Couples are like birds of a feather; when disaster strikes, they fly their separate ways, you wretched woman!”
