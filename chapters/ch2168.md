## Chapter 2168 — Five Treasures

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

In front of the grand hall, shadows flickered as the remaining seven each unleashed their own techniques, scrambling forward in a rush. As the saying goes, the one who seizes the initiative gains the greatest advantage. Gong Wenshan was the first to charge inside, making those behind him anxious and restless.

In the blink of an eye, everyone had surged into the grand hall, each finding a spot to stand, squinting as they looked ahead.

Up ahead, multicolored radiance shimmered, Spiritual Qi surged, and it seemed as if some peerless treasure, buried for tens of thousands of years, was waiting for a new master to arrive.

Rumble...

Just as everyone entered, the great doors slowly closed again, emitting a muffled thunderous sound.

Everyone was slightly startled, but quickly calmed their minds, no longer paying attention to the doors and instead scanning the hall to investigate the situation.

What met their eyes was a circular portal at the far right of the hall, its surface swirling with misty light, halos flickering in and out of existence, Spatial Force undulating within. No one knew where it led, and just a glance could make one's mind sink into oblivion.

Thirty zhang ahead of the crowd stood a high platform.

Atop the platform, several items of varying shapes were quietly displayed.

"This is..." As soon as everyone saw the items on the platform clearly, their faces revealed shock and greed.

There weren't many items, only five in total.

A pitch-black oval shield, its surface carved with dragons and phoenixes, intricate runes flickering in and out of sight, exuding profound mystery.

A droplet the size of a cherry, appearing just like a drop of water...

A mass emitting seven-colored radiance, bizarrely soft and flowing like water...

A pellet resembling a Spiritual Pill, yet not quite a pill...

A round bead the size of a longan, blazing red in color...

Five treasures in total, all displayed atop the platform, each one shrouded by a visible semicircular light barrier, as if an invisible giant bowl had been placed over them.

Everyone's gaze swept over the five treasures one by one, finally settling on another semicircular light barrier. Here... it seemed there was originally another treasure, but for some reason, it was missing.

In other words, there were originally six treasures on the platform, but now, strangely, only five remained. No one knew who had snatched the last one away first.

"Gulp..."

Kong Qi swallowed hard, eyes fixed on the pitch-black oval shield as he stammered, “Th-this… could it be a Quasi-Imperial Treasure? I can even sense a faint strand of Imperial Might from it!”

Everyone was dumbstruck, never expecting such a treasure to appear deep within the Time Temple. For a moment, their eyes burned with frenzy, unable to contain their excitement as they stared at the five treasures atop the platform.

Though their hearts itched with desire, none dared to make a move.

They all knew this clearly. There were eight people here, but only five treasures—far from enough to go around. If anyone acted rashly, they would likely become the target of the others, and at that point, two fists could not fend off four hands; they might be eliminated immediately.

Even someone as forceful as Luo Yuan suppressed his restless urge, constantly observing the expressions of the others.

"Princess, you are knowledgeable. Do you recognize what these things are?" Gong Wenshan suddenly turned to Lan Xun and asked.

Lan Xun's beautiful eyes sparkled. She smiled and replied, "I recognize a few..."

"Please enlighten us, Princess!" Gong Wenshan said earnestly.

Lan Xun inclined her delicate head, pointed at the pitch-black oval shield, and said, “Brother Kong is not mistaken—this one should indeed be a Quasi-Imperial Treasure.”

"What is a Quasi-Imperial Treasure?" Yang Kai asked, genuinely perplexed.

At these words, everyone gave him strange looks, as if surprised that someone could be ignorant of such a basic fact.

Bian Yuqing understood that Yang Kai truly was inexperienced, having come from a lower Star Domain, so she kindly explained, "Imperial Treasures are not forged. You should know that, right?"

Yang Kai nodded slightly.

The birth of an Imperial Treasure requires a martial artist to spend years refining and nurturing it. Only after a martial artist advances to the Emperor Realm and infuses their own Martial Dao insights into a Secret Treasure can an Imperial Treasure be born.

"Some Emperor Realm cultivators fail to refine their Secret Treasures as they wish, for various reasons, but the power of the Secret Treasure is not lost—in fact, it may even increase. In such cases, the resulting Secret Treasure is a Quasi-Imperial Treasure. It surpasses Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasures but does not reach the level of an Imperial Treasure, making it a kind of half-finished item!" Bian Yuqing spoke softly, her expression solemn. "A good Quasi-Imperial Treasure is not inferior to a typical Imperial Treasure, but some are only slightly better than Dao Origin-Grade ones."

"I see!" Yang Kai said, looking enlightened.

Bian Yuqing continued, "However... this is a defensive Secret Treasure. Even as a Quasi-Imperial Treasure, it is extremely rare! Its value far exceeds that of an Upper-Level Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure! If you obtain this shield, no one below the Emperor Realm could break through its defense!"

"This is truly a fine item!" Yang Kai agreed, his gaze toward the shield growing even more fervent.

Although he possessed several Imperial Treasures, none were defensive types. If he could seize this shield, it would make up for his shortcomings, allowing him to withstand powerful enemies, at least for a time.

"Princess, please continue!" Kong Qi glared at Yang Kai, as if blaming him for his ignorance interrupting Lan Xun's explanation.

Lan Xun didn't mind, smiling as she pointed to the cherry-sized droplet, "If I'm not mistaken, this should be the legendary Taiyi Divine Water!"

"Hiss..." A collective gasp sounded as everyone was shocked.

"So it really is Taiyi Divine Water..." Gong Wenshan's expression flickered, as if he had suspected but hadn't dared to confirm, but after hearing Lan Xun's words, he immediately accepted it.

Murong Xiaoxiao exclaimed, "Is that the kind of water that can make Spiritual Medicine grow rapidly with just a single drop?"

"Exactly!" Lan Xun nodded with a smile. Whether for Yang Kai's sake or not, she patiently explained, "Taiyi Divine Water—just one drop, and any kind of Spiritual Medicine can mature to a thousand or even ten thousand years old in an extremely short time. And that time... is only a month."

Yang Kai swallowed and asked, "Princess, do you mean... if this is dripped onto a Spiritual Herb, the Spiritual Medicine can reach ten thousand years of age in just a month?"

"That's right!" Lan Xun nodded calmly. "Although Taiyi Divine Water is not ranked among the Three Divine Waters, in terms of efficacy, it is sometimes even more precious. I saw a few drops myself when I was young, so I recognize it."

If anyone else claimed to have seen Taiyi Divine Water, people might doubt it, but coming from Lan Xun, it was different. Her status and background meant she would not lie about such things. If she said she had seen it, then she truly had.

Yang Kai's heart burned with excitement.

In his Small Xuan Realm's medicine garden, there was so much Heavy Earth, which only allowed Spiritual Medicine to grow a hundred times faster. In other words, it took a year for a Spiritual Medicine to reach a hundred years of age.

But this Taiyi Divine Water could make Spiritual Medicine reach ten thousand years of age in just a month!

The difference was simply incalculable...

If this drop of Taiyi Divine Water were absorbed by the Gold-and-Silver Firmament Tree, wouldn't it gain ten thousand more years of sealing power? With so much sealing power, he could lift the seal on his abdomen at any time and fight powerful enemies without worry.

At that time, he would only need to use the Firmament Tree's power to reseal the Demonic Qi and demonic thoughts.

"Taiyi Divine Water is the source of all waters. Its uses are not limited to this. If a martial artist who cultivates water-based techniques or has a water attribute physique absorbs it, the benefits are immeasurable. Moreover... it can be used to refine water-type Secret Treasures, with endless wonderful uses!" Lan Xun continued her explanation.

Gong Wenshan let out a slow breath and cupped his fists, "I am enlightened. Thank you, Princess!"

"Hmph, Princess is kindly explaining all this to you. You'd better show some gratitude later!" Xiao Chen snorted coldly from the side.

No one paid him any mind...

Lan Xun then pointed to the treasure emitting seven-colored radiance, flowing like water, "I don't need to say much about this one. Surely you all recognize it?"

Kong Qi's face twitched as he said hoarsely, "Is this... the Imperial Aura?"

"It is definitely the Imperial Aura!" Gong Wenshan agreed, speaking in a deep voice.

Lan Xun smiled, "That's right, this is the Imperial Aura! With it, you can fuse it into your own Secret Treasure, and given time, you may be able to create an Imperial Treasure!"

The Imperial Aura is the key to creating an Imperial Treasure; it is condensed by Emperor Realm experts and fused into a Secret Treasure. If successful, it becomes an Imperial Treasure; if not, the Secret Treasure may be damaged or become a Quasi-Imperial Treasure!

Normally, Emperor Realm experts infuse their own Imperial Aura directly into their Secret Treasures. Imperial Aura contains the essence, energy, and spirit of the Emperor Realm expert, making it extremely rare.

But a visible mass of Imperial Aura like this cannot be condensed by ordinary Emperor Realm experts. Even someone as strong as Xiao Chen's father, Star Envoy Xiao Yuyang, could not do it.

Only experts at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm can achieve this!

And condensing a mass of Imperial Aura is a huge loss for an Emperor Realm expert, requiring at least a hundred years of bitter cultivation to recover. So, in general, Third Stage Emperor Realm experts would never condense Imperial Aura and leave it outside.

Yet the Time Temple had one!

This thing and that pitch-black shield were fundamentally different. The black shield had already taken form; it was a Quasi-Imperial Treasure, with no possibility of ever advancing into an Imperial Treasure. But this cluster of Imperial Resonance represented boundless potential—it only required time and effort. As for which of the two held greater value, that was truly impossible to say.

If one preferred something ready-made, one would naturally choose that pitch-black shield; it was, after all, a defensive Secret Treasure, and its worth and rarity needed no explanation.

But if one harbored the ambition to temper an Imperial Treasure of their own, then without a doubt one would set their heart on that cluster of Imperial Resonance.
