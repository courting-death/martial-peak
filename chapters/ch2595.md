## Chapter 2595 — Not Dead

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Zhang Ruoxi suddenly threw herself over the edge of the large pit, falling to her knees. Using both hands, she desperately clawed at the dirt covering the hole, tears streaming down her cheeks as she sobbed, "Sir, sir..."

Her choked cries were filled with utter grief, and she seemed to have lost all sense, not even using her Origin Qi—just her bare, bloodied hands to fling the earth aside.

In the blink of an eye, her slender fingers were a bloody mess, but she seemed not to feel any pain, still digging with all her might.

Her grief and despair were so intense they seemed to take on physical form, spreading outwards and touching the hearts of every yao and Stone Spirit present. Each tear that fell from her eyes gradually took on a faint crimson hue, as if what she wept was not merely tears, but a mingling of blood and sorrow—a silent accusation against the heavens themselves.

"Don't leave Ruoxi behind, Sir, don't leave Ruoxi behind..."

Her vision blurred by blood and tears, Zhang Ruoxi could barely see, but her hands kept working mechanically, trying to rescue Yang Kai from beneath the earth.

"This little girl..." Fan Wu narrowed his eyes, frowning slightly as he stared at Zhang Ruoxi's kneeling back, his feelings complicated.

"Her relationship with that young man seems quite close, but her strength is far too low," Luan Feng also sighed softly. Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm—what could she possibly do here? Any random Yao King here was at least Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. The Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was simply not enough.

"Hmph!" Shi Huo shot Zhang Ruoxi a sidelong glance, then suddenly snorted coldly and reached out to grab her.

He was the one who had gone back on his word and ambushed Yang Kai. Now, with a human woman making a scene at Yang Kai's burial site, wasn't this just poking at his sore spot?

Ruoxi, completely unprepared, was caught around the waist by his massive palm.

The five-zhang-tall Shi Huo held Zhang Ruoxi as if she were a tiny doll in his grasp.

As the distance between her and Yang Kai grew, Zhang Ruoxi suddenly snapped out of her daze. She lifted her head, her bloodshot eyes staring at the Shi Huo who was scrutinizing her up close. Suddenly, she began to struggle with all her might, kicking and punching as she pleaded, "Let me go, please, let me go! I have to save Sir, Sir isn't dead yet, I have to save him!"

But how could her strength compare to Shi Huo's? No matter how she struggled, she couldn't budge him in the slightest.

Shi Huo sneered. "That sir of yours is already dead and gone. Stop wasting your effort."

Ruoxi shook her head, tears pouring down like rain. "I don't believe it, I don't believe it! Sir can't die, sir absolutely won't die!"

Shi Huo snapped angrily, "You stubborn little girl! Do you really believe I won't crush you to death right here and now?"

Gritting her teeth, Ruoxi suddenly raised her hand, and a large, square seal appeared out of thin air.

The Myriad Beasts Seal!

From within the seal, streams of pitch-black energy suddenly shot forth, instantly filling the air with a chilling gloom. The mournful ghostly wails echoed all around as the black energies twisted and transformed in a blink, each one becoming a demonic beast of varying shapes and sizes.

"Beast souls!" Shi Huo's brow twitched as he looked in surprise at the seemingly insubstantial demonic beasts before him.

With his eyesight, he immediately recognized these things as beast souls.

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou also frowned slightly. They were the Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land, commanding billions of yao. For so many beast souls to suddenly emerge from Zhang Ruoxi's Myriad Beasts Seal made them somewhat angry. After all, every yao was one of their subordinates—even in death, their beast souls shouldn't be sealed away in a Secret Treasure by a human.

This Secret Treasure was absolutely intolerable to the yao of the Ancient Land.

In the brief moment the Four Great Saint Venerables were distracted, tens of thousands of beast souls surged from the Myriad Beasts Seal, and their numbers were still increasing. Each beast soul radiated a different power, and many were not much weaker than the Yao Kings present.

"Where did so many beast souls come from!" Shi Huo's expression finally changed.

If the Myriad Beasts Seal only contained dozens or hundreds of beast souls, it could be explained as the result of this woman sealing the souls of demonic beasts she had slain. But tens of thousands, with Twelfth-Tier demonic beasts everywhere...

That was truly shocking. And judging by the situation, it seemed the Myriad Beasts Seal still held even more beast souls.

"Little girl, did you go into the Tomb of All Spirits?" Shi Huo blurted out a wild guess.

As he spoke, he slapped the Myriad Beasts Seal. Divine Spirit power surged forth, causing the seal to flash wildly and its spirit to be greatly damaged.

The tens of thousands of beast souls that had flown out were instantly sucked back into the Myriad Beasts Seal the moment it was attacked, unable to accomplish anything at all.

The difference in strength was simply too great. Even with the Myriad Beasts Seal, Ruoxi couldn't trouble Shi Huo in the slightest.

With a casual flick of his massive hand, Shi Huo tossed Zhang Ruoxi aside, saying coldly, "This little girl's Secret Treasure is suspicious. I need to examine it thoroughly."

Luan Feng nodded slightly, reaching out to pull Zhang Ruoxi over and restrain her in front of herself, leaving her unable to move.

Meanwhile, Shi Huo toyed with the Myriad Beasts Seal in his hand, sending his Divine Sense inside. After a moment of investigation, his face suddenly changed and he cried out in shock, "A million beast souls!"

"What?" Fan Wu and the others were all visibly shaken.

For a Myriad Beasts Seal to contain a million beast souls—never mind who forged this Secret Treasure—where did all those souls come from? They all realized the gravity of the situation. In the entire Star Realm, only the Wild Ancient Land could possibly provide a million beast souls, and within the Wild Ancient Land, there was only one place with that many...

The Tomb of All Spirits!

Did this little girl really enter the Tomb of All Spirits? Was Shi Huo's wild guess actually correct?

"Little girl, what's your name?" Luan Feng asked in surprise, staring at the still-struggling Zhang Ruoxi.

Zhang Ruoxi didn't answer, just kept trying to rush forward. But in front of Luan Feng, how could she possibly move? Even shifting her body was impossible.

"Splash..."

A strange sound drew everyone's attention. From the dirt-filled pit, a large, blood-soaked hand suddenly reached out, as if it had emerged from the Nine Nether Purgatory, exuding a chilling aura.

Shi Huo's eyes went wide in an instant.

Fan Wu, Luan Feng, and Cang Gou also stared in shock.

All the Yao Kings and the Stone Spirits were equally dumbfounded.

"I knew it—you weren't dead, I just knew you couldn't be dead!" Xie Wuwei murmured under his breath, his emotions surging like a rollercoaster—soaring and plummeting, his heart pounding with nervous excitement.

But soon, Xie Wuwei slapped his thigh in frustration, cursing inwardly, "Idiot! Since you're not dead, you should have hidden yourself and fooled everyone. Why come out now? This is the height of stupidity! Now you've dragged me down with you. Why is my life so bitter!"

"Not dead?" Shi Huo stared in disbelief at the hand reaching out from the earth, wishing he could pluck out his own eyes and take a closer look.

"That young man... what's going on?" Luan Feng was also stunned, shocked by Yang Kai's tenacious vitality.

With only the First Stage of the Emperor Realm cultivation, ambushed by Shi Huo and smashed into the ground, how could he possibly still be alive?

Under everyone's gaze, the hand suddenly withdrew, and then, with a loud bang, the dirt covering the pit was blasted away by a surge of power. A figure staggered out of the pit, coughing violently, spitting out clotted blood, and clutching his chest as he stood there.

Who else could it be but Yang Kai?

Zhang Ruoxi, her face streaked with tears and eyes bloodshot, stared blankly ahead. Her body went limp and she collapsed to the ground, both hands covering her mouth as sobs escaped uncontrollably, her delicate shoulders trembling violently.

She didn't dare let herself cry out loud, afraid her sobs would disturb Yang Kai's state of mind.

"Shi Huo!" Yang Kai clenched his fists so tightly his knuckles turned white, glaring at the spiked Stone Giant with eyes burning with fury.

If he hadn't used the Nothingness secret technique at the critical moment to banish himself into the void, he would have been smashed to pieces by Shi Huo.

Even so, the Nothingness secret technique couldn't fully withstand Shi Huo's blow. The space itself was affected, and before the residual force dissipated, his technique was forcibly broken, and the injuries he suffered were all from the aftershocks of Shi Huo's attack.

A dignified Divine Spirit, going back on his word was one thing, but to ambush him as well—this grudge was enormous.

"You've got some luck, kid. To survive a blow from this Lord, you're the first!" Shi Huo stood there brazenly, feeling no shame for his ambush, tossing the Myriad Beasts Seal up and down as he looked at Yang Kai with contempt.

Seeing the Myriad Beasts Seal, Yang Kai couldn't help but pause, glancing around until he quickly spotted Zhang Ruoxi.

He didn't know when Ruoxi had arrived, but in his dazed state earlier, he vaguely heard her cries.

Now, Ruoxi was collapsed on the ground, hands tightly covering her mouth, her delicate body trembling, her tear-filled eyes brimming with joy and heartache.

What had just happened had clearly frightened her.

Yang Kai let out a deep sigh, the hostility and anger in his eyes gradually fading. He unclenched his fists, turned his gaze to Fan Wu, and said, "As for Shi Huo's ambush, I won't hold it against him. As agreed, I've released the Soul Brand from the Mountain and River Bell. Now I need to take my friends and leave. Do the Saint Venerables have any objections?"

Fan Wu's eyes flickered and he nodded. "No objections."

Though his tone was calm, there was a hint of admiration in his eyes. He had seen Yang Kai's murderous rage just now—anyone ambushed and nearly killed would be furious.

But not everyone could suppress their anger and act with such composure and flexibility.

For Yang Kai to adjust his mood so quickly showed his remarkable temperament and cultivation.

This was the wisest, even the only, choice. If he let anger drive him to fight a hopeless battle, he would only suffer for it.
