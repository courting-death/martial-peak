## Chapter 1545 — Death Domain

In the endless Star Domain, a black warship glided steadily—its speed seemingly moderate, yet in truth it raced like wind and lightning, covering tens to hundreds of li in an instant.

Through the transparent windows, everyone gazed at the enormous star beside the warship and clicked their tongues in astonishment.

Many among them had never observed Dark Star from this angle; only now did they realize how majestic and awe-inspiring the world that had given them birth truly was, and each person felt a spontaneous surge of reverence.

The warship moved at tremendous speed yet remained remarkably stable; inside the hull, no one felt any jolts or tremors.

Chaotic meteorites drifted past, and lifeless dead stars lay like cold giants, slumbering within the Star Domain.

The region stretching a million li outward from Dark Star into the Star Domain was considered safe.

The great powers on Dark Star who possessed warships often dispatched vessels into this region to seek and harvest minerals; though gains were usually meager, it did not dampen their enthusiasm—occasionally one could still find something worthwhile among those meteors and dead stars.

Those things were not born of Dark Star.

But beyond that million li lay danger.

There the Star Domain’s fierce winds blew year-round, capable of easily destroying a warship; starry storms of all sizes formed and perished here almost everywhere, and the speeding meteorites could smash any living being or moving object that dared intrude to pieces.

The Death Domain!

This was the first barrier that cut Dark Star off from the outside world, and it was the most unbreakable of shields!

It was like a protective membrane, encircling Dark Star a million li out, allowing no one to leave and preventing any from entering.

For tens of thousands of years, many had attempted to leave Dark Star to explore the wider heavens and witness a grander world, yet none succeeded; all were halted outside this Death Domain.

As the warship entered here, everyone’s palms clenched with anxiety.

Yang Kai ordered his disciples to raise the warship’s defenses to the utmost, ignoring the consumption of Origin Saint Crystals.

The fierce Star Domain winds swept in like an unseen beast, raking the warship with razor claws, intent on tearing it apart and dragging out those sheltering within as prey.

Sharp, grating sounds of friction rang from the warship’s exterior, creaking and groaning; every face grew pale.

Massive meteorites borne on the gale struck the hull with thuds, and the whole warship trembled.

Like a dugout canoe tossed on savage waves, the warship careened left and right through the Death Domain, staggering and swaying; the disciples could not steer it—they could only drift with the current and resign themselves to fate.

Alarms and terrified cries from the disciples kept rising.

Yang Kai shouted sharply; his Divine Sense left his body to scout the outside and direct the disciples’ actions.

Yang Xiuzhu and four other top experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm rushed into the engine room at Yang Kai’s command, seating themselves upon the formation and urging Saint Yuan to its utmost, pouring their power into the warship to lend it some aid.

They were bargaining with death.

Not a single mistake could be tolerated; any negligence might mean shipwreck and death.

In such a terrifying region, the strength of a single person was far too paltry—this Death Domain beyond Dark Star would swallow even Void King Realm practitioners who tried to force their way through, let alone those aboard the warship.

Only united effort could overcome the crisis.

The chaotic situation gradually steadied. Once they realized the warship, though battered, remained impregnable, the panic ebbed and everyone calmly resumed their duties; order returned.

A close call. The Void King-Grade warship Yang Yan had forged provided the people with a safe and reliable guarantee.

Only after a full month did Lingxiao Sect’s warship finally wrench free of the Death Domain’s clutches and streak into the vast Star Domain.

Strange noises ceased outside and the shaking stopped; when the disciples confirmed they had truly left Dark Star, the warship erupted in thunderous cheers—tears of relief and inexplicable excitement filled every face.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others appeared before Yang Kai with ashen faces, each like a frost-covered eggplant, their vital breath all but spent.

"Thank you all for your hard work," Yang Kai nodded to them.

"Yang Kai, did you sense anything?" Qian Tong asked gravely as he looked at him.

Yang Kai gave a slight nod.

He had perceived something the instant the warship plunged into the Death Domain, but the past month had been fraught with peril and his life hung by a thread, so he had not had time to ponder it deeply.

Now that they had escaped the Death Domain, he finally had space to recall that feeling.

"I thought perhaps I was mistaken," Qian Tong said seriously, "so it seems you sensed it too."

"Imperial Might!" Mo Yu added, "that Death Domain was saturated with Imperial Might—in fact, there were more than one."

"Indeed, there were two strands of Imperial Might," Qian Tong nodded lightly. "One resembles the aura that emanates from Imperial Garden, while the other is unfamiliar—what could that be?"

"I have a guess, but I can’t be certain..." Mo Yu said, wearing a contemplative look.

Everyone turned to him.

Mo Yu’s face twitched, his eyes full of awe. Smacking his lips, he said hoarsely, “If I tell you, you’ll definitely think I’ve gone mad.”

"You won’t," Qian Tong shook his head. "Old Mo, speak freely."

Yang Kai agreed, "That’s right—say it and we’ll judge for ourselves."

Mo Yu forced a wry smile. "I always considered myself knowledgeable, yet after forcing through the Death Domain I know I was like a frog at the bottom of a well. Fine, I’ll tell you my view—whether I’m right I don’t know, and don’t mock me; It's only a conjecture and I have no solid proof..."

"Enough rambling, spit it out!" Yang Xiuzhu impatiently cut him off.

"The Death Domain was filled with two differing airs of Imperial Might, and those two Imperial Mights were entangled in conflict, ebbing and flowing in turn. I thought the aura we know was the Imperial Might of Imperial Garden’s master, the Starry Sky Emperor! The other one I don’t recognize, but it should be someone of equal rank to the Great Emperor!" Mo Yu said gravely. "Perhaps the Death Domain formed... because of a battle between these two figures."

After speaking, Mo Yu fell silent.

Qian Tong gaped, staring at him in stupefaction.

Yang Kai and Yang Xiuzhu exchanged glances and appeared fairly composed.

"Heh, that seems unlikely?" Mo Yu chuckled dryly, "I fear I may have been mistaken."

The Great Emperor had become legend; whether he truly existed none could prove. Now to imagine another figure of equal stature who had contended with him—Mo Yu himself found the hypothesis hard to accept.

“Senior Mo is likely right,” Yang Kai said with a slight nod, affirming his guess.

"Huh?" Mo Yu looked at Yang Kai in surprise, his face suddenly brightening as he hurriedly asked, "Yang Kai, do you know something?"

Qian Tong abruptly turned and fixed his eager gaze on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “I don’t know much either, but I do know the Great Emperor once had a rival—one whose strength was no less, and the two truly did battle.”

Yang Xiuzhu and the others were aware of this matter, but Qian Tong and Mo Yu heard it for the first time.

Both of them went slack-jawed and stared at Yang Kai in stunned silence, only their breathing audible.

“So the reason Dark Star is so tightly sealed… turns out the culprit was her!” Yang Kai murmured.

The Death Domain’s conditions were the best evidence: the two strands of Imperial Might remained entangled there, their contest lasting tens of thousands of years without resolution.

Perhaps Yang Yan and that unknown enemy once fought a great battle in the Star Domain, resulting in this isolating barrier beyond Dark Star.

The ancient Taixuan Sect must have been one of the battlefields in the distant past—though it’s unclear whether it preceded or followed the formation of the Death Domain.

Qian Tong and Mo Yu seemed about to ask more, but Yang Kai gave them no chance. "You’ve all been exhausted this past month; return and rest for now. Having broken through the Death Domain, the remaining journey is safe—we likely won’t encounter any living beings for years, so you may close yourselves off to cultivate."

Hearing this, Qian Tong and the others fell silent, nodded, and returned to their cabins.

Yang Kai stood where he was, his gaze lifting toward the boundless starry sky. Stepping up to the Star Chart, he placed his hand upon it, sank his mind into the Sea of Consciousness, and manifested his Spirit Body.

Above the Sea of Consciousness hovered a vast starry expanse shrunk countless times over, like a gigantic blueprint, silently suspended.

This was Yang Kai’s Star Chart!

For Dark Star’s cultivators, the first hurdle to leave their home and enter the Star Domain was the Death Domain; no one could cross it.

The second hurdle was orientation.

The Star Domain held many perils, and when a warship navigated it, experienced guides were needed to direct its course; this duty generally fell to specialists known as Chartmasters.

Chartmasters could draw Star Charts to allow cultivators or warships to proceed safely and effectively through the Star Domain, avoiding hazardous regions.

Without a Star Chart drawn by a Chartmaster, a warship would very likely become lost in the Star Domain, straying from its destination.

Because Dark Star had been so isolated, the profession of Chartmaster had never arisen there and no one could draw Star Charts; on other cultivation stars Chartmasters were highly valued—occupying a status comparable to alchemists and artificers.

Yang Kai’s Star Chart within his Sea of Consciousness was an inheritance obtained from a Chartmaster named Wusuo.

He had acquired it by chance when he first set foot into the Star Domain.

With this Star Chart, Yang Kai needed no study—he was born the finest Chartmaster. The layout of the entire Star Domain presented itself in his mind, including the cultivation star where Tongxuan Continent lay.

He had taken Qian Yue to see it, and he himself often gazed at that star, his heart bound to it.

Over the years he had not had an opportunity to use the Star Chart for guidance.

Now it finally came into play.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept through the immense Star Chart, and his Divine Sense’s power was consumed rapidly as he soon locked onto a region.

That was where Qian Yue and Su Yan had parted ways all those years ago.

Yang Kai prepared to make that place his first stop.
