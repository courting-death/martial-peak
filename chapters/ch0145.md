## Chapter 145 — The Combined Forces of Three Sects

With a single command, nearly all the remaining disciples of the Lingxiao Pavilion surged forward.

“Elder Sister!” Hu Mei’er turned her head, looking anxiously at Hu Jiao’er.

“Jiao’er, let’s not get involved in this mess. Who knows if that demon beast still has the strength to retaliate? It’s better for us to observe the situation and see what the people from Lingxiao Pavilion do…” 

“Shut up! Coward!” Hu Mei’er glared fiercely at Long Jun.

Long Jun was taken aback.

Hu Jiao’er forced a smile, glancing at her sister and then at Yang Kai, a hint of tenderness flashing in her eyes before she shouted, “Blood Battle Gang, step forward to help!”

With that, she dashed ahead.

On the side of Fengyu Tower, Du Yishuang also watched anxiously at Fang Ziqi, whispering, “He saved my life.”

Fang Ziqi pinched his nose, “If I say we should just sit back and watch the tiger fight…”

“I will despise you, and look down on you for life!” Du Yishuang stared unflinchingly at her senior brother.

“Alas…” Fang Ziqi sighed helplessly, “What can I do now that you’ve said that?”

Then he let out a long laugh, “Today, having witnessed such bold heroes, how could I, Fang Ziqi, fall behind! Disciples of Fengyu Tower, heed my command, let us charge forth and show them that the men of Fengyu Tower are true men!”

“Roar!” The male disciples of Fengyu Tower shouted in unison.

“Senior Brother Fang, what about us? What about the female disciples?” Du Yishuang relentlessly pressed.

“Step aside and watch; you girls just need to focus on supporting your husbands and raising children, why bother with so much?” With that, he led a group of people charging towards the demon beast.

“Hmph!” Du Yishuang wrinkled her nose, “You only care about men! I won’t be any worse than you!”

Saying this, she also rushed forward.

After so many days, only seven or eight hundred disciples from the three sects remained, and many of those had already perished within this Inheritance Celestial Cave. Yet, at this moment, a full eighty percent of those remaining surged forward.

The remaining twenty percent were either injured and unable to fight or felt their strength too low to be of any help.

The roar of battle shook the heavens; the disciples of the three sects, three forces, three directions, but with only one target—the tortoise-shaped demon beast that had been blasted to the ground.

Yang Kai’s punch seemed to have dealt it a heavy blow; although it didn’t take its life, it appeared unable to move for the time being.

The people from Lingxiao Pavilion were the first to charge in. With bloodshot eyes, they unleashed their most skilled martial techniques, launching fierce attacks on the tortoise-shaped demon beast, creating sparks that flew in all directions.

The Blood Battle Gang followed closely, and then came Fengyu Tower.

Among these people, only a handful had reached the True Yuan Realmust a few remained, with Su Yan having lost her combat ability, Jie Hongchen still dazed in mid-air, leaving only Fang Ziqi, Long Jun, and Hu Jiao’er.

Moreover, all of them were martial artists at the first or second layer of the True Yuan Realm. Such strength found it difficult to inflict any effective damage on the tortoise-shaped demon beast, known for its defense.

They unleashed their techniques, expending their Yuan Qi, but it didn’t seem to have any effect.

Even so, none of the disciples from the three sects showed any signs of retreat or discouragement; they continued to unleash their killing moves, the area where the tortoise-shaped demon beast was located filled with the sounds of clashing attacks.

Yang Kai stood in place, laughing.

He felt that at last, his long-accumulated Mark of the Stars had not been wasted; it was enough to ignite their fighting spirit.

Su Yan stared blankly, watching what could almost be called a miracle unfold before her eyes.

The disciples of the three sects had always been embroiled in conflict, especially after entering this Inheritance Celestial Cave. The open and covert struggles had become increasingly apparent. She disliked fighting, so she had been acting alone for these days; otherwise, with her status and prestige, all the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion would gather around her at a single call.

This time, Jie Hongchen had stirred up a huge mess. She had no choice but to intervene, initially thinking that Lingxiao Pavilion was doomed. Yet unexpectedly, the situation had taken a turn.

And this turn was brought about by the man before her.

Never had anyone been able to make the disciples of the three sects cooperate so seamlessly. In their eyes now, there was no fighting, no deceit—only the singular thought of killing the tortoise-shaped demon beast!

This itself was a miracle!

Looking at his still trembling and bleeding right arm, Su Yan felt a twinge of pain in her heart.

She wanted to step forward to help him heal, but she held back.

Because at this moment, this man represented iron-blooded resolve; if she stepped forward, it would bring softness. In such a time, he did not need to be softened by tenderness.

As her heart stirred, Su Yan suddenly saw the girl from the Blood Battle Gang, Hu Mei’er, hurriedly approaching Yang Kai, her face filled with anxiety and concern as she inquired about his injuries. She then took out healing medicine from her bosom and tore her own clothing to bandage him.

Su Yan’s beautiful eyes flickered, and she slowly turned her gaze away.

On the battlefield, perhaps the attacks from the disciples of the three sects had awakened the tortoise-shaped demon beast; its previously chaotic mind gradually cleared, and its massive body began to show signs of movement, its heavy limbs starting to move.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s hearts tightened, and their attacks grew even fiercer.

“Hit its head; there’s a wound on its head!” Suddenly, a woman’s shout rang out; it was Du Yishuang from Fengyu Tower.

Upon hearing her shout, Fang Ziqi and Hu Jiao’er quickly rushed over, their eyes widening in shock.

They discovered that there was indeed a crack-like wound on the tortoise-shaped demon beast’s forehead, from which bright red blood was flowing.

Since its head had been buried in a deep pit, it was hard to notice unless one got close.

“Damn!” Fang Ziqi couldn’t help but curse; he had struck for so long without leaving a mark on the tortoise-shaped demon beast, yet here was a wound over a foot long.

This was the mark left by Yang Kai’s punch! Just how powerful was his fist to cause such an effect?

Although his mind was shocked, Fang Ziqi did not hesitate, rushing forward with Hu Jiao’er to strike at that wound.

The collision of their techniques caused the tortoise-shaped demon beast’s body to spasm, its movements becoming even more pronounced.

“Get out of the way, woman!” Fang Ziqi shouted at Hu Jiao’er, unable to contain his annoyance.

“You only see men, you fool; I won’t stoop to your level!” Hu Jiao’er shot him a glare.

The personality of Fang Ziqi was well known among the disciples of the three sects; he was a staunch advocate of male superiority, believing that only men could achieve great things, while women were nothing in his eyes. Only Su Yan could make him regard her with a bit more respect.

It was rumored that he once incessantly advised the master of Fengyu Tower, his mentor Xiao Ruohan, to stop recruiting female disciples in the future. Xiao Ruohan initially ignored him, but eventually, after being pestered, the two of them had to visit the Chunfeng Xiyu Tower in Wumei Town together.

Since then, Fang Ziqi had stopped mentioning this matter, but his deeply ingrained thoughts had never changed.

Of course, he didn’t dislike women. It was just that in his mind, men and women were two different species, with the former being far superior to the latter.

“I am a man, and I am proud! I am a man, and I am honored!”

Logically speaking, with such thoughts, Fang Ziqi should have treated women with disdain.

Yet he was extremely charming and suave, coupled with his youth and strength, and his handsome appearance meant that he was never short of female company, often surrounded by beautiful girls.

He was a man of extreme contradictions.

Hearing Hu Jiao’er’s words, Fang Ziqi’s brows furrowed, and while fiercely attacking the wound on the demon beast’s head, he shouted, “You little girl, who are you calling a fool?”

Hu Jiao’er’s hands flew, unleashing powerful killing moves into that wound without showing any weakness, “Stupid man! If you truly hate women so much, why not go indulge with your junior brothers, singing and dancing every night?”

As soon as these words left her mouth, Fang Ziqi’s face turned pale, his stomach churning, nearly making him vomit on the spot.

With those junior brothers…

Just thinking of such a scene made Fang Ziqi dizzy and unsteady.

Seeing his face change, Hu Jiao’er burst into laughter, her voice filled with triumph and schadenfreude.

“You shameless girl, you dare to say anything!” Fang Ziqi felt overwhelmed, “Whoever marries you will be out of luck!”

“None of your business!” Hu Jiao’er’s face flushed, shooting him a glare.

Fang Ziqi said, “I won’t argue with you; let’s see who can deal the fatal blow to this demon beast first.”

“Hmph, do you think I’m afraid of you?” Hu Jiao’er sneered.

But before the two could launch their attacks, a pure white figure suddenly darted over, carrying an icy chill. With her delicate fingers pointing downwards, a pure white ice flower suddenly appeared in the wound of the demon beast.

The ice flower absorbed the demon beast’s blood, and in the blink of an eye, it transformed into a blood-colored flower, exuding a bewitching beauty.

With a crack, the ice flower shattered, turning into countless sharp ice spikes that pierced into the demon beast’s skull.

“Roar…” The tortoise-shaped demon beast abruptly pulled its head out of the deep pit, letting out an enraged roar, its massive body swaying unsteadily, its crimson eyes dimming, clearly on the verge of collapse.

Fang Ziqi and Hu Jiao’er turned their heads simultaneously, only to see Su Yan, her face pale as snow, using the last bit of strength she had just recovered to unleash a killing move.

After finishing her attack, Su Yan turned and fell, unable to continue fighting.

Fang Ziqi and Hu Jiao’er clearly felt that the chill emanating from Su Yan this time was somewhat different from before.

The previous chill had been pure coldness, an absolute freeze, a kind of extreme cold that contained no other attributes.

But now, this chill seemed to carry something else, making it even more unbearable than before.

“Who provoked her?” Fang Ziqi voiced his confusion.

“How would I know?” Hu Jiao’er replied impatiently. Coming from the Blood Battle Gang, she thought the disciples of the other two sects were all no good.

As for Fang Ziqi, he was the epitome of male superiority.

On the side of Lingxiao Pavilion, Su Yan was indeed a remarkable figure, but she seemed like an emotionless ice doll, forever keeping others at a distance, making it hard to approach her. As for Jie Hongchen, there was no need to mention him; he was a complete coward, merely someone who worshipped fame and pursued power.

The Blood Battle Gang was stronger; at least she considered herself normal, waiting for her little sister to grow up so that they could support their father together.

“If no one provoked her, why did she use her just-recovered Yuan Qi?” Fang Ziqi couldn’t understand, shaking his head. Seeing Hu Jiao’er seizing the opportunity to attack the tortoise-shaped demon beast fiercely, he couldn’t help but explode in anger, “You woman, doing this, even if you win, it’s still an unfair victory!”
