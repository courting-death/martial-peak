## Chapter 1835 — Arrived a Little Late

On Dark Star above the Wuyou Sea, the waters lay calm and vast, and a middle-aged martial artist hovered in midair wearing a white robe that made him stand out, his bearing extraordinary.

He closed his eyes and felt the surging Heaven-and-Earth Energy around him, sniffing the scent of the Laws, a pleased expression appearing on his face.

"The Spiritual Qi is not ordinary, the laws may not be perfect, but they are quite good — just the thing to replenish myself after such a long journey," the middle-aged man said as he moved his hands, forming a strange hand seal.

In the next instant his body seemed to become a bottomless pit, ravenously devouring the surrounding Heaven-and-Earth Energy.

In a flash the once placid sea erupted into rolling waves and a fierce wind howled.

And with the disappearance of so much Heaven-and-Earth Energy, it felt as if something else over tens of thousands of li on the sea surface had vanished too — the change made the martial artists present uneasy, a faint heart-palpitation rising in them.

At the Sea Hall headquarters on a great island, the current Hall Master Sha Hu sat with many high-ranking Sea Hall figures discussing important matters, when he suddenly seemed to sense something. He looked toward where the middle-aged man hovered, his face turning grave.

"Hall Master, what is it?" the Second Hall Master below asked.

Sha Hu said nothing, but his expression grew heavier and heavier. After a long while he abruptly rose: "Someone is making trouble on the Wuyou Sea — come with me and see."

As he spoke his body shot out like a cannonball; the many experts in the hall exchanged glances and hurried after him.

Deep beneath the sea, pipes and flutes sounded and zithers resonated as many young Sea Race maidens sang and danced; inside the Sea God Palace it was a scene of revelry.

Suddenly the Sea God Palace, tens of thousands of li down in the depths, became turbulent as if struck by a violent earthquake. The Palace Lord Lie Kong, sitting at the head, suddenly turned pale and looked upward; two dazzling, mysterious lights shot from his eyes, briefly appearing and vanishing. In the next instant a blurred figure formed before him; though separated by tens of thousands of li it seemed to sense his gaze and merely sneered before ignoring Lie Kong.

Lie Kong was furious. His majestic voice thundered through the Sea God Palace: "Who dares run rampant on my Wuyou Sea? Come to the Sea God Palace and beg for forgiveness — I might spare your life!"

His voice crossed the spatial barrier and, using Sea Race secret arts, transmitted along the seawater toward where the middle-aged man hovered.

The man, who was crazily absorbing the surrounding Heaven-and-Earth Energy, snorted coldly and turned his glacial gaze toward Lie Kong: "Insignificant ants, you dare speak to me like that? Get up here!"

Saying so, he sliced a finger downward in a graceful, indifferent motion as if cutting through two wisps of breeze.

But that single finger contained unimaginable might; the seawater split like a mirror and extended down into the depths. From above it looked as if a huge chasm had opened on the Wuyou Sea, waves surging on both sides while the middle stretch remained a vacuum.

The Sea God Palace beneath the waves was suddenly exposed to the middle-aged man's sight.

"Ah?" Lie Kong's face changed drastically and he stood frozen.

He had only used his Sea Race secret art to spy on some of the man's physical features, yet he never imagined the other would so casually slash the Wuyou Sea in two.

Such a feat was horrifying, utterly beyond Lie Kong's imagination.

Void King Realm? Impossible — even a Void King Realm would not possess such power!

The Sea Race maidens screamed and fled in all directions, attempting to dive into the water for safety, but when their bodies touched the chasm's edge they were struck as if by a great blow and exploded into clouds of blood and mist, countless dead and injured.

The Sea Race experts below were aghast as they looked up; the figure standing in the air was like a god, impossible to gaze at directly.

"Didn't you hear me? Get up here! I won't repeat myself!" the middle-aged man said impatiently, snorting as he pointed a fingertip toward Lie Kong.

At that finger's approach Lie Kong broke out in a cold sweat. He found he could not summon a thought of resistance; the finger moved unhurriedly yet seemed to block every route of escape.

Spurt... Lie Kong spat a mouthful of blood and in the next moment felt an invisible force bind him and rapidly pull him upward.

"Palace Lord!" the Sea Race experts shouted below, but none dared act rashly.

Lie Kong was the Sea God Palace's strongest — if even he was taken down so easily, any attempt to save him would be suicide.

In an instant despair spread; no one knew where this middle-aged man had come from or what level of cultivation he possessed.

The only thing they knew was that he absolutely had the power to destroy the entire Dark Star.

In mere breaths Lie Kong was dragged for tens of thousands of li until he arrived at the middle-aged man's side.

"Kneel!" the middle-aged man murmured two words without even looking at him.

Lie Kong clearly hadn’t sensed any trace of power being used, yet those two words echoed in his mind like a great bell tolling, rumbling violently within him. It was as if a spell compelled him to obey—his knees went weak, and he nearly fell to his knees before the other party.

After a moment Lie Kong's eyes turned blood-red and he bellowed: "I am the Sea God Palace's Palace Lord — how can I kneel to you? If I do, what face would be left for my Sea God Palace?"

He tried desperately to muster his power; white vapor steamed from his hulking body, pressure cracking his skin, blood staining him.

The middle-aged man looked at him coldly and said lightly, "You don't have a choice in the matter."

"Even if I die, I won't let you have your way!" Lie Kong roared, veins bulging on his forehead, refusing to yield.

Crack... crack... explosive sounds suddenly came from beneath Lie Kong's legs, and with the sounds his legs shattered into powder from the knees down.

The intense pain only fueled Lie Kong's defiance; he gritted his teeth and bellowed through his misery, laughing: "My legs are gone — how will you make me kneel? In the next life!"

The middle-aged man frowned slightly, a trace of moved expression on his face. "Didn't expect you to have such will and backbone. Fine — I'll spare your life for now. I'll deal with you slowly later."

As he spoke he waved his hand and a bubble-like thing shot out, enveloping Lie Kong so that no matter how he struggled he could not escape.

Not far away Sha Hu and a group of Sea Hall experts had just arrived, but after seeing that horrifying scene each of them felt their hearts sink.

The Sea Hall folk knew Lie Kong's strength well; the two great forces had fought in the Wuyou Sea for so long they knew each other's foundations.

Lie Kong had been Sea Hall's number one enemy, the most troublesome opponent; even if Sha Hu personally struck, he had no confidence of killing Lie Kong on this sea.

Yet now, this leader of the Sea Race—the master of the Sea God Palace, a figure who once commanded the winds and tides, shaking heaven and earth—was rendered utterly pathetic before a strange middle-aged man. Not only did he have no strength to resist, but even his legs had been shattered.

Sha Hu and the others all felt sorrow at the sight.

"Retreat!" Sha Hu barked, sensing the danger and ordering a quick withdrawal.

If the other could so easily take down Lie Kong, he was not someone they could withstand.

"Since you're here, don't leave!" the middle-aged man sneered. "I only wanted to draw some of the world's Origin Power. If you behaved and stay put, I wouldn't trouble you, but since you're courting death, I won't stop you from taking a trip!"

As he spoke he palm-struck in the direction where Sha Hu and the others stood.

He seemed to be swatting a mosquito.

In that instant the Spiritual Qi converged into a massive palm imprint and slammed down.

A suffocating aura of death instantly spread in all directions. Sha Hu and the others turned pale as paper, faces drained of blood, all raising their heads to gaze at the enormous hand that blotted out the sky. Not a single one of them could even muster the thought of resistance.

What the hell was this guy? Sha Hu, facing death, still could not understand whence his power came — who could stand against him?

Dark Star had only just endured one calamity—was it about to face another?

At that moment Yang Kai's image flashed through Sha Hu's mind.

Perhaps... only that brat could handle this man. But the thought was dismissed by Sha Hu the instant it arose; Yang Kai was good, yes, but compared with the man before them there remained an unbridgeable gap.

The palm descended and some lower-powered Sea Hall martial artists exploded into pieces before touching it, dying on the spot.

Even someone like Sha Hu felt searing pain coursing through his entire body as sharp cracking sounds echoed from within—his bones shattering one after another.

"Disperse!" a low shout suddenly rang out.

Just a single word—yet it seemed to contain the essence of the Great Dao itself, carrying a power that made reality obey its command.

The Spiritual Qi went chaotic and the huge palm that had loomed over Sha Hu and the others scattered at that low command.

The sky cleared once more. Having narrowly escaped death, Sha Hu and the others greedily soaked in the sunlight, disbelief written all over their faces.

"Oh?" The middle-aged man's previously indifferent face finally showed interest as he turned toward the voice and then broke into a grin: "It's you — hahahah, I didn't look for you, yet you came to me. Fine, fine, you saved me a lot of trouble; I'll make your passing easy later!"

Yang Kai frowned, looking at the falling chunks of flesh and the wreckage of Lie Kong, his face solemn as he said, "Arrived a little late."

"Yang Kai!" Sha Hu cried out in joy and surprise.
