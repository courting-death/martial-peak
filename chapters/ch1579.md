## Chapter 1579 — Do Be Kind to Master Xia

Xia Ningshang was elevated in status; not only did she obtain her own private pavilion, but several young, beautiful, and nimble maidservants attended to her every need. All she had to do was focus on refining pills for Lady Chi Yue.

Everything unfolded exactly as Yang Kai had anticipated.

"Miss Xia, these materials were allocated to you by the Lady," a maid in green said inside the pavilion, handing a Spatial Ring to Xia Ningshang. "The Lady hopes to see finished spiritual pills in one month."

"Give them to me." Yang Kai smiled and took the Spatial Ring.

The green‑clad maid's dark brows twitched in slight displeasure; she did not openly refuse, but she placed the Spatial Ring into Yang Kai's hand with reluctance.

Yang Kai let his Divine Sense sweep through it, then let out a soft laugh. "Is that all the materials?"

"Isn't that enough? This is already material for forty Origin‑Grade pills," the maid said with a frown.

"Hmm, it's a bit little. Can we get more materials?" Yang Kai asked.

"We could, but… the other masters in the palace each receive about the same share per month. If they had more, they wouldn't have time to refine them."

"Those people can't compare to my Little Senior Sister!" Yang Kai curled his lip in disdain. "Get more materials — the more, the better."

The green‑clad maid looked at Xia Ningshang in embarrassment. Honestly, she disliked Yang Kai; the gossip that he was a pretty face who lived off women and roved from one to another had long spread through the palace.

No woman could harbor any fondness for a man like that.

He already had a woman who was a Pill Refining Grandmaster yet was still not content, and he had dared to cast his claws toward Lady Shan Qingluo. Pitifully, Lady Shan Qingluo seemed to be shrouded in some veil, unable to see through the scoundrel's nature or the filthy soul hidden beneath his luminous exterior.

In the palace, almost everyone sighed for Lady Shan Qingluo, thinking such a flower wasted if it chose to settle in dung; they were furious and heartbroken.

Now that Yang Kai spoke with the arrogance of the heavens, the already disliking green‑clad maid grew even more averse to him.

But the Lady seemed intent on employing this newly arrived Pills Grandmaster, so she couldn't outright refuse. She only wanted to ask Xia Ningshang's opinion.

"Follow Junior Brother's suggestion," Xia Ningshang said softly. "If the Lady asks, tell her it's what I want. She won't object."

"Yes!" the maid said helplessly and nodded.

"By the way, what is the usual success rate for those masters in the palace when they produce pills?" Yang Kai asked.

"Twenty percent!" the maid answered coldly. "Ten portions of material, two successes."

"Understood, thanks for telling me!" Yang Kai smiled and cupped his fist.

The maid looked at him earnestly, as if wanting to say something, but after hesitating she could not bring herself to speak. She only excused herself to Xia Ningshang and then left.

"That girl seems to hate me," Yang Kai watched her retreating back and chuckled; he knew why she wore such a loathing expression, yet he did not take it to heart.

"Junior Brother, isn't what we're doing a little improper?" Xia Ningshang asked anxiously, looking at Yang Kai.

"Improper how?"

"After all, these are Origin‑Grade materials. They are valuable. Doing this is tantamount to taking materials from Lady Chi Yue…" Xia Ningshang felt uneasy and guilty.

"That's not right," Yang Kai shook his head. "Little Senior Sister, think about it — that maid said the other palace masters have about a twenty percent success rate when refining Origin‑Grade pills. That means eighty percent of the materials are wasted by them. But you're different. If you refine with full effort, while it may not be a hundred percent success rate, you'll achieve eighty to ninety percent; occasional failures matter little. If you convert those materials into thirty percent finished pills for Lady Chi Yue, she profits hugely, and we merely reap some benefit. It's advantageous for everyone."

"What you say makes sense, but I still feel uneasy," Xia Ningshang murmured, pressing her lips together.

Although she felt like a thief in her heart, since Yang Kai wanted her to do it, Xia Ningshang would not refuse.

The two of them soon threw themselves into the great work of pill refining.

For Xia Ningshang, refining pills was a form of cultivation; it was an enjoyment rather than toil. Now that she had also reached the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm as a martial artist and had studied the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy, her achievement in alchemy was formidable.

Coupled with her previous success in Huiyue City where she had refined a spiritual pill that bore a Pill Cloud and the great gains and insights she reaped, Yang Kai himself admired her understanding of pill refining.

One batch after another of materials was turned into finished spiritual pills in her hands with astonishing efficiency.

Yang Kai wasn’t idle either. He was experimenting with the refining method described in the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy for the final stage of pill formation. If successful, a single batch of materials would yield multiple Spiritual Pills instead of just one.

It was easy to imagine how profoundly such a breakthrough would shock the domain of pill refining.

It would be a truly pioneering advancement.

Unfortunately, Yang Kai had no clear clue yet and could only refine pills while he studied the True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy.

The two seniors worked together, and forty portions of refining materials were exhausted in just a few days.

Several days later, when the green‑clad maid returned to collect a bottle containing twelve spiritual pills, she gaped in astonishment.

Only a few days had passed, yet the young and beautiful Pills Grandmaster had really refined all the materials? Moreover, the yield was a full ten percent higher than the other palace masters!

She could hardly believe her eyes.

If those pills did not correspond exactly to the materials previously delivered, she would have suspected Xia Ningshang of passing off previously refined pills as new ones.

No wonder the Lady valued her so highly — she truly had talent!

Thinking so, the maid found Yang Kai even more annoying; that pretty face was shamelessly thick‑skinned, doing nothing all day but lingering beside this young lady, never leaving her side as if afraid someone would steal her away.

But it wasn't entirely his fault — with no real talent of his own and living off women, he would naturally keep a close watch. A talent like Master Xia would have countless suitors.

"Master Xia, here are materials for a hundred Origin‑Grade pills. The Lady said if you need more, merely tell this maid and the palace will supply as much as you require unconditionally," the green‑clad maid respectfully handed over more materials.

"Thank you," Xia Ningshang smiled faintly.

"Just put them there," Yang Kai gestured indifferently.

The maid glared at him viciously, set down the materials, thought for a moment, then suddenly snapped, "Do be kind to Master Xia, you shameless man!"

She left in a huff.

Yang Kai looked baffled and frowned. "Why did she scold me? I didn't do anything to her!"

Xia Ningshang pursed her lips and smiled gently, comforting him. "Don't mind it. Others don't know how excellent you are; it's enough that I know."

Yang Kai's heart warmed.

Xia Ningshang lowered her head and said softly, "Actually, this is fine — I really fear more women would learn how outstanding you are."

"Since Little Senior Sister says so, I'll be content to be your pretty face," Yang Kai burst into loud laughter.

Xia Ningshang's face flushed; the term 'pretty face' always made her think of unpleasant and decadent things...

Red Moon Domain ranked among the top three territories of the Ten Territories of the Demon Star; its lands were naturally rich, producing abundant heaven‑and‑earth treasures. Moreover, since it was a yao star, countless demonic beasts roamed, so the palace lacked no alchemical herbs or demonic beasts' inner cores.

Whatever Xia Ningshang desired, the palace could provide.

To extract as much benefit as possible, Yang Kai and his Senior Sister worked tirelessly refining pills. They only used thirty percent of each batch of materials to produce pills and handed the produced pills to the green‑clad maid, then took fresh materials from her in exchange.

The remaining seventy percent they pocketed for themselves.

Chances to plunder refining materials on such a scale were rare; Yang Kai would not let it slip by.

He himself did not care much; he was already a Void King‑Grade Pill Refiner. Only if he used Void King‑Grade materials would his alchemical skill truly improve; otherwise refining more pills merely increased his familiarity.

But Xia Ningshang was different — she needed a vast base of materials to refine pills and raise her cultivation.

As a Star Lord of Tongxuan Continent, Little Senior Sister was eager to advance her realm in order to bring vitality back to her homeland.

The materials obtained from the palace would become stepping stones for Xia Ningshang's growth.

Xia Ningshang's excellence greatly pleased Lady Chi Yue.

Although the palace had several Origin‑Grade pill refiners, none were as efficient and rapid as Xia Ningshang. Truly, even combining all those Origin‑Grade masters together would not match the usefulness of one Xia Ningshang.

Lady Chi Yue believed that if Xia Ningshang served in the palace for ten years, she could likely cultivate hundreds of Origin Returning Realm martial artists for the domain!

This was no idle boast: given ten years, the pills Xia Ningshang refined, if given to capable yao martial artists, would certainly help them grow effectively.

She increasingly favored Xia Ningshang, granting almost every request without delay, and this indulgence further facilitated Yang Kai's pilfering of materials.

He was already considering whether to procure some Void King‑Grade materials from Lady Chi Yue.

On Di Chen Star, no Void King‑Grade pill refiner had ever appeared!

That meant the palace must surely store many Void King‑Grade herbs.

Yang Kai had already gleaned this by probing Shan Qingluo; he learned of a storeroom where many precious materials, including Void King‑Grade items, were kept — and his heart was greatly tempted.
