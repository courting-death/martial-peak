## Chapter 931 — Killing One to Ease My Vexation

Zhongdu—the city so vast its north and south cannot see each other, the number one city under heaven!

Seen from afar, the vast Zhongdu lay like a slumbering ancient beast, crouched upon the earth; its sweeping aura of desolation inspired both awe and reverence.

A streak of azure light halted in the air fifty li from Zhongdu, revealing the figures of Yang Kai, Li Rong, and Han Fei.

"There’s such a massive city here?" Li Rong blinked in astonishment and cried out.

Zhongdu’s scale was exceedingly rare even on the Tongxuan Continent; Li Rong could hardly imagine how many years the natives had spent to raise so enormous a metropolis.

"But it looks like there are traces of destruction," Han Fei frowned.

"Yes. Over ten years ago the Earth Vein beneath Zhongdu erupted and the city was devastated. When I left, everyone was rebuilding Zhongdu; though more than a decade has passed, it still doesn’t look fully restored," Yang Kai said with a slight nod.

At this moment Zhongdu seemed strangely calm; despite being fifty li away, Yang Kai could still make out the movements of many people within the city.

Suddenly, specks of light flared from a corner of Zhongdu, catching Yang Kai’s eye.

"Master, there seems to be a fight over there," Li Rong said in a low voice.

"Let’s go see!" Yang Kai once again guided the Flying Shuttle and they vanished from where they hovered.

At Zhongdu’s southern gate, a group of Transcendent Realm warriors wore savage expressions as they fled in panic.

That southern gate was the Yang Family’s private entrance; whenever direct-line Yang family members returned, they passed through this gate. Yang Kai himself had used this route years ago when he returned to Zhongdu for the Succession War.

The Transcendent Realm fighters fleeing now were almost all elite members of the Yang Family’s Blood Servants Hall.

They ran with all their might, aiming to flee Zhongdu.

But behind them stalked two enemies they could not possibly match.

"You scum run fast enough. I wonder where you’ll flee to now!" One of them, a middle-aged man with a single eye, taunted leisurely as he trailed them, not striking immediately. His gaze brimmed with derision, feline and amused. "A mere bunch of Transcendents—daring to act insolently before me. Run all you like, just don’t get caught, or you’ll regret it."

The hunted all glared with eyes bloodshot; yet every one of them knew their foe’s might and dared not stop to fight, instead throwing out martial techniques as they fled to slow their pursuer.

Those martial skills struck the one-eyed man and accomplished nothing. Ripples alone spread across his body; attacks sank like stones in a vast sea, leaving no trace.

The fleeing Transcendents felt utterly despondent.

"Qiu Xu, stop playing around. Sect Master Wu is waiting for our report; capture them quickly," a voluptuous woman called out, pulling the one-eyed man’s attention.

Qiu Xu cast a glance at her and snorted, "No need for your reminder."

He muttered under his breath, "Bitch. She thinks that clinging to Wu Zheng gives her the right to boss me around—what a joke."

His expression turned savage as he shouted down, "Run! If any of you is the first I catch, I’ll make you endure every torture known to man until death seems a mercy! You’re of some use, so you’ll serve me—yet you dare try to run? Foolish!"

Hearing the pair’s voices, those below grew even paler.

Amid the crowd a burly man growled, "Brothers and sisters, scatter! Let fate decide life or death. If anyone escapes, live and find the Young Master—tell him what happened here!"

The others nodded in agreement and shouted in unison, "Good luck!"

In the next instant they scattered in all directions.

The man and woman in pursuit showed no surprise. The one-eyed Qiu Xu sneered, "So you’ve still got some sense. I thought you’d stop and fight me; you’re not as stupid as I expected."

"Don’t mess around—if they run too far it’s a pain. You cut them off, I’ll block the rear!" the voluptuous woman ordered, unleashing a surge of power. An invisible barrier appeared behind the Transcendents, sealing their retreat, and then advanced forward rapidly, shrinking their space.

Seeing her move, Qiu Xu wasted no words and used the same method to sever the front path of those warriors.

Boom, boom, boom…

Figures struck the invisible barrier, ripples forming in midair as those fighters were stunned and driven back in disarray, faces twisted in anger.

Two swordlike auras struck from front and rear, forcing them to huddle together back-to-back, looking up and angrily facing the male and female in the sky.

With heaven and earth blocked, under overwhelming force they were at their enemies’ mercy and could not resist.

"Xiu Li, I’ll kill one of them just to vent—got no problem with that, right?" Qiu Xu asked the voluptuous woman, peering at her with his lone eye.

Xiu Li frowned and said disapprovingly, "Their strength isn’t high. What good does killing them do? Sect Master Wu keeps them alive so they can be subdued and put to work. If they submit, the rest will be easy. The area’s Spiritual Qi is weak and resources thin, but there are many people; bring them over to mine and mine a bit—some hard labor would suffice."

“Of course I understand Cult Master Wu’s intentions, but… unless I crush their arrogance, I cannot ease the hatred in my heart.” Qiu Xu slowly shook his head.

Seeing his attitude, Xiu Li grew disgusted but didn’t want to argue. She reluctantly agreed, "Fine—but only one. If you kill more, I’ll report you to Sect Master Wu."

"I know you’re close to Sect Master Wu, but don’t use him to pressure me. I’m still the Pavilion Master of Wentian Pavilion, he’s got no right to boss me," Qiu Xu retorted.

"Then get on with it—no more words," Xiu Li snapped impatiently.

Qiu Xu sneered and scanned the fleeing dozen or so Transcendents, ignoring their glaring looks. He pointed at one woman and said, "She’ll do. I love killing women—especially pretty ones!"

He glanced at Xiu Li with that remark; she snorted, aware of his meaning, and ignored him.

The woman he singled out went deathly pale.

"Yuxian..." the others cried out in shock.

Tang Yuxian smiled with resigned sorrow. "Let fate decide life or death. Don’t resist. Go to where the Young Master went and do everything to find him—make him avenge me and my fallen brothers and sisters!"

Everyone shook their heads.

"Woman, any last words? You’ve got ten breaths," Qiu Xu raged as he hovered in the air and laughed wildly.

“They’ve gone too far—I’ll fight them to the death!” Tu Feng roared in fury, his blood energy surging madly upward. It was clear he was about to unleash the Blood Servants’ secret art, the Blood Fury Technique.

"If we’re to die, we’ll die together. We won’t stand by and watch you be killed," Ying Jiu said, his form flickering as his Shadow Dance Kill readied.

At that moment an invisible pressure descended and froze everyone in place; Tu Feng’s Blood Fury Technique was suppressed mid-release, and Ying Jiu’s shifting form stiffened instantly.

Qiu Xu laughed. "You’re overestimating yourselves. How can Transcendents contend with Saint Realm cultivators? Now you’ll see the gulf between us. Killing you would be as easy as crushing ants."

He stretched out a large hand and clenched at the void.

Tang Yuxian cried out, discovering she was being bound by an invisible force and began to slowly float upward.

After a moment she hung some ten zhang above the ground.

The invisible power constricting her only tightened; Tang Yuxian struggled for breath, her face flushing red as she tried to resist but could produce no force.

Screams rose from below, sharp and heart-rending.

Cracking sounds issued from Tang Yuxian’s body as if her bones were being crushed.

Facing death, Tang Yuxian remained calm, staring coldly at Qiu Xu. Her eyes’ resolute acceptance of death briefly stunned him.

Whoosh...

A swordlike flash suddenly shot through the void, slicing between Qiu Xu and Tang Yuxian.

A sound of something being cut rang out.

Tang Yuxian, freed from her bonds, gasped as the immense pressure vanished and she plummeted back down.

Three ghostly figures draped in bone-chilling cold appeared midair, blue light flashing.

"Who are you?" Qiu Xu and Xiu Li’s faces changed and they shouted.

The Transcendents below turned their gazes toward the newcomers.

Their expressions went blank.

In the next instant joyful cries rang out.

"Young Master!"

Yang Kai gave a slight nod and looked below.

Familiar faces flashed through his mind.

Tu Feng, Tang Yuxian, Ying Jiu, Ji Li, Xiao Shun, Yan Lingxing, Wu Ju...

Most of the Yang Family Blood Servants Hall’s fighters were here.

"Yuxian, are you alright?" Yang Kai asked gravely.

Tang Yuxian’s eyes brimmed with emotion as she kept nodding. "Just a few minor injuries. Don’t worry, Young Master."

"Good." Yang Kai quietly breathed.

"Who are you?" Qiu Xu frowned and stood together with Xiu Li as they demanded angrily.
