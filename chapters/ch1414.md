## Chapter 1414 — I'll Consider It

Although the woman surnamed Ye’s reputation and strength made people wary, she was still only one person; with so many experts here cooperating, how could she possibly hold them back?

Only Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu stood in place with dark brows, remaining motionless. Given their connections with Dragon Lair Mountain, they naturally wouldn’t pick a fight with the woman surnamed Ye; what worried them more was how things were going over on Yang Kai’s side.

Besides them, two other contingents had yet to move: one led by Qiantian Sect’s Great Elder Mo Yu and the others from Qiantian Sect, and the other a group of women headed by Liuli Sect’s elder Gong Aofu.

The former seemed lost in thought, smiling faintly as they watched toward the interior of Dragon Lair Mountain, as if savoring a good show and deciding to remain bystanders.

The latter truly wanted to break into Dragon Lair Mountain, but Gong Aofu was only a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator, her strength somewhat inferior; seeing the woman surnamed Ye unleash her dominance, she could do nothing but stand there with a worried expression, unable to help.

Apart from these people, the rest—regardless of cultivation level—were nearly all desperately pushing into Dragon Lair Mountain. Most did not seek to make the woman surnamed Ye their enemy; they were simply too curious about the secret hidden after that pillar of light shot down. Taking advantage of the moment the woman surnamed Ye was besieged by multiple Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts, they each tried to find a way around the battlefield to rush into the mountain.

Seeing the situation spiraling out of control, Ge Qi, Chang Qi, Hao An, and Ning Xiangchen naturally sprang into action and unleashed their own Secret Treasures to block them.

All manner of Saint Yuan flashed and surged; in an instant a titanic mêlée broke out before the Protective Mountain Array of Dragon Lair Mountain.

The fight began and ended in a rush. With so many opponents, the woman surnamed Ye and the other four Origin Returning Realm cultivators simply couldn’t stop everyone. Seizing the chance while the woman surnamed Ye was entangled, Mo Xiaosheng once again unleashed his abstruse spatial force, his figure blurring on the spot.

This time the woman surnamed Ye truly could not stop him and could only watch helplessly as he vanished from sight and charged into Dragon Lair Mountain.

“Damn it!” the woman surnamed Ye ground her silver teeth. In a momentary lapse more Origin Returning Realm experts slipped through the net and shook off her entanglement, their figures flickering as they rushed deeper into the mountain.

A deep helplessness surged in the woman surnamed Ye’s heart. If she were a Void King Realm cultivator, stopping this crowd would be no trouble at all, but she was merely a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator, though one foot had already stepped into the Void King Realm. Under the suppressing law of the Dark Star’s realm she couldn’t break through that final barrier, and her effective strength was greatly diminished.

Continuing to tangle was pointless. The woman surnamed Ye motioned and took the Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp into her palm. With a flick of her body she wrapped Yang Yan up and followed the others into the mountain.

With her gone, the others were unwilling to be left behind and hurried after her.

Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu exchanged looks, both frowning with worry; they sighed helplessly and followed in as well.

On Qiantian Sect’s side, Mo Yu thought for a moment and said, “You all stay outside; I’ll go in and take a look.”

Judging by the scene, a great battle might break out; Mo Yu would not recklessly let his disciples enter such danger.

“Master!” Shen Shitao suddenly called out.

Mo Yu glanced at her and smiled kindly, “Speak.”

Shen Shitao gently bit her lip, uneasy, and said, “Junior Brother Yang saved both me and Junior Sister Lü Ying’s lives. If possible, Master… please take care of him!”

She had mustered her courage to say it. After all, Mo Yu was her master and she had no right to demand anything of him. Besides, the matter was exceedingly complicated—if he intervened he might be inviting disaster. She had prepared herself to be scolded by her master when she spoke.

Unexpectedly Mo Yu only pondered briefly and then readily nodded, “Very well, I will do my best, though don’t expect too much—this time… hehe.”

Mo Yu didn’t finish his sentence, but everyone knew what he meant: he clearly felt the situation inside Dragon Lair Mountain was somewhat dire.

Shen Shitao and Lü Ying were overjoyed, thanking him profusely and bowing deeply. When they stood up Mo Yu was already gone. The two exchanged glances and breathed out; they never imagined their master would be so agreeable.

Whatever the final result, they had done their part by summoning the courage to plead for Yang Kai’s aid before Mo Yu.

Meanwhile Gong Aofu likewise instructed Yin Sudie and Daiyuan to remain outside and wait; she then ventured alone into Dragon Lair Mountain.

The path in was unobstructed, but Gong Aofu could still sense that the mountain had originally been riddled with restrictions and formations—only now they had been destroyed.

So many had stormed in earlier that no matter how many restrictions and formations remained, they could no longer stop the intruders. Moreover, there was no one inside Dragon Lair Mountain to preside over the formations, so their power couldn’t be fully exerted.

Gong Aofu’s heart tightened. Before long she arrived at a place inside Dragon Lair Mountain where a great number of Origin Returning Realm experts had gathered, many of them Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, arrayed in a semicircle around a vast area whose center was precisely where the pillar of light from the Imperial Garden had descended.

At that moment a young man stood there with an arrogant bearing and an indifferent expression—he was the master of Dragon Lair Mountain, the Saint King Realm Third Stage cultivator Yang Kai.

Gong Aofu glanced at him and was immediately drawn to an object in his hand: a square jade token about half a palm across, flawless and pure, with a faint red flow of light within like a fish swimming in water—utterly wondrous.

With Gong Aofu’s eyesight she could not at first discern the jade’s material, only that a peculiar power radiated from it.

Countless greedy, curious gazes fixated on that jade token.

Could this be something that fell from the Imperial Garden? Gong Aofu’s quick mind immediately considered that possibility.

When the pillar of light had shot down from the Imperial Garden and vanished, something was clearly left behind, and Yang Kai had been the first to arrive. If there was any discovery to be had, it would undoubtedly be that jade token—otherwise why would everyone be so covetous?

Gong Aofu’s guess was correct. With the woman surnamed Ye holding off others, Yang Kai had indeed only found this jade token when he arrived, but before he had much time to study it Mo Xiaosheng had already broken through the woman surnamed Ye’s obstruction and reached the spot.

It was not that the woman surnamed Ye was incompetent—two hands could not hold back four. She might have defeated Mo Xiaosheng in a direct fight, but preventing his departure was another matter, for the man cultivated spatial force and his movement was unmatched in its strangeness.

The situation instantaneously became an awkward scene of the gathered strong watching one another, yet Yang Kai remained unperturbed and serene.

He had no other option: if driven to desperation he could endure some risk and simply tear through space to flee. Though many enemies surrounded him, he still had a fifty percent chance of escaping safely.

With such confidence he naturally showed no fear, and moreover the woman surnamed Ye stood on his side—he was not without a chance.

“Young brother…” the silent, tranquil air was broken by Mo Xiaosheng, whose eyes glittered as he fixed on the jade token in Yang Kai’s hand, his tone as calm as he could make it, “May I have a look at the jade in your hand?”

Whatever that jade was, since it came from the Imperial Garden it must have something to do with the Starry Sky Emperor. Anything connected to the Emperor would hardly be of little value.

Mo Xiaosheng was not alone in wanting a closer look; others felt the same, though he was the first to voice it.

“Let you take a look?” Yang Kai grinned mockingly. “Wouldn’t that be like throwing a meat bun at a dog—gone for good and never coming back?”

He harbored no goodwill toward the Battle Sky Alliance, so he spoke without courtesy.

Mo Xiaosheng’s expression darkened in an instant and he said coldly, “Boy, watch your mouth. I only wish to see it—do you think I, given my identity and status, would covet something from a junior?”

“Isn’t that exactly what you’re doing?” Yang Kai curled his lip. “If not, then why did you chase me all the way here?”

Saying that, Yang Kai slipped the jade token into his Spatial Ring.

Many cultivators’ faces turned ugly. A treasure goes to the capable, and though the strange treasure that fell from the Imperial Garden had landed in Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai had been the first to seize it. Yet he was only a Saint King Realm Third Stage cultivator—what right did he have to possess such an item?

Worse, he openly placed the jade into his Spatial Ring before everyone’s eyes, clearly showing contempt for them and making them furious.

In another place they might not hesitate to kill for the treasure—this happened often enough—but this was Dragon Lair Mountain, and the presence of the woman surnamed Ye made them somewhat restrained.

Especially after witnessing the might of her Bone‑Eroding Severing Flame Lamp.

“Young brother, if you hand the jade to me I’ll offer one hundred million Saint Crystals!” Compared to Mo Xiaosheng’s hypocrisy, Cheng Pengxuan of Leitai Sect was far more straightforward. Knowing he couldn’t obtain it for free, he immediately attempted to buy it with a high price.

In his mind one hundred million Saint Crystals was an astronomical sum for Dragon Lair Mountain; the young man might never see so much wealth in his life. If Yang Kai were clever enough to know that holding the jade was like grasping a hot coal, he would not refuse.

“One hundred million…” Yang Kai’s brows rose as if tempted. He pondered for a moment and said, “Hmm, I’ll consider it.”

Cheng Pengxuan brightened and asked, “Then how long will you need to make up your mind?”

The longer the delay the more chance for something to go wrong, so he wanted it settled quickly.

“Perhaps ten days or half a month, perhaps three to five years—who can say? This is a grave matter and I must consider it carefully. Elder Cheng, you can return to Leitai Sect and await my news.”
