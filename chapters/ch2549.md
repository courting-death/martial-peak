## Chapter 2549 — Can't Hold On

Although the group from the Netherworld Sect felt disgruntled at being ordered around by Lin'er, at this point, they had no way out.

Besides, they had come here for the sole purpose of killing Yang Kai.

"Go!" Yin Lesheng suddenly waved his hand, shouting loudly.

Swish, swish, swish...

More than twenty Netherworld Sect disciples shot forward together, their figures flickering as they instantly surrounded Yang Kai from all directions—above, below, left, right, front, and back—leaving him no escape at all.

Yin Lesheng watched nervously, afraid Yang Kai would use his space abilities to escape at this moment.

If Yang Kai sensed danger and fled, all their efforts would be wasted. The grand formation wasn't set up yet, the space wasn't sealed, and there would be no way to kill or capture Yang Kai.

But to his delight, Yang Kai seemed completely unconcerned about the twenty-plus Netherworld Sect disciples, still standing there quietly as if no one else existed.

Serves you right for being so arrogant. Do you think that just because you've advanced to the Emperor Realm and have space abilities, you're invincible? Today, you'll learn there are always higher mountains and stronger people.

Yin Lesheng was secretly pleased, though he kept a calm expression, locking his Divine Sense tightly onto Yang Kai.

In just the blink of an eye, the twenty-plus Netherworld Sect disciples had taken their positions.

Clatter...

After a series of sounds, the group each summoned their Secret Treasures. All their Secret Treasures were identical, as if forged by the same person—large, pitch-black banners that fluttered in the wind, emitting a chilling aura.

These banners were exactly the same as the Netherworld Infernal Banner Yang Kai had obtained from Zhong Zhenyong in the Shattered Star Sea. Clearly, they were the same type of Secret Treasure, seemingly favored by the Netherworld Sect disciples.

However, the power fluctuations from the Netherworld Infernal Banners in these disciples' hands seemed weaker than Zhong Zhenyong's, likely because they hadn't fully refined them yet.

With everyone in position and the banners summoned, everything was ready—just waiting for the final push!

Yin Lesheng's lips curled into a sinister smile. He shouted again, "Form the array!"

The twenty-plus Netherworld Sect disciples responded in low voices, their hands weaving seals. Instantly, a subtle connection formed among them, an invisible restrictive force linking them together and sealing the world. Faint black mist began to spread from the Netherworld Infernal Banners toward the center.

"Form the array?" Yang Kai seemed startled, his face flustered as he asked, "What array?"

Yin Lesheng laughed wildly, boasting, "Naturally, it's a grand array meant to take your life!"

At this point, he had nothing left to worry about. The Heaven Net Sealing Array was already set. Space was locked down. Even with mastery over space, Yang Kai couldn't escape unless he could break the array itself.

But with more than twenty Dao Origin Realm disciples using Netherworld Infernal Banners to set up the Heaven Net Sealing Array, how could a First Stage Emperor break it?

Even a Third Stage Emperor would be trapped for a while.

Yang Kai looked utterly terrified, his face pale as he stared at Yin Lesheng, swallowing hard. "Brother Yin, what grudge do you have against me to treat me like this? In the Shattered Star Sea, I let you go once. Don't you remember any old favors?"

Yin Lesheng felt satisfied, snorting coldly, "Let me go? Don't make it sound so nice. If I hadn't had the information you wanted, would you have let me go? What old favors do we have, Yang Kai? Enough talk—today, this is your burial ground."

Yang Kai cried out in anguish, "Brother Yin, do you really have to kill me?"

Yin Lesheng raised his head, sneering, "What? You still hope to survive at this point?"

Yang Kai grinned, "Who wants to die if they can live? Brother Yin, why not let me go today, and I'll come thank you another day?"

"Do you take me for a three-year-old? You actually dare say that?"

Yang Kai sighed helplessly, "Looks like Brother Yin is set on killing me. Nothing I say will change your mind?"

Yin Lesheng shouted, "No matter how eloquent you are, no one will listen."

Yang Kai couldn't help but sigh, running his hands through his hair and pulling it back, looking desolate. "Brother Yin, I have one last request!"

"Hmph, what else do you want to say?" Yin Lesheng sneered, feeling extremely pleased. For some reason, seeing Yang Kai so desperate made him feel as if he'd just ravaged dozens of maidens—his pleasure was almost uncontrollable.

"Please, let me die in the most handsome pose!" Yang Kai turned his face to the side, gazing at the sky from a tilted angle, hands clasped behind his back, striking a pose so dashing it was almost comical.

Lin'er twitched her lips and whispered to Elder Fu, "This guy is really vain."

Elder Fu was at a loss for words.

Suddenly, Yin Lesheng's brows furrowed as he shouted, "You're playing me!"

In that instant, he realized Yang Kai hadn't been talking so much out of fear or because he was about to die, but was clearly just toying with him.

Yang Kai burst out laughing, "Just having some fun, Brother Yin. Why take it so seriously? Did you really think I was afraid of you?"

His mischievous expression made Yin Lesheng so angry he nearly spat blood.

As he finished speaking, the Laws of Space surged, and Yang Kai's figure suddenly blurred.

But soon, his body solidified again, reappearing in the same spot without moving at all.

"The Heaven Net Sealing Array really lives up to its name!" Yang Kai raised his brows. Although he'd heard Qi Hefeng mention the array's power and knew it could seal the world, he still wanted to test if he could escape.

Now that he'd tried, he found the surrounding space truly isolated. Even with his mastery of space, he couldn't teleport away.

"Attack now!" Yin Lesheng shouted, afraid that if they delayed, Yang Kai would escape.

The twenty-plus Netherworld Sect disciples responded, channeling Origin Qi into their Netherworld Infernal Banners and fiercely activating the array's power.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

A chorus of ghostly wails and wolfish howls echoed out, making it feel as if the world had suddenly plunged into a haunted nether realm. An icy chill swept across the land, turning the earth into frozen tundra. All around, trees, flowers, and grass withered instantly, crumbling into ash and drifting away on the wind.

From the twenty-plus Netherworld Infernal Banners, thick black mist poured out, within which countless Yin-Soul ghosts churned and clawed, terrifying to behold.

In just three breaths, the world sealed by the Heaven Net Sealing Array was plunged into darkness. From afar, it looked as if a giant black sphere had appeared in the world.

The sphere was dozens of zhang in diameter, covering a vast area and completely hiding Yang Kai's figure within.

The array’s power had only just begun to reveal itself, yet it was already so terrifying. If it were fully unleashed, its might would surely be even greater.

Yin Lesheng's lips twisted into a sinister smile as he stared at the giant black sphere, seemingly wanting to witness Yang Kai's death with his own eyes.

If Yang Kai had even a sliver of hope to escape before, now that the array’s true power was revealed, all chances of survival had vanished. Enshrouded by the formation, his life force was steadily slipping away. Not only that, but the twenty-plus Netherworld Infernal Banners, empowered by the array, grew far more formidable. With so many Netherworld Sect disciples attacking in unison, even if they had to grind him down, Yang Kai would surely meet his end.

"Yin Lesheng, you've schemed so much just to take my life. Do you really think I can't break this array?"

From within the black sphere, Yang Kai's powerful shout rang out, full of energy, seemingly unaffected by the array.

Yin Lesheng's eyes narrowed, suddenly feeling a sense of foreboding.

Before he could respond, a terrifying surge of power erupted from within the sphere, followed by a deafening explosion.

The already massive black sphere suddenly expanded under the force, looking as if it might burst at any moment.

The twenty-plus Dao Origin Realm disciples maintaining the Heaven Net Sealing Array all turned pale, their bodies trembling violently, nearly suffering backlash from the formation.

Yin Lesheng was shocked, his eyes nearly popping out.

Hua Feichen exclaimed in horror, "How is this possible? Didn't he just advance to the Emperor Realm?"

Although the array blocked his view, it was clear Yang Kai had unleashed a powerful secret technique to affect the array so much.

How could someone who just advanced to the Emperor Realm do this?

Hua Feichen thought to himself that if he were trapped inside, he'd be doomed, unable to shake the array at all.

What he saw before him was simply unreal!

Boom...

Another loud explosion, and the black sphere expanded again, even more than before.

Ugh...

With a series of sounds, half of the Dao Origin Realm disciples spat blood, their bodies swaying.

Yang Kai's first strike had already shaken them, and before they could recover, he struck again. This time, they were truly injured. Though the wounds weren't serious and didn't affect the array's operation, who knew how many more times Yang Kai could attack like that?

If he did it a few more times, the array might really be broken.

"Senior Uncle Hua, Senior Brother Yin, we can't hold on!" someone shouted.

Yin Lesheng was stunned. He'd brought so many people from the sect, even invited the Second Stage Emperor Hua Feichen, and set up the Heaven Net Sealing Array. If he still couldn't kill Yang Kai, how could he face the Netherworld Sect or his master?

If this failed, it would be worse than death for him.

Boom...

The third explosion sounded.

Pfft, pfft, pfft...

The twenty-plus Netherworld Sect disciples all spat blood, their faces pale, and the giant black sphere split open at one spot, thick black mist pouring out.

Yin Lesheng stared blankly.

The array... was really about to collapse.

And it had only been five breaths since Yang Kai made his move!
