## Chapter 507 — Never Regret

Over a hundred members of Lingxiao Pavilion, led by Yang Kai, were rapidly making their way toward War City.

When they had come here, Yang Kai and Ying Jiu had taken less than two days, including the time spent locating their companions. But now, returning took Yang Kai an estimated four to five days at the very least. The cultivation levels among his fellow senior brothers and disciples were uneven—while many had ascended to the True Yuan Realm, quite a few still lingered in the Separation and Union Realm and Qi Movement Realm.

Yang Kai was not in a hurry. Walking ahead, he chatted and laughed casually with Su Yan, enjoying this untroubled, light-hearted moment.

More than a year had passed since they last met, yet the bond between them had not weakened; on the contrary, it had grown even stronger.

Walking side by side with her, Yang Kai could even sense their True Yuan energies mingling in a strange and exquisite fusion. Sometimes, when one thought of something, the other seemed to faintly discern it. The sensation was truly rare.

One mind, one heart—they were near perfect harmony.

At this moment, they were nearly two thousand li away from War City.

A large group lurked silently in the dense grass, waiting.

At the forefront was Qiu Ziru of the Qiu Family from Zhongdu, a younger half-brother to Qiu Yimeng. Qiu Ziru had originally been an ally of Yang Shen—the Sixth Brother of the Yang Family. But on the night Yang Shen’s mansion was ambushed by Yang Kai, and the command flag was seized, forcing Yang Shen out of the picture, his forces were transferred to Yang Ying, the Seventh Brother, and Qiu Ziru followed him.

After a few days, Yang Ying voluntarily relinquished his claim, and his warriors gathered at Yang Zhao’s residence.

By now, Qiu Ziru had switched alliances three times, left frustrated and burdened. Though forced by circumstance, this meant a loss of face for him. His judgment in choosing which Yang Family son to follow was clearly flawed—whichever he backed, that son was eliminated.

Before the Succession War began, he had discussed its prospects with Qiu Yimeng and the Qiu Family Head, Qiu Shoucheng. Qiu Yimeng supported Yang Kai, even temporarily leaving the family to lead the remnant forces of Autumn Rain Hall to join him.

The results spoke for themselves: Qiu Yimeng had chosen a worthy ally.

Qiu Ziru and Qiu Shoucheng had pinned their hopes on Yang Shen, who ultimately did not hold out.

Now, Qiu Ziru was angered and determined to assist Yang Zhao in winning the Succession War, solidifying his own position as heir to the family.

Beside Qiu Ziru was Kang Zhan of the Kang Family, also from Zhongdu.

Both men were sons of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu and future leaders of those houses.

To deal with Yang Kai, the involvement of the Eight Great Families was essential. Hence, Yang Zhao had sent these two forth.

Yang Zhao himself must remain in War City; if he left, he risked suffering the same fate as Yang Shen.

Alongside Kang Zhan and Qiu Ziru were Xiang Chu of the Xiang Family and Nan Sheng of the Nan Family. These two families had countless grievances with Yang Kai. When they learned of the planned expedition against him, they volunteered eagerly to avenge their past humiliations.

Yang Zhao readily consented.

In addition, three or four other potent forces had converged here.

“Brother Kang, is the Second Young Master's information reliable? Yang Kai wouldn’t act so rashly, would he?” After more than a day with no movement, Qiu Ziru couldn’t help but lose patience.

Kang Zhan chuckled lightly, replying, “Brother Qiu, just be patient. If the Second Young Master says so, then it must be true.”

Qiu Ziru shot Kang Zhan a questioning glance. “You seem to hold the Second Young Master in high regard.”

Kang Zhan smiled coldly, “Don’t laugh, Brother Qiu. At the beginning of the Succession War, I wanted to ally with the Second Young Master because I think a man with his skills can achieve great things.”

“Oh? Then why ally with the Seventh Young Master?” Qiu Ziru raised an eyebrow in puzzlement; Kang Zhan had initially been allied with Yang Ying, but after Yang Ying’s withdrawal, Kang shifted his loyalty to Yang Zhao.

“No choice,” Kang Zhan sighed wryly, “the Second Young Master chose Ye Xinrou from the Ye Family, so I had to find someone else.”

An understanding and slightly suggestive look flashed across Qiu Ziru’s eyes as he nodded. “Beauty does hold some advantages.”

“Indeed. Men love beautiful women, especially someone as delicate and tender as Ye Xinrou,” Kang Zhan licked his lips.

Qiu Ziru also laughed softly. As peers from the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu, they both knew Ye Xinrou’s character and background well and were aware her relationship with Yang Zhao was quite special.

Because of this, Ye Xinrou held a prominent position within Yang Zhao’s household, and despite Qiu Ziru and Kang Zhan’s statuses as new allies to Yang Zhao, they could not match hers.

Still, they were unbothered, for their own standing remained considerable.

“This intelligence was reportedly gathered personally by that woman when she went to Zhongdu,” Kang Zhan said with a lewd smile. “The Ye Family’s eldest miss personally investigating—how could she fail? A little bribery and some favors, and she’d have them wrapped around her finger.”

“That’s true,” Qiu Ziru nodded, wondering if he himself could have kept secrets if seduced by Ye Xinrou, especially when his life hung in the balance.

“No matter how clever Yang Kai is, he wouldn’t suspect that the Second Young Master could infer his departure from War City from the slightest clue,” Kang Zhan said with a quiet chuckle. “He thinks his plans are flawless, but they still have cracks.”

“No one is perfect,” Qiu Ziru shook his head slightly. “He’s about our age. If he were flawless, what hope would we have?”

“Indeed.” Kang Zhan nodded. Despite their words, they could only acknowledge Yang Kai’s impressive skills. Without the Second Young Master’s meticulousness, they might have missed this rare opportunity.

“Young Master Xiang, Young Master Nan, Ying Jiu close to Yang Kai must be restrained by your families’ experts,” Kang Zhan turned to Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng.

Xiang Chu nodded lightly, replying calmly, “It is our duty.”

Nan Sheng’s face darkened with cruelty as he rubbed his severed finger. “Our two families are deploying two Divine Roaming Realm peak experts this time precisely to restrain that Ying Jiu. If I can avenge my lost finger, the entire Nan Family will obey you two wholeheartedly!”

Kang Zhan glanced at him and nodded slightly before saying no more.

Yang Kai’s household had a devil-level Divine Roaming Realm peak practitioner, and it was because of the threat posed by this villainous expert that Yang Zhao had each of the Xiang and Nan families dispatch a Divine Roaming Realm peak master to assist.

Such experts were seldom seen in the Succession War. After all, first-rate forces had very few at the Divine Roaming Realm peak, and losing one in the Succession War would be a grievous loss.

But Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng clearly hated Yang Kai with venomous passion and agreed to Yang Zhao’s request without hesitation.

Those two masters had been at Yang Zhao’s residence for only about a month, originally as a precaution to counter the devilish expert close to Yang Kai, but unexpectedly they would be called into action so soon.

Though Ying Jiu was a Blood Servant of the Yang Family with power reaching the eighth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, the two peak Divine Roaming Realm experts should be enough to restrain him.

All involved held great confidence for this battle.

No one anticipated that Ying Jiu had already reached the domain of a Divine Roaming Realm peak expert.

More and more scouts were sent to observe the surroundings, and everyone held their breath, concealing their own presence as they quietly waited.

After a day, news arrived: about a hundred were approaching, and in roughly half an hour they would reach this place.

Kang Zhan’s expression shifted, and he shouted, “Everyone, victory or defeat hinges on this battle. If we can eliminate Yang Kai here, the Second Young Master will surely view us differently. Show me your utmost skills; do not underestimate the enemy!”

Everyone nodded in unison.

“An ambush?” Qiu Ziru’s expression lit up, asking eagerly.

Kang Zhan glanced at him and frowned slightly, shaking his head. “Our scouts spotted them, so surely they have seen us too. No chance for an ambush.”

“Then we fight openly! I will make Yang Kai regret crossing me, Nan Sheng!” Nan Sheng gritted his teeth, his True Yuan fluctuating fiercely.

“Right! Let’s fight openly! After today, the Succession War will no longer have Yang Kai!” Kang Zhan shouted, “Move out!”

Thirty li away, Yang Kai’s expression darkened as he pondered where he had gone wrong.

Yang Zhao had deduced his movements merely from some actions of Bamboo Segment Gang’s leader Pang Chi—something Yang Kai could never have foreseen.

Just then, when he noticed a figure observing them from afar, he immediately sensed something amiss.

For their opponent to know exactly where to block their return path, they must have known his destination. Pang Chi could not have betrayed him; he was probably still detained by Qiu Yimeng, who herself would not leak information.

That left only the others in Bamboo Segment Gang.

In an instant, Yang Kai’s conclusion formed.

Looks like he would need to deal with this thoroughly upon returning.

Nevertheless, even in this, Yang Kai held no regrets. If given the choice again, he would still come out to welcome Lingxiao Pavilion.

All just to see Su Yan a day sooner!

Sensing Yang Kai’s change in mood, Su Yan asked softly, “What’s wrong?”

Yang Kai smiled faintly, shaking his head. “Nothing, just that someone may be blocking our way ahead.”

Su Yan’s face immediately darkened.

Last time, she and Yang Kai had planned to travel the world together, but Qiu Yimeng interfered. Over a year had passed since their parting, and after only a short reunion, trouble had already found them again. She harbored a deep hatred for those who disturbed her and Yang Kai’s togetherness.

“Who are blocking the way?” Several senior aunts and uncles from Lingxiao Pavilion behind immediately grew tense.

“Probably men from my Second Brother,” Yang Kai said softly. Yang Wei would neither do such a thing nor have the capital. Thus, the ones blocking the path must be Yang Zhao’s subordinates.

“Senior aunts and uncles, a fight may break out soon. Don’t worry about me—just protect the disciples under you.”

“Can’t we avoid them?” The Lingxiao Pavilion members’ powers were too weak to face others in combat.

“They are prepared. We can’t evade them,” Yang Kai shook his head helplessly, annoyance welling inside.
