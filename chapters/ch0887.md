## Chapter 887 — The First Guest

In the Saint Lord’s Courtyard, Yang Kai sensed the movements of the Long Shuttle Secret Treasure and the patterns within it, probing into its function.

This secret treasure seemed to have something odd about it; not only was it unusually difficult to refine into his body, but coaxing it into resonance with his own essence also consumed a great deal of time.

It had already been four full months since he had taken it into his body and nurtured it with True Yuan and Divine Sense, yet it still showed no reaction at all.

The inside of the secret treasure bore Yang Kai’s aura, but it still couldn’t resonate with him, leaving Yang Kai at a complete loss.

Some faint sounds arose outside, and a moment later Xu Hui’s voice came through: “Saint Lord, this subordinate has a matter and requests an audience!”

“Come in!” Yang Kai called out.

Footsteps sounded, and Xu Hui soon entered. Once inside the side chamber he wore an odd expression, clasped his hands and said with a bow: “Saint Lord, someone came to request the Sacred Land help refine a pill…”

“Oh?” Yang Kai’s expression changed and he asked sharply, “So they finally came?”

“Yes… they finally came.” Xu Hui forced a bitter smile.

It had been a month since Yang Kai had instructed the elders to spread the word through contacts; during this month, this was the very first person to come begging for alchemical help.

The thing was, although the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was still somewhat renowned, it had never produced a Saint-Grade alchemist. When the news went out, few believed it—especially the claim that a Saint-Grade Middle-Level pill could be refined here.

That implied that the Nine Heavens Sacred Land must have at least one Saint-Grade Middle-Level alchemist within!

Saint-Grade Middle-Level alchemists were exceedingly rare—few enough to count on one’s fingers—and those masters’ names were well known and had no ties to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

People simply didn’t believe anyone here could refine such pills.

After waiting a month, only a single person had shown up.

“Where is he?” Yang Kai rubbed his hands together, ready and eager.

“Seated in the guest hall.” Xu Hui replied quickly.

“Good—first business, I’ll go see for myself.” Saying so, Yang Kai strode out and, accompanied by Xu Hui, flew toward the mountain where the guest hall stood.

“Did he say what pill he wants refined?” Yang Kai asked while speeding along.

“A Spirit-Grade Upper-Level Soul Condensing Pill…”

“Only a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level?” Yang Kai was taken aback. He had assumed someone making the trip would at least be seeking a Saint-Grade pill, yet it turned out to be merely a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill.

He felt a little disappointed.

Then again, given the Sacred Land’s reputation hadn’t spread yet, having even one person come to request alchemy was commendable. Yang Kai immediately brightened and prepared to meet the Sacred Land’s first guest in the best state.

A month earlier, upon learning of the Sacred Land’s current plight, an idea had flashed through his mind.

If managed correctly, it could not only alleviate the Sacred Land’s financial crisis, but also dispel its current doldrums and restore its prestige.

Most importantly, he could use the opportunity of refining pills for others to raise his own alchemical skill!

That was what he wanted most.

Saint-Grade ingredients were outrageously difficult to obtain; searching for them alone would be impossible. If he wanted to improve his alchemy, who knew how long it would take.

But most martial artists habitually collect medicinal ingredients. Using the materials they gathered to refine pills was an excellent way to improve his craft.

Since he began studying alchemy he had rarely failed after an early string of mistakes, so he had the confidence to let Xu Hui spread such a bold claim: if we fail, full compensation—an attractive lure for desperate martial artists.

“Soul Condensing Pill…” Yang Kai mused. “This fellow must have a relative or friend whose soul was severely damaged.”

“The Saint Lord studies pills too?” Xu Hui asked in surprise, amazed that from the pill’s name Yang Kai could deduce its purpose—something Xu Hui himself couldn’t do.

“So-so.” Yang Kai chuckled.

Soon the two arrived at the guest hall together.

In the great hall sat a middle-aged man in a gray robe who looked a little uneasy, sitting stiffly and motionless.

Several maidservants stood to one side.

Tea had already been presented to him, but he hadn’t touched it; instead his brow was clouded, his face full of worry.

Yang Kai’s Divine Sense swept over him and found the man was only a First Stage Transcendent Realm martial artist, and he immediately understood why the man had come to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land for alchemical help.

The man wasn’t particularly powerful and carried no high-grade secret treasures; he appeared to come from a small family or minor force.

For such a martial artist to gather the ingredients needed for a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill must have involved many setbacks and troubles, costing him considerable effort.

If he picked an unreliable alchemist and failed, he’d have to start over and search for those ingredients again.

But coming to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was different—Xu Hui had already announced that even in failure full compensation would be offered, so he had no worries.

That guarantee of full compensation upon failure was the chief reason he had come.

Hearing the commotion, the middle-aged man rose and, a little flustered, bowed to Yang Kai and Xu Hui with a nervous laugh: “Elder Xu, I salute you.”

“Sit, don’t be so formal.” Xu Hui replied, displaying a friendly demeanor. As an expert at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, his approachable attitude toward a First Stage Transcendent martial artist left the visitor pleasantly surprised.

The man’s face reddened and he sat down, glancing at Yang Kai with suspicion.

Xu Hui hurriedly introduced him: “Allow me to introduce—this is our Sacred Land’s lord, Yang Kai!”

The middle-aged man rose again, face alight with shock and envy, and exclaimed, “So you are Saint Lord Yang… I’ve long heard of your fame.”

“Infamy, more like,” Yang Kai said with a wry chuckle.

Recently there’d been a string of incidents and rumors that the Sacred Land was colluding with demons and yao, and malicious gossip had spread; so the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s reputation among humans was not good, and Yang Kai, the Saint Lord who consorted with evil, gladly damned to fall, had become widely known.

The man hadn’t expected Yang Kai’s reply and, after a moment’s pause, forced a laugh: “Not at all, not at all…”

“Never mind. I know the rumors outside. Today we won’t discuss those—only alchemy. What should I call you?”

“I am Lü Qingjing.”

“I heard you want a Soul Condensing Pill—did you bring all the ingredients?”

“I brought them.” Lü Qingjing answered quickly, producing a small bundle from the table.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s suspicions were confirmed—this man was indeed not wealthy.

He had no Spatial Pouch; the ingredients were carried in a simple bundle.

Yang Kai gestured, and Xu Hui promptly took the bundle and handed it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai opened it and inspected the herbs. He gave a slight nod: “The herbs are fairly well preserved; their efficacy hasn’t decayed too much. It looks like you put effort into gathering them. Next time don’t store them like this; at least prepare proper containers for medicinal materials.”

Lü Qingjing smiled awkwardly: “Saint Lord Yang is right; I will take care next time.”

“However, your concoction lacks one herb…” Yang Kai said with a faint smile. “No Soul-Steadying Grass. With only these materials your success rate will be greatly reduced—at best thirty percent.”

“Ah?” Lü Qingjing was stunned, bewildered: “Impossible?”

“Whoever told you the recipe must not be a good alchemist.” Yang Kai said bluntly.

Lü Qingjing nodded: “It was told to me by a Lower-Level Spirit-Grade alchemist…”

“No wonder. With these materials even if the pill forms by sheer luck, its effect would likely be insufficient to heal your relative or friend.”

“How could Saint Lord Yang know…” Lü Qingjing was awestruck, his body trembling.

“This pill is meant to gather and bind shattered fragments of a soul,” Yang Kai smiled slightly. “Anyone familiar with pills would know—your family member or friend must have suffered grievous injury in battle and fallen into a coma, yes?”

Lü Qingjing looked full of admiration and nodded: “Saint Lord Yang is correct… To be frank, it is my son—he’s been in a coma for half a year. I’ve been collecting ingredients all this time and only recently completed the set. When I looked for an alchemist to refine it and heard of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s announcement, I hurried here.”

“If you’d gone to another alchemist, not to mention whether he could succeed, he would have asked you to go find Soul-Steadying Grass…”

Lü Qingjing suddenly stared anxiously at Yang Kai, afraid he would make that demand.

That would have been entirely natural.

Alchemists only refine; gathering the herbs is normally the practitioner’s responsibility.

“Our Sacred Land has Soul-Steadying Grass, you don’t need to search for it.”

Upon hearing this, Lü Qingjing’s joy overflowed: “Thank you, Saint Lord Yang! Thank you, Saint Lord Yang!”

“It’s nothing. Wait here a moment. I’ll have someone prepare the refining. If all goes well it’ll take half an hour to an hour.” Yang Kai instructed, taking the herbs and leaving the guest hall.

The great hall was left with Lü Qingjing, Xu Hui, and the silent maidservants standing aside.

Xu Hui wore a puzzled look.

Although he didn’t know much about alchemy, he understood something of the difficulty in refining a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level pill.

Half an hour to an hour—could it really be completed in that time?

Where had the Saint Lord found such a powerful alchemist? Yang Kai had sounded utterly confident and showed no concern for failure—did that mean the alchemist could guarantee success?

Xu Hui couldn’t make sense of it.

Lü Qingjing sat anxiously, prickled by worry; he wanted to rise and pace but dared not be too casual before Elder Xu, stifling his discomfort.

Seeing his state, Xu Hui laughed: “Don’t be so nervous. Since our Sacred Land put out that announcement, even if the refining fails we’ll fully compensate you. You can seek another alchemist if needed; our Sacred Land wouldn’t trick you out of those herbs.”
