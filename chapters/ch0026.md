## Chapter 26 — The Petty Man’s Revenge, Day and Night

At this moment, Yang Kai smiled. Though his strength and spirit were utterly exhausted, his eyes unable to see, ears ringing incessantly, and his mind pierced by stabbing pain like needles, he still smiled.

Victory! The joy of conquering oneself far surpassed that of defeating others!

Just as Yang Kai thought he was about to lose consciousness, a sudden warmth surged from within his bones. It was like the gentle spring breeze and nourishing rain, like a long-awaited sweet drizzle, sweeping over every inch of his skin and flesh, bringing a surge of vibrant life.

His depleted strength recovered slightly, and even his spirit improved considerably. Though not fully restored, it was enough to keep him from fainting.

Yang Kai no longer forced himself but sat down to carefully sense the state of his body. He found that the numbness inside him had vanished, replaced by a soothing comfort that nearly made him moan aloud.

His flesh and blood pulsed rhythmically, becoming noticeably solid and explosive. The qi within his meridians throbbed continuously, and his bones seemed sturdier than before.

Just from this alone, his body felt much stronger.

Yang Kai pondered deeply.

That warmth surging from his bones at the critical moment must be the work of the Proud Bone Golden Body. Having experienced this several times, Yang Kai had grasped the key: only his unyielding spirit and perseverance in the face of adversity could awaken this latent power of the Proud Bone Golden Body.

If he had compromised when confronted with hardship, the Proud Bone Golden Body would offer no aid.

What a temperamental Golden Body it was! Yang Kai chuckled softly. At this point, he finally understood why the incense burner could assist his cultivation.

The medicinal efficacy of the herbs placed inside the burner was amplified a thousandfold. After inhaling it, his physical strength drained faster, and his spirit grew more fatigued, which explained why he nearly lost consciousness after taking just three steps.

Yet, though the incense’s amplified effects were formidable, they should not cause any lasting harm; otherwise, it would not be suitable for cultivation.

Only by overcoming such difficulties and stimulating the Proud Bone Golden Body’s restorative power could he truly benefit and grow stronger through repeatedly pushing his limits.

The exotic fragrance wafting from the incense burner complemented the Proud Bone Golden Body perfectly.

All of this was Yang Kai’s conjecture. But judging from what had just happened, it was essentially the truth. Next, he would need to verify it carefully.

The incense’s fragrance never ceased, drifting toward Yang Kai’s position even though the room was still.

However, Yang Kai found that if he remained still, the fragrance had little effect on him.

After resting for half an hour, Yang Kai felt much restored and shakily stood up, then took a step forward.

Having suffered a heavy loss once, this time Yang Kai moved very slowly, carefully sensing his body as he walked.

The moment his foot touched the ground, he felt his strength inside him drain away like a breached dam, rushing out uncontrollably. His spirit followed suit, suddenly overwhelmed by fatigue without warning or reason.

With the next step, what little strength he had left was completely sucked dry, and Yang Kai nearly collapsed.

Gritting his teeth, his stubborn nature flared up again, forcing himself to move forward.

This time, he managed to walk four steps before he had to stop. Though unwilling to admit defeat, his body simply could not keep up—his strength was still too weak.

Once more, the warmth inside him slowly spread, restoring just enough energy to prevent him from passing out.

After many repeated trials, all of Yang Kai’s guesses were confirmed.

Though the incense’s exotic fragrance caused great fatigue, it left no lasting harm. The Proud Bone Golden Body required his unwavering will to be stimulated—the stronger his resolve, the more intense the warmth, and the greater the benefit to his body.

This method of cultivation was truly extraordinary. To put it bluntly, it was courting death; one misstep could lead to ruin. Fortunately, Yang Kai was self-aware and only pushed his limits slightly each time, accumulating progress steadily.

Human potential was indeed limitless, but to grow stronger, one must proceed step by step.

After a whole day of such torment, Yang Kai’s progress was obvious—he could now walk six steps, a significant improvement from the first attempt.

Yet he remained unsatisfied. For now, he was merely walking while inhaling the fragrance. The real cultivation would begin when he could perform his fists and kicks amid the incense.

Then, Yang Kai discovered a grave problem.

This method consumed too many herbs!

Putting one Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower and one Desolate Deadwood Herb into the burner could sustain the fragrance for about an hour. After that, more herbs had to be added to continue producing the scent.

Yang Kai calculated quickly, his face darkening.

There were twelve hours in a day. If he cultivated seven or eight hours daily, he would need at least fourteen herbs to sustain it. With his current reserves, the Desolate Deadwood Herb would be depleted in two days, and the Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flower would be more than half gone.

What would he do when these herbs ran out? His Contribution Points numbered only thirty-eight—how many more days could that support?

He had thought himself fairly well-off, but now he realized he was still dirt poor.

That night, Yang Kai fell asleep burdened with deep worries, his mind filled with thoughts of how to obtain more herbs and Contribution Points. Even in his dreams, he was gathering vast fields of Three-Leaf Remnant Soul Flowers and Desolate Deadwood Herbs until his limbs grew weak.

He did not sleep well that night.

Nor did Su Mu.

Recalling how he had stormed over that morning with his men to confront Yang Kai, only to be defeated, Su Mu tossed and turned. If not for Yang Kai, perhaps he would already be cozying up to Owner He’s daughter at the Rice Shop. If not for him, he would not be so full of resentment.

Thinking of the bright-eyed daughter of the He family, Su Mu seethed with anger. He felt he would never have the face to approach her again. As the saying goes, better to tear down ten temples than ruin one marriage—Yang Kai’s interference was simply outrageous.

Another saying went: “A gentleman’s revenge may wait ten years; a petty man’s revenge comes day and night.”

Su Mu was undoubtedly the latter. Though he could challenge Yang Kai again in a few days, he could not wait that long. He longed to beat Yang Kai senseless immediately to soothe his hatred.

Unable to sleep, Su Mu rose in frustration, waking not only himself but also his group of underlings in the dead of night.
