## Chapter 592 — Exploration Underground

The entire Zhongdu city was shaken to its core, countless buildings collapsed, dust billowed into the sky, painting a scene as if the end of the world had arrived.

Even those less aware of the situation realized this place was no longer safe.

Every powerful figure from the Eight Great Families and Yang Kai’s household unleashed their full strength, fiercely attacking Yang Bai, attempting to disrupt his actions. Yet the Six Great Evil Kings closely guarded him; without breaking through their defense, it was impossible to inflict any real harm on Yang Bai.

Of the Six Great Evil Kings, except for Shan Qingluo, the other five had all reached the Transcendent Second Stage. Among them, Shadow King and Force King were near the limit of the Second Stage. Reckless of their own safety, they defended Yang Bai desperately, their defense as solid as a fortress.

Shan Qingluo's beautiful eyes flickered with an unusual light. Suddenly, the Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure, the Qingluo Fan, appeared in her delicate hand. She poured True Yuan into it, causing sparks of light to scatter.

The exquisite images of beauties painted on the fan seemed to come alive, flying off the fan surface one by one. Each figure displayed unrestrained lustful instincts—seductive poses, clothing partially undone, revealing vast expanses of enticing flesh.

Whispering voices echoed through heaven and earth, as if awakening the deepest desires within everyone’s heart, turning people into wild beasts driven mad by passion.

This Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure was passed down through generations of the Enchantress Queen lineage. Together with the unmatched allure of the Enchantress Queen of that generation, few could resist its charm.

Even those who had also reached the Transcendent Realm would momentarily lose their focus, falling helplessly into this realm of tender temptation.

At this moment, Shan Qingluo deployed the power of the Qingluo Fan aimed specifically at the Five Evil Kings and Yang Bai.

The simplest-minded Force King’s eyes instantly reddened, his breathing grew heavy, and his lower body swelled prominently, like a tent pitched beneath him.

The other four Evil Kings furrowed their brows tightly, clearly affected to some extent as well.

“Wretched maid!” Force King suddenly regained his senses. Because of his simple mind, he caught the charm quickly and also recovered from it rapidly. With an angry roar, he launched a fierce punch at Shan Qingluo.

The Enchantress Queen’s delicate face paled, her beauty fading. She dared not resist and hastily retreated, but the punch's force still struck her side, making her cry out miserably as she fell toward the ground.

Yang Bai looked at Shan Qingluo coldly, shaking his head. “Qingluo, you disappoint me. Is this truly your choice?”

Shan Qingluo’s expression remained indifferent as she let her body fall. Quietly, she said, “I told you, I am already his woman! Naturally, I cannot help you against him.”

“You will regret this,” Yang Bai sighed softly. “The Peak of Martial Dao truly is a lonely height.”

Even as he spoke, his hands did not cease their movements.

Some of the Eight Great Families’ warriors wanted to pursue and immediately end Shan Qingluo’s life, but Tang Yuxian arrived first.

The Blood Servants knew well about the subtle connection between Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo, so they naturally did not trouble her. Tang Yuxian’s pursuit was merely to rescue Shan Qingluo.

Seeing Tang Yuxian catch the Enchantress Queen, Yang Kai finally exhaled in relief.

Whizz... whizz... whizz...

Suddenly, massive and overwhelming energy beams surged upward from underground. The potency of this energy far exceeded anyone’s expectations. Each stream was so dense it was visible to the naked eye, like columns of light shooting up, covering the entire Zhongdu city.

From above, the chaotic and fragmented city was illuminated by these towering pillars of light stretching to the heavens, radiating an energy that made hearts shudder.

Yang Bai laughed loudly, his figure flickering. He casually chose one of the light beams and dove straight down, disappearing quickly. Only the Five Evil Kings remained, still fighting desperately in place.

“There truly is an Earth Vein!” Yang Yinghao exclaimed.

Seeing this scene, the elder heads of the Eight Great Families immediately realized that the records in their family scriptures were not baseless. Beneath Zhongdu city lay a massive Earth Vein.

Now, Yang Bai had used his own methods to discover it.

“No matter what he intends to do with the Earth Vein, we cannot ignore it!” Yang Yinghao said grimly. After speaking, he and seven others followed Yang Bai, choosing nearby light pillars and plunging into the underground.

Yang Kai frowned, “We should go check it out too.”

Di Mo hurried after him.

At the Yang residence...

Meng Wuya, who had been stationed there to maintain Heavenly Journey Palace and protect Yang Kai’s rear base, suddenly looked excited and thrilled. He immediately soared into the air, gazing at the desolate yet energy-rich scene of Zhongdu city, a gleam of joy lighting his brow. He exclaimed, “The Earth Vein!”

After a moment of shock, he laughed heartily. “After all the searching, it came effortlessly! Ningshang, come with me—I’m about to break the first seal!”

Xia Ningshang perked up upon hearing this and nodded promptly.

She had been adopted and cultivated by Meng Wuya since childhood, being trained thoroughly to seize any opportunity to help Meng Wuya break his shackling seal.

Xia Ningshang also knew that to break the first lock binding Meng Wuya, there had to be a vast and continuous supply of power. No matter its origin, as long as it was sufficient, she could use her special constitution, using Meng Wuya’s body as a furnace and the energy as the source to dissolve the seal.

Refining a person as a pill was something only those with the Medicinal Spirit Saint Body could achieve.

The master and disciple also sought a nearby light pillar, and under Meng Wuya’s protection, they descended underground.

Above Zhongdu city, the strong warriors from the Eight Great Families and Yang Kai’s household continued to besiege the fighters from Cangyun Evil Land. Countless invaders had fallen. Now only about a hundred remained, along with a few lingering demonic beasts.

Although the Five Evil Kings were still capable of fighting, surrounded by dozens of Transcendent Realm warriors, they were trapped with no way out, awaiting exhaustion before being slain.

The situation gradually became clear.

Beneath Zhongdu city, Yang Kai and Di Mo kept following the source of the light beams, falling seemingly endlessly. Though wrapped in thick energy that felt sweet to the taste, the prolonged descent naturally stirred unease—not knowing when it would end.

After the time to burn an incense stick, they finally stepped onto solid ground.

No one knew how deep underground.

The combat, noise, even the aura and energy fluctuations from Zhongdu city above could no longer be sensed. The surroundings were flooded with dense and pure energy, flowing clearly like rivers beside them.

These energies converged and emitted a gentle glow, illuminating even the deep underground without darkness.

“Where did those eight go?” Di Mo looked around but found no trace of Yang Yinghao and the others.

“This way,” Yang Kai signaled a direction. On the ground ahead, he noticed some scattered footprints.

He spread out his Divine Sense but could only perceive about a hundred zhang around him.

Such dense energy restricted the Divine Sense's range.

After walking for a while, several forks appeared ahead. Yang Kai frowned deeply.

The Earth Vein beneath Zhongdu city was labyrinthine, its underground passages winding and intricate—like a maze with twists and turns. With limited Divine Sense, it was no easy task to locate the elder heads of the Eight Great Families and Yang Bai.

They could only rely on the faint footprints left behind.

After turning multiple directions and traversing several forks, even the footsteps of those eight disappeared.

Yang Kai and Di Mo had completely lost track of them. Helpless, Yang Kai could only continue forward by intuition.

Suddenly, Yang Kai stopped and looked back.

“Young Master, is something wrong?”

Yang Kai did not reply.

Soon a slender figure ran hastily from behind. Di Mo was about to intervene but was stopped by Yang Kai.

When the figure drew near, Di Mo realized it was young master’s senior sister, Su Yan.

“Why did you come down here?” Yang Kai hurriedly grabbed Su Yan.

She and the other senior and junior brothers of Lingxiao Pavilion had remained inside Heavenly Journey Palace, not participating in this battle against Cangyun Evil Land. Seeing her here naturally surprised Yang Kai.

“I was following Shopkeeper Meng and Junior Sister,” Su Yan explained. “When I sensed your aura, I came to take a look.”

“Shopkeeper Meng and little senior sister came down too?” Yang Kai was astonished. “What about the residence?”

“The residence is safe. The Heavenly Journey Palace barrier is still intact.”

Yang Kai slightly nodded but was confused again. Meng Wuya, after breaking his own seal, attained Transcendent Second Stage cultivation but at great personal cost. So under normal circumstances, Yang Kai did not want him to engage in battle.

He only needed to stay in the residence and maintain Heavenly Journey Palace’s operation.

Unexpectedly, he actively came out himself.

“Since you’re here, let’s go together,” Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

Su Yan nodded gently.

The three of them searched carefully in the deep underground but could detect no other auras. Su Yan was able to pinpoint Yang Kai’s position because of their close bond, a method limited to only the two of them.

While Yang Kai hesitated, he sensed the energy flowing within the Earth Vein grow abnormal.

Energies from all directions were fiercely converging toward a single point.

It seemed a massive gravitational pull had formed, ravenously devouring the Earth Vein’s energy.

“Let’s go have a look,” Yang Kai’s expression darkened as he hurried toward the energy’s source.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai detected two life auras ahead.

His expression changed. He quickly approached.

At a nearby fork, Yang Kai saw Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang.

Meng Wuya was sitting cross-legged on the ground with a joyful expression. Xia Ningshang stood before him, continuously forming intricate hand seals.

With each seal, energy from the Earth Vein was steadily streaming into Meng Wuya’s body.

As if sensing an approaching presence, Meng Wuya and Xia Ningshang paused their movements, no longer fluid.

After recognizing Yang Kai’s face, both involuntarily exhaled.

“Shopkeeper Meng, what are you doing down here?” Yang Kai asked, astonished.

“Breaking the seal!” Meng Wuya replied softly.
