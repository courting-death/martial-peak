## Chapter 2580 — Divine Spirits’ Nemesis

“Honored guest, you are truly kind-hearted. It seems this old man judged a gentleman with a petty mind.” The Elder stroked his stone beard and smiled faintly.

Yang Kai said, “To be honest, I would actually prefer for Xiaoxiao to stay here and live with you all. Just being able to find him on this trip has already left me completely satisfied.”

Just as he had said earlier, it was far better for Xiaoxiao to find his own tribe and live among his people than to always follow him around in loneliness. No matter what kind of being it was, all living things had a tendency to gather in groups. Being alone for too long would eventually cause problems with one’s state of mind.

The Elder and Mu Na exchanged a glance and nodded slightly, as if they agreed with something Yang Kai had said.

Mu Na pursed her lips in a smile and spoke, “Honored guest, have you ever heard of the Blood Gate?”

Yang Kai frowned, not knowing why the topic had suddenly shifted, but still nodded, “Before coming to the Wild Ancient Land, I hadn’t heard of it, but just recently I happened to hear some legends about the Blood Gate.”

Mu Na’s beautiful eyes lit up. “Since you already know, then I don’t need to explain.”

Yang Kai asked in surprise, “What does the Blood Gate have to do with you?”

This time, Mu Na didn’t answer, but turned to look at the Stone Spirit Elder. The Elder said in a deep voice, “The Blood Gate is of great significance to all living beings in the Ancient Land. There’s a saying that’s been passed down: ‘Enter the Blood Gate, gain new life, return to the ancestral bloodline, and transform into a Divine Spirit!’”

Xie Wuwei had said these words before, just a few days ago, so Yang Kai remembered them clearly.

The Elder continued, “Most creatures in the Ancient Land have heard this saying, but there’s no way to verify if it’s true. Only a few know the real answer. And it is true.”

Yang Kai was slightly moved. “So if you enter the Blood Gate, you really can awaken your ancient bloodline and transform into a Divine Spirit?”

The Elder chuckled, “It’s not guaranteed, it’s just a chance.”

Yang Kai grew interested. “I’d like to hear the details.”

The Elder pondered for a moment, as if weighing his words, and only after a while did he say, “Most creatures of the Ancient Land are remnants of the Primordial Era, so more or less, they all carry the blood and inheritance of Ancient Divine Spirits. Only those who have inherited the bloodline of Ancient Divine Spirits have a chance to transform into a Divine Spirit upon entering the Blood Gate! But the process is extremely dangerous—one in ten thousand survive.”

Mu Na continued, “Since you dared to enter the Wild Ancient Land, your cultivation must be extraordinary. You should have already come into contact with Origin Power, right?”

Yang Kai nodded. Origin Power was something that Dao Origin Realm cultivators had already begun to touch upon. He was already an Emperor, so how could he be unfamiliar with it?

Mu Na said, “To become a Divine Spirit and revive the glory of your ancestors, entering the Blood Gate is only the first step. The real trial begins after you enter. Most creatures of the Ancient Land think that entering the Blood Gate gives them a chance to become a Divine Spirit. That’s not wrong, but it’s too simplistic. They know the result, but not the reason.”

“What is the trial?” Yang Kai asked, frowning, immediately catching the key point.

The Elder said solemnly, “Every Divine Spirit has its own Divine Spirit Origin. Returning to the ancestral bloodline is one thing, but obtaining the recognition of a Divine Spirit Origin is what truly matters. Only those who gain the Origin’s approval have a chance to become a true Divine Spirit.”

Though the words were a bit convoluted, Yang Kai immediately understood.

The Divine Spirit Origin was a very peculiar power. For example, the True Phoenix Fire was a Divine Spirit Origin. A being who obtained the True Phoenix Fire had a great chance of becoming a Fire Phoenix. For example, Liu Yan had received this opportunity, but whether she could succeed depended on her own fortune. If she couldn’t gain the True Phoenix Fire’s recognition, Liu Yan would be doomed. This was a trial for her as well.

In other words, to become a Divine Spirit, both the power of the bloodline and the Divine Spirit Origin were indispensable.

Yang Kai was shocked and hesitated, “Are you saying that inside the Blood Gate… there are Divine Spirit Origins?”

The Elder and Mu Na exchanged a glance, both a bit surprised, as if they thought Yang Kai’s mind was too sharp to have figured this out.

The Elder nodded, “That’s right. There are indeed Divine Spirit Origins inside the Blood Gate. If a being is fortunate enough to enter, they can attempt to fuse with one. If they succeed, they truly become a Divine Spirit. If they fail, only death awaits.”

“Why are there Divine Spirit Origins inside the Blood Gate?” Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

The Elder smiled bitterly, “Because the Blood Gate is just an entrance. Inside, there is a Divine Spirit Palace, where many Divine Spirit Origins are hidden. You could say it contains almost all the Origin Power of the majority of Ancient Divine Spirits.”

Yang Kai was shocked, “How could that be?” Suddenly, a guess came to him, and he said in shock, “Is it like the Tomb of All Spirits, where Divine Spirits, upon death, would enter and leave their Origin Power behind?”

If not, how could the Divine Spirit Palace inside the Blood Gate contain the Origin Power of countless Divine Spirits?

“That’s not the case.” Mu Na shook her head and explained, “Heaven’s way is unpredictable, but the power of Divine Spirits is too great for mortals to resist. In ancient times, there were many Divine Spirits, each with earth-shattering abilities and violent tempers. They often fought, disturbing the world and making it hard for other beings to survive. But all things exist in balance, and yin and yang restrain one another. In time, a peerless expert arose among humanity. That person’s power was uniquely suppressive toward the Divine Spirits—one could say it was their natural nemesis. Over countless years, that expert slew innumerable Divine Spirits who committed evil, seized their Origin Power, and sealed it within the Divine Spirit Palace. Then, with immense divine ability, the Divine Spirit Palace itself was sealed and hidden within the Blood Gate, cutting off the inheritance of countless Divine Spirits and preventing them from continuing their wicked deeds.”

“Divine Spirits’ Nemesis!” Yang Kai gasped. He never imagined such a being existed. Just how powerful was this person?

Mu Na said solemnly, “According to legend, that person’s strength, though formidable, did not exceed the other experts of the same era by too great a margin. Yet that power was uniquely suited to restrain the Divine Spirits—before that person, no Divine Spirit could muster the slightest will to resist; life and death were decided at a single thought. That is why the Divine Spirit Palace contains so much of the Divine Spirits’ Origin Power. That person was called Heaven’s Punisher, signifying the execution of Heaven’s justice. Wielding the Heaven’s Punisher Sword, wherever that expert passed, the Divine Spirits withdrew, all of them terrified at the mere rumor of the arrival.”

Heaven’s Punisher!

Yang Kai memorized the name and nodded slightly, but soon asked suspiciously, “How do you know about such ancient matters?”

Mu Na glanced at the Elder, who chuckled, “When it comes to longevity, there’s probably no race in the world that can outlive my Stone Spirit Race. These things have been passed down by word of mouth in my tribe. It was only two generations ago.”

Two generations… Yang Kai’s mouth twitched. He realized this Stone Spirit Elder must be a monster who had lived for hundreds of thousands of years. No wonder he looked so ancient.

Yang Kai took a deep breath to calm his heart and asked suspiciously, “Elder, you and the tribe leader called me here and told me all this. What do you want me to do?”

The Elder’s expression suddenly turned solemn. “I would like to ask you for a favor, honored guest. Help my Stone Spirit Race retrieve the Divine Spirit Origin left by our ancestor.”

Yang Kai was stunned. “Elder, was your Stone Spirit Race’s ancestor also a Divine Spirit?”

The Elder nodded, “That’s right. Our ancestor was named Tai Yue. In those years, for offending Heaven’s Punisher, he was slain, his Origin Power taken and sealed within the Divine Spirit Palace.”

Yang Kai’s face twitched. “Why are you coming to me for help? I really don’t know anything about this. Besides, there’s something strange going on at the Blood Gate right now—the four Saint Venerables of the Yao Race all have their eyes on it. Getting inside the Blood Gate won’t be easy.”

Mu Na said, “We’re well aware of that. The Blood Gate’s abnormality is a sign from the heavens. If not for this, we wouldn’t have thought of acting now.”

The Elder sighed, “Though the Stone Spirit Race is strong, survival is not easy. Because of our extraordinary power, the four great Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land have always wanted to subdue us. Not long ago, they issued a final ultimatum: if we do not submit, they will destroy us completely. If we want to resist, we must have the power to fight them, and the Blood Gate is our last chance.”

Yang Kai frowned, realizing the Stone Spirit Race had no other choice. That’s why they set their sights on the Blood Gate, hoping to reclaim Tai Yue’s Origin Power and stand against the four Saint Venerables.

Xiaoxiao was now also a member of the Stone Spirit Race, so their survival was tied to his interests. Yang Kai couldn’t just ignore it.

After thinking for a moment, Yang Kai said, “If you’re willing, Elder, I can take you out of the Wild Ancient Land. The four Saint Venerables are powerful, but as long as we leave here, they probably won’t be able to reach you.”

The Elder gave a bitter smile, “It’s hard to leave one’s homeland. I hope you understand.”

That was a refusal.

Mu Na said, “The Elder wants Shi Jiu to inherit Tai Yue’s power. If he succeeds, Shi Jiu will become the new Tai Yue and have the strength to protect both the Stone Spirit and Wood Spirit Races. Shi Jiu was raised by you, honored guest. Surely you hope for his success too?”

Why did it feel like they were setting him up? Yang Kai couldn’t help but mutter inwardly. But hearing that the Elder wanted Xiaoxiao to inherit Tai Yue’s power, Yang Kai couldn’t help but be tempted.

If Xiaoxiao could really inherit Tai Yue’s power, he would become a new Divine Spirit.

Just imagine—one day, Xiaoxiao becomes Tai Yue, and Liu Yan becomes the Fire Phoenix. What a wonderful scene that would be.

Though tempted, Yang Kai still asked seriously, “Why must Xiaoxiao inherit Tai Yue’s power? Isn’t there anyone else?”

The Elder smiled, “Shi Jiu is still young and very adaptable. If he inherits it, the chances of success are highest.”

“So there’s still a chance of failure?” Yang Kai frowned.

The Elder and Mu Na fell silent. This question was clearly hard to answer.

Yang Kai’s face darkened, “Does Xiaoxiao know about this?”

The Elder nodded, “I’ve already asked Shi Jiu, and he agreed.”

Yang Kai looked unhappy, “So even if I don’t help, you’re still going to break into the Blood Gate?”

“Exactly!” the Elder replied firmly.

Yang Kai’s expression turned ugly. Since they’d already decided, why bother telling him? Although the Stone Spirit and Wood Spirit Races had left a good impression, he didn’t have much of a relationship with them. If they wanted to throw their lives away, it was none of his business. The key was that Xiaoxiao was involved.

Yang Kai secretly thought, maybe he should find a chance to snatch Xiaoxiao and run away, so he wouldn’t get dragged into this mess.
