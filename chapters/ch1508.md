## Chapter 1508 — Incomplete Spiritual Intellect

As Xiaoxiao's master, Yang Kai naturally felt the agitation and unease in its heart; if he could, he certainly would not refuse Xiaoxiao's request.

But Yang Kai only had a half‑baked understanding of creatures like Stone Puppets, and had no idea what was wrong now, causing the second Stone Puppet not only to fail to hatch but to have its vitality extinguished.

Even if he had the will, he was powerless.

Master and servant's minds were linked; sensing Yang Kai's helplessness, the hopeful light in Xiaoxiao's eyes gradually dimmed.

It sniffed lightly like a child who had been wronged.

After a long while, it gently placed the Stone Embryo before Yang Kai and carefully touched it, as if afraid of moving too roughly and harming it.

Then Xiaoxiao darted to the cliff edge of the towering peak, pounding its chest with force that sounded like drums; its small body swelled rapidly and in the blink of an eye it became a stone giant over ten zhang tall.

Like a colossal gorilla standing atop the peak, its back hunched and hands hanging low, it gazed at the billowing clouds.

A long howl, like a rolling dragon's cry, issued from its mouth.

The cry reached the heavens, containing unimaginable destructive force that churned the seas of clouds into turmoil.

The howl was suffused with an irrepressible grief and sorrow.

A drop, crystal like jade, slid from Xiaoxiao's eye and fell to the ground with a clear, crisp sound.

A Stone Puppet shed tears!

Yang Kai had never imagined that a Stone Puppet would ever shed tears; he couldn't fathom what the second Stone Puppet's Stone Embryo meant to Xiaoxiao to make it so sorrowful, yet now its silhouette looked desolate and alone.

As if in all of heaven and earth it stood utterly alone, destined to be solitary for life.

Yang Kai sprang up and rushed to the Stone Embryo, producing a strand of Golden Blood Threads with a snap and slicing it around his wrist.

A few‑inch long wound, deep enough to show bone, immediately appeared and golden blood welled forth, dripping drop by drop onto the Stone Embryo.

It shouldn't be like this. Xiaoxiao's birth had been unbelievably smooth; Yang Kai had been bewildered at the time—the creature had fused with that Blood Essence Stone in the Black Book Space by itself, then effortlessly broke the shell.

Why was the second one so difficult? At this moment there wasn't even the slightest fluctuation of life.

Whatever the reason, it was still one of Xiaoxiao’s kind. Toward its birth, Xiaoxiao had placed expectations a thousand, ten thousand times greater than for himself.

Yang Kai couldn't believe that such a vigorous being could truly die like this.

Do all within one's power. Leave the rest to fate!

Tick‑tick, tick‑tick sounded as drop after drop of pure Golden Blood fell onto the Stone Embryo.

The Golden Blood contained unimaginable power of Qi and blood and life force; when Xiaoxiao was born, Yang Kai had done the same, though then he had only given a single drop.

But now he spared no cost.

Sensing Yang Kai's action, Xiaoxiao immediately turned and ran over, squatting before him with a face full of gratitude, glancing anxiously at the Stone Embryo as if worried about gain and loss.

Time passed bit by bit; the Stone Embryo had been completely dyed golden, but to Yang Kai's disappointment his Golden Blood seemed to have no effect—the Stone Embryo showed no sign of absorbing it.

This dulled his expression.

Xiaoxiao beside him was as anxious as ants on a hot pan, writhing uneasily.

After a while, an extremely faint fluctuation emanated from the Stone Embryo; Yang Kai stirred—he thought perhaps his hope had given him an illusion, but when he sent out his Divine Sense to probe carefully, he couldn't help but grin.

There really was a pulse coming from the Stone Embryo.

It was the tremor of life!

Like a spark that could ignite a prairie fire, once that faint, almost‑extinguishable tremor issued forth, the Stone Embryo began to absorb the pure Golden Blood dripping onto it; visibly, blood that had once been rejected flowed drop by drop into the Stone Embryo.

Thud, thud...

A sound like a heartbeat echoed again atop the peak—the rhythm of life.

Yang Kai grinned; the grief in the Stone Puppet's eyes vanished, replaced by tension and worry.

Thud, thud...

The sound grew louder and the intervals shorter; the once‑vanished life pulse issued again from the Stone Embryo, and the dim light bloomed anew—unlike before, the light was blood‑red interlaced with gold, appearing exceedingly mysterious.

One pattern after another surfaced on the Stone Embryo's surface like living things, flashing and gone.

Yang Kai watched, clicking his tongue in wonder; he had never seen such a scene when Xiaoxiao was born and didn't know how this Stone Puppet differed from Xiaoxiao.

Day and night passed; three days flew by in the blink of an eye.

Yang Kai had long since stopped dripping Golden Blood into the Stone Embryo; after absorbing a full twenty to thirty drops of pure Golden Blood, the Stone Embryo regained its luster.

Now Yang Kai and Xiaoxiao anxiously waited nearby.

Suddenly, a light cracking sound rang out; Yang Kai's expression perked and he immediately focused his attention.

Upon looking, he could not contain his joy: a fine crack had appeared on the Stone Embryo.

No sooner had that crack appeared than more followed, and soon the Stone Embryo was covered with dense, intersecting fissures like a spiderweb.

Crack...

The Stone Embryo shattered, revealing the life nurtured within.

The second Stone Puppet!

Like a fledgling breaking its shell, it laboriously wriggled out of the Stone Embryo and looked upon this brand‑new, strange world.

Its movements were clumsy—perhaps because it was newly born—and it took a long time to wriggle out, finally sitting on the ground.

Only... it was a golden Stone Puppet, much to Yang Kai's surprise, its whole body glittering like golden armor—perhaps related to the many drops of Golden Blood he had given.

Just as when Xiaoxiao was born, after straightening itself the golden Stone Puppet's first act was to swallow every fragment of the Stone Embryo into its belly with astonishing speed, without even chewing.

After swallowing everything, it sat there dumbly, motionless.

Xiaoxiao, on the other hand, bounced about with joy written all over its face.

But that was not all; it leapt to its companion, picked it up and slung it over its shoulder, then raced around the peak at breakneck speed, lap after lap, repeating monotonously without any sign of fatigue.

Yang Kai let out a quiet laugh, but despite his delight his brow furrowed.

Creatures like Stone Puppets are born with low intelligence—Xiaoxiao was the same; it rejoiced only that its companion was born safely and at the thought of having kin to accompany it, but Yang Kai felt that something was amiss.

There seemed to be something wrong with the golden Stone Puppet.

After a long while Yang Kai told Xiaoxiao to stop playing and set the second Stone Puppet down.

Xiaoxiao complied without resistance.

Only then did Yang Kai begin to examine it carefully.

After a moment, his brow furrowed even more tightly.

Sure enough, it was wrong: although this golden Stone Puppet appeared stronger at birth than Xiaoxiao, its intelligence was even lower than Xiaoxiao's—in fact it could be said to be in a state of complete chaos.

After Xiaoxiao put it down, it merely stood there blankly, nowhere near as lively as Xiaoxiao.

Yang Kai tried issuing it several commands, but it showed no response at all.

Its spiritual intelligence was incomplete! Yang Kai’s face darkened.

Although Stone Puppets are not highly intelligent by nature, they still possess some degree of intellect; this golden Stone Puppet, however, had almost none—perhaps the hardships of its birth were to blame.

The golden Stone Puppet now, though a living being, was no different from a fool—indeed it was even worse than a fool.

Realizing this, Yang Kai fell silent.

Fortunately Xiaoxiao could not perceive this, or else who knew how devastated it would become.

While he pondered, Xiaoxiao, as if offering a treasure, opened its mouth and presented an unrefined rare ore to its companion with eager devotion.

Fortunately the golden Stone Puppet, though lacking intellect, still had instincts; it knew to grab the rare ore and gnaw at it—the crunching sounded, and within a few bites it swallowed it, then resumed standing there blankly.

Xiaoxiao seemed puzzled, not knowing how it had offended its companion to be treated so coldly; scratching its head, it kept bringing more ore.

The latter accepted everything without refusal; the two little ones worked together with perfect tacit understanding.

Watching the golden Stone Puppet, Yang Kai sighed slightly: though the situation was better than at first, it was far from perfect; at least he had done all he could—without intelligence in the golden Stone Puppet, he truly had no way to save it.

As he watched, Yang Kai's expression shifted—he suddenly remembered something, his face alternating with emotion.

After a while his eyes brightened; he scrutinized the golden Stone Puppet carefully, a trace of excitement on his face.

He abruptly thought of how to make the golden Stone Puppet act on its own.

The Golden Stone Puppet’s dullness now was simply because its spirit was incomplete. If that could be remedied, then every other problem would resolve itself naturally.

Yang Kai couldn't complete its intellect, but he could implant one!

He knew the Incarnation Technique!

The Incarnation Technique was created by the Great Demon God; on the Tongxuan Continent the Great Demon God was a prodigy whose talents stunned the world—a legendary figure without predecessor or successor.

Back when Yang Kai was in the Sacred Tomb of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, he once obtained a drop of the Great Demon God's Golden Blood; after refining it, he comprehended a secret art from that Golden Blood—the Incarnation Technique.

Although he had practiced it then, he had never found a suitable vessel and could only nurture that strand of Soul Incarnation within his Sea of Consciousness.

Later he entered the Star Domain and drifted to the Floating Continent, where Yang Kai, under pressure from the Ghost Ancestor, was forced to test the operation of a Space Array for him. Being unable to risk his person, Yang Kai released his Soul Incarnation into the Space Array. Though the Soul Incarnation suffered great damage and nearly perished, after years of nurturing that strand had fully recovered.

Not only that, it had become many times stronger than before. That strand of Soul Incarnation was a very special existence: because Yang Kai had nurtured it separately, it had little entanglement with his own Sea of Consciousness, so even if it vanished it would not affect him.
