## Chapter 2261 — I'll Return Him to You

Sensing the other's ill intent, Ning Yuanshu was stunned; his face drained of color. Light flashed beneath his feet as he tried to retreat with a burst of speed.

But how could he possibly escape?

Yang Kai had already reached out, grabbed his collar, and with his other hand slapped that handsome face repeatedly.

Crack, crack, crack…

After a series of crisp slaps, Ning Yuanshu was completely stunned.

By the time Yang Kai withdrew his hand, Ning Yuanshu’s cheeks were swollen high on both sides, like a pig’s head that had been soaked in water for days.

All the surrounding cultivators were silent as cicadas in winter, each glancing over with expressions of shock.

Although Yang Kai had previously lost his temper at the Qin Family, killed Evil Moon Valley’s Deputy Valley Lord, and injured a middle-aged man, neither Qu Huairen nor that man came from particularly noble backgrounds. Their Sects didn’t have any Emperor Realm experts overseeing them, so as long as Yang Kai was strong enough, he didn’t have to worry about retaliation.

But Ning Yuanshu was different. He was the Young Palace Master of Fei Sheng Palace, after all.

Among the many Sects, Fei Sheng Palace was considered quite formidable in the eyes of the crowd. Ning Yuanshu’s father, Ning Boyang, was himself a First Stage Emperor Realm master, and the Palace boasted no shortage of other powerful experts. On top of that, the two Protectors, Gao Shan and Liu Shui, personally oversaw matters here.

Now that the Young Palace Master had been beaten, how could Fei Sheng Palace possibly let this go?

Thinking of this, the crowd looked at Yang Kai with not only deep wariness but also a sense of schadenfreude, feeling this guy was too bold for his own good and was bound to bring disaster upon himself.

"You… you… dare hit me?" Ning Yuanshu, still held in Yang Kai's grasp, his cheeks badly swollen and the pain already dulled, stared wide-eyed at Yang Kai and mumbled indistinctly.

Yang Kai sneered, “Dare or not, haven’t I already done it?”

“I am the…”

“I know, I know. The Young Palace Master of Fei Sheng Palace!” Yang Kai said, then slapped him a few more times. Finally, he turned to Qin Chaoyang with a smile, “This guy is something else. Even after being beaten, he still doesn’t forget to announce his identity, as if he’s not embarrassed enough yet.”

As he spoke, he lifted Ning Yuanshu high and shouted, “Come, come, everyone take a good look! This is the famous Young Palace Master of Fei Sheng Palace, Ning Yuanshu. Remember this face—if you see him in the future, make sure to take a detour.”

The surrounding cultivators all broke out in cold sweat, thinking, "You’ve beaten him into a pig’s head—who could even recognize him now?"

“Wah…” As soon as he spoke, Ning Yuanshu’s qi and blood surged, and he spat out a mouthful of blood mist.

He came from a distinguished background and had been pampered since childhood—when had he ever suffered such humiliation? Yet now, under the gaze of the crowd, Yang Kai had slapped his face twice in succession. He nearly fainted from rage, but only spat out a mouthful of blood—proof enough of his formidable inner fortitude.

Qin Chaoyang could only smile wryly; he could only sigh that young people truly have vigorous qi and blood. Thinking back, had he not been the same in his youth?

Whoosh, whoosh…

Two streaks of light shot over from the front. The auras within were somewhat disheveled, as if they’d just experienced a fierce battle.

“Ah… Young Palace Master!” As the light stopped, two figures appeared not far from Yang Kai and the others, revealing the two Protectors, Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

At this very moment, the two veteran elders of Fei Sheng Palace looked utterly bedraggled. Their white hair and beards were in complete disarray, their robes torn and tattered in many places. Gao Shan was clutching an ancient zither-like Secret Treasure to his chest, its radiance dim and lackluster, clearly having suffered damage to its spiritual essence. Liu Shui, meanwhile, had a flute hanging at his waist, in no better condition.

The two of them, for some reason, had come from the opposite direction. Seeing Ning Yuanshu’s current state, they were both shocked.

“Left and Right Protectors…” As soon as Ning Yuanshu saw Gao Shan and Liu Shui, his eyes flashed with a fierce light, and he gritted his teeth, “Avenge me at once! Kill this brat!”

“You did this?” Gao Shan’s eyes turned cold as he glared at Yang Kai and demanded.

Liu Shui’s face was gloomy. Without a word, he drew the flute from his waist, Origin Qi surging around him.

Yang Kai ignored the two old men, only squinting at something behind them. After a moment, his brows suddenly furrowed and his expression grew solemn.

“Brat, let go!” Seeing Yang Kai unmoved, Gao Shan roared in anger. At the same time, Liu Shui’s figure flickered and suddenly appeared at Yang Kai’s side, his flute-shaped Secret Treasure pointing at Yang Kai’s wrist.

“Brother Yang, be careful!” Qin Chaoyang cried out in alarm.

With his cultivation and eyesight, he hadn’t even seen how Liu Shui had gotten so close. His warning came too late.

But Yang Kai just laughed, not caring about Liu Shui’s attack at all. He swung Ning Yuanshu around, using the Young Palace Master as a shield.

Liu Shui frowned and had no choice but to withdraw, retreating back to Gao Shan’s side.

Gao Shan’s face was dark as he gently plucked the zither in his arms. A clear, melodious sound instantly spread in all directions. The nearby cultivators who heard it all turned pale and quickly circulated their Origin Qi to block their ears.

“Brat, what grudge does my Fei Sheng Palace have with you, that you would treat the Young Palace Master so viciously?” Gao Shan asked while playing the zither.

“I don’t know,” Yang Kai replied, holding Ning Yuanshu in front of him and peeking out from behind him with a sneaky grin. “You’ll have to ask your Young Palace Master. He suddenly attacked me, so I just fought back.”

Ning Yuanshu’s eyes were full of resentment. He wanted to resist, but Yang Kai had suppressed his cultivation, so he couldn’t even muster his Origin Qi. He gritted his teeth and said, “Left and Right Protectors, this is the brat surnamed Yang who might have killed Eldest Brother. Capture him and take him back to the Palace for interrogation!”

“Hm? He’s that Yang?” Gao Shan and Liu Shui were both startled. They remembered seeing Yang Kai at the Qin Family before but hadn’t asked his name, and now they were full of regret.

“Killed your Eldest Brother?” Yang Kai burst out laughing, his mind racing as he realized why Ning Yuanshu had attacked him. He shouted, “Believe it or not, your Eldest Brother’s death has nothing to do with me!”

Although it was true that he had destroyed Ning Yuancheng’s body, the real killer was Mu Xiao. When Mu Xiao’s seed erupted inside Ning Yuancheng, it completely took his life. What Yang Kai killed was just the Mu Xiao clone occupying Ning Yuancheng’s body.

So, Ning Yuancheng’s death really didn’t have much to do with him.

“Whether it does or not isn’t for you to decide. If you know what’s good for you, come back to the Palace with us. The Palace Master will judge!” Gao Shan shouted.

Yang Kai let out a mocking laugh and said, “You think I’ll just go with you because you say so? Where’s my dignity in that? Besides… are you two really so relaxed standing here? A real killer is about to catch up with you!”

His words had a hidden meaning, leaving many people confused.

But Gao Shan and Liu Shui’s faces changed dramatically, and they quickly turned to look behind them.

Buzz…

Suddenly, the world trembled. A massive pressure swept in from the distance, pressing down on all sides. Every cultivator felt as if a mountain was crushing them.

Under this unimaginable pressure, even the rocks and dirt on the ground began to float upward. Such a phenomenon was simply inconceivable.

“What is this…?”

“Could it be an Emperor Realm expert has arrived?”

“Ah, I can’t take it, I’m going to die…”

Ning Yuanshu was already injured, and now he coughed up even more blood, staining his white clothes a shocking red.

“This is…” Among the Eight Directions Sect disciples who had followed Yang Kai and Qin Chaoyang, a round-faced young woman’s expression suddenly changed as she seemed to sense something, looking fearfully into the distance.

The other Eight Directions Sect disciples were also uneasy, their faces full of fear.

Suddenly, a figure appeared on the horizon.

That person was completely shrouded in an indescribable energy, the powerful and violent force swirling around him, making onlookers shiver with fear.

Wherever he passed, the universe shattered, heaven and earth were turned upside down, and the world itself seemed inverted.

His hair was wild with rage, and his aura was no less than that of an Emperor Realm expert. Amidst the chaotic energy, only a pair of bright eyes shone through, the cold gleam within making one feel as if they’d fallen into an ice cellar.

That person was none other than Luo Yuan of the Eight Directions Sect!

Previously, Luo Yuan had fought Gao Shan and Liu Shui outside the city. No one knew what had happened, but the two elders had fled in panic like stray dogs, and now Luo Yuan was chasing after them.

“Tsk tsk, what an aura!” Yang Kai clicked his tongue in admiration, his face full of respect. “What’s rare is that he hasn’t lost his mind or been consumed by power. This secret technique is incredible. I wonder if he’s mastered it yet.”

Earlier, Luo Yuan had said he was trying to comprehend a secret technique but couldn’t grasp it, so he wanted to spar with Yang Kai. Yang Kai had diverted the trouble to Gao Shan and Liu Shui. Now, it seemed that even if Luo Yuan hadn’t fully mastered the technique, he was close. Who knew what kind of mysterious art it was, to let his aura rise to the level of an Emperor Realm expert.

Luo Yuan had been far away, but in the blink of an eye, he was almost upon them. No one saw how he moved.

“Not good!” Gao Shan and Liu Shui had suffered a great loss at Luo Yuan’s hands earlier, or they wouldn’t have fled so miserably. Now, seeing this fiend chasing after them, their courage nearly failed, and they dared not stay put.

The two exchanged a glance, understanding each other instantly. One raised his flute and began to play, the other strummed his zither, and the flowing music was like a mountain stream.

Many cultivators found their spirits dazed for a moment.

As the music sounded, Gao Shan and Liu Shui flanked Yang Kai from left and right, reaching him in the blink of an eye.

Liu Shui swung his flute at Yang Kai’s head, while Gao Shan’s zither music suddenly changed, his five fingers plucking out wave after wave of attacks, all aimed at Yang Kai.

“Hahaha!” Yang Kai laughed loudly, mocking, “Since you want him so badly, I’ll return him to you!”

As he spoke, he gave a slight twist and flung Ning Yuanshu straight into the zither attacks.

“Impossible!”

“Not good!”

Gao Shan and Liu Shui cried out in shock, their faces suddenly changing.
