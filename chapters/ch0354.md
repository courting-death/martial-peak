## Chapter 354 — Threatening Me?

The campfire flickered, and echoes of explosions filled the air as countless eyes focused on Yang Kai, revealing a myriad of emotions: worry, surprise, shock, fear, humiliation, and anger.

From the ranks of Leiguang, a young man stepped forward, his expression grim as he looked at Yang Kai. He spoke in a deep voice, “Friend, let's talk this out. Can we release her first?”

Immediately, someone from Feihong Courtyard chimed in, shouting, “Quickly release Senior Sister Li Fu!”

The proud daughter of their Sect, admired and revered by countless Senior Brothers, was now being humiliated with a foul foot on her beautiful face—how could the young men of Feihong Courtyard endure such a sight?

This was desecration! This was an insult!

Yang Kai squinted, his eyes glinting with cold light as he grinned, “Talk this out?”

The young man from Leiguang replied, neither humble nor overbearing, “We haven’t done anything to you, have we? Your actions are rather excessive.”

“Interesting!” Yang Kai chuckled, tilting his head towards Guan Chile and said, “Senior, what do you think?”

Only Guan Chile, as a master of the Divine Roaming Realm, could sense the peril moments ago. The others present were all below the Divine Roaming Realm and could not perceive the danger Yang Kai just faced.

The two soul attacks from the masters of Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard had been silent. If not for Yang Kai's earlier training in Divine Sense, along with soul techniques for defense, he might have been doomed by now.

To others, it merely seemed that Xie Rong had shouted to strike first, and Yang Kai had retaliated barbarically.

But the real situation was only clear to Yang Kai and Guan Chile.

Guan Chile was also slightly taken aback; he couldn’t comprehend how Yang Kai remained safe. Hearing Yang Kai address him, he quickly stood up, his demeanor less casual than before, and when he looked at Yang Kai, there was even a trace of seriousness on his face.

After pondering for a moment, Guan Chile sneered, “What is tolerable; what is intolerable!”

“Haha, well said, Senior!” Yang Kai laughed heartily, pressing his foot down harder on Li Fu’s delicate face.

“You… you dare do this to me!” Li Fu shrieked, but as she spoke, she immediately tasted the dirt and sand in her mouth. Her once beautiful face lost all color, her eyes filled with humiliation and unwillingness.

Her cultivation wasn’t high, nor was her talent outstanding. But in Feihong Courtyard, a second-rate Sect, she was considered above average. Coupled with her beauty, she had everything one could want and usually acted haughty; aside from Xiang Chu, she had never put any other young men in her eyes. Never had she faced such humiliation.

Feeling the sand in her mouth, imagining herself being trampled, Li Fu nearly fainted.

“Shut up!” Yang Kai glanced at her with indifference.

“I curse you…” Xie Rong evidently was unwilling to be outdone. He opened his mouth to curse.

Before he could finish his sentence, he was met with a fist from Yang Kai.

With a loud bang, Xie Rong's half-finished sentence got swallowed back, losing five or six teeth in an instant, his mouth filled with blood.

His expression turned fearful; he dared not speak again.

“Stop it!” At this moment, the two masters from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard rushed over. After being attacked by Yang Kai's soul technique, they immediately realized the situation was dire and hurried over, yet still arrived too late.

With a swish, the two appeared ten zhang away from Yang Kai, watching him coldly and cautiously.

Guan Chile subtly shifted his position, placing himself in between.

Yang Kai raised his gaze, his expression calm as he looked at the two approaching.

Neither of them had impressive strength; they were below Guan Chile’s level and only had two layers of cultivation in the Divine Roaming Realm.

After all, the real powerhouses had all been called away; those left behind were merely to oversee the younger generation and did not require high cultivation bases.

The three men stared at each other, the atmosphere heavy and strange.

After a long pause, the two glanced at the bloodied Xie Rong and the half-buried Li Fu, their faces flushed with embarrassment.

It was a disgrace for them as elder disciples to have their juniors bullied. Moreover, this incident had occurred under their sneaky attack, further highlighting their incompetence.

“Consider this a lesson.” The Divine Roaming Realm expert from Leiguang said solemnly.

“Mutual understanding!” Yang Kai replied indifferently.

The Divine Roaming Realm master from Feihong Courtyard cleared his throat hesitantly and said, “Young man, release her first. This isn’t a good sight, you know.”

“That’s your problem, not mine!” Yang Kai retorted.

The man's expression darkened slightly. “Why go this far?”

The Divine Roaming Realm master from Leiguang's face also looked displeased as he said coldly, “Young man, regarding what just happened, the two of us apologize. Why don’t you release her? It’s wise to leave room for future encounters.”

His words were ambiguous; to others, it sounded like he was making excuses for Xie Rong and Li Fu's rudeness, but Yang Kai understood he meant the ambush against him.

With a grin, Yang Kai erupted with bravado, “Some matters can’t be settled with mere apologies.”

“What do you plan to do?” The expert from Leiguang's expression suddenly darkened. Although he knew Yang Kai was formidable, he saw no need for fear now. It was only because Xie Rong and Li Fu’s lives were in the opponent's hands that he pulled a long face. This was already his limit.

“I don’t wish to do anything!” Yang Kai laughed coldly, the True Essence in his hands fluctuating dangerously, akin to a venomous snake.

What he wanted most was to understand why these two harbored murderous intent against him!

He had just returned here today with the Sisters from the Hu Family, and it made no sense for him to face such sudden hostility and targeting.

Directly asking would certainly yield no answers. Yang Kai vaguely felt that this matter had some hidden complexity, maybe due to jealousy from someone!

“I advise you to quickly release her; otherwise, you will regret it for life!” The Leiguang master, with a sense of superiority, was reluctant to continue this back-and-forth with Yang Kai, battles and True Essence subtly swirling as he indicated that if Yang Kai did not release them, he would act.

“You dare threaten me?” Yang Kai frowned, a hint of malevolence appearing on his face.

“You can consider it as such!” The master from Leiguang replied coldly.

“And you?” Yang Kai turned his gaze towards the expert from Feihong Courtyard, his narrowed eyes glittering with danger.

The person snorted lightly, saying nothing, their intent clear.

“Good!” Yang Kai tilted his head slightly, suddenly his expression contorted into a sinister snarl, and both hands discharged True Essence simultaneously towards one of Xie Rong and Li Fu's shoulders.

Accompanied by two cracking sounds, the faces of both Xie Rong and Li Fu turned pale, followed by their pitiful screams.

Each had their arm broken!

“You…” The experts from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard changed drastically, staring at Yang Kai in fear and disbelief, never expecting he would be this insane.

Guan Chile looked at him as if he were a lunatic, his gaze bizarre.

All the young members felt likewise.

Yang Kai’s expression was frosty as he cast a cold glance at the two, disdain gleaming in his eyes. He snorted, “The next strike will land on their chests!”

“You dare!” The masters from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard were both furious. If Yang Kai struck their chests, Xie Rong and Li Fu would not survive.

“You can try!” Yang Kai said with contempt.

The two could not help but be slightly dazed. They could perceive not a shred of hesitation or fear from Yang Kai’s face, nor any threat or jest in his tone.

What he said was the truth.

Only then did the two understand that this young man before them had never feared them; otherwise, he would not have acted so decisively. Moreover, his character clearly responded better to soft tactics than hard ones; their threats just now had evidently infuriated him.

“Speak! How can we resolve this peacefully?” The Divine Roaming Realm expert from Feihong Courtyard took a deep breath and asked in a low voice.

“You cannot provide me with the answers I seek.” Yang Kai chuckled, his gaze slightly shifting to a certain spot in the darkness.

In that direction, Xiang Chu wrinkled his nose, an amused expression forming on his elegant face.

“Second Master…” A Divine Roaming Realm expert behind him frowned slightly, “Is he looking at you?”

“Yes.” Xiang Chu nodded lightly, “He knows I’m here; how did he know?”

“This young man's intuition is remarkably sharp!”

“Perhaps.” Xiang Chu felt something strange as well but could not find a better explanation. After pondering for a moment, he laughed freely and stepped forward.

Moments later, he approached the location of the incident, calling out, “What happened? Why do I hear the sounds of fighting?”

Sensing that a decisive figure had arrived, the tense atmosphere lightened considerably.

However, the disciples from Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower felt some apprehension. In contrast, those from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard couldn’t help but gloat.

They believed that Yang Kai’s audacious attack on Xie Rong and Li Fu would surely lead to repercussions.

“Second Master Xiang!” The three Divine Roaming Realm experts immediately rushed to Xiang Chu to bow.

Xiang Chu merely nodded slightly, smiling kindly at the Sisters from the Hu Family.

Xie Rong and Li Fu shouted in unison, “Second Master, save us! This man wants to kill us!”

Before their voices fell silent, Yang Kai swung his hands and slapped them twice.

The sharp cracks echoed loudly in the night.

Xiang Chu furrowed his brow slightly, gazing across the tens of zhang distance towards Yang Kai.

There was a hint of displeasure in his eyes, though it was well hidden.

“Second Master, it’s like this…” The master from Leiguang hastily stepped forward, eager to report what had transpired.

However, Xiang Chu raised his hand, scanning the crowd, finally resting his gaze on Hu Mei’er. “Mei’er, explain what happened.”

Concerned for Yang Kai, Hu Mei’er did not bother with Xiang Chu’s title and recounted the earlier events truthfully.

“Is that so?” After hearing, Xiang Chu looked to the people from Leiguang and Feihong Courtyard, asking.

They hesitated, unsure how to respond, casting looks at their respective elders.

Xiang Chu sneered, “What’s this? I’m asking a question, and no one’s responding?”

Everyone hurriedly lowered their heads, speaking in unison, “Yes.”

Xiang Chu laughed lightly, “In that case, Xie Rong and Miss Li Fu were at fault. Even though we belong to different Sects, since we arrived here, we are all part of the fight against Cangyun Evil Land, so we should help one another. Your provocation came first; this friend teaching a lesson in return is only natural. If you are outmatched, you cannot blame others. Now quickly rise and apologize to the disciples of Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang!”
