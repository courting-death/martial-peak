## Chapter 1902 — Marriage Proposal

"Ha ha, I was only joking, Chairman Ai Ou, you needn't take it to heart!" Suddenly, Zuo De laughed aloud again.

It was hard to tell whether he had truly been joking or had originally intended to rest and only changed his tune after seeing Ai Ou's displeased expression.

Although Zuo De held a noble position, Ai Ou's standing was not low either, so he naturally could not ignore the other's feelings.

"Heh heh, Master, if you feel tired you can rest for a few days, it's no big deal—after all, we've waited this long, there's no rush," Ai Ou replied quickly, not one to leave the other an embarrassing exit, and his words—both overt and implied—sent a clear message: he'd been waiting a long time!

"Saving people is more important!" Zuo De waved a hand and said decisively.

"Then thank you very much, Master." Ai Ou visibly relaxed and his expression eased.

"Zhan Yuan pays respects to his benefactor; the benefactor truly is kind-hearted—tiring himself on the road yet putting saving others first, a model for our generation; Zhan Yuan admires you greatly!" The hawk-nosed man pushed through the crowd to stand not far from Zuo De and launched a stream of sycophantic praise as if it cost nothing.

Zuo De glanced at him, appearing a little puzzled, but soon smiled: "So it's you! Hm, you're already an Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemist—progressing nicely, keep at it."

Receiving such praise, Zhan Yuan's face lit up as if he'd eaten an entire pot of honey, and he said, "If not for the benefactor's guidance back then, Zhan Yuan could never have achieved what I have today; benefactor, please accept Zhan Yuan's bow!"

As he spoke, he bowed solemnly all the way to the ground, utterly reverent.

Zuo De nodded and said, "You're quite good. Back then I merely saw you frustrated and gave a few casual pointers; I didn't expect you'd remember them to this day. If you wish, come stay by my side from now on—I'm a bit short on an assistant."

"Willing! Willing! Thank you, benefactor, disciple will follow closely by your side!" Zhan Yuan rejoiced, speaking without cease.

Though he was only an Origin-Grade Middle-Level alchemist, being Zuo De's assistant was by no means shameful—such tasks were jobs others begged for and could not get—yet simply by stepping forward and speaking a few words to Zuo De he had obtained this enviable post.

Moreover, Zuo De's words amounted to recognition of him as a disciple, a status far more valuable than any other benefit.

Among Origin-Grade alchemists he could only be considered average; but in future, carrying the title of Master Zuo De's disciple, his status would be entirely different. Below Void King-Grade alchemists, anyone who encountered him would have to behave politely.

In an instant, Zhan Yuan was so delighted he nearly jumped for joy.

Several Origin-Grade alchemists cast envious glances at Zhan Yuan.

To be able to stand at Zuo De's side—even as an assistant—felt like an opportunity to learn many valuable things; perhaps with enough fate and comprehension one could become the next Zuo De!

Who wouldn't envy such good fortune?

After his happiness had lasted a while, Zhan Yuan suddenly stepped forward again with a conspiratorial air and bent low to whisper something to Zuo De.

His words were pressed very low, nearly inaudible; before Master Zuo De, no one dared use Divine Sense to eavesdrop, so no one knew what he was saying.

Yet after a moment, Zuo De casually swept his gaze toward where Yang Kai stood, and everyone immediately understood—Zhan Yuan, newly elated, was now speaking ill of Yang Kai.

Instantly, one after another, they cast looks of sympathy at Yang Kai!

Everyone knew that Yang Kai's future would likely be bleak. He had offended a Void King-Grade alchemist; no one in the world would provide him with pills. Void King-Grade experts find advancement extremely difficult—without Spiritual Pills to assist, progress would be minimal; perhaps he would remain forever at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

What a pity—once a talent of the age, who might have broken through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and stood atop the Star Domain; now his prospects seemed prematurely ended.

Many alchemists wore expressions of regret.

Over there, Zuo De's eyes narrowed as he glanced at Yang Kai a few times, then withdrew his gaze as if giving him no thought at all.

Zhan Yuan jabbered on and on, as if never to finish; Ai Ou's face was troubled but he could not urge him, and had to wait patiently.

As he had said earlier—having waited this long, why rush now?

Besides, with Zhan Yuan now barely counting as half a disciple of Master Zuo De, suddenly rising to such heights, Ai Ou would grant a little face.

After a long while, Zhan Yuan finally wore a flattering smile and fell silent.

Zuo De nodded slightly, his expression kindly.

Ai Ou interjected at the right moment, "Master, please come inside!"

"Hm." Zuo De responded; with Zuo Ling's assistance he stepped into the main hall, and when he came beside Ai Ou he gestured; Ai Ou understood and immediately walked shoulder-to-shoulder with Zuo De.

Others followed behind in a scattered fashion.

"Chairman Ai Ou, I came to Shuitian City this time firstly to refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill for Madam Gu, and secondly because there's another matter requiring your consent," Zuo De said as they walked.

"If Master needs anything, just say it—whatever the Hengluo Commerce Guild can do we will not refuse," Ai Ou said earnestly.

"Heh heh, don't speak so absolutely—I'm afraid you won't be willing when it comes to the point," Zuo De smiled faintly.

Ai Ou boasted proudly, "The Hengluo Commerce Guild's business spans the world; though I won't claim we're the richest, if we couldn't satisfy the Master's request, what right would we have to host you as a Guest Elder?"

"Since Chairman Ai Ou speaks so, I won't beat about the bush." Zuo De halted his steps and pondered for a moment, then said, "I came this time to propose for my granddaughter."

He indicated Zuo Ling, who was supporting him.

"Propose?" Ai Ou felt a sudden jolt of unease and involuntarily scanned Xue Yue, forcing a dry laugh: "Miss Zuo Ling is the Master's legitimate granddaughter, of noble status and blessed with peerless beauty—what lucky scamp in the Hengluo Commerce Guild is so fortunate to win Miss Zuo Ling's favor?"

"Chairman Ai Ou, don't pretend ignorance." Zuo De smiled proudly. "There aren't many people in the world fit for Ling'er, but in the Hengluo Commerce Guild there is one, and Ling'er has known him since childhood and is in love with him. When she heard I was coming to Shuitian City she stubbornly followed me here and forced me to come propose—if I refused she'd set my beard on fire... Ah, that girl has truly been spoiled by me."

Zuo De wore an expression of distress.

"Grandpa!" Zuo Ling flushed red and shyly tugged Zuo De's sleeve, though her beautiful eyes furtively gauged Xue Yue's reaction; now that things had reached this point, even a fool could understand what it meant—she wanted to know how Xue Yue would respond.

But upon looking, Zuo Ling's heart fell, for she found Xue Yue was pale-faced and appeared quite at a loss.

Could Brother Xue Yue not like me? Zuo Ling wondered suspiciously.

"You mean... Xue Yue?" Ai Ou could not feign ignorance.

These words revealed an important truth: if Xue Yue could wed Zuo Ling, Zuo De would effectively become part of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, living permanently in Shuitian City and refining pills for the guild.

If urgent matters arose, there would be no need to travel all the way to fetch him.

For any power or any martial artist, this was an enormous temptation. If Xue Yue were truly a man, Ai Ou would likely not hesitate and would agree outright.

Compared to his son's future happiness, a Void King-Grade alchemist was undoubtedly far more important.

But Xue Yue happened to be a woman!

This made the matter impossible to arrange.

Even if Ai Ou agreed now, once the bedchamber day exposed the truth, he would surely offend Zuo De utterly.

Thus he found himself trapped and for the first time felt powerless.

"What is it? Does Chairman Ai Ou have some reservations?"

Zuo De had assumed that by proposing in person Ai Ou would give him face, especially since he still had needs to ask of the guild; yet after speaking he did not receive the eager response he expected—Ai Ou instead looked embarrassed.

This displeased Zuo De, and his tone cooled considerably.

"Not at all, not at all, Master, you've misunderstood." Ai Ou hastily waved his hand, realizing that if today's matter was not handled carefully it could lead to immense trouble.

But for a moment he could not find a suitable excuse and stood there stunned.

Zuo De snorted coldly and said, "I have come today to propose; the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill will be my token of sincerity. If Chairman Ai Ou agrees to this match, I will from now on refine ten bottles of Void King‑Grade Spiritual Pills for the Hengluo Commerce Guild each year!"

A collective gasp of astonishment rose—everyone stared at Zuo De.

Ten bottles—that was one hundred Spiritual Pills.

If they were ordinary pills it would be one thing, but these were one hundred Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills! Each one was priceless; even an alchemist like Zuo De could not produce them casually.

Everyone immediately understood that this girl Zuo Ling held an immense place in Zuo De's heart, for otherwise he could never offer such rich terms.

Ai Ou's heart pounded violently; though secretly thrilled, he was also furious.

In past years, whenever the Hengluo Commerce Guild requested Void King-Grade pills from Zuo De they had to provide vast material compensation and hope he was in a good mood and had the time; even so, the guild obtained only about twenty Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills a year from him.

In the leanest years they had received as few as five!

Yet now this old man was offering one hundred each year as if it were effortless—Ai Ou knew well he had been hiding his true ability before.

This infuriated him; he felt that all the Hengluo Commerce Guild's offerings to the Master Elders over the years had been squandered.
