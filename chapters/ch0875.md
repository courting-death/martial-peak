## Chapter 875 — Flourishing

"My lord, have the arrangements been finalized?" On the way back, Li Rong asked softly.

"Yes. The Great Lord was reasonable and is willing to honor the previous agreement," Yang Kai nodded.

"That's good!" Li Rong seemed to breathe a sigh of relief and followed Yang Kai step for step, pursing her lips as if she wanted to say something but hesitated.

Sensing her oddness, Yang Kai smiled. "If there's anything you want to ask, ask freely. Don't be constrained."

Since leaving the Small Xuan Realm, he had noticed that the Ancient Demon Clan's attitude toward him had shifted; they were more respectful, more obedient, and more ready to follow orders than before.

Their attitude had, invisibly, elevated Yang Kai's standing within the Ancient Demon Clan.

That made Yang Kai somewhat uncomfortable.

"I was just thinking—have we brought you a lot of trouble?" Li Rong offered an apologetic smile. "The hatred between humans and demons runs deep. Now that we follow you, we're bound to attract unnecessary incidents. Those human experts who followed us here are proof—if they truly came to blows with us today, regardless of victory or defeat, you'd surely become the target of everyone's condemnation..."

"That's the price of commanding your strength; you need not overthink it," Yang Kai shook his head. "Besides, I don't care how others see me. Those helpful to me are my friends; anyone who dares harm me is my enemy. It's simple. The feud between humans and demons has nothing to do with me."

Li Rong's bright eyes revealed quiet surprise at how magnanimous Yang Kai's view was.

Even within the Ancient Demon Clan, sealed in the Small Xuan Realm for millennia, there was a deep-rooted distrust of outsiders: if not of our kind, their hearts must differ. Naturally, members gazed at kin and outsiders differently.

But with Yang Kai, there was little sense of racial distinction.

He accepted the Ancient Demon Clan, fraternized with the Great Yao Lord of the yao, and treated those yao experts as brothers—apparently without reservation, which continually amazed Li Rong.

"Rest assured, my lord. Once things settle, I and the other leaders will restrain our people, preventing conflicts with the original residents of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, and we will not cause you embarrassment," Li Rong pledged.

"No need to be so formal. To me, you are my people, and those from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land are too — I'll keep the balance myself."

"Thank you, my lord," Li Rong said with faint gratitude.

Yang Kai held no prejudice against them for being demons. Li Rong secretly felt the Ancient Demon Clan had found a good master.

Returning once more to the temporary encampment of the Ancient Demon Clan, Yang Kai informed several leaders that he could only take control of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land in a fortnight, and asked them to arrange for the clan to remain here for two weeks before preparing to enter the Nine Peaks.

The leaders accepted the order and went to make arrangements.

Staying here for half a month posed no problem; the Ancient Demon Clan had only recently returned to the world. Every place was new and curious to them, so it was a good chance to explore and become familiar with the surroundings.

After all, they might have to live in the Nine Peaks for a long time later on.

Groups of Ancient Demons were dispatched in threes and fives to scout the area.

Those remaining began building simple shelters, foraging for food, and working busily.

The place brimmed with life and prosperity.

Soft footsteps approached from the side. Yang Kai, seated under a tree, turned to see Wu Jie in a black robe striding over.

When he drew near, Wu Jie inclined his head slightly. "Saint Lord!"

"Where are the Netherworld Sect disciples?" Yang Kai asked; he hadn't noticed their presence earlier.

"I've had the deputy sect master take them back first. They will deliver some supplies later," Wu Jie replied.

"Much obliged."

"Saint Lord, you're too polite," Wu Jie smiled. "We're neighbors now; trivial matters are nothing to fuss over."

After a pause, Wu Jie asked, "How do you intend to handle the matters of Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall?"

"What do you think?" Yang Kai countered.

Wu Jie pondered, then spoke seriously: "Although Zhang Ao and Cao Guan perished in the endless snow mountains and the Saint Realm experts in those two forces suffered heavy losses, they still have disciples. Each sect has no small number—three to four thousand. These three to four thousand lack many masters but are the foundation of their sects."

"To kill them all..."

Wu Jie was taken aback, his face paling.

Yang Kai smiled and continued, "...is impractical. Driving them away isn't ideal either; they might wander nearby and cause trouble."

"You're right, Saint Lord," Wu Jie nodded in agreement. "Moreover, they likely don't yet know that Zhang Ao and Cao Guan have died. If they learn of it, internal chaos will break out, and then it will be an irreparable mess."

"Tell me your plan," Yang Kai said, watching him.

"My suggestion is to absorb them. Two sects with so many disciples must have some talented individuals who, if cultivated, could become powerful pillars in future."

"Absorb them... that could work. Handle it as you see fit," Yang Kai waved his hand.

Wu Jie was astonished. "Won't you intervene personally?"

"I'm not interested in those people, and since I'm leading a group of demons, it's inappropriate for me to step forward now," Yang Kai said with an amused, weighty chuckle. "Sect Master Wu can use this chance to strengthen the Netherworld Sect. Absorb those who can be absorbed; drive off those who can't. Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall are decent forces and must have storerooms inside."

Wu Jie's expression stirred; after thinking, he clasped his fists with excitement. "Thank you, Saint Lord, for your support!"

The three forces near the Nine Heavens Sacred Land had long survived by relying on it. Poxuan Palace was the strongest—Zhang Ao had cultivation at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm—followed by the War Soul Hall, with the Netherworld Sect at the bottom.

Now Wu Jie had been handed a once-in-a-millennium opportunity—how could he not be thrilled?

There were no experts left in those two sects to oppose him. As the head of a sect, if he could not handle this, all his Saint Realm cultivation would be for naught.

Wu Jie already pictured the Netherworld Sect growing by absorbing the other two forces' resources.

Excitement gave way to wistful gratitude.

If not for Zhang Ao's and Cao Guan's own misdeeds, would Wu Jie have had this chance? He felt following Yang Kai promised great prospects despite the short time and his own lack of contribution.

Fired up, Wu Jie declared he'd return immediately to deal with it and invited Yang Kai to visit the Netherworld Sect for a few days.

Since they would stay here for half a month anyway, he naturally wanted to use the opportunity to curry favor with Yang Kai.

Yang Kai politely declined his invitation.

"Your sect is only a few hundred li from here. I'll go when I feel like it. Not now," Yang Kai said, looking over the busy Ancient Demon Clan; leaving them now didn't seem wise.

Wu Jie didn't press; he excused himself and departed.

A day later, the Netherworld Sect disciples returned with a large quantity of supplies—enough for a thousand people to live here for half a month.

Li Rong and the others were pleased with Wu Jie's goodwill.

Tents rose among the trees, Ancient Demons settled in curious little groups, and every day was filled with activity.

In the largest tent, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on a thick fur rug, sinking his mind into his Sea of Consciousness to methodically refine the fragment of soul energy that had belonged to Zhang Ao.

Two months earlier, after Zhang Ao's death, the World-Ending Demon Eye had drawn out his soul energy, and Yang Kai had set it aside in a special corner.

Yang Kai mainly wanted to probe his memories and see what Zhang Ao had said before death about the starry sky's secrets.

Without using the World-Ending Demon Eye to purify the energy, Yang Kai cautiously drew on it with his Divine Sense, peering bit by bit.

A person's remaining soul energy carries the experiences of their life and all their emotions. If left unattended, it would soon dissipate into the world.

Of course, some strong souls are sturdy enough to persist long enough to find a suitable body and possess it.

Such soul energy is complex and dangerous; even masters of Divine Sense dared not casually read others' minds for fear their own nature and memories would be affected, possibly warping their own thoughts.

Yang Kai, possessing the Divine Sense Fire, dared to do this.

He still had to be cautious, preventing Zhang Ao's memories from influencing him; at the first sign of such intrusion he'd cut it off immediately.

Scene after scene from Zhang Ao's life flashed before Yang Kai's inner sight.

The memories were fragmented and disjointed; Yang Kai skimmed them without dwelling.

Divine Sense drained quickly, forcing Yang Kai to rest roughly every two hours.

After fully recovering, he continued his probing.

Only after five days did he finally glean from the scattered recollections a glimpse of the starry sky's secret.

Through the haze he saw a jagged stone forest with upright pillars rising from grass-covered ground; it was here Zhang Ao had found many odd stones.

The Blood Essence Stone had also been discovered by him in that place.

In Yang Kai's vision, Zhang Ao seemed to have done something; an entrance to a Void Passage opened, and after hesitating he plunged in.

The next moment he stood within a vast starry sky, the stars scattered around, and the terrifying force of the void pressed against Yang Kai so intensely he could almost feel it.

But when Yang Kai tried to probe further, the scene inexplicably cut off.

His consciousness returned. Yang Kai sighed—though he couldn't pinpoint where that stone forest lay, it should be within Poxuan Palace; a little investigation would reveal the truth.

With a movement of his mind, the World-Ending Demon Eye opened and a golden light shot forth, utterly purifying Zhang Ao's soul energy.
