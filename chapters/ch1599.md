## Chapter 1599 — One Must Not Judge a Person by Appearance

Among the three, a middle-aged elder in a brown robe kept glancing around, and in a low voice he asked Qian Tong.

"No." Qian Tong slowly shook his head and answered with grave concern, "I don't know where they went — the Transmission Compass can't contact them at all. What about Deputy City Lord Ning? Have you reached him?"

The middle-aged elder sighed deeply: "Can't reach him either; I have no idea where Brother Ning went."

They exchanged a look and both saw the anxiety and helplessness reflected in the other's eyes.

The middle-aged elder was the lord of Lushui City on Cuiwei Star. When Yang Kai left Cuiwei Star and returned to the Tongxuan Continent, Qian Tong and his party of five stayed behind to prepare for the Blood Prison Trial in the years to come.

The Lushui City lord knew how to treat people well; upon learning Qian Tong and the others had arrived, he earnestly invited them to serve as Honored Guest Elders of Lushui City. To avoid misunderstandings and because they needed a place to stay, Qian Tong and the others readily agreed.

Over these years, they had gotten along fairly pleasantly and there had been no rifts or friction.

When the Blood Prison Trial began, they, along with the middle-aged elder and the deputy city lord Ning, entered the Blood Prison.

All of them were experts at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; they had entered to comprehend the marvels of Domains in hopes of glimpsing the mysteries of the Void King Realm. Naturally, seven people could not travel together.

So they scattered.

A few days ago the middle-aged elder heard news that a Domain Stone Mountain had appeared, and immediately used the Transmission Compass to contact his companions, but only Qian Tong and Lin Yurao arrived. Yang Xiuzhu, Chu Hanyi, Mo Yu of the Qiantian Sect, and the deputy city lord Ning were all without word.

Seeing more people arriving here and the situation growing tense, Qian Tong and the other two present were naturally extremely anxious.

Without absolute strength and sufficient numbers, they could not hold the ground they occupied.

Not far off, later-arriving martial artists who had failed to seize a good position looked toward them with ill intent, but there were too few of them — only two — so they naturally would not act rashly.

Yet those two were frequently pouring Divine Sense into their Transmission Compass, seemingly attempting to reach someone.

If they summoned reinforcements, the situation would become worrying.

"Elder Lin, any response on your side?" the middle-aged elder again turned his expectant gaze to Lin Yurao.

She slowly shook her head; her lovely eyes were full of worry. "No response either."

"What are we to do?" the middle-aged elder asked, anxious and uneasy. A heaven-sent opportunity lay before him; he had no time or chance to cultivate into it and could only wait here — a state more unbearable than death.

"Wait another half day; if Elder Yang and the others still don't arrive, we... we will leave!" the middle-aged elder ground his teeth and barked.

Although Domain Stone Mountain was a heaven-sent chance, he did not wish to lose his life here. This place was calm for the moment, but would not remain so for long; it would surely descend into chaos as many martial artists fought viciously over positions.

"Leave..." Qian Tong's face flickered, his eyes full of reluctance.

No one from Dark Star longed to peer into the Void King Realm's secrets more than he did.

Had Yang Kai not taken him from Dark Star and brought him here, he would never have escaped the constraints of that world's laws and would have had no chance to touch higher levels of the Martial Dao in his lifetime.

Yang Kai had given him this chance; now that a greater opportunity lay before him, he naturally would not be willing to leave.

"Ah..." Just as he brooded, Qian Tong's expression changed and he poured his Divine Sense into the Transmission Compass in his hand.

"Has someone arrived?" the Lushui City lord, seeing Qian Tong's altered expression, asked with delight.

Lin Yurao's expression shifted as well; her beautiful eyes shone as she looked toward Qian Tong.

Qian Tong gave no reply and continued to probe the Transmission Compass; after a while he laughed aloud: "Yes, someone's coming."

"Who is it? Elder Yang? Elder Chu? Or Elder Mo?"

"None of them," Qian Tong slowly shook his head.

"None of them? Could it be Brother Ning?" the Lushui City lord's expression stirred. "Brother Ning coming would be fine; his strength is not weak."

"Not Brother Ning either."

"Then who?" the Lushui City lord was stupefied. Qian Tong's party consisted of five people; now two were here and the newcomer was not one of the remaining three — this left him baffled.

Lin Yurao also wore a puzzled expression and looked at Qian Tong with suspicion, not understanding his meaning.

Qian Tong chuckled and glanced at Lin Yurao. "Yang Kai has come!"

Lin Yurao's eyes brightened and she cried out in delighted surprise, "The Sect Master has come? How could he be here? Didn't he return to his homeland?"

"I'm surprised too," Qian Tong laughed, his old heart greatly relieved. "He may have returned in time — when he left Cuiwei Star he did say that if time permitted he might come back."

"Elder Qian, are you sure? Are you certain that response was the Sect Master's?"

"How could I be mistaken?" Qian Tong shook his head repeatedly. "Though I'm a bit older, I'm not so muddled as to be wrong about this."

"That's wonderful." Lin Yurao leapt up, radiating joy. "With the Sect Master here, matters will be much easier."

The two of them spoke with obvious reverence for Yang Kai. Though the Lushui City lord did not know who Yang Kai was, their expressions made clear that a formidable ally had arrived.

The tense mood relaxed and he smiled, looking at Lin Yurao. "Elder Lin, could you briefly tell me about your Sect Master? I have never met him; I mustn't be rude when we meet."

The middle-aged elder was well aware of Lin Yurao's strength; she was certainly stronger than he.

Not only Lin Yurao, but Qian Tong's party of five also seemed far stronger than ordinary practitioners at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Their grasp of situation was unusually deep and their Saint Yuan was extremely vigorous and dense.

At first the middle-aged elder did not understand why; after prolonged contact he learned that the cultivation star they came from had a strange heavenly law constraint that prevented them from ascending to the Void King Realm, forcing them to toil within the Origin Returning Realm.

Therefore they could refine themselves to exceedingly high levels within the Origin Returning Realm, surpassing other cultivation stars' practitioners at the same Stage.

There is reason behind every sip and every morsel.

For someone like Lin Yurao—an expert of her caliber—to address another as Sect Master, that person must surely surpass her in strength. Most likely, they already have one foot stepped into the Void King Realm!

The Lushui City lord naturally thought so.

The arrival of such a powerful helper filled the Lushui City lord with joy.

Lin Yurao's face could not help but show a trace of awkwardness, an odd expression as if some things were hard to put into words.

"Heh — hard to explain. You'll know when you see him, Brother Zhao," Qian Tong said with a laugh, as if mere words could not capture Yang Kai; he could not be gauged by ordinary logic.

"Very well!" the middle-aged elder nodded lightly and did not press the matter; they would meet soon, so there was no point in dwelling on it now.

"But Brother Zhao, I must tell you in advance: this Sect Master Yang is not to be judged by appearance!" Qian Tong casually admonished.

"Not to be judged by appearance?" the Lushui City lord frowned, puzzled, not understanding what Qian Tong meant.

"He's here!" Qian Tong's expression shifted and he suddenly cried out, looking in a certain direction.

The Lushui City lord immediately perked up and prepared himself to greet that powerful ally in the best possible state.

A figure hurtled in from the far distance at incredible speed.

When Qian Tong spoke the figure was still a tiny dark dot on the horizon, but within three breaths a tall, handsome youth suddenly appeared not far in front of Domain Stone Mountain.

"Yang Kai, over here!" Qian Tong called loudly.

Countless martial artists around Domain Stone Mountain glared at him angrily.

Qian Tong could not help but give a dry laugh, realizing he had been too conspicuous; he quickly toned down his demeanor.

When Yang Kai arrived he first cast a glance at the huge Domain Stone Mountain, surprise flickering in his eyes, then shifted his form and came before Qian Tong and the others, greeting warmly: "Elder Qian, Elder Lin!"

"Greetings, Sect Master!" Lin Yurao hurriedly saluted.

Yang Kai waved his hand to indicate she needn't be so formal, and asked in puzzlement, "Why are only the two of you here? Where are the others?"

"We can't contact them, we don't know where they went," Qian Tong said helplessly. "Did you return from your homeland?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded.

"You're back — that's a relief, that's a relief. You arrived just in time for the Blood Prison Trial; I was worried you might not make it," Qian Tong laughed.

"Being able to come here was luck," Yang Kai replied casually and said no more.

He truly was lucky; he had only gone to Di Chen to see Shan Qingluo and had not expected to arrive from Di Chen at the Blood Prison.

As he spoke he glanced at the Lushui City lord with a quizzical look: "This is... ?"

"Oh — I forgot to introduce you. This is Zhao Tianze, the Lushui City lord, Brother Zhao. Brother Zhao, this is the Yang Kai I mentioned."

Zhao Tianze stared at Yang Kai, his expression peculiarly strange.

From the moment Yang Kai appeared he scrutinized the newcomer closely.

After all, Qian Tong and Lin Yurao's conversation had greatly elevated Yang Kai's supposed strength and status, and Zhao Tianze had set high expectations for his arrival.

He assumed the newcomer would be a top expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

He expected the newcomer to be far superior to Qian Tong and Lin Yurao.

But on meeting him, Zhao Tianze found something amiss.

The man who arrived was a seemingly young youth — that would be one thing — but what baffled him was that the energy fluctuations emanating from him measured only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Zhao Tianze almost thought he had misread it; he repeatedly swept Yang Kai with his Divine Sense, several times, before finally confirming that the man truly was only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

He was so exasperated he nearly coughed up blood.
