## Chapter 900 — Demon Script

The Beast Sea Great Forest — Yang Kai arrived here for the second time.

Caidie led the way without a word, her seven-colored wings beating like streaks of lightning.

Yang Kai followed behind at an unhurried pace, showing no sign of strain.

This surprised Caidie. Though she had deliberately slowed her speed to accommodate Yang Kai, who was a Transcendent Realm cultivator, she herself was at the Second Stage of the Saint Realm.

When she saw Yang Kai keeping up without much effort, she gradually increased her speed, wanting to reach Thundertree Palace earlier so the Great Lord wouldn’t be kept waiting.

Even when she was nearly flying at full force, Yang Kai still managed to keep pace.

Caidie’s heart trembled, but her nature was icy and composed; her expression remained unchanged as she kept her head down and continued to guide the way.

This kid... is a little strange, Caidie thought. A typical Third Stage Transcendent should never be able to match her speed, yet he had.

No wonder he could become the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and subdue so many demon experts.

At first she’d assumed he was just lucky, but only now did Caidie realize he truly had some real ability.

They sped onward.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, continuously scanning their surroundings.

His movements didn’t escape Li Rong’s observation; she quietly sent a message through Divine Sense: "Lord, have you noticed anything suspicious?"

"Mm." Yang Kai replied. "There’s something odd about the aura here."

"If there’s danger, we shouldn’t go," Li Rong said, growing anxious.

Yang Kai let out a short laugh. "It’s not a dangerous aura. I just feel that this trip to the Beast Sea Great Forest is slightly different from the last, but I can’t put my finger on exactly what’s changed..."

Indeed, an aura flowed through the air that unsettled Yang Kai and made him pay attention, but probing it deeply offered no clear starting point.

"Don’t worry too much. The Great Lord is easy to get along with and trusting. The changes here are probably related to why he asked for me; we’ll see once we get there."

"Oh." Li Rong said no more but still reminded him, "If there really is danger, Lord, don’t stray too far from me."

"Mm, mm!" Yang Kai kept agreeing.

He now had many methods at his disposal: he could tear space, wield the Flying Shuttle, wore Wind-and-Thunder Wings, possessed high-grade Secret Treasures, could transform into a dragon, and even perform the Demon God Transformation. It wasn’t easy for ordinary people to harm him. Unless struck unexpectedly and rendered immobile, even amid thousands of warriors he was confident he could escape.

He didn’t take Li Rong’s warning too seriously.

They dashed along and within two or three days arrived before the towering Thundertree Palace.

Upon arrival, Yang Kai discovered numerous yao experts had gathered there, crouched or crawling and enclosing the area several layers deep. Many shapeshifters stood on the trunk, eyes closed in meditation.

"This is Thundertree Palace?" Li Rong stared at the enormous ancient tree, her beautiful eyes filled with astonishment.

Yang Kai, like the first time he came, was struck dumb by the tree.

To have grown so massive, the tree’s age must be ten thousand years, maybe far older.

The ancient tree brimmed with thunder’s essence, occasionally sparking arcs of lightning, extraordinarily pure. The yao experts standing on the trunk were unfazed and turned their gazes toward Yang Kai and Li Rong.

Each offered a slight nod as a sign of goodwill.

The last time Yang Kai had come, he’d resolved the issue of the Huasheng Pool and won their unanimous approval.

"Follow me." Caidie flashed upward and flew higher.

Yang Kai and Li Rong quickly followed.

Inside the treehouse that stood among the clouds, Yang Kai met the Great Lord.

The last time he’d seen him was also in this treehouse.

The Great Lord grinned broadly to welcome Yang Kai and motioned for him to sit and speak.

They sat across a small table, Yang Kai facing the Great Lord, with Caidie standing behind one and Li Rong behind the other.

"Didn’t you bring some cultivation supplies for my yao?" the Great Lord asked with a beaming smile.

"Our crystal stone vein is almost exhausted from your mining; you probably don’t need those for now, right?" Yang Kai rolled his eyes. The yao had been running rampant in the Sacred Land for years, plundering that vein without restraint.

Yang Kai was annoyed, feeling as if the yao had lifted a stone only to drop it on their own feet.

"Not needed now doesn’t mean we won’t need them later. Crystal Stones are always welcome. We yao don’t have many veins; we can’t compare to your human territories," the Great Lord said, slowly shaking his head. "Besides, I heard your Sacred Land has recently prospered and has so many crystal stones you don’t know what to do with them!"

“You even asked about that?” Yang Kai was speechless. “Those were Pills I made myself, one by one… Forget it, next time—when I come again, I’ll bring you some Crystal Stones and Pills.”

"Good, I’ll look forward to it," the Great Lord said, his eyes brightening; Yang Kai’s frankness made dealing with him easy.

“Great Lord, you specially called me over this time—what matter is it?” Yang Kai’s expression grew much more serious as he asked in a deep voice.

"There is indeed something," the Great Lord’s face turned grave. After a moment’s thought he asked, "Have you ever heard of a Void Passage?"

Yang Kai’s face darkened. "Are you mocking me?"

The Great Lord’s mouth twitched; he forced a dry laugh. "That’s a needless question—have you seen one yourself?"

Yang Kai nodded slightly. Though he couldn’t be certain about others, he felt he’d seen a considerable number of Void Passages.

"Then it’s easier to explain," the Great Lord continued. "Recently something strange happened in the Beast Sea Great Forest related to a Void Passage!"

Yang Kai stared at him intently, not intending to interrupt.

"About three to five days’ travel from Thundertree Palace, an especially unstable Void Passage entrance suddenly appeared! I’ve seen Void Passages before — when I was young I even entered a Small Xuan Realm. But the one that appeared in the Beast Sea Great Forest is very different from what I once saw..."

"Different how?" Yang Kai asked.

"Huge, and it gives one a very eerie feeling," the Great Lord said solemnly. "Its appearance seems to have altered the entire forest’s atmosphere. Didn’t you notice it on your way here?"

"I noticed something, but I didn’t know why."

"It’s because of that!" the Great Lord nodded. "Usually a Void Passage entrance is extremely hidden and seldom discovered. Even if opened, it closes on its own soon after. But that Void Passage’s entrance appeared abruptly and, though unstable, hasn’t shown signs of closing."

"Oh? That is odd indeed."

"That spot lies at the border between my domain and that of another Great Lord of the yao, the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox. After the Void Passage appeared we investigated together..."

"Earth-Splitting Divine Ox?" Yang Kai exclaimed with a strange look.

"You know him?" the Great Lord asked suspiciously.

Yang Kai shook his head. "I don’t know him. But I did learn a martial skill related to him."

With that, he casually released a long-unused Beast Soul Technique.

Accompanied by the roars and bellows of beasts, golden tiger and ox sigils of imposing splendor suddenly appeared.

The treehouse instantly grew scorching hot.

The two beast souls were formed entirely from refined True Yuan and seemed to possess considerable awareness. Their eyes rolled vividly, lifelike.

The Great Lord was startled and hastily waved his hand to spread a protective cover over the treehouse, lest the ancient tree be scorched.

"Heaven-Shaking White Tiger and Earth-Splitting Divine Ox?" Caidie and the Great Lord cried in surprise, staring at Yang Kai.

"A Beast Soul Technique I cultivated long ago," Yang Kai explained.

"This is no common Beast Soul Technique... this truly has a soul!" the Great Lord exclaimed, pondering, "Have you ever seen the remains of these two demonic beasts?"

"Yes. They seemed to have fought a great battle and perished together, leaving only their Inner Cores. When I absorbed the power from those Inner Cores, I witnessed scenes of their ancient fight and learned this martial skill."

"That explains it," the Great Lord nodded with a sigh. "Genuine Beast Soul Techniques with souls always come from powerful demonic beasts whose wills persist after death, condensing into essence for someone to obtain. The remains you saw must have been our predecessors — what a pity... The Heaven-Shaking White Tiger and the Earth-Splitting Divine Ox both belonged to noble lineages among the yao, on par with me. But the rarer the lineage, the fewer their numbers. The White Tiger clan seems extinct, and the old ox’s clan is down to him alone. The same is true on my side."

Hearing the Great Lord’s words, Yang Kai finally understood the rarity of the Beast Soul Technique. Having seldom used it, he now found that with his growing strength it had become quite destructive.

"Enough of that, let’s get to the point," the Great Lord said, recovering from his melancholy. "We, and the followers of the old ox, recklessly probed the Void Passage and lost quite a few men... Eventually the old ox and I both entered, but even together we couldn’t unravel its mysteries."

"It’s that difficult?" Yang Kai asked, astonished.

"Beyond imagination. And we found very ancient script there. You know we yao have no written language."

"Was it human script?"

The Great Lord shook his head and said in a low voice, "It was Demon Script!"

Yang Kai’s brow lifted, and Li Rong behind him showed interest as well.

"The old ox and I couldn’t make sense of it and dared not act rashly. He’s guarding it now; I came to fetch reinforcements."

"So you summoned me?" Yang Kai smiled faintly. "You weren’t after me — you wanted Li Rong, right?"

"You’re sharp. The strange force there makes even the old ox and me tread carefully. What can your power and cultivation do? It’s the lady behind you who’s the key to solving the puzzle."

As he spoke, his gaze fixed keenly on Li Rong.
