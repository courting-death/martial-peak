## Chapter 2420 — Only One Thing

“Brat, you really have a death wish!” Yao Zhuo was so furious that smoke nearly poured from his head, his Qi and blood surging in his chest. He was indeed seriously injured, but he was still at the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. For Yang Kai, a mere Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, to extort him so brazenly—how could he possibly endure it? His mood was agitated, and he wished he could step forward right now and slap Yang Kai to death.

 He didn't believe Yang Kai had another Emperor Extinction Pill. That pill was far too rare; for ordinary people to produce even one was already impressive, let alone a second.

“You still dare threaten me? Believe it or not, I’ll have you all die here!” Yang Kai’s expression turned fierce.

“Just you?” Yao Zhuo sneered, his face full of ridicule and mockery.

Yang Kai turned to look at Sun Yunxiu and stretched out his hand. “Give me back the token!”

Sun Yunxiu didn’t know what he was up to, but the token was indeed brought by Yang Kai, and he had just produced Bing Yun’s Emperor Extinction Pill, proving his deep connection with her master. So, without hesitation, Sun Yunxiu hurriedly held out the Ancestor’s Token with both hands and returned it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai raised the token high, swept his gaze around, and shouted, “According to Ice Heart Valley’s sect rules, seeing the Ancestor’s Token is as if seeing the Ancestor herself!”

An Ruoyun, Sun Yunxiu, and the others were all stunned at his words, but quickly realized that this was indeed a rule in the valley. They immediately knelt to the ground and said in unison, “Disciple greets the Ancestor!”

Yang Kai looked coldly at Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi, shouting sternly, “In the name of Senior Bing Yun, I order you—kill these two!”

Zzzt—

Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi’s faces changed dramatically. In shock, they retreated several steps, extremely wary.

A mere Yang Kai was nothing to them, but the Emperor Realm experts of Ice Heart Valley were a different story. There were more than a dozen Emperor Realm experts here, and two of them were Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. With Yao Zhuo gravely injured, he was no match for them at all.

If these women really obeyed the order, then this time next year would truly be his death anniversary.

The women of Ice Heart Valley were also stunned at the command, but Sun Yunxiu quickly darted out, leaping behind Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi to block their escape.

The other women, though feeling this was a bit improper, still spread out and surrounded the two from Wenqing Sect, each summoning their Secret Treasure, ready to strike at any moment.

Yao Zhuo’s face turned pale in an instant. Feng Xi trembled all over, swallowing nervously. As the Young Sect Master of Wenqing Sect, he had always lived in comfort and never faced such a situation. Now, at the brink of life and death, he finally understood what true fear was.

Yang Kai stood to the side, cackling strangely, tossing the Ancestor’s Token in his hand, looking every bit the petty villain who had gotten his way.

“Young Master…” An Ruoyun looked at Yang Kai and asked softly, “Do you really want to kill them?”

She truly didn’t want to kill Yao Zhuo and Feng Xi here. After all, their status was extraordinary. If they really died at Ice Heart Valley, Wenqing Sect would never let it go. If the two sects went to war, the entire Northern Territory would be plunged into misery. Even if her master returned, the sect would surely suffer heavy casualties.

As the acting Valley Lord, she couldn’t ignore these consequences. She feared Yang Kai would really order them to kill just to vent his anger.

If it really came to that, she would rather defy the Ancestor’s Token than obey. She believed even her master wouldn’t blame her for it.

Yang Kai chuckled lowly. “That depends on whether these two know what’s good for them.”

Hearing this, An Ruoyun felt relieved. She thought this young man wasn’t so stubborn after all. His order was clearly meant to squeeze some benefits from Yao Zhuo. Otherwise, he would have already urged them to act, not said such things.

As long as no one died, everything could be negotiated. With this thought, An Ruoyun stopped asking and instead became curious how far Yang Kai would push things.

“Valley Lord An, Elder Sun, you two are Emperor Realm experts. Are you really willing to be ordered around by some unknown brat? You have your own status—aren’t you afraid of being laughed at if word gets out?” Yao Zhuo, unable to reason with Yang Kai, could only try to appeal to An Ruoyun and Sun Yunxiu, hoping they would care about their reputations and not act so recklessly.

Sun Yunxiu said indifferently, “The Ancestor’s Token is here, we have no choice. If the Vice Sect Master has any objections, you can take it up with my master!”

Yao Zhuo was instantly silenced. Just one Emperor Extinction Pill from Bing Yun had nearly cost him his life—how could he dare argue with her in person?

Gritting his teeth so hard they nearly cracked, Yao Zhuo’s feelings were extremely complicated. In all his years of cultivation, he had never suffered such humiliation, threatened by a youth whose cultivation was far beneath his own.

But now, under someone else’s roof, he truly had no choice but to bow his head.

After a long silence, he could only swallow his anger and ask in a low voice, “What exactly do you want?”

Yang Kai grinned. “No need to be so nervous, Vice Sect Master. Everything in this world can be negotiated. Just offer a little compensation, and I can pretend nothing happened just now.”

“What do you want?” Yao Zhuo demanded.

Yang Kai raised a finger and said calmly, “I only want one thing!”

“Let’s hear it!” Yao Zhuo relaxed a little, thinking that if it was just one thing, maybe it could be negotiated.

 "Hand over your Spatial Ring and get lost!" Yang Kai squinted at the ring on his hand.

“What?” Yao Zhuo’s eyes blazed with fury. “Impossible!”

When Yang Kai said he only wanted one thing, Yao Zhuo thought he just wanted to save face and would ask for something trivial. But now, it was clear Yang Kai was just taking advantage of the situation.

Yao Zhuo’s Spatial Ring, belonging to a Second Stage Emperor Realm master, was packed with treasures. He had originally come here to prepare for Feng Xi and Ziyu’s wedding in two days, and all the betrothal gifts were stored inside that ring. Wenqing Sect was a major force in the Northern Territory, and for the Young Sect Master’s marriage, they would never be stingy—the value of those gifts alone could rival a mid-tier sect’s income for ten years, not to mention the countless rare treasures and precious artifacts within.

Yang Kai’s face darkened, and he said coldly, “Kill him. Start with the young one, but don’t let him die too quickly. Cut off his limbs one by one, destroy his Dantian—I want him to taste every torture before he dies!”

As soon as he finished, Sun Yunxiu’s sword trembled and slashed toward Feng Xi.

Feng Xi turned pale with fright, his whole body shaking as he screamed, “No!”

Sun Yunxiu was completely unmoved. This woman had a fiery temper—she hadn’t shown Yang Kai any courtesy before, and now, at his command, she really attacked without hesitation.

“Wait!” Yang Kai raised his hand again.

Sun Yunxiu’s sword instantly stopped, resting right on Feng Xi’s arm. The icy chill made Feng Xi go limp and collapse to the ground. Turning his head, he saw a thin line of blood on his arm. If Yang Kai had called out even a moment later, his arm would have been severed.

Yang Kai smiled at Feng Xi, looking gentle and harmless. “Young Sect Master, it seems you have something to say?”

“Yes, yes I do!” Feng Xi nodded repeatedly.

“Then speak. No one’s stopping you.”

Feng Xi opened his mouth, but didn’t know what to say. After a long while, he finally turned to Yao Zhuo and said, “Martial Uncle, just give him the ring. Why bother fighting him?”

“Nonsense!” Yao Zhuo roared. “We of Wenqing Sect would rather die standing than live kneeling! You want this Lord’s ring? That’s no different from slapping my face! Xi’er, don’t be afraid. This brat is just trying to scare you—he wouldn’t really dare take your life. If he did, when the Sect Master arrives in two days, he’ll flatten Ice Heart Valley!”

“Take my life…” Feng Xi muttered, his face turning deathly pale as terror surged in his heart. He had always been the one killing others—when had he ever faced death himself? In that moment, he forgot all about dignity and shouted, “No, I don’t want to die! If I die, what’s the point of my father flattening Ice Heart Valley? If I die, what about my sixty-nine wives? Martial Uncle, hurry and give him the ring! I’m the Young Sect Master of Wenqing Sect, I’m supposed to lead the sect and become a ruler of the Northern Territory—how can I die here?!”

“You…” Yao Zhuo never imagined Feng Xi would be so spineless, frightened out of his wits so easily. He hadn’t realized before how cowardly he was. Already injured, Yao Zhuo now coughed up a mouthful of blood, clearly furious and disappointed.

The women of Ice Heart Valley seemed to be seeing Feng Xi’s true colors for the first time, each showing looks of contempt. Even in a life-or-death crisis, his behavior was truly disgraceful.

 A martial artist's path is one where life is hanging by a thread, with life and death long since seen through. But Feng Xi had clearly been sheltered too much, so when danger came, he lost all composure. As the Young Sect Master of Wenqing Sect, he had utterly disgraced the sect.

Those contemptuous gazes made Feng Xi want to crawl into a hole, but compared to his life, what did dignity matter? He kept begging Yao Zhuo to take off the Spatial Ring.

 "Sixty-nine wives—Young Sect Master, you really are blessed. It makes one envious," Yang Kai said coldly, though his eyes held only mockery. "Don’t worry, Young Sect Master. If you die here, I’ll take good care of your sixty-nine wives for you. I have plenty of stamina—they won’t be left lonely."

An Ruoyun blushed and spat, “Young Master, must you be so shameless with your words?”

Zi Yu also gave Yang Kai a strange look, rolling her eyes.

Hearing Yang Kai set his sights on his sixty-nine wives, Feng Xi’s eyes turned red. Without caring about anything else, he reached out and yanked the Spatial Ring off Yao Zhuo’s hand.

Yao Zhuo, perhaps disheartened by Feng Xi’s behavior, didn’t resist at all, letting Feng Xi easily take the ring from him.
