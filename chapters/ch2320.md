## Chapter 2320 — Strength Is King

Over the next half day, Ghost Ancestor and the others also asked Yang Kai about what had happened to him after entering the Star Realm.

Yang Kai did not hide much and recounted his experiences in detail. Listening to him, Ghost Ancestor and the others felt a mix of anxiety and relief. Even though they knew Yang Kai would always find a way out of danger, they still couldn’t help but worry for him.

Only then did everyone realize that Yang Kai’s experiences over the past few years were far richer and more dangerous than theirs. Yet his growth had far surpassed theirs, making them feel somewhat ashamed, as if they were heroes past their prime.

After half a day, everyone dispersed to find rooms to rest and recover.

Yang Kai went to find Ye Qinghan and asked her to help gather a few medicinal ingredients.

Refining that special pill was not too difficult; Yang Kai simply lacked the materials. Otherwise, he could have set up a furnace and refined it right there on the ship. The ingredients were not hard to find, so Yang Kai could rest assured leaving it to Ye Qinghan.

She agreed without hesitation and immediately sent a message back to the sect.

The ship continued forward, and in just two days, they entered the heart of the Chiyue Mountains.

At one point, while Yang Kai was meditating, he suddenly felt the ship tremble. A buzzing sound followed, and the ship slowly came to a stop.

He opened his eyes, realizing they must have arrived. Just as this thought crossed his mind, there was a knock at the door, and Ye Qinghan’s voice sounded: “Young Master Yang, we’ve arrived.”

Yang Kai got up, opened the door, and smiled at Ye Qinghan, signaling for her to lead the way.

Soon, the two of them arrived on the deck. Ghost Ancestor and the disciples of Chiyue Sect were already gathered, as if only waiting for him.

When he appeared, Ghost Ancestor and the others all looked over and smiled at him.

“Father!” Ye Qinghan suddenly called out. She leaped off the ship and threw herself into an old man’s arms, hugging him tightly. She looked up and said, “Why did you come out?”

The old man looked quite advanced in years, with white hair, though his spirit was still decent. But his Qi and blood were clearly weakening; in other words, his martial path was on the decline. As time passed, his cultivation would only drop further, and his Qi and blood would grow weaker. If he could not advance to the Emperor Realm, he would fall within ten years.

The old man’s features bore a certain resemblance to Ye Qinghan’s.

Yang Kai immediately understood that this was Ye Hen, Sect Master of Chiyue Sect, and Ye Qinghan’s father.

Ye Hen smiled and gently patted Ye Qinghan’s shoulder. “With such honored guests arriving, of course I had to come out to greet them. But you—still acting like a child in front of your father at your age? You’ll make our guests laugh at you.”

Ye Qinghan wrinkled her nose and said, “Who says I’m not a child? I haven’t married yet.”

Ye Hen laughed heartily. “Then I’ll marry you off tomorrow.”

Ye Qinghan pouted. “You wouldn’t dare!”

As they spoke, Du Xian and the others also flew down from the ship, respectfully cupping their fists to Ye Hen. “Greetings, Sect Master.”

Ye Hen nodded. “You’ve worked hard.”

Du Xian said, “Sect Master, you overstate it. Serving the sect is our duty; we dare not claim credit.”

Ye Hen nodded in satisfaction, then turned his gaze to Yang Kai and the others. His eyes settled on Yang Kai, and he smiled, cupping his fists. “This must be Master Yang? Truly, so young and already a dragon among men.”

He had clearly already received plenty of information from Ye Qinghan and knew why she had brought Yang Kai to Chiyue Sect, so he was visibly excited, though he hid it well.

Yang Kai cupped his fists. "Junior Yang Kai greets Sect Master Ye!"
Yang Kai had always shown proper respect to elders and those of higher status, never allowing his growing strength to make him arrogant or dismissive.

“Master Yang, you’ve come all this way at great effort. I, Ye, am deeply grateful,” Ye Hen said solemnly.

Du Xian and the others were stunned, not knowing what the Sect Master was thanking him for. They all thought Ye Hen had misspoken and looked puzzled.

Ye Qinghan had not told them Yang Kai’s true purpose for this trip, so they naturally did not understand.

It wasn’t that Ye Qinghan didn’t trust them, but this matter concerned the future rise and fall of Chiyue Sect—the fewer who knew, the better.

“Sect Master Ye is too polite,” Yang Kai replied with a polite word, then shifted his gaze to another old man beside Ye Hen and asked curiously, “And this senior is…?”

This old man, dressed in black, had been standing silently beside Ye Hen, his gaze sharp, his cultivation at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, not much weaker than Ye Hen's. His Origin Qi was powerful and pure. While Yang Kai and Ye Hen spoke, this old man had simply watched coldly, showing no intention of greeting Yang Kai or even acknowledging him.

Still, since this man had such cultivation and stood beside Ye Hen, his status must be high, so Yang Kai asked out of courtesy.

Ye Hen frowned slightly, but soon smiled and began to introduce him. “This is…”

“I am Shi Cangying, Vice Sect Master of Chiyue Sect!” the black-robed old man interrupted, his gaze dark as he looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned, instinctively sensing hostility and rejection from this old man. He couldn’t help but study him more closely, certain he had never met him before, nor had any dealings with him. He was left puzzled, not knowing how he had offended him.

Ye Hen tried to smooth things over. “Vice Sect Master Shi is a pillar of our sect. Thanks to his support over the years, Chiyue Sect has managed to hold on.”

“So it’s Vice Sect Master Shi. Please forgive my rudeness,” Yang Kai said with a smile, not taking it to heart.

But Shi Cangying showed no intention of being polite. He just snorted coldly and turned to Ye Hen. “Sect Master, I thought you must be welcoming some peerless young genius, but it turns out he’s just an ordinary brat. How could you make such a fuss over him? Sect Master, you must be getting senile.”

These words not only belittled Yang Kai, but even insulted Ye Hen.

The atmosphere instantly became tense. The disciples of Chiyue Sect were all angry but dared not speak.

Ye Hen’s face was full of embarrassment. He clearly hadn’t expected Shi Cangying to be so tactless, saying such things right in front of Yang Kai and leaving everyone unable to save face.

Shi Cangying continued, “What’s more, these people just caused a huge scene at the City Lord’s mansion two days ago, offending Lord Luo and many guests. I heard they even killed Lord Ke of Heavenly Extreme Hall and seriously injured the Young Palace Master of Tianzhao Palace! If such violent people enter our Chiyue Sect, what then?”

Ye Hen frowned. “Brother Shi, things aren’t as you say. There’s more to the story…”

Shi Cangying said, “I know the whole story perfectly well. Lord Luo was just taking a concubine—what crime is that? Yet he was humiliated in front of so many guests! Sect Master, if you let these people into our sect, you’re inviting disaster! Tianhe City, Heavenly Extreme Hall, and Tianzhao Palace will never let this go, and Chiyue Sect cannot withstand them!”

At these words, Ye Hen’s expression changed slightly. Clearly, he was wary of these powers.

Ghost Ancestor let out a sinister laugh, black mist swirling around him, his eyes like ghostly flames as he stared at Shi Cangying. “So, you think we were wrong? Luo Jin wanted to take my Fifth Sister as a concubine, and we should have just gone along with it, feeling honored instead of ashamed?”

Shi Cangying looked at him coldly. “Strength is everything. With your meager cultivation, being able to rely on the City Lord’s mansion is your good fortune, but you didn’t know how to appreciate it and instead brought disaster upon yourselves. Laughable.”

“You old bastard, what nonsense!” Chi Yue’s face flushed with anger as she cursed, “Why don’t you marry off your wife and daughter to that old dog and rely on his tree, instead of making others do it?”

Shi Cangying’s face darkened, Origin Qi surging. For a First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator like Chi Yue to speak to him this way was intolerable, and he instinctively wanted to teach her a lesson.

But before he could act, he suddenly felt a pair of mocking eyes on him. Under that gaze, Shi Cangying shivered, feeling that if he made a move, he would meet a terrible end.

He turned to look and saw Yang Kai smiling at him.

Shi Cangying frowned but didn’t dare act rashly. He said arrogantly, “I am a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm expert. I don’t need to look at Luo Jin’s face. If you had such cultivation, you could do the same.”

By now, Yang Kai understood why Shi Cangying had been hostile and dismissive from the start.

He was clearly afraid of being dragged into trouble.

After all, just two days ago, Yang Kai and the others had caused a huge scene at the City Lord’s mansion in Tianhe City, offending many powers and killing many people. Some of those powers were ones Chiyue Sect greatly feared, especially Heavenly Extreme Hall and Tianzhao Palace, both of which had powerful experts.

With Shi Cangying’s personality, what he truly feared was not Yang Kai and the others bringing disaster to Chiyue Sect, but being caught up in it himself. That’s why he was so unfriendly, wanting to drive them away and keep them from having any connection to Chiyue Sect.

That was why he didn’t care about Ye Hen’s presence or give Yang Kai and the others any face.

“Sir speaks very truly!” Yang Kai suddenly said with a smile.

"You brat!" Chi Yue’s pretty face darkened as she glared at Yang Kai. She hadn’t expected him to agree with that hateful old man, which she found hard to accept.

Yang Kai winked at her and smiled. “Strength is king, the strong are respected. Whoever has the biggest fist gets to speak. That’s an unchanging truth, no matter the time or place. Isn’t that so?”

Shi Cangying sneered, “So, you’re young but see things so clearly. Good, very good.”
