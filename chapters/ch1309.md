## Chapter 1309 — Shen Fanlei's Invitation

First night passed without incident. On the second day, Yang Kai and Yang Yan took advantage of the opportunity to stroll through Black Crow City; since they had come all this way, they might as well see if the place produced anything special—if luck favored them, they might even find some useful materials.

The two of them spent a full day browsing and indeed came away with much; materials that were hard to buy or find back in Tianyun City were surprisingly easy to locate here.

Naturally the prices here did not match the discounts offered by Yingyue Hall, but after the Zangxiong Valley expedition had netted Yang Kai and Yang Yan a large haul of Saint Crystal, such costs mattered little to them.

Yang Yan alone purchased forty to fifty million Saint Crystal worth of forging materials here, and still seemed not quite satisfied.

Yang Kai said little, though he watched with some alarm; at Yang Yan's rate of spending, the Saint Crystal they'd collected this trip would likely not last long. Yet from the nature of the materials she bought, Yang Kai had a vague sense that she truly meant to forge something extraordinary.

Alongside the slight alarm, he couldn't help but feel a measure of anticipation.

Had he not worried that further purchases would draw attention, Yang Yan would surely have dragged Yang Kai on; even so, he could sense many people, whether deliberately or not, paying attention to the two of them, as if greatly interested in them.

This was not surprising—a young man and woman spending tens of millions of Saint Crystal in a single day will catch the eye of those with intent. Fortunately, those observers seemed to hold back and did not act out of line; they simply lurked at a distance, watching in secret.

By the time evening came, Yang Kai and Yang Yan finally returned to the Flying Spirit Hall. As soon as they stepped into the Flying Flowers, Snow, and Moon Pavilion, Yang Yan headed straight for the third floor — clearly intending to make use of the refining room there for some purpose.

Yang Kai sat alone on the second floor, entering meditation to cultivate.

About two hours later Yang Kai suddenly opened his eyes, frowned slightly and looked outside. He waved his hand, and the door opened soundlessly; a young maid in green stood there—one of the two maidservants assigned to their building.

She first offered Yang Kai a graceful bow, then spoke softly, "Young master, a guest has come to visit. May I ask if you will receive him?"

"Who?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"He says he's your companion. Surnamed Shen!"

"Shen?" Yang Kai was astonished. After a moment's thought he asked, "Is he alone?"

"Yes." The maid nodded lightly.

A faint smile appeared on Yang Kai's lips. Before the maid could press further he waved his hand grandly, "Understood. Tell him to wait a moment. I'll be down shortly."

The maid bowed again, then turned and sashayed downstairs.

Yang Kai did not rise at once but sat where he was, eyes flashing as he pondered for a moment, then straightened and went out.

In the guest hall on the first floor, Shen Fanlei sat boldly upright, his posture wide and imposing. Two thick, arching brows framed his bright, spirited eyes. Though his looks couldn’t be called particularly handsome, he naturally carried a strong masculine vigor that gave him an air of boldness and heroism — especially those ever-vivid eyes of his, brimming with life and energy, easily drew one’s attention.

The two servant girls assigned to the Flying Flowers, Snow, and Moon Pavilion were clearly taken by him — they kept sneaking glances his way, and a faint blush colored their tender cheeks.

Shen Fanlei was clearly aware of it but feigned ignorance, sitting upright in a serious manner; yet from his occasional restless shifting he seemed ill at ease.

After a while, Yang Kai finally came down from upstairs. Shen Fanlei looked as if he’d been granted pardon — he quickly stood up and clasped his fists, saying, “Brother Yang, I came uninvited and have disturbed your cultivation. I hope you won’t take offense.”

Yang Kai, somewhat surprised, glanced at him and smiled gently, "Brother Shen, you are too formal. I was merely idling about—hardly disturbed."

Saying so, he motioned for the two maidservants to bring some tea.

The green-clad maid who had gone upstairs replied and went to prepare it.

Before long they served tea and a plate of spirit fruit.

Yang Kai did not know why Shen Fanlei had suddenly come, so he did not press; Shen Fanlei likewise did not state his purpose directly and instead chatted aimlessly with Yang Kai, unsure of what to say.

Yet Yang Kai could clearly feel that Shen Fanlei was unlike his usual self. The presence of the two maidservants seemed to put him under pressure—he was constantly watching his words and deeds, and his usual vigor and swagger had vanished, leaving him awkward and sometimes incoherent.

Each time this occurred the two maidservants stifled giggles at the side while Shen Fanlei grew increasingly embarrassed.

Seeing this, Yang Kai seemed to ponder, then suddenly waved his hand and said to the two maidservants, "You needn't stay—go down and rest. I'll call for you if needed."

The two maidservants exchanged a glance; though disappointed they obediently answered and left reluctantly, stealing a final longing look at Shen Fanlei as they went, clearly taken with him.

Yang Kai could not help but smile silently.

Once the two maidservants had departed and Shen Fanlei and Yang Kai were alone, Shen Fanlei visibly relaxed. His usual demeanor returned as if a weight had been lifted; the earlier awkwardness disappeared. The two talked of everything under heaven—sometimes roaring with laughter, sometimes serious as they debated cultivation problems, neither willing to give ground.

They talked for two hours; by the time it neared deep night Shen Fanlei still showed no sign of wanting to leave and had not revealed the purpose of his visit, which made Yang Kai uneasy.

Could the man have forgotten why he came?

With that thought Yang Kai cleared his throat and asked, "Brother Shen, may I ask if there is something you wished to speak to me about?"

Shen Fanlei looked startled, then slapped his forehead and uttered an 'ah!'

He really had forgotten.

Yang Kai smiled wryly and sat quietly, waiting for him to speak.

"It's actually nothing big," Shen Fanlei said. "Just that Brother Yang came to Zangxiong Valley to aid us twice, and now that you're in Black Crow City I can claim to be half a local. I thought I should treat you."

"Treat?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

“Mm.” Shen Fanlei nodded heavily. “I’ve heard that there’s quite an interesting place here in Black Crow City. I’ve long been curious about it but never had the chance to take a look. Now that the opportunity’s here, I thought I might as well invite Brother Yang along to see it together. What do you say?”

"An interesting place?" Yang Kai's interest was piqued. "What sort of place?"

Shen Fanlei's face briefly showed embarrassment but quickly cleared as he gave a sly chuckle, "I'll keep a little mystery—Brother Yang will see soon enough."

Yang Kai looked at him with an amused half-smile and, after a pause, said, "Very well, since Brother Shen specially invited me, let's go have a look. Should we bring Miss Shen and the others?"

"Absolutely not!" Shen Fanlei's face changed dramatically and he waved his hands in alarm, "This kind of thing must not be known to her, or she'll skin me alive! If not to avoid her notice, I wouldn't be visiting at night."

"Oh?" Yang Kai's thoughts stirred and he began to guess the sort of place Shen wanted to visit. After thinking a moment he asked, "What about Brother Wang?"

"Senior Brother Wang went out during the day to visit an elder here; he does not know when he will return. We needn't wait for him."

Yang Kai nodded lightly. "Then let's go."

Seeing Yang Kai agree, Shen Fanlei's spirit brightened and he led the way at once.

The two left Feiling Hall and merged into the throng of Black Crow City's streets.

Night in Black Crow City seemed even livelier than day; far more martial artists frequented the streets. Shen Fanlei evidently had arranged matters beforehand and deftly led Yang Kai through the winding lanes.

Before long they arrived at an unremarkable courtyard. At its gate stood two Saint Realm warriors in black armor, spears in hand, their eyes coldly sweeping over the scene.

At first glance it appeared ordinary, but when Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to probe within he was surprised to find the interior sealed with many restrictions that prevented him from seeing what lay inside.

Yet from time to time martial artists swaggered into the courtyard—men of mixed ranks and realms—but the two guards at the gate paid them no heed and did not question any who entered.

This made Yang Kai very curious; he wondered what kind of place it could be to appear so bustling yet remain so secretive.

Shen Fanlei stopped and stared at the courtyard with bright eyes, clearly excited. Yang Kai could distinctly feel his body temperature rise and his pulse quicken.

Yang Kai shot him a dubious glance. Shen Fanlei chuckled, "Come on, we're here."

Saying that, he swaggered in like the others and the two guards indeed made no move to stop or question them, treating them as if invisible.

Inside the courtyard, after walking down a pitch-dark pebble path and rounding a corner, a scene of riotous revelry suddenly hit them: heavy wine scents and women's perfumes filled the air, clear, charming laughter rang out, and the low strains of unfamiliar, mellow music drifted from somewhere.

Within was truly another world hidden away.

Yang Kai stared in astonishment and found himself looking at what resembled an open-air plaza. Countless banquet tables were set, and at each table sat guests who had arrived earlier, drinking and making merry. In the arms of many guests were languidly alluring women, each with seductive eyes and distinct temperaments—yet without exception all were exquisitely beautiful, fair-skinned and shapely. Their dress varied: some wore clothing so revealing it clung like a thin veil, showing tantalizing glimpses of form; others wore modest attire, like respectable household ladies.
