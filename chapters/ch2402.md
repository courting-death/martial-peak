## Chapter 2402 — Let Me Tell You a Secret

Even though Yang Kai and the others had already fled far away, they could still clearly feel the aftershocks of that explosive power. Each of their faces was filled with shock, and Fan Xin and several other Ice Heart Pavilion disciples were especially worried for their Master’s safety.

They didn’t know that Bing Yun had already returned to her peak strength. All they knew was that their Master had always been extremely wary of Chi Ri. Now that the two were facing off directly, they had no idea who would come out on top.

“Someone’s chasing us!” Liu Qianyun suddenly pointed behind them and called out in a delicate voice.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, frowning as he asked, “Why didn’t she stop him?”

He had thought that with Bing Yun’s current state, she would definitely be able to kill Pang Guang right under Chi Ri’s nose. After all, Pang Guang was only at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm and was seriously injured—how could he possibly withstand a blow from Bing Yun?

But in reality, Pang Guang was perfectly fine and was instead chasing after them.

Yang Kai didn’t know what unexpected event had occurred on Bing Yun’s side that allowed Pang Guang to slip through the net, but it was clear that they wouldn’t be able to leave easily. If they wanted to escape, they would have to kill Pang Guang first.

“It’s that Emperor Realm expert!” Ling Yinqin, having seen Pang Guang’s face, couldn’t help but lose her composure. She didn’t know Pang Guang’s name, but since he had come with Chi Ri earlier, he was clearly no friend.

The gap between the Emperor Realm and the Dao Origin Realm was like heaven and earth. Any Emperor could easily wipe out everyone on this ship.

Seeing Pang Guang chasing after them, everyone nervously looked to Yang Kai, wanting to know what he planned to do.

At a glance, Ling Yinqin and the others were all stunned, because Yang Kai didn’t look the least bit nervous. He stood there calm and unruffled, even wearing a mocking expression, as if the one coming wasn’t an Emperor but some trash sent to die.

“You all go ahead, I’ll catch up in a moment.” Yang Kai instructed Ling Yinqin and the others, then turned and leapt out.

“Senior Brother!” Liu Qianyun’s face was full of worry. She seemed to want to stay and fight alongside Yang Kai, but her strength was too low. She was also afraid she’d become a burden, leaving her torn and conflicted.

"Senior Brother Yang, I’ll help you!" Ling Yinqin said, about to leap up. At her Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, she could at least exchange a few blows with a First Stage Emperor Realm if she risked her life, though the outcome was uncertain. But in this situation, she was the only one who could help Yang Kai; the others were hopeless.

“No need for any of you to come—I’ll handle him myself. A mere First Stage Emperor isn’t worth worrying about.” Yang Kai turned back and flashed everyone a dazzling smile.

Ling Yinqin and the others were left dumbfounded.

An Emperor Realm expert had become “mere” in Yang Kai’s mouth. No one knew where he got such confidence.

“Don’t worry, I’ll catch up soon.” Seeing that Ling Yinqin and the others weren’t leaving, Yang Kai grinned.

As soon as he finished speaking, he actively distanced himself from the multi-deck ship, flying toward Pang Guang.

Ling Yinqin stood on the deck, hesitating for a long while before gritting her teeth and saying, “Let’s go!”

“But Senior Brother…” Liu Qianyun was so anxious she broke out in a sweat.

Ling Yinqin said solemnly, “If we stay here, we’ll only distract him. Your Senior Brother is far stronger than ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivators. Since he’s so confident, he’ll definitely be fine.”

Hearing this, Liu Qianyun suddenly remembered: back outside Gao City, when they were being chased by a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, Yang Kai had taken her and fled, and they’d still managed to escape alive.

Even a Third Stage Emperor couldn’t do anything to him. How could Pang Guang, a mere First Stage Emperor, possibly succeed?

Thinking of this, Liu Qianyun finally relaxed. She glanced back at Yang Kai’s position, silently praying for his safety, then joined Ling Yinqin and the others in steering the multi-deck ship away.

Out on the sea, Pang Guang suddenly stopped, hovering about a dozen zhang from Yang Kai. He glared at him furiously, but seeing Yang Kai’s radiant spirit and elegant bearing, with eyes bright as stars, he felt even more irritated. His anger surged, and he couldn’t help but roar, “You little brat, you’ve got some nerve to stop here and wait for me!”

Yang Kai grinned. “Since City Lord Pang is so eager to die, I’ll be happy to oblige.”

Pang Guang couldn’t help but burst out laughing. “Brat, have you eaten too much lard and muddled your mind? This Lord is an Emperor. Killing you is as easy as blowing dust away.”

“So what if you’re an Emperor?” Yang Kai curled his lip. “It’s not like I haven’t killed one before. Heads roll all the same!”

Pang Guang was stunned, sizing Yang Kai up as if seeing him anew. After a while, he nodded. “I have to admit, you’re very bold—your mouth matches your courage.”

“Enough nonsense!” Yang Kai said impatiently. “I’m in a hurry!” As he spoke, his wrist flicked and the Myriad Sword appeared, its broad blade pointing at Pang Guang. He said in a deep voice, “Are you coming here to die, or should I go over there and cut you down? You choose!”

“Waaah!” Pang Guang howled in fury, utterly beside himself. He had never encountered such an arrogant Dao Origin Realm cultivator before. Normally, anyone at that level would treat him with the utmost respect, barely daring to breathe in his presence—he was always the one looking down on them, never the other way around. Yet today, he was actually being scorned by someone at the Dao Origin Realm! Smoke practically poured from his ears as he roared, “If I don’t skin you alive today, I swear I’m no man!”

As soon as he finished, he let out a roar and shot toward Yang Kai like a cannonball, his momentum overwhelming, the impact blasting the surrounding space apart.

In midair, he suddenly punched at Yang Kai. In an instant, countless fist shadows filled the sky, enveloping Yang Kai’s position so densely that not even air could pass through.

Zing…

The sword rang out, its clear tone rising. Sword light flashed, sweeping across. The mighty power was like a slumbering dragon awakening, and the sudden eruption made Pang Guang’s whole body tremble.

Boom boom boom…

Deafening explosions rang out as the countless fist shadows shattered, leaving only a single sword light slashing straight at Pang Guang.

“Tss~” Pang Guang sucked in a cold breath, his face changing instantly. Without thinking, he dodged aside, the sword light grazing past him, but the sword intent it carried made his skin sting all over.

How could this brat possess such overwhelming strength?

Pang Guang could hardly believe his eyes. He, an Emperor Realm, had struck first, but not only did he gain no advantage, he was almost injured. Was this really a Dao Origin Realm cultivator?

Pang Guang wished he could dig out his own eyes and stick them on Yang Kai to see if he was actually an Emperor hiding his cultivation to toy with him.

Before he could finish the thought, Yang Kai suddenly appeared before him like a ghost, a ferocious grin on his face. He punched at Pang Guang, his fist wrapped in strange Law Power, making Pang Guang feel immense pressure. He didn’t dare be careless and punched back with all his strength.

Boom…

When their fists collided, Pang Guang’s whole body shook. He felt a tremendous force crash into him, his Qi and blood surging, and he couldn’t keep his footing, flying backward for several hundred zhang.

On the other side, Yang Kai was also sent tumbling through the air like a ragdoll.

After all, his Realm was still a bit lower than Pang Guang’s. To fight to a draw head-on was already remarkable.

Hiss hiss…

Both of them forced themselves to stop retreating at the same time. After steadying themselves, their expressions were completely different. Unlike Yang Kai’s calm and high-spirited battle intent, Pang Guang’s aura had plummeted. He realized this fight was nothing like the one-sided crushing he’d imagined—Yang Kai actually had the qualifications to contend with him.

The last time they fought in his cave mansion, things hadn’t been like this at all. Back then, Pang Guang had sensed that Yang Kai was different from ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivators, but he hadn’t seemed this formidable. Yet in just a few short days, Yang Kai’s strength had grown by leaps and bounds—so much so that Pang Guang could hardly believe it.

Was it the effect of the Butian Lotus? Pang Guang’s heart jolted as he suddenly realized something.

Immediately, anger surged up. That Butian Lotus should have been his! If he’d taken it, not only would his injuries have healed, he might have advanced further on the Martial Dao. But… it had been wasted, swallowed whole by this brat.

“Let me tell you a secret!” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly sounded in Pang Guang’s ear, startling him. Just a moment ago, Yang Kai had been several hundred zhang away, and he hadn’t noticed him move at all—yet now he was right beside him.

Just how fast was this brat?

The moment he heard Yang Kai’s voice, Pang Guang summoned his Imperial Treasure—a bronze gong. As Origin Qi poured in, the gong hummed, emitting a strange sound that seemed able to disturb the mind.

Suddenly, a jet-black light shot from the gong, aiming straight for Yang Kai’s waist. It was so fast, it was almost impossible to guard against.

But even such a sneak attack failed to catch Yang Kai off guard.

Pang Guang only felt a ripple of spatial power, and Yang Kai vanished. The next moment, his voice came from the other side: “Yao Changjun is dead!”

When he heard the name Yao Changjun, Pang Guang’s face changed dramatically. Instinctively, he thought Yao Changjun was nearby, his heart tightening—then he heard the rest of the sentence.

He blurted out, “How did he die?”

“Of course… I killed him!” Yang Kai finished, then burst into maniacal laughter.

“Bullshit!” Pang Guang cursed in fury, thinking Yang Kai was just toying with him. He’d sooner believe the world was upside down than believe Yang Kai had killed Yao Changjun.

That was a Third Stage Emperor Realm! Even he had to avoid him. How could Yang Kai, a mere Third Stage Dao Origin Realm, possibly kill him?

“Don’t believe me? Then look at this!” As Yang Kai spoke, he retreated a dozen zhang, and with a flick of his wrist, a five-colored long spear appeared in his hand.

Pang Guang’s eyes instantly widened as he stared at the five-colored spear in shock, then began to tremble all over.

He’d never seen this five-colored spear before, but he could feel the aura emanating from it!

This was clearly an extremely high-grade Imperial Treasure—even his bronze gong couldn’t compare. Anyone who possessed such a treasure had to be a Second or Third Stage Emperor expert. Most crucially, Pang Guang could sense Yao Changjun’s aura on this five-colored spear!
