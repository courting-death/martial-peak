## Chapter 2035 — Unplanned Convergence

The auction for the Dao Origin Fruit was extraordinarily fierce; at first there were even Void King Realm warriors bidding, but by the later stages Void King Realm cultivators could not get a word in — those qualified to call out bids were all Dao Origin Realm experts.

While they shouted prices, each of them also engaged in open and covert struggles; thread upon thread of Divine Sense intertwined above the auction hall, and now and then faint muffled groans came from certain private rooms, clearly showing that someone had taken a hit in those Divine Sense clashes.

The Drunken Old Man presiding over the auction seemed to have long expected this and paid it no mind; nor did anyone from the city lord's manor step forward, leaving those experts to wage a fierce struggle among themselves.

As one lofty price after another was called, the auction's atmosphere surged to an extreme, leaving the warriors seated in the hall staring in dumbfounded astonishment.

Yang Kai had truly broadened his horizons and only then realized how deep the foundations were of those experts backed by family Sects.

This round of bidding lasted for more than an hour, and in the end, that Dao Origin Fruit was won at the staggering price of eleven million by the Dao Origin Realm expert in Room A-1.

Eleven million — across the Star Realm even many second- or third-rate Sects could not easily produce such a sum, but if it could result in producing several Dao Origin Realm cultivators and thereby raise a Sect's overall strength, it was a worthwhile purchase.

With that, the auction was completely over.

Yang Kai and Brother Kang Siran left together, and the numerous warriors exited the auction hall in high spirits, clustering in threes and fives as they discussed what they had seen and heard at the auction.

"Brother Yang, let me return and prepare for a few days, then we set out for that place — I hope it... won't disappoint me."

When they reached a secluded spot, Kang Siran lowered his voice and spoke to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai naturally knew exactly what place he meant, and he nodded: "All right. I will await Brother Kang's news."

"I take my leave." Kang Siran cupped his fist and turned to go.

After he left, Yang Kai also turned and walked off in another direction.

A short while later he entered a street, casually found a tavern, ordered some food and wine, sat by the window, and began to eat and drink.

The reason he did not immediately return to his cave dwelling was of course because he needed to track Liu Yan; within Fenglin City he could not act, so he had to wait until the Fei Sheng Palace contingent left Fenglin City.

Fei Sheng Palace was no small force in the Southern Territory, and the reason they had come to a small place like Fenglin City was plainly because of Luan Feng's previous appearance; after the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda opened and news of the auction spread, the Fei Sheng Palace party's itinerary was delayed and they had not departed Fenglin City.

Yang Kai estimated they would not stay much longer, so he quietly waited for a suitable opportunity.

He had not expected that his waiting would last two days.

During that time the Fei Sheng Palace group lodged in an inn and did not leave, and he could vaguely sense Liu Yan's aura, so he was not worried about losing them nor about being discovered by the Second Stage Dao Origin expert Liu Yizhi.

Yang Kai secretly guessed that the reason the Fei Sheng Palace people lingered in Fenglin City was perhaps because Ning Yuancheng wished to subdue Liu Yan.

His guess was entirely correct.

At that moment, in an upper chamber of the inn Ning Yuancheng glared angrily at the round bowl in his hand; with a hand formation the bowl immediately produced the image of a strange fiery bird.

And Liu Yizhi had been guarding Ning Yuancheng's side the whole time, seemingly never leaving.

"You bitch!" Ning Yuancheng seemed beside himself and yelled, roaring at Liu Yan, "Hurry up and show your human form. Don't think that by playing dumb you can fool this Young Master — I know you're not dim, you can surely understand me."

Liu Yan, bound by many seals, merely beat her wings and floated silently in midair, neither crying nor making a fuss.

Then, when Ning Yuancheng's attention lapsed, she suddenly opened her beak and a ball of thunderfire — fiery red streaked with purple arcs — shot forth and slammed toward Ning Yuancheng.

This seemed to have happened many times before, so Ning Yuancheng was unfazed and did not even attempt to dodge; instead Liu Yizhi, standing nearby, waved his hand and, with the Power of the Laws surging, that thunderfire vanished without a trace.

"Heh heh, quite the temper. Fine — this Young Master likes you like that. Since you refuse to take human form, don't blame me for being ruthless. Deacon Liu, prepare — we are returning to the Sacred Palace!"

Liu Yizhi at his side rejoiced upon hearing this: "Young Palace Lord, are we returning?"

"Correct. I've tried for two days and still cannot make this bitch settle down; staying longer is pointless. We'll return to the Sacred Palace and then have Father take action — I doubt she will not submit then." Ning Yuancheng snorted coldly, altered his hand formation, and the bowl released sealing power that drew Liu Yan back inside.

Half an hour later the Fei Sheng Palace contingent left their rooms, casually disguised themselves, and leisurely headed for the city gate.

In another chamber of the same inn, Yang Kai, who had been meditating, suddenly opened his eyes, let out a soft breath, and said, "Finally leaving?"

If the people from Fei Sheng Palace still refused to leave, it would truly become a headache. After all, he had already agreed to join Kang Siran in exploring that cave mansion in a few days, and things would become troublesome if the timings clashed.

Although it was not a major matter and could be explained to Kang Siran with a word, it would mean breaking his promise.

At that moment the Fei Sheng Palace party were heading to the city gate, clearly departing Fenglin City, which was exactly what Yang Kai had hoped for.

He did not immediately follow, but waited a while before leaving his room and moving toward the same city gate.

Half a day later, on a plain a million li from Fenglin City, Yang Kai hurriedly pursued ahead.

Because of his connection with Liu Yan he could clearly sense the Fei Sheng Palace group's location and was not worried about losing them.

But he did not possess a suitable flying Secret Treasure, so for a time he could not catch up, which made him somewhat anxious.

Straining forward, Yang Kai abruptly felt a powerful Divine Sense sweep across from ahead; the suddenness changed his face and his feet involuntarily came to a halt.

That Divine Sense bore no killing intent but was frigid to the extreme; after sweeping past Yang Kai it withdrew leisurely.

Yang Kai stood in place, his expression unsettled, and after a moment he whispered, "There is someone else tracking the Fei Sheng Palace people? The feeling... it's that man surnamed Han."

Earlier at the auction that man surnamed Han had used Divine Sense to suppress Kang Siran and Yang Kai, leaving a lasting impression, so upon contact Yang Kai immediately recognized him.

He had not expected that besides his own interest in the Fei Sheng Palace people there would be other parties involved.

If the other had not been so arrogant in his strength as to dismiss a mere Void King Realm like him, Yang Kai might not have detected him.

If he were to attack the Fei Sheng Palace people then, he might inadvertently let the man surnamed Han seize the opportunity.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat.

It was fortunate the man surnamed Han had shown off so much; otherwise matters would truly have been troublesome.

That man was probably trying to use Divine Sense to intimidate Yang Kai into backing off and not meddling; any Void King Realm cultivator might have turned and fled, but Yang Kai had reasons he could not abandon the pursuit.

After a pause, Yang Kai resumed the chase, though his mood had shifted from anxious to calm and measured.

After all, that man surnamed Han clearly intended to harass the Fei Sheng Palace people; Yang Kai need not rush to act — it would be better to wait until both sides had wounded each other before stepping in.

And the man surnamed Han was likely pursuing them for Liu Yan; at the auction his financial resources had not matched Ning Yuancheng's, so he could only snatch her en route!

This notion coincided with Yang Kai's own thinking.

With the Han expert acting as vanguard, Yang Kai's spirits suddenly lifted; while pursuing he contemplated how to strike unseen, ideally so neither side would detect him.

But after much thought he could not devise a sound plan, leaving him frustrated, so he resolved to act according to the opportunity when it presented itself.

On the Fei Sheng Palace's tower-ship the disciples performed their duties to keep the vessel flying swiftly, and they were naturally unaware of the two hidden pursuers behind them.

Another half day passed, and as night fell Yang Kai, still in flight, suddenly stirred and looked toward the distance.

In the distance lights flashed and faint explosions could be heard; strong Spiritual Qi fluctuations transmitted over.

"That fellow has made a move!" Yang Kai rejoiced inwardly and immediately deployed his Nothingness Secret Art, silently and swiftly approaching.

His Nothingness Secret Art, besides being unusually effective at avoiding fatal blows, could conceal his qi and blood and aura; this space-derived technique was stronger than the concealment formations of ordinary great Sects.

Unless a cultivator a full Realm above Yang Kai probed with intent, others generally could not detect his presence.

After flying forward for another half hour, Yang Kai finally reached the place.

Under the moonlight a finely crafted tower-ship hovered in midair, and shadowy figures on its deck were peering in a certain direction.

One of the figures was clearly Ning Yuancheng, the Young Palace Lord of Fei Sheng Palace, and the others were naturally Fei Sheng Palace disciples.

About a thousand zhang from the ship two figures were entwined in midair, fighting fiercely.

Yang Kai peered closer and found the two were Liu Yizhi and the man surnamed Han.

They had likely been fighting for some time; with equal cultivation levels their contest relied on endurance and on-the-spot adaptability.

From the scene, both fought admirably—clearly veterans of many fierce battles. Judging by how things were unfolding, this contest was far from finished.
