## Chapter 1906 — Only One Set of Materials

No one knew exactly what conflicts or grudges Long Tianshang had with the sects that had been wiped out; only rumors circulated that it involved a woman.

Since then, Long Tianshang had gone into seclusion and vanished; in the past one thousand years no one had seen him — only that he was stationed on Shuiyue Star and secluding himself somewhere to cultivate.

Yet, unexpectedly, today he took the initiative to appear.

Faced with an expert of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, no one dared be neglectful; they all cupped their fists in salute, and even someone like Zuo De did not exempt himself.

Long Tianshang chuckled, returned Zuo De's salute, and said calmly, "After being apart for several decades, Master, your bearing remains unchanged — Tianshang is greatly comforted."

"Elder Long, you flatter me," Zuo De nodded.

"Uncle Long, what brings you out for a stroll today?" Ai Ou asked in surprise. Others did not know Long Tianshang's temper, but Ai Ou understood it all too well; across the Star Domain he alone had the most contact with Long Tianshang.

On ordinary days, even if he wanted to see Long Tianshang it was not an easy thing; when he often went to pay his respects he would be turned away and have to slink back — so he never would have expected the other to appear of his own accord today, which left Ai Ou greatly astonished.

"Came to join the fun," Long Tianshang laughed. He possessed an extraordinary air yet gave people a feeling like a spring breeze; anyone who met him could not help but feel a trace of warmth. Turning his head, he looked at Yang Kai: "This one… Yang Kai, I will call you by name straightaway, that is all right, yes?"

"Of course that's fine," Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

"Mm, you are excellent. From now on, my Hengluo Commerce Guild will be your ally. Come whenever you please; no need for formalities," Long Tianshang smiled.

"Thank you for your kindness, Elder. I will certainly treat this place as half my home," Yang Kai promptly seized the opportunity.

Xue Yue, listening at his side, of course understood what Yang Kai meant; immediately a hint of shyness and happiness appeared in her beautiful eyes.

At the same time, upon hearing Long Tianshang speak thus, Zuo De's old face could not help but look somewhat unpleasant. Although Long Tianshang had said nothing more, from this single sentence he knew the other was somewhat displeased with his actions; otherwise, why be so intimate with Yang Kai?

But… so what? A Third Stage of the Void King Realm compared with himself — in theory they were of equal standing. Thus he did not care much.

"That is good," Long Tianshang nodded, seeming pleased with Yang Kai's performance. Then, with a slight laugh, he shifted his tone: "All the same, since you have wagered with Master Zuo today, if you lose do not refuse to accept the terms. I, having come to witness this spectacle, will not stand idly by; if you dare flee, I will truly cut you down."

He said this with a smile, without a trace of killing intent in his tone, yet to everyone else it caused cold sweat to break out.

An expert of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm stationed here — who would dare not honor such a bet? That would be suicide.

"Rest assured, Elder, I am a man of my word; I will absolutely not go back on it."

"Very well," Long Tianshang looked to Zuo De. "Master, with me here to oversee matters, are you at ease?"

"Elder Long's word is enough," Zuo De nodded.

"In that case, you may begin. It has been a long time since I've seen something so interesting; I would like to watch a good show," Long Tianshang said with a faint smile. As his words fell, his figure dispersed like smoke and he suddenly vanished from where he stood.

He simply disappeared.

But everyone knew he had not gone far; it was only that his presence here exerted too great a pressure, so he had chosen to retreat into hiding.

"Brother Yang, are you really going to do this?" Ai Ou looked at Yang Kai with a grave expression; in his heart he did not want Yang Kai to compete with Zuo De in alchemy.

To him the proposal was both admirable and helpless.

It was like a three-year-old child trying to compare strength with an adult — the former had no chance of winning.

That appellation—"Brother Yang"—grated in Yang Kai's ears no matter how it was said. He could not expose the truth outright, so he feigned indifference and nodded, "Elder Long has already appeared here; does this Junior still have a chance to back out?"

"Haha, of course not," Long Tianshang's laugh rang out from the void. The tone sounded somewhat gloating, which made Xue Yue grind her teeth in anger.

"Ah!" Ai Ou heaved a heavy sigh. "Then the two of you begin; Ai Ou, Uncle Long, and the masters present will all be witnesses!"

He knew matters had reached a point of no return.

Still, he resolved in his heart that if Yang Kai were utterly routed, even at the cost of his reputation he would help Yang Kai escape this place.

After all, Yang Kai had dived into these muddy waters of his own accord over the matter of Gu Bihu.

He still could not fathom why Yang Kai would do such a thing.

"Haha, now you're done for," Zhan Yuan said, standing beside Zuo De and laughing with a look of petty triumph. "Master, do not hold back later; let him know that you are the most outstanding alchemist in the world."

"Hmph, no need for you to say so," Zuo De snorted coldly, eyes half-closed as he stared at Yang Kai. "What is it you intend to compete on? Do not say I take advantage of the small — the content of the contest is yours to decide; whatever spiritual pill it is, I will accept it."

He put on an air of certain victory and looked at Yang Kai with disdain.

How laughable — for there to still be such foolish people in the world who dare to compete with him in alchemy; soon he would show him what the character for 'submit' looked like.

"The contest item I already said: the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill!" Yang Kai smiled slightly.

"Impossible!" Before Zuo De could speak, Ai Ou suddenly shouted, his expression grave as he looked at Yang Kai: "Brother Yang, choose a different spiritual pill; the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill is really…"

It was simply too high in rank — a Void King-Grade Middle-Level spiritual pill. To refine it required a Void King-Grade alchemist; even an Origin-Grade Upper-Level alchemist lacked the qualification. It would be a waste of materials.

Yang Kai's Martial Dao cultivation was supremely lofty and he was not old; over the years he had certainly been devoted to martial cultivation, so how great could his alchemical attainments be? Even with outstanding talent, he could not possibly be at the level of a Void King-Grade alchemist!

Choosing the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill as the contest item was losing before the contest even began.

Ai Ou appreciated Yang Kai's intent to help Gu Bihu, but he could not let him jump into the fire and be left to his fate; if that were the case, what kind of person would he be? So he flatly rejected it and earnestly looked at Yang Kai: "Choose the Minor Recovery Pill instead. Everyone in the past has often taken that, and one can judge its quality."

The Minor Recovery Pill was a spiritual pill used by lower-level martial practitioners to restore Saint Yuan; it was only of Saint-Grade Lower-Level rank.

Ai Ou thought Yang Kai should be able to refine that; if he could produce one, he would have a chance to contend with Zuo De. If luck favored him and he produced a pill bearing Pill Patterns, there might yet be hope of victory.

Zong Ao nodded in agreement, thinking the Minor Recovery Pill a more appropriate choice. He knew Yang Kai had some alchemical skill — he had even once refined a spiritual pill that developed a Pill Cloud — so producing a Minor Recovery Pill bearing Pill Patterns should not be difficult.

Since Zuo De had allowed Yang Kai to choose the contest item himself, Yang Kai should not waste that advantage.

Zhan Yuan chimed in: "He himself said he would choose the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill — he must have confidence in his ability. I, Zhan, though unworthy, would like to observe your alchemical technique; the birth of a Void King-Grade spiritual pill is indeed a rare sight, is it not, everyone?"

At these words the alchemists present all showed excited expressions.

They also wanted to observe the process of refining a Void King-Grade spiritual pill.

Compared with the Minor Recovery Pill, they favored the latter option; after hearing Zhan Yuan's words, they all expressed agreement.

Ai Ou's face turned cold as he glared at Zhan Yuan, who instinctively drew back his neck and smiled awkwardly: "President Ai, please forgive me — as an alchemist I think from my own perspective and indeed showed some oversight. But most present likely feel the same; why not ask them?"

"No need — I choose the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill!" Yang Kai waved his hand.

"Have you thought this through?" Zuo De asked coldly.

"Master is not confident?" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"I am afraid you will have no reason left to laugh later!" Zuo De snorted. "Don't think I do not know what schemes you are hatching. Fine — I will refine a Taichu Soul-Returning Pill myself and grant your wish."

He still believed that Yang Kai was trading his personal freedom for the chance to save Gu Bihu; he thought everything Yang Kai had done was for that single Taichu Soul-Returning Pill.

He simply did not believe Yang Kai could refine a Void King-Grade spiritual pill.

"Chairman Ai Ou, bring out the materials," Zuo De said to Ai Ou.

Ai Ou frowned. "There is only one set of materials! The other items are fine, but the Seven-Colored Stag's Inner Core — there is only one. If the two of you are to compete to refine the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, that will not do."

"I do not care," Zuo De shook his head. "The materials you prepared were intended for me; as for where he obtains his materials, that is his own business. If he cannot assemble the materials, then he shall be deemed the loser!"

"Master, if that is the case, is this not somewhat an undeserved victory?" Ai Ou's face sank like water.

"He is destined to learn this lesson!" Zuo De remained unmoved and sneered. "Young people are always arrogant and do not know how high the heavens are or how deep the earth is. A few blows will make them mature and steady. Let today's matter be his lesson, Elder Long — what say you?"

Zuo De looked into the void and asked.

After a long pause, Long Tianshang's voice came: "Master's words are correct. Ai Ou, hand the prepared materials over to the master."

"Uncle!" Ai Ou was startled. If that were true, Yang Kai would have no hope at all — lacking the materials for the Taichu Soul-Returning Pill, what competition would there be? Ai Ou knew just how hard it was to find the Seven-Colored Stag's Inner Core; he had emptied the Hengluo Commerce Guild's resources to find one whose energy had already mostly dissipated — there was absolutely no second one in the world.
