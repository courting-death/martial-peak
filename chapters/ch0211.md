## Chapter 211 — The Might of the Secret Treasure

This clash ended in a surprisingly even outcome! However, upon closer inspection, it was evident that Yang Kai's injuries were significantly more severe than Bai Yunfeng's.

Even so, it left everyone in shock.

A peak Separation and Union Realm cultivator could engage in a fierce battle with a First-Stage True Essence Realm cultivator, and in a direct confrontation of martial skills, he did not fall short. Did this not imply that the martial skill he wielded surpassed the Bai family's secret technique, the Heavenly Net, by a notch?

Indeed, it was a Mystery-Grade martial skill!

Both young men were drenched in blood, gazing at each other from a distance. Bai Yunfeng's eyes were filled with madness and disbelief, completely unprepared for Yang Kai to still be standing. Not only did he show no signs of defeat, but he also grew more courageous as the battle progressed.

"I told you, today you will undoubtedly die. Even if the King of Heaven himself came, he could not save you!" Bai Yunfeng howled with a twisted expression.

Although he and Yang Kai had no grievances in the past, today's battle had repeatedly exceeded his expectations. As a young master of the Bai family, Bai Yunfeng was unwilling to accept this reality. With so many people watching, if he failed to subdue Yang Kai, would it not be akin to slapping his own face?

Amidst his roar, Bai Yunfeng reached out, and a scroll-like object appeared in his hand. As he unfurled it, countless images of rare and exotic beasts were revealed.

"The Bai family's Earth-Grade Middle-Level secret treasure, the Hundred Beasts Diagram!" Dong Qinghan's expression changed, and he exclaimed in surprise.

Though it seemed like an unintentional shout, it was actually meant to alert Yang Kai.

Bai Yunfeng sneered repeatedly, continuously infusing his True Essence into the secret treasure. As the True Essence poured in, the images of the beasts on the Hundred Beasts Diagram began to stir, and soon, beams of light shot out from the diagram, soaring into the air. They transformed into various forms of ferocious beasts, charging towards Yang Kai with a terrifying ferocity.

To ensure Yang Kai's demise, Bai Yunfeng spared no effort. This secret treasure was his greatest reliance and his final attack.

He could not believe that a disciple of the Lingxiao Pavilion, which had little fame, could survive amidst the stampede of beasts!

The beams of light in the air multiplied, and the bizarre beasts took form, resembling a stampede of thousands of horses, capable of crushing any enemy that stood in their way.

Yang Kai let out a furious roar, his eyes filled with murderous intent. Suddenly, a crimson long sword appeared in his hand.

The Shura Sword! The town-protecting treasure of the Shura Sect, a first-rate power overseas!

With the Shura Sword in hand, Yang Kai's already violent Primordial Qi surged to an alarming level. Everyone's eyes trembled, fixated on the crimson long sword.

They could all sense the palpable killing intent emanating from the sword, and gazing at it felt like witnessing a blood-soaked world where rivers flowed with blood and mountains piled with corpses, a chilling aura of bloodlust pervading the air.

The two Divine Roaming Realm experts from Ziwei Valley quickly shielded their young master, fearing that the terrifying killing intent would affect his mind.

Meng Wuya's expression changed slightly, as did the Sect Leader's. Neither had expected Yang Kai to possess such a weapon of slaughter, completely beyond their expectations.

As the beasts charged, Yang Kai raised the sword and swept it horizontally.

With a force capable of shattering the heavens, the sword light passed, and the beasts let out mournful cries, completely dissipating in mid-air.

Yang Kai stepped forward, his eyes filled with a bloodthirsty madness, yet he remained calm and composed. Bai Yunfeng's expression finally changed.

He never imagined that even after using his most powerful secret treasure, he would be unable to do anything to his opponent. The beasts that surged out from the Hundred Beasts Diagram could not even hinder Yang Kai in the slightest.

One beast after another fell under his blade, and the distance between Yang Kai and Bai Yunfeng quickly closed.

Affected by the frenzied bloodlust and endless killing intent, Bai Yunfeng could barely move, mechanically urging his True Essence into the Hundred Beasts Diagram, attempting to block Yang Kai.

Such actions were utterly meaningless, only accelerating the depletion of his True Essence.

Moments later, Yang Kai stood before Bai Yunfeng, his icy gaze sweeping over him, before raising the Shura Sword and striking down with force.

Everyone's hearts skipped a beat, for they realized that Yang Kai was not aiming at Bai Yunfeng, but rather at the Hundred Beasts Diagram!

He actually intended to destroy this Earth-Grade Middle-Level secret treasure.

The blood-red sword light sliced through the air like a rainbow piercing the sun, striking the Hundred Beasts Diagram with a resounding impact.

The few remaining beasts in the air vanished in an instant, and the Hundred Beasts Diagram rippled with a misty glow, a gash appearing where the sword's edge had passed.

A chorus of gasps filled the air.

The Hundred Beasts Diagram was, after all, an Earth-Grade Middle-Level secret treasure. Although it was not primarily a defensive item, it should not be so easily destroyed. To create such a large gash with a single strike, how sharp must this sword be, and what level of treasure was it?

Swish…

With a flick of the Shura Sword, the gash widened significantly.

Another flash of sword light swept through, accompanied by a tearing sound, as the Earth-Grade Middle-Level Hundred Beasts Diagram split in two and fell to the ground.

Three strikes! He destroyed an Earth-Grade Middle-Level secret treasure! No one dared to believe such a result.

Yang Kai twisted the sword's edge and flicked out a flourish, aiming at Bai Yunfeng, who stood there like a lost soul.

"Show mercy!" The two Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Bai family could no longer watch. Previously, they had been restrained by Meng Wuya and dared not act rashly, but now that Yang Kai was about to take Bai Yunfeng's life, they had no more hesitation and shouted urgently.

As they shouted, they swiftly lunged towards Yang Kai.

Meng Wuya did not stop them.

The Divine Roaming Realm experts were indeed exceptional; they almost instantly reached Yang Kai. One swept towards the Shura Sword with a flick of his finger, while the other quickly pulled Bai Yunfeng back.

With a clang, the Shura Sword was deflected, and Bai Yunfeng's life was spared.

Yang Kai cast a cold glance at the two Divine Roaming Realm experts from the Bai family, not pursuing them. With these two protecting him, he could not kill Bai Yunfeng.

"Please show mercy, young master. My young master is outmatched and has already lost!" The expert who had blocked the Shura Sword frowned and spoke urgently. Though his tone was somewhat displeased, it was absolutely respectful.

Yang Kai stared at him for a moment, hesitating for a long while before sheathing the Shura Sword.

The battle came to an end. It was a clash between different levels of power, yet the one with lower strength emerged victorious, leaving everyone perplexed.

"Everyone who has come to the Lingxiao Pavilion as guests, I welcome you warmly. However, the Lingxiao Pavilion is not a place where one can run rampant!" The Sect Leader’s expression was calm, but his tone betrayed the anger beneath.

This warning sent a wave of alarm through the gathered experts.

The Bai family members, in particular, felt too ashamed to remain. One person supported Bai Yunfeng, while another picked up the fragments of the Hundred Beasts Diagram from the ground, clasping his fists and saying, "We have caused much disturbance these days. I hope the Lingxiao Pavilion will forgive us. The Bai family will certainly come to apologize on another day!"

With that, the two Divine Roaming Realm experts quickly departed with Bai Yunfeng.

The people from Ziwei Valley also dared not linger. Initially, they had looked down on this small sect, coming here with an air of superiority and seeking to recruit talent. However, after witnessing two terrifying experts appear and seeing a disciple from the Lingxiao Pavilion almost annihilate the Bai family's young master, they were left trembling in fear.

The Lingxiao Pavilion… should not be underestimated. With high-level experts stationed here, even a single disciple could be a madman, a terrifying presence hiding beneath a facade of weakness!

Fan Hong and the others repeatedly apologized before hastily leaving.

Dong Qinghan and the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians did the same. Before departing, Dong Qinghan cast a shocked glance at Yang Kai, his astonishment still evident.

A crowd of Lingxiao Pavilion disciples had gathered outside, as this battle was truly earth-shattering. Not only had it attracted the five elders, but also the disciples who heard the commotion rushed over to watch.

Su Xuanwu coldly glanced at the group of disciples and said loudly, "All disciples who have been in contact with the three major powers in recent days, leave on your own. The Lingxiao Pavilion is a small sect, not a place for you to reside. Do not let your future be ruined, hmph."

Upon hearing this, many faces darkened, filled with regret.

They were all disciples who had already been recruited by the three major powers. They had thought that by siding with these powers, they would find a good place, but they never expected their own sect to be so formidable.

Did you not see how obedient the Divine Roaming Realm experts were after the Sect Leader and Shopkeeper Meng appeared?

At this moment, the disciples were filled with remorse. But with the Second Elder's words out in the open, could they still shamelessly remain?

In the arena, Yang Kai retracted his aura, gazing at the Sect Leader of the Lingxiao Pavilion with a mix of confusion and relief.

Meng Wuya chuckled softly and vanished without a trace.

"Everyone disperse," the Sect Leader waved his hand, then looked at Yang Kai with a gentle expression, saying, "Come with me!"

The five elders were all astonished, not expecting this battle to catch the Sect Leader's eye. Being summoned now would surely bring Yang Kai benefits.

Yang Kai nodded, as he had many questions and doubts that needed answers.

Covered in blood, he followed the Sect Leader step by step. The many disciples of the Lingxiao Pavilion looked at Yang Kai with none of the previous disdain and discrimination; all that remained was shock and fear.

Passing through numerous buildings, they arrived at a secluded area.

This was the Sect Leader's place of seclusion, a place where even the five elders could not tread.

A simple courtyard with a few thatched cottages, modest and unadorned. The courtyard was filled with common flowers and plants, with no trace of luxury to be found, only simplicity and elegance.

Leading Yang Kai into one of the thatched cottages, the Sect Leader casually tossed him a set of clothes and a bottle of pills.

"First, heal your injuries, then change your clothes and come find me," the Sect Leader said before floating away.

Though Yang Kai had many questions, he did not rush to ask. He entered the thatched cottage and took out the pills to consume.

This battle had been incredibly arduous; True Essence Realm experts were indeed not easy to deal with. He had suffered many setbacks during the confrontation, and had it not been for the last resort of the Mark of the Stars, he might have been defeated. The Bai family's Heavenly Net technique was formidable, not much weaker than the Mark of the Stars.

This battle could be said to have been initiated by Yang Kai himself. While there was a hint of rivalry and jealousy, it was not the primary reason.

Yang Kai simply needed to validate many of his speculations at this critical moment.

Why did Fourth Master Yang come to the Lingxiao Pavilion himself? What connection did he have to this place? Was this where he had undergone trials in the past? There were many deep meanings that Yang Kai could not fathom. Since he could not understand, he decided to create a ruckus, to the point where he could not clean up his own mess. Surely someone would come to his aid.

And that person, the key figure, was unexpectedly the Sect Leader of the Lingxiao Pavilion.
