## Chapter 2285 — Qingyang Gold Token

Zhou Fu quickly went out to make arrangements for the Formless Profound Grass.

In fact, Yang Kai could have bought the Spiritual Herb himself, but it would have wasted some time and effort. With Zhou Fu’s help, it was different. The shopkeepers of these stores were all in regular contact; if any materials were needed, a single word would get everything arranged, far more efficient than if Yang Kai did it personally.

After Zhou Fu left, the two disheveled fellows asked eagerly, “Master Yang, you want Formless Profound Grass—are you going to refine pills?”

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, “Something like that. Judging by your appearance, you two must also be Alchemists?”

"Indeed, indeed! To be able to accompany Master Yang is truly an immense honor," one of them replied with a fawning smile.

The other said, “Master Yang, the two of us have admired you for a long time, but unfortunately never had the chance to meet. Who would have thought we’d have such an opportunity today? It’s truly a blessing across three lifetimes.”

These two seemed to have smeared oil on their tongues, taking turns to flatter, their expressions humble and respectful, as if they were about to worship Yang Kai.

Ye Qinghan was dumbfounded at the sight, her worldview shattered, almost unable to believe her eyes.

In the world she knew, every Alchemist was proud and aloof, never had she seen Alchemists fawn and flatter like this.

But on second thought, only a stronger Alchemist could subdue other Alchemists. Yang Kai had even refined the nearly lost Supreme Mystic Pill, so it was only natural for these two Void King-Grade Alchemists to be so respectful.

The two were still flattering endlessly, praising Yang Kai to the heavens, making him out to be peerless in the world.

Yang Kai coughed lightly and said, “Do you two have something you need me to answer? I happen to have some free time now…”

Hearing this, the two exchanged glances, both seeing excitement in each other’s eyes. One hurriedly said, “Master Yang, your insight is sharp. It’s like this: it’s said that when you refined Origin Condensing Pills at the Spiritual Pill Workshop, you were loved and praised by all the customers. But ever since the two of us took over, the Origin Condensing Pills we refine always seem to lack a certain depth, and many customers are dissatisfied. As a result, the Spiritual Pill Workshop’s customer flow has dropped a lot. We were hoping… hoping… if Master Yang has time, could you share some of your alchemy experience with us?”

Yang Kai replied, “The Origin Condensing Pill formula at the Spiritual Pill Workshop was improved by Master Huangpu, right?”

“Exactly! Master Huangpu is an Imperial-Grade Alchemist, the pillar of our Ziyuan Commerce Guild!”

“Since the formula came from Master Huangpu, there’s definitely no problem with it. I suppose there are some flaws in your refining process. Just talking about it may not help much. How about this… you two refine a batch of Origin Condensing Pills right now, and I’ll observe from the side. How about that?” Yang Kai asked.

The two were instantly invigorated, knowing Yang Kai was about to give them on-the-spot guidance. They immediately realized this was a heaven-sent opportunity, a favor others could only dream of. How could they refuse? They responded in unison, “We dare not disobey Master Yang’s command. Please, Master!”

Yang Kai nodded and stood up. With practiced ease, he led the two down to the underground alchemy room, with Ye Qinghan following closely, curiosity piqued.

Although she possessed Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation, she had never actually seen anyone refine pills in her life, so she was especially interested.

Before long, the group arrived at the underground alchemy room. The heat surged here, with an array drawing earth fire for alchemy. Yang Kai had spent several months here before, so he was naturally very familiar with it.

He had each of them take out a set of materials and begin refining, while he stood in front of them, observing carefully.

With his current alchemy skills, instructing two Upper-Level Void King-Grade Alchemists posed no problem. Refining techniques, inscribing spirit arrays, controlling the heat—each small detail could affect the quality of a batch of Spiritual Pills.

Yang Kai offered suggestions from time to time, and the two Alchemists accepted them with humility.

In a flash, half a day passed. The two each opened their furnaces, producing five or six pills apiece, all of excellent quality, leaving them overjoyed and deeply grateful to Yang Kai.

At this moment, Zhou Fu happened to send word that he had brought the Formless Profound Grass.

After instructing the two to reflect on the gains and lessons of this alchemy session, Yang Kai returned to the back hall’s secret room.

Zhou Fu was waiting in the secret room. Seeing Yang Kai arrive, he quickly took out a Spatial Ring and said, “I am glad I did not fail in my task. Here are two thousand stalks of Formless Profound Grass. Please accept them, Master Yang.”

Yang Kai raised his brows and nodded, “Shopkeeper Zhou, you’re very efficient.”

Two thousand stalks of Formless Profound Grass were enough to last him a long time, and Zhou Fu had managed to gather them in just half a day. Clearly, he had gone to great effort. If Yang Kai had gone to buy them himself, he definitely wouldn’t have been able to get so many in such a short time.

“What about the price…” Yang Kai picked up the Spatial Ring and looked up to ask.

Zhou Fu said, “These Formless Profound Grass aren’t worth much. Just take them as a token of my appreciation. Please don’t refuse, Master.”

Yang Kai smiled, “I can’t accept a reward for no merit. Shopkeeper Zhou, there’s no need for this.”

As he spoke, Yang Kai suddenly waved his hand, and a small mountain of Source Crystals instantly appeared on the table.

Before Zhou Fu could say anything else, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly flickered and disappeared from the secret room, taking Ye Qinghan with him.

Only a voice reached Zhou Fu’s ears: “If Shopkeeper Kang ever returns to Fenglin City, please pass on a message for me—when we meet again, we must drink heartily together.”

Zhou Fu was stunned, staring at the Source Crystals on the table, and let out a bitter laugh.

On a certain street in the city, Yang Kai and Ye Qinghan’s figures suddenly appeared.

As soon as Ye Qinghan appeared, her delicate body staggered, nearly falling to the ground. Her face was a bit pale as she looked at Yang Kai in shock and asked, “Young Master Yang, was that… spatial divine ability?”

“Are you alright?” Yang Kai asked instead of answering.

“It’s my first time experiencing such teleportation. I could clearly feel the chaotic currents of the surrounding void. It was a bit frightening!” Ye Qinghan replied.

Yang Kai smiled, “Then you’re fine.”

As he spoke, he took out a Transmission Compass and sent a message through it.

“What is Young Master Yang doing?” Ye Qinghan asked.

“Oh, I’m preparing to leave. Just leaving a message for the Qin Family Head.”

“Young Master Yang isn’t going to say goodbye in person?” Ye Qinghan looked at him curiously.

Yang Kai said, “There’s no need for a face-to-face farewell. It’s not like I won’t be back. Besides, the Qin Family Head should be very busy right now. Didn’t you say before that the heads of the major families in Fenglin City are all helping City Lord Duan manage Linghu Palace?”

Ye Qinghan said, “It’s fine for the Qin Family Head, but what about Miss Qin…”

“What about Qin Yu?” Yang Kai glanced at her and said, “When I left seclusion before, I quietly checked on Qin Yu’s aura and found she was doing well, her vitality steady and her qi and blood abundant.”

Ye Qinghan smiled, “During the month you were in seclusion, Miss Qin came to wait outside your door for an hour every day. She probably wants to say something to you. Won’t you give her a chance?”

Yang Kai glanced at her and curled his lip. “You women really are the most gossipy.”

As he spoke, he had already left a message for Qin Chaoyang through the Transmission Compass, telling him he was leaving Fenglin City for a while and would return if he had the chance.

The Myriad Sword of the Qin Family was in his hands, and he had already agreed with Qin Chaoyang that when Qin Yu advanced to the Emperor Realm, he would return the Myriad Sword to the Qin Family. With this connection, his ties to the Qin Family could not be severed. He just didn’t know when—or if—Qin Yu would ever break through, or if she would have the opportunity and fortune to do so.

Next, he took out the disciple identity token from Qingyang Shrine, preparing to inform Gao Xueting of his departure. This identity token could not only be used to verify identity, but also as a communication tool. As long as there were people from Qingyang Shrine nearby, they could contact each other through their tokens.

“What’s that…” Ye Qinghan’s beautiful eyes suddenly narrowed. Staring at the golden token, a thoughtful look flashed in her eyes. When she saw the words “Qingyang” on the front, her body trembled and she exclaimed, “Qingyang Gold Token!”

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise, not understanding why she reacted so strongly.

“So Young Master Yang is actually an elite inner disciple of Qingyang Shrine! I’ve truly been disrespectful…” Ye Qinghan smiled bitterly, her face showing a hint of envy.

“Elite inner disciple?” Yang Kai raised his brows. “How did you see that?”

Ye Qinghan looked at Yang Kai with a strange expression and said, “Since you’re a top talent of Qingyang Shrine, don’t you know the disciple ranking system?”

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched and he said awkwardly, “I’m just a nominal member of Qingyang Shrine. I’m not really a true disciple.”

“Then this Gold Token…” Cold sweat broke out on Ye Qinghan’s forehead, her head spinning and her whole body trembling. She secretly wondered if Yang Kai had snatched this Gold Token from someone else. If that were the case, bringing him to Thousand Leaves Sect would definitely bring disaster to the sect.

“Elder Gao forced it on me!” Yang Kai said resentfully.

“Forced… on you…” Ye Qinghan was nearly fainting. So many outstanding youths in the Southern Territory fought desperately for a mere Qingyang disciple token but could not obtain one, yet here Yang Kai made it sound like Elder Gao had forced it on him, as if he was reluctant to accept.

Ye Qinghan felt completely unwell, not sure if it was from the spatial teleportation earlier, as she felt dizzy and lightheaded.

“Huh, your face is so pale! Did you skip breakfast?” Yang Kai looked at her and asked.

“Young Master Yang…” Ye Qinghan looked at Yang Kai pleadingly, “Please don’t joke with me, I’m timid, don’t scare me.”

“What are you talking about?”

“Does Young Master Yang really not know about the Qingyang Gold Token?”

Yang Kai said seriously, “I only got this thing a month ago. I’ve been in seclusion the whole time. What’s so special about this token?”

Ye Qinghan took a deep breath, her ample chest heaving so violently it nearly burst her clothes, drawing Yang Kai’s frequent glances. After calming herself, she finally said, “Although all Qingyang Shrine disciple tokens look the same, they come in gold, silver, and bronze. In the shrine, only the very top inner disciples are qualified to possess the Qingyang Gold Token. When the Gold Token appears, no disciple dares disobey. This token represents a status equal to an ordinary elder, and at any Qingyang Shrine property in the Southern Territory, you can mobilize personnel and resources. It’s extremely valuable.”
