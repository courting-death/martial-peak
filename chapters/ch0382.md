## Chapter 382 — True Spirit Within the Jade

Inside the room, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the Yang Crystal Jade Bed, furiously channeling the True Yang Technique.

Unlike Lü Si beside him, who only drew in a gentle amount of Yang Qi to refine his meridians, Yang Kai was voraciously devouring the energy from the Yang Crystal Jade Bed.

His entire body seemed to transform into a bottomless pit, each acupuncture point exuding an unparalleled and overwhelming suction force. Streams of golden energy were visibly drawn from the Yang Crystal Jade Bed, flowing like threads into Yang Kai's acupuncture points, drilling into his meridians and converging in his Dantian.

An unprecedented feeling of comfort arose.

No wonder this was a Middle-Level Mystery-Grade gem; Yang Kai could distinctly sense just how pure and abundant the Yang Qi entering his body was.

It seemed that the influx of Yang Qi had stimulated his meridians, which continuously operated to refine the subtle impurities within, making the Yang Qi even more pure and unsullied.

Soon, his meridians became saturated and swollen. With a soft ticking sound, a drop of fresh Yang Liquid formed and settled in his Dantian.

The swollen meridians suddenly felt empty, and the speed of absorption quickened once again.

The energy from the jade bed gradually became Yang Kai's capital. Drops of Yang Liquid formed inside his Dantian, one after another, while the entire Yang Crystal Jade Bed diminished at an astonishingly subtle speed.

During this process, Yang Kai’s flesh, blood, and internal organs seemed to undergo an indescribable baptism.

Two days later, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, his gaze sparkling brightly.

The Yang Liquid stored in his Dantian had now exceeded at least two hundred drops. When he had emerged from the Bloodthirsty Evil Cave, he only had around twenty drops left; now, that number had skyrocketed tenfold.

This clearly demonstrated just how frighteningly terrifying the energy contained within this huge piece of Yang Crystal Jade Bed was.

The current Yang Liquid was vastly different from the Yang Liquid he had before. His True Yuan had become more refined. Even a single drop of Yang Liquid now harbored an energy level several times greater than before. Therefore, even with just over two hundred drops, it represented a wealth that could not be ignored.

It would easily support Yang Kai's extravagance for a long time.

The entire Yang Crystal Jade Bed had nearly vanished without a trace. Lü Si could hardly imagine that the Yang Crystal Jade Bed, which the Lü Family had expended tremendous financial resources and manpower to procure for healing purposes, had already been on the brink of disappearing from the world less than two days after he had possessed it.

Only a palm-sized piece remained!

Yang Kai held in his hand this small piece of Yang Crystal Jade, his gaze flickering with confusion.

He discovered that even while operating the True Yang Technique, he could not absorb the energy within this piece of Yang Crystal Jade, as if some mystical force was resisting the suction coming from his body.

If he truly made up his mind to absorb it, Yang Kai was confident he could consume it entirely, but having encountered such a strange phenomenon, he wanted to understand it.

The palm-sized jade piece was still entirely golden, and its color was more solid and weighty compared to the surrounding Yang Crystal Jade. Within it, there was a subtle radiance flowing ceaselessly.

Curiously observing for a moment, he found nothing particularly special.

After a moment of stupor, Yang Kai released his Divine Sense to explore. However, as his Divine Sense delved into the jade, it seemed to plunge into darkness, yielding no results; it was impossible to perceive any abnormalities from this piece of jade.

Both True Yuan and Divine Sense were utterly ineffective, and this piece of jade appeared to be merely ordinary Yang Crystal Jade. However, Yang Kai always felt something was off about it. Helpless, he called out to the door, "Tu Feng, Yuxian!"

The door opened, and Tu Feng along with Tang Yuxian entered together.

"Young Master, what are your instructions?" Tu Feng inquired in a deep voice. Tang Yuxian, however, fixed her gaze upon Yang Kai, realizing that in just two days, the Young Master seemed to carry an increased aura of strength. He had made significant strides since his recent ascension to the seventh stage of the True Yuan Realm, his demeanor radiating a sense of pride and confidence.

Strange! Tang Yuxian shook her head secretly; how could he become so powerful in just two days of closed-door cultivation?

Moreover, where did the Yang Crystal Jade Bed go? As she scanned the room, she could not find any trace of the jade bed that had been there before.

Yang Kai casually tossed the jade piece in his hand to Tu Feng, saying, "Take a look at this and see if there's any mystery within."

Tu Feng received the piece, a hint of surprise flitting across his expression before he quickly reined it in. Furrowing his brow, he exerted power to sense the jade piece for a while, then shook his head and said, "My understanding of Divine Sense is not as good as Yuxian's; I can't perceive anything special. Let her take a look."

Yang Kai glanced at Tang Yuxian in surprise, seeming to realize she was actually superior to Tu Feng in the insights regarding the soul.

Upon reaching the Divine Roaming Realm, not only must one cultivate the power of their body, but they must also cultivate the power of their soul. Some individuals have unique understandings of Divine Sense and soul techniques, naturally making them stronger in these aspects than others in the Divine Roaming Realm.

Tang Yuxian was undoubtedly one of those individuals.

Nodding his head, Yang Kai watched as Tu Feng tossed the jade piece to Tang Yuxian.

With a gentle smile, she received the jade piece and closed her beautiful eyes, pouring her Divine Sense into it.

Gradually, the expression on Tang Yuxian's pretty face turned slightly serious, as if she had truly made some unusual discovery. The Divine Sense she invested into the jade piece grew increasingly powerful.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened, his heart secretly hopeful.

After a considerable amount of time, Tang Yuxian finally withdrew her Divine Sense, softly letting out a breath, and opened her eyes. There sparkled with a hint of excitement, "Young Master, this is a piece of precious jade that has birthed True Spirit!"

"True Spirit?" Both Yang Kai and Tu Feng were taken aback.

"True Spirit!" Tang Yuxian nodded firmly, "Moreover, according to my perception, it has not been long since it was birthed, and it already possesses rudimentary consciousness, which is why it could deceive your attempts of Divine Sense inspection."

"A True Spirit with consciousness?" Tu Feng exclaimed, "That must have taken at least several thousand years to develop."

"Shh!" Yang Kai shot Tu Feng a glance.

Tu Feng was startled, and suddenly recalled something. He quietly released his Divine Sense to spread around, and moments later, his expression changed coldly, letting out a heavy huff, his face darkening.

He sensed that several experts in the Divine Roaming Realm were hiding around the room, concealing their aura, quietly monitoring the situation.

These individuals were clearly experts from the Lü Family!

It wasn’t that Tu Feng's Divine Sense was inferior; rather, these few experts were utilizing a special treasure. Moreover, they had calculated matters with care, so he had failed to notice them. If it hadn’t been for Yang Kai’s earlier glance, he would likely have overlooked doing a thorough investigation.

Secretly astonished, he could only ponder whether Yang Kai was just cautious or had sensed something from the beginning.

Realizing someone was watching from outside, Tu Feng no longer dared to speak loudly.

Yang Kai beckoned the two of them closer, and Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian hurriedly approached, sitting cross-legged opposite Yang Kai.

With their heads leaned close together, the three began to converse in low voices.

"I’ve heard discussions about True Spirits within jade before; it’s said that in ancient times, there was a chance for a true spirit to be born from certain precious jade. Is this what we’ve got here?" Yang Kai whispered with lowered voice.

Tang Yuxian nodded, lightly saying, "Indeed, but the chance of a True Spirit forming within jade is exceedingly low; you might not find even one in ten thousand pieces of precious jade."

As she spoke, her face grew somewhat excited, "But once a piece of jade gives birth to a True Spirit, its value instantly skyrockets several dozens of times."

Tu Feng nodded in agreement: "That’s right."

Yang Kai was suddenly intrigued. He asked, "What use does a True Spirit have?"

The two Blood Servants exchanged glances and felt a rush of pride. Following Yang Kai, they often found themselves amazed by his insights, yet now it became clear that he was still merely a young man, not fully aware of those hidden truths or rumors as they were.

So it turns out we are still useful. Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian thought to themselves.

Not mincing words, Tang Yuxian hurriedly explained, "The formation of True Spirits is incredibly difficult; they can only take shape in very large jade mines. If I’m not mistaken, the Yang Crystal Jade Bed from the Lü Family must have been extracted from a large Yang Crystal Jade mine. The outer layer of the mine may not be of high grade, but the jade bed itself is the product from the center of the mine."

"And this small piece should be the very core of that Yang Crystal Jade Bed, right?"

At this point, Tang Yuxian certainly could guess the origin of the jade piece.

"Yes."

Tang Yuxian smiled softly, "They believed that the Yang Crystal Jade Bed was the essence of that jade mine; in reality, this piece of jade is the true essence of essences! The energy and value contained within it likely surpass the entire jade mine."

Yang Kai felt invigorated.

"A True Spirit... is the best kind of weapon spirit born naturally!" Tang Yuxian's gaze became dreamy, her tone revealing unhidden admiration, "If it can be refined into a treasure, then once the treasure is completed, its quality will definitely see a great improvement. One could say that having this item in the hands of a master refiner could potentially result in the emergence of Spirit-Grade treasures!"

Spirit-Grade...

That was merely a legend.

Xiao Fusheng had spent a lifetime pursuing the creation of a single Spirit-Grade pill. Similarly, to this day, the highest-grade treasure ever known had merely been an Upper-Level Mystery-Grade, which was exceedingly rare, with no Spirit-Grade treasures ever surfacing in the world.

It seemed that some mysterious force was suppressing this world, establishing the Upper-Level Mystery-Grade as the limit.

"If it’s given more time to cultivate true wisdom, it can exert enormous effects, moving through heaven and earth unfettered; subduing it would also offer great support!" Tu Feng added.

“How long should we wait?" Yang Kai asked.

Tang Yuxian chuckled, "At least several hundred years or even more."

Yang Kai couldn’t help but roll his eyes.

After several hundred years, who knows if he would still be alive.

"The growth of a True Spirit is very slow; after all, it is not a physical body. But if it matures, there will likely be no opponent in this world."

"So powerful," Yang Kai gasped.

"Indeed, so powerful," Tang Yuxian nodded gravely, "Besides refining treasures, if one could safely absorb and refine a True Spirit, the benefits to a person would be immeasurable. It could bring some unexpected changes and might also give you profound abilities."

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s eyes gleamed with intent.

Tang Yuxian noticed the change in his expression and quickly waved her hand to caution, "Young Master, you absolutely must not think of making a move on it right now. The energy contained within this small piece of jade exceeds your imagination. If you truly absorb it into your body, you would be courting death."
