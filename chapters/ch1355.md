## Chapter 1355 — The Might of Self-Detonation

Inside the ancient ruin, before the round gate, Yang Kai kept unleashing Space Blades toward a single point on the puppet's chest, and under the influence of the Mirror Lake Mud Dragon Formation and the Ground-Imprisonment Formation, the puppet, aside from swinging its giant staff in aimless assaults, even seemed somewhat hindered in its footsteps.

So although Yang Kai often failed to strike the exact same spot, the constant attrition nonetheless caused a fissure about three cun deep to open at its chest. Even so, that puppet showed no sign of being affected.

It was Yang Kai and the other two who paid the price, their consumptions enormous.

Cai He and Du Sisi need no explanation—the effort to sustain the grand arrays had nearly drained their Saint Yuan dry.

The Space Blades Yang Kai wielded also took a heavy toll on him; once or twice was tolerable, but after hundreds, even thousands, his Sea of Consciousness was on the verge of desiccation. Were it not for the Warm Spirit Lotus nourishing his spirit, such overdraft would have inflicted indelible harm.

Popping another Pill for restoring Divine Sense into his mouth, Yang Kai's face was ashen while his eyes remained fixed on the crack in the puppet's chest, and he launched another Space Blade.

A faint cracking sound came from the side.

Cai He cried out in alarm: "Brother Yang, it's not holding!"

His voice trembled with a kind of panic that was hard to describe—indeed, their formations were already teetering and could collapse at any moment. Once the arrays broke, without their restraining power to slow the puppet, the three of them could easily fail in their mission.

There might still be a chance to rally, but with the puppet's perverse speed, whether he and Du Sisi could flee its clutches in time was far from certain.

Besides, after struggling so long, none of them wanted to see all their effort undone.

No sooner had he spoken than another faint crack sounded, and then the countless firefly-like lights that had filled the place vanished in an instant, as if they had never been there.

On the other side, Du Sisi's pretty face went pale as she stared at the Formation Foundation in her hands. The foundation given by their clan elders had shattered into pieces at that moment and could no longer be used.

Her Ground-Imprisonment Formation collapsed before Cai He's grand array did! Pain and horror warred in her heart.

Without the aid of the Ground-Imprisonment Formation, the whirlpools and mud dragons formed within the Mirror Lake were no longer able to restrain the puppet’s movements. Before long, the puppet unleashed its might, breaking free from the entanglement of several mud dragons and shattering the whirlpools across the lake’s surface. Its crimson eyes then locked onto Du Sisi, who stood there frozen in place. Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai swept a hand across his Spatial Ring, and a scroll-like Secret Treasure appeared out of thin air.

With the Saint Yuan being pumped in like a maniac, shadowy mountain peaks flew forth one by one.

The Hundred Mountains Painting! The only offensive Secret Treasure Yang Kai possessed. In combat he preferred to trust his own strength over relying on treasures, so he seldom owned attack Secret Treasures; this Hundred Mountains Painting was peculiar, which was why he had refined it into his body.

He had not used the Hundred Mountains Painting against the puppet before, but now he had no choice but to pull it out.

In an instant the sky filled with phantom peaks, large and small, and Yang Kai, barely caring for the treasure's stability, forced out thirty or forty peaks.

That was his absolute limit of control.

The moment those mountain phantoms appeared they thundered down at the puppet. The puppet's giant staff rose to block, and every approaching peak was forcefully repelled—none could draw near to its body.

A hard light flashed in Yang Kai's eyes; with a flick of Divine Sense the flying peaks turned back and this time they did not strike but instead swirled around the puppet, sealing off the space around it.

"Explode for me!" Yang Kai gritted his teeth and shouted.

As his voice fell, terrifying waves of energy burst from the clustered peaks. Dazzling radiance bloomed until the place shone like day, so bright Cai He and Du Sisi could scarcely look.

Boom, boom, boom...

Cataclysmic energy rolled like mountain-crumbling, earth-rending upheaval. Gale-force winds threw Cai He and Du Sisi far away; even the concealed array devices were swept up.

When the energy subsided, a tattered, ruined scroll of a Secret Treasure drifted down from the sky—the Hundred Mountains Painting Yang Kai had just used.

Yet at this moment the Painting had lost all its spirit; the painted peaks that had once covered it were gone. Before it even hit the ground it crumbled to dust and vanished into the world.

The Secret Treasure had self-detonated!

Not every treasure had such a power, but Yang Kai's Hundred Mountains Painting did. It had helped him many times since he acquired it and was not low-grade—it was an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure. But to restrain the puppet's movements he could not be stingy; he had to let the Hundred Mountains Painting detonate, otherwise Du Sisi it had locked onto would have no escape.

When Yang Kai looked again he was taken aback, then his expression brightened greatly.

The puppet had been struck to the ground by the detonation's force, and this time it appeared wounded, lying still for a long moment. From the fissure at its chest flickered a strange, faint red light.

The self-detonation of an Origin-Grade Secret Treasure was clearly no ordinary force.

Wasting no time, Yang Kai leapt forward and in the blink of an eye stood before the puppet. With a bound he landed atop its chest and unleashed wave after wave of Space Blades into that three-cun-deep fissure.

At such close range, and with the puppet unable or unwilling to resist, every blade found its mark. The fissure deepened and widened almost visibly.

A flicker of joy flashed in Yang Kai's eyes—he felt that if given a little more time he could pierce through the puppet's breast.

He did not let up his vigilance; while condensing Space Blades he also split his mind to probe the puppet's movements. After a mere twenty breaths the puppet's eyes suddenly flickered, its blood-red glare like a beast choosing its prey, chilling to the bone.

Danger prickled Yang Kai's skin. Hearing the gusting wind behind his head, he rolled, leapt to the side, and once more formed a Space Blade toward the fissure while throwing a punch.

His fist and the Space Blade struck the fissure almost simultaneously.

Crack...

It sounded as if something had been broken. Yang Kai's eyes brightened; with Divine Sense he issued an order to the Fire Bird artifact spirit.

The Fire Bird gave a clear cry and dove through the fissure, while the puppet's massive hand, which had nearly darkened the whole sky, slammed down toward Yang Kai at the same time.

Yang Kai faced that terrifying palm with a calm expression and made no move to dodge—not because he would not, but because he had no strength left. His skull felt as if it would split; repeatedly using Space Blades had taxed his Divine Sense unimaginably, and now the world before his eyes blurred like a mirage.

There was no longer any point in avoiding it.

In the next moment the Fire Bird artifact spirit slipped through the painstaking fissure Yang Kai had made and exploded its scorching power inside the puppet, burning it from within.

Red light leapt out over the puppet's surface like small serpents crawling, but soon the red glow vanished and the puppet's great hand froze in midair.

A crisp bird cry rang out as the Fire Bird rushed from inside the puppet, circled once above Yang Kai's head, and then dove into him.

Yang Kai's mouth twitched and exhaustion etched his face as he lay back on the ground.

Cai He and Du Sisi, swept up by the aftershock of the Hundred Mountains Painting's detonation, were roughed-up but not gravely injured. They struggled to their feet and watched the puppet's motion freeze; exchanging worried glances, they wondered how things had gone over on Yang Kai's side.

After releasing their Divine Sense to investigate, both of them let out a sigh of relief. Although they didn’t know exactly what had happened to Yang Kai, he still had a breath of life within him. As long as he was alive, it meant the puppet must have been rendered immobile—otherwise, how could Yang Kai possibly be unharmed?

Even as their excitement surged they remained shaken.

They all knew that annihilating an Origin Returning Realm puppet in an instant was no small feat, and none of them had fully estimated its toughness. Fortunately Yang Kai's attacks had taken effect; with their cooperation, bit by bit they had ground through the puppet's body and finally delivered the decisive blow.

After the fight neither Cai He nor Du Sisi had the energy to speak; Cai He only called out to Yang Kai to confirm he was unharmed, and with that the three settled into recuperation.

Half a day later Yang Kai rose first—not because he had suffered less, but because as an alchemist he carried countless restorative medicines in his Spatial Ring and his Golden Blood healed powerfully; his recovery naturally outpaced the two Formation Masters.

Glancing their way and seeing them still meditating, Yang Kai made no move to call them and instead jumped onto the giant puppet to examine it, stroking his chin as he inspected.

Such a puppet was clearly no common artifact. Even the Lian Clan could not have forged one like this. If one faced it in single combat, even an expert like Fei Zhi Tu might be no match.

That the three Saint King Realm cultivators had felled it this time owed largely to the two grand arrays that restrained it; without those bindings Yang Kai would have struggled even to stay alive, much less to destroy it.

Apart from the chest fissure, the puppet bore no other wounds.

Pondering, Yang Kai extended Divine Sense to envelope the puppet and sought to take it into his Spatial Ring, only to find it utterly immovable—much to his surprise.
