## Chapter 2017 — Gongsun Mu

Yang Kai had not expected such a thing to happen. Had this been outside, the creature might indeed have escaped.

But this was, after all, the Small Xuan Realm within the Xuan Realm Pearl.

So Yang Kai only paused for an instant before reaching out to grab it.

The Spiritual Qi of the Small Xuan Realm moved at his will, and the tiny figure flew less than three zhang before an invisible force held it in place. Even so, it struggled restlessly, high-pitched dragon roars issuing from within.

Only now did Yang Kai see its appearance clearly.

It was actually a True Dragon shrunk countless times—a crimson fire dragon wreathed in blazing flames!

Yang Kai was startled and cried out, "A young dragon?"

But soon he realized it was not so. The thing that looked like a "young dragon" twisted and condensed into a drop of deep-red substance. Only about the size of a fingernail, it resembled magma; even from three zhang away Yang Kai could feel its scorching power.

Yang Kai's expression shifted as if he recalled something. He cried out in shock, "Dragon blood—True Dragon blood!"

What was inside the jade bottle was not a young dragon, but a drop of genuine dragon blood.

From the earlier scene, this was clearly a drop of fire dragon blood! If a martial artist who cultivated fire-type power obtained it, it would absolutely be of tremendous benefit.

However, it was not completely useless to Yang Kai either.

Although Yang Kai did not primarily cultivate fire-type power, through the Yao Transformation Technique he could fuse True Dragon secret treasures. That genuine dragon scale had been fused into his body, covering the vital point at his heart.

He had long prepared to fuse the Dragon Bone sword into his body as well.

The Dragon Bone sword was refined from a True Dragon spine bone and a Dragon Pearl. Back then it had only been roughly refined, without damaging its foundation, so fusing it would pose no problem.

Fusing that dragon scale had given Yang Kai tremendous benefits. He had always been thinking about the Dragon Bone sword, but previously his strength had been insufficient to fuse with it. Later, when his strength had improved enough, he had not had much time.

Now he had actually obtained a drop of True Dragon blood.

If he could fuse with it properly, perhaps he could gain a portion of True Dragon might! After all, he possessed the Origin Power of the Golden Sacred Dragon within his body.

Yang Kai's expression changed, but deep in his heart he was greatly delighted.

Only now did he realize the jade bottle was no ordinary vessel. With a slight probe he sensed dense seals covering it, bitterly cold to the touch. In the palm there was no sensation, but when examined with Divine Sense it seemed capable of freezing the Divine Sense itself.

Only such a rare treasure could restrain a drop of dragon blood.

After pondering gravely, Yang Kai did not rush into fusing with it.

Previously, fusing the dragon scale via the Yao Transformation Technique had cost him greatly, so he resolved to first look up information before making any plans. Having decided, he carefully put the dragon blood away and his figure flickered as he left the Small Xuan Realm.

Over the next few days Yang Kai wandered the shops of Fenglin City, even visiting the black market several times.

The demonic beast materials he had taken from the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda were all sold, fetching a good sum of Source Crystals. He then spent a portion of that on many strange texts, returned to his cave, and shut his door to read.

The experiences since entering the Star Realm had made him realize he must quickly understand all kinds of information about the Star Realm, so although these texts were miscellaneous, they were exactly what he needed right now.

Among them were introductions to the major Sects of the Star Realm, secret realms, force distributions, terrain and geography, and even some medicinal herb diagrams.

This commonly known information was not hard to find. After a few days of reading, Yang Kai gained a general understanding of the Star Realm.

Some texts contained secret information, but Yang Kai could not tell whether it was true. Unfortunately he found little on the True Dragon race—only that within the Star Realm there lay a Dragon Isle where many of the Dragon Race dwelt.

As for information about fusing True Dragon secret treasures into the body, he found quite a bit.

Most warned that special techniques were required and results varied by person. Even a seeming success could consume the practitioner—if the constitution was unsuitable, the True Dragon treasure would devour them.

Yang Kai felt he should have no problems.

He possessed the Yao Transformation Technique as a special aid; his constitution was robust, and he bore the Origin Power of the Golden Sacred Dragon. The conditions for fusing with the True Dragon treasures were unusually favorable for him.

However, this matter could not be rushed. His top priority right now was still advancing to the Dao Origin Realm!

A Realm advancement would be enough to cause his strength to undergo earth-shaking changes.

Half a month passed.

Yang Kai left his cave and went to the Pill Shop. Per his prior agreement with Kang Siran, he entered the alchemist's workshop there to refine pills.

Ten days later, when Yang Kai finished refining the Spiritual Pills and stepped out of the alchemist's workshop, Kang Siran was already waiting with a smile.

"Shopkeeper Kang." Yang Kai cupped his fists slightly and greeted.

"Alchemist Yang, I've troubled you again this time." Kang Siran's mood seemed quite good, his smile causing wrinkles to form on his old face.

“It was merely an agreed matter, Shopkeeper Kang—you need not give it any mind,” Yang Kai said with a smile. “Judging by Shopkeeper Kang’s expression, has some happy occasion occurred?”

"Not exactly, but... the two alchemists dispatched from headquarters have already arrived five days ago."

"I see." Yang Kai understood. Kang Siran had been worrying about the Pill Shop's pill supply problem. Previously, all the alchemists in the workshop had been poached by the opponent Danqi Pavilion. If not for Yang Kai refining pills for him several times, the Pill Shop would likely have closed down. Now that the alchemists dispatched from the Ziyuan Commerce Guild headquarters had finally arrived, it had resolved Kang Siran's worries.

"Then I must congratulate Shopkeeper Kang." Yang Kai smiled.

Kang Siran chuckled and said, "If Alchemist Yang could stay and continue refining pills for the pill workshop, then this old man..."

Yang Kai waved his hand and said, "Shopkeeper Kang, I'm afraid that won't work. I told you before that I do not make a living from refining pills. The reason I agreed last time was because I needed pill formulas. Now that the two alchemists dispatched from your Commerce Guild headquarters have arrived, I will not come to refine pills in the future."

Hearing this, Kang Siran sighed, "That is a pity. In truth, with Alchemist Yang's ability, if you could focus on pill refining, your future achievements would likely not be much worse than Master Huangfu from headquarters."

Yang Kai smiled slightly.

“Since Alchemist Yang’s intention to leave is firm, this old one will say no more. The number of Spiritual Pills you refined before and this time is not small. As for how many Source Crystals should be allotted to you, this old one will make a careful accounting and have someone deliver them to your cave residence in due time.”

"Thank you." Yang Kai nodded. "Then I take my leave."

Kang Siran nodded and walked out together with Yang Kai.

Halfway there, Kang Siran suddenly said, "Alchemist Yang, this old man would like to ask presumptuously, do you need various pill formulas very much?"

"That's right. Does Shopkeeper Kang have connections?" Yang Kai's eyes lit up. "If Shopkeeper Kang has pill formulas for sale that I don't know, I can buy them. The price will definitely satisfy you."

Kang Siran chuckled. “Alchemist Yang has shown this old one great kindness. If I truly had any pill recipes, gifting them to you would be no issue at all—why speak of price?”

“Shopkeeper Kang has no pill recipes?” Yang Kai’s face was full of astonishment.

Kang Siran smiled mysteriously. "This old man doesn't have them, but I know of a place that should. Moreover, if that place is real, not only would there be a trove of pill formulas, perhaps... there would also be the legacy of a pill refining grandmaster!"

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai frowned.

"How about this, Alchemist Yang, come with me and I'll explain in detail." Kang Siran thought for a moment, then led Yang Kai toward his room.

Not long after, the two entered the room. Kang Siran had someone serve tea, then began to explain in detail.

After listening for a while, Yang Kai learned that Kang Siran actually held a piece of information about the existence of a cave dwelling. That cave dwelling was very likely the legacy cave dwelling of a pill refining grandmaster.

He had known of this for years but had lacked the strength to investigate deeply. Still, he had looked into it and personally gone to check; he was roughly eighty percent certain it was real.

"It really is a pill refining grandmaster's cave dwelling?" Yang Kai listened with a burning heart and asked urgently, "Then do you know which grandmaster's it is?"

"Gongsun Mu! I wonder if Alchemist Yang has heard of this person." Kang Siran slowly answered.

"Gongsun Mu?" Yang Kai frowned, recalling the texts he had read a few days ago. He seemed to have vaguely seen this name, but there was no very detailed description.

Seeing his expression, Kang Siran smiled slightly and said, "If Alchemist Yang hasn't heard of Gongsun Mu, then you must know that among the Ten Great Emperors, there is one whose pill refining technique was peerless and reached the peak."

"Great Emperor Miaodan?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

"That's right. Among the Ten Great Emperors, only Great Emperor Miaodan achieved the supreme peak through pill-refining, and is revered by all."

"Shopkeeper Kang, what relationship does Gongsun Mu have with Great Emperor Miaodan?" Yang Kai asked thoughtfully.

"That Gongsun Mu was one of the three disciples under Great Emperor Miaodan!" Kang Siran smiled slightly.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but change expression.

"Originally, this kind of secret, this old man had no right to know. However, over the years I have been investigating information about that cave dwelling, so I know a bit more than others. Gongsun Mu was the closed-door disciple of Great Emperor Miaodan, and also the youngest. Great Emperor Miaodan seemed to favor him greatly. However... I don't know how Gongsun Mu offended Great Emperor Miaodan, but three thousand years ago he was expelled from the Great Emperor's sect. In the end, he went into seclusion in the Southern Territory and met his end in a foreign land. How pitiable and lamentable."

"Gongsun Mu has such a great background. How did Shopkeeper Kang confirm that is his cave dwelling?" Although Yang Kai was shocked in his heart, he still cautiously asked.

Kang Siran smiled and said, "This old man naturally has his reasons. Let me put it this way: when Gongsun Mu was expelled from Great Emperor Miaodan's sect back then, he had a servant by his side who only took care of his daily life. However, that servant was later driven away by Gongsun Mu, whose temperament had greatly changed. The information this old man obtained came from the mouth of that servant's descendants."
