## Chapter 1476 — Mo Sea City

Huang Juan has lived here for several years and could be considered a local to some extent; she naturally knew the location of the Space Array like the back of her hand. With her leading the way, Yang Kai reached the palace where the Space Array was located without any trouble.

The Space Array in Haicheng City is open to outsiders as long as one pays enough Saint Crystals, though the set of reachable destinations is limited—only a handful of places.

After some deliberation, Yang Kai chose Black Crow City as the next stop.

It wasn’t because Black Crow City was the closest to Flowing Flame Sandland, but because Yang Kai had been there before and knew it lay not far from Qiantian Sect; by arriving at Black Crow City he could rely on Qiantian Sect’s power to easily teleport to the city closest to Flowing Flame Sandland.

It was a rather helpless choice, but also the most time-saving.

After paying a total of six hundred thousand Saint Crystals, the three of them stood on the Space Array; when the light flashed, the three vanished without a trace.

Yang Kai had once come to Black Crow City with Shen Shitao, Lü Ying and the others; it was in that city that he had a chance encounter with Qian Yue in the Hehuan House, made a ruckus, and redeemed her.

He had no intention of lingering. After confirming the direction, he led Huang Juan and Lin Yun'er and flew off in a certain direction.

Three days later, they landed before another city several times larger than Black Crow City.

"Sect Master, why have we come here?" Huang Juan stared at the three large characters above the great city gate with a puzzled expression.

"Hm. There are some acquaintances here; transferring through here is more convenient," Yang Kai explained lightly, glancing at Huang Juan’s back and the soundly sleeping Lin Yun'er with a faint smile.

Although the little girl hadn’t done any of the traveling, three days of journeying nevertheless exhausted her.

Besides, this was her first long trip; since her birth she had basically never left Haicheng City. So once she left Haicheng City that day, she was filled with immense curiosity about everything around her.

The high-speed flight thrilled her; she cheered and danced at seeing wildflowers and grasses, and at sighting birds and butterflies she couldn’t help but wish she could catch them to play with.

Excitement gave way to exhaustion. She slept like the dead.

"Let’s go." Yang Kai called, and led the way into the city.

Mo Sea City—adjacent to Qiantian Sect’s main headquarters—was as important to Qiantian Sect as Tianyun City was to Yingyue Hall. Mo Sea City was also controlled entirely by Qiantian Sect.

Shen Shitao had invited Yang Kai to visit many times before; he never had the chance or the time until now.

Before long, Yang Kai arrived at the front of Mo Sea City’s city lord mansion.

The mansion was one of the city’s showpiece buildings, built with imposing grandeur. Before it stood a row of warriors clad in black leather armor, faces solemn and holding silver spears, looking imposing.

Seeing Yang Kai and his two companions, they all turned their attention and approached; a man who seemed to lead them barked, "Halt! This is the Mo Sea City lord’s mansion; idlers and riffraff may not approach!"

This man cultivated to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm and stepped forward to stand before Yang Kai, eyeing him warily.

Yang Kai grinned and cupped his fist slightly, "Greetings, friend. I am Yang Kai. I have business with your city lord; could you announce me?"

"Business with the city lord?" The man’s brow twitched with impatience; most who came here were indeed seeking the city lord, and he knew that simply reporting the matter up without first inquiring risked punishment if he was wrong.

However, Yang Kai was of the Origin Returning Realm, so he dared not be too negligent; a weaker cultivator would have already been driven away.

"Do you know our city lord?" the man asked.

"Um… no, I don’t." Yang Kai admitted.

"You don’t?" The man looked astonished.

"But I know your Sect Master Gu Zhen." Yang Kai added.

"You know the Sect Master?" The man was shocked; over the years the Sect Master had been in seclusion and ordinary people had never seen him—indeed the man himself had never met the Sect Master. Hearing that someone named Yang Kai claimed to know the Sect Master seemed unbelievable.

"Yes, and I also know your Great Elder Mo Yu."

The man involuntarily inhaled sharply and once more appraised Yang Kai as if reassessing him; anyone who knew both the Sect Master and their Great Elder must be of high status—so why had he never seen this person before?

Though puzzled, he dared not delay further. His impatience vanished; he cupped his fists respectfully, "Please wait here a moment; I will report to the city lord right away."

"Much obliged." Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Not even half a tea later, the man hurried out from the mansion and a petite figure burst out and appeared before Yang Kai.

Seeing Yang Kai, the person exploded with joy, "Ah, it’s really you, Yang Kai—what brings you here?"

"Miss Lü Ying?" Yang Kai was surprised; he hadn’t expected the first to come out to meet him to be Lü Ying. Shen Shitao, who was always with her, was nowhere to be seen.

Since she was a familiar face, matters became easier—Yang Kai had been wondering how to verify his identity to the city lord.

"I was passing by and needed to use the Space Array; why are you here, Miss Lü Ying? Where is Miss Shen?" Yang Kai asked.

"Senior Sister Shen has been in seclusion since returning from the Imperial Garden. As for why I’m here, hee hee… the city lord of Mo Sea City is my father." Lü Ying replied with a giggle.

Yang Kai was stunned; he hadn’t expected Lü Ying to be of such status. He always thought she merely followed Shen Shitao and was her subordinate. He hadn’t realized her background was not small—her father being the city lord of Mo Sea City meant he was likely at least a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert.

"Impudent!" A commanding low scold came from within the mansion, and a fair-skinned middle-aged man strode out with a solemn mien and displeasure on his face, "Sect Master Yang is the head of a sect—how dare you speak so informally, girl?"

The man was clearly Lü Ying’s father, the city lord of Mo Sea City.

Hearing the rebuke, Lü Ying stuck out her tongue playfully, looking mischievous.

Yang Kai chuckled, "City Lord, you overstate. Lü Ying and I have known each other a long time; we’re peers, no need for formality simply because I’ve founded a sect."

Hearing this, the middle-aged man’s eyes lit up, clearly pleased by Yang Kai’s humility and courteous demeanor. Even so, he shook his head and said, “That may be so, but propriety must not be neglected. Ying’er, properly greet Sect Master Yang again.”

At those words, Lü Ying’s lips curled almost to the heavens, yet she couldn’t defy her father’s command—so, wearing a look of clear reluctance, she gave another formal salute.

Yang Kai felt helpless; although he had only exchanged a few words with the city lord, he could see the man was rather stiff.

Once Lü Ying finished her salute, the middle-aged man cupped his fists and said, “I am Lü Xuan, City Lord of Mo Sea City. It is an honor to meet Sect Master Yang.”

"City Lord, you are too polite. I came here uninvited—please don’t take offense" Yang Kai returned the greeting quickly.

"Sect Master Yang flatters us. Your presence brings honor to Mo Sea City. Please come inside. I have already sent word to the Sect Master and Great Elder; they should arrive within half an hour. Please wait a while, Sect Master Yang."

"Very well." Yang Kai inclined his head lightly; he wasn’t concerned—he had rescued Gu Zhen and Mo Yu in the Imperial Garden, and they would certainly come once informed.

Entering the mansion, they were flanked and escorted, a lively scene.

Seeing the three dusty travelers, Lü Xuan arranged for them to bathe and change. Yang Kai wouldn’t refuse; he didn’t care about his own dirtiness, but it would be improper for Lin Yun'er and Huang Juan to remain in such a state.

After some fuss, Yang Kai appeared refreshed in a palace hall. By then Gu Zhen and Mo Yu had already arrived, and after greetings the usual small talk followed.

Before long, guests and hosts took their seats; Lü Xuan had prepared a welcoming feast with exquisite dishes and spirit fruits, and the inexperienced Lin Yun'er’s appetite was whetted and she devoured everything.

The frank little girl’s behaviour was not annoying but rather amusing; Lü Ying sat beside Lin Yun'er, constantly serving her and clearly fond of the child.

Huang Juan, however, behaved very reservedly. She had never imagined that one day she would sit at the same table with Qiantian Sect’s leaders. Only days ago she had been impoverished and begged for a single five-thousand-Saint-Crystal Spiritual Pill; now she had transformed.

She knew deeply that this treatment was all thanks to Yang Kai, and a thousand emotions swelled in her heart.

A few hours later, as dusk fell and the feast ended, Lin Yun'er—sated—was led away to rest by Huang Juan, leaving only Yang Kai and several Qiantian Sect elders in the great hall.

"Has Miss Shen returned?" Yang Kai sipped fragrant tea and asked with concern.

"Thanks to Sect Master Yang, the three of us returned unharmed," Gu Zhen replied gratefully. The Imperial Garden trip had been fraught with danger, the most perilous moment being the battle in which Yang Kai intervened; had Yang Kai not saved them at the crucial moment, Gu Zhen and Mo Yu might have been okay, but the weakest, Shen Shitao, would have met a dire fate.

However, Shen Shitao entered seclusion upon returning because she had benefited from the Imperial Garden and had only recently advanced to the Origin Returning Realm; her strength had not yet solidified, so she dared not delay refining it—therefore she did not come out to meet Yang Kai this time.
