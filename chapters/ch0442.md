## Chapter 442 — A Maiden’s First Love Is Most Moving

The True Alchemy Formula was immensely profound. It contained not only various miraculous alchemy spirit formations but also the accumulated life experiences and insights of countless alchemy masters. These were enough for Yang Kai to benefit from throughout his lifetime. However, extracting such information from the True Alchemy Formula consumed an enormous amount of Divine Sense power.

With the continuous replenishment and consumption of Divine Sense, his mastery naturally improved rapidly.

Time passed swiftly. With a large stockpile of resources as backup, both Yang Kai’s cultivation and Divine Sense power were growing at a plainly evident pace.

Every morning at sunrise, Yang Kai would practice the Proud Bone Golden Body Technique, and without fail, he would consume a drop of Wan Yao Ling Ye daily.

After such a long time of accumulation, the effects of Wan Yao Ling Ye in cleansing and refining his meridians and marrow had begun to reveal themselves. This made Yang Kai’s cultivation faster and more efficient than ever before.

Moreover, this effect would last his entire life, a boundless benefit. With his future power increasing, the effects of continuing to consume Wan Yao Ling Ye daily would snowball into even greater gains.

War City, to the east, lay the manor of the First Brother of the Yang Family, Yang Wei.

After several days of seclusion, Yang Wei felt restless and stepped outside to walk. There, he saw Meng Shanyi of the Meng Family standing in his courtyard, seemingly waiting for him, pacing back and forth with a furrowed brow, deep in thought.

“Brother Meng,” Yang Wei greeted.

“The Young Master,” Meng Shanyi responded joyfully, quickening his pace. Then his eyes brightened as he said, “It seems Young Master has made a breakthrough in his cultivation method again.”

Yang Wei nodded lightly and said calmly, “Yes. Approaching the Second Stage of Divine Roaming. It should be within days.”

Meng Shanyi couldn’t help but feel both admiration and envy. Though he was the Meng Family’s legitimate eldest son and of decent talent, he was still only at the Ninth Stage of True Yuan, just nearly breaking into Divine Roaming. Compared to Yang Wei of the Yang Family, the First Brother, he was still no match.

In this generation of Zhongdu’s young talents, several were truly exceptional, Meng Shanyi thought with a sigh.

Liu Qingyao of the Liu Family needed no mention, and Qiu Yimeng, the young lady of the Qiu Family, had also broken into the First Stage of Divine Roaming two months ago. Others had yet to reach Divine Roaming, but were close.

This awakened a sense of crisis within him.

Although he was a Meng Family scion and could rely on his status even if weak, which man did not wish to grow stronger?

“What brings you here?” Yang Wei inquired.

“Young Master, since your arrival at War City, you’ve been in seclusion. The others have come over; they all wish to see you,” Meng Shanyi said.

“I’ll arrange a meeting with them shortly,” Yang Wei nodded gently.

Meng Shanyi excitedly asked, “Does this mean Young Master plans to take action?”

“What action?” Yang Wei looked at him suspiciously.

Meng Shanyi frowned. “Don’t you want to attack Yang Quan? Yang Kai is reluctant to rise too quickly to avoid attracting too much attention. Besides you, everyone else is recuperating. Now is a rare opportunity. If you bring your comrades over, I believe Yang Quan won’t resist. After all, you are the First Brother; your brothers respect you greatly.”

Yang Quan had only one Divine Roaming Eighth Stage Blood Servant. His mother’s family was merely a second-rate power. Such defensive strength was no match for Yang Wei now.

“Attacking Eighth Brother now would definitely succeed,” Yang Wei agreed without refuting Meng Shanyi’s view. “Even if he resists, he cannot.”

“Then what are you hesitating for?” Meng Shanyi was puzzled.

“There’s little benefit in it; I won’t do it!” Yang Wei shook his head. “Let’s drop this topic. When the time comes to strike, I will. Meng brother, come with me to meet those people now.”

He stood.

Though Meng Shanyi was somewhat frustrated, he had no further words. Yet how could there be no benefit in conquering Yang Quan? Not to mention that Yang Quan himself and his command flag could be exchanged with the family for supplies, defeating him would also rally his current allies.

There was clearly much to gain!

Three hundred li from War City.

In a wilderness, two dignified and charming beauties walked together, chatting and laughing. Beside them were two pure maidens. One was more lively, calling Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan by their names and engaging in amusing topics that caused the two beauties to laugh charmingly.

The other maiden was serene. She wore a First Stage veil, hiding her true face, but her bright, watery eyes enchanted all who saw them. A pale blue gemstone adorned her forehead, enhancing her ethereal beauty, as if she were a celestial maiden descended upon the mortal world, untouched by worldly dust.

As she gazed toward War City, anticipation and joy filled her eyes, faint shyness blooming within. Memories of a certain figure stirred, bringing a blush to her unveiled cheeks.

A maiden’s first love is most moving.

At this moment, she was at the most beautiful point in her life. Even the two beauties nearby could not help but be stunned by her appearance.

The more vivacious maiden suddenly ran up, linking arms with the veiled girl, giggling, “Sister Xia, are you thinking about my cousin?”

Xia Ningshang blushed deeply, her delicate earlobes turning scarlet, stammering, “N-no, I’m not. Don’t say that.”

“Heh heh,” Dong Qingyan grinned slyly. “You say you’re not, but just mentioning him made your face go bright red.”

“Am I blushing?” Xia Ningshang hastily covered her cheeks, then suddenly recalled she was still veiled. Even if blushing, no one could see. Yet, her cheeks truly felt hot.

“Look how nervous you are.” Dong Qingyan teased relentlessly. “Sister Xia, what do you like about my cousin? He seems pretty ordinary to me.”

“I don’t like him at all,” Xia Ningshang wrinkled her nose, firmly denying.

“But when you heard about his participation in the succession war, you immediately wanted to leave Hidden Cloud Peak. Master will miss you; if you leave, no one will be around to discuss alchemy with him.”

“I’m his Senior Sister. It’s natural for a Senior Sister to care for her Junior Brother,” Xia Ningshang bit her lip and replied softly, although the reason sounded too weak even to herself.

Aunt Xiang and Aunt Lan overheard the conversation and couldn’t help but smile.

They were very fond of Xia Ningshang, a quiet, innocent maiden. Both beauties had no children and, during the months on Hidden Cloud Peak, had treated her as their own daughter. They knew of her feelings for Yang Kai and approved.

They believed only a young master from the Yang Family was worthy of someone like Xia Ningshang and capable of protecting her.

“Really don’t like him?” Dong Qingyan playfully rolled her eyes.

Xia Ningshang nodded reluctantly.

“That’s great. Then I can marry my cousin!” Dong Qingyan laughed, saying something earth-shattering.

“Ah…” Xia Ningshang was shocked, looking at Dong Qingyan dumbfounded.

“Alright, Qingyan, don’t tease Sister Xia anymore. If you keep it up, she’ll cry,” Aunt Xiang said sternly, pulling Dong Qingyan aside and then softly comforting Xia Ningshang, “Don’t listen to her nonsense. She’s lying.”

Xia Ningshang lightly nodded and smiled faintly, “If Dong is to marry Junior Brother, that’s fine too. You are all relatives, and a marriage would only make us closer.”

Dong Qingyan was at a loss, hastily waving her hands. “No way! That stinky cousin isn’t someone I’d want. I want someone ordinary and who loves only me for a lifetime. Only then can I be happy.”

Aunt Xiang was quietly surprised at Xia Ningshang’s generosity. This girl clearly cared deeply for Yang Kai. Her yearning on Hidden Cloud Peak was heart-wrenching to witness, yet when hearing someone might marry Yang Kai, she not only did not oppose it but smiled softly.

What a curious matter.
