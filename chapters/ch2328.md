## Chapter 2328 — Corpse Puppet

Yang Kai was quite interested in the many techniques and secret arts of the Thousand Leaves Sect, as they involved the path of puppetry—a domain he had never explored before.

Now, with these techniques and secret arts before him, Yang Kai was tempted.

However, he secretly resolved to only study and comprehend them for a while before taking them out to return to Ye Hen, with no intention of keeping them for himself.

With this in mind, Yang Kai held his breath, focused his mind, and reached out to grab the ring on the corpse’s hand.

But at that moment, his heart suddenly leapt, and an intense sense of unease spread through his body, making his hair stand on end. Instinctively, he pushed off with his foot, drifting backward to put distance between himself and the corpse.

In the next instant, his eyes narrowed as he witnessed a scene that chilled him to the bone.

The formation beneath the corpse suddenly hummed and burst with dazzling light, as if activated by some unknown cause. Immediately after, runes and formation patterns appeared on the corpse’s surface, outlining a mysterious array. The corpse’s withered, almost moistureless body instantly took on a metallic sheen.

Boom... The array inexplicably began to operate, and a dense crackling sound like beans being fried came from within the corpse. Eyes that had been shut for countless years suddenly snapped open.

Those eyes glowed emerald green, like two ghostly flames flickering, striking fear into all who saw them.

The powerful aura of the Emperor Realm erupted from the corpse, crashing into Yang Kai like a tangible force.

Yang Kai felt as if a mountain was pressing down on his chest, unbearably heavy.

He knew things had taken a turn for the worse. This corpse, dead for who knew how many years, had likely developed its own intelligence, becoming something akin to a Corpse Spirit.

Years ago, on Dark Star, he had encountered such monsters. At that time, the Corpse Spirit race had appeared out of nowhere, wreaking havoc on Dark Star. Countless cultivators were infected by corpse poison and transformed into their kind. In the end, it was Yang Kai who turned the tide and eradicated the disaster.

But back then, the strongest Corpse Spirit was only a Thousand-Year Corpse General, with cultivation at the Origin Returning Realm. Compared to the Corpse Spirit before him, it was nothing.

The one before him was a true Ten-Thousand-Year Corpse King!

And it was an Emperor Realm Ten-Thousand-Year Corpse King—the Emperor Intent enveloping him was absolutely real.

Realizing this, Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat, knowing the situation was dire. He dared not hesitate any longer. Spatial Law swirled around him as he prepared to escape the cave.

In an instant, his figure began to blur.

But before he could flee, the Corpse King, who had been sitting cross-legged, suddenly let out a piercing, vicious screech. The sound contained some strange power, sweeping out in all directions and forming an invisible cage that locked down the area.

Yang Kai’s body stiffened, and his blurred figure became clear again!

His expression changed drastically—his spatial technique had been broken by the opponent with ease. He dared not delay and could only rush outward in a panic.

The Corpse King’s ghostly eyes shone with a cold light, staring at him. Its mouth opened, and a jet of emerald green mist shot out.

“Corpse poison!” Yang Kai cried out in alarm. He finally understood what the foul smell he had noticed upon entering the cave was.

That stench was clearly the Corpse King’s corpse poison. Just a trace of it leaking from its body had already made him feel poisoned and dizzy. Now, with a full blast, if he accidentally inhaled it, he would surely die instantly.

Terrified, Yang Kai dared not breathe and frantically circulated his Origin Qi to form a protective barrier around himself, retreating like an arrow released from a bow.

He was fast, but the jet of corpse poison was equally swift, catching up and striking his protective Origin Qi.

With a sizzling sound, the Origin Qi on Yang Kai’s body melted away like snow under the blazing sun, leaving a gaping hole. The corpse poison seeped in through the breach.

Yang Kai could hardly believe such corrosive force.

In this moment of crisis, his eyes widened in fury. He thrust out a hand, pushing his spatial power to the limit, and shouted, “Banish!”

Under the power of law, a black hole appeared before him, swallowing all the incoming corpse poison. His body flickered as he dashed out of the cave, returning to the valley.

He barely had time to catch his breath before beast-like roars echoed from the cave—the violent, cruel aura of the Corpse King rapidly approached, and the cave itself shook as stones tumbled down.

“What grudge do you have against me?” Yang Kai wore a bitter expression, knowing he had kicked an iron plate. If he had known, he would never have explored the cave and provoked such a monster.

There was no need to fight—Yang Kai knew he was no match. His only hope was to escape to the Formation Foundation platform in the secret realm, repair it quickly, and teleport out to survive.

But repairing it would take time. Even with his deep mastery of spatial power, he still needed to refine some materials to mend the sword marks. That time was more than enough for the Corpse King to kill him a hundred times over.

This was the corpse of a Third Stage of the Emperor Realm expert transformed into a Corpse King! Yang Kai had no idea how strong it truly was.

Boom...

With a loud bang, the Corpse King burst out of the cave, formation patterns swirling on its body and emitting eerie light. It appeared before Yang Kai in an instant, its fangs gleaming coldly as it swung a fierce punch at him.

Yang Kai’s face turned pale as he felt the terrifying power contained in that simple punch. There was no time to dodge; in desperation, he summoned the Myriad Sword, poured Origin Qi into it, and shouted, “A million swords unleashed—one man holds the pass!”

This was the strongest defensive move of the Myriad Sword. Yang Kai had used it several times before and knew its power well.

The sword curtain spread out, forming a solid barrier before Yang Kai. Countless sword energies became an impregnable fortress, blocking any storm that came his way.

Boom...

The Corpse King’s fist smashed down, and the sword curtain Yang Kai had poured all his strength into was as fragile as paper, instantly shattered. An indescribable force crashed in from the front, making Yang Kai feel as if a mountain was crushing him. Against this power, his Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation was as insignificant as an ant.

Death! The thought flashed through Yang Kai’s mind.

No matter how strong his body was, no matter how abundant his Origin Qi, if he took that punch head-on, he would die without a doubt.

It was an irrational intuition, but Yang Kai believed it completely.

At the brink of life and death, Yang Kai forcibly activated his spatial power, shifting himself just enough to avoid the center of the punch’s force.

It was not that he did not want to teleport away entirely, but under the suppression of the opponent’s Emperor Intent, he was powerless to do so. Achieving even this much was his limit.

The explosion sounded as if even space was shattered. Two crisp cracks came from within Yang Kai’s body—two ribs broke at once. He flew backward like a rag doll, spitting blood, his breath weakening greatly.

With a thud, Yang Kai hit the ground but quickly struggled to his feet, clutching his chest, his expression pained.

Just one exchange had shown him how overwhelmingly strong the Corpse King was. If it pressed the attack now, his situation would only get worse.

But to Yang Kai’s slight relief, after knocking him away, the Corpse King stood still, its ghostly eyes flickering, its wooden expression twisting into a hideous grimace.

What was it doing?

Yang Kai did not understand, but it was exactly what he hoped for. He quickly took a healing Spiritual Pill from his Spatial Ring, swallowed it, and used the opportunity to regulate his breathing.

He dared not move recklessly, fearing that any action might provoke the Corpse King and ruin his chance to recover.

While recuperating, he kept a close eye on the Corpse King’s movements.

He noticed that ever since the Corpse King had emerged from the cave, its corpse poison had begun to spread in all directions. Any plants in the valley that had survived for tens of thousands of years withered and died upon contact, turning yellow and shriveling in the blink of an eye—proof of the poison’s potency.

But Yang Kai also noticed something strange: this Ten-Thousand-Year Corpse King... seemed to lack intelligence.

He could not understand it. Back on Dark Star, the Corpse Spirits he encountered could already think for themselves after just a thousand years, so why couldn’t this tens-of-thousands-year-old Corpse King?

Moreover, the formation patterns on its body were intriguing, and the metallic sheen on its withered frame was bizarre, as if its body was truly made of metal, not just dried flesh.

As he watched, Yang Kai’s eyes suddenly widened, and a chilling thought popped into his mind. He blurted out, “Corpse Puppet?”

Although Yang Kai had not studied the path of puppetry much, after so many years of cultivation, he had heard a thing or two.

Ordinary puppets were usually refined from various heaven-and-earth treasures using special methods. The Thousand Leaves Sect’s puppets, and those Yang Kai had encountered in the Time Temple, were of this type.

But there was another kind of puppet, not made from heaven-and-earth treasures, but from the bodies of cultivators.

The bodies of powerful cultivators were the best materials for refining puppets—their tight structure, formidable cultivation and will before death could not be replaced by mere treasures.

Some evil cultivators were obsessed with refining the corpses of experts into puppets, using them to kill their enemies. After being refined, these puppets could retain much of their former cultivation and abilities, displaying immense power.
