## Chapter 2161 — Parting Ways

At a glance, the once arrogant and domineering Blood Monster was now bound up like a zongzi by countless golden coins.

Seeing this, Yang Kai vaguely sensed what Kong Qi was about to do next and quickly darted off into the distance.

Sure enough, just as he moved, Kong Qi suddenly shouted in a deep voice, "Die!"

As soon as the words fell, a buzzing sound rang out.

In that instant, the countless golden coins seemed to turn into incomparably sharp blades, suddenly tightening and slicing through the Blood Monster’s body…

The golden light faded, and all those coins merged back into a single one, which Kong Qi retrieved.

But the Blood Monster, still standing in place, suddenly collapsed with a crash. As it fell, its body turned into pieces as thin as cicada wings, dissolving into pus and flowing all over the floor.

The hall was soon filled with a nauseating stench.

“Not worth a single blow!” Kong Qi landed gracefully from midair, snorting coldly. If not for his slightly pale face, his words would have been even more convincing.

That last move had clearly cost him quite a bit as well.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and was about to say something to him when his expression suddenly changed. He focused and looked around.

“What’s wrong?” Kong Qi frowned, seeing Yang Kai so startled.

“Brother Kong… didn’t you notice? The restriction in this room hasn’t been lifted.” Yang Kai glanced at the exit and asked.

Reminded by this, Kong Qi belatedly looked around and said in surprise, “You’re right. Why is that?”

“Two possibilities!” Yang Kai’s face darkened as he looked at him solemnly. “First, this restriction is inherent to the room and has nothing to do with the Blood Monster. So even if it’s dead, the barrier hasn’t disappeared.”

“And the other possibility…” Kong Qi wasn’t stupid. He immediately understood what Yang Kai meant, and as he spoke, he looked down and shouted, “It’s not dead!”

As soon as he finished, the pool of blood-red pus on the ground began to flow and squirm rapidly, pouring into the pool at the center of the room as if it were alive.

“It really isn’t dead?” Kong Qi was shocked.

The Blood Monster had already been sliced into countless thin pieces by his secret technique and Secret Treasure, yet it still wasn’t destroyed. Its strangeness was evident.

“That blood pool is the key!” Yang Kai seemed to realize something.

As he spoke, the blood in the pool kept boiling and bubbling. Judging by the look of it, another Blood Monster was about to be born from within.

“What a hassle!” Kong Qi couldn’t help but take a few steps back, his face wary. He suggested, “Why don’t we join forces, break the restriction, and get out of here first!”

Faced with such a bizarre, nearly unkillable thing, Kong Qi really didn’t want to fight it anymore.

Yang Kai stood where he was, unmoved.

“Are you listening to me?” Kong Qi frowned and shouted.

“Oh…” Yang Kai finally responded, “No need to go through all that trouble. I suddenly have a great idea!”

“What?” Kong Qi asked in surprise.

But Yang Kai didn’t answer him. Instead, he walked to the front of the blood pool, struck a strange pose, stretched out his hand, and reached forward, gathering his energy and shouting, “Haina Divine Art, absorb for me!”

“What the hell?” Kong Qi’s mouth twitched uncontrollably. He really didn’t know what to say about Yang Kai. With his experience, he had never heard of a technique called Haina Divine Art. It was either something Yang Kai made up or a worthless, low-grade technique.

But in the next moment, a scene that nearly made Kong Qi’s eyes pop out unfolded.

The churning blood in the pool was actually being sucked up by Yang Kai, continuously pouring into his palm and disappearing!

The blood in the pool churned even more violently, and faint roars and struggles could be heard. But since the Blood Monster’s body hadn’t fully formed, it couldn’t resist and could only be drawn toward Yang Kai’s palm by a mysterious force.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s palm was like a bottomless pit, accepting all that evil blood.

Kong Qi was dumbfounded, waves of shock surging in his heart. He kept rubbing his eyes, telling himself it was an illusion…

But no matter how he looked, the scene before him was all too real.

Meanwhile, while Yang Kai maintained that strange posture, he held the Xuan Realm Pearl in his palm out of Kong Qi’s sight and communicated with his Incarnation via Divine Sense: “Are you sure you can refine all this?”

The Incarnation replied, “There’s an immense amount of energy in this blood. It’s extremely useful to me. The Heaven Devouring Battle Art devours all things—how could mere blood be an exception? I’ve even refined two Dao Origin Realm cultivators!”

“Alright, since you say so…” Yang Kai said no more. If his Incarnation hadn’t suddenly sent him a message, he wouldn’t have used the Xuan Realm Pearl to absorb all the blood into the Small Xuan Realm. He paused and reminded, “But be careful. Don’t let those evil thoughts corrupt your Divine Sense!”

“I understand.”

In the hall, Kong Qi’s expression kept shifting—shock, suspicion, astonishment, horror…

As time passed, the pool of blood, along with the faint wails, soon disappeared.

At the same time, the barrier sealing the room broke on its own.

Once all the blood was absorbed, Yang Kai drew a circle with his hands, settled his breath in his Dantian, and struck a finishing pose.

After turning around, he even patted his belly and burped, looking as if he’d eaten his fill.

Kong Qi’s face turned green at the sight…

“Brother Kong, it’s been a pleasure working with you! As expected of an elite from the Qiyao Commerce Guild, that Coinfall move just now truly opened my eyes. Your reputation is well deserved…” At this point, he tilted his head at Kong Qi. “Why are you making that face?”

Kong Qi’s mouth twitched. “I just want to ask, is your body… having any strange reactions?”

“Nope!” Yang Kai replied, walking forward as he spoke.

Kong Qi quickly retreated a few steps, raising his hand. “Don’t come over. Just talk from there.”

If Kong Qi’s attitude toward Yang Kai had been wary and annoyed before, now it was pure disgust… He looked at Yang Kai as if he were a maggot crawling out of a cesspit, unable to look directly at him.

“Brother Kong, it seems you’re rather particular about cleanliness.” Yang Kai grinned, his tone full of implication.

“This has nothing to do with cleanliness!” Kong Qi forced down his discomfort and replied at lightning speed. After speaking, he immediately pinched his nose and mouth shut.

“By the way, there’s something else I should tell you, Brother Kong. As for that spiritual fruit, you’d better wait until you return and consult your Commerce Guild elders to identify its type and effects before making any plans. Don’t eat it lightly.” Yang Kai changed the subject, reminding him with concern.

After all, although those two Fruits of Time looked the same, they were actually quite different. The one Yang Kai gave to Kong Qi… had a tiny problem.

If Kong Qi suffered because of it, Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to escape responsibility.

“You don’t need to remind me about that.” Kong Qi frowned, secretly feeling Yang Kai was a bit too concerned.

“That’s good.” Yang Kai grinned. “Now that things here are settled, why don’t we…”

But before Yang Kai could finish, Kong Qi cupped his fists and said, “Farewell!”

He turned and dashed out of the hall.

He couldn’t even be bothered with the usual pleasantries. It was as if he never wanted to see Yang Kai again.

“He sure ran fast!” Yang Kai muttered to himself as he watched Kong Qi disappear. After pondering for a moment, he didn’t turn back but instead followed in the direction Kong Qi had left.

Although he accidentally chose the same fork as Kong Qi, it was probably too late to go back now. The other cultivators had likely escaped the illusion array and entered different forks.

Even if he chose again, he’d still end up on the same path as someone else, so he might as well not waste time.

Beyond the hall was still a corridor dotted with strange stones. There seemed to be a few minor restrictions along the way, but they had all been broken by Kong Qi, who went ahead.

Yang Kai made it through without incident.

After walking for about half an hour, Yang Kai suddenly raised his eyebrows and grinned at a figure standing ahead. “Brother Kong, why are you waiting for me here? Did you run into trouble?”

“No.” Kong Qi felt a strange sense of panic as Yang Kai approached. He took a few steps back and said, “There’s a fork here. Which way are you going?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai looked ahead and saw that there really was a fork, though there were only two paths.

His eyes turned, and he immediately understood why Kong Qi had deliberately waited here.

This guy clearly didn’t want to walk the same path as him, so he waited to confirm, even at the cost of wasting time.

“Which path do you want to take, Brother Kong?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

Kong Qi’s mouth twitched. “Whichever you take, I’ll take the other!”

“I see… I was hoping to go with you…”

“Let’s not talk about that!” Kong Qi hurriedly interrupted, his expression cold. “Hurry up and choose. Don’t dawdle!”

“Then I’ll take this one.” Yang Kai casually pointed to the right fork.

As soon as he finished, Kong Qi darted into the left fork and quickly disappeared.

“What a character!” Yang Kai chuckled as he watched him go, then turned and stepped into the right fork.

Actually, even if Kong Qi hadn’t waited here, Yang Kai would have chosen a different path. Although it was nice to have someone clearing the way, if there were any benefits, they’d all go to the person in front, which wasn’t what Yang Kai wanted.

The journey was fairly peaceful. Although there were a few minor restrictions, Yang Kai managed to break through them smoothly.

At a certain moment, a light suddenly appeared ahead. Yang Kai’s spirits lifted as he looked up and saw what looked like a door, with dazzling light shining from within.
