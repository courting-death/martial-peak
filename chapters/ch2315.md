## Chapter 2315 — No Need To Be So Vicious

“A teachable child!” Yang Kai laughed heartily, patting Yuan Mo’s head as a reward.

Yuan Mo, however, thought Yang Kai was about to kill him. Terrified, he shuddered all over, his eyes rolled back, and he fainted on the spot.

“Useless!” Luo Jin cursed through gritted teeth.

Yang Kai turned his head and gazed coldly at the others, his eyes chilling.

Before he could speak, those few immediately started shouting over each other: “Young Master Yang, I now fully understand how to write the word ‘death’!”

“It is my greatest honor to witness Young Master Yang’s true skill.”

“Young Master Yang is truly extraordinary, to use blood as ink and write such fine characters—admirable, admirable!”

Each of them fawned as much as they could, their mouths full of flattery, but their forced smiles were uglier than tears. Clearly, they were terrified, afraid Yang Kai would kill them if he was even slightly displeased.

The many guests all looked at them with contempt, pained by their shamelessness.

But then, thinking further, if they were in the same situation, would they do any better? With a blade at your neck, what use is dignity or loyalty? Survival is the only way! Realizing this, many sighed inwardly, knowing these people weren’t just cowardly, but simply outmatched by the situation.

“Since you all know how to write ‘death,’ then get lost! Don’t sully this Young Master’s eyes!” Yang Kai’s smile vanished as he snapped impatiently.

Those few, as if granted amnesty, scrambled back into the crowd, not daring to show their faces again.

Only then did Yang Kai turn around, looking coldly at Luo Jin. “Hand them over, or you know the consequences!”

Luo Jin remained unmoved, merely snorting coldly. “Is this how your elders taught you to speak to your seniors?”

Yang Kai replied, “I’ve always respected the old and cherished the young, but if City Lord doesn’t know what’s good for him, don’t blame me for beating you until even your mother can’t recognize you.”

As he spoke, he walked toward Luo Jin, unhurried but clearly unwilling to waste time. He wanted to end this quickly.

A trace of nervousness flashed across Luo Jin’s face. Though his cultivation was a Stage higher than Yang Kai’s, he had seen what Yang Kai was capable of and knew this youth was not to be trifled with. As Yang Kai drew closer, Luo Jin immediately looked in a certain direction and called out, “Master Ke, please lend me a hand. Luo will be eternally grateful!”

He knew that asking those at the First or Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm for help was pointless, so he directly called upon a Dao Origin Third Stage expert he was close with. In this situation, only a Third Stage could suppress Yang Kai.

As Luo Jin finished speaking, an old man slowly stepped out from the crowd. His hair and beard were white, his aura restrained, his eyes bright, and his face ruddy—he looked every bit the dignified elder.

He smiled slightly. “Since Lord Luo has asked, this old man will naturally comply.”

A hint of joy flashed in Luo Jin’s eyes. He nodded, “Many thanks!”

Yang Kai also stopped, turning to look at the old man with a smile. “Old sir, you want to get involved in this?”

The old man surnamed Ke smiled, “It’s better to resolve enmity than create it. Young Brother, if you don’t mind, why not all sit down and talk things over? This old body isn’t what it used to be and can’t compare to you young people. If possible, I’d rather not fight.”

“Sure!” Yang Kai grinned. “Then, old sir, just sit to the side, have some wine, eat a little—how about it?”

The old man surnamed Ke said, “I’m afraid that won’t do. Since Lord Luo has spoken, I can’t just stand by.”

Yang Kai sighed, “Old sir, you’ve lived so many years, it can’t have been easy. Even the underworld doesn’t want you yet, so why rush to the gates of hell?”

The old man narrowed his eyes, “You’re quite spirited, young man, and very confident. If I’m not mistaken, you must be the master who refined the Supreme Mystic Pill?”

It wasn’t strange that the old man could guess Yang Kai’s identity. Lately, Yang Kai’s name had spread throughout the Southern Territory. He had even introduced himself in front of everyone earlier, arousing suspicion. After he broke free from the binding formation using spatial power, the old man naturally confirmed it.

The old man wasn’t the only one who guessed Yang Kai’s identity—others had as well, but simply hadn’t said it aloud.

Some who didn’t know the truth gasped in shock, their eyes filled with awe and excitement as they looked at Yang Kai.

What was the Supreme Mystic Pill? Previously, no one knew, but after the events in Four Seasons Land, its effects became widely known. It was a long-lost divine pill that could help one break through to the Emperor Realm. Aside from the few Yang Kai had refined, there was no chance of finding another in the world.

“What? He’s the one who refined the Supreme Mystic Pill?” Luo Jin’s expression changed, and he exclaimed belatedly.

The old man surnamed Ke said, “Same name, same cultivation at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and skilled in alchemy—besides that master, I can’t think of anyone else with such ability.”

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow and said, “It’s just a humble name—not worth mentioning!”

“So it really is you!” Luo Jin’s eyes suddenly shone with a burning light, as if Yang Kai had become a delicious treat.

The old man said, “Master Yang’s name is like thunder to my ears. I’ve admired you for a long time. Today is also the City Lord’s joyous day, so it’s really not suitable to fight. Master Yang, could you give this old man some face and let today’s matter end here?”

Yang Kai laughed, “Give you face? And who gives me face! If the City Lord insists on forcibly marrying your mother-in-law, regardless of her wishes, old sir, how would you feel?”

The old man’s smile vanished, and he said angrily, “I am old, and my mother-in-law has long since passed away. Young man, mind your tongue—there’s no need to be so vicious.”

“Sorry, sorry!” Yang Kai looked apologetic, as if sincerely admitting fault, but then changed the subject: “Then what if the City Lord wanted to marry your wife?”

The old man trembled, his aura surging as he roared, “Insolence!”

Yang Kai sneered, “He didn’t actually marry your wife, I was just speaking casually, and you’re already so furious, looking like you want to kill. Yet he did such a despicable thing to my mother-in-law—do you think I can let him off easily?”

Luo Jin shouted, “Master Ke, no need to waste words with him. Let’s join forces and capture him first!”

The old man replied, “Very well!”

The two exchanged a glance, unwilling to say more. Luo Jin once again took out that Jade Scepter-like Secret Treasure, while the old man flipped his hand and summoned a token-shaped object. It was only palm-sized, but arcs of lightning danced across its surface, giving off an extremely dangerous feeling.

“Be careful, Young Master Yang! Ke Tian is the Great Elder of Heavenly Extreme Hall. That Thunder Order seals the Nine Heavens Divine Thunder—don’t try to block it head-on!” Ye Qinghan shouted a warning from the side.

Ke Tian glared at Ye Qinghan, shouting, “Shut up, girl, or you’ll regret it!”

Ye Qinghan retorted disdainfully, “Bullying the weak with numbers, relying on strength to oppress—so this is the kind of despicable, shameless person the Great Elder Ke is? I used to admire you, but I must have been blind!”

Ke Tian felt awkward and angry, snapping, “What do you know? Get out of the way.”

As he spoke, he joined forces with Luo Jin. The Jade Scepter in Luo Jin’s hand was truly mysterious—he tapped it lightly through the air toward Yang Kai, and Yang Kai felt as if a great mountain was crashing down on him, the force so fierce it threatened to crush the void.

He dared not take it head-on and could only dodge. At that moment, Ke Tian made his move, forming a seal with his hand. The Thunder Order released a torrent of lightning, turning into electric serpents that wrapped around Yang Kai, crackling loudly.

“Banish!” At the critical moment, Yang Kai shouted, grabbing forward with one hand. Instantly, a black hole appeared in the void, filled with nothingness and chaos. All the lightning from the Thunder Order was swallowed up, not harming Yang Kai in the slightest.

“What!” Ke Tian was shocked. Sensing the Thunder Order’s power weakening, he quickly withdrew the Secret Treasure, not daring to release more lightning. The thunder within was collected on stormy days—once used, it was gone, and had to be replenished. Losing so much at once meant the Thunder Order’s power was greatly reduced, which pained him deeply.

This exchange happened in the blink of an eye, thunderous and earth-shaking, making the entire hall tremble as if it might collapse at any moment.

The surrounding martial artists scattered in terror, all of them panic-stricken.

Ke Tian missed, but Luo Jin’s Jade Scepter tapped the void several more times.

Waves of invisible force struck at Yang Kai. Suspended in midair, his eyes narrowed, and a chill rose in his heart. In a split second, several Moon Blades slashed out.

The pitch-black Moon Blades carried unstoppable force. Their sudden appearance startled Luo Jin, but in the next instant, with a series of bangs, they collided with the invisible attacks from the Jade Scepter, canceling each other out.

“Thunder Sound Formless, Thunder Sound Shapeless!” Ke Tian shouted, arcs of lightning swirling around him like a dance of demons, forming a lightning rope that shot toward Yang Kai, trying to bind him in place.

Yang Kai dodged, but at that crucial moment, Luo Jin gave a sinister smile and struck with the Jade Scepter again.

Suddenly, Yang Kai felt as if a mountain was pressing down on him, making it nearly impossible to straighten his back.

In that instant, the lightning rope wrapped tightly around him, crackling loudly, and the smell of roasting meat filled the air.

Luo Jin laughed, “The young don’t know how high the heavens are or how deep the earth is. You have to suffer a little to see your own strength clearly.”

He looked as if victory was already his, wild with arrogance.

Ke Tian also wiped sweat from his brow, secretly shocked by Yang Kai’s strength.

After all, both he and Luo Jin were a Stage higher than Yang Kai. Though they subdued him in just over a dozen breaths by joining forces, it was still astonishing.

An ordinary Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm couldn’t last three moves against them.
