## Chapter 266 — Complete Annihilation

In a flurry, she was captured and then thrown back, leaving the girl no time to react as she fell straight toward the ground.

The group of pursuers behind her saw this scene and their spirits lifted. They scattered in all directions, and by the time the girl landed, she was completely surrounded.

"Little brat! Let's see where you can run now!" The leading man bellowed with gritted teeth, his face filled with killing intent.

The others sneered coldly, some even sizing up the girl’s delicate and voluptuous figure, their eyes flashing with hidden lust.

Yang Kai observed their expressions, and his face darkened suddenly.

These people… are not good!

The girl’s expression was filled with indignation as she bit her red lip, glancing warily at the surrounding men, not daring to move. Her strength was not particularly strong, only at the peak of the Separation and Union Realm, and now surrounded, there was no way for her to escape.

She glanced at Yang Kai, her big eyes filled with rage as she shouted, "You bastard, you shameless scoundrel! I curse you to die a miserable death, your soul destroyed, struck by heavenly lightning…"

If it weren't for being thrown back by Yang Kai, she would have already dashed into the Yao Wang Valley and been safe. Thinking of this, the girl felt both wronged and furious.

Yang Kai snorted lightly and turned to leave!

Although he knew this group of men were not good, the girl’s earlier actions also angered him, and he had made up his mind to scare her a little.

Seeing him so heartless, the girl felt a chill run through her.

As Yang Kai intended to leave, the two men surrounding the girl exchanged glances, and immediately, two of them stealthily darted out, wielding sharp swords and steel blades as they approached Yang Kai.

Regardless of whether these two were cousins, since he had caught them in the act, there was no reason to leave any survivors.

Just as the girl was about to warn him, a sharp sword was already pressed against her neck, the cold sensation causing her to swallow back her words.

The two men were both at the peak of the Separation and Union Realm, their strength comparable to the girl’s. Their speed was like the wind, quickly arriving behind Yang Kai, their weapons gleaming with a chilling light as they struck toward his vital points.

The girl couldn’t help but exclaim, her big eyes narrowing, her long eyelashes trembling. At this moment, she couldn’t help but feel a pang of regret.

She really shouldn’t have dragged this unfamiliar man into her troubles. She had been chased too urgently earlier, and in a moment of inspiration, she had shouted, not expecting to involve him in such a calamity.

As Yang Kai walked forward, it was as if he had eyes in the back of his head. Just before the weapons struck, he suddenly floated forward, miraculously evading the two men’s attacks.

Turning around, Yang Kai looked at the two with indifference, a slow smile creeping onto his lips.

This sudden change startled the two men, causing them to break into a cold sweat. They realized this youth was not weak, and with a loud shout, they activated their Yuan Qi, launching their killing moves at Yang Kai.

In mid-air, two shadows of fists erupted. Before the two men could react, their bodies were violently sent flying backward by a tremendous force.

In mid-air, they coughed up blood continuously, and by the time they hit the ground, they had already lost their lives.

“Jie jie jie jie…” The Earth Demon cackled and struck from the other realm. It hadn’t played much of a role until now, but having finally emerged, it naturally wanted to showcase its skills.

Black aura burst forth, swirling around the two corpses before shooting out into the distance.

The leading man, seeing his two subordinates die in an instant, changed color dramatically. He pressed the long sword against the girl’s neck and coldly shouted, “Charge!”

The remaining men couldn’t help but swallow hard, all roaring in anger as they fiercely charged toward Yang Kai.

“Jie jie…” The Earth Demon attacked again, causing several of them to jump in fright. One of them split off to engage the Earth Demon’s Soul-Breaking Spike, while the others continued to rush at Yang Kai.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three dull sounds echoed as the large man who had rushed to Yang Kai’s side was involuntarily sent flying, each of them having their chests caved in as if struck by a heavy blow.

In the year since entering this other realm, Yang Kai had fought against elite disciples from various factions, each of whom had the ability to fight above their level, capable of killing enemies two or three stages higher.

Yet, these elites had still suffered at Yang Kai’s hands, even the strongest among them, Wu Chengyi, could not escape death.

Now, facing these small fry, how could they possibly be Yang Kai’s opponents?

With a single move, they had no chance to resist; those weaker were directly killed, while those slightly stronger fell to the ground, completely incapacitated.

As the three bodies fell to the ground, the Earth Demon shamelessly abandoned its opponent and went to seize the souls of others.

The opponent of the Earth Demon hadn’t even had a chance to escape before Yang Kai grabbed him back, locking his hands around the man’s head and twisting fiercely.

With a crack, the man’s neck snapped, and his body fell limp.

Dropping the corpse, Yang Kai walked coldly toward the man who had kidnapped the girl, his True Essence radiating outward, his clothes billowing without wind, resembling a fearsome god of death.

The girl’s mouth formed a round shape as she looked at Yang Kai in astonishment, seemingly not expecting this young man she had dragged into trouble to be so powerful!

He didn’t look much older than her, how could he be so strong?

In her sparkling eyes, a deep layer of fear and shock began to form. Compared to the group that had pursued her for days, Yang Kai seemed more like a ruthless villain, a blood-soaked butcher.

Killing people was as easy for him as crushing an ant, and throughout the ordeal, his cold expression never changed, not even blinking once.

To him, human life was as light as a feather, not worth a moment’s thought.

The girl trembled in fear, and the man who had kidnapped her felt the same way.

Although he had the strength of the Fourth Stage of the True Essence Realm, he was now terrified, his soul shaken. He knew his subordinates' strengths all too well; he could handle them one-on-one, but it was impossible to be as effortless and relaxed as this youth.

“My friend, it’s all a misunderstanding!” The leading man’s forehead broke into a cold sweat as he looked warily at the advancing Yang Kai, forcing a smile, “We haven’t done anything to you; let’s just call it a day, shall we?”

Yang Kai remained indifferent, saying nothing.

“Indeed, it was our fault for not recognizing you, but you’ve already killed so many; do you really want to wipe us all out?” The man retreated repeatedly, the long sword still pressed against the girl’s neck.

Seeing Yang Kai remain unmoved, the man knew that there would be no mercy today. He steeled his heart, his expression turning fierce as he gritted his teeth and growled, “Don’t come any closer! If you do, I’ll kill her with one sword!”

“Go ahead! If you kill her, you’ll die too!” Yang Kai continued to approach the man leisurely.

The man broke into a cold sweat, feeling as if a great mountain was pressing down on him, making it hard to breathe. His True Essence involuntarily surged, and he tightened his grip on the long sword, causing the girl to let out a startled cry as she felt a chill at her neck, a warm trickle flowing from there.

“Do you really think I won’t kill?” The man threatened, his voice trembling.

Before he could finish speaking, Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, and an invisible force surged from his mind, rushing toward the man’s soul.

This was the power of Divine Sense!

Divine Sense could not only be used to perceive the surroundings but also for attack. However, Yang Kai had never had such experience before; he was merely taking a gamble.

As the Divine Sense entered, the man’s expression froze for a moment. When he regained his senses, he saw the youth had already closed in on him, reaching out to grab his long sword.

The man roared in anger, activating his True Essence as he viciously swung toward the girl’s neck, intending to take them both down.

Yang Kai was quick to react, striking toward the man’s face while simultaneously sweeping his foot toward the girl, pushing her out of the sword’s path.

In the blink of an eye, the girl darted to the side, a few strands of her hair severed and flying in the air. The man hurriedly retreated, dodging Yang Kai’s palm, but his long sword grazed Yang Kai’s other hand, leaving a long gash.

Blood splattered as Yang Kai’s expression remained cold and steady. Seizing the opportunity, he closed in, clenching his blood-soaked fist and delivering a punch to the man’s chest.

Triple Flame Yang Explosion!

The man, despite having the strength of the Fourth Stage of the True Essence Realm, was caught off guard by Yang Kai’s strike, and though he wasn’t completely powerless, he was forced to defend himself against a barrage of attacks.

In the midst of the battle, the three strands of True Essence from the Triple Flame Yang Explosion erupted within him, causing the man to grunt three times, his face turning pale.

Only at this moment did the Earth Demon find the opportunity to pounce, joining forces with Yang Kai to fight.

After a dozen exchanges, Yang Kai pierced through the man’s chest with a single finger.

His eyes gradually lost their luster, and the man’s face was filled with bitterness as he murmured, “Madman…”

The Earth Demon cackled, wrapping the Soul-Breaking Spike and plunging it into his body, seizing the man’s soul, which then transformed into black aura and merged into Yang Kai’s body.

“Master, do you feel it?” The Earth Demon asked softly.

“En!” Yang Kai shook the blood from his hands, “These people’s Yuan Qi is very violent; it seems they are practitioners of evil techniques or martial artists who have fallen into the path of evil.”

When martial artists reach the Separation and Union Realm, their hearts can split into two extremes, which is why this realm is called Separation and Union.

Enjoying the thrill of power, unable to suppress their emotional outbursts, and being swayed by various emotions—that is what is known as an evil practitioner! Many martial artists are like this; the higher their strength, the more pronounced their behavior becomes, ultimately leading them down a different path from others. The people Yang Kai had just killed were such examples.

Compared to normal cultivation methods, which way is better to cultivate, no one can say for sure. But generally speaking, evil practitioners are not well-received.

And in the world, the largest gathering place for evil practitioners is the Cangyun Evil Land!

In that area of several thousand miles, all kinds of demons gather, and evil martial artists are everywhere.

The order given to Yang Kai by the Grand Elder Wei Xitong of the Lingxiao Pavilion was to go to the Cangyun Evil Land and slay an evil practitioner whose strength was not lower than his own, but Yang Kai had refused.

But… how did this girl end up attracting these people?
