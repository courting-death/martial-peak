## Chapter 266 — Extermination

In a flurry, she was captured and then thrown back, the girl barely had time to react before she fell straight towards the ground.

The group of pursuers behind her saw this scene and their spirits lifted. They scattered in all directions, and by the time the girl landed, they had already surrounded her completely.

“Little vixen! Let’s see where you can run now!” The leading Great Han gritted his teeth and shouted, his face filled with killing intent.

The others sneered coldly, with several of them sizing up the girl’s delicate and voluptuous figure, a hint of hidden lust flashing in their eyes.

Yang Kai observed their expressions and his face suddenly turned cold.

This group of people… were not good!

The girl’s expression was filled with indignation as she bit her red lips, glancing warily at the surrounding Great Han, not daring to move. Her strength was not particularly strong, only at the peak of the Separation and Union Realm, and now surrounded, there was no way for her to escape.

She looked towards Yang Kai with wide eyes and shouted sharply, “You bastard, you shameless one! I curse you to die a horrible death, your soul obliterated, struck by heavenly lightning…”

If it weren’t for Yang Kai throwing her back, she would have already rushed into the Yao Wang Valley and been safe. Thinking of this, the girl felt both wronged and furious.

Yang Kai snorted lightly and turned to leave!

Although he knew this group of Great Han were not good, the girl’s earlier actions also made him slightly angry, and he decided to scare her a bit.

Seeing him so heartless, the girl felt a chill run through her body.

As Yang Kai attempted to leave, two of the Great Han surrounding the girl exchanged glances, and silently darted out. Armed with sharp swords and steel blades, they approached Yang Kai.

Regardless of whether these two were cousins or not, having been seen by him, there was no reason to leave any witnesses.

Just as the girl was about to remind him, a sharp sword was already pressed against her neck, the cold sensation causing her to swallow her words.

The two Great Han were both at the peak of the Separation and Union Realm, their strength comparable to the girl’s. Their speed was like the wind, and they quickly arrived behind Yang Kai, their weapons gleaming coldly as they struck towards his vital points.

The girl couldn’t help but exclaim, her large eyes narrowing, her long eyelashes trembling. At that moment, she couldn’t help but feel a bit regretful.

She really shouldn’t have dragged this unfamiliar man into her troubles; she had been chased too urgently earlier, and in a moment of panic, she shouted without thinking, not expecting to involve him in such a disaster.

Yang Kai, who was walking forward, seemed to have eyes on his back. Just before the weapons reached him, he suddenly floated forward, miraculously dodging the two’s attacks.

Turning around, Yang Kai looked at the two with indifference, a slow smile creeping onto his lips. 

This sudden change startled the two Great Han, cold sweat breaking out on their foreheads. They realized this youth was not weak, and with a loud shout, they urged their Primordial Qi and unleashed their killing moves towards Yang Kai.

In mid-air, two shadows of fists erupted. Before the two Great Han could react, their bodies were knocked back by a tremendous force.

In the air, they both spat blood continuously, and by the time they landed, they had already met their demise.

“Jie jie jie jie…” The Earth Demon cackled as it struck from the shadows. It hadn’t played much of a role until now, and having finally emerged, it naturally wanted to show off its skills.

Black aura burst forth, swirling around the two corpses before flying away.

The leading Great Han, seeing his two subordinates die instantly, changed color dramatically. He pressed his long sword against the girl’s neck and coldly shouted, “Charge!”

The remaining people couldn’t help but swallow hard, roaring in unison as they fiercely charged towards Yang Kai.

“Jie jie…” The Earth Demon attacked again, causing several people to jump in fright at this strange treasure. One of them immediately engaged with the Earth Demon’s Soul-Breaking Spike, while the others continued their assault on Yang Kai.

Bang bang bang…

Three muffled sounds echoed as the large Great Han who had rushed to Yang Kai’s side was sent flying involuntarily, each of their chests caving in as if struck by a heavy blow.

Since entering this strange land over the past year, Yang Kai had faced the elite disciples of various factions. Each of these elite disciples had the ability to fight above their level, capable of slaying enemies two or three realms higher.

Yet, these elites had still suffered at Yang Kai’s hands, even the strongest Wu Chengyi had not escaped death.

Now, facing these small fry, how could they possibly be Yang Kai’s opponents?

With a single move, they had no chance to resist; those with lower strength died instantly, while those slightly stronger were left incapacitated, completely losing their ability to fight.

As the three bodies fell to the ground, the Earth Demon shamelessly abandoned its opponent and directly went to devour the souls of others.

The Earth Demon’s opponent hadn’t even had time to escape before Yang Kai grabbed him back, locking his hands around the man’s head and twisting fiercely.

With a crisp crack, the man’s neck snapped, his body collapsing limply to the ground.

Leaving the corpse behind, Yang Kai walked coldly towards the Great Han who had taken the girl hostage, his True Essence radiating outward, his clothes billowing without wind, resembling a fearsome killing god.

The girl’s mouth formed an “O” shape as she stared in astonishment at Yang Kai, seemingly not expecting this young man she had dragged into trouble to be so powerful!

He looked to be only slightly older than her, how could he be so formidable?

In her wide, blinking eyes, a deep layer of fear and shock began to form. Compared to this group of enemies who had pursued her for days, Yang Kai seemed more like a ruthless villain, a blood-soaked butcher.

Killing was as easy for him as crushing an ant, his cold expression unchanged throughout, not even blinking once.

To him, human life was as light as a feather, not worth a moment’s consideration.

The girl trembled in fear, and the Great Han who had taken her hostage felt the same.

Though he possessed the strength of the Fourth Stage of the True Essence Realm, he was now utterly terrified, his spirit shaken. He knew his subordinates’ strengths all too well; he could handle them one-on-one, but there was no way he could do so with this youth so easily and effortlessly.

“My friend, this is all a misunderstanding!” The leading Great Han’s forehead broke out in cold sweat as he looked warily at the advancing Yang Kai, forcing a smile, “We haven’t done anything to you, can we just let this go?”

Yang Kai’s expression remained indifferent, not uttering a word.

“It is indeed our fault for being blind, but you’ve already killed so many, do you really want to exterminate us all?” The Great Han continued to retreat, the long sword still pressed against the girl’s neck.

Seeing Yang Kai remain unmoved, the Great Han knew that there was no way to resolve this peacefully today. He steeled his heart, his expression turning sinister as he gritted his teeth and growled, “Don’t come any closer! If you do, I’ll kill her with one sword!”

“Go ahead! If you kill her, you’ll die too!” Yang Kai continued to approach the Great Han leisurely.

The Great Han was drenched in sweat, feeling as if a mountain was pressing down on him as Yang Kai drew near, making it hard for him to breathe. His True Essence involuntarily began to circulate, and he tightened his grip on the long sword, causing the girl to gasp in surprise as she felt a chill at her neck, warm blood trickling down.

“Do you really think I won’t kill?” The Great Han threatened, his voice trembling.

Before he could finish, Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, an invisible force surged from his mind, directly assaulting the Great Han’s spirit.

This was the power of Divine Sense!

Divine Sense could not only be used to perceive the surroundings but also for attack. However, Yang Kai had never had such experience before, and was merely taking a risk to try.

As his Divine Sense invaded, the Great Han’s expression momentarily froze. By the time he came to his senses, he saw the youth had already closed the distance, reaching out to grab his long sword.

The Great Han roared in anger, urging his True Essence as he viciously swung towards the girl’s neck, intending to take them both down together.

Yang Kai was quick to react, striking towards the Great Han’s face while simultaneously kicking the girl out of the way from the sword’s edge.

In the blink of an eye, the girl darted to the side, several strands of her hair severed and flying in the air. The Great Han hurriedly retreated, dodging Yang Kai’s palm, but his long sword grazed Yang Kai’s other hand, leaving a long wound.

Blood splattered, and Yang Kai’s expression remained cold and steady as he pressed forward, clenching his bloodied fist and delivering a punch to the Great Han’s chest.

Triple Flame Yang Explosion!

The Great Han, despite having the strength of the Fourth Stage of the True Essence Realm, was caught off guard by Yang Kai’s strike, and although he wasn’t completely defenseless, he was unable to withstand the onslaught as his long sword danced defensively, unleashing a flurry of killing moves.

In the midst of the struggle, the three strands of True Essence from the Triple Flame Yang Explosion erupted within him, causing the Great Han to grunt three times, his face suddenly paling.

Only then did the Earth Demon find the opportunity to pounce, joining forces with Yang Kai.

After several exchanges, Yang Kai pierced through the Great Han’s chest with a single finger.

His eyes gradually lost their luster, and the Great Han’s face was filled with bitterness as he murmured, “Madman…”

The Earth Demon cackled, driving the Soul-Breaking Spike into his body, devouring the man’s soul, which then transformed into black aura and merged into Yang Kai’s body.

“Master, do you feel it?” the Earth Demon asked softly.

“Hmm!” Yang Kai shook the blood off his hands, “The Primordial Qi of these people is quite violent; it seems they are practitioners of evil techniques or martial artists who have fallen into the path of evil.”

When martial artists reach the Separation and Union Realm, their temperament can split into two extremes, which is why this realm is called Separation and Union.

Enjoying the thrill of power, unable to suppress their emotional outbursts, and being swayed by various emotions—that is what is known as an evil practitioner! Such individuals are generally quite ruthless and bloodthirsty.

Many martial artists end up like this; the higher their strength, the more pronounced their behavior, ultimately leading them down a different cultivation path. The people Yang Kai just killed were prime examples.

Compared to normal cultivation methods, it’s unclear which way is better, but overall, evil practitioners are not well-received.

And in the world, the largest gathering place for evil practitioners is the Cangyun Evil Land!

In that area spanning thousands of miles, various demons gather, and evil martial artists are everywhere.

Initially, the Grand Elder Wei Xitong of the Lingxiao Pavilion had issued a promotion order to Yang Kai, instructing him to go to the Cangyun Evil Land to slay an evil practitioner of strength not lower than his own, but Yang Kai had refused.

But… how did this girl attract these people? (To be continued)
