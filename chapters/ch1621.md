## Chapter 1621 — Imperial Treasure's Might

"So it's Senior Luo Hai!" Yang Kai feigned belated realization, his gaze shifting to Senior Luo Hai as he frowned and asked, "What do you mean by this, Senior?"

A faint smile flickered across Luo Hai's face; he did not answer but instead countered, "You two rush off like that—where are you headed?"

"Naturally, we're leaving this place to return to Dark Star. Do you have business here, Senior?"

"No matter," Luo Hai shook his head slowly. "But Elder Jiu and Senior Sister Lei and the others are all waiting to have a good talk with this friend. You two leaving without so much as a word—surely that's not very proper?"

"It is somewhat improper," Yang Kai bowed his head slightly. "But this arose suddenly; we must hurry back to Dark Star. Since we've met you here, please do us the favor of conveying our apologies; we won't come to bid farewell in person."

"That won't do!" Luo Hai showed no sign of compromise. "They've been waiting many days—both of you will come with me."

"Lord Luo Hai, that hardly seems reasonable," Qian Tong drew a deep breath. "Whether we go or not is mine and Yang Kai's freedom—are you trying to force us?"

He had already learned from Yang Kai that Luo Hai harbored no good intentions toward him, so his tone was less than polite. Having just broken into the Void King Realm, he was flush with pride; even facing Luo Hai he felt little fear.

Electricity flashed in Luo Hai's eyes as he cast a cold glance at Qian Tong.

Qian Tong was instantly struck as if by lightning; his body trembled, his face paling, horror flashing across his eyes as he immediately sensed the vast gulf between himself and Luo Hai.

After giving Qian Tong a small lesson, Luo Hai turned to Yang Kai with a pleasant smile. "Think it over carefully and reply to me. Hmm, I'll give you ten breaths' time."

His tone was unquestionably rigid.

Yang Kai's expression hardened—he had not expected such a powerful figure to be capable of such shamelessness.

Qian Tong and Yang Kai exchanged glances, both feeling the gravity of the situation and helplessness; on Cuiwei Star, even a Third Stage of the Void King Realm might find it difficult to deal with Luo Hai—let alone the two of them together.

Ten breaths passed in the blink of an eye; Luo Hai asked coolly, "Have you decided?"

As he spoke, that patch of heaven seemed to grow solid and compact, rendering motion impossible.

Qian Tong looked to Yang Kai—clearly everything hinged on him.

Yang Kai drew a deep breath and said in a low voice, "We've decided."

"Oh? And what is your answer?"

"We'll come..."

A satisfied smile touched Luo Hai's lips.

"...never!" Yang Kai shouted.

His shout had barely died when a faint Domain field spread from Qian Tong's body. It wrapped him, allowing him to contend with the star force of Cuiwei Star. He bit his tongue, spitting a stream of blood from his mouth.

Within that blood lay Qian Tong's natal essence, which immediately congealed into a blood-arrow that shot toward Luo Hai with blinding speed.

"How dare you!" Luo Hai roared in fury—no one had ever dared attack him, the Star Lord of Cuiwei Star, on his own world; Yang Kai and Qian Tong were the first.

Luo Hai's gaze grew sinister as he stared at Qian Tong. With a casual wave of his hand, the blood-arrow that rushed toward him shattered with a crash. At the same time, Qian Tong was struck as if by a tremendous blow—his chest caved inward, and he spewed a jet of blood.

His face drained of color in an instant.

"You're courting death!" Luo Hai's eyes turned ice-cold; he had no intention of letting Qian Tong off.

Since things had already fallen apart, he naturally had no intention of holding back. Besides, they were nearly at the edge of the star's domain — about to leave Cuiwei Star’s domain laws — where no one would be able to sense the battle taking place here.

His primary target remained Yang Kai; as for Qian Tong, he was of little consequence.

He reached out and pointed from afar; a burst of pure white light flashed from his fingertip, dazzlingly bright as though something were about to fire out, aimed straight at Qian Tong.

Crackling...

Just then, a burst of lightning and thunder erupted, rumbling through the air. A presence that made Luo Hai’s face change drastically suddenly descended from above his head.

Luo Hai's expression changed; he lifted his head and his eyelids contracted.

Over his head, at some unknown time, a mass of ink-black clouds had appeared, within which countless thin lightning arcs darted and weaved.

Though the arcs were small, they contained a terrifying force capable of destroying heaven and earth.

Even Luo Hai felt deeply shaken.

He snapped awake and turned to look at Yang Kai, discovering the young man holding a deep-blue bead in his hand, Saint Yuan being frantically poured into it—the bead's surface flickered with lightning arcs that echoed the ones above Luo Hai's head.

Was this brat the one interfering? And what was that bead?

Luo Hai's thoughts raced, but before he could discern the orb's mysteries, the countless fine lightning arcs above him shot straight down, enclosing the stretch of heaven where he stood.

A hissing roar filled the air!

Luo Hai's furious roar split the clouds and resounded to the Star Domain.

When the Star Lord raged, Cuiwei Star trembled.

At that moment the entire Cuiwei Star seemed on the verge of shattering—earthquakes, mountain collapses and tidal upheavals—an omen of impending apocalypse.

Tens of millions of residents on Cuiwei Star were struck dumb with fear.

Elder Jiu and the others straightened in alarm, their faces registering horror.

"It's Lord Luo Hai!" Matron Lei's ancient features registered panic.

"Who could have provoked him so?"

"Who is capable of making him so furious?"

All eyes turned skyward; their gazes, penetrating past palaces and cloud barriers, seemed to sense something.

"Imperial Might!" Li Wanning cried out, her lovely face gone white.

The others shook in their boots.

They were indeed Void Kings, standing atop the clouds, gazing down upon all living beings — yet before a being of legend, an Emperor, they were nothing but ants! The instant they felt that overwhelming Imperial Might, everyone was utterly shaken.

Yet why would Imperial Might be sensed within the starry sky of Cuiwei Star? And why did that Imperial Might carry such murderous intent?

What had Luo Hai encountered?

People exchanged uneasy looks, some wanting to peer closer but fearful to do so. Beyond the heavy murderous intention of the Imperial Might, if they stumbled upon some secret of Luo Hai's, they would be in grave trouble.

So they stood there with stern faces, waiting quietly and sensing in silence.

Within the starry sky for ten thousand li around, lightning flashed and thunder rolled; countless thin lightning arcs darted through that space.

This place had become a world of lightning!

Luo Hai’s face darkened to an extreme. Fixing his gaze on a single direction, he ground his teeth and hissed low, “Imperial Treasure! So it truly is the Imperial Treasure! Boy, you forced my hand—I’ll make sure you die, one way or another!”

He had never expected Yang Kai to possess such a heaven-defying thing as an Imperial Treasure.

Only an Imperial Treasure could rend the seals he had laid and break through that layer of restriction to allow Yang Kai and Qian Tong to leave safely.

He had heard the name of the Imperial Treasure before.

It was a Secret Treasure once wielded by a Great Emperor, imbued with the Emperor’s aura—hence it was worthy of being called an Imperial Treasure.

Yet throughout the Star Domain, though the Imperial Treasure's renown was vast, no one had seen it with their own eyes—no one knew its true form or what terrifying power it possessed.

Luo Hai had just experienced it himself.

Were it not for Yang Kai's insufficient cultivation and for the fact they were still within the range of Cuiwei Star's star force, that single strike would likely have wounded him.

The Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm being able to injure the Second Stage of the Void King Realm was nearly inconceivable—but that brat Yang Kai had nearly achieved it.

Thoughts flashed in Luo Hai's mind and his eyes brightened. He murmured, "The Extinction Thunder Bead—this must be the legendary Extinction Thunder Bead!"

Every treasure used by the Great Emperor carried a famous reputation; some were widely known while ordinary people could not be aware. As a Star Lord at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, Luo Hai had naturally heard of the Extinction Thunder Bead.

Having personally felt the Imperial Treasure's might, Luo Hai immediately concluded that it was indeed the Extinction Thunder Bead!

Luo Hai grinned, his expression vicious.

If he could obtain the Extinction Thunder Bead, he could unleash a large portion of the Imperial Treasure's power; then, even facing a Third Stage of the Void King Realm, he would be confident of victory.

Luo Hai vowed that he would become the foremost of the Star Domain!

The lightning arcs gradually weakened and then vanished.

The starry sky regained its calm.

"You think you can run?" Luo Hai flicked his great sleeve, hands clasped behind his back as he strolled forward; in the next instant he was a hundred li away, giving chase to Yang Kai.

Setting aside whether the Void Mind Crystal was truly in Yang Kai's hands, the Extinction Thunder Bead—an Imperial Treasure—was enough to inflame his greed; he could not allow Yang Kai to slip from him this time.

He wanted the Extinction Thunder Bead, and the Void Mind Crystal as well!

What puzzled him was that he could only sense Yang Kai's aura from afar—Qian Tong seemed to have vanished without a trace.

Not only that, but the others who had been with Yang Kai likewise seemed to have disappeared for no discernible reason; even Luo Hai did not know where they had gone.

Ten thousand li away from Luo Hai, Yang Kai frantically stirred his Saint Yuan, fleeing while adjusting his breath, his face as grave as can be.

Although the blow delivered with the Extinction Thunder Bead had taken Luo Hai by surprise, breaking his blockade and allowing them to flee Cuiwei Star, Luo Hai remained a genuine Second Stage of the Void King Realm even without the star force's assistance.

Escaping with their lives from his grasp would be no easy task!

Moreover, that strike with the Extinction Thunder Bead had drained almost all of Yang Kai's Saint Yuan; he had been forced to burst forth a drop of pure Golden Blood just to buy himself a moment to breathe.

The more Saint Yuan poured into the Extinction Thunder Bead, the greater the power it could unleash; even if a Third Stage of the Void King Realm used it, it could never tap its full might.

Yang Kai estimated that his effort had likely invoked no more than a tenth of the bead's power.

A stabbing pain shot through his head; the Sea of Consciousness churned, its waters drying, and faint cracks appeared in its space—signs of Divine Sense overexertion.

Such injuries were serious; under normal circumstances Yang Kai would not worry—he could rest and let the Warm Spirit Lotus mend the Sea of Consciousness back to its former state.

But now, where could he find the time to recuperate?

He stuffed pill after pill into his mouth, desperate to restore a measure of Divine Sense power in the shortest time possible—only then would he have a chance to escape.
