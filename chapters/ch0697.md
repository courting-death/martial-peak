## Chapter 697 — Sure Enough, No Luck

The Tianxiao Sect and Elder Du treated Yang Kai quite well, but if they learned he had ties to the Ancient Demon Clan, they would probably urge him to devise a plan to exterminate the Ancient Demon Clan!

Yang Kai did not want to see such a scene.

During his time at Mo Shen Fort he had been cared for by Li Rong and Han Fei and others, and he had come to think the Ancient Demon Clan were not bad people.

After a while of idle chatter, everyone began to rest.

Night had fallen and the wilderness was quiet, with only a faint campfire flickering.

Mi Na quietly tugged at Yang Kai’s clothes. Yang Kai opened his eyes and looked at her with suspicion.

“Come with me.” Mi Na said softly, crouching and heading into the darkness.

Yang Kai rose and followed at an easy pace.

After walking out several hundred zhang they arrived beneath a large tree. Mi Na sat down, leaning against the trunk, patting the spot beside her to indicate Yang Kai should sit as well.

“What’s the matter?” Yang Kai asked in surprise.

“Nothing much, just want to chat — talking over there would disturb the others.” Mi Na smiled charmingly.

“What do you want to talk about?” Yang Kai idly plucked a blade of grass and twirled it on his fingertip.

“Anything.” Mi Na stretched her legs out and let out a lazy yawn, visibly relaxing, then turned to ask, “Who taught you all this alchemy? You’re younger than me yet already a Spirit-Grade Upper-Level alchemist — how did that happen?”

“If I told you I taught myself, would you believe me?” Yang Kai smiled.

Mi Na snorted, obviously not believing him.

“Then there’s nothing I can do.” Yang Kai shrugged.

“Elder Du said there must be a top-tier alchemist guiding you behind the scenes, someone far stronger than him in alchemical skill.”

“You could say that.” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

His alchemical True Formula was something left behind by the Great Demon God; his alchemical skill could be said to be self-taught, and could also be said to come from the Great Demon God’s legacy.

“So such a person really exists. Elder Du would love to meet him.” Mi Na’s expression shifted at the words. “But Elder Du also knows someone like that won’t reveal themselves lightly, nor will they see outsiders easily.”

“Heh…” Yang Kai gave a dry laugh. He could understand Elder Du’s desire to meet that hypothetical master — perhaps his alchemy had reached a bottleneck and he wanted to glean some experience from another to see if he could break through in his lifetime.

One of the purposes for going to Fuyun City this time was probably that as well; after all, many top-tier alchemists would gather there.

“If there’s a chance, could you introduce Elder Du to him?” Mi Na asked Yang Kai hopefully.

Yang Kai fell silent and did not speak for a long time.

He could not agree to that request.

“Why are you quiet?” Mi Na noticed his silence and suddenly felt her request might have been presumptuous; she was at a loss.

“The one who taught me alchemy is dead.”

“Ah…” Mi Na covered her little mouth and hurriedly apologized, “I’m sorry, I didn’t know.”

“It’s all right…” Yang Kai shook his head.

At that moment both their faces changed. Focusing their minds on the distance ahead, they saw a fierce Divine Sense energy rapidly approaching; in the blink of an eye it descended over Yang Kai and Mi Na.

Mi Na tensed as if facing a mortal enemy and hurriedly brought forth various Secret Treasures to guard her body.

Although she had little combat experience, her reflexes were quick; in her fluster she nevertheless sealed her defenses tightly.

Yang Kai glanced at her oddly, his expression indifferent. His gaze gradually turned cold as he stared into the void.

He felt this Divine Sense power was strange, not like the usual Divine Sense attacks he had encountered.

While he thought this, the Divine Sense energy actually circled Yang Kai and Mi Na several times, then in the next moment dove into Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness and vanished.

“Yang Kai!” Mi Na’s face went white and she called out in alarm.

Yang Kai sat motionless, his eyes vacant.

Swish, swish, swish…

The commotion attracted the others from a few hundred zhang away. Cang Yan arrived at once and asked in a deep voice, “What happened?”

He had sensed a burst of Divine Sense a moment ago and, hearing Mi Na’s cry, rushed over, but had found nothing.

Panicked, Mi Na quickly recounted what had just occurred.

“Attempted possession?” Li Wan’s face changed; he keenly sensed the truth.

A strong cultivator must have died nearby, their soul fled the body and happened to encounter Yang Kai, then tried to seize Yang Kai’s body for themselves.

“Possession, huh…” Fei Yu pursed her lips and gave a coquettish laugh, “Then we have nothing to worry about.”

Cang Yan also noticeably relaxed and nodded.

Li Wan and Fei Jian even grinned sleazily.

“Y—You’re not worried at all?” Mi Na nearly wept. She knew what possession meant and the consequences — if it went badly, Yang Kai’s soul could be completely obliterated.

The four great talents from the Tianxiao Sect not only showed no concern but even displayed looks of schadenfreude, which Mi Na could not understand.

Elder Du smiled slightly and said, “Mi Na! Calm down.”

“Elder Du, they…” Mi Na stamped her foot.

“Young friend Yang will not be possessed; have you forgotten what he has?” Elder Du looked at Mi Na with meaningful eyes.

Mi Na thought for a moment and her face brightened: “Oh right, that bastard has Divine Sense…”

Elder Du nodded slightly. “As long as the incoming soul is not from a Saint Realm cultivator, Yang can handle it easily. Let us wait and see.”

“This fellow’s unlucky — of all people to pick, he chose my little nephew; if it were me, I’d pick you, soft-skinned little miss.” Li Wan grinned lecherously.

Mi Na glared at him fiercely. “Ungrateful old man!”

“Hey, I am still young, you know.” Li Wan immediately objected.

Inside the Sea of Consciousness Yang Kai’s mouth curled into an inexplicable smile as he eyed the invading soul, which had become clumsy after bursting in.

The invader had intended to devour Yang Kai’s soul and seize his body, but once it entered this searing Sea of Consciousness it realized something was wrong.

It felt as if it had stepped into the gates of hell.

The surrounding burning sea and the scorching aura made it howl in pain; its soul could not withstand such burning. The torment upon its spirit was unbearable.

“If you don’t want to die, show your Spirit Body.” Yang Kai said indifferently.

The soul trembled and soon a clear corporeal likeness appeared before Yang Kai, face contorted in pain, teeth clenched, looking at Yang Kai with fear and dread.

The man looked only fifty or sixty, yet his soul had the strength of a Second Stage Transcendent, which meant he had been quite a formidable expert in life.

“You’re truly unlucky.” Yang Kai shook his head, full of scorn.

Sensing Yang Kai’s hostility, the man forced a pained smile and said, “Young brother, this is a misunderstanding; things are not as you think.”

“Oh really?” Yang Kai grinned. Within the Sea of Consciousness the fire swelled and grew ever hotter.

“Allow me to explain.” The man screamed hoarsely.

Yang Kai paid him no mind; since the man intended to possess his body, Yang Kai would not be polite.

Turmoil rose within the Sea of Consciousness; the scorching Divine Sense fire pressed upon the man’s soul, attempting to burn it away in one stroke.

“Wait, spare me and I will tell you a secret.”

“I’m not very interested.” Yang Kai shook his head, his face utterly cold.

“It concerns your lives!” the man bellowed.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. The turbulence in his Sea of Consciousness eased and he gazed at the man intently for a long moment before saying, “If you are only buying time or lying to me, I will not kill you — I will make your life worse than death.”

“No, no, I wouldn’t — ” The man relaxed slightly when Yang Kai did not immediately strike him down and hurried on, “You’re headed to Fuyun City too, right?”

“And if we are?”

“If so, you’d best turn back now. There are a group of powerful men ahead who specialize in hunting those bound for Fuyun City; several groups have already perished. My party were on their way to Fuyun City as well, but we were all killed — only my soul managed to escape…”

“How many of them are there?”

“A dozen or so, and among them are Third Stage Transcendent experts; they are vicious and cruel men.”

“Quite a number.” Yang Kai muttered.

“Exactly, young brother, I’ve told you the truth; will you—” The man asked meekly, but there was a wary glint in his eyes, as if, the moment Yang Kai made a move, he would stop at nothing to drag Yang Kai down with him.

That look, half-warning and half-threat, would deter many; he believed Yang Kai, lower in realm than himself, would not force the issue.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and stared at him.

The man’s heart lurched; just as his face contorted and he prepared to act, a golden light suddenly shot from the void.

Silently, the man’s soul was purified.

Only after absorbing the energy refined into essence did Yang Kai slowly open his eyes.

All around, a pair of curious eyes stared at him.

“That’s it, kid!” Li Wan clapped his hands together and burst into hearty laughter. “That fellow was truly unlucky.”

“Are you all right?” Fei Yu asked with concern.

“I’m fine, but we may have trouble ahead.” Yang Kai shook his head and repeated the intelligence he had just gleaned.

“A dozen or so?” Cang Yan raised an eyebrow. “That’s quite a number.”

“Yes. Had we not learned this, and carelessly blundered into them, we might have been taken by surprise and gotten into serious trouble.” Fei Yu nodded slightly.

“Should we go around them?” Mi Na asked softly.

“Why detour?” Li Wan chuckled nastily.

“Umm… so we just go straight through then?”

“Rest a bit longer, then we’ll continue on. If they don’t provoke us, fine; but if they dare attack…” Cang Yan’s aura changed abruptly, his gaze turning sharp as a blade, terrifyingly fierce, and his body exuded an ice-like hardness and extreme cold.

Calm and unafraid!

He even seemed to look forward to it!

Li Wan and Fei Jian felt the same, and even Fei Yu, a woman, was no exception.

Yang Kai brightened inwardly, silently concluding these four from the Tianxiao Sect were indeed a band of aggressive warmongers.
