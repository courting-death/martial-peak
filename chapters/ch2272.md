## Chapter 2272 — Men Die for Wealth

"What, the Imperial Treasure has taken form?"

As soon as Yang Kai spoke, the surroundings shook. Every cultivator stared at the Artifact Spirit of the demonic weapon in shock, their eyes gradually filling with greed.

Just the words "Imperial Treasure" were enough to make anyone drool, but an Imperial Treasure that could take form was unheard of, and its value was simply beyond estimation.

"Gulp..."

The sound of swallowing echoed as everyone stared at the Artifact Spirit with burning, greedy eyes. Countless Divine Senses intertwined in this underground space, probing to see if the Artifact Spirit was truly as Yang Kai had said.

After a moment, Qi Sihai shouted in a low voice, "It really is an Imperial Treasure!"

He could see the shadow of the Demonic Warhammer within the Artifact Spirit, and could clearly sense the Emperor Intent and Imperial Aura hidden inside it—things no Dao Origin Realm cultivator could possibly comprehend.

"It is indeed an Imperial Treasure..." Although Zhou Wuhu's gaze burned, his eyes were filled with deep wariness and vigilance. "But since it has already taken form, it won't be easy to deal with. Be careful, or you might end up with nothing but trouble."

Hearing this, everyone felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over them, and their excitement gradually cooled.

Yang Kai glanced at him and laughed loudly. "If you want good things, you naturally have to take risks. Since this sir is so cautious, why not leave now? Why are you still here?"

Zhou Wuhu coughed twice, looking embarrassed. "Just watching, just watching..."

Yang Kai said, "Although this Artifact Spirit has already taken form, it has been suppressed under the Eighteen Star Array for countless years. It's long past its prime and can't possibly display the full power of an Imperial Treasure. If any of you want to seize the treasure, why not join me in making a move? The treasure... will go to whoever is fated!"

As he finished speaking, he forced himself to rally, spread the Myriad Sword, and unleashed a rain of blades toward the Artifact Spirit.

Seeing him take the lead, the others could no longer hold back.

Although everyone knew that confronting an Imperial Treasure that had gained sentience carried great risk, faced with such overwhelming temptation, few could remain calm and unmoved.

In an instant, cultivators from all sides activated their Origin Qi, martial skills and secret techniques blossoming together, filling the underground space with multicolored light.

The few from Eight Directions Sect were also itching to act, but seeing Luo Yuan still standing motionless, they could only wait anxiously and watch for changes.

Boom, boom, boom...

Brilliant light flashed. The attacks of dozens of Dao Origin Realm cultivators all struck where the Artifact Spirit stood, making it impossible to see what was happening inside. Even Divine Senses sent out were completely devoured.

"Did we get it?"

"There's no movement at all. Did we really get it?"

Everyone craned their necks, staring toward the Artifact Spirit, their eyes full of anticipation and excitement, waiting wide-eyed for the result.

The light gradually faded, and the chaotic energies slowly calmed. But the scene that appeared made everyone's heart sink.

The demonic Artifact Spirit stood quietly in place. Although its glow was a bit dimmer than before, there was no sign of damage. Instead, being besieged by everyone had only provoked its fury. Its two crimson eyes were filled with savage violence, glaring fiercely around as if to memorize every face. Every cultivator it stared at felt a chill, as if hearing the call of death.

"Hiss... To withstand so many attacks unscathed—this Artifact Spirit is invincible!"

"How are we supposed to fight this?"

"Young Master Yang, things don't seem quite as you described..."

Yang Kai's mouth twitched. "Did none of you use your full strength? This Artifact Spirit doesn't seem very intelligent and has been suppressed for countless years. It shouldn't be this powerful!"

"Ahem..." Everyone looked embarrassed at his words.

Indeed, no one had used their full strength in that last attack, all hoping to save some energy to snatch the Imperial Treasure after the Artifact Spirit was destroyed. No one expected it to have no effect, and now, being called out by Yang Kai, they felt awkward.

"Not good, everyone attack with everything you've got! It's about to strike!" Yang Kai's expression suddenly changed as he shouted.

The demonic Artifact Spirit reached out and grasped at the air. Instantly, a pitch-black warhammer appeared in its hand—the very same one Yang Kai had seen inside it earlier. Clearly, this was its true weapon, covered in intricate runes that flickered like living things, containing profound mysteries.

An extremely dangerous aura spread out with the appearance of the warhammer!

For no reason, everyone felt as if they'd fallen into an ice cellar, their bodies turning cold in an instant...

Luo Yuan's pupils shrank as he realized something was wrong. He shouted to the others from Eight Directions Sect, "Fall back!"

As he spoke, his figure flickered and he suddenly appeared above the Artifact Spirit. Forming seals with both hands, Origin Qi surged through him as he chanted, "Blazing Sun Golden Wheel!"

A blazing, fiery little sun suddenly formed between his hands, instantly raising the underground temperature and making everyone's skin feel hot and dry.

Everyone sensed the immense destructive power of this secret technique and turned to look at Luo Yuan in shock.

The little sun in Luo Yuan's hands fell like a meteor toward the Artifact Spirit. Even before the attack landed, the Artifact Spirit sensed danger, black energy surging wildly as it roared again and again.

"What the hell are you all standing around for? Attack!" Yang Kai roared, already charging at the Artifact Spirit, swinging the Myriad Sword in a horizontal slash.

Only then did the other cultivators snap out of it, unleashing their martial skills and secret techniques at the Artifact Spirit once more.

This time, no one dared to hold back. They went all out, and the clash became several times more intense than before.

Even a true Emperor Realm expert would have no choice but to flee in the face of such attacks, unable to take them head-on.

Yet the Artifact Spirit didn't move at all. Whether from lack of intelligence or supreme confidence, as the attacks closed in it simply raised its warhammer high. Instantly, light flashed along the hammer and the intricate runes writhed.

The power of Law surged forth, forming an invisible force that covered several thousand zhang of the underground area.

Then, the Artifact Spirit smashed its hammer down.

The hammer struck only empty air, but space itself shattered, leaving a pitch-black void.

The shockwave seemed to transcend time and space, striking every attacker in the chest.

Puff, puff, puff...

In a single blow, all attacks were annihilated. Most cultivators turned pale, coughed up blood, and were sent flying. The others also looked terrible, their Qi and blood churning.

Luo Yuan also grunted, his Blazing Sun Golden Wheel breaking apart before it could harm the Artifact Spirit in the slightest.

Yang Kai fared no better. An invisible barrier suddenly appeared before the Myriad Sword, blocking his attack. The next moment, a tremendous force slammed into him through that barrier.

Puff...

Yang Kai spat golden blood, flying out like a ragged sack. His already battered body was now in even worse shape.

Rumble...

Suddenly, a buzzing sound rang out. Cracks split open in the ground and cave walls, and rocks of all sizes rained down. The eighteen spirit eyes were also shaken by the aftershock, all erupting at once, making the underground space even more unstable and on the verge of collapse.

"Not good—this place is about to collapse."

"Run!"

"Yang brat, you harbored ill intentions and incited us to attack. If I die, I won't let you off even as a ghost!" someone shouted while fleeing.

Yang Kai wiped the blood from his mouth and shot back, "Men die for wealth, birds die for food. You made your own choice, so take responsibility for it. Did I force you? If I told you to eat shit, would you do it?"

"You little bastard!" The man screamed in anger, but didn't dare stop for a moment, fleeing for his life.

The underground space instantly became chaotic as everyone scrambled to escape.

Yang Kai wanted to put Hua Qingsi and the others back into the Xuan Realm Pearl, but seeing the Artifact Spirit eyeing him like a tiger, he could only grit his teeth and say, "Go on your own!"

As he spoke, his figure flickered and he dashed off in one direction.

The Artifact Spirit relentlessly pursued him.

Soon, accompanied by tremendous buzzing, the ground trembled. In the wilderness two thousand li outside Fenglin City, a huge pit suddenly appeared. Inside, Spiritual Qi condensed into liquid, gradually pooling and rising as if about to form a spiritual lake.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...

Beams of light shot out from underground as cultivators, still shaken, escaped one after another, their faces pale.

In one direction, Yang Kai and the Artifact Spirit raced away, moving as fast as lightning.

"Hahaha! There's a road to heaven you refuse to take, but you barge into hell instead! Left and right protectors, seize this brat for me. I'll teach him a lesson!" an arrogant laugh rang out ahead.

Yang Kai looked over and saw three figures standing there. They were none other than Ning Yuanshu of Fei Sheng Palace and the two elders, Gao Shan and Liu Shui.

Clearly, they had stayed here all along and hadn’t left. Perhaps out of concern for Luo Yuan, they hadn’t ventured deeper into the underground spirit eye, but had lingered outside.

Now, seeing Yang Kai appear, Ning Yuanshu was overjoyed. As he gave the order, his face twisted with hatred and resentment.

Earlier, Yang Kai had slapped him in front of everyone, which Ning Yuanshu considered a lifelong humiliation. He swore to get revenge, and had been fretting over not finding Yang Kai. Who would have thought Yang Kai would walk right into his trap?

Although Gao Shan and Liu Shui had suffered a setback at Luo Yuan’s hands, that didn’t mean they couldn’t handle Yang Kai.

Ning Yuanshu was still very confident in the two elders’ strength.

"Brat, you heard the Young Palace Master! If you know what's good for you, come over quietly. I don't want to bully the weak and earn a bad reputation!" Gao Shan said coldly, staring at Yang Kai.

Liu Shui added, "That's right, brat—just surrender. The two of us are far beyond your ability to resist. If you fight back, you'll only suffer for nothing!"
