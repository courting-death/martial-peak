## Chapter 321 — Healing

Bilo followed closely behind Yang Kai, carefully cradling a dozen bottles of Pills for recovering Divine Sense in her arms. Her beautiful eyes continually surveyed his not particularly imposing figure, the complexity and frustration in her expressions evident.

Today's actions filled her with regret.

If she hadn't brought him to Letian Pharmacy, there would have been no trouble at all. The key point was her initial intent to let Le Yu teach him a lesson. As a result of her own viciousness, she offended him, yet he proved to be so powerful that he could stand against Le Yu without losing ground.

In a muddled haze, Bilo felt like an outsider, utterly embarrassed and disgraced.

As they traveled, Yang Kai's silence and cold demeanor sharpened her discomfort. 

After finally returning to the palace, Bilo couldn't hold back any longer. She quickly stepped in front of Yang Kai and blocked his path, fuming, "Why are you so silent?"

Yang Kai glanced at her faintly, a frown creasing his brow.

"Hey!" Bilo waved her hand in front of him, "What’s wrong with you? I know you’re very impressive, but you don’t have to ignore me, do you? I did want to take you to Letian Pharmacy and let Le Yu teach you a lesson because you were so annoying, but later I changed my mind. However, the situation was no longer under my control… Ah, I'm sorry, okay? Please don't be angry!"

Although Bilo was an orphan of humble origins, she was still the favored one in front of Shan Qingluo, known for her beauty and pride, often looking down on men.

Moreover, because of her unique preferences, she never really regarded any man with importance.

When Shan Qingluo brought Yang Kai back, not only did she grant him residence in Fenghuan Tower, but she also sent the three most beautiful women in the palace to serve him, which naturally annoyed Bilo.

She never had a good impression of Yang Kai; it was only out of respect for Shan Qingluo's orders that she interacted with him and didn't regard him highly.

It was only after today’s battle, where Yang Kai was able to hold his own against Le Yu, that Bilo realized this man was different from others. She understood why Shan Qingluo valued him so highly.

For her temper and arrogance, sincerely apologizing at this moment was already the limit of what she could do.

Standing there, Yang Kai furrowed his brow tightly, merely watching her without speaking.

Bilo’s expression darkened, growing increasingly frustrated, "I've apologized. Can't you forgive me? Didn’t they say all men are magnanimous? I see that’s not the case!"

Yang Kai suddenly reached out a hand, grabbing the collar of Bilo's clothing and pulling her in front of him.

In an instant, Bilo's face changed; she instinctively prepared to attack. But recalling Yang Kai's terrifying power, she quickly suppressed her urge and shouted, "What are you doing?"

"If you dare play tricks on me again, you'll be dead!" Yang Kai snorted coldly.

His tone was icy and resolute, leaving no hint of jest. Sensing his seriousness, Bilo's heart trembled, feeling a chill run down her spine.

Just as she was about to retort defiantly, Yang Kai suddenly released her, his complexion paling as he opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Within the blood, there was a trace of purple energy, writhing as if it were alive.

"Ah…" Bilo exclaimed, trembling.

"Get away!" Yang Kai swept out a palm wind, sending Bilo flying back several dozen zhang. The next moment, he was engulfed by a surge of purple evil fire, roaring with flames.

A chilling cold radiated outward. Yang Kai's hair and clothes turned pure white in an instant, as a wave of icy aura spread like a tangible substance.

Crackling sounds echoed out…

Centered around Yang Kai's position, an area of several dozen zhang was instantly frozen.

Bilo's beautiful eyes shook violently as she stared at Yang Kai in a daze.

It turned out that this man had not completely dissipated the power of Le Yu's attack. Instead, he had somehow sealed it within his body, and now it had erupted again.

This was the Purple Evil Energy from the Fiendish Cave!

It was not true fire, but an energy formed from the convergence of purple evil aura. Le Yu had refined and absorbed it and mixed it into his attacks.

This evil energy was extremely troublesome; once contaminated, it would invade like a wilting worm. Unless one’s strength greatly exceeded Le Yu's, they would eventually be consumed by this evil energy and perish from the freezing.

Bilo had only heard about it before; she had never witnessed it until today.

"You’re hurt?" Bilo asked, her voice trembling as she sensed Yang Kai's current state, her dissatisfaction instantly replaced by guilt.

"Of course it hurts! You try getting hit by that wolf-toothed club!" Yang Kai gritted his teeth and replied, taking a deep breath as he activated the True Yang Technique, repressing the Purple Evil Energy back into his meridians.

Le Yu was indeed a talented youth. Although it appeared that Yang Kai won the fight, the experts from the Le Family in the Divine Roaming Realm were already on their way to intervene.

But the true outcome was something only Yang Kai understood.

If the battle had continued, he wouldn't have been entirely confident of victory! After all, Le Yu was four minor stages higher than him.

Moreover, that wolf-toothed club had been exceedingly solid; even though he had the protection of the Thousand-Petal Blood Sea Begonia, Yang Kai had still been injured, his internal organs shifted, and it was only now he hadn’t caught his breath.

"What should we do?" Bilo asked anxiously.

"Heal! Do you have a pig's brain?!" 

"Oh, let’s hurry back!" Bilo quickly said, stepping forward to support Yang Kai as they rushed toward Fenghuan Tower.

Despite Yang Kai's insult, Bilo felt no annoyance at all. At the very least, she could feel from his tone that he was no longer that angry.

Fenghuan Tower.

Upon their return, Yang Kai went straight to the first floor, hastily shedding his clothes and diving into the warm bath.

Outside, three women attending to Yang Kai and Bilo stood together.

"What happened to the young master?" the enchanting woman Yunli sensed that something was off and softly asked.

"We fought with Le Yu and he got injured," Bilo softly replied.

"Ah…" Yunli covered her crimson lips in alarm, her beautiful eyes filled with disbelief, "You fought with the young master of the Le Family? Why did you fight?"

"Don’t ask, I was in the wrong." Bilo sighed, handing the Pills in her arms to Ruoyu and Ruoqing with a despondent expression.
	
Yunli studied her intently for a moment before understanding many things and chose not to ask further.

"Sister Yun, it seems he still holds a grudge against me. What should I do to apologize so that he’ll forgive me?" After a moment of silence, Bilo suddenly asked.

"Apologize?" Yunli looked at Bilo in surprise, a glimmer of curiosity in her beautiful eyes as she teased, "Bilo actually knows how to apologize? This is quite unexpected! Are you perhaps…?"

"No!" Bilo shot her a glare before suddenly grinning mischievously, "You harlot, what are you thinking? Do you want me to teach you a lesson so you don’t feel so deprived?"

"Don't!" Yunli jumped back in fright, subtly distancing herself from Bilo.

"Then tell me, what should I do?"

Yunli smiled sweetly, a rosy blush blooming on her cheeks, and said softly, "A woman's body is the best weapon…"

"You're really full of this kind of stuff! I'm not talking to you any longer." Bilo huffed and warned, "You all watch carefully. I’ll head back first. If anything happens, remember to notify me."

"Understood." Yunli and Ruoyu, Ruoqing nodded.

In the bath, Yang Kai closed his eyes, focusing on circulating the True Yang Technique.

The waves of Purple Evil Energy flowed through his meridians, being purified by the pure True Yang Yuan Qi. Some of the incompatible energy was expelled from his body, while other parts were absorbed by the Indomitable Golden Body.

Though this energy was also exceedingly evil, it, in essence, belonged to the same source as the energy within the Indomitable Golden Body, but there were evident differences.

This energy was cultivated by Le Yu, mixed with his understanding of martial arts and his seal, enriched with his aura.

The imprint of Le Yu’s understanding of martial arts was incompatible with Yang Kai and could only be expelled.

What remained was the Purple Evil Energy extracted and refined from the Fiendish Cave by Le Yu. After refining, this energy could be absorbed by the Indomitable Golden Body.

Evil energy was difficult to dispel, requiring Yang Kai three or four days to gradually dissolve and refine the purple energy within his meridians completely.

Within the Indomitable Golden Body, a surging sensation emerged, as if the so-called Purple Evil Energy was quite to its liking, which made Yang Kai's heart stir.

Though Yang Kai's battle with Le Yu had ended without a conclusion, it had firmly stabilized his strength at the Fifth Stage of the True Yuan Realm.

Yang Kai had also gained insight into what true peak experts among his peers looked like.

So far, he had only encountered a few troublesome opponents: Wu Chengyi from the Jiu Xing Sword Sect, Qiu Yimeng from the Qiu Family, and now Le Yu.

Each had extraordinary backgrounds, and their strength reminded Yang Kai not to underestimate anyone.

The world was vast; who could say how many prodigious experts like them were out there?

Slowly opening his eyes, Yang Kai felt refreshed as his injured organs returned to their rightful places. The water in the bath had turned a sinister shade of purple, quite a sight to behold.

Rising from the bath, he dried off the moisture on his body, dressed, and walked out.

Yunli and Ruoyu, Ruoqing brightened upon seeing him emerge.

"Has the young master's injury healed?" Yunli hurriedly stepped forward to inquire.

"Yes," Yang Kai nodded.

"That's good." Yunli sighed in relief and turned to Ruoyu and Ruoqing, saying, "Go inform Miss Bilo that the young master has recovered, so she doesn’t have to worry anymore."

"Okay!" Ruoyu and Ruoqing responded before turning to leave.

Yunli looked at Yang Kai meaningfully, smiling as she said, "You don’t know, but Miss Bilo has come several times these days, checking on how you’re doing with your injuries. I think she hasn’t been resting well and looks quite fatigued."

"She brought it on herself," Yang Kai snorted.

Bilo's concern for him was not out of genuine worry, but from fear that Shan Qingluo would punish her if she found out. Yang Kai could see through this.

Yunli smiled gently, "Bilo is still young and somewhat naive. Having lived in the palace for so long and being doted upon by the elders, she has indeed been spoiled. Young master, you’re magnanimous; there’s no need to lower yourself to her level."
