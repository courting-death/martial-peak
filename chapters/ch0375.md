## Chapter 375 — The Shock of the Blood Servants




Yang Kai was conversing with two Blood Servants when, in another room, Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, who had just finished bathing, were unable to rest. A maid from the Lü family came to report, "Miss Qiu, the family head asks if you are free to speak now?"

Qiu Yimeng flicked her damp hair, her gaze flickering as she immediately understood Lü Liang's intention. With a slight frown, she said, "Please ask him to come in."

"Yes!" The maid respectfully retreated, and before long, Lü Liang walked in.

Chuckling, Lü Liang said, "Miss, the Lü family is not like the Qiu family; we are humble in our means. I hope you’ll forgive any shortcomings."

Although they were meeting privately, Lü Liang dared not overstep by calling her 'dear niece' excessively. A couple of times as a playful indulgence was enough; repeating it might offend her.

Lü Liang was shrewd and crafty; how could he make such a low-level mistake?

Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly and said, "You are in a hurry to see me, I presume you want to inquire about Yang Kai?"

Seeing her speak directly, Lü Liang was not overly surprised. He withdrew his smile, by then looking solemn, and said, "Precisely. The world is chaotic now, and the situation is uncertain. I seek the young lady’s wisdom on how the Lü family should position itself in this tumultuous era!"

He then clasped his hands together, a serious expression on his face.

Qiu Yimeng lightly chuckled and sat by the table, glancing at him before asking, "Are you thinking about why I brought him to your Lü family? Is this action to hint at something to you?"

"You are exceedingly insightful, Miss. Indeed, I was thinking that way," Lü Liang readily admitted. The Lü family relied on the Qiu family for their current standing, so it could be said that the Qiu family had greatly helped the Lü family.

Now, at such a sensitive time, Qiu Yimeng's choice to bring Yang Kai to visit the Lü family naturally made Lü Liang ponder deeper thoughts.

Could it be that Qiu Yimeng saw potential in Yang Kai? Thus, she wanted to help the Lü family gain an opportunity to ride on Yang Kai’s coattails?

Was this a guaranteed deal of mutual benefit?

Could it be that Qiu Yimeng was well aware of Yang Kai’s background and connections, prompting her actions?

...

Countless speculations spun through Lü Liang's mind over the past half-day.

Qiu Yimeng furrowed her delicate brows and said softly, "Your thoughts are not wrong. I know you are astute, but I can tell you that bringing him here was not meant to imply anything to you."

"Not meant to?" Lü Liang was taken aback.

"Not at all!" Qiu Yimeng nodded slightly, her beautiful face showing a hint of anger. "I came to the Lü family solely to borrow two Treading Cloud Steeds!"

"Ah..." Lü Liang was momentarily dumbfounded. All his thoughts that had been causing him headaches were really just because Qiu Yimeng wanted this.

He chuckled awkwardly, "The matter of the Treading Cloud Steeds is easy to arrange. I’ll have someone prepare them by tomorrow."

"Mm." Qiu Yimeng nodded slightly.

Lü Liang opened his mouth, appearing hesitant to speak. Qiu Yimeng knew what he wanted to ask and spoke first, "I don't know how solid his background is, but I won’t underestimate him. He often does unexpected things and can leave people astonished and awed."

Lü Liang was moved.

Qiu Yimeng’s evaluation carried heavy weight.

Regardless of how much background Yang Kai had, one could infer from Qiu Yimeng’s words that his personal talents were undoubtedly impressive!

Reflecting on the nuances, Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but grit her teeth, her beautiful face tinged with irritation. "Moreover, he tends to repay grievances tenfold!"

Lü Liang caught the chill in her tone and instinctively shrank his neck. He wondered if Yang Kai had offended her at some point, judging from Qiu Yimeng’s expression; she seemed to have suffered quite a bit.

He quickly became contemplative, not observing, not hearing anything.

"It seems he acts purely based on his preferences. He’s both righteous and wicked, difficult to deal with! I advise you not to make him your enemy," Qiu Yimeng said with a light laugh.

"Please instruct me, Miss!" Lü Liang replied solemnly.

"Absolutely do not become his enemy!"

Lü Liang was stunned, replying earnestly, "I shall remember that."

"That’s all." Qiu Yimeng nodded slightly and chose not to say more.

Knowing she was dismissing him, Lü Liang naturally did not linger, bowing politely before retreating slowly.

Before he reached the door, Qiu Yimeng called out again, "By the way, if you really want to take a gamble in the fight for the throne, you must seize this opportunity. The sooner you gravitate towards a certain Young Master, the greater the benefits you will reap in the future!"

Lü Liang nodded in agreement and suddenly asked, "What about you, Miss? Which side will you stand on?"

In the struggle for succession, the other seven major families of Zhongdu would definitely participate, and the Qiu family would not be an exception. As the foremost individual of the younger generation, Qiu Yimeng might very well lead the charge this time.

"Do not concern yourself with me. The future and fate of the Lü family lie in your hands. Which Young Master’s camp you choose to join is your own decision. In the end, whether success or failure, sweet or bitter, you'll face the consequences," Qiu Yimeng smiled lightly.

Lü Liang felt a bit disappointed, aware that Qiu Yimeng’s statement was meant to avoid accountability for advice she might give now.

Not wishing to dwell further, he bowed and retreated.

The next day, dawn arrived.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian had just emerged from their room when they saw Yang Kai slowly practicing what appeared to be a mundane set of boxing and kicking techniques under the rising sun.

His movements were slow, yet his expression was meticulous, and there was a solid rigor in his forms.

"The young master rises quite early," Tang Yuxian smiled coyly.

"Youth possesses abundant vitality, which is a good thing," Tu Feng chuckled.

"Yet the boxing and kicking techniques the young master is practicing seem rather ordinary. It's suitable for normal people to use for fitness, especially for the elderly," Tang Yuxian couldn't help but laugh, covering her mouth.

Tu Feng shot her a glare, signaling her not to speak carelessly.

Although he also regarded the boxing and kicking techniques Yang Kai was performing as unimpressive, he should uphold decorum as a Blood Servant of the Young Master.

If the Young Master enjoys it, let him practice; it was merely a game after all, and there was no real danger.

Suddenly, Tu Feng's expression sharpened. He whispered, "Something feels off!"

"What is it?" Tang Yuxian asked hurriedly.

"Watch closely," Tu Feng's face turned serious as Tang Yuxian focused intently on Yang Kai's movements.

Suddenly, her pupils constricted.

She noticed that Yang Kai's muscles had seemingly tightened to the extreme, and beneath his feet, the ground was damp, clearly from the sweat dripping down and wetting the earth.

Facing the rising sun, Tang Yuxian clearly saw the glistening beads of sweat rapidly forming and flowing down his forehead and exposed skin.

The slow movements of his boxing and kicking techniques seemed exceedingly heavy, causing the ground to tremble faintly with every step he took.

This...

These signs were clearly indicative of someone under immense pressure.

However, the set of boxing and kicking techniques Yang Kai practiced was merely a seemingly ordinary routine. Just moments ago, Tang Yuxian had even commented that it was suitable for the elderly to strengthen their bodies. How could it possess such power?

After observing closely for a while, both Blood Servants had to acknowledge that Yang Kai was indeed bearing a tremendous amount of pressure. Within his tight muscles lay an incredibly terrifying destructive force; however, this force was being forcibly contained within him under some inexplicable pressure, unable to be released.

In other words, the power within him was resisting that pressure, maintaining a balance at his personal threshold.

What kind of pressure?

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian exchanged glances, both deeply shocked. Unconsciously, they released their Divine Sense, locking it onto Yang Kai, closing their eyes to empathize with his experience.

A subtle feeling emerged, and as Yang Kai's boxing and kicking routines unfolded, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian gradually immersed their consciousness into his vicinity.

Taking advantage of his movements, they slowly grasped the mysteries of his technique.

Empathic resonance!

Boom...

A feeling akin to the sky suddenly collapsing struck them, as if the entire expanse was pressing down on them.

Crack!

A violent sound erupted; where Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian stood, the ground suddenly sank in.

A spiderweb of cracks spread outwards in all directions.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian simultaneously opened their eyes, faces filled with terror, their eyes wide with fear as their True Yuan involuntarily circulated to fiercely resist the weight of the world pressing upon them.

However, the terrifying force they had previously sensed vanished instantaneously the moment they opened their eyes.

Their full-strength explosion, lacking a point of release, caused their surging True Yuan to explode inside their bodies.

Two muffled groans echoed; Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's faces turned pale as they staggered backward several steps.

"Wow..."

They both coughed up blood simultaneously, feeling much better afterward.

Yang Kai turned sharply, his brows furrowed.

He was aware that while he practiced the Proud Bone Golden Body technique, the two Blood Servants were behind him and felt their Divine Sense probing him. However, he never expected it would elicit such dire consequences.

No one had ever scrutinized him in such detail while utilizing the Proud Bone Golden Body technique, let alone delve into the extent of pressure he bore.

Caught off guard, the two Blood Servants had already sustained injuries.

Hastily withdrawing from his boxing and kicking moves, he rushed over to them and asked, "Are you alright?"

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's eyes trembled as they stared at Yang Kai, bewildered, as if they were looking at a monster.

The pressure they had felt moments ago was undeniably real.

Both had experienced it; how could that possibly be false?

But how was this young master standing there completely unharmed under such immense oppressive force? With his strength and physical prowess, he should have already been crushed to dust. Yet here he was, untouched, while they, two masters at the Divine Roaming Realm, had accidentally injured themselves.

If this matter got out, would the other Blood Servants not laugh themselves to death?

For a moment, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian felt both astonishment and embarrassment.

They were left with a single question in their minds: how had the young master survived such pressure?
