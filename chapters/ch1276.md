## Chapter 1276 — Expelling the Poison

Just as Daiyuan had said, the Thousand Illusions Glaze was unaffected by the Five Elements — it truly seemed to be so. The radiance emanating from her body pierced straight through the defenses of his Sea of Consciousness and fell upon his Divine Sense itself. Even his Divine Sense Fire showed faint signs of being suppressed.

Fortunately, Daiyuan had not been deliberately targeting Yang Kai, and Yang Kai himself was no ordinary man; after a brief shock he immediately withstood the assault of the Glazed Light, his Divine Sense Fire thundered forth, enveloping Daiyuan.

At that moment Daiyuan's features contorted with intense pain, making her already flawed appearance all the more repulsive to behold. What puzzled Yang Kai was that it was not only her face that was marred — her entire body, like her visage, was covered in pitted scars, not at all the sort of bewitching beauty ordinary women possessed.

Earlier, when she had been clothed in a black undergarment, Yang Kai had not noticed much; but once she entered the Yin Pool the garment soaked through and clung tightly to her, and when Yang Kai then cloaked Daiyuan with his Divine Sense he immediately discovered the problem.

Her whole person seemed flawless only at the two exposed hands; every other part of her body, like her face, was pitted and scarred, making it unbearable to stare at.

It was obvious the Thousand Illusions Glaze technique's harm was extraordinary! Yang Kai instantly understood that the reason she had become like this was absolutely tied to the Thousand Illusions Glaze technique.

"Junior Brother Yang..." Daiyuan bit her lip and, trembling, called out.

Yang Kai inclined his head and called sharply, "Begin!"

The next moment Daiyuan, without hesitation, opened an acupoint at her chest and frantically drew the Yin Pool's water into her body. The bitterly cold liquid entered her delicate frame and she trembled uncontrollably, yet she still gritted her teeth, lips gone pale, her bright eyes fixed on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai said nothing; his Divine Sense Fire likewise surged into that acupoint and, in an instant, etched several sets of spirit formations used for pill-refining inside Daiyuan's body.

"Divine Sense Fire!" A look of astonishment bloomed in Daiyuan's eyes — she had never expected Yang Kai to possess Divine Sense Fire. According to her original plan, Yang Kai should have placed his hand on her chest and poured his Saint Yuan into her body, using her as the cauldron and the medicinal properties in the Yin Pool's waters as materials, employing pill-refining methods to drive out the Glaze Poison.

During their earlier discussion of the details, Yang Kai had never revealed he possessed Divine Sense Fire, yet now that it had appeared Daiyuan was not alarmed but rather relieved, for if that were the case there would be no need for intimate physical contact with her body.

This realization both shocked and greatly comforted her; after all, she was still an inexperienced woman, and being touched by another man could be hard to bear.

As her opened acupoint served as the center, the flesh within a three-inch radius swirled as the Yin Pool's water rushed. Under Yang Kai's control, the various medicinal efficacies Daiyuan had earlier mixed into the Yin Pool combined perfectly; an uncomfortable sensation spread from her chest, her breathing grew heavy, as if something obstructed her, and all her strength could not be mobilized.

But as Yang Kai engraved one spirit formation after another, under their influence the conflicting medicinal effects in the pool fused together and a peculiar strand of luminous qi was forced out from Daiyuan's chest and flowed into the Yin Pool.

That thread-like thing did not dissipate, however, but swam in the pool like a fish, unimpeded.

Soon another strand was forced out, and as time flowed more and more filaments issued from Daiyuan's body, filling the entire Yin Pool with these oddly glowing threads.

After a full half hour, Daiyuan suddenly felt the stifling sensation in her chest vanish; the blocked Saint Yuan began to circulate, and the previously hard-to-resist chill no longer posed a threat to her.

Overjoyed, Daiyuan could not wait and immediately released her Divine Sense to examine herself.

Within the flesh centered on the previously opened acupoint there was no trace of the Glaze Poison, and the surface had finally returned to a normal state — fair and rosy, skin delicate, no longer marred by that pitted, ugly appearance.

However, because of the Yin Pool's soaking she still displayed some bruising, forming a stark contrast with the other parts of her body.

A mist suddenly clouded Daiyuan's eyes and her spirit trembled, almost causing more of the Yin Pool's water to pour into her body.

"Guard your mind, do not think of anything else; once this is finished you can inspect fully!" Yang Kai's stern command suddenly sounded at her ear, snapping her out of her surprise. She looked up at him — he sat cross-legged, channeling Divine Sense Fire into her and fusing the medicinal effects — and discovered his expression calm, showing no hint of embarrassment. She nodded and opened another acupoint to draw more Yin Pool water in.

Yang Kai immediately cooperated again without the slightest hesitation.

Beneath his Divine Sense, though he could see every part of Daiyuan's body, as if she stood naked before him, this was a matter of life and death and not for idle thought; his face was serious as he spared no effort in urging the Yin Pool's medicinal efficacies.

This Yin Pool already contained a great quantity of medicinal materials Daiyuan had thrown in, so dispelling the Glaze Poison itself was not difficult; the true difficulty lay in controlling the blending of the effects and Daiyuan's own capacity to endure them.

The former was manageable since Daiyuan herself was a pill-refiner; when Yang Kai exercised his Divine Sense Fire she needed only to slightly cooperate to trigger the medicines' effects.

The latter, however, was beyond Yang Kai's aid and wholly depended on Daiyuan's own will.

The Glaze Poison had penetrated deep into her body; each time it was expelled it took not only toxins but some of her life-origin as well. A round or two would not be fatal, but repeated many times she might not survive this trial.

Indeed, each expulsion required at least the time of one incense stick, and after half a day the purification had progressed less than one-fifth, yet Daiyuan was already staggering, her face as pale as paper.

Fortunately, Daiyuan had prepared well; at this point she took some pills from her Spatial Ring and swallowed them all at once, which returned a little color to her face.

Seeing this, Yang Kai eased his movements somewhat to give her enough time to refine the medicines' effects.

But neither dared waste too much time; continual immersion in the Yin Pool was enormously draining, so after a brief rest the two of them resumed the process.

Time passed bit by bit and the Glaze Poison within Daiyuan's body was drawn out little by little, yet Yang Kai's expression grew increasingly grave.

He could not tell whether Daiyuan could pass this test, for she had begun to overdraw her life-origin just to barely sustain bodily functions and cooperate with him in driving out the poison; such a method could not last forever, and if she could not hold on she would certainly die.

Even if she could hold on, Daiyuan would need a long period of recuperation afterward.

But matters had reached this point and there was no turning back; whether it was Yang Kai or Daiyuan, both had to persevere and see it through.

Perhaps sensing Yang Kai's gaze, the suffering Daiyuan suddenly opened her eyes and forced out a smile more wretched than tears: "I can do it, Junior Brother Yang — do not worry, act without restraint!"

Yang Kai's face remained indifferent; feeling her determination, he nodded slightly without saying more. His Divine Sense Fire erupted once again, and sets of spirit formations were carved into Daiyuan's utterly unguarded body, manipulating the Yin Pool's waters and their medicinal effects to cleanse her frame.

Daiyuan screamed again, a sound rended with misery, as if undergoing some inhuman torture.

Another day passed, and most of Daiyuan’s body had already recovered to normal. Under Yang Kai’s Divine Sense probe, he confirmed that she indeed possessed the kind of allure few women could compare to—skin fair and tender, flawless as frost and snow, delicate enough to break at a touch, her figure graceful and refined. Even her face no longer bore the slightest trace of its former disfigurement. At this moment, aside from a faint pallor on her complexion, not a hint of her previous appearance remained. What she now revealed was a breathtakingly beautiful countenance—one capable of stirring the heart of any man who beheld it.

Coupled with her present, ravaged appearance from the torment, she seemed especially fragile.

Yang Kai had expected this and showed no surprise, remaining focused on his task.

At one moment Yang Kai quietly withdrew his Divine Sense Fire, then thundered in a voice like an explosion: "Hurry and swallow the Blood Zhi Mushroom!"

Daiyuan seemed nearly bereft of consciousness; her lovely eyes were dim and vacant, and she had been mechanically cooperating with Yang Kai, the last thread of obsession within her keeping her from giving up.

Yang Kai's shout brought a flicker of clarity to her dazed eyes; she hastily took the wooden box containing the Blood Zhi Mushroom from her Spatial Ring, opened it and swallowed the mushroom at a gulp, then took the jade vial Yang Kai had given her and poured the potion entirely into her mouth.

The miraculous medicine took effect and Daiyuan finally began to recover; the unnatural pallor on her face flushed with color, blood circulated, and the vast vitality contained within the Blood Zhi Mushroom spread throughout her body, replenishing the life-origin she had lost.

Before she fully refined the Blood Zhi Mushroom's efficacy, Yang Kai once more cloaked her with his Divine Sense Fire.

The outcome hinged on this final moment; if Daiyuan's will proved strong enough there was a thirty percent chance she could endure, but if not, then it was simply her fate running out and no one's fault.

Daiyuan understood this better than anyone and cooperated with all her might.

In an instant the entire Yin Pool surged, its waters frantically poured into her body, layers of white mist enveloped her, and strands of strangely glowing filaments were forced out from Daiyuan's body.
