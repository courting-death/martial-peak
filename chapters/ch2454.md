## Chapter 2454 — Insane Beyond Belief

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said, "I've just remembered Heavenly Wolf Valley. Once this is all over, I have a favor to ask of you, Miss Lan. I hope you won't refuse me."

Lan He replied bitterly, "If I survive, as long as it's not too much, I'll agree to anything."

"Don't worry, we won't die." Yang Kai laughed heartily.

Lan He looked at him strangely, not knowing where he got the confidence to say such things. Was he blind, unable to see that they were surrounded by dozens of Dao Origin Realm cultivators? These Dao Origin Realm cultivators weren't ordinary martial artists; they were all elite disciples from major Sects. If they joined forces, even an Emperor Realm master couldn't withstand them.

Did he really think he was stronger than an Emperor Realm master?

"Brat, you still dare to boast so shamelessly!" a burly man suddenly shouted angrily. With a twist of his wrist, an axe appeared in his palm, energy surging, his aura extraordinary. He said, "If you know what's good for you, surrender quietly. We might let you die with your body intact. But if you stubbornly resist..."

"Pah..." Yang Kai spat, a glob of saliva shooting toward the burly man like an arrow loosed from a bow.

The burly man, who had been shouting non-stop, turned pale and quickly dodged to the side. Although the spit wasn't lethal, if it hit him, it would be extremely insulting.

After regaining his footing, the burly man said with a dark face, "Are you a child? Spitting at people—have you no shame?"

Yang Kai sneered, "All of you are glaring at me like tigers eyeing their prey, and you talk about shame? I spit at you and that's shameless? Ridiculous."

Yin Lesheng snorted, "Enough with the nonsense. Today, you will die without a doubt."

“Oh really?” Yang Kai shot him a cold look, then stepped forward, his presence commanding. “I’d like to see which one of you is blind enough to try and lay a hand on me. Let me make this clear—if anyone dares attack, I’ll make sure none of you leave here alive!”

As soon as he spoke, everyone's expressions changed, all becoming grave.

The astonishing strength Yang Kai had displayed earlier was still fresh in their minds. So even though his words sounded like bluster, they couldn't help but feel apprehension, fearing he might go all out.

For a moment, dozens of people stood frozen, unwilling to be the first to act, each hoping someone else would make the first move so they could reap the benefits afterward.

Yin Lesheng clearly saw through this, his face darkening as he shouted, "Since you're all so timid, when I seize his Origin, don't get jealous!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly waved his hand forward and shouted, "Netherworld Purgatory Hand!"

A fierce yin wind arose, accompanied by the sudden sound of ghostly wails. A massive ghostly shadow appeared, its face twisted and ferocious, lunging at Yang Kai.

Before the ghostly shadow even reached him, Yang Kai felt a chill seep into his bones, as if his very blood was freezing.

Before he could react, Lan He, standing beside him, suddenly shouted, "Heavenly Wolf Howls at the Moon!"

The sound of a wolf's howl rang out. As Lan He pointed forward, a lithe silver wolf appeared out of thin air, enormous and majestic, just like the Heavenly Wolf itself, opening its bloody maw to bite at the ghostly shadow.

In an instant, the two strange beings collided, setting off a wild battle.

At the same time Yin Lesheng attacked, several disciples of the Netherworld Sect also made their moves. Chang Hao and Chang Xian of Brahma Heaven Sacred Land exchanged glances, quickly forming hand seals, seemingly preparing some secret technique.

Seeing others take the lead, the rest no longer stood by. They all summoned their Secret Treasures and unleashed secret techniques, attacking Yang Kai together.

In an instant, the void was filled with dazzling lights of every color, energy surging chaotically.

Lan He's face turned deathly pale, she stood dazed, her eyes dim, as if all light had left them.

With so many Dao Origin Realm cultivators attacking at once, there was no way she could resist. All that awaited her was death.

At that moment, Yang Kai suddenly let out a long howl. As a flash of light appeared, a broad longsword materialized in his palm. Imperial Aura erupted, and he stood there like an immovable mountain, slowly turning the sword as he chanted in a low voice, "One sword sweeps a million, a lone man holds the pass!"

The air was torn apart by rapid slashing sounds.

Countless sword lights shot out, sweeping toward the enemy like a plague of locusts.

Thunderous explosions rang out, the collision of energies creating a terrifying spectacle that made everyone's hearts tremble in fear.

"Imperial Treasure!"

"Who is this brat, to actually have an Imperial Treasure in his hands!"

"Don't let him get away, kill him!"

Although many of the cultivators who entered the Shattered Star Sea were elite disciples or even direct descendants of Sect Masters and Elders from major Sects, Imperial Treasures were still rare. Aside from a select few, most had no right to possess one.

Now, seeing Yang Kai take out an Imperial Treasure, dozens of cultivators instantly went wild with excitement.

In their eyes, Yang Kai was nothing less than a walking treasure vault.

Not only did he have a complete Stellar Origin, but he also had an Imperial Treasure. If they could kill him and seize his possessions, they could become rich overnight and own an Imperial Treasure themselves.

For a moment, everyone's hearts burned with greed.

After the clash, Yang Kai staggered backward, a sweet taste rising in his throat before he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Although he relied on the power of the Myriad Sword to barely withstand the combined attack of dozens, he was still just one man. How could he possibly fight so many? He only managed this much because they all held back at first. If they'd gone all out, he wouldn't have gotten off with just minor injuries.

"Damn it, you really dared to attack me together!" Yang Kai glared ahead, gritting his teeth and shouting in anger.

Yin Lesheng snorted, "It's too late to beg for mercy now. Today, you will die without a doubt!"

Chang Hao shouted anxiously, "Hand over that Imperial Treasure, quickly!"

The others said nothing, but the greed in their eyes made their intentions clear.

Yang Kai grinned ferociously, and in a flash, appeared in front of the Mountain and River Bell.

Yin Lesheng's face changed as he cried out in alarm, "What are you doing?"

Yang Kai laughed loudly, "What am I doing? Isn't it obvious? I told you before, anyone who dares to attack me will die without a grave!"

His gaze swept over the crowd, his face twisted with madness.

"Are you insane?" Yin Lesheng seemed to realize Yang Kai's intent, his face turning deathly pale. The others were also terrified, their legs going weak.

Yang Kai's face was cold, his eyes icy as he said grimly, "You forced me into this."

As he spoke, he suddenly raised the Myriad Sword high above his head.

"Wait, let's talk this out! There's no need for this!" Chang Hao shouted in terror.

"It's too late for words. All of you, die!" Yang Kai roared, bringing the Myriad Sword down hard on the Mountain and River Bell.

"It's over!" Seeing this, Yin Lesheng broke out in a cold sweat, turned, and fled without looking back.

"Run!" Chang Hao also shouted, "This guy's gone mad!"

Boom...

The Myriad Sword struck the Mountain and River Bell, and a deep, thunderous bell sound exploded out, visible sound waves sweeping madly in all directions.

Yang Kai bore the brunt of it. Even though he desperately circulated his Origin Qi to protect himself, he couldn't help but stagger, nearly fainting on the spot, and spat out a mouthful of blood.

The dozens of Dao Origin Realm cultivators who had turned their backs to flee didn't fare any better.

This place was a natural formation, and once inside, there was no way out. No matter how they tried to escape, it was useless. When the sound wave hit, it swept them all up at once.

Earlier, on that dark red star, a young man had been killed instantly just by lightly touching the Mountain and River Bell. Now, Yang Kai was smashing it with an Imperial Treasure, and the backlash was on a completely different level.

After the sound wave, everyone spat blood, and even the light from their defensive Secret Treasures dimmed considerably.

Not only that, but the sound wave seemed to have a suppressive and sealing power. After it swept through, everyone was frozen in place, as if trapped in a quagmire, unable to move at all.

Boom...

Before they could recover, another loud crash rang out.

Everyone shuddered and turned to look, only to see Yang Kai once again slam the Mountain and River Bell with the Imperial Treasure, his face twisted in a wild grin. Laughing maniacally, he shouted, "Feels good, doesn't it? Come on, tell me—does it feel good? Louder! I want to hear you say it—does it feel good or not?"

"Madman... he's a madman!"

"This guy has lost his mind."

"Why did you idiots provoke him? Now we all have to die with him."

"Stop, stop! Let's talk, please, I'm begging you!"

"Brother Yang, it's better to resolve enmity than to create it. Instead of dying together, why not sit down and talk?"

As the terrifying sound wave swept over them again, everyone began wailing and begging, hating him to the core but forced to put on a smiling face and say things they didn't mean.

"I won't listen!" Yang Kai coughed up blood as he shook his head, raising the Myriad Sword for the third time. "Dragging all of you down with me—I'd call that a win! Today, none of you are leaving here alive!"

"Sir Yang, I'll give you my Spatial Ring, just spare my life!" someone suddenly shouted.

Yang Kai paused, sniffed disdainfully, and shouted righteously, "Do you take me for someone who'd sell out for a bit of money? Don't insult my character by thinking I'd stoop so low!"

The man was stunned, not knowing how to respond.

Yang Kai asked in a deep voice, "Is there anything good in the ring?"

Everyone was speechless.

The man was also stunned, not understanding what Yang Kai meant, until a nearby cultivator nudged him. Only then did he realize and hurriedly said, "Lots of good stuff, plenty! I guarantee you'll be satisfied, Sir Yang."

Yang Kai immediately beamed and said, "See, wouldn't it have been better to say that earlier? You just had to suffer first. Aren't you a glutton for punishment?"

"Yes, yes, I'm a glutton for punishment!" the man replied, his mouth twitching.
