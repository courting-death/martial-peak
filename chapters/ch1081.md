## Chapter 1081 — Determination

Before this, Yang Kai wasn't entirely sure how much the Soul Chain had affected him, but the instant the Soul Chain was undone he finally understood that this soul Art, the Soul Technique, contained far too many profound mysteries.

It could not only bind two people's life forces tightly together, it could even make two people inexplicably develop affection for one another, making them unwilling to leave each other's side.

A chill ran through Yang Kai's heart as he wondered secretly: if Xue Yue hadn't used it on such a young man but on an old man with half his head buried in earth, or on a woman, what would the result have been?

Would it also turn two people into a pair steeped in passionate devotion?

The very thought made Yang Kai shiver.

But now it was fine—the Soul Chain had been completely severed with both parties' consent, and the feelings it had forced upon him evaporated like mist; apart from a little lingering regret, he no longer felt that clinging attachment.

In appearance, status, and cultivation alike, Xue Yue was a fine woman; any man would feel lament at missing such a match.

The moment the Soul Chain was broken, Yang Kai reached out, tore open the void, and fled a thousand li away.

Xue Yue had said that once freed from the Soul Chain's bonds she might do anything; Yang Kai thought it quite possible she would stop at nothing.

After all, he knew so many of her secrets and had been so intimate with her—given her cruel nature, it would be strange if she let him go without consequence.

That was why Yang Kai first used his Star Shuttle to leave Rainfall Star, and only at the limit of the shuttle's range did he sever the Soul Chain with Xue Yue—to buy himself a little buffer to flee, lest she turn on him immediately and make escape impossible.

After tearing space ten times in succession, Yang Kai was already tens of thousands of li away, popping pills to restore his Divine Sense while forcing the Star Shuttle to fly at full tilt.

He constantly felt a killing intent at his back, like a shadow that would not leave him.

More than ten days later in the Star Domain, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on his Star Shuttle and let it carry him along.

He had already inscribed a Star Chart within the shuttle and was heading for a distant place; Rainfall Star had long since vanished from sight, and looking back he could only see a scatter of glittering stars.

Having fled for over ten days without any pursuers, Yang Kai felt he should be safe—otherwise, with Xue Yue's resources, they would have caught up long ago.

He even planned various escape schemes: if cornered, he'd dive into a void eddy and not come out; Xue Yue would have no way to get him then.

Just as he relaxed, Yang Kai sensed several life forces intruding into the reach of his Divine Sense.

A Divine Sense, imbued with subtle spatial insight, brushed out and withdrew; before those men had a chance to notice, Yang Kai had already grasped details about them.

Three of them—three First Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivators—none particularly high in strength; each piloted a Star Shuttle and were rushing toward him. Yang Kai could tell they'd been flying within the Star Domain for some time and were heavily exhausted.

Were they sent by Xue Yue or merely passing by? Yang Kai couldn't tell. He quietly concealed his aura and flew off in another direction, planning to avoid them and not create extra trouble.

But to his surprise, after changing direction several times, those three kept shadowing him persistently, clinging like maggots to a bone, and as time passed their distance closed ever tighter.

At this point in life, if Yang Kai still couldn't guess the three's purpose he'd wasted his years.

These three were definitely pursuers sent by Xue Yue; otherwise their target wouldn't be so specific.

Yang Kai sat motionless on his Star Shuttle, squinting at what trailed behind, and stopped moving forward.

What did Xue Yue mean by this? Three First Stage of the Saint King Realm cultivators to take him back?

She knew his strength; back on Shuiyue Star, when he had reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm he slew a Saint King Realm warrior, and now at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm, three such men surely couldn't capture him.

She had stronger subordinates—Halika and Lin Mufeng were both Origin Returning Realm level; there were plenty of Second or Third Stage Saint King-Grade warriors in branch halls, and at her command even Halika would have to come.

Yet she only sent three First Stage men!

Was she using these three's lives to sever ties with him and show her inner thoughts and determination?

It fit her temperament; seeing through her intent, Yang Kai grinned.

Fine—this made the last trace of regret in his heart vanish.

If they ever met again, Yang Kai believed Xue Yue would certainly try to kill him and wash away her shame; she would never be as coquettish as she had been recently.

Yang Kai was resolved not to be entangled with that woman again and expected no future intersections with her.

He remained seated while the three's Divine Senses swept about obliviously, clearly failing to detect his presence.

Only when they drew near did the three suddenly light up as if discovering a new world; their Divine Senses that had been scanning about snapped back and shot toward him.

Seeing the three idiots stop not far in front of him and take up a triangular cordon, each wearing a look of aggrieved anger, Yang Kai knew they must have been harried by Xue Yue and had no choice but to come.

Since Xue Yue sent them as lambs to the slaughter, they must have offended her somewhere and incurred her displeasure.

Yang Kai barely knew them and had never met them; killing them carried no emotional burden.

“Kid, you dare touch the woman of the Third Young Master Xue Yue? You've got guts. Though that woman is all looks and no substance—she annoys me—but her status isn't something scum like you can touch. We were ordered to bring you back alive. Cooperate and you'll suffer less; otherwise we'll break your hands and feet and leave you between life and death!” the burly man on the left barked.

“Damn, in all my years I've never piloted a Star Shuttle out into the Starry Sky; after taking such a loss for that woman, kid, how're you gonna make it up to me?” the young man in front scowled at Yang Kai, his eyes full of fury, evidently blaming Yang Kai for their suffering.

Flying a Star Shuttle through the Starry Sky wasn't pleasant; cultivators usually rode warships between training stars and could return in three to five days on routine scouting missions.

But this time they'd chased for over ten days, each exhausted to death and their Saint Crystals heavily depleted.

Such losses naturally had to be recouped from Yang Kai.

“Heh heh, that woman only told us to bring this kid back—she didn't say to bring his stuff. I heard before he fled he used her name to get Halika and Lin Mufeng to open the storeroom and took out a lot of good things. Just tens of thousands of Upper-Level Saint Crystals!” the last man said, greed shining in his eyes.

“Really?” The burly man and the youth both fixed their gaze on the Spatial Ring on Yang Kai's finger, their looks scorching.

Tens of thousands of Saint Crystals were no small sum; any of the three would be tempted.

“Indeed, I took fifty thousand Saint Crystals,” Yang Kai chuckled and raised the ring. “They're all inside. Oh, and there are some Saint King-Grade herbs and five-element ores—altogether worth no less than a hundred thousand Saint Crystals.”

Hearing this, all three involuntarily breathed a little heavier, their greed and covetousness thick and nearly tangible.

“Kid, hand over the ring and I promise not to touch a hair on you—provided you cooperate!” the burly man stretched out a hand and shouted loudly.

“Want it? Answer one question first,” Yang Kai smiled.

“Talk if you've got something to say; don't piss around—get this done so we can go. I don't want to stay here a second longer,” the burly man snapped impatiently. Flying a Star Shuttle in the Starry Sky was dangerous: it constantly drained one’s power and there were star storms and speeding meteors that could smash you dead.

None of them would have taken this thankless task if not forced by that woman's threats; even Lord Halika had been left helpless by her anger.

Seeing Yang Kai show some willingness to cooperate, the burly man hurriedly urged him on.

“How did you find me? Not that I look down on you, but your three couldn't possibly tail me so precisely for so long.” Yang Kai asked with curiosity.

The three glanced at each other and chuckled.

The burly man didn't hide it: with a flip of his hand a colored ribbon appeared, and when he tossed it out, as if guided by some force, it flew straight toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's expression shifted and he snatched the ribbon out of the air.

It still lingered with the sweet fragrance of Xue Yue.

“Just this?” Yang Kai frowned. “What is it?”

“You ask me—who should I ask?” the burly man laughed broadly. “Before we left, that woman handed it to me and said to follow its guidance and we'd find you. We owe our chase to it.”

Yang Kai studied him and felt the man had no reason to lie.

He then eyed the ribbon and suddenly understood, grit flashing in his teeth: “That damned wench!”

In that moment he realized where the trick lay; that woman was indeed conniving—what seemed a simple pre-departure talk had been used by her to this degree.

The drink Xue Yue prepared at that time was nothing more than a distraction—there truly hadn’t been any drug in it. It was only meant to lull him into a false sense of security after he refused it. All along, her true intent had been to bite his neck while weeping in rage and grievance.

When she bit him, she must have done something subtle and secret to his body; otherwise, how could she possibly locate him later with just a single ribbon?
