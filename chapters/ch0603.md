## Chapter 603 — Not Interested in Your Lower Half

The Spider Mother issued a warm invitation, and Yang Kai, unperturbed, leapt down into the gorge and came to a halt before that enormous spider statue.

"Heh heh, young brother, your courage truly is great," the Spider Mother's pleasant voice continued to enter his mind.

From all directions the giant spiders, each the size of a calf, rapidly stirred, wagging heads and tails as they closed in on Yang Kai's position, soon encircling him. Pairs of small eyes emitted a faint glow as they fixed upon him; through their mouths they spat white silk threads, and a rank, fishy stench filled the air.

These giant spiders were all Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts. By rough count at least forty or fifty of them had gathered in the gorge, and the smaller ones were beyond number.

Yang Kai had also heard that the Spider Mother and the Thunder Beast King had joined forces, and when they assaulted Zhongdu they would temporarily heed his command; correspondingly, the Spider Mother had reaped no small benefit from the Thunder Beast King.

These Sixth-Tier giant spiders were likely a variety cultivated through the Thunder Beast King's methods.

The last time Yang Kai had been trapped here, he had never seen so many giant spiders.

The ground trembled faintly, as if some colossal being were emerging from within the spider statue.

After a moment, the Spider Mother finally made her appearance.

Her lower body was that of a vast spider, but her upper body was the form only an exquisite beauty could possess: a flawless, stunning face, graceful shoulders and curves—and her bosom, exposed to the air, firm and upright, remarkably springy, pale and tender, each topped by a cherry-like crimson swell, exquisitely rendered; they seemed capable of stirring a man's lust, making one wish to leap forward and bite into those two cherries to taste their wonder.

Seeing the Spider Mother in this state, Yang Kai could not help but be astonished. He sneered, "It seems the Zhongdu campaign benefited the Spider Mother quite a lot."

The last time he had seen her she only had a beautiful face and no woman's upper body, yet now she already possessed a delicate, alluring female torso that stirred the imagination.

The Spider Mother laughed coquettishly. "Indeed, I devoured the True Yuan and flesh of many masters and thus evolved into this form. The taste of those masters' True Yuan and flesh—truly splendid! But when Cangyun Evil Land was routed I had to flee back; thinking on it now, I miss that flavor."

Saying so, she gazed at Yang Kai with bright eyes, her scarlet tongue trailing across her lips. "Your flavor is also most delightful; I wonder how you would taste."

"Want to eat me?" Yang Kai pointed at himself and laughed uproariously, then shook his head. "Spider Mother, the idea is not a bad one, but you likely lack the capability."

The Spider Mother smiled faintly. "You are that confident?"

"Don't take on work you lack the skill for. Since I dared to come, I am confident I can deal with you." Yang Kai's expression turned abruptly cold.

The Spider Mother's pretty face grew serious. Though she was half human and half Demonic Beast, her intellect was not inferior to any human expert, and she at once perceived the source of Yang Kai's brazen confidence.

She did not fully understand what he relied upon, but it was enough to set her on guard.

"I could also choose not to deal with you," Yang Kai said, smiling lightly, his manner composed. "I'm not here to fight you. If you refrain from going to Zhongdu to wreak havoc on those people, then you have nothing to do with me."

"Oh?" The Spider Mother appeared surprised. "Then young brother, what did you come here for?"

"To strike a deal with you!" Yang Kai announced loudly.

"What sort of deal?"

"Tell me how to resolve the Poison Widow Lineage's problem, and in return I'll tell you how to become human!" Yang Kai did not waste words; Shan Qingluo was still in Piaoxiang City waiting, and he had to finish swiftly.

"You know the secret of becoming human?" The Spider Mother's expression suddenly leapt with excitement as she cried out sharply.

Seeing her intense reaction, Yang Kai's face brightened; his conjecture had indeed been correct. The Spider Mother was formidable—so far the only Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast he had encountered—but to such highly intelligent beasts, the greatest goal was indeed to assume human form.

Moreover, she was actively striving in that direction.

"Have you ever heard of the Huasheng Pool?" Yang Kai smiled calmly and cast out his bait.

"The Huasheng Pool?" The Spider Mother's eyes glittered, her slender form trembling; she asked with suspicion, "What is that?"

"A pool that can help you become human, a pool of miraculous power!" Yang Kai explained.

"Where is it?" Her excitement only increased; she stepped forward a few paces and an oppressive aura descended, her breath turning dangerous.

Yang Kai shook his head slowly. "If you want to know where it is, you must first tell me how to neutralize the deadly poison harbored within the Poison Widow Lineage."

In truth, he himself did not truly know what the Huasheng Pool was.

He had only heard mention of it from Shui Ling while in War City.

When Shui Ling first encountered the Spider Mother, she had said that without the Huasheng Pool, the Spider Mother would never in her life become human.

That remark revealed a significance Yang Kai had not forgotten; from it he had merely gleaned that the Huasheng Pool must be the pivotal pool that could help the Spider Mother assume human form.

The Spider Mother's excitement rapidly subsided; she stared at Yang Kai in a daze, then slowly laughed, "How would I know whether you speak true? The Huasheng Pool, ha—I've never heard of it."

"Not having heard of it does not mean it does not exist. Do you plan to keep this form forever? Do you not desire to truly become a person?" Yang Kai mocked as he looked at the Spider Mother. "This form is awful."

"Do not carp at my appearance!" The Spider Mother grew agitated; she clearly felt displeased at her half-human, half-Demonic Beast form.

After a long silence she asked, "You came asking me because of that Enchantress Queen, did you not? How is she now? Has her infatuation fully formed so that she must consummate with you?"

"You seem to know rather clearly." Yang Kai felt a stir in his heart. The Spider Mother knew so much; she was obviously more familiar with the secrets of the Poison Widow Lineage than anyone else—after all, that constitution had been discovered stemming from her.

"Very well, I will make this deal with you!" The Spider Mother nodded lightly. "First tell me where the Huasheng Pool is, and I shall tell you how to dispel the Poison Widow constitution."

"Do you take me for a three-year-old?" Yang Kai sneered and shook his head. "I do not trust you."

"Nor do I trust you." The Spider Mother laughed flirtatiously. "It seems we must employ certain means to make you behave."

With those words, the giant spiders gathered around Yang Kai began to stir, evidently having been given orders by the Spider Mother and preparing to take action against him.

"You may try—if you make a move we'll see which of us dies!" Yang Kai roared, and with a gesture a immense Bone Shield suddenly materialized before him.

The Bone Shield was as large as several rooms, its surface densely marred by the scars of countless cuts; along its edges the bone spikes that once jutted out were even broken in places.

And yet now that Bone Shield emitted an aura that made the Spider Mother feel disquieted, as if it teetered on the brink of destruction.

"What kind of Secret Treasure is this?" The Spider Mother involuntarily retreated several paces, her face filled with dread.

"A Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure!" Yang Kai sneered as he leisurely explained. "This treasure was originally only the size of a washbasin, but it can absorb energy directed at me. The more energy it absorbs, the larger it grows, and the absorbed energy can be released by me in one instant. Now that it has become so enormous, consider how much energy it must have taken in—could you withstand it?"

Moreover, that energy was not ordinary energy at all; it was the void power that had erupted from Zhongdu's underground.

Even Transcendent Realm experts could not withstand it.

If he truly fought the Spider Mother, Yang Kai himself was not without confidence, but in this situation the Bone Shield unquestionably carried greater deterrent.

The Spider Mother's pretty face finally changed color; she ground her teeth and glared at Yang Kai with hatred. After a long moment she suddenly pursed her lips and laughed coquettishly, the twin snow-white peaks of her chest bobbing enticingly as she said in a sultry voice, "You will not kill me — you still want to learn the method from me."

Yang Kai shrugged. "True enough. But now we can talk properly, and devise a secure method acceptable to both sides, one that lets each of us obtain what we desire."

"I cannot think of such a thing." The Spider Mother adopted an expression of indifference and tossed the problem back to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned and fell into thought. After a long while, as if struck by an idea, he spoke aloud: "How about this: your soul slips into my Sea of Consciousness; I will lay the Huasheng Pool's secrets open for you to see. That way there can be no deceit."

"Oh?" The Spider Mother's eyes brightened and she licked her crimson lips. "Aren't you afraid I'll harm you? You don't look foolish."

"If you prefer, my Divine Sense can enter your Sea of Consciousness, if you trust that," Yang Kai said with a faint smile.

The Spider Mother shook her head.

Each person's Sea of Consciousness is their deepest secret; one would never casually allow another to enter. Though Yang Kai's proposal sounded sincere, the Spider Mother suspected ulterior motives.

"Then you may enter my Sea of Consciousness. We shall each open to the other the secrets we wish to know; in that manner both sides obtain answers. Besides, my strength is lower than yours—you need not fear encountering danger in my Sea of Consciousness." Yang Kai's face turned grave. "If you still refuse this proposal, then I will have no choice but to gamble: kill you, bind your soul, and search your soul for what I seek."

As he spoke, Yang Kai's gaze grew icy, as if he truly would strike if the Spider Mother did not agree.

The Spider Mother's pretty face shifted, and she bared her teeth. "Why be so rash? I never said no. Young brother, after we exchange secrets, can we not have a soul union? Your soul's scent is very sweet—I like it."

"Spare me." Yang Kai's expression darkened. "I'm not interested in your lower half."

"Heh heh heh..." The Spider Mother laughed flirtatiously. "So that means you're interested in my upper half, then?"

"Are you coming or not? Enough chatter." Impatience showed on Yang Kai's face.

"Coming, coming—lower your Sea of Consciousness defenses." The Spider Mother called out as her soul slipped free of her body and surged toward Yang Kai's mind.
