## Chapter 548 — Rematch with Liu Qingyao

Indeed, where was that expert who claimed to be Meng Wuya? The battle had dragged on until now, yet he had not made a move. Why did he refrain? Was it out of disdain or was he simply not present here?

“This is dragging on too long,” Kang Zhan frowned deeply. A foreboding feeling gripped him—perhaps the wound Yang Kai inflicted upon him last time had left a psychological shadow. In any case, whenever Kang Zhan thought of Yang Kai now, his heart would quail with unease.

Gao Rangfeng nodded lightly. Over these months of the Succession War, Gao Rangfeng had also sparred repeatedly with Yang Kai alongside Yang Zhao. Each time, Yang Kai’s mansion produced surprising figures, accomplishing feats and glories no one dared to imagine.

This time, it seemed the Seven Great Families were confident of crushing Yang Kai’s mansion. Yet who could say there wouldn’t be another twist in the end?

Miracles were no rarity in Yang Kai’s mansion.

“I’ll go help!” Huo Xingchen’s eyes flickered; without waiting for Ye Xinrou’s reply, he rushed forward.

Ye Xinrou’s beautiful eyes glinted, and with a cold snort, surprisingly did not try to stop him.

“I’ll deal with the Young Master!” Liu Qingyao stepped out decisively.

At this, Ye Xinrou’s composure faltered, and she hurriedly said, “Young Master Liu, no – you aren’t his match…”

Before she could finish, she swallowed her words as Liu Qingyao fixed her with a cold gaze. Although Ye Xinrou was currently the nominal leader of the Seven Great Families’ allied forces and disregarded Gao Rangfeng and Kang Zhan, ruling with Yang Zhao’s name, before Liu Qingyao she still harbored an instinctive fear.

This was a scar from living long under the shadow of Zhongdu’s first Young Master.

Ye Xinrou wanted to say Liu Qingyao was no match for Yang Kai, but she knew those words would only anger him.

“The battle at Po Jing Lake—I said that when the Young Master reached Divine Roaming Realm, I would fight him properly. Now that time has come. If anyone dares stop me, don’t blame me for being impolite,” Liu Qingyao said calmly.

Ye Xinrou forced a smile and softly warned, “Then, Young Master Liu, be careful. I wish you victory and hope you can humble Yang Kai’s arrogance.”

Below, Huo Xingchen had already reached outside Yang Kai’s mansion, smiling broadly as he greeted a group of young commanders outside.

They all glared at him fiercely.

None understood how the situation had come to this. The Huo Family was joining the attack on Yang Kai’s mansion tonight, naturally earning no favor from these men.

Huo Xingchen was indifferent, instead staring at Dong Qinghan and saying, “Fatso, come out. This Young Master has long disliked you. You’re fat like a pig yet always try to look suave. How could you compare to me, even a fraction of my style?”

“What did you say?” Dong Qinghan’s face grew cold, his gaze freezing on Huo Xingchen.

“You must have heard it if you’re not deaf,” Huo Xingchen said, tilting his head with a careless expression.

Dong Qinghan chuckled—a slight tremor in his plump face. Then he strode forward, cracking his knuckles loudly as he moved.

“That’s more like it,” Huo Xingchen laughed. “Just a son of a first-class family dares to associate with a rogue like Yang Kai? Today you’ll see if I don’t beat you to a pulp!”

He then turned to the others with a sneer. “And you idiots, if you don’t want to die young, you’d better leave Yang Kai’s side as far as you can!”

The faces of those men darkened considerably.

“Not convinced? Then come spar with me. I’m waiting right here,” Huo Xingchen sneered.

Han Xiao Qi frowned as she stared at him. Suddenly, she called out sharply, “Teach him a lesson! Let this so-called superior Young Master know we’re not easy to provoke.”

The next moment, over a dozen men charged, pounding Huo Xingchen fiercely.

After several breaths, Huo Xingchen was like a dead pig, lifted by Dong Qinghan and thrown into Yang Kai’s mansion. He ordered his subordinates, “Strip him and lock him in the cellar for days. Damn it, how dare he insult my weight?”

Seeing this, Gao Rangfeng and Kang Zhan exchanged strange looks, a sour sense of dissonance growing deep in their hearts.

“Young Master Huo was captured alive—what should we do now?” Meng Shanyi suddenly said with a smile.

“A clumsy trick!” Ye Xinrou snorted coldly, paying no heed. Whether Huo Xingchen lived or died was irrelevant as long as the Huo Family’s experts remained.

While Huo Xingchen was captured, Liu Qingyao sought out Yang Kai.

“The fight at Po Jing Lake last time was unsatisfactory. I’ve come to ask the Young Master for a contest. I hope you will oblige,” Liu Qingyao said faintly as he looked at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded slightly. “Young Master Liu, forgive me, I’m in a hurry. Please be quick.”

Liu Qingyao nodded in understanding and said no more. In the next instant, his aura suddenly burst forth, True Yuan surging wildly.

Stepping forward lightly, a heavy thud reverberated through heaven and earth.

The Liu Family’s Nine-Curve Steps!

At Po Jing Lake last time, Liu Qingyao had used this move against Yang Kai. It was a secret art of the Liu Family, rated at Middle-Level Mystery-Grade, and Liu Qingyao’s strongest strike.

But this time was different. Last time, because of the overwhelming difference in realms, Liu Qingyao had held back out of fairness.

This time, he unleashed it with full force, his aura more intense and forceful than ever before.

Thud… step after step, each landing like drums of war pounding, shaking ears and hearts, causing bodies to tremble.

Thud thud thud…

Liu Qingyao’s figure seemed to grow larger, grander.

When he landed the ninth step, he had transformed into a colossal giant.

He touched the sky and stepped on the earth, majestic and mighty—this entire realm seemed supported by him.

Nine steps struck, earth doomed and heaven condemned! This was the Liu Family’s Nine-Curve Steps.

As the ninth step landed, Liu Qingyao’s aura soared to its peak, nearly reaching the summit of the Divine Roaming Realm.

That immense, unparalleled foot pressed down unwaveringly and slowly upon Yang Kai’s head.

All involuntarily felt an illusion that this foot would crush them into dust.

Weaker fighters shivered, pale and terrified.

Facing this terrifying strike, Yang Kai simply raised his fist and struck upward.

A plain, straightforward punch yet harboring destructive power.

The fist met that giant foot, and in that instant, countless fist shadows flickered wildly.

Liu Qingyao’s momentum collapsed immediately; the massive figure withered, toppling backward.

With a thunderous crash, the giant fell and dissolved into twinkling lights.

Liu Qingyao, still suspended midair, let out a muffled groan, spat a stream of blood, and staggered back, clutching his chest, eyes filled with shock and wary respect toward Yang Kai.

“Much obliged!” Yang Kai took a light breath.

“Impressive!” Liu Qingyao sincerely praised. “I’m defeated. Thank you, Young Master, for your mercy.”

At Po Jing Lake last time, Liu Qingyao had to counter this skill with Star Mark, a Mystic-Grade martial skill of the same rank.

But this time, Yang Kai defeated the Liu Family’s secret art with a mere casual punch.

Their power levels were clear at a glance.

“Young Master Liu, you’re welcome,” Yang Kai said coldly.

“Though I lost, I do not decide this side’s matters. I beg your pardon, Young Master. I can only say that I will not meddle further. Farewell.” As he spoke, he vanished swiftly into the night sky.

“Young Master! Young Master!” Liu Family’s experts watched in shock as Liu Qingyao left without a word, calling out urgently.

But got no response.

Ye Xinrou’s expression turned deathly pale.

In a mere hour, three Young Masters and Misses had withdrawn.

Qiu Yimeng’s withdrawal was entirely her doing—deliberate.

She neither stopped nor cared about Huo Xingchen’s departure; though his body remained, his heart was with Yang Kai’s mansion. Staying would only obstruct the view, better to leave quickly.

But Liu Qingyao’s exit was intolerable to Ye Xinrou.

After all, Liu Qingyao was known as Zhongdu’s First Young Master. His conduct carried weight, even influencing public opinion.

The prestige of Liu Qingyao among the world was significant.

How could Ye Xinrou not be furious?

Now, only three remained by her side.

Kang Zhan, Gao Rangfeng, and Meng Shanyi—whether they shared her intentions was uncertain. Kang Zhan and Gao Rangfeng were better; Meng Shanyi was inscrutable.

“Are the three of you also planning to quit?” Ye Xinrou looked at them preemptively.

“Ye, you worry too much,” Kang Zhan shook his head. “This matter involves the Eight Great Families. How could we withdraw rashly? Doing so would be irresponsible.”

Gao Rangfeng nodded in agreement. Though somewhat sympathetic toward Yang Kai’s plight, they barely knew him and cared little. They only needed to follow their family’s orders.

Seeing their stance, Ye Xinrou relaxed slightly and nodded. “Then I can rest assured. Such a grand occasion, I cannot stand alone—I still need brothers to assist by my side.”

Her posture involuntarily softened, a marked contrast to her previous demeanor at Yang Zhao’s mansion.

The successive withdrawals of Qiu Yimeng, Huo Xingchen, and Liu Qingyao dampened the morale of the three remaining groups of experts. Without their own Young Masters, an uneasy feeling of doing work for others crept in, causing them to act more cautiously and focus on self-preservation.

Especially the Qiu Family’s experts who bore the brunt as vanguards—they now avoided direct confrontation, waiting passively for reinforcements.

Each was shrewd; no one wished to suffer loss unnecessarily.

Though the Seven Great Families’ alliance appeared united, it was fraught with cracks and riddled with flaws, inviting mockery.
