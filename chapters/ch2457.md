## Chapter 2457 — Collapse of the Void

Yang Kai's face was ashen, his hands weaving seals without pause, Origin Qi surging relentlessly. It took a tremendous effort to finally block that strand of black Qi.

But looking down, he saw that the front half of his right arm had been corroded to a ghastly state, blood streaming down. The black Qi he had stopped writhed and struggled like a living thing, desperately trying to crawl up toward Yang Kai's shoulder.

Yang Kai suddenly looked up, glaring at Yin Lesheng, and growled, "You dare ambush me!"

Yin Lesheng was stunned. That Shura Earth Fiend was a secret art of the Netherworld Sect, never passed down except to the very best disciples. To cultivate it one had to connect to the true Netherworld Purgatory and condense the Earth Fiend's power with Netherworld Yin Qi. Once mastered, the secret art was boundlessly powerful—anyone below the Emperor Realm was virtually powerless to resist and would die upon being struck.

Earlier, he had quietly hidden a wisp of Shura Earth Fiend in his Spatial Ring. When Yang Kai took it, he suddenly activated the secret art's power, and sure enough, Yang Kai was caught off guard.

But what shocked him was that Yang Kai actually managed to block the Shura Earth Fiend. Though he looked badly injured, his vitals were untouched, and his life was in no real danger.

After a brief daze, Yin Lesheng snapped back to his senses. His figure flickered, and like a great roc spreading its wings, he lunged at Yang Kai, face twisted in a snarl as he roared, "Vengeance brooks no delay! Ten years is too long—Yang Kai, die!"

At the same time Yin Lesheng attacked, Chang Hao and Chang Xian also struck. Their Origin Qi surged, and whatever secret art they used caused their bodies to merge into one, transforming into a streak of flowing light that crashed toward Yang Kai with overwhelming force.

The others quickly reacted as well, shouting as they charged at Yang Kai.

Earlier, they had been forced to hand over their Spatial Rings and had been holding in their anger. Now, seeing Yang Kai ambushed by Yin Lesheng and looking badly hurt, they naturally wanted to seize the chance for revenge.

"Yang Kai, run!" Lan He cried out in alarm, seeing the situation change in an instant. She hurriedly called out to Yang Kai in a low voice.

Yang Kai's face twisted, whether from pain or something else. A hint of madness flashed in his eyes as he said in a low voice, "There's no escape."

He couldn't make sense of this natural formation at all. Unless he had time to calmly study it, there was no way to break free. He raised the Myriad Sword and fiercely struck the Mountain and River Bell, shouting, "You want my life? I'll send you to your graves first!"

Boom...

As the Myriad Sword struck, a halo of light suddenly rippled out from the Mountain and River Bell, and a terrifying sound wave swept forth. Everyone's eyelids twitched, and in an instant, they were wailing and screaming.

But to everyone's surprise, the sound wave didn't spread far. Instead, it exploded on the spot, blasting Yang Kai away.

“Hahaha! Heaven may forgive the sins of fate, but never those we bring upon ourselves!” Chang Hao burst out in delight. He didn’t know why the Mountain and River Bell’s reaction was so different this time, but it was clearly the perfect chance to kill Yang Kai. He shouted with all his might, “Everyone, attack together! Let’s make sure this Yang fellow dies with no grave to his name!”

The others' spirits lifted, and they all charged forward.

Yang Kai's head was spinning, his senses reeling from the shock. The Mountain and River Bell's strange reaction had caught him completely off guard—he had never expected such a thing, nor did he know if it was the Artifact Spirit's doing.

At that life-and-death moment, the Mountain and River Bell trembled on its own. The void abruptly collapsed.

The natural formation that had covered that stretch of void crumbled and vanished. In its place, a black hole the size of a house appeared. The Mountain and River Bell turned into a streak of light and shot straight into it, disappearing in a blink.

The black hole rapidly expanded, and an immense, irresistible suction poured out, pulling at every cultivator's body.

"What's happening!"

"What is this?!"

"No, we have to get out! The space here is collapsing!"

"Yang Kai, you monster!"

Everyone shouted in panic, utterly terrified. Even Yin Lesheng, who had been hell-bent on killing Yang Kai, turned pale and no longer cared about Yang Kai's fate. He spun around, trying to escape.

But the suction from the black hole behind them was unimaginably strong. No matter how hard he tried, he could only struggle in place, unable to move an inch away.

As the black hole expanded, the suction grew even stronger and more terrifying, filling every cultivator with despair and helplessness.

Yang Kai and Lan He, being closest to the black hole, were the first to be sucked in and vanished.

Moments later, one cultivator after another screamed as they were swallowed by the black hole in all sorts of bizarre postures, panic-stricken and helpless.

In less than ten breaths, every one of the dozens of cultivators was pulled in—none escaped the black hole's pull.

And the black hole kept expanding.

Until, at a certain point, it seemed to reach its limit, then suddenly contracted toward its center and vanished in an instant.

The void returned to calm, but a dense fluctuation of spatial power lingered, bearing witness to the upheaval that had just occurred here.

...

In a daze, Yang Kai regained consciousness. The first thing he heard was Lan He's voice calling out.

His arm still throbbed with unbearable pain—a pain that seemed to reach his very soul, as if even his Divine Soul was being torn apart.

He had a vague sense of what had happened earlier, but after being blasted at close range by the Mountain and River Bell's sound wave, his mind had been shaken and he hadn't had the presence of mind to check his surroundings.

All he remembered was the formation of a black hole and the immense suction pulling him in—then he ended up here.

If not for possessing the Warm Spirit Lotus, a supreme treasure, that shock alone would have been enough to destroy his soul.

The shouting by his ear grew clearer. Yang Kai shook his head, finally regaining some clarity. He turned to look, but couldn't see anything at all—there wasn't a trace of light here, only utter nothingness. A familiar feeling immediately welled up in his heart.

"Void Passage!" Yang Kai's eyes lit up as he exclaimed.

This was clearly a rift in the void—a passageway within the void itself.

Void Passages could exist anywhere in the world, but without understanding the Power of Space, one could never sense them, let alone enter. Thinking back to what had just happened, Yang Kai immediately realized that he had ended up in this Void Passage because the Mountain and River Bell had suddenly erupted, shattering the void with overwhelming force.

That black hole was the most obvious sign.

Enduring all sorts of discomfort and pain, he quickly released his Divine Sense and, sure enough, soon found Lan He not far away.

At this moment, Lan He was in dire straits, entangled by a current of void turbulence and unable to move.

The Void Passage was fraught with danger, and the greatest threat was this kind of void turbulence. These river-like, formless currents were made of chaotic spatial power. Once someone was caught, it was nearly impossible to escape—one could only wait to be devoured by the current.

Even Yang Kai had to be careful of these currents when traveling through the Void Passage.

Though Lan He was quite strong, she didn't understand the Spatial Power. Once trapped in void turbulence, she was utterly helpless and could only await death.

Yang Kai rushed to her side and called out, "Miss Lan He!"

Lan He was startled, then called out softly, "Yang Kai?"

"Yes, it's me."

Lan He said, "I'm trapped by a strange force and can't break free. Don't come any closer."

She was afraid Yang Kai would end up like her, so she quickly warned him.

Yang Kai grinned and said, "Don't worry, it's just void turbulence. I'll get you out."

Lan He shook her head. "No, I tried—the harder you struggle, the deeper you sink. It's like a quagmire. If you try to help, it'll only make things worse. If you ever get out of here, go to Heavenly Wolf Valley in the Eastern Territory and tell them Lan He died here."

She seemed to have lost all hope of survival and was even arranging her last words.

Yang Kai said nothing, squatting down beside her and quietly sensing the situation.

Lan He spoke for a while, and seeing Yang Kai remain silent, she said sadly, "Right, take my Spatial Ring out with you and give it to the people of Heavenly Wolf Valley."

As she spoke, she was about to remove her Spatial Ring.

But Yang Kai suddenly reached out and struck toward her position. Instantly, spatial power surged, turning into an invisible, gentle force that influenced the void turbulence.

In a moment, the surging void turbulence was calmed, and Yang Kai reached out and pulled Lan He out of it.

Lan He was momentarily stunned, unable to believe she had been rescued so easily. For a moment, she just stood there in a daze. Then, suddenly realizing what had happened, she blurted out in shock, "Could it be—you've mastered the Power of Space?"

Yang Kai chuckled and said, "I know a thing or two."

Lan He exclaimed, "Are you a disciple of Lord Li Wuyi?"

Li Wuyi again. Yang Kai had heard this name more than once and already knew he was a renowned expert in the Star Realm, possessing the formidable cultivation of the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm and mastery over Spatial Power.

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to call him the number one expert beneath the Great Emperors.

Yang Kai shook his head. "I've heard of him, but never met."

He didn't intend to continue this topic and said, "Let me take you somewhere safer. I still need to heal."

Lan He, recalling how Yang Kai had been ambushed by Yin Lesheng, quickly said, "That Shura Earth Fiend is a secret art of the Netherworld Sect, its corrosive power is extremely strong. Anyone below the Emperor Realm who is struck will surely die. How are you unharmed?"

Yang Kai laughed. "Just lucky, I guess. Or maybe Yin Lesheng hasn't mastered it."

The Shura Earth Fiend was indeed terrifying. Yang Kai reckoned that if any other Dao Origin Realm cultivator had been struck, there would have been no way to survive. But his strength was far beyond that of ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivators—whether in physique, Origin Qi, or Divine Sense, he surpassed that level by a wide margin. That's why he could suppress the Shura Earth Fiend.

Even so, half his arm had been corroded beyond recognition.
