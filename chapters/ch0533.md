## Chapter 533 — Don’t Let Her Eat You to the Bone

Outside the mansion, Xiang Tianxiao led the warriors of his family, bidding farewell to Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng.

The setting sun dipped low in the west as the Second Young Master straightened his back and strode forward with long, decisive steps.

He bore no shame nor regret.

Behind him were fewer than ten followers.

When he had first come to join Yang Kai, he had brought over twenty warriors along with four full trunks of supplies, but after countless battles—big and small—only this handful remained.

The rest had fallen in battle, their blood and flesh forging one glorious victory after another for Yang Kai's mansion.

After watching the silhouettes of Xiang Tianxiao and the others disappear from view, Yang Kai withdrew his gaze.

Among those people, he knew the names of only Xiang Tianxiao; he had never exchanged even a word with the others. Yet still, that did not diminish the respect and gratitude in his heart.

He felt the same for the others from various factions in the mansion. Without these gathering forces, no matter how strong he was, he could hardly have made waves in the contest for succession all on his own.

Qiu Yimeng suddenly felt a pang of sorrow.

These were the first warriors to leave Yang Kai’s mansion—not due to disputes over profit or mortal grudges, but bound by ethics and family obligations.

“With Xiang Tianxiao leading the Xiang Family, things should be much better,” Yang Kai said, inhaling deeply.

At least, he was more reliable than someone like Xiang Chu. If the Xiang Family were to be inherited by him in the future, Yang Kai would not mind forming an alliance with them, turning clashing swords into peace.

Qiu Yimeng brushed her hair behind her ear and smiled lightly. “By that logic, you’ve actually done the Xiang Family a favor.”

“Too bad the Xiang Family won’t appreciate it,” Yang Kai said with a self-deprecating smile. “Let’s go back.”

Turning around, just before stepping into the mansion, his expression suddenly darkened. He reached out to the side.

His hand seemed to stretch invisibly, a force like a rope shot forth unseen to the naked eye.

A delicate cry rang out, and Qiu Yimeng was taken aback. She turned toward the sound and frowned slightly.

Some ten or so zhang away, a person clad in black robes floated midair, struggling desperately. An invisible giant hand appeared to grasp her neck, and no matter how wildly she kicked, she could not escape Yang Kai’s grasp.

“Huh?” Qiu Yimeng was surprised. The startled cry sounded somewhat familiar, but she could not see the person’s face and was curious.

Yang Kai let out a cold snort and waved his hand, sending out a surge of energy that blew away the bamboo hat covering the captive’s face, revealing her true features.

Upon seeing her, Yang Kai's eyes narrowed, a sharp chill flashing through his gaze.

Qiu Yimeng, however, remained calm, watching the person struggle with leisure and a soft giggle. “So it’s you?”

“Still won’t let go?” The woman bit her blood-red lips, ignoring Qiu Yimeng’s teasing, and glared sharply at Yang Kai. Her face flushed deep red, her chest heaving violently, radiating waves of irresistible allure.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, not wanting to be too harsh. He had only reacted because he noticed someone approaching him too quickly without announcing themselves.

With a casual flick, he released the woman, who gasped and fell backward awkwardly. When she stood back up, her gaze was full of hidden resentment.

She had never been treated this way before.

“Miss Ye,” Qiu Yimeng said gracefully, standing next to Yang Kai with a radiant poise, casting a mischievous glance at Ye Xinrou. “Why aren’t you staying at Yang Zhao’s mansion to attend to the Second Young Master? What are you doing here?”

Catching the implication in her words, Ye Xinrou’s heart darkened in secret resentment but showed no trace on her face. She only smiled lightly, coquettishly. “Sister Qiu, how could I be serving him? I’m just an ally of the Second Young Master; serving him is a matter for the mansion's servants. I have no need to interfere.”

“Oh?” Qiu Yimeng feigned surprise. “Yet I heard that ever since you allied with the Second Young Master, your relationship has only grown closer, almost to the point of marriage negotiations.”

Ye Xinrou giggled coyly, covering her mouth. “Sister, you must have heard wrong. I’m not the type to just marry myself off. Though, Sister, you’re not exactly young anymore—maybe you should consider settling down. If you want, I could put in a good word for you with the Second Young Master. He’s been rather down lately, and hearing that might cheer him up.”

“No need,” Qiu Yimeng smiled faintly, turning to look at Yang Kai. “If I were to marry, I’ve already got someone in mind.”

Ye Xinrou was stunned, never expecting Qiu Yimeng to be so bold as to openly confess in front of Yang Kai. After a moment, she looked admiringly at her. “You really are extraordinary. I wouldn’t dare say such things myself—I’m far too shy.”

Qiu Yimeng’s expression softened, and the two young women’s eyes met, sparking an invisible fire.

At the mansion’s entrance stood two guards of unknown origin. Hearing the two girls call each other “sister” so warmly and speak so gently, they seemed closer than actual siblings. Yet for some reason, a cold sense of danger hovered over them, bringing sweat to their brows.

“Say what you need to say or piss off! I don’t have time to listen to you squabble here,” Yang Kai snapped, impatient. His thoughts were preoccupied with an unresolved matter, making him increasingly anxious.

“Is the young master really this cold?” Ye Xinrou said with slight dissatisfaction. “But since I came, it must be important.”

Yang Kai looked at her straightforwardly, giving no further response.

Ye Xinrou was taken aback. “You don’t mean for me to talk here, do you?”

“Why would that be inconvenient?”

“Of course it is.” Ye Xinrou looked frustrated. She had come here furtively; if someone deliberately spotted her meeting with Yang Kai, it would cause trouble for her.

After all, she was from Yang Zhao’s side.

Qiu Yimeng had obviously considered this and quietly whispered in Yang Kai’s ear.

She worried that if their meeting with Ye Xinrou became public, it might be exploited, harming not only Ye Xinrou but also Yang Kai’s reputation.

Though reluctant, Yang Kai finally said, “Then let’s go inside and talk.”

No sooner said, Ye Xinrou surrounded by a sweet fragrance swept into the mansion. Passing Yang Kai, she giggled coquettishly and gave a wildly seductive wink.

Yang Kai’s expression turned strange. This Ye Xinrou was nothing like what he had imagined.

“You thought she was an innocent girl?” Qiu Yimeng scoffed.

“I did,” Yang Kai nodded. Her name, appearance, and their previous encounters had made him think she was an enemy but still decent.

Now, it seemed he had been mistaken.

“Hmph, be careful. Don’t let her eat you to the bone,” Qiu Yimeng warned with a sour tone.

“Am I that kind of person?” Yang Kai glared at her coolly.

Qiu Yimeng couldn’t help but laugh—perhaps she had overthought it.

If Yang Kai were like Huo Xingchen, a filthy lecherous scoundrel, she might worry he’d succumb to Ye Xinrou’s temptations. But Yang Kai, despite being somewhat insufferable and flirtatious, was fundamentally a man of principles.

If she tried to seduce him, Yang Kai might be indiscriminately eager and devour her, but Ye Xinrou... she didn’t have that power.

Pride welled quietly in Qiu Yimeng’s heart.

Inside the mansion, outside the side hall, Qiu Yimeng paused and smiled. “You should talk to her yourself. I have some issues with her; if we meet, we’ll definitely quarrel. Better not to meet at all.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly, having experienced it firsthand; Qiu Yimeng’s words rang true.

Both young ladies came from the Zhongdu Eight Great Families, naturally inclined to compete—with Qiu Yimeng’s fame unquestionably dominant. Ye Xinrou was no match in reputation.

Inside the side hall, Ye Xinrou had removed her disguise, breathing heavily and relaxed. Clearly, she had carefully groomed herself. Already beautiful by nature, she now radiated a captivating glow.

Her snow-white arms were bare, skin pure and flawless like frost at dawn. Her bust was full but perfectly proportioned, her waist slender, hips round and firm, legs long and graceful.

At her ankles jingled delicate bell-like ornaments that, though silent, added a charming touch.

She gave the impression of a delicate, obedient beauty—the kind who clings like a little bird.

Yet Yang Kai now saw the subtle seduction lurking in her clear eyes.

“What do you want to say?” Yang Kai’s face wore impatience.

“You really are cold, young master,” Ye Xinrou smiled coquettishly.

“You’re wrong,” Yang Kai smirked. “I’m not cold. I’m quite interested in beauties. But I have matters to attend to now and don’t want to waste time.”

“Are you complimenting me a beauty?” Ye Xinrou’s face lit with a rosy glow, her teeth gently biting her lip.

“To each their own,” Yang Kai nodded. “In my eyes, you’re beautiful. But even if you are, I can’t waste my time.”

“Then I’ll be straightforward.” Ye Xinrou made no further attempt to coax him. She knew his nature well enough—strong-willed people hate being led by the nose and waste time with evasions.

Yang Kai adopted a “listening” pose.

“Seven days ago, in that battle, the Second Young Master lost all fighting spirit. Though I’m his ally and should be the one to support him and restore his confidence, no matter how hard I try, it’s no use. Simply put, the Second Young Master is doomed to be eliminated from the succession battle.”

“What do you mean?” Yang Kai smiled with intrigue, lips curling. “Don’t tell me you intend to betray my Second Brother and come over to my side?”
