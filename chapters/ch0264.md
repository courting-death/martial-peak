## Chapter 264 — Woman, Be Careful Not to Burn Yourself

After a long time, Zi Mo let out a soft sigh, turned around, and left.

Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, gazing in the direction she had vanished, a faint smile gracing his lips.

"Young Master, that girl just now had the intention to kill you, but she seemed to hesitate for some reason and ultimately gave up!" Di Mo reminded him. He had been vigilant about Zi Mo's movements and had naturally observed her demeanor clearly.

"I know, she made a wise choice." Yang Kai nodded slightly and continued to close his eyes in contemplation.

Half a day later, Zi Mo returned, bringing back a considerable amount of dead wood and a piece of game.

As she lit a bonfire to roast the prey, Zi Mo sat beside it, warming herself while waiting for Yang Kai to awaken.

Three days later.

Just as Zi Mo was gritting her teeth and cursing Yang Kai, a faint sword intent suddenly emanated from not far away. Her delicate face immediately changed color, and she stood up alertly, looking in the direction from which the sword intent originated.

Soon, her expression turned to one of astonishment.

Because this sword intent was actually coming from the pit where Yang Kai was healing.

This sword intent felt very familiar; it was the same sword intent that had surged forth when Wu Chengyi unleashed that astonishing sword move a few days prior. Yet now, it was reappearing on Yang Kai.

Zi Mo looked on suspiciously, her brows tightly knitted.

Gradually, the sword intent grew stronger, increasing at a remarkable speed. In just the time it takes to brew a cup of tea, it reached a level that left Zi Mo's complexion pale.

It was as if the deceased Wu Chengyi had come back to life, ready to unleash that breathtaking sword strike once more!

Boom…

The pit where Yang Kai was hiding suddenly exploded, dust flying everywhere as a figure shot out, trailing a streak of crimson light.

Zi Mo gasped, hurriedly retreating, her eyes wide with surprise as she looked over. She saw Yang Kai standing still, eyes closed, holding that crimson long sword treasure, motionless in place.

His True Yuan surged and ebbed, indomitable, as if he were surrounded by countless sharp swords.

Clang…

The crimson long sword emitted a clear ringing sound. With this sound, Yang Kai's True Yuan seemed to be ignited, and in an instant, several hundred sword energies appeared around him.

Another several hundred…

Moments later, the entire world transformed once again into a realm of swords.

Just like the scene witnessed a few days ago, it was breathtaking.

Zi Mo covered her mouth, utterly astonished.

Wu Chengyi had said that this move was the unpassed secret of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect. How could Yang Kai also execute it?

Moreover, the sword energies he manifested were even more numerous than Wu Chengyi's. On that day, Wu Chengyi had exhausted all his True Yuan to produce just over two thousand sword energies, but at this moment, Yang Kai had conjured over three thousand.

Over three thousand was Yang Kai's limit. His expression turned strained.

With a tremor of the long sword, the three thousand sword energies instantly fused together, and in the blink of an eye, only about a hundred remained.

With the sword edge pointing, these sword energies, imbued with immense destructive power, shot forth in a single direction.

Boom boom boom…

The ground over there was instantly riddled with holes, shattered to pieces!

Yang Kai closed his eyes, feeling the weight of the moment, his expression grave.

The unpassed secret of the Jiu Xing Sword Sect, a profound-level sword technique, truly possessed immense power!

This move was not inferior to the instantaneous explosion of Star Mark. However, similarly, it consumed a great deal of True Yuan. No wonder Wu Chengyi had appeared utterly exhausted after using it.

Yet, Ten Thousand Swords Return to One had many advantages over Star Mark.

This move was composed of two parts: one part transformed True Yuan into sword energies, which could also be used for attack, while the other part involved merging these sword energies. When mastered to perfection, it could culminate in a world-destroying sword strike!

Wu Chengyi had not mastered it to perfection, nor had Yang Kai.

However, being able to learn this sword technique, Yang Kai was already quite satisfied. At least in the future, when he wielded the Shura Sword, he would not be limited to mere hacking; he would have a technique he could showcase.

The True Yuan that had only recently been born within him fused and gathered once more in this moment of comprehension, becoming as sharp as a sword edge, rapidly flowing through his meridians, creating a humming sound. Yang Kai's expression remained serious, utterly still.

Half an hour later, an invisible aura suddenly burst forth, and Yang Kai's body shook as he opened his eyes.

True Yuan Realm, Second Stage!

By comprehending this profound-level martial technique, his strength had risen to a new level.

Smiling slightly, he stowed away the Shura Sword.

Footsteps approached from behind, and Yang Kai turned to see Zi Mo walking toward him with a strange expression.

Stopping about ten zhang away, although her face was charmingly smiling, there was an undeniable hint of vigilance and wariness in her eyes. Just moments ago, she had sensed Yang Kai's miraculous breakthrough; how could she not feel it?

This breakthrough was too bizarre, with no signs whatsoever, leaving Zi Mo both envious and admiring.

After a long silence, Zi Mo finally spoke, "Since you are awake, I will take my leave."

She did not inquire why Yang Kai understood Wu Chengyi's sword technique; the more she knew, the more it would harm her. Zi Mo was a clever woman and naturally understood when to keep her eyes open and when to close them.

"Where are you going?" Yang Kai tilted his head, smiling as he asked.

Zi Mo was taken aback, then lightly laughed, her voice soft and gentle, "Where else would I go? Of course, I’m returning to Tianlang."

As she spoke, she covered her mouth and cast a flirtatious glance, "What? Can't I go home?"

"Don't go back." Yang Kai smiled lightly, a hint of unarguable authority in his tone, "From now on, follow me."

Zi Mo was stunned, bursting into laughter, "What do you want me to follow you for? I am still a member of Tianlang. If I return to your sect, I will be looked down upon everywhere; I won't do that."

"You wear so little; you look no different from the women of the Great Han. Hmm, I lack a maid to serve me, so come back and make tea, warm my bed, and fold my blankets." Yang Kai said with a serious expression.

Zi Mo's expression slightly changed, and she forced a smile, "Are you serious?"

"What do you think?"

Zi Mo finally couldn't take it anymore, her smile gradually fading, her eyes filled with coldness and endless grievance. Frowning and stamping her foot, she said, "Are you even reasonable? I stayed here for three days out of kindness, taking care of you, and now you want me to be your maid? If I had known this, I would have killed you while you were healing…"

Realizing she had let something slip, Zi Mo quickly covered her mouth, nervously observing Yang Kai's reaction, forcing a smile, "I was just thinking, I didn't really mean to act. Don't be angry…"

"Haha!" Yang Kai burst into hearty laughter.

Zi Mo grew increasingly uneasy, lightly biting her red lips, her brows furrowed. She simply could not see through Yang Kai's thoughts.

"I was just joking." Yang Kai smiled, "Why are you taking it so seriously?"

"Joking?" Zi Mo's pretty face turned colder, gritting her teeth as she questioned.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded, "I won't take you back."

"You have a woman already?" Zi Mo's eyes brightened.

Yang Kai chuckled awkwardly.

Upon hearing this, Zi Mo couldn't help but snort coldly. Clearly recalling Yang Kai's audacity toward her in a different realm, her heart filled with anger, emboldening her. She stepped forward, her hips swaying, directly walking up to Yang Kai, pressing her ample chest against him.

"I've changed my mind; I want to go back with you." Zi Mo tilted her smooth chin slightly, provocatively gazing at Yang Kai, "I want to see what kind of woman can make a shameless man like you so infatuated."

Yang Kai chuckled, his interest piqued as he glanced at her.

"Are you scared?" Zi Mo sneered.

"Woman, be careful not to play with fire!" Yang Kai's lips curled into a wicked grin.

Zi Mo's complexion changed dramatically. Suddenly recalling everything that had happened in the other realm, she hurriedly distanced herself from Yang Kai, as if avoiding a snake or scorpion, her heart filled with hatred as she gritted her teeth, her chest rising and falling.

She truly did not have the qualifications to challenge him. If he were to unleash his wolfish nature in this desolate wilderness…

"I'm leaving. I pray I never see you again in my life, and I pray your woman dumps you, leaving you to live a lonely life!" Zi Mo cursed venomously.

"Wait!" Yang Kai frowned.

"What else do you want?" Zi Mo's heart skipped a beat; she did not wish to stay with Yang Kai for even a moment longer.

Just as she was on guard, she saw Yang Kai take out several bottles from his pants pocket. Then, he poured a drop of liquid from two of the bottles and casually tossed them over.

Zi Mo caught them, her expression filled with suspicion as she asked, "What is this?"

"A drop of Liuyan Liquid, and a drop of Soul Cleansing Dew!"

Zi Mo's expression changed, looking at Yang Kai in astonishment, and soon a mix of surprise and joy appeared on her face.

Seemingly in disbelief, she even specially uncapped the bottles to sniff.

"For me?" After confirming that these two items were indeed Liuyan Liquid and Soul Cleansing Dew, Zi Mo cradled them in her arms like treasures, gripping them tightly.

Yang Kai nodded, "Consider it a reward for bullying you during this time."

A blush crept onto Zi Mo's delicate face as she stared at Yang Kai in a daze. After a long while, she softly said, "Actually, you’re not such a bad person…"

"Are you moved? If you want to come with me now, it's not too late." Yang Kai grinned widely.

"Get lost!" Zi Mo scolded playfully, her expression suddenly becoming serious, "Don't worry, I will use them secretly and won’t expose you. If you come to Tianlang in the future, just come to Senluo Palace to find me; I will treat you well… hee hee…"

The last sentence was said through gritted teeth.

"Stinky man, take care!" Zi Mo laughed lightly, her body lightly leaping back, swiftly disappearing from sight.

At last, she had freed herself from Yang Kai's control! Zi Mo felt as if a heavy stone had been lifted from her heart.

Although the imprint still lingered in her mind, with Yang Kai in the Great Han and her in Tianlang, what was there to fear? Once she returned to her sect, she would ask her master if there was a way to remove the imprint in her mind.

Watching Zi Mo vanish in the distance, Yang Kai smiled slightly and turned to leave like a shooting star.

Passing by the place where he had battled Wu Chengyi a few days prior, he found that Wu Chengyi's corpse had already disappeared, and there was a freshly dug mound nearby, likely the result of Zi Mo's handling of the aftermath.

This woman was indeed quite clever.

A day later, Yang Kai arrived at a nearby small town, spending money to hire a carriage. He informed the driver of the destination and then hid in the carriage, entering seclusion to consolidate his True Yuan Realm's Second Stage.
