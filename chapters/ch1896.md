## Chapter 1896 — Could It Really Be Like This

"Brother Yang…" Xue Yue suddenly hissed in the hall.

Yang Kai's eye twitched violently; he felt a bad premonition, but he could only smile and clasp his fists: "Third Young Master, long time no see!"

"Thanks to fortune!" Xue Yue replied coldly.

For some reason, upon hearing their exchange, Shen Tu shivered; instinct told him there was likely some serious grudge between the two.

He glanced at Xue Yue, then at Yang Kai, cleared his throat and prepared to play peacemaker, but before he could speak Xue Yue gave him an icy look: "You go out. I have some things to discuss with Brother Yang!"

She stressed the words "Brother Yang."

Shen Tu swallowed hard, a war between conscience and self-preservation raging inside him — on one hand, loyalty demanded he help a friend in need; on the other, his life was important and as long as the green hills remained, there would be firewood.

He hesitated only two breaths before adopting a solemn tone: "Very well, then Second Brother will wait outside. You two… take your time, take your time!"

Saying that, his feet moved swiftly and he strode out, casting frantic glances back at the distraught Chun Yi and Li Nuo who remained inside.

The two women understood at once, shot Yang Kai a long look, then followed Shen Tu.

Click…

The main door of the hall closed.

Shen Tu, Chun Yi and Li Nuo halted abruptly, turned to the side and strained their ears to listen.

Inside there was not the slightest sound — neither struggle nor quarrel, it was unnervingly quiet.

After a long moment, Shen Tu could no longer hold back. With a worried look he said, "Third Brother wouldn't be so foolish as to overestimate himself. But if he's thinking of tangling with Brother Yang—Brother Yang is at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm. If Third Brother were injured, how would Father ever answer for it?"

"Where is your mind wandering, Second Young Master?" Li Nuo glanced at Shen Tu and pursed her lips with a smile. "I don't think they're about to fight."

"Not about to fight?" Shen Tu was stunned. "Didn't you just see how murderous Third Brother looked? His temper is always terrible. He only behaves politely and cultured in front of outsiders. Only I know what kind of demon he hides inside. I think his grudge with Brother Yang is not small…"

"Grudges and vendettas, grudges and vendettas… maybe it's not a grudge, but…" Li Nuo suddenly felt inexplicably exhilarated; even her cheeks flushed faintly.

"Not a grudge!" Shen Tu frowned, then realization dawned: "Then it must be a love vendetta! Good heavens, is Third Brother fighting Brother Yang over a woman? Which woman is so blessed to be coveted by both of them?"

Li Nuo put a hand to her forehead and said softly, "Not some random woman — didn't you notice the way the Third Young Master was looking at that Lord Yang?"

"What's wrong with the look in his eyes?" Shen Tu looked innocently puzzled.

Li Nuo immediately covered her face with both hands, as if unable to explain.

Shen Tu snapped, "Say it clearly if you have something to say!"

Chun Yi coughed lightly, her cheeks slightly flushed, and reminded, "Second Young Master, think carefully — the Third Young Master is such a dragon among men; in all these years has he ever shown interest in any woman?"

"No, he hasn't." Shen Tu thought for a moment. "I do admire that about Third Brother; in matters of personal conduct he is beyond reproach. But… what does that have to do with today's affair?"

"Second Young Master, have you ever heard other… rumors about the Third Young Master?"

"There are plenty of rumors about him!" Shen Tu snorted. "Given his status and talent, how could there be no rumors? Some say he's the reincarnation of a Martial God; others say he's actually a woman; some extravagantly claim he dislikes women and prefers men — hahahaha… I couldn't believe such nonsense, it's all tavern talk and hearsay."

Chun Yi and Li Nuo looked at him silently.

Shen Tu's laughter abruptly died; his expression turned grave as he murmured, "Third Brother has grown up without ever showing affection for any woman, and none of the elders in the Commerce Guild who introduced their daughters to him ever won his favor, not even those of peerless beauty… and the way he just looked at Brother Yang…"

Chun Yi and Li Nuo nodded together, thinking "Praise be, you finally caught on".

"It can't really be like that, can it?" Shen Tu broke out in a cold sweat.

"I hope not!" Chun Yi said solemnly.

If things were truly as they imagined, how many maidens in the entire Hengluo Commerce Guild would be broken-hearted, how many married women would be torn apart — it would be an unimaginable human calamity.

In the hall, Xue Yue and Yang Kai stared at each other for a long time before she ground her teeth and hissed, "You bastard!"

As she spoke, she swung her fist at Yang Kai.

But when her fist landed on Yang Kai it became limp and powerless.

Yang Kai stood where he was and forced a dry laugh, letting her dainty fists pummel him a few times; not even his clothes creased.

Xue Yue lifted her head and glared at him stubbornly, biting her thin lip.

Yang Kai reached out and embraced her.

Xue Yue made a few perfunctory struggles to feign modesty, then, her cheeks faintly flushed, yielded and rested her head against Yang Kai's broad chest.

Her hair brushed Yang Kai's nose; a natural maidenly fragrance emanated from it that smelled pleasant, and Yang Kai could not help but take a few gentle sniffs.

"Since you have come here, why didn't you see me right away?" Xue Yue complained softly.

"I planned to come find you in a few days. I didn't expect Shen Tu couldn't handle the matter I asked him to, so it was delayed."

"Useless Second Brother!" Xue Yue snorted and immediately pinned all the blame on Shen Tu.

"Tell me, when did you last go out, and how did you get rid of Zi Long?" Xue Yue looked up at Yang Kai earnestly, wanting to know everything that had happened to him.

Her red lips trembled, extremely enticing.

Yang Kai couldn't resist and gave her a light peck.

Xue Yue instantly turned crimson; a strange glow appeared at her throat.

Last time in the Lost Realm she and Yang Kai had had some intimate contact, but that had been under the threat of death — Xue Yue had thought she was certain to die and so had let go of everything; this time was different.

Especially knowing that her Second Brother was eavesdropping outside, the situation added both tension and excitement.

Flustered, she hurriedly pushed Yang Kai away and escaped from his embrace.

Yang Kai laughed heartily and casually took a chair to sit.

Seeing his nonchalance, Xue Yue stamped her foot in annoyance; the spoiled-girl manner was plain to see.

She came over in a huff, sat beside Yang Kai, dutifully poured a cup of tea, then picked up a grape-like spirit fruit from the platter, peeled it, and pressed a piece into Yang Kai's mouth.

"Tell me, how did you escape last time? Zi Long didn't bother you much, did he? Has the secret of the Everlasting Tree on you been revealed?"

Xue Yue looked concerned and peppered him with questions, then added, "Don't worry, I've already informed Uncle Ni to keep quiet about your having the Everlasting Tree."

"I trust your word," Yang Kai nodded lightly.

But Xue Yue heard an undertone — she trusted Yang Kai, but as for Ni Guang… that remained to be seen.

After all, Ni Guang belonged to the Hengluo Commerce Guild. Yang Kai bearing the secret of the Everlasting Tree was not something Xue Yue could stop with a single word; even if Ni Guang told others, it would likely be only a very few.

Everyone wanted good things to themselves; if the whole world knew, no one would benefit.

Yang Kai then recounted what had happened after he left the Floating Continent.

When Xue Yue learned Zi Long and Zi Donglai had both been killed by Yang Kai, she cried out in astonishment.

Only then did she think to probe Yang Kai's cultivation — she herself was only Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, so in theory she couldn't have sensed Yang Kai's depth, but since Yang Kai did not block her Divine Sense, she could sense him.

"You're already Second Stage of the Void King Realm!" Xue Yue was astounded.

When they had been in the Lost Realm they had both been Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; only a few years had passed, and this man before her had reached Second Stage of the Void King Realm!

While she still lingered at Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

A sudden sense of crisis rose in Xue Yue, and she longed to retreat and break through at once.

But she was no child; having handled Hengluo Commerce Guild affairs for Ai Ou for many years, her temperament was hardened and mature. Taking a deep breath, she calmed herself and said happily, "As you said, Zi Long is dead and Zi Donglai went with him; doesn't that mean Purple Star is now leaderless?"

"Yes — not only leaderless, but also grievously wounded."

"Why do you say that?" Xue Yue regarded Yang Kai with a strange expression. Zi Long's death was a huge blow to Purple Star, but not to the extent of being grievously wounded, so she immediately realized other things must have happened on Purple Star.

"Nothing much, I caused a little trouble on Purple Star not long ago and seriously injured their Great Elder Gongsun Liang. Their internal strife coincided and many of their experts fell!"

"That too?" Xue Yue exclaimed. "Tell me everything in detail."

Yang Kai grinned and signaled Xue Yue with his eyes.

Xue Yue coyly shot him a look, continued peeling the spirit fruit, and fed him the flesh.

Yang Kai then leisurely told her what had happened on Purple Star.

After hearing it, Xue Yue couldn't help but laugh: "Now you probably have every person on Purple Star hating you to death. A figure like Kuang Shizong couldn't do anything to you, and you even destroyed a Void King-Grade warship; he's probably still in pain over that."

"He insisted on exterminating us; no blame to be placed on anyone else," Yang Kai smiled slightly.

"But after such a huge matter, Second Brother didn't even report it to Father? That's really unacceptable. No wonder Purple Star has been riding low recently and even pulled some of their businesses back — so that's the reason." Xue Yue's face lit up with sudden comprehension; what had once confused her now snapped into place.
