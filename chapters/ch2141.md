## Chapter 2141 — Courting Death

Hua Qingsi made no further moves, and Yang Kai did not retaliate either, simply standing there and waiting.

After a while, Hua Qingsi finally let out a faint sigh and looked up at Yang Kai.

She still had trump cards left, and her ultimate moves had yet to be revealed. Her earlier probing and attacks had only displayed half her true strength.

But she also understood in her heart that Yang Kai likewise had not shown his full power.

Even if she could exhaust all her means to defeat this man in his normal state, how could she possibly overcome him in his demonic form?

The scene of being subdued by this Demonic Master with a single move last time was still vivid in her mind. Every time she recalled it, Hua Qingsi shuddered uncontrollably. That was absolute power crushing her, leaving no room for resistance...

So, Hua Qingsi did not wish to keep testing him. With his current cultivation at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, being able to handle her attacks so effortlessly was proof enough of his strength and heaven-defying talent.

Moreover... this man actually understood Spatial Force! And he possessed an Imperial Treasure like the Xuan Realm Pearl!

"Have you accepted your fate?" Yang Kai smiled faintly, reading something from her expression.

Hua Qingsi pressed her red lips together, saying nothing.

"Don’t show such a pitiful expression, it makes me feel sorry for you!" Yang Kai chuckled. "Don’t worry, in a few years you’ll realize how wise today’s choice was! If you miss this opportunity, even if you beg to join me in the future, I won’t take you in."

"You really are shameless, that’s one thing you excel at!" Hua Qingsi mocked.

"Just wait and see." Yang Kai smiled. "Alright, let’s not waste time. I have things to do. Be good and offer up your Soul Brand!"

Hua Qingsi sighed again, sat down cross-legged, closed her beautiful eyes, and began circulating her profound arts.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s expression grew serious. He drifted down, standing not far in front of her.

After a short while, Hua Qingsi’s body suddenly trembled, her features twisting in pain as if she were enduring immense agony.

A surge of pure soul power suddenly burst from her Sea of Consciousness, shooting straight toward Yang Kai.

Sensing this, Yang Kai quickly lowered the defenses of his own Sea of Consciousness, accepting the force of her Divine Sense.

Closing his eyes, his Spirit Body manifested within the Sea of Consciousness. Soon, Yang Kai discovered a new, unfamiliar soul force inside, coiling together to form the shape of a brand, quietly floating in midair.

Within the brand was Hua Qingsi’s soul aura!

Yang Kai’s Spirit Body formed seals with both hands, changing constantly. As he moved, the Sea of Consciousness churned, gathering into a towering wave that split open like a giant maw, swallowing the brand whole like a fierce beast.

At the bottom of the canyon, Hua Qingsi suddenly shivered.

She slowly opened her beautiful eyes, only to find Yang Kai smiling at her. Instantly, she snapped, "What are you looking at!"

Yang Kai said, "You’ve got quite the temper."

"Hmph!" Hua Qingsi snorted in displeasure, awkwardly saying, "It feels weird."

This was the first time she had ever offered her Soul Brand to someone else. Although it didn’t affect her directly, she still felt a subtle discomfort deep down.

It was as if something precious had been taken from her.

"You’ll get used to it," Yang Kai said. "Now that we’re on the same side, we’re not outsiders anymore. I hope we can get along well!"

"Don’t think saying that will make me like you. I’m only here because you forced me," Hua Qingsi replied coldly.

"Think whatever you want," Yang Kai shrugged.

"I wanted to ask earlier..." Hua Qingsi changed the subject, glancing around. "Where is this place? Why is there a Sea of Spiritual Qi?"

"So you do know about the Seas of Spiritual Qi," Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"There aren’t many, but there are a few in the Star Realm. My Star God Palace has one," Hua Qingsi said disdainfully, giving Yang Kai a look.

"This is the Four Seasons Land!" Yang Kai replied.

Hua Qingsi was stunned, then cried out, "What? You said this is the Four Seasons Land?"

"That’s right!"

Hua Qingsi’s brows furrowed, but soon she seemed to recall something and muttered to herself, "That’s it, by the timing, the Four Seasons Land should be opening! But... how did you qualify to enter? I remember Fenglin City didn’t have any spots."

"By chance, I came in with people from Qingyang Shrine," Yang Kai answered.

"Why would people from Qingyang Shrine bring you in?" Hua Qingsi was even more puzzled. "Every spot to enter is extremely precious..."

"It’s a long story. Anyway, I snatched one of their spots," Yang Kai waved his hand.

"Snatched..." Hua Qingsi’s expression was quite something.

As they spoke, a fork in the path appeared ahead. Yang Kai stopped and said, "Let’s split up. In places like this, the chance of finding heaven-and-earth treasures is high. It’d be a shame to miss out."

"Let me be clear, if I find something good..." Hua Qingsi’s adaptability was impressive. After her initial gloom, she was now bargaining with Yang Kai.

"It’s yours, I won’t take it," Yang Kai replied readily.

"Just what I wanted to hear." Hua Qingsi smiled, then dashed down the left fork.

"Two days at most, then we regroup!" Yang Kai called after her, not knowing if she heard.

It didn’t really matter. Now that he controlled Hua Qingsi’s Soul Brand, as long as they weren’t too far apart Yang Kai could sense her location.

After she left, Yang Kai stepped into the right fork.

This place was already quite far from where Zhang Ruoxi was, but the Spiritual Qi still hung like mist. It was clear, though, that under the pull of the Xuan Realm Pearl the abundant Spiritual Qi was rapidly flowing in a certain direction, decreasing at a remarkable rate.

Places like the Sea of Spiritual Qi truly have a high chance of producing heaven-and-earth treasures.

Yang Kai had only just entered the right fork when he found a stalk of Earth Blood Ghost Orchid on the stone wall. Though this Spiritual Medicine was only Dao Origin-Grade Middle-Level, it was extremely rare. Despite its rarity, it could be used as a main ingredient for many Spiritual Pills, making it quite valuable—most importantly, it was something money couldn’t buy.

Yang Kai carefully picked it, placed it in a jade box, and planned to transplant it into the medicine garden of the Small Xuan Realm when he returned.

Only by doing so could he fully preserve the medicine’s properties, and even enhance its effects using the garden’s special qualities.

Over the next few hours, he made several gains in the canyon below. The abundant heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi here had given rise to rare Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines, making this place a treasure trove for an alchemist like Yang Kai.

After one round, he had obtained seven or eight different types and grades of medicinal materials—a modest harvest.

What disappointed him, though, was that he hadn’t found any Emperor-Grade Heaven and Earth treasures, only Dao Origin-Grade ones.

Although Dao Origin-Grade and Emperor-Grade medicinal materials were only one grade apart, their effects were worlds apart. Every Emperor-Grade herb contained Law Power. Whether consumed or refined into pills, they allowed martial artists to comprehend Law Power, which was invaluable to any cultivator.

The canyon seemed endless, stretching for an unknown number of li. Although Yang Kai moved slowly searching for treasures, after several hours he had covered at least several hundred li but still saw no end.

Just as he was about to continue exploring deeper, he suddenly felt a sense of unease.

He frowned, glanced back the way he came, and in the next moment, his expression changed as he shouted, "Courting death!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he summoned his wooden boat, stepped aboard, and sped back the way he came.

Meanwhile, elsewhere in the canyon, Zhang Ruoxi sat cross-legged on the ground, with heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi constantly pouring into her body. Her aura was rapidly rising. Originally only at the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, she had quickly advanced to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and showed no signs of stopping, soon approaching the threshold of the Origin Returning Realm.

Not far from her, Liu Yan held the Xuan Realm Pearl, her face cold as she stared ahead.

A dozen zhang away stood three men. Their appearances aside, their clothing was very similar. Anyone familiar with Southern Territory sects could tell from the emblem on their chests that these three were from a sect called Evil Moon Valley.

Evil Moon Valley’s power was about the same as Biyu Sect’s, so when the Four Seasons Land opened this time, they also received three spots to enter.

After being brought into the Four Seasons Land, the three found themselves near the canyon.

Of the three, one was older and the other two middle-aged. The older man was at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, and the two middle-aged men were both at the Second Stage.

They hadn’t planned to explore the canyon; from above it looked pitch black and who knew what deadly dangers lurked within. Though not weak, compared to disciples from major sects they were much weaker.

They were well aware of their limits and didn’t dare take risks lightly.

What they hadn’t expected was that an unusual energy fluctuation would come from below the canyon.

As the Xuan Realm Pearl absorbed the heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi from the Sea of Spiritual Qi, the commotion was quite obvious.

Curiosity got the better of them and they flew down into the canyon to see for themselves. After all, opportunities are unpredictable—this trip might bring them great fortune and make them famous.

But when they discovered there were two women below, the three men were stunned.

Liu Yan was understandable; though she didn’t seem like a flesh-and-blood being, she at least appeared to be at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, which made sense for entering the Four Seasons Land.

The other little girl was simply outrageous.

A mere martial artist at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm had appeared in the Four Seasons Land. If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, the three men would have thought it was a dream.

Moreover... judging by the little girl’s appearance, she seemed to be using the dense heaven-and-earth Spiritual Qi here to cultivate and break through.

What was going on? The three men were completely baffled.
