## Chapter 2388 — Division

Several miserable screams rang out as the two martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion were killed instantly. Yu Leping’s situation was not much better; shrouded by Shen Fei’s sword curtain, no matter how hard he struggled, he could not break free, and the wounds on his body kept increasing.

Suddenly, a figure flashed by—Yang Kai appeared behind him in a flash and threw a punch at his back.

Yu Leping was already struggling to cope, so how could he guard against Yang Kai’s sneak attack? The punch landed squarely on his back, and a surge of powerful force erupted. Yu Leping spat out a mouthful of blood as the tremendous impact sent him stumbling forward several steps.

Shen Fei rushed in with his sword, and with a sweep of sword light, he sent Yu Leping’s head flying. Blood spurted from the headless corpse like a fountain.

In the next instant, Shen Fei suddenly reached out to grab Yu Leping’s Spatial Ring.

Earlier, Yu Leping had said he would give Yang Kai a million Source Crystals, which showed just how wealthy he was. Now that he was dead, his Spatial Ring naturally became a coveted prize.

But before Shen Fei could succeed, Yang Kai suddenly shouted, “Brother Shen, what are you doing?”

As soon as he finished speaking, he threw a punch at Shen Fei with tremendous force. Shen Fei frowned, not wanting to tangle with Yang Kai, so he shifted his body slightly to dodge the blow, but his hand still reached for the Spatial Ring.

Just then, a whistling sound suddenly came, and a jade-green shadow instantly wrapped itself around Yu Leping’s wrist.

As Shen Fei’s large hand reached out, the green shadow shot toward him like an arrow, baring its fangs with a hissing sound. Only then did Shen Fei see clearly—it was a venomous snake as thin as a bamboo skewer.

Startled, he immediately withdrew his hand, afraid of being bitten.

The green snake was extremely agile. Seeing Shen Fei withdraw, it did not pursue but instead coiled around Yu Leping’s finger, snatching away the Spatial Ring, then straightened its body and sprang toward Snake Lady.

Yang Kai and Shen Fei slowly landed, both staring darkly at Snake Lady. The two of them had been like the snipe and the clam—only for the Snake Lady to reap the fisherman's reward. Naturally, neither was in a good mood.

Man Kuai seemed a step slow to react. Only now did he come to his senses, eyeing the ring in Snake Lady’s hand hungrily.

“Big brothers… why are you staring at me like you want to eat me? I’m so scared,” Snake Lady said, quietly tucking the Spatial Ring into her bosom.

Shen Fei leveled his sword and pointed it at Snake Lady from afar. “If you try anything, don’t blame me for being rude.”

“What’s this about!” Snake Lady’s face stiffened, but she didn’t dare continue. She held the Spatial Ring in her delicate hand and forced a laugh.

“You know exactly what,” Shen Fei snorted, then turned to Man Kuai. “Brother Man, there might be a million Source Crystals in that ring. What do you think?”

Man Kuai grinned. “Ill-gotten gains should be split evenly between us, of course.”

Yang Kai looked at Shen Fei in surprise and complained, “Why aren’t you asking me?”

Shen Fei replied, “A mere million Source Crystals—would Brother Yang even care?” Clearly, he was mocking what Yang Kai had said to Yu Leping earlier.

“I do care! I’m very poor!” Yang Kai said with a straight face. Even though he really didn’t care about a million Source Crystals, he couldn’t show it here, or the others would become suspicious.

If he showed no interest in a million Source Crystals right in front of him, anyone would start to wonder.

Yang Kai called out, “I want a share too! Don’t be unfair!”

Shen Fei frowned, knowing he couldn’t shake Yang Kai off. Their earlier exchange had shown him that Yang Kai’s strength was not inferior to his own. He could only say, “Snake Lady, do you really want to go against the three of us alone? If you know what’s good for you, you should know what to do!”

Snake Lady gritted her teeth, looking resentful, but seeing the three burly men eyeing her like tigers, she knew she couldn’t keep Yu Leping’s Spatial Ring for herself. If she tried, she’d only incur everyone’s wrath. Though she was strong, she wasn’t confident she could handle both Shen Fei and Man Kuai at once.

Besides, she hadn’t yet tested how strong that brat Yang Kai really was.

“Take it!” Snake Lady, furious, threw the Spatial Ring at Shen Fei and pouted, “You’re all just bullies!”

She looked as if she was about to cry. Anyone who didn’t know the situation would surely feel sorry for her and hate Yang Kai and the others for ganging up on her.

This time, Yang Kai didn’t try to intercept the ring, letting Shen Fei catch it.

In the next moment, Shen Fei’s Divine Sense surged as he began breaking the ring’s restriction. Yang Kai and the others craned their necks, staring greedily.

Soon, Shen Fei’s face lit up with joy, and everyone knew he had succeeded.

“How much is there?” Man Kuai asked impatiently.

Shen Fei seemed a little excited himself. “See for yourselves.”

As he spoke, he waved his hand and set up a mid-grade Purification Array on the deck, then poured out everything from the ring.

In an instant, the deck was piled high. The mountain of Source Crystals nearly blinded Snake Lady and the others. No one knew the exact amount, but it was at least a million.

Yu Leping wasn’t joking when he said he had a million Source Crystals.

His cultivation was about the same as Snake Lady and the others, but he lived a carefree life, never running out of Source Crystals. In contrast, Snake Lady and the others had to work hard at sea just to scrape by.

Compared to this, Snake Lady and the others couldn’t help feeling a bit resentful. Their cultivation was on par with Yu Leping’s, yet while he lived a life of ease with more Source Crystals than he could ever spend, they had to risk their lives at sea just to scrape together enough resources to get by.

“How despicable! Just a minor steward in the City Lord’s mansion, and he’s already plundered so much from the people. He’s utterly heartless—heaven and earth should punish him!” Yang Kai cursed through gritted teeth.

His words struck a chord with Snake Lady and the others. Yu Leping really was just a minor steward in the City Lord’s mansion, yet he possessed such a fortune. What about those with higher status?

Surely, they had even more wealth than Yu Leping.

“Let’s split it up,” Man Kuai said excitedly, licking his lips.

“How many shares?” Snake Lady asked.

“Just the four of us. Who else?” Man Kuai replied matter-of-factly.

Shen Fei and Yang Kai exchanged a glance but said nothing.

“Then let’s get to it!” Snake Lady said decisively with a wave of her hand.

The four of them immediately divided up everything from Yu Leping’s ring. Each of them beamed with joy, as if they’d struck it rich.

Nearly twenty martial artists from the City Lord’s mansion had died this time. Besides Yu Leping’s ring, there were other spoils, but after searching, they found little of value. Except for the two other Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivators who had survived with Yu Leping, the rest had only a few hundred or even just a few dozen Source Crystals in their Spatial Rings—pitifully poor.

The two Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivators’ Spatial Rings had a few things, but their total value was less than a tenth of Yu Leping’s. Yang Kai and the others quickly split those as well.

About half a cup of tea later, a figure suddenly appeared over the sea, flying straight toward them and landing on the deck. It was Sangde, who had gone out in pursuit.

Judging by his appearance, he had clearly finished off the fleeing enemies.

“Master, what about that multi-deck ship?” Snake Lady asked, eyeing the ship moored nearby.

“If you want it, refine it yourself,” Sangde replied indifferently.

Snake Lady was overjoyed and was about to fly over when Sangde added, “Let’s keep moving!”

Snake Lady’s face darkened, but she didn’t dare argue with Sangde.

Soon, the multi-deck ship continued on its way.

To Snake Lady and the others’ surprise, Sangde didn’t ask about the spoils after returning, as if he’d forgotten. But that was just as they hoped—if Sangde had demanded a share, they wouldn’t have been able to refuse.

Yang Kai, however, knew that Sangde hadn’t forgotten—he just didn’t care!

This man had refined artifacts on Tongtian Island for nine hundred years and had reaped countless benefits. In terms of wealth, even ten Yu Lepings couldn’t compare to Sangde. Such paltry spoils were beneath his notice. Rather than cause trouble with Snake Lady and the others, he simply pretended not to know.

After the fierce battle, Snake Lady and the others seemed exhausted and went into the cabin to meditate and rest.

Yang Kai wasn’t tired, but he didn’t want to stand out, so he also went to his room to meditate.

Day after day passed. Sangde’s destination seemed extremely far from Tongtian Island. The multi-deck ship sailed for more than half a month without reaching its destination. During this time, everyone took turns resting and steering the ship, and things remained peaceful.

Occasionally, they encountered sea beasts, but there was never any real danger.

Sangde’s multi-deck ship was clearly of very high grade. Though not quite an Imperial Treasure, it was definitely at the peak of Dao Origin-Grade. Even when huge sea beasts rammed into it, the ship was unharmed.

No wonder—Sangde himself was a peak Dao Origin-Grade artificer. How could he not put his heart into refining his own Secret Treasure?

This multi-deck ship was not only incredibly sturdy, but also inscribed with numerous arrays and restrictive forces. For example, the force that had sealed Yu Leping and the others’ movements, as well as the barrier of light that had trapped them, were just a few of the ship’s many functions.

Yang Kai even suspected that Sangde had already refined the ship to the point where it was an extension of his will. On this ship, Sangde could control everything, and nothing could escape his senses.

If he wanted to deal with Snake Lady and the others on the ship, it would be a simple matter.

But as long as Sangde didn’t go mad, he surely wouldn’t do that. He still needed the others to help him retrieve that tool.

One day, while Yang Kai was meditating in his cabin, he suddenly felt the multi-deck ship shake violently and come to a rapid stop. He raised his eyebrows, realizing they must have arrived, and hurried out of his room.
