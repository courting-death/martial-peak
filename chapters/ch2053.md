## Chapter 2053 — Dao Origin Pill

In the blink of an eye, more than half a year had already passed.

The cavern had remained silent for over that time.

One day the blood cocoon that had enveloped Yang Kai suddenly emitted a series of cracking noises, like bones snapping—numerous, crisp, and sharp—then the cocoon slowly split open along a seam.

Immediately the fissures multiplied until the whole thing looked like a mirror shattered into pieces.

Finally, with a rustling roar, the cocoon burst apart into countless fragments that sprayed outward, and at the center stood Yang Kai’s towering form; his black hair flared though there was no wind, and his bare skin was white, tender, and delicate—even more flawless than a newborn’s.

Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes; a restrained divine light shone within them, and his spirit was vigorous.

He tilted his head, and his expression turned strange.

In that moment he felt something different, a peculiar sensation as if he had been granted new life.

He looked down to inspect his body, and his face showed astonishment.

Over the years he had traveled constantly, exposed to wind and sun; those hardships had forged his resolve and given him a sturdy physique, yet now, after a single pot of the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup, his skin had become even more delicate than a woman’s, which surprised him.

He rose and tried moving; his body felt lighter than before, and when he clenched his fist, boundless strength immediately surged forth from his flesh.

He casually swung his fist and a cracking blast sounded; a visible ripple ran through the air and quickly spread outward.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s face brightened; he instantly knew his body had undergone a significant enhancement. With a flicker of his Divine Sense he looked inward at his internal organs and was astonished to find them sculpted like gold and jade, overlaid with a faint golden sheen and giving off an impression of unbreakable solidity.

He had not been like this before.

Thinking it through, it had to be the work of that Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup—the broth seemed capable of unlocking a warrior’s bodily potential and tempering his physical constitution; coupled with his already powerful body, it had elevated his strength another notch.

More than that, Yang Kai could clearly feel that within his bones and flesh a large quantity of the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup’s potency had not been consumed; it remained stored there, quietly remolding his body as time passed.

He was very pleased by this result—no wonder the soup had been simmered for one to two thousand years; its effects were far more potent than taking any ordinary Spiritual Pill.

With the quality of his body now, he could refine a dragon Secret Treasure.

Thinking this, Yang Kai checked his strength.

That check immediately astonished him.

He discovered that the power within his body had, without his noticing, all been converted into Origin Qi; there was not the slightest trace of Saint Yuan left!

Origin Qi was a level above Saint Yuan, the very foundation by which Dao Origin Realm martial artists connected to the laws and marshaled Heaven-and-Earth Energy; without Origin Qi a martial artist could not possibly ascend to the Dao Origin Realm.

Yang Kai’s own comprehension of the Power of the Laws was already sufficient; the reason he had been unable to ascend was that his internal power had not yet been fully converted.

According to his plan, even continually taking the Origin Condensing Pill would have required at least another one to two years to convert all his power into Origin Qi, but now that requirement had been met ahead of schedule.

The credit naturally belonged to the Myriad Treasures Medicinal Soup.

This discovery made Yang Kai almost delirious with joy; now he could ascend to the Dao Origin Realm at any time.

Yet ascending to the Dao Origin Realm was an important matter, and this place was hardly suitable to receive the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy, so he did not intend to ascend here; he needed to find a proper location.

With that thought he prepared to leave.

He glanced around; there was nothing of note left in the cavern, and Liu Yan had still not returned since diving into that magma pool—no one knew what opportunities she might have found below.

Approaching the magma pool and observing, Yang Kai was startled to find its temperature much lower, as if some force had drawn away the heat.

He tried to communicate with Liu Yan, but received no response.

This did not make him worried but rather pleased; he knew Liu Yan must have encountered her own opportunity, which was why she could not sense his call.

With that in mind he ceased worrying over Liu Yan and began searching for an exit.

The cavern was small and connected to only one corridor; he soon found a teleportation formation at the far end, activated it, and immediately vanished from the cavern.

On some desolate ridge a hundred li from Primordial Cauldron Mountain, Yang Kai’s figure materialized.

He first released his Divine Sense to confirm there was no danger, then took in his surroundings; after a moment his form flashed and became a streak of light that shot off into the distance.

Yang Kai had no intention of returning to Fenglin City—his most pressing matter was to ascend to the Dao Origin Realm, so he needed to find a quiet, undisturbed place.

A few days later he descended onto a barren mountain, surveyed the area, and nodded slightly in satisfaction.

The place was desolate and the Spiritual Qi not particularly rich, but it was spacious and seldom visited.

He had no clan or Sect backing him; there would be no one to guard him at the moment of ascension, so he had to choose such a place.

Insufficient Spiritual Qi was not a fatal problem; he only needed to lay out some Source Crystals around to supplement the Spiritual Qi consumed in the ascension.

As a precaution he spent two days carefully searching a thousand-li radius, exterminating some demonic beasts that had settled there, and only then returned.

Ascending a Realm was vital for any martial artist; this was not like breaking through a Stage—if one failed, it could damage the Martial Dao foundation and leave a cultivator crippled, and in severe cases one could be killed by the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy.

He had to be careful.

Then he released the Yao Worm Matriarch and the Azure Flame Thunder Jackal blood beasts, ordering them to stand guard in different directions; with two blood beasts protecting the area, there should be no major problems.

After doing all that, he finally prepared himself with peace of mind.

He did not immediately attempt to force the Dao Origin Realm breakthrough; instead he casually took out the Ink Jade Cauldron and the jade slip left by Gongsun Mu, while carefully refining the Ink Jade Cauldron—imprinting his soul and life-mark into it—and studying the alchemical knowledge contained in the jade slip.

Long ago Yang Kai had tried stabilizing his mind through alchemy as preparation for a breakthrough; that method had repeatedly proven effective, so he did the same this time.

Time passed slowly, and Yang Kai seemed to forget his original purpose entirely, fully immersed in absorbing the world of alchemical knowledge.

The alchemical information on that jade slip might have been extremely abstruse to others, but for Yang Kai, who had once triggered the Great Dao Pill Tone and glimpsed a strand of Pill Dao truth, it was easily comprehensible.

Various pill formulas and the names of medicinal materials became clear to him within a month.

The Ink Jade Cauldron was finally successfully refined and became Yang Kai’s alchemy furnace in place of the Purple Void Cauldron.

One day Yang Kai placed the Ink Jade Cauldron before him and poured his Divine Sense Fire into it.

Suddenly a scorching breath issued from within the cauldron.

Moments later his fingers moved and one high-grade medicinal herb after another shot forth from his Spatial Ring, systematically placed into the Ink Jade Cauldron; under the searing Divine Sense Fire they gradually melted into medicinal liquids and condensed into a mass.

After a while more medicinal materials were added.

The cauldron’s fire rose and fell, and a faint fragrance of herbs intermittently drifted out.

Yang Kai's expression remained as calm as an ancient well, without the slightest trace of nervousness or impatience. His movements in adding the herbs were deliberate and unhurried, yet his control over the cauldron's heat was timed to the second, always hitting the perfect peak. One by one the spirit formations needed for pill refinement were inscribed by his Divine Sense Fire, manifesting and dissolving within the Ink Jade Cauldron and working their wonders with the medicinal liquid.

After six hours, with a flip of his wrist, a wooden box appeared in his palm.

Under the surging Origin Qi, the box opened on its own to reveal a spirit fruit the size of a longan.

It was the very Dao Origin Fruit the Zhang Family’s Head had given him.

In all the world there was only one type of Spiritual Pill that required a Dao Origin Fruit for its refining—the Dao Origin Pill—and it made all martial artists at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm intensely envious.

If those Void King Realm experts knew that Yang Kai, a Void King-Grade alchemist, was recklessly using a Dao Origin Fruit, they might very well seek to kill him. The Dao Origin Pill was no ordinary spiritual pill; the Dao Origin Fruit required as its chief ingredient grew only on a few trees within Tianwu Sacred Land, always kept for internal use and never sold—their value and rarity beyond imagining.

Which alchemist would dare refine a Dao Origin Fruit unless they were already Dao Origin-Grade? No Void King-Grade alchemist had ever treated such fruit lightly.

Yet Yang Kai did exactly that.

If he succeeded he would break through his alchemist bottleneck and rise to Dao Origin-Grade; if he failed the priceless Dao Origin Fruit would be reduced to charcoal.

After taking out the Dao Origin Fruit, Yang Kai’s previously indifferent expression grew solemn, but without hesitation he cast the fruit into the Ink Jade Cauldron.

He immediately closed the lid, his face grave, and his hands danced through the spirit formations like butterflies among flowers.

As the formations shifted, the liquid inside the Ink Jade Cauldron churned and made gurgling sounds.

Invisible spiritual arrays were born and died within the Ink Jade Cauldron in endless cycles.

Sweat gradually oozed from Yang Kai’s forehead; it seemed this alchemical refining was an extremely taxing affair for him.

This continued for a full ten hours; the prolonged mental concentration had drained Yang Kai greatly, his face growing slightly pale.

After ten hours he slowly withdrew his hand seals, drew a deep breath, and hastily retrieved several recovery Spiritual Pills from his Spatial Ring and swallowed them.

The cauldron still hummed; countless medicinal liquids fused and transformed within, undergoing wondrous changes.
