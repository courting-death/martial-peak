## Chapter 2330 — Weakness

No—Yang Kai suddenly realized something; his expression shifted slightly.

A true Corpse Puppet should retain some of the divine abilities and secret techniques it had in life, but since this puppet began fighting, Yang Kai hadn’t seen it use any powerful methods. All its attacks were straightforward, relying solely on its fists, and when pressed it would only spit out corpse poison.

It didn’t seem to have the formidable traits of a Corpse Puppet.

This Corpse Puppet before him... was flawed! Yang Kai suddenly understood.

In other words, this Corpse Puppet was a failed, half-finished product, not refined to perfection. Thinking about it, even if a martial artist was incredibly strong—even at the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm—trying to turn oneself into a puppet would mean enduring unimaginable torment and pain. The slightest mishap would lead to failure in the refining process.

Yang Kai guessed that the Sect Master of that generation’s Thousand Leaves Sect must have failed to achieve perfection during the refining process, resulting in his turning into a defective product.

At this thought, Yang Kai’s spirits lifted.

If this were a true Corpse Puppet of the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, he would have no chance of victory. But if it was just a failed, flawed product, then he might still have a chance—he just needed to find the Corpse Puppet’s weakness and attack it.

With this in mind, Yang Kai hurriedly shouted, “Hold him off! Buy me a little time!”

After speaking, Yang Kai activated the World-Ending Demon Eye, carefully examining the Corpse Puppet. Golden light burst from his left eye, as if it could pierce through appearances and see deep within, discerning the structure and patterns inside.

Although Liu Yan and the Incarnation didn’t know what he was planning, they sensed something from Yang Kai’s tone. Liu Yan, in particular, spared no effort in unleashing her special flames to burn the Corpse Puppet, holding its corpse poison at bay.

The Incarnation, who had been knocked away, returned once more. This time he didn’t charge recklessly at the Corpse Puppet, but instead gripped the earth below with one hand. Instantly, the power of earth laws spread out; the soil beneath his feet seemed to liquefy, slowly swirling and rising at his command.

In the blink of an eye, a towering earthen spear formed in his palm. Though formed purely from local soil, the spear was entwined with Law Power, making it no less than a Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure.

The Incarnation gripped the earthen spear and hurled it forward with all his might.

Boom...

The void was blasted open, creating a visible vacuum that smashed straight into the Corpse Puppet. With a dull metallic clang, sparks flew from the Corpse Puppet’s body.

Yet this strike only left a small dent in the Corpse Puppet’s body, failing to pierce through it completely.

"So tough?" the Incarnation exclaimed.

He knew the power of his own attack. It was definitely a move that could seriously injure an Emperor Realm master, but it had no effect on the Corpse Puppet, showing just how tough its body was. Its flesh was even more resilient than an Emperor-Grade defensive Secret Treasure.

If even such a blow couldn’t harm it, how could they possibly win this fight? The Incarnation couldn’t help but feel a headache coming on.

That strike had enraged the Corpse Puppet. After the earthen spear shattered against it, the puppet roared, and the corpse poison it spat out became even more ferocious. The stalemate with Liu Yan was instantly broken—the green corpse poison surged rapidly toward her, overwhelming her flames.

Seeing this, the Incarnation’s expression changed drastically. Gritting his teeth, he reached into the void, and in the next moment, a massive warhammer appeared in his hand. It was shrouded in dense, pitch-black evil aura, as if it could stir the deepest malice and negative emotions in one’s heart, making people shudder in fear!

Demonic Warhammer!

This was the demonic weapon of an Ancient Giant Demon. The Demonic Qi was chilling. Previously, it had already developed sentience, and after Yang Kai dragged it into the Small Xuan Realm, it had been entrusted to the Incarnation. No one knew when the Incarnation had managed to refine it.

However, it seemed the refining wasn’t complete, because as soon as the Demonic Warhammer appeared, the Incarnation’s eyes trembled violently, turning blood-red and filled with savage brutality—clearly affected by the ancient Demonic Qi.

The pitch-black aura coiled around the Incarnation’s thick arm like a living thing, spreading to other parts of his body and gradually turning him black.

With the warhammer in hand, the Incarnation’s aura swelled dramatically. In that instant, he seemed to become the Ancient Giant Demon itself, standing proudly and looking down on all creation.

The Spiritual Qi of the entire secret realm buzzed and trembled, the laws thrown into chaos.

Even Yang Kai was left dumbfounded by this sudden turn of events.

He had no idea when the Incarnation had started refining the warhammer. But seeing the Incarnation’s state, he knew the battle had to end quickly—otherwise, if the Demonic Qi completely blackened the Incarnation, he would become a puppet controlled by the weapon.

With this thought, he dared not be distracted by his Soul Incarnation any longer, focusing even more intently on finding the Corpse Puppet’s weakness.

Meanwhile, the Incarnation had already raised the warhammer high, aiming it at the Corpse Puppet from afar.

The Corpse Puppet seemed to sense danger as well, struggling and roaring atop the cliff, trying to break free.

Before it could act, the Incarnation brought the warhammer down.

That strike was as traceless as a hornless antelope, yet it seemed to come from ancient times, shattering space and turning heaven and earth upside down.

The massive warhammer shadow cleaved straight into the Corpse Puppet.

Rumble...

The cliff was split open, a huge chasm appearing like a heavenly moat. Where the warhammer shadow passed, wild power raged, tearing the earth apart, ravines crisscrossing, space thrown into disorder.

Liu Yan had already fled far away, but the chaotic, powerful vortex behind her still pulled at her, threatening to swallow her whole. In desperation, she had to transform back into human form, shaking her delicate body to barely escape.

After that strike, the Incarnation’s towering aura suddenly collapsed, and he stood unsteadily, clearly drained by the attack.

Worse still, the black aura coiling around his arm spread rapidly across his body.

"Miscalculated!" Even the Incarnation hadn’t expected that wielding this Demonic Warhammer would consume so much power. Had he known earlier, he would never have used it at this moment.

Underestimating the Demonic Warhammer meant letting the ancient Demonic Qi take advantage.

At the critical moment, Yang Kai flashed to the Incarnation’s side. Their eyes met, and without words, they understood each other’s thoughts.

In the next instant, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense surged, collecting the Incarnation and the warhammer into the Small Xuan Realm, placing them beside the medicine garden.

The Incarnation now needed to rely on the power of the Two-Color Seal from the Firmament Tree to suppress the Demonic Qi—there was no other way.

Liu Yan’s delicate figure swayed as she came to Yang Kai’s side, her beautiful eyes filled with worry as she gazed into the distance. “Master...”

Without the Incarnation’s support, she alone couldn’t restrain the powerful Corpse Puppet, so she couldn’t help but feel anxious.

Yang Kai grinned and said, “Don’t worry, I’ve found his weakness.”

Hearing this, Liu Yan finally relaxed a little.

In the huge chasm ahead, the Corpse Puppet lay on its back. Although that earth-shattering blow had drained the Incarnation, the Corpse Puppet certainly hadn’t come out unscathed.

When it finally managed to stand, Liu Yan immediately noticed a huge wound on its body, running diagonally from the shoulder down to the thigh. The flesh at the wound was turned over, corpse poison billowing out, no blood in sight, but the white bones within were visible.

And at a certain spot, there seemed to be a densely packed array, shining with a faint glow.

Liu Yan instantly understood—this was the core of all the arrays inside the Corpse Puppet. If it could be destroyed, the Corpse Puppet would be rendered powerless. Previously, its tough body had hidden its internal structure, but the Incarnation’s strike had exposed this weakness.

The Incarnation’s blow had been a major contribution.

“Step back a little,” Yang Kai said as he charged straight at the Corpse Puppet.

Even though the Corpse Puppet looked badly wounded, Yang Kai didn’t dare be careless. As a lifeless puppet, no matter how severe its injuries, as long as its weakness wasn’t destroyed, its fighting power wouldn’t be affected.

The slightest mistake on Yang Kai’s part would mean utter disaster.

Midway there, he moved his hand slightly, and a pale blue, pigeon-egg-sized bead appeared between his fingers. It looked unremarkable, but inside, a faint hair-thin arc of lightning flickered.

Extinction Thunder Bead!

One of the two Imperial Treasures left behind by Yang Yan in the past.

Since arriving in the Star Realm, Yang Kai had never used the Extinction Thunder Bead—partly because he didn’t dare reveal it, and partly because he hadn’t faced an enemy strong enough to require an Imperial Treasure.

But the Corpse Puppet was definitely worthy.

So he planned to use this trump card to destroy the Corpse Puppet.

As he charged, Yang Kai grew solemn. The Corpse Puppet, seemingly dazed by the Incarnation’s blow, took a while to get up. By the time it shakily sat up, Yang Kai was already in position and, without hesitation, poured his Origin Qi into the Extinction Thunder Bead.

The Extinction Thunder Bead was different from other Imperial Treasures—Yang Kai could use it even back in the Origin Returning Realm. But its power was directly tied to the user’s cultivation: the stronger the cultivation, the greater the power unleashed.

Back in the Origin Returning Realm, Yang Kai could destroy a Void King with all his strength. Now, as a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, the power he could unleash was on a whole different level.

As soon as he activated his Origin Qi, Yang Kai’s expression changed.

He felt the Extinction Thunder Bead in his hand suddenly become a bottomless pit, a powerful suction drawing in his Origin Qi as if it had been starved for countless years and was finally being fed, greedily devouring his energy.

Yang Kai was shocked, but he didn’t dare stop; he could only grit his teeth and endure.
