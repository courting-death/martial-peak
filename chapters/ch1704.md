## Chapter 1704 — Little Dolphin

Yang Kai was joyfully harvesting when he suddenly heard the sound of splashing nearby. Looking over, he saw a dolphin about three feet long swimming toward him. It stopped before a blue Sea Lotus, opened its mouth, and swallowed the blossom whole in one gulp.

Though most of its body remained submerged, the creature—shaped like a dolphin—held itself with great elegance; even the way it chewed the Sea Lotus was leisurely and composed.

When Yang Kai looked toward it, the little dolphin blinked, showing no sign of fear; its tail slapped the surface as it lazily swam toward another pink Sea Lotus.

After a moment, that pink Sea Lotus vanished into its mouth as well.

The little dolphin seemed to be in excellent spirits; even the speed with which it flicked its tail had increased considerably.

Yang Kai had thought to drive it off, but after a moment’s thought he let the idea go—ever since he set foot into the sea, every sea beast he met without exception had been a murderous fiend that attacked without warning.

This little dolphin looked harmless, and Yang Kai could sense no danger from it, so he allowed it to be.

The two of them—one man and one dolphin—split up and quickly cleaned out that patch of Sea Lotus.

Yang Kai gathered six silver lotuses and one golden lotus, while the little dolphin only managed to pick up a few scraps; it looked a bit unhappy, then, taking a daring move, swam up to Yang Kai, circled him, and made odd noises.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh; after the little dolphin nudged him with its head once, he had to take a cyan lotus from his Spatial Ring.

He found himself unable to refuse the longing in the little dolphin’s eyes.

The little dolphin’s eyes brightened in an instant and it made urgent, rapid sounds like a baby crying out to be fed.

Yang Kai held the cyan lotus to its mouth; the little dolphin swallowed it in one bite, its eyes narrowing into crescent moons—quite a charming sight.

With the lotus consumed, the little dolphin belched contentedly and swam even faster circles around Yang Kai, noticeably more affectionate than before.

Yang Kai grinned; after being soaked in seawater for days, his chilled body felt considerably warmer.

Not far off, seawater split as something moved in a straight line toward them; something beneath the waves had scented Yang Kai and the little dolphin and its appetite had been stoked.

The little dolphin’s senses were sharp; it immediately hid behind Yang Kai, poking half its head out to peer in that direction, its eyes showing a humanlike terror.

Yang Kai patted it to calm it and signaled it to stay still; his eyes narrowed as he stared at the sea beast approaching them.

In a moment, towering waves leapt up and a terrifying sea beast burst from the depths—its appearance dreadful, its body ten zhang long like a shark—opening its jaws with serrated teeth flashing deadly light as it lunged to bite Yang Kai.

The little dolphin’s tail thrashed wildly as it emitted anxious, rapid cries.

Yang Kai did not move; only when the sea beast closed to about three chi from him did he suddenly strike, his fist like lightning slamming into the beast’s forehead.

Centered on Yang Kai, the nearby sea surface plunged downwards, a ring of ripples spreading swiftly outward.

Boom……

With the naked eye one could see the fearsome beast’s forehead collapse inward; its massive body crumpled and, driven by the tremendous force, was flung hundreds of zhang away before finally crashing back into the sea.

Soon the water there ran crimson; the huge sea beast floated belly-up, utterly motionless.

The little dolphin was clearly stunned for a moment, its bright eyes flicking to Yang Kai, then to the distant sea beast, and back to Yang Kai...

It seemed utterly unable to comprehend how such a small Yang Kai could have sent such a large sea beast flying—there was simply no comparison between their sizes.

It did not dwell on the matter long; instead it regarded Yang Kai with eyes full of worshipful adoration, made sounds resembling joy, then swam up to him and butted his side with its head.

Yang Kai stared at it in surprise, puzzled as to what it wanted.

The little dolphin continued to nudge him.

After a long while Yang Kai finally understood, pointed at the dolphin’s back, and asked, “You want me to get on?”

The little dolphin nodded vigorously.

Yang Kai’s expression was odd; looking at its three-chi body, he hesitated, “Isn’t that a bit small? You might not be able to carry me.”

He worried the little dolphin could not bear his weight.

The little dolphin would not be deterred; it dove beneath the waves, and in the next instant Yang Kai felt something lift him up and they began to rise smoothly.

A moment later, the little dolphin surfaced halfway out of the water, chirping joyfully as it darted forward at high speed.

Cutting through wind and waves, swift and steady, Yang Kai clicked his tongue in admiration: “I underestimated you.”

The little dolphin swam at a speed at least ten times faster than Yang Kai could manage; as it plunged ahead the water seemed to part willingly to either side, offering no resistance.

The dolphin looked back proudly at Yang Kai as if to say, “Praise me more.”

Yang Kai laughed heartily and rested assured on the little dolphin’s back as it carried him forward at full speed.

This creature, which resembled a dolphin, was of an unknown species; given its earlier timidity it would seem unlikely it could survive in such a harsh environment, yet it understood Yang Kai’s words—its intelligence was not low, at least comparable to that of a seven or eight year old child.

With the little dolphin as his mount, Yang Kai was considerably more comfortable; at least he no longer had to be soaked in seawater all day.

As for why it treated him with such affection and even invited him to ride on its back, it likely understood that without Yang Kai’s protection it would be hard to survive here.

It was a kind of cooperation then, a mutually beneficial arrangement.

At first Yang Kai thought the little dolphin would be of little use beyond being a mount, but he soon discovered he had been mistaken.

A grave mistake!

This small creature swam about the sea seemingly without method or purpose, yet it always led Yang Kai to scattered Sea Lotuses hidden in the deep.

Yang Kai had at first thought it mere luck, but after two days he realized it was the little dolphin’s ability—it seemed able to precisely locate Sea Lotuses several thousand to ten thousand li away.

Yang Kai reaped a great harvest!

Beyond the dozens of Sea Lotuses he had initially found himself, in the following days he collected at least another hundred.

Pink and cyan Sea Lotuses remained the most numerous; the silver ones were fewer, and there were only three golden lotuses—rare treasures indeed.

These were unique to Ghost Isle — nowhere else in the world could such things be found. With these Sea Lotuses, Yang Kai could refine large quantities of Body-Tempering Pills, not only to strengthen his own physique but also to help his friends and companions greatly enhance their physical foundations.

Thus, the more Sea Lotuses he could gather, the better.

The little dolphin’s belly was now round and full! Since it was the one who had led Yang Kai to find the Sea Lotuses, he naturally didn’t stop it from eating its fill.

In the blink of an eye, about half a month had passed. Yang Kai’s Spatial Ring now held no fewer than five hundred Sea Lotuses. Though he wasn’t certain how valuable they were on Ghost Isle, just comparing the yield near the coast to that in the deeper seas was enough for him to tell that Sea Lotuses must be a scarce and precious resource here as well.

Unless Ghost Isle organized experts to explore and harvest the far seas, only then could they obtain substantial gains; otherwise they could only seek in the near seas.

One day the little dolphin led Yang Kai to an island.

The island was not large—only a dozen or so li across—less than one percent the size of Ghost Isle.

This was Yang Kai’s first time seeing another island besides Ghost Isle, and naturally, his curiosity was piqued. The island was connected to the sea by a broad sea channel that ran straight into its interior.

The little dolphin followed that sea channel and entered within.

After a short while Yang Kai came upon a lake inside the island that connected to the outer sea and took up about one-fifth of the island’s area; within the lake countless Sea Lotuses bloomed in a riot of colors, dazzling the eye—by rough count the island lake held at least a thousand Sea Lotuses.

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up.

Even with the great gains he had enjoyed these days, he could not help but smile broadly at the sight.

“Well done!” Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the little dolphin’s back, rapped its head and praised it generously.

The little dolphin was ecstatic.

After days spent together the little dolphin had grown ever more dependent and affectionate toward Yang Kai, especially after he casually killed several sea beasts; it practically idolized him.

Those sea beasts were gargantuan threats to it, each capable of swallowing it alive; to Yang Kai, however, a single punch could fell them.

Before long, man and dolphin reached a lake at the island’s center. Yang Kai leapt down, stepping across the lotus leaves as he swiftly weaved through the water. One after another, Sea Lotuses of various colors were gathered into his Spatial Ring, while the Little Dolphin refused to be outdone — gulping the blossoms whole, and within just a few mouthfuls, its belly had grown round once more.

Afterwards it idly swam the lake as if without a care in the world.

In about the span of an hour, Yang Kai had harvested over two-thirds of the lake’s Sea Lotus.

Just as he brimmed with energy and prepared to clear the place out, a thunderous roar reached his ears, filled with the plaintive bitterness of blood and tears and an indescribable grief as if someone had lost their parents.

“Bastard! How dare you steal this Old Master’s Huntian Lotuses!”

With those words a figure stormed over from not far away, eyes full of murderous hatred as he stared at Yang Kai; he thrust his feet into the ground and leapt into the air.

The ground was left with two deep footprints.

Suspended midair, the man thrust a punch at Yang Kai.

The blow was soundless and seemed weightless, yet Yang Kai’s eyelids twitched and his expression turned grave; he drew a deep breath, gave a long shout, leapt into the air, and met the punch with one of his own.

Their fists met without any flourish, and visible ripples of force spread through the air like waves across water.

The scene seemed to freeze.

After a short while there came a deafening crash as violent force erupted, warping the surrounding space.

Yang Kai was sent flying, and the unknown cultivator likewise lost his balance, tumbling several times through the air — just as he had come, so too was he struck back the same way.
