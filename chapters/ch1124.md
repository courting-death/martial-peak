## Chapter 1124 — Hundred Mountains

The rotating power of the spear stirred the air, and a sleeping tornado suddenly spiraled into being, spanning out behind Yang Kai with terrifying momentum.

The spear fashioned from Shadow Soul Threads struck with blistering speed, arriving before Yang Kai in the blink of an eye. To everyone's shock, Yang Kai showed no intention of dodging; instead he reached out a hand and grabbed at the spear.

Demonic Flame rolled across his palm, and Yang Kai's expression turned solemn—he was clearly exerting himself to the utmost.

Stab...

A piercing, sickening sound rang out. The instant Yang Kai seized the spear, the enormous rotational force spun him around; the speed was unreal, as if he were being flung, and his body kept retreating.

Golden blood splattered out.

But soon Yang Kai's backward momentum slowed; the body that had been whipped about and disappeared from sight gradually steadied, and finally came to rest.

Besides the rolling Demonic Flame on his palm, a burnt smell wafted forth—he had clearly suffered some minor wounds.

He paid it no mind. Xu Zhishen's black filaments were maddeningly hard to guard against and peculiarly strange; even Demonic Flame couldn't burn them. Whatever they were, Yang Kai resolved to first neutralize or seize them.

Otherwise he'd keep using that thing to attack, and Yang Kai truly wouldn't tolerate it.

No sooner had Yang Kai regained his footing than Xu Zhishen shot up above him like a great roc. Amid Yang Flame and Wu Yi's cries, a violent torrent of power poured from Xu Zhishen's palms, unleashing a series of eerie assaults that slammed toward Yang Kai.

Holding the black spear, Yang Kai unleashed his soul power and surged into the threads. He burned away the Divine Sense imprint Xu Zhishen had left, wiping out his control over the thing, then followed with a Heaven-Covering Palm.

Boom, boom, boom...

With an earth-shattering roar, Xu Zhishen flew back like a kite with its string cut, landing face-up and vomiting blood midair; his face went deathly pale again.

Yang Kai also staggered back a dozen steps; the arm that had met the attack felt momentarily weak, his chest's Qi and blood churned. A mouthful of Golden Blood gushed forth.

Yet his condition was clearly far better than Xu Zhishen's. A excited smile spread across his face as he glanced at the countless threads scattered across his hand and tossed them straight into his Spatial Ring.

"You... you could actually erase my soul imprint in an instant?" Xu Zhishen's face changed drastically, whether from rage or disbelief it was hard to tell. His body trembled as he pointed a hand at Yang Kai—and spat blood again.

"Hahaha!" Yang Kai laughed, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, and said proudly, "Old dog, I said I wanted that thing—so I took it!"

Brazen! Overbearing! Intimidating!

The crowd erupted.

Only then did everyone recall that Yang Kai had indeed said that earlier. Who would have thought that in scarcely ten breaths he would truly do it.

A Saint Realm martial artist had just snatched a Secret Treasure from the hands of someone of the Saint King Realm, and had erased that Saint King Realm's Divine Sense imprint in an instant—what a tremendous soul power that must be! How could he possibly possess such ability?

"Damn!" Yu Feng couldn't help but curse; his eyes trembled violently.

Not only Yang Flame and Wu Yi were dazzled and heartily relieved, even the young women of the Haike Family—peers of Wu Yi—revealed admiration in their eyes, looking at Yang Kai with near-feral hunger.

They suddenly realized the so-called promising youths they'd seen before weren't even in the same league as this mysterious man; those others were simply trash.

Even Ba Qingyan's pupils constricted, terror welling deep in his gaze.

Xu Zhishen's caliber—he understood it better than anyone. One-on-one he might not be unbeatable, but to have his Secret Treasure wrested away by that youth in merely two moves, and to look so badly wounded—what would happen if he personally faced that youth?

Ba Qingyan suddenly felt his head ache and his chest tighten.

Yang Kai laughed with supreme delight—not because he'd taken Xu Zhishen's Secret Treasure, but because he realized his current combat strength could indeed contend with someone at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm. Granted, Xu Zhishen's fighting prowess at that rank might not be top-tier, yet the disparity of Realm was undeniable.

And he hadn't even used his full strength.

The mysteries of spatial force, the power of Golden Blood, the World-Ending Demon Eye... those trump cards he had not employed. He had relied only on the power stored within his own body.

"Elder!" The Xu Family's Saint King Realm cultivators saw Xu Zhishen suffering loss and changed color, crying out.

Xu Zhishen waved his hand to stop them from stepping forward. His face twisted with a feral, crazed expression as he roared hysterically, “Good, good, good! The younger generation truly is fearsome. I never thought someone like you would appear—but if I don’t kill you today, I swear I’m no man!”

Saying that, he suddenly produced an ancient, unadorned scroll. A heavy, solid momentum rippled from the scroll; once it unfurled everyone felt their chests tighten, as if something pressed down upon their heads.

"Hundred Mountains Painting!" Ba Qingyan clearly recognized the scroll and his face changed as he shouted, "Retreat!"

The Haike Family folk trusted his words and obeyed, immediately falling back, and the Xu Family members likewise knew the danger and likewise fled.

Seeing them run, Wu Yi and Yu Feng grew uneasy; Wu Yi urged, "We should fall back too!"

"No need!" Yang Flame waved her hand. Strange little devices appeared in her palm; she placed them around, encircling the three of them. Soon everything was arranged and she clapped her hands merrily, "This spot is perfect—just right for watching the show."

Wu Yi stared at her speechless, wondering whether she was foolishly brave or simply clueless.

But it was now too late to withdraw. The moment Xu Zhishen unleashed the Hundred Mountains Painting, the scroll spat forth the phantasmal image of a small mountain. That mini-peak was dozens of zhang high and bore a momentum that could undo heaven and earth as it slammed toward Yang Kai.

An unimaginable sense of peril rose from Yang Kai's chest; his expression shifted and, without hesitation, he formed several Vast Heaven Shields above his head.

"I'll tear you to pieces!" Xu Zhishen roared as the mountain image slammed down.

Crack...

The freshly formed Vast Heaven Shields offered no resistance and were crushed by the mountain image. The illusion showed no sign of slowing and continued to press down.

Yang Kai trudged with difficulty, inwardly seething.

This Hundred Mountains Painting was clearly at Origin-Grade; although its images seemed insubstantial, they bore the weight of a real small mountain. Were he to be struck, even his formidable constitution would not suffice.

Forced, Yang Kai had no choice but to use spatial power.

In a flash his figure vanished from the spot.

The small mountain smashed through Yang Kai's afterimage; the earth trembled violently, cracks webbed across the ground, even distant peaks shuddered, and countless birds burst into flight in all directions.

Xu Zhishen paused a moment before bursting into loud laughter. "Young one, you know my might now, do you? Dare to contend with me and you are still green."

"Ah!" Wu Yi turned deathly pale—she had thought Yang Kai was done for.

"Old dog, are you only good at barking?" Yang Kai's voice suddenly came from the side as his Heaven-Slaying Spear, exploiting the subtle art of spatial mastery, pierced the spatial seal and instantly appeared before Xu Zhishen.

Xu Zhishen, arrogant moments before, broke out in a cold sweat. Without hesitation he frantically pushed his Saint Yuan, and from his Hundred Mountains Painting another mountain phantasm leapt forth—this one larger than the last, a full hundred zhang high.

The Heaven-Slaying Spear was stopped by that mountain phantasm and failed in its strike.

Xu Zhishen, enraged, pointed his hand and a second grand peak once more came crashing down toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai finally understood why the treasure was called the Hundred Mountains Painting: the scroll contained depictions of a full hundred peaks—when Xu summoned one, the scroll had one less, and each summoned peak grew larger and more terrible. The largest alone made Yang Kai's heart quake; to be struck by it would mean instantaneous annihilation.

Though he knew Xu Zhishen could never possibly unleash all one hundred peaks, the treasure's power was nonetheless formidable.

The second peak hurtled toward Yang Kai with terrifying speed, while the first, smaller peak rose to flank him from left and right.

Each mountain phantom exuded a heavy, oppressive aura that muddled Yang Kai's movements and his Saint Yuan, making them hard to marshal.

Xu Zhishen truly went mad, immediately summoning a third and a fourth peak.

With four peaks cutting him off, Yang Kai found himself with nowhere to dodge.

A violent cacophony erupted as that space seemed to collapse. Torrents of fierce qi swept outward; Dragon Lair Mountain's sands and stones were sent flying, countless trees were uprooted and reduced to powder in the blast.

Staring at this apocalyptic sight, the Xu Family and Haike Family cultivators' faces drained of color.

They realized that if they hadn't fallen back just then, even watching would have left them caught in the wreckage. Even now, the gusting qi made everyone's skin sting like knife-cuts; the weaker ones had to marshal force to resist, and several had already been swept away and were nowhere to be seen—dead or alive was unknown.

"Once the Hundred Mountains Painting is unleashed, I too must avoid the brunt—this young man is finished," Ba Qingyan said, exhaling lightly, his face betraying a strange mix of relief and regret.

In the chaotic battlefield only one spot remained unscathed: where Yang Flame, Wu Yi and Yu Feng stood. When the devastating qi bore down they had felt as if doom was inevitable.

Unexpectedly, a light barrier appeared before them. Ripples ran across it, intercepting the oncoming qi, and the three were left entirely unharmed.
