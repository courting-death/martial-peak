## Chapter 1861 — Make a Move

Li Nuo ignored the shouts of the warriors beneath the platform, stepped aside to signal, and a maid immediately brought the auction item forward.

This time she did not bother with theatrics or to cover it with a red cloth; when everyone looked closely they discovered the object was plainly a chunk of ore.

It was approximately the size of a baby's skull, smooth and lustrous all over, emitting a faint cyan sheen.

Judging from how the maid supported it, the auction piece was not heavy, so lifting it was not a strain.

The commotion gradually quieted; everyone's eyes were drawn to it and they examined it with curiosity, while countless Divine Senses from the private rooms swept repeatedly over the auction item.

Yet not a single person discerned its secret.

Even Yang Kai frowned, his face full of doubt.

With his present Divine Sense, there were few things in the world he could not probe, but he could not make anything out of this; thus it was clear that even if the final auction item was not priceless, it was certainly far from ordinary.

This stirred a little interest in Yang Kai.

Li Nuo parted her red lips and, in a clear voice, said, "This item was also obtained by our Tongtian Auction House by chance. Since acquiring it we have been studying its uses, but regrettably the talents at the Tongtian Auction House have dwindled and we have not been able to fathom it. We can only conclude it is a superior refining material. Today this hall is full of high experts; perhaps some Lord here may be able to perceive its nature and know its purpose. If any Lord wins this item, I humbly ask that you not be stingy in instructing me so I may resolve my doubts."

"Spare the nonsense—how do we bid on this?" someone below shouted impatiently.

Li Nuo smiled faintly. "The final auction item. An unknown refining material. Starting price... thirty million!"

After a brief silence the warriors in the hall burst into loud laughter; plainly they found Li Nuo's starting price absurd.

Li Nuo paid them no mind and still stood on the platform with a smile.

As she had said, the Tongtian Auction House had studied this item for a long time and could not determine its purpose; even Chun Yi could not judge what it did, but ignorance did not detract from its value.

Li Nuo had once compared it with some Void King-Grade refining materials and found that none of those matched this piece.

In other words, it was at the very least undoubtedly a Void King-Grade refining material.

If it sold that was good; if not, it did not matter—an auction item going unsold was a common occurrence.

For a long while no one bid; the last item truly seemed destined to go unsold. Li Nuo's beautiful eyes swept around and a trace of disappointment showed.

"Miss Li Nuo, could you bring that thing over for me to see?" a steady voice suddenly called from one of the private rooms.

Li Nuo turned toward the voice and found it came from the expert in Room A-5; she smiled slightly and nodded, "By all means, my Lord, please wait a moment."

Saying so, she signaled the maid, who hurried toward Yang Kai's room.

In Room A-5, Yang Kai's brow was knit and a trace of gravity showed in his eyes.

Hua Youmeng asked in surprise, "Lord, do you recognize what this is?"

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. "I cannot be certain yet; I must look carefully."

Hua Youmeng nodded in understanding.

Elsewhere, in Room A-1, Jiang Changfeng's expression shifted and a cruel light crossed his face. "Great Elder, the speaker is that man," he said.

Gongsun Liang raised an eyebrow and squinted. "The Third Venerable of our Purple Star?"

"Indeed!" Jiang Changfeng nodded solemnly. "Not long ago I was sent at your order to invite that man, yet he rudely refused. I even emphasized it was the Great Elder's summons, but he simply would not comply; he is terribly insolent."

Gongsun Liang stroked his beard and sneered, "Only the truly capable may be insolent. I had intended to visit him another day, but did not expect to chance upon him here; then so be it... let us exchange a few words. I want to see if this Venerable One truly has skill or is merely a paper tiger!"

Jiang Changfeng's eyes flickered with schadenfreude; he knew Gongsun Liang was inwardly vexed that Yang Kai had shown him no courtesy.

Yang Kai accepted the auction item, regarded it gravely, gathered his Divine Sense into a beam, and probed into its interior.

Hua Youmeng and the maid dared not interrupt.

At first nothing appeared amiss, but in an instant Yang Kai's face changed; his eyes widened as if struck, and a surging tide of Divine Sense blasted forth, forming a shield before him.

A faint, crisp sound rang out.

The Divine Sense defense was instantly breached; just as Yang Kai, horrified, prepared to resist again, everything calmed as suddenly as it had erupted.

The entire auction hall fell silent; ninety-nine percent of the warriors turned pale and trembled.

The moment Yang Kai's Divine Sense had burst forth was like a dormant dragon poking its head from its lair, plunging everyone into a chill as if into an ice cellar.

Fortunately it came and went quickly; otherwise someone might have gone mad.

In the private room a flash of delight crossed Yang Kai's eyes and vanished; he calmly handed the auction item back to the maid and said lightly, "That will do. You may leave."

"Yes!" the maid took the item and hurried away without daring to draw a breath.

"I would like to observe as well—Miss Li Nuo, would you oblige?" came the voice from Room A-1.

He was genuinely curious why Yang Kai had suddenly emitted such a powerful Divine Sense; whether regarding Yang Kai himself or the item, Gongsun Liang had developed strong interest.

"If the Great Elder wishes to see it, of course," Li Nuo said with pursed lips and a smile.

The maid turned and brought the last auction item over to Gongsun Liang.

Gongsun Liang inspected it for much longer than Yang Kai had, but unlike Yang Kai he did not cause that commotion. The anxious warriors in the hall relaxed, thinking the Great Elder was indeed exceptional and not comparable to ordinary experts.

With Yang Kai and Gongsun Liang leading the way, the experts in the other private rooms all made similar requests.

The final auction item passed from hand to hand among the experts, and only after the time it took an incense stick to burn did it return to the auction platform.

Li Nuo said with a gentle smile, “I wonder if any of you esteemed guests can recognize this material. If someone can tell me exactly what it is, I would be deeply grateful. And if you manage to win the bid for it later, I can make the decision to give that person a ten-percent discount.”

"Miss Li Nuo, old as I am, I can only see that this thing is incomparably hard; it must be a Void King-Grade refining material," an elderly voice called from a B-Class room.

"You can say that," another elder retorted. "I also see it as a Void King-Grade material, but precisely what it is remains unknown."

"Could this be a piece of Fenggang Silver? Rumor holds Fenggang Silver is the breath of an Ancient Divine Spirit true phoenix condensed into ore and refined into form—exceptionally hard, its fire-attribute energy restrained and not dispersed. I sense a faint warmth pulsing within this piece, much like the accounts of Fenggang Silver."

"Elder Xu, are you blind? Fenggang Silver is fiery red; this thing is cyan—clearly different. How can you liken it to that?"

The earlier speaker was instantly silenced, evidently recognizing his conjecture had been hasty.

Li Nuo stood on the platform and smiled, "Everyone, please remain calm. Let us auction the item first, shall we?"

She could see they likely could not identify the final auction item; letting them quarrel would merely waste time.

"Miss Li Nuo, you decide," someone said.

"Very well—I'll start with thirty million!" the elder who had just suggested Fenggang Silver declared.

Whatever the piece truly was, it was undeniably a Void King-Grade material, and such a large chunk, if refined into a Secret Treasure, would be worthwhile.

A Void King-Grade Secret Treasure could be treated like a family heirloom; many sects did not even possess one.

"Thirty-one million!"

"Thirty-three million!"

For some reason, after being examined by so many, the final auction item suddenly became popular; although prices did not skyrocket, the threat of it going unsold was averted.

Soon the price was pushed to forty-two million.

At that point many began to withdraw.

Perhaps in their minds spending so many Saint Crystals on an unknown object was not worth it; only three or five people remained bidding. If nothing unexpected happened, the final sale price should be around fifty million.

Indeed, after another round of bidding the price stabilized at fifty-one million, and at that point no one raised further.

Disappointment flickered in Li Nuo's eyes just as she was about to speak, when a bid suddenly came from Room A-5: "Sixty million!"

Yang Kai had acted.

Li Nuo looked toward Room A-5, surprise flashing in her beautiful eyes.

Yang Kai had remained inactive before; she had assumed he held no interest in the item, but now she realized he had relied on his status and waited until the end to deliver the decisive blow.

This was a trick often used by powerful warriors, tried and true.

Had he discerned what the material actually was? Li Nuo wondered; after all, Yang Kai had been the first to inspect the auction item and had caused such a commotion.

If Yang Kai had gleaned nothing and still offered such a high price, Li Nuo would not believe it.

She did not press him and instead waited for the final price to be settled.

Once Yang Kai bid, the others fell silent.

Not only was the price beyond any of their limits, Yang Kai's strength was such that none dared offend him.

Thus, after the sixty million bid, no one matched it.

Li Nuo quickly said, "This Lord has bid sixty million—anyone higher? If not, I will begin the countdown..."
