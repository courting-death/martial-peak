## Chapter 2193 — Advancing and Retreating at Will

As Wuchang let out an angry shout, a figure shot out leisurely.

But it wasn’t Wuchang who moved—it was Luo Yuan.

Stepping with incredibly profound footwork, he instantly closed in on the spot affected by the Spatial Law, hovering in midair with his gaze coldly fixed below. Then he raised both hands high, clenching them into fists, locking them together, and smashed down fiercely.

Violent energy surged forth.
Suddenly, behind Luo Yuan, a colossal figure over ten zhang tall appeared. Though vaguely human-shaped, its presence was awe-inspiring—like a giant spirit god descending. It raised two sky-supporting hands, perfectly mirroring Luo Yuan’s movements.

Boom…

A moment later, a deafening crash rang out as the massive fist shadow smashed into the area affected by the Spatial Domain.

Yang Kai’s expression changed drastically.

He saw the surrounding spatial cracks shatter, and the Domain he had created was violently torn apart.

Before he could react, Wuchang suddenly leapt out from behind Luo Yuan, from Yang Kai’s blind spot. One hand held a saber, the other a sword—the saber’s blade crimson as fire, the long sword pure and flawless.

Saber and sword crossed, radiating dazzling, bewildering light.

Wuchang merely crossed his saber and sword, and a layer of misty brilliance instantly surged forth. At the same time, he shouted, “Saber and Sword Suppress the Prison, Seal the Four Extremes!”

Sss sss sss sss…

Visible saber and sword lights filled the vast expanse, forming an invisible force that completely sealed off the space.

Everyone watched in awe, dumbfounded.

Wuchang and Luo Yuan—these two Southern Territory elites who had previously been at odds and had even clashed—now coordinated flawlessly. First, Luo Yuan unleashed a world-shaking blow to break Yang Kai’s spatial seal; then Wuchang cast a secret technique to restrain Yang Kai’s movements.

In this way, even though Yang Kai was proficient in Spatial Force, he was bound to become a turtle in a jar.

Their timing was so perfect it reached the pinnacle—even Senior Brothers who had trained together for years might not achieve such synergy.

Yet these two martial artists from different backgrounds managed it, relying solely on their own judgment and battle instincts.

“This is bad!” Xia Sheng’s expression changed as he called out in a low voice.

On the other side, Wuchang had already begun to sneer coldly. “Let’s see how you die now!”

As he spoke, his saber and sword twisted again, and a storm of red and white, filled with saber and sword light, suddenly swept toward Yang Kai.

He showed no mercy in his attack, clearly intending to kill Yang Kai on the spot.

Under everyone’s gaze, the storm directly engulfed Yang Kai, shredding his body to pieces—even the Ink Jade Cauldron beside him was torn apart…

“Ah?” Many people cried out at the sight, their faces showing extreme pain.

Although whether Yang Kai lived or died had nothing to do with them—and they didn’t care either—if the Supreme Mystic Pill was destroyed, that was something none of them could accept. In that case, Wuchang would become a sinner for the ages, taking the blame for Yang Kai!

Yet after unleashing his strike, Wuchang showed no joy at all. Instead, his face grew grave and he frowned deeply.

Luo Yuan was the same, looking around as if searching for something, while the giant spirit-like phantom behind him gradually faded away.

“My patience is limited…” a voice suddenly came from the side.

Everyone turned toward the voice and saw Yang Kai standing unharmed in the void, holding the alchemy furnace in his hands. His expression was dark as he swept his gaze below and declared loudly, “That last attack—I’ll take it as a test to see if I’m qualified to speak with you. Now that the result is clear, if anyone else dares attack me… I’ll swallow every last Supreme Mystic Pill in this furnace myself!”

“He’s crazy, crazy, crazy!”

“This guy is a madman.”

“Brother, don’t! Eating so many Pills isn’t good for you—how about giving me one?”

Wuchang frowned and muttered, “He really can teleport!”

He had suspected as much before. Since Yang Kai was proficient in Spatial Force, he could certainly ignore spatial barriers and use a secret technique akin to teleportation. That’s why he tried to seal off the area, hoping to catch Yang Kai like a turtle in a jar.

He believed his coordination with Luo Yuan was flawless, yet they still couldn’t do anything to Yang Kai.

He hadn’t even noticed when Yang Kai teleported away.

Just from this, he knew there was nothing they could do to Yang Kai.

Martial artists skilled in Spatial Force had an innate advantage in escaping and tracking—this rumor was no lie!

To kill or capture someone like Yang Kai, there were only a few ways: either bring in someone vastly stronger to crush him with absolute power, giving him no chance to use spatial abilities; lure him into an independent pocket space where he can’t escape; or create a barrier-like existence to trap him.

In the Four Seasons Land, no one could do such a thing.

Here, Yang Kai could act with utter impunity!

"Brother Yang, do you mean… you want to negotiate with us?" Lan Xun raised an elegant brow and spoke, having heard something different in Yang Kai’s words just now.

“Your Highness is right,” Yang Kai said with a grin. “But only halfway.”

“I’d like to hear the details!” Lan Xun smiled, lips pursed.

“I want to negotiate with them, not with you, Princess.” As Yang Kai spoke, he reached into his cauldron and took out a round, longan-sized, pure white, pearl-like Spiritual Pill.

A refreshing fragrance instantly spread out.

“Supreme Mystic Pill!” someone in the crowd exclaimed. Everyone’s eyes burned as they stared at the pill, knowing this was the legendary elixir that led straight to the Emperor Realm!

“Since one of the ingredients for refining the Supreme Mystic Pill was provided by Your Highness, as agreed before, I’ll give you one Spiritual Pill. Please accept it, Princess!” Yang Kai held the pill and gestured to Lan Xun.

“Oh? Brother Yang is willing to keep his promise?” Lan Xun looked at him in surprise. She had thought he wouldn’t do so, but things turned out differently than she expected.

Yang Kai replied solemnly, “Of course. The Supreme Mystic Pill’s success owes much to the Azure-Blood Ganoderma provided by Your Highness. Without it, there would be no Supreme Mystic Pill, so you naturally deserve one… As for the rest of you, you contributed nothing, just stood by and watched, yet want a Pill?” He spat disdainfully, “Keep dreaming.”

“Brother Yang’s actions are fair.” Lan Xun nodded slightly and said seriously, “In that case, I won’t stand on ceremony.”

With that, she gracefully walked over to Yang Kai.

Soon, she reached his side, accepted the Spiritual Pill he handed over, and whispered, “Thank you!”

“You’re too polite, Princess.” Yang Kai replied with a smile. “If you wish, you can take the pill right now. The Supreme Mystic Pill is different from other Spiritual Pills—it’s actually better to take it as early as possible, so its effects can be fully realized. When you reach the day of advancing to the Emperor Realm, the pill’s power will be at its peak!”

“Then… I’ll take it now!” Lan Xun said, and sure enough, she popped the Supreme Mystic Pill into her mouth and swallowed it.

Gulp…

The sound didn’t come from Lan Xun, but from the martial artists below, who watched her swallow the pill and couldn’t help but gulp themselves.

“With Your Highness’s peerless talent, aided by this Spiritual Pill, reaching the Emperor Realm is just around the corner. Allow me to wish you great fortune and a swift ascension!”

“Thank you for your kind words.” Lan Xun smiled faintly.

“Done flattering her?” Wuchang suddenly interrupted their conversation with a look of displeasure, coldly staring at Yang Kai. “I think I understand what you’re up to.”

“Oh?” Yang Kai raised his brows at Wuchang. “If you’ve figured it out, let’s hear it.”

“Hmph!” Wuchang snorted coldly. “The Supreme Mystic Pill has been refined, and you’re proficient in Spatial Force, so you can leave here at any time. But you haven’t left—instead, you’re still here, chattering away and deliberately showing off the pill to tempt everyone. What you want is nothing more than to use the Supreme Mystic Pill to trade for something from those present…”

He paused, then continued, “You’re a smart man. You know that even if you leave the Four Seasons Land with the Supreme Mystic Pill, you might not be able to keep it. As long as the martial artists here spread the news, the Emperor Realm experts outside the exit won’t let you go easily. They might not bully the weak and rob you, but they’ll definitely make you hand over the pill and give you some compensation in return…”

“But rather than passively accept whatever compensation others offer, it’s better to take the initiative and strive for the greatest benefit!” he concluded.

“Am I right or not?”

Yang Kai looked at Wuchang in astonishment, as if dumbfounded by his words.

After a while, he clapped and praised, “I really didn’t expect Brother Wuchang to be so astute.”

His words were an open admission that Wuchang was correct.

In fact, that was exactly what Yang Kai was thinking.

The Supreme Mystic Pill was indeed priceless. If possible, he truly wanted to take it away and later exchange it for other precious items he needed. He believed that with the name Supreme Mystic Pill, no one—no sect, not even the Star God Palace—would refuse.

But… just as Wuchang said, even if he took the pill out of the Four Seasons Land, there was no way he could really keep it. The Emperor Realm experts outside the exit would never allow it.

The most ideal outcome would be for those Emperor Realm experts to divide up his Supreme Mystic Pill and each give him a little compensation.

That was not what Yang Kai wanted to see.

What was his should remain under his control—even if he lost a little, he couldn't let others interfere.
