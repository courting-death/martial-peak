## Chapter 1266 — Forsaking the Near for the Far

Yang Kai had heard of people who could recognize a woman's scent, but he'd never heard of anyone who could sniff out the medicinal aroma and pill fragrance on another person. What Daiyuan said just now was absolutely correct: more than half a year ago he really had refined Origin Condensing Pills and Blood Lily Pills, and, of course, some other Pills as well. Whether the fragrance had long since dissipated or Daiyuan simply didn't detect it or chose not to mention it, he could not say.

This peculiar ability greatly surprised Yang Kai.

"Of course, if I judged solely by that, I still couldn't conclude that Junior Brother Yang Kai is an Origin-Grade alchemist — it might be that some master here is such a person, and Junior Brother Yang Kai merely picked up the pill scent from being around him. But..." Daiyuan gave a sly smile, "since I arrived here a month ago I have found no such master, and besides, the last time in Flowing Flame Sandland when you gave Yingyue Hall a few things and also some of my Healing Pills, they were clearly Pills that had been refined not long ago. So I boldly guessed Junior Brother Yang Kai is the one who refined them, and every single Pill was of exceptional quality; the one who made them is clearly not of a low rank."

This time Yang Kai did not deny it.

Daiyuan possessed such an odd talent; even if he denied it, it wouldn't help. At the same time he secretly relaxed — after all, that sort of ability probably belonged only to Daiyuan; others could not deduce from those clues that he was an Origin-Grade alchemist.

Daiyuan also seemed like someone trustworthy, so Yang Kai did not worry she would betray him.

With that thought he felt somewhat at ease and smiled kindly. "Miss Daiyuan, if you first need to confirm my identity as an alchemist, are you asking me to refine Pills for you?"

That was the only guess he could make, and if it were true everything would make sense.

Unexpectedly, Daiyuan slowly shook her head. "Not to refine Pills, but it is indeed related to alchemy — otherwise I wouldn't have come here."

Yang Kai smiled faintly. "Although I don't know what you want me to do, there should be more than one person on Dark Star who can help you. To be honest, I'm only an Origin-Grade Lower-Level alchemist now. Judging from your status within Liuli Gate, Miss Daiyuan, surely there must be Origin-Grade alchemists in Liuli Gate? And even if Liuli Gate lacks one, why not ask the masters of the Medicine Pill Sect? Each of them has attainments in alchemy far beyond me."

He had learned before that the Medicine Pill Sect had five Origin-Grade alchemists, every one of them revered and influential. Besides, Liuli Gate was a large sect — it couldn't possibly have none of that rank; at the very least there would be one.

Yet she chose to come all the way to Dragon Lair Mountain to find him, which Yang Kai found very strange.

"If it were possible, why would I come to trouble Junior Brother?" Daiyuan's face showed a bitter smile. "Liuli Gate does indeed have Master Xiao who is an Origin-Grade alchemist, but I am rather constrained by certain difficulties and cannot ask Master Xiao to intervene."

"Master Xiao..." Yang Kai raised an eyebrow; an amiable face surfaced in his memory, bringing to mind Xiao Fusheng from Yao Wang Valley — he didn't expect this alchemist in Liuli Gate to also be surnamed Xiao.

"As for those seniors from the Medicine Pill Sect..." Daiyuan's brows knit. "For the same reasons as Master Xiao, I cannot ask four of them. The remaining one would be a suitable candidate, but the price demanded is too high, and I lack the means to offer it."

Yang Kai stared at her in astonishment.

This woman's realm and methods were not weak; he had assumed she would be much respected and cultivated within Liuli Gate, but her words carried an abnormal undertone.

She did not seem to be as dominant inside Liuli Gate as he had imagined — not someone who could command wind and rain at will.

Thinking back to the valley on the Third Layer of Flowing Flame Sandland while waiting for the Red Candle Fruit to ripen, several nearby Liuli Gate disciples had clearly seen Daiyuan yet behaved strangely by not greeting her. From beginning to end she had acted alone, with no Liuli Gate disciples accompanying her; her treatment was worlds apart from Yin Sudie's. Suddenly Yang Kai felt he understood something.

"Therefore, the only person I could turn to is you, Junior Brother." Daiyuan suddenly looked up, pleadingly meeting Yang Kai's gaze; her star-bright eyes held a supplicating sincerity.

Yang Kai's heart stirred. After a moment's thought he asked, "Can you tell me exactly what you want me to do?"

Daiyuan bit her red lips and, embarrassed, said, "I really cannot disclose it before Junior Brother agrees."

Yang Kai's expression darkened; he was displeased. This woman had come to seek his help but spoke ambiguously. Even though he had a good impression of her, he was not about to gullibly agree to such a request.

Just as he was about to refuse, Daiyuan hurriedly added, "But I can guarantee it is absolutely within Junior Brother's ability, and it won't take you much time or expend great effort. If all goes smoothly, it will only take three days' work, and upon success I will reward you richly."

Yang Kai naturally cared little for her promised reward — if she couldn't even hire a Medicine Pill Sect elder she had nothing particularly valuable to offer. Yet if it would only take three days and little effort, he might consider it.

"However..." Daiyuan glanced at Yang Kai cautiously, as if lacking confidence in persuading him, and said weakly, "If Junior Brother agrees, you must return with me to Liuli Gate."

Yang Kai lifted his eyes to look at her. Daiyuan said nothing, merely lightly biting her thin lips as she awaited his reply.

After a moment, Yang Kai gave a faint smile. "Allow me to consider it. Dragon Lair Mountain has fine scenery — Miss Daiyuan, if you are idle you may stroll about as you please. As for your matter, I'll give you an answer in three days."

Daiyuan’s eyes dimmed slightly. She knew that Yang Kai not rejecting her outright was already giving her some face. His tone was full of polite evasion — how could Daiyuan possibly not hear it?

If he said he'd reply in three days, she feared she will be left waiting in vain.

She sighed softly, full of disappointment, yet forced a smile. "Then Miss Daiyuan will await Junior Brother Yang Kai's good news."

With that, Yang Kai took his leave from her and departed the pavilion.

After Yang Kai left, Daiyuan turned and ascended to the second floor, her brow heavy with worry. She knew she had perhaps asked too much — when one begs a favor one should speak plainly, but some things were truly difficult to voice, and she was at a loss.

She had intended to depart quietly at once so as not to embarrass Yang Kai should she be refused three days later, but for some inexplicable reason she remained behind and decided to wait the three days.

Perhaps a final sliver of hope still tugged at her heart.

Yang Kai left the pavilion in a sour mood and walked back. He had spared Daiyuan the immediate discomfort only because she had been the one to ask; had it been someone else he would not have bothered with pleasantries.

Returning to the original chamber, to Yang Kai's surprise Yang Yan and Wu Yi were still there, as if they had been waiting for his return, standing at the doorway like two striking figures.

He had expected them to gossip, but they asked nothing; they only watched him pass between them.

Once inside the chamber Yang Yan and Wu Yi followed. Yang Yan produced from somewhere a token identical to the one she'd given Yang Kai. After she fed a trace of Saint Yuan into it, a light shot forth from the token, and in the next moment the entire chamber seemed wrapped by an invisible barrier that cut off sound and sight and even suppressed Divine Sense.

"What are you doing?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

Yang Yan came over with a cheerful smile, sat down on the chair right beside him, exchanged a glance with Wu Yi, and then asked, “You’re not planning to accept her request?”

Yang Kai was even more stunned. Looking between Yang Yan and Wu Yi, and seeing the flicker in their eyes, he immediately understood: "You were eavesdropping?"

Wu Yi's face flushed; she offered no protest, tacitly admitting it.

Yang Yan acted as if nothing were amiss. "What do you mean, eavesdropping? I was merely testing the power of a formation I've recently researched."

"What formation can do such a thing?" Yang Kai exclaimed in disbelief.

When he had been speaking with Daiyuan earlier, he had not noticed any sign that their conversation was being overheard. Yet now every word was known here; Yang Yan's array was positively extraordinary.

"You won't understand even if I explain — just use it." Yang Yan waved a small hand and produced a palm-sized, disk-shaped object. The disk was black, its material unknown, and when Yang Kai's Divine Sense swept across it he involuntarily made a small sound of surprise: he actually heard Daiyuan's faint sigh coming from the disk.

Apart from the sound there was no other response. It seemed the disk, together with the chamber's formation, was meant for listening in on voices.

Yang Kai could not tell when Yang Yan had set the thing up; she had most likely arranged it long ago and was merely waiting for an outsider to occupy the lodge so she could test the formation's effect.

Suddenly Yang Kai's expression shifted as he stared at Yang Yan. "There isn't such a thing in my stone manor, is there?"

"No!" Yang Yan denied at once, shaking her head vigorously. "Why would I set something up in your place?"

Yang Kai lightly nodded in satisfaction, then his face turned stern as he scolded, "What sort of conduct is this! Don't pull such low, despicable tricks again. If someone uncovers it, I wonder what end you'll meet!"

Yang Yan and Wu Yi exchanged a glance and stuck out their tongues.

Yang Kai shifted his tone and continued, "But since you've already heard it, you should understand I won't agree to such a thing. Yet from your looks it seems you hold a different opinion."
