## Chapter 796 — Nine Techniques Perfected

Whenever a Sacred Land's chosen Saint entered the Sacred Tomb to undergo the trial, it was a momentous affair, and the event was carefully recorded in the annals.

Xu Hui and the others were well aware of how much time such an undertaking would consume.

The quickest of them emerged from the Sacred Tomb in just fifteen days, while the slowest took only two months.

But Yang Kai had been inside the Sacred Tomb for four months with no sign of him emerging, and Xu Hui and the others began to wonder whether he had truly perished within.

The guardian elders heaved sighs of regret and lost patience with waiting; they held important posts and were tied up with daily affairs, they could not linger here indefinitely.

Even Xu Hui, who had presided over the matter, departed after four months.

Only An Ling'er remained, waiting outside the Sacred Tomb.

Three days after Yang Kai entered the Sacred Tomb, An Ling'er learned of the situation and hurried over to reproach Xu Hui and the others, though she had no power to change what had already taken place.

She had waited here for four months, yet even with eyes grown weary from staring, Yang Kai remained unseen.

One day the two beauties Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong arrived together; from a distance they spotted An Ling'er standing outside the Sacred Tomb and exchanged mournful sighs.

"The girl is still keeping watch here," Yu Ying murmured as she inhaled softly.

"Have we been too hasty? In sacrificing the Sacred Land's future, did we also bury the bright prospects of a young man?" Cheng Yuetong's pretty face flickered with guilt and dejection.

"It does no good to say that now—when the Grand Elder proposed it none of us objected, so we all share responsibility," Yu Ying said slowly. "Fortunately, the person she sent to deliver a letter to the Tianxiao Sect was intercepted by the Grand Elder. If Tianxiao Sect had learned of this, they would not have let the Sacred Land off easily."

"Indeed—such an outstanding young man would be highly cultivated by any sect," Cheng Yuetong replied, her expression tinged with unease.

The Nine Heavens Sacred Land currently faced troubles both outside and within; if they made enemies of the Tianxiao Sect they might be forced to seal the Nine Peaks and isolate themselves completely, and in that case even the next Saintess would be unable to go out and seek candidates.

"Have we overrated him, or has he been unlucky?" Yu Ying sighed. "In the past, chosen Saints entering the Sacred Tomb usually received some guidance from the old Saint, but this time he ventured in alone. It's a hard road for him…"

"Let's go take a look," Cheng Yuetong said, stepping forward.

After a short while the two arrived before the Sacred Tomb; hearing them, An Ling'er turned her head and, seeing them approach, nodded with a complicated expression as a signal of greeting.

An Ling'er had once been closest to these two elder women, but now she behaved with some coldness—she still cared about the fact that they had sent Yang Kai into the Sacred Tomb.

The three stood awkwardly, unsure how to offer comfort, staring at the bluestone before the tomb's entrance.

After a long moment Yu Ying said, "Ling'er, don't keep waiting. He probably won't be able to come out."

An Ling'er merely shook her head.

"Go back and rest. You've been here waiting for four months," Cheng Yuetong urged.

"He will come out," An Ling'er said suddenly, her tone firm and resolute.

Yu Ying and Cheng were stunned. Yu Ying forced a smile and asked, "How do you know? No chosen Saint has ever spent so long in the Sacred Tomb and come out unharmed."

An Ling'er's expression turned proud. "What others cannot do, he might well do. You haven't seen his true abilities; of course you'd think that. I believe he will come out."

The two women brightened, then cautiously asked, "What exactly can he do that makes you view him so differently?"

Though they acknowledged Yang Kai's uncommon aptitude and considerable strength, neither had seen him in action, and so they did not truly understand his depths; An Ling'er, however, had spent much time with him and knew more of his background.

The two became curious and wanted to glean what they could from her.

"I don't know all the details, but he always surprises people," An Ling'er answered. "He once said that even without joining our Sacred Land, within thirty years he could stand on equal footing with the old Saint."

"On equal footing?" Yu Ying and Cheng exclaimed in astonishment. "That would mean top-tier cultivation at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm."

An Ling'er nodded solemnly.

Yu Ying pursed her lips and smiled. "He's only at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm now. To claim he'll reach the Third Stage of the Saint Realm in thirty years seems unlikely."

"Yes—there aren't many Third Stage masters on this entire continent," Cheng said with a smile; both women clearly thought Yang Kai was boasting.

Both had come through those ranks and knew how difficult it was to advance beyond the Transcendent Realm. Their own talents were exceptional by continental standards; otherwise they would not have reached the Saint Realm.

Even if Yang Kai were superior to them, achieving something so impossible seemed beyond him.

Who among the Third Stage masters had not lived for several centuries? Even if they appeared young, each had weathered the passage of time; their current heights were won through years of tempering.

Yang Kai seemed barely in his twenties; to claim he'd reach such a height in thirty years implied that by fifty he would stand at the pinnacle of this world.

Centuries-old Saint Realm cultivators were already rare; someone in their fifties at the Third Stage was simply inconceivable.

Youthful arrogance. Yu Ying and Cheng smiled tightly, thinking Yang Kai presumptuous.

"Why are you laughing?" An Ling'er asked angrily. "He said he could, so he can—wait and see, in thirty years he'll be at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm."

"Let's see him come out first," Yu Ying said with a frown, glancing at An Ling'er with concern. Then, hesitating, she added, "Ling'er, are you very fond of him? Otherwise why would you speak for him so ardently?"

An Ling'er's face flushed and she felt embarrassed.

"I don't dislike him…" After a pause she murmured, "I feel guilty for the harm my actions caused him. If I hadn't had him comprehend the Nine Heavens Divine Technique, he wouldn't have suffered this misfortune or been driven into the Sacred Tomb. He should have had a better future…"

"This was our decision; it has nothing to do with you," Yu Ying said with a sigh, taking on the weight of responsibility.

"Elders, may I discuss something with you?" An Ling'er said, lifting her head with sudden solemnity.

"Speak," Yu Ying and Cheng nodded.

"If… if he can come out of the Sacred Tomb, could you allow him to leave? He does not seem suited to being bound here." An Ling'er smiled bitterly. "To others, the lordship of the Sacred Land is an enormous temptation, but for him it would be a shackle. Forcing him to stay here does him no good; you would not want a Saint who has no concern for the Sacred Land, would you?"

The two women furrowed their brows and exchanged uneasy looks; they could not answer lightly.

"You think he won't come out? Then simply treat him as if he died. The dead cannot divulge the Sacred Land's secrets, so promising this would be of no consequence," An Ling'er said.

"This… we'd have to discuss it with the Grand Elder," Yu Ying said with a forced smile. "We are not in a position to decide."

A loud, resonant voice cut in from the side. A rainbow of light shimmered and the Grand Elder Xu Hui suddenly appeared before the Sacred Tomb.

"Grand Elder!" Yu Ying and Cheng Yuetong bowed hastily.

Xu Hui inclined his head slightly and said to An Ling'er, "Your Highness the Saintess, what you just proposed I can decide and agree to."

An Ling'er's face lit up with joy.

"Yes—with Elder Yu and Elder Cheng here as witnesses," Xu Hui said gravely. "Of course, the condition is that he actually emerges, and that he truly refuses the lordship of the Sacred Land."

"He most likely would refuse," An Ling'er said.

"One cannot be certain…" Xu Hui smiled with inscrutable depth. "Perhaps when he comes out, he will, of his own accord, ask to inherit the position. No chosen Saint has ever entered the Sacred Tomb and then come out without thinking of the Sacred Land."

Yu Ying and Cheng brightened as well and smiled.

Though no one knew the exact mysteries hidden within the Sacred Tomb, it was true that those who entered and later emerged came to regard the place as their home and gave themselves wholeheartedly to the Sacred Land—even if they had ties to their sects or families.

"You think he can come out?" An Ling'er's eyes shone with hope.

"I hope so…" Xu Hui shook his head slowly. "But I see no sign of hope."

"Wait and see; he will astonish you all!" An Ling'er clenched her fist lightly.

The three of them stared at her, puzzled by where she drew such confidence that Yang Kai, who had been in the Sacred Tomb for more than four months, could return safely.

......

Inside the Sacred Tomb Yang Kai let out a light breath, and a subtle, exquisite energy erupted from his Sea of Consciousness, striking the last floating mass of energy before him.

With a crisp crack, that final cluster—containing the essence and conception of the last move of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique—shattered, and all its wonders poured into Yang Kai's mind, allowing him to fully fathom the final strike.

Profound Heaven Sword, Nether Heaven Lock, Supreme Heaven Draw, Heaven-Encompassing Net, Heaven-Covering Palm, Heaven-Slaying Spear, Vast Heaven Shield, Fleeting Heaven Shadow, Crimson Heaven Arrow…

The Nine Heavens Divine Technique revolved in Yang Kai's mind, familiar yet wondrous; these nine spells were far more extraordinary than any Martial Skill or Soul Technique he had ever encountered.

Months of comprehension and study had not only made Yang Kai proficient in the nine moves, they had also greatly aided the condensation of his True Yuan—making it denser and purer.

The area's Spiritual Qi was exceptionally rich; these months of cultivation had not only enabled him to master the Nine Heavens Divine Technique but had also significantly advanced his cultivation.
