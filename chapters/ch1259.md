## Chapter 1259 — Inventorying the Spoils

A three-foot-long piece of bone, the thickness of a baby's arm, like a pillar of jade—clearly no ordinary item—alongside a pigeon-egg-sized spherical pearl; the pearl was colorless, yet inside a small emerald-green snake swam, as if it were alive.

A very faint soul ripple emanated from that emerald snake, yet it carried an intense air of majesty.

The moment that round pearl appeared, a high, resonant draconic cry sounded faintly within Yang Kai, and at the same time a different kind of pressure spread out from him.

Yang Yan looked up in shock, staring at Yang Kai with surprise, but soon her attention was drawn to the fragment of white bone and the round pearl before her.

Studying them closely, her expression shifted; her beautiful eyes flashed with extremely complex emotions—at times delighted, at times suspicious, at times astonished...

After a long moment she inhaled deeply, lifted her gaze, and looked straight at Yang Kai.

"Can you tell what these two things are?" Yang Kai felt his lips dry; even though he had obtained and kept them in his Spatial Ring for some time, taking them out still stirred a strange excitement.

"Your luck is truly astonishing—you managed to get a Dragon Bone and a Dragon Pearl; I have no idea what places you visited in the Flowing Flame Sandland." Yang Yan bit her red lip; it was clear she, too, was overjoyed, though she restrained her emotions.

"They really are Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl?" Yang Kai's face lit up with joy. He had harbored doubts when he first found them in the Saint Crystal vein, but once Yang Yan confirmed it, he still found it hard to believe.

"There's no doubt—they are indeed a Dragon Bone and a Dragon Pearl!"

Yang Kai couldn't help but grin broadly. He felt exhilarated. Yang Yan seemed genuinely happy for him as well, smiling foolishly at his good fortune.

After a while, when Yang Kai had calmed, Yang Yan's smile faded and she asked, "How do you plan to handle them?"

"Can they be forged into a Secret Treasure? I happen to be lacking an offensive Secret Treasure!" Yang Kai had long considered the possibility and asked at once. Ordinary offensive treasures left him unimpressed; even Origin-Grade Upper-Level artifacts might not match the power he could unleash, and Void King-Grade Secret Treasures were beyond his ability to fully trigger. But with a Dragon Bone and a Dragon Pearl, if forged into an offensive Secret Treasure, his combat strength could rise further.

The Hundred Mountains Painting is fine, but when Yang Kai used it he never felt completely at ease.

"Impossible!" To Yang Kai's surprise, the seemingly omnipotent Yang Yan slowly shook her head when he asked.

This left Yang Kai, who had been full of expectation, looking instantly disappointed.

"I'm not saying I can't refine it—only that if I did, its value would be greatly diminished."

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai frowned and asked.

"Dragon Bone is the bone of a true dragon. It inherently contains extraordinary power and mystical function. Judging from the hue of the dragon soul within this Dragon Pearl, this fragment should be the bone of a wood-attributed true dragon. I don't know exactly what powers it conceals, but it's already a remarkable Secret Treasure. If I were to refine it, my aura would inevitably taint it, and when you used it you couldn't unleash its full might. Of course, if I were an Void King-Grade Upper-Level artificer, I wouldn't have these worries, but with my current level it's difficult to properly refine it; I couldn't fully assimilate it!"

"Then what should be done?" Yang Kai's fervor was doused like a bucket of cold water; he calmed in an instant. "Wait until you become a Void King-Grade Upper-Level artificer to refine it?"

Yang Yan frowned and didn't answer at once, as if she were pondering something.

After a while her eyes brightened. She smiled at Yang Kai: "Your Saint Yuan is Yang attribute, isn't it?"

"Not really now, but it used to be." Yang Kai shook his head slowly. Since his Saint Yuan had transformed, the Demonic Flame's attribute defied fixed definition—volatile and strange—so Yang Yan's question stumped him.

“Circulate your Saint Yuan and let me see,” Yang Yan instructed, her beautiful eyes fixed intently on him without blinking.

Yang Kai promptly stirred his Saint Yuan and converted the Demonic Flame into an extreme heat attribute.

Yang Yan's eyes lit up and she clapped laughing: "No problem. It seems your luck is really good. If someone else had obtained a Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl they might have to wait until I reached Void King-Grade Upper-Level to refine them, but if your Saint Yuan is this intensely hot, you can refine them yourself."

"Refine them myself?" Yang Kai was startled.

"Yes—refine them yourself. That has great advantages. At your current strength you can't completely assimilate them or draw out all their power, but over time as your strength grows, the Dragon Bone's manifested power will increase. In time it could even become a Secret Treasure intimately linked to your soul and life." Yang Yan explained excitedly.

"But I'm not an artificer—how could I refine it?" Yang Kai remained puzzled.

"You don't need to be an artificer, because it's already a Secret Treasure; you don't need to forge anything. You only need to perform a sacrificial refining. I'll teach you the method—no problem."

"That's possible?" Yang Kai rejoiced, suddenly invigorated.

"Yes, and you also obtained the Dragon Pearl containing the dragon soul. If you can also assimilate the Dragon Pearl into the Dragon Bone, hehe... I can't imagine what that bone will become." Yang Yan's bright eyes showed a hint of madness; she was eager to see the Dragon Bone after refinement.

Without hesitation she transmitted the sacrificial refining method to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai listened carefully, pondering every detail, asking immediately about any uncertainties; Yang Yan patiently explained.

The refining method wasn't difficult. Yang Kai memorized it within two hours, only waiting for time to practice and fully comprehend it before attempting to refine the Dragon Bone.

After teaching Yang Kai the technique, Yang Yan thought a moment and said, "If you're not in a hurry, I'll lend you my refining furnace. Mine isn't great, but with its assistance the process will be faster—measure twice, cut once."

"A refining furnace?" Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, showing a strange look. "I have one."

"You have a refining furnace?" Yang Yan was startled, then laughed: "You're not an artificer—how would you have a refining furnace?"

"Oh—got it in the Flowing Flame Sandland, and it seems rather special." Yang Kai said as he took out the small refining furnace.

When Yang Yan saw the small furnace she wasn't overly surprised at first, only finding the strange bird pattern on it curious. As she examined the furnace's quality, the bird pattern seemed to come alive, rippling across the surface of the vessel, then instantly transforming into a scarlet Fire Bird that flew out.

In an instant the chamber's temperature soared, and the air filled with scorching, pure fire Spiritual Qi.

"An Artifact Spirit!" Yang Yan cried out, covering her mouth, her gaze fixed on the spirit with shock and a keen eagerness to try it out.

The Artifact Spirit seemed to sense Yang Yan's covetousness. After circling in midair it alighted on Yang Kai's shoulder, three long tail feathers trailing behind. With its sharp beak preening its plumage, it watched Yang Yan with two small alert eyes, appearing extremely lively.

Yang Yan was too stunned to speak; her eyes filled with longing.

She suddenly realized how much of a loss it was that Yang Kai didn't become an artificer.

His Saint Yuan was appropriate, his Divine Sense strong, and he even had a Stone Puppet—the artificer's best assistant—and now he possessed a refining furnace with an Artifact Spirit; that furnace looked to be of Void King-Grade quality...

Infuriating!

Comparing what Yang Kai had with her own possessions, Yang Yan inexplicably grew despondent.

The Artifact Spirit had clearly been tamed by Yang Kai; even if she wanted that furnace, she couldn't obtain it—once an Artifact Spirit is tamed it will never submit to a second master unless the original tamer dies.

"With that refining furnace to assist you, refining the Dragon Bone, Dragon Pearl, and dragon soul will be twice as effective." Yang Yan said sourly, her beautiful eyes full of grievance as she looked at Yang Kai.

"Cough... I collected quite a few refining furnaces on this trip, several of them Void King-Grade."

"Really?" Yang Yan immediately perked up.

"Yes, but they all seem somewhat damaged." Yang Kai said as he took out the furnaces he had collected from the Earth-Lung Fire Pool, spreading them in a scattered pile.

Yang Yan's mouth dropped wide open and she couldn't close it for some time. After inspecting them one by one she grew angry: "It's not just a little damage—it's severe. How are they all burned through by fire-attributed spiritual power!?"

"Are they still usable?"

"I don't know. I'll try to repair them." Yang Yan waved her hand and stored the furnaces into the Spatial Ring.

Next, Yang Kai took out the other spoils he had gathered in the Flowing Flame Sandland and handed everything he could to Yang Yan.

For example, the large quantity of Crystal Stone, a Fire-Glow Crystal Core, and a Flowing Flame Fireblaze.

Yang Kai had collected nine Flowing Flame Fireblazes in total. After giving one to Yang Yan he kept eight himself; he was eager to see if using them could enhance his Divine Sense Fire.

The fragment of the torn map taken from Meng Hongliang was also given to Yang Yan. Now she had two map fragments; though incomplete, together they might yield something to study.

The crystal obtained in the Sixth Layer that caused Yang Kai to hallucinate and become dizzy was recognized by Yang Yan; she said it was a rare treasure called a Mirage Stone and took it, claiming it was the best material for arranging illusion formations.

She also accepted the twenty lengths of emerald bamboo that Yang Kai had spent half a year cutting down, leaving her to figure out how to refine them herself.
