## Chapter 2178 — Peerless Spirit Rhinoceros Technique

Ever since entering the Four Seasons Land, Yang Kai had been called trash more than once…

No wonder — he dressed plainly, bore no marks of any great Sect, and his cultivation was only at the lowly First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Naturally, these elite disciples from various Sects and families looked down on him!

In the Four Seasons Land, being at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm placed one firmly at the bottom of the heap! Unless you had a background like Lan Xun, no one would spare you a second glance.

Bao Peng certainly didn’t take Yang Kai seriously.

Faced with his question, Yang Kai tilted his head and thought for a moment, then said, “I’m just lucky…?”

“I already told you, it’s not just luck—you really are courting death!” Bao Peng sneered, his expression turning vicious. Having his plans ruined by Yang Kai, he was now seething with anger, wishing he could tear Yang Kai to pieces to vent his hatred.

"Mind your own business. As for this Spiritual Medicine… I’ll take it first!" Cheng Tai suddenly shouted, stampeed his feet, and charged toward the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus.

The two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect were startled by his shout. By the time they tried to stop him, it was already too late—they could only grit their teeth and give chase.

Bao Peng clearly had no intention of continuing to tangle with Yang Kai either. He also flickered forward, heading for the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus.

Everyone just wanted to seize the Spiritual Medicine as soon as possible.

In a flash of light, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly appeared in front of the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, blocking the four from advancing. He looked at them helplessly and said, “Everyone, this Spiritual Medicine isn’t ripe yet. Now isn’t the best time to pick it. If you act rashly, you might ruin this rare treasure. Why not sit down and talk it over, and wait for the Spiritual Medicine to mature?”

“Hmph, what nonsense! Get out of the way!” Cheng Tai was unmoved and shouted in a deep voice.

“Please cooperate, everyone!” Yang Kai looked at him sincerely.

“And if I refuse…?”

In just a few words, Cheng Tai had already charged close to Yang Kai, swinging a fist wrapped in wild energy at him. Judging by his posture, he wasn’t holding back at all—he meant to kill Yang Kai with a single blow.

He sneered, “Ignorant fool. If you die, don’t blame anyone!”

“There’s no helping it…” Yang Kai muttered softly. As he spoke, his previously calm face suddenly twisted into a sinister grin, looking terrifying. He shouted, “If you won’t listen to reason, then I’ll give you something you can understand!”

As he finished, a flash of light appeared in his palm, and an Imperial Treasure materialized.

Imperial Might surged forth as Yang Kai swept his sword in a wide arc, slashing toward them. He chanted, “One sword sweeps a million; one man holds the pass!”

Sss sss sss sss…

Sword energy burst forth, sweeping the land. Centered on Yang Kai, the unstoppable Sword Qi fanned out in a terrifying arc, and a shocking pressure descended, bringing the breath of death.

“What!” Cheng Tai’s face changed dramatically. Just a moment ago, he had been sneering, but in the next instant, his eyes bulged as if he’d seen a ghost, staring fixedly ahead.

“Imperial Might… That’s Imperial Might… That’s an Imperial Treasure!” Bao Peng also cried out in shock, quickly forming a seal and once again using the Five Aggregates Sect’s secret technique—Golden Cicada Shell Escape. A lifelike afterimage appeared where he had stood, while he dodged away at the last possible moment.

The fellow disciples from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect also couldn’t believe their eyes. When the Myriad Sword Imperial Treasure appeared, the Dao Origin-Grade Secret Treasure swords in their hands wailed uncontrollably, as if transmitting fear.

And when Bao Peng shouted, the two instantly turned pale…

Still, having trained together for years, the two instantly formed a seal with one hand and gripped their swords with the other, sending out waves of sword light. After barely blocking the attack, they desperately dodged to the side, narrowly escaping disaster.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh…

Sword energy crisscrossed, energy surged.

After the flash of light, the four who had charged toward the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus were scattered in three directions, each wearing a pale face and clearly shaken.

Bao Peng showed no signs of injury, but the shock on his face revealed his inner turmoil.

The two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect were also unharmed, but their sword hands trembled slightly.

Cheng Tai wasn’t so lucky. He had borne the brunt of the attack and, although he tried to defend himself, he couldn’t fully withstand the Imperial Treasure’s blow. Seven or eight wounds bled across his body, leaving him miserable.

“Now… can we talk?” Yang Kai twirled his sword and smiled at the four before him.

Cheng Tai and the others all wore grim expressions, staring at him warily.

They had thought he was just trash, but suddenly he produced an Imperial Treasure coveted by all, and unleashed a terrifying sword technique that seriously injured the strongest person present. If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, no one would have believed it.

“Who… are you, really?” Cheng Tai gritted his teeth against the pain and asked Yang Kai in a deep voice.

By now, he knew Yang Kai must have a powerful background. Otherwise, how could someone at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm possess an Imperial Treasure? The thought made him extremely wary…

Even if he could still defeat Yang Kai, he had to worry about retaliation from whatever force stood behind him. His own Qu Tian Sect wasn’t a major Sect—just about equal to Fei Sheng Palace. How could he afford to provoke a truly powerful force?

“Friend, it was all a misunderstanding just now. I hope you won’t take it to heart!” Bao Peng suddenly put on a flattering smile and said.

“If it was just a misunderstanding, then there’s no need for any further explanation.” Yang Kai glanced at him lazily, a faint, ambiguous smile playing at his lips.

Bao Peng, as if pardoned, cupped his fists. “Thank you, friend. I have urgent matters, so I won’t disturb you further. Farewell!”

With that, he really turned and left, moving with incredible speed.

Watching his retreating figure, Yang Kai looked thoughtful, secretly feeling that if this man didn’t die young, he would surely accomplish great things. His decisiveness showed he had an instinctive grasp of the situation.

He knew staying any longer would bring no benefit and might invite danger, so he left without hesitation.

Compared to Bao Peng, Cheng Tai and the two from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect seemed indecisive.

Even after witnessing Yang Kai’s power, the three still didn’t leave, as if clinging to some vague hope that their luck would be heaven-defying and they could obtain the Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus.

As for Cheng Tai, he was heavily wounded and deeply wary of the mysterious force he imagined stood behind Yang Kai. He looked torn, clearly wanting to leave but unable to let go of his lingering hopes.

But the Senior Brother from Flowing Shadow Sword Sect was filled with greed.

At this moment, his gaze lingered more on the Myriad Sword in Yang Kai’s hand!

After all, compared to the unknown Supreme Mystic Treasure Lotus, the Myriad Sword was a genuine Imperial Treasure—and a sword-type Imperial Treasure at that!

Flowing Shadow Sword Sect was famous for its swordsmanship, and its disciples mostly cultivated sword techniques. If he could obtain the Myriad Sword, his own strength would soar.

This set all manner of thoughts aflame in his mind…

“Aren’t you leaving?” Yang Kai looked at them with a half-smile.

Cheng Tai pressed his dry lips together, standing still but showing no hostility, only quietly circulating Origin Qi to suppress his worsening injuries.

But when the Senior Brother heard this, he suddenly glanced at the woman. Their eyes met, and everything was understood without words.

Suddenly, a powerful aura surged from both of them, merging together and causing their Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation to soar.

Their black hair fluttered without wind, robes billowed, and their fighting spirit filled the world.

Senior Brother extended a hand, and the woman placed her soft palm in his as if their minds were one.

The instant their bodies touched, their already strong aura climbed even higher, and a visible halo of energy shot skyward like a pillar.

In that moment, the two seemed to become one, inseparable!

“Peerless Spirit Rhinoceros Technique!” Cheng Tai exclaimed, his face turning extremely grave.

Hearing this, Yang Kai immediately understood that the Peerless Spirit Rhinoceros Technique must be a dual cultivation secret art of Flowing Shadow Sword Sect. Once activated, as seen now, it allowed a man and woman’s auras to merge, greatly boosting their strength for a short time!

After using this secret art, Senior Brother’s entire demeanor changed, becoming extremely confident and arrogant.

He held his sword and slowly drew a circle before him, his gaze cold as he looked at Yang Kai. “Hand over your Imperial Treasure, and I’ll spare your life!”

As he spoke, the woman made the same gesture.

Where their sword tips traced, a visible sword halo appeared. When their words fell, the two half-circles suddenly merged into one, forming a circular sword seal. The sword seal rang out, seemingly containing immense power.

“Are you sure you want to do this?” Yang Kai remained unmoved, standing calmly and gazing at them with clear eyes.

“Enough talk!” Senior Brother snapped impatiently.

“And if I refuse?”

“Then you can die!” Senior Brother said coldly, his sword drifting forward with a casual flourish.

As the sword pointed out, it stirred the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth into a frenzy. The circular sword seal buzzed and shot forward.

Midway, the sword seal split into two, then four, then eight…

In an instant, the sky was filled with these circular sword seals, covering a vast expanse and making escape seem impossible.
