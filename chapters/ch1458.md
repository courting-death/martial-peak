## Chapter 1458 — Shan Qingluo's Experiences

“Miss Shen, please help calm her down, she seems a bit unstable,” Yang Kai called to the side, afraid Biluo would regain strength and slap him again — after all, he was now the head of a sect; being slapped in the face publicly would be a disgrace.

“Oh.” Shen Shitao responded and hurried over, sitting beside Biluo and letting the weakened woman lean against her, soothing her with gentle words.

Yang Kai rose and exchanged a few words with Mo Yu and Gu Zhen, learning that after they used the Space Array on that jade platform to enter the Imperial Garden they had not stayed together; they had simply been lucky and were not too far apart, so they regrouped after a short time.

As for the others’ whereabouts, they did not know.

“Is that so?” Yang Kai nodded lightly after hearing their explanation, showing no sign of disappointment. He had only wanted to inquire about Yang Yan and Ye Xijun’s situation—since there was no news, so be it. After all, with Ye Xijun by her side, Yang Yan should be in no real danger.

Turning his head to look at Biluo, Yang Kai couldn’t help twitching the corner of his mouth.

At this moment Biluo had almost buried her face in Shen Shitao’s ample twin peaks; whether intentional or not, the woman’s mouth was pressed against one cherry-like spot, and the warm breath when she inhaled made Shen Shitao’s pretty face flush with embarrassment. Though itching all over and deeply uncomfortable, Shen Shitao refrained from saying anything out of consideration for Biluo’s severe injuries and forced herself to endure it.

Worse still, Biluo kept holding Shen Shitao’s jade hand, continually rubbing and fondling it as if playing with some novel toy.

Yang Kai’s face went black.

That woman really was Biluo. As the saying goes, wolves roam the world and eat meat; dogs roam the world and eat filth! Biluo had these vile habits in earlier years — thirty years apart and she was still the same. A person’s inclinations are not so easily changed.

Seeing Shen Shitao so distressed, Yang Kai could no longer stand it and strode over, grabbing Biluo by the collar and lifting her up.

Biluo glared at him viciously. She seemed to want to say something, but the movement tugged at her wounds and she began coughing incessantly.

“Sect Master Yang, what do you intend to do next? If you don’t mind, why not join me and Elder Mo Yu?” Gu Zhen asked Yang Kai with genuine earnestness. The dangers within the Imperial Garden had exceeded his expectations — it wasn’t just the seals and array traps; there were threats from other cultivators within the Star Domain, and another person would always add strength.

Especially Yang Kai; they knew his background, and although his cultivations was only First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, his performance in the recent battle had been striking.

Gu Zhen hoped to join forces with Yang Kai to explore the place together.

Yang Kai pondered for a moment and slowly shook his head. “Sect Master Gu’s kindness is appreciated, but if it were only me, teaming up would be no problem; however, now…”

Saying that, he glanced at Biluo.

This woman had just returned from the gates of death and was a burden now. How could Yang Kai bear to let her slow down Gu Zhen and Mo Yu? Leaving Biluo behind was impossible either — he still had many questions to ask.

Moreover, the things he sought to accomplish were not matters he could reveal to outsiders.

“If that is so, then I won’t force the matter.” Gu Zhen clearly understood Yang Kai’s concerns and said no more. Honestly, he and Mo Yu were already struggling to care for Shen Shitao; adding Biluo to the group would make the journey full of obstacles. He smiled faintly and continued, “I actually planned to explore here for a few more days and then leave. If Sect Master Yang feels unable to continue, it’s best to withdraw early. I’ve heard there are many opportunities and benefits outside the Imperial Garden as well.”

“I will remember that.” Yang Kai nodded lightly, then as if recalling something he asked, “By the way, you’ve been here more than ten days — did you find an extremely cold Ice Path anywhere?”

“An Ice Path?” Gu Zhen and Mo Yu exchanged a look and both shook their heads slowly. “We didn’t find such a place.”

“Never mind, I was just asking casually.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Although curious why Yang Kai inquired about the Ice Path, Gu Zhen and Mo Yu didn’t press; after a few polite words the Qiantian Sect group took their leave.

Before leaving, Shen Shitao cast a wary glance at Biluo. When she noticed Biluo smiling sweetly at her, she couldn’t help but shiver—clearly, the woman had left a shadow in her heart.

After the three from Qiantian Sect left, Yang Kai looked at Biluo with a complex expression and fell silent for a long moment before asking, “Can you move?”

“I need to rest a while longer,” Biluo said, her complexion a little pale.

“Alright, I have some questions to ask, so we’ll stay here for a bit.”

The two found a corner in the palace to rest and talk.

Yang Kai was naturally curious why Biluo was here, where Shan Qingluo was, and where they had gone after leaving Cangyun Evil Land all those years ago.

Biluo answered without the slightest concealment.

The story was absurd: after Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo parted ways, Shan Qingluo set out for Tongxuan Continent, and two or three years later Shan Qingluo brought Biluo searching for Yang Kai’s traces.

Although Yang Kai had previously said that finding a Void Passage could lead one to another world, Shan Qingluo scoured the land and seas but couldn’t succeed. She found several Void Passages, but none led to the Tongxuan Continent; some were unstable and unusable, others only transmitted for short distances.

Three years later they returned to Cangyun Evil Land. The Enchantress Queen, pained by love, grew melancholic and ill from longing. This was the sorrow of the Poison Widow Lineage — Shan Qingluo’s mother and grandmother had the same affliction; once one possessed this constitution it was unavoidable.

But Shan Qingluo differed from them: they mourned the dead, those who had died by their hands; Shan Qingluo mourned the living.

One day Shan Qingluo took Biluo to the Spider Mother’s Nest merely to reminisce; after all, it was where she and Yang Kai had once been captured by the Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast Spider Mother and had shared life and death together, and it was during that time they had become acquainted — Yang Kai had inadvertently planted a seed of affection in her heart.

For reminiscing there was no place more suitable.

After the Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast Spider Mother had been slain by Yang Kai, the Spider Mother’s Nest was left undisturbed. But when Shan Qingluo entered she discovered an ancient sacrifice altar there, from which a faint calling issued; the Enchantress Queen could not resist and slit her wrist, pouring her own blood into the altar.

In an instant the altar flared with light and enveloped her and Biluo.

When they regained consciousness they found themselves in another place.

Overjoyed, she thought she had arrived at the new world Yang Kai had spoken of. But her joy turned to sorrow when she saw across from her a huge silver spider awaiting them; the two were terrified, certain they would perish.

Yet upon closer inspection they discovered that the spider, cast in silver and imposing, towering a hundred zhang, had long been dead — merely a corpse with no trace of life.

What puzzled Shan Qingluo most was that she felt a subtle connection with the giant spider: when she practiced her arts she could absorb some strange energy from the spider’s corpse.

That energy not only transformed her Poison Widow constitution but also improved her aptitude, allowing her cultivation to climb rapidly.

Surviving great peril brings great reward! Shan Qingluo, a true queen of seduction, recognized this supreme opportunity and did not leave; she cultivated there.

Years later, when the giant spider’s corpse had turned to powder and she had absorbed all of the mysterious power within, the Enchantress Queen’s strength leapt from Second Stage of the Saint Realm to First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm.

Biluo benefited greatly there as well. Although she could not absorb the spider’s inner energy like Shan Qingluo, the surrounding energy granted her some advantage.

Only then did the two leave that strange place.

After some inquiry they learned they had arrived within a Star Domain, stepping down upon a cultivation star.

The Yao Star, Di Chen!

On that cultivation star ninety percent of life were demonic beasts and yao; the territory was vast. There were some humans and demonic clans or other races, but they were extremely rare and lived in poor conditions; Di Chen was dominated by yao.

Later, the pair wandered on Di Chen for a time and by chance were noticed by one of the Ten Lords, Chi Yue, who took Shan Qingluo as an adopted daughter. This gave them a stable dwelling and ended their wandering. As one of the Ten Lords on Di Chen, Chi Yue herself was a Void King Realm expert; as her adopted daughter, Shan Qingluo’s status was exalted — second only to one, and above all others.

Hearing Biluo’s account, Yang Kai was stunned.

His own years had been full of varied experiences, yet Shan Qingluo and Biluo’s ordeals were no less remarkable; in terms of luck they were far better off than he, spared from so many of the mortal dangers he had gone through.

He had reached the Star Domain step by step using the Tongxuan Continent as a transit.

But the two had reached the Star Domain through a single altar.

“Chi Yue is a Void King Realm expert and one of the Ten Lords — why would she favor Qingluo and take her as an adopted daughter?” Yang Kai puzzled; after all, Chi Yue was a yao while Shan Qingluo was human, and the two were hardly likely to be close.

Yang Kai instinctively suspected ill intent.
