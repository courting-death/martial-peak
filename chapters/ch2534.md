## Chapter 2534 — Do You Have Anything Left to Say

This red-clothed young woman was clearly a pampered daughter of some great force, spoiled and raised in luxury. Although her strength was considerable, her actual combat experience was pitifully lacking. Now, in her anger, her attacks were even more chaotic, swinging her soft whip wildly without any technique, unable to bring out her full power at all.

Although Zhang Ruoxi had not participated in many fights either, during those twenty-odd days in the Ziyue City, she had fought life-and-death battles on the arena every day. Naturally, her experience far surpassed that of the red-clothed girl.

So as soon as the two exchanged blows, the situation became completely one-sided, with the red-clothed girl utterly suppressed.

Bang, bang, bang…

Explosive sounds rang out continuously as Zhang Ruoxi’s hands turned into afterimages, striking the red-clothed girl again and again. Each blow sent her staggering backward, while her own attacks were easily dodged by Zhang Ruoxi.

Yet even after taking dozens of blows in an instant, the red-clothed girl was not injured in the slightest. Her fierce aura did not diminish at all, but this kind of fighting only made her angrier. She kept shrieking, her pretty face twisted, looking as if she wanted to eat her alive.

“Defensive Imperial Treasure!” Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed. He finally understood why the red-clothed girl hadn’t been hurt.

Every time Zhang Ruoxi’s attack landed, a faint light would flash across the red-clothed girl’s body, dissolving all of Zhang Ruoxi’s strikes and leaving her completely unharmed.

To have such powerful defensive ability, it could only be a Defensive Imperial Treasure.

That red-clothed girl was definitely wearing a treasure armor!

Imperial Treasures were rare, and Defensive Imperial Treasures were even more precious. To have one for protection, this red-clothed girl truly had an extraordinary background.

“I’ll kill you, kill you, kill you…” Although the red-clothed girl was uninjured, she was battered and disheveled by Zhang Ruoxi’s attacks, constantly retreating while shouting viciously.

But after a while, she realized she was no match for Zhang Ruoxi at all and immediately screamed, “Elder Fu, aren’t you going to step in and kill her?!”

Elder Fu was suffering in silence. He had just been countered by Yang Kai’s Divine Soul, and though his injuries weren’t serious, under Yang Kai’s watchful gaze, he didn’t dare act rashly. Hearing his Young Lady’s call, he could only grit his teeth and lunge at Zhang Ruoxi.

He had just started to move when Yang Kai appeared before him like a ghost, gently pushing a palm toward him and saying lightly, “Sir, let the little girls fight it out. There’s no honor in bullying the young.”

“Hiss…” Elder Fu sucked in a cold breath and shot backward. Yang Kai’s palm looked utterly ordinary, nothing special about it, but he felt a deadly sense of danger.

If that really landed, he figured he’d lose half his life on the spot.

Who was this brat? How could he be so strong? Elder Fu’s eyes were full of shock and uncertainty. Even though he wanted to save his mistress, he was powerless to do so.

Over there, Old Ban was shielding the little girl called Ling’er, having already retreated to the corner of the house. He held Ling’er tightly in his arms, staring at the fight inside with a face full of fear.

Although he had lived his whole life in the Desolate City, he was only a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivator. Now, with Ling’er to care for, he was naturally afraid of getting involved.

But now, in his own house, two young women were fighting fiercely, and two Emperors were facing off. He couldn’t help but feel dizzy.

Both groups seemed to have powerful backgrounds, none of them people he could afford to provoke. Though he was grateful to Yang Kai and Zhang Ruoxi for helping, he didn’t dare make a sound, only praying no one would die.

Bang, bang, bang, bang…

With both palms swinging, Zhang Ruoxi had already forced the red-clothed girl into a corner. She had nowhere left to retreat, and all her attacks were easily dodged by Zhang Ruoxi. She was like a sandbag, forced to passively endure Zhang Ruoxi’s blows.

Fortunately, her Defensive Imperial Treasure was extremely strong, and Zhang Ruoxi had no intent to kill. So, though she looked utterly miserable, her life was not in danger.

Still, being beaten like this was utterly humiliating. The red-clothed girl’s eyes turned red with grievance, though it was unclear if it was from anger or the urge to cry.

“Brat, tell your girl to stop right now and apologize to my Young Lady, or you’ll all die!” Elder Fu, cowed by Yang Kai, couldn’t save his mistress and could only shout angrily through gritted teeth.

“You dare threaten me?” Yang Kai snorted coldly, his gaze icy as he looked at Elder Fu, making the latter’s heart tremble and forcing him to swallow hard.

Elder Fu forced himself to calm down and shouted, “Do you know who my Young Lady is? She is—”

Before he could finish, Yang Kai turned his head and said, “Ruoxi, she’s wearing a Defensive Imperial Treasure. Hitting her like that is pointless.”

No one knew what power Yang Kai used, but Elder Fu suddenly felt a buzzing in his mind and couldn’t say another word.

“Defensive Imperial Treasure?” Zhang Ruoxi was suddenly enlightened. No wonder her attacks felt so strange, as if she were hitting cotton. So, just like herself, the other girl also had an Imperial Treasure for protection.

“Then what should I do?” Zhang Ruoxi stepped back and stopped attacking.

After that wild assault, the red-clothed girl’s heart was furious, but her face was pale. Anyone would be frightened after such a beating, even with an Imperial Treasure for protection.

At this moment, she looked at Zhang Ruoxi with eyes full of fear. Since childhood, no one had ever dared defy her. If she wanted the stars in the sky, someone would find a way to fetch them for her.

She had never been hit by anyone before.

But today, in this dilapidated stone house in Desolate City, she had been struck by Zhang Ruoxi more than a hundred times!

In this moment, she felt both terrified and furious toward Zhang Ruoxi, her hatred so intense she wanted nothing more than to kill her.

Hearing Zhang Ruoxi’s question, Yang Kai stroked his chin and said leisurely, “Imperial Treasures are powerful, but they can’t protect everything. Didn’t she just say she’d scratch your face?”

Zhang Ruoxi nodded, “Ruoxi understands!”

As she spoke, she looked coldly at the red-clothed girl, her beautiful eyes sweeping over the girl’s delicate face again and again.

“W-what are you doing?!” The red-clothed girl saw Zhang Ruoxi’s malicious gaze and was instantly filled with terror. She shouted while retreating, but the wall was right behind her—there was nowhere to go! Her soft whip had long since fallen to the ground.

Elder Fu was also shocked. From Yang Kai’s words, it sounded like the girl was about to hit his Young Lady’s face. If that really happened, with his Young Lady’s temper, who knew what would follow? The entire Eastern Territory might be shaken. He shouted, “Brat, listen up! My Young Lady comes from—”

“I’m not listening, I’m not listening!” Yang Kai shook his head like a rattle drum.

Elder Fu’s words were cut off again. He immediately understood that Yang Kai must have realized their extraordinary background and didn’t want to know the details, lest he be held back by them.

This was simply too shameless! Normally, just revealing his identity would make even the strongest enemies retreat in fear, but with Yang Kai, he couldn’t even finish a sentence. How could he announce their background?

Yang Kai snorted coldly and said, “Ruoxi, from now on, if anyone besides me dares utter a single word, just slap that girl’s face as hard as you can!”

“Alright!” Zhang Ruoxi naturally obeyed. Since Yang Kai said so, even if the Jade Emperor himself stood in front of her, she’d still slap him without hesitation.

“How dare you!” the red-clothed girl shouted.

Smack—a crisp sound rang out as the red-clothed girl’s head snapped to the side, a bright red handprint appearing on her left cheek.

The red-clothed girl was stunned, clutching her cheek and staring blankly at Zhang Ruoxi. The burning pain made her feel both terrified and ridiculous. After a while, she muttered, “You really dared…”

Smack…

Now a handprint appeared on her right cheek as well.

The red-clothed girl suddenly burst into tears, sobbing uncontrollably as if her heart had shattered. Her tears streamed down like pearls from a broken necklace, painting a picture of utter despair.

Seeing this, Zhang Ruoxi frowned and scolded, “Shut up! If you cry, I’ll slap you again!”

These words seemed to have a magical effect. The red-clothed girl immediately stopped crying, but her shoulders kept trembling as she sobbed silently.

She was truly terrified of being hit again.

Zhang Ruoxi snorted coldly, “You got slapped twice and cried like that, but when you were whipping others just now, why didn’t you think about whether you were wrong? That old man wasn’t refusing to guide you—he only asked for two more days. Why did you have to treat him like that? Don’t you know how much that whip hurts?”

“You impudent girl!” Elder Fu couldn’t stand Zhang Ruoxi not only slapping his Young Lady but also lecturing her so seriously. He couldn’t hold back and shouted.

Zhang Ruoxi raised her hand and slapped again.

Zhang Ruoxi raised her hand and slapped again. “Sir said that if anyone dares to speak, I’m to hit you. If you want to blame someone, then blame the one who spoke just now.”

The red-clothed girl turned her head, her beautiful eyes blazing with fury as she glared viciously at Elder Fu, as if she wanted to kill him.

“Uh…” Elder Fu shrank his neck under her glare, realizing his Young Lady now held a grudge against him, his mouth full of bitterness.

Yang Kai chuckled and looked at Elder Fu, “Sir, do you have anything left to say? I’m all ears!”

Elder Fu’s face was frighteningly dark as he stared coldly at Yang Kai, but he didn’t dare utter a single word.

What a joke—if speaking meant his Young Lady would get slapped, and she already blamed him, saying another word might cost him his life by tomorrow.

Yet as her bodyguard, he had failed to protect her, watching her get bullied without being able to resist. Who knew what punishment awaited him when they returned?

Elder Fu was caught between a rock and a hard place, his frustration bubbling up like thousand-year-old wine fermenting in his heart, swirling so fiercely that stars danced before his eyes. He almost wished he could simply faint on the spot—at least then he wouldn’t have to witness any more of this humiliation.
