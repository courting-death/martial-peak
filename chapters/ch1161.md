## Chapter 1161 — Blood Battle

Yin Sudie had not intended to bid so early; she truly liked that Dragon-Slaying Whip. She had never owned an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure before, and having such an item would greatly increase her personal safety when venturing into the Flowing Flame Sandland, where one never knew what dangers might lie in wait.

But that shortsighted Qu Changfeng had somehow steered the conversation onto her, which infuriated Yin Sudie—if she didn't want to bid she was now forced to.

Liuli Sect was not as powerful as the Battle Sky Alliance, but they still had the means to purchase an Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure; there was no need to let Qu Changfeng stir up a citywide commotion and needlessly damage the Sect's reputation and their own good name.

Once Yin Sudie bid, everyone could see what she intended: she plainly refused to owe Qu Changfeng a favor. For a while many people cast meaningful glances toward the Battle Sky Alliance's private room, their faces alight with schadenfreude.

Qu Changfeng, however, seemed unconcerned and declared loudly, "Since Junior Sister Yin herself wants to bid, I, Qu, won't overstep. I wish Junior Sister to succeed in obtaining the treasure—please, everyone, go easy on her; it's rare for her to bid, so do not let her down."

He spoke casually, but his half-hard, half-soft words still annoyed many. There was nothing they could do—after all, he represented the Battle Sky Alliance. Only Leitai Sect and Star Emperor Gate could be mentioned in the same breath; those three forces were widely acknowledged as the strongest on Dark Star.

Sure enough, after Qu Changfeng finished speaking, no one in the noisy auction hall raised the price. Even Fang Tianzhong, who had sparred with him all along, fell silent.

In the Yingyue Hall private room, the pretty young woman looked at the Dragon-Slaying Whip with obvious longing. Qian Tong glanced at her and asked, "Xuan'er, do you want this treasure?"

The woman called Xuan'er had her beautiful eyes flicker; she then shook her head and said, "Xuan'er does not want it."

"You really don't want it?" Qian Tong prodded. "If you want it, we'll bid now!"

The girl smiled faintly. "It's true, Master. If it were just an ordinary Origin-Grade Middle-Level whip, I'd still want it, but the venomous spike at its tip is rather sinister—Xuan'er does not want it."

The handsome young man, who had not spoken until now, grinned and said, "Junior Sister Xuan'er is kind-hearted. Even wounded little beasts would be brought back for treatment. That venomous spike at the tip truly doesn't suit her nature. It's one of the things I admire most about Junior Sister Xuan'er!"

Hearing the young man say such things so openly in front of so many, the pretty girl's cheeks flushed.

Qian Tong sighed softly and looked at the pretty girl with some guilt.

He knew full well his disciple's words were an excuse. The spike at the tip was indeed venomous and vile, but couldn't they simply not use it? The disciple's remark was to avoid letting Yingyue Hall offend Liuli Sect and the Battle Sky Alliance.

After all, Yin Sudie had already begun to bid, and Qu Changfeng was clearly backing her.

These two youngsters flirting with one another were nothing to Qian Tong—he believed that even if he participated in bidding the whip, he would not truly offend Liuli Sect or the Battle Sky Alliance. But… what if he spent Saint Crystal now and later lacked enough to bid on that final item? What then?

Precisely because Qian Tong more than anyone understood how precious that final centerpiece would be, Yingyue Hall had not once intervened during this Jubao Tower auction; they had been conserving their strength, preparing for the final struggle.

His disciple's thoughtfulness warmed Qian Tong's heart but also filled it with bitterness—he was an elder of Yingyue Hall, and even when he wanted to buy a treasure for his disciple, he had to weigh things carefully.

Just as his mood darkened, the handsome man suddenly shouted, "Three million five hundred thousand!"

That price reignited discussion in the auction that had settled down.

"See, an Origin-Grade Middle-Level secret treasure can't possibly go for only three million two hundred thousand—finally someone raised the price."

"Who is that, so bold? Aren't they afraid Qu Changfeng will mark them?"

"They're in the A-Class private room; they're not from a small force—what's there to fear?"

"That's the Yingyue Hall private room. I remember Elder Qian's voice coming from there—the bidder is Yingyue Hall's most talented disciple, Wei Guchang; his personal strength isn't inferior to Fang Tianzhong or Qu Changfeng."

"It's him, then he must be buying it for Dong Xuan'er. I heard they grew up together and harbor feelings for each other—who knows if it's true!"

Inside Yingyue Hall's room, Dong Xuan'er stared at Wei Guchang in astonishment; she hadn't expected him to bid outright.

Wei Guchang smiled. "If you want it, we bid—we'll pay and not mind what others think."

Saying that, he looked to Qian Tong and asked, "Elder Qian, may I use these few million Saint Crystals?"

Qian Tong smiled slightly. "You may."

His heart swelled with comfort. Dong Xuan'er was his disciple. Though Wei Guchang had no formal master-disciple relationship with him, Qian Tong had guided him in cultivation for years—no formal title, but like a teacher and student. Both were talented; had they been born off Dark Star, they would surely achieve even greater things.

What pleased him most was that Wei Guchang treated Dong Xuan'er with care, like an elder brother doting on her, tolerating her little quirks; Dong Xuan'er herself was gentle and lacked the faults common among disciples from major sects.

It could be said that these two were the brightest prospects of Yingyue Hall, and Qian Tong regarded them as the sect's greatest hope.

Now that Wei Guchang was bidding for Dong Xuan'er, he naturally gave his full support.

"Four million!" came Yin Sudie's call again from Liuli Sect's private room.

Although her voice was even and soft, she ground her teeth inside. Had Wei Guchang not bid, she might have won the Dragon-Slaying Whip at three million two hundred thousand, but his intervention raised the price considerably.

It would be like wasting money for nothing.

On the high platform, stern-faced Yan Pei sat composed as a mountain, his expression unmoving; only occasionally did the corner of his mouth curve into a faint, cold smile before he quickly suppressed it.

An Origin-Grade Middle-Level Secret Treasure sold for three or four million? Absurd. If I don't push it past ten million today, I won't deserve the title of Jubao Tower's chief auctioneer. Even if Wei Guchang hadn't bid, someone else would have. Yan Pei wasn't worried in the least that the whip would sell cheaply.

"Four million two hundred thousand!" Wei Guchang, in the Yingyue Hall room, raised the bid almost without thinking.

"Four million five hundred thousand!" Yin Sudie's temper flared; her voice remained soft and pleasant, but her tone grew urgent.

Wei Guchang was about to raise the price again when Qian Tong suddenly shook his head: "Don't bid any further."

Wei Guchang looked at Qian Tong in puzzlement. "Why? Even if we spend a few more hundred thousand, the whip isn't overpriced."

"True, but if we win it, we'll lose our chance to compete for that final item. Besides… do you think Old Yan Pei is a pushover? He will make Liuli Sect bleed without requiring our participation."

"There's another auction item?" Wei Guchang stiffened. Dong Xuan'er also asked in surprise, "Didn't Senior Yan say this was the finale?"

"Can't a finale be two items?" Qian Tong chuckled and said to Wei Guchang, "Xuan'er already knows your intention—that's enough. There's no need to keep bidding."

"I understand." Wei Guchang wasn't the sort to make a show for a woman's favor like Qu Changfeng. At Qian Tong's words he immediately grasped the elder's meaning and ceased bidding.

With Wei Guchang dropping out, others assumed he had withdrawn from the contest and could not help but feel disappointed.

Yan Pei cast a glance at Yingyue Hall's private room and sneered, "Old fox, crafty and cunning!"

He seemed unaware that he and Qian Tong were cut from the same cloth—one released tidbits of information to maximize auction profits and force others to quickly gather Saint Crystals; the other had collected tolls at Tianyun City's Space Array and left the great forces bawling but with no recourse.

He squinted toward the auction hall — only murmurs of discussion could be heard, and none of the major private rooms showed any intent to bid. Yan Pei grew secretly irritated and was just about to use the backup plan he’d prepared to drive up the price of the Dragon-Slaying Whip when suddenly, a loud voice rang out: “Pardon the offense — four million six hundred thousand!”

The voice came from one of the B-class private rooms. No one knew whether the “offense” he spoke of referred to Yin Sudie or Qu Changfeng, but in any case, before the bidding had even begun, his momentum was already a step weaker than theirs.

Probably the people in that room wanted the Dragon-Slaying Whip but felt uneasy, so they prefaced their bid with an apology to show humility and avoid trouble later.

Sure enough, the Battle Sky Alliance's private room answered with Qu Changfeng's cold snort—his tone carried unmistakable menace.

Wei Guchang's earlier participation irritated Qu Changfeng though he had held his tongue—Yingyue Hall was no weakling, and Wei's bid had been for Dong Xuan'er, which was understandable. Yet now someone from a B-class room could dare to challenge his authority, and Qu Changfeng's anger flared.

He had plainly said earlier that Junior Sister liked the Dragon-Slaying Whip and politely asked others to go easy, and yet so many thoughtless people were making trouble.

He prepared to say a few words to show his might when Liuli Sect's voice—Yin Sudie's, tinged with anger—rang out: "Five million!"

From the look of it, Yin Sudie was determined to secure the Dragon-Slaying Whip; she had passed on Origin-Grade Lower-Level treasures before and would not miss this opportunity.

Once five million was called, the B-class private room fell silent; whether they lacked more Saint Crystals or feared Qu Changfeng's cold snort was unclear.

The latter was the likelier reason.

The auction hall fell silent again—after five million, no one increased the bid.

Inside Room C-13, Yang Kai frowned slightly, deep in thought. His expression flickered a few times before he suddenly called out a price that shook the entire hall: “Six million!”
