## Chapter 546 — What Are You Doing?

Facing Qiu Yimeng’s blade, Yang Kai still wore a smile, looking utterly reckless. His gaze burned steadily on the woman mere inches from him, yet his body remained motionless, not even condensing True Yuan—he genuinely seemed to have no intention of fighting back.

Qiu Yimeng’s beautiful eyes shone with unwavering determination, her hand movements growing ever swifter.

The next moment, Yang Kai’s expression abruptly changed, shock flickering in his eyes as he stared at her, then suddenly reached out to grab her.

“Pfft…”

A muffled grunt escaped alongside a splatter of blood.

Shouts of surprise erupted as the strong warriors behind the two surged forward crazily, rushing into the fray.

Chen Xuan and the others’ eyes burned with fanatic intensity as they fixed on Yang Kai’s stunned face, grinning fiercely.

Ying Jiu, Tang Yuxian, and Earth Demon simultaneously unleashed their own powers, leaping over Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng’s heads to confront Chen Xuan and his group.

The battle ignited in an instant. Warriors below the Divine Roaming Realm could not intervene, and even the young generation’s leaders dared not approach closely, only able to launch their Martial Skills and Mystery-Grade Secret Treasures from a distance.

Radiant light blossomed, and energy ran rampant.

Amidst the chaos, Luo Xiaoman stumbled over to stand beside Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng, then covered her mouth in shock as she took in the situation.

Qiu Yimeng lay limply in Yang Kai’s arms, her face as pale as death, bloodless but smiling silently at him. In her lower abdomen was a dagger—exactly the Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure she had produced earlier.

Yang Kai, in contrast, was completely unscathed.

“What are you doing?” Yang Kai roared angrily.

“I couldn’t bring myself to strike…” Qiu Yimeng smiled weakly. “This was the only way I could think of to take myself out of the fight temporarily.”

Halfway through her earlier strike, Qiu Yimeng had suddenly redirected the dagger sharply back toward herself. Yang Kai noticed this and acted to stop her.

But her expression had been too earnest, fooling him for a moment into thinking she truly intended to harm him.

By the time he realized and tried to stop her, it was too late.

Blood poured from her lower abdomen, quickly staining her clothes a deep crimson with a strangely beautiful hue.

“Don’t say anything,” Yang Kai frowned but was not overly worried. Qiu Yimeng’s wound was not fatal; the dagger was not inserted too deeply. Thanks to the efficacy of Wan Yao Ling Milk, she would likely recover fully in a day or two, without scars.

“I have a question for you.” Qiu Yimeng gasped for breath but stubbornly stared at Yang Kai.

“Spit it out. Don’t waste my time,” Yang Kai snorted, still annoyed from being baffled by her earlier action.

Qiu Yimeng paid him no mind, her gaze filled with expectation as she softly asked, “If I had really wanted to stab you just now, would you have resisted?”

“What do you think?” Yang Kai glared at her.

“I don’t know. I never know what you’re thinking.”

“I’m no fool; why would I just stand there letting you stab me?”

“I thought so…” Qiu Yimeng laughed, “You really are a selfish person, but if you weren’t, then you just wouldn’t be you.”

Yang Kai smiled wickedly, “If you actually had the intention to stab me, you’d be finished today.”

“What would you do? Kill me?”

“No need for that. I’d just strip you naked and… haha, give you a good spanking!”

Qiu Yimeng instantly blushed, never having been spoken to so shamelessly. For some reason, an image of herself bare and Yang Kai pressing her to the bed, furiously spanking her rear, flashed through her mind.

So embarrassing.

“Enough of this nonsense,” Luo Xiaoman said awkwardly from the side. “Hurry and heal the wound.”

“Not life-threatening,” Yang Kai replied casually, scooping Qiu Yimeng up in his arms. Casting a glance toward the chaotic battlefield, a cold light flickered deep in his eyes as he stepped into the residence.

Luo Xiaoman followed closely behind.

Soon, the three arrived at Su Yan’s chamber.

Pushing the door open, a wave of icy cold greeted them.

Su Yan sat upright on an ice-cold bed, appearing to be deep in cultivation, though her thoughts were elsewhere. Naturally, she was following the battle unfolding at Yang Kai’s residence but, due to her origin in Lingxiao Pavilion, could not intervene openly and had to wait quietly.

“What happened? How did she get injured like this?” Su Yan asked immediately upon seeing Qiu Yimeng.

“That foolish woman stabbed herself,” Yang Kai said as he laid Qiu Yimeng on the frost bed. The cold seeped into her body, causing an involuntary shiver, but it also rapidly slowed the bleeding.

“She’s entrusted to you,” Yang Kai instructed before turning and leaving.

Qiu Yimeng’s wound was too delicate a matter for him to handle directly. If it had been anywhere else, he would have treated it himself. But in the lower abdomen, he felt awkward and hence entrusted her to Su Yan’s care.

Su Yan had Wan Yao Ling Milk on hand and knew exactly what to do.

Sounds of battle continued without cease. Looking out, half the sky seemed lit by the dazzling bursts of energy.

When Yang Kai returned outside, he was shocked to find the battle at a stalemate, both sides evenly matched.

On the Falling Leaf Hall side of the Qiu Family, over twenty Divine Roaming Realm warriors above the Sixth Stage gathered.

On Yang Kai’s side, there were three at the peak of Divine Roaming Realm—Ying Jiu, Tang Yuxian, and Earth Demon—each with extraordinary skills.

Shui Ling also used her unique physique to meddle, confusing the enemy’s senses.

The other Divine Roaming Realm warriors were numerous, giving Yang Kai’s side a clear numerical advantage, but the Falling Leaf Hall’s strong fighters were not to be underestimated. Thus, even with superior numbers, they gained no advantage.

A bitter struggle ensued.

Since the Succession War began, Yang Kai’s residence had never faced such a dire situation. Every previous battle ended with overwhelming victory.

Chen Xuan and his comrades found this unbelievable. Initially brimming with confidence, once the fighting started, they realized the rumors had not exaggerated Yang Kai’s forces’ power; they might even have underestimated it.

The Falling Leaf Hall’s warriors had mobilized nearly all their forces, yet they still struggled against the residence of a single Yang Family scion.

Chen Xuan felt a deep sense of shame, his attacks growing ever more ruthless and merciless.

Yang Kai observed silently, refraining from joining the battle. Instead, his gaze shifted to the distance.

He sensed the convergence of many powerful presences.

Those were no less powerful than the Falling Leaf Hall’s warriors and outnumbered them several times over!

Without a doubt, these were the strong fighters from the other six great families.

Just as Yang Kai expected, one li away, atop a three-story pavilion, Ye Xinrou led the sons and daughters of the six major super families, watching the battle from afar.

Though night had fallen, the moonlight was enchanting, and they clearly saw everything transpiring at Yang Kai’s residence.

Qiu Yimeng’s sudden attack, Yang Kai’s response—they observed every detail clearly.

But the ending surprised them greatly.

The one lying in a pool of blood was Qiu Yimeng.

A trace of schadenfreude flickered across Ye Xinrou’s delicate face as she coldly snorted, “Yang Kai truly has lost all humanity. Even someone like Qiu Yimeng, who has supported him for so long and been so close, he could still coldheartedly deal her a deadly blow.”

Kang Zhan and the others remained silent. Though they disliked Ye Xinrou’s haughty manner, they agreed with her accusation.

From such a distance, they saw none of the subtleties involved, only that Qiu Yimeng had been hurt by Yang Kai.

Since entering Yang Kai’s residence, Qiu Yimeng had served diligently as his right hand, managing the entire estate with great dedication. Yet, in the end, she was harmed by him...

Any of them would be disheartened in such a situation.

And to do such a thing proved Yang Kai’s absolute selfishness.

Only Huo Xingchen showed a grim, sneering expression. Though he hadn’t seen the full picture, he refused to accept Ye Xinrou’s narrative.

“Looks like my plan has failed,” Ye Xinrou remarked. Yet there was no hint of disappointment on her face—only a trace of joy, as if she took pleasure in Qiu Yimeng’s plight. Then she added with feigned solemnity, “If I had known this would happen, I wouldn’t have let Sister Qiu risk herself alone. Haha, we clearly overestimated Yang Kai’s moral compass. This fellow is truly beyond redemption—like all evil fiends, heartless and cruel.”

“What now?” Gao Rangfeng asked solemnly. Qiu Yimeng’s so-called surprise strike had failed to achieve its intended effect, causing him to suspect Ye Xinrou had deliberately planned it this way. A sense of distrust rose in his heart.

“We wait and see,” Ye Xinrou replied calmly, puckering her lips. “Look, they're fighting now.”

“Should we send reinforcements?” Kang Zhan frowned. “If we stand by carelessly, the Qiu Family may talk behind our backs.”

“Let them fight a while longer,” Ye Xinrou smiled softly. “Ying Jiu and Tang Yuxian have already unleashed the Blood Fury Technique. I doubt anyone from your family will want to face them now. After the Blood Fury dies down, we can step in.”

A strange expression crossed their faces, but no one contradicted her.

No one wished to see their own experts suffer losses.

After this, all remained silent, waiting.

The battle intensified, with injuries and deaths mounting.

Yang Kai’s side suffered losses, as did the Falling Leaf Hall.

Though the Falling Leaf Hall’s warriors were skilled, such chaotic combat did not guarantee their safety.

Especially since Yang Kai himself had joined. His burst of wild, vicious evil energy shattered the balance. At the Divine Roaming realm’s Second Stage, Yang Kai could take on a peak Divine Roaming Realm expert single-handedly.

Since cultivating his Sea of Consciousness, his soul skills had fully developed. Coupled with that small sword-shaped Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure, he struck unexpectedly, often killing with a single blow.

The Falling Leaf Hall’s losses mounted rapidly as the situation escalated. Unable to bear it any longer, Chen Xuan shouted loudly, “Miss Ye!”
