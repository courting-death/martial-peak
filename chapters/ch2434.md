## Chapter 2434 — Star Seal Fusion

Yang Kai let out a cold laugh, stepping down from the void, he mocked, “Two pieces of trash. To die under the Divine Ability of the Great Emperor of Time—at least you can die without regrets.”

“The Great... Emperor!” That Senior Brother had clearly heard of the Great Emperor of Time’s reputation. At Yang Kai’s words, his eyes rolled back in terror, his throat rasped, and his breathing quickened—air could enter but not leave. Soon, his head lolled to the side, and he died on the spot.

The Junior Brother, though not dead immediately, was clearly not much better off. He was on the verge of death, his aura so weak it was barely there. Unless he was given an extremely powerful life-restoring treasure—like the Immortal Source Liquid from the Everlasting Tree—he had no hope of survival.

Deep regret flashed in his lifeless eyes. If they had known Yang Kai was this powerful, they would never have provoked this harbinger of disaster.

Very soon, the Junior Brother also lost his breath, his eyes wide open, dying with lingering resentment.

Two soft whooshes sounded as two beams of light suddenly shot out. Yang Kai saw clearly that these were the five-pointed Star Seals from the backs of the dead men’s hands.

He had seen this scene before. Back in Four Seasons Land, he had killed someone who possessed a Star Seal, and after that person died, their Star Seal had flown out in just this way.

After the two five-pointed Star Seals flew out, they didn’t go far. Instead, as if drawn by some force, they circled Yang Kai a few times before suddenly plunging into the back of his hand.

Yang Kai felt a slight heat on the back of his hand. Looking down, he saw that his original five-pointed Star Seal seemed to have changed, becoming more distinct.

He was slightly surprised. He didn’t know why the Star Seals of the dead had fused with his own.

Just as he was filled with doubt, the five-pointed Star Seal on the back of his hand suddenly burst forth with dazzling light and exploded into countless points of starlight.

Yang Kai was dumbfounded!

Earlier, those two had tried to snatch his Star Seal. He had thought that seizing others’ Star Seals would bring him great benefits, but this situation had caught him completely off guard.

His own Star Seal had exploded after fusing with the others’!

What should he do now? Although he had already entered the Shattered Star Sea and the Star Seal’s function as a pass no longer mattered, it was still crucial for sensing the locations of Origin Power. Without a Star Seal, how could he possibly search for Origin Power in this vast and boundless Shattered Star Sea?

If he had known this would happen, he would never have let others’ Star Seals fuse with his own. Yang Kai’s heart ached as if it were bleeding.

But in the next instant, a sudden change occurred.

The exploded starlight actually reformed itself on the back of Yang Kai’s hand. Accompanied by a scorching pain, a brand-new Star Seal appeared before his eyes.

“A six-pointed star?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but exclaim softly.

He could hardly believe his eyes. After his five-pointed Star Seal exploded, the starlight reformed into a six-pointed Star Seal on the back of his hand!

The wild swings of emotion in such a short time left Yang Kai momentarily stunned.

He quietly sensed for a moment and discovered that after the appearance of the six-pointed Star Seal, his connection with the broken Origin of this shattered star had grown stronger—much more obvious than with the five-pointed Star Seal.

“Could it be that the higher the grade of the Star Seal, the easier it is to sense Origin Power?” A bold guess suddenly sprang into Yang Kai’s mind. Though he couldn’t confirm it with anyone, his own experience told him it was absolutely true.

Yang Kai recalled the seven Star Seals he had obtained back in Four Seasons Land. Among them were triangular, diamond-shaped, and five-pointed Star Seals.

Back then in Four Seasons Land, Princess Lan Xun of Star God Palace had told him that the higher the grade of the Star Seal, the greater the benefits one could obtain in the Shattered Star Sea.

The higher-ups of Qingyang Shrine seemed to have mentioned this as well.

It was just that no one had ever explained it to him in detail.

Thinking about it now, the so-called greater benefits probably referred to the ability to sense Origin Power. The higher the grade of the Star Seal, the easier it was to sense Origin Power from farther away, indicating the direction and location for martial artists.

Now that his Star Seal had evolved into a six-pointed Star Seal, it was definitely more useful than the five-pointed one.

Lan Xun had also said that above the six-pointed Star Seal, there were seven-pointed, eight-pointed, and even the highest nine-pointed Star Seals!

But as far as Yang Kai knew, among the martial artists who had obtained Star Seals in Four Seasons Land, the highest grade was only the five-pointed Star Seal. He had wondered how higher-grade Star Seals could appear, but now it seemed they weren’t obtained naturally, but developed step by step like this.

By killing enemies and fusing their Star Seals with his own, once a certain threshold was reached, the Star Seal would explode and reorganize, advancing to the next grade.

His six-pointed Star Seal was the best proof of this.

The two he had just killed both had five-pointed Star Seals, and so did he. When the three five-pointed Star Seals fused, they upgraded into a six-pointed Star Seal.

In other words, if he could obtain two more six-pointed Star Seals, he could upgrade to a seven-pointed one. By this logic, one day he could obtain the highest nine-pointed Star Seal.

Once he possessed a nine-pointed Star Seal, he would be able to sense Origin Power from extremely far away, no longer needing to search aimlessly.

This experience suddenly made Yang Kai understand many secrets about the Shattered Star Sea and the Star Seals.

No wonder those two wanted to snatch his Star Seal—there was this deeper reason. Yang Kai suddenly understood.

However, advancing his Star Seal to a nine-pointed one would not be easy. How many people he’d need to rob was unknown, and Yang Kai was not someone who enjoyed causing trouble or killing, so he wasn't eager to pursue it.

A six-pointed Star Seal was still usable—why insist on pursuing the highest nine-pointed one?

After standing in place and pondering for a long while, Yang Kai finally collected his thoughts and bent down to pick up the two men’s Spatial Rings. Seemingly triggered by his touch, their corpses suddenly crumbled into dust and scattered on the ground.

Yang Kai was secretly shocked. He had only recently comprehended the Divine Ability “Years Like a Shuttle.” Although he knew its power was great, he had never used it before and was unsure of its true might. Today was just a small test.

He hadn’t expected that with a single move, two martial artists of the same level would be utterly unable to resist and would be corroded by the Power of Time like this.

It seemed that the might of this Divine Ability was even greater than he had anticipated. As expected of the Great Emperor of Time’s technique—such power was only natural. Moreover, as Yang Kai’s strength grew and his comprehension of this Divine Ability deepened, its power would only continue to increase. In the future, it would surely become one of his trump cards, just like his Spatial Divine Abilities.

Sweeping his Divine Sense through the two rings, Yang Kai couldn’t help but snort coldly. He found that there were quite a few things inside that clearly didn’t belong to the two men—including some women’s belongings.

These two had clearly committed many acts of murder and robbery.

Perhaps during the year since the Shattered Star Sea opened, they had always worked together to kill others, seizing their belongings and Star Seals.

No wonder both of them had five-pointed Star Seals. Their Star Seals had probably been upgraded as well. Who knows how many people had fallen victim to them?

Yang Kai casually tossed the two rings into the Xuan Realm Pearl, leaving his Incarnation to sort through their contents for him.

Now, he was the only one left here. Although the Origin Power on this shattered star was rather damaged, it was still Origin Power, and Yang Kai naturally wouldn’t let it go.

After thinking for a moment, he waved his hand, and in the next instant Hua Qingsi appeared before him.

As soon as Sister Hua appeared, she glanced around, surprise flashing in her beautiful eyes before she exclaimed excitedly, “Young Master Yang, is this the Shattered Star Sea?”

“Sister Hua, you truly are knowledgeable. This is indeed the Shattered Star Sea!” Yang Kai smiled slightly, all the while closely observing Hua Qingsi’s reaction.

Hua Qingsi’s voice trembled, “It really is the Shattered Star Sea! This is the place Dao Origin Realm martial artists yearn for most. If one can obtain an opportunity here, advancing to the Emperor Realm is within reach...” As she spoke, she glanced at Yang Kai with a strange look. “Why are you staring at me so intently?”

Yang Kai said, “Are you feeling any discomfort? Do you feel like you’re about to be expelled?”

Hua Qingsi was momentarily stunned, but quickly understood what Yang Kai meant. She smiled, “Since you brought me in, whether I have a Star Seal or not, I can stay here. You’re worried I’ll be sent out because I don’t have a Star Seal?”

“Yes!” Yang Kai nodded.

Hua Qingsi waved her hand, “That won’t happen, don’t worry. Many martial artists who lost their Star Seals while training in the Shattered Star Sea can still remain here.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai suddenly slapped his forehead, cursing himself for being so stupid.

If he wanted to gather information about the Shattered Star Sea, couldn’t he just ask Hua Qingsi? She was a disciple of Star God Palace, after all—she surely knew more than most. He had forgotten about her all this time and hadn’t let her out.

But now that he was sure one could stay in the Shattered Star Sea even without a Star Seal, Yang Kai waved his hand and released Liu Yan and Zhang Ruoxi as well.

Zhang Ruoxi rarely left the Xuan Realm Pearl except for major breakthroughs. Seeing Yang Kai summon her this time, she looked at him curiously, not knowing what he wanted.

“This is the Shattered Star Sea, a grand event that all the elite martial artists of the Star Realm participate in—and a great opportunity. Sister Hua, tell us what we need to watch out for here!”

Hua Qingsi nodded, organized her thoughts, and began to explain everything she knew.

Most of what she said, Yang Kai had already guessed, including the upgrading and specific uses of Star Seals. But Hua Qingsi’s explanation was more complete. According to her, higher-grade Star Seals not only allowed one to sense the location of Origin Power from farther away, but could even sense the locations of lower-grade Star Seals.
