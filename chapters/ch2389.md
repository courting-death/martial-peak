## Chapter 2389 — The Lair of the Imperial-Grade Formation Master

Yang Kai was the first to arrive on the deck. Sangde was already standing there, and before long, Man Kuai and the others also came up.

Looking around, the surface of the sea shimmered endlessly, stretching as far as the eye could see. Beneath the blue sky and white clouds, it was a scene of tranquil beauty.

"Master, why have we stopped?" Snake Lady glanced around, asking suspiciously.

"We've arrived." Sangde replied. Though his tone was calm, anyone could sense the faint excitement in his voice.

Hearing this, everyone looked stunned. They scanned their surroundings again, their expressions uncertain. All around was just a vast ocean, no different from anywhere else—how could this be the place?

"That old thing's array skills are extremely high. Calling him an Imperial-Grade Formation Master is no exaggeration. There's a grand Waterlight Ten-Colored Array ahead. It's normal you can't see anything!" Sangde looked forward and explained with a sneer, "If you could see through it, that would be the real problem."

"Imperial-Grade Formation Master!" Shen Fei's expression changed as he frowned. "Master, you never said this was the lair of an Imperial-Grade Formation Master!"

What a joke—were they really about to force their way into an Imperial-Grade Formation Master's lair? Wasn't that just courting death? Even if the master was dead, who knew how many killing and trapping arrays he had left behind? Rushing in recklessly, what good could come of it? They'd probably be blasted to pieces.

Snake Lady and Man Kuai didn't speak, but their faces were full of worry and fear, clearly extremely apprehensive.

"If you're afraid, you can leave now!" Sangde snorted coldly.

Shen Fei's face turned cold, feeling extremely displeased. He felt like he'd boarded a pirate ship. Now Sangde was telling him to leave—was that a joke? Even if he could just walk away, he wouldn't be willing.

"Since Master brought us here, he must have his reasons. What are you all anxious about?" Yang Kai glanced coldly at Shen Fei.

Snake Lady smiled at that and nodded. "That's right, Master must be well prepared. We just need to follow his orders."

Sangde turned to look at everyone. "If that's truly what you think, all the better. From now on, I don't want to hear any doubts. Do as I say. If you don't want to cooperate, get lost now."

No one replied—who would argue at a time like this?

Sangde nodded in satisfaction. "Very good. This Waterlight Ten-Colored Array is formidable, but arrays are dead and people are alive. If that old thing were still alive, I might not be able to break it, but since he's dead... hmph."

He sneered repeatedly. As he spoke, his figure flickered and he flew off the multi-deck ship, beckoning, "Follow me!"

Yang Kai and the others followed in silence.

Next, Sangde seemed to start circling a certain area, making wide loops. As he circled, he kept taking Formation Flags from his spatial ring and tossing them into the void.

Every time they reached a certain spot, Sangde would have one of them stop, hand them a control flag, and instruct them to stand by.

Seeing how smoothly and confidently Sangde moved, everyone’s doubts faded away. Trusting his expertise, they followed his instructions without hesitation or complaint, cooperating fully with his every command.

About half an hour later, everything was ready.

The five of them stood at five different positions, each holding a control flag, ready for action.

Suddenly, a loud shout came from Sangde's side. Immediately, Origin Qi fluctuations surged there. The other four, seeing this, quickly followed Sangde's earlier instructions, channeling Origin Qi into their flags and sending it into the void ahead.

In an instant, over a vast area of the sea, five beams of light shot out like rainbows from the heavens, connecting east, west, south, and north in a tight web.

At the same time, the array flags Sangde had secretly set up earlier all activated at once. Under the control of the five main flags, they resonated together, emitting a strange wave of power.

Visibly, a transparent, hemispherical light screen appeared over the sea, like a giant overturned bowl covering the surface. Through the screen, one could faintly see scenery different from the sea.

Seeing this, everyone immediately knew Sangde was right—this really was an expert's lair, just hidden by a powerful array.

What Sangde needed to do now was break the array and reveal the place.

As the five kept channeling power, the scene within the transparent screen gradually became clearer.

Yang Kai watched closely and saw it was just a small island, not very large, but with beautiful scenery—jagged rocks, lush greenery, a pleasant sight.

Who knew how Sangde's master had found this place? Still, it was a great spot to live. If one couldn't leave the Jixu Secret Realm, living here alone would be quite peaceful.

Unfortunately, that expert had poor judgment, taking Sangde as a disciple. Even after death, he couldn't rest in peace, with Sangde bringing people to disturb his tranquility.

After more than half an hour, Yang Kai and the others were nearly exhausted, their strength almost depleted. The island within the transparent screen finally appeared fully before their eyes.

Just then, Sangde seemed to make a move.

Yang Kai and the others only sensed the array flags around the island hum in unison, then a tremendous force erupted, shattering the transparent screen.

The sudden burst of power sent Yang Kai and the others reeling, nearly catching them off guard.

But from the looks of it, the Waterlight Ten-Colored Array concealing the island had been broken.

Sangde was already leading the way, descending onto the island.

Seeing this, the others quickly followed, not wanting to be left behind.

Soon, the five gathered on the island, standing at its edge.

Sangde didn't move, and no one else dared to act rashly. After all, this was the lair of an Imperial-Grade Formation Master—one wrong step could mean death.

After a moment's thought, Sangde said, "There are still many arrays on this island. I need to break them one by one. Will you wait here, or come with me?" He added, "I suggest you wait here."

Before the others could speak, Snake Lady quickly said, "The island is so dangerous, I feel safer following Master."

"Are you sure?" Sangde glanced at Snake Lady.

Snake Lady pursed her lips and smiled coquettishly. "Master brought me here, so you have to protect me."

She could even flirt with an old man like Sangde—who knew whether it was her nature or just an act.

"What about you?" Sangde turned to the others.

Man Kuai scratched his head and grinned. "I'll follow Master too."

Shen Fei frowned and glanced at Yang Kai.

"I'm tired. I'll rest here. Call me when you're done," Yang Kai said, then actually sat down cross-legged.

Shen Fei said, "Then I'll stay here as well—might as well keep Brother Yang company."

Yang Kai looked at him with a half-smile. Shen Fei's expression didn't change.

"Then you two come with me," Sangde said coldly, beckoning to Snake Lady and Man Kuai, then led the way.

The two looked at each other, unsure if this was the right choice, but at this point, they could only grit their teeth and follow.

Once the three disappeared from view, Shen Fei suddenly looked at Yang Kai. "Brother Yang, aren't you afraid they'll leave you behind if you don't go?"

Yang Kai replied indifferently, "If you're worried, go after them yourself. Why drag me into it?"

Shen Fei smiled. "Brother Yang, you seem quite hostile to me. Did I offend you somehow?"

Yang Kai said, "I'm always like this. If you don't like it, don't talk to me—spare yourself the trouble."

Shen Fei's face twitched, but he forced a smile. "I actually admire people as proud as you, Brother Yang. You seem quite capable. Would you be interested in working with me?"

"Work together? On what and how?" Yang Kai looked at him, a faint smile playing at his lips.

Shen Fei's expression turned serious. "No need to beat around the bush. Since Master invited you here, you must want to leave the Jixu Secret Realm too. If what he said is true, there's a tool here that can let us leave. Don't you want to get it for yourself?"

Yang Kai's lips curled into a meaningful smile. "You've thought this through, haven't you, Brother Shen?"

Shen Fei said, "The exit is under Sangde's control. If he gets the tool, whether he takes us out will be up to him. I don't trust him. But if we get the tool, we'll have the initiative—Sangde will have to listen to us."

Yang Kai nodded seriously. "You have a point, Brother Shen. I hadn't considered that."

Shen Fei smiled. "Maybe you had, but you're just an upright man."

He flattered Yang Kai, which Yang Kai clearly enjoyed. "So, Brother Shen, what's your plan?"

Shen Fei said, "Naturally, we wait for Sangde to find the thing, then..."

"Then you charge in swinging, draw their attention, and I snatch the thing?" Yang Kai interrupted with a half-smile.

Shen Fei's face darkened, his mouth opening and closing, but he couldn't say a word for a long time.

Yang Kai asked seriously, "Brother Shen, do you think that's a bad idea?"

Shen Fei's face twitched. "Well, let me think it over. Those people aren't easy to deal with—one mistake and it's all over."

"Of course, think it through. Let me know when you've decided, so I know when to act!" Yang Kai said seriously.

"Alright, alright!" Shen Fei nodded stiffly.
