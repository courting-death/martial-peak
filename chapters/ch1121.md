## Chapter 1121 — Get Lost

Qiu Yuan had assumed that with Xu Zhishen personally arriving, he would immediately strike to kill Yang Kai and avenge the Young Master. He never expected Xu Zhishen to order him to take the fight instead.

Staring at the youth who smiled faintly in his direction as if there were hidden meaning, Qiu Yuan screamed in terror and, to the astonishment of everyone, turned and ran.

He dared not confront Yang Kai — such a confrontation would mean certain death — so he decisively fled.

Eyes popped everywhere. Among the twenty-odd arrivals there were not only fighters from the Xu Family but also some from the Haike Family. Aside from Wu Yi, who watched Yang Kai with worry as she frantically turned over ways to defuse the crisis, the rest were merely here to watch the show.

Yet now the show had unfolded, just not the way they expected, and that left them unable to accept it.

Even Xu Zhishen was stunned for a moment, but quickly his face grew sterner. He casually threw out a Saint Yuan that condensed into the shape of a rope and, impossibly fast, bound the fleeing Qiu Yuan.

Xu Zhishen snorted coldly. Bright radiance bloomed along the rope as terrifying energy rippled outward; amid Qiu Yuan's terrified screams, the rope bit deep into his flesh.

Crackling sounds of bone breaking rang out; the stench of blood spread instantly. Qiu Yuan, face filled with panic, seemed to find release — the terror in his eyes slowly faded, along with his life, until he collapsed into a heap of shredded flesh.

He had no fighting spirit in his heart, only a single thought to run; his realm had slipped and he had not expected his elders to deal a killing blow, so he never had the chance to resist.

"Cowardly as a rat!" Xu Zhishen bellowed in mortified rage. He could not comprehend Qiu Yuan's behavior, but before a youth only at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm to flee rather than stand and fight was a humiliation to the Xu Family — a matter that would make the Haike Family laugh.

He would naturally show no mercy.

"Very well, then — I shall handle this myself!" Xu Zhishen stepped forward. Coldly fixing his gaze on Yang Kai, he said, "I'll see who gave you the nerve to stand against my Xu Family!"

His words were pointed. The Haike Family elders who had accompanied him all furrowed their brows; though displeased, none spoke up.

If they voiced support it would mean the Haike Family was backing Yang Kai, which could spark enmity between the two houses. For the sake of an unknown brat, the Haike Family would not risk that.

"Senior Xu, please wait!" The elders remained unmoved. Wu Yi hurriedly cried out.

The Haike Family members glanced at her with irritation; Xu Zhishen sneered at her, "Girl, do you have something to say?"

Before Wu Yi could speak, a yellow-robed elder shot her a warning look.

Wu Yi pretended not to see it, cast a worried glance at Yang Kai, then raised her voice: "Senior Xu, Yang Kai is my friend, and I know he isn't one to go looking for trouble. Isn't there some misunderstanding here?"

“He doesn’t like stirring up trouble? Then are you saying it’s my Xu Family that’s causing it?” Xu Zhishen’s expression darkened. “A misunderstanding, is it? Turning Tianze into a crippled fool—was that also a misunderstanding? Girl, go ahead and tell this old man what kind of misunderstanding this is! If you can’t give a proper explanation, even if you’re from the Haike Family, this old man will not let the matter rest!”

"Elder Xu, do not drag my Haike Family into this; this has nothing to do with us!" The yellow-robed elder snorted, his displeasure with Wu Yi and Yang Kai growing.

Wu Yi bit her lip and said, "From what I know, last time Xu Tianze brought people here to do harm to Miss Yang Yan; Yang Kai only struck back to defend her, didn't he?"

She had heard the broad strokes from members of the Xu Family while still in her clan, but the story was riddled with doubts and holes. Leaving aside how a Third Stage of the Saint Realm like Yang Kai could grievously wound Xu Tianze under Qiu Yuan's protection, why had Qiu Yuan not avenged his Young Master? Why return to the Xu Family and summon such formidable reinforcements?

Wu Yi suspected the Xu Family had staged the whole thing; she had yet to discern their motive.

Xu Zhishen's slaying of Qiu Yuan only deepened her confusion.

But in any case she could not stand by and watch Yang Kai be bullied.

"So what if that's so?" Xu Zhishen snorted coldly. "Tianze is my Xu Family's Young Master. If he takes a fancy to a little girl, that's his good fortune; if she doesn't cherish it, fine — but if she dares resist, she clearly has no regard for my Xu Family."

"What kind of logic is that? Just because your Xu Family covets someone must everyone submit?" Wu Yi flared up. Not for anything else, but because Yang Yan was a girl and she herself was a girl — she loathed bully brats who preyed on the weak and trampled on innocent women. So many pure girls were ruined by men like Xu Tianze.

Even if Xu Tianze had been crippled by Yang Kai, Wu Yi would have been glad that justice was done.

Xu Tianze's expression chilled. He frowned and looked at the yellow-robed elder. "Brother Ba, does your Haike Family insist on intervening?"

Ba Qingyan's expression likewise soured. Hearing this, he glared at Wu Yi. "Get lost — this is not a place for your words!"

Wu Yi clenched her teeth and fell silent.

Only then did Ba Qingyan turn to Xu Zhishen and say calmly, "Brother Xu, do as you please. I repeat, this matter has nothing to do with the Haike Family. I hear this youth was simply someone Wu Yi met outside, not one of ours."

"That is good. I do not wish for friction between the Xu Family and the Haike Family. Since Brother Ba says so, I shall not be polite." Xu Zhishen nodded with satisfaction. The two families were evenly matched, but if the Haike Family truly sheltered this young man, Xu Zhishen would be in a bind; at worst he could declare war and bring ruin on both sides. Now that Ba Qingyan had made clear he would not intervene, Xu felt secure.

"Do not act!" Wu Yi suddenly leapt in front of Yang Kai. "He is my friend! I had him stay here. Now that this has happened, whether right or wrong, the Haike Family bears responsibility. Elder Ba, if you truly sit back and let this spread, it will tarnish the Haike Family's name. Then…"

"Outrageous!" Ba Qingyan trembled with anger. He had already declared the matter unrelated to the Haike Family, and never expected a clan direct descendant like Wu Yi to speak up at such a sensitive moment. One misstep could create a rift between the two families, which was something no one wanted.

“You little woman—just because you have some talent, do you think you can act without restraint? Have you forgotten for whom the family laws were established? Considering your youth, this old man will let you off if you crawl back right now. But if you continue to speak so recklessly, you’ll be punished under the family law!” Ba Qingyan roared in fury.

At the mention of the family law, a shiver ran through Wu Yi's delicate form; terror flickered across her pretty face.

Nations have their laws, families have their rules. Every clan and power keeps its own code. Once crossed, such punishments can make life worse than death — even crueller than how one's enemies would be treated.

The Haike Family's clan law was such a thing.

Once enacted, it would ruin the rest of one's life.

The fright lasted only a moment before Wu Yi's expression hardened. She shook her head and, voice hoarse, said, "Yang Kai is my friend. You cannot treat him like this. At worst…I'll compensate your losses myself!"

The last words were directed at Xu Zhishen.

"Losses?" Xu Zhishen sneered. "Our Xu Family's Young Master has been crippled — what will you pay to make that right? Can you afford it? Brother Ba, is this how your Haike Family educates its disciples? A mere girl inserting herself into elder decisions — uncouth and outrageous!"

Ba Qingyan drew a deep breath, his face a storm of anger. "This is our family matter — it is not for you to meddle in! Wait here; I will deal with this shrew later."

Saying so, he fixed a cold look on Wu Yi and offered her two choices: "One, shut your mouth now and go back to the family to accept the clan's punishment. Two, I will act and personally escort you home. The choice is yours."

Wu Yi's face drained of color; she had never imagined things would escalate this far.

She was a woman, yes, but among the Haike Family's young generation her talent ranked near the top. The clan had invested in her heavily; in gratitude she had constantly contributed, never considering herself merely a girl to be married off.

Take the last time they left Dark Star to venture into the Starry Sky for mining — none of the clan's men dared go, so she stepped up and led Yu Feng and the others into the heavens.

It took a full year or two before they returned laden.

They had faced death time and again; nearly half the disciples perished, and she herself had narrowly escaped death several times. Yet the ore they gathered was seized the instant they reached Dark Star.

The clan dared not make a scene; those who returned received little reward. In the end Wu Yi paid out of her own pocket to compensate Yu Feng and the others.

Remembering her contributions, seeing the elders' attitude, and noticing the gloating in her cousins' eyes, Wu Yi suddenly felt disheartened.

She knew she should not have meddled this time, but she could not stand by while Yang Kai was treated unjustly.

Yang Kai was the one she had brought back and arranged to live on Dragon Lair Mountain; the two of them had an agreement…

She suddenly understood that her position in the family was not as important or secure as she had imagined. If those men stirred trouble, the elders might still maneuver on their behalf since they were the clan's future heirs; she was only a woman, destined to leave the family.

The elders' words had been released: whatever choice she made, she would face the clan's punishment.

Wu Yi's future plunged into darkness.

Tears welled in her eyes — not for her own fate, but because years of devotion had felt one-sided. She felt her dedication and toil had been wasted.
