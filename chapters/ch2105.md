## Chapter 2105 — Boundless Darkness

Feng Ming and Gao Xueting, upon hearing this, also fiercely urged their Origin Qi.

“Honored sirs, must you go so far as to take my life?” Yang Kai suddenly spoke up.

The three Emperor Realm experts were all taken aback.

From the start of the battle until now, Yang Kai had spoken only a handful of times, and those words had sounded like the howls of a madman. But now his voice was perfectly calm, clearly showing he had regained his own will.

“Demonic Master, enough nonsense! Today, it’s either you die or we perish!” Chen Wenhao shouted, his longsword pointing forward as the laws of the Three Thousand Sword Dao pressed down on Yang Kai.

Feng Ming and Gao Xueting also attacked at the same time.

Yang Kai’s breath caught. Only after regaining his senses did he fully realize the terror of Emperor Realm experts.

The combined strength of these three was far beyond what he could withstand in his current state.

The only reason he had tangled with them for so long before was because of the influence of demonic thoughts, which had driven his survival and killing instincts.

Now, facing the earth-shaking joint attack of the three Emperor Realm experts, Yang Kai immediately sensed a fatal threat.

He tapped his feet and floated backward. At the same time, he clenched his teeth and shouted in a low voice, “Black-Pupil Purgatory, Boundless Darkness!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the pitch-black demonic pupil in his right eye suddenly shot out a dark mysterious light. The three Emperor Realm experts, meeting that black gaze, all involuntarily paused. Within that pupil, the vicissitudes of time seemed to unfold, stars and moons alternating.

An ancient, desolate aura suddenly spread out.

The sky went dark!

They couldn't even see their own hands.

That patch of darkness enveloped the world, transforming into a prison that covered a hundred li in every direction.

Even the most dazzling sword light and spear shadows, even the nine suns shining together in the sky, could not pierce this shroud of darkness.

The three Emperor Realm experts, working together, felt a jolt in their hearts. Companions who had been right beside them suddenly vanished from sight. Even when they released their Divine Sense, it was thrown into chaos by the endless power of darkness.

That darkness seemed to stretch to the ends of the world, dragging the entire heavens and earth into oblivion.

After the initial panic, the three Emperor Realm experts quickly steadied their minds. Almost simultaneously, they all began forming hand seals.

Tens of thousands of sword lights flew at once. The Yanlei Spear transformed into a lightning Jiao, soaring through the sky. The nine suns erupted in dazzling brilliance, all exploding together.

The boundless darkness revealed a sliver of light.

Instantly, that sliver of light rapidly expanded until it completely dispelled the darkness.

The three hovered in midair, looking around. Only they remained in this place. As for the Demonic Master, he had long since vanished, and no one knew where he had fled.

The three exchanged glances; their faces grew extremely grim. They all unleashed their Divine Sense, covering the land, but could not grasp the direction in which the Demonic Master had escaped.

“What kind of technique is this?” Feng Ming’s face was so dark it seemed he could scrape off a layer of frost. He asked in a deep voice.

Chen Wenhao shook his head. “I don’t know.”

“This must be reported to the Sect immediately, and… we need to head to Star God Palace. The Ancient Giant Demon’s demonic will has emerged; perhaps Star God Palace knows something.” Gao Xueting put away her Scorching Sun Mirror, stroking its surface. On the mirror, strands of dark power clung like maggots to bone, impossible to drive away, making her look pained.

“Junior Sister Gao is right. There’s no time to lose. Let’s set out for Star God Palace at once and hope the Great Emperor can shed some light!” Chen Wenhao said, taking out a jade token and infusing it with Divine Sense before crushing it. A complex ancient pattern appeared before him, flashed, and drifted away on the wind.

Feng Ming and Gao Xueting also each used different secret arts to transmit what they had seen and heard here to the Sect’s main hall.

Immediately, the three set out for Star God Palace, preparing to pay respects to the Radiant Moon Great Emperor and seek answers.

As for whether the escaped Demonic Master would go on to harm nearby Fenglin City, that was no longer their concern. The Demonic Master acted mysteriously and with overwhelming strength; even the three of them together could not kill him, and the barrier technique he used at the end left them all deeply shaken.

If the Demonic Master had chosen to launch a sneak attack at that moment, at least one of them would have died or been wounded!

Tiny Fenglin City was not worth their attention. If not for learning that the Ancient Giant Demon’s seal had been damaged, the three of them would never have come to such a place.

Soon, the wilderness returned to silence.

Meanwhile, in Fenglin City, a cold-faced, beautiful young woman quietly entered the city, her fiery red clothes like clouds at sunset.

Countless martial artists who had survived the disaster could not help but turn their eyes toward this beautiful woman.

Yet some people faintly sensed that this woman possessed a spirit unlike ordinary folk—ethereal and wild, impossible to grasp.

Before long, the woman took out a Sound Bead, infused it with Divine Sense, and seemed to be communicating with someone.

After a moment, she put away the Sound Bead and slipped into a deserted alley.

After waiting for the time it takes to burn an incense stick, a graceful figure suddenly appeared as if by magic.

The woman seemed to sense something, turned to look, and upon seeing the girl, pursed her lips and smiled. “This must be Xiaoqi, right?”

Mo Xiaoqi frowned, glanced behind the woman, but did not see the familiar figure. She could not help but ask in confusion, “Who are you? Did Eldest Brother send you to find me?”

“That’s right!” The woman nodded, flipping her hand to reveal the Sound Bead in her palm.

“That is indeed the item I gave to Eldest Brother.” Mo Xiaoqi nodded, then asked, “Where is Eldest Brother? I heard from City Lord Duan that he was eroded by demonic qi outside the city. Is he alright?”

She looked extremely anxious, clearly worried about Yang Kai’s safety.

“Master is in no immediate danger, just dealing with a minor issue, so he cannot meet you right now. He sent me to pass on a message to you, Miss Xiaoqi.” The woman replied.

“As long as he’s fine.” Mo Xiaoqi relaxed, glanced at the woman, and asked with a smile, “Sister, how should I address you?”

“Master gave me a name: Liu Yan.” The woman answered.

Mo Xiaoqi looked puzzled and spat, “Isn’t Eldest Brother only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm? Sister Liu Yan, you’re also at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Why do you call him master?”

Liu Yan pursed her lips and smiled. “Without Master, I wouldn’t exist today. He gave me a new life!”

Mo Xiaoqi curled her lips. “Forget it, it’s none of my business anyway. What are your plans next, Sister?”

“By Master’s order, I’ll temporarily stay at the Zhang Family’s old residence outside the city. Oh, and Master instructed me to take the Zhang Family with me as well.” Liu Yan said.

“Since Eldest Brother said so, come with me.” Mo Xiaoqi beckoned.

Liu Yan shook her head. “Right now, Shopkeeper Kang is in the middle of his breakthrough, isn’t he? City Lord Duan and the others are all waiting outside your cave residence?”

“Yes.” Mo Xiaoqi nodded.

Liu Yan smiled. “It’s not convenient for me to meet City Lord Duan and the others. Please bring the Zhang Family out of the city—I’ll wait for you there.”

After speaking, Liu Yan turned into a streak of light and shot toward the outskirts of the city.

Meanwhile, Duan Yuanshan, who was waiting outside the cave, seemed to sense something and glanced in Liu Yan’s direction, exclaiming in surprise, “What a strange aura. Another Dao Origin Realm?”

On the other side, Mo Xiaoqi, after seeing Liu Yan disappear, rolled her eyes and muttered suspiciously, “No human warmth at all. This sister is truly odd.”

Although she was curious about what Liu Yan really was, since she was connected to Yang Kai, Mo Xiaoqi decided to pretend ignorance. Still, she understood why Liu Yan said it was inconvenient to meet City Lord Duan and the others.

Duan Yuanshan possessed the cultivation of the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm; perhaps he could see through her true nature at a glance.

Shaking her head, Mo Xiaoqi hurried toward her own cave residence.

Half an hour later, outside the city, Mo Xiaoqi brought the Zhang Family to Liu Yan.

The Zhang Family had probably heard a few things from Mo Xiaoqi, so they did not reject Liu Yan. Instead, upon sensing her profound cultivation, they all respectfully saluted her.

Liu Yan’s powerful First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm cultivation alone was not something the Zhang Family could ignore, let alone her master-servant relationship with Yang Kai.

“You must be young Ruoxi? Truly pure and lovely!” Liu Yan’s gaze swept over the Zhang Family before settling on Zhang Ruoxi, and as she spoke, a trace of doubt flashed in her beautiful eyes.

She did not know why Yang Kai treated Zhang Ruoxi so differently.

The little girl’s body had probably not even matured yet. Though she was quite pretty, if Yang Kai really wanted a woman, would he need to seek out a little girl? With his current cultivation, any woman he wanted would be his for the asking.

Moreover, from what Liu Yan knew of Yang Kai, he was not that kind of lecherous man.

As for cultivation… Zhang Ruoxi’s Second Stage of the Saint King Realm was plain to see. How could such cultivation help Yang Kai?

So Liu Yan was completely baffled.

“Ruoxi greets Lady Liu Yan!” Zhang Ruoxi blushed, her face turning red as she nervously saluted.

Liu Yan responded with a gentle smile.

“Lady Liu Yan, is Sir…” Zhang Ruoxi bit her lip and summoned her courage to ask.

The Zhang Family’s old woman and beautiful matron also looked over nervously, wanting to know Yang Kai’s whereabouts and safety.

“Master is fine, you needn’t worry. He’s just a bit weak after being eroded by demonic qi, and is recuperating. He’ll be back soon.” Liu Yan explained.

“Then this old woman can rest easy.” The Zhang Family’s matron breathed a sigh of relief, and Zhang Ruoxi and the others also relaxed.

“Xiaoqi, I’ll take them back now.” Liu Yan said to Mo Xiaoqi.

Mo Xiaoqi nodded. “Alright, when Eldest Brother returns, I’ll go see him.”

With that, the two sides parted.

Liu Yan led the Zhang Family to their residence outside the city, and in no time, they had returned.

After arriving home, the Zhang Family treated Liu Yan as an honored guest, arranging the best guest room for her.

Liu Yan told everyone she would be entering seclusion to cultivate, then shut her doors and windows tightly, set up a barrier, and isolated herself from the outside world.

Inside the guest room, she opened her lips and spat out a bead the size of a longan, holding it carefully in her palm. Staring at the bead, her beautiful eyes were full of worry, with none of her previous ease.

The bead was none other than the Xuan Realm Pearl!

When Liu Yan appeared and awakened Yang Kai’s mind, he forced himself to use the Ancient Giant Demon’s Secret Art, imprisoning the three Emperor Realm experts with the power of darkness. Then, using a Spatial Art, he linked with Liu Yan, handed the Xuan Realm Pearl to her for safekeeping, and hid inside it to escape.
