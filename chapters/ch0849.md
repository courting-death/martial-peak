## Chapter 849 — Saint-Grade Pillmasters' Contest

Those long-lost spirit formation diagrams hidden in those scrolls contained enormous value; although no one yet knew exactly what the formations did, a thorough study back home would allow them to completely decipher their secrets.

Once the secret on the beast hide was unraveled, everyone was wildly elated.

Du Wan's eyes darted about as he chuckled, “Friends, unlocking the mysteries of these spirit formation diagrams this time was all thanks to Yang Kai’s efforts. Had it not been for him, you’d likely have grown old without fulfilling your wish. Now that you’re satisfied, shouldn’t you show some appreciation?”

“Show some appreciation?” He Feng’s eyes bulged.

Chang Bao hurriedly clapped a hand over his Spatial Pouch and watched Du Wan with extreme wariness.

Last time these men had bet with Du Wan in Fuyun City and lost; as a result, Yang Kai had taken items from their Spatial Pouches. Hearing Du Wan speak like this now immediately put them on alert.

Du Wan paid them no mind and instead looked at Yang Kai with a grin. “My old friends here are always generous. You worked hard to unravel their confusion — I think they should give you some token of thanks… but not too much, just a token of appreciation.”

Hearing that, the four men’s faces soured; they secretly cursed Du Wan as an ungrateful wretch, insatiably greedy.

Kong Ruoyu smiled wryly. “Very well. As Senior Brother said, we did profit greatly, so treating this youngster kindly wouldn’t hurt. Stop putting on those solemn faces — you’ve all taken such a big advantage, you really owe him thanks.”

With Kong Ruoyu speaking, the other three felt they couldn’t protest further.

He Feng stammered as he looked at Yang Kai. “What do you want? Say it and I’ll satisfy you!”

Yang Kai glanced at his Spatial Pouch; He Feng involuntarily gave a sharp shiver.

Chang Bao and Hong Fang also felt their hearts in their throats, fearing Yang Kai might repeat what he’d done before and take things from their Spatial Pouches.

Yang Kai gave a soft laugh and said aloud, “I can’t refuse such generosity — I won’t be rude. Hmm… this time I won’t take the treasures from your Spatial Pouches.”

The three male pillmasters visibly relaxed and looked at Yang Kai kindly, as if thinking he was being sensible.

“Then what do you want?” Du Wan asked in surprise. “My friends here are as rich as nations; this chance won’t come again.”

“Du Wan, shut up and let the youngster state his request.” Chang Bao shot Du Wan an angry glare.

“Alright, I won’t say anything!” Du Wan yielded and fell silent at once.

Yang Kai pondered a moment, then said, “How about this: since you masters are all Lower-Level Saint-Grade pillmasters, as payment for deciphering those spirit formation diagrams, each of you refines a Saint Pill and gives it to me. How about that?”

Chang Bao’s face twitched at the suggestion of refining a Saint Pill.

“Yes, refine a Saint Pill!” Yang Kai nodded solemnly.

“Saint Pills aren’t easy to make,” He Feng said, rubbing his chin. Although they were all Saint-Grade pillmasters, refining Saint Pills carried huge risks and could easily fail.

The process was also laborious and painstaking.

Precisely because of that, every Saint Pill in the world carried a hefty price.

“Fine.” Du Wan suddenly brightened and looked at the other four with burning eyes. “Haven’t we been without a proper competition for a long time? Why not take this chance to compare? Let Yang Kai and Ye Xiong act as judges so we can see whose Saint Pill is superior.”

“Du Wan, do you think that just because you’re almost promoted to Middle-Level Saint-Grade you can look down on us?” He Feng chuckled.

“Not at all... it’s just a rare opportunity and I’m itching for it.”

“Alright, I agree with Senior Brother Du’s proposal — it has indeed been a long time since we last competed.” Kong Ruoyu’s interest was piqued.

“I don’t care either way.” Hong Fang shrugged.

“Then it’s settled. Oh, pity my old bones…” Chang Bao shifted his bulky frame and complained theatrically.

“Gentlemen, please follow me.” Du Wan laughed heartily, clearly pleased, and strode forward. The others followed.

Yang Kai’s request that they refine Saint Pills wasn’t driven by the pills themselves.

He could now refine Saint-Grade pills; although it wasn’t easy and the materials were rare, Yang Kai’s Black Book Space was richly stocked, and the value of a few Saint Pills meant little to him.

What he wanted was to observe the masters’ insights and techniques during their refinement process and learn from them.

The masters understood this and didn’t refuse — not only did they readily agree, they secretly resolved to display their most exquisite techniques when the time came.

Inside the Alchemists' Association’s alchemy hall, each lord found a good spot, took out their furnaces and corresponding materials, and set them on the tables.

Each of those ingredients pulsed with Spiritual Qi, crystalline and dripping with essence — clearly materials of Saint-Grade rank.

Yang Kai, Ye Xiong and Mi Na watched from the side.

Du Wan of course invited Ye Xiong and Mi Na over to witness the spectacle.

As for the little girl Wu’er, she was far too young and inexperienced to gain much by watching, so she wasn’t informed.

Mi Na flushed with excitement, sitting cross-legged beside Yang Kai. She asked anxiously, “Why have the masters suddenly decided to compete at pill refinement? And it’s for Saint Pills?”

“Yes. I haven’t seen Elder Du refine a pill in ages, and there are four others this time — this is truly a rare, grand occasion!” Ye Xiong was equally excited, eyes blazing as he warned, “Mi Na, you’d better keep your eyes wide open and miss nothing — it’ll be of great help to your growth.”

“I understand, Master.” Mi Na nodded hard, her expression intensely focused.

“Are you all ready?” Du Wan asked with a smile as he glanced around.

Everyone gave a slight nod, indicating they were prepared.

“Then let’s each announce what pill we’ll refine.” Du Wan smiled and said, “I’ll refine the Profound Ice Transformation Pill — specially crafted for those who cultivate Frost Ice techniques and martial skills. After taking it, one can create an extremely cold environment within the body, aiding in the condensation of True Yuan and the improvement of one’s cultivation. The required materials are the Profound Ice Jade Crystal Flower, Colorless Soil, Jadeblood Grass, and the Inner Core from a Seventh-Tier demonic beast called the Ice-Jade Python...”

Du Wan’s voice carried outward, and the three onlookers exchanged thoughtful looks.

A pillmaster has many personal preferences when refining; their choice of materials reveals much. How those ingredients are combined and tempered follows each master’s unique approach.

Du Wan clearly intended Yang Kai and the others to learn as much as possible, which was why he explained everything in such detail.

When he finished, Kong Ruoyu smiled faintly and announced, “I will refine the Soul-Safeguard Pill, which protects the spirit. If one’s spirit is harmed and they take this pill, it can prevent dispersal and also has some healing properties. The materials required are Shura Bone, Soulless Ghostface Flower, Spirit-Firming Stone Stalagmite, and Hundred-Tribulation Condensed Jade Dew...”

One after another the masters proclaimed the names of the Saint Pills they would make and the heaven-and-earth treasures required.

Mi Na and Ye Xiong listened with mouths agape — each of those ingredients was exceedingly difficult to find. To see so many heaven-and-earth treasures gathered together was truly a rare spectacle.

Their hearts quickened and blood coursed through them faster.

After a moment, the five masters exchanged glances and Du Wan said, “Very well, then let us begin!”

The other four all nodded.

In the next instant, pure True Yuan burst forth from the five bodies, instantly raising the temperature throughout the entire alchemy hall.

Yang Kai and the others watched intently as the masters’ True Yuan surged and, within their furnaces before them, arranged the spirit formations needed for pill refinement.

It seemed they deliberately wanted Yang Kai and the others to see clearly as they constructed the formations; each stream of True Yuan left discernible traces. When the diagrams were completed, Yang Kai, Ye Xiong and Mi Na all clearly glimpsed the structure of those spirit formations.

One by one, the heaven-and-earth treasures were placed into the furnaces. The five masters moved with effortless grace; the materials within the cauldrons were tempered into medicinal liquid, guided by True Yuan, and set aside.

Mi Na watched in awe and clapped a small hand over her mouth, fearful of making a sound that would disturb the masters.

Yang Kai’s eyes were dazzled as well. Although his own level of pill refinement could rival these masters, there was still much to learn — especially those nuanced techniques and the fine points noticeable in how they handled the medicinal liquids.

Grasping these details would greatly improve his own pillcraft.

Each master’s hands flitted like graceful butterflies; for them, pill refinement was an art. In those nimble hands, the essence of alchemy was elevated.

The more Yang Kai watched, the more enthralled he became. His mind sank deeper into the process as he compared how he would refine the pill against these masters, seeking his own flaws and silently memorizing them.

Gradually, Yang Kai lost awareness of everything around him, as if immersed in the world of alchemy itself.

Mi Na and Ye Xiong were the same — they, too, had forgotten the passage of time.

Sweat beaded and True Yuan surged through the alchemy room in waves. The spirit formations within the furnaces were repeatedly re-sketched. A top pillmaster wouldn’t use a single formation throughout; depending on timing and the heat, formations would be swapped to achieve the best result.

This point enlightened Yang Kai greatly. Previously he had used one formation from start to finish, but now it was clear that alternating formations at different moments could yield superior results.

The hall filled with the drifting aroma of pills. Mist rose from each master’s furnace, creating an otherworldly, dreamlike scene.

The masters’ expressions grew solemn; at the crucial final moments they dared not be careless — a single misstep could render all previous efforts for naught.
