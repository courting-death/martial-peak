## Chapter 2399 — Heaven’s Will

Yang Kai had only been here for a few months, yet he had already obtained the Bihai Shuttle and given her so many Source Crystals, allowing her to restore her strength without any worries. Thinking about it, Bing Yun realized that Yang Kai seemed to have come here specifically to rescue her.

In the unseen workings of fate, all was Heaven’s will.

Clutching the Spatial Ring, she felt a little emotional for a moment, then suddenly said, “You’ve given me so many Source Crystals, but what about yourself? How about this, I’ll just take half…”

Before she could finish, Yang Kai waved his hand and smiled, “Senior, don’t worry. I have plenty of Source Crystals.”

For any other Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, it would be impossible to take out ten million Upper-Level Source Crystals at once. That’s equivalent to a hundred billion Lower-Level Source Crystals—what Dao Origin Realm cultivator could be so wealthy? But Yang Kai was different. He never lacked Source Crystals. Last time, after killing Yao Changjun, he gained a huge fortune, and later, after killing Sangde, he also collected quite a bit of loot.

Ten million Upper-Level Source Crystals really wouldn’t hurt him.

Hearing this, Bing Yun didn’t refuse any further. She nodded, “Give me five days. After five days, we’ll set out. Also… we need to carefully discuss how to leave this place.”

She couldn’t just swagger out of Tongtian Island, nor could she leave together with Yang Kai. If Chi Ri found out, he would definitely try to intercept them.

“Alright, then I’ll use this time to prepare.” Yang Kai nodded, then asked, “Senior, how many sets of materials have you prepared for the Emperor Yuan Pill? I can refine them for you in advance, just in case.”

Bing Yun was stunned. “You can refine Emperor Yuan Pills? That’s an Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pill.”

Yang Kai gave a sheepish smile. “Please don’t blame me, Senior. Actually, I’m not a Middle-Level Dao Origin-Grade Alchemist. I barely count as an Imperial-Grade Alchemist.”

Previously, he didn’t know what kind of person the Ice Heart Pavilion Master was, or why she wanted to hire an alchemist, so he never showed his true skills. Now that he was being honest with Bing Yun, he felt there was no need to hide anymore.

“Imperial-Grade Alchemist!” Bing Yun’s beautiful eyes lit up in shock. “You’re actually an Imperial Pill Alchemist?”

For someone as young as Yang Kai to have such cultivation was already astonishing. Bing Yun never expected that he was also an Imperial Pill Alchemist!

Even looking across the entire Star Realm, how many Imperial Pill Alchemists were there? Their status was even more noble and rare than Emperor Realm experts. With just this identity, Yang Kai could make the top sects fight over him.

Looking at Yang Kai, a trace of regret flashed in Bing Yun’s beautiful eyes.

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai noticed her expression and wondered what she was regretting.

Bing Yun smiled with pursed lips. “If you were a woman, I would definitely take you as my disciple and pass on my legacy. It’s a pity… my Ice Heart Valley never accepts male disciples.”

Yang Kai scratched his head. “Senior, your kindness is appreciated.”

For Bing Yun to speak so openly with him showed she didn’t see him as an outsider. After all, they shared a deep connection from the same Star Domain, a bond that couldn’t be severed.

“The materials for the Emperor Yuan Pill aren’t easy to find. I’ve only managed to collect ten sets over the years. I’ll give them all to you.” As she spoke, Bing Yun handed some rare herbs to Yang Kai.

These had been her greatest hope for escaping this place, but with Yang Kai’s support of so many Source Crystals, she no longer needed to worry. Whether the pills succeeded or not wouldn’t affect their plans much.

Yang Kai insisted on refining them just as a precaution.

After leaving Bing Yun, Yang Kai immediately began refining the Emperor Yuan Pills.

He hadn’t refined many Imperial-Grade Spiritual Pills before, but practice makes perfect. After wasting two furnaces of materials, Yang Kai quickly got the hang of it.

Over three days, out of ten sets of materials, he produced eight furnaces of Emperor Yuan Pills. The first few batches weren’t very good—barely successful, and all were the lowest Lower-Level Emperor Yuan Pills. But the later batches turned out quite well, with even a few Upper-Level ones.

The quantity wasn’t large, but it was definitely enough.

With two days left before the agreed time, Yang Kai didn’t idle. He told Liu Qianyun not to wander around, then left Ice Heart Pavilion alone and headed for the cave mansion area.

In front of a certain mid-grade cave mansion, Yang Kai waited only a short while before the barrier opened. Ling Yinqin appeared, beckoning him in. “Come in and talk.”

Yang Kai nodded and followed her inside.

This cave mansion was almost identical to the one he had rented before, both in the number and size of rooms.

Once inside, Ling Yinqin served fragrant tea and asked, “What happened the other day? There seemed to be a fight at your cave mansion. When I went to check, the place was a mess, and you and Liu Qianyun were nowhere to be found.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai realized Ling Yinqin had actually gone to look for him. His heart warmed, and he felt coming here was the right choice.

“Someone tried to cause me trouble, so I ran.” Yang Kai grinned, not explaining further.

Ling Yinqin frowned. “I heard an Emperor Realm expert made a move over there. Was the one after you an Emperor Realm expert?” Her face changed, and she exclaimed, “It wasn’t the Pavilion Master of Xuanyun Pavilion, was it?”

She thought the incident at sea, where they killed people from Xuanyun Pavilion, had been exposed, and her face turned pale.

“Not him, someone else.” Yang Kai shook his head. “But it’s all over now. Sister Ling, don’t worry about it. I actually came to ask you something.”

Ling Yinqin said, “Is there something I can help with?”

She didn’t ask what he needed, only if there was anything she could help with—truly a warm-hearted soul.

Yang Kai’s expression turned serious. “Sister Ling, have you ever thought about leaving the Jixu Secret Realm?”

“Leaving!” Ling Yinqin was startled, a trace of longing flashing in her beautiful eyes, but she quickly smiled bitterly and shook her head. “There are millions in Tongtian City—who doesn’t want to leave? But even the Island Lord is trapped here. How could it be easy to escape?”

“So you do want to?” Yang Kai chuckled.

Ling Yinqin replied, “It’s just a dream.” Then she suddenly realized something and looked at Yang Kai in shock. “You’re asking me this… what are you planning?”

Yang Kai said seriously, “If I told you I could leave here, would you believe me?”

“You?” Ling Yinqin was stunned, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief. Unlike others, she was the first person Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun met when they arrived in the Jixu Secret Realm, so she knew his background and that he hadn’t been here long.

For someone who had only just arrived to suddenly claim he could leave, even if Ling Yinqin wanted to believe him, she couldn’t.

If escaping was really that easy, people wouldn’t have been trapped on the island for so long.

After a moment, Ling Yinqin frowned. “Did someone trick you? There are a lot of swindlers on this island, always luring people out to sea to do bad things. Be careful.”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh. “No one tricked me. I’m eighty percent sure I can get out!”

“Eighty percent!” Ling Yinqin trembled, her beautiful eyes going wide.

She didn’t know Yang Kai well, since they hadn’t interacted much. So even though he spoke with such conviction, she couldn’t bring herself to believe him.

Yang Kai said, “My Junior Sister and I haven’t been here long, but you and Brother Jiao have helped us a lot. So if I can leave, I want to take you with us.”

Whether or not the Purification Array Ling Yinqin lent him worked, her willingness to lend it in such a situation showed her kindness. Even when it was damaged, she never blamed Yang Kai. She was a good woman, so if he really left, he wanted to bring them along.

“It’s normal for you to have doubts, Sister Ling. I don’t expect you to believe me right away. But if you really trust me, I won’t let you down! Whether you agree or not, my Junior Sister and I will leave in two days.” With that, Yang Kai stood up.

He had come just to invite Ling Yinqin. Whether she agreed to go was up to her. He couldn’t force her, even if he wanted to repay her kindness.

Ling Yinqin didn’t even notice when Yang Kai left. After hearing his words, she was caught in a dilemma. Her instincts told her Yang Kai wasn’t lying and really knew how to escape. But she didn’t know him well and had no idea where he got this method or if it was safe.

Betting everyone’s lives on just a few words from Yang Kai, the pressure on Ling Yinqin was immense.

In the end, she decided it was best to hear everyone’s opinion, so she immediately took out her Transmission Compass and summoned her crew.

Two days passed in a flash.

On this morning, Yang Kai brought several women to the dock.

Among them were Liu Qianyun, Fan Xin, and a few other disciples of Ice Heart Pavilion. Bing Yun hadn’t taken many disciples on Tongtian Island. Fan Xin and the others were all pitiful girls who had suffered bullying on the island and were taken in by Bing Yun at Ice Heart Pavilion. Their cultivations varied, but Yang Kai was the strongest among them.

“Pillmaster Yang, Master instructed that you are in charge of this trip. What should we do now?” Fan Xin asked nervously.

Last night, she suddenly received a message from Bing Yun, telling her to gather her Junior Sisters and pack up everything from Ice Heart Pavilion, then set out to sea today. As for the journey, Yang Kai would be in charge.
