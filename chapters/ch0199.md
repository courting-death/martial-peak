## Chapter 199 — The Thousand Gold Wine House

However, Gu Feng harbored a doubt in his heart: who was it that secretly orchestrated all of this? He was well aware that this person must have had a grudge against Yunxia and sought to use others as a knife to kill, which was why they deliberately leaked the whereabouts of the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique.

Otherwise, how could things align so perfectly?

Yet, despite Gu Feng's clarity on this matter, he had no choice but to comply with the other's wishes and become the butcher's knife in their hands. The Transforming Moonbreaker Technique was simply too important for Gu Yun Island.

Who was this person? With such cunning and schemes, they were truly not to be underestimated.

At this moment, in a tavern in Haicheng, Yang Kai sat by the window, holding a wine cup, gazing indifferently towards the direction of Yunxia Island.

He drank and ate.

Yang Kai remained seated from morning until evening, not moving an inch.

The battle at Yunxia Island raged from morning until night, with disciples nearly slaughtered to the last, leaving only a few fish that slipped through the net.

With remarkable achievements, Gu Yun Island sent two hundred people, suffering only thirty casualties, yet they annihilated a third-rate sect. This price was still worth it.

As night fell once more, Yang Kai tossed a silver ingot down and slowly left the tavern.

Everything he had done was merely to drop the Transforming Moonbreaker Technique at Yunxia Sect, take a page from it, and send it back to Gu Yun Island.

That was all!

With a flip of his hand, Yunxia was extinguished!

In Haicheng, the Thousand Gold Wine House.

This was a place for revelry, a den of vice, where the young women were heavily made up, adorned with flowers, dressed provocatively, and exuded an irresistible charm, leaning against the railing on the second floor, playfully beckoning.

Outside the main entrance, many alluring young women openly solicited customers, and now and then, a seemingly respectable gentleman was pulled inside.

The entire street was suffused with the rich scent of rouge and the fragrance of young women.

Yang Kai approached the Thousand Gold Wine House alone. Just as he was about to step inside, a girl of about seventeen or eighteen came walking towards him. She was fair and delicate, wearing only light makeup that did not conceal her natural beauty.

With bright eyes and a charming smile, the girl curtsied gracefully, “Good evening, young master!”

Her voice was crisp and pleasant, instantly catching Yang Kai's attention.

Speaking of which, it had been quite some time since he had last felt the stirrings of desire, ever since Yu Aoqing had ignited that fire within him on Hidden Island. With his cultivation and strength improving, the effects of the Dual Cultivation Technique were gradually intensifying. Now, upon seeing this girl, Yang Kai couldn't help but feel a bit flustered.

Here, as long as one paid, they could do as they pleased, with no moral constraints. Everyone played their roles, taking what they needed; it was merely a transaction. After one night, no one would remember anyone else, making it a good place to vent one's desires.

Yet, thinking of how many had tasted this seemingly pure girl, Yang Kai felt somewhat disenchanted.

The girl, perceptive to his mood, smiled sweetly, “Is this your first time in such a place, young master?”

Yang Kai's face flushed slightly, and he stubbornly replied, “No.”

Though young, the girl had been in this line of work long enough to possess some insight. She naturally wouldn’t expose Yang Kai’s pretense. Instead, she stepped closer, wrapping her delicate arm around his, “If the young master wishes to seek pleasure, I can serve you well. How does that sound?”

Yang Kai nodded indifferently, his expression cold.

The girl giggled, leading Yang Kai inside. As they walked, her ample bosom brushed against his elbow intentionally and unintentionally.

Stimulated by her touch, Yang Kai's breathing grew slightly heavier. The girl became even more convinced of her guess; this young master must indeed be a novice in such places.

Upon entering the inner hall, a wave of heat rushed towards them. Since it was a spring house, the scene inside was naturally somewhat indecent, with carvings and murals on the surrounding walls, and the screens and furniture in the hall depicting suggestive images.

Yang Kai scanned the area, astonished.

So, there were so many bizarre and unimaginable sights!

Hmm, when he returned to Lingxiao Pavilion, he would have to ask Su Yan to try this out.

The hall was filled with laughter and chatter; some openly teased the girls in their arms, others passionately kissed, and still others reached into the girls' clothes, groping freely. The sounds of gasps, moans, and playful scuffles filled the air.

Yang Kai felt overwhelmed, his face slightly reddening.

The girl cast a flirtatious glance, tiptoeing to whisper in Yang Kai's ear, “Young master, do you wish to drink and have fun here, or would you prefer to book a room to spend the night with me? Everything is up to you.”

“This place is too noisy.”

“Then come with me!” The girl laughed lightly, taking Yang Kai's hand and leading him towards a nearby staircase.

They ascended to the third floor and found an empty room, where the girl pulled Yang Kai inside.

“Please sit for a moment, young master. I will arrange some food for you,” she said sweetly.

“Wait a moment.” Yang Kai called out to her.

The girl chuckled, covering her mouth, “Are you a bit impatient, young master?”

Yang Kai shook his head, his face flushed, “Actually... I prefer women a bit older.”

The girl was taken aback but was not angry. Everyone had their own tastes; she had seen many men, and some had their peculiar preferences.

“Shall I call an older sister for you?” the girl gently asked.

“No need to trouble yourself; just bring your matron in,” Yang Kai coughed lightly.

The girl was momentarily stunned...

No guest had ever made such a request in this place. The matron of the spring house, although she had been a girl serving customers in her youth, had become less sought after as her beauty faded with age. It was precisely because there were few customers that she had become the matron.

The girl hesitated, “Are you sure you want to call the matron in?”

“Go and call!” Yang Kai casually tossed out a silver ingot.

The girl nodded, “Please wait a moment. I will see if the matron is willing to come.” 

This young master... though he looked young, why did he prefer older women? The matron of the Thousand Gold Wine House was over forty years old; at that age, she could easily be this young master’s mother. His taste was rather heavy, wasn’t it?

But what kind of woman a guest wanted was their own freedom; the girl naturally wouldn’t criticize the Thousand Gold Wine House for opening its doors for business, as long as there was money to be made.

After waiting quietly in the room for a moment, the door was suddenly opened. Yang Kai looked coldly and saw a somewhat plump woman, heavily made up, walking in.

She must have had some beauty in her youth, but at this age, with her body having filled out, her youthful charm had completely faded, leaving only excess flesh.

Upon hearing the girl say that a young master wanted her to accompany him for drinks, the matron was overjoyed and hurriedly came up.

Upon entering and seeing that it was indeed a handsome young master, the matron grew even fonder, thinking that she still had some charm left.

She approached with a smile, “This young master…”

Before she could finish her sentence, Yang Kai reached out, grabbed her, and forcefully pushed her down into a chair.

Swish...

A sharp dagger was thrust before the matron.

Her face suddenly turned pale, her eyes widened as she stared at the dagger, trembling all over.

“What do you... want, young master?” The matron was a clever person; at this point, she understood that Yang Kai was not here for pleasure but likely to cause trouble.

“I have some questions for you.” Yang Kai pulled over a chair and sat down in front of her, his voice low.

“Please ask, young master. If I know, I certainly wouldn’t dare to hide anything,” the matron said in fear.

“About three or four months ago, did you buy a beautiful woman around thirty years old?” Yang Kai squinted at the matron.

The matron forced a smile, “Young master, your question is unclear. How could I remember? Women are often sold into the house.”

“She was sold in by the Miao family.”

The matron's expression changed slightly.

Yang Kai took note of her reaction and continued, “She even scraped her own face, vowing never to entertain customers, and then was sold to Yunxia Sect! So, can you remember her now?”

The matron shook her head, “I don’t recall anyone like that…”

Yang Kai slapped her across the face, producing a crisp sound, leaving a handprint on her cheek.

“Really don’t remember…”

Another slap followed.

“Young master…”

“Smack!”

“I’m not lying to you!”

“Smack!”

“I remember now,” the matron hurriedly spoke, her head spinning from the forceful slaps. She had been hit so hard that stars danced before her eyes, and several of her teeth were knocked out. If she continued to be stubborn, she might be beaten to death. This young man clearly looked like a martial artist who walked the edge of a knife; how could an ordinary person like her resist?

“There was indeed such a woman, but her body was not defiled, and she scraped her own face. It has nothing to do with us.”

“I know.” Yang Kai nodded slightly, then asked, “Then... who beat her? Who forced her to entertain customers?”

“It was... it was...” The matron’s expression was fearful; she never expected that the beautiful woman was actually someone with a background.

“Who was it!” Yang Kai pulled the dagger back, casually cleaning his nails.

“It was me... please spare me, young master! I only lightly whipped her a few times, but any girl sold into the house who refuses to entertain customers is trained this way. I didn’t know she was yours; if I had known, I wouldn’t have dared to treat her that way,” the matron said, kneeling down and knocking her head on the ground like a pestle.

Yang Kai took a deep breath, placing the dagger against the matron's neck, his expression cold.

“Please, don’t kill me!” The matron screamed, “I’ve already told you everything I know! Please spare my life!”

As soon as her words fell, Yang Kai twisted the dagger, blood splattering, and the matron’s eyes gradually dimmed as her body slumped to the ground.

Wiping the blood off the dagger, Yang Kai stood up and left the room, striding towards the exit.

The girl who had led Yang Kai in saw him come running out again and couldn’t help but smile, “Did you enjoy yourself, young master?”

Yang Kai ignored her, causing the girl to be momentarily stunned. She hurriedly rushed back to the room on the third floor, pushed the door open, and saw blood everywhere, with the matron lying on the ground, lifeless.

A scream erupted, and the entire Thousand Gold Wine House was thrown into chaos.

In Haicheng, the Miao family, the lights were bright.

The Miao family had not settled in Haicheng for too long, but Miao Huacheng was indeed a person of some means and ability. He had connections everywhere and married a girl from a wealthy merchant family, raising children and establishing roots in this place. Over the years, they had seen considerable development. Though the family was not large, they could still earn two to three hundred thousand taels of silver each year, allowing Miao Huacheng to live a worry-free life and enjoy a comfortable existence.
