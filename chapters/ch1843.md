## Chapter 1843 — Bring Him Out

"Lord Bai..." Xia Jingwu's forehead beaded with cold sweat as he forced a smile, stepped forward and cupped his hands, "Lord Bai, I, Xia Jingwu, met you three years ago — might you perhaps remember me?"

Bai Zhengchu looked at him coldly. "Who do you think you are?"

Xia Jingwu gave an awkward laugh. "My lord, nobles often forget; of course you wouldn't remember me. However, I am well acquainted with Lord Kang Sheng who serves under you. There is a reason for what happened today — might I trouble you to enter the inner hall for a moment so I can report it to you in detail?"

As he spoke, Xia Jingwu slipped off his Spatial Ring and, without attracting attention, handed it over to Bai Zhengchu.

The Spatial Ring held all his belongings; nearly all his wealth was in that one ring. He still surrendered it without hesitation, because he knew that if the Commerce Guild could not survive this crisis, no amount of treasure would be of any use.

Bai Zhengchu stared at Xia Jingwu in surprise. "You know Kang Sheng?"

Xia Jingwu kowtowed and nodded repeatedly. "It is my good fortune."

Bai Zhengchu sneered. "Looks like Guard Captain Kang Sheng won't be keeping his post; what sort of riffraff has he been associating with?"

Xia Jingwu's face changed drastically.

With that one sentence he had dragged Guard Captain Kang Sheng into the mess, inviting undeserved trouble; once this was over, even if Bai Zhengchu did not make things hard for him or the Commerce Guild, Kang Sheng himself would likely not let it go quietly.

His relationship with Kang Sheng had been built entirely on Saint Crystals — such ties were exceedingly fragile.

"You have some nerve. To bribe this Deputy Commander in front of everyone!" Bai Zhengchu snorted, took Xia Jingwu's Spatial Ring, didn't even look at it, and tossed it to a warrior who had come with him. "The Commerce Guild assaulted people first, defied Purple Star City's laws, and then bribed this Deputy Commander — that increases their crime by three degrees. Seize them all."

"Yes!" a group of warriors shouted as they moved to encircle the members of the Commerce Guild.

Inside the Commerce Guild, aside from Hua Youmeng — an expert at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm — only Gao Hong was at the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; the rest were all at the Saint King Realm. If Hua Youmeng had been uninjured they might have put up a fight, but she had been struck by Xia Jingwu's Flowery Rain Powder. Her whole body was weak and powerless; though her mind was clear she could not draw on her Saint Yuan and could only watch her brothers and sisters be captured.

Before long the members of the Commerce Guild were all taken. Xia Jingwu and Yao Qing were beaten until their faces were bruised.

"We didn't beat anyone — what right have you to take us? I won't accept this!" Yao Qing braced his neck and shouted angrily.

"Oh? You didn't do it? There were so many witnesses outside the city gate; the attackers were your Commerce Guild — do you deny that?" Bai asked.

"If I say we didn't do it, then we didn't!" Yao Qing snarled through gritted teeth.

"Lord Bai..." Gao Hong hesitated for a moment, then called out, "To reply to my lord: the attackers were indeed not members of our Commerce Guild. That person could fell Deacon Min in a single move — how could our humble little Commerce Guild possibly have the means to hire such an expert? My lord is wise and martial; you would not fail to see that, would you?"

Bai Zhengchu narrowed his eyes and looked at Gao Hong, coldly. "Are you accusing this Deputy Commander of failing to distinguish right from wrong and of incompetence?"

"I wouldn't dare," Gao Hong trembled under his pressure, yet her voice held firm. "It's just that if you only take us innocents while the real culprit goes free, if Commander Lu finds out, he may think you are unable to tell right from wrong and incompetent."

"How dare you!" Bai Zhengchu barked, his expression fierce.

Gao Hong forced herself to maintain eye contact with him.

After a while Bai Zhengchu chuckled. "I wouldn't have expected such brazen people in this small Commerce Guild — I like it. Very well, since you say the attacker was not from your Commerce Guild, then... where is he?"

"He's still here!" Gao Hong breathed a sigh of relief and hurriedly answered.

Hua Youmeng's pretty face shifted; she looked at Gao Hong reproachfully.

Gao Hong gave a wry smile. "Chairwoman, that man brought trouble upon himself; we cannot let our Commerce Guild shoulder the blame. Whether you scold me or not, I must name him."

As she spoke, she pressed a point behind Hua Youmeng's back, instantly rendering Hua unable to speak; she could only stare helplessly.

Bai Zhengchu coldly looked at Gao Hong. "The attacker is among your Commerce Guild and you dare say he is not one of yours? Do you take this Deputy Commander for a fool?"

Gao Hong said in a low voice, "Precisely because he isn't from our Commerce Guild I tried to restrain him, waiting for the esteemed lords to arrive so that you could capture the true culprit."

"Smart mouth!" Bai Zhengchu smiled slightly, seemingly pleased. "Fine, lead the way; I want to see which bastard dares to act up in Purple Star City!"

"This way, my lord!" Gao Hong gestured and immediately led the way.

Even while she led them, she did not set the limp Hua Youmeng down, but carried her sideways in her arms.

She squinted toward the partitioned room where Yang Kai sat; her expression flickered and after a moment her eyes hardened as if she had made up her mind. One hand slipped down and her fingers moved subtly, rhythmically.

Xia Jingwu, who followed behind, saw this and his face turned grave.

Before long, under Gao Hong's lead a crowd massed outside the partitioned room where Yang Kai sat.

"My lord, he's inside. If you don't believe me, call him out to confront us and you'll know whether what we said is true," Gao Hong stood to one side and pointed at the room.

Bai Zhengchu paid her no heed; he narrowed his eyes and sent his Divine Sense to sweep inside.

He did sense someone's aura within, but when he tried to probe that person's cultivation he found his Divine Sense could not function at all — it passed through as if into a stone sinking into the sea.

The discovery made Bai Zhengchu's face go slack; he realized the opponent's strength might be considerable.

After all, the person who could wound Deacon Min in a single strike couldn't be weak and would be unlikely to achieve that if they lacked real power.

So he did not dare act recklessly and quickly withdrew his Divine Sense. Still, as a Deputy Commander of Purple Star City who was used to swaggering, he didn't truly hold Yang Kai in regard; he shouted, "Who are you to be harming people in Purple Star City? Show yourself at once!"

There was no response from the room.

Bai Zhengchu's face immediately grew a little embarrassed; he sneered, "Friend, if you're sensible come out yourself. I don't care about your background or your cultivation — anyone who dares act up in Purple Star City won't have a good end. If you cooperate there may be a sliver of hope; otherwise..."

He waited a while longer without reply and grew infuriated, shouting, "Playing tricks—when this Deputy Commander throws you into the Cold Prison we'll see if you can still be so arrogant!"

Saying that, he pointed at five or six warriors beside him. "Go in and bring him out."

Those five or six warriors were no fools; they knew the man inside might be dangerous, but Bai Zhengchu's order had been issued and they dared not disobey, so they steeled themselves and rushed in.

They had expected some commotion, at the very least the sounds of a fight, but to everyone's surprise, after those five or six men entered it was as if they had vanished into thin air — not a sound came out.

Were it not for the fact that their life auras and breaths were still detectable, the crowd might have thought them gone.

Bai Zhengchu's expression grew even more serious.

The members of the Commerce Guild exchanged glances, unsure what had happened inside.

At that moment, several figures shot out from the room, each crashing to the ground and lying motionless.

They were the warriors who had rushed in moments before; each looked tranquilly serene, as if asleep. On the surface there was no sign of injury — one even had the corner of his mouth curled in a smile, as if dreaming of something pleasant.

A hush —

Bai Zhengchu drew in a cold breath. Those warriors were all at the Origin Returning Realm; though only First Stage they were not the sort to be so casually controlled. Even if he had acted personally, he could not have achieved such results.

Who in that room could possibly be responsible? Bai Zhengchu's heart pounded.

But as one of the eight Deputy Commanders of Purple Star City he could not show weakness; his expression shifted and he ordered, "All follow me."

If he failed to subdue this troublemaker today, his position as Deputy Commander would be forfeit. At that moment he could only silently pray the opponent was not at the Void King Realm, for if so they would stand no chance.

A group of people charged into the room with a clatter.

This time there was no silence; immediately the sounds of fighting and cries of alarm erupted. One after another warriors were flung out of the room, tumbling to the ground and howling in pain.

In the space of a blink all who had rushed in were hurled outside, leaving only Bai Zhengchu still inside. From his cries it was clear his situation was dire.

"Now!" Gao Hong, who had been watching coldly, suddenly shouted, threw Hua Youmeng into her arms and shot rapidly into the sky.

Xia Jingwu, who had already caught her meaning, also shouted, "Run!"

Yao Qing and Haitang only then came to their senses and hurriedly followed Xia Jingwu and Gao Hong, trying to take advantage of the chaos to escape.

They had only climbed ten zhang when a horrifying aura met them head-on, pressing down like a heavy cotton quilt. Gao Hong and the others were caught off guard; their bodies halted and they were forced back.

In midair a ripple flashed, and at the very center of that ripple a figure appeared like a specter.
