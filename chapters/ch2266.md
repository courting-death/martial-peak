## Chapter 2266 — Spirit Spring Source

A thousand zhang underground, Yang Kai rose to his full height.

Although this was a rare opportunity to cultivate, and it would likely be difficult to encounter such dense Spiritual Qi again in the future, Yang Kai did not intend to waste this precious time in meditation. He was eager to know what had happened here to cause such a change in the world.

Moreover, he had just made a breakthrough. No matter how much he cultivated now, it would be difficult to make further progress in a short time.

With a slight movement of his Divine Sense, he sent a message to Liu Yan, instructing her to continue standing guard here.

Just as he was about to investigate further, his brow furrowed and he turned to look toward the entrance.

Over there, clothes fluttered and shadows flickered—apparently, quite a few martial artists had come down.

"There are people over there! Someone really did come in ahead of us."

"Damn it, it must be this guy who used some trick and ruined our chance to break through."

"Let’s go see who has such guts."

The noisy shouts reached Yang Kai’s ears, making his mind stir. He quickly released his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings.

Immediately, he discovered the problem: the Spiritual Qi in the area seemed just a bit thinner than before. Though not obvious, it was indeed less dense.

Realizing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but glance toward Liu Yan’s hiding place. He wondered if the thinning of the Spiritual Qi was due to the Xuan Realm Pearl absorbing it.

He didn't underestimate this slight difference. It was likely this very gap that kept these martial artists from reaching the threshold of a breakthrough. That was probably why they had all come down together to investigate the cause.

With this thought, Yang Kai quickly beckoned, retrieving both Liu Yan and the Xuan Realm Pearl to avoid drawing attention; he didn’t want to absorb excess Spiritual Qi and alert the newcomers.

After finishing these actions, he stood quietly in place, waiting.

"Brat, no matter which Sect you’re from, you’re dead this time."

"If you know what’s good for you, come over and apologize to this master. Maybe I’ll spare your life!"

"Ruined my chance, I’ll fight you to the end!"

The group shouted, pinning the blame on Yang Kai without a word of explanation, and quickly approached him.

In no time, the group arrived not far from Yang Kai.

"Ah... it’s you..."

"Th-this..."

After seeing Yang Kai’s face clearly, the martial artists who had been shouting fell silent, each breaking out in a cold sweat and standing awkwardly in place.

The scenes of Yang Kai killing Qu Huairen and taking out Zhuang Pan were still vivid in their minds. Everyone was extremely wary of Yang Kai and didn’t dare provoke him. Each regretted shouting without understanding the situation, unsure if they had angered this fiend.

"Do you all need something?" Yang Kai looked at the group coldly and asked in a frosty tone.

"N-no..."

"Nothing, just came down to take a look, hahaha. The scenery down here is nice, just touring with fellow cultivators..."

"Yes, yes, just sightseeing!"

"Is that so..." Yang Kai’s lips curled up. He said lightly, "Since the scenery is so nice, you all shouldn’t miss it. Go on and have a look around."

"Yes, yes! We’ll go, we’ll go!"

Seeing Yang Kai’s cold expression, no one dared linger. They quickly detoured deeper inside. As they left, many glanced in shock toward where Hua Qingsi was hiding.

With their strength, they could naturally sense Hua Qingsi’s cultivation. The Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm was nothing special—several present were at that level. What shocked them was the faint, mysterious profound intent swirling around Hua Qingsi.

Emperor Intent!

That faint, mysterious profound intent was none other than Emperor Intent—a sign of touching the shackles of the Emperor Realm.

In other words, this woman had a great chance of advancing to the Emperor Realm in the future.

Wasn’t it natural for everyone to be shocked and envious? They didn’t know if Hua Qingsi had already touched Emperor Intent before, or if it was a result of this surge of Spiritual Qi.

But with such an expert here, and the fiend Yang Kai guarding as well, who would dare linger?

In no time, everyone had left completely.

After they left, Yang Kai released Liu Yan again, letting her continue to hide nearby and stand guard.

Then, Yang Kai’s figure flickered as he too ventured deeper inside.

The further he went, the denser the Spiritual Qi became, as if somewhere ahead was the very source of this outpouring.

Yang Kai grew curious, wondering what could cause the Spiritual Qi to surge like this.

The martial artists who had gone ahead were just up ahead.

Suddenly, cries of shock rang out from the front, followed by the sound of people gasping in astonishment.

They seemed to have discovered something incredible.

Yang Kai’s expression changed. With Spatial Law swirling around him, he vanished in a flash.

In the next instant, he appeared beside the group.

Following their gazes, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed.

Not far ahead, a circular pit about ten zhang across had appeared in the ground. From beneath this pit, streams of spirit liquid surged upward like a fountain, spreading mist in all directions as if it were the mouth of a spring.

“A Spirit Source! Heavens, it’s a Spirit Spring Source!”

"There’s actually a Spirit Spring Source here—unbelievable."

"No wonder the Spiritual Qi is so dense. With this Spirit Source, everything makes sense."

"Judging by the scale, it should be a Middle-Grade Spirit Source. If a Sect were established here, it would surely flourish within a hundred years!"

Everyone here was from a mid-tier family or Sect. None of their own families or Sects had a Spirit Source—only top-tier Sects had the right to occupy such a treasure and establish a Sect here.

Everyone was excited, their eyes shining as they imagined what changes would come if their own Sect or family could seize this Spirit Source.

In less than a hundred years, their strength could double and rival the top forces.

"Now... this could be trouble." Someone suddenly said gloomily, then sighed heavily.

"What do you mean? The Spirit Source is right here—how could there be trouble?" someone asked in confusion.

"Yeah, you’re really strange. How could you call such a heaven-sent opportunity trouble? Are you sick?" someone else mocked.

The speaker didn’t argue, just sighed and said, "Have you thought about it? News spread before that there was an Upper-Level Earth Vein and even a mineral vein near Fenglin City. Why didn’t the top Sects get involved?"

"Why else? Upper-Level Earth Veins and Source Crystal mines are impressive, but top Sects wouldn’t care. Only Sects like ours would treat them as treasures."

"Exactly!" The man looked around. "But what if news of a Spirit Source here gets out?"

At those words, everyone fell silent, their expressions changing as they realized the key point.

If news of the Spirit Source spread, they’d have no part in it. The top Sects would send experts to seize the place and set up branches.

These mid-tier families and Sects couldn’t possibly compete and would have to hand over this delicious feast...

At this thought, everyone’s mood turned gloomy, the earlier excitement gone.

"How about... we all swear a heart demon oath not to spread the news?" someone suggested quietly.

The others glanced at him as if he were an idiot, eyes full of ridicule.

There are no walls in the world that don’t leak. No matter how they tried to hide it, news of the Spirit Source would eventually reach the top Sects.

Besides, many of the Sects and families here survived by relying on those big Sects. After seeing such a treasure, they’d surely report it as soon as they left.

How could it possibly be kept secret?

"I was just saying..." The one who suggested it quickly realized his mistake and fell silent, embarrassed.

"Boom..."

At that moment, a loud boom came from ahead, and spirit liquid erupted skyward, turning into spirit rain that fell all around.

"What?"

"What’s going on?"

"Heavens, are you kidding me?"

"Another... another Spirit Source!"

After a moment of shock, everyone stared wide-eyed at a spot about fifty zhang away, where another Spirit Source had just formed, with spirit liquid gushing upward like a fountain.

The underground Spiritual Qi instantly became much denser.

Yang Kai was completely stunned, standing there dumbfounded.

Spirit Sources were things one could only hope to encounter. For a top Sect to occupy a Spirit Source and turn it into a Sacred Land was already a great fortune.

Yet here, two thousand li beneath Fenglin City, two Spirit Sources had appeared at once, right next to each other. Judging by their scale, both were Middle-Grade.

"Boom, boom, boom..."

As if their shock wasn’t enough, more booming explosions erupted, the ground trembled, and rocks fell as the Spiritual Qi became indescribably dense in an instant.

Several martial artists who had failed to break through earlier due to thin Spiritual Qi now felt their internal energy surge, showing signs of another imminent breakthrough.

But at this moment, they couldn’t care about themselves and stood there dumbfounded, looking around.

Underground, the light was dim and the air thick with Spiritual Qi, making it impossible to see. But everyone here was at least Dao Origin Realm, so with Divine Sense, they could see everything clearly.

To their shock, one Spirit Source after another appeared. In no time, the underground area within a radius of ten thousand zhang was filled with Spirit Sources, each not far from the next.
