## Chapter 1976 — Fenglin City

Fenglin City was more prosperous and flourishing than any city Yang Kai had seen in his native Star Domain, even surpassing the Shuitian City of the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

But within the Star Realm it was merely one of countless obscure cities, and even when viewed across the entire Southern Territory it did not particularly stand out.

Yang Kai was truly astonished.

The only thing that made him a little disdainful was that entering the city required paying ten Lower-Level Source Crystals!

It pained him greatly.

He was no longer like he had been in his native Star Domain; every Source Crystal was now extraordinarily precious to him, and he naturally dared not use them lightly.

The Source Crystals in his hand had all been taken from the Spatial Rings of Biyu Sect disciples; there were not many, only a few thousand.

He had originally had four Spatial Rings, and even a ring belonging to a First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm warrior, but Yang Kai had given three rings to Liu Qianyun and kept only one for himself.

Besides the few thousand Source Crystals, the ring contained only two Secret Treasures of middling grade and some miscellaneous materials that were of little use.

After entering Fenglin City, he did not hurry to find lodgings; instead he walked about, observing and listening to the conversations of the surrounding warriors in order to gather intelligence useful to him.

By the end of a day he had gained quite a lot.

As he had expected, the combat strength of the warriors in Fenglin City was not particularly great; even some of the surrounding small forces lacked truly powerful experts to hold them.

The city lord, Duan Yuanshan, was a Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm warrior; the two deputy city lords were First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm warriors. The three of them governed all of Fenglin City, and among the minor families in the city, aside from the Jiang Family — which had an old ancestor at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm — there were no other Dao Origin Realm level warriors.

Most of the nearby small forces likewise only had First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm warriors stationed; only the Blazing Fire Hall counted one Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, faintly able to contend with the city lord's mansion of Fenglin City.

However Yang Kai knew that the Blazing Fire Hall's Hall Master Luo had already perished on Yuqing Mountain, and before long the power balance around Fenglin City would likely change.

The tragedy at Yuqing Mountain had already reached Fenglin City and was spreading rapidly throughout the Southern Territory; after all a Divine Spirit, Luan Feng, had manifested, and that would surely attract the attention and investigation of many experts.

Of course this was not something Yang Kai needed to worry about; what concerned him was whether Fenglin City could become his temporary foothold.

As things looked now, it seemed it could.

The absence of very powerful warriors meant he would not face too great a threat. He had ample time to grow stronger slowly.

So after gathering sufficient intelligence, Yang Kai immediately decided to remain in Fenglin City for the time being; at the very least he would first convert the power within his body into Origin Qi before making other plans.

When night fell he went to an annex beside the city lord's mansion and had the duty staff there process his identity plaque and the various formalities.

After the whole fuss, three thousand Source Crystals had been spent; the distressed Yang Kai ground his teeth.

Though the expense was great, it meant he could live in Fenglin City in peace for a year, and he had secured a decent abode.

The dwelling had been constructed by the Fenglin City city lord's mansion and could be rented by any outsider warrior; of course, the fees varied according to the quality of the dwelling.

Yang Kai did not skimp on this because he knew cultivation speed was closely tied to a good environment, so he rented a fairly upper-grade dwelling.

Leaving the annex and after some additional trouble finding the location, he finally arrived at his lodgings.

Using his identity plaque to unlock the dwelling's wards, Yang Kai entered.

Calling it a dwelling was flattering — it was simply a well-built house, equipped with several fine arrays to prevent outside prying.

Yang Kai walked around inside and found it acceptable. The Spiritual Qi within the dwelling was far denser than in the city, apparently due to an array used to gather Spiritual Qi, and there were several rooms with different functions available for his use.

He had no great demands; as long as there was a place to stay it would do.

The night passed uneventfully; Yang Kai merely sat cross-legged, converting Origin Qi while restoring his spirit.

He only stepped out of the dwelling the following day.

Walking the streets and watching the varied warriors and the bustling thoroughfare, Yang Kai's thoughts wandered.

When he had first entered the Star Domain back then, his mood had been much the same — full of curiosity and a desire to explore, taking steps from weakness toward strength.

If he could do it then, he reasoned, he could surely do it now!

At that thought Yang Kai's gaze grew firm.

Only... he did not know how his two great supports, nor Ai Ou and Ghost Ancestor, were faring now or where they were. If they had not been scattered, the combined strength of everyone would certainly be better than his going it alone.

Yang Kai shook his head, did not ponder further, and strode onward.

Before long he stopped in front of a shop called the "Spiritual Pill Shop"; after mulling it over for a moment, he went inside.

The shop assistant across the counter immediately bowed and bustled over, saying, "What can I get for you, guest? Not to brag, but our Spiritual Pill Shop has everything — fair prices and honest dealings for young and old alike. I guarantee we have whatever pill you need. And between you and me, we enjoy the city lord's patronage here, so you have no need to worry about counterfeit goods."

The shop assistant put on a mysterious air and lowered his voice.

Yang Kai smiled faintly; he knew the assistant said that to every customer. Still, this Spiritual Pill Shop likely enjoyed the city lord’s patronage, and in Fenglin City no one would dare speak carelessly—otherwise they’d be risking far more than a few lives.

"I'm not here to buy Spiritual Pills," Yang Kai said, waving his hand.

"Then what does the guest need?" The shop assistant had a good disposition and smiled, "We only sell Spiritual Pills, nothing else."

"Pill formulas — do you have any?" Yang Kai asked, raising an eyebrow.

The shop assistant frowned and forced a smile, "This... I can't decide on my own; please wait a moment, I'll ask the proprietor."

Yang Kai nodded.

The shop assistant immediately turned and went inside.

The reason he had come to purchase pill recipes was entirely related to what he had experienced during the month he had spent refining pills at the Biyu Sect.

Although he had been welcomed at the Biyu Sect and had gained the favor of many disciples, many of the pills warriors requested were ones Yang Kai had never even heard of, let alone been able to refine.

After all, the Star Realm's materials and produce were far richer than those of the Star Domain; many medicinal materials unseen in the Star Domain were common in the Star Realm, which had promoted the development of pill refinement and produced countless different formulas. The refining knowledge Yang Kai possessed was sufficient for the Star Domain but somewhat lacking in the Star Realm.

He wanted to cultivate and thus needed to earn Source Crystals, and the only method he could conceive was to return to his old trade and refine pills for others.

Improving his own formulas was preparatory work — sharpening the axe before cutting wood.

Moreover, Yang Kai urgently needed a formula — the formula for the Origin Condensing Pill!

The Origin Condensing Pill's function was to help Void King Realm warriors convert the strength in their bodies into Origin Qi, and it was highly prized among Void King Realm warriors. After all, once one reached that level advancement became extremely difficult, requiring opportunities and time; compared with realm advancement, converting Origin Qi could likewise raise combat power.

Void King Realm warriors naturally required large numbers of Origin Condensing Pills to assist them, shortening the time needed to convert Origin Qi.

When Yang Kai had advanced to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, the starlight within his body had been exhausted and the speed of converting Origin Qi had suddenly slowed; to increase that speed he had to rely on the Origin Condensing Pill.

Furthermore, this kind of pill was extremely popular among Void King Realm warriors and commanded high prices; the materials were not too hard to obtain, so as long as he could buy the formula for this Spiritual Pill, Yang Kai could start refining it.

Even if he only refined Origin Condensing Pills, Yang Kai believed he could make a fortune.

While waiting he wandered through the Spiritual Pill Shop and saw many Spiritual Pills he had never heard of, their effects strange and varied, which tempted him greatly.

As a pill refiner he naturally longed for formulas, and he quietly planned how best to approach someone to purchase one.

Not long after, the shop assistant returned smiling and said, "Guest, our proprietor requests that you come inside for a chat!"

Yang Kai raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised; after all he had only come to inquire about a formula and had never met the proprietor. Why such enthusiasm? Thinking it through, he found it reasonable and nodded, "Very well, thank you."

"This way, please!" The shop assistant courteously led the way, and soon brought Yang Kai to a side room; he gave a signal and bowed out.

Yang Kai knocked on the door; from inside a somewhat hoarse voice immediately called, "Come in!"

Pushing the door open, the room smelled of sandalwood incense and was simply decorated. A slightly elderly man stood with his hands behind his back; upon seeing Yang Kai he smiled and cupped his fist, "I am Kang Siran, proprietor of the Spiritual Pill Shop. How should I address the guest?"

"Yang Kai pays his respects, Shopkeeper Kang," Yang Kai replied with a smile.

Kang Siran nodded, gave Yang Kai a once‑over, and with a brightened look said, "Young Master Yang, you're truly promising beyond your years."

Yang Kai naturally knew this compliment came from discerning his cultivation, and Kang Siran himself was plainly a Third Stage of the Void King Realm warrior.

Yang Kai could feel that his own power was very pure and not chaotic; evidently it had all been converted to Origin Qi, and with the right opportunity he might even advance to the Dao Origin Realm.

Hearing such praise, Yang Kai modestly thanked him.

“Come, Young Master Yang, please sit. Have a taste of this Rain Maple First Bud personally brewed by this old man!” As Kang Siran spoke, he warmly filled Yang Kai’s cup with steaming tea, its fragrance instantly spreading through the air.

Kang Siran pushed the teacup toward Yang Kai and gestured for him to taste.
