## Chapter 369 — I Owe You Nothing

The name Shan Qingluo is not something to be mentioned lightly.

Seeing the young master of their family behaving so boldly, the two Blood Servants immediately cast sidelong glances, their expressions colorful and varied.

Ah! Qiu Yimeng, the young lady of the Qiu Family, a prominent figure in Zhongdu, the target of admiration from various young masters of great families; no one has ever dared to treat her this way.

Yet, after being treated so, she didn’t retaliate, instead struggling like an ordinary woman.

Gazing at each other, both could see the excitement in one another's eyes.

There’s something fishy about this! Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian pondered in their hearts.

“Let go!” Qiu Yimeng exclaimed, unable to break free; she shouted in a muffled voice.

Yang Kai shot her a threatening glance before slowly loosening his grip, stepping back a few paces.

Frowning slightly, Yang Kai remarked indifferently, “I don’t owe you anything; your circumstances are merely self-inflicted and have nothing to do with me.”

“Heartless and ungrateful!” Qiu Yimeng bit her delicate lip.

“Don’t say such easily misunderstood words; we are merely strangers meeting by chance, with no bonds of affection!” Yang Kai snorted coldly.

Qiu Yimeng immediately felt frustrated, realizing that her usual methods, which had always worked wonders in the past, had no effect on Yang Kai. If used on other young masters of Zhongdu, they would surely delight in it, wagging their tails in joy; how could he treat her so indifferently?

“I have many questions for you. Is there a suitable place to talk?” Yang Kai glanced around.

Qiu Yimeng pouted. After a moment’s thought, she nodded and said, “Follow me.”

The surrounding disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion all appeared bewildered, feeling utterly confused.

They hadn’t heard the conversation between Yang Kai and Qiu Yimeng; they had only witnessed the ambiguous scene.

They recognized Qiu Yimeng, but it seemed that Yang Kai and she were old acquaintances, and their relationship appeared rather deep.

What capabilities does he possess to establish rapport with a prominent figure like the young lady of the Qiu Family?

Not long after the group departed, Jie Hongchen, covered in dust, descended from the sky, having chased for so long. He hadn’t managed to catch even a single feather of the Golden Feather Eagle and had nearly been injured by it.

Upon landing, he suddenly found Yang Kai had vanished without a trace.

“Where is Yang Kai?” Jie Hongchen inquired coldly of those around him.

“He was invited away by Miss Qiu,” responded a junior brother nearby.

“Invited away?” Jie Hongchen raised an eyebrow in disbelief. “Are you sure it was an invitation?”

The junior brother observed the expressions of those around him, not daring to be too certain; he hesitantly replied, “It seems he was called away by Miss Qiu.”

Only then did Jie Hongchen nod in satisfaction, but he soon became suspicious. Why would Qiu Yimeng call him over? Shouldn’t this place be under my control now? What qualifications does he have to be called over?

In confusion, he hurried toward the place where Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman were temporarily resting.

Inside a simple dwelling, Qiu Yimeng, Luo Xiaoman, and Yang Kai sat on one side of a table.

The house was quite humble, with few furnishings. It was evident that it had been newly built, presumably to accommodate Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman.

Outside, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian stood like gatekeepers, unyielding, their expressions cold and stern.

The young lady personally poured tea. Only after taking her seat did she tuck a stray strand of hair behind her ear and look at Yang Kai, saying, “Feel free to ask any questions you have!”

“When did she let you go?” Yang Kai casually asked while picking up the teacup.

“A month ago, I believe,” Qiu Yimeng replied with a bitter smile, knowing full well that the “she” Yang Kai mentioned referred to the Enchantress Queen Shan Qingluo. “She certainly did not make things difficult for us; she simply took us on a tour of the battlefield and allowed us to leave before the final battle began.”

“What did you gain from it?”

“My perspective has changed quite a bit, heh.” After a moment of contemplation, Qiu Yimeng sincerely said, “I used to think everyone from Cangyun Evil Land deserved death, but now I dare not think that way. I saw many innocent people cruelly slaughtered by those who consider themselves just. I also witnessed many external forces committing atrocities within Cangyun Evil Land. She was right; this world is not merely black and white; every person harbors darkness, and everyone has the potential to become a demon, depending only on whether they can uphold their true hearts.”

“Hmm.” Yang Kai nodded lightly; Qiu Yimeng was indeed undergoing a rare transformation.

Bringing her to the battlefield was the right move for Shan Qingluo.

Perhaps Shan Qingluo hoped that with the strength of the Qiu Family, she could change the world’s perception of Cangyun Evil Land, hence all this trouble.

“After we returned, I came here.” A smile brightened Qiu Yimeng’s face.

“Does your Qiu Family know that you are safe?” Yang Kai furrowed his brows.

“Letters have already been sent back,” Qiu Yimeng nodded. “There has also been news from Ziwei Valley; as for the Bai Family…”

Yang Kai’s gaze sharpened, firmly locking onto Qiu Yimeng.

She chuckled softly, “Heh, don’t be so tense. I and Xiaoman informed the Bai Family that Bai Yunfeng was unfortunately killed by the Thunder Beast King’s subordinates, and it has nothing to do with you and that woman.”

“Then that’s best!” Yang Kai smiled contentedly. Although Bai Yunfeng’s death was indeed unrelated to him, if the truth were to come out, the Bai Family would certainly not let it go easily.

Those powerful clans are notorious for being unreasonable; otherwise, Lingxiao Pavilion would not have encountered disaster.

Qiu Yimeng slowly stretched, her graceful figure exposed, yet she seemed unfazed, lazily stating, “I once told you that if one day I could escape, I would definitely help clear Lingxiao Pavilion’s name! However, I currently lack that capability, so for now, I can only focus on rebuilding here before considering further plans.”

Though she was the young lady of the Qiu Family, lifting the name of Lingxiao Pavilion was indeed a major matter, not something she could decide on her own.

At the very least, it required a spokesperson from a superforce to take the lead.

“Are you in charge of the rebuilding work here?” Yang Kai gazed at her in surprise.

“Who else could it be?” Qiu Yimeng giggled, “Lingxiao Pavilion has been labeled an evil sect. If I don’t step forward, who would dare to build here? I originally planned to treat this place as a property of the Qiu Family, waiting for a chance to restore Lingxiao Pavilion later, so as to repay you a favor.”

“That’s not returning me a favor; it’s what your Qiu Family ought to do.” Yang Kai sneered.

Qiu Yimeng was taken aback but did not argue, nodding, “That makes sense. After all, it was my Qiu Family people who set this place on fire. But regardless, you’ve returned now, and you can be considered someone with a background. Just treat this place as your own property for now, and I’m too lazy to get involved. Hehe, who would dare to say anything regarding the property of the Young Master of the Yang Family?”

Yang Kai was stunned for a moment but did not refuse. After pondering for a long while, he found it indeed a good idea and nodded, saying, “Thank you.”

Qiu Yimeng’s eyes brightened, and she smiled happily.

“However, what’s going on with those people outside? Where did you find them?” Yang Kai inquired with uncertainty.

“Nearby,” Qiu Yimeng chuckled, resting her chin on her hand, appearing a bit lazy. “They are all people who relied on two nearby sects. I spoke to the upper echelons of those two sects, and they brought them back.”

Yang Kai instantly understood.

The people outside should all be the disciples who initially allied with Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang! What he hadn’t expected was that Jie Hongchen, a core disciple, had also left Lingxiao Pavilion before the great disaster struck. Yet, someone like Li Yuntian stayed resolutely, ultimately escaping thousands of li away through the Void Passage.

Time tests a horse's strength, and the heart reveals itself over time.

However, Yang Kai held no particular thoughts on it. It was their freedom to choose to leave the sect back then.

Those individuals were given shelter by Fengyu Tower and Blood Battle Gang, and now that Qiu Yimeng has stepped forward to retrieve them, with her identity as the young lady of the Qiu Family, how could Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower dare to protest?

“One's own sect should be reconstructed by their own people to truly retain its flavor, don’t you agree?” Qiu Yimeng said with a giggle, her gaze eager, seemingly awaiting Yang Kai's praise.

Yang Kai remained indifferent, simply glancing at Luo Xiaoman, who grinned at him like a little tiger showing her teeth.

Qiu Yimeng immediately rolled her eyes, knowing that this guy was playing dumb, and did not press the issue.

“By the way, when you arrived here, was there anything particularly special nearby?” Yang Kai suddenly recalled something.

“Something special?”

“Yeah, like killing intent or evil energy.” Yang Kai straightened his face.

“Oh, you mean that?” Qiu Yimeng smiled slightly, “We didn’t see anything unusual when we came, but I heard from your fellow disciple Jie Hongchen that the Dragon Confinement Ravine had once been filled with evil energy. Initially, the two nearby sects had planned to relocate, but it seems something down there was devouring the evil energy, and after several months, the area became calm.”

“Has anyone gone down to investigate?” Yang Kai couldn’t help but feel a bit tense.

The thing devouring the evil energy, others did not know what it was, but Yang Kai was clear on it.

Di Mo!

Upon returning here, Yang Kai sensed a bit but found no trace or aura of Di Mo. He should have succeeded, but it was unknown where it had gone.

Could it be that this old demon wants to take advantage of the opportunity to escape my control? Yang Kai’s thoughts turned, considering a possibility.

It wasn’t impossible; Di Mo was a genuine demon, notoriously untrustworthy and devoid of morals.

“No one has gone down to investigate; the nearby martial artists deeply avoid the Dragon Confinement Ravine!” Qiu Yimeng slowly shook her head.

This was understandable; who knew if there was still danger down there? When the evil energy had surged before, anyone could feel the lethal threat; now that it was calm and peaceful, no one dared to gamble their lives.

“Do you know what’s down there?” Qiu Yimeng suddenly became alert, her eyes shining as she stared at Yang Kai.

“I don’t know,” Yang Kai shook his head.

Qiu Yimeng pouted, realizing he didn’t trust her much and held considerable reservations.

“Forget it, let’s not discuss this; let’s talk about your sect’s rebuilding. I’ve already dawdled here for quite a while; although I’ve sent word back to Zhongdu, I should return home quickly, or my family will probably send someone looking for me again,” Qiu Yimeng said sorrowfully, seemingly reluctant to return to Zhongdu. “So, I think I’ll leave the rebuilding of this place to your fellow disciples; I won’t intervene. Everything will be handed over to Jie Hongchen; what do you think?”
