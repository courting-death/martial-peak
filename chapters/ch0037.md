## Chapter 37 — The Challenge Letter

The next day, Yang Kai was awakened by a sudden knocking at the door.

After getting up and opening it, he found no one outside. However, from a distance, a familiar figure was swiftly retreating.

It was Li Yuntian!

What was this fellow up to? Yang Kai felt puzzled. Just as he was about to wonder further, he noticed a letter raft lying on the ground by the doorway. Bending down to pick it up, he opened it and immediately felt a mix of amusement and disbelief.

The letter contained some words, and they were written in fresh blood.

"Senior Brother, personally addressed to you. It has been many days since we last met, and your Junior Brother misses you deeply. I hereby invite you to meet at Black Wind Forest. I hope you will not refuse! Written by your Junior Brother, Su Mu."

The characters were bright red, clearly penned in blood. Yang Kai wondered whether it was chicken’s blood or something else, but he was certain Su Mu wouldn’t harm himself for this.

Following this formal invitation was a line of words that stood in stark contrast to the refined tone above.

"Come if you dare!"

These four characters were written with overwhelming momentum, the brush strokes brimming with deep-seated resentment and provocation.

It seemed Su Mu feared Yang Kai would ignore his invitation, so he added this line at the end. Young men were most easily provoked by such taunts, and Su Mu had experienced this countless times—he was a seasoned master of the art of provocation.

Holding this blood-written challenge letter in hand, Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

He didn’t take Su Mu’s provocation to heart. Perhaps Su Mu truly bore a grudge, but Yang Kai did not. Their mindsets and perspectives were different. Such petty squabbles were merely a crucible to test his cultivation achievements.

Although their initial meeting had been unpleasant, and Su Mu had repeatedly sought to cause trouble, over the past days Yang Kai realized that Su Mu was not inherently bad—just a bit of a spoiled brat.

With such people, if you befriend them, they treat you well; if you make enemies, they cling like leeches, endlessly vexing you.

Su Mu and his group had been avoiding Yang Kai these past days. Now, for some reason, they had regained confidence in defeating him and dared to issue a challenge.

Yang Kai had initially been reluctant to respond, but while sweeping the floor, he reconsidered and decided to pay a visit.

Su Mu was undoubtedly a true scoundrel. He disregarded sect rules by issuing a challenge letter instead of a formal duel, likely planning to gang up on Yang Kai.

The chosen location spoke volumes: Black Wind Forest, lying beneath Black Wind Mountain, was a pine forest—an ideal place for underhanded tactics and ambushes.

Though Su Mu’s group was numerous, only Su Mu himself had reached Body Tempering Realm Stage Nine, Li Yuntian was at Stage Seven, and the others hovered around Stage Five or Six. Yang Kai was unsure if he could handle such opponents, but he needed a proper battle to test his cultivation, something beyond mere sparring with fellow disciples.

At this moment, Su Mu and his companions waited boldly on the only path from Lingxiao Pavilion to Black Wind Forest. They made no attempt to hide, standing there with heads held high.

Recalling the embarrassing night when they were suddenly ambushed and knocked unconscious, Su Mu’s expression darkened. That night, for some unknown reason, the brothers who had gone to Yang Kai’s hut all fainted. Everything had happened so mysteriously.

They only awoke the next morning. Though it was summer and sleeping outdoors wasn’t cold, the sheer number of mosquitoes was unbearable. Upon waking, each felt as if hundreds of welts covered their bodies, their blood drained by the relentless insects.

For several days afterward, Su Mu and his comrades lay bedridden, utterly weak.

Once recovered, led by Su Mu, the brothers stormed out of Lingxiao Pavilion. If they couldn’t confront Yang Kai, how could they continue hiding?

Only yesterday, Li Yuntian had mastered a new martial technique, rekindling Su Mu’s desire for revenge. This prompted Li Yuntian to deliver the challenge letter, inviting Yang Kai to battle in Black Wind Forest.

They chose not to challenge within the sect because Su Mu did not have much faith in Li Yuntian. If Li Yuntian lost again, the rest would swarm Yang Kai, disregarding sect rules and morality, and beat him senseless. The grudge in their hearts would only be relieved by such an outcome.

As Su Mu pondered this, Li Yuntian hurried over.

“Was it delivered?” Su Mu asked, his gaze sharp and fierce.

“Yes.”

“Good. Let that bastard come.”

Time passed, but Yang Kai’s figure did not appear. Growing impatient, Su Mu paced back and forth, cursing, “That bastard doesn’t have the courage to show up, does he?”

Just as he cursed, Li Yuntian suddenly said, “Su Shao, someone is coming.”

“Hm?” Su Mu’s spirits lifted, thinking Yang Kai had indeed come to meet his death. But upon closer look, the newcomer was not Yang Kai.

“Su Shao, they’re from Fengyu Tower,” Li Yuntian said, staring at the approaching group. “The leader looks like Cheng Shaofeng!”

“Cheng Shaofeng?” Su Mu’s expression turned cold as he looked up to see Cheng Shaofeng leading a large group, striding over with great momentum.

“Su Shao, should we avoid them?” Li Yuntian hesitated. He knew Su Mu and Cheng Shaofeng had a long-standing grudge. As leading figures at the Body Tempering Realm in their respective sects, they had clashed many times in recent years, with victories on both sides. If they met now, friction was inevitable.

“Avoid? Hmph,” Su Mu snorted coldly. “Does he have the right to make me yield?”

Li Yuntian did not press further, knowing this was a matter of pride. Su Mu was too proud to back down. However, with the opponent’s numbers, a fight would likely put them at a disadvantage.

As they spoke, Cheng Shaofeng spotted Su Mu from afar and brightened. He signaled his group and quickened his pace.

Soon, the two groups met. The road Su Mu’s group occupied was the only path from Lingxiao Pavilion to Black Wind Forest, but it was also the route from Fengyu Tower to Black Wind Forest. This was a four-way intersection, with one path leading to Lingxiao Pavilion, another to Fengyu Tower, and a third to the Blood Battle Gang.

By standing there, Su Mu’s group blocked Cheng Shaofeng’s way.

“Who’s so blind to not see where they’re going? Oh, it’s Su Mu!” Cheng Shaofeng stepped forward, sneering as he sized up Su Mu with a mocking tone.

Su Mu rolled his eyes but stood firm like a spear, not even bothering to respond.

This blatant disregard slightly soured Cheng Shaofeng’s expression.

“Heh heh heh, Cheng brother, no one’s paying attention to you,” a clear, melodious laugh rang out. The voice was pleasant but carried a wild, uninhibited air.

Su Mu turned toward the sound and saw a charming young woman emerge behind Cheng Shaofeng. She wore a loose top that revealed one shoulder, her skin shining like porcelain. Her skirt concealed her shapely hips but exposed her slender, fair legs. Her feet, clad in wooden shoes, were delicate and exquisite, her fingers crystal-clear and rounded, captivating anyone’s gaze.
