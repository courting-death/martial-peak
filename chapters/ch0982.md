## Chapter 982 — Breaking Free, Transcendence

That sort of behavior was like a beggar asking for someone else's favor; Qiu Yimeng could not bring herself to stoop that low.

"Don't be afraid, I support you—this chance may never come again." An Ling'er continued her gentle coaxing.

Qiu Yimeng seemed slightly moved by her words and pondered carefully for a moment, then suddenly shook her head, stood up and said, "Let's wait for him to come back, wait until the next time he returns... I won't let him off again! Good night, Miss An. I'll go rest now."

"Hey, don't go, I'm all alone..." An Ling'er called out, waving, but Qiu Yimeng soon vanished from sight.

Heavy panting and moans sounded again by her ears, mingled with what seemed like the crashing of waves against a shore. An Ling’er bit her red lips, curling her body into a ball, covering her ears with both hands as she muttered curses under her breath—cursing Yang Kai to never again be able to perform as a man, and that tonight would be his last supper…

The next day, Yang Kai and Xia Ningshang walked out of the Saint Lord Courtyard together.

Outside the Saint Lord Courtyard stood a dense throng: leaders of various factions from the Great Han, Yang Family brothers and elders, the Sacred Land's elders, several commanders of the Ancient Demon Clan, twenty or thirty Saint-Grade alchemists, Elder Tianzang, Li Rui and his disciple Zhai Yao...

They all seemed to be waiting in silent expectation for Yang Kai to appear.

When he emerged, beams of gazes shot toward him in unison, heavy with meaning.

Xia Ningshang's cheeks flushed; she couldn't help shrinking back behind Yang Kai, her walk awkward and not quite natural.

Anyone could see that Xia Ningshang was radiant now, more beautiful than before, as if she had been secretly nourished.

Having been through similar things, everyone knew what had happened.

Yang Kai let out a loud laugh, cupped his fist and said, "Why are you all here?"

"To see you off!" Elder Li stepped forward. "You're leaving today, aren't you?"

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded. "Thank you all."

"No more words—be careful on the road. If it's something you cannot manage, return as soon as possible!" Elder Li said tersely.

“This junior will remember it well.” Yang Kai replied earnestly.

Fourth Master Yang and his wife also came forward; Dong Suzhu, full of reluctance, kept piling on exhortations, and Yang Kai answered each one.

"Boy, you must come back safely—Ningshang more than anyone doesn't want anything to happen to you," Meng Wuya murmured in Yang Kai's ear.

"I know." Yang Kai promised solemnly. "I won't let Little Senior Sister down."

"I hope you can," Meng Wuya said, drawing a deep breath.

Bidding farewell to one familiar face after another and hearing their concern warmed Yang Kai's heart and spirit.

After a brief word with the Sacred Land's elders and farewells to Li Rong and the others, Yang Kai arranged everything, kissed Little Senior Sister's forehead, whispered vows in her ear, then summoned the Star Shuttle, which transformed into a streak of azure light and vanished.

He set off on a new journey.

Everyone stood before the Saint Lord Courtyard, waving farewell to him.

Only after Yang Kai's figure gradually disappeared did Elder Yu Ying sigh softly, "Ling'er, don't cry—Saint Lord will surely return."

"Who said I was crying?" An Ling'er blinked, puzzled.

"Then why are your eyes so red?" Elder Yu Ying pursed her lips and smiled, thinking she was too shy to admit it.

"My eyes are red because..." An Ling'er opened her mouth, recalling the events of the previous night, and found she couldn't bring herself to say it.

Glancing at the veiled Miss Xia, her face streaked with tears and full of reluctance, An Ling'er could only admire her to the utmost!

Last night she had stood outside the Saint Lord Courtyard watching the stars all night...

The two of them had such abundant spirit and physical strength, and most remarkable of all was how this Miss Xia managed to look so radiant after rising early.

An Ling'er couldn't figure out what exactly had caused it.

After Yang Kai departed, a few days later the Ancient Demon Clan, led by Li Rong and several commanders, also left the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and, according to their prior agreement with Changyuan, headed for the Demon Domain.

Di Mo went with them!

He was, after all, one of the demonfolk. Only in the Demon Domain could he have the best environment for cultivation, and given his special circumstances, it wouldn't take more than a dozen or two years for him to reach the Third Stage of the Saint Realm and become another demon general within the Demon Domain.

The Hu family sisters also left the old War Soul Hall and went to the Twin Pavilion for secluded cultivation.

Meng Wuya remained to guard the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

The old War Soul Hall site saw the Great Han's various powers using the resources sent from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land to bury themselves in development.

Nearly thirty Saint-Grade alchemists treated the Nine Heavens Sacred Land almost as the Alchemists' Council; none of them wished to leave, because the elusive Elder Li had informed them that he and his disciple would settle here and no longer roam the world.

Elder Li likewise became the nominal chief alchemist of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

With Elder Li and Xia Ningshang present, why would those Saint-Grade alchemists leave? They invented excuses and lingered here, refusing to go.

In an instant, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land became perhaps the most powerful force on the entire continent, making every other sect and family pale in comparison.

Everything prospered.

......

The starry sky stretched vast and boundless.

In the cold, black starry void, Yang Kai steered the Star Shuttle and kept pressing forward.

He had entered the starry sky from the Ice Sect's entrance—since Ice Lord Qing Ya had brought Su Yan into the void that way, he hoped to find some trace.

Unfortunately, there was nothing to be found.

He didn't know where he should go or where he might find living beings; the only certainty was that there were indeed other lifeforms in this dark, frigid starry sky.

The Bone Clan had made their way into the Tongxuan Continent in exactly this manner.

He hoped that one day he would discover some sign of life.

The Star Shuttle shed its azure light and flashed through the vast starry sky, and a thin veil of light covered Yang Kai, shielding his body from the void's corrosive influence.

Without the Star Shuttle, Yang Kai would not have been able to travel far through the Starry Sky, as he would have had to constantly burn his own strength to resist the overwhelming pressure there.  

By comparison, the strength he consumed to operate the Star Shuttle was far less!

He had no idea how long he'd been drifting in the starry sky; his First Stage of the Saint Realm cultivation had long since stabilized, and he had even spent a good while cultivating on the Star Shuttle.

Still there had been no special discoveries.

His experiences resembled the Great Demon God's early explorations of the starry sky: braving starry storms and venturing into the Meteorite Sea, drifting along with the meteorites.

Everywhere he'd been, there was no trace of life.

Yang Kai grew confused. He did not know what fate awaited him if he continued exploring like this.

Perhaps he would forever get lost in this void and grow old alone.

But he wasn't about to give up—Su Yan was still somewhere in this starry void.

One day, with nothing else to do, he took out the Demon God's Secret Codex, let the Star Shuttle fly on, and quietly studied the codex in his hands.

Since he obtained that Demon God's Secret Codex, his life had undergone unimaginable, earth-shattering change; Yang Kai knew that his achievements to date were inseparable from that codex.

From that codex he had gained the Indomitable Golden Body, the World-Ending Demon Eye, and the Great Demon God's inheritance.

The Great Demon God had seemingly arranged the path of his life before dying.

But now, at this moment, he had embarked on the same late-life goal as the Great Demon God—to explore the starry sky.

And at this very moment he had stepped beyond the path the Great Demon God had once set for him.

Yang Kai believed that in the near future he would surpass the Great Demon God and achieve what the Great Demon God had not—he would outshine his predecessor.

"Huh..." Lost in thought, Yang Kai suddenly froze, frowning as he stared at the Demon God's Secret Codex in his hands.

He noticed that from all directions, threads of starlight had condensed into currents of energy and were converging into the codex.

At the same time, the Divine Tree, which had been placed inside the codex, sent word to him.

Yang Kai listened for a moment, then nodded in reply, "I'm coming in now."

Saying this, his spirit body suddenly slipped into the Demon God's Secret Codex, closely examining where the star-light currents were flowing.

It turned out to be those two jet-black spheres.

Those two strange jet-black spheres had given Yang Kai too many questions; even to this day he didn't know what they were for.

They had absorbed the essence of countless minerals; veins like human meridians had grown across their surfaces, and within them rhythmic pulsations could be felt.

As if they possessed life of their own!

And at this moment, the energy flowing out of the starry sky was being absorbed by those two jet-black spheres.

After absorbing the star-power, those surface veins grew increasingly refined and distinct, and the internal pulsations gradually intensified.

"I think they seem to be alive," the Divine Tree suddenly transmitted. Having remained in the codex, it had had plenty of time to observe the two spheres and knew them better than Yang Kai. "They give me the same feeling as this Moonlight Herb—very similar!"

"You mean they might be Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects?" Yang Kai raised his brow.

"Who knows. Why don't you cut them open and see?" the Divine Tree suggested.

"Better not. If they really are Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects, cutting them open would be too wasteful," Yang Kai shook his head. "They've already changed a lot compared to before. Keep watching them—if anything goes wrong, tell me immediately."

"Understood," the Divine Tree replied.

Whatever they truly were, Yang Kai believed that with patience he would eventually uncover the truth.

He wasn't in any hurry to put the Demon God's Secret Codex away; he left it out to let the star-power flow in and pour into the two jet-black spheres.

He continued onward.

Not far ahead, another sweeping energy storm loomed across a vast area.

Yang Kai frowned and, unwillingly, began to circulate Saint Yuan, preparing to force his way through the danger ahead.

Since he entered the starry sky this had become commonplace; unlike when he first ascended to the Transcendent Realm and nearly died battling starry storms, with his current cultivation and robust body he could now ignore such assaults.

When the storm struck, he guided the Star Shuttle through with casual ease, his expression calm.

Countless meteorites, large and small, swirled within the storm, intensifying its power.

One meteorite caught Yang Kai's eye; he slipped onto it, examined it carefully for a while, and his body convulsed with a surge of excitement.
