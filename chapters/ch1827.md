## Chapter 1827 — Actually Drove Him Off

Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai were both straightforward men of noble temperament; being so lightly dismissed and humiliated by Yang Kai, of course they could not swallow it.

Flower Plucking Finger was a supreme secret art that Lin Yuhao had studied for many years. Its power was immense — it killed without shedding blood and perfectly suited his style.

A spiritual-flower flashed across his fingertip, and the formless energy was already sweeping toward Yang Kai.

Yi Zhengkai stood to one side and had no intention of teaming up with Lin Yuhao; instead he stared intently at Yang Kai’s movements. He had a premonition the ultimate skill would be useless against Yang Kai, because this youth’s strength seemed very great.

Even if it were useless, one could still read a man’s depth by his reaction, so Yi Zhengkai watched very carefully.

But in the next moment his expression froze completely as he murmured, “How is that possible?”

Yang Kai did not even move his body; he merely exhaled gently forward, and Lin Yuhao’s Flower Plucking Finger was broken outright — petals scattered in midair, lacking even the power to touch Yang Kai’s body.

Lin Yuhao was stunned too; he exchanged a glance with Yi Zhengkai and felt his heart sink halfway.

That the other had so casually undone his strongest secret art showed his cultivation had reached a level the two could not fathom; if their strengths differed so greatly, such a thing would be impossible.

“Not a bad secret art,” Yang Kai chuckled lightly. “A pity your cultivation is too low to draw out its full effect.”

The remark sounded like an insult, but Lin Yuhao only showed a contemplative expression and was not in the least displeased.

In martial cultivation, attainment came first. Although Yang Kai looked young, if his strength was deep then he was entitled to speak his mind.

After speaking, Yang Kai’s face turned grave. “You two hide here, brewing tea and discoursing, ignoring the world as if carefree — but are you truly free and unbound?”

Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai looked at one another, both wearing awkward expressions.

Yang Kai sneered coldly, “If you truly possessed carefree natures that would be one thing. But I see you are not. If you wish to withdraw from the world, why meddle in its affairs? Needlessly courting trouble is laughable. Either you truly retire to the mountains and die quietly, never emerging, or you fall into the mortal world and taste the full breadth of life; on the path of the Martial Dao pursue clarity of thought and strive onward. Hesitating, anxious, looking before and after as you do, you will never achieve anything!”

“Pursue clarity of thought and strive onward!” Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai’s bodies trembled; thoughtful expressions flickered across their faces, their complexions changing as if struck by sudden insight — at times bewildered, at times invigorated.

Yang Kai glanced at them, laughed softly, then beckoned to the woman called Ling'er, “Miss, pour another cup, don’t be so stingy.”

Ling'er bared her teeth and glared at Yang Kai, clutching the teapot to her chest as if vowing to defend it to the death.

Yang Kai sheepishly pinched his nose.

At that moment Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai suddenly threw back their heads and gave a long howl, and that cry stirred the heavens: clouds rolled and thunder pealed above the Nine Heavens Sacred Land as heavy black clouds pressed down like a quilt.

“Oh? They are about to ascend?” Yang Kai looked at the sky in surprise — that was clearly the heavenly baptism that accompanied a cultivator’s major breakthrough.

He had not expected that those two upstarts would, because of his few words, break through their shackles. It seemed their talent was not ordinary; they had only been held back by the Spiritual Qi conditions on Tongxuan Continent.

The howls faded, and Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai looked solemn as they flew upward, separating to receive the Heaven-and-Earth Energy’s baptism.

“What did you do to the two young masters?” Ling'er’s face turned pale as she rushed to Yang Kai and demanded loudly.

The other girls swarmed up as well, hemming Yang Kai in, their beautiful eyes filled with worry and anger — worried for Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai, angry at Yang Kai.

It seemed that if anything befell Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai, they would gladly pummel Yang Kai to death with their fists.

“I didn’t do anything to them, didn’t you see?” Yang Kai raked his head. “I only said a few words to them…”

“Then why did they become like this?” Ling'er nearly broke down in tears from anxiety.

“Calm down, they’ll be down soon, and they’ll be stronger once they descend!” Yang Kai patiently explained.

“Who would believe you, you villain? Sisters, beat him first and ask questions later.” A round-faced girl in the crowd shouted angrily.

At her words, a dozen girls raised their fists and rained blows down on Yang Kai like pebbles.

“Huh, where did he go?” Ling'er suddenly shrieked; she found in astonishment that Yang Kai, who had been sitting in the chair, had vanished — the girls’ punches struck only empty air.

“That person…could he be a ghost?” The round-faced girl turned pale and asked cautiously.

At that question the dozen girls all went white, their bodies trembling; thinking they had been near a specter so long, all their hearts grew uneasy.

On one of the Nine Peaks’ main summits, Yang Kai sighed, “These little girls nowadays are out of control.”

Those girls were not strong in the Martial Dao, but their determination to protect Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai was fierce, and Yang Kai could not bear to stay and be beaten; he decisively fled.

In the sky two figures floated as Heaven-and-Earth power struck them, bringing forth earthshaking cries that nonetheless contained stubborn will and exhilarated joy.

Only after half a day did the phenomena above the Nine Heavens Sacred Land slowly subside.

In the pavilion Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai revealed themselves at the same time; they exchanged looks and laughed knowingly.

Though they appeared ragged, both had broken through the Saint Realm and advanced to the Saint King Realm.

“Are you both all right, young masters?” Ling'er and the dozen girls hurried over and asked.

“Never mind, ah, where is that friend?” Lin Yuhao turned to look around; seeing no sign of Yang Kai he was startled.

“That specter has already been driven off by us sisters,” Ling'er waved her fists boastingly.

“Specter…” Yi Zhengkai’s face twitched; though he still did not know exactly how strong Yang Kai was, a few words had enabled him and Lin Yuhao to ascend simultaneously — Yang Kai had already reached a height they needed to look up to. Even now that they had broken through the Saint Realm, he did not dare compare himself to Yang Kai.

Such a high master, yet spoken of by the girls as a specter…

“You actually drove him off?” Lin Yuhao looked annoyed.

“Young master, did we do something wrong?” Ling'er asked nervously.

“It’s all right, it’s all right!” Yi Zhengkai hurriedly waved his hand. “It’s not your fault, you…”

He stopped mid-sentence as he pricked up his ears; then his face brightened and he glanced at Lin Yuhao, who was also smiling. The two nodded in tacit understanding.

“You stay here, Brother Yi and I will be right back,” Lin Yuhao ordered. With that he launched off in a direction and Yi Zhengkai followed closely.

After a few dozen breaths they both arrived at the main peak where Yang Kai had been; upon seeing that deep and inscrutable figure they fell solemn and cupped their fists in salute, “Many thanks, elder, for guiding us out of our confusion; we were discourteous before, please forgive us.”

They did not know how old Yang Kai truly was, but since his strength surpassed theirs he might be a monster who had lived for centuries; to call him elder would not shame them.

“Elder?” Yang Kai rubbed his nose and laughed, “No need for that. I’m not that old. And it’s not really guidance; your breakthroughs were your own doing after all, nothing to do with me.”

If Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai had not shown signs of being willing to step out and do their part for the continent, Yang Kai would have been too lazy to bother with them.

He had meant to drive them off — this was his territory in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land and he intended to arrange a Great Space Array here; he would not tolerate strangers occupying it. But upon sensing their decent natures, another idea had occurred to him.

Lin Yuhao and Yi Zhengkai exchanged a look; the former asked, “Then, may I ask…how should we address this friend?”

“Yang Kai!”

“Yang Kai?” Yi Zhengkai frowned. “That name…seems familiar somehow.”

“Could it be that you…” Lin Yuhao’s expression turned serious as he stared at Yang Kai. “Could you be—”

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

“It truly is you?” Lin Yuhao was shocked.

“Brother Yi…” Yi Zhengkai looked at Lin Yuhao for help; he still could not place where he had heard Yang Kai’s name.

“Brother Yi, truly forgetful,” Lin Yuhao chuckled dryly. “We were just discussing imitating the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land — now the lord himself stands before us and Brother Yi does not recognize him?”

Yi Zhengkai blurted, “The lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land! So you are the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?”

The lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was a legendary figure across Tongxuan Continent, akin to the Great Demon God.

Many only knew the existence of the lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land but not his true name — just as with the Great Demon God: people knew of his presence through the years, yet few knew what the Great Demon God was actually called.

Yi Zhengkai still could not recall until Lin Yuhao’s reminder jolted him into astonishment.

In the next moment his face changed wildly, cold sweat beading on his forehead as he cupped his fists, “So it is Saint Lord Yang’s presence! Brother Lin and I were blind; we beg Saint Lord Yang to forgive our offense.”

Lin Yuhao also trembled beside him, fearful, “Since Saint Lord Yang has returned, Brother Yi and I will immediately leave the Nine Heavens Sacred Land; we beg Saint Lord Yang not to hold our intrusion against us.”
