## Chapter 1206 — Flowing Flame Fireblaze, Farewell

They say fortune and calamity are intertwined; Yang Kai felt that truth keenly in this moment.

He had not expected that within the Flowing Flame Sandland there would exist such a peculiar distorted space capable of allowing him to comprehend the mysteries of spatial power.

He even formed the temporary plan to remain here instead of leaving — to stand in place, continuously concentrate spatial energy, resonate with everything around him, and let those instants of clarity surge into his mind and carve into the depths of his soul.

Spatial power is notoriously difficult to cultivate, because so few understand it; there is no clear method of training, nor anyone to pass down insights.

When Yang Kai first began training spatial power, he relied on tearing open space and entering the chaotic currents within to sense the surging flows, using that to deepen his understanding of spatial force; however, that method only worked for a short while, and as Yang Kai’s comprehension deepened, walking through the spatial turbulence became effortless and thus no longer instructive.

Afterwards he resorted to absorbing the energy of Ethereal Crystals, a ruinous indulgence, but one he could not help but undertake.

Fortunately, the Stone Puppet had discovered a vein of Ethereal Crystals with abundant yield, enough for him to squander for a long time; once those Ethereal Crystals were exhausted, obtaining more would be far from easy.

People who lack long-term planning invite near-term worries; Ethereal Crystals are scarce everywhere because they can be used to craft Spatial Rings, and Spatial Rings are the Secret Treasure every martial artist must possess for storage.

Now that there existed a place here ideal for cultivating spatial power, Yang Kai naturally wanted to seize it.

Moreover, training here seemed far more effective than merely absorbing Ethereal Crystals; the gains were greater!

Realizing this, Yang Kai immediately resolved to stay for the time being; the Flowing Flame Sandland would close in about four months, a span long enough for him to find a suitable place to refine the Profound Yin Moon Water, so there was no need to hurry.

It took a full incense stick’s time before Yang Kai slowly sat down; moving within this strange space, even though he was versed in the subtleties of spatial power, his motions were as slow as a turtle’s crawl — an outsider witnessing it would surely find it odd and think him performing some trick, for this space’s strangeness could not be perceived by Divine Sense; only by delving in and experiencing it personally would one discern anything.

After sitting, Yang Kai calmed the surging Qi and blood in his chest; his eyes glittered with radiant intent. He extended a hand and gently waved it forward.

A single waving motion consumed enormous effort and much time, yet with that sweep a hair-thin black fissure of space suddenly appeared, only to vanish in an instant like a fleeting blossom.

Seeing this, Yang Kai was not startled but delighted, grinning broadly.

Since he had decided to use this rare environment to cultivate spatial power, of course he would employ the Space Blade to train.

In the stone chamber on Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai had comprehended a way to materialize spatial force into an overt attack — the Space Blade — but back then, no matter how he trained, the Space Blade’s power was slight; it could not be used truly in combat. It was unnecessary against weak foes and proved a mere trifle when facing powerful opponents.

Thus he longed to refine this unique divine ability of his, but had lacked suitable conditions and environment.

Here, however, was absolutely the best training ground; Yang Kai could foresee that if he could forge the Space Blade in a place like this, then upon leaving the area the Space Blade would be able to exert real power.

From his earlier trial he had calculated that this space was solid and viscous, making tearing it apart difficult; cultivating the Space Blade here would not only deepen his comprehension of spatial mysteries but would also rapidly perfect this attack technique.

Calm and unhurried, Yang Kai tore through the space again and again, wielding his Space Blade.

Each hair‑thin spatial fissure, the moment it manifested, would instantly vanish under the tremendous pressure of this place.

Yang Kai trained for a full day, exhausting his vast Divine Sense power to nothing, yet made no progress.

He was not anxious, however, because he already sensed that his command of spatial power had become considerably more adept than before; his methods for tearing space had multiplied, and he believed that continued training would surely yield a breakthrough.

With his Divine Sense drained, Yang Kai could not continue and had to take some Pills to replenish his Divine Sense and sit to recover.

Though the Warm Spirit Lotus was still evolving, its restorative and nourishing effects on his Divine Sense had not diminished; if anything, it seemed a touch stronger than before.

In only two hours Yang Kai had filled his once-parched Sea of Consciousness again.

He slowly opened his eyes and was about to unleash the Space Blade once more when suddenly a spark-like streak of light flew rapidly from a very distant position, racing along the narrow gorge like lightning toward him.

"Flowing Flame Fireblaze!" Yang Kai cried out.

He had seen a Flowing Flame Fireblaze once before in the first Heat‑Flame Zone, so on sight he recognized it immediately. The last time he’d glimpsed one, it had flashed through his Divine Sense and despite pursuing it he hadn’t caught up — a thoroughly frustrating affair.

This Flowing Flame Fireblaze was identical to the one he’d seen before: ludicrously fast, swifter even than the spread of Divine Sense; one moment he discerned its trace at the far end of the gorge, the next it was already before him.

Yang Kai instinctively wanted to dodge; he had no hope of capturing such a thing, for the Fireblaze’s abnormal speed was simply beyond his pursuit.

But as his body moved, he suddenly recalled that the space he occupied was extraordinary — solid and viscous — and he could not stir.

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened; he widened them and stared fixedly at the Flowing Flame Fireblaze rushing toward him, secretly hopeful.

"Shh..."

With a soft sound, as the spark charged into this odd space some ten zhang in length, just as Yang Kai had predicted, its speed instantly slowed by countless times!

Yang Kai rejoiced; he had suspected that this congealed space might impede a Flowing Flame Fireblaze, and seeing it verified he knew his conjecture was correct: while the viscous space could not hinder a Fire Spirit Beast’s movements, it could curb the Fireblaze’s abnormal velocity.

At least now Yang Kai could truly see what a Flowing Flame Fireblaze looked like.

It resembled a spark that had splintered off scorching embers, burning with a crimson light; tiny though it was, it held astonishing energy within.

After entering that strange space, the Flowing Flame Fireblaze was not fixed in place but moved forward at the steady pace of a walking human, slowly forcing its way out.

Yang Kai roughly calculated and quickly realized that if he did nothing and stayed where he was, he would certainly miss this rare Flowing Flame Fireblaze, because by its flight path it would pass about a foot from him.

How could Yang Kai tolerate that? He hastily used spatial power, painfully and slowly shifting his body toward the Fireblaze’s inevitable path.

Inch by inch he moved; he felt as if he were an aged corpse attempting to stir at the last wick of life, every inch costing him enormous strength and Divine Sense. In moments his body trembled violently and his flesh throbbed with pain.

And yet the Flowing Flame Fireblaze continued to drift toward him at a calm, unhurried pace.

Before long it arrived not far from Yang Kai.

He grew frantic, trembling as he stretched a hand to snatch it, but the spark drifted past roughly three cun from his fingertip.

Yang Kai’s nose twisted in furious indignation.

He felt certain that if the Flowing Flame Fireblaze possessed cognition, it had just been mocking his presumption.

Twisting his head with great effort, watching it glide past, Yang Kai’s face flushed with vexation.

He had failed again! Once it had flown past, he knew he could not seize it; sure enough, a moment later the Fireblaze burst out of the odd space’s confinement, regaining its prior abnormal speed and flashing from view in an instant.

So close — just a hair’s breadth away from acquiring the treasure that could mutate one’s Divine Sense!

It would be false to claim he felt no regret, but Yang Kai quickly adjusted his temperament, refusing to dwell on the Fireblaze and focusing instead on tempering his Space Blade.

Failing to capture the Flowing Flame Fireblaze was no great loss — what mattered most right now was cultivating his spatial power.

He released a Space Blade and was delighted to find its force had apparently increased; though still hair‑thin and fleeting, its duration was visibly longer than the day before.

Yang Kai’s spirits soared; the matter of the Flowing Flame Fireblaze was soon cast from his thoughts as he devoted himself to comprehending the mysteries of space.

Three days later Yang Kai watched a Space Blade half an inch wide streak out and vanish after flying less than a zhang, his face showing both satisfaction and exhilaration.

This damned place truly was the best ground for cultivating spatial mysteries — after only three short days here, he felt his grasp of spatial secrets had begun to coalesce. With his understanding deepened, the Space Blade he produced was now thousands of times more powerful than three days prior.

Both the size of the Space Blade and the time it could persist within this strange space, as well as the tearing distance, had made tremendous gains.

At his present rate of growth, if another month passed Yang Kai estimated his Space Blade could be used against foes; by then, even against Origin Returning Realm experts’ Shi, he might well have a fighting chance.
