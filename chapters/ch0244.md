## Chapter 244 — You Have Malicious Intentions Towards Me

“Continue speaking,” Yang Kai said, temporarily suppressing his desire to subdue a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast, as he looked at Leng Shan.

Leng Shan nodded. “There were more than thirty people, and nearly ten have died. Except for one who escaped due to his powerful strength, the rest have all been implanted with Control Soul Insects and are under the control of Zi Mo and the others.”

One escaped, and Yang Kai didn't need to ask further to know who it was; aside from Wu Chengyi, no one else could achieve that.

“Why didn’t they kill you?” Yang Kai asked suspiciously. Killing a martial artist yields blood beads that are far superior to those from Demonic Beasts, especially since all those people are experts in the True Essence Realm.

“They want to extract the secrets of our respective sects from us, so they haven’t killed us for now!” Leng Shan said with a bitter smile. “Each of us is an elite from our sects, and the martial skills and techniques we cultivate are naturally the best in our sects. The people from Tianlang Kingdom are here for that.”

Yang Kai turned to look at Zi Mo, who shrugged and said, “Don’t look at me; I haven’t done anything to those people. I only have control over Leng Shan and Jin Hao, and I didn’t even have the chance to interrogate them about their martial skills before you subdued me.”

Leng Shan continued, “After the people from Tianlang Kingdom achieved a great victory, Zi Mo’s Senior Brother Chi Xue took his Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast and left alone to chase after Wu Chengyi. Then for some unknown reason, those three had a huge argument, and Jin Hao and I were assigned to Zi Mo, leaving that group.”

As Leng Shan spoke, Zi Mo was beside her, biting her lip and sneering, her expression filled with disdain.

Yang Kai glanced at her and chuckled, “It seems you and your two companions aren’t getting along too well.”

“Is there no conflict within your sect?” Zi Mo shot Yang Kai a glare. “We came here for training with three tasks in total. The first is to obtain blood beads to enhance ourselves, the second is to extract the cultivation methods of your Great Han martial artists, and the third is to find the legendary Liuyan Liquid and Soul Cleansing Dew. Each task is related to our future, and if completed well, we will naturally gain more benefits upon returning to our sect.”

“Your two companions are teaming up to bully you, not wanting you to gain any benefits, right?” Yang Kai quickly pieced together the situation.

They captured so many people, yet only assigned two to Zi Mo. Even if Zi Mo could extract information from Leng Shan and Jin Hao, it would only yield the secrets of Ghost King Valley. In comparison, the resources controlled by Zi Mo’s two companions were far greater.

This was competition among sect members, something that existed in any sect.

“They come from the same family, so naturally, they will exclude me!” Zi Mo gritted her teeth, her heart filled with resentment.

Yang Kai’s eyes turned, “Do you want me to help you get revenge?”

The grievances among the disciples of Senluo Palace from Tianlang Kingdom could definitely be used as leverage.

Everyone was in a foreign land, and they would eventually cross paths. If Yang Kai wanted to live comfortably, he had to take the initiative and eliminate those two martial artists from Senluo Palace. Moreover, they had a Senior Brother controlling a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast, a person as formidable as Wu Chengyi, making it essential to eliminate all unstable factors before encountering him.

Zi Mo’s eyes flickered as she looked at Yang Kai, frowning, “Although my life and death are in your hands, I am still a member of Tianlang and a martial artist of Senluo Palace! I won’t do anything to betray my sect. Even if you kill me, I won’t help you deal with them!”

Yang Kai couldn’t help but look at her in surprise, never expecting this woman to have such principles.

Not wanting to pressure her, Yang Kai smiled, “I was just asking; if you don’t want to, then forget it.”

Zi Mo was taken aback; she had prepared herself for punishment after rejecting Yang Kai’s proposal, yet he let it go so easily.

“Are you really this easy to talk to?” Zi Mo wondered what Yang Kai was up to, feeling a bit suspicious.

“What do you think?” Yang Kai scoffed lightly.

Zi Mo blinked her big eyes and smiled charmingly, “If you’re really this easy to talk to, then why not lift the restrictions in my mind?”

“Daydreaming!”

In the following days, Yang Kai trained alongside Leng Shan and Zi Mo in this foreign land.

They rarely encountered enemies, only occasionally coming across a Demonic Beast or two.

If it was a Fourth-Tier, they would kill it on the spot and collect the blood bead. If it was a Fifth-Tier, Zi Mo would control it and implant a Control Soul Insect. However, after several days, they had only encountered one Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast.

Yang Kai didn’t keep the blood beads for himself; he distributed them to Zi Mo and Leng Shan. He didn’t lack the energy from these few blood beads; what he wanted most was to continuously refine the Primordial Qi in his meridians and Dantian, so he could progress towards the True Essence Realm.

Currently, their training mainly focused on searching for the legendary Soul Cleansing Dew, which Zi Mo’s Senior Brother Chi Xue was also seeking.

Neither Zi Mo nor Leng Shan knew much about Soul Cleansing Dew, so they naturally didn’t know where to look for it.

However, Yang Kai found it quite strange that over these days, Zi Mo had been constantly teasing him with her actions and words, even more so than when they first met. Even Leng Shan, the cold woman, would “unintentionally” reveal her charming demeanor and subtle allure.

Occasionally, Yang Kai would catch a glimpse of sympathy and delight in their eyes.

What’s going on? Yang Kai was utterly perplexed.

After walking for half a day, the three found a place to sit and rest. Dozens of Demonic Beasts followed closely, while the rest had been sent out to scout the area.

Yang Kai was meditating to recover his strength, observing with a calm demeanor, when suddenly two fragrant breezes approached, and Zi Mo and Leng Shan sat down beside him, one on each side.

They pressed closely against him, as if it were extremely cold here.

Yang Kai frowned and looked at them.

Leng Shan felt embarrassed under his gaze, her cheeks turning red, while Zi Mo forced a smile and asked, “What’s wrong?”

“You two have been acting strangely these past few days. Are you secretly discussing something?” Yang Kai asked with a stern face.

Zi Mo protested, “How could that be? We’ve been right beside you the whole time. Even if we wanted to discuss something, we wouldn’t have the chance!”

Yang Kai thought about it; they indeed didn’t have time for any underhanded schemes, but why did he still feel something was off?

“Why do you think we’re strange?” Zi Mo smiled sweetly, leaning closer to Yang Kai, half of her body nestled against him, her firm and ample bosom pressing against his arm, completely reshaping his perception.

Feeling that astonishing elasticity, Yang Kai lowered his head and saw a breathtaking expanse of white.

Zi Mo secretly laughed in her heart, maintaining a calm facade, slightly leaning forward to reveal even more.

“It just feels…” Yang Kai stared for a moment, licking his lips, his expression brazen.

“Feelings are inaccurate,” Zi Mo laughed delicately, her body swaying like a flower, her chest undulating.

Just as Yang Kai’s throat felt parched, Leng Shan unexpectedly pressed her soft bosom against him as well. Yang Kai’s body trembled, feeling as if his abdomen were on fire.

The sensations from both sides overwhelmed him, leaving him dazed.

With a sudden determination, he pushed Zi Mo down and mounted her.

“Ah…” Zi Mo exclaimed in surprise, but showed no fear, her beautiful eyes shimmering with desire, smiling as she gazed at Yang Kai.

This little brat can’t even fulfill his desires, what else does he want? Hmph!

Leng Shan beside them was stunned, staring wide-eyed.

“This is your own doing. I’ve seen through you these days; you have malicious intentions towards me, don’t you?” Yang Kai’s expression turned fierce as he placed his hands on Zi Mo’s ample chest, kneading it.

“W-What… what malicious intentions do I have towards you?” Zi Mo bit her red lip, her brows furrowed in pain, but deep down, she couldn’t help but feel a thrill from being ravaged, wishing Yang Kai would be even rougher.

This thought surged within her, causing her to feel a wave of shame.

“Do you really think I’m blind?” Yang Kai sneered, roughly lifting Zi Mo’s clothing, exposing her exquisite upper body to his gaze, his large hand covering and kneading without a hint of tenderness.

Zi Mo’s body stiffened, and she couldn’t help but let out a soft moan. Leng Shan, standing nearby, was dumbfounded, her ears catching that enchanting sound, stirring a strange feeling within her.

As Yang Kai continued to knead, Zi Mo even began to wriggle in response, her soft moans filling the air, leaving Leng Shan weak and collapsing to the ground, her legs instinctively clenching together.

Though it felt exhilarating, Zi Mo hadn’t lost her senses. She and Leng Shan had only been teasing Yang Kai, wanting to see him make a fool of himself.

Now, seeing him become so aggressive was a bit too much for Zi Mo to handle.

Isn’t he… why is he so enthusiastic? Zi Mo panted, secretly bending her knees, pressing against Yang Kai’s lower body.

Moments later, Zi Mo felt something hard as iron and hot as fire.

In shock, Zi Mo gasped, her body instantly stiffening, her beautiful face turning pale.

“Hehe!” Yang Kai looked up at her with a wicked grin, reaching out a hand to explore beneath Zi Mo’s skirt.

“Don’t… stop!” Zi Mo panicked, quickly grabbing Yang Kai’s arm.

“You say stop and I stop?” Yang Kai sneered, his movements unceasing.

His hand delved deeper, finding warmth and wetness, a muddy mess.

As Zi Mo struggled, she quickly lost the strength to resist, collapsing softly.

Leng Shan also lost her ability to think, utterly bewildered by how Zi Mo could act so convincingly. Even if she wanted to see him make a fool of himself, she didn’t expect it to come at such a cost. This… this… was already too much to accept.

Leng Shan’s face flushed, her heart racing, blood boiling, a warm current flowing through her lower abdomen, feeling shy, embarrassed, and stirred with various emotions.

Just when Zi Mo thought she had bitten off more than she could chew, she suddenly opened her eyes wide, not knowing where the strength came from, and pushed Yang Kai away, her expression changing drastically. “Wait, my Demonic Beast is dead; there may be enemies nearby!”
