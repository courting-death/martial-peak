## Chapter 1361 — Safe and Sound

It seemed she sensed Yang Kai's arrival; Yang Yan slowly opened her beautiful eyes and, through that transparent membrane of energy, glanced at him.

Their eyes met, and Yang Kai's face changed in alarm.

Because in that instant he was horrified to find Yang Yan's gaze somewhat unfamiliar, and it involuntarily instilled in him a humbling mindset, as if in her presence he were as insignificant as an ant.

But when he looked more closely, Yang Yan's expression returned to normal, as if what he'd just seen had been nothing more than an illusion.

After glancing at him, Yang Yan closed her lovely eyes again, appearing utterly distracted and flawless; Yang Kai tried calling to her several times but received no response.

Just then, the Sea of Consciousness below began to churn, and an orange bubble suddenly rose from within; the bubble ascended slowly to Yang Yan's side and popped with a soft puff, and with its burst a trace of energy almost imperceptible to Yang Kai flowed into Yang Yan's Spirit Body.

The next moment Yang Yan's face contorted with extreme pain, as if enduring some trial; her dark brows knitted tightly, her delicate body trembled continuously, and she hugged herself more tightly with both arms.

Yang Kai's heart tightened; his expression shifted like the weather.

He didn't understand what was happening to Yang Yan, but by now he could at least see that her condition had something to do with the bubbles in her Sea of Consciousness.

Weren't those bubbles supposed to contain Yang Yan's life experiences and memories? How could they be making her suffer like this?

Suddenly Yang Kai remembered something: Yang Yan had once told him that no one had taught her the knowledge of forging or formations; she had inexplicably comprehended them herself, and as she delved into arrays and forging, what she understood grew deeper and deeper.

Could it be that those bubbles sealed away knowledge Yang Yan had not yet mastered? But where did those things come from, why were they stored in her Sea of Consciousness, and why did they force her to comprehend them at this critical moment?

Yang Kai couldn't fathom it.

Yang Yan's present condition was like a person receiving an overwhelming influx of unknown information that could not be immediately digested; she could only passively accept it and then enclose her Spirit Body within the Sea of Consciousness in search of self-protection.

Although these were only Yang Kai's conjectures, they were probably not far from the truth.

If that were the case, Yang Kai couldn't help; unless he seized the knowledge sealed in those bubbles to shoulder some of the burden for Yang Yan. But that was her treasure; without her permission Yang Kai couldn't do such a thing.

To do so would be outright robbery.

Now Yang Yan was suffering somewhat, but once she endured this period, the gains she would reap would be unimaginable.

Having realized that, Yang Kai let out a quiet breath; now that he'd found the root of the problem and it wasn't what he'd feared, he no longer worried.

However, he wasn’t in a hurry to leave for the time being. Staying here would allow him to keep watch over Yang Yan, so that if any accident truly occurred, he could rescue her in time.

After deciding, Yang Kai spoke softly to Yang Yan a few words to tell her his plan, then with a flicker of movement slipped away to a distance, seated cross-legged in midair, and watched the situation on Yang Yan's side.

Perhaps it was only his imagination, but it seemed his presence encouraged Yang Yan, and in the time that followed the bubbles in the Sea of Consciousness rose one after another, constantly drifting to Yang Yan's side and bursting, pouring the sealed information into her body.

Though Yang Yan still looked pained, her reactions were much better than before.

As time passed and the bubbles diminished, Yang Yan's expression gradually steadied.

In the blink of an eye it was about half a month; during that time Yang Kai did not leave, not even closing his eyes, constantly watching Yang Yan's side.

Finally the last bubble in the Sea of Consciousness rose and burst; the sealed information inside was quickly absorbed by Yang Yan. At that moment the energy membrane surrounding her body shattered with a roar. Yang Yan, still with eyes closed, slowly stretched her delicate form; one hand clasped over her chest, the other shielding between her graceful thighs, her body leaning back slightly, long hair flowing as if without wind, extravagantly splayed out.

At that instant the entire Sea of Consciousness fell suddenly quiet.

Yang Kai stared blankly; the beautiful scene made him feel Yang Yan was like a goddess, majestic and untouchable.

All this time Yang Yan had wrapped her head and face in a black robe; even Yang Kai had found it difficult to see her true looks, yet he hadn't expected this woman to be so alluring—if she dressed better and walked out, countless men would surely go mad.

As Yang Kai stood in stunned observation, Yang Yan's Spirit Body suddenly emitted a ring of dazzling light; the brilliance was blinding, and with it a presence drifted out that made Yang Kai's face change dramatically.

That aura assaulted him, making him unable to keep from trembling.

Imperial Might! Yang Kai's eyes widened. He had sensed this aura on the Fallen Emperor Mountains, so he could not mistake it.

The Imperial Might appeared strangely and vanished quickly; after the light faded Yang Kai saw a set of black robes materialize on Yang Yan's Spirit Body, covering her head and face. Her lovely eyes glanced toward Yang Kai with a slightly embarrassed look.

Seeing that, Yang Kai frowned slightly, rose, and swiftly flew to her side. Once close he sized her up, his face showing an odd expression.

Yang Yan was still the same Yang Yan, seemingly unchanged, but what he'd witnessed earlier filled Yang Kai with doubts.

"Are you all right now?" Yang Kai asked after a long silence.

"Mm, I'm fine." Yang Yan brushed the hair at her ear and smiled faintly at Yang Kai.

That smile was filled with confidence! It was a smile Yang Kai had never seen before; the Yang Yan he knew was timid as a mouse, only showing such confidence when working on forging or formations.

“This time, I made you worry,” Yang Yan said softly, gratitude showing on her face.

“It’s good that you’re all right. Wu Yi and Qian Yue have been worried sick, not knowing what had happened to you. Since everything’s fine now, let’s head out.”

"You go out first. I need to stay a while longer to sort some things out," Yang Yan bit her red lip.

Yang Kai looked at her and nodded: "All right, come out when you've sorted it."

After saying that Yang Kai flickered and disappeared from inside Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness.

After Yang Kai left, a trace of complexity appeared on Yang Yan’s face. No one knew what she was thinking—her beautiful eyes were filled with confusion. After a long while, she let out a soft sigh, sat cross-legged, and closed her eyes to quietly sense the flood of information that had newly appeared within her mind.

In the loft Yang Kai opened his eyes and glanced at Yang Yan sitting cross-legged before him; he found her complexion much rosier and her breathing steady, and immediately realized she was indeed out of danger, only that her Spirit Body remained immersed in the Sea of Consciousness and unwilling to fully awaken for now.

No matter what Yang Yan had experienced or what she had gained, Yang Kai couldn’t be bothered to ask. To him, as long as she was still Yang Yan, that was enough. If she ever wished to tell him, she certainly wouldn’t hide it.

He carefully laid her down on the bed, tucking the covers in, then stepped outside.

Outside the door, Wu Yi and Qian Yue still waited anxiously; Yang Kai had been gone for half a month, with no news, so of course they were extremely worried.

They didn't dare disturb her lightly, and their hearts were burning with anxiety.

Hearing the door open, the two girls were overjoyed. Seeing Yang Kai, Wu Yi hurriedly asked, "How is she?"

"She's fine, don't worry. She should wake in a few days."

At Yang Kai's words both Wu Yi and Qian Yue brightened, patted their chests, and let out a big breath.

"Putting Yang Yan aside for now, with the Imperial Garden's emergence, has Dragon Lair Mountain been affected?"

"You already know it's the Imperial Garden?" Wu Yi showed surprise; after all the Imperial Garden had only just appeared, and Yang Kai had been by Yang Yan's side, so he couldn't possibly have gotten the news so quickly.

Wu Yi knew of the Imperial Garden because news had come from Yingyue Hall.

Quickly she collected her thoughts and replied: "There are more unfamiliar faces nearby, and the number of warriors in Tianyun City has exploded, but so far it hasn't had much impact on Dragon Lair Mountain. If it continues like this, though, I can't say."

Yang Kai nodded slightly; what Wu Yi said was exactly what he had worried about.

By coincidence, the Imperial Garden had emerged and was now floating right above Dragon Lair Mountain. In just a dozen days, it had already drawn numerous outside cultivators to observe and gather information. As more time passed, surely even more experts would arrive. By then, with all sorts of people mixed together, who could say what might happen?

"Elder Qian sent you a message a few days ago — do you want to see it?" Wu Yi suddenly remembered.

"Oh? Where is it?" Yang Kai looked at her.

Wu Yi immediately took a letter-like object from her Spatial Ring and handed it over. Yang Kai opened it but found no characters written; unsurprised, he released Divine Sense to encompass it and within moments had investigated the information contained within.

The message from Qian Tong was simple—just two points. First, the internal strife within Yingyue Hall had already been quelled. That was hardly surprising; the fact that the opposing faction had waited until Qian Tong had been missing for half a year before making their move clearly showed they feared him. Now that Qian Tong had returned safely—and had even brought back an artificer with the potential to break through to the Origin Grade level—he naturally regained the upper hand and swiftly crushed the unrest before it could surface.

Moreover, with the Imperial Garden's sudden appearance, those at Yingyue Hall no longer wished to continue fighting; when the Hall Master spoke the dispute was over. Some were dealt with as a warning to others.

With internal strife ended, Qian Tong had a final meaningful message for Yang Kai: Yingyue Hall would no longer interfere in the enmity between Dragon Lair Mountain and the Xie Family, and trade between Dragon Lair Mountain and Yingyue Hall had been restored, with materials prices proactively reduced by ten percent.
