## Chapter 290 — Cultivating Soul Techniques

Yang Kai's expression changed slightly. Fortunately, he was mentally prepared this time. Although his soul was still in pain, it was not as helpless as before.

With his soul tightly closed, he maintained clarity in his spiritual plane. The Warm Spirit Lotus also played its role at the right moment, spreading a faint coolness in his mind, significantly reducing the pain.
	
Suspended in mid-air, Yang Kai took a few deep breaths. Once he adapted to the intensity of the attack, he continued to dive deeper.

After descending about a hundred zhang, he felt the surrounding Malevolent Aura's attack seemed to intensify. The unbearable pain returned, causing Yang Kai to halt.

In this manner, he intermittently descended for about a thousand zhang, yet he still did not reach the bottom of the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Furrowing his brows, Yang Kai felt he was on the verge of not being able to endure any longer.

The damage to his soul here was far more intense than when he was in that white mist in another place.

In that white mist, it only attacked the soul, but here, the Malevolent Aura not only attacked the soul but also various evils delved into his mind, drawing out the evil factors hidden deep within Yang Kai's consciousness.

This place was undoubtedly a treasure land for tempering the soul and cultivating Divine Sense! After descending a mere thousand zhang, Yang Kai could clearly feel his Divine Sense power had grown somewhat.

If he could cultivate here for an extended period, forming a Sea of Consciousness would likely not be a problem.

However, Yang Kai could not endure for too long. If he stayed too long, his temperament would likely be influenced and assimilated by the surrounding aura.

After a long silence, Yang Kai suddenly asked Di Mo, "Do you know any soul techniques? Preferably defensive ones."

"I do!" Di Mo replied readily.

"Then why didn't you say so earlier?" Yang Kai said, feeling frustrated.

"The things I possess, whether martial skills or soul techniques, are all extremely evil. Young Master, you have always looked down upon them," Di Mo felt somewhat wronged.

"Is this soul technique also evil?" Yang Kai inquired.

"It can be considered so, but if you cultivate it here, there is no need for those cruel methods. The evil aura here is the best place to cultivate that soul technique," Di Mo explained.

"Then stop talking nonsense and quickly teach me that soul technique!" Yang Kai urged.

"Oh..."

Di Mo's memory was quite chaotic. Although he had been brought out of the Inheritance Celestial Cave by Yang Kai for over two years, he had always been this way. After responding to Yang Kai, he pondered for a long time before recalling the soul technique and imparting it to Yang Kai.

The Soul Palace!

According to Di Mo, to cultivate this soul technique, one must find some living people to torment, making them suffer worse than death. Only after experiencing fear, terror, and despair can the soul power generated after their death be used for cultivation of The Soul Palace.

The cultivator collects the souls of the deceased, constructing a labyrinthine existence in their mind.

The tortured resentful souls become the bricks and tiles for building this labyrinth. The more evil the resentful souls, the greater the power of the labyrinth.

Once The Soul Palace is successfully cultivated, layers of winding passages will appear around the cultivator's Sea of Consciousness. The greatest use of this martial skill is defense.

Yet it is also a soul technique that combines offense and defense.

If an enemy dares to use Divine Sense to attack the cultivator, once the Divine Sense falls into this labyrinth, it will never find a way out, gradually being drained of power by the resentful souls hidden within the labyrinth.

The Soul Palace does not have a major completion realm. Because the cultivator can continuously add bricks and tiles to this Soul Palace surrounding the Sea of Consciousness, reinforcing and expanding it.

It protects the cultivator's Sea of Consciousness from external disturbances, serving as a defense as solid as gold.

The thick, almost tangible evil aura here is undoubtedly the most suitable material for cultivating The Soul Palace.

Such a soul technique greatly appealed to Yang Kai, filling him with joy, and he immediately began to cultivate.

However, before that, Yang Kai needed to familiarize himself with how to use his Divine Sense to capture the Malevolent Aura wandering outside his body, using it as the foundation for constructing the labyrinth.

This was relatively simple. Yang Kai had already cultivated his Divine Sense; he just needed to try using it.

For several consecutive days, Yang Kai focused on familiarizing himself with the wonders of Divine Sense. Streams of dark evil energy were drawn into his mind, transforming into bricks and tiles according to Yang Kai's own ideas and concepts, gradually constructing a sanctuary for his Divine Sense.

Building a Soul Palace in the mind is just like raising a tall building from the ground, especially a labyrinthine Soul Palace.

Once he became familiar with it, his movements became increasingly proficient and swift.

For an entire month, Yang Kai cultivated The Soul Palace a thousand zhang beneath the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Streams of evil energy were captured by his Divine Sense, disappearing into his mind. The labyrinth gradually took shape and expanded intricately.

After a month of cultivation, Yang Kai clearly felt his Divine Sense power had significantly increased. Now, when his Divine Sense spread out, it could probe the movements within a radius of twenty li.

The growth of Divine Sense power was inherently arduous. Even for experts in the Divine Roaming Realm, achieving mastery in Divine Sense was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.

It was far more challenging than cultivating the physical body.

The most common methods were to cultivate soul techniques or consume heaven-and-earth treasures that enhance Divine Sense power.

Yang Kai cultivated The Soul Palace in the harsh environment a thousand zhang beneath the Dragon Confinement Ravine, aided by the Warm Spirit Lotus. It was only natural that his Divine Sense power would grow stronger.

Another ten days passed, and The Soul Palace finally reached minor completion.

Although he still had not cultivated a Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai could clearly sense that around his mind, there was a layer of First Stage protection, tightly guarding the most critical position.

This layer of First Stage protection was entirely constructed from the evil energy spilling out from the depths of the Dragon Confinement Ravine.

Yet it could not affect Yang Kai in the slightest.

Because this was the soul technique Yang Kai had cultivated, all the evil energy had been marked with his aura imprint.

With The Soul Palace initially completed, Yang Kai naturally could not wait to test it.

He was situated a thousand zhang beneath the Dragon Confinement Ravine, where the Malevolent Aura could no longer affect him.

Leaping down, his speed increased.

At two thousand zhang, The Soul Palace remained as solid as gold; at three thousand zhang, The Soul Palace still stood unwavering.

He fell all the way to the deepest part of the Dragon Confinement Ravine, yet Yang Kai did not perceive any influence from the Malevolent Aura on himself. After some contemplation, he suddenly realized.

This was not due to the effectiveness of The Soul Palace's defense, but because his soul technique was inherently forged from the evil aura of this place.

The two were of the same origin; how could the external evil aura affect his Divine Sense?

"This soul technique is quite good," Yang Kai grinned.

He could clearly sense how terrifyingly dense the evil energy at the bottom of the Dragon Confinement Ravine was. Without the protection of The Soul Palace, his Divine Sense would likely be instantly obliterated.

"The source of the evil aura should be over here," Di Mo's voice came.

"This is also the source of Yang energy!" Yang Kai's expression brightened. The Yang Source Seal on his chest throbbed incessantly, a vigorous movement.

There must be some Yang attribute treasures ahead, and they must be very precious!

Hastily, he walked in that direction, his steps light.

The Dragon Confinement Ravine was long, stretching endlessly.

As he walked along, he saw many white bones. Stepping on these bones produced crackling sounds, which were chilling to the bone.

These were likely the disciples of the Lingxiao Pavilion who had died after being trapped in the Dragon Confinement Ravine over the years.

On both sides of the cliff, there were also some not very tall trees, bearing some dark fruits.

In such a place, there were even plants growing. Yang Kai casually picked one of the fruits to examine. He found it covered in evil energy, and the moment he touched it, a chilling sensation surged through him, evoking an instinctive fear.

"Evil Spirit Fruit... Tsk tsk, there are actually such things here," Di Mo exclaimed in surprise, feeling quite amazed. "No wonder your Sect Leader's second disciple could survive here."

"I was also wondering what he had been eating for ten years," Yang Kai smiled slightly, reaching out to pick all the remaining fruits and tossing them into the black book space.

The Sect Leader's second disciple had not picked all the fruits clean. It was unclear what his mindset was—perhaps he left them as a memento after being nourished by these fruits for ten years.

However, there were only two or three fruits left, which were not good items, merely containing a large amount of evil energy.

Continuing forward, before long, amidst the overwhelming evil aura, a figure suddenly appeared before Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's pupils involuntarily constricted, and he abruptly halted, cautiously observing the figure while secretly channeling his True Yuan.

In this place, he did not dare to use his Divine Sense. Once his Divine Sense left the protection of The Soul Palace, it would instantly turn to ashes, so he could not discern the identity of the figure ahead.

Yet the figure gave Yang Kai a strange feeling.

There was no trace of life aura; he sat cross-legged, surrounded by a dozen streams of black aura swirling like dragons. The black aura obscured his features.

"Dead!" Di Mo said in a low voice.

Yang Kai nodded silently and slowly approached.

As he got closer, Yang Kai caught sight of a chain-like object around the person's neck, connecting to a collar on his neck. The other end trailed in front of his chest, not long, only about a foot.

Yang Kai couldn't help but be moved.

He discovered that both the chain and the collar were crafted from Yang attribute treasures, emanating an aura of utmost Yang energy, far surpassing the True Yang Yuan Qi within him.

Vaguely, Yang Kai felt a sense of closeness between his True Yuan and this collar.

After a moment's thought, he understood that during his time cultivating in the Dragon Confinement Ravine, the Yang energy he absorbed was also emitted from this collar, so it was not surprising to feel this way.

The person's clothing had long turned to dust, and his flesh was nearly withered, yet within that seemingly frail body lay a terrifying explosive power. All the evil aura in the Dragon Confinement Ravine emanated from this person.

On his chest, there was a massive wound, hideous and terrifying.
