## Chapter 2311 — Honored Mother-in-law

After a short while, Yang Kai finally arrived before the bride and reached out to grab her red bridal veil.

Luo Jin’s expression shifted slightly, but he still held himself back and did not make a move, his intentions unclear.

All the guests around widened their eyes at this moment, staring intently at the bride, waiting for the thrilling moment.

With a swish, the red veil flew up, revealing a stunningly beautiful, slightly charming face that set many guests' hearts alight with envy.

As soon as her eyes were revealed, the bride looked toward Yang Kai, filled with excitement and a hint of reproach, as if blaming him for taking so long to lift her veil.

Yang Kai let out a long breath, a weight lifted from his heart, and grinned at the bride. “Senior, it really is you!”

“Fifth Sister!” Chai Hu also called out softly from the side.

The bride rolled her eyes toward Chai Hu, her expression full of gratitude. Though she was not in control of herself today, she had seen everything Chai Hu had done. Being manipulated by that middle-aged man and forced to act against Chai Hu in secret, she felt deeply guilty, wishing she could take his place.

“Senior, you can’t speak?” Yang Kai grinned and asked the bride with a smile.

The bride glared fiercely at Yang Kai, as if to say he was asking the obvious.

Yang Kai scratched his head awkwardly. “So you can’t move either?”

The bride blinked her eyes.

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, many guests showed puzzled expressions. They could sense that Yang Kai was at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, while the bride was only at the First Stage, yet Yang Kai addressed her as ‘Senior’.

What was going on?

Chai Hu also looked at Yang Kai in confusion and said, “Young Brother, do you know my Fifth Sister?” Although he had suspected before, seeing Yang Kai and his Fifth Sister act so familiar was still surprising. As far as he knew, his Fifth Sister and Eldest Brother had no acquaintances in the Star Realm.

Yang Kai smiled strangely and said, “Of course I know her! Senior Chi Yue... is my honored mother-in-law!”

As soon as these words were spoken, everyone was shocked.

Countless guests gaped at Yang Kai in disbelief, as if they had misheard. Many people glanced at Chi Yue, then at Luo Jin, their expressions constantly changing.

Yang Kai called the bride his honored mother-in-law. Didn’t that mean this bride-to-be already had children? And the renowned City Lord of Tianhe City was completely unaware, even wanting to take her as a concubine?

Once they understood the implication, many cultivators who already held grievances against the City Lord’s Mansion couldn’t help but feel a secret, malicious delight. Watching Luo Jin’s face darken with fury, it was as if they were witnessing the ultimate humiliation being played out before their eyes.

After saying that, Yang Kai’s surging emotions finally calmed down. The bride before him was indeed the Yao King Chi Yue, who had broken through the Dark Star’s seal and come to the Star Realm with Yang Kai, and was also Shan Qingluo’s adoptive mother.

When he first saw the bride, he hadn’t paid much attention, just feeling something was off. But when she used her power to attack Chai Hu, he recognized the familiar fluctuation of her Yao essence and secretly guessed her identity.

Thinking carefully, he realized she might be Chi Yue, which was why he insisted on seeing her face. He deliberately mentioned the Lingxiao Sect to test her reaction, and her response confirmed his suspicion. It was only because Luo Jin intervened that some trouble arose.

Now, seeing Chi Yue’s true face, Yang Kai finally relaxed, feeling a surge of excitement deep inside.

Back in the Starlight Passage, he and five other Third Stage Void King Realm experts had been separated by an accident, and even Liu Yan and Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao had gone missing.

After so long, he had only found Liu Yan by chance and brought her back to his side, but he still had no idea where Xiaoxiao and the others were.

Yang Kai had always worried about them, not knowing how they would survive in the unfamiliar Star Realm. But the Star Realm was vast, and with no connections or backing, he was powerless to search for them.

Meeting Chi Yue in Tianhe City this time was nothing short of a miracle.

If he hadn’t agreed to Ye Qinghan’s request to visit the Thousand Leaves Sect, he would never have appeared in Tianhe City. If Ye Qinghan hadn’t received a message from Ye Hen midway, asking her to attend this concubine ceremony, he would have missed Chi Yue entirely.

So many coincidences had to align for this fateful reunion—truly, life is unpredictable, while the will of Heaven remains ever constant. For a moment, Yang Kai could not help but sigh with emotion.

“Brat, what nonsense are you spouting?” Luo Jin finally couldn’t bear the humiliation and, after a moment of silence, roared furiously.

Chai Hu was also shocked, staring at Chi Yue in astonishment and swallowing hard. “Fifth Sister... she has children?”

Chi Yue stood quietly, unable to move, but her cheeks flushed red as she glared angrily at Yang Kai, as if blaming him for speaking carelessly and ruining her reputation.

Yang Kai laughed awkwardly. “Brother Chai, you misunderstand. Senior Chi Yue has an adopted daughter, an adopted daughter!”

Chai Hu laughed freely at this. “Whether adopted or biological, you’re family to us now!”

Yang Kai said, “Brother Chai, I saw all that you did. Let me thank you on behalf of my honored mother-in-law for your help!” With that, he cupped his fists and bowed deeply.

Chai Hu waved his hand. “Fifth Sister was in trouble, it was only right for me to help. Young Brother, you’d better see how to remove the restriction on her first!”

Yang Kai nodded, glanced at Chi Yue, and said solemnly, “Senior, forgive me!”

As he spoke, he grabbed Chi Yue’s fair wrist, letting his Origin Qi surge into her meridians.

Chi Yue’s delicate body trembled slightly, looking at Yang Kai in surprise. Earlier, with the red veil covering her, she couldn’t see what was happening outside, only sensing that Yang Kai had fought many people. Now, feeling the purity and strength of Yang Kai’s Origin Qi, she was secretly impressed.

She was also at the Dao Origin Realm now and thus understood the power differences at this level. She could clearly feel that Yang Kai’s Origin Qi had been fully transformed, far beyond anything she could compare it to.

Thinking back to when they first arrived in the Star Realm, her cultivation had been a bit higher than his, but now he had far surpassed her.

And it had only been two or three short years!

Chi Yue was very curious about what Yang Kai had experienced to grow so much in such a short time.

While Chi Yue was secretly shocked, Yang Kai had already begun to investigate. After a while, he frowned and muttered, “As expected, it’s not some secret technique, nor is there any trace of a restriction...”

Hearing this, Chi Yue kept winking at Yang Kai, trying to tell him something, but unable to use her Divine Sense or speak, she was completely helpless, as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.

Luo Jin watched everything from afar, sneering coldly, but made no move to interfere. He seemed very confident in the methods used by the middle-aged man, believing that Yang Kai could never break them.

“What on earth is it...” Yang Kai frowned deeply, searching carefully and not missing a single suspicious detail. The guests also watched curiously, growing more wary of the middle-aged man.

They had seen Yang Kai’s strength with their own eyes, but even he couldn’t find a way to break the control, showing just how strange the middle-aged man’s methods were.

Anyone dealing with such a person would have to be extremely cautious, for if he used this strange technique to control them, they would become nothing but walking corpses.

“How exactly are you controlling the bride?” Ye Qinghan, seeing Yang Kai busy for so long without results, couldn’t help but ask.

The middle-aged man shook his head repeatedly. “Don’t ask me, I don’t know anything.”

How could he dare reveal any clues? His whole family was in Tianhe City. If he let the secret slip, he would bring disaster upon them, and Luo Jin would never forgive him.

“Coward!” Ye Qinghan spat.

The middle-aged man’s face turned ashen, unable to retort, only watching Yang Kai with deep fear.

“Hmm...” Suddenly, Yang Kai seemed to discover something, his expression changing as he focused his Divine Sense on a certain spot in Chi Yue’s Dantian.

After a while, his eyes lit up and he exclaimed, “Puppet Sprout? It’s a Puppet Sprout?”

At these words, the middle-aged man’s mouth dropped open in shock. “How could you possibly recognize that? It’s been extinct for ages, no one should know of it.”

“So it really is a Puppet Sprout?” Yang Kai turned and grinned at the middle-aged man. “I wasn’t sure at first, but hearing you say so confirms it.”

The middle-aged man froze, then flew into a rage. “You tricked me!”

Du Xian slapped the middle-aged man hard on the forehead, sending him stumbling. With a mocking laugh, he said, “Your wits really are your greatest weakness. What a shame!”

Yang Kai laughed loudly. “Thanks!”

The middle-aged man was left dazed and miserable, feeling the world was full of malice. He turned in terror to Luo Jin. “City Lord, I didn’t tell him anything! He figured it out himself.”

“Useless!” Luo Jin snorted coldly.

The middle-aged man’s face stiffened, and he slumped to the ground, completely drained. But the next moment, as if remembering something, he shouted at Yang Kai, “So what if you know? Without my unique secret technique, you can’t remove it. If you want your honored mother-in-law safe, you’d better have them let me go and apologize to the City Lord!”

Even now, he tried to cling to Luo Jin, hoping for forgiveness.

“Shut him up!” Yang Kai said impatiently.

Ye Qinghan chopped the middle-aged man on the neck, knocking him out cleanly.
