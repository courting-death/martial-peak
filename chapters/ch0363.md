## Chapter 363 — Ignorance is No Excuse

Upon this thought, everyone became restless.

The son of the Yang Family from Zhongdu, what a noble identity that is!

A so-called first-class family is nothing in front of the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu. Moreover, the Yang Family is the foremost among the Eight Great Families, their status even more revered.

That young master from the Yang Family present here might very well be the future master of the Yang Family. Establishing good relations with him while he is still weak in power would certainly bring great benefits in the future; who would dare to offend him?

Unconsciously, Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng reined in their overbearing momentum, their gazes heavy as they scanned the crowd, as if, all of a sudden, they had been diminished.

Meanwhile, the members of the Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower looked at Yang Kai with a blend of suspicion and expectation. They all knew Yang Kai’s name and would naturally link him to the identity of the Yang Family's young master. However, they could not directly inquire, each of them eagerly trying to glean something from his expression.

Yang Kai’s face remained calm and his demeanor unruffled, showing no signs of abnormality, which only deepened their uncertainties.

Xiang Chu let out a bitter laugh, clasped his fists, and asked loudly, “Who is Young Master Yang?”

It was not that he didn’t know Yang Kai’s name, but rather, subconsciously, he did not dare associate him with the young master of the Yang Family. At this moment, Xiang Chu only hoped that the hidden young master of the Yang Family was within his camp.

His inquiry went unanswered.

Yang Kai merely chuckled strangely.

Swish, swish, swish...

Countless gazes converged upon him. Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, the pitch-black Jiao Dragon that had been circling above his head suddenly shot down.

In the blink of an eye, the thirty zhang long Jiao Dragon dove into Yang Kai’s body and vanished from sight.

Simultaneously, the overwhelming killing intent dissipated entirely, revealing only the ordinary True Essence Realm Sixth Stage martial artist standing before them.

The expressions of the Xiang Family and Nan Family members turned uneasy.

Yang Kai had now dispelled his final reliance at such a time, making it impossible for them not to ponder further.

Looking up at the sky, the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle was still circling, emitting a series of urgent cries.

Yang Kai curved his fingers and placed them in his mouth, producing a loud whistle.

As if receiving some command, the circling Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle responded joyfully and unfurled its wings, diving down from a height of several hundred zhang.

In an instant, it arrived above everyone's heads. Its bright eagle eyes watched the three from the Nan Family with a vigilant and hostile glare before leisurely landing on Yang Kai’s shoulder.

Drawing its wings close, the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle cawed as if showing off to the three from the Nan Family.

Suddenly, the color drained from the faces of those from the Nan Family and Xiang Family. Xiang Chu’s face twitched slightly as he looked toward Yang Kai, seemingly unable to believe his eyes.

The uniquely belonging Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family had now perched on Yang Kai’s shoulder; there was no need to further consider Yang Kai’s true identity.

The sisters from the Hu Family stared at Yang Kai, seemingly recognizing him anew, and their beautiful eyes sparkled with intrigue.

Xie Rong from Leiguang and Li Fu from Feihong Courtyard both felt their bodies weaken. They collapsed to the ground. Their two sects had strained themselves to please Xiang Chu, willing accomplices in their schemes against Yang Kai, yet they hadn’t expected to offend someone whom even Xiang Chu dared not provoke.

This was the true exemplification of being blind to the glaring truth, myopic!

Both of their factions suffered heavy casualties, with one elder from the Divine Roaming Realm falling at Yang Kai’s hands. They had expected Xiang Chu to seek revenge on their behalf while hoping to align themselves with the Xiang Family, but now…

All was in vain; far from seeking revenge, offending the young master of the Yang Family might cost them their lives.

No wonder he spoke of the price of offending him; the two factions could not bear it.

Indeed, they could not bear it!

“Young Master Yang?” Xiang Chu awkwardly looked at Yang Kai, his palms drenched in sweat, yet he had no choice but to toughen his resolve and ask.

Nan Sheng opened his mouth but found himself filled with regret and frustration.

He genuinely felt this was an unwarranted disaster. He merely passed through here on his way back to the Nan Family and got entangled in something so monumental. Had he known, he would have hurried back on his Treading Cloud Steed instead of seeking out this commotion.

In response to Xiang Chu’s inquiry, Yang Kai merely glanced at him indifferently, then focused on smoothing the feathers of the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle on his shoulder.

This Fifth-Tier flying demonic beast was quite special; its feathers resembled gold, shimmering brightly. Having been raised by the Yang Family for so many years, it was taken care of properly, each feather sharp as a blade, its hardness and sharpness rivaling an Earth-Grade Middle-Level treasure. Coupled with its hooked beak and sharp claws, a typical True Essence Realm martial artist might not stand a chance against it; at the very least, one would need a martial artist of the True Essence Realm Sixth or Seventh Stage to defeat it.

Yang Kai remained silent. No matter how aggrieved and furious Xiang Chu felt, he dared not show it, standing there with his fists clasped, an expression of utmost caution.

Nan Sheng's complexion flushed slightly, and, with some embarrassment, he said, “Young Master Yang, I failed to see clearly earlier. I hope you will forgive my earlier transgressions.”

Hu Jiao’er could not help but snicker disdainfully. Just moments ago, Nan Sheng had been so domineering, disregarding the several disciples of a second-rate sect, freely deciding their fates without allowing any resistance.

Yet now, before the young master of a superpower, he appeared so humble, barely restraining himself from kneeling to Yang Kai and admitting fault.

The contrast was stark, the difference in attitude striking.

The laughter reached Nan Sheng’s ears, making him feel increasingly uneasy. His face displayed a variety of emotions as he dry laughed, “Miss, please do not take offense; I owe you an apology.”

“Hmph!” Hu Jiao’er coldly laughed, turning her face away to avoid witnessing his disgraceful demeanor.

The four Divine Roaming Realm members from the Nan and Xiang Families had no choice but to swallow their pride, clasping their fists in unison as they said, “Young Master Yang, please forgive our earlier disrespect!”

Yang Kai gently exhaled, glancing at them with an indifferent expression, and chuckled lightly, “Ignorance is no excuse.”

Upon hearing this, the members of the Xiang Family and Nan Family all visibly relaxed.

Today’s incident was not worth mentioning as long as Yang Kai chose not to pursue it. Moreover, the struggle for supremacy within the Yang Family was about to commence, and as the direct descendant of the Yang Family, Yang Kai would naturally seek to gather support and rally allies in hopes of seizing the position of the next family master.

Both the Xiang Family and the Nan Family were first-class families! Such powerful allies, as long as Yang Kai still wished to win in the competition for succession, he would certainly seek to court them. As the saying goes, those who achieve great things do not concern themselves with trifles. Since today's events caused Yang Kai no harm, he could surely brush it off with a generous spirit.

Who knows, he might even build a friendship with the young master of the Yang Family and create a memorable tale of unexpected kinship.

Thoughts whirling in their minds, both Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng’s expressions turned joyful and filled with anticipation.

Just as they felt elated, the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle perched on Yang Kai’s shoulder suddenly let out a piercing shriek, as if injured, flapping its wings and soaring into the sky.

“What’s going on?” Xiang Chu urgently asked, and as the words left his mouth, he regarded Yang Kai with a bewildered and perplexed expression.

Others were equally perplexed.

They saw that Yang Kai’s hands now held two golden feathers, shimmering brilliantly like finely honed blades, identical in length, their shapes smooth; they were clearly plucked from the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle.

No wonder the majestic eagle suddenly took flight in alarm.

Having plucked the feathers, Yang Kai did not even cast a glance at them, tossing them directly to the ground.

“Young Master Yang, what do you mean by this?” Nan Sheng asked, his mind clouded, frowning at Yang Kai.

The Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle was majestic, visually stunning, and a rare and precious beast. Moreover, it had been a contributor to Yang Kai’s achievements; even if Yang Kai disliked it, he wouldn’t suddenly take action against it, would he?

What is he doing? Nan Sheng could not comprehend.

In contrast to Nan Sheng, Xiang Chu, with his sharper intuition, felt a hint of unease as he observed the two golden feathers in Yang Kai’s hand. However, before he could fully articulate his thoughts, two figures rapidly approached.

The pair moved at an incredible speed, their bodies radiating dazzling lights, making it clear they were not of lowly power.

Within moments, they covered the several hundred zhang distance.

The newcomers were a man and a woman; the man was robust, with a cold demeanor, featuring a long scar across his face that resembled a crawling worm, giving him a terrifying appearance, with deadly momentum emanating from him.

The woman, striking in her prime, possessed a graceful stature betraying her youth, her elegance undeniable. Her eyes sparkled with cunning intelligence, and her expression was devoid of emotion, exuding a cold indifference.

Regardless of gender, both were experts of the Divine Roaming Realm, but they exuded an undeniable dominance compared to the experts from the Xiang Family and Nan Family.

In that instant, everyone unconsciously compared them to the four Divine Roaming Realm members from the Nan and Xiang Families, only to arrive at the same conclusion: individually, none of the four stood a chance against this man and woman.

Each Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family would be accompanied by an expert from the Yang Family to escort the direct descendants back home once found.

The two before them evidently followed the Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle to this place.

Both were adorned with a jade token hung from their waists, inscribed with a blood-red character for Yang.

“Blood Servants of the Yang Family!” Elder Fang could not help but exclaim softly.

The Blood Servants of the Yang Family served the family for generations and were fiercely loyal. Each of them was exceptionally gifted, cultivated from an early age with significant investment in manpower, resources, and wealth to ensure their growth.

Their status might not rival that of the noble scions from prestigious families, but the achievements they could obtain were unmistakably no less than those of those scions.

There existed an elder from the Yang Family who had surpassed the Divine Roaming Realm and had once been a Blood Servant. Today, he was honored as a guest, and even direct disciples bowed in salutation upon meeting him.

Thus, the Blood Servants of the Yang Family also represented formidable combat power; all Blood Servants almost possessed the ability to battle above their ranks, essentially rendering them near invincible among equals.

What made them particularly valuable was their unwavering loyalty; for the Yang Family, they would be willing to sacrifice everything.

After all, from their childhood, the Yang Family instilled in them the ideology of family paramountcy, investing significant resources to foster them.
