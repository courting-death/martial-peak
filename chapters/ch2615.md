## Chapter 2615 — Great Elder

Yin Lesheng provoked such a formidable enemy and died for it. Although it was heartbreaking, who could blame anyone but himself for not opening his eyes and looking clearly? He even dragged the Netherworld Sect into losing two Emperor Realm Elders and a Vice Sect Master.

This time, the Netherworld Sect suffered a tremendous loss.

Fu Bo was convinced that it was Luan Feng who killed those people, so he didn’t even dare to think about revenge and softened his attitude. What worried him most now was whether the other party would let the matter rest. If they refused to let things go, it would undoubtedly be another disaster for the Netherworld Sect.

The Great Emperor’s personal arrival was no joke. If they weren’t careful, the Netherworld Sect might be erased from the Star Realm forever!

Yang Kai snorted, “Yin Lesheng provoked me again and again. I, being magnanimous, already showed great mercy by sparing him in the Shattered Star Sea, but I never thought he’d still try to cause me trouble, bringing me endless annoyance…"

You killed everyone, and you’re the one annoyed? The one truly troubled is this Lord! Fu Bo seethed inwardly but dared not retort.

“As the saying goes, if a son is not taught, it’s the father’s fault. Once a teacher, always a father. Yin Lesheng may be dead, but as his master, your responsibility is not small. If you had taught him well, he wouldn’t have been so stubborn and narrow-minded!”

Here it comes, as expected, the matter has implicated the Netherworld Sect—and himself.

Although he had anticipated this, hearing Yang Kai’s words still left Fu Bo full of resentment. He wished he’d never taken Yin Lesheng as a disciple, but things had come to this—there was no escaping it now.

“What do you want?” Fu Bo sighed.

Luan Feng stood behind Yang Kai, her phoenix eyes glaring at him, making his heart tremble. He feared that a single wrong word would anger her and give her an excuse to act.

Yang Kai snorted, “The psychological trauma and torment your disciple caused me are indelible. Even now, the memory makes my heart race and leaves me sleepless. It’s like being haunted by a malicious spirit, impossible to dispel…"

Fu Bo raised his hand to interrupt, dejectedly saying, “Name your price.”

He finally understood. Yang Kai hadn’t come to truly do anything to the Netherworld Sect or him as Sect Master—he was here to extort them.

Though it pained him, he also felt relieved. If paying a price could make the other party let things go, it was acceptable. But this price… would surely not be small.

Yang Kai glared sideways, “Sect Master Fu, aren’t you underestimating me? Do you think I can be bought so easily?”

Fu Bo was stunned. Did he misunderstand? He grew anxious, completely unsure what Yang Kai wanted from the Netherworld Sect this time.

But then Yang Kai changed his tone, stroking his chin, “However… if Sect Master Fu is truly sincere, I might be willing to let bygones be bygones.”

Fu Bo nearly spat blood in anger. Just now, Yang Kai had sounded so righteous—he thought Yang Kai was a man of principle. Who knew that in the blink of an eye, the fox’s tail would show.

So in the end, it was all just extortion…

Fu Bo’s expression darkened. “Just how much sincerity are you expecting from me?”

Yang Kai replied lightly, “If there were tens of millions, or even a hundred million Source Crystals, I might just forget about your sect’s people causing me trouble and finally get a good night’s sleep.”

“Tens of millions… a hundred million…” Fu Bo was shocked, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead. “Middle-Level Source Crystals?”

“Ridiculous!” Yang Kai’s expression turned fierce as he glared at Fu Bo. “It seems Sect Master Fu’s sincerity isn’t enough to quell my anger! Lady Feng!”

At his shout, Luan Feng immediately stepped forward. “What are your orders, Sir Yang!”

“Wait, wait, wait!” Fu Bo was startled as soon as Luan Feng stepped out. He quickly raised his hand to stop her, cold sweat pouring down as his body shrank. He asked weakly, “You mean… Upper-Level Source Crystals?”

Yang Kai let out a cold laugh. “Sect Master Fu, why pretend you don’t understand when you clearly do?”

Fu Bo couldn’t help but swallow. Only now did he realize how big Yang Kai’s appetite was.

Tens of millions, even a hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals—while the Netherworld Sect could produce that, it would be a crippling blow. Though the Netherworld Sect was a top sect in the Eastern Territory and controlled many Source Crystal mines, with so many disciples and such a large operation, their consumption was also huge.

If they really met Yang Kai’s demands, the disciples’ cultivation resources would be drastically reduced for years to come.

Fu Bo was furious. His sect’s Vice Sect Master, two Great Elders, and even his personal disciple had been killed. Now the enemy came to extort him, and with such outrageous demands! Anyone would be upset, but his fist wasn’t as big as theirs—he could only swallow his anger.

Just as Fu Bo hesitated, a voice suddenly came from outside the hall: “Sect Master, Zhou Yong requests an audience!”

“Great Elder!” Fu Bo frowned, wondering why the Great Elder had come at this moment. He was already in dire straits and didn’t want anyone to see his embarrassment. But then he thought, with another person, maybe they could come up with a solution. After all, the Great Elder wasn’t an outsider.

With that thought, Fu Bo called out, “Come in!”

To the side, Yang Kai glanced at Luan Feng, a smile on his lips.

Luan Feng looked cold and snorted softly.

When they first entered the Netherworld Sect, Luan Feng killed a man who tried to abduct her. That man had introduced himself as the Great Elder’s grandson.

Now, with the Great Elder of the Netherworld Sect coming in person, how could she not know why he was here?

Clearly, he was here for revenge.

Indeed, that was exactly the case. The alluring woman who had accompanied the slain man, after pointing Yang Kai and his companions in the right direction, immediately went to seek an audience with the Great Elder. She reported everything that had transpired in detail.

The Great Elder was furious. Learning that Yang Kai and the others had come to see Fu Bo, he rushed over at once.

His grandson had been killed within the sect—how could he let that go? Not only was that his only grandson, but the killer’s arrogance was also a slap in the face.

Outside the hall, Zhou Yong entered with a face as cold as ice, killing intent almost tangible. After greeting Fu Bo, he immediately looked at the two women behind Yang Kai.

He’d heard from a Third Stage Dao Origin Realm disciple that the killer was a dignified, elegant woman.

Luan Feng and Ji Yao had very different temperaments, so Zhou Yong quickly identified the culprit.

At this moment, Fu Bo was frowning, pondering how to explain the situation to the Great Elder so he could help, completely unaware of Zhou Yong’s anger and murderous intent.

Before he could react, Zhou Yong suddenly shouted, “Wretched woman, was it you who killed this Lord’s grandson?”

“Hm?” Fu Bo snapped out of it, looking at Zhou Yong in shock. “Great Elder, what are you saying?”

Did he hear that right? The Great Elder just called someone a wretched woman?

Zhou Yong pointed at Luan Feng behind Yang Kai, his fury blazing. “Sect Master, it was this vile woman who slaughtered Zhou Ji in the sect! He was my only grandson!”

“Zhou Ji?” Fu Bo frowned. “That good-for-nothing?”

He obviously knew Zhou Ji—after all, he was the Great Elder’s grandson. If it had been an ordinary disciple, Fu Bo wouldn’t have remembered; with tens of thousands in the sect, why would he care about a mere First Stage Dao Origin Realm cultivator? But Zhou Ji’s status made him impossible to ignore.

He was the Great Elder’s grandson.

Fu Bo had long heard of him, knowing he was a troublemaker who relied on his grandfather’s backing to act recklessly.

Still, the boy had never harmed the sect’s foundation or talented female disciples, so for the Great Elder’s sake, Fu Bo had let him be.

Who would have thought that this wastrel would be killed—and killed within the sect, by someone even Fu Bo feared.

Zhou Yong was heartbroken. “Ji’er may have been a bit unruly, but he was young. With my guidance, he could have achieved great things. But now he’s dead! Killed by this wretched woman! My Zhou family… is finished!”

Fu Bo’s face was as black as the bottom of a pot. He glanced at Luan Feng, then shouted, “Great Elder, enough!”

This was a Great Emperor-level existence. How could Zhou Yong be so blind, repeatedly insulting her? If he angered her, what good could come of it?

For a moment, Fu Bo regretted everything. If he’d known, he’d never have let Zhou Yong in. Instead of helping, he’d only made things worse.

Zhou Yong raged, “Sect Master, even if they are your guests, I must avenge my grandson!”

He thought Yang Kai and the others were only here because they were Fu Bo’s guests.

But even if they were, he wasn’t afraid. As a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert and the Netherworld Sect’s Great Elder, his status was second to none. Zhou Yong believed the Sect Master would side with him.

But things didn’t go as Zhou Yong expected. Fu Bo’s face darkened, and he barked angrily, “Great Elder, I urge you to consider the greater good!”

“The greater good?” Zhou Yong sneered. “My line is finished—what greater good is there? If you won’t help me today, I’ll leave the Netherworld Sect and kill these people myself!”

Fu Bo trembled, realizing the trouble he was in. “What nonsense are you spouting?”

The Vice Sect Master was dead, two Elders were dead, and if the Great Elder left, the Netherworld Sect’s strength would plummet. Even as a Third Stage Emperor Realm Sect Master, he might not be able to hold things together.

“I beg the Sect Master to allow it!” Zhou Yong cupped his fists, his attitude resolute.

His earlier words were just a tactic—he didn’t really want to leave the Netherworld Sect. He’d given his life to the sect, and his ties ran deep. It wasn’t so easy to sever them.
