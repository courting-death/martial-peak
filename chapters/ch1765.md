## Chapter 1765 — You Still Know How to Be Shy?

Yang Kai resented Xu Wei for using him as a means to escape, so he naturally could not let it go; taking advantage of the instant Xu Wei laughed arrogantly and relaxed his guard, he directly unleashed the Blooming Lotus secret art.

That was not all — with a flick of his wrist, his Dragon Bone sword, Dripping Jade, shot forth, and amid a lofty dragon roar a jade-green giant dragon thrashed its head and tail toward Xu Wei, its gaping maw spewing a rank breath that was highly toxic and corrosive.

Xu Wei's smile froze on his face in an instant, his eyeballs trembling slightly.

He had never expected an Origin Returning Realm cultivator like Yang Kai to strike with such extraordinariness.

In the next instant, he felt a surge of pure Soul power crash against the barrier of his Sea of Consciousness, causing his Void King Realm-level defenses to tremble violently and crack open a fissure. Through that gap, the refined Divine Sense power poured into his Sea of Consciousness, transforming into a lotus that absorbed its strength and slowly began to bloom.

Head splitting pain! Xu Wei could not help but let out a miserable scream, hastily steadying his mind and rushing Sea of Consciousness power to resist that strange lotus.

Fortunately his cultivation was not weak; although ambushed by Yang Kai without warning, he was not utterly ruined — once his Sea of Consciousness power was mobilized, the slowly unfurling lotus was completely suppressed.

Still, to purge it entirely required some effort.

Xu Wei had no time to deal with the anomaly in his Sea of Consciousness, for the jade-green giant dragon had already opened its maw and lunged before him; in the face of that beast he was as insignificant as an ant.

Seeing the dragon ready to swallow him in one bite, Xu Wei gritted his teeth; a deeper crimson radiance flared about his body, his speed surged, and he narrowly evaded the dragon's strike.

When he reappeared, he was ten li away, though his face was slightly pale and his breathing rapid.

He had fled for a long time with Kong Fa, then clashed with countless Illusory Void Butterflies, expended two more hugely draining secret arts, and had even been ambushed by Yang Kai's Blooming Lotus secret art...

Even as a Void King Realm expert, he could not keep that up for long.

He turned back with venom in his eyes, gazing at the besieged Yang Kai and Xue Yue, and hissed in a rough roar, "Kid, you better pray you die here, otherwise I'll make you regret being born into this world!"

To be a Void King Realm and be ambushed by a junior from the Origin Returning Realm was an utter humiliation; fortunately no one else had witnessed that scene, so he saved a measure of face; after shouting he did not linger and immediately fled.

Xu Wei did not believe Yang Kai and Xue Yue could survive the attacks of so many Illusory Void Butterflies!

Even he would not be certain of escape in such circumstances himself; otherwise he would not have gone to such lengths to use the two juniors.

"Hmph!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, halted where he stood, and did not advance.

Because of Xu Wei’s interference, he and Xue Yue now had no path left to escape.

The Illusory Void Butterflies surrounding them were now twice as many as before, since Xu Wei had vanished and the butterflies that had been attacking him had shifted their target.

More than twenty Blood Beasts were released once again by Yang Kai, forming a protective ring to draw the butterflies' attention, and the jade-green giant dragon born of the Dragon Bone sword joined the fray, shining brilliantly.

Standing beside Yang Kai, Xue Yue's expression was grave, sweat beading at her nostrils; the secret treasure bracelet she wore was continually invoked, consuming vast Saint Yuan, yet she showed no sign of giving up — as she slaughtered foes she shoved Spiritual Pills into her mouth to restore her Saint Yuan.

Even her companion yao spirit, Xiezhi, was unleashed by Xue Yue.

That companion yao spirit was immensely powerful; in raw combat strength it was not at all inferior to Xue Yue herself. Years ago in the Imperial Garden, Xue Yue had even used this companion yao spirit to fight Shan Qingluo's Heavenly Moon Demon Spider to a standstill, showing how vicious it was.

Even so, the situation could not be turned around — the radiance on the Blood Beasts flickered as if about to collapse, and the defensive ring had at times shrunk.

"Why do you look so unconcerned?" Xue Yue suddenly turned to Yang Kai and asked oddly; her hands did not idle, unleashing powerful secret arts that could wipe out swarms of Illusory Void Butterflies and ease the Blood Beasts' burden.

Only then did she notice that Yang Kai wore an untroubled, breezy expression, utterly lacking the anxious look one should have at the end of the road.

"Worry about what?" Yang Kai chuckled, replying as he manipulated the Golden Blood Threads, precisely reaping the lives of the Illusory Void Butterflies.

"Aren't you afraid of death?" Influenced by his demeanor, Xue Yue's expression calmed considerably.

“Nonsense!” Yang Kai curled his lips. “Who isn’t afraid of death? But… as the saying goes, to die beneath the peony flower—one would still be a merry ghost!”

Xue Yue froze for a moment, then glared at Yang Kai, "At a time like this, you still have the mood for jokes?"

Yang Kai gave a wry laugh and said nothing more.

Though the situation appeared perilous, to him it was actually easy to resolve; he had at least two ways to shake off the Illusory Void Butterflies' entanglement.

The simplest was to bring out the Xuan Realm Pearl, hide inside it with Xue Yue, and vanish — the butterflies would have no reason to linger.

Alternatively, he could tear open the void and flee through space.

The spatial fluctuations here, though chaotic, could disturb his spatial power, but escaping one or two hundred li in a single bound was no problem; the only worry was accidentally encountering danger in the void.

Both methods were effective, and Yang Kai was fully confident in succeeding.

But... such moves would necessarily expose some of his trump cards, especially the Xuan Realm Pearl — that kind of object formed its own world within, its existence too extraordinary, and Yang Kai was loath to reveal it to Xue Yue.

After all, she was the Hengluo Commerce Guild's Young Master, and his relationship with her was not one in which he could comfortably share such secrets.

So he kept considering how he could have his cake and eat it too.

"Yang Kai..." Xue Yue suddenly called softly.

"What?" Yang Kai turned to look at her, sensing a strange tone in her voice.

"Have you always hated me?" Xue Yue asked, her gaze drifting and avoiding Yang Kai's eyes.

"What would I hate you for?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment.

"Because I once set people to chase you... and I made things hard for you, sometimes abusing my power to bully others," Xue Yue said softly.

"Ha!" Yang Kai laughed out loud.

"What's so funny?" Xue Yue frowned, displeased as she looked at Yang Kai; she had wanted to talk seriously, but his casual manner made her feel unappreciated.

Yang Kai looked at her mischievously, a smile at his lips, clicking his tongue, "The Hengluo Commerce Guild's Young Master can be so sentimental — a woman is a woman after all!"

Those words seemed to poke a hornet's nest; Xue Yue bit her lip and snapped coquettishly, "I am a woman — so what? I was born a woman; I never wanted to be a man. Do you think I like it? All these years, who has cared about my feelings?"

As she spoke she even pressed hard at her chest.

With a flash of radiance, Xue Yue standing before Yang Kai changed her appearance in an instant.

She was no longer the imposing masculine figure from before but a stunning beauty whose features could topple a city: her posture supple, long hair falling to her hips, her bosom firm and rounded; she fixed Yang Kai with wide, dazzling eyes, her silver teeth clenched as if about to devour him.

Coupled with the men's clothing she had been wearing, Xue Yue now carried a different kind of seduction.

Yang Kai stared in surprise, awkwardly rubbing his nose, "I was just kidding — why such a big reaction?"

Xue Yue merely glared at him, her eyes flashing the familiar mingled light of love and hate that Yang Kai knew so well.

“Hey…” Yang Kai looked helpless. “Are you really fine being like this? If someone were to see you, it wouldn’t look too good for your Commerce Guild. And if anyone happened to notice your special physique, you might just get abducted.”

Xue Yue's special constitution was a tremendous temptation even to Void King Realm cultivators — the Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body was the sort of thing almost impossible to come by; any man who obtained Xue Yue's yuan-yin could safely and dramatically increase his strength.

Xue Yue's yuan-yin was like the finest Spiritual Pill; for those Void King Realm cultivators who had struggled for years without improving their power, it was an unimaginable temptation.

Even given her status as the Hengluo Commerce Guild's Young Master, there would surely be people willing to risk everything to seize her.

The world had never lacked the desperate and the mad.

Xue Yue snorted coldly, coquettishly sweeping back a lock of hair, slanting her eyes at Yang Kai and drawling, "Besides you and me, who else is here? Besides, you've long known I'm a woman and long known my special constitution, yet you never showed interest — what, am I utterly without allure?"

"Why bring this up now?" Yang Kai's face instantly became awkward; though savvy in matters between the sexes, some women remained baffling to him.

In such a place and under such circumstances, Xue Yue actually discussing this left him at a loss for an answer.

"You shameless scoundrel who still knows how to be shy?" Xue Yue herself flushed slightly, yet she sneered at Yang Kai, "I never knew your face could be so thin-skinned — back on that Dead Star, how could you be so shameless?"

"That was an accident, okay?" Yang Kai glared at her, "It happened years ago — why bring it up now? Didn't we agree to forget it together?"

"Who agreed? I will never forget that." Xue Yue's bosom heaved violently; anger erupted and with a sweep of her hand countless incoming Illusory Void Butterflies were killed on the spot.

"Fine, what do you want to do?" Yang Kai looked at her dejectedly, "Say it plainly — you're making me confused."

"What do I want to do!" Xue Yue ground her teeth and cried, "What do you think I want? What else can I do?"

She looked utterly hysterical, shouting three times in succession. Beneath her fury, there even seemed to be a trace of grievance.
