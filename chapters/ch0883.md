## Chapter 883 — Time Has Come

But when Yang Kai produced several Saint‑Grade Secret Treasures at once—treasures that would make the world envious—Li Rong's feelings were utterly shaken; she was left speechless.

Li Rong couldn't help but suspect that Yang Kai had looted the vaults of several major sects...

Otherwise, how could he have gathered so many Saint‑Grade Secret Treasures?

Though shocked, she made no fuss and accepted the items from Yang Kai, putting them away.

She knew better than anyone that the stronger the Ancient Demon Clan grew, the more it could support Yang Kai! These treasures would greatly enhance the combat power of her, Han Fei, and the others.

"Let's go back," Yang Kai said after identifying the direction, returning along the way they had come.

There were no landmarks in the starry sky, but Yang Kai's Divine Sense was sharp enough that they wouldn't easily get lost.

Who knew how much time had passed; once more they arrived at the entrance to the Void Passage, slipped inside, and when they reappeared they had indeed returned to the stone forest by Poxuan Palace.

The surrounding stone pillars still trembled, rings of ripples spreading outward; where those ripples collided at the center they underwent strange changes, forming an entrance into the starry sky.

With a sweep of his hand the pillars suddenly fell silent, and the entrance to the starry sky gradually vanished.

Heaven and earth fell quiet once again.

"Master, this place is so important—should we set some restrictions here? To prevent someone from stumbling in and accidentally breaking it," Li Rong asked solicitously.

"You can?" Yang Kai looked at her in surprise.

Li Rong smiled lightly. "I know a little. It won't be for show, but it should be better than the original safeguards here."

"Good." Yang Kai nodded; he had been thinking of posting guards, and Li Rong's suggestion fit him perfectly.

With Yang Kai's permission, Li Rong immediately began arranging protections nearby.

To be frank, Yang Kai had never studied restrictions and formations much; he could break them, but not set them.

Seeing Li Rong about to perform such methods, he was eager to learn and stood beside her to watch.

Li Rong did not conceal anything; she explained as she arranged things, and Yang Kai gained much.

After several hours, hidden restrictions were placed around the stone pillars; even if Yang Kai probed with Divine Sense he could not perceive them all.

"Impressive. If I have time I'll study this with you more," Yang Kai said, giving her a thumbs up.

Receiving his praise, Li Rong suddenly glowed with pride; she pursed her lips and said, "You flatter me, Master—it's only a small skill."

"Let's head back first." Yang Kai chuckled; he cared a great deal about that long shuttle Secret Treasure and wanted to refine it to uncover its purpose.

The two of them immediately flew toward the Sacred Land.

By the time they returned from Poxuan Palace to outside the Nine Peaks and before they could enter the Sacred Land, Yang Kai sensed a convergence of many life presences at one spot; indistinctly, noisy clamoring came from there.

Yang Kai frowned and, together with Li Rong, headed that way.

As they drew closer, the commotion grew clearer.

It sounded like many people shouting, their tones fierce, their voices aggrieved and indignant.

They were all accusing the Nine Heavens Sacred Land of abusing its power and bullying the weak, and amid the complaints one could hear the Sacred Land elder Shi Kun's scolding.

Yang Kai quickened his pace and soon arrived at the scene; frowning, he asked, "What happened?"

Hearing Yang Kai's voice, Shi Kun quickly turned his head; seeing Yang Kai stride over with Li Rong at his side his expression changed and he cupped his fists, saying, "Greetings, Saint Lord!"

"Saint Lord?" The disputing martial artists fell silent at once and turned to look at Yang Kai, wanting to see what the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land looked like.

But in the next moment, all eyes were drawn to Li Rong.

Graceful and stately, elegant and understanding at a glance—she was clearly a woman of gentle sensibility, her figure slender yet full.

Her skin was fair as jade, giving off a porcelain sheen; at the sight of Li Rong, people's gazes fixed on her.

They paused their quarrel and displayed lascivious, entranced expressions.

Li Rong narrowed her brows and gave a cold sweep with a small huff from her delicate nose.

An invisible force radiated out, making everyone's faces blanch; in an instant their minds wavered, and the beautiful woman before them seemed to transform into a ferocious beast brandishing claws and roaring.

They couldn't help but avert their gazes, trembling with fear and shock.

Yang Kai glanced at Li Rong and couldn't help but smile in mute amusement.

He thought that if she kept everyone from looking at her like this in the future, it would become quite troublesome.

All living beings, whether male or female, had no immunity to beauty; when they saw a beauty they naturally stole glances.

Li Rong had always lived in Mogu Castle, where her clansmen treated her with utmost respect and never dared harbor improper thoughts. Coming out into the wider world, scenes like that were bound to appear often.

"You'll get used to it," Yang Kai murmured comfortingly. Li Rong's face flushed; realizing she'd gone too far, she nodded lightly.

Given her cultivation and status, using covert means to deal with such a rabble was indeed inappropriate.

"What's going on here?" Yang Kai asked Shi Kun.

Shi Kun hastily replied, "Reporting to you, Saint Lord: these people have been wandering outside our Nine Peaks for some time. By order of the Great Elder I gave them three days to withdraw. The deadline is almost up, but they refuse to leave, insisting we are abusing our power. I had no choice but to argue with them."

Yang Kai nodded and asked, "Where is Xu Hui?"

"The Great Elder has other matters to attend to, so he left this matter to me."

As they spoke, those in the crowd who had been startled by Li Rong's display recovered; a man in a yellow robe began shouting, "So you're the new Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land?"

Yang Kai turned to him and nodded slightly, "Yes. What do you have to say?"

"Don't flatter yourself!" the yellow‑robed man sneered. "We were hunting for treasures here and didn't provoke your Nine Heavens Sacred Land. On what basis do you drive us away?"

"On what basis?" Yang Kai grinned. "This is my Nine Peaks. On what basis do you claim the right to be here?"

"We're not in the Nine Peaks, we're just nearby—are we really in the way? Are you policing too widely?" the yellow‑robed man scoffed. "Or do you think because our cultivation isn't high we can be bullied at will? Our realms may be low, but that doesn't mean anyone can pick on us."

He puffed out his chest and struck a posture of 'I'd rather die than be insulted.'

His words stirred shared indignation; a chorus of shouts rose up and the crowd's anger turned toward the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Shi Kun shouted angrily, "Shut up if you value your life—who dares act insolently before my Saint Lord?"

His words poured fuel on the fire. The yellow‑robed man cried, "Did you all hear that? The elders of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land want to kill us! Time immemorial, the Nine Heavens Sacred Land has been a golden name among human powers; people said its people were gentle and loyal, but now look at this! Since the old Saint Lord passed, has this generation's Saint Lord turned wicked? Is the corruption at the top trickling down?"

"Indeed, I heard this generation's Saint Lord has colluded with demons, raising a group of demonic humans within the Nine Peaks!"

This caused an uproar; the crowd buzzed and looked at Yang Kai with suddenly altered expressions.

The yellow‑robed man stood amid the crowd, beaming with triumph as if to say, 'What can you do to me?'

Li Rong's face flushed with anger and she said softly, "Master, he seems to be taking advantage of your youth."

"Then he's miscalculated." Yang Kai sneered and asked Shi Kun, "How much time remains on the Great Elder's deadline?"

Shi Kun looked up at the sky and said gravely, "At most, no more than the time it takes to finish a cup of tea."

Yang Kai nodded slightly and addressed the crowd, "I won't waste words. If you haven't left in the time it takes to finish a cup of tea, be prepared to die here."

Seeing Yang Kai's smile, which didn't look like a joke, many felt fear and involuntarily retreated a few steps.

"What are you afraid of?" the yellow‑robed man shouted. "They wouldn't dare kill, would they? We haven't done anything against the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—are we to be killed merely for lingering nearby? If they're that tyrannical, someone will avenge us!"

"Right, people act by reason—on what grounds do they dare kill?" someone chimed in.

"If we leave now we'll forever miss out on those treasures. They want to hoard the treasures, so they're chasing us away."

...

Yang Kai said nothing and simply stood smiling there, letting them shout on.

Those who had planned to leave were thus swayed and stopped, deciding to wait and see.

Deep down they still couldn't believe a great power like the Nine Heavens Sacred Land would kill without cause, especially with the new Saint Lord present.

"Saint Lord, time's up!" Shi Kun suddenly said.

Yang Kai nodded and, across the crowd, gazed deeply at the yellow‑robed man with a look full of mockery.

Under that stare the yellow‑robed man's hairs stood on end; he felt like a snake under a glare, cold dread rising, yet he blustered, "What are you looking at, boy? Don't think that being the new Saint Lord lets you act as you please—you were just lucky! If the Saintess favored me, I'd be far superior to you!"

"Is that so?" Yang Kai's mouth curved into an odd, inscrutable smile as he tilted his head and said, "You seem to assume I wouldn't dare kill. Who gave you such confidence?"

The yellow‑robed man's face changed and he hissed, "If you start killing people here, how are you any different from demons? How will your Nine Heavens Sacred Land stand in the world afterward?"

Yang Kai slowly shook his head, "Did someone really tell you that? Are you stupid enough to believe it?"

As he spoke, Yang Kai suddenly grew impatient; a flash of merciless coldness appeared in his eyes and he barked, "A measly First Stage of the Transcendent Realm—trash—let it die. Do you think anyone will stand up for you?"
