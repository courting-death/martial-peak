## Chapter 377 — Don't Disturb the Eagle's Meal

Within the Yang Family, it seemed that only one Golden Feather Eagle had successfully evolved to the Sixth-Tier, and that Golden Feather Eagle was the leader of all the young eagles!

In order to facilitate the evolution of that Golden Feather Eagle, the Yang Family had expended considerable financial and material resources. In the end, it was merely luck that enabled the Golden Feather Eagle to advance.

Since that time, no other Golden Feather Eagle from the Yang Family had reached the Sixth-Tier. As time passed, the disparity between investment and return grew wider, leading the Yang Family to abandon any further hopes for the evolution of the Golden Feather Eagle.

After all, the strength of the Yang Family did not rely on the Golden Feather Eagle. The primary roles of these young eagles were reconnaissance and searching for direct bloodline descendants.

For the capital-wealthy Yang Family, the distinction between Fifth-Tier and Sixth-Tier was, indeed, negligible.

But for Yang Kai, it was a different story.

If the Golden Feather Eagle before him could evolve to the Sixth-Tier, its capabilities would increase exponentially, allowing it to contend even against experts of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Given the current circumstances, aside from needing to subdue the two Blood Servants beside him, Yang Kai could only think of this Golden Feather Eagle.

In the battle for succession, even the smallest assistance could sway the outcome.

The Wan Yao Ling Ye was something Yang Kai consumed daily. This substance, when taken long-term, could enable a transformation, cleansing one's meridians and marrow, and would undoubtedly benefit the Golden Feather Eagle as well.

After so many days, the Golden Feather Eagle had completely grown reliant on Yang Kai. This was not merely due to the effect of the Slave Beast Seal, but rather because of its relatively high intelligence.

With a flicker of his eyes, Yang Kai reached out and flicked his finger against the Golden Feather Eagle.

A sound like something shattering resonated, and ripples spread out from within the Golden Feather Eagle, fading into nothingness.

That was the sound of the Slave Beast Seal being undone by Yang Kai.

Without the Slave Beast Seal, the Golden Feather Eagle tilted its head to look at Yang Kai, its bright eyes showing some confusion. However, it exhibited no signs of rejection; rather, it continued to groom Yang Kai's hair as it had before.

"Hehe!" Yang Kai chuckled lightly.

The time spent together had subtly ingrained this obedience in the Golden Feather Eagle, allowing it to heed Yang Kai's commands even without the Slave Beast Seal.

Demonic Beasts were not hard to deal with; after taking the Wan Yao Ling Ye for over ten days, the Golden Feather Eagle had completely devoted itself to him, remaining loyal and would not expose Yang Kai's secrets.

"It's time to eat!" A sly smile spread across Yang Kai's face as he motioned in one direction. With a flick of his hand, he sent the Golden Feather Eagle soaring.

Wings unfurled, the Golden Feather Eagle took off and captured a porcupine prepared in a blood meal cage specifically for it by the Lü Family, then shot straight into the sky.

The porcupine was hefty, and it seemed the Golden Feather Eagle was struggling to hold onto it. When they reached mid-air, its claws loosened, and with a "thud," the porcupine plummeted to the ground.

After a while, a splattering sound was heard, as if blood had sprayed, and the Golden Feather Eagle circled and dove towards the fresh blood meal.

Yang Kai slowly rose, tidied his attire, and stepped out of the courtyard towards the residence where the Golden Feather Eagle had landed.

…

In the Lü Family's great hall.

Lü Liang was discussing important matters with several senior members of the Lü Family when a servant rushed in. Lü Liang's expression changed, and he sternly demanded, "What is it?"

The servant quickly knelt, panic stricken, and said, "Master, it’s bad! Elder Si's courtyard is stained with blood!"

"What?" Lü Liang sprang up from his chair, the other senior members of the Lü Family also displaying alarm.

It seemed a significant incident had occurred.

"What exactly happened?" Without hesitation, Lü Liang hastily walked out, lifting the servant along with him, urgently asking.

He couldn't afford to remain calm.

Elder Si! Lü Si!

He was the only expert beyond the Divine Roaming Realm in the Lü Family, a figure standing at the pinnacle of this world. It was solely due to his existence that the Lü Family could be regarded as a prestigious clan.

The preservation of Lü Si directly affected the status of the Lü Family.

Under normal circumstances, Lü Si would never leave the Lü Family; he would only sit in place, intimidating any underhanded individuals.

Furthermore, due to some issues when Lü Si ascended to the Divine Roaming Realm a few years back, it was inconvenient for him to leave the Lü Family. He typically closed himself off within his own courtyard, which was forbidden territory for anyone, including Lü Liang, the family head. Unless a matter of utmost importance relating to the family's survival arose, he would not dare disturb him.

But now, blood had unexpectedly stained Elder Si's courtyard!

How could this not cause concern among them?

The servant failed to explain clearly; upon hearing the words "blood," everyone assumed something terrible had happened during Lü Si's practice, causing him to be injured, which resulted in the blood.

Once the servant recounted his account, Lü Liang and the others finally breathed a sigh of relief.

They felt a mix of anger and amusement, cursing the servant's clumsiness in his panic-stricken speech.

However... the fact that a porcupine had fallen in Elder Si's courtyard was still a matter of substantial concern. Should it disturb Elder Si's closed-door training, it would be no trivial matter.

According to the servant, the issue was that the Golden Feather Eagle from the Yang Family had not held on tightly while eating, causing the porcupine to accidentally fall into Lü Si's courtyard. He had peered through the courtyard gate from afar and saw a bloody scene.

The servant did not dare to intrude upon Elder Si, which was why he had to rush in to report.

"That will be all." After listening, Lü Liang released the servant and continued to walk swiftly towards Lü Si's residence, his expression displeased.

The other Lü Family members wore similar expressions.

Looking around, they found no trace of Yang Kai or the two Blood Servants. Someone whispered, "Master, that young master of the Yang Family really seems useless; he even failed to manage a single eagle, and has disturbed Elder Si!"

"Indeed, we need to hurry and send them away."

"But they were brought here by Miss Qiu. If they refuse to leave, can we just chase them away?"

"Why is this kind of frivolous young master accompanying Miss Qiu?"

As they talked about Yang Kai, they all shook their heads slowly, clearly unimpressed, thinking he was not up to par, merely possessing the status of a direct descendant of the Yang Family. If he were to participate in the succession battle, he would likely fall quickly.

"Enough!" Lü Liang admonished sternly.

Although he also did not hold high hopes for Yang Kai, it was not the place of Lü Family members to speak ill of him behind his back. If Yang Kai and the Blood Servants overheard, it would certainly invite unnecessary troubles.

With one admonishing sentence from Lü Liang, everyone in the Lü Family fell silent.

Before long, they arrived at the most secluded and quiet courtyard in the Lü Family.

As they approached, everyone frowned, their expressions aghast.

The courtyard's door was wide open, which was unusual as Lü Si's courtyard had always been tightly shut, and no one dared to open it.

Now, it stood open—what was going on?

Lü Liang held his breath, cautiously peeking inside. His face turned ashen with rage, nearly causing him to faint.

Inside the previously pristine, secluded courtyard, there was now a large pool of blood and shredded meat.

The tragic remains of the porcupine were vaguely visible, suggesting it had fallen from a height and landed with enough force to splatter blood everywhere—it had died without even a whimper.

The Golden Feather Eagle of the Yang Family was greedily devouring the fresh meat nearby.

And there was young master Yang Kai, squatting on the ground like a country bumpkin, arms crossed, intently watching the Golden Feather Eagle feast, with a faint, curious smile on his face.

Lü Liang rolled his eyes, so furious that steam seemed to rise from his head.

In the face of Elder Si, anyone from the Lü Family had to be extremely careful; nobody dared to cross the threshold of this courtyard. Yet this young master had strolled in as if it were an unguarded environment, stopping to appreciate the evidence of the destruction caused by his family's Demonic Beast, behaving as though he were at home!

In that moment, Lü Liang inexplicably felt a surge of humiliation.

It was as if the precious thing he treated with utmost caution was being taken freely by someone else.

All in all, his emotions were exceedingly complicated.

"Master..." The members of the Lü Family also stood frozen, unsure of how to proceed.

Lingering in anxiety served no purpose. Lü Liang darkened his expression, steeling himself to step inside. Observing their family head entering, the others naturally followed him in.

They had never entered Elder Si's residence before, but this time, they owed it to Yang Kai.

Walking directly to Yang Kai's side, Lü Liang took a deep breath, bent slightly, and cupped his hands, calling out, "Young Master Yang, Young Master Yang!"

Yang Kai seemed to become aware of someone approaching, promptly turned to look, surprised, and returned a casual greeting, "Lü Family Head."

Lü Liang's expression twitched slightly, but he could not be bothered to address his etiquette issues. Just as he was about to explain the situation, Yang Kai raised a finger and placed it against his lips, his demeanor serious as he shushed him.

Lü Liang was momentarily taken aback, whispering, "What’s wrong?"

Yang Kai smiled silently, pointing ahead, "Don't speak. You'll disturb the eagle's meal."

Lü Liang nearly lost his composure.

Eagle? At a time like this, he was still concerned about the eagle? This was Elder Si's secluded place for closed-door training; even if he was the young master of the Yang Family, and that was the Yang Family's Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle, it couldn't be compared to Lü Si!

Disturbing the eagle's meal? The family head was still worried that you were just here idly and would disturb Elder Si!

No matter how composed and wise Lü Liang was, he felt a surge of impulse to curse, quickly taking a few deep breaths, forcing a smile that was uglier than crying, and softly said, "Young Master Yang, this is not a place for discussion. Could we move to speak elsewhere?"

"Um." Yang Kai nodded in agreement, “Whatever you wish to say, let’s talk about it later. Let it eat its fill first!"

Lü Liang’s body shook, nearly staggering. At that moment, he truly felt like he could spit out blood.

He even had the sensation of being at a loss for words, as if a scholar confronted by soldiers, unable to articulate his reasoning.

Lü Liang’s usual eloquence utterly failed him at this moment, facing Yang Kai, who appeared utterly unyielding, he felt as if his tongue had tied, "Young Master Yang, I meant, can we talk after stepping outside?"
