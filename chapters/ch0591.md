## Chapter 591 — Zhongdu Earth Vein

Elsewhere, the Destruction Poison King displayed his poison mastery to the fullest extent, yet under the assault of numerous powerful opponents, he looked somewhat overwhelmed, panting heavily. Upon hearing a remark, he laughed heartily, “Indeed, our Lord will no longer concern himself with us. Otherwise, why have we not seen him intervene? He must have fled long ago.”

“Nonsense!” the Heaven-Dominating Force King howled hysterically. “How could our Lord have fled? He must be plotting a deadly move, one that will annihilate all of Zhongdu in one fell swoop!”

“Idiot!” the Poison King and the Ghost King sneered contemptuously in unison.

Anyone who could sit in the seat of an Evil King was no ordinary figure; their cunning and guile naturally surpassed that of common folk. Only this Heaven-Dominating Force King, besides his brute might, was utterly straightforward with no scheming at all.

At this point, he stubbornly believed that Evil Lord Yang Bai was still scheming, preparing to completely obliterate Zhongdu.

Neither the Evil Kings nor the Eight Great Families knew where Yang Bai was hiding at this moment.

Many sought to find a trace of Yang Bai, but none succeeded. The containment runes set by Transcendent Realm Experts of the Third Stage were impenetrable.

This led many to believe at one point that Yang Bai had sensed danger and fled.

However, Yang Kai felt a faint but ominous sense deep within, as if some great event was about to occur.

He had no time to continue absorbing the divine sense energy dissipated from the dying Divine Roaming Realm experts. Instead, he quickly sought out the elder family heads of the Eight Great Families.

After the fierce battle, these elder family heads were all recuperating, meditating, preparing for the next round of combat to decisively crush the Cangyun Evil Land. When Yang Kai arrived, they were nearly done preparing.

“Uncle,” Yang Kai said as he went straight to Yang Yinghao’s side, his expression grave. “Do you know why Yang Bai is launching such a massive assault on Zhongdu? What is his true purpose?”

Yang Yinghao was momentarily taken aback, then replied, “What do you mean?”

Yang Kai took a breath and said, “It seems, at first glance, that the reason is revenge for the Eight Great Families' previous siege of the Cangyun Evil Land. Yang Bai and the Six Great Evil Kings bear a grudge and are retaliating. That reasoning holds water — after all, for so many years, the Eight Great Families and Cangyun Evil Land have been irreconcilable enemies. But I feel Yang Bai would not recklessly attack Zhongdu just because of that. He must know that success comes at a great cost. If it is not out of boredom, then the Eight Great Families must have something that has caught his eye.”

Hearing this, the elder family heads fell into contemplation, exchanging glances. Ye Kuangren said, “If he has his eyes on something, it’s probably secrets of your Yang Family.”

“Indeed, though our Eight Great Families have considerable foundation, there’s nothing else that would draw Yang Bai’s attention.”

Yang Kai frowned, understanding they referred to the secrets within the Divine Root Hall.

If what Yang Bai coveted was the Divine Root Hall’s secrets, it would be somewhat understandable. Yet soon Yang Kai shook his head. “No, if it were the Yang Family’s secret, he wouldn’t invade from the north side but attack directly from the south!”

The fighting strength that the Cangyun Evil Land displayed earlier was nearly unstoppable. Whichever side he attacked, the families there could not withstand it.

If Yang Bai set his sights on the Yang Family’s Divine Root Hall, he would never come from the north.

Moreover, only the Yang Family’s successive family heads and some Transcendent Realm powerhouses nearing death knew the secrets of the Divine Root Hall. Where could Yang Bai have learned this information?

“Think carefully. Perhaps each of your families has something extraordinary that has caught his attention,” Yang Kai said, scanning the eight elder family heads.

They all looked serious but none could offer any leads.

Given the situation had deteriorated to this point, if any family held something worthy of Yang Bai’s pursuit, they would no longer hide it. Observing their reactions, Yang Kai felt a twinge of disappointment.

Was his guess wrong? What then was Yang Bai’s true purpose in invading Zhongdu?

At that moment, Yang Bai’s aura suddenly appeared from the void.

Everyone stiffened and looked up to see Yang Bai silently hovering midair, coldly watching over the entire Zhongdu. Booming laughter thundered from his mouth.

Involuntarily, all ceased their actions. Following the sound, they gazed at him.

“The time has come!” Yang Bai suddenly withdrew his smile and spoke softly.

A chill ran through Yang Kai’s heart. He did not know what time Yang Bai referred to, but since he dared to show himself, it meant his plan was already in motion.

“The Eight Great Families... laughable. Mere ants, yet they dare to call themselves that. Nephew, though you are impressive, your vision is shortsighted. Today, let your Senior Uncle teach you there is a sky above the sky. This world is not what you think it is. There is much you do not understand. But no matter what, I thank you. Without your sudden rise, more would not have died in today’s battle. If no one died, Senior Uncle would be quite troubled.”

Yang Bai spoke leisurely, floating high with the arrogance of one who holds the world beneath his feet, utterly disdainful.

Yang Kai’s expression moved with surprise as he listened carefully. In Yang Bai’s words, he detected unusual information.

Yang Bai knew secrets beyond this world?

Before he could ponder further, Yang Bai shouted angrily, “Guardians, my Evil Kings!”

The Heaven-Dominating Force King shot toward Yang Bai without hesitation.

The Poison King, Ghost King, and Shadow King hesitated, unsure whether to act.

Yang Bai glanced at them coolly, then chuckled. “What, dare you disobey my orders?”

The Poison King grinned darkly, speaking, “Lord, I only ask: since yesterday’s battle, why have you not intervened? The Sacred Land has suffered heavy casualties.”

“Because I want them to die! If no one dies, how else can I fulfill my goals?” Yang Bai answered casually.

“I see.” The Poison King nodded, then suddenly cupped his fists. “Lord, take care. We will no longer fool around.”

They had followed Yang Bai to attack Zhongdu, hoping to replace it. Seeing that hope vanish and Yang Bai as heartless as ever, these Evil Kings were unwilling to stay.

They were selfish, treacherous people; loyalty and honor meant nothing to them.

With that, the Poison King, Ghost King, Shadow King, and Beast King moved to depart. Yang Bai did not care about the casualties of his subordinates, and naturally, they cared only about their own survival.

Yang Bai sneered, “None of you will leave! Guardians!”

At his words, the four Evil Kings freezing in place showed signs of severe anguish, as if resisting some power. Soon their expressions eased, and they scurried to surround Yang Bai tightly, guarding him closely.

The Eight Great Families’ strong cultivators all changed color.

Though unclear what had transpired with the four Evil Kings, all could see Yang Bai had used a tyrannical method to control them.

Finally taking action, Yang Bai waved his hand, and wondrous energies shot down from the sky, covering the entire Zhongdu.

“Stop him!” Yang Kai roared. Regardless of Yang Bai’s purpose, his actions must be halted.

At his command, all Transcendent Realm cultivators still able to fight surged upward, directly targeting Yang Bai and the Six Great Evil Kings.

“Too late!” Yang Bai laughed. “Since I’ve appeared, everything you do is futile.”

As he spoke, all the blood from the dead bodies and from the ground flowed back into the earth.

A mysterious and murky energy like wriggling earthworms wove through the underground, searching.

Suddenly, Yang Bai’s eyes brightened. Fixing his gaze on a certain location, he waved his hand.

The blood that had seeped underground gathered there.

An overwhelming bloody aura spread forth.

Di Mo, standing alongside Yang Kai, looked serious and said gravely, “Young Master, this appears to be a blood sacrifice method.”

Di Mo, skilled in blood rites as well, recognized some aspects — though his own method was different. Both required corpses and blood.

Countless had died in these days in Cangyun Evil Land and Zhongdu, their blood forming rivers. Yang Bai’s blood sacrifice was a monumental act; compared to Di Mo’s Demonic Shadow Sacred Art, it was incomparable.

Violent sounds erupted from deep underground, shaking all of Zhongdu.

Everyone’s faces turned pale.

Suddenly, Yang Yinghao seemed to recall something and exclaimed, “This is bad! Could Yang Bai be after something beneath the earth?”

“What could be under there?” Yang Kai hurriedly asked.

Yang Yinghao answered, “This is recorded in the Eight Great Families’ texts but never verified. It is said that beneath Zhongdu lies a vast Earth Vein. It is because of this Earth Vein’s presence that the Eight Great Families have made their roots here. Not only the Yang Family but the other seven families also have records of it.”

Qiu Shoucheng nodded in agreement, “Indeed, I have seen it in the family records.”

“But it’s said that a generation sought this Earth Vein for countless years but ultimately failed. Could it really exist, yet have eluded us all this time?” Meng Xiping’s expression darkened.

Though the Eight Great Families had been stationed in Zhongdu for many years and recorded the Earth Vein, they never found it. Yet Yang Bai had now accurately located it, leaving him feeling embarrassed.

“Earth Vein?” Yang Kai said solemnly.

He had seen Earth Veins before and even absorbed their energy.

Long ago on the Hidden Island abroad, there was an almost dried-up Earth Vein, the remaining energy of which he absorbed entirely, greatly increasing his strength.

If one could find such a huge and intact Earth Vein beneath Zhongdu, anyone entering it would reap unimaginable benefits.

“Most likely, this is his goal,” Yang Kai said quietly.

Yang Bai is a Third Stage Transcendent, having reached his limit. To further increase his power, he must seek outside help, and the vast energy of an Earth Vein would be his best choice.

Though only speculation, it was probably close to the truth.
