## Chapter 308 â€” Five-Day Deadline

In the blink of an eye, everyone was once again bound.

Those giant eight-legged spiders, the size of calves, approached the group with terrifying appearances, tirelessly spitting out webs to wrap them up like zongzi, then slowly dragging them back.

Seeing that their lives were temporarily safe, the terrified crowd couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, utterly confused as to why one spider had gone on a killing spree just moments ago.

Before they could fully relax, that murderous spider walked in front of them, raising a sharp front leg high and stabbing down fiercely.

Puff...

Blood splattered, and a scream echoed as Gu Yuanming's body was pierced through, writhing and struggling, his cries continuous. The spider paid him no further mind, allowing him to be dragged away by other spiders, quickly leaving a trail of bright red blood on the ground.

Not only him, but all the martial artists from Cangyun Evil Land were also stabbed by this spider, creating large holes in their bodies. A few unfortunate souls died on the spot, while those who survived turned pale with fright.

The screams were relentless, and the ground was marked with one bloody imprint after another, a sight that was shocking.

Qiu Yimeng's beautiful eyes were filled with horror, her expression one of extreme fear. When she heard Gu Yuanming call out earlier, she nearly couldn't help but rush out.

If she had truly rushed out, she would likely have met the same fate as them.

Fortunately, before leaving, she glanced at Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo, noticing they remained still. Qiu Yimeng gritted her teeth and chose to stay, deciding to place all her hopes on Shan Qingluo.

Now it seemed she had indeed made the right choice.

The remaining martial artists from Cangyun Evil Land were dragged back, and all the Demonic Beasts surrounded a blood-soaked companion, observing curiously, unsure why it had suddenly turned on these people.

After a while of scrutiny, the Demonic Beasts gradually dispersed.

"Why..." Gu Yuanming clutched his abdomen, no matter how he circulated his cultivation technique, he could not stop the flow of blood. His voice grew weaker, "Why is this happening?"

That beast seemed to specifically target the martial artists of Cangyun Evil Land, while ignoring everyone else, leaving Gu Yuanming utterly perplexed.

"This is retribution. Hahaha!" Yang Kai's wild laughter came from over there.

"Did you do this?" Shan Qingluo looked at Yang Kai in astonishment, her tone filled with disbelief.

Yang Kai had just mentioned wanting to teach them a lesson, and those people had suffered a brutal attack. If this had nothing to do with Yang Kai, Shan Qingluo would never believe it.

Yet, she hadn't seen him do anything; how could he control a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast?

"Feeling good?" Yang Kai chuckled.

Shan Qingluo's captivating phoenix eyes sparkled with a strange light as she gazed deeply at Yang Kai, unblinking. A hint of emotion flashed in her eyes.

Suddenly, she slightly raised her toes and pressed her red lips against him.

"Mmm..." Yang Kai was caught off guard, his arms instinctively tightening around Shan Qingluo. This enchanting woman bent her delicate waist, as if she could meld her entire body into Yang Kai.

Her thin, tender lips were crystal clear. Not only did they look soul-stirring, but tasting them was equally intoxicating.

The fragrant and soft sensation lingered, and Shan Qingluo quickly released him.

With a smile, she looked at Yang Kai and said, "We can't linger too long; if we really... really fall for each other, it won't be good."

Yang Kai's expression turned bitter as he licked his lips and said, "Damn, I knew this enchantress would be insatiable. What a pity for a young and strong guy like me to fall into your hands."

"Stop pretending to be innocent!" Shan Qingluo's tone was filled with playful reproach. "Other men wouldn't even dare to look at me. You've already taken a huge advantage."

"Just to be clear, I won't be responsible for you," Yang Kai said with a serious face.

"What are you two doing?" Qiu Yimeng suddenly asked softly.

"Flirting!" 

"Shameless!" Qiu Yimeng quickly fell silent, her face slightly flushed, thinking no wonder there was a soft panting sound coming from next door.

Time passed, day turned to night...

It had been several days since they were captured by these spiders, and the people trapped in the webs still had no way to escape. Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo remained in each other's embrace. This enchantress, renowned for her beauty, could entice Yang Kai with just a movement, a breath, or a glance. Yet, due to her nature, Yang Kai not only couldn't act recklessly but also couldn't tease her, making the days exceedingly difficult.

Qiu Yimeng remained calm throughout, showing no signs of worry or fear, while Luo Xiaoman cried daily, living in constant fear.

Bai Yunfeng had also awakened; after learning of their current predicament, he remained silent, not revealing what he was thinking.

All the martial artists from Cangyun Evil Land had died, all succumbing to excessive blood loss, their deaths extremely tragic.

One day, while Yang Kai was probing with his Divine Sense, he suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly powerful presence.

The vitality of this presence surpassed that of the Sixth-Tier poisonous spiders, appearing abruptly, as if it had always been there, just now awakening.

Before he could warn Shan Qingluo, a feeling of impending doom descended upon them.

In the depths of their minds, everyone suddenly felt as if a pair of eyes was scrutinizing them from above.

Under the gaze of these eyes, anyone would feel a sense of insignificance and helplessness, as if they could not contend with it at all.

Yang Kai's expression changed drastically, and he involuntarily urged his True Essence.

Shan Qingluo suddenly spoke, "Don't move!"

"Why?" Seeing her expression as if she knew something, Yang Kai asked urgently.

"It's it." Shan Qingluo's beautiful eyes trembled slightly, her expression complex.

"Who?"

"The Spider Mother!" Shan Qingluo replied softly, "A Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast! None of us are its match!"

"Seventh-Tier?" Yang Kai exclaimed.

"Yes." Shan Qingluo nodded gravely, "Otherwise, do you think this group of Demonic Beasts would be living so comfortably? The demon cores of Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts are quite valuable. With so many Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts here, if it weren't for the Spider Mother overseeing them, they would have been cleared out long ago."

With a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast present, even if someone accidentally stepped in here, thinking of targeting the Sixth-Tier Demonic Beasts, they would have to weigh their own strength.

"However, the Spider Mother often lays eggs while in a deep sleep; unless someone attacks here, it won't pay attention to us," Shan Qingluo explained softly. "There is a statue of a spider here; look over there!"

Following her direction, Yang Kai indeed saw a vague statue standing not far away, a massive figure resembling an eight-legged spider.

"The Spider Mother usually resides inside, and what I need to obtain is the venom it secretes! Only women from the Poison Widow lineage can safely enter that statue."

"So, the Spider Mother can sense your bloodline?"

"Yes, it should be like that." Shan Qingluo nodded slightly; this was her first time here, and she wasn't entirely sure of the situation.

"Then you should negotiate with it and see if it can let us go," Yang Kai suggested.

"I'll give it a try!" Shan Qingluo bit her red lip, lacking confidence.

Closing her eyes, she attempted to communicate with the Spider Mother using the method left by her mother.

Moments later, a charming voice suddenly entered everyone's ears, even Yang Kai heard it clearly.

"En? You are a woman of the Poison Widow lineage?"

Yang Kai's expression changed, twisting to look around, but he saw nothing. The voice sounded soft and sweet, like a captivating beauty whispering softly in his ear, making one's heart flutter.

Shan Qingluo quickly reminded, "Don't panic; the Spider Mother is communicating with me using Divine Sense!"

Yang Kai's face showed horror.

A Demonic Beast that could communicate with people using Divine Sense!

This was the first time he had encountered such a thing. Could a Demonic Beast achieve this? At least a Sixth-Tier Demonic Beast couldn't, but this Spider Mother was a Seventh-Tier Demonic Beast; perhaps it truly had this capability.

Shan Qingluo had already responded, "Yes! I am the younger generation who has met the Spider Mother!"

"Who is Han Feiyan to you?" the Spider Mother asked gently.

"She is my mother!" Shan Qingluo replied cautiously, not daring to be careless.

"More than thirty years... has this generation already grown up? But why is your strength so low?"

Shan Qingluo forced a smile, "There were some mishaps; I should be able to recover in a few days."

"En." The Spider Mother responded softly, and after a moment, said, "Since you have found your way here, come and take what you need and leave. After all, your lineage has some connection with me!"

Seeing her so agreeable, Shan Qingluo couldn't help but feel delighted. She quickly said, "Spider Mother, please forgive me; I came here with my companion. Can you allow him to leave with me as well?"

Yang Kai looked at her in surprise, not expecting this woman to be so principled.

"Hmph!" the Spider Mother snorted coldly, "These people have damaged my nest and still wish to leave? Everyone except you must die!"

"Spider Mother, please show mercy..."

"No need for more words!"

Shan Qingluo gritted her teeth, glancing at Yang Kai, a hint of struggle flashing in her expression. However, she quickly became resolute and said loudly, "Please, Spider Mother, I only want to take him with me!"

"Impudent!" The Spider Mother's voice sounded somewhat irritated, causing the eight-legged spiders outside to begin spinning webs, their demeanor unfriendly.

"Fine, I'll give you five days. Think it over carefully. I will awaken again in five days, and if you haven't left by then... hmph, don't expect to leave!" The Spider Mother was unyielding. After speaking, she fell silent.

The oppressive feeling hanging over everyone disappeared, clearly indicating that it had once again fallen into a deep sleep.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman's eyes trembled. The conversation between Shan Qingluo and the Spider Mother had reached their ears, and they were equally shocked, unable to fathom the existence of such a powerful Demonic Beast.

Bai Yunfeng suddenly shouted in despair, "We're going to die in five days?"

Before the Spider Mother appeared, everyone was anxious, but the spiders hadn't harmed them much, leaving some hope. But now, with a five-day deadline looming, who could accept it?
