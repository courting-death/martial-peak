## Chapter 2521 — Small World

The martial artists who had attacked Yang Kai were utterly horrified, their faces ashen. Each of them was quite powerful—otherwise, they wouldn’t have ventured so deep into the Dragonbone Wasteland. Yet, even with the advantage of striking first, they were left reeling by someone else’s counterattack.

Who in the world was this person!

Shocked to their core, they all stared wide-eyed at the wooden boat.

“You’re... Yang Kai!”

One of them, a short and stout man, recognized Yang Kai’s face and immediately cried out in alarm.

The others looked as if they’d seen a ghost in broad daylight, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief.

“Hm?” Yang Kai was taken aback. His gaze shifted from the strange spatial anomaly back to the group below. Frowning, he asked, “You know me?”

These martial artists looked completely unfamiliar—he was certain he’d never met them. So how did they know who he was? Although he was now an Emperor, he wasn’t arrogant enough to think his name had spread all the way to the Eastern Territory.

Realizing he’d spoken out of turn, the short, stout martial artist immediately shut his mouth and refused to say another word. Yet the look he gave Yang Kai was filled with burning hatred, as if they had a deep-seated grudge.

“Senior Brother Yang, these people are all direct disciples of Ju Tianqing from the Brahma Heaven Sacred Land!” Lu Wen suddenly whispered from behind Yang Kai.

In the Eastern Territory, her main responsibility was gathering all kinds of intelligence, so she was quite familiar with these people’s backgrounds and recognized them at a glance.

A sharp light flashed in Yang Kai’s eyes. He nodded and said, “Direct disciples of Ju Tianqing? Good, very good!”

If Ju Tianqing’s direct disciples were here, then Ju Tianqing himself must be nearby. According to the information Jia Si had provided, Ju Tianqing was likely together with Zu Hong.

If he could find those two, Yang Kai felt he’d be able to find Gao Xueting. The thought filled him with hope.

Suddenly, as if something had clicked, he grinned at the group and said, “Did Yin Lesheng tell you who I am?”

Yin Lesheng had suffered greatly in the Shattered Star Sea, but he hadn’t died. He’d made a deal with Yang Kai, signing a Soul Contract. In exchange for information about Xiaoxiao, Yang Kai had brought him out of the Void Rift.

With the Soul Contract in place, even if Yang Kai wanted to kill Yin Lesheng, he was powerless to do so. He could only watch as Yin Lesheng left.

The number of Eastern Territory experts Yang Kai had encountered in the Shattered Star Sea was only a handful.

Yao Si, Red Ghost, and the others wouldn’t bother spreading his image and identity everywhere. Only Yin Lesheng would do something like that.

Yin Lesheng had probably guessed that Yang Kai would come to the Eastern Territory to look for Xiaoxiao, so he’d tipped off the people from Brahma Heaven Sacred Land. That’s why, as soon as Yang Kai showed up, these disciples recognized him.

That guy really was despicable—trying to kill with a borrowed knife!

But he probably never imagined Yang Kai would have already advanced to the Emperor Realm.

Exposed by Yang Kai, the short, stout martial artist no longer denied it. He gritted his teeth and said, “That’s right. Senior Brother Yin from the Netherworld Sect told us about you.”

“And what else did he say?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

The short, stout martial artist growled, “He also said that Chang Hao and Chang Xian, the two Holy Sons, were both killed by you!”

Yang Kai nodded. “So, is Brahma Heaven Sacred Land searching everywhere for me?”

The short, stout martial artist snorted, “The two Holy Sons were the future hope of our Sacred Land, and you killed them both so cruelly. Do you think our Sacred Land would let you off so easily? If you know what’s good for you, come back with us to face the elders and the Saint Lord. Maybe you’ll get a lighter sentence. But if you stubbornly resist, our Brahma Heaven Sacred Land will hunt you to the ends of the earth. No matter where you hide, you won’t escape death.”

Yang Kai replied coolly, “Whether I die or not is something you’ll never see. But whether you die or not is up to me.”

With those words, the faces of the short, stout martial artist and the others changed dramatically. They all glared at Yang Kai in alarm.

But Yang Kai’s gaze swept past them, looking toward a patch of void not far behind them. He asked in a deep voice, “Is Ju Tianqing over there?”

The short, stout martial artist was shocked and shouted, “What are you talking about...?”

His face was a mask of panic, as if he were desperately trying to hide something.

Yang Kai snorted coldly, took a step forward, and stood directly above them. He formed a seal with his hands, and the Laws of Space surged around him.

Instantly, the faces of the short, stout martial artist and the others turned pale. Each of them felt as if a great mountain was pressing down on their heads, making it impossible to breathe. Their blood stopped flowing—they couldn’t even think of resisting.

“Emperor Realm!”

Only now did they realize that Yang Kai was actually an Emperor Realm expert. The short, stout martial artist began to tremble violently, recalling how he’d just boasted so arrogantly in front of an Emperor Realm expert. A chill ran from his head to his toes, and he shivered all over.

No wonder their combined attack had been so easily neutralized by Yang Kai. He’d already advanced to the Emperor Realm. The gap in strength was enormous—how could they possibly be a match?

But... how could a newly advanced Emperor have such overwhelming presence? Even their own master, Ju Tianqing, didn’t give off such a powerful aura.

Was he really stronger than their master? But how could that be? Their master had been an Emperor for many, many years—his foundation was solid, his realm stable. How could a newly advanced martial artist compare?

What on earth was going on?

Just as the short, stout martial artist’s mind was in chaos, a ripple suddenly spread through the void under the influence of Yang Kai’s Laws of Space.

As the ripple spread, a pitch-black passage bizarrely appeared. The passage stretched on endlessly, shrouded in darkness, its destination unknown. At the entrance, an ancient beast hide was imprinted in the void, radiating a strange power. It seemed that only with this beast hide could the Void Passage be fully opened.

It was just like a key.

“That’s...” Lu Wen’s beautiful eyes lit up. Pointing at the beast hide, she said, “That’s the beast hide I found before!”

Yang Kai raised his eyebrows, realizing he’d found the right place.

He hadn’t expected there to be a small world hidden here. And the method to open it was on that beast hide.

“Wait, this beast hide is bigger—twice the size of the one I found.” Lu Wen suddenly frowned.

Yang Kai said calmly, “That’s because you only found half. The other half is here. That’s probably why Elder Gao wanted to find someone to help break the seal—she realized the beast hide was incomplete and wanted to find the other half’s owner.”

As he spoke, a sharp light flashed in his eyes. He looked down at the short, stout martial artist and asked, “Tell me, did your master have the other half of the beast hide?”

The question sounded ordinary, but Yang Kai infused it with Divine Soul power.

He’d seen two Great Emperors battle with their Divine Souls in his own Sea of Consciousness. That experience had taught him a lot, so his control over his Divine Soul was much stronger now. With his powerful Divine Soul, it was easy to extract information from a Dao Origin Realm cultivator.

Sure enough, though a trace of struggle flashed across the short, stout martial artist’s face, he couldn’t resist Yang Kai’s Divine Soul pressure. Like a machine, he answered, “Yes.”

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. “A little over a month ago, did a woman come to your master to cooperate here?”

“Yes!”

“What was your master’s plan?”

“Master went to find Zu Hong, the City Lord of Kunyuan City, who is on good terms with him. They planned to join forces against that woman and seize the hidden treasure here.”

Yang Kai’s expression darkened at those words, a murderous aura surging forth as if a layer of frost had settled over him. He snorted coldly, “What difference is there between joining forces with that woman and joining forces with Zu Hong? Either way, it’s just splitting the spoils fifty-fifty. Why would Ju Tianqing go to such lengths, even risking offending a fellow Emperor Realm expert?”

The short, stout martial artist answered honestly, “Master said... that woman possesses pure yin and is quite powerful. If he could subdue her and refine her pure yin, he could advance to the Second Stage of the Emperor Realm. Female cultivators at the First Stage of the Emperor Realm with pure yin are hard to find. Compared to the treasure, Master is more interested in her.”

“How dare he!” Yang Kai roared, his face twisted with rage.

The short, stout martial artist coughed up a mouthful of blood, finally breaking free from the Divine Soul pressure. Realizing he’d just revealed something terrible, he was utterly terrified.

The other martial artists looked equally grim, but, outmatched, they didn’t dare make a sound.

“Sir, there’s no time to lose. You should go in at once.” Zhang Ruoxi urged anxiously, her beautiful eyes glancing at Ju Tianqing’s disciples. Her tone turned icy: “Leave these people to me.”

Yang Kai nodded and said coldly, “Kill them all.”

Zhang Ruoxi responded in a low voice, “Yes!”

There were five of Ju Tianqing’s disciples, but only two were at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. The short, stout martial artist had also suffered Divine Soul damage from Yang Kai, so he probably couldn’t use even half his strength. Of the remaining three, two were at the Second Stage, and one at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm.

Judging by Zhang Ruoxi’s performance in the Ziyue City arena, dealing with them would take some effort, but it shouldn’t be a problem.

What’s more, Zhang Ruoxi had the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress, an Imperial Treasure for defense, so Yang Kai didn’t worry about her safety.

The little girl wanted to become stronger, and a life-and-death battle was the best foundation.

That’s why Yang Kai couldn’t be bothered to bully the weak. Leaving these people for Zhang Ruoxi to handle would be a great benefit to her growth.

After giving his instructions, Yang Kai stepped forward, arriving in front of the surging void. He pressed his hand lightly on the beast hide. As space power surged, his entire hand disappeared into the darkness, and soon, his whole body was swallowed up.

If it were anyone else, they might not be able to enter the Void Passage. But this place had already been opened before, and some unknown method had been used to hide it. Plus, Yang Kai was extremely proficient in space power, so entering was as easy as walking into his own courtyard.
