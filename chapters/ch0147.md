## Chapter 147 — The True Inheritance Place

“Old servant does not dare!” The Earth Demon submitted, then added, “Young Master, that girl who helped you just now is quite decisive in her actions and ruthless in her strikes.”

“What do you want to say?” 

“I want to say that I quite like this girl. Young Master, could you speak to her and let me teach her for a few years? She will surely become a great help to you in the future!”

“I don’t like her!” Yang Kai coldly replied.

“Yes, yes, everything is up to the Young Master.” The Earth Demon did not dare to refute and could only sigh inwardly, feeling it was a pity.

Nie Yong's death left Hu Mei’er stunned on the spot, while the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion who were healing nearby were equally astonished. They had only heard Yang Kai’s furious roar, followed by Nie Yong’s panicked escape, and then a black spike pursuing him. Just as Nie Yong was engaged in battle with the black spear, Lan Chudie had launched a surprise attack, causing Nie Yong to fall to the ground, unable to rise.

What exactly happened? Everyone was still trying to process the situation.

At that moment, the tortoise-shaped demon beast, which resembled a mountain, suddenly collapsed. The disciples from the three factions who were attacking it could not help but cheer.

Hu Jiao’er’s laughter rang out, “Fang Ziqi, I delivered the final blow!”

Fang Ziqi grumbled, “You cheated; how can that count?”

Hu Jiao’er sneered, “Can’t you take a loss?”

Fang Ziqi was furious, “What do you mean I can’t take a loss? If you hadn’t taken advantage of my distraction to hit a few more times, how could you have won this round? I won’t argue with you!”

“Seems you have no face to argue with me now,” Hu Jiao’er pressed on.

Fang Ziqi’s face flushed with embarrassment at her words, and he impatiently said, “Let’s not get caught up in this; we should take the demon core first!”

As he spoke, Fang Ziqi reached into the tortoise-shaped demon beast’s forehead and, after a short while, pulled out a round, blood-stained, yellow demon core.

Staring at the demon core in his hand, Fang Ziqi’s eyes lit up with excitement, “A demon core from a peak sixth-tier demon beast, tsk tsk, how much is this worth?”

Long Jun glanced at him and said, “Brother Fang doesn’t plan to keep it all for himself, does he?”

The most valuable thing in this tortoise-shaped demon beast was indeed this demon core. Although the shell on its back was also worth a lot and could be used as material for refining, who could take such a large shell away?

All eyes were now on the demon core in Fang Ziqi’s hand. He chuckled and said nonchalantly, “I do want to.”

Long Jun’s expression changed, while Hu Jiao’er looked at him with a smile.

“But I wouldn’t dare!” Fang Ziqi smacked his lips, “If I really took it, could you all let me off?”

Long Jun sneered, “Brother Fang is a wise man.”

“But there’s only one demon core; how do we split it?” Fang Ziqi looked around at everyone. This battle was different from killing the other eight demon beasts; this time, the three factions had worked together, so the spoils naturally belonged to everyone.

Once Fang Ziqi’s words left his mouth, everyone fell silent. One demon core was indeed difficult to divide.

Perhaps the only way was to convert it into cash and then split it into three parts, with each faction taking a share.

Just as Long Jun was about to speak, Fang Ziqi continued, “This time we managed to kill this demon beast thanks to Brother Yang from Lingxiao Pavilion. How about we give this to him?”

Hearing this, Yang Kai, who was standing below, furrowed his brows in surprise and looked at Fang Ziqi.

Long Jun was displeased, “Though he put in great effort, our Blood Battle Gang didn’t sit idle either; our disciples suffered injuries too. Are we to get nothing?”

“If you want the big turtle shell, take it; I have no objections,” Fang Ziqi pointed to the side.

Long Jun rolled his eyes in exasperation. The turtle shell had been attacked by countless disciples from the three factions, and by now, it had no marks left on it. Although the quality was good, who could cut it open and take it away? Was that a joke?

Just as the two were entangled in their argument, Fang Ziqi suddenly changed his expression and quickly threw the demon core in his hand into the air.

Once the yellow demon core flew out, it did not fall to the ground; instead, it began to spin in mid-air.

As it spun, an invisible force radiated outward from all directions, and a strange scene unfolded. Two other demon cores, which had been hidden in Fang Ziqi’s arms, suddenly flew out.

The same happened for Hu Mei’er and Long Jun.

The demon core hidden in Jie Hongchen’s chest also flew out.

These demon cores were all obtained from the eight demon beasts that their three factions had previously slain, and they had been kept by these few people. Now, not a single one was left behind; they all flew out.

Eight demon cores, arranged in a mysterious formation, gathered around the tortoise-shaped demon beast's core, all spinning in unison. It seemed as if some magical force was pulling them together, causing the entire Inheritance Celestial Cave to tremble. The chaotic sky revealed an enormous vortex, presenting a scene akin to the end of the world, striking fear into everyone’s hearts.

No one knew what was happening, except for the Earth Demon, whose excited voice echoed in Yang Kai’s mind: “Beast Soul Opening Cloud Formation!”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted, realizing that the Earth Demon must know something. He quickly asked, “Explain in detail.”

The Earth Demon replied, “Young Master, I understand now. It turns out there were nine demon beasts here to set up this formation. The existence of these nine demon beasts was merely a test of the strength of those who entered here. If you did not kill these demon beasts, the formation would not be triggered. Now that the demon beasts are dead, the formation has been activated. This formation will use those nine demon cores as a guide to operate, revealing certain things before you.”

“What things?”

“The things hidden in the clouds!” the Earth Demon said solemnly. “If I’m not mistaken, that is the true inheritance here!”

“True inheritance?” Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat as he looked up at the sky. He saw the vortex growing larger and larger, the chaotic scene hinting at a power that could swallow the heavens and devour the earth, terrifying beyond measure.

At this moment, the disciples from the three factions were already in a panic, with no one remaining below.

“Indeed,” the Earth Demon affirmed. “A great battle once occurred here, with countless experts dying, naturally leaving behind many inheritances. But this place always has an owner, and what is hidden in those clouds is the true inheritance of this owner.”

Yang Kai’s heart ignited with excitement.

“Quickly leave, Young Master! Once this formation is triggered, it will be overwhelming. If you don’t leave, you might be affected,” the Earth Demon’s voice turned anxious.

Upon hearing this, Yang Kai did not hesitate and quickly told Hu Mei’er, who was standing beside him, “Tell your sister to take everyone away.”

“Oh.” Hu Mei’er nodded and dashed toward Hu Jiao’er.

Only then did Yang Kai call out loudly to the disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, “Those who don’t want to die, retreat ten miles!”

Many people heard his words but did not pay much attention.

Yang Kai couldn’t be bothered with them; he had already reminded them, and whether they listened was their own choice. After speaking, he turned and ran back.

Su Yan glanced at him and, without a hint of hesitation, said, “All disciples of Lingxiao Pavilion, retreat ten miles!”

With the command of the Senior Sister, everyone quickly began to move, retreating in the direction Yang Kai had indicated.

On the other side, after receiving her sister’s message, Hu Jiao’er also unhesitatingly issued the order to retreat.

Fang Ziqi watched this scene, sizing up Yang Kai deeply before laughing, “Let’s go too!”

The disciples from the three factions rushed away like the wind, quickly reaching ten miles away.

Looking back, the nine demon cores were now radiating dazzling light, and it seemed there was an invisible connection between the cores. As they spun, the vortex in the sky grew larger.

A tremendous force emanated from the vortex, pulling the corpse of the tortoise-shaped demon beast upward into the sky, vanishing into the vortex without leaving a trace.

Seeing this scene, everyone’s expressions changed dramatically.

If they hadn’t just retreated ten miles, they would likely have ended up like the corpse of that tortoise-shaped demon beast, sucked into the vortex.

Feeling relieved, many turned to look at Yang Kai, secretly admiring his foresight.

The howling wind whipped around them, causing everyone’s clothes to flutter wildly, and many were so frightened that their faces turned pale. Those who could enter this place were all young disciples, not very experienced; many had never even traveled far, let alone witnessed such a terrifying scene.

“Do we need to retreat further?” Su Yan suddenly appeared beside Yang Kai and asked lightly.

Yang Kai glanced at her and slowly shook his head. Hearing this, Su Yan’s worries eased considerably.

“I will personally report Nie Yong’s matter to the Elder Council; you don’t need to worry.”

“En.” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Although the time Yang Kai had taken to kill Nie Yong was brief, it had caught Su Yan’s attention. She was meticulous and could understand the key points without needing further explanation, so there was no need to ask more.

“There’s something in the clouds!” Suddenly, a cry of surprise rang out.

Yang Kai quickly looked up and saw a golden light slowly emerging from the enormous vortex in the sky. The golden light was dazzling and brilliant, as if a hand had pushed aside the clouds, revealing what was hidden within the vortex to everyone.

“What is that?” someone shouted.

Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed, fixating on the sky.

He saw a corner, resembling the corner of a house, and then that corner gradually descended.

Yang Kai soon realized that it was not a corner of a house, but a staircase, a golden staircase.

This staircase extended for over ten miles, and as it descended, another layer of stairs appeared in everyone’s view, followed by another…

It descended very slowly, and as it did, the chaotic vortex in the sky shifted and changed.

After a moment, barely a dozen layers of stairs emerged from the vortex, but how many more layers remained hidden was unknown.

“Earth Demon, is this the inheritance you spoke of?” Yang Kai asked in his mind.

“Young Master, you may not know this, but this should be the place of inheritance. Only those who pass the final test can truly obtain the inheritance. Please look at those stairs; if I’m not mistaken, there are at least ten thousand layers. Only after climbing ten thousand layers can one pass the final test. Of course, this estimate is just my own; it may not be that many, but it could also be more.”

Yang Kai nodded slightly. Although the place of inheritance had revealed itself, it was uncertain how long it would take to reach the ground. There was no need to focus on it now.

However, his current strength was still too low; among the three factions’ disciples, he could hardly rank. With seven or eight hundred people gathered here, did he have a chance?
