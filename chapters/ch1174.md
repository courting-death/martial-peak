## Chapter 1174 — Chang Qi and Hao An

Having spent more time with Yang Kai, Chang Qi recovered his composure more quickly. Smiling faintly, he asked, “You must have some questions, don’t you?”

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded slightly. "Why did the two of you from the Haike Family come?"

Precisely because there were many things he didn't understand, Yang Kai had brought the two of them over to ask about the situation.

Entering the Flowing Flame Sandland was an opportunity that had appeared only once in nearly four hundred years. The Haike Family was a minor house, at most entitled to two or three quotas; such a chance ought to be accompanied by an elder or even the Family Head personally. In any case, it shouldn't have fallen to two outsiders serving as Guest Elders like Chang Qi and Hao An.

Chang Qi sighed, "No one else wanted to go! Otherwise why would it fall to the two of us old fellows?"

"Why would no one want to go?" Yang Kai blinked in surprise.

Hao An smiled and explained, "After what happened last time, the Haike Family has fallen out of favor with Yingyue Hall. From the Family Head down to ordinary disciples, everyone lives in fear; many Guest Elders have already left the Haike Family, leaving only me and Old Chang. The elders are all in seclusion and won't risk going out to see people."

"Afraid of me?" Yang Kai suddenly began to understand.

"More or less." Chang Qi nodded. "Of course they're afraid you'll come back to settle scores. The Haike Family has given up a great deal of its assets. Ian is consolidating the family's strength, calling all disciples home to seclude and cultivate. With Yingyue Hall treating the family coldly, life for them has grown harder. Now in the whole Haike Family, aside from me and Brother Hao, no one is willing or dares to go out."

Yang Kai laughed in astonishment.

He hadn't expected the Haike Family Head Ian to be so cautious.

Even if Ian had caused trouble for him before, for Wu Yi's sake Yang Kai had long since let it go. He had no intention of seeking vengeance against the Haike Family. Who knew they treated life like walking on thin ice, constantly trembling.

Still, they deserved it; Yang Kai wouldn't trouble them, but he wouldn't pity them either.

"Elder Qian is kind — he still allocated our Haike Family two spots to enter the Flowing Flame Sandland, so Brother Hao and I hurried here," Chang Qi continued. "If Brother Hao and I don't break through soon, we won't have many years left. We only hope to find a chance to advance in the Flowing Flame Sandland, and maybe fulfill the agreement with the Family Head."

"Agreement?" Yang Kai frowned.

"Yes. The Family Head's meaning was that the whole family is in seclusion and no longer needs Guest Elders. If we turn over half of the gains we obtain in the Flowing Flame Sandland, we can sever ties with the Haike Family and seek our own way."

Yang Kai's expression chilled. "Is he bullying honest men?"

The other Guest Elders left without Ian setting any conditions, yet it fell to Chang Qi and Hao An to surrender half of whatever they earned in the Flowing Flame Sandland — Ian certainly knew how to balance his books.

He didn't need his own family members to take the risk, and might still acquire some decent material gains; what else could this be if not bullying honest men?

At that moment, Yang Kai's contempt for Ian deepened.

Chang Qi and Hao An were odd too — why had they stayed when the other Guest Elders left? And why accept such unreasonable terms from Ian?

Perhaps sensing Yang Kai's doubt, Chang Qi explained with some melancholy, "Brother Hao and I have served the family for years and received many benefits. To just walk away like that would weigh on our conscience, so the two of us agreed to the Family Head's request."

Yang Kai shook his head slowly; though he couldn't approve of their choice, he greatly respected the loyalty and righteousness that kept them bound to the family — without that, they wouldn't have accepted such terms.

A thought flickered through Yang Kai's mind and he asked, "If both of you return safely from the Flowing Flame Sandland, do you have anywhere to go?"

Chang Qi and Hao An exchanged a glance and both shook their heads slowly, "We've spent most of our lives in the Haike Family; without the family we really don't know where to go. Third Stage of the Saint King Realm — it's not low, but it's not high either. The key is our age; few places would accept us."

They had no children, so they had nowhere to turn.

Yang Kai smiled, "If you don't mind, how about settling at Dragon Lair Mountain? Wu Yi and Yu Feng often mention you; there are many disciples there who originally belonged to the Haike Family. If the two of you go to help govern them, those youngsters should behave."

Chang Qi and Hao An brightened; the former could hardly believe it and exclaimed, "We can go?"

"Of course — it's not a forbidden place. We, as juniors, would welcome you," Yang Kai laughed heartily.

The two Guest Elders flushed with excitement; their beards trembled and Chang Qi stammered, "This... how can we accept such kindness?"

It was clear he was tempted to go. Dragon Lair Mountain was no longer as it had been; mist wreathed the peaks, Spiritual Qi surged, and it could serve as a proper base for founding a sect. Over time the Spiritual Qi there would only grow richer.

"No need to be bashful; we're not strangers. If you go, you can also take time to guide those disciples in cultivation."

The two Guest Elders rose in unison, bowed to the ground, and said together, "In that case, we gratefully accept."

Chang Qi added, "If we return safely this time, we'll sell our old lives to this young brother."

"Don't speak so seriously; your lives are far more important than anything," Yang Kai urged, seating them and then asking, "Have you prepared anything for entering the Flowing Flame Sandland?"

"We did make some preparations, though I don't know if they'll help," Hao An sighed. "Brother Chang and I spent our life's savings to purchase one Saint King-Grade Upper-Level ice defensive secret treasure apiece, plus some healing pills; beyond that we couldn't prepare much."

That's where people differ: a single Saint King-Grade Upper-Level secret treasure could cost thirty to forty thousand Saint Crystals. Even at this special time, an ice defensive secret treasure is pricey — at most fifty or sixty thousand.

And yet the two Guest Elders had spent their life savings.

Those Saint Crystals meant nothing to Yang Kai.

After a moment's thought Yang Kai produced eight jade vials from his Spatial Ring and handed them over, four to each, explaining, "One vial is for healing, two for restoring Saint Yuan, and one to resist heat. Keep them safe."

The pill for resisting heat was the Ice-Snow Pill; Yang Kai had only refined two vials in total and now gave them both away.

The two almost refused, but Yang Kai added, "I have plenty of these; don't refuse."

Chang Qi and Hao An exchanged a look, tears of gratitude welling in their old eyes as they silently accepted the four vials.

In that moment their emotions were stirred: they had served the Haike Family most of their lives, and now Ian wanted to drive them out and set such conditions, yet Yang Kai without a second thought handed over eight vials between them.

The contrast was as wide as heaven and earth.

Chang Qi and Hao An suddenly felt that leaving the Haike Family and staying with Yang Kai might not be a bad thing at all; the sorrow and loneliness of recent days vanished.

"Take these Saint Crystals as well," Yang Kai produced a ring and passed it to them. "I heard that in the Heat-Flame Zone one cannot operate their cultivation to absorb Spiritual Qi; that Qi contains a kind of fire poison that is dangerous to anyone who absorbs it. Recovery must rely on Saint Crystals and pills."

This time they did not refuse; Chang Qi gratefully took the ring, swept his Divine Sense inside, and immediately changed color, exclaiming, "This is far too much."

The Spatial Ring Yang Kai gave them was the one Yin Jianzhong had handed over to him the day before — inside lay no less than five hundred thousand Saint Crystals!

Chang Qi had never seen so many Saint Crystals in his life and nearly dropped the ring in shock.

Yang Kai waved a hand, "I have more Saint Crystals. Keep these for now; if you don't use them all, take them back. Consider it a deposit for inviting the two of you to settle at Dragon Lair Mountain."

An idea flashed through Yang Kai's mind: Dragon Lair Mountain had Qian Tong looking after it and Yang Flame arranging protective formations, making it extremely safe, but its manpower was a weak point.

Among everyone there, aside from Yang Kai himself, few were battle-proven. Wu Yi and Yu Feng, both First Stage of the Saint King Realm, had decent aptitude but needed time to grow.

Chang Qi and Hao An were Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; if they could reach the Origin Returning Realm, Dragon Lair Mountain's defenses would be strengthened.

Origin Returning cultivators can employ Shi, a power that even gave Yang Kai headaches.

Recruiting them was partly because Wu Yi had a good relationship with them and they were supremely loyal, and partly because Yang Kai wanted to add some powerful cultivators to Dragon Lair Mountain.

The two Guest Elders had been stuck at Third Stage of the Saint King Realm for years due to their aptitude; a single Origin Condensing Pill would let them break through that bottleneck.

But the Cui Luo Grass needed to refine an Origin Condensing Pill seemed rare; Yang Kai had only ever had two stalks and had already used them.

It looked like on this trip into the Flowing Flame Sandland they'd need to search the heavenly-treasure region for Cui Luo Grass — if they found some, all the better; if not, they could always buy it. In any case, Yang Kai was not short on Saint Crystals.

After much persuasion, Chang Qi and Hao An finally accepted the ring.

Yang Kai then began to tell them everything he had heard from Wei Guchang about the Flowing Flame Sandland.

While Chang Qi and Hao An had also obtained some information, it wasn't as complete as what Yang Kai had learned; they listened intently, not daring to miss a single detail.
