## Chapter 2112 — Inquiry

"We'll talk about it when the time comes." Yang Kai stood up, looking down at her from above. The corner of his mouth lifted, and he suddenly smiled, stroking his chin as he said, "Actually, if you want to regain your freedom, it's quite simple."

"What do you mean?" Hua Qingsi shivered, looking at Yang Kai with caution. "What are you trying to do?"

Yang Kai snorted, "Relax, I'm not that interested in you. But if you truly want your freedom, just obediently hand over your Soul Brand to me. Maybe I'll consider it. The strength of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm is still pretty decent for me right now..."

"Keep dreaming!" Hua Qingsi gritted her teeth, not even letting Yang Kai finish his sentence.

"Well then... goodbye!" Yang Kai waved at her and left the Small Xuan Realm directly.

Only Hua Qingsi was left, stunned and lost. After a long while, she cried out in grief, "Come back, come back, come back..."

...

Inside the side room, Yang Kai reappeared. After a brief thought, he turned into a streak of light and shot out of the Zhang Family's old residence, heading toward Fenglin City.

Moments later, he arrived at Fenglin City.

He didn't go looking for Mo Xiaoqi or Kang Siran; he went straight to the Qin Family residence.

Yang Kai had been to the Qin Family once before, so he was quite familiar with the route. With just a sweep of his Divine Sense, he detected Qin Yu's location.

He didn't bother to hide his presence—he swaggered straight over. He arrived at a side room and gently knocked on the window.

"Who?" a low voice called from inside.

Yang Kai answered.

The room was silent for a moment, but soon, he heard light footsteps approaching the window, which was then opened.

Qin Yu looked at Yang Kai in surprise and confusion. "Yang... Lord Yang? It's so late, what brings you here?"

"Mm, I have a few things to ask you." Yang Kai answered, poking his head inside. "May I come in and talk?"

Qin Yu blushed. "Please come in, Lord."

As soon as she finished speaking, Yang Kai slipped in through the window.

Qin Yu's face turned even redder.

It was nighttime, and Yang Kai had chosen not to enter through the main door but had slipped in through the window. If someone who didn't know the truth saw this, they might misunderstand.

But Qin Yu trusted Yang Kai. With his strength, if he truly had any intentions toward her, he could act without anyone knowing—there was no need to expose himself.

The room was fragrant and pleasantly arranged, warm and elegant.

This was likely Qin Yu's boudoir.

Yang Kai knew his visit was a bit abrupt, but he didn't mind too much.

After sitting down, Qin Yu offered him tea and asked, "I wonder what Lord wishes to ask me?"

Yang Kai picked up the teacup and took a sip. "Miss Qin, you are beautiful and wise, exceptionally clever. In terms of knowledge, you are the most learned I've ever met. I came here today mainly to ask you to clear up some doubts for me!"

Qin Yu smiled lightly. "Lord flatters me. I'm just a woman who has read a few more books. If there's anything I can help with, please say so, no need to be polite."

Yang Kai grinned. "Then I'll get straight to the point. Mm, but I hope today's conversation..."

"I swear on my soul I will never reveal it to a third person!" Qin Yu said solemnly.

Yang Kai glanced at her, thinking how easy it was to talk to smart people. Only then did he say, "Earlier outside the city, I was invaded by Demonic Qi and nearly became a demon. I suppose you saw it yourself."

Qin Yu's beautiful eyes flashed with lingering fear, and she nodded gently. "Mm, fortunately, fate favored you and you turned danger into safety."

"While I was being invaded by Demonic Qi and turning into a demon, many strange images appeared in my mind," Yang Kai said casually.

Qin Yu exclaimed, "Many strange images?"

"That's right." Yang Kai nodded. "When we used a secret technique to peer into Jiang Chuhe's Sea of Consciousness, we saw the Ancient Giant Demon. So I suspect that some remnant will of the Ancient Giant Demon exists within the Demonic Qi, retaining much of the demon's knowledge and experience. After being invaded, one might get a glimpse of these things."

"Lord, that makes sense. I thought the same." Qin Yu looked delighted to find a kindred spirit.

"But what I saw was different from what Jiang Chuhe saw. The images were fragmented, but there was no sign of the Ancient Giant Demon."

"Oh? What kind of images?" Qin Yu grew interested.

Yang Kai appeared thoughtful, his voice low. "There were too many images, but I only saw two clearly. The first was a seed—half gold, half silver. After planting it, through spring and autumn, cold and heat, it grew into a strange tree with gold and silver colors, entwined with gold and silver divine light, alternating and overlapping, as if possessing immense power!"

"A gold and silver strange tree?" Qin Yu exclaimed in surprise, covering her mouth.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded seriously, looking at her. "Miss Qin, do you know what this gold and silver strange tree is?"

"I seem to recall reading about such a tree somewhere..." Qin Yu frowned, trying hard to remember.

Yang Kai's expression grew expectant as he looked at her.

But after a long while, Qin Yu couldn't give a definite answer. She kept shaking her head. "Sorry, Lord, I've seen a record like that, but I can't recall it right now. Give me a few days to check the books I've read before; I should be able to find something."

"That's fine, no rush. I'm just curious what it is." Yang Kai chuckled. Though a bit disappointed, he didn't show it.

"What about the second image you saw?" Qin Yu asked.

"A token, palm-sized, made of strange material—not gold or wood. On the front was the character for 'dragon,' seemingly written in ancient script. On the back was a true dragon soaring through the skies!"

"Dragon Isle Token!" This time, as soon as Yang Kai finished describing it, Qin Yu gave the answer.

"Is it really the Dragon Isle Token?" Yang Kai was delighted.

Although Hua Qingsi had also told him it might be a Dragon Isle Token, he hadn't fully trusted her. Besides, Hua Qingsi herself couldn't be sure.

But now that Qin Yu said so, it was very likely true.

"If your description is correct, then it's definitely the Dragon Isle Token." Qin Yu was so excited her face flushed. "Since ancient times, only five Dragon Isle Tokens have ever existed. Three have already been used, so only two remain in the world..."

What she said basically matched what Hua Qingsi had told Yang Kai before, including the number of Dragon Isle Tokens and the times and places they were used.

Clearly, Hua Qingsi hadn't lied to Yang Kai about this matter.

"But..." Qin Yu's expression grew puzzled. "How could the remnant will of the Ancient Giant Demon contain the Dragon Isle Token?"

"Why couldn't it?" Yang Kai countered.

"Because the timing doesn't match. When the Ancient Giant Demon was sealed, the Dragon Isle Tokens shouldn't have existed yet... How could the demon know about it?"

Qin Yu looked completely baffled.

Yang Kai realized something was wrong. He'd only wanted to ask Qin Yu about things he didn't understand, but hadn't expected her to be so sharp, immediately spotting a glaring flaw.

"I don't know either. Maybe the demon could sense the Dragon Isle Token was a threat to him," Yang Kai said, laughing it off.

"That's possible." Qin Yu didn't dwell on it. After all, it was too long ago to verify.

"Alright, that's all I came to ask. It's late, you should rest. I'll take my leave." As he spoke, Yang Kai stood up.

Qin Yu rose to see him off. "I'll investigate the gold and silver strange tree as soon as possible. If I find anything, I'll let you know right away."

"Good!" Yang Kai nodded, then left through the main door, his figure vanishing in a flash.

Moments later, Qin Chaoyang suddenly appeared at Qin Yu's door, staring at Yang Kai's departing figure with a strange look. "Yu'er, what did Brother Yang come to see you about?"

"He asked me some things," Qin Yu replied.

"What things?" Qin Chaoyang looked surprised.

Qin Yu stuck out her tongue. "Secret!"

Qin Chaoyang was taken aback, then shook his head with a wry smile. "You little girl, not even telling your ancestor the truth now, huh?"

Qin Yu said helplessly, "It's not that I won't say, but I can't. However, I can tell you, Patriarch, that what Lord Yang asked has nothing to do with Fenglin City or our Qin Family!"

Qin Chaoyang understood and nodded. "That's good!"

After a moment of silence, he sighed and looked at Qin Yu. "How is your health?"

"Still alright!" Qin Yu replied.

"Nonsense!" Qin Chaoyang's face turned stern. "Don't think I don't know. Last time, to repair the seal, you spent a huge amount of energy. With your condition, you can't hold on much longer."

Qin Yu fell silent.

Qin Chaoyang sighed, "With your aptitude, if not for that constitution, you might still have had a chance to revive the Qin Family’s ancestral glory. But… it is bitterly frustrating. This old man's strength is too meager—no matter what I try, I can only extend your life, not heal the root. As your Patriarch, I am ashamed."

Qin Yu's eyes reddened, and she said softly, "Don't say that, Patriarch. If not for you, I would have died three years ago. Living three more years has made me very happy. My only regret is not being able to serve you longer, and making you worry!"

"Don't worry, Patriarch will find a way for you. I won't let you die young!" Qin Chaoyang said firmly.

After speaking, he too vanished.

Qin Yu opened her mouth, as if wanting to say something, but Qin Chaoyang was already gone.

She thought for a moment and seemed to understand what Qin Chaoyang was planning, her pretty face changing dramatically.
