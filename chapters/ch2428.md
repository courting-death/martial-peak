## Chapter 2428 — One-on-One

Upon hearing this, Zi Yu also nodded and said, "Ancestor, I am not afraid of him! He is nothing but a fancy pillow, with no real skills to speak of."

Before Bing Yun could reply, Yang Kai burst out laughing and said, "Junior Sister, I appreciate your concern. Since he’s just a fancy pillow, I have even less reason to fear him. Just watch as your Senior Brother goes over there and beats him so badly even his own mother won’t recognize him!"

Zi Yu found his words amusing and couldn’t help but let out a giggle.

Bing Yun said, "Don’t underestimate your opponent. I know a bit about your abilities, and Feng Xi can’t possibly be your match. But I remember that when Feng Xuan advanced to the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm back then, just like me, he also refined an Emperor Extinction Pill. If that Emperor Extinction Pill is in Feng Xi’s hands, you must finish this quickly and not give him the slightest chance."

Hearing this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but furrow his brows.

No matter how great Feng Xi’s abilities were, he wasn’t afraid, but he had to be wary of the Emperor Extinction Pill. He himself had used the Emperor Extinction Pill twice, and each time its power was overwhelming. If Feng Xi really used the Emperor Extinction Pill against him, he would definitely not be able to win.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai nodded and said, "I understand."

"But you don’t need to worry too much. If he really uses the Emperor Extinction Pill, I will step in," Bing Yun added.

Yang Kai grinned and said, "With Senior Bing Yun here, this Junior can rest easy."

"Let’s go over. If we keep them waiting too long, who knows what slander they’ll come up with," Bing Yun said, leading the group toward the center of Binglun City.

The commotion here had already alarmed all the cultivators in Binglun City. Although many didn’t understand the details, everyone now knew that Wenqing Sect’s Young Sect Master Feng Xi was about to face off against an unknown young cultivator in the arena.

Nearly all the cultivators in Binglun City surged toward the arena. By the time Yang Kai, Bing Yun, and the others arrived, they saw the place surrounded layer upon layer, packed so tightly that not even a breeze could get through.

The arena itself looked quite grand, apparently set up by Binglun City’s City Lord specifically for cultivators to settle their grievances. On the stage, dozens of restrictions, large and small, were set so those inside could fight freely without worrying about destroying the arena.

The arena covered a vast area, about a hundred zhang across, shaped like an ellipse. Around it, tier upon tier of high platforms had been built for spectators to watch the battle.

At this moment, every seat on those high platforms was packed, and more people kept arriving from all directions to watch the fight.

Feng Xi was already standing at the center of the arena, a faint cold smile on his lips, his expression inscrutable and arrogant beyond compare.

When he saw Yang Kai’s figure, he even gestured at him, then slowly slid his hand across his own neck, making it clear he intended to kill Yang Kai.

"Be careful!" Bing Yun whispered another reminder in Yang Kai’s ear.

Yang Kai nodded slightly, his figure flickering as he leapt onto the arena, standing ten zhang away from Feng Xi, staring at him across the distance.

A commotion rippled through the crowd as many people sized up Yang Kai, pointing and whispering, wondering where this nobody had come from to dare face Wenqing Sect’s Young Master on the arena.

Some busybodies even spread word of what had happened earlier at the inn.

When people learned that Yang Kai had robbed Wenqing Sect’s Sect Master of one billion Middle-Level Source Crystals, and had even snatched the Spatial Rings of both the Vice Sect Master and Young Sect Master the night before, the crowd instantly erupted.

Most of the cultivators living in Binglun City favored Ice Heart Valley, so they didn’t think much of Wenqing Sect. Hearing that the three elders of Wenqing Sect had suffered such a huge loss at Yang Kai’s hands, everyone was thrilled.

The noise and chatter around the arena surged like a tide, reaching Feng Xi’s ears and making his face turn extremely ugly, his emotions inevitably shaken.

On the viewing platform, Feng Xuan, who had been quietly watching, seemed to notice this and shouted coldly, "Xi’er, if you can’t grind this brat’s bones to dust today, you are no longer this sect’s Young Sect Master. If you can do it, I guarantee you can marry Miss Zi Yu!"

Feng Xi’s spirits instantly lifted, his face flushing with excitement as he declared proudly, "Father, rest assured, your son will not disappoint you. I will use this brat’s blood and Divine Soul to wash away our sect’s shame and show him the consequences of offending those he shouldn’t!"

"Very good! Do it, don’t hold back!" Feng Xuan nodded in satisfaction.

On the arena, Feng Xi’s face turned vicious as he glared coldly at Yang Kai and said, "Brat, you heard my father. If you don’t want to suffer for nothing, kneel down and kowtow to apologize now, and I’ll give you a quick death. Otherwise..."

Before he could finish, Yang Kai’s figure suddenly flickered and vanished from where he stood.

Feng Xi was shocked, hastily sending out his Divine Sense to probe the surroundings, but to his surprise, there was no trace of Yang Kai’s aura anywhere. It was as if he had vanished into thin air—Feng Xi hadn’t even seen how he disappeared.

Just as he was growing suspicious, a sense of danger welled up in his heart. Without thinking, he shouted and surged his Origin Qi, instantly forming an oval light barrier around his body, completely enveloping himself in defense.

This was clearly a top-tier defensive Secret Treasure, offering flawless, airtight protection.

He had just activated the power of his defensive Secret Treasure when Yang Kai appeared before him like a ghost, a mocking smile on his face as he threw a punch at Feng Xi.

With that punch, the wind howled and the world trembled.

Feng Xi’s expression changed dramatically.

With a boom, the entire arena seemed to shake.

Feng Xi felt as if a mountain had crashed into him, an unimaginable force slamming into his chest. His qi and blood surged, pain shot through his chest, and he was sent flying backward uncontrollably.

The defensive light barrier of his Secret Treasure caved in under that punch, accompanied by a series of sharp cracking sounds.

Feng Xi’s face changed drastically. Looking up, he saw that his Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure had developed a crack a foot long!

His face turned pale, and he was utterly shocked to his core.

This was a Dao Origin-Grade Upper-Level defensive Secret Treasure. Once activated, even if he stood still and let cultivators of the same level attack, no one could break through its defense in ten breaths.

But what was with this brat? With just one punch, he had cracked his Secret Treasure. If he took another punch, wouldn’t it be destroyed?

On the viewing platform, Feng Xuan suddenly stood up, his eyes wide, his expression changing dramatically.

As a Third Stage Emperor Realm expert, Feng Xuan could tell at a glance that something was wrong when Yang Kai made his move. This brat was clearly not an ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator—Feng Xi was absolutely no match for him.

"Such speed, such strength—is this brat even human?" Hu Yuan also exclaimed in shock.

"The Young Sect Master was sent flying with one punch. Who is this guy, really?"

"Do you think he could really be Bing Yun’s..."

"Are you looking to die? It’s one thing for Lord Feng Xuan to say that, but you dare say it too?"

All the Emperor Realm experts present could see what was happening. Even though it was just the first exchange, in their eyes, Feng Xi was already completely outmatched. In both momentum and strength, Yang Kai had thoroughly suppressed him—victory was only a matter of time.

The people from Ice Heart Valley were also watching in amazement. They had been worried about Yang Kai, unsure what would happen when he took the stage, but now it was clear there was nothing to worry about. With such strength, even Zi Yu couldn’t compare.

The only question was whether he could keep up this level of power, or if that was all he had.

The women quietly glanced at Bing Yun and saw her expression was calm, showing no sign of concern for Yang Kai. Only then did they realize they had been worrying for nothing.

Sun Yunxiu recalled that she had even suggested sending Zi Yu up to replace Yang Kai, and couldn’t help but feel her cheeks flush.

"You dare talk nonsense in a life-and-death battle? Watch as I smash your mouth!" On the arena, Yang Kai pressed his advantage, relentlessly pursuing Feng Xi. Multicolored light blossomed from his fist, the undying sword qi of the five elements swirling and flickering around it.

Unsure whether Feng Xi had the Emperor Extinction Pill, Yang Kai couldn’t afford to hold back. He only thought of ending this quickly, so he didn’t restrain himself at all.

The Undying Five Elements Sword coiled around his fist, the five elements generating and overcoming each other in endless transformations, as Yang Kai struck down again with full force.

With his current strength, he didn’t even need to use a Secret Treasure to deal with cultivators of the same level.

Feng Xi, unsteady on his feet, watched helplessly as Yang Kai’s fist came crashing down, feeling the terrifying power within. His face turned pale. After the previous punch, he had already experienced Yang Kai’s terror—even his defensive Secret Treasure had been cracked. If this punch landed, the treasure would be destroyed, and he would be either dead or gravely injured.

He wanted to use his trump card, but found his qi and blood surging in his chest, unable to muster any more Origin Qi. In panic, he cried out, "Father, save me!"

In less than ten breaths, he had lost all his earlier confidence, now like a stray dog begging its master for help.

On the viewing platform, Feng Xuan must have noticed something was wrong. As soon as Feng Xi cried out, he made his move, reaching out from afar to grab at Yang Kai.

No matter what, he couldn’t let his son be killed by Yang Kai in front of so many people.

Bing Yun sneered, "Feng Xuan, three thousand years and your skin is still as thick as ever. You really have the nerve to interfere in the younger generation’s fight!"

As she spoke, she lightly struck out with her palm, sending it toward Feng Xuan.

"Bing Yun, do you really want to be this Lord’s enemy?" Feng Xuan roared in anger, but had no choice but to defend himself. Bing Yun was his equal in strength—if he didn’t defend, he would be injured, and if he was injured, Wenqing Sect would be in trouble.

The two exchanged blows across the air, the shockwaves sweeping out like a raging storm, making countless people tremble and lose their footing. Some of the weaker ones even fainted on the spot.
