## Chapter 1218 — Unlucky Fate

What put Daiyuan at ease was that, before she even had to beg, Yang Kai had already taken the initiative to return; she let out a quiet breath, thinking that this fellow must be on good terms with Wei Guchang to dare risk so much to save him.

After a round of effort, they at last got the remaining three people ashore.

It was strange — once the lava lake was empty of people, the enormous boiling bubbles that had churned about suddenly subsided; in only a dozen breaths or so, the lava lake that had trapped Wei Guchang and the others for a whole month strangely vanished from their sight.

All that remained was a turtle shell split with many cracks and baked a deep red, and the dark-red earth everywhere, as if all the prior ordeals had been nothing but an illusion.

Even Yang Kai was dumbfounded by that suppression; no wonder Wei Guchang and the others had been trapped there with no way out — if it were him, he would have fallen into it as well.

Still, he was certain he wouldn’t have been trapped for so long — judging by the refinement of his Saint Yuan, Wei Guchang and the others were inferior to him; he could risk using his Vast Heaven Shield as a fulcrum to force his way out of the lava lake’s blockade.

The Saint Yuan within Wei Guchang and the others could not accomplish that.

Once the lava lake disappeared, the force that had bound the turtle shell vanished as well, and Daiyuan easily dragged the shell back from afar.

This turtle shell piqued Yang Kai’s great interest — he had firsthand experience of lava’s lethality, and a seemingly ordinary shell that could float atop it and endure for so long was certainly no common artifact.

While Wei Guchang and the others rested to recover, Yang Kai examined the turtle shell.

The shell was covered in crisscrossing grooves and obviously old; the turtle had to have been a long-lived demonic beast, at least thousands or tens of thousands of years, the shell bearing the marks of wind and frost through the ages.

"This is the shell of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast, a Xuan Water Turtle," came a pleasant voice at his ear — without turning he knew it was Daiyuan.

"You recognize this?" Yang Kai looked at her in astonishment.

“Mm. I’ve read about it in some records,” Daiyuan said, crouching down. She extended a slender jade-like hand and gently traced the patterns and grooves upon the turtle shell. A faint sadness surfaced on her face. “I just don’t know who could have slain it. This shell was even lightly refined by someone—otherwise, there’s no way Junior Sister Xuan’er and the others could have drawn upon its internal water-attribute power for protection. To think that a Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast could exist in a place like this… it seems we’ll have to tread far more carefully from now on.”

A Tenth-Tier demonic beast corresponds to a Void King Realm expert! Even a Ninth-Tier is a rarity on Dark Star; a Tenth-Tier appearing outside would be invincible and bring catastrophe to the entire Dark Star.

"Perhaps there isn’t truly a Tenth-Tier here, or perhaps there was one long ago but not anymore," Yang Kai said thoughtfully.

"Why are you so sure?" Daiyuan asked strangely.

"Just a guess," Yang Kai chuckled, offering no explanation.

He had obtained Soul Cleansing Divine Water in the Flowing Flame Sandland and knew Void King Realm experts had died here before; if Void King Realm experts died here, a dead Tenth-Tier demonic beast would not be surprising.

Having been through so much, Yang Kai felt the Flowing Flame Sandland was not ordinary — there were hidden secrets within, and the weakening of the Third Layer's threat this time had allowed many elites to enter; he didn’t know what change had caused that.

Seeing Yang Kai unwilling to say more, Daiyuan did not press, but smiled and introduced herself plainly: "Let me properly introduce myself — I am Daiyuan, a disciple of Liuli Sect."

"Liuli Sect?" Yang Kai was surprised. "What is Yin Sudie to you?"

At the mention of Yin Sudie, a trace of dislike flashed across Daiyuan’s brow, but she quickly recovered and said lightly, "She is my Junior Sister."

Her tone inexplicably turned chillier, as if Yang Kai’s first reaction to Liuli Sect had been to think of that woman Yin Sudie, which vexed her.

It wasn’t Yang Kai’s fault — his knowledge of Liuli Sect centered only on Yin Sudie. He hadn’t been on Dark Star long and wasn’t a native martial cultivator; how could he know anything else of Liuli Sect?

"That woman is your Junior Sister?" Yang Kai appraised Daiyuan anew, staring her up and down with a strange expression.

He couldn’t say he liked Yin Sudie, nor did he dislike her; she seemed adroit and bewitching, famous alongside Fang Tianzhong and Qu Changfeng and Wei Guchang.

Yang Kai didn’t know how much real substance she had, but her beauty surely added to her renown.

Seeing Daiyuan claim Yin Sudie as her Junior Sister surprised Yang Kai greatly.

Daiyuan seemed a decent, low-key person, nothing like the attention-catching Yin Sudie; the two looked utterly different, so two sisters like them were naturally peculiar.

The surprise passed in an instant; Yang Kai quickly recovered and smiled, "No wonder you’re so formidable — you’re from Liuli Sect."

"You’re not bad either." Daiyuan’s beautiful eyes fixed on Yang Kai as if peering into his soul; this young man at the First Stage of the Saint King Realm had continually astonished her along the way.

"What, Brother Yang didn’t know Daiyuan is of Liuli Sect?" Wei Guchang and Xuan’er approached together, looking much recovered — Yang Kai had given them some pills to help their recovery, his own concocted medicines far superior to what money could buy.

"We were strangers who met along the way and just happened to receive your message, so we hurried over," Yang Kai stood and smiled at Wei Guchang.

"On behalf of our Junior Brothers and Junior Sisters, Wei thanks you two for your great favor!" Wei Guchang stepped forward and, together with Xuan’er, made a grand salute with sincere words.

Yang Kai quickly helped them up, and before he could speak Wei Guchang turned serious: "Brother Yang, if not for you and Daiyuan arriving in time, even a quarter of an hour later and Xuan’er and I would have joined the yellow springs; say no more — if you ever need Wei, just ask; mountain of blades or sea of fire, Wei will not hesitate."

It seemed only now that Wei Guchang truly wished to befriend Yang Kai; their earlier cordiality owed largely to Qian Tong’s orders and some personal appreciation of Yang Kai.

But having been saved this time, Wei Guchang lowered his posture; if it concerned only his life he might not have humbled himself, but Yang Kai had also rescued Xuan’er, the woman he valued more than life!

That favor was immense.

Yang Kai nodded lightly after glancing at him.

Wei Guchang then looked at Daiyuan: "As for Daiyuan… hehe, one day Xuan’er and I will call on Liuli Sect to pay our respects and express thanks; hope Daiyuan won’t shoo us away."

Daiyuan snorted indifferently and barely paid him any mind, instead taking Xuan’er aside to chat.

Wei Guchang smiled wryly, glanced at his recovering juniors, and, not in a hurry, began chatting with Yang Kai.

Through his recounting, Yang Kai learned of the trials the Yingyue Hall disciples had endured.

In a word: unlucky fate!

This time Yingyue Hall sent over seventy people; nearly fifty remained in the First Layer's Heat-Flame Zone, while the remaining twenty entered the Second Layer's heaven-and-earth treasure area, splitting into small teams to search for spiritual herbs and medicines and communicating via Transmission Compasses; all went smoothly and they gained much.

When word came that the Third Layer's threat had weakened, Wei Guchang gathered seven of the elites and rushed to the Third Stage, but upon entering the Third Layer Heat-Flame Zone they were surrounded by a pack of Fire Spirit Beasts; after a long battle they couldn’t hold on and two fell, with Wei Guchang bringing up the rear and saving the rest.

Before they could recover from the sorrow of losing comrades, they stepped into this ancient suppression.

They were trapped for over a month and only rescued today.

Wei Guchang spoke with regret; there was some misfortune involved, but also insufficient strength — this ancient suppression could fool even Origin Returning Realm experts as to its true nature, causing them to fall within.

But the encounter with the pack of Fire Spirit Beasts was truly due to their lack of strength, which led to losses among their fellows.

Compared to their misfortunes, Yang Kai realized his luck was skyrocketing.

Huge Fire Crystal Stones, Fire-Glow Crystal Cores, broken map fragment, Soul Cleansing Divine Water, Nine-Curve Crystal Jade Tree, suspected Dragon Bone and Dragon Pearl, Saint Crystal veins, all sorts of spiritual herbs and fruits and medicines, and that strange condensed heavy space…

The gains Yang Kai had made on this trip were almost unimaginable.

If Wei Guchang knew of these things, he would probably be so vexed he’d spew blood.

In short, since entering the Third Layer, Wei Guchang and the others had obtained nothing but a few Fire Crystal Stones; over a month wasted.

Fortunately there was no loss in the end; had five of them died it would have been a catastrophe — Yingyue Hall losing so many elite disciples at once would create a huge gap in their ranks; while the problem might not show immediately, once Saint King Realm cultivators from other forces rose, Yingyue Hall’s decline would be exposed.

Such a result would be unbearable for anyone.
