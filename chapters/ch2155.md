## Chapter 2155 — You Cannot Enter

Off to the side, Kong Qi was shocked and dismayed.

He had indeed known Gong Wenshan for several decades and understood his character and temper. This man was born to yield to kindness but not to force. If you spoke to him nicely, everything could be discussed, but if you tried to threaten him, that would be a grave mistake.

Gong Wenshan was undoubtedly being threatened by Wuchang now.

Kong Qi could almost foresee the scene of Gong Wenshan flinging his sleeves and leaving…

In a place like this, if Gong Wenshan left, then perhaps no one would be able to unlock the restriction on the Time Temple.

Thinking of this, Kong Qi could no longer care about offending Wuchang. His expression darkened as he shouted in a low voice, “Wuchang, have you cultivated yourself stupid? Brother Gong never said he wouldn’t break the restriction. What’s the point of saying those things?”

Wuchang shot him a cold glance and said, “Who do you think you are? Is it your place to point fingers here?”

Kong Qi’s expression turned angry as he roared, “Aren’t your words a bit too dismissive of others?”

Although he wasn’t as famous as Wuchang, Xia Sheng, and the others, he was still a rising star cultivated by the Qiyao Commerce Guild, with outstanding talent. How could he not have a bit of temper?

“So what?” Wuchang smiled arrogantly. “If you want me to take you seriously, you’ll need some real strength!”

At this moment, Xiao Chen, not knowing what he was thinking, added fuel to the fire, “Brother Wuchang probably doesn’t take anyone seriously… tsk tsk…”

As soon as these words were spoken, Luo Yuan’s brows furrowed. He silently reached out, and the battle axe that had been bounced away by the golden restriction earlier flew back to him with a whoosh.

Wuchang, though a bit rampant, was no fool. Xiao Chen’s words were clearly meant to stir up trouble for him, and he could hear it. So he immediately turned to look at Xiao Chen and sneered, “Brother Xiao, do you have any advice?”

“I wouldn’t dare!” Xiao Chen smiled slightly. “Brother Wuchang is already the number one under the Emperor, how could I dare to advise you on anything?”

These words were even more severe than before. As soon as they were spoken, even Xiao Baiyi, who had been standing silently to the side, showed a hint of fighting spirit.

“Enough, stop arguing! Don’t disturb Brother Gong as he breaks the restriction!” Lan Xun suddenly spoke up.

Upon hearing this, everyone turned to look and found that the source of the quarrel—Gong Wenshan—was already sitting cross-legged in front of the golden light. The previous lazy look in his eyes was gone, replaced by intense concentration as he stared at the golden light, as if trying to discern something from it.

“At least you know what’s good for you!” Wuchang snorted coldly, secretly thinking that Gong Wenshan must have been frightened by his threat.

Not only him, but everyone present thought the same. After all, Gong Wenshan had just asked what benefit there was to breaking the restriction, and after a few words of intimidation from Wuchang, hadn’t he obediently given in?

For a moment, many people showed looks of disdain. Although they still needed Gong Wenshan’s help to enter the Time Temple, that didn’t stop them from looking down on his character.

Only one person, with cold sweat on his forehead, looked thoughtfully at Gong Wenshan’s profile and thought to himself, “This isn’t good… Brother Gong has always been stubborn. He’s never been one to be threatened, yet this time he’s cooperating so much. What kind of scheme is he plotting… Hiss, he’s even showing that wicked smile… It’s over, it’s over!”

The more Kong Qi observed, the more he felt Gong Wenshan’s behavior was off, and an ominous feeling welled up in his heart.

Just then, after observing the golden restriction for a while, Gong Wenshan seemed to have gained something. He reached out and took a delicate, palm-sized Formation Plate from his Spatial Ring, covered in countless intricate symbols and patterns, looking extremely mysterious.

“Gong family’s Huntian Plate?” Lan Xun’s beautiful eyes suddenly lit up, staring intently at the Formation Plate. But soon, she showed a look of disappointment, because the one in Gong Wenshan’s hand was clearly not the real Huntian Plate, but a replica.

Gong Wenshan formed seals with both hands, sending streams of energy into the Formation Plate. Immediately, the Formation Plate turned into a stream of light, darting into the restriction and moving like a nimble fish.

Everyone watched intently, but few could make out what was happening.

Yang Kai could only vaguely guess that the Formation Plate was a Secret Treasure used to help find the weak points of the restriction.

Things were indeed as he thought. The Gong family’s Huntian Plate was said to be able to break all formations and restrictions in the world, relying on its uncanny ability to find weak points or the Formation Core. However, the Huntian Plate was the Gong family’s ancestral treasure. Even with Gong Wenshan’s status, he wasn’t qualified to carry it around.

The Formation Plate he took out was a replica made by the Gong family. Although it was far inferior to the real Huntian Plate, it was still quite effective.

The stream of light kept weaving through the restriction, swift beyond compare. Suddenly, Gong Wenshan’s eyes lit up and he let out a low cry, “Found it… heh heh, just as I suspected, isn’t it?”

He murmured to himself indistinctly, as if speaking to no one in particular.

As he spoke, he reached out and retrieved the Formation Plate.

After a moment, he took out some Formation Foundations from his Spatial Ring, leapt into the air, and with a flurry of movements, sent the formation flags and foundations flying out.

At this moment, Gong Wenshan’s expression was solemn, as if what he was doing was extremely sacred.

The formation flags and foundations disappeared into the void in an instant, their whereabouts unknown.

Gong Wenshan busied himself for the time it takes for an incense stick to burn before finally descending slowly from midair, drenched in sweat.

He wiped the sweat from his forehead, turned around, and said to the crowd who had been waiting for a long time, “It’s done!”

“It’s done?” The faces of the martial artists were stunned. They looked at him, then at the intact golden restriction, disbelief written all over their faces.

Gong Wenshan grinned and said, “If I say it’s done, then naturally… it’s done!”

His words were full of confidence.

As he spoke, he pressed his palms together and clapped sharply. Instantly, countless rays of light burst forth in the void, and as they did, a crack suddenly appeared in the golden restriction covering the Time Temple.

“Open for me!” Gong Wenshan shouted, pushing his hands slowly to either side. As he did, the crack widened, making it look as if he was tearing the restriction apart with his bare hands.

“It’s really open!” This time, the martial artists were shocked.

This was a restriction left behind by the Great Emperor of Time. Even after countless years, it was not something ordinary martial artists could open, yet Gong Wenshan had done it.

“The Gong family’s reputation is well-deserved!” Even Lan Xun couldn’t help but praise.

She had to admit, when it came to the study of formations, Gong Wenshan left her far behind. Even now, she couldn’t see the weak point of the golden restriction, but Gong Wenshan had already broken it.

“Many thanks, Brother Gong! When we get back, I’ll treat you to a drink!” Kong Qi laughed heartily, the first to dash toward the crack and disappear in a flash.

He instinctively felt that staying any longer would only bring trouble, so it was best to leave first.

With him taking the lead, the others naturally rushed toward the crack as well.

Wuchang, Luo Yuan, Xiao Chen, Lan Xun, even Xiao Baiyi and Murong Xiaoxiao, all activated their Origin Qi, guarding against a sudden attack and wary of what dangers might await inside the Time Temple.

This group charged in at the front, and the others didn’t dare compete with them. With Wuchang’s explosive temper, if anyone angered him, he might just kill them on the spot.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…

The sound of breaking air rang out as figures disappeared into the crack one after another.

At that moment, Gong Wenshan glanced at Wuchang meaningfully, a mocking smile on his face.

“What’s going on?” Wuchang frowned, vaguely sensing something was wrong, but still didn’t think much of it. He just wanted to hurry into the Time Temple to snatch the Star Seal and opportunities.

But then, something unexpected happened. As his body passed through the torn crack, an invisible force struck him from ahead, sending him flying dozens of zhang away.

Wuchang’s face changed dramatically. He quickly steadied himself and looked at Gong Wenshan with a gloomy gaze.

Gong Wenshan sneered, pointed at him, and then waved, saying, “Everyone else can enter—only you cannot!”

“So it really was your doing!” Wuchang snorted coldly. How could he not realize this was Gong Wenshan’s revenge?

Earlier, when he threatened Gong Wenshan’s life, the man hadn’t reacted strongly, but it turned out he was waiting for this moment.

This could be called the perfect opportunity and the best method.

Just think, everyone else entered the Time Temple, but Wuchang alone was blocked outside, all because of his earlier threats. How could he not be filled with regret?

“This fellow’s heart is pitch‑black!” Yang Kai looked at the delighted smile on Gong Wenshan’s face and was secretly aghast.

He too had thought Gong Wenshan was afraid of Wuchang and that’s why he broke the restriction, but who would have thought he’d pull such a move? It was truly disgusting.

Thinking this, he didn’t stop his steps. After all, it was best to enter the Time Temple first. Whatever happened between Wuchang and Gong Wenshan had nothing to do with him.

“Do you think you can stop me?” Wuchang asked coldly from below.

Gong Wenshan smiled and said, “Now that the restriction is completely under my control, I can let in whoever I want. Do you think I can’t stop you?”

“In that case… I’ll just kill you!” Wuchang snorted, raising both hands. Suddenly, two different energies appeared on his palms—one fiery red, one snowy white. As soon as they appeared, they radiated completely opposite auras, but surprisingly, Wuchang merged them perfectly into a red-and-white energy sphere, which he hurled straight at Gong Wenshan.

Gong Wenshan stood his ground, neither dodging nor avoiding, only sneering.

The energy sphere crashed down, its terrifying power making everyone’s face change. Yang Kai and the others, who were about to rush into the restriction, quickly dodged to the side to avoid being caught in the blast.

Just as the sphere was about to engulf Gong Wenshan, he casually waved his hand, and a sheet of golden light separated from the restriction, enveloping him completely.

In the next instant, a loud explosion rang out as the power of the Nine Heavens of Ice and Fire erupted.
