## Chapter 539 — Something Serious Happened

Upon hearing Yang Kai’s answer, Yang Zhen was unfazed, as if he had expected this all along. He simply nodded lightly and said, “Since this is your choice, I won’t say much more. Take care of yourself. But let me remind you: if the Seven Great Families have caught even the slightest whiff of something fishy, they will not let this go easily. Our Yang Family will not sever ties with the others because of you. Without returning to your clan for protection, you won’t be able to fend for yourself.”

Having spoken, Yang Zhen stood, and together with several other elders, left the hall.

Before she left, the woman glanced back at Yang Kai and softly said, “You should reconsider. Doing this will not harm you. Even if your cultivation is destroyed, you can live safely within the Yang Family. The clan is willing to meet your every request.”

Yang Kai cast her a cold glare, his eyes filled with ruthless resolve.

The woman slowly shook her head and said nothing further, quickly following the others out.

After their departure, Yang Kai let out a quiet breath, a trace of exhaustion surfacing on his face.

An innocent man bears no fault, but possessing a treasure invites envy—this was the perfect description for the Wan Yao Ling Ye. This also explained why Yang Kai had kept the Wan Yao Ling Ye hidden and closely guarded; only a few of his most trusted confidants knew of its existence. 

Yet, the Eight Great Families had detected suspicion through certain signs, something Yang Kai couldn’t possibly stop.

He couldn’t just ignore his parents now that he possessed such a treasure.

Those in the mansion had been growing stronger rapidly precisely because Xia Ningshang was using the Wan Yao Ling Ye in her pill refining. The medicinal effects seeped into the pills, activating their functions and unknowingly helping to cleanse their meridians and optimize their innate potential.

Still, their progress was relatively slower since they weren’t taking the Ling Liquid directly.

Given the strength of the Eight Great Families and their ravenous desire for the Wan Yao Ling Ye, this situation was delicate and might easily escalate into something severe.

As Yang Kai emerged from the side hall, he bumped into the anxious-looking Qiu Yimeng.

Yang Kai rarely saw Qiu Yimeng display such helplessness. Miss Qiu was always composed, no matter the danger or difficulty. Yet, now her worry and fear were plainly visible; anyone who wasn’t blind could tell.

“Yang Kai,” Qiu Yimeng called softly, her voice trembling slightly.

Yang Kai remained calm, fixing his gaze on her. “What happened?”

“My father sent someone to send a message, ordering me to return to the clan immediately,” Qiu Yimeng replied hurriedly.

“That was quick,” Yang Kai smiled, though his gaze was as cold as a blade.

No sooner had Yang Zhen left than the Qiu Family sent a summons to Qiu Yimeng, demanding her swift return to Zhongdu. The Eight Great Families truly acted as one.

“What do you mean?” Qiu Yimeng asked, puzzled and nervous. When she first received the summons, a wave of unease gripped her heart. She rushed to see Yang Kai, only to hear his cryptic statement, which only deepened her unease.

“It’s nothing,” Yang Kai adjusted his expression and smiled. “When are you leaving?”

“Right away,” Qiu Yimeng bit her lip. “And my father sent word that I must bring the Autumn Rain Hall’s people back as well.”

Autumn Rain Hall was the small group of reinforcements Qiu Yimeng had brought when she moved into Yang Kai’s residence.

“I understand.”

Qiu Yimeng shook her head slightly, a pained expression crossing her face. “I don’t know why, but I have this restless feeling, like something big is about to happen. And if I leave here…I might never return.”

Qiu Shoucheng’s order to bring back the people from Autumn Rain Hall already said a lot.

Qiu Yimeng was not a fool. Smart as she was, she could sense the underlying scheming. Yet, she had no clue what was truly going on. She had come to assist Yang Kai’s fight for succession, temporarily leaving the clan; she represented herself, not the Qiu Family.

The true ally of the Qiu family was Sixth Brother Yang Shen of the Yang Family, and since the Succession War was not over, there was no reason for the Qiu family to suddenly recall her.

“You’re overthinking,” Yang Kai grinned at her.

With a nervous look, Qiu Yimeng grabbed Yang Kai’s arm and gazed at him pleadingly. “Do you know something?”

Yang Kai shook his head. “How would I know your family’s business?”

“Is it related to the elders from the Yang Family coming looking for you?” Qiu Yimeng pressed.

As always, Miss Qiu’s insight was impressive.

“No,” Yang Kai shook his head again. “Probably just your Uncle Qiu missing you after so long and wanting you to come back.”

Qiu Yimeng stared at him blankly, then slowly released his arms, giving a bitter smile. “You’re always like this, never telling me anything.”

Yang Kai opened his mouth but didn’t know what to say.

“Since that’s how it is…” Qiu Yimeng took a deep breath and softly added, “Then I won’t ask anymore. Take care of yourself.”

“You’ve worked hard recently. I’ll see you off,” Yang Kai said quietly.

Outside the mansion, the people of Autumn Rain Hall were ready to depart. Qiu Yimeng and Yang Kai exchanged looks — hers filled with expectancy and longing, his calm and indifferent.

The atmosphere was strange.

After a long moment, Qiu Yimeng’s eyes dimmed, and she forced a faint smile before turning and leading the Autumn Rain Hall group toward Zhongdu.

Until the very end, she heard no attempt from Yang Kai to persuade her to stay.

If Yang Kai had begged her to remain, she would have ignored the Qiu Family’s orders and stayed.

Yang Kai watched her leave.

Both knew that this time, Qiu Yimeng truly would never return.

Suddenly, three people approached. The leader was steady-footed, eyes piercing, accompanied by two Divine Roaming Realm peak experts, their presence subdued yet commanding.

This was the posture of true power.

Qiu Yimeng immediately halted, stunned, and bowed respectfully. “Uncle Huo!”

Huo Zheng, the head of the Huo Family, stopped, smiled faintly at Qiu Yimeng, and nodded. “My dear niece, are you heading back to Zhongdu?”

“Yes,” Qiu Yimeng replied with a smile.

“Good. You’d better go back soon. Your father’s waiting.”

With that, Huo Zheng led the two Huo Family experts and strode toward Yang Kai’s mansion.

Qiu Yimeng turned, her face filled with shock.

She hadn’t expected that not only had the Qiu family summoned her back, but Huo Xingchen would be brought back as well.

Huo Zheng’s arrival was clearly to fetch that prodigal son. If he didn’t personally intervene, no one in the Huo Family could control Huo Xingchen.

Outside the mansion, Yang Kai looked calmly at their approach, just as surprised as Qiu Yimeng, greeting Huo Zheng.

Huo Zheng nodded lightly, his gaze complex as he looked at Yang Kai.

“If you’re looking for Young Master Huo, he’s inside,” Yang Kai said calmly.

“Good, I’ll get him myself,” Huo Zheng nodded without further words and led the two family experts inside Yang Kai’s estate.

Not long after, Yang Kai heard Huo Xingchen’s screams—like a pig being slaughtered. Soon, Huo Zheng emerged. The eldest young master, the Zhongdu Wolf, was now held tightly under one arm by a Divine Roaming Realm Ninth Stage master, utterly powerless.

“Old man, put me down!” Huo Xingchen struggled and yelled to no avail, the expert ignoring him completely.

“You offended me—you’re dead meat. Want me to castrate you and feed your bits to the dogs?” Huo Xingchen continued shouting.

“Who do you think you are? Calling me ‘old man’ in front of me!” Huo Zheng glared coldly at his son.

Huo Xingchen instantly quieted, smiling awkwardly. “Dad, I wasn’t talking to you. But what are you doing? This is embarrassing, in public.”

“Shut up and come back to Zhongdu with me!”

“Why?” Huo Xingchen was confused.

“I said shut up. Keep babbling and I’ll slap you.”

“Da-da-dad… Let’s talk this out like gentlemen. Alright, alright. I’ll go back with you, but you have to let me say goodbye to Young Master Kai. We’ve been through hardships together; we’ve formed a bond.”

Huo Zheng frowned and glanced at Yang Kai before nodding.

The Huo Family expert immediately released Huo Xingchen.

“I’ll wait over there for you,” Huo Zheng instructed sternly.

“Got it,” Huo Xingchen nodded seriously.

After the three from the Huo Family left, Huo Xingchen chuckled and tilted his head toward Yang Kai. “It seems… something serious is happening.”

Seeing Qiu Yimeng preparing to leave as well made his heart skip a beat. Combined with his father’s personal appearance to fetch him, Huo Xingchen sensed something unusual.

“Not convenient to say?” Huo Xingchen shrugged. “Forget it, didn’t ask. Since my dad showed up, I can’t stay anyway. Knowing too much won’t do me any favors.”

His face suddenly grew serious. “Young Master Kai, you’re destined for greatness. I don’t want to see you die young. I don’t know what’s going on now, but this is definitely a tough time. You must endure. No matter what others think of you, I stand firmly by your side. If you die before me… heh, I’ll dig up your corpse and whip it hundreds of times every day in my lifetime. I’ve never worshiped anyone before, don’t disgrace my respect.”

Yang Kai’s lips curled into a wicked grin. “Farewell, no seeing you off!”

“Farewell!” Huo Xingchen laughed heartily and strode forward.

Two scions of great super families left Yang Kai’s residence, one of whom had always been Yang Kai’s right-hand.

Outside, several young commanders who heard the commotion looked shocked, utterly bewildered by what had transpired.

The upheaval had come like a violent storm, leaving no time to prepare.

Even as the figures of Qiu Yimeng and Huo Xingchen disappeared, no one had fully recovered.

After a long moment, they began to anxiously bombard Yang Kai with questions.

“Quiet!” Han Xiao Qi of Wan Hua Palace stepped forward. “With all this noise, how can Yang Kai answer?”

The crowd fell silent, all eyes eagerly watching Yang Kai, hoping for answers.

“Come inside to speak,” Yang Kai said softly, inhaling quietly before turning into the mansion.

Everyone hurried after him.
