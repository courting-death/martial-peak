## Chapter 1728 — Transfer Station

Lingxiao Sect's Void King-Grade Warship had been forged with a massive infusion of Thousand Illusions Glaze, which not only greatly enhanced the warship's defenses but, through the control of arrays within the vessel, allowed it to disguise itself as a single meteor as it sailed the Star Domain, thereby deceiving the eyes of onlookers.

Such a technique could only be pulled off by Yang Yan; across the entire Star Domain no other artificer could possibly refine that much Thousand Illusions Glaze into a warship.

Before the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain, under the eyes of all, Yang Kai simply released the Stone Puppet and let it go about mining on its own.

The Stone Puppet's innate divine talent was to swallow various rare minerals and extract their essences; since Thousand Illusions Glaze was a kind of mineral, it was inevitably countered by the Stone Puppet.

Even the Domain Stone mountain in Blood Prison had been hollowed out by the Stone Puppet, so how could the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain withstand its claws?

To Gong Aofu and the others' astonished gaze, the Stone Puppet quickly came before the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain, then opened its huge mouth, lay beneath the mountain, and began to gnaw in great, slobbering bites.

Crack, crack, crack...

Crisp sounds rang out; plainly visible to the naked eye, the Stone Puppet had gnawed a hole in the mountain. In the span of hardly any time, the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain that had baffled the Liuli Sect for millennia had lost a huge chunk.

The Liuli Sect's warriors watched, dumbfounded.

After a while more, the Stone Puppet's entire body had burrowed into the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain; though its internal movements could not be seen, the cracking sounds continued without stop, so one could imagine that many more chunks of Thousand Illusions Glaze were being devoured.

"Sect Master. This puppet being actually has such a miraculous ability?" Gong Aofu cried out.

She knew of the Stone Puppet's existence—after all, it had appeared in the battle at Dragon Lair Mountain years ago. She had watched it from afar back then; at the time the Stone Puppet had taken the form of a Stone Giant, wielding the Heaven-Shaking Pillar with terrifying majesty.

Unexpectedly, besides its astonishing combat power, the Stone Puppet could so easily chew through Thousand Illusions Glaze.

"Heh heh, it's a very special existence; it helped me a great deal," Yang Kai answered casually, not meaning to explain. After a moment's thought he added, "I need a considerable amount of Thousand Illusions Glaze..."

"Sect Master, do as you please; even if you moved the entire Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain away it wouldn't matter!" Gong Aofu volunteered before he could finish speaking.

"That won't be necessary," Yang Kai said with an embarrassed smile. "This Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain isn't small; I would only take one hundredth. That will be more than enough."

"If that's the case, it will probably take two or three days to finish. Sect Master, if you don't mind, why not rest at the main peak first? We'll come back in two or three days."

"All right." Yang Kai nodded.

Gong Aofu immediately made arrangements and personally escorted him, Su Yan and Xia Ningshang to the main peak, where they lodged in the finest palace.

She did not set a banquet for Yang Kai, for she knew he did not care for such things; she merely instructed her disciples to serve him with utmost care and to not disturb him when he wished to be left alone.

Three days later, everything was in order. The Stone Puppet had devoured three days' worth of Thousand Illusions Glaze; its belly looked rather round, a testament to the vast quantity it had consumed.

Yang Kai had it regurgitate the Thousand Illusions Glaze. After storing the haul into his Spatial Ring, he took his leave from Gong Aofu.

Before departing, he left Liuli Sect several Origin-Grade Secret Treasures and some Origin-Grade Spiritual Pills for cultivation.

They served as payment for taking those Thousand Illusions Glaze; whether Origin-Grade Secret Treasures or Origin-Grade Spiritual Pills, on Dark Star they were exceptionally precious. Gong Aofu could not hide her delight and led the sect elders and elite disciples to give Yang Kai a respectful escort.

Ten days later, at Lingxiao Sect.

In the plaza before the deliberation hall, a brand-new Space Array had been arranged under Yang Kai's direction.

This Space Array differed somewhat from those Yang Kai had previously set on Dark Star; chiefly it occupied less ground, yet the entire array conveyed a more solemn gravity.

This was an array capable of ultra-long-distance, cross-stellar teleportation!

It was also the array Yang Kai used to pinpoint Lingxiao Sect!

Just as before, with this array as the foundation, Yang Kai only needed to lay a corresponding array on another star; once it located here, teleportation would be possible.

Thus Lingxiao Sect's two great Space Arrays had taken shape.

One had been placed outside Lingxiao Sect to link the whole of Dark Star; the other was the one just completed—Yang Kai was eager to see where in the Star Domain it could eventually connect.

In three months’ time, even after the entire Lingxiao Sect poured in all its strength, they had managed to gather less than two thousand pieces of Ethereal Crystal for Yang Kai.

These Ethereal Crystals were nearly all the reserves on Dark Star; unless there were undiscovered Ethereal Crystal veins, Yang Kai estimated these crystals would suffice to set up three or four cross-Star Domain Space Arrays.

After tying up sundry affairs and bidding farewell to kin and friends, Yang Kai made one more trip to the Sixth Layer of Flowing Flame Sandland to converse with Yang Yan for a while, and only then summoned the Star Shuttle and shot skyward.

Within Lingxiao Sect, ten thousand people looked up, watching the fleeing light shuttle into the clouds and finally vanish from sight.

"Travel safely!" Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, standing on different peaks, silently sent him their wishes at the same time.

...

One million li from Dark Star, the invisible Star Domain gale was everywhere; starry-sky storms, large and small, converged here, raged, were annihilated, and then re-formed in endless cycles.

The rushing Meteorite Sea could pulverize any warrior or warship that dared to trespass here.

This formed Dark Star's first layer of barrier.

Dark Star's warriors called it—the Death Domain!

It lay a million li out, wrapping Dark Star, preventing anyone from leaving Dark Star and likewise barring anyone from intruding.

If the dangers were only at that level, they wouldn’t be enough to deter a Void King Realm expert’s steps. Even though Dark Star was remote and isolated, over tens of thousands of years there would still have been Void King Realm experts arriving here.

Yet within this Death Domain there was something that made even Void King Realm experts blanch.

The power of Imperial Might!

Only Imperial Might could make Void King Realm experts hesitate.

The last time Yang Kai left Dark Star with Qian Tong and the others, they had relied on the Void King-Grade Warship's formidable defenses to force their way out. But this time he was alone, and the Void King-Grade Warship had been left behind at Lingxiao Sect as a precaution.

Yang Kai could only rely on himself.

He had once been ignorant of how the Death Domain formed, but after hearing Yang Yan relate so many ancient secrets, he realized this Death Domain was the battlefield left behind from Yang Yan's titanic clash with the Insect Emperor.

Thus it was suffused with Imperial Might, which made it exceedingly perilous.

Fortunately, although Imperial Might was terrifying, Yang Kai had felt it before; when the Imperial Garden had opened he had even used Imperial Might to fuse Spatial Force into his Shi field.

His resistance to Imperial Might was, he believed, not inferior to anyone else's.

He charged straight into the Death Domain, dodging meteorites that pelted him from all directions.

The invisible Star Domain gale lashed at him like countless blades, slicing at his body, sending off dazzling sparks and producing a grinding, teeth-clenching sound.

A halo of five-colored radiance blossomed outside Yang Kai as he employed the Undying Five Elements Sword to shield himself.

Coupled with the continual intake of the Huntian Pill, Yang Kai's physical power had already been elevated to an almost unimaginable realm.

The intangible gale that even Void King Realm warriors feared could not harm him in the slightest. Occasional meteorites that struck him were shattered in an instant.

Completely unafraid, he charged straight into a massive Star Domain storm, one so vast it could devour an entire star, and in the next instant, his figure was swallowed whole by the raging tempest.

Yet not long after, Yang Kai calmly emerged from the other side of the storm.

He carved his way through thorns and obstacles, charging forward without hesitation—his momentum was utterly unstoppable!

Yang Kai even had the leisure to contemplate the wonder and profundity of Imperial Might within this Death Domain.

This proved more beneficial to his growth than absorbing the energy from Domain Stones.

His Shi had already reached consummation; his Saint Yuan, body and Divine Sense were all at the apex of the Origin Returning Realm.

Were it not for suppression by Dark Star's heaven-and-earth laws, he might have tried to break through the bottleneck to the Void King Realm and attain its majesty.

Time flowed slowly, and his gains grew ever greater.

But Yang Kai soon discovered a problem: while comprehending Imperial Might in the Death Domain was rare and precious, Imperial Might itself felt too abstruse—far less graspable than the Domain Field energy contained within Domain Stones.

After a brief reflection, Yang Kai understood why.

He was only at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm; the next realm was the Void King Realm, and above the Void King Realm there was yet another higher realm—only at that higher realm did one reach Yang Yan's level and possess Imperial Might.

To attempt to comprehend Imperial Might now was simply too advanced.

It was like a child attempting to stand and walk before it had even learned to crawl—naturally, it would be beyond its capability.

It seemed best that one should train in the Death Domain after ascending to the Void King Realm.

With that in mind, Yang Kai ceased wasting time and charged straight onward.

His Sea of Consciousness contained a Star Chart, so he never worried about getting lost in the vast Star Domain. Through the Star Chart he could roughly estimate how far different stars lay from Dark Star, an advantage that helped him pick locations for laying Space Arrays.

One year later, on a certain day, Yang Kai descended onto a cold Dead Star.

Such cold dead stars—without any sentient aura, without heavenly Spiritual Qi, even lacking formed heavenly laws—were countless across the Star Domain. Perhaps after billions of years some of these dead stars might evolve rules and give birth to life, but that time was too remote; most dead stars from birth to destruction remained in such desolate solitude.

After landing, Yang Kai did not rest immediately; he searched a radius of three hundred thousand li.

After confirming there was no trace of sentient breath, he finally found a valley-like formation in which to arrange the first Space Array!

This Space Array would become Dark Star's transfer station connecting it to the outside world; it was an indispensable presence.
