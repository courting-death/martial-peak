## Chapter 1630 — One Year

The woman frowned and asked in puzzlement, "Junior Sister, you know this person too?"

Hearing her ask that, Su Yan suddenly realized she had shown some loss of composure.

Just now as she was walking, she had unexpectedly heard someone mention the name Yang Kai and had immediately hurried over.

She drew a soft breath, smoothed the odd look from her face, and nodded. "Yes, I know him. Senior Sister, could you tell me when you met him and how he was? Junior Sister would be deeply grateful."

"It seems Junior Sister has a rather close relationship with him," the leading woman laughed lightly, showing no interest in digging into details. "Telling you is fine, but this was a matter from several years ago."

"Several years ago?" Su Yan knit her brows.

“Mm, Junior Sister, you know as well—several years ago when the Imperial Garden opened, I, along with a few of our fellow disciples, went there. It was at that time that I encountered him. If not for his intervention, we Senior and Junior Sisters would have suffered grievous losses, perhaps even perished under the hands of Fire Radiance Sect’s Kong Wendong! He lent us his aid and even killed Kong Wendong.”

"He killed Kong Wendong?"

"Kong Wendong was a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm cultivator. If he was killed by him, doesn’t that mean he was exceptionally powerful?"

The people who had been speaking with the woman clicked their tongues in astonishment.

If Yang Kai were here, he would certainly recognize this woman.

During that Imperial Garden expedition, the first clash of martial artists Yang Kai encountered was between this woman and Kong Wendong as they fought over an ancient hidden grotto.

It was at that moment that Yang Kai obtained his True Understanding of the Dao of Alchemy and the Purple Void Cauldron.

"Can you tell me the details?" Su Yan’s beautiful eyes lit with interest as she looked at her expectantly.

The woman regarded Su Yan thoughtfully, as if realizing something, then nodded. "I can."

She then proceeded to recount the events that had taken place in the Imperial Garden years ago. A group of Ice Heart Valley disciples listened with rapt attention, while Su Yan had already drifted into a daze.

He had been so formidable even then.

She didn’t know who Kong Wendong was, but from the awe of the nearby disciples and a few snippets of their conversation, Su Yan could infer some facts.

That Kong Wendong was absolutely a top expert of the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, yet Yang Kai had managed to kill him years ago when he was only a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!

Several years had passed since then. What realm had Yang Kai reached now? What kind of terrifying strength did he possess?

Her junior brother, her man, was so outstanding.

A faint smile bloomed on Su Yan’s face, and for a moment the whole Icebound Island seemed to brighten.

"Junior Sister Su, hurry along — don’t make things difficult for us!" urged the tall woman tasked with watching Su Yan, impatient; Su Yan’s radiance prickled her eyes.

"Yes, stop dawdling. If the Great Elder finds out he'd punish us — Junior Sister Su, will you take the blame for us?" another woman shouted.

The others stared at them in surprise, then glanced at Su Yan, unsure what to make of the scene.

Su Yan thanked the senior sister who had told her about Yang Kai’s deeds, bid farewell, and continued toward her ice residence with light steps, her earlier worries swept away.

……

At the bottom of the Cang River, the Xuan Realm Pearl lay buried under silt, lying dormant for more than a year.

One day, a school of foot-long fish swam over the Xuan Realm Pearl, skimming just above the silt. The leading fish’s tail whipped, stirring the silt; the whirl of water pulled at the Xuan Realm Pearl and exposed it.

The following fish opened their mouths and swallowed the Xuan Realm Pearl; awkwardly they writhed a few times, then drifted downstream with the school as if nothing had happened.

Over ten days later, the fish rushed into a vast lake. Upon entering, a colossal dark shape appeared beneath the water. It opened its huge maw like a whale inhaling and sucked in great numbers of fish. Fewer than a fifth of the school survived the passage downstream.

After a while the dark shape belched contentedly and slipped away.

Several days later, more than ten thousand li from the lake’s mouth, an iron boat lazily sailed the surface. Onboard were martial artists in sturdy garb, each channeling Saint Yuan and releasing secret arts and Secret Treasure radiance as they battled a gigantic dark shape beneath the boat.

Half an hour later the dark shape was slain. The martial artists rejoiced and hauled the carcass from the lake.

It proved to be a monstrous fish roughly five zhang long, its eyes like bronze gongs, blood-red and glaring, its mouth full of serrated fangs and its tail like a meteor hammer bristling with barbs; it looked hideously ferocious.

Many of the fighters had been wounded in the struggle, but now they sat nearby with joy on their faces, treating their injuries and eyeing the spoils.

"Uncle Wang, this Meteor Fish is enormous. Judging by its earlier might, it should be a top Eighth-Tier demonic beast," a young man at First Stage of the Saint King Realm said, kicking the fish’s belly as he smiled toward an elderly man in a blue robe.

The old man smiled, stroked his beard, and nodded. "Indeed. This Meteor Fish has grown to its limit — truly an Eighth-Tier top demonic beast."

"Ha! We struck it rich. The Meteor Fish’s inner core is extremely rare; at the very least it’ll fetch two hundred thousand Saint Crystals. It’s far more valuable than the inner core of a beast of the same rank," the youth laughed loudly.

"Yes. With this Meteor Fish we won’t have come back empty-handed. Selling its inner core can supply the Wang Family’s cultivators for six months of training."

"Uncle Wang, shall I do the cutting, or would you prefer?" the youth asked the elder.

"You do it; I’m too old for the sight of blood!" the elder joked, and the whole boat burst into laughter.

The youth accepted without hesitation, drew a dagger gleaming with silver light about the length of an arm, filled it with Saint Yuan to sharpen it further, and expertly gutted the Meteor Fish. He soon found a fist-sized inner core near its skull.

He respectfully presented the inner core to the elder, who examined it carefully and said, "A fine inner core, suffused with exceptionally rich water-attribute profound intent. If given to someone who cultivates water-attribute secret techniques, it will surely increase their power. I will keep the inner core for now and hand it to the Family Head when we return. Everyone on this expedition will receive a reward."

Hearing this, those who had fought cried out in excitement.

"This Meteor Fish is a rare sight; its flesh is said to be delicious — don’t let it go to waste. Have people come and process it," the elder ordered before turning and entering the cabin.

The youth scratched his head and called a few others to help process the fish.

Naturally the youth didn’t want to do such menial work; those assigned to butcher the fish were the boat’s weakest cultivators, who generally did not fight and only handled chores to earn Saint Crystals for their training.

Although the Meteor Fish was large, the processing proved not difficult.

Before long everything was done. The fresh meat was preserved by special means, while the intestines and viscera were tossed into the lake.

In a shabby little cabin on the boat, a girl of about sixteen or seventeen closed the door and crept onto her bed. Glancing around furtively as though guilty, she cautiously reached into her bosom and brought out an unremarkable bead.

The bead was only the size of a longan seed and seemed unremarkable.

Yet her chest thumped with rapid heartbeat.

"Is this an inner core?" she murmured to herself, her face flushed with excitement as she bit her pale lip and stared at the bead in her palm uncertainly.

She had been among those processing the fish and had inadvertently found the bead inside its belly, then, inexplicably, hid it.

She believed it to be the Meteor Fish’s inner core!

Thinking back on her action now, she felt a fresh wave of dread.

Since she had come with the family’s iron boat, everything obtained should belong to the family. She did not know why she had been bewitched into taking the bead for herself.

Now that turning it in was out of the question — if she did, she might be punished by family law.

"It’s not an inner core, is it?" she muttered, still unsettled, seeking excuses to ease her guilt.

After all, the inner core had already been taken by Uncle Wang, and she had never heard of a demonic beast producing two inner cores. Moreover, the bead gave off no energy fluctuations, so it clearly could not be an inner core.

If it’s not an inner core, then what is it? Why is it inside the fish’s belly?

She cocked her head and kept turning the bead over in her hands, baffled.

At that moment, the bead flashed once, then, strangely, vanished from her hand.

A person appeared before her like a ghost.

The girl’s face turned pale; she froze and looked forward.

Standing before her was a young man of perhaps twenty-five or twenty-six, his expression still slightly dazed, as if he didn’t quite understand the present situation either.

Their eyes met; terror filled the girl’s beautiful eyes. She opened her mouth to scream.

Yang Kai was quick; he clapped his hand over her mouth.

The girl struggled wildly, delivering a flurry of punches and kicks at Yang Kai, her gaze full of panic as if he were an unforgivable villain.

"Don’t cry out, don’t move!" Yang Kai frowned and barked.

He still didn’t fully understand what had happened, but at first glance he knew he was on an iron boat with many people. Although the strongest among them was only a First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm and not truly threatening, Yang Kai did not want to attract trouble.

He could only handle the girl roughly for the moment.

The girl resisted stubbornly and continued to struggle.

Seeing that gentle words failed, Yang Kai suddenly let out a wicked, hoarse laugh, a sinister light in his eyes as he cast a leering glance at the girl’s delicate bosom and hissed low, "If you don’t cooperate, I’ll rape you first and then kill you, and I’ll slaughter everyone on this boat and throw them to the fish!"

The girl trembled; a pleading look came into her eyes and she shook her head, tears streaming down her face, utterly terrified.

Frightened by the threat, she promptly fell silent and stopped struggling.
