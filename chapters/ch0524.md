## Chapter 524 — It Is Your Blessing

After Xiang Chu was killed, the destructive energy hidden within the dark clouds in the sky seemed to be fully unleashed. One wave after another relentlessly descended upon Yang Kai, causing everyone watching to tremble with fear. No one knew if this youngest scion of the Yang Family could survive this baptism and be reborn anew, or if he would be utterly destroyed.

Yang Zhao stared blankly into the air and roared, "Eldest Brother, are you really standing with Ninth Brother?"

Yang Wei shook his head, his voice cold and sharp: "It’s not that Eldest Brother wants to side with Ninth Brother, but Second Brother, you’ve gone too far. Clear your mind and think carefully about what you’re doing now!"

"The succession battle spares no means; I of course know what I’m doing," Yang Zhao snorted coldly.

Yang Wei’s face was filled with disappointment and anguish as he said, “If you want to protect Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu from Ninth Brother, I have nothing to say. But if you intend to ruin Ninth Brother’s lifetime achievements, I cannot just sit by and watch. I believe… if it were Ninth Brother, he wouldn’t interfere while you were advancing to the next great realm.”

Yang Zhao froze for a moment. A sliver of clarity flickered in his blood-red eyes, bringing a painful expression to his face. But almost immediately, it twisted into a ferocious, mad look.

At this moment, he was utterly incapable of steadying his mind.

Had he been lucid, he might have realized some truths, but now his mind was consumed solely by the desire to defeat Yang Kai, driving every ounce of his will.

Boom—

While the two brothers conversed, a sudden explosion rang out. Along with the sound, an unparalleled demonic aura surged forth from Yang Kai’s body, more dense and overwhelming than before.

Affected by this aura, all the warriors found it increasingly difficult to suppress the evil stirring in their hearts — even those masters at the Divine Roaming Realm.

Earth Demon laughed wildly, reveling in the aura as if at home, his strength seemingly surging to a whole new level.

“What exactly is wrong with this kid?” Meng Wuya murmured gravely from afar.

He had never known that such a tremendous amount of evil energy had gathered inside Yang Kai. Where had Yang Kai’s previous True Yang Yuan Qi gone? That should have been the bane of evil energy.

“Is this dangerous, Master?” Xia Ningshang fretted, nearly in tears. Despite the distance, she was affected by the demonic aura, the faint blue gem on her forehead emitting gentle light that pushed back the surrounding darkness.

“I don’t know,” Meng Wuya admitted, bewildered. “Right now, his consciousness should be fully immersed within his mind, unable to control the energy within his body.”

This ascension was different from usual. This time, Yang Kai was breaking into the Divine Roaming Realm, opening a Sea of Consciousness unique to cultivators.

His awareness was currently trapped inside his mind. Essentially, he had no control over his body or the energy within it, allowing those evil forces to erupt wildly.

“This is bad,” Meng Wuya’s face darkened with worry as the battle grew more violent and bloody. He wasn’t concerned whether Yang Kai could survive this tribulation, but rather what would happen if the entire War City became contaminated by this evil energy.

If tens of thousands within the city were influenced by Yang Kai’s ascension, causing their minds to shift drastically, Meng Wuya would become a sinner remembered throughout history.

His Divine Sense spread outward, his expression growing grimmer.

He realized battles were erupting from all corners within the city. Some of these skirmishes had nothing to do with the Succession War, but after being drawn out by the energy within Yang Kai, countless warriors struggled to control their emotions, and even minor disputes sparked enormous conflicts.

At this moment, the entire War City was tense and warlike, weapons flashing and blood staining the ground.

As time passed, the situation could only worsen—unless Yang Kai could rein in the demonic aura within himself.

One man’s ascension influencing an entire city was truly unprecedented. Meng Wuya was deeply shaken.

Suddenly, his expression changed as he focused on the central part of the city and sighed, “Finally, they have been alerted.”

“Who has been alerted?” Xia Ningshang asked anxiously.

“A few old immortals,” Meng Wuya said, taking a deep breath. “Disciple, return to the mansion. This place might soon become unsafe.”

“I don’t want to go back...” Xia Ningshang shook her head, her eyes fixed on where Yang Kai remained. “Junior Brother is still there.”

“Return,” Meng Wuya said firmly. “Rest assured, I will bring Yang Kai back safely.”

Xia Ningshang hesitated for a moment before gently nodding. “If you cannot bring him back, then I shall die as well.”

With that, she sped toward Yang Kai’s mansion like a whirlwind.

She knew staying would neither help Yang Kai nor reduce the burden on her master, so she dared not linger.

Watching her disappear, Meng Wuya smiled bitterly. He didn’t even know how much he owed Yang Kai to go to such lengths for him.

From afar, eight figures flew toward Yang Kai’s side. Meng Wuya sighed and followed.

These eight belonged to the Eight Great Families, all beyond the Divine Roaming Realm and usually sitting in seclusion at the Fengshen Hall, uninterested in external affairs. Today, they had no intention of getting involved in this conflict between Yang Zhao and Yang Kai.

But now, they could not stay idle.

The entire War City was draped in demonic aura, affecting everyone to varying degrees, forcing them to step in.

Their expressions were indifferent, though a few were displeased by being disturbed due to Yang Kai.

Upon approaching Yang Kai’s vicinity, they halted.

No one noticed their arrival at first, so everyone was stunned when they suddenly appeared.

“Enough!” Yang Liting said coldly. At his command, warriors from both Yang Zhao’s and Yang Kai’s mansions halted their fierce attacks as if an invisible force compelled them.

Yang Wei’s expression tightened, and he hurriedly bowed, “Greetings, honored elders!”

Yang Zhao’s eyes were bloodshot, but he quickly suppressed the wildness in his face and bowed respectfully as well.

Before these eight seniors, he dared not act rashly.

Liu Qingyao, from the teahouse, also flew over quickly to greet them.

All showed great respect.

Yang Liting glanced coldly at Yang Zhao, then raised his hand and sent a wave of energy into Yang Zhao’s body.

Under this influence, Yang Zhao’s eyes cleared immediately. He stared blankly at everything around him and recalled his previous orders and actions, sweat beading on his forehead.

With clarity restored, he regained his sanity.

“To succumb to such petty evil energy—do you truly deserve to be a disciple of the Yang Family?” Yang Liting rebuked lightly.

Yang Zhao’s face turned pale. He lowered his head and cupped his fists, “I have disappointed Senior Elder.”

Yang Liting snorted lightly, not even glancing at him. Yang Zhao’s face drained of color in shame, the total disregard cutting him deep, awakening a subtle self-doubt that he was indeed inferior to Ninth Brother.

He quickly dispelled the thought, fearing being influenced again. If that happened, no matter what, he feared he would never rise within the Yang Family.

“You’ve done reasonably well,” Yang Liting glanced at Yang Wei and nodded slightly.

Yang Wei’s expression remained composed as he replied evenly, “Senior Elder’s praise is too kind.”

Due to various reasons, Yang Zhao had been influenced by the demonic energy. In contrast, Yang Wei’s steadfastness naturally earned Yang Liting’s higher regard.

“This young lady is also impressive,” a slightly plump elder said, smiling warmly at Qiu Yimeng. She was one of the few untouched by Yang Kai’s influence.

“My Qiu Family is naturally outstanding,” Qiu Daoren’s face showed a proud expression. He was quite satisfied with Qiu Yimeng’s performance.

“Greetings, Senior Elder,” Qiu Yimeng stepped forward, bowed, then immediately asked, “May I ask the purpose behind the appearance of the eight elders?”

Her face was tense. These eight elders usually kept a low profile, unaffected by worldly affairs. Their sudden appearance clearly concerned Yang Kai.

Moreover, now the situation with Yang Kai was unusual. The Eight Great Families were hostile toward the Cangyun Evil Land; their elders especially despised demonic cultivators. Seeing Yang Kai in his current state made Qiu Yimeng deeply uneasy.

Qiu Daoren’s expression stiffened as he said, “You should ask Brother Yang. After all, this is a matter stirred up by the Yang Family.”

Qiu Yimeng’s gaze immediately locked on Yang Liting.

He said nothing, eyes fixed coldly on Yang Kai, undergoing his baptism amid the violent heavenly power. His expression grew increasingly severe.

Qiu Yimeng’s heart sank with unease.

His look was one of utter disgust, but Yang Kai was still family—a junior of Yang Liting’s. Had anyone else shown such symptoms, they likely would have been executed long ago.

“Old man, you can look all you want, but don’t lay hands on my Yang Family’s Young Master, or I won’t let it slide!” Earth Demon bellowed recklessly at Yang Liting as if reckless of death.

Everyone’s expressions changed dramatically.

No one dared speak so boldly in front of those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

Hearing Earth Demon’s words, the eight elders simultaneously turned their gaze to him, their Divine Senses locking onto Earth Demon. His dark energy surged intensely, resonating ominously with the evil energy inside Yang Kai, instilling a sense that the apocalypse was near.

“His demonic cultivation method, did you teach him?” Yang Liting asked coldly, showing no respect to Earth Demon.

“Heh, you’re mistaken,” Earth Demon slowly shook his head, showing no fear. “My humble skills could never have produced the Young Master’s achievements. He cultivated this on his own. The Yang Family’s ability to produce such a Young Master is your blessing. You must treasure and protect him. The future of the Yang Family rests entirely upon him.”
