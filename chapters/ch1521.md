## Chapter 1521 — Guests Arrive

When Yang Kai walked into the hall, the three of them all turned their gazes toward him, each look carrying a tone of appraisal.

Though they gave no deliberate display of power, the aura that naturally emanated from the three was already considerable; if an ordinary cultivator of the Origin Returning Realm came here, they would likely find each step arduous.

Yang Kai’s pace paused for a heartbeat, but very quickly he recovered his composure and stepped in with calm ease, treating that invisible pressure as no more than a breeze against his face.

A flicker of surprise crossed the depths of each of their eyes, and they clicked their tongues in wonder.

They had followed Ye Xijun here to see what sort of person could command her to act on their behalf; seeing him now, they at once realized Yang Kai was not someone to be taken lightly.

“The boy is promising,” they each thought inwardly, but that alone was not enough to win their wholehearted assent; talented young men were many, and only those who truly grew into power were worth admiring.

Yang Kai, however, glanced at Ye Xijun with some suspicion, not quite understanding why these three had come.

Yet he could guess where they hailed from.

Since they had come together with Ye Xijun, it seemed the matter might indeed hold grand prospects.

“Please sit!” Yang Kai smiled faintly, strode straight to the foremost seat, and took his place; only after settling did he clasp his fists toward the three and say, “I am Yang Kai. Greetings, three seniors. May I ask how you are to be addressed?”

“I am Yang Xiuzhu!”

“I am Lin Yurao!”

“I am Chu Hanyi!”

The three announced their names.

“These three are pillars of the sect, and are well connected within it,” Ye Xijun interjected from the side.

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened. His smile grew even broader.

Being well connected meant that if he could win over these three, he would effectively have won over many of Star Emperor Mountain’s experts; Ye Xijun’s words carried deep significance, and Yang Kai felt suddenly clear-eyed.

“This Senior Yang even shares the same surname as this junior—no wonder that, though it’s our first meeting, I feel such kinship, as if before one of my own elders. I’ll have to trouble Senior for his guidance in the days to come.” Yang Kai said with a smile.

Yang Xiuzhu showed not the slightest response to his words, and even the beautiful woman Lin Yurao and the middle-aged scholar Chu Hanyi regarded him with equal solemnity.

Yang Kai felt wildly embarrassed.

Knowing that these three were not people who could be swayed by mere words, he immediately set that thought aside. Composing himself, he said solemnly, “Since the three Seniors arrived together with the Great Elder, you must already know what this Sect Master intends to do next. I wonder—what are your thoughts on the matter?”

“Sect Master Yang’s intentions for what comes next—we three have already heard of them from our Sect Master,” Yang Xiuzhu said in a deep voice. “But to speak plainly, though Sect Master possesses a powerful warship, that alone may not be enough to take our sect. I wonder—how does Sect Master Yang intend to defend against the strike of an Extinction Thunder Bead?”

“It probably can’t be guarded against!” Yang Kai slowly shook his head.

Though the old man’s attitude could hardly be called friendly, his gaze was razor-sharp, and his words struck straight to the heart.

The blow of an Extinction Thunder Bead was precisely what Yang Kai feared. He had some confidence in his own ability to dodge it, but the warship could not. The vessel was too large; if struck by an Extinction Thunder Bead it could suffer unimaginable damage.

It could even be utterly destroyed.

That had once been a decisive factor in the battle with the Battle Sky Alliance; against Star Emperor Mountain it was of no use.

Unless they forced Star Emperor Mountain to expend the power of the Extinction Thunder Bead, the warship simply could not enter Star Emperor Mountain.

“If it cannot be guarded against, does the Sect Master think that with the likes of you he can take our sect? Our sect has stood on Dark Star for tens of thousands of years; we are not so easily toppled. Is the Sect Master underrating us?” Yang Xiuzhu snorted coldly, clearly unimpressed with Yang Kai’s abilities.

“Heh heh…” Yang Kai wasn’t the least bit unsettled; instead, he chuckled, his expression calm and amiable. “Senior speaks quickly and frankly—then let’s also speak plainly. Just now, I heard Senior refer to the Great Elder as the Sect Master. Yet, as far as I know, Star Emperor Mountain already has another holding that title. It seems that in the eyes of you three Seniors, our Great Elder is the one truly worthy of that position.”

Yang Xiuzhu nodded readily. “Indeed! Ever since that traitor took over the position of Sect Master a hundred years ago, he’s done nothing but suppress and persecute those who opposed him. Anyone who refused to obey was targeted. The three of us have lived bitterly under his rule—forced to seek out our own cultivation materials and wasting years of training. Before, we believed the true Sect Master had long perished, and so we endured. But now that we know the Sect Master still lives in this world, it’s only natural that we follow her lead.”

“Such loyalty is truly admirable. This junior holds the utmost respect for the integrity of you three Seniors!” Yang Kai said solemnly.

“Save the formalities. The only reason we came is because of the Sect Master; it has nothing to do with you. Let me be blunt: even if you persuade us, we will not directly take up arms to help. After so long we have avoided violence; we do not wish to stain our hands with blood, especially the blood of fellow disciples.”

Lin Yurao and Chu Hanyi nodded in agreement.

“Then why did you come?” Yang Kai asked, surprised and displeased.

“If the Sect Master can persuade us, for the sake of the Sect Master we might lend assistance within our means,” Lin Yurao replied.

“Within your means?” Yang Kai’s brow knit.

“For example… persuading some sect members not to take up arms against you.”

“How many?” Yang Kai raised an eyebrow.

“About half.”

“Well, that’s decent…” Yang Kai pondered. If half refused to oppose him, the situation would improve greatly; moreover, with that half serving as a restraint, the rest would be less likely to act rashly.

“All our fellow disciples were raised within Star Emperor Mountain and are as close as brothers and sisters. Most still uphold the same principles as the true Sect Master—those who have turned against them are but a few. With the support of us three, and the weight of the Sect Master’s former prestige, Sect Master Yang’s endeavor this time may well have a chance of success,” Yang Xiuzhu added.

“Hm, you have a point. How then should I persuade you?” Yang Kai looked toward the three.

“That’s something only Sect Master Yang can answer,” the beautiful woman Lin Yurao said with a faint smile.

“Understood.” Yang Kai lightly nodded, brows creasing as he pondered.

From Ye Xijun’s prior descriptions and this meeting, it seemed many within Star Emperor Mountain lived removed from the world. Growing up inside the sect and rarely contacting the outside, their implanted doctrines and upbringing left them with little greed.

Thus to move them, wealth was likely useless; one must instead appeal to their preferences.

Moreover, whatever proposal he made could not endanger the other members of Star Emperor Mountain—otherwise, it would surely stir their resentment.

After a moment of thought, a smile of confidence spread across Yang Kai’s face.

Noticing the change in his expression, Yang Xiuzhu and the others furrowed their brows, curious as to what Yang Kai had in mind, and turned their full attention to him.

“The three of you are already experts at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm. Have you not thought of advancing further upon the Martial Dao?” Yang Kai asked with a smile, looking at them.

“Advancing further?!” Their expressions all stirred, eyes wide as they stared at Yang Kai and asked eagerly, “You have a method?”

There isn’t a cultivator alive who doesn’t wish to keep advancing on the Martial Dao. Once one sets foot upon this path, they can only keep moving forward, striving to glimpse ever greater horizons—no one is willing to stand still.

“Heh, I of course lack the power to break the restrictions of the Dark Star’s laws, but the three seniors have seen that I own a Void King-Grade Warship. Frankly, after these matters are concluded I intend to make a long voyage,” Yang Kai said calmly.

“A long voyage?” Their eyes lit up. They understood at once and looked expectant. “You mean…?”

“Precisely. If Dark Star’s laws bind you, then leave this place. I do not mean to boast; I believe with a Void King-Grade Warship of such quality, a long voyage is entirely feasible. I have even invited Elder Qian of Yingyue Hall, City Lord Fei, and people from Qiantian Sect. If the three seniors are willing, you may come along!”

Yang Xiuzhu and the others grew excited, seeming ready to accept immediately.

Success! Yang Kai grinned broadly.

But very quickly he noticed something amiss. The three’s excitement dissipated at great speed; they frowned and bore looks of guilt.

“Is there something unsatisfactory about this proposal?” Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

Yang Xiuzhu glanced at him and forced a wry smile. “Sect Master Yang, you jest. Such an opportunity—what Third Stage Origin Returning Realm cultivator would refuse? The attraction for us would be unimaginable. But… if we agreed to help you because of this offer, we would be seen as traitors selling out the sect for gain. Please understand, Sect Master Yang: we cannot accept your aid in that manner.”

Damn, stubborn old fools! Yang Kai cursed inwardly.

Even at a time like this, the old man was still thinking of his fellow disciples. In a sense, Yang Kai truly admired his character—but from the standpoint of his own goals and interests, the old man’s attitude was simply incomprehensible.

Fortunately, the proposal Yang Kai had prepared was not a single option.

Drawing a deep breath, Yang Kai said in a grave voice, “I heard from the Great Elder that Star Emperor Mountain is a branch of the Taixuan Sect. I will not hide this: the place where our Lingxiao Sect stands is in fact the ruins of the Taixuan Sect!”

At this, Yang Xiuzhu opened his mouth, but no words followed; he sighed heavily instead.

He had no ability to reclaim his ancestors’ legacy now occupied by others; he had no grounds to reproach Yang Kai.

“What do you mean by that, Sect Master Yang?” Chu Hanyi frowned.

“What if I were to say that once this matter is settled, all those of Star Emperor Mountain could return to Taixuan Sect?” Yang Kai said with a sly grin. “Since you have guarded your ancestors’ precepts for tens of thousands of years, I imagine you must long to see your ancestral land again. I can grant you that wish—and not only that, you could live there from then on, in the very place your forebears once dwelled. You’d breathe the same air they breathed, behold the same sights they once saw. After all, that’s the very place where even the Great Emperor once resided—who knows, there may yet be hidden mysteries waiting there.”
