## Chapter 578 — Hurry and Marry Me

“Brother Ling…” Meng Wuya was startled; Ling Taixu’s words instantly made him realize something.

Ling Taixu was clearly intent on risking everything to fight Yang Bai, but although he possessed cultivation at the Transcendent Realm, Second Stage, against Yang Bai, there was only a path to death.

Ling Taixu still harbored deep resentment over having once trained Yang Bai. Since he could not destroy him, then he would be the one to destroy himself — this was probably Ling Taixu’s reasoning.

After discerning this, Meng Wuya’s expression grew grave.

Over all these years, Shopkeeper Meng had few close friends. Xiao Fusheng of the Hidden Cloud Peak in Yao Wang Valley barely qualified, and apart from that, only Ling Taixu remained. Though his relationship with Yang Kai was good, Yang Kai was the junior of the two. Now that his old friend was going to a deadly mission, Meng Wuya naturally could not turn a blind eye.

“Since Brother Ling has this resolve, then we shall head together to Zhongdu. It is better to watch over each other,” said Meng Wuya.

“Brother Meng…” Ling Taixu looked touched.

“I will come as well, to ensure your safety,” Meng Wuya said with a faint smile, then looked at Yang Kai. “When do you plan to depart?”

“Let’s wait a little longer. The four Blood Servants brought by Eldest Brother and Second Brother are currently at a crucial juncture. Once they break through, we shall leave,” Yang Kai replied.

At that time, thirteen Blood Servants at the Transcendent Realm, plus Meng Wuya, Ling Taixu, Di Mo, and Li Yuanchun would comprise an unprecedentedly powerful lineup.

Furthermore, today Lü Si was brought along. He too was a Transcendent Realm powerhouse.

This strength, while not enough to completely pacify the chaos in Zhongdu, would be sufficient to guarantee their own safety under Yang Kai’s plan. Unless the Evil Lord Yang Bai was willing to unleash all-out attack upon them.

After the arrangements were made, Yang Kai rushed out to inform Lü Si. When Lü Si heard that Yang Kai was willing to lead people to Zhongdu, he was overjoyed to the point of being speechless, repeatedly praising Yang Kai’s grasp of righteousness and the bigger picture, declaring that the Lü Family was willing to follow him.

For several peaceful days, the four Blood Servants brought by Yang Wei and Yang Zhao remained in seclusion, attempting to break through the Transcendent Realm. Half a year had passed since their arrival. In the first three months, Yang Kai had vigorously trained them, using the Wan Yao Ling Ye to cleanse their meridians and marrow, allowing them to ascend to Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

In the subsequent three months, he gave them Wan Yao Ling Paste, aiding their breakthrough to the Transcendent Realm. Now, they were close to success.

During this time, the Lü Family also rested at the mansion.

Everything in the mansion astonished Lü Si and his companions.

About eighty percent of the warriors coming and going were at the Divine Roaming Realm, and the remaining twenty percent, even if not at that level, were at least at Eighth Stage of the True Yuan Realm.

Many of those were young disciples!

Youngsters under twenty had already reached this level. Lü Si was equally shocked and envious.

In the Lü Family, having someone at True Yuan Realm at twenty was considered talent, needing substantial cultivation. But here, True Yuan Realm was nothing to write home about.

Nine Transcendent Realm Blood Servants, plus four other top-tier Transcendent Realm experts, made this mansion’s power far beyond any of the Zhongdu Eight Great Families.

The Lü Family members acted very reserved during these few days.

After witnessing the might and formation inside Yang Kai’s mansion, they felt their own Lü Family was pitifully small, like a minor clan. They dared not be reckless.

Seven days later, a sudden burst of soaring energy erupted.

The grand celestial phenomenon reappeared, and Lü Si rushed out of his room, staring blankly at the massive energy gathering in the sky, lips trembling.

Someone had broken through beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!

And it wasn’t just one person!

Two people advanced simultaneously!

But that was not all. Two more powerful auras burst forth.

Lü Si was dumbfounded.

Li Yuanchun of the overseas Tai Yi Sect had appeared beside him, gazing at the sky together. He sighed gently, “This is nothing. You haven’t seen nine people consecutively breaking through beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.”

His tone full of bittersweetness.

Lü Si looked at him and politely asked, “May I ask your name?”

“Li Yuanchun of the Tai Yi Sect.”

“Tai Yi Sect?” Lü Si was surprised. “Is that the Tai Yi Sect, that superpower?”

Li Yuanchun awkwardly waved his hand. “Brother Lü, you exaggerate. Don’t mention superpowers here. Compared to Young Master Yang’s mansion, Ha… it’s incomparable.”

Lü Si nodded deeply in agreement. It wasn’t just Tai Yi Sect incomparable to Yang Kai’s mansion, but the Eight Great Families as well.

This was truly the most elite force under heaven! Far beyond anything any sect or clan in history could boast.

“Brother Lü, do you have a granddaughter?” Li Yuanchun suddenly asked out of the blue.

“I have devoted myself to cultivation all my life with no direct descendants,” Lü Si answered perplexed, not understanding the question.

“Your Lü Family is a first-tier clan; you must have many young and beautiful women, right?”

“There are indeed quite a few.”

“Then hurry and marry one of them off. I truly envy your inland sects. Such a young prodigy has appeared here, and if you don’t build connections now, Brother Lü, when will you? If Tai Yi Sect were inland, never mind granddaughters, even daughters, I would hand them over to Young Master Yang.”

Lü Si’s face darkened. He thought: Li Yuanchun was old. If he had a daughter, she would be at least forty or fifty. Isn’t this like an old ox eating tender grass? Would Yang Kai be pleased?

Thinking this, Lü Si fell into thought. What Li Yuanchun said wasn’t entirely unreasonable.

The Lü Family had plenty of young, beautiful girls, each graceful and delicious to the eye. If even one caught the attention of Yang Kai, the Lü Family would gain a much stronger backing than the Eight Great Families.

After all, Yang Kai was still young. Who in their youth was without charm? Men were powerless in the face of beauty! Lü Si had gone through that phase too, so as he contemplated, his expression grew ambiguous.

Clearly, Li Yuanchun’s words had stirred some desire.

The four Blood Servants’ breakthrough lasted fully four days.

After four days, calm returned, and all emerged from seclusion at the Transcendent Realm level.

Yang Kai then gave them three days to consolidate their cultivation. Tu Feng and the others shared their insights gained recently, as well as experiences received from Meng Wuya, benefiting the four Blood Servants greatly, allowing them quick comprehension of the mysteries and tier divisions within the Transcendent Realm.

All was ready.

Yang Kai intended to lead thirteen Blood Servants, Di Mo, Li Yuanchun, and the Lü Family members to Zhongdu.

But a certain statement by Meng Wuya left him momentarily stunned.

“I can bring everyone in the mansion to Zhongdu.”

“How?” Yang Kai was shocked.

Meng Wuya’s smile was inscrutable. He waved his hand, sending beams of mysterious light into the void, which disappeared quickly, and Heavenly Journey Palace reappeared, a transparent palace formation barrier wrapping the entire mansion.

On that barrier shimmered intricate formation runes — complicated and wondrous.

“Lift off!” Meng Wuya shouted.

With a huge hum and tremble, the entire Yang Kai mansion rose from the ground. Protected by Heavenly Journey Palace’s defense, not a single tile was damaged. Slowly it ascended like a small island moving in the sky.

“Th-this…” Everyone was stunned.

Feeling themselves rising, the warriors rushed to the mansion’s edges to look down, reacting as if discovering a new continent, clamoring excitedly.

Even the Transcendent Realm experts present were deeply shocked by the display of power Meng Wuya had demonstrated.

“I never said Heavenly Journey Palace couldn’t move, did I?” Meng Wuya looked triumphantly at Yang Kai, clearly enjoying his bafflement.

“I’ve been played,” Yang Kai smiled wryly.

No wonder when Yang Kai proposed going to Zhongdu that day, Meng Wuya did not oppose it and even supported it, claiming he could guarantee everyone’s safety.

Yang Kai had wondered why Meng Wuya would abandon Xia Ningshang, yet want to come along to Zhongdu.

By Meng Wuya’s principles, only Xia Ningshang’s absolute safety mattered, so such passion was unusual. Now it was clear—he had a plan.

Heavenly Journey Palace could move, acting as an impenetrable defensive barrier. Yang Kai’s prior worries vanished instantly.

“This is even better!” Yang Kai quickly came to his senses and grinned, looking at Meng Wuya. “Shopkeeper Meng, thank you for your hard work.”

“Stop with the snide remarks!” Meng Wuya replied with a weary look, continuously channeling beams of light into the formation barrier. It was clear moving Heavenly Journey Palace thus required great effort.

“Ha ha ha ha!” Yang Kai laughed heartily.

On the ground, Shan Qingluo and Biluo stared wide-eyed at the mansion soaring up, slowly moving toward Zhongdu, stunned for a long while.

“How is this done?” Biluo muttered.

Previously she was injured by Transcendent Realm experts, but recovered quickly. Shan Qingluo had since taken her away from Yang Kai’s mansion.

“I don’t know,” Shan Qingluo said. This scene was beyond her knowledge and understanding.

“Lady, what shall we do now?” Biluo asked.

“Go to Zhongdu. There’s no reason to stay here.”

She and Biluo only stayed because Yang Bai wanted her to monitor Yang Kai’s mansion. Now that it had taken flight, she naturally would not remain.

Saying this, her delicate figure turned to a streak of light, swiftly catching up to Yang Kai’s mansion, calling out, “Yang Kai, I’m heading to Zhongdu to report the situation to the Evil Lord.”

Hearing her shout, Yang Kai shook his head and ordered, “Di Mo, stop her.”

Di Mo scratched his head. “Can someone else do it? I don’t really want to.”

Yang Kai’s relationship with Shan Qingluo was ambiguous, but anyone could see the Enchantress Queen bore no hostility towards him, but rather had a liking. Yang Kai’s attitude toward her was also quite ambiguous.

Her deliberate call-out was clearly to make Yang Kai send someone to stop her.

Stopping her without injuring her was a thankless task, so Di Mo was naturally reluctant.

Yang Kai gave him a glare, and Di Mo quickly said, “At your command,” then frowned as he rushed out of the mansion to intercept Shan Qingluo.
