## Chapter 2274 — This Is Two

That black hole was initially tiny, but in the blink of an eye it roared open, as if about to swallow heaven and earth, filling people with a terrifying sense of impending doom.

Darkness descended, plunging the world into blackness.

In the boundless dark, something seemed to be rapidly taking shape...

Gao Shan and Liu Shui bore the brunt of it, feeling dark emotions in their hearts suddenly become tangible and surge up, making their eyes tremble with a malevolent light. That darkness seemed able to devour a person's mind, dragging them forever down the demonic path.

"Not good!" Gao Shan shouted, biting the tip of his tongue and spitting out a mouthful of Essence-Blood, forcing himself to suppress his dark thoughts and barely hold on.

Liu Shui did the same; both wore strained, ugly expressions. It was clear they couldn't resist this technique for long before their minds were corrupted and they became demons.

At this critical moment, a deep, solemn voice echoed through the world.

The sound was infinitely intricate, seeming both near and far, ethereal and elusive, impossible to grasp. As the voice rang out, a ray of light burst from the darkness.

The light enveloped a figure floating in midair, hands forming seals, lips moving as she chanted an unknown incantation.

All the martial artists who heard the chant felt as if an invisible hand brushed across their hearts, washing away the surging darkness and restoring clarity to their minds.

"It's her!" Yang Kai stood not far away, his expression strange as he looked at the faintly glowing figure in the sky—Ye Qinghan.

No one knew what technique she was using, but it had a powerful effect of calming and purifying the mind, instantly pulling countless martial artists back from the edge of despair.

Once everyone regained their senses, no one dared linger. They all used their movement techniques to escape the shroud of darkness. Gao Shan and Liu Shui, having glimpsed a sliver of hope, also fled quickly, not forgetting to bring Ning Yuanshu along.

Ye Qinghan's cultivation was only at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Even though her technique could restrain the darkness, she couldn't maintain it for long. After just ten breaths her face turned pale, the light around her faded, and she collapsed from exhaustion, falling from the sky, about to perish.

At the crucial moment, Hua Qingsi flung out a red ribbon, wrapping it around Ye Qinghan and pulling her out of the darkness. Then, together with Liu Yan, they took her and Zhang Ruoxi and fled without looking back.

Using spatial secret techniques, Yang Kai teleported away in an instant.

He could no longer rely on any of the martial artists here; he could only depend on himself. The most important thing now was to recover his strength as quickly as possible.

Not long after Yang Kai left, the Artifact Spirit finally put away its warhammer. The darkness dissipated, and it looked around. The surroundings were empty, not a single person in sight. It quickly locked its gaze on the direction Yang Kai had escaped, hefted its warhammer, and gave chase.

Yuqing Mountain was only about ten thousand li from Fenglin City.

Once, a Divine Spirit named Luanfeng had appeared here, unleashing a World-Ending Black Flame that burned vast stretches of forest. Even after nearly two years, the World-Ending Black Flame still showed no sign of extinguishing and continued to blaze on the mountain.

That area had become a wasteland, with nothing growing within a hundred li. All that remained was the endless black flame.

Although this place was desolate and ruined, it had become a Sacred Land for many martial artists who cultivated fire-type techniques.

Many martial artists who specialized in fire-type techniques traveled thousands of li to this place to comprehend the mysterious power within the World-Ending Black Flame. After all, this was the true flame left behind by an Ancient Divine Spirit, possessing boundless might. If one could refine even a trace, they would benefit for life.

Yang Kai had long heard that many fire-type martial artists gathered in Yuqing Mountain. He had even thought about bringing Liu Yan here to absorb some of the flame. Since Liu Yan could refine even a feather from Luanfeng, there was no reason she couldn't handle the World-Ending Black Flame.

He had thought about it, but had been too busy lately to find the time.

Using spatial secret techniques repeatedly, Yang Kai arrived at Yuqing Mountain in a short while, reaching the area ravaged by Luanfeng.

Looking around, he saw that quite a few martial artists had gathered here, each with a violent, scorching aura, clearly cultivators of fire-type techniques or secret arts.

Sensing Yang Kai's arrival, many people opened their eyes to glance at him, then lost interest.

Yang Kai swept the area with his Divine Sense, and his expression darkened.

He found there weren't any truly strong martial artists here—most were at the Void King or Origin Returning Realms. Dao Origin Realm martial artists were few, and those present were only at the First Stage—not much help.

He had hoped to rely on these martial artists to help block the Artifact Spirit, but now it seemed that plan was doomed.

But soon, Yang Kai's eyes lit up as he stared at the center of the burning black flame.

There, in a roughly ten zhang-wide area, was a safe zone untouched by the black flame.

After thinking for a moment, he warned, "Everyone, danger is about to arrive here. If you don't want to die, you'd better leave quickly."

As soon as he spoke, the martial artists all woke from meditation, opened their eyes, and looked at him with displeasure.

Someone even sneered and threatened, "Kid, what did you just say? If you've got guts, say it again."

The speaker saw that Yang Kai was young and assumed his cultivation wasn't high, so he didn't take him seriously.

Yang Kai glanced at the man and smiled, "I was clear. I'm advising everyone for your own good."

"Kid, you just want to monopolize this divine flame, don't you?" an old man said coldly, "Young man, you should know that helping others is helping yourself. This divine flame covers a hundred li; you can sit anywhere and comprehend its mysteries. Why stir up trouble? Even if you're strong, remember that two fists can't beat four hands. I advise you to restrain yourself and stop talking nonsense."

Yang Kai wiped his sweat and said, "I have no intention of comprehending the mysteries of this divine flame. Danger really is coming soon. If you don't leave now, it'll be too late."

"What danger!" a tall martial artist at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm snorted. Yang Kai had never seen this man before and didn't know if he was an outsider, but recently many outsiders had appeared in Fenglin City, so it wasn't surprising. The man shouted angrily, "Kid, stop trying to scare us, or don't blame me for being rude!"

Hearing this, Yang Kai's expression changed. He frowned and sensed the area, then smiled bitterly, "Well, now it's too late for you to leave even if you want to."

"What?"

"Kid, you dare threaten us? Believe it or not, I'll skin you alive!"

"Outrageous! This kid really doesn't respect anyone. He needs to be taught a lesson."

As the crowd angrily argued, a sound of something breaking through the air suddenly rang out. The Artifact Spirit's figure appeared not far away, stunning everyone. They all looked at it suspiciously, but when they sensed the violent, evil aura within its body, their expressions changed—they finally realized Yang Kai hadn't been lying.

"Run! What are you still sitting here for? Do you want to die?" Yang Kai shouted.

As soon as he spoke, everyone's faces changed. The Artifact Spirit was clearly not someone to mess with, and its aura was almost comparable to the Emperor Realm. No one dared hesitate; they all got up and fled in every direction.

The Artifact Spirit ignored everyone else, seemingly uninterested in them. It just stood there staring at Yang Kai, its crimson eyes shining with extreme evil.

In no time, all the martial artists who had been comprehending the mysteries of the black flame had left.

Yang Kai grinned at the Artifact Spirit and said, "I'm really curious—just how much intelligence do you have?" As he spoke, he raised a finger and asked, "Do you know what number this is?"

The Artifact Spirit was indifferent.

Yang Kai laughed, "It's two, you idiot!"

As soon as he finished speaking, the Artifact Spirit raised its warhammer. Seeing this, Yang Kai's expression changed slightly. He darted into the safe zone surrounded by black flame, laughing wildly, "Come hit me! If you've got guts, come in and hit me!"

Maybe Yang Kai's words provoked it, because as soon as he finished, the Artifact Spirit really charged at him.

But as soon as it stepped into the burning black flame, it seemed to be stung by something and quickly retreated.

Several tiny black flames clung to its pitch-black body. Though small, the flames burned fiercely and wouldn't go out.

Luanfeng's black flame could burn anything in the world. Even an Imperial Treasure would melt into molten iron if placed within it.

However, the black flame here had been burning for a long time and lacked Luanfeng's true body, so its power was much weaker.

Even so, it wouldn't be extinguished easily.

The Artifact Spirit sensed danger and kept pouring out power, trying to extinguish the flames, but couldn't do it. Its mood grew more and more agitated.

Then it picked up the Demonic Warhammer and started smashing at itself.

With one strike, a buzzing sound rang out, and the power of the artifact surged violently.

Yang Kai's eyes narrowed in shock, "So ruthless!"

Although the Artifact Spirit was born from the Demonic Warhammer, smashing itself like this could easily cause unpredictable consequences. Clearly, the Artifact Spirit lacked intelligence and was just acting on impulse.

But this actually worked.

The black flames struck by the warhammer dimmed considerably.

Seeing this, the Artifact Spirit tilted its head and thought for a while, then decided it had found a way and kept smashing the burning spots on its body with the warhammer.

Yang Kai watched coldly from the sidelines. Seeing that the Artifact Spirit would likely be busy for quite a while, he finally relaxed, snorting coldly, "Take your time playing around. In a bit, this Young Master will teach you a proper lesson!"
