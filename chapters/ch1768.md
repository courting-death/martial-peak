## Chapter 1768 — Spatial Spiral

The boundless void stretched on without edge, yet specks of starlight dotted its depths, arrayed in a spiral; at the very center of that spiral, a terrifying fluctuation of power surged and fell.

Yang Kai and Xue Yue stood side by side above the enormous spiral formed of countless Ethereal Crystals, their expressions both unusually grave.

They had discovered many Ethereal Crystals here beforehand, and had rushed over eagerly; but upon arriving, Yang Kai found the place to be very strange.

The Ethereal Crystals were still the same Ethereal Crystals, yet, drawn by some unknown force, they had arranged themselves into a peculiar formation—a spiral!

Even Xue Yue, who was not versed in spatial power, could sense a dangerous aura emanating from the center of that spiral, as if there lay the root of something capable of devouring everything.

This was already a rift in the void, yet the very center of the spiral seemed to be an eerie existence capable of swallowing even that fissure.

"Yang Kai…" Xue Yue whispered in Yang Kai's ear, "I'm a little anxious."

"That's normal, I'm a little too," Yang Kai replied reassuringly; it was an instinctive fear of the power radiating from the spiral—no one could avoid it—"but… this thing seems to be of great use to me."

"What do you intend to do?" Xue Yue asked, staring at him in astonishment.

Yang Kai frowned deeply, pondered for a long moment, then tapped Xue Yue's hand and said, "Help me gather those Ethereal Crystals first."

Xue Yue looked at him intently; her bright eyes seemed to look straight into Yang Kai's heart and see his thoughts. After a while she nodded submissively, "Mm."

As she spoke, she had already flown out to the Ethereal Crystals scattered beyond the spiral, collecting them one by one.

Yang Kai remained where he stood, staring fixedly at the very center of the spiral. His expression was more solemn than it had ever been.

After a long while he released his Divine Sense and probed toward the center of the spiral.

He had intended to pry into the mysteries concealed within that spiral, but when his Divine Sense made contact, he was horrified to discover an astonishing and dreadful attraction pouring out from the spiral.

The pull was unbelievably strong; in an instant it tugged at Yang Kai's mind and dragged it inward.

Not only that, his body standing where it was felt gripped by an invisible hand and vanished; when it reappeared he was already at the very center of the spiral.

"Yang Kai!" Xue Yue cried out in alarm.

But she received no response from Yang Kai.

From where she stood, Yang Kai only appeared to be standing motionless in the center of the spiral, as if he had lost all awareness of the outside and showed no reaction.

She called to him several times in succession, yet Yang Kai remained unmoved.

She instantly knew Yang Kai had encountered something; she dared not act rashly and could only stand there burning with anxiety, gazing toward him and silently praying for his safety.

……

Spinning—endless spinning—Yang Kai felt as though his body and soul were being torn apart; the unbearable pain left him wanting to cry out, yet no sound would come from his mouth.

The moment he was pulled into that spiral, his mind entered a repeated rotation; it felt as if he had been swept into a raging tornado, forced to passively endure the ravages of that rotation with no means of resistance.

His Sea of Consciousness churned; Yang Kai felt dizzy as if his soul were being flung out of his body by the rotational force.

Since his cultivation had reached fruition he had seldom encountered situations that left him at a loss; at any crisis he could quickly devise reasonable countermeasures to resolve imminent danger.

But this time he found himself somewhat powerless.

While the spiral's pull dragged at him and his mind kept rotating, he was shocked to find his Sea of Consciousness drying up at a rate visible to the naked eye; looking inward at his body, the flesh he had once taken pride in also began to show countless wounds.

He forced himself to stir his Saint Yuan and employ Divine Sense in an attempt to break free from the spiral's strange power.

To no avail! He felt as if he had sunk into a quagmire; the more he struggled, the deeper he sank.

In less than a dozen breaths his Sea of Consciousness had already withered!

Damage to his soul power left Yang Kai with a splitting headache.

In his Sea of Consciousness the Warm Spirit Lotus, which shed seven-colored radiance, now played a crucial role; when his Sea of Consciousness was drained it immediately began to nourish his soul and mend the damaged parts.

The restorative nourishment from the Warm Spirit Lotus cleared Yang Kai’s mind for a brief moment.

In that instant he suddenly experienced something unusual—the spiral's force, while destroying his body and Divine Sense power, was also imposing another kind of power upon him.

It was Spatial Force!

This granted him, in a very short time, a new insight into the mysteries of Spatial Force.

Yang Kai was overjoyed and, forcing himself to endure the intolerable pain, calmed his mind to feel it.

A flash of understanding dawned on him.

At a certain moment he resolutely gave up resisting and allowed the spiral's power to fling his soul from his body in the rotation.

In an instant a different field of vision opened before his eyes!

It felt as if his soul had left his body; his spirit hovered in the void, invisible and formless, yet able to see all that was visible.

He clearly saw his body still standing quietly at the center of the spiral, countless Ethereal Crystals around it emitting faint light, while Xue Yue stood not far off, calling his name over and over.

Her beauty, capable of staggering the masses, was filled with anxiety; panic brimmed in her bright eyes and her face had turned pale.

Yang Kai tried to send a Divine Sense to her, but Xue Yue did not notice at all and continued to shout in a shrill voice.

He did not persist, for he knew this state was not truly soul-departure; affected by the spatial power here, his thoughts could not be transmitted to Xue Yue.

He refocused his attention back onto the spiral.

From this vantage he saw more and gained more.

After a while he thoughtfully stirred his Spatial Force and released it following the direction of the spiral's power.

The pressure eased considerably! Whether from the soul or the body, Yang Kai suddenly felt much lighter.

He was struck by sudden comprehension.

The spiral's power was, it turned out, an extraordinarily profound spatial power—far more advanced than what he had grasped; before such an absolute gulf in realm, any resistance was futile and would only multiply the pain.

Only by following the spiral's trajectory to comprehend it could one sense and penetrate this higher realm. It was like copying the shape of an object: though one might temporarily attain the form without the spirit, there would still be some gain; with perseverance the essence could eventually be understood.

Having realized this, Yang Kai no longer hesitated and began without reserve to stir his Spatial Force, aligning the operation of his own spatial power with the spiral's trajectory.

It was an extremely arduous process, and an exceedingly slow one.

Countless cracks began to appear on Yang Kai's body, golden blood seeping from the wounds; yet it did not spill but seemed to writhe like a living thing, repairing the injuries.

His exceptionally robust body was crucial at this time, allowing him to endure for a long period.

Time slipped by bit by bit; Yang Kai sank completely into this strange comprehension and forgot all else.

As time passed, the Spatial Force radiating from his body did not weaken; on the contrary it grew stronger and purer, gradually coinciding more perfectly with the spiral's trajectory.

He felt little of the former pressure.

His own spatial power and the spiral's force began to merge so that the rotational impact on him became negligible.

Until, at a certain moment, the two forces overlapped perfectly!

At that instant the entire void seemed to hum.

Yang Kai felt an extremely strange sensation—he discovered he seemed to have become that vast spiral, the two fused into one, indistinguishable.

Light bloomed generously around him; along the spiral's outward extension, the countless Ethereal Crystals all burst forth with dazzling brilliance and, under an inexplicable profound intent, exploded.

The bursting Ethereal Crystals did not collapse the void; instead they transformed into threads of fine energy and streamed along the spiral's path toward the center.

Those energies were countless and dense, all like black lines, beyond reckoning.

And at the spiral's center stood Yang Kai's body.

All those black-thread energies produced by the exploded Ethereal Crystals poured en masse into Yang Kai's body and then vanished.

The blinding light gradually faded; the void returned to darkness and no trace of light remained, and the spiral's power disappeared as well.

Yang Kai, who had stood there the whole time, only then had the chance to carefully inspect his body.

When he extended his Divine Sense he could not help but frown.

He found his body in a strange state: faint black lines shimmered across his skin, and when the lines appeared he looked as if a portion of his flesh had vanished; when the lines receded the missing flesh returned.

Flesh did not vanish for no reason; it was merely a visual interference caused by the overwhelmingly strong spatial power—an interference capable of swallowing both sight and Divine Sense probes.

Even Yang Kai himself could not dispel this interference; perhaps only after he had fully mastered the power could he eliminate it.

Yet at this moment he had never felt better; this accident had allowed him to absorb and fuse almost the entire profound intent embedded in the spatial spiral and the strength of more than a thousand pure Ethereal Crystals, raising his comprehension of Spatial Force to a brand-new level—an elevation he had never before dared to hope for.

Overjoyed, he meticulously sensed the changes within him.

The more he reflected, the more he realized his previous understanding of spatial power had been shallow; the deeper he probed the Domain of Spatial Force the more terrifying the techniques one could wield became.
