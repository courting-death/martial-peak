## Chapter 2104 — Fiery Red Light

Several thousand li away in Fenglin City, the tens of thousands of martial artists no longer felt joy at surviving the disaster; instead they all looked in terror toward a certain direction.

From that direction, violent energy fluctuations were coming, accompanied by deafening explosions.

Duan Yuanshan, Drunken Old Man, Qin Chaoyang, and the Dao Origin Realm Patriarchs of each great family all stood atop the city wall, their gazes piercing the void, as if trying to discern something.

“City Lord, who is fighting over there?” Liang Pengle, the Liang Family Patriarch, asked in shock.

Duan Yuanshan paused briefly and said, "On my way back I encountered Lord Chen of the Tianwu Sacred Land and two other lords; it seems they are the ones making the commotion."

“Master Chen Wenhao, who visited our Fenglin City last time?” Xin Gaojie, the Xin Family Patriarch, narrowed his eyes.

“Exactly!”

“Then who is their enemy?” Xin Gaojie asked, his face full of shock.

Chen Wenhao and the other two are all Emperor Realm experts. Even with the three joining forces, they are only able to fight that unknown enemy to a standstill, shaking the heavens and earth, unable to claim victory in the shortest time.

This shows just how formidable that enemy is.

“I don’t know!” Duan Yuanshan shook his head.

Yet at that moment, Yang Kai’s figure inexplicably surfaced in his mind.

Back then, seven Dao Origin Realm experts took Qin Yu to repair the seal, but a mishap occurred. Zhuang Pan fled in the heat of battle, the Black Tortoise Seven-Section Formation collapsed without being attacked, Du Lishen died tragically on the spot, and Qin Chaoyang was severely wounded and fell unconscious.

Yang Kai was eroded by Demonic Qi, standing motionless, seemingly about to become a demon...

If Yang Kai lost his mind and became a demon, it was possible.

But with his foundation, even if he became a demon, could he really contend with three Emperor Realm experts?

Duan Yuanshan shook his head, dispelling the absurd thought.

Moreover, the strange ancient Demonic Qi had already vanished, and the demonized creatures had recovered. Yang Kai should be the same.

Rumble...

Suddenly, a thunderous sound rang out in the sky. With its appearance, the world’s energy seemed to be drawn, rapidly converging toward a certain direction.

“What’s happening?” Xin Gaojie was the first to react, looking in astonishment toward a certain part of Fenglin City.

Duan Yuanshan also turned his head. After watching for a moment, he exclaimed with joy, “Someone in the city is about to advance to the Dao Origin Realm! Whose disciple is it?”

The Patriarchs looked at each other and slowly shook their heads, indicating it wasn’t one of their own.

“Let’s go see. This is a sign of prosperity for our Fenglin City after its great disaster!” Duan Yuanshan called out, amplifying his voice with Origin Qi so that all martial artists in the city could hear clearly.

As the city lord, he naturally had to stabilize people’s hearts at this moment, and this advancement was the perfect opportunity.

No matter who was advancing, being able to trigger a change in the world’s energy at this time was a good thing for the survivors of Fenglin City.

Soon, everyone rushed to the finest cave residence.

Outside the cave, an old woman, a beautiful middle-aged woman, and a young girl quietly waited.

“Miss Xiaoqi?” Duan Yuanshan glanced at the girl, looking somewhat surprised.

It was normal for him to recognize Mo Xiaoqi, since they had previously fought together against the demonized creatures and Demonic Qi. Although Mo Xiaoqi’s cultivation was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, Duan Yuanshan did not underestimate her.

During that time together, Duan Yuanshan discovered this girl’s origins were quite mysterious, and her skills were profound.

Most crucially, Mo Xiaoqi appeared to be only sixteen or seventeen years old!

A sixteen or seventeen-year-old at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm— even a great sect like Tianwu Sacred Land could hardly nurture such a talent. Only Star God Palace might be able to!

For a while, Duan Yuanshan even thought Mo Xiaoqi was a secret disciple of Star God Palace!

He certainly did not dare to underestimate her.

“City Lord Duan, Seniors.” Mo Xiaoqi smiled slightly and greeted everyone.

“Miss Xiaoqi, the one advancing…” Duan Yuanshan got straight to the point.

“It’s Shopkeeper Kang from the Spiritual Pill Shop,” Mo Xiaoqi answered without hiding anything.

“Kang Siran?” Duan Yuanshan was stunned, and the other Patriarchs also widened their eyes, as if hearing something impossible.

The Spiritual Pill Shop was an industry of the Ziyuan Commerce Guild. The experts mingling in Fenglin City naturally knew it, and also knew of Kang Siran.

But precisely because they knew him well, they were confused.

How could Kang Siran possibly advance to the Dao Origin Realm?

His Martial Dao had already reached its limit, and his aptitude only allowed him to reach the Third Stage of the Void King Realm. It’s not that he could never advance to the Dao Origin Realm, but his chances were one in ten thousand!

Hearing that Kang Siran was the one advancing, everyone was extremely surprised.

A strange look flashed in Duan Yuanshan’s eyes, and he suddenly smiled, “So it’s Shopkeeper Kang. We must offer our congratulations.”

There was a hint of disappointment in his tone.

Although Kang Siran had always lived in Fenglin City, because of his background and identity, he didn’t truly belong to Fenglin City, so his advancement didn’t mean much for the city. That was the reason for Duan Yuanshan’s change in mood.

“Shopkeeper Kang must have obtained some extraordinary opportunity,” Xin Gaojie mused.

Without such an opportunity, with Kang Siran’s aptitude and ability, he could never suddenly advance to the Dao Origin Realm. Judging by the timing, he seemed to have started his closed-door cultivation during the Demonic Qi siege.

Daring to attempt a breakthrough at that time meant Kang Siran was fully confident in his advancement.

“Let’s wait until Shopkeeper Kang comes out, then you Seniors can ask him yourselves,” Mo Xiaoqi replied with a smile.

Duan Yuanshan nodded, “Of course.”

As they spoke, the phenomenon in the sky fully manifested. The power of heaven and earth erupted, and the Baptism of Heaven-and-Earth Energy began. Black clouds transformed into pure attacks, slashing down from the sky, piercing the void, and striking Kang Siran.

From inside the cave, Kang Siran’s howls rang out, as if he was enduring immense pain, making everyone’s scalp tingle.

…

Sword Qi rampaged, Nine Suns enveloped, spear light flashed, transforming into a Jiao, weaving back and forth.

Under the combined assault of the three Emperor Realm experts, Yang Kai's body writhed with Demonic Qi, yet he fought to the death without retreat, as if ignorant of pain; his body was already riddled with wounds.

Injuries inflicted by Emperor Realm Imperial Treasures could not be healed quickly, even with the powerful recovery of Demonic Qi and Golden Blood. The Law Power attached to the attacks eroded the vitality of Yang Kai’s flesh, gradually worsening his wounds.

Bathed in blood, Yang Kai only grew fiercer as he fought.

The three Emperor Realm experts coordinated perfectly. Although they suppressed Yang Kai and kept injuring him, the more they fought, the more shocked they became.

Fortunately, they had arrived together. If any one of them had faced this demon alone, none would have had the confidence to contend with him!

The demon’s ferocity and bloodthirst were the most extreme the three had ever seen.

As the battle reached a stalemate, a piercing bird cry suddenly came from a distant location.

“Lii…”

The clear sound pierced the void, reaching everyone’s ears, as if an Ancient Divine Spirit Phoenix was mourning. The cry contained endless anxiety and fury.

The moment the sound arrived, Yang Kai, who was locked in a life-and-death struggle with the three Emperor Realm experts, suddenly froze, as if struck by lightning. The Demonic Qi around him churned violently.

Seeing this, Chen Wenhao and the others quickly retreated, watching warily. Unsure if Yang Kai was feigning, they dared not advance recklessly.

In a battle between experts, any carelessness could be fatal.

“What was that sound?” Feng Ming asked.

Chen Wenhao and Gao Xueting both slowly shook their heads.

The three looked up and saw Yang Kai suddenly turn to stare in a certain direction.

Following his gaze, they immediately saw a fiery red light speeding toward them from the distant horizon.

“She’s here!”

In the Small Xuan Realm, the Incarnation watched the scene through the image transmission, overjoyed.

“What is that?” Hua Qingsi, even with her full eyesight, still couldn’t see what the fiery red light was, only sensing the terrifying power it contained.

“His Artifact Spirit!” the Incarnation answered.

“Artifact Spirit?” Hua Qingsi frowned, then exclaimed, “Artifact Spirit taking form?”

Artifact Spirits are formless beings, born attached to Secret Treasures and perishing with them.

But this Artifact Spirit could already take form on its own, clearly not an ordinary one.

She suddenly recalled that, according to information she had gathered, more than a year ago at an auction in Fenglin City, a formed Artifact Spirit had been put up for sale.

Could it be this one?

But how could a mere Artifact Spirit turn the tide of this stalemated battle?

Hua Qingsi truly did not understand what on earth that big lump of stone was so pleased about.

“Hopefully… your appearance can awaken the main body’s consciousness!” the Incarnation prayed silently.

Yang Kai, caught in a hopeless battle with three Emperor Realm experts, still refused to retreat. It was not a good sign. The Incarnation had been trying to call out to the main body to make him leave, but no matter what, he couldn’t awaken his consciousness.

At this moment, Liu Yan suddenly arrived. With her spiritual connection to the main body, perhaps something miraculous would happen.

As the Incarnation expected, the moment Liu Yan appeared in the distance, Yang Kai’s Divine Sense fluctuated chaotically. He stood still, staring at the rapidly approaching fiery red light, a trace of confusion flashing in his eyes before he began to struggle violently.

“Li…”

The clear, piercing cry was like a sharp sword stabbing into Yang Kai’s heart. The fiery red light burned like a wildfire in his consciousness, and the inseparable spiritual connection with the Artifact Spirit played a crucial role at that moment.

Yang Kai’s mind suddenly cleared for an instant!

The next moment, he realized the peril he was in, and his brows furrowed.

“The situation has changed, finish this quickly!” Chen Wenhao, seeing Yang Kai’s state, shouted in a low voice, preparing to use his ultimate move to decide the outcome as fast as possible.
