## Chapter 380 — I Guarantee Your Pill Completion

"Two months ago?" Yang Kai furrowed his brow, "I was still in Cangyun Evil Land back then, so naturally, you couldn't see me. I only stayed at Hidden Cloud Peak for two or three months before leaving."

Pausing for a moment, he asked doubtfully, "Elder Si, since you've been to Hidden Cloud Peak, why didn’t you ask Master to help you refine a pill?"

Lü Si forced a bitter smile, "At that time, Yao Wang Valley was in dire straits, and Master Xiao was also in a state of turmoil. I heard from his disciple that he seemed to be researching something. Although I was fortunate enough to visit Hidden Cloud Peak, I didn’t even get to meet Master."

There was no embarrassment on Lü Si's face when he talked about this, only a sense of helplessness.

This was Xiao Fusheng!

Even if his own strength wasn’t very strong and Yao Wang Valley was only a second-rate sect, someone like Lü Si visiting would still be akin to being present yet absent to Xiao Fusheng.

However, Lü Si dared not voice any complaints, still respectfully addressing Xiao Fusheng as Master in his speech!

"I see..." Yang Kai chuckled oddly and then spoke, "What if I could have Master help you refine that Xuan Pill? Would what you said just now still count?"

"You?" Lü Si looked at him with an inexplicable expression and slowly shook his head, "Someone like Master wouldn't listen to you."

Outside, Lü Liang interjected, "Young Master Yang, some boasts shouldn’t be made lightly."

Yang Kai calmly regarded Lü Si, shaking his head again, "Whether it's boasting or not, we won't know without trying. Although I didn’t stay long at Hidden Cloud Peak, requesting Master to help me refine a Xuan Pill is still doable."

Lü Si was stunned, his gaze fixed intensely on Yang Kai, not blinking for a moment.

The others outside, including Lü Liang, were equally astonished. They all knew the great name of Xiao Fusheng. More importantly, they were clearly aware of his current status; even the first person of the Lü Family had been shut out when he went. Why would Xiao Master help Yang Kai refine a Xuan Pill?

This was a middle-level Mystery-Grade Pill, something not to be taken lightly. Even if Xiao Master were to refine it, it would consume considerable effort and time.

"Miss this opportunity and you'll regret it, Elder Si must think carefully," Yang Kai smiled at Lü Si.

Lü Si's expression fluctuated, clearly conflicted inside. He didn’t know whether to believe Yang Kai.

Logically speaking, it shouldn’t be necessary for the Young Master of the Yang Family to deceive him, but he was just a young man. It was normal for young people to brag and show off.

Furrowing his brows in contemplation for a while, Lü Si finally said, "It’s not that I don’t trust Young Master Yang. Since you dare to say this, it must mean you have a certain relationship with Master Xiao."

Yang Kai didn’t deny it, his expression calm.

"Young Master Yang has also stayed at Hidden Cloud Peak for some time, so I would like to ask a few questions." Lü Si clearly wanted to verify whether Yang Kai's words were true.

"Feel free to ask, Elder Si."

Seeing that Yang Kai showed no signs of anxiety, Lü Si nodded slightly, pondering for a moment before asking, "Master Xiao has a disciple; have you ever met her?"

Yang Kai chuckled, "Elder Si didn’t even inquire about the disciple's surname?"

"It seems her surname is Dong, Miss Dong Qingyan, the daughter of the Dong Family."

"The Dong Family is related to the Yang Family by marriage. Dong Qingyan is my cousin!" 

Lü Si was taken aback, suddenly realizing this fact, and exclaimed, "So you’re that Young Master Yang!"

"Which person?" Yang Kai was puzzled for a moment.

"When I went to Hidden Cloud Peak, I heard that Master Xiao set up an examination over half a year ago to accept disciples. There were one male and one female who successfully passed. The young woman was Dong Qingyan, and the male was said to be her guard... But it seems that person is actually you, Young Master Yang!"

"That’s right!" Yang Kai did not deny it, nodding slightly, "But I’m not a disciple of Master."

Everyone from the Lü Family listened, visibly moved.

They never expected that there was such a connection between Yang Kai and Xiao Fusheng. Having passed Xiao Fusheng's test meant that he indeed had a status of a disciple, and with such a master overseeing him, even if he failed in the power struggle within the Yang Family, he wouldn't face major issues in the future; his future would always be bright.

Lü Liang’s gaze flickered, as if he felt he should reassess Yang Kai.

At this moment, Lü Si had already come to believe about eighty percent, but still prudently asked the final question, "I stayed at Hidden Cloud Peak for a few days and had the fortune to see what Master Xiao was researching through Miss Dong; may I ask, Young Master, what exactly was Master researching?"

Yang Kai smiled casually, "A formation!"

It surely concerned pill-refining, something that had vexed Xiao Fusheng.

It must have been the alchemical formation that Yang Kai had entrusted to Xia Ningshang to pass on to Master when he left Hidden Cloud Peak.

Lü Si’s heart jolted; he finally confirmed that the relationship between Yang Kai and Xiao Fusheng was indeed extraordinary. Otherwise, he wouldn’t know these details.

"Should be this kind of formation!" While speaking, Yang Kai casually drew a spirit formation on the ground.

Lü Si immediately held his breath and focused intently on it. The complexity and subtlety of this formation made it hard for him to grasp; even though he had seen it once, he could only recall a small part of it, unable to remember the entirety.

But Yang Kai seemed to draw it effortlessly, clearly already well-versed in it.

"That’s the one!" Lü Si nodded repeatedly. Even after seeing it for the second time, he still couldn’t fully understand it and had to close his eyes and try to recall, but he couldn’t remember much.

After finishing the drawing, Yang Kai casually wiped away the spirit formation and looked up at Lü Si.

At this moment, the reverent expert of the Lü Family finally dared not underestimate Yang Kai any further, realizing that the Xuan Pill would likely depend on the young man before him.

With a mixture of tension and a hint of expectation, Lü Si cautiously inquired, "Young Master Yang, about that Xuan Pill..."

"Give me paper and ink; I can write the letter now!"

"Quickly bring the paper and ink." Lü Si urgently shouted outside, a flush appearing on his old face.

The people outside, stirred by emotions, couldn't help but shudder at Lü Si’s call. Lü Liang hurriedly commanded one person, "Go quickly!"

That person from the Divine Roaming Realm didn’t dare to delay for a moment and transformed into a green light, vanishing from the spot.

In just ten breaths, he returned, holding a writing brush and ink, respectfully walking in to place them before Yang Kai before stepping back politely.

"Young Master Yang, please!" Lü Si personally spread out the paper, dipped the brush in ink, and offered it to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and began to write.

Lü Si watched eagerly, not willing to miss a single word.

The letter Yang Kai wrote was quite straightforward, and the content was as Lü Si thought, requesting Master Xiao to refine a pill for Lü Si.

After finishing, Yang Kai handed it over directly. Lü Si activated his True Yuan, drying the ink, and cautiously folded the letter, placing it within his robe, patting his chest with utmost seriousness, letting out a long breath.

This time, he wouldn't be turned away at the door as he had been last time.

"You needn't laugh, Young Master Yang." After doing all this, Lü Si felt a bit awkward and clasped his hands.

"It’s nothing!"

"I request that Young Master Yang stay at the Lü Family for a few more days. I’ll hurry to Hidden Cloud Peak now; if it really can be refined successfully, I will send the jade bed back!" Lü Si said earnestly.

Yang Kai furrowed his brows, "That won’t do; I need the jade bed now; I still have to return to Zhongdu."

Lü Si's face instantly showed an embarrassed expression, "But that’s a middle-level Mystery-Grade Pill; even if Master Xiao takes action, it doesn’t guarantee it will be refined successfully. If by any chance it fails, I still need that jade bed."

What he said was indeed true. Although Xiao Fusheng could refine upper-level Mystery-Grade Pills, no one could guarantee the results of pill refining. Maybe this time Master Xiao wouldn’t be in the best state and wouldn’t succeed.

If it came to that, and the jade bed was gone, Lü Si would have nowhere to cry.

"How about this, you help me bring something to Master that guarantees the pill will succeed!" Yang Kai furrowed his brow in thought and raised his voice to call outside, "Does anyone have any jade that is of no use to them?"

The people outside exchanged glances and all fixed their eyes on the piece of mutton-fat jade hanging from Lü Liang's waist.

Lü Liang instinctively covered the jade pendant, glaring at everyone, "What are you doing? This is my token of affection, I have worn it for many years!"

"Bring it here!" Lü Si shouted, and Lü Liang immediately fell silent.

He walked in, took off the jade pendant from his waist, and bowed with a smiling face, asking Yang Kai, "Young Master Yang, what do you need this jade piece for?"

Yang Kai grinned and reached out to take the pendant, then activated his True Yuan and struck down hard onto the jade.

Lü Liang suddenly felt a chill run down his spine as he watched with anxious eyes. That palm slammed onto the jade pendant yet didn’t harm it at all; it seemed that some True Yuan had drilled inside.

Focusing intently, both Lü Si and Lü Liang were astonished, becoming increasingly impressed as they observed.

Neither of them could discern that Yang Kai was controlling his True Yuan to create some inscriptions within the jade pendant.

Simply put, he was using this method to convey a message!

Delivering some information that was hard to express in words!

However, while it was easy to say, doing it was much harder. It required extremely subtle and precise control of True Yuan to achieve this. It couldn’t be too little or too much!

After quite a while, Yang Kai withdrew his hand and handed the jade pendant back to Lü Si, saying, "Give this to Master, I guarantee your pill completion!"

His tone was quite confident.

Lü Si solemnly accepted it.

Yang Kai grinned again, "But the information within this jade can only be probed once before disappearing, so Elder Si must carefully guard it along the way."

Lü Si was taken aback, then shook his head with a wry smile, knowing that the information he had left within the jade was extremely crucial and that he didn’t want himself to know it, hence the method.

He didn’t mind and nodded seriously.

Lü Liang beside him looked at him eagerly, "Elder Si, this is my token of affection with my wife from many years ago; you must bring it back!"

Lü Si glared at him, and Lü Liang laughed dryly, quickly retreating.

"May I ask what message is contained within this jade?" Lü Si couldn’t help but be curious.

"It’s another spirit formation, but it’s different from the one just now. You give it to Master; he’ll know what it is." Yang Kai said with a light smile.

When he left Hidden Cloud Peak, Yang Kai had only glimpsed one spirit formation from the True Alchemy Formula, having no other choice but to leave that spirit formation behind.
