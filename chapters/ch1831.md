## Chapter 1831 — Not Knowing Heaven's Height and Earth's Depth

Ghost Ancestor's words had been exceedingly proper, but what left him astonished and embarrassed was that after he finished speaking no one responded; nearly ten thousand disciples in the entire plaza seemed to be dumbstruck, staring straight ahead as if someone had cast a petrification technique on them, not moving a muscle.

He quietly turned his head to look at Yang Kai and was shocked to find that the brat was actually huddled together with Su Yan and Xia Ningshang, whispering something to them, looking as if they were sweethearts.

Bastard! Ghost Ancestor cursed inwardly; he was furious at how unreliable the kid was.

But in the next moment a thunderous shout suddenly rang out.

"Heeding the Grand Elder's teachings, we will not let the Grand Elder or the Sect Master down!"

"Willing to advance and retreat with the Grand Elder, to share life and death with the Sect!"

"Grand Elder and Sect Master, rest assured, we will diligently cultivate so that the Sect may one day surpass the three great forces of the Star Domain and stand above the entire Star Domain."

"Grand Elder is mighty; willing to obey the Grand Elder's orders!"

Ghost Ancestor's joining seemed to have injected a shot of vitality into the whole Lingxiao Sect, making everyone suddenly exhilarated.

Ghost Ancestor finally exhaled inconspicuously; inexplicably, he felt the subtle satisfaction of an ugly bride meeting her in-laws at last gaining their approval...

What a fuss this was—wasn't he a Second Stage of the Void King Realm? Hadn't he come here to receive worship and enjoy the good life? How had it turned out like this?

Ghost Ancestor had a thousand questions he couldn't understand.

He forced himself to assume an air of a lofty man and smiled slightly: "Today is the first time this old man has met with you all. Hmm, I did not prepare any meeting gifts; how about this. I will remain here and expound the Dao for three days, speaking on my own understanding of the Martial Dao. If any of you have cultivation difficulties, bring them forth in full—this old man can help answer them."

At these words the nearly ten thousand disciples grew even more excited; though stirred, each strove to control their emotions and, with tacit understanding, sat cross-legged and looked up toward the direction where Ghost Ancestor stood.

Opportunities to hear a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert expound the Dao were rare; every martial artist in their cultivation would encounter problems—some in their methods, some in martial skills, some in refining Secret Treasures, and some in their own comprehension of the Martial Dao. If there was no guidance or exchange, relying on oneself alone would inevitably waste vast amounts of time.

Now there was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert here to transmit the Dao and solve doubts. This was the kind of thing one could not obtain in several lifetimes; how could the disciples not be excited?

The disciples gave him face, and Ghost Ancestor felt greatly gratified. After clearing his throat, his mellow voice began to reverberate across the plaza; in no time every disciple displayed expressions of rapture, completely immersed in his exposition on the heavenly way of the Martial Dao.

"Senior Sisters, long time no see; junior brother has missed you both terribly—come, come, let us find a quiet place and have a proper talk." Seeing Ghost Ancestor handling things with ease, Yang Kai lost interest in lingering; he grabbed Su Yan with one hand and Xia Ningshang with the other and unabashedly started to leave.

"Junior Brother!" Su Yan's pretty face flushed; she shot him a look and said, "There will be time later. Today the Grand Elder is expounding the Dao and solving doubts—it's a rare opportunity. I want to stay..."

"I also want to stay..." Xia Ningshang looked at Yang Kai with beseeching eyes.

"There will be plenty of chances; if you want, another day I'll have him teach you privately." Yang Kai grinned.

Ghost Ancestor, full of pride on the stage, almost stumbled and fell when he heard this; he glared at Yang Kai viciously, thinking: who did he think this old man was, to be used by this brat to please women—truly a humiliation.

"That might not be appropriate; the Grand Elder is after all the Grand Elder..." Xia Ningshang sounded worried.

"There's nothing inappropriate." Yang Kai ignored Ghost Ancestor's glare and chuckled, "He still wants you to refine pills for him. When you refine pills for him, have him expound the Dao to you then."

"Grand Elder wants me to refine pills?" Xia Ningshang glanced toward Ghost Ancestor.

Ghost Ancestor's heart jolted; he thought, could this woman be the Void King-Grade pill refiner the boy had mentioned? Indeed, the boy had said his Senior Sister was a Void King-Grade pill refiner, and the woman carried a strong scent of pills, clearly accustomed to dealing with pills for years.

Surely it was this woman!

The thought flashed through his mind and Ghost Ancestor hurriedly forced out a smile, giving Xia Ningshang a courteous nod, careful not to show the slightest negligence, while his mouth continued to flow with exposition.

"See, the Grand Elder has already agreed." Yang Kai seized the moment, pulling Su Yan and Xia Ningshang and running off, giving the two no chance to hesitate; their faces flushed scarlet and they hung their heads and said nothing.

Halfway there Xia Ningshang suddenly remembered something and said, "By the way, Junior Brother, Yang Yan—Miss Yang Yan, she..."

"I know!" Yang Kai cut her off.

When he had just returned to the Lingxiao Sect he had sensed Yang Yan's Divine Sense sweep across his body and vanish, so he was almost certain Yang Yan had awakened!

That legendary Starry Sky Emperor had returned!

But he had no time to handle Yang Yan's matters now; it was more important to talk with Su Yan and Xia Ningshang first.

......

Five days later, at the Hundred Flowers Residence.

Yang Kai strolled in casually; just as he entered, a young maiden suddenly somersaulted through the air and her slender, well-shaped calf swept past—there was not the slightest fluctuation of energy on that leg, as if it were relying purely on physical strength.

Yang Kai's expression turned extremely grave; he let out a low exclamation, his body sank, and his right arm went up horizontally to block.

Boom...

It was like two mountains colliding at tremendous speed; a violent explosion sounded in the air and the ground beneath Yang Kai's feet was pulverized. The young maiden who had suddenly launched the attack cried out and was blasted backwards.

She flipped nimbly in midair, rolled a few times, and landed gracefully; bending to rub her leg, she glared at Yang Kai angrily: "Sect Master Uncle, is your body made of steel? You hurt me terribly!"

As she spoke she almost squeezed out a few tears.

"Little miss," Yang Kai looked at her with a smile, "Every time I see you you want to spar with me; why? Very confident in your physical strength?"

"Hmph." The little girl snorted and raised her nose: "Great Elder said I have a Force Tyrant Body, unparalleled through the ages; Senior Aunt Yang Yan also said I had great talent. They're all lying to me. I can't even handle Sect Master Uncle, and I've taken so many Huntian Pills."

"Heh heh, it's not that they're lying to you—it's that you're too young. When you reach my age..."

“Then I’ll be able to deal with you?” the little girl said excitedly.

“No! You’ll grow, but I won’t be standing still either. It’s just that you’ll keep getting stronger. However… why are you so eager to ‘deal with’ me?” Yang Kai asked in surprise, staring at the little girl.

The little girl turned out to be Lin Yun'er, the orphan Huang Juan had adopted.

After some time apart Lin Yun'er's physical strength had become ever more terrifying; the power hidden in her small body was hardly inferior to that of a typical Origin Returning Realm cultivator. If she unleashed Saint Yuan she could contend with a normal Origin Returning Realm practitioner.

How old was the little girl? At most sixteen or seventeen years old this year, yet she had already achieved such accomplishments—Yang Kai could almost picture her becoming a famed figure resonating across the Star Domain in time to come.

When Yang Kai asked, Lin Yun'er answered, "Senior Aunt Yang Yan said that if Yun'er could beat Sect Master Uncle then she would take me to a good place and make me stronger."

Yang Kai's mouth twitched as he looked toward the Hundred Flowers Pavilion where Yang Yan was leisurely sipping tea.

The awakened Yang Yan felt entirely different from when she was asleep. As Yang Kai looked at her, he found her somewhat unfamiliar, and couldn’t help but furrow his brows.

“I thought you were planning to stay holed up in Tianyi Palace forever,” Yang Yan said with a faint smile as she set down her teacup and looked meaningfully at Yang Kai. “Have you been enjoying yourself these past few days?”

“Not bad,” Yang Kai replied. Even with his usually thick skin, his face flushed bright red at that moment. To divert the topic, he glanced around and, spotting the Ghost Ancestor standing beside Yang Yan, said in surprise, “Oh, Elder, you’re here too? What a coincidence.”

"Heh heh..." Ghost Ancestor's mouth twitched wildly.

In fact Yang Kai had noticed him as soon as he arrived; from Ghost Ancestor's appearance it seemed he had suffered a great loss at Yang Yan's hands, and now stood behind her like a servant, solemn and respectful, the evil aura on his body cowering and not daring to show itself.

"Is this your newly recruited Grand Elder?" Yang Yan pointed at Ghost Ancestor and asked Yang Kai.

"Mm. Senior Ghost Ancestor has the cultivation of a Second Stage of the Void King Realm, more than competent to serve as this Sect's Grand Elder." Yang Kai said this as he walked up to the Hundred Flowers Pavilion and sat opposite Yang Yan.

Lin Yun'er obediently followed up and, grinning, poured a cup of water for Yang Kai.

She seemed perfectly at ease in front of Yang Yan, not the least bit pressured; by comparison Ghost Ancestor looked like a mouse confronted by a cat...

"His cultivation is so-so, but... he is somewhat ignorant of his place." Yang Yan snorted lightly.

Yang Kai saw this clearly—when Ghost Ancestor heard that he shivered involuntarily.

So he really had suffered heavily at Yang Yan's hands! What on earth had Ghost Ancestor done? Yang Kai became curious and turned to look at him.

Ghost Ancestor forced a sheepish smile: "My lord, this old man is new to the Grand Elder post and was a touch arrogant, having offended you out of ignorance; I beg your magnanimity and do not wish to trade barbs with you."

"Have I traded barbs with you?" Yang Yan smiled sweetly at him. "What you said yesterday was very good; it solved many confusions on my path of cultivation—I'm grateful to you. Today I want to ask you some things; does the Grand Elder have time?"

"You flatter me..." Ghost Ancestor nearly wept, "I truly did not know what sort of divine presence you were; I thought you were an ordinary disciple, so I stepped forward..."

“Elder, don’t tell me you actually took the initiative to teach her the Dao?” Yang Kai’s mouth opened wider than an egg.

Ghost Ancestor looked tragic and indignant and gently nodded.
