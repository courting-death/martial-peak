## Chapter 2512 — Phoenix Clan Inheritance

Next, Mo Xiaoqi and Zhang Ruoxi could only see Yang Kai’s lips moving constantly, his expression solemn as he communicated via voice transmission with Li Wuyi and Jiu Feng. After hearing Yang Kai’s words, the two top Emperor Realm experts reacted intensely—shock, horror, solemnity, reverence, regret... a myriad of expressions crossed their faces.

From time to time, Li Wuyi and Jiu Feng would interject with a question, and Yang Kai answered each one in turn.

“What are they talking about?” Mo Xiaoqi quietly asked Zhang Ruoxi.

Zhang Ruoxi shook her head, indicating she didn’t know either.

Mo Xiaoqi said, “Actually, I’m really curious. After I lost consciousness, what exactly happened in the Shattered Star Sea? Do you know?”

Zhang Ruoxi still shook her head, replying softly, “I passed out at almost the same time as you. When I woke up, I was already here.”

The two young girls exchanged a glance, suddenly feeling a subtle sense of shared misfortune.

After a while, Li Wuyi finally said solemnly, “So that’s what happened.”

Jiu Feng’s expression also turned grave as she said, “This matter truly must be reported to the Lord. That Lord's condition is far from optimistic—sharing a single body with such a demonic being, bearing two souls within. I fear the days ahead will not be easy for him.”

Yang Kai sighed, “Senior Duan left not long ago, but he didn’t say where he was going. If the Beast Great Emperor can find him, that would be best. Senior Duan risked his life for all living beings under heaven. I deeply admire him and can’t bear to see him suffer in the future.”

Jiu Feng said solemnly, “Rest assured. My Lord will not stand by and do nothing. Once we return to the Spirit Beast Island, I will report this matter in full detail.”

Yang Kai was overjoyed and said, “Thank you, Senior.”

If the Beast Great Emperor personally searched, he should be able to find Duan Hongchen. Maybe he would have a way to resolve Duan Hongchen’s current predicament.

“I really didn’t expect such a bizarre event to happen in the Shattered Star Sea this time. No wonder the elite cultivators of the four territories were suddenly expelled from the Shattered Star Sea without warning. Before coming here, the Lord said there would be changes in the Shattered Star Sea. I never thought it would be such a major upheaval.” Li Wuyi sighed with emotion.

“Fortunately, everyone made it out safely. If the upheaval in the Shattered Star Sea had caused any casualties among them...” She trailed off, shivering at the thought, unable to finish her sentence.

She changed the subject. Her beautiful eyes burned as she looked at Yang Kai and said, “Boy, there’s something that’s been on my mind since I arrived here...” She pointed to where the Phoenix Egg was and said in a deep voice, “Why do I sense... the aura of the True Phoenix Fire over there!”

Li Wuyi was startled, exclaiming in shock, “True Phoenix Fire?”

After speaking, he immediately looked over. When he saw the intricate patterns atop the Phoenix Egg, he couldn’t help but gasp, crying out, “Phoenix Clan Inheritance!”

Yang Kai looked at Li Wuyi in surprise and said, “Senior, you recognize it?”

He had only been able to confirm it was a Phoenix Clan inheritance because he was attacked by a strange secret technique while probing the patterns, but he hadn’t expected Li Wuyi to recognize it at a glance.

Li Wuyi stared blankly for a while before saying, “There are records about the Phoenix Clan on the Spirit Beast Island. And...” At this, he glanced meaningfully at Jiu Feng and said no more.

Jiu Feng asked, “Is that truly the True Phoenix Fire?”

Yang Kai nodded, “That’s right.”

“I’ve heard there’s a remnant of the True Phoenix Fire in the Shattered Star Sea, once possessed by the Martial Flame Great Emperor. And you just came out of the Shattered Star Sea—could it be...” Jiu Feng, sharp as ever, quickly deduced some things.

Yang Kai didn’t hide anything and admitted, “Senior, you’re correct. The True Phoenix Fire does come from the Shattered Star Sea. It’s also a relic left by the Martial Flame Great Emperor.”

Although she had guessed, when Yang Kai confirmed it, Jiu Feng couldn’t help but gasp, looking at the Phoenix Egg with a mix of envy and jealousy. “I went to the Shattered Star Sea back then, hoping to find the True Phoenix Fire, but came away empty-handed. I never thought I’d have the chance to see it today.”

After a pause, she frowned and said, “Since it’s become a Phoenix Egg, that means someone has refined the True Phoenix Fire? For the True Phoenix Fire to acknowledge someone’s existence—just who is this person?”

Before Yang Kai could answer, Mo Xiaoqi interjected, “It’s Sister Liu Yan.”

“Oh?” Jiu Feng’s beautiful eyes lit up as she murmured, “That Artifact Spirit?”

Judging by her expression and tone, it seemed she’d heard Mo Xiaoqi mention Liu Yan before and knew Liu Yan was an Artifact Spirit.

She couldn’t help but praise, “For a mere Artifact Spirit to be acknowledged by the True Phoenix Fire... it must be destiny. Once she is reborn, she’ll inherit the Phoenix Clan’s legacy and truly have a chance to become one of them.”

Yang Kai’s heart stirred and he said, “Senior Jiu Feng, you seem to know a lot about the Phoenix Clan.”

“Know a lot?” Jiu Feng gave Yang Kai a strange look.

Yang Kai said awkwardly, “Did I say something wrong?”

Mo Xiaoqi smiled, “Eldest Brother Yang, Aunt Feng possesses extremely pure Phoenix Clan bloodline. In this world, aside from the true Phoenix Clan, no one understands them better than she does.”

“What?” Yang Kai exclaimed, “Senior Jiu Feng actually has Phoenix Clan blood?”

This was the first he’d heard of it, but thinking about it, Jiu Feng’s name did have the character for ‘phoenix’, her power was fiery like a Fire Phoenix, and she came from a place like Spirit Beast Island...

Overjoyed, Yang Kai quickly said, “Senior, since you have Phoenix Clan blood, may I ask when my friend will be able to break out of the egg and be reborn?”

Jiu Feng frowned, “That’s hard to say. I’d like to know... if I hadn’t come here, what would you have done?”

“What would I have done?” Yang Kai was taken aback, then said, “Wait.”

“Wait?” Jiu Feng looked at Yang Kai strangely. “Wait here for a year or two?”

“A year or two? That long?” Yang Kai was startled.

“You think that’s long? It could be a year or two, or it could be eight or ten years. Refining the True Phoenix Fire isn’t easy. Although your friend seems to have gained its recognition and become a Phoenix Egg, that’s only the beginning. To truly refine it and fully possess the True Phoenix Fire is a huge ordeal. If your friend can’t endure, she’ll be burned to death. Even if she can, it won’t be accomplished in a short time.”

“Even if she succeeds, how will she control the True Phoenix Fire? How will she learn the Phoenix Clan’s secret techniques?”

Yang Kai listened with a grave expression.

He realized he’d underestimated things. He’d thought Liu Yan would reappear before him soon, but after hearing Jiu Feng, he understood the dangers involved.

Since Jiu Feng had Phoenix Clan blood, she must know the Phoenix Clan well. What she said couldn’t be wrong.

Yang Kai broke out in a cold sweat. “Senior, please give me some guidance.”

Jiu Feng said, “Even if I guide you, it’s useless. You don’t understand the Phoenix Clan’s inheritance or the mysteries of the True Phoenix Fire. You can’t even act as her protector.”

Yang Kai said, “Senior, could you explain it clearly? Maybe I’ll understand.”

Jiu Feng shot him a sidelong glance and snorted coldly, “If I gave you all the ingredients in the world, could you prepare a feast?”

Yang Kai wiped the sweat from his brow and said sheepishly, “I could at least roast them.”

Mo Xiaoqi came over, shaking Jiu Feng’s arm. “Aunt Feng, Sister Liu Yan is a really good person. If you can help, please do.”

Jiu Feng glared at her. “Don’t try that with me. I haven’t settled accounts with you yet. All you ever think about is running off to play, and you don’t care about cultivation at all. If Uncle Li and I hadn’t come looking for you this time, would you have run off again?”

Mo Xiaoqi pouted, “Fine... fine, if you help Sister Liu Yan this time, I’ll obediently go back to the island with you and won’t leave until I reach the Emperor Realm, okay?”

“Oh?” Jiu Feng’s beautiful eyes brightened as she fixed Mo Xiaoqi with a scorching gaze. “Those were your own words.”

Mo Xiaoqi showed a trace of frustration, but after closing her eyes for a moment, she said resololutely, “Yes. I said it.”

“That’s a good deal!” Li Wuyi smiled faintly.

Jiu Feng also laughed and said, “Since you put it that way, Aunt Feng naturally can’t just stand by.”

Mo Xiaoqi huffed, “You’re so bad, Aunt Feng! You’d never help unless you saw the benefit for yourself!”

Jiu Feng giggled, looking at her with great interest. “You can still back out now. At worst, Uncle Li and I will just drag you back to the island. It’s all the same.”

Mo Xiaoqi stomped her foot in frustration and cried out, “I hate you both!”

Jiu Feng’s smile faded as she looked at Yang Kai. “If you’re willing, I’ll take the Phoenix Egg back to the Spirit Beast Island and use Phoenix Clan secret techniques to protect her.”

“Take it back to the Spirit Beast Island?” Yang Kai was momentarily dazed and couldn’t help glancing at the Phoenix Egg.

Jiu Feng said, “You can come to Spirit Beast Island too. Although we don’t get many visitors, since you’re Xiaoqi’s friend, it’s fine for you to stay for a while. I’m sure the Lord won’t object.”

Mo Xiaoqi’s eyes lit up and she called out sweetly, “That’s right, Eldest Brother Yang, come to Spirit Beast Island with me! Our Spirit Beast Island is beautiful.”

Her face was full of hope, her beautiful eyes shining.

Yang Kai couldn’t bear to look at her. He turned to Jiu Feng and asked, “Senior, in your estimation, how long will it take Liu Yan to refine the True Phoenix Fire?”

Jiu Feng replied, “At the very least, a year. It’s said that the Martial Flame Great Emperor took five months to refine the True Phoenix Fire back then. A year is the most conservative estimate, and that’s if everything goes smoothly.”

“A year...” Yang Kai sighed. “Then please take her away, Senior. Spirit Beast Island... I’ll visit when I have the chance. I still have some things to take care of right now.”

Mo Xiaoqi looked disappointed when she heard this.

Jiu Feng nodded, “Don’t worry. Since I promised to protect her, I won’t hold back. I’m also curious to see what miraculous changes will occur when an Artifact Spirit refines the True Phoenix Fire!”

As she spoke, her face was full of anticipation and excitement, her beautiful eyes shining with a dangerous light.

As she spoke, she reached out and directly drew the distant Phoenix Egg over, wrapping it in Emperor Yuan. Seemingly sensing something, the strange patterns on the egg began to wriggle like living things. Faintly, a very weak cry could be heard from within the egg.
