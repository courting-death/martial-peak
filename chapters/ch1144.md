## Chapter 1144 — No More Xu Family

Yang Kai hadn’t expected that the Shi of an Origin Returning Realm expert could be so formidable. Even trapped within Yang Yan’s formation and forced to split their focus, Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother still managed to hinder the assault of his Golden Blood.

This only strengthened his resolve to kill the two of them.

His figure followed in the wake of the myriad golden rays, the Demonic Flame longsword in his hand appearing once more.

Those outside the formation were stunned the moment Yang Kai charged in.
Soon after, they heard the screams and furious shouts of Hong Zhen and his Senior Brother. Then, from one spot within the formation, a violent surge of energy erupted — and a figure suddenly shot out from inside.

Yang Kai flew out; suspended midair, he spat several mouthfuls of congealed blood that scattered dazzling gold in the sunset glow. His face was deathly pale, the Demonic Flame longsword rolling in his hand was nearly extinguished, and his Saint Yuan was extremely unstable.

Everyone saw that his chest seemed to have caved in considerably.

"Yang Kai!" Wu Yi's face went white; she rushed forward and caught him, the impact forcing her back a dozen paces before she could steady herself.

Still unsteady, Yang Kai coughed another mouthful of Golden Blood, then waved at Wu Yi, seized a pill, shoved it into his mouth, and sat cross-legged. The sunken chest visibly began to recover.

The scene fell silent; only from within the misted area came the ragged breaths of the two Hong Zhen brothers — they weren't dead! But aside from Yang Yan, no one could see how they truly fared.

"Who is still making a move!" A figure descended, carrying an awe-inspiring aura that swept in all directions; everyone shivered at the force, Xie Hongwen trembled like a sieve and dared not speak.

"Elder Qian!" Luo Qing hurried forward and cupped his fists to Qian Tong in salute.

"Hm. Nephew Yang?" As soon as Qian Tong landed he asked after Yang Kai, but before Luo Qing could answer his Divine Sense swept over the healing Yang Kai and he immediately realized how badly injured Yang Kai was. His already sullen face grew even more grim, like a volcano moments from eruption.

Yang Kai had an Origin-Grade artificer backing him. Master Gelin of Yingyue Hall didn’t have much time left to live. If a suitable replacement couldn’t be found before Master Gelin’s passing, then all of Yingyue Hall’s Origin-Grade Secret Treasures would have to be purchased from other powers in the future — and if they were damaged, they’d likewise have to be sent elsewhere for repair.

This wasn’t just a matter of finding an Origin-Grade artificer — it concerned the very foundation of Yingyue Hall’s dealings with other powers. If the production of Origin-Grade Secret Treasures had to depend on outsiders, Yingyue Hall would lose its bargaining power and be forced to pay an unimaginable price.

So he had rushed over at once after receiving Luo Qing's message; he wanted to see who would dare make trouble for Yang Kai — he had already broadcast Yang Kai's image and yet someone still opposed him; who had the heart of a bear, the courage of a leopard?

Seeing Yang Kai injured, he immediately wanted to step forward — but as soon as his foot moved, he froze in place. His gaze trembled as he looked toward the location of the formation, his pupils contracting sharply as he exclaimed in shock, “A grandmaster-level formation?”

His strength exceeded Hong Zhen's and his experience was broad; at a glance he could tell this formation wasn't something ordinary people could set, and even with his Divine Sense cultivation he couldn't see everything within.

There were many watching Yang Kai beside the cave, clearly wary of him. Qian Tong understood they were on guard; rushing in might not be wise. He hastily called, "Nephew Yang, I have a Rose Pill here that aids healing; if you don't mind, please take it!"

Saying this, he tossed a jade bottle over.

He knew Yang Kai couldn't reply or much respond, but he had to make his stance clear so those with Yang Kai wouldn't be overly tense.

Sure enough, upon hearing him Wu Yi and Yang Yan and the others relaxed noticeably. Wu Yi reached out, took the jade bottle, and politely said, "Thank you, Senior."

She showed a calm face, but inside her heart turbulent waves had already risen.

The Rose Pill is a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level pill whose chief ingredient is a Saint King-Grade Upper-Level Blood Rose. The material isn't hard to find but the pill is extremely difficult to refine; an Origin-Grade Lower-Level alchemist making ten batches might only succeed three times — already very good odds.

The difficulty of refining such a healing pill is no less than that of an Origin-Grade Lower-Level pill.

Why was Qian Tong so good to Yang Kai? What was their relationship? He even produced a Rose Pill; if Wu Yi hadn't personally brought Yang Kai back from the Starry Sky and known he came from the outside world, she might have suspected Yang Kai to be some elder of Yingyue Hall's son.

Just as she was about to take out the Rose Pill for Yang Kai, Yang Kai's weak voice sounded in her ear: "No need."

He didn't need Qian Tong's pill; the pills he'd taken earlier were self-made. Though a lower grade than the Rose Pill, his constitution meant he could recover without them; with rest he'd fully heal.

He only considered taking pills because he wasn't sure where Qian Tong stood; if he proved hostile, he'd have to fight again.

Fortunately Qian Tong had shown goodwill upon arrival, which made Yang Kai feel warmer toward him. Whatever his motive, Yang Kai felt no malice, and that was enough.

"Explain exactly what happened," Qian Tong's face darkened; his eyes scanned the trembling Xie Hongwen and then the formation before he asked Luo Qing calmly.

Luo Qing dared not hide it and recounted what had occurred.

Upon learning Xie Hongwen had ordered Yang Kai killed, Qian Tong flared with fury and slapped him; in front of everyone Xie Hongwen was knocked flying, spun several times, and crashed to the ground.

"Elder Qian..." Xie Hongwen felt his guts turn to water; several teeth were knocked loose and his cheek swollen, yet he dared not utter a complaint, only pitifully cried out.

“If it weren’t for your father being a deacon, you’d be dead for sure today!” Qian Tong shot him a cold glance.

Xie Hongwen's eyes flashed with resentment but he still kowtowed repeatedly, "Thank you, Elder Qian, for sparing me."

Since Qian Tong had said so, Xie Hongwen realized he wouldn't be killed. He came to his senses and noticed his clothes were soaked through.

"Don't be too quick to thank me; my sparing you doesn't mean others will. Your life and death will be decided by Nephew Yang!" Qian Tong snorted.

Xie Hongwen was stupefied — he never imagined the youngster he'd scorned could now control his fate. Thinking of how he'd treated Yang Kai before, Xie Hongwen had no tears left to shed.

If he fell into that boy's hands, what good would he have? But who exactly was that boy, and why would Elder Qian protect him so fiercely?

It wasn't only Xie Hongwen who couldn't understand; the Xu Family, Haike Family, and others were equally baffled. Wu Yi and Yu Feng were also at a loss. Though puzzled, they all knew the crisis was past and beams of joy returned to their faces.

"Xu Family?" Qian Tong turned his gaze to the prostrate Xu Zhibing and said calmly, "From today forth, there is no Xu Family!"

Xu Zhibing fainted completely, and the other Xu Family cultivators turned ashen.

They were merely a small peripheral clan attached to Yingyue Hall; when a figure of Qian Tong's standing spoke, even if Xie Hongwen wanted to annihilate them, they had no power to resist.

The Xu Family's members were filled with regret; had they not sought revenge they might have preserved bloodlines and estate to rebuild later, but Qian Tong's one sentence scattered the Xu Family like passing clouds.

"Yes, I will dispatch disciples to handle it!" Luo Qing nodded and told the Xu Family cultivators, "All of you follow me."

The Xu Family cultivators knew their future was bleak but dared not disobey; two carried the unconscious Xu Zhibing and, stumbling, followed Luo Qing away into the distance.

"Haike Family?" Qian Tong then turned his head to Ian.

Ian trembled and hurried forward, "Ian greets Elder Qian. I beg for mercy; I was momentarily foolish, please spare me!"

Qian Tong gave a cold smile. “Your lives will be spared for now. How to deal with you — that will be decided once Nephew Yang speaks.”

Revenge is far more satisfying when exacted by oneself; he had already wiped out the Xu Family with a word. If he wiped out the Haike Family as well, where would Yang Kai vent his wrath? If Yang Kai wasn't appeased, how could they discuss anything else with him?

Hearing Qian Tong's words, Ian's face darkened; he knew being handed to Yang Kai meant no good outcome and bitter misery filled his heart.

At that moment Yang Kai rose to his feet; though still pale, fluctuations of his Saint Yuan had calmed.

"Close the formation." Yang Kai ordered Yang Yan.

Yang Yan nodded and the mist vanished; the clearing before the cave came into view, and when everyone saw the two Hong Zhen brothers' pitiful state they all gasped.

When Yang Kai had been flung out earlier and looked badly injured, they had assumed the Hong Zhen brothers were unharmed. Now they saw the brothers were far worse off than Yang Kai.

Their bodies were covered in blood and wounds — every inch was lacerated. Hong Zhen had lost an arm, and his brother had lost a leg. They sat together, listless, casting fearful glances around.

Yang Kai sighed; he knew he had underestimated the Origin Returning Realm. He had thought using Golden Blood with Yang Yan's formation would surely bring them down, but in the instant of attack he realized he had been wrong.

Shi's power is strange — the two overlapped their Shi so that it not only interfered with his movements but slowed his attack speed and even allowed them to sense his attack directions in advance.

Had he not used Golden Blood, Yang Kai couldn't have harmed them.
