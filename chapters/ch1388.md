## Chapter 1388 — Confirming One Thing

The Flying Shark Battle Shuttle hurtled forward at an unimaginable speed; Yang Kai sat cross‑legged inside one of its cabins cultivating alone, while Yang Yan controlled the shuttle's course.

Riding this special flying Secret Treasure was far better than using a Star Shuttle.

First, this Flying Shark Battle Shuttle had its own private compartment with ample room, so Yang Kai inside it was completely free from outside disturbances — something a Star Shuttle couldn't begin to match.

Second, when piloting a Star Shuttle, activating its defenses to withstand headwinds always consumed a martial artist's Saint Yuan, but the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle had none of those concerns — all its power came from the Origin Saint Crystal and it consumed none of the wielder's strength.

Third, this Flying Shark Battle Shuttle, refined by Yang Yan, flew at a speed no ordinary Star Shuttle could match.

At the very least, Yang Kai had been cultivating here for more than ten days without feeling the slightest ripple; it was as if he were in a sealed chamber, with outside disturbances unable to reach him.

He was now at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm; one more step would be the Origin Returning Realm, where one could condense one's Shi. But advancing to the Origin Returning Realm was not so simple — at present Yang Kai saw no hope; he secretly felt it probably could not be achieved by mere arduous cultivation and might require some chance and external stimulus.

His last breakthrough to the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm had been similar: hearing news of Su Yan from Qian Yue triggered the opportunity to break through.

Yang Kai wanted to hunt for that opportunity by practicing various secret arts, so in recent days he had been refining Golden Blood Threads, using the World‑Ending Demon Eye to assimilate the Glazed Pearl, and even the last few Flowing Flame Fireblazes had been consumed in his refining.

The power of the Divine Sense Fire had increased considerably; this enhancement allowed him to be more relaxed and at ease when pill‑refining, and his Divine Sense strength had greatly risen — if he were to perform the Blooming Lotus secret technique its power would surely increase.

However, Yang Kai had not yet found an opportunity to test it.

That day he was using Golden Blood to condense a new Golden Blood Thread when he suddenly felt the shuttle tremble and come to a stop.

Yang Kai opened his eyes, rose, and walked outside; after a moment he came to Yang Yan's side.

"We're almost there. For the rest of the journey we'll use the Star Shuttle," Yang Yan said, glancing at him.

Yang Kai naturally had no objection; he had always been curious where Yang Yan was going this time, and with the answer about to be revealed he was filled with anticipation.

The two stepped out of the battle shuttle. Yang Yan formed a few hand seals, and the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle rapidly shrank and was sealed away in her Spatial Ring. Only then did they summon a Star Shuttle and plunge forward.

The farther they sped, the more Yang Kai could clearly sense the gathering and richness of fire‑type Spiritual Qi in the heavens and earth; gradually his expression grew strange, as if deep in thought.

Two days later a streak of crimson appeared on the horizon. When the parched earth below — countless gullies and fissures like jagged teeth crisscrossing the land — came into view, Yang Kai exclaimed, "Flowing Flame Sandland? Is this the Flowing Flame Sandland you're heading to?"

He remembered that familiar scene vividly; in the entire Dark Star, perhaps only the vicinity of the Flowing Flame Sandland had such a hostile environment.

But as Yang Kai knew, even by Star Shuttle it would take two or three months from the Flowing Flame Sandland to Tianyun City. Yet this time he and Yang Yan had arrived in just a little over ten days.

It showed how terrifyingly fast the Flying Shark Battle Shuttle was.

Faced with Yang Kai's question, Yang Yan did not answer, only staring blankly at that patch of crimson; her eyes flickered with a complicated look, as if in mourning and yet tinged with fear — oddly conflicted.

As they drew nearer her expression grew more pronounced; she seemed afraid of something and her face paled slightly.

Yang Kai stepped forward and gently took her hand.

Yang Yan was startled. She turned and, seeing Yang Kai, forced a faint smile.

"Why did you come here? You can tell me now, can't you?" Yang Kai gazed into her eyes.

"To confirm one thing," Yang Yan hesitated, then replied truthfully.

"Oh? What needs confirmation at the Flowing Flame Sandland?" Yang Kai asked in surprise; the last time the Flowing Flame Sandland opened, Yang Yan had been dismissive and had no intention of accompanying anyone, yet after it had been closed for several years she had taken the initiative to come.

One must understand that it was impossible to penetrate deeply now unless one used a Star Emperor Token to clear a path.

When Yang Kai had been detained in the Flowing Flame Sandland before, it was only by using a Star Emperor Token to make a way that he could return safely; that had cost him a great deal of time and suffering.

"Yang Kai, do you believe in reincarnation?" Yang Yan suddenly asked out of the blue.

"What do you mean?" Yang Kai frowned.

Yang Yan gave a bitter smile. "Do you remember I told you the forging and array knowledge I possess came with me at birth and no one taught me? In my memories there is no concept of parents; it's as if I appeared in this world out of thin air."

Yang Kai's brow tightened further; utterly unsure what she meant, he could only comfort her, "No one truly appears out of thin air; perhaps you suffered something and your memories are fragmented."

"Perhaps," Yang Yan said with a wry smile and stopped analyzing it further.

By then the two had already reached the outer edge of the Flowing Flame Sandland's First Heat‑Flame Zone, staring at the black, rolling flame barrier; even with Yang Kai's increased strength his heart raced.

A terrifying force emanated from inside that flame barrier; even martial artists at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm who tried to force their way in would meet only death.

Whether it was his imagination or not, the flames seemed to roll even more fiercely when Yang Yan arrived.

"In my many years of dreams I often dream I become another person — a person who commands storms, who with one hand covers the heavens and rules as an overlord!" Yang Yan stared ahead, not panicked, simply murmuring softly.

"You think you are that person?" Yang Kai looked at her solemn face; he wanted to laugh but could not, feeling that something was off.

“I never used to think so, but ever since the Imperial Garden emerged, those elusive dreams have become far more vivid. Sometimes, while I’m meditating or refining artifacts, those inexplicable visions appear again. Considering all that I’ve experienced over these years, I can’t help but suspect there’s a deeper meaning behind them.”

"You came here to confirm that?" Yang Kai finally sorted his thoughts and asked in astonishment, "How would you confirm it? What's so special about this place?"

"Very simple!" Yang Yan smiled; with a graceful motion she vanished from where she stood and darted straight into the Flowing Flame Sandland. Whatever exquisite footwork she used, Yang Kai could not stop her.

Yang Kai's face changed drastically; he whirled and looked into the Flowing Flame Sandland only to see Yang Yan's figure already swallowed by the flame barrier.

He hurriedly drew a Star Emperor Token intending to use its power to follow, but the flame barrier suddenly roared and writhed; an overwhelming resisting force poured out, like an invisible giant hand pushing, flinging Yang Kai fully hundreds of zhang away.

Yang Yan's intrusion was like casting salt into hot oil, making the Flowing Flame Sandland's First Heat‑Flame Zone utterly boil over.

The heavens and earth hummed; the already blood‑red sky at that moment seemed to redden as if weeping blood, and the earth's crisscrossing gullies split into wider chasms. A mountain‑shattering, earth‑rending sensation assaulted from all directions, and Yang Kai staggered, barely able to keep his footing.

Looking out across the distance, the Spiritual Qi within the Heat-Flame Zone, the first layer of the Flowing Flame Sandland, had already fallen into complete chaos. Within a radius of a thousand li, all fire-attributed Spiritual Qi was madly surging toward this place, gathering to such an extent that it became visibly dense to the naked eye in an instant.

Yang Kai stared, his face pale.

With such a violent convergence of energy, not to mention one Yang Yan entering it — even the strongest experts on Dark Star could not withstand it; they would be pulverized in an instant.

Yet when he saw a graceful figure calmly suspended in midair, his taut heart suddenly eased.

Yang Yan was, impossibly, unharmed!

Though her features and movements were indistinct, the blurred silhouette showed her constantly forming hand seals; centered on her position, the fire‑type Spiritual Qi and the flames of the Flowing Flame Sandland's First Heat‑Flame Zone were all gathering toward her.

The momentum was terrifying.

Such a massive alteration of the heavens and earth naturally drew much attention; even martial artists tens of thousands of li away could clearly sense it.

In an instant numerous lights shot into the sky, all heading toward the Flowing Flame Sandland to witness the scene.

Yang Kai stood where he was, anxiously watching, his thoughts in turmoil.

He could never have imagined Yang Yan would be so bold as to rush alone into the Heat‑Flame Zone — what could she be trying to confirm that she would risk her life? He felt both angry and anxious yet utterly helpless; every time he tried to approach he was shoved back by that immense force.

Yang Kai finally understood what it meant to be powerless!

Rumble……

A tremendous sound echoed from all around as the First Heat‑Flame Zone's heat churned and streamed, constantly converging toward Yang Yan as if her side were a bottomless pit able to receive any amount.

As time passed, Yang Kai was astonished to find that the heat within the First Heat‑Flame Zone was rapidly thinning and its power greatly diminished, leaving him dumbfounded.

Half an hour later Yang Yan's delicate form became clear; the First Heat‑Flame Zone had nearly ceased to exist. Yang Kai watched as Yang Yan stood, solemn and with eyes closed, her black robe moving though there was no wind, her long hair flowing, and a blood‑red ring held between her hands.

The ring was about the size of a necklace, yet it radiated terrifying fire‑type energy fluctuations: all the fire‑type Spiritual Qi and the heat of the Heat‑Flame Zone were pouring into it to be devoured.
