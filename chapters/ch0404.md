## Chapter 404 — Don't Make a Scene

Huo Xingchen slightly nodded, "There’s no need for you to say anything. Besides, I'm not angry at all; it actually feels like it’s been a long time since I've been this happy. Such trivial matters can no longer satisfy this young master’s appetite!"

Pausing for a moment, he continued, "By the way, do you have that much money on you?"

The two experts from the Huo Family exchanged awkward glances and slowly shook their heads. Who would carry a few million taels of silver when going out for no reason?

"Owing money to others is not a good thing," Huo Xingchen muttered while stroking his chin.

In the Bamboo Segment Hall, Yang Kai sat cross-legged on the ground, gathering his True Essence, attempting to break through his bottleneck.

An hour later, the constrictions within him shattered with a thunderous sound, and the rolling True Essence slowly calmed down as his Realm stepped up a level, achieving a new stage.

He had reached the Eighth Stage of the True Essence Realm!

At the moment of breakthrough, Yang Kai seemed to see a multicolored lotus blooming brilliantly before him, but it vanished in an instant.

Warm Spirit Lotus!

Since acquiring it, Yang Kai hadn’t seen it again. Although he knew it existed within his mind, continually nourishing his Divine Sense, he had not been able to see it with his own eyes due to not having opened his Sea of Consciousness.

This occurrence brought Yang Kai some delight, making him wonder if his Sea of Consciousness was on the verge of initial formation, allowing him to witness such a fleeting moment.

In terms of the strength of his Divine Sense, Yang Kai only had a general understanding.

It was not inferior to an average Eighth Stage expert in the Divine Roaming Realm, essentially comparable to the Divine Sense intensity of a Ninth Stage expert in the same realm. This was only with his True Essence Realm’s strength. If he were to truly ascend to the Divine Roaming Realm, with the protection of the Sea of Consciousness, to what extent would his Divine Sense’s power be enhanced?

He found himself increasingly anticipating that forthcoming grand Realm.

The Divine Roaming Realm had always been the ultimate threshold for martial artists. In this world, apart from a few individuals capable of breaking through to reach higher stages, the majority of martial artists could only strive to reach the heights of the Divine Roaming.

Stepping into the Divine Roaming Realm meant a martial artist had embarked on the path of the strong. Countless martial artists would cultivate tirelessly for this goal, exploring day and night in the pursuit of strength.

Some even lived deep in the mountains for years, seeking to grasp the true essence of power and probing into the mysteries of various Realms.

Nevertheless, most martial artists ultimately remained blocked at this threshold for their entire lives, feeling helpless and regretting their existence.

Yet, even if someone managed to break through to the Divine Roaming Realm, there remained nine stages within it, with higher realms unknown to the masses.

Having broken through to the Eighth Stage of the True Essence Realm, Yang Kai did not get up immediately.

Instead, he sat in place, slowly comprehending the changes brought about by this newly achieved stage.

Washed by Wan Yao Ling Ye, each breakthrough seemed to cause significant changes in him. At the very least, he felt much stronger now than before.

This sense was elusive and indescribable, but if he had to make a comparison, it would be that his current self could easily defeat the version of himself before the breakthrough.

One day later, Yang Kai slowly opened his eyes, his gaze dazzling with spirit. After a long silence, he finally stood up.

He opened the hall door and stepped outside.

Outside the hall, more than a dozen people formed two lines, eagerly looking forward. Upon seeing Yang Kai emerge, they quickly bowed, "We greet the Young Master!"

Yang Kai's gaze swept across them, and he couldn't help but be startled.

He discovered that the several individuals on the left were the high-ranking members of the Bamboo Segment Gang led by Pang Chi, while on the right side were high-ranking members of the Xuan Guang Association led by Mu Nandou. Among them was Wu Qian, who had previously clashed with Pang Chi and had nearly killed him.

Both groups bowed their heads respectfully, yet Mu Nandou wore an expression of helplessness while Pang Chi looked flush with excitement, almost as if he was reveling in the moment.

Yang Kai furrowed his brows, glancing curiously at Mu Nandou, "Why are you people from the Xuan Guang Association still here?"

Mu Nandou hurriedly replied, "Reporting to Young Master Kai, from now on, everyone in the Xuan Guang Association will obey your commands!"

"What’s going on?" Yang Kai asked, increasingly puzzled.

"It’s like this, Young Master," Pang Chi said, stepping forward to explain.

Last night, after he entered the hall to break through, Huo Xingchen and those two experts pooled their silver tickets and managed to scrape together a few hundred thousand taels.

Seeing that Huo Xingchen looked somewhat displeased, Pang Chi suggested that they write an IOU. After all, he was the son of the Huo Family and wouldn’t dare renege.

What was meant as good intentions didn’t go as planned; Huo Xingchen refused adamantly and even ended up beating Pang Chi.

After thinking for a moment, Huo Xingchen then offered the entire Xuan Guang Association as collateral!

After giving Mu Nandou orders to pledge allegiance to Yang Kai, Huo Xingchen swaggered away with the two experts from the Huo Family, leaving the group from the Xuan Guang Association dumbfounded.

With over a thousand people in the Xuan Guang Association, which Huo Xingchen had developed as his own small force for amusement, it was now treated like an object, changing hands. Naturally, Mu Nandou and others felt sour in their hearts.

Even if bitter, Mu Nandou didn’t dare voice any complaints, only standing there with his group, waiting for Yang Kai’s arrival.

Once Pang Chi finished explaining, Mu Nandou's heart couldn’t help but race as he secretly observed Yang Kai's reactions and expressions, wanting to know how he would arrange for them.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai remained silent, and his expression was exceedingly bland, giving no indication of what he was thinking.

Mu Nandou couldn’t help but feel anxious and quickly said, "Actually, Huo Young Master’s actions don’t put you at a disadvantage, Young Master Kai."

"How so?" Yang Kai glanced over at him.

Mu Nandou felt a flicker of joy, knowing he had hit the mark, and hurriedly said, "The Xuan Guang Association has also accumulated quite a bit of wealth over the years. If we collateralize it, it should be enough to cover last night's losses."

"How much?"

"There are at least a few million taels. Over the years, Huo Young Master has also rewarded us with some, which we’ve saved up."

Yang Kai nodded, suddenly asking, "How does the Xuan Guang Association rank among other forces in Zhongdu?"

"Not quite strong and not too weak either," Mu Nandou forced a laugh, "It’s not considered a major force."

"What if we were to merge with the Bamboo Segment Gang?" 

"That would absolutely allow us to become one of the top fifteen forces." Mu Nandou puffed with confidence.

"Then let’s merge, and henceforth there will be no more Xuan Guang Association!" Yang Kai looked at Pang Chi. "You will take him as your deputy from now on!"

"Understood!" Pang Chi rejoiced, while Mu Nandou, despite his bittersweet expression, didn’t dare utter any complaints and could only smile in agreement.

Having accumulated so much wealth in the Xuan Guang Association, Yang Kai suddenly realized he had somewhat underestimated these minor forces; not every small force was as impoverished as the Bamboo Segment Gang.

With a broad smile, Yang Kai said, "I want you to get familiar with each other quickly, and then... go and consume those smaller forces that are weaker than you."

"Ah!" Pang Chi exclaimed in surprise, while Mu Nandou maintained an ordinary expression.

"This... isn’t this inappropriate?" Pang Chi hesitated. For the past few years, the Bamboo Segment Gang had never aimed to attack others, focusing solely on self-preservation. Suddenly becoming bandits left him hesitant.

"What do you think?" Yang Kai glanced at Mu Nandou.

He quickly responded, "There’s nothing inappropriate about it; it’s the survival of the fittest. If Young Master Kai hadn’t emerged last night, the Bamboo Segment Gang would have been finished. In Zhongdu, conflicts and usurpations among these minor forces are commonplace; Pang Chi, your mindset is too conservative."

Pang Chi felt a flush of heat and stammered but couldn’t articulate his thoughts.

"Looks like you Xuan Guang Association often does these kinds of things," Yang Kai looked deeply at Mu Nandou, who awkwardly smiled and said, "Mainly to entertain Young Master Huo. So far, we’ve only done it twice. However, I’ve figured out which forces are ripe for picking; I just wait for when Young Master Huo feels bored, and I’ll lead him to the excitement, heh heh..."

Now with a new master, Mu Nandou naturally wanted to make a good impression. Seeing Yang Kai was genuinely interested, he started to elaborate eagerly.

Pang Chi instantly sensed something was awry. If Mu Nandou continued speaking, he might end up losing his position as the leader, so he quickly expressed, "With Brother Mu’s help, I think we can indeed go and consume others."

"Then we’ll do just that," Yang Kai nodded decisively, "Once we obtain wealth, keep a portion for yourselves to develop, and convert the rest entirely into materials for alchemy and artifact crafting, of at least Earth-Grade Upper-Level quality."

"Understood!" Pang Chi and Mu Nandou replied respectfully, exchanging glances, knowing Yang Kai was preparing for the battle over inheritance.

Not daring to delay, they excused themselves and led their respective groups back into the main hall to plot.

After standing in place for a moment, Yang Kai couldn't help but laugh in astonishment. He had not anticipated Huo Xingchen would make such a move.

However, it didn’t come as a loss; the increase in useful subordinates would only allow things to grow larger like a snowball.

……

In Fourth Master Yang's residence.

Upon Yang Kai's return, the butler immediately approached him, "Young Master, the master has ordered you to hurry to the study; he has important matters to discuss."

"Got it." Yang Kai responded and quickly headed to the study, wondering what Fourth Master Yang wanted to discuss with him.

Arriving in front of the study door, he hadn’t even entered when he heard Dong Suzhu's voice from inside, "Don’t rush, Kai’er should be back soon."

Yang Yingfeng complained, "As his mother, don’t you know when your son left the house?"

Dong Suzhu retorted, "Aren't you equally clueless? Why come to blame others now? Are you even being reasonable?"

Fourth Master Yang felt quite helpless.

Inside the room, muffled chuckles could be heard, suppressed yet struggling.

Yang Kai's expression shifted, and a smile appeared on his face as he pushed the door open and stepped inside.

Upon seeing Yang Kai return, Dong Suzhu immediately stood up, biting her silver teeth, "You little brat, where were you last night? You didn’t come back overnight and only return at this hour, causing me to be scolded by your father."

While speaking, she leaned forward and sniffed.

"What are you sniffing for?" Fourth Master Yang asked suspiciously.

"Just checking if he went to drink last night!" Dong Suzhu’s expression was extremely serious; after sniffing for a bit, she nodded with relief and said, "Good, there’s no smell of alcohol and no trace of rouge…"

"Don't make a scene!" Yang Kai said helplessly, gesturing to the side, "There are outsiders here."

"Oh…"
