## Chapter 2004 — Giant Ore Chunk

Previously, Yang Kai had already sensed that Zhao and Sun were acting strangely.

After all, that Iron-Armed Shenni's cave had been dark and damp, not to mention foul-smelling, yet after obtaining the Golden Crystal Herb they still remained behind to sit in meditation and recover — that clearly suggested something was up.

If there were no other benefit down there, why would they choose to linger in such an environment?

So Yang Kai pretended to leave, but in truth he hid nearby, quietly observing.

The moment he sensed traces of them using power, he immediately confirmed the judgment in his mind.

However, in the current situation, Yang Kai was not in a position to kill them and take their gains — after all, although Zhao and Sun had hidden things from him, they had not truly harmed him; he could only blame himself for being somewhat inexperienced.

It looked like it was time to bone up on knowledge about the various materials in the Star Realm, otherwise he would surely suffer similar losses in the future.

Yang Kai did not know what exactly within the ground had prompted Zhao and Sun to mobilize so boldly to excavate, but since he could not conveniently show himself, he naturally could only remain hidden.

Sounds of movement continued coming from over there, and before long the cave floor had been dug into a large pit; Zhao and Sun leapt in one after the other and resumed digging.

After a full half day, the two of them shot out of the cave mouth one after the other, but rather than looking pleased they both frowned deeply, appearing to have found nothing.

"Damn it, what rotten luck — we wasted half a day's work for nothing," complained the man surnamed Zhao.

"Yeah, who would have thought it would be like this. If we'd known, we should have left right away," sighed the man surnamed Sun.

"Forget it — it's fate, you can't force it. We'd better hurry and find an entrance to the second layer; who knows when the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda will close. We need to gather more gains, especially that Dao Origin Fruit — that would be of great use to both of us!"

In a few words, the two had no intention of lingering further. They each produced their flying Secret Treasures and shot off into the sky.

A moment later, Yang Kai's figure suddenly appeared from the void, staring in the direction the two had vanished, his face wearing a thoughtful expression.

Judging from their earlier talk, it seemed they had not fallen upon any great gain below the cave; otherwise they would not have been so frustrated — but from their words it also seemed they had not explicitly said there was nothing of value underground.

This left Yang Kai completely baffled.

His figure flickered and he returned to the cave, moving to the deepest part; when he looked carefully he saw a large pit before him.

Yang Kai leapt into it.

Before long his feet struck the ground, and when he expanded his Divine Sense the situation below immediately became clear.

Zhao and Sun had indeed worked efficiently — after all, they were Void King Realm cultivators of the Third Stage — and in merely half a day they had dug out an underground chamber occupying roughly a hundred zhang in diameter.

Moreover, there was not the slightest sign of collapse.

Yang Kai watched in astonishment and could not help admiring their technique.

“But within that cavern, spanning hundreds of zhang, there existed only a single thing — a colossal, perfectly intact chunk of ore!”

The ore's kind was unknown; it gave off a pale cyan hue across its whole body, as if covered with a layer of moss, though on closer inspection the color was part of the stone itself.

The edges of the ore had been exposed by mining, so Yang Kai could see clearly that the rock was irregularly shaped but fully the size of ten houses.

Not far before Yang Kai, the ore still bore signs of having been struck.

The marks were many — some a few cun deep, others merely scratches.

These traces were clearly left by Zhao and Sun during their earlier attempts.

Yang Kai suddenly understood why Zhao and Sun had appeared so frustrated when they left the cave earlier.

It turned out the underground held benefits after all, but those benefits were beyond the two of them — they could only look on in frustration.

So massive a piece of ore could not fit into anyone's Spatial Ring; Zhao and Sun obviously knew this, so they had tried to chip pieces off to carry away, and those remaining marks were the best evidence.

Unfortunately the ore seemed extraordinarily hard; despite Zhao and Sun's strength they could not break it and in the end had to abandon it to avoid wasting time.

Yang Kai, however, looked on with shining eyes and chuckled.

His own Spatial Ring was no different from others and naturally could not hold such a massive ore, but besides the Spatial Ring he also had the Xuan Realm Pearl!

Back when his Incarnation had been that large, Yang Kai had stuffed it directly into the Xuan Realm Pearl; a rock of this size would be nothing by comparison.

It was far more compact and delicate than his former Incarnation had been.

Since this ore existed on the first layer of the Five-Colored Treasure Pagoda, it was certainly not an Imperial-Grade mineral; Yang Kai estimated it at most Dao Origin-Grade, or perhaps Void King-Grade.

Even so, given its sheer size it was still immensely valuable.

His Incarnation now practiced the Heaven Devouring Battle Art and required large amounts of material to devour and refine; this ore could serve perfectly as a resource to strengthen the Incarnation.

With that in mind he did not hesitate further; he sat cross-legged, then unleashed his Divine Sense, using his own awareness to completely envelop the giant ore.

Then Yang Kai gave a muffled shout as the power of his Divine Sense poured forth in full force.

In the next moment the massive ore vanished from sight and reappeared within the Small Xuan Realm.

After finishing, Yang Kai's body swayed and his face turned a little pale; a needle-like pain pricked his skull.

He did not panic, but hurriedly took a Spiritual Pill to restore his Divine Sense and began to refine and absorb it.

Time slowly passed, and after another half day Yang Kai finally breathed out and slowly opened his eyes.

His expended Divine Sense had largely recovered; with the aid of the Warm Spirit Lotus his recovery speed was dozens of times faster than an ordinary person, otherwise at his current realm and after that exertion it would have taken at least ten days to half a month to recover before he could act again.

Scanning the Small Xuan Realm with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai found the giant ore had already been moved beside his Incarnation.

At the same time, the Incarnation itself looked somewhat different from before.

Though still a towering mountain-like colossus, it was undeniably much smaller than the last time Yang Kai had seen it, and around the Incarnation the slag that had been refined had already piled up to a layer ten zhang high — a thick accumulation.

As Yang Kai watched for a while, more discarded broken stones constantly fell from the Incarnation, rumbling one after another, a truly magnificent sight.

Yang Kai was greatly satisfied; at this rate, in as little as half a year or at most a year, the Incarnation would be able to assist him, and he would no longer be hampered by its clumsiness.

He withdrew his Divine Sense, leapt out of the pit, checked his bearings outside, and then departed directly.

……

Seven days later Yang Kai frowned as he gazed at the nearby mountain range, a trace of anxiety appearing on his face.

In those days he had been searching for an entrance to the second layer but had been unable to find one.

Qin Yu's words still rang in his ears; he did not think she had lied, so he followed her directions and examined places with mountain ranges.

He checked several locations in succession, all to no avail.

He could not be certain whether the mountain range ahead was the target he sought.

But one must at least go and have a look.

His figure flickered and Yang Kai moved forward.

It was not long before he arrived between that group of mountains; he looked up and could not help smiling.

The peaks encircled the area and a mist steamed up overhead, fitting well with the first two lines Qin Yu had spoken.

Just as he felt he must have found the right place, a small black shadow suddenly shot toward him; Yang Kai instinctively reached out and brushed, his powerful force issuing from his palm toward the shadow.

The shadow reacted with incredible speed; it had been flying straight at him, but at the instant Yang Kai moved it suddenly turned ninety degrees and shot into the sky, then fell like a meteor, emitting a continuous series of squeaks.

Its tone sounded somewhat aggrieved and anxious.

Yang Kai stood dumbfounded, frozen in place, watching the shadow that had suddenly targeted him.

Only then did he see clearly that the shadow was a demonic beast roughly the size of a palm, somewhat bat-like; its wings beat thin and nimble, and its speed was extraordinary.

The little bat-like demonic beast hovered before Yang Kai, its small eyes staring at him with a look of recognition.

Yang Kai was surprised.

Before he could figure out what the beast intended, it let out a flurry of squeaks, opened its mouth, and spat out a jade slip, signaling toward Yang Kai.

"For me?" Yang Kai frowned, but he understood the little beast's intention.

The creature squeaked again as if replying, then slowly flew to him; when it relaxed its mouth the jade slip dropped.

Yang Kai took the jade slip and poured his Divine Sense into it; after a moment he burst out laughing hoarsely, "So it's Xiaoqi..."

Only then did he realize this little beast was the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat raised by Mo Xiaoqi, left here to receive him and guide his way.

A warm feeling rose in Yang Kai's heart.

It seemed he had indeed found the right place, and Mo Xiaoqi had managed to reach the second layer far earlier than he had — impressive.

"Lead the way ahead," Yang Kai pocketed the jade slip and smiled faintly at the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat.

The little beast seemed to understand speech; at his words it immediately turned and flew off in a direction.

But at that moment a clear voice suddenly called from not far away: "Friend, wait!"

With the words came the sound of fluttering robes.

Yang Kai's face darkened — he had been so surprised by the bat's intelligence that he had not noticed someone approaching; upon hearing the voice he immediately reacted.

Scanning with his Divine Sense, Yang Kai knew there were six cultivators nearby, each of them Void King Realm.
