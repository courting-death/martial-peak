## Chapter 1892 — Secret Talk

All the cultivation techniques and secret arts Yang Kai had were scavenged from the Purple Star Treasure Vault.

Things stored in the Purple Star Treasure Vault—how could they be anything less than exceptional? You could say every manual and every secret art within was a closely guarded Purple Star secret, never meant to be passed down.

Yang Kai had originally intended to take these items back to Lingxiao Sect so the sect's disciples would have more choices, but since Biluo needed one, Yang Kai of course would not be stingy; he searched carefully among them, striving to find the most suitable technique for her.

Not long after, an ancient, unadorned tome appeared in Yang Kai's palm. He casually tossed it to Biluo and said, "This Fire Crow Tianrui Treasure Scroll should suit you well—have a look."

Biluo's face brightened and she hurriedly seized it, flipping through the pages.

Yang Kai said beside her, "This technique comprises upper, middle, and lower volumes and is extremely complete. The upper volume alone is enough to support your cultivation to the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, forming a pure fire‑attributed Saint Yuan within your body. The middle volume can support up to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm; if you can find a Fire Crow Inner Core or its origin force and refine it into your body, this technique's power will rise another level, and cultivating to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm would not be a problem. The lower volume contains several accompanying divine techniques and secret arts; cultivate them at your discretion."

When he had been looking for techniques earlier, Yang Kai had briefly read through this one and found it indeed well suited to Biluo, which was why he took it out.

The strength of this Fire Crow Tianrui Treasure Scroll lay in its ability to search for a Fire Crow Inner Core or origin force to boost its power.

The Fire Crow was a kind of ancient beast; although not as famous as true dragons or true phoenixes, and even a notch below the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider, it was on the same rank as a Xiezhi. Rumor said this ancient beast even carried a trace of Fire Phoenix bloodline, though whether that was true no one knew.

If aided by a Fire Crow Inner Core or origin force, this technique's power could increase by at least ten percent.

That was an unimaginably great improvement.

Yang Kai's words reached Biluo, who was full of delight; she excitedly turned the pages, eager to begin cultivating.

A Fire Crow's Inner Core and origin force might be hard to find elsewhere, but this was Yao Star Di Chen, the yao's paradise—perhaps remnants of the Fire Crow bloodline remained.

For this very reason, Yang Kai had specially selected this technique for Biluo.

Biluo finished reading at great speed. Only then did she solemnly store the Fire Crow Tianrui Treasure Scroll into her Spatial Ring. Her lovely eyes shone as she looked at Yang Kai and said softly, "Thank you!"

"No need," Yang Kai smiled faintly. "You can constantly remain by Qingluo's side and never abandon her. I should be the one thanking you."

"Accompanying my lord is a matter of course. I have noted your favor. When there is an opportunity I will properly thank you."

Yang Kai said no more.

Biluo could not contain her impatience and said, "Then you rest well; I'll go study this technique first."

"Go on," Yang Kai waved his hand.

After Biluo left, Yang Kai thought for a moment, took out his Purple Void Cauldron and a number of precious medicinal ingredients, and set up a furnace to refine pills in the room.

Time drifted by; a few days passed.

One day, while Yang Kai was refining pills, Chi Yue's voice suddenly sounded at his ear: "Kid, come to my bedchamber!"

Yang Kai's expression turned serious; he looked up and smiled, "Senior, wait a moment."

After finishing the pill he was working on, Yang Kai packed his things and headed toward Chi Yue's bedchamber.

He had been to Chi Yue's bedchamber once before, so this time he was familiar with the route and required no guide.

But when he entered, he found the innermost side room blocked by a barrier; an extremely profound power fluctuation issued from within, and through the barrier Yang Kai could faintly make out Chi Yue's figure.

He instantly realized Chi Yue was still in seclusion, and had to split off part of her spirit to receive him.

Chi Yue's voice came from ahead, "I heard from Yu Xiong that you came to Di Chen Star on purpose? What do you want?"

Yang Kai replied, "One sentence can't explain it. How about this—senior will understand by looking at this jade slip."

Saying so, Yang Kai took a jade slip from his Spatial Ring, poured Divine Sense into it, engraved some information within, and casually tossed it forward.

The barrier opened a crack and then silently shut again.

The side room was dead silent; Yang Kai understood Chi Yue was inspecting the jade slip and did not press, instead standing quietly to wait.

After a short while, an unsettled surge of power suddenly washed through the side chamber—as if Chi Yue had been provoked and her Saint Yuan wavered. Still, she was a mighty presence on the verge of ascending to Yao King; after exerting some spirit and will she managed to force that disturbance back under control.

A trembling voice issued from the side room, filled with incredulity: "You personally saw the Starry Sky Emperor? And lived with her for more than a decade?"

"I did see the Emperor, but the one I lived with was an incarnation of the Emperor, not her true body."

"Although I do not think you would lie to me, such a fact is too difficult to believe. It's not that I doubt you, but... what evidence do you have?"

Yang Kai nodded slightly. "It's normal for you to have doubts. As for evidence... is this enough?"

As he spoke, Yang Kai produced seven Star Emperor Tokens and at the same time manifested the Extinction Thunder Bead.

Strands of Imperial Might spread out; Yang Kai strove to release a Domain Field to contain the Imperial Might at his side so it would not interfere with Chi Yue.

Yet Chi Yue was still shocked: "You have already gathered so many Star Emperor Tokens? And that lightning‑attributed bead—what is it?"

"An Imperial Treasure! The Extinction Thunder Bead," Yang Kai explained calmly, "It belonged to the Emperor back then; she gave it to me."

"An Imperial Treasure!" Chi Yue cried out in astonishment. Had she not been in the midst of an important seclusion, she might have rushed out to take a look; even so, her voice carried unimaginable shock.

"So you have indeed heard of Imperial Treasures."

"At my age, what haven't I heard of?" Chi Yue snorted, but her tone soon brimmed with envy. "You actually obtained an Imperial Treasure from the Emperor—looks like what your jade slip said wasn't false."

"Junior would not joke about such matters with you," Yang Kai said earnestly.

"Hmm, as you say—there are many Star Domains like the one we inhabit? Only because of boundary forces we cannot probe them or enter other Star Domains?"

"I haven't confirmed that either; it was the Emperor who told me so."

"If the Emperor said so, then it should be true. Above Star Domains there is a Star Realm? And above the Void King Realm there are still higher tiers?"

"Exactly!"

Chi Yue suddenly laughed, her voice deep: "I had indeed not guessed wrongly. The path of the Martial Dao has no end—who can truly stand at the summit? Above the Void King Realm there are, as suspected, still broader paths!"

Her tone was elated; she was immensely pleased to have her long‑held speculation validated.

Yang Kai understood: to any warrior who yearned for greater strength, being told the Martial Dao had a limit would be crushing. Learning of this secret would not make them despondent but would instead stir an eager pursuit.

"Kid, you came to Di Chen seeking me because opening the path to the Star Realm lacks manpower, right?" Chi Yue suddenly asked in a clear, sharp tone.

"Yes," Yang Kai nodded. "According to the Emperor, to open a passage to the Star Realm one first needs to gather nine Star Emperor Tokens. That should not be a major problem—I currently have seven."

"The remaining two?"

"One is with the Hengluo Commerce Guild, the other with the Sword Alliance."

"Do you have a way to obtain them? You must know those are the Emperor's artifacts; these two major forces are not easy to deal with and likely won't let you take them without a fight."

"Where there's a will, there's a way," Yang Kai smiled.

"Good. You first try to collect them; if you truly cannot, after I ascend to Yao King I will personally go to the home stars of these two great forces and demand their Star Emperor Tokens—then we'll see who dares refuse," Chi Yue said proudly.

Yang Kai's expression darkened. "Leave it to me; it should be no problem."

"Then the second requirement is to assemble six people at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm—how many have you found?"

"Uh... for now there's only Senior. But judging by your tone, you will help, which saves me some persuasion."

Yang Kai had come to Di Chen to ask Chi Yue for help. He knew Chi Yue was already a powerful expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm and, after obtaining the Void Mind Crystal from Yao King Feng E, would probably begin to push toward the Third Stage. There was still a long time before the ten‑year term Yang Kai had agreed with the Ghost Ancestor, so he wanted to drop by Di Chen and greet Chi Yue.

He had prepared a speech to persuade her.

But from Chi Yue's words it was clear she was highly interested in the matter and required no persuasion.

"Agree—why wouldn't I agree! The Void King Realm is not the end of my Martial Dao; the Emperor is my ultimate goal. Such an opportunity I would not miss. However... across the entire Star Domain, it may not be possible to gather six people at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; that is rather difficult."

Chi Yue understood that assembling nine Star Emperor Tokens and gathering six Third Stage Void King experts—the latter was the more difficult task.

No one knew where those Third Stage experts hid, so hunting them down would be exceedingly hard.

Purple Star did have a Kuang Shizong, but given Yang Kai's enmity with Purple Star, Kuang Shizong certainly would not agree to the matter; and even if he did, Yang Kai would not bring him along.

"This actually isn't that hard," Yang Kai smiled. "Senior can count as one, I might count as another, and in my sect there is one person striving to reach the Third Stage; if he succeeds, that will make three."

"Three... still only halfway there!" Chi Yue exclaimed.

Yang Kai smiled, "I believe that if we publicize the jade slip's information, people will voluntarily come forward. Senior should understand—those old monsters who stay hidden are precisely those exploring higher Martial Dao. Now that I can point them a path, they will certainly flock to it."

"So you had planned this all along."

"Of course. This is only the last resort; if we truly cannot gather the necessary people we'll do that, though I would much prefer to find suitable candidates."
