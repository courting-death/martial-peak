## Chapter 1817 — The Sixth Star Emperor Token

Yang Kai regained consciousness, stowed away Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan, then cast another glance at his Incarnation; receiving the information it fed back, he instantly understood what the Incarnation and the Ghost Ancestor had just discussed.

After a slight nod he formed hand seals with both hands; a vast Divine Sense surged forth like a tide, enveloping the Incarnation.

The next moment the Incarnation vanished before his eyes.

The Ghost Ancestor once again gaped in shock, his trembling finger pointing at Yang Kai. “You… you… just how big is your Spatial Ring, that you can even store your own Incarnation inside it?”

He found it inconceivable; that Incarnation had been a stone giant standing thirty zhang high, and it had simply disappeared into nothingness—if it hadn’t been taken into Yang Kai’s Spatial Ring, what else could it be?

Yang Kai smiled faintly. “I didn’t put it into the Spatial Ring. I sent it somewhere else.”

The place the Incarnation went to was naturally the world inside the Xuan Realm Pearl; a Spatial Ring could not possibly accommodate such an existence.

The Ghost Ancestor slapped his forehead, his face full of bitter grievance. “This old man counts as a master in his own right—there aren’t many things left in this world that can still move me. But traveling with you, boy… tch, my poor heart keeps taking hits every now and then.”

The sights and events of this period had all exceeded his comprehension.

Yang Kai laughed heartily. “Get used to being rattled.”

This battle had indeed been intense, especially when Zi Long tried to self-destruct at the last moment; if Yang Kai had not held an Imperial Treasure like the Extinction Thunder Bead, he would likely have had to flee with the Ghost Ancestor.

Who could stop the Self-Destruction of a Void King Realm expert at the Second Stage?

Only the strike of the Extinction Thunder Bead could utterly obliterate such an attack.

Yet that blow had also drained Yang Kai’s strength. Though effective, that thing was terribly harmful to use.

The memory of his internal power being emptied and his body left weak still left Yang Kai with a lingering chill.

“Enough of that—let’s see what we gained this time.” Yang Kai changed the subject, flipped his hand, and four Spatial Rings appeared in his palm.

These four Spatial Rings were all high-grade, naturally belonging to the four people Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor had slain earlier.

At the sight of them the Ghost Ancestor’s eyes glittered; he rubbed his hands together in eager anticipation.

He loved nothing more than killing and looting; although he had not done it often, every time he did he profited greatly.

Moreover, among these four rings three belonged to Void King Realm practitioners, and the remaining one, though only Origin Returning Realm, had belonged to Zi Donglai—the Young Master of Purple Star—so its contents should be exceedingly rich.

Yang Kai casually pinched one ring; his Divine Sense swept through it and his face immediately darkened as he cursed, “Whose damn ring is this—there’s nothing good at all? So poor?”

“No way?” The Ghost Ancestor was stunned, took the ring from Yang Kai and scanned it with his Divine Sense, then swore in turn: “Damn, such a pauper dares to show his face out here?”

That ring’s owner was unknown, and inside were only a few tens of thousands of Saint Crystals and a bunch of miscellaneous items of little value.

“I can sense Xu Wei’s aura—looks like it was that old bastard’s.” The Ghost Ancestor sneered, indignant: “Good riddance to him.”

They had no idea that the good things in Xu Wei’s ring had been divided up by Zi Long and Zi Donglai; it would have been strange if there had been anything of value left.

“Ah, this one’s not bad!” Yang Kai checked another ring and brightened; clearly it stored plentiful treasures. He tossed it to the Ghost Ancestor and said, “Grand Elder, have a look—take what you need. Give me whatever you don’t want.”

“Sect Master, you’re too generous—hah, I won’t refuse.” The Ghost Ancestor had long been solitary and rarely found good cultivation materials; with so many fine things before him, he could not resist. He grabbed the ring and began rifling through it, his face alight. “Tsk, it contains Hengjin Star Sand—this is precious; with it one could forge Void King-Grade secret treasures. I’ve heard it only yields sparsely in the Spine of the Star River. Looks like this was Kong Fa’s ring—hiss… so many medicinal materials; that old fellow netted a fair harvest even in the Lost Realm.”

“Don’t touch the medicinal herbs. When we return to Lingxiao Sect I’ll have someone refine them into pills for you.” Yang Kai said offhandedly.

“I know.” The Ghost Ancestor grinned.

After a moment Yang Kai tossed another ring over; the Ghost Ancestor pillaged it as well, then returned the remaining items to Yang Kai.

“Only one left—looks like Zi Long’s ring. I’m excited; as the lord of Purple Star he won’t be lacking good things, right?” The Ghost Ancestor wiped the drool from his mouth, his eyes gleaming green with avarice.

Yang Kai examined it briefly and his expression turned odd. “There are indeed many good things, but there’s this…”

He produced a Secret Treasure shaped like a round bowl. The bowl looked plain, but it emitted an aura that made the soul exceedingly comfortable.

“Isn’t this what Zi Long used just now?” The Ghost Ancestor’s eyes widened. “By the gods, it’s forged from Soul-Nurturing Wood—no wonder it can gather the souls of the dead. Purple Star is not to be underestimated.”

Yang Kai chuckled softly and said calmly, “It is, after all, one of the strongest forces in the entire Star Domain. Without some real skill, it would’ve been wiped out long ago.”

As he spoke a light flashed in his eyes and pure soul energy poured into the Soul-Fixing Bowl. He shouted coldly, “Get out!”

The next instant a piteous howl rang from within the bowl and a phantom figure materialized inside.

It was Zi Donglai.

Bearing the pain in his soul, he looked around bewildered; when he saw Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor grinning lecherously at him, his face changed instantly. “Why are you here?”

“Who else would it be?” the Ghost Ancestor sneered, and Zi Donglai’s soul-body trembled as if about to collapse.

“Where is my father? Where is my father?” Zi Donglai cried in panic. He had hidden within the Soul-Fixing Bowl thinking that the next time he emerged his father would restore him a body—but he had not expected to see these two loathsome faces the moment he came out; he was nearly bereft of his three spirits and almost died of fright.

“We walked away unscathed—how do you think Zi Long met his end?” Yang Kai sneered.

Zi Donglai’s face drained of color and he blurted in utter disbelief, “Impossible! My father is the lord of Purple Star, a Second Stage Void King Realm expert—few in this world could kill him. You two alone could never have done such a thing!”

As he spoke his confidence seemed to harden, and he pointed at Yang Kai, shouting, “Don’t you dare lie to me!”

“Ha!” Yang Kai scoffed. “What would I gain by lying? I’m not interested in wasting words. Grand Elder, your Ghost Banner should need Yin-Soul nourishment, right? This brat’s yours.”

“Heh heh… no problem.” The Ghost Ancestor laughed oddly and produced the Ten Thousand Souls Banner. “He’s at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; after refinement he’ll give my banner a fine boost.”

Faces twisted in the fabric of the banner, countless contorted visages surged forth, roaring as if they smelled a delicious feast, clawing at Zi Donglai.

Zi Donglai, terrified beyond himself, shrank to one side inside the Soul-Fixing Bowl and cried, “Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me! I’m the Young Master of Purple Star—let’s negotiate. Whatever you want I’ll give you.”

“You fool—what could you give me now?” The Ghost Ancestor snorted coldly. “Come into my Ten Thousand Souls Banner obediently!”

“Star Emperor Token!” At that moment Yang Kai suddenly cried out, his face alight with ecstasy. He snatched a token from Zi Long’s Spatial Ring, examined it from all sides and laughed: “It really is a Star Emperor Token!”

The Ghost Ancestor stared at him in astonishment. “Why the excitement? Didn’t I give you a Star Emperor Token before? That one was already unsealed and useless.”

Yang Kai’s joy did not lessen as he looked at the Ghost Ancestor. “Grand Elder, you don’t know—there are said to be earth-shattering secrets hidden within these Star Emperor Tokens. If one could gather nine of them, the secret could be revealed.”

“Earth-shattering secrets?” The Ghost Ancestor feigned indifference. “Will they allow me to reach the pinnacle of Martial Dao?”

“Maybe… maybe they can!” a weak voice whispered.

Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor both stared at Zi Donglai; that voice had come from him.

“What do you know?” Yang Kai asked sternly. As the Young Master of Purple Star, he might actually know something about the Star Emperor Tokens.

Zi Donglai steadied himself and pleaded toward the Ghost Ancestor, “Elder, could you please put away that treasure? I… I’m so afraid.”

“Useless.” The Ghost Ancestor snorted and retracted the Ten Thousand Souls Banner.

Zi Donglai then slumped back into the Soul-Fixing Bowl, wiped the nonexistent sweat from his brow and, after catching his breath, asked cautiously, “If I tell you what I know, will you let me go?”

“Grand Elder, take him and devour him!” Yang Kai shouted.

“With pleasure!” The Ghost Ancestor once more raised the Ten Thousand Souls Banner.

“No, no, no—please, I’ll talk, I’ll talk.” Zi Donglai was nearly in floods of tears.

“Scum!” Yang Kai curled his lip.

“Speak quickly!” The Ghost Ancestor continued to intimidate, at times stirring the banner’s violent aura to bear down on Zi Donglai’s mind.

With his voice trembling and sobbing, Zi Donglai wailed, “I don’t know much… but once I overheard my father and several elders mention the Star Emperor Tokens. They said that if nine were gathered, one could catch a glimpse of the Great Emperor’s secret!”

The bodies of Yang Kai and the Ghost Ancestor trembled violently at those words.

“Is that true?” Yang Kai pressed Zi Donglai.

“That’s what I heard… and they said it was the Emperor himself who spoke of it. You probably don’t know—my Purple Star ancestors had dealings with the Great Emperor tens of thousands of years ago… I only know that much, please don’t hurt me, I don’t want to die!”
