## Chapter 425 — Bloody Battle

The crowd surged forward, each person beaming with joy as Yang Kang and his group sped toward the northeast.

Although War City was not as vast as Zhongdu, it was still a colossal fortress compared to most other cities. Otherwise, the Yang Family would never have chosen it as the battleground for the succession war.

Without a vast space to serve as a battleground for protracted struggles, the succession war simply could not proceed.

Yang Kang's group flew at a steady, unhurried pace, their expressions relaxed. They even found the leisure to chat and joke along the way, enjoying themselves thoroughly.

After nearly half an hour, they arrived at the northeast section of War City.

In front of the residence of Third Brother Yang Tie, Yang Kang and the others landed calmly. The bored onlookers who had followed to witness the spectacle quickly scrambled to advantageous spots, ceasing their steps and eagerly awaiting the developments.

Yang Kai, accompanied by the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians, also landed at a moderate distance, silently awaiting the show’s commencement.

“Third Brother, Fifth Brother has arrived!” Yang Kang called out from outside the residence with a slight smile.

“Since you’re here, come in,” Yang Tie’s voice came from within.

Yang Kang smiled faintly and led the large group inside without haste. Though Yang Tie’s voice was steady and composed, anyone could perceive the hidden sense of weakness and loneliness beneath it.

Despite his years of training outside, Yang Tie had been unable to earn any notable merits or to command the loyalty of Blood Servants. Without the protection of Blood Servants or the support of other powers, relying solely on his mother’s family’s aid was insufficient to achieve anything.

Qiu Yimeng’s initial judgment was largely correct—Third Brother Yang Tie was destined to be the first to fall.

Within the courtyard, Yang Tie stood upright and resolute, flanked by two formidable experts at the Seventh Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, as well as several other martial artists of reasonable strength. All these warriors hailed from the Duanmu family, his mother’s clan.

And the Duanmu family was the only source of support Yang Tie had in the succession war.

Tonight’s survival depended wholly on the power of the Duanmu family.

In contrast, Yang Kang was accompanied not only by Tang Yuxian, a powerful Blood Servant adept in soul techniques, but also by Gao Rangfeng of the Gao Family, one of the Eight Great Families, who brought along two experts of the Fifth Stage Divine Roaming Realm.

Both these Fifth Stage experts were no ordinary warriors—by standard measures, they could defeat even an Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm cultivator.

Additionally, several other Divine Roaming Realm experts, along with dozens of True Essence Realm martial artists, supported Yang Kang’s forces. The disparity in strength was obvious.

Yang Kang could afford to deploy only half his strength and still effectively restrain all of Yang Tie’s allies. At that moment, capturing Yang Tie himself or seizing his command flag would be as simple as breathing. Both person and flag could be exchanged for much-needed resources within the Xiang Family.

Yang Tie’s eyes calmly fixed on the approaching Yang Kang, an indifferent expression on his face.

Yang Kang stopped ten zhang away. The brothers held each other’s gaze for a moment before Yang Kang smiled and said, “Third Brother, we are brothers. Let me offer you some advice—why don’t we settle this peacefully?”

He clearly hoped to avoid bloodshed and have Yang Tie surrender voluntarily. Holding an absolute advantage, he felt justified in speaking this way.

Upon hearing this, Yang Tie shook his head slowly and firmly. “As a scion of the Yang Family, we know only defeat—not surrender. Even if you are my brother, that will never be.”

“Very well, I expected as much,” Yang Kang nodded lightly, his smile fading. “If that is the case, do not blame me for showing no mercy.”

“By all means!” Yang Tie’s expression grew stern.

The Duanmu family warriors behind him began concentrating their True Essence, warily prepared.

At this moment, Tang Yuxian, who never left Yang Kang’s side, suddenly frowned and muttered something quietly.

Yang Kang’s expression turned playful as he glanced back and announced loudly, “Seventh Brother, since you are here, why hide in the shadows? Step forward openly.”

Laughter rang out, followed by a group of people racing through the night sky to land in the courtyard, ready to challenge Yang Kang’s forces.

It was the seventh brother of the Yang Family, Yang Ying, along with his allies.

Yang Kang was allied with Gao Rangfeng of the Gao Family; Yang Ying counted Kang Zhan of the Kang Family among his allies and also brought a Blood Servant for protection. Though the two sides’ strength differed slightly, it was marginal.

The onlookers immediately grew excited. The three brothers of the Yang Family had gathered in one place—soon there would be an enthralling spectacle. Who, among Yang Kang and Yang Ying, would claim the prize of defeating Yang Tie?

“Third Brother, Fifth Brother, the seventh greets you,” Yang Ying said with a warm smile upon landing.

“Seventh, you are ruthless. If Tang Yuxian hadn’t noticed, I would have been slain unaware by your surprise attack,” Yang Kang laughed, shaking his head.

“Fifth Brother, with the succession war, all manners of stratagems are used. I merely hid briefly. Besides, I was also cautious—wondering if other brothers might be lurking amidst the crowd watching the battlefield.”

He glanced cautiously around as he spoke.

Yang Kai, his head covered by a hood that obscured his face, could not help but smile, while the Wind and Cloud Twin Guardians also felt the sensation of having their ruse exposed.

“There should be no more arrivals,” Yang Kang said, shaking his head slowly. “Tonight, Eldest Brother remains inactive. As the eldest, he gives others the courtesy of restraint. He won’t involve himself in the first battle. Eighth Brother is overly cautious now—only defending, never taking the initiative.”

Though Eighth Brother Yang Quan had a Blood Servant as an attendant, his mother’s family was only a second-tier power, with limited support. He had failed to rally many followers during the day and naturally did not dare or have the strength to attack others proactively.

Besides, his Blood Servant attendant made attacking him difficult, and no one had intentions to provoke him on the first night.

“Second Brother and Sixth Brother have probably taken their troops to another location that is easier to assault. So here, only the two of us remain.”

At this, Yang Kai raised his eyebrows and chuckled coldly.

Second Brother Yang Zhao and Sixth Brother Yang Shen had indeed gone to easier targets tonight—besides their own residences, there was nowhere else left to attack.

How the situation was unfolding there now was unknown.

Yang Kang spoke confidently, while Yang Ying chuckled silently in admiration. “Fifth Brother, your intelligence network is impressive. I respect you.”

Yang Kang shook his head. “Enough distraction. Let’s discuss how to deal with Third Brother here.”

“What’s your plan, Fifth Brother?”

“People and command flags. We each take one,” Yang Kang asked with a smile, as though discussing division of spoils with Yang Ying, completely disregarding Third Brother Yang Tie’s presence.

Yang Tie’s face darkened, while the Duanmu family warriors behind him bristled with anger.

Yang Ying smiled and shook his head calmly. “Fifth Brother, don’t blame me for being greedy. I want Third Brother’s people, and his command flag as well!”

Yang Kang was startled, laughing coldly. “Seventh Brother, your appetite is indeed large. Then let’s see if you have the skill to snatch food from the tiger’s mouth!”

Yang Ying’s smile faded, his expression turning grim.

The two brothers locked eyes, and the hundred-zhang radius around them fell silent, the Primordial Qi seeming to freeze in place.

Storm clouds approached; the city was about to be torn asunder.

Whoosh!

Over ten fierce Divine Sense attacks suddenly burst forth in unison, as if coordinated. The Divine Roaming Realm warriors brought by Yang Kang and Yang Ying unleashed their long-held soul techniques.

Invisible forces collided, some warriors groaned as they staggered back; others seized the opportunity to launch ferocious offensives.

Brilliant displays of martial skills and treasure light bloomed in an instant, dazzling the eyes.

Tang Yuxian leapt aside to avoid the whirlpool of battle, guarding Yang Kang, while the Blood Servant warrior accompanying Yang Ying similarly protected his master at another side.

The two Yang brothers watched each other tens of zhang apart, cold eyes clashing and sparking.

As key figures in the succession war, neither Yang Kang nor Yang Ying would strike personally unless absolutely necessary—not only because of the danger involved but also because their individual strength was limited; their actions would not significantly affect the broader situation.

The Blood Servant Hall experts protecting them were also bound by Yang Family rules, forbidding them from launching offensive strikes.

They could only counterattack passively. So long as no one attacked them or the Yang Family scions directly, they remained bystanders, even amid crisis.

The martial artists wielded by Yang Kang and Yang Ying were roughly evenly matched, and their skirmishes were closely contested.

Meanwhile, Yang Tie and the Duanmu family warriors observed coldly, unbothered, as none dared disturb them.

After a moment, Yang Tie snorted coldly. “Do you think Third Brother has no preparations? Release the arrows!”

Suddenly, ghostly figures appeared atop the courtyard walls and rooftops, holding formidable bows radiating shifting auras.

These powerfully crafted bows were high-grade treasures.

The archers wielding these bows were all of at least the Eighth Stage of the True Essence Realm, some perhaps even at the Divine Roaming Realm.

They madly poured True Essence into their bow treasures. In a very short time, every archer’s face turned pale—they had exhausted their reserves of True Essence.

The arrows on their strings pointed ominously below, raising alarm and dread.

A raging power amassed, chilling even the bored onlookers outside the residence. Their bodies trembled; their scalp prickled as if some unknown threat was fixating on them.

Whoosh…

Whoosh whoosh…

Six or seven bows twanged, arrows shimmering with blinding light as if meteors had fallen from the sky, trailing visible halos and striking the warriors fiercely engaged below.

The arrows arrived in an instant, weaving into a vast net that enclosed all the followers of Yang Kang and Yang Ying.

Loud explosions erupted—heaven crumbled, earth shattered, blood glowed suddenly, flesh flew.

Everyone’s eardrums vibrated violently; in that moment, they were deafened.

Yang Kang and Yang Ying’s eyes flickered with astonishment as they stared at the source of the energy burst.

Tang Yuxian and the other Blood Servant quickly circulated their True Essence to shield Yang Kang and Yang Ying.

The bloody battle had truly begun.
