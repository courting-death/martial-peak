## Chapter 486 — Young Master, This Day Has Finally Come

Standing in midair overlooking the entire battlefield, Qiu Yimeng felt a deep calm settle within her heart!

This battle seemed to no longer require Yang Kai. Yet if Yang Kai didn’t show up, their losses would undoubtedly be much greater.

Where the hell was that bastard? To falter at such a crucial moment.

As she cursed silently, the ears of Xiao Shun twitched suddenly beside her, and he grinned, “Miss Qiu, the Young Master has arrived.”

Qiu Yimeng’s joy blossomed at his words. She turned her head and sure enough, spotted a figure rapidly approaching nearby. In the blink of an eye, Yang Kai appeared before her.

Stopping beside Qiu Yimeng, Yang Kai casually cast a glance downward with a calm expression.

The state of the battle was roughly as he expected.

“I thought you weren’t coming,” Qiu Yimeng pouted.

“I was held up,” Yang Kai replied lightly.

“Something so important?” Qiu Yimeng’s mind raced, speaking without thinking—only to immediately clamp her lips shut and stare blankly at Yang Kai in shock. “You’ve broken through again?”

Young Miss Qiu was now at the First Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm and possessed Divine Sense. Unless Yang Kai deliberately concealed his aura, she would detect it instantly.

Now she understood why Yang Kai was late. On the verge of breakthrough, naturally he had no time to spare. Her expression softened considerably; in fact, she was somewhat pleased for him.

“Mm,” Yang Kai nodded slightly, gently clenching his fist. Ninth Stage of the True Yuan Realm, just one step away from reaching the Divine Roaming Realm! The power coursing through his body was undeniably far stronger than before.

“What we do next depends on your decision,” Qiu Yimeng said seriously, diverting the conversation back to the battle. Before Yang Kai could respond, she offered her suggestion: “To wipe them out completely might be unrealistic. I think we should settle for a favorable outcome. You lead Xiao Shun and Ying Jiu to capture Yang Kang. This would secure victory and allow us to take in any remaining survivors among the martial artists to strengthen our forces.”

Yang Kai shook his head slowly. “They can’t be recruited.”

“I know it’s difficult, but how can you be so certain without trying?” Qiu Yimeng frowned. Yang Kai was good at many things but often acted in a dogmatic, unilateral way. Once he made up his mind, others’ words were useless.

Recruiting the remnants was indeed a challenge. Just recently, both sides had fought to the death, their hands stained with each other’s blood.

“I said they can’t be recruited. That’s final.” Yang Kai clearly did not wish to argue further.

Qiu Yimeng fell silent and shot him a resentful glance. Though she did not show it, inwardly she agreed with Yang Kai.

Take the five Duanmu Family masters, for example. That night their clan suffered heavy casualties. If Yang Kang and Yang Ying tried to recruit them, would they submit? Certainly not.

This was a blood feud. Tonight’s battle had crushed powerful forces within Yang Kang’s residence. How could such bitter foes come to join Yang Kai?

Even if by some miracle they did, how would they live peacefully alongside Yang Kai’s original allies afterward? Blood enemies in close quarters would inevitably cause trouble.

No matter how charismatic Yang Kai was, he could not erase such deep hatred.

“If they can’t be recruited, then let’s settle this quickly,” Qiu Yimeng sighed deeply, her expression filled with helplessness.

Yang Kai had arrived, and he could now lead Ying Jiu and Xiao Shun to subdue Yang Kang. Given the current defenses around Yang Kang, resisting the attacks of these two Blood Servants would be impossible.

Unexpectedly, Yang Kai gave a sinister smile, a playful curl appearing at the corner of his mouth. “Settle quickly? I’ve just arrived.”

“What do you intend to do?” Young Miss Qiu's expression froze.

“I want to make them despair!” Yang Kai’s face darkened as he glanced at Qiu Yimeng. “Don’t forget, if we don’t make these people utterly despair and fear me, they will still seek other allies to oppose me.”

And those allies would surely be none other than Yang Zhao!

This was an undisputed fact—Yang Zhao and Yang Kang were brothers.

Seeing Yang Kai smile, Qiu Yimeng suddenly felt a chill creeping through her body. A bleak vision of shattered ruins, heaps of corpses, and blood pooling emerged before her eyes.

She never expected Yang Kai’s appetite to be so vast.

Yang Kai’s arrival had naturally not escaped Yang Kang’s notice. At that moment, Yang Kang glared upward like a burning flame, rage contorting his face as he bellowed, “Ninth Brother!”

Yang Kai smiled broadly, greeting warmly, “Fifth Brother, good evening!”

Radiating a rare carefree arrogance, Yang Kang was so enraged he almost coughed up blood, nodding repeatedly, “Well done, Ninth Brother, you’re truly ruthless. Fifth Brother acknowledges your strength!”

Yang Kai’s smile faded slightly, his tone calm: “Xiao Shun, Ying Jiu, follow me.”

Xiao Shun grinned with ferocity while Ying Jiu silently nodded from the shadows.

Casting a casual glance downward, Yang Kai chose a section of the battlefield and charged straight down.

The martial artists on Yang Kang’s side, already thoroughly defeated, faced an even grimmer situation with Yang Kai and his two Blood Servants joining the fray.

These warriors were troubled by Yang Kai’s attacks and harassment. If they fought back, they were swiftly slaughtered by the Blood Servants. If they didn’t, Yang Kai himself was no less formidable—a strike from him could fell even Divine Roaming Realm experts.

Wherever Yang Kai went, it was like a sharp spear piercing through with unstoppable momentum. He moved freely in and out of enemy lines with no resistance.

Exploiting the Yang Family rules about Blood Servants’ participation was tantamount to cheating, leaving their foes helpless — ruthless and unscrupulous.

The battlefield was a scene of utter chaos; cries of pain and despair filled the air.

Yang Kang’s face shifted from anger to dejection. He had no idea what Yang Kai’s true intention was. Despite holding the absolute advantage, he now neglected his command flag, only to see his soldiers beaten and fleeing.

In the chaos, a martial artist suddenly appeared before Yang Kang.

Yang Kang’s weary eyes brightened. “Where is Second Brother?”

Upon learning that the residence was under attack, Yang Kang had sent word for Yang Zhao to bring reinforcements. Now the messenger was belatedly arriving.

The martial artist hurriedly reported, “Fifth Young Master, Second Young Master cannot join the fight.”

“What?” Yang Kang was stunned, biting his teeth and demanding, “Why?”

“The Eldest Young Master has brought some people to harass Second Young Master’s residence, so he cannot spare anyone,” the martial artist explained.

Yang Kang’s expression turned utterly hopeless; he stumbled back a step, murmuring, “How can this be?”

It made no sense that the moment he was attacked, Eldest Brother was simultaneously restraining Second Brother. Was Ninth Brother colluding with Eldest Brother?

“Fifth Young Master, Second Young Master asked me to pass along a message.” The martial artist hesitated, glancing around nervously.

“What message?” Yang Kang’s eyes flickered with the last glimmer of hope.

“Second Young Master says...” The martial artist’s expression was troubled, his voice faltering. “He says, surrender. After all, Ninth Brother will not kill you.”

He paused and added, “These are Second Young Master’s exact words.”

“Surrender?” Yang Kang repeated incredulously, then suddenly burst into uproarious laughter, booming across the battlefield. “Me? Surrender? How could I, Yang Kang, ever surrender?”

His desperate gaze twisted into a fierce, almost maniacal expression, roaring, “Ninth Brother!”

That roar echoed over half the war city. All who heard it involuntarily shuddered—it was a cry not of defeat, but fierce resolve.

Amidst his slaughter in enemy ranks, Yang Kai leapt into the sky, looking down coolly on Yang Kang.

“Ninth Brother, everyone underestimated you, including Fifth Brother. Fifth Brother’s defeat was not undeserved. But if you want to defeat me, do it head-on! Dare you?” Yang Kang’s eyes blazed like wildfires. There was no despair in him; if anyone was the victor, it was him.

“Very well.” Yang Kai smiled lightly, accepting Yang Kang’s challenge before adding, “But I have one condition.”

“Speak.” Yang Kang took a deep breath, his mood calming.

“After tonight, all surviving martial artists in your residence must leave War City immediately!”

Yang Kang was momentarily taken aback, then sneered, “You fear they’ll join Second Brother?”

“Isn’t that what you think?” Yang Kai’s expression did not change.

He was not afraid! Possessing overwhelming advantage, he could wipe them all out if he wished. Yang Kang believed that if he refused this request, Yang Kai might do exactly that.

Kill the snake but allow the stick to remain, and the tiger let loose would still cause trouble.

Knowing full well that sparing these people meant they could oppose him later, no one would hesitate to show no mercy.

Yang Kai’s condition showed he was not eager to be too ruthless.

“Fine!” Yang Kang nodded, leaping up into the sky with Tang Yuxian.

Since defeat was certain, it would be a grand and resolute one. Hesitation was not the style of the Yang Family.

Tang Yuxian took a half step forward, standing before Yang Kang. Her graceful figure without a hint of bone was radiant but marked by a bitter smile as she gazed at Yang Kai. “Young Master, this day has finally come.”

If not for the mishaps involving Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu, Tang Yuxian and Tu Feng would now be following Yang Kai, witnessing victory after victory with smiles.

Yet fate played its tricks. No matter how unwilling, Tang Yuxian had no choice but to oppose Yang Kai.

“Yuxian, no need for your intervention this time. This is between Ninth Brother and me,” Yang Kang acknowledged Tang Yuxian’s relationship with Yang Kai, shaking his head slightly.

“Fifth Young Master.” Tang Yuxian smiled, a small dimple appearing at her mouth’s edge. “Blood Servants have their code. Protecting the young masters is why we participate in the succession war. Even if you forbid me, I will still join this battle.”

Yang Kang was touched.

Choosing Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian as his followers, Yang Kang originally merely intended to provoke Yang Kai. Over recent months, he had grown suspicious of their loyalty, especially when opposing Yang Kai, fearing they might blur allegiance.

But now he saw he had overthought. At this crucial moment, Tang Yuxian still upheld her duty as a Blood Servant.

“I will spar with Yuxian!” Ying Jiu suddenly appeared.
