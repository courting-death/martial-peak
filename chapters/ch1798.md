## Chapter 1798 — Full of Mystery

"This Divine Bird…" Xu Wei looked utterly bewildered; he had no idea what the Divine Bird was encountering now, or why it fled like a dog bereft of a home.

"It seemed like a breakthrough was happening." Zi Long said, thoughtful.

It was not that he lacked insight; this matter involved the power of the Heavenly Laws, and even he could not fathom it.

"Look over there!" Zi Donglai cried out as if he had discovered a new continent, pointing in a direction and yelling, "It's that brat — it has to be him! He actually isn't dead!"

Several thousand li away, a dazzling fleeing light flickered; although Zi Donglai could not make out Yang Kai's face from so far off, he was certain it had to be Yang Kai.

After all, at a time like this, in a place like this, who else could it be besides Yang Kai?

"He's not dead — good!" Zi Long's eyes flashed with keen light. "Heaven truly aids me."

He had previously worried that the Divine Bird had killed Yang Kai and that the Everlasting Tree would be taken back; now that he learned Yang Kai was safe, his heart leapt.

As long as the Everlasting Tree remained in Yang Kai's hands, he still had a chance!

Without hesitation he wrapped Zi Donglai in Saint Yuan and sped off toward where Yang Kai had been seen.

Not far behind the three of them, Ni Guang, Ghost Ancestor and the others likewise encountered a Divine Bird returning headlong, and were thrown into a flurry by the Seven Luminaries Divine Light it spewed.

"The Divine Bird is returning to its nest… and Yang Kai…" After steadying herself, Xue Yue's face went white at a possibility she could hardly accept, her body trembling.

Women were not the same as men. Years ago on that Dead Star he had groped her from head to toe; although she had hated him then, he had been the first man to touch her body, and had taken a place of special significance in her heart. Later she had been ravaged by the Profound Yin Moon Water and hovered at death's door; it was Yang Kai's Spiritual Pill that saved her life.

She had tried to draw Yang Kai close, to keep him by her side, but he had refused, leaving Xue Yue heartbroken.

So over the years Xue Yue had held a grudge against Yang Kai… and had never forgotten him.

But she had her pride and her own way of doing things; she would not pester Yang Kai like an ordinary woman, saying shameful things. As the next heir of the Hengluo Commerce Guild, her foremost concern was the prosperity of the Commerce Guild; her own happiness and desires were but mirages.

In the Imperial Garden, when she met Yang Kai again, Xue Yue was overjoyed. She had intended to speak with him properly, but when she saw Yang Kai and the enchantress Shan Qingluo entwined in intimate affection, Xue Yue's blood boiled.

That reunion had not ended in the best way.

The matter had caused Xue Yue long regret and self-reproach, and she secretly resolved that if she ever saw Yang Kai again she would set things straight with him.

Yet she also knew the Star Domain was vast, and for two people without contact to meet again was nearly impossible.

What surprised her most was that a second reunion truly came.

Outside the entrance to the Lost Realm, Xue Yue saw Yang Kai rushing up and could hardly believe her eyes.

She was not some easily beguiled girl and had always scoffed at fate. But this time she found herself believing.

In the Lost Realm, at the brink of life and death, Xue Yue finally cast everything aside and, using a near shameless and forceful approach, compelled Yang Kai to speak his mind—thus fulfilling her long-cherished wish.

As she had said, her demand was not high; as long as there existed a man in this world who would treat her as a woman, make her feel all the things a woman ought to feel, she would be satisfied.

But now… that man might already be dead!

Xue Yue could hardly accept it; she stood stunned as if struck by lightning, her fair face drained of color.

"That boy Yang isn't dead!" Ghost Ancestor's gaze was deep as he stared forward. "Zi Long chased out — he must have found Yang Kai's trail. We should pursue as well; move quickly. With Yang Kai's strength he cannot withstand Zi Long. If Zi Long gets to him first, the matter will be irreversible!"

Hearing this, Xue Yue trembled and looked at Ni Guang, her voice quivering: "Uncle Ni!"

Ni Guang said nothing; Saint Yuan enveloped Xue Yue as he advanced alongside Ghost Ancestor.

After flying for a while, Ni Guang finally spoke: "Third Young Master, Yang Kai might be a fine friend, but don't think too highly of him; you must remember what mission you shoulder."

He had clearly perceived a problem: whether it was Xue Yue's earlier conduct in the Lost Realm or her present urgency, it made him aware of Yang Kai's weight in her heart.

Xue Yue's face frozen; she nodded imperceptibly. "I know, Uncle Ni."

Ghost Ancestor gave a strange laugh. "Love between men and women is natural; what does it have to do with the mission she bears? Heh heh heh — your Hengluo Commerce Guild's people do act rather prudishly."

Ni Guang's expression changed sharply; he turned to look at Ghost Ancestor in astonishment.

"What are you staring at? I know this little girl is female; I'm sure you knew as well," Ghost Ancestor snorted coldly. "Stop playing coy."

The Hengluo Commerce Guild entrusted Ni Guang with taking Xue Yue out to gain experience because he was trustworthy, and Ni Guang's cultivation at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm certainly qualified him to access the guild's top secrets.

So Ghost Ancestor was unafraid to speak plainly.

In fact, as Ghost Ancestor guessed, few in the Hengluo Commerce Guild knew Xue Yue was female, and among those few was Ni Guang.

Ni Guang had been a lifesworn friend of Chairman Ai Ou since youth and had contributed greatly to the Guild's development; within the Commerce Guild his status was second only to Ai Ou and a few Grand Elders who minded their own affairs.

"How did you know such a thing?" Ni Guang exclaimed.

"What's so strange?" Ghost Ancestor sneered. "Not only do I know she's female, I see that her constitution is unusual. Though I don't know precisely what it is, I suspect it ties to why you hid her true sex. Let me guess — a constitution that needs sex hidden to conceal it: besides the rumored Miao Lu Divine Body, there's the Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body. She doesn't look overly seductive, so it's probably not the Miao Lu Divine Body; dressed as a man she looks heroic, so perhaps it is the Dragon Marrow Phoenix Body? Tsk… such constitutions are found once in ten thousand years."

Ni Guang was truly aghast; his gaze darkened as he glared at Ghost Ancestor, never expecting the old fellow's insight and breadth of knowledge to deduce Xue Yue's true constitution from mere conjecture.

Xue Yue was also greatly shocked and looked at Ghost Ancestor in astonishment.

She believed Ghost Ancestor had not learned this from Yang Kai; Yang Kai would not be so bored as to tell him.

"You…" Ni Guang opened his mouth.

"Rest easy!" Ghost Ancestor said with a smile, reaching out a hand and patting Ni Guang on the shoulder with great familiarity.

Ni Guang had been wary, but sensing no malice in Ghost Ancestor, he did not react strongly and allowed the gesture.

"I wouldn't do anything to the girl; after all she's the Sect Master's woman. Heh heh heh… that makes us family. The Sect Master is fortunate — if the two of them one day harmonize yin and yang, his strength may well increase." Ghost Ancestor chuckled oddly.

"Senior!" Xue Yue blushed deeply and glared at Ghost Ancestor for his loose tongue and lack of respect.

Ni Guang felt dazed and thoroughly disarmed by Ghost Ancestor's antics; he could only turn his gaze to Xue Yue.

Xue Yue kept her head lowered and dared not speak.

“Sigh!” Ni Guang let out a deep sigh. “Yue’er, don’t let your father know about this just yet. I’m afraid he’ll be furious. I’ve watched you grow up since you were a child, and with no children of my own, I’ve always seen you as a daughter. I’ll find a chance to talk to your father about this and see what he thinks.”

"Thank you, Uncle Ni," Xue Yue whispered, biting her lip.

"Don't thank me yet; you know your father's temper — this is… difficult." Ni Guang sighed and suddenly glared at Ghost Ancestor. "You old bastard, you have no shame saying such things in front of a junior."

"Heh heh!" Ghost Ancestor laughed oddly and showed no remorse.

"However…" Ni Guang's expression turned grave as he stared at Ghost Ancestor. "You just called that boy the Sect Master — does that mean you belong to the same Sect as him? What Sect are you from? Why have I never heard of you?"

Ni Guang reasoned that with Ghost Ancestor's formidable realm, his Sect should be renowned, not obscure.

Yet he had never heard of Ghost Ancestor before, nor seen him.

"I did join the same Sect as Yang Kai, but… only in the Lost Realm did I decide to join; I haven't even seen what the Sect is like yet," Ghost Ancestor replied.

Ni Guang looked at Ghost Ancestor as if he were a fool and exclaimed, "Only just decided to join? What does that Sect have to attract someone of your caliber?"

If a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert could be drawn in, the Sect must possess something compelling, otherwise why would such a figure join? Ni Guang was curious what Yang Kai's Sect had to offer to attract Ghost Ancestor.

“Heh heh!” Ghost Ancestor chuckled without saying a word, his expression full of mystery.

Hmph — if he were to tell them that the Sect had three Void King-Grade Alchemists, they would be terrified; he was not one to boast lightly.

"Enough, enough." Ni Guang waved his hand, a little dispirited. "If you sit guard there, that boy's Sect can't be too shabby, and from what I see the boy's talent and character are not bad; Yue'er's eye for men is not poor, so he has some qualification to match her."

Xue Yue smiled sweetly; hearing Ni Guang praise Yang Kai seemed to please her more than praise directed at herself.

Ni Guang saw her expression and sighed inwardly; even someone as wise as Yue'er behaved like an ordinary woman when it came to this matter.
