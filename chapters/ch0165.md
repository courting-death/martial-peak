## Chapter 165 — Outing

On that day, Shopkeeper Meng held the Sect Leader's jade pendant and issued a decree to the Elder Council, promoting Yang Kai to the status of Outer Disciple. Wei Xitong, however, had to meddle in the matter, intending to test the waters. Yet, things did not unfold as he had anticipated. Yang Kai's refusal directly turned the tables on him, catching him completely off guard.

Upon recalling this, Su Xuanwu felt a surge of delight.

"Second Elder, should we not intervene? Yang Kai's refusal will surely lead to trouble," a disciple inquired again.

"No!" Su Xuanwu slowly shook his head. "There is no need to concern ourselves with this matter; we can simply watch the show."

"Understood!" The disciple, though confused, dared not refute.

"Wei Xitong, how will you explain this to the Sect Leader?"

With a confident expression, Su Xuanwu placed a white piece on the board.

The previously lifeless endgame suddenly showed signs of revival, as the besieged white pieces seemed to rise like a dragon, subtly on the verge of breaking free.

Yang Kai, of course, was unaware that his unintentional actions would involve so many intricacies. At this moment, he sat cross-legged at the cave entrance, his mind tranquil.

A day later, Yang Kai stood up, calling out to the Earth Demon.

In a moment, a wisp of black gas flew out from the Dragon Confinement Ravine, coiling around Yang Kai's fingers before vanishing.

"Did you find anything down there?" Yang Kai asked.

"I did not dare to venture too deep, only absorbing some evil energy from a thousand zhang below. There were no significant discoveries. However, rest assured, once I recover more strength, I will be able to delve deeper," the Earth Demon’s voice came through.

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded, crouching down to touch a Yin-Yang Demon Ginseng, giving it a drop of Yang Liquid. He instructed, "You should absorb Yang Qi here. Remember, if those two women who have been here before do not come, you must flee, understood?"

The ginseng's facial features displayed a hint of understanding.

"Are you going far, Young Master?" the Earth Demon asked.

"Yes, just going out for a stroll. You can come with me."

"Naturally," the Earth Demon replied, a hint of excitement in its tone. "Young Master, if you encounter anyone you can kill during this trip, do not let them go. My Soul-Breaking Spike has lost its spirit and needs a human soul to repair it. The more souls I absorb, the stronger its power will be. If I can fully restore it, heh, with this treasure in your hands, you could dominate a region and command the world!"

Yang Kai smiled faintly, clearly not swayed by the Earth Demon’s words.

His desire to go out was also driven by his own considerations.

Firstly, having just rejected the promotion order, staying behind would likely lead to complications.

Secondly, he was also thinking of Su Yan. The Dual Cultivation Technique made it difficult for her to control her thoughts. If he remained here, once her emotions surged, it would be hard to manage. The Ice Heart Technique she practiced was destined to keep her heart steady; by leaving, he was effectively helping her burn her boats, forcing her to resist with all her might, which would greatly benefit her cultivation.

The third point was based on his own considerations; cultivation in the Qi Movement Realm could not be achieved merely through meditation. Only by experiencing life-and-death trials could one grow rapidly.

Recalling the gap in strength between himself and Su Yan, Yang Kai felt he could no longer remain within the sect, living a relatively comfortable life.

Leaving a letter in the cave, Yang Kai set off lightly, departing Lingxiao Pavilion under the cover of night.

Unbeknownst to Yang Kai, a green figure stood silently atop a tree branch, neither calling out to stop him nor stepping forward to bid farewell, simply watching him quietly.

The night breeze blew, stirring the thin veil, revealing a beauty that could topple nations.

After a long while, a somewhat aged voice sounded from behind her: "Disciple, it is late and the dew is heavy. You should rest early."

The tone was filled with helplessness and affection.

"Mm." Xia Ningshang hugged her arms tightly, feeling a bit cold.

Having left Lingxiao Pavilion, Yang Kai did not have a specific destination in mind; he merely chose a random direction. Flames erupted beneath his feet as he sped away like the wind.

In a single night, he traveled two to three hundred li away from Lingxiao Pavilion.

The night’s swift journey immersed Yang Kai in a state of enlightenment.

He contemplated the changes in his Primordial Qi within his legs, sensing an inexplicable rhythm whenever his speed increased, eager to find a reasonable pattern within.

From the Jiuyin Valley, Yang Kai had roughly understood how to use Primordial Qi to enhance his speed. After several experiments in the Inheritance Celestial Cave, the results were quite satisfactory.

However, this was merely a rough application of Primordial Qi, lacking a fixed routine.

In battle, while powerful martial techniques were undoubtedly important, possessing exquisite footwork could also provide a significant advantage, making it easier to handle an opponent's attacks.

This point was something Yang Kai deeply understood from his experience defeating Long Hui, who had relied on a set of footwork to toy with him for quite some time.

Footwork was precisely what Yang Kai lacked the most at this moment.

Yang Kai was self-aware; he was merely a small martial artist in the Qi Movement Realm and could not possibly create overly intricate footwork.

Yet, he could find the most reasonable and effective way to utilize Primordial Qi through his own walking and running, pondering how to enhance his speed and maximize the effects of even the smallest amounts of Primordial Qi.

The insights gained in this manner might not be very sophisticated and could be of no use to others, but they would undoubtedly be the most suitable for him.

Powerful martial techniques were created by those with profound strength through endless enlightenment, representing a distillation of their own power and thoughts.

In his contemplation, Yang Kai's movements appeared strange and bizarre, his face a mask of confusion, as if he had lost his soul, yet his feet never ceased moving.

At times, he would dash east for dozens of li, then turn south, walking slowly for several li, then west, or even north. He crossed mountains and rivers, his speed fluctuating, his direction unpredictable.

Occasionally, he would crash into a large tree or tumble into a water pit, leaving him in a disheveled state, clothes tattered, yet Yang Kai paid no mind to it.

Only when his strength was exhausted would he temporarily stop to find some wild game to fill his belly, and after recovering, he would continue this aimless journey.

The Earth Demon watched in secret, astonished. With its knowledge and experience, it naturally understood what Yang Kai was doing. It was precisely because of this understanding that it was so shocked.

A mere Qi Movement Realm martial artist could become immersed in such profound enlightenment, as if merging with the heavens and earth, body and mind in unison; this completely overturned the Earth Demon’s understanding.

Though impressed, the Earth Demon was also somewhat dismissive.

After all, Yang Kai's strength was too low; even if he was in a state of enlightenment and creation, he could not attain anything too profound.

In the Earth Demon’s view, with this time wasted running around, it would be better to find a place to refine some treasure capable of carrying a person through the air. With the aid of such a treasure, why bother using one’s feet to travel?

However, considering Yang Kai's personality, the Earth Demon did not dare to voice its thoughts, knowing that the methods for refining treasures it was aware of were exceedingly evil, requiring the melting of human bodies and bones, and the sealing of souls. If it were to speak of this, Yang Kai would surely scorn it.

After rushing for over ten days, Yang Kai remained immersed in his enlightenment, unaware of how many li he had traveled. While he had made no progress in his understanding of footwork, he had gained some insights into controlling his Primordial Qi.

Truly, it was an unintentional gain.

In the past, whenever Yang Kai's speed surged, flames would erupt beneath his feet, but now, the flames were no longer visible, and he could hardly sense any fluctuations of Primordial Qi. As he walked and ran, there were no traces to be found, moving smoothly and naturally.

Moreover, the traces of his Primordial Qi's turbulence gradually calmed down, no longer as obvious as when he had just advanced; now, a single movement of Primordial Qi could no longer be easily discerned.

As more days passed, while Yang Kai was running, he suddenly slowed his pace, walking leisurely as if in a garden. After a moment, his figure flickered, and when he reappeared, he was already over ten zhang away.

Before he could stabilize his form, he flickered again, and when this figure dissipated, Yang Kai returned to his original position, as if he had never moved at all, his leisurely pace continuing forward.

After a moment, this strange occurrence happened again, but this time Yang Kai's figure flickered one more time than before.

Day after day of experimentation in enlightenment, one day, Yang Kai's figure flickered seven times, and when he finally settled, he was already a hundred zhang away.

His complexion slightly flushed, he took a deep breath, and a smile appeared at the corner of Yang Kai's mouth.

The Earth Demon’s voice timely rang out: "Congratulations, Young Master, for forging your own footwork! Young Master’s might is admirable; this old servant bows to you!"

"Stop flattering me." Yang Kai chuckled lightly. "What do you think of this footwork?"

The Earth Demon pondered for a moment before speaking: "Does Young Master wish to hear the truth or a falsehood?"

"First, let me hear the falsehood."

The Earth Demon’s voice immediately rang out: "This footwork is unparalleled in the world, unlike anything found in the mortal realm. In its movements, there are no traces to be found, like an antelope's horns. This old servant is ashamed; I have never seen such exquisite footwork in my life, and truly do not know how to comment."

Yang Kai laughed heartily: "You’re being too insincere. Speak the truth."

"Hehe." The Earth Demon straightened its expression and said seriously: "Young Master, creating such footwork at the Qi Movement Realm truly leaves this old servant in awe. However, this footwork has not yet reached perfection. What Young Master currently perceives is too rough. If used against opponents of the same level, it should pose no major issues, but if faced with an opponent stronger than you, it may be somewhat difficult to execute. Furthermore, I observe that Young Master can only flicker seven times with this footwork before becoming exhausted; this is likely your limit."

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded, acknowledging the Earth Demon’s words.

His current strength was still too low to grasp anything too profound. Being able to create a set of footwork that belonged to him was already quite satisfying. Once his strength increased in the future, he could refine and improve upon it.

Moreover, his gains were not limited to just this set of footwork; he also learned how to conceal his Primordial Qi fluctuations during his travels. When not engaging in combat, Yang Kai now appeared no different from an ordinary person. Even when he did engage, he would no longer be as frenzied as before, unless he resorted to the Unyielding Will.
