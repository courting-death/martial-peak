## Chapter 1258 — Blood Sword Grass Seed

Hearing Yang Kai ask that, Yang Yan was taken aback; she quickly covered her small mouth and laughed so hard her figure trembled, bending forward and then backward.

"What are you laughing at?" Yang Kai asked, annoyed.

Yang Yan kept waving her hands but couldn't stop laughing; tears welled at the corners of her eyes.

Yang Kai rolled his eyes and asked, "So you're skilled in beautifying arts — not actually as young as you appear, but a woman who has lived for thousands of years?"

Yang Yan, as if her tail had been stepped on, abruptly stopped laughing; her pretty eyes glared viciously at Yang Kai and she ground her teeth, "I can answer that — I am absolutely not a woman who has lived for thousands of years!"

"I figured…" Yang Kai nodded lightly. If Yang Yan had truly lived for thousands of years, her experience would not be so lacking; from all his past interactions with her, she didn't seem to have lived that long.

Yang Yan's expression turned solemn and, for a moment, a look of dread flashed across her face before she finally spoke, "You mean to ask whether I usurped this body, don't you?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded calmly; only by being usurped could it explain why Yang Yan was relatively young yet mastered both the arts of refining and arrays.

One person's energy is limited. Although Yang Kai's skill in alchemy was not shallow, he knew he couldn't possibly have the energy to research many other fields unless he abandoned his own cultivation path.

Yet Yang Yan possessed tremendous achievements in both refining and array arts; the Secret Treasures she forged and the arrays she set up, in finesse and practicality, far exceeded the overall standard of Dark Star. How had she done that?

The world is not short of geniuses, but even if Yang Yan were a prodigy, her years alone could not account for such heights — which is why Yang Kai asked.

"Have you suspected for a long time?" Yang Yan asked, looking at Yang Kai.

"Ever since I learned you were a master of arrays, I thought about it. But rest assured, whether you were usurped or not is none of my business — I know the soul in this body. The previous soul, I don't care about." Yang Kai said indifferently.

Yang Yan let out a bitter smile and, after a moment of silence, spoke softly: “You’re not the only one who’s had such doubts. Even I sometimes can’t make sense of it… But I don’t think I’ve been possessed. From my childhood memories up to everything I’ve experienced now — they’re all perfectly intact in my mind. And there’s no trace of another person’s thoughts within me. If I had been possessed, that would be impossible.”

"Then under which great master's tutelage did you study, such that you mastered refining and arrays?" Yang Kai asked, surprised; he had no doubt about her words.

Yang Yan slowly shook her head, lightly bit her lip, her small hands nervously twisting her black robe; after a long hesitation she suddenly raised her chin and said in a low voice, "If I told you I was born knowing how to refine and lay arrays, would you believe me?"

"How could that be possible?" Yang Kai looked stunned.

Yang Yan smiled bitterly, "But it's the truth. I really seemed to be born with this knowledge. The refining arts and arrays feel as if sealed within my mind; as I continuously craft Secret Treasures and set arrays, that knowledge slowly unseals, allowing me to understand more and more profound refining and array principles. Sometimes I see rare things I've never encountered before, yet I can recognize them and know their functions — isn't that strange?"

Yang Kai listened, dumbfounded.

This was more than strange; it was utterly baffling. No one is born inexplicably proficient in refining and arrays — there must be a reason, and that reason might be something even Yang Yan herself couldn't fathom.

Perhaps for that reason, Yang Yan sometimes felt a creeping terror herself.

There was no reason for Yang Yan to lie to him — and she wasn’t the sort who would lie.

Yang Kai couldn't help with this matter. He had long known Yang Yan was odd, but he hadn't expected it to be this extreme. He didn't press the issue further; for Yang Kai, whether Yang Yan had been usurped or born with those talents was irrelevant — he only knew the Yang Yan before him.

After musing for a moment, Yang Kai asked, "What Secret Treasures can you refine now?"

"Origin-Grade Upper-Level should be no problem; given ample materials to practice on, sooner or later I could refine Void King-Grade Secret Treasures." Mentioning her field restored much of Yang Yan's spirit; she held her chin high, pride evident in her expression.

"Very well, help me refine this further." Yang Kai said awkwardly as he produced the purple shield.

The shield that once had rippling purple aura now lay dull and dark, its spirit much diminished.

Yang Yan's face showed concern at once; she picked up the shield and gently stroked it, asking, "Did it strike some fire-attribute seal? For a single blow to reduce an Origin-Grade Middle-Level defensive Secret Treasure to this…"

"Yes, but at least the danger was averted." Yang Kai grinned.

"I understand. With the materials you gave, refining it into an Origin-Grade Upper-Level Secret Treasure should be fine." Yang Yan's Spatial Ring flashed with a glow as she tucked the Purple Shield inside; she smoothed her hair and recovered her usual composure, her eyes bright with pleasure. "What else did you get on this trip? Bring it out and let me see."

"Wait a moment!" Yang Kai nodded and began searching his Spatial Ring. He'd obtained many good things this trip and had invited Yang Yan over precisely so she could inspect them; there were items even he didn't understand.

Soon Yang Kai waved his hand and a millstone-sized, flaming-red crystal suffused with scorching Spiritual Qi appeared before them.

Yang Yan's pupils instantly lit with a different kind of light; she was drawn to that fire-red crystal and kept staring, one hand still gently caressing it.

"It should be a Crystal Stone!" Yang Kai stroked his chin. "I just don't understand why it's so huge, and it's odd how I acquired it — it wasn't taken from a Fire Spirit Beast's body…"

Yang Kai briefly recounted his experience in that strange valley, and that enormous Crystal Stone was his first gain upon entering the Flowing Flame Sandland.

While Yang Kai spoke, Yang Yan stared at the Crystal Stone without speaking, lightly running her fingers over it.

When Yang Kai finished, Yang Yan nodded, "It should indeed be a Crystal Stone, but this one has a self-contained array inside, which is why it can emit fire Spiritual Qi and form various Fire Spirit Beasts to impede your progress."

"A self-contained array inside?" Yang Kai's expression changed — he had not noticed that.

"Yes, innate and a very profound array." Yang Yan pursed her lips and smiled. "This thing has some uses, but using it to refine artifacts is a bit of a plunder; give it to me — it can be used as a Formation Core for an array I intend to set up."

"Fine." Yang Kai nodded and, not stingy at all, cheerfully gave it to her. After all, Yang Yan setting an array would help guard Dragon Lair Mountain and benefit him as well.

Yang Yan put the huge Crystal Stone into her Spatial Ring and looked at Yang Kai expectantly.

"And this!" Yang Kai reached in and produced a blood-red object that looked like a grass seed but exuded a strange, bloody aura.

"A seed of the Blood Sword Grass!" The moment Yang Yan saw it, her face drained of color and she cried out in alarm.

She had recognized the seed instantly.

"Blood Sword Grass… the name suits it," Yang Kai murmured, recalling his experience when trapped in that strange maze — when he broke the array's confinement and walked along a passage out, numerous red weeds on both sides sprang to life and ganged up on him with attacks.

Those blood-red weeds were, indeed, exceptionally hard and sharp; even Yang Kai's tough flesh dared not let them cut at will.

"The Flowing Flame Sandland actually has such things," Yang Yan said, her face paling.

"Is it famous?" Yang Kai asked, puzzled by the way she treated it like a dire enemy.

"I don't know about fame, but I know how terrifying it is. It can grow without limit; as long as it has enough flesh to consume, its power grows continuously. If it reaches full maturity, even a body of the Void King Realm can be sliced by it."

"That terrifying?" Yang Kai was startled, instantly feeling both trepidation and relief.

If what Yang Yan said was true, the Blood Sword Grass he'd encountered hadn't matured, otherwise it wouldn't have been helpless against him.

"This thing was notorious in ancient times; many great Sects and forbidden places planted some as guardians," Yang Yan said, carefully pinching the blood-red seed between her fingers.

"What a pity there's only one seed; if there were more…" Yang Kai said, not with fear but with regret.

"Pity?" Yang Yan sneered. "Not in the least — one seed is enough. Blood Sword Grass can reproduce on its own; with a single seed and sufficient flesh, it can propagate into an entire patch."

Yang Kai's eyes brightened at that.

"What do you intend to do?" Yang Yan seemed to sense a dangerous glint in Yang Kai's eyes, her heart fluttering as she hurriedly asked.

"Nothing bad." Yang Kai chuckled as he took the Blood Sword Grass seed back from Yang Yan and carefully stowed it away.

"I'll tell you this: if you want to plant it, tell me beforehand. But don't worry too much — as long as you don't give it flesh to feed on, it won't grow and isn't particularly harmful."

"All right, I understand." Yang Kai nodded, then withdrew two more items from his Spatial Ring.
