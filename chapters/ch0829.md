## Chapter 829 — The First Appearance of the Golden Dragon's Head

Two months passed in the blink of an eye; Yang Kai had been spending that time cultivating and growing familiar with the method of tearing space.

He spent the better part of those days within rent voids, quietly sensing the chaotic streams of the void and searching for the hidden secrets within.

When his Divine Sense was exhausted, he would sit and recover; once his True Yuan and spirit were replenished, he would resume, repeating the cycle with relish.

By now he could easily tear space and, through the void, arrive at other places in the world.

Yet even when he exerted his all, the distance was still somewhat short—barely enough to shift three or four hundred Li in an instant. Moreover, he couldn't control the direction; returning from the void he could only appear somewhere at random.

Every time he used the technique, Yang Kai was exceedingly cautious.

Within the void's chaotic currents there could be no carelessness; that disorderly energy was peculiarly dangerous and hard to guard against. Several times Yang Kai had nearly been swept away—if he hadn't fled quickly, he might never have escaped.

His strong, tenacious body proved crucial; as when facing the starry sky, those void currents were highly harmful to the physical form. Yang Kai estimated that even Wu Jie would need to employ a Secret Treasure to protect his body when using it.

One day Yang Kai returned from the void and appeared in a grey, misty valley.

He could not determine exactly where he had arrived, so every return kept him wary, lest he fall into some dangerous place.

This time was no different: the moment he appeared, Yang Kai reined in his aura and silently spread his Divine Sense to sweep the surroundings.

After a moment, surprise crossed Yang Kai's face.

He discovered that at the mouth of the valley there were at least a hundred people gathered, led by a First Stage of the Saint Realm expert, and among the rest all levels of strength were represented.

All stood solemnly at the entrance, as if engaged in something unknown.

Yang Kai immediately realized he had likely wandered into some faction's territory by accident. But since only one First Stage Saint Realm expert stood there, he felt no great worry.

He sought a nearby hidden spot, sat cross‑legged, concealed his figure, and began restoring his depleted strength.

Yang Kai had no intent to pry into other factions' affairs; yet after half a day's recovery he noticed that the group at the mouth of the valley seemed to be conducting some sacred rite—each person solemn, and the weaker cultivators visibly excited and expectant.

Curiosity rose in Yang Kai, so he did not hurry off but remained to watch.

After a full half day the ritual concluded. Under a series of stirring proclamations, the Saint Realm expert intoned words Yang Kai could not understand, their meaning deep and unfathomable.

After a short while, a cultivator roughly at the peak of the True Yuan Realm strode into the valley.

A True Yuan Realm peak cultivator in Zhongdu might not be considered weak, but on the Tongxuan Continent such strength usually marked either mediocre talent or youth.

This newcomer belonged to the latter.

In the grey mist he walked straight past where Yang Kai hid; Yang Kai could see he was only fourteen or fifteen years old.

Like his younger self years ago, his immature face bore stubbornness and a hunger for strength; he strode forward with excitement.

Yang Kai let out a wry laugh.

He stayed put, his Divine Sense fixed on the youth—he wanted to see what the boy was about to do.

The valley was not very wide but wound deep and secret; the youth walked steadily, eyes unerring.

Yet before he had gone a hundred zhang, a gentle pushing force suddenly appeared from deeper within the valley and struck him head‑on.

The boy could not resist; the force shoved him stumbling backward.

Once he steadied himself, his face fell in dejection.

Yang Kai frowned, for when that pushing force appeared he suddenly felt a prickling behind his back, as if something crawled along him.

When he probed carefully there was nothing on his back at all.

He slowly shook his head, bewilderment showing on his face.

After being pushed back, the youth hung his head and retreated; shortly after he left the valley and the crowd at the entrance, seeing his demeanor, immediately understood.

The First Stage Saint Realm expert seated there didn't so much as glance at him and barked, "Next!"

Another boy of similar age stepped forward into the valley.

The same fate befell him: after advancing only a short distance, he was pushed back by that gentle force and left dejected.

One after another, youths entered and were forced to return in helpless succession.

Even the Saint Realm expert presiding there appeared somewhat dispirited.

After observing long enough, Yang Kai finally gleaned the point—though he didn't know precisely what rite this was, it appeared to be a test.

Regrettably, none of the young entrants passed; they were all stopped dozens to hundreds of zhang from the goal.

Hundreds of youths entered, and the number of those who failed dwindled; each of the failed lads sighed, disappointment plain on their faces.

Yang Kai covertly cast his gaze further into the valley, his expression grave.

Each time that gentle force pushed an entrant back, he would feel that prickling on his back. At first Yang Kai thought it was an illusion or some hidden cultivator playing a trick.

But after many repetitions and careful observation he found the truth was different.

The tingling on his back, the feeling of something crawling, were clearly caused by the golden‑dragon pattern on his back flowing.

If he listened closely, Yang Kai could even hear a faint, veiled dragon roar.

The golden‑dragon pattern on his back and Su Yan's ice‑phoenix pattern on hers were imprinted because they inherited the Dual Cultivation Technique.

What did that have to do with this place?

Thinking it over, Yang Kai stepped out from his hiding place and walked toward the interior of the valley.

He spread his Divine Sense, and not long after his face turned astonished.

Though he had been watching the crowd at the mouth, he had not examined the valley's terrain closely until now; looking down from above, the winding valley resembled a massive dragon lying curled here.

The mouth was the dragon's tail; the deep interior formed the dragon's head; several side paths formed claw‑like branches—uncannily vivid.

Moreover, the deeper he went the clearer the tingling on his back became and the faster the golden‑dragon pattern seemed to swim.

Yang Kai became increasingly convinced that the inheritance he and Su Yan received was related to this place.

How uncanny, Yang Kai frowned—he had merely been testing the space‑tearing method and accidentally arrived here.

If so, he could vaguely guess which faction this place belonged to.

At the mouth the Saint Realm expert's brow tightened into a line as he weakly shouted, "Next!"

A handsome‑featured youth stepped forward and entered the valley.

After he vanished into the mist, the Saint Realm cultivator at the mouth breathed a small sigh.

"Master of the Manor, this is the last one," a Transcendent Realm cultivator nearby said.

The man called the Master of the Manor nodded faintly: "I know, this time there is likely no hope either."

The Transcendent Realm cultivator frowned: "Three years of searching for a hundred youths, and after so many years there is no change—Master of the Manor, are we doing something wrong?"

The Master of the Manor glanced at him: "What are you doubting?"

"I wouldn't dare, but..."

"No buts!" the Master barked. "Although we're not powerful now, remember that long ago we were one of the most powerful forces in the world. Everyone treated us with courtesy; our disciples walked the continent untouched, and no one dared provoke us!"

"Yes."

The Master's expression sank as he sighed: "Our ancestors recorded those days in the annals to remind us not to forget their glory! Yet so many years no one has passed the Dragon Valley's test, and the sect's past splendor cannot be revived!"

"Master, in your day..." the Transcendent Realm cultivator asked curiously.

The Master shook his head sadly: "I didn't either. Fortunately I advanced to the Saint Realm, otherwise this estate might not have been preserved."

A group of naive youths listened to their talk, curiosity bright in their eyes.

At that moment the perennial grey mist that shrouded the valley grew chaotic; the whole Dragon Valley quaked, and everyone at the mouth turned pale, unsure what calamity had occurred.

The youths panicked, faces drained of color.

A loud, resounding dragon roar suddenly echoed from the depths of the valley, and a golden radiance surged upward like a brilliant sun, blinding in its brilliance.

The Master's eyes widened, and the Transcendent Realm cultivator beside him mirrored his shock and fear.

The golden light twisted and coalesced, and moments later formed a majestic dragon head, cold and proud as it gazed down.

Under its stare, everyone felt small and diminished.

Even the Master trembled; pointing at the golden head he quivered and cried, "It appears, it appears...just as the annals record — the Golden Dragon's Head manifests, the Dragon Emperor returns..."

"Master...could this mean...someone passed the test?" the Transcendent Realm cultivator asked, stunned.

The Master, overcome with emotion, wept. For a long while he stared at the golden head before finally asking, "The lad who just entered—what's his name and where is he from?"
