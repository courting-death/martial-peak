## Chapter 1846 — This Lord Is Very Satisfied

The next morning, at dawn.

Hua Youmeng arrived outside the room as promised, holding a tray with several clusters of spirit fruit.

The fruit was clearly no ordinary produce; it emitted a rich Spiritual Qi and a fragrant scent, plainly a treasure that would greatly benefit a martial artist who consumed it.

She hesitated at the door, unsure what to say, when the door opened of its own accord and Yang Kai was seated cross-legged inside, smiling faintly at her.

"Greetings, my Lord." Hua Youmeng immediately composed herself and offered a graceful bow.

"Chairwoman Hua, you are too polite, please come in." Yang Kai gestured with his hand.

"Excuse the intrusion." Hua Youmeng said as she stepped in, placed the tray down, and continued, "The place is humble; I prepared a few things to stave off hunger—please do not disdain them, Lord."

"Jadeblood Exquisite Fruit?" Yang Kai glanced at the cluster of fruits that looked like amethyst grapes and, slightly surprised, nodded, "Chairwoman Hua, you went to the trouble."

"As long as you like them, Lord." Hua Youmeng said carefully, standing at one side with a look of restraint and unease.

After all, even now she did not understand the fellow’s background or identity, nor why someone as influential as Lu Tianfeng feared him so much; what happened yesterday, in any other Commerce Guild, would likely have meant the annihilation of the entire family, but here not only were the Five-Party Commerce Guilds left unscathed, they even received large compensations and Lu Tianfeng personally apologized.

Such a thing was not the work of an ordinary force—this young man’s backing must be unimaginably great; Hua Youmeng dared not be careless.

What troubled Hua Youmeng most was that she did not even know his name.

"Chairwoman Hua, please sit. No need for such formality." Yang Kai smiled at her.

“In your presence, my Lord, I wouldn’t dare be presumptuous.” Hua Youmeng pressed her red lips together, forcing a faint, uneasy smile as she remained standing where she was.

Yang Kai rubbed his forehead, thought for a moment, and then said solemnly, "Chairwoman Hua, are you blaming me?"

Hua Youmeng’s pretty face changed; she hastily waved her hand, "Why would the Lord say that? If not for your pulling the situation back from the brink yesterday, the Commerce Guild would have surely been destroyed and our brothers and sisters would not have escaped death. I am full of gratitude for the life-saving grace of the Lord. How could I blame you?"

"Heh heh, I hid my strength and my identity, and came to you for no reason, bringing you this disaster. Surely Chairwoman Hua must have some grievances?"

Hua Youmeng’s brows slightly knit; it seemed Yang Kai had struck at her exact worry, leaving her momentarily speechless.

"Not only Chairwoman Hua, those few friends may well hold opinions of me too, just not daring to show them," Yang Kai chuckled.

Hua Youmeng forced a smile, "You are perceptive, Lord. There is an old saying: when immortals fight, mortals suffer. The Commerce Guild and I are but a small force beneath this sky; any ripple could shatter us beyond recovery."

As she spoke, she seemed to muster some courage and spoke clearly, "We are indeed grateful for what you did yesterday, but such an ordeal we never wish to undergo again. I am inexperienced and could not imagine what about our Commerce Guild would attract you to linger here; with your status and strength, you could go anywhere in Purple Star City, could you not?"

"Indeed." Yang Kai nodded. "But if I had left yesterday, you would have surely suffered, so I chose to remain. You helped me at the city gate entrance, Chairwoman Hua; I could not simply walk away and leave matters unfinished."

Hua Youmeng was taken aback and slightly inclined her head.

Yang Kai laughed, "Let me introduce myself properly. My name is Yang Kai. Concealing my strength was merely a matter of convenience; after all, I can’t go around shouting everywhere I go that I’m a Void King Realm cultivator, can I? That’d be far too ostentatious. As for my identity… I’d rather not speak of it. I hope President Hua can understand.”

Hua Youmeng said, "The Lord must have unavoidable reasons."

"You could say that. But you needn’t worry—think of me as an ordinary Void King Realm cultivator..."

Hua Youmeng frowned slightly, a hint of confusion flickering in her eyes. But seeing the sincerity in Yang Kai’s expression, she dismissed her doubts — after all, with strength like his, there was no reason for deceit. Composing herself, she said earnestly, “I have wronged you, my Lord. Please do not hold it against me.”

"Stop calling me ‘Lord’ so often; it makes me uncomfortable. I only want Chairwoman Hua to know that I came here with no ulterior motive, merely by chance, and I harbor no designs upon your Commerce Guild." Yang Kai looked at Hua Youmeng earnestly.

"I believe you." Seeing his heartfelt candor, Hua Youmeng believed him and hesitated, "But if not ‘Lord’, how should I address you... Senior?"

Yang Kai cleared his throat, "Just call me Yang Kai."

"I dare not!" Hua Youmeng hastily waved her hand.

"Fine, suit yourself." Yang Kai did not wish to argue further, pushed the tray back toward her, and said, "These Jadeblood Exquisite Fruits are of no real use to me—merely tasty. If Chairwoman Hua takes them, they can purify your Saint Yuan; take them back."

Hua Youmeng’s face brightened and she looked at Yang Kai with gratitude, "Thank you, Lord."

She had paid a high price to purchase that tray of spirit fruit; it was extremely rare. If not for concern over Yang Kai’s status and strength, Hua Youmeng would never have done such a thing—ordinarily a thrifty guild leader, she would not be so wasteful.

"Hmm, someone is looking for you outside." Yang Kai’s expression shifted as he glanced toward the door.

Hua Youmeng turned to look and saw no one at first, but then a figure hurried over—Gao Hong.

Gao Hong’s face still bore a look of surprise, as if something fortunate had occurred.

"Please wait a moment, Lord; I’ll be right back." Hua Youmeng said and promptly withdrew.

Outside, when she met Gao Hong, the two spoke in low voices; after a short while Hua Youmeng’s expression turned startled as she asked, "Really?"

Gao Hong nodded solemnly, and Hua Youmeng’s eyes lit up with delight as she said, “Come with me and take a look.”

With that said, she hurried off.

A short time later, inside the Five Directions Commerce Guild, Hua Youmeng appeared neatly dressed. Present in the shop were Xia Jingwu, Haitang, and Yao Qing, all waiting quietly; besides them stood a group of armored warriors led by a fair-faced large man, all standing solemnly.

Their attire made it clear they were the guards of Purple Star City—the same sort of people as Bai Zhengchu and Lu Tianfeng from yesterday.

Upon seeing Hua Youmeng, the fair-faced man leading the group quickly cupped his fists respectfully and said, “You must be the renowned President Hua of the Five Directions Commerce Guild?”

Startled, Hua Youmeng hurriedly returned the greeting and replied, “I wouldn’t dare accept such praise. I am Hua Youmeng. Greetings, Lord.”

"Chairwoman Hua is too polite." The fair-faced man took on the manner of a conciliator. "Allow me to introduce myself. I am Qu Zheng, Deputy Commander of Purple Star City."

"Deputy Commander Qu, your fame precedes you. I did not know you would come to our Commerce Guild today—what is the matter?" Although she had already received some news from Gao Hong, Hua Youmeng asked to be certain.

"I was ordered by Lord Lu to come and deliver these things to Chairwoman Hua." Saying this, he produced a jade box from a Spatial Ring and handed it over respectfully.

Hua Youmeng took the jade box with a solemn expression.

Upon opening the box, she found many neatly stacked land deeds. Drawing one out, Hua Youmeng exclaimed, "Land deeds!"

Xia Jingwu and the others froze, and even Gao Hong gaped.

Although Qu Zheng had said he had good news for the Commerce Guild earlier, he had not been specific; seeing the land deeds now, everyone finally understood.

"So many land deeds?" Hua Youmeng was utterly stunned and carefully took them out one by one—there were more than thirty, each representing ownership of a shop.

"Heh heh, please don’t be embarrassed, Chairwoman Hua. These deeds cover all the shops along Tenglong Avenue where your Commerce Guild is located." Qu Zheng explained with a smile. "Lord Lu said that although your Commerce Guild is small, you have always conducted business honestly and contributed greatly to the development of Purple Star City, serving as an example to countless merchants. He wished to award these deeds in recognition, hoping other merchants would emulate your guild."

Hua Youmeng trembled and could hardly believe it; each deed felt so weighty in her hands it seemed about to crush her.

"Please, Chairwoman Hua, do not refuse." Qu Zheng reached out to interrupt her and said gravely, "I am only following orders; if you refuse, I will not be able to report back and may be punished in the Cold Prison. I have heard that Chairwoman Hua is kind-hearted and charitable; please do not put me in a difficult position."

Hua Youmeng looked at Qu Zheng, a mixture of laughter and tears on her face.

Qu Zheng immediately pressed his advantage and said with a grin, "In that case, if Chairwoman Hua accepts, I can return and report with peace of mind."

"What am I to do?" Even the usually decisive and wise Hua Youmeng was dazed and unsure how to handle this; after some time she said, "Uncle Xia, quickly prepare a few small gifts; our guests must have worked hard."

She also knew that now that Qu Zheng had put it this way, the deeds could not possibly be taken back.

Uncle Xia answered and hurried to make preparations.

Qu Zheng was shocked and insisted, "Chairwoman Hua, please do not do that; we were only doing our duty and dare not accept rewards. Your words shame us."

The other guards looked pale as if Uncle Xia’s humble gifts were some terrible menace to be avoided.

Qu Zheng stood anxiously, wiping the cold sweat from his brow, glancing from time to time toward the rear courtyard of the Commerce Guild.

After a while, a voice carried to his ears: "Enough, return. Tell Lu Tianfeng that his handling of this matter was excellent. I am very satisfied."

Qu Zheng breathed as if pardoned, turned toward that direction, cupped his fists, and bowed, "Thank you, Lord!"

Saying that, he quickly retreated and, calling back to Hua Youmeng, “I’ll be taking my leave — President Hua, no need to see me off, no need!”

No sooner had the words fallen than he had disappeared like smoke; only his retreating figure could be seen in the distance.
