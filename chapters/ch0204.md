## Chapter 204 — The Little Junior Sister's Grievance

Yao Wang Valley! Yang Kai naturally knew of this place. It was a very special force, filled with alchemists proficient in pill refinement. The people within Yao Wang Valley might not possess high cultivation levels or formidable skills, and their overall combat power could even be said to be inferior to first-rate forces, only slightly stronger than second-rate ones.

Yet, despite being such a force, its heritage was far more ancient than any other. It was said that it had been passed down for thousands of years. Over such a long span of time, even many superpowers had faded into the annals of history, but Yao Wang Valley remained indomitable.

Its status was transcendent; even the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu did not dare to underestimate the existence of Yao Wang Valley. Every year, countless martial artists brought materials to Yao Wang Valley, seeking the help of those alchemical masters to refine pills. Yao Wang Valley had intricate ties with every force.

In other words, anyone who dared to harm Yao Wang Valley would be making an enemy of the entire world!

There were rumors that a sect leader from a major faction once went to Yao Wang Valley to request the assistance of an expert in pill refinement, but for some unknown reason, he was refused. Enraged, the sect leader took action and killed the alchemist.

This caused a massive uproar; with a single call to arms from Yao Wang Valley, that major faction was annihilated overnight.

Such rumors may not be entirely true, but where there’s smoke, there’s fire. This illustrates just how terrifying Yao Wang Valley's influence was.

Moreover, Wan Yao Pool was a forbidden area within Yao Wang Valley. It was said that miracles often occurred there, and many proficient alchemists gained insights into pill refinement from the founding ancestor of Yao Wang Valley.

The Wordless Black Book revealed such a line of text, leaving Yang Kai somewhat puzzled. Did it mean he had to go to Wan Yao Pool in Yao Wang Valley to find something?

Although he had such speculation, Yang Kai certainly would not go there now.

Firstly, he knew nothing about pill refinement, and he would only be driven away if he went. Secondly, he needed to improve his own strength first. Then he could think of a good way to safely infiltrate Yao Wang Valley and act accordingly.

After putting away the Wordless Black Book, Yang Kai spread his hand, and with a pull, a package on the ground was drawn towards him.

This package contained items lost by overseas forces three hundred years ago, and now they had fallen into his hands. He should make good use of them.

Previously, when he was on Hidden Island, Yang Kai had wanted to refine a secret treasure for himself, but at that time, he was still overseas and feared triggering the restrictions within those treasures, alerting the sects they originally belonged to.

Now it was different; he had returned to Lingxiao Pavilion, a distance of over one hundred thousand miles from overseas. Even if the restrictions were triggered, they could not transmit such a long distance. He could use them cautiously in the future without worrying about any issues.

There were three secret treasures. Aside from the Tai Yi Seal, which required a special mental method to activate, the remaining sword and the Blood Sea Begonia could be refined.

The sword was three feet long, entirely crimson, as if blood flowed within it. After sensing it slightly, Yang Kai was shocked to hear the cries of agony emanating from the sword, filled with murderous intent, disturbing the mind. Those with weak wills who heard such sounds would likely fall into madness on the spot, forever descending into the path of evil.

This fierce object was none other than the Shura Sword, the sect-protecting treasure of the Shura Sect!

Yang Kai, however, looked on with delight, feeling a strange affinity with this sword. The fierce and malevolent aura it emanated was quite similar to the aura he released when unleashing his Unyielding Will. It was this similarity that allowed him to feel little barrier between himself and the sword.

This was excellent; at the very least, it was a Heaven-Grade Upper-Level secret treasure, and it was a sword of slaughter. With this sword in hand, his attack power would soar.

After placing the Shura Sword down, Yang Kai picked up the Blood Sea Begonia, which was as red as blood. It resembled a begonia flower, but it looked extraordinarily enchanting, with petals sharp as blades, exuding a strange and dangerous aura.

Even after being sealed for three hundred years, the murderous intent of this begonia flower remained undiminished.

Another secret treasure for slaughter! Back in the day, the Falling Flower Sect must have relied on this treasure to kill countless enemies, staining it with this blood-like hue.

Both secret treasures were excellent, seemingly tailor-made for him. Yang Kai looked at one, then the other, finding it hard to choose.

After a moment's contemplation, Yang Kai steeled his resolve and decided to refine both, as it would only consume a bit more Primordial Qi and time.

Just as he was about to take action, however, some rubble suddenly fell from above.

Yang Kai looked up and smiled faintly. In this cave, only two people knew its location: Su Yan and Xia Ningshang.

Since Su Yan had just left, she would certainly not return. There was no need to guess who the newcomer was.

Sure enough, moments later, Xia Ningshang flew in from above. Yang Kai was standing at the cave entrance, and the two nearly collided.

Yang Kai sidestepped and reached out to pull her, ensuring she landed safely beside him. He smiled at her, “Little Junior Sister, I’m back.”

Xia Ningshang’s eyes sparkled with uncontainable joy and excitement upon their reunion, her face still veiled, and a sapphire still adorning her forehead. Hearing Yang Kai's nonchalant words, her eyes blinked, nearly shedding tears.

A few months ago, when he left, he hadn’t even said goodbye, only leaving a letter! Now that he was back, he didn’t even inform her; how heartless could he be?

Seeing her eyes redden, Yang Kai dared not say anything foolish, fearing he might accidentally make her cry.

“How did you know I was back?” Yang Kai shifted her attention.

“Su Yan told me.” Xia Ningshang sniffed, suppressing the bitterness in her heart, twisting her clothes, and said softly, “If she hadn’t said anything, I wouldn’t have known.”

“I was just about to tell you.” Yang Kai felt a bit guilty.

“Really?” Xia Ningshang looked up at him, her eyes filled with joy.

“Of course.” Yang Kai nodded vigorously.

Little Junior Sister was easy to coax; with just a few words, he dispelled her disappointment and grievances, leaving only joy and happiness.

“You still have a bit of conscience.” Xia Ningshang pouted.

“I even brought you a gift.” Yang Kai made an outrageous claim.

“No need.” Although she said that, Xia Ningshang was clearly smiling, her eyes crescent-shaped, filled with sweetness and satisfaction.

“What kind of gift?” She became curious again.

Yang Kai smiled slightly, stood up, and walked to another large package, untying it and pointing at a large bundle of rare materials, “Some herbs.”

“So many!” Xia Ningshang was taken aback, stepping forward. After just a glance, she already recognized the names and grades of these herbs.

“Don’t you need to take pills while cultivating? See if there’s anything you need; just take it.” Yang Kai said grandly, feeling a bit guilty in his heart. He had gone out and hadn’t thought to bring back some gifts for Su Yan and Xia Ningshang. That was truly inconsiderate.

“I don’t need any.” Xia Ningshang examined the herbs one by one, then looked up and said, “I’ll help you refine them into pills.”

“That’s too much trouble.” Refining all these herbs into pills would take an unknown number of days.

“It’s not troublesome.” Xia Ningshang chuckled, “When I refine pills, it’s also a form of cultivation, and it’s even faster than meditating. The higher the grade of the herbs I refine, the greater the benefits to me. Junior Brother, bringing back these materials for me to practice with is the best gift.”

“You’re not lying to me, are you?” Yang Kai looked at her suspiciously.

“I wouldn’t lie to you.” Xia Ningshang pouted.

“Ahem, I also don’t lie.” Yang Kai’s face turned awkward. “If that’s the case, then I’ll trouble you, Little Junior Sister.”

“Mm, you go ahead and be busy; I’ll refine my pills.” Xia Ningshang was clearly very happy.

Yang Kai watched her for a while, noticing how familiar she was with these herbs. She quickly sorted the large bundle of materials into categories.

With a slight smile, Yang Kai walked to the cave entrance and began attending to his own matters.

Inside the cave, Xia Ningshang hummed lightly as she displayed her remarkable alchemical skills, refining various materials into medicinal liquids and then condensing them into pills.

Time passed slowly. The number of pills Xia Ningshang refined increased, and the large bundle of materials gradually diminished. When she grew tired from refining, she would take a break, glancing at the figure sitting at the cave entrance, and soon she would be satisfied and continue refining.

Every day, Xia Ningshang had to go out for a while. After all, Meng Wuya treated her like a treasure. If she were to go missing one day, Meng would definitely launch a massive search, causing unnecessary trouble.

After four or five days, Yang Kai gradually connected his mind with the Shura Sword.

He could increasingly sense the murderous aura and strength of this secret treasure. It was indeed a Heaven-Grade Upper-Level treasure; just this one item could elevate Yang Kai's combat power to a new level.

Drawing the Shura Sword into his body, Yang Kai couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief.

Spending so many days refining it was quite a burden for Yang Kai. The Yang Liquid in his Dantian, which was already low, was further depleted.

He needed to find a way to replenish the Yang Liquid.

Looking up, Yang Kai activated his movement technique and dashed out. In a short while, he returned, holding two Spirit Herbs in his hands.

These were the Pureheart Seeds he had planted months ago, which he had bought from Lan Chudie. The two Spirit Herbs had long since matured, and Yang Kai brought them to Xia Ningshang, asking her to refine them into pills. After taking one, he could finally condense some Yang Liquid.

With sufficient Yang Liquid, Yang Kai continued to refine the Blood Sea Begonia.

Several hurried days passed, and this secret treasure from the Falling Flower Sect was finally absorbed into his body.

Having acquired two Heaven-Grade secret treasures in succession, Yang Kai's strength increased tremendously. Although he could not yet unleash the full power of these two treasures, as long as he diligently nurtured them with Primordial Qi, there would come a day when they would shine brilliantly.

The herbs had long been refined by Xia Ningshang, filling over a dozen bottles with various pills.

The pills refined were at least of Earth-Grade quality, with some even reaching Heaven-Grade, their value immeasurable.

If Yang Kai were to consume all these pills, he estimated he could at least elevate one or two small realms. However, there were too many, and if he were to consume them all at once, it would undoubtedly take a long time to refine them.

Thus, Yang Kai did not plan to take them right away.

Having been back at the sect for half a month, it was time to go out and check the situation. The three major forces still lingering in Lingxiao Pavilion had their young masters eyeing Su Yan. Yang Kai could not sit idly by.

That was his woman!
