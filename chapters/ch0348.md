## Chapter 348 — I am the Demon General Meng Ge

Over a dozen miles away, in Ghost King Valley, the members of Baoqi Sect and the Sisters from the Hu Family were hurrying back.

“Why are all of you following us?” Hu Jiao’er asked with a bitter smile while running alongside her sister.

“Then why are you coming back?” Leng Shan retorted.

“Our relationship with him is different!” Hu Jiao’er replied. As soon as the words left her mouth, many gazes turned toward her. Realizing the ambiguity in her words, she quickly added, “We’ve known each other for a long time. Blood Battle Gang and Lingxiao Pavilion are neighbors.”

Upon hearing this, everyone finally understood why Yang Kai and the Sisters from the Hu Family had seemed quite close before; there was this deeper connection between them.

“Returning could very well mean death!” Hu Jiao’er’s voice turned heavy.

Leng Shan sneered, “That’s for you. We are at least part of Ghost King Valley, under the jurisdiction of Yinming Ghost King. The Chimeras and Demons may not necessarily target us.”

Shen Yi nodded, “That's right. It would be better for you, Tao brothers, not to wade into this muddy water.”

Tao Yang smiled nonchalantly, “We are from Baoqi Sect. We won’t die that easily. Those four old men should still possess some rationality and understand our value.”

“You all… sigh!” Hu Jiao’er fell silent. She knew that this group of people was only making excuses for themselves, really wanting to help.

After all, Yang Kai had saved them from dire situations time and again. Now, if they were to abandon him in his time of trouble, it would be hard to face their own conscience.

But what use would they be against those four grandmasters?

Just ants shaking a tree!

While they were racing ahead, a thunderous roar suddenly echoed from that direction, followed by the green light surrounding the Sisters from the Hu Family bursting apart, vanishing into thin air.

Everyone quickly halted, gazing at them in surprise.

“What’s going on?” Hu Jiao’er asked, puzzled. “Didn’t you say that unless that old man dies, the Clinging Bone Shadow would not be broken?”

The crowd froze, suddenly realizing something, their faces turning pale.

“No way? It’s only been a short while,” Shen Yi said in disbelief.

Less than half an hour had passed since the Chimeras and Demons had left; could they really have already died? But if that wasn’t the case, why had the Clinging Bone Shadow surrounding the Sisters from the Hu Family broken apart so suddenly?

Those four individuals had been invincible in the Divine Roaming Realm when working together. What kind of danger could make them lose their lives in such a short time?

Whoosh, whoosh...

Two figures suddenly flew towards them. The crowd hurriedly became alert and looked up, only to see two of the Chimeras and Demons approaching rapidly.

One was the blue-clad elder who had kidnapped Yang Kai, and the other was the purple-clad elder. The elder dressed in yellow and green was absent.

Moreover, these two were no longer as arrogant and domineering as before. Their faces were pale, blood dripping from the corners of their mouths, and dark auras twisted around their bodies like venomous snakes, making them appear especially terrifying.

Both were gravely injured, and the arm of the blue-clad elder hung limply by his side, clearly broken. The purple-clad elder had five bloody holes in his abdomen, looking as though someone had punctured him with their fingers. As he ran, streams of bright red blood flowed from his wounds, splattering along the way.

The absence of Yang Kai made everyone’s heart sink.

The two appeared panicked, rushing overhead like the wind, not even glancing at the others, as if they were terrified.

Their flight and panic further cast a shadow of dread over the hearts of the crowd.

Four individuals had gone, and within half an hour, two had died, while the other two were gravely injured and fleeing. The danger they faced was something these young people could not confront. If they continued to delve deeper, they would likely face certain death.

And whether Yang Kai was still alive remained a mystery; he might already be dead.

“Sister...” Hu Mei’er softly called out, her expression firm as she gazed ahead.

“En.” Hu Jiao’er nodded coldly, remaining silent. Together, the two of them, like a long rainbow, dashed inside with lightning speed.

The members of Ghost King Valley and Baoqi Sect exchanged glances, and without hesitation, they followed suit.

...

Yang Kai focused his True Essence, cautiously and boldly approaching the battlefield.

Before long, he laid eyes on the corpses of the green-clad elder and the yellow-clad elder. Seeing their state, Yang Kai couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

These two, although not top-tier in personal strength, only reaching the Seventh or Eighth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm, were formidable when combined, as Leng Shan had mentioned.

The so-called Demonic Spirit had managed to break their combined tactics in a mere moment and kill two of them. Its powerful strength left no room for doubt.

Both of their corpses were in a horrendous state; one had half of its body obliterated, while the other was a bloody mess, looking utterly tragic. The nature of their wounds indicated they had been killed by the Demonic Spirit in a single strike, without even having the time to react.

From nearby came the sound of ragged breathing. Yang Kai quickly looked up.

Just over ten zhang away stood an extremely burly figure, bare-chested and wild-looking, pinned to the ground by a spear several zhang long.

It was the Demonic Spirit!

This was the Demonic Spirit that had emerged from the giant cocoon, gathered from all the corrupted fountain water and the essences of hundreds of evil spirits.

Unlike the evil spirits, it possessed a complete body, with limbs and facial features, and looked no different from a human.

Only, dark, ink-like auras swirled around its body, each containing terrifying energy.

Noticing Yang Kai’s arrival, the Demonic Spirit merely glanced at him with indifference, clearly not considering him a threat.

At the same time, several black auras shot directly toward Yang Kai.

Even as the demonic energy churned, Yang Kai remained calm, raising his hand to block the attack, a barrier of True Yang Primordial Qi forming in front of him.

Puff, puff, puff...

The demonic energy crashed against the barrier, pushing Yang Kai back a few steps but failing to breach his defenses.

The Demonic Spirit regarded Yang Kai with some surprise, seemingly not expecting him to possess such a skill. After hesitating for a moment, it actually grinned menacingly at Yang Kai.

Then, it extended a powerfully muscled hand, gripping the spear embedded in its abdomen. With a roar, it slowly pulled the spear out.

This spear was likely a treasure belonging to the Chimeras and Demons; relying on its power, only the remaining two had the chance to escape.

As the spear was pulled out, the Demonic Spirit displayed no signs of pain. Instead, it wore a grotesque expression of excitement, blood pouring out, yet the blood that flowed from the Demonic Spirit was not red, but a strange purple hue.

Before it could completely pull the spear out, Yang Kai was already moving.

A loud clang of chains being swung echoed as a treasure suddenly flew out from Yang Kai's body, radiating pure, scorching energy as it spread out.

Under the influence of this energy, the Demonic Spirit trembled spontaneously, and the dark auras swirling around it shrank back into its body.

Clang, clang...

The sound of chains in the air grew increasingly crisp and resonant, seemingly harboring a mysterious power that made the Demonic Spirit wary.

In an instant, the chains fully unfurled, less than three feet long, with a simple collar design at the end, somewhat resembling a dog chain.

Locking Demon Chain! Yang Kai had acquired this treasure from Dragon Confinement Ravine and had been nourishing it with True Yang Primordial Qi in his dantian ever since, but it had never shown any effect until now.

Had it not been for the existence of the Locking Demon Chain, Yang Kai would not have recklessly rushed in here.

The Locking Demon Chain was a treasure left behind by the founder of Lingxiao Pavilion, and it could restrain the demonic energy of the monster at the bottom of Dragon Confinement Ravine. It should be capable of subduing this Demonic Spirit too.

When the Locking Demon Chain fully manifested, the previously indifferent Demonic Spirit finally appeared alarmed, its expression changing drastically as it exclaimed, “True Yang treasure, a nemesis to demonic energy!”

While speaking, it abruptly yanked the spear out, disregarding its injuries, and with all its might, hurled the spear at the Locking Demon Chain.

With a sharp whistle, the spear almost instantaneously broke through the barriers of space, appearing before the Locking Demon Chain in a bizarre fashion.

Yet this earth-shattering strike simply went astray.

The Locking Demon Chain suddenly radiated brilliant golden light, and the spear passed right through it. In the next moment, with a flash of golden light, the Locking Demon Chain appeared around the neck of the Demonic Spirit, catching it perfectly.

A sizzling sound echoed as if scalding hot water had been poured over the Demonic Spirit. White smoke began to billow from its body, the dark demonic energy surrounding it swiftly suppressed within.

A scream erupted as the gigantic body of the Demonic Spirit thrashed violently. It gripped the Locking Demon Chain with both hands, attempting to snap it, but no matter how hard it tried, it couldn’t budge an inch. Instead, its hands were scalded, with white smoke swirling around, and cries of agony followed.

The Locking Demon Chain flickered erratically, its brightness fluctuating.

The dark demonic energy enveloping the Demonic Spirit also alternated between visibility and repression.

Both entities were evidently locked in a fierce struggle.

Yang Kai wore a serious expression, quickly retreating, filled with suspicion.

He had not expected this Demonic Spirit could even talk.

Having witnessed its emergence, he knew it was formed from the essence found in the Evil Spirit Spring Eye, gathering water and essences of hundreds of evil spirits.

Such a being, he thought, should lack any cognition, essentially possessing only instinct.

Yet it could tell at a glance that the Locking Demon Chain was a nemesis to demonic energy! This situation clearly felt unusual.

Yang Kai’s expression flickered, unsure of how to interpret everything happening before him.

The battle between the Demonic Spirit and the Locking Demon Chain did not last long, merely the span of an incense stick, before a victor emerged.

The Locking Demon Chain completely subdued the Demonic Spirit’s demonic energy, and the Demonic Spirit ceased to resist, sitting cross-legged on the ground while grinning sinisterly at Yang Kai.

There was no trace of fear or dread of impending death; instead, its interest seemed piqued, its eyes sparkling with excitement.

“Kid, I am the Demon General Meng Ge. You dare harm my remnant soul, and I will remember you. If there’s an opportunity in the future, I will personally capture you and make you wish for life but not have it, and wish for death but be unable to die!”
