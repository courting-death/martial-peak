## Chapter 756 — You, Villain

Beneath the sea at a depth of ten thousand zhang, at a certain spot within an ancient ruin.

Within a radius of one hundred zhang, more than a hundred martial artists lay scattered in disarray; most were dead, while only a man and a woman still showed faint signs of life, though both remained unconscious.

In front of those warriors floated a glowing sphere, emitting bizarre energy fluctuations; as the energy rose and fell its halo flickered, as if it might collapse at any moment.

Suddenly, a streak of golden color flowed across the sphere, and as that gold appeared the space grew hot.

The golden hue spread like autumn wind sweeping fallen leaves, quickly enveloping the entire sphere and turning it brilliantly radiant, like a blazing sun; the heat in the air intensified.

Crack...

The sound of something breaking rang out.

At the same time, two streams of soul energy shot out from the glowing sphere, circled in midair, then flew downward.

The golden sphere gradually dimmed, and after a while no light emanated from it.

With a soft cry, An Ling'er slowly and laboriously opened her eyes, propped herself up with her hands, sat upright, and scanned her surroundings; not far off she saw Yang Kai also slowly pulling himself up.

They exchanged a glance and both smiled.

Inside the Court of Divine Battle, having located the Secret Treasure to be refined, Yang Kai had used his powerful Divine Sense to burn at those four characters; he didn't know how long had passed, and only just now had he succeeded in subduing that Secret Treasure.

After sharing such hardships, An Ling'er suddenly found Yang Kai much more pleasing to the eye, and Yang Kai thought the girl was not bad—just a little foolish at times; while he was refining the Secret Treasure she had not interrupted him, quietly keeping watch from afar.

Having subdued the Divine Soul Secret Treasure, leaving became simple: open an exit with Divine Thought and the two could escape the predicament.

Their spirit bodies had been separated from their flesh for some time, so returning felt awkward at first. Yang Kai fared better—his Divine Sense cultivation and physical strength were considerably greater than An Ling'er's—whereas An Ling'er, after confirming Yang Kai had returned, sat cross‑legged and silently circulated her profound arts to recuperate.

Yang Kai rested briefly, and after confirming his body suffered no ill effects he rose and walked to where the Divine Soul Secret Treasure lay.

Now that he had refined it, the Secret Treasure naturally belonged to Yang Kai.

Standing before it, he moved his Divine Thought and stored it into his Sea of Consciousness.

Examining the Secret Treasure closely, Yang Kai's spirit stirred with admiration; fitting for a relic left by an ancient Sect, this Divine Soul Secret Treasure was unquestionably Saint‑Grade, and despite the passage of untold years its power had scarcely diminished.

Nurtured within Yang Kai's Sea of Consciousness, with time it would surely restore to its original potency.

Yang Kai was greatly satisfied; this trip had not been in vain. He had already been elated at acquiring a Pill with a Pill Cloud, and now he had gained a Divine Soul Secret Treasure well suited to him—his harvest surpassed everyone else's.

Regaining his attention, Yang Kai looked around. An Ling'er remained meditating; Hai Wangu and the others were completely dead. Yang Kai considered briefly, approached the corpses, took their Spatial Pouches, searched through them, kept the valuables, and tossed aside the worthless.

Standing in place and waiting for about half a day, An Ling'er finally opened her beautiful eyes; after that period of recuperation she had at last recovered.

Seeing Yang Kai seemingly watching over her, the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land pursed her lips and smiled, a strange trace of sweetness swelling in her heart.

She moved like a lotus to Yang Kai's side and asked, "Shall we return now or continue exploring?"

"I want to continue; there is something I want to figure out. As for you…do as you please," Yang Kai said indifferently, then strode forward.

Seeing Yang Kai's apparently cold attitude toward her, An Ling'er pouted and silently hurried to keep pace.

Entering the great hall ahead and searching through it, Yang Kai couldn't help frowning.

This hall had originally been guarded behind the Court of Divine Battle; Hai Wangu and the elder surnamed Cheng and over a hundred martial artists had earlier combined to break that invisible barrier, intending to search this hall for treasures.

Unexpectedly, after the barrier was broken everyone's spirit bodies had been pulled into the Court of Divine Battle, foiling their original plan.

When Yang Kai and An Ling'er returned, they found clear signs someone had beaten them here— the hall had been ransacked and nothing of value remained.

"Someone else explored here already, right?" An Ling'er guessed.

Yang Kai nodded slightly in agreement.

Although over a hundred had been drawn into the Court of Divine Battle, many others were still active throughout the ancient ruin.

Who knew how much time had passed; the ruins had likely been thoroughly searched by them.

Realizing this, Yang Kai didn't waste time and left the hall, heading straight toward the source of the Yang attribute energy.

Although it might have been a month or two since they had arrived at the seabed, the Yang attribute energy there continued to emit without end.

Yang Kai was eager to know what lay ahead.

An Ling'er said little so as not to annoy him and obediently followed step for step.

Yang Kai knew she hadn't given up trying to persuade him to return to the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, so he deliberately ignored her.

After walking a long way, Yang Kai felt himself drawing nearer to the energy source, and within the Yang attribute fluctuations he detected an unusual disturbance.

It was the power of the void!

Yang Kai immediately sensed something was wrong; this trip might yield no gain.

Sure enough, at a corner his steps stopped; he frowned and stared ahead with a helpless expression.

An Ling'er saw his odd look, glanced over, covered her mouth, and cried out in surprise, "A Void Passage?"

Not far ahead, about three zhang above the ground, there was a pitch‑black, deep opening—the Void Passage.

The Yang attribute energy and the void power Yang Kai had sensed both emanated from that opening.

"How can there be a Void Passage here?" An Ling'er was astonished. Void Passages were uncommon—some said they were scars left when ancient experts tore space during great battles, while others claimed they generated spontaneously.

By studying their mysteries, some strong figures now could manipulate void power to construct similar passages and teleport themselves tens of thousands of li in an instant.

Chu Lingxiao of the Tianxiao Sect possessed such an ability!

But it consumed tremendous energy, so even someone like Chu Lingxiao would not lightly construct one.

Those passages made by strong figures differed greatly from authentic ones in both stability and range.

The presence of a Void Passage in these ancient ruins surprised An Ling'er.

No one knew where it led—perhaps somewhere on the Tongxuan Continent, perhaps an isolated Small Xuan Realm—the outcome was unpredictable.

"Let's go back!" Yang Kai said coolly. Although he was curious about the Yang attribute source, he would not rashly enter a Void Passage and risk being flung into the starry sky with no way home.

Saying that, he ignored An Ling'er and vaulted upward.

"Wait for me!" An Ling'er called and hurried to catch up.

Soon the two reached the ruin's barrier, pierced it, and found themselves in seawater.

In an instant Yang Kai felt an immense pressure from all sides, as if it would crush him to pieces.

Under that crushing pressure Yang Kai hurriedly circulated his True Yuan to clear the surrounding water, and the strain eased considerably.

An Ling'er was quicker still, slipping into Yang Kai's True Yuan defense and comfortably staying at his side.

"You woman…" Yang Kai sneered, glancing at her.

"What?"

"Aren't you the Saintess who prides herself on purity and sanctity? Casually staying so close to an unfamiliar man—appropriate?"

"Who is being casual?" An Ling'er protested, somewhat indignant. "Didn't I tell you, you fully deserve to be Saint Lord; if you didn't, I would never be with you even unto death."

“If you dare bring this up with me again, I’ll rape you first and kill you after!” Yang Kai’s expression was ferocious.

"You're only saying that—inside you don't really mean it," An Ling'er seemed to see through Yang Kai's nature and showed no fear.

Yang Kai ground his teeth and glared at her viciously, sneering a few cold laughs. "You enjoy provoking me, don't you? Believe it or not, I'll deal with you now."

"You dare!" An Ling'er stared at him.

Yang Kai flashed a brilliant smile and suddenly retracted much of his outwardly projected True Yuan; the defensive shield that had enclosed them shrank into a much smaller space.

An Ling'er cried out and hurriedly pressed against Yang Kai, afraid her body would be exposed to the seawater.

Yang Kai continued to reduce his True Yuan output; the shield's volume kept decreasing.

The noble, holy Saintess leaned closer and gripped his chest cloth with her small hand; her pretty face went pale, she ground her teeth inwardly, yet dared not utter another word.

After a moment An Ling'er's face flushed.

As the shield shrank she had to cling to Yang Kai like an octopus, her delicate body pressed tightly; her two full mounds pressed against Yang Kai's broad chest.

Though she inwardly resisted with all her might, she had no choice but to maintain that humiliating posture.

“You wicked man, you’re a demon!” An Ling'er bit her red lip before Yang Kai, her breath fragrant as orchids and lovely eyes glistening with tears.
