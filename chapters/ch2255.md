## Chapter 2255 — Are You Satisfied Now?

This was indeed the case. In the Eight Directions Sect, everyone feared Luo Yuan—not just these people, but even the Sect Master and Vice Sect Master were deeply wary of him. The Sect Master had said that Luo Yuan was a genius unseen in ten thousand years, destined to shake the Star Realm and stand above the heavens. So the entire Eight Directions Sect catered to his every demand, pinning all hopes of the sect’s revival on Luo Yuan.

In the sect, Luo Yuan’s words were as good as the Sect Master’s. He occupied the best cave residence and controlled nearly half of the Eight Directions Sect’s cultivation resources. When he cultivated, no one dared disturb him—otherwise, it meant death!

This was the main reason why these people from the Eight Directions Sect wanted to settle things peacefully earlier—they didn’t dare alarm Luo Yuan!

But in the end, they still ended up disturbing him.

For a moment, the Eight Directions Sect disciples were both shocked and delighted — shocked because Luo Yuan seemed to be in a bad mood and might punish them, yet delighted because a powerful ally had arrived and they might be saved.

“Ah... it’s you!” Only now did the round-faced girl standing behind Luo Yuan come to her senses. Her infatuated gaze left Luo Yuan as she looked around, and when she saw Yang Kai, she cried out, “You’re that... that...”

For a moment, she couldn’t recall Yang Kai’s name.

Yang Kai smiled slightly and said, “Yang Kai!”

"Yes, you’re the one who traded a Supreme Mystic Pill with me in the Four Seasons Land." The round-faced girl clearly remembered Yang Kai.

“Why can’t I be here?” Yang Kai found it amusing.

The round-faced girl tilted her head, thinking it over, and realized her question was a bit silly. She smiled at Yang Kai and said nothing more.

Meanwhile, Luo Yuan’s gaze locked onto Yang Kai, and the once-calm eyes now flickered with boundless fighting spirit.

Yang Kai grinned. “How long have you been here?”

Luo Yuan replied coolly, “Just arrived!” After a pause, he added, “I was awakened by the aura of your Secret Treasure. Then I saw you trying to kill my Eight Directions Sect disciples.”

His tone was calm, but anyone could hear the displeasure and chill in his words.

No matter what, he was a member of the Eight Directions Sect. If someone wanted to kill its disciples, he couldn’t just stand by.

The middle-aged man was overjoyed and quickly shouted, “Junior Brother Luo, this man relies on his abilities and completely disregards our Eight Directions Sect. He knocked out Junior Brother Lin Yun and injured me. Please, Junior Brother Luo, avenge us!”

He completely changed his previous submissive attitude toward Yang Kai, becoming arrogant as if he’d found a powerful backer, feeling much safer and no longer needing to fear Yang Kai.

“Is that so?” Luo Yuan raised his eyebrows and looked coldly at Yang Kai. “Is it true?”

Yang Kai smiled. “That’s right. The one lying over there was knocked out by me, and the one talking was injured by me.”

“Good, a man should own up to his actions!” Luo Yuan’s lips curled. “That’s how a man should be. I admire you!”

“Brother Luo, are you going to stand up for them?” Yang Kai looked at him with a smile.

“I’ve been stuck at a bottleneck in a secret art I’m cultivating. No matter how much I pondered, I couldn’t break through...” Luo Yuan suddenly changed the subject, but the fighting spirit in his eyes only grew fiercer. As he spoke, his Origin Qi surged and he shouted, “I’ve been looking for a worthy opponent in this backwater place. Since you’re here, Brother Yang, help me out!”

“You want to use me to break through your bottleneck?” Yang Kai looked at him strangely.

“Exactly!”

“And why should I help you?” Yang Kai snorted. “That’s a losing deal. I’m not interested!”

“You have no choice.” Luo Yuan snorted coldly, stepping through the air toward Yang Kai. With each step, his aura climbed higher.

From the look of it, whether Yang Kai agreed or not, Luo Yuan was going to make a move.

Yang Kai frowned.

Luo Yuan was no ordinary Dao Origin Realm cultivator. Not only was he at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm, but his combat strength was also formidable. If possible, Yang Kai didn’t want to fight him—especially here at the Qin Family. If they really fought, the Qin Family’s estate would likely be destroyed, and Qin Yu and the others might be caught up in it.

He wasn’t as reckless as Luo Yuan, who acted without scruples.

“Stop!” At that moment, Qin Yu suddenly shouted.

Luo Yuan paused, a trace of displeasure flashing across his face. He growled, “Who are you? What do you want?”

His face was full of killing intent, clearly annoyed at being interrupted by Qin Yu. If not for restraining himself, he might have killed her on the spot.

Qin Yu said, “I’m from the Qin Family!”

Luo Yuan frowned, his killing intent quickly fading. He muttered, “The master of this place, huh...”

A trace of helplessness appeared on his face. After thinking for a while, he asked, “What do you want?”

He completely changed from his previous murderous demeanor, becoming gentle and polite, which surprised Yang Kai.

“I wouldn’t dare give orders. You’re all incredibly powerful, and my Qin Family is weak. How could we dare order you around?” Qin Yu’s tone was mocking, her words barbed. “But your Eight Directions Sect disciples killed a member of my Qin Family. Shouldn’t you give us an explanation first?”

“Killed a member of your Qin Family?” Luo Yuan’s face turned cold. “Is that true?”

“The corpse is right there. Are you blind?” Qin Yu gritted her teeth and snapped.

Only then did Luo Yuan look at the female corpse lying in the courtyard. After examining it, he turned to the middle-aged man and asked, “What happened?”

The middle-aged man panicked, not knowing how to answer. He stammered, unable to say anything coherent.

“I’ll count to three. If you don’t answer, you know the consequences!” Luo Yuan’s face grew colder. After speaking, he began to count, “One...”

The middle-aged man immediately began to tremble. He dared not hide anything and spilled everything at once.

After listening, Luo Yuan mused, “So, Brother Yang acted because of this?”

“Y-yes...” The middle-aged man glanced at Yang Kai and nodded, not daring to slander him anymore.

“I understand!” As Luo Yuan spoke, his figure flickered and he darted into the wing room. When he reappeared, he was holding the unconscious Lin Yun.

Yang Kai watched him with interest, wondering how Luo Yuan would deal with Lin Yun and what explanation he would give the Qin Family.

Luo Yuan glanced at Qin Yu and said coolly, “You’re the young lady of the Qin Family, right? He was the one who killed your kin. Since that’s the case, watch closely!”

As he finished, he surged his Origin Qi and poured it madly into Lin Yun’s body.

In an instant, Lin Yun’s whole body swelled, his exposed skin turning blood red.

Seeing this, Yang Kai’s eyes narrowed in shock.

The Eight Directions Sect disciples turned ashen, and the middle-aged man cried out, “Junior Brother Luo, don’t!”

In agony, Lin Yun slowly regained consciousness, still dazed. Not knowing what was happening, he opened his eyes and saw Luo Yuan, then cried out in terror, “Senior Brother Luo!”

“Mm.” Luo Yuan replied casually, increasing his strength.

“Ah...” Lin Yun screamed, realizing something was wrong. “No... don’t...”

Bang...

With a loud explosion, Lin Yun’s body burst apart in Luo Yuan’s hand. Not a bone remained; blood and flesh flew everywhere. Though Luo Yuan stood close, not a speck touched him.

The courtyard was utterly silent.

The Qin Family was completely stunned, while the Eight Directions Sect disciples looked at each other in horror, not daring to breathe.

No one expected Luo Yuan to kill Lin Yun so decisively!

Weren’t they fellow disciples? Wasn’t Lin Yun the Vice Sect Master’s nephew?

Everyone was shocked by Luo Yuan’s cold-blooded cruelty and utter disregard for sentiment.

“Miss Qin, are you satisfied with this outcome?” Luo Yuan asked Qin Yu.

Qin Yu gritted her teeth. “Satisfied!”

The murderer had died before her eyes—what else could she say? A life for a life. Luo Yuan had done it, so she had nothing more to say.

“Good!” Luo Yuan nodded, ignoring everyone else. He looked at Yang Kai again and said, “Brother Yang, let’s begin!”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. “Begin what? What’s there to begin? Can’t you behave for once? Always fighting and killing—what’s the point?”

Qin Chaoyang thought Yang Kai was afraid of Luo Yuan and quickly tried to smooth things over. “Brother Luo, since the culprit has been punished, why not let this old man host everyone for a good talk today?”

Luo Yuan ignored him and looked at Yang Kai. “Brother Yang, you’re really disappointing... Where’s the arrogance and wildness you showed in the Four Seasons Land? Acting so timid—how will you ever reach the Martial Dao’s peak?”

“What peak of the Martial Dao...” Yang Kai curled his lip. “I’m only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Isn’t it a bit early to talk about that?”

“How far you see is how far you’ll go!” Luo Yuan said. “Brother Yang, you shouldn’t be so shortsighted.”

Yang Kai replied seriously, “Wrong, completely wrong!”

Luo Yuan was surprised. “What’s wrong with it?”

Yang Kai said, “I think a person should take one step at a time, be steady and practical. If you think too much, you’ll just aim too high and achieve nothing.”

Luo Yuan frowned. “Without lofty goals, where does the motivation to move forward come from?”

Seeing Luo Yuan’s eagerness to spar, Yang Kai grew impatient and waved him off. “If we can’t see eye to eye, there’s no point in talking. Go do whatever you want.”

“Right now, I just want to fight you, Brother Yang!”

“You’re still not done?” Yang Kai jumped up. “What’s the point of fighting me? With my abilities, can you even touch my clothes?”

“Uh...” Luo Yuan was stunned, suddenly remembering that Yang Kai was skilled in space secret arts. Back in the Four Seasons Land, surrounded by experts, he’d been so calm because of his mastery of space. Below the Emperor Realm, no one could restrain him.

If he fought Yang Kai, he might not even be able to touch him...

“Just don’t dodge...” Luo Yuan thought for a moment. “Let’s have a real, passionate, bloody clash between men!”

Everyone broke out in a cold sweat.

Yang Kai squinted at him and mocked, “Did you train yourself stupid? If I have secret arts, why wouldn’t I dodge?”
