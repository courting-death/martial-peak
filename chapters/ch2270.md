## Chapter 2270 — Demonic Warhammer

“You’re quite bold. Do your parents know?” Yang Kai sat cross-legged where he was, his eyes cold as he looked at Ye Qinghan.

Ye Qinghan replied in a hoarse voice, “I’ve been an orphan since I was a child.”

Yang Kai was momentarily speechless. After a brief silence, he asked in a deep voice, “What did you see just now?”

“What?” Ye Qinghan asked back, her face full of confusion.

“Nothing.” Yang Kai let out a gentle breath. Ye Qinghan’s tone and expression didn’t seem fake; she probably hadn’t seen anything just now.

“Master Yang…” Ye Qinghan called out hesitantly, “Could you give me a chance to say a few words?”

"Aren’t you speaking now?" Yang Kai replied, completely exhausted and powerless. Although he thought Ye Qinghan likely wouldn’t harm him, he remained cautious and didn’t show his fatigue, quietly resting and recovering his strength.

“Thank you, Master Yang!” Ye Qinghan was overjoyed at his words, thinking her sincerity had finally moved him. Her emotions surged, and after considering her words, she said seriously, “Actually, I came to Master Yang just to ask for a favor.”

Yang Kai closed his eyes and focused, ignoring her.

Seeing this, Ye Qinghan continued, “I want to ask Master Yang… Hmm? Master, be careful behind you!”

“What!” Yang Kai was startled, but the next moment he felt a chill rush from behind, as sharp as a blade, slicing painfully into his skin.

His expression changed drastically! He’d been focused on recovering and hadn’t noticed any danger approaching from behind. If not for Ye Qinghan’s warning, he might not have reacted in time.

Deeply shocked, he wondered who could be so skilled as to approach him without being detected.

In a rush, Yang Kai summoned his Origin Qi, leaping into the air and crossing his arms in front of his chest.

Boom…

A massive force struck head-on, slamming into Yang Kai’s arms.

Crack… The sound of bones shifting echoed out.

This time, Yang Kai was truly shocked.

His physical body was incredibly strong; even a direct hit from an Emperor Realm expert wouldn’t dislocate his bones. Yet this mysterious attack managed to do just that.

“Dragon Transformation!” Yang Kai roared. With a high-pitched dragon cry, dragon scales instantly covered his crossed arms, finally blocking the wild force.

“This power…” Yang Kai’s expression grew serious. He suddenly sensed that the force attacking him wasn’t familiar Origin Qi, but another strange, indescribable energy.

He quickly looked up, Divine Sense bursting forth, trying to see who dared to ambush him.

At a glance, Yang Kai gasped.

Not far ahead, a pitch-black figure stood. The figure showed no signs of life, and its form seemed unstable, constantly shifting due to overflowing energy.

Two crimson eyes glared like a beast ready to devour, sending chills down one’s spine.

“Hiss…” Yang Kai’s face darkened. He shouted, “Who are you?”

The figure didn’t answer, just tilted its head at Yang Kai, then swung a fist at him.

Though it was a fist, the force within was like thousands of sharp blades, slicing the surrounding space with a piercing sound.

Having suffered once already, Yang Kai didn’t dare be careless. Flicking his fingers, countless tiny space cracks shot out like a rain of needles, covering the shadow.

The figure seemed to sense danger, its body flickered and retreated from the battle, then stood nearby, tilting its head at Yang Kai.

The shadow’s movements weren’t agile, even stiff and awkward, as if it hadn’t moved in ages. Yet Yang Kai instinctively felt this was a formidable enemy!

Buzz… A strange sound suddenly came from the shadow’s body, and with it, Yang Kai felt a burning heat in his abdomen.

“What?” Yang Kai exclaimed, stepping back swiftly.

Even facing a true Emperor Realm expert, he wouldn’t be so flustered, but now he just wanted to get as far from the shadow as possible.

In that instant, the ancient demonic intent sealed in his abdomen stirred for some unknown reason. Fortunately, the gold and silver sealing power of the Firmament Tree suppressed it immediately, or Yang Kai would have fallen into a demonic state again.

This shadow… is it related to the Ancient Giant Demon? An unimaginable thought sprang up in Yang Kai’s mind, his face turning pale.

Though the demonic intent in his abdomen only surged for a moment, the shadow noticed, and murderous intent flooded the air. A violent aura spread, and black energy surged outward.

“Demonic Qi!” Yang Kai cried out in shock.

Now he was certain the shadow was connected to the Ancient Giant Demon, as their energy fluctuations were nearly identical.

“Kill!” The shadow suddenly spat out a word, then flashed to Yang Kai, punching out. With one blow, the world seemed to shatter and chaos reigned.

Yang Kai’s eyes widened. Not daring to slack off, he flicked his wrist, summoning the Imperial Treasure Myriad Sword. Sword Intent spread, and he called out, “One sword sweeps a million, a lone man holds the pass!”

Clang, clang…

Sword cries rang out, sword energy whistled, and the sound of slicing filled the air.

A halo of light formed a solid barrier before Yang Kai. The shadow’s punch landed, making Yang Kai’s body tremble, nearly disrupting his Sword Intent.

“Master Yang, I’ll help you!” Ye Qinghan’s voice trembled, showing her fear, but she bravely flew over. The bracelet on her pale wrist shot out, and with a series of hand seals, it grew to the size of a basin, whistling toward the shadow.

“Get back!” Yang Kai shouted.

Though Ye Qinghan’s cultivation was now similar to his, she was no match for the shadow. A single mistake would mean death.

His warning came too late. The bracelet spun and struck the shadow’s head. The shadow didn’t react or defend, letting the attack land.

Bang… It was like hitting something solid. The bracelet flashed wildly, and was instantly tainted by a trace of Demonic Qi, losing its spirit.

“Pfft…” Ye Qinghan spat out a mouthful of blood, her aura weakening.

That bracelet was her life-bound Secret Treasure. With it damaged, she suffered backlash, and in terror, quickly recalled it.

Looking down, she saw black energy coiling around the bracelet, slowly spreading and threatening to corrode it further.

Ye Qinghan was terrified, finally realizing the gap between herself and the shadow.

“Kill!” The hoarse cry rang out again, grating like metal scraping, making one extremely uncomfortable.

Yang Kai maintained his Myriad Sword’s Sword Intent, confronting the shadow. His gaze was heavy as he asked, “Who exactly are you, and what is your connection to the one-eyed giant demon?”

“Kill!” The shadow seemed not to hear, only repeating the word.

“Looking down on me?” Yang Kai was furious. A golden light flashed in his left eye, and the World-Ending Demon Eye appeared, staring at the shadow.

He wanted to see what this shadow truly was.

At a glance, Yang Kai’s expression turned strange, and he exclaimed, “This… this is…”

Under the World-Ending Demon Eye, Yang Kai saw through illusions and gazed at the shadow’s true form.

He discovered the shadow wasn’t a living being, but something like an Artifact Spirit, just like Liu Yan.

But the shadow hadn’t been born from a Refining Furnace — it had been formed from a hammer.

The hammer was hidden within the shadow, wrapped by it, and was shrouded in endless Demonic Qi. Intricate runes flowed across its surface, seeming to contain supreme Law Power.

At the sight, Yang Kai’s left eye throbbed with pain, and a warm sensation trickled down his cheek.

Forcing himself to stay focused, he examined the hammer’s shape more closely, feeling he’d seen it somewhere before.

Soon, he remembered.

He had indeed seen this hammer, not in reality, but in the Sea of Consciousness of Jiang Chuhe, the Eldest Young Master of the Jiang Family.

Last time, when Demonic Qi besieged the city, Jiang Chuhe was corrupted and became a demon. Yang Kai and Qin Yu joined forces to search his soul for a way to counter the demonic calamity, and in Jiang Chuhe’s Sea of Consciousness, Yang Kai saw many things about the Ancient Giant Demon.

Among those scenes, traces of this hammer appeared.

In those battles, the Ancient Giant Demon wielded this warhammer, sweeping all before him. Countless ancient experts died under its blows, ending their glorious lives.

“Demonic Warhammer!” Yang Kai shouted, quickly dispersing the World-Ending Demon Eye, not daring to look further.

If this was truly the Ancient Giant Demon’s Demonic Warhammer, then everything made sense—why the demonic intent sealed in his body resonated with the shadow. The two were inherently connected, so their resonance was natural.

So, in ancient times, those experts sealed not only the Ancient Giant Demon’s black pupil here, but also his Demonic Warhammer!

The warhammer had been suppressed beneath the Eighteen Star Array, never seeing daylight, and now it had finally broken free.

Perhaps it was related to the Source Crystal mine he’d collected. That mine might have been the key to suppressing the warhammer!

Though he had such suspicions, Yang Kai felt no regret in his heart.
