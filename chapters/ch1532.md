## Chapter 1532 — Expanding the Small Xuan Realm

Resolute in his mind, Yang Kai rose, stretched out his hand and waved it forward; the Spatial Force surged and a narrow spatial rift immediately appeared before him.

But compared to the rifts he normally tore open, this one seemed a little smaller.

The heaven-and-earth laws inside this Xuan Realm Pearl seemed extraordinarily powerful!

Yang Kai's face flickered with a strange expression, but he did not pry further; he thrust out both hands and ripped the spatial rift savagely to either side. Spatial Force in his body erupted wildly, and without a sound the narrow fissure was widened.

Releasing his Divine Sense to probe for a moment, Yang Kai joyfully discovered that the spatial rift was astonishingly stable.

Was that old coot Qi Tianche really spouting nonsense? Yang Kai wondered suspiciously, then dove headfirst into the spatial rift.

When he reappeared and took in his surroundings, his face darkened.

Within a small space less than thirty zhang across, chaos reigned — the place was strewn with the traces of a great battle; two mutilated corpses lay on the ground, blood and entrails everywhere...

Emerging from the spatial rift, it was still this eerie Small Xuan Realm!

He frowned and stubbornly tore the space once more.

...

After repeating it a dozen or so times, Yang Kai stopped and sat cross-legged on the ground, sinking into thought.

Even after more than a dozen attempts to tear open space, he could not leave this Small Xuan Realm; he could only move within that thirty zhang radius, and the result surprised him.

It seemed Qi Tianche had not been entirely talking nonsense — this Xuan Realm Pearl truly had its mysteries; even by tearing space could not escape it.

Although he had not succeeded in leaving, Yang Kai was not without gain. Those repeated actions made him vaguely sense that around the outskirts of this small space there was a faint barrier that severed his connection to the outside world.

This layer of barrier was indescribable, yet because it existed the Small Xuan Realm could form its own world, imprisoning him here.

That must be the Small Xuan Realm's heaven-and-earth law!

If he could tear through that barrier, Yang Kai would have confidence he could leave.

But to break the Small Xuan Realm's heaven-and-earth law — how easy would that be? Qi Tianche had spent decades to refine the Xuan Realm Pearl and had only grasped a little of the power controlling this patch of heaven-and-earth, allowing him to come and go freely.

He did not have so much time to squander here.

Yet now, aside from refining the Xuan Realm Pearl itself, there was no other method.

How to refine the Xuan Realm Pearl? To refine it was to refine this very piece of heaven-and-earth. Yang Kai felt baffled — he had the sensation of a dog trying to bite a hedgehog with nowhere to latch on.

He sat motionless and pondered bitterly.

He did not know how long had passed. Suddenly a faint light blossomed in Yang Kai's bewildered eyes; that glint was like a star-fire that could kindle a prairie blaze, and it quickly cleared his vision.

He seemed to understand something, his spirit jolting as he brightened with energy.

Previously he had fallen into a mistaken train of thought, believing that to leave he must refine this heaven-and-earth, and thus he had been at a loss.

But ultimately, this heaven-and-earth was sealed inside the Xuan Realm Pearl; the Xuan Realm Pearl was an Imperial Treasure — in other words, a Secret Treasure!

He did not know how to refine a heaven-and-earth, but refining a Secret Treasure was something he was well-practiced in.

And since Qi Tianche had spent decades in seclusion refining the Xuan Realm Pearl, this Imperial Treasure must have been imbued with his aura; if he could trace and erase the remnants of that aura and then perform the ritual refining anew, it would suffice.

One method opens all methods — Yang Kai suddenly had an epiphany.

He sprang up, produced two Demonic Flames and burned the nearby corpses clean. Only then did he release his Divine Sense and begin probing inch by inch through the thirty zhang space, trying to find the traces he wanted.

The result was smooth; he indeed found remnants of Qi Tianche's aura within the space.

With little effort he erased them.

But when Yang Kai attempted to leave his own aura there, he encountered tremendous resistance.

Qi Tianche had not been entirely wrong — to refine the Xuan Realm Pearl from the inside was overwhelmingly difficult, far harder than refining it from the outside; the time and energy required differed by hundreds to thousands of times.

Even though Yang Kai's attainments in Spatial Force far outstripped Qi Tianche's, such internal refinement was not something that could be finished in a short time.

Yang Kai did a quick calculation, and the result startled him.

It would take at least ten to twenty years of effort before he could barely refine the Xuan Realm Pearl and escape.

He suddenly regretted having killed Fang Peng so quickly.

If Fang Peng were alive now, he could at least beat him up and vent.

After frowning and pondering for a long time, Yang Kai calmed his agitation. Rather than immediately refining the Xuan Realm Pearl, he emptied a heap of crystal stones from his Spatial Ring before him, grasped one in each hand and wildly absorbed their energy.

Ethereal Crystals!

Yang Kai's profound comprehension of Spatial Force — which allowed him to surpass Mo Xiaosheng and Qi Tianche in this domain — was owed to the Ethereal Crystals.

These odd crystals had always been used merely as materials for forging Spatial Rings, but Yang Kai took a different route, absorbing their energy into himself to strengthen his control of Spatial Force.

Ethereal Crystals were exceedingly rare; even if others had the idea, it would be extremely difficult to accomplish.

But Yang Kai was different — the Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao had once found a vein of Ethereal Crystals beneath Dragon Lair Mountain, giving him the capital to spend lavishly without worry.

A considerable quantity had been mined back then, but over the years whenever Yang Kai had free time he would absorb the crystals' power, consuming vast amounts; now only about half of the originally mined remained.

To do a job well, one must first sharpen one's tools.

If Yang Kai wanted to shorten the time needed to refine the Xuan Realm Pearl, he had to deepen his insight into Spatial Force and handle it more deftly.

So he planned to cultivate his Spatial Force for a while.

Piece by piece the Ethereal Crystals turned to powder in Yang Kai's hands; outside, days and months passed, yet inside the Small Xuan Realm no passage of time could be perceived.

He did not know how long it lasted, but a thick layer of Ethereal Crystals powder had accumulated around him, almost burying him.

Long-term absorption of the Ethereal Crystals's power, combined with his own insights, made Yang Kai feel he had deepened his attainments in Spatial Force another degree, but he also found that as his mastery improved, absorbing the crystals' energy contributed less and less to his growth.

Perhaps one day, no matter how much he absorbed, he would no longer advance.

Yang Kai paused temporarily, then once more released his Divine Sense to refine this small heaven-and-earth.

After a moment he raised an eyebrow and a look of delight appeared on his face.

The refining process was indeed much easier than at first. Moreover, he could clearly sense the separation and restraints between this heaven-and-earth and the outside world.

Once those were broken, he would be able to leave.

Spatial Force fused into his Divine Sense and, centered on Yang Kai, spread outward like a tide.

He sought to leave his life imprint upon this heaven-and-earth, to carve his soul's mark into it and make it his own.

To his astonishment, as his Divine Sense spread outward, the small heaven-and-earth that had originally covered only around thirty zhang suddenly expanded a little, and sights he had not seen before came into view.

The result greatly surprised Yang Kai.

But upon reflection he understood.

Although Qi Tianche had slightly refined the Xuan Realm Pearl and could come and go, his grasp of Spatial Force was shallow, so he could only open that roughly thirty zhang space.

Yang Kai was different; his attainments in Spatial Force were far deeper than that old man's, so he could expand more space.

Suddenly Yang Kai grew curious.

He wanted to know what the Small Xuan Realm would look like when fully opened, and how vast its area might be.

His original intent to refine the Xuan Realm Pearl and escape quietly shifted; Yang Kai was filled with energy and delight, and began an exploratory process.

He frantically urged his Divine Sense, mobilizing his mastery of Spatial Force; the Small Xuan Realm's heaven-and-earth seemed like primordial chaos opening, gradually expanding outward and revealing previously unseen scenery and enchanting sights.

In the process he found wondrous insights and subtle powers pouring into his heart, integrating into the depths of his soul, making his understanding of Spatial Force ever clearer — far more effective than absorbing the Ethereal Crystals's energy a thousandfold.

Expanding the Small Xuan Realm's heaven-and-earth and cultivating Spatial Force thus formed a virtuous cycle from his inadvertent actions.

Yang Kai was overjoyed and pursued it with tireless zeal.

Inside the Small Xuan Realm the heaven-and-earth expanded day by day, and Yang Kai grew day by day.

With his cultivation, the bottleneck at the peak of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm was naturally broken through, and Yang Kai advanced to the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm within the Small Xuan Realm.

After all, in the Fallen Emperor Mountains he had already reached the peak of the First Stage of the Origin Returning Realm; if he had not deliberately suppressed himself, he could have broken through at that time.

He still did not cease his explorations and constantly repeated the same actions.

His strength had grown, his Saint Yuan became purer, and his Divine Sense surged wildly—Yang Kai had achieved an all-around breakthrough!

Even the Soul Incarnation fragment grew and was nourished.

Growing tired, he rested briefly; with no one to stave off boredom, he released the Stone Puppet and spoke with it for a while.

The Stone Puppet Xiaoxiao remained fascinated by the second Golden Stone Puppet; although that Golden Stone Puppet's intellect was damaged and it could only act under Yang Kai's Soul Incarnation's control, it was after all Xiaoxiao's only kin.

It prized the Golden Stone Puppet highly and shared any good things with it.

Time passed little by little.

Yang Kai did not know how long he had stayed in the Small Xuan Realm, but he had exhausted all the Ethereal Crystals and had expanded this small heaven-and-earth from the original thirty zhang to a radius of one hundred li, with new progress every day.

Within that hundred-li range there were mountains and waters, and the scenery was exceptionally beautiful.

But this was far from the end of the Small Xuan Realm; beyond the unknown lay even more tantalizing secrets.

One day Yang Kai stood up, expanded his Divine Sense outward, and in an instant every blade of grass and tree within the hundred li was probed.

He grinned, pointed ahead with a finger, and a vortex suddenly appeared, spinning and emanating a tremendous suction.

Yang Kai did not resist, letting the vortex suck him in; the next moment he vanished.
