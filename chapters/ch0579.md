## Chapter 579 — Could It Be Here for Revenge?

North and south, unable to see each other; the world’s number one city.

This phrase was originally used to praise the grandeur of Zhongdu, but with the large-scale invasion of Cangyun Evil Land, this honorific phrase had become a reality.

Truly, north and south unable to see each other...

To the north of Zhongdu lay the encroaching threat of Cangyun Evil Land. To the south, the Eight Great Families, with Yang Family at their core, defended and counterattacked, attempting to repel Yang Bai and the five Evil Kings.

The battle had lasted for half a year, the situation deadlocked.

Among the elite, Cangyun Evil Land boasted an absolute advantage with Yang Bai at the Transcendent Realm, Third Stage.

However, in sheer numbers of experts, the Eight Great Families held a vast lead. Even though many Transcendent Realm warriors had died these past six months, the gap remained large.

Neither side could take the upper hand; they stood face to face, neither willing to abandon Zhongdu.

Small skirmishes every three days, large battles every five—such was the daily routine for warriors from the Eight Great Families and Cangyun Evil Land. Over time, both sides had come to understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses.

At this very moment, fierce combat raged along the north-south dividing line of Zhongdu.

Warriors kept falling, yet reinforcements poured in ceaselessly, the situation growing ever more intense.

Fortunately, both sides exercised some restraint; those engaged were only Divine Roaming Realm experts. The Transcendent Realm strong ones stayed back to command and coordinate.

Even for the Transcendent Realm warriors, the prolonged stalemate had taken its toll; none could afford to recklessly fight on the frontlines at all times.

From Cangyun Evil Land’s side, the five Evil Kings coldly observed the savage battle. Ghost King and Poison King grinned eerily, seemingly delighted by the bloodshed and indifferent to their subordinates’ lives, continuously sending more to the front to boost morale.

On the side of the Eight Great Families, Ye Kuangren, Kang Rui, Gao Mo, and Meng Xiping all glared with bloodshot eyes, their expressions showing utter hatred for Cangyun Evil Land. They poured their clan’s elite forces into the battle, determined to decisively defeat their foes.

These four were the current heads of their clans—Ye Family, Kang Family, Gao Family, and Meng Family.

Half a year ago, Cangyun Evil Land’s first target was War City.

Gao Rangfeng of the Gao Family was brutally slain by Ghost King and Poison King’s forces. Ye Xinrou of the Ye Family and Kang Zhan of the Kang Family were captured alive and remained imprisoned by Cangyun Evil Land, tortured beyond life itself.

Only Meng Shanyi of the Meng Family was lucky, clever enough to disguise himself as a mere Outer Disciple and escape. However, due to exposure to venom and ghostly energy, he became a crippled wreck. After Meng Family masters brought him back to Zhongdu, they had been using their clan’s heaven-and-earth treasure to sustain and heal him, but with little improvement.

The heirs of these four families—either dead, crippled, or imprisoned—their fathers, the four family heads, naturally bore deep anger. Over the past six months, these four clans had been the most aggressive and warlike among the Eight Great Families.

Today’s battle was led by them, the main force of the Eight Great Families, pressing hard against Cangyun Evil Land.

Suddenly, both sides at the battlefield sensed a terrifying aura rapidly approaching from the horizon.

Noticing this aura, everyone involuntarily paused, withdrawing slightly and gazing into the distance.

A small black dot appeared in their vision, too distant to discern immediately.

After a while, as a faint outline became visible, all were stunned.

It was a dwelling!

A mansion, suspended midair, flying quickly toward them like a mobile fortress, exuding overwhelming momentum.

The mansion was enveloped by a palace-shaped barrier, radiating splendid light and solemn majesty, with bright flowing patterns. Powerful energy fluctuations emanated from within.

“What is that?” Yinming Ghost King stared, puzzled.

Warriors at the True Yuan Realm could fly, but he’d never heard of a mansion flying.

“Ghost King, don’t you find the outer barrier somewhat familiar?” Destruction Poison King’s emerald eyes flickered like ghostly flames, his expression thoughtful.

Hearing this, Ghost King pondered, then shuddered: “You mean...?”

“Almost so. It came from that direction.”

“That thing can fly?” Ghost King cried out, even he, a seasoned figure, found this hard to accept.

“That is a mysterious secret treasure; it must have qualities we don’t understand. It’s only natural,” Shadow King suddenly interjected.

“What about that enchantress? Didn’t our lord have her watch that area? Such a great incident occurred, yet no report?” Heaven-Dominating Force King thundered across Zhongdu.

“Heh, she’s not on our side,” Poison King chuckled darkly, meaning evident in his words.

“I knew it,” Thunder Beast King snorted coldly, “One day I’ll make that bitch submit beneath me!”

The Five Evil Kings gestured and debated over the massive flying mansion, while the Eight Great Families puzzled over it as well.

None knew the situation at War City; Yang Kai’s mansion suddenly arriving made them nervous, fearing it could be Cangyun Evil Land’s reinforcements.

Only Yang Yinghao bore a grave expression as he watched the moving fortress.

He had long known from Fourth Master Yang that Yang Kai’s mansion was safe. Though mysterious how Yang Kai had secured this, Yang Yinghao inexplicably believed Yang Kai had the ability.

Now seeing this, all his doubts cleared.

Soon, Yang Kai’s mansion arrived over Zhongdu, and many figures standing before it came into view.

Recognizing them, the Eight Great Families exploded with cries.

“It’s Yang Kai! The youngest young master of the Yang Family!”

“He actually survived? Wasn’t War City supposed to be wiped out without survivors?”

“What’s up with this mansion? How can it fly?”

“He brought many people with him.”

Yang Kai stood at the edge of the mansion, looking down over Zhongdu from above. Behind him were thirteen Yang Family Blood Servants who had reached the Transcendent Realm, aligned as stars around a moon, highlighting him upfront.

Behind them stood four Transcendent Realm cultivators: Di Mo, Ling Taixu, Lü Si, and Li Yuanchun.

Following them were countless Divine Roaming Realm experts.

Beside Yang Yinghao, Blood Servants Hall Leader Feng Sheng eyed the thirteen Blood Servants who had fought in the Succession War, frowning slightly as he quietly said to Deputy Hall Leader Zhou Feng, “Do you feel the aura of Tu Feng, Yu Xian and the others... is a bit different from before?”

“They are said to have reached Divine Roaming Realm, Ninth Stage; likely due to their promotion,” Zhou Feng answered with mild puzzlement.

“No!” Feng Sheng shook his head, “Their aura puts me under great pressure. This isn’t something mere Divine Roaming Realm, Ninth Stage could produce.”

Feng Sheng, as Hall Leader of the Blood Servants Hall, was naturally a top-tier Divine Roaming Realm expert. If those people only had the level of Divine Roaming Realm, Ninth Stage, he shouldn’t feel pressure.

Yang Kai’s mansion was wrapped in the Heavenly Journey Palace’s barrier, cutting off all Divine Sense reconnaissance. Feng Sheng had no idea about Tu Feng and the others’ actual cultivation but had an uneasy feeling.

Could they have surpassed the Divine Roaming Realm, Ninth Stage? Usually calm, Feng Sheng was startled by this thought, but quickly dismissed it as unlikely.

“Brother Yang, what does this mean?” Meng Xiping and others quickly asked Yang Yinghao, hoping for an answer.

“If you want to know, go ask him yourself,” Yang Yinghao replied calmly. He did not know why Yang Kai had suddenly come to War City.

“Could it be for revenge?” Ye Kuangren voiced the thought.

Hearing this, the family heads of the Eight Great Families all looked grim.

It was not impossible. Half a year ago, the Eight Great Families had employed countless methods to deal with Yang Kai; he was just a young man under twenty, impetuous and rash. Harboring grudges and seeking revenge was only natural.

If he took advantage of the current chaos and allied with Cangyun Evil Land…

“If he dares to do so, I’ll make him wish he were dead!” Gao Mo snorted coldly.

Kang Rui said, “Brother Yang, he is still your Yang Family, you have to deal with this.”

“How could I? When the other seven families attacked him, the Yang Family stayed out of it. If he really seeks revenge, then the Yang Family will be next.”

“You are all worrying over nothing,” Meng Xiping sneered, “Though Yang Kai commands many powerful experts, what can he really do? If he truly seeks revenge against the Eight Great Families, he'll be courting death! Besides, aren’t his parents still in the Yang Family?”

Yang Yinghao suddenly turned, staring at Meng Xiping with eyes full of warning: “Don’t lay a hand on his parents. If you enrage him, he will do anything.”

Meng Xiping secretly shook his head, thinking Yang Yinghao was overreacting. A mere young disciple of the Yang Family—did he really need such serious caution?

By then, Yang Kai’s mansion had arrived and slowly descended into the heart of Zhongdu.

After a thunderous crash, the mansion that had been a hundred li away in War City once again settled in Zhongdu.

Meng Wuya panted heavily, cold sweat pouring down, near exhaustion.

Driving the Heavenly Journey Palace, a peerless secret treasure, with Divine Roaming Realm top-tier power consumed him greatly. Luckily it was only a hundred li flight—any further and he wouldn’t have endured.

“Shopkeeper Meng, you’ve worked hard,” Yang Kai said solemnly.

Meng Wuya responded with a nod and immediately began recovering.

The mansion landed with the Eight Great Families to the front and Cangyun Evil Land to the rear, like a sharp blade cleaving straight between the two camps without the slightest hesitation.

Such arrogance not only showed Yang Kai’s disregard for both warring sides but also made his stance clear—he would not accommodate or side with either.

“Interesting,” several Evil Kings chuckled, watching Yang Kai at the crowd’s forefront with amusement.

“Arrogant!” The family heads of the Eight Great Families snorted in unison, their hostility toward Yang Kai growing.
