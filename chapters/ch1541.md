## Chapter 1541 — Everything As Before

"Fei'er!" The old man was startled and hastily shot her a glare.

The girl couldn't help but pout.

Yang Kai chuckled, nodded, and said, "Yes, I am the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect — there's nothing to pretend about, is there?"

"I'm just asking." The girl stuck out her tongue, then, as if having made a great decision, bit her red lip and said, "You're the Sect Master of Lingxiao Sect, so your words should carry weight, right?"

"They should be effective!"

"Then can you accept me into Lingxiao Sect?"

At those words, the old man turned pale and immediately began apologizing fervently.

He knew full well that Lingxiao Sect never took in people.

Even experts like Liang Yong were merely lords of Battle Sky City and had not truly become people of Lingxiao Sect; his family's Fei'er has only just entered the Saint Realm — what merit or ability could she possibly have to be accepted into such a sect?

Though he apologized in panic, the old man could not help but feel a flicker of hope.

If Fei'er could truly be accepted into Lingxiao Sect, her prospects would be boundless! Now on Dark Star, Lingxiao Sect stood supreme; no sect could contend with it. To enter such a sect would be nothing short of fortunate.

Yang Kai stopped the old man's ceaseless fussing, looked at the girl at leisure, and asked, "You want to join Lingxiao Sect?"

The girl nodded.

"Why?" Yang Kai asked.

"It's nice to take shelter under a great tree!" the girl answered without a second thought.

The old man's face twitched at the reply. Yang Kai was silent for a moment, then burst into loud laughter.

"If I become a disciple of Lingxiao Sect, no one will dare bully our family's disciples anymore," the girl added, her cheeks flushed.

Yang Kai laughed even more heartily. “Good! You may have your own motives, but at least you’re straightforward about it. Since you’re so eager to join the Lingxiao Sect, this Sect Master will take you in.”

"Ah?" The girl's expression froze — she had not expected happiness to arrive so suddenly; she had presumed she would be refused and had already braced herself.

"You silly girl, aren't you going to thank the Sect Master for this great favor!" the old man quickly mouthed, throwing a prompting look.

Only then did the girl come to her senses; she hurriedly knelt and performed deep bows in full ceremony.

The young people who had come with her looked on with envy.

"All right, rise. I'll give you one day to settle your family matters. In one day I will set off to return to the Sect. Then you will come with me," Yang Kai said, waving his hand.

"Yes!" the girl bit her lip, her face flushed, and she replied excitedly.

There was no need for Yang Kai to fuss over Bibo City, nor did Battle Sky City need him to handle things. One day later, Yang Kai took the green-clothed girl through Bibo City's Space Array, transmitting directly to Battle Sky City, and from Battle Sky City's array they proceeded to Demon Blood City!

Demon Blood City had now been renamed Lingxiao City.

It served as the bridge linking the reclusive Lingxiao Sect, resident in Flowing Flame Sandland, to the outside world, and was a city directly governed by Lingxiao Sect.

A few years ago, during the Imperial Garden incident, the Demon Blood Sect's Great Elder and that beautiful Sect Master were both killed by Yang Kai, which led to ceaseless infighting within the Demon Blood Sect; countless deaths among its upper ranks left the sect near collapse after several years.

Ye Xijun seized the situation, led people to occupy the Demon Blood City nearest the Sect, and renamed it Lingxiao City.

Needless to say, with the Demon Blood Sect now in decline and unwilling to resist, even at its height it would not have dared resist given Lingxiao Sect's strength — the Demon Blood Sect would not have dared to oppose them.

Demon Blood City thus fell easily into their hands and became an asset of Lingxiao Sect.

All supplies and traveling martial artists transited through Lingxiao City; although Lingxiao Sect still lay within Flowing Flame Sandland, its contact with the outside world had become far more convenient.

The moment Yang Kai appeared atop the Space Array, a thunderous shout roared beside his ear.

"We respectfully welcome the Sect Master back to the Sect!"

The coordinated voices startled Fei'er, and the flustered green-clothed girl hurriedly hid behind Yang Kai.

Yang Kai swept his gaze about and suddenly discovered that almost all of Lingxiao Sect's high-ranking members were present, led by Great Elder Ye Xijun.

They had obviously heard the news and were waiting here.

Seeing Yang Kai not missing an arm or a leg and completely unscathed, Ye Xijun could not help but breathe a sigh of relief.

After the battle at Lingjue Peak, Yang Kai, Qi Tianche, and Fang Peng had suddenly vanished — that disappearance lasted three years. The entire Lingxiao Sect worried over Yang Kai, and parties from all directions probed for news, but to no avail.

Yang Kai had seemed to vanish from this cultivation star as if into thin air!

Now that he had finally returned safely, Ye Xijun was, of course, pleased.

At a glance her beautiful eyes narrowed — she discovered that Yang Kai's cultivation had already reached the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm! Even Ye Xijun, steady of temperament and seasoned by countless storms, could not help but be repeatedly shocked by this discovery.

In just a few years he had advanced another step within the Origin Returning Realm — isn't the Sect Master's speed of cultivation somewhat astonishing?

"Great Elder, you've worked hard!" Yang Kai nodded lightly to Ye Xijun. "And you all have worked hard as well."

"Sect Master, you flatter us; we haven't worked hard — it is you who have borne the burden these years," Ye Xijun said with a smile, her eyes sweeping over Fei'er before she looked at Yang Kai with curiosity, wondering why he had brought a girl of the Saint King Realm.

"This girl wishes to join Lingxiao Sect, and this Sect Master has decided to accept her," Yang Kai explained casually.

"I see," Ye Xijun nodded.

"Come, stop hiding; first pay respects to the elders," Yang Kai said, pulling Fei'er out from behind him.

The green-clothed girl's face flushed; she swept her gaze across the assembled and her eyes shone with worship and reverence.

These were the most powerful figures of the strongest sect on Dark Star! Any one of them stomping a foot could probably make Dark Star tremble three times.

She had never seen such an imposing display!

Gathering her wits and steadying her spirit, she hastily bowed to pay her respects.

"No need for such formality. Since the Sect Master has admitted you, from now on you are a disciple of our Lingxiao Sect; train diligently within the Sect, and if you perform well enough, it is not impossible to become a disciple under one of the people before you," Ye Xijun said kindly.

"Yes!" Fei'er nodded excitedly.

"Go back for now and we'll talk later," Yang Kai motioned.

Half a day later, at Lingxiao Sect's main headquarters in the council hall, the elders gathered to report to Yang Kai on the Sect's developments over the past three years.

It was best described as meteoric advancement.

Not to mention other matters, merely the addition of over two hundred martial artists from Star Emperor Mountain had catapulted Lingxiao Sect's overall strength to first place on Dark Star! This was indisputable; no sect could compare with the present Lingxiao Sect.

Beyond that, led by Battle Sky City, the subordinate cities produced large annual revenues; Lingxiao Sect no longer needed to worry about supplies for cultivation.

The sect's numbers had never been large, but supplies flowed in continually from all directions. Lingxiao Sect now had three great storerooms, each piled to the brim, yet they were still not enough; Ye Xijun planned to open more.

They had also gained two great allies in Qiantian Sect and Yingyue Hall.

These two powers had long been on good terms with Yang Kai. During his three-year disappearance, both had provided significant help to Lingxiao Sect's development. Thus Ye Xijun decided to form alliances with them.

By joining forces, both sides could benefit one another and share what each lacked.

Countless powers wished to ally with Lingxiao Sect but had no way to make contact; they could only envy the opportunities enjoyed by Yingyue Hall and Qiantian Sect.

Yang Kai listened for a while and nodded in satisfaction.

Lingxiao Sect's development had now entered the right track. When he founded the sect back then, he could never have imagined it would reach today's scale and stature.

Back then he had merely come to settle here with Wu Yi and others aboard a warship.

It could be said that the downfall of Battle Sky Alliance, Leitai Sect, and Star Emperor Mountain provided unimaginable assistance to Lingxiao Sect's rapid rise; without the demise of those three powers, there would absolutely not be today's Lingxiao Sect.

They had all become stepping stones that raised Lingxiao City's name.

Half a day later, after the elders dispersed, Yang Kai remained with Ye Xijun.

The Great Elder, knowing Yang Kai surely had other matters to ask, spoke before Yang Kai could: "If the Sect Master wishes to inquire about the Lord's condition, I can only say that everything is as before!"

"Everything as before..." Yang Kai murmured.

"Yes, Sect Master, do not worry. Since the Lord said that sleeping for ten to twenty years would suffice, we only need to wait patiently."

"That is true." Yang Kai nodded and asked no further questions.

"Additionally, the Sect Master's Artifact Spirit is now recuperating in the Earth Lung Fire Vein of the Fifth Layer; that verdant long sword has been brought back as well and is placed in the Sect Master's Tianyi Palace," the Great Elder reported.

"I understand."

In truth there was no need for Ye Xijun to say more — as soon as Yang Kai returned to Flowing Flame Sandland he sensed the locations of these two great aids; after all, whether the Fire Bird or the Dragon Bone Sword, both were linked to his mind.

When Qi Tianche used the Xuan Realm Pearl to drag him into a Small Xuan Realm back then, the Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade had remained outside, and later in battle the Fire Bird's Artifact Spirit had been banished, leaving only the Stone Puppet by Yang Kai's side.

Ye Xijun would, of course, bring them back.

"Back then... what exactly happened? Did the Sect Master's sudden disappearance have something to do with that Imperial Treasure?" Ye Xijun pondered and asked with a grave expression.

She only knew the Xuan Realm Pearl was an Imperial Treasure, but she had no idea what powers the pearl truly possessed.

Star Emperor Mountain had never in its generations been able to refine it; regarding the pearl's powers, Ye Xijun was utterly at a loss.

"Yes, Qi Tianche dragged me into a Small Xuan Realm," Yang Kai replied.

"Small Xuan Realm..." Ye Xijun's eyes narrowed.

"Fortunately, after spending three years, I finally escaped; Great Elder need not worry too much."

Seeing he had no intention of speaking further, Ye Xijun naturally did not press the matter.

After a moment's thought she took out an object and handed it to Yang Kai. "The Lord sent me a message during her slumber, telling me to give you this and asking you to keep it safe."

"The Star Emperor Token!" Yang Kai exclaimed softly as he looked upon what Ye Xijun handed him.

He reached out, took it, and caressed the Star Emperor Token; Yang Kai's face was heavy with gravity.

He already had as many as four of these tokens: the first had been given to him by Ghost Ancestor and contained a seal of the Great Emperor's divine art; the second was found in a pavilion on the Sixth Stage of Flowing Flame Sandland; the third was brought by Ge Qi; and this fourth piece was the one now before him.
