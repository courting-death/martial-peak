## Chapter 1116 — Stone Race

Yang Kai waited outside for a while, turning over in his mind how to smooth over the awkwardness between him and Yang Yan.

He was a man with thick skin who could shrug that sort of thing off with a laugh, but Yang Yan was different — she looked like an inexperienced woman, possibly never having been so intimate with a man.

Unlike Xue Yue, who could remain calm even when naked and being held and still bargain for a sliver of hope, they were two women of very different temperaments.

What if, because of this, Yang Yan felt too embarrassed to see him again, or flew into a shame-fueled rage and ran off?

Losing materials was no loss to Yang Kai, he didn’t mind, but Yang Yan could not be lost — she was a talent. He had only recently arrived on Dark Star and knew few people; if he truly wanted to use this place as a springboard to make his name spread throughout the Star Domain, force alone wouldn’t be enough — he had to gather rare talents as his reserve.

Should he apologize and say some sweet words? Yang Kai hesitated. Yang Yan was pure; a few sweet words would likely let her set aside her grievance, but he feared she might misunderstand and he’d end up hurting her feelings.

What a worry! Yang Kai scratched his head.

Just as he was torn, Yang Yan, having washed herself and dressed in a black robe, suddenly ran out of the cave and flew straight toward them.

"Yang Kai! Yang Kai... come with me!" Yang Yan's face flickered with an indescribable expression, seeming both excited and nervous. She rushed to Yang Kai, grabbed his hand, and dragged him into the cave in haste.

"What’s the matter?" Yang Kai was astonished; he hadn’t expected Yang Yan to leave the earlier incident unmentioned — it was surprising. He had even thought she might hide in the cave for days and avoid him.

"I think I found something; come take a look." She couldn’t explain it, and kept pulling Yang Kai into the cave until they reached the spot from before. Pointing at the small hole in the ground, she asked, "Did you see anything here just now? Did you clearly see what startled me?"

Seeing her widen her beautiful eyes and probe the little hole with her Divine Sense as if determined to learn what lay within, Yang Kai’s heart stirred: "Do you recognize it?"

If Yang Yan didn’t recognize it, she wouldn’t be reacting this way.

"I might recognize it!" Yang Yan nodded. "But it might not be what I think. Can you trace the creature’s position through this little hole? If you can catch it I can study it properly."

"What do you think it is?" Yang Kai asked hurriedly.

Yang Yan shook her head, brow knitting slightly. "I can’t be certain until I see it clearly. I only caught a glimpse just now; after thinking it over I only feel it resembles something. Can you track it?"

"No need to track it."

"Don’t!" Yang Yan misread his meaning, grabbed his arm and shook it, pleading, "Please track it for me, I’m really curious. If you can track it for me I... I..." Her face flushed as if remembering something embarrassing; after a long pause she bit her lip and said, "I won’t pursue what happened just now!"

"I wasn’t to blame for what happened earlier, right?" Yang Kai said awkwardly, thinking women truly were sometimes unreasonable.

Yang Yan pouted; although she knew Yang Kai wasn’t at fault — she had jumped into his arms and clung to him — she still felt she’d been taken advantage of, and the thought made her feel aggrieved.

"Just help me this once, I helped you with your forging..." Yang Yan could only continue to beg.

"No tracking needed," Yang Kai shook his head. "I’ll just call it over."

"Call... call it over?" Yang Yan was stunned, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment, not understanding his meaning.

After a moment, the rustling sound came again from beneath the ground. This time Yang Yan seemed bolder, or rather eager; she widened her eyes and stared at the spot the sound came from without blinking.

Suddenly another small hole appeared in the ground, and that gray, slightly square head cautiously poked out.

Yang Yan’s expression grew more excited, her breath suddenly quickening.

The little stone creature seemed somewhat afraid of Yang Yan, who had just slapped it hard; though its intelligence was extremely low and it acted on instinct, it still remembered who had struck it.

Seeing that face before it, the little stone being immediately crawled out of the hole with startling agility, sprinted to Yang Kai’s feet, clambered up his clothes and scrambled upward.

Yang Yan watched in a daze, her gaze following the little stone until it reached Yang Kai’s shoulder and hid behind him, at which point she suddenly screamed.

"Stone Race!"

Yang Kai noticed her face had twisted; he couldn’t tell whether it was excitement or something else.

Having cried out, Yang Yan seemed to realize it was inappropriate and quickly covered her mouth, sending her Divine Sense to probe with extreme caution.

"Stone Race?" Yang Kai frowned, taking the little fellow from his shoulder and placing it in his palm. "Do you know it?"

Yang Yan looked up at Yang Kai and nodded repeatedly, then suddenly realized: "This Stone Race being is yours?"

If it didn’t belong to Yang Kai, how could he have caught it so easily? And how could he command it to come over on its own?
Yang Yan suddenly felt a bit dizzy. She realized she had once again underestimated Yang Kai’s foundations—he possessed so many precious materials, so many high-grade Secret Treasures, could fight across realms and easily slay Saint King Realm cultivators, and now even owned a Stone Race being, such a heaven-defying existence. Just what kind of monster was this man?

But why hadn’t she seen this Stone Race before?

"It’s mine. Tell me, what is a Stone Race?" Yang Kai was intrigued; he had been researching the little stone being’s secret these days with no results, and hadn’t expected Yang Yan to recognize it.

"Can I take a closer look? I’m still not certain!" Yang Yan looked at the little creature expectantly.

Yang Kai nodded and tossed it to her; Yang Yan’s character was trustworthy, and he also wanted her to help solve the mystery.

Yang Yan took it in both hands and glared at Yang Kai fiercely, as if reproaching him for his rudeness.

Then she suddenly switched to a gentle expression, holding the little stone being up to her face and sizing it up.

Facing the woman who had inexplicably slapped it, the little stone being seemed fearful and attempted several times to return to Yang Kai; Yang Kai had to issue a command to calm it.

"It’s a Blood Essence Stone, no doubt; this really is a Stone Race being. My heavens — wasn’t this species supposed to have been wiped out? Yet one survives in the world." Yang Yan observed for a while, murmuring excitedly and clutching the little being tightly, unwilling to let go.

Yang Kai’s face darkened as he took the little fellow back from her hands.

"I haven’t finished looking; let me see it again!" Yang Yan no longer cared about the earlier embarrassment — her whole attention was drawn to the little creature, which exerted an irresistible attraction.

"Since you know it, explain clearly; after you tell me, you can study it however you like." Yang Kai waited for her answer.

"You own it and don’t know what it is?" Yang Yan looked at Yang Kai in astonishment.

"Why should I need to know?" Yang Kai said coolly.

Yang Yan’s mouth twitched, torn between crying and laughing. After a moment she gritted her teeth: "Heaven is truly unfair — why can you possess such a thing? Why isn’t it mine?"

After venting, she began to explain: "It’s a Stone Race!"

"You already told me that. Is Stone Race a species?" Yang Kai asked.

"Yes." Yang Yan nodded angrily. "They’re also called stone puppets. Since you own one, you should know their intelligence is extremely low — almost nonexistent. Their actions rely entirely on instinct and the orders given by whoever tames them; so although they are a form of life and could be called a species, they are still puppets!"

Yang Kai lightly nodded, aware that Yang Yan was right; his own research over recent days had yielded identical conclusions.

"They only appear under very special conditions. Their initial form is a pitch-black round stone; they are sealed within the round stone with no life fluctuations, but once they absorb enough mineral essence they slowly mature until fully grown. You can picture them as being hatched, but not exactly the same."

"And for them to break out of their shell, one thing is required — a Blood Essence Stone! The Blood Essence Stone is the heart of a Stone Race creature; without a Blood Essence Stone, no matter how healthily it grows, it cannot truly come to life. This little one has a Blood Essence Stone at its chest, so I can be certain it is one of the Stone Race!"

Sure enough, just as he had guessed, the Blood Essence Stone was the little creature’s heart!

"Stone Race beings are extremely few in number, but the roles they can play are beyond imagination. Long ago, whenever a Stone Race appeared, countless people would pursue it, hoping to pocket it and turn it into their stone puppet!"

"What role?" Yang Kai asked quickly.

Yang Yan chuckled: "Their growth depends on absorbing vast quantities of mineral essence, so they are highly sensitive to rare minerals. Any good deposit nearby they will detect first. Imagine the usefulness — owning a stone puppet gives you access to all unknown veins; even Void King Realm cultivators cannot hide mines from their detection."

Yang Kai’s eyes brightened as he looked at the little creature, realizing it was not useless after all; though simple and dull in appearance, it possessed such an ability.
