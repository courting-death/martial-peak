## Chapter 249 — I Am the Martial Artist of the Great Han

The sounds of battle shook the heavens, as seventeen or eighteen people formed a large circle, entrusting their defenses to others. In this moment, the elites from nearly ten sects united as one.

From time to time, Demonic Beasts fell dead, yet the martial artists continued to unleash their True Essence with great fervor.

As the stench of blood spread, the Demonic Beasts were roused to a frenzy, attacking recklessly as if possessed. This group of people was originally more than capable of dealing with over fifty Demonic Beasts, but with the arrival of Yang Kai and Zi Mo, another fifty Demonic Beasts were drawn over, increasing the pressure on everyone.

Accompanied by a scream, a martial artist was nearly pierced through the chest by a Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast, blood gushing forth. Though he did not die, he was severely wounded.

He was quite clever, immediately retreating into the protective circle formed by the others, who quickly filled the gap he left.

“Can you control the Demonic Beasts?” Yang Kai asked Zi Mo amidst the chaos.

“I’m trying, but it’s very difficult to control!” Zi Mo gritted her teeth, unleashing her killing moves while releasing her Control Soul Insect. However, those Demonic Beasts were all in a frenzied rush, rendering the Control Soul Insect ineffective.

After about a stick of incense, Zi Mo managed to control fewer than five Demonic Beasts, and not long after, those five were killed by the attacks of other Demonic Beasts.

As time passed, with the depletion of True Essence and the injuries sustained by the personnel, the situation gradually became perilous.

“What should we do?” Zi Mo asked anxiously, beads of sweat forming on her forehead. After such a long fight, only thirty Demonic Beasts had been killed, most of which were merely Fourth-Tier Demonic Beasts. The remaining Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts posed a lethal threat to everyone.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth, holding on. He was not worried about the blockade being breached; with his full strength unleashed, no Demonic Beast could approach him.

After pondering for a moment, he shouted, “Everyone, conserve some True Essence. If it really comes to it… just fly away! But remember, absolutely do not leave alone!”

Han Xiao Qi called out, “You just give the orders! We will follow your command!”

Ye Han expressed concern, “What about you? You’re only at the Separation and Union Realm…”

Everyone could fly, but only Yang Kai could not. If it came to that, he would surely be torn apart by the Demonic Beasts.

“I’ll take him with me!” Zi Mo said coldly.

Many people paused, casting surprised glances at her.

But this was not a foolproof plan. True Essence Realm martial artists could fly, but their speed was not very fast, and it consumed a lot of True Essence. If the Demonic Beasts pursued, they would only fall into greater danger.

The heated battle continued. More and more people were injured and retreated into the large circle, while the group gradually tightened their defensive line. Meanwhile, the Demonic Beasts suffered countless casualties.

Moments later, as if experiencing a resurgence, the Demonic Beasts suddenly intensified their attacks. Everyone was thrown into chaos, exhausted and overwhelmed.

Yang Kai remained calm, observing the situation while weighing the most appropriate moment to retreat.

Just as he was deep in thought, several Demonic Beasts suddenly charged in recklessly from the side. Zi Mo and Leng Shan stood side by side, working together to fend off the beasts. Just as they were engaged in battle, two Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts leapt over the horde, opening their massive jaws, one to the left and one to the right, lunging toward them with glistening fangs.

The two women’s expressions changed drastically, an icy chill spreading through them.

They were already struggling to cope with the current situation, and had no strength left to deal with Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts.

Relying on others? That was out of the question; everyone had their own enemies to face, even Yang Kai was no exception! If those two Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts managed to pounce on them, they would likely be gravely injured if not killed.

In the midst of their panic, Yang Kai disregarded the Demonic Beast before him, allowing it to leap onto him and bite down. His expression turned grave, brows furrowing in seriousness as a surge of Yuan Qi erupted from his palms.

With his left hand, he unleashed the White Tiger Seal, and with his right, the Divine Ox Seal, merging the two seals together!

A ghostly light shot out.

The Slave Beast Seal struck true on one of the Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts.

Immediately, that Fifth-Tier Demonic Beast bared its teeth and lunged at its companion, and in an instant, the two Demonic Beasts were locked in combat, resolving the crisis for Zi Mo and Leng Shan.

With lingering fear, they glanced at Yang Kai, gratitude flashing in their eyes.

Regardless of who it was, both had previously harbored thoughts of taking Yang Kai’s life, but by a twist of fate, they had been ensnared by him and ended up being controlled.

After spending time together, whether it was Zi Mo or Leng Shan, though they appeared obedient on the surface, they were constantly thinking of how to eliminate Yang Kai to free themselves from the imprint in their minds.

That thought had never diminished, even at this moment.

But it was undeniable that Yang Kai’s selfless act of saving them stirred something within Zi Mo and Leng Shan. Compared to their own sect members, this young man who had controlled them and tormented them multiple times, yet showed no mercy, seemed somewhat more reliable.

“Damn it!” Yang Kai cursed, realizing that in that brief moment of delay, the Demonic Beast before him had torn a piece of flesh from him. Though the injury was not severe, blood flowed freely. He roared in anger, unleashing his Yuan Qi violently, striking down with lethal force.

With one move, the failure of the two Fifth-Tier Demonic Beasts’ ambush caused the entire battlefield of Demonic Beasts to lose their momentum. After a brief flurry of attacks, some Demonic Beasts began to flee.

In just a short span of time, all the Demonic Beasts had fled cleanly, and those that hadn’t escaped were all killed.

The group stood in place, gasping for breath, each person covered in blood, looking utterly exhausted. As they gazed at the corpses of the Demonic Beasts strewn across the ground, they all felt a sense of surviving a calamity.

Suddenly, someone burst into laughter, as if a stone had been thrown into a calm lake, stirring up ripples that ignited everyone’s excitement and joy.

Laughter erupted continuously, and even the women smiled faintly.

They lived! They survived! Though it was arduous and unbelievable, they had made it through! They had thought that after being controlled by Yao He and Yao Xi, they would inevitably face death, but now, no one had perished!

And all of this was thanks to Yang Kai!

If it weren’t for him unexpectedly taking down Yao He and ambushing Yao Xi with Zi Mo, their fate would have been sealed.

“I owe you a life!” Zuo Fang from Wen Xin Palace turned to look at him, sincerity in his expression.

Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

“We all owe you a life!” Han Xiao Qi said with a smile.

After the battle, everyone rested without regard for their image. After this fight, nearly eighty percent of the people were injured, with only a handful remaining unscathed.

These injuries were not fatal; as long as they recuperated well, they could recover in at most half a month.

Yang Kai was not stingy, taking out a bottle of Healing Pill from his Spatial Pouch and distributing it to the injured, further deepening their gratitude.

After the joy of surviving the ordeal, a cloud of sorrow descended once more.

This sorrow stemmed from the two martial artists who had fallen and remained unresponsive.

Before dying, Yao Xi had ordered the martial artists under her control to attack Yang Kai and Zi Mo. But no one responded. In her rage, Yao Xi imposed punishment, attempting to force these individuals.

This punishment fell upon the two martial artists.

One was Li Xinyuan from Wen Xin Palace, who was also Zuo Fang’s senior brother, and the other was Bi Xiuming’s junior brother, one of those who had previously mocked Yang Kai.

Everyone gathered around them, their brows furrowed in concern.

“How is it?” Yang Kai squeezed into the crowd and asked.

Zuo Fang’s expression was grim, and he forced a smile, “Senior Brother’s Dantian was pierced by that insect.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted slightly, hesitating, “Then his cultivation…”

Zuo Fang slowly shook his head.

With the Dantian breached, his entire Yuan Qi dissipated. Though there was no danger to his life, he would forever be reduced to an ordinary person, unable to cultivate again unless he found a legendary medicine capable of repairing the Dantian.

However, such a pill only existed in legends; where could one find it?

Li Xinyuan was an elite of Wen Xin Palace; his qualifications and strength were naturally not lacking to enter this place, but now, due to a mere insect, he could no longer cultivate.

At this moment, Li Xinyuan’s face was ashen, his expression dull, as if he had lost his soul. This kind of blow was unbearable for anyone.

In contrast to his silence, another person with the same fate appeared much more agitated.

This person was Bi Xiuming’s junior brother, who had previously mocked Yang Kai multiple times. Perhaps it was karma. When Yao Xi chose to punish, he was also included.

He clutched Bi Xiuming tightly, tears streaming down his face, sobbing, “Senior Brother… I can still cultivate, right? My Dantian isn’t broken, is it?”

Bi Xiuming’s face was cold, his lips moving several times, but he didn’t know how to comfort him.

The crowd fell silent, a sense of desolation filling the air. Although they had not gotten along well with him before, and he had treated Yang Kai poorly, he was still a martial artist of the Great Han.

“Senior Brother, tell me, am I finished?” the man shouted, his face red and neck thick with emotion.

Bi Xiuming finally nodded with a pained expression.

“It’s impossible!” The man’s expression suddenly twisted with rage, “Impossible! How could a mere insect ruin my Dantian? I have exceptional talent; I’ve only been in the sect for ten years, yet I’ve already reached the Third Stage of the True Essence Realm! I will become a master of the Divine Roaming Realm, I will be one of the strongest in the world, I…”

As he screamed, he seemed to remember something and suddenly turned his gaze toward Zi Mo, who was standing nearby, “That’s right! She is a martial artist of the Tianlang; she must know a way to save me!”

Upon hearing this, everyone’s eyes lit up, even Li Xinyuan couldn’t help but look at Zi Mo, anticipation and tension filling everyone’s gaze.

Zi Mo’s expression remained calm as she slowly shook her head, “I have no way!”

Li Xinyuan’s gaze dimmed again, while Bi Xiuming’s junior brother roared, “You wretched woman! You are from Tianlang; that insect was brought by you! How could you not know? You must know, yet you refuse to help!”

Zi Mo’s face turned cold, her killing intent rising as she glared at him.

Yang Kai’s expression also turned icy in an instant.

Sensing the atmosphere was off, Chen Xueshu spoke up, “Don’t say that. Although the insect was brought by them, the one who attacked you was not this young lady. Moreover, this is a case of Dantian damage; who can possibly save you?”

The man sneered coldly, “What? She attacked us before, and now you’re speaking up for her? Open your eyes and see clearly; that’s the wretched woman of Tianlang! I am a martial artist of the Great Han!”
