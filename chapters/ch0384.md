## Chapter 384 — An Ambush

The Lan River flowed east and west, like a long dragon sprawling on the ground, dividing the land into two parts. 

On the river surface, which was more than several hundred zhang wide, the rapids heaved with fierce and surging waters, creating waves along the banks.

Yang Kai and his group of five arrived at the banks of the Lan River and couldn’t help but stop, gazing at the panting river water. 

“We're almost there! Once we cross the Lan River and pass through Feng Prefecture, we will reach Zhongdu!” Tu Feng spoke as if afraid that Yang Kai had been away from home for too long and didn’t remember the way back. “With the speed of the Treading Cloud Steed, it would take no more than three days.”

“En.” Yang Kai slightly nodded.

“Little Young Master, you all rest here, I’ll find a boat to cross the river!” Tu Feng chuckled, releasing his Divine Sense for a moment before turning to fly in one direction.

This group of people all had True Yuan Realm cultivation or higher. Even though the Lan River was over several hundred zhang wide, it couldn’t hinder their flight.

However, while people could fly, the Treading Cloud Steed could not. They still had to find a ferryboat to carry these Demonic Beasts across.

Before long, a boat of moderate size approached, with Tu Feng standing at the bow, shouting to the others.

Tang Yuxian smiled, pulling along her and Tu Feng's steed, and said, “Let’s go over.”

The four people and five Demonic Beasts arrived at the riverbank, ready to board the boat when the ferryman frowned and said to Tu Feng, “This brave man, why didn’t you tell me there were five horses with you?”

Luo Xiaoman couldn’t help but chuckle at these words.

The Treading Cloud Steed indeed resembled a horse, but despite their similarities, they were not the same category. It was understandable that an ordinary person couldn’t tell the difference.

Qiu Yimeng and Tang Yuxian also stifled their laughter.

Tu Feng replied, “What's wrong with having horses? Aren't you going to ferry the horses?”

“That’s not the issue.” The ferryman, an older man in his fifties, shook his head upon hearing this. “It’s just that the horses also require payment to cross the river.”

Tu Feng immediately rolled his eyes: “Payment is payment; it won't take anything away from you.”

Upon hearing this, the ferryman's face brightened: “Since the brave man says so, let’s hurry and board.”

Everyone slowly shook their heads. With their status and cultivation, they felt no need to argue over a trivial matter with an ordinary old man trying to earn a living. 

The boat was small, yet it was enough to carry five people and five Demonic Beasts at once.

With the ferryman’s skilled actions, the boat gracefully headed toward the center of the river.

Standing on the deck, Tang Yuxian laughed, “I’ve never been on a boat before. This rocking back and forth would surely make someone unaccustomed feel seasick.”

Tu Feng nodded and said, “Indeed, it’s not easy to make a living on the river.”

Though Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman didn’t say much, they also showed agreement, seeming to have never been on a boat before and thus were quite curious about this part of the journey, swaying their bodies with the boat while pointing at the rushing river water beside them.

“If a river is so fierce, what must the ocean be like?” Tu Feng said, veering off topic as he, despite his powerful strength and broad knowledge, had never been to the seaside in his life and thus couldn’t make any valid points. He turned to the ferryman and asked, “Old man, have you ever been to the seaside?”

The ferryman, with a simple smile, shook his head. “This old man has lived by the Lan River all his life. Where would I find the time to go to the seaside? However, even though I’ve never been, I’ve heard that the ships on the sea are massive, each at least several hundred zhang long. The waves in the ocean are fierce, yet the big ships sail smoothly without spilling a drop if a cup of water is placed on a table.”

“Is that true?” Tu Feng laughed, clearly skeptical.

“What do you mean it’s not true? Just think, those big ships are so enormous. Even if the winds and waves at sea are fierce, they can't shake them,” the ferryman replied earnestly.

The two Blood Servants and Qiu Yimeng, along with Luo Xiaoman, immediately showed interest. Though they knew the ferryman’s words couldn’t be taken seriously, they had nothing else to do and it would help pass the time hearing what he had to say.

Seeing their keen interest, the ferryman became more passionate and spoke with increased fervor. 

Yang Kai smiled silently on the side, his expression calm.

Among those present, he was the only one who had been to the sea and even ventured deep into it, nearly not returning. He chose not to dispute the ferryman's exaggerations. 

After a while, the boat reached the center of the Lan River.

While Yang Kai was lost in thought, a sudden unease washed over him, and a warning flashed in his mind, causing him to narrow his eyes, fixed on the ferryman without faltering.

The ferryman continued to chat about the sea, but Yang Kai suddenly interjected, “Old man, your rowing technique seems a bit off.”

The others aboard the boat were taken aback and turned to look at Yang Kai.

The ferryman laughed, “What do you mean by that, young man?”

Yang Kai's smile was slight: “Experienced rowers find a rhythm in their breathing, especially on a river with such violent currents. If you can’t find the rhythm, you’ll expend twice the effort compared to others! Since you’ve lived by the water all your life, surely you must understand this, right?”

Hearing this, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian’s expressions suddenly grew serious, and they warily observed the ferryman.

A fleeting flicker of surprise and panic appeared in the ferryman’s eyes, but he quickly composed himself and replied, “What the young man says makes sense. It’s just that I’ve rowed this way my entire life, so I’ve gotten used to it. I’ll try your method next time and see if it saves some effort.”

Yang Kai continued, his tone chilling, “You’ve been rowing like this for half the river and haven’t changed your expression nor quickened your heartbeat. Also... since you live by the river, you must eat river fish, yet there isn’t a hint of fishy smell on this boat… Hehe!”

His voice grew colder as his eyes narrowed, sounding ominous: “Old man, you are not an ordinary person.” 

His words barely left his lips when Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian charged at the ferryman together.

At that moment, a Silver Blood Golden Feather Eagle soaring in the sky let out a sharp screech, its cry carrying a clear warning tone.

Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman’s expressions changed. They quickly urged their power.

Splash!

Suddenly, several water spouts erupted from the river around them, each concealing a person.

An overwhelming force pulled from below, and the boat which had been gliding smoothly all at once seemed to sink into a quagmire, unable to advance or retreat, sinking rapidly.

Yang Kai, Qiu Yimeng, and Luo Xiaoman were about to leap into the air when a sudden, immense pressure descended from above. They encountered an ambush, and all three plummeted down.

A gigantic whirlpool suddenly emerged, swiftly swallowing the entire boat, along with everyone on it, into the river.

The five Treading Cloud Steeds were also caught up in the maelstrom, vanishing in an instant.

As they fell into the water, Yang Kai immediately sensed an unparalleled explosive force nearby; it was evident that the two Blood Servants had already engaged with the ferryman.

Around them, shadowy figures glided like fish, quickly closing in.

In a hurried scan of his surroundings, he felt his expression darken.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian were underwater, battling three opponents. All three were masters of the Divine Roaming Realm, each far from mediocre—a level eight, a level seven, and a level five Divine Roaming Realm practitioner. Although the two Blood Servants were formidable, they found it difficult to escape in such a predicament.

The nearest enemy was less than ten zhang away from Yang Kai. He saw the man grinning malevolently at him underwater, his palms moving to conjure a streak of green light that surged toward him through the water.

Yang Kai struck out with a fist, unleashing explosive power akin to a shining golden seal, colliding with the green light.

With a muffled boom, the green light dimmed somewhat but wasn't fully halted. In a moment of urgency, Yang Kai could only twist his body to evade and rapidly shot upwards toward the surface.

In the blink of an eye, he glanced around and saw that Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman were not too far from him. However, their position was undoubtedly safer than his since the individuals under the water, aside from the three masters entangled with Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, were all converging toward him.

They were coming for him!

Yang Kai instantly understood and had no time to ponder the reasons behind it. He broke through the surface of the water in mere moments, leaping into the air. Yet before he could escape, a figure emerged below—one of the attackers who had assaulted him earlier. This man gazed at Yang Kai coldly, with a seemingly nonchalant demeanor. He flicked his hand, sending a streak of bright light arcing toward Yang Kai.

At this critical moment, the Golden Feather Eagle unexpectedly swooped in, its wings spreading wide as countless golden sparks descended.

A dazzling light surrounded him, causing the attacker to panic, letting out a strange cry before diving back into the water.

Seizing this chance, Yang Kai shifted directions and quickly flew toward the riverbank.

With splashes echoing, six or seven figures floated in midair. They scanned their surroundings briefly before pursuing Yang Kai. Among them were Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman, who were there to assist Yang Kai.

“Stop them!” commanded a middle-aged man in a grave tone. “Don’t kill them!”

Immediately, two others responded, breaking from the group and grinning as they approached Qiu Yimeng and Luo Xiaoman.

Qiu Yimeng’s charming face darkened. She softly warned Luo Xiaoman, “They seem to be after Yang Kai. When the time comes to strike, leave no room for mercy; they won’t dare kill you.”

“En.” Luo Xiaoman nodded earnestly, her wet clothes accentuating her alluring figure.

With another loud splash, two Blood Servants emerged from the water, facing off against the three Divine Roaming Realm masters. Tu Feng was tense, his entire body shrouded in a brown glow, attacking fiercely, showing no regard for his safety.

Tang Yuxian was also summoning her True Yuan, her graceful body twisting as various Martial Skills were unleashed, her face reflecting anxiety.

“Who are you? Do you dare touch the Yang Family of Zhongdu?” Tu Feng bellowed, a gust of energy rolling forth.
