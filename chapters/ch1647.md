## Chapter 1647 — Nothing Special

Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly. Not daring to confront her head-on, he withdrew and restrained his own Shi.

If one’s Shi were forcibly broken, it would cause great harm to oneself, and repairing it would be extremely troublesome.

"Array power?" Yang Kai quickly realized what had changed on Ran Yunting.

She was clearly drawing on an array from Icebound Island, which explained how she could reach such a degree.

It was not surprising — Ran Yunting's status in Ice Heart Valley was high, ranked only below the Grand Elder and the Valley Lord; being able to marshal an array's power was only natural.

"Hahaha, my Ice Heart Valley's Icebound Great Array can rank first on Chi Lan Star — boy, if you die beneath the great array you may rest in peace!" Ran Yunting laughed loudly, waving the token in her hand and trailing a strand of light; she seemed to melt into the surrounding frost and vanish without a trace.

Yet from the surroundings countless ice-blade-like attacks suddenly materialized, like a locust swarm, sweeping across the sky toward Yang Kai.

This was the might of the Icebound Great Array! Even a Void King Realm expert trapped within would find it hard to break free safely.

The moment Ran Yunting called upon the great array against Yang Kai, the island's experts all noticed.

Within the inner island, in the Valley Lord's ice palace, Bing Long's expression changed as she looked up into the void: "Who is mobilizing the great array's power? Is it the Great Elder?"

Her divine sense spread out and she quickly saw the fighting at the outer island's Ice Peak; she could not help but cry out and hurriedly emerged from her ice palace, flying over at speed.

A dozen or so elders on the inner island also detected it and rushed this way.

At an unknown place, a silver-haired woman sat cross-legged beside a cold pool. She looked young, in the bloom of youth, yet her aura was far stronger than Bing Long's or Ran Yunting's.

A Void King Realm expert!

The Grand Elder of Ice Heart Valley — Luo Li!

The contrast between her silver hair and the girl's face formed a striking visual clash that made her stunningly beautiful.

At this moment she seemed to be drawing on the cold of the pool for some purpose; her lips parted slightly, and with each breath a pale, misty chill was drawn from the pool and poured into her abdomen.

Luo Li's complexion was somewhat pale — a lingering aftereffect from a previous cultivation mishap.

When the Icebound Great Array was activated she had perceived it, but she only glanced in a certain direction and paid it no further heed.

For someone of her stature, what happened outside did not require her interference; it was only the juniors' antics, and Bing Long would go handle it.

Yet just as Luo Li was about to continue healing, her expression changed; she seemed to sense something and looked toward another direction. Her face grew more serious than ever as she murmured, "Chi Huo, you truly couldn't hold back? Daring to trespass onto my Icebound Island… huh, this is… no wonder, no wonder you had such confidence!"

After detecting the other's presence, Luo Li's face grew even grimmer; after a long moment she sighed, "I don't know if Icebound Island can weather this crisis. I hope you won't go too far."

With that she rose slowly; her body shimmered and she vanished from the spot, leaving a clear afterimage.

…

"Foolish — if you could mobilize the Icebound Great Array's full might you might be able to slay me, but with your meager skill, how much of the array's power can you really borrow?" Yang Kai shouted, and suddenly a five-colored radiance bloomed around him. The shifting light made one dare not stare; an unprecedentedly fierce qi erupted from him.

Yang Kai clenched the void and golden light split from his body, condensing in his hand to form a brilliantly golden longsword.

The Undying Five Elements Sword qi — the Metal Sword, ruler of slaughter!

Sword in hand, Yang Kai's killing intent rose like a tide; that killing qi, thick as substance, made Ran Yunting's eyes tremble violently. She screamed, wildly urging her Saint Yuan into the token, attempting to use the great array's power to crush Yang Kai.

Countless ice blades, cones, and arrows took shape in the void and once more shot toward Yang Kai.

"Good!" Yang Kai bellowed, and the golden sword in his hand began to whirl.

The golden light was blinding, seeming to cleave the void; its molten-gold radiance outshone the whole Icebound Island as razor-sharp sword qi shot forth.

The ice blades, cones, and arrows, like snowflakes under the scorching sun, were all cut to pieces and dissolved.

Within a ten zhang radius of Yang Kai, no one could come close!

He stood wild and unrestrained, black hair flying like a war god of old descending; his every sweep exuded boundless heroic spirit.

Numerous women of Ice Heart Valley watched stunned, feeling an uncontrollable stirring in their hearts; it made them tremble and pour all their minds upon Yang Kai, until nothing in the world remained but that figure standing in mid-air.

On the inner island Su Yan's ice chamber suddenly opened; she rushed out and at first glance saw the familiar figure enveloped in golden light a hundred li away.

"Junior Brother!" Su Yan murmured.

Though soft, her voice seemed to cross the hundred-li distance; Yang Kai, who was wielding the golden sword, actually turned and glanced her way, grinning.

Su Yan returned a smile, then charged off toward him.

At that moment her master's orders and the sect's rules no longer bound her — in her heart and eyes there was only the man who had made a ruckus on Icebound Island for her sake.

If she could see him close once more and slip into his embrace, she would die without regret.

"Where do you think you're running!"

"Su Yan, you stop right there!"

Zhou Yunxuan and another female disciple who were watching Su Yan had also been focused on the battle a hundred li away, but when they recovered they were horrified to find Su Yan had run out; the two women were alarmed and hurried in pursuit, calling loudly as they ran.

"Su Yan, how dare you defy the Great Elder's order — you will be punished!"

"Hurry back; return now and you'll suffer less of the beating, otherwise no one can save you!"

Su Yan pretended not to hear, as if oblivious; her figure grew more distant and soon vanished from Zhou Yunxuan and the other's sight.

"This is bad!" Zhou Yunxuan's face went pale — no matter what, they would bear the guilt of poor guarding, and the Great Elder would surely punish them.

"That bitch — she's infuriating me!" the other woman ground her teeth and cursed. "Senior Sister Zhou, what do we do now?"

"Go after her." Zhou Yunxuan stamped her foot and continued the chase.

Laughter burst like rolling thunder across Icebound Island as Yang Kai, wrapped in the array's might, rampaged; his swordlight whipped out like a banner, shredding Ran Yunting's assault into tatters.

Ran Yunting's face was ferocious, her eyes full of shock and disbelief.

Just how monstrous was this young man?

With only the cultivation of the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, he was actually able to completely suppress her—even when she had drawn upon part of the Icebound Great Array’s power!

She had believed that at the Origin Returning Realm she was among the very best and that few in that tier could match her, but today she felt the truth — there are always higher mountains and greater people.

If this Yang Kai can already do this, should he break through to the Third Stage, might he not contend with an ordinary Void King Realm?

The thought made Ran Yunting shudder.

Terror only strengthened her determination to slay Yang Kai.

If this youth did not die, Ice Heart Valley would surely face enormous trouble in the future!

"Ice Heart Valley's Great Elder — nothing special!" Yang Kai shouted in a deep voice, not placing Ran Yunting in his eyes at all. Holding a sword in his left hand, he pressed the two fingers of his right hand together, brushed them along the golden blade, and gave a low command: “Go!”

The golden light flashed and the fierce blade instantly shot toward Ran Yunting, the next moment aiming to pierce her through.

Even as Ran Yunting frantically poured the array's might in, she could not stop this golden strike.

For a moment Ran Yunting went pale and her gaze faltered.

Only then did she realize Yang Kai's earlier bow had not been out of fear but to sever the ties between her and Su Yan.

When their fate was ended, he could without hesitation move to kill her.

Regret?

None! Ran Yunting's eyes hardened again — even in death she would not regret her choice.

Su Yan would be Ice Heart Valley's future pillar; whether the valley could be made glorious and overpower the Fire Radiance Sect to become the strongest force on Chi Lan Star all depended on Su Yan's ability.

She might die here, but killing the Great Elder of Ice Heart Valley was no small matter. Once the Grand Elder held him accountable, Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to live either.

As long as Yang Kai died, Su Yan would be able to mend the flaw in her heart—and devote herself fully to cultivation!

She would surely bloom with brilliance that illuminated the entire Star Domain—her future self destined to stand at its very pinnacle!

What was this youth but nothing? No matter how gifted he seemed, in the end Su Yan would leave him far behind.

With death imminent, Ran Yunting stood motionless, staring at Yang Kai with a strange, feral smile.

At that moment the Icebound Great Array's power suddenly spiked; the array that had seemed unable to stop the golden sword unleashed an unimaginable effect as dense frigid qi converged to form a flawless ice wall before Ran Yunting.

The golden sword slipped in with a grinding, teeth-clenching sound, inching bit by bit toward Ran Yunting.

The ice wall seemed unable to halt the golden sword's thrust!

Yet Yang Kai frowned and turned his head to look elsewhere.

Over there, the Valley Lord Bing Long had somehow appeared, also holding a token that resonated with Ran Yunting's token, magnifying the Icebound Great Array's might.

Her face was grave and sweat beaded on her brow as she drove her own Saint Yuan into the token.

More Ice Heart Valley elders appeared, each crying out as they drew forth their tokens.

With the backing of many elders, the Icebound Great Array's might grew ever greater.

In the end the golden sword's advance was halted, stopped only three cun away from Ran Yunting.

The razor-sharp sword qi, coiling like a serpent's core, tore through Ran Yunting's brow and a bead of crimson blood welled from between her brows, shockingly bright.
