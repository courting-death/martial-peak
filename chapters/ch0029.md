## Chapter 29 — A Great Loss

Having suffered a hidden loss once, Li Yuntian dared not be careless. With agile footwork, he danced around Yang Kai, darting up and down, seeking the perfect moment to strike. Soon, he had landed over a dozen palm strikes on Yang Kai’s body.

“You’re so petty, making me run to the Contribution Hall early in the morning just to be humiliated,” Li Yuntian thought with secret satisfaction. His blows were heavy and forceful, each strike landing with a sharp thud on Yang Kai’s body. Watching from afar, Su Mu felt dizzy and entranced, as if he himself were delivering the blows. The pleasure in his heart was indescribable.

Both combatants were cultivators at the Body Tempering Realm, their training only just beginning. Their fighting techniques were limited and simple. Moreover, Yang Kai was deliberately testing his current physical condition, which allowed Li Yuntian to take considerable advantage.

After a tea’s time of sparring, Yang Kai had already made up his mind. His body was holding up well, far better than before. Having achieved his purpose, he no longer intended to entangle with this junior disciple.

Just as Li Yuntian prepared to press his advantage, he suddenly noticed the once retreating Yang Kai’s expression turn wildly excited—like a demon possessed by lust who had just seen a young maiden stripped bare. That gleam of excitement sent chills down Li Yuntian’s spine.

But on closer inspection, this excitement was different—cruel and bloodthirsty.

Li Yuntian’s heart sank. He tried to put distance between them, but Yang Kai stepped forward like a towering mountain blocking his path.

Li Yuntian leapt high, attempting to break free from Yang Kai’s pursuit. Yang Kai responded with a flying kick, heavy and forceful, sweeping across Li Yuntian’s waist.

A miserable cry rang out as Li Yuntian was sent flying like a broken sack, tumbling several zhang away. Before he could rise, Yang Kai bounded forward, straddling him and raining down a storm of fists.

Screams echoed instantly.

The sparring only ended when Li Yuntian begged for mercy.

At first, when Yang Kai had knocked Li Yuntian to the ground and pummeled him, Li Yuntian still tried to resist. But Yang Kai’s attacks were reckless and unrelenting, as if exchanging injury for injury in a frenzy.

Soon, Li Yuntian could no longer hold on. He noticed something strange: after being hit, his own reaction was completely different from Yang Kai’s.

When he struck Yang Kai, the latter grew more and more excited. But when Yang Kai struck him, Li Yuntian felt unbearable pain.

Who in this world would be excited from taking a beating? In the end, Li Yuntian even saw Yang Kai’s skin redden, blood surging beneath, veins bulging, his face twisted into a ferocious, almost mad expression.

Li Yuntian once thought Yang Kai had truly gone mad. Yet after the sparring ended, Yang Kai returned to normal—kind and gentle, warmly helping him up from the ground, smiling and saying, “Well fought,” before picking up his broom and leaving.

He was like two different people in and out of battle!

Li Yuntian’s body ached all over, having taken many of Yang Kai’s fists. How could he not be injured?

This time, he had truly lost out. Li Yuntian wanted to cry but had no tears.

Yang Kai had repeatedly refused to spar, yet Li Yuntian had begged him to fight using herbs bought with twenty Contribution Points. In the end, he was beaten, lost the herbs, and had Contribution Points deducted.

This was a great loss! Was he not just asking for punishment? Li Yuntian was filled with regret.

Su Mu and the others watched dumbfounded nearby. When Li Yuntian and Yang Kai first clashed, they even cheered, celebrating Li Yuntian’s strategy finally succeeding and anticipating the scene of Yang Kai being beaten.

Su Mu had even planned to mock Yang Kai once he was beaten to a pulp, to vent his own frustration. But when the fight began, everyone was shocked—Yang Kai and Li Yuntian fought to a draw.

For a moment, Su Mu felt dizzy and asked suspiciously, “What realm is Li Yuntian at again?”

“Body Tempering Realm, Seventh Stage. There’s some nascent Primordial Qi in his body, but he hasn’t learned any martial techniques yet,” someone nearby answered.

“And Yang Kai?”

“Probably Body Tempering Realm, Fourth Stage,” came the uncertain reply.

The group exchanged stunned glances. The difference in their cultivation stages was three levels, yet they fought evenly. This was astonishing. No wonder Zhao Hu was defeated in three moves yesterday. With Yang Kai’s current strength, Zhao Hu would be no match even at full power.

But how could the rumored punching bag be so strong? If he truly had such power, why had he always been defeated before? Yang Kai had been in the sect for over three years, and since the first year, he had been challenged repeatedly—never winning for over two years.

What shocked Su Mu and the others even more was what followed. They had thought it a miracle that Yang Kai could even hold his own against Li Yuntian, but when Yang Kai actually defeated him, the group fell silent, unable to believe their eyes.

A Body Tempering Realm Fourth Stage disciple defeating one at the Seventh Stage—such a thing had never occurred in Lingxiao Pavilion’s centuries of history. Could it be that even a worthless salted fish had its day?

Lost in thought, Su Mu suddenly felt a tap on his shoulder. Turning, he saw Yang Kai holding his broom, smiling warmly at him.

“Junior Brother Su, next time there’s something like this, be sure to let me know.”

“You knew all along?” Su Mu’s mouth twitched.

Yang Kai chuckled, “That Junior Brother Li was hiding behind the crowd yesterday, but as a senior brother, my only advantage is a good memory.”

“Truly devious!” Su Mu ground his teeth in frustration, realizing only now that they had all been fooled by Yang Kai.

“Likewise,” Yang Kai smiled. “Oh, by the way, I can challenge again tomorrow. We all get one chance a day, right? Have fun, I’ll see you tomorrow.”

The group’s expressions immediately darkened. Yang Kai’s words implied he had developed a taste for this. Looking at Li Yuntian’s current state and comparing their strength, everyone shuddered and asked in horror, “Junior Brother Su, what do we do now?”

Su Mu was at a loss. After all, challenges were a sect custom. Every disciple had been challenged before. Though he had backing, he dared not recklessly break sect rules.

“Don’t worry. He’s probably just trying to scare you. If he really dares to challenge you, I’ll make sure he regrets it.”

Hearing this, the group felt slightly reassured.

Yang Kai’s challenge was a spur-of-the-moment decision. Lingxiao Pavilion disciples had one daily challenge opportunity. He had never used it before and had forgotten about it until Li Yuntian reminded him today.

One challenge per day, winning against an Outer Disciple only earned two Contribution Points, but every bit counts. Over a month, the total would be considerable.

Moreover, the path of cultivation must not be closed off. Sparring daily with fellow disciples, moving limbs and hands, was beneficial and harmless. It didn’t take much time and was a form of relaxation—and earned Contribution Points. Why not?

In fact, today’s challenge was the most profitable. Not only did he gain two Contribution Points, but also ten of the rare Desolate Deadwood Herbs he so desperately needed. A huge gain.

If only someone brought him ten herbs every day, how wonderful that would be! Yang Kai’s mind wandered.

Returning to his wooden hut, he took out an incense burner and lit fragrant incense, continuing his arduous cultivation.
