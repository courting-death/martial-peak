## Chapter 1433 — Dayan Divine Stone

It's not surprising he couldn't identify it; although Yang Kai has traveled far and wide these years and seen much, he cannot recognize every material in the world.

But since Yang Yan disturbed him at such a sensitive moment and produced a mineral like this, its value must be extraordinary, and it might very well be of immense help to him.

Otherwise, Yang Yan would never have done such a thing.

His Divine Sense swept over it and detected no oddity at all, as if the stone before him were nothing more than an ordinary rock.

"Try pouring Saint Yuan in it!" Yang Yan prompted from the side.

Yang Kai did not hesitate; he placed his hand over the stone, Saint Yuan exploding forth. The next moment his expression changed sharply and he quickly withdrew his hand, horrified: "It swallowed the Saint Yuan?"

It wasn't that Yang Kai was overly dramatic — the stone was simply too strange. At his realm and strength, pouring Saint Yuan into it produced no reaction, as if it were a bottomless pit that could devour endless Saint Yuan.

He had never encountered such a thing before.

This stone truly was an extraordinary object!

“What’s this?” Yang Kai asked, his eyes lighting up with eager curiosity.

"The Dayan Divine Stone!"

"The Dayan Divine Stone?" Yang Kai frowned; he'd never heard of such a thing. Even Ye Xijun, standing behind Yang Yan, knit her brows — clearly she had never heard of it either.

"What use does it have?"

"Didn't you just test it?" Yang Yan smiled lightly. "Devouring energy is the Dayan Divine Stone's primary trait. It itself is a Void King-Grade refining material; if forged into a Secret Treasure...what do you think would happen in a fight?"

Hearing that, Yang Kai's eyes brightened. If that were true, a Secret Treasure made from a Dayan Divine Stone would be anathema to all Martial Skill, because Martial Skill is released using Saint Yuan, and the Dayan Divine Stone can devour it — the enemy's Martial Skill might be swallowed clean before it even reached you.

"Not bad, not bad. Truly a fine thing." Yang Kai nodded repeatedly. Since it was a Void King-Grade refining material, any Secret Treasure forged from it would likely be Void King-Grade as well — treasures of that caliber on Dark Star were rarer than phoenix feathers.

The Bone-Eroding Severing Flame Lamp in Ye Xijun's hand was itself a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure with a formidable reputation.

After praising it, Yang Kai's expression turned strangely odd. "But what does this have to do with me?"

He didn't believe Yang Yan had summoned him out of seclusion merely to show off a Void King-Grade refining material. Yang Yan wasn't that frivolous; there had to be deeper purpose.

"The Dayan Divine Stone has nothing to do with you directly, but what it contains is useful to you!" Yang Yan said with inscrutable amusement.

"Contains something inside?" Yang Kai looked surprised.

"Indeed. The Dayan Divine Stone is a very special mineral; it can devour energy, even the Spiritual Qi of the heavens and earth. This Dayan Divine Stone was given to us by a mid-tier family. According to their Family Head, they obtained it from an ancient ruin several thousand years ago, so its history must be very, very long."

"Why would a mid-tier family give us something like this?" Yang Kai was more puzzled.

"Isn't it because you wanted to sell several prime plots? The outside forces are fighting bitterly to secure early access to those plots in the Imperial Garden. We've even obtained one Imperial Jade. Not to mention other items. This Dayan Divine Stone was the family's bargaining chip."

"I see. Looks like that family didn't know the value," Yang Kai grinned, schadenfreude on his face. Void King-Grade materials were far too precious on Dark Star; if they knew its worth, they wouldn't have used it as a bargaining chip.

"You're wrong." Yang Yan shook her head slowly. "Though that family has declined and isn't strong now, in ancient times they produced many experts. They might not recognize a Dayan Divine Stone, but they knew it's a Void King-Grade material."

Yang Kai frowned and hesitated, "Then why..."

"Precisely because they knew it was Void King-Grade, they used the Dayan Divine Stone to try to sway us. Do you think something of too little value could win our few plots in Dark Star's countless forces?" Yang Yan smiled. "That family was lucky to obtain an Imperial Jade, but their top expert is only Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. To find good treasures in the Imperial Garden they had to seek our help and enter early."

Yang Kai nodded lightly, understanding dawning on his face.

Void King-Grade materials come at a steep price, but no matter how precious, they pale compared to the temptation of early access to the Imperial Garden — on Dark Star no one could refine Void King-Grade materials, so the Dayan Divine Stone in that family's hands was little more than a worthless rib.

Better to use it as a chip to contend for those plots.

They were fortunate to meet a connoisseur like Yang Yan, who instantly recognized the Dayan Divine Stone's great value; otherwise the deal might not have succeeded.

Lingxiao Sect reached an agreement with that family, exchanging a large amount of Saint Crystal and the Dayan Divine Stone for one plot; once the Imperial Garden opens they can let the family enter Lingxiao Sect — a mutually happy transaction.

"You said what's inside is of great use to me — what do you mean?" Yang Kai asked.

"I was going to tell you anyway; why else call you out? Aren't you searching for an earth-attributed Heaven-and-Earth treasure?"

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded, then his expression brightened and he looked at her in surprise. "Could it be..."

"Indeed!" Yang Yan smiled. "Although the Dayan Divine Stone itself is not earth-attributed, the Dayan Divine Sand contained within it is undoubtedly an earth-attributed treasure — more than enough to meet your needs!"

"Dayan Divine Sand!" Yang Kai's eyes lit up.

"The Dayan Divine Stone constantly devours heavenly and earthly Spiritual Qi. Given enough time, grains like sand will form inside — those are the Dayan Divine Sand. The Dayan Divine Stone itself isn't useful to you; I can use it to forge Secret Treasures."

"Not bad, not bad!" Yang Kai grinned widely, greatly pleased.

He sought an earth-attributed treasure to cultivate the body-refining art Undying Five Elements Sword. The technique was discovered in the ruins of the Guyang Sect; according to its description, if cultivated to perfection it could make the body immortal.

Yang Kai had coveted it for a long time.

Unfortunately, the conditions to cultivate it were extreme: it demanded stringent requirements of the practitioner's Divine Sense and physical strength, and required gathering the five elements' treasures of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

Among the five elements, Yang Kai already possessed Thundertree for wood, Sun's True Essence for fire, Profound Yin Moon Water for water, and even Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade — wood, fire, and water were already gathered.

At the last auction in Jubao Tower he acquired Xuan Gold, a metal-attributed treasure, which even soured his relations with Jin Shi and Old Woman Feng. Now only the earth-attributed material was missing.

If the Dayan Divine Sand truly exists as Yang Yan said, he could complete the five elements and immediately begin cultivating the Undying Five Elements Sword!

The advantage of a powerful body is obvious: aside from superiority in fights, Yang Kai's command of spatial power requires a sturdy body whenever he tears space to flee thousands of miles — without a robust body the tearing alone could destroy a person.

As Yang Kai's understanding of spatial force deepened, the demands on his body would only grow, which was why he was so eager to collect materials for the Undying Five Elements Sword.

Excited for a moment, Yang Kai hurried, "Then what are we waiting for? Extract the Dayan Divine Sand at once!"

Yang Yan shot him a reproachful look. "Do you think it's that easy to extract? The Dayan Divine Stone can devour energy; with my current methods I cannot refine it."

Yang Kai's face froze as if doused with cold water; his previous excitement vanished instantly.

Yang Yan stifled a chuckle.

"You tricked me?" Yang Kai was furious. Seeing her like this, he knew she had planned all along — if extracting Dayan Divine Sand were truly impossible, why would she summon him?

"I haven't finished speaking." Yang Yan looked a little pleased but no longer teasing; her expression turned solemn. "Indeed, by my methods I cannot refine it to extract the Dayan Divine Sand, but the Stone Puppet can!"

Saying that, Yang Yan pointed to the Stone Puppet crouched on the table.

Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

As the saying goes, one becomes blind in their immediate surroundings; he had forgotten the Stone Puppet's innate divine art of devouring mineral essences and refining them. Though the Dayan Divine Stone was of high grade, it could not resist the Stone Puppet's devouring.

After all, the Stone Puppet could come and go freely even in places like Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain; a single Dayan Divine Stone was hardly a challenge.

"But I must warn you: although the Dayan Divine Sand will certainly form inside the Dayan Divine Stone, the amount depends on its age. Perhaps this stone contains only two or three grains of it, which might not be enough, or perhaps it contains many — it depends on your luck. That's why I had Qian Yue call you out of seclusion."

Yang Kai frowned; he naturally understood what Yang Yan meant: the older the stone, the more Dayan Divine Sand forms within it.

After a moment's thought, Yang Kai asked, "How long does it take for one grain of Dayan Divine Sand to form?"

"Heh, the birth of such things is measured in thousands, even ten-thousands of years. If you plan to wait to extract them later, you'll be waiting a very, very long time!"

"Then there's nothing to say — extract it now!" Yang Kai's expression hardened and he turned to the Stone Puppet, issuing it the command in his heart.
