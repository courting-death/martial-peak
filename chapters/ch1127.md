## Chapter 1127 — Is This a Joke?

After Ba Qingyan finished speaking, Wu Yi remained silent. Yu Feng snorted coldly, as if for the first time realizing his elder's shameless brazenness; even his face flushed red.

Yang Kai let out a dry, cold chuckle. Ba Qingyan truly was an old fox—his words and tone carried the unmistakable air of a host toward a guest, of the Haike Family being master here while Yang Kai was merely a visitor; it was almost as if he wanted to say outright, “This is our territory—if you live here, show some respect.”

Ba Qingyan seemed aware that he had little authority in front of these two. Having spoken, he no longer cared about their reactions; he clasped his fists at Yang Kai in a friendly salute and turned to leave.

The man called Wu Ke wore a complicated expression, glancing at Wu Yi then at Yang Kai, jealousy practically spitting from his eyes. He had not expected that the moment Wu Yi left the family she would cling to such a powerful friend.

The young women who had followed Ba Qingyan looked at Wu Yi with unbridled envy, turning back every few steps and covertly sending flirtatious glances toward Yang Kai, as if a single word from him would make them throw themselves at him.

After a while only Yang Kai, Yang Yan, Wu Yi and Yu Feng remained; even the birds and beasts around Dragon Lair Mountain had vanished.

Wu Yi's eyes were rimmed in red; she forced a smile. "Yang Kai, I'm embarrassed you had to see this."

"How could they behave like that?" Yu Feng muttered. Once they had taken pride in belonging to the Haike Family, but the events of today and the family's reaction had shattered the long-held sense of belonging and honor. Wu Yi would rather, after announcing her departure, have Ba Qingyan act decisively to drag her back and mete out family punishment—even if it meant being beaten to death—than witness him, as an elder, conduct himself with such slippery politeness and opportunism.

This weak-willed family was nothing like the one she had imagined.

Yang Kai understood what she was thinking and said calmly, "In this world strength rules. Without power you can only grovel; survival is no easy thing."

Wu Yi seemed to gain some insight and lifted her eyes to look at him; a faint confusion flickered in her beautiful gaze.

Yu Feng was less contemplative and spoke with worry, "Yang Kai, you killed Xu Zhishen today. The Xu Family won't let this rest. They didn't realize how powerful you were before, so they only sent someone today. Once the survivors return to report, the Xu Family will come for you. Shouldn't you leave at once? Delay could bring disaster."

Yang Yan interrupted before Yang Kai could answer: "Leave? Why would we leave? Give me some materials and I'll set up arrays here."

Yang Kai had no desire to leave. Beyond the fact that Wu Yi and Yu Feng had been implicated today, there was still that huge vein of Ethereal Crystal beneath Dragon Lair Mountain. If they were to go, they'd at least have to wait for the Stone Puppet to finish harvesting the Ethereal Crystal from that seam.

He cultivated spatial power and needed vast quantities of Ethereal Crystal; once this opportunity was gone there would be no second chance.

Yang Kai had never known Yang Yan's true proficiency with arrays before, but her performance today surprised him and eased his mind considerably.

Besides, he was now in the Saint King Realm. He didn't know if he could contend with fighters of the Origin Returning Realm, but if the Xu Family had no experts of that caliber, he wasn't afraid of however many came.

"What materials do you need?" Yang Kai asked.

“Ores—and materials for cultivation. Anything’s fine, as long as it’s not medicinal ingredients for pill refining.”

"I have some here," Wu Yi said as she checked her Spatial Ring.

"I have some too, though not much and of lower grade," Yu Feng added.

"No matter—let Yang Kai pay for them," Yang Yan giggled. Others might not know how wealthy Yang Kai was, but she did. The secret treasures he'd recently refined had all been exchanged by him for Saint Crystals, and he still had so much Ethereal Crystal that selling a single piece would net tens of thousands of Saint Crystals.

"I just broke through and need to consolidate my cultivation. Yu Feng, could you run to Tianyun City?" Yang Kai said, taking fifty thousand Upper-Level Saint Crystals from his Black Book Space, placing them in a Spatial Pouch and handing it to Yu Feng.

Though he'd never seen such a low-grade storage secret treasure before, when Yu Feng received it and scanned it with Divine Sense his expression changed drastically. "So many Saint Crystals?"

Those Saint Crystals amounted to nearly a year's income for the entire Haike Family. He could not fathom how Yang Kai had amassed such a fortune in so short a time.

After all, when they had first taken him in he had nothing—his only Spatial Ring had been taken by them and he was essentially penniless.

On the other hand, Yang Kai giving him so many Saint Crystals at once made Yu Feng feel deeply trusted. He hurriedly promised, "Brother Yang, rest assured—I will buy the most materials at the best prices."

He glanced once more at Wu Yi and added, "Please take care of the young lady for the time being."

Yang Kai nodded, and only then did Yu Feng fly off toward Tianyun City.

Yang Kai trusted Yu Feng; a man willing to confront his own elders to defend Wu Yi might be a bit reckless, but he wasn't scheming.

"Wu Yi, rest for a while—your complexion is poor," Yang Kai said, watching her.

Wu Yi nodded lightly and, accompanied by Yang Yan, wordlessly walked into the cave.

Back in the cave Yang Kai cleared his Spatial Ring and Black Book Space of anything he didn't need, handing all of it to Yang Yan. He was confident in her abilities; if she was to lay formations to protect the cave, more materials would be better.

He kept the Avian Tree born from the Tenth-Tier Demonic Beast Thunder Luan; its thunderly attribute might prove useful, and he would need to discuss its uses with Yang Yan.

After dealing with everything, he arranged dozens of Upper-Level Saint Crystals beside him and sat among the Gathering Spirit Seven-Colored Flags to stabilize his current Saint King Realm cultivation.

For small Stage promotions such stabilization isn't particularly crucial, but after a major realm breakthrough it is indispensable and greatly benefits future cultivation.

The commotion at Dragon Lair Mountain had temporarily subsided, but the Haike Family was in uproar.

A male friend of Wu Yi with a cultivation of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm had slain Xu Zhishen, who was at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, and seized two of Xu Zhishen's secret treasures. The other friend was not only a Saint-Grade artificer but also a formation master of great skill.

News of this spread among the Haike Family's upper echelons, leaving everyone shaken.

"Qingyan, are you saying that the youth called Yang Kai killed that old fox Xu Zhishen? Did you see it with your own eyes?" In the family council hall the long-bearded elder seated in the central place asked slowly, his tone betraying disbelief.

This man was the Haike Family's current Family Head, Ian.

It wasn't that Ian was unwilling to believe Ba Qingyan, but this incident was simply too incredible. It would be plausible for Yang Kai to have slain a First Stage of the Saint King Realm, but what was Xu Zhishen? An elder of the Xu Family, one of their most powerful figures. Even facing him personally might not guarantee victory. If Xu Zhishen had deployed the Hundred Mountains Painting, Ian himself would have to flee.

If anyone else had made such claims Ian would have laughed it off, but it was Ba Qingyan who spoke.

Not only Ian but the ten or so elder-level figures in the hall all looked at Ba Qingyan with strange expressions.

"Old Ba, have you gone daft? Gathering us in broad daylight only to tell such a story—it's pointless," laughed an elder sitting to the left named Warren.

“That’s right, Elder Ba. If you wanted to tell a joke, I suggest you pick another one—this one isn’t funny at all.” Another woman, a voluptuous beauty, spoke with some displeasure. She was a guest elder of the Haike Family, named Huang Juan.

"Qingyan, speak carefully—I trust you are not one to confuse matters of weight and consequence!" Ian looked at Ba Qingyan.

Ba Qingyan's expression did not change; he knew what he said sounded like madness. If someone else had told him this he would not have believed them either. He paid the taunts no mind and waved to those behind him, "Bring them in."

A dozen or so people entered in single file; many were members of the Haike Family's younger generation who had accompanied Ba Qingyan to Dragon Lair Mountain. Upon entering they all bowed.

The elders and guest elders present had no idea what Ba Qingyan was planning, but none of them spoke. They simply sat in silence, waiting to hear what he would say next.

"Wu Ke, recount exactly what you witnessed today to the Family Head and the elders—no concealment and no embellishment, or you'll answer to family law!" Ba Qingyan said evenly.

Wu Ke quickly cupped his fists and acknowledged the order, then began recounting in detail how Xu Zhishen had led the Xu Family to Dragon Lair Mountain, where they clashed with Yang Kai and a great battle ensued. The young man’s eloquence was impressive—though he hadn’t understood much at the time, his vivid description practically recreated the entire scene.

Upon hearing that Wu Yi and Yu Feng had severed ties with the family to shelter Yang Kai and had opposed Ba Qingyan, many elders' faces darkened and they urged the Family Head to send someone to bring the girl back for family punishment as a warning.

Yet they quickly dropped that insistence. Yang Kai had stolen Xu Zhishen's Shadow Soul Threads and instantly erased Xu Zhishen's soul imprint, forcing him to use the Hundred Mountains Painting. Even after summoning six mountain-phantoms and the layered protections of four of them, Xu Zhishen was still consumed by a cloud of black flame and burned to death, and then Yang Kai ascended terrifyingly to the Saint King Realm...

All the elders and guest elders sat stunned, barely daring to believe their ears.

They had begun to suspect something because they had felt anomalies in the Spiritual Qi just now. Dragon Lair Mountain was not far from here, so some had sensed it though they had not paid it much mind.

It turned out that commotion had been caused by a person's ascension into the Saint King Realm!

Wu Ke finished speaking. Ba Qingyan looked at the dozen or so people and asked, "Did Wu Ke speak a single falsehood?"

The dozen heads all shook. "No."

"You witnessed today's events with your own eyes?"

"Yes, Elders!" the crowd nodded.

"Very well, you may leave." Ba Qingyan waved, and after the dozen bowed they withdrew.
