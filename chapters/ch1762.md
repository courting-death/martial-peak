## Chapter 1762 — Blood Beast Army

Because of all these reasons, the original version of the Golden Blood Threads secret art—the Demon Blood Threads secret art—could hardly display its power within the Demon Blood Sect; in particular, many of its variations required an enormous number of blood threads to sustain them, and no one in the Demon Blood Sect could meet that demand.

One could say the martial artist who devised this art only proposed a beautiful concept and could not truly perfect it.

Yang Kai was different; this secret art seemed tailor-made for him! In a sense, if the amount of Golden Blood in Yang Kai's body was sufficient, he could wield the Golden Blood Threads secret art to a degree the original creator could not have imagined.

As for the Blood Beast secret art, up until now he had only condensed two. It was on Yao Star Di Chen, after slaying Evil-Eyed Young Master Mi Tian's two Thunderflame Flying Lizards, that he condensed them; the Thunderflame Flying Lizard was only a Ninth-Tier demonic beast and could not play a large role for the present Yang Kai, so he never used them in battle.

Only when Blood Beasts reached a certain number could they form a truly considerable killing force.

One or two Blood Beasts formed from Ninth-Tier demonic beasts could not threaten a Void King, but if there were dozens, or a hundred… even a Void King might have to hold back.

Ninth-Tier demonic beasts were not easy to find, and Yang Kai had not taken condensing Blood Beasts too seriously, but in this Lost Realm he found it comparatively easy; it was a paradise for high-tier demonic beasts, and each of them carried ancient bloodlines—truly the best place to condense Blood Beasts.

So he did not shrink from it and directly used Golden Blood Threads to condense Blood Beasts.

After all, this was not his greatest trump card; even if it were exposed it would not matter.

Seeing Yang Kai had settled things, Ni Guang nodded again and said little, produced the Secret Treasure capable of probing spatial rifts, and took the lead.

The Lost Realm was full of peril, yet its opportunities were extraordinarily abundant.

There were many spirit flowers and strange herbs long extinct elsewhere, and countless ancient demonic beasts that had vanished from history; under the Lost Realm's special heaven-and-earth laws they still flourished.

The four of them—although two at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm reduced the group's average combat strength—were, overall, undeniably powerful.

Along the way toward where the Medicine Valley lay, they occasionally reaped rewards.

As Yang Kai had predicted, they encountered all manner of high-tier demonic beasts here. It could not be said Ninth-Tier demonic beasts were everywhere, but since entering Yang Kai had not seen anything below the Eighth-Tier.

They even ran into two Tenth-Tier demonic beasts; both emanated extraordinarily powerful auras. One of them made even Ni Guang feel wary and had to be kept at a distance. They dared not provoke it, but the other was unlucky and was killed by the four together.

Anything valuable from slain demonic beasts—Inner Core, gallbladder, talons, teeth—was taken by Ni Guang and Xue Yue; after all, Ninth- and Tenth-Tier beast materials were already quite valuable and there was no reason to pass them by, and Luo Lan also received some beast materials as spoils.

Yang Kai desired nothing else; he continuously used Golden Blood Threads to consume the beasts' blood-and-flesh essence to condense his own Blood Beasts and enlarge their ranks.

In only a few days, Yang Kai's Blood Beast army had swelled to more than a dozen. Among those was even the Tenth-Tier demonic beast they had slain together—the Steel-Flame Ghost Spider!

This demonic beast's body defense was extremely formidable, its form shrouded in a pale spirit flame that could burn all things; Origin Returning Realm warriors who touched it died on the spot. If not for Ni Guang's intervention, the other three alone likely would not have been able to slay it.

This could be called the single greatest Blood Beast Yang Kai had acquired.

Apart from the Steel-Flame Ghost Spider, ancient demonic beasts bearing various strange bloodlines—such as Zhugen Bird, Star-Emperor Turtle, Eight-Eyed Demon Toad, and the Thunder-Soul Purple-Sky Leopard—were all taken into Yang Kai's command.

On the surface it appeared that Yang Kai had gained nothing, but fundamentally he had profited more than anyone else.

What he gained was an increase in his own strength; what others obtained were merely external items, and turning external items into strength required an additional process.

After a few days together, Ni Guang and Luo Lan began to be astonished.

They discovered Yang Kai's Golden Blood Threads seemed inexhaustible. When he dealt with the first Tail-Crested Snake corpse, Ni Guang had not paid it much mind—a single Blood Beast condensed from one Golden Blood Thread, he truly did not regard it highly.

But now the Blood Beasts Yang Kai had gathered were enough to move him.

Releasing more than a dozen such Blood Beasts at once would give even him a headache.

And judging by the looks of it, this was far from Yang Kai's limit.

Ni Guang found it hard to imagine what the scene would be if Yang Kai amassed a sufficient number of these bizarre Blood Beasts.

He finally began to take Yang Kai seriously.

On the road he occasionally used Divine Sense to communicate with Xue Yue, attempting to probe Yang Kai's background and see whether they could recruit him into the Hengluo Commerce Guild.

Xue Yue did not know much either, so she could not give a definite answer at once, but she too developed the notion of inviting Yang Kai to join.

A few days later Yang Kai's Blood Beast force had reached over twenty; the army had taken shape. Now, when they encountered demonic beasts there was no need for Ni Guang and the others to intervene—once Yang Kai's Blood Beast army moved, they could quickly surround and beat enemies to death, and his gains began to snowball.

That day Ni Guang, who was leading the way, suddenly stopped, frowned, and probed the surroundings; his Divine Sense expanded outward.

"Uncle Ni, what's wrong?" Xue Yue looked left and right and, finding no traces of danger, asked in puzzlement.

"Someone is coming." Ni Guang's eyes flashed; he looked in a direction and said in a deep voice, "Very fast."

Hearing that, everyone could not help but change color and followed his gaze.

Soon, Yang Kai and Luo Lan also sensed the disturbance in that direction. From a great distance away, they could feel the aura of living beings rapidly approaching. Judging from the fluctuations of that aura, the newcomers were clearly Void King Realm experts—and not just one, but two of them!

In a moment, two streaks of light appeared before them.

Whether by design or by chance, those two were heading straight for the place where Yang Kai and the others stood.

In very little time the distance between the parties shrank quickly.

At this point Ni Guang recognized them; his face turned cold. "Hmph, of all people, these two!"

"It's them!" Luo Lan also changed color and showed unmistakable apprehension toward the newcomers.

Yang Kai frowned silently as well; before entering, Xue Yue had introduced the Void King Realm experts who had been present, so he also recognized their origins.

Of the two, one was a slightly aged elder, the other a middle-aged man, yet neither appeared to be a good person.

The elder was named Kong Fa, an elder of the Spine of the Star River.

The Spine of the Star River was a force within the Star Domain, but like the other force—the Abandoned Nest—it was notorious! Both gathered mostly people who did all manner of evil; many cultivators who had run afoul of the law on various Cultivation Stars had no choice but to go there.

Their favorite deed was to roam the Star Domain and plunder any lone warship they encountered.

They were truly the Star Domain's bandits! Whether the Sword Alliance, Purple Star, or the Hengluo Commerce Guild, over countless years they had suffered at the hands of these two forces; many long-range warships had vanished without trace, their accompanying warriors and supplies never to be found.

Although there was little concrete evidence proving all such acts were done by these two forces, everyone knew that those who dared act so wantonly were very likely these lawless people.

The people of the Spine of the Star River and the Abandoned Nest were despised and discarded by the Star Domain.

Simply robbing warships was not the worst of it—the two forces sometimes sent cadres to Cultivation Stars without Void King Realm guardians and plundered cultivation supplies and cultivators, dragging them back to their headquarters to enslave and abuse.

The Spine of the Star River and the Abandoned Nest could be called the two great cancers of the Star Domain!

Yet because their strength was not weak, they could not be eliminated.

Previously Xue Yue had warned Yang Kai that Kong Fa from the Spine of the Star River was not a good man; if he met him alone in future he should take care.

For though this man appeared amiable, in truth he was ruthless to the extreme.

The middle-aged man who had come with Kong Fa was Xu Wei, an elder of the Abandoned Nest, another cancer of the Star Domain.

Rumor had it he had once come from Purple Star but for some unknown reason had betrayed it and fallen into the Abandoned Nest.

Before his betrayal he had slaughtered everyone of his own sect, leaving none alive.

The matter had once shocked Purple Star; Purple Star had even sent experts to pursue him, but Xu Wei had carved a bloody path and escaped into the Abandoned Nest.

The incident had brought great shame to Purple Star.

Years later he had gained a foothold in the Abandoned Nest and risen to the rank of elder.

The two were birds of a feather; no one knew how they had come to collaborate, nor why they were flying toward Ni Guang's direction.

After recognizing the two, Ni Guang not only showed no fear but instead let out a series of cold laughs. “Very well. Outside, this old man couldn’t act rashly, but since you’ve come here courting death, I’ll grant you your wish! Elder Luo, in a moment I’ll ask you to hold one of them off. I’ll kill the other first, then come join you.”

"Leave it to me!" Luo Lan's pretty face grew cold. "The Sword Alliance has many grievances with these two; now that we've met them here, there's no reason to let them go."

"Both of you stay a little farther back and protect yourselves!" Ni Guang ordered Yang Kai and Xue Yue.

Yang Kai and Xue Yue both nodded and prepared to withdraw.

Four Void King Realm experts were about to erupt into a massive battle; that would be a world-shaking fight, and Yang Kai had no desire to be swept up in it.
