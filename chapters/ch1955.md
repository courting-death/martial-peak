## Chapter 1955 — Backlash

The more Yang Kai thought about it, the more he believed this was possible.

Yang Kai did not know exactly how powerful Ice Heart Valley's founding ancestor Bing Yun had been, but long ago Ice Heart Valley had been a major sect that shook the Star Domain, no weaker than the three great powers—Hengluo Commerce Guild, the Sword Alliance, and Purple Star.

Only because so much time had passed and the disciples had proved unworthy had Ice Heart Valley gradually fallen into desolation; even so, there were still Void King Realm warriors stationed within the valley.

Whoever could found such a sect could hardly have been weak; this sect had endured for ten thousand, perhaps twenty thousand years.

If Bing Yun had long since left the Star Domain and reached the Star Realm, that would explain matters.

And the Snow Like Clear Sky secret technique the Yao Worm Matriarch manifested was absolutely connected to Bing Yun; one could even say the formation of this Ice Cliff was very likely inseparable from Bing Yun.

If Bing Yun were still alive, given her age and aptitude, reaching the Emperor realm would not have been difficult. The lingering profound intent here also matched the ice-based methods and secret techniques cultivated by Ice Heart Valley's lineage.

Yang Kai gradually pieced together the thread of events, though whether it was the true truth he could not be sure; at the very least, his conjecture explained why Snow Like Clear Sky had appeared in the Star Realm.

With sword light constantly striking from behind, Yang Kai soon noticed a sign that eased him somewhat: the Yao Worm Matriarch pursuing him seemed to know only that one move, Snow Like Clear Sky. It could not employ other secret techniques; all its killing moves were evolutions based on Snow Like Clear Sky.

This made Yang Kai overjoyed; after all, if that were so, he would have room to maneuver and a chance to deal with it.

Fortunately he was adept in spatial power, and cultivators skilled in that force were renowned for excellence at fleeing—killing such a practitioner was actually very difficult.

Whether in the Star Domain or the Star Realm it was the same: cultivators most avoided provoking people like Yang Kai. Spatial Force let them come and go without a trace; unless one could secure a kill in a single blow, endless trouble would follow.

Therefore, once cultivators offended such an enemy, the most reliable solutions were only two: kill swiftly, or reconcile and make peace! Otherwise the unlucky party would surely be themselves.

Climbing up from the cliff bottom, Yang Kai several times hovered at the brink of death; because he could not use Divine Sense, he did not know how strong the Yao Worm Matriarch truly was, only that it was far beyond what he could contend with now, so he abandoned thoughts of fighting and aimed only to escape.

But the Yao Worm Matriarch seemed crazed, clinging like maggot to bone and pursuing Yang Kai without relent; despite its enormous bulk its twists and turns displayed uncanny agility, and its leaping along the Ice Cliff's wall was in no way slower than Yang Kai's.

Only after the time it took a stick of incense to burn did Yang Kai shoot out of the Ice Cliff like a cannonball and fall onto a nearby peak, and only then did he finally catch his breath.

With the dense Imperial Might and the crushing influence of the ice-cold law below gone, and no longer facing the Yao Worm Matriarch's innate advantage, the situation at last looked less dire.

He shifted his spirit, concentrated, and drew a light breath.

The next moment, a vast snow-white figure trailed closely and landed some ten or so zhang in front of Yang Kai.

Observing the Yao Worm Matriarch from the summit, its features grew ever clearer; the hideous visage made Yang Kai's scalp tingle. When his Divine Sense swept across it, the rising energy fluctuations pouring from the creature were by no means inferior to Bian Yuqing's—if anything, they seemed to exceed hers.

"Emperor realm?" Yang Kai exclaimed, his face paling.

Even if this Yao Worm Matriarch was not an Emperor-level demonic beast, it was probably not far off, standing two Realms above Yang Kai.

To struggle with such an enemy was akin to courting death! Yang Kai could not help but feel somewhat relieved that he had not been finished off at the cliff bottom.

Just as cold sweat streamed down Yang Kai's brow and would not stop, he suddenly discovered something extremely strange—this Yao Worm Matriarch seemed to show no trace of life, not even a sign of Qi and blood flowing within.

"Dead?" Yang Kai could not help but furrow his brow.

No life fluctuations, no sign of Qi and blood flowing; this proved the Yao Worm Matriarch was a dead thing. But how could a dead thing be so agile? How could it even manifest a Sword Dao secret technique like Snow Like Clear Sky?

Yet that also explained why it showed the powerful energy fluctuations of the Emperor realm but could not easily kill Yang Kai: as a dead object it could not exert the full power an Emperor should wield.

Yang Kai examined it more closely and suddenly saw a clear wound on its abdomen, as if cut by sword Qi through the body; the wound was a sheet of ice crystals exposing the internal organs, yet bizarrely no blood flowed.

It truly was a dead thing! Could it be like the Corpse Spirit Race—its soul not extinguished and revived by the special environment at the Ice Cliff's base?

Since encountering the Yao Worm Matriarch Yang Kai had harbored many questions, but he had no time to probe them, for after it surged up it quickly launched its attack.

The long sword of manifested energy traced a circle on its pincer; where the blade pointed, a fierce force erupted.

Suddenly, snow began to fall from the sky—flakes as large as goose feathers—and in an instant the world was wrapped in a silver-white cloak.

Howling cold winds swept forth, centered on the Yao Worm Matriarch; within ten li every inch was shrouded by an indescribable ice-cold. In that space it seemed all laws ceased to exist, leaving only cold.

And here, the Yao Worm Matriarch was the master!

This was the control over the Power of the Laws wielded by an Emperor-level expert: with a single thought seas changed to mulberry fields, with a single thought stars were shifted and moons exchanged.

Yang Kai's face changed drastically; he desperately mobilized his power to resist, yet his teeth still chattered and his whole body trembled. Earlier at the cliff bottom he had taken a blow; although he used Nothingness to neutralize the lethal harm, he had not entirely avoided it and was badly injured. Now, with the opponent's sword intent unleashed, matters only worsened.

The Yao Worm Matriarch's eyes gleamed an eerie snow-white, its mouth letting out a sharp, grating cry. As it cried, the icy sword intent increasingly drew the nearby heavenly-and-earthly laws to flow, making the peak—previously not so cold—now more unbearable than the cliff bottom.

Yang Kai's face sank like water; he realized he had gotten into serious trouble.

He could indeed fight above his grade, but there were limits. Facing a Yao Worm Matriarch that likely possessed Emperor cultivation and was masterful in a single Sword Dao secret technique, even the greatest skill could not stir a ripple.

He could almost foresee that when the opponent's sword fell, it would be the moment his soul was scattered.

At the critical moment he frantically drove his spatial power to teleport away, but to his despair the surrounding space had already been sealed by the ice-cold law; his spatial secret technique could not work at all.

The Yao Worm Matriarch's white-glowing eyes emitted a cruel light; its long sword was raised high, the Power of the Laws wreathing the blade.

On the brink of life and death, a flash of insight struck Yang Kai; he hurriedly summoned an item, poured all his strength into it, and hurled it at the Yao Worm Matriarch.

The object was a bracelet-like secret treasure; countless grain-sized rune patterns on the bracelet flickered, containing a thick current of Imperial Might.

When Yang Kai threw the bracelet the Yao Worm Matriarch at first paid it no heed, but as the bracelet struck and the tiny runes glowed, a natural suppressive force enveloped its body and the Yao Worm Matriarch suddenly let out a shrill cry.

Its eyes trembled violently as it stared at the bracelet with terror, like a mouse seeing a cat; its massive body quivered slightly.

That bracelet seemed to have a natural countering effect against the Yao Worm Matriarch.

Clang...

The bracelet struck the Yao Worm Matriarch's forehead; though Yang Kai had thrown with great force and such an attack was obviously not fatal, the bracelet's inherent might struck the Yao Worm Matriarch like thunder.

The ice-cold profound intent that had shrouded heaven and earth suddenly unraveled; the goose-feather sized snow flakes drifting from the sky transformed into razor blades, wildly lashing out in all directions.

Yang Kai's face went pale; how could he remain? He immediately summoned the Xuan Realm Pearl and hid entirely inside it.

At the very instant Yang Kai vanished, a sudden, thunderous hum exploded out; the raging, ice‑cold profound intent rolled back in a torrent, pouring into the Yao Worm Matriarch's body and erupting within it in rapid succession.

Boom, boom, boom...

The Yao Worm Matriarch's body scattered, flesh flying—no blood was seen—but that snow-white form was riddled with holes in the blink of an eye, and even the energy longsword formed on its pincer dissolved.

Backlash!

To unleash such a refined Sword Dao secret technique only to have it disrupted at the crucial moment caused the technique's full might to recoil upon the Yao Worm Matriarch, letting it taste the terrifying killing power of its own art.

Rumble...

Above the Ice Cliff, the ice rock was shredded and scattered by overflowing sword Qi; the entire peak seemed shaved down a layer. One could imagine that had Yang Kai still been there, even if he had deployed every defensive method, he could not have withstood such might—only death would have followed.

A cascade of clattering sounds rose up as fractured ice and rock tumbled down the Ice Cliff, smashing against the cliff face below in relentless succession.

Only after thirty breaths did the disturbance atop the Ice Cliff gradually subside.

Only then did Yang Kai flash and reappear from the Xuan Realm Pearl.

The scene before him made him swallow involuntarily; he secretly thanked his luck that he had fled quickly.

When he looked again at the Yao Worm Matriarch, Yang Kai was pleased to find the creature lying motionless; the body that had already borne a fatal wound was now in tatters—clearly dead beyond doubt.

A snow-white light suddenly rose from the Yao Worm Matriarch; it twisted slightly and condensed directly into the shape of a long sword.

That form bore a striking resemblance—about seventy to eighty percent—to Su Yan's Profound Frost Divine Sword.

"What the hell is that?" Yang Kai frowned and moved to examine it closely, but the snow-white light shot straight at him, and in an instant the ice-cold descended upon him, chilling him to the bone.

But that sensation could not compare to the pressure the Yao Worm Matriarch had exerted on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai gritted his teeth and summoned the Xuan Realm Pearl; vast Divine Sense burst from his Sea of Consciousness like a tide, enveloped the snow-white light, and he hissed, "Get in!"

The next moment, the snow-white light wrapped by Yang Kai's Divine Sense was pulled into the Xuan Realm Pearl.
