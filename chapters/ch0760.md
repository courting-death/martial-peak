## Chapter 760 — Slaughtering a Million Corpses After Death

While they spoke, Yang Kai had already reached them and dashed straight to An Ling'er’s side, frowning as he looked at her.

An Ling'er was crying with wet lashes; she glanced at Yang Kai and cried out in alarm, “Why are you here? Why aren't you leaving?”

“I can't leave!” Yang Kai shook his head slowly, his expression grave. “That woman has placed a divine-intent lock on me.”

An Ling'er covered her mouth, her beautiful eyes trembling; she looked at Yang Kai with a touch of sympathy and pity.

“Who is she? Why is she targeting me? Does this have anything to do with you people?” Yang Kai’s expression grew angry as he fired off several questions in succession.

“You're… the kid who hitched a ride before?” Qian Ning gave Yang Kai a sidelong look, his face sour. With this turn of events the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was already in a bad state; Yang Kai suddenly appearing and rattling off questions made Qian Ning’s irritation flare. He waved a hand, “Get lost — this is no place for you to speak.”

As he spoke, a burst of True Yuan suddenly slammed toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's face turned cold; he made no effort to hide his strength. With a casual sweep he shattered Qian Ning’s attack, standing unmoved, as calm as clouds.

“Huh?” Qian Ning was stunned, appraising Yang Kai from head to toe. He hadn’t expected this unremarkable-looking youth to defuse his attack so effortlessly.

“I don't intend to be your enemy. I only want to know why that woman is after me.” Yang Kai, clearly impatient, glanced coldly at Qian Ning to state his position, then fixed his gaze on An Ling'er.

“Uncle Qian…” An Ling'er raised a hand to stop Qian Ning’s agitation, then forced a wry smile at Yang Kai. “You being targeted is your own doing.”

“How so?”

“Probably because you learned the Nine Heavens Divine Technique.”

At those words, the Transcendent Realm experts from the Nine Heavens Sacred Land went pale, staring at Yang Kai in disbelief; Qian Ning was dumbfounded. He looked at Yang Kai, then at An Ling'er, and blurted out, “He… how could he have learned the Nine Heavens Divine Technique?”

The Nine Heavens Divine Technique was always reserved for the highest ranks within the Sacred Land; even Qian Ning had never mastered it.

“You're courting death!” Yang Kai's face suddenly twisted into a ferocious snarl.

He had not expected An Ling'er to reveal such a grave secret in front of so many people; once exposed, this secret forced him into opposition with the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

“So what.” An Ling'er managed a bitter smile. “We're going to die anyway — letting them know changes nothing.”

“Miss, what is going on?” Qian Ning hurriedly asked, his face shocked and suspicious; it was clear he had already formed some guesses.

“Just as you think.” An Ling'er wiped her tears and said softly, “The man before you passed my test—he comprehended three moves of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique in one go!”

Everyone’s faces were frozen with astonishment, their eyes nearly popping out.

After a long pause Qian Ning seemed to regain his senses and asked with difficulty, “Then… wouldn't he be the perfect candidate for the Saint Lord?”

“Indeed.” An Ling'er nodded faintly.

The others looked at Yang Kai with altered expressions, now full of reverence and expectation.

“But it's already too late. Grandmother Nan has already found this place…” An Ling'er gave a bitter laugh, and at her words Qian Ning and the others' faces suddenly darkened.

“I don't care about your Saint Lord titles. You need to explain this to me. Who is that woman? You should know her, right?” Yang Kai suppressed his murderous intent for the moment and pointed at the woman hovering coldly in midair, staring their way.

Since An Ling'er had already exposed the secret, blaming her now was pointless. Yang Kai only wanted to know what godlike figure had suddenly appeared, why she was quietly slaughtering mortals, and why she had placed a divine intent lock on him.

“It's Grandmother Nan!” An Ling'er answered softly.

“Grandmother Nan?”

“She was the last surviving Saintess of the previous generation in the Sacred Land!”

Yang Kai gaped in astonishment. “Has there been some internal strife in the Nine Heavens Sacred Land? Why would a Saintess of the previous generation be hostile toward you?”

An Ling'er shook her head in pain. “Grandmother Nan treated me well — there wasn't internal conflict… Uh, do you remember something I told you?”

“What?”

“As the Saintess of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, in life she killed no one!”

“How does that relate to the present?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled.

“That was only the first half — there’s a second half…” An Ling'er's voice trembled, betraying her terror as she murmured, “In life she killed no one; in death she slaughtered millions!”

Yang Kai's expression went blank as he frowned, “What kind of phrase is that?”

“The Saintess of the Sacred Land truly wouldn't kill any living being while alive, but once dead, if her body isn't promptly destroyed, she falls onto the Path of Asura and slaughters every life that can perceive her. It's a flaw of our cultivation method.” An Ling'er drew a breath. “So after each Saintess dies, their body is immediately cremated to prevent precisely this; Grandmother Nan was fine before we set out — how could she suddenly be like this now…”

Yang Kai suddenly understood; no wonder he had felt a faint deathly aura from that woman. If An Ling'er’s explanation was correct, then this Grandmother Nan, the previous Saintess, must already be a corpse.

Dead people can still act — Yang Kai had seen that before.

The Coffin-Bearer was an undead. He had long since passed away, yet a lingering obsession in his heart, coupled with formidable cultivation and will, sustained him; even in death he continued to fulfill his duty of seeking someone to free the Ancient Demon Clan.

If so, then the Saintess Nan must also possess a powerful obsession in her heart; otherwise she couldn't sustain her current actions.

“Saintess Nan was united in purpose with the Saint Lord — perhaps the Saint Lord fell, and so Saintess Nan…” Qian Ning sighed heavily.

“What has your Nine Heavens Sacred Land been doing, letting such a dangerous person roam free?” Yang Kai exploded in anger. Being targeted by someone at Saint Realm made him feel as if death hovered over him constantly.

“What good is saying that now?” An Ling'er shot him a look. “Because she cultivated the same technique, Grandmother Nan came after me. If the people on these nearby isles can't resist her they'll all die. After killing me she'd go after my three sisters. Only when she herself is destroyed will her slaughtering stop—until then any living thing she meets will be her enemy.”

The most powerful of the nearby isles was only Qian Ning — a mere Third Stage of the Transcendent Realm, utterly incapable of standing against a former Saintess at Saint Realm.

“No matter what, Miss and the future Saint Lord must not come to harm!” Qian Ning’s expression hardened as he solemnly faced Yang Kai. “Brother, although you haven't entered the Sacred Land, since you passed Miss's test you will sooner or later become its master. Please take Miss away at once; if it cannot be done, you must at least survive. Miss will use her life to protect you.”

Yang Kai was indifferent. Though Qian Ning's words tugged at him, he could never be the Saint Lord of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

Qian Ning's speech was like casting pearls before swine.

“You two, leave at once — we'll hold them off here!”

"You overestimate yourselves!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. "You're asking for death. Besides, where could she and I possibly flee to? There's nowhere nearby at all…"

Before he finished speaking, Yang Kai's eyes brightened as he suddenly thought of a possibility and looked toward a certain point far out at sea.

An Ling'er seemed to think of the same thing; their eyes met and each saw the other's thought.

As they conversed, Saintess Nan watched coldly from the sky, not yet striking; hesitation flickered across her face, the remnants of reason from her life holding her back — though it wouldn't hold for long, and a cold killing intent began to seep from her.

“Little brother, if you die that's one thing, but if you live, please become the Saint Lord of the Sacred Land — the Sacred Land must not stand a day without a master!” Qian Ning patted Yang Kai's shoulder and warned him earnestly.

Yang Kai had no reply.

“Go — run as far as you can!” Qian Ning drew a deep breath, then abruptly looked up at Saintess Nan in the sky.

Her expression shifted constantly; gradually the hesitation was replaced by ferocity, the killing intent thick as a storm. The overseas isles instantly became a hellish place, wind and chill howling.

Yang Kai did not hesitate. He grabbed An Ling'er, his Wind-and-Thunder Wings unfurling, and they streaked away like lightning.

As they moved, Saintess Nan waved a fair hand and unleashed attacks that fell like a torrential downpour.

Qian Ning and the other Nine Heavens Sacred Land experts faced her with grave expressions.

“Uncle Qian and the others…” An Ling'er called back anxiously.

“They're doomed.” Yang Kai's expression was grave. Speeding a little faster, he dove down to the sea; True Yuan flowed around them, wrapping both as they plunged beneath the waves.

While descending, Yang Kai stole a glance upward and just saw Qian Ning and the others explode into blood mist in midair.

They hadn't lasted three breaths under Saintess Nan’s onslaught.

Even after cutting down Qian Ning and the others, Saintess Nan would not relent. The Xuantian Sword in her hand sliced through the islands where Qian Ning's group had stood, tearing up chunks of land that sank into the sea — a scene of slaughter and countless dead.

In the next instant she hurled the massive Xuantian Sword, its force like a rainbow, cleaving through the sea’s resistance to chase after Yang Kai and An Ling'er.

A cold sweat ran over Yang Kai as his True Yuan surged wildly; he pushed his speed to the limit, but the giant sword bore onward through the water as if unimpeded, splitting the deep blue sea in two.
