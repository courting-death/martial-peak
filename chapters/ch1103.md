## Chapter 1103 — Formation

Yang Flame’s features looked innocent enough, but Yang Kai had never been close to her, so he naturally wouldn’t be so naive as to take her words at face value.

“You’re an Origin-Grade artificer — how did you end up in such a sorry state?”

“Because nobody believes me.” Yang Flame pouted her bright, crimson lips in grievance. “No one dares to bring me high-tier Secret Treasures to temper. Those who come are only bringing trash, so the payment I get is naturally very little.”

“I just heard in the Refining Pavilion’s hall that you reduced someone’s Saint King-Grade, Upper-Level Secret Treasure down to Saint King-Grade, Middle-Level?” Yang Kai regarded her with a strange look.

“Yep.” To Yang Kai’s surprise, Yang Flame actually nodded and admitted it, waving her hands as she spoke: “That fellow’s cultivation is only Third Stage of the Saint Realm — with that realm the tool can’t exert its full power. Saint King-Grade, Middle-Level is essentially his floor. I lowered the treasure’s grade, but when he fights his combat effectiveness will increase. If he comes back when his cultivation has improved, the treasure’s grade can be raised again.”

“I also heard you forged the longsword he asked for into a cleaver…”

“What does he know? His method, his Martial Skill, even his Saint Yuan attribute are all of the wide-and-forceful type. A longsword is too elegant; it can’t bring out his strengths. A cleaver is the true path. After he uses it for a while he’ll see my good intentions — then he’ll be grateful to me.”

Yang Kai sighed. He didn’t know whether to trust her. If she spoke the truth, then she truly was an Origin-Grade artificer — an exceedingly rare talent, especially given her age.

Precisely because she was so young, appearing even younger than Yang Kai, it made sense nobody would believe she was an Origin-Grade artificer.

The truth and falsehood of it all, Yang Kai couldn’t sort out.

“Yang Flame, you can’t do this. A artificer’s priority is to meet the cultivator’s own needs, not to impose your ideas when tempering a Secret Treasure. You’re not them — how can you know what they want most? Acting on your own like this is bound to cause problems.”

Yang Flame looked even more aggrieved and stammered, “But I can’t stand to see good materials wasted.”

Yang Kai shook his head and said no more.

Before long the two arrived at the cave entrance on Dragon Lair Mountain. When they disembarked, Yang Kai was surprised to find Yu Feng leading a group of people in and out of the cavern, as if transporting something.

Seeing Yang Kai arrive, Yu Feng grinned broadly and ran over, patting Yang Kai on the shoulder in a friendly way. “I heard from the miss that you’re staying?”

“Mm.”

“Staying’s good. You haven’t any family on Dark Star — stay and join the miss in making a name for yourself, you can bring honor to your clan. The miss had us arrange the cave for you; the brothers are all busy.” Yu Feng pointed at the cultivators going in and out; they were all the warriors who had been on the warship.

He took out a Spatial Ring and handed it to Yang Kai. “This is the ring you used to wear. Inside is a little something from the brothers — everyone chipped in. From now on we’re family. It’s not much, don’t spurn it.”

Yang Kai took it, scanned it with Divine Sense, and found a few hundred Lower-Level Saint Crystals and several bottles of common Healing Pills inside. It wasn’t much, nowhere near what he had been robbed of, but Yang Kai accepted it solemnly and nodded in thanks.

Only then did Yu Feng seem to notice Yang Flame’s presence. He gasped and stared at her with lascivious humor. “You’re really something, kid — you brought back a woman in such little time? Where did you find her? Not bad, tell your brother and I’ll go look too.”

Yang Flame’s expression chilled and she glared at Yu Feng hard.

Yu Feng instantly laughed awkwardly.

Yang Kai explained, “This is Master Yang Flame.”

“Master?” Yu Feng was taken aback. “What master?”

“I brought her back from the Refining Pavilion. She’s skilled in refining and is here to help me set up an array.”

At the words ‘artificer’, Yu Feng’s lecherous grin disappeared and his demeanor turned respectful. He measured Yang Flame up and down, cupped his fists, and said, “I — Yu — was rude. Miss, please forgive me.”

Yu Feng saw that although she seemed frivolous and unreliable, the role of a artificer was honored. Even if Yang Flame looked young, he dared not treat her lightly. Nobody could be sure she wouldn’t prove to be an outstanding artificer later; he might need to seek her help someday.

Yang Flame’s face softened slightly and she offered a small nod.

Yu Feng continued, “Miss, since you’re a artificer, could you forge a Secret Treasure for me?”

“Sure.” Yang Flame’s eyes brightened and she agreed readily. “What grade? What type of Secret Treasure do you want?”

“You two talk… I’ll go inside and take a look!” Yang Kai couldn’t bear to see Yu Feng’s expectant expression and used the excuse to slip into the cave.

Inside the cavern many cultivators came and went, busy as could be. After months on the warship Yang Kai had gotten on reasonably well with these people — some were familiar and others simply recognizable. Under Wu Yi’s orders they were helping to tidy the cave for Yang Kai and showed no reluctance, instead behaving with warmth.

People kept greeting Yang Kai and he replied with thanks to each.

Walking around the cave made Yang Kai’s heart feel a little warmer.

The cavern had been completely transformed. In the stone chamber Yang Kai chose as his bedroom there were beds, chairs, and stools; the corridors were dotted with luminous stones to dispel the darkness, and other areas had been renovated so the passages were wider and more livable.

It was clear they had worked conscientiously. Some even slapped Yang Kai on the shoulder and told him that if he ever suffered injustice or was bullied, he should come to the Haike Family’s estate and they would stand up for him.

Yang Kai smiled and accepted.

After touring the cave and seeing the renovations, Yang Kai was pleased and stepped back outside.

Yu Feng stood there muttering to himself but Yang Flame was nowhere to be seen.

“Where did that woman go?” Yang Kai asked as he approached.

“Oh, she said she’d scout the local terrain and would be back soon.” Yu Feng replied casually, then his face soured. “Yang Kai, I asked her to forge a Spirit-Grade Secret Treasure. I gathered all the materials — why did she charge me fifty Lower-Level Saint Crystals? Isn’t that a bit steep?”

“You get what you pay for!” Yang Kai patted his shoulder and said earnestly, “Take it. You went to her. It’s too late to change your mind now.”

Yu Feng lamented, “I should’ve gone to the Refining Pavilion in Tianyun City — it would’ve cost half. What a loss. Oh well, look at that girl’s poor, destitute look. Consider me pitying her and help her business. I just hope she doesn’t ruin my Secret Treasure.”

“She won’t ruin it — but who knows what she’ll actually make? By the way, why do you need a Spirit-Grade Secret Treasure?” Yang Kai asked, puzzled. Yu Feng was a First Stage of the Saint King Realm warrior; a Spirit-Grade treasure was useless to him — such tools were for True Yuan Realm or Divine Roaming Realm cultivators.

“To give to a little fellow.” Yu Feng grinned widely.

After a while Yang Flame did return.

Without a word she pulled paper and pen from her Spatial Ring and began to sketch, brow furrowing as she fell into thought. Yang Kai and Yu Feng stood aside and didn’t interrupt.

After a cup of tea Yang Flame looked at her work, nodded with satisfaction, and handed the paper to Yang Kai. “Alter the nearby terrain according to these markings. With so many of you working together it’ll only take a day.”

Yang Kai took the paper and peered at it with Yu Feng.

Yu Feng couldn’t make much of it, but Yang Kai was struck dumb — he immediately realized Yang Flame had real talent. Regardless of her refining skill, in the art of arrays she was far superior to him.

If they reshaped the terrain according to those marks the array would be much easier to set and, once complete, the effect would be far more remarkable.

“Understood.” Yang Kai put the drawing away and looked at Yu Feng. “I’ll trouble you all for a day’s work.”

Yu Feng boisterously replied, “No need for thanks. Since the miss told us to help, we’ll make it the best. Wait here — I’ll call the others.”

After Yu Feng left, Yang Flame asked, “You can read the markings, right?”

Seeing Yang Kai nod, she inclined her head. “Then you go command them. I’ll first forge what’s needed. Hmm, hand me the materials.”

Yang Kai took out the materials he had purchased and handed them over.

Yu Feng led a group out of the cave and Yang Kai explained the tasks to be done; everyone agreed without issue.

Dragon Lair Mountain bustled to life. Dozens of cultivators split into groups, digging ditches, leveling hills, and cutting surplus trees. They executed Yang Flame’s diagram with meticulous care.

These were no ordinary folk; they worked quickly. In less than a day the modifications were complete.

When everyone returned to the cave Yang Flame had finished her final preparations. She carried several oddly shaped items out and the group puzzled over what she intended to do.

She only nodded to Yang Kai, then flew off. The crowd watched her small figure dart through the hills, sometimes landing atop peaks as she hurried about.

Yu Feng scratched his head and asked in bewilderment, “Yang Kai, what kind of array are you arranging to require such big measures?”

“You’ll see soon enough.” Yang Kai wouldn’t reveal it, merely smiling as he waited.

He felt full of confidence in the array Yang Flame was setting up.

When Yang Flame reached the last peak and busied herself for a while, everyone saw her flutter up, standing midair and waving a tiny hand toward them.

“It’s done!” Yang Kai called softly, raising his hand in response. Yang Flame flew back quickly from over there.
