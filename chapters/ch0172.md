## Chapter 172 — Flattery

“Old man…” As Yang Kai opened his mouth, the elder made a gesture to him: “Don’t speak.”

Yang Kai frowned. Although he didn’t know what the old man was afraid of, it was undoubtedly related to the martial artists who had arrived.

Before long, the visitors had reached the door, knocking loudly on the dilapidated wooden door.

Xiao Yu was startled awake, trembling as she clutched her grandfather on the bed.

Yang Kai’s expression turned cold.

“Old man, open the door quickly!” came a furious shout from outside.

“If you don’t open the door, we won’t be polite!” a second voice followed.

The elder held his granddaughter tightly, a mix of anger and helplessness flashing in his murky eyes. He spoke softly to comfort her: “Xiao Yu, don’t be afraid. Grandpa is here. Don’t be scared!”

The people outside clearly had little patience. Seeing that the elder was unwilling to open the door, they kicked it open, the sea breeze rushing into the room and scattering the last remnants of warmth.

“Old man!” one of them barged in fiercely, “You’ve got some nerve to keep the door closed. Do you believe I’ll stab you with a knife?”

“What do you want! Get out!” the elder cried out, protecting his granddaughter. “Your group has already taken the child’s father, and the child’s mother has also been captured by you. It’s just the two of us left here, struggling to survive. Will you not let us be?”

“Heh heh, why speak so harshly, old man? We’ve invited their couple to Yunxia Island for a visit. Now they miss you, so we’re here to take you both along. A family should be together, after all.” The first man who entered grinned maliciously as he walked in, suddenly spotting Yang Kai and pausing in surprise.

He warily sized up Yang Kai, but not sensing any traces of a martial artist from the youth, he dismissed him as an ordinary person. He thought to himself that it was strange; when did this family add another person?

The elder cried, “We ordinary folks can’t enjoy such fortune! Please, can you let the child’s parents go back? She misses them dearly.”

“Old man, you’re being ungrateful!” the man’s expression turned cold. “Since you miss them, come with us. Once you reach Yunxia Island, you’ll have your reunion. What’s with the wailing here?”

From the moment these two martial artists entered the room, Yang Kai had already gleaned quite a bit of information.

He knew of Yunxia Island. There was a Yunxia Sect on the island, which was merely a third-rate power, inferior even to Lingxiao Pavilion.

However, Yang Kai didn’t understand why they had come here to capture people. Moreover, it seemed this wasn’t their first time.

The elder had mentioned before that Xiao Yu was unwilling to speak because something had happened at home, which should be related to this matter.

Yang Kai was not one to meddle in others’ affairs, but he had helped Cui’er and the others before because he had received their kindness. Now that this grandfather and granddaughter were in trouble, he wouldn’t turn a blind eye.

One must always be grateful for kindness. Xiao Yu’s pure and kind nature was enough to move him.

These two martial artists were only at the Qi Movement Realm, their abilities not particularly high. Yang Kai was confident he could easily handle them in a fight. However, this wasn’t the right place to act, especially since they had a sect backing them. If things went awry, it could implicate the elder and Xiao Yu.

He needed to devise a good plan.

“Please, I beg you both, let the child’s parents return so we can reunite as a family,” the elder pleaded, tears streaming down his face as he knelt on the bed, repeatedly bowing.

“Damn it, old man, your noise is driving me mad!” the Yunxia Sect martial artist cursed, looking ready to charge forward.

Yang Kai stepped in front of him.

“Kid, who are you?” the Yunxia Sect martial artist glared at Yang Kai, his anger boiling. He had wanted to ask this question for a while, but the old man had been so noisy upon entering that he hadn’t had the chance.

Yang Kai smiled, performing a respectful bow: “I am a distant relative of this family.”

“A distant relative?” The man looked at Yang Kai suspiciously but didn’t press further. “What are you doing here?”

Yang Kai quickly replied, “I’ve fallen on hard times in business. I intended to come here for refuge, but unexpectedly found that my uncle and aunt have already been taken to Yunxia Island by you two. It’s quite a surprise. I have long admired the Yunxia Sect and have always wished to become a disciple, but I’ve had no way in. Today, to see you two is truly a blessing from heaven. Might I ask you to take me along to Yunxia Island?”

Yang Kai’s voice was humble, and as he spoke, he expressed a nervous anticipation while appropriately conveying his admiration for their esteemed names. The two Yunxia Sect martial artists were left dumbfounded.

This… there’s actually someone who wants to go to our island voluntarily! Is this kid crazy or just foolish?

The two exchanged glances, their expressions strange, and they didn’t respond.

Yang Kai appeared increasingly anxious: “You two, I just arrived in Haicheng today and am a bit short on funds. But rest assured, if I can join the Yunxia Sect, I will surely repay you two senior brothers in the future.”

This… is he trying to bribe us? The two Yunxia Sect martial artists exchanged glances, suddenly feeling their heads were not quite enough.

They had captured so many people before, seen all kinds of characters, but this fool’s reaction was simply extraordinary.

However, it turned out he was just new here!

If they had known, they would have enjoyed bullying a newcomer like him!

Yang Kai anxiously watched them, his mind racing. Although he didn’t know what the Yunxia Sect was doing capturing these ordinary people, he had no choice but to use this method to help the elder and his granddaughter out of trouble.

If they were capturing an old man and a little girl, they would have no reason to let him go, right?

Sure enough, after staring at him for a long time, the two martial artists suddenly burst into laughter, patting Yang Kai’s shoulder warmly. “Good, good! Since you have the heart to join our Yunxia Sect, how could we bear to stop you? Not bad, not bad! You, young man, have a remarkable physique and look quite clever. You must be a martial arts genius. If you achieve great success in the future, don’t forget the contributions of your two senior brothers.”

“I won’t forget, of course I won’t forget.”

The three exchanged glances, laughing heartily.

The two Yunxia Sect martial artists inwardly cursed Yang Kai for being a fool.

Yang Kai thought to himself that they were the real idiots.

The elder and granddaughter trembled on the bed.

After a while, Yang Kai finally restrained his laughter and said, “You two, don’t you think one person joining the Yunxia Sect is enough? Bringing along this old man and little girl would only complicate matters on the way.”

This question was what Yang Kai was most anxious about. If they were still unwilling to let the elder and his granddaughter go, he would have no choice but to resort to violence here. He had wasted so much time talking to gather this information.

However, Yang Kai was clearly overthinking. They had come here to capture people because the Yunxia Sect had tasks that ordinary people could do, regardless of gender or age, as long as they were human.

Now that they had captured Yang Kai, they naturally didn’t want to bring along an old man and a little girl. What if they died on the way and brought them bad luck?

Nodding, they replied, “Yes, you have a point. We originally intended to bring them for a reunion, but it seems your old man here is ungrateful, wasting our good intentions.”

“People grow old. It’s just like that. Please forgive us, senior brothers,” Yang Kai smiled.

“Since you’ve decided to join the Yunxia Sect, we shouldn’t delay. Let’s leave now.” The two Yunxia Sect martial artists, having completed their task, were eager to leave the cramped and stuffy room.

“Please wait outside for a moment. I need to say goodbye to my grandfather and sister.”

“Hurry up.” They didn’t suspect anything and simply instructed him to be quick before waiting outside.

Once they left, Yang Kai slowly walked to the bedside, glancing at the trembling grandfather and granddaughter.

The elder was a sharp man. When Yang Kai had been spouting nonsense with the Yunxia Sect martial artists, he hadn’t dared to speak, fearing he would reveal something. Only now did he tremble and say, “Young man, why go through all this trouble? The Yunxia Sect is not a place for just anyone.”

Yang Kai smiled slightly: “Old sir, don’t worry. I have my own plans. Don’t forget, I’m also a martial artist, right?”

A glimmer of light flashed in the elder’s murky eyes, and he felt somewhat reassured.

Yang Kai reached into his robe and pulled out all the money he had earned recently, stuffing it into the elder’s hands, solemnly instructing, “Leave Haicheng early tomorrow morning with Xiao Yu. Go as far as you can. Don’t stay here any longer.”

After saying this, Yang Kai patted Xiao Yu’s head and turned to leave.

It was only after the footsteps outside gradually faded that the elder trembled as he looked at the money Yang Kai had given him.

It was a stack of silver notes!

Tears streamed down the elder’s face as he knelt on the bed, pulling Xiao Yu down with him.

“Xiao Yu, one must know gratitude! Remember this brother’s face. If there’s ever a chance to meet again, even if it means becoming a servant or a maid, or even sacrificing your life, you must repay him, understand?” the elder sternly instructed.

Xiao Yu nodded slightly, her innocent face no longer showing fear, only calmness.

Outside, Yang Kai had already left with the two Yunxia Sect martial artists.

Yang Kai had initially wanted to find an opportunity to kill them, but before he could act, he discovered that the situation had exceeded his expectations.

The martial artists dispatched by the Yunxia Sect tonight were not just the two of them but had as many as twenty, including True Yuan Realm experts overseeing them.

Yang Kai did not act. With a True Yuan Realm expert present, he would be courting death by making a move. This True Yuan Realm expert was not like Zhang Ding, and during their previous battle, Yang Kai had only won by taking advantage of the situation.

With the situation having developed to this point, Yang Kai was not panicking. In the eyes of those Yunxia Sect martial artists, he was just an ordinary person, which was his advantage.

As long as he found an opportunity, he could escape, and opportunities always required patience to wait for.

The two Yunxia Sect martial artists brought Yang Kai to a three-masted ship by the sea and then ignored him. Their previously friendly demeanor had changed, and they now wore cold smiles, clearly mocking him as if to say, “Kid, you’ve boarded a pirate ship!”

Yang Kai didn’t mind this.

As time passed, more and more people were brought onto the ship. Some were crying, some were cursing, and others were pleading. The Yunxia Sect members on the ship ignored them, as if they had grown accustomed to it.

These people included men and women, most of whom were beggars or drifters, and some were dressed as fishermen, with hardly anyone in fine clothing.

In other words, the Yunxia Sect’s targets were all impoverished individuals. Because the poor had been bullied, they had no way to resist.

By the time dawn approached, the number of people captured by the Yunxia Sect had exceeded thirty. The martial artists hurried back, and under the coordination of the experts on the ship, before the sun rose, the ship set sail toward the sea.
