## Chapter 410 — Blood Servants Hall

Hearing Yang Kai’s words, Yang Zhen couldn’t help but look at him in surprise. He hadn’t expected his demands to be so high. Nodding, he said, “I will prepare everything for you, and have it delivered to your residence.”

“Thank you, Elder. I take my leave,” Yang Kai nodded in acknowledgment.

Turning, he walked outside.

“Young man, don’t be too soon defeated in the succession battle. If you fall early, I shall be disappointed,” Yang Zhen’s voice called out from behind.

“Elders, I look forward to witnessing it!” 

The words faded as he vanished from sight.

“Arrogant,” Yang Zhen snorted lightly.

The plump elder who had just gone to invite Cheng Bailian frowned and pondered for a moment, then said, “Yang Zhen, this boy is taking a gamble! If things go wrong, he could be doomed forever.”

“The succession battle is a gamble itself! Those young men all see the opportunity, yet none dare make such a decisive choice—only he dares!” Yang Zhen’s eyes gleamed sharply as he nodded gently. “Though no results are visible in the short term, he has already gained the advantage within the Blood Servants Hall. This boy from the Fourth Residence is bold and resolute, embodying the spirit of the Yang Family!”

Yang Kai had chosen those two Blood Servants precisely with such stakes and gains in mind. These astute elders understood perfectly: such a choice, as long as the front lines were held firmly without being quickly defeated, would yield increasing benefits! The main concern was to ensure the two Blood Servants were not eliminated while still recovering.

The Blood Servants Hall.

A special location within the Yang Family where the Blood Servants usually reside. Even from over ten li away, one could clearly sense the overwhelming fighting spirit emanating from the hall.

These invisible forces seemed to converge into a sharp sword, piercing and cutting the heavens.

Blood Servants were born warriors, talents cultivated solely for battle. Their fighting spirit was immense, constituting a golden hallmark of the Yang Family. Even when not engaged in war, the murderous intent residing within many Blood Servants solidified like substance, permeating the area around the Blood Servants Hall.

Yang Kai walked forward. Feeling that awe-inspiring momentum, his expression grew solemn.

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian stood respectfully outside the Blood Servants Hall, quietly waiting for Yang Kai’s arrival. In front of them stood a towering man, dressed in an unremarkable black warrior’s outfit. His physique was imposing, his expression unemotional. Long hair draped over his shoulders, making him appear extraordinary. His gaze was like a cold star, chilling and soul-seizing.

This was Feng Sheng, the Blood Servants Hall Master, a Divine Roaming Realm peak expert. He had meritoriously served the Yang Family, and after wielding the Blood Fury Technique, he was even capable of contending with those beyond the Divine Roaming Realm.

He was a renowned powerhouse throughout Zhongdu, one of the very few.

Since Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian’s report yesterday, Feng Sheng had developed some interest in the youngest Young Master Kai. Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu were his subordinates, and as Hall Master, he naturally cared about them.

He wished to see for himself what kind of person dared to employ Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu.

Several Yang Family young masters had come by that day, but until now the young master in question had yet to appear. Feng Sheng showed no hint of impatience, merely standing quietly at the entrance.

Tu Feng was secretly anxious. Though Yang Kai had promised the two of them yesterday and he did not doubt his sincerity, honestly, he was unsure if Yang Kai had enough merit to exchange for Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu.

What if his accomplishments were insufficient?

Just as he pondered anxiously, a lanky young man appeared in his sight, calmly walking their way.

“Is that him?” Feng Sheng asked.

“Yes, that’s the young master!” Tu Feng felt as if a great weight on his chest was lifted, his whole body relaxed. He exchanged a knowing smile with Tang Yuxian.

The young master was indeed trustworthy! It was a pity they could not follow him into this succession battle. Thinking of this, they both felt deep regret.

Approaching, Yang Kai raised his eyes to appraise Feng Sheng.

His gaze was sharp as lightning, his aura dense and far-reaching, his flesh and blood packed with incomparable explosive power.

Divine Roaming Realm, Peak!

Yang Kai’s eyes lit up at once, discerning his true cultivation with a single glance. A master of such caliber could snuff out his life with a single strike; the chasm between their realms was so vast that no treasure, nor even the sinister power within the Proud Bone Golden Body, could hope to bridge it.

Though dressed plainly, Yang Kai clearly felt that Feng Sheng was not activating any cultivation method at that moment. Yet the energies of heaven and earth continued to flow ceaselessly into him, refining his True Yuan constantly, making it purer and denser than most.

Truly a formidable Blood Servants Hall powerhouse.

Yang Kai inwardly praised, realizing the Yang Family’s position as Zhongdu’s foremost among the Eight Great Families was not without reason.

While Yang Kai’s gaze roamed over Feng Sheng, the latter was secretly observing him as well.

Yang Kai was casually dressed, without a hint of luxury, simpler even than many other noble sons. Such attire was undoubtedly more suited for sudden combat. Though young, about eighteen, his strength had already reached the eighth stage of the True Yuan Realm. Calm in demeanor, his eyes seemed ordinary yet occasionally flashed with subtle brilliance.

Feng Sheng’s eyes narrowed slightly, his expression grave.

He sensed a strong murderous intent from Yang Kai, intense and unmistakable.

Feng Sheng himself bore such killing intent, stronger than Yang Kai’s. This aura was not attained through cultivation but left behind only after killing, and only the killing of many.

For such a young master to have slain so many was no trifling matter—this was why Feng Sheng paid attention.

More oddly, Feng Sheng sensed another strange power within Yang Kai’s body. This force influenced his own murderous aura, causing him to shudder as if the violent atmosphere he had long feared within himself stirred unexpectedly.

Looking closer, however, Feng Sheng could not sense much else, only that Yang Kai’s True Yuan was exceptionally refined.

Shaking his head subtly, Feng Sheng frowned in puzzlement.

With just a brief perception, Feng Sheng knew this young master was not as simple as appearances suggested, but he did not dwell on it, speaking lightly: “Young Master Kai?”

Yang Kai nodded gently, turning his gaze toward Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

The two quickly stepped forward. Tu Feng said, “Young Master, this is our Hall Master, Feng Sheng.”

“So it’s Hall Master Feng!” Yang Kai greeted him politely.

“Since you have come for the Blood Servants, please present the writ issued by the Elder Hall,” Feng Sheng said, extending his hand in invitation.

After receiving it, Feng Sheng nodded lightly. The expression on his face, usually impassive, altered subtly. “Young Master Kai, please come in.”

Yang Kai stepped forward, escorted by Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

Feng Sheng did not follow but stood upright at the entrance.

Once inside the Blood Servants Hall, Tu Feng chuckled softly. “Young Master, I have never heard the Hall Master use the word ‘please’ with anyone before! Several other young masters came today, but the Hall Master didn’t even glance at them. Seems he has a good impression of you.”

Tang Yuxian nodded seriously as well, as if discovering something important.

“That means my prestige is somewhat considerable,” Yang Kai smiled wryly.

Tu Feng said solemnly, “It’s not about prestige. The Blood Servants Hall is truly grateful that you chose those two brothers.”

“Is it that serious?” Yang Kai asked, surprised but amused.

Just then, Yang Kai’s steps halted abruptly. He stared ahead in astonishment.

Before him, nearly twenty powerful Blood Servants stood in several rows, their expressions solemn. Gratefulness shone in their eyes as they looked this way.

Leading them was Zhou Feng, the Deputy Hall Master of the Blood Servants Hall, also a Divine Roaming Realm peak expert.

His gaze swept across the Blood Servants. Yang Kai’s face tensed slightly.

Each one was unmatched in strength, as still as a mountain, whether male or female, all elites among elites, with the lowest cultivation at the fifth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Even those at the fifth stage, taken outside, would match the eighth stage Divine Roaming Realm experts of first-rate forces.

The Yang Family’s Blood Servants truly possessed profound heritage!

More than twenty pairs of eyes looked on, and Yang Kai instantly felt an overwhelming pressure. This pressure was not intentionally released but was an aura forged by years of bitter battles.

Therefore, the weak always feel intimidated and constrained before the strong.

Activating True Yang Technique, pure True Yuan surged through his body, steadying his stance.

The gathering Blood Servants brightened in their eyes!

Zhou Feng was secretly surprised but concealed it. His expression grave, he clasped his fists and said, “On behalf of the Blood Servants Hall, I thank Young Master Kai!”

“Thank you, Young Master Kai!” came a thunderous shout.

Yang Kai’s expression shifted minutely; only now did he realize Tu Feng had not exaggerated.

Although he knew his decision had pros and cons, the gains exceeded his expectations.

“To each his own needs, no need for formalities,” Yang Kai nodded lightly, his gaze passing Zhou Feng and landing on two men behind him.

These two were both under forty years of age, yet both at the eighth stage of the Divine Roaming Realm. Their expressions were more serious and solemn than the others, their eyes radiating a warrior’s spirit willing to die for a charge.

They stood there, bodies trembling from unbearable pain. Their clothes, worn close to the skin, were stained everywhere with deep red blood, like blossoming plum flowers—strikingly vivid.

Beneath their feet, a pool of fresh blood had formed, the air thick with its faint metallic scent. Still, they stood firm, and none of the other Blood Servants looked at the bloodstains.

“You are Qu Gaoyi and Ying Jiu?” Yang Kai looked at them.

Both hurried forward and half-kneeled on the ground.

“Subordinate Qu Gaoyi.”

“Subordinate Ying Jiu, greetings, Young Master!”

Yang Kai nodded gently. “Rise. Since you are mine now, prove with action that my choice was correct!”

The two silently rose, their gazes resolute and fierce, full of tenacity and determination.
