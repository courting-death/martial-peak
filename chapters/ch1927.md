## Chapter 1927 — Starlight Passage

If a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert used his full strength, he would be able to destroy a relatively small Cultivation Star.

And here in the Starry Sky stood no fewer than six experts of the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and one of the Second Stage — seven striking together, a scene of unparalleled grandeur. If such vast power were to erupt, it could easily obliterate the Star Domain a million li across, turning this stretch of the Starry Sky into a barren void.

But in fact that did not happen; the eight-pointed formation formed by the nine Star Emperor Tokens seemed instead to become a bottomless pit, swallowing the Saint Yuan poured into it by the many experts until nothing remained.

Everyone's expressions changed in unison, realizing they had slightly underestimated the Emperor's device.

The Star Emperor Tokens the Emperor had crafted tens of thousands of years ago still retained such tremendous power — it was hard to imagine what unfathomable mastery the Emperor himself had possessed.

Eyes met and, without any need for words, the gathered cultivators urged their powers even more fiercely into the Eight-Pointed Array.

As time passed, the Eight-Pointed Array's light grew ever brighter, and the formation itself expanded; what had been the size of a wash basin had by now swollen to the size of a table.

Each Void King Realm cultivator wore a grave expression — to frantically squeeze out Saint Yuan like this was no small burden for them.

Yet it also exhilarated them; some among them had not tested their full power for a very long time. Having stood at the pinnacle of a Star Domain, who could demand their absolute best?

And now, that Eight-Pointed Array served as an outlet for power!

Gu Cangyun could not help but laugh out loud, heedless of the drain on his own strength, squeezing his internal power as if to see where his limit lay.

The others naturally would not be outdone; they unleashed secret arts and in an instant the energy poured into the Eight-Pointed Array gained severalfold in vigor.

After a while more, everyone's faces turned ugly.

For they discovered that no matter how they continued to force Saint Yuan into it, there was still no sign that the way to the Star Realm would be opened; if anything, the Eight-Pointed Array kept growing.

They could not help but glance at Yang Kai, hoping to read some clue on his face, only to find Yang Kai calm as ever, showing no panic, quietly directing his power with no less skill than the others.

His composure eased them somewhat, and they all took out restorative Spiritual Pills, popping them into their mouths and continuing.

This state persisted for three full days and nights; during that period the Void King Realm cultivators consumed untold Spiritual Pills and wondrous medicines to maintain their output, until at a certain moment on the third day the Starry Sky suddenly exploded with a low, humming boom.

The flashing Eight-Pointed Array abruptly expanded outward, then immediately contracted to the size of a house, stabilizing in an instant.

Mysterious lights flowed and the Eight-Pointed Array looked like a beast's gaping maw, quietly standing in the void — the nine Star Emperor Tokens had long since vanished.

The crowd ceased their exertions and stood stupefied, staring at the entrance of the Eight-Pointed Array for a long while without speaking.

"Is this the passage?" After a long silence, Ghost Ancestor asked; he could sense the power of the void within it — what stood before them resembled the Void Passage in some ways, yet was completely different, seemingly deeper and more perilous, causing even someone as fierce as him to feel uneasy.

"Go in, or not?" Gu Cangyun turned his head and looked around.

No one could give an answer.

All eyes turned to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai frowned slightly and said, "Of course we go in, but… everyone should recover a bit first."

"Yang Kai is right." Chi Yue nodded seriously. "There may be dangers inside."

"Then take half a day to recover. We don't know how long this thing will last; if we delay too long and it vanishes, that would be a shame," Wudao voiced his concern.

No one objected; they each produced Spiritual Pills and found spots to sit and recuperate.

Yang Kai instead pulled out handfuls of Saint Crystals from his Spatial Ring, broke them open with Saint Yuan, and let the abundant energy swirl about to help the experts restore themselves.

Half a day later, the group gathered once more at the entrance of the Eight-Pointed Array.

Yang Kai led the way without any hesitation. "I'll go first; elders, please follow behind me!"

"How can we let you do this?" Ai Ou snorted; after all, Yang Kai was his son-in-law — as the father-in-law he could not allow Yang Kai to risk himself. If something happened, wouldn't Xue Yue be widowed?

As he spoke, he moved to be the first to enter.

Yang Kai reached out and blocked him, saying calmly, "I am versed in spatial forces; this is a kind of Void Passage. It is more convenient if I go ahead."

"Yang Kai is right. Ai Ou, don't show off — spatial force is more useful in the current situation," Chi Yue agreed.

Ai Ou hesitated but finally said, "Then you be careful, boy."

Yang Kai smiled faintly and turned to Long Tianshang. "Senior Long, please take care of Dark Star while I am gone."

"Rest assured. I'll come by from time to time—travel is much easier now. As long as my Hengluo Commerce Guild endures, Dark Star will remain safe and sound!" Long Tianshang said in a deep voice.

"Thanks, senior!" Yang Kai cupped his fists respectfully, then plunged into the entrance of the Eight-Pointed Array.

Right behind him Gu Cangyun, Wudao, and Ghost Ancestor flashed in one after another.

Chi Yue followed closely.

Ai Ou said farewell to Long Tianshang and also rushed inside.

In the blink of an eye, only Long Tianshang remained; he gazed quietly at the entrance of the Eight-Pointed Array, eyes showing an unparalleled longing, then sighed and flew off toward Dark Star.

…

The moment Yang Kai entered the entrance of the Eight-Pointed Array, he was stunned by the scene before him.

He had assumed this place would be like the Void Passages he had traversed before — empty and chaotic nothingness.

Yet upon stepping in he discovered things were nothing like he had imagined.

This place was not a void of chaos and emptiness at all; it was filled with energy of the purest kind.

Tiny points of light surrounded him like a sea of stars; those lights fluttered like fireflies, as if they had their own life, vivid and animated.

Looking around, front and back, left and right, the view was carpeted in this starlight.

He felt as if he stood within an ocean forged of starlight.

Yang Kai could not help but emit a pleased hum; the exhaustion of opening a path to the Star Realm over the past few days seemed to vanish.

With a thought, the surrounding starlight was drawn toward him and attached to his body, immediately disappearing as it was absorbed.

The pristine force born from the vanished starlight flowed through his limbs and bones, filling the parts of his body that had not yet recovered.

Yang Kai rejoiced unexpectedly — he had never imagined such a thing would occur.

"This is…" a voice cried out behind him in astonishment; someone else was clearly stunned by the place.

Yang Kai need not turn to know the speaker was the Sword Alliance Alliance Master Gu Cangyun.

Moments later shouts erupted; Wudao, Ghost Ancestor, Chi Yue, and Ai Ou all shed their former aloof airs — the composure befitting Third Stage of the Void King Realm experts was gone as they were all shocked by the locale's abnormality.

"Such dense Heaven-and-Earth Energy, and… so pure and clean that it can be absorbed without any need to refine."

"If one cultivates here, wouldn't a single day be worth a year outside?"

"Exactly what is this place? Have we reached the Star Realm?"

"This shouldn't be the Star Realm!" Yang Kai shook his head.

"How do you know?"

"I can't say for certain," Yang Kai smiled wryly, "but I do know this is the place between a Star Domain and the Star Realm — only by passing through here can one enter the Star Realm."

"If the environment here is already so favorable, might the Star Realm be even richer?"

At that thought everyone could not calm down. If that were true, breakthroughs would be imminent — these people were peak geniuses of their Star Domains; given the right environment, their cultivation would surely soar.

"I don't know what the Star Realm is like either, but… perhaps we cannot remain here for long," Yang Kai analyzed coolly, not carried away by the scene.

"Explain."

"This is, after all, a passage. Who can guarantee it will stay stable? If some disturbance occurs, we might lose our way here forever."

Hearing that, everyone shuddered and realized they had been neglecting the danger.

Ai Ou nodded. "Yang Kai is right; this place probably cannot be stayed in for long."

Yang Kai smiled. "But there's no need to be overly anxious; since we're passing through, we should make the most of it. I just sensed that the starlight here not only restores Saint Yuan but seems to cleanse body and soul — you all might absorb some."

"Cleanses body and soul!" Wudao's eyes brightened and he laughed. "If that's true, we can't miss out!"

With that news, none of them delayed — they all circulated profound arts and strove to absorb the dense, firefly-like starlight.

But soon everyone discovered a problem.

Among the six, Yang Kai and Ai Ou absorbed the starlight at speeds tens of times faster than the others; especially Yang Kai — wherever he passed, the starlight seemed drawn by some force, swarming toward him like moths to a flame, leaving no speck of light where he had been.

Ai Ou's situation was not bad either, but compared to Yang Kai there was a clear gap.

As for the others, they were far worse off.

They had to expend effort and use their own Saint Yuan to draw the starlight in and merge it into their bodies.

In terms of efficiency, they were not even one percent of Yang Kai's.

"What mysterious art have you two cultivated?" Wudao could not fathom it; among the six, Yang Kai and Ai Ou were not the strongest. Yang Kai in particular was only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, the weakest in cultivation, yet he absorbed starlight most effectively — this baffled him.
