## Chapter 1936 — Liu Qianyun

Upon learning that the Star Chart in his Sea of Consciousness was deeply connected to his home Star Domain and could even let him sense the location of that homeland, Yang Kai could not help but grin.

In this way, no matter where he was, as long as he looked up, he could perceive the existence of home and seemed to glimpse those familiar figures.

A profound sense of fulfillment swelled within him; even standing alone in that moment, he did not feel lonely.

He wondered whether, while in the Star Realm, he could still draw upon the power of the Star.

He was the Star Lord of the Dark Star; back in his home Star Domain, no matter where he was, a thought could draw upon the power of the Dark Star to bless himself and increase his strength. Now that he had reached the Star Realm, he did not know whether that convenience still held.

With that thought, Yang Kai returned his soul to his body and activated the Dark Star's Stellar Origin within him.

At the same time, he watched closely for changes in the region of the Star Domain where his homeland lay.

Suddenly, a point of light flickered somewhere in that nebula; faintly, a weak starlight shot across the immeasurable distance and darted straight toward him.

In the blink of an eye, that starlight rushed into Yang Kai's body.

Really possible? Yang Kai was greatly surprised.

He had only acted on a whim to test it, but he had not expected that even while in the Star Realm he could still draw on the Dark Star's power.

Only… perhaps the distance was too vast, so even though he drew on it, it had little effect; the faint starlight entered him, but Yang Kai did not receive much benefit.

Sensing this, Yang Kai promptly severed his connection with the Dark Star.

After all, he was in unfamiliar territory; if such phenomena continued, they might draw unintended calamity.

He already felt a trace of regret for his rashness.

Immediately after, he closed his eyes, circulated his profound arts to refine the medicinal effects, and replenished his depleted strength.

The surrounding environment was supremely comfortable. The Spiritual Qi was extremely dense—far denser than anywhere in his Star Domain. Moreover, the Spiritual Qi here seemed to bear subtle differences compared with a Star Domain. In such an environment, Yang Kai estimated he would recover to his prime within only a few days.

As for his next plan, Yang Kai had not decided, but his present priority was to find traces of Ghost Ancestor and the others, especially the Fire Bird Liu Yan and Xiaoxiao. He could not help but worry about them.

Time passed. All was silent in the great mountain; it seemed not even a beast lived here, only the whisper of wind through falling leaves.

Suddenly, Yang Kai opened his eyes as if he had sensed something, his gaze turning cold as he stared at some spot in the sky.

There, a figure had appeared without his noticing, hovering quietly in midair. Moonlight fell, revealing her slender, exquisite form.

"It's you!" the newcomer said, staring at Yang Kai with a face full of astonishment.

"Die!" Yang Kai suddenly shot up from the ground like a projectile. Midair, he unleashed the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique; his whole arm became a dragon's claw, and accompanied by a high dragon's roar, a savage force like a tempest bore down on the woman.

"Wait!" The woman was shocked; she used a technique to nullify Yang Kai's strike while retreating rapidly, crying out, "There's been a misunderstanding between us!"

Yang Kai remained silent. The dragon claw tore through the void, reaching for the area of her chest as if to seize her heart.

The woman paled and frowned, saying, "Stop. In your current condition, acting rashly will only worsen your injuries!"

"Spare me your crocodile tears!" Yang Kai snorted coldly, adding an extra surge of force to his hand. Spatial energies coiled around him, his silhouette flickering like a phantom, and in the space of a blink he tore through the woman's defense, appearing at her side and bringing a palm down toward her.

The woman cried out delicately. Her fair hand swept in a semicircle at her side, and a ring of defensive light flashed to block Yang Kai's blow as she retreated rapidly, her beautiful eyes regarding him in wonder: "Despite being gravely wounded, you still possess such power—you truly are no ordinary person; no wonder you escaped intact from Senior Brother Yin's hands."

Yang Kai frowned and did not strike again.

His strength had not recovered much; since he could not kill her quickly, it was unwise to continue fighting.

Seeing him calm, the woman forced a smile and said, "Now we can talk properly, can't we?"

"Say what you have to say — and if it's nothing but hot air, then let it out!" Yang Kai showed her no courtesy, his voice cold.

The other party knitted her brows; though a little annoyed, she understood Yang Kai's attitude and could only say, "Your injuries have not healed, and I fear the Imperial Treasure in your hand, so it's best for everyone not to start a conflict. As for what happened before… I was compelled to act."

Yang Kai looked at her coldly and nodded, "Continue."

This woman was the same Third Stage of the Void King Realm warrior who had been with Yin Lesheng in the Starlight Passage, the one who had joined with the bald young man to attack Ghost Ancestor and the others.

Yang Kai had observed before that her manner of attack differed from the bald man—she had shown no murderous intent—so hearing her explanation now, he believed her to some extent. Had Yin Lesheng or that bald youth been here, Yang Kai would not have stopped at anything.

If not for those three stirring up trouble, he would not have been separated from Ghost Ancestor and the others, nor would Xiaoxiao and the Fire Bird Liu Yan have had to wander alone into the void rift.

Yang Kai hated those three to the bone.

"Let me introduce myself," the woman said, "I am Liu Qianyun. Like Senior Brother Yin, I come from the Great Wilderness Star Domain." Liu Qianyun parted her crimson lips and looked at Yang Kai with bright eyes.

Yang Kai's gaze flickered; he said in a low voice, "Yang Kai."

"So it's Brother Yang!" Liu Qianyun smiled, pursing her lips. "Then we are acquainted. I want to explain: though Senior Brother Yin and I both come from the Great Wilderness Star Domain, we are not from the same Sect. Previously I acted out of necessity when confronting your companions; here I apologize to you."

"If apologies were useful, why cultivate?" Yang Kai sneered.

"Think as you like." Liu Qianyun laughed casually. She was a figure of hegemonic standing and could humble herself to explain to Yang Kai only because she felt guilty; she could understand his resentment.

"Now that Senior Brother Yin is not here, I do not have to act according to his wishes, so I think it would be best if we reconciled."

"Reconciling is fine. Everything else can be dropped. Now go—I'll be tending my wounds and have no time for idle chatter." Yang Kai closed his eyes and said coldly.

Liu Qianyun smiled, "Brother Yang, why must you keep everyone at arm's length?"

"What do you want?"

Liu Qianyun smiled, "How about we cooperate? You and I both come from lower Star Domains. Newly arrived, we are unfamiliar with this place; cooperation would be beneficial. What do you think, Brother Yang?"

Yang Kai did not answer immediately; he pondered.

Liu Qianyun continued, "Since we're to cooperate, I'll be frank. Although Brother Yang is only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, your performance was far beyond what a Second Stage warrior could display. If it were your companions here—well… I would have no interest in cooperating with them."

"So it's an honor for me, then?" Yang Kai's mouth lifted in a corner.

"Don't put it that way. I simply don't want to wander the Star Realm alone; the Star Realm is far more dangerous than a Star Domain."

Hearing that, Yang Kai's interest was aroused: "You seem to know something about the Star Realm?"

"Not much, but I know more than you do," Liu Qianyun said with a sly smile.

Yang Kai snorted, "You know our Star Domain has been sealed off for tens of thousands of years — news hardly makes its way out."

He sat cross-legged, since Liu Qianyun showed no hostility; rather than remain on guard, he would spend the time recovering his strength.

"Ask me whatever you want to know; I will tell you what I know. Consider it a sign of my sincerity in cooperating with you," Liu Qianyun said, seeing Yang Kai relax and smiling.

"There is much I don't understand," Yang Kai said lightly. "How did you find this place?"

"Oh, I came out of a spatial rift nearby. I saw a starlight fall and thought some treasure had appeared, so I came to investigate. I didn't expect to find Brother Yang here tending his wounds," Liu Qianyun laughed.

Yang Kai looked sullen, knowing his earlier recklessness had been foolish. Fortunately, he had only attracted Liu Qianyun; if some powerful enemy had come, the consequences would have been unthinkable.

"Then let's move somewhere else to talk!" Yang Kai thought, unwilling to linger here.

Liu Qianyun nodded, "Fine!"

Saying so, the two of them flew off into the depths of the mountain.

Ten thousand li from the previous spot, in a certain cave, Yang Kai and Liu Qianyun sat cross-legged several zhang apart.

Yang Kai went straight to the point: "I have a question I must ask."

"Please ask, Brother Yang." Liu Qianyun brushed her hair behind her ear, radiating charm.

"Why did you decide to cooperate with me? Weren't we enemies before?" Yang Kai looked straight into her eyes, as if trying to peer into her heart.

Liu Qianyun smiled calmly, "Because I believe Brother Yang is not a villain; you're someone who can be trusted."

"Oh?" Yang Kai sneered.

Liu Qianyun grew serious: "I'm no longer a child; after living so many years, my judgment of people has some reliability. I won't claim I'm always right, but I have my own scale. I watched what Brother Yang did in the Starlight Passage, and I think you are a man who values loyalty and affection, and you possess considerable strength!"

"The latter is the point, isn't it?" Yang Kai curled his lips.

Liu Qianyun nodded, "I do not deny that, but if you were not the right person, I wouldn't have taken the initiative to cooperate."

"Very well. Since a woman speaks so plainly, if I say more it would seem insincere." Yang Kai nodded. "We can cooperate. I also want to learn more about the Star Realm, but remember… if you ever stab me in the back… heh heh heh!"

Yang Kai let out a strange, feral laugh that sent a chill through Liu Qianyun's graceful body. She recovered her composure and nodded gravely, "Rest assured, I am not one to betray my word."

"That's for the best!"

"Then, shall we consider it settled?" Liu Qianyun asked with a smile, her gaze fixed on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai nodded.
