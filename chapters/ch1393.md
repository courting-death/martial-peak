## Chapter 1393 — Anxious Wei Guchang

It went without saying that this person was from Myriad Beasts Mountain. Although for the sake of convenience they weren’t wearing their sect’s attire, anyone with eyes could easily discern their origin—after all, their primary means of attack was through commanding Demonic Beasts.

Such an obvious display could not possibly be concealed.

The Green-Eyed Blood Toad beneath the old man’s seat was a fairly powerful Ninth-Tier Demonic Beast, and combined with the old man’s own cultivation and techniques, man and beast together were enough to contend with a Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warrior; yet those who knew the old fellow well also knew he was not only ugly in appearance but monstrously twisted in mind, given to lust and the torment of beautiful women, delighting in torturing them to death to sate his perverse pleasures.

If Wu Yi were to truly fall into his hands, her fate would be more miserable than death.

“Heh heh, those two girls are strong enough; hand them to me and I could forge two fine blood slaves!” On the other side, a middle-aged man covered in a sheen of bloodlight revealed an evil smile—one able to make blood slaves was doubtless from the Demon Blood Sect.

“Enough talk; you all should find a way to jointly break this great array!” Xie Li said with displeasure, casually reminding them that a group halted before the array’s face, unable even to pierce the first layer of defense—what else was there to discuss?

The elder from Myriad Beasts Mountain sneered darkly: “Originally I had no intention of using this move, but since that little girl seeks death, I can only oblige her, heh heh!”

Saying so, his expression suddenly grew solemn as Saint Yuan surged within him; at the same time, the Green-Eyed Blood Toad beneath him puffed its cheeks and emitted a low, frog-like croak.

In an instant, the world’s Yuan Qi surged into turmoil, converging toward him from all directions.

Xie Li’s eyes brightened and he watched the elder’s movements unblinkingly, smiling as he said, “Elder Du, are you going to use the Blood Toad Poison Smoke?”

Hearing this, the other Origin Returning Realm practitioners all showed surprise and turned their gazes toward Elder Du.

The Myriad Beasts Mountain elder snorted: “Blood Toad Poison Smoke is the specialty of my treasure. It can only be used once; I cast this as a prelude and hope you friends won’t hold back later!”

With that, the Elder surnamed Du suddenly opened his mouth and spat a blood arrow that slithered like a fang-serpent straight toward the Dragon Lair Mountain protective array. Simultaneously, the Green-Eyed Blood Toad inflated its cheeks and spat a black, ink-like venom that enveloped the blood arrow.

The two merged and rolled together, and in the blink of an eye transformed into a pitch-black mist that slammed into the array’s light screen.

Crackling and sizzling filled the air...

A teeth-aching corrosive sound rang out across the protective array’s light screen; its radiance flickered and, with a visible speed, the array began to melt, forming a breach.

The gap was large enough for a person to pass through. Although it was soon self-repaired, the blow’s tremendous power was plain to see.

Even after two days of furious assault, none had managed to tear a breach in a single strike—yet Elder Du had.

Repair or no repair, that single blow had consumed a great deal of the protective array’s Spiritual Qi; with a few more such attacks, it might truly be torn apart.

After unleashing the attack, Elder Du’s face had turned slightly pale, and the Green-Eyed Blood Toad beneath him likewise showed signs of flagging. The elder said nothing as he withdrew a jade bottle from his Spatial Ring, produced a blood-red pill, tossed it forward, and the toad shot out a crimson tongue to snatch the pill into its mouth, its green eyes showing clear relish.

That blood-red pill was unquestionably a supreme restorative for the Green-Eyed Blood Toad.

“A fine trick, Elder Du.” Xie Li laughed heartily, secretly alarmed yet visibly pleased. “In that case, I shall not hide my skill either.”

Saying so, he suddenly produced a small, dagger-shaped Secret Treasure that shone with a silver radiance and brimmed with spirit.

“White Rainbow Dagger!” Elder Du cried out in surprise at the sight of the dagger, his face filled with astonishment as he murmured, “I didn’t expect this array-breaking divine implement to be in Brother Xie’s possession; Brother Xie’s fortune is not small.”

The other Origin Returning Realm practitioners also looked at the White Rainbow Dagger with greedy eyes, sensing it must have a significant pedigree.

Xie Li chuckled and said lightly, “No special fortune—merely obtained it by chance.”

As he spoke, he poured Saint Yuan into the White Rainbow Dagger with grave mien. No one believed his words; by all accounts, the White Rainbow Dagger was a Secret Treasure specialized in breaking formations and seals, its grade at Origin-Grade Middle-Level. Such a grade might be unremarkable across a vast Star Domain, but on Dark Star it was worth a great deal.

Rarity breeds value.

Moreover, the White Rainbow Dagger was likely an heirloom of a small family; how it drifted into Xie Li’s hands was unknown—perhaps Xie Li had used some means to seize it from that family.

That, however, was none of their concern, so though everyone despised Xie Li’s character, they said nothing further.

In a moment, Xie Li had activated the White Rainbow Dagger; the small blade became a streaking white rainbow that flashed and vanished, and the next instant it had mysteriously appeared inside the Dragon Lair Mountain protective array.

With a whoosh the White Rainbow Dagger shot out from within, piercing the array without obstruction. Though it seemed to have no immediate visible effect, everyone understood the array’s spiritual essence had been abraded.

The White Rainbow Dagger was famed because it carried a bit of spatial mystery, enabling it to breach spatial barriers and strike from within an array.

Such a Secret Treasure could not be forged with Dark Star’s current forging standards; it was a relic passed down from the ancient ages.

Indeed, after Xie Li sent the White Rainbow Dagger in several times, the protective array’s glow dimmed somewhat.

Seeing this, the Demon Blood Sect, Haixin Sect, and those Origin Returning Realm practitioners Lu Ye had rallied and subjugated all rolled up their sleeves, prepared measures they rarely used, and struck at the protective array.

Anyone who had risen to the Origin Returning Realm had not done so by idleness; they had survived countless life-and-death trials and harbored reserve treasures and techniques—if not use them now, then when?

More than thirty Origin Returning Realm practitioners acted together in magnificent spectacle; even a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert present would have to yield and avoid their assault.

Saint King Realm figures nearby also lent their aid, and for a time the various allied forces surged with high morale and overwhelming momentum.

Under such a fierce assault, the protective array trembled as if on the verge of collapse, and that sight only stoked the assailants’ excitement.

Meanwhile, fifty li from Dragon Lair Mountain, in Tianyun City atop a pavilion, Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu sat facing each other, each holding a cup of wine to their lips yet staring blankly and forgetting to drink.

Behind Qian Tong stood Wei Guchang and Xuan’er, their hands held respectfully before them, expressions filled with anxiety.

Feeling the violent energy fluctuations emanating from Dragon Lair Mountain, Wei Guchang could no longer restrain himself and said, “Elder, allow this disciple to go!”

Xuan’er did not speak, but anyone could see the anxiety and worry in her lovely eyes.

Qian Tong smiled slightly, set down his wine cup, and looked at Wei Guchang: “If you go, what can you accomplish?”

“Though I only recently advanced into the Origin Returning Realm, I can still lend Brother Yang a hand; it is better than standing here and watching!” Wei Guchang said in a solemn voice.

Qian Tong raised an eyebrow and half-smiled, “Do you think this old Qian sits here drinking for pleasure and watches idly, shirking his duty?”

“Disciple would never dare!”

“If that’s what you think, then admit it—what is there you do not dare?” Qian Tong said without concern.

Wei Guchang’s expression flickered with inner struggle before turning resolute. Cupping his fists, he said solemnly, “Then I must ask Elder to forgive this disciple’s offense!”

“Hmm, speak.” Qian Tong nodded lightly.

“Elder, not to mention Yang’s life-saving of this disciple and Xuan’er, merely his willingness last time to risk entering the Imperial Garden to rescue you—how can you sit idly by? What is Xie Li? He declared he left Yingyue Hall—does Yingyue Hall exist for him to come and go as he pleases? As for the dead Xie Hongwen, humph, everyone knows his nature; even if Yang did not kill him, one day this disciple would! Please order that this disciple and Xuan’er be permitted to go eliminate Xie Li! Even if Xuan’er and I are only at the first Stage, slaying Xie Li would be but a flick of the hand.”

“Arrogant!” Qian Tong chastised, though a smile lingered on his face—he clearly did not take Wei Guchang’s bold words as empty and in fact acknowledged the youth’s ability. “Then tell me under what pretext you will slay Xie Li? Simply because he left Yingyue Hall?”

“Isn’t that reason enough?”

“Even so, the Hall has its Law Court; it’s not for you to intervene.”

“But—”

“I know you have few friends; Yang Kai is one, and you naturally do not wish to stand by and watch, but his feud with the Xie Family was one he asked Yingyue Hall not to meddle in.”

“Now it is not only the Xie Family besieging Dragon Lair Mountain, Elder; there is the Demon Blood Sect, Myriad Beasts Mountain, and Lu Ye with the Haixin Sect…”

“Yes, I know all that, which is why I wanted to see what means he will use to resolve this calamity; if he truly can pull through, then he will be most remarkable.”

“If he cannot?” Wei Guchang’s confidence wavered; the disparity in forces was too great—anyone not blind could see Dragon Lair Mountain’s disadvantage.

“Enough,” Fei Zhi Tu, who had been silent at the side, glared at Wei Guchang; though he had not wished to interject, the youngster’s noisy clamor had spoiled his enjoyment of the spectacle.
