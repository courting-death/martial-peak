## Chapter 1471 — Yao Spirit

"Lord?" After a long wait, Ye Xijun hesitated, her face showing uncertainty as she anxiously called out.

Click...

A light sound came from the White Jade Crystal Coffin, and immediately a terrifying pressure, centered on the White Jade Crystal Coffin, spread outward like towering waves; at first the pressure was not too strong, but in the blink of an eye it reached a level even Ye Xijun could not bear—her knees went weak and she collapsed to the ground, unable even to lift her delicate head.

Imperial Might was awakening!

At the same time, where Qian Tong had been trapped, the struggle between Yang Kai, Shan Qingluo and the many warriors of the Hengluo Commerce Guild continued.

Strictly speaking, the six or seven Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm experts of the Hengluo Commerce Guild were indeed formidable, each possessing Secret Treasures of unpredictable power; being familiar with one another, their coordination could unleash extraordinary combat ability.

But Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo were no common folk either.

One treated fighting above his rank as routine and had many external forces to draw upon; the other had, by chance, devoured the primordial power of the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider—she could not be measured by ordinary standards.

So even though the Hengluo Commerce Guild held a numerical advantage, they could not do much to Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo.

At first they feared injuring Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo and held back, but as the fighting went on they realized that if they continued to hold back they themselves might be the ones to be routed.

Thus they went all out, but even so they reaped no benefit.

The entire palace was a ruin of chaos; various Martial Skills and Secret Treasures flared with blinding light, stirring the energies of heaven and earth into upheaval. Even the stele that contained the way of refining implements was not spared. Although Yang Kai tried to avoid its area during the battle, others did not know, and now the stele was crisscrossed with cracks as if it could shatter at any moment.

This made Yang Kai feel a deep sense of regret. After all, the Artifact Refining Dao contained within that stone stele was vast and profound — it could be considered a treasure in its own right.

Under the circumstances, Yang Kai was helpless.

"Yang Kai, it is not yet too late for you to submit to me; otherwise I will make you regret it for life!" Xue Yue, seeing the situation deadlocked, could not help but roar.

"In your dreams!" Yang Kai laughed loudly and refused without a second thought.

"You force my hand." Xue Yue ground her silver teeth; resolute, she rapidly formed handseals like a butterfly passing through flowers, and as her movements shifted the nearby Spiritual Qi began to flow.

The three long-whiskered old men, the beautiful woman and the others fighting Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo all changed expression. Looking at one another in alarm, as if they knew what secret art Xue Yue intended to use, they all feinted and drew back from their opponents; when they looked at Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo again, a trace of schadenfreude showed on their faces.

Yang Kai’s expression grew solemn as well. He knew full well that Xue Yue, now shamed and enraged, was bound to unleash methods far from ordinary. Yet with her blocking the way, escape was out of the question — the only option left was to stand and resist.

He refused to believe Xue Yue could truly display a divine art that would kill him in one move.

Besides, there was no murderous intent in the woman's eyes—she clearly only wanted him to suffer a little.

With that thought, Yang Kai braced himself for defense.

Just then Xue Yue let out a low cry and the surrounding Spiritual Qi poured crazily into her body. The next moment, a strange image of a Demonic Beast appeared above her head.

The Demonic Beast's body was covered in dense jet-black fur, its eyes bright and spirited, a single horn sprouting from its brow, looking powerful and robust.

Yang Kai's eyelids tightened.

Unaccountably, from that Demonic Beast phantom he felt a threat—this was the first time since entering the Imperial Garden he had sensed such a thing.

"Xiezhi!" Shan Qingluo cried out.

She seemed to recognize what the Demonic Beast was; no wonder—having drifted to Chi Lan Star, a yao world where nine out of ten beings were yao, she had been immersed in that environment and there were few Demonic Beasts she did not know.

"You have quite sharp eyes to recognize my Companion Yao Spirit. How about it? Surrender now and this Young Master will let bygones be bygones—I will merely prepare to exquisitely torment that bastard. As for you... remaining at my side as a concubine is not impossible; your looks are not bad, you could barely suit me." Xue Yue still tried to persuade; she clearly knew this divine art was tremendously powerful and once released could not be called back, fearing it would truly harm Yang Kai and Shan Qingluo.

"Companion Yao Spirit!" Shan Qingluo's beautiful eyes narrowed, then she gave a light, mocking laugh. "I underestimated your Hengluo Commerce Guild—so you even obtained such a thing, but what of it? You want this Queen to be your concubine? Don’t make me laugh.”

Yang Kai frowned. He had heard of Companion Yao Spirits: one could take the essence-blood of a powerful Demonic Beast and, by secret art, refine it into the body; over time one could use that beast's abilities and even summon it to fight.

This was a kind of external force, but generally martial artists lacked the ability to accomplish such a thing, and even if they had the capability they lacked suitable Demonic Beast essence-blood. The power of the art depended on the grade of the Demonic Beast's essence-blood.

The Xiezhi was an ancient mythical beast, born with a fierce and battle-loving nature. Its single horn upon the brow was no weaker than a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure — perhaps even stronger. Its Essence Blood was undoubtedly extraordinary. Judging by Xue Yue’s stance, she must have cultivated this secret art for many years. With such a Companion Yao Spirit aiding her, even though her cultivation was only at the Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, she could still be considered invincible among her peers — no wonder she spoke with such confidence.

He had no idea when she had managed to master this technique — back when they had spent time together years ago, Yang Kai had never once seen her use such a Secret Art.

Shan Qingluo's cold mockery reached Xue Yue's ears and her face turned icy. "Do you truly insist on opposing me?"

“Oppose you?” Shan Qingluo covered her lips with a charming laugh, her eyes rippling with allure. “Little Young Master, you seem to take yourself far too seriously. Looks like this elder sister will have to teach you a proper lesson — lest you forget your place.”

The Enchantress Queen’s tone was that of an elder lecturing a junior — enough to make Xue Yue fume with anger.

The two women fought openly and covertly; Yang Kai could not step in, standing helplessly to the side and watching coldly. The other Hengluo Commerce Guild experts all wore strange expressions.

The Third Young Master is quarreling with a seductive woman over another man—if this spreads... what a disgrace! The strong men present felt like committing suicide.

"Fine, fine, then let this Young Master see who truly doesn't know his place!" Xue Yue, enraged, pointed and the nearly solid Xiezhi phantom charged roaring toward Shan Qingluo.

Yang Kai's face darkened; he intended to intervene, but Shan Qingluo's graceful body swayed as she stepped forward, and the next moment a gigantic octagonal spider phantom rose behind her.

Heavenly Moon Demon Spider!

Without gathering Spiritual Qi or performing any technique, the phantom eerily appeared in everyone's sight; its body seemed cast from silver, pure and flawless, with a half-moon mark on the spider's forehead.

Though its appearance was grotesque, at that moment everyone who saw the spider did not feel fear; instead they thought the enormous spider was incomparably beautiful.

This strange feeling made everyone uncomfortable.

Yao qi surged to the heavens and heaven and earth trembled.

Xue Yue's expression changed; staring blankly at the huge white spider she felt a bad premonition, but with the arrow already on the string she could not draw back, and the Xiezhi phantom had already charged toward Shan Qingluo—she could not withdraw it.

"Go!" Compared to her, Shan Qingluo was undoubtedly more composed. With a delicate wave, the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider moved its eight legs and rapidly met the Xiezhi phantom.

One was an Ancient Divine Spirit and the other an ancient variant species. Although their ranks differed, neither was a living creature; their effectiveness depended on the caster's technique and ability.

So in terms of momentum, the Xiezhi and the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider were basically evenly matched.

In the blink of an eye the two figures collided—black and white, sharply contrasted—and faintly one could hear the beast's roar and the spider's cries interweaving. After the black and white met, shocking energy ripples swept outward, almost causing everyone to lose their footing; each person felt like a leaf on the sea, at the mercy of the waves.

Yang Kai acted as if nothing had happened.

The aura from the Dragon Bone Sword Dripping Jade invisibly blocked the terrifying pressure emanating from the center of the clash, and Yang Kai was not affected at all.

The black-and-white light masses were rapidly shrinking, clearly being exhausted by the fight.

Within only a dozen breaths, the two light masses fused together and the forms of the Xiezhi and the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider could no longer be seen.

The next moment, a terrifying explosive ripple spread from there; an aura that could almost destroy heaven and earth rolled out.

Everyone's faces changed; they hurriedly deployed defensive Secret Treasures to withstand the blast, figures being blasted high into the air and then crashing down, utterly disheveled.

No one expected this clash between Xiezhi and the Heavenly Moon Demon Spider to be so violent, and in the end to culminate in mutual destruction.

Xue Yue’s face was pale, and even Shan Qingluo’s qi and blood were somewhat unsettled.

Crack...

A shattering sound came from the side—the stele that contained the way of refining implements could no longer withstand repeated waves and finally exploded, shards flying in all directions.

Among the debris, something else was mixed in and shot toward Yang Kai's position.

"Huh?" Yang Kai frowned; quick of eye and hand, he grabbed the object and, upon closer inspection, discovered it was a stone token three inches long, a finger thick, engraved with three intricate ancient characters.

Yang Kai glanced at it and could not recognize what it was.
