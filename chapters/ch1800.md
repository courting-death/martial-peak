## Chapter 1800 — Great Emperor Blood Pill

Earlier, in Medicine Valley, Zi Donglai had been humiliated by Yang Kai time and again, and of all places that valley was saturated with the Seven Luminaries Divine Light, leaving Zi Donglai with no outlet for his burning rage.

Anger was like fine wine; given time, it fermented...

Zi Donglai wanted nothing more than to drink Yang Kai's blood and eat Yang Kai's flesh...

Sitting now inside the Skybreaking Shuttle, he had been fantasizing about how he would seize Yang Kai later and torture him thoroughly; the thought made him chuckle softly and his eyes go mad.

The laughter reached Xu Wei's ears and made him shiver; he had no idea what filthy thoughts had crossed Zi Donglai's mind to cause such nauseating laughter, and dared not ask, only plunging Saint Yuan into the formation beneath him.

"What the hell is that?" Yang Kai, fleeing thousands of li away, also noticed the anomaly behind him.

Although he could not see the Skybreaking Shuttle itself, the purple light vanishing was obvious, and, even more startling, the distance between them and him was closing!

In barely more than a dozen breaths, a gap of thousands of li had been closed!

At this rate, wouldn't they catch up within the time it took to burn an incense stick? Yang Kai was startled and his face suddenly darkened.

For now, his only reliance was spatial power, and spatial power was not inexhaustible; like Saint Yuan and Divine Sense, it required time to recover after heavy use.

At this moment Yang Kai was in the process of restoring it.

But with Zi Long and the others rapidly closing in, he had no leisure to wait. Gritting his teeth, he took an Ethereal Crystal from his Spatial Ring and held it in his palm, desperately drawing energy from it.

This Ethereal Crystal had come from a spatial rift in the Lost Realm; it was the purest Ethereal Crystal, birthed from the void itself, utterly unlike the derivatives found in regular veins.

Wave after wave of pure, arcane force surged into Yang Kai's body, making him glow with sudden elation.

The long-dry well of his spatial power replenished visibly before his eyes.

"Try to match my speed and you'll only eat dust!" Yang Kai assessed his condition and, aside from the wound in his chest needing a bit more time, decided everything else was fine. With his heart steadied, Spatial Force wrapped him; his form flickered and he was already hundreds of li away.

With another flicker, he was hundreds of li farther still.

His comprehension of spatial power had reached a new height; the distances he now covered in an instant were countless times greater than before.

Several such uses of spatial movement again widened the distance between them.

"What?" Inside the Skybreaking Shuttle, Zi Donglai, who had been delighting in thoughts of torturing Yang Kai, was stunned and nearly bit through his tongue; at that moment he realized with horror that the distance between them and Yang Kai had once again been stretched.

"Even the Skybreaking Shuttle can't keep up with his speed?" Zi Long's face filled with shock.

The forging method for the Skybreaking Shuttle had been passed down from a progenitor of Purple Star who received it from a Great Emperor; though the craftsmanship was imperfect, anything tied to a Great Emperor couldn't be utterly poor.

He had always considered the Skybreaking Shuttle the fastest secret treasure in the entire Star Domain; nothing should be comparable.

Yet now reality had slapped that belief hard.

Before a spatial master like Yang Kai, even the might of the Skybreaking Shuttle only left them choking on dust...

No, perhaps they couldn't even get the dust.

"This one must be eliminated as soon as possible, or he will be an endless trouble!" Zi Long trembled inwardly, a heavy fear showing on his face.

The next moment he barked at Xu Wei, "Xu Wei, what are you hesitating for? Burst out with everything you've got!"

Xu Wei's mouth twitched, bitterness filling him.

Merely sitting in that formation was already tormenting him; the formation's extraction force made him feel as if his Saint Yuan was flooding out like a breached dam.

And now Zi Long was demanding he erupt with full power—wasn't that asking for his life?

"Xu Wei, do you want to die? Turns out you weren't giving it your all!" Zi Donglai roared angrily, glowering at Xu Wei.

"Young Master, calm down, calm down, this old servant will go all out!" Xu Wei, upon meeting Zi Donglai's gaze, broke into a cold sweat; he knew that if he dared stall, his life might truly be forfeit.

Zi Donglai was no easy man to deal with.

Without hesitation, Xu Wei poured more Saint Yuan into the formation.

With a hum, the Skybreaking Shuttle's speed shot up considerably.

"Ha, so it's faster now; let's see if you can escape this time!" Zi Donglai went completely mad, clapping and shouting where he sat.

Thousands of li away, Yang Kai frowned. "They can accelerate it? Interesting—very well, I'll keep my distance and see how long they can follow. Although... that vessel looks oddly familiar; it seems like one of the small warships Yang Yan forged."

He had his doubts deep down, unaware that the forging method for that vessel did indeed come from Yang Yan.

Purple Star simply lacked the capacity to replicate the forging; the warship Yang Yan crafted was far superior.

Yang Yan's warship could truly rend the void.

For a time, the Star Domain staged a drama of flight and pursuit.

As time passed, Yang Kai's wounds gradually healed.

His physique was naturally ferocious; his Golden Blood possessed frightening regenerative power, so he needed to do little—the places injured by the Divine Bird were steadily repairing themselves.

That was him—had other fighters suffered such an assault, they would likely be dead or have lost half their life.

When his injuries mended, Yang Kai felt even more at ease. He calmly guided his Star Shuttle; when he sensed the Skybreaking Shuttle drawing near, he would flash with spatial power several times to widen the gap, and when far enough, slow down to let them catch up.

This fishing-like tactic left Zi Long and his son Zi Donglai so frustrated they nearly coughed up blood.

After so many days of pursuit, both father and son were in horrible moods; veins bulged on their foreheads.

Xu Wei was almost a withered husk!

Only now did he realize the formation was extracting not just his Saint Yuan, but also his very essence.

A warrior's essence was similar to a Cultivation Star's Origin—consuming that essence drained vitality and was extremely difficult to replenish!

Xu Wei had long wanted to stop, but under Zi Donglai's tyranny he dared not give up; he gritted his teeth, sat upon the formation, took pills to patch himself up, and endured the formation's drain.

Now the once-imposing Elder Xu had been reduced to skin and bone; his black hair had turned silver, and he looked decrepit and pitiful.

He never imagined that as a Void King Realm he would fall so low—truly a wretched fate.

His hatred for Zi Long and his son surged like a flood!

Yet despite all this, Zi Donglai remained dissatisfied with him, constantly cursing him a waste.

In Zi Donglai's view, the Skybreaking Shuttle had failed to catch Yang Kai solely because Xu Wei was useless; had Xu Wei been competent, they would already have captured Yang Kai and returned to Purple Star to celebrate, not still be trailing after Yang Kai.

"Xu Wei, take this." Zi Long suddenly produced a Spiritual Pill from his Spatial Ring and handed it to Xu Wei.

Xu Wei opened his cloudy eyes and glanced at it; his heart thudded and he asked instinctively, "What pill is this?"

The pill was blood-red and gave off a thick stench of blood that made one retch; within it lurked a violent, brutal aura.

Xu Wei dared not take it lightly—he was already on his last threads; any mishap might kill him.

"Take it when I tell you to take it—no more nonsense!" Zi Long snapped, but when his eyes flicked to the pill, an unnoticeable reluctance crossed his face.

Xu Wei saw the change and immediately realized this pill must be something extraordinary.

"Great Emperor Blood Pill!" Zi Long said in a low voice.

The next moment Xu Wei's eyes bulged; with almost no hesitation he snatched the pill and shoved it into his mouth.

Instantly he groaned; a dense surge of Qi and blood burst from his emaciated frame, his body inflating as if filled with air.

His formerly sallow skin grew ruddy, and his white hair visibly darkened.

"Ha!" Xu Wei laughed long and loud; he became vigorous in an instant, as if rejuvenated by centuries.

"Lord Zi Long's gift of a pill—Xu Wei is eternally grateful. Young Master, rest assured, this old servant will give his all!" Xu Wei said in a deep voice, then wildly drove Saint Yuan into the formation.

Zi Long slightly nodded, a satisfied expression crossing his face.

The Great Emperor Blood Pill could only be concocted by a Void King-Grade alchemist on Purple Star; even Zi Long himself possessed only two of them—rare reserves kept for life-or-death moments across the past century.

While its effects did not reach the legendary Immortal Source Liquid, it was still heaven-defying; Xu Wei's transformations before and after proved its potency.

Had the situation not been so desperate, he would never have handed such a pill to Xu Wei.

But Xu Wei was the key to propelling the Skybreaking Shuttle; without him, they could not succeed, so Zi Long had to bleed to make the choice.

With the Great Emperor Blood Pill supporting him, Xu Wei could hold on much longer; if they could seize Yang Kai, such an expenditure would return ten million times over.

"Xu Wei, it's up to you. If this mission succeeds, I will have my son lift the mark on your soul," Zi Long said indifferently.

Xu Wei's body trembled; a look of desperate longing appeared on his face. He nodded wordlessly and threw himself fully into the effort.

Once a Void King Realm, he was now subjugated by a youngster like Zi Donglai, his pride gone and his future full of dread; Zi Long's single promise gave him hope, and so he held nothing back—he simply wanted to catch Yang Kai and complete his task.
