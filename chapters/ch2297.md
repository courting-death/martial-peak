## Chapter 2297 — Disturbance at the Restaurant

Not only that, he suddenly felt his whole body lighten, his mind becoming clear and refreshed, with Origin Qi flowing even more vigorously within him.

Noticing this, Yang Kai was slightly startled, but quickly realized it was because he had made a breakthrough in his state of mind.

Instantly, joy appeared on his face. It seemed that choosing to come out for a stroll was indeed a wise decision.

If he had stayed meditating in the Heaven Puppet Tower, he might have gotten stuck in a rut and never had such an opportunity.

Before long, the waiter brought over fine dishes and good wine. Although the waiter had exaggerated a bit, the food and drink here were indeed excellent. None of the ingredients were ordinary, each containing great energy. In theory, if one ate here for years, it could improve their cultivation.

But such improvement was minimal, far less solid and pure than diligent cultivation.

That’s why martial artists generally didn’t choose this method to advance. Not to mention, eating here daily would cost a fortune in Source Crystals, and the gains were extremely limited. It was better to cultivate honestly.

Still, Yang Kai had no intention of arguing with the waiter. He praised him a few times, tipped him some Source Crystals, sent him on his way, and sat alone to drink at his own pace.

The third floor of the restaurant was also full of guests, some in groups of three or five, some in pairs. There were only a few tables like Yang Kai’s, with a single person.

These people, drinking happily, naturally chatted loudly about local customs and strange tales. Yang Kai listened with some interest. For some reason—perhaps just a man’s nature—the topic soon shifted to City Lord Luo Jin’s plans to take a new concubine. 

“Speaking of our City Lord, heh, don’t be fooled by his age—he’s enjoying all the pleasures of the world!”

“That’s right, the City Lord already has fourteen concubines. With the new one tomorrow, that’ll make fifteen. I wonder if the City Lord can keep up, haha!”

“Leaving a beauty alone in an empty room is truly cruel. If Lord Luo can’t share his favor equally, the City Lord’s harem will surely be in chaos.”

“Oh? From the way you’re talking, do you have some ideas?”

“Heh, how could I dare? I’m just speaking casually.”

“You sound almost regretful. I thought you wanted to help the City Lord yourself… heh heh heh…”

“If I had the chance, I wouldn’t mind trying. After all, they say dying beneath a beauty leaves no regrets.”

“You two have had too much to drink! Watch your mouths—walls have ears, and trouble comes from careless words!”

Someone suddenly snorted, quietly warning them. The two who had been talking turned pale and awkwardly said, “We did drink a bit too much. Did I say anything just now?”

“No, I didn’t say anything either. Come, let’s drink!”

For a moment, the topic changed. But soon, someone else said, “Back to the point, the City Lord’s fourteen wives are all said to be stunning beauties. To live life to Lord Luo’s extent… one could truly die without regrets."

“That’s what comes with being City Lord. But from what you’re saying, have you actually seen the City Lord’s wives?”

“No, the City Lord keeps them hidden in the mansion. Even when they go out, they wear black veils and are surrounded by guards. How could I have seen them?”

The man smiled, “Heh, I haven’t had that luck myself. But my niece serves as a maid in the City Lord’s mansion, attending to the wives. According to her, every one of them is breathtaking, and the new wife is especially outstanding, greatly favored by the City Lord.”

“Oh? You even have information on the new wife? Tell us, what is she like?”

“Exactly, we’re all curious.”

The man smiled, “I don’t mind telling, but about this table’s bill…”

“I’ll cover it! Waiter, bring a few more bottles of your best wine!” someone shouted.

The man smiled and cupped his fists, “You’re generous, friend. In that case, I’ll tell you.” As he spoke, he wiped his mouth and began describing the new wife’s appearance. He was quite eloquent, and as he spoke, everyone seemed to see a graceful, enchanting woman walking toward them from the void. For a moment, they all wore dazed, entranced expressions, and a few nearly drooled.

“Hmph!” Just then, someone suddenly snorted heavily, slamming his wine cup on the table with a loud bang. Everyone’s fantasies were interrupted, and they looked over in annoyance. Yang Kai, who had been listening with interest, also turned to look and saw a burly man sitting alone, reeking of alcohol, with a fierce, unruly face. Sweeping him with Divine Sense, Yang Kai found that the man was only at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, and seemed to have been injured recently—his aura was unstable, and his right eye had been stabbed blind, leaving only a white pupil. Combined with his savage features, he looked truly intimidating. For some reason, the one-eyed man was furious, crushing his wine jug in his hand so that fragrant wine dripped down his fingers.

“So it’s you, Brother Chai, the Tiger from the Mountain.” The man who had been speaking before laughed, then patted his mouth, “No, no, I should say… One-Eyed Tiger! Hahaha!” He made no effort to hide his mockery, and the others laughed along, clearly not fond of this man surnamed Chai.

“Brother Chai, I’m curious—who blinded your eye?” the man asked after laughing.

Chai Hu grunted, not answering, just sitting there with a fierce look, rolling his one white eye at the man. “Don’t spout nonsense here, or I’ll tear your mouth off!”

The man’s face changed, and he growled, “What nonsense? What do you mean by that?”

Chai Hu said, “That young lady… is not as you say!”

“Which young lady?” The man frowned, then quickly realized, squinting, “Chai Hu, are you talking about the new City Lord’s wife?”

Chai Hu snorted, picked up his wine cup, and drained it.

The man pressed, “From your reaction, have you seen the City Lord’s wife?”

Chai Hu paused, a look of reminiscence flashing in his only eye, but it quickly disappeared. He said coldly, “No need to ask.”

The man was stunned, then clapped and laughed, “I know how you lost your eye!” He paused for effect, then burst out, “You must have tried to peek at the new City Lord’s wife bathing, and she stabbed it out!” The whole room erupted in laughter.

Chai Hu suddenly stood, flipping the table. In a flash, like a tiger descending the mountain, he charged at the man, a broadsword in hand as he swung at him. Perhaps the words had touched Chai Hu’s reverse scale, for now his killing intent was almost tangible, frightening the man into quickly circulating his Qi to defend himself. Both were at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm, so their desperate fight created quite a commotion. Qi waves rolled, Saint Yuan surged, and all the tables on the third floor were overturned. The whole restaurant shook, nearly collapsing.

The shopkeeper, hearing the noise, rushed up and saw the two fighting to the death. His face turned white as he begged them to take their battle outside the city. But neither listened. Yang Kai shook his head helplessly, picked up his wine cup, finished his drink, tossed down some Source Crystals, and left the restaurant, blending into the crowd.

Fights between martial artists were extremely common. Every martial artist lived on the edge of a blade. Today, one of those two might die, but that was their fate. Yang Kai had no intention of interfering. He planned to return straight to the Heaven Puppet Tower, but as he passed a pharmacy, he suddenly stopped and strolled inside. The pharmacy belonged to the Ziyuan Commerce Guild, as shown by the sign at the door. He wanted to take the opportunity to buy some herbs. Lately, he had used up a lot of pills, and though he still had plenty of materials in his Spatial Ring, he needed some supplementary ingredients for alchemy, which could only be bought.

The scale of this Ziyuan Commerce Guild medicinal shop in Tianhe City was far larger than the Spiritual Pill shop in Fenglin City, and its stock was correspondingly abundant. Accompanied by a shop assistant, Yang Kai selected many herbs he deemed useful. The assistant’s face lit up with joy, secretly thinking he had run into a walking God of Wealth. His attitude became even more respectful, attending to Yang Kai with utmost diligence and care.

After spending a full hour making his selections, Yang Kai finally finished and had the assistant bundle and organize all the goods before heading to the counter to settle the bill. The shopkeeper, clearly realizing he had encountered a big spender as well, wore an especially warm and amiable smile.

As he was calculating the bill, the light at the door dimmed and someone walked in. The shopkeeper looked up and was immediately taken aback. “Miss Luo!” he said hurriedly. “I failed to notice your arrival—please forgive my discourtesy.”

Hearing this, Yang Kai’s expression changed slightly. He guessed that this Miss Luo was likely the daughter of Tianhe City’s City Lord Luo Jin, since they shared a surname and only someone from the City Lord’s mansion would be treated so respectfully. 

After all, the shopkeeper was a member of the Ziyuan Commerce Guild—an ordinary guest wouldn’t get such treatment. 

Curious, Yang Kai turned to look and saw a lively, charming young girl walk in, waving her hand with a smile, “Shopkeeper, go about your business. I’m just here to look around!”

“Please, Miss Luo, make yourself at home!” The shopkeeper smiled.
