## Chapter 949 — Again Meeting the Bone Clan

Chu Lingxiao cared deeply about the current state of Lingxiao Pavilion, and Ling Taixu wanted to speak at length with the patriarch; they clearly had much to discuss. Fei Yu waved discreetly at Yang Kai from the side, then slipped out quietly.

Yang Kai offered a quick apology and took his leave without delay.

Outside the sealed chamber, Cang Yan and the others followed close behind Yang Kai and emerged as well.

They had originally come to report something to Chu Lingxiao, but seeing him engrossed in conversation with Ling Taixu, they refrained from interrupting.

"Junior nephew, I hear your Nine Heavens Sacred Land has been doing well?" Fei Yu asked Yang Kai with a teasing smile.

"So-so," Yang Kai replied with a wry chuckle.

"I've also heard that the saintesses of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land obey the Saint Lord unquestioningly. Is that true? How many saintesses did you recruit, junior nephew?" Li Wan peered about lecherously, then assumed a mock-serious tone and warned, "You're young and strong, but exercise restraint—don't harm yourself."

Yang Kai felt a flush of irritation, unsure how to answer, and quickly redirected the conversation: "You elders just came back from outside, didn't you?"

"Yes." Cang Yan nodded. "We went to the snow mountain to investigate a situation."

"What happened?" Yang Kai asked, startled.

The four exchanged glances. Fei Yu hesitated, then said, "Junior nephew, you're not an outsider—it's fine to tell you, right?"

Cang Yan nodded. "We can tell you, and it also serves as a warning so your Nine Heavens Sacred Land can be on guard."

Seeing their solemn faces, Yang Kai realized this was no ordinary matter; otherwise four Saint Realm experts would not treat it with such gravity.

"Come with us." Fei Yu beckoned, and together with the other three elders she led Yang Kai aside.

“Half a year ago, when the world’s Small Xuan Realms all began opening on their own—that matter, Junior Nephew should be aware of it, yes?” Cang Yan asked in a deep voice as they walked.

“I know.” Yang Kai gave a slight nod. He also strongly suspected that the reason all the Small Xuan Realms had opened was connected to when he destroyed that space where the Great Demon God’s Soul Incarnation had been.

Though there was no definitive proof, the timing matched: the destruction of that space coincided with the Small Xuan Realm entrances all opening.

"We don't know whether those two events are connected. But ever since the Small Xuan Realm entrances opened, a strange situation has sprung up around the snow mountain."

"What kind of situation?" Yang Kai asked.

"A top-tier expert suddenly appeared there, in a bizarre way," Cang Yan said in a low voice.

"An expert?"

"An expert at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm!"

Yang Kai's expression shifted.

Experts of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm were few and far between across the entire continent. Among the three races—human, yao, and demon—the total number of such cultivators did not exceed twenty.

Yang Kai knew the demons had only five such figures—apart from the Demon Lord Changyuan, there were the four great demon generals.

Among the yao, only three Great Yao Lords had attained that level: the Crimson Flame Thunder Dragon, the Divine Ox, and the Ice-Jade Python.

The human side had slightly more, but not many.

So for a Third Stage Saint Realm expert to suddenly appear by the snow mountain naturally drew attention.

"Which race is he from?" Yang Kai asked urgently.

The four elders' faces turned odd. Cang Yan pondered, then said, "Exactly because we cannot determine his race, it's all the more puzzling—wait until you see him in person and you'll understand."

Yang Kai fell silent, curious but no longer prying, and followed the four onward.

From their words it sounded as if this Third Stage Saint Realm expert was being held within Tianxiao Sect, which struck Yang Kai as baffling.

Capturing a Third Stage Saint Realm cultivator is no trivial matter.

Yang Kai kept his doubts to himself.

They wove through Tianxiao Sect and soon arrived at the foot of a peak with a concealed entrance leading into a mountain corridor.

Bright torches flickered along the passage, casting a gloomy, ominous light.

Feeling the pressure in the air, Yang Kai's expression hardened.

Fei Yu explained proactively, "There's a great formation here that restrains beings—it's where Tianxiao Sect confines dangerous enemies. Normally it's unused; it was only activated a few months ago."

"Is that where the expert is being held?"

"Yes. It's a strange case—we can't explain it either. Better you see for yourself." Cang Yan nodded.

As they descended, Yang Kai felt the weight of oppression grow heavier, as if the whole mountain pressed down on him, making his breathing labored.

It was clearly the lingering might of the formation. Though it wasn't targeted specifically at Yang Kai, he still felt its force—if it were aimed at him, he doubted he could withstand it.

After delving about a thousand zhang, the group finally reached a dim stone chamber where bright lines of light shimmered, converging into a vast, intricate pattern. At the center of the array, a humanoid figure was bound.

Chu Lingxiao's Locking Demon Chain was tightly fastened around the figure, pouring scorching energy that burned its shell, while its hands and feet were bound immovably by an unidentified secret treasure.

A terrifying, murderous aura permeated the chamber.

"This is him." Cang Yan pointed ahead. "Carefully look, junior nephew. If your Nine Heavens Sacred Land ever encounters such a being, take great caution—we still can't determine which race he belongs to."

Yang Kai looked toward the bound figure and his eyes narrowed sharply as he blurted in alarm, "The Bone Clan?"

"What?" The four elders all turned to stare at him.

Yang Kai frowned and hurried forward to scrutinize the bound being, becoming more convinced of his conclusion.

The creature bound there was, shockingly, a member of the Bone Clan!

"Junior nephew, do you recognize this race?" Cang Yan asked anxiously.

"I've seen them before!" Yang Kai said gravely.

"Where did you see them?"

"Seven or eight years ago, when I went looking for a senior sister of mine—up north beyond the sea, in a region covered by glaciers." Yang Kai quickly explained.

Back then, when he sought out Su Yan, their Divine Senses intertwined and formed a golden dragon and ice phoenix which roamed the heavens. Unwittingly they destroyed an ice mountain, and inside he discovered a frozen skeleton.

That skeleton was identical to the bound figure before them: no flesh, only bone and meridians, a horrific sight.

Yang Kai had been inexperienced then and assumed it was a disciple of the Ice Sect who had perished; he compassionately brought the frozen bones back.

The Ice Lord Qing Ya and elders Qian Yue and Qian Hao reacted as if faced with a dire enemy and revealed to him a secret.

Long ago, a strange race called the Bone Clan appeared on the continent. Their bodies are skeletal, with little flesh, yet each is powerful and unnaturally long-lived.

The decline of the Ice Sect was closely tied to the Bone Clan.

Qing Ya ultimately instructed Yang Kai to cremate the bones. But as he burned what had seemingly been dead for countless years, a trace of life emerged from the bones.

It had startled Yang Kai at the time and left a deep impression.

Now, seeing the skeleton bound here, Yang Kai recognized it at a glance.

Hearing Yang Kai's recollection, the elders' expressions grew even more grave.

"Are you saying... he has lived for thousands of years?" Cang Yan asked, incredulous.

"Likely so." Yang Kai nodded.

"The patriarch said the same: this person appears devoid of vitality, yet is still alive... he must have only recently awakened from slumber and hasn't recovered his strength, which is why the patriarch was able to capture him and bring him back."

"This Bone Clan member—was he captured by the Patriarch?" Yang Kai turned his head to look at the four of them.

"Yes. It happened the same day the Small Xuan Realm entrances all opened. The patriarch sensed an abnormal aura in the snow mountain, went to investigate, and within a few days returned with this man... we all assumed he was dead."

"Fortunately the patriarch was farsighted enough to bind him here!" Li Wan said, a look of lingering fear on his face.

The Bone Clan expert's body emitted faint ripples of a top-tier Third Stage Saint Realm cultivation. Though weak now, the rank was unmistakable—if he fully recovered, Chu Lingxiao might not be able to subdue him.

"When we came a few days ago his meridians looked withered, but now they seem more full, and his life force has noticeably strengthened," Fei Yu pointed out urgently.

"He's recovering!" Cang Yan's face changed.

What a shocking vitality: frozen in the snow mountain for millennia yet still able to revive—truly astonishing.

"Why have we never heard of such a race before?" They all exchanged puzzled looks.

"The world is vast and full of wonders; there are many things we don't know. Li Wan, go notify the patriarch and ask what should be done now." Cang Yan ordered gravely.

"Right." Li Wan flashed away.

They had only brought Yang Kai over to warn him, but when he revealed some of his prior knowledge, Cang Yan immediately took the matter more seriously.

Before long Chu Lingxiao hurried over.

"Li Wan has informed me of the situation. Yang Kai, how much do you know about this Bone Clan?" Chu Lingxiao asked sternly.

"Not much," Yang Kai shook his head. "I only know that to truly eliminate him, it's best to cremate his bones to ash—otherwise, if he fully recovers, he'll be difficult to deal with."

"Indeed. Such a strange race—I too have never heard of them. As for the Ice Sect, I know a little; I didn't expect any of their bloodline to remain."

"You know of the Ice Sect?" Yang Kai was surprised.

"Of course. That endless snow mountain was long ago the founding place of the Ice Sect."

Yang Kai was dumbstruck.

That explained why a Bone Clan member would appear here: the Ice Sect's fall was tied to the Bone Clan, and long ago they had likely fought here before pursuing the Bone Clan into the glacial realm and standing guard there for ages, seldom appearing in the world again.
