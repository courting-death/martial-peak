## Chapter 1026 — Can Leave Now

Inside the stone chamber, Bi Ya looked woeful, her voice bitter.

During this stretch of time, she had served at Yang Kai's side; although she acted very compliant and obedient, and Yang Kai was a man of plain words and deeds, she did not dare show the slightest resistance. But she was not foolish; on the contrary, the woman was very shrewd.

She had long seen through Yang Kai's thoughts: even if he truly could leave this place, he would not take her with him.

So Bi Ya had spoken plainly in advance.

She wanted to move Yang Kai with her sincerity and change his mind.

"If we can leave here, I will obey you from now on; whatever you ask me to do, I will do. I don't want to be kept here. I promise I will be loyal only to you…" Bi Ya pleaded, thinking that even someone like the Ghost Ancestor had been trapped here for two thousand years without finding a way out; if she were left behind, she would only grow old and die alone.

Such an ending would be utterly terrifying.

Yang Kai turned his head and stared at her deeply.

Bi Ya met Yang Kai's gaze calmly; there was not a trace of panic in her beautiful eyes.

After a moment, Yang Kai nodded lightly. "When that day comes, I'll tell you."

Bi Ya froze for an instant, then forced a bitter smile. "Thank you!"

"Mm, I need to think. You can leave now." Yang Kai waved his hand.

Bi Ya bowed gracefully and departed slowly, her expression growing ever more bitter, because she knew Yang Kai's last words were placation—he had no intention of changing his mind.

Time flashed by; about ten days later.

Another person died a tragic and inexplicable death; this time the victim was one of Lü Guichen's subordinates, an expert at the first Stage of the Saint King Realm.

He had been meditating on a level stretch midway up the mountain. Suddenly his body exploded into a mist of blood.

The second death made the survivors even more anxious and unsettled. They once again sought out Yang Kai, asking him to think of a way. Even the usually proud Yue Xi had to lower her noble head and, in a pleading tone, beg him to go and reason with the Ghost Ancestor.

Yang Kai agreed offhandedly.

But he knew that no amount of persuasion from him would work; the urgent task was to give the Ghost Ancestor a clear hope quickly—only then would he be pleased, and once he was pleased he would stop killing.

Yang Kai slipped away from the crowd. Riding the Star Shuttle, he rose into the Seven‑Colored Sky.

He sat cross‑legged on the Star Shuttle, and the Divine Sense containing the secrets of space coalesced into threads that probed into that sky.

One by one the powerful Divine Sense threads leaped forward, breaching the spatial blockade. They leapt beyond the restraint of distance. With a single thought Yang Kai could span a thousand li.

Soon Yang Kai's brow tightened.

He cast out thousands upon thousands of threads, but all of them lost their bearings in that chaotic domain field. Many severed their link to Yang Kai completely, and even he could not recover them.

An hour later, Yang Kai retrieved eighty percent of the threads; the remaining twenty percent had vanished without a trace.

His face went deathly pale; his Divine Sense suffered slight damage.

He hurriedly popped a Saint Pill that replenished Divine Sense into his mouth and used the Warm Spirit Lotus's power to mend his Divine Sense.

Another hour later he sent his Divine Sense out once more.

In the dark, cold stone chamber within the mountain, the Ghost Ancestor grinned and sneered, "Boy, do you really think I don't know what devilish schemes you're plotting? If I don't put some pressure on you you truly won't apply yourself. I hope you will be more honest this time; otherwise don't blame me for unleashing slaughter again… The first two times I held back; this time I'll kill someone who has some connection to you. I'll see whether you truly have a heart of stone."

Reflected in his eyes were suddenly the images of Shen Tu and He Zao and He Miao.

At the same moment, the three of them, each in different locations, all changed expression; they suddenly felt their whole bodies grow cold, a sense of death spreading around them, and they couldn't help but tremble.

In the Seven‑Colored Sky, Yang Kai sat cross‑legged on the Star Shuttle, steadying himself while his Divine Sense drifted, flickering as it threaded through the chaotic domain field.

He could not perceive the passage of time, yet he kept probing the void with his Divine Sense threads.

After trying more than twenty times and losing Divine Sense power over twenty times, he still had no substantial gains.

No one else could search for a way out in such a frenzied manner; even the strongest would fail. If Divine Sense is damaged too frequently or too severely, the injury can become irreparable, leaving one muddled and dull, even foolish.

The Warm Spirit Lotus, however, could very well repair Yang Kai's damaged Divine Sense, saving him that worry.

At one moment Yang Kai once again sensed his Divine Sense run dry, and a trace of disappointment creased his features.

Because this time, he still had not succeeded.

Just as he was about to withdraw his Divine Sense, he suddenly detected a subtle change in the domain field in one direction and couldn't help gathering all his Divine Sense together and thrusting it that way.

To his surprise, this probe pierced through as easily as breaking a layer of barrier; his Divine Sense instantly slipped free of the Seven‑Colored Sky's enclosure and leapt out of this prison‑like existence.

Then he saw countless beautiful and magnificent stars.

Each star radiated surging, tidal energies—some were icy cold to the extreme, some blistering hot as flame; on some stars wind dragons swirled and giant tornadoes swept the entire globe. One star looked like an enormous ancient tree, thriving and growing in the Starry Sky.

"Chaos Abyss!" Yang Kai couldn't help but hiss, his eyes blazing.

This was the first time he had broken through with Divine Sense to leave this continent and reach the Chaos Abyss.

He couldn't contain his wild joy!

Being trapped here made not only the Ghost Ancestor anxious, but him as well; living day after day with someone like the Ghost Ancestor meant a constant sense of life‑and‑death peril.

Now he had seen the Chaos Abyss; he saw a hope of life!

He became genuinely excited.

After calming himself, Yang Kai carefully confirmed once more that the place his Divine Sense had reached was indeed the Chaos Abyss, then cautiously withdrew his Divine Sense, unwilling to act rashly.

As he withdrew, he left strands of thought bearing his aura along the route as guiding markers.

Those strands of thought wouldn't last long; Yang Kai estimated at most a day before they vanished completely. But as long as they indicated the direction, he need not worry about getting lost in the interwoven domain fields of the Seven‑Colored Sky; he was confident he could leave.

Soon, Yang Kai retracted his remaining Divine Sense, his expression wavering, undecided.

He wanted to follow the trail of thought‑markers and depart immediately.

But he knew that if he left, everyone on the continent might die because of him; that was secondary—more importantly, he didn't know if his method could succeed before the Ghost Ancestor intercepted him.

Glancing at the human‑face mark the Ghost Ancestor had planted on his arm, Yang Kai exhaled softly.

He rose, abandoning the stirring impulse, and steered the Star Shuttle toward the mountain peak.

A moment later Yang Kai returned and strode directly into the stone chamber where the Ghost Ancestor dwelt.

As always it was pitch black and bitterly cold; Yang Kai stopped at the chamber's entrance.

"Boy, how goes the progress?" the Ghost Ancestor asked in a low voice upon sensing his arrival, those eyes in the dark fixed tightly on Yang Kai, unwilling to miss a single change of expression.

"We can leave now!" Yang Kai replied.

Unexpectedly, the Ghost Ancestor did not respond at once; stunned by this enormous surprise, he stood speechless for a long moment before he finally rasped, "Is that true?"

The Ghost Ancestor's voice trembled slightly, betraying his inner excitement.

"Boy, you must know what befalls those who dare mock me; I have waited for this day for far too long." He roared softly.

"I'm not deceiving you; we can indeed leave!" Yang Kai said calmly.

Suddenly the Ghost Ancestor burst into roaring laughter; the sound rolled like thunder, deafening, shaking loose stones and making the mountain tremble.

On the flat ground halfway up the mountain, Lü Guichen, Yue Xi and the others all looked over in astonishment, not understanding what madness had gripped the Ghost Ancestor. They huddled together as if before a great foe, each unnerved and seeking some safety.

"Good, I knew you wouldn't disappoint me!" The Ghost Ancestor's figure materialized before Yang Kai; one hand clamped around Yang Kai's arm like an iron hoop as he impatiently urged, "Come, we'll leave at once, we'll depart this place now!"

In his excitement he gripped with terrifying force; Yang Kai's bones were nearly crushed.

"Not so fast!" Yang Kai wrenched himself and pulled free from the Ghost Ancestor's huge hand.

"Not so fast? I'm in a hurry!" the Ghost Ancestor glared at him, his eyes full of malice. "Are you still scheming something?"

"Senior, you're overthinking. Before we leave I feel there are some things that must be said clearly," Yang Kai answered calmly.

The strange light in the Ghost Ancestor's eyes faded as his excitement calmed; he nodded slightly. "Speak, I'm listening."

Yang Kai thought for a moment and said, "Although I want to trust your character and promise, as a precaution I need to confirm that after we leave you won't strike me down."

The Ghost Ancestor sneered wickedly, "Rest assured, if you can fulfill my wish to leave I will absolutely not harm you; this is my lifelong desire. I'm grateful to you beyond recompense—how could I hurt you?"

Yang Kai's brows knit; in a low voice he said, "I hope so. I also hope you remember the oath you swore before."

"Mm, I remember," the Ghost Ancestor said, pointing to Yang Kai's head. "I remember very clearly! Is that good enough? Can we leave now?"

Yang Kai shook his head.

The Ghost Ancestor's face darkened; he snapped impatiently, "What else do you want?"

"I want to take a few people with me; it's just along the way," Yang Kai said.

The Ghost Ancestor immediately understood whom he meant and answered indifferently, "As long as it doesn't impede me, you can take them all."

"They won't impede you. Mm, I also trouble you, Senior, to call these few people in."

The Ghost Ancestor looked at him with keen interest. "Who should I call?"

Yang Kai immediately named several people; the Ghost Ancestor nodded and summoned them with Divine Sense.
