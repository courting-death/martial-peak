## Chapter 1008 — Pissed Off

Inside the mountain’s belly, Wei Wu fixed a piercing stare on Yang Kai; under the glow of that peculiar stone, his face looked even more sinister and vicious.

Yang Kai looked back at him, expression indifferent, unmoved.

The muscles on Wei Wu’s face twitched a few times. He hadn’t expected Yang Kai to show not the slightest trace of fear, and suddenly found it quite boring. Curling his lip, he said, “I can persuade Master to help you undo the restriction, but in exchange, hand over your Soul Imprint. From then on, whatever I tell you to do, you do.”

Pausing, he added, “In here, you can’t use your strength and danger lurks at every step. But if you hand over your Soul Imprint, I’ll naturally protect your safety afterward. You won’t be getting the short end of the stick—if you’re lucky, you might even join the Sword Alliance one day!”

“Are you done?” Yang Kai cut him off impatiently.

Wei Wu was taken aback and choked off his words.

“If you’re done, please leave.” Yang Kai gestured with his hand.

Wei Wu’s face darkened in an instant. He rose slowly, a cold, grim smile twisting his lips. “Brat, don’t refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. You’d better think it over before you answer, or you might regret it.”

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “I don’t know what you want my Soul Imprint for, but I will never let my life be controlled by another. You’re not qualified.”

“Arrogant brat!” Wei Wu burst into laughter as if he’d heard something hilarious, then lowered his voice in threat: “Tell me, if I kill you here, who would ever know?”

Yang Kai’s face sank as he narrowed his eyes at him.

Although that mysterious old man had said earlier that no one was allowed to stir up trouble here, who could say whether he could truly safeguard everyone’s safety?

And what reason would he have to do so?

“I’ve done your two Junior Sisters a favor. You can misunderstand me if you like, but you actually want to kill me?” Yang Kai’s voice was icy, a murderous intent quietly surging.

“It’s precisely because you did them a favor that you deserve to die. If not for your meddling, they’d have already died long ago…” Wei Wu snarled ferociously, but halfway through the sentence he suddenly realized something was off and hastily shut up.

In the darkness, the two locked eyes, both wearing strange expressions.

Yang Kai had thought this fellow disliked him because he feared Yang Kai would cut in and steal his love, thinking he fancied He Miao. Who would have thought the truth was nothing like he imagined.

He seemed to be wishing for He Miao to die as soon as possible.

Yang Kai wasn’t clear what hidden matters were involved here—most likely something to do with the Sword Alliance’s internal strife—and he couldn’t be bothered to think about it.

But because of Wei Wu’s indiscreet words, the temperature in the cave clearly dropped by quite a bit.

“Brat, if you want to live, you’d best forget what just happened. Otherwise I’ll tear you to pieces!” After a moment’s silence, Wei Wu coldly snorted his threat, then turned to leave.

At the instant he turned, a thread of cold light suddenly shot from his sleeve. Like a silent spirit snake, that cold light found Yang Kai’s position in the darkness with unerring precision, climbed up his neck, and looped once around his throat.

“Hmph, only the dead won’t leak secrets!” Wei Wu chuckled lightly and beckoned. The cold light instantly retracted and fell into his hand.

It was a soft sword, peerlessly sharp.

Then he turned his head, ready to deal with Yang Kai’s corpse and leave no trace behind.

Just as he turned, a figure suddenly slammed toward him. Under the gentle glow of the strange stone, Wei Wu clearly saw Yang Kai’s face twisted by fury. At the youth’s neck, there was a gaping, rolled‑flesh wound, and from it flowed golden blood.

Wei Wu cried out in shock, unable to fathom why Yang Kai hadn’t died!

This youth’s strength had been sealed, and he himself had launched a sneak attack with the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Saint Realm—there was no reason for it to fail.

Wei Wu’s expression was aghast, as if he’d seen a ghost in broad daylight.

His reaction was extremely swift. The instant he sensed something wrong, he re‑condensed his strength. The soft sword in his hand burst forth with dazzling cold lights that swept to envelop Yang Kai.

Yang Kai’s body seethed with chilling, baleful evil energy; a bloodthirsty, violent aura spread. His entire bearing was completely different from moments before. Now he was like a primordial vicious beast that had slumbered for ages and suddenly awakened. He allowed those rays to strike his body, a dense pattering ringing out, as he barreled straight through, closing in on Wei Wu and lifting a fist.

Boom…

The punch landed squarely on Wei Wu’s face. He heard the crack of snapping bones; his entire nose bridge collapsed in an instant. The stench of blood filled his mouth, his head spun, and he flew backward on his back.

At the moment that fist struck, Wei Wu was horrified to discover that his Saint Yuan had provided no protection whatsoever. As if it didn’t exist, the fist’s brutal force directly bypassed the Saint Yuan’s guard and crashed into his bones, shattering them.

That punch knocked him senseless.

His body ricocheted a few times within the cave, stone chips flying as he slammed around, then he hit the ground and almost couldn’t catch his breath.

Not daring to delay in the slightest, he scrambled up. Before he could even find his bearings, a great force slammed into him; a large hand clamped around his throat and pinned him to the ground.

Yang Kai panted heavily, his eyes in the darkness turning blood‑red like a ravenous beast. The evil might within the Indomitable Golden Body erupted like a tsunami and surged into Wei Wu.

He had truly been enraged.

That mysterious old man’s overwhelming power had been deeply etched into everyone’s hearts, and his warning still lingered in their minds.

Moreover, at the crucial moment of dispelling his own restriction, Yang Kai had no attention to spare elsewhere—he simply assumed that Wei Wu would never dare make a move against him.

In that instant of the sneak attack, Yang Kai hadn’t yet reacted. Only when pain lanced from his neck did he hurriedly gather his strength to resist!

Even so, a deep gash was torn across his neck, blood streaming down in a crimson flow.

He had almost been decapitated!

If not for his exceptionally robust physique, and if not for the restriction fully lifting in that very instant and his strength returning, the consequences would be unimaginable.

Yang Kai burned with boundless rage; his killing intent surged like a tide.

“You… how can you…” Wei Wu’s eyes bulged as he stared at Yang Kai in terror, unable to understand why someone whose strength should have been sealed could unleash such an attack. At this very moment, his body was brimming with evil energy—there was no trace of being bound at all.

That evil aura descended upon him like the collapse of the heavens, plunging him into a hell of ninefold gloom. His liver and gall seemed to shatter; Wei Wu couldn’t help but feel panic as his body trembled.

He felt that what he faced was not a cultivator of the First Stage of the Saint Realm, but a demon beyond imagination.

“There’s one thing you said right,” Yang Kai’s eyes were icy and emotionless as he said coldly, “If I kill you here, who would ever know?”

The sinister energy within him surged even more violently, madly pouring into Wei Wu’s body. In an instant, Wei Wu’s frame swelled like an overinflated bladder, and blood gushed from the wound on his nose like a fountain, splattering all over Yang Kai and drenching him from head to toe in crimson.

Sensing death’s summons, Wei Wu struggled frantically and unleashed all kinds of methods, but he still couldn’t break free of Yang Kai’s restraint.

Yang Kai simply pinned him there, unmoving, letting him taste that despairing terror in the moments before death.

After a good dozen breaths, accompanied by a miserable scream from Wei Wu, his fleshly body exploded with a boom. Flesh flew in all directions, and his organs scattered across the ground.

An invisible traction force emanated from Yang Kai’s left eye, and Wei Wu’s soul was drawn into it.

Yang Kai closed his eyes and sank his mind into his Sea of Consciousness, where he raised surging waves and used his Divine Sense Fire to refine Wei Wu’s soul.

He controlled his hand with extreme precision; the scorching force of the Sea of Consciousness wouldn’t immediately incinerate Wei Wu’s awareness. He wanted to torment Wei Wu’s soul, make him suffer fully, then erase him completely—using this to warn himself never to lower his guard at any time.

Terrified screams from the depths of the soul echoed within Yang Kai’s Sea of Consciousness, as if they would continue forever.

At the very moment Wei Wu’s body perished, somewhere tens of thousands of li away from the cave, the Sword Alliance’s beautiful woman, Yue Xi, was collecting herbs with the two He Miao.

Suddenly, Yue Xi’s delicate body trembled and her face turned exceedingly ugly. In haste she stretched out her hand, and a mirror‑shaped Secret Treasure appeared in her palm.

“What is it, Master?” Seeing her take out this soul mirror, He Miao’s pretty face also changed color at once, and she hurriedly asked.

Because this mirror was useless under normal circumstances; only when one of the few people close to Master encountered danger would she take it out to check.

For Master to take out the soul mirror now, it was clear that someone had met with some accident.

“Something happened to Wei Wu!” Yue Xi answered with a frown.

“What happened to Senior Brother?” He Miao also rushed over and asked with concern.

Yue Xi shook her head, stretched out a finger and put it to her mouth, bit the fingertip, and let a drop of blood fall into the soul mirror.

The mirror’s smooth surface suddenly became like a lake rippling with waves. From the depths of that lake, a strange fish clad in seven‑colored scales swam up. It shot out of the mirror in the blink of an eye, leapt into midair, and exploded.

In the next instant, seven‑colored light shrouded the soul mirror, and an incomparably clear image was projected before the three of them.

That image was the last scene Wei Wu saw before he died.

It seemed to be in some dim cave. A ferocious, twisted face appeared on the mirror’s surface, eyes brimming with a dense, chilling killing intent, as if it would pierce through the soul mirror and envelop the three of them.

Under that gaze, the three couldn’t help but feel a chill spread through their bodies.

“What terrifying killing intent!” Yue Xi barked low, phoenix eyes blazing with anger. “It’s that brat who killed Wei Wu!”

“It’s him?” He Miao’s expression turned odd. When she saw that face, she almost couldn’t believe her eyes, because this appearance was very different from the one she had known before—almost like two different people.

“How is it Yang Kai?” He Miao was stunned as well and cried out innocently, “It can’t be him, right? His strength hasn’t even recovered yet, and even if it had, with his ability there’s no way he could be a match for Senior Brother Wei Wu.”
