## Chapter 1879 — One Last Chance

On the warship, not only were Shen Tu and the others present, the Commerce Guild members were there as well.

Hua Youmeng, Xia Jingwu, Yao Qing, Haitang, Gao Hong and the others all looked at Yang Kai; in each pair of eyes there was worry for Yang Kai and confusion about their own future.

These people had long lived on the Cultivation Star belonging to Purple Star; though they had not joined Purple Star, they were half Purple Star cultivators. Now they suddenly had to flee Purple Star and could never return — they had no idea where to go in the future.

But they knew that after Yang Kai had caused such an uproar on Purple Star, there was no place for them to stand there anymore; if they did not leave, death was the only path.

Besides the Commerce Guild members, Li Nuo and Chun Yi from the Tongtian Auction House were also on the warship, along with several other warriors from the Tongtian Auction House.

At this moment, Li Nuo and Chun Yi looked at Yang Kai; gratitude filled both their faces.

The reason was simple: the Tongtian Auction House had been a planted mole the Hengluo Commerce Guild put on Purple Star. When Yang Kai had accidentally discovered Shen Tu's imprisonment that day, Shen Tu had asked him to convey a message to Li Nuo.

After this commotion, the Tongtian Auction House could no longer stand on Purple Star either, so Yang Kai had early on asked the Commerce Guild and Li Nuo, Chun Yi and the others to be ready; once Shen Tu was freed they would leave Purple Star.

The arrangements had been fairly solid and the plan had gone incredibly smoothly, all relying on the endless trump cards in Yang Kai's hand and his own formidable strength.

"Chairwoman Hua, let me introduce you — this is Shen Tu, the son of the Hengluo Commerce Guild's leader!" Yang Kai laughed lightly as he pointed at Shen Tu and said to Hua Youmeng.

Hua Youmeng was stunned and extremely surprised. She had not expected that the man who had scrambled into the warship just now would have such great backing; Xia Jingwu and the others were equally shocked, staring at Shen Tu without pause.

Shen Tu grinned and said in a carefree tone, "Since you are friends of Brother Yang, you will from now on be friends of mine, Shen Tu!"

"Exactly what I wanted to hear," Yang Kai said with a smile. "Chairwoman Hua and the others were dragged into this by me and must leave Purple Star with no immediate suitable place to go. Shen Tu, if it's convenient, would you watch over them on Shuiyue Star for a while?"

"No problem at all." Shen Tu patted his chest with a swaggering air. "I now have a fief of one million li on Shuiyue Star. Seven cities large and small — if you don't mind, you may come to my fief and act as general managers of a Commerce Guild there. Handle many of the trade affairs."

"A fief of one million li…"

"Seven cities…"

"General manager of the Commerce Guild?"

The Commerce Guild members were all dumbstruck. One by one their mouths fell open; they could scarcely believe their ears.

Before encountering Yang Kai, the Five-Party Commerce Guild had been an obscure small guild; such guilds were as common as oxen dung in Purple Star City. These kinds of guilds struggled at the lowest level — nobody knew when they would be dissolved.

Yet now, with a single sentence from Shen Tu, they could ascend to the pinnacle and taste a goal that a thousand years' struggle could not achieve.

With this advantage, and plus the over two hundred million Saint Crystals now in Hua Youmeng's hands, it would be difficult for the Five-Party Commerce Guild not to grow into something great.

"Is… is this… appropriate?" Hua Youmeng asked, face flushed with excitement, glancing at Yang Kai with stammering words.

"What's inappropriate?" Shen Tu laughed heartily. "Our Hengluo Commerce Guild is commerce by nature; Shuiyue Star has more guilds than Purple Star City. Since you are already Commerce Guild people, our goals align. If I entrust things to you, I can worry less — in future I'll rely on you all a great deal."

Yang Kai smiled at Hua Youmeng and said, "Since Shen Tu says so, Chairwoman Hua, you should not refuse."

Hua Youmeng still seemed to be in a dream, her face full of bright hopes for the future and slow to answer. Only when Xia Jingwu cleared his throat did she reply with a grateful, graceful bow, "Then, thank you, Second Young Master."

Shen Tu waved his hand, "Chairwoman Hua, don't be polite — from now on we're one family, no need for such formality."

Li Nuo stepped forward, hooked her arm through Hua Youmeng's and said affectionately, "Sister Hua, in future I will also work in the Second Young Master's territory, so please take care of me."

"You flatter me; it should be this Sister saying that, not you."

On the warship, people either felt the joy of escaping death or imagined a bright tomorrow; the atmosphere was extremely harmonious.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, turned his head as if sensing something, and snorted, "Looks like Purple Star isn't ready to give up yet."

Shen Tu's face changed, "What is it?"

"Ten warships are chasing after us, all Origin-Grade Upper-Level, and the lead ship is Void King-Grade!"

At these words, everyone's faces turned pale.

Void King-Grade warships were rare wherever they appeared; even the Hengluo Commerce Guild did not have many, and Purple Star was the same. It was not hard to infer that whoever was aboard that Void King-Grade warship must be none other than Kuang Shizong!

Although the Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship was of Origin-Grade Upper-Level, in space battle against the other side it was far inferior in speed and firepower; if they fought, they would be torn to pieces in short order.

One Void King-Grade warship alone could keep them tightly contained, let alone the other nine Origin-Grade Upper-Level ships — this was almost certainly a death sentence.

"What are we to do?"

"Run!"

"We can't escape — their Void King-Grade ship is faster than ours; we might as well fight to the end!"

The crowd clamored, each person full of worry.

Shen Tu looked at Yang Kai with thought, then suddenly laughed loudly, "Everyone, calm down. With Brother Yang here, what is there to fear? Brother Yang managed to get us out of a place like Purple Star City — now we're in the Starry Sky, with broad seas for fish and high skies for birds; can those Purple Star people really stop him?"

Hearing him, the panic in the crowd eased and everyone looked toward Yang Kai.

Seeing he was indeed calm and unperturbed, a look of composure on his face, they immediately knew he must have a way to shake off the pursuit; they relaxed and looked to him expectantly.

"Shen Tu speaks highly of me." Yang Kai chuckled, not hiding anything, and nodded, "Fine, since Shen Tu says so, I will of course keep you safe. Leave the external matters to me — you just steer forward."

As he spoke, his figure blurred and he vanished from where he stood; when he reappeared, he was already outside the warship, standing on the ship's deck.

Looking back, he could clearly see ten warships charging in pursuit, each moving with incredible speed; the lead Void King-Grade warship was like a tiger descending the mountain, unstoppable as it closed the distance with terrifying swiftness.

But after ten breaths the distance had been halved; a short while later the Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship entered the firing range of the Void King-Grade ship's Crystal Cannons.

Kuang Shizong’s furious roar came from behind: “Brat! Leave everything you took from my Purple Star’s Treasure Vault, or today this old man will fight you to the death!”

His voice rolled like thunder, expressing his fury.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and said leisurely, "Senior, why be so petty? Purple Star is vast; the things in that Treasure Vault won't be of use to you all immediately. I just took them for now; I'll return them to you later."

"Easy to say. Return them now and I'll pretend nothing happened and let you leave; otherwise, even if you break free, everyone on that ship will be buried in the Starry Sky!"

"If you put it that way, there's no negotiating." Yang Kai spread his hands. "Once the things are in my hands, I'm not intending to give them back. But if you insist on being stubborn, I'm happy to teach you an unforgettable lesson!"

“Arrogant whelp! Don’t think that just because you command the power of Space you can do as you please! The Starry Sky is vast, filled with countless experts and prodigies — far beyond what a frog at the bottom of a well like you could ever imagine! I’ll give you one last chance. Will you hand it over, or won’t?”

Yang Kai snorted coldly, "Senior, I'll give you one last chance too: stop the pursuit, or you may not be able to bear the consequences!"

"All right, all right! You've insulted me time and again — today I'll teach you how to behave!" Kuang Shizong thundered, and the hull of the Void King-Grade warship suddenly bristled with hundreds of Crystal Cannons, each covered in complex runes and patterns.

Dazzling light burst forth, making the entire Void King-Grade warship shine like a sun.

Terrifying energy fluctuations rose and surged from that ship.

Yang Kai's expression turned serious. Standing on the Hengluo Commerce Guild's warship, he drew a deep breath as Spatial Force surged around him.

Boom……

A muffled boom sounded; the Void King-Grade ship trembled slightly as hundreds of white beams like sunlight concentrated and fired toward where Yang Kai stood. Along their path every drifting fragment of rock in the Starry Sky was ground to dust as if melted away.

Crystal Cannons fired in unison — the most terrifying strike a warship could unleash. A single volley from an Origin-Grade, Lower-Level warship was enough to obliterate an entire city. The higher the grade of the warship, the more its destructive power multiplied. If a Void King-Grade warship were to unleash hundreds of its Crystal Cannons at once upon a smaller Cultivation Star, it might well wipe out a tenth of its entire surface.

Ten such concentrated volleys could destroy an entire Cultivation Star.

Those white pillars of light spewed forth and pierced the Hengluo Commerce Guild's Origin-Grade Upper-Level warship directly.

Like snowflakes under an intense sun, the Origin-Grade Upper-Level warship could not hold even a breath; it twisted and then vanished as if melted away like the scattered stones.

Kuang Shizong was taken aback, apparently not expecting such an easy success.

But in the next moment he realized something was wrong and abruptly turned his head to look to the side.

In that direction of the Starry Sky, Purple Star's warship remained intact and was still fleeing forward; Yang Kai, standing on the deck, was completely unharmed and looked utterly at ease.

Kuang Shizong could even see the mocking expression on his face.

"He actually teleported the entire warship away?" Kuang Shizong quickly understood what had happened; the man was struck as if by thunder and dumbfounded, his face horrified.
