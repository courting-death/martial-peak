## Chapter 118 — Master, You Are Just a Quack

The benefits were not limited to this alone.

Unintentionally, Yang Kai had absorbed half of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew. Previously, he had been somewhat puzzled by this, but now he could clearly feel that half of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew was stored in the most concealed part of his Golden Body.

When he advanced to the True Essence Realm, he could use this Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew to temper his True Essence, elevating it to a higher level.

This advantage was not immediately apparent but would manifest in due time.

Moreover, many previously unclear aspects regarding his Golden Body now became perfectly comprehensible.

His Golden Body could absorb energy of any attribute except Yang, storing it until needed.

The more energy absorbed into the Golden Body, the stronger his indomitable will became, and the greater the aid it could provide.

However, the energy fed back from the Golden Body was extremely sinister and Yin in nature. Once he activated his Indomitable Will, his eyes would fill with a bloodthirsty gleam, and his entire body would be shrouded in an evil aura.

Yet, because his body contained True Yang Yuan Qi to suppress this Yin energy—the natural nemesis of such sinister forces—he would not lose his sanity. The two energies restrained each other while complementing one another, allowing him to surge in combat power without succumbing to bloodlust or madness.

With this realization, Yang Kai finally understood why the Wordless Black Book had given him a copy of the True Yang Technique—to prevent him from losing himself in the overwhelming power surge and falling into madness.

Everything was now clear! Just as Yang Kai was about to open his eyes, a faint sigh whispered in his ear.

Soon, the conversation between Xia Ningshang and Meng Wuya floated over.

“Disciple... your master has done all he can!” Meng Wuya’s voice was filled with guilt, tinged with reluctance and regret.

For days, Meng Wuya had been using True Essence to heal Yang Kai’s injuries, expending great effort, yet Yang Kai’s condition had barely improved.

Moreover, the golden pill Yang Kai had taken earlier should have helped him recover significantly. Even if it could not fully heal him, he should at least have regained consciousness.

But now, not only was Yang Kai still unconscious, he had lost all awareness.

Meng Wuya did not understand the mysteries of Yang Kai’s body. That golden pill had failed to perform its life-saving function. It only temporarily treated his external wounds before losing efficacy.

Even the True Essence Meng Wuya infused into Yang Kai seemed to vanish into thin air, as if his body contained a bottomless pit absorbing it all.

Meng Wuya had no idea of the wonders of the Proud Bone Golden Body. Since it absorbed all energy except the Yang attribute, that golden pill and the True Essence had been absorbed by the Golden Body almost entirely, how could they exert their proper effects?

“Master...” Xia Ningshang had been weeping day and night, her eyes swollen and red. She had held onto hope, but now, hearing Meng Wuya’s words, her face turned pale with shock.

“Is there truly no way?” Xia Ningshang looked at her master with desperate hope. Meng Wuya was no ordinary man, a man of great power and knowledge. If he said there was no hope, then perhaps no one in the world could save Yang Kai.

“His soul seems to have been shattered,” Meng Wuya’s face grew heavy. “I have been unable to sense his spirit all these days.”

Xia Ningshang’s expression froze, her face growing even paler.

“But do not worry, he will not die,” Meng Wuya hastened to reassure her. “He is merely in a state of suspended animation—unable to speak, hear, or feel anything. Unless...”

“Unless what?”

“Unless we can find the Return Soul Elixir to reunite his scattered soul,” Meng Wuya sighed. “But the Return Soul Elixir... such a small place as this does not have it!”

“Where can it be found?” Xia Ningshang’s voice suddenly grew calm, resolute.

Meng Wuya glanced at her, then pointed upward.

Xia Ningshang fell silent, but her gaze hardened. No matter what, she would find the Return Soul Elixir and help her junior brother reunite his dispersed soul.

“What are you two talking about?” Suddenly, a dry, hoarse, and weak voice came from behind them.

Meng Wuya instinctively replied, “About your injuries...”

Before he finished, his face changed drastically, stiff and mechanical as he slowly turned his head. His pupils contracted sharply as he saw Yang Kai lying on the bed, eyes wide open, staring at him.

“Junior Brother!” Xia Ningshang could no longer contain her joy and rushed over. Her long eyelashes trembled as a joy she could not hide shone in her eyes, though worry still lingered.

Seeing her swollen, red eyes, Yang Kai felt a pang of emotion. He guessed he had been unconscious for quite some time, and these days must have caused her great worry.

“I’m fine,” Yang Kai said casually. “Just a little weak.”

“Master, come quickly and see!” Xia Ningshang wiped her eyes and tugged at Meng Wuya, almost dragging him to Yang Kai’s side.

Meng Wuya nearly stumbled.

He cursed inwardly, “Girls are so headstrong, so headstrong! If my old bones weren’t so sturdy, you’d have torn me apart by now.”

But Meng Wuya finally regained his composure, sitting solemnly by the bed to examine Yang Kai carefully.

After a long while, Meng Wuya’s brow remained furrowed as he muttered, “Impossible, it makes no sense, how could this be?”

Each time he spoke, Xia Ningshang’s expression shifted, fearing Yang Kai’s condition had worsened.

“Master, Junior Brother...” Xia Ningshang bit her lip and asked softly, her heart in her throat.

“Oh, since he has regained consciousness, there is no great harm,” Meng Wuya said, his face conflicted as he looked at Yang Kai with puzzlement.

“No great harm?” Xia Ningshang’s face twisted in confusion. From her master’s earlier expression, it seemed Junior Brother’s injuries were severe. How could it suddenly be no great harm?

“But this is unlikely,” Meng Wuya said, baffled. “Yang Kai, are you experiencing a last flicker of life?”

Yang Kai grinned bitterly. “Shopkeeper Meng, do you always curse people like this?”

Meng Wuya looked embarrassed. “But your soul had already dispersed. How is it back now?”

Yang Kai’s heart stirred as he recalled his unconscious state, guessing it was connected to his consciousness sinking into the Golden Body.

“Master, you really are a great quack!” Xia Ningshang stomped her foot in frustration.

Meng Wuya was mortified.

He had just said Yang Kai was in a state of suspended animation, needing the Return Soul Elixir to reunite his soul, yet the next moment Yang Kai woke up. It was like slapping his own face—embarrassing enough, but losing face before his disciple was even worse.

Meng Wuya felt his authority had been utterly shattered.

But regardless, Yang Kai’s awakening was good news. Though Meng Wuya worried he might be courting disaster by tempting his disciple, that night he had risked his life to protect him, allowing her to survive and absorb the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew. Such a debt could not be forgotten.

Meng Wuya sighed deeply. As the saying goes, good men do not live long, but their mischief lasts for millennia! This young man had just finished causing trouble for his precious disciple; how could he die so easily? His worries had been in vain.

Yet what to do going forward? Meng Wuya was torn, wanting to resolve matters swiftly but fearing his disciple’s anger.

Yang Kai’s awakening finally allowed Xia Ningshang to relax. She had scarcely rested these days, fearing he would never wake. Now that he was fine, she no longer needed to worry.

In the following two days, Yang Kai rested and cultivated, Xia Ningshang tended to him, and Meng Wuya sighed by their side.

On the third day, Meng Wuya finally issued a strict order to Xia Ningshang: she must first absorb the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, transforming her Primordial Qi into True Essence to advance to the True Essence Realm. Though the Dew had been refined, leaving it idle in the dantian was not wise.

Xia Ningshang did not refuse and obediently complied. Usually, she was a well-behaved girl; the last time she had to secretly drug her master was just a small accident.

Though the three lived in an inn, Meng Wuya’s profound strength ensured no unwelcome visitors dared disturb Xia Ningshang, so he felt safe allowing her to enter seclusion.

Yang Kai was basically out of danger now, though his external wounds and chest bones still required time to heal. Each day he cultivated and meditated, waiting for Xia Ningshang to complete her advancement. Then the three would set out for Lingxiao Pavilion.

One day, while Yang Kai was cultivating, Meng Wuya entered carrying a steaming bowl of soup.

Yang Kai sniffed the aroma and quickly opened his eyes.

Meng Wuya handed the bowl to Yang Kai, biting his teeth with concealed pain. “Drink it.”

Without hesitation, Yang Kai took it and drank it down in one gulp, then belched contentedly. “What is this? The medicinal effect is so strong!”

He could feel a surge of warmth spreading through him as the soup’s vast energy seeped into his flesh and meridians, healing his wounds. Another portion was being absorbed by his Golden Body.

Meng Wuya’s mouth twitched as he mourned, “This is a ginseng soup I brewed using a thousand-year Blood Spirit Ginseng and various rare treasures. Do you think the effect is strong? Damn! This thing is worth a fortune, and you drank it all in one gulp. Could you at least savor the taste?”

“The taste is good!” Yang Kai nodded seriously.

Meng Wuya took a deep breath, calming the turbulent blood qi in his chest. He thought, if it weren’t for his precious disciple’s seclusion requiring this tonic, he wouldn’t have dared to use it. This stuff was a lifesaver—no one in the Great Han Dynasty could find a single root. What a waste!

“Is there any left?” Yang Kai licked his lips, still craving more.

Meng Wuya snapped, “No, even if there were, you wouldn’t get any. Eat any more and you might burst.”

“Heh heh.” Yang Kai laughed, thinking that with the Golden Body supporting him, no matter how much energy or rare treasures he absorbed, he could store it all and truly would not burst.

“Tell me what happened that night,” Meng Wuya suddenly said, his face serious, eyes flashing with long-hidden anger and killing intent.

Yang Kai glanced at him. “Didn’t Junior Sister tell you?”

“She was too busy worrying about your injuries these past days. I didn’t ask,” Meng Wuya said solemnly, his gaze burning into Yang Kai. “Who exactly died in the valley? And who... attacked you all?”
