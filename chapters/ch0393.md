## Chapter 393 — Home with Two Elders

Yang Family.

The news that the two sons had returned first soon spread, with the two Golden Feather Eagles providing the best proof of their return.

A man and a woman were swiftly racing toward the Transformation Dragon Pool.

Both of their expressions were filled with tension, anticipation, and a hint of guilt and pain.

The middle-aged man appeared somewhat calm, forcing himself to be composed, yet his robust figure could not help but tremble slightly, and a hint of joy could even be seen on his meticulous face.

On the contrary, the woman was dashing forward while wiping her eyes, silently crying with tears streaming like rain, her eyes red and puffy.

After running for a while, the middle-aged man could no longer bear it and said in a muffled voice, “Su Zhu, why are you crying? Our son has come back, and we should be happy!”

Dong Suzhu continued to wipe her tears, not even able to speak for a moment. She choked back sobs, saying intermittently, “I… I just can’t help it… You… do you think I want to cry? These tears… just came out on their own, boohoo… It’s really so annoying.”

Yang Yingfeng was utterly speechless: “If our son sees you like this, he might think I’ve been bullying you at home.”

Dong Suzhu immediately became mournful: “Is there no bullying? Tell me, what was that fox spirit from last time? Why did she keep calling you ‘Brother Yang’ over and over, and so affectionately at that! Hmph…”

Her eloquence returned, and the tears seemed to have dried up, quite the opposite from her earlier incoherence.

Fourth Master Yang’s face turned red from embarrassment, and after hesitating for a long time, he mumbled, “It was an accident, it was just an accident…”

“An accident?” Dong Suzhu persisted, looking pitiful. “I married into your Yang Family when I was eighteen, and it’s been almost twenty years. I have endured quite a lot over the years without enjoying any of your Yang Family’s blessings. At my age, I still have to worry about my husband being seduced away by some fox spirit. If I had known this… I wouldn’t have attended that power struggle in Zhongdu, only to encounter a man like you who has no conscience… boohoo…”

While speaking, she continued to wipe her eyes, secretly evaluating Yang Yingfeng's reaction.

“It really was an accident!” Fourth Master Yang's forehead was soon covered in cold sweat. Although Dong Suzhu was no longer young and evidently a woman, it was hard to tell how she had aged. She still looked like a young maiden, as if the long years had left no traces on her face.

Moreover, Dong Suzhu not only looked young; her disposition was also quite lively. She often said things that only young girls would say, creating situations that left people laughing and crying.

Such awkward moments frequently occurred when the couple went out together.

Unfamiliar people would approach and respectfully greet: “Greetings, Sir Fourth Master Yang. Greetings, Miss Yang…”

Yang Yingfeng would often bemusedly ask, “Who is the Miss Yang?”

The guests would politely say, “Isn’t she the daughter of Sir Fourth Master? Truly a case of dragon giving birth to a dragon, phoenix giving birth to a phoenix. She is indeed the daughter of Fourth Master, and Miss Yang is extraordinarily talented, unparalleled in the world…”

As the flattery continued, Fourth Master Yang’s face turned dark.

Dong Suzhu, on the other hand, would have a smiling face as she linked arms with Yang Yingfeng, nodding repeatedly, thoroughly enjoying the moment, as if she wished for more praises to be heaped upon her.

After experiencing this often, Fourth Master Yang also gained some experience. Whenever visiting unfamiliar households, he would boldly introduce himself without waiting for the host to speak: “I am Yang Yingfeng, and this is my wife, Dong Suzhu!”

The host would be instantly put off, thinking that this Fourth Master Yang was quite a peculiar person, evidently afraid that everyone in the world would misunderstand him for eating soft rice. He introduced himself like this to everyone.

Perhaps this was just how the Yang Family people were... so odd.

The thoughts of the direct descendants of a large family were indeed not something easily understood by people like them.

The matter that Dong Suzhu mentioned actually happened three years ago. The woman who had a good impression of Yang Yingfeng had long since vanished, yet Dong Suzhu still clung tightly to it. Every time she felt down, she would bring it up.

What made it worse was that Fourth Master Yang was dull-witted and easily affected!

Clearly, he had done nothing wrong; it was merely that the woman was attracted to his handsome demeanor. Yet, as soon as Dong Suzhu brought it up, Fourth Master Yang would become like a coward, repeatedly apologizing and feeling extremely awkward.

“It really was an accident. Suzhu, don’t think too much. I just helped her a little when she was in trouble; honestly, I’ve only spoken to her no more than three times!” Fourth Master Yang rubbed the cold sweat off his forehead while nervously explaining.

He didn’t know how many times he had explained this…

“Really?” Dong Suzhu sniffed her small nose, her face still stained with tears, “You’re not lying to me?”

“I wouldn’t lie to you, not in this lifetime!” Fourth Master Yang said emphatically, his demeanor serious.

“Brother Fourth, you’re so good.” Dong Suzhu immediately turned her tears into laughter.

Fourth Master Yang smiled shyly, his grin resembling Yang Kai’s in some ways, but lacking Yang Kai’s wickedness and strangeness.

“You wouldn’t tell our son about this, would you?” Fourth Master Yang suddenly had a flash of insight and hurriedly asked.

“Well… that depends on how you behave in the future. If one day I’m not happy, I might just go find our son to chat. You know, chatting, and before you know it, we might bring up something crucial.”

“Ahem…” Fourth Master Yang suddenly felt unwell, thinking that if his tall image fell in his son’s eyes… that would be a disaster.

Speaking of their son, Dong Suzhu’s expression grew serious as she murmured, “I wonder if he has brought a wife back after all these years outside.”

“Not likely. I heard from Tu Feng that he came back all by himself. However, Tu Feng told me it seems there’s a girl who has a good impression of him.”

“How many girls?” Dong Suzhu immediately became interested.

“How many?” Fourth Master Yang raised his brows sharply, suddenly exuding killing intent and said, “Only one is allowed! If he dares to be a playboy, I’ll break his legs!”

Dong Suzhu’s anticipation and smile quickly faded, and she huffed meaningfully, “If you dare to do that, I’ll twist your… legs.”

Yang Yingfeng shrank his neck, feeling bewildered.

How come if he spoke to a girl for three sentences, she wouldn’t let it go for three years, while their son was allowed to be frivolous?

Was this a double standard?

As they approached the edge of the forbidden ground by the Transformation Dragon Pool, Dong Suzhu quickly said, “Hurry, Brother Fourth, help me check if my clothes are orderly and my hair messy, is everything all right like this?”

Fourth Master Yang asked in confusion, “You’re not going for a blind date, so why be so rigorous about it?”

Dong Suzhu pouted: “Meeting our son is much more important than a blind date.”

Fourth Master Yang thought for a moment and felt that his wife had a point and straightened his clothes, saying, “I’m fine, right?”

“Your stubble is a little thick. But it’s no problem.”

“Hmm.” Fourth Master Yang nodded with satisfaction.

The couple stood at the edge of the Transformation Dragon Pool forbidden ground. Holding their breath and keeping silent, they gazed at the thick mist, standing stiffly with solemn expressions as if waiting for a great person to arrive!

After waiting for quite some time, Fourth Master Yang suddenly said, “Wait a moment, Suzhu. Our son should be washing his meridians and refining his marrow in the Transformation Dragon Pool. He must be at least in there for a day or two before he can come out. Why are we here now?”

“Why don’t you go back?” Dong Suzhu suggested.

“Alright, I still have some matters to finish. Once I’m done, I will come find you!” Yang Yingfeng nodded and turned to leave.

After walking just a few steps, he suddenly felt a killing intent approaching from behind, as if tangible, accompanied by two chilling eyes that made his spine shiver.

Fourth Master Yang couldn’t help but shiver and quickly came to a stop, with a serious expression he walked back to stand next to Dong Suzhu, his hands behind his back and his gaze straight ahead with a solemn face.

“What’s wrong?” Dong Suzhu looked at him with a gentle smile, lightly biting her pearly teeth.

Fourth Master Yang sniffed and mumbled, “I suddenly feel that it's better to wait here anyway; those matters aren’t important. They can be handled at any time.”

“I can wait here alone,” Dong Suzhu looked at Yang Yingfeng with tremendous tenderness, her expression gentle and understanding, “You go do your thing, don’t worry about us. Once our son comes out, I’ll take him to the Dong Family. There’s no need to participate in whatever power struggle.”

“No way.” Fourth Master Yang shook his head like a rattle drum, “It’s better for me to wait.”

……

Inside the Transformation Dragon Pool, half a day later.

Yang Kai could no longer stand it.

The Transformation Dragon Pool had no effect on him; he could only wait here while operating the True Yang Technique, which was a bit faster than his usual cultivation speed, but not incredibly so. If it were any other time, he would have pretended to stay longer before leaving.

But thinking of his two elders waiting at home, Yang Kai felt a sense of urgency.

He quietly glanced to the other side and found Yang Zhao still in the same posture. He could not help but shook his head gently, his body leaping out from the Transformation Dragon Pool.

In mid-air, he operated his True Essence, drying the water on his body before landing steadily.

Xiao Zhengqing and the other three looked at Yang Kai in astonishment.

As they said, the Transformation Dragon Pool was a place that could test a person’s talent; the better the talent, the longer they could stay within the pool, and the more benefits they would gain.

Having guarded this place for many years, they had seen many Yang Family disciples enter the Transformation Dragon Pool; even the one with the worst talent had stayed for a full day and night before coming out.

But this one was different; he went in hastily and came out in less than half a day.

Such performance was truly embarrassing.

Xiao Zhengqing and two others were of high generation and held considerable status in the Yang Family, naturally not needing to show Yang Kai any courtesy, especially since they had never thought highly of him.

“Is that all it takes for you to come out?” one sneered, his expression filled with disdain.

Yang Kai frowned; although displeased, he didn’t reply and asked instead, “Do you have any instructions?”

“No! You can return to your residence,” Xiao Zhengqing said casually.

Yang Kai nodded, cupped his fists in thanks to the three, turned, and strode away.

He seemed to hear light laughter behind him, but Yang Kai paid no mind.
