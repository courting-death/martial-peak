## Chapter 1473 — Haicheng City

In the blink of an eye, the once arrogant Xuanjing Ink-Octopus met its end on the spot, its massive body chopped into bits and pieces, its death pitiful beyond measure.

Having escaped death, the woman—whose affiliation was unknown—knew at once she had struck luck; was she rescued from the brink of life and death by a master? Steadying herself, she hurriedly cried out in a coquettish voice, "May I ask which senior has graced us with his presence? Tianxuan Sect's Xiao Luo offers her thanks to the senior for saving our lives."

The other four snapped back to their senses, offering respectful thanks while scanning the surroundings for any trace of the newcomer.

A gust of wind swept by, dispersing the dark green mist that shrouded the coral. Not far away stood a tall, broad-shouldered youth, his expression faintly strange, and in his eyes flickered a trace of wistful remembrance.

So young? The few were astonished. They had expected someone older—someone who could easily slay a Sixth-Tier peak sea beast—but he looked about the same age as themselves.

Yet this was clearly not his true age; the higher a warrior's power, the more slowly their life force wanes, so many supreme experts always appear youthful.

Thinking this, the five became even more respectful. Led by a burly man, they flew over to Yang Kai and bowed once more in thanks.

"A trifling matter, not worth mentioning," Yang Kai said lightly. Looking at their disheveled expressions and at the corpse of the Seventh-Tier sea beast below, he recalled having been weak once—yet as his power grew, a Seventh-Tier peak sea beast would not last a single breath under him.

Time really does fly! And... I'm actually a Senior now.

Yang Kai suddenly felt like laughing.

As his thoughts shifted, noting their guarded expressions and guessing what they feared, he didn't bother with idle chatter and asked, "Is this the Wuyou Sea?"

The five exchanged glances. The leader nodded and said, "Senior, yes, this is indeed the Wuyou Sea."

"As I thought..." Yang Kai's face darkened. Although he had suspected it, he hadn't expected that stepping out of the Imperial Garden would actually send him to the Wuyou Sea.

"Senior, are you from the inland?" Xiao Luo suddenly asked.

"Luo'er!" The leader's face changed greatly. He couldn't help but scold her—though he didn't know Yang Kai's cultivation, from the way he had killed the Xuanjing Ink-Octopus it was obvious he could wipe them out without effort.

Gratitude for saving their lives was one thing; vigilance was another. Before understanding this person's disposition and temper, rashly prying could easily provoke him.

Moreover, they had two beautiful Junior Sisters with them; if the newcomer were a lecher, trouble could easily ensue. With that thought, the leader grew tense and glanced at Yang Kai, seeing that he showed no anger and even regarded his Junior Sister with some interest.

"How do you know I'm from the inland?" Yang Kai asked.

“Because people who live long years on the Wuyou Sea tend to have darker skin, and there’s always a faint water aura about them — but you don’t, Senior,” the young girl named Xiao Luo replied openly.

"I see." Yang Kai smiled faintly. After a quick inspection, he found she was right: all five bore a faint water-qi and slightly darker skin, not obvious unless examined closely. When exposed, Yang Kai did not deny it and nodded readily, "Indeed, I came from inland. But I got lost—do you know which direction returns to the inland, and how long it would take?"

…

Half a cup of tea later, Yang Kai summoned the Star Shuttle and sped off in a certain direction.

After questioning the five disciples of the Tianxuan Sect, Yang Kai found his luck was not entirely rotten: they were still in the outer reaches of the Wuyou Sea, not the inner sea, so the inland was not too far. At his speed, he could reach the inland in three to five days.

However, flying back to the Flowing Flame Sandland was simply unrealistic — the distance was far too great. Relying on flight alone would take at least half a year!

Yang Kai had no interest in spending large stretches of time on the road.

So he planned to find a city and make use of a Space Array.

Fortunately, not far from the Wuyou Sea stood a Haicheng City, a junction between the inland and the Wuyou Sea; many warriors came and went, and the city's Space Array was open to outsiders, though it required a substantial amount of Saint Crystals.

Each use charged according to distance; the minimum was ten thousand Saint Crystals, and the maximum was three hundred thousand.

Such prices were hard for ordinary warriors to bear, but for Yang Kai they were nothing.

Five days later, Yang Kai arrived at Haicheng City. The city was truly large—easily more than twice the size of Tianyun City—with cultivators arriving and departing like schools of fish, shoulder to shoulder.

After all, although the inland and the overseas are both parts of the Dark Star, regional differences produced different goods: many cultivation resources absent inland could be found overseas with ease, and vice versa.

As a junction, Haicheng City had already become the most famous commercial city within a one million li radius.

Yang Kai had no desire to linger. After some inquiry, he learned the location of the Space Array and headed straight there.

Haicheng City's streets were incredibly broad, wide enough for several four-horse carriages abreast, and the shops along the road stood in endless rows, dazzling the eye.

As he hurried toward his destination, a commotion drifted to his ears.

"You lowly wench, with only two thousand Saint Crystals you expect to buy a Spiritual Pill? Are you even awake? If you don't leave I'll make you—"

"But I only have two thousand Saint Crystals, Shopkeeper Cheng. We've dealt business these past years, though the values were small—I'm trustworthy. Please, show mercy and sell me the pill; I'll make up the shortfall later. I still need to make a living in Haicheng City; I won't run away."

"What a joke. I do business: cash for goods. I'm no charity. No Saint Crystals? Get gone. Want a Spiritual Pill? Dream on!"

"Shopkeeper Cheng, I beg you."

"Impossible. One last warning—leave now or suffer the consequences!"

The voices came from a man and a woman. The man was the proprietor of a medicine shop; the woman appeared about forty, once fair in looks but now sallow and gaunt, clearly fallen on hard times. She pleaded with Shopkeeper Cheng, but he remained unmoved.

Yang Kai stared at the woman's profile for a long moment, then uttered a soft "ah," a thoughtful expression flickering across his face.

He felt he ought to know the woman, though he couldn't be certain; her voice and profile were very familiar.

With that thought, Yang Kai stepped forward.

The proprietor, who had just been fierce, immediately switched to a fawning manner upon seeing Yang Kai and smiled broadly, "Guest, what would you like? Though small, our shop sells only premium Spiritual Pills—used for healing and recovering cultivation—everything you need. Please have a look."

Yang Kai glanced at him without interest, moving to the woman's side to scrutinize her. After a moment he tentatively asked, "Are you Guest Elder Huang?"

The woman, on the verge of tears and already resolved to leave, changed expression upon hearing Yang Kai and looked up to see him regarding her with curiosity.

In an instant her delicate body trembled, terror and astonishment flashing across her face.

"So it really is Guest Elder Huang!" Yang Kai nodded lightly. Though she appeared wretched, she was indeed the person he remembered, and from her reaction she clearly also recognized him.

Huang Juan—once a Guest Elder of the Haike Family—had been an old acquaintance of Chang Qi and Hao An.

Back then, when Yang Kai quarreled with the Haike Family, Huang Juan had gone to the city lord's mansion on Family Head Ian's orders to seek aid. Unfortunately, Fei Zhi Tu declined to intervene and kept his distance, so Huang Juan had no choice but to return to her family; later she left the Haike Family and vanished.

Yang Kai had heard of her from Chang Qi and Hao An, so he had some impression of her; he knew she had refused to go against Wu Yi and others, and so had left without hesitation.

She had once been close with Wu Yi, and over the years Chang Qi and Hao An often reminisced about their old friend—Huang Juan was the one they mentioned most.

It was unclear why she had come to Haicheng City, or why she had fared so poorly.

Then again, it was hardly surprising: her cultivation was only the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm, which ranked well within the Haike Family but meant little across the Dark Star. Without backing or background, a lone woman at the Third Stage of the Saint King Realm found it difficult to survive.

"You are Yang Kai?" Huang Juan clearly remembered him. "What brings you here?"

"That's a long story," Yang Kai said, slowly shaking his head, not wanting to go into detail. "But Guest Elder, how did you come to be here?"

"I came here long ago," Huang Juan replied, her expression flickering with embarrassment. "At the time I was only following orders, so..."

"I know—don't worry. I'm not here to cause trouble. Are you poisoned?" Yang Kai frowned as he watched a trace of black qi drifting across her brows.

Huang Juan looked astonished, clearly not expecting Yang Kai to have seen through her condition at a glance.

"No wonder you wanted to buy a Spiritual Pill," Yang Kai nodded lightly.

"You've made me look shameful," Huang Juan said, her face filled with awkward embarrassment; being exposed in such an ignominious predicament was truly humiliating.
