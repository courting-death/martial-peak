## Chapter 1519 — Secrets of Star Emperor Mountain

In a secret underground chamber, a rip in space opened and Yang Kai stumbled out of it, his face still showing traces of lingering terror.

Fang Peng was well aware he could tear open space, yet he had still prepared such a cruel trap; partly because he probably knew the Leitai Sect’s main headquarters could not be saved, so rather than let it fall for free he might as well make use of it, and partly because he harbored a sliver of hope—perhaps Yang Kai would be slow to react and perish amid the riot of the Xuanbao Crystals.

It was just unclear how much confidence he actually had!

No matter what, Fang Peng’s plan had already failed; at the moment before the Xuanbao Crystals erupted, Yang Kai had already left the center of the explosive vortex and followed the direction from which the formation had been sourced, delving deep underground.

This was a place ten thousand zhang underground, where dim lights flickered all around. On the ground lay five people, sprawled haphazardly, breathing in more than they breathed out.

Yang Kai could see at a glance that they would not live long, and his brow tightened.

It seemed the commotion just now had been caused by these five. After all, a great sect that had endured for over ten thousand years would, in its direst hour, still have those willing to remain and die with the sect, sacrificing their lives.

“You truly didn’t die—Fang Peng was not wrong!” came a faint, feeble voice from beside him. Yang Kai looked up and saw a gaunt, yellow-faced old man staring at him from where he lay, his cracked lips trembling; there was resentment and disbelief on his face. “Spatial Force lives up to its name!”

“Senior flatters me!” Yang Kai snorted coldly and strode forward, stopping five steps before him. “Knowing such petty tricks couldn’t possibly kill me, Fang Peng still sent you five to stay behind and die. What grand courage!”

The yellow-faced old man gave a hoarse laugh, breath hanging by a thread. “It wasn’t that he forced us to stay—we chose to remain. Boy, at a time like this you still want to sow discord?”

A flicker of something crossed Yang Kai’s eyes, but he said nothing.

The old man coughed lightly and continued, “The five of us were already short on life; if we could drag you down with us to join the burial, then it would be a great gain—one last thing done for the sect before we die. So even knowing the hope was slim, we had to gamble.”

“You’re all about to die—what’s the point of so much talk?” Yang Kai said indifferently, his interest waning. “Tell me where Fang Peng went, and I’ll leave you a whole corpse.”

“Heh. You’re blunt and quick. Had I met you years ago, I might have seen you in a different light! Fang Peng said… he said…”

“He said what?”

“He said… to go to Star Emperor Mountain… and find him!” The yellow-faced old man seemed to squeeze out the very last of his life as he forced the words through his lips. Once he finished speaking, his breath ceased entirely.

The other four had already passed away while Yang Kai was speaking with the yellow-faced elder.

Frowning as he looked at the five corpses, Yang Kai slowly shook his head, feeling no urge to disturb them. Reaching out, he drew a line through the air before him, and space itself was instantly torn open.

…

In Lei Feng Canyon, a warship hovered in midair with its hatch thrown open. Ye Xijun and the others had all rushed out, their faces anxious and worried as they stared ahead.

The explosion had subsided, but where the magnificence of the Leitai Sect’s main headquarters had once stood, only a ruin remained: a pit dozens of zhang deep and covering an area of dozens of li.

Yang Kai was nowhere to be seen!

Everyone’s hearts leapt to their throats.

Had it not been for the warship guarding them from that energy upheaval, everyone present would likely have died—let alone Yang Kai, who had plunged into the epicenter.

Each person worried for him, fearing Yang Kai had perished within.

“Looking for me?” a sudden voice came from behind. Everyone started and turned to see Yang Kai, who had somehow appeared a short distance behind them, standing unharmed.

Expressions became peculiarly strange; none of them had sensed Yang Kai’s arrival, as if he had manifested out of thin air.

“Yang Kai, are you all right?” Qian Tong asked anxiously.

“I’m fine. Come aboard first and we’ll talk.” Yang Kai stepped into the warship, signaling them to follow.

After a moment, the warship turned and flew out of Lei Feng Canyon.

Onboard, Yang Kai briefly recounted the outcome of his excursion. Listening, the others could not help but feel a surge of emotion.

“Those five were likely the Leitai Sect’s Grand Elders. They were old men, perhaps a generation or two above Old Fei and me!” Qian Tong said softly. “Every great power has such figures. Yingyue Hall has several as well, but they do not meddle in worldly affairs; they seclude themselves in long-term retreats and will not emerge unless something catastrophic occurs—otherwise they die quietly in seclusion.”

“Indeed; though they were our enemies, their actions are worthy of respect,” Fei Zhi Tu nodded slightly.

“Whether they’re worthy of respect or not, Fang Peng has fled to Star Emperor Mountain, so I won’t waste more time hunting him,” Yang Kai snorted. If Fang Peng were to change his name and go into hiding it would be troublesome, but of all places he could run to, he had chosen Star Emperor Mountain—just what Yang Kai wanted.

The warship’s next destination was Star Emperor Mountain!

Fang Peng had likely expected as much and so went there to wait.

“Great Elder,” Yang Kai looked up at Ye Xijun, “at this point, there shouldn’t be anything left for you to conceal. I’ve never asked about Star Emperor Mountain before—but now, I want to know everything, and the more detailed, the better.”

“I never intended to conceal anything—it’s just that Sect Master had never asked before.” Ye Xijun brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. “Since Sect Master wishes to know, I will naturally hold nothing back and tell all that I know.”

“Good.” Yang Kai nodded in satisfaction.

“Uh… Yang Kai, should Old Fei and I step out?” Qian Tong hesitated. Hearing Yang Kai and Ye Xijun’s exchange, it seemed they were about to speak of Star Emperor Mountain’s secrets; he felt awkward staying.

“No need. You are not outsiders.” Yang Kai waved his hand.

“Then… very well.” Qian Tong relented and, no longer insisting, he and Fei Zhi Tu turned to Ye Xijun and assumed attentive expressions. They were intensely curious about Star Emperor Mountain; despite its mystery, it was undeniably the top power on Dark Star.

“Where to begin…” Ye Xijun’s brows knitted as she chose her words. After a moment she continued, “Rumor has it Star Emperor Mountain is connected to the Emperor. This is not baseless; it is indeed so. In truth, Star Emperor Mountain is a surviving branch of the Taixuan Sect!”

“A remnant of the Taixuan Sect?” Yang Kai gaped.

“Yes.”

“Taixuan Sect?” Qian Tong frowned. “What sort of sect is that? I have never heard of it.”

Fei Zhi Tu shook his head slowly as well, indicating he too had never heard of it.

Yang Kai grinned. “The place Lingxiao Sect now occupies is the site of the Taixuan Sect. That ancient sect vanished tens of thousands of years ago; no wonder you two have never heard of it.”

“So that’s how it is!” Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu both showed expressions of sudden realization.

“Please continue, Great Elder.” Yang Kai gestured.

“Taixuan Sect had been the Great Emperor’s own sect, built and guided from the ground up. Yet its fortune rose and fell alongside the Great Emperor’s. One day, an old enemy came uninvited; their dispute turned into battle. The enemy was destroyed, but the Great Emperor sank into a long sleep. That place eventually turned into the Flowing Flame Sandland. Sect Master should already know this tale.”

“Yes, I have heard of it.” Yang Kai nodded lightly.

He appeared calm; he had already heard such rumors and was not surprised. Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu, however, stared wide-eyed, their breathing quickening in astonishment.

Though Ye Xijun had spoken little, they gleaned a significant portion of the truth.

The Starry Sky Emperor, said in legend to have eyes and hands that reached the heavens, actually had an opponent capable of matching such power! In that battle, the enemy was slain, yet it seemed the Great Emperor did not emerge unscathed.

Could that enemy have shared the Emperor’s cultivation realm? Such a notion was terrifying.

The two fought once, and the Flowing Flame Sandland appeared on Dark Star as a result…

Moreover, from Ye Xijun’s words it seemed the Emperor still lived, only fallen into slumber.

As a figure of legend, the name of the Starry Sky Emperor was deeply rooted in the hearts of all. That power was beyond dispute—said to pluck stars and summon the moon, to destroy a cultivation star with ease, and to traverse an entire Star Domain within a single day.

There were far too many legends about the Great Emperor, each more unbelievable than the last. Though Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu both held deep reverence for that figure, neither had ever imagined that such a being of unimaginable power might still walk the world.

Hearing this secret now, their shock was overwhelming and they remained stunned for a long while.

Only because Ye Xijun spoke did they give it any credence; had others said it, they likely would have scoffed.

“Whatever the outcome of that battle, the Taixuan Sect was ravaged and suffered devastating losses. Few survived, and those who did fled elsewhere; they became the founders of Star Emperor Mountain!” Ye Xijun’s voice pulled Qian Tong and Fei Zhi Tu back to their senses.

“In Star Emperor Mountain there is a portrait—a portrait of the Emperor—which is why that day…” Ye Xijun trailed off, not finishing her sentence.

Yang Kai knew what she meant.

Her immediate conviction upon seeing Yang Yan was because of that ancient portrait; she believed Yang Yan to be the Emperor for the resemblance she had observed for centuries.

Over hundreds of years Ye Xijun had examined the Emperor’s features up close countless times.

“The ancient precept of Star Emperor Mountain has always been clear: its existence is solely for the Great Emperor. One day, the Great Emperor will awaken again, and when that time comes, Star Emperor Mountain will serve as the Emperor’s right and left hand. For tens of thousands of years, every generation of Star Emperor Mountain’s masters has held to this belief—never meddling in worldly disputes or outside grudges, only waiting for the day of the Great Emperor’s return. I have led Star Emperor Mountain for hundreds of years with the same conviction.”
