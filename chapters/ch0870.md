## Chapter 870 — Blood Essence Stone

Deep into the night, the snowy mountains were unusually cold.

Yet the members of the Ancient Demon Clan were utterly unfazed; many lay on the snow bare‑chested, savoring the chill of the packed snow.

Feathery snow drifted down from the sky, and they watched in wonder, scooping up the falling flakes and shouting with delight.

Everything outside felt utterly novel to them.

Yang Kai sat cross‑legged in a corner, refining and absorbing the spiritual remnants of those who had died in the battle, assimilating their insights into the Dao of Martial Arts for himself.

"Master." Li Rong approached and called softly.

Yang Kai lifted his eyelids and looked up. "What is it?"

"I found something very strange."

"What is it?"

Li Rong hurriedly handed over what she held.

The moment Yang Kai took it, an unusual sensation rose in his hand. He stared in surprise at an irregular stone, about the size of a fist, its entire surface blood‑red.

His sight was not poor; having studied alchemy, he had some knowledge of this world's rare treasures and spiritual herbs and medicines.

Still, he could not identify what this stone was.

It was crimson, damp to the touch as if just fished from water, yet no liquid stained his palm.

Most peculiar to Yang Kai was the fact that a surging force of qi and blood pulsed within the stone.

If one listened closely, one could even hear the faint sound of running water from inside.

A thick metallic tang of blood hung at his nostrils.

"Where did you find it?" Yang Kai asked suspiciously.

"It was in the spatial pouch that man just gave me."

She meant Zhang Ao.

Yang Kai's expression shifted. "You couldn't identify it?"

Li Rong shook her head slowly and mused, "Perhaps Commander Hua Mo can identify it—he's the eldest in our clan…" She sent out a sliver of divine sense as she spoke.

At her call, the Ancient Demon Clan's several commanders gathered.

The crimson stone passed through their hands, and each shook their head; none had seen such a strange rock. Like Yang Kai, they all noticed that thick blood smell, as if the stone contained a great deal of blood.

"Saint Lord…may I take a look?" Wu Jie suddenly asked.

Yang Kai casually tossed the strange stone to him.

Wu Jie caught it and examined it carefully. Then a wisp of True Yuan sparked at his fingertip, producing a peculiar pulling force. Under its influence, a ribbon of scarlet blood was drawn out from the stone.

Seeing this, the Ancient Demon Clan's commanders widened their eyes.

Wu Jie nodded slightly and handed the stone back. "If I'm not mistaken, this should be a Blood Essence Stone!"

"Blood Essence Stone?" Yang Kai frowned. Li Rong and the others looked equally unfamiliar.

"If so, what Zhang Ao said before he died might be true…" Wu Jie pondered. "I thought he was trying to lure the Saint Lord and make trouble behind the scenes."

"You mean the thing he mentioned about the starry sky?"

"Exactly." Wu Jie answered gravely. "Because the Blood Essence Stone is not native to the Tongxuan Continent—it comes from the starry sky!"

Yang Kai's eyes brightened.

The starry sky was a legend on this continent; no one had truly reached it.

Yang Kai and Zhai Yao had once gone to the starry sky via the Thousand‑Year Demon Flower and stayed there for a year, but the starry sky was vast and they could not explore much before Yang Kai ascended to the Transcendent Realm and returned.

"Saint Lord, are you aware that peculiar products from the starry sky occasionally appear on the continent?"

"Of course, I've seen some myself." Yang Kai nodded.

When he had been involved with the Leiguang Divine Cult, Du Wan had once produced a strange stone from the starry sky that resisted the soul‑shattering power of the Wind Eye. Unfortunately, that stone shattered afterward.

"Most of those unique products are odd stones, perhaps drifting from the starry sky into our world. Some are worthless, ordinary rocks, but others are priceless—this Blood Essence Stone is one of the latter."

"How do you know that?" Yang Kai asked curiously.

Wu Jie shrugged. "I once knew someone who possessed such a stone, though his was smaller than this one."

"What does it do?"

"Saint Lord, you might pour True Yuan into it; you'll see what it does!" Wu Jie smiled enigmatically.

Yang Kai did not ask further. Gripping the Blood Essence Stone, he poured True Yuan into it with abandon.

In an instant, crimson light surged forth, so vivid it made the heart flutter, and that color filled the surrounding space.

A strange power emanated from within the stone. Under its influence, blood that had been absorbed into the snow seemed to come alive, writhing like spirit serpents.

Visible to the naked eye, subtle channels opened in the snow.

Sss, sss, sss…

Tens of thousands of tiny rivulets of blood shot from a range of more than ten li, all drilling into the Blood Essence Stone.

The Ancient Demon Clan's commanders watched this bloody yet magnificent sight in astonishment.

Those spurting threads of blood were clearly from the bodies of those who had died in the battle; now they were all being swallowed by the stone.

It was like a bottomless pit—no matter how much blood it took, it never filled.

As the flood of blood entered, the stone's vivid red glow intensified, and an even stronger stench of blood spread.

After a long while, the crimson light gradually waned, and the surrounding blood flow ceased. The snow that had been stained red returned to pristine white as if it had never been sullied.

Yang Kai watched with interest.

In that moment, the Blood Essence Stone seemed almost alive, radiating vigorous vitality.

With a movement of his mind, Yang Kai pulled forth a strand of energy from the stone; it was pink in color, like curling cooking smoke drawn into his nostrils.

Yang Kai felt his own qi and blood surge. His flesh and cells rejoiced, filled with explosive power.

"This thing…" Yang Kai's eyes shone with delight as he called to Li Rong, "Bring any severely wounded clansmen over!"

Li Rong nodded and hurried away.

A moment later she returned, leading a clansman with an amputated arm.

Even with his arm severed in battle, the Ancient Demon still wore a placid expression, not making a sound; blood still poured from the stump, making the sight grievous.

"I pay respects to the Master!" the clan member kneeled hastily.

Li Rong and the others had explained Yang Kai's identity and relationship with the Ancient Demon Clan to the people, and the clansmen accepted it.

"Stand up. Where is your severed arm?" Yang Kai asked.

"Thrown away." The clansman answered bluntly, as if it were a worthless thing, and looked at Yang Kai puzzledly, not understanding the question.

"Where did you throw it?" Yang Kai's face darkened. "Go fetch it back."

"Oh." The man was straightforward; he asked no questions and set off in the indicated direction to retrieve his arm.

Han Fei's brow furrowed. "Saint Lord, you don't mean to…reattach his arm?"

"Let's try." Yang Kai chuckled. "This thing contains powerful life force, qi and blood—maybe it can reconnect the arm."

He glanced at Wu Jie. "The Blood Essence Stone does have that effect, right?"

Wu Jie gave an awkward laugh. "I only know it has powerful healing properties and aids those who cultivate blood‑type techniques and martial skills. Whether it can actually reattach a severed arm, I don't know."

"It doesn't only aid those who cultivate blood arts and martial skills; anyone can use it." Yang Kai nodded slightly, studying the stone in his hand. "A product of the starry sky—remarkable. That breath of blood energy made me feel stronger. In battle, it might allow surprising reversals and turn defeat into victory!"

Hearing him, everyone showed interest in the Blood Essence Stone.

After a while, the clansman returned with his severed arm.

But so much time had passed that the arm had grown cold and stiff, ghastly like a ghostly hand.

The cut was clean, likely severed by a sharp blade—convenient for reconnecting.

Yang Kai instructed him to hold his arm himself, and he drew out the dense blood energy from the Blood Essence Stone, laying it over the stump.

The pink blood energy writhed like an earthworm, continuously pouring into the wound.

Everyone watched without blinking—part incredulous, part eagerly hopeful.

At first the clansman looked unconcerned. Reattaching a severed limb was beyond even top experts at the Third Stage of the Saint Realm; with only the Ninth Stage of the Divine Roaming Realm and a strong body, it seemed impossible that a lost arm could be rejoined.

So he held no real hope and complied only because Yang Kai had ordered it.

But as the blood energy flowed in, the man's nonchalance gave way to astonishment, then rapturous excitement. His widened eyes filled with eager expectation; his body trembled as if he could not contain his elation.

The previously cold, rigid severed arm warmed under the blood energy; the stump tingled as if ants were gnawing at it, and he could even faintly feel his fingers.

He tried moving his middle finger and indeed managed a slight motion.

Seeing this, everyone's faces lit up, their hope growing.

Time passed slowly as Yang Kai continued to draw blood energy from the stone and pour it into the severed arm.

Gradually the wound healed at a pace visible to the naked eye. Half an hour later there remained only a thin scar; it was impossible to tell the arm had ever been severed.
