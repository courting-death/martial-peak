## Chapter 1855 — Night Visit to Purple Star Palace

Night was deep, the moon was waning, and clouds lay thick.

In a side chamber of the Commerce Guild's rear courtyard, Yang Kai, who had been meditating, suddenly opened his eyes; he made a spatial sigil with his hand, Spatial Force rippled about him, and in the next moment he vanished.

A moment later, near the inner city, Yang Kai appeared in the darkness.

He had been in Purple Star City for two days; although he had been delayed briefly by matters with the Commerce Guild, he had not forgotten his original purpose here, and so he planned to attempt tonight to sneak into Purple Star Palace and steal the Star Emperor Token.

If he truly succeeded, he would leave at once; whatever hidden currents surged in Purple Star City would be none of his concern.

As for those people from the Commerce Guild, at worst he would take them along as well; Yang Kai would never leave them behind to carry the blame for him.

Purple Star City was divided into outer and inner cities: the outer city could be entered by any warrior so long as a certain amount of Saint Crystals was paid, while the inner city was reserved only for those belonging to Purple Star, and it was the most prosperous, affluent district of the city.

Numerous Purple Star elders, Protectors, Deacons, and various major figures all dwelt within the inner city, each occupying favourable ground and enjoying boundless cultivation resources.

In the inner city there was a sentry every three steps and a post every five, the defences exceptionally strict.

Yet before a warrior of Yang Kai's calibre those defences were little more than a sham; he did not even need to deliberately use Spatial Force—simply wrapping himself in Divine Sense he could swagger into the inner city, and the guards, even when brushing past him at close range, seemed unaware.

The cultivators within the inner city were generally of much higher cultivation; as Yang Kai walked he felt a chill inside, sensing more than one Void King Realm expert, each like a dormant lion entrenched on its turf, any stirring would alarm them.

Fortunately Yang Kai's Divine Sense was extraordinarily strong, so he could always avoid danger in advance and conceal himself well.

He moved through the night, his steps quickening and slowing, his figure flickering without stirring any force fluctuations, and soon he neared a row of immense palaces at the very centre of the inner city.

Purple Star Palace!

The symbol of Purple Star's power, a sacred place revered by countless Purple Star warriors.

The entire palace group was built of violet jade, magnificent beyond measure; from afar Purple Star Palace resembled a sweep of violet qi drifting in from the east, as if the sun might rise the next moment and bathe the land in light.

Yang Kai lightly released his Divine Sense, examining the surroundings of Purple Star Palace. He muttered under his breath, “Heaven Five, Earth Six, Water Ten, Fire Twelve… Mm, this side is correct.”

He shifted his footing and quickly moved in a certain direction. Before long, he arrived at a spot where the barrier’s energy was weakest. Yang Kai let out a satisfied smile, his figure turning into a streak of light as he shot straight through that weak point.

To have entered Purple Star Palace so smoothly, Zi Donglai was unquestionably of great assistance.

Though Purple Star Palace was vast, a powerful barrier ringed its exterior; without a special token one could not enter, and any forcible intrusion would trigger the barrier's reaction. With Zi Donglai's guidance matters were different—he, as Purple Star's Young Master, having long resided in the palace, knew the barrier's weaknesses like the back of his hand.

As the saying went, a thief within is hard to guard against; truly there was reason for that proverb.

Within Purple Star Palace the restriction devices were few but each was supremely powerful and hidden to the extreme; since Yang Kai intended to act stealthily he of course did not want to expose his position, and Zi Donglai proved most useful.

Before coming, Yang Kai had intentionally questioned Zi Donglai about the palace's setups; Zi Donglai naturally dared not conceal anything, yet he admitted that although he knew most of the palace's restrictions and barriers he did not understand them in full, for those matters usually had specialists in charge and as Young Master he had no leisure to manage them.

Nevertheless, that intelligence was sufficient; Yang Kai believed that so long as he was not excessively unlucky, there should be no major slip-ups.

He observed the surroundings while avoiding restrictions and barriers, quietly approaching a palace at the very centre of Purple Star Palace.

That was Purple Star's Treasure Vault, its defences the most severe in the palace; yet it was also the place Yang Kai could most easily breach, because Zi Donglai knew its situation thoroughly and Yang Kai possessed the key to open the Treasure Vault.

Therefore, so long as he could approach that palace, the main objective would be within reach.

Time passed slowly, progress went smoothly, and Yang Kai inched closer to the palace.

With only a third of the distance remaining, Yang Kai, walking through the void, suddenly grew grave and halted; in that instant he felt he had touched some restriction, and an invisible ripple of force thundered outward.

Damn! Yang Kai's face turned grey—he had never expected the palace's restrictions to be arranged so covertly that even his Divine Sense failed to notice.

The next moment Yang Kai sensed two powerful Divine Senses sweeping toward him.

Those two Divine Senses were the sort only Void King Realm experts could possess; evidently someone had detected the disturbance.

Even Yang Kai, skilled and bold, could not help feeling his scalp prickle; though he excelled in Spatial Force and himself was a Second Stage of the Void King Realm, this place was another's lair with countless masters, and the advantage of heaven and earth did not favour him—if he were entangled, whether he could break free was uncertain.

He did not dare dawdle; he flashed and prepared to teleport away.

But at that moment a Domain Field's might pressed down from nowhere; its power seemed able to seal space itself, Yang Kai's body involuntarily paused and he could not immediately leave.

"What audacious vermin, daring to run wild in my Purple Star Palace!" a furious roar carried forth, shaking the palace's cultivators. Immediately above Yang Kai a vast vortex appeared, and from within it a palm the size of the heavens and earth suddenly descended.

"Second Stage of the Void King Realm!" Yang Kai's eyelids narrowed as he instantly judged the true calibre of the attacker.

The opponent was not present there yet struck across the void—such an ability was beyond a First Stage of the Void King Realm; only those who had steeped for years at Second Stage could possess such means.

The palm, formed from converging energy, slammed down; from its centre seemed to emanate endless suction, wishing to draw Yang Kai in and prevent his escape.

This was without a doubt a secret technique of tremendous power. Back when he was still at the First Stage, Yang Kai might not have been able to block it so easily. But now he too was a Second Stage expert, equal in Realm to the attacker—naturally, he no longer feared the other party.

He did not resist—instead he vaulted forward to meet the massive palm.

Midair, Yang Kai flicked out Golden Blood Threads; dozens of Golden Blood Threads converged into a golden brilliance that surged ahead, with Yang Kai close behind.

A thunderous crash shook the heavens and earth.

The golden radiance pierced the giant palm; that terrifying palm imprint suddenly dispersed and collapsed, and the force sealing the sky and earth vanished.

Yang Kai immediately executed a spatial secret art and disappeared from that spot.

The next moment three figures arrived at the scene one after another; the first was an elder with a long beard down to his chest, hair streaked white, his face grim, his bearing naturally imposing—his eyes held astonishment as he scanned about.

The two who followed, a man and a woman, before they could ascertain what had occurred saw the elder standing aloof in the void and immediately their expressions froze as they cupped their fists and said in unison, "Great Elder!"

That elder was none other than Purple Star's Great Elder, Gongsun Liang!

Counted among the Star Domain's notable Second Stage of the Void King Realm experts, his aura and momentum were imposing, in no way inferior to Purple Star's master Zi Long.

"Great Elder, earlier—" the female Void King Realm expert hesitated and asked.

"Someone trespassed into Purple Star Palace!" Gongsun Liang said in a low, fierce voice.

"What?" the other male Void King Realm expert's face changed. "Who dares be so presumptuous?"

"I do not know!" Gongsun Liang shook his head and squinted. "Their strength was great; they managed to break my Void-Extinguishing Palm with a single move—that is no ordinary feat."

The two Void King Realm experts exchanged a glance, each seeing the shock reflected in the other’s eyes.

Earlier they had been at some distance; though they had sensed the energy fluctuation, they had not seen precisely what occurred. Only now did they realise the intruder had exchanged blows with the Great Elder and even shattered his Void-Extinguishing Palm.

The female Void King Realm expert hesitated and said, "Does that not mean the other was a Second Stage expert?"

At her words she herself was startled—if a Second Stage expert truly meant Purple Star Palace harm then the trouble would be grave. Apart from the Great Elder, the others here were only First Stage.

First Stage and Second Stage—that was a chasm as wide as heaven and earth!

"Whether he was Second Stage I cannot yet discern—the speed of his strike and withdrawal was extraordinarily swift, and the speed of his escape..." Gongsun Liang knit his brows together, unable to believe the man had vanished beneath his nose; no matter how he urged his Divine Sense, he detected no trace.

It was as if the earlier scene had been a farce he staged himself.

While they spoke, yet more experts were alarmed and hurried over.

Even Zi Wuji arrived here accompanied by Ji Jun.

"Second Young Master!" the crowd greeted Zi Wuji as they pressed forward; although everyone knew the next master of Purple Star would be Zi Donglai, Zi Wuji was still Zi Long's son, and that face must be shown.

Only Gongsun Liang stood there, impudent and unbothered.

"Wuji pays respects to the Great Elder!" instead it was Zi Wuji who had to salute Gongsun Liang.

After all, he was not Purple Star's Young Master; if Zi Donglai had been present the situation would have been different.

Gongsun Liang showed no reaction beyond a slight nod, his demeanour haughty.

Seeing his manner, a sliver of cold light flashed across Zi Wuji's eyes and he smiled faintly. “Great Elder, what has happened here? Why did I sense someone making a move?”

Gongsun Liang pretended not to hear, as if he had no intention of responding.

Everyone’s expressions shifted several times, and the atmosphere instantly turned stiff and tense.
