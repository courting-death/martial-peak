## Chapter 157 — Small Matters Listen to You, Big Matters Listen to Me

Another three days of monotonous and tedious cultivation passed.

Yang Kai had actually completed his tempering two days prior. Half of the power of heaven and earth was used to temper his flesh and bones, making his body stronger and capable of withstanding the current realm's Primordial Qi impact. The other half was absorbed by his Proud Bone Golden Body, similar to the last time.

However, Su Yan was still refining the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew. Yang Kai did not dare to move recklessly and could only endure the discomfort in his heart while maintaining this awkward position.

Three days later, with the fluttering of her eyelashes, Su Yan opened her eyes, filled with joy and excitement.

Yang Kai's spirit jolted, and his breathing became slightly heavy.

He had been thirsting for this moment for days, and the anticipation had worn him down.

Their gazes met, and Su Yan said, “Thank you!”

When she opened her eyes, she knew that her body had undergone earth-shattering changes. With the refining of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, not only had she compensated for the loss incurred while helping Yang Kai, but her internal true essence had also become much purer. Coupled with the results of their previous dual cultivation, although her realm had not changed, her actual strength had increased by at least thirty percent. True essence flowed through her limbs and bones, operating continuously without the need for conscious effort. Every cell in her body bathed in that true essence, bursting with unprecedented vitality.

A holy radiance enveloped her face, making her look like a fairy descending from the heavens.

With this dual cultivation and the refining of the Jiuyin Condensing Primordial Dew, the slight traces left by twenty years of time on her body were completely smoothed out. Every inch of her skin became as fresh as that of a newborn, snow-white, crystal-clear, and delicate as jade.

“Do we still need to thank each other?” Yang Kai was slightly dazed. The previous Su Yan had given him a cold and noble feeling, but the current Su Yan made him involuntarily feel somewhat ashamed. This feeling would not disappear simply because they were close.

Su Yan smiled knowingly. This kind of mutual understanding felt warm. It seemed they needed no words to sense each other's thoughts.

“By the way, you just broke through to the Qi Movement Realm; this realm is quite special…” Su Yan adjusted her expression.

Before she could finish, Yang Kai interrupted her, his expression strange. “Don’t you think it’s a bit… inappropriate for us to discuss the issues of the Qi Movement Realm in this situation?”

Su Yan was taken aback and immediately blushed.

Yang Kai looked at her and smiled slightly. After being stiff for many days, his body instinctively moved. Su Yan let out a suppressed moan that was both enchanting and soul-stirring.

In that instant, she felt as if she had been thrown into the clouds, yet before she could steady herself, she plummeted fiercely into an abyss.

This unprecedented rise and fall brought an intoxicating joy that left her utterly unable to contain herself.

The young couple, having never experienced such matters, were already extraordinarily sensitive. Even the slightest movement could elicit an overwhelming stimulation.

Provoked by her gasps, Yang Kai's actions became even more unrestrained. His large hands roamed and kneaded her ample chest, burying his head deeper into her proud peaks. Heavy breaths echoed as he tenderly yet violently kissed Su Yan's skin.

Su Yan's long hair spilled out, cascading down to her perky backside. She tightly embraced Yang Kai's head, pressing it against her bosom, her long, straight legs wrapping around his waist unconsciously. With a clumsy and stiff movement, she twisted her body, responding to the waves of unbearable pleasure.

After a long while, Su Yan suddenly gripped Yang Kai's hair tightly, struggling to say, “Wait… wait…”

“What’s wrong?” Yang Kai raised his head to look at her, his fierce movements gradually calming down.

Su Yan could hardly speak. After catching her breath, her skin flushed a rosy hue. Her eyes sparkled with springtime emotions as she curiously asked, “Did I just… call out?”

“No!” Yang Kai quickly shook his head, his expression serious.

“Really not?” Su Yan confirmed uneasily, as her previous state had left her disoriented, unsure if she had made any sounds.

“Really not!” Yang Kai looked at her with utmost sincerity.

“You're lying to me!” Su Yan caught a glimpse of a hint of cunning and pride in Yang Kai's eyes. Just as she felt aggrieved, Yang Kai made a move that sent her mind spiraling into confusion once again.

Yang Kai wrapped his arms around Su Yan, lifting her up and turning around, presenting her back to him.

He intended to help Su Yan change out of that uncomfortable position, but upon seeing her back, his expression suddenly became fervent, and his eyes turned crimson.

Previously, on that night in Su Yan's small attic, although Yang Kai had seen her hazy silhouette, she had been wearing undergarments, and the lighting was dim, preventing him from seeing clearly.

But this time, so close, every inch of skin on Su Yan's body was laid bare to Yang Kai's gaze.

This was a back that could captivate the heavens!

The soft and graceful curve flowed down from her delicate shoulders, first dramatically inward at her waist and abdomen, then forming a breathtakingly perky shape. The transitions were so natural that any man who beheld this sight would go mad.

Not only that, at this moment, on Su Yan's smooth and white back, as her skin trembled and flushed, a vividly lifelike Ice Phoenix roamed about, occasionally perching on her shoulder or landing on her perky backside, as if it were alive.

This was the Ice Phoenix that had previously vanished!

With a slight sensation, Yang Kai felt a warmth on his own back.

They were indeed still there! Just transformed into this special tattoo.

After pausing for a moment, Yang Kai moved again.

In the muddy Peach Blossom Spring, a damp atmosphere filled the hall, and the sounds of their bodies intertwining mixed with Su Yan's soft gasps, creating a melody that sparked endless imagination.

The two gave freely and took freely, like fish in water, indistinguishable from one another…

In the hall, the chaotic atmosphere seemed not yet to have dissipated, while Yang Kai and Su Yan were already dressed neatly.

Before them was an ice mirror refined by Su Yan using her true essence, reflecting their figures. Su Yan sat sideways in front of the mirror, quietly gazing at herself.

The girl in the mirror, having just tasted passion, still bore a charming blush on her originally cool face.

Yang Kai stood behind her, helping her tidy her disheveled hair.

Silent, yet very warm.

From girl to woman, Su Yan's appearance seemed to add a touch of cold elegance. The icy chill in her beautiful eyes was stronger than ever, but only when looking at Yang Kai did that chill melt into tenderness.

Taking a hairpin that Su Yan handed him, Yang Kai inserted it into her hair.

Unlike her previous youthful style, Su Yan had this time gathered all her hair back, revealing her smooth neck, a hairstyle typical of women.

“Looks good!” Yang Kai praised.

“Do you like it?”

“Mm.” As Yang Kai answered, he reached out his hands to rest on Su Yan's shoulders.

Although they had already shared intimate moments, he still felt a faint sense of nervousness when facing Su Yan. This was a feeling brought by the previous Su Yan, and it would likely not dissipate in a short time.

After testing for a while, and seeing that Su Yan did not move, Yang Kai slowly let his hands slide down.

In the mirror, a teasing smile appeared on Su Yan's lips. Just as Yang Kai's hand was about to reach its peak, she grasped it.

“Su Yan…” Yang Kai leaned down, pressing his lips against her earlobe.

He discovered that this spot on Su Yan was very sensitive, a forbidden area that should not be touched.

“Don’t!” Su Yan panicked and dodged. She knew that once Yang Kai kissed her there, she would surely lose all power to resist. She hurriedly said, “Let’s talk about serious matters first.”

“Serious matters? Alright!” Yang Kai reined in his frivolous demeanor and sat down beside her.

Su Yan gently caressed the face of the man who had taken her body. Her gaze was somewhat dazed as she looked at him for a long while before asking, “How old are you this year?”

Yang Kai sniffed, “Twenty!”

His expression was somewhat unnatural, his gaze flickering. After finishing, he added, “I’m not lying!”

Su Yan looked at him with a faint smile, saying nothing.

Yang Kai felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles, feeling uncomfortable all over. After a long while, he reluctantly murmured, “Fifteen… almost sixteen.”

“I’m twenty! Older than you. From now on, you have to listen to me.”

“Small matters listen to you, big matters listen to me.” Yang Kai grinned.

Su Yan sighed, her expression filled with affection and tolerance. Her delicate hand, as smooth as jade, rested on Yang Kai's face. “You’re too young; experiencing this too early is not good for you.”

“Age is not a problem.” Yang Kai raised his eyes to look at her, his brows twitching. With a meaningful expression, he said, “You’ve experienced it too.”

Su Yan's face flushed, and she glared at him reproachfully, “You’re not allowed to tease me like that!”

“I didn’t!” Yang Kai said helplessly, “You’re overthinking it.”

“From now on, you’re not allowed to always think about that kind of thing.”

Yang Kai immediately drooped his head, as if his soul had left him.

Seeing him like this, Su Yan's icy heart softened immediately. In a whisper, she said, “If you promise me not to think wildly, and that it won’t interfere with your cultivation, then I will… come find you once a month…”

“Can it be five times?” Yang Kai began to haggle.

Su Yan pretended to look coldly at him, saying nothing.

“Then four times… three times… Alright, alright, two times should be fine, right?”

“Fine, once is once!” Yang Kai agreed verbally, but in his heart, he thought that it wouldn’t be up to her then. Once he touched that exquisite earlobe of hers, wouldn’t she be like a lamb to the slaughter?

“It’s not that I want to bind you. I know the benefits of dual cultivation for both of us. But your body is too weak. Wait until you grow a bit more, a few years from now, and I won’t make such demands on you anymore.” Su Yan's voice was soft and gentle, “Just endure for these few years, alright?”

Her serious tone felt like a request.

“Mm.” Yang Kai nodded heavily. He also knew that Su Yan was doing this for his own good. These years in Lingxiao Pavilion had been quite tough, leading to his somewhat thin physique, which might have caused Su Yan to misunderstand.

“And you just broke through to the Qi Movement Realm…”

“I know about this.” Yang Kai interrupted her, not letting her continue.

Su Yan looked at him and nodded, “As long as you know. This realm is quite special; it is the same for every martial artist. You must treat it with caution.”

While speaking, Su Yan fumbled at her neck and, after a moment, took off a jade pendant there, placing it around Yang Kai's neck.
