## Chapter 1894 — Return to Shuiyue Star

A blinding radiance burst forth, and everyone standing nearby could not keep their eyes open.

When the light subsided and they looked around, the center of the formation was empty; Yang Kai and the others had long since vanished without a trace.

Dark Star, Lingxiao Sect, on the plaza.

The Space Array flickered with light, and four figures appeared simultaneously.

Yang Kai stood calmly in the center, a faint smile on his face as he looked at Ba He and the others.

Such ultra-long-distance teleportation always brought some physical discomfort to the travelers; the lower one’s cultivation, the more pronounced the effect.

Aside from Yang Kai, among the other three Ba He had the highest cultivation at the First Stage of the Void King Realm, so he recovered first; within roughly five breaths his eyes cleared.

Another ten breaths later, Shen Tu and Yu Xiong gradually came around.

All three of them wore expressions of lingering dread.

The sensation brought on by that ultra-long-distance teleportation made one feel as if falling into an abyss without end, utterly powerless — those who had tried it once definitely would not willingly try a second time.

“Is this the Dark Star you were talking about?” Ba He looked around and unfurled his Divine Sense. He soon wore an astonished expression — this was actually a prime treasure land: clear mountains and clean waters, an auspicious land that nurtured heroes; distant ridges rolled on, mists steamed up, and the Spiritual Qi here was exceptionally dense.

"Lingxiao Sect!" Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Suddenly, a Divine Sense belonging to an expert of the Void King Realm swept from a distant peak — the strength of that Divine Sense could only belong to an expert at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm.

Ba He and the others' faces changed slightly.

That was not all; after that Divine Sense swept past, another Divine Sense spread out the next moment. Although the second was weaker than the first, it was still the kind of Divine Sense a First Stage of the Void King Realm expert could possess.

The first Divine Sense quickly withdrew.

Yang Kai knew it was the Ghost Ancestor sensing the commotion here, so he had sent out a Divine Sense to probe; upon discovering them he did not meddle further.

After all, he was currently in seclusion and should not be easily distracted.

The second Divine Sense soon faded as well — it belonged to Ye Xijun.

"Your Lingxiao Sect — besides you, there is actually a Second Stage of the Void King Realm expert, and a First Stage of the Void King Realm expert?" Ba He asked in astonishment.

"Yes." Yang Kai nodded, his gaze turning to a not-far-off spot where Ye Xijun flashed into view, rushing toward them.

Ba He breathed a sigh of relief, his face full of astonishment.

He had never expected that this obscure Lingxiao Sect, which he had never heard of, would possess such powerful foundations!

Two Second Stage of the Void King Realm experts and one First Stage of the Void King Realm — though not a large number, such a lineup placed them in the upper-middle tier of the Star Domain.

Moreover, they had many Origin Returning Realm experts and controlled this treasure land; given time, this Lingxiao Sect might not be inferior to the Star Domain’s three great powers.

Ba He looked at Yang Kai as if he saw limitless possibilities for the future in him.

A graceful figure appeared and, after glancing at Ba He and the others, addressed Yang Kai: "Sect Master, you have returned!"

"Great Elder, I hope you have have been well!" Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Ye Xijun said, "Thanks to the Sect Master’s blessing, I am well and the sect is well; these are..."

"This is Ba He from the Red Moon Domain on Di Chen Star, this is Yu Xiong, and this is Shen Tu, the second young master of the Hengluo Commerce Guild — they are my friends," Yang Kai introduced them, then introduced Ye Xijun to them.

The two sides exchanged polite greetings.

Ye Xijun asked, "Sect Master, how long will you stay at the sect this time?"

"I’ll leave soon; I only brought them to test the formation."

Ye Xijun nodded lightly. "Sect Master, you must take care of yourself while busy outside."

"I will; you attend to your affairs."

Ye Xijun nodded and vanished in a flash.

While Ba He and the others were surveying the surroundings, Yang Kai extended his Divine Sense to check on his family; after a short moment a pleased expression crossed his face as he said, "The formation test is complete; let us return."

Shen Tu’s face changed. "Yang Kai, since we’re already on your turf, can you not at least play host? You should stay a few days before leaving."

Yu Xiong vigorously nodded beside him.

Even Ba He looked at Yang Kai with eager expectation.

The three of them had not yet fully recovered from that ultra-long-distance teleportation.

"Perhaps another time." Yang Kai grinned, then without further ado activated the Great Space Array beneath his feet; a white light enveloped them, Spatial Force roared, and their figures vanished.

Yu Xiong and Shen Tu's piteous howls were cut off abruptly.

When they recovered their senses, they were back at Half Moon Mountain.

Li Nuo, Chun Yi and the others saw Shen Tu’s ashen face and hurried over, anxiously fussing over him as if they had not met for decades.

Ba He shook his head with a bitter smile. "Your formation is indeed impressive... but that teleportation feeling is really..."

"Ha! Convenience always comes at a price," Yang Kai laughed heartily.

It was unavoidable; unless someone cultivated Spatial Force like him, they would all experience some discomfort during teleportation, though it would not cause lasting harm.

"True enough!" Ba He agreed after thinking it over, concurring with Yang Kai.

"Our business here is concluded; we’ll take our leave. Ba He, please hand this Spatial Ring to Biluo — inside are some Spiritual Pills I refined for her and Qingluo."

Ba He took it, swept his Divine Sense inside, and his face changed slightly. "This is... quite lavish!"

Now that he was a First Stage of the Void King Realm, Ba He held high status in the Red Moon Domain and received considerable privileges, yet he was still dazzled by the pills in the ring.

Especially since some of them were Void King-Grade Spiritual Pills; even he felt his heart quicken at the sight.

"Just a few pills; don’t let it embarrass you."

"Are you not afraid I’ll misappropriate them?" Ba He asked meaningfully.

Yang Kai smiled, "If I did not trust you even that much, I would not ask you to deliver them."

Ba He nodded solemnly. "Rest assured, I will safely deliver these things to that girl Biluo."

Yang Kai thanked him again and, with Shen Tu and the others, headed toward the warship’s mooring.

Ba He and Yu Xiong escorted them along the way.

After a short while the warship hummed, rose slowly, pierced the sky, and darted into the clouds.

……

Traveling from the Yao Star Di Chen to the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s main star would take at least half a year; any delays along the way would only extend that time.

So once the warship was underway, Yang Kai entered seclusion.

In the earlier battle with the two yao lords he had not relied on any external aid; he had used only the methods at his disposal and had not even employed Spatial Force, yet he had still pressed the two lords down hard.

After that fight Yang Kai had a clear understanding of his limits.

Though he was only at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm now, at that level there was essentially no one who could match him; with all his methods unleashed, even two or three opponents would not trouble him.

Against a Third Stage of the Void King Realm expert he needed to be more cautious, but with Spatial Force at his disposal he could stand undefeated.

In the fight with the two yao lords he had deployed the Dragon Scale he had earlier refined to block the Blood Jiao’s killing blow, even damaging its Inner Core, which testified to the scale’s toughness and strength.

However, that had merely been the simplest usage; the Dragon Scale’s true dragon capabilities had not been fully unleashed.

The True Dragon Scale was impervious to all, and only a Divine Spirit of equal rank could harm it. If Yang Kai could trigger the True Dragon power within the scale, he would possess an unbreakable defense and could attack without concern for defense.

Thus Yang Kai continually nourished the Dragon Scale within his body with his Golden Blood and Divine Sense, hoping to bring forth its true power; he also constantly refined the Dragon Bone sword to prepare for later refining of the Dragon Spine Bone and the Dragon Pearl, two true dragon secret treasures.

He remained in the Small Xuan Realm, ears deaf to outside affairs, wholly devoted to secluded cultivation, and time flew by.

His journey had been fairly lucky; there had been no major incidents, only several Starry Sky storms and meteor streams.

The Hengluo Commerce Guild’s warship was an Upper-Level Origin-Grade vessel, easily withstanding the Starry Sky storms and dodging meteor streams; the voyage was smooth.

One day Yang Kai suddenly sensed a knock at his door.

He stepped out from the Xuan Realm Pearl, put away the Imperial Treasure, and opened the door.

Outside stood Hua Youmeng. Upon seeing Yang Kai she took a step back and respectfully said, "Sir, Young Master Shen Tu sent me to inform you that Shuiyue Star is arriving soon."

"So soon!" Yang Kai was astonished; he felt as though he had only been in seclusion a short while, yet they were already nearing their destination.

Hua Youmeng pursed her lips and smiled. "It has been seven months since you entered seclusion..."

Yang Kai nodded and smiled. "In that case, let us go together."

"Yes!" Hua Youmeng obediently inclined her head and followed closely behind Yang Kai.

After walking for a while, Yang Kai suddenly turned and asked, "By the way, Shen Tu said last time that he would have your Five Directions Commerce Guild take up residence in his territory and serve as the guild steward there — has he mentioned it again?"

Hearing this, Hua Youmeng felt warmth in her heart and gratefully said, "Young Master Shen Tu did say so; he promised that once we arrived he would arrange it immediately."

"And you agreed to it?"

"Yes, this is an opportunity for our guilds."

"Then congratulations, President Hua; I wish you and your Commerce Guild abundant fortune."

"Thank you for your kind words, Sir," Hua Youmeng murmured, though a trace of melancholy flickered across her beautiful eyes.

In the past she would have been joyful over such news, but after everything that had transpired she could not explain why, when she thought of her future, she felt a faint sense of loss alongside the happiness.

Gazing at his retreating silhouette, Hua Youmeng understood he would walk ever farther away — from that moment on, their paths would never cross again.

Her nose stung and she nearly burst into tears.
