## Chapter 1227 — Plundering

Other disciples of the Medicine Pill Sect, the moment Li Younan moved, simultaneously produced their defensive Secret Treasures to guard their bodies; it was clear they'd arranged this beforehand, otherwise their actions wouldn't be so uniform.

The Medicine Pill Sect's strange maneuver stunned every martial artist who saw it; no one knew why they took up the posture of facing a great enemy.

Though they didn't understand the reason, everyone sensed danger—Li Younan had plainly withheld something, and more peril would likely follow; otherwise they wouldn't be behaving like this.

Without anyone having to remind them, all the martial artists who saw Li Younan and the others imitated them and produced their own defensive Secret Treasures.

Over at Yingyue Hall's side, Wei Guchang gave a cold snort. Rushing Saint Yuan burst forth from his body and a pitch-black light curtain wrapped the little hillock; inside that curtain, crimson thunder and fire flickered.

Dong Xuan'er produced a token-like object and poured Saint Yuan into it; the token instantly transformed into a streak of light that danced at the sides of the onlookers.

Daiyuan continued to wield the secret treasure called the Rainbow Handkerchief; a cloudlike pink aura likewise enveloped the hillock.

The only one who made no move was Yang Kai—he still seemed immersed in his own comprehension. He needed no action; having Wei Guchang and the others guarding him was sufficient.

The disciple from the Star Emperor Sect didn't enjoy such company. He had always been alone, monopolizing a hillock; upon noticing the odd behavior of the crowd he opened his eyes and coldly watched the red sun in the sky.

At that moment, myriad red beams erupted as if exploding outward. From the red sun they shot forth, sweeping in all directions.

Those red beams carried tremendous force and moved with terrifying speed; in the blink of an eye they reached everyone, shaking the protections the martial artists had produced, while the clanging sounds rang without end.

Only then did everyone understand why the Medicine Pill Sect disciples had taken up protection in advance.

The cold-faced martial artist of the Star Emperor Sect, seeing this, grew solemn and threw a punch. That blow seemed to stir certain laws between heaven and earth—where the punch wind passed, every red beam was swallowed and vanished.

Wei Guchang and the others who had been watching him turned pale.

Such a punch appeared calm and effortless, yet anyone could see the man's overwhelming might.

The myriad red beams arrived and departed in an instant; because everyone was prepared, they disappeared as quickly as they came. Aside from a few who were caught unready and injured, everyone else remained unharmed.

Li Younan couldn't help showing a trace of disappointment—he knew his earlier action had been too conspicuous, which had alerted everyone; if not for that, far more would have been injured.

But he soon forced a wry smile. All the martial artists now glared at him angrily, clearly blaming him for not being clear, accusing him of scheming to take advantage of the situation—his motives were suspect.

Li Younan didn't bother to argue. The strange phenomena before the Red Candle Fruit's maturity were not his obligation to reveal to others; exposing the Three Suns Rising spectacle served his own interest, so withholding some information was perfectly normal.

He believed no one would be foolish enough to scold him over such a trifling matter.

Indeed, everyone only shot him a glance and said nothing more. In truth, no one had time to bicker, for after the red beams fired forth the lone red sun in the sky suddenly began to plummet rapidly toward the valley.

In just a dozen breaths the red sun fell into a spot in the valley, flashing and disappearing without a trace.

"Prepare!" Daiyuan suddenly called in a low voice. She pointed, and the pink mist folded back into the Rainbow Handkerchief and was taken into her hand; her lovely eyes were fixed intently on the area below the valley.

"Should we wake Senior Brother Yang?" Dong Xuan'er bit her lip and looked at Yang Kai with some hesitation.

Yang Kai's Saint Yuan had been roiling without cease. Earlier they had refrained from disturbing him for fear of interrupting his comprehension, but now the Red Candle Fruit was about to surface and Dong Xuan'er did not know whether to warn him so he wouldn't miss such a spectacle.

Wei Guchang slightly frowned and shook his head. "No need. Brother Yang certainly knows what's happening out there. If he intends to join the scramble, he'll make a move. We'd better not disturb him."

Dong Xuan'er nodded lightly.

No sooner had Wei Guchang spoken than a cracking noise came from below the valley, as if the earth itself were splitting. Everyone staggered as the little hillock they stood on shed chunks of soil and slid.

Thick, intense crimson energy surged from the fissures in the valley floor and instantly filled the entire valley, obscuring whatever lay within.

Yet faintly, at the place where the red sun had fallen, something was slowly rising, emitting a deep scarlet glow.

That glow looked like the flame of a candle in wind and rain—liable to be snuffed out at any moment—yet however the elements buffeted it, it wavered but stood firm.

After a while, under everyone's close scrutiny, that candle-like light finally floated to the surface.

It was a fist-sized scarlet spirit fruit. Its skin was thin and tender, irresistibly appetizing, oddly shaped like a lit candle. Its surface was crystal-clear, and inside one could faintly see strands of pure energy writhing like little serpents.

"Red Candle Fruit!" Li Younan could no longer contain himself and shouted.

No sooner had his voice fallen than a ribbon-like Secret Treasure flew from some hillock and swept in. The ribbon was astonishingly lively, like a woman's arm, extending ten-odd zhang; it lashed over the Red Candle Fruit as if to wrap the miraculous fruit within.

Yin Sudie made her move! Having waited for days until the spirit fruit ripened and emerged, she could no longer hold back, so she acted first.

Almost at the same time, a bolt of lightning arced in from the side with a crisp crack and struck the ribbon, knocking it slightly aside so that it swept empty.

Yin Sudie let out a small cry, bit her lip, cast a resentful, frustrated glare at Fang Tianzhong, stamped her foot and cried, "Senior Brother Fang!"

Fang Tianzhong's expression remained cold. Lightning danced between his hands as he waved them, sending bolt after bolt downward to intercept and block every technique aimed at seizing the Red Candle Fruit, paying no heed to Yin Sudie's coquettish grievance.

The Liuli Gate beauty's face flickered with annoyance; her heart secretly burned with resentment, and she could not afford to bicker further with Fang Tianzhong—she instead drove her ribbon-like Secret Treasure and joined the scramble.

From a dozen hilltops dozens of martial artists struck in an instant; their single target was the now-mature Red Candle Fruit. At this moment the budding talents of Dark Star nearly all unleashed their signature techniques.

Martial techniques and Secret Treasures flared so brilliantly they lit half the sky like daylight; the contest in the valley became fierce and chaotic.

Yet no one dared be reckless; every hand moved with care so as not to damage the Red Candle Fruit even a hair's breadth, and they strove to keep the fighting at least one zhang away from it.

One side sought to prevent others from seizing the fruit while the other strained to snatch it for themselves. Warriors from each force seemed almost to have coordinated in advance, dividing into two teams and cooperating.

Smaller forces inevitably suffered the most; Yingyue Hall was in just that predicament.

Daiyuan had come with Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er, but she acted alone—she had no intention of combining efforts with Wei Guchang. Everyone knew such a heaven-defying spirit fruit could not be claimed by an individual; even if one managed to seize it, it must be surrendered to the Sect, which would determine its fate.

Daiyuan and Dong Xuan'er were close friends, but when the Sect's interests were at stake they dared not overstep; refraining from becoming enemies was the most they could allow.

Once Daiyuan was set aside, Yingyue Hall was left with only Wei Guchang and Dong Xuan'er—one to block, one to grab—and they were stretched rather thin.

By contrast, the cold man from the Star Emperor Sect struck with each blow like a thunderclap, his every action awe-inspiring, which drew much of the crowd's attention to him.

That fellow had likely left Star Emperor Mountain for the first time to gain experience and did not understand the perils of standing out; soon he frowned, for whenever he struck the air, at least a dozen attacks would come to intercept him—an attention the others did not receive.

It seemed an unspoken consensus had formed: he must be restrained, while the others proceeded with their own methods.

This multiplied the pressure on the Star Emperor Sect's cold warrior. No matter how startling his power, he could not contend with so many elites and found himself in an embarrassingly difficult position.

In a fury he coldly snorted and stamped his feet hard on the ground. The force seemed to make the earth tremble, and an astonishing wave of energy surged from his body.

The dozen or so warriors from the remaining forces watching there were all shocked as they looked his way. They saw him slowly swing out a fist, and yet from before that fist a huge, visible column of energy explosively shot forth!

"Bad—stop him! He's gone mad!" Li Younan cried out in terror once more; sweat drenched his clothes and his face turned pale.

That fist was aimed straight at the Red Candle Fruit. If such an attack struck the fruit, the heaven-defying spirit fruit would be smashed to powder and vanish.

How could Li Younan remain calm? He launched a fierce assault to intercept that enormous energy column.

The others needed no further urging and struck in to assist.

Boom—boom—boom… thunderous sounds rang out as the giant energy column was met and blunted by blow after blow. Astonishingly, the column did not dissipate, and it still thundered toward the front of the Red Candle Fruit.
