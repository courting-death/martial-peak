## Chapter 1490 — The Final Push

The Spatial Force he had cultivated could be used in a situation like this; if he tore open space at the right moment he might be able to escape unscathed, so compared to the other four, Yang Kai was the calmest.

However, there was great risk: if the ripped space encountered an energy shock too strong, it could become unstable or even seal. Shuttling through an unstable space rift, even he could not guarantee his safety.

He would not do so unless absolutely necessary.

All five were trapped in dire straits with no way out, forced to stand their ground and wait for death; this despair settled over everyone, throwing them into panic.

At that moment, the elder surnamed Chen suddenly cried out, as if some new anomaly had occurred.

With his cry, the energy in front of them—woven from the Five Elements—quickened its flow in an instant; the cave entrance in the cliff became incredibly clear, as if it had stabilized and was passable.

The Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation seemed about to break!

The discovery filled everyone with the thrilling hope of salvation, but the next moment they all cried out in alarm.

With the rotation of the energies in the void, an enormous, unbelievable suction swept from before them; the remaining power in the four people's bodies poured out like a breached dam, completely uncontrollable.

Visible to the naked eye, their auras wilted; one by one they grew as pale as paper, staggering. Even Yang Kai was affected—at that instant he felt much of his Saint Yuan vanish from his body.

The amount was almost equivalent to the entire strength of a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm martial artist.

He had a vast reserve of Saint Yuan and needn't fear for his life, but the four, including the elder surnamed Jiang, were different—the Saint Yuan left in their bodies was instantly sucked dry, and even their Qi and blood were stripped away.

All four rolled their eyes; they inhaled more than they exhaled. Rivulets of crimson energy were drawn from their bodies like writhing blood-serpents—full of spirit—and merged into the void before them.

That was their lifeforce—the very foundation of their survival!

Visible to the eye, their bodies withered at a terrifying speed; their eye sockets sank deep, facial skin dried like bark, as if centuries passed over them in an instant. Even their hair went white—swiftly silvered like snow.

Silent and soundless—within merely ten breaths’ time, four Second-Stage Origin Returning Realm experts had lost the right to live, their auras completely extinguished.

At that moment, the Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation seemed to have reached its saturation point, transforming into a massive surge of energy that began battering against the entrance of the cave mansion.

But without the aid of the other four, Yang Kai alone could not possibly maintain the balance of the Five Elements.

If the balance broke, given the nature of the Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation, it would inevitably rebound all the energy outward.

That energy contained the enormous lifeforce and Saint Yuan of four Second Stage experts; even Yang Kai could not guarantee to survive such a rebound—at best he would be grievously wounded.

The most likely outcome would be instant death!

Would all efforts be ruined at the final step? Reluctance flashed in Yang Kai's eyes—five of them had come seeking treasure together, and the others had died before him. Though they were merely chance acquaintances with no deep bonds, if it all failed now their deaths would have been utterly meaningless.

Yang Kai did not feel sorrow for them in the sentimental sense—cultivators live this way, ever shadowed by peril, where death could strike in an unguarded moment—but he was unwilling to give up so easily.

But alone, he simply couldn't keep the Five Elements in balance.

Was his only option really to tear open space and flee at once?

As that thought flashed, Yang Kai had already gathered Spatial Force, ready to rend space. But the next moment his eyes brightened as if he'd remembered something; he instantly suppressed the Spatial Force and, with a single flip of his hand, conjured a five-colored orb in his palm.

Undying Five Elements Sword Qi!

The Undying Five Elements Sword is a Body-Tempering Cultivation Method, but its requirements are extremely harsh: it demands not only physical strength but also a powerful Divine Sense to endure the pain of cultivation, and one must seek the Five Elements supreme treasures to draw the Spiritual Qi needed to practice.

Yang Kai had spent considerable thought and time, deliberately and by chance finally assembling the Five Elements supreme treasures, and had cultivated the method for a period.

The mass of Undying Five Elements Sword Qi in his hand was the fruit of that cultivation, but his practice time was short and the Sword Qi's power was weak—unsuitable for facing a strong enemy.

But it might help in the present situation.

Sun's True Essence, Profound Yin Moon Water, Thundertree, Profound Crystal, Dayan Divine Sand—each is an object that defies heaven; none could be found on Dark Star. Even the Five Elements Sword Qi refined from these materials, however weak, would not be insignificant.

Moreover, it was Yang Kai's alone; he could wield it at will, more deft and balanced than cooperating with others to channel Saint Yuan.

Especially now—the Five Elements Calamity Spirit Formation was nearly broken, missing only that final push.

Perhaps the Undying Five Elements Sword Qi could be the last straw to break the camel's back!

Thinking this, Yang Kai immediately swung out; the five-colored orb in his hand split into five, forming five exquisite small swords that shot into the void from where the five had stood, fusing into that dreadful energy.

Having done this, Yang Kai did not linger but tore open space and dove headfirst into the spatial rift.

A tremendous boom and a massive shockwave seemed to come from behind.

The spatial rift was destroyed in an instant, and Yang Kai found himself fifty li away, pale, looking back with lingering dread.

He hadn't fled far—after all he'd done what he could and left the rest to fate; he wasn't sure whether it had succeeded.

A searing pain burned his back; though he had run fast, the shock grazed his back at the last moment. Scanned by his Divine Sense, his back was a mass of torn flesh—the wound deep enough to expose bone.

Such an injury was not light, but Yang Kai's physique was extraordinary and he had Golden Blood, so recovery should not be difficult.

With a slight circulation of Saint Yuan to stem the bleeding, Yang Kai shot off toward the place fifty li away.

The commotion just now had been enormous — if anyone was nearby, it was very likely to draw their attention. Yang Kai had no intention of exhausting his efforts only to have others swoop in and seize the prize.

The fifty li were covered in an instant and he returned to the original spot. Yang Kai scanned the area and couldn't help but raise an eyebrow in pleasure.

He had actually succeeded.

Though the cliff face was a mess, bearing traces of the energy's ravaging, and the bodies of the elder Jiang and the others were gone, there was a cave entrance in the cliff leading inward.

An ancient martial artist's dwelling!

Yang Kai did not hesitate; he flickered and slipped inside.

He did not relax his guard; his Divine Sense probed the surroundings. The ancient martial artist's dwelling seemed not to hold much danger, and he moved deeper inside unimpeded.

Soon, a string of exquisite stone chambers appeared before Yang Kai—about a dozen or so.

Without hesitation, Yang Kai began searching from the leftmost chamber.

After a moment he left that chamber and rushed into the second, then immediately the third.

After searching the dozen or so rooms, his gains were meager—aside from a few bottles of Pills whose efficacy had long faded, there was nothing else.

Would he return empty-handed? Yang Kai felt a little dejected—if so, then the deaths of elder Jiang and the others would be for nothing, and his hopes wasted.

That was possible; not every ancient martial artist's dwelling contained treasures—perhaps others had already beaten him to it, or it had been empty to begin with.

Only the last chamber remained; Yang Kai sniffed and stepped inside.

The next moment his eyes brightened and he darted to a stone table, grinning broadly.

On the table lay two items. One was a Secret Treasure—a short arrow of odd make; the arrow was inlaid with two milky-white jade stones he could not identify, one at the head and one at the tail, giving it a peculiar look.

The Secret Treasure did not exude strong energy fluctuations. Yang Kai picked it up and frowned—he could not immediately determine its grade.

In theory, the entrance's seals had been so strong the owner must have had considerable cultivation in life—how could such an odd Secret Treasure be here?

Before he could examine it thoroughly, Yang Kai suddenly looked up toward a direction, and his face darkened.

Although he'd suspected that such a huge disturbance would attract nearby cultivators, he had not expected them to arrive so quickly.

Two hundred li away, the aura of cultivators had already breached—judging from their flight it was heading straight for this place.

Realizing this, Yang Kai wasted no time. He stuffed the short arrow into his Spatial Ring, snatched up a jade box from the table, and hurried away.

In about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, a trio appeared before the ancient dwelling—three Origin Returning Realm cultivators. Judging by their dress, they seemed from the same sect. Seeing the entrance, their eyes lit up and they flew in.

But after checking inside, the three could not help but show disappointment.

The place had only two items—a short arrow and a jade box—and with Yang Kai having taken them, there was nothing left for them to gain.

Still, the three were not entirely disheartened and continued searching the chambers, but ultimately found nothing.

By then, Yang Kai was already a thousand li away.

In terms of speed he was no slower than any Origin Returning Realm cultivator, and after activating his Wind-and-Thunder Wings his speed gained a massive boost.

One day in a natural cave, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his vast Divine Sense extending outward; after confirming there was no one within a thousand li, he took out his earlier spoils to see what they were.
