## Chapter 825 — If You Don’t Leave Now, You Won’t Be Able To

A hundred Li outside the Nine Peaks.

In a dense forest, many cultivators hid themselves, not daring to breathe. Sunlight slanted through the leaves, casting mottled light and shadow over Zhang Ao and the others, their faces shifting between bright and dark.

It had been ten full days since they were routed by the yao and barely escaped with their lives.

In these ten days, every time Zhang Ao recalled that scene, he burned with unwillingness. He had thought he could capture that brat as he wished and force out the secret of Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s inheritance, only for the yao to interfere at the crucial moment.

The Great Yao Lord had brought dozens of experts and beaten them into a panicked retreat.

By now, the forces gathered around Zhang Ao had long since scattered to nothing. Only Poxuan Palace, War Soul Hall, and Netherworld Sect remained.

With that much strength, they couldn’t even gnaw through the former Nine Heavens Sacred Land, much less talk of taking revenge on the yao.

And the three of them had suffered heavy losses; they had few top experts left.

Withdrawing at this point was undoubtedly the best choice, but Zhang Ao still couldn’t swallow the indignation. After rallying so many forces, he had still failed to do anything to Nine Heavens Sacred Land. He could already picture the news spreading—his Poxuan Palace becoming the laughingstock of the world.

His Qi and blood churned, and Zhang Ao’s expression grew ever more vicious.

“That despicable brat dared collude with yao fiends—infuriating!” Zhang Ao growled under his breath, eyes blood‑red as he stared toward Nine Heavens Sacred Land, unwilling yet helpless.

Cao Guan wore the same furious look and said lowly, “He dared flout the world’s condemnation. Once word spreads, I doubt he’ll be able to stand on the continent.”

Wu Jie chuckled. “Nine Heavens Sacred Land is interesting—joining hands with the yao. Truly unexpected.”

“It may not be Xu Hui’s idea. I’ve dealt with him for decades—I know his temperament. He wouldn’t do this. It’s likely that boy’s doing,” Zhang Ao snorted. “What matters now is how to seize him from the yao.”

“Indeed—that’s a tough nut,” Cao Guan said with a deep frown.

“You still haven’t given up?” Wu Jie looked at them in surprise and shook his head. “With the Great Yao Lord shielding him, what ability do you have to catch him?”

“Can he hide forever? Until I catch that brat, I won’t rest,” Zhang Ao said, face ferocious.

“I think so too. What’s this, Brother Wu—you took our benefits and now want to back out?” His eyes turned cold as he looked at Wu Jie.

Wu Jie quickly raised his hand. “Taking money to dispel calamity for others has always been my Netherworld Sect’s creed. Since I took your things, I’ll help you to the end.”

“All the better,” Zhang Ao said with satisfaction.

As the three spoke, a scout who had gone to reconnoiter the Nine Peaks hurried back. After a respectful bow, he reported, “The Nine Peaks have been occupied by the yao. Inside, I didn’t see a single disciple of Nine Heavens Sacred Land. Only traces of Demonic Beasts and yao experts moving about. They’re busy—it looks like they mean to mine that rich Crystal Stone vein.”

At that, Zhang Ao’s and Cao Guan’s faces twitched, hearts aching.

If not for the yao’s interference, that rich vein would be theirs now.

“You’re certain you didn’t see a single disciple of Nine Heavens Sacred Land?” Zhang Ao asked with a frown. This news nagged at him. Not seeing them during the battle could be explained as hiding—but now seeing none at all was curious.

“Yes. Your subordinate and several dozen others watched the periphery for a day and night. We truly didn’t find any disciples of Nine Heavens Sacred Land.”

“Thousands of disciples of Nine Heavens Sacred Land don’t just vanish,” Cao Guan said in puzzlement. He pondered. “Brother Zhang, could it be the yao have…”

Zhang Ao’s eyes lit with a wicked gleam, and he let out a strange laugh. “It’s possible. The yao aren’t easy to deal with. Maybe that brat tried to collude with them and got targeted instead—serves the clown right for hoisting himself with his own petard.”

“Serves him right!” Cao Guan brightened, his mood easing. “But if that’s so, if the brat is in the Great Yao Lord’s hands, how do we get him out?”

Zhang Ao frowned and fell into thought, but after racking his brains for a long time, he still came up with nothing. Silence fell.

...

In a vast palace hall, Yang Kai and the Great Yao Lord sat cross‑legged facing one another. Between them, exquisitely detailed spirit formation diagrams were being sketched.

Stifling his impatience, Yang Kai explained them to the Great Lord.

He had already engraved those few spirit formation diagrams related to the Huasheng Pool into fine jade, but after the Great Yao Lord examined them, he declared he couldn’t understand them and insisted Yang Kai explain them in person.

Fortunately, the fellow’s comprehension wasn’t bad. Though he’d never touched these before, after ten days of Yang Kai’s careful instruction, he could finally grasp the key points of those few diagrams.

All that remained was to let him slowly comprehend the rest. If problems arose with yao transformations in the future, he could guide and repair them himself, without needing Yang Kai’s hand.

When Yang Kai finished, the Great Yao Lord let out a slow breath. Shock flickered beneath his calm face as he murmured, “These spirit formation diagrams accord with the principles of Heaven and are greatly beneficial to martial cultivation. Who taught you these?”

“I can’t tell you that,” Yang Kai said with a chuckle.

“Very well. I don’t mean to pry into your secrets. It’s just that many subtleties and mysteries lie hidden in these diagrams—beyond what your current realm and insight can see. Though I’m not your equal in formations, I judge people better than you. Boy, cherish and study these spirit formation diagrams well. One day you’ll find there’s far more power in them than you imagine.”

Yang Kai knit his brows, lost in thought.

“I recall you said you’re an alchemist?” the Great Yao Lord suddenly asked.

“Mm,” Yang Kai nodded.

“Since you’re an alchemist, why not stay and refine pills for my clan? I think your alchemy should be good. Over the years we’ve gathered many rare materials—things you humans could never find.”

“I’ll pass.” Yang Kai rose to his feet. “I’m not interested.”

“Don’t be so hasty. Everything is negotiable. Name your terms—I can agree,” the Great Yao Lord said with a laugh.

Yang Kai slowly shook his head. “I appreciate the thought, Great Lord, but I have other matters to attend to. I won’t linger here. By the way, about that Reflecting Moon Pool I mentioned—you must keep a good watch on it. Someone will come to investigate in the future.”

“Leaving already?” The Great Lord frowned.

“If I don’t leave now, I’m afraid I won’t be able to,” Yang Kai said, meeting the Great Lord’s eyes without fear.

The Great Lord laughed. After a moment’s thought, he nodded. “Go, then. We’ll meet again.”

“Take care, Great Lord. It may be only a few years before I come to reclaim the Nine Peaks, so make good use of the resources here while you can.”

With that, without waiting for a reply, his figure blurred—and he vanished from the hall.

Only after Yang Kai left did the Great Lord’s expression turn grave. He let out a scoffing laugh. “A few years? The boy underestimates me.”

He had already made a grand move, leading his people from the Beast Sea Great Forest at the risk of enmity with the human race to help Yang Kai solve his crisis. How could he occupy the Nine Peaks for only a few years?

“Great Lord, you’re just letting him go?” Caidie appeared like a specter and frowned. “He holds the secret of the Huasheng Pool.”

“And he has done my yao a kindness,” the Great Lord said, his look complicated. “I know what worries you, but that boy can be trusted—he won’t easily leak the Huasheng Pool’s secret. My yao aren’t like humans. We won’t be ungrateful. Caidie, don’t entertain crooked thoughts. I know you want to keep him under house arrest. Put away that base idea.”

“Yes,” Caidie answered respectfully. She cast a faint glance toward where Yang Kai had vanished, then suddenly laughed. “But he is arrogant enough—first claiming he could catch up to the Great Lord in twenty or thirty years, and now saying he’ll take back the Nine Peaks in just a few years. I don’t know what he’s thinking.”

“Young and headstrong…” the Great Lord snorted. “But… I have a feeling what he said may come true. The boy is strange. That’s why I don’t want to move against him—I want to see whether he can do what he claims.”

“So that’s it,” Caidie said, understanding dawning on her face.

“You should smile more. You look better when you do,” the Great Lord said suddenly.

Caidie’s cheeks flushed. She shot the Great Lord a playful glare. “Why is the Great Lord talking like Kuang Shi?”

“Haha. Beauty should bloom—why hide it? The same with people—be yourself, act by your nature. In that, I rather admire the boy. Though his freewheeling way is a bit lawless—he’ll suffer for it sooner or later.” As he spoke, a trace of schadenfreude crossed the Great Lord’s face, as if he could already see Yang Kai paying for it.

Caidie couldn’t help but purse her lips in a smile. She had never known the Great Lord had this side to him.

Outside the Nine Peaks, Yang Kai steeled himself.

Working with the yao was like seeking a tiger’s skin—one misstep and there would be no redemption.

Though the Great Lord’s attitude toward him was good, when dealing with such an expert, Yang Kai had to keep his guard up fully.

After all, no one knew whether the next moment he would turn on him.

The gap in strength was still far too wide.

The Great Yao Lord could be on friendly terms with the old Saint Lord because they stood on the same height, equals who could forge friendship. Yang Kai might be the old Saint Lord’s successor, but he was only at the Second Stage of the Transcendent Realm. In the Great Lord’s eyes, that wasn’t much.

He quietly sent out his Divine Sense. Only after confirming no one was following did Yang Kai relax.

He was certain that if he stayed in the Sacred Land any longer, he likely wouldn’t be able to leave—the Great Lord would definitely force him to stay and refine pills for him.
