## Chapter 2470 — Fighting Over Territory

After quite a while, Yang Kai finally let out a slow breath, took out a fresh set of clothes, and put them on. The wounds on his body, corroded earlier, were healing at a speed visible to the naked eye. The scabs soon fell off, revealing brand new skin.

"Gulp!" The onlooker couldn't help but swallow, his face full of shock.

Yang Kai turned his head and looked at the man. In the next instant, his figure flickered, and he suddenly appeared right in front of him.

This man cultivated at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. In the entire Shattered Star Sea, such cultivation wasn't high, nor was it low—just a bit below average. He looked rather shifty, with a rat-like face, not the sort who seemed trustworthy.

Seeing Yang Kai appear before him, the man jumped in fright, hurriedly took two steps back, and exclaimed in alarm, "W-what do you want?"

Yang Kai looked at him with clear displeasure and snorted coldly, "I just heard you say this is the Origin Sea?"

"Y-yes, that's right! This is the Origin Sea!" The man's tongue seemed to twist as he stammered out his reply.

"What is the Origin Sea? Explain it to me clearly."

The man wore a bitter expression and said, "The Origin Sea is just the Origin Sea... A huge amount of Origin Power gathers here, and since it looks like an ocean, everyone calls it the Origin Sea. There's not much more to it."

"How did you find this place? Why are there so many people here?" Yang Kai asked coldly, staring at him.

"I came with my Senior Brother. He was called over by someone else... Friend, what exactly do you want to know?" The man seemed to calm down, seeing that Yang Kai didn't mean him much harm, and looked at him curiously.

"Tell me about the Origin Sea. Everything you know."

The man looked at him suspiciously, "Friend, haven't you heard of the Origin Sea?"

Yang Kai slapped him and said angrily, "If I'd heard of it, would I need to ask you?"

The man's head shrank from the blow. Though angry inside, he didn't dare show it and said in shock, "No way, friend, your cultivation isn't weak. How could you not have heard of the Origin Sea? This place should be recorded in the classics of every Sect."

"It's recorded everywhere?" Yang Kai raised his eyebrows.

"That's right! The Origin Sea is a famous place in the Shattered Star Sea. It's renowned because of the vast amount of Origin Power gathered here. Once you find this place, you can stay and absorb Origin Power without having to search for those scattered Stellar Origins anymore. But the Origin Sea doesn't appear every time—the timing and location are unpredictable. Out of every three times the Shattered Star Sea opens, the Origin Sea will show up at least once. It's truly a paradise for cultivators like us!"

"There's only Origin Power here? What about that deep blue glow—what is it, and why does it have such strong corrosive power?" Yang Kai asked in a deep voice. He had just suffered from that blue glow. It looked like seawater, and even Divine Sense probing didn't reveal any danger, but once he plunged in, he felt a powerful corrosive force. If he hadn't retreated quickly, he would have been much more seriously injured.

"No one really knows what that blue glow is. It's been here since the Origin Sea first appeared, but it's very dangerous. Anyone who charges in will die for sure..." As he spoke, he suddenly remembered that Yang Kai had just come out alive. He gave an awkward smile and said, "Friend, you're impressive to have made it out of there."

"All thanks to you!" Yang Kai replied with a sneer.

This guy had just been watching from not far away. When he saw Yang Kai rush in, he didn't even give a warning. True, they had no relationship, but to just sit and watch was pretty heartless.

If it had been a slightly weaker cultivator who charged in recklessly, they'd be dead for sure. Still, you couldn't really blame others—everyone had the right to watch coldly from the sidelines.

The man also realized Yang Kai was blaming him and gave an embarrassed smile.

"Keep talking!" Yang Kai snorted.

The man quickly cleared his throat and said, "The benefits you can get in the Origin Sea are huge. Many people who find this place will stay here, absorbing and refining Origin Power until the Shattered Star Sea closes. Friend, you can see for yourself—the Origin Sea is vast, just like a real ocean. No matter how many people come, it's impossible to refine all the Origin Power. And... let me tell you a secret: in the Origin Sea, there isn't just broken Origin Power. Some people have even found complete Stellar Origins and Five Elements Origins!"

"Complete Origins?" Yang Kai's expression changed.

He himself was a Star Lord, so he naturally understood the huge difference between broken Origin Power and complete Origins. Complete Origins allowed cultivators to easily sense the Martial Dao, while broken ones were much less effective.

He hadn't expected that the Origin Sea would contain complete Origin Power, and not just Stellar Origins, but also Five Elements Origins.

The True Phoenix Fire he obtained earlier was also Fire Elemental Origin Power, but that was Divine Spirit Origin, not Five Elements Origin Power. There was a difference between the two.

The reason his Xuan Realm Pearl couldn't let people break through to higher realms inside was because the world's laws weren't complete. To perfect them, complete Origin Power was essential.

If he could find complete Origin Power here and infuse it into the Small Xuan Realm, perhaps its world's laws would become whole. Then, future breakthroughs could be made inside the Small Xuan Realm without worrying about outside interference.

So, after hearing there were complete Origins in the Origin Sea, Yang Kai was instantly tempted.

But soon, he frowned and said, "The Origin Sea is so dangerous—how can you safely absorb and refine Origin Power inside? Are you trying to trick me?"

"I wouldn't dare!" The man looked aggrieved and shouted, "Friend, you haven't gone into the Origin Sea, so you don't know what it's like inside. There are many places like small islands where you can land. In those places, you don't have to worry about the corrosive force of the Origin Sea and can safely refine Origin Power."

"Oh? There are such good spots!" Yang Kai's eyes lit up. He'd only charged into the Origin Sea earlier and hadn't gone deeper, so he hadn't noticed any island-like places.

Judging by the man's tone, he didn't seem to be lying.

"Friend, fly over and take a look from above later. Just don't recklessly dive into what looks like seawater again." The man seemed to offer a kind reminder, then looked at Yang Kai ingratiatingly. "I've told you everything... so..."

"Hmph!" Yang Kai said with a stern face, "Since the Origin Sea has so many benefits, why are you still hanging around here instead of going in? Is there some other danger?"

The man hurriedly said, "I'm waiting here for my other Senior Brothers. The eldest Senior Brother told me to stay here. Do you think I want to be here? I want to go in and absorb Origin Power too!"

He looked aggrieved, probably cursing his eldest Senior Brother in his heart.

Only then did Yang Kai nod, turn around, and fly toward the sky above the Origin Sea.

A voice came from behind, "Be careful! There are several Emperor Realm experts in the Origin Sea right now. If you provoke them, no one can save you."

Yang Kai's heart sank as he realized things were just as he'd suspected—quite a few people had already broken through to the Emperor Realm in the Shattered Star Sea. Zi Yu and Feng Xi weren't the only ones.

And that was just the situation in the Origin Sea. What about the other experts scattered throughout the Shattered Star Sea?

Perhaps, there were quite a few who had reached the Emperor Realm.

The Shattered Star Sea truly was an extraordinary secret realm.

Yang Kai flew over the Origin Sea with a solemn expression, and a strange sense of incongruity stirred as he looked down.

It was as if he were flying over a vast ocean, with blue waves surging below, tides rising and falling. On this sea, there were indeed some island-like places, varying in size. The smallest could only hold one person, the largest four or five at most.

All these landing spots were already occupied by cultivators, sitting cross-legged and absorbing the Origin Power drifting out of the seawater.

On the sea's surface, the tides surged—sometimes raging, sometimes calm—making it impossible to predict.

In such conditions, cultivators couldn't safely refine Origin Power on the sea itself.

It seemed he had to find a landing spot first. Yang Kai had already suffered from the seawater, so he knew how dangerous it was. Without a place to stand, there was no way to safely refine Origin Power.

With that in mind, he scanned below, searching for a suitable spot.

There were actually quite a few cultivators searching for landing spots like him, all flying through the air. But no one seemed interested in fighting each other. The Origin Power here was so dense that as long as you could absorb it peacefully, you'd gain huge benefits. Fighting was pointless—unless it was to seize territory.

There really were people fighting over territory. As Yang Kai flew overhead, he saw at least a dozen groups locked in fierce battle. Corpses of cultivators kept falling from the sky, and as soon as they hit the Origin Sea, they vanished without a trace, not even making a splash.

After circling above the Origin Sea for an hour, Yang Kai still hadn't found a place to land. Every spot was already occupied.

This left him quite helpless.

His nature wasn't the type to snatch territory from others for no reason, so he could only keep searching patiently. Fortunately, the Origin Sea was big enough, and there were still places he hadn't checked.

He believed he would find a good spot.

Up ahead, another group was fighting fiercely over territory, the sky dark with battle and energy raging.

Yang Kai originally planned to fly around the battlefield, but just then, a low chant suddenly reached his ears.

"Earth Sword... Falling Thunder!"

As the voice rang out, a series of crackling explosions followed. In the sky over there, a blue bolt of lightning suddenly tore through the heavens and shot toward a certain spot.

His expression changed, and he quickly looked over.
