## Chapter 123 — Inheritance Celestial Cave

“Beast souls?” Meng Wuya’s eyes suddenly bulged, fixating unblinkingly on the two colossal figures before him.

A supremely powerful demon beast, even after its physical body perishes, can have its soul linger in the world, awaiting the right moment to be resurrected. Dragons and phoenixes, as kings among demon beasts, naturally possess the ability to preserve their souls from extinction.

Having seen much, Meng Wuya initially thought these two enormous shapes were the beast souls of a dragon and phoenix when he first saw them. Yet upon closer inspection, his brow furrowed, for he could detect no trace of soul energy from these two figures.

They were nothing but lifeless objects.

These two immense and unmatched forms were, in fact, dragon-shaped and phoenix-shaped seals purely formed from the convergence of Heaven and Earth energies!

“Something is amiss here!” Meng Wuya immediately became alert. Lowering his gaze, he saw the ground beneath his feet had sunk dozens of zhang. Deeper within the pit, there were subtle fluctuations of profound formations, though these formations had already been broken.

It turned out that the aftershocks of the battle between himself and the many Blood Battle Gang experts had shattered the formations here, thereby releasing the dragon and phoenix seals from their confinement.

This was an unexpected turn! Meng Wuya pondered thoughtfully and glanced at the Blood Battle Gang members, noticing they all stood dumbfounded, gazing skyward with eyes full of shock and confusion.

They did not know the secret of this place? Meng Wuya frowned. Indeed, the formations had likely remained intact until now, so they were unaware of what exactly had been sealed within. But they must have been in the process of breaking it, reaching the final stage—otherwise, the aftershocks of their battle would not have completely unsealed it.

While Meng Wuya was deep in thought, the two gigantic figures in the sky had already begun to intertwine.

Their bodies stretched over a hundred zhang, one blazing red, the other icy blue. As they merged, the world was filled with a radiant brilliance, an overwhelming clash of scorching heat and chilling cold energy that swept outward, instilling all who witnessed it with an irresistible sense of awe.

“Retreat!” Hu Man roared furiously, leading the Blood Battle Gang members in a swift withdrawal.

Meng Wuya also retreated. Though his strength was profound, he could not withstand such a powerful energy assault.

The roar of a dragon echoed, deafening and resounding.

The cry of a phoenix rang out, high-pitched and clear.

The dragon and phoenix circled endlessly in the sky, a symbol of auspicious harmony.

After a long moment, both dove headlong back to the spot from which they had emerged.

A thunderous explosion shook the heavens and earth, stirring a sense of cataclysm in everyone’s hearts. Accompanying this was a surge of Yuan Qi far more intense than before, enveloping the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area in a light as bright as daylight.

Moments later, the light gradually faded, and the fluctuations of Yuan Qi calmed, as if the world itself had fallen silent in that instant.

Meng Wuya hovered midair, quietly peering down. His face twitched uncontrollably, eyes bulging as he exclaimed, “An Inheritance Celestial Cave?”

As he spoke, Meng Wuya found himself unable to restrain his body, stepping forward repeatedly to get a clearer look.

What lay before him was undoubtedly an Inheritance Celestial Cave.

The mining area below had been leveled, leaving only a massive pit some ten zhang deep. A layer of luminous barrier obscured the view within.

On the barrier, mysterious characters and patterns danced continuously, like joyful fish swimming freely.

How could this be? How could such a small place harbor an Inheritance Celestial Cave? Meng Wuya almost thought he was dreaming, yet the reality before him was undeniable.

An Inheritance Celestial Cave is a wondrous and profound space condensed by a supreme cultivator at the moment of death, embodying their lifetime of cultivation.

Within this space lies the entirety of the master’s knowledge. To enter it is to receive a tremendous boon.

Moreover, such a cave often contains treasures once owned by the cultivator—elixirs, secret treasures, and more.

To condense an Inheritance Celestial Cave, one must be a being of unimaginable strength—one who has transcended the extraordinary and reached the realm of Enlightenment and Divine Transformation.

A Divine Roaming Realm cultivator is but an ant before such a figure!

Indeed, an Inheritance Celestial Cave is a treasure trove rivaling a wealthy nation. Whoever gains the inheritance within is destined to reach the heights of that master, so long as they survive.

The formation of this particular cave must have been a grand event, indicating that its owner was no minor figure—likely a rare jewel among the top echelon.

Meng Wuya’s emotions stirred deeply. The appearance of an Inheritance Celestial Cave here was utterly unfathomable.

His excitement was shared and even amplified by the Blood Battle Gang members.

The ancient formation buried dozens of zhang underground had been unwittingly broken—a truly momentous event. Hu Man and the others immediately recognized this as the legendary Inheritance Celestial Cave, filled with abundant treasures and transcendent martial arts, enough to drive anyone mad with desire.

Yet, they soon realized the gravity of the situation.

Such a commotion would surely alert the other two sects nearby. Even if the Blood Battle Gang wished to claim the cave’s riches alone, it would be impossible.

Though this was their mining area and they had broken the formation, the entrance was so large that others could easily enter. Could they block it?

To do so would only enrage the other two factions. Fengyu Tower and Lingxiao Pavilion would undoubtedly unite to annihilate the Blood Battle Gang first, then slowly scheme to seize the treasures here.

With this in mind, Hu Man waved his hand: “Let’s go in first!”

Fearing the arrival of other sects’ experts to snatch the treasures, he naturally led his men to take the lead. Even if others came, they would only have to surrender minor spoils.

At his command, ten Divine Roaming Realm experts of the Blood Battle Gang charged toward the mining pit, eyes burning with fanatic zeal. Yet they remained wary of Meng Wuya, fearing his intervention. After the previous battle, all knew this mad old man was not to be trifled with.

Yet Meng Wuya merely sneered coldly, indifferent, standing his ground and watching.

Hu Man and the others were overjoyed, thinking, “Just don’t come over. If you do, we’ll have to stop you this time.”

The ten Divine Roaming Realm experts reached the edge of the giant pit and, without hesitation, dove headfirst into the mysterious luminous barrier below.

Meng Wuya’s sneer deepened, a trace of mockery lingering on his face.

Just as Hu Man’s group, faces alight with excitement, were about to enter the Inheritance Celestial Cave, the barrier before them flickered slightly and bounced them back.

Like rubber balls, the ten were flung high into the air, spinning several times before hovering midair, exchanging bewildered glances.

“What’s going on?” Hu Man muttered, refusing to believe it. He charged again, only to be repelled once more upon touching the barrier.

Only then did Hu Man realize something was amiss. He glanced at Meng Wuya, who stood calm and composed. It was clear the old man had discerned something earlier and thus had not stopped them.

Lowering his posture, Hu Man cupped his hands and asked respectfully, “Esteemed senior, may I ask if this is truly an Inheritance Celestial Cave below?”

Meng Wuya snorted, rolling his eyes without replying. The appearance of the Inheritance Celestial Cave had drained his interest in troubling Long Zaitian further. After all, Long Zaitian had already lost most of his life, and Meng Wuya himself had suffered losses. Continuing the fight would only lead to mutual destruction.

Hu Man felt awkward. Just as he frowned in thought, the sound of fluttering robes came from afar.

The Blood Battle Gang experts’ expressions changed, bitter and tense. “They’ve arrived so soon!”
	
Moments later, the five Elders of Lingxiao Pavilion, led by Wei Xitong, appeared above the mining area. Soon after, Divine Roaming Realm experts from Fengyu Tower, led by Tower Master Xiao Ruohan, also arrived.

Upon arrival, both sides were stunned, their gazes filled with greed and delight as they looked down at the Inheritance Celestial Cave.

Hu Man growled angrily, “This is the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area. Your uninvited arrival is hardly appropriate.”

Xiao Ruohan, looking like a refined scholar, smiled and said, “Chief Hu, your words are too formal. The Blood Battle Gang and Fengyu Tower have been neighbors for centuries. We are old acquaintances. Now that such a great event has occurred here, Fengyu Tower naturally must investigate. If your gang requires assistance, we will not refuse. I believe the Lingxiao Pavilion elders share this sentiment. Elder Wei, what say you?”

The implication was clear: to form a temporary alliance with Lingxiao Pavilion to pressure the Blood Battle Gang. Hu Man was not blind to this and snorted coldly, his expression darkening.

Wei Xitong nodded, “Tower Master Xiao’s words are reasonable. Chief Hu, this must be the legendary Inheritance Celestial Cave. Though it contains countless treasures, it surely hides many dangers. Your gang is outnumbered and venturing in alone would be unwise. Why not let the three factions discuss and explore it together?”

Hu Man retorted angrily, “On what grounds? This is the Blood Battle Gang’s mining area, and we broke the formation. You have contributed nothing and have no right to enter.”

Meng Wuya interjected coldly, “I am the one who broke the formation!”

Hu Man’s face flushed awkwardly. He glared resentfully at Meng Wuya but dared not argue.

Xiao Ruohan smiled, “Chief Hu, please do not be angry. We can discuss this.”

As the experts bickered, disciples from the three factions were already rushing toward the site like mad.

Whether inside their sects or in the Black Wind Trade Market, everyone had clearly witnessed the dragon and phoenix intertwining in the sky. Though they did not understand what had happened, such a magnificent spectacle could not be missed. Even if only to watch the commotion.

Thus, after a brief panic, the crowd surged forward with increasing speed. The entire Black Wind Forest suddenly boiled with excitement.

Yang Kai was among them, moving with the crowd. Though his heart stirred, he remained cautious.

The grandeur of the dragon and phoenix was overwhelming. If it truly signaled the birth of a treasure, it would surely bring bloodshed and chaos. His mind was clear—if he sensed danger ahead, he would turn back immediately. With his current strength, he was not yet qualified to engage in fierce battles.

Yet even as he arrived at the Blood Battle Gang mining area with the throng, no crisis had yet descended.

Nearly ten thousand disciples from the three factions had gathered here, the crowd bustling like a vast marketplace, lively and chaotic.
