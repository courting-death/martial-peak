## Chapter 514 — Will I Let You Go?

Who could withstand the might of a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure?

Unless it was another Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure of equal defensive power, just like the Bone Shield in Yang Kai’s hand!

When the seven or eight electric dragons darted out from the beast mouths at the center of the Bone Shield, everyone was stunned, their faces instantaneously filled with terror and dread. The call of death resonated in their ears, and no one could remain calm.

If there were still experts present, they might have been able to rely on their transcendent skills to block the electric dragons’ assault, but their experts were restrained or frozen, leaving the rest powerless to resist.

Chaos erupted. People were thrown about, panic overtaking them as they scattered in all directions, desperate to flee and avoid the deadly electric dragons.

Xiang Chu’s mind remained relatively clear as he shouted for everyone to unite and resist, but the chaotic scene rendered him helpless. Even Qiu Ziru had fled; why would anyone else stay behind to await death?

Boom! Boom! Boom! —

Crackling sounds…

Those electric dragons were like invincible blades wrapped in unparalleled power, rampaging through the crowd. Anyone touched was instantly convulsing and collapsing, some even scorched black from being electrocuted.

The few remaining Divine Roaming Realm experts shielded their young masters, dodging the electric dragons’ attacks with the desperation of stray dogs.

Wails echoed relentlessly. In the face of a Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure’s power, human lives were cheaper than grass.

Kang Zhan, who had been cultivating and healing, slowly opened his eyes and stared at the tragic scene. His heart chilled.

It dawned on him that Yang Kai had spoken truthfully.

By forbidding Lingxiao Pavilion’s people from intervening, he truly was thinking of him and his allies! Nan Sheng had only wounded one young disciple of Lingxiao Pavilion, yet such slaughter was unleashed. If Lingxiao Pavilion had suffered heavy casualties due to the chaos, then would he still be lucky enough to live to return to War City?

Kang Zhan no longer dared to dwell on it. His expression darkened as he shut his eyes and ceased paying attention to the fighting.

Meanwhile, the Lingxiao Pavilion group grew suddenly excited; their faces flushed red, fists clenched tight.

The humiliation and restraint they endured earlier seemed to be regained in full in this moment.

Yang Kai, relying on only himself, had sent the warriors from seven factions into utter disarray, forcing them into hiding and preventing them from even launching any effective counterattack.

Suddenly, bursts of purple mystical light shattered in midair, sending out wave upon wave of visible ripples like stones tossed onto a serene lake, enveloping the warriors cowering from the electric dragons’ assault.

Buried within those ripples were fiercely destructive Divine Sense attacks.

Soul techniques! Yang Kai unleashed his Divine Sense abilities recklessly and without holding back.

Where his Divine Sense spread, most warriors suddenly showed dull, pained expressions, as if some malevolent presence had invaded their minds, leaving them clueless and dumbstruck.

The electric dragons then electrocuted them into charcoal.

Only the Divine Roaming Realm experts could somewhat resist this soul technique, though their expressions were painful as well.

The nauseating scent of burning flesh filled the entire battlefield.

After some time, the electric dragons gradually dissipated into the air. The power of the Mystery-Grade Secret Treasure had finally expended. Yang Kai ceased his Divine Sense attacks. The wilderness was covered in wails, with countless casualties.

Originally nearly three hundred warriors from the seven factions were now down to fewer than two hundred.

Bodies littered the ground, unrecognizable blackened charcoal. Wisps of pale smoke rose from the corpses like slender cooking smoke spirals.

Qiu Ziru, at some point, had collapsed on the ground, eyes vacant, his teeth chattering fiercely.

Having narrowly escaped death, his feelings were complicated.

Compared to others, he was almost unscathed.

He had entered the Succession War with confidence, unconcerned about survival. But today, he dared not think that way.

He did not know if Yang Kai had spared him out of regard for Qiu Yimeng or if he was simply lucky to avoid the electric dragons’ attacks. But Yang Kai’s massacre struck deep fear into him.

A dark shadow loomed in his heart, seeming always to mock him and thirst for his life.

“Young Master Qiu, run!” a Divine Roaming Realm warrior from some faction saw Qiu Ziru’s dazed state and hurriedly pulled him up, fleeing without looking back toward War City.

Faced with a man who had dared to seriously wound Kang Zhan, they had lost the will to fight. Now all they wanted was to get as far away as possible.

Most shared this sentiment and scrambled to their feet, fleeing without a second thought.

“Why run?” Xiang Chu roared. “His secret treasure cannot be used again. After such an attack, now is when his energy is exhausted. We should seize the chance and finish him. Young Master Qiu! Young Master Qiu! Where is Young Master Qiu?”

No one heeded his shouts. Xiang Chu had no authority to command, and even if he did, no one was willing to stay in that living hell.

While shouting, Xiang Chu suddenly sensed a piercing gaze upon him.

Looking up, he met Yang Kai’s cold eyes.

His heart skipped a beat. Unconsciously, he took several steps back.

“Young Brother Xiang, leave now. This is a matter not worth pursuing,” Nan Sheng rushed up and pulled him away.

Xiang Chu bit his lip, glared venomously and resentfully at Yang Kai, and then stamped his foot. “Let’s go.”

A bunch of cowards! How could one accomplish great things allied with such people? Xiang Chu silently cursed, imagining how different things might have been if he hadn’t offended Yang Kai at Taifang Mountain that day, or if Yang Kai had accepted his goodwill, and he could have risen by his side.

But the past was irreversible. Xiang Chu only blamed his own shortsightedness for offending such a man.

The seven factions, some fleeing, some dead, vanished like a flash.

“Do you think I will let you go?” Yang Kai’s voice suddenly echoed in everyone’s ears. Although quiet, it was crystal clear, sending a chill through all.

Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu glanced back while fleeing, relieved to see Yang Kai still standing quietly, not pursuing. They thought he was bluffing, then quickened their pace to reach War City and hide in Yang Zhao’s estate, planning to wait until Yang Kai’s anger subsided or to have Yang Zhao mediate.

Yang Kai’s Qi and blood surged fiercely, revealing his inner unrest. He glanced at the unconscious Su Mu and the bloodshot-eyed Su Yan and said, “Wait half a day before setting out again. By then, Su Mu should be out of danger.”

Su Yan was startled and asked, “What about you?”

“Anyone who harms members of the sect must pay the price!”

With those words said, he streaked away like a shooting rainbow, filled with fearsome killing intent.

The survivors from the seven factions struggled to escape, and only after more than a hundred li did they begin to ease, glancing back to see no pursuers and breathing sighs of relief.

Recalling what had just happened, every one shuddered in horror, thankful to be alive.

Only twenty or so gathered together; most had already fled far beyond.

“Should be safe now, right?” someone nervously asked. Others said nothing, panting heavily.

“That Ninth Young Master treats human life like nothing…”

The remark drew general agreement.

“And that Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu, if it weren’t for those two fools, would we be in such a mess?”

“What did you say?” someone stood up angrily. “Our Young Master Nan is thinking of the bigger picture. Who the hell are you to insult him?”

“Am I wrong? For the sake of the bigger picture, what a joke! Nan Sheng and Xiang Chu clearly sought revenge, dragging that group into this. Do you think we don’t know the Nan and Xiang families have suffered losses under the Ninth Young Master’s hand before? This Succession War is just payback!”

“You’re full of shit!”

“I’m just speaking the truth. You Nan and Xiang families think you can contend with the Yang family’s young master? Open your eyes. Even if the Second Young Master had won the Succession War, what could Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng do to Yang Kai? At most vent frustration.”

“Are you from the Nan family?” As they argued, a low voice suddenly sounded beside them.

The defender of Nan Sheng straightened and proudly said, “So what if I am?”

Before he finished, a blood-red flower petal suddenly pierced his head. His eyes widened as he collapsed backward, his consciousness blurred by the terrifying figure etched in his mind.

“Nin… Ninth Young Master…” When they saw the killer was Yang Kai, everyone’s faces changed, and they hurriedly stood, staring at him in terror.

They hadn’t expected Yang Kai to truly catch up.

Among these twenty or so, only one was a Divine Roaming Realm warrior, and just a third-stage one at that. His faction was unknown.

Upon seeing Yang Kai appear, the group instinctively clustered around that Divine Roaming Realm warrior, seeking some measure of safety.

The third-stage Divine Roaming warrior swallowed hard.

He was indeed Divine Roaming Realm but far from powerful. Yang Kai could fight to a stalemate with Liu Qingyao and would easily handle him.

He knew he was no match for Liu Qingyao.

Yet what eased him was that after killing the Nan family warrior, Yang Kai did not continue attacking. Instead, he fixed his gaze on them and asked, “Who else here belongs to the Nan or Xiang families?”

The group exchanged glances, suddenly understanding Yang Kai’s intentions.

Grievances have a source, debts have owners. The Ninth Young Master was intent on wiping out the Nan and Xiang families’ forces utterly!

No one dared speak. Speaking too much would be dangerous, and no one could guess what Yang Kai truly meant.
