## Chapter 787 — Wait and See

Outside the Death Arena, countless demons shouted and hurled insults, but none dared to take any rash action.

Inside, the fluctuations of Heaven-and-Earth Energy grew increasingly uncanny and unpredictable.

No one knew how much time passed before a world-shattering wave of energy suddenly erupted, centered on Yang Kai.

The Heaven-and-Earth Energy around him surged like a tidal wave, wildly churning and spiraling, battering against the arena's seals and barriers.

"What terrifying energy!" Yu Mo's eyes abruptly widened, horror flashing across his face, an intense light flickering in his pupils.

Xueli likewise appeared slightly stunned, tilting her head with a strange look. "He truly has the arrogance for it; this energy aura rivals a Third Stage Transcendent. No wonder Di Xiao fell by his hand," she said.

The demons watching this scene wore sour expressions; if Di Xiao had been the one in the arena, ten thousand cheers might have erupted, but since it was a human, they found it hard to accept.

The surging energy ravaged the Death Arena; Yang Kai closed his eyes, a look of profound gain and comfort on his face, and the faint golden radiance surrounding him grew ever more dazzling.

After a long while, the violent energy suddenly rushed back and, within mere breaths, was completely absorbed into Yang Kai's body.

The chaotic Death Arena instantly calmed and cleared considerably.

Looking at Yang Kai now, the demons' expressions dulled and their hearts ached, yet they could not voice a sound.

The grievously wounded Yang Kai from his fierce battle with Di Xiao found his cuts healing at an eerie pace; minor wounds vanished entirely and even major injuries became negligible.

Xueli's beautiful pupils contracted; she licked her blood-red, gem-bright lips with a lustful look, eyes blazing as she stared at Yang Kai, visibly excited.

In the Death Arena Yang Kai closed his fist, feeling the power flowing through him, utterly satisfied.

This breakthrough came naturally, without the slightest obstruction.

The hard-fought battles and the many insights of recent months had been like nourishment, feeding his body and Divine Sense and bringing him to the brink of a breakthrough. After the fierce clash with Di Xiao, he immediately glimpsed the mysteries of the Second Stage Transcendent.

The density and robustness of his True Yuan rose a rank, and even the power of his Divine Sense was refined and strengthened beyond before.

Yang Kai was utterly pleased. The only regret was that he had broken through inside the Death Arena, before so many demons.

Especially with Xueli watching!

He had long perceived Xueli's intent to kill him and had guarded against this powerful woman at every turn, but her massive superiority in strength left him helpless.

Although he did not understand why she had protected his breakthrough this time, Xueli was not to be trusted; it would be best to leave Sand City as soon as possible.

With that thought, Yang Kai turned toward where Xueli stood and called out loudly, "Lady Xueli, does your earlier promise still stand?"

Xueli narrowed her lovely eyes and laughed softly, "What did I say?"

"You said that if I won this battle you would let me and my companion leave! Lady Xueli, you wouldn't renege now, would you?" Yang Kai shouted again, his voice carrying to every demon.

Xueli snorted, staring coldly at Yang Kai from afar, her beautiful eyes full of hidden hatred.

Although they had indeed made such an agreement before, Xueli had no intention of honoring it; with Yang Kai forcing the matter before the crowd, she had to give it some thought.

If a demon general's words were not kept, it would greatly harm Xueli's reputation.

"You brat!" Xueli ground her teeth, furious that Yang Kai was forcing her hand, yet unable to refuse him publicly.

"My lady, he's courting death!" Yu Mo sneered mockingly. "Let him leave—he'll die without our intervention!"

As he spoke he glanced toward Feng Biao a short distance away, whose face was filled with killing intent; Yu Mo knew Feng Biao was the most eager to see Yang Kai dead.

"The point is I don't want him dead right now!" Xueli snorted.

Yu Mo was stunned and dared not press the matter.

"Lady Xueli, you won't go back on your word?" Yang Kai called a third time from within the Death Arena, a strange smile on his face.

Xueli drew a soft breath, her full bosom heaving exaggeratedly. She rose slowly and declared loudly, "Of course not. You and your companion are free to go; leave whenever you wish, and no one will stop you!"

Yang Kai fixed her with a deep gaze and cupped his fist, "Thank you, Lord Xueli!"

With that he burst up from the Death Arena and shot toward Xueli, arriving before her in moments, seizing An Ling'er and hissing, "Go!"

"Boy, I believe we'll meet again before long!" Xueli suddenly murmured, and her words reached Yang Kai. He felt a chill and glanced back to find her watching him with eyes full of meaning.

Lowly wench! Yang Kai cursed inwardly, certain Xueli had no intention of letting him leave easily; before the crowd she had agreed to preserve her reputation, but behind the scenes she would surely use tricks.

They would likely send pursuers the moment they left.

Yang Kai's eyes flashed; he replied aloud, "I doubt we'll meet again!"

"Wait and see!" Xueli snorted coldly.

Yang Kai and An Ling'er shot upward and vanished like lightning.

From the stands, those demons furious enough to tear Yang Kai limb from limb upon seeing him brazenly depart quietly rose and set off in groups of three to five, tailing him.

Xueli and Yu Mo watched all of it, feigning ignorance and offering no real obstruction.

Feng Biao, the man Gou Qiong had dispatched, stood in place, his face dark with thought; after a long look at Xueli he grinned, then vanished in a flash.

"Lady, it seems they all gave chase—this boy is in grave danger!" Yu Mo warned softly.

Even setting Feng Biao aside—that First Stage Saint tailing him—Yang Kai would already be hard-pressed; dealing with the demon clansmen alone was enough to give him a headache.

Although he was formidable and had only just broken through a Stage, after battling Di Xiao for so long he had likely burned through seven or eight tenths of his strength and could scarcely bring out much combat power.

If those pursuers caught up, death would be his only road!

"Hm, he's doomed!" Xueli bit her lip, appearing displeased. "The brat has himself to blame; if he hadn't left, I wouldn't have killed him, but he chose a path to his own doom."

"Then..."

"Go fetch him and bring him back!" Xueli ordered coldly. "Under no circumstances let others take his life."

"Yes!" Yu Mo accepted the command and struck out at once.

"Hmph, if you say we'll never meet again, I'll be eager to see your expression when you see me!" Xueli laughed softly, rose with grace, and headed toward her palace to await the moment Yang Kai would be captured and returned.

Outside Sand City, Yang Kai and An Ling'er sped away, reaching an extreme velocity that dragged long afterimages behind them.

"Are you alright?" An Ling'er asked anxiously. She had watched the deadly fight with Di Xiao and knew how severely Yang Kai had been injured; he should be recuperating rather than recklessly burning True Yuan.

"I'm fine," Yang Kai shook his head.

He knew his own body; the Demon God's Blood coursing through him had astonishing regenerative power. In former times such grievous wounds would have required long recovery, but now the Demon God's Blood granted him incredible healing, allowing rapid recovery; though not fully healed, he could move without much hindrance.

He also need not worry about insufficient True Yuan: his Dantian still held hundreds of drops of Yang Liquid, and the Black Book Space contained sixty to seventy Divine Tree fruits, all capable of replenishing his True Yuan.

"It seems someone is pursuing us!" An Ling'er suddenly cried, her face paling.

"Not someone—many people!" Yang Kai's expression remained calm; with his domineering Divine Sense he had already ascertained the number and strength of their pursuers.

There were numerous Transcendent Realm cultivators and also a few Saint Realm practitioners.

Behind them loomed Feng Biao, whose qi had locked onto him like a bone-deep parasite, impossible to shake off.

Behind Feng Biao rode Yu Mo!

Sure enough Xueli had sent him; Yang Kai cursed inwardly, vowing to teach the viperish woman a lesson someday.

Nearly half of Sand City's forces had been drawn out in pursuit of him.

Yang Kai was displeased, though he showed no sign of it, continuing at his steady speed.

The demonic pursuers had unleashed their Secret Treasures as they left Sand City and gave full chase, gradually closing the distance little by little.

After scarcely an hour Yang Kai had flown only a few hundred li and already the pursuers were about to catch up.

An Ling'er frantically poured a series of miraculous talismans into Yang Kai, helping his True Yuan flow and boosting his speed.

"They won't catch us," Yang Kai assured her; he maintained this velocity only to wait for an opportunity.

In his perception, most of those on their tail were no real threat—once the Soul Devouring Worms appeared, they would all perish.

The only ones to fear were the few Saint Realm experts mixed among them, and the two behind—Feng Biao and Yu Mo—these were the troubling ones.

Sensing Feng Biao and Yu Mo keeping a delicate distance—neither too near nor too far, just at the limit of their Divine Sense—Yang Kai immediately felt the opportunity had arrived!
