## Chapter 1466 — Life Jade Nectar

A moment later, Yang Kai drew a deep breath and took the lead into the maze, Biluo following silently at his side.

Such maze-like terrain often hid many seals and formations, and now that the Imperial Garden had officially opened, the dangers had increased greatly; Yang Kai did not dare be careless — the World-Ending Demon Eye ran constantly, probing the surroundings to avoid accidentally triggering any formation.

It was not until two days later that Yang Kai led Biluo out from another direction of the labyrinth; both looked somewhat exhausted and still visibly shaken.

A large part of their ability to leave the maze was down to Yang Kai's memory, and a little bit of luck.

Unlike the day when the maze contained only formations, Yang Kai and Biluo actually encountered many ancient puppets inside; each of those ancient puppets differed in form and power, but without exception they were all at the Origin Returning Realm level, the strongest astonishingly having reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm, which indeed caused Yang Kai no small trouble.

Fortunately, Yang Kai was not an ordinary Origin Returning Realm cultivator; charging through, relying on the might of the Dragon Bone sword and the powerful Artifact Spirit Fire Bird, and aided by the domineering strength of the Stone Puppet, they escaped with no serious mishap.

The Stone Puppet in particular had a strong restraining effect on those ancient puppets.

After passing that maze, two arched circular gates suddenly appeared ahead, one black and one white, looking extremely strange: the white seemed crafted from white jade, while the black exuded a grim yin aura, the contrast striking.

Behind those two arched gates lay a piece of chaotic void; Divine Sense probing into it could detect nothing, and on the surface it looked like a lake, unfathomably deep.

Biluo was taken aback and cried out, "A Spatial Array Gate!"

Yang Kai glanced at her unexpectedly and nodded, "Not bad, you actually recognize this."

"Mm, I've seen it before," Biluo's expression turned grave. "Which one should we go into?"

"I'll tell you in a moment. Rest for a while first." Yang Kai smiled faintly; the last time he had been here he and Fei Zhi Tu and the others had also agonized for quite some time over which Spatial Array Gate to choose — being forced to pick between two options was genuinely troublesome, and ordinary people would generally incline toward the white, since black often signified danger and deception.

But in truth, whichever Spatial Array Gate one chose, there was not much real peril; only the destination differed.

Fei Zhi Tu and the others had entered the white Spatial Array Gate that day; there they encountered a jade coffin that triggered the Imperial Garden's formation, causing the Imperial Garden to manifest, and within that coffin someone lay quietly.

Starry Sky Emperor!

The earth-shattering battle tens of thousands of years ago had left the Emperor in slumber; the Imperial Garden was the place of her sleep. Yang Kai had heard these details from Yang Yan, for Yang Yan, as a wisp of the Emperor's Soul Incarnation, had some understanding of those secrets.

That day, Yang Kai had entered through the black-colored Spatial Array Gate along with Du Sisi and the others. It was there that the Origin Returning Realm expert, the old crone, fell — and it was also there that he obtained the Heaven-Shaking Pillar.

Half an hour later, Yang Kai and Biluo had recovered; at Yang Kai's direction they stepped toward the black Spatial Array Gate. Staring at the bottomless void of the gate, Biluo couldn't help feeling nervous and fearful, and reached out to grab Yang Kai's robe.

Yang Kai, however, wore a relaxed expression. With a motion he brought her along and dashed into the black gate; a peculiar sense of weightlessness enveloped them, a wave of dizziness passed, and when they came to their senses they found themselves somewhere else.

Scanning their surroundings, Yang Kai's face showed delight.

This was indeed the place — the same spot he and that old crone and the others had arrived at after passing through the black Spatial Array Gate.

"Follow me!" Yang Kai called, moving ahead with practiced ease, apparently searching for something as he walked.

Biluo looked puzzled but did not ask further.

This place was plainly garden-like: flowers perfumed the air everywhere, little bridges spanned flowing water, artificial hills rose about — the scenery was oddly refined. Yang Kai inspected each artificial hill as he passed, occasionally shaking his head.

After some time he suddenly brightened and hurried toward one particular artificial hill; there a faint, peculiar fragrance emanated that refreshed the spirit, and even the injured Biluo's complexion improved.

Yang Kai quickly reached the front of that artificial hill, and upon seeing the familiar pool before him he could not help but grin widely: "Found it."

Biluo peeked into the pool with curiosity and found it largely dry, with only a tiny amount of milky-white liquid settled at the bottom.

That faint, strange fragrance was emitted by that small bit of milky-white liquid.

"What is this?" Biluo asked, intrigued.

Yang Kai said nothing; he dipped his hand into the milky liquid at the bottom of the pool, offered his finger to Biluo, and commanded, "Open your mouth!"

Biluo opened her mouth instinctively, and Yang Kai plunged his finger in.

In the next moment Biluo's eyes widened; she stuck out her little tongue and curled it around Yang Kai's finger, licking that mysterious liquid clean.

Visibly her face took on a rosy hue — not from affection or shyness, but because in that instant her Qi and blood surged greatly, the floating Qi and blood caused by her injury resolving.

"Meditate and refine it, don't waste it." Yang Kai wore a strange smile as he ordered.

"Oh." Biluo obediently moved to one side, and before she began she shot Yang Kai a scolding glance.

The two were clearly reminded of their reckless youth, that outrageous incident which had occurred in Shan Qingluo's palace in Piaoxiang City.

Though nearly thirty years had passed, that experience was far too memorable to forget. Especially Biluo’s delicate lips—soft, tender, and rosy—when she spoke or smiled, the glimpse of her small silver-white teeth carried a dangerous charm.

Once Biluo sat cross-legged and began to refine the Life Jade Nectar, Yang Kai turned his eyes and looked excitedly toward the rear of the artificial hill.

When he had first come here he had vaguely suspected that somewhere behind this artificial hill the truly pure Life Jade Nectar was hidden; what he and the old crone and the others had obtained before was merely a diluted product — now it seemed his suspicion was indeed correct.

After all, that day he and the old crone had scraped the pool clean and left nothing behind, yet today some thin Life Jade Nectar had reappeared, which was enough to prove the truth.

Had he been alone, finding the exact hiding spot of the pure Life Jade Nectar might have been difficult, but for today he had come fully prepared.

With a thought, Yang Kai released the Stone Puppet from the Black Book Space, took out a vessel meant for holding liquids and handed it to it, then pointed at the artificial hill.

The Stone Puppet understood; in a flash it dashed and smashed into the artificial hill.

A strange scene unfolded — the moment the Stone Puppet’s body came into contact with the artificial hill, it seemed to turn ethereal, melting straight into it and vanishing without a trace.

Yet in Yang Kai's perception he could vaguely sense the Stone Puppet's position, feeling it burrowing ever inward; it was already over a hundred zhang away, and he stood there expectantly waiting.

The Stone Puppet could even bore a hole through the Thousand Illusions Glazed Mountain of the Liuli Sect, so finding something here was naturally effortless.

In less than the time an incense stick would burn, the Stone Puppet's form suddenly emerged from the artificial hill, joyfully leaping before Yang Kai and opening its mouth to spit out the vessel.

Yang Kai swept it forward with his hand, took the vessel, and sent out his Divine Sense to take a peek inside; he couldn't help but grin broadly.

The vessel contained milky-white liquid roughly one chi square in size; though a liquid, it was extremely viscous, at least ten times as concentrated as the Life Jade Nectar from the pool earlier.

This was the purest Life Jade Nectar, entirely undiluted — one of the Three Divine Waters within the Star Domain!

Yang Kai felt elated.

He had not expected the venture to be so smooth.

On this trip into the Imperial Garden his goals had been only two: one the Heaven and Earth Spirit, the other the Life Jade Nectar. The former had required some twists and turns but was finally obtained, and the latter had been acquired without encountering any obstruction.

All of this was thanks to the Stone Puppet's peculiar abilities; without its help Yang Kai doubted he could have penetrated so far to fetch the Life Jade Nectar.

Now, with so much Life Jade Nectar to aid him, he need no longer worry about the quantity of Golden Blood — he might even replace his own blood entirely with pure Golden Blood; it was no longer an extravagant notion.

After fondling it with delight for a while, Yang Kai solemnly stowed away the Life Jade Nectar.

Biluo opened her eyes at that moment, her face full of joy.

"How do you feel?" Yang Kai asked casually.

"Much better, I should be able to contend with others now." Biluo breathed out lightly; having spent these days under Yang Kai's protection she had been anxious — though Yang Kai's displayed strength was astonishing, this place was the Imperial Garden, teeming with danger, and every additional person meant additional strength.

She could not claim her cultivation fully restored, but at least she was no longer a burden.

"Where are we heading now?" Biluo rose and asked.

"Follow me, there's another good thing over there." Yang Kai grinned, composed.

What he pointed to was naturally the stone stele at the place where Qian Tong had been trapped that day. Qian Tong had risked venturing deep here to bring an artificer to study forging techniques; the stele contained the most profound secrets of forging.

After escaping the Imperial Garden that day, the artificer secluded himself to comprehend those arts; word had come not long ago that he had ascended to the rank of Origin-Grade artificer, revealing the immense value hidden within the stele.

Now that they were here, Yang Kai certainly did not want to miss it; if possible he would even take the stele away.

Besides, if Yang Kai intended to search for Yang Yan he would have to pass by there anyway; it was on the way and should not take much time.
