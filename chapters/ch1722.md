## Chapter 1722 — Star Lord's Might

"Mm." Yang Kai nodded, his expression twisting into something fierce. "Suddenly being used as a bargaining chip against you—this Sect Master is not pleased, Elder Sha. This Jiang Huai'an, should I kill him or not?"

Sha Hu sighed at the words and said, "Spare his life; I will deal with him personally."

"As you wish!"

"If you want to kill me, see if you have the ability!" Jiang Huai'an snarled, his face furious as he glared hatefully at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai's calm, unhurried manner enraged him all the more and left him deeply unsettled—he did not know whether Yang Kai truly had some great backing and was not afraid of the Tidal Azure Wave Formation. After all, rumor had it that Yang Kai had once slain an expert at the peak of the Origin Returning Realm.

However, no matter how formidable an individual’s strength might be, how could it possibly surpass the power of a grand formation? With that thought, the unease in Jiang Huai’an’s heart eased considerably. He stared coldly at Yang Kai, his eyes filled with mockery.

As time passed, the Tidal Azure Wave Formation grew ever more powerful; the abundant Water Spiritual Qi around them continuously poured into the formation, and the strange beasts and weapon‑shaped constructs it condensed only grew larger.

A pressure descended from the heavens that even made Sha Hu's face change dramatically.

Yang Kai, however, still showed no intention of moving; he stood in place at leisure, as if savoring the very power of the Tidal Azure Wave Formation.

After at least half a cup of tea, the formation's power had been raised to its utmost peak.

A roar like a tsunami sounded at their ears, unsettling the mind. Looking out, the sky was filled with countless strange beasts and blades formed from Water Spiritual Qi, like predators glaring hungrily at Yang Kai, waiting for the moment to shred him to pieces.

A look of relief appeared on Jiang Huai'an's face—he understood clearly. Even if Yang Kai possessed peerless ability, there was no way he could escape the Tidal Azure Wave Formation now.

This massive formation had been modified and strengthened by countless capable men and extraordinary talents in the Sea Hall; it was a backing sufficient to withstand the destruction of an entire clan.

“Sect Master Yang, for the sake of Senior Uncle Sha’s hospitality, if you surrender quietly, this Hall Master may consider showing leniency. How about it?” Jiang Huai’an spoke unhurriedly, his tone calm and composed, as though he already had Yang Kai completely in his grasp.

"No," Yang Kai shook his head. Smiling at Jiang Huai'an, he said, "I came with sincerity and did not expect such treatment. To be honest, your Sea Hall has angered this Sect Master. If Elder Sha were not here, this Sect Master would have considered having your Sea Hall removed from Dark Star, but since the Sea Hall is Elder Sha's sect, I cannot go too far."

“Just you? And you think you can erase my Sea Hall from the Dark Star? Where did you get such arrogance?” Jiang Huai’an roared furiously. “What ability do you have?”

Yang Kai let out a small chuckle and, without much motion, looked at Jiang Huai'an and softly mouthed a single word.

"Break!"

As the word fell, the Tidal Azure Wave Formation, which had been charged to its limit, suddenly vibrated and trembled; the countless strange beasts and blades floating in midair seemed to gain a will of their own, obeyed Yang Kai's command, and with a flurry of dense cracking sounds, all burst apart.

Even the bright luminous curtain that enveloped the entire Black Reef Island shattered at that moment.

The Sea Hall's sect‑sealing array was broken in an instant!

It was as if the single word Yang Kai had uttered possessed supreme power, forcing the Spiritual Qi of heaven and earth to obey his instruction.

Sha Hu stood agape, deeply shocked, and looked at Yang Kai with a bewildered expression as if he had only just met him that day.

Jiang Huai'an froze in place as well; he glanced at Yang Kai and then around, utterly unable to believe that the Tidal Azure Wave Formation had been completely undone by a single word.

The third Hall Master, Qi Yunhai, was even more dumbstruck, his body trembling slightly.

The remaining Sea Hall experts all cried out in disbelief.

"What's going on?" After a long while, Jiang Huai'an finally reacted and shouted at Qi Yunhai, "Where are the disciples who maintain the formation? Why did they stop the array?"

He had assumed the array had been halted by the disciples themselves, not by any action taken by Yang Kai.

Qi Yunhai, bewildered, hurriedly took out his Transmission Compass and poured his Divine Sense into it to contact the disciples who had been overseeing the Tidal Azure Wave Formation. After a moment, his face turned pale as he said, "Hall Master, it was not that the disciples stopped the array—they cannot activate the great formation."

"How is that possible?" Jiang Huai'an's eyes trembled as he looked at Yang Kai in terror.

Yang Kai grinned broadly. "Don't waste your effort. The Spiritual Qi of the heaven and earth within a thousand li around here is under my control. Without my permission, your array is merely decoration."

"Nonsense!" Jiang Huai'an shouted. "Even if you were at the Void King Realm, you could not possibly control such a vast range of Spiritual Qi—do you think this Hall Master is a fool?"

Yang Kai chuckled softly and slowly raised both hands into the air.

His movements were not swift but leisurely; yet as his hands rose, the sea near Black Reef Island boiled as though brought to a boil, churning violently as massive bubbles surged up from beneath the surface.

One whirlpool after another formed near Black Reef Island, spinning crazily.

Boom, boom, boom...

Thick columns of water suddenly shot up from those whirlpools; each column was dozens of zhang across, surging toward the heavens and tearing holes through the clouds.

The sky shook and the earth trembled; everyone staggered and could hardly stand.

The sea surface around Black Reef Island seemed to drop by several inches.

The columns that shot into the sky then returned violently and transformed into blue water‑dragons; their immense, ferocious heads had lifelike features, and even their bodies, formed from the water columns, bore scale‑like patterns.

In the blink of an eye, hundreds of water‑dragons formed around Black Reef Island, each composed purely of gathered seawater. They shook head and tail and rushed toward the island, then halted in unison when only dozens of zhang from it remained, staring down.

In an instant, Black Reef Island was completely surrounded by these hundreds of water‑dragons, packed so tightly there was not a gap; each dragon stretched a thousand zhang long and measured dozens of zhang in girth, each exuding a crushing, annihilating pressure.

It was easy to imagine that when those hundreds of water‑dragons swept down, Black Reef Island would be reduced to ruins in an extremely short time.

And Yang Kai had accomplished all this merely by lifting his arms slightly—there was no sign he had used Saint Yuan, nor had he exerted any obvious force.

A clamor rose from the island. Surrounded by so many water‑dragons, the Sea Hall disciples were naturally terrified; not knowing what had occurred, they either collapsed to the ground or fled desperately—the scene was utter chaos.

Jiang Huai'an could no longer suppress the terror in his heart; he trembled violently and looked at Yang Kai like a monster, unable to fathom how Yang Kai could do such a thing.

No one now doubted that Yang Kai had the power to have the Sea Hall removed from Dark Star—this spectacle was proof enough.

"Impossible—this Hall Master absolutely will not believe it; this is merely an illusion!" Jiang Huai'an still refused to give up, suddenly brightening as he seized upon a convenient explanation and looked at Yang Kai, "So Sect Master Yang has cultivated profound illusions; this Hall Master nearly fell for it."

"Stubborn fool!" Yang Kai snorted coldly. With a thought, a water‑dragon dove down and charged at Jiang Huai'an.

Midair, the enormous water‑dragon twisted and transformed into a water arrow only three zhang long, and in an instant it slammed into Jiang Huai'an's face.

Jiang Huai'an roared as Saint Yuan surged from his body; he struck the void in rapid succession and formed shield‑like secret techniques that congealed before him.

All was in vain. Where the water arrow passed, the shields exploded one after another without even a hint of stopping.

Only then did Jiang Huai'an turn pale with alarm, realizing that what he faced was no illusion but a real attack.

By the time he tried to dodge, it was already too late.

The water arrow pierced through his body, drawing a spray of blood that shot out from his back.

Jiang Huai'an's eyes widened as he fell backward.

But because Sha Hu had earlier pleaded for leniency, Yang Kai did not finish him off. Even so, this strike had nearly taken most of Jiang Huai'an's life; without careful treatment he would certainly suffer a great fall in cultivation.

“With a single thought, seas turn into mulberry fields; with a single thought, mountains shift and peaks are moved… Yang Kai, could it be that you’ve refined the Dark Star’s Origin?” Sha Hu asked, his voice trembling, yet a brilliant light flickered within his eyes.

"What?" Qi Yunhai's face changed greatly as he stared at Yang Kai in astonishment.

To refine a Star's Stellar Origin was something only spoken of in legends; once one refined a Star's Stellar Origin, one became that Cultivation Star's Star Lord and could control everything.

Qi Yunhai instinctively refused to believe such an absurd notion, for refining a Stellar Origin required an unimaginably powerful cultivation as its foundation — according to legend, one needed to reach the Third Stage of the Void King Realm!

Though there were rare cases where those at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm, through extraordinary fortune, refined a Stellar Origin and rose to become a Star Lord.

But such matters were exceedingly remote, especially for a martial artist on Dark Star.

Yang Kai was only a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm—how could he possibly have refined a Stellar Origin?

Yet if it was not for that cause, how else could one explain what they had witnessed?

Ordinary Void King Realm masters likely could not summon such a spectacle. Only a Star Lord who commanded a Cultivation Star could freely manipulate Spiritual Qi and gather seas into dragons.

"Elder Sha's sight is keen; I was merely fortunate," Yang Kai smiled faintly, offering no denial.

Deep within, Qi Yunhai could not help but feel ashamed.

He suddenly realized that by following Jiang Huai’an, he had done something he would regret for the rest of his life.

On Dark Star, was there anything more foolish than turning against the Star Lord of that very star?

"So it is!" Sha Hu breathed out, sighing in grief and saying, "Foolish, foolish indeed!"

He was clearly reproaching Jiang Huai'an for his short‑sightedness. Although Sha Hu and Yang Kai had been on good terms before, after this incident Yang Kai's impression of the Sea Hall would certainly be poor, which would be extremely detrimental to the Sea Hall's future development.
