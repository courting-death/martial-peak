## Chapter 866 — Blood Escape

The duel between Xueli and Li Rong had reached almost the pinnacle of the world’s contests; Zhang Ao, Cao Guan, and the others dared not interfere recklessly given their strength.

So they surged forward at once, intending to relieve Yu Mo.

Between Poxuan Palace and the War Soul Hall there were four Saint Realm masters; Zhang Ao had even reached the Second Stage of the Saint Realm, his prowess considerable. Once he joined the fray, he immediately suppressed the arrogance of the two new commanders, Yinya and Xueji.

Outnumbering them five to two, even if Yinya and Xueji unleashed Demon God Transformation, the situation would be perilous for them.

“Saint Lord, shall we assist?” Wu Jie’s eyelids twitched as he couldn’t help asking.

“No need.” Yang Kai shook his head; at this scale Wu Jie couldn’t be of much help. Yang Kai had intended to act, but after sensing the situation he realized it was unnecessary.

Far to the left and right, two figures were racing over at high speed.

They were the recently broken-through commanders Han Fei and Hua Mo.

The former emanated an icy chill while the latter radiated a mighty presence. Even before they arrived, a terrifying pressure descended. Yinya and Xueji, who had been in difficulty, brightened at once and attacked all the more fiercely.

The white snowy peaks were almost entirely shrouded in pitch-black Demon Yuan, making the world there seem cloaked in darkness.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh...

Countless ice shards loaded with destructive power shot through the sky, striking at Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and their group; danger arrived and they shivered, scrambling to evade. But from deep beneath the snow mountain, innumerable strange black hands thrust up and groped for them.

At the same time, like a phantom, Hua Mo shot up from below; exquisite ripples of energy burst from his hands, slamming down upon the enemy positions.

Caught unawares, Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and the others fared badly. Apart from Zhang Ao—whose superior strength kept him safe—all the other Saint Realm cultivators were struck bloody and forced back, nearly dying on the spot.

“They’re finished!” Yang Kai snorted coldly. He stopped paying attention to that fight and instead fixed his gaze higher up in the sky.

There, the battle between Li Rong and Xueli had reached white-hot intensity. Xueli had suffered a small setback earlier in a moment of alarm, but after steadying herself she no longer lagged behind.

The two beautiful women seemed perfectly matched, locked in a contest without clear advantage.

Strange waves of energy and soul fluctuations washed outward in circles; those ripples were so subtle and profound that everything they passed through seemed to be stirred.

Under those waves, Yang Kai felt an omen of the world’s collapse.

Alarmed, he knew this was the effect top-tier experts produced during combat, and watched more intently, hoping to glean something useful.

To his disappointment, Xueli no longer displayed her former dominance. When facing Li Rong she seemed constrained, as if holding something back.

When she sensed Han Fei and Hua Mo arriving, she lost almost all desire to continue the fight.

Under the cold moon, the two figures touched and then separated as quickly as they met.

Standing a hundred zhang apart, the two beauties regarded each other gravely. Li Rong’s eyes flashed with murderous intent and hatred, while Xueli’s were full of caution and hesitation.

The Ancient Demon Clan was a legend among the demons.

Li Rong’s mere Second Stage of the Saint Realm could stand toe-to-toe with one of their Demon Generals. If she reached the Third Stage, even today’s Demon Lord might not be her match!

Realizing this, Xueli’s heart wavered; she wondered whether she should continue defying the leader of that legendary clan, and silently regretted having rashly slain the Coffin-Bearer earlier.

Had that not happened, they could have all sat down and talked—after all, they were of the same demon kind; there was no need to slaughter each other before humans and make fools of themselves.

But when she met Li Rong’s gaze she knew that grudge could not be resolved; it had reached the point of life-and-death vengeance!

Yinya ground his teeth as Xueli hissed, “Ancient Demon Clan... today I have seen enough... the Demon Lord will come for you—I hope you can still be as arrogant then!”

As she spoke her body writhed like a snake, bones cracking out of alignment; a strange, bloody scent suddenly exuded from Xueli’s body.

Li Rong’s expression changed; by the time she realized what Xueli intended it was too late to stop her.

Thud...

A muffled sound rang out as Demon General Xueli burst into a cloud of blood midair, seemingly reduced to no bones or remains.

Yang Kai and Wu Jie, watching below, were dumbfounded; they could not have imagined Xueli would be so resolute, and she did not appear to be at a total dead end.

Yet Yang Kai was left with a vague, uneasy feeling—he doubted Xueli could have truly died so simply.

“Blood Escape?” Li Rong ground her teeth and glared at the burst blood-cloud. She waved her hand and a surging, concentrated force swept over it, but the blood mist dissipated into the heavens and earth, leaving her grasping at nothing.

At the same time, beside Yu Mo—who was being driven into a panic by Han Fei and badly wounded—strange droplets of blood emitting a faint golden light suddenly appeared.

Those drops wrapped around Yu Mo and in a flash transformed into a beam of bloodlight that fled off into the distance.

Li Rong turned sharply, her face dark as she stared in that direction, her teeth gnashing in fury, helpless to act.

She hadn’t expected Xueli to use such a move. Although it consumed tremendous Yuan Qi, it was perfect for escape; once used Li Rong could not stop it.

For this was a divine technique of the Great Demon God!

It seemed that while refining the Demon God Golden Blood she had obtained by chance, Xueli had the good fortune to comprehend some mysteries belonging to the Great Demon God.

Yet just as everyone thought Xueli had successfully fled, tens of li away a filament of golden light suddenly blossomed.

In the sky a golden chain flashed, being swung by an invisible massive hand, clattering as it sliced through the air.

The golden chain stretched on and on like a river of gold tearing the heavens, emitting the purest Yang attribute.

The aura reached here and all the Ancient Demon Clan members frowned, showing clear discomfort.

“Locking Demon Chain?” Yang Kai cried out in surprise.

He recognized the chain at a glance—the very Secret Treasure he had obtained from the Dragon Confinement Ravine beneath Lingxiao Pavilion. With that chain Yang Kai had slain a remnant Soul Incarnation of Demon General Meng Ge and killed the Evil Lord Yang Bai of Cangyun Evil Land.

After coming to the Tongxuan Continent and joining Tianxiao Sect, Yang Kai returned the Locking Demon Chain to its rightful owner.

It should now be in Chu Lingxiao’s hands.

“Demoness, do you think humankind has no defenders? This is not a place where you may come and go as you please!” a bell-like, thunderous roar suddenly boomed across the heavens.

The voice seemed to contain boundless mesmerizing power; it shook the ears and unsettled the mind.

Everyone who heard it felt their qi and blood surge, faces flushing.

As the voice sounded, the Locking Demon Chain carried an irresistible momentum and lashed like a long whip toward a point in space.

Moments later, Xueli’s scream sounded in everyone’s ears.

A great burst of bloodlight swelled; within that crimson glare Xueli’s disordered figure flickered, escaping at even faster speed.

Yang Kai’s expression grew strange.

He felt that the owner of that voice was likely Chu Lingxiao, the sect founder of Tianxiao Sect!

“Master!” Li Rong hurriedly flew to Yang Kai’s side, her pretty face grave. She said in a low voice, “That person is very powerful, and his Secret Treasure seems to be particularly oppressive to my demon kin... If anything happens later, Master, you must distance yourself from my clan and stay uninvolved. I will lead my people to hide in these snow mountains for a while.”

Yang Kai glanced at her and chuckled hoarsely: “No need. I’ll handle this.”

Li Rong stared at him in surprise but obediently nodded without saying more.

“Xueli fled because she sensed that man’s aura, right?” Yang Kai mused.

“Probably.” Li Rong nodded. “She couldn’t defeat me alone; if another arrived... she wouldn’t be able to leave.”

“No wonder.” Yang Kai felt relieved.

No wonder she suddenly used that strange technique and escaped while evenly matched with Li Rong—she must have detected something.

This woman had a keen sense, indeed.

“By the way, you mentioned Blood Escape just now—are you familiar with the method she used?” Yang Kai frowned.

“If I’m not mistaken, it’s a divine technique of the Great Demon God,” Li Rong nodded lightly. “Master needn’t envy her; when the Demon God Golden Blood in your body thickens to a certain degree, you will come to understand it naturally.”

“I’m not jealous, just asking casually,” Yang Kai chuckled.

The Demon God’s divine techniques... he had refined a drop of Demon God Golden Blood and gained a Soul Incarnation technique. That Soul Incarnation still lay dormant, nurturing itself, waiting for the day it could play its part.

He hadn’t expected Xueli to have also comprehended a Great Demon God technique.

After Xueli fled, Zhang Ao, Cao Guan and the others dared not resist any longer; they gathered together, looking at Han Fei and the others who had besieged them with mixed expressions.

They had followed Xueli into these Endless Snow Mountains thinking they had found a powerful patron and would no longer fear the Nine Heavens Sacred Land’s retaliation, but now events had gone so far.

Last time they allied to attack the Nine Heavens Sacred Land, Yang Kai had brought the Great Yao Lord as aid and had beaten them to the ground.

This time the man had gone even further, and had somehow gathered these demon kin; even a demon general was driven off and they acted like lunatics, utterly irrational.

In that moment Zhang Ao and Cao Guan felt some respect for Wu Jie; in a way Wu Jie did have foresight they lacked.

Though fearful, Zhang Ao’s expression remained unchanged as he shouted, “Our human experts will arrive soon—demon kin, if you do not flee now, when will you?”
