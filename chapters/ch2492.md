## Chapter 2492 — Just Who Is This Mysterious Expert

Zhang Ruoxi stood dazed for a while before realizing the old swindler was calling her. With so many eyes on her, she couldn’t help but feel timid, her face growing even paler as the power surging within her delicate body became more and more violent with each passing moment.

She turned her head and looked at Yang Kai with a questioning gaze.

Yang Kai asked in a deep voice, "Old man, you’re not joking, are you?"

The old swindler replied solemnly, "How could I joke about something like this?"

"Then explain it to me. How can Ruoxi help you seal the Divine Spirit’s Spirit Essence?"

It wasn’t just Yang Kai who was confused—everyone was. After all, Zhang Ruoxi didn’t look remarkable at all, and her cultivation was only at the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. With so many Emperors present, the old swindler could have asked anyone for help, so why her?

Unexpectedly, the old swindler shook his head and said, "I can’t say, I can’t say. If you trust me, let her come over. If you don’t, there’s nothing I can do."

Yang Kai said sternly, "How am I supposed to trust you if you don’t explain?"

The old man spread his hands and said, "Then there’s nothing to be done. If her seal fully unravels, she might go on a killing spree in this Shattered Star Sea, and only then will the Divine Spirit’s Spirit Essence fall back into slumber. When that happens, you’ll all have to fend for yourselves."

Yang Kai’s face darkened. The old man was being deliberately mysterious, yet there was nothing he could do about it. The feeling of helplessness was truly infuriating.

Just then, Zhang Ruoxi suddenly said, "Sir, if I can help calm Xiaoqi, I’m willing to try!"

"But your own condition right now…" Yang Kai frowned.

He didn’t know what was wrong with Zhang Ruoxi either. She seemed very uneasy, and the aura within her body had become strange. Although her situation wasn’t as severe as Mo Xiaoqi’s, it was still worrisome.

“I’ll be fine.” Zhang Ruoxi pressed her lips together and said softly, “Sir, please let me try.”

The old swindler urged him on. “If you hesitate any longer, once her seal is fully undone, there will be no turning things around. And… let me tell you something else—at the root of it, the conditions of those two girls are linked. Resolve the problem of the seal, and the other one’s trouble will be resolved as well.”

Yang Kai looked utterly confused, but the old swindler’s sincere expression made him believe a little. He asked in a deep voice, "Will your method harm Ruoxi?"

"No harm to her life. I just need a single drop of her Essence-Blood!"

"Essence-Blood…" Yang Kai was startled, feeling more and more that the old swindler wasn’t just spouting nonsense. Zhang Ruoxi possessed a unique bloodline power, though Yang Kai had never figured out exactly what it was. Now that the old swindler wanted a drop of her Essence-Blood, it was clear he knew her bloodline was extraordinary. Perhaps something hidden within it could help him seal the Divine Spirit’s Spirit Essence.

He could actually see that much?

"Fine, I agree!" Yang Kai replied in a deep voice, taking Zhang Ruoxi and flying over to the old swindler.

Soon, the two of them arrived before the old swindler.

The old man gave Zhang Ruoxi a gentle smile and said kindly, "Relax, little girl. You won’t be hurt."

Zhang Ruoxi nodded slightly and took a deep breath, readying herself.

Suddenly, the old man glanced at Zhang Ruoxi again in surprise and said, "Your clothes… not bad. Where did you get them?"

At these words, Yang Kai’s heart skipped a beat.

Because beneath Zhang Ruoxi’s outer garment, she was wearing a defensive Imperial Treasure—the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress!

This defensive Imperial Treasure was extremely valuable and boasted astonishing protection. Ever since Zhang Ruoxi obtained it, she had always worn it close to her body.

The old man’s comment about her clothes clearly wasn’t about her outerwear, but the Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress hidden underneath.

What’s with this old man? He could even see that? Yang Kai couldn’t help but become wary.

Zhang Ruoxi, however, was unguarded and simply replied, "A friend gave it to me."

"A friend…" The old man’s mouth twitched, then he chuckled, "If you see that friend again, give him my regards. Tell him I miss him!"

Zhang Ruoxi asked in surprise, "Senior, you know him?"

"It’s been a long time," the old man answered kindly.

The two of them chatted back and forth, while Yang Kai’s heart was in turmoil, his eyes wide as if he’d seen a ghost in broad daylight.

In that moment, Yang Kai realized that this old man was far from the eccentric, rambling figure he appeared to be on the surface. Instead, he seemed unfathomably deep, his true abilities hidden beneath layers of mystery.

After all, Zhang Ruoxi’s Phoenix-Colored Cloud Dress was obtained from the Four Seasons Land, and according to her, the one who gave her this Imperial Treasure was the Ancient Divine Spirit Qiong Qi!

Qiong Qi was said to be the mount of the Great Emperor of Time. After the Great Emperor of Time fell, Qiong Qi remained in the Four Seasons Land, slumbering there until the Time Temple appeared. After that, Qiong Qi left the Four Seasons Land, and no one knew where he went.

Qiong Qi was an ancient ferocious beast, notorious for slaughter. When he emerged from the Four Seasons Land, he startled Gao Xueting and the others guarding the exit. Fortunately, Qiong Qi had no intention to harm anyone, or else Gao Xueting and the others would have surely died.

But now, the old man’s words implied that he actually knew Qiong Qi.

Just who is this old man! Yang Kai had always found him strange, but now he was even more shrouded in mystery.

Why would such an extraordinary person only have the cultivation of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm?

"Senior, how should I address you?" Zhang Ruoxi seemed to get along well with the old man, and her previously anxious mood gradually relaxed.

Yang Kai also perked up his ears, listening intently.

The old man uttered a few words.

Yang Kai looked completely lost—he hadn’t caught what the old man said at all.

Zhang Ruoxi nodded and said, "I’ve remembered, Senior. If I see him again, I’ll pass on your message. But I don’t know where he’s gone—after giving me this dress, he disappeared."

As she spoke, Zhang Ruoxi suddenly swayed and nearly collapsed.

Fortunately, Yang Kai reacted quickly and caught her.

"Alright, the Essence-Blood has been taken. Rest for a bit," the old man said with a smile.

Only then did Yang Kai notice a drop of bright red blood floating above the old man’s fingertip. The blood seemed almost alive, dancing restlessly at his fingertip, and within it swirled an extremely strange aura.

Yang Kai had no idea when the old man had taken the Essence-Blood.

The reason Zhang Ruoxi suddenly staggered was clearly because she’d lost a bit of vitality. But a single drop of Essence-Blood was no big deal—she’d recover after some rest.

With the Essence-Blood in hand, the old man’s expression turned extremely serious. His Origin Qi surged, wrapping around the Essence-Blood, and with a finger, he pointed at Mo Xiaoqi’s forehead, his movements as swift as lightning.

Hiss hiss…

The Illusory Heaven Butterfly’s Spirit Essence suddenly became extremely restless, as if it had encountered its nemesis. It flapped its wings furiously, sending out waves of illusionary power.

Yang Kai had suffered greatly from these illusions before and knew how dangerous they were. He was about to retreat when he realized that all the illusionary waves were blocked by Zhang Ruoxi’s Essence-Blood, not causing even the slightest ripple.

Without any resistance, the old man placed the Essence-Blood on Mo Xiaoqi’s forehead.

The Essence-Blood instantly burst apart, forming a crimson mark on Mo Xiaoqi’s forehead before seeping into her body.

As the Essence-Blood disappeared, Mo Xiaoqi’s aura quickly stabilized. The Illusory Heaven Butterfly was drawn into her body by a mysterious force, turning back into a butterfly-shaped mark imprinted on her cheek.

With a soft groan, Mo Xiaoqi collapsed limply, her eyes tightly shut.

Yang Kai quickly reached out with his other hand to support her. Looking closely, he saw that Mo Xiaoqi’s breathing was steady—she had just fainted and was otherwise fine.

This earth-shattering crisis had come out of nowhere and was resolved just as mysteriously, leaving everyone on edge for a long while. Only after it was over did they realize their backs were drenched in cold sweat.

"Sir, I’m so sleepy!" Zhang Ruoxi suddenly said, and just like Mo Xiaoqi, she immediately fainted.

The old man grinned at Yang Kai and teased, “Not bad, not bad, kid. Surrounded by beauties on both sides—truly living the dream! This old man can’t help but envy you.”

Yang Kai’s face darkened. "Old man, isn’t it a bit shameless for someone your age to act like this?"

The old man replied, "I was young once too, it’s nothing to fuss about." As he spoke, he winked and made all sorts of lewd faces at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai said seriously, "Old man, let’s not beat around the bush. I used to think you were a swindler, but now I see you’re truly a hidden expert."

The old man laughed, "I’m just a bit better at trickery than others, that’s all. Don’t mind it."

Yang Kai nodded. "Old man, since you could tell Ruoxi’s Essence-Blood could suppress the Divine Spirit’s Spirit Essence, you must know what kind of bloodline she has. Can you tell me?"

At these words, the old man’s expression turned serious. After pondering for a moment, he said, "That I can’t tell you. When she grows stronger, she’ll figure it out herself. But let me give you a word of advice."

"What is it?"

"Guide her to goodness. If she turns to evil, the Star Realm will fall into chaos!" the old man said solemnly.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes. "Is it really that serious?"

The old man gazed at the sleeping Zhang Ruoxi. Though his eyes appeared clouded, a sharp light suddenly burst from them as he said gravely, “If she were to grow to her limit, the power she could unleash would be even more terrifying than Wu Kuang’s.”

“Wu Kuang? Which Wu Kuang are you talking about?” Yang Kai asked with a frown.

The old man enunciated each word: "Heaven… Devouring… Great… Emperor!"

Gulp…

Yang Kai couldn’t help but swallow, exclaiming, "Old man, you actually know the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s real name?"

If not for the old man mentioning it, Yang Kai would never have known the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s real name. “Heaven Devouring” was merely a title, not his given name. Wu Mengchuan claimed to be his descendant, and Yang Kai had guessed the Emperor’s surname was Wu.

But he never expected to learn the Heaven Devouring Great Emperor’s name from this old man.

How did he know?

Yang Kai asked with difficulty, "Old man, just who are you, really!"
