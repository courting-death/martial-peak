## Chapter 431 — You Can Rest Assured

Huo Xingchen’s voice rang out loud and clear. Who here hadn’t heard of the reckless scoundrel, the notorious young master of Zhongdu?

Hearing him say that, even the two warring sides rolled their eyes. Yang Zhao and Yang Shen grew even darker in expression.

Huo Xingchen stood in the middle of the battlefield like a walking hindrance. Everyone had to carefully avoid attacking near him, and the surging True Essence currents had to steer clear of him as well.

Otherwise, if someone seriously injured this man, with his insolent personality, he would surely seek revenge later. Even with the protection of Yang Zhao and Yang Shen, those who harmed him would scarcely avoid such retribution.

Among all present, only those born from the Eight Great Families had the qualifications to engage him and capture him, but the chaotic battlefield left Yang Zhao and Yang Shen with no courage to personally step in.

Before Huo Xingchen could finish speaking, a Divine Roaming Realm Third Stage cultivator was knocked out of the fighting circle by Qu Gaoyi, only to collide heavily against Huo’s shoulder.

The young master instantly erupted in anger, swinging a loud slap and cursing, “Damn it! I already said I’m Huo Xingchen, and you still can’t keep your eyes open! What if you break me? Can you afford to pay for that?”

The Divine Roaming Realm Third Stage cultivator, already gasping for air after Qu Gaoyi’s assault, with his Qi and blood boiling wildly, was publicly slapped by Huo Xingchen. Unable to vent his rage, he spat a mouthful of fresh blood and collapsed weakly.

He fainted purely from anger and frustration.

“Clumsy fool!” Huo Xingchen snorted disdainfully.

The faces of Yang Zhao and Yang Shen grew even uglier. Huo Xingchen’s behavior was blatantly that of a rogue; none of the young masters from Zhongdu’s Eight Great Families besides him had such shamelessness.

Ye Xinrou of the Ye Family showed a bitter smile on her delicate face, and Qiu Ziru also shook his head in disapproval.

Everyone felt ashamed to be associated with this man.

In contrast, Qiu Yimeng stood nearby, smiling and enjoying the reckless young master’s mischievous display.

Huo Xingchen moved through the chaotic battlefield as if he were walking through an empty realm. Everyone seeing him would scatter to avoid conflict, leaving him bored to no end. Scratching his head, he turned around with a hint of frustration: “Qiu Yimeng, can I go back now? Nobody wants to fight me.”

With the matter put that plainly, who would dare to fight him? After all, he was the only heir of the Huo Family, unlike others who had multiple successors.

“Just stand there and do nothing!” Qiu Yimeng smiled calmly. She suddenly realized that this rogue young master actually served a useful purpose.

“Seriously?” Huo Xingchen’s face immediately twisted.

Outside the circle, Ye Xinrou’s beautiful eyes flicked around and softly said, “Second Young Master, allow me to capture him.”

Though Ye Xinrou wasn’t as famous as Qiu Yimeng, she was still one of Zhongdu’s finest from the younger generation. Many even called them the Two Blossoms of Zhongdu.

Her own strength was not weak; armed with a variety of exquisite treasures, she was capable of contending with most Divine Roaming Realm First Stage martial artists.

She was confident in her ability to capture Huo Xingchen. Just because others feared the young master didn’t mean those from the Eight Great Families did.

Yang Zhao shook his head upon hearing this, a heavy expression on his face: “You’re no match for him.”

Ye Xinrou was taken aback, then smiled bitterly: “Second Young Master, you’re underestimating me. Although I appear gentle, I do have some skill.”

Yang Zhao smiled meaningfully: “I am well aware of your abilities and have not underestimated you. It is only you who underestimates this Huo young master.”

Ye Xinrou looked surprised and hesitated: “You mean he…”

Yang Zhao chuckled: “Before the Yang Family’s descendants returned to Zhongdu, the three most famous young talents were known to be the top figures of the new generation, with Huo Xingchen ranking third. Do you think his fame comes solely from being a rakish and lecherous scoundrel? Xinrou, you have underestimated the foundation of the Huo Family.”

Ye Xinrou’s expression sobered before she nodded lightly: “Second Young Master is right. Perhaps it is because I dislike him that I undervalued him.”

As they spoke, beside them, Xiang Chu subtly signaled to a Divine Roaming Realm expert below.

That expert understood silently and quietly slipped away from the fight against Qu Gaoyi, deliberately approaching Xiang Tianxiao, who was engaged in battle against a True Essence Realm Peak martial artist.

The battlefield was chaotic; no one paid attention to such a minor detail—including Xiang Tianxiao himself, who remained completely unaware.

Moments later, the Divine Roaming Realm expert neared Xiang Tianxiao, his eyes flashing with cold killing intent as he unleashed an invisible Divine Sense attack.

At that moment, Huo Xingchen unexpectedly stumbled and moved a few steps to the left.

Those critical steps placed him directly between Xiang Tianxiao and the incoming assault.

The Divine Sense swept into Huo Xingchen’s mind with a violent explosion.

A ring of azure light shimmered around him—his Divinely Soul Treasure, a soul artifact he carried, activated and provided a defensive shield.

Catching sight of this blue glow, Huo Xingchen glanced suspiciously to the sides, locking eyes with the attacking Divine Roaming Realm expert.

Realizing the situation, Huo Xingchen grinned wickedly: “Damn it, you dared to use soul arts against me? You’ve got guts. Luckily, I carry a Divine Soul Treasure; otherwise, you would have succeeded!”

The attacker had not expected such a turn of events and was instantly stunned as his soul suffered a backlash.

Just earlier, someone accidentally bumped into Huo Xingchen and was publicly slapped. Now, daring to use soul techniques against him? What fate could possibly await him?

Cold sweat trickled down his forehead as he hurriedly raised his hands in a plea: “Young Master Huo, it was unintentional.”

Huo Xingchen’s face twisted in fury, teeth clenched: “Unintentional? Could it be done without intention?”

Before he finished speaking, he swung a slap.

The expert instinctively raised his arm to block but quickly realized the gravity of the situation, his expression turning wildly contorted.

“I… Young Master Huo, please be magnanimous and don’t make this personal.”

“No need for words,” Huo Xingchen sneered maliciously. “You’re from the Xiang Family, right? Today I won’t kill you, but from now on call yourself Xiang Xingchen and stand right there without moving.”

The man dared not move, wishing he could faint on the spot. If he hadn’t instinctively blocked that slap to let Huo Xingchen vent, his fate would have been even worse.

Bitterness weighed heavily on him—like swallowing a bitter herb.

Huo Xingchen turned and searched the battlefield. Somehow, he retrieved a sharp weapon from a corpse. He brandished it a few times before strolling back and standing before the expert, eyes sharp and cold.

“You tell me—should I chop you down blow by blow, or cut you down with a single strike?”

Though the expert was strong, he couldn’t help but tremble in dread. He quickly looked to Xiang Chu, silently begging for help.

Xiang Chu could only smile wryly. Though he was the future head of the Xiang Family, a first-rate force, it was no match for the Huo Family. He dared not provoke Huo Xingchen, this rogue scoundrel.

Seeing Xiang Chu’s resigned smile, the expert knew his fate was sealed.

Gritting his teeth, he said, “Young Master Huo, do as you will.”

“Ha! Quite the backbone,” Huo Xingchen said, pleasantly surprised, not expecting him to resist at all.

No sooner had he spoken than a cold glint flashed from the weapon in his hand.

With a muffled grunt, the expert’s arm was severed at the shoulder, blood spurting like a fountain.

“Hmph, you had some backbone, so I had to cripple you.”

Pain searing, the expert dared not resist, circulating True Essence to slow the blood loss, his face pale as he gritted his teeth: “Thank you, Young Master Huo, for sparing my life.”

Huo Xingchen casually said, “People from the Xiang Family should have an arm cut off. The same goes for that Nan Family. If you all don’t hurry up and leave the succession war, I’ll just cut off every single arm you have. Then you can rename yourselves the One-Armed Xiang Family and One-Armed Nan Family! Wahahaha!”

His reckless laugh echoed, deepening the expressions of Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng—they both turned ashen.

Huo Xingchen’s words were a direct insult, mocking the four experts from the Xiang and Nan families who had been forced by Yang Kai to amputate their arms.

This was an unbearable humiliation for the two families.

Neither Xiang Chu nor Nan Sheng could help but clench their fists tightly. They had followed Yang Zhao to confront Yang Kai, but after such a long fight, Yang Kai had yet to show himself. Instead, their camp was completely disrupted by Huo Xingchen’s rogue antics, and a valuable expert had a limb severed.

This stung worse than being publicly humiliated.

“Second Young Master, please help us seek justice!” Xiang Chu gritted his teeth and whispered to Yang Zhao, his tone full of deep resentment.

He was truly enraged.

Yang Zhao furrowed his brow. Honestly, he had no desire to get involved in the fray below. Qu Gaoyi was still frantically attacking, the surging energy making every corner of the battlefield unsafe. Besides, Yang Kai remained hidden, leaving Yang Zhao uncertain about his younger brother’s plans.

But the Xiang and Nan families were significant allies; failure to show support now would be disheartening.

After some thought, Yang Zhao said, “Very well, I shall personally deal with him.”

Upon hearing this, both Xiang Chu and Nan Sheng brightened.

The next moment, Yang Zhao and his Blood Servant lightly leapt into the battlefield.

Seeing Yang Zhao himself enter, Huo Xingchen immediately toned down his unruly demeanor and grew serious, saying, “Second Young Master, how refined you are.”

Yang Zhao smiled lightly: “Since no one dares to face you, I shall accompany you.”

Huo Xingchen sighed wryly, “Well, this is the end for me, isn’t it?”

He looked back at Qiu Yimeng: “Beauty, try to save me, or Second Young Master will capture me. I want Yang Kai to lose, but I don’t want to be caught—that would be so humiliating.”

Qiu Yimeng turned gracefully and, surrounded by a radiant light, settled herself in a grand chair with a smile: “It’s fine. One more or less here makes no difference. You can rest assured.”

“Why are you so heartless?”

“The most brutal of women’s hearts. After all, Huo Xingchen, the notorious Zhongdu wolf who has traversed countless flower beds, should know that well,” Qiu Yimeng said with a serpent’s smile.

Huo Xingchen was instantly speechless.
