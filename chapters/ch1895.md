## Chapter 1895 — Angry Xue Yue

Before Shen Tu's palace on Shuiyue Star, a vast plaza waited beneath the sky as an Origin-Grade, Upper-Level warship descended slowly and returned safely to port.

Below, many warriors who had already heard the news stood in waiting to greet them.

When the hatch opened and Shen Tu stepped out, those below shouted in unison, “We respectfully welcome the Second Young Master! Second Young Master, you’ve had a hard journey!”

Shen Tu wore a faint smile and offered a brief response.

Those waiting below to receive him were all his trusted subordinates, so there was no need for formality; among them were numerous Origin Returning Realm cultivators, yet not a single one reached the Void King Realm.

When they saw Li Nuo and Chun Yi, the faces of these warriors lit with delight, clearly already acquainted, but when Yang Kai appeared they showed puzzled suspicion, wondering what kind of person Yang Kai was to be riding the same warship as Shen Tu.

A few of them thought Yang Kai looked familiar, as if resembling someone they had seen decades ago, but upon sensing Yang Kai’s formidable cultivation they dared not fully believe it, and privately felt a chill of doubt.

Shen Tu offered no explanation, only ordering arrangements for the lodging of Li Nuo, Chun Yi and the Commerce Guild members; he then personally led Yang Kai to the chamber Yang Kai had once stayed in decades before.

"Brother Yang, rest here for a few days. Allow me to first return and report to my father what happened on this trip, then we shall speak of other matters."

"Go on, tend to your affairs; don’t worry about me." Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Shen Tu nodded and strode out.

For the next seven or eight days Yang Kai remained within Shen Tu’s palace, waiting for news.

He had come to the Hengluo Commerce Guild partly to obtain its Star Emperor Token — to gather a total of eight — and partly to recruit Chairman Ai Ou into their cause.

Chairman Ai Ou had long since risen to the Second Stage of the Void King Realm and was among the top of that rank, surely not far from the Third Stage of the Void King Realm.

Yang Kai believed Ai Ou could make a breakthrough within ten years.

If Chairman Ai Ou agreed to open the path to the Star Realm with them, one fewer person would be required.

Shen Tu’s report, Yang Kai trusted, would pique Chairman Ai Ou’s interest.

After all, Yang Kai had made such a commotion on Purple Star; Ai Ou would hardly be displeased. The Hengluo Commerce Guild and the Purple Star Sword Alliance were both among the Star Domain’s three greatest powers. Though they cooperated at times, friction existed between them; if Purple Star were to take a hit, Ai Ou certainly wouldn’t miss the chance to exploit it.

Yang Kai was therefore certain Ai Ou would summon him; if Ai Ou valued the matter enough, he might even come in person.

Then Yang Kai could have a proper conversation with Ai Ou.

Yang Kai had the Star Refining Technique in hand and enjoyed no small favor with Xue Yue and Shen Tu; exchanging a Star Emperor Token should not be difficult. Whether Ai Ou would agree to open the path to the Star Realm alongside him remained uncertain, but one must try.

If the plan succeeded, the ten-year plan would stand a good chance of being realized.

Yang Kai had expected matters to take shape quickly.

Yet after waiting seven or eight days in Shen Tu’s palace there was not the slightest movement.

He was astonished and wondered whether something had gone awry; during those days Shen Tu himself was nowhere to be seen, and the palace cultivators said he had left for Shuitian City and not yet returned.

Shuitian City was the largest city on Shuiyue Star; its role and status were comparable to Purple Star City on Purple Star.

It was where the Hengluo Commerce Guild’s senior powerhouses gathered, the very essence of the entire Guild.

Rumor held that Shuitian City contained the most concentrated Spiritual Qi in the Star Domain; to cultivate there was to advance faster than even the spirit-mountain sacred lands occupied by the great sects and powers.

It was only after seven or eight days that Shen Tu finally appeared in Yang Kai’s chamber, his face utterly dejected.

Seeing his crestfallen expression, Yang Kai’s heart lurched and he exclaimed in surprise, "Brother Shen Tu, what happened? Why are you in such a sorry state?"

"Ah, it’s a long story." Shen Tu sat at the table and poured himself a cup of water, downing it in one. When he finished he looked at Yang Kai with shame and said, "Brother Yang, I know you came to Shuiyue Star to discuss important matters with my father, but… now is likely not the right time."

After all, back in Di Chen Yang Kai had already mentioned exchanging something with Chairman Ai Ou; Shen Tu had not pressed for details but guessed Yang Kai had come to Shuiyue Star with purpose.

Otherwise, why would a Second Stage of the Void King Realm like Yang Kai travel so far unless for something more than catching up?

"Oh?" Yang Kai asked in surprise. "Has something happened to Chairman Ai Ou’s side?"

"Yes." Shen Tu nodded gravely. "Something did occur on my father’s end. I went over there and did not even have the chance to report what I had meant to. If you are not in a hurry, wait a little longer; once this turmoil passes I will recommend you."

Yang Kai nodded resignedly. "Very well, then there is nothing to be done. I am not in a rush; I will wait a while."

Shen Tu grinned, "I knew Brother Yang would not make things difficult for me… Brother Yang…"

Shen Tu had not finished when an angry shout suddenly echoed through the palace: "Shen Tu!"

Hearing that voice, Shen Tu went pale and shuddered as if summoned by a demon, trembling all over.

Yang Kai paused, then, with an odd expression, released Divine Sense to probe briefly, then smiled faintly.

Shen Tu looked utterly flustered, patting his head as he said, "Oh no, oh no — I got so wrapped up explaining things to you I forgot my Third Brother's still outside waiting. Say, Brother Yang, do you happen to know my Third Brother? The moment he heard you were at my place he dragged me out without a word, and on the way he gave me a proper beating, scolding me for not telling him such a big matter sooner! That kid's got no respect for his elders. Look, look at this — my eye…"

Shen Tu pushed the bruise near his eye toward Yang Kai for inspection.

Yang Kai’s mouth twitched in amusement.

"If you don’t come out, don’t blame me for tearing down your palace!" Xue Yue’s voice roared, reverberating through the entire palace, throwing the place into utter chaos.

Who in the Hengluo Commerce Guild did not know Xue Yue’s great name? He was the Guild’s chosen successor.

To incur his wrath was to invite universal dread.

Shen Tu wailed, "Brother Yang, come with me quickly; this brat has lost his mind. He’s only been to my palace fewer than three times his whole life, and of all times he chooses now to come. Don’t worry — whatever grievances you and he have, I’ll mediate. If he dares trouble you I’ll… I’ll… I’ll take you and run."

Shen Tu tried to sound fierce, but in the end lacked the courage.

Yang Kai stifled a laugh, thinking Shen Tu must have been bullied by Xue Yue so often he’d learned to take it and never resist.

"Relax. I do know the Third Young Master Xue Yue though we have no enmity. I won’t let her tear down your palace." Yang Kai cleared his throat lightly.

Shen Tu finally breathed a sigh of relief.

The two of them walked, one after the other, toward a certain great hall.

In the hall, Xue Yue stood in a fury so fierce her handsome, androgynous face seemed to drip with it; her Saint Yuan trembled on the verge of eruption, poised to explode at any moment.

She was thoroughly enraged.

Not only was Shen Tu to blame for not telling her sooner that Yang Kai had arrived on Shuiyue Star, she was even angrier that Yang Kai had come without first paying her a visit.

Could that scoundrel not understand how her days had been spent in anxiety?

Last time, while waiting outside the Floating Continent for half a year without a trace of Yang Kai, she and Ni Guang had been forced to leave first; she had fretted ceaselessly for Yang Kai’s safety.

Although Ni Guang had sworn that with the Ghost Ancestor present Yang Kai’s life would be safe, Xue Yue could not be reassured.

After returning to Shuiyue Star she repeatedly sent people to search but found nothing.

So when she idly learned today that Shen Tu had brought a friend named Yang Kai to Shuiyue Star…

After questioning repeatedly she confirmed that this Yang Kai was the very one she had worried about day and night.

Rage made her feel as if her liver ached.

Men truly were worthless; they did not care about others’ worries. When she saw him she would give him a good beating to vent her anger, Xue Yue vowed inwardly.

Nearby, Li Nuo and Chun Yi had tried to calm her, but their pleading fell silent as both women noticed a wildly complex expression in Xue Yue’s eyes.

It was a mingling of love and hate, blood and tears, joy and expectation, delight and fury, even a trace of nervousness…

That look was clearly one belonging to a woman lost in an emotional whirlpool, utterly unable to pull free — yet it appeared on Xue Yue’s face.

It resembled the face of a lovestruck girl about to see her beloved.

Li Nuo and Chun Yi were astonished; neither understood why such a change of expression could appear on Xue Yue.

Suddenly they recalled a dreadful rumor, and both shivered, staring at the handsome young man before them — whose beauty could enrapture thousands — with hearts heavy and aching.

For the first time the two women felt a spark of displeasure and anger toward Yang Kai.

"Third Brother, what madness is this!" With Yang Kai at his side, Shen Tu’s courage seemed bolstered; he strode into the hall and shouted to take the initiative.

Xue Yue cast a frigid glance; Shen Tu involuntarily shrank his neck and his tone dropped a notch, "Uh… this is not your territory, not your palace — don’t make such a fuss, or ignorant onlookers will think Second Brother bullied you, haha."

Xue Yue ignored him and stared directly at Yang Kai behind Shen Tu, her bright, star-like eyes turning suddenly mournful and plaintive.

Li Nuo and Chun Yi looked from Xue Yue to Yang Kai and in that instant confirmed their earlier suspicions, sighing with regret and anger at the unfairness of fate.
