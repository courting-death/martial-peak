## Chapter 2608 — Striking It Rich

Last time, when saving Gao Xueting, he obtained a Life Origin Fruit in that ancient medicine garden. As long as he could gather the remaining auxiliary materials, Yang Kai would be able to refine a Life Origin Pill, allowing Tian Yan, who was trapped in the Divine Roaming Mirror in the forbidden land of Qingyang Shrine, to construct his physical body.

Although Tian Yan only had a Spirit Body, he was still an expert at the Great Emperor level. If he could use the Life Origin Pill to forge a new body, then the Star Realm would gain another Great Emperor.

The reason Yang Kai put so much effort into this was, first, because Tian Yan was a decent person—back then, in the Divine Roaming Mirror, Tian Yan had taught him a Divine Soul secret technique called the Heaven-Shattering Strike. Second, it was something he had promised long ago. And third, opportunities to earn the favor of a Great Emperor were rare indeed.

As long as he could help Tian Yan build his body, if he ever ran into trouble in the future, wouldn't Tian Yan step forward to help him?

However... refining the Life Origin Pill was extremely difficult, and the required medicinal ingredients were both numerous and rare—eighty-one kinds of auxiliary herbs, each one an Imperial-Grade Spiritual Medicine, all precious and hard to find.

Although Yang Kai had quite a few Spiritual Herbs and miraculous medicines on hand, he could barely scrape together half of what was needed. The other half was simply nowhere to be found.

Now, he could only hope that the three Saint Venerables of the Ancient Land could help him gather the rest. Once the ingredients were assembled, he could begin refining the Life Origin Pill, then return to Qingyang Shrine to find Tian Yan.

Thinking of this, Yang Kai couldn’t help but look forward to it.

A few more days passed. On this day, while Yang Kai was in the midst of alchemy, he suddenly sensed something, looked up, and called out, “Yao’er.”

Ji Yao, who was meditating, hurriedly opened her eyes and respectfully replied, “Disciple is here.”

“We have guests. Go tell them that your master is in seclusion and cannot be disturbed. Mm... accept whatever they’ve brought, and let them know that once my injuries are healed, I’ll leave the Ancient Land on my own.”

“Yes.” Upon hearing this, Ji Yao quickly stood up and went downstairs from the second floor.

Not long after, voices drifted up from below. A moment later, Ji Yao returned, respectfully handing over four Spatial Rings to Yang Kai. “Master, these are the items the three Saint Venerables asked me to deliver to you.”

Yang Kai nodded, reaching out to take the four Spatial Rings.

Casually picking up one, he sensed it briefly and couldn’t help but chuckle, thinking that the three Saint Venerables were quite meticulous in their work.

Each of these four Spatial Rings must contain the belongings of a different Saint Venerable. Fearing Yang Kai wouldn’t be able to tell whose was whose, they had deliberately left their own auras on the rings, just to prevent any mix-ups.

The one in his hand should be Fan Wu’s Spatial Ring. He wondered what exactly had been sent.

Yang Kai looked forward to it, sending his mind into the ring to investigate.

At a glance, he saw two piles of Source Crystals stacked like small mountains—one large, one small. The larger pile was all Middle-Level Source Crystals, while the smaller pile was Upper-Level Source Crystals.

With a quick calculation, Yang Kai couldn’t help but laugh. There were about three billion Middle-Level Source Crystals and as many as fifty million Upper-Level Source Crystals. Such a vast amount of Source Crystals was already a fortune of considerable value.

Even a first-tier Sect would be hard-pressed to produce so much at once. One Upper-Level Source Crystal could be exchanged for a hundred Middle-Level Source Crystals, and one Middle-Level Source Crystal for a hundred Lower-Level Source Crystals.

Fifty million Upper-Level Source Crystals might not sound like much, but if converted, that would be five billion Middle-Level Source Crystals and five hundred billion Lower-Level Source Crystals.

That number was truly staggering.

Over the years, Yang Kai had killed and plundered, amassing quite a bit of wealth himself. But compared to Fan Wu’s generosity, he was like a child playing at being a thief.

In the entire Star Realm, Upper-Level Source Crystals were limited in number, so no matter the transaction, most were conducted with Lower-Level and Middle-Level Source Crystals. Upper-Level Source Crystals were mostly reserved for cultivation and breakthroughs.

For Fan Wu to hand over fifty million Upper-Level Source Crystals at once was enough to keep a major Sect running for years.

Next to the two piles of Source Crystals was a heap of Demonic Beast Inner Cores.

This was the Ancient Land, where Demonic Beasts were plentiful. When a Demonic Beast died, an Inner Core would naturally remain.

However, there weren’t many Inner Cores here—only a hundred Twelfth-Tier, two thousand Eleventh-Tier, and thirty thousand Tenth-Tier. There were none below the Tenth-Tier; Fan Wu probably figured Yang Kai wouldn’t care for them and simply didn’t bother to include any.

Such a quantity would be a shocking fortune for anyone else, but for Yang Kai, who already possessed a million Inner Cores, it was nothing special.

Still, it couldn’t have been easy for Fan Wu to gather so many Inner Cores. A hundred Twelfth-Tier Inner Cores meant a hundred Emperor Realm Demonic Beasts had died.

Only after countless years of management by the Four Great Saint Venerables in the Ancient Land could so many Inner Cores be amassed. For any human Sect, a hundred Twelfth-Tier Inner Cores would be unimaginable.

Yang Kai’s gaze quickly shifted to another pile of items.

This pile was made up of radiant Spiritual Flowers and Exotic Herbs, all sorts of plants heaped together, with many colorful, enticing Spirit Fruits among them.

Every Spiritual Herb and Spirit Fruit was of Imperial-Grade—there wasn’t a single Dao Origin-Grade item among them.

"Struck it rich!" Yang Kai wiped the corner of his mouth, his eyes practically glowing with excitement.

There were at least ten or twenty thousand stalks of these rare flowers and herbs. With a single glance, Yang Kai spotted several auxiliary materials needed to refine the Life Origin Pill.

Now he was truly rich. Compared to the Source Crystals and Inner Cores, Yang Kai preferred these plants and herbs. For any alchemist, this was enough to drive one mad with excitement.

“But... damn it, how could they just pile up these Spiritual Flowers and Herbs so carelessly? What a waste!” Yang Kai cursed again.

These Spiritual Flowers and Exotic Herbs hadn’t been properly preserved. Over time, their medicinal efficacy would inevitably diminish.

Fortunately, he had the Small Xuan Realm, which still had his own medicine garden. Last time, Yang Kai had even taken the entire ancient medicine garden, expanding his own garden’s area. The ancient garden’s spiritual soil was extremely fertile, perfect for cultivating Spiritual Medicine.

Placing these items in the medicine garden should slow the loss of their medicinal properties.

With this in mind, Yang Kai hurriedly tossed all the Spiritual Medicine from the ring into the Small Xuan Realm’s medicine garden. He didn’t expect to replant them, only hoped their efficacy wouldn’t be lost too much.

There was too much to sort through for now. Yang Kai decided to wait until he had free time to organize everything properly and see if he could find any auxiliary herbs for the Life Origin Fruit among them.

What Fan Wu sent in his Spatial Ring was only these things, but it was indeed a generous gift.

Yang Kai was extremely satisfied.

Next, he picked up the second ring, sensed it, and confirmed that it bore Cang Gou’s aura. This must be the Spatial Ring Cang Gou had sent.

After a careful inspection, Yang Kai found that Cang Gou’s gift was much the same as Fan Wu’s. The two had probably agreed beforehand, as the Source Crystals, Inner Cores, and Spiritual Medicine they sent were nearly identical in quantity.

This didn’t surprise Yang Kai.

He then picked up the third ring, which should be Luan Feng’s Spatial Ring.

As expected, Luan Feng’s gift was the same as the previous two.

The last ring, however, made Yang Kai look forward to it.

This ring bore no one’s aura, but Yang Kai knew it contained Shi Huo’s legacy.

Divine Spirit Shi Huo had lived in the Ancient Land for tens of thousands of years. Just how much wealth he had accumulated over that time was truly a mystery.

When his Divine Sense entered the ring, Yang Kai was dumbfounded.

He saw mountains of Source Crystals—again, two piles, but each was more than ten times larger than those of Fan Wu and the others.

In other words, there were at least thirty billion Middle-Level Source Crystals and five hundred million Upper-Level Source Crystals here.

Even though Yang Kai had mentally prepared himself, he was still deeply shocked.

As for the Inner Cores, there were also ten times as many as those sent by Fan Wu and the others—over a thousand Twelfth-Tier, more than ten thousand Eleventh-Tier, and only a few tens of thousands of Tenth-Tier.

The quantity of Spiritual Medicine was also ten times greater. Just seeing them piled up there was enough to make one’s heart leap with joy.

Adding up the wealth in all four Spatial Rings, there were about thirty-nine billion Middle-Level Source Crystals and as many as six hundred and fifty million Upper-Level Source Crystals.

As for Demonic Beast Inner Cores, Yang Kai already had a million, so what the Saint Venerables sent was just a drop in the bucket.

But the Spiritual Medicines amounted to more than a hundred thousand plants.

What did it mean to have over a hundred thousand Imperial-Grade Spiritual Medicines? Probably only a place like the Wild Ancient Land could produce such a thing. Nowhere else in the Star Realm could possibly have so many.

The wealth Yang Kai now possessed could only be matched by the Sects where the Great Emperors resided—perhaps he even surpassed them. After all, while those Sects were powerful, they had many disciples, and the annual expenses for cultivation were not small.

Among Shi Huo’s legacy, aside from Source Crystals, Inner Cores, and Spiritual Medicine, there were countless rare minerals and all sorts of odds and ends that Yang Kai couldn’t even identify. Most likely, after Shi Huo’s death, everything had been cleared out by Fan Wu and the others and sent to Yang Kai.

Comparing it all, the gifts Fan Wu and the others gave Yang Kai were about a tenth of their own fortunes.

That was already an extremely generous gift. If it weren’t for the descendant of Heaven's Punisher being so close to Yang Kai, who would be willing to hand over a tenth of their entire fortune as a present?

Fan Wu and the others had probably been forced into it.

From the moment he started counting the contents of the four rings, Yang Kai had been grinning like a fool—counting for a while, then giggling, then counting some more, then giggling again…

Ji Yao watched nervously from the side, not knowing what was wrong with her master, but not daring to ask, her expression uneasy.

Only when Yang Kai finally finished laughing did Ji Yao timidly call out, “Master…?”

“Hm?” Yang Kai snapped out of it, realizing his loss of composure. He quickly adjusted his stiff expression and said, “Yao’er, go tell Lady Feng that your master’s injuries are healed. Tomorrow, I’ll be leaving here, so she can rest assured.”

“Yes,” Ji Yao replied, then went downstairs again.
