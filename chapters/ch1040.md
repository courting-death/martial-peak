## Chapter 1040 — Xue Yue

Inside Shen Tu's palace, Yang Kai returned.

The guards stationed at the gate all stood in solemn attention and saluted respectfully.

"Brother Yang, you're back?" Shen Tu's voice suddenly rang from within, and he then strode out laughing to greet him.

"Chairman Ai Ou finally let you go back?" Yang Kai said with a grin as he looked at him.

Shen Tu couldn’t help the twitch at the corner of his mouth. With an irritated look, he said, “Don’t even bring it up. This time I was nearly skinned alive… Come on, come in, we’ll talk inside.”

He greeted him warmly and walked side by side into the palace, asking where Yang Kai had been and why he had been absent for so long.

Yang Kai briefly recounted his travels, then frowned and said, "I have something to tell you."

"What is it?" Shen Tu asked; seeing his grave expression, his own face turned serious.

Yang Kai glanced left and right, adopting a cautious look.

Jia Long, who had been following Shen Tu, said, "Young Brother, rest assured; speaking here won't be leaked out — everyone in the Young Master's palace is loyal to him."

Shen Tu nodded, signaling for Yang Kai to speak boldly and without fear.

"On this trip out... I seem to have killed three fighters from your Commerce Guild," Yang Kai said.

"And then?" Shen Tu pressed.

"Nothing more — I came back right after I killed them."

Shen Tu grinned. "That's no problem; the Guild has many people, and clashes happen often on Shuiyue Star — people die every day. If you killed them it's fine; as long as they aren't high-ranking, there won't be trouble."

"Their ranks shouldn't be high, since they weren't very strong."

"Don't worry, I'll take care of it for you, Brother Yang," Shen Tu said, patting his chest and taking responsibility, not caring about those three dead Guild fighters.

"Let me finish," Yang Kai waved his hand. "This wasn't something I sought out; as I was returning I passed a valley, and then three from that group ran out after me."

"A group?" Shen Tu exclaimed in surprise.

"Yes; in that valley there was a warship about thirty zhang in length anchored, and some of your Hengluo Commerce Guild's fighters were moving some cargo. They were too far to make out what it was. As I passed by they discovered me, and one youth about our age signaled those three to chase and kill me."

Shen Tu's expression shifted; suddenly realizing something was amiss, he hurriedly asked, "Did you see any distinguishing features of those people?"

Yang Kai thought carefully. "If I had to note anything, it was that youth — he was very... pretty. Yes, very pretty."

As he spoke Yang Kai's expression grew odd; describing a man as 'pretty' somehow felt wholly appropriate to him, with nothing amiss.

Shen Tu's face grew even more solemn and ugly; he exchanged a look with Jia Long, and a sense of unease sprang up between them.

"Brother Yang... describe that youth in more detail..." he stammered.

"I didn't see him clearly — only a glimpse. His skin was very pale. A smile on his face that made one feel an immediate warmth, oh, and there were many female fighters around him who seemed besotted with him. His height and age were about the same as ours, and his hair hung over his shoulders," Yang Kai said as he recalled.

"No way." Shen Tu suddenly groaned.

Sensing their reactions were off, Yang Kai couldn't help asking, "Do you know him?"

Shen Tu's mouth twitched, and a flash of fear surfaced deep in his eyes. After a long silence he said, "Brother Yang, you're not an outsider to me, so I won't hide it — the man you saw might... be my Third Brother, Xue Yue!"

When Shen Tu uttered 'Xue Yue', Jia Long's brows couldn't help but twitch, his expression tense as if facing a great enemy.

"Your Third Brother?" Yang Kai was stunned.

"My Third Brother!" Shen Tu nodded gravely.

Jia Long chuckled wryly and explained, "Across Shuiyue Star, Young Master Shen Tu probably fears only two people — the chairman, and this Young Master Xue Yue..."

Yang Kai was astonished and grinned, "What's there to fear about your own brother?"

Shen Tu immediately began to complain bitterly. "If he weren't my brother, I'd have found a way to eliminate him long ago. Brother Yang, you don't know — mention my Third Brother and I shiver... Damn him, the things that guy put me through in childhood; I fear him even more than I fear Father."

Yang Kai couldn't help being intrigued by that uncanny youth; having spent some time with Shen Tu he knew Shen Tu was fearless, yet someone who could cow him into genuine dread was extraordinary indeed.

"Brother Yang, don't mock me; if what you saw really was him, then we're in trouble," Shen Tu said.

"How so?" Yang Kai asked, his face turning solemn.

"If I'm not mistaken... Third Brother has been secretly trading the Guild's scarce materials with some force to amass money. That's the Guild's greatest taboo — forbidden. If this gets out, his trouble will be enormous."

"So that's why they set people to kill me when I passed by?" Yang Kai suddenly understood; everything fell into place.

"Yes! And my Third Brother will not relent until his aim is achieved. If he desires something or someone, no number of obstacles will bar him. He's mercurial and inscrutable — no one can fathom his mind. I remember one year he and a high-ranking Guild member both took a fancy to a maid; even though the Guild elder ultimately won her, that elder mysteriously disappeared a month later."

Yang Kai's expression altered sharply.

Jia Long nodded in agreement. "I recall that— the chairman was furious for a time, but without leads it faded away." "Now, he likely has set his sights on you, Brother Yang; he'll kill you to silence you!" Shen Tu hissed.

Saying this, Shen Tu stood up, looking at Yang Kai with concern.

"Should I lay low then?" Yang Kai asked with knitted brows.

"Hiding may not save you. You don't know how much power my Third Brother commands — he's Father's favored. Many think he'll be the next chairman; he has ears everywhere on Shuiyue Star. If he wants someone, as long as you remain on Shuiyue Star, he'll find you."

Yang Kai gave a bitter laugh; he had merely been out for a stroll and run into this misfortune — truly rotten luck.

"Brother Yang, for now don't go out. Stay in the palace. I'll probe and then come up with a plan," Shen Tu sighed.

"Alright."

Because of this, Yang Kai didn't want to risk appearing in public; he remained in Shen Tu's palace day after day, alternating between sitting in meditation to consolidate his current Stage, refining Pills, or consulting the Star Chart to learn the layout of the Star Domain.

Jia Long would come from time to time to report the situation.

Through him, Yang Kai learned that the Guild's Young Master Xue Yue had indeed been searching for someone, and dark undercurrents roiled across Shuiyue Star. Many innocents had lost their lives because of it.

Yang Kai had thoroughly experienced Xue Yue's cruel methods.

He had only glanced past the valley from afar and hadn't made out Xue Yue's face; it was likely Xue Yue had not clearly seen him either.

Searching a whole star for such a person was like looking for a needle in the ocean; even with the forces Xue Yue could marshal, finding Yang Kai would be difficult.

That was why those with similar build and comparable strength to Yang Kai suffered the misfortune.

Xue Yue would rather mistakenly kill a thousand than let one slip away!

He had more resolve than Chairman Ai Ou and his brothers — a man decisive in slaughter!

Yang Kai found it hard to reconcile such ruthlessness with the face he'd glimpsed; from afar the man had seemed not only unnaturally handsome, but possessed of a peculiar, warming aura.

He shuddered inwardly, knowing not to judge by appearances — Xue Yue's inner savagery was entirely masked by his outward looks. If he fell into Xue Yue's hands, there would be no good outcome, so he obediently stayed in Shen Tu's palace to cultivate in peace.

The deadly undercurrent lasted a full two months; over two thousand people on Shuiyue Star lost their lives because of it, and only after two months did the situation gradually calm.

Jia Long constantly updated Yang Kai on the latest developments so he needn't worry.

Two months later Shen Tu came to Yang Kai with helpless frankness: "Brother Yang, although I very much want to keep you here so that we as brothers might accomplish something together, if you remain here one day my Third Brother will find you, and even I would be unable to protect you."

"You mean?"

"You must leave," Shen Tu sighed. "Now that the situation has eased a little and Third Brother's attention isn't fixed here, I can arrange for you to slip away secretly."

He paused and added, "Of course it's your choice. If you wish to stay, I, Shen Tu, would be deeply grateful — I have few friends, and you count among them — so I'd like to spend more time with you. But even if you stay, you could only hide inside the palace and never venture out."

Yang Kai smiled slightly. "Then I'll leave. Truthfully, even without this matter I had no intention of staying long. I appreciate your kindness, Shen Tu, but I have matters to attend to."

Shen Tu was taken aback; his expression relaxed and he laughed: "So Brother Yang had already planned on leaving. What a pity — I had intended to have you enter the Guild's upcoming talent selection. With your strength in Saint-Grade battles you could certainly make a name for yourself, but it seems there is no need now."

Yang Kai smiled faintly.

"Prepare yourself; I'll see if any suitable warship will depart soon, and I'll notify you when it's ready."

"Good!" Yang Kai agreed.

If he were to leave Shuiyue Star he would of course take a warship — riding a Star Shuttle would take too long and drain too much personal power.

Yang Kai waited in peace.

Ten days later Shen Tu hurriedly arrived to inform Yang Kai that everything had been prepared and he could depart at once.

Yang Kai had nothing to bring and followed Shen Tu out of the palace with a light heart.
