## Chapter 2597 — Bloodline Awakening

For Yang Kai, Ruoxi was willing to give up even her own life, so what did slapping herself matter?

“What are you doing?” Luan Feng’s elegant brows furrowed as she reached out, instantly freezing Ruoxi in place.

With her strength surpassing the Third Stage of the Emperor Realm, restraining Zhang Ruoxi was effortless. Enveloped by that mysterious restriction, Ruoxi couldn’t move at all, nor could she even open her mouth to speak. Her raised hand was frozen midair, and her tears had nearly run dry.

“Boy, are you even a man? To have a little girl do these things for you—ants truly are ants, how laughable!” Shi Huo stomped on Yang Kai as if enjoying a marvelous play, laughing loudly all the while.

Crack—

The sound of several more bones breaking rang out.

Gritting his teeth, Yang Kai endured the piercing pain, swallowing the blood in his mouth. He glared fiercely at the stone giant before him and growled, “Shi Huo, if you want my life, I’ll give it to you. Let Ruoxi and the Stone Spirit Race leave first, then do whatever you want with me!”

“An ant like you—what right do you have to bargain with this Lord?” Shi Huo snorted coldly, swept out a foot, and kicked Yang Kai in the ribs, sending him flying.

Smack—

His battered body crashed to the ground, rolling uncontrollably.

Ruoxi, frozen in place, strained to turn her eyes toward Yang Kai. Her gaze was filled with despair and grief. As her tears dried up, faint streaks of blood began to seep from her eyes, carrying a strange power that silently spread outward.

Yet at this moment, everyone’s attention was on Yang Kai and Shi Huo, so no one noticed this—not even Ruoxi herself.

A faint, violent aura began to grow in her heart, and her blood started to churn restlessly…

“Hm?” Shi Huo frowned, stretched out his large hand, and with a powerful suction, pulled the fallen Yang Kai back. Tilting his head, he looked Yang Kai up and down, clicking his tongue in wonder. “Your body… is rather strange for an ant.”

A First Stage Emperor. After such abuse, he should have died long ago, yet Yang Kai was still alive—though his aura was weak, his vitality was undiminished.

“Shi Huo, don’t push me!” Yang Kai growled in a low voice, like a maddened beast.

Shi Huo raised his brows and burst out laughing. “And what if I do? Are you going to kill this Lord?”

As he spoke, Shi Huo swung his massive fist, smashing it down on Yang Kai again and again.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Each blow landed like a small mountain crashing down. The sound of bones breaking rang out clearly from within Yang Kai’s body, which jerked violently with every hit. Yet, bound by Shi Huo, he couldn’t escape and could only passively endure the relentless assault.

The corners of his eyes split, his head bloodied, and his once-handsome face was now so swollen it was barely human. Shi Huo had beaten him into a bloody mess, hair disheveled and body soaked in blood…

So wretched, so humiliated…

This was an ordeal Yang Kai had never experienced since he began his journey.

Boom—

Shi Huo’s next punch broke both of Yang Kai’s legs, forcing him to his knees. Yet his body remained ramrod straight, like a spear.

The Yao Kings watched with complicated expressions. The vast arena was so silent that even a pin drop could be heard.

Even though humans and yao were different races, and Yang Kai had caused them much trouble this time, seeing him endure such torment without falling moved the Yao Kings. They felt this human was truly a man.

By comparison, Shi Huo’s arrogance and wanton cruelty seemed rather inhumane.

Killing is one thing, but why torment someone like this?

But Shi Huo was, after all, one of the Four Great Saint Venerables. Though the Yao Kings had their opinions, none dared show it. They could only look at Yang Kai with admiration and sympathy. Xie Wuwei wanted to plead for him, but at this moment, who would dare step forward and court disaster?

“That’s enough, Shi Huo!”

Fan Wu’s voice rang out, his face dark.

The opinions the Yao Kings dared not voice, he could.

“There’s nothing glorious about humiliating an opponent far weaker than yourself,” Fan Wu snorted, nearly unable to watch any longer. “If you want to kill him, do it quickly. Stop with these pointless games.”

Shi Huo sneered at these words, clearly displeased, but still grabbed Yang Kai by the hair and lifted his head.

At this moment, Yang Kai’s face was battered and bloody, his features indistinguishable. Only a narrow slit where his eyes should be showed a faint glimmer of light.

He looked toward Ruoxi and managed a grin.

Ruoxi’s whole body trembled violently. Crimson blood streamed from her eyes like long tears, staining her cheeks with two ghastly streaks.

After following Yang Kai for so many years, Ruoxi knew better than anyone what strength and trump cards he possessed.

Sir was not without means to resist.

He still had the power of the ancient demon seal, the world force of the Small Xuan Realm, and the Origin Power of the Golden Sacred Dragon…

Ruoxi believed that if Sir used these powers, even if he couldn’t defeat Shi Huo, he could at least escape.

Yet, even as Shi Huo brutalized him, and even now, on the brink of death, he showed no intention of using them.

All of this was because of her. If Sir escaped, the yao of the Ancient Land would never let her go.

Had she dragged Sir down again? She really had always been his burden. After all these years, why couldn’t she help at all?

Her hatred was enough to overturn rivers and seas.

Her anger seemed capable of destroying the heavens and earth.

A violent aura erupted from her delicate body. In an instant, the gentle girl seemed to become a different person.

“Eh?” Luan Feng sensed the change in Ruoxi’s aura, frowned, and glanced at her. Seeing those two lines of blood tears, she couldn’t help but sigh.

If possible, she would have liked to save Yang Kai, but doing so would mean offending Shi Huo. Weighing the two, she naturally knew which was more important.

“Let Ruoxi and the Stone Spirits go, and I won’t fight back!” Yang Kai, held by the hair, raised his head. A cold light shone from his swollen eyes as he made one last attempt. As long as Ruoxi and the Stone Spirits could leave, he could go all out.

Shi Huo grew furious and mocked, “Do you still have the strength to fight back? Don’t worry, after I kill you, I’ll send that little girl to accompany you on Yellow Springs Road!”

With that, Shi Huo smashed his fist toward Yang Kai’s face. This time, he didn’t hold back—he meant to kill.

After tormenting Yang Kai for so long and seeing his despair and grief, Shi Huo’s anger had mostly subsided. With Fan Wu’s warning, he felt it was time to send Yang Kai on his way, so he didn’t delay.

Facing this blow, Yang Kai’s heart sank. He was about to use the Dragon Transformation Secret Technique when a piercing scream rang out from the other side.

“No!”

The voice was filled with indescribable despair and panic, as well as boundless fury and murderous intent.

“What?” Luan Feng was shocked, quickly looking down at Zhang Ruoxi.

She had tightly controlled the little girl before her. Forget speaking—she could barely move a finger.

Yet now, Ruoxi had actually shouted “No.” How was this possible?

Crack—

The invisible restriction shattered with a roar. The binding Luan Feng placed on Ruoxi was broken, making Luan Feng’s whole body tremble.

At the same time, Ruoxi, still kneeling, had her hair fluttering without wind. An indescribable power awakened in her bloodline, like a slumbering dragon slowly opening its eyes. The aura of that power made even the Four Great Saint Venerables’ hearts skip a beat, and all of them stared at Zhang Ruoxi in shock.

“What’s with this little girl?” Fan Wu exclaimed in surprise.

Shi Huo’s massive hand froze midair, his flame-like eyes fixed on Ruoxi. For some reason, a primal fear welled up in his heart, like a mouse seeing a cat—facing a natural enemy…

That blow never landed on Yang Kai.

Yang Kai was stunned, forcing his swollen eyes open to look at Ruoxi, not knowing what was happening to her.

“Ah!” Ruoxi howled at the sky, unable to suppress the wild power within her. Her dress rustled violently.

Luan Feng’s beautiful face changed, and she quickly retreated, her phoenix eyes fixed nervously on Ruoxi.

Buzz—

Heaven and earth trembled, space itself hummed.

Two drops of crimson blood suddenly flowed from Ruoxi’s eyes. Instead of falling, they seemed drawn by some force, slowly floating to the side.

Everyone’s gaze was drawn to those two drops of blood, staring in a daze.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, the two drops of blood drifted forward, heading toward a certain place.

Following their path, Fan Wu’s eyes narrowed in shock. “Blood Gate!”

The two drops of blood were flying toward the Blood Gate. And at some point, the Blood Gate, which had been calm for tens of thousands of years, began to boil, its surface bubbling with countless bubbles.

“This girl is connected to the Blood Gate?” Cang Gou exclaimed in surprise.

Fan Wu slowly shook his head. Even with his experience and knowledge, he couldn’t make sense of what was happening.

Whoosh, whoosh—

The two drops of blood suddenly accelerated, shooting straight into the Blood Gate and vanishing.

Boom—

From within the Blood Gate, a crimson light shot out, striking Ruoxi’s body. She shuddered, her scream abruptly ceasing. Her fluttering hair fell, and she knelt there, head bowed, motionless as if dead.

Yang Kai was startled, quickly sending out his Divine Sense to check, only to find Ruoxi’s vitality surging.

But…

The feeling Ruoxi gave Yang Kai now was so unfamiliar, her aura completely different from before, as if she had become a different person.
