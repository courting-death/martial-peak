## Chapter 1893 — Want To Give It A Try

Discussing matters to their hearts' content with Chi Yue was an unexpected delight for Yang Kai.

After Yang Kai left Chi Yue's bedchamber having set the agreed time, Chi Yue said she would do her best to break through to the Third Stage of the Void King Realm within that period, put everything on Di Chen Star in order, and go explore broader realms.

The next day, Ba He came to Yang Kai's room and handed him a Spatial Ring, saying, “This was given to you by the lord; the three Void King-Grade Inner Cores are inside it. Inner Cores of that grade are rare even on Di Chen, and the outside world is even harder to find them in. As for the other materials, check them and see if they are enough — if not, I'll fetch more.”

Yang Kai took the ring, scanned its contents with his Divine Sense, and smiled, nodding, “Please thank the Lord for me; the materials are more than sufficient.”

“Enough is fine. But……” Ba He looked at Yang Kai with some shock and asked in a low voice, “Can you really lay down that kind of interstellar teleportation array?”

After yesterday's detailed talk with Chi Yue, Yang Kai had immediately said he intended to lay a Great Space Array on Di Chen Star to link Di Chen Star and Dark Star, so that when Shan Qingluo later succeeded in a breakthrough she could travel to Dark Star at any time.

Chi Yue was also taken aback; she did not quite dare to believe Yang Kai possessed such a skill, but since he spoke with conviction she had no reason to doubt him, and so she secretly instructed Ba He to prepare the necessary materials.

“A minor task!” Yang Kai grinned broadly.

Ba He said, “Then I must observe carefully — come with me.”

Somehow the news that Yang Kai planned to set up a Great Space Array even reached people like Shen Tu.

When Yang Kai, led by Ba He, arrived at a huge clearing within Half Moon Mountain, Yu Xiong, Shen Tu, Li Nuo, Hua Youmeng, Chun Yi and others were all waiting there.

Upon seeing Yang Kai, Shen Tu rushed forward excitedly and asked, “Yang Kai, can you really set up an array capable of teleporting between stars?”

The others all stared at him with eager eyes.

“Yes.” Yang Kai nodded slightly.

Shen Tu immediately opened his mouth wide, his expression inexplicably stirred.

“No need to be so dramatic. It's only a Great Space Array.” Yang Kai said with a wry laugh.

"Only?" Ba He interjected beside him, his voice oddly charged. "You seriously underestimate the meaning of such things. There are still a few star-spanning teleportation formations left in the Star Domain, but none of them are usable. Only ancient great masters could lay such arrays. You have no idea the revolution they would bring to the entire Star Domain."

“Indeed!” Shen Tu collected himself and nodded solemnly at the side. “Not to mention others, take our Hengluo Commerce Guild for example — our business reaches across the Star Domain. Every voyage takes, at the least, three to five months, and at most three to five years; round trips consume tremendous time. If such Great Space Arrays could link the major Cultivation Stars, our transportation costs would be negligible, and each deal would generate considerable profit for the Guild. Accumulated over the years, the wealth would be terrifying!”

“That’s not all!” Ba He slowly shook his head. “If Great Space Arrays could be used, martial artists traveling between stars would do so far more conveniently and safely. Who would risk their life crossing the Starry Sky then? Charging usage fees for the arrays alone would make one a fortune. Yang Kai, do not belittle this skill — if a Great Space Array truly came into being, it would change the Star Domain utterly, and you would become a benefactor of the entire region!”

Yang Kai nodded calmly.

He had thought of such possibilities before, but because it was his own ability and he could use it at any time, he had not been overly concerned.

Yet……

“Why are you all so excited?” Yang Kai asked, looking at Ba He and Shen Tu in surprise.

Ba He paused, then laughed, “It is my honor to witness such a revolution's birth; of course I am excited. It's like an ancient true dragon appearing here — who wouldn't be stirred?”

Yang Kai thought about it and agreed that it was indeed so.

“Yang Kai, could you set up several of these Great Space Arrays for our Hengluo Commerce Guild? Rest assured, the Guild will provide the materials and will give you satisfactory compensation.” Shen Tu looked at Yang Kai earnestly.

Yang Kai was about to agree outright when a thought occurred to him and he grinned, “That is naturally not a problem, but……”

“But what?”

“But I need to discuss it personally with Chairman Ai Ou. I have something to request of him, so it would be convenient for everyone to trade terms.” Yang Kai said cheerfully.

Hearing Shen Tu's remarks earlier, Yang Kai had suddenly realized how monumental the Great Space Array he could set up would be for the Hengluo Commerce Guild, and he might use that leverage to exchange for the Star Emperor Token the Guild possessed.

Although the Star Emperor Token was an artifact left by the great emperor and had little practical use, a shrewd man like Chairman Ai Ou would certainly know how to weigh it.

Besides, Yang Kai also had the Star Refining Technique he most desired.

At that thought Yang Kai felt reassured; he was convinced the Hengluo Commerce Guild's Star Emperor Token would surely end up in his hands.

He even believed he could obtain the Sword Alliance's Star Emperor Token the same way.

The Sword Alliance, though not as commercially widespread as the Hengluo Commerce Guild, held many Cultivation Stars. Linking them with Great Space Arrays would surely persuade the Alliance's leaders to accept Yang Kai's terms.

“No issue with that, but my father is not easy to deal with — be careful you don't get thoroughly fleeced.” Shen Tu chuckled.

“I'll be cautious.”

“No time to waste, set it up quickly — I want to see the birth of that Great Space Array!” Ba He urged from the side.

Yang Kai nodded and no longer delayed. He ordered everyone to stand back and began counting the materials in the Spatial Ring and laying out the Great Space Array.

This was not his first time; Yang Kai was already adept at such work.

Precious materials were fused and smelted in his hands, formed into various shapes and assembled, and within a day or two the vast Formation Foundation had taken shape. Then everyone felt mysterious energies begin to swirl around Yang Kai as if he were carving something upon the Formation Foundation with his Divine Sense.

The whole process seemed tedious because none of those present were versed in arrays.

Even an array master might not be able to discern the subtleties.

After all, Yang Kai was inscribing the diagram with spatial force, making it impossible for others to peer into.

But since they were witnessing the birth of such a world-shaking feat, none showed impatience; all stood quietly watching.

Ethereal Crystals floated up under unseen power, burst into dust, and merged into the Formation Foundation.

Ba He observed silently and realized that the materials Yang Kai had used over these days were worth at least one hundred million Saint Crystals — and that was merely for laying a single array!

Across the Star Domain that was an extravagant expense.

Yet thinking of the array's function and uses, Ba He soon relaxed.

By the fifth day the array had taken form, but Yang Kai watched in silence and seemed unsatisfied. He then took from his Spatial Ring several Ethereal Crystals obtained from the Lost Realm.

Those Ethereal Crystals had originated within a rift in the void and were the purest kind, a thousandfold more potent than the ones Ba He had provided.

These Ethereal Crystals shattered into powder and were incorporated into the array, instantly changing it; the whole formation looked like a patch of emptiness, as if it sought to devour all.

Yang Kai busied himself with finishing touches.

Another day passed, and it was finally complete.

They had stood by for six or seven days; only when Yang Kai looked as if the great work was done did they all step forward.

“This thing… can it really be used?” Yu Xiong asked as he circled the Great Space Array. “How far can it teleport to in terms of Cultivation Stars?”

“It can directly teleport to the Dark Star where my sect is located.” Yang Kai smiled slightly. “As for distance, I can't say for sure, but if you were to cross the void by your own means it would take roughly four to five years.”

Yu Xiong drew in a cold breath.

Ba He and the others were also full of shock.

Four or five years — enough for any martial artist to seclude and comprehend a technique, study secret arts, and refine Secret Treasures; now a single array could level that time. It was hard to accept.

“Want to give it a try?” Yang Kai asked with a smile.

“Try — of course!” Yu Xiong, as if fearless, stepped directly into the center of the array.

“I'll go too.” Ba He walked up at a leisurely pace.

“Take me with you.” Shen Tu also hopped forward.

“Second Young Master!” Li Nuo cried out in alarm and was about to stop him, but Shen Tu glowered at her with a look that shut her up.

“Don't worry — it won't be dangerous. Even if the teleportation goes wrong, I can bring them back from the void.” Yang Kai smiled confidently and took out some more materials to start forging an object.

In a short while the item was finished — it was a token.

“What's that for?” Ba He asked thoughtfully as he looked at the token in Yang Kai's hand.

“A Teleportation Token!” Yang Kai explained. “Anyone using a Space Array I lay down must hold a Teleportation Token I specially forged; otherwise they will be cast into the endless void.”

Ba He's eyes brightened and he quickly understood, admiring, “You thought this through!”

The Great Space Array would bring convenience to friends and foes alike; if one day enemies used such means to strike directly, the consequences would be grave.

But the existence of the Teleportation Token would completely eliminate that danger.

Unless an enemy could collect a large number of Teleportation Tokens, they would be powerless.

“Stand firm.” Yang Kai called softly. With a single hand motion he tossed hundreds of Saint Crystals into the grooves of the Formation Foundation; the next moment the array began to draw upon the Saint Crystals' power and came to life.
