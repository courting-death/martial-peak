## Chapter 646 — Provocation

Just as Yang Kai had guessed earlier, the people of Mo Shen Fort had been sealed in the Small Xuan Realm for so many years that Crystal Stones had become rare treasures to them.

The local Spiritual Qi here was not thin, but with the assistance of Crystal Stones the demonic cultivators’ strength could have risen rapidly. Over countless years, however, Mo Shen Fort’s supply of Crystal Stones dwindled, until there were very few left.

The dozens of Crystal Stones Li Rong had asked Guan'er to give Yang Kai were the last of Li Rong’s own reserves.

So when word got out that Yang Kai actually had Crystal Stones in his possession, Pan Lang inevitably became tempted.

“A mere human warrior — what qualification does he have to use Crystal Stone?”

“What do you intend to do?” the other demonic cultivator immediately realized this looked bad. “Pan Lang, don’t get any wicked ideas. Lady Li has treated this human cultivator well recently and explicitly ordered that no one bully him.”

“Who said I want to bully him?” Pan Lang snorted coldly. “And who saw me bully him?”

The demonic cultivator hesitated, scratching his head and thinking for a moment, his expression indecisive.

Pan Lang looked into the stone chamber with an evil gleam and let out a few sinister chuckles.

Inside the stone chamber, Yang Kai waited as Guan'er directed the young women to set the things down. He then boldly took a seat at the table and began to eat ravenously.

Guan'er curled her lip in disdain, her face full of resentment.

She didn't know why, but ever since two months ago Lady Li had been unusually attentive to this human cultivator, treating him in a way that made many of the clan envious.

She had asked Lady Li about the reason, but Lady Li had not explained.

“I’d die of envy!” Guan'er pouted her red lips, utterly jealous.

Yang Kai waved a hand. “Let's eat together. There’s too much; I can’t finish it all.”

“Who wants it!” Guan'er snorted and turned to leave. Faintly, Yang Kai heard the sound of swallowing and couldn’t help but smile wryly.

From Guan'er's recent attitude toward him, Yang Kai knew the food she had brought was indeed good stuff.

He could clearly feel that after eating, his flesh and blood were undergoing subtle, silent changes, developing in a beneficial direction.

Before long, Yang Kai had cleared everything Guan'er had brought. The young women who had assisted Guan'er tidied up and left one after another.

Yang Kai stretched, rested for a while, then plunged eagerly back into the world of alchemy.

He did not know how long had passed when, while refining pills in the stone chamber, Yang Kai suddenly stiffened and pricked up his ears.

He heard faint footsteps outside and the low breathing of people sneaking toward the stone chamber.

A playful expression crossed Yang Kai’s face.

He had been here for several months; though many of the demonic cultivators looked down on him, none had ever dared cause him trouble. Why was someone breaking that pattern today?

There were quite a few people approaching — six or seven in total — all cultivators of the Divine Roaming Realm. The one leading them had even reached the peak of the Divine Roaming Realm.

Not showing any change in expression, Yang Kai continued to pour his True Yuan into the alchemy furnace, refining the medicinal properties of the materials with practiced control.

With a creak, the stone door opened and six or seven figures filed in one after another.

Once inside, they quickly shut the stone door.

Yang Kai glanced up and saw that the leader was a young man with a hooked nose and a sullen face, sneering at him with a predatory smile.

His look combined contempt with disdain; like most of Mo Shen Fort’s people, he looked down on Yang Kai. Yang Kai paid him no mind and silently shook his head.

“Hm, Pan Lang, this human is interesting — he’s not afraid of us at all,” one of the demonic cultivators exclaimed in surprise.

“Heh heh, he thinks Lady Li will protect him, so of course he doesn’t fear us,” Pan Lang sneered continuously as he strode toward Yang Kai.

When he reached Yang Kai, he crouched down, a mocking smile at his mouth, staring intently at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai remained unmoved, calmly pouring True Yuan into the furnace and controlling the heat.

This display of disregard irritated Pan Lang. He reached out, slapped the alchemy furnace, allowing True Yuan to pour in; the herbs inside instantly turned to charcoal.

“Human, you’re presumptuous,” Pan Lang’s lip curled in a face full of provocation.

“Say what you have to say. Don’t ruin my ingredients!” Yang Kai inhaled softly, watching him with an indifferent expression.

“These materials belong to Mo Shen Fort, not to you,” Pan Lang snorted.

Yang Kai frowned, a trace of impatience appearing. This young man had clearly come to pick a quarrel; Yang Kai did not have the patience to dally. He said coldly, “What do you want?”

“Nothing much. I just heard you’re an alchemist?” Pan Lang stood, scanning the room. When he spotted the jade bottles arranged to the side, his eyes lit up. “These are the pills you refined?”

The pills Yang Kai had been refining recently were all stored in those jade bottles. He had no intention of claiming them for himself — after all, the materials had been supplied by Mo Shen Fort. He was content to use them to improve his alchemy.

If Li Rong needed those pills, Yang Kai wouldn't mind giving them all to her.

Moreover, they were all Earth-Grade and Heaven-Grade pills, not of particularly high rank.

Unexpectedly, Pan Lang’s gaze landed on them immediately.

The demonic cultivators behind Pan Lang rushed forward, picked up the jade bottles and sniffed them. Their faces showed delight. “The grade isn’t bad. Heaven-Grade pills might even be useful to us.”

Pan Lang waved a large hand. “Take them all.”

The demonic cultivators’ faces lit up and they quickly divided the jade bottles among themselves.

“These were meant for Lady Li. If you take them, how am I to explain it?” Yang Kai frowned.

“I don’t care how you explain it. Say you consumed them yourself, say your refining failed — you can make up some reason, can’t you?” Pan Lang sneered. “Not only will I take these pills now, but from now on, half of whatever pills you refine will belong to me. If not… heh heh.”

A heavy threat hung in the air.

“If Lady Li were to find out about this, you’d have big trouble, wouldn’t you?” Yang Kai laughed.

“If you dare tell her, I’ll make sure you die without a burial place,” Pan Lang snorted. Seeing Yang Kai silent, he assumed Yang Kai was cowed and smugly wagged his head. “Human, I also heard Lady Li rewarded you with quite a few Crystal Stones. Hand them over if you don’t want to suffer.”

Saying that, he brazenly reached his hand toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly and slowly rose to his feet. “I understand. So you really did come to cause trouble.”

“And?” Pan Lang laughed scornfully. “What gives a human the right to enjoy such treatment? I, Pan Lang, am Mo Shen Fort’s future pillar; I deserve that right!”

“With your strength?” Yang Kai shook his head, rolled his neck and said, “Fine — it’s been months since I last fought someone. It’s rare for someone to come and help loosen my muscles. I can’t refuse such generosity.”

Pan Lang froze, staring at Yang Kai in astonishment for a long moment before reacting: “You want to fight us?”

Yang Kai nodded.

The demonic cultivators heard this as if it were the funniest joke and burst into uproarious laughter. Pan Lang laughed so hard he was out of breath, pointing at Yang Kai and telling his clanmates, “Did you hear? He actually wants to fight us. Ha! A human dares to battle our ancient demon clan — he must not know the meaning of death.”

“Let me teach him a lesson,” a burly demonic cultivator stepped forward from behind Pan Lang, smiling. “Humans have always been arrogant and fail to see the situation clearly.”

“Then let him learn his place!” Pan Lang’s smile vanished and his voice turned cold.

Although Lady Li treated Yang Kai well, he was, after all, of another race. In the past, many human alchemists who came here were also disciplined by the demonic cultivators. Lady Li never interfered as long as they were not killed; no serious trouble would follow.

Because of this, they were confident this time as well, assuming Yang Kai was like those past human alchemists.

The burly demonic cultivator pointed at Yang Kai, hooked a finger and sneered, “I’ll let you strike first!”

“Then you won’t have the chance!” Yang Kai snorted.

At that moment a loud bang echoed through the stone chamber. The burly demonic cultivator’s body shot backward like a cannonball, flying dozens of Zhang into the stone wall, leaving a dent. Spiderweb-like cracks spidered across the surrounding walls; the recoil threw the demonic cultivator to the ground, where he rolled several times before coming to a stop.

Pan Lang and the others’ eyes narrowed, their smiles frozen on their faces.

When they looked at Yang Kai again, their expressions had turned considerably more serious.

The force of that blow had been not only swift but extraordinarily powerful, almost on par with one of their demonic cultivators.

“Has some skill, huh?” Pan Lang was greatly surprised, sizing Yang Kai up, yet showing no concern for his companion. “No wonder he’s so arrogant.”

“Not bad!” the others nodded one after another.

Yang Kai frowned slightly, glancing at the demonic cultivator he had sent flying, his face showing puzzlement.

He knew how strong his strike had been; a blow like that should have knocked a cultivator of that rank unconscious. Yet to his surprise, the demonic cultivator lightly coughed, staggered, and managed to stand again, his face a mixture of pain and mounting fury.

“How do you feel?” Pan Lang called out loudly.

The demonic cultivator felt along his body and said in a low voice, “A row of ribs is broken, but it’s nothing major!”

“If it’s nothing major, then give him a bloody lesson so he won’t look down on us!” Pan Lang snorted.

“Exactly my plan!” the demonic cultivator replied. The burly figure unleashed unimaginable speed and flashed toward Yang Kai like lightning.

As he charged, Yang Kai clearly saw several jet-black marks appear across the demonic cultivator’s face, accentuating his already savage, furious mien.

Those markings appeared in a most eerie fashion, like snakes crawling up his face. With their appearance, the demonic cultivator’s aura shifted, and his strength surged up another level.
