## Chapter 1581 — Hard Clash

“Xue Lian, be careful — that’s the human I mentioned before,” Mi Tian said, casting a cold look at Yang Kai as he warned softly.

The yao warrior called Xue Lian frowned, eyeballed Yang Kai with a swaggering air, and curled his lip: “This is the human who killed your two Thunderflame Flying Lizards? He doesn’t look like much.”

He behaved as if Yang Kai were beneath his notice, his expression full of contempt.

Mi Tian gave a chuckle. “Xue Lian, if you despise him merely because he’s human, you’d be making a grave mistake — he… seems somewhat different from those on Di Chen Star.”

“Hmph. After more than a decade away, Mi Tian, where did your old edge go, to be so quick to heap praise on a human? Ridiculous. If any of my cart-pulling Demonic Beasts had been killed, he wouldn’t live to see the next sunrise. Mi Tian, you’re finished — Di Chen will be my domain.” Xue Lian paid Mi Tian little mind as he spat out scornful taunts.

Mi Tian didn’t look offended at all; instead he smiled and said, “I’m only giving you a warning — whether you heed it is up to you. Heh heh.”

The two yao experts traded barbs without lowering their voices, and Yang Kai heard every word clearly.

He couldn’t help but regard Xue Lian with interest, an odd expression crossing his face.

This Xue Lian must truly be someone of importance, otherwise who would dare speak to Mi Tian like that? He knew Mi Tian was the Thousand-Eyed Lord’s young scion and famed across Di Chen Star; to stand toe-to-toe with him and sneer so mercilessly — what background did Xue Lian have?

Yet his cultivation was by no means inferior to Mi Tian’s; he too was a Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm expert!

“Do you two need something?” Yang Kai asked lightly, a smile on his face, though a trace of coldness flickered in his eyes.

“We have business here,” Xue Lian sneered, looking at Yang Kai with disdain. “But you have no right to speak to me. Bring out that human named Xia.”

“Want to see my Little Senior Sister?” Yang Kai laughed softly and shook his head. “That won’t do — she’s refining pills and won’t see anyone.”

“She refuses?” Xue Lian’s expression hardened and he snorted coldly. “She won’t be allowed to refuse! Since I’ve come, she will see me. Whether she wants to or not.”

Mi Tian stood behind Xue Lian, smiling as he chimed in: “Brother Xue Lian has come for the young lady’s pill-refining — he's heard her skills are excellent. Brother Xue Lian has the materials ready. As long as she takes them and refines the pills, it will be fine.”

“Refining pills is fine!” Yang Kai nodded. “No need to bother my Senior Sister over such a small matter — I’ll agree on her behalf. Hand over the ingredients, then go back and wait a few days.”

Mi Tian raised an eyebrow while Xue Lian sneered. “Give the materials to you? What are you? I heard you’re just a pretty face living off a woman, a milksop. Tell that woman to come out and show herself! A mere human little wench, daring to put on airs before me — I’ll tear her to pieces!”

The smile on Yang Kai’s face slowly faded as his eyes narrowed, a sudden chill of ruthless indifference flashing within them. “Did you just insult my Senior Sister?”

“You deaf? What of it if I insult her?”

“It does matter. You’ll pay for it.”

Yang Kai’s voice turned frigid. Without any visible movement, he suddenly appeared not far in front of Xue Lian and slammed a punch toward his face, Saint Yuan roaring through his fist.

The other clearly came to pick a fight, and Yang Kai had no intention of talking any longer.

Xue Lian was startled — he hadn’t seen Yang Kai’s movement clearly, but a keen killing intent struck him. He roared and threw a punch to meet him.

Anger and ridicule filled his eyes.

Yang Kai’s sudden strike indeed shocked him; no human had ever dared to strike at him first.

Yet this human overestimated himself, thinking to match him with sheer physical force! Even on Yao Star Di Chen, his bloodline’s physical strength was top-tier, unmatched by many yao experts, let alone a human.

He struck with all his might, certain Yang Kai would be blasted to pieces.

“Boom…”

The two fists met in empty air and the void seemed to collapse as if in an instant, ripples visible to the naked eye spreading ferociously outward.

Yang Kai’s body shuddered; he raised an eyebrow, a hint of surprise showing.

Xue Lian’s eyes widened, disbelief plain on his face.

In that collision both felt the ferocious force transmitted from the other, both sensed the other was not to be trifled with.

The enormous force reverberated, knocking both back several steps before they steadied themselves.

“Incredible!” Mi Tian praised without restraint; the moment Yang Kai moved he had drifted elegantly to a safe distance, and from his vantage he saw the clash clearly.

He was greatly surprised.

Although he believed himself stronger than Xue Lian overall, in raw physical strength he could not compare; Xue Lian’s bloodline gave him toughness and berserk power unmatched by Mi Tian.

If Mi Tian had to duel Xue Lian alone, he would avoid direct bodily clashes and use his strengths against the other’s weakness.

But this Yang Kai actually fought Xue Lian to a standstill! That first exchange showed neither side had gained the upper hand…

Mi Tian’s expression grew grave — it became clear Yang Kai’s killing of his two Thunderflame Flying Lizards in Huiyue City had not been a fluke; he truly possessed that capability.

This promised to be entertaining! Mi Tian’s interest skyrocketed; he looked up toward a spot a hundred zhang away.

There Yu Xiong stood on a palace roof with his arms folded, grinning as he peered down from above. Seeing Mi Tian’s gaze, he raised a hand in greeting and joined him in watching.

“This human is quite interesting!” Xue Lian sized Yang Kai up and down, a look of newfound appraisal in his eyes, then roared loudly, “Come again!”

At his shout a strange blood-red light surged across his body, crimson and vicious, and under its shroud Xue Lian’s aura spiked.

He strode forward toward Yang Kai.

Each step shook the earth, leaving deep footprints; from each print the ground split with dense fissures like a spiderweb.

A cutting killing intent descended over Yang Kai.

The killing intent seemed solid, like blades slicing his body; its icy aura chilled one’s marrow and made one want to flee.

Yang Kai could neither avoid it nor did he wish to.

A low, muffled growl came from his throat like that of a maddened beast. His muscles swelled, his bones crackled sharply, and his aura surged explosively, colliding with the omnipresent killing intent around him and shredding that invisible force to dust.

Xue Lian reached Yang Kai and his fists rained down like hail, bringing cataclysmic force to bear against him.

Yang Kai showed no intention of dodging, allowing the opponent’s strike to land squarely on him, while his own iron fists drove straight toward Xue Lian’s vital points in retaliation.

Boom, boom, boom…

The dull thuds made the scalp tingle, mixed with the occasional grunt from both.

Yang Kai showed no sign of defeat; instead the two traded blows fiercely.

Mi Tian was moved, Yu Xiong gaped, and the green-robed maid was rendered breathless, her beautiful eyes trembling as she watched.

She had long thought Yang Kai a shameless man who lived off a woman and had pained for Xia Ningshang, thinking she had chosen poorly when there were so many worthy men in the world.

But now she finally understood that the man she had written off did have a shining side.

Simply for the sake of his woman, daring to stand toe-to-toe with Young Master Xue and clash — that was intoxicating.

Such a man was tremendously handsome!

Xue Lian’s proud strength and physique failed to impose any suppression over Yang Kai; the other’s mastery in this domain was clearly on par with his.

His eyes cold and fierce like a bloodthirsty Demonic Beast, Yang Kai tangled with Xue Lian in a world of fists and kicks; every strike shook heaven and earth, power surging like a tide.

Between them, violent force splashed through the void; that pure physical might ascended into something indescribable — a profound intent — that wrapped them both.

Even experts like Mi Tian and Yu Xiong could no longer discern what was happening within the battlefield. They could only see the two figures weaving and clashing, hear the continuous explosions, and feel the terrifying force behind each strike.

A fight to the death!

Xue Lian roared in fury, voice brimming with wrath, and Yang Kai raged like a madman; though meeting for the first time, they treated each other as mortal enemies, both eyes flashing bloody light that chilled the soul.

The two silhouettes locked and unleashed continuous barrages as if hill-folk who had never cultivated, wielding nothing but raw force to try to outmatch the other in this domain.

Light flared with each strike like meteors streaking by, brilliant and dazzling, intoxicating to behold.

Such a crude, brute style of combat was usually scorned by martial artists, yet at this moment it shone magnificently under their hands.

Any force perfected to its extreme must not be underestimated.

Xue Lian became more and more alarmed as the fight went on.

He had never imagined a human could tie him blow for blow in raw physical combat. His punches struck Yang Kai as if against solid rock, ringing like metal on metal.

Yang Kai’s body was so formidable he felt he faced an iron-clad frame rather than flesh and blood.

How could this be? Even yao famed for physical prowess could not compare to his bloodline; how had a human achieved such a thing?

Is he even human?
