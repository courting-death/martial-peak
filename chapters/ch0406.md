## Chapter 406 — Do You Wish to Be My Enemy?

Yang Family's direct descendant, the fourth in the younger generation, Yang Xinwu, was ambushed on his way back to Zhongdu and gravely injured!

The two Blood Servants who welcomed him back to the family exerted the Blood Fury Technique with all their might, yet still failed to protect him completely.

Hurriedly taken home for treatment, his condition worsened, and no matter what miraculous Pills were administered, there was no improvement. Ultimately, he succumbed to his injuries just the day before, leaving this world.

So far, among the Yang Family disciples returning to Zhongdu, five had unfortunately encountered ambushes, including the eldest Yang Wei, the fifth Yang Kang, and the seventh Yang Ying. However, these four were merely frightened, with only Yang Kang and Yang Ying suffering minor injuries, while Yang Wei and Yang Kai remained unscathed, much luckier than Yang Xinwu.

The struggle for succession had yet to commence, yet a disciple from within the clan had already perished, a situation that had never occurred before.

The Yang Family was furious and vowed to find the culprit and annihilate his entire family.

The reason Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian came to see Yang Kai this time was, in fact, related to those two Blood Servants who had welcomed Yang Xinwu back.

"Is the family going to execute those two?" Yang Kai furrowed his brows, considering a possibility.

Fourth Master Yang slowly shook his head. "The family does not intend to do that; after all, they fought with all they had, covered in injuries, and have also suffered greatly. Even to this day, they have not recovered. As Blood Servants, they have fulfilled their duty; the family will not act so harshly."

Every Blood Servant is not easy to cultivate and is loyal to the Yang Family. The elders in the hall, as long as they retain a bit of rationality, would not execute the two Blood Servants for this reason.

If such a thing were to happen, it would only leave the remaining Blood Servants feeling disheartened.

"However, certain punishment is unavoidable," Fourth Master Yang said with a helpless shake of his head.

Tu Feng said sadly, "The two brothers are already injured, and now being dealt a hundred strikes, their meridians severed numerous times, their future achievements may very well end here…"

The planks used by the Yang Family for punishment were no ordinary planks, but rather special treasures. A hundred strikes would be unbearable even for Blood Servants in their peak condition, let alone when they were already injured.

Years ago, Fourth Master Yang endured thirty strikes and lay in bed for several months.

Tang Yuxian, on one side, also wore a saddened expression, her face filled with worry.

"Having failed to protect Fourth Young Master, they carry immense guilt, and with this incident occurring, those two brothers must be feeling… disheartened." Tu Feng pressed his dry lips together, his face filled with sorrow.

"If they can't withstand this blow, what kind of Blood Servants are they?" Yang Kai huffed lightly.

"Kai’er," Yang Yingfeng called gently, shaking his head. "You wouldn't say this if you understood the loyalty the Blood Servants hold for the family. It's not that they feel disheartened because they can't improve their own strength. What weighs on their minds is the death of your fourth brother, as they feel they've betrayed the family's cultivation. Had your fourth brother not died, they might not find it so hard to bear, but now… sigh…"

Yang Kai glanced at Fourth Master Yang, remaining silent for a long time before nodding. "Perhaps I underestimated the loyalty of the Blood Servants."

He turned back to Tu Feng and said, "So, what business do you have for me this time? Healing those two? I don’t have that kind of ability."

"Not that," Tu Feng gently shook his head, "Yuxian and I want to ask that Young Master make those two brothers serve you during the struggle for succession!"

Yang Kai stared in disbelief. "Why?"

Tu Feng explained, "Although they’ve said nothing, we can feel it. In this struggle for succession, if Young Master does not take advantage of their strengths, those two may very well choose to abandon their cultivation and apologize to the family, retreating into the mountains."

The two Blood Servants had failed to protect Yang Xinwu, leading the younger generation of the Yang Family to view them unfavorably. Coupled with their current injuries, it was uncertain how long their healing would take. In the upcoming struggle for succession, it seemed likely that no one would use them.

"Ridiculous!" Yang Kai barked. "The family has expended so much financial and material resources to cultivate them to their current state, and they think they can just give up? If the Blood Servants are loyal to the Yang Family, then their cultivation belongs to the Yang Family, and they have no right to decide for themselves!"

Although his words were harsh, Tu Feng perceived something unusual within them and quickly replied with excitement, "So, does that mean the Young Master is willing to make use of them?"

Tang Yuxian also hurriedly added, "As long as they feel they have value, they will not be so pessimistic."

"When have I ever said that?" Yang Kai rolled his eyes, suddenly realizing that Tu Feng was one to ride the coattails of others.

However, Yang Kai finally grasped why Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian approached him today and understood why they said they were willing to follow him, aiding him in any way they could.

Should he truly agree to Tu Feng’s request, he could only choose those two Blood Servants; as for his familiar companions, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian, they would inevitably fall into someone else's hands.

"This really is an unwelcome request, but among this generation of young masters, only Yuxian and I have familiarity with Young Master. The other Blood Servants have barely exchanged a few words with other young lords, and there's practically no connection; thus, we can only shamelessly ask for your support."

"Who told you Blood Servants to be so arrogant, thinking yourselves to be what kind of big figures?" Yang Kai scoffed.

Tu Feng forced a laugh, "Other young lords lack the means and ability to subdue us."

Yang Yingfeng and Dong Suzhu exchanged glances, astonished and delighted upon seeing the same expressions reflected in each other's eyes.

In other words, Yang Kai had already subdued Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

"Younger Master..." Tu Feng rubbed his hands together, nervously glancing at him, while Tang Yuxian beside him looked at him with hopeful eyes, her beautiful gaze filled with longing.

Yang Kai remained quiet, his expression stern, fingers lightly tapping the back of the chair, producing a steady beat.

The room fell silent, with Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's hearts rising to their throats, staring intently at Yang Kai, waiting for his decision.

Fourth Master Yang sipped his tea, his face serious, giving no sign that he intended to speak; Dong Suzhu kept her head down, her fingers twisting anxiously.

The two elders evidently did not wish to interfere with Yang Kai's decision.

After a long moment, after time had passed sufficient for a cup of tea, Yang Kai abruptly ceased his movements, and Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian perked up, holding their breath in anticipation.

"What if I say I don't want to use them?" Yang Kai asked gravely, staring at the two.

Tu Feng forced a bitter smile, "Young Master considering this is already enough. At the very least, Yuxian and I understand that Young Master leans towards letting us follow you, which is an honor for us!"

Tang Yuxian nodded earnestly beside him, her face showing gratitude.

Yang Kai's gaze suddenly sharpened, scrutinizing the two before speaking solemnly, "Do you wish to be my enemy?"

Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian's expressions stiffened, and they sincerely replied, "We hope that day never comes!"

"Pray for it; hope you are not chosen by other young lords," Yang Kai grinned maliciously, confidence suffusing his expression. "But even if you are chosen by others, I will snatch you back!"

Hearing the insinuation behind Yang Kai's words, Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian couldn't contain their delight and leapt up from their seats in excitement. "Young Master has agreed?!"

Yang Kai nodded, sounding slightly reluctant. "Actually… I don't think that highly of those two, but since you’ve come to me, I’ll reluctantly allow them to accompany me."

"We, the two subordinates, thank Young Master on behalf of all the Blood Servants!" 

"Thank you for your grace, Young Master!" Tang Yuxian's lovely face flushed with joy as she smiled.

"Go, I will negotiate this matter with the elders' hall tomorrow," Yang Kai waved his hand.

"Yes!" Both of them excitedly headed towards the door, clearly eager to relay this good news to the Blood Servants Hall.

As they reached the door, Tu Feng turned back and said, "Oh, Young Master, although those two brothers are currently seriously injured and unable to provide much assistance, they… their potential is highly remarkable."

"Highly remarkable? How so compared to you?" Yang Kai inquired with surprise.

"Stronger than us!" Tu Feng had an earnest expression. "The hall master once said that if those two brothers had enough opportunities, they might very well break through to beyond the Divine Roaming Realm!"

"I see." Yang Kai nodded indifferently, showing neither surprise nor expectation.

Tu Feng slightly acknowledged and then, alongside Tang Yuxian, left.

Once the room was left with just the three family members, Yang Yingfeng remarked, "I've heard of those two names; they are indeed said to be the two Blood Servants with the best talent in the Blood Servants Hall. If they withdraw from the Blood Servants Hall to retreat into seclusion because of this incident, it would be a loss for the Yang Family."

Throughout the years, only a single powerful Blood Servant had advanced to beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, now respected as the Yang Family's elder and holding substantial power.

Yang Kai gently shook his head. "To say something that you might not want to hear, I don't care about the Yang Family's losses or gains."

Yang Yingfeng chuckled in surprise. "I understand."

It was precisely because the family had too much status and the ties within were weak that each direct descendant would not have much sense of belonging upon returning. Otherwise, there wouldn't be such a struggle for succession.

"However, Kai’er, you’ve scored big this time," Yang Yingfeng said with a comforting smile, hinting at something.

Yang Kai nonchalantly nodded, "To some extent, yes. However, I still hope Tu Feng and Yuxian can follow me; it's because we are familiar with each other."

"What sort of gain is that? You two father and son really shouldn't speak in riddles," Dong Suzhu exclaimed, confused, "It looks like the son is the one at a disadvantage."

The two unnamed Blood Servants, severely injured, would be unable to provide assistance to Yang Kai for a while. Even if they recovered, they might not be as effective as Tu Feng and Tang Yuxian.

Yang Kai exchanged smiles with Fourth Master Yang, the former gradually standing. "You should talk it over with Mother. I need to make some preparations first; I must head to the elders' hall tomorrow."

"Go on." Yang Yingfeng waved his hand, watching Yang Kai's robust figure depart, feeling an odd sense of unreality.

He’s grown up, truly grown up! Whether in schemes or means, he seems to be much stronger than his own father. With all those miraculous things he possesses, it's truly unknown what he's been through these years.

Inside the room, Dong Suzhu was still pestering, suddenly swaying to sit on Fourth Master Yang's lap, tugging at his not-so-long beard while asking, "What has my son gained, exactly?"

Fourth Master Yang smiled gently and began to unravel the mystery for her.
