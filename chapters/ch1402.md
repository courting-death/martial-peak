## Chapter 1402 — Fish on the Cutting Board

Shi that bound him was broken, and Yang Kai instantly tore himself free from that invisible quagmire. Saint Yuan poured into the Purple Shield in his hand and he hurled it forward; the shield immediately burst, turning into a sweep of ochre sandstorm. Wind and sand roared up to blot out sky and earth, instantly wrapping the jet-black python that the opponent’s one-handed axe Secret Treasure had conjured.

A faint hissing issued from within; the python’s enormous bulk crashed left and right inside, but escaping was no simple matter. After all, the Purple Shield was of a markedly higher tier than the one-handed axe, and the sandstorm tucked within it was primarily defensive—containing that jet-black python was child’s play.

Secret Treasures do not fight on their own. The entanglement between the Purple Shield and the one-handed axe was entirely a clash of Divine Sense control between Yang Kai and Elder Du. It was a contest of Divine Sense strength and the subtlety of their Secret Treasures.

Elder Du’s face changed greatly; from this exchange he plainly realized Yang Kai not only possessed a foundation that in no way lagged behind his own, but his Divine Sense was astonishingly potent—already far beyond that of warriors at the same rank.

“What in heaven’s name are you?!” Elder Du cried out in shock. He simply refused to believe that some unaffiliated brat could possess such overwhelming strength. Not even Myriad Beasts Mountain’s most elite Saint King Realm disciples had such power—and even the Battle Sky Alliance or Leitai Sect couldn’t possibly have produced someone like this.

On Dark Star, the only place that could cultivate such a heaven-defying martial artist was Star Emperor Mountain!

Could this brat have come down from Star Emperor Mountain to temper himself? Recalling the bits of intelligence about Yang Kai, Elder Du’s heart pounded uneasily.

If it weren’t so, how could he possess such an endless stream of methods, forcing him into disadvantage at every turn?

“Enough of your nonsense!” Yang Kai had no intention of answering. He had been on the defensive earlier—not because his strength was lacking, but because this was the first time he’d crossed blades with a warrior of this calibre. Even with every advantage, he dared not be reckless. He had wanted to probe the other’s strength; now that the result was clear, he would shift from defense to offense.

As his words fell, a long sword wreathed in Demonic Flame materialized in his hand. The sword had been formed entirely from Saint Yuan, pitch-black and boundless, as if it could devour all light nearby. He raised the blade and struck hard forward.

A sword radiance over ten zhang long cleaved through the air like a rupturing rainbow, hurtling toward Elder Du.

Feeling the killing intent sewn into the radiance, Elder Du shrieked and hurriedly sidestepped; he hadn’t yet steadied his footing when another sword radiance swept through, as if the attacker cared nothing for the waste of Saint Yuan.

Panic-stricken, Elder Du bit down and drew from his Spatial Ring a small square shield. He spat a mouthful of blood onto it; the little shield spun, and as it rotated a seemingly solid shield phantom—the colour of burnished gold and covered with rune-like markings—sprang forth to block before him.

Every martial artist had at least one defensive Secret Treasure; Elder Du was no exception. Some attacks simply could not be met head-on.

That small square shield was his defensive Secret Treasure. Though only Origin-Grade Lower-Level in tier, it was the pinnacle work of the Origin-Grade artificer who served as Guest Elder to Myriad Beasts Mountain. Elder Du normally prized it too dearly to use in ordinary skirmishes.

Yet now he had no choice but to take it out.

Boom…

A tremendous sound rang out as the ten-odd zhang black sword radiance struck the shield face. The rune-swathed golden phantom wavered but held, steadfast as forged metal.

Elder Du’s body shuddered and he stumbled back a few paces, but his face brimmed with joy—his Secret Treasure had fully withstood the sword radiance, and he felt great satisfaction at its solidity.

Yet in the next instant that joy froze; his eyes widened in disbelief.

He watched as wave after wave of sword radiances, just like the first, flew over in succession—each over ten zhang long, jet-black as ink, rolling with scalding black flame, nearly half the sky consumed by their onslaught.

A chill ran through Elder Du’s heart.

Is this brat insane? Who throws Saint Yuan away like this in battle? Doesn’t he fear being left powerless afterward?

Warriors of every rank carefully rationed their strength in combat—no one could be certain whether a fight would become protracted. If one exhausted their Saint Yuan and the fight dragged on, they would be butchered.

Attack patterns like Yang Kai’s—recklessly charging as if life meant nothing—were rare. The few times Elder Du had seen such moves were by foes who, knowing they had no hope of survival, attempted a desperate, sacrificial struggle to drag others down. None had succeeded; all had been slain.

Was this brat truly intent on a mutual annihilation? Was he mad?

Such thoughts flickered and died. Having just taken a blow that shook his form, Elder Du had no time to think of anything else; he could only pour his Saint Yuan into the little shield and pray it would hold his line.

The golden shield phantom flared, radiance blinding to the eye.

In the next moments a thunderous clatter echoed as Elder Du was shoved back step by step. The sword radiances slammed into the shield, shattering and dissipating, but they came on endlessly, wave after wave, inexhaustible.

Crunch…

The crisp crack made Elder Du’s face go white. He looked and saw a hairline fissure running across the golden shield phantom; the tiny crack rapidly spidered outward until it formed a web of fractures.

No matter how sturdy, a defense cannot hold against ceaseless assault. Even the Protective Mountain Array of Dragon Lair Mountain would not escape that law—much less a mere Origin-Grade Lower-Level defensive little shield.

“No good!” Elder Du cried, flinging the shield forward and frantically withdrawing to the side.

At that crucial moment he had to abandon the little shield he treasured; it possessed none of the special capabilities contained within Yang Kai’s Purple Shield.

With a crash, bereft of his Saint Yuan the small shield was merely a lump of lifeless stuff. Yang Kai’s sword radiances struck it and smashed it to pieces; the fragments were immediately consumed by Demonic Flame and turned to ash. That brief blockage, however, granted Elder Du a reprieve—he flashed away to a distance of thirty zhang.

Yang Kai coldly watched the spot where he had stood. His left hand formed a gesture; with Saint Yuan surging, a pitch-black spear took shape.

“Go!” he breathed. The pitch-black spear trembled, vanished from its place, and when it reappeared it was above Elder Du’s head, slanting down in a stabbing descent.

The Heaven-Slaying Spear of the Nine Heavens Divine Technique—Yang Kai now wielded it with consummate skill and formidable might.

Elder Du had not yet recovered from the previous peril and now found himself in dire straits again. Enraged, he lifted both hands and shoved upward; visible Saint Yuan gushed forth to form a curtain of light above his head, perilously intercepting the Heaven-Slaying Spear’s lethal blow.

But it was not over. Energy churned in the void and a gigantic palm suddenly manifested, slamming down toward his skull; Elder Du’s eyelids twitched violently.

The palmprint blotted out sky and earth, seeming to seal all his avenues of escape, breeding a feeling of utter despair.

The Heaven-Covering Palm—one hand to cover the heavens!

With a thunderous boom the palm came down. The earth shuddered and a palm-sized imprint dozens of zhang across was stamped onto the ground; from above it looked exactly like a giant handprint.

Yang Kai, however, knitted his brows and suddenly turned his head to gaze not far off.

There, Elder Du was standing—when had he gotten there?—face ashen, coughing lightly, his Saint Yuan in terrible disarray.

Surprise and astonishment flickered across Yang Kai’s face.

He could not fathom what secret art the man had used to escape from beneath his layered measures. It seemed Second Stage of the Origin Returning Realm warriors truly could not be taken lightly.

“Brat, do you really want to go down with me?” Elder Du stared at Yang Kai with eyes full of venom and dread, his voice cold as he asked.

At this point he utterly dared not look down on Yang Kai. Even without the array’s suppression here, he admitted he could not guarantee killing Yang Kai—perhaps the two would be evenly matched.

And now, suppressed by the area’s strange array and unable to exert even seventy percent of his strength, he was no match. Aside from his initial assaults, he had spent the rest of the time dodging and looking thoroughly humiliated.

Especially that earlier escape—Elder Du’s skin crawled just thinking about it. If he hadn’t acted decisively and used a secret art that severely drained his power to flee, he would surely have been grievously wounded.

In a place like this, grievously wounded, the fate that awaited him needed no imagination.

But that secret art was not something to be used lightly; after this fight, whether he won or lost, several years of recuperation would be unavoidable.

Elder Du had already begun to sound the retreat. Treasure tempts the heart, but one must live to enjoy it. How to appease Elder Feng’s wrath was not his concern now—if he stayed any longer he would likely perish here.

“Go down together?” Yang Kai’s face took on a teasing expression as he sneered, “As if you could.”

The sarcasm and mockery in his words were plain. At any other time Elder Du would never let such an insult pass; he had never before been laughed at by a Saint King Realm warrior. But now…

“You think I’m already fish on the chopping board? Brat, I admit your strength is considerable, but I am not so easy to kill. Either we call it quits—you let me go and I will never set foot in Dragon Lair Mountain again—how about that?”

“Do you think you still have the right to bargain with me?” Yang Kai sneered darkly. “I’ll treat you as fish on the cutting board—so what?”
