## Chapter 135 — Escape

As fists and palms intertwined, a gentle hidden force surged into Yang Kai's body, coursing through his meridians. It slowed the operation of his Primordial Qi, making his arms feel as if they had turned soft under the influence of this Clear Wind Palm technique.

Nie Yong grinned maliciously, "Yang Kai, today I will cripple one of your arms as a small lesson for you!"

A fierce glint flashed across Yang Kai's face, and the Primordial Qi within him surged violently, resisting the invasion of the Clear Wind Palm, causing Nie Yong's intentions to fall flat in an instant.

"You still dare to resist!" Nie Yong gritted his teeth, feeling embarrassed that he couldn't take Yang Kai down in one move. He struck again, taunting, "Although your Primordial Qi is quite robust, your strength is too weak! Let’s see how you can withstand this!"

Once more, the gentle breeze swept toward him, but this time, within the strands of clear wind lay a hidden current, indicating that there was more to come.

Yang Kai no longer held back; the thirty-six meridians within him surged, showcasing the results of a day’s diligent training.

Flame Yang Explosion!

"I already told you, your strength is too weak!" Nie Yong sneered repeatedly. Before his words could finish, the gentle palm force suddenly transformed into a raging storm, crashing toward Yang Kai with the intent to truly cripple one of his arms.

At the same moment, Yang Kai's Flame Yang Explosion erupted.

With a thunderous roar, a burst of firelight flared up, illuminating the area within several zhang as bright as day, blinding everyone present.

"What?" Nie Yong was taken aback, shocked to discover that the hidden lethality of his Clear Wind Palm was matched by Yang Kai's seemingly ordinary punch. The two techniques clashed with astonishing similarity, resulting in a tie.

Two muffled grunts echoed as Nie Yong staggered backward, retreating over ten zhang before being stopped by a large tree. Unable to hold back, he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, suffering considerable injury.

Yang Kai was not faring any better. His strength was six or seven small levels lower than Nie Yong's, and relying on the power of martial techniques to counterattack was already a rare feat. With Nie Yong injured, how could he remain unscathed?

Yet he did not show any signs of weakness. After forcing Nie Yong back, the bones in his body crackled. A warm current surged through him, and his Primordial Qi stirred violently.

In a flurry of wind and thunder, he unleashed four punches in rapid succession, targeting the four individuals surrounding him. Four bursts of firelight erupted simultaneously, and the ferocious shockwaves and lethal force left everyone stunned.

These four individuals were even stronger than Nie Yong, and Yang Kai was hurriedly launching his attacks, so it was naturally impossible for him to injure them.

However, after they blocked his strikes, they found that Yang Kai had vanished from sight.

From a distance, Yang Kai's voice drifted over, "Nie Yong, we will meet again. I will take your life next time!"

His voice echoed, making it impossible to discern which direction he had fled.

"Junior Brother Nie!" one person quickly turned to look at Nie Yong, only to see blood spilling from the corner of his mouth, his eyes flashing with deep unwillingness and a hint of dread. His expression was not good.

"Are you alright?"

"I'm fine!" Nie Yong gritted his teeth and stood up. "Yang Kai is injured; we must chase him down. We cannot let him escape!"

"Chase him?" Someone hesitated, realizing that they had no enmity with Yang Kai. They had come here merely to support Nie Yong and put on a show for Jie Hongchen. Now that the person had fled, what was the point of pursuing him? In these lofty mountains, who knew what dangers lay within? If they encountered a powerful beast, wouldn’t they all be doomed?

Nie Yong sensed the change in the attitude of the four and quickly said, "You all saw the power of his martial technique, right? That was what he obtained a few days ago! With this martial technique, he was able to injure me. Are you not moved?"

Upon hearing this, the expressions of the Lingxiao Pavilion disciples brightened.

After a moment of hesitation, one of them said, "Then let’s chase, but let’s be clear: we are only after that martial technique. Whatever grudges you have with Yang Kai, you resolve them yourself. If you want to kill him or cripple him, you bear the consequences alone."

"That is natural!" Nie Yong's expression twisted with rage as he cursed, "How dare he threaten me! Who does he think he is to take my life? If I catch him, let’s see who takes whose life!"

With that, he led the charge, and the other four exchanged glances, all feeling that Yang Kai was likely doomed this time. If Nie Yong truly caught up to him, his life would surely be forfeit!

Nie Yong had already set his killing intent!

By the small lake where Lan Chudie and Du Yishuang had bathed earlier, Yang Kai finally could not hold back any longer and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Although he had narrowly escaped a calamity, the peril he faced during that brief encounter was something no one else could comprehend.

All five of those individuals were genuine Qi Movement Realm cultivators. The weakest, Nie Yong, was already at the fourth layer of Qi Movement, while the strongest was likely at the seventh or eighth layer.

They were not comparable to the enemies Yang Kai had encountered in the Jiuyin Valley. It could be said that any one of them was roughly equivalent to Wen Feichen after his cultivation was sealed.

If it weren't for the sudden burst of his Flame Yang Explosion, Yang Kai would have had no way to escape their encirclement.

Five punches, clashing with five different individuals, had forced five types of hidden forces into his body. Leaving aside the injuries he sustained, those five hidden forces coursing through his meridians hindered the operation of his Primordial Qi. If he did not quickly find a safe place to dispel this hidden force, it could leave lasting repercussions.

The pursuers were drawing closer, and Yang Kai bent down to bury the blood he had spat out, then dove into the lake.

He did not know if he would encounter danger in the forest, but in his current state, he would likely be powerless to defend himself if faced with any peril. Thus, he could only retrace his steps along the path he had taken; it was the safest route he knew.

The lake was also the best hiding place. If Nie Yong and the others dared not come down to investigate, that would be what Yang Kai wished for. If they did dare to come down, they would have to face his counterattack.

Holding his breath, Yang Kai submerged himself deeper into the lake, hiding in the darkness.

The lake was vast, but Yang Kai did not expect it to be so deep. He dove down for over ten zhang without reaching the bottom. Instead, the water below grew increasingly cold and piercing.

Not daring to swim any deeper, Yang Kai floated in the water, straining to listen to the sounds above.

Sure enough, moments later, Nie Yong and the others arrived at the lake's edge. Although Yang Kai had tried his best to conceal his tracks while fleeing, they had an instinctive awareness, especially with Nie Yong leading the group, who had been with Yang Kai for several days.

Voices could be heard at the lake's edge, and soon someone jumped in.

Yang Kai's expression darkened. He had not expected these people to be so decisive, or perhaps he had underestimated Nie Yong's hatred for him.

With no other choice, Yang Kai could only continue to dive deeper.

The surrounding lake water was icy cold, but fortunately, he practiced the True Yang Technique, and the warm True Yang Yuan Qi flowed throughout his body. This chill was not a problem.

The person who jumped into the lake swam around, searching for a while but found nothing. Not daring to venture too deep, he climbed back out.

After searching the area for a while, Nie Yong and the others finally left.

Yang Kai was running out of breath underwater, feeling dizzy. Although he had reached the seventh layer of the Open Origin Realm, his breath was still limited.

Now he was nearing his limit. If those people did not leave, things would become very troublesome.

Just as Yang Kai was about to swim up, a sudden whooshing sound reached his ears.

Upon hearing this noise, Yang Kai immediately became alert, turning his head to look around, but saw nothing.

Moments later, another whooshing sound came, sounding like the wind.

Strange, where was the wind coming from at the bottom of the lake?

With suspicion, Yang Kai followed the direction of the sound and scanned the area, his expression suddenly brightening. He then stirred the water and swam downward.

He discovered a dark hole at the bottom of the lake.

Approaching the hole and listening closely, he could indeed hear the sound of wind howling faintly coming from within.

Yang Kai's gaze flickered. He was certain that the other end of this black hole led to a dry space, and it was also an exit; otherwise, there would be no sound of wind.

After contemplating for a moment, Yang Kai dove in, swimming through the black hole.

Nie Yong and the others were surely still searching outside. If Yang Kai emerged now, even if he could escape for a moment, there was still a risk of being discovered. It was better to explore this black hole; if his guess was correct, it would provide a safe refuge.

This black hole was quite long, extending over a hundred zhang. It first descended, then turned into a straight passage, finally rising again. Just as Yang Kai was about to exhaust his breath, he finally surfaced.

Wiping the water from his face, Yang Kai turned to survey his surroundings and found that things were indeed as he had guessed: the black hole led to an open space.

This should be a cave. Yang Kai had noticed earlier that there was a peak beside the small lake, and the black hole at the bottom of the lake should connect to a cave within that peak. The wind blowing into the cave howled, and the sound traveled through the black hole to the lake bottom, which was why he had noticed it.

The cave was exceptionally dry, with some stalactites hanging from the ceiling, resembling long spears.

Leaping out of the water, Yang Kai searched the vicinity briefly, feeling much more at ease.

There were no traces of any living creatures here; it should be quite safe.

With his mind at ease, Yang Kai, feeling utterly exhausted, quickly sat cross-legged, circulating the True Yang Technique to dry his clothes and then began to dispel the hidden forces that had invaded his body from the five individuals.

Their strength was far superior to his, so Yang Kai could not dispel these hidden forces immediately. If he were facing an opponent of equal strength, he would not have to worry about such issues.

This was Yang Kai's advantage; his Primordial Qi was robust and pure. Even if hidden forces invaded, as long as he resolved them in time, there would be no hidden dangers. However, other Open Origin Realm cultivators at the seventh layer would have to wait for these hidden forces to erode their meridians.

Thus, in battles between martial artists, those with higher strength held absolute power over life and death.

After more than an hour, Yang Kai spat out a mouthful of black blood. With the expulsion of the black blood, the hidden dangers within him were completely resolved.

Though his complexion was somewhat pale, he no longer felt any obstruction within his meridians.

Clear Wind Palm!

Yang Kai recalled that when Nie Yong had launched his attack, someone had commented on the martial technique he used. The power of this technique was indeed considerable, especially with its subsequent transformations, akin to a raging storm, mirroring the changes in his Flame Yang Explosion.

However, the power of the Clear Wind Palm was still slightly inferior to the Flame Yang Explosion; otherwise, he would not have been able to engage in a mutually destructive confrontation with Nie Yong!
