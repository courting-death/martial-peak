## Chapter 2010 — Sudden Crisis

Yang Kai knew, of course, that Xiao Fu she mentioned was the Flying Heaven-and-Earth Bat that had guided him all the way here; that small creature’s instincts were keen, and along the way Yang Kai had relied on it to avoid many formations and traps.

If both a person and a beast possessed that sense, then it had to be right.

At once Yang Kai fell silent, and he and Mo Xiaoqi hid at a distance, stealthily observing.

From that vantage Yang Kai noticed something interesting: the martial artists hiding around and watching were not limited to him and Mo Xiaoqi—there were others who had deployed secret techniques to conceal their bodies and suppress their auras, some hidden in the void, some sheltered in unknown spots, all staring toward the front.

Over there, the dozens of Void King Realm cultivators who had been working to break the seal seemed to have been at it for quite some time; each looked heavily drained, and one by one they pulled out pills, stuffing them into their mouths and refining them to recover as they continued to pry at the formation.

With the inflow of power from those dozens, a cross-shaped symbol emitting a phosphorescent, flame-like glow gradually appeared at the center of their gathering.

A scorching force surged and rolled from that place.

“A Blazing Flame seal?” Mo Xiaoqi gave a soft, surprised exclamation when she saw it.

“You recognize it?” Yang Kai asked in a low voice.

Mo Xiaoqi nodded lightly. “I saw it in the records; it’s an ancient sealing technique, almost nobody uses it now. The principle is simple, but it requires tremendous strength to assist it—who knows what’s sealed beneath.”

“We’ll know soon enough.” Yang Kai replied.

Ten li ahead, when the Blazing Flame seal manifested, the dozens of cultivators who had been breaking it suddenly became excited; someone cried out, “Everyone, push harder—the formation is about to collapse, the treasure will soon appear!”

That shout completely stirred the cultivators’ fervor; like addicts on a stimulant, they forced their power outward, pouring it ceaselessly into the center.

As time passed, the Blazing Flame seal’s form grew ever more complete and distinct. With the massive influx of power, the seal seemed increasingly strained.

The Blazing Flame erupted into chaos, and the seal itself began to reverberate with crackling detonations.

Then, in a moment of distortion and transformation, the Blazing Flame trembled and abruptly contracted toward the center.

In the next instant, a thunderous boom rang out.

Countless flames burst outward, and the violent force whipped up heat waves and shock, sending the dozens of Void King Realm cultivators flying—fortunately, they had prepared and unleashed defensive Secret Treasures, so though they looked disheveled, none were injured.

“The formation’s broken!” someone shouted, voice full of delight.

Those remaining glanced forward, hearts stirred; where the formation had stood, the Blazing Flame seal was gone, replaced by a dark pit on the ground, seemingly bottomless.

The Void King Realm cultivators who had just steadied themselves could not restrain themselves—one after another they flashed forward at great speed toward the pit, vying to seize the treasure first.

Their thoughts coincided, and many rushed to the pit’s edge; they eyed one another and hostility flared. In an instant a fierce skirmish erupted around the pit.

They had only cooperated to break the formation; now that it was opened, there was no need to remain allies.

Even some who had been hiding in the shadows to watch sprang forth and charged toward the pit.

Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi remained motionless, and a few others of cautious mind also did not show themselves.

Not far ahead, light flared as Secret Treasures and Martial Skills revealed their power, and fighters were injured and fell.

In the chaos a few sped into the pit; seeing this, others abandoned their opponents and followed in pursuit.

In a short time, only a few blood-mad fighters remained above the pit; the rest had all plunged in.

“This is getting lively.” Suddenly a voice sounded not far from where Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi hid.

Yang Kai was jolted—though he had been watching the pit, he had not relaxed his vigilance about his surroundings, and he had not noticed anyone approach until the voice made him alert.

He turned his head and his eyes narrowed involuntarily.

About some dozen zhang to his right stood a shabby, lecherous-looking old man with a scraggly goat-like beard; at some point he had appeared there, one hand behind his back, the other stroking his whiskers, squinting at the scene ahead.

“Men die for wealth and birds perish for food—what’s there to fret about?” the old man suddenly muttered under his breath, wearing an air of unfathomable profundity. For an instant his shabby guise seemed to fall away, and he took on a strangely ethereal, otherworldly bearing that greatly surprised Yang Kai.

“It’s that old fraud!” Mo Xiaoqi also recognized him; upon seeing his face she flew into a rage and, in an instant, was about to reveal herself to teach that trickster a lesson.

Yang Kai waved a hand to stop her.

Mo Xiaoqi, not knowing why Yang Kai restrained her, nonetheless obeyed and nodded.

At that moment the goat-bearded old man floated forward a step; with a blur he arrived tens of zhang away, then crouched and looked at a Void King Realm cultivator before him who had lost limbs and was howling in agony.

That cultivator had been grievously wounded in the melee; half his limbs had been hacked away. He had barely escaped with his life and collapsed, bleeding like a fountain—truly a grisly sight.

“Brother, you’re badly wounded!” the goat-bearded elder stared at him, wearing an expression of sorrowful pity, as if some compassionate immortal had descended to ease his suffering.

“Old… sir, save me!” the cultivator reached with his remaining arm and desperately grabbed toward the old man, pleading painfully.

“To save a life is worth more than building seven levels of pagoda; I cannot ignore this.” The old man said, and mysteriously produced a pill from his Spatial Ring. “This limb loss is not easy to treat; if handled poorly he will be a cripple for life. Fortunately… I have an ancestral Spiritual Pill, a Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill, capable of restoring flesh to bone and reviving the dead. I’ll sell it to you cheap since I think fate has brought us together!”

The cultivator’s eyes lit up as if he had seen a life-raft in drowning waters. He nodded frantically, “I’ll buy it—how many Source Crystals?”

“Not expensive—just give me your Spatial Ring.” The old man smiled broadly.

With no further words he shoved the Nine-Turn Rebirth Pill into the cultivator’s mouth and unceremoniously took the Spatial Ring from his hand.

Before the cultivator could react the deal was done; enraged, he rolled his eyes and fainted.

“Sleep, sleep, sleep well; when you wake, everything will be fine.” The old man grinned, murmuring like a spell, showing a mouth of yellow teeth.

“Eldest Brother Yang, look at this old rascal—he’s begun robbing people outright, how despicable!” Mo Xiaoqi was righteously indignant.

She and Yang Kai watched from the shadows and saw the old man’s deeds.

They had assumed he was merely a swindler, but now it seemed he not only liked to cheat—he even resorted to robbery, which Mo Xiaoqi could not tolerate.

“Indeed outrageous,” Yang Kai said soberly.

“I’ll go teach him a lesson!” Mo Xiaoqi cried, about to reveal herself.

But before she could act, the ground suddenly shook and a rumbling rolled from beneath as if distant thunder had passed.

Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi’s faces changed; before they could discern what had happened, streams of light shot frantically out of the pit ten li away.

It was the cultivators who had rushed in earlier to seize the treasure.

Dozens had entered the pit, but only half returned alive; each bore wounds and wore frightened expressions as if they had seen ghosts.

After emerging from the pit they fled wildly, running madly outward.

In the blink of an eye many disappeared from Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi’s sight.

“What’s happening underground?” Mo Xiaoqi cried.

“This is bad—let’s go!” Yang Kai decided immediately and started to leave; through his perception he sensed a powerful life fluctuation below stirring awake.

Its speed was astonishing, and its strength made him feel it was not something to contend with.

Crack… crack…

The ground suddenly began to fracture; in the blink of an eye, centering on that pit, the ground for dozens of li in every direction was cross-cut with large and small fissures.

That was not all—greenish vines sprouted up from the cracks.

Those vines seemed living, twisting and writhing as they grew wildly; in moments the area for dozens of li resembled a demon throng, a terrifying sight.

Yang Kai and Mo Xiaoqi leaped into the air.

At the instant they moved, a vine the thickness of an arm suddenly thrust up from beneath, its tip sharp as a sword; a single stab pierced the spot where they had just stood.

Had their movement been any slower they would have been trapped in a desperate fight.

“Ah—” a scream rang out; Yang Kai’s heart jumped as he turned and saw, not far off, a cultivator who had been hiding in the void impaled through the chest by a sharp vine, hanging in midair.

That cultivator was also of the Void King Realm, but no matter how he struggled he could not free himself from the vines’ grasp.

In the blink of an eye more vines enveloped and bound him tightly.
