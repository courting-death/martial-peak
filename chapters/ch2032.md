## Chapter 2032 — Liu Yan Appears

When Yang Kai returned to the side chamber, it seemed another auction lot had just been settled; he had no idea who had bought it.

"Has the finale Dao Origin Fruit not been brought out yet?" Yang Kai asked in astonishment after taking his seat.

Kang Siran shook his head and gave a wry smile. "There are a great many lots this time, but it should appear soon."

Yang Kai nodded lightly and fell silent, fixing his gaze on the elevated stage.

On the stage, the Drunken Old Man broke into a mysterious smile again, glanced around, and announced in a loud voice, "The next item to be displayed is extraordinary and extremely rare. It was not originally prepared for this auction but was submitted at the last minute by a friend present. Though this bends the rules, after the City Lord's appraisal it was deemed worthy of auction, so I permitted it. Heh heh — those among you who practice fire-type methods or possess fire-type secret treasures should pay attention."

As he spoke, he motioned to the rear, and a maid appeared carrying a round bowl in both hands and brought it up onto the stage.

The crowd's eyes all turned to the round bowl in curiosity; those who practiced fire-type arts or owned fire-type secret treasures in particular showed keen interest.

The round bowl bore the look of a restraining secret treasure, its surface flickering with sealing lights, and tiny rune marks the size of rice grains drifted across it like living fish.

Most of the cultivators present had keen sight; they quickly realized the auctioned item was not the bowl itself but whatever lay sealed inside it.

"Interesting — I wonder what exactly is sealed within," Kang Siran said with a faint smile, focusing his attention.

At the moment that bowl appeared, Yang Kai's brow tightened.

For some reason he felt a strange, faint mental connection coming from within the bowl, as if something inside was linked to his mind; the many sealing forces on the bowl, however, rendered that connection almost imperceptible — only the waves of unease and agitation in his heart made him certain of it.

He sent out his Divine Sense to probe, but the sealing forces blocked him from discerning the interior; he did not dare force it and could only frown in frustration.

"Pillmaster Yang, do you know what is inside?" Kang Siran asked oddly, seeing Yang Kai's expression.

Yang Kai shook his head reflexively, but his gaze remained locked on the round bowl.

At that moment the Drunken Old Man on stage began to explain, "This auction item was deposited by a Dao Origin Realm friend. That friend cultivates water-type methods, which are countered by this item, so he had no choice but to part with it — otherwise he would not have brought it here."

"Deputy City Lord, don't keep us in suspense — that's not like you," an impatient cultivator in the audience urged.

The Drunken Old Man chuckled, then recounted, "Indeed, it's time to tell. A few months ago in Fenglin City there were rumors that Yuqing Mountain harbored a fire-type artifact spirit, which drew many cultivators to investigate. It was finally confirmed not to be an ordinary artifact spirit but a descendant of a Luan Feng. Our cultivators in Fenglin City fought desperately for that descendant and suffered heavy casualties, yet none prevailed. In the end the Divine Spirit Luan Feng manifested, and with a single breath it unleashed a World-Ending Black Flame — Yuqing Mountain still burns to this day. The might of that Divine Spirit was truly terrifying."

He sighed long and deep, as if he had witnessed that world-ending flame with his own eyes.

"Deputy City Lord, could the auction item this time… actually be a Divine Spirit descendant?" the crowd excitedly speculated.

Many shared that thought; in an instant several cultivators' breaths quickened and their eyes burned as they stared at the bowl.

The Drunken Old Man snorted, "A Divine Spirit descendant? You have some nerve. If one truly stood before us, don't talk about whether you'd dare bid — even Fenglin City wouldn't dare put it up for auction. Offend a Divine Spirit and Yuqing Mountain's fate would be ours; the city would be razed and its people ruined. Who would be willing to shoulder that responsibility?"

At those words many shivered; on reflection it made sense — who in the world would be bold enough to bring a Divine Spirit descendant to auction? It would be a death sentence.

"But Deputy City Lord, what you said earlier…"

The Drunken Old Man curled his lips and said, "You're missing the point — it's not the Divine Spirit descendant, it's that fire-type artifact spirit! I don't know how you lot heard it wrong. Fine, then; I'll let you see what this auction item truly is."

Saying so, he formed a hand seal and struck the round bowl; with the sealing runes flashing, a clear bird cry suddenly rang from inside the bowl and a streak of fiery red light shot out.

A sudden whoosh rang out.

On the high stage, a strange bird suddenly appeared, roughly two zhang in length, its entire body wreathed in living flame. It looked at once like a Divine Spirit phoenix and yet not the same — braided through the blazing fire were flashes of violet lightning that flickered and danced.

This strange bird possessed both thunder and fire powers.

Moreover, the aura emanating from it was formidable — it was already at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm; its flame-forged body was noble and majestic, its wings full and exquisitely beautiful.

It reared its head and gave a long cry that carried stubbornness, fury, and defiance.

"Liu Yan!"

In Private Room B-9 Yang Kai sprang to his feet, his eyes contracting and a shocked cry escaping him.

"Master Yang?" Kang Siran looked at Yang Kai with a puzzled expression, not understanding such a sudden reaction, but upon seeing Yang Kai's mix of joy and anger he quickly understood.

Yang Kai had never expected to encounter Liu Yan again under such circumstances.

That day in the Starlight Passage he and his two chief allies had been separated from Chairman Ai Ou, Lady Chi Yue, and the others; their current whereabouts remained unknown.

Leaving Chairman Ai Ou and Lady Chi Yue aside, Yang Kai had always worried about Xiaoxiao and Liu Yan: one was a stone puppet with limited sentience, the other an artifact spirit; if either were discovered by a formidable expert they would certainly face danger — especially Liu Yan, whose appeal to those who practiced fire-type methods or owned fire-type secret treasures was enormous.

If Liu Yan's artifact-spirit body were absorbed by a fire-type practitioner, that practitioner would grow markedly stronger; if fused into a fire-type secret treasure, that treasure could be elevated by a full tier.

Whatever Yang Kai feared seemed to come true — Liu Yan had indeed been captured by a powerful expert and consigned to this auction. It would inevitably trigger fierce competition among many cultivators.

Fortunately Yang Kai was present at the auction, still able to maneuver; it was a small mercy amidst the misfortune.

No wonder he had felt that mental link when the round bowl was first brought out.

Back when Liu Yan had little sentience, Yang Kai had once performed rites upon her original body, so a permanent mental connection remained between them.

The instant Yang Kai rose, Liu Yan on the stage seemed to sense him and turned her fiery eyes toward Private Room B-9 where he sat; her shrill cry grew louder and she beat her wings in an effort to fly to him.

The Drunken Old Man simply changed his hand seal and a chain-like sealing force suddenly appeared on Liu Yan, binding her wings and forcing her heavily back down.

"Stop!" Yang Kai roared in anger when he saw this.

Yet as soon as the words left his mouth he realized how rash he had been; although Liu Yan originally belonged to him, she had been seized and turned into an auction lot.

He had no standing to demand the Drunken Old Man show mercy; acting too conspicuously might reveal something about him.

With that thought he drew a deep breath and said calmly, "Deputy City Lord, please be cautious. I am very interested in this artifact spirit — do not harm it."

The Drunken Old Man was of even temper; hearing this he glanced toward Yang Kai, chuckled, and said, "Rest assured, I know my limits — I would never truly harm it. Yes, as you can see, the item for auction is this fire-type artifact spirit. It is no ordinary spirit; it has awakened sentience and its intelligence is not low. If absorbed or fused into one's treasure it would be extremely useful."

On the stage the Drunken Old Man hyped Liu Yan's merits vigorously, detailing her unusual qualities and speaking grandly, which drew even more interest from the crowd.

In the side chamber Yang Kai sat back down, his expression dark.

In the present situation, if he wanted to retrieve Liu Yan he could only do so by bidding, unless he possessed Emperor Realm power and could seize her by force, ignoring the thousands of Void King Realm cultivators and the scores of Dao Origin-Grade experts present.

The latter option was impossible. Though Yang Kai had reached the Third Stage of the Void King Realm and carried several Imperial Treasures, acting here would be tantamount to courting death.

But he did not have nearly enough Source Crystals to win Liu Yan via bidding.

For a long moment his heart burned with anxiety.

Kang Siran appeared to catch a hint of the situation; after a brief silence he asked in a low voice, "Master Yang, do you have some connection with that artifact spirit?"

Yang Kai nodded. "Since Shopkeeper Kang has noticed, I won't hide it. Her name is Liu Yan — she was originally my artifact spirit."

"Ah? Master Yang's artifact spirit?" Kang Siran was taken aback despite having suspected as much.

"She's not merely an artifact spirit — to me, she's also a friend."

"A friend…" Kang Siran stared at Yang Kai in astonishment, his mind baffled; in his view, who would ever consider an artifact spirit a friend?
