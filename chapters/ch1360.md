## Chapter 1360 — Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness Defense

Four days ago? Yang Kai raised an eyebrow — wasn't four days ago the day the Fallen Emperor Mountains experienced that anomaly and the Imperial Garden burst into being? Why, then, did Yang Yan happen to collapse at precisely that time?

What connection could there be between the two? He pondered for a moment, then shook his head with a rueful smile, feeling his own idea absurdly far-fetched.

The Fallen Emperor Mountains and the Imperial Garden were both things connected to the Starry Sky Emperor; they had nothing to do with Yang Yan, so how could they possibly be implicated?

"Yang Kai, what’s wrong with her?" Wu Yi asked with worry, concern plain on her pretty face.

"I don't know." Yang Kai looked up at her. "Did Guest Elder Chang and Guest Elder Hao come to investigate?"

"Yes, but even those two Guest Elders were at a loss. Should we send her to the Medicine Pill Sect to have their people take a look?" Wu Yi bit her thin lip and offered the suggestion. Although the Medicine Pill Sect was famed for pill-refining on Dark Star, its understanding of medicinal arts was exceptional; sending Yang Yan there might reveal some clues.

It was an idea she had had earlier, only Yang Kai had been away and she couldn't act on it without his say-so.

"No." Yang Kai shook his head. "Putting aside the delay in time, even if we sent her there we might not be able to persuade an elder-level figure to intervene."

“What should we do then?” Wu Yi was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan. Among everyone at Dragon Lair Mountain, Yang Kai was like a dragon whose head could be seen but not its tail—often in seclusion or away on adventures—so she had grown closest to Yang Yan. Now, seeing Yang Yan suffer such a calamity while she herself could do nothing, she was naturally frantic with worry.

"Don't panic. I'll see if I can find the cause." Yang Kai comforted them and explained casually, "I just did a brief probe — her bodily functions seem fine, but since she's unconscious the cause must lie in her Sea of Consciousness. If I can break into it and take a look, I'll know what's wrong."

"Be careful then. Don't injure her."

"I understand. You two go outside first." Yang Kai waved his hand.

Wu Yi and Qian Yue exchanged a worried glance, then left the room together.

In the blink of an eye only Yang Kai and Yang Yan remained. He glanced at the pale woman lying on the bed. Yang Kai sighed, helped her up, set her cross-legged facing him, and then slowly extended a finger to touch her smooth forehead.

Immediately Yang Kai closed his eyes. His Divine Sense force surged forth and flowed into Yang Yan.

Yang Yan was now unconscious. Her Sea of Consciousness had sealed itself; to enter it he would have to break through its defenses. That risked harming her, but Yang Kai trusted his methods and did not worry.

After all, years of nourishment from the Warm Spirit Lotus had made his Divine Sense cultivation far exceed what his realm should allow.

In the next instant Yang Kai's Spirit Body slipped free of his shell and came directly before a barrier — Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness defenses. Seeing it, Yang Kai was moved; even in unconsciousness her defenses were formidable, like a thick, impregnable city wall standing before him, preventing him from taking another step.

Moreover, runes flowed across that wall, giving it an air that was far from to be trifled with.

Yang Kai furrowed his brow; he realized he had underestimated Yang Yan's ability. Since first meeting her he had never been able to gauge her true cultivation, and had never asked directly. He had thought some special Secret Treasure she carried blocked prying eyes, but now it seemed her true realm was far higher than he had imagined.

A truly enigmatic woman! Rather than being alarmed, Yang Kai felt delighted. Staring at that heavy barrier he smiled faintly, then unleashed a powerful Spirit attack with his Divine Sense at the barrier.

The runes on the wall flickered once, and Yang Kai's attack sank away like a stone in the sea — vanished without a trace.

Yang Kai's face turned slightly stern; he increased the power of his assault and hammered the barrier repeatedly, cautious the whole time — he had to ensure his attack was effective while also controlling its force so as not to injure Yang Yan when the barrier finally broke.

The effort was more arduous than he could express.

The runes on the wall kept flaring; strange sigils leapt from the ramparts to intercept and nullify his Divine Sense strikes.

But Yang Yan was unconscious, and though her self-generated Sea of Consciousness defense was strong, it could not withstand Yang Kai's sustained assault. After a full hour he finally tore a gap in that wall-like barrier.

Seeing the breach, Yang Kai's face brightened. He was about to force his way into Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness when three rays of light suddenly shot out from the gap.

One gleamed violet, one pure white, and one blue as the sky.

Yang Kai's eyelids constricted; instinct told him great danger was coming. If he did not withdraw his Spirit Body, disaster would befall him in the next instant, and he hastily retreated.

When he took another look he was dumbstruck.

The three lights were actually three Secret Treasures of differing forms.

The violet one resembled a dagger that twisted and warped into the shape of a fang-serpent, constantly snapping and swallowing in a ferocious manner as it lunged at Yang Kai.

The pure white item looked like a ring carved from white jade, changing size and emitting a terrifying binding force from within.

The final azure light was emitted from a seal-shaped Secret Treasure. When that blue radiance swept across Yang Kai’s Spirit Body, he felt as though he were a snowflake laid bare beneath the blazing sun—on the verge of melting away. His Soul Force began to dissolve at an astonishing speed.

Yang Kai's expression darkened.

He had known Yang Yan was an affluent artificer, but had not expected her Sea of Consciousness to harbor three Divine Soul Secret Treasures of such tremendous power.

And from the way those three Secret Treasures functioned, they were clearly autonomous defensive devices.

This was trouble indeed; Yang Kai's face soured.

Although he had torn Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness defense, if he could not stop the attacks of those three Divine Soul Secret Treasures he could not storm in and see what lay within.

Judging from their powers, stopping them would not be simple. If he engaged them directly, either he would be injured or Yang Yan would be harmed — neither outcome was acceptable.

His face cold as water, Yang Kai's Spirit Body hovered before Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness defense and he dared not act rashly.

During this delay the breach in Yang Yan's defense began to mend on its own; before long it would be restored to its original state.

When that happened Yang Kai's earlier efforts would be for naught.

As the gap snapped shut at great speed and the three Divine Soul Secret Treasures watched like predators ready to strike should he advance, Yang Kai's eyes darted and he suddenly thought of a plan.

He sent a thread of Divine Sense mixed with his call, slipping silently through the gap and into Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness.

Immediately he watched anxiously.

To his disappointment Yang Yan's defensive perception continued repairing and restored itself within a blink; she seemed as if she had not heard the call at all.

Just as Yang Kai sighed and prepared to abandon the attempt, the wall-like Sea of Consciousness defense spontaneously split open a seam, and the three Secret Treasures zipped back through that fissure.

Yang Kai watched for a moment and realized the seam showed no sign of closing further. Overjoyed, he flashed forward and plunged through into Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness.

Yang Yan had indeed heard his call — which was why she had briefly relaxed her defenses and allowed him entry.

Yang Kai had only tried on a whim and had succeeded. It seemed Yang Yan was not entirely senseless; her soul was immersed in her Sea of Consciousness and simply unresponsive to the outside world.

Inside Yang Yan's Sea of Consciousness Yang Kai stood suspended in midair, staring about in surprise.

He found her Sea of Consciousness resembled his own: the roiling waters below were flame-shaped and blisteringly hot, even the sky above was crimson, making the place feel like a realm of fire.

Divine Sense Fire!

The last time Yang Kai had returned from the Flowing Flame Sandland he had brought back nine Flowing Flame Fireblazes and given several to Yang Yan. Those Fireblazes could alter a martial artist's Divine Sense; after giving them to her he had never asked whether they had taken.

Now it seemed Yang Yan had indeed succeeded. Her Divine Sense Fire was not far behind his own in potency; even if slightly weaker, it was only a matter of time before it grew.

After all, Yang Kai's Divine Sense Fire had been born long before hers.

Within the flame-rolling Sea of Consciousness bubbles floated serenely, each containing something—her life's experiences, memories, and learned things.

Yang Kai, of course, wouldn't be so bored as to pry into Yang Yan's past, but many of those bubbles exuded a special profundity that greatly surprised him.

His own Sea of Consciousness did not possess that same mysterious aura.

Shaking off the curiosity and suppressing his doubts, Yang Kai looked toward a spot in the sky and hastened in that direction.

High above the Sea of Consciousness, a figure curled up like a child, arms hugging her knees, long hair reaching to her hips, enveloped by a layer of strange transparent energy.

It was Yang Yan's Spirit Body!

She lay there like a fetus in its mother's womb, appearing fragile; her eyes tightly shut and her lashes trembling.

Seeing this, an inexplicable pity welled in Yang Kai, tightening his brow. Although Yang Yan's Spirit Body was almost threadbare, every part of her was exposed to his gaze and yet he felt no lecherous thought—only the urge to pluck her out of this place and rouse her filled his heart.
