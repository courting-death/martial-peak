## Chapter 775 — Sand Sea

The Sand Sea by day scorched without mercy; by night it chilled to the bone.

Beneath the full moon, visible waves of cold seeped up from the grains of sand like vengeful spirits, carrying a chill that pierced to the marrow.

Looking out, the whole sea of sand seemed glazed with a thin sheet of ice, crystalline and translucent; moonlight slanted down and was reflected back, making everything appear breathtakingly beautiful.

At one spot on the Sand Sea, An Ling'er held Yang Kai close, True Yuan surging as she used her body heat to warm his gradually cooling frame.

Yang Kai seemed truly dead; since fleeing the Small Xuan Realm in daylight he had not moved once. At first there had been a little warmth and a faint heartbeat, but over time his body grew colder and the life within him dwindled, like a candle in wind, liable to be snuffed out at any moment.

An Ling'er guarded him with utmost care, not leaving his side for an inch.

This was the future master of the Sacred Land—An Ling'er, even if she died she would not allow him to be harmed; on her beautiful face was a firmness and an unexpected steel.

Rustle, rustle...

A sound came from nearby; An Ling'er suddenly looked up and saw Gou Chi returning from his scouting. Even one as robust as he found the night in the Sand Sea hard to bear; he ran back shivering, his hair rimed with ice shards.

A flicker of wariness passed through An Ling'er's eyes. When Yang Kai had been unharmed she had dealt with Gou Chi more often and knew this demon to be a lecherous rogue; now that Yang Kai's life hung in the balance she felt she must keep an eye on him.

But when she recalled that his True Yuan and Divine Sense had both been bound by restrictions, she relaxed somewhat.

"How is he?" Gou Chi hurried over and asked anxiously.

An Ling'er shook her head slowly.

"It looks like there’s no saving him."

"Don't say that—he's still alive!" An Ling'er snapped, her almond-shaped eyes wide with anger.

"Alright, alright, I won't say it, but nothing is certain—it's best you brace yourself. Ah… poor Yang, what a rotten fate." Gou Chi heaved a sigh. Seeing Yang Kai suffer while helping them escape had softened his tone into something more affectionate; "If he survives it'd be wonderful—I wanted to take him to Qingliao City and treat him proper."

He sat down on the sand, wearing a face of sorrow, then suddenly chuckled low: "You humans are amusing; I've caught plenty before, and almost all of them, when faced with danger, drop to their knees and beg—how ugly. Yang, though, he has backbone; like us demons he has fighter's blood, would rather die than submit—that's a real man."

Gou Chi's boasting drew An Ling'er's attention and she cast him a sidelong glance. Quietly she asked, "Those humans you captured—where did you take them?"

Gou Chi made a casual chopping-down gesture. An Ling'er's face went dark and she turned away, refusing to speak to him.

The Sand Sea at night was eerily silent; only scorpion-like creatures scuttled through the sand. Gou Chi casually seized a few and devoured them with relish, the crunching noises loud in the stillness.

He ate while commenting as if tasting a rare delicacy.

In the latter half of the night the Sand Sea grew even colder.

Yang Kai's last vestige of life was rapidly being extinguished; realizing this, both An Ling'er and Gou Chi could not help but clutch their hearts and watch him with worried attention.

Within no more than half an hour that faint life suddenly vanished.

An Ling'er's beautiful eyes went blank in an instant and her delicate body trembled uncontrollably.

Gou Chi also heaved a heavy sigh, lamenting that heavens were jealous of talent.

While the two were steeped in sorrow, a surge of roaring vitality burst forth from Yang Kai's body as if stoked by raging flames; the once-icy corpse heated rapidly, True Yuan coursed furiously through his meridians with a rushing sound.

Huu—

With a light noise, Yang Kai seemed to ignite; the True Yuan pouring from his body wrapped him, melting the sand nearby into lava.

An Ling'er was startled and scrambled aside; even so she was nearly scorched.

Gou Chi stared in disbelief; a scorpion tail he'd been nibbling quietly slid from the corner of his mouth.

With a sudden sound Yang Kai spat a dark mist of blood; the True Yuan that had erupted hastily retracted. He pushed himself up, eyes dazed as he scanned the surroundings; only after seeing the stunned looks on An Ling'er's and Gou Chi's faces did he let out a heavy breath and slowly draw in his vigilant Divine Sense.

He sat down, regulating his heartbeat and breath. Images of the moments before his blackout flowed through his mind like a stream, and he soon understood what had happened.

His body was intact, but his Sea of Consciousness stabbed unbearably; Yang Kai groaned, clutching his head as his frame convulsed.

It took some time before he steadied, though the pain in his mind had not lessened.

"Where is this?" Yang Kai asked softly, lifting his head; his features were twisted by the sharp pain, a grim sight.

"The Sand Sea of the Demon Domain," Gou Chi replied after a pause, then asked with concern, "Yang, are you dead or alive now?"

Yang Kai raised his eyelids and gave him a weak look. "What do you think?"

"Ha!" Gou Chi laughed, "I knew you weren't so easy to kill."

"Who just said he was beyond saving?" An Ling'er shot him a cold glance.

Gou Chi's face went sheepish and he fell silent.

"How are you feeling now?" An Ling'er asked anxiously, turning to Yang Kai.

"Not great." Yang Kai shook his head; his soul still churned wildly and remained extremely unstable.

"Then rest right away."

Yang Kai nodded faintly and ceased speaking. He seated himself cross-legged, calmed his mind, and sent his Spirit Body into his Sea of Consciousness to examine it.

His Sea of Consciousness was desolate; the once-burning sea of water stored there had nearly dried up—an unmistakable sign that his Divine Sense had been overdrawn.

Inside that world everything was chaotic: sudden gales, flashes of lightning and thunder—as if it had reached its limit and stood on the verge of collapse.

Yang Kai knew the cause: it was entirely because he had stored the Divine Tree inside the Black Book Space.

He had never imagined that such an action would send him to death's door and nearly cost him his life.

Previously what he placed into the Black Book Space had all been very small—at most a hundredth the size of the Divine Tree—so even if his Divine Sense was drained a little, it wasn't much.

But this time his Divine Sense was outright exhausted when he put the Divine Tree into the Black Book Space; he had been completely spent in an instant.

The Divine Tree was different from anything he'd stored before. Not only was it enormous in size, it pulsed with incomprehensible power; such a cost was understandable.

Still, it was worth it!

Being able to take the Divine Tree with him, Yang Kai felt that even a more terrible price would have been worthwhile—this way he need not worry about failing to keep his promise to the Divine Tree.

Yang Kai was, after all, a man of his word.

The Divine Sense he had lost could be restored through cultivation; with the aid of the Warm Spirit Lotus it would not take long before his Divine Sense returned to its peak.

Moreover, the Warm Spirit Lotus had played an indispensable role in the affair—had it not sheltered his soul from being extinguished, Yang Kai would very likely have been dead.

At the thought Yang Kai felt relieved.

His Spirit Body withdrew from the Sea of Consciousness and then slipped into the Black Book Space. No sooner had he entered than the blaze of gold nearly blinded him.

The Divine Tree now stood within; its roots and branches were like refined gold, emitting a bright radiance that bathed the Black Book Space in resplendent light.

The scorching breath emanating from it eased much of Yang Kai's pain, a warm and extremely comfortable sensation.

Sensing his arrival, the tree's branches swayed and from its heart came waves of calling divine thought.

Yang Kai smiled faintly and his Spirit Body plunged into the heart of the tree. Its soul immediately entwined around him.

It seemed to know he was weak and, unlike before, did not recklessly drag his soul about; instead it wrapped him gently.

Powerful streams of energy poured from its soul, swiftly replenishing his parched Divine Sense.

Yang Kai received them with delight and made no attempt to stop it, luxuriating as the Divine Tree worked its ministrations.

In barely an hour Yang Kai had shed his previous frailty and stood revitalized; his dry Sea of Consciousness was once more full and brimming.

All his hidden injuries were healed.

After conversing with the Divine Tree for a while and informing it that he might need to remain in this space briefly, he received its response and then left, promising to come visit whenever he had time.

The Divine Tree was reluctant but did not stop him.

Opening his eyes again, the darkness had receded and daylight had returned.

Frowning and pondering, Yang Kai breathed out softly. He estimated that before reaching the Saint Realm it would be perilous to extract the Divine Tree from the Black Book Space; only upon attaining the Saint Realm could he do so unharmed.

He was in no hurry, however. Being in the Demon Domain, even if he took the tree out there was nowhere suitable to place it.

He would need to find it a safe home—Tianxiao Sect's Qixiu Peak would be a fine choice.

Seeing Yang Kai open his eyes, Gou Chi and An Ling'er, who had kept watch through the night, relaxed their expressions.

"Brother, how come you recovered so completely so quickly?" Gou Chi asked, puzzled; just over an hour earlier Yang Kai had been half-dead—no matter how fast recovery could be, it shouldn't be so sudden, and Gou Chi had not seen him take any pill.

"Really strange."
