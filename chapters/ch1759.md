## Chapter 1759 — Everlasting Tree

"Eh..." The man paused for a moment, then suddenly seemed to notice something; his gaze turned toward the chasm below and his Divine Sense swept over it. After a long moment he laughed out loud, "There's actually something like this. I don't know what you are, but you are useful to this old man. Very well—I'll take you for now."

Saying that, he leapt straight into the subterranean chasm.

As he fell leisurely, countless little black shadows surged out from the cracks in all directions, baring fangs and claws as they lunged at him.

He remained unafraid, instead letting out an excited roar: "Ha ha, come on, come on."

As he spoke, he suddenly produced a pitch-black great banner; from it erupted shrieks like ghosts and wolves wailing, the shrill sounds drowning out the tones of the underground black shadows. Upon the black banner many contorted human faces struggled, their features twisting as they howled.

He formed a hand-seal, poured Saint Yuan into the banner, and uttered in a low voice, "Go!"

In the next instant the black banner transformed into a sky-covering dark curtain and shrouded downward; every little black shadow that had leapt forward seemed to meet its nemesis and was swallowed up by the banner.

And as it devoured them, the aura exuded by the black banner grew ever stronger, its color growing ever blacker.

It seemed capable of devouring everything—even light itself.

The banner's horrific devouring threw those black shadows into panic; before long they began to fuse and grow, attempting to unite to resist the banner just as Yang Kai and the others had when fleeing earlier.

Seeing this, the Void King Realm expert wrapped in black qi did not show fear but rather excitement, murmuring, "It even has this ability—good, good, my Ten Thousand Souls Banner will be greatly improved, ha ha ha!"

He laughed, pointed his hand, and the sky-darkening curtain below suddenly writhed and twisted, then manifested into a large and terrifying human face. The face was hideous, studded with countless eyes, each refracting dazzling divine light that contained unfathomable potency.

Moreover, on that face was a gaping, blood-filled maw that issued brutal and sinister roars.

The mouth opened, larger even than the face itself, and bit savagely at the human-shaped black shadow gathered beneath.

The enormous black shadow, fused from countless little shadows, was not going to die quietly; its two pitch-black, whip-like hands lashed out, trying to ward off the Ten Thousand Souls Banner's attack.

In an instant, sand and stone flew in the subterranean chasm, chaos everywhere.

But it was all in vain.

The Ten Thousand Souls Banner feared none of the giant shadow's attacks; it bore the blows, lunged in, and swallowed the huge shadow in one bite. Then it tossed its head back like a bird feeding, consuming it whole.

Faintly, the sound of lamentation leaked from within the human face.

The terrifying human visage formed by the banner now displayed a look of satisfaction; the numerous eyes on its face glittered with excited light.

"Hic..." It even let out an unmistakable belch of fullness.

The moment the huge black shadow was devoured, the remaining stragglers fled into surrounding crevices and did not dare show themselves again—they seemed to have realized the Ten Thousand Souls Banner was their nemesis and utterly unstoppable.

Seeing this, the Void King Realm expert wrapped in black qi, still somewhat pleased, waved his hand and the Ten Thousand Souls Banner reappeared, flying back into his palm.

On the surface it did not look much different than before, but the malignance it radiated had clearly increased a notch.

"Heh heh heh..." The Void King Realm expert emitted a chilling chuckle, fondling his Secret Treasure. He nodded repeatedly, "Not bad, not bad—just arrived and already such a haul. Truly a Lost Realm that lives up to its name; I look forward to more."

He acted as if maddened, speaking crazy talk for a time, then laughing as he sheathed the Ten Thousand Souls Banner. Enveloped in black qi, he shot out of the subterranean chasm and gave chase in the precise direction Yang Kai and the others had fled.

Somewhere else in the Lost Realm, Sword Alliance elder Cui Hong was desperately activating his Secret Treasure, fighting in a desperate struggle with a demonic beast more than ten zhang long that resembled a winged snake.

His luck had not been good—shortly after entering the Lost Realm he had stumbled into this beast's territory; once discovered, a fight was inevitable.

The most dangerous thing in the Lost Realm was the invisible spatial rifts; these rifts were scattered without pattern, invisible to the naked eye and imperceptible to Divine Sense. Even a Void King Realm cultivator would barely escape with skin intact upon encountering one.

The second most dangerous threat was the demonic beasts that lived here.

The beasts here had inherited the bloodlines of ancient aberrant species; influenced by the world's laws here, each was incomparably strong—even beasts of the same rank were roughly a third stronger than those found within the Star Domain.

The one Cui Hong encountered was a genuine Tenth-Tier demonic beast; from its appearance it clearly bore the bloodline of a feathered wing-dragon, though with the passage of years and the changes in heaven-and-earth laws and tidal forces, it had lost the majestic air of its ancestors—otherwise a mere glance would have turned Cui Hong into a corpse.

Still... it was after all a Tenth-Tier demonic beast, and in the Star Domain a Tenth-Tier demonic beast was equivalent to a Void King Realm expert—an exceedingly rare existence.

Fortunately, this beast seemed recently evolved, and as an elder of the Sword Alliance, Cui Hong's battle armor and Secret Treasures were of high quality. Across the fight with the winged-serpent he did not fall behind; by employing various secret arts he gradually gained the upper hand.

The winged-serpent measured more than ten zhang, with a back structure like bat wings; long fangs slid in and out of its mouth, its body infinitely agile as it danced around Cui Hong, periodically striking with whip-like fangs that battered him and sent him staggering.

After battling for two or three hours, Cui Hong, bleeding and injured, risked everything in a single strike to slay the winged-serpent.

He stood panting, his body stained with blood, cursing under his breath. After resting for a while, he finally had the strength to place the winged-serpent's corpse into his Spatial Ring.

He had no time to deal with the carcass properly now and would have to sort it out after leaving the Lost Realm. The value of a Tenth-Tier demonic beast's body was almost unimaginable, especially its Inner Core, which was a huge temptation for any Void King Realm cultivator.

Once a martial artist reached the Void King Realm, advancement became unbearably difficult; this was already the limit for Star Domain cultivators. To progress further, besides long periods of meditation and comprehension of the Martial Dao, they had to gather exceedingly rare spiritual pills and miraculous medicines commensurate with their cultivation.

A Void King Realm cultivator might spend a hundred years or a thousand years unable to break through—this was commonplace.

For this reason, top experts at the Third Stage of the Void King Realm were as rare as phoenix feathers; each was a prodigy of a bygone age, for there was nothing left in the world to truly entice them...

After resting a while on the spot, Cui Hong immediately left that bloody place; he feared the scent of blood would attract other demonic beasts, and in his current condition he could not withstand another fight like the one he had just endured.

Elsewhere, the Sword Alliance lord Zi Long moved briskly through the Lost Realm with Zi Donglai at his side; he seemed to have a clear objective and did not pause along the way.

They had also been quite fortunate—since entering they had encountered no danger, allowing them to travel with relative peace of mind.

"Father, is there truly an Everlasting Tree in this Lost Realm?" Zi Donglai, walking behind Zi Long, suddenly asked.

At the mention of the words "Everlasting Tree," Zi Long's calm eyes flared with dazzling light; his purple hair rose as if stirred by a windless breeze. He kept walking and nodded slightly, "Father cannot be absolutely certain, but I'm eighty percent confident. After all, the information came from your great-uncle—he once came here two thousand years ago and saw a tree very similar to the legendary Everlasting Tree, but he failed to obtain it. He was grievously wounded by the demonic beast that guarded that tree and had to withdraw, ultimately dying in despair."

Zi Donglai's face shifted; he murmured, "I recall great-uncle was at the Second Stage of the Void King Realm—he was severely wounded by the guardian demonic beast? What kind of beast is it?"

"A divine bird... an Ancient Peacock!" Zi Long inhaled deeply.

Zi Donglai's complexion likewise changed in alarm at the words "divine bird."

Any demonic beast associated with the words "ancient" was never to be trifled with; they possessed world-destroying methods and savage dispositions. If such a beast were to break into the Star Domain it might devastate countless Cultivation Stars and become a calamity across the Star Domain.

Zi Long's voice deepened: "In the Star Domain the Three Divine Waters are widely known: Life Jade Nectar, Soul Cleansing Divine Water, and Immortal Source Liquid. Of these, Soul Cleansing Divine Water occasionally appears but remains rare, perhaps surfacing once in centuries or millennia. Life Jade Nectar and Immortal Source Liquid are considered lost to history; in my many years I have never heard of anyone obtaining them. The Three Divine Waters each possess unique effects—Soul Cleansing Divine Water refines the divine soul, making it more condensed and mighty, an unparalleled treasure to temper Divine Sense power; Life Jade Nectar strengthens the body and Qi and blood—one drop can transform a life, scrubbing the vessels and marrow to make the flesh extraordinarily powerful. Yet... compared to Immortal Source Liquid, these two pale considerably."

"Father, what does the Immortal Source Liquid have to do with the Everlasting Tree?" Zi Donglai asked, curious.

"Heh heh, of course they are related." As a regional hegemon, Zi Long naturally exuded authority, yet before his son he was gentle—after all, Zi Donglai had never disappointed him and was the son he favored as heir.

"Please, instruct me, Father!" Zi Donglai said solemnly, adopting an attitude eager to learn.
