## Chapter 1356 — Division

The Spatial Ring isn't able to hold absolutely everything; items that are too large in volume or too heavy sometimes cannot be placed inside a Spatial Ring, and some extraordinary treasures are the same — for example, the Sun's True Essence that Yang Kai and Yang Yan found in the Corpse Den last time.

It could not be placed into the Spatial Ring because the scorching heat it radiated far exceeded the limit the ring could endure; if it were put in, it would inevitably destroy the Spatial Ring.

That was why Yang Yan expended so much effort to specially forge a ring.

Strictly speaking, the puppet before them wasn't actually very large, yet it still couldn't be placed into the Spatial Ring; the only explanation was that its weight far exceeded what Yang Kai had imagined.

At that thought, a trace of surprise and strangeness flickered across Yang Kai's eyes.

While he pondered, Cai He and Du Sisi also walked over from nearby. The fierce battle was over; it was time to scavenge the spoils. Everyone could see the puppet's extraordinariness, and the two Formation Masters naturally didn't want Yang Kai to monopolize the benefits. They finished their recuperation in haste and joined Yang Kai.

"Brother Yang, this puppet is probably a relic from the ancient times, its value is extraordinary," Cai He chuckled, his words carrying another meaning.

"Indeed, if we can unravel its driving method, it would be a great boon," Du Sisi's beautiful eyes glittered with excitement.

Yang Kai stroked his chin, looked at them, and didn't call out their motives; he smiled calmly and said, "Both of you have an interest in it?"

Cai He let out an awkward laugh, while Du Sisi spoke bluntly, “Of course. Who would be willing to miss out on something this valuable? Even if we can’t figure out how to unravel it, we might still glean insights into the puppet refinement techniques of ancient times through studying it. I can’t speak for others, but I’m certain Lian Guang would be very interested in it.”

She wasn't wrong. Such a puppet, regardless of its intrinsic value, possessed incalculable research worth. If the Lian Clan, famed for puppet-forging, heard of it, they would certainly not let it slip by.

"Hm." Yang Kai nodded lightly. Although Du Sisi had a bit of a young lady's temper, after the three of them had worked together his impression of her improved somewhat. After a moment of thought he said, "The three of us put forth great effort in this battle, but there's only one puppet — how should it be divided?"

Cai He and Du Sisi exchanged a look, neither able to come up with a good suggestion.

Seeing their troubled faces, Yang Kai chuckled and said, "Let's do it this way. I don't want the puppet; I only want that pitch-black giant staff. You two can decide who gets the puppet, and of course, the Spatial Ring left behind by that elder."

After the old crone was crushed, her Spatial Ring had fallen at the puppet's feet. Yang Kai had never had the chance to obtain it, so now, with the puppet and the giant staff, that made three items to divide among the three of them.

No one knew what was inside her Spatial Ring, but that vial of Life Jade Nectar was certainly not a fake.

"Only that staff?" Du Sisi glanced at the pitch-black giant staff beside the puppet. A reluctant look flashed across her pretty eyes — honestly, she also recognized the staff's value surely wasn't below the puppet's. She hesitated at giving it to Yang Kai, but when she thought of the old woman's Spatial Ring she felt a stir of temptation.

Cai He immediately chimed in, "Fine. Brother Yang was also one of the main forces in this fight, nearly died several times and yet survived; I have no objections to this distribution."

With him saying that, what else could Du Sisi do?

Yang Kai thanked them for yielding, then walked to the pitch-black giant staff. After thinking for a moment he reached out and laid his hand on it; his Divine Sense was released and he began to probe it carefully.

After a short while Yang Kai's expression changed; Saint Yuan surged forth and he poured it into the pitch-black giant staff.

An incredible sight occurred — as Saint Yuan was injected, the staff, dozens of zhang long and as thick as a water bucket, shrank at an astonishing speed; in the blink of an eye it had become about a man's height.

Cai He and Du Sisi, who were discussing the puppet and the Spatial Ring's division nearby, were left staring in astonishment.

Yang Kai showed a look of "sure enough"; when he first saw the puppet he hadn't noticed the staff, but it had suddenly been produced after the puppet crushed the old crone. He had suspected then that the staff might be able to change size at will — now his test proved his guess correct.

Reaching for the pitch-black staff, Yang Kai's face tightened, and then a look of delight appeared.

He found that it was somewhat difficult to lift — choosing to take it had indeed been the right decision. This staff must have been forged from some extraordinary material.

The puppet had already been destroyed; attempting to repair it by means used on Dark Star would likely be impossible. It would be useless to keep it, at best exchanging it with the Lian Clan for some Saint Crystals and treasures. As for the Life Jade Nectar inside the old woman's Spatial Ring… if it were merely a diluted product, it was not worth having. Yang Kai was quite confident that somewhere inside the rockery there existed a purer vial of Life Jade Nectar.

Though delighted inwardly, Yang Kai kept his expression composed; he poured line after line of Saint Yuan into the staff, then unleashed a vast Divine Sense to wrap the staff and store it into the ring Yang Yan had forged.

That ring could store Sun's True Essence and the Ten-Thousand-Year Ice Jade; holding a single extraordinarily heavy staff was naturally trivial.

With Yang Kai finished, Cai He and Du Sisi had also decided matters. Cai He walked to where the puppet had stood and picked up the old woman's Spatial Ring, while Du Sisi produced a bracelet-like Secret Treasure. Her face lit with joy as she tossed the bracelet, which immediately enlarged into a circular ring that hovered above the puppet. From the ring, willow-like strands of energy flowed out.

Those energy filaments attached to the puppet and quickly wrapped it up into a dumpling-like bundle. Du Sisi uttered a low cry, "Seal!"

The innumerable strands instantly retracted and the huge puppet was gradually drawn into the ring; in less than ten breaths it vanished. The ring resumed its bracelet form and flew back to slip onto Du Sisi's fair wrist.

Everyone was elated; the three each gained something.

Yang Kai had no intention of being a glutton for gain. Cai He and Du Sisi had helped significantly to disable the puppet; he of course wouldn't betray them afterwards.

Which of the three gains was weightier — only heaven knew. In any case, after Cai He inspected the old woman's Spatial Ring his brow brimmed with joy; he was clearly satisfied with his haul.

"Brother Yang, what shall we do next?" Perhaps owing to the prior battle, Cai He showed some tendency to defer to Yang Kai.

At the question, Du Sisi also turned to look this way.

Yang Kai pondered a moment and then smiled: "Waiting here is no solution; there's only one exit, we have no choice. But where that exit leads and what dangers lie ahead we cannot yet know. Given how tightly the puppet guarded it, there might be something valuable inside…"

Cai He and Du Sisi brightened at this.

Yang Kai's tone shifted as he added gravely, "But where there's treasure, there's danger. You two must be mentally prepared."

"Naturally. Brother Yang means we continue onward to explore?"

"Yes. In any case, we must find a way out of this ancient ruin."

The two Formation Masters had no objections to that. After resting briefly the three followed Yang Kai's lead toward the circular gate.

Passing through the circular gate, Yang Kai suddenly discovered a straight corridor ahead.

He used Divine Sense to probe and, finding nothing odd, proceeded forward cautiously.

The corridor wasn't long, only about a hundred zhang or so; soon the three passed through it and stepped into another palace chamber.

The moment he entered, Yang Kai's eyes narrowed and he stared at the very center of the chamber with extreme surprise, exclaiming, "Elder Qian?"

Cai He and Du Sisi hurried over at his call. Hearing Yang Kai call out, their expressions brightened and they looked over, but when they took in the situation they couldn't help but smile wryly and feel a headache.

There, Qian Tong sat cross-legged on the ground, a bitter smile on his face as he looked toward them.

Beside him sat a middle-aged man of roughly the Second Stage of the Saint King Realm, pale and looking mentally injured. This man should be the artificer who accompanied Qian Tong into this place, Yang Kai judged.

After all, Fei Zhi Tu had said Qian Tong hadn't come alone; he had brought a Saint-Grade artificer in hopes that through this exploration the artificer could be promoted to Origin-Grade to replace the late Master Gelin of Yingyue Hall.

Beside the two was a stone stele covered in minuscule inscriptions. Even from such a distance Yang Kai could make out that the small characters were ancient script they did not recognize, yet the stele exuded an enigmatic charm, as if sitting before it to contemplate would yield great gains.

Moreover, around the two were gathered more than a dozen puppets, some humanoid, some in demonic beast form, each emanating murderous intent; they stared at Qian Tong and the Saint-Grade artificer like tigers watching prey, yet made no move to attack, only surrounded them.

After a brief probe, Yang Kai couldn’t help but groan inwardly.

Even if those dozen puppets weren't as powerful as the one they'd earlier encountered, they were probably not far off. With such numbers it's no wonder Qian Tong sat unmoving — if he so much as moved, those puppets would shred him to pieces.

"Why have you come?" Qian Tong's voice was weak but intact; he looked at the three who had suddenly arrived and asked in surprise.

"Elder Qian, these puppets…" Yang Kai didn't answer immediately but watched the dozen puppets warily.

"No matter. They guard this place; as long as you don't continue forward you'll be safe. As for this old man… hm, with the stele's deterrent they dare not approach; for now I cannot die."

Hearing that, Yang Kai relaxed. He recounted how Fei Zhi Tu had invited them to come to rescue Qian Tong.
