## Chapter 675 — Someone Comes to Request

Five hundred li from Giant Stone City, in a place of clear mountains and flowing water, this spot lay on the edge of the snow-covered peaks yet enjoyed birdsong and flowers year-round and a pleasant climate; rows of houses sat within a vast valley, and from time to time martial artists of high cultivation entered and departed.

This place was the foundation of a great power.

At this moment, in a secluded chamber, an elderly cultivator who had been sitting in seclusion suddenly opened his tightly closed eyes; his pupils glittered, suspicion creased his face, and he lifted his head to stare in the direction of Giant Stone City.

At that instant he felt a faint, subtle fluctuation of energy transmitted from that direction, a fluctuation that stirred in him a sense of déjà vu.

After a moment's thought, the elder formed several abstruse hand seals and sent out a thread of energy.

Moments later he swept his hand before him; ripples immediately rolled across the void, and within those ripples a vague human silhouette materialized.

The elder stared blankly; his expression grew ever stranger and more suspicious as he silently noted the silhouette's approximate features. Just as he was about to study it more closely, the ripples suddenly stirred more frequently, and the figure turned its head with a cold, cautious look, face full of doubt.

"Strong vigilance!" the elder muttered, astonishment appearing on his face.

He could tell that given the figure's apparent age, its cultivation could not be very high; yet when he had used his great supernatural art to peer hundreds of li away to see the other's face, he had been detected.

The next moment the ripples spread and the figure vanished.

"Interesting," the elder smiled lightly and called aloud, "Cang Yan."

The door answered with a push. A man with a restrained aura walked in and respectfully asked, "What orders does Senior Ancestor have?"

"Go to Giant Stone City. Bring that person to me!" The elder pointed; a surge of energy flowed into Cang Yan's mind, and Cang Yan immediately saw that vague silhouette.

"Yes." Cang Yan nodded solemnly.

"And be polite to him," the elder cautioned again, still uneasy.

Cang Yan's expression was odd, but he asked no more and quickly left the chamber to make preparations and head for Giant Stone City.

The Alchemists' Association.

Mi Na, who was currently seeking Yang Kai's tutelage in alchemy, stared at Yang Kai in a daze and asked, "What's wrong with you?"

Yang Kai frowned, staring at a certain patch of empty air; in that moment he had felt as if someone had been spying on him, and he had shivered for no reason.

But when he investigated carefully, he found nothing at all.

"Nothing." Yang Kai shook his head, puzzled. With his Divine Sense, even if a Transcendent Realm cultivator were spying, he would detect it clearly. Only a Saint Realm expert would elude such scrutiny, and such a level of cultivator would hardly take an interest in him.

Since arriving on the Tongxuan Continent, Yang Kai had no enemies; the only enchantress had already been slain by him.

"Oh." Mi Na did not press further, instead returning to ask Yang Kai about finer points of pill-refining; Yang Kai did not hold back and answered her questions and doubts as fully as he could.

Naturally, when it came to the most secret aspects of the True Alchemy Formula, he still kept silent.

The True Alchemy Formula was very likely something left behind by the Great Demon God. If that information leaked out it would bring him a hundred harms and not one benefit.

Having stayed at the Alchemists' Association for a month and a half, whether Elder Du, Ye Xiong, or Mi Na, they treated him like family, which warmed the heart of the rootless Yang Kai.

However Yang Kai noticed that aside from Mi Na, Elder Du and Ye Xiong sometimes treated him with an excessive familiarity that lacked the proper distance of elder to junior, which made him a little uncomfortable.

Over those days Yang Kai kept refining pills constantly, rapidly consuming the materials he had purchased.

When Li Rong and the others had supplied him with herbs back at Mo Shen Fort, Yang Kai had not thought much of it, but now that he was preparing materials himself, he realized how vast the consumption truly was.

Even though he had a fair number of Crystal Stones, they would probably be exhausted before long.

Yet he had to continue refining pills to raise his rank and refine his skill in the True Alchemy Formula.

"Mi Na, how do you ensure you have enough materials to keep refining?"

"Who’s as perverse as you?" Mi Na rolled her eyes. "You refine at an insane speed. My master takes half a day to produce one spirit pill; he can make at most two a day."

Yang Kai was taken aback.

"But the pills we produce can be sold, exchanged for Crystal Stones, and then we can buy materials to continue refining."

Yang Kai's eyes lit up; he had been so absorbed in refining he had completely forgotten he could sell the pills he produced.

Up to now Yang Kai had never worried about money or considered ways to make a living.

Most of the pills he made were Spirit-Grade; in both quality and tier they met the needs of most martial artists, so finding buyers would be no problem.

Under Mi Na's guidance, Yang Kai and she went to the shop run by the Alchemists' Association; the old shopkeeper who had instructed Yang Kai gave him a very favorable price, so the Crystal Stones he had spent were not only all recovered but he even turned a handsome profit.

After buying sufficient materials, Yang Kai returned once more to the Alchemists' Association.

Time passed and a month slipped by.

Once he confirmed that the people in the Alchemists' Association truly harbored no ill will toward him, Yang Kai decided to speak with Elder Du.

He did not intend to spend his life at the Association refining pills. Living there had another purpose: to use the prestige of being an alchemist to accomplish his goal of finding Su Yan and Little Junior Sister.

"You seek someone?" Elder Du looked shocked when he heard Yang Kai.

"Yes, my two Senior Sisters and a Senior Uncle." Yang Kai nodded. He dared not reveal Di Mo; Meng Wuya was Xia Ningshang's master, so he counted as a Senior Uncle.

Elder Du's expression flickered; he thought this was no small matter. This enormous figure behind Yang Kai suddenly had three successors, and clearly the other two women were formidable; a senior elder accompanying them might even be stronger than Yang Kai.

"If you want to find them, the Association can offer a little help. I can transmit information and ask the other branches to keep an eye out; if there is news they will inform you at once. But the Association has many trivial affairs, and I can only offer what little I can. If you truly wish to find them, you must still find ways yourself."

"Thank you, Elder, that is already a great help." Yang Kai said earnestly.

Elder Du hesitated, thinking for a long moment before saying, "If this is your heart's desire, I suggest you rely on the nearby powers and have them assist your search. With your identity as a Lower-Level Spirit-Grade alchemist, I do not think any of the powers would refuse you; wherever you go they will treat you as an honored guest."

"I had that idea, but I am not familiar with the nearby powers and do not know which to choose. Please, Elder, point me in the right direction."

He genuinely did not know the nearby major powers; if he attached himself to one with ill intent, it would be hard to extricate himself. Only driven by necessity had Yang Kai entertained such a plan.

"I see." Elder Du nodded slightly. "The nearby powers — the Leiguang Divine Cult, Tianxiao Sect, Ancient Moon Sanctuary, and Rashomon Gate — are the top tier. If you must choose, pick from these four, but avoid Rashomon Gate; those people are hard to deal with. As for the remaining three… well, I have some connections with them, so if you truly must pick one, it's a bit troublesome."

"All three are options?" Yang Kai brightened.

"All three have reasonably good reputations. Let me consider carefully and give you an answer in a few days, all right?"

"Thank you, Elder Du."

"You are welcome."

In the days that followed nothing disturbed the peace; Yang Kai continued refining pills daily, and Mi Na frequently came to consult him.

One day Elder Du suddenly summoned him; Yang Kai set aside his work and went to Elder Du's room.

He had expected Elder Du to have reached a decision and to recommend which power he should approach, but when he pushed open the door Yang Kai found a stranger in the room.

The man's aura was restrained, his eyes sharp with brilliance. The moment Yang Kai entered, the man stared fixedly at him, seeming very interested.

A Transcendent Realm cultivator! Yang Kai's heart tightened; to exert pressure on him, this man was at least Transcendent Second Stage.

"Elder Du." Yang Kai greeted.

"Please sit, young friend." Elder Du chuckled.

"Is this the new alchemist who came to the Association?" the man asked with amusement as he sized Yang Kai up, his expression warm.

"Indeed, he is a remarkably gifted Spirit-Grade alchemist." Elder Du replied seriously.

"Spirit-Grade?" The man's face changed; he looked at Yang Kai with some disbelief.

"I would not lie."

"I trust Elder Du," the man nodded solemnly.

"Young friend, let me introduce you. This is Elder Duan Hai of the Leiguang Divine Cult."

Yang Kai inclined his head slightly in greeting.

"I have some acquaintance with Elder Duan Hai. I don't know where Elder Duan heard the news, but upon learning you had taken up lodgings with the Association he hurried here to invite you to serve as a guest official of the Leiguang Divine Cult."

Duan Hai smiled and said, "It's not that I was constantly watching your Association — it was that my junior brother happened to come to Giant Stone City on business and saw Mi Na enter with this friend; my junior brother knew I had some ties with Elder Du, so he urged me to come make this bold request; otherwise I feared others would beat me to it."

Elder Du chuckled wryly.

Since entering the Association Yang Kai had only gone out once, yet had still been noticed by someone paying attention; it could only be called coincidence.

"Might this friend have any intention of joining my Divine Cult?" Duan Hai asked, looking at Yang Kai with expectation. A Spirit-Grade alchemist was already a fine catch, and what made this one precious was his youth and obvious exceptional aptitude. If they could make him dependent on and loyal to the Cult, in time they could cultivate him to Saint-Grade. The Leiguang Divine Cult had never produced such an alchemist at that rank.

It would be a long-term investment.

Duan Hai had both the discernment and the boldness!
