## Chapter 67 — You Are Not As Good As Him

At this very moment, Wei Zhuang was both shocked and heartbroken.

He was shocked that his Xiuyun Chainmail had failed to defend against a single strike, and heartbroken that this treasured defensive artifact had been slashed open, utterly losing its protective power.

Consumed by extreme fury, Wei Zhuang suddenly lunged at Yang Kai, shouting, “How dare you damage my treasure! I will have your life!”

Wei Zhuang himself had reached the third stage of the Open Origin Realm. His full power was no weak force. Yet, Yang Kai had already slain an opponent at the fifth stage of Open Origin Realm during his Body Tempering days. What waves could this mere third-stage cultivator possibly stir?

When Wei Zhuang charged forward, his blood-red blades crossed and slashed fiercely.

Suddenly, Wei Zhuang’s body froze. His fist was only three inches from Yang Kai, yet he could not bring it down. A scorching heat radiated from his chest.

Trembling, he lowered his eyes and saw the blood-red blades in Yang Kai’s hand, writhing like a spiritual serpent, coiling and uncoiling, pressing against his heart.

“A defensive treasure, and yet it’s nothing special,” Yang Kai sneered coldly. His gaze swept over Wei Zhuang’s close-fitting Xiuyun Chainmail, which was now torn with several large gashes.

Even Yang Kai was somewhat surprised. He had not expected the blades formed from his Yang Liquid to be so sharp.

Truth be told, if he were to fight Wei Zhuang properly, victory would not come so easily. Right now, he was relying solely on the power of the Yang Liquid.

But if Wei Zhuang could rely on the Xiuyun Chainmail, why couldn’t he wield the Yang Liquid?

“Dare to harm me, just try!” Wei Zhuang’s face twitched, his expression fierce as he glared at Yang Kai. Though his life was in Yang Kai’s hands, he showed no fear. He was the Grand Elder’s own grandson! His status was exalted, and no one in Lingxiao Pavilion dared to harm him.

“You probably don’t know, but my grandfather is the Grand Elder. Dare to harm me and you’re as good as dead!” Wei Zhuang threatened with grim seriousness.

Yang Kai remained unmoved. The blood-red blades on his fingers writhed even more dangerously, the red light in his eyes growing fiercer.

“Not sure who will die first—me or you,” Yang Kai said with morbid amusement, studying Wei Zhuang with a strange smile as he slowly applied more pressure.

A trickle of crimson blood seeped from Wei Zhuang’s chest. His face paled, and he stifled a groan. The moment his body was wounded, he felt a surge of burning Yuan Qi flood in, scorching his flesh with pain.

“How dare you…” Wei Zhuang stared at Yang Kai in disbelief. He could not fathom that someone in Lingxiao Pavilion would truly dare to harm him.

“Whether I dare or not has already been decided. Do you think I’m bluffing?” Yang Kai pressed on, driving the blade half an inch deeper. Blood flowed freely. Wei Zhuang’s body trembled violently, his voice fierce but inwardly trembling, “Aren’t you afraid my grandfather will kill you?”

“Internal sparring among sect disciples is a matter of life and death at their own risk,” Yang Kai snorted coldly. “You lack skill and deserve to be slain. What of the Grand Elder? Lingxiao Pavilion does not belong to him.”

Fear gripped Wei Zhuang. He stared at this mad, almost deranged fellow disciple before him, a chill rising from his heart, his whole body turning icy cold.

Just as he was about to speak, Yang Kai abruptly interrupted, “Before you utter the words ‘I admit defeat,’ I will kill you. You’d best not entertain that thought.”

Wei Zhuang’s face turned deathly pale. He had indeed intended to admit defeat just now. Among fellow disciples, once one side acknowledges weakness, the other must cease pursuit.

But now, he dared not say those words. There was no hint of jest in Yang Kai’s eyes—only deadly seriousness.

“What exactly do you want?” Wei Zhuang gritted his teeth.

“Nothing. I just think you’re not as good as Su Mu. If you can beat him, it’s only because of your treasure,” Yang Kai said slowly, shaking his head.

“Not as good as him?” Wei Zhuang snarled like a cornered cat, “How am I not as good? My strength surpasses his, my background is better—how am I inferior?”

Yang Kai tilted his head, scrutinizing him. “Don’t believe me? I’ll show you.”

With that, he suddenly pressed harder with his fingers. Wei Zhuang couldn’t help but let out a low roar as his face instantly turned ashen and his body staggered.

Yang Kai slowly turned his gaze to the group of Wei Zhuang’s subordinates. They had been fighting fiercely against Li Yuntian and the others just moments ago, but now that Wei Zhuang was subdued, none dared move. They stood frozen, staring blankly.

“Want to save your young master Wei Zhuang?” Yang Kai called out loudly.

No one dared answer. All were cowed by Yang Kai’s ferocity. These were mere teenagers, never having witnessed such ruthless violence.

“If you want to save him, then kneel down and admit your mistakes! If I’m in a good mood, I might spare his life,” Yang Kai said coldly.

The group turned pale. Hadn’t Wei Zhuang said the same to Su Mu’s followers just now?

Su Mu’s men had knelt without hesitation, kowtowing to Wei Zhuang. Would these men follow the same path?

So many eyes were watching. If they knelt now, their pride would be utterly shattered. How could they face anyone in Lingxiao Pavilion afterward? But if they refused, what if Wei Zhuang blamed them?

Their expressions were conflicted, minds racing, unable to decide.

“You’re just wishing him dead,” Yang Kai sighed lightly, pressing the blade deeper into Wei Zhuang’s body.

Wei Zhuang was terrified beyond measure. He could clearly feel that if the blade sank any further, it would pierce his heart—a fatal strike.

He did not want to die. Sweat poured down his body as he shouted hoarsely at his subordinates, “What are you waiting for? Kneel at once! If I die, not one of you will live!”

Only then did his followers tremble and hurriedly kneel.

Li Yuntian and the others watched with surging emotions. The humiliation they had suffered seemed to vanish with this single kneel, leaving them immensely gratified.

Yang Kai turned to Wei Zhuang and said coldly, “Now do you understand the difference between you and Su Mu?”

Wei Zhuang was stunned, then his eyes flickered with resentment as he glared at his subordinates.

Li Yuntian and the others had been willing to suffer humiliation to save Su Mu’s life. But his own men? Only when threatened with death by his own voice did they reluctantly comply with Yang Kai’s demand.

The contrast between Wei Zhuang and Su Mu was clear for all to see. In terms of personal charisma, Wei Zhuang was indeed inferior.

“Are you satisfied now?” Wei Zhuang forced himself to stand firm, looking coldly at Yang Kai.

Yang Kai narrowed his eyes, his expression flickering.

Wei Zhuang’s face turned pale with shock. “You wouldn’t…”

Before Yang Kai could answer, a furious shout rang out from afar: “Everyone, stop at once!”
