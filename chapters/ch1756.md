## Chapter 1756 — A Lifetime's Record

Aside from that, other faces Yang Kai had never seen kept flashing through his mind — men and women, old and young. Although he had never met them, he felt an uncanny familiarity with them, to the point that he could even call out their names.

Di Mo, Ling Taixu, Chu Lingxiao, Fei Yu, Li Wan, Fei Jian, Cang Yan, Li Rong, Han Fei, Xue Yue, Wu Yi, Ye Xijun, Daiyuan, Qian Tong...

Those faces crowded Yang Kai's mind; each of them mouthed words, constantly trying to tell him something, but no matter what, Yang Kai could not hear them.

Years passed uneventfully. Yang Kai entered his thirties, then his forties, then his fifties, and finally reached sixty...

In his seventies he already had a house full of children and grandchildren; his parents had long since passed away and many affairs had changed greatly. The only thing that had not changed was the procession of faces that had flashed through his mind for years on end.

Those faces grew clearer and clearer, and faint voices had begun to barely reach his senses.

A sudden serious illness struck and shattered Yang Kai's vitality.

Lying on his sickbed, muffled cries came from outside the room — the voices of his many children and grandchildren. Yang Kai knew his days were numbered.

The wife who had accompanied him all his life had long since lost her former youthful beauty; now she was only an ordinary old woman. Yet in these final moments she still stayed faithfully by his bedside, tending to Yang Kai's needs.

A life like this... wasn't it not bad? Yang Kai thought weakly, casting a cloudy gaze at his wife at the bedside; decades of toil had left her with temples white with hair.

Yang Kai forced a faint smile for her.

But to Yang Kai's surprise, the wife who had always obeyed him now wore a face of chilling indifference, staring at him with cold eyes.

"You..." Yang Kai opened his mouth and uttered a single word.

The other's voice that came was crisp and pleasant, wholly unlike that of an old woman; it sounded instead like that of a young woman: "Finally free. I was burdened by you my whole life; only now am I truly free!"

"You... why do you say that?" Yang Kai asked, looking at her in puzzlement, his eyes full of pain and disappointment.

“Then what do you expect me to say?” the other sneered. “Should I thank you? If not for the power of your Yang Family, how would I have been married into it decades ago? You, Yang Kai, are nothing but a worthless man. Were it not for your family name, you wouldn’t even compare to an ordinary person. And even so, you’ve still wasted your entire life!”

"Is that what you truly think?"

"Yes! Disappointed?" she continued to sneer. The smile was cruel, like a sharp blade, as if wanting to pierce Yang Kai's heart.

Yang Kai let out a short, bitter laugh and closed his eyes.

The old woman at the bedside smiled even more coldly.

Yang Kai suddenly spoke. “No dreams, no illusions. To be honest, you’ve done quite well over these past decades… but I know—this is nothing more than an illusion.”

"What?" The old woman's face changed; she rose abruptly, looking at Yang Kai in disbelief. "Do you know what you're saying?"

“At this point, shouldn’t you be tearing off the mask and striking hard at my satisfaction with this life—driving me into despair?” Yang Kai opened his eyes once more; the murkiness within them had vanished, replaced by a gaze shining with divine light. With a mocking smile, he said, “Even those people outside, the ones preparing to wail at my funeral—shouldn’t they be rushing in to scold me, listing all my failings over the years so that I can’t die in peace? Isn’t that how it should be?”

"How could you..." The old woman's face turned ashen.

“How couldn’t I notice it? I sensed it more than thirty years ago—none of this is real! I remember everything that I was meant to remember!”

"If you noticed it, why did you play along?" The old woman's face had already contorted.

“Heh…” Yang Kai chuckled, sitting upright on the bed. After a moment of contemplation, he said, “Because this is a life I’ve never lived before. Since I’ve been given the chance, of course I wanted to experience it for myself. It can also temper my state of mind, can it not?”

Those faces, at once familiar and strange, that had flashed through Yang Kai's mind, and the words that had constantly tried to whisper in his ear, finally made him recall everything from those decades ago within this illusion.

Yang Kai had been startled!

He had no idea when he had been ensnared, nor did he detect any enemies. He remembered that he had been acting as an escort with Xue Yue for Luo Lan and Ni Guang, and there had been no sign of any foes around.

The situation was far too strange.

This meant that the unknown enemy's spirit power was so formidable as to be unimaginable; it could invade one's Sea of Consciousness without anyone knowing, tamper with memories, influence thought, make one forget what should be remembered and instead believe in this fabricated life.

So he did not rush to act.

Firstly, he did not know who the enemy was; rash action might be imprudent. Secondly, as he had said, this life was one he had not experienced and it was indeed not a bad one. Of course... if this "wife" who had accompanied him could remain steady until the end and see him off, that would be ideal.

Yet at the final moment, she tried to destroy this rare, precious experience for Yang Kai and make him feel despair.

A person would only ever possess a single life.

A second life was only a wish; the matter of reincarnation was too nebulous to trust. Even if reincarnation truly existed, who could be reborn carrying the memories of their previous life and start anew?

Yang Kai had, in effect, experienced one — albeit a mere seventy years...

As his words fell, the group of grandchildren who had been crying outside fell silent in an instant, and then a wave of wailing and howling rose up, chilling to the bone.

The old woman sneered: "You think seeing through the illusion means you can sleep easy? You overestimate yourself. If you had exposed it earlier you might have escaped, but in your thought time has passed so long that now you can never leave. Your spirit will sink here forever!"

"Is that so?" Yang Kai's expression did not change; he chuckled, "It seems you possess no direct means of attack, only the ability to manipulate others' memories to influence them?"

That remark had evidently exposed the old woman's ability, and her face changed.

After all, if she had direct offensive power, given the circumstances she would not have waited to be passive — she would have attacked. Instead, her bluster and shrill cries betrayed a lack of resolve.

"Enough, let it end here. Still... I must thank you. The experiences of this life have steadied my state of mind; I feel more confident in breaking into the Void King Realm," Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

His problem was that his strength had risen too quickly: in under forty years of cultivation he had already reached the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm. Such power required matching temperamental cultivation to control it; otherwise he risked falling into Qi Deviation during cultivation.

This was his weakness.

But this experience had filled that gap: no matter how long had passed outside, his mind had spent at least seventy years here, and the temperamental cultivation accumulated was sufficient to match the needs of his realm.

He truly had to thank the other for granting him such an opportunity.

By itself, that was enough to make the journey worthwhile; even if he gained nothing in the trials to come, it would not matter.

Yang Kai planned that after leaving the Lost Realm he would find a place to ascend to the Void King Realm, and he had already chosen that place in his mind.

He already had great confidence in breaking into the Void King Realm; coupled with this experience, it would surely come to fruition.

When Yang Kai's words fell, the uneasy old woman opposite had no retort. Suddenly her form changed drastically into a mass of black mist; from that mist issued a chilling roar, and it lunged at Yang Kai.

At the same time, outside the room many other black mists followed, claws and fangs brandishing as they rushed toward Yang Kai.

Yang Kai snorted coldly; as his eyelids flicked, the World-Ending Demon Eye had already exerted its power.

The World-Ending Demon Eye possessed the divine effect of piercing illusion; it was the greatest nemesis of this kind of phantasm.

Once the Demon Eye appeared, the entire world began to collapse like a shattered mirror — the room, the entire Yang residence, even the Zhongdu world, all began to crack.

Yet those hunks of black shadow that lunged at Yang Kai did not harm him in the slightest. As he had suspected earlier, these shadows had no means of direct assault; all they did was stir up negative emotions in those trapped by the illusion.

The black shadows passed through Yang Kai's body and then vanished.

In an instant, the illusion was broken.

Yang Kai returned to the real world.

Before he could react, a chill gust struck from behind; he rolled forward in a hurry to avoid the attack from his rear. Once he steadied himself, he turned to look back.

He saw the same kind of black shadow as in the illusion, but this one took a humanoid form — no facial features, only limbs and a shape.

It seemed that this black shadow had been responsible for the earlier illusion; Yang Kai understood immediately.

At the same time, the shadow itself appeared to be heavily wounded; after all, it had used secret arts to drag Yang Kai into the illusion, and the breaking of that art had harmed it.

With a roar, the shadow lunged at Yang Kai again.

Yang Kai flicked his hand and shot out a strand of Golden Blood Threads, slicing toward it. Unexpectedly, the usually unstoppable Golden Blood Threads had no effect on the shadow; they passed through its body without causing any harm.

Yang Kai frowned; Saint Yuan surged, and with a Heaven-Covering Palm he struck down.

The massive palm covered the shadow's form, yet likewise had no effect.

After a brief hesitation, the shadow had already leapt before him.

"Golden Blood Threads useless, Saint Yuan arts useless — it seems... only spirit attacks work on you," Yang Kai sneered repeatedly, standing his ground without moving. At his left eye a lotus pattern suddenly bloomed, still in bud.
