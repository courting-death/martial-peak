## Chapter 481 — Fengshen Hall

“Young Master!” Ying Jiu’s concerned voice came from behind.

“It’s nothing!” Yang Kai slowly shook his head, a deep sense of helplessness surfacing on his face.

From Yang Wei and Meng Shanyi’s perspective, he had just been magnificent, single-handedly fending off a fierce assault from over a dozen Divine Roaming Realm masters with only himself and a treasure. Yet the hardship of that moment was something only Yang Kai truly understood.

Even a Mystery-Grade treasure, no matter how excellent, could not empower a True Essence Realm martial artist to exert such overwhelming strength.

Treasures and Martial Skills are essentially similar — merely embellishments atop a foundation. A martial artist’s true strength depends on their own innate power.

The Bone Shield was indeed extraordinary. With it, even Dong Qinghan and the others would not fear facing Divine Roaming Realm experts below the Fifth Stage.

But the use of that treasure consumed a tremendous amount of True Essence.

In that instant just now, Yang Kai had injected a dozen drops of True Essence stored within his Yang Liquid into the Bone Shield, allowing it to devour the attacks of those masters.

Any other martial artist of the same level using it, even if they spent all their True Essence, could not hope to block a single blow from an Eighth Stage Divine Roaming Realm expert.

The Bone Shield’s defensive power and absorption limit depend entirely on how much True Essence is poured into it.

The more True Essence invested, the more attacks it can absorb, and the stronger its defense becomes.

Such a huge consumption pained Yang Kai somewhat, but at least he had convinced Yang Wei, so there was some gain.

His own strength was still somewhat lacking. Once he reached the Divine Roaming Realm, the cost for such a situation would be far less.

Yang Kai burned with an impatient desire to advance his strength. His gaze gradually hardened, and a fiery impulse to immediately retreat and cultivate surged within him.

Ying Jiu, always like a shadow and constantly attentive, was not blind to this subtle change. The Blood Servant’s expression turned strange as if sensing Yang Kai’s inner thoughts.

It seemed this young master was the type who found courage in hardships.

Most martial artists, after witnessing the formidable techniques of powerful experts, would carry a shadow in their hearts. Such shadows could become mental shackles or obstacles even in their cultivation, never fully disappearing in their lifetime.

But this young master’s character was resolute, his pursuit of Martial Arts rock solid. Not only unaffected, but further ignited with overwhelming fighting spirit. Such temperament, if matched with opportunity and talent, would surely bring great achievements in the future.

Thinking this, Ying Jiu casually asked, “Shall we head back now?”

He guessed that Qiu Yimeng might not rest well tonight. She had tried her best to prevent Yang Kai from acting alone during the day but had failed. Now, she must be worrying about him.

It would be better to return soon and ease Miss Qiu’s mind.

Qiu Yimeng had been busy and overwhelmed lately, working tirelessly. Ying Jiu had never mentioned this before to Yang Kai, but he noticed it all and naturally did not want a noble lady from a great family to endure such lonely nights.

“Still need to go somewhere else,” Yang Kai’s face showed a trace of helplessness as he stepped forward.

Ying Jiu nodded slightly, silent, following closely behind.

They walked through War City for a long time, finally arriving before a huge and majestic palace. Its massive doors stood tightly closed, unattended.

It appeared to be an abandoned palace.

However, when Ying Jiu looked up, he was immediately moved.

This enormous palace was none other than the holiest place at the heart of War City — Fengshen Hall!

The palace where the Eight Great Families of Zhongdu's masters, each beyond the Divine Roaming Realm, made their presence felt!

What was the young master doing here? Ying Jiu wondered.

Looking at the plaque of Fengshen Hall, Yang Kai sighed helplessly. As he had just left Yang Wei’s mansion, an old voice suddenly echoed in his ear, summoning him to Fengshen Hall.

It was the summoning of the Grand Elder of the Yang Family. Yang Kai had no choice but to come!

Apparently, all his movements were still under the surveillance of these eight elders, who could perceive even the slightest of his actions.

This sensation made Yang Kai feel extremely uncomfortable, as if he were being controlled.

His displeasure was evident on his face.

Standing before the hall’s door, Yang Kai had not yet introduced himself when the tightly shut doors slowly opened on their own.

Yang Kai couldn’t help but roll his eyes and led Ying Jiu inside. Only after they entered did the doors gently close behind them. Throughout the process, not a single figure appeared, nor did Yang Kai sense any overflow of energy.

He began to develop a new understanding of the abilities masters beyond the Divine Roaming Realm possessed.

Inside Fengshen Hall, large red carpets were spread on the floor, and sparkling gems adorned the walls, illuminating the grand hall like daylight even in the darkness of night.

Numerous stone pillars stood tall, each intricately carved with vivid patterns of birds and beasts.

But as Yang Kai observed the gems and engravings, a faint sense of perplexity emerged. He vaguely felt these things were not randomly arranged but contained some inexplicable secrets.

Yet upon closer inspection, nothing could be found.

He shook his head and proceeded onward.

That said, the spiritual energy within Fengshen Hall was simple and natural. Though just a palace, being inside felt like being surrounded by the towering mountains. Occasionally, the sounds of birdsong and insects could be heard, accompanied by the trickling of streams and clear mountain springs.

Everywhere exuded a mysterious aura.

Unlike Yang Kai’s curious gaze, Ying Jiu had been visibly tense since entering, his posture stiff, expression serious and meticulous.

There was no guide or someone leading them, but Yang Kai felt as if a voice in the void directed him on where to walk.

A sharp solemnity rose within him.

They wandered through winding paths for a long time until, suddenly, a burst of light appeared abruptly ahead.

Before Yang Kai and Ying Jiu realized it, they found themselves at their destination.

They had arrived at a chamber within Fengshen Hall, where eight elderly men with white hair sat cross-legged around a round platform. Each exuded a transcendent, calm demeanor — the aura of immortals and Daoist sages. 

They occupied eight positions, each separated by a dozen or so zhang, and at the center hovered a large glowing sphere.

Yang Kai and Ying Jiu’s arrival did not disturb the eight elders. The men held mysterious, profound hand seals, sometimes frowning in thought, sometimes smiling gently, channeling energy into the luminous orb.

That energy triggered subtle and unfathomable changes in the sphere.

Unwittingly, Yang Kai and Ying Jiu held their breath and fixed their eyes on the glowing sphere, attempting to grasp the deep meanings hidden in the elders’ movements.

Time hurried past.

After an unknown duration, Yang Kai’s vision blurred. When he recovered, he discovered his position had changed. Originally observing from a distance around the platform, he now stood on a lush meadow beneath blue skies and white clouds, surrounded by the scent of birds and flowers.

A fierce battle roared in the sky above, shaking him so violently he struggled to keep his footing.

Looking up, Yang Kai's breath caught.

The warriors clashing in the sky were the very eight elders beyond Divine Roaming Realm sitting on the platform.

Their moves formed no discernible patterns or traces — spontaneously unleashed, irregular, effortless, yet as elusive as antelope horns, subtly harmonizing with the Dao.

The eight were locked in chaotic combat, all enemies to one another, fighting fiercely. The heavens seemed to collapse and the earth to split, with bursts of immense light surging in midair and fierce winds bending the grass low.

“Ah?” someone exclaimed, stepping out of the battle to peer downwards, suddenly spotting Yang Kai standing there, face confused yet contemplative, utterly astonished.

His presence drew the attention of the others. Upon realizing another figure had entered this little world, they all ceased fighting and revealed strange expressions.

“Brother Yang, this must be your younger successor?” A slightly fat elder asked.

Yang Liting nodded lightly, intrigued, casting a glance at Yang Kai.

“Yang Kai pays respects to the eight venerable elders!” Yang Kai immediately composed himself, bowing respectfully.

“Well done, managing to break into our consciousness. Brother Yang, your esteemed Yang Family has a worthy heir,” another shorter elder laughed heartily.

Despite their detached, aloof nature, these men could not hide their envy and a spark of excitement at Yang Kai’s unexpected arrival.

Yang Liting said nothing further but without any action, Yang Kai’s vision blurred again and suddenly, he was standing directly before him.

“Paying respects to the Grand Elder.”

“Hmm, you are Yang Kai, right?” Yang Liting stood erect, hands behind his back. Though his hair was white, his complexion was youthful, nodding lightly.

“Yes,” Yang Kai replied with neither arrogance nor servility. This Yang Liting was one of the five elders beyond Divine Roaming Realm of the Yang Family. Calculating generations, he was no less than two centuries old.

Separated by many generations and the Yang Family’s own distant filial ties, Yang Kai felt no familial warmth in this moment.

“Do you know why I summoned you?” Yang Liting asked, seemingly testing Yang Kai.

“I have some guesses.” Yang Kai smiled faintly.

Since the succession war began, some time had passed. Yang Liting rarely summoned anyone, and especially did not summon him until now — so Yang Kai naturally suspected the reasons.

No doubt it was because an Earth Demon had appeared in War City. The demonic energy he radiated awakened the vigilance of these eight beyond Divine Roaming Realm elders.

Though the eight refused to intervene in the succession war, they guarded here only to protect the younger generation of martial artists from the Cangyun Evil Land. The sudden appearance of such a powerful Earth Demon made them focus their attention.

“Tell me, where does that man come from?” Yang Liting cut to the chase, his deep eyes seeming to penetrate into Yang Kai’s very soul.
