## Chapter 890 — Swarming Like Flies

Saint-Grade Alchemists were far too rare. Each one served as the head of an Alchemists’ Association in a major city, and with so many people petitioning them to refine pills, countless had to wait years—or even longer—before their turn finally came.

But the Nine Heavens Sacred Land was different. The alchemist’s fame had only just begun to spread, and apparently few had come to request pills yet. Those who arrived found there was no need to wait.

When they said they would bring their friends and relatives to have pills refined, Xu Hui found them agreeable and laughed heartily: “Fine—so long as you bring sufficient compensation, our Sacred Land’s master will naturally take on the work.”

“That goes without saying.” The two of them nodded repeatedly, took their Saint Pills and hurried off, intending to tell the friends and relatives of theirs who couldn’t find a way here.

Time flew, and a month passed.

Outside the Nine Peaks, people thronged, bustling and noisy, a scene of great excitement.

Warriors whose strength had reached the Saint Realm had formed a long line outside the Nine Peaks, anxiously waiting, peering into the peaks with varied expressions.

All of them had come seeking the Sacred Land’s help in pill refinement.

Over the past month, the number of people rushing to the Nine Peaks to request pills only increased. At first it was a scattered few trying their luck—one or two every three to five days—but as more warriors left with Spirit-Grade Pills and Saint Pills in hand, ever more were drawn here.

Gradually, people came every day—sometimes one or two alone, other times small groups arriving together.

Later still, arrivals grew more numerous and more frequent.

It eventually became the scene now before them.

Outside the Nine Peaks, no fewer than dozens of Saint Realm experts waited. Sacred Land elders Luo Sheng and Meng Tianfei stood to one side with some disciples, maintaining order.

As they were guests from afar, the Sacred Land’s disciples provided tea and places to rest for the warriors waiting to enter the Sacred Land to request pill refinement.

But if anyone dared flout the Sacred Land’s rules and try to cut in line, regardless of cultivation, they would be driven out.

This was by Yang Kai’s instructions. The two elders carried out the orders without mercy.

“Why hasn’t it been our turn yet?” someone near the front craned his neck and muttered anxiously.

“Soon. The next batch will be us,” a companion beside him said with expectation.

“Yes, don’t worry—we’ve only been here a few days. In other places you might wait years and still not get in!” a third tried to reassure.

The man brightened considerably and began chatting with those nearby. “I heard that since this Sacred Land’s alchemist began taking in requests, he hasn’t failed once—whether Spirit-Grade or Saint Pill, every attempt succeeds, and those who seek pills leave satisfied.”

“And that’s not all. Many who received Spirit-Grade Pills even ended up with pills showing pill patterns.”

“Really? Are pill patterns for real?”

“I’ve heard it too—indeed, quite a few Spirit-Grade Pills bore pill patterns.”

“Then the compensation… won’t that have to be multiplied?”

“The Nine Heavens Sacred Land seems to only ask for the value of a normal Spirit-Linking Pill as payment, but of course if you give more they won’t refuse.”

“Naturally you give more to leave a good impression—next time it’ll be easier to get help. Heh heh, I prepared extra compensation. Maybe I’ll get lucky and the pill I ask for will sprout a pattern.”

“That master is miraculous… at least a Middle-Level Saint-Grade alchemist, I’d say. Apart from Elder Tianzang, he might be the most formidable in the world.”

“It seems there’s more than one Saint-grade alchemist here…”

“Why do you say that?”

“Haven’t you noticed how fast they refine pills? Every day they manage at least ten refinements, and those pills are Upper-Level Spirit-Grade or better—so many Saint-Grade pills. How could a single master keep up?”

“Could the Nine Heavens Sacred Land be hiding several masters of such caliber?”

At that, everyone shivered in astonishment.

Saint-Grade alchemists are incredibly scarce; every faction hopes to have such a master serve their sect, but very few forces are so fortunate. Even if they have one, those alchemists only serve their own sect, never refining for outsiders. They are exalted and may take months or a year between tasks, living leisurely and enjoying life’s pleasures.

By contrast, the Sacred Land’s alchemist had been so busy this month that he scarcely had time to drink water—a benefactor to the world, revered and adored.

Such murmured talk spread everywhere among the waiting warriors, all amazed at the Sacred Land’s depth.

The only regret was that the Sacred Land’s masters would refine only one pill per person—no more.

But masters are peculiar by nature, and the petitioners could understand.

After a while, a group emerged from within the Nine Peaks—ten people, neither more nor fewer. Regardless of age or cultivation, each held themselves tall, radiant and utterly satisfied.

“They’re out—the batch who went in yesterday!” came cries from the line.

A curious bystander called loudly: “Friends, how did your pills turn out?”

Among the ten, an elderly man laughed heartily: “The Sacred Land’s master is worthy of his name—our ten requests all succeeded without failure, and my lower-level Saint Pill even developed a pill pattern, ha ha ha!”

He threw back his head and laughed, triumphant and elated.

The other nine looked at him with envy.

Those still in line were stupefied, eyes bloodshot as they stared at the old man, itching to rush and knock him unconscious to seize that Saint Pill.

A Saint Pill with a pill pattern is a once in a century treasure, its value incalculable.

Yet when they saw the old man’s cultivation, their thoughts were dashed.

The old fellow was at least a Second Stage Saint Realm expert.

“Please wait; I wish you all the same luck. I’ll be off now!” The old man was unusually cheerful. Normally people of his stature spoke little and looked down on others, but today he chatted amiably.

Saying this, Luo Sheng and Meng Tianfei—the elders who had been maintaining order outside—politely cupped their fists and quickly departed.

After he had gone some distance, those still in line seemed to awaken from a dream, their eyes shining with eager expectation.

“Elders, can we send people in now? I’ve waited days—this is my turn.” Someone at the front shouted.

Luo Sheng and Meng Tianfei exchanged a glance and nodded slightly. Luo Sheng called out loudly: “The ten friends at the front of the line, please follow our disciples into the guest hall. You will be attended to there. After these ten, please continue to wait!”

“This way, please!” a Sacred Land disciple gestured ahead.

The ten at the front surged forward like injected with stimulants, pushing and jostling without restraint, and in the blink of an eye they were gone.

The others continued to stand in the long line, burning with impatience.

The two elders stepped aside and watched the heartening scene with great satisfaction.

“Brother Meng, where on earth did the Saint Lord find this alchemist? His level is absurdly high.”

Meng Tianfei shook his head. “Ask me and I’ll ask whom? I’ve discussed this with the Great Elder—he isn’t clear either about who the master is or where he came from. Most likely the Saint Lord befriended them in his travels.”

"Impressive... To have a master of that caliber serve the Sacred Land, the Saint Lord's methods must be truly extraordinary!"

“Indeed. Thanks to the compensation from these pill requests, the Sacred Land’s situation has improved. Disciples no longer worry about cultivation materials. Heh heh, if that master would refine Saint Pills for you and me someday, that would be splendid.”

“Don’t get ahead of yourself—ask the Saint Lord someday and it’ll be fine.”

“That said, I wonder when that master will ever be free…”

As they spoke, their gazes turned to a group approaching the Nine Heavens Sacred Land.

There was no doubt this group had come to request pills as well.

A batch went in and another came out—the numbers would only rise.

The two elders were both happy and troubled, sighing deeply.

The newcomers numbered four or five. When they neared, Luo Sheng stepped forward to instruct them, placing them at the end of the queue.

In recent days, Luo Sheng and Meng Tianfei had to host at least two or three such waves of guests daily, and the stream of arrivals showed an increasing trend.

No sooner had those few been arranged than Xu Hui burst out of the Nine Peaks at speed.

Their expressions changed as they hurried to meet him.

Soon, Elder Xu Hui arrived outside the peaks and looked at the long queue—astonished: “So many?”

“Yes, Elder. The Sacred Land’s alchemy reputation grows ever louder,” Luo Sheng said wryly.

“Naturally. A spotless record is itself a legend—no other alchemist in the world can claim it, except our Sacred Land’s master!” Xu Hui’s tone brimmed with pride.

“Elder, did you come to issue an order?” Meng Tianfei asked.

“Mm—bring word from the Saint Lord.” Xu Hui nodded and shouted to the line: “Friends, I am Xu Hui, Elder of the Nine Heavens Sacred Land—salutations!”

The crowd hastily returned the salute, showing no disrespect.

Xu Hui’s visage lit with a rare vigor; he had never felt so grandly conspicuous, not even when the old Saint Lord was alive.

He continued loudly: “By order of our Saint Lord, may I ask if any of you possess Heaven-and-Earth Spiritual Objects?”

Most shook their heads, saying they had none. Some whispered guesses among themselves about what the Saint Lord wanted this thing for.
