## Chapter 1618 — Situation Looks Grim

Elder Jiu was clearly trying to curry favor; he was dying for Yang Kai to borrow some Saint Crystals from him, and if Yang Kai accepted that favor everything could be smoothed over later. After all, once someone accepts another's generosity they become indebted and are unlikely to be harsh.

"I also have quite a few Saint Crystals here," Li Wanning said, pursing her lips into a faint smile.

Yang Kai's mouth twitched; he ignored them—he knew full well what they were scheming.

If he actually borrowed Saint Crystals from them at this moment, the debt would be enormous; this matter concerned Qian Tong's promotion and was crucial to whether he could break through to the Void King Realm.

"How many Saint Crystals do you have?" Yang Kai asked, turning to look at Yang Xiuzhu and the others.

Yang Xiuzhu and Chu Hanyi exchanged glances, each taking out their Saint Crystals and handing them to Yang Kai.

"Only this much," Yang Kai said, his Divine Sense sweeping over them as he roughly counted, brow knitting.

The combined total of the few people's Saint Crystals amounted to only about five million.

That amount wasn't negligible; after all, it could already satisfy everyone's cultivation needs. Besides, when they left Dark Star, the Saint Crystals requisitioned from the Sect were basically kept under Yang Kai's custody.

And those Saint Crystals had long since been used up on the Tongxuan Continent when Little Senior Sister refined Stellar Origin.

Yang Kai himself didn't have many Saint Crystals either!

He couldn't help feeling awkward and hurriedly began rummaging through his Spatial Ring.

He retrieved the storages belonging to Mi Tian, Xue Lian, Lie Feng and the others, pooled their Saint Crystals together—but even combined they were only on the order of ten million!

They had come for the Blood Prison Trial; who would carry so many Saint Crystals on their person for no reason?

"Is that enough? If not, I can lend you some," Xu Binbai said, seeing the worried look on Yang Kai's face and stepping forward.

"How can I accept that?" Yang Kai smiled awkwardly; he had never expected that one day he'd be troubled over Saint Crystals. In the past he had spent them without counting, squandering them at will.

"It's nothing, Saint Crystals are just external possessions," Xu Binbai grinned. "But I don't have much either—only twenty million."

"That should be enough," Yang Kai nodded. "Thanks in advance, Brother Xu."

"Don't mention it. One day I may have occasion to call on you, Brother Yang. When that day comes, please don't refuse," Xu Binbai said with a smile, handing a Spatial Ring to Yang Kai.

Yang Kai accepted it and nodded to him. "I won't forget your kindness, Brother Xu. If you ever need anything of me, just ask."

"I hope the day we meet again will come," Xu Binbai said with a faint smile.

In total there were a little over thirty million Saint Crystals. That number was not small, but it was by no means abundant.

However, it should be enough for Qian Tong's breakthrough; the Spiritual Qi on this wasteland was only somewhat thin, not truly barren.

Seeing that Yang Kai would rather borrow Saint Crystals from Xu Binbai than ask them, the many Void King Realm experts exchanged glances and slowly shook their heads, utterly helpless.

Yang Kai knew what they were thinking—how could they not know what he was thinking?

He didn't say much. Elder Jiu only offered a well-meaning reminder: "Kid, if you plan to send Saint Crystals in, you must go and return quickly. The terror of ascending to the Void King Realm is beyond your imagination; stay inside too long and even you will be affected."

"Thanks for the warning, senior!" Yang Kai inclined his head slightly, took a deep breath, his figure trembling, and suddenly vanished from where he stood.

The next moment he had become a streak of lightning, hurtling straight toward the dark clouds beneath.

Everyone watched him intently, their gazes unblinking.

Countless large and small tornadoes raced across the land. Yang Kai's figure flickered, weaving among them as he approached at extreme speed.

Qian Tong's field of Shi spreading outside his body became the greatest obstacle to Yang Kai's advance.

A mature Shi field almost rivaled the power of a Domain field. Fortunately, Yang Kai had frequently plunged into domain whirlpools during the Blood Prison trials; this difficulty could not stop him. He merged his own Shi into the field and met little resistance, moving with flowing ease.

He did not even disturb Qian Tong.

"This kid really has a trick up his sleeve!" Elder Jiu's eyes sparkled.

"He actually merged his own Shi into another's field. It seems his comprehension of Shi has far outstripped that of many at the Third Stage of the Origin Returning Realm!"

"Give him some time and he will definitely reach the Void King Realm!"

In just ten or so breaths, Yang Kai had already rushed to within a short distance of Qian Tong.

Qian Tong sat cross-legged on the ground. When Yang Kai arrived, he seemed to sense it and opened his eyes — but upon seeing that it was Yang Kai, he calmly closed them again, remaining motionless and steady as a boulder.

Yang Kai did not dare delay. His Divine Sense flared as he took out all the pooled Saint Crystals from the Spatial Rings and piled them around Qian Tong, encircling him three layers in and three layers out, nearly impenetrable.

"Elder Qian, take this—perhaps it will help you at the critical moment," Yang Kai said, tossing a jade vial that landed steadily in front of Qian Tong.

Having done all this, he immediately hurried back.

In a moment, Yang Kai returned to his original spot.

No sooner had he steadied his footing than an astonishing fluctuation of energy came from that direction.

A pillar of pure white light suddenly shot up to the heavens, and as the pillar was born, the thirty million Saint Crystals Yang Kai had scattered all burst into dazzling radiance, seemingly drawn by something as their internal energy vented and converged—pouring into the column and surging up into the storm clouds above.

The clouds became even denser and more solid.

Muffled thunder could be heard from within, reverberating and shaking the heart.

Crack—

A thunderclap boomed, deafeningly loud, as a torrent of heaven and earth’s might — like a soaring jiao dragon — descended from the sky without warning, striking Qian Tong squarely and flooding into his body, cleansing his meridians and tempering his flesh.

"It's begun!" Luo Hai called in a low voice, his gaze fixed and deep.

Qian Tong's breakthrough had finally commenced!

A wondrous profound intent spread as the ascent began, causing everyone present to look thoughtful; each strove to savor that layer of intent, hoping to gain benefit for themselves.

This was the profound intent present when one rose to the Void King Realm. The scene before them was exactly such an ascension; watching it over would surely be of great benefit to their own growth.

The first surge of heaven-and-earth power struck so violently that the land trembled; within a radius of ten thousand li the ground roared, dust flew, and the air turned chaotic, giving people the terrible feeling that neither heaven nor earth was as it should be.

Such a force made most at the Origin Returning Realm turn pale.

Putting themselves in his place, they realized that with their current strength, they would stand no chance — just a single encounter, and they’d be reduced to dust!

Is a Void King Realm breakthrough really this terrifying?

Some people's confidence was badly shaken, while others' eyes shone with a burning desire for the future and for power.

The Void King Realm experts, while apparently focused on Qian Tong, were actually observing the reactions of these martial artists, seeking talent they might cultivate.

The second heaven-and-earth force struck, followed by a third, a fourth...

It came like a raging storm — fierce and unrelenting, with almost no pause between the strikes.

Qian Tong's low, beast-like roar echoed over there—anyone could imagine the immense pressure he was bearing.

His own Shi surged wildly as countless small and large whirlwinds coiled around him; the profound essence of his Shi was gradually ascending, undergoing a transformative evolution.

Time passed slowly; Yang Kai and the others wore anxious expressions.

From Qian Tong's roaring, Yang Kai could infer some things: Elder Qian's burden seemed to grow ever greater. Subjected to the countless baptisms of heaven-and-earth power, his breath grew weaker and his life force dimmer.

It was as if he were a lone boat braving a furious storm on a raging sea—Qian Tong stood on the verge of annihilation at any moment.

"Things are not looking good!" Elder Jiu's face showed concern.

"Yes, the baptism he's enduring seems far stronger than the one I experienced," Li Wanning said, frowning.

“The stronger the Baptism one endures, the greater the heights they can reach in the future. The might of this Baptism differs for every cultivator ascending to the Void King Realm. If they withstand it, the skies open wide before them; if they fail, their soul and spirit scatter into nothingness,” Luo Hai sighed softly. “Throughout history, countless geniuses have perished at this very threshold. Advancing through the earlier major realms of the Martial Dao is one thing—but from the Saint King Realm to the Origin Returning Realm onward, each great breakthrough is a battle fought with one’s very life!”

Everyone nodded in agreement.

They were all old masters; who did not understand these truths?

What Luo Hai said was true. Since the Saint King Realm's breakthrough to the Origin Returning Realm, cultivators had been gambling their lives with heavens; the only possible end for failure in a great-realm breakthrough was death!

There was no other outcome!

Once the heaven-and-earth power is summoned, one either is reborn under that fierce baptism or perishes and the Dao is extinguished.

Elder Jiu glanced at Yang Kai and, after a long moment of thought, said: "Kid, you must steel yourself—at present the situation is not optimistic."

Yang Kai turned to look at him and gave a short, wry laugh. "Elder Qian will succeed."

Elder Jiu shook his head. “Wishing for something doesn’t always make it so. This old man hopes he succeeds as well, but…”

He did not finish; it was obvious he was not confident in Qian Tong's prospects.

Yang Xiuzhu and the others immediately became tense.

The five of them had followed Yang Kai off Dark Star to Cuiwei Star, arriving at the Blood Prison Trial that comes once in a thousand years. Qian Tong's fortune was deep; now he finally had the qualification and opportunity to touch the Void King Realm—no one wished to see him fail like this.

If he succeeded, Qian Tong would become the first Void King Realm expert Dark Star had produced in tens of thousands of years.

Even if his ascension took place on another Cultivation Star, that would be enough to let Yang Xiuzhu and the others glimpse a bright future.

The heaven-and-earth power continued to rain down, battering Qian Tong; his roars grew weaker, and his vitality and breath fluttered like a candle in wind...

"Ah, it looks like he won't make it," the old woman surnamed Lei suddenly shook her head, regret showing on her face.

"Yes, such a pity; he had come so far," Elder Jiu agreed with a nod.

By their senses, Qian Tong's life force was already waning, his breath at its lowest ebb—to say his days were numbered would be no exaggeration.

If nothing unexpected happened, this man would surely die!
