## Chapter 2347 — Desperate Measures

Inside the side room, Yang Kai sent his Divine Sense into the Slave-Insect Bracelet to check on the condition of the Soul-Devouring Worms.

The performance of the Soul-Devouring Worms in today’s battle left him extremely satisfied, even exceeding his expectations.

These insects are truly weapons for group combat! Not even experts of the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm could withstand their assault. If he nurtured them a bit longer and let them evolve once more, perhaps even those in the Emperor Realm would have to retreat before them.

But nurturing the Soul-Devouring Worms took far too long, and the cost was certainly not small. Yang Kai needed to purchase large quantities of Spiritual Herbs to throw into the Slave-Insect Bracelet, letting this Imperial Treasure convert the medicinal effects into nutrients suitable for the Soul-Devouring Worms’ growth.

This kind of thing couldn’t be rushed.

The Soul-Devouring Worms ranked very high in the Strange Insects Manual, at eleventh on the Heavenly List. His Slave-Insect Bracelet still contained many other strange insects and exotic beasts. Though none ranked as high as the Soul-Devouring Worms, they should still be able to play a significant role.

Yang Kai thought that if he had time, he should find an opportunity to study those strange insects and exotic beasts sealed within the Slave-Insect Bracelet. Perhaps, at some point, they could produce miraculous effects.

In today’s battle, the Soul-Devouring Worms devoured quite a bit of warriors’ Divine Sense and Origin Qi, and seemed to have grown somewhat, though not very noticeably.

But now, the Soul-Devouring Worms could even devour Origin Qi, which greatly surprised Yang Kai. Previously, they could only consume the power of Divine Sense, so it was clear they had grown considerably.

Three days later, Ye Hen came to visit.

Yang Kai naturally received him warmly.

The situation in Thousand Leaves Sect was now settled. All the disciples who had died or been injured had been properly cared for. Though the sect suffered heavy losses this time, it might not be a bad thing. The faction led by Shi Cangying had been completely wiped out, and those remaining were all loyal disciples and elders. Now, the entire Thousand Leaves Sect was united. With the Heavenly Puppets available for use, given time, they would surely restore their former glory.

Ye Hen’s injuries had not yet healed. The battle a few days ago had left him exhausted, and when Yang Kai saw him, his face was still pale and his aura unstable. Ye Qinghan had been by his side the whole time.

Yang Kai also knew exactly why he had come, so after they sat down he didn’t waste words and handed Ye Hen the ring Ye Chong had entrusted to him.

Ye Hen took it with trembling hands, looking at Yang Kai with hope, longing for the answer he wanted to hear.

Yang Kai smiled and said, “This is the ring Senior Ye Chong entrusted to me. It should contain many of your sect’s techniques and secret inheritances.”

Hearing this, Ye Hen’s body shook, and tears streamed down his face.

The wish of his ancestors for tens of thousands of years had finally been fulfilled in his generation. But soon, he realized something was wrong and exclaimed, “Young Master Yang, did you just say that it was Old Ancestor Ye Chong who entrusted you with this ring? Could it be...?”

Yang Kai waved his hand and said, “Senior Ye Chong passed away long ago. I only communicated with a remnant of his Divine Sense. He instructed me to bring this ring to you.”

After Yang Kai recounted what happened in the secret realm, Ye Hen was shocked and muttered, “Old Ancestor Ye Chong actually delved into the path of Corpse Puppets. This...”

If not for Yang Kai’s words, he wouldn’t have believed it. The art of Corpse Puppets was a forbidden technique in Thousand Leaves Sect, so why would Ye Chong study it? And he even refined himself into a Corpse Puppet. But Yang Kai clearly had no reason to deceive him, and the fact that he brought out Ye Chong’s ring explained everything.

After a long daze, Ye Hen finally stood up and bowed deeply, “Young Master Yang has shown great kindness to everyone in Thousand Leaves Sect. Ye Hen will never forget it. Please accept my bow!”

Ye Qinghan hurriedly bowed as well.

Yang Kai helped him up and said, “Sect Master Ye, you’re too serious. It was just a small favor.”

Ye Hen knew this was no small favor. Yang Kai had entered the secret realm and encountered Ye Chong’s Corpse Puppet. He must have gone through an earth-shattering battle, though Yang Kai didn’t elaborate on the details, and Ye Hen didn’t know how dangerous it truly was.

“From now on, Young Master Yang is a friend of Thousand Leaves Sect. If you ever need anything, our sect will never refuse!” Ye Hen said solemnly.

Yang Kai smiled, “Sect Master Ye, why not first see if what’s inside the ring is what you’re hoping for?”

“Alright!” Ye Hen was eager to know if the lost techniques and secret arts of the sect were inside, so he immediately began to break the ring’s restriction, not caring about appearances at all.

Ye Qinghan stood to the side, watching with both anticipation and anxiety.

The ring required bloodline power to open, so the restriction wasn’t difficult to break. But if someone tried to force it without bloodline power, the ring would be destroyed instantly.

In less than ten breaths, a streak of light flashed across the ancient Spatial Ring, and Yang Kai knew the restriction had been broken.

Ye Hen’s Divine Sense surged as he investigated the ring, his expression constantly changing.

After a long while, Ye Hen withdrew his Divine Sense and let out a heavy sigh.

“Father...” Seeing his expression, Ye Qinghan’s heart skipped a beat, thinking the contents of the ring had disappointed him, and her pretty face changed color.

Ye Hen waved his hand and said, “Everything that was lost is here.”

“Then why are you still sighing, Father?” Ye Qinghan looked at Ye Hen in confusion. Recovering the lost techniques and secret arts was a good thing—it meant Thousand Leaves Sect could gradually grow stronger and would never again be powerless.

Ye Hen gave a bitter smile, “It’s nothing. Qinghan, you go on ahead. I have some things to discuss with Young Master Yang.”

Ye Qinghan hesitated for a moment, then nodded, “Alright.”

She nodded to Yang Kai and slowly withdrew.

After Ye Qinghan left, Ye Hen looked at Yang Kai with a troubled expression, as if he found it hard to speak.

“Sect Master Ye, feel free to speak your mind,” Yang Kai said with a slight smile.

Ye Hen said, “Then I’ll be blunt... May I ask what Young Master Yang thinks of my daughter Qinghan?”

As soon as Yang Kai heard this, he sensed trouble, but he still answered honestly, “Miss Ye is resolute and kind-hearted. She’s quite good.”

He had interacted with Ye Qinghan for some time, and though they weren’t close, Yang Kai’s impression of her was very positive.

“And in Young Master Yang’s eyes, how would you rate my daughter’s appearance?” Ye Hen pressed on.

Yang Kai thought, is this old man serious? After pondering, he said, “Those who love her would naturally see her as a peerless beauty. Sect Master Ye, I’m afraid you won’t get an answer from me on this. Why not ask Brother Du Xian?”

Hearing this, Ye Hen stopped beating around the bush and cupped his fists, “Young Master Yang, I earnestly ask you to marry my daughter and take charge of Thousand Leaves Sect! I’ve heard you have no sect, and I am willing...”

Before he could finish, Yang Kai raised his hand and said calmly, “Sect Master Ye, I’m not one to break up lovers, and I have no intention of joining Thousand Leaves Sect.”

Ye Hen gave a bitter smile, “Young Master Yang must think I’m the kind of person who would sacrifice my daughter’s happiness for my own gain. But... my time is short, and no one in Thousand Leaves Sect is fit to be Sect Master. If I pass away, what will become of the sect?”

Yang Kai frowned, “Du Xian is a fine successor.”

Ye Hen sighed, “Du Xian is indeed good, but his cultivation is still lacking!”

Yang Kai smiled, “Du Xian is at the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. May I ask, Sect Master Ye, what was your cultivation when you took over as sect master?”

Ye Hen was stunned. Thinking back, when he became sect master, he was only at the First Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. Du Xian was a whole stage higher than he had been.

Yang Kai continued, “Besides, now your sect can use the Heavenly Puppets again, and all the experts within a million li are gone. What is there to fear, Sect Master Ye?”

Ye Hen’s eyes gradually brightened, and he nodded, “Young Master Yang is right. With the Heavenly Puppets available again, what do I have to fear? If only I had ten more years, I could surely advance to Emperor. If that happened, Thousand Leaves Sect would truly have nothing to fear.”

Yang Kai’s expression shifted, “Sect Master Ye, do you think ten years is enough to reach Emperor?”

Ye Hen smiled, “The technique I cultivated was flawed, but now I have Old Ancestor Ye Chong’s legacy. If I can’t reach Emperor in ten years, I’ve lived in vain.”

To have reached the Third Stage of the Dao Origin Realm with a flawed technique—Yang Kai now understood that Ye Hen’s talent was truly top-notch, only his background was lacking. Now, with the lost techniques and secret arts, he could make up for that flaw.

Ten years might really be enough for him to reach Emperor.

“It’s just... I don’t have that much time,” Ye Hen sighed heavily, lamenting his ill fate. It was precisely because his days were numbered that he came up with such a poor idea, wanting Yang Kai to marry Ye Qinghan. But now, after Yang Kai’s guidance, his mind was clear, and he no longer dwelled on it.

After speaking, Ye Hen stood up, “Sorry to trouble you today, Young Master Yang. I want to go see that secret realm, so I’ll take my leave.”

Yang Kai said, “If that’s the case, Sect Master Ye, take care.”

After a pause, he seemed to remember something and said, “Sect Master Ye, I might need your help in a few days.”

Ye Hen smiled, “If Young Master Yang needs my help, it’s an honor for me and Thousand Leaves Sect. Just say the word.”

“Then I’ll thank you in advance, Sect Master Ye.”

Ye Hen came for two reasons: first, to ask if Yang Kai had obtained the lost techniques and secret arts, which he was now satisfied with; second, to propose marriage for Ye Qinghan, but was refused by Yang Kai.

But after being refused, he wasn’t disappointed—he actually felt relieved.

He had always noticed the feelings between Ye Qinghan and Du Xian, and knew they were well-matched. If Yang Kai had agreed to marry Ye Qinghan, Ye Hen would never be able to face his daughter and disciple again—they would hate him for life.

He had only made the proposal for the sake of the sect.

Now, thinking back, he realized he had acted out of desperation.

From beginning to end, he hadn’t asked about Liu Yan, as if he hadn’t seen her controlling the Heavenly Puppets, nor did he ask about her origins or why she came out of the secret realm with Yang Kai.
