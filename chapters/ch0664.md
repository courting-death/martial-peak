## Chapter 664 — Demon God Transformation

The Wordless Black Book was something Yang Kai came upon by accident; at first it looked nothing more than a pillow.

But one night, a refusal to yield in his sleep unlocked the mysteries of the Wordless Black Book.

Yang Kai could confirm the original owner of the black book was the Great Demon God because Han Fei had told him a story about it a few days earlier.

She had said that back then the Great Demon God obtained a massive slab of Soul-Calming Stone from somewhere; no one knew what it had been used for, but some scraps and fragments were left over, and those scraps were combined with other precious materials to forge four Void Rings for the four chief commanders.

Now it seemed that the large slab of Soul-Calming Stone the Great Demon God had acquired back then had been used to make the Wordless Black Book. The materials of the black book and those used for the Void Rings in the hands of the four commanders came from the same source!

If that was so, then the owner of the Indomitable Golden Body must have been the Great Demon God as well.

He had tried to leap out of this world and ascend to a higher plane of existence but failed; his flesh was destroyed while his bones remained. Because those bones belonged to the Great Demon God, the Indomitable Golden Body was imbued with malignant power.

The Indomitable Golden Body Technique, the incense burner, the True Yang Technique, the Wan Yao Ling Milk series, the World-Ending Demon Eye—all of these had been arranged by the Great Demon God.

Only that Yang Kai’s path of growth had deviated somewhat from his design.

In Yao Wang Valley he had obtained the True Alchemy Formula, which was not something the Great Demon God had intended to give him.

Perhaps the Great Demon God wanted his successor to devote himself wholly to martial cultivation, undistracted by alchemy.

As he pondered this, Yang Kai’s eyes brightened; suddenly he recalled another matter.

Guan'er had once told him that among the Ancient Demon Clan there had appeared a top-tier alchemist, one whom no other pill master could match.

If so, then that alchemist must also have been the Great Demon God—otherwise, where would the True Alchemy Formula have come from?

Though merely conjecture, it was a very plausible one.

Yang Kai’s eyes glittered as his thoughts raced; he carefully sifted through the information he possessed, and his mind grew clear.

"Lady Li, although he possesses the World-Ending Demon Eye, handing our clan over to him on that basis alone seems rather hasty, does it not?"

Having left the stone chamber, Hua Mo suddenly spoke in a low voice, his face full of concern. Although he had been quite excited when he saw the World-Ending Demon Eye, upon further reflection he still felt Li Rong’s decision might have been improper.

"Indeed, there are many doubts about him. One World-Ending Demon Eye alone proves nothing, and most crucially, he is human…" Han Fei nodded gently in agreement with Hua Mo.

Li Rong smiled faintly. "If the World-Ending Demon Eye chose him, then it is the decision of the Great Demon God; we only need to follow our ancestral precepts. Besides, he is human now—what he will become in the future is uncertain."

Hua Mo and Han Fei were taken aback by her words and fell silent.

"Still, his conduct has been satisfactory," Hua Mo murmured after a moment of thought. "I expected a young man so hot-headed to leap at the chance when he heard the Ancient Demon Clan would swear fealty to him, yet he refused."

He had not only refused; from beginning to end he had shown little excitement.

It seemed that whether the Ancient Demon Clan pledged allegiance meant nothing to him.

If he were only foolish and lacking confidence, that might explain it, but more likely he had weathered many storms, seen himself clearly, and had a profound self-awareness.

Someone like that could not be both foolish and lacking in confidence; the image of him slaying Chu Jian still flashed through Hua Mo’s mind, making him chill.

The only remaining explanation was that he knew himself well and would not take rash action without absolute certainty.

People like that tended to rely solely on their own strength to accomplish things and would not pin their hopes on uncontrollable aid.

"Which proves the Great Demon God’s judgment is unfailing," Li Rong said with a bright smile. "Mark my words: within five years our clan will be able to leave this Small Xuan Realm and see the world our ancestors once lived in."

Hua Mo and Han Fei’s expressions changed; anticipation shone in their eyes.

How many years had it been since the Great Demon God was sealed in this Small Xuan Realm? At least several thousand. The world had long forgotten that there was a clan who had once served the Great Demon God as his most loyal servants. The records of the days and nights, the stars, the great rivers and seas could only be imagined by the clan; none had seen those wondrous scenes.

Every clan member’s lifelong dream was to leave and witness those wonders for themselves.

"I hope to see that day in my lifetime," Hua Mo said, taking a deep breath to steady his excitement.

…………

At Mo Shen Fort, inside an octagonal tower, the building was not especially tall but its design was unique and elegant; decorations hung from each of the tower’s eight eaves and the wooden windows were carved with many images of birds and beasts.

Under Guan'er's guidance, Yang Kai strolled into the octagonal tower.

After a night of contemplation, Yang Kai had sorted out his threads of thought.

No matter what the Ancient Demon Clan planned to do, his own goal had always been to become stronger and that had never changed; only by surpassing everyone else could he endure in this world, and only by becoming stronger than all could he do as he pleased, unbound by others.

Thus the attitude of the Ancient Demon Clan towards him was of no consequence; he only needed to persist on his own path.

"The Lady is inside; go in yourself," Guan'er gestured and waited outside the door.

Yang Kai nodded slightly and stepped forward.

Inside the attic Li Rong sat behind a table; when she saw Yang Kai arrive, she rose quickly and came to greet him with a smile. "You've come."

"Mm."

"The things have been prepared for you." Li Rong pointed to several secret manuals on the table. "These are all about Demon God Transformation; you may read them at will."

"Thank you."

Li Rong’s beautiful eyes glittered and she pursed her lips with a smile. "I can honor your request and stop calling you 'My Lord,' but you needn’t be so formal with us; it makes things feel too distant."

Yang Kai remained unreadable; after a moment’s thought he said, "Then let us put each other at ease."

Li Rong smiled faintly.

Yang Kai stepped forward, picked up the manuals, and sat in the chair Li Rong had previously occupied, beginning to leaf through them.

Indeed, these manuals were all about Demon God Transformation, instructing the clan’s members how to cultivate the Demon God Transformation, how to guide the Demon Mark’s expansion, and how to use it to enhance their combat power.

Each volume was exceedingly precious and not all clan members could access these secrets.

Yang Kai read only a short while before his eyes brightened and joy filled his face.

These manuals contained profound insights into Demon God Transformation; without exception they expounded the very essence of the Demon God Transformation.

Yang Kai treated them as treasures, soon becoming wholly absorbed and studying them day and night.

Seeing him so quickly get into the state, Li Rong smiled and went out to pour a cup of fragrant tea to set by his side, then sat quietly nearby to wait.

Focusing his consciousness on the Demon Mark, guiding its spread across his body, he would use his own malignant power to awaken the potential within the Demon Mark so it could strengthen him.

In the initial stage the Demon Mark merely spread over the body, just as Yang Kai’s current Demon God Transformation displayed.

At the Second-Tier Stage the Demon Mark would be refined into the flesh; by then, even when the Demon God Transformation was displayed, the outward appearance would show no difference.

What Li Rong wanted from Yang Kai was to advance to the Second-Tier Stage as soon as possible; at that stage, even if he performed the Demon God Transformation in front of Ancient Demon Clan members, it would not affect them or render them unable to move or summon strength.

At the Third-Tier Stage the Demon Mark would be fully integrated into the bones, and the enhancement it brought would be even greater and mightier.

Yang Kai read with rapt attention; having experienced the Demon God Transformation many times himself, he quickly grasped the essentials recorded in the manuals.

The rest could only be obtained through practice and cultivation.

Taking a deep breath, Yang Kai set down the final manual before him; after a long moment he opened his eyes, burning with spirit, and looked at Li Rong. "Is there a place in Mo Shen Fort suitable for me to go into seclusion and cultivate the Demon God Transformation?"

"It’s been prepared for some time." Li Rong smiled and gestured, "Come with me."

She walked to a nearby bookcase and with a casual sweep the shelf creaked and turned, revealing a doorway that led downward.

Li Rong slipped through the opening with a flash and Yang Kai followed close behind.

Below there was clearly a secret chamber; torches lined the passage and the light was not dark.

After traveling a very long way, a vast empty chamber suddenly appeared before Yang Kai’s eyes. This chamber was even larger than the stone chamber he had used for alchemy.

Around the edges stood rows of jet-black stones; vaguely, Yang Kai sensed a subtle energy emanating from them.

"This is where I normally cultivate my Martial Skills. Here you can boldly perform the Demon God Transformation without worrying about affecting my clan members," Li Rong explained softly, pointing at the black pillars. "Those are Silent-Sealing Stones; they are born capable of restraining the transmission of energy. When you enter I will extend a formation through them."

"I understand. Let’s begin at once." Yang Kai was impatient; the words had barely left his mouth before he shot forward and landed steadily in the center.

Li Rong shook her head with a smile and murmured, "So impatient!"

As she spoke she casually formed streams of energy, sending them into the Silent-Sealing Stones. Very quickly, a translucent semicircular barrier descended and entirely encompassed the area circled by the stones.

Yang Kai looked at Li Rong; she lightly nodded.

Yang Kai removed his upper robe, sat cross-legged, and pressed the middle finger of his right hand to his forehead.

"Enter Demonic State!"

Heaven and earth trembled; ripples and waves swept across the barrier formed by the Silent-Sealing Stones.

With his chest bared, black Demon Marks rapidly emerged upon Yang Kai’s skin; the marks slithered like living serpents, crawling over his body and composing a complex, eerie pattern.

The power of his qi and blood rose wildly; his combat ability soared.

Yang Kai felt with absolute clarity how powerful he had become in that moment.

From afar Li Rong watched with unusual light in her beautiful eyes, staring as if entranced and whispering, "Indeed, there is something different."
