## Chapter 408 — My Stake

Using True Yuan to etch marks on jade to convey messages that are inconvenient to express through words is no great technique; it merely demands strict control over True Yuan.

So when Yang Zhen saw Yang Kai take out two pieces of jade, he immediately knew there must be something significant inside.

Probing with his Divine Sense, he carefully examined them.

Suddenly, Yang Zhen’s brow furrowed, and his gaze turned grave. After a moment, his eyes filled with confusion, then shifted to astonishment and shock.

His changing expression was remarkable.

The elderly men in the hall, who had originally intended to watch the spectacle with detached amusement, were stunned when they saw Yang Zhen’s face. They began to suspect he had discovered something extraordinary.

After a long while, Yang Zhen drew a deep breath and slowly withdrew his Divine Sense from the jade. He looked at Yang Kai with a peculiar expression, then solemnly picked up the other piece of jade.

He examined it in the same manner as before, as if replaying a recorded event, and the myriad expressions on his face played out again.

At this, the white-haired elders in the hall could no longer remain seated. One by one, they quietly rose and gathered around.

In moments, Yang Kai was pushed out of the outermost ring. The old men clustered together, waiting for Yang Zhen to withdraw his Divine Sense.

“What exactly is inside?” one elder could no longer contain his curiosity. Not knowing what Yang Kai had brought that could elicit such attention from Yang Zhen, he reached for one piece of jade on the table.

Before he could grab it, Yang Zhen snatched it back, earning a glare.

“That brat, come here!” Yang Zhen waved his hand, brusquely pushing the prying elders aside.

“I am here,” Yang Kai stepped forward. Technically, Yang Zhen belonged to the grandfather’s generation, but within the Yang Family, they did not address each other by kinship unless they shared a close relationship.

Holding two pieces of jade, Yang Zhen frowned, his old face flushing as he muttered, “What are these things?”

“You don’t know what they are, yet your reaction was so intense?” one white-haired elder said incredulously, and the others slowly shook their heads, their expectations dampened.

“Two sets of spirit formations.”

“Nonsense.” Yang Zhen snorted sharply. “I’m not an idiot. Of course, I know these are two sets of spirit formations. I asked what purpose they serve.”

As he spoke, his face flushed even redder.

He was old, experienced, and knowledgeable. At this moment, he felt embarrassed that he couldn't identify something brought back by a youngster of the grandson’s generation.

Yang Kai pinched his nose. “Spirit formations used for alchemy!”

Yang Zhen was immediately stunned. “Used for alchemy?”

He shook his head repeatedly. “I have seen many spirit formations used in alchemy, but none as intricate and complex as these two. Carving such formations onto a pill furnace alone is quite troublesome. If these spirit formations are applied during alchemy, they would undoubtedly consume more effort and True Yuan from the alchemist. Are you certain these two sets of spirit formations are effective?”

“Certain!”

“Explain, what exactly can they do?” Yang Zhen frowned as he questioned. Since he wasn’t well-versed in alchemy, he couldn’t discern the wonders and mysteries imbued within the spirit formations. Instead, he instinctively felt they were overly complicated—undoubtedly valuable but with apparent drawbacks.

“One set can increase the success rate of alchemy,” Yang Kai said calmly. “In other words, if an alchemist usually has a sixty percent chance of a successful pill, then with this set, it can rise to ninety percent!”

Yang Zhen was moved.

A ninety percent success rate! Even without much knowledge of alchemy, he understood how exceptional that was. Most alchemists could only guarantee six or seven successful pills out of ten attempts.

A decent alchemist might reach about eighty percent. Students from Yao Wang Valley often achieved this level. Now, a spirit formation could improve the success rate by thirty percent. This meant a competent alchemist could use it to virtually guarantee success every time.

Over time, this could save an enormous amount of materials, time, and energy.

In an instant, Yang Zhen realized just how precious this set of spirit formations was.

Of course, that depended on Yang Kai’s words being true.

“And the other set?” Yang Zhen suppressed his astonishment and asked with effort to sound steady.

“There is a chance to improve the quality of the pills!” Yang Kai replied lightly.

“What do you mean?” Yang Zhen’s brow twitched involuntarily as he pressed for more details, holding his breath. If his understanding was correct, the second set’s value surpassed even the first.

“Normally, when refining a batch of Heaven-Grade Middle-Level pills, this formation provides some chance of producing Heaven-Grade Upper-Level pills,” Yang Kai patiently explained. “The chance isn’t high, but it definitely happens.”

The elders suddenly found themselves breathing faster. They all recognized the significance of this spirit formation.

One elder nervously asked, “What about refining a batch of Mystery-Grade Upper-Level pills?”

Yang Kai shrugged and smiled, “Then it might produce Spirit-Grade pills.”

Spirit-Grade! Those words hammered like war drums in their ears, shaking their eardrums. Each elder stared incredulously at Yang Kai, searching his face for any sign of jest.

Yang Kai met their gaze calmly.

Both spirit formations were derived from his comprehension of the True Alchemy Formula, so it was obvious they had power.

The elder hall fell into complete silence. The old men stood frozen, unsure how to react, each pondering the value of these spirit formations and whether Yang Kai’s claims were true.

After a long moment, Yang Zhen snapped back to reality. His gaze turned stern as he coldly said, “Do you know what punishment awaits those who deceive the Elder Hall? Even if you are a direct descendant of the Yang Family, if you dare spout nonsense here, I can bury you without a trace!”

“If it’s deception, just get someone knowledgeable to verify it,” Yang Kai narrowed his eyes.

“Bold!” Yang Zhen sneered coldly. “Go fetch Cheng Bailian from the pill workshop.”

“Okay.” A stout elder responded and quickly disappeared.

Cheng Bailian, the Yang Family’s chief alchemist! His achievements in alchemy were renowned throughout the world, although he was somewhat inferior to Xiao Fusheng.

Xiao Fusheng was a Mystery-Grade Upper-Level alchemist—the only one of his rank in the whole Han region. Cheng Bailian was only a Mystery-Grade Middle-Level alchemist.

Though only one rank apart, that single rank was as vast as an abyss, leaving Cheng Bailian no choice but to admire Xiao Fusheng from below.

“If you regret it now, you still can change your mind. But once Cheng Bailian arrives, don’t expect any more leniency from me,” Yang Zhen warned sternly, making a final test.

Yang Kai frowned with displeasure. “Elder, I present these two spirit formations hoping to exchange for two Blood Servants’ allegiance, and also to contribute to the Yang Family, as this is my birthplace. If I only wanted two Blood Servants, one set of these spirit formations would suffice; why would I bring two? I trust the elders can discern the true from the false.”

Yang Zhen was startled, thoughtfully nodding. “You might be right. Perhaps I am just too cautious. But let us wait and see the truth. Truth cannot be faked, and lies cannot become truth. Heh heh.”

He furrowed his brow again as he carefully examined the spirit formations on the jades, but no new insights emerged.

An entire hour passed before the stout elder returned, dragging a man around fifty years old with him.

Upon entering the elder hall, the man wore a dark and gloomy expression, seeming quite unhappy.

Before Yang Zhen could say a word, Cheng Bailian snapped angrily, “Yang Zhen! What are you doing? I was in the middle of refining a batch of Xuanqing Pills and was about to open the furnace! Now you call me here at this critical moment, if you don’t compensate me for that batch, I won’t refine for the Yang Family for three months!”

“Compensate! Compensate!” Yang Zhen said through gritted teeth.

Though older and addressed by name so roughly, Yang Zhen dared not be angry. Cheng Bailian was the Yang Family’s chief alchemist; many precious pills depended on him, so despite the massive difference in power, Yang Zhen swallowed his pride.

Alchemists were not to be trifled with—especially skilled ones.

Cheng Bailian snorted lightly. “That batch was Heaven-Grade Upper-Level pills. Not the most precious, but it did take considerable effort. I’ll let it slide this time for fifty thousand taels.”

Yang Zhen’s face darkened further. “Put that aside. Let’s discuss the matter at hand.”

Cheng Bailian nodded and glanced at the standing Yang Kai. “I heard on the way here that this young man brought these two spirit formations?”

“Yes. Judge for yourself if they are really useful.” Yang Zhen handed over the two pieces of jade.

Cheng Bailian took them casually, sneering. “I’ve refined pills for many years and consider myself quite accomplished in alchemy. I’ve studied numerous spirit formations, yet I’ve never heard of such magical spirit formations existing. I think you’re getting more confused with age. You’ve been conned, and now you’re dragging me down with you. If this spreads, where will your old face go?”

“Enough nonsense. Look at them!” Yang Zhen was enraged but had nowhere to vent his frustration. His face turned purple. He silently swore he would not go easy if Yang Kai was fooling him.

Cheng Bailian finally found a seat and leisurely released his Divine Sense into the jade, beginning his inspection.

Everyone in the elder hall, except Yang Kai, eagerly watched him, curious about his judgment.

Suddenly, as soon as Cheng Bailian’s Divine Sense entered the jade, he let out a strange shout. Rising from his seat in surprise, his face was filled with incredulity.

Everyone held their breath, tensely awaiting what would come. His call startled them all.
