## Chapter 1231 — A Blessing Flies In

In the flightless Flowing Flame Sandland, in an instant he surged three to five li — such a secret art was formidable, and it wasn't over: Lu Ye's aura flashed and he surged another three li.

Yang Kai's face hardened; stunned by the opponent's endless arsenal of strange methods, he was also deeply wary.

He had even used the Space Blade and still failed to cut the man in two; instead the man escaped with his life. Moreover, that black ruler — whatever kind of Secret Treasure it was — with a casual wave required two drops of his Golden Blood just to counter.

Origin-Grade Secret Treasures were not this potent; the only explanation was that the black ruler in the man's hand was a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure!

Liu Yun Valley actually possessed a Void King-Grade Secret Treasure? And it was being carried on Lu Ye's person?

Though he couldn't fathom why Liu Yun Valley would make such a choice, he resolved to take advantage of Lu Ye's grievous wound and kill him now; otherwise, once he recovered it wouldn't be so easy.

Thinking this, Yang Kai prepared to unfurl his Wind-and-Thunder Wings to pursue, when countless shouts reached his ears, tinged with panic and bewilderment.

They were the cries of the elites who had been scrambling for the Red Candle Fruit.

Qu Changfeng's roar of anger, Fang Tianzhong's attempt to block, Wei Guchang's alarmed cry, and Yin Sudie's shrill exclamation... all sounded almost at once — plainly something extraordinary had occurred over there.

Immediately Yang Kai heard a light crack as if something had broken, and then a beam of red light shot straight from the fighting ground toward the valley — and it was heading in his direction.

Yang Kai didn't hesitate; he reached out and grabbed it, for he sensed the red light held tremendous energy but was not an attack.

Warm to the touch, a rich fruity fragrance immediately drifted to his nose.

Yang Kai raised his brow, inspected the object in his hand, and cried out in surprise: "Red Candle Fruit?"

He had no intention of taking the Red Candle Fruit, yet this defiant spirit fruit had been struck flying amid the scramble and landed in his hand.

But it was not whole. It seemed cut by some sharp instrument — what he held amounted to only one-sixth of a whole Red Candle Fruit.

Fresh tender flesh was exposed and the potent scent spread. For a moment Yang Kai stood frozen.

Then alarmed, he instantly released his Divine Sense to probe the others. Soon his tension eased; those elites were still fighting over the Red Candle Fruit, but none could obtain a whole fruit — instead scores of people grouped together, staring at portions of the flesh.

"You dare..." Qu Changfeng roared, but before he finished an attack struck him silent. Then a cold man from Star Emperor Sect feinted and withdrew; under everyone's astonished and angry gaze he departed with composure and soon vanished.

No one tried to stop him — partly because a few slices of fruit still had disputed ownership, and partly because the man was far too powerful for one or two people to detain. Who would take on such a thankless task now? Eyes turned to the sliced pieces of fruit.

Chaos and another round of desperate snatching followed.

Seeing this, Yang Kai relaxed; while grieving the fruit's lost potency, he hurriedly rummaged through his Spatial Ring.

Such an otherworldly spirit fruit could not be stored in an ordinary jadebox; to preserve its efficacy it had to be kept in a wooden box.

Fortunately his Spatial Ring held suitable wooden material. In short order he produced a length of Qing Spirit Wood, then used Saint Yuan to fashion a crude wooden box in a few motions, placed the Red Candle Fruit flesh inside, and closed the lid, finally breathing easier.

Had he known this would happen he would have prepared a wooden box earlier and not been so flustered at the last moment.

The Qing Spirit Wood box was serviceable, but left like this for long the medicinal efficacy in the Red Candle Fruit flesh would surely drain away; Yang Kai would have to find time to treat it simply to prevent that.

For now he had no time and could only make do, waiting until he could spare a hand.

Moreover, delayed thus, his plan to pursue and slay Lu Ye had to be abandoned; the other had long since escaped beyond his Divine Sense and who knew where he had hidden.

Outside the valley, the unclaimed fragments of Red Candle Fruit flesh, after chaotic fighting, ultimately fell to a few families.

Those who seized the flesh were elated; those who failed beat their chests and sighed, some with murderous and restless glints in their eyes. Seven or eight corpses were left on the former battlefield, each dying in the most miserable fashion — who had slain them amid the scramble was unknown.

The battlefield had been utter chaos just now — secret treasures and martial skills flying everywhere, everyone fighting with all their might. No one had the attention to spare for anyone else’s situation. Thus, even though the forces who had lost their people knew their enemy stood right before them, they could not determine who it was and dared not act rashly. They could only swallow their fury along with their broken teeth, their bitterness worse than gall.

After the winners stored the fragments in their Spatial Rings, everyone, without exception, surged toward the valley.

It seemed someone had noticed a piece fly this way earlier and only now freed their hands to resume the scramble.

But inside the valley a red mist filled the air, rendering sight nearly useless; when Divine Senses were released they tangled, and now and then a muffled groan from someone ambushed sounded, so no one dared extend their Divine Sense too far.

They searched for most of the day; even as the red mist slowly dissipated no one found the piece that had flown in. Suspicious looks were cast around — each secretly suspected that some other faction had obtained the last fragment and kept silent.

Yang Kai felt secretly pleased. He had been worrying how to leave with the Red Candle Fruit flesh, but the valley's all-encompassing red mist had done him a favor — with every living person gathered here he could easily slip away in the chaos.

Daiyuan, however, stole a glance at Yang Kai and frowned in secret.

She remembered Yang Kai had been in the middle of his cultivation when the scramble occurred; if the Red Candle Fruit had flown this way, the most likely to have obtained it would have been Yang Kai.

But lacking concrete evidence and unwilling to betray him, she merely looked and returned to her composed stance.

Others shared Daiyuan's suspicion, but like her they had no proof; although some wished to probe Yang Kai, since he had been with Wei Guchang they dared not act rashly.

"Everyone, everyone..." Li Younan of Medicine Pill Sect stepped forward with a bitter smile, clasped his fists and said, "Please hear a word from Li."

The crowd looked on coldly; the factions that obtained the fragments watched warily, those who gained nothing were indifferent, yet all wanted to hear what Li Younan had to say, so the scene quieted.

"The Red Candle Fruit differs from ordinary spirit fruits — it cannot be stored in a jadebox. Now that that bastard has sliced it into pieces, it must not go into a jadebox; if you do so its efficacy will rapidly drain away. Before you even leave Flowing Flame Sandland this heaven-defying spirit fruit will have lost its power and turned to waste."

"Cannot be placed in a jadebox?" Qu Changfeng's face shifted and he hastily produced a jadebox from his ring.

The appearance of the jadebox drew avaricious looks from many who fixed their gazes on Qu Changfeng.

It seemed the Battle Sky Alliance's favored scion truly had skill — even amid such a scramble he had managed to seize one portion.

Fang Tianzhong, Yin Sudie, and a burly man of coarse features but imposing presence all stiffened and focused on Li Younan upon hearing this.

"If a jadebox won't do, what should be used? You must know," Qu Changfeng demanded bluntly.

Li Younan wore a self-satisfied expression and inclined his head: "Naturally I know."

“Brother Li, please enlighten us!” Fang Tianzhong cupped his fists slightly.

Li Younan chuckled darkly and returned the gesture. “I wouldn’t dare, I wouldn’t dare. It’s just that since childhood I’ve devoted myself to the study of alchemy, so my grasp of medicinal knowledge is a bit broader than most. As for the preservation method, I can certainly share it with you—but during that earlier battle, one of my Junior Brothers was gravely injured and nearly lost his life. As for who struck from the shadows, I already have my suspicions… though I won’t name names here.”

As he spoke his eyes swept the crowd, his manner measured and precise.

Only then did people realize his intent.

A few elites from Medicine Pill Sect had won nothing in the scramble; Li Younan was plainly trying to profit from the situation — otherwise he would not have made such a fuss over his junior brother's injury.

Normally no one would wound a Medicine Pill Sect elite disciple without reason, but times had changed — in the scramble who cared? No one had truly tried to kill him; a severe injury was not the same as death.

Besides, seven or eight elites had indeed died in the scramble; comparatively the Medicine Pill Sect man's luck was rather good.

Though they inwardly sneered, no one spoke up at that moment.

Fang Tianzhong furrowed his brow but, understanding the situation, said in a deep voice, "If Brother Li is willing to reveal the storage method, once we exit Flowing Flame Sandland Leitai Sect will reward one million Saint Crystals!"
