## Chapter 2042 — A Fortuitous Coincidence

In the Small Xuan Realm, Yang Kai sat cross-legged, his expression as calm and deep as an ancient well.

Not far in front of him, the Purple Void Cauldron stood upright; its lid was sealed, yet inside a ruthless spectacle was being played out.

From time to time came a bumping sound from within the Purple Void Cauldron, as if something were desperately striking against the alchemy furnace, trying to escape. Each time this happened, Yang Kai would pour a burst of force into the Purple Void Cauldron to suppress that resistance.

As time passed, the Purple Void Cauldron became intensely red-hot, the nearby space warping from the heat.

The commotion inside the cauldron grew ever weaker.

Only after a full day did the cauldron finally fall utterly silent; at the same time, Yang Kai at last received Liu Yan's call. He waved his hand, opened the Purple Void Cauldron, and Liu Yan immediately shot out as a streak of flame, whirling once before taking on human form before him.

"Master." Liu Yan called, then offered a small seed interlaced with gold and silver colors in her hand. "You may rest assured, Master. I guarantee it is dead beyond dying."

"Well done." Yang Kai nodded with satisfaction, took the strange Wood Seed, and poured his Divine Sense into it, discovering that, just as Liu Yan had said, the strand of soul-force that had once hidden inside the Wood Seed had been burned away completely.

That strand of soul-force had clearly belonged to Mu Xiao; if a soul-force did not perish, Mu Xiao would not die.

But after Yang Kai had thrown it into the Purple Void Cauldron and it spent a day and night with Liu Yan, how could that lingering thread of soul-force possibly have survived? It had long since been incinerated by the searing heat.

Now the seed in Yang Kai's hand could no longer be called a seed of Mu Xiao; it was the seed of Mu Xiao's original corporeal form before it had awakened to sentience.

What Mu Xiao's original corporeal form looked like before awakening, Yang Kai did not know—after all, he had never seen such a seed before.

But since it had endured a day's burning by both Liu Yan and himself without the slightest damage, it was clearly no ordinary thing.

If he planted this seed, in a few thousand or tens of thousands of years it might grow intelligent and become another Mu Xiao, yet it would have nothing whatsoever to do with the previous Mu Xiao.

"What do you plan to do with it?" Liu Yan glanced at Yang Kai and asked.

"I don't know. What do you think?" Yang Kai looked up at her.

Liu Yan shook her head. "Master, do as you see fit, but I can't help feeling that the two forces stirring within this seed will play no small part."

"Oh? What do you sense?" Yang Kai asked in surprise.

"It's only a feeling. If you pressed me, I couldn't put it into words." Liu Yan smiled.

Yang Kai lightly nodded, holding the strange Wood Seed and pondering for a moment, then his eyes suddenly brightened as he hit upon a good idea.

With that, he flickered and appeared directly at the herb garden in the Small Xuan Realm, found a secluded corner, brushed aside some soil, and planted the Wood Seed in the ground.

He did not know what this Wood Seed truly was or what use it served, but if he could get it to take root and sprout, perhaps he could find out.

And where in all the world would be more suitable for planting this Wood Seed than the herb garden of the Small Xuan Realm?

Beneath this plot of the herb garden lay countless layers of Heavy Earth, and five Earth Vein pearls supplied Spiritual Qi to the spot. Here, the Wood Seed's growth time would be greatly shortened; in only a few years Yang Kai could learn what it truly was.

After another careful inspection, Yang Kai clapped his hands with satisfaction, then flickered and returned to Liu Yan's side.

"This matter is handled. I am going back to Fenglin City. Come with me; there are some things I need to ask you," Yang Kai told Liu Yan.

"Very well." Liu Yan nodded, flickered into a streak of flame, and dove into Yang Kai's body, disappearing.

Only then did Yang Kai leave the Small Xuan Realm, orient himself, and speed toward the direction of Fenglin City.

......

At a place unknown many tens of thousands of li from Fenglin City stood the gate of Fei Sheng Palace.

Mountains surrounded it, mists steamed, and the palace gate of Fei Sheng Palace bore an imposing and magnificent aspect.

On one of the peaks among those mountains, a bare-chested old man whose beard and hair were completely white sat facing east, cross-legged with eyes closed. With each breath he exhaled a white breath from his mouth and nose that seemed to take on spirit, transforming into various birds and beasts that vanished into the deep mountain forest in the blink of an eye; from his posture it was unclear what esoteric art he was cultivating.

Just then the old man suddenly opened his eyes, and a murderous light in them seemed almost solid, chilling to the bone.

"Hmph, I said not to bother me unless it's important. Speak—what is it this time? If it's some trifling matter, watch your head!" the old man said coldly without turning his head.

Dozens of zhang behind him, a middle-aged man in a black robe froze at the words, sweat beading on his brow as he bowed at a distance and trembled, "Reporting to the Palace Lord: the Young Palace Lord's life token has shattered!"

From the middle-aged man's words it was clear that the old man was the Palace Lord of Fei Sheng Palace, Ning Boyang.

"Yuan Cheng's life token shattered?" Ning Boyang's expression suddenly chilled, and the temperature on the mountain peak dropped abruptly.

"Yes." The middle-aged man dared not raise his head as he answered gravely.

"Hmph, that brat truly was short-lived—shattered as it is, let it be." Ning Boyang said indifferently.

"Ah?" The middle-aged man was taken aback; he had not expected the father to be so apathetic about his son's death.

Could the Young Palace Lord have been an illegitimate child? The middle-aged man could not help but let his mind run wild with speculation.

"Since Yuan Cheng is dead, appoint Yuan Shu as the Young Palace Lord. See to it yourself; you need not trouble me further," Ning Boyang instructed.

The middle-aged man dared not be negligent and bowed quickly, "Yes; I will carry out the Palace Lord's orders."

"Also... although Yuan Cheng was worthless, he was still my son and the Young Palace Lord of Fei Sheng Palace! If someone dares to defile Fei Sheng Palace by doing as they please, that will not do. Investigate and find the hand that struck him; present me their head!"

"Yes!" The middle-aged man bowed again.

"Go." Ning Boyang waved his hand.

The middle-aged man wordlessly retreated.

......

At Star God Palace, the overlord of the Southern Territory of the Star Realm, a similar scene was unfolding.

In a secret chamber, a short old man was listening to a beautiful woman's report; after hearing it he furrowed his brow and said, "So that little bastard's life token truly shattered?"

"Reporting to Master: Junior Brother Han's life token did indeed shatter," the beautiful woman answered respectfully.

"That little wretch slips like an eel; even when I personally tried I could not pin down his trail. He actually died?" The old man snorted. "Worthless!"

"Master, calm yourself. Junior Brother Han is already dead. Whoever struck him has, in a way, cleared the way for you," the woman soothed.

"Cleared the way?" The old man snorted. "My sect requires no others to meddle in my affairs!"

"Disciple spoke improperly—Master, forgive me!" The woman immediately changed her expression.

"Go and investigate who struck the blow. Also... Junior Brother Han had a token in his hand. I care little for other things, but that token must be retrieved!" the old man said in a deep voice.

"A token?" The woman was startled and asked, "May I ask, Master, what kind of token?"

The old man glanced at her coldly, "If you truly see it, you will know what token it is—no need to say more now!"

"Very well. This disciple will hasten to see it done—Master, please await my good news." The beautiful woman dared not say another word and promptly withdrew from the secret chamber.

After she left, the short old man sat in brooding silence for a while before cursing, "Little beast. Lucky for you you did not die by my hand!"

......

"So you drifted into the Black Blood Swamp after leaving the Starlight Passage?" Yang Kai asked as he sped toward Fenglin City.

The Black Blood Swamp was not too far from Fenglin City—only just over a hundred thousand li—and Yang Kai had heard of the swamp's existence.

"Yes." Liu Yan's voice echoed in his mind. "I also knew that someone like me would easily attract others' covetousness, so I hid and did not show myself in public."

"Then what happened?" Yang Kai pressed.

"I fought many demonic beasts in that swamp; some sought to devour me, but I escaped unscathed. Later, while battling one beast, a passing expert discovered me—this fellow cultivated to the Second Stage of the Dao Origin Realm. He easily slew the beast and captured me, sealing me in a round bowl. Fortunately, his cultivation art was completely opposed to my attribute, so he had no designs on me. Hearing that Fenglin City would hold an auction, he brought me here." Liu Yan recalled her recent ordeals, still a little shaken.

"Hearing that, it truly was a fortuitous coincidence," Yang Kai smiled and nodded.

Meeting Liu Yan again did indeed involve many coincidences. Had he not come straight to Fenglin City after escaping Biyu Sect, he would have missed the later events and would surely have been separated from Liu Yan.

And once an existence like Liu Yan was captured, it would not likely survive long; she would either be merged into a Secret Treasure or directly devoured and absorbed by a martial artist to augment their strength.

"In any case, being reunited with Master is fortunate. By the way, Master, how is Xiaoxiao doing?" Liu Yan suddenly asked. As Yang Kai's two major aids, Liu Yan and Xiaoxiao had always been like his left and right arms in the Small Xuan Realm, and they cared for each other's fates.

Yang Kai's expression dimmed and he shook his head: "No news of it."

"Hopefully it is safe as well," Liu Yan said with a low tone.

In their home Star Domain, she and Xiaoxiao had been nearly invincible, but upon entering the Star Realm Liu Yan had found that there were many formidable people; if she could be captured and sealed, Xiaoxiao might well face the same danger.
